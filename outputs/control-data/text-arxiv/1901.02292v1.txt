We investigate the low-temperature magnetic properties of the molecule-based chiral spin chain
[Cu(pym)(H2 O)4 ]SiF6 ·H2 O (pym = pyrimidine). Electron-spin resonance, magnetometry and heat
capacity measurements reveal the presence of staggered g tensors, a rich low-temperature excitation
spectrum, a staggered susceptibility and a spin gap that opens on the application of a magnetic
field. These phenomena are reminiscent of those previously observed in non-chiral staggered chains,
which are explicable within the sine-Gordon quantum-field theory. In the present case, however,
although the sine-Gordon model accounts well for the form of the temperature-dependence of the
heat capacity, the size of the gap and its measured linear field dependence do not fit with the
sine-Gordon theory as it stands. We propose that the differences arise due to additional terms in
the Hamiltonian resulting from the chiral structure of [Cu(pym)(H2 O)4 ]SiF6 ·H2 O, particularly a
uniform Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya coupling and a four-fold periodic staggered field.

Quantum phase transitions can be driven between
gapped and gapless phases by applied magnetic field.
This was demonstrated in S = 1 quasi-one dimensional
(Q1D) chains [1] and S = 1/2 two-leg ladders [2–4].
These systems possess a spin gap that is closed by an
external field, leading to a transition to a gapless phase
which can be described by the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) theory [5]. In contrast, the excitation spectrum of S = 1/2 antiferromagnetic (AF) Heisenberg
chains with uniform nearest-neighbor interactions is gapless up to the saturation field. However, this ground
state is highly sensitive to small modifications. The dramatic effect of alternating local spin environments was
first discovered through high-field neutron scattering and
heat capacity experiments on the S = 1/2 AF staggered chain, Cu-benzoate [Cu(C6 D5 COO)2 ·3D2 O] [6].
Here, the presence of alternating g tensors as well as
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions produce an internal staggered field perpendicular to the external field.
The staggered field breaks rotational symmetry around
the applied field, leading to a field-induced spin gap
and anisotropic staggered susceptibility [7, 8]. This
gapped phase can be described using the sine-Gordon
(SG) quantum-field theory [8] and a complex excitation
spectrum is predicted including solitons, antisolitons and
soliton-antisoliton bound states called breathers [8–10].
Such excitations were experimentally confirmed by electron spin resonance (ESR) in the SG spin chain [pymCu(NO3 )2 (H2 O)2 ] (pym = pyrimidine) [11, 12]. So far
these studies have been limited to g tensors that alternate
with a two-fold periodicity along the chain.
In this letter, we report a detailed investigation of
the chiral chain [Cu(pym)(H2 O)4 ]SiF6 ·H2 O, in which

adjacent Cu(II) environments are related by 41 screw
symmetry [13].
At zero field, the magnetism of
[Cu(pym)(H2 O)4 ]SiF6 ·H2 O is well described by an S =
1/2 chain model and no long-range order is detected
above 0.02 K, as evidenced by muon-spin relaxation measurements [14]. Single-crystal ESR shows the presence of
staggered g-tensors, anisotropic staggered susceptibility
and a rich low-temperature excitation spectrum. However, the low-temperature field-induced excitation gap
observed in heat capacity is significantly suppressed compared to that of a traditional non-chiral staggered chain,
and has an unexpected linear field dependence. We propose this is due to additional interactions arising from the
four-fold periodic chiral structure. This study showcases
how the ground state of a Q1D AF chain is modified
when competing interactions are introduced and poses
a challenge to theorists to develop new models to fully
account for the data.
[Cu(pym)(H2 O)4 ]SiF6 ·H2 O crystallizes in chiral space
group P 41 21 2 [13]. Cu(II) ions are linked in chains by
N—C—N moieties of pyrimidine, which propagate the
intrachain exchange interactions (Fig. 1). The Cu coordination is a distorted octahedron consisting of CuN2 O2
equatorial planes [Cu—N 2.009(4) and 2.000(4) Å, Cu—
O 2.043(3) and 2.091(3) Å], and two O atoms in the axial
positions [Cu—O 2.197(3) and 2.227(4) Å] [13] consistent
with a Jahn-Teller elongation along this direction [15].
In this local symmetry, gk > g⊥ , where gk is the g factor
along the axial direction. Local environments of nearestneighbor Cu ions within a chain, and hence their local
g tensors, are related by a 90◦ rotation about the caxis. Interchain sites are occupied by H2 O and SiF2−

anions, leading to a minimum interchain Cu—Cu dis-

tance of 7.480 Å.
Room temperature ESR measurements were performed at 240 GHz employing a quasi-optic setup to
probe the g anisotropy. Representative spectra are shown
in Fig. 2(a). A single resonance due to the strong interaction between Cu(II) ions is observed [11, 16]. The
measured g factor is an average of the individual g tensors of the four magnetically inequivalent Cu(II) sites.
The strong coupling between spins and the four-fold
rotational symmetry ensure an isotropic ESR angledependence in the ab-plane, hence only two principal values, gmax = 2.21 and gmin = 2.10, can be extrapolated
from ESR data [Fig. 2(b)] and to obtain the g values of
the individual Cu(II) ions we must assume tetragonal local symmetry. Strictly the equatorial ligand pairs break
this symmetry, but in other materials with similar Cu(II)
environments for which the full g-tensor can be determined, it was found that ∆g⊥ = gx − gy is an order
of magnitude smaller than ∆g = gk − g⊥ [17], mitigating the tetragonal approximation. We note that relaxing
this assumption would have only a small effect on the
size of the staggered fields discussed later. The principal
g values of the individual Cu(II) ions are thus found to
be gk = 2.33 and g⊥ = 2.09. These values are similar
to those reported for Cu(II) ions in closely related local
environments [11, 17]. In the xyz laboratory frame [14]
the g tensor of the ith Cu(II) ion in a unit cell can be
separated into three components:

3 and 4 (see Fig. 1). gu corresponds to the uniform part
of the g-tensor, while g2s is a small staggered component

which repeats after every two nearest neighbour Cu(II)
ions. g4s , which we believe is so far unique to this material, is a much weaker staggered part with a four-fold
period along the chain, i.e. the same periodicity as the
unit cell. g2s is similar in form and size to that seen in Cubenzoate and [pym-Cu(NO3 )2 (H2 O)2 ] [7, 8, 11]. When
a field H is applied perpendicular to the chain, g2s will
generate a staggered field that can open an excitation
gap in the low-temperature spectrum.
Further variable frequency/temperature ESR measurements were performed in a broadband spectrometer. The
temperature dependence of the spectra below 20 K are
shown in Fig. 2(c). Upon cooling, the resonance shifts
to lower field and eventually splits into two as indicated
by arrows. Below 3 K, a series of resonances (marked by
squares) quickly emerge at high field (above g = 2) with
intensities that increase rapidly with lowering temperature, confirming the ground state nature of these excitations. The temperature and frequency [Fig. 2(d)] evolution of the lines cannot be explained by paramagnetic
resonances of transition metals [18] or conventional antiferromagnetic resonances. In fact, the data are reminiscent of excitations observed in [pym-Cu(NO3 )2 (H2 O)2 ],
where three branches were identified as breather modes of
the SG model, along with six other modes more difficult
to classify [12]. However, we find that the frequency-field
dependence of our resonances cannot be modelled by the
breather gaps proposed for SG chains [10, 12, 14].
Another important predicted feature due to staggered
g-tensors is the existence of a low-temperature staggered
susceptibility. Representative single-crystal susceptibility (χ) measurements performed down to 1.8 K are shown
in the inset to Fig. 2(e). Above 10 K, the susceptibility
can be well modelled as a uniform Heisenberg S = 1/2
chain [19] with AF exchange J = 42.3 ± 0.8 K. This
energy is consistent with the saturation field (≈ 65 T)
observed in pulsed magnetic fields [14]. The value of J
and lack of long-range order above 20 mK in zero field
imply an upper limit of 7 mK on the size of the interchain
coupling [20]. Below 10 K, an upturn in χ(T ) emerges
which can be described by an additional contribution
proportional to 1/T and the entire temperature range
can be fitted to χ(T ) = χ1D (T ) + χs /T where χ1D (T )
is the Heisenberg chain contribution. The staggered susceptibility χs exhibits a pronounced angular dependence
with its maximum value occurring when H is applied
perpendicular to the chain. The strong anisotropy of χs
confirms it is not due to paramagnetic impurities. Similar variation of χs is observed in Cu-benzoate [21] and
[pym-Cu(NO3 )2 (H2 O)2 ] [11] and identified as an intrinsic property related to the staggered field [22].

nuclear contribution [14]. In zero field above 0.5 K, the
nearly constant value of Cmag /T can be interpreted as
the heat capacity of a uniform S = 1/2 AF Heisenberg
chain in the TLL state, where Cmag = 2RT /3J [23, 24],
giving J = 41.9 ± 1.5 K in excellent agreement with the
magnetometry data.
The field-induced gap in [Cu(pym)(H2 O)4 ]SiF6 ·H2 O is
revealed by heat capacity measurements performed with
H ⊥ c. On warming from low temperatures, Cmag is
first suppressed below, and then rises above, the zerofield curve before meeting it at high temperature. This
behaviour is identical to that of the non-chiral staggered
chains [6, 11] and indicates the emergence of an excitation gap that increases with applied field. Given the
similarities with the non-chiral staggered chains, the expression for the temperature dependence of Cmag derived
from the SG model will provide the best possible estimate
of the gap in our system at a particular magnetic field.
However, fitting our data to the SG model [25] yields a
gap of ∆s = 1.98 K at 13 T, significantly smaller than
the expected value of 8.24 K, calculated using g2s and J
values obtained from ESR and magnetometry. More importantly, the field evolution of the gap exhibits ∆s ∝ H
[inset to Fig. 2(f)], which is distinctly different from the

expectation of the SG model, where ∆s ∝ H 2/3 [7].
It is clear that [Cu(pym)(H2 O)4 ]SiF6 ·H2 O exhibits the
staggered g-tensors, ground-state excitations and fieldinduced spin gap similar to those seen in the SG chains.
However, the size of the gap and its linear field dependence are inconsistent with theoretical predictions for a
traditional staggered system. We believe that we can
qualitatively account for the departures from the existing theories based on differences between the chiral and
non-chiral staggered structures.
The staggered fields in the existing model of Cubenzoate are compared to our chiral chain in Fig. 3. In
both cases the chains lie along Z and the applied field
H0 k X. For Cu-benzoate, a canted spin configuration,
caused by competition between AF exchange and H0 , is
stabilized in the XZ-plane by the same two-fold periodic
staggered fields h2s kZ that are responsible for the gap [8].
In contrast in the chiral system, the measured g-tensor
(Eq. 1) gives rise to two-fold staggered fields perpendicular to both H0 and Z. Thus if the spins adopt a canting
in the XZ plane, the coupling to h2s kY will be lost. This
would be a simple explanation for the observed suppression of the field-induced gap, but requires an additional
interaction, not present in previously studied staggered

chains, that would favor XZ over XY canting. The crystal symmetry of [Cu(pym)(H2 O)4 ]SiF6 ·H2 O permits such
an interaction in the form of an equal and opposite DM
interaction on nearest-neighbor chains. By symmetry,
the DM interaction of a given chain can be decomposed
into a uniform component parallel to the chain axis of
magnitude Du , and a four-fold periodic staggered component perpendicular to the chain axis. Including the
uniform DM term and applying H0 k X, the Hamiltonian can be written as,

where J is the intrachain AF exchange, which can now
possess a small anisotropy (λ ≈ 1).
The classical model of an S = 1/2 chain with
uniform gu and Du in a transverse H0 predicts
an incommensurate-commensurate transition at H0 =
πDu S, where the ground state at high fields is an AF
canted structure lying in the XY or XZ plane for λ < 1
or λ > 1, respectively. Recent quantum analyses of the
same model shows that XZ canting is preferred for a substantial field range, even with a weak easy-plane type exchange anisotropy (λ < 1) [26, 27]. In our case this would
effectively mitigate the effect of the small two-fold staggered field along Y . At low magnetic fields, the ground
state of the model is an incommensurate helical XY antiferromagnet with propagation vector along Z [26–28].
Averaged across the chain, this structure will also negate
the effect of the h2s term, which is commensurate, resulting in a reduced gap. Furthermore, the quantum
simulations show that a tiny field component parallel to

the chain, e.g. caused by experimental sample misalignment, will stabilize the gapless XY helical phase against
a strong transverse field [26], allowing the XY canted
phase that couples strongly to h2s to appear only in the
presence of a considerable easy-plane anisotropy. Hence,
we expect the ground state to show either an XY helix or XZ canting (or a mixture). In either case, the
coupling to h2s will be significantly weakened compared
to the staggered chains considered previously, leading to
suppression of the field-induced gap.
An interesting consequence of the chiral crystal structure with XZ spin-canting is that while h2s is perpendicular to the spins, the weaker staggered fields h4s = g4s H0
are parallel to Z [Fig. 3(b)] and so contribute to the excitation spectrum potentially producing a field-induced
gap. To explore this, we consider a spin-wave model of
an S = 1/2 Heisenberg chain in the XZ canted configuration with mutually perpendicular uniform and staggered fields. As noted earlier, in principle gx 6= gy ,
meaning that h4s acting on neighbouring ions need not
be identical. Nevertheless, the space group symmetry of
[Cu(pym)(H2 O)4 ]SiF6 ·H2 O requires that: (i) these staggered fields have a four-fold repetition; and (ii) nextnearest neighbors within a chain, which are related by
a 180◦ rotation, must experience equal, but opposite values. This is different to the staggered fields that open
the gap in Cu-benzoate, where h2s takes opposite values
on adjacent sites [Fig. 3(a)]. In both cases, the exchange
interaction ensures that the magnetic moment along the
chain is antiparallel for neighboring ions. The first order
spin-wave approximation suggests that the spin-canting
angle only depends on the external field H0  h4s and
the interaction J, specifically θi = θ = sin−1 (H0 /4JS)
for all spins. Thus the classical energy contribution of
the four-fold staggered field is:
E4s = cos θ(h4s S − h04s S − h4s S + h04s S) = 0,

(3)

where h4s and h04s are the staggered-field values on
odd and even sites, respectively.
This complete
cancellation implies that to first order in the spinwave approximation, the four-fold staggered field in
[Cu(pym)(H2 O)4 ]SiF6 ·H2 O has no contribution to its energy spectrum, whereas in Cu-benzoate the field-induced
gap is readily seen in the first-order perturbation [7].
Only when the analysis is extended to second order by
considering the corrections to the canting angles θj due
to h4s and h04s will a gap start to emerge [14].
Summarizing, we propose the key differences between the nature of the gap observed in chiral
[Cu(pym)(H2 O)4 ]SiF6 ·H2 O and the traditional staggered
chains reside in a low-temperature spin configuration
that decouples the system, fully or partially, from the
two-fold staggered field, and is favored by the presence
of a uniform DM interaction. In the event of a mixture of
XY , XZ or helical configurations, the effect of h2s on the
excitation spectrum is still important, but will be altered

5
from existing models. In addition, and particularly for
the situation of complete decoupling of the spins from
h2s , the added presence of the four-fold staggered field
necessitates new theoretical predictions for the size and
field-dependence of the gap, as well as for the excitation
modes seen in ESR. We note it is possible that in applied
field the XZ canted phase itself could exhibit a gap in
the absence of staggered fields [29].
The purely XZ canting shown in Fig. 3(b) relies on the
uniform DM interaction being significantly stronger than
h2s . We expect Du ∝ (∆g/g)J  h2s for the experimental field range, and the smooth linear evolution of the gap
up to 13 T [inset to Fig. 2(f)] suggests no abrupt spin orientation takes place, however the data do not permit an
unambiguous estimate of Du . We point out again that
a staggered DM interaction is allowed by the symmetry
of [Cu(pym)(H2 O)4 ]SiF6 ·H2 O and must be considered in
any future theoretical model.
Our results demonstrate that spin chains in which local
magnetic environments are related via screw symmetry
can present a remarkable suppression of the field-induced
SG spin gap via emergence of uniform DM interactions
and complex staggered fields. This opens up the possibility of searching for other materials where anisotropic
interactions and particular crystal symmetries conspire
to enable entirely novel magnetic states.

Supplemental Material
SAMPLES

Crystals of [Cu(pym)(H2 O)4 ][SiF6 ]H2 O grow as rod-like blocks with the long axis of the crystal parallel to the Cu—
pym chain. For the heat capacity measurements a sample of dimensions 7 × 2 × 1 mm3 was used. For susceptibility
measurements the sample was 6 × 1.5 × 1.5 mm3 . The ESR measurements made use of crystals with similar aspect
ratios. For the room-temperature measurements the sample length was 1.5 mm and for the low-temperature ESR
data the sample was 2 mm long.

MUON-SPIN RELAXATION

Zero field (ZF) muon-spin relaxation (µ+ SR) measurements were made at the ISIS Facility, Rutherford Appleton
Laboratory, UK using the EMU instrument and at the Swiss Muon Source, Paul Scherrer Institut, CH using the LTF
instrument. The polycrystalline sample was mounted on a silver plate using a thin layer of silicon grease. In a µ+ SR
experiment [30] spin-polarized positive muons are stopped in a target sample, where the muon usually occupies an
interstitial position in the crystal. The observed property in the experiment is the time evolution of the muon spin
polarization, the behaviour of which depends on the local magnetic field B at the muon site. Each muon decays,
with a lifetime of 2.2 µs, into two neutrinos and a positron, the latter particle being emitted preferentially along
the instantaneous direction of the muon spin. Recording the time dependence of the positron emission directions
therefore allows the determination of the spin-polarization of the ensemble of muons. In our experiments positrons
are detected by detectors placed forward (F) and backward (B) of the initial muon polarization direction. Histograms
NF (t) and NB (t) record the number of positrons detected in the two detectors as a function of time t following the
muon implantation. The quantity of interest is the decay positron asymmetry function, defined as
A(t) =

NF (t) − αexp NB (t)
,
NF (t) + αexp NB (t)

(S1)

where αexp is an experimental calibration constant. A(t) is proportional to the spin polarization of the muon ensemble.

FIG. S1. (a) ZF µ+ SR spectrum measured at 20 mK showing a contribution from two components. A fit is shown to Eq. (S2).

The ZF spectrum measured at 20 mK is shown in Fig. S1. We note that no oscillations or related signatures
are observed in the muon asymmetry, which strongly suggests that the material does not magnetically order at
temperatures above 20 mK. The measured spectra are found to contain two contributions. The first is a fast relaxing
component A1 which dominates the signal at early times and is well described by an exponential function exp(−λt).
The second is a larger, slowly relaxing component A2 , which dominates at intermediate times and fits to the KuboToyabe (KT) function fKT (∆, Bapp , t) [31] where ∆ is the second moment of the static, local magnetic field distribution

8
p
defined by ∆ = γµ h(B − hBi)2 i, Bapp is the magnitude of the applied longitudinal magnetic field and γµ (= 2π ×
135.5 MHz T−1 ) is the muon gyromagnetic ratio. The KT function is characteristic of spin relaxation due to a
random, quasi-static distribution of local magnetic fields at diamagnetic muon sites. We do not observe the recovery
in asymmetry at late times that is expected for the static KT function. The lack of this recovery is probably due to
slow dynamics in the random field distribution and is crudely modelled here with an exponential term exp(−Λt). The
data were found to be best fitted with the resulting function over the entire time range
A(t) = A1 fKT (∆, Bapp , t) exp(−Λt) + A2 exp(−λt) + Abg

(S2)

where Abg represents a constant background signal from those muons that stop in the sample holder. The fitted
magnitude of ∆ ≈ 0.5 MHz suggests that the random magnetic field distribution giving rise to the KT function is due
to nuclear magnetic moments, implying that the field due to electronic moments at these muon sites is motionally
narrowed out of the spectrum due to very rapid fluctuations. The observation of two distinct components, A1 and
A2 , in the asymmetry spectrum suggests that there are two distinct muon stopping states in the material. We note
that behaviour consistent with two muon sites has been observed previously in copper chain compounds with similar
structures.
From the observation that the material does not undergo a magnetic ordering transition above 20 mK, it is possible
to put an upper limit on any interchain interaction present in the system. The onset temperature of long-range order
in highly one-dimensional S = 1/2 antiferromagnets depends critically on the ratio of the interchain (J⊥ ) to intrachain
(J) exchange strengths [20]. Using the relation given in that reference, the lack of long-range order indicates that
J⊥ /J < 1.7 × 10−4 or J⊥ < 7 mK.

CRYSTAL SYMMETRY AND DZYALOSHINSKII-MORIYA INTERACTIONS

As for all exchange interactions present in the spin Hamiltonian, in the absence of symmetry-breaking order or
external fields, the antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction must respect the symmetry of the parent
crystal structure. The relevant term in the mean-field energy is typically written D · (Ŝi × Sˆj ), where the DM
interaction is represented by a time-even and parity-even pseudo vector (axial vector), D.
The crystal structure of [Cu(pym)(OH2 )4 ][SiF6 ]H2 O has space group P 41 21 2, and is composed of two chiral
Cu(pyrimidine) chains per unit cell with a common, global chirality. The two chiral chains are related by the 21
and 2 symmetry operators of the space group (note that both 21 and 2 operations do not switch structural chirality, which is formally represented by a time-even, parity-odd pseudo scalar). An individual chain has symmetry 41 ,
such that 4 Cu atoms bonded together via pyrimidine molecules complete a full chiral rotation per unit cell. When
occurring by itself, 41 symmetry supports a uniform Du parallel to the axis of the chain. The 41 symmetry also
supports a four-fold staggered Ds lying perpendicular to the uniform Du , which transforms in the same way as the
Cu-(pyrimidine)-Cu bonds.
Without loss of generality, the DM interaction in [Cu(pym)(OH2 )4 ][SiF6 ]H2 O can be decomposed into the two
orthogonal components, uniform and staggered, described above. We note, however, that the two terms in the
mean-field energy will have common components of the spins, such that they cannot be minimised independently.
Finally, we note that space group P 41 21 2 does not support a net D. The 21 and 2 symmetry operators give the
same configuration of staggered Ds on every chain, but opposite signs of the uniform Du for the two chiral chains in
each unit cell.

ELECTRON SPIN RESONANCE
Room-temperature electron spin resonance and staggered g tensors

In order to separate the uniform and staggered parts of the g tensors, it is convenient to define a laboratory frame
xyz based on the Jahn-Teller (JT) axes of the Cu(II) atoms. This xyz coordination is chosen such that the g tensors
for each Cu2+ spins can be separated into a uniform diagonal part, invariant for all spins, and staggered off-diagonal
parts. To achieve this, the x axis is set to be midway between the projections of two adjacent JL axes in the ab plane.
Therefore, the x axis lies within the ab-plane and it is rotated 7.5◦ away from the a axis. The z axis is parallel to the
crystallographic c axis. The conversion between the crystalline abc axes and the xyz frame is shown in Fig. S2 .

FIG. S2. Schematic plot showing the relationship between the crystalline abc axes and the laboratory frame xyz. The red
arrows represents the JT axes of Cu1 and Cu4, i.e. the local principal g axes, and the dashed lines indicate their projection
into the ab plane. The projection of the JL axis for Cu1 is 52.5◦ away from the a axis. The x axis lies halfway between the
projections of the JT axes for Cu1 and Ch4, making it 7.5◦ away from the a axis.

An anisotropic g tensor is expected for the Cu(II) spins due to the JT distorted octahedral coordination environment
surrounding the Cu(II) ions. The JT axis, defined as the elongated Cu—O bond, lies 9.1◦ out of the xy plane. The
local principal axis of the g tensor is expected to be parallel to the JT axis. Assuming tetragonal local symmetry, the
local g tensor is expected to take the diagonalized form:


g⊥ 0 0
(S3)
gloc =  0 g⊥ 0 
0 0 gk
with the gk component along the elongated JT axis (gk > g⊥ ). The local g tensors for individual spins can be
transformed to the global xyz coordination with the following Euler rotations:

θ = 80.9◦ (90 − 9.1), which is the tilting angle between the JT axis and the z axis. φi = 45◦ , 135◦ , 225◦ and 315◦ for
i = 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively, in consistent with the four-fold rotation of the local coordination environment about the
z axis. In the strong coupling limit, the average of the four Cu(II) sites within a unit cell give the g values observed

Eq. S8 is the field configuration in Fig. 3(b) of the main text. The two-fold staggered fields are in the y direction
while the four-fold staggered fields lies parallel to the z axis.
The room-temperature ESR resonance has the Lorentzian shape expected for an exchange-coupled system. The
linewidth (∆H) [Fig. 2(b) in the main text] has a strong angular dependence, probably due to the staggered g tensors
as well as DM interactions [32–34]. In the high temperature limit (kB T  J), when the isotropic exchange interactions
is large compared to the ESR linewidth (J  gµB ∆H), the ESR resonance is expected to have Lorentzian profile
with a linewidth [32]:
 3 1/2

(S9)
∆H =

6 B M4
M2 and M4 are the second and fourth moment of the resonance and their explicit expressions can be found in Ref. [32].
The wide ESR resonance suggests the existence of sizable DM interactions. However, we found it is difficult
to reproduce the extreme orientation dependence of ∆H, which varies between 50—550 mT. For instance, with
Du = 1.5 K, ∆H = 50 mT for H perpendicular to the c axis. Such a value of Du is reasonable as the magnitude of the
DM interaction is expected to be proportional to J × δg/g, where δg is the anisotropy in g. On the other hand, this
Du would lead to ∆H = 75 mT for H k c, which is significantly smaller than the experimental result. Furthermore,
we found it is impossible to simulate the angular dependence solely based on Eq. S9 with any combination of Du and
Ds . This suggests additional broadening effects need to be considered to explain the result. One possible candidate
is spin diffusion due direct flip-flop processes [35, 36]. These energy-conserving processes are maximal for H k c such
that all spins have the same resonance frequency, leading to extra broadening of the ESR signal. When the field is
rotated away from the c-axis, the resonance frequencies of the neighboring spin centers differ, suppressing the extra
broadening effect.
Low-temperature ESR results

The low-temperature multiple frequency ESR measurements were performed with a transmission type ESR spectrometer using a millimeter vector network analyzer as the microwave source and detector. The experiments were
performed with the applied field perpendicular to the crystal c axis. For a given frequency, the spectrum can be divided into the low-field and high-field regimes, as depicted by the dashed line in Fig. S3(a). In the high-field side of the
spectra, six strong resonances can be resolved and followed through the experimental frequency range. As we discussed
in the main text, these six resonances are reminiscent of the breather excitations observed in [pym-Cu(NO3 )2 (H2 O)2 ],
albeit only three breather modes were expected for the experimental field range.
One possible reason for the extra high-field resonances in our material is that the unit cell of
Cu(pym)(H2 O)4 ]SiF6 ·H2 O contains four inequivalent Cu2+ spins, double that for [pym-Cu(NO3 )2 (H2 O)2 ], although
it is not obvious exactly how the larger unit cell may lead to the additional resonances. Another possible explanation
is that the breather modes are affected by a field parallel to the chain axis, e.g. due to a small field misalignment.
This longitudinal field causes different effects to the chains with opposite Du . In this case, the signal could be due to
two groups of breather excitations, each with three modes as predicted by the SG model, arising due to differences
in the effective staggered fields between the two subspecies with opposite Du . This could also account for the similar
amplitudes of the resonances marked by open/filled black squares [see Fig. 2(c) in main text].
To explore this possibility within the existing model of non-chiral chains, attempts were made to fit the high-field
ESR resonances with two sets of breathers modes with different parameters. In the SG model, the nth breather gap
is expected to be [? ]:

FIG. S3. (a) ESR spectra for Cu(pym)(H2 O)4 ]SiF6 ·H2 O recorded at 1.9 K with the field applied perpendicular to the crystalline
c-axis. The spectra are separated into two regimes, the low-field part and the high field part, indicated by the dashed line in
(a). (b) and (c) Frequency vs field plot showing the high-field ESR transitions following the label scheme used in Fig. 2(c) in
the main text. The solid black lines are the best fit to the data using the sine-Gordon model described in Eq. S10 and S11.
The red line shows the linear dependence of the energy gap ∆ [Fig. 2(f) of the main text] as determined from heat capacity
measurements and converted into GHz units. This is everywhere lower than the ESR excitation frequencies, implying that the
minimum gap could be at a point in k-space not probed by ESR.

At a given field H, there are n = 1, ...[1/ξ] breather branches. ξ(H/J), vF (H/J) and Ax (H/J) in Eq. S10 and S11
are known [? ]. The value of ξ(H/J) varies between 0.3065 and 0.2585 in the experimental field range; hence three
branches are expected. J is the antiferromagnetic interaction between spins and is set to 42.3 K (see main text). The
only free parameter in the fitting is the effective staggered field coupling c = h2s /H, which should be close to g2s .
The best fits are shown in by the solid lines in Fig. S3(b) and (c). We found it is impossible to simultaneously fit
all three branches for either set of resonances. In addition, within each branch, the field dependence of the resonances
also deviate from the SG model considerably. Furthermore, the fits gives the c value of 0.011 and 0.013, significantly
smaller than the measured g2s . Therefore, we conclude it is impossible to model the low-temperature ESR spectra
with the SG model proposed for the two-fold staggered chains [? ? ].
Analyzing the low-field transitions in Fig. S3(a) is challenging due to the difficulty in classifying the resonances
within the experimental frequency/field range. In most spectra, a relatively broad peak is observed at low fields end
with a fine structure. As shown in Fig. 2(c) in the main text, upon cooling, the paramagnetic resonance shifts towards
lower field and eventually splits into two peaks. A similar low-temperature evolution of the ESR spectra has been
reported in Cs2 CuCl4 and K2 CuSO4 Br2 , which is attributed to the splitting of the spinon continuum around k = 0
when the magnetic field has a component along the DM interaction [37, 38]. However, the four-fold staggered DS
configuration makes it impossible for the field to be either parallel or perpendicular to all DM vectors, complicating the
ESR spectra. On the other hand, it is challenging to identify the other sharp resonances observed in the low-field part
of the spectra. Similar resonances were observed in the ESR study for [pym-Cu(NO3 )2 (H2 O)2 ] and were speculated
to be related to chain-edge effects [39? ].

is consistent with the value of the intrachain exchange constant as determined from both heat capacity and low-field magnetic
susceptibility.

HEAT CAPACITY

Subtraction of nuclear Schottky anomaly.

The heat capacity (Cp ) was measured as a function of temperature and magnetic field. In order to minimize the
contribution from nuclear spins at low temperatures, the measurement was performed with a deuterated sample,
[Cu(pym-D)(D2 O)4 ]SiF6 ·D2 O. Fig. S4(a) shows Cp /T recorded with the field applied perpendicular to the crystalline
c axis. At zero field, for T > 0.8 K, Cp can be well described with Cp = αT + βT 3 , where the first and second
terms correspond to the 1D spin correlation and the lattice contribution, respectively. Fitting the zero-field data gives
Clatt = βT 3 with β = 2.6 mJ/(mol K4 ). This Clatt contribution is independent of the applied field and is removed
from all data.
Upon cooling the sample, Cp exhibits a board peak when an external field is applied before a sharp upturn at the
lowest temperatures. Similar behavior was observed in the hydrogenated sample. The broad peak is related to the
field induced gap discussed in the main text. On the other hand, We found the low temperature upturns the can be
described as Cp ∝ T −2 and is likely due to a nuclear Schottky effect [40]. The nuclear heat capacity Cn is expected
to follow Cn = (a0 + a1 H 2 )/T 2 . a0 is due to nuclear quadrupole splitting of nuclei with nuclear spins I > 1/2 while
a1 is the nuclear Zeeman energy.
At zero field, the µ+ SR data shown no evidence of magnetic order above 20 mK and no spin gap is expected for a
S = 1/2 AFM chain. Therefore, below 0.2 K, the zero-field heat capacity data is fitted with Cp = a0 T −2 +αT , yielding
a0 = 27µJK/mol. The a0 value is then fixed with the a1 as the only variable in fitting the low-temperature Cp data
with a nonzero field. We found the data can be well fitted with a1 = 123 µJ K/(mol T2 ), giving Cn = (27+123H 2 )/T 2
µJ/(molK). This nuclear heat capacity was subtracted from all Cp data measured with the application of a magnetic
field [Fig. 2(f) in the main text].
We note the coefficient a1 is larger than expected from the nominal composition
of the sample. In principle, the
P
Zeeman energy contribution to the heat capacity can be calculated as a1 =
nI ~2 γI2 I(I + 1)/3kB . The summation
is over all atoms in the chemical formula with a nuclear spin I 6= 0. nI is the number of the nuclei per mole, ~ is
the Planck constant, γI is the gyromagnetic ratio, and kB is the Boltzmann constant. Based on the nominal chemical
formula of the deuterated sample, one would expect a1 = 57 µJ K/(mol T2 ). Indeed, we found the fitted value of a1
= 123 µJ K/(mol T2 ) would correspond to a H:D ratio close to 8:6, rather than all 14 H atoms are replaced by D. We
suspect this is due to partially rehydrogenation whereby H2 O replaces some of the D2 O during the crystal growth,
leading to the discrepancy between the nominal and experimental determined a1 values.

FIG. S5. (a) Result of fitting the simple two-level model (lines) described below to experimental Cmag /T data (points). (b)
Field dependence of the gap (squares) deduced from the fits in (a), as well as a best fit to a linear model (black line), a best
fit to the SG model (dotted blue line), and the size of the gap predicted by the SG model using the experimentally-determined
value of the two-fold staggered field (solid blue line).

Fitting to obtain the gap size.

The temperature-dependence of the heat capacity of a gapped system will have a broad Schottky-like hump whose
shape and position depends on the size of the gap and the degeneracy and distribution of excited states averaged
across the Brillouin zone. In the manuscript the magnetic heat capacity is fitted with a model derived from the SG
theory. While we stress that the SG model is not adequate to quantitatively account for many features of our data,
there are still strong similarities between our system and that of the SG materials, particularly the staggered g-tensors
and the richness of the excitation spectrum observed by ESR. Therefore the best possible expression that currently
exists to reliably estimate the size of the gap from the heat capacity of our system is that derived from the SG model.
Nevertheless, in order to show that the linear field dependence of the gap is not an artefact of using the SG heatcapacity expression, we also fit our data at fixed fields to a model consisting of a two-level system (Schottky anomaly)
plus a constant C/T term that accounts for the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid behaviour observed at high temperatures.
This is certainly not the ideal model to use to extract a reliable estimate of absolute size of the gap. This is because,
while the heat capacity will be strongly influenced by the gap between the ground state and lowest energy excited
state, any higher energy states will also have a significant effect. Such higher energy states are observed in the ESR
spectra, but are not taken into account in this simple model. Thus we would expect the absolute size of the gap
extracted in this way to be an overestimate.
This is what we observe in Fig. S5: panel (a) shows the result of fitting this two-level model to our data and it is
seen that the form of the data is reasonably well-described by the model. The points in panel (b) shows the size of
the gap and its evolution in field. This procedure illustrates several issues: (i) the form of the heat capacity data are
well described by a generic gapped model; (ii) the size of the gap extracted using this model, which is expected to be
a overestimate of the actual gap, is still smaller across the measured field range than that predicted by the SG model
using the experimentally-determined size of the two-fold staggered field in our material (solid blue line); and (iii) the
gap thus extracted has a linear field-dependence (black line) and cannot be described by the SG model even with a
staggered field much smaller than that measured (dotted blue line).

PULSED-FIELD MAGNETIZATION

Pulsed-field magnetization experiments used a compensated-coil susceptometry technique, described in [41]. Fields
were provided by the 65 T short-pulse and 100 T multi-shot magnets at NHMFL, Los Alamos. The susceptometer
was placed within a 4 He cryostat providing temperatures down to 1.6 K. Magnetic field was measured by integrating
the voltage induced in a ten-turn coil calibrated by observing the de Haas-van Alphen oscillations of the belly orbits
of the copper coils of the susceptometer. To create the traces shown in Fig. S4(b), data below 65 T taken using
the 65 T short pulse magnet were combined with data above 40 T taken using the 100 T multi-shot magnet. Both
experiments made use of the same sample and susceptometer.

FIG. S6. Schematic figure showing the XZ canted ground state and the staggered fields for [Cu(pym)(H2 O)4 ]SiF6 ·H2 O. The
plot shows the crystallographic unit cell of Cu(pym), which includes four spins named as S1 ∼ S4 . The black arrows represents
the spins for Cu(II) while the cyan arrows illustrating the arrangement of the staggered fields. The global and local coordination
systems are labelled by green and red colours, respectively.

SPIN-WAVE EXPANSION

We present a calculation for the excitation gap based on the standard spin-wave approximation for the XZ canted
structure with four-fold staggered fields h4s and h04s . In the following calculation, we define the XY Z frame as the
laboratory frame. The c axis of the chain is parallel to Z and a external field H0 is applied in the X direction. The
xi yi zi frames represent the local coordination systems for the ith Cu2+ ion where zi axes are defined by the direction
of the ith spin (Fig. S6). With an external field applied perpendicular to the chain, the four-fold staggered fields are
parallel to the chain propagation direction (c-axis). This is the situation illustrated in Fig. S6 (also see Fig. 3(b) in the
main text). The magnitudes of staggered fields, h4s and h04s , depend on the explicit form or the staggered gm ethrm4s
and can be treated as twin independent parameters. However, as long as the field is applied within the XY plane, the
resultant four-fold staggered field should always be parallel to the Z axis. The canted antiferromagnetic configuration
of the spins, as well as the polarities of stagger fields, are illustrated in Fig. S6. The canted angles, θn (n = 1 to 4),
are determined by both the external field H0 and the staggered fields. Therefore, Eq. 3 in the main text does not hold
rigorously due to the possibility that θ1 6= θ2 6= θ3 6= θ4 . The energy per unit cell of the canted antiferromagnet state
is:
E = − JS 2 [cos (θ1 + θ2 ) + cos (θ2 + θ3 ) + cos (θ3 + θ4 ) + cos (θ4 + θ1 )]
− H0 S[sin θ1 + sin θ2 + sin θ3 + sin θ4 ]

(S12)

+ h4s S(cos θ1 − cos θ3 ) − h04s S(cos θ2 − cos θ4 )
This energy is minimized for ∂E/∂θn = 0, which gives:

(S13)
= JS 2 [sin (θ2 + θ3 ) + sin (θ3 + θ4 )] − H0 S cos θ3 + h4s S sin θ3 = 0
= JS 2 [sin (θ3 + θ4 ) + sin (θ4 + θ1 )] − H0 S cos θ4 − h04s S sin θ4 = 0

The staggered fields, h4s and h04s , are much smaller than H0 . The canted angles, θn , are mostly determined by H0
while the staggered fields lead to a small correction to θn . Therefore, the canted angles can be written as θn = θ + δθn
where θ = arcsin (H0 /4JS) is the canted angle induced by H0 . δθn ’s are the small corrections caused by the staggered

15
fields and θ  θn . Hence, Eq. S13 can be written as:
16J 2 S 2 δθ1 + (8J 2 S 2 − H 2 )(δθ2 + δθ4 ) = 2h4s H0
16J 2 S 2 δθ2 + (8J 2 S 2 − H 2 )(δθ1 + δθ3 ) = −2h04s H0
16J 2 S 2 δθ3 + (8J 2 S 2 − H 2 )(δθ2 + δθ4 ) = −2h4s H0

(S14)

16J 2 S 2 δθ4 + (8J 2 S 2 − H 2 )(δθ1 + δθ3 ) = 2h04s H0
Solving Eq. S14 leads to a simple correlation between δθn and the staggered fields that:

At this point, it is more convenient to write the staggered field in terms of δθn . Comparing Eq. S15 with Fig. S6, we

The first four terms of Eq. S22 correspond to the spin wave expansion for a uniform antiferromagnetic chain in the
presence of a external field H0 without any staggered field. The fifth and sixth terms are the linear contribution of
2
h4s and/or h04s while the remaining two parts are proportional to h24s and/or h04s . By Fourier transforming Eq. S22,
it can be found that the fifth and sixth terms vanish because that the values of δθn oscillate between ±h4s H0 /8J 2 S 2
(or ±h04s H0 /8J 2 S 2 ). Therefore, the Hamiltonian is:

In the absence of staggered fields, E− = 0 and Eq. S27 gives the gapless excitation expected for uniform antiferromagnetic chains. Non-zero four-fold staggered fields lead to a excitation gap (∆) with the magnitude of the gap

Eq. S28 shows that the excitation gap is proportional to (h24s + h04s 2 )H02 /J 2 S 2 . The staggered fields are much
smaller than the applied field H0√and the antiferromagnetic interactions JS. Therefore, comparing with the excitation
gap in Cu benzoate [7, 8] (∆ ∝ hJS) calculated with similar spin-wave expansion technique, the gap in Cu(pym) is
expected to be much smaller. We note that by taking into account 1D critical fluctuation, the power-law behavior of
the gap in Cu benzoate is changed from h1/2 to h2/3 . We expected similar corrections should also be applied to our
calculations, modifying the prediction of the field induced gap.
