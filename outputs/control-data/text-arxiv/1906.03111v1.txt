This mini-review addresses a bedrock problem for the advance of phononics: the building of
feasible and efficient thermal diodes. We revisit investigations in classical and quantum systems. For
the classical anharmonic chains of oscillators, the most used model for the study of heat conduction
in insulating solids, we recall the ubiquitous occurrence of thermal rectification in graded systems,
and we show that the match between graded structures and long range interactions is an efficient
mechanism to increase the rectification factor. For the cases of genuine quantum models, we present
the spin chains, such as the open XXZ model, as profitable systems for the occurrence of thermal
rectification and other interesting related properties. In particular, we describe two cases of perfect
diodes: one for the spin current, in a two-segmented XXZ model, and another one for the heat
current in a simple quantum Ising model with long range interactions. We believe that such results
involving interesting rectification properties in simple models will stimulate more theoretical and
experimental investigations on the subject.

INTRODUCTION

Two preeminent physical mechanisms of transporting
energy, especially from a practical viewpoint, are conduction by electricity and by heat. But their status in science
are quite different. On one hand, we have the amazing
development of modern electricity that transformed our
daily lives with the creation of technological apparatus,
possible due to the invention of electrical diodes, transistors and other non-linear solid states devices. On the
other hand, however, considering the manipulation of
heat currents and management of thermal circuits, the
scenario is much poorer, consequence of the lacking of
viable and powerful thermal diodes.
The thermal diode, or rectifier, is a system in which the
magnitude of the heat flow changes as it is inverted between two thermal baths, i.e., it is a system with a preferable direction for the heat current. The thermal diode
is the basic ingredient of the devices aiming the control
of the heat flow. The phenomenon of thermal rectification was first observed by Starr in the 1930’s [1], but
the first manageable theoretical model for the thermal
diode was proposed only in 2002 [2]. The most recurrent
proposals of diode, including this first one, are given by
the sequential coupling of two or three segments of different classical anharmonic oscillators. Unfortunately, they
present critical problems: the rectification power is small
and rapidly decays to zero as the system size increases.
This mini-review is focused on several attempts devoted to overcome this difficult problem, i.e., devoted to
the building of a feasible thermal diode with a big rectification factor. Having in mind the disclosure of the
ingredients responsible for the phenomenon, we consider
only “simple” classical and quantum models. However, it
is worth to recall the existence of other intricate schemes
(ignored here) involving geometry or complicate interactions. For example, carbon nano-structures with elaborate shapes and asymmetries [3], graphene nanoribons

[4, 5], etc. In Ref.[6], a rectification factor of 350% is reported in a graphene nanoribon with a quite specific twodimensional trapezium shape. More details about these
elaborate proposal with geometrical nanostructures are
found in Ref.[7].
Most of the models used in the investigation of the microscopic mechanisms of heat current are given by classical dynamical systems. However, the possibility of effects
of quantum nature in low temperatures, together with
the present ambient of device miniaturization, makes
mandatory the study of energy flow in genuine quantum
models. Therefore, we visit some recent works on quantum spin chains such as the XXZ model, in which rectification ubiquitously holds. Our results include cases of
perfect rectification: one of the spin current and another
one of the heat flow.
The rest of this mini-review is organized as follows. In
the second section we present some results involving the
classical chains of oscillators. In the third section we turn
to the genuine quantum models, here given by quantum
spin chains. The last section is devoted to final remarks.

CHAINS OF CLASSICAL OSCILLATORS

Since the pioneering works of Debye [8] and Peierls [9],
the most recurrent models for the study of heat conduction in insulating solids are given by chains (lattices) of
anharmonic oscillators, precisely, by systems of N oscillators with Hamiltonian such as

where mj is the mass of the j-th oscillator; q and p are

2
λ, Mj > 0; Jjl = Jlj = f (|` − j|), f with some integrable
decay; P is the anharmonic on-site potential, for example, P (qj ) = qj4 /4. Excellent reviews on this and related
problems are found in Refs. [7, 10, 11]. The dynamics of
the systems involves the coupling with the baths and are
usually given by the stochastic differential equations
dqj = pj dt, dpj = −

where the baths Bj are independent Brownian motions,
with zero average and diffusion equal to 1
hBj (t)i = 0, hBj (t)B` (s)i = δi,j min(t, s),

(3)

ζj is the constant coupling between site j and its reservoir; γj = 2ζj mj Tj , where Tj is the temperature of the
j-th bath. For the case of baths only at the boundaries
we take ζj = 0 for j = 2, . . . , N − 1.
To study the heat flow, we write the total energy as the
sum over the energy of each single oscillator, and then we
analyze the continuity equation associated to this energy.
Precisely, we write

Fj→ denotes the heat current from site j to the forward
sites ` > j; F→j describes the current from the previous
sites ` < j. Rj gives the energy flux between the j-th site
and the j-th reservoir: it is zero for j = 2, . . . N − 1 in
the case of baths only in the boundaries, and it also vanishes for the case of inner reservoirs in the self-consistent
conditions (details ahead). The expressions show us that
the heat current is given by simple two-point correlation
functions. Anyway, the nonlinear dynamical equations
for the case of anharmonic potentials make exceedingly
difficult their analytical study.
The easier harmonic case λj ≡ 0 has analytical solution, see the seminal paper of Rieder, Lebowitz and Lieb

[12], and also the very interesting article by Casher and
Lebowitz [13].
Unfortunately, as well known, the pure harmonic chain
of oscillators does not obey the Fourier’s law: the regime
of heat transport is ballistic, the flow does not decay
with the system size. Moreover, there is no thermal rectification in any asymmetrical version of the harmonic
chain. Thus, in the search for thermal rectification, we
are forced to consider some anharmonicity in the models.
In this direction, the self-consistent harmonic chain is
an old proposal of effective anharmonic model [14], recurrently revisited [15–17]. It is given by the harmonic chain
of oscillators with inner stochastic reservoirs (ζj 6= 0 also
for j = 2, . . . , N −1 in Eq.(8)), whose temperatures, however, are chosen such that there is no net heat flow between an inner reservoir and its linked site in the steady
state. That is, the self-consistent condition guarantees
that, in the steady state, the heat current across the chain
is supplied only by the baths at the boundaries. The inner stochastic reservoirs describe only some mechanism of
phonon scattering, i.e., they are a footprint of the anharmonic potentials absent in the Hamiltonian. Such a trace
of anharmonicity seems to be indeed present: in the harmonic chain of oscillators with self-consistent inner baths,
Fourier’s law holds [15, 16], in contrast with the ballistic purely harmonic chain. However, in any asymmetric
version of this model, there is no rectification [18, 19].
At this stage, it worth to recall that, in Ref.[20], we
propose an effective harmonic classical model, with extra
temperature dependent harmonic potentials, which represent, in some sense, the dynamical average effect of the
absent anharmonic potentials. Asymmetrical versions of
the model rectify. It helps us to understand that a temperature dependence of some inner structure or mechanism is crucial for the phenomena occurrence, but the
problem of a large rectification factor is left open.
The most recurrent models of thermal diodes involve
genuine anharmonic systems, precisely, they are given
by the coupling of two or three segments with different anharmonic potentials [2, 21]. The rectification phenomenon here is explained by the idea of phonon-band
matching (miss-matching), but the small rectification
factor together with a rapid vanishment with the system size increasement points out the necessity of different
proposals.
In the search of general properties, i.e., solutions independent on the specificity of the model, an iteresting
attempt appears with the use of graded materials, aiming the growth of asymmetry and, consequently, of the
rectification in the chain. Graded models are inhomogeneous systems whose structure changes gradually in
space. They can be found in nature and can also be
manufactured, having attracted interest in many areas
[22]: electricity, optics, mechanics, etc.
The first work on rectification in graded systems [23]
was carried out in a model with a Fermi-Pasta-Ulam β
potential and graded mass distribution, with mj always
changing between two fixed values, Mmax and Mmin ,

3
which, in some sense, inhibits the growth of asymmetry
as the size of the chain increases. The authors show the
occurrence of thermal rectification and also the existence
of regions with negative differential thermal resistance.
Analytical results indicating the ubiquity of thermal
rectification in graded systems appear in Refs.[24, 25].
Sufficient conditions for the occurrence of the phenomenon are established [25], and the possibility of enhancing the rectification as one increases the asymmetry
together with the system size is pointed out. In particular, the ubiquity is made transparent with the on-set of
rectification in a quite simple, naked model of bars and
graded bullets with elastic collisions [26], now by means
of computer simulations.
Anyway, the establishment of conditions which guarantees the occurrence of thermal rectification in anharmonic
graded chains does not suppress the necessity of a large
rectification factor. In such a direction, some works appear with ideas of general scope. Precisely, graded chains
with long range interactions (LRI) are detailed studied
in Refs.[27, 28], i.e., systems of N oscillators with Hamiltonian such as

where qj gives the displacement of the jth oscillator; pj
its momentum; mj is the mass, which has a graded distribution; λ is the power for the polynomial decay with
distance of the interparticle interaction.
Here, the scenario is the following. First, we expect
the occurrence of rectification with the anharmonicity
and the graded distribution. Intuitively, the LRI favors
the heat flow with the addition of new links, i.e., new
channels for the heat transport. More importantly, these
new channels connect distant particles with very different
masses. In other words, the LRI favors the asymmetry,
which in turn favors the increase of rectification. Moreover, as we increase the system size with the graded mass
distribution, new particles are introduced, creating new
asymmetric channels of heat transport due to the LRI. In
short, we expect that, in a graded system with LRI, the
thermal rectification will be bigger and will not decay as
the system size increases. Analytical investigations [27]
and detailed numerical simulations confirm these statements [28]. See Fig.1. There, the rectification factor
versus the system size is depicted for systems with LRI
and nearest-neighbor interaction. The rectification fac−)
tor is defined as fr = (F+F−F
× 100%, where F+ and
−
F− represent, respectively, the larger heat flow and the
smaller heat flow, which are measured by inverting the
temperatures of the baths at the two ends of the chain.
It is worth to note that, for the case of the hot and cold
temperatures given by TH = 9.9 and TC = 0.1, N = 64,
m1 = 1, mN = 10, λ = 1.2, we obtain the significative
value fr = 4638%.
Some further comments are convenient here. Besides
its role played in rectification, the investigation of LRI

Triangles are for LRI with λ = 1.2, circles are for LRI with
λ = 1.4, squares are for the NN case. The mass gradient is

Ref.[28].

in heat transport is intricate and deserves attention by
itself, see, e.g., Ref.[29] and references there in. It is also
interesting to note the proposal of mechanisms for the
thermal rectification far away from complicate geometrical shapes and also from the graded distribution and LRI
used here: in Ref.[30], for example, the authors show the
phenomenon occurrence in a homogeneous chain with a
local modification of the interactions at one site only.

QUANTUM SPIN CHAINS

The detailed investigation of genuine quantum models
becomes a must, given the existence of quantum effects
in the low temperature heat conduction. The study is
also highly stimulated by the present ambient of miniaturization in science due the advance of nanotechnology,
lithography, etc.
In the context of systems of oscillators, we recall that
the quantum harmonic chain with inner reservoirs in the
self-consistent condition is examined in Refs.[18, 31–33].
Interestingly, in opposition to the behavior of the classical
self-consistent harmonic chain, now, due to the quantum
nature of the inner reservoir that brings temperature to
the bulk of the system, there is thermal rectification in
the quantum graded version [18, 32, 33].
However, a more interesting class of models appears
here: the quantum spin chains, such as the XXZ open
system. These models seems to be more treatable than
the quantum anharmonic chains and, besides that, there
is a huge interest in the study of such models by themselves: XXZ is the archetypal model to the study of
open quantum systems, with recurrent and increasing

4
attention in several areas, such as optics, cold atoms,
condensed matter, quantum information [34, 35].
The one-dimensional, spin 1/2 XXZ model with N
sites, nearest-neighbor interactions and in the presence of
an external magnetic field B is given by the Hamiltonian

σ1 and fL . In the formulas above, {·, ·} denotes the anticommutator; σj± are the spin creation and annihilation
operators σj± = (σjx ± iσjy )/2 ; γ is the coupling strength
to the spin baths; fL and fR are the driving strength.
In this first case considered here, the baths are modeled
z
in terms of extra spins σ0z and σN
+1 linked to the chain,
and so, fL and fR describe different spin polarization at
z
the boundaries: precisely, fL = hσ0z i and fR = σN
+1 .
In what follows, we take homogeneous Ji,i+1 ≡ J and
graded asymmetry parameter ∆i,i+1 .
Turning to the currents for the quantities spin and energy, precise expressions can be derived from the continuity equation and from the LME for the dynamics. For
the spin flow, we have

It is also quite convenient to separate the energy current into two parts, namely,
hFi i = hFiXXZ i + hFiB i ,

(21)

where the XXZ contribution is (for 2 ≤ j ≤ N − 1)
hFjXXZ i = ih[hj−1,j , hj,j+1 ]i = . . .

(23)

where Jj is the spin current, already defined.
It is interesting to remark that, for the homogeneous
XXZ chain in the presence of an uniform magnetic field
B, we have hFjXXZ i = 0 [36], and so, hF i = BhJ i, that
is, the total energy current essentially coincides with the
spin current. Moreover, for the case of a graded chain,
it follows that hF i = hF XXZ i + BhJ i, where, due to

5
arguments of symmetry in the LME [37], hF XXZ i is a
nonvanishing even function of f , and hJ i is an odd function of f (the spin current direction is always determined
by the direction of the magnetization imbalance). Thus,
the thermal rectification is transparent, i.e., the change
in the magnitude of the energy current as we invert the
baths (f ↔ −f ): the energy current is given by the sum
of an even and another odd function of f . Such ubiquity
of the thermal rectification occurrence is confirmed by
direct calculations, in different situations, of the currents
in the steady state of the model [38]. It is also immediate,
in the case of a zero magnetic field B, the occurrence of
the “one-way street” phenomenon, i.e., as hFjXXZ i is an
even function of f , the direction of the energy current in
graded system will not change as we invert the baths. It
will be determined only by the asymmetry in the graded
chain. Recall that, in the homogeneous chain, we have
hFjXXZ i = 0, as said. The thermodynamic consistency of
this phenomenon is shown by splitting the energy current
into heat and power (work), see details in Refs.[39, 40].
In fact, as richer as the equilibrium XXZ model, which
presents ferro, antiferro, gapless phases, etc., here, the
open XXZ graded chain gives us a privileged scenario.
Let us give a further example, concerning the occurrence
of thermal rectification and manipulations of the heat
flow. By choosing the interaction parameters we can
build a graded material such that we have rectification in
one direction (e.g., the larger heat current flowing from
the left to the right side). Then, it is possible to get the
reversal of rectification (i.e., larger flow from the right
to the left side) by adding a proper external magnetic
field, but keeping the material without changing its parameters [41]. In a few words, we observe in the model
the occurrence of themal rectification as well as the possibility of getting its reversal by means of an external
magnetic field.
Another problem of interest is the investigation of two
segmented XXZ system, which imitates the first models of classical diodes, given by the coupling of different anharmonic segments. Instead of a graded system,
we take a bipartite chain, both with the same J (the
XY coupling), see Eq.(10), but with different ∆, i.e.,
∆j,j+1 = ∆L for j < N/2, and ∆j,j+1 = ∆R for the
other half j > N/2. We couple the chain to two different baths at its edges, each one tending to impose a
particular magnetization to the system. Precisely, we assumeP
the dynamics given by a LME with the dissipator
D = n=1,N Dn , where


+ (1 − λn ) σn− ρσn+ − 1/2 σn+ σn− , ρ
. (24)
The parameter γ above gives the intensity of the coupling to the baths; the spin magnetization imposed by
the baths is set by λn . We assume λ1 and λN equal to
0 or 0.5, i.e., on one side of the chain the bath tends to
set the spins to be pointing down (|↓in h↓| for λn = 0),
or to be in an equal mixture of up and down spins

FIG. 2: (Color online) We plot, as a function of the anisotropy
∆L /JL for different chain lengths N , the forward (a), reverse
currents (b), the rectification coefficient (c) and the contrast
(d). The current in reverse bias is significantly lower than in
forward bias. Rectification R (e) and contrast C (f) as functions of the system size for different values of the anisotropy

system size for large enough anisotropy ∆L /JL . At the junction between the two halves of the chain ∆N/2 = ∆M and
JN/2 = JM . The other parameter values are ∆R = ∆M = 0,
JL = JR , JM = JL and γ = JL /~ for (a-d), while JM = 0.1JL
and γ = 0.1JL /~ for (e-f). The plots are borrowed from
Ref.[42].

([| ↓in h↓ | + | ↑in h↑ |]/2 for λn = 0.5). The imbalance
λ1 − λN imposed by the baths provokes a spin current.
For the case λ1 > λN , which we name as “forward bias”,
the spin current flows from left to right, and the opposite,
the “reverse bias”, corresponds to λ1 < λN , in which the
current flows from right to left.
We use two quantities to measure the spin rectification.
Namely, the coefficient R = −Jf /Jr , and the contrast
C = |(Jf + Jr )/(Jf − Jr )|. We have R = 1 and C = 0
for the absence of rectification, and for a perfect diode,
R and C tend to infinity and 1 respectively. We perform
a study taking ∆R = 0 and different values for ∆L /JL
[42]. Surprisingly, and contrasting with the behavior of
the classical chains of oscillators, we find a huge spin
rectification that increases with the system size, tending
to a perfect diode, for ∆L /JL > 3. See Fig.2.
For this two segmented XXZ chain but with global
baths acting on all eigenstates of the Hamiltonian system
(details ahead), we study the heat rectification and show
that it can be large if the interaction is strong enough in
one half of the chain and if one bath is at a cold enough
temperature [43]. In short, for the heat flow, we obtain
a big rectification, but not a perfect diode.
To go further in the search for suitable thermal diodes,
it seems profitable to keep studying spin chains, but possibly some simplified model instead of the intricate XXZ

6
chain. Discarding intricate effects and interactions may
be useful to understand the minimal ingredients behind
the rectification phenomenon.
Thus, we turn to the quantum Ising model, say, a simple component of the Heisenberg (XXZ) family. Precisely, we take a quantum spin chain with Hamiltonian

where σiz is the z Pauli matrix at site i. We couple the
chain to two different baths at left (L) and right (R) sides,
by assuming the spin-boson coupling in the x component
[35]. In the microscopic approach, precisely, using the
Born-Markov approximation, we obtain the LME with
the dissipator D = DL + DR , where, for DL (similarly for

We offer an explanation for the occurrence of rectification in a so simple spin chain. The baths, which act
on all the Hamiltonian eigenstates (which in turn involve
the inner sites), have an elaborate temperature dependence due to their quantum nature. In the study of the
heat current, such a temperature correlation appears in
the expressions for the heat current computation involving the inner sites. Thus, we have an asymmetry in the
structure, e.g., a graded system, together with an asymmetrical temperature dependence. As we invert the thermal baths, the temperature distribution changes, but not
the inner structural asymmetry. Consequently the framework behind the heat current changes and thermal rectification appears. We believe that the rule played by the
LRI here is only to break some hidden symmetry that
prevents the on-set of heat current in many-body chains
with nearest-neighbor interactions. Sometimes, due to
the existence of symmetries in the LME and in the density matrix, some spin chains have zero spin or energy
currents even in the presence of strong boundary gradients [36].

The rectification phenomenon in such model is investigated in Ref.[44], for the case of nearest-neighbor interaction and N = 2, i.e., for the simpler case of a junction, not
a many-body system. A regime of perfect rectification is
described. However, we need to remark that for spin
models, sometimes there is a drastic difference between
the junction and the many-body chains. For example, in
Ref.[45], for the case of a homogeneous XXZ model with
target polarization at the boundaries and asymmetric external magnetic field, the authors show the existence of
spin rectification for N > 2, but it does not exist for
N = 2. Here, for the quantum Ising model, if we keep
only nearest-neighbor interactions, there is also a drastic difference: there are heat current and rectification for
N = 2, and no heat current for N > 2 [46]. Interestingly,
in the presence of long range interactions capable to link
the first to the last site of the chain, the heat current
reappears together with the possibility of a perfect rectification if the temperature of one of the baths goes to
zero [46].

FINAL REMARKS

This mini-review focuses on attempts devoted to the
search of mechanisms leading to the increasement of the
thermal rectification in general materials, with the aim
of building efficient and feasible thermal diodes. We describe some findings on classical and on quantum systems.
For the case of classical chains of anharmonic oscillators, the most recurrently used model for the study
of heat conduction in insulating solids since Debye and
Peierls, we describe the ubiquitous occurrence of heat
rectification in graded materials. Moreover, we consider
the study of the mechanism of heat conduction in the
presence of long range interactions, which is an interesting problem by itself. We show that the combination of
graded structures with long range interactions can really
increase the rectification factor.
In the quantum regime, we present the spin chains as
appropriate materials for the investigation energy rectification. We describe interesting properties for the spin
and energy currents, such as the possibility of energy
rectification reversal, due to manipulations in the external magnetic field. Moreover, we show two cases of perfect diodes: one for the spin current in a two-segmented
XXZ model, and another for the heat current in a simple graded quantum Ising model with interaction long
enough to link the first and last sites.
We are confident that such results describing interesting properties of thermal rectification in simple models
and mechanisms, i.e., we may say, the description of a
minimal itinerary for large rectification, will stimulate
more theoretical and also experimental research on the
theme.
