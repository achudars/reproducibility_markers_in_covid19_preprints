Abstract

Cosmological solutions of Einstein’s equation for fluids with heat flow in a generalized Robertson-Walker metric
are obtained, generalizing the results of Bergmann.

Introduction:

We consider Einstein’s equation of general theory of relativity for a fluid with heat flow having the following
energy-momentum tensor
T αβ = (ρ + p)v α v β − pg αβ + q α v β + q β v α ,

(1)

where, p and ρ are the isotropic pressure and matter density of the fluid respectively, qα is the heat flux in the
radial direction, and vα is the velocity vector. In the co-moving coordinate system, v α = δ0α , vα v α = −1 and
qα v α = 0 , along with the generalized Robertson-Walker line element
ds2 = A2 dt2 − B 2 (dr2 + r2 dθ2 + r2 sin2 θdφ2 ),

(2)

where A and B are functions of r and t. Components of Einstein’s equation Rαβ − 12 gαβ R = 8πGTαβ , had been
reduced by Bergmann [1] employing a technique formulated by Glass [2], to the following single equation,

A′′ + 2

F ′ ′ F ′′
A −
A = 0.

(3)

In the above, prime denotes differentiation with respect to x = r2 , and F = B −1 . Clearly, one physically
relevant assumption is required in order to solve the above differential equation containing a pair of variables A
and F = B −1 . However, a physically meaningful assumption on the metric coefficients A and/ or B is obscure.
Bergmann [1] therefore obtained a simple solution under the choice A = 1 . In this paper, we opt for more general
solutions. It is important to mention that once the forms of A and B are known, it is quite trivial to compute
the radial component of heat flow, which is given by,

Generating solutions:

Case:1.

A′′ = 0 .

(4)

Under this choice, one obtains
A′ = Q(t);

and

A(x, t) = Q(t)x + P (t).

(5)

Thus equation (3) reads as,
2QF ′ − QxF ′′ − P F ′′ = 0.

(6)

Integrating the above equation and thereafter dividing throughout by (Qx + P )4 , one obtains

Further integration yields,

F =

and thus,

(9)

where, h, Q, P, , L are all functions of time. Equations (5) and (9) may be used to find explicit form of of the
radial component of heat flow q , in view of the expression (4).
A′′ 6= 0 .

Case:2.

Under this choice, F ′ 6= 0 , as may be seen from equation (3) and thus one can express A as,
A = A(F, t);

A′ = AF F ′ ;

A′′ = AF F F ′2 + AF F ′′ ,

(10)

where, suffix stands for derivative. So, equation (3) in this case reduces to
AF F + 2 AFF
dF ′
= 0.

Integrating the above equation one obtains,

or,

Integrating yet again one obtains,

dF = α(t)x + β(t).

(14)

Therefore, if A is given as a function of F and t, then the above integral can be evaluated and hence the solutions
may be obtained. Nevertheless, for a particular case, simple solutions may be obtained as follows.
Let us consider F ′′ = mF , where m is a function of time alone. So equation (3) may be written as,
F ′′
U ′′
=2
= ±k 2 , i.e., U ′′ = ±k 2 U
U
F

(15)

where, U = AF , and k is a function of time. Solutions of the above equation (16) may now be easily found as
given below,
U = C1 ekx + D1 e−kx ,

where, m is positive m = k 2 ,
where, m is negative m = −k 2 ,

U = C1 cos (kx) + D1 sin (kx),
U = qx + r,

where, m = 0.

(16)

Subcase-I: m = k 2 :
When m > 0 , equation (15) may be solved to obtain
F = C2 e

Now since, AF = U and B = F −1 , so

where, C1 , C2 , D1 , D2 and k are all functions of time. Solution (18) may be used to evaluate q from expression
(4).

When m < 0 , equation (15) may be solved to obtain

Subcase-III: m = 0 :
In this case k 2 = 0 , and so equation (15) may be solved to obtain,
F = k(t)x + C(t),

(21)

A=

Equation (23) may be used to find the expression for q from equation (3).

Conclusion:

Summarily, the present paper gives the complete set of cosmological solutions of Einstein’s equation with heat
flow which was reduced by Bergman to equation (3), either explicitly or implicitly. For A′′ = 0 , solutions have
been obtained explicitly and are presented in (5) and (9). For A′′ 6= 0 , on the contrary, solutions are given
implicitly by (14). However, some explicit solutions can be obtained for F ′′ = + 21 k 2 F as presented in equation
(18), F = − 12 k 2 F as in (20) and F ′′ = 0 , as revealed in equation (23).
It has already been stated that the solution of equation (3) gives the solution of Einstein’s equation for the
metric (2) and the energy-momentum tensor (1), where B = F −1 and q is the heat flow given by equation (4).
Having obtained these solutions, it remains to be shown that these are physically acceptable. Certain energy
conditions have to be satisfied, particularly that the energy density is positive everywhere.
