Abstract Calcium signalling is one of the most important mechanisms of information propagation in the body. In embryogenesis the interplay between
calcium signalling and mechanical forces is critical to the healthy development of an embryo but poorly understood. Several types of embryonic cells
exhibit calcium-induced contractions and many experiments indicate that calcium signals and contractions are coupled via a two-way mechanochemical
feedback mechanism. We present a new analysis of experimental data that
supports the existence of this coupling during Apical Constriction. We then
propose a simple mechanochemical model, building on early models that couple calcium dynamics to the cell mechanics and we replace the hypothetical
bistable calcium release with modern, experimentally validated calcium dynamics. We assume that the cell is a linear, viscoelastic material and we model
the calcium-induced contraction stress with a Hill function, i.e. saturating at
high calcium levels. We also express, for the first time, the “stretch-activation”
calcium flux in the early mechanochemical models as a bottom-up contribution from stretch-sensitive calcium channels on the cell membrane. We reduce

the model to three ordinary differential equations and analyse its bifurcation
structure semi-analytically as two bifurcation parameters vary - the IP3 concentration, and the “strength” of stretch activation, λ. The calcium system
(λ = 0, no mechanics) exhibits relaxation oscillations for a certain range of
IP3 values. As λ is increased the range of IP3 values decreases and oscillations eventually vanish at a sufficiently high value of λ. This result agrees with
experimental evidence in embryonic cells which also links the loss of calcium
oscillations to embryo abnormalities. Furthermore, as λ is increased the oscillation amplitude decreases but the frequency increases. Finally, we also identify
the parameter range for oscillations as the mechanical responsiveness factor of
the cytosol increases. This work addresses a very important and understudied
question regarding the coupling between chemical and mechanical signalling
in embryogenesis.

1 Introduction
Calcium signalling is one of the most important mechanisms of information
propagation in the body, playing an important role as a second messenger in
several processes such as embryogenesis, heart function, blood clotting, muscle contraction and diseases of the muscular and nervous systems [6, 7, 17].
Through the sensing mechanisms of cells, external environmental stimuli are
transformed into intracellular or intercellular calcium signals that often take
the form of oscillations and waves.
In this work we will focus on the interplay of calcium signalling and mechanical forces in embryogenesis. During embryogenesis, cells and tissues generate
physical forces, change their shape, move and proliferate [33]. The impact of
these forces on morphogenesis is directly linked to calcium signalling [25]. In
general, how the mechanics of the cell and tissue are regulated and coupled to
the cellular biochemical responseto is essential for understanding embryogenesis. Understanding this mechanochemical coupling, in particular when calcium
signalling is involved, is also important for elucidating a wide range of other
body processes, such as wound healing [1, 24] and cancer [4].
Calcium plays a crucial role in every stage of embryonic development
starting with fast calcium waves during fertilization [15] to calcium waves
involved in convergent extension movements during gastrulation [74], to calcium transients regulating neural tube closure [13], morphological patterning
in the brain [50, 76] and apical-basal cell thinning in the enveloping layer
cells [83], either in the form of calcium waves or through Wnt/Ca2+ signalling

[13, 24, 25, 29, 30, 42, 58, 59, 67, 74]. Crucially, pharmacologically inhibiting
calcium has been shown to lead to embryo defects [13, 60, 74].
In many experiments actomyosin-based contractions have been documented
in response to calcium release in both embryonic and cultured cells [13, 24,
25, 67, 74] and it has become clear that calcium is responsible for contractions
in both muscle and non-muscle cells, albeit through different mechanisms [14].
Cell contraction in striated muscle is mediated by the binding of Ca2+ to troponin but in non-muscle cells (and in smooth muscle cells) contraction is mediated by phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain of myosin. This phosphorylation promotes the assembly of myosin into filaments, and it increases
myosin activity. Myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK), which is responsible for
this phosphorylation, is itself regulated by calmodulin, a well-characterized
and ubiquitously expressed protein regulated by calcium [56]. Elevated cytosolic calcium promotes binding of calmodulin to MLCK, resulting in its
activation, subsequent phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain
and then contraction. Thus, cytosolic calcium elevation is an ubiquitous signal
for cell contraction which manifests in various ways [14].
In some tissues these contractions give rise to well defined changes in cell
shape. One such example is Apical Constriction (AC), an intensively studied
morphogenetic process central to embryonic development in both vertebrates
and invertebrates [72]. In AC the apical surface of an epithelial cell constricts,
leading to dramatic changes in cell shape. Such shape changes drive epithelial
sheet bending and invagination and are indispensable for tissue and organ morphogenesis including gastrulation in C. elegans and Drosophila and vertebrate
neural tube formation [13, 48, 55]. .
On the other hand, the ability of cells to sense and respond to forces by
elevating their cytosolic calcium is well established. Mechanically stimulated
calcium waves have been observed propagating through ciliated tracheal epithelial cells [51, 52, 53], rat brain glial cells [10, 11, 12], keratinocytes [70],
developing epithelial cells in Drosophila wing discs [42] and many other cell
types [5, 70, 78, 81]. Thus, different types of mechanical stimuli, from shear
stress to direct mechanical stimulation, can elicit calcium elevation (although
the sensing mechanism may differ in each case). So, since mechanical stimulation elicits calcium release and calcium elicits contractions which are sensed
as mechanical stimuli by the cell, it is clear that a two-way mechanochemical
feedback between calcium and contractions should be at play.
This two-way feedback is supported by our work here with a new analysis of
data from earlier experiments conducted by two of the authors [13]; we present
this analysis in detail in Section 2. The analysis shows that in contracting cells,
in the Xenopus neural plate, calcium oscillations become more frequent and
also increase in amplitude as the calcium-elicited surface area reduction progresses. This suggests that the increased tension around the contracting cell is
sensed, it leads to more calcium release and in turn to more contractions, and
so on. In addition, experiments in Drosophila also support the hypothesis that
a mechanohemicall feedback loop is in play [54, 64]. Thus, data from these
two model systems clearly show that mechanical forces generated by contrac-

tion influence calcium release and the contraction cycle. The mechanosensing
takes place via, as yet undefined, mechanosensory molecules which could be
mechanogated ion channels, mechanosensitive proteins at adherens junctions
like alpha catenin, or even integrins which have recently been shown to become
activated by plasma membrane tension in the absence of ligands [16, 45, 79].
Given the broad range of critical biological processes involving calcium signaling and its coupling to mechanical effects, modelling this mechanochemical
coupling is of great interest. Therefore, we develop a simple mechanochemical
model that captures the essential elements of a two-way coupling between calcium signalling and contractions in embryonic cells. The first mechanochemical
models for embryogenesis were developed by Oster, Murray and collaborators in the 80s [39, 40, 41, 44]. Calcium evolution in those early models was
modelled with a hypothetical bistable reaction-diffusion process in which the
application of stress can switch the calcium state from low to high stable concentration. We now know that the calcium dynamics are more complicated,
and, so, our mechanochemical model includes instead the calcium dynamics
of the experimentally verified model in [3], which captures the experimentally
observed Calcium-Induced-Calcium Release process and the dynamics of the
IP3 receptors on the ER. this way we update the early mechanochemical models for embryonic cells in line with recent advances in calcium signalling. Note
that there are many recent models of calcium signalling induced by mechanical stimulation, for example for mammalian airway epithelial cells [75], for
keratinocytes [27], for white blood cells [80], and for retinal pigment epithelial
cells [71]. However, these models do not include a two-way coupling between
calcium signalling and mechanics.
Calcium is stored and released from intracellular stores, such as the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), or the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum (SR), according to
the well-established nonlinear feedback mechanism of Calcium Induced Calcium Release (CICR)[17]. There are many models for calcium oscillations, all
capturing the CICR process. Many of them model the IP3 receptors on the ER
in some manner, and they can be classified as Class I or Class II models [17]. In
all Class I models IP3 is a control parameter and oscillations can be sustained
at a constant IP3 concentration. Oscillations exist for a window of IP3 values;
the oscillations are excited at a threshold IP3 value and they vanish at a suffuciently high IP3 value. The Atri et al. model in [3] is an established Class I
model, validated with experimental findings [19]. (We will call this model the
‘Atri model’ from now on.) It also has a mathematical structure that allows
us to analyse our mechanochemical model semi-analytically and easily identify
the parameter range sustaining calcium oscillations. Such an analysis cannot
be done for other qualitatively similar, minimal Class I models as, for example,
the more frequently used Li-Rinzel model [34]; this is one of the contributions
of this work.
Another contribution of our work is that we interpret the “stretch-activation”
calcium flux from the outside medium, introduced in an ad hoc manner in
the early mechanochemical models, as a “bottom-up” contribution from recently identified, stretch sensitive (stretch-activated) calcium channels (SS-

Calcium-Kaouri

CCs) [2, 17, 22, 38], in this way linking the channel scale with the whole cell
scale.
The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we present a new analysis
of experimental data which shows that calcium and contractions in embryonic
cells must be involved in a two-way mechanochemical feedback mechanism. In
Section 3 we develop a new mechanochemical model which captures the key
ingredients of the two-way coupling. In Section 4 we analyse the model. In
Section 4.1 we briefly revisit the analysis of the Atri model [3] and show the
bifurcation diagrams for the amplitude and frequency of calcium oscillations.
In Section 4.2 we perform the bifurcation analysis of the mechanochemical
model, varying the IP3 concentration and the strength of stretch activation,
and we identify the parameter range sustaining calcium oscillations. In Section 5.1 we model the calcium-induced contraction stress with a Hill function
of order 1, and we plot the parameter range for which oscillations are sustained. In Section 5.1.2 we study the amplitude and frequency of the calcium
oscillations. In Section 5.1.3 we investigate the bifurcation diagrams as the
mechanical responsiveness of the cytosol to calcium varies. In Section 5.2 we
consider a Hill function of order 2 and we again identify the parameter range
for oscillations. In Section 6 we summarise our conclusions and discuss further
research directions.

2 Calcium and contractions are involved in a feedback loop in
Apical Constriction: a new analysis of experimental data
There is ample experimental evidence that mechanical stimulation of cells
leads to calcium elevation [5, 11, 42, 51, 52, 53, 70, 81] and that, in turn,
contraction of the cytosol is elicited by calcium [13, 24, 25, 67, 74]. Calcium
signaling would therefore, at least in part, be regulated by a mechanochemical
feedback loop whereby calcium-elicited contractions mechanically stimulate
the cell, lead to more calcium release, then to more contractions and so on. In
embryogenesis, and in particular during Apical Constriction (AC), where cells
contract significantly, such a feedback loop should also be at play [37]; in this
work we present a new analysis of experimental data in [13] which supports
this. AC is a calcium-driven morphogenetic movement of epithelial tissues,
central in the embryogenesis of both vertebrates and invertebrates [72]. The
apical domain of epithelial cells constricts the apical surface area, contracting,
and this leads to changes in the cell geometry that drive tissue bending; in
[13] the formation of the neural tube in Xenopus frogs is studied and in [64]
dorsal closure in Drosophila.
In [64] the constriction of mutants that exhibit disrupted myosin activation rescues apical myosin accumulation, suggesting that mechanically stimulating the cell can elicit contractions [47]. In addition, experiments using laser
ablation, and other methodologies that reduce cell contractility, reveal that
mechanical feedback non-autonomously regulates the amplitude and spatial
propagation of pulsed contraction during AC [54] and that this process is

6

driven by calcium [25, 47, 54]. Therefore, reducing contractility reduces local
tension and this suppresses contraction in the control cells. This suggests that
mechanical feedback is important during AC.
Moreover, experimental evidence suggests that sensing of mechanical stimuli involves mechanogated ion channels; in Drosophila such ion channels are
required for embryos to regulate force generation after laser ablation [25]; similarly during wound healing [1].
Previously, two of the co-authors have shown that cell-autonomous, asynchronous calcium transients elicit contraction pulses, leading to the pulsed
reduction of the apical surface area of individual neural epithelial cells during
Neural Tube Closure (NTC) in Xenopus [13]. Here, in order to investigate in
detail the relationship between calcium, contraction and mechanical forces we
present a new analysis of previously collected data [13]. For a single embryonic
epithelial cell (in a tissue), we plot its apical surface area and calcium level
over time in Figure 1 and we see that both oscillate, with approximately the
same frequency and that the calcium pulse precedes the contraction by 30-40
seconds. (Note that calcium oscillations emerge spontaneously without any
periodic external stimulation.) More information about how Figure 1 is produced is found in Appendix A.1. In Figure 2a we plot the frequency of calcium

Fig. 1: Normalised apical surface area and amplitude of calcium oscillations
in a single cell undergoing Apical Constriction. We see that calcium elevation
always precedes the initiation of a contraction pulse. At t = 0 calcium begins
to rise and at t ≈ 50 sec the surface area starts decreasing. The surface area
reduction is succeeded by relaxation and stabilization of the cell at a smaller
surface area. (This happens repeatedly, leading to significant reduction of the
surface area over time.) See Appendix A.1 for further details on how the Figure

transients and the apical surface area over time, averaged over 10 cells. The

Calcium-Kaouri

frequency of calcium oscillations is clearly correlated with the reduction in the
surface area - cells with a smaller surface area exhibit more frequent calcium
oscillations. Also, in Figure 2b, for the same 10 cells and in the same timeframe, we plot the calcium oscillation amplitude, which increases with time.
Therefore, the reduction in the surface area correlates also to an increase in
the amplitude of the calcium oscillations. Therefore, increased surface area
reduction (i.e. increased tension and hence increased mechanical stimulation)
correlates with increased frequency and increased amplitude, i.e. overall increased calcium release.
Summarising, our analysis shows that calcium oscillations trigger contraction pulses that lead to pulsed reduction in the apical surface area over time. It
also shows that the increasing localized tension in a contracting cell correlates
with calcium pulses of higher frequency and larger amplitude, confirming the
presence of a mechanochemical feedback loop.

3 A new mechanochemical model for embryonic epithelial cells
We develop a simple mechanochemical model that captures the essential components of a two-way coupling of contractions and calcium signals in embryonic epithelial cells undergoing AC. Since the cell machinery involved in the
mechanochemical coupling is similar in most cell types [14] our model, with
some modifications, can also be applicable to other cell types. The essential
features of our model are a component modelling the cell mechanics and a
component modelling calcium dynamics, coupled through a two-way feedback.
Such models have been proposed by Oster, Murray and collaborators in the
80s [39, 40, 41, 44] and here we update those models by replacing the hypothetical bistable calcium dynamics with the experimentally verified calcium
dynamics in [3]. We also replace the ad hoc stretch activation calcium flux in
[39] with a “bottom-up” calcium release through the SSCCs, thus linking the
channels’ characteristics to the whole cell scale. The model takes the form

each cell was measured at t = 0 and the average calcium oscillation frequency
was calculated using a 10-minute window (i.e. calcium oscillations for each
cell were monitored between t = 0 and t = 10 minutes). A 10-minute window
was selected so that the typical cell undergoes at least one calcium pulse. (See
Appendix A.1 for further details.)

IP3 and is an increasing function of p, the IP3 concentration. The constant
kf denotes the calcium flux when all IP3 receptors are open and activated,
and b represents a basal current through the IP3 channel. Jpump represents
the calcium flux pumped out of the cytosol where γ is the maximum rate of
pumping of calcium from the cytosol and kγ is the calcium concentration at
which the rate of pumping from the cytosol is at half-maximum. Jleak models
the calcium flux leaking into the cytosol from outside the cell. Note that from

Calcium-Kaouri

9

now on we will neglect Jleak as this is a good approximation for the embryonic
epithelial cells we consider.
JSSCC is the calcium flux due to the activated SSCCs. SSCCs have been
identified experimentally in recent years - they are on the cell membrane and
allow calcium to flow into the cytosol from the extracellular space. They are
activated when exposed to mechanical stimulation and they close either by
relaxation of the mechanical force or by adaptation to the mechanical force
[2, 17, 22, 38]. The constant S represents the ‘strength’ of stretch activation. In
Section 3.1 we will derive a relationship for S as a function of the characteristics
of a SSCC.
The inactivation of the IP3 receptors by calcium acts on a slower timescale
compared to activation [17] and so the time constant for the dynamics of h,
τh > 1 in ODE (2). In ODE (3) TD (c) is a contraction stress that expresses
how the stress in the cell depends on the cytosolic calcium level. The constants
ξ1 , ξ2 are, respectively, the shear and bulk viscosities of the cytosol and the
constants E 0 = E/(1+ν) and ν 0 = ν/(1−2ν), where E and ν are, respectively,
the Young’s modulus and the Poisson ratio.
Our mechanochemical model is also an extension of the Atri model,

since ODE (1) is ODE (4) but with JSSCC added to the right hand side as an
extra source term. The detailed derivation of the Atri model is presented in
[3], where it was initially formulated, and the reader is referred there for more
details. The parameter values, which we take from [3], are summarised in the
Appendix, Table 1. The Atri model is one of the minimal Class I models, in
which relaxation oscillations can be sustained at constant IP3 concentration
[17, 26]. It was developed as a model for intracellular calcium oscillations in
Xenopus oocytes but it has been subsequently used to model calcium dynamics
in other cell types including glial cells [77], mammalian spermatozoa [43], and
keratinocytes [27, 28]. In addition, modified Atri models have been developed
in [23, 35, 57]. In [19] the Atri model was compared to seven other calcium
dynamics models and it exhibited the best agreement with experiments along
with the more frequently used Li-Rinzel model [34]. Also, the Atri model has
a mathematical structure that allows us to perform a large part of our study
analytically. The Atri system is also mathematically interesting because its
relaxation oscillations have a different asymptotic structure to that of the wellknown Van der Pol oscillator and similar excitable systems. We will present
an asymptotic analysis of the Atri model and of our mechanochemical model
in future work.
Now, we describe our modelling assumptions and the remaining components of the model in more detail.

3.1 Stretch-activation calcium flux
In the early mechanochemical models [39] the stretch-activation flux Sθ was
introduced in a somewhat ad hoc manner. Here, we derive it in a bottom-up
manner, from the contribution of the SSCCs to the cytosolic calcium concentration.
A model for the opening and closing of SSCCs was developed in [71] for
retinal pigment epithelial cells; we adapt it here for embryonic epithelial cells
for which no such modelling has been performed. We denote by CSSCC the
proportion of channels in the closed state, and by OSSCC the proportion of
SSCCs in the open state. The calcium flux due to the SSCCs is proportional
to the number of open channels so JSSCC = KSSCC OSSCC , where KSSCC is the
maximum calcium flux rate going through the SSCCs. As in [71], we propose
that the evolution of OSSCC is governed by the ODE
d(OSSCC )
= kF θ − (kF θ + kB )OSSCC ,
dt

(6)

where kF is the forward rate constant and kB is the backward rate constant.
We assume here that OSSCC is quasi-steady, i.e. OSSCC remains approximately
constant as calcium rapidly evolves. This is a reasonable approximation, as
discussed in Section 2.6 of [17]. Therefore,
OSSCC ≈

kF θ
.
kF θ + kB

(7)

We linearise (7) since θ is small for a linear viscoelastic medium and under the
F
is of order 1 at most. We obtain
additional assumption that kkB
OSSCC ≈

θ =⇒ JSSCC = KSSCC θ =⇒ S = KSSCC .

(8)

Therefore, we have derived, for the first time, an expression for S as a combination of KSSCC , kF and kB , linking in this way the characteristics of an
SSCC to the macroscopic stretch-activation calcium flux.

3.2 Derivation of ODE (3)
We can obtain ODE (3) from the full force balance mechanical equation for
a linear viscoelastic material. Linear viscoelasticity, at first glance, might not
be an appropriate approximation for embryogenic tissue undergoing drastic
changes but recent experiments [73] show it is reasonable. For a Kelvin-Voigt,
linear viscoelastic material sustaining calcium-induced contractions the force
balance equation can be written as follows [32, 39]:

where σ is the stress tensor, e = 12 (∇u + ∇uT ) is the strain tensor, u the
displacement vector, θ = ∇.u is the dilation/compression of the material, and
I is the unit tensor. TD (c) is the contraction stress which depends on the
cytosolic calcium [56]. In one spatial dimension e = e = θ = ∂u
∂x and therefore
(9) becomes, upon integrating with respect to x,
(ξ1 + ξ2 )θt + E 0 (1 + ν 0 )θ − TD (c)) = A.

(10)

The constant of integration A = 0 since when c = 0, TD = 0 , θ = 0 and
θt = 0. Hence, we obtain ODE (3).

is between 0.36 and 0.75. For simplicity, and since the parameter values for

In Appendix A.2 we carry out a linear stability analysis of (14)–(15) and a
bifurcation analysis with µ as the bifurcation parameter and we find that the
parameter range for relaxation oscillations (limit cycles) is 0.289 ≤ µ ≤ 0.495,
as in [3]. In Appendix A.2 more details on the bifurcation structure of the
system are given.
In Figure 3 we plot the bifurcation diagrams for the Atri system. In Figure
3a we present the amplitude of oscillations. The left Hopf point (LHP) and the
right Hopf point (RHP) are, respectively, at µ = 0.289 and µ = 0.495. There
are stable limit cycles and unstable limit cycles. The amplitude of oscillations
increases with µ except for a small range of µ values near the RHP. In Figure
3b the frequency of the stable and of the unstable limit cycles are shown,
respectively. The range of µ for which both a stable and an unstable limit
cycle are sustained is clearly visible as the double-valued part of the curve. The
limit point of oscillations at µ = 0.511, where the stable and unstable limit
cycle branches coalesce, is also visible. The frequency of the stable limit cycles
increases slowly as µ increases and the lower, stable branch approximates the
square root of µ, as predicted by bifurcation theory [31].

To identify the µ-λ parameter range sustaining oscillations we seek the Hopf

Hence, we can easily obtain the Hopf curve, for any T̂ (c) by parametrically
plotting (21) and (22), with c as a parameter. The interior of the Hopf curve
corresponds to an unstable spiral and approximates the µ-λ parameter space
sustaining oscillations (limit cycles) in the full nonlinear system.
We also determine parametric expressions for the fold curve. Inside the fold
curve there are three steady states, on the fold curve two of states coalesce,
and outside the fold curve there is one steady state. Setting Det(M2 ) = 0

Equations (23) and (16) constitute a linear system for µ and λ, so we again
easily derive parametric expressions for µ(c) and λ(c).
Similarly, to determine parametric expressions for the curve on which

(24)

which is quadratic in µ and linear in λ. Combining (24) with (16) we can
again determine parametric expressions for µ and λ. In summary, we have
developed a quick method for determining the three key curves characterising
the geometry of the bifurcation diagram, for any T̂ (c).
It is of course, a fortunate accident of construction that we can obtain
these analytical expressions for this particular model. Since our model is qualitatively similar to any other mechanochemical model that is based on Class I
calcium models, the analytical progress we make here is very useful since the
insights gained from it can be applied to other mechanochemical models. A
different model would have a more complex set of linear stability equations,
that look quite different, but that are fundamentally saying the exact same
thing. Crucial to the behaviour is the shape of the manifolds rather than the
detail of the algebraic expressions.

is for λ = 0 and the dashed curve is for λ = 4. (Plot done with Mathematica.)

assuming that when the calcium level increases sufficiently the stress saturates
to a constant value, Ts = 1. This is a reasonable assumption since the cells
reach a point at which they stop responding mechanically to calcium since the
molecules involved in contraction, calmodulin and myosin light chain kinases,
saturate for sufficiently high calcium levels [65]. Also, T̂ = 0 when c = 0,
i.e. we assume no contraction stress without calcium. T̂ 0 (0) = α is the rate
of increase of T̂ at c = 0 and 1/α is the scale of ‘ascent’ to the saturation
level Ts . Therefore, we can call α the ‘mechanical responsiveness factor’ of the
cytoskeleton to calcium.
Choosing T̂ (c) = 10c/(1 + 10c) as an illustrative example, in Figure 4 we
use (16) to plot the steady state as a function of µ, for selected increasing
values of λ (equilibrium curve). For λ < 4 the equlibrium curve is qualitatively
similar to that of the Atri model (see Figure 3a) but at λ = 4 the curve changes
qualitatively and a second non-zero steady state exists for 4 < λ < 40/7, and
a part of the curve corresponds to negative values of µ (see Appendix A.3 for
details). For λ > 40/7 no steady state exists for positive µ and hence λ ≤ 40/7
is the biologically relevant range of the model, for α = 10 (see Appendix A.3).
In Figure 5 we plot the Hopf curve and the fold curve. We observe the
following: (i) for λ = 0 we recover the Hopf points and the fold points of
the Atri model, as expected. (ii) As λ increases the range of µ that sustains
oscillations decreases. There is a global minimum value of µ that can sustain
oscillations, µmin . (iii) The oscillations are suppressed for a critical maximum

value of λ, λmax and the system is in a high calcium state. Overall, we conclude
the following from the Hopf curve:
– for low IP3 values the Atri system does not sustain oscillations but there
are two possibilities for the mechanochemical model as λ increases:
• for µ < µmin no increase in λ will ever elicit oscillations.
• for 0.203 = µmin < µ < 0.289 when λ reaches a certain value, λOSC ,
oscillations are elicited, and λOSC decreases as µ approaches 0.289. The
oscillations vanish at a larger value of λ.
– for IP3 values for which the Atri system sustains oscillations (0.289 < µ <
0.495) in the mechanochemical model oscillations eventually vanish at a
critical λ. This critical λ decreases monotonically as µ increases towards
0.495.
– for high IP3 values (µ ≥ 0.495) no oscillations are sustained in the Atri
system and a further increase in λ will never elicit oscillations.
Therefore, for fixed cytoskeletal mechanical responsiveness factor, α = 10,
and for fixed parameter values as in [3] a range of behaviours emerge as µ
and λ vary: at low IP3 levels that do not elicit oscillations in the Atri system
mechanical effects can elicit oscillations, for intermediate IP3 levels that do
sustain oscillations in the Atri system increasing mechanical effects always
leads to the oscillations vanishing, and for high IP3 levels that cannot sustain
oscillations in the Atri system no amount of stretch activation can ever elicit
oscillations.
Overall, we conclude that in this case the effect of mechanics can significantly affect calcium signalling. A very important prediction of the model is
that oscillations vanish for sufficiently large stretch activation. This prediction agrees with the experiments reported in [13] (Figure 5D); when the cells
were forced to enter a high, non-oscillatory calcium state they monotonically
reduced their apical surface area without oscillations. Interestingly, although
the loss of oscillations did not affect the reduction of the apical surface on
average, it led to the disruption of the patterning involved in AC and neural
tube closure failed, leading to severe embryo abnormality.
In fact, the model also agrees, qualitatively, with other experimental observations. Intracellular calcium levels (which are regulated by IP3 ) directly affect
cell contractility [13]. At low levels of IP3 and hence low levels of calcium, cells
are not able to contract and therefore apical constriction does not take place.
At a threshold IP3 value the system changes behaviour and calcium oscillations/transients appear (mathematically this corresponds to a bifurcation).
The calcium oscillations enable the ratchet-like pulsating process of the AC
to progress normally. At high levels of IP3 the cell has been shown to enter a
high-calcium state with no oscillations, as mentioned above. (This corresponds
to another bifurcation since the system changes its qualitative behaviour.)
Regarding bistability, note that the fold curve consists of two branches very
close to each other since the Atri system is bistable for a very small range of
IP3 concentrations. As λ increases this range decreases and eventually vanishes
at λ ≈ 0.83, where the two fold curve branches merge.

λ, λmax = 1.686 and to the minimum value of µ, µmin = 0.203 for which

Summarising, the parametric method we have developed allows us to easily
plot the Hopf curve, and the two other important curves of the bifurcation
diagram, for any functional form of T̂ (c) we may choose, and thus examine
quickly the effect of mechanics on calcium oscillations. We note that in the
experiments of [13] the calcium-induced stress saturates to a non-zero level as
calcium levels increase and hence we chose a T̂ (c) that saturates. In other cell
types it is possible that the cell can relax back to baseline stress and in such
a case T̂ (c) would not be described by a Hill function, and more experiments
should be undertaken to determine the appropriate form of T̂ (c).

5.1.2 Amplitude and frequency of the calcium oscillations
We now determine numerically the amplitude and frequency of oscillations
(limit cycles) of the system (11)–(12) when T̂ (c) = 10c/(1 + 10c).
In Figure 6 we plot the oscillation amplitude as a function of λ, for two
selected values of µ, using XPPAUT. For µ = 0.25 (Figure 6a) the Atri system
has no oscillations but stable limit cycles arise in the mechanochemical model
as λ is increased, which agrees with the Hopf curve in Figure 5. For µ =
0.3 (Figure 6b) the Atri system has a stable limit cycle and as λ increases,
stable and unstable limit cycles emerge for a finite λ-interval, and oscillations
eventually vanish for sufficiently large λ. For µ = 0.4 the Atri system has a
stable limit cycle and as λ increases, stable and unstable limit cycles emerge
for a finite range of λ values, and oscillations eventually vanish for a large
enough value of λ.
The oscillation amplitude changes slowly with λ for a fixed µ, that is the
oscillation amplitude is robust to changes in stretch activation.
In Figure 7 we plot the oscillation amplitude as a function of µ, for three
selected values of λ, using XPPAUT. We see that as λ increases the amplitude
decreases until the oscillations vanish close to λ = λmax = 1.69, which agrees
with the Hopf curve in Figure 5. We also observe that for λ = 0.5 and 1, in
Figures 7a and 7b respectively, there are both stable and unstable limit cycles,
and the right Hopf point is subcritical. Also, as λ increases, the µ-range of
unstable limit cycles decreases until it vanishes; for λ = 1.5 (Figure 7c) there
are only stable limit cycles, and the right Hopf point has become supercritical.
We see that as in the Atri model, the oscillation amplitude changes quite
rapidly with µ in the mechanochemical system.
In Figure 8 we plot the frequency of the limit cycles as µ increases, for three
values of λ, using XPPAUT. For λ = 0.5 and λ = 1, the frequency increases
rapidly close to the LHP and the RHP and there is an ‘intermediate’ region
where the frequency varies slowly with µ, as in the Atri system (see Figure
3). The ‘intermediate’ region becomes smaller as λ increases, and for λ = 1.5
this region vanishes. We see that as λ increases the frequency of oscillations
decreases overall.

Summarising, for any value of µ and λ we can determine the range for oscillations using the parametric expressions (21) and (22), and then use XPPAUT
[18] or other continuation software to obtain their amplitude and frequency.
In Figure 9 we plot the evolution of c(t), solving (11)–(12) numerically, for
µ = 0.3 and selected values of λ; as expected from the bifurcation diagrams,
the oscillations are suppressed when λ is sufficiently increased.
5.1.3 Varying the cytosolic mechanical responsiveness factor
We now investigate if the Hopf curve changes qualitatively as the cytosol’s
mechanical responsiveness factor, α, varies. In Figure 10a, using the para-

metric expressions (21)–(22) we plot the Hopf curves for increasing values of
α = 1, 2, 10, 100. We observe that the Hopf curve changes qualitatively; for
α ≈ 2 it develops a cusp and for smaller values of α there is a “bow-tie”.
This geometrical change corresponds to yet another bifurcation, with α as a
bifurcation parameter1 . However, as for α = 10, oscillations always vanish for
a sufficiently large value of λ, λmax .
We also observe that as α increases, λmax , the critical stretch activation
value beyond which oscillations vanishes, decreases, i.e. oscillations are sustained for a smaller range of λ values. To investigate this more systematically
we have determined parametric expressions for λmax and α as functions of c,
and we plot λmax (α) in Figure 10b. We see that as α increases, λmax decreases
monotonically, and hence oscillations are sustained for an increasingly smaller
range of λ, which agrees with Figure 10a. Also, since λmax (α) asymptotes to a
αc
positive value as α → ∞, for any T̂ (c) = 1+αc
, the system will always sustain
some oscillations, irrespectively of the value of α. Therefore, we predict that
for cytosols that are more responsive to calcium (higher α), oscillations vanish
at a lower λmax .To test this experimentally the responsiveness of the cytosol to
calcium should be manipulated whilst monitoring whether oscillations appear.
The contractility of the cytosol could be manipulated by inhibiting Myosin II
contractility using the ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632).
1 The cusped Hopf curve is the bifurcation curve of a cusp catastrophe surface, according
to the catastrophe theory developed by Zeeman [82], and subsequently by Stewart and
collaborators [46, 66].

However, since (21) does not depend on T̂ (c), µmin is constant and not
zero for any α. Therefore, as we expect, IP3 is always required in order to
obtain oscillations, for any λ and any α but the minimum level of IP3 does
not change with α. Also, for fixed λ, as α, the mechanical responsiveness
factor of the cytosol, increases, the IP3 level required to induce oscillations
also decreases. Additionally, for fixed µ, as α increases λmax reduces.
Summarising, we conclude that as the cytosol’s mechanical responsiveness
increases a lower level of stretch activation is sufficient to sustain oscillations.
Also, there will always be oscillations for some values of µ and λ when the
contraction stress is modelled as a Hill function of order 1.

5.2 Hopf curves for T̂ (c) a Hill function of order 2
It is instructive to investigate whether a different functional form of T̂ will
change our conclusions. We thus model T̂ (c) as a Hill function of order 2,
αc2
T̂ (c) = 1+αc
2 , which models a cytosol which is less sensitive to calcium for
αc
low calcium levels than T̂ (c) = 1+αc
but which saturates faster. In Figure 11
we plot the Hopf curves of the system (11)–(13) for increasing α, the cytosolic
mechanical responsiveness factor, using again the parametric expressions (21)–
(22). Comparing Figure 11 with Figure 10a we see that the Hopf curves have
the same qualitative behaviour for the two Hill functions. Oscillations can be
sustained for any value of α and they always vanish for a sufficiently large value
of λ, Also, as in the Hill function of order 1 as α increases λmax decreases while
µmin is constant. Also, a cusp again develops but for the Hill function of order
2 the value of α where this occurs increases. We conclude that the conclusions
are robust to the change of the Hill function. In future work Hill functions of
higher order or other functional forms of T can be investigated.

6 Summary, conclusions and future research directions
A wealth of experimental evidence has accumulated which shows that many
types of cells release calcium in response to mechanical stimuli but also that
calcium release causes cells to contract. Therefore, studying this mechanochemical coupling is important for elucidating a wide range of body processes and
diseases. In this work we have focused attention on embryogenesis, where the
interplay of calcium and mechanics is shown to be essential in Apical Constriction (AC), an essential morphogenetic process which, if disrupted, leads
to embryo abnormalities [13].
We have presented a new analysis of experimental data that supports the
existence of a two-way mechanochemical coupling between calcium signalling
and contractions in embryonic epithelial cells involved in Apical Constriction.
We have then developed a simple mechanochemical ODE model that consists of an ODE for θ, the cell apical dilation, derived consistently from a
full, linear viscoelastic ansatz for a Kelvin-Voigt material, and two ODEs governing, respectively, the evolution of calcium and the proportion of active
IP3 receptors. The two latter ODEs are based on the well-known, experimentally verified, Atri model for calcium dynamics [3]. An important feature
of our model is the two-way coupling between calcium and mechanics which
was proposed for the first time in models by Oster, Murray and collaborators
[39, 40, 41, 44]. However, in those models hypothetical bistable calcium dynamics were considered whereas here we have updated those models with recent
advances in calcium signalling, as encapsulated by the Atri model. We have
also modelled the calcium-dependent contraction stress in the cytosol as a Hill
function T̂ (c), since experiments indicate that the mechanical responsiveness
of the cytosol to calcium saturates for high calcium levels.
The early mechanochemical models included an ad hoc stretch activation
calcium flux, λθ, in the calcium ODE. Here, we have also derived, for the
first time, this “stretch-activation” flux as a “bottom-up” contribution from
stretch sensitive calcium channels (SSCCs), thus expressing the parameter λ as
a combination of the structural characteristics of a SSC; λ can also be thought
of as a coupling parameter between calcium signalling and mechanics. Despite
an extensive literature search we could not find experimental measurements
for SSCCs; this could be a direction for future experiments.
For any T̂ (c), we have analytically identified the parameter regime in the
µ–λ plane corresponding to calcium oscillations and applied this result in
two illustrative examples, T̂ (c) = αc/(1 + αc) and T̂ (c) = αc2 /(1 + αc2 ).
In both cases, as λ increases, the oscillations are eventually suppressed at a
critical λ, λmax —see, respectively, Figures 10a and 11. The prediction is in
agreement with experiments [13] where a high, non-oscillatory calcium state
is associated with a very high stress in the cytosol and continuous contraction
(Figure 5D). This high-calcium, high-stress state is associated with failure
of Apical Constriction and consequently with defective tissue morphogenesis.
This makes sense since calcium oscillations are the ‘information carrier’ in
cells so we indeed expect that if they vanish the task at hand, in this case AC,

Calcium-Kaouri

will not be performed correctly. In summary, we have shown that there are
scenarios where mechanical effects significantly affect calcium signalling and
this is a key result of this work.
For T̂ (c) = αc/(1 + αc) we have also shown analytically that as α, the
mechanical responsiveness factor of the cytosol increases, λmax decreases but
it never becomes zero (see Figure 10b). This means that for any α, there will
always be a µ-λ region for which oscillations are sustained. Furthermore, for the
illustrative example of T̂ (c) = 10c/(1 + 10c) we have determined numerically
the oscillation amplitude and frequency as the bifurcation parameters µ and
λ vary, using XPPAUT. We found that the behaviour is qualitatively similar
to the Atri model (see Figure 3) for lower λ values but that it changes for
larger λ values (see Figure 6). We found that, as λ increases the amplitude of
oscillations decreases (see Figure 7) but their frequency decreases (see Figure
8). More experiments could be undertaken to test these predictions.
In the experiments of [13] the calcium-induced stress saturates to a nonzero level as calcium levels increase but in other cell types it is possible that
the cell can relax back to baseline stress and in such a case T̂ (c) cannot be
modelled as a Hill function. Experiments could be undertaken also in other
calcium-induced mechanical processes to determine the appropriate form of
T̂ (c) and the model could then be modified appropriately.
Another approximation we have made is that the mechanical properties
of the cell (Young’s modulus, Poisson ratio, viscosity) are constant. However,
their values can change significantly with space and also with embryo stage
[8, 36, 84]. One of the next steps in the modelling would be to take these
variations into account.
Due to the complexity of calcium signalling all models introduce approximations. One important approximation in this work is that we neglect stochastic effects, even though the opening and closing of IP3 receptors and of the SSCCs is a stochastic process. However, the deterministic models still have good
predictive power, whilst being more amenable to analytical calculations [9, 68].
A multitude of deterministic and stochastic calcium models have been developed [3, 20, 21, 61, 63, 69, 77]; see also the comprehensive reviews [49, 62, 68]
and the books [17, 26], among others. Future work could involve developing
stochastic mechanochemical models.
The interplay of mechanics and calcium signalling in non-excitable cells
is important in processes occurring not only in embryogenesis but also in
wound healing and cancer, amongst many others, and more efforts should
be devoted in developing appropriate mechanochemical calcium models that
would help elucidate the currently many open questions. In this connection, the
insights we have obtained from the simple model we have developed here are
a first step in this direction. We will aim to extend to models in more realistic
geometries. Moreover, we have fixed all parameters here, except µ, λ and α;
and the variation of other parameter values may lead to other bifurcations and
biologically relevant behaviours.
Finally, the newly discovered SSCCs merit much more experimental investigation and modelling; in this work we have adopted a simple model for their

about their opening and closing rates. In further experimental work, the parameter values associated with SSCCs should be measured and perhaps more
sophisticated models for SSCCs should be developed.

A Appendix
A.1 Supplementary information on the presented experimental results
Figure 1: Plot of surface area (measured in µm2 ) and calcium oscillation amplitude over
time of a single embryonic, epithelial cell undergoing Apical Constriction in Xenopus [13].
Measurements were taken every 10 seconds from a time lapse movie of a stage 9 Xenopus
embryo expressing Lulu-GFP + GECO-RED (see [13]). To normalise the surface area, all
the area values were divided by the first measured value (which is the largest since the surface area is decreasing with time). For measuring calcium oscillation amplitudes, the signal
intensity of the non-ratiometric calcium sensor (GECO-RED) was also measured over time.
For normalization, all values were divided by the highest signal intensity value. Note that we

34

tracked the surface area and calcium level of cells induced to undergo AC at gastrula stage
in order to decouple AC from other mophogenetic movements, like mediolateral junction
shrinkage and convergent extension, which take place in later embryogenic stages and which
would also influence the cell shape and surface area.
Figure 2: (a) Plot of surface area (µm2 ) and calcium oscillation frequency over time
from 10 neural plate cells of stage 16 Xenopus embryo using the mem-GFP +GECO RED
sensor molecule. The average surface area of each cell was evaluated for four time intervals;
0-10, 10-20, 20-30 and 30-40 minutes. For normalization for each cell, the average surface
area in each time period was divided by the average surface area of the first period (0-10
min) The calcium oscillation frequency in each cell was calculated by counting the number
of calcium oscillations, in each time interval. This value was then divided by 10 since there
are 10 minutes in each time interval. (b) Plot of average calcium oscillation amplitude of 10
neural plate cells (same cells as in (a)). The signal intensity of the non-ratiometric calcium
sensor (GECO-RED) was measured per calcium oscillation in each of the cells over time.
For normalization, the values were then divided by the highest intensity value. The average
value in each of the four time intervals was plotted.

which can be cast as a quartic in c. (Note that (16) reduces to (28) for λ = 0, as expected.)
In Figure 12 we plot the equilibrium curve (28) in order to visualise the number of steady
states and the corresponding value(s) of c, as µ is increased. The qualitative behaviour of
the solutions of the system can be determined by plotting the nullclines (26) and (27). When
the nullclines cross the system has a steady state, and when they touch the system has a
double (degenerate) steady state. Nullcline (26) passes through the origin of the (c,h) plane,
Γ

and setting dh/dc = 0, which leads to a quadratic equation for c. Rearranging, and since
c > 0, we discard the negative root, obtaining
p

(30)
cM (b, K) =

Fig. 12: The steady states of (14)-(15) as a function of the bifurcation parameter µ, as obtained using the analytical expression (28). As µ increases, from
small to large there is one steady state, a double (degenerate) steady state
at µ1 = 0.28814, then three steady states, then a double (degenerate) steady
state at µ2 = 0.28925, and for values of µ larger than 0.28925 one steady state.

Therefore, hM scales with Γ/(µK1 ) and depends on the parameters K and b in a much
more complicated manner. For the parameter values from [3] we have cM = 0.169 and
hM = 0.279/µ.
Nullcline (27) is a decreasing function of c; it has a maximum at (0,1) and tends to 0
as c → ∞. For µ1 = 0.28814 and µ2 = 0.28925 the nullclines touch and there is a double
steady state; for values of µ < µ1 and µ > µ2 there is one S.S. and there are three S.S.
for µ1 < µ < µ2 . (µ1 and µ2 are obtained by differentiating (28) and finding the roots
= 0.) Note that we present the values of µ with five decimal places because the
of dµ
dc
bifurcation analysis depends sensitively on µ, as we will see later.
We then linearise the system near the steady states. We determine the Trace (Tr),
Determinant (Det) and Discriminant (Discr) of the Jacobian of the system as follows

Discr = (Tr)2 − 4Det.
Taking the parameter values of [3] we identify the bifurcations of the system as µ increases by determining where the Tr, Det, and Discr change sign. We find a richer bifucation
structure as µ increases. This behaviour was not analysed in such detail in [3] or in later
literature. Given the very sensitive dependence on precise values of µ, these details are probably of more mathematical interest than of biological significance. The parameter values are
summarised in Table 1.
• 0 < µ < 0.27828: one stable node.
• µ = 0.27828: the stable node becomes a stable spiral (bifurcation Discr=0)
• µ = 0.28814: Stable spiral present. Also, a saddle and an unstable node (UN) emerge
(bifurcation Det=0, fold point)
• µ = 0.28900: the stable spiral becomes an unstable spiral. The other two S.S. are still a
saddle and an unstable node. (Tr=0, Hopf bifurcation)
• µ = 0.28924 the unstable spiral becomes an unstable node, and we have two unstable
nodes and a saddle (Discr=0)

From the regimes identified above we are particularly interested in the regime of relaxation
oscillations, since their amplitude and/or frequency encodes the information in calcium
signals. Relaxation oscillations are sustained for 0.28900 ≤ µ ≤ 0.49500 since at µ = 0.28900
a Hopf bifurcation (HB) arises, the stable spiral becomes unstable, and we expect relaxation
oscillations (limit cycles) in the nonlinear system. As µ increases the unstable spiral becomes
a stable spiral close to µ = 0.495000 and the limit cycles eventually vanish.

A.3 Linear stability analysis of the mechanochemical model with no IP3
Here we analyse the case µ = 0. Biologically, this corresponds to treating the cell with
thapsigargin so that all calcium is depleted from the ER and there is no flux from the ER.

Equation (34) is decoupled from equations (32) and (33), and we can thus continue with a

two-dimensional analysis for equations (32)–(33). The steady states satisfy λT̂ (c) =

Therefore, for any T̂ (c), Discr(M1 ) > 0, Tr(M1 ) < 0 always, and Det(M1 ) can be negative
or positive, the steady states can only be stable nodes or saddles, and oscillations cannot
be sustained. For some choices of T̂ a non-zero steady state may exist and this means
biologically that even without calcium flux from the ER a non-zero calcium concentration
can be sustained in the cytosol due to the stress-induced calcium release.
For T̂ (c) as given in (25), there is always a steady state (c? , θ? )=(0, 0). A second steady
state

We can easily show that the steady state (0,0) loses its stability and becomes a saddle
when the second stable S.S. emerges (as a stable node). This means that there is a range
of λ values for which the system sustains a non-zero calcium concentration even without a
CICR flux. For even larger values of λ there is no steady state and the model ceases to be
biologically relevant.
