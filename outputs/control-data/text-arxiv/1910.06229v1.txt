Nearly a 30% increase in the ferromagnetic phase transition temperature has been achieved in
strained MnAs nanocrystals embedded in a wurtzite GaAs matrix. Wurtzite GaAs exerts tensile
stress on hexagonal MnAs nanocrystals, preventing a hexagonal to orthorhombic structural phase
transition, which in bulk MnAs is combined with the magnetic one. This effect results in a
remarkable shift of the magneto-structural phase transition temperature from 313 K in the bulk
MnAs to above 400 K in the tensely strained MnAs nanocrystals. This finding is corroborated by the
state of the art transmission electron microscopy, sensitive magnetometry, and the first-principles
calculations. The effect relies on defining a nanotube geometry of molecular beam epitaxy grown
core−multishell wurtzite (Ga,In)As/(Ga,Al)As/(Ga,Mn)As/GaAs nanowires, where the MnAs
nanocrystals are formed during the thermal-treatment-induced phase separation of wurtzite
(Ga,Mn)As into the GaAs−MnAs granular system. Such a unique combination of two types of
hexagonal lattices provides a possibility of attaining quasi-hydrostatic tensile strain in MnAs
(impossible otherwise), leading to the substantial ferromagnetic phase transition temperature increase
in this compound.

INTRODUCTION
Various forms of strain manipulation including thermal effects, phase change, dislocations or
periodic lattice strain engineering have been shown to improve and modify physical properties of
functional materials.1,2 Importantly, the unprecedented progress in a spatial resolution of modern
characterization techniques as well as in the first principles methods efficiency have simultaneously
allowed a quantitative understanding of the mechanisms responsible for these modifications.2,3 The
hybrid structures comprising magnetic nanocrystals (NCs) embedded in semiconducting matrices,
constitute a range of materials with magnetic properties strongly dependent on the various forms of
strain.4,5 Such hybrid systems can offer functionalities similar to those expected from dilute
ferromagnetic semiconductors (DFS),6 but they enable overcoming the low ferromagnetic transition
temperature (TC) limit of DFS, known not to exceed 200 K.7 Therefore, since the very beginning of
the research activity devoted to DFS, phase segregated, hybrid materials consisting of magnetic NCs
embedded in a semiconductor host had been investigated.8 Such a composite material can be
fabricated the easy way, by a medium-to-high temperature (400 – 600 oC) post-growth annealing of
(Ga,Mn)As, the canonical DFS, resulting in the GaAs:MnAs hybrid system.9,10,11,12,13,14,15 Since the
equilibrium solubility of Mn in the GaAs host lattice is low (below about 0.2%),16 the (Ga,Mn)As
ternary compound can only be obtained by highly nonequilibrium methods such as low temperature
molecular beam epitaxy (MBE),7 or ion implantation.17,18,19 Due to the coexistence of
semiconducting and ferromagnetic properties, (Ga,Mn)As exhibits a wealth of interesting
magnetotransport properties. However, all the prospecting features of this class of materials can be
harnessed only at the cryogenic temperatures. This obstacle hampers employment of (Ga,Mn)As in
the application-ready devices and fuels ever so growing interest in the hybrid systems. Despite their
inferior electrical properties (e.g., conductivity) to those of (Ga,Mn)As (or other DFSs), they offer
much higher, technologically viable TC, which is usually considerably higher than the roomtemperature (e.g., MnSb microcrystals embedded in GaSb,20 or ε-Fe3N NCs embedded in GaN,21
both with TC in the vicinity of 300 oC).
Here, we investigate the formation of a hybrid nanoscale system consisting of MnAs NCs
embedded in the wurtzite (WZ) GaAs. MnAs is a ferromagnetic metal assuming it is in its native
(bulk) low-temperature phase, the hexagonal NiAs-type crystalline structure. The ferromagneticparamagnetic phase transition at about 313 K (40 oC) is associated with the structural one from the
hexagonal, NiAs-type (α-MnAs), to the orthorhombic MnP-type (β-MnAs) phase.22,23,24 This
structural transition is combined with the 2% volume contraction mainly due to the decrease of a
basal plane lattice parameter a.25 All of the previous literature reports on GaAs:MnAs hybrids
concerned planar samples, with MnAs nanoinclusions embedded in the zinc-blende GaAs thin films.
The moderate influence of strain on the magnetic properties of MnAs both in the form of epilayers
2

deposited on, and NCs embedded in the zinc-blende GaAs had already been noticed, but resulted in a
moderate increase of TC.26,27,28,29
The significance of our experimental findings is 2-fold. First, we show that the Curie temperature
in a ferromagnetic metal MnAs can be substantially increased from the textbook 313 K to above 400
K by the adequate nanostructure engineering. Namely, by employing the core-shell nanowire
geometry, we force (Ga,Mn)As shell to undertake the wurtzite structure, which then is thermally
transformed to the phase separated system containing tensely strained MnAs NCs in the wurtzite
GaAs surrounding. Second, we evidence the advantage of nanoscale structures (nanowires) with
crystallographic structures differing from that of the same materials in their pristine 3D (and 2D)
forms; enabling the appropriate strain engineering in hybrid (granular) systems based on such
nanowires. Our findings are evidenced by the combined high resolution transmission electron
microscopy, sensitive magnetometry investigations and ab initio calculations.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Core-multishell Ga0.92In0.08As-Ga0.60Al0.40As- Ga0.94Mn0.06As- GaAs NWs have been grown by
MBE on GaAs(111)B substrates using gold nanodroplet-assisted vapor-liquid-solid growth mode for
WZ Ga0.92In0.08As cores and epitaxial growth conditions for Ga0.60Al0.40As, Ga0.94Mn0.06As and GaAs
radial shells with a special attention paid to the growth of (Ga,Mn)As in this unique geometry.30
Typical NWs with the surface density of ~109 cm-2 are shown in the scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) image in Figure 1a and detailed in the schematic drawings in the panels b-d in Figure 1. The
intended chemical structure of NWs is revealed in the scanning transmission electron microscopy
(STEM) images, which are embedded in the panels b and c. In particular, we notice that all of the
subsequent shells are in a perfect epitaxial relation with sharp and coherent interfaces, i.e., all the
shells are tensely strained to the NW core, while inheriting the WZ core structure.
A part of these as-grown NWs (Figure 1a,b,c) has been subjected to the 20 min postgrowth
annealing at 450 ºC, resulting in the (Ga,Mn)As NWs shells transformation into the WZ-GaAs
matrix with phase separated ensembles of MnAs NCs, as shown in Figure 1d. The as–grown
(nonannealed) NWs were thoroughly analyzed previously.31
Structural investigations. The structure of the NWs is investigated using transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) methods. We examine both the entire NWs separated from the substrate as well
as their parts in the form of thin slices cut at various angles by the focused ion beam (FIB) technique.
The former enables skipping time-consuming preparation procedures and avoids degradation of the
sample material during thinning. The latter gives unambiguous insight into the details of this
complex core-shell architecture. In this way we eliminate the features originating from the entire
object illuminated by the electron beam and projected onto a 2D image plane.

NWs. (c-d) Schematics and scanning transmission electron microscopy visualizations of a sequence of crosssections seen perpendicularly and parallel to the growth axis of (c) as-grown NWs and (d) NWs annealed at
450 ºC. (e) Table describing chemical composition of subsequent building-blocks of the investigated NWs.

Results of the STEM analysis of the exemplary annealed NWs are presented in Figure 2. For these
measurements the NWs are transferred onto a TEM grid. As documented in the panel (a), a typical
NW is 2 µm long and its diameter varies from around 70 nm at the bottom part (close to the
substrate) to around 250 nm near the top. This diameter variation originates from a shadowing effect
occurring during the MBE shell growth.
The images shown in Figure 2 have been acquired in the STEM mode using a high angle annular
dark field (HAADF) detector which is sensitive to the average atomic number Z (“Z-contrast”). The
Al-rich shell is darker than pure GaAs – as shown in Figure 2b,c. However, at the specific conditions
(detailed in the Methods and Supporting Information) MnAs NCs appear as bright objects.

square marked in (d) with subtracted background and outlined particle shapes (f) histogram of the particle
cross-section areas distribution obtained from (e). Special conditions employed to obtain images in panel a-e
are detailed in the Methods.

A special specimen preparation is required to determine the distribution and shapes of individual
MnAs NCs. To this end we use thin cross-section specimens cut perpendicularly and parallel to the
growth axis as well as a small angle cut investigated in Figure 2b,c,d, respectively. This approach
allows performing the image analysis to determine the NCs areas distribution which yields 44 ± 6.0
nm2 as established from the Gaussian approximation presented in the panel (f), which corresponds to
~8 nm circle diameter. Such a low angle slice eliminates the other NCs from the field of view (from
the sides and the rear part of the NWs) and enables the most accurate estimation of their lateral
density in the shell, which amounts to 105 NCs/µm3 for the GaAs shell thickness of 50 nm.
The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) maps shown in Figure 2b,c,d prove the NW
homogeneity and the expected elemental composition of the core and each shell. The EDS maps
displayed in the panels (c) and (d) clearly confirm that the bright objects (NCs) correspond to the
volumes containing Mn. One can observe in Figure 2d some Ga-signal present in the Mn-rich area,
which comes from the GaAs matrix located under or over the MnAs NCs (common for the samples
thicker than the NCs diameter). Moreover, one may clearly notice in Figure 2c that the (Ga,Al)As
5

shell constitutes a diffusion barrier for Mn during annealing – Mn is detected at the level of noise <
0.2 at.% in the (Ga,Al)As shell and the core. However, as shown in Figure 2b, except of forming the
MnAs NCs in the former (Ga,Mn)As shell and the outermost GaAs shell, an excess of Mn
accumulates also at the NW surface. There is no direct comparison of the diffusion coefficients of
Mn in GaAs and in AlAs available in the literature, but a compilation of theoretical and experimental
values of the cohesive energy given in ref 32, clearly indicates that AlAs has a higher cohesion energy
than GaAs, which may result in the lower diffusion coefficient of Mn in (Ga,Al)As in comparison to
that in GaAs.

Since TEM/STEM images are the planar projections of 3D structures, it is very challenging to
prepare an ultra-thin specimen cut precisely through a small NC of interest without the surrounding
WZ-GaAs matrix. Therefore the high resolution (HR) images with Moiré patterns resulting from the
interference of these two similar structures are obtained, as exemplified in the panels (a) – (i) and
explained in the panels (j) – (n) of Figure 3. Clearly, different patterns are observed, depending on
the chosen zone-axis in the high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images. For
each of the three investigated main zone axes, the images of single NCs are presented in the panels
(b), (e), and (h) and compared to their structural ball model shown in the panels (c), (f), and (i),
respectively.
The strain state is the essential feature of MnAs NCs embedded in the GaAs matrix since it directly
influences their magnetic properties. The lattice mismatch:
𝑀=

𝑑𝑀𝑛𝐴𝑠𝒃 −𝑑𝐺𝑎𝐴𝑠𝒃
𝑑𝐺𝑎𝐴𝑠𝒃

,

between the bulk (as the lower index b indicates) hexagonal MnAs and the WZ-GaAs in reference to
the WZ-GaAs is equal to -6.9% in the [011̅0] direction and -13.0% in the [0001] direction [from the
values given in the panel (n) of Figure 3]. The formation of pseudomorphic (fully strained) MnAs
NCs embedded in the WZ-GaAs lattice is precluded due to the extremely high strain energy at such a
huge lattice mismatch. Similarly to the MnAs NCs embedded in the zinc-blende GaAs matrix, a
certain degree of strain relaxation in MnAs NCs is expected here.34 Hence, to enable this process,
geometrical dislocations are necessary to appear at the interface and an additional atomic plane of
MnAs should emerge every 2.27 nm in the [0001] direction. As the result the MnAs NCs of
diameters larger than 2.27 nm are expected to be relaxed, at least partially. To evaluate the MnAs
NCs residual strain (RS) the geometric phase analysis (GPA) is applied. This method quantifies the
displacements and strains in the crystalline structure employing digital signal processing algorithms
based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the HRTEM or HRSTEM images.35
The results of the GPA analysis are presented in Figure 4. We analyze the HRTEM image (Figure
4a) and HRSTEM image (Figure 4e) of the two NCs found in (a) the thicker and (e) the thinner
cross-sections of the NW shells. The first one (Figure 4a) is completely surrounded by the GaAs
matrix as explained by the 3D ball model shown in Figure 4i, whereas the second one (Figure 4e)
represents an ultra-thin area crossing centrally through the NC, exposing its structure to the electron
beam as visualized in Figure 4k. The ball projections shown in the panels (j) and (l) correspond well
to the HR-images displayed in the panels a and e. The FFT analysis of the HR-images presented in
Figure 4b,f confirms that the MnAs NCs are semi-coherent to the WZ-GaAs matrix (i.e. their unit
cells, shown in Figure 3(j-l), have the same crystallographic orientations).
7

The components maps of the lattice distortion tensor β – βxx and βyy, common for the GaAs matrix
and MnAs NC, are shown in Figure 4c,d,h. In our case the directions x and y correspond to the
[011̅0] and [0001], respectively. It should be noticed that β is a result of the derivate of the
displacement obtained from the lattice fringes common for MnAs and GaAs.35,36 The βxx and βyy
maps [the panels (c) and (d) in Figure 4] of the NC in the thicker cross-section (Figure 4a) reveal the
crossing discontinuities inside the NC related to dislocations at the 3D NC/matrix interface.
Regarding the NC in the thinner cross-section (Figure 4e), the βxx map (Figure 4h) reveals neither the
presence of the crossing discontinuities (Figure 4c,e), nor the existence of the dislocations inside the
NC. Characteristic spots around the NC perimeter seen in Figure 4h identify the positions of the
misfit dislocations cores.
Since  maps give an overall qualitative visualization of the projected lattice distortions, the
average values of the lattice distortion inside NCs can be obtained by a direct measurement of the
Bragg spots separation WZ-GaAs/MnAs in the FFT of HRSTEM images.37 Also in this case the
reciprocal space vectors g of the GaAs matrix lattice are used as a reference. The average value of 𝜷
is obtained from:
𝜷 =

1
1
−
𝑔𝑀𝑛𝐴𝑠 𝑔𝐺𝑎𝐴𝑠
1
𝑔𝐺𝑎𝐴𝑠

.

Finally, the average residual strain 𝜺 components inside the NC for specific direction are defined
as the difference between 𝜷 and M. For example, for the [0001] direction 𝜀 is given as:
𝜀𝑦𝑦 = 𝛽𝑦𝑦 − 𝑀[0001] =
𝜀𝑥𝑥 = 𝛽𝑥𝑥 − 𝑀[011̅0] =

𝑐𝑀𝑛𝐴𝑠 −𝑐𝑀𝑛𝐴𝑠𝒃
𝑐𝑀𝑛𝐴𝑠𝒃

𝑎𝑀𝑛𝐴𝑠 −𝑎𝑀𝑛𝐴𝑠𝒃
𝑎𝑀𝑛𝐴𝑠𝒃

,

.

In the case of the NC shown in Figure 4a the 𝛽𝑦𝑦 = −12.5% and 𝛽[011̅0] = −5.7 % which give
𝜀𝑦𝑦 = 0.5% and 𝜀𝑥𝑥 = 1.2%, respectively.
In this exemplary case, both residual strain components 𝜀 are positive, which means that the MnAs
NCs are under anisotropic tensile strain. Similar analysis performed for dozens of such NCs gives
generally positive magnitudes of 𝜀𝑦𝑦 and 𝜀𝑥𝑥 , which range from -0.2% to 2% and 0.3% to 1.3%,
respectively, i.e. 𝜀𝑥𝑥 assumes always positives values.

In general, TEM investigations confirm that MnAs NCs embedded in the WZ-GaAs are under
anisotropic tensile strain. Our HRTEM analysis shows that the NCs are stretched in all the directions,
but the strongest effect occurs along the c axis. To our best knowledge no similar strain
measurements for individual NCs embedded in GaAs are available in literature. The strain relaxation
in the lower symmetry WZ-GaAs should be less effective than that in the cubic GaAs due to fewer
equivalent primary slip systems (3 vs 12).38 However, the mechanism of the lattice relaxation and
misfit dislocation formation at the interface of WZ-GaAs matrix and MnAs NCs is extremely
complex and needs additional theoretical and experimental investigations. Additionally, in the NWs
analyzed here there are almost no voids associated with the MnAs NCs (with the few exceptions
shown in the supporting information), which were ubiquitously evidenced in the previous reports
9

concerning MnAs NCs embedded in the cubic GaAs

13-15

MnAs has a higher mass density than

(Ga,Mn)As so the lack of voids is surprising. It can be explained by the proximity of free surfaces,
which allow vacancies to out-diffuse towards the surface. On the other hand the lack of voids is the
advantage of the NWs studied here, since it results in the increase of the strain state of the MnAs
NCs hence it stabilizes the α-MnAs crystallographic phase up-to much higher temperatures. This
directly leads to the shift of the Curie temperature associated with the α to β transition as documented
below.
In the above analysis of strain exerted by WZ GaAs matrix on MnAs NCs we neglect the strain in
the shells originating from Ga0.92In0.08As core with the lattice parameter slightly higher than that of
(Ga,Al)As-GaAs shells. Because of the similar volumes of the core and the shell materials in the
NWs considered here, the longitudinal strain (along the NW axis) is equally distributed.39 Hence for
the Ga0.92In0.08As-GaAs core shell system with 0.5% lattice mismatch the longitudinal strain is about
0.25% in both components (with opposite sign for the core and the shells). This is over one order of
magnitude less than the mismatch between WZ GaAs and MnAs considered above, thus it does not
affect the GaAs-MnAs strain analysis in a significant way.
Magnetic properties. The magnetic properties of the as grown NWs are similar to those of the
previously reported core-shell nanowire structures containing (Ga,Mn)As.31 This underlines a very
good command over the growth procedure and the achieved reproducibility of the investigated
material. In short, the presence of Mn ions in the (Ga,Mn)As shell is responsible for the
ferromagnetic (FM) coupling in this part of the NWs. In the case of the as grown material the
coupling is effective only at the very low temperatures, as indicated in the panel (a) of Figure 5, and
operates at mesoscopically short distances, as elaborated previously for similar NWs30,31 and,
generally seen in the low hole density (Ga,Mn)As.30,40,41,42 Therefore, the magnetism of the thermally
non-treated NWs assumes a heterogeneous form akin to that of nanomagnets, however, with this
profound distinction that the whole Mn-rich shell is perfectly homogenous both chemically and
structurally. None of the structural or element sensitive characterization tools can actually point the
difference between these fragments that generate the magnetic flux and the rest of the sample.43 So,
as long as the growth conditions are not altered, 44 there can only be fluctuations in the local density
of states that could end up in a patchwork of spontaneously magnetized volumes (TC > T0) containing
a sufficiently high hole density to assure the FM spin-spin ordering within their phase coherence
length. In this scenario the rest of the material with too low hole density to mediate the effective
coupling remains nonmagnetic at the relevant temperature range (T > T0),40,45 where T0 is the base
temperature of an experimental setup.
A completely different picture is drawn by the annealed NWs. We start from a comparison of the
temperature dependence of the magnetic moment measured at a moderate magnetic field of 1 kOe.
The results shown in the panel (a) of Figure 5 are rescaled according to the area of the investigated
10

ensembles of NWs. It is clearly seen, that both samples exert nearly the same magnetic flux at T  T0,
confirming the high lateral uniformity of the NWs density. On the other hand, as the magnetic
response of the as grown NWs vanishes quickly above about 50 K, the annealed NWs stay
magnetized in the whole temperature window available for the experiment, that is up to 400 K, and
clearly above.
This finding corroborates our TEM results showing that the annealing triggers the crystallographic
phase separation, upon which the Mn ions regroup and form the NCs, identified as MnAs, known to
have the FM properties at room temperature. There is, however, more than just a switch to the
granular nano-magnetic system. The magnetic signal clearly persists beyond the highest available
temperature in our magnetometer (400 K) and even there it does not show a tendency to a critical fall
down. This indicates TC in excess of 400 K, a value exceeding by far the magnitude of TC in MnAs
as established previously9,22,26 and evidenced here again upon the identically measured m(T)
dependence of a reference MnAs layer grown by us in the same MBE system as that used for NWs
(the grey line in Figure 5a).
To approximate the magnitude of TC of our MnAs NCs more closely, we establish the values of the
saturation moment mS from the magnetic isotherms m(H) at high temperatures (detailed in the
supplementary information in Figure S7). Then we plot mS as the function of T (Figure 5b) together
with the basic shape of the T-dependent Brillouin function adjusted to match the experimental results
in the broadest possible range of T. The lack of a sharp decline of the experimental mS(T) at the
critical region indicates the existence of a sizable distribution of TC, which extends clearly above
400 K (~130 oC). The lower bound limit of this distribution has to be about 360 K, i.e. around the
temperature where the experimental data start to deviate from the Brillouin function. Combining
these two findings we can propose a scenario in which the MnAs NCs are strained so effectively by
the NW environment that on increasing T the FM -phase is preserved far above 313 K. For some
NCs the effect is so strong that they remain in the -phase until or above 400 K, that is until the
hexagonal  phase sets in, importantly, maintaining the FM order all the way through. The
experimental findings indicate therefore that the existing strain in the NWs bridges both hexagonal
- and - phases over the orthorhombic one. Most importantly this scenario indicates that the straininduced stabilization of the hexagonal form of MnAs leads to the FM ground state extending to
temperatures in which paramagnetic -MnAs emerges (in the bulk form). On the other hand it is
possible that not all the NCs are strained so effectively, so they transform to the -phase below
400 K and remain paramagnetic, so contributing marginally weak to mS. This scenario is
corroborated qualitatively by the first principle calculations presented in the next section.

information Figure S7.

First-principles investigation. To understand the large increase of TC in the strained MnAs NCs
embedded in the wurtzite GaAs matrix, we complement our analysis with the first-principles
calculations. As mentioned above the MnAs NCs are exposed to the large tensile strains in all the
directions but to a larger extent in the c direction. On the other hand, there is a significant difference
between the reported values of the elastic constants for α-MnAs in the c direction (c33 = 110 GPa)
with respect to those in the xy-plane (c11 = 40 GPa and c12 = 8 GPa).46 As a consequence, in the
strained MnAs NCs a larger strain relaxation is expected for c than for a lattice parameter. The
elastic properties of solids are usually well described by first-principles calculations47 (e.g. the c33
value calculated by us for of bulk α-MnAs is 115 GPa), therefore, we believe that the TC changes in
MnAs NCs as a consequence of stress will be also well captured.
The first-principles spin-polarized calculations are performed using a plane-wave basis, ultra-soft
Vanderbilt-type pseudopotentials, and the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof exchange-correlation functional
as implemented in the Quantum-ESPRESSO package.48 The plane-wave cut-off is set to be 60 Ry
(480 Ry for the electronic density) and a 8  8  8 k-point mesh for the Brillouin zone sampling is
used. The calculated equilibrium values of the lattice constant for MnAs in the NiAs structure are a =
3.717 Å and c = 5.545 Å and agree well with the earlier theoretical reports.49 The Curie temperature
is calculated (Figure 6) within the mean-field approximation (MFA) to the effective classical
Heisenberg Hamiltonian by using the following formula:
𝑇𝐶 =

𝐸𝐴𝐹𝑀 − 𝐸𝐹𝑀
∑ 𝐽0𝑗 𝑆0 𝑆𝑗 ≈

,
3𝑘𝐵
3𝑘𝐵
6𝑘𝐵
𝑗≠0
12

where kB is the Boltzmann constant, 𝐽0𝑗 is the exchange coupling constant of a given local spin 𝑆0
with the 𝑆𝑗 spin (𝑆0 = 𝑆𝑗 = 𝑆), 𝐸𝐴𝐹𝑀 − 𝐸𝐹𝑀 is the energy difference between antiferromagnetic
(AFM) and FM configurations of magnetic moments (spins) localized on Mn ions and is used to
evaluate the value of the exchange constant 𝐽𝑁𝑁 between the nearest neighbouring magnetic
moments.
The results of first-principles calculations are shown in Figure 6, where we plot TC as a function of
a and c lattice parameters. At zero stress 𝑇𝐶𝑀𝐹𝐴 = 382 𝐾, and it is by about 20% higher than the
experimental bulk value of 313 K. Although the mean-field theory usually overestimates TC by 1020%,50,51,52 it is relatively much more precise in predicting the variation of TC with strain51 or
pressure.52 Two observations are clear from the results of our calculations (Figure 6). First, TC
weakly depends on c (at least in the range of the relevant values of c) and second, TC considerably
changes with a in the vicinity of the zero stress (dashed line in Fig 6.). These results corroborate
qualitatively the experimentally observed TC increase in the stretched MnAs NCs described in the
previous sections. Our calculations unambiguously show the increasing trend of TC in tensely
strained MnAs NCs, despite the fact that the exact values of TC are overestimated.

CONCLUSIONS
In summary – we report on the huge, nearly 30% enhancement of the ferromagnetic phase
transition temperature in strained MnAs nanocrystals embedded in the wurtzite GaAs matrix, as
documented by the thorough magnetometry measurements. The effect is brought about by the stress
exerted by the wurtzite surrounding, which stabilizes the MnAs nanocrystals in their hexagonal αphase, the fact documented by the state of the art HRTEM and HRSTEM investigations. Our finding
is further supported by the first-principles calculations pointing on the Curie temperature magnitude
in the excess of 400 K in the tensely strained MnAs. The key result of our investigations is that the
specific geometry of the WZ-GaAs:MnAs granular system prevents the usually occurring 2% MnAs
lattice contraction associated with the ferromagnetic/hexagonal-to-paramagnetic/orthorhombic phase
transition in the bulk MnAs. This mechanism opens wide avenues for the development of novel
functional semiconductor-ferromagnetic hybrid nanostructures operating well above the room
temperature.
METHODS
The NWs have been grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on GaAs(111)B substrates covered
with (2 – 10 Å thick) pre-deposited gold layer. Gold has been deposited at room temperature, on epiready GaAs(111)B substrate surface, in a separate MBE system dedicated to metals. The substrates
have been then transferred (in air) to the III-V MBE system equipped with the Mn source (Knudsen
effusion cell). After introducing to the III-V MBE system and initial degassing of the substrates (at
200oC) for several hours, the substrates have been transferred to the MBE growth chamber. The
samples (Figure 1) have been first heated to the temperature of GaAs native oxide desorption (about
590 oC), then the substrate temperature has been decreased to 490 – 560 oC and the (Ga,In)As core
NWs have been grown for about 3 hours (lower temperature was applied for (Ga,In)As core NWs).
(Ga,Al)As shells have been deposited after completion of the axial growth at the substrate
temperature decreased to 440 oC. The substrate temperature has been further decreased to about 200
o
C for deposition of (Ga,Mn)As shell (Figure 1). For all the samples thin low temperature (LT) GaAs
capping shell has been ultimately deposited (at the temperature of (Ga,Mn)As shell growth).
For the annealing procedures the as-grown samples, taken out of the UHV MBE system has been
cleaved to pieces and reintroduced into the MBE system. Annealing has been performed in the MBE
growth chamber with samples placed at the MBE substrate holders. For the precise control of the
annealing temperatures the pieces of InAs(100) or GaAs(100) epi-ready substrates have been
mounted on the same sample holder in parallel to the pieces of GaAs(111)B substrates with the NWs
grown previously. Hence the absolute values of the annealing temperatures have been referenced to
the temperature of the native oxides desorption from InAs(100) (lower annealing temperature of 450
ºC). Overall changes in NWs structure under annealing at these a selected temperature are shown in
Figure 1.

Morphology and structure of the NWs have been investigated by the FEI Titan 80-300
transmission electron microscope (TEM) operating at 300 kV with spherical aberration corrector of
objective lenses in the HRTEM mode. The STEM–HAADF images have been obtained for a
different camera length of 70 mm to 280 mm, with converged semi angle of 9.5 mrad of the incident
beam. The best contrast (brighter MnAs NCs embedded in darker WZ-GaAs matrix) has been
obtained for the camera length of 230 mm and collection angles ranging from 25 mrad to 150 mrad
where the signal registered by the HAADF detector originates from both high angle scattering and
Bragg diffraction. Details are given in the supplementary information. The elemental composition
determination was performed by EDS using EDAX 30mm2 with collection angle 0.3 sr. Due to TEM
investigations requirements the samples need special preparation procedures. In the first approach
NWs have been transferred mechanically onto copper grids covered with holey carbon films
(supported by Pacific Grid-Tech), enabling imaging the entire NWs. In the second approach, the
cross-sections of resin-impregnated NWs have been cut using focused ion beam in Helios Nanolab
600 FIB as it is described in ref 53. Most of the investigations have been performed with a double tilt
holder enabling to orient the NWs to their easy zone axis. More detailed investigations (HRSTEM as
well as STEM SuperX-EDS) have been performed with the probe Cs-corrected FEI TITAN3 G2 60300 microscope equipped with the ChemiSTEM system, operating at 300 kV, 29.5 deg. semi
convergent angle of electron beam used for the atomic resolution STEM imaging. The lattice
distortion measurements by Geometric Phase Analysis have been performed with a homemade
software35 using the probe Cs-corrected HRSTEM – HAADF images of FIB cross-sections of NWs.
For the magnetic studies the NWs have been separated at cryogenic temperatures from their
substrates using an embedding film of PMMA [poly(methyl methacrylate), a popular e-beam
lithography resist], as detailed in the supporting information file. Such a PMMA flake containing
NWs has been attached to a customary cut long Si strips facilitating samples support54 in the
magnetometer chamber of a Quantum Design MPMS XL Superconducting Quantum Interference
Device (SQUID) magnetometer operating in a wide temperature range 2 < T < 400 K and in
magnetic field H up to 50 kOe. For all measurements H has been applied perpendicularly to the
wires, as this is the magnetically easy orientation for these NWs.31 During the measurements the
experimental code and data reduction methods specific for studies of minute magnetic signals have
been strictly followed.51

1. Optimization of scanning transmission electron microscope image contrast of MnAs
nanocrystals embedded in WZ-GaAs.
The difference of the visibility of MnAs nanocrystals (NCs) in the NW shell in the scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM) image obtained from angular dark field detector (ADF) at
two different camera lengths (CL) is obvious (Figure S1). At large camera lengths (more than 145
mm), a brighter contrast of the NCs in comparison to that of the matrix is observed. At CL of 145
mm there is no apparent contrast between the MnAs NCs and the GaAs matrix. With further CL
decrease down-to 91 mm or less, some NCs start to appear again as dark areas surrounded by the
brighter matrix (in other words the inversed contrast is observed), however, most of the NCs remain
faintly visible in the STEM images. This is shown in Figure S1 (a), (b) – ovals 1 and 2. In the case of
oval 3, additionally the void associated with the NC (indicated by arrow) is visible for both CLs. It
should be emphasized that very few voids are detected. mainly in the upper NWs parts. The
vacancies emerging during the transformation of (Ga,Mn)As dilute ferromagnetic semiconductor
into GaAs:MnAs granular system have migrated towards the NWs surface and no voids have
remained near the NCs. Only the individual voids appear due to the condensation of vacancies at
stacking faults, as shown by arrows in Figure S1 (a), (b).

21

Figure S1. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) annular dark field (ADF) images obtained
from oblique cross-section of a nanowire at different camera lengths: (a) 230 mm camera length and (b) 73
mm camera length. The dashed ovals indicate three characteristic places: 1 – the NCs vanish at short CLs, 2 –
the NCs start to appear as dark areas surrounded by the brighter matrix, 3 – the void (indicated by arrow)
associated with the NC is visible for both CLs.

This contrast dependence on CL cannot be linked directly to the so called “Z-contrast” due to the
contributions from diffraction components (Bragg spots) to the resulting STEM image. The classical
“Z-contrast” can be observed only for amorphous materials and individual atoms. In the case of
crystals the situation is more complex due to diffraction of the electron beam caused by periodic
features. To reduce the influence of the diffraction contrast in the case of crystalline samples the low
CLs are used to record the STEM images and to obtain preferential mass-thickness contrast. STEM
images recorded at high CL are dominated by the diffraction contrast. In our case the experimental
images obtained for short CL present very weak contrast between WZ-GaAs and MnAs. In contrary,
for CL larger than 230 mm the MnAs NCs appear brighter than the GaAs matrix. This is due to the
22

strong Bragg spots contribution to the intensity acquired on ADF detector because of the smaller
lattice parameter of MnAs (more Bragg spots reach detector in comparison to the diffraction from
the GaAs matrix). Similar effect has been observed before for MnAs NCs embedded in the cubic
GaAs matrix.1

Figure S2. The dependence of ADF collection angles on the camera length. The insets show the shape of cutoff function for uncorrected STEM mode at 300 kV and the scan of the ADF detector (Fischione model 3000)
together with the high angular cut-off of diffraction pattern with characteristic tree-fold features. Dashed
circles represent cut-off used in the STEM simulations.

To optimize the visibility of NCs in the WZ-GaAs matrix the series of STEM image simulations
were performed. Firstly, it is necessary to determine the collection angles for each CL of Titan 80300 microscope equipped with the image corrector, used in our research,. The dependence of the
collection angles on the camera lengths is presented in Figure S2. The upper (green) and lower (blue)
curves correspond to the outer and inner ADF detector collection angles, respectively. Their ratio is
limited by the active scintillator area and does not depend on the CL. This ratio is determined to be
equal to 6.1±0.2. The inner angle is measured using a beam deflection, the procedure described in
details in ref 2. The outer angle can be determined as the inner angle value multiplied by the
measured physical ratio (6.1 here). However, the impact of the cut-off angle of the microscope optics
on scattered electrons is significant for CLs below 145 mm.3 This happens when the transferred
23

diffraction has lower angular range than the outer ADF detector at small CLs. Because of that, not
the entire active area of ADF detector is illuminated. Moreover, almost all the diffraction patterns
reach the hole of the detector at 29.5 mm CL. Therefore, the usable outer ADF detector collection
angles are restricted by a smaller cut-off value or the scintillator area limitation. However, the
accurate determination of the cut-off angles is difficult due to the irregular shape and nonlinear scale
of the diffraction patterns at the edge.4 Taking into account these effects, the real clipping angles may
even be somehow larger than those shown in Figure S2.
The STEM image simulation was carried out using the QSTEM software 5 to verify the contrast as
a function of the CL. The chosen simulation parameters correspond to the experimental conditions
applied during image acquisition presented in the main paper: 300 kV acceleration voltage, 1 eV
energy spread of the electron beam. 9.5 mrad convergence angle, spherical aberration coefficient Cs
for not aberration corrected Titan with Super-Twin probe forming lenses of 1.2 mm and Scherzer
defocus. The In simulations, the maximum scattering angle is limited to 262.5 mrad. The chosen
detector scattering angles range correspond to the values presented in Figure S2. The simulation is
carried out without taking into account the thermal diffusion scattering.
To evaluate the dependence of the contrast on the CL, we consider a simplified model based on
MnAs and GaAs single layers. The main idea is to compare the scattered intensities for the
comparative thicknesses of the individual layers of MnAs and GaAs. This approximation applies to
sectioned NWs, were the MnAs NCs sizes are comparable to the GaAs matrix thicknesses. In the
model we use GaAs and MnAs layers of 100 unit cells thicknesses in < 112̅0 > crystallographic
direction. The simulated area is decreased to 25*25 Å for GaAs and MnAs layers with 0.25 Å pixel
size.
The contrast is calculated based on the following equation for simulated and experimental images
for all thicknesses:
C=

IMnAs -IGaAs
× 100% (1)
IGaAs

where IMnAs and IGaAs are the intensities of MnAs and GaAs calculated as the sum of the same
areas of simulated and experimental STEM images.

Figure S3. The contrast map calculated for the same thicknesses of MnAs and GaAs layers up to 37 nm (yaxis) and for CL range 73-460 mm (x-axis). For selected pixels (indicated by the arrows in the map) the pair
of simulated STEM images of MnAs and GaAs layers in the same intensity scale is given. The numbers in
parentheses refer to the sum of intensities of the simulated STEM image.

Figure S3 shows the contrast map calculated for simulated STEM images. Each pixel represents
contrast value calculated using equation (1). For all the thicknesses at CLs less than 145 mm a
relatively weak change in contrast is obtained. For larger CLs the contrast change is much more
pronounced. This is due to the channeling effect. More precisely, the extinction lengths are slightly
different for GaAs and MnAs (Figure S4), which causes mutual shift of the intensity maxima and
significantly affects the contrast.
25

Similar effect of MnAs and GaAs channeling, is observed for different atomic Mn, As and Ga
columns in the simulated data. Due to the redistribution of the intensity along the atomic columns, it
is manifested as vanishing of some columns in the STEM image. We notice the enhancement of this
effect with changed/increased CL in the simulated images. The effect is more pronounced for MnAs
with more significant difference between the atomic numbers of Mn (25) and As (33) - compare
simulation patters pairs in Figure S3.
These simplified simulations do not entirely agree with the experimental observation. The
experimental contrast is calculated similarly as a simulated one. The obtained contrast value is equal
to -4±3% for 73 mm CL, about 0±3% for 91-145 mm CLs, 13.4±4% for 230 mm CL and 15.4±4%
for 285 mm CL. As can be seen in Figure S3, there are no pixels with a negative value. Nevertheless,
the enhancement of the contrast with the CL increase, confirmed by the experiment, is clearly
manifested here. The smallest contrast value, displayed in Figure S3 is about 4% which is close to
the experimental results at small CL but still does not reach a negative value.

Figure S4. The average intensities of the simulated STEM images of MnAs and GaAs crystals as a function of
thicknesses for 73 and 285 mm CLs. The effect of channeling is clearly visible for 285 mm CL.

To clarify this, more realistic simulation based on the model of spherical 8 nm hexagonal MnAs
NC embedded in the WZ GaAs matrix is performed. The resulting contrast map is presented in
Figure S5. The areas from MnAs NC and GaAs matrix indicated in Figure S5b by orange frames, are
26

used to calculate the contrast values. The homogeneous horizontal band visible at the contrast map
up to 2 nm (Figure S5a), with close to zero contrast, indicates that the simulation still does not reach
MnAs NC. The embedded NC emerges at a 2 nm depth.
In the contrast map shown in Figure S5a, two characteristic regions with negative (73-115 mm)
and positive (185-460 mm) CL are clearly visible confirming qualitatively the experiment
observations. It should be noted, that the most pronounced positive and negative contrast occur at
different depths. This occurs due to the channeling effect as described above. and additionally
influences the radial contrast variation visible in Figure S5.

To summarize this contrast analysis – the best visibility and signal-to-noise ratio of MnAs NC
embedded in WZ GaAs matrix can be obtained using ADF Fischione 3000 detector and CL ranging
from 230 to 360 mm. In these conditions the image contrast is dominated by contribution of MnAs
Bragg spots to the image intensity without WZ-GaAs Brag spots contribution, related to the
difference in the lattice parameters of WZ-GaAs and MnAs crystals.
2. Magnetic measurements
2.1 Sample preparation
Except of the NWs there are two other sources of the magnetic signal present on the typical “outof-the-growth-chamber” specimens: the bulky semiconductor substrate, and the material that has
non-intentionally grown in-between the NWs. The first component, the diamagnetic response of the
substrate, GaAs in this case, does not pose any thread to the fidelity of the current studies. Given the
sufficiently substantial magnitude of the magnetic flux exerted by Mn-containing NWs – a linear in
magnetic field H and temperature T independent diamagnetic component of GaAs can be established
independently and subtracted from the final results, rescaled properly to match the weight of the
NWs-carrying sample and its physical dimensions.6 The second component constitutes a far greater
experimental problem , since its magnetic properties are a priori completely unknown. This is
mainly because very little is usually known about the stoichiometry of the compound which has been
deposited in-between the NWs during the growth of NWs cores and their subsequent overgrowths. In
addition, the shadowing effect plays its role too, so neither the chemical composition nor the
crystallographic structure are established, particularly that these properties are usually out of the
scope of the research. In the case of the present studies the presence of magnetic species there makes
the contribution of these layers to the total magnetic response significant.
In order to completely eliminate both spurious contributions to the magnetic signal we adopt the
same method used in our previous studies of NWs containing (Ga,Mn)As,7,8 proposed originally in
ref 9. The method relies on a large difference of the thermal contraction between the semiconductor
substrate and typical poly-resin. We use poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA, the commonly used ebeam resist), which coats the NWs-containing surface to a thickness of a small fraction of a
millimeter, and then subsequently slowly cool the whole sandwich down to the cryogenic
temperatures. There, the PMMA layer peels off taking all the NWs with itself. Such a NW
containing PMMA flake is sufficiently robust and constitutes a convenient specimen for magnetic
studies. The main advantage of this method is that the layer contracting PMMA reaps only the NWs,
28

so both the whole substrate and the parasitic layer grown in-between the NWs is left behind. The
effectiveness of this process is exemplified in Figure S6, where we present birds eye views over a
few areas of the XYZ sample after a large PMMA flake peeled off with the NWs from the substrate.
Equally important for magnetic studies, this method also preserves the mutual orientation of the
NWs, what can facilitate magnetic anisotropy studies. On the other hand, the employment of PMMA
introduces another magnetic response, so it is of a paramount importance to experimentally quantify
its magnitude. The magnetic tests of the PMMA used for the separation of the NWs in this study
indicate only a weak, linear in H diamagnetic response at elevated temperatures relevant here. It gets
only marginally modified by a small paramagnetic components at the lowest temperatures, T < 10 K,
which can be disregarded in these predominantly high temperature studies. The flakes obtained here
of both as grown and annealed ensembles of NWs prove sufficiently robust to withstand the whole
suite of magnetic measurements without any additional supporting carriers or casings.

after peeling off the PMMA. (a) A mechanically disturbed edge part of the sample which has not been covered
with PMMA. The mechanically floored or removed NWs unravel the state of the surface after complete
removal of the NWs. (b) A close up view on that part of sample form which NWs are lifted by the PMMA. A
clearing-like appearance of the surface indicates a successful transfer of the NWs into the PMMA flake. (c-d)

the bonds between the NWs and the substrate (right hand sides of both images).

2.2 Determination of the saturation magnetic moment at high temperatures
We establish the values of the saturation moment mS of the MnAs NCs in the NWs from magnetic
isotherms m(H) measured at high temperatures. The results are presented in Figure S7, where the
original magnetic data sets are already corrected for the diamagnetic signal of the PMMA material
(flake) embedding the NWs. The diamagnetic contribution of the PMMA has been obtained from the
high temperature m(H) measured for another flake containing the non-annealed NWs and rescaling it
according to the weights of both flakes. In this approach we take advantage that the magnetic signal
of the paramagnetic Mn ions in the as grown (Ga,Mn)As shells is vanishingly small in comparison to
the signal of the PMMA flake at elevated temperatures.
