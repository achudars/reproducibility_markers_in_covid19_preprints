The superradiant scattering of AlfveÃÅn waves (AlfveÃÅnic superradiance) in a forcefree magnetosphere
is discussed to reveal the relationship between the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process and superradiance.
For simplicity, we consider a four-dimensional rotating black string spacetime of which each z = const
slice is a BanÃÉados-Teitelboim-Zanelli solution as an analogy of the equatorial plane of the Kerr
spacetime. Then, it is confirmed that the condition for AlfveÃÅnic superradiance coincides with that
for the BZ process, and the wave amplification can be very large due to a resonant scattering for
some parameter sets of the wave frequency and the angular velocity of the magnetic field line.
Moreover, by analysis of the Poynting flux, we first show that the BZ process can be interpreted as
the long wavelength limit of AlfveÃÅnic superradiance.

INTRODUCTION

As rotational energy extraction processes from black
holes, the Penrose process, superradiance, and the
Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process are widely discussed.
The Penrose process is energy exchange between particles
by splitting or collisions inside the ergoregion [1, 2]. By
transitioning one particle to a negative energy orbit, the
other particle can acquire energy larger than that of the
initial incident particle. Superradiance is a similar mechanism for waves [3‚Äì8]. The waves incident toward the
black hole are scattered, and they can be propagated to
a distant region with amplification if the following condition is satisfied: 0 < œâ/m < ‚Ñ¶H , where ‚Ñ¶H is the angular
velocity of the black hole, m is the azimuthal quantum
number for a wave mode, and œâ is the frequency of the
incident wave.
The BZ process [9] is an energy extraction mechanism
via electromagnetic fields from a rotating black hole. It
is thought that the electromagnetic fields in the vicinity
of black holes are so strong that they are dominant and
the inertia of plasma can be ignored (forcefree approximation). Therefore, the BZ process is often discussed
for the forcefree magnetosphere. The mechanism works
as follows. The magnetic torque acts on magnetic field
lines due to the spacetime dragging effect, and the rotational energy of spacetime is transported outward in
the form of the Poynting flux. This energy extraction is
possible under the condition 0 < ‚Ñ¶F < ‚Ñ¶H , where ‚Ñ¶F
is the angular velocity of the magnetic field lines. The

BZ process has been studied for several situations in analytical way [10‚Äì13] and by numerical calculations [14‚Äì20]
for black hole magnetospheres. Toma and Takahara [10]
revealed that the ergoregion is crucial for generating the
outward Poynting flux, and Kinoshita and Igata [13] discussed that the light surface of the background magnetic
field has to be inside the ergoregion for the BZ process.
Moreover, there are several works regarding the relationship between the Penrose process or superradiance and
the BZ process [7, 21]. However, the relationship has not
been clarified so far.
The BZ process is driven by background electromagnetic fields, but in a forcefree magnetosphere, propagation of fast magnetosonic waves and AlfveÃÅn waves also
occur. Thus, these waves can contribute to the energy extraction process, for example, via superradiance. Indeed,
superradiance for fast magnetosonic waves which is longitudinal mode has been discussed in papers by Uchida
[22, 23] and van Putten [24]. The condition for it is the
same as the ordinary superradiance for scalar, vector, and
tensor waves. Furthermore, it was argued that superradiance for AlfveÃÅn waves (AlfveÃÅnic superradiance) does
not occur through the discussion based on the eikonal
approximation. However, it is still possible to amplify
AlfveÃÅn waves in the treatment without eikonal approximation. Indeed, in the numerical calculations [14, 16],
the outward propagation of AlfveÃÅn waves generated in
the ergoregion is important for energy extraction. Since
an AlfveÃÅn wave is a transverse wave mode propagating
along magnetic field lines due to the magnetic tension, we
can discuss energy extraction along magnetic field lines
if AlfveÃÅnic superradiance is possible. To see this, we analyze the wave equation for AlfveÃÅn waves. Moreover, by
decomposition of the Poynting flux into the contribution
of the background electromagnetic field and the perturbation, it will be shown that the BZ process is explained
as the long wavelength limit of AlfveÃÅnic superradiance.

In order to obtain a magnetosphere solution around a
black hole, it is necessary to solve the general relativistic Grad-Shafranov equation [9]. For the Kerr spacetime,
this equation cannot be solved globally in an analytical
way. Therefore, in this paper, we consider a simpler geometry with cylindrical symmetry which can be a good
model to discuss the essence of phenomena in the Kerr
spacetime.
This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we derive
a stationary and axisymmetric magnetosphere solution
in the cylindrical spacetime, and the BZ process in this
spacetime is discussed. Then, we give a perturbation
to the magnetosphere to obtain the wave equations in
section III. Sec. IV is devoted to the derivation of the
condition for AlfveÃÅnic superradiance and the evaluation
of how much the AlfveÃÅn waves can be amplified. Sec V
discusses the relationship between the BZ process and
AlfveÃÅnic superradiance before concluding the paper in
Sec VI.

A.

Black cylinder spacetime

We consider the forcefree electromagnetic fields in a
four-dimensional black string spacetime (black cylinder)
[12] with a scale factor f (z) as a benchmark to discuss
the BZ process. The metric gŒªŒΩ is given as
2

ds2 = ‚àíŒ±2 dt2 +Œ±‚àí2 dr2 +r2 (dœï ‚àí ‚Ñ¶dt) +f (z)2 dz 2 , (1)
where Œ± and ‚Ñ¶ are functions of the radial coordi2
2
)/(r2 `2 ), ‚Ñ¶ :=

nate given as Œ±2 := (r2 ‚àí r+
2
r+ r‚àí /(r `), and ` denotes the AdS curvature scale related to the negative cosmological constant as Œõ3 =
‚àí`‚àí2 . This spacetime has two horizons as the Kerr
spacetime and their radii r¬± are given by Œ±(r¬± ) = 0.
Each constant-z slice of the spacetime is a BanÃÉadosTeitelboim-Zanelli black hole [25], and hence, the horizon geometry is cylindrical. The mass and angular momentum of the black cylinder can be written with r¬±
2
2
as M = (r+
+ r‚àí
)/`2 , J = 2r+ r‚àí /`. These parameters
satisfy J ‚â§ M `, and hence the spin parameter defined as
a := J/(`M ) should be less than unity for the spacetimes
to have horizons. Using the parameter a, the angular velocity at the horizon ‚Ñ¶H := ‚Ñ¶(r+ ) is

The reason why we added the ‚Äúextra‚Äù dimension to the
three-dimensional black hole solution is that we need to
consider a four-dimensional spacetime to discuss the ordinary electromagnetic fields for astrophysics. Moreover,
the Grad-Shafranov equation can be solved by choosing the functional form of the scale factor f (z) properly. Since, in this model, f (z) is an arbitrary function

of z, we choose it as f (z) = cos (¬µz) for ¬µ2 > 0 and
f (z) = cosh (|¬µ|z) for ¬µ2 < 0 with a constant ¬µ.

B.

Forcefree magnetosphere in the black cylinder
spacetime

We consider a stationary and axisymmetric forcefree
magnetosphere in this spacetime. Within the forcefree
approximation mentioned in Sec. I, the Maxwell equation yields the following set of equations: FŒªŒΩ ‚àáŒ≤ F ŒΩŒ≤ =
0, ‚àá[Œª FŒΩŒ≤] = 0. The field strength FŒªŒΩ satisfying these
equations can be represented by two scalars, called Euler
potentials [26, 27], as
F¬µŒΩ = ‚àÇ¬µ œÜ1 ‚àÇŒΩ œÜ2 ‚àí ‚àÇŒΩ œÜ1 ‚àÇ¬µ œÜ2 ,

(3)

and the Maxwell equation reduces to the equations for
œÜ1 and œÜ2 :

(4)
where Œª, ŒΩ, Œ±, Œ≤ = t, r, œï, z. For the stationary and axisymmetric solution, we can consider the following ansatz
for Euler potentials [28]: œÜ1 = Œ®(z), œÜ2 = h(r)+œï‚àí‚Ñ¶F t,
where the angular velocity of the magnetic field lines ‚Ñ¶F
is a constant. From Eq. (4), we obtain

dr
œÜ1 = ‚àíœàz dzf (z), œÜ2 =
+ œï ‚àí ‚Ñ¶F t, (5)
2œÄœàz
rŒ±2
where constants œàz and I are the magnetic monopole line
density located on the z axis and the electric current, respectively. The function œÜ1 corresponds to the stream
function of the magnetosphere and œÜ1 = const gives the
so-called magnetic surface. For the present model, a magnetic surface is a constant-z plane, whereas œÜ2 = const
defines the configuration of the magnetic field lines on
each magnetic surface [13, 22, 23, 26‚Äì28].
To clarify the situation we are considering, we compute
the components of the electromagnetic fields measured by
a fiducial observer of which four-velocity is given as uŒΩ =
(‚àíŒ±, 0, 0, 0). The electric and magnetic fields are defined as E ŒΩ = F ŒΩŒ≤ uŒ≤ and B ŒΩ = ‚àí‚àó F ŒΩŒ≤ uŒ≤ , respectively.
‚àö
The dual tensor is defined as ‚àó F ŒΩŒ≤ = ‚àíŒΩŒ≤ŒªœÅ /(2 ‚àíg)FŒªœÅ
with the completely antisymmetric tensor. Substituting
the solution (5) into these definitions, we get the following nonzero components of the electromagnetic fields:
œàz f (z)

f (z)I
(‚Ñ¶F ‚àí ‚Ñ¶), B r = œàz f (z), B œï = ‚àí

The axial current I generates the toroidal magnetic field
B œï (AmpeÃÄre‚Äôs law), and the rotating (moving) radial
magnetic field B r (sourced by a magnetic monopole density distributed on the z-axis) generates the electric field
E z (Faraday‚Äôs law). The configuration and the magnetic
field lines for the present system are shown in Fig. 1 and
Fig. 2, respectively.

boundary. For the present parameters, the radius of the light surface is rLS ' 1.1r+ . For the radial coordinate, we mapped the
range r+ < r < ‚àû to the finite one arctan (r+ /`) < rÃÉ < œÄ/2
through the transformation rÃÉ = arctan (r/`).

The BZ process for the present model

The BZ process works for this model as discussed by
Jacobson and Rodriguez [12] who considered f (z) = 1
case. In the present model, E z and B œï generate the
radial Poynting flux E r . Although the detailed computation of the Poynting flux including the wave effect (perturbation) will be discussed in Sec. V, let us now show
only the flux by the background magnetosphere here:
E r = I‚Ñ¶F œàz ,

WAVE PROPAGATION

Wave equations and wave modes

Let us discuss the propagation of waves in the background magnetosphere. First of all, we define the perturbation to the Euler potential œÜi ‚Üí œÜi + Œ¥œÜi (t, r, œï, z) as
Œ¥œÜi := Œ∂iŒª ‚àÇŒª œÜi . The displacement vectors Œ∂iŒª are assumed
to be functions of t, r, œï. Hereafter, we focus on the wave
propagations on the magnetic surface given by z = 0,
where the scale factor f (z) is unity, its first derivative
becomes zero, and the second derivative is ‚àí¬µ2 . Taking
the first-order terms of Eq. (4), we obtain the following
equations for Œ¥œÜ1 and Œ¥œÜ2 :

where j = t, r, œï and the square bracket represents the
anticommutator. The perturbation Œ¥œÜ2 obeys the KleinGordon equation, and the dispersion relation is the same
as that of a massless particle. This is one of the features
of the fast magnetosonic wave [22, 23]. Although the
fast magnetosonic wave propagates on a magnetic surface
due to the assumption of the perturbation, in general,
its propagation is not restricted on a magnetic surface
[31], whereas the perturbation Œ¥œÜ1 corresponds to the
AlfveÃÅn wave, which always propagates along a magnetic
field line on a magnetic surface, as we will see later. It
can be shown that the Poynting flux of the BZ process
flows on the magnetic surface [13], and our aim is to
investigate the relationship between the BZ process and
the propagation of the AlfveÃÅn waves. Therefore, we focus
only on the AlfveÃÅn wave mode.
B.

Propagation of AlfveÃÅn waves

Considering the similarity between the propagation of
AlfveÃÅn waves and the Poynting flux via the BZ process,

4

where œÅ is œÜ2 itself, and each œÅ = const gives a magnetic
field line. Therefore, œÅ is a coordinate perpendicular to
the magnetic field lines. The differential operators with
respect to the new coordinates are ‚àÇœÑ = ‚àÇt + ‚Ñ¶F ‚àÇœï and
‚àÇœÉ = ‚àÇr ‚àí I/(2œÄœàz rŒ±2 )‚àÇœï . In these coordinates, the

where (Œ¥œÜ1 )zz = ‚àí¬µ2 Œ¥œÜ1 due to the definition of
the perturbation and the background field configuration.
The functions C1 and C2 are defined as
C1 := 1 + I 2 /(4œÄ 2 Œ±2 œàz2 ) and C2 := I 2 /(4œÄ 2 œÉ 2 Œ±2 œàz2 ) ‚àí
(‚Ñ¶ ‚àí ‚Ñ¶F )2 /Œ±2 + 1/œÉ 2 , respectively. The function Œì is
the norm of the corotating vector of the field line œáŒΩF =
ŒΩ
ŒΩ
(‚àÇt ) + ‚Ñ¶F (‚àÇœï ) :
Œì = gŒªŒΩ œáŒªF œáŒΩF = ‚àíŒ±2 + r2 (‚Ñ¶ ‚àí ‚Ñ¶F )2 .

(14)

The zero point of Œì gives the location of the light surface,
which is the causal boundary for AlfveÃÅn waves [27], and
we denote its location by r = rLS . For black hole magnetospheres, in general, there exist inner and outer light
surfaces. The inner one is caused by the gravitational
redshift, whereas the outer one stems from the fact that
the velocity of rigidly rotating magnetic field lines exceed
the speed of light. For the present model, there is only
one light surface in the vicinity of the black cylinder‚Äôs
horizon due to the asymptotic feature of the spacetime,
and the norm is negative everywhere outside the light
surface [32]. Note that Eq. (13) does not have a derivative term with respect to œÅ. This means the perturbation
Œ¥œÜ1 propagates only on a two-dimensional sheet spanned
by œÑ and œÉ, called a field sheet [13, 22, 23, 26‚Äì28], which
represents the time evolution of a magnetic field line.
Therefore, we can identify Œ¥œÜ1 as an AlfveÃÅn wave. Of
course, Œ¥œÜ1 has œÅ dependence through the function A(œÅ)
as Œ¥œÜ1 ‚àù A(œÅ). However, this factor is a constant for
wave propagation along a magnetic field line.
To eliminate the cross term of œÑ and œÉ, we choose another set of coordinates (T, X) on the field sheet, defined
as

can separate the variables as Œ¥œÜ1 = R(X)A(œÅ)e‚àíiœâT ‚àÇz œÜ1

In the present treatment, we assume 0 < ‚Ñ¶F ` < 1 for
which the region X < XLS becomes a super-AlfveÃÅn region
as in the case of the ordinary context of a black hole

by the relation R = K ‚àí1/2 RÃÉ, K := 1+XLS /(XLS + ` ex ),

limit (œâ 2 `2  1, |¬µ2 |`2  1), there is no reflection of
waves because the top of the potential barrier goes below

where Œ±LS := Œ±(rLS ) and ‚Ñ¶LS := ‚Ñ¶(rLS ). If the following
inequality is satisfied,
0 < ‚Ñ¶F < ‚Ñ¶LS ,

(23)

then the reflection rate |Aout /Ain |2 exceeds unity, namely,
the AlfveÃÅn wave is amplified when scattered by the potential (AlfveÃÅnic superradiance). Note that condition (23)
is different from the superradiant condition for ordinary
waves (e.g. scalar waves) 0 < œâ/m < ‚Ñ¶H . In the case of
AlfveÃÅn waves, the condition (23) depends on the angular velocity of the magnetic field lines ‚Ñ¶F instead of on
œâ/m. This reflects the fact that an AlfveÃÅn wave propagates along a magnetic field line and the separation
of variable œï is not necessary. Furthermore, the upper
boundary of the condition (23) is the angular velocity of
the spacetime at the light surface instead of that of the
horizon because the light surface is a one-way boundary
for AlfveÃÅn waves. Although condition (23) does not have
the wave frequency, the reflection rate |Aout /Ain |2 itself
depends on œâ, as we show in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5.

FIG. 5: 3D Plot of the reflection rate on the œâ-‚Ñ¶F plane.

As shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, indeed, the reflection rates
exceed unity if the AlfveÃÅnic superradiant condition is satisfied. The value of the upper bound of the condition (23)
is ‚Ñ¶LS ' 0.63 for a = 0.9. Moreover, we observed that
the reflection rate becomes very large or very small for
some parameter sets (œâ, ‚Ñ¶F ). These features correspond
to resonant scattering and perfect absorption of AlfveÃÅn
waves. They occur when the values of the effective potential at the light surface and far region coincide with
each other. From the asymptotic values of the effective
potential (20),pthe resonant frequency
œâres is obtained as

œâres = (r+ /`) ‚àí¬µ2 1 ‚àí `2 ‚Ñ¶H ‚Ñ¶F .

V.

ALFVEÃÅNIC SUPERRADIANCE AND THE
BZ PROCESS

How does AlfveÃÅnic superradiance relate to the BZ process? Interestingly, it turns out that condition (23) is

6
exactly the same as the condition for the BZ process
0 < ‚Ñ¶F < ‚Ñ¶H as follows: Considering the fact that ‚Ñ¶LS
is a function of ‚Ñ¶F :
‚Ñ¶LS (‚Ñ¶F ) =

1 ‚àí `2 ‚Ñ¶2F
a,
2`(1 ‚àí `‚Ñ¶F a)

(24)

we solve the inequality (23) for ‚Ñ¶F . Then, we obtain


p
(25)
0 < ‚Ñ¶F < `‚àí1 a/(1 + 1 ‚àí a2 ) = ‚Ñ¶H ,
where the equality comes from Eq. (2).
We investigate the Poynting flux, including the effect
of AlfveÃÅn waves. To do that, we introduce the conserved
energy flux vector with the timelike Killing vector (‚àÇt )ŒΩ
ŒΩ
as P Œª = ‚àíT ŒªŒΩ (‚àÇt ) , where the energy momentum tensor
Œ±
is TŒªŒΩ = FŒªŒ± FŒΩ ‚àí (1/4)FŒ±Œ≤ F Œ±Œ≤ gŒªŒΩ . Integrate P Œª for
the azimuthal angle œï and define E Œª := 2œÄrP Œª , then the
energy flux per unit time over a section of a cylinder with
a unit z-length and a constant radius r ' rLS is
zero mode

perturbation

Note that all the terms have the common factor I‚Ñ¶F ‚àù
‚Ñ¶F (‚Ñ¶H ‚àí ‚Ñ¶F ). This factor for the BZ term comes from
the Znajek condition, whereas the Poynting flux of the
perturbation is proportional to (‚Ñ¶LS ‚àí ‚Ñ¶F ), which comes
from the condition for AlfveÃÅnic superradiance. However,
it can be shown that (‚Ñ¶LS ‚àí ‚Ñ¶F ) ‚àù (‚Ñ¶H ‚àí ‚Ñ¶F ), therefore
we can factorize Eq. (26) with ‚Ñ¶F (‚Ñ¶H ‚àí ‚Ñ¶F ). The perturbation term depending on œâ 2 enhances the flux of the
BZ process when AlfveÃÅnic superradiance occurs. Furthermore, the zero mode of the perturbation enhances
the flux for the ¬µ2 < 0 case in which AlfveÃÅn waves can
propagate to a distant region. Actually, the contribution of the zero mode term can be incorporated into the
BZ term as a small deformation
 of the background field:
œàz2 ‚Üí œàz2 1 ‚àí (¬µ2 /2)|A|2 |R|2 . If we redefine the modified one as a new background field [34], Eq. (26) with the
limit œâ ‚Üí 0 is nothing but the energy flux of the BZ process for the deformed magnetic fields. Therefore, the BZ
process is explained as the zero mode limit of AlfveÃÅnic
superradiance. In this sense, AlfveÃÅnic superradiance is
a more general energy extraction process that includes
the BZ process. Furthermore, the resonant scattering
implies that AlfveÃÅnic superradiance can be dominant in
the energy extraction process, although our perturbative

relativity, Riv. Nuovo Cimento. 1, 252 (1969)
[2] S. M. Wagh, S. V. Dhurandhar, and N. Dadhich, Revival
of the Penrose process for astrophysical applications, As-

approach will break down. Therefore, it is necessary to
confirm this with numerical simulation.
Before closing this section, let us remark on the Kerr
black hole case, in which there are some different points
from the present model. First, there exists outer light
surface besides the inner one that is also causal boundary for AlfveÃÅn waves. Hence, we need to consider purely
outgoing boundary conditions for AlfveÃÅn waves there. By
considering the case that the AlfveÃÅn waves occur at an
inner point of the outer light surface, where the effective potential is flat enough in the tortoise coordinate,
it is possible to use the same technique discussed in the
present paper. Second, the stream function œÜ1 (r, Œ∏) depends on the radial and polar coordinates. It makes the
problem more difficult because in order to consider the
force balance between magnetic surfaces, we need to solve
the general relativistic Grad-Shafranov equation [9]. Although there are above differences, we have already confirmed that the condition for AlfveÃÅnic superradiance coincides with that for the BZ process even for the Kerr
case. We will discuss the details in the next paper.
Moreover, when magnetic field lines connect to an accretion disk and or jet around the black hole, we may see
interesting phenomenon: AlfveÃÅn waves can be confined
in the finite region between the black hole and the disk
or jet, then AlfveÃÅnic superradiance may occur repeatedly
like black hole bomb [30].

VI.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

We investigated energy extraction mechanisms from a
rotating black cylinder spacetime with a forcefree magnetosphere to reveal the relationship between the BZ process and AlfveÃÅnic superradiance. Through the evaluation
of the superradiant condition and the Poynting flux, we
showed that the BZ process is, in fact, the zero mode limit
of AlfveÃÅnic superradiance. The result of the present paper implies that the wave phenomenon is important for
discussing the engine of high-energy astrophysical compact objects such as gamma ray bursts and active galactic
nuclei.

[31] For the Kerr case, we can explicitly show that the fast
magnetosonic waves can propagate in the off-magnetic
surface direction under the symmetric assumption on the
perturbation.
[32] This is one of the different points from the magnetosphere
in the Kerr spacetime, for which there exists the outer
light surface as well.
[33] Strictly speaking, the wave does not propagate at x ‚Üí ‚àû
because the exponents do not include the frequency œâ. At
a distant
of the effective potential is
 point, œâ-dependence

Veff = ¬µ2 ‚àí œâ 2 /(Œ≥e2x ) `2 . Therefore, we define the ingoing/outgoing modes by considering the sign of the second
term including œâ. However, it is very small at a distant
point, and hence we omit this term in the asymptotic
form of the wave function (21).
[34] Note that redefining the background field by shifting œàz2
is consistent with the components of the electromagnetic
fields (6) and the Znajek condition (8).
