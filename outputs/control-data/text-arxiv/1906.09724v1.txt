ABSTRACT

We have observed the Class I protostellar source Elias 29 with Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). We have detected CS, SO,

34

SO, SO2 ,

and SiO line emissions in a compact component concentrated near the protostar
and a ridge component separated from the protostar by 400 (∼ 500 au). The
former component is found to be abundant in SO and SO2 but deficient in CS.
2
The abundance ratio SO/CS is as high as 3+13
−2 ×10 at the protostar, which is even

higher than that in the outflow-shocked region of L1157 B1. However, organic
molecules (HCOOCH3 , CH3 OCH3 , CCH, and c-C3 H2 ) are deficient in Elias 29.
We attribute the deficiency in organic molecules and richness in SO and SO2 to
> 20
the evolved nature of the source or the relatively high dust temperature ( ∼
K) in the parent cloud of Elias 29. The SO and SO2 emissions trace rotation
around the protostar. Assuming a highly inclined configuration (i ≥ 65◦ ; 0◦ for a
face-on configuration) and Keplerian motion for simplicity, the protostellar mass
is estimated to be (0.8 – 1.0) M . The 34 SO and SO2 emissions are asymmetric in
their spectra; the blue-shifted components are weaker than the red-shifted ones.
Although this may be attributed to the asymmetric molecular distribution, other
possibilities are also discussed.

Introduction

Because star formation is a gravitational collapse of a parent molecular cloud core, the
physical and chemical evolution of protostellar sources is affected by environmental effects
on the parent core. In addition to the physical diversity of newly born protostars, such as in
a single, multiple, or cluster form, the chemical diversity of protostellar sources has recently
been recognized on size scales from 1000 au down to 10 au (Sakai et al. 2008; Lindberg &
Jørgensen 2012; Sakai & Yamamoto 2013; Graninger et al. 2016; Imai et al. 2016; Oya et al.
2016, 2017; Lindberg et al. 2016; Lee et al. 2017; Higuchi et al. 2018; Lefloch et al. 2018).
The relation between physical and chemical diversities and environment has attracted broad
attention in astrochemistry, astrophysics, and planetary science. To assess this problem, it
is important to study physical and chemical structures of protostars in various evolutionary
stages and environments.
Elias 29 (WL 15) is a Class I protostar in the L1688 dark cloud in Ophiuchus (Elias
1978; Wilking & Lada 1983), whose distance is 137 pc (Ortiz-León et al. 2017). The
bolometric temperature and bolometric luminosity are reported to be 391 K and 13.6 L
(Miotello et al. 2014), respectively. This source is surrounded by a number of young stellar
objects, such as WL 16, WL 17, WL19, and WL20. Moreover, its parent cloud (L1688) is
strongly illuminated by the B2 V star HD147889 and is a typical photodissociation region
(Yui et al. 1993; Liseau et al. 1999; Ebisawa et al. 2015; Rocha & Pilling 2018). Specifically,
Elias 29 is located at ∼ 70000 (∼ 0.5 pc) from HD147889 in the plane of the sky.
Because Elias 29 is a bright infrared source, infrared spectroscopic observations have
been conducted on its gas and dust components. Boogert et al. (2000) observed Elias 29
with the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) and found that CO mainly exists as a gas,
while CO2 is in the solid phase. They concluded that gas and dust around the protostar
are significantly heated by external/internal radiation. Recently, Rocha & Pilling (2018)

–5–
showed, on the basis of a radiative transfer calculation, that the dust temperature of
this protostellar core is mostly higher than 20 K owing to external irradiation, especially
from HD147889. Because the desorption temperature of CO is about 20 K, their result
is consistent with the ISO observation. Elias 29 is also an X-ray emitter (Imanishi et al.
2001; Favata et al. 2005; Giardino et al. 2007). The effect of high-energy cosmic rays on the
chemical composition of gas and dust of Elias 29 is discussed by Rocha & Pilling (2015).
Molecular outflows from Elias 29 have extensively been studied by Bontemps et al.
(1996), Sekimoto et al. (1997), Ceccarelli et al. (2002), Bussmann et al. (2007), Nakamura
et al. (2011), and van der Marel et al. (2013). According to the CO (J = 6 − 5) observation
performed by Ceccarelli et al. (2002) at a resolution of 1200 with the James Clark Maxwell
Telescope (JCMT), the outflow of Elias 29 is along the east-west direction, where the
eastern and western lobes are red-shifted and blue-shifted, respectively. Bussmann et al.
(2007) conducted the CO (J = 3 − 2) observation with the Heinrich Hertz Submillimeter
Telescope (HHT) and found that the outflow of this source has an inverse S shape that lies
along the east-west direction near the protostar and along the north-south direction at a
distance of 10000 au from the protostar. The direction of the outflow near the protostar
is consistent with the observations of Ceccarelli et al. (2002). Meanwhile, Bussmann et
al. (2007) and Nakamura et al. (2011) showed that the large-scale outflow of Elias 29 is
complex owing to outflow contributions of nearby young stellar objects. van der Marel et
al. (2013) conducted a CO (J = 3 − 2) observation with the JCMT and found an outflow
shape consistent with that reported by Bussmann et al. (2007). In addition to the molecular
outflow, a jet launched from the protostar toward the east-west direction was detected in
near-infrared H2 emission (Gómez et al. 2003; Ybarra et al. 2006).
The distribution of the dense gas around the protostar is delineated by Boogert et
al. (2002), Lommen et al. (2008), Jørgensen et al. (2009), and van Kempen et al. (2009).

–6–
With the Submillimeter Array (SMA), Lommen et al. (2008) found a compact component
associated with the protostar in HCO+ (J = 3 − 2) emission at a resolution of 4.00 0 × 2.00 3.
Their observation also revealed a ridge component extending along the east-west direction
at 400 (∼ 500 au) south of the protostar. They estimated the protostellar mass to be
2.5 ± 0.6 M by assuming Keplerian rotation, where the inclination of the disk/envelope
system was assumed to be 30◦ (0◦ for a face-on configuration). However, the disk/envelope
structure has not been well characterized because of poor angular resolution and sensitivity.
Moreover, the chemical composition in the protostar vicinity has not been investigated yet.
Here we report the physical and chemical structures of the disk/envelope system at
subarcsecond resolution with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA).
This work is a part of our comparative study of five young low-mass protostellar sources
(TMC–1A, B335, NGC1333 IRAS 4A, L483, and Elias 29) (Sakai et al. 2016; Imai et al.
2016; López-Sepulcre et al. 2017; Oya et al. 2017, and this work).

Observations

The ALMA observations of Elias 29 were carried out on 2015 May 18 with 37 antennas
during the Cycle 2 operation. Spectral lines of CS, SO,

34

SO, SO2 , and SiO were observed

with the Band 6 receiver, and the basic parameters of the observations are listed in Table
1. The baselines ranged from 15.1 m to 519.8 m. The field center of the observations was
(α2000 , δ2000 ) = (16h 27m 09.s 44, −24◦ 370 19.00 99), and the primary beam size (FWHM) was
23.00 03. The total on-source time was 22.27 minutes. The typical system temperature was
from 70 to 120 K. Sixteen spectral windows were observed with a backend correlator tuned
to a resolution of 61.035 kHz (0.073 km s−1 at 250 GHz), and the bandwidth of each window
was 58.5938 MHz. J1517–2422 was used for the bandpass calibration, while J1625–2527 was
used for the phase calibration every 7 minutes. An absolute flux density scale was derived

–7–
from Titan. The absolute accuracy of the flux calibration was 10% for Band 6 (Lundgren
2013). Self-calibration was not applied, for simplicity.
Images were obtained with the CLEAN algorithm using Briggs weighting with a robust
parameter of 0.5. A 1.2 mm continuum image was obtained by averaging line-free channels.
The line maps were obtained after subtracting the continuum component directly from the
visibility data by resampling to make the channel width 0.5 km s−1 for

34

SO and SiO or 0.1

km s−1 for the other molecular transitions. The synthesized beam sizes for the spectral lines
are listed in Table 1. The root-mean-square (rms) noise level was 0.3 mJy beam−1 for the
continuum and 7, 7, 4, 6, and 4 mJy beam−1 for CS, SO,

34

SO, SO2 , and SiO, respectively,

for the channel width mentioned above. A primary beam correction was applied for the
continuum and line maps (see Figure 1(a)).

Results: Spectral Distribution
1.2 mm Continuum Emission

Figure 1(a) shows the continuum emission at 1.2 mm. The storing beam is
0.00 856 × 0.00 470 (P.A. 95.◦ 17). The peak position of the continuum emission was determined
to be (α2000 , δ2000 ) = (16h 27m 09.s 4358 ± 0.0007, −24◦ 370 19.00 286 ± 0.004), by using twodimensional Gaussian fitting. The image component sizes convolved with and deconvolved
from the beam are (0.00 8845 ± 0.00 0216) × (0.00 5632 ± 0.00 0092) (∼ 120 × 80 au) (Position Angle
(P.A.) 96.◦ 0 ± 1.◦ 4) and (0.00 312 ± 0.00 033) × (0.00 220 ± 0.00 134) (∼ 40 × 30 au) (P.A. 177◦ ± 57◦ ),
respectively. Thus, the continuum emission is marginally resolved by the storing beam.
Two-dimensional Gaussian fitting of the continuum emission yields a peak intensity
I(ν) and integrated flux F (ν) of (17.2 ± 0.3) mJy beam−1 and (21.4 ± 0.7) mJy, respectively,
where the errors represent three standard deviations (3σ) of the fit. The beam-averaged

–8–
column density of H2 (N (H2 )) is obtained from the following equation (Ward-Thompson et
al. 2000):

where κν is the mass absorption coefficient with respect to the dust mass, m is the average
mass of a particle in the gas (3.83 × 10−24 g), ν is the frequency, θmajor and θminor are
the major and minor beam sizes, respectively, T is the dust temperature, and Rd is the
dust-to-gas mass ratio (0.01). According to Ossenkopf & Henning (1994), κν is estimated
to be 1.3 cm2 g−1 at a wavelength of 1.2 mm by interpolation. In this study, we chose
the dust opacity model appropriate for dense regions (108 cm−3 ) with the MRN grain
size distributions (Mathis et al. 1977). The resulting N (H2 ) and gas mass are shown in
Table 2. Because Elias 29 is a relatively evolved source, the dust mass opacity at 1.2
mm could be higher than the typical value for young stellar objects owing to a larger
dust size. If we assume β = 1.0 (Miotello et al. 2014), κν is estimated to be 2.5 cm2 g−1
β

(κν × Rd = 0.1 × (ν/(1012 Hz)) ; Beckwith et al. 1990), and N (H2 ) and gas mass would be
smaller by a factor of 2. In the following discussion, we use the former results with κν = 1.3
cm2 g−1 .
The peak intensity (17.2 mJy beam−1 ) corresponds to a brightness temperature of 0.8
K with the storing beam size. When we use the image size deconvolved from the beam to
compensate for beam dilution, the brightness temperature is 4.7 K. Rocha & Pilling (2018)
reported the distribution of the dust temperature. According to their model, the dust
temperature is about 70 K at a distance of 40 au from the protostar. With these values, the
beam-averaged optical depth of the dust continuum is estimated to be 0.07.

Molecular Lines

Figure 1 shows the integrated intensity maps of the CS, SO,

34

SO, SO2 , and SiO lines.

The velocity range for the integration is −20 to 30 km s−1 , where the systemic velocity (vsys )
is 4.0 km s−1 . Figure 2 shows the blowup of each panel in Figure 1 around the continuum
peak, whose area is indicated by the white dashed rectangle in Figure 1(a). Figure 3 shows
spectrum of each transition around the continuum peak. The peak integrated intensities
of the molecular emission are obtained by using two-dimensional Gaussian fitting to their
integrated intensity maps (Table 3).

3.2.1.
The SO,

34

SO, SO2 , and SiO

SO, SO2 , and SiO emissions show a point source at the continuum peak

position. Two-dimensional Gaussian fitting shows the position of the SO intensity peak to
be (α2000 , δ2000 ) = (16h 27m 09.s 4379 ± 0.0008, −24◦ 370 19.00 30 ± 0.01). The image component
sizes (FWHM) of the SO emission convolved with and deconvolved from the beam are
∼ 1.00 0 × 0.00 7 (∼ 120 au × 90 au) (P.A. 121.◦ 5 ± 5.◦ 5) and ∼ 0.00 7 × 0.00 3 (∼ 90 au × 40 au) (P.A.
158◦ ± 11◦ ), respectively.
The intensity ratio 32 SO/34 SO is found to be 13 ± 4 from the peak integrated intensities
(Table 3). Because the

32

S/34 S ratio in the Solar neighborhood is about 22.6, the

is likely optically thick. The optical depth of

32

32

SO line

SO is indeed estimated to be 2.33, including

the correction for the different Sµ2 values of the two lines. Here, we neglect the small
difference in their upper-state energies, because they are close to each other (47.6 and 49.9
K; Table 1).
In determining the column densities and fractional abundances of SO and 34 SO relative
to H2 , we assume local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), as shown in Table 3. We

– 10 –
determine the column density and fractional abundance of
emission, and determine those of SO from the

34

34

SO by assuming optically thin

SO results by using

32

S/34 S ratio of 22.6.

The SO2 emission is intense around the protostar, while the SiO emission is marginally
detected with a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of ∼ 5 (Figure 2). The column densities and
fractional abundances of SO2 and SiO are calculated under the same assumption as in the
34

SO case (Table 3).
The SO emission is also seen on the southeastern side of the continuum peak with an

angular offset of about 400 (∼500 au). This component has an intensity peak position of:
(α2000 , δ2000 ) = (16h 27m 09.s 489 ± 0.005, −24◦ 370 23.00 48 ± 0.05). Its image component size is
∼ 2.00 2 × 1.00 5 (∼ 300 au × 200 au). In addition, the

34

SO and SO2 emissions are marginally

seen around this position. This component could be due to a local density enhancement
(see Section 3.2.2), as previously reported (Lommen et al. 2008). The SO and SO2 column
densities are obtained from their emissions by assuming LTE and optically thin condition
(Table 4). We assume a gas temperature of 20 K at this position, according to the dust
temperature reported by Rocha & Pilling (2018); the dust temperature is about 25 K at a
distance of 500 au from the protostar.

3.2.2.

CS

In contrast to the molecular emission described in the previous subsection, the CS
emission is weak and marginally detected at the continuum peak position (Figure 2(b)).
The faint emission of CS is also confirmed by its spectrum (Figure 3), which shows a weak
absorption feature with a narrow line width at a velocity of ∼5.5 km s−1 probably due to
foreground gas. The results for column density and fractional abundance of CS toward the
continuum peak are listed in Table 3. They might be underestimates owing to the marginal

– 11 –
absorption in the red-shifted component. Nevertheless, CS is obviously deficient in the gas
near the protostar in comparison with SO.
On the other hand, the CS emission is rather intense in the ridge component on the
southeastern side (Figure 1(b)). This component traced by CS extends over 500 (∼600
au) along the northeast-southwest direction (Figure 1(b)). The CS column density of this
component is determined in the same way as for SO and SO2 (see Section 3.2.1). The
results are shown in Table 4.

3.3.

Abundance Ratios of the S-bearing Species

Table 4 lists the results for CS, SO, and SO2 abundance ratios. We have quantitatively
confirmed that CS is much less abundant than SO and SO2 at the continuum peak position.
We hereafter assume a gas temperature of 100 K for the continuum peak, based on the dust
temperature distribution reported by Rocha & Pilling (2018).
Table 4 also shows previously reported results for comparison: the shocked outflow
in L1157 (L1157 B1; Bachiller & Pérez Gutiérrez 1997), the protostar and the outflow
of NGC1333 IRAS 2 (Wakelam et al. 2005), and the envelope gas of the low-mass
protostellar source IRAS 16293–2422 Source B (Drozdovskaya et al. 2018). In low-mass
protostellar sources, SO is generally thought to be abundant in shocked regions. Indeed,
the N (SO)/N (CS) ratio in L1157 B1 is higher than that in IRAS 16293–2422 Source B by
more than one order of magnitude. The results in NGC 1333 IRAS 2 show a large variation
in this abundance ratio, which tends to be high in the shocked gas of the eastern outflow
lobe (Wakelam et al. 2005). Nevertheless, Elias 29 obviously shows a higher N (SO)/N (CS)
ratio than these sources, although the error is large; the ratio in Elias 29 is higher than that
in L1157 B1 by a factor of ∼200 and higher than the highest ratio in the shocked gas in

– 12 –
NGC 1333 IRAS 2 by a factor of 7.
As shown in Table 4, N (SO2 )/N (CS) is also higher in the shocked region of L1157 B1
than in IRAS 16293–2422 Source B. As in the case of N (SO)/N (CS), the N (SO2 )/N (CS)
ratio in Elias 29 is higher than in the other sources by two orders of magnitude.
These results suggest that Elias 29 is significantly richer in SO and SO2 than in CS.
Such a peculiar chemical characteristic is also reported for the low-mass Class I source
LFAM 1 (or GSS 30 IRS 3) by Reboussin et al. (2015); that source shows strong emissions
of SO, SO2 , and SO+ . LFAM 1 is also located in the ρ Ophiuchi star-forming region and
has strong radio emission at 6 cm (Leous et al. 1991). Reboussin et al. (2015) interpreted
their observations as shock chemistry caused by an outflow from this Class I source or from
a nearby young stellar object. However, the SO and SO2 emissions in Elias 29 are clearly
associated with the protostar, although we cannot rule out a contribution from the outflow
shock near the launching point.
The column densities listed in Table 3 are beam-averaged. As mentioned in Section
3.2, the compact emission concentrated at the continuum peak is only marginally resolved.
Thus, the calculated column densities may be underestimates and could be affected by
different beam dilutions among the molecules. If the CS emission is more diluted than that
of SO or SO2 , the N (SO)/N (CS) and N (SO2 )/N (CS) ratios could be overestimated at the
CS peak. Observations at higher resolution are required to study such small-scale variation
(on size scales of a few 10s of au).
Table 4 also shows the molecular abundances of CS, SO, and SO2 and their relative
abundance ratios in the ridge component of Elias 29. In the ridge, CS seems to be more
abundant than at the continuum peak, as shown in Figures 1 and 2. The SO emission is
clearly detected in the ridge as well, while the SO2 emission is marginally detected with a
peak intensity of about the 3σ confidence level. The N (SO)/N (CS) and N (SO2 )/N (CS)

– 13 –
ratios are lower than those at the continuum peak by a factor of 5 to 8, although they are
still high compared with those of the low-mass protostellar source IRAS 16293–2422 Source
B (Drozdovskaya et al. 2018).

4.

Chemical Inventory

As discussed above, Elias 29 is rich in SO and SO2 , while deficient in CS. Furthermore,
Elias 29 is deficient in saturated organic molecules. Figures 4 and 5 show the integrated
intensity maps and spectra of the HCOOCH3 (205,16 –195,15 ; E), CH3 OCH3 (135,8 –134,9 ;
EE, AA), CCH (N =3–2, J=5/2–3/2, F =3–2, 2–1), and c-C3 H2 (52,3 –43,2 ) lines toward the
protostar. These molecular lines are not detected in our observation.
For comparison, Figure 5 shows the spectra observed toward NGC1333 IRAS 4A2 with
ALMA (López-Sepulcre et al. 2017). IRAS 4A is a binary system consisting of IRAS 4A1
and IRAS 4A2, where IRAS 4A2 is a hot corino and is chemically richer than IRAS 4A1.
In IRAS 4A2, the organic molecular lines HCOOCH3 , CH3 OCH3 , CCH, and c-C3 H2 are all
clearly detected, in contrast with the Elias 29 case, although the observational sensitivity is
almost the same for the two sources.

4.1.

Deficiency in Organic Molecules

We here derive the upper limits to the column densities of the above molecules.
The upper limits to the column densities of HCOOCH3 , CH3 OCH3 , CCH, and c-C3 H2 ,
are determined from the rms noise levels of their integrated intensity maps in Figure
4, as summarized in Table 5. These upper limits are compared with the corresponding
fractional abundances or their upper limits reported for NGC1333 IRAS 4A1 and A2 by
López-Sepulcre et al. (2017) (Table 5). the upper limits to the abundances of these molecules

– 14 –
in Elias 29 are lower than those in NGC1333 IRAS 4A2 by one order of magnitude, while
the constraints for the fractional abundances in Elias 29 are looser than those in NGC 1333
IRAS 4A1.
Because the emissions from saturated organic molecules are expected to originate
from the hot (> 100 K) region near the protostar, they could be weak if the hot region is
small. This possibility is suggested for NGC1333 IRAS 4A1 (López-Sepulcre et al. 2017).
However, this is not the case for Elias 29; according to Boogert et al. (2000), the H2 O gas,
which is expected to reside in the hot (> 100 K) region, was detected in absorption in this
source by ISO, with a column density of ∼ 1018 cm−2 . This corresponds to a high fractional
ratio of 10−5 relative to the total hydrogen column density (NH ∼ 1023 cm−2 ). According
to Boogert et al. (2000), Elias 29 should have a hot region where various saturated organic
molecules are liberated. They also reported the size of the hot core to be (85 − 225) au
based on observations of infrared absorption of high-J vibration-rotation lines of CO. This
size can be resolved in our observation with our beam size ∼ 100 au). Furthermore, the
dust temperature is above 100 K within ∼ 50 au of the protostar according to Rocha &
Pilling (2018). Therefore, the non-detection of COM lines in our observations is not due to
their being frozen-out; instead, it is likely that Elias 29 is very poor in COMs.
The integrated intensity map of the CCH line (Figure 4c) shows a slight negative
intensity with a minimum value of −91 mJy beam−1 km s−1 (∼6σ) around the protostar,
This feature is likely due to self-absorption by foreground gas containing CCH. The
extended ambient gas would be resolved-out in this observation with the interferometer,
whose maximum recoverable size is ∼600 . Nevertheless, no enhancement of the HCOOCH3 ,
CH3 OCH3 , CCH, or c-C3 H2 emission is confirmed at least near the protostar, in contrast to
the SO and SO2 cases.

4.2.

Possible Cause for the Chemical Characteristics of Elias 29

As described above, one of the interesting chemical features of Elias 29 is its deficiency
of organic molecules as well as its richness in SO and SO2 . Here we discuss the following
two possibilities: an evolutionary effect after the protostellar birth and an environmental
effect. Distinguishing between these alternatives is left for future study.
Elias 29 is a Class I protostar with a bolometric temperature of 391 K (Miotello et al.
2014). Hence, the disk component would have already experienced a temperature above that
corresponding to the sublimation of COMS, given the age of this protostar ((1 − 5) × 105
yr after the onset of gravitational collapse; Chen et al. 1995). After sublimation, COMs
are destroyed by proton transfer reactions with HCO+ , H3 O+ , and other ions followed by
electron recombination reactions. According to the hot-core model proposed by Nomura &
Millar (2004), the time scale for the destruction is about 105 yr, which is comparable to
the age of the Elias 29 protostar. In this case, the organic molecules liberated from dust
grains at the birth of the protostar would have already been broken up by gas reactions.
If most of the infalling envelope has already dissipated, fresh grains with COM-ice are no
longer supplied. In this case, COMs would be deficient near the protostar. As for the
sulfur-bearing molecules, SO and SO2 can be abundant while CS can be deficient in the
gas of an evolved source. SO and SO2 are the most abundant sulfur-bearing molecules in
the gas when the chemical composition of the gas is in a steady state. Thus, the relative
maturity of Elias 29 can explain its chemical characteristics. To test this hypothesis, it is
necessary to observe other evolved protostellar sources at high spatial resolution and to
confirm the dissipation of the envelope gas, which is resolved out in the present observation.
Alternatively, both the deficiency of organic molecules and the richness in SO and SO2
in Elias 29 could be attributed to the relatively high temperature of the parent core in the
starless-core phase due to external heating by nearby objects. These objects include YSOs

– 16 –
that are only about 30 from Elias 29, as well as two bright B stars (S1 and HD147889)
(Yui et al. 1993; Ebisawa et al. 2015; Rocha & Pilling 2018). As mentioned in Section 1,
a warm parent core is consistent with the infrared observations of CO and CO2 (Boogert
et al. 2000). It is generally thought that saturated organic molecules, such as CH3 OH and
HCOOCH3 , are produced on dust grains by hydrogenation of CO and liberated into the gas
near the protostar. It has also been proposed that saturated organic molecules are produced
in the gas from CH3 OH liberated from dust grains (Balucani et al. 2015). Meanwhile, it has
been suggested that unsaturated carbon-chain molecules and related species, such as CCH
and c-C3 H2 , are efficiently produced from methane (CH4 ) via sa gas-phase reaction (Sakai
& Yamamoto 2013). CH4 is the precursor of unsaturated carbon chains and is mainly
formed by hydrogenation of atomic carbon on dust grains. Therefore, depletion of either
CO or atomic carbon onto dust grains in the prestellar-core stage is required for enhanced
production of saturated and unsaturated organic molecules in the protostellar core. Both
CO and atomic carbon are depleted onto dust grains with temperatures lower than 20 K
(see Appendix A).
As mentioned in Section 1, the dust temperature of the protostellar core Elias 29 is
mostly higher than 20 K even on the scale of a few thousand au according to Rocha &
Pilling (2018). If the dust temperature were as high as 20 K in the parent cloud of Elias
29 in the past as it is now, CO and atomic carbon would hardly be adsorbed onto dust
grains. This may result in insufficient production of the above organic molecules. If this is
the case, the deuterium fractionation ratio, which increases after CO depletion onto dust
grains, is expected to stay low (e.g. Caselli et al. 2002; Bacmann et al. 2003; Crapsi et al.
2005), although evolutionary effects should also be considered (Imai et al. 2018).
Under the above temperature condition, sulfur atoms will not be depleted onto dust
grains either, because the desorption temperature of sulfur atoms is comparable to those

– 17 –
of CO and atomic carbon (KIDA; Wakelam et al. 2012, Appendix A). In this case, sulfur
atoms are converted to SO and SO2 through gas-phase reactions (e.g. Prasad & Huntress
1982; Charnley 1997; Yoneda et al. 2016; Wakelam et al. 2011). High N (SO)/N (CS) and
N (SO2 )/N (CS) ratios are expected if the elemental C/O ratio is > 1, which is plausible
considering the detection of water vapor.
Similar chemical characteristics are reported for two other sources: the massive
star-forming region G5.89–0.39 and the nearby low-metallicity Large Magellanic Cloud
(LMC). G5.89–0.39 consists of shock-heated gas (150 − 1800 K) based on interpretation of
CO observations with the SMA tracing the outflows (Su et al. 2012). This source has intense
SO and SO2 line emissions observed by Thompson & MacDonald (1999) with the JCMT
and by Hunter et al. (2008) with the SMA. Hunter et al. (2008) also found relatively weak
CH3 OH line emission and suggested, as a possible cause, that CO is not well adsorbed onto
dust grains. In the high-mass star-forming core ST11 in the LMC, an ALMA observation
by Shimonishi et al. (2016) shows bright SO and SO2 and weak CH3 OH line emissions.
While the low metallicity in the LMC (e.g., Dufour et al. 1982) should partly contribute to
the low CH3 OH abundance, Shimonishi et al. (2016) suggest that the CH3 OH production
is suppressed by warm ice chemistry at the molecular cloud stage. This is supported by a
chemical model (Acharyya & Herbst 2018). We note that CS is less abundant in ST11 than
in hot cores in the Milky Way, which is similar to the Elias 29 case. Elias 29 has low mass,
while the above sources are massive. However, their similar chemical characteristics could
be interpreted in terms of the same scenario with a relatively high dust temperature during
the prestellar core phase discussed above.
In this regard, one might conclude that warm core temperatures are common even for
high-mass star-forming regions harboring hot cores rich in COMs. However, this does not
necessarily contradict the above discussion. A key factor in insufficient COM production

– 18 –
on dust surfaces is not the dust temperature at the current protostellar core phase but the
temperature during the prestellar phase. Therefore, high-mass star-forming regions rich in
COMs can occur if their dust temperature in the prestellar core phase was cold enough for
CO depletion and then rose to the current level after the protostellar birth.

Rotation Traced by SO

Figure 6(a) shows the velocity map (the moment 1 map) of the SO (67 − 56 ) line. It
reveals a clear velocity gradient along the north-south direction across the continuum peak.
This gradient is almost perpendicular to the outflow axis, which was previously reported
as running along the east-west direction near the protostar (Ceccarelli et al. 2002). Thus,
the gradient most likely represents rotation. Considering its compact distribution, the
SO emission seems to trace the disk/envelope system in the vicinity of the protostar. A
similar velocity gradient around the protostar is also seen in the SO2 (103,7 − 102,8 ) emission
(Figure 6b). The SO line has a faint blue-shifted component at a distance of 300 (∼ 400 au)
north of the protostar, which may come from part of the gas rotating around the protostar.
This velocity structure is consistent with the observation of HCO+ (J = 3 − 2) reported
by Lommen et al. (2008). Meanwhile, no clear velocity shift is seen in the SO emission
in the ridge component. This component has a large velocity range of (3 − 8) km s−1 (a
velocity-shift range of (−1 − +4) km s−1 with respect to the systemic velocity of Elias
29), which cannot be attributed to rotation around the protostar. Alternatively, the ridge
may come from a gas component in the complex geometrical system surrounding Elias 29
(Boogert et al. 2002).
Figure 6(c) shows the integrated intensity maps of the high velocity-shift components
of the SO emission. The velocity ranges for the integration are −0.5 to 0.0 km
s−1 and 10.0 to 10.5 km s−1 for the blue- and red-shifted components, respectively.

– 19 –
Two-dimensional Gaussian fitting yields the intensity peak positions (α2000 , δ2000 ) =
(16h 27m 09.s 4353 ± 0.0011, −24◦ 370 19.00 145 ± 0.013) and (α2000 , δ2000 ) = (16h 27m 09.s 4343 ±
0.0008, −24◦ 370 19.00 419 ± 0.004) for the blue- and red-shifted components, respectively.
Although the separation (∼0.00 3; ∼30 au) is marginal, these peaks are on opposite sides of
the continuum peak. Moreover, they align almost on a common line with the P.A. of ∼0◦ .
On the basis of this result, we define the P.A. of the mid-plane of the disk/envelope system
to be 0◦ , which means the P.A. of the rotation axis is 270◦ .
The image component size of the integrated intensity map of the SO line deconvolved
from the storing beam is ∼ 0.00 7 × 0.00 3 (∼ 100 × 40 au) (P.A. 158◦ ± 11◦ ) (see Section 3.2.1).
If we assume a flat disk with no thickness, i is estimated to be 65◦ . When the thickness of
the disk is considered, this value is regarded as the lower limit. This result is in contrast to
the inclination angle of less than 60◦ reported by Boogert et al. (2002) on the basis of a flat
spectral energy distribution (SED). However, the analysis of the SED could be affected by
gas in the foreground of Elias 29 (e.g. Boogert et al. 2002; Rocha & Pilling 2018), and thus
our result does not seriously conflict with their estimate. For a further constraint, detailed
analysis of the outflow will be helpful.

5.1.

Kinematic Structure around the Protostar

Figure 7 shows position-velocity (PV) diagrams of the SO line. The position axes are
centered at the continuum peak position. The P.A.s of the position axes are taken for every
30◦ and are shown in Figure 2(c); Figure 7(a) shows the PV diagram along the mid-plane
of the disk/envelope system (P.A. 0◦ ), while Figure 7(d) is along the line perpendicular to
it (P.A. 90◦ ).
Figure 7(a) shows a bar-like feature with a clear velocity gradient across the continuum

– 20 –
peak; the SO emission is blue- and red-shifted on the northern and southern sides of the
continuum peak, respectively. This velocity gradient corresponds to that in Figure 6. The
velocity gradient becomes less clear as the P.A. of the position axis increases from 0◦ to 90◦ ,
and it is hardly seen in Figure 7(d) (P.A. 90◦ ). In the PV diagrams with a P.A. greater
than 90◦ (Figures 7(e) and (f)), the velocity gradient is confirmed again; the emissions on
the northwestern and southeastern sides of the continuum peak are blue- and red-shifted,
respectively. These features are most likely attributed to rotation along the north-south
direction without significant infall motion.
Figure 8 shows the PV diagrams of the

34

SO, SO2 , and SiO lines. The S/N ratio is

worse for these lines than for the SO line. Nevertheless, the velocity gradient along the
north-south direction is as clear in the SO2 emission (Figure 8c), as in the SO emission. It
is difficult to confirm the velocity gradient in the

34

SO and SiO emissions because of their

insufficient S/N ratios, although a similar velocity-gradient is marginally seen in the SiO
emission. Moreover, the red-shifted components look more intense than the blue-shifted
components in the SO and SO2 emissions, and maybe also in the

34

SO emission. This is

discussed below in Section 5.3.

5.2.

Analysis of Rotation

In this section, we discuss the rotation around the protostar found in the SO and SO2
lines. Because the rotational structure is marginally resolved as shown in Figures 6 and 7,
it is difficult to distinguish between Keplerian motion and infall-rotation. Although a clear
infall motion is not apparently seen in the PV diagram (Figure 7), we cannot exclude the
existence of infall at the current stage. Moreover, the SO and SO2 spectra do not show the
symmetric double-peak characteristic of Keplerian motion (e.g. Eracleous & Halpern 1994;
Dutrey et al. 1997; Öberg et al. 2015; Kastner et al. 2018; Imai et al. 2019), which suggests

– 21 –
a contribution from infall. Observations at higher angular resolution are thus necessary to
determine the kinematics of the disk/envelope structure, including the disk size and the
protostellar mass, accurately. Nonetheless, it is worthwhile to estimate the protostellar
mass on the basis of the rotational structure observed in our study. For this purpose, we
hereafter assume that the observed rotation is Keplerian, for simplicity.
Figure 9 shows the PV diagrams simulated by using the Keplerian disk model
(contours); the simulated diagrams are superposed on those of the observed SO emission
(color). We use a proportionality coefficient of r−2.0 for the emissivity, including the effects
of the molecular abundance and temperature profiles, where r denotes the distance from
the protostar. In this model, we ignore radiative transfer for simplicity. Thus, the simulated
intensity distribution is not accurate enough for detailed comparison with the observation
owing to systematic errors. Nevertheless, this simplified model is useful, as found for other
sources (e.g. Oya et al. 2017; Okoda et al. 2018), if we focus on the velocity profiles in the
comparison. The emission in the model is convolved with the storing beam in the observed
SO line.
In Figure 9, the following parameters are used for the Keplerian disk model: the
protostellar mass is 1.0 M , the inclination angle of the disk/envelope system is 65◦ (0◦ for
a face-on configuration), and the mid-plane of the disk is extended along a P.A. of 0◦ . The
emission is assumed to come from the compact region around the protostar with a radius
of 100 au. This model seems to roughly explain the observed velocity structure, namely,
the velocity gradient in the PV diagrams of the SO line. When the inclination angle i is
considered explicitly, the protostellar mass is given by
M = 0.82 M ×

1
,
sin2 i

(2)

where i = 0 for a face-on configuration. For instance, the upper limit of M could be 1.0
M for the lower limit of i (65◦ ; Section 5), while the lower limit could be 0.82 M for

– 22 –
the completely edge-on case (i = 90◦ ). Although these values are not contradict with the
lower limit of 0.62 M reported by Lommen et al. (2008) on the basis of their 1.1 mm
SMA data of the HCO+ (J = 3 − 2) line at a resolution of 4.00 0 × 2.00 3, assuming the edge-on
configuration, the values are lower than those previously employed by a factor of a few;
for example, Lommen et al. (2008) reported 2.5 ± 0.6 M for an inclination angle of 30◦ ,
whereas Miotello et al. (2014) reported 3 M using a continuum model. Our result is based
on the kinematic structure observed at much higher angular resolution than in the previous
studies and provides a better estimate. If the protostellar mass is as small as ≤ 1.0 M ,
the protostellar age (a few 105 yr; Lommen et al. 2008) would be estimated to be younger
by a factor of a few. The discrepancy between previous studies and ours is mainly due to
the different inclination angle assumed. Indeed, the protostellar mass could be calculated
to be 3.3 M with the equation (2), if the inclination angle is 30◦ as assumed by Lommen
et al. (2008). A tighter constraint on the protostellar mass and the inclination angle would
require higher angular resolution.
We note that our estimate of the protostellar mass can vary by a factor of a few when
we consider possible infall motion. For instance, if we used the infalling-rotating envelope,
the protostellar mass would be half of that estimated above via the pure Keplerian model
(See Appendix B).

5.3.

Asymmetric Spectral Line Profiles of the SO2 emission

In Figure 3, the SO, SO2 , and SiO lines show a large velocity width over 20 km s−1 .
The high-velocity components likely come from the rotating gas in the vicinity of the
protostar. The shapes of the spectral profiles are different from one another; the SO and
SiO emissions each have a single peak near the systemic velocity (vsys ∼ 4.0 km s−1 ), while
the SO2 emission is flatter over a velocity shift of 5 km s−1 .

– 23 –
The spectral profile of the SO2 emission is asymmetric with respect to the systemic
velocity (Figure 3). More specifically, the red-shifted part is brighter than the blue-shifted
component. This is confirmed in the PV diagrams (Figure 8), as discussed in Section 5.1.
Two-dimensional Gaussian fitting of the integrated intensity maps of SO2 yields blueand red-shifted peaks of 329 ± 10 and 225 ± 9 mJy beam−1 with integration over the
velocity-shift ranges −4 to +4 km s−1 and +4 to +12 km s−1 , respectively, the difference
being a factor of 0.68.
A similar asymmetry has been reported for the Class 0 low-mass protostellar source
L483 on a scale of 100 au (CS, SO, HNCO, NH2 CHO, HCOOCH3 ; Oya et al. 2017). It is
suggested that this is due to the asymmetric distribution of these molecules, which could
be the case for SO2 in Elias 29 as well. We note, however, that the line profiles of Elias 29
and L483 are both red-shift deviated, while the asymmetry of a gas distribution should be
random, causing either a red-shift or blue-shift deviated profile in principle. In other words,
a red-shift deviated line profile could originate from a common physical reason relating to
the vicinity of the protostar. We now discuss the following two possibilities.
The weak blue-shifted emission could be explained if the dust in the vicinity of the
protostar were optically thick at the corresponding frequency. We consider an edge-on
configuration of the disk/envelope system where the molecular gas is infalling. Then, the
blue-shifted emission of molecular lines from the back side could be attenuated by dust.
The intensity of the blue-shifted emission would be attenuated by a factor of 0.93, if we
assumed an optical depth (τ ) of 0.07 for the dust (Section 3.1). This attenuation could not
explain the observed difference of a factor of 0.68 seen in the SO2 emission. Here, we note
that the above value for τ is an averaged value around the protostar, and hence, the optical
depth of the dust would be higher nearer to the protostar. For a thin disk with a constant
density with a radius of r and a scale height of d, the optical depth averaged in the circle

– 24 –
with a radius of r is smaller than the actual optical depth near the protostar by a factor of
d
. This is estimated from the volume between the thin disk and a cylinder with a radius
2r
of r and a height of 2r surrounding the disk. If the dust continuum emission came from a
thin-disk structure with a radius of 20 au and a height of 7 au, τ would be 0.4. If this were
the case and there were infall motion in the vicinity of the protostar, the absorption of the
blue-shifted emission by the dust would explain the observed intensity asymmetry in the
SO2 line.
Alternatively, the fact that the blue-shifted emission is weaker than the red-shifted
emission could be attributed to expansion. When the gas is expanding, the blue-shifted
emission from the gas in front of the protostar is reduced in comparison with the red-shifted
emission from the gas to the rear of the protostar (e.g., Beals 1953). In this case, reduction
in intensity occurs mainly for a low-velocity region; this reduction is due to the foreground
molecular gas, which has an excitation temperature lower than that of the gas near the
protostar. This could be the case in Elias 29 and L483 if the above molecular lines come
from the gas in an outflow or a disk wind near the protostar. However, we note that the
intensity of the high-velocity region (vshift ∼ −8 km s−1 ) seems to be reduced in Elias 29,
which is difficult to attribute to gas in the foreground of the expanding flow. Nevertheless,
the possibility that the asymmetry of the intensity due to an outflow or disk wind cannot
be excluded at this stage and should be further tested.

Summary

We have analyzed ALMA Cycle 2 data obtained for various molecular lines (Table 1)
from the Class I protostellar source Elias 29. The major findings are summarized below:

(1) The SO and SO2 lines are bright in the compact region around the protostar within

– 25 –
a region of diameter of a few 10s of au. The SO line also traces a ridge component
at a distance of 400 (∼500 au) from the protostar toward the south. SiO emission is
detected around the protostar. Meanwhile, the CS emission is weak at the protostar,
while it traces the southern ridge component. Around the protostar, the abundance
2
ratio SO/CS is as high as 3+13
−2 × 10 , which is even higher than that found in an

outflow shocked region (L1157 B1).
(2) Elias 29 is deficient in both saturated and unsaturated organic molecules, such as
HCOOCH3 , CH3 OCH3 , CCH, and c-C3 H2 . Their deficiency as well as the richness in
SO and SO2 can be explained qualitatively by chemical evolution of a Class I source
> 20 K) in the parent cloud of Elias 29 in
or by the relatively high dust temperature ( ∼
its prestellar core phase. Determining which of these two possibilities applies here is
left for future study.
(3) The SO and SO2 emissions show a velocity gradient along the north-south direction
across the protostar. Although the gradient is likely due to rotation around the
protostar, it is difficult to distinguish between Keplerian motion and infall-rotation
in our observation. If we assume this rotation to be Keplerian for simplicity, the
kinematic structure that we observed with the SO line can be reproduced by a
protostellar mass between 0.82 and 1.0 M by assuming an inclination angle of 90◦ to
65◦ (0◦ for a face-on configuration).
(4) The SO2 spectrum is asymmetric, with the blue-shifted components weaker than
the red-shifted. Although this asymmetry can be attributed to an inhomogeneous
molecular distribution, we need to consider other possible causes, such as dust opacity
or outflow motion.

A.

Desorption Temperature

The desorption temperature of a molecular species (also called sublimation
temperature) is the typical temperature at which the species thermally desorbs from
dust grains. According to Yamamoto (2017), the desorption temperature (Tdes ) can be
represented in terms of the balance between desorption and adsorption as:
−1

ν0
,
kB Tdes = Edes log
n0 Σ < v >

(A1)

where Edes denotes the desorption energy (or binding energy) of molecule X, ν0 the
characteristic frequency of the vibration mode, n0 the number density of H nuclei, Σ
the effective collision area of dust per H molecule, and < v > the average speed of X.
Typical values for ν0 and Σ are 1012 Hz and 10−22 cm2 , respectively (Hasegawa et al. 1992;
Yamamoto 2017).

– 27 –
Here, the desorption temperature of X is proportional to its desorption energy. Figure
10 shows the relation between the desorption temperature and the desorption energy with
typical values for n0 and < v >. From the plots, the proportionality factor of Tdes to Edes
is approximately (50 − 60), which weakly depends on n0 , ν0 , Σ, and < v >. Although
Tdes tends to be higher for higher n0 , this proportionality relation is practically useful for
estimating Tdes . By assuming the factor to be 55 (n0 of 108 cm−2 and < v > of 0.1 km s−1 ),
we can estimate the desorption temperatures of the molecular species in this study as well
as some representative molecular species, as summarized in Table 6.

Protostellar Mass Estimation with Keplerian Motion and with Combined
Infall and Rotation
In Keplerian motion, the rotational velocity (vrot ) of the gas around the protostar is

represented as:
r
vrot (r) =

GM
,
r

(B1)

where M denotes the mass of the central protostar and r the radial distance from the
protostar. On the other hand, the gas motion can be a combination of infall and rotation.
If ballistic motion is assumed, the rotational velocity (vrot ) and infall velocity (vfall ) are
represented as(Oya et al. 2014):
1p
2GM rCB ,
r
1p
vfall (r) =
2GM (r − rCB ),
r
vrot (r) =

(B2)
(B3)

where rCB denotes the radius of the centrifugal barrier, which is the perihelion for the
infalling gas. At the centrifugal barrier, the gas only rotates, without any radial motion.
When we measure vrot at a certain position at a distance r from the protostar, we can
1

estimate the protostellar mass (M ) to be rCB vrot
by using equation (B1) for Keplerian
G

motion. For a combination of infall and rotation, we need to specify rCB . When we simply
assume that the position is the centrifugal barrier, the protostellar mass is calculated to
1
2
be
rCB vrot
with Equation (B2). This is half of the mass derived by assuming Keplerian
2G
motion.

line. The contour levels are at intervals of 3σ starting from 3σ, where the rms levels are
5, 5, 7, and 9 mJy beam−1 km s−1 for the HCOOCH3 , CH3 OCH3 , CCH, and c-C3 H2 lines,

Fig. 9.— Position-velocity diagrams of the SO (67 − 56 ; color) line in Figure 7 are compared
with the result of the Keplerian disk model (black contours). The position axes are the
same as those in Figure 7. The white dashed lines represent a systemic velocity of 4.0 km
s−1 . We assume a protostellar mass of 1.0 M and inclination angle of 65◦ (0◦ for a face-on
configuration) for the disk/envelope system. In addition, the emission is assumed to come
from the compact region around the protostar with a radius of 100 au. The contour levels
for the Keplerian disk model are at intervals of 5% starting from 5% of the peak intensity.
