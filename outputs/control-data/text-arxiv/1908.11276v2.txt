Abstract: We generalize Nakajima-Yoshioka blowup equations to arbitrary gauge group
with hypermultiplets in arbitrary representations. Using our blowup equations, we compute
the instanton partition functions for 4d N = 2 and 5d N = 1 gauge theories for arbitrary
gauge theory with a large class of matter representations, without knowing explicit construction of the instanton moduli space. Our examples include exceptional gauge theories with
fundamentals, SO(N ) gauge theories with spinors, and SU (6) gauge theories with rank-3 antisymmetric hypers. Remarkably, the instanton partition function is completely determined
by the perturbative part.

Introduction

The Seiberg-Witten prepotential provides a complete description for the low energy dynamics
of 4d N = 2 or 5d N = 1 gauge theory in its Coulomb branch [1, 2]. It is a function of the
vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the scalar in the vector multiplet that parameterizes
the Coulomb branch moduli space. Quantum correction to the prepotential is known to be
one-loop exact, while there also exist non-perturbative corrections coming from Yang-Mills
instantons.
An efficient way to compute the fully quantum corrected prepotential F is to study the
Nekrasov partition function Z on Ω-deformed C2 or C2 × S 1 . It can be written as the product
of the classical, one-loop, and instanton contributions,
Z(~a, m,
~ 1 , 2 , q) = Zclass (~a, 1 , 2 , q) Z1-loop (~a, m,
~ 1 , 2 ) Zinst (~a, m,
~ 1 , 2 , q),

(1.1)

where the instanton piece is the fugacity sum over all multi-instanton contributions:
Zinst (~a, m,
~ 1 , 2 , q) = 1 +

Once the Nekrasov partition function is known, one can extract the Seiberg-Witten prepotential via taking the 1 , 2 → 0 limit as F = lim1,2 →0 1 2 log Z [3–6].

The instanton part of the partition function in the Ω-background can be computed once
we know the appropriate instanton moduli space. For the classical gauge groups, the ADHM
construction of the moduli space [7] provides a direct way to compute the instanton partition
function. The ADHM construction can be understood as the quantum mechanics describing
the Dp-D(p + 4) system. The Higgs branch moduli space of the Dp system gives the desired
moduli space. Matter fields can be also introduced by including more branes, for instance,
by considering the world-volume theory on the D0-branes of the D0-D4-D8 system. By using
the localization on the 1d system on the D0-branes or its dimensional reduction [8, 9], the
contour integral formula of the partition function has been obtained for the case of classical
gauge groups with a particular choice of matter representations [10–14]. The precise choice of
the contour of the ADHM integral has been derived in [15–17] following the Jeffrey-Kirwan
residue formula in 2d elliptic genus [18, 19].
However, there is no ADHM type construction for the exceptional gauge groups or generic
type of matter fields even for the classical group. The string-theoretic picture implies that
they require strong-coupling dynamics or non-Lagrangian field theories to realize instanton
moduli space of exceptional theories as a vacuum moduli space. Even though there has been
a number results regarding the exceptional instantons that we review later in the beginning
of Section 3, a complete way for general instanton counting is still lacking.
To this end, we generalize the blowup formula of Nakajima-Yoshioka (NY) [5, 20–24].1
In [28], the blow-up formula was used to compute the instanton partition function for exceptional gauge group without matter by extrapolating the NY blowup equation to arbitrary
gauge group. This is tested against the superconformal index of 4d SCFT where the Higgs
branch is given by the instanton moduli space [29]. Since the Nekrasov partition function
computes the topological string partition function for certain toric Calabi-Yau spaces, a similar blowup formula for topological string theory is expected. Indeed such formulae are found
and developed in [30–34]. Especially in [33, 34], non-perturbative partition functions for 6d
SCFTs are obtained using the blowup equation. We generalize the Nakajima-Yoshioka (NY)
blowup equations [5, 20–24] to arbitrary gauge group (with a possible 5d Chern-Simons term
or discrete theta angle) with hypermultiplets in arbitrary representations. We propose a
blow-up formula for a general gauge theory with arbitrary matter representations, under the
condition that the matter representation is not ‘too large’ as we discuss shortly. This enables
us to compute the instanton partition functions for numerous gauge theories that have not
been known before, without relying on the explicit construction of the moduli space.
The basic idea is as follows: Let us consider a one-point blow-up Ĉ2 of the flat space C2 .
The full partition function on Ĉ2 can be written in terms of the products of the full partition
function of C2 . But at the same time, the partition function on the blowup is identical to that
of the flat space since we can smoothly blow-down Ĉ2 to C2 . On Ĉ2 , we can insert certain
topological operator associated with the 2-cycle that turns out to be trivial via selection rule
1

This is an equivariant generalization of the blow-up formula of Donaldson invariants [25], which is also
derived and generalized in the context of Seiberg-Witten theory in [26, 27].

as long as the matter representation is not ‘too large’. This provides us functional relations
for the partition function, that we call the blowup equations of the form

(1.3)
Z=
~k∈∆

for some value of dmax that depends on the gauge group and matter content. Here, Z (N/S),d (~k)
is given entirely in terms of the flat space partition function Z and the sum is over the coroot vectors of the gauge group. It turns out that this equation is sufficient to determine the
instanton partition function itself as long as dmax ≥ 2. Remarkably, this blowup equation leads
to a set of recursion relations which can completely determine the instanton contribution from
the perturbative part of the partition function. Therefore we arrive at a surprising conclusion:
The perturbative physics determines the non-perturbative physics!
Sometimes in the resurgence analysis, the perturbative partition function constrains or even
determine the non-perturbative part. This is not necessarily the case, especially for the case
of 4d N = 2 and 5d N = 1 gauge theory that we consider [35]. In our case, we demand the
consistency of the partition function as we change the spacetime smoothly, without assuming
any analytic property, which turns out to be sufficient to determine the full partition function
from the perturbative part. In fact, it was noticed several decades ago in [36, 37] that the
instanton part of the prepotential can be determined recursively via perturbative part. What
we find here is that the same statement holds at the level of partition function in Omega
background as well.
Using the blowup equation we find, we obtain the following universal expression of the
1-instanton partition function for arbitrary gauge group and matter (5d version):

Various symbols in this expression will be explained later in section 2. But we highlight here
that this formula depends only on group-theoretic data such as the set of long roots ∆` and
weight vectors for representation Rl of each hypermultiplet labeled by l. We emphasize that
even though this expression looks completely universal, this formula turns out to be valid only
if the matter representations satisfy certain constraint. For example, it fails for the matters
in the adjoint representation. We find our 1-instanton formula in 5d is valid if

complication arises because of possible Chern-Simons term and discrete theta angle. One can
consider 4d version of the partition function as well. In this case, an analogous formula turns
P
out to be valid for any gauge group and matters with h∨ − 21 l I2 (Rl ) > 1 since we do not
have a Chern-Simons coupling nor discrete theta angle in this case. We compute instanton
partition functions for a large number of examples and test against known results, from which
we build our confidence for the generalized blowup equation we find.
The organization of this paper is as follows: In Section 2, we give a physical derivation
of the blowup equations. From this, we obtain a recursion formula to compute instanton
partition function at any number of instantons. Especially, we derive a concise closed-form
formula for one instanton partition function that works for a large number of theories. We
give a precise condition for our formula to work. In the case of 4d Nekrasov partition function,
we are able to derive the bound on the matter representation for which the formula to work.
We suggest an analogous bound for 5d version, by extrapolating known results. In Section 3,
we test our formula against various known cases. Moreover, we also obtain many previously
unknown partition functions. Some of them are expressed as the character expansion, whose
form is explicitly given in Appendix A. We then conclude with several future directions.

Instanton Counting from Blow-up

The essential idea of using the blow-up of C2 for instanton counting is that the gauge theory
partition function for a 4d N = 2 (or 5d N = 1) theory on the blow-up of a point Ĉ2 (or
Ĉ2 × S 1 ) can be written in two different ways. This will allow us to write a recursion relation
for the instanton partition function that can be solved rather easily [5, 20, 21, 28].
2.1

Blowup equation

Localization on the blow-up Ĉ2 One of the expressions for the partition function Ẑ on
the blow-up Ĉ2 comes from the Coulomb branch localization, which results that Ẑ can be
obtained by patching together the flat-space partition function Z [38].
The blow-up Ĉ2 of the complex plane is constructed from C2 by replacing the origin with
a compact 2-cycle P1 . In particular, the geometry is identical to the total space of the line
bundle of degree (−1) over P1 . One can parametrize O(−1) → P1 using the homogeneous
coordinates (z0 , z1 , z2 ), satisfying the projective condition (z0 , z1 , z2 ) ∼ (λ−1 z0 , λ1 z1 , λ1 z2 ) for
any λ ∈ C∗ , where the two-cycle P1 ⊂ Ĉ2 corresponds to the locus z0 = 0. We are interested
in the U (1)2 equivariant partition function, with the U (1)2 action V rotating the complex
coordinates (z0 , z1 , z2 ) as follows:
(z0 , z1 , z2 ) 7→ (z0 , e1 z1 , e2 z2 ).

(2.1)

Instantons are located at two fixed points of the U (1)2 action, i.e., the north/south poles of
the P1 , whose coordinates are (z0 , z1 , z2 ) = (0, 1, 0) and (0, 0, 1). Around these fixed points,
(C∗ -invariant) local coordinates are given by (z0 z1 , z2 /z1 ) and (z0 z2 , z1 /z2 ) respectively. The

–4–

local weights under the U (1)2 action V near the fixed points are:
(z0 z1 , z2 /z1 ) 7→ (e1 z0 z1 , e2 −1 z2 /z1 )

(near the north pole)

(z0 z2 , z1 /z2 ) 7→ (e2 z0 z2 , e1 −2 z1 /z2 )

(near the south pole)

(2.2)

The full partition function Ẑ on Ĉ2 , which includes both the perturbative and instanton
contributions, can be obtained by performing the localization on the Coulomb branch. On
the Coulomb branch, the gauge group is generically broken to U (1)r where r is the rank
of the gauge group. The U (1)r equivariant parameters ~a naturally appear in the partition
function. One needs to sum over all distinct field configurations with zero-sized instantons
located at the north and south poles. All the inequivalent configurations are labeled by the rdimensional vector ~k of the first Chern numbers, corresponding to different flux configurations
on the two-cycle P1 . When the gauge group has U (1) factor, we can turn on the external flux
that can be supported on the P1 . We assume there is no such a factor in the gauge group.
Summing up, Ẑ can be expressed in terms of the partition function Z on C2 as [22, 38–41]
X
Ẑ(~a, 1 , 2 , q, m)
~ =
Z (N ) (~k)Z (S) (~k) ,
(2.3)
~k∈Λ

where the flux sum is taken over the co-root lattice Λ of the gauge algebra. Each factor
represents the partition function localized at the U (1)2 fixed points (north/south-poles of the
P1 ⊂ Ĉ2 ) given as

Z (N ) (~k) ≡ Z(~a + ~k1 , 1 , 2 − 1 , q, m

2
1
(S) ~
Z (k) ≡ Z(~a + ~k2 , 1 − 2 , 2 , q, m
~ − 2 ) .
2

(2.4)

In addition to the Coulomb branch parameters, the partition function depends on the Omega
deformation parameters 1 , 2 and also mass parameters m.
~ The instanton fugacity q takes
the following form: For a 4d theory, it is given as q = e2πiτ = Λb0 where τ is the complexified
gauge coupling and Λ being the dynamical scale of the gauge theory. The exponent b0 is the
1-loop beta function coefficient. For a 5d theory, it is also given by the exponentiated gauge
−

1

coupling as q = e g2 ≡ e−m0 . Notice that the Coulomb parameter ~a gets an appropriate shift
at each fixed point p, induced by the non-trivial magnetic flux ~k on the blown-up P1 , with
the proportionality constant H|p . The values of the moment map H for the U (1)2 action V ,
i.e., dH = ιV ω, at the north and south poles are given as
H|NP = 1 and H|SP = 2 .

(2.5)

The mass parameters also get shifted since the hypermultiplet mass is twisted by SU (2)R ,
2
which makes the combination m − 1 +
invariant at the fixed points.2
2
2

One can instead use the shifted mass to simplify the formula involving mass. We use unshifted mass to
match with the existing formulae in the literature.

Partition function on Ĉ2 vs C2 Another important fact for the partition function Ẑ on
the blow-up Ĉ2 is that Ẑ is actually identical to the flat-space partition function Z [5, 20–24].
The blow-up Ĉ2 is identical to C2 except for the origin, which is replaced by the blownup sphere P1 . Since the Nekrasov partition function gets contributions only from the small
instantons localized at the fixed points of the U (1)2 equivariant action V , the size of the
divisor should not affect the partition function as we smoothly shrink it. So we expect that
Ẑ = Z. This implies the following relation:
X
Z = Ẑ =
Z (N ) (~k)Z (S) (~k).
(2.6)
~k∈Λ

This blow-up identity can be thought of as a special case of more generalized orbifold
partition functions [41–45]. For example, the Nekrasov partition function on the orbifold
C2 /Z2 can be computed in two different ways, one is via formula analogous to (2.3) by
combining the contributions from two fixed points of the blown-up geometry O(−2) → P1 .
The other way is to compute the partition function at the orbifold point using the ADHM
construction for the orbifolds. The Nekrasov partition function still remains the same as we
blow up or down the singular point.3 The only difference in our case is that we blow-up or
down a non-singular point instead of a singular point.
Correlation functions in 4d The equation (2.6) itself is not enough to fix the partition
function completely, since there are 3 unknown functions and only one relation. It turns
out the necessary additional relations can be found from the insertion of non-trivial Q-closed
operators [5, 21] associated to the two-cycle on the blow-up.
In the 4d Donaldson-twisted theory, the Q-invariant observable O2 associated to a twocycle can be constructed by applying the topological descent procedure twice to the Casimir
invariant O0 = Tr(Φ2 ) as [46]
0 = {Q, O0 }, dO0 = {Q, O1 }, dO1 = {Q, O2 },
dO2 = {Q, O3 }, dO3 = {Q, O4 }, dO4 = 0 .

(2.7)

In our case, we consider a U (1)2 -equivariant version of the topological descent procedure,
that is to choose Q so that Q2 = LV and also change d → D ≡ d + ιV to obtain the operator
associated to the two-cycle. In terms of the component fields, it can be written as [47]

function het OP1 i of the correlators hOP1 . . . OP1 i. This causes a shift of the instanton parameter
by q → q exp(tH) at the fixed points of the blow-up Ĉ2 [5, 20, 21]. The expectation value of
the generating function can be written as

Z (N ),t (~k) · Z (S),t (~k) ,

Z (S),t (~k) ≡ Z(~a + ~k2 , 1 − 2 , 2 , q exp(t2 ), m
~ − 21 2 ) .

(2.10)

Now, as we shrink the two-cycle P1 to recover the flat C2 , the effect of inserting (OP1 )d
turns out to give a vanishing contribution for small d due to the selection rule. We recall
that the instanton breaks the U (1)R symmetry to the discrete subgroup Z2b0 with b0 =
P
2h∨ − l I2 (Rl ) where the sum is over all hypermultiplets, and h∨ is the dual Coxeter number
of the gauge group and Rl denotes the representation of the l-th hypermultiplet and I2 (R)
being the quadratic Dynkin index.4 The first term of the operator OP1 (the two-form piece)
carries R-charge +2, which is the familiar non-equivariant version. This discrete R-charge is
sometimes called as a ghost number. The correlation functions vanish unless the R-charges
P
add up to zero, modulo 2b0 = 4h∨ − 2 l I2 (Rl ). Therefore, expanding (2.9) in powers of t,
we find

 ∨ P
hetOP1 i = Z + O t2h − l I2 (Rl ) .
(2.11)
This is our blowup equation. To show this, notice that each term at order tm carries pieces
with R-charge between 0 and 2m. When m < b0 , the only possible non-trivial contribution
R
comes from the R = 0 piece HF ∧ F at zero instanton sector. This piece vanishes for
zero instanton sector (at the north/south poles). For n-instanton sector, one should have
R = 2b0 n, which is the condition to absorb the fermionic zero modes. For m ≥ b0 , we always
have a term that absorbs all the fermionic zero modes (or the term that has R ≡ 0 mod 2b0 n)
so they do not vanish.
We see that as long as the hypermultiplet representation is not too large, i.e., when
P
b0 = 2h∨ − l I2 (Rl ) > 2, this allows us to write 3 independent relations for the 3 unknown
variables. One can expand het OP1 i to order t2 , O(t2 ) and then recursively solve for Z at
each instanton number. So the instanton part of the partition function will be completely
determined from the perturbative partition function. An explicit form of the recursion relation
will be studied in Section 2.2.
Correlation functions in 5d We now turn to 5d N = 1 gauge theory wrapped on S 1 .
The Casimir invariant Tr(Φ2 ) and its descendants are no longer considered as well-defined
observables. Instead, there are two types of Q-invariant observables [48]. The first type

procedure. The second type of observables introduce the 3d (Kähler) Chern-Simons term,

d appearing in the exponential in (2.14) has to be an integer to be gauge-invariant.
The reason that the instanton parameter is further shifted by exp( 2b H|p ) is that the
instanton mass parameter is twisted by SU (2)R as in the case of the hypermultiplet mass. The
SU (2)R twisted mass of the instanton soliton is given by minst ≡ m0,eff − κeff + . The effective
Chern-Simons coupling κeff also induces an electric charge to the instanton, contributing to

algebraic relations to determine the instanton partition function recursively in increasing
order of instantons. This fact was utilized in [28] to compute instanton partition function
for the gauge theories with exceptional gauge groups, for which the ADHM construction of
instanton moduli space is unknown.
In this paper, we aim at developing the relation (2.17) for various 5d N = 1 gauge
theories with hypermultiplets in various representations, so as to compute the instanton
partition function. We will identify a certain bound on d in Section 2.3 as the necessary
condition for (2.17) for a large number of theories. We conjecture that the bound on d we
obtain is actually sufficient to obtain the blowup equation (2.17). While we do not attempt to
prove this sufficiency, we compute n-instanton partition function Zn , based on the recursion
formula that will be derived shortly from (2.17), and confirm the agreement with the known
result obtained from an alternative method.
We find a universal expression for the bound on d when the gauge group is neither SU (N )
nor Sp(N ):

This is essentially identical condition as in 4d N = 2 gauge theory. But in 5d, some new
effects come into play. For the SU (N ) case, we can have a Chern-Simons term generated at
1-loop, which alters the bound on d. When there is neither bare nor effective Chern-Simons
coupling, the same bound holds for the SU (N ) case as well. The detailed condition will be
given in section 2.3. For the case of Sp(N ), one can turn on the discrete θ-parameter and it
turns out the bound on d depends on this parameter.
2.2

Recursion formula for 5d instanton partition function

The blowup equation (2.17) can be translated to a recursion formula on the (5d) n-instanton
contribution Zn to the full partition function Z. To derive this, we decompose the partition
function Z in terms of the classical, one-loop, and instanton pieces:
Z(~a, 1 , 2 , q, m)
~ = Zclass (~a, 1 , 2 , q, m)
~ · Z1-loop (~a, 1 , 2 , m)
~ · Zinst (~a, 1 , 2 , q, m),
~
where Zinst can be further expanded in terms of the instanton fugacity q as7

Sometimes the instanton partition function is expanded in powers of the shifted instanton mass

q exp(−b 1 +
) instead of q [21, 22, 28]. We expand it with the true instanton fugacity, which makes the

symmetry property 1,2 → −1,2 of Zn manifest. This is the one that we obtain using the ADHM quantum

There exists an ambiguity in writing the perturbative partition function, which depends on a choice of
the C2 boundary condition at infinity. The equations (2.23) and (2.24) are fixed upon a specific choice. The
‘Casimir part’ of Z1-loop is included here to make fd (~k)1-loop and thus the whole blow-up equations respect the
charge conjugation, regardless of the ambiguity. We thank Hee-Cheol Kim for the related comment.

Notice that we have a set of equations labeled by the parameter d. If the blowup equation
holds for at least 3 values of d, we can solve it for Zn . The n-instanton partition function
Zn is given as the solution to the three linear equations (2.34) with consecutive integers

Since In only involves low-order instanton corrections, the n-instanton partition function Zn
can be constructed from Zm<n , allowing us to obtain the full non-perturbative part Zinst in
a recursive manner starting from Z0 = 1.
Therefore we arrive at a remarkable conclusion. The non-perturbative partition function
Zinst is completely fixed by the perturbative partition function! We note that we do not reach
this conclusion by requiring the perturbative series to be well-behaved, as is often done in
the resurgence analysis. Instead, we demand consistency upon smooth deformation of the
spacetime C2 or C2 × S 1 . Such consistency condition requires non-perturbative parts to
exist and even enough to fix the instanton partition function (at least for a large number of
examples).
Now, let us write the solution for 1-instanton explicitly. At one instanton level, the
formula (2.35) can be written as

that accounts for the shift of instanton fugacity.
We claim that (2.39) is the closed-form expression for the one-instanton partition function,
which holds universally for any gauge theory with dmax > 2. In section 2.3, we study the
structure of the blowup equations to bound the number of possible independent equations.
2.3

Number of independent blowup equations

We are mainly interested in 4d N = 2 and 5d N = 1 gauge theories which are UV-complete.
The UV-complete set of 4d N = 2 gauge theories are classified in [53]. For 5d gauge theories
that are UV complete as 5d SCFTs, possible matter representations are restricted to [54]:11

A numerical value of d0 should be a half-integer for theories with G = Sp(N )θ=π .
A gauge group is always assumed to be simple in the current paper.

• fundamental representation for SU (N ), SO(N ), Sp(N ), G2 , F4 , E6 , E7
• antisymmetric representation for SU (N ), Sp(N )
• spinor representation for SO(N ) with 7 ≤ N ≤ 14
• rank-3 antisymmetric representation for Sp(3), Sp(4), SU (6), SU (7)
• symmetric representation for SU (N ).
In the case of 4d, we can also have the following additional cases:
• adjoint representation for arbitrary group
• rank-3 antisymmetric for SU (8)
• 16 for Sp(2) (half-hypermultiplet)
We note that though our blow-up formula is applicable to a large number of 5d theories with
various matter representations, we are not able to apply our formula for some cases including
the one with adjoint hypermultiplet since the number of independent blowup equations is
smaller than 3.
The formula (2.33) is valid only for a certain range of d, for which h(OP1 )d i = Z. We
want to narrow down the valid range of d by performing a simple sanity check on the blowup
equation for the one-instanton partition function:

Specifically, we want to examine the expansion of each term in (2.42) in powers of p1 p2  1.
The leading exponent of each term behaves as

where g0,1,2 (~a, m
~ tw ) are functions independent of p1,2 and Nsym denotes the number of symmetric representation. The numerical value of s will be obtained shortly for a variety of gauge
theories for which ADHM-like construction is available. Notice that for the equation (2.42)
to be true, some terms on the right-hand side should have the leading exponent less than or
equal to that of Z1 . Therefore, the condition d − 2b ≥ − 2s is naturally imposed, setting a lower
bound on d.

– 14 –

Similarly, an upper bound on d can be found from an expansion of (2.42) with respect
to 1/p1 p2  1.12 Each term in (2.42) can be written as

b
h0 (~a, m

Again, for (2.42) to be consistent, the leading exponent of Z1 should be greater than or equal
to those of the terms on the right-hand side. Such a requirement imposes an upper bound on
0
d, namely s2 ≥ d − 2b . Combining the two inequalities, one can identify the following range

as a necessary condition for (2.42). We explicitly checked that the n-instanton partition

function Zn actually satisfies all the ( s+s

for numerous examples whose Zn is already known from alternative methods. This is true
even though the bound (2.45) itself is merely a necessary condition found from one-instanton
analysis. Based on this empirical observation, we claim that the 5d recursion formulae (2.33)
within the above range of d is true at all instanton orders.
Another remarkable thing is that a numerical value of (s, s0 ) exhibits the very simple
pattern across a broad range of theories whose gauge group is not SU (N )κ .

This is equivalent to assuming a different parameter regime 0 < ai < −+ < m for all 1 ≤ i ≤ r. In
general, an explicit form of the 1-loop partition function (2.23)–(2.24) can change depending on a parameter
regime, thus affecting (2.33). However, all the above expressions remain valid under flipping a sign of + , such
that we can simply study the expansion of the single terms in (2.42) with respect to 1/p1 p2  1.

as a basic assumption to obtain the partition function Z for any G 6= SU (N )κ gauge theory.
It would be desirable to understand from the first principle the range (2.47) of d for which
(2.33) holds true.
It turns out to be more difficult to characterize a general pattern behind (s, s0 ) for SU (N )κ
gauge theories, due to extra complication caused by the 5d Chern-Simons level κ. Here we
consider two particular classes of SU (N )κ gauge theories for illustration. For SU (N )κ + Nf F
gauge theory (Nf fundamental hypermultiplets) with Nf + 2|κ| ≤ 2N , we find that

from which one can identify the valid range of d via (2.45). As long as there exist at least
three distinct allowed values for d for given (N, κ), the corresponding partition function Zinst
can be solved from the recursion formula (2.33).
We also consider SU (6)κ + 1TAS theory (one rank-3 antisymmetric tensor) with |κ| ≤ 3
in Section 3. This model can be Higgsed to two disjoint copies of SU (3)κ theory without a
bifundamental hypermultiplet [55]. At the level of the partition function, Higgsing is realized
by turning off mtw = 0 and imposing the SU (3) traceless conditions. As neither of them
modifies s nor s0 , the numerical value of (s, s0 ) must be identical to that of SU (3)κ gauge
theory, the blowup equation always holds for the range 0 ≤ d ≤ 3. Therefore, the recursion
formula (2.33) is enough to determine the instanton partition function Zinst for SU (6)κ +1TAS
theory as well.
We give the list of theories we consider in the current paper in Table 1.

0
to 4d N = 2) gauge theory whose (s, s0 ) satisfies s+s
2 ≥ 2. Combined with the observation
that (s, s0 ) follows (2.46) in most cases, they become a very efficient approach to obtaining
the BPS partition function on C2 × S 1 (or C2 ), unless the matter representation is ‘too large.’
Conventionally, the instanton partition function can be computed by employing the
ADHM construction of the instanton moduli space [3, 4, 7] or by applying the topological vertex formalism to the 5-brane web [56, 57]. Both are based on a certain UV realization
of 5d N = 1 gauge theory via geometric engineering in string theory. Even though IR 5d
gauge theory sometimes can be obtained using more than one string theory realizations, the
correct UV completion might be only achieved through specific string theory realizations.

Table 1: List of 5d gauge theories whose partition function is determined via the blowup
equations. The number of hypermultiplets are bounded so that there are at least 3 blowup
equations. For the case of SU (N ) + Nf F theory, it turns out that the Young diagram formula
(3.1) always satisfy at least 3 blowup equations. When Nf + 2|κ| > 2N , however, this formula
does not produce the correct partition function for the UV field theory as we discuss in the
text.
For instance, the SU (2) gauge theory with Nf fundamental hypermultiplets with Nf ≥ 5
must be embedded into D4-D8-O8 brane system to be UV-completed as 5d ENf +1 MinahanNemeschansky SCFT [58–60]. Ordinary (p, q) 5-brane web with colliding branes (without
O-planes) indicate UV inconsistency [61]. A sensible QFT observable can thus be obtained
only through a proper embedding of the gauge theory into string theory. In some occasions,
an extra factor dressing the true QFT observable may appear during the above instanton computation, which is sensitive to the choice of a string theory embedding. Our blow-up formula
(2.33) does not explicitly specify a particular UV completion nor string theory embedding.
However, we observe that the formula does prefer a particular string theory embedding of the
gauge theory. For example, for the SU (2) gauge theory with Nf fundamental hypermultiplets,
we find the partition function obtained from the blow-up formula agrees with the partition
function obtained from the ordinary (p, q) 5-brane webs.
There are wide varieties of ‘exceptional’ gauge theories (having exceptional gauge groups
or exotic matter representations) whose UV completion is found as M-theory wrapped on a
singular Calabi-Yau 3-fold [62–65]. As most exceptional theories lack the ADHM description
[66], their instanton partition function Zinst has been studied in a case-by-case basis. Once
the 5-brane web configuration engineering an exceptional theory is identified [55, 67, 68], the
topological vertex formalism can be applied to compute the relevant partition function Z
[57, 69]. Alternatively, one can first construct the C2 × T 2 partition function for a related
6d gauge theory, based on its modularity and anomaly, then take the circle reduction to
obtain the 5d partition function Z [70, 71]. Several interesting exceptional theories have been

– 18 –

studied so far, based on the above two approaches. Sometimes, there exists auxiliary 4d N = 2
SCFT [72] that realizes exceptional instanton moduli space as its Higgs branch.13 In this case,
computing the superconformal index in the Higgs branch limit provides a way to compute the
necessary instanton partition function for the exceptional gauge theory [29, 74–77]. Likewise,
3d N = 4 theory can realize exceptional instanton moduli space via its Coulomb branch [78].
Computing its Hilbert series (or the Coulomb branch limit of the superconformal index), one
can compute the instanton partition function [79, 80]. We will illustrate that bootstrapping
the instanton partition function Zinst based on the recursion formula (2.33) works well for
those ‘exceptional’ theories, providing their BPS spectrum efficiently.
3.1

Theories with known ADHM description

Let us first consider the ‘standard’ gauge theories with classical gauge groups, whose hypermultiplet admits UV realization as a perturbative string ending on D-branes. In these cases,
the ADHM construction of the instanton moduli space is well-known [3, 7, 51]. As for the kinstanton partition function Zk , the Witten index of the relevant ADHM quantum mechanics
can be computed by SUSY localization [15, 81–83], ending up collecting all Jeffrey-Kirwan
residues of a multi-dimensional contour integral. We will examine whether the recursion
formula (2.33) actually produces the same result as the localization computation.
SU(N) The ADHM construction for the n-instanton partition function, for SU (N )κ + Nf F
(Nf fundamentals) theory with Nf + 2|κ| ≤ 2N is well-known. Its partition function can be
written as a sum over Young diagrams as

for

σ = (m, n) ∈ Yi .

Here hi (σ) denotes the distance from σ to the right end of the diagram Yi by moving right
and vj (σ) denotes the distance from σ to the bottom of the diagram Yj by moving down. We
checked that the instanton partition functions Z1 and Z2 obtained from the recursion formula
ADHM
(2.33) with (2.50) and the 1-instanton expression (2.39) precisely agree with the above Zn=1,2
for N = 2, 3, 4.
As we have said earlier, ZnADHM often contains an additional factor Zextra that captures
the contribution from an extra branch of vacua of the ADHM quantum mechanics. It is
sensitive to the string theory embedding (UV completion) of the gauge theory and can be

n=0

A non-trivial Zextra 6= 1 appears in the above expression (3.1) if and only if Nf + 2|κ| = 2N .
This factor can be identified as the contribution of D1-branes escaping from D5-branes which
engineer the SU (N )κ +Nf F gauge theory. Since Zn = ZnADHM , the same factor Zextra emerges
from the recursion formula (2.33) as well. The 5-brane web construction of the gauge theory
is thus indirectly reflected in the recursion formula.
A similar observation is that the 1-instanton expression (2.39) applied to SU (2)κ + Nf F
with Nf ≥ 5 does not match the Witten index of the D0-D4-D8-O8− quantum mechanics,
which is the correct 1-instanton partition function.14 Instead, it coincides with the topological vertex computation applied to the 5-brane web with a colliding pair of branes, which
engineers the SU (2) gauge theory with Nf ≥ 5 in the IR, but behaves badly in the UV.
Again, this suggests that the recursion formula (2.33) implicitly chooses a specific string theory construction of the gauge theory, i.e., the web of (p, q) 5-branes. It would be interesting
to figure out if there is a version of the recursion relation (2.33) that allows us to choose the
particular UV embedding of the gauge theory.
For the SU (N )κ + Nf F + 1AS theory (Nf fundamental and 1 anti-symmetric hypermultiplets) with Nf + 2|κ| ≤ N + 4, the ADHM quantum mechanics is the worldvolume theory of
D1-branes, probing the D5-NS5-D7-O7− brane configuration that realizes the gauge theory.
Let us compute the Witten index for 1 and 2 D1-branes, then compare with the blow-up
computation based on the recursion formula (2.33). For instance, the Witten index for the
single D1-brane can be written as

Note that ZnADHM contains an extra factor Zextra 6= 1 if Nf + 2|κ| = N + 4, coming from the
spectrum of D1-branes escaping from the D5-branes on which the gauge theory is supported.
The appearance of Zextra 6= 1 is an artifact of the string theory embedding, spurious from the
5d QFT perspective. We checked that Z1ADHM and the 1-instanton formula (2.39) agree for the

SU (3), SU (4), SU (5) theories whose (n, n0 ) satisfies n+n

as well, where Z2 is the solution of the recursion formulae (2.33) with (2.51). The same

Sp(N) The n-instanton partition function for Sp(N )θ + Nf F theory (θ being the discrete
theta-angle for Sp and Nf fundamental hypermultiplets) with Nf ≤ 2N + 4 can be computed
from the ADHM quantum mechanics of D1-D5-NS5-O5 branes, which engineers the gauge

(2.47). Note that there is no spurious factor Zextra so that the ADHM and the blowup results
agree ZnADHM = Zn for these theories.
For the Sp(N )θ + Nf F + 1AS theory (Nf fundamental and 1 anti-symmetric hypermultiplets) with Nf ≤ 7, the relevant ADHM quantum mechanics is the worldvolume gauge theory
of D0-branes which probe the D4-D8-O8 brane configuration. It is well-known that the QFT
on D4-branes exhibits an enhanced ENf +1 flavor symmetry at the UV fixed point [58]. Let
us consider the Witten index for one and two D0-branes [15, 84]. For a single D0-brane, we

We find that Z1ADHM itself is not the same as the 1-instanton expression from the blowup
(2.39) for the Sp(2)θ , Sp(3)θ theories with Nf ≤ 1 (at θ = 0) and Nf ≤ 2 (at θ = π). Instead,
the difference between Z1 and Z1ADHM can be identified as the BPS index of D0-branes
moving away from the D4-D8-O8 brane system [15, 84]. Similarly, we confirmed that the 2instanton correction Z2 captures the same 5d QFT spectrum as in Z2ADHM , upon subtracting
the spurious contribution of escaping D0-branes. It is interesting that our blow-up formula
does not contain a spurious factor Zextra .
SO(N) One can compute the instanton partition function of SO(N ) + Nv V theory (Nv
hypermultiplets in the vector representation) with Nv ≤ N − 4 using the ADHM quantum
mechanics of the D1-D5-NS5-O5 brane system. For even N , the Witten index for a single

An exceptional case is the SU (2) gauge theory, in which the antisymmetric hypermultiplet decouples and

The general 1-instanton expression (2.39) and the recursion formula (2.33) are applicable for
all Nv ≤ N − 4. We explicitly verified that ZnADHM = Zn for n = 1, 2 and 4 ≤ N ≤ 9, where
Z1 is written in (2.39) and Z2 is the solution of the recursion formula (2.33). We find that
ZnADHM = Zn involves a non-trivial extra factor Zextra 6= 1 when Nv = N − 4. This extra
factor can be attributed to the D1-branes moving away from the D5-NS5-O5 brane system,
where the 5d QFT lives. It implies that a specific UV realization of the gauge theory, i.e.,
type IIB string theory with D1-D5-NS5-O5, is implicit in our recursion formulae (2.33) with
(2.47).
3.2

Theories with spinor hypermultiplets

So far, we have investigated the ‘standard’ gauge theories that have certain D-brane set-ups
in type IIA/IIB string theory to realize themselves and also their instantons. For the theory
with a sufficient number of the blowup equations, the n-instanton partition function Zn can
be determined as the solution of the blowup equations. We have found that this formula
agrees with the instanton counting result using the ADHM construction, modulo possible
extra factor Zextra that is sensitive to the string theory embedding of the gauge theory.
We take advantage of the universality of the blowup equation. Recall that the blow-up
recursion formula (2.33) holds for a certain range of d, i.e., the set of all integers between
P
0 ≤ d ≤ h∨ − 21 l I(Rl ), when the gauge group G is neither SU (N )κ nor Sp(N )θ . In this
case, there is no extra complication due to the Chern-Simons level κ or the theta angle θ. One
can solve the recursion formulae for the n-instanton correction Zn to the partition function,
P
as long as h∨ − 12 l I(Rl ) ≥ 2, even for the exceptional gauge theories. We conjecture that
Zn solved from the recursion formula would be the correct BPS data for UV-consistent 5d
SCFTs, modulo an extra factor Zextra independent of the Coulomb VEV ~a. This conjecture
will be tested via comparison with [55, 66, 71] which compute Z for some exceptional cases.
In this section, we will focus on the SO(N ) gauge theories with spinor hypermultiplets.
We have a sufficient number of recursion formulae (2.33) to determine the n-instanton partition function Zn of the SO(N ) gauge theory, if and only if

where Nv , Ns , and Nc denote the number of hypermultiplets in the vector, spinor and conjugate spinor representations, respectively. Our 1-instanton expression (2.39) is also applicable
to the cases satisfying (3.8). We compare our formula against any known results for SO(N )
gauge theory with a number of spinor hypermultiplets [66, 71]. We not only find perfect
agreements for the case with the known results, but also obtain partition functions for the
previously unknown cases as well.
SO(7) The n-instanton contribution Zn of SO(7) + Ns S theory can be obtained from the

We verified that Z1YD and the 1-instanton formula Z1 in (2.39) agree for Ns ≤ 3. We further
confirmed at two instanton order for Ns ≤ 3 that Z2YD = Z2 , where Z2 is the solution of
the recursion formula (2.33) with (2.47). Such explicit comparison implies that the blow-up
recursion formula (2.33) indeed works for the SO(7) + Ns S theory.
The 1-instanton partition function of SO(7) + 4S + 1V theory is given in (H.15) of
[71]. From this expression, we can obtain the 1-instanton correction of SO(7) + Ns S + Nv V
theory with (Ns , Nv ) ≤ (2, 1) by integrating out hypermultiplets or equivalently taking some
flavor chemical potentials to infinity. We confirmed that the result agrees with our general
1-instanton expression (2.39) up to order (p1 p2 )13/2 . Notice that our formula holds for any
Nv + Ns ≤ 2 and can be used to compute arbitrary high orders in instanton number.
SO(8) Our instanton formula should hold for Nv + Ns + Nc ≤ 4. Let us compare it with
known results.
The 1-instanton result of SO(8) + 1S + 1C + 1V theory is found in (H.28) of [71].
It is expressed in terms of characters of irreducible representations χSR , whose superscript
S ∈ {G, v, s, c} means either the gauge symmetry (G) or the flavor symmetry acting on
the vector (v), spinor (s), or conjugate spinor (c) hypermultiplets. Their representation R
is specified by the Dynkin label in the subscript. All irreducible characters for the flavor
symmetry are assumed to be written in the orthogonal basis, to be compatible with our
convention of mass parameters in (2.24), (2.33), (2.39). The mass parameters will be often
distinguished by the superscript S ∈ {s, c, v} according to the matter representation. The
flavor symmetry is Sp(Nv )v × Sp(Ns )s × Sp(Nc )c .
We can obtain the 1-instanton partition function of SO(8) + Ns S + Nc C + Nv V theory
with (Ns , Nc , Nv ) ≤ (1, 1, 1) from (H.28) of [71] by sending appropriate mass parameters
to infinity. All the results obtained in this way is consistent with our general 1-instanton

It can be done by shuffling the Coulomb VEVs and renaming the flavor chemical potentials.
We rearranged Z1 in terms of the new variables ~a0 or ~a00 ,
(a01 , a02 , a03 , a04 ) = ( −a1 +a22+a3 −a4 , −a1 +a22+a3 −a4 , −a1 +a22+a3 −a4 , −a1 +a22+a3 −a4 )
(a001 , a002 , a003 , a004 ) = ( +a1 −a22−a3 −a4 , −a1 +a22−a3 −a4 , −a1 −a22+a3 −a4 , +a1 +a22+a3 −a4 ),

which exchanges the SO(8) irreducible characters as

χ(ns na nv nc ) (~a) = χ(nv na nc ns ) (~a00 )|~a00 →~a .

which is consistent with the triality.
Similarly, we also found the 1-instanton formula (2.39) applied to SO(8) theories with
(Ns , Nc , Nv ) ≤ (4, 0, 0) or (0, 4, 0) is compatible with the SO(8) triality. Starting with the
1-instanton result Z1ADHM = Z1ADHM (~a, 1 , 2 , m)

mechanics for SO(8) + Nv V theory with Nv ≤ 4, we find

(3.15)

SO(9) For the SO(9) theory with Ns spinor and Nv vector, our blowup formula is valid for
Nv + 2Ns ≤ 5. The 1-instanton formula (2.39) can be applied to (Ns , Nv ) ≤ (1, 3) or (2, 1),
which has Sp(Ns )s × Sp(Nv )v flavor symmetry. It can be compared with the 1-instanton
partition function of SO(9) + 2S + 3V theory, which is written in (H.20) of [71] up to t7 order,
after appropriately taking some mass parameters to infinity. We checked all their consistency
up to the given order. For example, the character expansion of Ẑ1 for SO(9) + 2S + 1V can
be written as

which is tested against the general formula (2.39) up to t20 order. It is the same as (H.20) of
[71] after reducing the Sp(3)v characters by
χv(001) → χv(1) ,

χv(010) → 1,

χv(100) → 0,

χv(000) → 0.

(3.17)

SO(10) We apply our 1-instanton expression (2.39) to SO(10) + Ns S + Nc C + Nv V theory
with (Ns , Nc , Nv ) ≤ (2, 0, 2), (1, 1, 2), (0, 2, 2), (1, 0, 4), (0, 1, 4). The relevant flavor symmetry
is U (Ns + Nc ) × Sp(Nv ) because the SO(10) (conjugate) spinor is a complex representation.
Since the SO(10) charge conjugation exchanges the spinor and conjugate spinor representaG

tions, i.e., χG
(00001) = (χ(00010) ) , the instanton partition function for SO(10) + (Ns ∓ 1)S +
(Nc ± 1)C + Nv V must be identified with that of SO(10) + Ns S + Nc C + Nv V simply by
flipping the sign of mass parameters for (conjugate) spinor hypermultiplets:
Z1Ns ,Nc ,Nv (ms1,··· ,Ns ; mc1,··· ,Nc ) = Z1Ns −1,Nc +1,Nv (ms1,··· ,Ns −1 ; mc1,··· ,Nc +1 )
= Z1Ns +1,Nc −1,Nv (ms1,··· ,Ns +1 ; mc1,··· ,Nc −1 )

– 25 –

mcNc +1 =−msNs
msNs +1 =−mcNc

. (3.18)

This relation is explicitly confirmed in all above cases at 1-instanton order. We may want
to compare (2.39) with the known 1-instanton partition function of SO(10) + 1S + 1C + 4V
theory, written in (H.21) of [71], after taking relevant mass parameters to infinity. However,
(H.21) specifies Z̃1 only up to O(t5 ), which leaves nothing for comparison once we reduce the
mass parameters. Thus the consistency between two expressions can be only weakly tested.
For instance, Z̃1 obtained from (2.39) for SO(10) + Ns S + Nc C + 4V theory with Ns + Nc = 2
is displayed in (A.5), which turns out to be trivial upto t4 order.
SO(12) The 1-instanton partition function of SO(12) + 1S + 6V theory is written in (H.22)
of [71], up to t8 order. It can be compared with our 1-instanton formula (2.39) applied to
SO(12) + Ns S + Nc C + Nv V theory with (Ns , Nc , Nv ) ≤ (1, 0, 4) or (0, 1, 4), whose flavor
symmetry acting on matter multiplets is SO(2Ns )s × SO(2Nc )c × Sp(Nv )v . For comparison,
we need to appropriately decouple some mass parameters in (H.22) to infinity. It reduces the
Sp(6)v characters in (H.22) to, e.g., the Sp(4)v irreducible characters as follows:
χv(000000) → 0,
χv(001000) → χv(1000) ,

χv(100000) → 0,
χv(000100) → χv(0100) ,

χv(010000) → 1,
χv(000001) → χv(0001) .

(3.19)

We explicitly confirmed that (H.22) and (2.39) agree up to the given order, for (Ns , Nc , Nv ) =
(1, 0, 4). Moreover, we checked that the 1-instanton results Z1 from (2.39) for (Ns , Nc , Nv ) =
(1, 0, Nv ) and (0, 1, Nv ) could be interchanged as follows:
Z1Ns =1,Nc =0,Nv (a1 , a2 , a3 , a4 , a5 , a6 ) = Z1Ns =0,Nc =1,Nv (a1 , a2 , a3 , a4 , a5 , −a6 ).

(3.20)

Summary of new results We have compared so far the solution Z1 of the recursion
formulae (2.33) with the known 1-instanton partition function for various SO(N ) theories
with spinor hypermultiplets. The comparison showed consistency for all the examples whose
Z1 had been computed [66, 71]. We also collect the character expansion of the 1-instanton
partition function (2.39) in Appendix A for novel SO(N ) theories with spinor matters. See
Table 2 for the list of character expansions.

Theories with an exceptional gauge group

(2.39) to study the instanton partition function of exceptional gauge theories. One can find
a sufficient number of recursion formulae (2.33) to fix the n-instanton partition function Zn ,
if and only if the gauge theory has the following number of fundamental hypermultiplets:

with (Nf , Nf¯) ≤ (3, 0), (2, 1), (1, 2), (0, 3) whose flavor symmetry is U (Nf + Nf¯). Since the
fundamental and anti-fundamental representations are interchanged by the E6 charge conjugation, their instanton partition functions should be identical upon inverting the sign of
relevant mass parameters. We explicitly confirmed that (2.39) satisfies the relations

SU(6) theory with a rank-3 antisymmetric hypermultiplet

Another non-trivial test of our blow-up recursion formulae (2.33) is the partition function for
5d SU (6) theory with a hypermultiplet in the rank-3 antisymmetric representation (TAS).
This theory has can be Higgsed to a theory with SU (3) × SU (3) gauge symmetry that can
be explicitly checked at the level of the partition function.
To have a UV fixed point, 5d SU (6) theories can have up to 2 hypermultiplets in the rank3 antisymmetric representation [54]. Their type IIB 5-brane configurations were constructed
in [55] with/without O5-planes. In particular, 5-brane web diagrams for SU (6) + 21 TAS and
SU (6) + 1TAS do not contain orientifold planes, so that topological vertex method [56, 57]
can be straightforwardly applied to compute their partition functions. In [55], for instance,
the partition function of SU (6) 5 + 12 TAS theory was computed up to two instantons using
2
the topological vertex formalism.
Our blow-up equation (2.17) demands all mass parameters to be generically turned on.
In particular, we need a mass parameter for the rank-3 antisymmetric hypermultiplet. As one
cannot introduce mass for a half-hypermultiplet, let us consider the SU (6)3 theory with a full
hypermultiplet in the rank-3 antisymmetric representation (SU (6)3 +1TAS). An example for
5-brane web for SU (6)3 + 1TAS is depicted in Figure 1. It is instructive to see if Figure 1 is
consistent with the expected prepotential. The effective prepotential on the Coulomb branch
of a 5d gauge theory with a gauge group G and matter f in a representation Rf is [50]

One can easily see that the monopole string tensions Ti = ∂F/∂φi computed from the above
prepotential (3.29) agree with the areas of the compact faces of the 5-brane web, i.e.,

where the encircled numbers represent the area of apparent faces in Figure 1. This shows
that Figure 1 is indeed consistent with the prepotential of SU (6)3 + 1TAS gauge theory.
Notice that this 5-brane web for SU (6)3 + 1TAS suggests an intriguing Higgsing of the
theory, which is the Higgsing of SU (6) theory with one rank-3 antisymmetric hyper into two
disjoint SU (3) theories. It can be achieved by setting the Coulomb branch parameters as
a5 = −a1 − a6 ,

or equivalently

φ4 = φ1 .

(3.31)

This tuning of the parameters, of course, reduces dimension of the Coulomb branch by one and
also opens up a Higgs branch in such a way that the 5-brane web in Figure 1 becomes 5-brane
web in Figure 2(a) where the D5-branes on the upper edges of 6 and 7 are aligned and joint
to become a single D5-brane denoted red in Figure 2(a). The resulting configuration is then
a 5-brane configuration for two pure SU (3)3 theories that are on top of each other, as shown
in Figure 2(b). This is a 5-brane realization of Higgsing SU (6)3 + 1TAS theory into two pure
SU (3)3 theories. It follows that under this Higgsing, the prepotential for SU (6)3 + 1TAS
(3.29) theory reduces to a sum of prepotentials for two disjoint pure SU (3)3 theories:

This in turn implies that under this Higgsing, the partition function for SU (6)3 + 1TAS
should be expressed as a product of the partition functions of two pure SU (3)3 theories:

Higgsing

→ Z SU (3)3(q, A1 , A5 , A6 ) Z SU (3)3(q, A2 , A3 , A4 ) Zextra (q) ,

where the parameters q and Ai are the Kähler parameters for instanton and Coulomb branch
parameters, and Zextra (q) represents the overall extra terms that do not explicitly depend on
the Coulomb branch moduli, which would correspond to a new decoupled mode appearing in
Figure 2. In what follows, we explicitly compute the partition function for SU (6)3 + 1TAS
based on the 5-brane web and compare it with our general 1-instanton formula (2.39). At two
instantons, we will consider this Higgsing as a consistency check of our solution Z2 obtained
from the blowup recursion formulae (2.33).
To compute the instanton partition function based on the 5-brane web for SU (6)3 +1TAS
given in Figure 1, we assign the Young diagrams Yi to each horizontal edge of the web diagram
as shown in Figure 3 and use the topological vertex method. For convenience, we restrict
ourselves to the unrefined case where 2+ = 1 + 2 = 0. (See also a similar calculation done
in [55].) As the web diagram in Figure 1 is left-right symmetric, it is convenient to split
the web diagram to the left and right parts and glue them later to obtain the full partition
function. Let us introduce the following fugacity variables to express the partition function.

Conclusion

In this paper, we have found the blowup equations for the Nekrasov partition function that
hold for a large set of 4d and 5d gauge theories. We listed the theories that are determined
via the blowup equations in Table 1, and tested against various examples in Section 3. In
particular, the blowup formula enables us to compute instanton partition functions for ‘exceptional’ theories whose ADHM description is not known. One of the remarkable aspects of the
blowup formulae is that the instanton part of the partition function is completely determined
via the perturbative part of the partition function. Let us make a couple of comments on
future directions.
First, we have not given a fully general condition for the blowup formula to hold in the
case of 5d SU (N ) gauge theory. For the case of 4d N = 2 theory, the general conditions
for arbitrary gauge theory is given by the selection rule obtained from an unbroken subgroup
of U (1)R symmetry. It would be desirable to find an analogous explanation for dmax in 5d
SU (N ) theories.
Secondly, there must be a broader set of blow-up relations for the 5d Nekrasov partition
function Z, similar to those recently found for topological string partition functions and
6d minimal SCFTs [30–34]. We expect that there exists recursion formulae, derived from
the generalized blow-up equations, realize different string theory embeddings of the gauge
theory. It would be very interesting if one can reveal the connection between the choice of
UV embedding and the blow-up equations. In this way, it may be possible to determine the
partition function even for the theories that we are not able to fix in the current paper.
Finally, we remark that though our blow-up formula is applicable to a fairly large set
of theories that contain hypermultiplets of various representations, it is not clear how to
implement our blow-up formula to theories with half-hypermultiplets. There exist many
interesting gauge theories with half-hypermultiplets, such as trifundamentals in generalized
SU (2) quiver gauge theories [88] that appear in AGT correspondence [89] or bifundamentals
in SO − Sp quiver theories. To the best of our knowledge, instanton counting with halfhypermultiplet has not been studied except for [13, 14] some time ago, and there is recent
progress in [90]. Our blowup formula is naturally written in terms of the representation of
a full hypermultiplet, therefore it is not obvious how to incorporate half-hypermultiplet. It
would be interesting to develop a way to do instanton counting for half-hypermultiplets as
well.

One-instanton partition functions

This appendix collects the character expansion of the 1-instanton partition function Z1 for

a variety of 5d N = 1 gauge theories. For simplicity, we display the Z̃1 ≡ (2 sinh 1,2
2 ) · Z1
which takes off the center-of-mass factor. They are written in terms of irreducible characters
χSR , whose superscript S ∈ {G, v, s, c, f, f¯} indicates the gauge symmetry (G) or the flavor
symmetry acting on the vector (v), spinor (s), conjugate spinor (c), fundamental (f ), or antifundamental (f¯) hypermultiplets. The representation R of an irreducible character χSR is
specified by its Dynkin label.16 An irreducible character for the flavor symmetry is assumed
to be in the orthogonal basis, such that it can be consistent with the mass parameters m`
introduced in Section 2. We will often distinguish the mass parameters by the superscript
S ∈ {s, c, v, f, f¯} according to the matter representation.
SO(8) The flavor symmetry acting on Ns S + Nc C + Nv V matter multiplets is given by
Sp(Ns )s × Sp(Nc )c × Sp(Nv )v . For (Ns , Nc , Nv ) = (3, 1, 0), the character expansion of the
1-instanton result Z̃1 is

which was compared with the closed-form expression (2.39) up to t20 order. We checked that
the 1-instanton partition functions Z1 from (2.39) for (Ns , Nc , Nv ) = (3, 1, 0) and (1, 3, 0)
could be interchanged as follows:
(Ns ,Nc ,Nv )=(1,3,0)

(Ns ,Nc ,Nv )=(3,1,0)

(a1 , a2 , a3 , a4 ) = Z1

(a1 , a2 , a3 , −a4 ).

(A.2)

The SO(8) triality (3.12) was also confirmed as in Section 3.2. Namely, we found that
(Ns ,Nc ,Nv )=(3,1,0)

(A.4)

The character expansion for other SO(8) theories with less number of hypermultiplets can
be obtained from (A.1) by decoupling some mass parameters to infinity. It was checked that
the general 1-instanton formula (2.39) agrees with that.
SO(10) The flavor symmetry acting on Ns S + Nc C + Nv V hypermultiplets is U (Ns +
Nc )s × Sp(Nv )v , reflecting that the SO(10) (conjugate) spinor representation is complex. For
