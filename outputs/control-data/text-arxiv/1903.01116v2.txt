Abstract
This is the first installment in a series of papers aimed at generalizing symplectic capacities
and homologies. The main purposes of this paper are to construct analogues of Ekeland-Hofer
and Hofer-Zehnder symplectic capacities based on a class of Hamiltonian boundary value
problems motivated by Clarke’s and Ekeland’s work, and to study generalizations of some
important results about the original these two capacities (for example, the famous Weinstein
conjecture, representation formula for cEH and cHZ , a theorem by Evgeni Neduv, BrunnMinkowski type inequality and Minkowski billiard trajectories proposed by Artstein-AvidanOstrover).

Introduction and main results

A. Weinstein [55] and P. Rabinowitz [45] proved, respectively, the existence of periodic orbit
on a convex energy surface and a strictly starshaped hypersurface of a Hamiltonian system
in R2n . Based on these, in 1978 A. Weinstein [56] proposed his famous conjecture: every
hypersurface of contact type in the symplectic manifolds carries a closed characteristic. Here
a compact connected smooth hypersurface S in a symplectic manifold (M, ω) is said to be of
contact type if there exists a vector field X defined in an open neighborhood U of S in M
which is transverse to S and such that LX ω = ω in U , and such a vector field X is called
a Liouville field. (All compact manifolds or hypersurfaces in this paper are considered to be
boundaryless without special statements.) A closed characteristic of S is an embedded circle
P ⊂ S satisfying T P = LS |P , where LS → S is a distinguished line bundle defined by
n
o
LS = (x, ξ) ∈ T S ωx (ξ, η) = 0 for all η ∈ Tx S .

In 1986, C.Viterbo [53] first proved the Weinstein conjecture in (R2n , ω0 ) with the global variational methods for periodic solutions of general Hamiltonian systems initiated by P. Rabinowitz
[45, 46] and A. Weinstein [55]. Hereafter ω0 denotes the standard symplectic structure given
P
by i dqi ∧ dpi with the linear coordinates (q1 , · · · , qn , p1 , · · · , pn ).
Motivated by the above studies, I. Ekeland and H. Hofer [20] introduced a class of symplectic invariants (called symplectic capacities) for subsets in (R2n , ω0 ) and reproved the famous
Gromov’s nonsqueezing theorem in [27] and a C 0 rigidity theorem due to Gromov and Eliashberg. H. Hofer and E. Zehnder [30] constructed a symplectic capacity for any symplectic
manifolds, called the Hofer-Zehnder capacity. The second named author [40] introduced the
concept of pseudo symplectic capacities which is a mild generalization of that of symplectic
capacities, constructed a pseudo symplectic capacity as a generalization of the Hofer-Zehnder
capacity and established an estimate for it in terms of Gromov-Witten invariants.
Throughout this paper a compact, convex subset of Rm with nonempty interior is called a
convex body in Rm . As usual, a domain in Rm is a connected open subset of Rm . For r > 0

For a symplectic matrix of order 2n, Ψ ∈ Sp(2n, R), as a generalization of closed characteristics on the boundary S of a compact convex set in (R2n , ω0 ) containing the origin in its interior
Clarke [12, 13] proved: there exists a nonconstant absolutely continuous curve z : [0, T ] → S
for some T > 0 such that J ż(t) ∈ ∂jS (z(t)) a.e. and that z(T ) = Ψz(0). Namely, any (linear)
symplectic transformation is realized on some orbit of any convex energy surface, which was, in
[12, page 356], viewed as a kind of converse to the Goldstein’s famous statement “the motion
of a mechanical system corresponds to the continuous evolution or unfolding of a canonical
(i.e., symplectic) transformation” [26, §8.6]. Our results in Section 1.6 and subsequent papers
will show that this kind of converse holds true in more general cases.
Definition 1.1. (i) For a smooth hypersurface S in a symplectic manifold (M, ω) and
Ψ ∈ Symp(M, ω), a C 1 embedding z from [0, T ] (for some T > 0) into S is called a Ψcharacteristic on S if z(T ) = Ψz(0) and ż(t) ∈ (LS )z(t) ∀t ∈ [0, T ]. Clearly, z(T − ·) is
a Ψ−1 -characteristic, and for any τ > 0 the embedding [0, τ T ] → S, t 7→ z(t/τ ) is also a
Ψ-characteristic.
(ii) If S is the boundary of a convex body D in (R2n , ω0 ), and Ψ ∈ Sp(2n, R), corresponding
to the definition of closed characteristics on S in Definition 1 of [17, Chap.V,§1] we say a
nonconstant absolutely continuous curve z : [0, T ] → R2n (for some T > 0) to be a generalized
characteristic on S if z([0, T ]) ⊂ S and ż(t) ∈ JNS (z(t)) a.e., where NS (x) = {y ∈ R2n | hu −
x, yi ≤ 0 ∀u ∈ D} is the normal cone to D at x ∈ S. Furthermore, we call the z a generalized
Ψ-characteristic on S if z(T ) = Ψz(0).
Clearly, if S in (ii) is also C 1,1 then generalized Ψ-characteristics on S are Ψ-characteristics
up to reparametrization. We define the action of a generalized Ψ-characteristic x : [0, T ] → S
by

S = {A(x) > 0 | x is a generalized Ψ-characteristic on S}.

Hereafter we always use J to denote standard complex structure on R2n , R2n−2 and R2 without
confusions. With the linear coordinates (q1 , · · · , qn , p1 , · · · , pn ) on R2n it is given by the matrix

where In denotes the identity matrix of order n. The above Clarke’s result may be formulated
as: the boundary of a compact convex set D in (R2n , ω0 ) containing the origin in its interior
carries a generalized Ψ-characteristic. Motivated by this and the Weinstein conjecture ([56])
we state the following generalized version of the latter.
Question Ψ. Let S be a hypersurface of contact type in a symplectic manifold (M, ω) and
Ψ ∈ Symp(M, ω) such that S ∩ Fix(Ψ) 6= ∅. What is the condition that there exists a Ψcharacteristic on S ?

3

This question is closely related to the following.
Leaf-wise intersection question: Given a compact hypersurface S and a symplectomorphism Ψ ∈ Symp(M, ω), under what conditions on Ψ and S there exist a point x ∈ S such
that Ψx lies on a leaf LS (x) through x?
Such a question was first addressed by Moser [42]. Since then various forms or generalizations of it were studied. See [19, 16, 25], [1, §1.1] and [34, §1.4] and references therein for the
brief history of these problems.
Actually, the above leaf-wise intersection question for a hypersurface S of contact type
is slightly weaker than Question Ψ. Indeed, it is clear that Ψ-characteristic γ : [0, T ] → S
yields a leaf-wise intersection point γ(0). Conversely, if x is a leaf-wise intersection point,
we take a smooth function H : M → R having S as a regular energy surface, and obtain
LS (x) = {ϕt (x) | t ∈ R} and so Ψ(x) = ϕτ (x) for some τ ∈ R, where ϕt is the Hamiltonian
flow of H. If τ > 0, then [0, τ ] ∋ t → ϕt (x) is a Ψ-characteristic on S. If τ < 0 then
y : [0, −τ ] → S, t 7→ ϕ−t (x) satisfies ẏ(t) = −XH (y(t)) = X−H (y(t)) and so a Ψ-characteristic
on S. However, it is possible that τ = 0, i.e., Ψ(x) = x, and we cannot get a Ψ-characteristic
on S in this case.
As applications of our generalized capacities some answers to Question Ψ and the Leafwise intersection question above are given in Corollaries 1.18,1.19 and Section 1.6. There exist
several methods to study the Weinstein conjecture, which were developed based on pseudoholomorphic curve theory, for example, Gromov-Witten invariants, symplectic (co)homology
and contact homology. Our future work is to develop the corresponding theories matching to
Question Ψ.

1.1

An extension of Hofer-Zehnder symplectic capacity

As the Hofer-Zehnder symplectic capacity may be used to study the Weinstein conjecture we
wish to construct an analogue of it for studies of Question Ψ.
Let us recall the definition of the Hofer-Zehnder symplectic capacity. Given a symplectic
manifold (M, ω) let H(M, ω) denote the set of a smooth function H : M → R for which there
exist an nonempty open subset U = U (H) and a compact subset K = K(H) ⊂ M \ ∂M such
that
(i) H|U = 0,
(ii) H|M\K = m(H) := max H,
(iii) 0 ≤ H ≤ m(H).
Denote by XH the Hamiltonian vector field defined by ω(XH , ·) = dH. A function H ∈
H(M, ω) is called admissible if ẋ = XH (x) has no nonconstant periodic solutions of period
less than 1. Let Had (M, ω) be the set of admissible Hamiltonians on (M, ω). The HoferZehnder symplectic capacity cHZ (M, ω) of (M, ω) was defined in [30] by
cHZ (M, ω) = sup {max H | H ∈ Had (M, ω)} .
This symplectic invariant may establish the existence of closed characteristics on an energy
surface, cHZ (M, ω) < ∞ implies that the Weinstein conjecture holds in (M, ω).
Given a Ψ ∈ Symp(M, ω) with Fix(Ψ) 6= ∅, let
HΨ (M, ω) = {H ∈ H(M, ω) | U ∩ Fix(Ψ) 6= ∅},

4

where U = U (H) is as in (i)-(iii). We call H ∈ HΨ (M, ω) Ψ-admissible if all solutions
x : [0, T ] → M of the Hamiltonian boundary value problem


ẋ = XH (x),
x(T ) = Ψx(0)

(1.4)

with 0 < T ≤ 1 are constant. The set of all such Ψ-admissible Hamiltonians is denoted by
Ψ
Had
(M, ω). As an analogue of the Hofer-Zehnder capacity of (M, ω) we define
Ψ
cΨ
HZ (M, ω) = sup{max H | H ∈ Had (M, ω)}.

(1.5)

Moreover, for an open subset O ⊂ M with O ∩ Fix(Ψ) 6= ∅, we also define
Ψ
cΨ
HZ (O, ω) = sup{max H | H ∈ Had (O, ω)},

(1.6)

Ψ
where Had
(O, ω) consists of H ∈ HΨ (O, ω) such that the boundary value problem (1.4) has a
nonconstant solution x : [0, T ] → O implies T > 1. It is not hard to check that cΨ|O (O, ω) =
cΨ
HZ (O, ω) if Ψ(O) = O, where Ψ|O is viewed as an element in Symp(O, ω). Moreover, if
Ψ
Ψ = idM we have clearly cΨ
HZ (M, ω) = cHZ (M, ω) and cHZ (O, ω) = cHZ (O, ω) for any open
subset O ⊂ M . As cHZ , cΨ
HZ has the inner regularity, i.e., for any precompact open subset
O ⊂ M with O ∩ Fix(Ψ) 6= ∅, we have
Ψ
cΨ
HZ (O, ω) = sup{cHZ (K, ω) | K open, K ∩ Fix(Ψ) 6= ∅, K ⊂ O}.

(1.7)

We make the convention: each symplectic matrix Ψ ∈ Sp(2n, R) is identified with the linear
symplectomorphism on (R2n , ω0 ) which has the representing matrix Ψ under the standard
symplectic basis of (R2n , ω0 ), (e1 , · · · , en , f1 , · · · , fn ), where the i-th coordinate of ei (resp.
fn+i ) is 1 and other coordinates are zero.
For an open set O in (R2n , ω0 ) such that O ∩Fix(Ψ) 6= ∅, we have a well-defined cΨ
HZ (O, ω0 ).
−I2n
Moreover, if O ∋ 0, then c
(O, ω0 ) is invariant for all odd symplectomorphisms on (R2n , ω0 ).
The following (1.28), Theorem 1.15 and Lemma A.1 show
−I2n
−I2n
cHZ
(B 2n (1), ω0 ) = cHZ
(Z 2n (1), ω0 ) = π/2.

Hereafter for R > 0 we write as usual,
Z 2n (R) = {(q, p) ∈ Rn × Rn | q12 + p21 < R2 }
with respect to the symplectic coordinates (q, p) = (q1 , · · · , qn , p1 , · · · , pn ) of (R2n , ω0 ).
Ψ
Proposition 1.2. (i) (Conformality). cΨ
HZ (M, αω) = αcHZ (M, ω) for any α ∈ R>0 , and
Ψ−1
Ψ
cHZ (M, αω) = −αcHZ (M, ω) for any α ∈ R<0 .

(ii) (Monotonicity). Suppose that Ψi ∈ Symp(Mi , ωi ) (i = 1, 2). If there exists a symplectic
embedding φ : (M1 , ω1 ) → (M2 , ω2 ) of codimension zero such that φ ◦ Ψ1 = Ψ2 ◦ φ, then
for open subsets Oi ⊂ Mi with Oi ∩ Fix(Ψi ) 6= ∅ (i = 1, 2) and φ(O1 ) ⊂ O2 , it holds that
Ψ2
1
cΨ
HZ (O1 , ω1 ) ≤ cHZ (O2 , ω2 ).

(iii) (Continuity). For a bounded convex domain A ⊂ R2n , suppose that Ψ ∈ Sp(2n, R)
satisfies A ∩ Fix(Ψ) 6= ∅. Then for every ε > 0 there exists some δ > 0 such that for all
bounded convex domain O ⊂ R2n intersecting with Fix(Ψ), it holds that
Ψ
|cΨ
HZ (O, ω0 ) − cHZ (A, ω0 )| ≤ ε

provided that A and O have the Hausdorff distance dH (A, O) < δ.

5

(1.8)

Proof. (i) and (ii) are easily proved by the definitions. For (iii), let p ∈ A ∩ Fix(Ψ). Replacing
A and O with A − p and O − p respectively, we may assume 0 ∈ A. For any 0 < ǫ ≪ 1, by
[48, Lemma 1.8.14] there exists δ > 0 such that any bounded convex domain O ⊂ R2n with
dH (A, O) < δ satisfies
(1 − ǫ)A ⊂ O ⊂ (1 + ǫ)A.
Then (iii) may easily follow from this and (i)–(ii).
As in [7] we can also get more results on continuity of cΨ
HZ . For example, as in the proof of
[7, Proposition 2.3] we have the following outer regularity of cΨ
HZ . Let S be a smooth connected
compact hypersurface of restricted contact type in R2n with respect to a global Liouville vector
field X on R2n and let BS be the bounded component of R2n \ S. Suppose that Ψ ∈ Sp(2n, R)
satisfies BS ∩ Fix(Ψ) 6= ∅ and that X(Ψ(x)) = Ψ(X(x)) for all x near S. Then
Ψ

is open and BS ⊂ V }.
HZ (BS , ω0 ) = inf{cHZ (V, ω0 ) | V ⊂ R

Clearly Proposition 1.2(ii) shows that cΨ
HZ (M, ω) is invariant for the centralizer of Ψ in
Symp(M, ω), SympΨ (M, ω) := {φ ∈ Symp(M, ω) | φ ◦ Ψ = Ψ ◦ φ} (the stabilizer at Ψ for the
adjoint action on Symp(M, ω)). Moreover, for any Ψ ∈ Symp(M, ω) and any open subset
O ⊂ M with O ∩ Fix(Ψ) 6= ∅, (ii) also implies
−1

cΨ
(Φ(O), ω)
HZ (O, ω) = cHZ

∀Φ ∈ Symp(M, ω).

If Ψ ∈ Sp(2n, R) and O ⊂ (R2n , ω0 ) is an open set containing the origin then (i)-(ii) of
Proposition 1.2 imply

∀α ≥ 0.

Ψ
Ψ
2n
0 ∈ R2n we may define a slight variant of cΨ

H0Ψ (O, ω0 ) := {H ∈ HΨ (O, ω0 ) | H vanishes near 0},
and define
Ψ
cΨ
HZ (O, ω0 ) = sup{max H | H ∈ H0 (O, ω0 ) and H is Ψ-admissible}.

(1.11)

if O∗ ⊇ O is another open subset. Actually, cΨ
HZ (O, ω0 ) = cHZ (O, ω0 ) for any convex open
2n
O ⊂ R containing 0, see Remark 4.11.

Proposition 1.3. For any symplectic matrix Ψ ∈ Sp(2n, R) and an open set O ⊂ R2n containing the origin 0 ∈ R2n , if B 2n (0, r) ⊂ O ⊂ B 2n (0, R) then it holds that

onto R2n by defining H = m(H) outside O. Define G : R2n → R by G(x) = H(x + p). Then
G is equal to m(H) outside K − p and vanishes near 0. Note that

An extension of Ekeland-Hofer capacity

In this subsection, we fix a symplectic matrix Ψ ∈ Sp(2n, R). Define
g Ψ : R → R, s 7→ det(Ψ − esJ ),

(1.13)

P∞ 1 k k
where etJ = k=0 k!
t J . By Lemma A.1 the set of zeros of g Ψ in (0, 2π] is a nonempty finite
set. Let us denote by
t(Ψ)
(1.14)
the smallest zero of g Ψ in (0, 2π]. It is equal to 2π if Ψ = I2n . Via (2.9) we have a sobolev
1
space E = E 2 associated to Ψ. It has orthogonal splitting (2.11).
We closely follow Sikorav’s approach [50] to Ekeland-Hofer capacity in [20].
Definition 1.4. A continuous map γ : E → E is called an admissible deformation if there
exists an homotopy (γu )0≤u≤1 such that γ0 = id, γ1 = γ and satisfies
(i) ∀u ∈ [0, 1], γu (E \ (E − ⊕ E 0 )) = E \ (E − ⊕ E 0 ), i.e. for any x ∈ E such that x+ 6= 0,
there holds γu (x)+ 6= 0.

(ii) γu (x) = a(x, u)x+ + b(x, u)x0 + c(x, u)x− + K(x, u), where (a, b, c, K) is a continuous map
from E × [0, 1] to (0, +∞)3 × E and maps any bounded sets to precompact sets.
Let Γ be the set of all admissible deformations. For H ∈ C 0 (R2n , R+ ) satisfying:

(H1) Int(H −1 (0)) 6= ∅ and contains a fixed point of Ψ,

(H2) there exist z0 ∈ Fix(Ψ), real numbers a > t(Ψ) and b such that H(z) = a|z|2 + hz, z0i+ b
outside a compact subset of R2n ,
we define ΦH : E → R by
ΦH (x) =

and the Ψ-capacity of H by

EH (H) = sup

h∈Γ x∈h(S + )

ΦH (x),

where S + = {x ∈ E + | kxkE = 1}.

(1.16)

Then (H2) implies cΨ
EH (H) < +∞ by Proposition 3.4, and for smooth H the conditions (H1)–
Ψ
(H2) imply cEH (H) > 0 by Proposition 3.5. It is easy to prove the following.

E(R2n , B, Ψ) = {H ∈ F(R2n , B) | H is Ψ-nonresonant}.
Note that each H ∈ E(R2n , B, Ψ) satisfies (H1) and that E(R2n , B, Ψ) is a cofinal family of
F(R2n , B), that is, for any H ∈ F(R2n , B) there exists G ∈ E(R2n , B, Ψ) such that G ≥ H.

Some computation results

The following is an analogue of the representation formula for cHZ due to Hofer and Zehnder
[30, Propposition 4].
Theorem 1.8. Let Ψ ∈ Sp(2n, R) and let D ⊂ R2n be a convex bounded domain with boundary
S = ∂D and contain a fixed point p of Ψ. Then there is a generalized Ψ-characteristic x∗ on
S such that
A(x∗ )

= min{A(x) > 0 | x is a generalized Ψ-characteristic on S}

=

cΨ
HZ (D, ω0 ).

(1.21)
(1.22)

If S is of class C 1,1 , (1.21) and (1.22) become
∗
cΨ
HZ (D, ω0 ) = A(x ) = inf{A(x) > 0 | x is a Ψ-characteristic on S}.

8

(1.23)

A generalized Ψ-characteristic x∗ on S satisfying (1.21)-(1.22) is called a cΨ
HZ -carrier for D.
The proof of Theorem 1.8 also shows that a generalized Ψ-characteristic on S is a cΨ
HZ -carrier for
D if and only if it may be reparametrized as a solution x : [0, T ] → S of −J ẋ∗ (t) ∈ ∂H(x∗ (t))
2
with T = cΨ
HZ (D, ω0 ) and satisfying x(T ) = Ψ(x(0)), where H = jD . Hence from (4.3)
and Arzela-Ascoli theorem it follows that all cΨ
HZ -carriers for D form a compact subset in
0
1
1
C ([0, µ], S) (and C ([0, µ], S) if S is C ), where µ = cΨ
HZ (D, ω0 ).
Clearly, Theorem 1.8 implies Clarke’s main result in [12]. When Ψ = I2n and the boundary
S = ∂D is smooth Hofer and Zehnder [30, Propposition 4] proved Theorem 1.8, and then
Künzle [36, 37, 38] removed the smoothness assumption of S (also see Artstein-Avidan and
Ostrover [5] for a different proof).
Similarly, for cΨ
EH we have the following representation formula, which generalize the one
for cEH in [20, 21, 50].
Theorem 1.9. Let Ψ ∈ Sp(2n, R) and let D ⊂ R2n be a convex bounded domain with C 1,1
boundary S = ∂D and containing a fixed point p of Ψ in the closure of D. Then there exists
a Ψ-characteristic x∗ on ∂D such that
A(x∗ ) =
=

min{A(x) > 0 | x is a Ψ-characteristic on S}
cΨ
EH (D).

(1.24)

Moreover, if both ∂D and D contain fixed points of Ψ, then
Ψ
cΨ
EH (D) = cEH (∂D).

(1.25)

Remark 1.10. As in Section 4.4 an approximation argument shows that the condition “C 1,1 ”
for D in Theorem 1.9 is not needed if “Ψ-characteristic” is replaced by “generalized ΨΨ
characteristic”. Thus this and Theorem 1.8 imply cΨ
EH (D) = cHZ (D, ω0 ) for any convex
2n
bounded domain D ⊂ R containing a fixed point p of Ψ. It follows from the definitions
Ψ

Ψ
special statements. In this case a cΨ
HZ -carrier is also called a cEHZ -carrier.
As a consequence of Theorem 1.8 or Theorem 1.9 we get the following.
Corollary 1.11. Let E(q) := {z ∈ R2n | q(z) < 1} be the ellipsoid given by a positive definite
quadratic form q(z) = 21 hSz, zi on R2n , where S ∈ R2n×2n is a positive definite symmetric
matrix. Then for any Ψ ∈ Sp(2n, R) there holds

2n
cΨ
EHZ (B ) =

t(Ψ)

(1.28)

In fact, since the Hamiltonian vector field of q is Xq (z) = JSz, every Ψ-characteristic on
∂E(q) may be parameterized as the form [0, T ] ∋ t 7→ exp(tJS)z0 ∈ ∂E(q), where q(z0 ) =
1 and exp(T JS)z0 = Ψz0 . Hence (1.26) follows from these and (1.21)-(1.22) immediately.
Obverse that B 2n (1) = E(q) with S = 2I2n . (1.13) and (1.26) lead to (1.28) directly. Since

For integers n1 > 0 and n2 > 0 let n = n1 + n2 . We have a subgroup of Sp(2n, R),

S1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Sk for Si ∈ Sp(2ni , R), i = 1, · · · , k.
As a generalization of [50, Th. 6.6.1] (also see [21, Prop.5] for special cases) we have the
following.
Theorem 1.12. Let Ψ = Ψ1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Ψk , where Ψi ∈ Sp(2ni , R), i = 1, · · · , k. Then for

Note that (1.28) is a generalization for the normality cEH (B 2n (1)) = cHZ (B 2n (1), ω0 ) = π.
In order to get some kind of results similar to the normality cEH (Z 2n (1)) = cHZ (Z 2n (1), ω0 ) = π
we need to make stronger restrictions for the symplectic matrix Ψ ∈ Sp(2n, R).

Here is another important consequence of Theorem 1.8.
Corollary 1.16. Let Ψ ∈ Sp(2n, R) and let D ⊂ R2n be a convex bounded domain with
boundary S = ∂D. Suppose that p ∈ D is a fixed point of Ψ.

(i) If D contains a ball B 2n (p, r), then for any generalized Ψ-characteristic x on S with
positive action it holds that
r2
A(x) ≥ t(Ψ).
(1.43)

0 < A(x⋆ ) ≤

R2
t(Ψ).

(1.44)

When Ψ = I2n and S is of class C 1 , (i) and (ii) were obtained respectively by CrokeWeinstein in [14, Theorem C] and by Ekeland in Proposition 5 of [17, Chap.5,§1]. Then
Künzle [37, 38] removed the C 1 -smoothness assumption of S.
Corollary 1.16 easily follows from the above theorems. In fact, by a translation transformation, (see the beginning of Section 4), we only need to consider the case p = 0. For
2n
Ψ
(i) of Corollary 1.16, B 2n (0, r) ⊂ D implies cΨ
HZ (B (0, r), ω0 ) ≤ cHZ (D, ω0 ). Moreover,
r2
Ψ
2n
Ψ
cHZ (B (0, r), ω0 ) = 2 t(Ψ) by (1.10) and (1.28), and cHZ (D, ω0 ) is equal to the minimum
of actions of all Ψ-characteristics with positive actions on S by Theorem 1.8. Thus (1.43)
follows immediately.
Similarly, for (ii) of Corollary 1.16 we have
Ψ

cΨ
HZ (D, ω0 ) ≤ cHZ (B (0, R), ω0 ) =

By Theorem 1.8 there exists a generalized Ψ-characteristic x∗ on S such that A(x∗ ) =
cΨ
HZ (D, ω0 ).
A compact smooth connected hypersurface S in (R2n , ω0 ) is said of restricted contact
type if there exists a a globally defined Liouville vector field X (i.e. a smooth vector field X
on R2n satisfying LX ω0 = ω0 ) which is transversal to S. The following is a generalization of
[20, Proposition 6].
Theorem 1.17. Let Ψ ∈ Sp(2n, R) and let S be a hypersurface of restricted contact type in
(R2n , ω0 ) that admits a globally defined Liouville vector field X transversal to it such that
X(Ψz) = ΨX(z), ∀z ∈ R2n .

where B is the bounded component of R2n \ S.
Bates [8] extended [20, Proposition 6] to certain domains whose boundaries are not of
restricted contact type. The corresponding generalizations of Theorem 1.17 are also possible.
Corollary 1.18. Under Theorem 1.17 S carries a Ψ-characteristic γ with action cΨ
EH (S), in
particular, there exists a leaf-wise intersection point γ(0) ∈ S for Ψ.
Therefore we get a positive answer to Question Ψ under the assumptions of Theorem 1.17.
For a centrally symmetric hypersurface S of restricted contact type in (R2n , ω0 ), if [0, 1] ∋ t →
Ψt is an isotopy of the identity in Symp(R2n , ω0 ) which is odd, i.e., Ψt (−x) = −Ψt (x) for all
(t, x) ∈ [0, 1] × R2n , Ekeland and Hofer proved in [19] that S carries a leaf-wise intersection
point for Ψ1 . Moreover, if this S is also srar-shaped, Albers and Frauenfelder [2] strengthened
this result and showed that S carries infinitely many leaf-wise intersection points or a leaf-wise
intersection point which sits on a closed characteristic. Hence for any given Ψ ∈ Sp(2n, R),
every centrally symmetric hypersurface of restricted contact type in (R2n , ω0 ) carries a leaf-wise
intersection point for Ψ by Ekeland-Hofer theorem, and every centrally symmetric srar-shaped
hypersurface in (R2n , ω0 ) carries infinitely many infinitely many leaf-wise intersection points
or a leaf-wise intersection point which sits on a closed characteristic by Albers-Frauenfelder

13

theorem. Clearly, the last two claims cannot be derived from Theorem 1.17. For a hypersurface
S of restricted contact type in (R2n , ω0 ) and a Ψ ∈ Hamc (R2n , ω0 ), Hofer [28] showed that
S carries a leaf-wise intersection point if Ψ has Hofer’s norm kΨkH ≤ cEH (S). The final
restriction on norm kΨkH is not needed if the Rabinowitz Floer homology of (R2n , S) does not
vanish by [1, Theorem C]. In conclusion, Corollary 1.18 cannot be included in past results.
Corollary 1.18 implies the following generalization of the main result in [45] if the surfaces
considered therein are smooth.
Corollary 1.19. Let Ψ ∈ Sp(2n, R2n ) and let S ⊂ (R2n , ω0 ) be a smooth star-shaped hypersurface with respect to a fixed point p of Ψ, that is, p is an interior point of the bounded part
surrounded by S and has the property that every ray issuing from the point p intersects S in
exactly one point and does so transversally. Then S carries a Ψ-characteristic with action
cΨ
EH (S), in particular, a leaf-wise intersection point for Ψ.
Indeed, let φ be the symplectomorphism in (4.1), which commutes with Ψ. Then φ(S) is
a star-shaped hypersurface with respect to the origin. As in the proof of Theorem 1.8 φ maps
Ψ-characteristics on S onto such characteristics on φ(S) in one-to-one and preserving-action
way. Hence we can assume that S is a star-shaped hypersurface with respect to the origin.
Then S is a hypersurface of restricted contact type in (R2n , ω0 ) that admits a globally defined
Liouville vector field X given by X(x) = x2 for x ∈ R2n . Clearly, X satisfies (1.45), and hence
Corollary 1.18 yields Corollary 1.19.
Recently, Ekeland proposed a very closely related problem [18, Problem 4, §5], which may
be formulated as follows in our notations.
Problem E. Finally, what about general Hamiltonians H on R2n , assuming simply H(0) = 0
and H(x) → ∞ when |x| → ∞, so that energy surfaces H(x) = h are bounded, and the
boundary-value problem (1.4) with Ψ ∈ Sp(2n, R) is reasonable?
If H −1 (a) is regular and star-shaped, Corollary 1.19 implies that either the BVP (1.4) or
ẋ = XH (x)

&

x(T ) = Ψ−1 x(0)

has a solution on H −1 (a)).

An extension of a theorem by Evgeni Neduv

For a proper and strictly convex Hamiltonian H ∈ C 2 (R2n , R+ ) such that H(0) = 0 and
H′′ > 0, (which imply H ≥ 0 by the Taylor’s formula), if e0 ≥ 0 is a regular value of H
with H−1 (e0 ) 6= ∅, the set D(e) := {H < e} is a strictly convex bounded domain in R2n
with 0 ∈ D(e) and with C 2 -boundary S(e) = H−1 (e) for each number e near e0 . Based
on [30, Propposition 4] (i.e., Theorem 1.8 with Ψ = I2n ) Evgeni Neduv [44] studied the
differentiability of the Hofer-Zehnder capacity cHZ (D(e)) at e = e0 and obtained some applications to the prescribed periodic problems. Given a Ψ ∈ Sp(2n, R), for any e near e0
Ψ
let C(e) := cΨ
HZ (D(e), ω0 ). As remarked below Theorem 1.8 all cHZ -carriers for D(e) form a

y : [0, Tx] → S(e) = H−1 (e) such that y(Tx ) = Ψy(0) and y(T ) 6= Ψy(0) for any T ∈ (0, Tx ),
that is, Tx is the minimal period of y if Ψ = I2n . The following is our generalization for [44,
Theorem 4.4].
Theorem 1.20. Let Ψ ∈ Sp(2n, R) and let H ∈ C 2 (R2n , R+ ) be as above. Then C(e) has the
left and right derivatives at e0 , C′− (e0 ) and C′+ (e0 ), and they satisfy
C′− (e0 ) = lim T max (e0 + ǫ) = T max (e0 )
ǫ→0−

and

C′+ (e0 ) = lim T min(e0 + ǫ) = T min(e0 ).
ǫ→0+

Moreover, if [a, b] ⊂ (0, sup H) is an regular interval of H such that C′+ (a) < C′− (b), then
for any r ∈ (C′+ (a), C′− (b)) there exist e′ ∈ (a, b) such that C(e) is differentiable at e′ and
C′− (e′ ) = C′+ (e′ ) = r = T max(e′ ) = T min(e′ ).
As a monotone function on an regular interval [a, b] of H as above, C(e) satisfies C′− (e) =
C′+ (e) for almost all values of e ∈ [a, b] and thus both T max and T min are almost everywhere
continuous. Actually, the first claim of Theorem 1.20 and a recent result [9, Corollary 6.4]
imply that both T max and T min have only at most countable discontinuous points and are also
Riemann integrable on [a, b].
By Theorem 1.20, for any regular interval [a, b] ⊂ (0, sup H) of H with C′+ (a) ≤ C′− (b), if
T ∈ [C′+ (a), C′− (b)] then (1.47) has a solution y : [0, T ] → H−1 ([a, b]) such that y(T ) = Ψy(0)
and y(T ′ ) 6= Ψy(0) for any T ′ ∈ (0, T ). For example, we have

Corollary 1.21. Suppose that a proper and strictly convex Hamiltonian H ∈ C 2 (R2n , R+ )
satisfies the conditions:
(i) H(0) = 0, H′′ > 0 and every e > 0 is a regular value of H,
(ii) there exist two positive definite symmetric matrixes S0 , S∞ ∈ R2n×2n such that
inf{t > 0 | det(exp(tJS0 ) − Ψ) 6= 0} ≤ inf{t > 0 | det(exp(tJS∞ ) − Ψ) 6= 0}
and that H(x) is equal to q(x) :=
(resp. large) enough.

(resp. Q(x) :=

Then for every T between the two numbers in (1.48) the corresponding system (1.47) has a
solution y : [0, T ] → R2n such that y(T ) = Ψy(0) and y(T ′ ) 6= Ψy(0) for any T ′ ∈ (0, T ).
Indeed, if e > 0 is small (resp. large) enough then D(e) is equal to Dq (e) := {q < e} =

1.5 A Brunn-Minkowski inequality for cΨ
EHZ -capacity of convex domains
Artstein-Avidan and Ostrover [4] established a Brunn-Minkowski type inequality for symplectic capacities of convex domains. For a nonempty closed convex subset K ⊂ R2n the associated
support function is defined by
hK (w) = sup{hx, wi | x ∈ K},

15

∀w ∈ R2n .

(1.49)

If K is also compact and contains 0 in its interior, and K ◦ = {x ∈ R2n | hx, yi ≤ 1 ∀y ∈ K} is
its polar body, then hK and (hK )2 are equal to the gauge function jK ◦ (cf. [48, Theorem 1.7.6])
∗
and the four times of the Legendre transform HK
of HK := (jK )2 (see (9.2)), respectively.
2n
For two compact convex subsets D, K ⊂ R containing 0 in their interiors and a real number
p ≥ 1, there exists a unique compact convex subset D +p K ⊂ R2n with support function
1

R2n ∋ w 7→ hD+p K (w) = (hpD (w) + hpK (w)) p

(1.50)

([48, Theorem 1.7.1]), D +p K is called the p-sum of D and K by Firey (cf. [48, (6.8.2)]).
When Ψ = I2n Artstein-Avidan and Ostrover first proved the following result in [4, 5].
Theorem 1.22. Let D, K ⊂ R2n be two compact convex subsets containing 0 in their interiors.
Then for any Ψ ∈ Sp(2n, R) and any real p ≥ 1 it holds that

Moreover, the equality holds if there exist cΨ
EHZ -carriers for D and K, γD : [0, T ] → ∂D
and γK : [0, T ] → ∂K, such that they coincide up to dilation and translation by elements in
Ker(Ψ − I2n ), i.e., γD = αγK + b for some α ∈ R \ {0} and b ∈ Ker(Ψ − I2n ) ⊂ R2n ; and in
the case p > 1 the latter condition is also necessary for the equality in (1.51) holding.
Since D +1 K = D + K = {x + y | x ∈ D & y ∈ K} we have the following.
Corollary 1.23. Let Ψ ∈ Sp(2n, R), and let D, K ⊂ R2n be two compact convex subsets
containing fixed points of Ψ in their interiors. Then

Corollary 1.24. Let D, K and Ψ be as in Corollary 1.23.

Applications to Hamiltonian dynamics

Recall that a thickening of a compact and regular energy surface S = {x ∈ M | H(x) = 0} in a
symplectic manifold (M, ω) is an open and bounded neighborhood U of S which is filled with
compact and regular energy surfaces having energy values near E = 0, that is,
[
U=
Sλ ,
(1.56)
λ∈I

where I = (−ε, ε) and where Sλ = {x ∈ U | H(x) = λ} is diffeomorphic to the given surface
S = S0 for each λ ∈ I. As a generalization of [31, p. 106, Theorem 1] we have:
Theorem 1.25. Let S , Sλ and U described as above, and let Ψ ∈ Symp(M, ω). Assume that
S ∩ Fix(Ψ) 6= ∅ and that cΨ
HZ (U, ω) < ∞. Then exists a sequence λj → 0 such that there is an
Ψ-characteristic on energy surface Sλj for all λj .
The proof is standard. Pick an ε0 ∈ (0, ε) and a C ∞ function f : R → R≥0 such that
f (s) = cΨ
HZ (U, ω) + 1 for ε0 < |s| < ε,
f ′ (s) < 0 for − ε0 < s < −

,
2

f (s) = 0 for
f ′ (s) > 0 for

|s| <

ε0
,
2

ε0
< s < ε0 .

Let F (x) = f (H(x)) for x ∈ U . Note that S = S0 satisfies S∩Fix(Ψ) 6= ∅. Hence F ∈ HΨ (U, ω)
Ψ
with m(F ) = cΨ
HZ (U, ω) + 1. By the definition of cHZ (U, ω) there exists a nonconstant smooth
curve x : [0, 1] → R2n satisfying ẋ = XF (x(t)) = f ′ (H(x(t)))XH (x(t)) and x(1) = Ψx(0).
Clearly H(x(t)) is constant and x is a Ψ-characteristic sitting on Sε′ , where ε0 /2 < ε′ < ε0 .
By choosing ε0 sufficiently small, Theorem 1.25 follows.
Corollary 1.26. Let Ψ ∈ Symp(M, ω) and let S ⊂ (M, ω) be a hypersurface of restricted
contact type that admits a globally defined Liouville vector field X satisfying X(Ψ(x)) =
dΨ(x)[X(x)] for all x ∈ M . If S ∩ Fix(Ψ) 6= ∅ and cΨ
HZ (U, ω) < +∞ for some neighborhood U of S then there exists a Ψ-characteristic on S.
Indeed, let φt denote the local flow of the Liouville vector field X. Since S is compact and
X is transversal to S, there exists a sufficiently small ε > 0 such that the map
ψ : S × (−2ε, 2ε) → U ⊂ M, (x, t) 7→ φt (x)
is a differomorphism (by shrinking U if necessary), and that φt (Ψ(x)) = Ψ(φt (x)) for all
(t, x) ∈ (−2ε, 2ε) × S because of X(Ψ(x)) = dΨ(x)[X(x)] for all x ∈ M . Define H : U → R by
H(x) = λ if x = ψ(y, λ) ∈ U . Let Sλ = H −1 (λ) = ψ(S ×{λ}) for λ ∈ (−ε, ε). By Theorem 1.25

17

there exists λ ∈ (−ε, ε) arbitrarily close to 0 such that Sλ carries a Ψ-characteristic y. Note
that dφλ : LS → LSλ is a bundle isomorphism. From these we derive that x(t) = φ−ν y(t) is a
Ψ-characteristic on S. See the arguments above Proposition 6.2 for details.
Clearly, Corollary 1.26 may be applied to (M, ω) = (R2n , ω0 ) and Ψ ∈ Sp(2n, R). But the
result obtained is weaker than Theorem 1.17.
The same assumptions as under Theorem 1.25 may yield the following result for the leafwise intersection question.
Theorem 1.27. Under the assumptions of Theorem 1.25 the following holds:
(i) There exists a subset ∆ ⊂ (0, ε) of full Lebesgue measure m(∆) = ε such that for every
δ ∈ ∆ either Sδ ∪ S−δ contains a fixed point of Ψ, or Sδ carries a Ψ-characteristic
y : [0, T ] → Sδ satisfying ẏ = XH (y) or S−δ carries a Ψ-characteristic y : [0, T ] → S−δ
satisfying ẏ = −XH (y). (If Ψ has only finite fixed points in U , ∆ may be chosen so that
the first case does not occur.)
(ii) There exists a subset Λ ⊂ I \ {0} of full Lebesgue measure m(Λ) = m(I) such that for
every nonzero parameter λ ∈ Λ the associated energy surface Sλ carries either a fixed
point of Ψ or a Ψ-characteristic y : [0, T ] → Sλ satisfying ẏ = XH (y) or ẏ = −XH (y).
(If Ψ has only finite fixed points in U , Λ may be chosen so that the first case does not
occur.) Consequently, each Sλ with λ ∈ Λ carries a leaf-wise intersection point for Ψ.
Clearly, the above two theorems cannot be contained each other. When Ψ = idM the
Ψ-characteristics become closed characteristics and Hofer and Zehnder showed in [31, p. 118,
Theorem 4] that for some subset Λ ⊂ I of full Lebesgue measure m(Λ) = m(I) every energy
surface Sλ with λ ∈ Λ carries a closed characteristic, provided S ⊂ M bounds a compact
symplectic manifold. Macarini and Schlenk in [41] removed out the last additional assumption.
(Actually, when (M, ω) = (R2n , ω0 ) and Ψ = idR2n Struwe [51] refined the arguments by Hofer
and Zehnder [29] to prove such a result in 1990.) Theorem 1.27 can be viewed as a partial
generalization of the result in [41].
Corollary 1.28. Let 0 be a regular value of H ∈ C 2 (R2n ) such that S := H −1 (0) is compact
and connected, and let U = ∪λ∈I Sλ , where I = (−ε, ε) and Sλ = {x ∈ R2n | H(x) = λ}, be
a thickening of S in (R2n , ω0 ). Suppose that Ψ ∈ Sp(2n, R) and S ∩ Fix(Ψ) 6= ∅. Then the
corresponding conclusions to those of Theorem 1.27 hold.
Since S is compact, there exists sufficiently large R > 0 such that U ⊂ B 2n (R). By the
monotonicity and positive conformality property of the capacity cΨ
HZ together with (1.28), we
Ψ
Ψ
2n
2
get that cHZ (U, ω0 ) ≤ cHZ (B (R), ω0 ) ≤ 2R t(Ψ). Corollary 1.28 follows.
As a generalization of Struwe’s main result of [51], we have the following result which is
stronger than Corollary 1.28.
Theorem 1.29. Let Ψ ∈ Sp(2n, R) and let 1 be a regular value of H ∈ C 2 (R2n ). Suppose
S := H −1 (1) is compact and connected, and that the bounded component of R2n \ S contains
a fixed point of Ψ. (Thus there exists δ0 > 0 be such that each β ∈ [1 − δ0 , 1 + δ0 ] is a
regular value of H and Sβ := H −1 (β) is diffeomorphic to S = S1 .) Let γ be the diameter
of H −1 ([1 − δ0 , 1 + δ0 ]). Then for almost every β ∈ (1 − δ0 , 1 + δ0 ) the associated energy
surface Sβ := H −1 (β) carries a Ψ-characteristic y satisfying ż = XH (z) and with action
0 < A(y) < 16t(Ψ)γ 2 .
Remark 1.30. Recently, Ginzburg and Gürel [25] showed that there exists a closed, smooth
hypersurface S ⊂ R2n , 2n ≥ 4, and a sequence of C ∞ -smooth autonomous Hamiltonian
Fk → 0 in C 0 , supported in the same compact set, such that S and ϕFk (S) have no leafwise
intersections. It suggests that Theorem 1.29 is best possible in one sense.

Applications to billiards dynamics

Recently, Artstein-Avidan, Karasev and Ostrover [5, 6] used the Ekeland-Hofer-Zehnder symplectic capacity to obtain several very interesting bounds and inequalities for the length of the
shortest periodic billiard trajectory in a smooth convex body in Rn . Our above generalizations for the Ekeland-Hofer-Zehnder symplectic capacity allow us to prove some corresponding
results for a larger class of billiard trajectories in a smooth convex body in Rn .
Definition 1.31. For a connected bounded open subset Ω ⊂ Rn with boundary ∂Ω of class
C 2 and A ∈ SO(n, Rn ), a nonconstant, continuous, and piecewise C ∞ path σ : [0, T ] → Ω with
σ(T ) = Aσ(0) is called an A-billiard trajectory in Ω if there exists a finite set Bσ ⊂ (0, T )
such that σ̈ ≡ 0 on (0, T ) \ Bσ and the following conditions are also satisfied:
(ABi) ♯Bσ ≥ 1 and σ(t) ∈ ∂Ω ∀t ∈ Bσ .

(ABii) For each t ∈ Bσ , σ̇ ± (t) := limτ →t± σ̇(τ ) fulfils the equation
σ̇ + (t) + σ̇ − (t) ∈ Tσ(t) ∂Ω,

σ̇ + (t) − σ̇ − (t) ∈ (Tσ(t) ∂Ω)⊥ \ {0}.

(1.57)

(So |σ̇ + (t)|2 − |σ̇ − (t)|2 = hσ̇ + (t) + σ̇ − (t), σ̇ + (t) − σ̇ − (t)iRn = 0 for each t ∈ Bσ , that is,
|σ̇| is constant on (0, T ) \ Bσ .) Let
σ̇ + (0) = lim σ(t)

and σ̇ − (T ) = lim σ(t).

t→0+

(1.58)

t→T −

If σ(0) ∈ ∂Ω (resp. σ(T ) ∈ ∂Ω) let σ̇ − (0) (resp. σ̇ + (T )) be the unique vector satisfying
σ̇ + (0) + σ̇ − (0) ∈ Tσ(0) ∂Ω,

σ̇ + (0) − σ̇ − (0) ∈ (Tσ(0) ∂Ω)⊥

(1.59)

(resp.
σ̇ + (T ) + σ̇ − (T ) ∈ Tσ(T ) ∂Ω,

σ̇ + (T ) − σ̇ − (T ) ∈ (Tσ(T ) ∂Ω)⊥ .

)

(1.60)

(ABiii) If {σ(0), σ(T )} ∈ intΩ then
Aσ̇ + (0) = σ̇ − (T ).

(1.61)

(ABiv) If σ(0) ∈ ∂Ω and σ(T ) ∈ intΩ, then either (1.61) holds, or
Aσ̇ − (0) = σ̇ − (T ).

(1.62)

(ABv) If σ(0) ∈ intΩ and σ(T ) ∈ ∂Ω, then either (1.61) holds, or
Aσ̇ + (0) = σ̇ + (T ).

(1.63)

(ABvi) If {σ(0), σ(T )} ∈ ∂Ω, then either (1.61) or (1.62) or (1.63) holds, or
Aσ̇ − (0) = σ̇ + (T ).

(1.64)

Clearly, if A = In , an A-billiard trajectory becomes periodic (or closed). In fact, the cases
(ABiv) and (ABv) do not occur. Moreover, if (ABiii) holds then all bounce times of this
periodic billiard trajectory σ consist of elements of Bσ . If σ(0) = σ(T ) ∈ ∂Ω and either (1.61)
or (1.64) holds then the periodic billiard trajectory σ is tangent to ∂Ω at σ(0), and so the set
of its bounce times is also Bσ since (1.64) and (1.59)-(1.60) imply that σ̇ + (0) = σ̇ − (T ). When
σ(0) = σ(T ) ∈ ∂Ω and either (1.62) or (1.63) holds, it follows from (1.59)-(1.60) that
σ̇ + (0) + σ̇ − (T ) ∈ Tσ(0) ∂Ω

and σ̇ + (0) − σ̇ − (T ) ∈ (Tσ(0) ∂Ω)⊥ .

These mean that the set of all bounce times of this periodic billiard trajectory σ is either Bσ
or Bσ ∪ {0} = Bσ ∪ {T } (because 0 and T are identified).
If A 6= In , a A-billiard trajectory in Ω might not be periodic even if σ(0) = σ(T ).
The existence of A-billiard trajectories in Ω will be studied in other places.

Definition 1.32. For a convex body in ∆ ⊂ Rn , an outward support vector of it at q ∈ ∂∆ is
a vector ν such that hx − q, νiRn ≤ 0 for all x ∈ ∆. It is unique if q is a smooth point of ∂∆.
Given A ∈ SO(n, Rn ), corresponding to the generalized periodic billiard trajectory introduced
by Ghomi [24], we define a generalized A-billiard trajectory in ∆ to be a finite sequence
of points in ∆
q = q0 , q1 , · · · , qm = Aq
with the following properties:
(AGBi) m ≥ 2 and {q1 , · · · , qm−1 } ⊂ ∂∆.

(AGBii) Both q0 , · · · , qm−1 and q1 , · · · , qm are sequences of distinct points.
(AGBiii) For every i = 1, · · · , m − 1,

νi :=

qi − qi−1
qi − qi+1

kqi − qi−1 k kqi − qi+1 k

is an outward support vector of ∆ at qi ; there exist unit vectors b0 , bm ∈ Rn such that

and νm :=

(1.65)

are outward support vectors of ∆ at q0 and qm , respectively.

(1.68)

(AGBvii) If {q, Aq} ⊂ ∂∆, then either (1.66) or (1.67) or (1.68) holds, or
Ab0 = bm .

(1.69)

As in the arguments under (1.64) a generalized In -billiard trajectory in ∆ is exactly a
generalized periodic billiard trajectory in the sense of [24].
Remark 1.33. For a smooth convex body in ∆ ⊂ Rn and A ∈ SO(n, Rn ), a nonconstant,
continuous, and piecewise C ∞ path σ : [0, T ] → ∆ with σ(T ) = Aσ(0) is an A-billiard
trajectory in ∆ with Bσ = {t1 < · · · < tm−1 } if and only if the sequence
q0 = σ(0), q1 = σ(t1 ), · · · , qm−1 = σ(tm−1 ), qm = σ(T )
is a generalized A-billiard trajectory in ∆.
Suppose that ∆ ⊂ Rnq and Λ ⊂ Rnp are two smooth convex bodies containing the origin in
their interiors. Then ∆ × Λ is only a smooth manifold with corners ∂∆ × ∂Λ in the standard
symplectic space (R2n , ω0 ) = (Rnq × Rnp , dq ∧ dp). Note that ∂(∆ × Λ) = (∂∆ × ∂Λ) ∪ (Int(∆) ×
∂Λ) ∪ (∂∆ × Int(Λ)). Since j∆×Λ (q, p) = max{j∆ (q), jΛ (p)},

(0, ∇jΛ (p)) ∀(q, p) ∈ Int(∆) × ∂Λ,
∇j∆×Λ (q, p) =
(∇j∆ (q), 0) ∀(q, p) ∈ ∂∆ × Int(Λ)

20

and thus
X(q, p) := J∇j∆×Λ (q, p) =



(−∇jΛ (p), 0) ∀(q, p) ∈ Int(∆) × ∂Λ,
(0, ∇j∆ (q)) ∀(q, p) ∈ ∂∆ × Int(Λ).

It is well-known that every A ∈ GL(n, Rn ) induces a natural linear symplectomorphism
ΨA : Rnq × Rnp → Rnq × Rnp , (q, v) 7→ (Aq, (At )−1 v),

(1.70)

where At is the transpose of A.
As a generalization of [5, Definition 2.9], we introduce
Definition 1.34. Under the above assumptions, a continuous and piecewise smooth map
γ : [0, T ] → ∂(∆ × Λ) with γ(T ) = ΨA γ(0) is called an A − (∆, Λ) billiard trajectory if
(BT1) for some positive constant κ it holds that γ̇(t) = κX(γ(t)) on [0, T ] \ γ −1 (∂∆ × ∂Λ);

(BT2) γ has a right derivative γ̇ + (t) at any t ∈ γ −1 (∂∆ × ∂Λ) \ {T } and a left derivative
γ̇ − (t) at any t ∈ γ −1 (∂∆ × ∂Λ) \ {0}, and γ̇ ± (t) belong to
{−λ(∇jΛ (γp (t)), 0) + µ(0, ∇j∆ (γq (t))) | λ ≥ 0, µ ≥ 0, (λ, µ) 6= (0, 0)}

(1.71)

with γ(t) = (γq (t), γp (t)).
Moreover, for a given A ∈ GL(n, Rn ) and two smooth convex bodies ∆ ⊂ Rnq and Λ ⊂ Rnp
satisfying
Fix(A) ∩ Int(∆) 6= ∅ and Fix(At ) ∩ Int(Λ) 6= ∅,
(1.72)
a continuous and piecewise smooth map γ : [0, T ] → ∂(∆ × Λ) is said to be an A − (∆, Λ)
billiard trajectory if there exist q̄ ∈ Fix(A) ∩ Int(∆) and p̄ ∈ Fix(At ) ∩ Int(Λ) such that
γ − (q̄, p̄) is a A − (∆ − q̄, Λ − p̄) billiard trajectory in the above sense. (That is, γ − (q̄, p̄) is
the composition of γ and the affine linear symplectomorphism
Φ(q̄,p̄) : Rnq × Rnp → Rnq × Rnp , (u, v) 7→ (u − q̄, v − p̄),

(1.73)

which commutes with ΨA .) Such an A − (∆, Λ) billiard trajectory is called proper (resp.
gliding) if γ −1 (∂∆ × ∂Λ) is a finite set (resp. [0, T ], i.e., γ([0, T ]) ⊂ ∂∆ × ∂Λ completely).
The following will be proved in Section 10.
Claim 1.35. Let A, ∆ and Λ be as in (1.72). Then every proper A − (∆, Λ) billiard trajectory
γ : [0, T ] → ∂(∆ × Λ) cannot be contained in ∆ × ∂Λ or ∂∆ × Λ. Consequently, γ −1 (∂∆ × ∂Λ)
contains at least a point in (0, T ).
In the first claim, if “proper” is dropped then “∆ × ∂Λ or ∂∆ × Λ” should be changed into
“Int(∆) × ∂Λ or ∂∆ × Int(Λ)”.
As in the proof of [5, Proposition 2.12] we have
Claim 1.36. Let A, ∆ and Λ be as in (1.72). If both ∆ and Λ are also strictly convex (i.e.,
they have strictly positive Gauss curvatures at every point of their boundaries), then every
A − (∆, Λ) billiard trajectory is either proper or gliding.
The first two claims of the following with A = In was showed in [5, (7)].
Claim 1.37. Let A, ∆ and Λ be as in (1.72). If γ : [0, T ] → ∂(∆ × Λ) is a proper A − (∆, Λ)
billiard trajectory with γ −1 (∂∆ × ∂Λ) ∩ (0, T ) = {t1 < · · · < tm }, then the action of γ is given
by

(1.74)
A(γ) =
j=0

21

with qj = πq (γ(tj )), j = 0, · · · , m + 1, where t0 = 0, tm+1 = T and qm+1 = Aq0 . In particular,
if Λ = B n (τ ) for τ > 0 and L(πq (γ)) denotes the length of the projection of γ in ∆ then
A(γ) = τ

m
X
j=0

kqj+1 − qj k = τ L(πq (γ))

(1.75)

since Λ◦ = τ1 B n and thus hΛ = jΛ◦ = τ k · k. Moreover, if ∆ is strictly convex, then the action
of any gliding A − (∆, B n ) billiard trajectory γ : [0, T ] → ∂(∆ × B n ) is also equal to the length
of the projection πq (γ) in ∆.
This and the following two claims will be proved in Section 10.
Claim 1.38. Let A, ∆ and Λ be as in (1.72). γ : [0, T ] → ∂(∆ × Λ) is an A − (∆, Λ) billiard
trajectory if and only if it is a generalized ΨA characteristic on ∂(∆ × Λ).
Claim 1.39. For a smooth convex body in ∆ ⊂ Rn and A ∈ SO(n, Rn ) satisfying Fix(A) ∩
Int(∆) 6= ∅, every A-billiard trajectory in ∆, σ : [0, T ] → ∆, is the projection to ∆ of a proper
A − (∆, B n ) billiard trajectory whose action is equal to the length of σ.
However, under the assumptions of Claim 1.39 we cannot affirm that the projection to ∆
of a proper A − (∆, B n ) billiard trajectory is an A-billiard trajectory in ∆.
Claim 1.38 and Theorem 1.8 leads to
Theorem 1.40. For A ∈ GL(n, Rn ) and smooth convex bodies ∆ ⊂ Rnq and Λ ⊂ Rnp satisfying
(1.72), there is an A − (∆, Λ) billiard trajectory γ ∗ on ∂(∆ × Λ) such that
A

ΨA
A
n
A
ξΛA (∆) = cΨ
EHZ (∆ × Λ) and ξ (∆) = cEHZ (∆ × B ).

(1.76)

If A = In then ξ A (∆) becomes ξ(∆) defined in [5, page 177]. Clearly, ξΛA1 (∆1 ) ≤ ξΛA2 (∆2 ) if
both are well-defined and Λ1 ⊂ Λ2 and ∆1 ⊂ ∆2 . Claim 1.39 and Theorem 1.40 yield
Claim 1.41. Under the assumptions of Claim 1.39 it holds that
ξ A (∆) ≤ inf{L(σ) | σ is an A-billiard trajectory in ∆}.
When A = In and ∆ is strictly convex, it was stated in the bottom of [5, page 177] that
ξ A (∆) is equal to the length of the shortest periodic (Euclidean) billiard trajectory in ∆ if the
gliding trajectories are also considered.
As in the proof of [5, Theorem 1.1] using Corollary 1.23 we may derive
Theorem 1.42. For A ∈ GL(n, Rn ), suppose that convex bodies ∆1 , ∆2 ⊂ Rnq and Λ ⊂ Rnp
satisfy Int(∆1 ) ∩ Fix(A) 6= ∅, Int(∆2 ) ∩ Fix(A) 6= ∅ and Int(Λ) ∩ Fix(At ) 6= ∅. Then
ξΛA (∆1 + ∆2 ) ≥ ξΛA (∆1 ) + ξΛA (∆2 )

(1.77)

A
and the equality holds if there exist cΨ
EHZ -carriers for ∆1 × Λ and ∆2 × Λ which coincide up to
dilation and translation by elements in Ker(ΨA − I2n ).

When A = In , this was first proved in [5], and Irie also gave a new proof of (1.77) in [33].

22

Theorem 1.43. For A ∈ GL(n, Rn ) and a convex body ∆ ⊂ Rnq we have:
(i) If ∆ contains a ball B n (q̄, r) with Aq̄ = q̄, then
n
n
A
ξ A (∆) ≥ rcΨ

(1.78)

In particular, if this ∆ is smooth and A ∈ SO(n, Rn ) then (by Claim 1.41)
rt(ΨA )
≤ inf{L(σ) | σ is an A-billiard trajectory in ∆}.
2

(1.79)

(ii) If ∆ is contained in the closure of the ball B n (q̄, R) with Aq̄ = q̄ ∈ Int(∆), then
ξ A (∆) ≤ t(ΨA )R.

(1.80)

Remark 1.44. By Lemma A.5, t(ΨA ) is equal to the smallest zero in (0, 2π] of the function
R → R, s 7→ det(In + (At )−1 A − cos s(A + (At )−1 )).
(It must exist!) Moreover, if A is an orthogonal matrix similar to one of form (A.2), then
t(ΨA ) is equal to θ1 if m > 0, to π if m = 0 and l > 0, and to 2π if m = l = 0.
Recall that the inradius of a convex body ∆ ⊂ Rnq is the radius of the largest ball
contained in ∆, i.e., inradius(∆) = supx∈∆ dist(x, ∂∆). For any centrally symmetric convex
body ∆ ⊂ Rnq , Artstein-Avidan, Karasev, and Ostrover recently proved in [6, Theorem 1.7]:
cHZ (∆ × ∆◦ , ω0 ) = 4.

(1.81)

As a consequence of this and Theorem 1.43 we have
Corollary 1.45 (Ghomi [24]). Every periodic billiard trajectory σ in a centrally symmetric
convex body ∆ ⊂ Rnq has length L(σ) ≥ 4 inradius(∆).
A
Proof. Since cΨ
HZ = cHZ for A = In , from (1.78) and (1.81) we deduce

ξ(∆) := ξ In (∆) ≥ 4 inradius(∆).

(1.82)

When ∆ is smooth, since ξ(∆) is equal to the length of the shortest periodic billiard trajectory
in ∆ (see the bottom of [5, page 177]), we get L(σ) ≥ 4 inradius(∆). (In this case another new
proof of [24, Theorem 1.2] was also given by Irie [33, Theorem 1.9].) For general case we may
approximate ∆ by a smooth convex body ∆∗ ⊇ ∆ such that σ is also periodic billiard trajectory
∆∗ . Thus L(σ) ≥ ξ(∆∗ ) ≥ ξ(∆) ≥ 4 inradius(∆) because of monotonicity of cHZ .
Corollary 1.45 only partially recover [24, Theorem 1.2] by Ghomi. [24, Theorem 1.2] did
not require ∆ to be centrally symmetric, it also stated that L(σ) = 4 inradius(∆) for some σ
if and only if width(∆) = 4 inradius(∆).
When A = In we may take r = inradius(∆) in (1.79), and get a weaker result than
Corollary 1.45: L(σ) ≥ πinradius(∆) for every periodic billiard trajectory σ in ∆. In order to
get a corresponding result for ξ A as in Corollary 1.45, an analogue of (1.82) is needed. Hence
we expect that (1.81) has the following generalization:

t(ΨA ).

ξ(∆) = L(σ) for some periodic billiard trajectory σ in ∆ provided that periodic billiard
trajectories in ∆ include projections to ∆ of periodic gliding billiard trajectories in ∆ × B n .
It follows from Theorem 1.43(ii) that ξ(∆) = ξ In (∆) ≤ πdiam(∆). Hence
L(σ) ≤ πdiam(∆).

(1.94)

This may be viewed as an improvement for (1.90) in the case that Ω is a smooth convex body.

Variational frame and related preparations

In this section we shall give our variational frame by suitably modifying those in [29, 20, 30, 31].
For the sake of completeness some corresponding conclusions are also proved in details though
part of them appeared in [15] in different forms.
For a given symplectic matrix Ψ ∈ Sp(2n, R), consider the Hilbert subspace of H 1 ([0, 1], R2n ),
X = {x ∈ H 1 ([0, 1], R2n )|x(1) = Ψx(0)}.
Since Cc∞ ((0, 1)) ⊂ X is dense in L2 ([0, 1], R2n ) (cf. [10, Cor.4.23]), so is X in L2 ([0, 1], R2n ).
Consider the unbounded linear operator on L2 ([0, 1], R2n ) with domain dom(Λ) = X,
Λ := −J

d
,
dt

(2.1)

which is also a bounded linear operator from X to L2 ([0, 1], R2n ). Denote by E1 ⊂ R2n the
eigenvector space which belongs to eigenvalue 1 of Ψ. By identifying a ∈ E1 with the
constant path in L2 ([0, 1], R2n ) given by â(t) = a for all t ∈ [0, 1], we can identify Ker(Λ)
with E1 . We write Ker(Λ) = E1 without occurring of confusions. Denote by R(Λ) the range
of Λ. The following proposition is a standard exercise in functional analysis. But we still give
its proof for the sake of completeness.
Proposition 2.1. (i) R(Λ) is closed in L2 ([0, 1], R2n ) and there exists the following orthogonal decomposition of L2 :
L2 ([0, 1]) = Ker(Λ) ⊕ R(Λ).

(2.2)

(ii) The restriction Λ0 := Λ|R(Λ)∩dom(Λ) is a bijection onto R(Λ), and Λ−1
0 : R(Λ) → R(Λ)
is a compact and self-adjoint operator if R(Λ) is equipped with the L2 norm.
Proof. Step 1. R(Λ) is closed in L2 ([0, 1]). Let E1⊥ be the orthogonal complement of E1
with respect to the standard Euclidean inner product in R2n . Since dim E1 = 2n if and only
if Ψ = I2n , the problem reduces to the periodic case studied in past if dim E1⊥ = 0. Hence we
only consider the non-periodic case in which dim E1⊥ ≥ 1. Then
Ψ − I2n : E1⊥ → (Ψ − I2n )(R2n )

25

is continuously invertible. Denote by (Ψ − I)−1 its inverse and
C := sup{|(Ψ − I2n )−1 x | x ∈ (Ψ − I2n )(R2n ) & |x| = 1},

(2.3)

where | · | denotes the standard norm in R2n .
Let (xk ) ⊂ R(Λ) be a sequence converging to x in L2 ([0, 1], R2n ). For each xk , we may
choose its preimage to be
Z
t

xk (s)ds + uk (0),

uk (t) = J

0

where uk (0) ∈ E1⊥ . Then (uk ) is a Cauchy sequence in X. In fact, since uk (1) = Ψuk (0), we
R1
get J 0 xk (s)ds = (Ψ − I)uk (0), where uk (0) ∈ E1⊥ . Hence

|uk (0) − um (0)| ≤ C

p
kuk − um kH 1 ≤ 2C 2 + 3kxk − xm kL2 → 0

as k → ∞ and m → ∞.
Let uk → u in X. Then xk = Λuk → Λu in L2 ([0, 1], R2n ), and so Λu = x.
Step 2. L2 ([0, 1], R2n ) has the orthogonal decomposition as in (2.2). Note that R2n has the
following orthogonal splitting:
R2n = JKer(Ψ − I) ⊕ R(Ψ − I).

(2.4)

In fact, for a ∈ Ker(Ψ − I) and b = (Ψ − I)c ∈ R(Ψ − I), we have
hJa, bi =
=

hJa, (Ψ − I)ci = hJΨa, Ψci − hJa, ci

hΨt JΨa, ci − hJa, ci = hJa, ci − hJa, ci = 0.

This and the dimension equality dim Ker(Ψ − I) + dim R(Ψ − I) = dim R2n lead to (2.4).
For any given x ∈ L2 ([0, 1]), by (2.4) we can write
J

Z

x(s)ds = Ja + b,

where a ∈ Ker(Ψ − I) and b = (Ψ − I)c ∈ R(Ψ − I). Let

x(s)ds − Ja + c = Ψc = Ψu(0).

It follows from this and the definition of u that Λu = x − a.

26

Moreover, for a ∈ Ker(Λ) = Ker(Ψ − I) = E1 and y = Λw ∈ R(Λ), we compute

hΨt JΨa, w(0)i − hJa, w(0)i = 0.

Therefore the orthogonal decomposition in (2.2) follows immediately.
Step 3. Prove (ii). Firstly, we prove that R(Λ) ∩ dom(Λ) is a closed subspace in X (with
respect to the H 1 norm). Let (uk ) ⊂ R(Λ) ∩ dom(Λ) be a Cauchy sequence in H 1 norm. Then
it converges to some u ∈ X = dom(Λ) in the H 1 norm. Especially, (uk ) converges to u in the
L2 norm. Since R(Λ) is closed in L2 ([0, 1], R2n ) we get that u ∈ R(Λ). The claim is proved.
Consider the operator Λ0 := Λ|R(Λ)∩dom(Λ) . Clearly, it is a bijective continuous linear
map from a Hilbert subspace dom(Λ0 ) of X to the Hilbert subspace R(Λ) of L2 ([0, 1], R2n ).
Hence the Banach inverse operator theorem yield a continuous linear operator Λ−1
0 : R(Λ) →
dom(Λ0 ). Note that i : dom(Λ0 ) ֒→֒→ R(Λ) ( as a restriction of the compact inclusion map
H 1 ֒→ L2 ) is compact. Hence i ◦ Λ−1
0 : R(Λ) → R(Λ) is compact.
We claim that i ◦ Λ−1
is
also
self-adjoint.
In fact, for any u, w ∈ X there holds

0 x, yi = hu, ΛwiL2 = hΛu, wiL2 = hx, i ◦ Λ0 yiL2 .

Hence we have proved that i ◦ Λ−1
0 : R(Λ) → R(Λ) is a compact self-adjoint operator.
Since R(Λ) is a Hilbert subspace of L2 ([0, 1], R2n ) which is separable, by the standard linear
functional analysis theory, there exists an orthogonal basis of R(Λ) which completely consists
−1
of eigenvectors of i ◦ Λ−1
0 . Note that Ker(i ◦ Λ0 ) = 0 and that l 6= 0 is an eigenvalue of i ◦ Λ0
if and only if 1/l is an eigenvalue of Λ with the same multiplicity. Let
· · · ≤ λ−k ≤ λ−1 < 0 < λ1 ≤ · · · ≤ λk ≤ · · ·

(2.5)

denote all eigenvalues of Λ, which satisfy λk → ±∞ as k → ±∞. By these and (2.2), we get
a unit orthogonal basis of L2 ([0, 1], R2n ),
{ej | ± j ∈ N} ∪ {ei0 }qi=1 ,

(2.6)

such that Ker(Λ) = Span({ei0 }qi=1 ) and that each ej is an eigenvector corresponding to λj ,
j = ±1, ±2, · · · .
Proposition 2.2. ej and ei0 in (2.6) can be chosen to satisfy |ej (t)| = |ei0 (t)| ≡ 1 ∀t.

27

Proof. Let λ be an eigenvalue of Λ and let e ∈ X be an eigenvector associated with it.
Then −J ė(t) = λe(t) ∀t ∈ [0, 1] and e(1) = Ψe(0). It follows that e(t) = eλtJ e(0) and
e(1) = eλJ e(0) = Ψe(0), where e(0) ∈ R2n \ {0}. Hence det(eλJ − Ψ) = 0. By Lemma A.1
there are only finite real numbers t ∈ (0, 2π] such that det(etJ − Ψ) = 0. Denote them by
t1 < · · · < tm . Then all the eigenvalues of Λ are
{tl + 2kπ | 1 ≤ l ≤ m, k ∈ Z},

(2.7)

which are also all zeros of the function g in (1.13). Note that each eigenvector of tl + 2kπ has
the form
e(t) = e(tl +2kπ)tJ X,
(2.8)
where X ∈ Ker(etl J − Ψ). Letting |X| = 1, we get that |e(t)| ≡ 1.
Furthermore, if Ψ ∈ Sp(2n, R) ∩ O(2n) is as in (1.36), by Lemma A.3 the eigenvalues of Λ
associated to Ψ are
{θj + 2kπ | 1 ≤ j ≤ n, k ∈ Z},
where 0 < θ1 ≤ · · · ≤ θn ≤ 2π are as in (1.37), and the corresponding eigensubspace to θj +2kπ
is generated by
e(θj +2kπ)tJ Xj and e(θj +2kπ)tJ Yj
where Xj and Yj are given by (A.1).
Now we are in position to define the variational space needed in this article. Using the unit
orthogonal basis of L2 ([0, 1], R2n ) given by (2.6) every x ∈ L2 ([0, 1]) can be uniquely written
as
X

where x ∈ Ker(Λ) and {xk | ± k ∈ N} ∈ R. By Proposition 2.2 we can always assume

the series of functions x0 + k6=0 xk ek (t) is absolutely uniformly convergent. In other words,

x(t) is the uniform limit of the function sequence fk (t) := x0 + 0<|j|<k xj ej (t). It follows
that x is continuous and x(1) = Ψx(0) since fk (1) = Ψfk (0) for all k. Moreover, (2.12) is a

Clearly b̂ is differentiable. In fact, we start from the identity

Since (H2) implies that for |z| sufficiently large there holds
∇H(z) = 2az + z0

and Hzz = 2aI2n ,

it follows that there exist positive numbers C1 and C2 such that
and |Hzz | ≤ C2 ∀z ∈ R2n .

|∇H(z)| ≤ 2a|z| + C1

(2.18)

From the second inequality in (2.18) we derive that the last term of (2.17) is less than or equal
to C2 |ξ|2 and from the first inequality we get that ∇H(x) ∈ L2 for any x ∈ L2 . Therefore, for

Let j : E → L2 be the inclusion map, and j ∗ : L2 → E the adjoint operator of it. Define
b : E → R, x 7→ b̂(j(x)).
Then we have hj(x), yiL2 = hx, j ∗ (y)iE for all x ∈ E and y ∈ L2 .
Proposition 2.6. For y ∈ L2 , j ∗ (y) ∈ E 1 . Hence j ∗ is a compact operator.

Proof. For x ∈ E 2 and y ∈ L2 , write in the L2 space

Thus y 0 = ỹ 0 and yk = |λk |ỹk for k 6= 0. Since y ∈ L2 , we get that j ∗ (y) ∈ E 1 . Moreover, by
Proposition 2.3 I : E 1 → E is compact. Hence j ∗ is also compact.
For x and h ∈ E, a direct computation yields

db(x)[h] = d(b̂ ◦ j)(x)[h]

hj ∗ (∇H(j(x))), hiE .

Hence ∇b(x) = j ∗ ∇H(x) for x ∈ E.
Proposition 2.7. The gradient ∇b : E → E is compact and satisfies global Lipschitz condition
k∇b(x) − ∇b(y)kE ≤ C3 kx − ykE , ∀x, y ∈ E.
for some constant C3 > 0. Moreover, there exist positive numbers C4 and C5 such that
|b(x)| ≤ C4 kxk2L2 + C5 , ∀x ∈ E.
Proof. Since H satisfies (H2) in Section 1.2, there exist positive numbers C4 and C5 such that
|H(z)| ≤ C4 |z|2 + C5 , ∀z ∈ R2n .
Then the estimation for b(x) follows. Moreover, by the second inequality in (2.18), we have
k∇H(x) − ∇H(y)kL2 ≤ C2 kx − ykL2 , ∀x, y ∈ L2 .
Due to Proposition 2.6, we get that ∇b is compact and globally Lipschitz.
Proposition 2.7 shows that the functional ΦH = a − b in (1.15) is differentiable and ∇ΦH
satisfies global Lipschitz condition. Hence the negative gradient flow of ΦH defined by
dφt (x)
= −∇ΦH (φt (x))
dt
exists for all t ∈ R and x ∈ E.

31

and φ0 (x) = x

Proposition 2.8. The flow of ẋ = −∇ΦH (x) admits the representation
x · t = et x− + x0 + e−t x+ + K(t, x),
where K : R × E → E is continuous and maps bounded sets into precompact sets.
Proof. Define K by
K(t, x) =

Z

(et−s P − + P 0 + e−t+s P + )∇b(x · s)ds.

Let y(t) = et x− + x0 + e−t x+ + K(t, x). Then
ẏ(t) = ((P − − P + )y)(t) + ∇b(x · t).
On the other hand,

dx · t
= (P − − P + )x · t + ∇b(x · t).
dt

Therefore we have
d
(y(t) − x · t) = (P − − P + )(y(t) − x · t) and y(0) = x · 0 = x.

Hence we get that y(t) ≡ x · t. Note that

Since j ∗ is compact, K : R × E → E is compact.
Next we study the regularity of the critical points of ΦH .
Proposition 2.9. If x ∈ E is a critical point of ΦH , then x is smooth and satisfies
ẋ = J∇H(x)

and

x(1) = Ψx(0).

Proof. Let x ∈ E be a critical point of ΦH . Then
x+ − x− = j ∗ (∇H(x)).

(2.20)

It follows that x ∈ E 1 , where E 1 is as in (2.9). Using Proposition 2.4, x is continuous and
satisfies x(1) = Ψx(0). Hence ∇H(x) is also continuous. Using (2.4), write

d = 0 and λk ξk = bk ∀k 6= 0.

(2.23)

Since ξ and x are continuous, the second equalities in (2.20) and (2.23) leads to ξ(t) − x(t) =
const, i.e., ξ(t) − x(t) = ξ(0) − x(0) = c − x(0). Hence

Therefore x ∈ C 1 [0, 1] and satisfies ẋ = J∇H(x), which implies that x is smooth.
Proposition 2.10. If H ∈ C ∞ (R2n , R) is Ψ-nonresonant, then each sequence (xk ) ⊂ E with
∇ΦH (xk ) → 0 has a convergent subsequence. In particular, ΦH satisfies the (PS) condition.
Proof. Since ∇ΦH (x) = x+ − x− − ∇b(x) for any x ∈ E, we have

x+
k − xk − ∇b(xk ) → 0.

(2.24)

Case 1. (xk ) is bounded in E. Then (x0k ) is a bounded sequence in the space Ker(Λ) which
is of finite dimension. Hence (x0k ) has a convergent subsequence. Moreover, since ∇b is
−
compact, (∇b(xk )) has a convergent subsequence, and so both (x+
k ) and (xk ) have convergent
subsequences in E. Hence (xk ) has a convergent subsequence.
Case 2. (xk ) is unbounded in E. Without loss of generality, we may assume

The variational explanation for cΨ
EH

Our arguments are closely related to Sikorav’s approach in [50]. The main result is
Theorem 3.1. If H ∈ C ∞ (R2n , R) satisfies (H1)-(H2), and is also Ψ-nonresonant, then
cΨ
EH (H) is a positive critical value of ΦH .
The proof will be completed by serval propositions.
Proposition 3.2. (i) For any γ ∈ Γ and γ̃ ∈ Γ, then there holds γ ◦ γ̃ ∈ Γ.

(ii) Denote by S + the unit sphere in E + . For any e ∈ E + \ {0} and γ ∈ Γ, there holds
γ(S + ) ∩ (E − ⊕ E 0 ⊕ R+ e) 6= ∅.

(3.1)

Proof. (i) is direct from the definition. To prove (ii), let B + be the unit ball in E + . Since
a(x, u) > 0 for all x ∈ E and u ∈ [0, 1] (by Definition 1.4), we can define a homotopy
B + × [0, 1] ∋ (x, u) → Ψu (x) ∈ E + by
Ψu (x) = γu (x)+ /a(x, u),
Ψu (λx) = λΨu (x),

for x ∈ S + ,

for x ∈ S + and 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1.

Clearly, for x ∈ S + , 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ u ≤ 1 we have
Ψu (λx) − λx

34

Hence Ψu − id : B + → E + maps bounded sets to precompact sets by properties of γu .
Moreover, Ψu (x) 6= 0, ∀x ∈ S + . From the homotopy invariance of degree it follows that
deg(Ψ1 , 0, B + ) = deg(Ψ0 , 0, B + ). We claim that Ψ0 |B + = id. In fact, since γ0 = id, for any
x ∈ E + we have
γ0 (x) = a(x, 0)x + K(x, 0) = x.
Therefore
K(x, 0) = x − a(x, 0)x,

∀ x ∈ E+.

Since K : E × [0, 1] → (0, +∞) × E is compact, we get that K(·, 0) : E + → E + is compact.
Note that dim E + = ∞. These imply that a(x, 0) = 1 and K(x, 0) = 0 for all x ∈ E + . Hence
we get that
deg(Ψ1 , 0, B + ) = deg(id, 0, B + ) = 1.
By the property of omitted rays for the Leray-Schauder degree, for any e ∈ E + \ {0} there
exists x ∈ ∂B + = S + and λ ≥ 0 such that
1
γ1 (x)+ = Ψ1 (x) = λe.
a(x, 1)
Hence γ1 (x) = γ(x) ∈ E − ⊕ E 0 ⊕ R+ e and (3.1) is proved.

Let yj = kxjjkE and hence kyj kE = 1. By Proposition 2.3, (yj ) has a convergent subsequence

of (yj ), still denoted by (yj ), such that yj (t) → y(t) a.e. on (0, 1) and that |yj (t)| ≤ w(t)
a.e. on (0, 1) and for each j. Recall that we have assumed that H vanishes near z0 . By (H2)
and the Taylor expansion of H at z0 ∈ R2n , we have constants C1 > 0 and C2 > 0 such that
H(z0 + z) ≤ C1 |z|2 and H(z0 + z) ≤ C2 |z|3 for all z ∈ R2n . It follows that

Propositions 3.4, 3.5 show that cΨ
EH (H) is a finite positive number for each H ∈ C (R , R+ )

Proof of Theorem 3.1.

Let us define

u
Then cΨ
EH (H) = supF ∈F inf x∈F ΦH (x) since cEH (H) > 0. Note that the flow φ of ∇ΦH has
the form

φu (x) = e−u x− + x0 + eu x+ + K(u,

e : R × E → E is compact. For a set F = γ(S + ) ∈ F where γ ∈ Γ, α :=
where K
inf(ΦH |γ(S + )) > 0 by definition of F . Let ρ : R → [0, 1] be a smooth function such that
ρ(s) = 0 for s ≤ 0 and ρ(s) = 1 for s ≥ α. Define a vector field V on E by
V (x) = x+ − x− − ρ(ΦH (x))∇b(x).

Clearly V is locally Lipschitz and has linear growth so that V has a unique global flow which we
will denote by γ u . Moreover, it is obvious that γ u has the same property as φu described above.
For x ∈ E − ⊕ E 0 , we have ΦH (x) ≤ 0 and hence V (x) = −x− so that γ u (E − ⊕ E 0 ) = E − ⊕ E 0
and γ u (E \ E − ⊕ E 0 ) = E \ E − ⊕ E 0 , since γ u is a homeomorphism for each u ∈ R. Therefore,
γu ∈ Γ for all u ∈ R.

Proof of Theorem 1.8

By the assumption D contains a fixed point p of Ψ. Consider the symplectomorphism
φ : (R2n , ω0 ) → (R2n , ω0 ), x 7→ x − p.

(4.1)

Ψ
Since Ψ(p) = p implies φ ◦ Ψ = Ψ ◦ φ, we have cΨ
HZ (D, ω0 ) = cHZ (φ(D), ω0 ). Moreover,
for a (generalized) Ψ-characteristic z : [0, T ] → ∂D, it is easily checked that y = φ ◦ z is a
(generalized) Ψ-characteristic on ∂(φ(D)) = φ(∂D) and satisfies

y(T ) = φ(z(T )) = φ ◦ Ψ(z(0)) = Ψ ◦ φ(z(0)) = Ψ(y(0)) and A(y) = A(z).
Hence from now on we may assume p = 0, i.e. 0 ∈ int(D) in this section.
Lemma 4.1. Let D ⊂ R2n be a compact convex domain with boundary S = ∂D and with
0 ∈ int(D). If S is of class C 2n+2 , then the set
ΣΨ
S := {A(x) | A(x) > 0 and x is a Ψ-characteristic on S}
has no interior point in R.
This will be proved in Section 4.2.
Lemma 4.2. Let D ⊂ R2n be a compact convex domain with boundary S = ∂D and with
0 ∈ int(D). Then every generalized Ψ-characteristic on S, z : [0, T ] → R2n (for some T > 0),
may be reparameterized as a W 1,∞ -map z ∗ : [0, T ′ ] → R2n satisfying the boundary value
problem

where H = (jD )2 is the square of the Minkowski functional jD of D. (Precisely, there is
a differentiable homeomorphism ϕ : [0, T ′] → [0, T ] with an absolutely continuous inverse
ψ : [0, T ] → [0, T ′] such that z ∗ = z ◦ ϕ is a W 1,∞ -map satisfying (4.2).) Moreover,

Proof. By Lemma 2 in [17, Chap.V,§1] (or its proof) we see that z may be reparameterized as
an absolutely continuous map z ∗ : [0, T ′ ] → R2n satisfying the boundary value problem (4.2).
Take r > 0 sufficiently small such that H(h) < 1 for all h ∈ B 2n (r). Since H is convex, for
any x ∈ S and h ∈ B 2n (r) there holds
H(x + h) − H(x) =

If x∗ ∈ ∂H(x) then hx∗ , hi ≤ H(x + h) − H(x) < 3 for all h ∈ B 2n (r). It follows that
x∗ ∈ B 2n (3/r). This shows that
∂H(x) ⊂ B 2n (3/r),

∀x ∈ S.

(4.3)

Now z ∗ satisfies z ∗ ([0, T ′ ]) ⊂ S and −J ż ∗ (t) ∈ ∂H(z ∗ (t)), a.e. on [0, T ′ ]. Hence
kż ∗ (t)k = k − J ż ∗ (t)k ≤ 3/r,

4.1

a.e. on

[0, T ′ ].

Proof of (1.21)

We shall complete the proof via the Clarke dual variational principle in [11] (see also [43, 31]
(smooth case) and [17, 5] (nonsmooth case) for detailed arguments). Let jD : R2n → R be the
Minkowski (or gauge) functional associated to D. Then the Hamiltonian function H : R2n → R
defined by H(z) = (jD (z))2 is convex (and so continuous by [47, Cor.10.1.1] or [35, Prop.2.31])
and S = ∂D = H −1 (1). It is also C 1,1 with uniformly Lipschitz constant if S is is C 1,1 in R2n .
Moreover, there exists some constant R1 ≥ 1 such that
|z|2
≤ H(z) ≤ R1 |z|2
R1

∀z ∈ R2n .

(4.4)

This implies that the Legendre transformation of H defined by
H ∗ (w) = max
(hw, ξi − H(ξ)),
2n
ξ∈R

where h·, ·i is the standard Euclidean inner product, is a convex function from R2n to R (and
thus continuous). From this and (4.4) it follows that there exists a constant R2 ≥ 1 such that
|z|2
≤ H ∗ (z) ≤ R2 |z|2
R2

∀z ∈ R2n .

(4.5)

Note that H ∗ is also C 1,1 in R2n with uniformly Lipschitz constant if if S is is C 1,1 and strictly
convex. (See [47, Cor.10.1.1].)
Denote by E1 ⊂ R2n the eigenvector space which belongs to eigenvalue 1 of Ψ. Let E1⊥
be the orthogonal complement of E1 with respect to the standard Euclidean inner product in

38

R2n . When dim E1⊥ = 0, the problem reduces to the periodic case studied in past. Hence we
only consider the non-periodic case in which dim E1⊥ ≥ 1. Let C be given by (2.3), i.e., the
norm of ((Ψ − I2n )|E1⊥ )−1 .
Consider the subspace of H 1 ([0, 1], R2n ),
F = {x ∈ H 1 ([0, 1], R2n ) | x(1) = Ψx(0) & x(0) ∈ E1⊥ },

Step 2. There exists u ∈ A such that I(u) = µ. Let (xn ) ⊂ A be a sequence satisfying

By (4.10), for some C2 > 0 we have

Hence (xn ) is a bounded sequence in H 1 ([0, 1], R2n ). After passing to a subsequence if necessary, we may assume that (xn ) converges weakly to some u in H 1 ([0, 1], R2n ). By Arzelá-Ascoli
theorem, there also exists û ∈ C 0 ([0, 1], R2n ) such that
lim

sup |xn (t) − û(t)| = 0.

n→+∞ t∈[0,1]

Then a standard argument gives that û(t) = u(t) almost everywhere. Since xn → u in
C 0 ([0, 1], R2n ), we get that u(1) = Ψu(0) and u(0) ∈ E1⊥ . Moreover, u ∈ A because

(xn ) converges weakly to some u in H 1 ([0, 1], R2n ) implies that (ẋn ) converges weakly to some
u̇ in L2 ([0, 1], R2n ), we deduce that the left hand of (4.11) converges to 0. Therefore
µ ≤ I(u) ≤ lim I(xn ) = µ.
n→+∞

The desired claim is proved.
Step 3. There exists a generalized Ψ-characteristic on S, x̂ : [0, µ] → S, such that A(x̂) = µ.
Since u is the minimum of I|A , applying Lagrangian multiplier theorem (cf. [13, Theorem 6.1.1]) we get some λ ∈ R such that 0 ∈ ∂(I + λA)(u) = ∂I(u) + λA′ (u). Let us
write ΛF as the operator Λ in (2.1) viewed as an operator from Hilbert space F equipped
with W 1,2 norm to Hilbert space L2 . It is a closed linear operator. Using I = Iˆ ◦ ΛF and
Corollary 6 in [17, Chap.II,§2] we arrive at

∂I(u) = (ΛF )∗ ∂ I(Λ

= {(ΛF )∗ w | w ∈ L2 ([0, 1], R2n ) & w(t) ∈ ∂H ∗ (−J u̇(t)) a.e. on [0, 1]}.

Hence there exists a function w ∈ L2 ([0, 1], R2n ) with w(t) ∈ ∂H ∗ (−J u̇(t)) a.e. on [0, 1] such
that (ΛF )∗ w + λA′ (u) = 0, i.e.,

∂H(a0 + µu(t)) a.e. on [0,1]. Define v : [0, µ] → R2n by
v(t) := µu(t/µ) + a0 .

of H imply −J ẋ∗ (t) ∈ ∂H(x∗ (t)) a.e. on [0, µ]. The following claim shows that x∗ satisfies
(1.21).
Step 4.
For any generalized Ψ-characteristic on S with positive action, y : [0, T ] → S,
there holds A(y) ≥ µ.
By Lemma 4.2, by reparameterizing it we may assume that y ∈
W 1,2 ([0, T ], R2n ) and satisfies (4.2) with T ′ being replaced by T . Then
A(y) = T

and H(y(t)) ≡ 1

(4.18)

by [37, Theorem 2]). Choose a ∈ R and b ∈ E1 so that
y ∗ : [0, 1] → R2n , t 7→ y ∗ (t) = ay(tT ) + b
belongs to A. Then 1 = A(y ∗ ) = a2 A(y) = a2 T . Since
−J ẏ ∗ (t) = −aT J ẏ(tT ) ∈ aT ∂H(y(T t)) = ∂H(aT y(T t)) a.e. on

[0, 1],

there holds aT y(T t) ∈ ∂H ∗ (−J ẏ ∗ (t)) a.e. on [0, 1] and the legendre reciprocity formula (cf.
[17, Proposition II.1.15]) in convex analysis yields
H ∗ (−J ẏ ∗ (t))

= −H(aT y(T t)) + h−J ẏ ∗ (t), aT y(T t)i

= −(aT )2 H(y(t)) + h−aT J ẏ(T t), aT y(T t)i

= −(aT )2 + (aT )2 h−J ẏ(T t), y(T t)i

= −(aT )2 + 2(aT )2 H(y(T t)) = (aT )2 = T,

a.e. on [0, 1],

where the fourth equality comes from the Euler formula [57, Theorem 3.1]. Hence H ∗ (−J ẏ ∗ (t)) =
T a.e. on [0, 1] so that

H ∗ (−J ẏ ∗ (t))dt = T.

The definition of µ implies T ≥ µ and it follows that A(y) ≥ µ by (4.18).
Remark 4.3. From the above proof we see that u given by Step 2 satisfies
min{A(x) > 0 | x is a generalized Ψ-characteristic on S}

= A(x∗ )
= I(u)

= min{I(x) | x ∈ F & A(x) = 1}.

(4.19)

As in the periodic case we have
−1

min{I(x) | x ∈ F & A(x) = 1} = (max{A(x) | x ∈ F & I(x) = 1})
In fact, since µ := min{I(x) | x ∈ F & A(x) = 1} > 0, we have
µ = min{I(x) > 0 | x ∈ F & A(x) = 1}.

42

(4.20)

Note that I(u) = µ and A(u) = 1. Then I(u/ µ) = 1 and so
√
sup{A(x) | x ∈ F & I(x) = 1} ≥ A((u/ µ)) = 1/µ.
This also shows
sup{A(x) | x ∈ F & I(x) = 1} = sup{A(x) > 0 | x ∈ F & I(x) = 1}.
√
Let x√ ∈ F be such that I(x) = 1 and b = A(x) > 0. Then A(x/ b) = 1 and so 1/b =
I(x/ b) ≥ µ. That is, b ≤ 1/µ. Hence sup{A(x) | x ∈ F & I(x) = 1} ≤ 1/µ.

4.2

Proof of Lemma 4.1

As Hofer and Zehnder done in [31, pages 153-154] the proof will be completed with an idea due
to Sikorav [50]. However, we shall use new techniques to avoid the arguments of smoothness
for the action functional as given in [31, Appendix 3].
Fix 1 < α < 2. Since S is of class C 2n+2 , the Minkowski functional jD : R2n → R is C 2n+2
in R2n \ {0} so that the C 1 Hamiltonian function
F : R2n → R, z 7→ (jD (z))α
is also C 2n+2 in R2n \ {0}. To clarify the elements in the set ΣΨ
S , we only need to consider the
action of Ψ-characteristic x : [0, T ∗] → S that satisfies
ẋ = J∇F (x)

and x(T ∗ ) = Ψx(0).

(4.21)

Clearly such a Ψ-characteristic x has the action
A(x) = αT ∗ /2.

(4.22)

Ψ
We only need to prove for an arbitrarily fixed σ = αT ∗ /2 ∈ ΣΨ
S that ΣS ∩ (σ − ǫ, σ + ǫ)
has no interior point for some sufficiently small positive number ǫ. To this end, let us choose
0 < ε1 < ε2 such that B 2n (ε1 ) B 2n (ε2 ) D and

so that F ∈ C 2n+2 (R2n , R). If x ∈ C 1 ([0, T ], R2n ) satisfies

Now ψ(·, z) : [0, 1] → R2n sits in CΨ
and applying Corollary B.2 to the C 2n+1 map

[0, 1] × B̄ 2n (0, R) ∋ (t, z) 7→ ψ(t, z) ∈ R2n
1
for any given R > 0 we deduce that B̄ 2n (0, R) ∋ z 7→ ψ(·, z) ∈ CΨ
is C 2n . So

Ω : R2n → CΨ
, z 7→ Ω(z) = ψ(·, z)

(4.25)

is C 2n . (It is not hard to prove this directly!) This and Claim 4.4 show that the composition
ΦF |CΨ1 ◦ Ω : R2n → R

(4.26)

is of class C 2n . Note that every critical point y of the functional ΦF |CΨ1 has the form y(t) =
φt (zy ) for some zy ∈ R2n satisfying φ1 (zy ) = Ψzy and thus y = Ω(zy ). Hence zy is a critical
point of ΦF |CΨ1 ◦ Ω. In particular, the critical values of ΦF |CΨ1 (and hence ΦF ) are contained
in the set of critical values of ΦF |CΨ1 ◦ Ω which is a nowhere dense set by Sard theorem.
Now since {ΦF (y) | y ∈ Crit(ΦF )} is a nowhere dense set, so is
1

{ΦF (y) | y(t) = T α−2 x(tT ) and x satisfies (4.23)}.

Proof of (1.22) for smooth and strictly convex D

The proof is similar to that of [30, Propposition 4]. For the sake of completeness we still give
its details.
Step 1. Prove
∗
cΨ
(4.27)
HZ (D, ω0 ) ≥ A(x ).
For small 0 < ǫ, δ < 1/2, pick a smooth function f : [0, 1] → R such that
f (t) = 0,
∗

f (t) = A(x ) − ε,
′

∗

0 ≤ f (t) < A(x ),

t ≤ δ,

1 − δ ≤ t,

δ < t < 1 − δ.

2
Define H(x) = f (jD
(x)) for x ∈ D. Then H ∈ HΨ (D, ω0 ). Let us prove that every solution
x : [0, T ] → D of the boundary value problem
2
2
ẋ = J∇H(x) = f ′ (jD
(x))J∇jD
(x)

45

and x(T ) = Ψx(0)

(4.28)

with 0 < T ≤ 1 is constant. By contradiction we assume that x = x(t) is a nonconstant
solution of it. Then jD (x(t)) is equal to a nonzero constant and thus x(t) 6= 0 for each t ∈ [0, T ].
2
2
2
Moreover, f ′ (jD
(x(t))) ≡ a ∈ (0, A(x∗ )). Since ∇jD
(λz) = λ∇jD
(z) for all (λ, z) ∈ R+ × R2n ,
multiplying x(t) by a suitable positive number we may assume that x([0, T ]) ⊂ S = ∂D and
2
ẋ = aJ∇jD
(x)

and x(T ) = Ψx(0).

(4.29)

2
2
Note that h∇jD
(z), zi = jD
(z) = 1 for any z ∈ S. We deduce from (4.29) that

0 < A(x) = aT ≤ a < A(x∗ ),
which contradicts (1.21).
∗
This shows that H ∈ HΨ (D, ω0 ) is admissible and hence cΨ
HZ (D, ω0 ) ≥ m(H) = A(x ) − ǫ.
Letting ǫ → 0 we get (4.27).
Step 2. Prove
∗
cΨ
(4.30)
HZ (D, ω0 ) ≤ A(x ).
Let H ∈ HΨ (D, ω0 ) satisfy m(H) > A(x∗ ). We wish to prove that the boundary value problem
ẋ = J∇H(x)

and x(1) = Ψx(0)

(4.31)

has a nonconstant solution x : [0, 1] → D. By Lemma 4.1 we have a small number ǫ > 0 such
∗
that A(x∗ ) + ǫ ∈
/ ΣΨ
S and m(H) > A(x ) + ǫ. This means that the boundary value problem
2
ẋ = (A(x∗ ) + ǫ)J∇jD
(x)

and x(1) = Ψx(0)

(4.32)

admits only the trivial solution x ≡ 0. (Otherwise, we have x(t) 6= 0 ∀t ∈ [0, 1] as above. Thus
after multiplying x(t) by a suitable positive number we may assume that x([0, 1]) ⊂ S = ∂D,
which leads to A(x) = A(x∗ ) + ǫ.) For a fixed number δ > 0 we take a smooth function
f : [1, ∞) → R such that
f (t) ≥ (A(x∗ ) + ǫ)t,

f (t) = (A(x∗ ) + ǫ)t,
f (t) = m(H),
′

∗

0 ≤ f (t) ≤ A(x ) + ǫ,

t ≥ 1,

t large,
1 ≤ t ≤ 1 + δ,
t > 1 + δ.

With this f we get an extension of H as follows

Lemma 4.5. Assume that x is a solution of ẋ(t) = XH (x(t)) satisfying x(1) = Ψx(0) and
ΦH (x) > 0. Then it is nonconstant, sits in D completely, and thus is a solution of ẋ = XH (x)
on D.
Proof. Since H ≥ 0 and ΦH (x) > 0, x cannot be constant. By contradiction, suppose that
x(t̄) ∈
/ D for some t̄. Then x(t) ∈
/ D for all t. By the construction of H, the Hamiltonian
equation ẋ = XH (x) becomes

Lemma 4.6. If a sequence (xk ) ⊂ E such that ∇ΦH (xk ) → 0 in E, then it has a convergent
subsequence in E.
Proof. If (xk ) is bounded in E, as in the proof of Proposition 2.10 we deduce that (xk ) has a
convergent subsequence. Without loss of generality, we assume limk→+∞ kxk kE = +∞. Let
yk = kxxkkkE . Then kyk kE = 1 and satisfies

(4.34)

By the construction of H and the proof of Proposition 2.10, passing to a subsequence (if
necessary) we may assume that yk → y in E so that kykE = 1. Since H(z) = Q(z) :=
2
(A(x∗ ) + ǫ)jD
(z) when |z| is sufficiently large, arguing as in the proof of Proposition 2.10 we
get
∇H(xk )

kxk kE
L2
so that (4.34) becomes
y + − y − − j ∗ ∇Q(y) = 0.
Hence y satisfies the boundary value problem (4.32) and thus y = 0 because A(x∗ ) + ǫ ∈
/ ΣΨ
S.
This contradicts to the fact kykE = 1. That is, (xk ) must be bounded in E.
By arguments in Section 4.1 x∗ in (1.21) can be chosen as in (4.17). Then define x0 (t) =

Lemma 4.8. ΦH |∂Στ ≤ 0 if τ > 0 is sufficiently large.
Arguing as in the proof of Proposition 3.5, we get
Lemma 4.9. For z0 ∈ Fix(Ψ) ∩ H −1 (0), there exist constants α > 0 and β > 0 such that
ΦH |Γα ≥ β > 0,
where Γα = {z0 + x | x ∈ E + & kxkE = α}.
Let φt be the negative gradient flow of ΦH . Arguing as in Section 2, φt has the property
described in Proposition 2.8.
Lemma 4.10. φt (Στ ) ∩ Γα 6= ∅, ∀t ≥ 0.
Proof. Observe that φt (Στ ) ∩ Γα 6= ∅ if and only if x · t ∈ Γα for some x ∈ Στ , that is,

 x ∈ Στ
(P − + P 0 )(x · t − z0 ) = 0,

kx · t − z0 kE = α.

By Proposition 2.8

(4.37)

(P − + P 0 )(x · t − z0 ) = et x− + P − K(t, x) + x0 + P 0 K(t, x) − z0 .
Hence (4.37) is equivalent to

 x ∈ Στ
x− + e−t P − K(t, x) + x0 + P 0 K(t, x) − z0 = 0,

(kx · t − z0 kE − α)x+
0 = 0.

Define B(t, ·) : E − ⊕ E 0 ⊕ Rx+

+
B(t, x) = e−t P − K(t, x) + P 0 K(t, x) − z0 + (kx · t − z0 kE − α)x+
0 − P x.

Then (4.37) is equivalent to



x ∈ Στ
x + B(t, x) = 0.

(4.38)

Since K in Proposition 2.8 is precompact, so is B(t, ·). Note that for the constant α in Lemma
4.9 we have
0∈
/ (id + B(t, ·))(∂Στ ), ∀t ≥ 0
if τ in Lemma 4.8 is sufficiently large. From now on, we fix a sufficiently large τ > α. Then
deg(Στ , id + B(t, ·), 0) = deg(Στ , id + B(0, ·), 0). Since K(0, x) = 0, we have
B(0, x) = −z0 + P + {(kx − z0 kE − α)x+
0 − x}.
Define the homotopy
Lµ (x) = −z0 + P + {(µkx − z0 kE − α)x+
0 − µx}

48

for 0 ≤ µ ≤ 1.

Since Lµ maps E − ⊕ E + ⊕ Rx+
0 into a finite dimensional space, Lµ is precompact for every
0 ≤ µ ≤ 1. We conclude that x + Lµ (x) 6= 0 for x ∈ ∂Στ and 0 ≤ µ ≤ 1. Otherwise, suppose
that x + Lµ x = 0 for some µ ∈ [0, 1] and some x = x− + x0 + sx+
0 ∈ ∂Στ . Then
− z0 + P + {(µkx − z0 kE − α)x+
0 − µx} = −x.

(4.39)

It follows that x− = 0 and x0 = z0 . (Note that τ can be chosen so large that τ > |z0 |). Thus
+
+
+
(4.39) becomes (µskx+
0 kE − α)x0 − µsx0 = −sx0 , that is,
µskx+
0 kE − α = µs − s.

(4.40)

Moreover, by (4.36) we have either s = 0 or s = τ . Because α > 0, (4.40) implies s 6= 0. Hence
we get µτ kx+
0 kE − α = µτ − τ , i.e.,
τ=

α

min{kx+

µkx+

+
because 0 < min{kx+
0 kE , 1} ≤ µkx0 kE + 1 − µ ≤ 1 for 0 ≤ µ ≤ 1. Thus as sufficiently large τ
+
satisfies τ > α/ min{1, kx0 kE }, we get a contradiction.
It follows from the homotopy invariance of degree that

deg(Στ , id + B(t, ·), 0)

= deg(Στ , id + B(0, ·), 0)
= deg(Στ , id + L0 , 0)

= deg(Στ , id − z0 − αx+
0 , 0) = 1.
This implies that (4.38) and so (4.37) has solutions.
Let F = {φt (Στ )|t ≥ 0} and define
c(ΦH , F ) := inf

sup

ΦH (x).

ΦH (x) ∀t ≥ 0,

t≥0 x∈φt (Στ )

Lemmas 4.9, 4.10 imply

x∈φt (Στ )

and hence c(ΦH , F ) ≥ β > 0. On the other hand, since Στ is bounded and Proposition 2.7
implies that ΦH maps bounded sets into bounded sets we arrive at
c(ΦH , F ) ≤ sup ΦH (x) < ∞.
x∈Στ

Using the Minimax Lemma on [31, page 79], we get a critical point x of ΦH with ΦH (x) > 0.
Now Lemma 4.5 and Proposition 2.9 together yield the proof of Theorem 1.8.

Denote by w∗ the projections of w onto E ∗ (according to the decomposition E = E 1/2 =

Lemma 5.2. For H ∈ Eǫ (R2n , D), ΦH satisfies the (P S) condition.
By the same method used in proving Theorem 3.1, we get
Corollary 5.3. For H ∈ Eǫ (R2n , D), cΨ
EH (H) is a positive critical value of ΦH .

−J ẋ(t) = ∇H(x(t)) = f ′ (H(x(t)))∇H(x(t)),

In summary, in two case we have ΦHτ (x) < a + ε.
Now we have proved (1.24) under the assumption (5.1). In order to remove the latter
assumption, as in Section 4.4 we may choose a sequence of C ∞ strictly convex domains, (Dk+ ),
such that
(i) the closure of D is contained in each Dk+ ,
+
(ii) D1+ ⊇ D2+ ⊇ · · · ⊇ D and ∩∞
k=1 Dk = D,

(iii) for any small neighborhood O of ∂D there exists an integer N > 0 such that ∂Dk+ ⊂
O ∀k ≥ N .

Then the above arguments and results hold for each Dk . Almost repeating the arguments in
Section 4.4 leads to the expected conclusions.
Finally, let us prove (1.25). Note that both ∂D and D contain fixed points of Ψ. As
above we can assume 0 ∈ D. Clearly, ∂D also contains fixed points of Ψ and so cΨ
EH (∂D) is
well-defined. Let

(see proof of Proposition 3.5 ). Let ϕu be the flow of ∇ΦHe . Put

(5.16)

Because ΦHe is nondecreasing along flow,

ΦHe |Su ≥ ΦHe |S0 > 0 ∀u ≥ 0.

Thus this, (5.15) and (5.16)-(5.17) show that γ satisfies (5.14).

Proof of Theorem 1.12. Step 1. Prove (1.29). By the approximation arguments as
above (5.10) we may assume that each Di ⊂ R2ni is a C 2 convex bounded domain containing
Ψi
i
a fixed point pi of Ψi , 1 ≤ i ≤ k. Since cΨ
EH (Di − pi ) = cEH (Di ), 1 ≤ i ≤ k, and
Ψ
cΨ
EH ((D1 − p1 ) × · · · × (Dk − pk )) = cEH (D1 × · · · × Dk ),

we may also assume that each Di contains the origin of R2ni , 1 ≤ i ≤ k. Thus it follows from
the monotonicity and Lemma 5.6 that

ΦHbi |γi (Bi+ \ (2k)−1 Bi+ ) ≥ cΨ
EH (Di ) − ǫ,

ΦHbi |γi (Bi+ ) ≥ 0.

Since for any x = (x1 , · · · , xk ) ∈ S + ⊂ B1+ × · · · × Bk+ there exists some i0 such that
xi0 ∈ Bi+0 \ (2k)−1 Bi+0 ,
putting γ = γ1 × · · · × γk we arrive at

(5.19)

and so (1.29) by combining with (5.18).
Step 2. Prove (1.30). As in Step 1, for each i = 1, · · · , k we may assume: (i) Di ⊂ R2ni is
compact, convex, and has C 2 -boundary, (ii) ∂Di contains a fixed point pi of Ψi and Int(Di )
e ∈ F (R2n , S) with S =

EH and (5.18) we obtain (1.30).

Proof of Theorem 1.17

The proof of [50, Th.7.5.1] is different from that of [20, Prop.6]. The former can be adapted
to complete the proof for Theorem 1.17 conveniently.
Let λ0 = 21 (qdp − pdq), where (q, p) is the standard coordinate on R2n . Then dλ0 =
dq ∧ dp = ω0 . For any Ψ-characteristics on S, x : [0, T ] → S, by (1.1) we have
Z
A(x) =
x∗ λ0 .
(6.1)
x

Since x is not closed, we can not replace λ0 by other primitives of ω0 in general.
Lemma 6.1. For the 1−form λ := ıX ω0 , where X is the Ψ-invariant Liouville vector field in
Theorem 1.17, there holds
Z
Z
x∗ λ0 = x∗ λ,
(6.2)
x

x

for all Ψ-characteristics on S.

Proof. In fact, let X0 (z) = 12 z, ∀z ∈ R2n . Then we have
λ0 = ıX0 ω0 ,

and X0 (Ψ(z)) = ΨX0 (z), ∀z ∈ R2n .

For a vector Y ∈ Tz R2n = R2n , we compute
Ψ∗ λ0 (z)[Y ] =
=

λ0 (Ψz)[ΨY ] = ω0 (X0 (Ψz), ΨY ) = ω0 (ΨX0 (z), ΨY )
Ψ∗ ω0 (X0 (z), Y ) = ω0 (X0 (z), Y ) = ıX0 ω0 (z)[Y ] = λ0 (z)[Y ].

Hence
Ψ∗ λ0 = λ0 .

(6.3)

Ψ∗ λ = λ.

(6.4)

The same arguments lead to
∞

2n

Since d(λ0 − λ) = 0, there exists F ∈ C (R , R) such that λ0 − λ = dF . By (6.3) and (6.4),
we have
Ψ∗ dF = Ψ∗ (λ0 − λ) = λ0 − λ = dF,
which implies that there exists a constant C such that
F (Ψ(z)) − F (z) = C, ∀z ∈ R2n .
Since F (Ψ(0)) − F (0) = 0, we get that C = 0. Therefore (6.2) follows from the boundary
condition x(1) = Ψx(0).
Ψ
Note that S ∩ Fix(Ψ) 6= ∅ implies that cΨ
EH (S) < ∞ and cEH (B) < ∞.
Using the local flow φt of the Liouville vector field X we may define a very special parameterized family of hypersurfaces modelled on S, given by

ψ : (−ε, ε) × S → R2n , (s, z) 7→ φs (z),

(6.5)

where ε > 0 is so small that R2n \ ∪t∈(−ε,ε) φt (S) has two components, and that
Ψ(φt (z)) = φt (Ψz), ∀(t, z) ∈ (−ε, ε) × S

(6.6)

because of (1.45). Define U := ∪t∈(−ε,ε) φt (S) and
Kψ : U → R, w 7→ τ

57

(6.7)

if w = ψ(τ, z) ∈ U where z ∈ S. Let XKψ be the Hamiltonian vector field associated to Kψ
defined by ω0 (·, XKψ ) = dKψ . Then for w = φτ (z) = ψ(τ, z) ∈ U it holds that
λw (XKψ ) =

(6.8)

Moreover, we have also
XKψ (ψ(τ, z)) = e−τ dφτ (z)[XKψ (z)] ∀(τ, z) ∈ (−ε, ε) × S.

(6.9)

Clearly (6.6) and (6.9) show that y : [0, T ] → Sτ = φτ (S) satisfies ẏ(t) = XKψ (y(t)) and
y(T ) = Ψy(0) if and only if y(t) = ψ(τ, x(e−τ t)), where x : [0, e−τ T ] → S satisfies ẋ(t) =
R
R
XKψ (x(t)) and x(e−τ T ) = Ψx(0); in addition y ∗ λ = eτ x∗ λ.
Proposition 6.2. Let S ⊂ (R2n , ω0 ) be as in Theorem 1.17. Then the interior of
ΣΨ
S = {A(x) > 0 | x is a Ψ-characteristic on S}
is empty.
Proof. Denote by ϕt the flow of XKψ By (6.1), (6.2) and (6.8), we only need to prove that
∆ := {T > 0 | ∃z ∈ S such that ϕT (z) = Ψz}
has empty interior. We assume that S is contained in a ball B 2n (0, R) below.
Fix 0 < δ < ε. Let Aδ and Bδ denote the unbounded and bounded components of
R2n \ ∪t∈(−δ,δ) φt (S), respectively. Then
ψ({τ } × S) ⊂ Bδ

for

− ε < τ < −δ.

Lemma 6.3. (i) If x is a nonconstant critical point of ΦH on E such that x(0) ∈ ψ({τ } × S)

S , then there is a nonconstant
critical point x of ΦH on E such that x(0) ∈ ψ({τ } × S).

58

Proof. (i) Since ẋ = XH (x) = f ′ (τ )XKψ (x), it is a Ψ-characteristic on ψ({τ } × S) and so
x(t) = ψ(τ, y(t)) = φτ (y(t)) for t ∈ [0, 1], where y is a Ψ-characteristic on S. It follows that

H(x(t))dt = f ′ (τ ) − f (τ ).

(ii) By the assumption there exists y : [0, 1] → S such that y(1) = Ψy(0) ∈ S and
ẏ = e−τ f ′ (τ )XKψ (y).
Hence x(t) = ψ(τ, y(t)) = φτ (y(t)) satisfies
ẋ(t)

=

dφτ (y(t))[ẏ(t)] = e−τ f ′ (τ )dφτ (y(t))[XKψ (y)]

=

f ′ (τ )XKψ (φτ (y(t))) = f ′ (τ )XKψ (x(t)) = XH (x(t)),

and
x(1) = Ψx(0) ∈ φτ (S),

that is, x is the desired critical point of ΦH . Moreover ΦH (x) = f ′ (τ ) − f (τ ).
Continuing the proof of Proposition 6.2. For a fixed T ∈ ΣΨ
S , we choose the above
function f such that
f (u) = T u + C

∀u ∈ [−ǫ1 , ǫ1 ]

(6.13)

for some 0 < ǫ1 < δ and C such that f (u) ≥ 0, ∀u ∈ [−ǫ1 , ǫ1 ]. Clearly O := {e−τ T | τ ∈
(−ε1 , ε1 )} is an open neighborhood of T . If O ∩ ΣΨ
S has an interior point, then

τ ∈ (−ε1 , ε1 ) | e−τ T ∈ ΣΨ
S ⊂ {τ ∈ (−ε1 , ε1 ) | T − f (τ ) is a critical value of AH }

has nonempty interior. It follows that the critical value set of AH has nonempty interior. This
is a contradiction. Hence ΣΨ
S has empty interior.

Continuing the proof of Theorem 1.17. For C > 0 large enough and δ > 2η > 0 small

Such a family HC,η (C → +∞, η → 0) can be chosen to be cofinal in the set F(R2n , S) defined
by (1.18) and also to have the property that
C ≤ C ′ ⇒ HC,η ≤ HC ′ ,η ,

Step 1. Prove cΨ
EH (S) ∈ ΣS .

Let us prove that this case does not occur. Note that (6.21) implies
Claim 6.4. If C < C ′ belong to (C̄, +∞) then
Υ(C) + C ≥ Υ(C ′ ) + C ′ .

(6.22)

Proof. Assume that for some C ′ > C > C,
Υ(C) + C < Υ(C ′ ) + C ′ .

(6.23)

We shall prove:
for any given d ∈ (Υ(C) + C, Υ(C ′ ) + C ′ )
there exist C0 ∈ (C, C ′ ) such that Υ(C0 ) + C0 = d.



(6.24)

This contradicts the facts that Int(ΣΨ
S ) = ∅ and (6.20) holds for all large C satisfying (6.18).
′′

Put ∆d = {C ∈ (C, C ) | C + Υ(C ′′ ) > d}. Since Υ(C ′ ) + C ′ > d and Υ(C ′ ) ≤ Υ(C ′′ ) ≤
Υ(C) for any C ′′ ∈ (C, C ′ ) we obtain Υ(C ′′ ) + C ′′ > d if C ′′ ∈ (C, C ′ ) is sufficiently close to
C ′ . Hence ∆d 6= ∅. Set C0 = inf ∆d . Then C0 ∈ [C, C ′ ).
Let (Cn′′ ) ⊂ ∆d satisfy Cn′′ ↓ C0 . Since Υ(Cn′′ ) ≤ Υ(C0 ), we have d < Cn′′ + Υ(Cn′′ ) ≤
Υ(C0 ) + Cn′′ for each n ∈ N, and thus d ≤ Υ(C0 ) + C0 by letting n → ∞.
Suppose that
d < Υ(C0 ) + C0 .
(6.25)

61

Since d > C +Υ(C), this implies C 6= C0 and so C0 > C. For Ĉ ∈ (C, C0 ), from Υ(Ĉ) ≥ Υ(C0 )
and (6.25) we derive that Υ(Ĉ) + Ĉ > d if Ĉ is close to C0 . Hence such Ĉ belongs to ∆d ,
which contradicts C0 = inf ∆d .
Hence (6.25) does not hold. That is, d = Υ(C0 ) + C0 . (6.24) is proved. Since (6.24)
′
contradicts the fact that ΣΨ
S has empty interior. Hence (6.22) does hold for all C < C < C .
Since Ξ := {C > C̄ | C satisfying (6.18)} is dense in (C̄, +∞), it follows from Claim 6.4
that Υ(C ′ ) + C ′ ≤ Υ(C) + C if C ′ > C are in Ξ. Fix a C ∗ ∈ Ξ. Then
Υ(C ′ ) + C ′ ≤ Υ(C ∗ ) + C ∗

∀C ′ ∈ {C ∈ Ξ | C > C ∗ }.

Taking a sequence (Cn′ ) ⊂ {C ∈ Ξ | C > C ∗ } such that Cn′ → +∞, we deduce that Υ(Cn′ ) →

EH (S) > 0. Hence (6.21) does not hold!

For HC,η in (6.14), we choose an associated ĤC,η , where fˆC,η |[0, ∞) = fC,η |[0, ∞) and
ĥC,η = hC,η . Consider Hs = sHC,η + (1 − s)ĤC,η , 0 ≤ s ≤ 1, and put

It suffices to prove cΨ
EH (H0 ) = cEH (H1 ). If x is a critical point of Φs with Φs (x) > 0. As
in Lemma 4.5 we have x([0, 1]) ∈ Sτ = ψ({τ } × S) for some τ ∈ (η, 2η). The choice of ĤC,η
shows Hs (x(t)) ≡ HC,η (x(t)) for t ∈ [0, 1]. This implies that each Φs has the same positive
critical value as ΦHC,η . By the continuity in Proposition 1.5(ii), s 7→ cΨ
EH (Hs ) is continuous

Proofs of Theorems 1.27, 1.29
Proof of Theorem 1.27

S
Step 1. Let U = λ∈I Sλ be a thickening of a compact and regular energy surface S = {x ∈
M | H(x) = 0} in a symplectic manifold (M, ω) as in (1.56). Corresponding to [31, p. 109,
Proposition 1] we have:
Claim 7.1. For a converging sequence λj → λ∗ in the interval I, suppose that for every λj
the Hamiltonian boundary value problem
ẋ = XH (x),

x(Tj ) = Ψx(0),

0 < Tj < ∞

has a solution xj : [0, Tj ] → Sλj . If Tj ≤ C for some constant C > 0 and for all j then Sλ∗
carries either a fixed point of Ψ or a Ψ-characteristic y : [0, T ] → Sλ∗ satisfying ẏ = XH (y)
and 0 < T ≤ C.
Indeed, for each j, the map zj : [0, 1] → Sλ∗ defined by zj (t) = xj (Tj t) satisfies żj (t) =
Tj XH (zj (t)) and Ψzj (0) = zj (1). By means of the Arzela-Ascoli theorem, passing to a subsequence we may assume that Tj → T and zj → z in C ∞ ([0, 1], M ). Hence z(1) = Ψz(0) and
ż(t) = T XH (z(t) for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1. Clearly, 0 ≤ T ≤ C. If T = 0 then z is constant and therefore
z(0) ∈ Sλ∗ is a fixed point of Ψ. If T > 0 then y : [0, T ] → Sλ∗ defined by y(t) := z(t/T ) is
the desired Ψ-characteristic.
Step 2. Along the ideas in [41], for each n ∈ N let Gn be the set of nonzero parameters λ ∈
I = (−ε, ε) for which Sλ contains either a fixed point of Ψ or a Ψ-characteristic y : [0, T ] → Sλ
satisfying
0 < T ≤ n, ẏ = XH (y) if λ > 0, ẏ = −XH (y) if λ < 0.
The above claim implies that Gn is closed and therefore that G = ∪∞
n=1 Gn is a Lebesguemeasurable set. For 0 < δ < ε we define
[
Sλ = {x ∈ U | − δ < H(x) < δ},
Uδ :=
|λ|<δ

which is an open subset in U . Since S0 = S has nonempty intersection with Fix(Ψ), so
Uδ ∩ Fix(Ψ) 6= ∅. It follows that cΨ
HZ (Uδ , ω) is well-defined and Proposition 1.2(ii) implies that

HZ (Uδ , ω) ≤ cHZ (Uδ ∗ , ω) + L(δ − δ ),

In fact, for a fixed δ ∈ (δ ∗ , µ, by definition of cΨ
HZ we have H̃ ∈ Had (Uδ ∗ , ω) such that
∗
Ψ
max H̃ > cHZ (Uδ∗ , ω) − (δ − δ ). As in [41] (or [58, p. 315]) we take a smooth function

(a) f (t) = max H̃ for 0 ≤ t ≤ δ ∗ ,

∗
(b) f (t) = cΨ
HZ (Uδ , ω) + (δ − δ ) for δ ≤ t < ε,

(c) f ′ (t) > 0 for t ∈ (δ ∗ , δ) and f ′ (t) ∈ [0, L + 3] for all t ∈ [0, ε).
Define F : Uδ → R by setting F = H̃ on Uδ∗ , and F (x) = f (|H(x)|) for x ∈ Uδ \ Uδ∗ . Then
∗
Ψ
F ∈ HΨ (Uδ , ω) and max F = cΨ

and that cHZ (Uδ , ω) = cHZ (Cl(Uδ ), ω), where Cl(A) is the closure of A. Using the fact that
F is equal to a positive constant along γ we deduce that γ([0, T ]) is contained in Uδ \ Cl(Uδ∗ ).
This implies that H ◦ γ is eaual to a constant c in (δ ∗ , δ) or (−δ, −δ ∗ ) and
• γ̇(t) = f ′ (H(γ(t)))XH (γ(t)) on [0, T ] if c ∈ (δ ∗ , δ),
• γ̇(t) = −f ′ (−H(γ(t)))XH (γ(t)) on [0, T ] if c ∈ (−δ, −δ ∗ ).
Let τ = f ′ (|c|). It belongs to (0, L + 3). Note that the path [0, τ T ] ∋ t → y(t) = γ(t/τ ) sits in
Sc and satisfies Ψy(0) = y(τ T ) and



ẋ = XH (x) for the former case, i.e., c > 0,
ẋ = −XH (x) for the latter case, i.e., c < 0.

Moreover, 0 < τ T ≤ τ ≤ L + 3.
Take a sequence (δj ) in the interval (δ ∗ , µ) such that δj ↓ δ ∗ . By the arguments above we
have sequences λj ∈ (δ ∗ , δj and Tj ∈ (0, L + 3], j = 1, 2, · · · , such that for each j there exists
• either a Ψ-characteristic yj : [0, Tj ] → Sλj satisfying ẏ = XH (y),
• or a Ψ-characteristic yj : [0, Tj ] → S−λj satisfying ẏ = −XH (y).
These and Claim 7.1 imply: either Sλ∗ carries a Ψ-characteristic y : [0, T ] → Sλ∗ satisfying
ẏ = XH (y) and 0 < T ≤ L + 3, or S−λ∗ carries a Ψ-characteristic y : [0, T ] → S−λ∗ satisfying
ẏ = −XH (y) and 0 < T ≤ L + 3, or Sλ∗ ∪ S−λ∗ carries a fixed point of Ψ. Claim 7.2 is proved.
Step 3. For a nonzero λ ∈ I let P(Sλ , Ψ) consist of fixed points of Ψ and Ψ-characteristics
on Sλ satisfying ẏ = sign(λ)XH (y), where sign(λ) = 1 if λ > 0, and sign(λ) = −1 if λ < 0.
Since monotone nondecreasing function (0, ε) ∋ δ 7→ cΨ
HZ (Uδ , ω) ∈ R is differentiable almost
everywhere and thus Lipschitz continuous almost everywhere we derive from Step 2 that
Ĝ := {δ ∈ (0, ε) | P(Sδ , Ψ) 6= ∅ or P(S−δ , Ψ) 6= ∅} = {δ ∈ (0, ε) | δ ∈ G or − δ ∈ G}
has Lebesgue measure ε and thus satisfies the requirement in (i).
Step 4. For each n ∈ N let Λn be the set of nonzero parameters λ ∈ I = (−ε, ε) for which Sλ
contains either a fixed point of Ψ or a Ψ-characteristic y : [0, T ] → Sλ satisfying
0 < T ≤ n,

ẏ = XH (y) or ẏ = −XH (y).

Then Λn contains Gn , and is also closed and so Λ := ∪∞
n=1 Λn is a Lebesgue-measurable set.
By Step 3 the set {δ ∈ (0, ε) | δ ∈ Λ or − δ ∈ Λ} has Lebesgue measure ε. As in the proof of
[41] it follows from this that Λ has Lebesgue measure m(Λ) = 2ε.

7.2

Proof of Theorem 1.29

We closely follow [51, 52]. By the assumptions there exists δ0 > 0 such that R2n \ H −1 ([1 −
δ0 , 1 + δ0 ]) consists of a bounded component B containing the fixed point z0 of Ψ and an
unbounded one A. As the arguments at the beginning of Section 4 we may reduce to the case
z0 = 0. Then r0 := sup{τ > 0 | B 2n (0, τ ) ⊂ B} > 0. Clearly, shrinking δ0 we can also assume
that each β ∈ [1 − δ0 , 1 + δ0 ] is a regular value of H and Sβ := H −1 (β) is diffeomorphic to
S = S1 . Let γ be the diameter of H −1 ([1 − δ0 , 1 + δ0 ]). Then γ > r0 . Fix r ∈ (γ, 2γ). It is
clear that H −1 ([1 − δ0 , 1 + δ0 ]) ∪ B may be contained in the ball B 2n (0, r).
Fix a number β0 ∈ (1 − δ0 , 1 + δ0 ) and choose 0 < δ < (δ0 − |1 − β0 |)/3. Then the closure
of I0 := (β0 − δ, β0 + δ) is contained in (1 − δ0 , 1 + δ0 ). Define
Uδ = H −1 ([1 − δ0 + δ, 1 + δ0 − δ]) .

64

Let Aδ and Bδ be the unbounded and bounded components of R2n \ Uδ , respectively. Then
Uδ ∪ Bδ ⊂ B 2n (0, r). We modify the constant b and the smooth functions f, g in [29] such that

(7.2)

Since B 2n (0, r0 ) ⊂ B ⊂ Bδ and hence Hβ,m ≡ 0 in B 2n (0, r0 ) there exist constants C1 >
0, C2 > 0 independent of m ∈ N and β ∈ I0 , such that
|Hβ,m (z0 + x)| ≤ C1 |x|2

and |Hβ,m (z0 + x)| ≤ C2 |x|3

∀x ∈ R2n .

(7.3)

Moreover, for |x| large enough we have uniformly (in m ∈ N and β ∈ I0 ),
∇Hβ,m (x) = (t(Ψ) + 2ǫ)|x|2

and (Hβ,m )xx = (t(Ψ) + 2ǫ)I2n .

It follows that for some positive constants C3 , C4 independent of m ∈ N and β ∈ I0 ,
|∇Hβ,m (x)| ≤ (t(Ψ) + 2ǫ)|x|2 + C3

and |(Hβ,m )xx | ≤ C4 = (t(Ψ) + 2ǫ)I2n

(7.4)

on R2n . Checking the proofs of Propositions 2.9 and 2.10, conditions (7.1) and (7.3) are
1
sufficient if we take a = ( t(Ψ)
2 + ǫ) and z0 = 0. Hence Φβ,m is still a C -functional on
E satisfying the (PS) condition, and each critical point x of it is smooth and satisfies the
Hamiltonian boundary value problem
ẋ = XHβ,m (x)

and x(1) = Ψx(0).

(7.5)

By the proof of Proposition 2.7 the conditions in (7.4) also insures that ∇Φβ,m satisfies
k∇Φβ,m (x) − ∇Φβ,m (y)kE ≤ ℓkx − ykE
for some constant ℓ > 0 independent of m ∈ N and β ∈ I0 .
As in the proofs of [52, page 138, Lemma 9.2] we have:

65

∀x, y ∈ E

(7.6)

Claim 7.3. Let x ∈ E be a critical point of Φβ,m with Φβ,m (x) > 0. Then H(x(t)) ≡ h ∈ R
with |h − β| < δ/m,
Tx = mf ′ (m(H(x) − β)) > 0,
and y : [0, Tx] → R2n , t 7→ x(t/Tx ) satisfies: ẋ = XH (x) and x(Tx ) = Ψx(0).
Let E + , E 0 , E − be as in (2.11). Corresponding to [52, page 138, Lemma 9.3] there holds:
Claim 7.4. There exist numbers α > 0, ρ > 0 independent of m ∈ N and β ∈ I0 such that
Φβ,m (x) ≥ α for x ∈ Sρ+ = {x ∈ E + | kxkE = ρ}.
Proof. Since we do not know whether or not the space E in (2.11) can be embedded into some
Lp ([0, 1], R2n ) with p > 2, the proof of [52, page 138, Lemma 9.3] does not work in the present
case. However, because of estimates in (7.3), as in the proof of Proposition 3.5 we may still
use the method in the proof of [30, page 93, Lemma 9]. Indeed, it suffices to prove that

yj (t) → y(t) a.e. on (0, 1) and that |yj (t)| ≤ w(t) a.e. on (0, 1) and for each j. As in the proof

As in [52, page 134] let Γ̃ be the class of maps h ∈ C 0 (E, E) such that h is homotopic to
the identity through a family of maps ht = Lt + Kt , 0 ≤ t ≤ T , where L0 = idE , K0 = 0 and
Lt : E → E is a Banach space isomorphism satisfying Lt (E ∗ ) = E ∗ , ∗ = 0, +, −, and where
Kt is compact and ht (∂QR ) ∩ Sρ+ = ∅ for each t.
Repeating the proofs of [52, Lemmas 8.10,8.11] we can obtain that ∂QR and Sρ+ limk with
respect to Γ̃ and that the gradient flow G : E × [0, ∞) → E given by
∂

exists globally and G(·, T ) ∈ Γ̃ for any T ≥ 0. Hence G(∂QR , t) ∩ Sρ+ 6= ∅ for all t ≥ 0. By the

Corresponding to the critical value c(Hβ,m ) in (7.6) we have a critical point xβ,m ∈ E.
Since for each m ∈ N the map I0 ∋ β 7→ c(Hβ,m ) = Φβ,m (xβ,m ) is non-decreasing, as in the
∂
arguments on [52, page 140] we have Cβ := lim inf m→∞ ∂β
c(Hβ,m ) < ∞ for almost every
∂
β ∈ I0 . Fix such a β we get a subsequence Λ ⊂ N such that ∂β
c(Hβ,m ) → cβ as m ∈ Λ and
m → ∞. Repeating the proof of [52, Lemma 9.4] yields
Claim 7.7. For any m ∈ Λ there exists a critical point xβ,m of Φβ,m such that Φβ,m (xβ,m ) =
∂
Φβ,m (xβ,m ) ≤ Cβ + 4.
c(Hβ,m ) ≥ α and Tβ,m := ∂α
By Claim 7.3, xβ,m is smooth and satisfies H(xβ,m (t)) ≡ hβ,m ∈ (β − δ/m, β − δ/m) and



ẋβ,m = XHβ,m (xβ,m ) = mf ′ (m(H(xβ,m ) − β) XH (xβ,m ) = Tβ,m XH (xβ,m ),
xβ,m (1) = Ψxβ,m (0).

(7.11)

It follows that the sequences (xβ,m ) and (ẋβ,m ) are uniformly bounded and equi-continuous.
Since (Tβ,m ) is bounded we may assume Tβ,m → T ≤ Cβ + 1. By the Arzéla-Ascoli theorem
we get a subsequence xβ,mj converging in C 1 ([0, 1], R2n ) to a solution of
ẋ = T XH (x)

and x(1) = Ψx(0)

(7.12)

with H(x(t)) ≡ β. Note that A(xβ,mj ) ≥ Φβ,mj (xβ,mj ) ≥ α. Letting j → ∞ we get A(x) ≥ α.
This implies that x is non-constant and T > 0. Since H(x(t)) ≡ β, we obtain that x([0, 1]) ⊂ Uδ

Proof of Theorem 1.20

Under the assumptions of Theorem 1.20, for each number ǫ with |ǫ| small enough the set
Dǫ := D(e0 +ǫ) is a strictly convex bounded domain in R2n with 0 ∈ Dǫ and with C 2 -boundary
Sǫ = S(e0 + ǫ). Following the notations in Theorem 1.20 and Section 4 let Hǫ = (jDǫ )2 and
Hǫ∗ denote the Legendre transform of Hǫ . Both are C 1,1 on R2n , C 2 on R2n \ {0}, and have
positive Hessian matrixes at every point on R2n \ {0}.
Lemma 8.1 ([44, Lemma 3.2]). For every fixed x ∈ R2n \ {0}, ǫ 7→ Hǫ (x) is of class C 2 .

Since both ∇H(p) and ∇H0 (p) are out-normal vectors of S0 at p ∈ S0 we have a positive
function α : S0 → R such that ∇H(p) = α(p)∇H0 (p) for any p ∈ S0 . It follows that
h∇H(p), pi = α(p)h∇H0 (p), pi = 2α(p). This shows that α is C 1 and attains positive minimum

−J ẋ∗ (t) = ∇H0 (x∗ (t)), it is easily checked that [0, Tx∗ ] ∋ t 7→ y(t) := x∗ (g(t)) ∈ S0 satisfies
− J ẏ(t) = ∇H(y(t))

are functions of bounded variation in ǫ (and thus bounded near ǫ = 0), and ǫ 7→ C(e0 + ǫ) is
continuous. As in the proof of [44, Theorem 4.4], using these and Theorem 8.2 we may show
that C(ǫ) has, respectively, the left and right derivatives at ǫ = 0,
C′− (0) = lim T max (e0 + ǫ) = T max (e0 ) and

Fp = {x ∈ W 1,p ([0, 1], R2n ) | x(1) = Ψx(0) & x(0) ∈ E1⊥ },
which is a subspace of W 1,p ([0, 1], R2n ). Since the functional

Step 2. There exists u ∈ Ap such that Ip (u) = µp . Let (xn ) ⊂ Ap be a sequence satisfying

∀n ∈ N.

By (9.3) and the fact that kxkLp ≤ kxkL∞ , we deduce that (xn ) is bounded in W 1,p ([0, 1], R2n ).
Note that W 1,p ([0, 1]) is reflexive for p > 1. (xn ) has a subsequence, also denoted by (xn ),
which converges weakly to some u ∈ W 1,p ([0, 1], R2n ). By Arzelá-Ascoli theorem, there also
exists û ∈ C 0 ([0, 1], R2n ) such that
lim

sup |xn (t) − û(t)| = 0.

n→+∞ t∈[0,1]

A standard argument yields u(t) = û(t) almost everywhere. We may consider that xn converges
uniformly to u. Hence u(1) = Ψu(0) and u(0) ∈ E1⊥ . As in Step 2 of Section 4.1, we also
have Ap (u) = 1, and so u ∈ Ap . Standard argument in convex analysis shows that there exists
∗ p2
ω ∈ Lq ([0, 1], R2n ) such that ω(t) ∈ ∂(HD

hω(t), −J(u̇(t) − ẋn (t))idt → 0

as n → ∞,

since xn converges weakly to u. Hence µp ≤ Ip (u) ≤ limn→∞ Ip (xn ) = µp .
Step 3. There exists a generalized Ψ-characteristic on ∂D, x∗ : [0, 1] → ∂D, such that
2
A(x∗ ) = (µp ) p . Since u is the minimizer of Ip |Ap , applying Lagrangian multiplier theorem (cf.
[13, Theorem 6.1.1]) we get some λp ∈ R such that 0 ∈ ∂(Ip + λp A)(u) = ∂Ip (u) + λp A′ (u).
This means that there exists some ρ ∈ Lq ([0, 1], R2n ) satisfying

Proof of Corollary 1.24

(i) Since x, y ∈ Fix(Ψ), both Int(D) ∩ Fix(Ψ) − x and Int(D) ∩ Fix(Ψ) − y are intersecting with
Int(K), we deduce that for any 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1 interiors of λ(D ∩ (x + K)) and (1 − λ)(D ∩ (y + K))
contain fixed points of Ψ. (1.53) follows from Proposition 1.2 and Corollary 1.23 directly.
Suppose further that D and K are centrally symmetric, i.e., −D = D and −K = K. Then
Ψ
D ∩ (−x + K) = −(D ∩ (x + K)) and cΨ
EHZ (−(D ∩ (x + K))) = cEHZ (D ∩ (x + K)) since the
2n
2n
symplectomorphism R → R , z 7→ −z commutes with Ψ. Thus taking y = −x and λ = 1/2
Ψ
in (1.53) leads to cΨ
EHZ (D ∩ (x + K)) ≤ cEHZ (D ∩ K).
(ii) Let p ∈ Fix(Ψ) ∩ Int(D) and q ∈ Fix(Ψ) ∩ Int(K). In order to see the existence of the
limit in (1.54) note that
Ψ
Ψ
Ψ
cΨ
EHZ (D + εK) − cEHZ (D) = cEHZ ((D − p) + εK) − cEHZ (D − p)

and K ⊂ R(D − p) for some R > 0 (since 0 ∈ int(D − q)). We may deduce that the function of
ε > 0 in (1.54) is bounded. This function is also decreasing by Corollary 1.23 (see reasoning
[4, pages 21-22]), and so the desired conclusion is obtained.
The first inequality in (1.55) easily follows from Corollary 1.23. In order to prove the
second one let us fix a real p1 > 1. By Proposition 9.3 we have u ∈ Ap1 such that

Proofs of Theorems 1.42, 1.43

Proof of Claim 1.35. By the definition we may assume that ∆ ⊂ Rnq and Λ ⊂ Rnp contain
the origin in their interiors. We only need to prove that every proper A − (∆, B n ) billiard
trajectory cannot be contained in ∆ × ∂Λ. (Another case may be proved with the same
arguments.) Otherwise, let γ = (γq , γp ) : [0, T ] → ∂(∆ × Λ) be such a trajectory, that is,
γ([0, T ]) ⊂ ∆ × ∂Λ. Then γ −1 (∂∆ × ∂Λ) is finite (including empty) and there holds
γ̇(t) = (γ̇q (t), γ̇p (t)) = (κ∇jΛ (γp (t)), 0)

∀t ∈ [0, T ] \ γ −1 (∂∆ × ∂Λ)

for some positive constant κ. It follows that γp is constant on each component of [0, T ] \
γ −1 (∂∆×∂Λ), and so constant on [0, T ]\γ −1(∂∆×∂Λ) by continuity of γ. Hence γp ≡ p0 ∈ ∂Λ,
and so γq (t) = q0 + κt∇jΛ (p0 ) on [0, T ], where q0 = γq (0). Now
(q0 + κT ∇jΛ (p0 ), p0 ) = γ(T ) = ΨA γ(0) = (Aγq (0), (At )−1 γp (0)) = (Aq0 , (At )−1 p0 ).
This implies that At p0 = p0 and q0 − Aq0 = −κT ∇jΛ (p0 ). The former equality leads to
hp0 , v − Avi = 0 ∀v ∈ Rn . Combing this with the latter equality we obtain hp0 , ∇jΛ (p0 )i = 0.
This implies jΛ (p0 ) = 0 and so p0 = 0, which contradicts p0 ∈ ∂Λ since 0 ∈ int(Λ).
✷
Proof of Claim 1.37. Firstly, we prove (1.74) in the case that 0 ∈ Int(∆) and 0 ∈ Int(Λ).

on jΛ−1 (1). Note that

So −(qi+1 − qi , pi )Rn must be the maximum of the function p 7→ −(qi+1 − qi , p)Rn on jΛ−1 (1),
which by definition equals hΛ (qi − qi+1 ). In this case (1.74) follows immediately.
Next, we deal with the general case. Now we have q̄ ∈ Int(∆) and p̄ ∈ Int(Λ) such that
the above result can be applied to γ − (q̄, p̄) yielding

A(γ − (q̄, 0). Since πq (γ) − q̄ and πq (γ) have the same length, we only need to prove the case
q̄ = 0.
Since γ is gliding, by Claim 1.36 we have
γ̇(t) = (γ̇q (t), γ̇p (t)) = (−α(t)γp (t)/|γp (t)|, β(t)∇g∆ (γq (t))),
where α and β are two smooth positive functions satisfying a condition as in [5, (8)]. Hence

✷
Proof of Claim 1.38. Since the affine linear symplectomorphism Φ(q̄,p̄) in (1.73) maps
generalized ΨA -characteristics on ∂(∆ × Λ) to such characteristics on ∂((∆ − q̄) × (Λ − p̄)) in
one-to-one way, we only need to consider the case that ∆ ⊂ Rnq and Λ ⊂ Rnp contain the origin
in their interiors. Note that the normal cones N∆×Λ (q, p) = N∆ (p) × NΛ (p) by Corollary of
[13, page 55], and
∂j∆×Λ (q, p) = {x∗ ∈ N∆×Λ (q, p) | hx∗ , (q, p)i = 1},

∂j∆ (q) = {v ∗ ∈ N∆ (q) | hv ∗ , qi = 1},

∂jΛ (p) = {u∗ ∈ NΛ (p) | hu∗ , pi = 1}

(see the proof of [17, Lemma V.1.2]) we deduce that
N∆×Λ (q, p) = R+ ∇j∆×Λ (q, p) if

(q, p) ∈ (Int(∆) × ∂Λ) ∪ (∂∆ × Int(Λ)),

N∆×Λ (q, p) = R+ (∇j∆ (q), 0) + R+ (0, ∇jΛ (p))

if (q, p) ∈ (∂∆ × ∂Λ).

It follows that JN∆×Λ (q, p) = R+ X(q, p) in the first case, and JN∆×Λ (q, p) \ {0} is equal to
the set of (1.71) in the second case. These imply the expected claim.
✷
Proof of Claim 1.39. By the definitions we only need to consider the case that 0 ∈ Int(∆).
Let σ : [0, T ] → ∆ be a A-billiard trajectory in ∆ with Bσ = {t1 < · · · < tk } ⊂ (0, T ) as in
Definition 1.32. Then |σ̇(t)| is equal a positive constant κ in (0, T ) \ Bσ .
Suppose that (ABiii) occurs. Define
1
α1 (t) = (σ(t), − σ̇ + (0)), 0 ≤ t ≤ t1 ,
κ
t
1
β1 (t) = (σ(t1 ), − σ̇ + (0) + (σ̇ − (t1 ) − σ̇ + (t1 )),
κ
κ

0 ≤ t ≤ 1.

Since the second equality in (1.57) implies that σ̇ − (ti ) − σ̇ + (ti ) is an outer normal vector to
∂∆ at σ(ti ) for each ti ∈ Bσ , it is easily checked that both are generalized characteristics on

80

∂(∆ × Λ) and α1 (t1 ) = β1 (0). Similarly, define
1
α2 (t) = (σ(t), − σ̇ + (t1 )), t1 ≤ t ≤ t2 ,

Then β1 (1) = α2 (t1 ), α2 (t2 ) = β2 (0), · · · , βk (1) = αk+1 (tk ), that is, α1 β1 · · · αk βk αk+1 is a
path. Note also that

κ
by (1.61). Hence γ := α1 β1 · · · αk βk αk+1 is a generalized ΨA -characteristic on ∂(∆ × Λ).

Suppose that (ABiv) occurs. Let αi and βj be defined as above for i = 1, · · · , k + 1 and
j = 1, · · · , k. If (1.61) holds, we also define γ as above, and get a generalized ΨA -characteristic
on ∂(∆ × Λ).
If (1.62) occurs, we also need to define

β0 (t) = (σ(0), − σ̇ − (0) + (σ̇ − (0) − σ̇ + (0)),
κ
κ

0 ≤ t ≤ 1.

By (1.60), σ̇ − (0) − σ̇ + (0) is an outer normal vector to ∂∆ at σ(0). It is easy to see that β0 is
a generalized characteristic on ∂(∆ × Λ) satisfying β0 (1) = α1 (0). Moreover

by (1.62). Thus γ := β0 α1 β1 · · · αk βk αk+1 is a generalized ΨA -characteristic on ∂(∆ × Λ).
Suppose that (ABv) occurs. If (1.61) holds, we define γ as in the case of (ABv). When

Then γ := α1 β1 · · · αk βk αk+1 βk+1 is a generalized ΨA -characteristic on ∂(∆ × Λ).
Suppose that (ABvi) occurs. If (1.61) or (1.62) or (1.63) holds, we define
γ := α1 β1 · · · αk βk αk+1 ,

or γ := β0 α1 β1 · · · αk βk αk+1 ,

or γ := α1 β1 · · · αk βk αk+1 βk+1 .

Finally, if (1.64) holds, we define γ := β0 α1 β1 · · · αk βk αk+1 βk+1 .

Proof of Theorem 1.42. Let λ ∈ (0, 1). Since Int(∆1 ) ∩ Fix(A) 6= ∅, Int(∆2 ) ∩ Fix(A) 6= ∅
and Int(Λ) ∩ Fix(At ) 6= ∅, Fix(ΨA ) is intersecting with both Int(∆1 × Λ) and Int(∆2 × Λ).

Some facts on symplectic matrixes

Lemma A.1. For Ψ ∈ Sp(2n, R), the set of zeros of the function g Ψ defined by (1.13) in
(0, 2π] is a nonempty finite set. Moreover, the smallest zero t(Ψ) is equal to 2π if Ψ = I2n and
t(Ψ) is equal to π if Ψ = −I2n .
Proof. By [12, Corollary 3] the function g Ψ must have a zero in (0, 2π]. Since g Ψ is analytic,
we get that g Ψ has at most finite zeros in the interval (0, 2π].
Since J is unitarily similar to

and thus that det(Ψ − etJ ) = 0 ⇔ t = θj for some 1 ≤ j ≤ n. Hence arrive at the following
refinement of Lemma A.1.
Lemma A.3. Let Ψ ∈ Sp(2n, R) ∩ O(2n) be as in (1.36), and let 0 < θ1 ≤ · · · ≤ θn ≤ 2π be as
in (1.37). Then the set of zeros of the function g Ψ defined by (1.13) in (0, 2π] is {θ1 , · · · , θ2n }.
In particular, t(Ψ) = θ1 .
Let {e1 , f1 = Je1 , · · · , en , fn = Jen } be the standard basis of R2n , i.e. ej ∈ R2n is the unit
vector whose the j-th component equals 1 and others are zero. Then

A global analysis theorem

The following result is taken from the page 780 of [22].
Proposition B.1. Let M , N and P be finite-dimensional C ∞ -manifolds. If both M and N are
compact then the map comp : C r+s (N, P )×C r (M, N ) → C r (M, P ) given by comp(f, g) = f ◦g
is C s . In particular, the evaluation map C r (N, P ) × N → P is C r .
For a detailed proof of it we refer to [23]. Another consequence is
Corollary B.2. Under the assumptions of Proposition B.1, each map ψ ∈ C r+s (N × M, P )
gives rise to a C s map
N → C r (M, P ), p 7→ ψ(p, ·).

85

In fact, Proposition B.1 implies that the composition
comp : C r+s (N × M, P ) × C r (M, N × M ) → C r (M, P ), (f, g) 7→ f ◦ g
is C s . Note that the map
N ∋ p 7→ gp ∈ C r (M, N × M )
defined by gp (m) = (p, m) for m ∈ M is smooth. We get a C s map
N → C r (M, P ), p 7→ comp(ψ, gp ) = ψ(p, ·).
