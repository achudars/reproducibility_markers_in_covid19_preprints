Photon emission and absorption by an individual qubit are essential elements for the quantum
manipulation of light. Here we demonstrate the controllability of spontaneous emission of a qubit
in various electromagnetic environments. The parameter regimes that allow for flexible control of
the qubit emission routes are comprehensively discussed. By properly tuning the system couplings
and decay rates, the spontaneous emission rate of the qubit can undergo Purcell enhancement and
inhibition. Particularly, when the cavity is prepared in the excited state, the spontaneous emission
rate of the qubit can be significantly suppressed. We also demonstrate a spectral filter effect which
can be realised by controlling the steady-state emission spectra of qubits.

INTRODUCTION

Atom-photon quantum interfaces are key building
blocks for a quantum network, with applications including quantum sensing [1], cryptography [2] and quantum
information processing [3]. The basic component of a
quantum network comprises local nodes (atoms) used
to store or process quantum information. These nodes
are connected by quantum channels for photons (“flying
qubits”) to be used to distribute quantum information
[3–6] and entanglement [7] over the network. Information
transfer can be accomplished by either directly absorbing
the flying qubit [4] or through projective measurements
[8–11]. As a result, controlling fundamental processes of
photon emission and absorption by qubits [12] is essential
to utilise quantum information.
Over the years, many quantum optical schemes have
been developed for the temporal and spectral manipulations of the photon emission and absorption processes of
qubits. [13–19]. Among these systems, cavity and circuit
quantum electrodynamic systems [20, 21] are promising
candidates for distributed quantum information processing [22, 23] due to their advantages of in situ tunability and individual addressing of cavity/circuit elements
[24], spectroscopic technology for state readout [25], and
scalability [26, 27]. In recent years, these systems displayed a wide range of experimental results, from photon
blockade and single-photon generation to quantum state
transfer between atoms and photons [5, 23, 28–30]; from
long distance quantum networks [31] to scalable quantum
network which is essential for applications in quantum
computing [32, 33]. Strong nonlinearity of the system,
which is an essential requirement for these applications,
can be achieved in the strong coupling regime [34, 35].
In this paper, we comprehensively study the manipulation of the spontaneous emission (SE) of qubits in

various electromagnetic environments, including another
qubit and cavity, from weak to strong coupling regime.
The equation-of-motion method is applied to obtain various propagators for single and double excitations of the
system. For the spontaneous emission, the Purcell enhancement and inhibition are observed in the temporal
domain; particularly, we find that preparing the electromagnetic environment in the excited state will significantly slow down the spontaneous emission of the qubit.
Furthermore, examining each involved propagator provides more insights on the emission routes of the qubit.
We also give some frequency domain results demonstrating how the emission spectra can be utilised as a frequency filter when the system reaches steady state. The
physical insights developed here allow for great control
over the photon emission process of the qubit which is
useful in the fields of quantum information and communication.
The paper is organised as follows. In Section II we
introduce the general model for describing two qubits
in a cavity. In the subsequent sections we focus on the
dynamical evolution of transition probabilities for several
special cases which are derived by simplifying the original
model. This includes the two-qubit model in Section III
and the two-excitation Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM)
in Section IV. The general model is treated in detail in
Section V, which includes a discussion of our steady-state
results in the spectral domain. We conclude the results
in Section VI, and the appendices provide further details
on the calculations made in above sections.

MODEL AND HAMILTONIAN

The system in consideration is basically the TavisCummings model (TCM) [36, 37] where only two qubits
(labelled as 1 and 2) are coupled to a single mode cavity. The qubits couple via dipole-dipole interactions g12
and interact with the cavity via couplings g1 and g2 respectively. The Hamiltonian is given by (setting h̄ = 1)

where the transition frequencies of the qubits and the
resonant frequency of the cavity are ω01 , ω02 and ωc respectively. The energies of the atomic excited states are
defined as identically zero. The bosonic operators for
the cavity mode are a† and a, satisfying the canonical
commutation relation [a, a† ] = 1.
To study the open system dynamics of the system,
the qubits and cavity are coupled by three independent
baths,
Hb =

i=1

where Γ1 , Γ2 and κ are the decay rates of qubits and
cavity in the Wigner-Weisskopf approximation [38]. Thus
the total Hamiltonian for the open system is given by
H = Hs + Hb + Hs-b .
In the following, we shall study the manipulation of the
spontaneous emission of the initially excited qubit 1 in
various electromagnetic environments (EME) including
i) another qubit; ii) a cavity and iii) Jaynes-Cummings
environment where each EME is prepared in its ground
state and/or single-excited state.

Note that the propagators involved in the SE can be organized as a network as depicted in Fig. 1. It is shown
that the quantum states are connected by either a decay or coupling process. Using the Laplace transform

which are the probabilities for excited state survival of
qubit 1, excitation exchange between the qubits, and
exchange-emission mediated by qubit 2, respectively.
Here ∆2 ≡ ω2 − ω01 − ω02 . Now we shall discuss the
above probabilities in detail.
First, we demonstrate that by tuning the coupling
strength and decay rates, the spontaneous emission rate
can be efficiently modified. The plots in Fig. 2 are for the
analytical solutions from the Laplace transform method,
which are checked to agree with the numerical solutions
to the Schrödinger equation. In Fig. 2(a) where qubit 1 is
resonantly coupled with qubit 2, the survival probability
of qubit 1 Psurv (t) decays faster compared to the freespace emission when Γ1 < Γ2 . This is the well-known

Purcell enhancement [39]. In the strong coupling regime
where g12 > (Γ1 , Γ2 ), it is expected that vacuum Rabi
oscillations are observed. In contrast to Purcell enhancement, the inhibition of spontaneous emission of qubit 1
can be observed when Γ1 > Γ2 . Due to Rabi oscillations,
the survival probability exceeds the free-space value at
certain times, as shown in Fig. 2(b). The mechanism is
that when the decay rate of qubit 2 is smaller than the
decay rate of qubit 1, the capacity of energy storage for
qubit 2 is better than that for qubit 1. Qubit 2 serves
as an energy storage to repeatedly feedback the energy
to qubit 1 via g12 coupling which suppresses spontaneous
emission of qubit 1. Thus, we can control the SE of qubit
1 by tuning the decay rate of qubit 2 in the strong coupling regime.
Next, we discuss the dominant emission route during
the SE of qubit 1. The system has two emission routes:
qubit 1 emission via Γ1 , and qubit 2 emission via Γ2 .
Fig. 3(b) shows the dynamical evolution of the different
probabilities in Eq. (7) in the weak coupling regime. It
is shown that the photon is more likely to emit via qubit
1, even though Γ2 > Γ1 . In the strong coupling regime
however, the decay via qubit 2 dominates as depicted in
Fig. 3(c). This shows that the coupling strength is more
crucial than Γ2 in determining the relative dominance
of emission routes of qubit 1. The difference between
PSE (t) and Pem2 (t) in the steady state provides a quantitative measure of this behaviour. This probability gap
PSE (t → ∞) − Pem2 (t → ∞) is shown in the contour
plot in Fig. 3(a). For any value of g12 , increasing Γ2
will first cause the decrease of the gap which indicates
that qubit 2 starts to emit photons; the gap increases
again when qubit 2 enters the bad-atom regime (large
Γ2 ) where Purcell enhancement of qubit 1 is expected.
For weak coupling, the gap is always positive, indicating
that qubit 1 relaxation dominates over qubit 2 relaxation.
Under strong coupling, it is interesting that the probability gap can reach negative values, indicating that the
emission route via qubit 2 outweighs that of qubit 1. This
phenomenon is exclusive for strong coupling which is imprinted in the oscillation behavior in the time evolution
of probabilities as shown in Fig. 3(c). Our results also
suggest that for a value of g12 , there exists an optimal
Γ2 which maximises the steady-state probability of qubit
2 emission Pem2 (t → ∞). Note that the normalisation
condition requires Pem2 (t → ∞) + Pem1 (t → ∞) = 1.
The variation of the optimal Γ2 with g12 is indicated by
the white dashed line in Fig. 3(a).

B.

Qubit 2 prepared in excited state

The situation becomes more interesting if the EME
of qubit 1, i.e., qubit 2 is also prepared in the excited
state such that both qubits are initially excited, i.e., state
|e1 e2 i. In this case, qubit 2, now in a higher energy state,
serves as an energy charger to pump energy into qubit 1
and prolong its lifetime.

To analyse the effect of the excited qubit 2 on
the spontaneous emission of the qubit 1, we consider
the survival probability of qubit 1 in its excited state
|e1 i. Three propagators are involved in this process:
the survival probability of state |e1 e2 i, Psurv (t) =
|he1 e2 |U (t)|e1 e2 i|2 ; the single-photon emission probability via qubit 2, Pem2 (t, ∆2 ) = |he1 g2 |b2 (ω2 )U (t)|e1 e2 i|2
and the emission-exchange probability Pemx1 (t, ∆1 ) =
|he1 g2 |b1 (ω1 )U (t)|e1 e2 i|2 . The survival probability of
qubit 1 is then given by Ptotal (t) = Psurv (t) + Pem2 (t) +
Pemx1 (t), where Pem2 (t) and Pemx1 (t) are obtained by integrating their frequency-resolved probabilities over their
respectively emission frequencies. By the Schrödinger
equation as above, the survival probability of state

respectively. Here ω0 = 12 (ω01 + ω02 ), Γ = 12 (Γ1 + Γ2 ),
∆ω0 = ω01 − ω02 and ∆Γ = Γ1 − Γ2 .
Now we study the spontaneous emission of qubit 1 for
both weak and strong dipole-dipole couplings. The parameters used are g12 = 0.5Γ1 for weak coupling and
g12 = 5Γ1 for strong coupling. The time evolution of
the survival probability of qubit 1, Ptotal (t) is plotted
in Figs. 2(c) and 2(d). Here the blue dashed line is the
SE in the free space for comparison. Both the Purcell enhancement and inhibition are observed in the system; the
SE of qubit 1 is enhanced when Γ2 > Γ1 while inhibited
when Γ2 < Γ1 (red solid curve). This is true for both
weak and strong coupling. The inhibition of SE originates from the “charger” effect which happens when the
qubit 2 is in excited state and has lower decay rate than
qubit 1. In the weak coupling regime, the enhancement is
not significant, in contrast to the very large enhancement
present in strong coupling regime. For both cases however, increasing Γ2 to extremely large values will push
qubit 2 into the bad-atom regime and cause the correlation between the qubits to decay exponentially; the SE of
qubit 1 will approach the free space case. Additionally,
by fine tuning the decay rates to Γ1 = Γ2 , the two qubits
are identical, and the survival probability of qubit 1 is
not affected by the excited qubit 2, i.e. Ptotal (t) = e−Γ1 t
[40]. Therefore, in the strong coupling regime, the SE
of qubit 1 can be significantly manipulated by the decay rate of qubit 2. Comparing with qubit 2 (the EME)
prepared in the ground state in Fig. 2(b), the inhibition
effect of qubit 1 is much stronger when qubit 2 is initially
prepared in the excited state.
To further understand the oscillating behaviour in the
Purcell inhibition regime in Fig. 2(d), we study the three

5

FIG. 3. (color online). (a) Variation of the gap PSE (t → ∞) − Pem2 (t → ∞) between the qubit 1 decay probability and qubit 2
decay probability in steady state as a function of Γ2 and g12 . The white dashed line indicates the optimal Γ2 which maximises
Pem2 (t → ∞) for each g12 . The parameters for time evolution of probabilities PSE (t) and Pem2 (t) in Eq. (5) and Eq. (7) are
(b) g12 = 0.5Γ1 , Γ2 = 3Γ1 (weak coupling regime); (c) g12 = 5Γ1 , Γ2 = 3Γ1 (strong coupling regime).

contributions to Ptotal (t). For Γ2 = 0.2Γ1 in Fig. 4(a)
and 4(b), the spontaneous emission of qubit 1 is suppressed. In the strong coupling regime (g12 = 5Γ1 ), the
dipole-dipole coupling sets up a Rabi oscillation in the
system, hence causing Ptotal (t) to exhibit oscillatory behaviour. The oscillating effect is mainly due to Pemx1 (t)
which directly involves the coupling process g12 as shown
in Eq. (9). Due to the small Γ2 , the contribution from
Pem2 (t) is not as significant. The oscillation is small because both qubits are initially in the excited state, making it difficult for Rabi oscillation to form at initial times.
This is contrasted with the large vacuum Rabi oscillation
in the single-excitation case plotted in Fig. 2(a) and 2(b),
where qubit 2 is initially in the ground state. In comparison, for large Γ2 = 4Γ1 in Fig. 4(c) and 4(d), Purcell
enhancement is observed. Due to large Γ2 , the contribution from Pemx1 (t) is not as significant. The enhancement effect is mainly due to Pem2 (t). In the weak coupling regime, the emission-exchange probability Pemx1 (t)
is negligible, hence there is little Purcell enhancement
from the free-space case. In the strong coupling regime
however, a significant Rabi oscillation between the qubits
results in a large enhancement in spontaneous emission.
We now show the controllability of decay channels for
the SE of the system. When the subsystem of coupled
qubits is exposed to the environments, it will eventually
decay to its ground state |g1 g2 i through various emission
routes. During this process,
there are three sub-processes

involved: Pem11 (t) =
d∆1 d∆01 Pem11 (t, ∆1 , ∆01 ),

where both photons
are emitted via qubit 1;

both

−∞
where each qubit emits one photon. (For explicit
expressions of the frequency-resolved propagators, please
refer to Appendix A). By studying the probabilities
of these two-photon emission sub-processes in different
parameters, it may be useful in optimising the desired
emission route or to suppress unwanted emissions for
applications. Here we first study these probabilities
in the long-time limit. From Fig. 5(a) to 5(c), it can
be seen that in spite of the dipole-dipole interaction

FIG. 4. (color online). Various contributions for the survival probability of state |e1 i (blue solid) in weak and strong
coupling regimes. The purple dashed, green dash-dotted and
red dotted curves are for the survival probability of |e1 e2 i,
the single-photon emission probability via qubit 2, and the
emission-exchange probability in Eq. (8-9). The parameters
are (a) g12 = 0.5Γ1 , Γ2 = 0.2Γ1 ; (b) g12 = 5Γ1 , Γ2 = 0.2Γ1 ;
(c) g12 = 0.5Γ1 , Γ2 = 4Γ1 ; (d) g12 = 5Γ1 , Γ2 = 4Γ1 .

strength g12 , the probability Pem11 is greatest due to
small decay rate Γ2 of qubit 2. In contrast, when both
g12 and Γ2 is large, Pem22 is large. The final state
has a high emission probability through qubit 2 and
decays in state b†2 b†2 |g1 g2 i. Under weak dipole-dipole
coupling, Ptotal12 dominates the emission process.
The corresponding time-evolutions of the two-photon
emission probabilities are also shown from Fig. 5(d) to
5(f). For example, in Fig. 5(d), Pem11 is the dominant
probability when g12 = 6Γ1 , Γ2 = 0.1Γ1 . Similarly,
Pem11 dominates when g12 = 8Γ1 , Γ2 = 15Γ1 as in Fig.
5(e), and Ptotal12 dominates when g12 = Γ1 , Γ2 = 10Γ1
as in Fig. 5(f). The time-evolution results are consistent
with the steady-state results from Fig. 5(a) to 5(c). We
summarise the dominant emission process in various
regimes in Tab. (I) which might find its use in controlling
the emission routes for applications.

SINGLE QUBIT COUPLED TO A CAVITY:
TWO EXCITATIONS

Here we put the qubit 1 into a cavity and study
the influence to the SE of the qubit 1. Thus we set
g2 = g12 = ω02 = Γ2 = 0 in Eq. (1) to Eq. (3);
the whole system simplifies to the well-known JaynesCummings model. In our study, the cavity is initially
prepared either in the ground state |0i or Fock state |1i.
The effect of the cavity in ground state |0i is equivalent
to the two-qubit system with qubit 2 in the ground state
|g2 i. Thus, the phenomena discussed in Sec. III A (Purcell effect, Rabi oscillations, control of decay channel) are
present here as well.
For the double excitation case, we initially set the cavity in the Fock state |1i so that the initial state of the
system is a† |e1 i. By the similar method as shown in Eq.
(4), we obtain a closed differential system of propagators
for calculations with the assumption that the network of
quantum states shown in Fig. 6 is terminated whenever
both the qubit and cavity reach ground state. The cutoff of the network is depicted by the red dashed arrows
in Fig. 6.
From the network of quantum states, we find that com-

by the dashed arrows.

pared with the two-qubit double excitation system, there
is a new branch of states with double occupation of cavity
mode, i.e., Fock state |n = 2i during the time evolution
of the system. This makes the SE of qubit 1 different
from the two-qubit system with two excitations. Fig.
2(e) and 2(f) show the transition from Purcell inhibition
to enhancement as κ is increased. Comparing with the
single-excitation JCM in Fig. 2(a) and 2(b), the inhibition effect is enhanced since the survival probability only

blue solid curve for the rest of the time. Comparing with

suppressed. The previous work by Sete et al. [41] considered the suppression of spontaneous emission in JCM
by detuning the resonator with the qubit, thus decreasing
their spectral overlap. In this work, we further conclude
the inhibition effect due to differences in the decay rates
between the qubit and cavity in both strong and weak
coupling regimes.

TWO QUBITS COUPLED TO A CAVITY:
SINGLE EXCITATION

In previous sections, we have found that a single excited qubit in a cavity (JCM) exhibits both Purcell enhancement and inhibition, and that the two-qubit system
contains identical behaviour as JCM with initial Fock
state |n = 0i. In the general system of Eq. (1), there
are three couplings involved: g1 between qubit 1 and
cavity, g2 between qubit 2 and cavity, and g12 between
the qubits. Whether these couplings are cooperative or
competitive to the spontaneous emission of qubit 1 is our
topic of study here. Note that the present system can be
regarded as a Tavis-Cummings model [37]. In this section, we study the system in both time domain in Sec.
V A and frequency domain in Sec. V B.

A.

Time evolution of transition probabilities

By the similar method as shown in Eq. (4), we obtain a
closed differential system of propagators for calculations.
The network of quantum states is shown in Fig. 7. The
expressions for survival probability of qubit 1, Psurv (t) =
|he1 g2 |U (t)|e1 g2 i|2 ; the spontaneous emission probability
of qubit 1, Pem1 (t, ∆1 ) = |hg1 g2 |b1 (ω1 )U (t)|e1 g2 i|2 ;
the exchange-emission probability via qubit 2,
Pemx2 (t, ∆2 ) = |hg1 g2 |b2 (ω2 )U (t)|e1 g2 i|2 and the
exchange-emission
probability
via
the
cavity,
Pemr (t, ∆r ) = |hg1 g2 b3 (ωr )U (t)|e1 g2 i|2 are given in
Appendix B.
It is observed that the spontaneous emission of qubit
1 can be either enhanced or inhibited as shown in Fig.
2(g) and Fig. 2(h), respectively. As discussed in previous

FIG. 8. (color online). Survival probability in Eq. (B1) of
qubit 1 for illustrating the detuning effect of g2 . The parameters are κ = Γ2 = Γ1 and (a) g1 = 5Γ1 , g12 = 5Γ1 (g1 = g12 );
(b) g1 = 5Γ1 , g12 = 2Γ1 (g1 6= g12 ).

sections, the condition for inhibition in JCM is κ < Γ1 ,
or Γ2 < Γ1 in the equivalent two-qubit system. In the
current system however, slight inhibition is still observed
even if Γ2 > Γ1 , provided κ is sufficiently smaller than
Γ1 .
In Fig. 2(g), it can be seen that when g2 is the
dominant coupling (green dashed-dotted curve), the survival probability approaches the free-space case (blue
solid curve). This can be explained as follows: For
g2  (g1 , g12 ), when qubit 1 emits into the cavity, the
cavity photon is most likely to be absorbed by qubit 2 to
set up a Rabi oscillation between qubit 2 and the cavity.
Hence, the Rabi oscillation between qubit 1 and cavity is
suppressed. Moreover, the cavity photon does not get absorbed back by qubit 1 easily since g2 is dominant. As a
result, qubit 1 effectively decouples from the system, and
the emission behaviour favours spontaneous emission via
Γ1 . The decoupling effect of g2 is seen more clearly in Fig.
8. When g1 = g12 , the oscillations are coherent. Increasing g2 leads to greater effective decoupling between qubit
1 and its EME, and the survival probability of qubit 1 approaches the free-space curve. On the other hand, when
g1 6= g12 , the oscillations become out of phase. Physically, g1 and g12 are both responsible for separate Rabi
oscillations involving qubit 1. If g1 6= g12 , the two Rabi
frequencies are different, leading to a more complicated
interference result. Also, in this case, the decoupling effect of g2 is only significant if g2 is the largest coupling
constant, as shown in Fig. 8(b). From our result, we
can conclude that g1 and g12 are cooperative couplings
significant to the enhancement or inhibition of spontaneous emission. On the other hand, g2 , which does not
involve qubit 1 directly, serves as an effective decoupling
parameter competing with g1 and g12 .
By symmetry, it can be seen that the effect of qubit 2
and cavity on qubit 1 is equivalent. Thus, we set g1 =
g12 and Γ2 = κ without loss of generality. The system
exhibits three decay channels: atomic dissipation via Γ1
and Γ2 , and cavity dissipation via κ. The last two are
treated to be the same in this section. We first study the
control of decay channels by fixing g1 = g12 = Γ1 , and
vary Γ2 and g2 . The results are plotted in Figs. 9(a) and
9(b) .
Due to the decoupling effect of g2 , an increase in g2

causes qubit 1 to effectively decouple from qubit 2 and
cavity. Thus, Pem1 increases while Pemx2 and Pemr decreases, which is reflected in Fig. 9 (see Appendix B for
detailed expressions of Pem1 , Pemx2 and Pemr ). For small
g2 , as κ is increased, Pem1 decreases to a minimum, and
then increase again. The explanation is that as κ = Γ2 increases, the decay rate of the cavity and qubit 2 increases,
causing qubit 1 to have a lowered emission probability.
However, when κ = Γ2 is too large, qubit 1 effectively
decouples from its EME, causing Pem1 to increase again
as it approaches its free space value. This dip in Pem1 is
not significant for large g2 , since qubit 1 is already significantly decoupled due to g2 , so the qubit becomes less
sensitive to changes in κ.
We then increase the coupling of qubit 1 by setting
g1 = g12 = 3Γ1 . The results are shown in Fig. 9(c).
Since qubit 1 is more strongly coupled to qubit 2 and the
cavity, it is expected that its emission probability is more
sensitive to the parameters κ, Γ2 and g2 . As shown in
Fig. 9(c), the dip in Pem1 occurs over a bigger range of κ.
Also, the minimum Pem1 is lowered from 0.45 in Fig. 9(a)
to 0.2 in Fig. 9(c). Due to stronger couplings, a larger g2
is required to cause the same effective decoupling, thus
the dip is significant even at moderately large g2 .
B.

Steady state emission spectra

In previous sections, we have studied in detail the control of SE in the temporal domain. If, instead of integrating the probability over all emission frequencies, we take
the long-time limit (t → ∞), the emission spectra can be
obtained. Here we report the spectral filter effect where
the spectrum of an input photon can be significantly
modified by a process involving the spontaneous Raman
scattering. This effect may be useful in, for example, converting a broadband input spectrum into an ultranarrow
output spectrum. The process in consideration is as follow: a single photon with the input spectrum ψ(∆2 −∆1 ),
where ∆2 = ω2 − ω02 , ∆1 = ω1 − ω01 , is absorbed by
qubit 1 to cause the transition b†1 (ω)|g1 g2 i → |e1 g2 i. The
two qubits then exchange excitation |e1 g2 i → |g1 e2 i via
dipole-dipole coupling . Finally, qubit 2 undergoes spontaneous emission, and the resulting photon can be re-

garded as the Stokes/anti-Stokes photon, depending on
the difference between ω01 and ω02 . Thus, the final state
is b†2 (ω2 )|g1 g2 i.
Previous work [38] found that for a Λ-system with
single-photon excitation, the spontaneous Raman spectrum is the product of the the input photon spectrum
2
|ψ(∆2 − ∆1 )| and the atomic SE spectrum PSE (∆2 ).
Our calculations further generalise the result in Ref.
[38] by showing that the relation is valid for the cavity coupled two-qubit system by replacing the atomic
SE spectrum with the exchange-emission spectrum of
qubit 2, Pemx2 (∆2 ). Thus, through suitable tuning of
the exchange-emission spectrum of qubit 2 and the relative positions of the qubit and cavity peaks, the output
spectrum can be significantly controlled.
We now first study the control of SE in the frequency
domain. Following our earlier analysis, g2 primarily functions as an effective decoupling parameter, which we
set as zero here without loss of generality. Hence, the
area-normalised exchange-emission spectrum for qubit 2
SSE (∆2 ) can be written as
SSE (∆2 ) =

Pemx2 (∆2 ),

where N is the normalisation constant and the probability Pemx2 (∆2 ) is the long-time limit of Pemx2 (∆2 , t) in Eq.
(B3). In steady-state, the Raman scattering spectrum is

For simplicity, we also assume no atomic detuning in the

The area-normalised exchange-emission spectrum
SSE (∆2 ) contains three peaks. Referring to the blue solid

1, the middle peak with qubit 2 and the right peak with
cavity. For brevity, we label these peaks as qubit 1 peak,
qubit 2 peak, and cavity peak respectively. Thus, increasing g12 in Fig. 10(a) causes Rabi splitting in the qubit
peaks, leaving behind the cavity peak near ∆2 = ∆c .
Since κ  Γ1 , the cavity peak displays a Fano lineshape.
Increasing g1 in Fig. 10(b) shifts the qubit 1 peak and
cavity peak instead, leaving behind the qubit 2 peak near
∆2 = 0.
In the case of Γ2 > (Γ1 , g12 ), energy in qubit 2 is more
likely to dissipate via Γ2 than fed back to qubit 1 via g12 .
Fig. 10(c) and 10(d) show the spectrum when Γ2 = 4Γ1 .
In Fig. 10(c), when Γ2  g12 , there is only one qubit
peak (qubit 1), indicating that qubit 2 has effectively decoupled from the system. The spectrum reduces to that
of a JCM. However, when Γ2 < g12 , the dissipation of
qubit 2 does not dominate over the dipole interactions,
hence the qubit 2 peak is still observed. In Fig. 10(d),
g12 = Γ1 < Γ2 , thus qubit 2 effective decouples and the
spectrum resembles that of a JCM for all values of g1 .
Therefore, through suitable tuning of parameters, the
exchange-emission spectrum can be controlled. In particular, by controlling the Rabi splitting and the relative
positions of the qubit and cavity peaks, an ultranarrow
Fano peak can be achieved as shown in Fig. 10(a) with
g12 = 5Γ1 which is useful to the spectral filter effect.
As an example, we use a Gaussian input pulse to represent a Fourier-limited wave packet and a pure photonic
state [38], denoted by ψ(∆2 − ∆1 ). The input spectrum
is given by

where the pulse duration is √T = 2 3Γ−1
1 , which gives a
2 3
spectral linewidth ∆ω1 = T = Γ1 . The dipole-dipole

coupling is set as g12 = Γ1 and the qubit detuning ∆ω0 ≡
ω02 − ω01 = 0 as stated earlier. A small κ of 0.05Γ1 and
a cavity detuning of ∆c = ωc − ω01 = 2Γ1 will result in
a Fano resonant peak at ω2 = ωc .
In Fig. 11(a), when the excitation detuning ∆1 ≡ ω1 −
ω01 = 2Γ1 , the Gaussian peak (red dash-dotted curve)
and Fano peak (green dashed curve) are very near to
each other. Hence, the resulting SRaman (∆2 ) is similar
to the ultranarrow Fano peak. Increasing the excitation
detuning to ∆1 = 4Γ1 shifts the Gaussian peak away
from Fano peak. The resulting SRaman (∆2 ) is a product
of the input Gaussian and atomic Lorentzian as shown in
Fig. 11(b) which is not greatly affected by the exchangeemission spectrum of qubit 2. Hence, this system can
be used as a spectral filter where the input photon is
converted to a Stokes/anti-Stokes photon with a narrow
linewidth if the input pulse is tuned appropriately and if
the above conditions on κ and ∆c are met.
Thus, the characterisation and control of the emission
peaks of qubit 2 via the system parameters are important
in this spectral filter. For example, to utilise the filter
effectively and obtain a narrow output linewidth, the two
qubit peaks must be sufficiently far apart from the cavity
Fano peak. This can be achieved by increasing g12 and
setting κ  Γ1 , as we have done in Fig. 10.

CONCLUSION

Using the equation-of-motion method, we have explicitly calculated various transition probabilities in the time
domain involved in the spontaneous emission of qubit 1.
We found that the SE rate of the qubit can be significantly modified by engineering its electromagnetic environments, i.e. surrounding qubit 2 and/or cavity. The
Purcell enhancement and inhibition of qubit 1 are both
observed in the system. In general, when the decay rate
of qubit 1 dominates over the decay rates of surrounding
qubit/cavity elements, the SE rate of qubit 1 will be suppressed, or vice versa. Furthermore, a stronger suppression can be obtained by preparing the surrounding EMEs
in higher energetic state such that the survival probabil-

10
ity is greater than the free-space value with significantly
longer duration and suppressed Rabi oscillation. It is
exhibited that the best inhibition effect is obtained in
the two-qubit system with two excitations in strong coupling regime. The control of decay channel is also studied
by explicitly calculating the decay probabilities for each
channel. We find that different dominant decay channels
of qubit 1 can be realised by fine tuning the parameters
of system, i.e., decay rates and coupling rates. This finding may imply some potential applications in quantum
devices, such as the photonic switch and router.
In the frequency domain, by studying the Raman scattering spectrum of the TCM, we find that the system can
be utilised as a spectral filter. Since the spectrum of the
scattered photon is the product of the input pulse spectrum and the atomic response, if the Fano peak (from
qubit 2 emission spectrum) is near the input photon peak,
the scattering spectrum has a sharp peak around the cavity frequency, thus filtering out most of the non-resonant
frequencies from the input spectrum. The Fano peak
can be obtained by using large dipole coupling and set-

ting κ  Γ1 . The spectral filter effect is not limited to
the TCM discussed here and can be easily adapted for
other models and input pulse shapes.
In future works, instead of focusing on the two-level
system (qubit), we can explore the spontaneous emission in a driven multi-level system where the effects of
higher levels [42–44] and quantum interference [45, 46]
are usually important. Our study provides insights to
the control and characterisation of spontaneous emission
of qubits, which is key to quantum information processing and communication.
