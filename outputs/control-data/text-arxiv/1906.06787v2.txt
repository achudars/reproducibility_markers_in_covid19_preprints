ABSTRACT

Eclipsing time variations have been observed for a wide range of binary systems, including post-common-envelope binaries. A frequently proposed explanation, apart from the
possibility of having a third body, is the effect of magnetic activity, which may alter
the internal structure of the secondary star, particularly its quadrupole moment, and
thereby cause quasi-periodic oscillations. Here we present two compressible non-ideal
magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of the magnetic dynamo in a solar mass
star, one of them with three times the solar rotation rate (“slow rotator”), the other
one with twenty times the solar rotation rate (“rapid rotator”), to account for the high
rotational velocities in close binary systems. For the slow rotator, we find that both
the magnetic field and the stellar quadrupole moment change in a quasi-periodic manner, leading to O-C (observed - corrected times of the eclipse) variations of ∼ 0.025 s.
For the rapid rotator, the behavior of the magnetic field as well as the quadrupole
moment changes become considerably more complex, due to the less coherent dynamo
solution. The resulting O-C variations are of the order 0.13 s. The observed system
V471 Tau shows two modes of eclipsing time variations, with amplitudes of 151 s and
20 s, respectively. However, the current simulations may not capture all relevant effects due to the neglect of the centrifugal force and self-gravity. Considering the model
limitations and that the rotation of V471 Tau is still a factor of 2.5 faster than our
rapid rotator, it may be conceivable to reach the observed magnitudes.

INTRODUCTION

Post-common-envelope binaries (PCEBs) are close binaries
that consist of a low-mass main-sequence star and a white
dwarf (WD). Such systems are expected to form when the
more massive component evolves until its surface extends
beyond the outer Lagrangian point and eventually engulfs
its companion (Paczynski 1976). Then the less massive star
experiences friction and deposits orbital energy and angular
momentum into the common envelope (CE). It spirals inwards until the envelope is expelled due to the energy trans?

fer, leaving a close binary, typically consisting of an M dwarf
(dM) or a subdwarf and a white dwarf (see e.g., Parsons et al.
2013). The CE model has been revised and extended by various authors, including Meyer & Meyer-Hofmeister (1979);
Iben & Livio (1993); Taam & Sandquist (2000); Webbink
(2008) and Taam & Ricker (2010).
For about 90% of these systems, eclipsing time variations have been observed (e.g. Zorotovic & Schreiber 2013;
Bours et al. 2016). The variations occur on rather long
timescales of the order of 20 years or more. Two possible
interpretations of these variations are commonly discussed
in the literature: The first is the presence of a third body,
i.e. a planet or a brown dwarf, which would cause apparent

eclipsing time variations due to the light-travel time (LTT)
effect, i.e. the change in the light travel time to the observer
due to the change of distance as the PCEB rotates around
the common center of mass (e.g. Beuermann et al. 2010,
2013). Clearly, this effect requires rather massive planets
(> MJ , where MJ is the mass of Jupiter) on extended orbits (>AU) to produce significant variations. Alternatively,
such variations may also be produced through the Applegate mechanism (Applegate 1992), which will be described
in further detail below.
If the LTT is adopted, the eclipsing time variations imply the presence of two planets with masses of 5.6 MJ and
2.1 MJ and semi-major axis of 5 AU and 3.4 AU, respectively,
in the system NN Ser (Beuermann et al. 2010, 2013) which
often serves as a reference system for typical PCEBs. Beuermann et al. (2013) demonstrated the dynamical stability of
these orbits, which was independently confirmed by Horner
et al. (2012). However, when the additional data by Bours
et al. (2016) are considered, they require an extra quadratic
term in the expression for the eclispsing times if they want
to maintain the planet solution. The physical origin of such
an additional term is however unclear. In case of the system
HW Vir, a two-planet solution appears to be secularly stable
(Beuermann et al. 2012). A final conclusion on the stability
of orbits in Hu Aqr is still pending (Goździewski et al. 2012;
Hinse et al. 2012; Bours et al. 2014; Goździewski et al. 2015),
and similarly for QS Vir (Parsons et al. 2010b). In the case
of the system V471 Tau, the proposed third body has been
searched via Direct Imaging, but has not been found (Hardy
et al. 2015). Using the orbital period of the system (12.5-hr)
and the spin period (9.25-min) of the WD as two independent clocks, Vanderbosch et al. (2017) have concluded that
a third body interpretation cannot adequately explain the
nature of this system.
If the planets in NN Ser are real, they should also be
dynamically young, as the white dwarf has an age of only
106 yrs (Parsons et al. 2010a). While their existence is highly
speculative, they have at least two possible origins. The socalled first-generation scenario proposes that they formed
together with the binary and then survived the common envelope phase, while the second-generation scenario implies
that they formed through the material ejected during the
common envelope phase. A hybrid scenario may be also possible, with accretion of the ejected gas onto already existing
planets. Several studies have been carried out on this matter
(e.g., Völschow et al. 2014; Schleicher & Dreizler 2014; Bear
& Soker 2014), though it is currently difficult to draw any
final conclusions.
The other possible explanation of the eclipsing time
variations is magnetic activity. Historically, in particular the
Applegate mechanism (Applegate 1992) has been a relevant
scenario, in which the magnetic activity of the secondary
stars leads to a redistribution of the stellar angular momentum, thus changing its gravitational quadrupole moment.
This in turn produces a variation of the binary separation.
The original Applegate model has been improved by several
authors. For instance, Lanza & Rodonò (1999) improved the
model by adopting a consistent description of stellar virial
equilibrium. Brinkworth et al. (2006) extended the model introducing a finite shell formalism, considering the exchange
of the angular momentum between the shell and the core.
Völschow et al. (2016) examined their model in more de-

tailed and applied it to a sample of 16 close binary systems
(predominantly PCEBs), showing that the Applegate mechanism is a viable process in the shortest and most massive
binary systems. The corresponding model has been made
public through the Applegate calculator1 , and shows that
the mechanism is favored in particular for rapidly rotating
systems (Navarrete et al. 2018).
In addition to the finite shell model, Lanza & Rodonò
(2004) and Lanza (2005) presented a one-dimensional framework based on the angular momentum transport equations,
using simplifying assumptions of magneto-hydrodynamical
(MHD) turbulence and the mean magnetic field. We have
extended this framework in Völschow et al. (2018), considering in particular time-dependent hydrodynamic and magnetic fluctuations assuming a magnetic activity cycle, as well
as a superposition of different modes. For typical RS Canum
Venaticorum (RS CVn) systems, which are detached binaries typically composed of a chromospherically active G or K
star, the expected eclipsing time variations are however two
orders of magnitude lower than observed. The most promising Applegate candidates are post-common-envelope binaries with secondary masses of ∼ 0.35 M (Völschow et al.
2018), as these produce more energy through nuclear burning and can thus more easily redistribute angular momentum as required by the Applegate mechanism, while simultaneously not being critically affected by the presence of a
radiative core.
The presence of magnetic activity should be expected
in these systems due to the convective envelopes of the secondaries and their rapid rotation. A corresponding dynamo
model has been put forward by Rüdiger et al. (2002). Observationally, magnetic activity has been inferred on many
occasions. In the case of V471 Tau, it has been probed via
photometric variability, flaring events and Hα emission along
with a strong X-ray signal (Kamiński et al. 2007; Pandey &
Singh 2008). For DP Leo, magnetic activity has been revealed through X-ray observations (Schwope et al. 2002). In
the system QS Vir, it is indicated via detections of Ca II
emission and Doppler imaging (Ribeiro et al. 2010), as well
as observed coronal emission (Matranga et al. 2012). In case
of HR 1099, a 40 year X-ray light curve suggesting a longterm cycle was recently compiled by Perdelwitz et al. (2018),
and similar studies have been pursued via optical data (e.g.,
Donati et al. 2003; Lanza et al. 2006; Berdyugina & Henry
2007; Muneer et al. 2010).
While magnetic activity is potentially relevant to explain the origin of the eclipsing time variations, its effects
on the stellar structure so far have only been explored via
finite shell or 1D models, in both of which the presence of a
dynamo was externally imposed. However, a self-consistent
modeling of the dynamo and its interaction with the stellar structure may be crucial, and is only possible within 3D
magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) simulations. While stellar
dynamo models have previously been pursued (see e.g. Yadav et al. 2016), the latter was done in the anelastic limit,
which does not allow to explore the effect of the dynamo onto
the stellar structure. Here as a first step, we will employ a
fully compressible setup developed by Käpylä et al. (2013)

MHD origin of eclipsing time variations in post-common-envelope binaries
for a solar mass star although with rotation rates exceeding the solar one. These models allow the quantification of
changes in stellar structure due to the dynamo. While solar
mass stars are not very common in post-common-envelope
systems, they do occasionally occur, as for instance the secondary of V471 Tau has a mass of 0.93 ± 0.07 M (Zorotovic
& Schreiber 2013), and is thus still consistent with being a
solar mass star. Independently, we of course stress that this
is an exploratory study that should be extended to stars of
different masses as well.
In section 2, we will briefly introduce the Pencil Code2
(Brandenburg & Dobler 2002; Brandenburg 2003) as well as
the setup employed here, which is based on previous developments by Käpylä et al. (2013). In these simulations, the
Rayleigh number, which describes the ratio of the time scale
for thermal transport via diffusion to the time scale for thermal transport via convection, is however much smaller than
in reality due to the higher diffusivities required for numerical stability, see detailed discussions in Käpylä et al. (2013)
and Kupka & Muthsam (2017). Another caveat of fully compressible simulations of solar-like stars is that the low Mach
number in the deep parts of the convection zone necessitates a very short time step and that the thermal relaxation
occurs in the Kelvin–Helmholtz timescale which is of the order of 107 (105 ) years for the whole Sun (solar convection
zone) (see, e.g. Kupka & Muthsam 2017). Thus, to bring the
dynamic and acoustic timescales closer to each other and
to shorten the Kelvin–Helmholtz timescale, the energy flux
needs to be enhanced (see also Brandenburg et al. 2005).
To compensate for this and to obtain a comparable rotational influence on the flow as in real stars, which is the
key factor determining their dynamo properties, the angular velocity needs to be increased proportional to one third
power of the increase of the energy flux (see a detailed description in Käpylä et al. 2019). For this reason, the effect
of the centrifugal force has been omitted in this formulation
of the Navier-Stokes equation, as the resulting centrifugal
force would be too high, thereby significantly altering the
hydrostatic balance (Käpylä et al. 2011, 2013). With this in
mind, we note that our simulations present only a first step,
where the redistribution of material can be explored for instance due to meridional flows, and we will not probe the
effect originally proposed by Applegate (1992). Nevertheless,
the occurence of quadrupole moment variations even in the
absence of the centrifugal force term is a central outcome of
the simulations. The results of our simulations are presented
in section 3, including a hydrodynamical reference run and
two MHD simulations. Our discussion and conclusions are
presented in section 4.

Pencil Code

The Pencil code (Brandenburg & Dobler 2002; Brandenburg 2003) is a finite-difference code written in Fortran 95. It
uses sixth-order spatial derivatives and a third-order RungeKutta time integrator scheme, which makes the code particularly useful for studying weakly compressible turbulent
2

flows. For the timestepping, a high-order scheme is implemented in order to reduce amplitude errors and to allow
longer time steps, which is the RK-2N Runge-Kutta scheme
(Williamson 1980), where the “2N” stands for its memory
consumption of two chunks. The time step is specified by the
Courant time step. The Message passing interface (MPI) is
used for parallelization.
2.2

The model

The model we use here is based on those used by Cole et al.
(2014) and Viviani et al. (2018) and is described here for
completeness. The computational domain is spherical but
without the poles, which allows to reach a higher spatial resolution but at the cost of omitting connecting flows across
the poles and introducing artificial boundaries at high latitudes. The domain (r, θ, φ) denotes radial, colatitudinal, and
longitudinal directions. The radius extends from 0.7 R (the
bottom of the convection zone) to 1.0 R , where R is the
solar radius; θ goes from π/12 to 11π/12, and φ from 0 to
2π. The corresponding grid resolution is 128 × 256 × 512. We
employ the compressible non-ideal MHD equations in the
following form:

Ii j =
xi x j dm =
ρ(x)xi x j d 3 x,

Qi j = Ii j −

where xi refer to Cartesian coordinates.
As already mentioned in the introduction, the stellar
luminosity is enhanced due to numerical constraints (see
Brandenburg et al. 2005; Käpylä et al. 2019). As a result,
the energy flux coming from the bottom is much higher than
in the Sun. The ratio of fluxes Fr in the present case is
F
Fr = simulation = 8.07 · 105 .

(25)

The increased flux implies that the fluctuations of other
quantities are correspondingly enhanced. The fluctuation of
the pressure can be written as

∆ρ ≡ cs2 ∆ρ,

∆p =

where the subscript s indicates constant entropy and where
cs is the sound speed. Furthermore, variations in pressure

RESULTS

In this section, we present our main results obtained from
the numerical simulations. In subsection 3.1, we introduce
the notation used throughout the paper and discuss the overall properties of our simulations. We first discuss a pure
hydrodynamical reference run in subsection 3.2 to demonstrate that the long-term modulation of the quadrupole moment must have a magneto-hydrodynamical origin. We then
present two MHD models, a slow rotator (3 times solar rotation, Prot = 9 days) and a fast rotator (20 times solar
rotation, Prot = 1.4 days) in subsections 3.3 and 3.4. These
values were chosen as the rotation rate in PCEBs is considerably enhanced compared to isolated stars, with a rotation
period in V471 Tau of about 0.522 d (Zorotovic & Schreiber
2013).

Notation and General Properties

We label the two MHD simulations according to their rotation rates, namely run3x for the 3 times solar rotation, and
run20x for the 20 times solar rotation rate. Quantities with
an overline indicate an average over the azimuthal angle; e.g.
Br indicates an average of the r component of B over φ and
is given by
∫
Br (r, θ, φ) dφ
∫
Br (r, θ) =
.
(35)
dφ
Other averages are presented inside angular brackets with
sub- and superscripts. For example, hBr iik indicates an average of Br in regions denoted with i and k. The subscript
indicates the depth at which the quantity of interest is taken
and the superscript indicates the latitude where the average
is further calculated with the following rules:
i = {s, m, b},

(36)

k = {np, eq, sp},

s = surface → r = 0.98R,

Typical density and temperature profiles are shown in
Figure 1, corresponding to the final state of run20x. The
density at the bottom is 181.8 kg m−3 and 13.6 kg m−3 at the
surface, where bottom and surface are evaluated following
the definition in (38) and (40). This corresponds to a density

the temperature at the bottom of the CZ in the Sun, namely

at the surface.

is shown from six latitudes from run3x in the top panel of
Figure 2. Overall the rotation is faster at the equator than
at high latitudes, but we often observe an increase in the
angular velocity at the latitude boundaries (see the cyandotted lines in Fig. 2). This is likely an artefact due to the
impenetrable latitude boundary. In the lower panel of Figure 2, we show the time-averaged rotation profile for run20x.
The difference in the rotation rates between high latitudes
and the equator is significantly smaller than in the slower
rotator. The decrease of differential rotation as the overall
rotation rate is increased is consistent with earlier studies
(e.g. Viviani et al. 2018).
At the beginning, the simulations first have to go
through a relaxation phase during which thermal and magnetic saturation is established. The description that follows
corresponds to run20x, but is qualitatively the same for
run3x. There are two conditions that need to be fulfilled
before analyzing the results and deriving astrophysical implications for PCEB systems:
On the one hand, the system has to reach dynamo saturation, which is shown in Figure 3, where we plot the rootmean-squared magnetic field for run20x. The seed magnetic
field first decays because most of the initial magnetic en-

ergy is contained on the small scales which is quickly dissipated (Dobler et al. 2006). Furthermore, it takes susbtantial time for convection and large-scale flows to develop
that lead to dynamo action. Subsequently, the magnetic field
grows exponentially during the next three years during the
kinematic stage. This growth starts to slow down in the nonlinear regime until it reaches the saturation stage after about
22 years.
The system has to also reach thermal equilibrium, which
is shown in Figure 4, where we plot the fraction of thermal
to total energy. The only energy source in the simulations is
the energy injected from the bottom of the convection zone.
While most of this energy is transported to the surface by
convection, a fraction is deposited in the thermal reservoir of
the convection zone until equilibrium between energy input
and output is achieved. This is manifested by an increase of
the thermal energy in the present case. Thermal evolution
after roughly 8 years is slow and the system is sufficiently
close to thermal saturation to be used for statistical analysis
of the data.

Purely hydrodynamical simulation

Here we present a pure hydrodynamical reference run with
20 times solar rotation. This serves essentially for comparison with the MHD simulations, to demonstrate that longterm variations only occur in simulations that include magnetic fields.
Figure 5 shows the change of the gravitational
quadrupole moment Q xx in the dotted line, together with
the thermal energy as a fraction of the total energy of the
system as solid line. Here we can see very high frequency
oscillations with a period of 0.18 years. This is very close to
an average sound-crossing time τsc , which we calculate as
τsc =

The case of the slow rotator (run3x )

We first investigate the evolution of a simulation with three
times solar rotation. This case is characterised by Ta = 5.68×
107 , Co = 2.68, Re = Re M = 71, Pr M = 1, and PrSGS = 2.5.
Simulations with similar parameters were also explored by
Viviani et al. (2018) for the stellar dynamo but they have
not explored the implications on the stellar structure.
MNRAS 000, 1–16 (2015)

Overview of convective and magnetic states

To illustrate the general structure, we first examine a snapshot at the end of the simulation. Figure 6 shows a Mollweide
projection (an equal-area map projection also known as homolographic projection) of the near surface radial velocity.
The colorbar is cut at ±90 m s−1 to improve visualization.
The velocity field does not show clear signs of large-scale
structures. At the equator we see elongated cells (sometimes
called “banana cells”). Their existence is due to the influence
that rotation has on the flow (see Busse 1970). At higher
latitudes the the banana cells disappear, and the effect of
rotation is to give rise to more symmetric and smaller cells
(see, e.g. Chandrasekhar 1961). It should be noted that these
cells are much larger than those observed in the Sun which
is due to the much lower density stratification in the simulations. The mean radial velocity is ±60 m s−1 , while the
extrema can reach ±1000 m s−1 .
In Figure 7 we plot the near surface radial magnetic field
at the end of the simulation. The colorbar is cut at ±5 kG
to improve visualization. The magnetic field strength at the
equator is weaker than at high latitudes, and a clear m = 1
non-axisymmetric component is observed. The mean magnetic field strength is 2.5 kG and the extrema are ± 90 kG.
The sizes of the magnetic structures is much larger than, e.g.,
sunspots. This is due to the fact that the current simulations
lack the resolution to capture the small-scale granulation
near the surface and the physics leading to spot formation.

3.3.3

Origin of the quadrupole moment fluctuations

The time evolution of the diagonal elements of the
quadrupole moment Q xx , Q yy and Q zz is shown in Fig. 10.
While Q zz is positive, Q xx and Q yy are negative, and there is
a difference of about a factor of 2 in the components. Apart
from that, their overall behavior is very similar, showing a
quasi-periodic evolution with a period of around 8 years, and
an amplitude of the order of ∼ 1 × 1039 kg m2 in the case
of Q xx . For comparison, we also applied the semi-analytic
model by Völschow et al. (2018), obtaining the same order of magnitude for the fluctuations. The system further
shows the presence of short-term oscillations, which are also
present in hydrodynamical runs (see Sect. 3.2). We will in
the following take the Q xx component as a reference that we
compare to other quantities, keeping in mind that the result
would be similar for the other components as well.
We compare the evolution with the average radial mag-

We start the analysis by examining the dynamo solution of
the slow rotator. Figure 8 shows the evolution of the mean
toroidal magnetic field (butterfly diagram) of run3x at three
depths. At the northern hemisphere there is an overall positive polarity whereas in the southern hemisphere the dominant polarity is negative. In each panel, the polarity near
the latitude boundaries is opposite to the dominant polarity. Polarity reversals can be seen at high latitudes at the
bottom of the convective region (third panel). In the middle
(second panel), these reversals at the poles are more pronounced and thus easier to see whereas at the surface the
reversals are not as clearly observed in the azimuthal field.
Thus it appears that the axisymmetric part of the magnetic
field consists of a dominant quasi-stationary component and
a weaker quasi-periodic one, as also recently reported by Viviani et al. (2019). Meanwhile, the strength of the azimuthal
magnetic field is varying quasi-periodically without polarity
reversals near the equator. At the three reference depths
there are episodes of decreased activity, for example at the
equator during the time frames of 55 to 59 years and 62 to
66 years. The extrema at the bottom, middle, and surface
are ± 20 kG, ± 7 kG, and ± 3 kG, respectively.
The evolution of the radial field is shown in Figure
9. At the bottom of the convective zone (bottom panel)
the behaviour of Br is similar to the one described for
the toroidal field at the surface. At low latitudes and towards the equator the magnetic field is positive (negative)
at the northern (southern) hemisphere, and there are no
clear signs of polarity reversals. In the middle of the convective region we start seeing hints of a poleward migrating dynamo wave (see second panel in Figure 9) at latitudes greater than 50◦ in both hemispheres. Meanwhile, at
mid-latitudes (±30◦ ) a persistently negative (positive) magnetic field in the northern (southern) hemisphere is obtained
with no migration. Near the equator, the mean radial magnetic field is weaker but with periods of increased strength
at t = 39, 43, 55, 51, and, 67 years. At the surface of the star
(top panel) a dynamo wave is obtained with a poleward migration. At the equator the strength of Br is weaker with
periods of increased strength at the same times as in the
middle of the computational domain.

and how they relate to the quadrupole moment. The first
peak of the magnetic field at t = 40 years can be related to
the minimum of Q xx at t = 41.7 years. Then, the continuous
increase in the magnetic field intensity from t = 45 years
to t = 50 years is reflected in a decrease of Q xx starting at
the 45 years mark to t = 51 years. This shows the direct
impact of magnetic field to the overall density distribution
of the star. We also compare the evolution of Q xx directly
with the evolution of the total and axisymmetric magnetic
energies in Figure 12 top and bottom panels. Here we see a

close anticorrelation between the magnetic energy and Q xx
in both panels, and a time lag might also be present.
Now, we explore the correlation between the Reynolds
stress tensor component Rrφ = ur0 uφ0 , where primes denote
fluctuations from azimuthal averages which are denoted by
overbars, which is known to drive differential rotation (Rüdiger 1989; Käpylä et al. 2016). This is shown in Figure 13.
The stress at the surface (middle) of the computational domain is correlated (anticorrelated) with the quadrupole moment. The stress at the bottom is weak and with a small
contribution and weak correlation to Q xx .
Finally, we study how the angular momentum Lz =
ρ$ 2 Ω, where $ = r sin θ is related to Q xx . In Figure 14,
we plot the angular momentum per unit volume averaged
over the northern hemisphere at the surface (red), middle
(green), and bottom (blue). While the angular momentum
itself will not directly affect the stellar structure through
the centrifugal force, it changes due to the Reynolds stress
and shows a strong correlation here with the change of the
quadrupole moment.
From this figure we see that the outer layers carry less
angular momentum than the inner ones, and at the surface
there is an anti-correlation between the absolute value of

a reaction to the changes of the magnetic field intensity (see text).

Gravitational quadrupole moment evolution

We return to Figure 10 to analyze the time evolution of
quadrupole moment. We are interested in variations on
timescales longer than the hydrodynamic oscillations with a
period of ∼0.18 years, see Section 3.2. The variations in Q xx
are not strictly periodic. For example, there is an episode
between t ∼ 44 yr to t ∼ 52 yr where it takes clearly more
time to reach a local maximum. Furthermore, Q xx reaches
a global minimum at t = 65 yr which is clearly lower than

those that precede it. This behaviour is to be expected to a
certain degree as the full set of MHD equations is highly nonlinear. Overall, these fluctuations have a period of ∼ 5 . . . 6
years and semi-amplitudes of ∼ 1 × 1039 kg m2 .
Bearing in mind the necessary rescaling to obtain astrophysical values (see section 2.4) and that we are modeling a
solar mass star, we can use the results from our simulations
to estimate the impact in V471 Tau. Following Applegate
(1992), the variations in the binary period are related to
variations in the quadrupole moment via

where M and R are the mass and radius of the magnetically

and adopt a binary separation of 3.3 R . This result is consistent with the semi-analytic model by Völschow et al. (2018),
adopting fluctuations of about 10% in the turbulence and

case is thus much lower than observed. However, we note
that the rotation rate is different than in V471 Tau, and
also the stellar mass may not be exactly the same. Indeed,
more promising results will be obtained with the fast rotator
in the next section.
3.4

The case of the fast rotator (run20x )

We now investigate the evolution of a simulation with twenty
times solar rotation. This case is characterised by Ta = 2.55×
109 , Co = 59.7, Re = Re M = 21, Pr M = 1, and PrSGS =
2.5. Also this simulation lies within the parameter regime
explored by Viviani et al. (2018).
3.4.1

Overview of convective and magnetic states

Figure 15 shows the near-surface radial velocity from run20x.
Also here, banana cells here are present at the equator, but
with a decreased azimuthal extent in comparison to run3x.
At higher latitudes the size of the convection cells is also
reduced. This decreasing size of convection cells as the rotation increases is in accordance with linear stability analysis
(e.g. Chandrasekhar 1961) and earlier numerical simulations
(e.g. Viviani et al. 2018). The average convective velocity is
19.4 m s−1 , with extrema of 700 m s−1 and −561 m s−1 .
Figure 16 shows the near-surface radial magnetic field
at the end of run20x. The radial magnetic field differs from
that of run3x in that it is stronger and more organized. The
rms radial magnetic field is 4.5 kG, i.e. 1.8 times stronger
than in run3x. The extrema are about ± 90 kG, as in run3x.
These large-scale magnetic structures can cover the whole
surface of the star. A possible explanation is that convection
in the rapidly rotating run is less supercritical in terms of its
Rayleigh number because the values of ν and χSGS remain
the same as in run3x. Thus the flows and magnetic fields in
run20x are more laminar than in run3x.
3.4.2

Overview of the magnetic field evolution

We follow here the same approach as in the case of the
slow rotator. Figure 17 shows the time evolution of the
mean toroidal magnetic field, i.e. butterfly diagram, at three
depths labeled at the lower left corner of each panel. The
mean magnetic field shows a more complex behavior than
in run3x. At the bottom of the domain the dynamo solution

is cyclic everywhere in the beginning. The maximum amplitudes are ±12 kG. At later times there is a quasi-stationary
axisymmetric magnetic field from 57 years to 76 years, covering most of the southern hemisphere. The dynamo solution
at the middle of the domain is persistently cyclic with a poleward migration. Here the extrema of the magnetic field are
±8 kG. At the surface there is a poleward dynamo wave near
the equator with extrema of ±5 kG. This poleward mode is
clearly more coherent on the northern hemisphere and can
be seen at latitudes between ∼ 5◦ to ∼ 50◦ , whereas a higher
frequency wave on the southern hemisphere can be seen only
very near the equator. The amplitude of the axisymmetric
magnetic field is also slowly decreasing during the simulation. The absence of a strong toroidal magnetic field near
the surface is due to the radial field boundary condition (see
Käpylä et al. 2016; Warnecke et al. 2016).
A time-latitude diagram for Br is shown in Figure 18.
Here, the presence of a hemispheric dynamo wave with decreasing amplitude in time is clearly visible and the magnetic
fields have a poleward migration. At early times, the extrema

at the surface (bottom) is ±20 kG (±8 kG). The hemispheric
asymmetry disappears in the period between 68 to 80 years
and the extrema near the top (bottom) is ±4 kG (±3 kG),
respectively. The behaviour is quite different from the case
of run3x. This is because the excited dynamo mode depends
on the rotation rate of the simulation (see e.g. Viviani et al.
2018). The major differences in the magnetic field evolution
between run3x and run20x is that first, the intensity of Br
in the latter is larger by a factor of 2 at the surface. Second,
the overall intensity of the azimuthally averaged magnetic
field in the latter is decaying, whereas in run3x it remains
roughly constant. And third, the magnetic field is migrating virtually everywhere in run20x, whereas the migrating
component was found to be subdominant in run3x where a
strong quasi-steady field is present at all times (see Figure
9). We note in summary that the behaviour of the magnetic
field is considerably more complex in the rapidly rotating
case.

3.4.3

Origin of the Q xx fluctuations

Analogously to the slowly rotating case, we explore the origin of the quadrupole moment variations. The time evolution of the diagonal elements Q xx , Q yy , and Q zz are shown in
Figure 19 but we again study Q xx bearing in mind that the
result would be similar for the other components. In |Q xx |,
we see a quasi-periodic variation on a timescale of about
30 years superimposed with a longer-term trend. The latter, which decreases continuously the quadrupole moment,
might be related to an incomplete thermal saturation of the
stellar interior. For this reason we have de-trended Q xx by
taking the difference between the endpoints of its time series and substracting this linear trend from the data. The
resulting time series is shown in Fig. 20. We first compare
the total, non-de-trended Q xx to the evolution of the mean
radial magnetic field averaged at the northern hemisphere
at the surface of the domain, depicted in Figure 21. The
np
sharp decrease of hBr is reflects the change in the dominant

dynamo mode (same as in Figure 18). The effect of this decrease on Q xx can also be clearly seen.
This correlation is not seen when the same quantities
are compared on the southern hemisphere (see middle panel
of Figure 21). It can also be seen that the mean magnetic
field is weaker by almost an order of magnitude in the southern hemisphere around t = 32 yr. The mean field strengths
evolve gradually such that they are equal around t = 70 yr.
The mean fields at both hemispheres start to grow around
the 80 year mark; see top panel of Figure 21) which coincides with the weak increase in Q xx . Finally, it can be seen
from the bottom panel of Figure 21 that the average magnetic field at the equatorial portion of the surface of the
star does not have significant variations nor correlation with
Q xx . We further compare the evolution of the de-trended
Q xx with the total magnetic and the azimuthal magnetic
energy in Figure 22. Here, especially for the azimuthal magnetic energy, the anticorrelation is less pronounced than we
previously found in run run3x. In the total magnetic energy, several maxima or minima show counterparts in the
evolution of Q xx but only toward the end of the simulation,
i.e. t & 65 yr. Further, while Q xx on average is decreasing
during the period investigated here, the total magnetic energy shows an average increase. The azimuthal magnetic energy, on the other hand, shows a strong peak towards the beginning of the simulated period, and subsequently remains at
a lower level with quasi-periodic fluctuations on a timescale
of roughly 5 years in superposition with a possible longer
term modulation.
As for run3x, we plot the r φ component of the Reynolds
stress at the equator and at the three depths in Figure 23.
The average of Rr φ at the surface is steadily increasing while
Q xx decreases. Meanwhile, the stress at the deeper layers is
approximately constant. There is anti-correlation between
Q xx and the stress at the equator near the surface in the
latter part (t & 60 yr) of the simulation. We also show the
correlation between the quadrupole moment and the angular momentum at three depths in Figure 24, though we note
as before that this correlation is due to the effect of angular
momentum redistribution by the Reynolds tensor, and unrelated to the centrifugal acceleration. While at early times
Lz at the bottom increases and Q xx remains constant, the
correlation in both quantities after the 40 years mark is high.

Gravitational quadrupole moment evolution

The purely hydrodynamic oscillations in the quadrupole moments, particularly Q xx (see also Sect. 3.2) are present, similarly as in run3x. The overall behaviour of the quadrupole
moment in this run is remarkably different from the case
of run3x, showing a more complex behaviour. At the beginning from the 29 to 37 year marks Q xx remains constant
on average, apart from the presence of hydrodynamic oscillations with a period of ∼0.18 years. After the 37 years
mark, Q xx decreases gradually from −1.15 × 1041 kg m2
to −1.16 × 1041 kg m2 . After this, the behavior described
above starts again but now the decrease is stronger and
starts at 60 years. Q xx changes from −1.17 × 1041 kg m2
to −1.18 × 1041 kg m2 . It is thus possible that we see here a
quasi-periodic oscillation superimposed with a longer term
trend. Analogously to the case of run3x where we rescaled
the gravitational quadrupole moment (see section 2.4), we
take the system parameters of the magnetically active component in the PCEB V471 Tau and bear in mind that this
run has a rotation rate and stellar parameters similar to the
magnetically active star in this system, but now we take the
maximum and minimum of Q xx to obtain

To recapitulate, we find that the evolution of the fast rotator
is much more complex in comparison to the more slowly rotating counterpart and clear correlations between magnetic
activity and quadrupole moment variations are visible only
toward the end of the simulation. A significantly longer time
series would be needed to quantify this effect more precisely.
This is out of the scope of the current study and will be pursued elsewhere.

The semi-amplitude obtained from the simulations is still
lower than the observed value found by Marchioni et al.
(2018). Nevertheless, we also found that it has increased
considerably compared to the slow rotator, by a factor of
5.2, while the rotation velocity has changed by roughly a

factor of 6.7. As we are still a factor of 2.5 below the rotation velocity of V471 Tau, it is conceivable that another
significant increase could be expected for the parameters of
that system. In addition, we note that the centrifugal force is
neglected in our simulations, which can be another relevant
contribution.

has been neglected so far, but it may further enhance the
O-C variations. The current simulations also assume a fixed
spherically symmetric gravitational potential. This modeling choice is possibly also limiting the quadrupole moment
variations.
Overall, we arrive at the following preliminary conclusions:

4

(i) the complexity of the evolution of Q xx is linked to the
dynamo mode, angular momentum evolution, and Reynolds
stress tensor,
(ii) Q xx is anticorrelated to the total and axisymmetric
magnetic energies,
(iii) the numbers of the O−C amplitude and ∆P/P depend
on the overall magnetic field evolution and complexity,
(iv) the angular momentum at the bottom of the convection zone is more correlated to Q xx than that near the
surface,
(v) ∆Q xx has a dependence on stellar rotation.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we have studied the stellar quadrupole moment variations arising from magnetic activity through directly solving the 3D compressible non-ideal MHD equations
with the Pencil Code. We have run two simulations of solar mass stars, one with three times the solar rotation rate,
and the other with 20 times solar rotation. This is motivated
by the fact that typical rotation rates in PCEBs are considerably higher than for isolated stars. As a reference system,
we here consider V471 Tau, which has a roughly solar mass
secondary.
In the two simulations we have run, we see two very
different behaviours in the evolution of the magnetic fields
and the quadrupole moment. For the slow rotator, quasiperiodic oscillations in the quadrupole moment, the magnetic field, the Reynolds stress and other quantities can be
distinguished easily. Meanwhile, for the fast rotator the evolution is much more complex, which can also be seen in the
magnetic field evolution. The slow rotator has a relatively
simple magnetic field behaviour, showing a superposition
of a strong quasi-steady and a weaker migrating dynamo
modes, whereas the fast rotator has a significantly more
complex magnetic field evolution. It has a poleward migrating magnetic field near the equator and a superposed hemispheric dynamo wave operating only on the northern hemisphere. The latter is also decreasing its amplitude. While
the run has been evolved for a total of 90 years, it may not
yet be in complete thermal saturation, which can give rise
to the long-term trends that we observed. We therefore have
de-trended the simulations to correct for such an influence,
yielding then a clear anti-correlation with magnetic energy.
We have established a link between the magnetic activity and the gravitational quadrupole moment by means
of the Reynolds stress tensor, which will be affected by the
magnetic dynamo due to its local effect on the convective
velocities. There is an anticorrelation between both the total and axisymmetric magnetic energies and Q xx , but we
do not discard a time lag of the anticorrelation. While in
the case of the slow rotator it is relatively easy to observe,
in the fast rotator case the behaviour is much more complex, as it shows signs of a quasi-periodic change, on which
a global trend appears to be superimposed both for the magnetic field and the quadrupole moment. The time line in our
simulations (∼ 55 years) is larger than the observed timeline in V471 Tau, while the observed timeline corresponds
to about 35 years. The expected O-C variation has increased
considerably going from the slow to the fast rotator, where a
change by half an order of magnitude in the rotation velocity
corresponds to a change by a factor of 5.2 in the expected
value of O-C. As even the fast rotator is a factor of 2.5 below the rotation velocity of V471 Tau, another significant
increase may be expected for the rotation velocity of that
system. We also note that the effect of the centrifugal force

In spite of relevant uncertainties to be explored, we
present here the first analysis showing how the stellar
quadrupole moment changes as a function of time in compressible non-ideal MHD simulations. We find strong evidence that magnetic effects can indeed produce such variations, while pure hydrodynamical runs as presented in section 3.2 produce only short-term variations on the soundcrossing timescale. We believe that such simulations will be
important in the future to more quantitatively explore the
effects of magnetic activity in close binary systems, and to
allow a better understanding of the observed phenomena.
The variations in Q xx found here should be taken as
indicative rather than precise, as with the current computational power it is impossible to approach the real dimensionless parameters that govern stellar plasmas. For example, the magnetic Prandtl number is 1 in the simulations
whereas in the Sun it is ∼ 10−5 . The normalized flux in the
bottom of the Sun is ∼ 10−11 whereas in the simulation it
is highly enhanced with a value of 3.2 × 10−5 . In the case
of the Reynolds number this is more severe, as in the Sun
it ranges from 1012 to 1013 and in the simulations we have
Re ∼ 21 − 71. However, the simulations in previous studies
have proven to be successful in reproducing some of the solar
phenomena (see e.g. Viviani et al. 2018; Käpylä et al. 2016,
2013, 2012). Further development of 3D MHD simulations
of fully-convective stars will prove to be of great importance
as we expect the Applegate mechanism to be an important
tool for studying M dwarfs dynamos through eclipsing time
variations.
To draw stronger conclusions, more simulations are required to explore the parameter space. In particular, exploring how Q xx depends on stellar rotation and mass is
important as the magnetically active companion in PCEBs
is rotating at a high fraction of their critical stellar rotation,
which scales with the energetical feasibility of the Applegate
mechanism (Navarrete et al. 2018). Also, fully-convective
stars are expected to produce a higher amplitude of ∆P/P
based on the models of Völschow et al. (2018). Based on
such simulations, eclipsing time observations may become a
promising tool to probe stellar dynamos in the future.
