Heat conduction in dielectric crystals originates from the propagation of atomic vibrations, whose
microscopic dynamics is well described by the linearized phonon Boltzmann transport equation.
Recently, it was shown that thermal conductivity can be resolved exactly and in a closed form as a
sum over relaxons, i.e. collective phonon excitations that are the eigenvectors of Boltzmann equation’s scattering matrix [Cepellotti and Marzari, Phys. Rev. X 6, 041013 (2016)]. Relaxons have
a well-defined parity, and only odd relaxons contribute to the thermal conductivity. Here, we show
that the complementary set of even relaxons determines another quantity — the thermal viscosity
— that enters into the description of heat transport, and is especially relevant in the hydrodynamic
regime, where dissipation of crystal momentum by Umklapp scattering phases out. We also show
how the thermal conductivity and viscosity parametrize two novel viscous heat equations — two
coupled equations for the temperature and drift-velocity fields — which represent the thermal counterpart of the Navier-Stokes equations of hydrodynamics in the linear, laminar regime. These viscous
heat equations are derived from a coarse-graining of the linearized Boltzmann transport equation for
phonons, and encompass both limits of Fourier’s law and of second sound, taking place, respectively,
in the regimes of strong or weak momentum dissipation. Last, we introduce the Fourier deviation
number as a descriptor that captures the deviations from Fourier’s law due to hydrodynamic effects.
We showcase these findings in a test case of a complex-shaped device made of graphite, obtaining
a remarkable agreement with the very recent experimental demonstration of hydrodynamic transport in this material. The present findings also suggest that hydrodynamic behavior can appear
at room temperature in micrometer-sized diamond crystals. The present formulation rigorously
generalizes Fourier’s heat equation, extending the reach of physical and computational models for
heat conduction also to the hydrodynamic regime.

INTRODUCTION

Thermal transport in insulating crystals takes place
through the evolution and dynamics of the vibrations of
atoms around their equilibrium positions. The first predictive theoretical framework to describe thermal transport was developed by Peierls in 1929 [1–3], who envisioned a microscopic theory in terms of a Boltzmann
transport equation (BTE) for the propagation of vibrational excitations (phonon wavepackets). In the 1960s
significant progress took place in this field, propelled
by newly discovered hydrodynamic phenomena in crystals, with striking signatures such as Poiseuille-like heat
flow [4] and second sound [5]. The former manifests itself with a heat flux that is akin to the flow of a fluid
in a pipe (i.e. showing a parabolic-like profile with a
maximum in the center and minimum at the boundaries, due to viscous effects); the latter instead results
in heat propagation in the form of a coherent temperature wave, rather than a diffusing heat front. Second
sound has been observed experimentally in a handful of
solids; first, in solid helium [5], followed by sodium fluoride [6, 7], bismuth [8], sapphire [9], and strontium titanate [10, 11] – all at cryogenic conditions. Importantly,

neither Poiseuille flow nor second sound can be described
by the macroscopic Fourier’s equation, which is limited
to a diffusive description of heat propagation.
These experimental observations have been accompanied by several pioneering efforts aimed at providing a quantitative description of heat hydrodynamics
at the mesoscopic level, i.e. in terms of partial differential equations (PDEs) that are simpler than the microscopic integro-differential BTE (we use “mesoscopic
model” to denote any description requiring more fields
or PDEs than the Fourier’s PDE for the temperature
field [12]). Sussmann and Thellung [13], starting from
the linearized BTE (LBTE) in the absence of momentumdissipating (Umklapp) phonon-phonon scattering events,
derived mesoscopic equations in terms of the temperature and of the phonon drift velocity, i.e. the thermal counterparts of pressure and fluid velocity in liquids. Further advances came from Gurzhi [14, 15] and
Guyer & Krumhansl [16, 17] who, including the effect
of weak crystal momentum dissipation, obtained equations for damped second sound and for Poiseuille heat
flow. Among early works, we also mention the discussions of phonon hydrodynamics in the framework of
many-body theory, as in Refs. [18, 19]. While correctly capturing the qualitative features of phonon hydrodynamics, all the theoretical investigations mentioned
above assume simplified phonon dispersion relations (either power-law [14, 15] or linear isotropic [13, 16, 17]),

2
or neglect momentum dissipation [13]. A more rigorous
and general formulation — albeit valid only in the hydrodynamic regime of weak Umklapp scattering — was
introduced by Hardy, who extended the study of second
sound [20] and, together with Albers, of Poiseuille flow
in terms of mesoscopic transport equations [21].
The turn of the century brought renewed interest in
the theory of heat conduction; computational and algorithmic advances now allow to solve exactly the LBTE
— employing iterative [22–24], variational [25], or exact diagonalization [26, 27] methods — and thus investigate the accuracy of the LBTE and the models derived
from it. In addition, nowadays it is possible to solve
the LBTE without any fitting parameter, deriving all
quantities from first-principles; this has been shown to
describe accurately the thermal properties of bulk crystals [23, 28–37], provided phonon branches remain wellseparated [38].
Further applications of the LBTE, combined with
state-of-the-art first-principles simulations, have also recently predicted the existence of hydrodynamic phenomena at non-cryogenic temperatures in low-dimensional or
layered materials such as graphene [31, 39, 40], other 2D
materials [31], carbon nanotubes [41] and graphite [42].
Fittingly, and remarkably, these theoretical suggestions
have now been confirmed by the experimental finding of
second sound in graphite [43] at ∼ 100 K.
In the hydrodynamic regime, where Poiseuille flow or
second sound occur, Fourier’s law fails [43–46], depriving
us of the most common tool used to predict the temperature profile in a device. The LBTE, in principle, allows
to predict accurately thermal transport under these conditions, but its complexity prevents a straightforward application to materials with complex geometries (used in
experiments and relevant for applications), thus posing
limitations to the study of how a material’s shape alters
transport [35]. Recent research efforts have been directed
at developing mesoscopic models that correct the shortcomings of Fourier’s law and extend it at a lower computational cost than the solution of the full LBTE. Different strategies have been suggested; some approaches
reduce the complexity of the LBTE by neglecting the effects of the phonon modes repopulation due to scattering
events (the so-called single-mode relaxation-time approximation (SMA)), thus allowing for analytical [47–50] or
asymptotic [51] solutions. From the LBTE in the SMA,
mesoscopic models that generalize Fourier’s law accounting for ultrafast thermal processes or ballistic effects have
been derived [52–56]. Other works have derived mesoscopic models without relying on the LBTE [57], or have
generalized the Guyer-Krumhansl equation to account
for the effect of the boundaries on the heat flow [58–
62]. A hydrodynamic transport model has been derived
from the LBTE in the Callaway approximation, defining
a phonon viscosity which can be computed from atomistic data [63].
Here, we provide a general and universal solution to
the challenge of extending Fourier’s law all the way to

the hydrodynamic regime, deriving from the LBTE two
novel coupled mesoscopic heat transport equations that
cover exactly and on equal footing Fourier diffusion, hydrodynamic propagation, and all regimes in between.
To this aim, we first show that one can define the thermal viscosity of a crystal starting from an exact solution
of the LBTE in terms of the eigenvectors of the scattering matrix (i.e. the relaxons introduced in Ref. [27]
to determine thermal conductivity), and evaluate from
it the crystal-momentum flux generated in response to
a drift-velocity gradient. The relaxons’ parity [27] highlights the complementary character of thermal conductivity and viscosity, with the former being determined
by odd relaxons, and the latter by even relaxons.
Next, we use a coarse-graining procedure to derive two
novel “viscous” heat equations: these are two coupled
equations for the local temperature and drift-velocity
fields, and are parametrized in terms of the thermal conductivity and viscosity. The viscous heat equations represent the thermal counterpart of the Navier-Stokes equations for fluids in the laminar regime, and, as mentioned,
include Fourier’s law and second sound in the limits of
strong and weak crystal momentum dissipation, respectively.
Last, we introduce the Fourier deviation number
(FDN), a dimensionless parameter that quantifies the deviation from Fourier’s law due to hydrodynamic effects.
We test this formalism on graphite, diamond and silicon, showing that the FDN predicts a temperature and
size for the window of hydrodynamic thermal transport
that replicates the explicit solution of the viscous heat
equations, but at a negligible computational cost. Most
importantly, the prediction of the present formulation
for the hydrodynamic window of graphite is found to
be in excellent agreement with recent, pioneering experiments [43]. In passing, we also predict that hydrodynamic behavior can appear in diamond at room temperature for micrometer-sized crystals.

THERMAL VISCOSITY

A microscopic description of thermal transport is given
by the LBTE:
∂nν (r, t)
1 X

Ωνν 0 nν (r, t) , (1)
∂t

where ν labels a phonon state (i.e. an index running on
all the phonon wavevectors q and phonon branches s), vν
is the phonon group velocity, V is the crystal volume [64],
and Ωνν 0 is the phonon-phonon scattering matrix [27].
Eq. (1) governs the evolution of the deviation nν (r, t) of
the phonon populations from equilibrium:
nν (r, t) = Nν (r, t) − N̄ν ,

(2)

where Nν (r, t) are the out-of-equilibrium phonon populations at position r and time t, N̄ν = (e~ων /(kB T̄ ) − 1)−1

3
is the equilibrium Bose-Einstein distribution at temperature T̄ , and ων are the phonon frequencies. From the
solution of the LBTE
P one can derive the local lattice
energy E(r, t)= V1 ν ~ων Nν (r, t) and the total crystal
P
momentum P (r, t)= V1 ν ~qNν (r, t) [20]. The former
is often studied in connection with the thermal conductivity [27], while the latter becomes relevant in the hydrodynamic regime of thermal transport [13, 15, 65]. We
note in passing that this latter emerges only in “simple”
crystals, i.e. those where phonon interbranch spacings
are much larger than their linewidths [38].
The energy flux generated in response to a temperature gradient determines the thermal conductivity; correspondingly, the crystal-momentum flux generated in response to a perturbation of the drift velocity determines
the thermal viscosity (for the electronic analogous, see
Ref. [66]). Therefore, we start by considering a crystal
in the hydrodynamic regime of thermal transport (i.e.
carrying a finite amount of crystal momentum); under
the constraint of fixed total energy and crystal momentum, the local equilibrium is given by the phonon drifting
distribution NνD (T (r, t), u(r, t)) [15]
NνD (T (r, t), u(r, t)) =

. (3)
e
−1
The drifting distribution differs from the Bose-Einstein
distribution due to the presence of a drift velocity u (a
parameter expressing the amount of local momentum,
just as the temperature does for the local energy); it depends implicitly on r, t through T (r, t) and u(r, t). Next,
we study the effect of small perturbations in the temperature and drift velocity. To this aim, we expand the
out-of-equilibrium drifting distribution (2) in proximity
of the local thermal equilibrium [20], finding
nν (r, t) =

where nTν arises from the change in the local temperaδ
ture [67], nD
ν from the local drift velocity, and nν accounts
for all the information that cannot be mapped to a local
equilibrium state; the derivatives are computed at equilibrium where T (r, t) = T̄ and u(r, t) = 0. In analogy
with previous work [25, 27], we consider the steady-state
case and linearize the LBTE around the constant temperature and drift-velocity gradients (i.e. nδν , ∇T , and ∇u
are constant). Then, we substitute Eq. (4) in Eq. (1)
and, keeping only terms linear in the temperature and
drift-velocity gradients, we obtain

ñν (r, t) = nν (r, t)[N̄ν (N̄ν + 1)]− 2 with the goal of using
the relaxon picture [27] to gain insight in the physics underlying transport. We then simplify the symmetrized
Eq. (5) exploiting parity: we recall that a function fν
is even if fν = f−ν (this is e.g. the case of the phonon
energy ~ων = ~ω−ν ), and odd if fν = −f−ν (e.g. the
phonon group velocity vν = −v−ν ), and use the notaN̄ν
tion −ν = (−q, s). Therefore, ∂∂T
and thus ñTν (r, t) are

even, whereas ∂uν and thus ñD
ν (r, t) are odd.
Since the eigenvectors of the scattering matrix have a

separating the even (ñν ) and odd (ñν ) components. At

the uniform drift-velocity gradient is a special spaceindependent case of this local relationship. Eq. (7) has
the same mathematical form of the steady-state LBTE
linearized in the temperature gradient and used to compute the thermal conductivity. Therefore, we can readily
solve it applying the methodology introduced in Ref. [27],
and based on the eigenvectors of the scattering matrix
(relaxons), to find a closed expression for ñδE
ν . Combining such solution with Eq. (8) we find, after symmetrizing, the following expression for the symmetrized thermal

are three special eigenvectors linked to the crystal momentum of the system; to see this, we first decompose

the scattering matrix as Ω̃νν 0 = Ω̃N
νν 0 + Ω̃νν 0 , where Ω̃νν 0
U
and Ω̃νν 0 contain only momentum-conserving (normal)
and momentum-dissipating (Umklapp) processes, respectively. Since the normal part of the scattering matrix
conserves crystal momentum, there exists a set of 3 eigenvectors φiν (i = 1, . . . , 3 where 3 is the dimensionality of
the system) with zero eigenvalue for Ω̃N
νν 0 , which are associated to the conservation of crystal momentum in the
3 Cartesian directions. Because the viscosity describes
the response of the crystal momentum flux to a change
of drift velocity, it is not surprising that the eigenvectors
φiν appear in its definition. In fact, the local equilibrium
distribution (Eq. (3)) is linear in the drift velocity, with
the proportionality coefficients being these special eigenvectors (see Appendix A for a proof), and therefore they
appear in the viscosity as well, to describe a perturbation to this local equilibrium. We note in passing that the
thermal viscosity defined in Eq. (9) has the dimensions
of a dynamic viscosity (Pa·s) and satisfies the property
µijkl = µilkj = µkjil .
We report in Fig. 1 the first-principles estimates of the
thermal viscosity for graphite, diamond, and silicon. We
choose these three materials as prototypes for two different behaviors, the former two displaying hydrodynamic
thermal transport [25, 42, 43, 45, 69, 70], as opposed to
the more conventional case of silicon [25, 27]. We account for finite-size effects by combining the bulk viscosity in Eq. (9) with its ballistic limit via Matthiessen’s
rule for a sample having size (or grain size) of 10 µm;
the same renormalization is applied also to the thermal
conductivity (see Appendix C for details).
This is
an approximate treatment of surface scattering effects,
which provides an estimate of size effects at a much
lower computational complexity compared to more refined models [69, 71]. In general, when samples’ sizes
become comparable or smaller than the carriers’ diffusion lengths [61, 72–76], transport coefficients cannot be
rigorously defined and a more accurate treatment is required, solving the much more complex and computationally expensive space-dependent LBTE [24, 35, 47, 77].
Matthiessen’s approach is a good approximation when
the values of thermal conductivity and viscosity do not
differ significantly from their bulk counterparts, as is the

For graphite in the low-temperature (<
∼100 K) regime,
the bulk in-plane viscosity components are constant or
slowly increasing with temperature; at higher temperatures, the viscosity components increase with temperature up to reaching their saturation values. For a
graphite polycrystalline sample with a grain size of 10µm,
finite-size effects on viscosity (and on conductivity) are
small. For diamond in the temperature regime below
90 K, the bulk values of the thermal viscosity increase
with increasing temperature, then in the intermediate
<
temperature regime (100 K <
∼ T ∼ 300 K) they decrease
with temperature, and finally for increasingly higher temperatures they gently increase up to saturating to the
high-temperature limiting values. However, size effects
renormalize this behavior for temperatures below 300 K,
leaving viscosity components that increase with temperature. In silicon, increasing temperature yields a decrease,
up to a high-temperature saturation value, of the bulk
thermal viscosity; size effect renormalize the viscosity below ∼ 100 K yielding viscosity components that increase
with temperature (i.e. a behavior analogous to that of
diamond). We note that in the high-temperature limit,
i.e. when the thermal conductivity decay as T −1 [3, 78],
the viscosity components tend to constant values for all
these three materials. The total bulk thermal conductivities are shown in the insets of Fig. 1 for comparison
(we only show one component; for diamond and silicon
the conductivity tensor is isotropic, for graphite we show
the in-plane component). The off-plane transport coefficients for graphite are discussed in Fig. 9a. In graphite,
the bulk thermal conductivity below 100 K does not increase monotonically as the temperature is decreased due
to the presence of natural-abundance isotopic scattering.
Natural-abundance isotopic scattering has been considered also for diamond and silicon, and the thermal conductivity at low temperatures is much lower than for
isotopically-pure diamond [25, 79–84] or silicon [85]. We
have also verified that the effects of phonon coherences
are negligible in these crystals [38]. We note in passing
that, even if the thermal conductivities of diamond and
silicon differ by more than one order of magnitude, their
largest thermal-viscosity components differ only by a factor of 3. These results may be compared with the case of
water, whose dynamic (shear) viscosity is 8.5·10−3 Pa·s
at room temperature, indicating that the thermal viscosity found here is comparable or larger. To a good approximation, water is an incompressible fluid, and thus
its largest viscosity component is ijij, also called “first
viscosity” or “shear viscosity”. For compressible fluids,
the iiii components of the viscosity tensor — also called
“second viscosity” or “volume viscosity” [86] — are nonnegligible. Here, in contrast with water, the iiii component of the thermal viscosity tensor is the largest, which

dashed lines are plotted as a guide to the eye, to underscore
how even and odd relaxons are fully decoupled. Odd relaxons, which determine the thermal conductivity, yield negligible (zero) contributions to the thermal viscosity; conversely,
even relaxons determine the thermal viscosity and yield negligible (zero) contributions to thermal conductivity.

elicits an analogy to a compressible fluid. It is important to mention that the present formulation may need
further extension to deal with unstrained 2D materials,
since their flexural phonon modes have a quadratic dispersion ων ∝ q 2 at T = 0K [87]. Under these conditions,
long-wavelength phonons lead to q · u being larger than
ων , causing negative values of the phonon drifting distribution which are not compatible with a semiclassical description of transport. Further work is needed to address
this issue, for example considering the phonon renormalization due to coupling between bending and stretching
degrees of freedom of the monolayer [88] or the presence
of a substrate [89], or introducing the Wigner-function
formalism [38, 90].
Finally, it is worth checking the complementary character of the thermal conductivity and viscosity that
arises from their decoupled relaxons’ contributions. As
commented above, decomposing the thermal conductivity [27] and viscosity (9) in terms of single relaxons it is
possible to show that the thermal viscosity is uniquely
determined by the even part of the relaxon spectrum,
while the thermal conductivity is determined uniquely by
the odd part of the relaxon spectrum [27]. In Fig. 2 we
highlight the contributions of each relaxon to the total
thermal conductivity and viscosity, confirming numerically this picture.

VISCOUS HEAT EQUATIONS

We show here that heat conduction can be described
by two novel viscous heat equations that cover on the
same footing both the Fourier and hydrodynamic limits, and all intermediate regimes. These are two coupled
equations in the temperature T (r, t) and drift-velocity
u(r, t) fields, which are parametrized by the thermal viscosity and conductivity. These equations represent the
thermal counterpart of the Stokes equations of fluid dy-

vectors φiν ∝ ~q i ∝ ∂uνi ∝ nD
ν , i = 1, 2, 3 (where 3 is the
dimensionality of the system) already introduced for the
evaluation of the viscosity; these φiν are eigenvectors with
zero eigenvalue for the normal part of the scattering matrix Ω̃N
νν 0 and are associated to the conservation of crystal
momentum by normal scattering events [13, 16, 20]. We
note that these four eigenvectors constitute the first two
terms of the phonon distribution expansion in Eq. (4).
We can thus derive the mesoscopic equations that govern the evolution of the temperature (T (r, t)) and drift
velocity (u(r, t)) fields projecting the microscopic LBTE
in the subspaces spanned by φ0ν and by φiν (i = 1, . . . , 3).
In order to derive a closed-form equation for the drift velocity, when projecting in the subspace spanned by φiν we
consider the effects of momentum dissipation only within
that subspace. The result is the following set of equations
(see Appendix D for a detailed derivation):

namics — i.e. the Navier-Stokes equations in the linear
regime, whose solution yields the laminar flow — where
temperature takes the role of pressure and the phonon
drift velocity that of the fluid velocity. In the kinetic
regime, when momentum-dissipating (Umklapp) scattering processes dominate [31], these viscous heat equations
become equivalent to Fourier’s heat equation.
As underscored before, hydrodynamic thermal transport is characterized by energy conservation and crystal
momentum quasi-conservation (the latter being exactly
conserved only in absence of Umklapp processes [13]).
Conserved quantities in the LBTE dynamics can be related to the eigenvectors of the full or normal scattering
matrix with zero eigenvalues [20] (see also Appendix A).
Four of these eigenvectors (i.e. phonon distribution functions) can be identified. The first one is the Bose-Einstein
N̄ν
eigenvector φ0ν ∝ ~ων ∝ ∂∂T
∝ ñTν , which is the eigenvector of zero eigenvalue for the symmetrized full scattering
matrix Ω̃νν 0 ; its zero eigenvalue is associated to energy
conservation in scattering events (both normal and Umklapp). The other three eigenvectors are the drift eigen-

coupled evolution of the scalar temperature field and of
the vector drift-velocity field; they constitute the main
result of this work and we name these “viscous heat
equations”. These transport equations are reminiscent
of the linearized Stokes equations for fluids: to see this
more clearly, we note that local energy E(r, t) and crystal momentum P (r, t) are proportional to temperature
and drift velocity respectively (E(r, t) = C T (r, t) and
P i (r, t) = Ai ui (r, t), where C is the specific heat and
A is the specific momentum). Exploiting these relationships, it is possible to rewrite the viscous heat equations
in a more familiar form, namely as energy E and momentum P i balance equations:

Finally, ∂P

The distinction between temperature-driven and drifting
components of the heat flux (Qδ (r, t) and QD (r, t), respectively) is essential for hydrodynamic transport. We
will show in Sec. VI that Fourier’s law is recovered in the
limiting case where crystal momentum dissipation dominates over viscous effects and is the fastest timescale of
the phonon dynamics.
It is worth mentioning that the viscous heat equations
introduced here differ from the Stokes equations for fluids in two major ways. First, there is no analogous to
the mass conservation satisfied by Stokes equations, since
the total phonon number is not a constant of motion
(e.g. a phonon coalescence event decreases the number
of phonons in the system). Second, while collisions between molecules in the fluid conserve momentum, scattering among phonons does not conserve crystal momentum
in presence of Umklapp processes.
The most relevant feature of the viscous heat equations

is their capability to describe hydrodynamic thermal
transport in terms of mesoscopic quantities, i.e. temperature and drift velocity, resulting in a much simpler and
computationally less expensive approach than the microscopic LBTE. The parameters entering Eqs. (10, 11) can
be determined from first-principles calculations or, possibly less accurately, from classical potentials, and are
tabulated in Appendix E for graphite, diamond and silicon.
In order to be solved, the viscous heat equations require appropriate boundary conditions on the temperature and drift velocity. Boundary conditions on temperature have been widely studied in conjunction with
Fourier’s heat equation [91]: typically, one makes assumptions on the system’s capability to exchange heat at
the boundaries, and on the temperature at those boundaries (Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions, respectively [91]). In the next section V we consider a
system in which the temperature is fixed at some boundaries, while the others are assumed to be adiabatic (that
is, the heat flux across these boundaries is zero). In contrast, boundary conditions on the drift velocity, i.e. on
crystal momentum at the sample’s borders, have not been
studied as extensively. Since crystal momentum is not
conserved at boundaries [13], we impose a no-slip condition of zero drift velocity u(r, t) on all boundaries, ensuring thus zero drifting heat QD (r, t) ∝ u(r, t). As discussed in past work [3, 35], more comprehensive boundary conditions require quantifying phonon reflection at
surfaces, and are beyond the scope of this work.
The viscous heat equations (10,11) improve upon past
work on different levels. First, they are valid for general dispersion relations for phonons, and thus overcome
the limitations — pointed out by Hardy and Albers [21]
already in 1974 — of the pioneering mesoscopic models developed in the 1960s by Guyer-Krumhansl [16, 17]
or Gurzhi [15], which assumed linear-isotropic or powerlaw phonon dispersion relations, respectively (assumptions which arose from the hypothesis that hydrodynamic phenomena would occur at cryogenic temperatures
only). The limitations of the Guyer-Krumhansl [16, 17]
and Gurzhi [15] models were overcome in 1974 by Hardy
and Albers [21], who derived from the LBTE a set of
mesoscopic equations for energy and crystal momentum
valid for a general phonon dispersion relation (i.e. not
necessarily linear-isotropic). Hardy and Albers’ formulation relies on the hydrodynamic approximation — i.e.
that the fastest timescale of phonon dynamics is that
of normal processes — that is valid only within the hydrodynamic regime, where Umklapp collisions are rare
events. In fact, Hardy and Albers’ equations are limited
just to the hydrodynamic regime and do not incorporate Fourier’s law as a limit (and thus any intermediate regimes). The viscous heat equations address exactly
this issue, and Fourier’s law emerges when crystal momentum dissipation (due to Umklapp processes or scattering with boundaries) dominates over viscous effects
and is the fastest timescale of the phonon dynamics (see

8
Sec. VI). Finally, the viscous heat equations take into account the entire collision matrix, at variance with recent
mesoscopic models derived from the LBTE either in the
SMA [60] or in the Callaway approximation [63].
IV.

SECOND SOUND

Second sound is the coherent propagation of a temperature wave [13, 17, 19, 20, 40, 43, 92–95], and it is an
effect properly described by the viscous heat equations.
From a phenomenological point of view, second sound
appears when the temperature field satisfies the following damped wave equation [20] (we define x as the second
sound propagation direction):

(14)

where τss and vss are the second-sound relaxation time
and undamped propagation velocity, yet to be determined. In contrast to Fourier’s law, which has the form of
a classical (non-relativistic) diffusion equation and states
that a temperature-gradient variation causes an instantaneous variation of the heat flux, Eq. (14) has the physical
property that a sudden localized change of temperature
propagates in space with a finite speed (i.e. it is not felt
instantly everywhere in space) [12, 96–98]. The temperature profile that solves Eq. (14) has the form of a damped
wave:
T (x, t) = T̄ + δT ei(kx−ω̄(k)t) e−t/τss ,

(15)

where the second sound frequency ω̄(k) depends on the
second-sound wavevector k. In Appendix F we derive
the second-sound equation from the viscous heat equations (10,11) following two different approaches (bottomup and top-down). In the first bottom-up approach
we find the conditions for which the damped wave
equation (14) emerges form the viscous heat equations
Eq. (10,11). When this happens, the solution of Eq. (14)
is the damped wave equation for temperature (15) shown
above, with p

2 k 2 − (2τ )−2 (this can be easily veriby ω̄(k) = vss

to express τss and vss in terms of the parameters appearing in the viscous heat equations; in particular,

group velocity vg (k) = ∂ ω̄(k)
∂k = kvss [k + (2τss vss )
and we note that it reduces to the undamped propagation
velocity vss in the undamped limit τss → 0.
These results are consistent with empirical expectations on second sound: in the limit of weak crystal momentum dissipation the second-sound relaxation time increases, while the velocity becomes smaller, making second sound more likely to be observed in the hydrodyxx
namic regime [17, 20]. In fact, when DU
→ 0 we find

xx −1
x
that τss → (DU
) and vss → Wx0
. We note that the
viscous heat equations describe not only the propagation
of the temperature field, but also that of the drift velocity.
In Appendix F we show that when second sound emerges
the drift-velocity field propagates as a damped wave as
well (i.e. similar to Eq. (15)), with the same relaxation
time and velocity of temperature, but with a phase shift
of π/2.
Phase shifts between hydrodynamic and resistive components of the frequency-dependent heat flux
have also been discussed recently in the context of an
improved Callaway approximation for the LBTE [99].
As an alternative, we took inspiration from Ref. [40],
which derived the second-sound dispersion relations by
taking advantage of the Laplace transform of the LBTE,
to identify solutions in the form of a damped wave following a top-down approach. In particular, we take a
damped-wave ansatz for temperature, Eq. (15), and a
similar one for the drift-velocity field (with the same
frequency and decay time of temperature); we substitute these into the viscous heat equations (10,11) and
determine the conditions under which these are acceptable solutions. As detailed in Appendix F, we find
that the dispersion relations of second sound in the

U
with the first bottom-up approach presented to derive
the equations for second sound. We further stress that
the LBTE can only rigorously describe second sound in
the long-wavelength limit k → 0 in order for the temperature to be slowly varying (for which the two approaches
shown in this section provide the same result); for smaller
wavelengths, the definition of temperature itself becomes
questionable [100].
We also recall that Enz [19] and Hardy [20] distinguished between “drifting” and “driftless” second sound.
The former emerges when normal processes dominate and
is described in terms of balance equations for energy and
momentum; the latter is determined by a uniform energy flux that decays exponentially. The second sound
discussed here is of the drifting kind, as it emerges from
a set of balance equations for energy and crystal momentum derived from the LBTE.

80K/60K on the left/right boundaries, a zero total heat flux is imposed at the other boundaries, and zero drift velocity is
imposed on all boundaries (no-slip boundary condition). With this choice of boundary conditions, the phonon distribution
reduces to the Bose-Einstein distribution on the left/right boundaries, where the temperature is fixed. Despite having local
equilibrium at the left/right boundaries, a non-zero drift velocity is present in the material as a consequence of the coupling
in Eq. (10) between drift velocity and temperature. Panel c) shows the x-component of the heat flux along sections taken at
x = 1.5 µm (orange, gray, red) and x = 9.0 µm (black, blue, green); solid lines are the results obtained from the viscous heat

imposing a no-slip condition on u at all boundaries.
We show in Fig. 3 the viscous heat flux Qδ + QD ,
and the flux predicted by Fourier’s law QFourier (left
panels) and contrast the Fourier and viscous heat flux
components across two different sections (right panel).
We stress that Fourier’s law lacks a description of the
contribution to the heat flux derived from the local drift
velocity [13, 102, 103]. As a result, Fourier’s law misses
qualitative and quantitative properties of the heat flux
profile. The largest differences are observed in proximity
of spatial inhomogeneities, such as boundaries or corners.
For example, QD quickly increases (decreases) in proximity of the thermal reservoir on the hot-left (cold-right)
side of the sample; these changes in QD determine opposite changes in Qδ . Microscopically, these variations are
caused by the rapid transition of the phonon distribution
from the Bose-Einstein equilibrium distribution imposed
at the boundaries to an out-of-equilibrium distribution

carrying non-zero total crystal momentum (i.e. a drift
velocity) inside the sample.
We report in Fig. 3c the total heat flux profiles along
two transversal sections of the sample, contrasting the
prediction from the viscous heat equations (solid lines)
with that of Fourier’s law (dashed lines). Along these sections, Fourier’s law predicts a flat heat flux profile, while
the viscous heat equations yield a Poiseuille-like profile.
The results from the viscous heat equations are thus substantially different from Fourier’s predictions, and the behavior of the heat flux can be understood from a simple
analytical 1D solution of the viscous heat equations in
the absence of Umklapp processes [13]: as discussed in
Appendix G, the flux is described by hyperbolic
q funcµκ
tions with a characteristic length scale b =
AC(W )2
(an estimate of the friction lengths, see Ref. [35]). At
distances from the surface larger than b we recover the
flat behavior typical of the bulk. We also note that these
results mimic those from the (computationally very ex-

in the frequency-dependent SMA approximation [77] or
considering the full scattering operator [35]), which generates a minimum flux on surfaces and maximum at the
sample’s center. We further note that, at variance with
classical fluid dynamics and as pointed out in Ref. [35],
the total heat flux does not drop to zero at the boundaries: the no-slip condition sets the drifting heat flux QD
to zero, but the temperature-driven component Qδ is still
allowed to be nonzero.
In Fig. 4 we plot the difference between the temperature profile predicted by Fourier’s law and the viscous heat equations along longitudinal (top panel) and
transversal (bottom panel) directions. The insets in
Fig. 4b show the results of the viscous equations (solid
blue line) and Fourier’s law (dashed red line) along the
section y = 4.5 µm. Along the transversal direction
(Fig. 4a), Fourier’s law and Eqs. (10, 11) predict temperature profiles which are substantially different in the presence of variations of the sample’s shape (green line corresponding to x = 3.3 µm), while they are merely shifted
by a positive or negative offset away from these; the
precise amount depends on the distance from the fixed-

temperature boundaries. These differences become more
clear by inspecting the longitudinal direction (Fig. 4b),
where the discrepancy between the temperature predicted by Fourier’s law and Eqs. (10, 11) is largest at
x ' 3 µm, i.e. where the sample of Fig. 3 changes geometry. We show in the inset of Fig. 4b that also the longitudinal temperature profile (for y = 4.5 µm) changes
when going from Fourier’s law (dashed red line) to the
viscous heat equations (solid blue line). The difference
is maximized close to variations of the sample’s shape
at x = 3 µm and at the boundaries x = 0 and x = 15
µm; in this latter case, the viscous heat equations predict
steeper-than-Fourier’s law or non-linear temperature gradients that are reminiscent of those obtained in molecular
dynamics simulations [104–113] and in explicit solutions
of the LBTE [35].
VI.

FOURIER DEVIATION NUMBER

In this section, we introduce a descriptor that
parametrizes the conditions under which hydrodynamic
heat conduction is observed; we will refer to this as the
“Fourier deviation number” (FDN). In particular, we aim
at distinguishing the diffusive regime from the hydrodynamic regime: in the former case the viscous heat equations become equivalent to Fourier’s law, while in the
latter case Fourier’s law no longer holds and the viscous
heat equations are required.
In order to investigate how the hydrodynamic deviations from Fourier’s law depend on the sample’s sizes and
reference temperature T̄ , we solve the viscous heat equations and Fourier’s equation for several samples having
different dimensions, and at various reference temperatures T̄ . We perform this analysis for graphite (Fig. 5a),
diamond (Fig. 5b) and silicon (Fig. 5c). In particular,
we consider samples that are similar — in the geometric sense — to the reference sample shown in Fig. 3, i.e.
we generate samples of different dimensions starting from
the reference sample of Fig. 3 and varying the sizes via
a uniform scaling. Following this protocol, we vary the
sample’s length lTOT , reported on the y−axis of Fig. 5ac, from 0.1 to 100 µm (e.g. the reference sample of Fig. 3
corresponds to y = 15 µm, y = 100 µm corresponds to
a sample obtained magnifying uniformly by a factor of
100/15 ' 6.66 the sizes of the reference sample). The
color in Fig. 5a-c represents the normalized L2 distance
between the temperature profile predicted by Fourier’s
law and the viscous heat equations for a given sample
length lTOT and reference temperature T̄ :

(16)

and in order to ease the qualitative interpretation of
these results later, we evaluate L2 in the spatiallyhomogeneous region G defined by x > 15 lTOT . We also

11
inspected the effects of shape on the deviation L2 , finding that the magnitude of L2 is larger for geometries with
spatial non-homogeneities that imply larger values of the
drift velocity’s second derivative; nevertheless, the dependence of L2 on lTOT and T̄ is qualitatively unchanged for
different shapes.
Results in Figs. 5a-c have been computed accounting for finite-size effects as discussed in Sec. II and Appendix C. Additionally, to better compare with the experimental results of Ref. [43], we make the hypothesis
of working with polycrystalline graphite with an average
crystal grain size of 10 µm as in Ref. [43]: as a result,
the transport coefficients of graphite are renormalized by
the system size for lTOT < 10 µm, and by the grain size
for lTOT > 10 µm (therefore, for lTOT > 10 µm size
effects are given only by the boundary conditions effects
on the temperature and drift-velocity fields). In graphite,
the difference between Fourier’s law and the viscous heat
equations is largest in the temperature range 60-80 K and
<
for sizes 10µm <
∼ lTOT ∼ 20µm.
Turning our attention to diamond, we first recall that
its thermal properties are characterized by a very large
thermal conductivity, which originates from having large
group velocities and weak Umklapp scattering [79–84];
the latter condition being favorable to the emergence
of hydrodynamic effects. This is confirmed by the results shown in Fig. 5b, with the hydrodynamic deviation
being largest around room temperature and dimension
lTOT >
∼ 1 µm (we note in passing that, at this temperature and size, the surface-renormalization of transport
coefficients is small and well compatible with the mesoscopic approach described in this work). These results
suggest that a hydrodynamic window exists also for diamond, and that therefore hydrodynamic behavior (e.g.
second sound) might be measurable in this material at
temperatures even larger than graphite.
For silicon, instead, the deviation from Fourier’s law
is smaller and takes place at lower temperatures. Silicon is an example of a material for which the thermal conductivity computed within the SMA approximation is very close to the conductivity computed from
the exact solution of the LBTE [23, 25, 27, 114], and
it is known that the SMA works reasonably well in systems where momentum-dissipating (Umklapp) scattering
events dominate over those conserving crystal momentum (normal) [34, 114]. Therefore, the negligible magnitude of hydrodynamic effects predicted by the viscous
heat equations for silicon is consistent with the predominance of Umklapp over normal scattering events known
to occur in this material. We last remark that, in contrast to graphite, results for diamond and silicon have
been computed for single crystals, i.e. transport coefficients are not limited by grains’ size.
In order to capture intuitively and inexpensively
all these trends we introduce an approach inspired
by the definition of the Reynolds number, and we
rewrite the viscous heat equations (10, 11) in adimensional form (we follow the standard procedure used

e.g. in fluid dynamics, which is also called “Buckingham Pi theorem” [115, 116]). First, we extract
the magnitudes of the tensors appearing in the viscous heat equations, factorizing the largest component:
Ai =Am ai , where Am = max(|Ai |) and ai = Ai /Am is an
i

adimensional tensor with the largest component having modulus equal to 1. Similarly, we factorize the
largest component of all other tensors: κij =κm kij (with
j

Then,

we define a set of dimensionless variables r ∗ = r/L,
u∗ = u/u0 , and T ∗ = T /δT , where L, u0 and δT are a
characteristic size, drift velocity and temperature perturbation (more on these later). Substituting these variables
in Eqs. (10, 11), and limiting ourselves to the steady-state
regime, we obtain:

parameters is to account for the correct order of magnitude of the five summations appearing in Eqs. (17,18);
they carry a Cartesian superscript i whenever they may
depend on direction, and their subscripts indicate the
number of indexes summed in their definition. For example, for a 3×3 isotropic tensor χij = χm δ ij (where χm

Because we are computing the FDN for the planar geometry discussed in Fig. 3, we can discard the z component (i.e. the Cartesian direction indexed by 3) from
Eqs. (17,18). Then, for diamond, silicon and in-plane
graphite, transport properties are isotropic (i.e. all the
2nd -rank tensors appearing in Eq. (17) and Eq.
√ (18) are
diagonal). From this it follows that g(w·√ a)2 = 2;
g(k)2 = 2; g i (w)1 = 1 ∀ i = 1, 2; and g i ( a⊗a·d)1 =

identifies the deviations between the solutions of the Fourier and of the viscous heat equations solutions.

— and thus Fourier-like behavior — can also emerge
for very small (sub-micrometer) length scales, where
ballistic effects are relevant and strongly renormalize the
transport coefficients, as discussed in Appendix C. The
emergence of Fourier-like behavior in the ballistic regime
(with a size-dependent thermal conductivity alike to
that employed here) has been explained in a recent work
[117], confirming that the results for sub-micrometer
sizes obtained with the aforementioned approximated
treatment of boundary scattering are qualitatively
correct. If we insert the condition π3  1 in Eq. (17),

so that the viscous heat flux is well approximated by
Fourier’s flux; the same limiting behavior is observed also
in diamond and silicon. On the other hand, deviations
from the temperature profile predicted by Fourier’s law
appear when both π1 and π3 are large. In fact, π3 >

implies that the temperature gradient in Eq. (18) is
coupled to the second derivative of the drift velocity,
and one can not obtain a Fourier-like equation as before;
large values of π1 imply that the drift velocity affects
the evolution of temperature in Eq. (17). It follows that
Fourier’s law is mathematically recovered for crystal
momentum dissipation dominating over viscous effects
and/or large characteristic size (π3 1), but deviations
between the viscous and Fourier temperature profile
can be small even when viscous effects dominate over
crystal momentum dissipation (π3 1) if the coupling
between drift velocity and temperature in Eq. (17)
is small (π1 1). We note in passing that while this
reasoning has been made here at steady state, it can
be straightforwardly extended to the time-dependent
case, considering time variations of the drifting velocity
slow compared to the crystal momentum dissipation
timescale.

which provides a simple estimate of the deviations from
Fourier’s law: the larger the FDN, the larger the deviations from Fourier’s law. In Fig. 5d-f, we plot the
FDN for graphite, diamond and silicon as a function
of sample’s total length lTOT and reference temperature
T̄ . Remarkably, the FDN captures the trends of the exact solution of the viscous heat equations (Fig. 5a-c),
thus identifying accurately the regime where hydrodynamic behavior emerges.
The magnitude of FDN is
directly proportional to the magnitude of hydrodynamic
effects: a larger FDN implies a larger difference between

A detailed analysis of the π terms as a function of temperature for a graphite sample geometrically similar to that
in Fig. 3 and with a fixed total length lTOT = 10µm is
shown in Fig. 6a, where lTOT = 10µm has been chosen to
match the length fixed in the experiments by Huberman
et al. [43] to investigate the magnitude of hydrodynamic
effects as a function of temperature. Importantly, the
FDN at fixed lTOT = 10µm predicts hydrodynamic effects to be largest at temperatures that match very well
those measured in recent experiments for second sound in
graphite [43]. Then, we rationalize the trend of FDN as a
function of temperature in terms of the π terms entering
in Eq. (22): π1 increases with temperature for T<
∼ 100
K and saturates to a constant value at high temperature
and π3 decreases asymptotically like T −2 . Fig. 6b shows
the analysis of FDN as a function of the sample’s size
lTOT (varied according to the aforementioned protocol)
at fixed temperature 85 K, i.e. the temperature fixed in
the experiments by Huberman et al. [43] to investigate
the magnitude of hydrodynamic effects as a function of
size. Also in this case, FDN predicts hydrodynamic effects to be largest in a size range that matches very well
the sizes at which hydrodynamic effects have been measured. We thus conclude that the present model is capable of describing quantitatively the hydrodynamic window that has been recently measured in graphite. In
Appendix I, we also show that for diamond extending
the sizes in Fig. 5e up to 10 mm yields an increase of
FDN for temperatures around 50-60 K and dimensions
∼ 1 mm. This result is in qualitative agreement with
the predictions for diamond’s second sound window performed using the reduced isotropic crystal model or the
Callaway model [45]. Finally, the parameters entering in
the πi (i = 1, 2, 3) are exactly the same used for the numerical solutions of the viscous heat equations in Fig. 5ac.

CONCLUSIONS

We have introduced a framework to describe heat
conduction beyond Fourier’s law and to capture in the
process the hydrodynamic transport regime where the
phonon gas assumes a drift velocity and heat propagation resembles fluid dynamics. Just as a perturbation of
the temperature generates an energy flux that is proportional to thermal conductivity, a perturbation of the drift
velocity generates a crystal momentum flux, with the proportionality tensor coefficient between the two being a
thermal viscosity. We have shown that thermal conductivity and viscosity can be determined exactly and in a
closed form as a sum over relaxons (i.e. the eigenvectors of the phonon scattering matrix). Relaxons have a
well-defined parity and even relaxons contribute exclusively to the thermal viscosity (odd relaxons contribute
exclusively to the thermal conductivity [27]).
Most importantly, the microscopic LBTE has been

coarse-grained into two novel mesoscopic viscous heat
equations, which are coupled equations parametrized by
the thermal conductivity and viscosity that govern the
evolution of the temperature and drift-velocity fields.
The viscous heat equations provide a general description
of heat transfer encompassing both the Fourier and the
hydrodynamic regimes, and all intermediate cases, allowing for the emergence of second sound, and of Poiseuillelike heat flow associated to a temperature profile deviating from Fourier’s law. In addition, these viscous heat
equations show that the thermal conductivity is not sufficient to describe thermal transport in general terms, but
also its complementary quantity, the thermal viscosity,
must be taken into account.
We have characterized the hydrodynamic behavior in
terms of the Fourier deviation number (FDN), a dimensionless parameter that quantifies hydrodynamic deviations from Fourier’s law. At a negligible computational
cost, the FDN enables to study the temperature-and-size
window at which hydrodynamic phenomena such as second sound emerge.
The full solution of the viscous heat equations allows
to predict measurable temperature and heat flux profiles
in complex shaped devices in the mesoscopic heat transport regime at a much reduced cost, and more transparently, than solving the full LBTE, therefore paving
the way towards understanding shape and size effects in
complex and microscopic devices, and especially when
novel physics arises, such is the case in phononic devices
[118–130]. These results are particularly relevant for the
emerging field of materials that display hydrodynamic
thermal transport, often characterized by large thermal
conductivities [31, 39–46]. Such behavior has been investigated in devices made either of graphite, diamond
or silicon. For graphite, the present formulation predicts
the hydrodynamic windows (as a function of temperature for a fixed size, or as a function of size for a fixed
temperature) in excellent agreement with recent experimental findings [43], while suggesting that hydrodynamic
behavior can also appear in diamond at room temperature for micrometer-sized crystals.
Finally, we remark that the present methodology can
be adapted to describe viscous phenomena for electronic
conduction [131–134], or any other transport phenomena
described by a linearized Boltzmann equation.

The drift eigenvectors (A12) are, in general, not orthogonal [21]. Nevertheless, we work in a Cartesian coordinate
system for q 0 and u(r, t), so that these 3 eigenvectors are
orthogonal and can also be normalized, choosing Ai from
the condition φi |φi = 1. In computing the normalization constants Ai , we note that they can be expressed in

we note that the crystal momentum density associated

Finally, it is worth mentioning that in going from equation (5) to equation (6), the term nD
ν (r, t) has disappeared due to the following approximation:

This is correct both at high and low temperatures, because at high temperatures the strong crystal momentum dissipation ensures ñD
ν 0 (r, t) ∝ u(r, t) ≈ 0 (see also
Fig. 10), and at low temperatures Umklapp processes are
frozen (Ω̃U
νν 0 ≈ 0).

Local equilibrium

From Eq. (A7) and Eq. (A15) it follows that, in
the hydrodynamic regime, the distributions nTν (r, t) and
nD
ν (r, t) are left unchanged by the dynamics described
by the LBTE; therefore, these are local equilibrium distributions. It follows that nTν (r, t) and nD
ν (r, t) do not
appear in Eq. (6) and Eq. (7) and thus do not contribute
to the thermal conductivity and viscosity, which respectively describe the response to a perturbation of the local temperature and drift velocity. It is worth mentioning
T
that, in the kinetic regime, nD
ν (r, t) vanishes and nν (r, t)
is still a stationary distribution for the LBTE.

where Π̄ij is the equilibrium (constant) crystal momentum flux, which is not affected by the LBTE’s dynamics; Πij
T (r, t) is the momentum flux related to the local equilibrium temperature and Πij
δE (r, t) is the out-ofequilibrium momentum flux generated in response to deviations from local equilibrium conditions and is further
discussed below.
As stated by Eq. (8), the thermal viscosity tensor η ijkl
relates a drift velocity perturbation to the momentum
flux generated as a response to that perturbation. Eq. (8)
is valid in the mesoscopic regime mentioned in Sec. II and
V, where the thermal viscosity is space-independent and
non-homogeneities arise mainly from variations of the local temperature and local drift velocity. In particular,
η ijkl is determined by deviations from local equilibrium
and thus depends only on nδE . To determine the distribution nδE , we must solve the LBTE linearized in the
drift velocity gradient Eq. (7). To this aim, we first symmetrize the LBTE using the transformations (A2), finding

Appendix D: Viscous heat equations

In this section we derive an extension to Fourier’s law
from the LBTE, which describes mesoscopic hydrodynamic thermal transport in terms of the temperature
T (r, t) and drift velocity u(r, t) fields. We focus on
the mesoscopic regime where transport coefficients are
well-defined and non-homogeneities arise from variations
of the temperature and drift velocity. In contrast to
Sec. II, here the temperature and drift velocity gradients are space-dependent, and consequently the LBTE is
not linearized in the temperature and drift velocity gradients. We start recalling that hydrodynamic thermal
transport emerges when most collisions between phonon
wavepackets conserve the crystal momentum. This can
happen, for example, when the mean free path for normal
collisions ΛN is much smaller than the boundary scattering’s length LS (for a single crystal LS is the sample’s
size, in the case of a polycrystalline sample LS is the
size of the grains) or the mean free path for Umklapp
collisions ΛU : ΛN  LS , ΛU [15, 31]. Under these conditions, the local equilibrium is expressed in terms of the
four special eigenvectors φ0ν (also denoted θν0 , since this is
a common eigenvector for the full and normal scattering
operator, see Appendix A), φiν (i = 1, 2, 3) described in
Sec. (A 1,A 2), and of the local temperature T (r, t) and
drift velocity u(r, t) fields. As explained in Sec. (A 1,A 2),

19
these four special eigenvectors do not contribute to thermal conductivity and viscosity (i.e. they do not appear
in Eqs. (6) and (7)), since these latter coefficients only
describe the response to a perturbation of the local equilibrium.
In order to exploit the relationship between the drift
velocity u(r, t) and the drift eigenvectors φiν , we choose
to work with the basis of eigenvectors of the normal scatN
tering matrix Ω̃N
νν 0 . To this aim, we diagonalize Ω̃νν 0 as

where β is an eigenvalue index, φβν an eigenvector, and

We now project the LBTE (D3) in the subspace spanned
by the Bose-Einstein eigenvector φ0ν , i.e. we take the
scalar product of Eq. (D3) with φ0ν , finding

β

the analytic expression for the 4 of them associated with
energy and momentum conservation, which we label with
β = 0 for the energy eigenvector (in this section we will
use φ0ν to label the Bose-Einstein eigenvector (A8)), and
β = 1, . . . , 3 for the momentum eigenvectors, Eq. (A12).
Noting that the set of “normal” eigenvectors {φβν }
(“normal” in the sense that they diagonalize Ω̃N
νν 0 , the
part of the scattering matrix that accounts for normal
processes only) is a complete basis set [16], we write the
deviation from equilibrium ñν (r, t) as a linear combination of these eigenvectors:

ñν (r, t) =

where we used the fact that only odd components of the

where only odd eigenvectors contribute (W0β
= 0 for
even β eigenvectors). As explained in Sec. (A 3), the
thermal conductivity is determined only from odd eigenvectors that are not related to local equilibrium (that
is, all the odd eigenvectors minus the three drift eigenvectors). At this point it is crucial to recall that the
relaxons have a well defined parity (even or odd), deriving from the symmetries of the full scattering operator
Ω̃νν 0 = Ω̃−ν,−ν 0 [20, 137]. Because the same symmetries
apply to Ω̃N
ν,ν 0 , also the eigenvectors of the normal scattering operator have a well defined parity [20, 21, 137].
The odd component of the heat flux (and hence the thermal conductivity) is determined only from the odd part
of the LBTE’s solution ñδO
ν (r, t) [27, 137], and this can
be written either as a linear combination of odd relaxons (as done in Ref. [27]) or, equivalently, as a linear
combination of odd eigenvectors of the normal scattering matrix, as done here.
From the completeness of
these basis sets it follows that the heat flux (D12) arising from the odd out-of-equilibrium phonon distribution
determined from equation (6), and described as a linear
combination of odd eigenvectors of the normal scattering
matrix, is equivalent to the heat flux of Ref. [27] that is
written as a linear combination of odd relaxons (eigenvectors of the full scattering matrix). In an equivalent
way, the equation for the odd part of the LBTE (6) is
equivalent to the equation used to determine the thermal conductivity in Ref. [27], the only difference being
the basis chosen for the decomposition of the solution
(the relaxons in Ref. [27] and in the computation of the
thermal viscosity reported in Fig. 1, and the eigenvectors of the normal scattering matrix here). The choice of

(D13)

In Eq. (D13) the thermal conductivity is spaceindependent, i.e. Eq. (D13) is valid in the mesoscopic
regime where the thermal conductivity and viscosity
are space-independent and non-homogeneities arise solely
from variations of the local temperature and local drift
velocity. Eq. (D13) can be used to rewrite Eq. (D9) in
terms of the local temperature and drift velocity fields,
obtaining Eq. (10) of the main text:

Eq. (D14) is clearly not sufficient to fully describe the

will derive a complementary set of equations that completes the formulation.

2.

The projection of the LBTE on the 2nd /3rd /4th
eigenvectors (the momentum eigenspace)

In this section, we derive a set of balance equations for
crystal momentum. We start by recalling from Eq. (B2)
that the momentum flux receives contributions from
three different terms. Of these three, the first term is
a constant related to the equilibrium temperature, and
thus is not changed by the LBTE. Therefore, we focus
only on the momentum flux related to the local equilibrium temperature Πij
T (r, t) and the out-of-equilibrium
momentum flux generated in response to a drift velocity
gradient Πij
δE (r, t). Using the expression of the four special eigenvectors discussed in Sec. (A 1, A 2), we rewrite
these two momentum fluxes in the basis of eigenvectors
of the normal scattering matrix, finding:

the coefficients zβ (r, t) for the first four eigenvectors (β =

Next, we note that only even eigenvectors different from

implying that the viscous heat equations reduce to

From a mathematical point of view, the projection of
the LBTE in the Bose-Einstein subspace, performed computing the scalar product between the LBTE in the normal eigenvectors basis (D3) and the Bose-Einstein eigenvector (A8) ∝ ων , is equivalent to calculating the energy moment of the LBTE. Analogously, the projection
in the momentum subspace, performed calculating the
scalar product between the LBTE (D3) and the momentum eigenvectors (A12) ∝ q i , is equivalent to computing
the momentum moment of the LBTE.

Appendix E: Parameters entering the viscous heat
equations.

We report in Fig. 8 the trends as a function of temperature of all the parameters needed to solve the viscous
heat equations on the geometry of Fig. 3. Due to the
crystal symmetries of the materials considered, several
components of vectors and tensors are equivalent. 2nd rank tensors such as thermal conductivity (κij ), momenij

and diagonal for diamond and silicon; for graphite they
are isotropic and diagonal for in-plane (x, y) directions

Appendix F: Second sound

In this section we show that drifting second sound [17,
20, 40, 43], i.e. thermal transport in terms of a temperature damped wave, is described by the viscous heat
equations. We will first show the emergence of second
sound following a bottom-up approach, i.e. analyzing
the conditions under which the two viscous heat equations decouple with the first equation (10) reducing to a
damped wave equations for the temperature field. After-

23
wards, we will analyze second sound within the viscous
heat equations following a top-down approach, i.e. requiring the temperature field to have the mathematical
form of a damped wave and analyzing if and under which
conditions this can emerge from the viscous heat equations.

To this aim, we take the derivative with respect to x of
Eq. (F3), finding

Second sound from the viscous heat equations
(bottom-up approach)

For simplicity, we consider a system such that the teni
and κij appearing in the viscous heat equasors W0j
tions (10,11) are isotropic; the generalization to an
anisotropic case is analogous to what is reported here.
Without loss of generality, we consider x̂ as the direction of second sound propagation. For simplicity we
consider an isotropic system; the general derivation can
be obtained straightforwardly generalizing the procedure
reported here. In an isotropic system, the drifting heat
flux QD (r, t) is collinear with the drift velocity and the
heat flux due to local temperature changes Qδ (r, t) is
collinear with the temperature gradient. Thus, it follows
that the only nonzero component of the drift velocity
must be along the second sound propagation direction
ux = u (for simplicity we omit all tensor indexes in the
rest of this section, since the only the component having
all the indexes equal to x is needed for this discussion).
With these conditions, the viscous heat equations (10,11)
become:
C

(F5)
where Ô is a differential operator. Next, by applying
the operator Ô to both sides of equation (F2) and using
condition (F5), we obtain

In order to observe second sound, temperature changes
need to propagate following a damped wave equation. To

equation:

Therefore, if

The condition (F13) is derived from the requirement

Eq. (F14) into Eq. (F4). We note that for DU → 0 (that
is, negligible crystal momentum dissipation) vg (k) →
vss → W , i.e. the second sound propagation velocity
approaches the drifting second sound velocity defined by
Hardy [20]) and τss → DU −1 . Finally, the second sound

Eq. (F16) that, when second sound occur, temperature
and drift velocity are both damped waves with a phase
shift of π/2.
2.

Second sound from the viscous heat equations
(top-down approach)

In the previous section, we obtained second sound
properties by finding the conditions under which the
viscous equation for temperature (Eq. (10)) becomes a
damped wave equation. However, we can also obtain a
second sound equation taking inspiration from the approach outlined in Ref. [40], i.e. by looking for the conditions upon which the microscopic degrees of freedom
of the transport equation evolve as a damped wave. In
particular, we want to find the conditions such that the
solution of Eqs. (10,11) are
T (x, t) = T̄ + (δT )ei(kx−ω̄(k)t) e−t/τss ,
u(x, t) = u0 e

i(kx−ω̄(k)t) −t/τss

e

,

(F17)
(F18)

where δT and u0 are in general complex numbers to allow
for a phase difference between the two waves. We note

in particular that this guess for solution requires that
both temperature and drift velocity oscillate/decay at
the same frequency/rate, which is consistent with the
conditions (F9,F10) obtained in the previous section.
Using this guess for the solution, the derivation of the
dispersion relation and the decay time easily follows. To
this aim, we substitute Eqs. (F17,F18) in the viscous heat
equations (10,11) and find:

where we introduced a complex frequency ω̃(k) = ω̄(k) −

τss to simplify the calculation. The real part of this
complex frequency is the oscillation frequency of second
sound, whereas the imaginary part describes its decay
time. Next, we rewrite Eq. (F20) as:

that gives:
(−iC ω̃(k) + κk 2 )(ADU + µk 2 − iAω̃(k)) + CAW 2 k 2 = 0 .

ω̃(k) ≈ −

We can readily see that in the limit of small wavevectors
(k → 0) the non-trivial solution is ω̃k ≈ −iDU , that is,
the second sound oscillation frequency goes to zero, and
has a decay time set by the crystal momentum dissipation
rate: τss ≈ D1U . To estimate the behavior of the oscillation frequency, is instead convenient to recall the hypothesis of small Umklapp rates. In fact, if we set DU = 0,
we find ω̃(k) ≈ ±W k, that is, second sound disperses
ω̃k
linearly with k, and has a velocity vg (k) = ∂∂k
≈ W.
These limiting approximations (vg ≈ W and τss ≈ D1U )
are consistent with the results found in the previous section.

Appendix G: Analytical 1D example

The viscous heat equations (10,11) can be solved analytically in a handful of toy models. Here, for simplicity,
we neglect dissipation of momentum by Umklapp proij
cesses (DU
= 0) and consider steady-state heat diffusion
along the transversal direction of a thin film, so that the
problem becomes effectively a 1D problem, with x labeling the orthogonal direction position. In addition, since
we are considering a 1D geometry, we label A = Ax ,
x
W = W0x

velocity fields depend only on the position x. Under these
considerations the viscous heat equations (10,11) reduce

This analytical solution shares several qualitative similarities with the numerical example discussed in the main
text, and more clearly highlights how the factor 1/b represents a length scale at which surface scattering affects
thermal transport, which is in turn dependent on both
conductivity and viscosity. Moreover, we note that the
mathematical form of the solution has the same qualitative behavior of the problem studied by Sussmann and
Thellung [13], which serves as a verification of the present
model. At variance with their work however, the prefactors introduced here allow us to go beyond the Debye
approximation.

(G7)

In this section, we estimate the characteristic value of
the drift velocity (u0 ) in the high (uH ) and low (uL ) temperature regimes. These characteristic values are determined substituting in the viscous heat equations (10, 11)
the characteristic values of the temperature (and related
derivatives) and solving them approximatively for the velocity. With this aim, we start estimating the characteristic temperature gradient in the setup of Fig. 3 when
a temperature difference T̄ ± δT is imposed on the two
opposite sides (at x = 0 and x = 15 µm).
In this setup we clearly distinguish two regions. Choosing l = lTOT
10 as a length unit, where lTOT is the total
length of the sample (e.g. lTOT = 15µm for the sample
in Fig. 3), the left-hand-side region has length lL = 2 l
and width wL = 2 l, while the right-hand-side region
has length lR = 8 l and width wR = 6 l. Energy conservation requires that the current in the left-hand side
must be equal to the right-hand side. Therefore, the
heat flux on the left QL must be three times the heat
flux on the right side QL = 3QR . Using Fourier’s law
Q = −k∇T , and supposing that the thermal conductivity is constant throughout the sample, it follows that the
temperature gradients in the two regions are related as
∇x TL = 3∇x TR . Requiring the total temperature drop
to be equal to the temperature difference imposed by the
boundary conditions, we can write

To solve the problem, we specify the following no-slip
boundary conditions on a 1D geometry having length 2l:

u(x) = d cosh(bl) + a cosh bx ,

where we considered only the two largest components

these second derivatives, we note that, as shown in Fig. 3,
u(x, y) has a bell-like profile in the sample interior, which
vanishes at the boundaries. We thus proceed with a few
assumptions that allow us to make an estimate of uL .
First, we suppose that the average values of the second

Next, we note that the variation of u is stronger along
the y coordinate. To mimic the Poiseuille-like shape, we
assume the velocity profile to be constant along the x
direction, and parabolic along the y direction with vanishing velocity at the boundaries (y = 0 µm and y = wR ),
so that u(x, y) ' (−a · y(y − wR ), 0, 0). With these approximations, we can estimate the average value of the
parabolic velocity profile, i.e. the characteristic value of
the drift velocity at low temperatures uL , as:

Focusing from now on on the larger region on the right,
it follows that the temperature drop taking place is approximately given by ∆TR = − 87 δT .
To determine a characteristic value of drift velocity u0 ,
R
we substitute ∇TRx ' ∆T
lR in Eq. (11) and for simplicity consider isotropic symmetry, valid e.g. for silicon,
diamond and for graphite in the in-plane directions. u0
can be determined focusing on the steady state limit of
Eq. (11). We simplify its estimate considering separately
the limits of low and high temperatures.
In the high temperature limit, the term related to moij
mentum dissipation (∝ DU
) is much larger than the visijkl

The average value of u is interpolated in between the high
and low temperature limit using Matthiessen’s rule, as:
−1
−1
u−1
0 = uH + uL . The estimates of uH , uL and u0 for
graphite are reported in Fig. 10. We also compare this
rough estimate with the average value of ux (x, y) computed from the numerical solution of the viscous heat
equations on the region x > 15 lTOT of the geometry discussed in the main text and denoted denoted with hux i.
Despite the qualitative arguments used to derive u0 , the
estimate is able to capture qualitative trends and approximately reproduce average results from the numerical solution of the viscous heat equations.

Appendix I: Hydrodynamic behavior in macroscopic
diamond samples

In this section we show how extending the sizes in
Fig. 5e up to 10 mm yields another peak for FDN for
dimensions around 1 mm and temperatures around 5060 K. This result has been confirmed by full solutions
of the viscous heat equations similar to these reported
in Fig. 5b. The increase of FDN at low temperature
and large size reported in Fig. 11 is in qualitative agreement with the predictions for the second-sound window
performed using the reduced isotropic crystal model or
the Callaway model [45]. However, in contrast with this
work, Ref. [45] reports that an isotopic concentration
much lower than the natural isotope abundance is necessary for the observation of second sound in diamond.

FIG. 11. Hydrodynamic behavior in crystalline diamond at
natural isotopic abundance: increasing the dimension of the
diamond sample can yield an increase of the hydrodynamic
effects at low temperatures.

The analysis here and in Fig. 5 are limited to a
minimum reference temperature of T̄ = 50 K because, for lower temperatures, anharmonicity becomes
decreasingly smaller while size effects become increasingly larger, resulting in convergence issues for the numerical calculations (which would also require a refined, computationally-expensive, treatment of surface
effects [35]). Most importantly, the temperature/size
range reported in Fig. 5 highlights the most accessible experimental conditions under which hydrodynamic behav-

First-principles calculations are performed with the
Quantum ESPRESSO distribution [138, 139]. For all the
materials analyzed, the LDA functional is used due to
its capability to accurately describe the structural and
vibrational [140] properties of graphite [69], diamond
[25] and silicon [27], and its compatibility with the D3Q
code [32, 33] for first-principles calculations of anharmonic (third-order) interatomic force constants. Details
on the computation of the second- and third-order interatomic force constants are reported in Ref. [27] for silicon,
in Ref. [25] for diamond and in Ref. [69] for graphite.
The LBTE’s scattering matrix Ωνν 0 is computed as in
Ref. [25] and accounts for third-order anharmonicity [32]
and isotopic disorder [141, 142] at natural abundance.
Thermal conductivity and viscosity calculations for silicon and diamond are performed using 27×27×27 q-point
grids and a Gaussian smearing of 2 cm−1 and 8 cm−1 ,
respectively. Thermal conductivity and viscosity calculations for graphite are performed using a 49×49×3 qpoint grid and a Gaussian smearing of 8 cm−1 . The use
of an odd, Gamma-centered q-points mesh is crucial to
correctly account for the parity symmetries of the scattering operator.
