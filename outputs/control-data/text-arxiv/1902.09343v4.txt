In this work, we considered 2 schemes (a high-rigidity break in primary source injections and a
high-rigidity break in diffusion coefficient) to reproduce the newly released AMS-02 nuclei spectra
(He, C, N, O, Li, Be, and B) when the rigidity larger than 50 GV. The fitting results show that
current data set favors a high-rigidity break at ∼ 325 GV in diffusion coefficient rather than a break
at ∼ 365 GV in primary source injections. Meanwhile, the fitted values of the factors to rescale the
cosmic-ray (CR) flux of secondary species/components after propagation show us that the secondary
flux are underestimated in current propagation model. It implies that we might locate in a slow
diffusion zone, in which the CRs propagate with a small value of diffusion coefficient compared with
the averaged value in the galaxy. Another hint from the fitting results show that extra secondary
CR nuclei injection may be needed in current data set. All these new hints should be paid more
attention in future research.

INTRODUCTION

Cosmic-ray (CR) physics has entered a precisiondriven era (see, e.g., Niu and Li [1]). More and more
fine structures have been revealed by a new generation
of space-borne and ground-based experiments in operation. For nuclei spectra, the most obvious fine structure
is the spectral hardening at ∼ 300 GV, which was observed by ATIC-2 [2], CREAM [3], PAMELA [4], and
AMS-02 [5, 6].
Recently released AMS-02 nuclei spectra have confirmed that the spectral hardening exists not only in the
primary CR nuclei species (He, C, and O [7]), but also
in the secondary CR nuclei species (Li, Be, and B [8])
and hybrid nuclei species (N[9] [10]). This provides us
an excellent opportunity to study the spectral hardening
and the physics behind it quantitatively.
Some solutions are proposed to explain this observed
phenomenon: (i) adding a new break in high-rigidity region (∼ 300 GV) to the primary source injection spectra (see, e.g., Korsmeier and Cuoco [11], Boschini et al.
[12], Niu et al. [13], Niu et al. [14], Zhu et al. [15], Niu
et al. [16]); (ii) adding a new high-rigidity break in the
diffusion coefficient (see, e.g., Niu et al. [16], Génolini
et al. [17]); (iii) inhomogeneous diffusion (see, e.g., Blasi
et al. [18], Tomassetti [19, 20, 21], Feng et al. [22], Guo
and Yuan [23]); (iv) the superposition of local and distant
sources (see, e.g., Vladimirov et al. [24], Bernard et al.
[25], Thoudam and Hörandel [26], Tomassetti and Donato [27], Kachelrieß et al. [28], Kawanaka and Yanagita
[29]).
The above explanations could be divided into two
classes at first step: (i), (ii), and (iii), which ascribe
the spectral hardening to non-local source effects; (iv),
which ascribes it to the contribution of local sources. At
second step, the first class of the first step could also be
divided into two sub-classes: (i), which ascribes the spec-

tral hardening to the primary source injections; (ii) and
(iii), which ascribe it to the propagation processes. If the
spectral hardening comes from the CR sources, the ratio
between secondary and primary species’ spectra should
appear featureless (or the primary and secondary spectra
are equally hardened), since the secondary CR spectra
inherit the features from the primary CR spectra. On
the other hand, if the spectral hardening is due to the
propagation processes, the ratio between secondary and
primary species’ spectra should be featured because the
secondary species spectra not only inherit the hardening
from the primary species (which is caused by the propagation of primary species), but are also hardened by their
own propagation processes. This lead to a harder ”tail”
in CR secondary nuclei spectra than previous case (see,
e.g., Fig. 2 in Niu et al. [16]). In this sense, (ii) and (iii)
should have a similar prediction on the spectral hardening in primary and secondary nuclei spectra (see, e.g.,
Niu et al. [16], Feng et al. [22]).
As a result, in this work, we design 2 schemes to test
the origin of the spectra hardening in CR nuclei spectra: (a) the spectral hardening comes from the sources,
which can be described by a high-rigidity break in the
primary source injections (Scheme I); (b) the spectral
hardening comes from the propagation processes, which
can be described by a high-rigidity break in the diffusion
coefficient (Scheme II). Both of the schemes are implemented by the public code galprop v56[30] to reproduce
the AMS-02 nuclei spectra in the global fitting. We hope
that the AMS-02 data could give us a clear quantitative
evidence to the origin of the spectral hardening in CR
nuclei species.

SETUPS

As the framework has been established in our previous works [1, 13, 14, 16], we employ a Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm [31] which is embedded by galprop to do global fitting. The diffusionreacceleration model is used as the unique propagation

2
model in this work. A uniform diffusion coefficient which
depends on CR particles’ rigidity is used in the whole
propagation region. The propagation region is assumed
to have a cylindrical symmetry and a free escape boundary condition. The radial (r) and vertical (z) grid steps
are chosen as ∆r = 1 kpc, and ∆z = 0.2 kpc. The grid in
kinetic energy per nucleon is logarithmic between 1 GeV
and 104 GeV with a step factor of 1.2. The nuclear network used in our calculations is extended to silicon-28.
Some of the most important setups which are different
from our previous work [16] are listed as follows (more
detailed similar configurations could be found in Niu and
Li [1], Niu et al. [16]):
(1) In this work, we do not use the proton and antiproton spectra in our global fitting. On the one hand,
there is an obvious difference observed in the slopes
of proton and other nuclei species when Z > 1 [5–7],
which might indicate a different origin of the spectral hardening between proton and other primary
CR species and needs to study independently. On
the other hand, the spectrum of antiproton is dominately determined by proton spectrum, and might
include some extra sources (like dark matter, see,
e.g., Cui et al. [32], Cuoco et al. [33]). Excluding
these data would help us to focus on the main aims
of this work and avoid some unknown bias in the
global fitting.
(2) The CR nuclei spectra are seriously influenced by
solar modulation when the rigidity below 30 - 40
GV. Moreover, Aguilar et al. [34] has proved that
the CR spectra of proton and helium are varying in
solar cycle 24 when R . 40 GV. At the same time,
in AMS-02 nuclei spectra, data points from 1 GV
to 30 GV always have small uncertainties, which
seriously influence the global fitting results. Consequently, we use the data points above 50 GV to do
the global fitting, which could avoid the influences
from low-rigidity data points and solar modulation
model, and concentrate on the spectral hardening
in high-rigidity region.
(3) Some of the free parameters which are not directly
related to the high-rigidity spectra are removed or
fixed as the best-fit values in our previous work
[16]. In detail, the low-rigidity slopes and breaks
in primary source injections, all the solar modulation potentials (φi s), and all the parameters directly related to proton and antiproton spectra are
removed. D0 (the normalization of the diffusion
coefficient), zh (the half-height of the propagation
region), and vA (the Alfven velocity) are fixed.
(4) In this work, all the nuclei spectra data in the global
fitting comes from AMS-02, which could avoid the
complicities to combine the systematics from different experiments.
(5) In this work, the nitrogen spectrum (which is
thought to be contributed both by primary and

secondary components) is employed in the global
fitting.

where i denotes the species of nuclei, Ni is the normalization constant proportional to the relative abundance

have the same value of injection parameters.
For Scheme II, we have
qi = Ni × R−ν A

(4)

which are described by a power law with an index ν A .
In galprop, the primary source isotopic abundances
are determined by fitting to the data from ACE at about
200 MeV/nucleon, based on a special propagation model
[35, 36]. But this appears some discrepancies when fit to
some new data (see, e.g., Jóhannesson et al. [37]), which
covers high-energy regions. Consequently, in both of the
pri
pri
pri
2 schemes, cpri
He , cC , cN , and cO are employed to rescale
the default abundances of helium-4 (7.199×104 ), carbon12 (2.819×103 ), nitrogen-14 (1.828×102 ), and oxygen-16
(3.822 × 103 ). [38]
At the same time, some works (see, e.g., Niu and Li
[1], Niu et al. [16]) show that if one wants to fit the CR

3
secondary spectra successfully, one should employ factors
to rescale the flux of them after propagation. For antiproton, this factor is always in the region 0.8-1.9 [1, 39, 40],
and always interpreted as the uncertainties from the antiproton production cross section [41–44]. In our previous
work [16], we found that all these factors are systematically larger than 1.0. This confirmed the necessity to
employ them in the global fitting and lead us to find the
physics behind them. Consequently, in this work, csec

FITTING RESULTS

As in our previous works [1, 13, 14, 16], the MCMC
algorithm is employed to determine the posterior probability distribution of the parameters (see in Tables I and
I) in Scheme I and II. The best-fit results of all the employed nuclei spectra for the two schemes are collected in
Fig. 1. The best-fit results and the corresponding residuals (represented by σeff ) of the primary nuclei species
for the two schemes are given in the Fig. 2, that of
the secondary and hybrid nuclei species are shown in
Figs. 3 and 4. For the best-fit results of the global fitting, we get χ2 /d.o.f = 108.97/201 for Scheme I and
χ2 /d.o.f = 96.16/201 for Scheme II.
Note that in the lower panel of sub-figures in Figs. 2,
3, and 4, the σeff is defined as
fobs − fcal
,
σeff = q
2
2
σstat
+ σsys

(5)

where fobs and fcal are the points which come from the
observation and model calculation; σstat and σsys are the
statistical and systematic standard deviations of the observed points. This quantity could clearly show us the
deviations between the best-fit result and observed values at each point based on its uncertainty. Considering
the correlations between different parameters, we could
not get a reasonable reduced χ2 for each part of the data
set independently. As a result, we present the χ2 for each
part of the data set in Figs. 2, 3, and 4.
Generally speaking, all the nuclei spectra can be well
fitted in 2 schemes (the largest deviation is smaller than

3σ, see in Figs. 2, 3, and 4.). Because the 2 schemes have
a same data set and number of parameters, they have the
same degree of freedom and can be compared directly by
χ2 . From the best-fit results, we get ∆χ2 = χ2I − χ2II =
12.81, which is a decisive evidence[45] of indicating that
the current data set favors the Scheme II. Considering
the traditional simple assumptions in Scheme I and II
(assuming a simple broken power-law for injection spectra, a uniform isotropic diffusion coefficient in the whole
propagation region, etc.), we could not get a definite conclusion that the origin of the spectral hardening in nuclei spectra comes from the propagation processes, but
at least it shows a tendency that current data set favors
a high-rigidity break in the diffusion coefficient. More
precise spectra date points in high rigidity (≥ 2 TV), especially that of the secondary nuclei species, could give
us more concrete conclusions.
The boxplot[46] for the ci s in this work are shown in
the lower panels of Fig. 5. For comparison, the corresponding results of our previous work [16], in which the
entire AMS-02 nuclei data (including the data points <
50 GV) is used in the global fitting, are shown in the upper panels in Fig. 5. We want to emphasize that in both
of these works, all the nuclei spectra are considered in
a self-consistent way and all of them are related to each
other intrinsically. The fitting results clearly show that
we could not reproduce the spectra of secondary species
self-consistently without the employment of csec
i s. Consec
sequently, all the fitting results of cpri
s
and
c
i s should
i
be taken seriously. In Fig. 5, it is clearly shown that,
same as that in previous work, no matter in Scheme I or
II, the values of cpri
i s are systematically smaller than 1.0,
while the values of csec
i s are systematically larger than 1.0.
Moreover, the values of cpri
i s in this work are almost the
same as that in previous work if we have considered the
fitting uncertaintes, while the values of csec
i s in this work
are systematically larger than that in previous work.
As the nuclear charge number increases, both cpri
i s and
pri
sec
sec
ci s have smaller values except cN and cBe , respectively.
Because the CR spectrum of nitrogen is composed by
both primary and secondary components and has relative large fitting uncertainties, we will not focus on the
sec
value of cpri
N in this work. From the point view of ci s,
beryllium is the most special CR secondary species.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

In this work, we considered 2 schemes to reproduce
the newly released AMS-02 nuclei spectra (He, C, N, O,
Li, Be, and B) when R > 50 GV. The fitting results
show that current data set favors a high-rigidity break
at ∼ 325 GV in diffusion coefficient rather than a break
at ∼ 365 GV in primary source injections, which is consistent with the results obtained in Génolini et al. [17].
Moreover, the fitted values of cpri
i s (which are the factors
to rescale the default isotopic abundances of helium-4,

carbon-12, nitrogen-14, and oxygen-16 in galprop) are
systematically smaller than 1.0 and consistent with the
results in our previous work [16] within fitting uncertainties. While the fitted values of csec
i s (which are the factors
to rescale the CR flux of secondary species/components
after propagation) are systematically larger than 1.0 and
larger than the values obtained in our previous work [16],
which includes the entire spectra data points in the global
fitting.
In some of the previous works (see, e.g., Niu and Li
[1], Niu et al. [13], Niu et al. [14], Lin et al. [39], Lin
et al. [40], Yuan et al. [47]), the p̄ rescale factor csec
p̄ always have a value of ∼ 1.3, which has been explained to
approximate the ratio of antineutron-to-antiproton production cross section [44]. Similarly, all the other csec
i s
could be interpreted as the same origins. However, generally speaking, the production cross sections of these
secondary species are energy dependent. In Figs. 1, 2, 3,
and 4, one can find that the fitting results are quit well

in most of the cases. If this is the right explanation, it
is quit unnatural that all these secondary species have
energy independent corrections on their production cross
sections. On the other hand, it is also quit unnatural
that all the production cross sections of these secondary
species have been underestimated simultaneously. As a
result, this explanation could be excluded to some extend. At least, it could not be the dominate factor.
According to observing the extended emission around
Geminga and PSR B0656+14 pulsar wind nebulae
(PWNe), Abeysekara et al. [48] have found that the estimated CR diffusion coefficient (D0 ) are more than two
orders of magnitude smaller than the typical value derived from the secondary/primary nuclei species in galactic CRs. It infers that there exists slower diffusion zone
(SDZ) around PWN, which could be extended to CR
sources [49]. Some previous works [50, 51] show that
positron excess in CRs could be explained by this twozone model. If we locate in such a SDZ [52], a smaller

D0 can lead to produce more secondary nuclei species’
flux than the uniform diffusion in the whole galaxy. This
could be the solution to the underestimation of secondary
flux in current model.
Meanwhile, the csec
i s in current work (averaged from
50 GV to 2 TV ) are systematically larger than that in
our previous work (averaged from 2 GV to 2 TV), which
implies that it needs more secondary CR particles in high

energy region to meet the observed data.[53] If it is the
case, one needs extra injection of secondary nuclei species
in high energy region. This scenario is recently studied
by some interesting works (see, e.g., Yang and Aharonian
[54] and Boschini et al. [55]).
In summary, we could ascribe the underestimation of
the CR secondary flux to the SDZ which we locate in.
At the same time, another hint implies it might need

A box plot or boxplot is a method for graphically depicting groups of numerical data through their quartiles.
In our configurations, the band inside the box shows the
median value of the dataset, the box shows the quartiles,
and the whiskers extend to show the rest of the distribution which are edged by the 5th percentile and the 95th
percentile.
