Complete measurements, while providing maximal information gain, results in destruction of the shared
entanglement. In the standard teleportation scheme, the sender’s measurement on the shared entangled state
between the sender and the receiver has that consequence. We propose here a teleportation scheme involving
weak measurements which can sustain entanglement upto a certain level so that the reusability of the shared
resource state is possible. The measurements are chosen in such a way that it is weak enough to retain entanglement and hence can be reused for quantum tasks, yet adequately strong to ensure quantum advantage in the
protocol. In this scenario, we report that at most six sender-receiver duos can reuse the state, when the initial
shared state is entangled in a finite neighborhood of the maximally entangled state and for a suitable choice
of weak measurements. However, we observe that the reusability number decreases with the decrease in the
entanglement of the initial shared state. Among the weakening strategies studied, Bell measurement admixed
with white noise performs better than any other low-rank weak measurements in this situation.

INTRODUCTION

Over the last decade, it has been established that next generation communication technology can be revolutionised by employing laws of quantum theory. In this regard, the invention
of quantum teleportation [1] has played a crucial role in the
advancement of quantum communication. It is a protocol by
which one can send the information in a quantum state to a remote party without sending the system itself physically. After
the initial proposal, several attempts have been made to generalize it, which include construction of the optimal teleportation protocol for a general resource state [2], characterization
of its performance via both fidelity and its deviation [3, 4], understanding the relation between entanglement of the resource
state and the fidelity [2], extension to continuous variable systems [5, 6], teleportation in a multiparty setting [7, 8]. On the
other hand, based on the teleportation protocol, many other
quantum tasks like quantum repeaters [9], quantum gate teleportation [10], measurement-based computing [11] have been
designed which facilitate the progress of quantum information
and communication. Relaizations of these tasks in various
physical systems, like photonic qubits [12–15], nuclear magnetic resonance [16], trapped ions [17, 18] play a key role in
the developments of quantum communication (cf. [19–21]).
Recently, long-distance teleportation using photons has also
been achieved between two cities which are at a distance of a
thousand kilometers [14].
Information cannot, in general, be gained through quantum
measurement without disturbing the system [22]. Typically, in
a teleportation protocol, a shared state acting as a channel can
be used only once if the task is performed employing a complete projective measurement. This is due to the fact that in
this scenario, quantum correlations present in the channel or in
the resource state between the sender and the receiver is completely destroyed after the measurement. In this respect, one
can ask the following question: If the sender does not perform
a (complete) projective measurement, can the resource state
remain useful by saving part of its entanglement content, for

possible utilization in the future round? To address it, nonprojective measurements or weak or unsharp measurements
[23] can be carried out, which disturb the state less at the cost
of a reduced information gain, thereby creating a trade-off between measurement disturbance and information gain. Note
that although the joint measurement and the channel are both
key elements in teleportation, the role of the former is less
studied than that of the latter on the performance of the protocol [24].
In this work, we investigate different weak measurement
strategies, which are a class of positive operator-valued measurements (POVMs) to achieve reusability for maximal number of times of a fixed teleportation channel, with the maximal
number being referred to as the maximal reusability number
(MRN). Such a reusability number is computed by maintaining the teleportation fidelity beyond the classical one at each
round. Specifically, when the standard Bell measurement is
weakened by admixing it with white noise and for a shared
maximally entangled state as a resource, we report that the
channel can be used at most six times, while still attaining
quantum advantage in the teleportation protocol. This kind of
weakening is known to optimize information gain-disturbance
in case of two outcome measurements [25]. It is interesting to
note that in case of violation of Bell inequalities by multiple observers on one side, at most two observers can violate
the inequality [26], and in case of witnessing entanglement
in the same scenario, at most twelve observers can detect bipartite entanglement, with another observer situated at a distant location [27]. Therefore, the results here indicate that
the multiple-round teleportation fidelity with weak measurements has apparently an intermediate standing between Bell
inequality violation and sharing of entanglement. This is in
sharp contrast to the situation while using complete projective measurements, as then, entanglement and teleportation fidelity vanish together for two-qubit states, while Bell inequality violation is absent in a larger class. See [28] in this respect.
We also find that the number, six, remains unaltered even for
non-maximally entangled states having entanglement beyond
a certain critical value. For a fixed measurement scheme, we

2
observe that MRN decreases with the decrease of entanglement of the shared state at each round although a plateau with
respect to the content of entanglement is found for a fixed
value of MRN. Moreover, we extend our study to other prototypical weak measurements. For example, a specific Bell
state smeared by mixing states from its support or from orthogonal support leads to a lower value of MRN, thereby a
weaker value of the corresponding entanglement, compared
to the case of Bell measurement with white noise.
This paper is organized in the following way. In Sec. II, we
first describe the standard teleportation protocol with projective measurements, and then introduce the concept of teleportation via weak measurements which helps us to answer the
main question of reusability of the resource state. With different weak measurement strategies, we present the analysis of
reusability when the resource state is maximally entangled in
Sec. III, while investigation for other non-maximally entangled resource state is carried out in Sec. IV. We summarize
our results in Sec. V.

METHODOLOGY: REUSING THE RESOURCE

Before introducing the protocol which enables reusability
of the resource, let us first briefly discuss the standard teleportation protocol, which in turn guide us to the construction of
the new one. Let us consider a state, ρAB , shared between two
parties, say, Alice (A) and Bob (B). Alice wants to teleport
an arbitrary single qubit state,
A0

|ηi
2

= a|0i + b|1i,

(1)

2

with |a| + |b| = 1 to Bob. The initial state then reads as
0

0

ρA AB = |ηiA hη| ⊗ ρAB ,

(2)

In this scenario, A performs a joint (complete) projective mea0
surement on the A0 A part of ρA AB and communicates classically the measurement results to B who acts locally according
to A’s communication to reproduce the input. The objective
of the protocol is to maximize the fidelity, f , where maximization is performed over all operations allowed in the protocol
by A and B, averaged over all input states to be teleported to
B and is given by
Z
f=
hη|ρB |ηid|ηi,
(3)
|ηi
B

where ρ is the reduced density matrix of B after all operations performed by A and B. When the resource state is a
general two qubit mixed state, the optimal teleportation protocol and the corresponding fidelity are derived in Refs. [2, 3].
Specifically, if the resource state is Bell diagonal [29], the teleportation protocol, involving Bell basis measurements in A0 A
and Pauli rotations at B, yields the optimal fidelity. It is also
known that for an arbitrary shared separable state, the fidelity
is 2/3, which we refer as the classical one. Note here that the
attainment of the maximal fidelity would result in the complete destruction of the resource (entanglement) between A
and B. Therefore, in this communication scheme, there is no

possibility of reusing the resource in the teleportation channel, i.e., the shared state.

A.

Prescription for reusing resource state with weak
measurements

In this paper, we consider a shift in “paradigm” for teleportation protocols, from ones which strive to maximize the
fidelity, to those whose objective is to reuse the resource state
for maximal number of rounds, while ensuring the fidelity at
each round to be nonclassical [30], i.e., f > 2/3. We demonstrate that Alice can achieve this by shifting from the projective measurement strategy to one that employs weak (unsharp)
measurements [23]. Such measurements can be described by
a set of POVMs, {Mi }, such that
X
Mi = I and Mi ≥ 0 ∀i.
(4)
i

After the weak joint measurement by A, the measurement
results are classically communicated to B, who now has two
choices (see Fig. 1):
1. B can complete the teleportation process by applying
appropriate unitary operators depending on the measurement outcome.
2. B does nothing and leaves the protocol, allowing for a
new pair of A and B to reuse the remaining resource (if
any) to teleport in the next round at some later time.
If B declines to complete the teleportation in the first round,
the new B has exactly the same two options after the measurement in the second round. Similar situation occurs for all
successive rounds. Note, however, that this is not an indefinite process. The finiteness of the maximal number of rounds
is induced by the fact that the completion of the protocol at

3
any given intermediate round would have to yield a nonclassical teleportation fidelity, thereby requiring an entangled state
shared by A and B. Therefore, finding the maximal number of
reusability of a given channel is one of the main goals of our
work. We call this number as the maximal reusability number.
It is a function of the teleportation protocol employed, including the shared state, the measurements at Alice’s lab and the
unitary operations at Bob’s lab.
Nevertheless, the post measurement state when the i-th
POVM element, Mi , clicks can be expressed as

and the corresponding fidelity is given in Eq. (3). If B refuses
to complete the protocol, the effective state shared between
A and B for subsequent rounds is obtained by tracing out A0

For a given shared state, the above steps can be repeated to

Weakening Bell measurements via depolarization

Instead of performing Bell basis measurement, Alice ap0

plies POVMs, {MA

by mixing Bell measurements with a completely depolarizing
(maximally mixed) state. The i-th element of POVM can be

where λ1 ∈ (0, 1] is the sharpness parameter and |BiA A i
is one of the Bell states. Note that λ1 = 1 corresponds to
the projective measurement. The initial state on which the
0
0
measurement has to be performed is |ψ A AB i = |ηiA ⊗
AB
|B1 i. Now following the strategy developed in Sec. II, B
might wish to complete the teleportation process and acts his
qubit with Pauli operators just as in the standard teleportation
scheme. The resulting post measurement state with B is then
given by

(11)
= λ1 |ηihη| +

Hence the corresponding fidelity, following Eq. (3), reads as
Z
1 + λ1
f (1, λ1 ) =
hη|ρB |ηi d|ηi =

(12)

|ηi
where “1” and “λ1 ” in the arguments refer to the initial maximally entangled state, which can be thought of as a Werner

state, p|B1AB ihB1AB | + 1−p
4 I4 , with p = 1, and the sharpness parameter of the POVM respectively. Note f1 (1, λ) > 23
for λ > 31 .
On the other hand, B might not want to go on with the
teleportation protocol at this round and therefore, does nothing. In this situation, the effective state shared between A
and B is computed by performing averages over all the postmeasurement states after the POVMs and over all possible input states, |ηi. If the initial shared state is |B1AB i and the
0
A
POVMs are of the form {MA
}, the resulting state for the
i
i-th outcome is the Werner state, given by
ρAB (1, λ1 ) = p(λ1 )|B1AB ihB1AB | +

MAXIMALLY ENTANGLED STATE AS THE INITIAL

shared between Alice and Bob, given by
|B1AB i



(9)

as the initial resource to compute MRN for different choices
of weak measurement strategies. |B1 i is one of the triplets in
the Bell basis [31] and the results obtained by using this state
will be same for any other shared maximally entangled states.

Here in ρAB (1, λ1 ), arguments have the same meaning as in
f (1, λ1 ). It is known that the state is entangled for p > 31 .
Note that if A and B now use ρAB (1, λ1 ) as the initial resource state and A decides to perform the projective measurement, the maximal teleportation fidelity after the second round
turns out to be f (p(λ1 ), λ2 = 1) = (1 + p(λ1 ))/2, where λ2
is the sharpness parameter of the second round measurement.

It is greater than 2/3 when λ1 < 13 (1+ 3) ≈ 0.9107. There√
fore, we find a range 13 < λ1 < 13 (1 + 3) for which both
the fidelities, f (1, λ1 ) and f (p(λ1 ), λ2 = 1), obtained in the
first round by weak measurement and second round by projective measurement respectively are greater than the classical
bound of 2/3, thereby confirming the plausibility of reusing
the shared resource state.

Let us now consider the case when a fixed value of fidelity,

Lemma 3. When a Werner state of probability p0 is used as
the resource and a weak Bell measurement (Eq. (10)), of
sharpness λ0 is performed, the effective state, ρAB (p0 , λ0 ),

state remains an Werner state with updatation of mixing probability.
By recursion, we obtain that if the initial resource state is
|B1AB i and n-rounds of POVMs are performed on A0 A with
sharpness values λ1 , λ2 ...λn−1 , the resulting state for the i-th
outcome takes the form as
ρAB (pλn1 ,...,λn−1 , λ1 , λ2 , ..., λn−1 ) =

λ ,...,λn−1
λ ,...,λn−1
f (pn1
, λ1 , λ2 , ..., λn−1 ) = 12 (1 + pn1
). Applying these lemmas, we now state the following result.
Theorem 1. If a maximally entangled state is used as the initial resource,
MRNf =2/3 (|B1AB i) = 6,

(29)

where MRNf =2/3 denotes the fact that MRN is computed for
a fixed value of fidelity to be 2/3.
Proof. When a weak Bell measurement of sharpness λ0 is employed, the effective state for a maximally entangled resource,
|B1AB i, is a Werner state with a probability, p(λ0 ), as in Eq.
(13). On the other hand, by substituting ΛB = 21 IB
2 in Eq.
(19) of Lemma 2, we realize the effective state for the next
round when 14 IAB
is used as a resource is 14 IAB
itself. There4
4
fore, when a Werner state of probability p0 is used as a resource and a weak Bell measurement of sharpness λ0 is performed, the effective state for the next round, by linearity is
computed as

Naturally, any other Bell state, |BiAB i, would have the same
MRN value.
If the fidelity for each round is fixed to a value f > 23 , the
maximal number of times, MRNf , that one can continue the
process, for an initial maximally entangled resource is given
in Table I (see Fig. 2). Moreover, the effective state between
A and B in the (MRNf + 1) − th round can still be entangled,
i.e., can be used for teleportation with quantum fidelity lower
than the prescribed fidelity f . We compute these ranges and
note them down in Table I.

each round is fixed to be f . fent denotes the fidelity for a given
MRNf such that the effective state for the next round, i.e., (MRNf +
1)th round, is entangled but not enough to achieve the required fidelity f .

Among the various ranges and critical values of f obtained in Table I, we want to highlight two points: Firstly,
for MRNf = 6, the effective state for the next round is always
unentangled. This is expected since the highest value of MRN
is six (see Eq. (29)), and existence of any entangled effective
state in the seventh round would imply MRN to be greater than
six. Secondly, if the√fidelity requirement at the first round is
greater than 61 (4 + 3) ≈ 0.9553, the state cannot be reused
at all. This simply follows from the fact that the effective state
for the second
√ round becomes unentangled when the required
f > 16 (4 + 3). To obtain such fidelity one has to perform
√
a measurement with sharpness λ > 13 (1 + 3) ≈ 0.9107 resulting in a Werner state with p ≤ 13 , an unentangled one (see
Eq. (14)), as the effective state for the next round.
In the next section we would discuss other possible channels by which Bell measurements can be weakened. We show
that among these possible weakening paths, the one considered in this section is the best for obtaining values of MRN.

which reduces to Eq. (30) with µ = 1+λ
2 . If we now use the
strategy developed in the previous sections to investigate the
fidelity and possibility of reusability of a maximally entangled
resource subjected to weak measurements given in Eq. (30),
we find the fidelity of the first round to be
fphase-flip (λ) =

1
(1 + 2λ),
3

(32)

where fphase-flip (λ) > 32 for λ > 12 . However, the effective
state shared between Alice and Bob after the first round is diagonal and hence unentangled, which curbs the possibility of
reusability of the resource state. Thus, weakening Bell measurements by mixing states from the same Schmidt support
does not provide reusability even for a maximally entangled
resource. In the next section, we consider other weakening
schemes which in some cases enable reusability.

Weakening Bell measurements via local strategies

Apart from the weakening strategies adopted in Eq. (10),
there can be other ways by which Bell measurements can
be weakened. We deal with some of these other weakening
schemes in this section. Firstly, we consider POVMs by mixing Bell states with states from its “Schmidt support”, i.e.,
the span of the Schmidt vectors of the same. We find that,
under such a scheme reusabilty of resource states is not possible. Then we consider cases which weakens the Bell measurements by mixing states from beyond its Schmidt support.
Although in some cases, reusability is possible, but among
the considered weakening scenarios, the POVMs in Eq. (10)
gives the best MRN when a maximally entangled state is used
as the initial resource state.

1.

Mixing states from the same Schmidt support

When Bell states are weakened by mixing states from
the same Schmidt support, we effectively get POVMs

2.

Mixing states from the entire space

Let us now consider two distinct strategies where the Bell
measurements are weakened by mixing states from different
Schmidt supports, i.e., {B1 , B2 } group elements are weakened by mixing states from the {B3 , B4 } group and viceversa. Such POVM elements can be obtained when a local bitflip channel acts on A0 . The resulting i-th element of POVM
takes the form

Using these POVMs, the fidelity obtained after the first round

NON-MAXIMALLY ENTANGLED STATE AS INITIAL
RESOURCE

In this section, instead of maximally entangled state as resource, we consider arbitrary pure state shared between A and
B under the same measurement strategies, discussed in Sec.
III. We are now interested to investigate the change in the
reusability number with the variation of entanglement content
of the resource state. Any pure bipartite state can always be
written as
√
√
|χAB i = α|00i + 1 − α|11i,
(41)

where α ∈ (0, 1). To teleport |ηiA , the POVMs for weak
Bell measurements described in Eq. (10) is performed on the
0
0
A0 A party of the input state |ξiA AB = |ηiA ⊗ |χAB i. According to the protocol described in SubSec. II A, if B wishes
to complete the teleportation process by applying the proper
unitaries based on the measurement outcomes, then the corresponding fidelity in the first round by averaging over all input

states |ηiA is given by
fα (1, λ1 ) =

if B is indifferent and leaves the protocol, the effective state

where p(λ1 ) is same as in Eq. (14). Clearly, the effective state,
in Eq. (43), is an X state, which reduces to a Werner state for
α = 1/2, i.e. for maximally entangled state. The teleportation
fidelity of an X state of the form in Eq. (43) after performing
the weak Bell measurements is computed in the lemma stated
below.

Lemma 2 that an X state of the form in Eq. (43) will be
an X state of the same form after performing the weak Bell
measurements. However, the change in probability of X state
for the next round, p0 p(λ0 ), follows from Lemma 3.

Lemma 4. The teleportation fidelity of an X state with probability p0 ,

Using the above two lemmas, we can compute the fidelity
and the effective state for any subsequent round when a pure
non-maximally entangled bipartite state, Eq. (41), is shared
between A and B as an initial resource, and POVMs in Eq.
(10) is performed at each step. Now we compute the MRNf
for |χiAB with various values of α by fixing the fidelity f
at each round. See Table II for the ranges of α which yield
a given value of MRN. Obviously for α = 1/2, |χAB i is
maximally entangled, and for that, we have already shown
the MRNf =2/3 to be six. The sharpness parameters which
provide f = 2/3 in each round follows a recursion relation:

1 − p0

2

(45)

where the expression of fα (1, λ0 ) is expressed in Eq. (42).
Proof. We proceed in a similar fashion as in Lemma 1. The

|χiAB hχ| part of ρAB
α (p ) yields a fidelity of fα (1, λ ) on being subjected to weak Bell measurements with sharpness λ0 .

From our analysis with non-maximally entangled pure

is preserved also in the range α ∈ (0.3008, 0.5] (see Table II
and Fig. 4), which implies that the non-maximally entangled
states (of course within a particular range) is in the same footing with the maximally entangled one, in terms of the maximal number of reusability of the shared state. The maximal
reusability number decreases with the decreasing value of α.
See Table II for MRNf values with respect to α.

Unutilized entanglement of X states: In case of a nonmaximally entangled initial resource, the effective state for the
subsequent rounds are X states for which the projective Bell
measurements as well as the Pauli unitary operators are not
optimal. Consequently, performing the Werner-type POVM,
i.e. the weak Bell measurements in Eq. (10) over the X
states only gives a bound to the maximal fidelity for a given
sharpness parameter. An upshot of the above analysis is reflected in the fact that for a non-maximally entangled initial
resource, some entangled effective states in the next round,
with MRNf ≤ 5, do not yield quantum fidelities, i.e., cannot
be used to increase MRNf =2/3 following our strategy. However, some amount of entanglement still exists which can be
used to obtain nonclassical fidelity in a teleportation scheme
with other choices of measurements and unitaries. In Fig. 4,
the dark (red) and grey (green) lines correspond to the separable and entangled regions (measured by concurrence), respectively, for a certain range of α. Interestingly, we find that
when MRN = 6, all the effective states for different values of
α become separable and hence are useless for teleportation.

CONCLUSION

Teleportation is one of the most fascinating inventions in
quantum theory. It has been experimentally verified and now
with the satellite-based technology in the field, teleportation
is marching fast in the direction of being realized on an intercontinental scale.
We addressed the issue of whether the resource state for
teleportation can further be used by another set of senderreceiver pair by using suitable sets of weak measurements,
while maintaining nonclassical fidelities at every round of
the use. Reusability was achieved by not employing complete projective measurements which fully destroy the resource state after the very first use of the channel. We observed that the sharpness of the measurements must be tuned
in an appropriate manner so that it is weak enough to allow
reusability, yet adequately strong to guarantee quantum fidelities during every use.
We reported that if a maximally entangled state is the initial resource, reuse of the resource is possible at most six
times after applying the weak Bell measurements. Precisely,
we compute the maximal reusability number (MRN) for pure
maximally entangled initial resource when the fidelity at each
round is just beyond the classically achievable fidelity. Moreover, we found that among several weak measurement strategies, the one constructed by mixing Bell states with white
noise led to a higher value of MRN compared to other weakening measurement schemes. Interestingly, the MRN turned
out to be six even for non-maximally entangled state having
entanglement as measured by concurrence, higher than 0.91
ebits. We also studied the trends of MRN with the entanglement content of the resource state and the sharpness parameter
of the measurement.
The performance of quantum teleportation protocol was traditionally quantified via single-shot fidelity. Naturally, when
reusability is demanded, the scheme has to be redesigned to
incorporate both MRN which involve measurement as well as
state parameters and the fidelity at every round for characterization. In this paper, we prescribe ‘a strategy’ to meet both
the demand for reusing the initial resource state and the same
for nonclassical fidelities. Our work, therefore, opens up a
new window of plausibility where for a fixed channel, one can
extract quantum advantage in teleportation for several rounds
and can address the trade-off between information gain and
disturbance due to measurement, operationally.
