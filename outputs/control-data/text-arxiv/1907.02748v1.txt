The decays of the β-delayed neutron emitters 137 I and 95 Rb have been studied with the total
absorption γ-ray spectroscopy technique. The purity of the beams provided by the JYFLTRAP
Penning trap at the ion guide isotope separator on-line facility in Jyväskylä allowed us to carry out
a campaign of isotopically pure measurements with the decay total absorption γ-ray spectrometer,
a segmented detector composed of eighteen NaI(Tl) modules. The contamination coming from the
interaction of neutrons with the spectrometer has been carefully studied, and we have tested the use
of time differences between prompt γ-rays and delayed neutron interactions to eliminate this source
of contamination. Due to the sensitivity of our spectrometer, we have found a significant amount
of β-intensity to states above the neutron separation energy that de-excite by γ-rays, comparable
to the neutron emission probability. The competition between γ de-excitation and neutron emission has been compared with Hauser-Feshbach calculations, and it can be understood as a nuclear
structure effect. In addition, we have studied the impact of the β-intensity distributions determined
in this work on reactor decay heat and reactor antineutrino spectrum summation calculations. The
robustness of our results is demonstrated by a thorough study of uncertainties, and with the reproduction of the spectra of the individual modules and the module-multiplicity gated spectra. This
work represents the state-of-the-art of our analysis methodology for segmented total absorption
spectrometers.

INTRODUCTION

Neutron-rich nuclei far from stability may exhibit βdecay energy windows Qβ larger than the neutron separation energy Sn in the daughter nucleus. In those cases

with Qβ > Sn , neutron emission competes strongly with
γ-ray emission in the de-excitation of excited levels populated above Sn in the β-decay. This decay mode, known
as β-delayed neutron emission, was discovered in 1939
by Roberts et al. [1] and becomes dominant when the
neutron excess is sufficiently large.
The β-delayed neutron emission process plays an important role in stellar nucleosynthesis. Heavy nuclei
beyond iron can be produced by means of the rapidneutron-capture process, the so-called r-process [2]. The
main characteristic of the r-process is the availability of
a large number of neutrons that are added in a short
time interval to elements of the iron group in successive
neutron capture processes followed by β-decays. Very
neutron-rich β-delayed neutron emitters up to very heavy
nuclei are formed in this way. Core collapse supernovae of
massive stars or neutron star mergers have been considered as possible astrophysical sites for the r-process. Recently, the combined detection of gravitational waves and
electromagnetic radiation from the GW170817 neutron
star merger, gave support to the idea that such mergers
are important sources of r-process elements [3].
The detailed study of the r-process requires nuclear
data such as nuclear masses, half-lives (T1/2 ), β-delayed
neutron emission probabilities (Pn ) and neutron capture
(n,γ) reaction cross sections [4] for nuclei far away from
stability. In spite of considerable experimental effort, a
large amount of data is still lacking, and are thus obtained theoretically from nuclear models.
In the case of (n,γ) cross sections, when no experimental information is available, statistical calculations using the Hauser-Feschbach formalism (HFF) [5] are used.
These calculations rely on parameters obtained close
to the valley of β stability for Nuclear Level Densities
(NLD), Photon Strength Functions (PSF) and Neutron
Transmission Coefficients (NTC) [6]. In recent years the
connection between the β-delayed neutron emission process and (n,γ) reactions as a possible source of experimental information has been highlighted [7–10]. In both
processes resonances that decay either by γ or neutron
emission are populated, though they usually have different spin-parity values. The experimental difficulty when
taking advantage of this connection is related to the accurate measurement of the β-intensity followed by γ emission above Sn . Traditional high-resolution experiments
with HPGe detectors have been shown to be limited in
detecting β-intensity at high excitation energies. This is
due to the so-called Pandemonium systematic error [11],
associated with the limited efficiency of such detectors.
The Total Absorption γ-ray Spectroscopy (TAGS) technique allows one to overcome this effect and it has proven
to be capable of extracting the β intensity followed by γrays above Sn in previous works [7, 8, 12, 13]. This technique uses large scintillator crystals covering almost the
full solid angle in order to maximize the γ-detection efficiency. The sum of the γ-rays de-exciting each level fed
in the daughter nucleus is detected, instead of the individual γ-rays. The TAGS technique allows one to obtain

the β-intensity distribution followed by γ-ray emission,
Iβγ , by means of a deconvolution process.
On the other hand, in the case of T1/2 and Pn values,
predictions from QRPA β-strength calculations [14, 15]
have been compared in recent years with experimental
results to test the accuracy of the nuclear models. A
more stringent cross-check implies a comparison of calculated and measured β-strength distributions, since they
are particularly sensitive to the details of the nuclear
model. A key ingredient to determine the β-strength distributions are the β intensity probabilities, which can be
obtained free from the Pandemonium effect with TAGS,
as mentioned above.
The β-decay of fission fragments plays a crucial role
in nuclear reactors, where on average six β-decays follow each fission reaction. A precise knowledge of the
energy released by their radioactive decay, the so-called
Decay Heat (DH), turns out to be important in order to
maintain the safe operation of a reactor after shutdown.
Furthermore it can help to understand the occurrence of
accidents, as shown in the case of the Fukushima-Daiichi
plant [16], a consequence of the non-effective dissipation
of the DH in the reactor core and in the adjacent cooling
pool for spent-fuel. In addition, predictions of the DH
associated with innovative fuels and reactors are needed.
Apart from its importance for the safe operation of
reactors, accurate information on the β-decay of the resulting fission fragments can be used to improve our understanding of the reactor antineutrino spectrum, important for reactor-based antineutrino experiments on fundamental neutrino physics [17–19] and for reactor monitoring [20]. The standard approach used in antineutrino
spectrum calculations is based on the conversion of integral β spectra measurements for the main fissile isotopes
[21, 22]. However, the recent observation of discrepancies
between experimental data and calculations of the absolute flux [23] and shape [24–26] of the reactor antineutrino spectrum, has encouraged further improvements in
the alternative summation approach, which relies on the
information from nuclear databases. In this approach,
the total antineutrino spectrum is calculated as the sum
of the antineutrino spectra associated with the decay of
each fission product weighted by the corresponding activity. The antineutrino spectrum for each decay is constructed by using the β-intensity probabilities. An improvement in the summation method from the point of
view of decay data consists of the provision of data free
from the Pandemonium systematic error [27]. The same
applies for the calculation of the reactor DH, where a
summation over the inventory of fission products provides an alternative to integral measurements. The DH
as a function of time is computed by summing the energy
released by the decay of each nucleus (average γ and β
energies for β-decaying nuclei) weighted by the activity
at this time. For the calculation of the average energies,
the β-intensity distributions are needed, so that the use
of β intensities suffering from Pandemonium limits the
accuracy of such calculations [28].

3
Here we study the decays of two important βdelayed neutron emitters by means of the TAGS
technique: the decay of 137 I (Qβ =6.027 MeV) into
137
Xe (Sn =4.025 MeV), and the decay of 95 Rb
(Qβ =9.228 MeV) into 95 Sr (Sn =4.348 MeV). The decay properties of their respective β-n branches (neutron
emission probability, neutron branching to states in the
final nucleus and neutron spectra) are well known, hence
one can make a detailed study of the neutron/γ competition. 137 I is identified as an important contributor to the
reactor DH and to the reactor antineutrino spectrum. In
fact, a high priority has been assigned to measurements of
this decay with the TAGS technique by the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) [29]. Although 95 Rb has
a smaller contribution to the total decay energy released
in a reactor, its large Qβ value makes it a good candidate
for investigating the Pandemonium systematic error.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section II we
describe the experimental measurements of these decays
and in Section III a detailed discussion of the TAGS analyses will be presented. The competition between neutron
emission and γ-ray emission will be addressed in Section IV. In Section V we compare the β energy spectra
obtained from the results of this work with previous measurements, as well as the new average β and γ energies
with previous values. Finally, in Section VI the impact
of these results in reactor DH and reactor antineutrino
spectrum summation calculations will be discussed.

EXPERIMENT

A campaign of measurements, including 137 I and 95 Rb
decays, was carried out in 2014 at the upgraded Ion
Guide Isotope Separator On-Line (IGISOL) facility at
the University of Jyväskylä [30]. We employed the new
Decay Total Absorption γ-ray Spectrometer (DTAS),
composed of 18 NaI(Tl) crystals [31]. In the set-up a
plastic β detector of 3 mm thickness was located close
to the center of DTAS, and a HPGe detector was placed
behind the β detector. A schematic picture of the set-up
can be seen in Fig. 1. The fission ion guide was used to
extract the nuclei produced by 25 MeV proton-induced
fission on natural uranium. The IGISOL separator magnet was employed to separate the radioactive nuclei based
on their mass to charge ratio before using the double
Penning trap system JYFLTRAP [32] for isobaric separation. The ions extracted from the trap were implanted
on a tape placed in front of the plastic β detector. A
tape transport system was employed to remove the activity from DTAS during the measurements. The collection
cycles of the tape transport system were selected to allow
the reduction of the descendant activity in the measurements. For the decay of 137 I (T1/2 =24.5 s) the collection
cycle was ∼4×T1/2 , while for 95 Rb (T1/2 =377.7 ms) it
was ∼7×T1/2 .

Experimental spectra

A coincidence between DTAS and the β detector was
required to get a spectrum free from environmental background. The total sum energy of DTAS was reconstructed off-line from the signals in the individual modules as described in [33], with threshold values of ∼90
keV for DTAS modules and ∼70 keV for the β detector. Standard calibration sources were used to obtain
the energy and resolution calibration of DTAS (22,24 Na,
60
Co, 137 Cs and 152 Eu-133 Ba) [33]. There are three main
sources of contamination in our TAGS spectra that need
to be corrected: 1) the summing-pileup distortion, 2)
the activity of the descendants and 3) the contribution
of the β-delayed neutrons interacting with the detector.
The first two are discussed here, while the third one is
discussed in subsection II B.
The summing-pileup distortion was calculated as in
previous works [8, 34–36], with a Monte Carlo (MC) procedure based on the random superposition of two stored
events within the ADC gate length [33, 37].
The decay of 137 Xe (T1/2 =3.818 m) was measured and
its contribution to the measurement of 137 I was calculated using the γ transition at 455.5 keV from the decay
of 137 Xe as normalization. In the case of 95 Rb, both the
daughter (95 Sr, with T1/2 =23.90 s) and the granddaughter (95 Y, with T1/2 =10.3 m) contaminate the measurement. Both decays were measured, and their contribu-

β-delayed neutron background

β-delayed neutrons interact with the NaI(Tl) material
of the detector producing γ-rays, either in an inelastic reaction or after neutron capture, that are easily detected
in DTAS. The most clear evidence of these interactions
is a structure in the spectra above 6.8 MeV, mainly due
to neutron capture in the 127 I of the crystals, that can be
seen in Fig. 2. On the other hand, γ-rays from inelastic
scattering, less evident, concentrate at low energy. This
contamination was treated in two different ways. In the
first method it is calculated using dedicated MC simulations. In the second method we exploit the fact that
γ-rays from neutron interactions are delayed, due to the
low velocity of the neutrons, with respect to prompt γrays emitted after the decay.
The simulation of the contamination due to the βn branch was done using the Geant4 simulation code
[38] and the DECAYGEN event generator, as described
in [33]. The generator uses the β-intensity distribution followed by neutron emission, Iβn , that was reconstructed from the measured neutron spectra using the
information on neutron branching ratios to the excited
levels in the final nucleus, In . The neutron spectra are
obtained from ENDF/B-VII.0, based on an evaluation of
experimental data [39]. In the case of 95 Rb the experimental information is completed at high energies with
QRPA and Hauser-Feshbach theoretical calculations [40].
For 137 I the neutron spectrum directly provides Iβn since
neutron emission proceeds to the ground state (g.s.) only.
For 95 Rb there are several measurements of the neutron
branching In to the different levels in 94 Sr [41–43]. The
values quoted in ENSDF come from H. Gabelmann [43].
However, we observe that our experimental spectrum is
compatible with the simulation performed using the intensities coming from the experiment of K.-L. Kratz et
al. [41] but not with the one using In from ENSDF, as
shown in Fig. 2.
As discussed in [33], a 500 ns time window for accumulation of the energy deposited in DTAS was used for
both the experimental spectra and in the MC simulations. This time is enough to allow the full energy deposition of β delayed neutron-induced γ-rays. The simulated
β-n branch has been normalized to match the low-energy
tail of the experimental neutron capture peak (see Fig. 2).
In 95 Rb this normalization matches at the same time the
peak corresponding to the 837 keV γ-ray, emitted from
the first excited state in 94 Sr, which is populated in the
β-n decay (see Fig. 2).
As discussed in [31], one can use the timing information between γ-rays detected in DTAS and β-particles

tion was estimated with the help of the Bateman equations. Contaminant fractions of 3.13% and 0.38% were
calculated for daughter and granddaughter respectively.
The contamination of 95 Y in the measurement of 95 Sr
(3.96%) was also taken into account in the same way.

detected in the plastic scintillation detector in order to
distinguish whether γ-rays are coming from neutron interactions or from the β decay. Time correlation spectra
∆t = tDT AS − tplastic were reconstructed for the individual modules as shown in Fig. 3. For convenience the
peak positions of all spectra are aligned to zero applying an offset. We found that a time gate of 20 ns length
(i.e. ±10 ns with respect to zero) is adequate to separate prompt contributions and delayed ones (those with
|∆t | > 10 ns). As shown in Fig. 4 the neutron capture
peak disappears when we use the prompt gate. Unfortunately this gate impairs the reconstruction of the low
energy part of the spectra (compare the light grey and
the black spectra in Fig. 4). This is related to the relatively poor individual timing resolution of around 20 ns,
not properly optimized in the present measurements and
much worse than the 5 ns reported in [31] for the DTAS
prototype module. As a consequence, the effective energy threshold is increased, affecting the sum energy reconstruction. In fact, in the measurement of 95 Rb the
intense γ-ray of 204 keV energy is cut with this procedure (as can be seen in Fig. 12), and we estimate that the
effective threshold is about 280 keV instead of 90 keV.
As we will show later, this has an impact on the determination of the β intensity distribution. In the future,
a proper optimization of the individual timing resolution
and the use of narrower gates, could make this a better
method than the MC simulation method for the study of
isotopes with very large neutron emission probabilities or
unknown β-n decay properties.

TAGS ANALYSES

In the analysis we follow the method developed by the
Valencia group to determine the β-intensity distributions
in TAGS experiments [44–46]. For that, we have to solve
the following inverse problem [45]:

di =

X
j

Rij (B)fj + Ci

(1)

where di represents the number of counts in channel i of
the experimental spectrum, fj is the number of events
that feed level j in the daughter nucleus, Ci is the contribution of all contaminants to channel i, and Rij is
the response function of the spectrometer, that depends
on the branching ratios (B) between the states in the
daughter nucleus. The branching ratio matrix is calculated using the known decay information for the levels
at low excitation energy complemented with an estimate
based on the nuclear statistical model at high excitation
energy.
According to the Reference Input Parameter Library
(RIPL-3) [47], the level scheme of 137 Xe is complete up
to a level at 2726.140 keV, whereas for 95 Sr it is only considered complete up to a level at 1259.7 keV. These limits
define the known parts of the branching ratio matrices for
the two cases studied. For 137 Xe we considered, in addition, two alternative known parts of the level scheme:
up to the level at 2244.1 keV, where there is good agreement between the experimental number of levels and the
prediction of the statistical model (see Fig. 5), and up to
the level at 1534.32 keV, where there is a substantial gap
to the next level at 1621.1 keV.
In all cases, from the last known level included in the
known level scheme up to the Qβ value (maximum decay
energy window), a continuum region with 40 keV bins is
defined. The branching ratios in this continuum region
are determined with the statistical model, as presented in
[46]. All parameters used for the statistical model calculations are extracted from RIPL-3 [47] and summarized
in Table I, with PSF and deformation parameters based
on [48] and [49], respectively. The level density parameter “a” at the neutron binding energy used to calculate
the E1 γ-strength function is obtained from Enhanced
Generalized Superfluid Model (EGSM) calculations for
95
Sr [47], while for 137 Xe it is taken from B. Fogelberg
et al. [50]. The Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) plus
combinatorial nuclear level densities [51, 52] have been
used. For the level density of 95 Sr the C and P correction parameters from RIPL-3 were used (0.0 and 0.78795,
respectively). However, since the level density correction
factors for 137 Xe in RIPL-3 (C=2.96189 and P=1.09479)
did not reproduce the available experimental information, we have calculated new corrections (C=-1.02 and
P=0.69). In particular, the experimental number of resonances in 137 Xe in the region 4.03-4.53 MeV, just above
Sn , according to the experimental work of B. Fogelberg
et al. [53] is ≤4 1/2+ levels, (24 ± 8) 1/2− levels and
(16 ± 5) 3/2− levels. With the original correction factors from RIPL-3 one obtains unrealistically large values:
618 1/2+ levels, 12630 1/2− levels, and 24722 3/2− levels.
The new correction factors have been calculated to obtain a more reasonable number of levels in the resonance
region: 2.6 1/2+ levels, 12 1/2− levels, and 24 3/2− levels. In addition, both sets of correction factors reproduce
the accumulated number of levels at 1808.75 keV. A comparison of the original level density and the modified one
for 137 Xe is shown in Fig. 5. We should mention that

gated total absorption spectra as additional analysis criteria (where the module-multiplicity of an event, Mm ,
is defined as the number of modules that fire above the
threshold). All these tests improve significantly the reliability of the results, and they can provide a guide for
empirical modification of the branching ratio matrix.

The spin-parity value of the ground state (g.s.) of
I, according to ENSDF, is (7/2+ ), based on systematics [54]. In the analysis we used the value 7/2+ as
the primary choice and we considered decays by allowed
transitions and first forbidden transitions to states in the
known part of the level scheme, while only allowed transitions were considered to states in the continuum. Alternative g.s. spin-parity values of 7/2− and 5/2+ were
also used to construct alternative branching ratio matrices that also gave a reasonable reproduction of the total
absorption spectrum. The associated β-intensities were
considered in the evaluation of uncertainties. The three
different choices for the known part of the level scheme
in 137 Xe mentioned above were also investigated. They
were found to be equivalent, although the best reproduction of the total absorption spectrum was obtained with
the known level scheme extending up to 2726.140 keV.
Moreover, this choice was shown to reproduce better the
module-multiplicity gated spectra, as will be discussed
later. A comparison of the β-intensities obtained with
the three level schemes is shown in Fig. 6.

See text for details.

Once the branching-ratio matrix is constructed, the
response function Rij (B) is calculated by means of MC
simulations [44]. The detailed description of the geometry of the set-up and the nonproportionality of the light
yield in NaI(Tl), as described in [44], are included in
the simulations. The MC simulations were validated by
comparison with measurements of well-known radioactive sources [33]. The TAGS analysis is then carried out
by applying the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to extract the β-feeding distribution [45].
The branching ratio matrix constructed combining the
information from the statistical model and the known
level scheme, provides a realistic guess of the true branching ratio matrix. Differences in model branching ratio
matrices can appear not only because of the use of different nuclear statistical model parameters, but also because of ambiguities in the spin-parity values of levels
in the known part of the level scheme. The impact of
different choices of parameters can be used to estimate
systematic uncertainties in the resulting β-intensity distribution, as will be shown later. In fact, some choices
can be ruled out because they do not lead to a good
reproduction of the total absorption spectrum. In this
respect, a significant advance in the TAGS technique is
the introduction of segmented spectrometers like DTAS.
The model branching ratio matrix can now be subjected
to more restrictive tests, using the reproduction of the
individual-module spectra and the module-multiplicity

singles spectrum (no β-gated). In the bottom panel we
show the analysis of the β-gated spectrum with the 20 ns
coincidence gate that eliminates neutron-induced γ-rays.
The relative deviations between experimental and reconstructed spectra are shown in each case. They are small
up to 5.2 MeV, except for the 20 ns gated spectrum in
the first few hundred keV. This reflects the difficulty of
reproducing the effective module threshold in the MC
simulation. All three analyses were performed with the
reference branching ratio matrix. It should be noted that
the result of the analysis of the singles spectrum does not
depend on the simulated β-efficiency of the β-detector,
strongly varying close to Qβ , but is very sensitive to the
proper background subtraction. On the other hand, the
result of the analysis of the β-gated spectrum with the
neutron background suppressed does not depend on the
MC simulation of the β-n branch of the decay, but suffers
from the higher threshold at low energies. A comparison of the β-intensity distributions obtained from these
three analyses is presented in Fig. 8. As can be seen the
agreement is good except in the continuum region up to
3.5 MeV and for the weakly populated state at 601 keV.

We should mention that in the analysis of the singles
spectrum the contribution of the daughter decay (dasheddotted green line in the central panel of Fig. 7) was obtained from MC simulations. For that, the information
on this decay available in ENSDF [54] was used as input
for the DECAYGEN event generator [46]. This information is reliable according to our TAGS analysis of the
β-gated 137 Xe spectrum, and is in agreement with the
recent TAGS result of [55]. This procedure avoids the
impact of the large statistical fluctuations of the experimental 137 Xe singles spectrum after background subtraction. We would also like to point out that in the analysis
of the β-gated spectrum with the 20 ns time window, the
same time window was applied to obtain the spectrum
of the daughter decay contamination and the summingpileup contribution.

FIG. 8. Comparison of the β-intensities obtained for the decay
of 137 I from the TAGS analyses of three experimental spectra
with different β-gating conditions.

As mentioned before, the segmentation of DTAS allows one to make more stringent tests of the branching ratio matrix used to construct the spectrometer response function for the decay of interest. The quality
of the reproduction of the individual-module spectra and
the module-multiplicity gated total absorption spectra
was investigated for these purposes. The spectra of the
individual modules is sensitive to the single γ-ray energy distribution from the whole decay. A more powerful
test is provided by the total absorption spectra for different module-multiplicity conditions, which reflect the
γ-cascade energy and multiplicity distribution as a function of excitation energy. The corresponding experimental spectra were generated with a 500 ns β-gating time
window and are compared with MC simulations obtained
with the DECAYGEN event generator [46] using the reference branching-ratio matrix and the β-intensity distribution from the analysis of the total absorption spectra
(top panel in Fig. 7) as input. The comparison for the
sum of the 18 single-module spectra can be seen in Fig. 9.
A reasonable reproduction of the spectrum is obtained,
except for an excess of counts in the simulation in the
range 2.2 − 3.2 MeV and a deficit of counts in the interval 3.2 − 4.6 MeV. The quality of the reproduction of the
total absorption spectra for module-multiplicities from 1
to 6 is shown in Fig. 10. We should emphasize that the
same numerical factors used to normalize the contaminants for the total absorption spectrum (Fig. 7 top) were
used to normalize the contaminants for all multiplicities.
The agreement is excellent for Mm = 2 to Mm = 6. The
most significant differences are found for Mm = 1 and in
fact the behavior is similar to that observed for singlemodule spectra, not surprising since the Mm = 1 spectrum is mostly sensitive to single γ-ray de-excitations.
None of the changes in the branching ratio matrix that
we have tested (see discussion below) resulted in a better

agreement, thus we adopted this β-intensity distribution
as the reference solution. This distribution is obtained
for the 500 ns time window and it is depicted with red
points in the top panel of Fig 11. The black vertical
bars indicate the uncertainty obtained with the procedure detailed below. For comparison we include in this
figure the β-intensity obtained in high-resolution γ-ray
spectroscopy from ENSDF [54], as well as the β-intensity
followed by neutron emission, Iβn , discussed above. In
the lower panel of Fig 11 the accumulated β-intensity as
a function of excitation energy from DTAS is compared
with the one from ENSDF, showing clearly the effect of
Pandemonium in the high-resolution data and the importance of using the TAGS technique.

For the evaluation of the systematic uncertainty in the
β-intensity resulting from the TAGS analysis, we considered all possible solutions compatible with reproduction
of the data. In comparison, the statistical uncertainty
was found to be negligible. The envelope of all these βintensity distributions defines the uncertainty bars shown
in Fig. 11. The β-intensity distribution obtained in the
analysis of the β-gated spectrum with a 500 ns time window (shown in Fig. 7 top) is taken as the reference result,
and it can be found in the Supplemental Material [56].
The other two β-intensity distributions plotted in Fig. 8
obtained from the same data with different gating conditions are considered as cross-checks of the reference
solution. The influence of other experimental parameters in the results was investigated for the evaluation of
the uncertainties of the reference solution. One of these
parameters is the normalization factor of the contaminants. The corresponding normalization was varied until
the reproduction of the total absorption spectrum was

β-gated total absorption spectrum with the time window

ergy calibration parameters have been changed by 0.5%,
while the width calibration parameters were changed by
15%.
The influence of different branching ratio matrices was
considered as well. This includes the β-intensity distributions obtained with the alternative spin-parity values for
the g.s. level of 137 I mentioned above. We tested the impact on the electric dipole PSF of alternative values of the
level density parameter a at Sn : 7.118, from EGSM calculations, and 16.461, from TALYS [57] (see Table I). We
introduced by hand modifications in the branching ratio
matrix of the continuum in order to reproduce better the
experimental γ-intensities at low excitation energies obtained in high resolution studies [50, 53, 58] (see Table
II). Although it worsened the reproduction of the sum
of the individual modules and the module-multiplicity
gated spectra, it gave a good reproduction of the total
absorption spectrum and it was included in the evaluation of the uncertainties.
The impact of the first bin of the experimental spectrum included in the analysis was also evaluated. We
found that it affects significantly the g.s. feeding intensity determination and we considered variations of ±1
bin in the result. We have also used the maximum entropy (ME) algorithm [45] instead of the conventionally
used EM algorithm to check the influence of the method
of deconvolution in the analysis. The β intensities determined in all cases were normalized to 100-Pn , where we
take as a reference the value from ENSDF: 7.14% [54].
However, we also considered two alternative Pn values:
7.76% [60] and 7.33% [61].
We obtained a g.s. feeding intensity of 50.8(43)%. In
the analysis with a 20 ns window, an intensity of 47.4%
was obtained, while the analysis of the background subtracted singles spectrum gives a value of 49.9%. This
intensity was also calculated by means of a β-γ counting method for TAGS data proposed by Greenwood et
al. [62], and we obtained a similar value of 51.2(6)%.
These two values are larger than the quoted number in
ENSDF: 45.2(5)%. It is also worth mentioning that B.
Fogelberg et al. [53] reported a β-intensity of 47% to
the g.s., while a recent TAGS measurement determined
a value of 49(1)% [55].

in Fig. 13 (see also the Supplemental Material [56]). We
also performed the analysis of the β-gated spectrum with
a condition of 20 ns to eliminate the delayed contribution
associated with neutron interactions of the β-n branch
(see bottom panel of Fig. 12). Note that here there is a
prompt contribution due to the γ-rays de-exciting 94 Sr.
This did not happen in 137 I, where only the g.s. of 136 Xe
is populated. This contribution can be identified as an
837 keV γ-transition peak visible in the spectra. In the
β-gated spectrum with the wide time coincidence window, the prompt contribution is partially added to the
delayed contribution distorting the high energy side of
the neutron capture bump, as shown in Section II B. As
seen in the bottom panel of Fig. 12, the use of a 20 ns
time coincidence window in the MC simulation of the
β-n branch eliminates the neutron capture bump leaving a prominent peak at 837 keV used for normalization

of this contamination. It should be noted (compare top
and bottom panels in Fig. 12) that the increase of effective DTAS threshold associated with the narrow time
window, strongly affects the shape of the total absorption spectrum in this case. The reason is that we are
cutting some low-energy γ-rays that take part in many
cascades de-exciting high energy levels. In particular, the
intense γ-ray of 204 keV, which comes from a 7/2+ level
at 556 keV, is clearly cut, thus shifting and distorting the
spectrum. This explains the large differences in the βintensity distributions obtained from the analysis of both
spectra, as shown in Fig. 13.

Relevant histograms for the analysis of the
decay of 95 Rb: experimental β-gated spectrum (solid
grey), summing-pileup contribution (dashed blue), daughter spectrum (dashed-dotted green), granddaughter spectrum
(dashed-dotted-dotted pink) β-n branch (dotted orange) and
reconstructed spectrum (solid black). The analyses of two different experimental spectra are shown: β-gated with 500 ns
time gate (top) and β-gated with a gate of 20 ns to cut the βdelayed neutrons (bottom). See text for further details. The
relative deviations between experimental and reconstructed
spectra are shown for each case.

As in the case of 137 I the branching ratio matrix used in
these analyses was tested investigating the reproduction

of the sum of the individual-module spectra (see Fig. 14)
and the module-multiplicity gated spectra (see Fig. 15).
The result of the analysis of the β-gated spectrum with
the 500 ns time gate was used as the reference one. As
for 137 I, the overall agreement is excellent and the larger
differences are found for the Mm = 1 multiplicity gated
total absorption spectrum and the sum of the individualmodule spectra. The discrepancies in the reproduction of
the fine structure in these spectra above the last discrete
level in the known level scheme, seem to reflect the difficulty in the statistical model of reproducing variations
in the branching to the g.s for individual levels. The impact of these discrepancies in the β-intensity distribution
is small, given the limited contribution of Mm = 1 to the
total spectrum.
Similarly to the 137 I case, we have considered different sources of systematic error for the reference solution obtained with a 500 ns time window. The maximum variation of the normalization factor for the βdelayed neutron branch compatible with the reproduction of the total absorption spectrum was 10%. Due to
the large contribution of the β-delayed neutron branch,
especially at high energies, the summing-pileup normalization could be changed by a factor 100%, and the activities of daughter and granddaughter were changed by
a factor 50% without noticing a distortion in the reproduction of the spectrum. Apart from that, we have considered the same possible sources of uncertainty as in 137 I
for the threshold of the β-detector, the energy calibration
and the width calibration. We also considered the solution obtained by applying the ME deconvolution method.
Apart from the ENSDF Pn value of 8.7% [59], alternative
values have been used to normalize the β-intensities to
100-Pn : 8.87% [61] and 9.08% [60]. A modified branching ratio matrix reproducing the known γ-intensities for

ies [63], was also considered (see Table II). Although it
gave acceptable results, it worsened the reproduction of
the total spectrum and the reproduction of the modulemultiplicity gated spectra. The β intensity distribution
obtained with a narrow gate of 20 ns is considered just
as a cross-check (see Fig. 13) and it was not included in
the error budget.
In Fig. 16, the β-intensity distribution including
the systematic uncertainty is compared with the highresolution result from ENSDF [59]. The β-intensity distribution obtained with DTAS is normalized to 100-Pn ,
whereas the intensity in ENSDF is normalized to 77.941%
[59] since the evaluators recognized the incompleteness of
the experimental information.

γ-NEUTRON COMPETITION

In the two β-delayed neutron emitters studied in this
work a significant amount of β intensity de-exciting by
means of γ-rays, Iβγ , is observed above Sn . In order to
compare with the neutron emission probability (Pn ) we
can define Pγ as the integrated Iβγ above Sn :
Z

Qβ

Pγ =

Iβγ dEx

(2)

Sn

In Table III the Pγ values obtained in this work are
compared with the Pn values. The β-intensity connecting to levels that de-excite by means of γ-rays represents
56% of the total β-intensity above Sn for 137 I and 25%

for 95 Rb. The situation is similar to that found in the decays of 87,88 Br [7, 8] and can be understood as a nuclear
structure effect, as discussed below. Compared to the
γ intensity observed above Sn in high-resolution experiments, retrieved from the ENSDF data base, we observe
3 and 5 times higher values for 137 I and 95 Rb, respectively, indicating a sizable Pandemonium effect.
The uncertainties quoted in Table III are the quadratic
sum of two terms. One term is evaluated from the dispersion of Pγ values calculated from the different β intensity
distributions obtained in our analysis under different assumptions, as explained in previous Sections. The second
term arises from the uncertainty in the first bin considered in the integration of Eq. (2), due to the uncertainty
of our energy calibration. This term amounts to 20% for
137
I, and 26% for 95 Rb and dominates the upper limit of
the uncertainty given in Table III.
Similar to the previous works on 87,88 Br and 94 Rb [7,
8], we have evaluated the ratio Iβγ /(Iβγ + Iβn ) as a function of the excitation energy above Sn . This ratio is
equivalent to the average ratio of widths: hΓγ /(Γγ +Γn )i,
that is calculated in the Hauser-Feshbach formalism as
described in detail in [8, 9]. The ingredients for these
calculations are the NLD and the PSF in the daughter
nucleus, and the NTC into the β-delayed neutron descendant. The first two are the same used for the construction of the branching ratio matrix in the TAGS analysis,
whereas NTC are obtained from optical model calculations performed with TALYS-1.8 [57]. In the case of 137 I
we only need to consider the neutron transmission to the
0+ g.s. of 136 Xe, while in the case of 95 Rb several levels
are populated in 94 Sr. Spin-parity values from RIPL-3
[47] have been selected for those levels in 94 Sr that have
no experimentally assigned values.
For the calculation of the average ratio of widths we
used the MC method explained in [8]. This allows one
to take into account Porter-Thomas fluctuations on neutron and γ widths. A direct comparison between the
experimental ratio of β-intensities and the average ratio of widths is meaningful, since the average is taken
over all levels of a given J π in the daughter nucleus
within the experimental energy bin of 40 keV. The allowed decay of 137 I populates positive parity states with
J=5/2, 7/2, 9/2, while in the decay of 95 Rb negative
parity states with J=3/2, 5/2, 7/2 are populated. In
Fig. 17 the comparison between the experimental ratio
and the calculation for each J π is shown. The uncertainty band around the experimental result (grey filled
area) corresponds to the envelope of the ratios calculated
for all possible β intensity distributions compatible with
the data, discussed in the previous Section. As seen in
the figure, the large Pγ in 137 I is coming from 7/2+ and
9/2+ states that need to emit l ≥ 4 neutrons to populate the 0+ g.s. in 136 Xe. This emission is hindered
by the centrifugal barrier. Analogously, in the decay of
95
Rb, the emission of l = 3 neutrons from 5/2− and 7/2−
states to populate the g.s. in 94 Sr is very suppressed up
to Ex − Sn = 837 keV, the energy of the first excited

The β-intensity distributions obtained in this work
were also used to calculate the β energy spectra by means
of subroutines from the log f t program of NNDC [64]. In
the calculations we have assumed allowed shapes for all
decay branches.
In Fig. 18 the deduced β spectra for the decays of 137 I
and 95 Rb are presented. The distributions calculated
with the data from ENSDF, based on high-resolution
γ-ray spectroscopy measurements [54, 59], are also included for comparison. They show a shift to higher energies with respect to the TAGS data, characteristic of the
Pandemonium systematic error. The β spectra include
the contribution of the β-delayed neutron branch. For
both nuclei the β spectra were measured by Tengblad

This method is also Pandemonium free and a meaningful
comparison between our calculated β spectra and their
experimental data can be made, in line with [8, 35]. Differences in shape are observed for both isotopes, as shown
in Fig. 18. This is especially clear in the case of 95 Rb.
For both nuclei we observe agreement at high energies,
while our spectra is lower at intermediate energies and
higher at lower energies. The jump observed in Tengblad et al. data below 0.8 MeV is due to the use of a
different detector.
The average γ and β energies obtained with the present
TAGS results are listed in Table IV, where uncertainties
correspond to the evaluation of the mean energies for all
the solutions compatible with a good analysis result mentioned in Section III. For the mean β energies we have
summed the contribution from the beta-delayed neutron
branch, taken from ENSDF [54, 59]. In the mean γenergy calculation of 95 Rb the contribution of the γ emis-

evident for the comparison of the accumulated β intensities), the average energies for 137 I listed in Table IV do
not differ significantly. This is due to the redistribution
of the β-intensity consequence of the larger g.s. feeding probability that we determined. This is not the case
for 95 Rb, where the average γ energy of the databases is
clearly underestimated, whereas the average β energy is
overestimated, as is normally found with the Pandemonium effect [28].

sion in the de-excitation of 94 Sr has also been taken into
account. The average γ energies measured at OSIRIS
by Rudstam et al. [66], and the β energies obtained
by Tengblad et al. [65] are also listed for comparison,
taken from [66]. A similar comparison has been done in
two recent publications [8, 35] for a number of nuclei. A
problem with the normalization of the average decay γ
energies was pinpointed in [35]: all average γ energies in
[66] should be scaled up by 14%. In our case, however,
even though Rudstam mean γ energies are larger than
the TAGS values, both sets of numbers are compatible
within the quoted errors. It is not the case for the mean
β energies, where discrepancies beyond the quoted errors
are found, following the trend shown in [8] and in line
with the shape discrepancies of Fig. 18.
In Table IV we also include for comparison the β and γ
average energies from the ENDF/B-VII.1 [67] and JEFF3.1 [68] databases. Although a clear Pandemonium effect was observed when comparing the present TAGS β-

REACTOR SUMMATION CALCULATIONS

The impact of the present results on reactor antineutrino summation calculations has been evaluated. For
this, the summation method developed by the group of
Nantes [27] has been employed assuming allowed shapes.
The impact of the present results in the calculation for
each of the four main fissile isotopes in a pressurized
water reactor (PWR) - 235 U, 239 Pu, 241 Pu, and 238 U has been evaluated. For 239 Pu the ratio between the antineutrino spectrum calculated with the inclusion of the
present TAGS β-intensity distributions, and the original
calculation, where Rudstam data were taken, is shown in
Fig. 19. Similar figures are obtained for the other three
fissile isotopes. The effect of the results for 137 I is to increase the ratio by up to 1% in the region 4-6 MeV for
uranium and plutonium isotopes. On the other hand, the
new results for 95 Rb increase the ratio up to 0.5% in the
region of 7-8.5 MeV in the four fissile isotopes.

A summation method was also employed for the calculation of the reactor DH. The impact of replacing the
average γ and β energies available at ENDF/B-VII.1 by

the present TAGS values has been studied. The effect
in the electromagnetic component of 235 U and 239 Pu is
an increase of < 1% and < 0.5%, respectively, for times
shorter than 1 s. The light particle component is reduced
by less than 0.5% in both cases below 1 s. Such a modest
impact can be understood on the one hand due to the
similarity between the TAGS average energies and the
values available at ENDF/B-VII.1 for 137 I, and on the
other hand because of the low cumulative fission yield of
95
Rb.

CONCLUSIONS

In this work we reported the results of the TAGS measurements of two important β-delayed neutron emitters.
The sensitivity of our technique made it possible to determine the β-intensity to states above Sn followed by γrays. This β-intensity was found to be larger than in previous measurements affected by the Pandemonium effect.
Moreover, it represents 56% and 25% of the β-intensity
above Sn in 137 I and 95 Rb, respectively. The competition between neutron emission and γ de-excitation can
be understood as an effect of nuclear structure, due to
the large neutron angular momentum required to populate the granddaughter levels, because of their spin-parity
values.
The presence of the Pandemonium effect in previous
high-resolution data was deduced when comparing the
present TAGS β-intensity distributions and the values
from ENSDF, as well as the average γ and β energies
with the reference values from the databases. The β
spectra constructed with the β-intensity distributions of
this work were compared with the measured spectra free
from Pandemonium from Tengblad et al.. Discrepancies
in the shape of the spectra were found, in line with recent
works [8, 35].
A careful study of the systematic uncertainties was performed for each case in order to verify our results. We
also considered the results obtained from the analyses
of spectra constructed with a γ-neutron discrimination
condition. Even though the set-up was not optimized for
such a procedure, the reasonable quality of the results reinforces the interest of this methodology for future TAGS
measurements of β-delayed neutron emitters. In addition, for 137 I, the analysis of the background subtracted

singles spectrum was found to be in good agreement with
the analysis of the β-gated spectra.
Two stringent cross-checks of the branching ratio matrices for 137 I and 95 Rb were carried out by means of MC
simulations based on our results: reproduction of the individual crystal spectra and reproduction of the modulemultiplicity gated spectra. Both were reasonably well
reproduced with the results of our TAGS analysis, showing two important features of our analysis procedure: the
quality of the MC simulations (including the reproduction of the β-n branch) and the validity of our branching
ratio matrices. For low-lying levels, we have also reproduced the known absolute γ-intensities obtained with our
β-intensity distributions after modifying the branching
ratio matrix. Although it did not lead to the best reproduction of the spectra, which was interpreted as a consequence of the incomplete knowledge of these decays, it
was included in the estimation of systematic uncertainties.
Finally, the impact of these new results in reactor summation calculations has been evaluated. The effect of
replacing previous database values with our new results
was found to be less than 1% for both antineutrino spectrum calculations and DH calculations.
