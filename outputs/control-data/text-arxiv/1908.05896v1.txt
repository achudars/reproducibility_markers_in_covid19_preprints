Abstract

In this article, we stochastically compare the series and parallel systems hav—
ing Topp—Leone generated family of distributions. We consider that the lifetimes
of the components of the systems have either the different shape parameters
When the scale parameters are ﬁxed or the different scale parameters When the
shape parameters are ﬁxed and established some ordering results With the help
of vector majorization technique.

Keywords: Topp—Leone generated family of distributions; majorization; order statistics;
usual stochastic order; hazard rate order; likelihood ratio order.

Introduction

Order statistics play a prominent role in statistics, applied probability, actuarial sci—
ence, reliability theory and many other related ﬁelds. Let XML 3 Xgm S

3 XML

represent the order statistics arising from the random variables X1, X2, . . . ,Xn. Also,
let Xkm represents the kth order statistic Which is related to the lifetimes of (n — k + 1)—

out—Of—n system. In particular, XML (When k = n) and XML (When k = 1) denote

the lifetimes of parallel and series systems, respectively. It has been studied exten—
sively in the literature and found to be fruitful in comparisons of lifetimes of series
and parallel systems Where the components’ lifetimes are independent and identically

distributed (i.i.d.). But in the case When the lifetimes of the components are non—i.i.d.,

the distribution theory becomes quite complicated. Because of this reason, hardly few

results are available in the literature (see, for example, Balakrishnan and Rao (1998)
and David and Nagaraja (2003), and references Cited therein).

Many researchers have worked upon the stochastic comparisons between the life—
times of different systems Where the random lifetimes of components follow various life—

time distributions, for example, Dykstra et a1. (1997) and Khaledi and Kochar (2000)

studied the comparisons of parallel systems of heterogeneous exponential components.

Khaledi and Kochar (2006), Fang and Tang (2014), and Torrado and Kochar (2015)

considered the case of heterogeneous Weibull distributions. Moreover, several results
have been derived for the heterogeneous generalized exponential distributions, gamma
and Pareto type distributions (see, for examples, Balakrishnan and Zhao (2013), Bal—

akrishnan et al. (2014), and Patra et al. (2018)). For recent references on the results

related to the stochastic comparisons of this type, we refer to Barmalzan et al. (2016),
Fang et al. (2016), Fang and Wang (2017), and Nadarajah et al. (2017). Apart from
these types of comparisons, the families of distributions have also been considered.
Some well known families of lifetime distributions are exponentiated Weibull (Mud—

holkar and Srivastava (1993)) and generalized exponential (Gupta and Kundu (1999)),

etc. Recently, Kayal (2018) studied the stochastic comparisons of series and parallel
systems with Kumaraswaniy generalized family of distributions.
It is important to mention that the notion of majorization is one of the useful
tool to compare lifetimes of series and parallel systems. The concept of majorization
deals with the diversity of components of vectors in R". Let w = (151,152, . . . ,xn) and
y = (y1,y2,...,yn) be two real vectors. Further, let 23(1) 3 23(2) 3
S 2:00 and
9(1) 3 ya) 3
3 gm) denote the increasing order of the components of w and y,
m

respectively. The vector w is said to be majorized by vector y (written as as j y) if
.

.

m

2221 $09) 2 2221 gas), 2' = 1,. .. ,n—1, and 2221 $0,) = 2221 3/09). Thus, w j y tells

that the components of w are less dispersed as compared to those of the y. Majorization
has played an important role to study several stochastic orders in various ﬁelds such
as reliability theory, economics, mathematics, statistics and so on. For more details of
majorization and its applications, one may refer to Marshall et al. (2011).
In this paper, we consider the stochastic comparisons of series and parallel systems
with respect to the likelihood ratio order, the hazard rate order, and the usual stochastic
order using vector majorization technique, where the components of the systems follow
Topp—Leone generated family of distributions. This distribution was recently given by
Rezaei et al. (2017) as a generalization of Topp and Leone’s distribution (see, Topp and
Leone (1955)). It has the property to model bathtub shaped hazard rates depending
upon the values of parameters and it can be used for lifetime modelling. For more
applications of this distribution, one may refer to Rezaei et al. (2017). Let X be a
random variable following the Topp—Leone generated (TL—G) family of distribution.
The probability density function (p.d.f.) and the cumulative distribution function

(c.d.f.) of X are given by

f(x; 059,6) = 2a99(x;€)G(x;€)0a‘1(1 - G($;€)0)(2 - G($;€)e)a‘17 :6 Z 0, 9,0z > 0
and

(1.1)

F(x; aﬂé) = (G(x;€)0(2 - G($;€)0))a, :6 Z 0, 9,0z > 0,

(1-2)

respectively, where 6 is the scale parameter, 01 is the shape parameter, C(36) is a
baseline C.d.f., g(x; E) is the corresponding p.d.f., and 6 contains the parameters which
specify the baseline distribution. For convenience, we use the notion X ~TL—G(a, 6, E).

Note that, Topp—Leone’s distribution is a particular case of TL—G family of distribution,

when G(x; E) be the U(0, 1) and 6 = 1. Various cases of TL—G(a, 6, E) can be obtained
by using G(x; E) as a parent distribution function such as exponential, normal, log—
logistic, and gamma, and we get TL—exponential, TL—normal, TL—log—logistic, and TL—
ganinia distributions, respectively.

The outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we brieﬂy present some
deﬁnitions of stochastic orders and majorization, and discuss some lemmas which are
useful to derive our results. In Section 3, we provide some ordering results with respect
to the usual stochastic and the likelihood ratio orderings for the comparisons of parallel
systems and with respect to the usual stochastic and the hazard rate orderings for the
comparisons of series systems with TL—G distributed components.
Throughout the paper, we use the notion R 2 (—oo, oo), R+ = [0, 00), and R" 2
(—oo, 00)". The terms increasing and decreasing are used for non—decreasing and non—
increasing, respectively.

Preliminaries

In this section, we ﬁrst recall some deﬁnitions of stochastic orders and vector majoriza—
tion. Then, we discuss some useful lemmas which are essential to develop the results
conferred in the next section.

2.1

Stochastic Orders

Let X and Y be two random variables having the common support R+ with the dis—
tribution functions FX() and Fy(-), the probability density functions fX(-) and fy(-),

and the hazard rate functions 7'X(-) and 7'y(-), respectively. Let FX(-) 2 1 — FX(-) and
Fy(-) = 1 — Fy(-) be the survival functions of X and Y, respectively.
Deﬁnition 2.1. X is said t0 be smaller than Y m the

(2') usual stOChastz'c Order (written as X ﬁst Y) if Fy(;1:) 3 FX (:13), Vx E R4“;

(ii) hazard rate Order (written as X Sm Y) if Fy(x)/FX(:1:) is increasing in :1: E R+,
or equivalently if TX (:13) Z 7'y(x), Vx E R4“;

(iii) likelihOOd ratio Order (written as X S” Y) if fy(:l:)/fX(:E) is increasing in :1: E
R+.

The following implications are well—known.

(2007).

2.2

Majorization

In this subsection, we brieﬂy present some deﬁnitions and results related to the vector
majorization which are very useful in dealing with various inequalities while comparing
the order statistics. Let w = (151,152, . . . ,xn) and y = (3/1, 3/2, . . . ,yn) be two real vectors
from R". Further, let {13(1) S {13(2) S - - - S mm) and 3/0) S 3/9) S - - - S 3/00 denote the

increasing order of the components of w and y, respectively.
Deﬁnition 2.2. w is said t0 be

(2') majorized by y (written as w j y) if
21309) 2 :90?” 2': 1,...,n— 1, and 21309) 2 Eggs).

From the Deﬁnition 2.2, it is easy to verify that w j y implies w jw y. For a
comprehensive study on majorization, we refer the reader to Marshall et al. (2011) .

Consequently, m g y on I" implies ¢(m) S ¢(y).

Main Results and Conclusions

In this section, we compare the lifetimes of series and parallel systems having indepen—
dent TL—G distributed components. These results are presented with heterogeneity in
one parameter while another is ﬁxed.
The following theorem deals with the hazard rate ordering of series systems when
the parameter a = (a1, a2, . . . ,Ozn) varies.
Theorem 3.1. Let X1,X2, . . . ,Xn and Y1,Y2, . . . ,Yn be the tw0 sets of independent

random variables with Xk N TL-G(Ozk, 6, E) and Yk N TL-G(Oz;:, 6, E) for h = 1,2,. .. ,n,
respectively. Then, for ﬁxed 6 > 0 and for any ﬁxed 6, we have

On taking t = G(x; §)6(2 — G(x; §)6) and using Lemma 2.3, it follows that 2(a) is

convex in 01. Now, on using Lemma 2.4, we conclude that 2221 Z(Ozk) is Schur—convex

on (0, 00)", which implies that if (1* § (1, then TX1m(IE) Z ry1:n(:t). Hence the theorem
follows.

E

Now, we present the following example to discuss the above theorem.
Example 3.1. Consider that G(x;§) = 1 — 6—9”, :1: Z 0. Let X1,X2 and Y1,Y2 be
the two sets of independent random variables with Xk N TL-G(Ozk,6,€) and Y2 N
TL—G(a;,6,§) for h = 1,2, respectively. Assume a1 = 1,a2 = 9, 04: = 4,04: = 6,
and 6 = 0.5. Clearly, (07:,073) § (041,042), and therefore, using Theorem 3.1, we have
X122 3hr Y122. This can also be concluded from the Figure 1(a) where we plot TX1:2(IE) —
B
ry1:2(:t) which is non—negative for :1: Z 0.
One may be interested to know whether Theorem 3.1 can be extended to the
likelihood ratio order. The following counterexample shows that the result will not
hold.
Counterexample 3.1. Continuing with the Example 3.1, if we plot fymm we get the
fX1:2 (m) 7

Figure 1(b), which shows that as the value of :1: increases, the ratio ﬁrst increases and

then decreases. Hence the result in Theorem 3.1 cannot be extended to the likelihood
ratio order.

In the next theorems, we provide the stochastic comparisons of parallel systems

On using Lemma 2.1, 90(6) is Schur—concaye in 6. Thus, —90(6) is increasing in 6k

The following example illustrates the result established in Theorem 3.2.

Example 3.2. Consider that G(x;§) = 1 — 6—9”, x Z 0. Let X1,X2 and Y1,Y2 be

the two sets of independent random variables with Xk N TL-G(Ot,6k,€) and Y2 N
TL—G(Oi,6;:,§) for h = 1,2, respectively. Assume 61 = 0.1, 62 = 0.4, 6* = 0.2, 63 =
0.5, and Oz 2 0.5. Clearly, (61,62) jw (6*,63), and therefore, using Theorem 3.2,
we have X2.2 Sgt 122.

This can also be seen from the Figure 2(a) where we plot

FX2:2(x) — Fy2:2(fL’) which is non—negative for x Z 0.

The following counterexample shows that the result in Theorem 3.2 may not hold
for the likelihood ratio order.

Counterexample 3.2. Continuing with the Example 3.2, if we plot

fX2:2 (m)

, we get the

Figure 2(b), which shows that as the value of :1: increases, the ratio ﬁrst increases and

then decreases. Thus, the result in Theorem 3.2 cannot be extended to the likelihood
ratio order.

Till now we have derived the results when TL—G family of distributions have the

Theorem 3.6. Let W1, W2, . . . ,Wn and W1*, W2*, . . . , W; be the two sets of independent
random variables with Wk N TL—G(a, 62, G1) and W; N TL—G(a, 6;, G2) for h =
1, 2, . . . ,n, respectively. For ﬁxed 09 > 0, if

(i) 6 jw 6*, then Xf 3399 X; implies I/V9m Sgt W915”;
(ii) (61,62, . . . ,6”) S (61*,63, . . . ,6;*,), i.e., if 6k 3 6;,[41 =1,2,...,n, then Xf 339 X;
implies WW, 3399 Win.

Proof. Let Zf, Z3, . . . , Z; be the set of independent random variable with Z2 N TL —
G(a, 6;, G1) for h = 1, 2, . . . ,n. On using the arguments similar to that used in the

proof of Theorem 3.5, the part (i) and part (ii) follows from the Theorem 3.2 and
Theorem 3.3, respectively.
