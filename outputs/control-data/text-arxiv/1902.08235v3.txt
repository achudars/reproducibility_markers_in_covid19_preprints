Abstract: We consider a minimal left-right model with a Peccei-Quinn symmetry, where
generalised charge conjugation plays the role of the left-right symmetry. We show how
the spontaneous breaking of the Peccei-Quinn symmetry by a scalar singlet can provide
us with solutions not only to the strong CP and dark matter problems but can also help
to generate naturally suppressed off-diagonal CKM elements and small neutrino masses
via the inverse seesaw mechanism. For this, we make use of an economical scalar sector
composed of a bi-doublet, two doublets and a singlet only. As a result of the new gauge
bosons and neutrinos, the neutrinoless double beta decay, as well as lepton flavour violating
processes, receives new contributions which can, in principle, become relevant due to the
low-scale nature of the inverse seesaw mechanism. The model can easily accommodate
all the current data on fermion masses and mixing even if the left-right scale is only high
enough to evade the current experimental constraints.

Introduction

A common way to tackle some of the open questions in the Standard Model (SM) is to
extend its gauge structure. One of the simplest SM extensions, based on the gauge group
SU (3)c ⊗ SU (2)L ⊗ SU (2)R ⊗ U (1)B−L ,

(1.1)

is the left-right (LR) symmetric model. In its minimal versions, LR models also feature
a discrete symmetry, either the generalised parity P or charge conjugation C, connecting
both the SU (2) groups. Even though P is more commonly used as the LR symmetry
and, in fact, it was originally chosen as such [1–4], the case for adopting C instead has the
advantage of being compatible with the SO(10) grand unified theory. As a result of the
imposition of such symmetries, three generations of right-handed neutrinos are necessarily
introduced allowing, in principle, for the implementation of the (type-I) seesaw mechanism
for neutrino mass generation [5–8].

–1–

In general, generating neutrino masses via the type-I seesaw mechanism requires a very
high energy scale (vR ∼ ΛGU T ) from which the right-handed neutrinos get their masses. In
the case of the LR model, the very same vR scale breaks the original symmetry down to the
SM group, and searches for new gauge bosons can be used to put a lower bound on vR of
only a few TeV [9, 10]. While the type-I seesaw mechanism can be accommodated at such
a “low” scale, the price to be paid is the introduction of unreasonably suppressed Yukawa
couplings. Thus, other variants of the seesaw mechanism that can take place at the TeV
scale without requiring unnaturally suppressed Yukawas, such as the inverse seesaw [11],
become very attractive in this context. The implementation of the inverse seesaw in some
of the different versions of the LR model has been explored e.g. in refs. [12–18].
When it comes to the quark sector, the minimal LR model provides quarks with masses
due to their coupling to a scalar bi-doublet (and its charge conjugated) that acquires a
nontrivial vacuum expectation value (vev). However, similar to the SM, the mass hierarchy
among the different generations and the approximately diagonal structure of the quark
mixing, CKM, matrix are left unexplained. In a recent work [19], the authors propose
an elegant solution within the LR framework to the latter problem to what they refer
as the “flavour alignment” puzzle. In their model, quark mixing is small as a result of
being generated at one-loop in a LR model with a Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry [20–22].
This happens when, in addition to the new global symmetry, new degrees of freedom are
introduced in the scalar sector of the most popular LR model. With the spontaneous
breaking of the PQ symmetry at a very high scale, the strong CP problem is solved and
an invisible axion arises and plays the role of a dark matter candidate. Nevertheless, in
order to reproduce the current neutrino data, they argue that the LR symmetry has to
be broken at 50 TeV, which is above the most stringent constraints as well as outside the
reach of current experiments. An alternative solution to the flavour alignment puzzle and
the strong CP problem was later proposed in ref. [23], where the PQ symmetry is broken
softly in such a way that both the off-diagonal CKM elements and the strong CP phase
are naturally suppressed for they are radiatively generated. In both ref. [19] and ref. [23],
P is the LR symmetry.
In this paper, we face the above-mentioned problems by proposing a minimal LR model
with a PQ symmetry, where C plays the role of the LR symmetry. In such a framework, we
show that, when the global PQ symmetry is broken at a very high scale by a scalar singlet,
the model provides solutions not only to the strong CP and dark matter problems but can
also help to generate naturally suppressed off-diagonal elements for the quark mixing matrix
and small neutrino masses via the inverse seesaw mechanism. The adopted scalar sector
is compact. In addition to the PQ symmetry breaking scalar singlet σ, a SU (2)R doublet,
ηR , is required to break the LR symmetry down to the SM group. A SU (2)L doublet, ηL ,
is also introduced to preserve the LR symmetry. Finally, to perform the last step of the
symmetry breaking process, a scalar bi-doublet, Φ, gets a vev at the electroweak scale. As
√
the SU (2)R symmetry is broken by vR / 2, the vev of ηR , the non-SM gauge bosons get
masses at this scale, while the remaining vector bosons are identified with the SM ones.
The usual LR fermion sector with SU (2)L(R) doublets which contains the SM fermions
and three right-handed neutrinos is enlarged by three neutral fermion singlets required to

–2–

implement the inverse seesaw. When only renormalisable Yukawa terms are assumed, the
quark mixing matrix becomes trivial and some of the neutrinos remain massless. Upon the
introduction of non-renormalisable operators involving the scalar σ, the small off-diagonal
elements of the CKM matrix and neutrino masses are naturally obtained. Because of the
new gauge bosons and the new neutrinos, all of which get masses proportional to vR , the
neutrinoless double beta decay (0ν2β) receives several non-standard contributions which
can, in principle, become sizeable when vR is around the TeV scale due to the low-scale
nature of the inverse seesaw. Similarly, lepton flavour violating processes, such as the
µ → eγ decay, can receive large contributions in this framework. The model can easily
accommodate all the current data on fermion masses and mixing even if the LR scale is
only high enough to evade the current experimental constraints.
This work is written following the structure below. In Sec. 2, we present our model,
introducing all the relevant fields and showing how they transform under the symmetries
considered. The scalar potential is then shown in Sec. 3, followed by the derivation of the
respective particle spectrum. Sec. 4 deals with the gauge sector and its spectrum. In Sec. 5,
fermion masses and mixing are studied in detail. For the quarks, we show how the structure
of the CKM matrix is naturally generated in our model. While for the leptons, we show
how the active neutrinos get sub-eV masses via the inverse seesaw mechanism. Section 6 is
devoted to the study of the most relevant contributions to 0ν2β. In section 7, we investigate
how lepton flavour violating processes and heavy neutrino interactions can constraint our
model. Finally, our conclusions are summarised in Sec. 8, and particular solutions for the
quark and lepton sectors are displayed in the Appendices B and C, respectively.

Symmetries and the field content

The continuous symmetry group of our LR model can be written as
SU (3)c ⊗ SU (2)L ⊗ SU (2)R ⊗ U (1)B−L (⊗ U (1)P Q ) ,

(2.1)

where U (1)P Q , the global Peccei-Quinn symmetry, is in parentheses to emphasise that it
is not a gauged symmetry as the others. Additionally, as already mentioned, the model
is invariant under a discrete C symmetry. In what follows, we present all the fields in our
model and define how they transform under these symmetries.
The left-handed fermions transform as SU (2)L doublets, in the same way as in the
SM. Contrary to the SM though, the right-handed fermions do not come as singlets of the
weak gauge group but as SU (2)R copies of the SU (2)L doublets, that is

neutrinos, ναL and ναR , are present and neutrino masses are generated via the inverse
seesaw mechanism, three is also the minimum number of fermion singlets SαR required to
reproduce the current neutrino data. At last, under the discrete C symmetry, the fermions
transform according to2

The Higgs mechanism takes place when the neutral components of such fields acquire nontrivial vevs, breaking spontaneously the initial symmetry in eq. (2.1) down to SU (3)c ⊗

U (1)Q in three steps. In the first step hσi = vσ / 2 breaks the PQ symmetry. The second
stage, i.e.

is performed by the vevs of Φ: hφ01 i = v1 / 2 and hφ02 i = v2 / 2. We assume the following
hierarchy among the different energy scales vσ  vR  v1  v2 .
In summary, in Table 1 we show the U (1) charges of the fermion and scalar fields,
from which we can see that U (1)B−L is a gauged combination of U (1)B and U (1)L . It
is also worth mentioning that, along the lines of refs. [25] and [26], discrete symmetries
can be used to protected our axion solution from potentially dangerous U (1)P Q violating
gravitational corrections.

(3.5)

Similarly, it allows us to rewrite the parameters µ2σ , µ2 and µ2Φ in terms of the vevs and
the dimensionless couplings. From eq. (3.5), assuming the dimensionless couplings to be
of order one, and the vevs: v2 = O(1) GeV, v1 = O(102 ) GeV, vR = O(104 ) GeV and
vσ = O(1011 ) GeV, we expected that f = O(10−4 ) GeV. The scale of the vev vσ is taken
here to have a value within the interval where the axion – the pseudo Nambu-Goldstone
boson of the PQ symmetry breakdown – can be a cold dark matter candidate [27] (see
below).
At this point it is worth stressing that without the PQ symmetry, the scalar potential
would contain terms such as ηL† ΦηR , resulting in an effective vev for ηL . As we shall
see in the next sections, vL = 0 (or at least vL negligible when compared to the other
vevs) is paramount for the inverse seesaw mechanism to take place. Therefore, the PQ
symmetry is intrinsically associated with the neutrino mass generation mechanism in our
model. Previous studies involving the inverse seesaw in LR models, such as in refs. [12, 18],
have dealt with this issue differently. While in ref. [12], the authors avoid such an issue
by assuming an asymmetric LR model in which ηL is absent, in ref. [18] the authors argue
that by keeping the dimensionful parameter f small (f . 100 keV for vR ' 100 TeV), the
effective vev hηL0 i will be small enough to make sure that the inverse seesaw is realised.
With this particular solution that minimises the potential, we can finally derive the
scalar particle spectrum. The scalar sector initially contains eighteen degrees of freedom.

–6–

After symmetry breaking, six of those are expected to be absorbed by the gauge sector and
make the vector bosons massive. Therefore, we are left with twelve physical scalar degrees
of freedom. For simplicity, we present here only the mass states and eigenvalues, while all
the squared mass matrices are shown in the Appendix A.

case, is NDM = 3. For example, taking vσ = 1011−10 GeV we can have ma ' (0.17 − 1.7)
meV. Studies on the DFSZ (NDM = 6) and KSVZ (NDM = 1) models have pointed out
that axions with masses around the meV and sub-meV scales, respectively, could be the
dominant component of dark matter [28] (see also [27]). Although our model might be
viewed as a hybrid DFSZ-KSVZ axion model since both the SM and the new heavy quarks
carry U (1)P Q charges, we expect that the axion here with mass in the meV or sub-meV
scale could act as the dominant dark matter component in the Universe. A detailed study
devoted to determine the preferred mass range in which the axion in our model can play
the role of the dominant dark matter component would certainly be interesting, but out of
the scope of the present work.
Finally, we take a look at the CP-even fields Sσ , S1 , S2 and SR . These four real fields
mix among themselves according to a 4 × 4 symmetric mass matrix. Making use of the
fact that vσ is much larger than any other vev in the model, we consider the limit where
Sσ decouples from the other real fields. In such a limit, Sσ gets the following mass
m2Sσ ' 2λσ vσ2 .

(3.13)

Thus, the original 4 × 4 becomes a 3 × 3 matrix. To make its diagonalisation process
simpler, we take the smallest vev, v2 , to be zero. Upon this simplification, we find the
following eigenmasses

which are associated with the physical fields whose main contribution come from the fields

identified with the SM Higgs field, with mass mS1 ' 125 GeV, whereas the other two are
heavier Higgses.

The gauge boson mass spectrum

The gauge bosons become massive via the Higgs mechanism once the scalar fields acquire
non-vanishing vevs. Their masses can be obtained from the following terms
L = (Dµ ηL )† (Dµ ηL ) + (Dµ ηR )† (Dµ ηR ) + (Dµ Φ)† (Dµ Φ) + (Dµ σ)∗ (Dµ σ) .

(4.1)

Because σ is a gauge singlet, Dµ σ → ∂µ σ, it does not contribute to the gauge field masses.

with the SM charged vector boson. Furthermore, taking, for instance, vR = 15 TeV,
v1 ∼ vEW = 246 GeV and v2 ∼ 1 GeV, we have that mWR ' 4.9 TeV, and the mixing
angle is very small: |ζ| ' 2.2 × 10−6 . For these values, mWR is above the current lower

of having an extra symmetry that distinguishes Φ from its charged conjugated Φ̃ and, as
such, forbids the operator QL Φ̃ QR from appearing in the tree-level Lagrangian above. In
our case, this symmetry is U (1)P Q . Additionally, since the eq. (5.1) does not present a
Majorana mass term for the neutral fermion singlets SαR , some neutrinos remain massless.

Quark masses: suppressed quark mixing

With the introduction of the higher-dimensional operators in eq. (5.2) in addition to those
in eq. (5.1), the up and down-type quark mass matrices, written according to uL Mu uR

with  ≡ vσ /( 2Λ)  1. Such mass matrices are no longer proportional to each other due
to the contributions suppressed by . In this way our model predicts that the non-trivial
mixing angles of the new CKM matrix vanish when the suppression factor  approaches
zero, providing thus a natural explanation to the “flavour alignment” puzzle.
The effective operators in eq. (5.2), leading to a small departure from alignment, are
expected to come from a UV-complete theory upon the integration of heavy degrees of

– 10 –

freedom. In ref. [19], for example, a UV-complete model featuring, among other new
fields, heavy coloured scalars explains the observed small departure from flavour alignment
as a result of it being generated at loop level only.
In general, the matrices in eq. (5.3) can be diagonalised following the transformations
uL(R) → UL(R) u0 L(R) , dL(R) → DL(R) d0 L(R) , where UL(R) and DL(R) are unitary matrices, and the primed fields represent the physical states. The imposition of C as the LR
symmetry, as described by eq. (2.4), implies that the left and right transformations are
not independent but related via UR = U∗L K∗u and DR = D∗L K∗d , with Ku , Kd diagonal
matrices of phases. Also, the CKM matrix can be defined as VCKM ≡ VL = U†L DL .
There is enough freedom in the parameter space to easily accommodate all the quark
masses and mixing. For instance, the values below can be used as benchmarks to fit the
data:

For n large, the following hierarchy is obtained mR  mD  µ, which together with the
texture of the mass matrix in eq. (5.7) allows for the inverse seesaw to take place.
Neutrino masses are then obtained by diagonalising the mass matrix in eq. (5.7) with
the help of the unitary matrix U which can divided into two matrices: U = U1 U2 . Making
use of the fact that mR  mD  µ, we can write U1 as

eq. (5.15) when n = 4 without the need for any unnaturally small coupling in y or h. On
the other hand, for n < 4, sub-eV masses require h to be very small when compared to y;
whereas for n > 4, y needs to be more and more suppressed with respect to h.
We set n = 4 and, in the Appendix C, provide a point in the parameter that shows

solution presents normal mass ordering of the active neutrinos which is currently favoured
over the inverted ordering case [29–31].
Finally, we would like to stress out the importance of the PQ symmetry for the generation of neutrino masses. The smallness of the active neutrino masses follow from their
dependence on the PQ scale, vσ , through the suppression factor , rather than from a
strong dependence on the largeness of the scale vR , as it is common when the type-I seesaw mechanism is in place. Therefore, all the current neutrino data can be successfully
reproduced by our model even if the scale vR is only high enough to evade the constraints
from new vector boson searches. This is in contrast to ref. [19], where the type-I seesaw
mechanism is realised and the authors argue that only for values of vR ≥ 50 TeV can the
current neutrino data be fitted.

Neutrinoless double beta decay

New contributions to 0ν2β arise in the LR model in processes where WR is exchanged
instead of WL [32–35]. If the LR symmetry is broken at a very high scale, the new contributions can be neglected in favour of the standard one which is proportional to the
Majorana effective mass hmee i. In the present case, however, with vR = 15 TeV, WR as
well as the heavy neutrinos will get masses around the TeV scale, so that the contributions
to 0ν2β involving such particles may become relevant and therefore need to be checked.
In order to estimate the non-standard contributions, let us first write down, in the basis
where the charged leptons are diagonal, the interactions in the lepton sector mediated by
the charged gauge bosons WL and WR ,

processes in which we are interested, only interactions with (anti-)electrons are relevant,
thus we choose α = e.
The standard contribution to 0ν2β follows from the exchange of WL gauge bosons and
involve the Majorana masses of the left-handed neutrinos, as shown in the first diagram in
Fig. 1. The LR symmetry implies that the diagram in the centre of Fig. 1 also needs to
be taken into account as the right counterpart of the standard contribution. The mixing
between light and heavy neutrinos introduces another possibility shown in the last diagram
in Fig. 1. Contributions involving final electrons with opposite chiralities are also possible,
as we can see in Fig. 2.

and the effective Majorana mass is

(6.4)

which is a typical value for hmee i in the case of normal mass ordering.4 The mixing between
the charged gauge bosons WL and WR is ζ ' −1.3 × 10−5 . By calculating and comparing
all the contributions we have found that the standard Aν is by far the dominant one.
Whereas among the non-standard contributions, Aλ is the largest but still very small when
compared to Aν : |Aλ /Aν | ' 1.26 × 10−3 . Therefore, at least for this specific solution,
since the dominant contribution is the standard one governed by small effective Majorana
mass in eq. (6.4), no evidence for 0ν2β is expected to be observed in the next generation
experiments which will scan the region |hmee i| ∼ (0.01 − 0.05) eV [27, 31].

Lepton flavour violation and heavy neutrino constraints

We now discuss two important phenomenological implications of our model: lepton flavour
violation and heavy neutrino constraints. We start by considering lepton flavour violation
through the decays of a charged lepton into a different charged lepton plus a photon:
li → lj γ, since SM extensions featuring TeV scale neutrino mass mechanisms, like ours, can
induce large branching ratios for such decays. Among the possible decays, the constraint
on the muon decay is the strongest one with BR(µ+ → e+ γ) < 4.2 × 10−13 [36]. Whereas
the current upper limits for the branching ratio associated with tau decays, i.e. τ → µγ
and τ → eγ, are of order of 10−8 [37]. The branching ratio for these processes can be
written as [34]

The dominant contributions come from the terms in GγL , as defined by Eq. (D.2), except
for those proportional to |ζ|2 which are naturally too suppressed. It is clear from Eq. (7.2)

Several other solutions with similar or smaller hmee i values can also be easily found.

– 15 –

that our predictions for both tau decays are still quite far from the current experimental
limits. For the muon decay, on the other hand, the value we found is just below the current
upper limit. With the forthcoming MEG II experiment that aims at improving the current
BR(µ → eγ) limit by an order of magnitude, our prediction could be soon put to the test.
In addition to lepton flavour violation, the presence of heavy neutrinos that mix with
the active ones can lead to other distinctive experimental signatures. For example, collider
searches for events with three charged leptons (plus an active neutrino that escapes detection) arising from the decay of heavy neutrinos can be used to constrain how the latter
can mix with the active neutrinos. Searches for this signature have been performed using
the CMS detector at the LHC considering heavy neutrino masses from 1 GeV to 1.2 TeV
and decays mediated by WL [38]. According to our solution in Eq. (6.3), only the lightest
two among the heavy Majorana neutrinos, forming a quasi-Dirac pair with mass just above
530 GeV, are within the analysed mass range. The results presented in Ref. [38] require
the mixing between these heavy states and the first two active neutrinos to be smaller
than around 10−1 . The relevant mixing matrices for our benchmark solution are shown in
Eq. (C.12), from which we can conclude that the above constraint is easily satisfied since
the largest entries in Eq. (C.12) are no larger than 10−3 .
Finally, it is worth mentioning that if we had considered different benchmarks, other
processes could become more relevant to assess the viability of our results. For instance,
if at least one of the heavy neutrino masses was close to 125 GeV, the decay of the Higgs
boson into such a state plus an active neutrino would be kinematically allowed, which
would lead to constraints on the corresponding Dirac Yukawa couplings. For discussions
on this topic, see, for example, Refs. [39–41].

Conclusions

In this work, we have presented a minimal left-right model with a Peccei-Quinn symmetry
and shown how it can help us to understand the origin of two intriguing features, namely,
the approximately diagonal structure of the quark mixing (CKM) matrix and the smallness
of neutrino masses.
The scalar sector is composed of a gauge singlet, a SU (2)R and a SU (2)L doublet,
and a bi-doublet: σ, ηR , ηL and Φ, respectively. Symmetry breaking occurs in three
stages. Firstly, when the singlet acquires a vev, hσi ∝ vσ = 1011 GeV, the PQ symmetry
is spontaneously broken. The next step, SU (2)R ⊗ U (1)B−L → U (1)Y , is achieved by
hηR i ∝ vR = 15 TeV. At last, the SM group is broken by the two neutral components of Φ
that acquire vevs satisfying the relation (v12 + v22 )1/2 = vEW = 246 GeV. Step by step the
Higgs mechanism is at play and, in the end, six would-be Goldstone bosons are absorbed
by the gauge sector. The anomalous nature of the U (1)P Q symmetry, on the other hand,
gives rise to a pseudo-Goldstone boson instead, the axion a, upon its spontaneous breaking
by vσ . Furthermore, the strong CP problem is solved with the PQ mechanism, and the
axion with mass given by eq. (3.12) becomes a good cold dark matter candidate. Among
the remainder eleven scalar degrees of freedom, there exist a very heavy CP-even field,
Sσ , with mass proportional to vσ , and S1 , a 125 GeV Higgs boson, identified as the SM

– 16 –

one. All the other massive scalars, including two charged fields, H1± and H2± , get masses
proportional to the vR scale and can in principle be produced at colliders.
In the gauge sector of our LR model, we have twice as many massive gauge bosons as
in the SM, as expected. With vR = 15 TeV, the new neutral and charged gauge bosons,
with masses of 5.8 TeV and 4.9 TeV, respectively, are heavy enough to evade the current
experimental limits.
In the fermion sector, we have shown that since the U (1)P Q symmetry distinguishes
Φ from Φ̃, the corresponding tree-level CKM matrix presents no mixing and therefore
does not agree with what the experimental picture tells us. This issue has been solved by
considering non-renormalisable Yukawa interactions suppressed by the largest mass scale
in our model, Λ. With the new terms in the Yukawa sector proportional to the suppression
√
factor  = vσ /( 2Λ)  1, the resulting quark mixing has been shown to be naturally
small. By assuming a particular point in the parameter space, given by eq. (5.4) together
with the Appendix B, we have shown that our model can accommodate the current data
on quark masses and mixing. As for the leptons, the charged lepton masses come mainly
from renormalisable operators, while the neutrino masses depend directly on σ via higherorder operators. The inverse seesaw mechanism is implemented, so that in addition to
the three sub-eV active neutrinos, six TeV scale Majorana neutrinos, forming three quasiDirac pairs, are present. With the realisation of the inverse seesaw in our TeV scale
model, non-standard 0ν2β contributions, involving the new neutrinos and charged gauge
boson, can become sizeable and need to be checked. Considering the benchmark solution in
Appendix A, we have calculated the most relevant 0ν2β contributions and found that the
standard 0ν2β contribution, Aν , is by far the dominant one. Coming from a solution with
normal neutrino mass ordering, this contribution is, however, too small to be observed by
the upcoming 0ν2β experiments. New contributions to lepton flavour violating processes,
such as leptonic decays li → lj γ, also arise and can be large in our framework. For the
benchmark considered, the branching ratio for µ → eγ is found to be just below the current
experimental limit in a region that will soon be experimentally accessible.

Lepton sector benchmark

The active neutrino mass matrix in eq. (5.15) is diagonalised by the PMNS matrix (U)
which can be parametrised in terms of three mixing angles: θ12 , θ13 and θ23 , and three
phases δ, α21 and α31 . Below, we present a benchmark solution using the current best-fit
values for the U parameters as given in ref. [27].
This solution displays of a normal mass ordering and is obtained when the Yukawa
matrices in eq. (5.15) assume the following values
h = diag(1.688, 0.01747, 0.00254) ,



so that the active neutrino mass matrix eq. (5.12) is diagonalised by the U mixing matrix
defined in terms of its three mixing angles, a Dirac phase, for which we assume the best fit
values as in ref. [27]
sin2 θ12 = 0.297 , sin2 θ23 = 0.425 ,

sin2 θ13 = 0.0215 , δ = 1.38 π ,

Branching ratio for the process li → lj γ

We present here the branching ratios associated with the lepton flavour violating decays:
li → lj γ. We adapt the expressions given in Ref. [34] to our case, and consider, for simplicity, that the contributions mediated by gauge fields are dominant over those mediated
by the scalar fields. The latter fields can be taken to be heavier than WR without loss of
generality. The general expression is given by
