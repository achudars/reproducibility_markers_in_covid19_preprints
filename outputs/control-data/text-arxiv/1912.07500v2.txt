With the goal of studying the cosmological constant (CC) problem, we present an exhaustive
analysis of unimodular gravity as a possible candidate to resolve the CC origin and with this, the
current Universe acceleration. In this theory, a correction constant (CC-like) in the field equations
sources the late cosmic acceleration. This constant is related to a new parameter, zini , which is
interpreted as the redshift of CC-like emergence. By comparing with the CC value obtained from
Planck and Supernovaes measurements, it is possible to estimate zini = 11.15+0.01

11.43+0.03
respectively,
which

the observational

Hubble data (OHD), Type Ia Supernovae (SnIa), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and the

parameters. A Joint analysis (OHD+SnIa+BAO+CMB), results in zini = 11.47+0.074
−0.073 within 1σ
confidence level consistent with our estimation from Planck and Supernovae measurements. We also
include linear perturbations, starting with scalar and tensor perturbations and complementing with
the perturbed Boltzmann equation for photons. We show that the 00 term in the UG field equations
and the Boltzmann equation for photons contains corrections, meanwhile the other equations are
similar as those obtained in standard cosmology.

INTRODUCTION

Universe acceleration is one of the most intriguing conundrums in modern cosmology [1–3]. This feature has
been confirmed not only by Supernovae of the Type Ia
(SnIa), but also with observations related to Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Radiation [4], among others1 . Nowadays there is a concentration of efforts to
understand the physics (at macro and micro scales) responsible for such acceleration (see [7, 8] for a compilation of models) and its consequences in the Universe
evolution. Despite that many hypotheses have been put
on the table, the best candidate is still the cosmological constant (CC), an essential ingredient in the ΛCDM

Chronometers [5] and Strong Gravitational Lensing (SGL) [6]
to test theoretical models related with the Universe acceleration.

model representing the ∼ 69% of the total components
in the Universe [4]. One feature of CC is that it is imposed in the Einstein field equations, sustained only by
the Lovelock’s theorem [9], and its energy density value is
adjusted by cosmological observations to reproduce the
expected Universe dynamics. Nevertheless, the physics
of the CC is still unknown and the preferred interpretation is that CC is associated with the quantum vacuum
fluctuation of the space-time due to its auto-gravitating
characteristics [10, 11]. This hypothesis leads to one of
the biggest discrepancies between theory and observation in modern physics, because the theoretical prediction according to quantum field theory is ∼ 120 orders of
magnitude greater than the obtained from cosmological
observations [10, 11].
On the other hand, unimodular gravity (UG) proposes
an interesting and natural origin of the CC [12–17], since
it appears as an integration constant, which can be chosen without extra hypothesis and estimated with cosmological observations. This particular permissiveness

2
comes from the consideration that the determinant of
the metric is a constant invariant volume form, reducing
the degrees of freedom via diffeomorphism invariance in
the Einstein-Hilbert action and allowing a non gravitating CC. Using a constrained Hamiltonian dynamic, it is
possible to show that UG has the same number of degrees
of freedom than General Relativity (GR), even though it
has less symmetries, and thus avoiding the problems that
other theories encounter when working with third order
derivatives [18]. In addition, UG does not generate a
natural energy-momentum conservation and its assumption should be imposed as an extra hypothesis, reducing
it automatically to the traditional Einstein field equations plus the integration constant discussed above [14].
However, from our point of view, such extra hypothesis
reduces important characteristics of UG, making blurry
some aspects that could lead us to a most profound theory of the space-time itself while maintaining the CC in
the same mystery as in the standard paradigm.
A radical point of view is to disregard the traditional
hypothesis of energy-momentum conservation (as previous works do [13, 14]), allowing a new mathematical
structure of conservation which not only contains the
energy-momentum tensor but also the Ricci and energymomentum scalar, and whose structure emerges naturally from the UG field equations without extra hypothesis. This new standpoint gives a mechanism to understand the CC from a different perspective, resolving the
value of the energy density and tracing its presence as far
as the epoch of electro-weak transition [16, 17]. Indeed,
in this approach the CC can be interpreted as a cumulative small violation of the energy-momentum conservation, which in turn should be understood as granularity
of the space-time structure [17], being a possible evidence
of a quantum space-time.
In addition, UG could be the candidate to extend GR
because is compatible with observations of gravitational
waves [19, 20] or super massive black holes [21] and could
be the key to explore the quantum regime [22, 23] or even
the quantum gravity realm [16, 17]. As final comments,
the UG theory has not only been tested in cosmology but
also in compact objects to constrain the violation of the
energy-momentum conservation and its consequences in
astrophysics [24].
In this vein, in Ref. [25] the authors describe the CC in
the unimodular gravity context, obtaining a constant parameter related to the equation of state of radiation. This
new radical approach suggests that the causative of Universe acceleration is a constant related to the violation
of the energy-momentum conservation at a given component, such as radiation, which emerges at a redshift zini ,
close the reionization epoch. Another characteristic is
that, unlike GR, unimodular gravity can provide an Universe acceleration without invoking an exotic fluid with a
negative equation of state (EoS), which is an important
advantage in comparison with GR. In addition, reference
[25] suggests that the physics at early times could be different from the physics at late times due to the emergence

of this new constant term that later will act like an effective CC (hereafter CC-like). Hence, this constant term
in Friedmann equations should be the smoking gun of
the model that could be detected in future experiments
in order to refute or validate it. In this paper, we constrain the free parameters of the model through diverse
observation (OHD, SnIa, CMB and BAO data) concluding that the epoch of CC-like emergence should be in the
reionization epoch as pointed out (based in CMB data)
by Ref. [25], contributing with observational evidence of
these assertions. Even demonstrating that there is no
tension between the different data samples strengthening the presented model. Moreover, we discuss diverse
phenomena that could lead to understand the emergence
of the CC-like, such as those related to the continuous
spontaneous localization. Finally, this particular scenario
of emergent models (see for example [26]) could give us
clues about the tension between the Hubble constant values estimated from the early and the late Universe data
[27] (see also [28–30]).
On the other hand, linear perturbations in UG are required to study those effects related to the growth of
structure, the CMB power spectrum, among others, and
to develop a comparison with the standard perturbations
that rise from standard cosmology under GR context.
Recently, in [31], the authors studied linear perturbations with only a scalar field concluding that UG and GR
are similar at this level. However, the result is centered
in adding the hypothesis that ∇µ [(R + 8πGT )gµν ] = 0,
which is an extra assumption and directly converge to
GR with subtle changes. Here, we develop linear perturbations in the Newtonian gauge line element to scalar
and tensor perturbations, showing that the 00 component
contains an extra term that involves the perturbations
for Ricci and energy-momentum scalars, meanwhile the
ij component and tensor perturbations are identically to
those predicted by GR. In contrast, the Boltzmann equation for photons is exposed because it contains the energy
momentum violations that characterize the UG. Notoriously, the extra term carries higher order derivatives in
the conformal time component for the scale factor and
for the scalar curvature. If we add the extra hypothesis
that the derivative of the extra term in UG is equal to
zero, we recover the standard linear equations for GR. A
new jerk function must be constructed in order to follow
the paths of the homogeneous and isotropic scenario previously discussed and help us to discern among spurious
solutions caused by third order derivatives.
The present paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II
we present a review of UG based in previous studies. In
Sec. III we constrain UG free parameters through OHD,
SnIa, CMB posterior distances and BAO samples; containing at the end the respectively results of this section.
In Sec. IV we present the equations associated to linear perturbations, dividing our study in scalar, tensor
perturbations and the Boltzmann equations for photons,
finalizing with a resume of the results at perturbative
level. Finally, in Sec. V we give some conclusions and

3
outlooks.

REVIEW ON BACKGROUND COSMOLOGY
WITH UG

Unimodular gravity can be described by the following
field equation


Rµν − gµν R = 8πG Tµν − gµν T ,

where all the tensors are the standards of GR and G is
the Newton’s gravitational constant. This equation can
be deduced formally
by Einstein-Hilbert action under the
√
consideration −g = ξ, where ξ is a constant.
In order to study the background cosmology, we consider an isotropic, homogeneous and flat FriedmannLemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric2 , ds2 =
−dt2 + a(t)2 d~x2 , where a is the scale factor, the perfect fluid energy momentum tensor is written as Tµν =
pgµν + (ρ + p)uµ uν , where p, ρ and uµ are the pressure,
density and four-velocity of the fluid respectively. Hence,
the integrability for FLRW metric in UG give us [13, 14]

where the dots stands for time derivative. In addition, a
general conservation for UG theory is now written in the
form
∇µ [32πGTµν − (R + 8πGT )gµν ] = 0.

(3)

Without independently assuming the energy momentum
conservation (∇µ Tµν = 0), the Eq. (3) introduces new
Friedmann, acceleration and fluid equations coupled with
third order derivatives in the scale factor due to second
order derivatives in the Ricci scalar. Hence, in the case
of non traditional conservation of the energy-momentum
tensor, Eq. (3) must be solved to obtain the characteristic fluid equation. Hence, solving for (3) under a FLRW
metric and perfect fluid we have

and j ≡ a /aH 3 is the Jerk parameter (JP) [33, 34],
well known in cosmography and proposed by [25] for the
study of UG. The jerk parameter is the key ingredient
to avoid problems with the initial-values related to third

An important clarification is that a change of variables (such as
a → b1/4 and dt → b−3/4 dτ ), applied by [32] to FLRW metric to
maintain the UG constraint, does not modify the mathematical
consistency and it only impacts the physical interpretation (see
details in [25] appendix).

physical meaning, because of its well-known behavior.
The idea of the jerk parameter will be discussed later.

UG as

be used as free parameter as discussed later. √
The constant term is possible because in UG we have −g = ξ,

the Universe acceleration happens when
R Although
H 2 (j − 1)a−1 da > 2πG(ρ + p), which allows common
fluids to accelerate the Universe, the presence of the scale
factor in the expression restrict the acceleration epoch.
According to [25], it is plausible to consider an ansatz
for the JP in terms of the redshift with the following
characteristics
j(z) =

9(1 + w)w
Ω0i (z + 1)3(w+1) + 1,
2E(z)2

(8)

where w is the EoS for any fluid. This expression for
the jerk is not unique (other equations could be considered) and it is proposed to fulfill Eq. (4). Notice how
the function reproduce both the acceleration (driven by
a cosmological constant) and the matter stages. If we
additionally choose Ω0i → Ω0r and w → wr = 1/3,
this expression for the jerk will also reproduce the radiation stage and, in combination with the other stages,
the ΛCDM jerk in all eras [25]. Physically, the jerk parameter is a guide to reproduce the different stages because it involves third order derivatives of the scale factor.
It also produce the expected expansion for the enthalpy
(∝ a−4 ) as suggested in [35]. In summary, this choice
for the jerk parameter not only recreates the benefits of
ΛCDM model and alleviate the problems associated with
the initial conditions, but also unveils some aspects of the

4
nature of CC-like, i.e. introducing advantages over the
standard cosmological model.
As mentioned previously, a crucial characteristic is
that this jerk parameter could come from third order
derivatives in the equations of a more fundamental theory of space-time (allowing the violation of the energymomentum conservation) or by effects in the measurement problem in quantum mechanics (QM) as argued
by [16]. For example, regarding space-time, the jerk
could be originated by the causal sets (CS) approach to
quantum gravity [15], where in the cosmological context
the diffusion in the phase-space leads to the violation of
the energy-momentum conservation. Alternatively, the
jerk parameter could emerge from the continuous spontaneous localization (CSL), also related to the measurement problem in QM, which is connected to energy divergences in quantum collapse models, establishing a correlation with UG as it is shown in [15, 36, 37]. In addition,
Corral et al. [38] tackle the problem by arguing that the
jerk parameter presented in Eq. (8) could be a diffusion
parameter Q in the equation of state, which would mimic
the Universe acceleration.
From the previous equation and Eq. (5) it is possible
to deduce
E(z)2 = Ω0m (z + 1)3 + Ω0r (z + 1)4
+Ω0exs (zini + 1)4 ,

(9)

where E(z) ≡ H(z)/H0 , Ω0exs ≡ wr Ω0r and zini comes
from the constant term in the Eq. (7) integral. It is
worth mentioning that we have the following relation

zini = −1 +

1 − Ω0m − Ω0r
wr Ω0r

1/4
,

(10)

coming from the flatness condition. Notice that the
source of the Universe acceleration is the constant term
in the previous equation (Eq. 9), which is a combination of Ω0exs and zini , in where we can naturally relate
Ω0Λ → Ω0exs (zini + 1)4 . Since our choice in Eq. (8) depends on the EoS and the energy density parameter of
the radiation, the constant inherits those terms. An upper limit for zini can be established through the equation
zini + 1 <

−1/4
Ω0exs ,

−6 −2

(11)

hence, for Ω0exs = 8.23 × 10 h (1 + 0.2271g∗ ), being
g∗ = 3.04 the standard number of relativistic species [39],
and h is the dimensionless Hubble constant. This result
is dictated under the assumption that Ω0Λ = Ω0exs (zini +
1)4 < 1, obtaining an upper limit for zini to be zini <
12.54 at 95% confidence level (CL), using Planck mission
value h = 0.6766+0.0042
−0.0042 [4] (notice that the result for
this constriction is strongly dependent of what h value is
considered).
ΛCDM model (which our theory mimics) considers
the reionization era in the region 6 < z < 20, predicting a ionization fraction of ∼ 0.2 at z ∼ 12 (see
Ref. [40] for details). On the other hand, in order to

agree with the expected value for Ω0Λ in GR, we reCM B

quire that zini

that the CC-like origin is approximately at the epoch of
reionization in the late Universe3 , which is one of the
most important results of this theory. It is worth to
notice that these results are under the assumption that
+0.0042
Ω0Λ = 0.6889+0.0056
−0.0056 and h = 0.6766−0.0042 are taken
from Ref. [4]. Having said that, if we use the value
of Hubble constant from SnIa data measured by [41]
(h = 0.7422+0.0182
−0.0182 ), the result differs from the one from
Planck as expected. Hence, using this h estimation and
assuming that Ω0Λ coincide with the Planck value4 , we

BACKGROUND COSMOLOGICAL
CONSTRICTIONS

At background level the parameters zini and h can
be constrained by performing a Bayesian Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis employing OHD, SnIa,
CMB and BAO data.
To perform the MCMC analysis, we use the emcee
Python module [43] choosing a flat prior over all the
parameters in the range h : [0.2, 1.0], Ωb h2 : [0, 0.04],
Ω0m : [0, 1]. To establish a bound over the parameter
zini , we use Eq. (10). We set a burn-in phase to achieve
the convergence according to Gelman-Rubin criteria [44]
and 4000 MCMC steps with 250 walkers.
Then, we build a Gaussian log-likelihood as the meritof-function to minimize −2 log(Ldata ) ∝ χ2data , for each
dataset mentioned previously. Additionally, a joint analysis can be constructed through the sum of them, i.e.,
χ2Joint = χ2SnIa + χ2OHD + χ2CMB + χ2BAO ,

where subscripts indicate the observational measurements under consideration. The rest of the section is
devoted to describe the different cosmological observations.

In Ref. [16], the CC can be traced from electroweak epoch,
due to some specific quantum violation related to the energymomentum tensor.
In general, this assumption is not true, however Riess et al. [42]
does not report the expected value for Ω0Λ in the Supernovaes
observations.

Recently, [31] performed a further perturbative analysis of the UG model. They found that, at first and second order of perturbative level, there are no differences
between ΛCDM and UG, hence the UG theory is not
excluded by measuring either the growth factor, CMB
lensing or the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. Therefore,
as a first approach, we consider the CMB posterior distances from ΛCDM to test this model.

Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) are considered as
standard rulers, being primordial signatures of the interactions between baryons and photons in a hot plasma
on the matter power spectrum in the pre-recombination
epoch. In Ref. [47], the authors collected 15 transversal

galaxies located in the region 0.110 < z < 2.225.

by authors like in Ref. [53]. Furthermore, CSL or CS,

Results at Background Level

Table I provides the mean values for h and zini obtained from each data set and a joint analysis. Furthermore, Figure 1 presents the 1D marginalized posterior
distributions and 2D at 68%, 95%, 99.7% of CL for the
UG parameters. The results for the five cases confirm
that zini ∼ 12; hence, we conclude that the CC-like
should emerge in the reionization epoch (see [40]) in contrast to the standard cosmological model where the CC
is always present.
More precisely, the joint analysis estimates zini =

+0.03

−0.07 , while zini = 11.15−0.02 and 11.43−0.06 are
those obtained with the h values from Planck, and SnIa
measurements respectively. Note that the 4.6σ between
CMB and the joint analysis is due that we choose the
value of h given by Riess et al. [42] instead the presented by Planck [4]. As mentioned before, these values lie on the reionization region (6 < z < 20) [48]
(see [40] for other regions with diverse conditions), and
are also in agreement with recent measurements [49] by
the Shaped Antenna of the background Radiation Spectrum (SARAS), which ruled out reionization in the region 10 < z < 6. Several important events happened at
that time such as the apparition of high-redshift galaxies
[48] or the birth of the first stars in the Universe, the
so-called Population III stars [50–52]. In that epoch, the
combination of the above mentioned mechanisms reionize
the intergalactic medium initiating the process of metallicity in the Universe (and bringing the end of the socalled dark ages epoch). We remark that this epoch is
particularly important because non linear physics processes are involved. We speculate that the friction of
non linear structures (galaxies, clusters, etc) with the
granularity of the space-time could have helped to the

We dedicate this section to elucidate the equations
associated to the linear perturbations for UG, starting
with the field equations and later on with the Boltzmann
equations, centering our attention in the photons case
because, as discussed in the previous section, this is the
equation coupled with the jerk parameter.
In order to study the equations associated to the linear
perturbations, we rewrite Eq. (1) in the form
1
Gµν + (R + 8πGT )gµν = 8πGTµν ,
4

(22)

where Gµν ≡ Rµν − 21 gµν R, is the Einstein tensor.
We start using the conformal Newtonian gauge line
element given by the components
g00 (t, x) = −1 + h00 (t, x),
g0i (t, x) = a(t)h0i (t, x),
gij (t, x) = a2 (t)[δij + hij (t, x)],

(23)
(24)
(25)

where hµν  1, are metric perturbations.

A.

Scalar Perturbations

For this particular case, we reduce the above equations to h00 (t, x) = −2Ψ(t, x), h0i = 0 and hij (t, x) =
2δij Φ(t, x), where Ψ(t, x) and Φ(t, x) are the Newtonian
and curvature potential, respectively.
The first equation that we present is associated with
the 00 component, therefore we have the following parts

that

here the equations are transformed to the conformal time
through the relation dt = adη, primes denote derivatives
with respect to η (0 = ∂η ) and H is the Hubble parameter
in conformal time. Notice that when Λ(η, k) = C, where
C  1 is a constant small perturbation, the equation that
rise from GR plus a constant should be recovered. However, this is no trivial, because the previous imposition,
generates another constraint over the functions that contains (31). The hypothesis and mathematical arguments
used to infer Λ(η, k) = C needs the Boltzmann equations
discussed later.
On the other hand, for the ij equations we use the
longitudinal traceless (LT) part of Gij denoted by k̂i k̂ j −
(1/3)δij . Considering that the term (R + 8πGT )/4 contains a product with δji , this is neglected by the LT consideration, therefore the final form is equal to those expected by GR

Tensor Perturbations

For tensor perturbations, we begin describing the metric components as h00 = −1, h0i = 0 and
δgij (t, x) = a(t)2 hij (t, x),

(39)

thus,

Therefore, the linear tensor perturbations does not show
any difference with the one from GR.
C.

Boltzmann equations

As we discussed previously, Eq. (4) is the main
equation for the fluids with the sum indicating that all
the components considered in the cosmology should be
added. For the matter component (with p = 0), the well
know equation ρ̇m +3Hρm = 0 is directly recovered, while
for the radiation component the jerk is designed ad-hoc
in such a way that the equation ρ̇r + 4Hρr = 0 for relativistic particles is recovered. Thus, it is expected that
linear perturbations of Boltzmann equation for photons
should carry the information encrypted in the j term,
even in the free streaming epoch when Compton process
could be safely neglected. In this epoch, the particle density is low, implying that the
R optical depth is negligible
(τ  1) and defined as τ = ne σT adη, being ne the electron number density and σT the Thompson cross section
and hence, the interaction part described by the collision
function C[f (p)] will not play a role.
From Eq. (3) it is possible to observe that ∇µ Tµν =
∂ν F(R, T ), being ∂ν F(R, T ) a function that involves

8
derivatives of the Ricci and energy-momentum scalars
(the function absorbs the factor (32πG)−1 ), which implies higher order derivatives as it is shown in equation
(4) encrypted in the jerk parameter. However, notice
that the derivatives are only depending on time because
ρ and p only depends on t, therefore we have ∂t F(R, T )
and then we arrive to Eq. (4).
Consequently, if photons carry the violations to the energy momentum tensor5 , we expect that the linear perturbed equations in conformal time with τ  1, will take
the form
Θ0 + ikµΘ + Φ0 + ikµΨ = ∂η F̃(δR, δT ),

(40)

where kµ = k · p̂, and p̂ is the momentum direction,
Θ ≡ δT /T is the photon perturbations, which cause differences in the temperature, and F̃ is the perturbed part
of the function F, involving δR and δT given by Eqs.
(27) and (29) for the scalar perturbations. Then, we have
for a scalar energy-momentum tensor composed only by
photons

D.

UG equations at perturbative level are presented, implementing the conformal Newtonian gauge line element,
showing the scalar and tensor perturbations as well as the
Boltzmann equation for photons. It is notorious that the
scalar perturbations for 00 contains a term Λ(η, k), not
expected in standard GR, promoting another constriction into UG equations. Regarding the ij component,
for scalar perturbations and due to the LT consideration, Eq. (32) maintains the same form as the one shown
in GR. In the case of linear tensor perturbations, we conclude that the equations do not change, having the same
result as predicted by GR.
On the other hand, it is possible to deduce the Boltzmann equation for the photons, assuming a negligible
optical depth, i.e. no Compton scattering. The left side
of the equation is the same as the one expected in standard cosmology, meanwhile the right side will contain a
function that depends on δR, δT and higher order conformal temporal derivatives that now also involves the
spatial curvature Φ. In this case, Eq. (8) is not useful
as a guide to avoid problems with high order derivatives.
The classical way to solve this problem is to assume Eq
(41) is equal to zero, therefore Λ(η, k) = C, which justify
the previously mentioned assumption.
Therefore, UG provides an extra equation which reads

(41)
a00
k2
3 H +
−



Notice that the derivatives involve the conformal time
parameter, then, from Eq. (27) we will have higher order derivatives for a and Φ. Thus, if we want to obtain
the standard perturbations for GR, the equation (8) is
not useful anymore. In the same way, we need to propose a new jerk parameter in order to face the problems
associated with third order derivatives encoded in the
Boltzmann equation for photons.
As a final remark, we expect that the Boltzmann equations for the remaining species must be the same as these
obtained in the standard cosmology. Thus, the mathematical structure for the UG equations suggest that only
radiation (at background level) and photons (at perturbative level) are the only species coupled with the non
conservative term. While we increase the energy, the
Compton scattering appears and therefore, Eq. (40)
must contain the term −τ 0 [Θ0 − Θ + ub µ], where ub is
the bulk velocity. Regarding the initial conditions associated to the inflationary process, those must be studied in
a future work because, unlike the GR case, the analysis
requires extra contributions.

5

Results at Perturbative Level

At background level, we only claim that radiation (relativistic
particles) carry the energy-momentum violation, but we do not
specify if those are the photons or the neutrinos. Here, we are
adding another extra hypothesis assuming that photons specifically carry energy-momentum violations.

We will call it the constriction equation for UG.
Conversely, we can face Eq. (41) which implies dealing
with higher order derivatives. In this case, the strategy
should be the same as the one for the homogeneous Universe, i.e. find a well known function as a guide (the jerk
function). A direct manipulation of Eq. (40) generates
the following integro-differential equation, as it happens

CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOKS

Unimodular gravity, and its particular and natural
characteristic of violating the traditional form of the

9
energy-momentum conservation, not only suggests the
apparition of the CC-like term together with its radiation inherited characteristics (which is assumed coupled
with the jerk parameter), but also the redshift at which
it emerges. In this scenario, the CC-like arises during the
epoch of reionization, when the newly form galaxies and
stars of the Population III reionizated the intergalactic
medium and, in general, when complex structures played
a role in the cosmological dynamics and converting the
Universe into a highly non-linear entity.
Towards redshifts of the order z & 11, the CC-like
should generate a fingerprint that could be detected in
future observations. Hence, a particular form to refute
or validate the model is the prediction that CC does
not exist in all stages of the evolution of the Universe,
but it arises during the epoch of reionization, being the
smoking-gun epoch to obtain evidence of CC and elucidate its future implications for the Universe evolution.
Models like UG where it is predicted a late CC, are
called emergent which the capability to alleviate the recent problem related with observations of H0 at late and
early cosmological times [27].
We constrained the UG parameters using OHD, SnIa,
CMB and BAO data, together with a joint analysis. Our
main result estimates a value for zini (Joint) of 11.473, in
good agreement with the theoretical values (11.5, 11.43)
using h measured by Planck 2018 and [42]; strengthening
our conclusions that important physics should emerge in
the reionization epoch6 . Furthermore, the estimated values for parameter zini are in agreement for the data used,
which points towards a robust model at the background
level and motivates the study of other aspects (such as
growth structure at perturbative level, etc).
Moreover, the Experiment to Detect the Global Epoch
of reionization (EDGES, [54]) detects an interesting event
at a redshift closer to the one we obtain (z ∼ 12): an
excess of radiation centered at z ≈ 17 and spanning a region 20 > z > 15. Thus, the EDGES event is consistent
with our predictions and it could represent the detection of the CC-like emergence. However, we caution that
EDGES result is still in the center of a controversy [49],
thus, we should wait for new experiments to confirm or
refute the observations.
Despite that UG sheds light into the nature of the CC
and establishes a redshift for its possible presence, it is
not clear why the CC-like emerges at the epoch of reionization. One possibility is that the non linearity in that
epoch generates some kind of symmetry breakdown by
a still unknown process and this, in turn, leads to the
presence of the CC-like originated by the violation of the
energy-momentum conservation, resulting in the acceler-

ation of the Universe. As we argue previously, we suspect
that non linear physics play an important role in the formation of complex structure (such as stars and galaxies),
generating friction with a possible non-continuous spacetime and provoking the apparition of the CC-like. The
latter assertion could be compatible with CS paradigm
or even CSL as we discussed previously.
Cosmological linear perturbations in UG is another
subject that is studied in this paper. Under the Newtonian conformal gauge we present scalar and tensor perturbations, together with the Boltzmann equation for
photons. Under this scenario, we show how the 00 component for scalar perturbations, presents an extra contribution call it Λ(η, k), meanwhile the ij and tensor perturbations remains equal as those obtained by GR. As
it is expected, the Boltzmann equation for photons, contains an additional term that contains third order derivatives, not only in the scale factor (as happens in the background) but also to the scalar curvature. The additional
hypothesis of consider that Eq. (41) tends to zero, give
us the constriction equation for UG. However, if we face
the problem of third order derivatives, it is necessary to
solve Eq. (43) (coupled with the other fluids and field
equations), which is an integro-differential equation for
photons. Formally, it is the Boltzmann equations for
photons in UG scenario. As a final remark we mention
that it is not possible to generate a numerical analysis of
the linear perturbations presented previously and with
this, the matter power spectrum, before study the initial
conditions in this scenario (inflationary Universe), which
will be studied elsewhere.
Finally, the confirmation of this model would not only
open the door to understand the current Universe acceleration, but also could be a piece of evidence for the possible granularity or other primordial effects of the spacetime itself.
