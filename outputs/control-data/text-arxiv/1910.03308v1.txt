Abstract
Recent large-area, deep CO surveys in the Galactic disk have revealed the formation of ∼50 highmass stars or clusters triggered by cloud-cloud collisions (CCCs). Although the Galactic Center (GC)
—which contains the highest volume density of molecular gas— is the most favorable place for cloud
collisions, systematic studies of CCCs in that region are still untouched. Here we report for the first time
evidence of CCCs in the common foot point of molecular loops 1 and 2 in the GC. We have investigated
the distribution of molecular gas toward the foot point by using a methodology for identifying CCCs,
and we have discovered clear signatures of CCCs. Using the estimated displacements and relative
velocities of the clouds, we find the elapsed time since the beginnings of the collisions to be 105−6
yr. We consider possible origins for previously reported peculiar velocity features in the foot point and
discuss star formation triggered by CCCs in the GC.

1 Introduction
1.1 Cloud-cloud collisions and the Galactic Center

Due to the rapid compression of the molecular gas, a cloud-cloud collision (CCC) is a triggering
mechanism for the formation of massive clumps that may become high-mass stars or a star cluster.
1

Habe & Ohta (1992) performed axisymmetric numerical hydrodynamics calculations of supersonic,
head-on collisions between non-identical clouds, and they showed that a collision between two molecular clouds with supersonic relative velocities generates a compressed layer at the collision front.
Inoue & Fukui (2013) pointed out that enhanced turbulence in the compressed layer increases the
effective sound speed and consequently the effective Jeans mass. Recent large-area, deep CO surveys
of the Galactic disk have revealed ∼50 objects containing high-mass stars that were formed via rapid
gas compression by a CCC (e.g., super star clusters: Furukawa et al. 2009; Fukui et al. 2013, Galactic
open clusters: Torii et al. 2011; Enokiya et al. 2018). Also, in extreme cases CCCs can trigger star
bursts like those seen in mergers such as the Antennae (Wilson et al. 2000), although the detailed
mechanism by which this occurs is still unclear.
The central kpc of the Galaxy (i.e., the Galactic Center: GC) contains ∼10 % of the entire
molecular contents of the Milky Way, and hence it is natural to expect clouds in the GC to collide with
each other more frequently than in the Galactic disk. To elucidate the differences and coincidences
between normal CCCs seen in the disk and the extreme CCCs seen as a star burst, a systematic
analysis to probe for evidence of CCCs in the GC is strongly desired. The molecular complex in
the central 200 pc, called the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ: Morris & Serabyn 1996), contains
the highest volume density of molecular gas in the Galaxy; that is to say, it appears to be the most
favorable place for CCC to occur. Indeed, Hasegawa et al. (1994) discovered evidence for a CCC
in the Sgr B2 molecular complex. However, the velocity structure of the CMZ is generally fairly
complicated, and it is quite difficult to distinguish colliding features from other velocity structures,
such as high velocity compact clouds (Oka et al. 1998; Takekawa et al. 2019). For this reason, the
CMZ is not the most suitable region to explore for CCCs in the GC as the very first step.

1.2 Magnetic flotation loops in the GC

There are four noteworthy CO condensations with large velocity dispersions in the GC in addition
to the CMZ; namely, Bania’s clumps 1 and 2, the L5.5 clump, and the common foot point of loops
1 and 2 (Bania 1977; Bitran et al. 1997; Fukui et al. 2006). The nature of most of these massive
clumps is still under debate. Only the origin of the third-brightest clump in the CO intensity map,
—the common foot point of loops 1 and 2, also known as M-3.8+0.9 (hereafter the foot point MC)—
is well understood; see Fukui et al. (2006) and subsequent observational and theoretical papers.
Fukui et al. (2006) discovered two huge molecular loops with a projected length of ∼300 pc
that connect with each other, and they proposed a magnetic flotation scenario due to the Parker instability (Parker 1966) seen in solar prominences, based on its linear distribution in the l − v diagram.
2

Torii et al. (2010a) carried out higher-resolution follow-up observations toward the foot point MC using Mopra, Aacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE), and NANTEN2. They discovered
not only the main component with VLSR < -50 km s−1 which was originally identified by Fukui et
al. (2006) as the foot point, but also a sub-component with VLSR ≥ -50 km s−1 that interacts with
the main component. These two components form U shapes (U shape 1 and 2) in the v − b diagram
(Figure 1). The investigators also discovered broad emission regions that display compact and broad
velocity features with a very high

12 CO

intensity ratio between J=3–2 and J=1–0 and that bridge

both sides of U shape 1 in the v − b diagram. They concluded that the broad emissions originate from
heating either by magnetic reconnection or by upward-flowing gas that bounced from the narrow neck
at the foot point. Torii et al. (2010b) and Kudo et al. (2011) carried out higher-J CO observations and,
by adopting a simple rotation-expansion kinematic model, they found that the observed, U-shaped
velocity feature corresponds to the spatial U shape of the gas at the point connecting loops 1 and 2.
From observations of SiO(J=2–1) and from mid-infrared spectroscopy, respectively, Riquelme et al.
(2010) and Kaneda et al. (2012) discovered possible evidence for shock heating at the foot point, as
originally proposed by Fukui et al. (2006). Recently, through 3 mm line observations from Mopra and
APEX, Riquelme et al. (2018) discovered the existence of slow, C-type shock waves with velocities
of 30 – 50 km s−1 at the foot point.
Some numerical magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations have successfully reproduced
the magnetic loops induced by the Parker instability (in two-dimensions, Takahashi et al. 2009; in
three-dimensions: Machida et al. 2009; Suzuki et al. 2015; Kakiuchi et al. 2018). It is natural to expect
clouds sliding down along the magnetic field lines from the top of a loop to stagnate at the foot points,
thus increasing the chance of a CCC occurring there. From their numerical simulations, Matsumoto
et al. (1988) and Takahashi et al. (2009) found that shock waves are formed near the foot points of
the magnetic loops where the supersonically infalling gas hits the dense disk gas. Motivated by these
considerations, we have investigated the occurrence of CCCs in the foot point MC by applying our
recently developed CCC-identification methodology in order to link our understanding of CCCs, as
obtained from observations of the Galactic disk, to the GC.

1.3 Observational Signatures of Colliding Clouds

Fukui et al. (2018a) have presented a detailed identification methodology for CCCs. Here, we focus
only on the observational signatures of the colliding clouds. Assuming that the colliding clouds
have different sizes —because the chance of a collision between clouds of the same size is low—
the smaller cloud hollows out the larger cloud and makes a hole shaped like the smaller cloud in the
3

larger cloud. This creates a complementary distribution between the two clouds at different velocities,
unless the cloud is dispersed by ionization originating from the triggered high-mass stars. If the angle
between the direction of collision and the line of sight is zero degrees (i.e., for a head-on collision),
the smaller cloud coincides with the hole in the larger cloud. In most cases, however, the angle is
not zero, and the smaller cloud is displaced as a function of the angle and elapsed time relative to the
hole in the larger cloud. In velocity space, the two clouds show a bridging feature at the beginning of
the collision due to momentum exchange between them. This feature develops into a V shape in the
p − v diagram at a later stage of the collision. (For details, see Fukui et al. 2018a.) This implies that
the supersonic relative velocity of the two colliding clouds is converted into the velocity dispersion
of the clouds via a CCC. Consequently, CCCs with large inter-cloud velocity dispersions —as in the
GC — may form broad bridging features toward the colliding clouds. The most probable candidates
are the broad emission regions in the foot point MC.
By applying our CCC-identification methodology, in the present paper we provide for the
first time evidence for CCCs in the foot point of the magnetic flotation loops in the GC. We adopt a
distance of 8.0 kpc to the foot point MC. Details of the CO dataset we used are described in Section
2, and the results of our CO analyses are given in Section 3. We discuss the possible origins of CCCs,
as well as differences or coincidences between CCCs in the disk and in the GC, in section 4. We
summarize the present study in Section 5.

2 Data
2.1 12 CO(J =3–2)

In the present work, we have mainly used the 12 CO(J=3–2) dataset obtained by Torii et al. (2010a).
They carried out the observations in a position-switching mode with a 4000 grid spacing at the AST E
10-m telescope of the NAOJ (National Astronomical Observatory of Japan) at Pampa La Bola at an
altitude of 4800 m in Chile (Kohno 2005; Ezawa et al. 2004; 2008). The data coverage is limited
roughly to (l, b) = (356.◦ 0 to 356.◦ 3, 0.◦ 64 to 1.◦ 27), corresponding to the location of the foot point
MC. The HPBW (half-power beam width), the velocity resolution, and the rms noise temperature in
Tmb scale of the final data are 2200 , 1.0 km s−1 , and 0.29 K/km s−1 , respectively.
2.2 12 CO(J =1–0)

The 12 CO(J=1–0) dataset we used was also obtained by Torii et al. (2010a). The observations were
carried out in the on-the-fly mode at the Mopra 22-m telescope of the Australia Telescope National
Facility near Coonabarabran in Australia. We used this data only to derive the masses and column
4

densities of the molecular clouds, because the data coverage is slightly smaller and the angular resolution is coarser than that of the 12 CO(J=3–2) data. The HPBW, the velocity resolution, and the rms
noise temperature in Tmb scale of the final data are 5100 , 0.88 km s−1 , and 0.3 K/ch, respectively.

by Torii et al. (2010a) are indicated by blue lines and black dashed lines respectively. The transparent green belts indicate the velocity ranges defined in Section 3.1.

Figure 1 shows the velocity–latitude diagram for 12 CO(J=3–2), with the range of integration
extending over almost all longitudes. The velocity structures indicated by the thick, black, dashed
lines —corresponding to U shapes 1 and 2 —and by the thin, black, dashed lines —corresponding
to the broad emission regions—were previously introduced by Torii et al. (2010a). The two broad
emission regions at the lowest latitude form U shapes 1 and 2, while the higher-latitude feature is
a compact broad emission region. Here we call these three features broad emissions 1, 2, and 3
(indicated in the figure as BE 1, 2, and 3), from higher to lower latitude. Fortunately, emission
5

and absorption caused by foreground clouds along the line of sight are not seen significantly in this
complex, except for absorption at VLSR = 0 to 5 km s−1 . As reviewed in Section 1, a CCC is caused by
an encounter between two or more clouds with different velocities. Consequently, it is necessary to
determine how many velocity components the molecular complex has along the line of sight and how
they are distributed. The velocity ranges of the main component and the sub-component are quite
large, and we expect that both contain multiple velocity components. To distinguish pairs of clouds
with complementary spatial distributions in this complicated velocity structure, we defined the clouds
according to their velocities, based on the distribution in the first-moment map (Fukui et al. 2018a).

Figure 2a and b show the first-moment and second-moment maps of

12 CO(J=3–2)

in the

velocity range of the main component. Voxels with intensities less than 4σ are flagged in advance.
Figure 2a clearly shows the spatial distribution of the two components, the blue above b ∼ 0.◦ 8, and
the red below b ∼ 0.◦ 8. We defined the region where the blue component dominates as (l, b) =
(356.◦ 00 to 356.◦ 30, 0.◦ 84 to 1.◦ 20), as indicated by the dashed blue rectangle, and the region where
the red component dominates as (l, b) = (356.◦ 00 to 356.◦ 30, 0.◦ 64 to 0.◦ 80), as indicated by the dashed
red rectangle. By averaging the values inside each rectangle in the first-moment and the second
moment maps, we obtain the central velocities (Vcenter ) and velocity widths (dV ) for each component
(see Table 1). Here, we call these blue-shifted and red-shifted components “the main component 1”
6

and “main component 2”, respectively. Figure 2c and d show the first-moment and second-moment
maps of 12 CO(J=3–2) in the velocity range of the sub-component. Voxels with intensities less than
4σ are flagged in advance. The sub-component is clearly separated in space in both the first- and
second-moment maps. We defined the region dominated by the blue-shifted component as < -20
km s−1 corresponding to the interior of the white contour, and the red-shifted component as ≥ -20
km s−1 . By averaging the values for each region in the first-moment and second-moment maps, we
obtained the central velocities (Vcenter ) and velocity line widths (dV ) for each component (see Table
1). We call these blue-shifted and red-shifted components “sub-component 1” and “sub-component
2”, respectively. We also define the velocity-integration range where each component predominates
as Vcenter ± dV , although the clouds are more extended in velocity and connect with each other
kinematically to form the U shapes in the v − b diagram (see Table 1). Main component 1 includes
the blue-shifted component of U shape 1, and main component 2 includes the blue-shifted component
of the broad emissions and the blue-shifted component of U shape 2. sub-component 1 includes the
red-shifted component of the broad emissions and the bottoms of the U shapes, and sub-component 2
includes the red-shifted components of U shapes 1 and 2.

Fig. 3. (a-d) Integrated intensity distributions of main components 1 and 2 and sub-components 1 and 2 in 12 CO(J =3–2). The velocity-integration ranges are derived from the
moment maps (see details in text).

Figure 3 a–d show the integrated-intensity distributions of main components 1 and 2 and subcomponents 1 and 2. The velocity-integration range for each cloud corresponds to Vcenter ± dV . Main
component 1 is shaped like Swiss cheese. It contains a huge ∼40 pc molecular complex from b =
7

0.◦ 8 to 1.◦ 1, with three holes or depressions at (l, b) = (356.◦ 24, 1.◦ 02), (356.◦ 15, 1.◦ 01), and, (356.◦ 15,
0.◦ 94) (hereafter, holes 1, 2, and 3). Main component 2 exhibits a complicated morphology. The
upper half comes from a mixture of main component 1 and sub-component 1. The lower half exhibits
a concentration of molecular gas. sub-component 1 consists of the broad emission regions 1, 2, and 3
and a molecular complex at b < 0.◦ 9. The latter corresponds to the bottom of U shape 1 (Torii et al.
2010a). sub-component 2 exhibits a huge elliptical hole centered at (l, b) ∼ (356.◦ 18, 0.◦ 80), almost at
the center of the molecular cloud. This hole can be seen more clearly at VLSR from -10 to 10 km s−1
in Figure 15 in the Appendix.
To estimate the hydrogen mass and column density of each component, we utilize the following equations:
M = µm p ∑ [d 2 ΩNH2 ,i ].

(1)

i

where µ, m p , d, Ω and NH2 ,i are the mean molecular weight, proton mass, distance, solid angle
subtended a pixel, and column density of molecular hydrogen for the i-th pixel, respectively. We
assume a helium abundance of 20 %, which corresponds to µ = 2.8, and we take d = 8.0 kpc. The
column density of molecular hydrogen is given by Equation (2),
NH2 = X ×W (CO).

(2)

where W (CO) is the integrated intensity of 12 CO(J=1–0) and X is an empirical factor that converts
from W (CO) to NH2 . We adopt X = 0.7 × 1020 cm−2 (K km s−1 )−1 , as obtained by (Torii et al.
2010b) by comparing IRAS dust-emission data and CO datasets toward loops 1 and 2. From these
equations and the

12 CO(J=1–0)

dataset obtained with Mopra, we found the molecular masses for

main components 1 and 2 and sub-components 1 and 2 to be ∼ 2 × 105 M , ∼ 9 × 104 M , ∼ 8 × 104
M , and ∼ 8 × 104 M , respectively. The detailed physical parameters for each cloud are summarized
in Table 1. We used the end-to-end velocity of each cloud, shown as VLSR in Table 1, to derive the
mass and column density.

3.2 Pairs of Complementary Distributions among the Molecular Components

According to Fukui et al. (2018a) and references therein, the signatures of a CCC are the complementary distributions in space of the colliding clouds and a broad bridging feature or a V-shaped feature
connecting the clouds in velocity. To investigate evidence for CCCs in the foot point MC, we assess
the complementary distributions among the identified components in this subsection. We first take
particular note of the broad features 1, 2, and 3, because they may be candidates for bridging features.

Figure 4a shows the integrated

12 CO(J=3–2)

intensity distribution of sub-component 1 as

contours superposed on a background image of main component 1. We found that some of the holes
in main component 1 (the image) seem to fit some of the broad emissions. To estimate the relative
displacement between these components, we applied an algorithm developed by Fujita et al. (2019
in preparation). This algorithm determine a plausible displacement vector by calculating correlation
coefficients between the integrated intensity map of the hole cloud and that of the clump cloud with
an arbitrary displacement. The displacement vector with the most negative correlation coefficient is
consider to be the plausible displacement vector. By applying this algorithm, we found the magnitude
and angle of the displacement between this pair of components to be 4.20 pc and 213.69 degrees,
where a positive angle indicates counter-clockwise rotation from Galactic east. The black arrow in
9

Figure 4a represents this plausible displacement vector.
Figure 4b is the same as Figure 4a, but with the positions of the contours shifted by the displacement vector. This figure clearly exhibits complete correspondence between broad emission 1
and hole 1, and between broad emission 2 and hole 3. This is clear evidence of CCCs. Moreover, the
molecular complex at b < 0.◦ 9 also corresponds better with main component 1 in Figure 4b. Molecular
gas in the vicinity of broad emission 3 is tenuous, and we did not find any significant pairs of cloud
with a hole-shape in any other velocities, even though the emission connects main components 1 and
2 in velocity space, as shown by Figure1.

by the light green rectangle in the l − b map. The figure obviously shows that both pairs of clouds
make V shapes in the v − b diagrams, as indicated by the thick, black, dashed lines. This is another
signature of a CCC.
Secondly, we investigate other pairs of colliding clouds in the foot point MC between the main
and the sub-components.

concentration below b=0.◦ 85 in main component 2. Applying the algorithm again, we obtain the
magnitude and angle of the displacement of the pair of components to be 4.97 pc and 110.56 degrees.
The black arrow in Figure 6a is the plausible displacement vector derived by the algorithm. Figure 6b
shows the distribution shifted by this vector. In the velocity range of main component 2, emission from
main component 1 and sub-component 1 are contaminated at b > 0.◦ 85, and we therefore excluded
this region in deriving the displacement vector.

Figure 7 shows the longitude-latitude, and velocity-latitude distributions of the pair of candidate CCC sites between main component 2 and sub-component 2. The light green rectangle indicates
the longitude-integration range for the v − b diagram, and the blue and orange transparent belts indicate the respective velocity ranges of main component 2 and sub-component 2. As indicated by the
thick, black, dashed lines, the candidate clouds exhibit complementary spatial distributions, making
a V shape in the v − b diagram that is characteristic of a CCC. For this reason, it is possible that this
pair of clouds is also colliding with each other. This V shape is constructed from U shape 1 and U
shape 2 identified by (Torii et al. 2010a).

4 Discussion

In the previous section, we have shown that two pairs of velocity components (main component
1–sub-component 1, hereafter CCC1; and main component 2–sub-component 2, hereafter CCC2)
exhibit complementary distributions in space and V shapes in the v − b diagram. These are strong
evidence for current CCCs. In this section, we discuss detailed scenarios for these CCCs as well as
the differences or coincidences between CCCs in the Galactic disk and in the GC.

4.1 Collision timescale

A spatial displacement between a hole cloud and a clump cloud in a CCC is produced by the product
of the relative velocity toward the direction of the displacement vector and the elapsed time since
the collision. Assuming the relative velocity in the direction of the displacement is the same as their
relative velocity along the line of sight —58.7 km s−1 and 53.9 km s−1 — i.e., that the angle between
the line of sight and the collision direction is 45 degrees, we obtain the elapsed time —or collision
timescale— to be 4.2 pc / 58.7 km s−1 = ∼ 7 × 104 years for CCC1 and 4.97 pc / 53.9 km s−1 =
∼9 × 104 years for CCC2. This velocity assumption is commonly used for CCCs in the Galactic
disk, because the collision is caused by random motions of clouds within the velocity dispersion of
the spiral arm where the colliding clouds are located. On the other hand, the velocity of the foot
point MC is dominated by systematic down-flow motions along the magnetic field lines in loops 1
and 2 to the foot point. Thus, the relative velocity toward the displacement vector depends strongly on
the collision angle, and it is quite unclear whether or not the above assumption is applicable for this
region. However, in any case the line width of each component is typically 20 – 30 km s−1 , and the
Alfvén speed estimated by Fukui et al. (2006) is ∼24 km s−1 , so we can expect the relative velocity
in any direction to be more-or-less these values. For these reasons, we used 24 km s−1 for the relative
velocity, and accordingly we estimate the collision timescale for both CCC1 and CCC2 to be ∼105−6
years.
This collision timescale is enough shorter than the several-million-year formation timescale
of the loops (Fukui et al. 2006) for this CCC scenario to be consistent with the magnetic loop model.
Although the collision timescale is long enough for the collision to form high-mass star(s) in the
compressed layer, Torii et al. (2010a) reported that there is no star-forming activity in the foot point
MC.

4.2 CCC Scenario

The plausible displacement vectors indicate that main component 1 collided with sub-component
1 from Galactic southeast to the northwest (CCC1), while main component 2 collided with subcomponent 2 from Galactic north to the south (CCC2). Figure 8a shows a large-scale schematic
image toward molecular loops 1, 2, and the foot point MC. Figures 8b and c are close-up schematic
images toward the two CCCs.
Fukui et al. (2006) first discovered the molecular loops and determined the velocity of the foot
point to be ∼-130 to ∼-50 km s−1 in

12 CO(J=1–0).

Figure 7 of Torii et al. (2010b) [the velocity-

channel distribution of 12 CO(J=1–0)] also shows that loops 1, 2, and the foot point MC are only seen

in this above velocity range (the main component). From

12 CO(J=3–2)

observations with higher

angular resolution, Torii et al. (2010a) discovered another velocity feature, the sub-component, that is
interacting with the main component. According to these observations, they suggested that the main
component consists mainly of loops 1 and 2 and that the sub-component consists of molecular clouds
in the Galactic disk, i.e, that the molecular clouds were originally located at the foot point of loops 1
and 2 and did not float upward due to magnetic buoyancy. This indicates that the CCCs discovered in
the present work are collisions between loop clouds and disk clouds.
On the other hand, Torii et al. (2010b) and Kudo et al. (2011) proposed a simple dynamical
model for the main component and the sub-component as loop 1 and loop 2, respectively. This model
indicates that the CCCs are caused by contacts between loop 1 and loop 2. Although a detailed
kinematic model of the foot point and the interpretation of the U shape are still under debate,
we can interpret our CCC scenario through either of the two kinematic models. For a loopdisk collision, the loop clouds —in other words, the main components— might be falling down from
Galactic north to the south to collide with the disk clouds. However, the CCC1 is inconsistent with
this model. Matsumoto et al. (1988) indicates that numerical simulations found shock waves near
the foot points of the magnetic loops where the supersonically infalling gas hits the dense disk gas.
For a loop-loop collision, both loop clouds may be falling down with some relative velocity. In
14

this case, both north-to-south and south-to-north collisions are acceptable. Accordingly, a loop-loop
collision appears to be consistent with the kinematic model, even though a loop-disk collision is not
completely ruled out. The high intensity ratio between

12 CO(J=3–2)

and

12 CO(J=1–0)

and the

diffuse SiO emission throughout the foot point MC probably imply that both the loop-disk and looploop collisions took place elsewhere. Further detailed study of the kinematics in the foot point based
on MHD simulations is required.

4.3 The Origin of the Velocity Features in the foot point MC

Haworth et al. (2015) produced synthetic CO observations from numerical hydrodynamical simulations of a CCC obtained by Takahira et al. (2014). Figure 7 of Haworth et al. (2015) clearly shows
that the initial relative velocity between the two clouds is reduced during the collision via momentum
exchange. This figure also shows that the large cloud (or hole cloud) maintains its initial velocity,
whereas the velocity of the small cloud (or clump cloud) shifts to an intermediate velocity between
the initial velocities of the two clouds.
Assuming this mechanism to be universal, we here propose an origin for the U shapes and
broad emissions in the v − b diagram. A possible scenario is as follows: The collision started 105−6
years ago. At this stage, the main component had only the one velocity feature corresponding to the
velocity of the present main component 1, and the sub-component also had only the one velocity
feature corresponding to the velocity of the present sub-component 2. Next, momentum exchange
via CCCs created the intermediate velocity features —namely, the present main component 2 and
the present sub-component 1— at the interacting parts of the two components. Clump clouds in the
sub-component created the broad emissions observed in CCC1, and a clump cloud at the bottom of
the main component created the bottom parts of U shape 1 and U shape 2 observed in CCC2. This
proposed CCC-based interpretation of the v − b diagram is consistent with the previous kinematic
models of the molecular loops.
Torii et al. (2010a) explained the origin of high temperatures of ≥ 30 K at the broad emissions
by a C-type shock-heating model. Riquelme et al. (2010) revealed a high SiO to HCO+ ratio in the
foot point MC and Riquelme et al. (2018) concluded the enhancement of SiO caused by C-type shocks
with 30–50 km s−1 . Torii et al. (2010a) inferred that a magnetic-reconnection at the positions of the
broad emissions can possibly be responsible for the source of shock-heating, although they could not
explain why does it take place at the positions of the broad emissions instead of the bottom of the U
shape.
Figures 14 and 15 in the Appendix show that all colliding clump clouds emit SiO. Tsuboi et al.
15

(2015a) indicated that CCCs within ∼105 years is likely accompanied by SiO emissions originating
from C-type shocks. Therefore, Our CCC scenario proposes the shock-heating model as originating
from the CCC. This scenario naturally explains the origin of the high temperature and the enhancement of SiO in the foot point MC.

4.4 Comparison with other CCC regions

We finally discuss the properties of CCCs in the GC. By comparing CCCs in the Galactic disk region
to the GC, we found the following differences between them:
1. CCCs in the GC have a few to ten times larger relative velocity between the two colliding clouds,
and
2. CCCs in the GC are not necessarily associated with high-mass stars or clusters. (In contrast, CCCs
in the disk are always associated with high-mass stars or clusters)
These two points may be linked.
Takahira et al. (2014) have performed hydrodynamic simulations of CCCs between nonidentical clouds having Bonner–Ebert profiles. They discussed the importance of the relative velocity
of the clouds in forming a massive clump and triggering high-mass star formation. In their simulations, they found that a larger relative velocity can enhance the formation of cores, which grow into
a massive clump by coalescing with each other at the compressed layer. On the other hand, they also
found that a excessive relative velocity suppresses the growth of a massive clump by hampering mass
accretion due to the short accretion time available. They finally concluded that a relative velocity that
is fast enough to allow significant core formation but slow enough to give these cores time to accrete
is necessary for a CCC to trigger high-mass star formation.
To elucidate above hypothesis, we collected physical parameters of all CCC objects reported
so far, especially for their relative velocities, column densities, and the number of high mass stars.
Table 2 summarizes physical parameters of colliding clouds.
Figure 9 show scatter plots between the peak column density and relative velocity (9a), and
the peak column density and the number of OB stars (9b) of the CCCs in the Galactic sources reported to date. The difference in symbol color corresponds to the number of O- and early B-type stars
triggered by the CCC. The column of column density in Table 2 includes both peak column densities
and corrected peak column densities. We estimated the typical difference between a typical column
density and a peak column density to be factor of ∼3 from our CO data (Table 1). The corrected peak
column density was derived from multiplying the typical column density in reference(s) by 3. The
error bars were determined as ±20 % by assuming that the error is dominated by the intensity cali16

bration error. The measured relative velocities in literatures summarized in Table 2 is a line-of-sight
relative velocity and true three dimensional relative velocity must be larger than the measured value.
Wilson et al. (2011) observed galactic disk clouds in some nearby galaxies by JCMT and measured
a cloud-to-cloud-velocity-dispersion to be 6 km s−1 . Dobbs et al. (2015) performed hydrodynamic
simulations of a spiral galaxy and also confirmed that the dispersion is 4 – 6 km s−1 in their simulations. Therefore, we here put +6 km s−1 as the errors of the relative velocity in the plot. To estimate
the error of the number of O- and early B-type stars is difficult, however it should be less than factor
of 2. Then, we adopt 2 as the error.
The CCCs observed so far in the disk presumably achieve these conditions. The plot clearly
exhibits a linear trend between the two parameters on the logarithmic axes, and the top-right region
is dominated by CCCs with higher-mass clusters. This result implies that a collision with a higher
relative velocity requires a higher column density to trigger star formation. This is compatible with
the conclusion of Takahira et al. (2014). The foot point MC, which shows clear signatures of CCCs
but which is not associated with any high-mass star-formation activity, has a similar column density to
that seen in CCCs in the Galactic disk, in spite of its larger relative velocity. This may be the first case
in which the large relative velocity of the collision suppresses the formation of high-mass stars. In
contrast, Sgr B2 —represented as an open blue rectangle in the figure— is a famous star-burst region
17

in the Milky Way, hosting ∼50 ultra-compact HII regions (Gaume et al. 1995), and also it is known
to have originated as a CCC (Hasegawa et al. 1994). It is possible that this region has a large relative
velocity between the two clouds but that, due to its high column density, an extreme CCC occurred
and triggered the star burst.
The collision timescale in the GC is shorter than for a CCC in the disk. This is attributed
purely to the large relative velocity of the GC clouds. If the elapsed time exceeds ∼106 years, there
is no way to recognize it to be a CCC in the GC. However, thanks to this short elapsed time and
to little dispersal of the clouds by ionization due to UV radiation from high-mass stars, the (clumphole) shapes of pairs of colliding clouds are preserved. Another property of the CCCs in the GC is
enhanced SiO emission. Figures 14 and 15 in the Appendix show that all colliding clump clouds
emit SiO. Indeed, SiO emission accompanies all the possible CCCs in the CMZ observed so far
(Hasegawa et al. 1994; Tsuboi et al. 2015a; Tsuboi et al. 2015b). This emission may be evidence
for supersonic shock waves, which are generated at the beginning of a collision with a large relative
velocity. Therefore, all the recognizable CCCs in the GC are accompanied by SiO emission.
The magnetic activities in the GC are strong enough to affect the gas dynamics (Enokiya et
al. 2014). Although the detailed mechanism for the formation of a massive clump in such strong
magnetic field is still unclear, an extreme CCC might take place at stagnation points of molecular gas,
which may occur at the foot points of loops and/or at contact points between x1 and x2 orbits (Binney
et al. 1991).

5 Summary

For the first time, we have applied the CCC-identification methodology developed by studies of CCCs
in the Galactic disk to the GC. To examine the properties of the CCCs in the GC, as the first step we
applied this method to the common foot point of molecular loops 1 and 2, where the systematic
downflow may enhances the chance of CCCs occuring. We summarize the conclusions of the present
work as follows:
1. Two pairs of velocity components (main component 1–sub-component 1 and main component 2–
sub-component 2) show complementary distributions in space and V shapes in velocity. These are
evidence of CCCs.
2. The CCCs took place 105−6 years ago, either by contact between loops 1 and 2 and/or by loops
1 and 2 to impacting clouds in the Galactic disk. Our new model, based on CCCs, completely
explains the origin of the U shapes and the broad emissions in the foot point MC. This model is
consistent with the kinematic models proposed in previous works.
18

3. In contrarast to the Galactic disk, the CCCs in the foot point MC are not associated with any highmass-star-formation activity. We suggest that the large relative velocity suppresses the formation
of high-mass stars by the CCCs as proposed by Takahira et al. (2014).
