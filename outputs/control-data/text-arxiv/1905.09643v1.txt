Abstract
The lensless endoscope represents the ultimate limit in miniaturization
of imaging tools: an image can be transmitted through a (multi-mode
or multi-core) fiber by numerical or physical inversion of the fiber’s premeasured transmission matrix. However, the transmission matrix changes
completely with only minute conformational changes of the fiber, which
has so far limited lensless endoscopes to fibers that must be kept static.
In this letter we report for the first time a lensless endoscope which is
exempt from the requirement of static fiber by designing and employing a
custom-designed conformationally invariant fiber. We give experimental
and theoretical validations and determine the parameter space over which
the invariance is maintained.

Introduction

Cellular-level microscopic imaging has long been a vital tool in biomedical research. Recent years have seen numerous efforts to miniaturize imaging instruments to enable cellular-level imaging in behaving animals. A recent example
is the miniaturized head mounted microscope for fluorescence imaging [1] (2 g,
9×15×22 mm). This approach has light source, filters, imaging optics, and
CMOS camera integrated into a head mounted device. A different approach
bases the light delivery and collection on optical fiber which brings the advantage that light source and detectors can be remote rather than integrated in
the head mounted device. As an added benefit, optical fiber-based approaches
can use pulsed laser sources and perform non-linear imaging—to date demonstrations have been using piezo-electric actuators [2] (few grammes, Ø3 mm ×
1

40 mm) or micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) mirrors [3] (2.15 g, Ø10
× 40 mm) to perform point-scanning imaging. For an overview of the most
”conventional” optical fiber-based approaches, see Ref. [4].
A new approach to fiber-based endoscopes came about in 2011 [5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10] which does away with imaging optics between fiber and sample and
consequently is often termed ”lensless endoscopes”. This represents the ultimate
limit in miniaturization, since the head-mounted device can be as small as an
optical fiber itself. Cellular-level imaging in live mice by lensless endoscopes
has recently been demonstrated [11, 12], but imaging modality was restricted
to one-photon fluorescence imaging and fiber length to few cm, and the animal
subject was fixed.
The lensless endoscope is most commonly implemented with image acquisition by point-scanning [5, 11, 12, 7, 9], although other strategies exist [8, 13, 14].
The generic concept of the lensless endoscope is: (i) The transmission matrix
(TM) in the basis of localized modes [15] of the fiber is measured in a preliminary step; (ii) The columns of the TM are identified as the input fields that give
rise to focused output fields; (iii) The phase masks that convert the laser beam
into said input fields are calculated; (iv) Said phase masks are displayed sequentially on a spatial light modulator (SLM), resulting in a two-dimensional scan
of the output focus, all the while back-scattered fluorescence signal is recorded,
as in a point-scanning microscope. The fiber can be either a multi-mode fiber
(MMF) [11, 12, 8, 13, 16] or a multi-core fiber (MCF) [9, 10, 14]. In either case,
its transmission matrix H can be thought of as
H = X̂H0

(1)

where H0 is the pre-measured TM, measured in a reference conformation, and
X̂ is the ”extrinsic contribution” to the TM when the fiber conformation departs
from the reference conformation, in general it is represented as an operator [16].
In both the MMF and MCF case, the great challenge remains that following each
conformational change of the fiber either the additional extrinsic contribution
(X̂) or the new TM (H) must be experimentally quantified whether directly
[17, 18] or indirectly [16] in order for aberation-free imaging to continue. This is
the main obstacle standing between us and a flexible lensless endoscope which
would open the possibility for minimally-invasive imaging in behaving animals.

Results
Twisted multi-core fiber (MCF)

In our earlier work we have shown how lensless endoscopes based on MCF (as
opposed to MMF) simplify many of the considerations pertaining to the TM
[19]. In particular, in Ref. [20], we showed that the extrinsic contribution X̂ to
the TM of a MCF is simply a diagonal matrix with complex elements of unit
norm and argument which is linear in the transverse coordinate, i.e. a matrix
with only two free parameters. In the present article, we take an entirely new
2

approach to overcoming this challenge: We seek to design a MCF for which the
extrinsic contribution is identity (X̂ = I) which would render real-time tracking
of the TM unnecessary and finally allow lensless endoscopes to reach their full
potential as the endoscope fiber could be allowed to flex freely. As we show
below a MCF with a twisted geometry can fulfill this requirement.
We designed and fabricated [see the Supplemental Information and Fig. 1(a)]
two MCFs, ”MCF1” and ”MCF2” which have the following parameters in common: Number of cores N = 489; core-to-core distance (pitch) Λ = 16µm;
parabolic core index profile with index difference relative to the cladding ∆n = 30·10−3 ;
core diameter D = 3.5 µm (single mode). MCF1 is twisted with a helical period
of P1 = 33 mm, MCF2 with P2 = 8.2 mm. See Fig. 1(b) for a schematic of the
twisted MCFs as well as the coordinates that we will employ. A non-twisted
MCF, ”MCF0” with the same parameters but P0 = ∞ was drawn as well to
serve as a reference.

2.2

Twisted MCF: Intrinsic properties

The theoretical properties of the twisted MCF are derived in the Supplemental
Information, a summary is given in the following. Considering first a straight
section of twisted MCF of length L. The center core is unaltered by the twist,
the effective index of the fundamental mode in the center core at wavelength
(0)
λ = 1 µm is neff = 1.4626. Generally, the core i, radially offset from the center
(i)
by d , has its physical length modified by the twist as
q
L
(i)
(2πd(i) )2 + P 2 .
(2)
L =
P
As a consequence, the twisted MCF exhibits a radially-dependent native phase
delay ∆φ(i) as an intrinsic property:
∆φ(i) = φ(i) − φ(0) =

2π (0) (i)
n (L − L).

By the same token, the twisted MCF also exhibits a radially-dependent native
group delay ∆τ (i) as an intrinsic property

In the strict sense, Eq. 4 is approximate, but in the Supplemental Information we
demonstrate that group index and refractive index can be used interchangeably
without invalidating our conclusions. Figure 2(a) shows the comparison between
the native group delays measured in MCF1 and MCF2 by spectral interference
[21] as a function of radial core offset d(i) and those calculated by Eq. 4. We
observe excellent agreement. Figure 2(b) shows experimentally measured mode
field diameters compared to those found by numerical simulation. Both show
that the twist induces no appreciable variation in the mode field diameter. The
phase profile of the off-center modes, however, is altered as a consequence of

geometrical consideration predicts that the beam exiting core i has an azimuthal
component, the angle of the free space beam with the MCF axis being [See Inset

In Fig. 2(d) we compare the experimentally measured θ(i) , measured as the
optimal coupling angle of the free space beam entering core number i, to those
predicted by Eq. 5, and we observe excellent agreement. Since the off-center
cores follow a curved path in space, they are expected to experience loss when P
is small. Our numerical simulations showed that no curved path loss (< 1 dB/m)
due to this effect is expected for neither MCF1 nor MCF2. Curved path loss
is expected only for twist period P < 2 mm as detailed in the Supplemental
Information. Nevertheless, as seen in Fig. 2(c) MCF2 does present a radiallydependent loss, but a cut-back measurement from 900 mm to 345 mm revealed
that their origin was not the fiber itself, so we are able to attribute them to
coupling loss due to mode mismatch between the input gaussian beam profiles
and the MCF modes with non-flat transverse phase cf Eq. 5.

2.3

Twisted MCF: Extrinsic contribution

We consider now a bent section of the twisted MCF with length L and bend
radius of curvature R cf Fig. 1. Now, in addition to the native phase and group
delays, extrinsic contributions to the phase delay ∆[∆φ(i) ] and group delay
∆[∆τ (i) ] appear. As we demonstrate in the Supplemental Information, when L
= k · P , k ∈ N , L(i) is independent of R, and as a consequence ∆[∆φ(i) ] = 0
and ∆[∆τ (i) ] = 0. That is, when the fiber length equals an integer number
of twist periods the extrinsic contribution is the identity matrix, and so the
MCF is conformationally invariant for all fiber shapes with constant radius of
curvature. An intuitive explanation for this is to realize that when the condition
is satisfied a given core spends as much time on the exterior of the bent MCF
as it does on the interior, so the longitudinal compression of the core on the
interior compensated the longitudinal dilation on the exterior.
To demonstrate the conformational invariance, we cut MCF2 to length L2 =
345 mm ≈ 42P2 and MCF0 to L0 = 344 mm and performed a series of imaging
experiments.

2.4

Conformationally invariant endoscope

As a first demonstration we show how a focus at the distal end of the MCF is
maintained independently of MCF bends. To do so, we use the experimental
setup detailed in the Supplemental Information to establish a focus at the output
end of MCF2. In Fig. 3(a) we show an image of the focus established for MCF2
held straight (R = ∞). Subsequently, and without changing the injection, we
then displaced the distal end to change the radius of curvature of the MCF

L2 = 0.345 m and R = ∞; (b) with R ≥ 0.06 m; see Visualization 1 for the

to R = 0.06 m. The focus, as seen in Fig. 3(b), retains its position to within
one spot size. As a base of comparison, Figs. 3(c), 3(d) show that the PSF of
MCF0 is translated by a much larger amount for a miniscule conformational
change (to R = 0.6 m). A side-by-side comparison is given by Visualization
1 (MCF2) and Visualization 2 (MCF0) which show how the PSF translated
when the MCFs undergo the same conformational change. This showcases the
dramatic reduction in extrinsic contribution in MCF2 to the level where MCF2
can be considered virtually conformationally invariant.

In Fig. 4 we show digital confocal images of a USAF target acquired through
MCF2 in (Fig. 4(a)) straight geometry (R = ∞); and (Fig. 4(b)) bent geometry
(R = 0.06 m). A slight translation of the image can be observed which is
reminiscent of the translation of the PSF from Fig. 3(a) to Fig. 3(b), and thus

Discussion

We note that the images presented here [Figs. 4(a),4(b)] are with one-photon
contrast. The reason for this is the large native group delay that results from
the twist [Fig. 2(a)]. This native group delay is static and could be compensated
with a static pre-compensation so, while not demonstrated here, there are no
conceptual difficulties in rendering the setup compatible with ultra-short laser
excitation, and to access nonlinear imaging modalities.
We note also that the imaging results presented here were done with forwardcollection of signals, rather than with epi-collection through the MCF. The
reason for this is the low fill factor of the cores, which results in poor epicollection efficiency. However, it can be envisioned to increase the epi-collection
efficiency of the twisted MCF by adding an external low-index cladding, like in
e.g. Ref. [10].
In the above we have shown that the lensless endoscope based on twisted
MCF with an integer number of twist periods is conformationally invariant as
long as the bend radius of curvature remains constant. In practice there are two
main ways that conditions can depart from this ideal condition: (i) Mismatch
between length and twist period i.e. L 6= k · P, k ∈ N ; and (ii) non-constant
bend radius of curvature i.e. R varies along the MCF. Concerning (i) we present
in the Supplemental Information a map of the extrinsic contribution to phase
delay ∆[∆φ(i) ] in the relevant parameters, permitting to identify the parametric sub-space where departure from conformational invariance does not exceed a
certain threshold. Concerning (ii) it is not possible to offer insights from analytical considerations, instead an integral must be numerically evaluated, and in the
Supplemental Information we calculate ∆[∆φ(i) ] for realistic MCF shapes. We
concede that conformational invariance naturally cannot be maintained over the
entire parameter space, nevertheless we maintain that the twisted MCF drastically reduces the extrinsic contribution over the majority of fiber conformations
likely to be found in practical settings.
Finally we remark that the shorter the twist period of a MCF, the more
conformationally invariant it will be. In the limiting case of infinitesimal twist
period, the MCF is conformationally invariant over the entire parameter space.
In practice, this limit is unattainable because losses due to the curved path of
the cores will set in at a certain twist period. In the Supplemental Information
we detail numerical calculations which show that, for the MCF parameters used
here, twist periods below 2 mm lead to losses above 1 dB/m.
We have demonstrated a lensless endoscope based on a novel, twisted MCF
at an operating point where imaging performance is unaffected by the conformation of the fiber. Our findings relax the constraints on fiber shape in lensless
endoscopes and pave the way towards imaging tools that reap simultaneously
the two principal benefits of using nothing but an optical fiber as imaging probe,
namely, its small diameter and its flexibility.

Methods
Fabrication of twisted MCF

The MCF was made using the stack and draw method. More precisely, a stack
of 487 capillaries drawn from a commercial pure silica tube (Heraeus F300) were
first assembled inside a silica tube of ∼50 mm outside diameter. Then 487 rods
drawn from a commercial graded-index preform (∆n = 30 · 10−3 , Prysmian)
were inserted into each of these capillaries. This sleeving approach was used
in order to guarantee no coupling between adjacent cores of the final fiber by
increasing sufficiently the distance between these cores. This stack was drawn
into canes of about 5 mm. During this draw, a vacuum was applied between
the capillaries and inside them in order to get solid canes free of bubbles that
could appear at the different silica interfaces present in the stack. Finally one of
these canes was drawn into a fiber of ∼450 µm diameter at low drawing speed
(2 m/min), the twist being obtained by rotating the cane at the top of the fiber
drawing tower (60 rpm for MCF1 and 250 rpm at MCF2).

4.2

Experimental methods

The experimental setup (Fig. 5, Supplemental Information) was designed to
measure the MCF properties using two modalities: ultrashort (fs) pulses or continuous wave (CW) in order to perform group delay and imaging measurements,
respectively. The first modality was used to perform the phase-stepping spectral
interferometry to measure group delays of laser pulses transmitted through different MCF cores (with respect to a reference core, usually the central core), as
described in [21]. The second modality is used to measure the PSF and imaging
performance during MCF conformational changes.
For phase-stepping spectral interferometry (Fig. 5, Supplemental Information) the laser beam (Amplitude Systèmes t-Pulse, central wavelength 1030
nm, pulse length 170 fs, repetition rate 50 MHz) is expanded with a telescope
(lenses L1 and L2) to overfill the clear aperture of a spatial light modulator
(SLM, Hamamatsu LCoS-SLM X10468-07). The SLM is used to segment and
shape the wavefront into beamlets prior to their injection into the cores of the
MCF proximal facet. For group delay measurements only two cores are injected
into (the central, reference, core and the core i) resulting in fringes at the MCF
output far field. For PSF measurements all cores are injected into in order
to produce a focus at the MCF output. The necessary demagnification of the
beamlets to fit the core diameters is achieved via a lens L3 and a microscope
objective MO1 (Olympus Plan N, 20x NA 0.40). Light, transmitted through
the cores, is collected at the fiber distal end using a second microscope objective MO2 (Nikon Plan, 10x NA 0.25) and passes through a linear polarizer LP
(Thorlabs LPNIR100) to maximize the contrast of the interference fringes [22].
The image of the distal MCF facet or its near field is monitored with CCD1
(FLIR FL3-U3-32S2M-CS) in order to follow any changes of the transmitted
power or the generated interference pattern while the fiber is bent. The MCF

10

output far field is coupled into a multimode fiber (core diameter of 62.5 µm,
not shown in Fig. 5, Supplemental Information), linked to an optical spectrum
analyzer OSA (Yokogawa AQ-6315A), or imaged entirely onto a camera CCD2
(Thorlabs DCU223M) to record the point spread function (PSF) stability in
during MCF bending. Magnification of the objective MO2 and lenses L4, L5 is
chosen so that only restricted area of the far field pattern is selected with the
MMF probe (fulfilling therefore kx D > 2, where kx is related to the interference
fringe spatial frequency and D is diameter of the MMF core collecting the light).
The distal end of the MCF is kept fixed on a portable unit that can freely rotate
whilst the MCF is bent. The fiber conformation is monitored using a portable
camera (not shown). Finally galvanometric scan mirrors conjugated to the SLM
active area (telescope L1 and L2) are used to scan the focused distal PSF across
the sample for imaging. The galvanometric mirrors impose controllable phase
tilts on the input wavefront that are translated to the output distal MCF facet
owing to the diagonal MCF transmission matrix.

continuous wave; fs, femtosecond; galvo, galvanometric mirror; L, lens; SLM,
spatial light modulator; MO, microscope objective; MCF, multicore fiber; LP,
linear polarizer; BS, beam splitter; CCD, charge coupled device; OSA, optical
spectrum analyzer. The MCF (in gray) is clamped at both ends along approximately 2 cm long sections (dark gray).
The experimental setup (Fig. 5) was designed to measure the MCF properties using two modalities: ultrashort (fs) pulses or continuous wave (CW)
in order to perform group delay and imaging measurements, respectively. The
first modality was used to perform the phase-stepping spectral interferometry to
measure group delays of laser pulses transmitted through different MCF cores
(with respect to a reference core, usually the central core), as described in [21].
The second modality is used to measure the PSF and imaging performance
during MCF conformational changes.
For phase-stepping spectral interferometry (Fig. 5) the laser beam (Amplitude Systèmes t-Pulse, central wavelength 1030 nm, pulse length 170 fs, repetition rate 50 MHz) is expanded with a telescope (lenses L1 and L2) to overfill
the clear aperture of a spatial light modulator (SLM, Hamamatsu LCoS-SLM
X10468-07). The SLM is used to segment and shape the wavefront into beamlets prior to their injection into the cores of the MCF proximal facet. For group
delay measurements only two cores are injected into (the central, reference, core
15

and the core i) resulting in fringes at the MCF output far field. For PSF measurements all cores are injected into in order to produce a focus at the MCF
output. The necessary demagnification of the beamlets to fit the core diameters
is achieved via a lens L3 and a microscope objective MO1 (Olympus Plan N,
20x NA 0.40). Light, transmitted through the cores, is collected at the fiber
distal end using a second microscope objective MO2 (Nikon Plan, 10x NA 0.25)
and passes through a linear polarizer LP (Thorlabs LPNIR100) to maximize
the contrast of the interference fringes [22]. The image of the distal MCF facet
or its near field is monitored with CCD1 (FLIR FL3-U3-32S2M-CS) in order
to follow any changes of the transmitted power or the generated interference
pattern while the fiber is bent. The MCF output far field is coupled into a
multimode fiber (core diameter of 62.5 µm, not shown in Fig. 5), linked to
an optical spectrum analyzer OSA (Yokogawa AQ-6315A), or imaged entirely
onto a camera CCD2 (Thorlabs DCU223M) to record the point spread function
(PSF) stability in during MCF bending. Magnification of the objective MO2
and lenses L4, L5 is chosen so that only restricted area of the far field pattern is
selected with the MMF probe (fulfilling therefore kx D > 2, where kx is related
to the interference fringe spatial frequency and D is diameter of the MMF core
collecting the light). The distal end of the MCF is kept fixed on a portable unit
that can freely rotate whilst the MCF is bent. The fiber conformation is monitored using a portable camera (not shown). Finally galvanometric scan mirrors
conjugated to the SLM active area (telescope L1 and L2) are used to scan the
focused distal PSF across the sample for imaging. The galvanometric mirrors
impose controllable phase tilts on the input wavefront that are translated to the
output distal MCF facet owing to the diagonal MCF transmission matrix.

Bending-induced inter-core group delays for
twisted and non-twisted fiber

Figure 6 provides additional experimental data for the native and extrinsic contribution to group delay in the cores, presented as a function of the transverse core coordinates. In the case of the non-twisted fiber MCF0 held straight
[Fig. 6(a)] we observe a random distribution of group delays with standard deviation [XXX - VT please specify the standard deviation] that is related to intrinsic
imperfections [20, 21]. For a relatively small angle (∆α = 25◦ ) [Fig. 6(c)] we
observe a linear dependence of the bending-induced group delays on the core
position with respect to the bending axis, as detailed in [20]. If MCF0 were
employed with ultrashort pulses, increasing ∆α will result in a PSF degradation associated with a non perfect temporal overlap of the pulses arriving at the
focal plane of a lensless endoscope.
The twisted MCF2, on the other hand, exhibits important native group
delays when held straight [Fig. 6(d)] due to the increased physical lengths of
the peripheral cores (Eq. 4). Extrinsic contribution do to conformational change
is, however, negligible in this fiber [Fig. 6(e)] and did not exceed ±20 fs for a

phase-stepping spectral inferferometry technique. Indeed Figs. 3(a),3(b) (main
text) showed that the extrinsic contribution to phase delay is less than 2π, this
strongly suggests that extrinsic contribution to group delay remains less than
an optical cycle or 3.3 fs.

Fabrication of twisted MCF

The MCF was made using the stack and draw method. More precisely, a stack
of 487 capillaries drawn from a commercial pure silica tube (Heraeus F300) were
first assembled inside a silica tube of ∼50 mm outside diameter. Then 487 rods
drawn from a commercial graded-index preform (∆n = 30 · 10−3 , Prysmian)
were inserted into each of these capillaries. This sleeving approach was used
in order to guarantee no coupling between adjacent cores of the final fiber by
increasing sufficiently the distance between these cores. This stack was drawn
into canes of about 5 mm. During this draw, a vacuum was applied between
the capillaries and inside them in order to get solid canes free of bubbles that
could appear at the different silica interfaces present in the stack. Finally one of
these canes was drawn into a fiber of ∼450 µm diameter at low drawing speed
(2 m/min), the twist being obtained by rotating the cane at the top of the fiber
drawing tower (60 rpm for MCF1 and 250 rpm at MCF2).

8

Analytical model of twisted MCF

The analytical model is equivalent to the first order of perturbation for which
the field distribution is not affected by the twist. Since the refractive index
contrast of the fiber is very low, we can consider that the effective index is equal
to the group index : with the parameters given in part 2.1A, nef f = 1.4626 and
ng = 1.4909 for the central core at 1 µm wavelength.

We note that we can take neff = neff because the twist of the MCF is introduced
during the fiber drawing process, so no additional stress accompanies the twist.
This is different from the case where twist is introduced by mechanical twisting
of the MCF in which case the photoelastic effect must be taken into account.
The group delay experienced by a pulse of light travelling in core i is then

Bent MCF

In the general case R 6= ∞, L(i) we must take into account the photoelastic
effect of silica. Indeed, the refractive index of the core i is modified as:

nbent = ncore 1 − pe
(17)

19

where pe ' 0.22 for fused silica is a coefficient depending on Poisson’s ratio and
components of the photoelastic tensor [23].
If the radius of the curvature is much smaller than the fiber diameter, we can
use the first order theory of perturbation and assume that the electric field E
is not affected by the bending and remains confined in the core. In the scalar
approximation [24]:

From which it can be seen that when L = k · P , k ∈ N , OPL(i) does not change
with R. This is the basis of the conformationally invariant lensless endoscope as
demonstrated in the main text. In practice, however, it is not possible to attain
this condition with arbitrary precision. In order to remain within the regime of
conformational invariance, the following criterion on the error phase δφ(i)

to arbitrary precision as a function of all involved parameters (P , ξ (i) , L(i) , R,
d(i) ). Here, we evaluate δφ(i) for an excursion δL in a range around the optimal
value of L and bend radius of curvature R, mapped in Fig. 7 for the extreme
core with d(i) = 12·16 = 192 µm which experiences the largest error phase of
all the cores.

Non-constant bend radius of curvature

All the results obtained with a constant radius can be easily extended by replacing the constant radius R with the radius of curvature of the curve described
by the fiber. No general results can be extracted from the analytical formulae

21

and, as an example, we will study the case of a fiber maintained fixed at one
extremity and whose other end is subjected to a normal force. It is well-known
that, in this case, the curve of the fiber is described by a cubic function y = ax3
(a depends on the force, the Young modulus and the second moment of area of
the cross section of the fiber). Some different bending configuration are depicted
in Fig 8 for different value of a and a constant fiber length of 0.8 m.

Figure 8: Different shapes of the fiber when applying a normal force on one
extremity.
The variation of phase ∆φ(i) (defined in Eq. 3) between the core i and the
central core was numerically computed and plotted if d(i) = 160 µm for a nontwisted fiber (Fig 9a) and for a twisted fiber with a helical period of 8 mm (Fig
9b). For the non-twisted MCF, we have already demonstrated that [20]:
|∆φ(i) |
d(i) | cos(ξ (i) )|

(25)

where ∆α is the angular increase along the curve formed by the fiber.
This gives a phase difference of approximately 360π between the core i and the
central core if a = 1 m−2 and ξ (i) = 0 while the maximum phase difference
in the case of the twisted MCF is only 0.47π. This clearly demonstrates the
bending resilience of the twisted MCF.

FEM model of twisted MCF

To determine the properties of the modes with the finite elements method
(FEM), we used method describe by Nicolet et al. [25]. This method uses

the transformation optics formalism to obtain an equivalent translation invariant problem for which the permittivity and the permeability are anisotropic.
The effective indices calculated with this method must be modified according to
the mode azimutal number to obtain the real effective indices [26]. Note than
this method is not applicable to a bent twisted fiber since the problem can not
be reduced to a translation invariant problem in this case. However, this allows
to determine mode losses due to the twist which are neglected in the analytical
model. Note that the effective index and the group index calculated by this
method are defined as:

In Fig. 10a, values of effective index and group index obtained with Eq. 9
(blue and red lines) are compared with those obtained with the FEM method
(blue and red crosses). Losses of the fundamental mode computed with the FEM
method are plotted in orange (right axis). We can verify that the approximations
used to obtained Eq. 9 are valid with the parameters used in this article even
when losses are very high (> 1dB/m). Note that losses are are lower than 1
dB/km when the twist period equals 8 mm.
The evolution of the phase of the electric field with the distance is plotted in
