ABSTRACT
The Mission Accessible Near-Earth Object Survey (MANOS) aims to observe and characterize small
(mean absolute magnitude H ∼ 25 mag) Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) that are accessible by spacecraft (mean ∆v ∼ 5.7 km/s) and that make close approaches with the Earth (mean Minimum Orbital
Intersection Distance MOID ∼ 0.03 AU). We present here the first results of the MANOS visible spectroscopic survey. The spectra were obtained from August 2013 to March 2018 at Lowell Observatory’s
Discovery Channel 4.3 meter telescope, and both Gemini North and South facilities. In total, 210
NEOs have been observed and taxonomically classified. Our taxonomic distribution shows significant
variations with respect to surveys of larger objects. We suspect these to be due to a dependence of
Main Belt source regions on object size. Compared to previous surveys of larger objects (Binzel et al.
2019, 2004; Perna et al. 2018), we report a lower fraction of S+Q-complex asteroids of 43.8 ± 4.6%.
We associate this decrease with a lack of Phocaea family members at very small size. We also report
higher fractions of X-complex and A-type asteroids of 23.8 ± 3.3% and 3.8 ± 1.3% respectively due to
an increase of Hungaria family objects at small size. We find a strong correlation between the Q/S
ratio and perihelion distance. We suggest this correlation is due to planetary close encounters with
Venus playing a major role in turning asteroids from S to Q-type. This hypothesis is supported by a
similar correlation between the Q/S ratio and Venus MOID.

1. INTRODUCTION

Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) are defined by a perihelion distance q < 1.3 AU. The study of NEOs provides access to objects up to 3 orders of magnitude
smaller than the smallest observable Main Belt asteroids (MBAs), where most NEOs are thought to have
originated. NEOs are also the most accessible objects
to spacecraft in the Solar System, enabling detailed
study of their physical properties. Since the discovery
of (433) Eros in 1898, the number of known NEOs has

continuously grown and now reaches over 20,000 objects
as of April 2019.
To date, a representative census of NEO physical
properties exists only for the largest objects (equivalent
diameter D > 1 km). They have been studied using
various techniques such as time-series photometry (e.g.
Krugly et al. 2002; Chang et al. 2015), spectrophotometry (e.g. Mommert et al. 2016; Erasmus et al. 2017;
Navarro-Meza et al. 2019), spectroscopy (e.g Binzel et al.
2004, 2019), radar techniques (e.g. Ostro et al. 2006),
and polarimetry (e.g. De Luise et al. 2007; Devogèle
et al. 2018; Cellino et al. 2018). However, an equivalent census for sub-km NEOs, which represent more
than 95% of the currently known population, does not
exist. The goal of this work and the Mission Accessible

2

Devogèle et al.

Near-Earth Object Survey (MANOS) is to address this
issue.
MANOS is an observational survey of small (mean
H ∼ 25 mag), mission accessible (mean ∆v ∼ 5.7
km/s) NEOs which experience close approaches to Earth
(mean Earth Minimum Orbit Intersection Distance or
MOID ∼ 0.03 AU). ∆v in this context is defined as the
impulse needed for a spacecraft to maneuver from low
Earth orbit to a rendezvous with the asteroid in its orbit. It can be computed for NEOs using the approximation described by Shoemaker & Helin (1978). MANOS
provides comprehensive characterization of these objects by performing astrometic, photometric (Thirouin
et al. 2016, 2018), and spectroscopic (this work) observations. The first observations started in late 2013 and the
project is currently funded by the NASA Solar System
Observations program through mid-2020.
The study of small NEOs is of importance for several reasons. It is currently estimated that there are
∼ 107 objects with D > 10 m, whereas ∼ 104 have
D > 100 m (Harris & DAbramo 2015; Trilling et al.
2017). The increasing numbers at small sizes implies
higher probability of a small NEO impacting the Earth
on relatively short (<decadal) timescales. To date, only
three asteroids (2008 TC3, 2014 AA, and 2018 LA)
have been telescopically observed prior to impact and
all are smaller than 10 meters (Jenniskens et al. 2009;
Farnocchia et al. 2016, 2018). Studying objects like
these and understanding their physical properties will
allow development of efficient mitigation strategies in
the case of future life threatening impacts. In addition,
observing small asteroids over long periods of time can
allow for the characterization of size-dependent evolutionary processes. Specifically, the Yarkovsky and
Yarkovsky-O’Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effects (Bottke Jr et al. 2006) can provide important information about asteroid spin, thermal, and/or interior
properties (Hanuš et al. 2018). Lastly, small asteroids
may have different physical properties than larger ones.
Models for size sorting of surface particles via seismic
shaking suggest that small bodies can have different
surface particle size distributions than larger bodies
(Maurel et al. 2016). Efficiency of different regolith formation processes might be size dependent (Delbó et al.
2014), and whether or not small objects are even covered by regolith is still debated. In general, asteroids
larger than about 200 meters are not found to rotate
faster than 2.2 hours (Holsapple 2007), though there
are rare exceptions (De Luise et al. 2007; Chang et al.
2016; Polishook et al. 2016). Smaller asteroids however
can rotate much faster, with some a rapid as 20 seconds per cycle (Thirouin et al. 2018). These differences

in spin properties indicate that the internal structure
of large and small objects could be different. While
larger objects are usually considered to be rubble-piles,
smaller ones could either be monolithic or possess sufficient internal strength to prevent them from breaking
apart due to the centrifugal acceleration imparted by
rapid rotation (Hérique et al. 2018; Rozitis et al. 2014;
Polishook et al. 2017b).
In this work, we present visible spectra for 210 small
NEOs (mean size around D = 60m) observed in the
framework of MANOS. The spectra of small NEOs allows us to derive their taxonomic classifications (Bus
& Binzel 2002; DeMeo et al. 2009). NEOs primarily
originate from the Main Asteroid Belt (Granvik et al.
2018), thus by understanding NEOs we probe the population of small MBAs which are currently inaccessible with current observational techniques. Comparing
physical properties across size regimes both within and
across populations may provide insight into size dependent evolutionary processes.
In the next section of this paper we present the observations of our 210 NEOs, the three facilities used for
these observations, and our reduction procedure. Section 3 introduces asteroid taxonomy and describes the
procedures used in this work. In Section 4 we describe
the properties of our sample in terms of absolute H magnitude and equivalent estimated diameter, and discuss
their taxonomic distribution. Section 5 is devoted to
the discussion of the different biases that might affect
our sample. Section 6 is devoted to the discussion of
the results obtained by merging our sample with two
other visible spectroscopic surveys of NEOs (Binzel et al.
2019; Perna et al. 2018). This allows us to analyze the
largest available visible spectroscopic database covering
asteroids from kilometer down to meter scales. We will
discuss the properties of this sample in terms of the taxonomic distribution as a function of orbital parameters,
MOID (Minimum Orbit Intersection Distance), and size.

2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION

The observations presented here were conducted over
5 years from August 2013 to March 2018 using both
8.1 m Gemini North (Mauna Kea, Hawaii, USA; MPC
code: 568) and South (Cerro Pachón, Chile; MPC
code: I11) (Mountain et al. 1994), and Lowell Observatory’s 4.3 m Discovery Channel Telescope (DCT;
Happy Jack, Arizona, USA; MPC code: G37) (Sebring
et al. 2004). The GMOS-N and GMOS-S (Gemini Multi
Object Spectrometer) instruments (Davies et al. 1997)
were used at the Gemini observatories and the DeVeny
spectrograph (Bida et al. 2014) was used at the DCT.

MANOS spectroscopic results
All observations were reduced using the same pythonbased spectral reduction pipeline optimized for asteroid
spectral reduction. The pipeline was developed for this
project and will be the focus of a future publication and
public release. In the first step of the pipeline, each
image is bias and flat field corrected. Biases are constructed by taking the median of a series of 5 to 11
zero-second exposures. The flat fields were acquired by
uniformly illuminating a screen in the dome. A master flat field is constructed by first removing the spectral response of the lamp by normalizing each column
(spatial direction) to the median. To avoid differential
spatial variation with wavelength, the median is computed only around the region were the target spectra
are located on the science images. Next, a cosmic ray
filter is applied. We use the cosmic.py python based
cosmic detection and removal procedure1 . This code is
based on the Laplacian cosmic ray detection algorithm
by Van Dokkum (2001). For both GMOS instruments
a spatial nodding procedure is employed during the observations. This technique involves taking spectral exposures with the target nodded to different spatial locations along the slit, and then subtracting pairs of exposures from one other to remove a majority of the sky
background. However, due to changing sky conditions
from one exposure to the next, some telluric emission
lines remain after pair subtraction. A secondary step
of background subtraction is then applied by fitting the
residual background on either side of the target to interpolate the value at the location of the spectrum. In
the case of the DeVeny spectra, no spatial nodding was
used and only the second sky background subtraction
method was applied. Each spectrum is then extracted,
wavelength calibrated, and combined. The final step
consists of dividing the NEO spectrum by the spectrum
of a solar analog. The solar analog is observed immediately before or after the NEO and is chosen to match as
closely as possible the NEO airmass. During the division step, the spectrum of the solar analogue is gradually
shifted (shift of the order of 10−5 µm) with respect to
the spectrum of the asteroid in order to find the combination which provides the best correction of the telluric
lines. Finally the spectrum is binned to a resolution of
∼ 200 (0.003 µm bins). The pipeline also determines a
spectral taxonomic classification by comparing the final
asteroid spectrum with Bus-Demeo templates for each
taxonomic class using a chi-square analysis. However,
for consistency with previous surveys, the reported taxonomic classification was determine using the M4AST
1

py 0.4/doc/index.html

taxonomic classification webservice (§3 for more details).
Table 5 summarizes all the observations presented in this
work.
2.1. GMOS@Gemini
We obtained 178 spectra of NEOs using the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrographs (GMOS) in the long-slit
mode at both 8.1 m Gemini North (134 objects) and
South (44 objects) telescopes. These instruments provide spectral observations from 0.36 to 0.94 µm.
In 2017, GMOS-North had a detector upgrade which
provided better sensitivity in both the red and blue
end of the spectral coverage. The old detector consisted of three 2048x4608 chips arranged in a row. Each
of these detectors was an e2v deep depletion device
with enhanced blue and red sensitivity. These detectors provided a plate scale of 0.0728 arcsec per pixels in the spatial direction and a dispersion of 0.174
nm per pixel for the R150 grating and 0.067 nm per
pixel for the R400 grating. The upgraded array uses
three 2048x4176 Hamamatsu detectors which are each
optimized for throughput at their respective wavelength
regimes. The new plate scale is 0.0807 arcsec per pixel
in the spatial direction with a dipsersion of 0.193 nm
per pixel for the R150 and 0.074 for the R400 grating.
The new Hamamatsu detectors were used for 6 targets
observed at Gemini North in this work. In the case of
Gemini South, all the spectra presented here were obtained with Hamamatsu detectors similar to those at
Gemini North. The differences in resolution, detectors,
and/or gratings across instruments had no siginificant
affect on our final asteroid spectra, largely because we
re-bin the final spectra by a factor of approximately 30
to decrease resolution and increase the signal-to-noise
ratio of our faint targets. Such coarse binning effectively
cancels the subtle differences across the instruments and
detectors.
All spectra were acquired using the same observing sequence. Each target was observed with 6×300 seconds
individual exposures. Both GMOS instruments, either
before or after upgrade, are multi-CCD detectors which
cause small gaps in wavelength coverage. To obtain continuous wavelength coverage over the full 0.36-0.94 µm
range, the grating angle in the instrument was changed
to produce a dispersion offset of 10 nm between the first
three and last three exposures. For each grating offset,
three spatial nods separated by 15 arcsec along the slit
were used to enable sky background subtraction by taking the difference of pairs of images. Before or after each
observation of an NEO target a solar analog standard
star was observed using the same observation sequence
to correct for the solar spectral component and telluric

features. After the first 3 spectral exposures one flat
field was acquired with identical grating angle and telescope pointing as used for the target. Then, a second
flat field was acquired using the second grating angle
before the final three spectral exposures of the target
were obtained. Bias images and arc calibrations using a
Ne-Ar lamp were acquired during the day before or after the observations. Two different gratings, 150 (R150)
and 400 (R400) lines per mm, were used based on availability on the telescope for a given night.
2.2. DeVeny@DCT
The third instrument we employed was the DeVeny
spectrograph at Lowell Observatory’s 4.3 m DCT. The
DeVeny spectrograph was first known as the KPNO
White Spectrograph at the Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO). It was acquired by Lowell Observatory
in 1998 and used with the 72” Perkins telescope from
2005 to 2015, after which it was modified and installed
on the DCT instrument cube (Bida et al. 2014). The
DeVeny spectrograph is equipped with a 2048x512 e2v
CCD42-10 with 13.5 µm pixels. It was operated using
a grating of 150 lines per mm prodiving a dispersion of
0.43 nm/pixel and covering a spectral range from 0.32
to 1 µm. The same reduction procedure was used for
DeVeny data as for GMOS with only a few exceptions:
no spectral or spatial nodding was performed when observing and no cosmic ray cleaning was needed during
reductions. In total 32 NEOs were observed with this
instrument.
2.3. Data validation
To validate our reduction pipeline and observation
strategies, we compared our results with observations
acquired with other instruments by other teams (Table 1). We found two objects that were also observed in
the visible by the NEOSHIELD2 project (Perna et al.
2018) and six objects that were observed by the MITHNEOS project in the NIR (Binzel et al. 2019). Table 1
summarizes taxonomic classifications in the visible, IR,
and visible+near infrared (VISIR) spectral ranges for
the two NEOSHIELD2 objects, the six MITHNEOS objects, and three other objects from the literature.
For the NEOSHIELD2 objects, we find the same taxonomic type for one (K-type; object 2015 XE) while the
second, 2015 TM143, was found here to be Cgh versus
Cb by NEOSHIELD2. This difference may simply be
due to the low quality of our data at short wavelengths,
which precludes detection of a spectral downturn shortward of 0.5 µm that can be taxonomically diagnostic.
However, even though these are two different types, they
correspond to the same complex.

For the MITHNEOS data, even though these observations were not acquired in the same wavelengths regime
as MANOS, we were able to compare our results by constructing a composite VISIR spectrum. In all cases the
merging between the red end of the visible (GMOS) and
the blue end of the NIR (MITHNEOS) spectra are in
very good agreement. Figures 1 shows comparisons between our observations, the MITHNEOS survey using
the IRTF telescope, and the SMASSIR survey (Burbine
& Binzel 2002). We can see that all data generally agree
with one other, though there are some slope differences
in the NIR, possibly due to phase angle effects.
Taxonomic classification of VISIR spectra used the
MIT classification web service2 . For two out of the six
MITHNEOS cases (2014 RC and 2014 SF304), we obtain
identical classification. For two others (2013 PJ10 and
2013 BO76), Binzel et al. (2019) reported several possible classifications and ours match with one of these.
For the last two: 2010 CF19 is found to be within
the same complex (X-complex) while 2014 WF201 is fit
with two different complexes (Xc for MANOS and Ch
for MITHNEOS). In general, these overlapping results
across surveys are broadly consistent with one another
within the limitations (signal-to-noise, wavelength coverage) of each data set. We note that the more comprehensive VISIR classification can differ from the visibleor IR-only classifications. Thus for the purposes of our
analysis and to facilitate consistent comparisons across
data sets (§6), we only consider from here onwards NEOs
classified using visible data only and a single classification technique (§3).
As a further validation step for the DeVeny spectrograph and our reduction pipeline, we observed a few
well-studied objects (Table 1). For (1036) Ganymed and
(1981) Midas we obtained very good agreement with
previously published taxonomic classifications (Sr and
V respectively). In the case of (3752) Camillo we found
an Sr-type asteroid whereas De León et al. (2010) found
an Ld-type. However, the NIR data obtained by these
authors was not included in their taxonomic assignment
and seems to indicate an S-complex object as opposed
to an Ld-type. In addition polarimetric data (unpublished by M. Devogele) indicates an S-type classification.
Asteroid 2008 EZ5 is the one object studied here with
inconsistent classifications. The composite VISIR spectrum suggests an Sq classification while the individual
spectra suggest different classes (Cg for the visible and X
or D for the infrared). It is worth noting that the VISIR
spectrum, even though classified as a Sq-type, does not
2

MANOS spectroscopic results
match well with the Sq reference, and the near-IR component is relatively low signal-to-noise.
3. TAXONOMIC CLASSIFICATION

Taxonomic classification is used to group asteroids
based on the characteristics of their spectra. There
are several taxonomic classification schemes which have
been developed using different data sets covering different spectral ranges and resolutions. Taxonomic classification roughly differentiates between common mineralogical classes present in the asteroid population. Here
we make use of the Bus-DeMeo taxonomic classification
system (DeMeo et al. 2009), primarily developed for visible plus near-infrared wavelengths (0.45 to 2.45 µm).
Even though our dataset does not cover near-infrared
wavelengths, the Bus-DeMeo taxonomy is amongst the
most comprehensive and is very similar to the visibleonly Bus and Binzel system (Bus & Binzel 2002). Moreover, our spectra go beyond the 0.82 µm limit defining
the Bus and Binzel system. In order to make use of the
extra wavelength coverage (up to 1 µm for DeVeny), the
use of the Bus-DeMeo taxonomic classification system is
needed.
For the remainder of this work we will primarily consider just taxonomic complexes as opposed to individual
types. This allows better statistics (e.g. more objects
per group), moreover, the distinction between types inside a complex is based on subtle spectral variations
(slope, shallow absorption bands) that can only be properly resolved in high signal-to-noise spectra, which is
not always the case here. We define the S complex as
the collection of spectra belonging to the S, Sr, Sv, and
Sk-classes. We do not include the Sq class in the Scomplex, as done by DeMeo et al. (2009), but rather
in a Q-complex combining the Q and Sq-classes as defined by Binzel et al. (2004). The reasons for this are
the very high fraction of Q and Sq-types amongst NEOs
compared to the MBA population (objects on which the
DeMeo et al. (2014) system was based) and the correlation of Q and Sq-types with low degrees of space
weathering (§6.1). In addition, we do not include the
L, Ld, and K-classes in the S-complex as was done by
Binzel et al. (2004), because these types are likely compositionally distinct from the S-complex (Devogèle et al.
2018; Sunshine et al. 2008). The Ld class does not exist
in the Bus-Demeo taxonomy. We combine the K and
L-classes into the K complex as these two classes are
barely distinguishable at visible wavelengths. NIR data
are needed to clearly discriminate these two classes. Finally, we define the C-complex as the group of the B, C,
Cb, Cg, Ch, and Cgh-classes, and the X-complex as the
group of the X, Xc, Xk, and Xe-classes. In each of these

5

five complexes (S, Q, K, C, X) we have 35, 57, 18, 23,
and 50 objects respectively in the MANOS sample. On
the other hand, the A, D, O, R, T, and V are defined
as individual classes and are not included to any larger
complex.
In the following sections, we will compare our results
with those obtain by Perna et al. (2018) as part of the
NEOSHIELD2 project and by Binzel et al. (2004, 2019)
as part of the MITHNEOS survey. The NEOSHIELD2
database consists of 146 visible spectra classified in
the Bus-DeMeo system as determined by the webservice M4AST3 . This early version of the MITHNEOS
database contains visible spectra only, and principal
component analysis (PCA, e.g. Bus & Binzel 2002) was
used to classify their spectra. We are aware that more
recent databases of NEO spectra exist (e.g. Binzel et al.
2019), however the majority of these newer data are
near-infrared spectra only and thus do not compare directly to the MANOS sample. The Binzel et al. (2004)
sample also includes non-NEOs that are Mars crossers,
which we exclude from our analysis. In total we considered 286 spectra from the Binzel et al. (2004) dataset.
In order to compare the results from these different sources, one further step is needed. Comparing
taxonomic classifications obtained from different techniques can lead to erroneous statistics. Ours and the
NEOSHIELD2 dataset have been analysed using a chisquare technique. This involves finding a best fit to template spectra of each class by minimizing a chi-square
statistic. On the other hand, the Binzel et al. (2004,
2019) spectra have been classified using a PCA method.
To compare the three databases, we re-determined the
taxonomy of all the spectra presented in Binzel et al.
(2004, 2019) using the M4AST webservice. Surprisingly
we find that using the chi-square fitting method on the
Binzel et al. (2004, 2019) dataset leads to significant
variations in the fraction of S-complex (as defined by DeMeo et al. (2009)) asteroids: from 52.9 ± 4.3% for PCA
to 36.0 ± 3.5% for chi-squared. On the other hand, the
fraction of Q-type asteroids increased from 6.2 ± 1.5%
for PCA to 15.6 ± 2.3% for chi-squared, A-type from
0.35 ± 0.35% to 1.7 ± 0.8%, O-type from 1.7 ± 0.7 to
3.1 ± 1.0%, K-type from 2.4 ± 0.9% to 5.2 ± 1.3%, and
L-type from 2.4 ± 0.9% to 3.8 ± 1.1%. The uncertainties
on the reported fraction were computed by taking into
account Poisson statistics on the number of spectra for
each class. If we sum the increases in Q, A, O, K, and
L-types we retrieve the fraction of S-complex asteroids
previously determined by the PCA method. This sug3

gests that the chi-squared technique distributes objects
with 1 µm absorption features across a greater diversity
of spectral types than PCA. As such chi-squared-derived
taxonomic classifications will show an increase in the
number of Q, A, O, K, and/or L types (at the expense
of S-types) relative to PCA. We also see a decrease of
the X-complex fraction from 15.9 ± 2.3% to 10.8 ± 1.9%
and an increase of the C-complex from 7.3 ± 1.6% to
12.1 ± 2.0% when comparing chi-square to PCA. These
findings clearly demonstrate the need for an homogeneous taxonomic classification scheme. Thus, we also
determine the taxonomic classification of our data-set
using the M4AST webservice (which uses a chi-square
method analogous to our pipeline). As expected, we

find that the taxonomic classifications provided by our
pipeline are very similar to those obtained with M4AST.
Considering Poisson statistic, the difference between the
number of objects in the different class or complex stays
bellow 0.5 σ for half of them.
4. RESULTS

We report here the taxonomic classification of 210
NEOs observed in the framework of the MANOS
project. This database contains approximately 3%
of the currently known population of NEOs with size
D < 100 m. The distributions of H and equivalent
diameter D of the objects in the MANOS database
are displayed in Figure 2. The H magnitude has been

MANOS spectroscopic results
converted into equivalent diameter D considering the
average albedo (pV ) for each taxonomic class as reported by Thomas et al. (2011b). The mean H value of
our data set is around 25th magnitude. Taking into account the expected albedo for each taxonomic type and
the H magnitude of each object, the mean equivalent
diameter of all objects in the MANOS dataset is around
D = 50 meters, with the smallest objects expected to
be as small as 3 meters.
The taxonomic distribution in our dataset is reported
in Table 2 and as bar plots in Figure 3 in relative fraction
for each individual taxonomic class or complex. The
classes which are the most represented are the Q, X,
S, C, and K complexes with respectively 27.1 ± 3.6 %,
23.8 ± 3.4 %, 16.7 ± 2.8 %, 10.9 ± 2.3 %, and 8.6 ± 2.0
% of the full population.
In Figure 3 we compare our results with those of
NEOSHIELD2 (Perna et al. 2018) and our chi-squared
re-classification of the (Binzel et al. 2004, 2019) spectra.
The NEOSHIELD2 dataset contains 146 objects with a
mean H magnitude of 22 and mean equivalent diameter of 180 m (3 times larger than the MANOS sample).
The mean H magnitude of the Binzel dataset is 17.7
mag corresponding to an equivalent diameter of approximately 1 kilometer (20 times larger than the MANOS
sample). These three datasets are highly complementary and sample very different size regimes in the NEO
population with MANOS providing the majority of spectra for H > 23 or D < 100 m. These samples also differ
in their orbital element distributions (§ 5). The full
combined MANOS+MITHNEOS+NEOSHIELD2 sample contains 642 spectra in roughly equal proportion
across the three surveys.
In Table 2, we report the number of spectra and relative fraction in each taxonomic class or complex for each
dataset. We also report the deviation between our data
and the NEOSHIELD2 and MITHNEOS datasets. This
deviation corresponds to the fractional difference between the two surveys divided by the uncertainty on this
difference computed by uncertainty propagation. The
main difference we find is a net decrease in the fraction
of S complex NEOs in the MANOS dataset. The fraction of S complex asteroids is 22.7 ± 2.8% in the MITHNEOS and 26.0 ± 4.2% in the NEOSHIELD2 datasets
while it is only 16.7 ± 2.8% in MANOS. These numbers
correspond to differences compared to MANOS of 1.7
and 1.8 sigma for the NEOSHIELD2 and MITHNEOS
datasets, respectively. Hypotheses to explain these differences will be discussed in § 6.1. In addition, we see
a net increase in the fraction of X-complex asteroids
with 10.8 ± 1.9%, 17.2 ± 3.4%, and 23.8 ± 3.4% in the
MITHNEOS, NEOSHIELD2, and MANOS datasets re-

7

spectively. This corresponds to an increase of 2.9 sigma
between MITHNEOS and MANOS. X-complex asteroids will be discussed in detail in § 6.2. The fraction of K-complex in the MITHNEOS survey is comparable with the fraction observed by MANOS while
NEOSHIELD2 observed a much smaller fraction. However, due to the very shallow absorption band characterizing the K-complex at visible wavelengths, this result
could be related to differences in wavelength coverage
betweem instruments and surveys.
5. OBSERVATIONAL BIASES

Biases are inherent to any survey, either intentional
as with the MANOS focus on small size and low ∆v, or
unintentional like the discovery bias toward high albedo
objects (see Granvik et al. (2018) for a detailed discussion about the discovery bias of NEO discovery surveys).
∆v in this context is defined as the impulse needed
for a spacecraft to maneuver from low Earth orbit to
a rendezvous with the asteroid in its orbit. It can be
computed for NEOs using the approximation described
by Shoemaker & Helin (1978). In this section we discuss several of these biases to understand their effect on
the observed population and taxonomic distribution of
NEOs measured by each of the surveys discussed in this
work. A more detailed de-biasing of our sample will be
the focus of a future publication.
5.1. Bias towards high albedo
The first bias is a discovery and observational bias towards high albedo asteroids. When observed at visible
wavelengths, for similar sizes, high albedo asteroids are
brighter and can be more easily discovered and characterized. This bias leads to an observational preference
for high albedo classes such as O, A, Q, or S, and underobservation of low albedo classes such as D or C. Discovery bias by the Catalina Sky Survey, currently the
predominant NEO discovery survey in the world, has
been extensively discussed in Granvik et al. (2018).
According to Stuart & Binzel (2004), the de-biased
fraction of S-complex NEOs is 22% while MITHNEOS
observed 31.8 ± 3.2% (S+K complexes reported here)
and MANOS 25.7 ± 3.5%. We also note that the
de-biased fraction of Q complex is estimated to be
around 14% while MITHNEOS observed 29.4 ± 3.2%
and MANOS 27.1 ± 3.6% . The S and Q complexes
are represented by high albedo asteroids (respectively
0.26 and 0.29 according to Thomas et al. (2011b)).
On the other hand low albedo classes such as D types
(pV = 0.02) have an de-biased population estimated
to be around 17% while only 4.5 ± 1.2% and 1.9 ±
0.9% were observed by MITHNEOS and MANOS respectively. These statistics clearly show the expected

over-observation of high albedo and under-observation
of low albedo asteroids.
5.2. Bias toward low MOID
Bias toward high albedo is not the only bias present
in our sample. MANOS focuses on small objects,
which due to their intrinsic faintness are necessarily low
MOID objects in order to be observable. This introduces a strong selection effect that biases our observed
taxonomic distribution relative to other surveys. The
mean MOID for the MITHNEOS, NEOSHIELD2, and
MANOS surveys are respectively 0.113, 0.083, and 0.016
AU. Figure 4 is a simple illustration of this MOID bias.
It shows a plot of the absolute H magnitude as a function of the logarithm of the MOID in AU for all aster-

oids considered in this work. We can clearly see that
as H magnitude increases, high MOIDs are no longer
observed.
Low MOIDs may have consequences for the surface
properties of these asteroids. These asteroids, by definition, are making close approaches to the Earth. These
approaches can result in tidal forces that induce surface
rejuvenation, effectively suppressing the effects of spaceweathering (Binzel et al. 2010). This would then suggest
an increase in the fraction of fresh, unweathered spectral types in the MANOS data set. In §6.1 we discuss
possible reasons for why this is not the case.

5.3. Orbital elements biases

MANOS spectroscopic results

Figure 3. Taxonomic distribution of NEOs in the MANOS,
NEOSHIELD2, and chi-squared reclassified MITHNEOS
spectroscopic databases in relative percentage. The fraction of S-complex NEOs is lower in the MANOS database
while the fraction of X-complex is higher in MANOS and
NEOSHIELD2 compared to MITHNEOS.

Figure 4. Plot of the absolute H magnitude as a function of
the MOID for asteroids in the MITHNEOS, NEOSHIELD2
and MANOS databases . High MOID asteroids are no longer
observed as the H magnitude increases

The MANOS survey focuses on low MOID, low ∆v
asteroids. Observing exclusively low ∆v asteroids is introducing a bias towards semi-major axis around a = 1
AU, low eccentricity e, and low inclination i. This bias
can be seen in Figure 5 which shows the semi-major axis
a, eccentricity e, and inclination i as a function of the
∆v for each survey considered in our analysis. This plot
also shows the 90th percentile ∆v limits for the different
surveys which correspond to ∆v = 9.08, 10.78, and 6.44
km/s for the MITHNEOS, NEOSHIELD2, and MANOS
surveys, respectively. We can see that by focusing on low
∆v objects, MANOS ignores high eccentricity and high
inclination targets, while the semi-major axes of our targets are generally closer to that of the Earth compared
to other surveys.

9

The MANOS bias toward Earth-like semi-major axis
and low eccentricity naturally introduces a bias toward
Earth-like perihelia. Figure 6 represents the perihelion
distance of all the objects considered in this work as a
function of their ∆v. As with Figure 5, the horizontal lines correspond to the 90th percentile ∆v lines for
the individual surveys. The vertical line corresponds to
the semi-major axis of Venus. Note that the 90th percentile ∆v of MANOS coincidentally corresponds to the
semi-major axis of Venus. This means that MANOS
targets have a lower probability of making a close encounter with Venus than objects observed in the other
surveys. For example, assuming a = 1 AU and i = 0◦ ,
the median ∆v for each survey corresponds to minimum
perihelia of 0.57, 0.67, and 0.78 AU for MITHNEOS,
NEOSHIELD2, and MANOS respectively (lower perihelion could be reachable for the same ∆v considering lower semi-major axis values, however objects with
a < 1 only represent 9% of all the objects considered in
this work). This bias towards Earth-like perihelia also
introduces a bias towards higher Venus MOID in the
MANOS sample. The fraction of objects with Venus
MOID smaller than 0.02 AU is respectively 5.2, 5.5, and
0.9% in the MITHNEOS, NEOSHIELD2, and MANOS
surveys. Similar to the process that occurs due to Earth
encounters Binzel et al. (2010), a low MOID to Venus is
expected to increase the likelihood of planetary encounters and thus the chance for surface re-freshening events
that can affect spectral type. The effect of having a low
MOID to Earth and Venus is important while considering the S and Q-complexes. This will be discussed in
detail in Sec. 6.1.
These orbital element biases also introduce a bias toward specific source regions in the Main Belt. Near
Earth Asteroids originate from different regions in the
Main Belt known to be taxonomically heterogeneous
(DeMeo et al. 2014). NEO orbital elements contain
a vestige of their original Main Belt source region,
thus their escape region probability can be determined
(Granvik et al. 2018). Granvik et al. (2018) considered
six different escape regions for the Near-Earth Asteroids – the Hungaria and Phocaea clusters, the ν6 and
the Jupiter resonances 5:2, 3:1, and 2:1 – and provided
the orbital steady state distribution of the NEOs originating from these regions. The MANOS survey is biased towards Earth-like perihelia and low inclination.
The Phocaea region is characterized by a relatively small
semi-major axis and eccentricity, but has very high inclination (i ∼ 30◦ ). Since only 5% of the MANOS objects
have inclination higher than 14◦ , objects from the Phocaea region should be very rare in the MANOS sample. On the other hand, 47% and 27% of the objects

for some MANOS objects. A detailed analysis of this
issue is beyond the scope of this work.

in the MITHNEOS and NEOSHIELD2 surveys respectively have an inclination higher than 14◦ . In the case of
the MANOS sample, the same bias against Phocaeas is
also true for the Hungaria region, but to a lesser extent
since their inclination is smaller (i ∼ 20◦ ). The ν6 , 5:2,
3:1, and 2:1 source regions originate at semi-major axis
around 2.2, 2.5, 2.7, and 3.2 AU respectively. Thus, at
face value, the most likely source region for MANOS targets seems to be the ν6 resonance: our dataset includes
only 6.5% of objects with a > 2.2 AU, 2% with a > 2.5
AU, and only one object with a > 2.7 AU. However, the
low MOID values characteristic of our sample suggest
that MANOS objects may have an increased likelihood
to have lost the memory of their source regions due to
close interactions with Earth. As such it may be nontrivial to unambiguously determine the source regions

The main difference between the three surveys discussed in this work is the size of the observed objects.
The median H magnitude is respectively 17.5, 21, and 25
mag for the MITHNEOS, NEOSHIELD2, and MANOS
samples. The fraction of objects coming from different
Main Belt source regions is dependent on size (Granvik
et al. 2018). Table 3 summarizes the fraction of NEOs
coming from each source region according to Granvik
et al. (2018) for H lower than 17.5, 21, and 25 mag.
Even though these statistics are representative of the
cumulative distribution, the number of objects in the
population increase so quickly with H that for a given
H cutoff larger objects become negligible in terms of
their contribution to the presented fractions. This can
be seen for the Phocaea objects which decrease from 7
to 0.02% for H < 17.5 and H < 25 mag.
Table 3 indicates that objects from the Phocaea cluster, and the Jupiter resonances of 2:1, and 5:2 are negligible contributors to the MANOS sample, whereas they
account for 29 and 17% respectively in the MITHNEOS
and NEOSHIELD2 surveys. The main increase in the
MANOS sample comes from the Hungaria region which
increases by a factor of 2.1 compared to the MITHNEOS sample, and 4.8 compared to the NEOSHIELD2
survey. The 3:1 fraction increases by a factor of 1.9
compared to the MITHNEOS survey and is similar to
that for NEOSHIELD2. The ν6 fraction is similar for
MANOS and MITHNEOS, and increases by 10% for the
NEOSHIELD2 sample. The taxonomy distribution in
each of these source regions is different and since the contribution of each one is directly dependant on size, the

taxonomy distribution of the NEO population should
also be dependant on object size. These variations of
the taxonomy distribution with size will be discussed in
detail in §6.1 for the Q and S complexes, and §6.2 for
the A-type and X-complex.
6. DISCUSSION

In this section the observed variation of the taxonomic distribution in the MANOS database compared to
the NEOSHIELD2 and MITHNEOS will be discussed.
While combining these three different data-sets, trends
are also observed as a function of size (H magnitude),
MOID, or orbital elements.
The first two sections will focus on specific classes or
complexes while the last section will focus on one specific mechanism. Section 6.1 is devoted to the S and
Q complexes. The total fraction of S+Q complexes is
observed to decrease as a function of size. Mechanisms
allowing S to turn onto Q-complex asteroids will be discussed. The Q/S ratio is found to vary as a function
the Earth and Venus MOID as well as perihelion distance. Section 6.2 will discuss A-type and X-complex
for which a relative increase compare to other taxonomic
type/complex is observed as a function of size. The last
section is about the size/density dependent disaggregation of asteroids (Scheeres 2018). This only mechanism
can possibly explain the overall observed variation of the
taxonomy distribution as a function of size.
6.1. S and Q-complex asteroids
S- and Q-complex asteroids are compositionally related. Q-type asteroids have been linked to the fresh surface of ordinary chondrite meteorites (McFadden et al.
1985; Nakamura et al. 2011). The surface of such an
asteroid, when exposed to the space environment, sees

11

its reflectance properties change due to space weathering. For ordinary chondrites, the effects of spaceweathering include an increase in spectral slope, a lowering of albedo, and a reduction of absorption band depth.
These processes turn Q-types to S-type asteroids (Chapman 1996).
The fraction of S-complex asteroids is significantly
lower in the MANOS sample compared to MITHNEOS
and NEOSHIELD2. We examine all objects with ordinary chondrite-like compositions by combining the
fractions of the S- and Q-complexes which represents
52.1, 51.4, and 43.8% respectively for the MITHNEOS,
NEOSHIELD2 and MANOS samples. Figure 7 represents the running mean of the observed S+Q fraction
as a function of H magnitude across all three surveys.
It can be seen that the S+Q fraction goes from 60%
for H = 16 mag down to 48% for H = 17.4 mag, and
42% for H = 25 mag. We also see an interesting peak
around H=22 mag with a fraction of 60%. The decrease
of the S+Q fraction as a function of H can tentatively
be explained by a variation of the source regions of the
objects as a function of size. Since the Phocaea asteroids
are primarily composed of S-complex asteroids (Carvano
et al. 2001) and their abundance amongst NEOs rapidly
decreases with size (Table 3), we expect to find of order 7% less S+Q-complex asteroids for H < 25 mag
compared to the fraction for H < 17.5 mag (assuming
Phocaea’s are 100% S-complex). This corresponds well
to the 8.3% decrease in S+Q asteroids observed in the
MANOS sample compared to MITHNEOS. The higher
fraction of S around H = 22 mag could be explained
by the higher fraction of asteroids coming from the ν6
(10% more than for H < 17.5 mag and 11% more than
for the MANOS sample). The implication of this interpretation for the non-uniform S+Q fraction is that
source regions in the Main Belt can produce taxonomic
or compositional variation within the NEO population
that is size dependent. Our analysis suggests that this
may be an observable signature.
Another tentative explanation for the S+Q fraction
trend could be that as body size decreases, surface properties, such as the mean grain size, change. All taxonomic classification systems have been defined based on
spectra of MBAs or large NEOs, which are expect to
have surfaces dominated by small grain sizes (Jaumann
et al. 2012; Robinson et al. 2001) that likely dominate
the optical properties at visible and near-infrared wavelengths. Such taxonomic systems may break down when
considering significantly different grain size regimes, for
example in the nearly regolith free surface of NEO
Ryugu. Evidence for changes in surface grain size as
a function of object diameter has been seen with such

12

Devogèle et al.

in-situ observations of NEOs (Dombard et al. 2010; Tancredi et al. 2015; Michikami et al. 2018). Indirect evidence for the possibility of different surface properties
includes the significantly different centripetal accelerations on the surfaces of small objects, where rotation periods less than 20 seconds have been observed (Thirouin
et al. 2018). Such rapid rotation could have implications
for the retention of small grains on the surfaces of these
bodies. Note that the peak around H = 22 mag in Figure 7 closely corresponds to the transition from purely
gravity dominated rubble piles to bodies where cohesion
can play a significant role in dictating internal structure
and strength (Scheeres et al. 2010). However, it is not
clear why a peak in the S+Q fraction would occur at
this transition.
Size-dependent changes in surface properties were also
predicted by models for objects with low planetary
MOID (i.e. those experiencing frequent planetary encounters like in the MANOS sample). These objects
can experience gravitationally induced seismic shaking,
which can affect surface grain size distributions (Maurel et al. 2016). The implication of these interpretations
of the S+Q fraction is that NEOs can have fundamentally different surfaces as a function of size. This can be
directly tested with additional in situ spacecraft observations of NEOs across a range of sizes, and telescopic
observations that can constrain surface grain properties
such as measurements of thermal inertia (e.g. MacLennan & Emery 2018; Hanuš et al. 2015) or polarimetric
phase curves (e.g. Cellino et al. 2018; Devogèle et al.
2018).

Figure 7. Running mean of the number of S+Q complex
asteroids across the MANOS, NEOSHIELD2, and MITHNEOS samples as a function of H magnitude. The shaded
area corresponds to the uncertainties taking into account
Poisson statistics. This change could be due to size dependent differences in Main Belt source region and/or size dependent surface properties like grain size.

In order to analyze the role of planetary encounters in surface alteration, we consider the Q/S ratio.
One model for S-type asteroids to turn into Q-type involves surface re-freshening during planetary encounters
(Nesvornỳ et al. 2005). In order to make a close planetary encounter, an object must have a low MOID relative to the planet. This model is supported by our
data since the Q/S ratio for the MANOS survey is Q/S
= 1.6 ± 0.3, while it is only 1.3 ± 0.2 and 1 ± 0.2
for the MITHNEOS and NEOSHIELD2 surveys respectively. This is expected because MANOS is biased toward low MOID asteroids. However, these Q/S ratios
are only marginally significant in their difference when
taking into account uncertainties based on the size of
each sample. One can also compares the fractions of Sq
and Q sub-type objects (here Q-types is considered as its
individual class without taking into account the Sq objects). We see that the Q/Sq ratios for the MANOS,
NEOSHIELDS2, and MITHNEOS surveys are equals
within the uncertainties with respectively 0.8 ± 0.2, 0.8
±0.3, and 1.1 ± 0.3.
Figure 8 represents the running mean of MOID, over
the full sample, in bin sizes of 100 asteroids as a function of the Q/S ratio for the Earth, Venus, and Mars.
In the case of Earth, the Q/S ratio does not go to zero
for the highest MOID, but stabilizes around a 1:1 ratio
at MOID > 0.1 AU. These high MOID asteroids are too
distant to experience close encounters with Earth. Including Mars-crosser asteroids in this analysis, the Q/S
ratio decreases to 0.33, but does not go to zero. By definition these objects have a MOID larger than 0.3 AU
and have no interaction with Earth. Either interactions
with Mars or some other surface refreshing mechanism
that doesn’t involve planetary encounters (e.g. collisional origin in the Main Belt, or YORP spin-up) are
likely responsible for the Q-types in this Mars crosser
population (DeMeo et al. 2014). We note that while a
very close planetary approach (< 1 lunar distance) is actually needed to refresh the surface of an asteroid, this
plot only considers instantaneous MOID. As pointed-out
by Binzel et al. (2010), Q-type asteroids with MOID as
large as 0.15 AU can have a MOID as small as 10−5
AU in the past 105 years. They also noted that not all
asteroids with very low MOID in the recent past are Qtypes. This fact is relevant to the following discussion
on Venus MOID, Mars MOID, and perihelion distance.
Considering Q and Sq-type as separate classes, we observe that the Q/S and Sq/S ratio as a function of MOID
distances, for each planets, are well withing the error bar
associated to each curves. Thus, no differences can be
seen between Q and Sq-types. In other words, the Sq/Q
ratio remains constant for any MOID within error bars.

Figure 8. Running mean of the ratio between the number of Q and S asteroids across the MANOS, NEOSHIELD2, and
MITHNEOS samples as a function of the Earth, Venus, and Mars MOID (respectively from left to right). The shaded areas
correspond to the uncertainties considering Poisson statistic for the S and Q complexes fractions and uncertainties propagation.

Asteroids with high Earth MOID can also have low
MOID relative to other planets such as Venus. The effectiveness of a planetary body to refresh an asteroid
surface depends on the mass of the planet. This makes
Venus nearly as effective as the Earth, while Mars is expected to be much less efficient. The middle panel of
Figure 8 represents the running mean of the Q/S ratio as a function of Venus MOID. We can see that as
for the Earth the Q/S fraction increases with smaller
MOID. We can also see that the increase starts further
from the planet than for Earth. This is interpreted as
the fact that an asteroid, observable from the Earth,
which would have a low Venus MOID can also have a
low MOID relative to the Earth, increasing the probability of planetary encounters. On the other hand, the
right hand panel of Figure 8 represents the case of the
Mars MOID where no increase of the Q/S ratio is seen.
This is consistent with Mars being much less effective
than the Earth and Venus in converting S to Q-type
asteroids.
Related to these MOID relationships, the Q/S ratio is
also dependant on orbital elements. The top left panel
of Figure 9 represents the semi-major axis a versus eccentricity e for S and Q-complex asteroids. While the
S-complex asteroids predominantly remain near the 1
AU perihelion line, a non-negligible fraction of the Qcomplex asteroids plot well above this line. The other
panels of Figure 9 represent the distribution in semimajor axis (bottom left), eccentricity (top right), and
perihelion distance (bottom right) for the S and Q complexes. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) analysis rejects
with 99.9% confidence the null hypothesis that the eccentricity and perihelion distributions of Q and S complex asteroids are drawn from the same distribution (Table 4). On the other hand, the same test for the semimajor axis shows that the null hypothesis can only be
rejected with 63% confidence. This means that the dis-

tribution of semi-major axis for Q and S is the same,
but they are significantly different in terms of eccentricity and hence perihelion as well. Another important
observation of Figure 9 is that the relative fraction of Scomplex asteroids is rapidly decreasing with lower perihelion distance while the relative fraction of Q-complex
is not. This rapid decrease of S-complex objects coincides with perihelion distances inside of Venus’ orbit.
This suggests the intriguing possibility that Venus, in
addition to the Earth, may play a role in the generation
of Q-type asteroids.

(N=91) and Q sub-types (N=87) (treated as separate
classes) shows that the null hypotheses can be rejected,
for both, with a confidence higher than 99%. However
comparing the perihelion distribution of Sq with that
of the Q sub-type shows that the null distribution can
only be rejected with 89% confidence, suggesting that
these two distributions are more likely to come from the
same population. We also find that the confidence level
for rejection is higher when comparing S-complex perihelia to Q-types than when comparing the S-complex
to Sq-types. Comparing the eccentricity distributions,
we find that the distributions of the S-complex and Sqtype are likely to come from the same population while
the populations of the S-complex and Q-type are different. Overall these results are suggestive of a continuous
transition from the S-complex to the Sq-type and then
to the Q-type as a function of eccentricity and (by extensive) perihelion. In the case of semi-major axis, all
distributions are identical.
As such we consider the running mean of the Q/S
ratio as a function of perihelion distance (Figure 10). As
expected the Q/S ratio increases with lower perihelion.
However, this increase is not linear, but has two distinct
changes in slope corresponding closely to the perihelion

this ratio at perihelion distances greater than 1.03 AU is
unclear. Mars does not appear to have the same effect
that Earth and Venus do in resurfacing objects during
close encounters (Figure 8). It is possible that objects
recently escaped from the Main Belt are Q-types, for
example following collisional removal from a precursor
parent body, and thus are affecting the Q/S ratio at
larger perihelion distances.

bins as a function of perihelion distance. The shaded areas
correspond to the uncertainties considering Poisson statistic
for the S and Q complexes fractions and uncertainties propagation. The semi-major axis of the Earth (1 AU) and Venus
(0.723 AU) are shown by blue and red lines respectively.
We can see that the Q/S ratio changes slope at perihelion
distances around Earth and Venus. We interpret the large
increase between Earth and Venus as a mutual influence of
both planets modifying surfaces through planetary encounters.

distances of Earth and Venus. We also note that there
is a plateau for objects with perihelion between 0.88 and
1 AU. These objects encounter Earth, but stay far away
from Venus. The maximum Q/S ratio is around 4.9
for perihelia near the semi-major axis of Venus. This
suggests that Venus plays a role in the refreshening of
S-complex asteroid surfaces. The minimum Q/S ratio is
0.30 at a perihelion distance of 1.03 AU, just outside of
the Earth’s orbit. The cause of the modest increase in

We saw previously that the MANOS survey’s focus on
low ∆v objects causes a bias against low Venus MOID
objects compared to the NEOSHIELD2 and MITHNEOS surveys (Figure 6). As Venus seems to play a
role towards increasing the Q/S ratio, this bias should
produce a smaller Q/S ratio in the MANOS sample,
whereas the MANOS bias towards lower Earth MOID
targets should act in the opposite manner. The relative importance of these biases in the MANOS sample
remains unclear.
The non-zero Q/S ratio for asteroids which do not interact with Earth or Venus could be explained in several
ways:
• MOID is not a static value but instead evolves with
time. Asteroids with a large MOID to Venus and
Earth today might have had much lower MOIDs in
the past. Backwards orbital integrations, similar
to those performed by Binzel et al. (2010), could

MANOS spectroscopic results
lend insight into this possibility, but is beyond the
scope of this work.
• The fresh Q-type surfaces could come from a collision with another asteroid. However, the collision
probability in near-Earth space is much lower than
in the Main Belt. Asteroids would then have to
enter NEO space as Q-types instead of S-type. A
counter would be that very few Q-complex objects
have been found in the MBA, though the studied
size regimes are very different. Spectra for MBAs
are mainly for objects with D > 5 km while most
of the NEOs have D < 5 km. It was also found
that small objects from recent dynamical families
are more likely to display a fresh Q-type surface
(Thomas et al. 2011a).
• Asteroids can experience spin rate changes due
to the YORP effect. This acceleration can cause
surface material to migrate towards the equator
or even escape the surface (Walsh et al. 2008),
thus exposing fresh un-weathered terrain. Indeed,
some asteroids pairs that were recently formed by
the rotational-fission process were found to display fresh Q-type surfaces (Polishook et al. 2014).
Combining spectral and rotational data could provide insight into this possibility.
• Regolith formation processes such as thermal fatigue (Delbó et al. 2014) are expected to be independent of MOID and are also strongly dependent on perihelion distance. This could help to
explain the background of Q-complex objects in
near-Earth space.
6.2. X-complex and A-type asteroids
The fraction of X-complex and A-type asteroids increases significantly in the MANOS and NEOSHIELD2
surveys compared to the MITHNEOS survey.
Figure 11 shows the density distribution of objects in
the A-class and X-complex as a function of semi-major
axis a. The blue curve represents the full dataset and
serves as a reference. This curve is characterized by a
bi-modal distribution with a main peak at 1.275 AU and
a secondary peak at 2.1 AU, corresponding to the inner
edge of the Main Belt. There are only two escape regions with a < 2.1 AU for objects to leave the Main
Belt and enter the NEO population. These correspond
to the Hungaria and Phocaea asteroid families. Objects
in these families can be destabilized by mean motion
resonances with Mars and Jupiter, and to a lesser extent Earth, Venus, and Saturn (McEachern et al. 2010).
Several secular resonances such as the ν5 , ν6 , or ν17 can

15

also play an important role in NEO delivery from these
regions (Warner et al. 2009). No significant resonances
exist around 1.275 AU, whereas the peak at 2.1 AU corresponds to a peak of asteroids in the de-biased NEO
population (Granvik et al. 2018).

Figure 11. Density distribution of NEOs for the A-types
and X-complex as a function of semi-major axis. The red
vertical line corresponds to the semi-major axis of the orbit
of Mars. The green and blue vertical lines correspond to
the location of the 2:1 Earth and 3:1 Jupiter mean motion
resonances.

A-type asteroids are uncommon all over the mainasteroid belt. DeMeo et al. (2019) reported fractions
of A-types for the inner, mid, and outer main belt to
be 0.22%, 0.14%, and 0.11% respectively. These values
are more than 10 times lower than those found in the
MANOS and NEOSHIELD2 database. However, the
fraction of chi-squared classified A-types in the MITHNEOS sample is 4.9 times higher than the fraction of
PCA classified A-types. Taking this into account, the
PCA classified fraction of A-types in the MANOS sample is estimated to be 0.8 ± 0.3. This number is more in
accordance, however still 4 times higher, with the estimated fraction of A-type in the Main Belt.
This over-abundance of A-types observed in the
MANOS database could be an effect of the observation bias toward high albedo objects. A-types are high
albedo (∼0.3-0.5) objects (DeMeo et al. 2019). This
effect is expected to be stronger for smaller size object
which are harder to discover and characterize.
On the other hand, one has to keep mind that subkilometer asteroids cannot be observed in the Main Belt
and their fraction cannot be observationally estimated.
An indirect estimation by Turrini et al. (2016) suggested
that a fraction of 0.7% sub-kilometer A-types in the
Main Belt could explain olivine patches detected on the
surface of Vesta.

16

Devogèle et al.

If A-types are distributed more or less evenly throughout the main-belt, some regions in the Solar System
show over-densities. In that matter, a cluster of 11 asteroids within the fifth Lagrangian point of Mars, was
dynamically associated with the asteroid (5261) Eureka,
the largest object in the group (Christou 2013). Three of
them were found to have A-type spectra (in both the visible and near-IR regime (Borisov et al. 2017; Polishook
et al. 2017a)). Based on the rarity of A-type asteroids,
it is likely that these asteroids share a common heritage.
Polishook et al. (2017a) suggested this common origin
involved impact ejection from Mars. The Hungaria region is also known to display an over-density of A-type
asteroids. A recent spectroscopic survey by Lucas et al.
(2018) reported a relative A-type fraction of 1.5% in
the Hungaria region. An other estimates by DeMeo &
Carry (2013) suggested that 7% of the mass of the Hungaria group is of A-type. However more recent studies
(DeMeo et al. 2019) suggests a much smaller value of
0.26%.
The A-type population observed in the MANOS survey shows an excess of objects located at semi-major
axes around 1.6 AU and is associated with a deficiency
of objects below 1.3 and over 2.1 AU (see Fig. 11). The
location of this peak corresponds with the 1:2 Earth
mean motion resonance which provides the means for
Hungaria family asteroids to enter the NEO region.
In addition, the fraction of A-types in the NEO region
was found to be size dependent, increasing with smaller
sizes (Perna et al. 2018). This may be consistent with
an increase of the fraction of A-type with smaller size in
the main belt (Turrini et al. 2016) or the NEO source
region models. As discussed earlier, the relative fraction
of Hungaria asteroids in the NEO population increases
from 11% for H < 17.5 mag to 24% for H < 25 mag.
This is consistent with an increase of A-types by a factor
of 2.3 between the MITHNEOS and MANOS surveys.
On the other hand, the predicted fraction of Hungaria
NEOs (A-types and others) is only 5% for H < 21 mag,
which seems inconsistent with the high fraction (∼ 5%)
of A-types in the NEOSHIELD2 sample.
Considering these observed properties of A-type asteroids, we suggest that the over-abundance of A-types
in NEO space compared to the observed fraction in the
Main Belt could be due to either an observation bias
toward high albedo asteroids, an increase of the fraction of A-type for unobserved sub-kilometer A-type in
the main-belt or a variation of the feeding source region
of NEO as a function of size. In the latter scenario Atype NEOs would then be relic pieces of Mars, which
is consistent with the fact that Martian meteorites have
been found on Earth. The last hypothesis would imply

the fact that some asteroids are mistakenly defined as
A-type if they are only observed in the visible. DeMeo
et al. (2019) found that only half of the A-types defined
by the visible regime are actually A-types, when you
observe them in the near-IR.
The X-complex, as with the A-types, also shows a
strong peak at small a (Figure 11). The Hungaria region is composed of roughly 56% X-type asteroids (Lucas et al. 2018). The X-complex regroups three old taxonomic classes which are distinguished by albedo pV ,
but are otherwise spectroscopically similar. P-types are
characterized by pV < 0.14, M-types have 0.14 < pV <
0.30, and E-types have albedo higher than 0.30 (Tholen
1984). X-types in the Hungaria region are almost exclusively E-type asteroids (Lucas et al. 2018).
From the 106 X-complex asteroids reported in this
work, thirteen of them have an albedo measured by NEOWISE. Of these 13, two are consistent with an E-type
classification, thus suggesting that 16 ± 11 of the Xcomplex objects in this study are E-type, representing
2.5 ± 1.7% of the full sample considered here. From the
NEO population with 17 < H < 22 mag (the X-types
for which we have albedo information are exclusively in
this range), 5.6% come from the Hungaria region (Table 3). As only 56% of Hungarias are E-type, the expected fraction of E-type asteroids in our sample is 3.1%.
This number is consistent with the 2.5 ± 1.7% suggested
by the observations. Specific to MANOS, if the fraction of Hungaria asteroids increases to 24% in the range
17 < H < 25 mag, as suggested by Granvik et al. (2018),
then we might expect to find many more E-types in the
MANOS sample. Unfortunately only four MANOS targets have an albedo determination. Of those four, one
is an X-type with a high albedo, i.e. is an E-type. A
larger sample of small NEO albedos, particularly in the
range 22 < H < 25 mag, would serve to further test this
predicted contribution of Hungaria E-types to the NEO
population.
We also note that, only the X-types show a significant
increase in the MANOS survey: their abundance increases by 61% relative to MITHNEOS. However, the Xcomplex combines asteroids with a high diversity of albedos, from very dark P-types (pV < 0.14) to very bright
E-types (pV > 0.30). The reported mean albedo of Xtypes by Thomas et al. (2011b) is pV = 0.31, whereas
Stuart & Binzel (2004) reported only pV = 0.06. The
bias toward observation of high albedo combined with
the increase of high albedo X-type asteroids from the
Hungarias region might explain the rapid increasing of
X-type while observing smaller asteroids.
6.3. Catastrophic disaggregation of asteroids

17

MANOS spectroscopic results
Several processes leading to full or partial disaggregation of asteroids have been suggested. First, Scheeres
(2018) proposed a mechanism leading to the full disruption of small asteroids when reaching a spin rate threshold. The size limit at which such full dissagregation
would occur is dependent on density (R0 ∝ 1/ρ). On
the other hand, the time needed for a body to experience a full disaggregation is also proportional on the
density. A low density asteroid will start to disaggregate at larger radius, but would take longer time than a
high density one. We also note that R0 ∼ 100 m which
corresponds to the transition between NEOSHIED2 and
MANOS data. The effect on the observed population of
object smaller than 100 m is still unclear, but it might
result in variation of the fraction of asteroids of different
compositions as a function of size and density.
Taking into account density estimations for the different taxonomic types (Carry 2012), we see that C and
S-complex are the lowest density (∼ 2.1) while A-type
and X and K-complex have relatively higher densities
(∼ 3.7). For complexes, we report here the mean value
of all type belonging to the complex (see Carry (2012)
for individual estimation for individual types). These
densities have been derived based on large main-belt
asteroids which might not reflect the true densities of
NEOs. However, even if the NEOs possess larger macroporosity due to their smaller size, we are interested here
in the relative variation of the density as a function of
the taxonomic type and not the absolute values.
If MANOS is observing objects around this transition, then this effect could be a reason for the observed
diminution of S-types relative to the higher density X,
A, and K-types. Moreover, the size of an object component parts (i.e. boulders) might also be dependant on
density, thus also contributing to different taxonomic
distributions at small sizes.
The second mechanism involve the catastrophic disruption of asteroids due to solar heating at small perihelion distance (Granvik et al. 2016). This mechanism
is also size dependent, but also albedo, and perihelion
distance dependent.
The catastrophic disruption of an asteroid due to solar
heating is expected to happen at perihelion distances too
low to affect the MANOS dataset which mainly focus on
asteroid with perihelion distance close to 1 AU. Even if
the perihelion distance at which this catastrophic disruption occurs is dependent on the asteroid size, the average disruption distance pass from 0.06 AU to 0.18 for
H magnitude from 18 to 24, only 8 targets in MANOS
dataset possess a q < 0.7 AU. Moreover, the perihelion
distribution for high and low albedo asteroids for asteroids with q > 0.6 AU is found to be similar while it is

not while considering the full NEO population (Granvik
et al. 2016). Even if this analysis was made on large asteroids, this effect is expected to be negligible for Earth
like perihelion MANOS target.
7. CONCLUSIONS

The MANOS project is a survey of small, low ∆v,
low MOID NEOs employing spectroscopic, photometric,
and astrometric techniques. As part of this survey we
present 210 new visible spectra. The mean H of the
MANOS database is around 25 mag which corresponds
to a mean equivalent diameter of 50 m. In this paper we
presented the taxonomic distribution of these objects.
We compared the taxonomic distribution of the
MANOS dataset with other datasets of visible NEO
spectra (MITHNEOS and NEOSHIELD2). These two
surveys sample asteroids that are generally larger than
those studied by MANOS. Comparing the taxonomic
distribution across surveys we find:
• The fraction of S-complex asteroids in the MANOS
database of 16.7 ± 2.8% is lower than the fraction
in the NEOSHIELD2 and MITHNEOS database
which are respectively 26.0 ± 4.2 and 22.7 ± 2.8%.
The reason for this decrease is unclear but could be
due to an observational selection of lower MOID
asteroids in the MANOS sample. The decrease
of S-complex could be partially explained by a
refreshing of the asteroid’s surfaces during close
approaches with Earth, Venus, and/or Mars, causing a change in surface features from S to Q-type.
This is supported by the fact that the Q/S ratio is increasing in the MANOS database (1.3 in
MITHNEOS, 1.0 in NEOSHIELD2, and 1.6 in
MANOS).
• The fraction of S+Q-complex asteroids in the
MANOS database of 43.8 ± 4.6% is lower than the
fraction in the NEOSHIELD2 and MITHNEOS
database which are respectively 51.4 ± 5.9 and
52.1 ± 4.2%. When combining these datasets this
decrease goes from 60% at H = 16 mag to 42%
at H = 26 mag. This could be explained by a decrease in the fraction of asteroids coming from the
Phocaea region at small sizes. Another possible
explanation would be changes in surface properties (e.g. grain size distribution) as a function of
size.
• The fraction of X-complex asteroids in the
MANOS database of 23.8 ± 3.4% is significantly
higher than the fraction in the MITHNEOS
database (10.8 ± 1.9%) and is about the same
as in the NEOSHIELD2 database (17.2 ± 3.4%).

18

Devogèle et al.
This increase of X-complex asteroids is interpreted
as both an increase in the fraction of NEOs from
the Hungaria family at small sizes (H > 22 mag)
and a discovery bias towards high albedo E-type
asteroids. The high fraction of Hungaria asteroids
is supported by the fact that 2 out of 13 X-types
with measured albedos are high, consistent with
an E-type classification and a Hungaria origin.
This seems to support NEO source region models
(e.g. Granvik et al. 2018) that predict NEOs of
different sizes preferentially come from different
parts of the Main Belt. However, this conclusion
is based on low number statistics. An albedo survey of X-type NEOs would provide further insight
into this scenario.
• The fraction of A-type asteroids in the MANOS
database of 3.5±1.2% lies between the fraction reported by NEOSHIELD2 (5.5±1.9 %) and MITHNEOS (1.7 ± 0.8 %). This increase compared to
the MITHNEOS database is interpreted, like the
X-types, as a combination of an increase of NEOs
coming from the Hungaria region at small sizes
and a bias toward high albedo objects. These Atypes would then potentially be pieces of Mars
ejected during the early stages of Solar System
evolution. This could explain the higher fraction
of A-types in the NEO population as compared to
that found in the Main Belt.
• We presented evidence that Ven us encounters play
a role in the process of turning S-complex into Qcomplex asteroids. We also notice that the Q/S ratio is highly correlated with asteroid perihelion distance. This correlation could be due to other physical processes like thermal fatigue which should increase with lower perihelion. However, discontinuities in this ratio are seen around perihelia equal
to Earth and Venus, suggesting multiple processes
may be at play.
