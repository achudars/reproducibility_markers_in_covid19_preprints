Abstract
The predictability of the atmosphere at short and long time scales, associated with the
coupling to the ocean, is explored in a new version of the Modular Arbitrary-Order OceanAtmosphere Model (MAOOAM), based on a 2-layer quasi-geostrophic atmosphere and a 1-layer
reduced-gravity quasi-geostrophic ocean. This version features a new ocean basin geometry
with periodic boundary conditions in the zonal direction. The analysis presented in this paper
considers a low-order version of the model with 40 dynamical variables.
First the increase of surface friction (and the associated heat flux) with the ocean can
either induce chaos when the aspect ratio between the meridional and zonal directions of the
domain of integration is small, or suppress chaos when it is large. This reflects the potentially
counter-intuitive role that the ocean can play in the coupled dynamics.
Second, and perhaps more importantly, the emergence of long-term predictability within the
atmosphere for specific values of the friction coefficient occurs through intermittent excursions
in the vicinity of a (long-period) unstable periodic solution. Once close to this solution the
system is predictable for long times, i.e. a few years. The intermittent transition close to this
orbit is, however, erratic and probably hard to predict.
This new route to long-term predictability contrasts with the one found in the closed oceanbasin low-order version of MAOOAM, in which the chaotic solution is permanently wandering
in the vicinity of an unstable periodic orbit for specific values of the friction coefficient. The
model solution is thus at any time influenced by the unstable periodic orbit and inherits from
its long-term predictability.

Introduction

Nowadays important efforts are devoted to the development of forecasting systems for long lead
times from seasons to decades. Just like numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems, these
forecasts are subject to the property of sensitivity to initial conditions by which a small initial error
will rapidly amplify until it reaches a level at which no useful information can be extracted anymore.
This level is usually fixed at the point where the mean square error score reaches twice the variance
of the climatology of the observable (Lorenz, 1982; Dalcher and Kalnay, 1987; Chen, 1989; Boer,
∗ svn@meteo.be

1

1994; Savijarvi, 1995). This specific level marks the time at which, on average, no correlation exists
between the forecast and the observations anymore. So the way the mean square error reaches this
level as a function of time is a key feature revealing the potential of extended-range forecasts.
This feature was already recognized by Lorenz (1982) who estimated the limit of predictability of
weather systems at mid-latitudes to 10-15 days using a state-of-the-art weather forecasting system
(at that time). Similar estimates have been obtained later in more sophisticated NWP models which
only describe the evolution of the atmosphere (Dalcher and Kalnay, 1987; Chen, 1989; Kalnay,
2003). Nowadays, the tendency is to develop Earth System Dynamic (ESD) models encompassing
different components of the climate system. The hope is that the mutual interaction between these
different components will allow to extend the predictability limit of the atmosphere beyond the
10-15 days barrier.
Interactions between the different components of the climate system are essential to its behaviour
on multiple time scales. A particular example is the dynamics of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation
(ENSO) phenomenon for which the ocean interacts with the atmosphere in the tropical Pacific,
leading to the development of a coupled dynamics with a low-frequency variability developing in
the atmosphere on time scales of a few years, e.g. (Philander, 1990; Stuecker et al., 2013). At
mid-latitudes, such ocean-atmosphere interactions are less pronounced and the origin of the lowfrequency variability is still a matter of debate (Robertson et al., 2000; Marshall et al., 2001). Some
coupled modes have however been found in coupled ocean-atmosphere models or in observational
data (Czaja and Frankignoul, 2002; Van der Avoird et al., 2002; Kravtsov et al., 2007; Feliks et al.,
2007; Minobe et al., 2008; Brachet et al., 2012; L’Hévéder et al., 2015; Vannitsem and Ghil, 2017).
This suggests that low-frequency variability developing in the atmosphere can be associated with
the coupling to the ocean, and could be a source of long-term predictability.
Recently a simple reduced-order multi-scale system composed of a reduced-gravity quasi-geostrophic ocean layer and a two-layer baroclinic atmosphere has been built to sketch the dynamics
of the coupled ocean-atmosphere system over mid-latitude ocean basins. The fields described by
these equations were developed in Fourier series and severely truncated to a low order, yielding a
system of 36 ordinary differential equations describing the dominant modes of the dynamics (Vannitsem et al., 2015). This system displays a low-frequency variability (LFV) in the atmosphere
provided the friction coefficient between the ocean and the atmosphere is sufficiently high (Vannitsem et al., 2015). The emergence of this low-frequency variability is at the origin of the long-term
predictability of some observable within the atmosphere as illustrated in (Vannitsem, 2017). It is
however important to notice here that in the context of this coupled model, the LFV does not develop when the friction coupling (which also controls the heat fluxes between the two components)
is small. This means that coupling two components, slow and fast, does not imply that the fast
system will inherit the LFV associated with the presence of the slow component. In the model
version of Vannitsem et al. (2015), called VDDG in the following, the development of the LFV and
the long-term predictability in the atmosphere is the outcome of a bifurcation leading to a drastic
qualitative change of dynamics. The solution of the system experiences a catastrophic change when
the friction coefficient is increased, leading to an attractor developing close to an unstable periodic
orbit. We will refer to this transition as a chaos-to-chaos transition. This new solution wanders
chaotically around the unstable periodic orbit, a type of dynamics that has already been isolated
in much simpler systems by e.g. Tél and Gruiz (2006); Wernecke et al. (2017). This chaos-to-chaos
transition has been found in autonomous and non-autonomous versions of the model (Vannitsem,
2015), and in all the experiments that were done with this model configuration (Vannitsem et al.,
2015; Vannitsem, 2015, 2017; Demaeyer and Vannitsem, 2018).

2

One can now wonder whether the presence of this transition is sensitive to changes in the
model, such as an increase in the model resolution or a change in the geometry of the system. This
has motivated the development of a flexible, generalised version of the model called the Modular
Arbitrary-Order Ocean-Atmosphere Model (MAOOAM) (De Cruz et al., 2016). Using MAOOAM,
some preliminary work has been done in answering the first question, by looking at the variability
of the solutions when increasing the number of modes. It was shown that the LFV can weaken at
intermediate resolutions, but recovers as the number of modes is further increased.
This work aims to address the second question by modifying the basin boundary conditions of
the ocean. Instead of using a fully closed ocean basin, periodic boundary conditions are imposed
in the zonal direction of the ocean component. In this situation, both the flow in the ocean and in
the atmosphere develop in a channel.
This new model configuration can be viewed as a very crude representation of the Southern
Ocean encircling Antarctica. However, care should be taken when using the results presented in
the following sections to interpret the dynamical behaviour in the Southern Ocean. Indeed, the
model does not feature a meridional gradient of density in the ocean component, which is composed
of a single homogeneous layer. This gradient is known to be essential in the development of the
Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), (Vallis, 2006). It is nonetheless interesting to investigate
the robustness of the findings obtained in the context of a closed ocean basin in this new model
version. This analysis can provide new ideas in the analysis of the dynamics of a more realistic
Southern Ocean configuration.
In Section 2, the new model version is described. The Lyapunov properties characterizing the
short-term evolution and the long-term saturation of the error within this model are then discussed
in Section 3. The key conclusions are provided in Section 4.

2.1

The new version of the model
Dynamical equations

The dynamical equations of the model have already been described in Vannitsem (2015); De Cruz
et al. (2016). These are briefly repeated here for completeness.
2.1.1

Equations of motion for the atmosphere and the ocean

The atmospheric model is based on the vorticity equations of a two-layer, quasi-geostrophic flow
defined on a β-plane. The equations in pressure coordinates are

here ψa1 and ψa3 are the streamfunction fields at 250 and 750 hPa, respectively, ω = dp/dt is the
vertical velocity, f0 is the Coriolis parameter at latitude φ0 , and β = df /dy the meridional gradient
of f at latitude φ0 .

The coefficients kd and kd0 multiply the surface friction term and the internal friction between
the layers, respectively, while ∆p = 500 hPa is the pressure difference between the two atmospheric
layers. An additional term has been introduced in this system in order to account for the presence
of a surface boundary velocity of the oceanic flow defined by ψo whose evolution is based on the
reduced-gravity, quasi-geostrophic shallow-water model on a β-plane :

curl of the wind stress that will be defined later.
2.1.2

Ocean temperature equation

We assume that temperature is a passive scalar transported by the ocean currents, but the oceanic
temperature field displays strong interactions with the atmospheric temperature through radiative
and heat exchanges. Under these assumptions, the evolution equation for the ocean temperature is
γo (

∂To
+ J(ψo , To )) = −λ(To − Ta ) + ER
∂t

(3)

with
ER = −σB To4 + a σB Ta4 + Ro .

(4)

In Equations (3) and (4) above, ER is the net radiative flux at the ocean surface (positive into
the ocean), Ro is the shortwave radiation entering the ocean, a the emissivity of the atmosphere,
σB the Stefan-Boltzman constant, γo the heat capacity of the ocean, and λ is the heat transfer
coefficient between the ocean and the atmosphere that combines both the latent and sensible heat
fluxes. It is assumed that this combined heat transfer is proportional to the temperature difference
between the atmosphere and the ocean.
2.1.3

Atmospheric temperature equation

The thermodynamic equation for the atmosphere is written as,
γa (

p
∂Ta
+ J(ψa , Ta ) − σω ) = −λ(Ta − To ) + Ea,R
∂t
R

(5)

with
Ea,R = a σB To4 − 2a σB Ta4 + Ra .

(6)

In these two equations, R is the gas constant, and
σ=−

R  ∂Ta
1 
−
p ∂p
ρ a cp

is the static stability, with p the pressure, ρa the air density, and cp the specific heat at constant
pressure; here σ is taken to be constant. Ra (t) represents the portion of the short-wave radiative
input from the sun directly captured by the atmosphere.
4

Note also that, thanks to the hydrostatic relation in pressure coordinates and to the ideal gas
relation p = ρa RTa , the atmospheric temperature Ta can be expressed as Ta = −(p/R)f0 (∂ψa /∂p).
This expression for Ta can then be used to combine Equations (5) and (1), as done when deducing
the quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity equation (e.g. Vallis, 2006).

2.2

Domain of integration and parameter values

In the original model version of MAOOAM, the domain of integration is rectangular, with a closed
ocean basin and a channel flow for the atmosphere (Vannitsem et al., 2015; De Cruz et al., 2016).
Free-slip boundary conditions were chosen along the meridional and longitudinal boundaries of the
ocean basin, while these are free-slip in the meridional direction and periodic in the zonal direction
for the atmosphere. In the new version of the model, the main modification is that we now impose
periodic boundary conditions in the zonal direction in the ocean. This model now represents a
channel flow for both the ocean and the atmosphere.
These boundary conditions are satisfied by using the basis functions that were previously used
for the atmosphere to expand both the atmosphere and the ocean fields. In other words, with the
proper normalization, the basis functions for all fields must be of the following form, following the
nomenclature of Cehelsky and Tung (1987):

P = 1, 2, MP= 1, 2 and H = P
1, 2, implying thatP10 modes will be used
for the four dynamical

fields, ψa = i=1 ψa,i Fi , θa = i=1 θa,i Fi , ψo = i=1 ψo,i Fi and To = i=1 To,i√Fi , where Fi are
simplified notations for the set of modes used. Note that the first mode is F1 = 2 cos(y 0 ) whose
coefficients are denoted as ψa,1 , ψo,1 To,1 . These variables will be analyzed in detail in the next
section.
Let us now estimate the parameters to some realistic values (Vannitsem, 2015). Assuming that
the wind stress follows the linear relation, (τx , τy ) = C(u − U, v − V ) – where (u = −∂ψa /∂y, v =
∂ψa /∂x) are the horizontal components of the geostrophic wind, respectively, and (U, V ) the corresponding components of the geostrophic currents in the ocean – one gets,

Similarly, one can use the Ekman layer theory to relate the coefficient kd in Equation 1 to the
friction coefficient C in pressure coordinates,

Four important parameters will be modified in the current investigation, C, n, h and Co .

2.3

Typical solutions of the model

Let us first briefly qualitatively analyze the solutions generated by the coupled model. Time series
of θa,1 and To,1 for C = 0.016 kg m−2 s−1 , n = 1.7, Co = 350 W m−2 and h = 1000 m, are displayed
in Fig. 1 for about 100,000 days. A first remarkable result is the difference of typical time scale
of variability. For the first mode of temperature in the ocean, a low-frequency variability is visible
on time scales of the order of 10,000 days; while for the first temperature atmospheric mode, θa,1 ,
a high frequency variability on a time scale of days is present together with a low-frequency variability coherent with the ocean temperature evolution. This evolution suggests that the dynamics
within the atmosphere is influenced by the ocean, and should therefore lead to modifications of the
predictability properties of the atmosphere.
In order to further clarify the behaviour of the solutions of the system in this range of values,
several videos have been prepared and are provided as supplementary material (videos S1-S7).
These videos display the solutions generated by the model for h = 1000 m and two values of
n = 1.5 and 1.7, and several values of C. Six different panels are displayed in each video, the
geopotential height difference between two locations in the spatial domain (x0 = 0, y 0 = 3π/4 and
y 0 = π/4), a three-dimensional projection of the attractor of the system for the variables (ψa,1 , ψo,1
To,1 ), and four panels representing the solution in the spatial domain. The spatial view is centered
at the South pole.
Let us focus for the moment on the solutions obtained with n = 1.7. For C = 0.01 kg m−2 s−1
(video S1), the temporal evolution of the geopotential height displays an erratic behaviour without

any visible low-frequency variability. This erratic behaviour is also visible in the three-dimensional
plot. The solutions in space display a rapid erratic dynamics for the atmospheric temperature
(proportional to the baroclinic streamfunction) and barotropic atmospheric streamfunction, while
a much slower evolution is seen for the ocean fields. Interestingly a slow counterclockwise motion
is found for the ocean streamfunction, with a westward Rossby wave-type of motion. Overall the
dynamics of the atmosphere seems to be well independent of the dynamics of the ocean.
Let us now increase the friction coefficient to C = 0.016 kg m−2 s−1 (video S2). In this case, the
dynamics displays an intermittent behaviour with periods of strong variability and periods during
which the dynamics seems frozen. It is particularly spectacular for the atmospheric streamfunction
which seems to be frozen for a while from time to time. In the three-dimensional projection of the
attractor this dynamics is marked by a trajectory (the red dot) exploring high values of ψo,1 and
small values of θo,1 . The trajectory seems to converge to a domain of the state space associated
with a purely periodic motion which is visible in the counterclockwise rotation of the spatial ocean
streamfunction field. For even larger values of C, a similar picture is found as illustrated in the
videos S3 and S4 for C = 0.02 and C = 0.027 kg m−2 s−1 , respectively. In the latter case, the
almost periodic motion is clearly visible alternating with more erratic behaviour, in particular in
the geopotential height. This almost periodic motion has quite a long period of about 10 years for
C = 0.027 kg m−2 s−1 .
These videos illustrate the important role of the ocean in the development of low-frequency
variability within the atmosphere. A first interesting aspect is the fact that the atmosphere does
not ”feel” the ocean if the friction is not large enough (also related to the heat fluxes between the
two components through Equation (12)). When a sufficiently high value of the friction coefficient
C is reached, the solution experiences intermittent excursions toward a situation for which the
dynamics of the atmosphere and the ocean are coherent with each other. These different types of
behaviour for small and large values of C should play a role in the predictability of the atmosphere.
This question will now be addressed by investigating two quantities, the Lyapunov exponents and
the error dynamics.

3

Predictability properties of the model

As illustrated in section 2.3, the solutions of the model can display erratic types of behaviour
reminiscent of the dynamics of chaotic deterministic dynamical systems. The predictability of such
systems is limited in time as a small error in the initial conditions will grow in time until it reaches a
level at which the forecast cannot be distinguished from a random draw of a solution on the attractor
of the system (a draw from the long-term climatology of the system). This property of sensitivity
to initial conditions can be evaluated by computing the Lyapunov exponents and/or by computing
the evolution of the error during the entire period of the forecasts. The first approach assumes
infinitesimal initial errors and is commonly used to characterize the nature of the dynamics such
as stationary, periodic or chaotic solutions. The second approach does not assume that the initial
errors are infinitesimal, which is of course more appropriate when dealing with realistic forecasting
problems. Both will be used here, first to characterize the nature of the solutions, and second to
evaluate the long-term predictability of the flow.

8

3.1

Lyapunov instability of the model

Let us first briefly define these quantities and then look at the exponents obtained in the present
model. More details can be found in e.g. Kuptsov and Parlitz (2012).
3.1.1

Lyapunov exponents

The evolution laws of a dynamical system like the ones presented in Section 2.1 can be written in
the compact form
d~x
= f~(~x, λ)
(13)
dt
where ~x is a vector containing the set of relevant variables ~x = (x1 , ..., xn ). This system of equations
is then integrated in time starting from an initial state, ~x(t0 ) = ~x0 . As the real state ~x0 is never
known with infinite precision in practice, a small error, δ~x0 , will affect the future forecast. This
perturbed initial state generates a new trajectory in phase space. The time-dependent error vector,
that is the displacement vector between the reference trajectory and the perturbed one at a given
time, is denoted δ~x(t). Provided the initial error is small, its evolution is described by a linearized
system of equations,
∂ f~
dδ~x
=
δ~x
(14)
dt
∂~x |~x(t)
whose formal solution is,
δ~x(t) = M(t, ~x(t0 ))δ~x(t0 )

(15)

where the matrix M is referred as the resolvent matrix. In the ergodic theory of deterministic
dynamical systems, the double limit of infinitely small initial errors and infinitely long times, is
usually taken, e.g. Eckmann and Ruelle (1985). In this limit the divergence of initially close states
is determined by the logarithm of the eigenvalues of the matrix (MT M)2(t−t0 ) that are referred to
as the Lyapunov exponents. The full set of Lyapunov exponents of a system is called the Lyapunov
spectrum, which is usually represented in decreasing order. Positive Lyapunov exponents indicate
the presence of a chaotic dynamics, hence displaying sensitivity to initial conditions.
Several numerical techniques have been developed to evaluate these Lyapunov exponents (Parker
and Chua, 1989; Kuptsov and Parlitz, 2012). One of the most popular methods consists in following
the evolution of a set of orthonormal vectors chosen initially at random in the tangent space of
the trajectory ~x(t). This basis is regularly orthonormalized using the standard Gram-Schmidt
method to avoid the alignment of all the vectors along the unstable direction associated to the
largest Lyapunov exponent, and the amplification along these vectors can then be computed. The
logarithm of these amplifications are then computed and rescaled by the time t − t0 , which provides
the set of Lyapunov exponents. This is the approach adopted here.
3.1.2

Results for MAOOAM with a channel ocean

Figure 2 displays the dependence of the first Lyapunov exponent as a function of the friction
coefficient C for Co = 350 and Co = 250 W m−2 with h = 1000 m. Different values of the aspect
ratio, n, are considered in the different panels. Let us start with small values of the aspect ratio in
panel (a) for Co = 350 W m−2 . For very small values of n, the solutions found are periodic, leading
to a first Lyapunov exponent equal to 0. When n is increased, the solutions become chaotic for an
intermediate set of values of the friction coefficient, C. This indicates that the coupling between

9

the ocean and the atmosphere through surface friction can induce a chaotic dynamics, a regime
referred to as ocean-induced chaotic dynamics. For even larger values of n (panel b), the picture
is different, with a decrease of the value of the dominant Lyapunov exponents as a function of the
friction coefficient, suggesting a stabilization of the flow through friction. This feature is similar to
the dependence found for the original VDDG model with n = 1.5 (Vannitsem, 2017). This regime
can be referred to as a ocean-tempered chaotic dynamics. A similar picture is found when the solar
input is reduced to Co = 250 W m−2 as illustrated in panels (c) and (d).
When the depth of the ocean layer is reduced to h = 100 m, shown in Figure 3, a qualitatively
similar picture is found, but with a more complicated dependency structure of the friction coefficient
C. For instance with n = 1.5, alternating windows of chaotic and periodic solutions are present,
which was not visible for h = 1000 m at panels (a) and (c) in Figure 2.
In summary, the contrasting behaviour as a function of n reveals a complicated dependence
of the dynamics of the coupled system with respect to the size of the domain (measured by n)
that can lead to ocean-induced chaos or on the contrary to ocean-tempered chaos when friction is
increased. This remarkable result reveals the important potential role played by the ocean, and
the nontrivial dependence of this role on the resolved dynamics in the ocean. Indeed, increasing
the aspect ratio can also be interpreted as filtering out the large-scale zonal waves in favour of an
enhanced description of smaller-scale phenomena, shown to be important for the ocean (De Cruz
et al., 2018). It is however not clear yet whether this result is robust when the number of modes is
explicitly increased. This question will be addressed in the future.

3.2.1

Error dynamics
Definition of the error

In the previous section, the emphasis was placed on the analysis of the Lyapunov exponents characterizing the short term evolution of small initial errors. This analysis, although very useful when
looking at the emergence of chaos, should however be complemented by the analysis of the error
dynamics when interested in the long-term predictability of the system.
Let us consider a solution of the system in phase space, ~x(t0 ) = ~x0 , at time t0 . Observations of
this system are affected by finite-amplitude initial errors that can be for simplicity be considered
as a Gaussian white noise, ~, and the observed state is then, ~x0 (t0 ) = ~x0 + ~. One can now measure
the error evolution starting from these two initial conditions as
~
E(t)
= ~x0 (t) − ~x(t)

(16)

where ~x0 (t) and ~x(t) are the two trajectories starting from the two initial conditions ~x0 (t0 ) and ~x(t0 )
of the perturbed and unperturbed trajectories. Since the amplification of this error fluctuates on
the inhomogeneous attractor of the system, an average over the attractor is necessary in order to
obtain properties that are independent of the initial state. We do not use the classical norm (L2
norm) but rather the logarithmic norm (Nicolis et al., 1995),
Z
Z
hln Et2 i = d~0 ρ (~0 ) d~x0 ρS (~x0 ) ln [(~x0 (t) − ~x(t)) · (~x0 (t)) − ~x(t))]
(17)
where ρ (~0 )d~0 and d~x0 ρS (~x0 ), are the probability measure of the initial errors and of the initial
conditions on the attractor of the system. This specific norm is chosen on the one hand because
it is closely related to the definition of the Lyapunov exponents, and on the other hand because

it considerably reduces the fluctuations associated with the finite number of realizations used to
compute the mean error. The amplitude of the perturbations ~ is taken sufficiently small in order
to get information of the full error growth evolution, even in the short term regime for which the
error evolution follows a linearized system of equations, used to define the Lyapunov exponents.
The exponential error dynamics expected in this linearized evolution regime translates, after a short
transient evolution, to a linear error amplification in the logarithmic norm defined above. As the
error (17) reaches a substantial amplitude, the effect of the nonlinear terms on the dynamics cannot
be neglected anymore and the rate of amplification of the logarithm of the error starts to decrease,
and for long lead times, saturates due to the finite size of the system’s attractor. This evolution is
discussed in detail in (Nicolis et al., 1995; Vannitsem and Nicolis, 1994; Vannitsem and Lucarini,
2016).
As we are interested in the long-term predictability of the atmosphere in the coupled system, the
focus is placed on how the error defined in (17) saturates for a long lead time. Once this saturation
is reached, no predictability is left in the system anymore, see e.g. (Vannitsem, 2017). In other
words, any random state taken on the attractor of the system will provide a skill score comparable
to the one obtained with a set of initialized forecasts for long times (when reaching the saturation
level).
In (Vannitsem and Lucarini, 2016; Vannitsem, 2017) the dynamics of the error is analyzed for
the VDDG model version and it is shown that provided the friction is sufficiently high, the error
will continue to grow for very long times (up to 100 years) for certain atmospheric variables. As
discussed in the latter references, this remarkable result is associated with the development of
the low-frequency variability (LFV) into the coupled ocean-atmosphere system through a complex
sequence of bifurcations when Co is increased, for a sufficiently large value of C. Beyond this
sequence of bifurcations the attractor of the system develops around an unstable periodic orbit
with a very long period. This orbit constitutes the backbone of the attractor of the system and
controls the long term evolution of the error. Let us now investigate how the error behaves in the
new model version discussed here.
3.2.2

Error evolution in the version of MAOOAM with a channel ocean

Equation 17 is now computed for the version of the model with 40 variables presented in section 2.2,
with 1000 realizations starting from different initial states on the attractor of the system. Figure 4
displays the error evolution for the four fields of the model, namely the barotropic and baroclinic
streamfunctions of the atmosphere, the ocean temperature and the ocean streamfunction, for the
parameters h = 1000 m, Co = 350 W m−2 , n = 1.7. The different curves in each panel correspond
to different values of the friction coefficient C.
For a value of the friction coefficient, C = 0.005 kg m−2 s−1 , the error amplifies rapidly for
the barotropic and baroclinic streamfunctions in the atmosphere, with a saturation level reached
before 0.2 years (Figure 4, panels (a) and (b)). For the ocean fields, the picture is different with
a very stable error until 0.1 year, after which it increases considerably concomitantly to the error
amplification in the atmosphere. This phase is then followed by a slow increases for long lead times
up to more than 20 years (Figure 4, panels (c) and (d)). This slow increase of the error in the ocean
starts when the error in the atmosphere has already reached its saturation level. A similar picture
has been found in the VDDG model version (Vannitsem and Lucarini, 2016; Vannitsem, 2017) for
small friction coefficients, with a limited predictability to about a month in the atmosphere and a
long term predictability in the ocean.

Figure 4: Evolution of the averaged error measured using the logarithmic norm for (a) the atmospheric barotropic streamfunction; (b) the atmospheric baroclinic streamfunction; (c) the ocean
streamfunction; and (d) the ocean temperature. The different curves correspond to different values
of the friction coefficient C. The parameter values used here are h = 1000 m, Co = 350 W m−2 ,
n = 1.7.
When the friction coefficient is increased, the initial error amplification is slower due to the
smaller value of the dominant Lyapunov exponent (Figure 2), explaining the slight shift of the
error growth curve to the right. Besides this shift, the error behaviour in the atmosphere and the
ocean is similar as for C = 0.005 kg m−2 s−1 . The saturation of the error is however substantially
modified when C is further increased. The saturation levels for the atmospheric fields are reached
after about 2 years for C=0.015 kg m−2 s−1 and after about 20 years for C=0.02 kg m−2 s−1 . In
the ocean the error is still increasing after 25 years. This result reveals that the friction coefficient
C plays an important role in the long term predictability of the atmospheric fields.
Several other values of C have been explored as illustrated in Figure 5. In this figure the error
for the barotropic streamfunction fields saturates at larger and larger lead times as a function of
C, for values above C=0.01 kg m−2 s−1 . For C=0.02 kg m−2 s−1 , the error has not reach its
saturation level after about 20 years yet. This feature is reminiscent of the change of long term
predictability experienced in the VDDG model (Vannitsem et al., 2015; Vannitsem and Lucarini,

2016; Vannitsem, 2017) for large values of friction, with a long term predictability associated with
the presence of an unstable periodic orbit around which the attractor is organized. The dynamics
around this unstable periodic orbit however only appears after a chaos-to-chaos transition. This
modification is visible in the abrupt change of the dominant Lyapunov exponents as illustrated
in Figure 10 of (Vannitsem, 2017). One can wonder whether a similar change is experienced in
the present model version. A first remark is that there is no such drastic change of the dominant
Lyapunov exponent in the present model version as shown by the green filled circles in panel (b)
of Figure 2 for n = 1.7, although the variations of the dominant Lyapunov exponent seem larger
when C is increased from 0.01 to 0.02 kg m−2 s−1 .
In order to understand this property, it is necessary to go back to the dynamics described in
Section 2.3. For large values of the friction coefficient C, the solution of the model from time to
time makes an excursion in the vicinity of an unstable periodic orbit, for which the atmosphere is
almost frozen and closely connected with the motion of the ocean. In such a situation the solution
is predictable for quite a long time. In the statistics of the error evolution, this leads to a slow
saturation of the error for long times. This intermittent behaviour lies at the origin of the long-

15

term predictability of the atmosphere illustrated in Figure (5). For small values of C, there is no
excursion close to such a periodic solution, leaving the atmosphere behaving with a high level of
chaoticity.
In order to further elucidate how excursions close to the periodic solution is inducing long-term
predictability, the behaviour of the solutions for several realizations of the error evolution have
been investigated in more details. Figure 6a displays several realizations of the error evolution.
The first one shows a rapid increase of the error which saturates after about 0.2 years, but the
others display saturation only after 0.5 years, 1.5 years, and 2 years. This clearly suggests that in
some circumstances long term predictability is present in the coupled system. If one looks at the
two extreme cases, realizations 1 and 3, at panels (b) and (c) of Figure 6 where the control and
perturbed dynamics of the variable ψa,1 are displayed, one can realize that a very different dynamics
is found. For Realization 1, an oscillating behaviour (but still chaotic) is present suggesting that
the dynamics is partly driven by the existence of an (unstable) periodic orbit. This evolution is
accompanied with a small sensitivity to initial states as reflected by the superposition of the control
and the perturbed solutions for about up to 2 years. Note also that both solutions are still close to
each other along the oscillating pattern up to 5 years, indicating that there is still a good potential
for prediction up to that lead time (this phase is less clear in the error evolution since we used
the logarithm of the error). For realization 3, the picture is very different with much less apparent
oscillations, and much less concordance between the two trajectories. In the latter case, the long
term predictability is very low.
Finally it is interesting to see on which part of the attractor these two realizations are located.
Figure 6d shows the 3-dimensional projection of the solutions on which the two realisations 1 and 3
of the error evolution are based. These are well separated in state space, with realisation 3 spanning
the lower right part of the projected attractor. This lower part has been identified in the video S2
as the region where the periodic orbit should lie.
So it clearly appears that the long term predictability of the solutions is associated with the
intermittent excursions of the trajectories in the vicinity of an unstable periodic orbit. As illustrated
in video S2, these excursions occur apparently irregularly suggesting intermittent transitions in the
vicinity of the unstable periodic orbit. This contrasts with the much more regular wandering
behaviour around the unstable periodic orbit found in the context of the VDDG model.
Let us now turn to the ocean-friction induced chaos as found with n = 1.5. Figure 7 displays
the error evolution for different values of C. For C in the chaotic regime, a similar evolution as
for n = 1.7 is found, with a rapid initial amplification and then a saturation phase. For most of
the cases explored, the saturation level is only reach at very long lead times, the only case with a
short predictability period (still beyond a year) is the one for C = 0.012 kg m−2 s−1 . To interpret
this long term predictability, let us figure out what kind of dynamics is taking place by looking
at the different videos made with n = 1.5 (videos S5-S7). As for n = 1.7, the solutions behave
chaotically with intermittent excursions close to a periodic solution with a long period, leading to
a slow saturation of the error for long lead times.
A similar analysis of the error evolution is conducted for another depth of the ocean layer,
h = 100 m (Figures 8-9). In this situation, the evolution of the error in the atmosphere does not
display any long term predictability, except for n = 1.5 and C = 0.005 kg m−2 s−1 . The intermittent
behaviour found for h = 1000 m does not emerge from the dynamics anymore. This contrasting
behaviour suggests that the conditions for getting long term predictability are not always met and
even when a strong coupling (large friction and large heat transfer between the components of the
system) exists, the predictability is still limited to the typical time scale associated with the inverse

of the dominant Lyapunov exponent.
In summary, the emergence of long term predictability in the present model version considerably
differs from the behaviour found in the closed basin version of the model (Vannitsem et al., 2015;
Vannitsem, 2015, 2017). In the latter work as already mentioned, a chaos-to-chaos bifurcation was
identified leading to the development of a chaotic attractor around an unstable periodic orbit at
the origin of a low-frequency variability. The solutions are then wandering around the unstable
periodic orbit in a similar way as in simpler systems (Tél and Gruiz, 2006; Wernecke et al., 2017).
In the present system, an unstable periodic orbit is also involved, but the solution of the system
is only experiencing intermittent excursions in the vicinity of this orbit. These excursions also last
longer when the value of C is increased.

Conclusions

A new geometry for the integration of the coupled ocean-atmosphere model, MAOOAM, has been
implemented with a channel flow for both the atmosphere and the ocean (periodic boundary conditions in the zonal direction for both model components). This new model version mimics the
conditions that could be present around Antarctica. The predictability properties that may arise
from the interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere are explored based on both the computation of the Lyapunov exponents and the long-term convergence of the mean square error toward
a plateau, signature of the loss of predictability.
A first important result is that the interaction with the ocean can either induce chaos when the
aspect ratio between the meridional and zonal length scales is small, or suppress chaos when the
aspect ratio is large. This feature has been found to be robust to modifications of the depth of the
ocean and the radiative input into the system. The ocean-induced chaotic regime may however be
simply an artifact of the truncation of the spatial fields to their low-order versions, here limited to
10 Fourier modes.
A second remarkable result of the analysis is that long-term predictability as measured by the
mean square error evolution is not a robust feature emerging from the coupling, as it was the
case in the coupled ocean-atmosphere model with closed boundaries for the ocean (Vannitsem
et al., 2015; Vannitsem, 2015, 2017). To have long term predictability (in the mean), some specific
parameter values (the depth of the ocean, the friction coefficient) should be set in such a way that the
solution of the model operates intermittent excursions in the vicinity of an unstable periodic orbit.
This clearly demonstrates that emergence of low-frequency variability and the associated long-term
predictability is not straightforwardly linked to the coupling between the different components of
the climate system. For the interaction with the ocean as discussed here, this emergence clearly
depends on the basin geometry in reduced-order models like MAOOAM.
Higher-resolution model versions should be explored in order to get confidence in these results.
A preliminary analysis with model versions of higher dimensions with up to 312 variables, half for
the atmosphere and half for the ocean, has been performed. Figure 10 illustrates the results for
h = 1000 m, Co = 350 W m−2 , n=1.7, and different values of C arbitrarily taken. When C is
small, a highly erratic behaviour is found, while for larger values of C the behaviour displays strong
similarities with the dynamics at lower resolutions shown in Figure 1, with an erratic decrease of
the dominant ocean temperature mode close to 0 (see panel (c)). This suggests that the dynamics
found for the reduced-order model is a generic dynamics that can be found at higher resolutions.
The mechanism behind this dynamics is therefore worth investigating in more realistic models like
the one developed by Hogg et al. (2003) and also in realistic climate models.
The present open-channel ocean model has a horizontal geometry with some similarities with the
open-channel structure of the Southern Ocean. However the homogeneous vertical and horizontal
structure of the model is far from being appropriate to describe the Southern ocean since strong
horizontal variations of the density are present inducing the development of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), (Vallis, 2006). The model is thus not able to describe the ACC appropriately.
One can therefore wonder whether our analysis is relevant for the actual Southern Ocean. This can
be addressed by modifying the ocean dynamics allowing for horizontal gradient of densities and the
development of convective instabilities. This analysis is planned in the future along the lines of the
ocean modelling approach of Hogg et al. (2003) for instance.
Finally, in the VDDG and the current model versions, the long-term predictability is associated
with the presence of an unstable periodic orbit whose origin can be traced back to the interaction

between the ocean and the atmosphere. This long-term predictability mechanism was already
discovered in much simpler ”single scale” systems (Tél and Gruiz, 2006; Gros, 2015; Wernecke
et al., 2017) and the dynamics developing in this context is referred to as partially predictable
chaos. Our results are reminiscent of this mechanism but here in a multiscale system with very
long periods of motion along the unstable periodic orbits. The current results, however, point
toward the possibility of having different routes to long-term predictability. A first one has been
obtained in (Vannitsem et al., 2015; Vannitsem, 2015, 2017) for the closed ocean basin model with
a wandering along the unstable periodic orbit, and second as in the present model configuration, an
intermittent transition from a highly chaotic attracting set to the vicinity of an unstable periodic
orbit. In the latter case, only some forecasts inherit of the long-term predictability properties and
the difficulty is to know when this transition will occur. Finding precursors of this transition is
essential in order to assess the potential predictability of such forecasts, like for instance when
searching for precursors of atmospheric blocking (Vautard, 1990; Matsueda and Palmer, 2018) or
the precursors of specific ENSO events (Duan et al., 2004).
