ABSTRACT

We study the properties of rotating accretion flows onto supermassive black holes
(SMBHs) using axisymmetric two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with radiative cooling and BH feedback. The simulations resolve the accretion dynamics of
gas outside from the BH influence radius through an inner accretion disk. For lower
Bondi accretion rates in units of the Eddington rate (ṀB  10−3 ṀEdd ), the BH
feeding is suppressed due to turbulent motion by several orders of magnitude from
the Bondi rate with outflows to the Bondi radius nearly balancing inflows. Thus, the
radiative luminosity results in as low as ∼ 10−10 − 10−7 LEdd , where LEdd is the
−3
Eddington luminosity. For higher rates of ṀB >
∼ 10 ṀEdd , the optically-thin accreting gas cools via free-free emission and forms a geometrically-thin disk, which feeds
−3
the BH efficiently and increases the radiative luminosity to >
∼ 10 LEdd . The transitional behavior of accreting BHs in galactic nuclei from radiatively inefficient phases
to cold disk accretion naturally explains (1) the reason for the offset between the observed luminosities and theoretical predictions for nearby quiescent SMBHs, and (2)
the conditions to fuel gas into the nuclear SMBH. In addition, the cold disk formed in
galactic nuclei tends to be gravitationally unstable and leads to star formation when
−2
−1
the Bondi rate is as high as ṀB >
∼ 10 M yr . This is a plausible explanation of
the correlation observed between star formation rates and BH feeding rates in Seyfert
galaxies.

INTRODUCTION

Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are almost ubiquitously
harbored at the centers of massive nearby galaxies. The existence of SMBHs is consistent with the number and energetics of high-redshift bright quasars (QSOs), which are associated with efficient gas accretion onto SMBHs (Soltan 1982;
Yu & Tremaine 2002). Through BH feeding and feedback
processes, SMBHs are believed to coevolve with their host
galaxies over the cosmic time (e.g., Kormendy & Ho 2013,
and references therein). In the local universe, however only
a few percent of SMBHs are observed as luminous active
galactic nuclei (AGN). A majority of them are nearly quiescent and known as low luminosity AGN (Ho 2008, 2009),
or they may be undetectably faint.

c 0000 The Authors

While low-luminosity AGN are energetically unimpressive, the study of such AGN phenomena brings us important
insights and intriguing questions regarding the physics of BH
accretion. One of the puzzles is that nearby, silent SMBHs
exhibit levels of activities much lower than that expected
from gas supplying rates onto the galactic nuclei (e.g., Pellegrini 2005; Ho 2008, 2009). This luminosity deficit problem clearly suggests the lack of our understanding on how
accreting gas finally reaches to the central SMBHs. Simultaneously, we need to address how such quiescent SMBHs
turn into active phases, and how their host galaxies control
the cycle of the two phases.
The basic physics of the accretion process was first studied for a spherically symmetric flow onto a BH with a mass
of M• without radiative effects (Bondi & Hoyle 1944; Bondi
1952). This approach remains a good approximation only if
rotation is so minor as to allow quasi-spherical accretion all
the way down to the BH from the so-called Bondi radius

where c is the speed of light. This means that the inflowing gas must always fall to a rotating (thin or thick) disk
before reaching the BH, and subsequently its mass transport inwards is determined by the physical processes that
transport the angular momentum outwards (Lynden-Bell &
Pringle 1974; Pringle 1981).
At sufficiently low accretion rates, the infalling matter is not dense enough to cool. Thus, the flow is essentially adiabatic, and then there would be no net accretion in
the absence of viscosity. However, magneto-hydrodynamical
(MHD) simulations have shown that even small entrained
magnetic fields will induce the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) in a sufficiently ionized disk (Balbus & Hawley
1991; Matsumoto & Tajima 1995; Stone et al. 1996; Balbus
& Hawley 1998; Stone & Pringle 2001; Hawley et al. 2001;
Machida et al. 2001; McKinney & Gammie 2004; Ohsuga
et al. 2009; Bai 2011; Narayan et al. 2012; Suzuki & Inutsuka 2014). MRI-driven turbulence causes an effective shear
viscosity which permits further inflows and is often described
with the α-viscosity prescription (e.g., Shakura & Sunyaev
1973). In this very low accretion rate domain, several papers
have shown that rotating accretion flows become convectively unstable and have been termed convection dominated
accretion flows (CDAFs; Igumenshchev & Abramowicz 1999;
Stone et al. 1999; Narayan et al. 2000; Quataert & Gruzinov
2000; Igumenshchev & Abramowicz 2000).
Although other solutions of hot accretion flows have
been proposed by many authors for different boundary conditions (e.g., Ichimaru 1977; Narayan & Yi 1994, 1995;
Blandford & Begelman 1999, 2004), accreting matter captured by the BH gravity through the Bondi radius preferentially settles down to a CDAF within the centrifugal radius
(Inayoshi et al. 2018, Paper I). In the CDAF solution, convective flows form a geometrically-thick disk, and the inflow
rate decreases toward the center as Ṁin ∝ r within the disk.
Physically, the reason for this is that the flow is not strongly
bound to the central BH in the absence of cooling, so that
at each radius gravitational energy release is sufficient to
reverse the flow of some material and consequently to reduce the net accretion rate. As a result, the net accretion
rate onto the central BH is extremely small compared to the
rate measured at the Bondi radius. As shown in a schematic
overview in Fig. 1, the solution describes the situation in the
majority of the locally observed BHs such as the ones in the

the gas inflow rates (i.e., the Bondi accretion rates). Both values
are normalized by the Eddington luminosity and accretion rate.
For lower rates at ṀB /ṀEdd < 10−3 (∼ ṁcool ), the accreting
gas behaves adiabatically and forms a geometrically-thick disk.
As a result, matter is convectively unstable and the BH accretion
rate is well below the Bondi rate (Ṁ•  ṀB ), and the radiative

The pink band encloses the CDAF solutions which explain nearby

∼ ṁcool , the gas cools and
forms a geometrically-thin disk. The BH accretion rate increases
by several orders of magnitude and reaches the Bondi rate (Ṁ• '
ṀB ), which causes a sharp rise of the radiative luminosity. The
cold accretion disk is likely to be unstable by its self-gravity (Q ∼
1), fragment into small clumps and triggers star bursts.

2018), illustrated by the pink band in Fig. 1.
Now, let us consider higher density environments which
could be occasioned either by cooling flows within galaxies
(e.g., Ciotti & Ostriker 2001; Dekel & Birnboim 2006; Gaspari et al. 2013, 2015; Gan et al. 2018) or galaxy mergers
(e.g., Sanders et al. 1988; Juneau et al. 2009; Hopkins &
Quataert 2010). At some critical density, the rotating disk
cools and collapses to a thin disc and then, as we shall see,
in most cases the disks are locally unstable to the gravitational instabilities (Toomre 1964; Gammie 2001). Then
spiral modes develop and provide the angular momentum
and mass transport (e.g., Thompson et al. 2005; Rice et al.
2005; Lodato & Natarajan 2006; Hopkins & Quataert 2010;
Kuiper et al. 2011; Meyer et al. 2017; Gan et al. 2018). There
is both observational and theoretical evidence for massive
star formation to occur within the gravitationally unstable
disks (Goodman 2003; Levin & Beloborodov 2003; Levin
2007; Nayakshin et al. 2007).
In this paper, we aim to pinpoint just where and when
accretion onto BHs can change drastically from almost being
unobservably faint to emitting more than a billion times the
solar luminosity. For this purpose, we perform axisymmetric
two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations including a variety of physical processes, e.g., radiative cooling and feedback associated with BH accretion. We investigate the gas
dynamics of accretion in the cooling transition and elucidate
MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

3
the characteristics of the flow in the gravitationally unstable
domain. It occurs at the level where the accretion rate from
the Bondi radius is ṁcool ∼ O(10−3 ) measured in units of
the Eddington accretion rate (see the yellow shaded region
in Fig. 1). There is another flow boundary at still higher
inflow rates of ṁfb ∼ O(10−2 ), where the radiative feedback from the central BH, i.e., gas heating at larger scales
around RB , causes the flow to reverse and become intermittent. This critical accretion rate has also been investigated
by many authors (Ciotti & Ostriker 2001; Proga 2007; Ciotti
et al. 2009; Milosavljević et al. 2009; Park & Ricotti 2011;
Novak et al. 2011; Choi et al. 2014; Inayoshi et al. 2016) that
basically focused on the feedback effect on the gas dynamics
at r <
∼ RB or even larger galactic scales ∼ O(kpc). At even
higher accretion rates of ṁ >
∼ 1, emergent photons are efficiently trapped within optically thick accretion flows (e.g.,
Ohsuga et al. 2005; Jiang et al. 2014; Sa̧dowski et al. 2015),
and thus radiative feedback hardly affects gas supplied from
the Bondi scales when the rate is as high as ṁ ∼ O(103 )
(Inayoshi et al. 2016; Takeo et al. 2018, 2019). We do not
reach those levels of accretion in this work, but will study
the feedback self-consistently coupled with the dynamics of
the accretion disk in future work.
We here focus on the accretion dynamics at larger scales
covering the Bondi radii, unlike previous work that has investigated the accretion flows at smaller scales assuming a
compact torus in hydrostatic equilibrium as the initial state.
This basic spirit of our simulations allows us to consider
plausible initial and boundary conditions, some of which can
be directly measured in the nuclear regions surrounding quiescent SMBHs. As shown in Fig. 1, we are also able to test
our theoretical model compared to the energy output (e.g.,
radiative luminosity) associated with actual BH feeding at
the centers of nearby galaxies.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In §2, we
describe the methodology of our numerical simulations. In
§3, we show our simulation results and explain their physical
properties. In §4.1, we discuss the conditions for the transition from the radiatively inefficient, hot, torus-like accretion domain to radiatively efficient, cold, thin disk accretion
domain. In §4.2, we discuss the possibility of gravitational
instability of the disk and the properties of marginally unstable disk structure. In §4.3, we describe the relation between the Bondi accretion rates and radiative luminosities
and explain the reason for the luminosity deficit of SMBHs
in the local Universe. Moreover, in §4.4 we argue the AGNstarburst connection, i.e., the relation between BH feeding
rates and star formation rates in the circumnuclear regions.
Finally, we summarize our main conclusions in §5.

METHODOLOGY
Basic equations

We solve the axisymmetric two-dimensional hydrodynamical
equations using the open source code PLUTO (Mignone et al.
2007) with modifications described in Kuiper et al. (2010,
2011). The basic equations are following: the equation of
continuity,

and the equation of motion,
dv
= −∇p − ρ∇Φ + ∇ · σ + frad er ,
(5)
dt
where ρ is the density, v is the velocity, and p is the gas
pressure, the gravitational potential is set to Φ = −GM• /r,
r is the distance from the central BH, σ is the stress tensor
due to viscosity, and frad is the outward net radiation force
in the radial direction. The time derivative is the Lagrangian
derivative, given by d/dt ≡ ∂/∂t + v·∇.
We solve the energy equation of
ρ

de
= −p∇ · v + (σ · ∇)v − Λ + Γ,
(6)
dt
where e is the internal energy per mass. The equation of
state of the ideal gas is assumed as p = (γ − 1)ρe, where
γ = 5/3. The first and second terms on the right-hand-side
present compressional heating (or expansion cooling) and
viscous heating. The last two terms are radiative cooling
and heating (in units of erg s−1 cm−3 ).

where the strength of viscosity is set to α0 = 0.01 according
to MHD simulations of the global disk structure (e.g., Zhu
& Stone 2018; Takasao et al. 2018), and ρcr is a threshold
of the density above which viscosity turns on. We adopt a
maximum value of the density at an initial condition as the
threshold value (see §2.2). Under this model, the viscous process is active primarily in an accretion disk (r <
∼ RC ), where
the rotational velocity has a significant fraction of the Keplerian velocity. On the other hand, angular momentum transported from the disk would be accumulated outside it, where
no viscous processes operate. Such rotating flows with negative gradients of the specific angular momentum outward,
i.e., ∂j/∂r < 0, are unstable and become turbulent, leading
to angular momentum transport in three-dimensional (3D)
simulations (Chandrasekhar 1961). Since our simulations do
not capture this 3D effect, instead we add the second term
in Eq. (9) so that a steady state of the accretion flow exists.
We note that the treatment of the rotational instability does
not affect our results (see Appendix in Inayoshi et al. 2018).
In our simulations, radiative processes are taken into
account in what follows. The radiative heating and cooling
terms are expressed as
Γ − Λ = n2 (Sbr + SComp + Sph ),

(10)

where each term corresponds to the rate associated with
bremsstrahlung cooling (Sbr ), Compton heating/cooling
(SComp ), and the sum of photoionization heating, line and

4
recombination continuum cooling (Sph ). The Compton heating/cooling rate is given by
kB (TC − T ) σes Lbol

(11)

where Lbol is the AGN bolometric luminosity, TC is the
Compton temperature, n is the number density of electron,
kB is the Boltzmann constant, me is the electron mass, c
is the speed of light, and σes is the cross section of electron scattering. We adopt TC = 108 K as our fiducial value
for observed low-luminosity AGN (Xie, Yuan & Ho 2017).
Note that Compton temperature for low-luminosity AGN
(LX /LEdd < 10−3 ) is higher than that estimated in previous works using composite spectra of high luminosity AGNs;
TC ' 2 × 107 K (Sazonov et al. 2004). The functional forms
of Sbr and Sph are given in Sazonov et al. (2005). In this
paper, we consider situations where accretion flows are optically thin. Therefore, the outward radiation force term in
equation of motion can be expressed by

radiative efficiency model we adopt (blue solid curve), which
consists of the following two models. The radiative efficiency
at a higher rate of ṁ > 10−4 is obtained by a semi-analytical
model (green dashed curve; Xie & Yuan 2012). For lower
rates of ṁ ≤ 10−4 , the fitted values are based on the result of
general relativity and radiation transfer simulations (orange
squares; see Table 1 in Ryan et al. 2017), where gas accretion
onto a Kerr BH with a spin of a• = 0.5 has been studied.
Our model for the radiative efficiency is significantly higher
than that for an ADAF-like model (e.g., Ciotti et al. 2009,
red dotted), which is often used in previous work, but does
not take into account energy transfer by Coulomb collision
between ions and electrons properly.

Boundary and initial conditions

To compute the basic equations, we employ spherical coordinates in a computational domain of rin ≤ r ≤ rout
and  ≤ θ ≤ π − , where  is set to 0.01 to avoid numerical singularity at poles. In the radial direction, we set
up logarithmically-spaced grids, the number of which is
Nr = 512. In the polar direction, we use static refinement
in order to resolve the scale height of a cold disk, setting
two types of uniformly spaced grids; ∆θ = 3(π − 2θ0 )/Nθ at
θ0 ≤ θ ≤ π − θ0 (near the mid-plane) and ∆θ = 3(θ0 − )/Nθ
otherwise (near the poles). We set Nθ = 384 (= 128 × 3)
and θ0 = 1.3 so that the disk scale height is sufficiently resolved. As our fiducial case, we set rin = 1.7 × 10−2 RB

In other words, a high-density region with ρ > ρcr must be

Fig. 3, the density distribution of the equilibrium torus for
β = 0.1 is shown.
Although we employ static mesh refinement near the
equatorial region, a disk scale height cannot be resolved well
if the gas temperature drops below ∼ 0.01 T∞ , where T∞
is the temperature of the ambient gas. In order to avoid
MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

5
this issue, we set a minimum temperature below which radiative cooling turns off, i.e., Λ(T ≤ Tmin ) = 0. We adopt
Tmin = 0.1 T∞ as our fiducial value and study two cases
with Tmin = 0.2 T∞ and 0.05 T∞ . As discussed in §4.2, the
Toomre parameter depends on the choice of Tmin somewhat
sensitively. We will conduct an extrapolation of our results
for lower values of Tmin ∼ 104 K (' 10−3 T∞ ) and construct
the global structure of the accretion disk.
We adopt the outflow boundary condition at the innermost/outermost grid zones from Stone & Norman (1992),
where zero gradients cross the boundary are imposed on
physical quantities in order to avoid spurious reflection of
wave energy at the boundary. In addition, we impose vr ≤ 0
at the inner boundary (i.e., inflowing gas from ghost cells
is prohibited). At the poles, the reflective condition is imposed on the circumferential component of the velocity vθ .
After the transition to a cold disk, we assume an isothermal
Keplerian disk in the inner ghost grids at θ = θcold , where
T (rin , θcold ) ≤ 1.2 Tmin 1 ; in practice, the rotational velocity
is set to vφ (r < rin , θcold ) = vKep [1 − (5/2)(H/r)2 ]1/2 .

Basic quantities and parameter choices

Before we discuss the simulation results, we introduce a dimensionless physical quantity which characterizes BH accretion systems. As a reference of the accretion rate, we define

In this work, we set the BH mass to M• = 108 M ,
the temperature of the ambient gas to T∞ = 107 K (c∞ =
470 km s−1 ) at the initial state and β = 0.1 and α0 = 0.01
as our fiducial case. We study the effects of radiative cooling
and heating, varying the gas density ρ∞ and thus ṁB .

increases even after a few dynamical timescales and ultimately reaches the Bondi rate for isothermal gas (γ = 1),
which is e3/2 (' 4.5) times higher than the Bondi rate for
γ = 5/3 (note that for the case with ṁB = 1.2 × 10−3 , a
steady state is realized at t >
∼ 230 tdyn ). This result clearly
shows that radiative cooling boosts the normalized accretion rate by three orders of magnitude. As a result, the radiative luminosity from the nuclear regions is also enhanced
by many orders of magnitude, L/LEdd ' 6.3 × 10−3 (see
discussion in §4.3).
Fig. 5 presents the radial structure of the angleintegrated mass inflow (dashed) and net accretion (solid)

that in CDAFs (p ' 1). This fact indicates that convective
motion driven by viscous heating suppresses the gas inflow
(e.g., Narayan et al. 2000; Quataert & Gruzinov 2000, see
also Inayoshi et al. 2018 for details). The net accretion rates
are almost constant at ∼ 0.02 ṀB within the Bondi radius.
For the highest-density case (ṁB ' 4 × 10−3 ), the inflow
rate becomes comparable to the net accretion rate within
the centrifugal radius. As shown in Fig 4, the net accretion
rate, normalized by the Bondi rate for γ = 5/3, is two orders
of magnitude higher than those in the lower-density cases.
The radial dependence of the inflow rate becomes flatter
(p ∼ 0.3) because convective motion ceases due to efficient
radiative cooling.

times correspond to those when the accretion flows are in steady
states (t = 160 tdyn ). For lower-density cases, the inflow rates
decrease toward the center, following Ṁin ∝ r (black dotted line).
The net accretion rates become a constant value of ' 0.02 ṀB

accretion rate is almost comparable to the inflow rate and depends
on the radius weakly (Ṁin ∝ rp ; p ' 0.3 at r < RB ).

plotted in the temperature distribution. At the early stage
of t <
∼ 10 tdyn (left panel), the accretion flow is highly turbulent (but subsonic) and forms a geometrically-thick torus
inside the Bondi radius. Since the accreting gas is still adiabatic, the structure of the accretion flow is similar to that of
a CDAF. We note that 3D simulations of non-axisymmetric
accretion flows performed by Igumenshchev et al. (2000)
suggest that the results are essentially similar to those obtained in 2D simulations, and the turbulent eddies are nearly
axisymmetric and transport angular momentum inwards.
This allows us to justify that our 2D simulations can capture
the essential physics. At the late stage of t >
∼ 10 tdyn (right
panel), the accreting gas begins to cool, collapse towards
the equator and forms a geometrically-thin disk. The disk
increases its mass via gas supply from the Bondi radius, and
feeds the central BH with the aid of viscous processes transporting the angular momentum outwards. Since radiative
cooling is inefficient above the disk, the cold disk is embedded in hot gas (T  T∞ ). As shown in Fig 4, the accretion
flow settles into a steady state at t >
∼ 100 tdyn , where the
BH accretion rate is as high as ' 0.02 ṀEdd . In the steady
state, the radiative luminosity from the BH (r < rin ) is on
the order of ∼ 0.01 LEdd . The combination of heating and
outward momentum caused by radiation produces weak outflows at r <

the Bondi radius with a velocity of vr ' 2 c∞ , but the mass
outflow does not reduce the BH accretion rate significantly.

speed at the Bondi radius, a large fraction of the outflowing

BH and accrete onto the disk (middle). Outflows in the bipolar
directions are produced by energy release from the disk and BH.

Such a burst of gas accretion increases the energy output
from the disk (viscous dissipation) and BH (radiation). As a
result, mass outflows are launched to the bipolar directions
episodically.
Fig. 8 shows the radial profiles of the gas density (top)
and temperature (bottom) at the mid-plane for ṁB '

circles shown in Fig. 4. At the early stage (red curves, epoch
1), the gas density and temperature follow ρ ∝ r−1/2 and
T ∝ r−1 within the centrifugal radius, respectively. The radial structures are consistent with those of a CDAF solution
(e.g., Quataert & Gruzinov 2000). At the late stages, radiative cooling induces gas collapse onto the mid-plane. This
transition begins to occur around the centrifugal radius (see
green curves, epoch 2), where the cooling condition is satisfied first in the flow (tcool < tth,vis ; see §4.1). After the
transition, the gas density in the disk dramatically increases
to ' 108 ρ∞ at r ' rin , and the disk outer edge moves outwards by angular momentum transport (see epoch 3 − 6).
The gas temperature drops to the threshold value we set
(Tmin = 0.1 T∞ ) via optically-thin cooling. Note that this
transition occurs in an unstable way because the cooling
timescale becomes shorter with decreasing temperature as

PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION
The formation of a cold accretion disk

For lower densities at the Bondi radius (ṀB /ṀEdd  10−3 ),
the accreting gas onto a BH forms a geometrically-thick
torus. Namely, the gas density, temperature and inflow
rate are consistent with those of a CDAF solution: ρ ∝
r−1/2 , T ∝ r−1 and Ṁ ∝ r (e.g., Quataert & Gruzinov

It is worth comparing our results to those obtained in
previous work which investigated the radiative cooling effects in hot and optically-thin accretion flows. Early studies by Yuan (2001, 2003) have discussed the properties
of luminous hot accretion flows (LHAFs) in the inner re2
gion (r <

compressional heating balance with cooling via Coulomb
collisions between ions and electrons. For higher rates of

∼ ṀLHAF ' 1.5 α ṀEdd , hot accretion flows no longer
exist because radiative cooling efficiently carries the energy
away. We note that the critical value of ṀLHAF is two orders
of magnitude higher than the critical rate given by Eq. (23)
assuming α = 0.01. Another qualitative difference is that accreting gas from the Bondi radius begins to cool at the disk
outer radius, while in LHAFs the inner region of the disk
at < 102 RSch collapses via cooling. Wu et al. (2016) have
2
also studied the cooling transition of LHAFs at r <
∼ 10 RSch ,
performing hydrodynamical simulations. They found a critical accretion rate of ṀLHAF ∼ 3αṀEdd , above which cold
and dense clumpy and/or filamentary structures are formed
within hot gas. We note that in their simulations, gas supply
from larger scales is not considered unlike our simulations.

The critical rate would depend on the choice of the outer
edge of the disk. For Rout = 104 RSch , Yuan (2001) obtained

r = RC . Star symbols indicate those shown in Eq. (25).

The different treatment of the outer boundary conditions
would affect the cooling conditions and significantly lower
the critical accretion rate given in Eq. (23).
In this paper, we do not discuss the regime of higher
accretion rate where various feedback processes would be
important, e.g., radiation, winds and jets (e.g., Sazonov
et al. 2005; Ciotti & Ostriker 2001; Proga 2007; Yuan et al.
2009; Ciotti et al. 2009; Booth & Schaye 2009; Milosavljević et al. 2009; Yuan & Li 2011; Novak et al. 2011; Choi

et al. 2018; Yoon et al. 2018; Bu & Yang 2019, and see
Fabian 2012 references therein). We define the critical BH
accretion rate ṁfb , above which a steady state no longer
exists due to feedback but gas accretion occurs episodically. The exact value of ṁfb is still uncertain, depending
on which feedback processes dominate. Instead of discussing
each process, we here adopt a critical radiation luminosity of Lbol /LEdd ' 0.02 as a reference (e.g., McClintock
& Remillard 2006). Since the BH accretion rate through a
cold (isothermal) disk is ∼ e3/2 (' 4.5) times higher than
the Bondi accretion rate estimated with γ = 5/3, the critical value of the Bondi rate is ṁfb,B ≡ ṁfb /e3/2 ' 6.7×10−3 ,
where Lbol (ṁfb ) = 0.02 LEdd (see Fig. 12 and discussion in
§4.3). We leave the study of the strong feedback domain for
future work.

Toomre instability and an extension of the
disk solution towards the BH

We now focus on the intermediate regime of
<
ṁcool <
∼ ṁB ∼ ṁfb,B , where a dense and geometricallythin disk forms due to radiative cooling, but feedback
does not affect the BH accretion. The cold disk may then
fragment into clumps and form stars by a spiral-mode
gravitational instability, which is characterized by the

where Tmin,4 = Tmin /(104 K). Fig. 11 shows the radial profile
of the Toomre parameter for Tmin = 0.1 T∞ (= 106 K) (red
solid curve). In the cold disk region, the Toomre’parameter
is almost constant as a function of radius and has a minimum
value of Q ' 103 at the centrifugal radius (RC = 0.1 RB ).
This result agrees with the analytical estimate shown by
the star symbol (see Eq. 25) within a factor of two. Dashed
curves present the cases for Tmin = 106 K (red), 2 × 106 K
(green) and 5 × 105 K (blue), but with an inner-most radius
of rin = 3.4×10−2 RB , which is twice larger than our fiducial
case (solid). The Toomre values at r = RC decreases for
3/2
lower Tmin , following Q ∝ Tmin . Therefore, we would expect
that once radiative cooling leads to the formation of a cold
disk and the temperature decreases below 104 K, the disk
would become unstable because of its self-gravity.
When the Toomre parameter decreases to ∼ O(1), the
accretion disk becomes gravitationally unstable (Toomre
1964) and induces non-axisymmetric structure like spiral
arms transporting angular momentum outward efficiently
(Gammie 2001; Goodman 2003; Rice et al. 2005; Vorobyov &
Basu 2006; Kratter et al. 2008; Machida et al. 2010; Kuiper
et al. 2011; Zhu et al. 2012; Takahashi et al. 2016). The
strength of gravitational torque is characterized by an effective viscosity of αeff ∼ O(1). To mimic this effect, we
parameterize the effective viscosity as a function of Q in the
following:
αeff = α0 + αmax exp(−QA /B),

(26)

where α0 ' 0.01 is the viscous parameter induced by the
MRI and αmax ∼ 0.1 − 1 is the maximum viscous strength.
Hydrodynamical simulations of a self-gravitating disk suggest that the disk tends to fragment when the strength of
gravitational torque exceeds a critical threshold value of
αmax . The threshold value depends on mass accretion from
an infalling envelope, realistic radiative cooling, and radiative trapping of energy inside clumps (Zhu et al. 2012). In
the context of massive star formation, the critical value for
fragmentation is suggested to be αmax ∼ 0.1 − 1 (e.g., Kratter et al. 2008)4 . Based on those results, we adopt αmax = 1
as a reference value. We also note that the choice of the
two free parameters of (A, B) hardly affects the strength of
gravitational torque (see Appendix A) and thus they are set
to (A, B) = (10, 1). Using Eqs. (25) and (26), we obtain the

(28)

where αeff ≥ 0.03 is adopted as the threshold value. The
minimum temperature is as high as Tmin ' 3000 K, which
is determined by H− continuum radiation. Thus, once radiative cooling leads to the formation of a dense disk in the
8
Bondi radius of a BH with M• >
∼ 10 M , it would turn gravitationally unstable immediately. For less massive BHs with
M• ∼ 107 M , accretion rates as high as ṁfb,B ∼ 10−2 are
required to trigger the onset of gravitational instability.
As a specific example, we briefly discuss the disk structure of the nuclear BH in M87 galaxy (M• = 6.15 × 109 M
and ṁB = 1.34 × 10−3 ; Gebhardt et al. 2011; Russell et al.
2015), which satisfies Eq. (27). Therefore, the nuclear accretion disk within the Bondi radius becomes unstable, leading
to efficient fragmentation and star formation (e.g., Goodman 2003; Tan & Blackman 2005)5 . Since star formation
will consume the disk mass and the newly formed stars also
will heat the disk, the remaining gas can be stabilized, result in Q ∼ 1. In the marginally unstable disk, the surface

the disk mass would be consumed by star formation. Assuming the star formation efficiency ? = 0.01 inferred
from the Kennicut-Schmidt law (Schmidt 1959; Kennicutt
1998; Krumholz & McKee 2005), the total stellar mass is
M? ∼ 106 M and the expected number of supernovae
(SNe) is NSN ' M? /m? ∼ 104 , where m? ∼ 100 M is
the stellar mass required to generate an SN for a Kroupa
initial mass function (Kroupa 2001). Since the total SN energy NSN ESN ' 1055 E51 erg is injected over the lifetime of
massive stars tlife ∼ 20 Myr, thus the kinetic luminosity is
Lkin ' 2 × 1040 erg s−1 . Let us assume that super-bubbles
expand as pressure-driven snowplows with no radiative cooling in their interior. Then, the criterion for “breakout” from
the cold disk is expressed as Lkin  ρa vt3 A, where ρa is
the ambient gas density, vt is the turbulent velocity in the
disk, and A (∼ H 2 ) is the total surface area of the bubbles (Mac Low & McCray 1988; Koo & McKee 1992; Kim
et al. 2017). In this case for M87 (ρa ∼ 10−16 g cm−3 ,
vt ∼ cs ∼ 10 km s−1 and H ∼ 2 × 1017 cm at r ' RC ),
the ratio of the SN kinetic luminosity to that of turbulent
gas is estimated as Lkin /(ρa vt3 A) ∼ 5000  1. This implies
that SN feedback would likely blow the gas away from the
cold disk, making star formation episodes brief.

∼ 10 M fed at ṁB ∼ ṁcool , star formation activities in the nuclear region within the Bondi radius would be ubiquitous (e.g., Tan & Blackman 2005; Gan
et al. 2018). In fact, this hypothesis would explain the following observational features of the M87 system: the existence of a cold disk in the nuclear region and a low level of
star formation. The cold disk, which is traced by Hα emission, has a size of ∼ 20 − 40 pc (e.g., Harms et al. 1994;
Walsh et al. 2013), suggesting that the formation of the
cold disk is triggered by radiative cooling inside the Bondi
radius (∼ 120 pc). The star formation rate for M87 is es−2
timated as SFR <
M yr−1 based on the 70µm
∼ 5 × 10
infrared luminosity (Temi et al. 2009; Calzetti et al. 2010).
The SFR would be considered as the upper limit because
the observed aperture is considerably larger than the Bondi
scales, and there could be a level of contamination from
synchrotron emission associated with the jet for M87. This
rate is consistent with our order-of-magnitude estimate of
−2
−1
SFR <
∼ M? /tlife ' 5 × 10 M yr , implying that a large
fraction of the gas supplied from the Bondi radius is consumed by star formation, namely, SFR/ṀB <
∼ 0.26. Presumably, a significant fraction of other giant ellipticals had experienced short episodes of star formation even after the
galaxies have terminated major episodes of star formation at
z<
∼ 1 (e.g., Thomas et al. 2005; Pérez-González et al. 2008).
At lower redshifts, the number fraction of elliptical galaxies
having ongoing nuclear star bursts, the so-called blue ellipticals, is as small as ' 3 % (Tojeiro et al. 2013). In addition,
most nuclear disks in the centers of nearby ellipticals seem
stable against star formation, i.e., Q > 1 (Boizelle et al.
2017). Thus, the quiescent phases are expected to last the
order of billions of years.

Radiative luminosity vs. Bondi accretion rate

We here estimate the radiation luminosity (Lbol ) produced
from accretion flows and BH feeding rate (Ṁ• ) for a given
< −2
Bondi accretion rate at a range of 10−6 <
∼ ṀB /ṀEdd ∼ 10 .
The results are summarized in Fig. 12.
Below the cooling threshold (ṁB < ṁcool ∼ 10−3 ), the
accretion flows are adiabatic and the gas inflow rate decreases towards the center due to convection as shown in
Fig. 5. In Paper I (Inayoshi et al. 2018), we estimated the
transition radius within which the inflow rate becomes constant because energy transport by thermal conduction would
dominate that by convection. The inferred accretion rate
onto the central BH is

where fc is the conductivity suppression factor because thermal conduction in the directions perpendicular to magnetic
fields can be suppressed. The value of the suppression factor has been discussed by various theoretical arguments
and estimated as fc ∼ 0.1 (e.g., Narayan & Medvedev
2001; Maron et al. 2004). For such low BH feeding rates,
the radiative efficiency decreases with the accretion rate at

which is shown by the red shaded region in Fig. 12. The

if the BH feeding rate is equal to the Bondi accretion rate
(Ṁ• = ṀB ; black dashed), the radiation luminosities are
much higher than that given by Eq. (32).
For higher Bondi rates (ṁB >
∼ ṁcool ), the accretion flow
cools and forms a dense accretion disk where the accretion
rate is almost constant as a function of radius (see Fig. 5).
Because the equation of state of the gas changes from adiabatic to isothermal one, the actual inflow rate becomes comparable to the Bondi rate for isothermal gas and thus we
obtain Ṁ• ' e3/2 ṀB . Therefore, the radiation luminosity
after the transition is estimated as

(Lbol /LEdd ' 10−3 − 10−2 ) is consistent with the observational results for nearby Seyfert galaxies (Koss et al. 2017).
For comparison, we present the observational results of
Sgr A? and BHs in M31 and M87 (blue asterisks in Fig.
12; see also Inayoshi et al. 2018). Those nearby SMBHs are
known as quiescently accreting ones at rates of ṀB /ṀEdd ∼
10−5 − 10−3 . The detailed gas properties in the nuclei are
studied nicely by Chandra X-ray observations resolving the
angular sizes of their Bondi radii (e.g., Baganoff et al.
2003; Garcia et al. 2010; Russell et al. 2015, and references
therein). Our theoretical estimate agrees well with the observational results for Sgr A? and M31, and further explains the
observed luminosity of M87, which is several times higher
than the adiabatic ones (red dashed) because of radiative
cooling.
4.4

Gas accretion from the circumnuclear disk to
the Bondi scale

So far, we have focused on the accretion physics around and
inside the Bondi radius of the central BH, where a small centrifugal radius is set so that RC < RB . We here briefly discuss gas supply to the Bondi scale from a circumnuclear disk
with a size of ∼ 10 − 100 pc (CND; Thompson et al. 2005;
Ballantyne 2008)6 . Since CNDs would be massive reservoirs
of molecular gas outside but very close to the Bondi radius
(e.g., Hicks et al. 2009 and Izumi et al. 2016 for warm and
cold molecular gas, respectively), we naturally expect active
star formation and/or gas feeding to the nuclear SMBH. Interestingly, observations imply that the BH accretion rate
6

This implicitly assumes a larger centrifugal radius. However,
the gas inflow velocity could be a significant fraction of the Keplerian value in a CND because of the Toomre instability and/or turbulence associated with star formation activities (Wada & Norman 2002).

Esquej et al. 2014; Izumi et al. 2016). This could suggest that
star formation activities in CNDs (outside the Bondi scales)
control the amount of gas fueling (e.g., Shlosman et al. 1989;
Goodman 2003; Thompson et al. 2005; Tan & Blackman
2005; Vollmer et al. 2008; Kawakatu & Wada 2008; Chamani
et al. 2017; Gan et al. 2018).
Numerical simulations studying the structure of a CND
(Wada & Norman 2002; Wada et al. 2009) have found that
SNe associated with active star formation lead to turbulence
in a CND and thus the turbulent viscosity efficiently transports angular momentum outward and mass inward. The
turbulent velocity associated with energy injection by SNe
is estimated as7

This equilibrium state would be realized unless super-bubbles
created by SNe break out the disk scale height (cf. discussion
in §4.2). When the break-out timescale is longer than the sound

with typical velocity of vt .

Therefore, star formation activities in the nuclear region in
a CND at a rate of SFR ' 0.1 M yr−1 provide an inflow rate at ∼ 10−2 M yr−1 within the Bondi radius of an
SMBH. For the typical mass of BHs hosted in Seyfert galaxies/AGN (M• ∼ 107 − 108 M ), the Bondi accretion rate is
high enough to form a cold, dense accretion disk, leading to
a high BH feeding rate of Ṁ• ' ṀB and a high luminosity
of Lbol /LEdd ' 10−3 − 10−2 (see also Koss et al. 2017). The
result is consistent with the fact that the BH feeding rate
inferred from the nuclear luminosity tightly correlates with
the SFR in the CND (< 100 pc), i.e., Ṁ• /SFR ∼ O(0.1)
(e.g., Diamond-Stanic & Rieke 2012; Esquej et al. 2014;
Izumi et al. 2016). On the other hand, for higher BH masses
(M•  108 M ), the Bondi rate would not be high enough
to trigger the cooling transition.

Caveats
magnetic fields

In this work, we do not take into account MHD effects explicitly, but adopt the α-viscosity prescription to treat angular momentum transport, mimicking some properties of MRI
turbulence. The properties of radiatively inefficient MHD accretion flows are affected qualitatively and quantitatively by
the initial configuration and boundary conditions for magnetic fields (e.g., Stone & Pringle 2001; Igumenshchev et al.
2003; McKinney et al. 2012; Narayan et al. 2012; Yuan et al.
2012). Assuming that a toroidal magnetic field or multiple
poloidal loops is initially set or injected with accreting matter from the outer boundary, the accretion flow is dominated
by turbulent motion driven by MRI and heating associated
with magnetic reconnection. Through the dissipation process, the strength of the magnetic field is saturated at some
levels where the ratio of the gas pressure to the magnetic
pressure is β ≡ Pgas /Pm ' 102 − 103 . This type of accretion flow is qualitatively similar to the results obtained from
MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

13
hydrodynamical simulations adopting α-viscosity (e.g., Inayoshi et al. 2018).
On the other hand, when a magnetic field with poloidal
topology is dragged inward by accreting matter and accumulated at the vicinity of the BH, the accretion flow behaves
in a very different way. In fact, the flow is less turbulent but
is likely to produce outflows and/or jets associated with the
amplified strong magnetic field. Yuan et al. (2012) studied
the detailed properties of this type of MHD flow and concluded that the flow is more related to the so-called adiabatic inflow-outflow solution (Blandford & Begelman 2004),
where matter can accrete at very low rates due to strong
outflows which carry energy and angular momentum away.
It is also worthy investigating this issue for gas accretion from outside the Bondi radius where the geometry and
binding energy of the injected mass are different from those
studied in previous work. In this case, a more realistic situation is that magnetic fields at larger scales fluctuate with
time due to gas turbulent motion, and then are dragged inward by accreting matter. We leave this to future work (but
note that Igumenshchev & Narayan (2002) briefly discussed
the issue for spherical accretion).
4.5.2

mechanical feedback due to winds

Mechanical feedback due to AGN winds is expected to play
an important role on the evolution of galaxies when the BH
feeding rate is sufficiently low (e.g., Murray et al. 2005; Ostriker et al. 2010; Gaspari et al. 2012; Choi et al. 2015).
Assuming a phenomenological model (Ostriker et al. 2010),
one can estimate an upper bound on the momentum input
by winds as

where Ṁw is the wind mass-loss rate, vw is the wind velocity,
Ṁinf is the mass inflow rate at the inner grid of r = rin , η is
the ratio of the wind mass-loss rate to the BH feeding rate
(Ṁ• ≡ Ṁinf − Ṁw ), and Ṁ• is assumed to be 10% of the
inflow rate, i.e., η = 9. The outflowing material pushes the
accreting gas bound by the BH gravity and could form an
momentum-driven expanding shell. The strength of gravitational force exerting the shell with a mass of Msh at a radius

Z

where mass accretion to the shell from larger scales is neglected.
Let us compare the strength of momentum input and
gravitational force on a mass shell for the two different accretion regimes. For adiabatic cases with ṁB < 10−3 , where the
mass inflow rate is reduced from the Bondi rate due to turbu−2
lent motion as Ṁinf /ṀB <
∼ 10 , the strength of mechanical
−3
feedback is estimated as Ṗw <
∼ 3×10 ṁB LEdd /c. Using the
density profile of a CDAF near the mid-plane (Eq. 21 in Inayoshi et al. 2018), one can estimate the gravitational force
on the shell as |Fgrav | ∼ 6 × 10−2 ṁB (LEdd /c)(r/RC )1/2 and
−3
thus Ṗw /|Fgrav | <
∼ 0.05. Next, for a higher rate of ṁB ∼ 10 ,
where the inflowing rate through a cold disk is comparable to
MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

the Bondi rate without suppression of accretion, the level of
momentum input is boosted up to Ṗw ∼ 3×10−1 ṁB LEdd /c,
but is not strong enough to blow the dense accretion disk
away (i.e., Ṗw /|Fgrav |  1). Therefore, even in this case
where a generous fraction of the inflowing gas is ejected in
a high velocity, mechanical feedback does not affect the gas
dynamics both in CDAF and cold disk accretion cases.
On the other hand, mechanical feedback due to winds
would be likely to blow the gas away near the poles where
the gas density is sufficiently low and weak outflows are produced even without explicitly assuming AGN winds (see Fig.
6). As a natural outcome, biconical outflows with opening
angles of ∼ 30◦ (70◦ ) would be produced from geometrically
thick (thin) disk in lower (higher) accretion-rate regimes. To
explore the nature and origin of outflows both for CDAF and
cold disk accretion solutions is left for future investigations
(but note that Proga et al. 2000 discussed wind production
from the nuclear disk at an accretion rate of ∼ ṀEdd ).

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

We study the properties of rotating accretion flows onto
SMBHs using axisymmetric two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamical simulations with radiative cooling and BH
feedback. The simulations resolve the accretion dynamics
of gas outside the BH influence radius through an inner
accretion disk. For lower Bondi accretion rates at ṀB 
10−3 ṀEdd , the BH feeding is suppressed by several orders of magnitude from the Bondi rate due to turbulent
motion with outflows to the Bondi radius nearly balancing
inflows. Thus, the radiative luminosity results in as low as
−3
∼ 10−10 − 10−7 LEdd . For higher rates of ṀB >
∼ 10 ṀEdd ,
the optically-thin accreting gas cools via free-free emission and forms a geometrically-thin disk, which feeds the
BH efficiently and increases the radiative luminosity to
> 10−3 LEdd .
∼
The transitional behavior of accreting BHs in galactic
nuclei from the radiative inefficient phases to cold disk accretion naturally explains (1) the reason for the offset between
the observed luminosities and the simplest theoretical predictions for nearby quiescent SMBHs, and (2) the conditions
to fuel gas into the nuclear SMBH. In addition, the cold disks
formed in galactic nuclei tend to be gravitationally unstable
and lead to star formation when the Bondi rate is as high
−2
as ṀB >
M yr−1 . This plausibly explains the corre∼ 10
lation between star formation rates and BH feeding rates in
Seyfert galaxies.

APPENDIX A: EFFECTIVE VISCOSITY BY
THE GLOBAL INSTABILITY IN A
GRAVITATIONALLY UNSTABEL DISK
After the transition to a geometrically-thin, cold and dense
accretion disk, the disk is likely to be unstable to its selfgravity, where the Toomre parameter becomes close to unity
(i.e., Q <
∼ 1). In order to capture the Toomre instability, we
adopt a toy model for the effective viscosity in a gravitationally unstable disk as
αeff = α0 + αmax exp(−QA /B),

(A1)

In spite of uncertainties of those parameters, Takahashi
et al. (2013) found that for a wide range of (A, B) this
model for the effective viscosity can reproduce the results of
three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of a circumstellar disk under continuous gas supply from larger scales
(Machida et al. 2010).
In Fig. A1, we show the effective viscosity (top) and
Toomre parameter (bottom) as a function of

−1
ṁB
3/2
ψ ≡ Tmin,4 M8−1
(A2)
10−3
for different combinations of (A, B). For ψ >
∼ 1, the Toomre
parameter is significantly above unity and thus αeff ' α0 (=
0.01). With ψ decreasing (10−2 < ψ < 1), the Toomre parameter is almost constant at Q ' 1 and the effective viscosity increases. At the intermediate region, gravitational
torques could transport mass and angular momentum so
that the disk structure results in a marginally stable state.
For ψ  10−2 , the effective viscosity is saturated at αeff = 1
and the Toomre parameter becomes substantially lower than
unity. Since the disk no longer keeps stable accretion, therefore the disk would be likely to fragment into clumps. We
set the two free parameters to (A, B) = (10, 1) in §4.2.
