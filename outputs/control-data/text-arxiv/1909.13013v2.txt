STANDARD ELEMENTS OF THE LATTICE
OF MONOID VARIETIES
S.V. GUSEV
Abstract. We completely classify all standard elements in the lattice of all
monoid varieties. In particular, we prove that an element of this lattice is
standard if and only if it is neutral.

The article is devoted to investigation of the lattice of varieties of monoids which
will be denoted by MON (when referring to monoid varieties, we consider monoids
as semigroups equipped by an additional 0-ary operation that fixes the identity
element). Until recently, this lattice has been studied very little. However, recently,
the articles [2–6] which are devoted to this subject appeared. In particular, the
study of the special elements of the lattice MON has been started in [3]. In this
paper, we continue to study them.
Let us recall definitions of special elements which will be used below. An element
x of a lattice L is called
neutral if

∀ y, z ∈ L : (x ∨ y) ∧ (y ∨ z) ∧ (z ∨ x)
= (x ∧ y) ∨ (y ∧ z) ∨ (z ∧ x);

standard if

∀ y, z ∈ L :

(x ∨ y) ∧ z = (x ∧ z) ∨ (y ∧ z);

modular if

∀ y, z ∈ L :

y ≤ z → (x ∨ y) ∧ z = (x ∧ z) ∨ y;

lower-modular if

∀ y, z ∈ L :

x ≤ y → x ∨ (y ∧ z) = y ∧ (x ∨ z).

Costandard and upper-modular elements are defined dually to standard and lowermodular elements respectively. It is evident that a neutral element is both standard
and costandard; a standard element is both modular and lower modular; a costandard element is both modular and upper-modular. Some information about special
elements in arbitrary lattices can be found in [1, Section III.2].
The neutral and costandard elements of the lattice MON were completely described in [3]. In this paper, we classify the standard elements of this lattice.
We need some definitions and notation. The free monoid over a countably infinite
alphabet is denoted by F 1 . As usual, elements of F 1 are called words, while elements
of A are said to be letters. The words unlike letters are written in bold. Two parts
of an identity are connected by the symbol ≈, while the symbol = denotes, among
other things, the equality relation on the free monoid. The trivial variety of monoids
is denoted by T, while MON denotes the variety of all monoids. We denote by SL
the variety of all semilattice monoids. Monoid variety given by an identity system

Σ is denoted by var Σ. Put
C2 = var{x2 ≈ x3 , xy ≈ yx}.
For convenience, we formulate the main results of [3].
Proposition 1 ( [3, Theorem 1.1]). For a monoid variety V, the following are
equivalent:
(i) V is a modular, lower-modular and upper-modular element of the lattice
MON;
(ii) V is a neutral element of the lattice MON;
(iii) V is one of the varieties T, SL or MON.

Proposition 2 ( [3, Theorem 1.2]). For a monoid variety V, the following are
equivalent:
(i) V is a modular and upper-modular element of the lattice MON;
(ii) V is a costandard element of the lattice MON;
(iii) V is one of the varieties T, SL, C2 or MON.



The main result of the paper is the following
Theorem 1. For a monoid variety V, the following are equivalent:

a modular and lower-modular element of the lattice MON;
a standard element of the lattice MON;
a neutral element of the lattice MON;
one of the varieties T, SL or MON.

We note that the equivalence of the claims (iii) and (iv) of Theorem 1 follows
from Proposition 1. It is natural to compare Theorem 1 and Propositions 1 and 2
with the results concerning the special elements of lattice of semigroup varieties
denoted by SEM (the survey of these results can be found in [13]). The properties
of being neutral and standard elements are not equivalent in the lattice SEM (this
fact follows from Theorems 3.3 and 3.4 of [13]), while the properties of being neutral
and costandard elements are equivalent in this lattice (see [13, Theorem 3.4]). In
contrary with the semigroup case, the properties of being neutral and costandard
elements are not equivalent (see Propositions 1 and 2), while the properties of being
neutral and standard elements are equivalent in MON (Theorem 1 of this work).
Theorem 1 implies that an element of MON is neutral if and only if it is both
modular and lower-modular in MON. However, this is not true for the lattice SEM
(this fact follows from Theorems 3.2 and 3.4 and Corollary 3.9 of [13]). At the
same time, an element of SEM is neutral if and only if it is both upper-modular
and lower-modular (see [13, Theorem 3.4]). The question about whether the same
result holds in the lattices MON remains open. Finally, every standard element
is costandard one but a standard element does not have to be costandard one in
MON (Theorem 1 and Proposition 2). At the same time, every costandard element
is standard one but the properties of being standard and costandard elements are
not equivalent in SEM (Theorems 3.3 and 3.4 of [13]).
To prove the main result, we need several auxiliary statements. We start with
the fact that is a part of the semigroup folklore (it is noted in [6, Section 1.1]
and [3, Proposition 2.1], for instance).

Proposition 3. The map from MON into SEM that maps a monoid variety generated by a monoid M to the semigroup variety generated by M is an embedding of
the lattice MON into the lattice SEM.

Recall that the variety V is said to be periodic if all its monoids are periodic
and aperiodic if it does not contain any non-trivial group. A monoid variety V is
called proper if V 6= MON. The proof of the following statement is similar to the
arguments from the second paragraph of Section 2.1 of [11].
Lemma 1. Let V be a proper monoid variety. If V is a lower-modular element of
MON then V is periodic.
Proof. Suppose that V is non-periodic. Then V contains the variety of all commutative monoids. It is proved [12, Lemma 2.16] that the variety of all semigroups
is generated by all minimal non-Abelian varieties of groups. This fact and Proposition 3 imply that there exists a minimal non-Abelian group variety G such that
G * V. Put W = V ∨ G. Clearly, V ⊂ W. As is well known, every semigroup
variety that contains the variety of all commutative semigroups is generated by
all its nilpotent and so aperiodic members (see [14], for instance). This fact and
Proposition 3 imply that there exists an aperiodic variety K such that K ⊆ W but
K * V. Put Y = V ∨ K. Clearly, V ⊂ Y ⊆ W. It is proved in [11, Lemma 1.4]
that if U is a semigroup variety and X is an aperiodic semigroup variety then every
group from the variety U ∨ X belongs to U. Since G * V, this fact and Proposition 3 imply that G * V ∨ K = Y. Therefore, the variety G ∧ Y is commutative,
whence G ∧ Y ⊆ V. Since V is a lower-modular element of MON and V ⊆ Y, we
have
V = (G ∧ Y) ∨ V = (G ∨ V) ∧ Y = W ∧ Y = Y,
a contradiction with V ⊂ Y. We have proved that the variety V is periodic.

The following notion was introduced by Perkins [10] and often appeared in the
literature. For any word w, let S(w) denote the Rees quotient monoid of F 1 over
the ideal of all words that are not subwords of w. A word w is an isoterm for a
variety V if V violates any non-trivial identity of the form w ≈ w′ . Put
Cn = var{xn ≈ xn+1 , xy ≈ yx} where n ≥ 2,
E = var{x2 ≈ x3 , x2 y ≈ xyx, x2 y 2 ≈ y 2 x2 }.
Note that the variety C2 has already introduced before Proposition 1.
Lemma 2. Let V be a monoid variety that contains the variety E. Suppose that
there exists n ≥ 2 such that V does not contain the variety Cn+1 . Put
X = (V ∨ Cn+1 ) ∧ var{xk y ≈ yxk | k > n},
Y = (V ∨ Cn+1 ) ∧ var{xk y ≈ yxk | k ≥ n}.
Then Y ⊂ X and the varieties X, Y and V generate the 5-element non-modular
sublattice in MON. In particular, V is not a modular element of the lattice MON.
Proof. Evidently, Y ⊆ X. We are going to verify that this inclusion is strict. In
view of [5, Proposition 4.2], if E satisfies an identity yxn ≈ w then w = yxt for some
t ≥ 2. If the identity yxn ≈ w holds in Cn+1 then it follows from commutative law.
Taking into account the inclusion E ⊆ V we have that the word yxn is an isoterm
for V ∨ Cn+1 . Then S(yxn ) ∈ V ∨ Cn+1 by [7, Lemma 5.3]. Evidently, S(yxn )

4

satisfies the identity xk y ≈ yxk whenever k > n. It follows that S(yxn ) ∈ X. On
the other hand, S(yxn ) ∈
/ Y because S(yxn ) violates the identity
xn y ≈ yxn .

(1)

Thus, Y ⊂ X.
It is well known and can be easily verified that if a monoid variety does not
contain Cn+1 then this variety satisfies the identity
xn ≈ xn+m

(2)

for some natural m (see [5, Lemma 2.5], for instance). In particular, an identity of
such a form holds in V. Then V violates the identity
xn+m y ≈ yxn+m .

(3)

Therefore, this identity does not hold in V ∨ Cn+1 , whence X ⊂ V ∨ Cn+1 .
Evidently, V ∨X = V ∨Cn+1 = V ∨Y. To complete the proof it remains to note
that V ∧ X = V ∧ Y. Indeed, the variety V ∧ X satisfies the identity (1) because
this identity follows from the identities (2) and (3). This implies the required
conclusion.

In fact, the following statement is well known (see [5, Lemma 2.1], for instance).
Lemma 3. For a monoid variety V, the following are equivalent:
a) V is a group variety;
b) V satisfies an identity u ≈ v such that u contains a letter which does not
occur in v;
c) SL * V.

A variety of monoids is called completely regular if it consists of completely regular
monoids (i.e., unions of groups).
Proof of Theorem 1. The claims (iii) and (iv) are equivalent by Proposition 1. The
implications (iii) ⇒ (ii) ⇒ (i) are obvious. It remains to prove the implication (i)
⇒ (iv). Let V be a proper monoid variety that is a modular and lower-modular
element of the lattice MON. Suppose that V is completely regular. If U is a
completely regular monoid variety that is a modular element in MON then U is
commutative because
C2 ∨ (D ∧ U) ⊂ D ∧ (C2 ∨ U),
where D = var{x2 ≈ x3 , x2 y ≈ xyx ≈ yx2 }, otherwise by [3, Lemma 3.1] and U is
aperiodic because
Q ∨ (B2,3 ∧ U) ⊂ B2,3 ∧ (Q ∨ U),
2

where B2,3 = var{x ≈ x3 } and Q = var{yxyzxz ≈ yxzxyxz}, otherwise by [3,
Lemma 3.2]. Since every completely regular aperiodic variety is a variety of idempotent monoids, this implies that V ⊆ SL. Therefore, V ∈ {T, SL}.
Suppose now that V is a non-completely regular monoid variety. Lemma 1
implies that V is periodic. It is well known that V satisfies the identity (2) for
some n ≥ 2 and m ≥ 1. The identity (2) does not hold in Cn+1 , whence Cn+1 * V.
Then E * V by Lemma 2. Put W = V ∨ E. Clearly, V ⊂ W.

Put LRB = var{xy ≈ xyx}. We are going to verify that LRB * W. If V is
non-commutative then Lemmas 2.14 and 4.1 and Proposition 4.2 of [5] imply that
V satisfies the identity
(4)

yxr ≈ xs yxt

for some s ≥ 1, t ≥ 0, s + t ≥ 2 and r ≥ 2. If V is commutative then V satisfies
the identity (4) with s = t = 1 and r = 2. The variety E satisfies the identity
(5)

y 2 xr ≈ xs y 2 xt .

The identity (5) follows from the identity (4). Therefore, the identity (5) holds in
W. On the other hand, LRB satisfies the identities y 2 xr ≈ yx and xs y 2 xt ≈ xy.
Therefore, LRB violates the identity (5), whence LRB * W.
In view of [15, Proposition 4.7], the subvariety lattice of LRB is the chain T ⊂
SL ⊂ LRB. According to Lemma 3, SL ⊆ V and, therefore, SL ⊆ W. It follows
that
V ∨ (W ∧ LRB) = V ∨ SL = V.
On the other hand, in view of [5, Corollary 2.6], every non-completely regular
monoid variety contains the variety C2 . It is proved in [9, Proposition 4.1] that
E ⊂ C2 ∨ LRB. This implies that W ⊆ V ∨ LRB. Thus,
W ∧ (V ∨ LRB) = W.
Then, since V ⊂ W, the variety V is not a lower-modular element in MON. A
contradiction.

In view of Proposition 1, an element is neutral in MON if and only if this element
is both modular, lower-modular and upper-modular in MON. Theorem 1 establishes
more stronger result. Namely, the property of being upper-modular element can
be omitted. In view of Propositions 1 and 2, the variety C2 is a costandard (and,
therefore, a modular) element but is not a neutral one in MON. Thus, the property
of being lower-modular element cannot be omitted. The following question is still
open
Question 1. Is it true that an arbitrary lower-modular element of the lattice MON
is a neutral element of this lattice?
In conclusion, we note that the properties of being modular and costandard
elements are not equivalent in MON. Indeed, Proposition 2 implies that the variety
D is not a costandard element of MON. At the same time, the following statement
is true.
Proposition 4. The variety D is a modular element of the lattice MON.
Proof. Suppose that D is not a modular element of the lattice MON. Then [8,
Proposition 2.1] implies that there exist varieties U and W such that U ⊂ W and
the varieties D, U and W generate the 5-element non-modular sublattice in MON.
Clearly, D * U and D * W. It is verified in [5, Lemma 2.12] that any variety that
does not contain D is either completely regular or commutative. It follows that W
is either completely regular or commutative.
Recall that an element x of a lattice L is called codistributive if
x ∧ (y ∨ z) = (x ∧ y) ∨ (x ∧ z)

6

for all y, z ∈ L. It is well known that a codistributive element is upper-modular.
It is proved in [3, Proposition 1.4] that each commutative variety of monoids is
a codistributive and so an upper-modular element of the lattice MON. Since the
varieties D, U and W generate the 5-element non-modular sublattice in MON, the
variety W cannot be commutative. Therefore, W is completely regular. Then U
is completely regular too.
The rest of the proof largely repeats the arguments from the last paragraph of
the proof of Theorem 1.2 in [3]. We provide these arguments here for the reader
convenience and for the sake of completeness. First, suppose that U is a group
variety. Then SL * U. If W consists not only of groups then Lemma 3 implies
that SL ⊆ W. Then U∧D = T but SL ⊆ W∧D. This contradicts U∧D = W∧D.
So, W is a group variety. It is proved in [12, Lemma 2.6] that if X is an aperiodic
semigroup variety and G is a group variety then G is the largest group subvariety
in G ∨ X. This fact and Proposition 3 imply that U is the largest group subvariety
in U ∨ D. But this is impossible because W is a group variety and
U ⊂ W ⊂ W ∨ D = U ∨ D.
Suppose now that U is not a group variety. Then SL ⊆ U by Lemma 3. Then
SL ⊆ U ∧ D = W ∧ D ⊆ W, whence W is not a group variety. Since U is
completely regular, U satisfies x ≈ xn+1 for some natural n. Let n be the least
number with such a property, while Σ be an identity basis of the variety U. We
denote by ζ the endomorphism of the monoid F 1 which maps each letter x into the
word xn+1 . Put
Σ∗ = {ζ(u) ≈ ζ(v) | u ≈ v ∈ Σ}.
Obviously, U = var{x ≈ xn+1 , Σ∗ }. If p ≈ q ∈ Σ∗ then the words p and q depend
on the same letters by Lemma 3. It follows from [5, Proposition 2.13] that if some
words s and t do not contain simple letters (i.e., that occur in the word only once)
and depend on the same letters then the identity s ≈ t holds in D. This fact implies
that D satisfies Σ∗ . Since U ∨ D = W ∨ D, the variety W satisfies Σ∗ too. Since
D satisfies x2 ≈ x3 and U satisfies x ≈ xn+1 , the identity x2 ≈ xn+2 hokds in
U ∨ D = W ∨ D. Taking into account that W is completely regular, we get that
x ≈ xn+1 holds in W. Then W ⊆ U. We obtain a contradiction with the choice
of the varieties U and W. Thus, we have proved that D is a modular element of
the lattice MON.
