Abstract. We introduce real structures on L-twisted Higgs pairs over a compact connected
Riemann surface X equipped with an anti-holomorphic involution, where L is a holomorphic
line bundle on X with a real structure, and prove a Hitchin–Kobayashi correspondence for
the L-twisted Higgs pairs. Real GR -Higgs bundles, where GR is a real form of a connected
semisimple complex affine algebraic group G, constitute a particular class of examples of
these pairs. In this case, the real structure of the moduli space of G-Higgs pairs is defined
using a conjugation of G that commutes with the one defining the real form GR and a compact conjugation of G preserving GR . We establish a homeomorphism between the moduli
space of real GR -Higgs bundles and the moduli space of representations of the fundamental
group of X in GR that can be extended to a representation of the orbifold fundamental
group of X into a certain enlargement of GR with quotient Z/2Z. Finally, we show how real
GR -Higgs bundles appear naturally as fixed points of certain anti-holomorphic involutions
of the moduli space of GR -Higgs bundles, constructed using the real structures on G and
X. A similar result is proved for the representations of the orbifold fundamental group.

1. Introduction
In recent years, much attention has been paid to the theory of Higgs pairs. The study of
these objects is primarily motivated by various moduli problems arising from gauge theory,
algebraic geometry, symplectic geometry and topology. To recall the definition of a Higgs
pair, let X be a compact connected Riemann surface, G a connected reductive complex affine
algebraic group, V a complex vector space, ρ : G −→ GL(V) a holomorphic representation
and L a holomorphic line bundle over X. A L-twisted Higgs pair (E, ϕ) of type ρ is a
pair consisting of a holomorphic principal G-bundle E over X and a holomorphic section ϕ
of V ⊗ L, where V := E(V) is the holomorphic vector bundle over X associated to E via
ρ. In [GGM1], the notion of α-polystability for these pairs was introduced, where α is an
element of the center of the Lie algebra k of a fixed maximal compact subgroup K ⊂ G.
The Hitchin-Kobayashi correspondence in this context, also proved in [GGM1], has the
following formulation:
Once we fix a Kähler form ω of X, a L-twisted Higgs pair (E, ϕ) of type ρ is α-polystable
if and only if there is a reduction h of structure group of the principal G-bundle E, to the
maximal compact subgroup
K ⊂ G,
that satisfies the Hermite–Einstein–Higgs equation
√
Λ Fh + µh (ϕ) = − −1 α ,
(1.1)
where Fh is the curvature of the unique connection, on the principal K-bundle EK ⊂ E
corresponding to the reduction h, which is compatible with the holomorphic structure of E,
while Λ denotes the contraction of differential forms on X using the Kähler form ω, and µh
is a moment map that depends on h.

The construction of the above mentioned moment map µh requires fixing a bi-invariant
inner product B on the Lie algebra k = Lie(K), a K-invariant Hermitian product h , i on V as
well as a Hermitian metric hL on L. Examples of twisted Higgs pairs are quiver bundles, Higgs
bundles and Hodge bundles among other objects (see [ABG, BrGP, BGGH, GGM1, GR]
and references therein for examples and more on Higgs pairs).
One of the main goals of this paper is to extend the above correspondence to the context
where all the objects are equipped with real structures. By these we mean anti-holomorphic

involutions σX and σG on X and G, respectively, an anti-linear involution σV on V such that
the holomorphic representation ρ is compatible with respect to σG and σV , as well as an antiholomorphic involution σL on L over σX , which is anti-linear on the fibers. A (σX , σG , c)-real
structure on a holomorphic principal G-bundle E over X is an anti-holomorphic automorphism σE of E over the involution σX of X, such that σE (eg) = σE (e) σG (g) and σE2 (e) = e c,
for all e ∈ E and g ∈ G, where c ∈ Z2σG ∩ Ker(ρ) with Z2σG being the subgroup of the
center Z(G) of G consisting of all the elements of order two invariant under the involution
σG . With these real structures in place, set
σ = (σX , σG , c, σL , σV , ±) .

A σ -real L-twisted Higgs pair of type ρ is a triple of the form (E, ϕ, σE ), where
• (E, ϕ) is a L-twisted Higgs pair of type ρ,
• σE is a (σX , σG , c)-real structure on E, and
∗
• ϕ satisfies the condition (σV ⊗ σL )(ϕ) = ±σX
ϕ, with σV being the involution of
V = E(V) induced by σE and σV .
A reduction of structure group EK ⊂ E of E to the maximal compact subgroup K is
said to be σE -compatible if it is preserved by the self-map σE of E. We prove the following
Hitchin–Kobayashi correspondence (see Theorem 4.1):
Theorem 1.1. A σ -real L-twisted Higgs pair (E, ϕ, σE ) of type ρ is polystable if and only if
there is a σE -compatible reduction h of the structure group of E, from G to K, that satisfies
equation (1.1).
In order to prove Theorem 1.1, we first adapt the arguments in [GGM1] to reduce the
proof to the case of stable Higgs pairs. The main difficulty here is to characterize the space
of infinitesimal automorphisms for a stable σ -real L-twisted Higgs pair (E, ϕ, σE ), taking
into account our stability condition that involves a condition on the adjoint bundle Ad(E).
Once that is achieved, we adapt the arguments in [BGM] to prove the above theorem in the
stable case. This approach involves finding a minimizing sequence of σE -compatible metrics
for the integral of the moment map (1.1), converging weakly to the solution we are seeking.
Now, let GR be a real form of a connected semisimple complex affine algebraic group
G. Let H R ⊂ GR be a maximal compact subgroup, and gR = hR ⊕ mR be the Cartan
decomposition of gR , the Lie algebra of GR , where hR is the Lie algebra of H R and mR is
its orthogonal complement with respect to the Killing form on gR . Let H and m be the
complexifications of H R and mR respectively.
A particular class of L-twisted Higgs pairs are the GR -Higgs bundles. For a GR -Higgs
bundle, the above line bundle L is the holomorphic cotangent bundle KX of X, the structure
group is H, while ρ is the adjoint representation ι : H −→ GL(m). In other words, a GR Higgs bundle is a pair (E, ϕ), where E is a holomorphic principal H-bundle on X and ϕ is a
holomorphic section of the holomorphic vector bundle E(m) ⊗ KX . We recall that the nonabelian Hodge correspondence for GR -Higgs bundles produces a homeomorphism between
the moduli space M(GR ) of polystable GR -Higgs bundles on X and the character variety
R(GR ) of equivalence classes of reductive representations of the fundamental group of X in
GR (see [GGM1]).
Another main result of this paper is the extension of the non-abelian Hodge correspondence
to the context of real GR -Higgs bundles, where GR is, as above, a real form of a connected

semisimple complex affine algebraic group G. For this set-up, we need to consider a real
structure σG on G which satisfies the condition that it commutes with a fixed compact
conjugation τ and the conjugation µ of G defining the real form GR . Then σG preserves
H while dσG preserves m. Moreover, ι is a representation compatible with σG and dσG .
Real GR -Higgs bundles are σ -real KX -twisted Higgs pairs of type ι, where σV = dσG , while
σL = σKX is the natural anti-holomorphic involution of L = KX induced by σX . Note that
the case of real GR -Higgs bundles generalizes the case of real Higgs bundles for a complex
group studied in [BGH1], [BGH3] and [BHu], since a complex semisimple Lie group G can be
viewed as a real form of G × G, where the anti-holomorphic involution is (x, y) 7−→ (y, x).

To describe the other side of the non-abelian Hodge correspondence, let Γ(X, x) be the
orbifold fundamental group of (X, σX ) for a base point x ∈ X. Let
c ∈ Z2σG (H) ∩ Ker(ι) ∩ Z(GR ) ,

where Z(H) and Z(GR ) are the centers of H and GR respectively, and Z2σG (H) is the subgroup
bR = G
bR (σG , c) be the group
of elements of order 2 in Z(H) invariant under σG . Also, let G

Let R(GR , σX , σG , c, ±) be the variety consisting of GR -conjugacy classes of (σX , σG , c, ±)bR whose restriction to π1 (X, x) is reductive,

that is, its conjugacy class is an element in R(GR ).
We prove the following (see Theorem 5.6):

Theorem 1.2. There is a canonical homeomorphism between R(GR , σX , σG , c, ±) and the
moduli space M(GR , σX , σG , c, ±) of polystable (σX , σG , c, ±)-real GR -Higgs bundles.
The proof of Theorem 1.2 crucially uses Theorem 1.1 and an appropriate version of the
Donaldson–Corlette theorem on the existence of harmonic metrics. It may be mentioned
that Theorem 1.2 could be the starting point to identify higher Teichmüller spaces in this
real context, as it is done in the usual theory of GR -Higgs bundles (see [GP] for a review).
Real GR -Higgs bundles appear in a natural way as fixed points of the involutions of the
moduli space M(GR ) of GR -Higgs bundles defined by

The obvious forgetful map induces a map from M(GR , σX , σG , c, ±) to M(GR ), and we
prove the following (see Proposition 6.1):
Proposition 1.3. The image of M(GR , σX , σG , c, ±) in M(GR ) is contained in the fixed
±
point set M(GR )ιM (σX ,σG ) . Furthermore, if we restrict the involution ιM (σX , σG )± in (1.3)
to the subvariety of Mss (GR ) ⊂ M(GR ), consisting of stable and simple GR -Higgs bundles,
±
then Mss (GR )ιM (σX ,σG ) is contained in the image in M(GR ) of the union of moduli spaces
M(GR , σX , σG , c, ±) parameterized by elements c ∈ Z2σG (H) ∩ Ker(ι), where Z(H) is the
center of H and Z2σG (H) is the subgroup of elements of order two in Z(H) invariant under
σG .
We also prove a similar result for R(GR , σX , σG , c, ±), where the involutions of the character variety R(GR ) of the fundamental group of X in GR are given by

(1.4)

(See Proposition 6.2.)
When the group GR is complex, the moduli space M(GR ) is a hyper-Kähler manifold and
the fixed point sets of the involutions in (1.3) and (1.4) define branes, in the sense of [KW].
These branes have been studied in [BS], [BCFG], [BG], [FGOP], [GR], [GW] and [BGH2].
We note that their importance stems from their close relation with mirror symmetry and
the Langlands correspondence.
In some sense, in this paper, we are considering doubly real Higgs bundles since we are
studying real structures on Higgs bundles whose structure group is already real. This is
perfectly possible since, although the group GR is a real form of a complex group G, GR -Higgs
bundles are holomorphic objects on X even if GR does not have a complex structure, and
hence the reality conditions can be defined by choosing another conjugation of G preserving
GR as well as a conjugation of X. As we have explained above, in the paper we go beyond
Higgs bundles, studying real structures on more general Higgs pairs.
The article is organized as follows. First, we review in Section 2 the notions of real structures for the main objects that will be used in the subsequent sections, and we also analyze
the Chern correspondence between holomorphic structures and connections in the presence of
real structures. In Sections 3 and 4 we prove a Hitchin–Kobayashi correspondence for σ -real
L-twisted Higgs pairs (here we follow [GGM1] closely). Firstly, after defining these pairs, we
give some examples and recall the Hermite–Einstein–Higgs equation. We then prove that a
polystable σ -real L-twisted Higgs pair that is not stable admits a Jordan–Hölder reduction
and, as a consequence of it, we reduce the proof to the stable case. Following that, we reformulate our problem in terms of finding a metric on which the integral of the moment map
attains a minimum. Finally, we prove the converse which says that the existence of solutions
of the Hermite–Einstein–Higgs equation implies polystability. In Section 5, we prove the
non-abelian Hodge correspondence for real GR -Higgs bundles, where GR is a real form of a
connected semisimple complex Lie group G. We start by proving a bijective correspondence
between M(GR , σX , σG , c, ±) and the moduli space of triples consisting of a real structure
on a C ∞ principal H R -bundle, a compatible connection, and a real Higgs field satisfying the
Hitchin equations. We also prove an appropriate Donaldson–Corlette correspondence, showing the bijection between the moduli space of solutions to Hitchin equations and the moduli

6

space of compatible reductive flat GR -connections, which in turn is in bijective correspondence with R(GR , σX , σG , c, ±). Finally, in Section 6, we describe the relationship between
the fixed-point of the involutions in (1.3) and the moduli spaces M(GR , σX , σG , c, ±), where
c varies in Z2σG (H) ∩ Ker(ι). By the non-abelian Hodge correspondence, proved in the previous section, with the additional condition that c ∈ Z2σG (H) ∩ Ker(ι) ∩ Z(GR ), we obtain
a similar description for the fixed points of the involutions in (1.4) in terms of the moduli
spaces R(GR , σX , σG , c, ±).
2. Real structures
2.1. Real structures on complex Lie groups and their representations. We recall
that a real structure or conjugation on a reductive complex affine algebraic group G is
an anti-holomorphic involution of G. We denote by Conj(G) the set of conjugations on G,
and also denote by Aut2 (G) the set of holomorphic automorphisms of G of order two (and
the identity map). In Aut2 (G) and Conj(G) we define the equivalence relation σ ∼ σ ′ if and
only if there is some α ∈ Aut(G) with the property that σ ′ = α−1 ◦ σ ◦ α. Cartan proved
in [Ca] that there is a bijection
Conj(G)/∼ −→ Aut2 (G)/∼
[σ]
7−→
[θ] ,

(2.1)

which is constructed as follows: Fix a compact conjugation τ of G; now given any
σ ∈ Conj(G) ,
there is an element σ ′ ∈ Conj(G) such that σ ′ ∼ σ and θ := σ ′ ◦ τ ∈ Aut2 (G).
Proposition 2.1. Given any σ ∈ Conj(G), there is a maximal compact subgroup
K ⊂ G
such that σ(K) = K.
Proof. Given a compact conjugation τ , by the bijection in (2.1) there is a conjugation
σ ′ := α−1 ◦ σ ◦ α ,
for some α ∈ Aut(G), such that σ ′ ◦ τ = (σ ′ ◦ τ )−1 , and therefore we have
τ ◦ σ′ = σ′ ◦ τ ,

because τ and σ ′ are both involutions. Consider τ ′ := α ◦ τ ◦ α−1 ; then K := G
′
maximal compact subgroup of G. For any x ∈ Gτ , we have

(2.2)
τ′

is a

τ ′ (σ(x)) = α ◦ τ ◦ α−1 ◦ α ◦ σ ′ ◦ α−1 (x) = α ◦ τ ◦ σ ′ ◦ α−1 (x)
= α ◦ σ ′ ◦ α−1 ◦ α ◦ τ ◦ α−1 (x) = σ(τ ′ (x))
′

′

using Equation (2.2). This implies that σ(Gτ ) = Gτ .

An alternative proof: Using the involution σ of G, construct the semi-direct product
e be a maximal compact subgroup of G ⋊ (Z/2Z). Then K
e ∩ G is a
G ⋊ (Z/2Z). Let K
maximal compact subgroup of G which is preserved by σ.

Let G be a complex reductive affine algebraic group equipped with a real structure σG ,
and let V be a complex vector space equipped with a real structure σV : V −→ V, that
is, an anti-linear involution. A holomorphic representation ρ : G −→ GL(V) is (σG , σV )compatible if for every g ∈ G and v ∈ V, we have
σV ( ρ(g)(v)) = ρ(σG (g))(σV (v)) .

Example 2.2 (The adjoint representation). Let G be a complex group equipped with a real
structure σG . Then the corresponding R–linear automorphism dσG : g −→ g is a real
structure on the Lie algebra g of G. Since the adjoint action Ad : G −→ Aut(G) commutes
with σG , it follows that Ad : G −→ GL(g) is a (σG , dσG )-compatible representation.

Example 2.3 (The isotropy representation). Let GR be a real form of a connected reductive
Lie group G, and let τ ∈ Conj(G) be a compact conjugation. Denote Gτ by K. Let
µ ∈ Conj(G) be a conjugation such that the fixed point set (G)µ is GR . A conjugation
σ ∈ Conj(G) is called (µ, τ )-compatible if
(1) σ ◦ µ = µ ◦ σ , and
(2) σ ◦ τ = τ ◦ σ .

If σ is a (µ, τ )-compatible conjugation, then H R = GR ∩ K is a maximal compact subgroup
of GR , whose complexification H is preserved by σ. Moreover, the Cartan decomposition
gR = hR ⊕ mR and its complexification g = h ⊕ m are preserved by dσ. The adjoint
action of H R on mR (the isotropy representation) extends to the complexification, giving a
representation ι : H −→ GL(m) which is (σ, dσ)-compatible.
2.2. Real structures on Riemann surfaces and holomorphic bundles. We recall that
a real structure on a compact Riemann surface X is an anti-holomorphic involution
σX : X −→ X .

The pair (X, σX ) sometimes will be referred to as a Klein surface. Such pairs were first
studied in [Kl] and [We]. A morphism of Klein surfaces
f : (X, σX ) −→ (X ′ , σX ′ )

is a holomorphic map f : X −→ X ′ , such that f ◦ σX = σX ′ ◦ f . A Kähler form ω on
∗
a compact Klein surface (X, σX ) is called real if σX
ω = −ω. If ω is a Kähler form on X,
∗
then ω − σX ω is a real Kähler form on (X, σX ) (see [BGH1, p. 4]).

Let (X, σX ) be a Klein surface, and let V −→ X be a holomorphic vector bundle. A
σX -real structure on V is a C ∞ isomorphism σV : V −→ V such that the following
conditions hold:
(1) σV lifts σX , meaning that the diagram

is commutative,
(2) σV is anti-holomorphic,
(3) σV is C-anti-linear on the fibers of V , and
(4) σV2 = IdV .

8

Such a pair (V, σV ) will sometimes be referred to as a real holomorphic vector bundle. A
homomorphism of real holomorphic vector bundles
f : (V, σV ) −→ (V ′ , σV ′ )
is an OX –linear homomorphism f : V −→ V ′ satisfying the condition that
f ◦ σV = σV ′ ◦ f .
Real holomorphic vector bundles were introduced by Atiyah in [At2], and they were subsequently studied in [BCFG], [BG], [BHH], [LS], [Sc1] and [Sc2]. The topological classes of
these real bundles are described in [BHH, Section 4].
Let G be a reductive complex affine algebraic group equipped with a real structure σG ,
and let (X, σX ) be a Klein surface. The center of G will be denoted by Z. Let
Z2σG ⊂ Z
be the subgroup of Z consisting of elements of Z of order two (and the identity element)
that are invariant under the involution σG . Take any
c ∈ Z2σG .
Let E be a holomorphic principal G-bundle over X.
A (σX , σG , c)-real structure is a C ∞ diffeomorphism σE : E −→ E such that the
following four conditions holds:
(1) the diagram

is commutative, or in other words σE is a lift of σX ,
(2) σE is anti-holomorphic,
(3) σE (eg) = σE (e) σG (g), for all e ∈ E, g ∈ G , and
(4) σE2 (e) = ce .
A pair (E, σE ) satisfying the above four conditions will sometimes be referred to as a
(σX , σG , c)-real holomorphic G-bundle.
A morphism of (σX , σG , c)–real holomorphic G-bundles
f : (E, σE ) −→ (E ′ , σE ′ )
is a holomorphic isomorphism of principal G-bundles f : E −→ E ′ such that
f ◦ σE = σE ′ ◦ f .
In the literature, such bundles are known as pseudo-real principal bundles (see [BGH1],
[BGH3] and [BHu]). In [BGH3, Theorem 3.9], there is a description of the topological
classes of pseudo-real principal bundles.

2.3. Chern correspondence and real structures. It will be of importance for us to
think of a holomorphic principal bundle as a C ∞ principal bundle equipped with a complex
structure. To explain this in detail, let G be a reductive complex affine algebraic group
equipped with a real structure σG , and let (X, σX ) be a Klein surface. Take any c ∈ Z2σG ,
and let π : E −→ X be a C ∞ principal G-bundle over X. A (σX , σG , c)-real structure σE
on E is a lift of σX to E
σE : E −→ E
satisfying the conditions (1), (3) and (4) in the definition of a real structure of a holomorphic
G-bundle given above. An almost complex structure on E is a G-invariant smooth section
J of End(T E), where T E denotes the real tangent bundle of the total space of E, such that
• J 2 = −Id ,
• dπ ◦ J = JX ◦ dπ, where JX is the complex structure of X, and
• the map E × G −→ E giving the action of G on E is almost holomorphic. This
means that the differential of this map E × G −→ E commutes with the almost
complex structures; the almost complex structure of E × G is given by J and the
almost complex structure of G.
It can be shown that an almost complex structure on E is automatically a complex structure. Indeed, the obstruction to integrability of an almost complex structure on E is an
0,2
element of Ω0,2
= 0 as the
X (ad(E)), and it vanishes identically due to the fact that ΩX
complex dimension of X is one. Let C (E) be the space of all complex structures on E. A
complex structure JE ∈ C (E) is called σE -real if
JE ◦ dσE = −dσE ◦ JE .

(2.3)

We shall denote by C (E, σE ) the space of all complex structures on E that are σE -real. The
following proposition is a straight-forward fact.
Proposition 2.4. There is a bijection between C (E, σE ) and the space of all equivalence
classes of (σX , σG , c)-real holomorphic principal G-bundles (E, σE ) whose underlying smooth
principal G-bundle is E, such that the C ∞ isomorphism between E and E takes σE to σE .
Two such (σX , σG , c)-real holomorphic principal G-bundles (E, σE ) and (E ′ , σE′ ) are called
equivalent if the C ∞ isomorphism of principal G-bundles E −→ E ′ given by the identity
map of E is holomorphic and takes σE to σE′ .
Complex structures on E are closely related to connections on E. Let π : E −→ X be a
C ∞ principal G-bundle (here G could be any Lie group). Recall that a connection on E is
a horizontal distribution H ⊂ T E such that, for all e ∈ E,
Te E = (V E)e ⊕ He ,

where V E := kernel(dπ) is the vertical tangent bundle for the projection π, and the subbundle H ⊂ T E is preserved by the action of the group G on T E given by the action of
G on E. This is equivalent to having a g-valued 1-form A on E (with values in g), that is,
a smooth section of the bundle T ∗ E ⊗ g; again we require this A to be invariant under the
action of G, acting by a combination of the given action on E and the adjoint action on g
(equivalently, the map T E −→ g given by A is G-equivariant). Also, A should restrict to
the canonical right-invariant g-valued 1-form on the fibers of π. For details, see [KN, Ch. II].
Let now
ρ : G −→ GL(V)

10

I. BISWAS, L. A. CALVO, AND O. GARCÍA-PRADA

be a holomorphic representation of G on a complex vector space V, and let V = E(V) be
the associated smooth complex vector bundle. Recall that a connection A on E defines a
covariant derivative on V , that is a C–linear map
dA : Ω0 (X, V ) −→ Ω1 (X, V )

that V
satisfies the Leibniz rule; here Ωp (X, V ) denotes the space of all smooth sections of
V ⊗ p T ∗ X.
Now, take G to be a reductive complex affine algebraic group equipped with a real structure
σG , and let (X, σX ) be a Klein surface; also fix an element c ∈ Z2σG .

Given a smooth principal G-bundle E on X equipped with a (σX , σG , c)-real structure
σE , we can impose a reality condition for a connection on E. A connection A on E is said to
be σE -compatible if the horizontal distribution H ⊂ T E corresponding to A satisfies the
condition
d(σE )(He ) = HσE (e) , for all e ∈ E .
This is equivalent to the condition that the corresponding g-valued one-form A : T E −→ g
is (dσE , dσG )-real, meaning
dσG ◦ A ◦ dσE = A .
Let A (E) be the set of all connections on E. We shall denote by
A (E, σE ) ⊂ A (E)

the subset consisting of all σE -compatible connections.
Let

K ⊂ G
be a maximal compact subgroup of G preserved by the involution σG (see Proposition 2.1).
Therefore, the involution σE of E defines an involution of the quotient space E/K. A C ∞
reduction of structure group h : X −→ E/K of the principal G-bundle E, from G to K, is
called σE -compatible if the image of h is preserved by this involution of E/K. Note that h
is σE -compatible if and only if the reduction of structure group of E to the subgroup K
EK ⊂ E

corresponding to h satisfies the condition σE (EK ) = EK .
Let
EK ⊂ E
be a σE -compatible reduction of structure group to the maximal compact subgroup K of G.
We denote by σEK the restriction of the involution σE to EK . The space of all connections
on the principal K-bundle EK will be denoted by A (EK ). Let
A (EK , σEK ) ⊂ A (EK )

be the subset consisting of all σEK -compatible connections. Recall that a connection ∇ ∈
A (EK ) lies in A (EK , σEK ) if and only if the horizontal distribution H(A) ⊂ T EK for A is
preserved by the involution of T EK given by σEK .
There is a natural bijection between the space of complex structures C (E) on E and the
space of connections A (EK ) on EK . This bijection is given by the Chern map
C : C (E) −→ A (EK )

which is constructed as follows. For a complex structure J ∈ C (E), the horizontal distribution on EK defined by the connection C(J) is given by
J(T EK )) ∩ T EK ⊂ T EK .
For details see [At1, pp. 191–192, Proposition 5] and [Sin, p. 586].
If now E has a σE -real structure, and EK is a σE -compatible reduction of structure group,
we have the following.
Proposition 2.5. The Chern map defines a bijection between C (E, σE ) and A (EK , σEK ).

The converse is proved similarly.

Let X be a Riemann surface with complex structure JX and equipped with a real structure
σX . Let G be a reductive complex affine algebraic group equipped with real structure σG ,
and let V be a complex vector space equipped with real structure σV . Let ρ : G −→ GL(V)
be a (σG , σV )-compatible holomorphic representation. Let E be a C ∞ principal G-bundle
over X equipped with a (σX , σG , c)-real structure σE as well as a complex structure J. The
associated vector bundle V = E(V) is equipped with the following structures:

∂ JV ϕ = ∂ A ϕ := π 0,1 dA ϕ
for ϕ ∈ Ω0 (X, V ), where π 0,1 is the projection of complex 1-forms to (0, 1)-forms.
Example 2.6 (Compatible Hermitian metric). Let E be a C ∞ principal GL(n, C)-bundle, and
let V := E(Cn ) be the associated complex vector bundle of rank n on X for the standard
representation of GL(n, C) on Cn . Let σGL(n,C) be the real structure on GL(n, C) that sends
any matrix A to its conjugate matrix A. Then a (σX , σGL(n,C) , c)-real structure σE on E
corresponds to a σX -real structure σV on V . Giving a σE -compatible reduction on E to U(n)

3. Real twisted Higgs pairs, stability and equations
3.1. Real twisted Higgs pairs. Let X be a compact connected Riemann surface, and let
G be a connected reductive complex affine algebraic group. Let V be a complex vector space
and ρ : G −→ GL(V) a holomorphic representation. Let E be a holomorphic principal
G-bundle on X. We denote by V the holomorphic vector bundle E(V) associated to E via
ρ. Let L be a holomorphic line bundle over X.
A L-twisted Higgs pair of type ρ is a pair (E, ϕ) consisting of a holomorphic principal
G-bundle E over X and a holomorphic section ϕ of the holomorphic vector bundle V ⊗ L,
where V is defined above.
Let σX and σG be real structures on X and G, respectively. Let σV be a real structure
on V and ρ : G −→ GL(V) a (σG , σV )-compatible holomorphic representation. This means
that
ρ(g)(σV (v)) = (ρ(σG (g)))(v)
(3.1)
for all g ∈ G and v ∈ V. Let σE be a real structure on E.
Let Z be the center of G, and let

Z2σG ⊂ Z

be the subgroup consisting of all t ∈ Z, such that

• the order of t is two (if t is not the identity element), and
• σG (t) = t.

ker ρ. Let (E, σE ) be a (σX , σG , c)-real principal G-bundle over (X, σX ).

Consider the map E × V −→ E × V that sends any (e, v) to (σE (e), σV (v)). This map
descends to an anti-holomorphic map
σV : V −→ V ,
because ρ satisfies (3.1). This map σV defines a real structure on the vector bundle V ,
because c ∈ Ker(ρ). Let (L, σL ) be a real holomorphic line bundle over (X, σX ). The
tensor product σV ⊗ σL : V ⊗ L −→ V ⊗ L is clearly a real structure on V ⊗ L.

A (σX , σG , c, σL , σV , ±)-real structure on a L-twisted Higgs pair (E, ϕ) of type ρ is an
anti-holomorphic map σE : E −→ E such that (E, σE ) is a (σX , σG , c)-real holomorphic
principal G-bundle over (X, σX ), and the section ϕ ∈ H 0 (X, V ⊗ L) satisfies the equation
∗
σV ⊗ σL (ϕ) = ±ϕ ◦ σX =: ±σX
ϕ.

(3.2)

Denote by σ = (σX , σG , c, σL , σV , ±). The triple (E, ϕ, σE ) will sometimes be referred to as
a σ -real twisted Higgs pair of type ρ.
We give some concrete examples of real Higgs pairs.
Example 3.1. Let (G, σG ) be a reductive complex affine algebraic group equipped with an
anti-holomorphic involution. Let (L, σL ) = (KX , σKX ) be the canonical line bundle of X
equipped with the anti-holomorphic involution induced by σX . Set (V, σV ) = (g, dσG ). The
adjoint representation Ad : G −→ GL(g) is (σG , σV )-real. In this case, σ -real KX -twisted
Higgs pairs of type Ad are known in the literature as pseudo-real G-Higgs bundles (see
[BGH1], [BGH3] and [BHu]).
Example 3.2. Let G = GL(n, C), V = Sym2 (Cn ) and ρ the representation on V induced
by the standard representation of GL(n, C) on Cn . Let L be a holomorphic line bundle on
X. A L-twisted Higgs pairs of type ρ is an L-quadratic pair. They are also known in the
literature as conic bundles or quadric bundles (see, for example, [GGM2, Ol]). If we equip
G and V with complex conjugations σG (A) = A and σV (v) = v, for all A ∈ GL(n, C) and
v ∈ V, then ρ is a (σG , σV )-compatible representation, thus defining a real structure σV on
V . Let σL be a real structure on L. Then σ -real L-twisted Higgs pairs of type ρ are real
L-quadratic pairs (V, ϕ, σV ); by this we mean that (V, σV ) is a real holomorphic vector
bundle of rank n, and ϕ : V −→ V ∗ ⊗L is a real section, meaning that ϕ◦σV = σVt ⊗σL ◦ϕ.
Example 3.3. Let G = GL(n1 , C)×GL(n2 , C), V = Hom(Cn2 , Cn1 ), ρ is the representation
of G given by ρ(A, B)(T ) = A◦T ◦B −1 , and L is the trivial holomorphic line bundle OX . The
L-twisted Higgs pairs of type ρ are known in the literature as holomorphic triples (see, for
example, [BrGP]). We equip G and V with real structures σG , σV , defined by σG (A × B) =
A × B and σV (T )v = T v, for all A ∈ GL(n1 , C), B ∈ GL(n2 , C), T ∈ Hom(Cn2 , Cn1 )
and v ∈ Cn2 . Then ρ is a (σG , σV )-compatible representation. We equip OX with the
real structure induced by a real structure σX on X. The σ -real OX -twisted Higgs pairs of
type ρ are real holomorphic triples, that consist of two real holomorphic vector bundles
(V1 , σV1 ), (V2 , σV2 ) and a real morphism φ : (V1 , σV1 ) −→ (V2 , σV2 ).
3.2. Stability. Let K be a σG -invariant maximal compact subgroup of a connected reductive
complex affine algebraic group G, and let
B ∈ Sym2 (g∗ )G

14

I. BISWAS, L. A. CALVO, AND O. GARCÍA-PRADA

be a K-invariant non-degenerate bilinear form √
on the Lie algebra g = Lie(G) which is
positive on k = Lie(K). Let s be an element of −1 · k; we note that the following objects
are associated to s:
• Ps := {g ∈ G | ets ge−ts is bounded when t → ∞} is a parabolic subgroup of G,
• Ls := {g ∈ Ps | Ad(g)s = s} is a Levi subgroup of the parabolic subgroup Ps ,
where Ad : G −→ Aut(g) is the Adjoint representation,
• ps := {x ∈ g | Ad(ets )x is bounded when t → ∞} is the Lie algebra of Ps ,
• ls := {x ∈ g | [x, s] = 0} is the Lie algebra of Ls ,
• Vs := {v ∈ V | ρ(ets v) is bounded when t → ∞},
• V0s := {v ∈ V | ρ(ets v) = v for all t}, and
• χs is the dual of s with respect to B, meaning that B induces an isomorphism
B : k −→ k∗ , using which we have χs := B(s)|ps ∩k .
Remark 3.4. A character of ps is a complex linear map ps −→ C that factors through the
quotient ps /[ps , ps ]. Since B(s, [ps , ps ]) = 0, the above defined homomorphism χs produces
a strictly anti-dominant character of ps . Conversely, given an anti-dominant character χ of
, where zLs is the center of the Levi subalgebra ls .
ps , we have χ ∈ (ps /[ps , ps ])∗ ∼
= (zLs )∗√
−1
For sχ = B (χ), we have sχ ∈ zLs ⊂ −1 · k.
We now recall
√ the definition of the degree of a principal G-bundle E with respect to an
element s ∈ −1 · k and a holomorphic reduction σ of the structure group of E from G to
Ps . Let EPs ⊂ E be the holomorphic principal Ps -bundle corresponding to σ. By [GGM1,
Lemma 2.4], there is a rational number q such that (χs )q lifts to a character χ
bs of Ps . Then
χs ) is a line bundle. Now define the degree
EPs (b
deg E(σ, s) :=

1
χs ) .
deg EPs (b
q

(3.3)

Let σG be a conjugation on G, and let (E, σE ) be a (σX , σG , c)-real holomorphic principal
G-bundle over X. We denote by Ad(E) the group scheme E×Ad G over X, which is associated
to E via the adjoint action of G on itself. The real structures σE and σG together define a
real structure σAd(E) on Ad(E), because the homomorphism Ad : G −→ Aut(G) given by
the adjoint action is compatible with σG (see Example 2.2).
The main change in the definition of stability for σ -real L-twisted Higgs pairs vis-à-vis the
definition of stability of the underlying Higgs pairs is that we must consider only holomorphic
reductions EPs ⊂ E of E from G to Ps such that
σAd(E) (Ad(EPs )) = Ad(EPs ) .

(3.4)

More specifically, for α ∈ z(k), a σ -real L-twisted Higgs pair (E, ϕ, σE ) is
√
• α-semistable if for every s ∈ −1k and for every holomorphic reduction of structure
group σ of E to Ps such that
(1) the holomorphic principal Ps -bundle EPs ⊂ E corresponding to σ satisfies the
equation in (3.4), and
(2) ϕ ∈ H 0 (X, EPs (Vs ) ⊗ L),
the following inequality holds:
deg E(s, σ) − B(s, α) ≥ 0 ;

REAL HIGGS PAIRS AND NON-ABELIAN HODGE CORRESPONDENCE

√
• α-stable if for every s ∈ −1k \ Ker(dρ) and for every reduction σ of structure
group of E to Ps satisfying (3.4) as well as the condition ϕ ∈ H 0 (X, EPs (Vs ) ⊗ L),
the inequality
deg E(s, σ) − B(s, α) > 0

holds;
• α-polystable if it is α-semistable and furthermore, for every reduction σ of structure
group of E to a parabolic subgroup Ps satisfying (3.4) as well as the two conditions
ϕ ∈ H 0 (X, EPs (Vs ) ⊗ L) and
deg E(s, σ) − B(s, α) = 0 ,
there is a holomorphic reduction of structure group
ELs ⊂ EPs

(3.5)

of EPs to the Levi subgroup Ls ⊂ Ps such that
σE (ELs ) = ELs
and ϕ ∈ H 0 (X, ELs (V0s ) ⊗ L).
Remark 3.5. If the condition in (3.4) is dropped, then we obtain the usual definition of
stability for the L-twisted Higgs pair (E, ϕ) underlying the triple (E, ϕ, σE ). The naive
condition for σ -real L-twisted Higgs pairs, considering only those parabolic subgroups Ps
such that σG (Ps ) = Ps , is not the right one for stability, since there are some cases (such as
the compact real form of G) for which there are no σG -invariant parabolic subgroups and,
therefore, such a stability condition would be trivially satisfied.
Remark 3.6. Let (E, ϕ, σE ) be a σ -real L-twisted Higgs pair. If the underlying Higgs pair
(E, ϕ) is α-stable (respectively, α-semistable), then (E, ϕ, σE ) is obviously α-stable (respectively, α-semistable).
3.3. Hermite–Einstein–Higgs equation. Let G be a connected reductive complex affine
algebraic group equipped with a real structure σG . Let K ⊂ G be a maximal compact
Lie subgroup preserved by the involution σG (see Proposition 2.1). Fix a non-degenerate
G-invariant bilinear form
B ∈ Sym2 (g∗ )G
which is

• positive on k = Lie(K), and
• compatible with dσG , meaning that (dσG )∗ B = B.
Let (X, σX ) be a compact Klein surface, and let ω be a σX -real Kähler form on X. Let
(L, σL ) be a real holomorphic line bundle over (X, σX ). Fix a σL –compatible Hermitian
metric hL on L. We denote by FL the curvature of the corresponding Chern connection on
L. Let V be a complex vector space equipped with a real structure σV , and let
ρ : G −→ GL(V)

(3.6)

be a (σG , σV )-real holomorphic representation. Let hV be a K-invariant Hermitian inner
product on the vector space V compatible with σV , meaning hV (σV (v), σV (v ′ )) = hV (v, v ′ )
for all v, v ′ ∈ V .

As above, take a holomorphic principal G-bundle E on X equipped with a real structure
σE . Let h be a σE –compatible reduction of the structure group of E from G to the subgroup
K (see Section 2.3). The resulting real K-bundle will be denoted by (EK , σEK ). Let
Ah ∈ A (EK , σEK )

be the unique σEK -connection on EK compatible with the holomorphic structure of E (see
Proposition 2.5). Let Fh ∈ Ω1,1 ((EK (k)) be the curvature of Ah .

The associated holomorphic vector bundle V := E(V) has a Hermitian structure hV
which is constructed using the reduction h and the Hermitian structure hV on V. Since hV
is K-invariant and compatible with σV , this Hermitian metric hV is in fact σV –compatible,
where σV is the real structure on V defined by σG and σV . Note that the Hermitian structure
hV ⊗L := hV ⊗ hL

on V ⊗ L is compatible with the involution σV ⊗ σL . The representation ρ in (3.6) induces

Now, the Hermitian structure hL on L identifies L with L (it is a C isomorphism), and

ϕ′′ ∈ C ∞ (X, V ⊗ V ∗ ) .

It is straightforward to check that the section ϕ′′ is pointwise Hermitian (same as self-adjoint),
meaning ϕ′′ (x) ∈ End(Vx ) is Hermitian for all x ∈ X.
To see that the section ϕ′′ is pointwise Hermitian, let W be a finite dimensional complex
vector space equipped with a Hermitian structure hW . Take any v ∈ W. Note that v
produces an endomorphism

defined by

Fv ∈ End(W) = W ⊗ W∗
Fv (z) := hW (z, v) · v

for all z ∈ W. Now for all z, w ∈ W, we have

hW (Fv (z), w) = hW (hW (z, v) · v, w) = hW (z, v) · hW (v, w)
= hW (w, v) · hW (z, v) = hW (z, hW (w, v) · v) = hW (z, Fv (w)) .

Consequently, Fv ∈ End(W) is Hermitian. This immediately implies that the section ϕ′′ in

4. Hitchin–Kobayashi correspondence for real Higgs pairs
The main result of the section, that we prove in the subsequent subsections, is the following.
Theorem 4.1 (Hitchin–Kobayashi correspondence). A σ -real L-twisted Higgs pair (E, ϕ, σE )
is α-polystable if and only if (E, ϕ, σE ) admits a σE -compatible Hermite–Einstein–Higgs reduction.
Corollary 4.2. A σ -real L-twisted Higgs pair (E, ϕ, σE ) is α-polystable if and only if the
underlying Higgs pair (E, ϕ) is α-polystable.
Proof of Corollary 4.2. If a L-twisted Higgs pair (E, ϕ) is α-polystable then (E, ϕ, σE ) is
α-polystable for any σ -real structure σE (see Remark 3.6).
For the opposite direction, in view of Theorem 4.1, it follows that the α-polystability of
a σ -real L-twisted Higgs pair (E, ϕ, σE ) is equivalent to the existence of a σE -compatible
solution of the Hermite–Einstein–Higgs equation (3.13). The existence of a solution of the
Hermite–Einstein–Higgs equation implies the polystability of the underlying L-twisted Higgs
pair, by the Hitchin–Kobayashi correspondence proved in [GGM1, Theorem 2.24].

4.1. Jordan–Hölder reduction. Let G be a connected reductive complex affine algebraic
group group, V a complex vector space and
ρ : G −→ GL(V)

(4.1)

a holomorphic representation. Let G′ ⊂ G be a complex algebraic subgroup. Let V′ be a
complex linear subspace of V such that the action of G′ on V, obtained by restricting the
action of G on V, preserves this subspace V′ . Let
ρ′ : G′ −→ GL(V′ )
be the restriction of ρ.
Take any holomorphic reduction of structure group E ′ ⊂ E to the subgroup G′ . Note that
the two holomorphic vector bundles E(V) and E ′ (V) are canonically identified. Therefore,
E ′ (V′ ) is a holomorphic subbundle of E(V).
Let (E, ϕ) be a L-twisted Higgs pair of type ρ. A reduction of structure group of
(E, ϕ), from (G, ρ) to (G′ , ρ′ ) is a L-twisted Higgs pair (E ′ , ϕ′ ) of type ρ′ , where
• E ′ is a reduction of structure group of E, from G to G′ , and
• ϕ′ ∈ H 0 (X, E ′ (V′ ) ⊗ L) is sent to ϕ by the homomorphism

reduction of structure group (E ′ , ϕ′ ) of (E, ϕ), from (G, ρ) to (G′ , ρ′ ), is σE -compatible if
the restriction σE |E ′ is a (σX , σG |G′ , c, σL , σV |V′ , ±)-real structure on (E ′ , ϕ′ ).
The main result of this subsection is the following:

Theorem 4.3 (Existence of a Jordan–Hölder reduction). Given a α-polystable σ -real Ltwisted Higgs pair (E, ϕ, σE ) that is not α-stable, there is a σE -compatible reduction of
structure (E ′ , ϕ′ ) of (E, ϕ) from (G, ρ) to (G′ , ρ′ ), such that G′ ⊂ G is a reductive complex
algebraic subgroup, and (E ′ , ϕ′ , σE |E ′ ) is α-stable.
Theorem 4.3 will be proved after proving Proposition 4.7.
To prove Theorem 4.3 we shall follow the approach in [GGM1, Sections 2.9, 2.10, 2.11],
checking that every construction done there is compatible with real structures. First, we
establish a relation between polystable σ -real L-twisted Higgs pairs, that are not stable, and
a certain space of automorphisms. This will be elaborated below.
Let
ad(E) = E(g) = E ×G g −→ X

be the holomorphic vector bundle associated to E for the adjoint action of G on its Lie
algebra g; so ad(E) is the adjoint vector bundle for E. Note that the fibers of ad(E) are Lie
algebras isomorphic to g. More precisely, any fiber E(g)x is identified with g uniquely up
to an inner automorphism of g. Since the fibers of ad(E) are Lie algebras, the vector space
H 0 (X, ad(E)) has the structure of a complex Lie algebra.
The involution σE of E and the involution dσG of g together define an anti-holomorphic
involution
σad(E) : ad(E) −→ ad(E) .

The space of infinitesimal automorphisms of a principal G-bundle EG is given by H 0(X, ad(E)).
In other words, H 0 (X, ad(E)) is the Lie algebra of the group of all holomorphic automorphisms of E. Hence the set of infinitesimal automorphism of a L-twisted Higgs pair (E, ϕ)
is given by
aut(E, ϕ) := {s ∈ H 0 (X, ad(E)) | ((dρ) ⊗ IdL )(s)(ϕ) = 0} ⊂ H 0 (X, ad(E)) ,
where dρ is the homomorphism of Lie algebras associated to ρ in (4.1); note that dρ induces
a homomorphism of associated bundles. It is straight-forward to check that aut(E, ϕ) is a
complex Lie subalgebra of H 0 (X, ad(E)).
Let
σaut : aut(E, ϕ) −→ aut(E, ϕ)

(4.3)

be the conjugate linear involution defined by

σaut (s)(σX (x)) := σad(E) (s(x))
for every s ∈ aut(E, ϕ) and x ∈ X, where σad(E) is the anti-holomorphic involution of the
adjoint bundle ad(E).
Note that given a section s ∈ H 0 (X, ad(E)), there is a unique Jordan decomposition
s = sss + sn ,
where
• sss (x) ∈ ad(E)x is semisimple for all x ∈ X while sn (x) is nilpotent, and
• sss (x) and sn (x) commute for all x ∈ X.

(4.4)

(See [BBN1], [BBN2]). Let
autss (E, ϕ) ⊂ aut(E, ϕ)
be the subspace consisting of all s1 ∈ aut(E, ϕ) such that s1 (x) ∈ ad(E)x is semisimple for
all x ∈ X. Therefore, we have
sss ∈ autss (E, ϕ) ,
where sss is the section in (4.4). In fact, if s ∈ aut(E, ϕ) with σaut (s) = s, then we have
sss ∈ autss (E, ϕ) with σaut (sss ) = sss .
Consider the Lie algebra aut(E, ϕ). Let

be a Cartan subalgebra such that
where σaut

C ⊂ aut(E, ϕ)

(4.5)

σaut (C) = C ,
is constructed in (4.3). Note that we have C ⊂ autss (E, ϕ).

This complex subalgebra C in (4.5) produces a Levi subgroup L(P ) ⊂ P of a parabolic
subgroup P ⊂ G, together with a holomorphic reduction of structure group of E
EL(P ) ⊂ E

to the Levi subgroup L(P ) [BP, p. 55, Proposition 1.2] (see also [BBN1], [BBN2]). We briefly
recall below the construction of the above pair (L(P ), EL(P ) ).
Take any element s ∈ C such that the complex subgroup of Aut(E) generated by
{exp(ts)}t∈C coincides with the subgroup generated by C; elements of C satisfying this condition form a nonempty Zariski open subset of C. Since the conjugacy classes of semisimple
elements in g is an affine variety, and X is compact, the condition that s(x) ∈ ad(E)x is
semisimple for all x ∈ X implies that the conjugacy class in g determined by the element
s(x) ∈ ad(E)x is independent of x. Fix an element s0 ∈ g in this conjugacy class. Then
L(P ) ⊂ is the centralizer, in G, of s0 for the adjoint action of G. Let
C(s) ⊂ Ad(E)

(4.6)

EL(P ) ⊂ E

(4.7)

be the sub-group scheme whose fiber over any x ∈ X is the centralizer, in Ad(E)x , of s(x)
for the adjoint action on the Lie algebra; since the conjugacy class of s(x) is independent of
x ∈ X, it follows that C(s) is indeed a sub-group scheme of Ad(E). Also, recall that Ad(E)
is a quotient of E × G, where two points (z1 , g1 ), (z2 , g2 ) ∈ E × G are identified if there is
g ∈ G such that z2 = z1 g and g2 = g −1g1 g. The complex submanifold
is the locus of all point z ∈ E such that the image of (z, g) ∈ E × L(P ) in the quotient
space Ad(E) lies in C(s).

Now choose s ∈ C as above satisfying the extra condition that σaut (s) = s (as before,
impose the condition that the subgroup of Aut(E) generated by {exp(ts)}t∈C coincides with
the subgroup generated by C); since the subspace C σaut ⊂ C fixed by σaut is Zariski dense in
C, such an element s exists. Choose the above element s0 ∈ g such that dσG (s0 ) = s0 . This
condition implies that σG (L(P )) = L(P ) (the parabolic subgroup P associated to L(P ) is
not unique, and P need not be preserved by σG ). The antiholomorphic involution σE of E and
the antiholomorphic involution σG of G together produce an antiholomorphic involution of
E ×G. This involution descends to an antiholomorphic involution of Ad(E). Since σaut (s) =
s, the sub-group scheme C(s) in (4.6) is preserved by this antiholomorphic involution of

REAL HIGGS PAIRS AND NON-ABELIAN HODGE CORRESPONDENCE

21

Ad(E). Consequently, EL(P ) in (4.7) is preserved by the antiholomorphic involution σE of
E.
We note that the condition that (dρ⊗IdL )(s)(ϕ) = 0, for all s ∈ C, implies that (EL(P ) , ϕ)
is, in fact, a reduction of structure group of (E, ϕ).
Let
z ⊂ g
be the center of g, so z is the Lie algebra of Z. Let
E(z) := E ×G z

be the vector bundle associated to E for the adjoint action of G on z. Since the adjoint
action of G on z is trivial, we have E(z) := X × z. Also, note that
E(z) ⊂ ad(E)

is the fiberwise center of the Lie algebra bundle ad(E).
While the infinitesimal automorphisms of (E, ϕ) are parameterized by aut(E, ϕ), the
infinitesimal automorphisms of the triple (E, ϕ, σE ) constitute the subspace
aut(E, ϕ, σE ) = aut(E, ϕ)σaut := {s ∈ aut(E, ϕ) | σaut (s) = s} ,

where σaut is the real involution of aut(E, ϕ) in (4.3). Therefore, we have
H 0 (X, E(z))σad(E) = H 0(X, E(z)) ∩ aut(E, ϕ, σE ) ;

note that the involution σad(E) in (4.2) induces an involution of H 0 (X, ad(E)) (also denoted
by σad(E) ), and the subspace H 0 (X, E(z)) ⊂ H 0 (X, ad(E)) is preserved by σad(E) .
Proposition 4.4. Let (E, ϕ, σE ) be a σ -real L-twisted Higgs pair. If (E, ϕ, σE ) is α-stable
then
aut(E, ϕ, σE ) = H 0 (X, E(z))σad(E) .
(4.8)
Assume that (E, ϕ, σE ) is α-polystable. Then (E, ϕ, σE ) is α-stable if and only if
autss (E, ϕ, σE ) = H 0 (X, E(z))σad(E) .

(4.9)

Proof. We will start proving the second part, assuming the first part. The first part will be
proved subsequently.
Assume that (E, ϕ, σE ) is α-polystable. If (E, ϕ, σE ) is α-stable, then the first part of
the proposition implies that autss (E, ϕ, σE ) = H 0 (X, E(z))σad(E) , since any section s ∈
H 0 (X, E(z)) is pointwise semisimple. Note that H 0 (X, E(z)) = z, because H 0 (X, E(z)), as
noted before, is the trivial holomorphic vector bundle on X with fiber z. The σad(E) -invariant
part H 0 (X, E(z))σad(E) ⊂ H 0 (X, E(z)) coincides with zdσG , where dσG is, as above, the
involution of g induced by σG .
On the other hand, if (E, ϕ, σE ) is not α-stable, then for any reduction
as in (3.5), consider the subbundle

ELs ⊂ EPs ⊂ E
Z(ELs ) ⊂ ad(ELs )

defined by the centers of the fibers of the adjoint bundle ad(ELs ) of ELs ; so for any x ∈ X,
the fiber Z(ELs )x is the center of the Lie algebra ad(ELs )x . Note that Z(ELs ) is a trivial

22

I. BISWAS, L. A. CALVO, AND O. GARCÍA-PRADA

vector bundle on X whose fibers are identified with the center zLs of the Lie algebra of the
Levi subgroup Ls . Moreover,
zLs = H 0 (X, Z(ELs )) ⊂ H 0 (X, ad(ELs )) ⊂ aut(E, ϕ) ,

and the automorphism σaut of aut(E, ϕ) preserves the above subspaces H 0 (X, ad(ELs )) and
H 0 (X, Z(ELs )); in fact, the action of σaut on H 0 (X, Z(ELs )) coincides with the action of
dσG on zLs . The vector space H 0 (X, Z(ELs )) is strictly larger than H 0 (X, E(z)), because
Ps is a proper parabolic subgroup of G (recall that (E, ϕ, σE ) is α-polystable but not αstable). Also, every element s ∈ Z(ELs ) is pointwise semisimple. These together imply that
H 0 (X, Z(ELs ))σad(E) is strictly larger than H 0(X, E(z))σad(E) . This proves the second part
of the proposition assuming the first part.
To prove the first part of the proposition, we first note that
H 0 (X, E(z))σad(E) ⊂ aut(E, ϕ, σE ) ,

because H 0 (X, E(z)) ⊂ aut(E, ϕ).
Let (E, ϕ, σE ) be a σ -real L-twisted Higgs pair which is α-stable.
First assume that
autss (E, ϕ, σE ) \ H 0 (X, E(z))σad(E) 6= ∅ .
(4.10)
ss
ss
Take an element s ∈ aut (E, ϕ, σE ) that generates a Cartan subalgebra of aut (E, ϕ). As
we saw in (4.7), this section s produces a reduction of structure group
E(Ls ) ⊂ E

of E to a Levi subgroup Ls ⊂ G which satisfies the following two conditions:
(1) E(Ls ) is a reduction of structure group of (E, ϕ), and
(2) σE (E(Ls )) = E(Ls ).

From the assumption in (4.10) it follows that the conjugacy class in g determined by s does
not lie in z. Consequently, Ls ( G is a proper parabolic subgroup.
The reduction E(Ls ) ⊂ E thus contradicts the given condition that (E, ϕ, σE ) is α-stable.
In view of this contradiction, we conclude that
autss (E, ϕ, σE ) = H 0 (X , E(z))σad(E) .
To complete the proof we need to show that aut(E, ϕ, σE ) does not have any nonzero
nilpotent element.
Let s ∈ aut(E, ϕ, σE ) be a nonzero nilpotent element. This defines a parabolic subalgebra
bundle
P ⊂ ad(E)
(4.11)
constructed as follows. Since there are only finitely many conjugacy classes of nilpotent
elements of g, there is a open subset U ⊂ X such that
• X \ U is a finite subset, and
• the conjugacy class in g determined by s(x) ∈ ad(E)x is independent of x ∈ U.

Take any x ∈ U. Let n1 ⊂ ad(E)x be the normalizer of C · s(x), and let r1 be the
nilpotent radical of n1 . Now inductively define ni+1 to be the normalizer of ri in ad(E)x
and define ri+1 to be the nilpotent radical of ni+1 . Now {nj }j≥1 is an increasing sequence

of subspaces that converges to a parabolic subalgebra of ad(E)x (see [AB, p. 340, Lemma
3.7]). This way we obtain a parabolic subalgebra bundle
P ′ ⊂ ad(E)|U

over U. Since the conjugates of a parabolic subalgebra in a complex reductive algebra are
parameterized by a complete variety (conjugates of a parabolic subalgebra Lie(P ) ⊂ g are
parameterized by G/P which is a complete variety), the above subalgebra bundle P ′ extends
to a parabolic subalgebra bundle P over X (as in (4.11)); see the proof of Proposition 3.9
in [AB]. It is straight-forward to check that this subalgebra bundle P contradicts the given
condition that (E, ϕ, σE ) is α-stable. This proves the proposition.

The following two lemmas correspond to [GGM1, Lemma 2.16] and [GGM1, Lemma 2.17]
respectively. Note that here we only consider reductions of structure group that are compatible with the real structure.
Lemma 4.5. Let (E, σE ) be a (σX , σG , c)-real G-bundle over (X, σX ). Let G′ be a Lie subgroup of G such that the Lie algebra g′ = Lie(G′ ) has the following property: The normalizer
NG (g′ ) ⊂ G for the adjoint action of G on g is G′ itself. The reductions EG′ ⊂ E of structure group of E from G to G′ such that
(4.12)

σAd(E) (Ad(EG′ )) = Ad(EG′ ) ,

are in one-to-one correspondence with subbundles F ⊂ ad(E) of Lie algebras satisfying the
following two conditions:
(1) σad(E) (F ) = F , and
(2) for any x ∈ X and any trivialization Ex ≃ G of the fiber Ex (obtaining by fixing an
element of Ex ), the subalgebra Fx ⊂ ad(E)x is conjugate to g′ , via the trivialization
ad(E)x ≃ g induced by the trivialization of Ex .
Proof. It is a consequence of [GGM1, Lemma 2.16] and the fact that equation (4.12) is
equivalent to the above condition (1) on F .

Let P ⊂ G be a parabolic subgroup. Let EP ⊂ E be a holomorphic reduction of structure
group such that
σAd(E) (Ad(EP )) = Ad(EP ) .
(4.13)
Let LP ⊂ P be a Levi subgroup of P , and let U ⊂ P be the unipotent radical. The Lie
algebras of LP , P and U will be denoted by l, p and u respectively. Let
EL ⊂ EP
be a holomorphic reduction of the structure group of EP from P to LP , such that
(4.14)

σAd(E) (Ad(EL )) = Ad(EL ) .

Conditions (4.13) and (4.14) imply that σad(E) = d(σAd(E) ) preserves all three subbundles
EP (u), EP (p) and EP (l) of ad(E). Denote by σEP (u) , σEP (p) and σEP (l) the real structures
on EP (u), EP (p) and EP (l) respectively induced by σad(E) . There is a short exact sequence

Note that (4.15) is a short exact sequence of Lie algebra bundles, and all the homomorphisms
in (4.15) are Lie algebra structure preserving. A Lie algebra bundle (right) splitting of (4.15)
is a homomorphism of Lie algebra bundles f : EP (l) −→ EP (p) such that the composition
of homomorphisms
f

EP (l) −→ EP (p) −→ EP (l)
coincides with the identity map of EP (l), where EP (p) −→ EP (l) is the projection in (4.15).
If
f ◦ σEP (l) = σEP (p) ◦ f ,
then the splitting f is called (σEP (l) , σEP (p) )-real.
Lemma 4.6. Let EP ⊂ E be a holomorphic reduction of structure group to P satisfying
(4.13). Reductions EL of the structure group of EP from from P to LP satisfying (4.14)
are in a natural bijective correspondence with the holomorphic Lie algebra bundle (right)
splittings of the exact sequence in (4.15) that are (σEP (l) , σEP (p) )-real.
Proof. Setting G = P and G′ = LP in Lemma 4.5, we conclude that the space of reductions
of structure group of EP from P to LP satisfying (4.14) is in bijective correspondence with
subbundles F ⊂ EP (p) such that σad(E) (F ) = F and Fx is conjugate to l , once we identify
EP (p)x with p for any x ∈ X, by fixing an element of (EP )x .

Let (E, ϕ, σE ) be a α-polystable σ -real L-twisted Higgs pair that is not α-stable. From
Proposition 4.4 it follows that there exists a non-central element η ∈ aut(E, ϕ, σE ), in other
words there exists η ∈ H 0 (X, E([g, g])) such that
σaut (η) = η .

There is an element

√
u := ur + −1ui ∈ [g, g] ,
where ur , ui ∈ k = Lie(K) and [ur , ui ] = 0, such that η(x) ∈ E([g, g])x lies in the
conjugacy class of u for every x ∈ X; as before, K is a maximal
√ compact subgroup of G
preserved by σG (see Proposition 2.1). This element u := ur + −1ui satisfies the equation
dσG (u) = u. Let a ∈ [k, k] be an infinitesimal generator of the torus generated by ui and
ur . Then, a also satisfies the equation dσG a = a. Furthermore, the subgroup
K1 := ZK (a) = {h ∈ K | Ad(h)a = a}

is preserved by σG , because K is preserved by σG . We denote by G1 the complexification K1C
and by σG1 the restriction σG |K1C . The section η ∈ H 0 (X, ad(E)) induces a G-equivariant
map
φη : E −→ g
which is also (σE , dσG )-real, because σaut (η) = η. Therefore, we conclude that
E1 := { e ∈ E | φη (e) = u}

is preserved by σE , and E1 is a (σX , σG1 , c)-real principal G1 -bundle. Since ρ is a (σG , σV )compatible representation, the complex vector subspace
V1 := {v ∈ V | ρ(a)v = 0}

is equipped with a real structure σV1 = σV |V1 , and
ρ1 := ρ|K1

REAL HIGGS PAIRS AND NON-ABELIAN HODGE CORRESPONDENCE

25

is a (σG1 , σV1 )-compatible representation.
Proposition 4.7. The above (σX , σG1 , c, σL , σV1 , ±)-real L-twisted Higgs pair
(E1 , ϕ1 := ϕ|E1 , σE1 := σE |E1 )

is α-polystable.

Proof. First, we shall prove
√ that (E1 , ϕ1 , σE1 ) is α-semistable. We denote by k1 the Lie
algebra of K1 . For s ∈ −1 k1 , consider the parabolic subgroup
P1,s := {g ∈ G1 | ets ge−ts is bounded when t → ∞} ,

and the Levi subgroup

L1,s := {g ∈ P1,s | Ad(g)s = s} .
Any holomorphic reduction of structure group σ1 of E1 to P1,s such that
σAd(E) (AdEP1,s ) = AdEP1,s
can be extended to a real reduction of structure group σ to Ps such that
σAd(E) (AdEPs ) = AdEPs .
Moreover, we have
deg E(σ, s) = deg E1 (σ1 , s) .
Therefore, using the given condition that (E, ϕ, σE ) is α-semistable it is deduced that
(E1 , ϕ1 , σE1 ) is also α-semistable.
√
From Lemma 4.6, it follows that (E1 , ϕ1 , σE1 ) is α-polystable if for every s ∈ −1k,
and for every holomorphic reduction of structure group σ of E1 to Ps that satisfies the two
conditions σAd(E1 ) (AdEP1,s ) = AdEP1,s and
deg E1 (σ1 , s) − B(s, α) = 0 ,

there is a real splitting ω1 of the following exact sequence of real vector bundles
0
//

( E1σ1 (u1 ), σE1 σ1 (u1 ) )
//

( E1σ1 (p1 ), σE1 σ1 (p1 ) )
//

( E1σ1 (l1 ), σE1 σ1 (l1 ) )
//

0.

The argument for the existence of the splitting is identical to the argument for the non-real
case. (See [GGM1, Proposition 2.18] for details).
On the other hand, we have ϕ ∈ H 0 (X, ELs (V0s ) ⊗ L) if and only if
ρ(ω(ψσ,s (ϕ))) = 0 ,

where ω is a splitting of (4.15) and ψσ1 ,s ∈ H 0 (X, Eσ (p)) is the section which is equal to s
on the fibers. By the same reasoning, ϕ1 ∈ H 0 (X, E1 L1,s (V1 ) ⊗ L) if and only if
ρ(ω1 (ψσ1 ,s (ϕ))) = 0 ,

(4.16)

where ψσ1 ,s ∈ H 0 (X, E1 σ1 (p1 )) is the section which is equal to s on the fibers. If we
decompose p and l, using characters η ∈ Hom(T, S 1 ), where T ⊂ H is a maximal torus,
then ω1 is the restriction of ω, which corresponds to setting η = 1.
Since (E, ϕ) is α-polystable, we have ϕ ∈ H 0 (X, ELs (V0s ) ⊗ L). As noted before, this
implies that ρ(ω(ψσ,s (ϕ))) = 0 and hence (4.16) holds. It was observed earlier that
if (4.16) holds.

Proof of Theorem 4.3. From Proposition 4.7, we obtain a σE -compatible reduction of structure group of a polystable σ -real L-twisted Higgs pair (E, ϕ, σE ) from (G, ρ) to a subgroup
(K1C , ρ1 ) with real structure, where K1C ( G. We can iterate this process and finally, within
a finite number n of steps, we obtain a σE -compatible holomorphic reduction of structure
group (En , ϕn ) of (E, ϕ) from (G, ρ) to (KnC , ρn ), where KnC is a Levi subgroup of G and

(En , ϕn , σE |En ) is α-stable. This proves Theorem 4.3.
Remark 4.8. The uniqueness of the Jordan–Hölder reduction (up to conjugation) follows
immediately from the uniqueness in the usual (with no real structures) case (see [GGM1,
Proposition 2.20]).
4.2. Stability implies the existence of solution. In this section, we prove one implication of Theorem 4.1 for σ -real L-twisted G-Higgs pairs (E, ϕ, σE ) that are α-stable.
Let E be a C ∞ principal G-bundle over X equipped with a (σX , σG , c)-real structure σE
(see Section 2.2). Let h be a σE -compatible C ∞ reduction of structure group of E from G to
the maximal compact subgroup K. By Proposition 2.5, there is a bijective correspondence
between σE -compatible connections on EK and σE -real complex structures on E. As a consequence, after fixing a σL -compatible U(1)-connection on L, we conclude that the space of
all σ -real L-twisted Higgs pairs (E, ϕ, σE ) such that the underlying C ∞ -bundle to E is E is
in bijective correspondence with the space of all triples (σE , A, ϕ) such that
• σE is a (σX , σG , c)-real structure on E,
• A is a σE -compatible connection on EK , and
• ϕ is a holomorphic section of E(V) ⊗ L satisfying

∗
σV ⊗ σL (ϕ) = ±σX
(ϕ) ,

where σV is the involution of V = E(V) induced by σE and σV , and σL is the fixed
involution on L. Here, abusing notation, we are denoting L and its underlying smooth
line bundle in the same way.
We will denote by T the set of triples (σE , A, ϕ) satisfying the above conditions.
Let A be the space of connections on EK . Let S be the space of all C ∞ sections of V ⊗ L.
The product space
X := A × S

group
K = Ω0 (EK (K)) .

on k. Let h , i be the bilinear form on Lie(K ) induced by B, where K is constructed in

Definition 4.10. Let E be a holomorphic principal G-bundle X, and let h be a C ∞ reduction
of structure group of E from G to K. Let A be the Chern connection on the principal
√ Kbundle Eh , given by h, corresponding to the holomorphic structure on E. Take s ∈ −1k,
and let σ be a holomorphic reduction of structure group of E from G√ to Ps , where Ps is
the parabolic subgroup of G defined by s. The section ψh,σ,s ∈ Ω0 (Eh ( −1k)) is defined as
follows: the reduction σ defines a holomorphic map
ξ : Eh −→ G/Ps .

If e ∈ Eh , then ξ(e) = P is a parabolic subgroup of G conjugate to Ps . From [GGM1,

reduction of structure group of E from G to K. Let (σE , A, ϕ) ∈ T be the triple corresponding to (E, ϕ, σE ). Let σ be a holomorphic reduction of structure group of E from G to

where ψh,σ,s ∈ Ω0 (Eh ( −1k)) is constructed above.

weight of (A, ϕ). Therefore, it suffices to prove the proposition by forgetting real structures.

Lemma 4.2] we know that for the Hamiltonian action of K on A , the maximal
weight λ(A, − −1ψσ,s ) is equal to
λr deg(E(V)) +

r−1
X
k=1

(λk − λk−1) deg(E(V)λk ).

(4.25)

Equation (4.25) coincides with one of the different ways to calculate deg E(σ, s) defined in
equation (3.3) (see [GGM1, Lemma 2.12 (3)]).
Now, in a similar way, we can extend the Hamiltonian action of K on A × S to prove
the proposition (see [Mu1, Lemma 4.3]).

Let G = Ω0 (E(G)) be the gauge group of E. The real structures σX and σG together
induce an involution σG on G . Since σG preserves K, it follows that σG restricts to an
involution σK on K . By abuse of notation, we denote also by σG the involution on G /K
and the involution on Lie(G ).
A triple (σE , A, ϕ) ∈ T is called simple if there is no semisimple element u ∈ Lie(G )
such that
• u is invariant under√σLie(G , and
• hdµα (A, ϕ), ui , − −1u = 0.
Theorem 4.12. Take any α ∈ z(k). Fix a simple σ -real triple (σE , A, ϕ). There is an
element s ∈ G /K such that
(1) σG (s) = s, and
(2) the function Ψα in (4.21) attains its minimum at s.
Theorem 4.12 will be proved after proving Proposition 4.14.
Fix from now on p > 2. Let (σE , A, ϕ) be a simple triple whose corresponding σ -real
Higgs pair is α-stable. We define
√
Metp2 := Lp2 (E( −1 k)
√
to be the completion of Ω0 (E( −1 k)) with respect to the Sobolev norm
kskLp2 = kskLp + kdA skLp + k∇dA skLp ,

where dA s is the covariant derivative of s with respect to A, and

∇ : Ω0 (T ∗ X ⊗ ad(E)) −→ Ω1 (T ∗ X ⊗ ad(E))

√
is the tensor product of the Levi–Civita connection and dA . Note that Ω0 (E( −1 k)) is
actually isomorphic to G /K using the exponential map. Let C be a positive real number.
Consider the bounded metric space
Metp2 C := {s ∈ Metp2 | kµα (es (A, ϕ))kpLp ≤ C} .

Proposition 4.13. If a metric minimizes Ψα in Metp2 C , then it also minimizes Ψα in Metp2 .
Proof. Suppose that s ∈ Metp2 C is a minimum of Ψα . Let B = es (A) and Θ = es (ϕ). We
define the differential operator

√
for every u ∈ Lp2 (E( −1k)).

By [Br, Lemma 3.4.2], it suffices to prove that Ker(L) = 0, because if s minimizes Ψα
and Ker(L) = 0, then µ(B, Θ) = 0, and by Remark 4.9, one has that s minimizes Ψα on
Metp2 .
We prove that Ker(L) = 0, by contradiction. Let 0 6= u ∈ Ker(L). Therefore, the
u+σLie(G ) (u)
element
also lies in Ker(L). Then we have

− −1 L(

2

From [Mu2, Equation 2.13] it follows that u+σ2G (u) leaves (B, Θ) invariant. Consequently,
(σE , B, Θ) is not simple and hence (σE , A, ϕ) is not simple. In view of this contradiction
we conclude that Ker(L) = 0.

Proposition 4.14. There exist positive constants C1 and C2 such that
sup |s| ≤ C1 Ψα ((A, ϕ), es ) + C2

for every s ∈ Metp2 C .

Proof. The given condition that p > 2 implies that Lp2 ֒→ C 0 , which follows from the
Sobolev embedding theorem, and it makes sense to consider sup |s|. Repeating the same
arguments as in [Mu1, Section 6], it suffices to prove that
kskL1 ≤ C1 Ψα ((A, ϕ), es ) + C2 .

(4.26)

To prove (4.26) by contradiction, suppose that C1 , C2 satisfying (4.26) do not exist. Then
it can be shown that there is a sequence {ui } ∈ Metp2 C converging weakly to some
u∞ ∈ Metp2 C ,

such that
λα ((A, ϕ), u∞ ) ≤ 0 .

(4.27)

Indeed, following [Mu2, Lemma 2.5.4], if C1 , C2 do not exist, then there is a sequence of real
numbers {Cj } and a sequence {sj } of metrics in Metp2 B such that
lim Cj = ∞ and ksj kL1 ≥ Cj Ψα ((A, ϕ), esj ) .

j→∞

Let lj := ksj kL1 and uj :=

lj

then kuj kL1 = 1 and sup |uj | ≤ Cj .

Passing√to a subsequence if necessary, we can suppose that {uj } converge to an u∞ , weakly
on L21 (E( −1k)), and λα ((A, ϕ), u∞ ) ≤ 0. From the definition of the integral of the moment
map we have the following:

These inequalities together imply that k∂ A (uj )k is bounded, so there is a subsequence {uj }
converging to u∞ . In addition, we have
√
λα ((A, ϕ), u∞ ) ≤ lim λαt ((A, ϕ), − −1uj ) ≤ 0 .
t→∞

The subsequence {σG (ui )} ∈

Metp2 C

converges weakly to σG u∞ ∈ Metp2 C , and

λα ((A, ϕ), σG (u∞ )) ≤ 0 .

(4.28)

The partial sums of subsequences { ui +σ2G (ui ) } converge to
u′∞ =

u′∞ + σG (u′∞ )
∈ Metp2 C
2

and this element is invariant under σG . Then ρ(u′∞ ) has real constant eigenvalues. The
filtration V (u′∞ ) induces a holomorphic reduction of structure group σ from G to P such
that EP = σE (EP ), and therefore σAd(E) (AdEPs ) = AdEPs . Since by hypothesis (E, ϕ) is
α-stable, it follows that
deg E(σ, s) + B(α, s) > 0 .
In view of Proposition 4.11, this inequality contradicts (4.27), completing the proof.

Proof of Theorem 4.12. To prove Theorem 4.12, let {si } be a minimizing sequence for Ψα ,
then
si + σG (si )

{s′i } = {

suitable subsequence, we can suppose that {s′i } converges weakly to some s′ , invariant under
σG , that minimize Ψα .

Theorem 4.15. Let (E, ϕ, σE ) be a α-stable σ -real L-twisted G-Higgs pair. Then there is
a σE -compatible C ∞ reduction of structure group h from G to K satisfying (3.13).
Proof. Fix a σE -compatible C ∞ reduction of structure group of E from G to K. Let
(σE , A, ϕ) ∈ T
be the triple associated to (E, ϕ, σE ). The existence of a σE -compatible C ∞ reduction of
structure group h of E from G to K satisfying (3.13) is equivalent to the existence of a
σE -compatible pair (A′ , ϕ′ ) satisfying the equation
µα (A′ , ϕ′ ) = 0 ,

(4.29)

where µα is defined in (4.18).
From Remark 4.9 we know that fixing a σE -compatible pair (A, ϕ) in equation (4.21),

(A, ϕ) is a solution of (4.29).

Finally, since (E, ϕ, σE ) is α-stable, it follows that (σE , A, ϕ) is simple (see Proposition 4.4
and [Mu1, Definition 3.8]), and hence we can apply Theorem 4.12 to complete the proof. 

4.3. Polystability implies the existence of a solution. In this section, and in the next
one we prove Theorem 4.1.
Let (E, ϕ, σE ) be a α-polystable σ -real L-twisted Higgs pair. If (E, ϕ, σE ) is α-stable
then it admits a σE -compatible Hermite-Einstein-Higgs reduction (see Theorem 4.15). If
(E, ϕ, σE ) is not α-stable, by the Jordan-Hölder reduction (Theorem 4.3) we obtain a
(σX , σG |G′ , c, σL , σV |V′ , ±)-real Higgs pair (E ′ , ϕ′ , σE |E ′ ) that is α-stable, then, by the pre′ ′
′
′
vious case, it admits a σE ′ -compatible reduction of structure of (EK
′ , ϕK ′ ) from (G , ρ ) to
′
′
(K , ρ|K ) satisfying (3.13). This reduction defines another reduction (EK , ϕK ) of (E, ϕ)
from (G, ρ) to (K, ρ|K), that, with respect to the structure group, is given by
′
EK = EK ′ ×K ′ K = EK
′ ×K ′ K

and with respect to the Higgs field, ϕK is the image of ϕ′K ′ under the homomorphism

H 0 (X, EK

// EK (VK ) , where V′ and VK are complex vector
induced by the injection EK

K
spaces such that ρ(K ′ ) = GL(VK ′ ) and ρ(K) = GL(VK ), respectively. Since the reduction
′
(EK
, ϕ′K ′ ) is σE ′ -compatible and it is Hermite Einstein Higgs, then one can see that the
reduction (EK , ϕK ) is also σE -compatible and it is Hermite-Einstein-Higgs, in other words,
it satisfies Equation (3.13).


4.4. Existence of a solution implies polystability.
Proposition 4.16 (Existence of a solution implies semistability). Assume that there exist a σE -compatible Hermite–Einstein–Higgs reduction h of a σ -real L-twisted Higgs pair
(E, ϕ, σE ). Then (E, ϕ, σE ) is α-semistable.
Proof. Suppose that (E, ϕ, σE ) is not α-semistable. Then, there is a holomorphic reduction
σ of structure group of E from G to Ps such that σAd(E) (AdEPs ) = AdEPs and
deg E(s, σ) − B(s, α) < 0 .

(4.30)

From Proposition 4.11, one has that

√
λα ( (A, ϕ) , −1ψh,σ,s ) < 0 .

(4.31)
√
By hypothesis h is Hermite-Einstein-Higgs,
then λα0 ( (A, ϕ) , −1ǫh,σ,s ) = 0. (See Equation
√
α
4.19). Since λt ( (A, ϕ) , −1ψh,σ,s ) is a non decreasing sequence, it follows that
√
λα ( (A, ϕ) , −1ψh,σ,s ) ≥ 0
and this contradicts (4.31).



Proposition 4.17 (Existence of solutions implies polystability). Assume that there exist a σE -compatible Hermite–Einstein–Higgs reduction h of a σ -real L-twisted Higgs pair
(E, ϕ, σE ). Then (E, ϕ, σE ) is α-polystable.
√
Proof. Let h be a σE -compatible Hermite–Einstein–Higgs reduction. Take s ∈ −1k, and
let σ be any reduction of structure group from G to Ps , such that σAd(E) (AdEPs ) = AdEPs .
Since h is σE -compatible,
σE (Eh ) = Eh ,

Eh ( −1k) such that the associated reductive filtrations V (ψh,σ,s ) and V (ψh,σ,σG s ) (see equation (4.24)) are related in the following way: they define reductions EP and σE (EP ) that
satisfy σAd(E) (AdEPs ) = AdEPs .
The σ -real Higgs pair (E, ϕ, σE ) is α-semistable by Proposition 4.16. Let σ be a reduction
of structure group of E from G to Ps such that σAd(E) (AdEPs ) = AdEPs as well as

deg E(s, σ) − B(s, α) = 0 .

(4.34)

Let A be the connection on Eh that corresponds to the holomorphic structure on E. From
Proposition 4.11 and (4.34), it follows that
√
(4.35)
λα ( (A, ϕ) , −1ψh,σ,s ) = 0 .
√
Since h is an √
Hermite-Einstein-Higgs reduction, then λα0 ( (A, ϕ) , −1ψ
√h,σ,s ) = 0 and
α
α
since λt ( (A, ϕ) , −1ψh,σ,s ) is a non-decreasing sequence, then λt ( (A, ϕ) , −1ψh,σ,s ) = 0,
for all t. This implies that etψh,σ,s fix A, for any t. Therefore, the filtration V (ψh,σ,s ) induces
tψ′
a reduction of the structure group of EPs from Ps to Ls . Analogously, e h,σ,σG s fixes σA A,
for any t, where σA is the real structure induced in the space of connections by σE and σX .

The filtration V (ψh,σ,σ
) induce a reductions of the structure group of σE (EPs ) from σG Ps
Gs
to σG Ls . Both reductions are related by
σAd(E) (Ad(ELs )) = Ad(ELs ) .
The element etǫh,σ,s fixes also ϕ for any t. This implies that ϕ ∈ H 0 (X, ELs (V0s ) ⊗ L). This
completes the proof.

5. Real Higgs bundles and the non-abelian Hodge correspondence
Let GR be a semisimple real form of a connected complex semisimple Lie group G defined
by a conjugation µ ∈ Conj(G). Let τ ∈ Conj(G), commuting with µ and defining a
compact real form K ⊂ G. The subgroup H R := K ∩ GR defines a maximal compact
subgroup of GR . Let gR = hR ⊕ mR be the Cartan decomposition of gR , the Lie algebra of
GR , where hR is the Lie algebra of H R and mR is its orthogonal complement with respect to
the Killing form. Let H and m be the complexifications of H R and mR , respectively. Let σG
be a (µ, τ )-compatible conjugation of G (see Example 2.3). By abuse of notation, we denote

REAL HIGGS PAIRS AND NON-ABELIAN HODGE CORRESPONDENCE

33

by σG the restriction to H and the restriction of dσG to m. Then the isotropy representation
ι : H −→ GL(m) is (σG , σG )-compatible (see Example 2.3).

Let (X, σX ) be a compact Klein surface, and let KX be the canonical bundle of X. The
anti-holomorphic involution σX induces a real structure σKX on KX .

5.1. Real GR -Higgs bundles and Hitchin equations. Let Z(H) be the centers H and
Z(H)σ2 G be the subgroup of elements of Z(H) of order two that are invariant under σG . Set
ZισG := Z(H)σ2 G ∩ ker(ι)

(5.1)

and let c ∈ ZισG . A (σX , σG , c, ±)-real GR -Higgs bundle is a (σX , σG , c, dσG , σKX , ±)-real
KX -twisted H C -Higgs-pair of type ι. Set σ = (σX , σG , c, ±). Sometimes we will refer to
these objects as σ -real G-Higgs bundles.
√
Let z(h) be the center of h and α ∈
−1h ∩ z(h). The notions of α-stability, αsemistability and α-polystability in Section 3.2 apply to σ -real GR -Higgs bundles. Since
we are mostly interested in the relation of these objects to representations of the fundamental group of X we will take α = 0 and will refer to 0-stability simply as stability (the same
for semistability and polystability).
Denote by M(GR , σX , σG , c, ±) the moduli space of isomorphism classes of polystable
(σX , σG , c, ±)-real GR -Higgs bundles. We may fix the topological type d ∈ π1 (H) ∼
= π1 (H R ),
and consider the subvariety Md (GR , σX , σG , c, ±).
Let (E, ϕ, σE ) be a σ -real GR -Higgs bundle over (X, σX ). Let h be a σE -compatible
reduction of the structure group of E from H to H R , and let
τh : Ω1,0 (E(m)) −→ Ω0,1 (E(m))

(5.2)

be the map defined by the compact conjugation τ in the fibers induced by h combined with
complex conjugation on complex 1-forms.
Choose a σX -compatible Kähler form on X as defined in Section 2.2. This defines a σKX compatible metric on KX . Taking α = 0, one can show that the Hermite–Einstein–Higgs
equation (3.13) coincides in this particular case with the Hitchin equation
Fh − [ϕ, τh (ϕ)] = 0 .

(5.3)

As a particular case of Theorem 4.1 one thus has the following.
Theorem 5.1. A σ -real GR -Higgs bundle (E, ϕ, σE ) is polystable if and only if there exists
a σE -compatible reduction h of the structure group of E from H to H R satisfying (5.3).
And Corollary 4.2 gives now the following.
Corollary 5.2. A σ -real GR -Higgs bundle (E, ϕ, σE ) is polystable if and only if the underlying GR -Higgs bundle (E, ϕ) is polystable.
From the point of view of moduli spaces it is convenient to look at the Hitchin equation
from a different but equivalent point of view (see [GGM1]). To explain this, fix a C ∞
principal H-bundle EH and a reduction h to a H R -bundle EH R ⊂ EH . We are then looking
for a connection A on EH R and a smooth section ϕ ∈ Ω1,0 (X, EH (m)). The Hitchin equations
become then

34

I. BISWAS, L. A. CALVO, AND O. GARCÍA-PRADA

FA − [ϕ, τh (ϕ)] = 0
∂ Aϕ = 0 .

(5.4)

Here dA is the covariant derivative associated to A, and ∂ A is the (0, 1) part of dA .
Let Mgauge (GR ) be the space of solutions (A, ϕ) to (5.4) modulo the gauge group H R of
EH R . Recall (see [GGM1]) that, if d ∈ π1 (H) is the topological class of EH , and Md (GR ) is
the moduli space of GR -Higgs bundles, then there is a homeomorphism
(5.5)
Mgauge (GR ) ∼
= Md (GR ).
Now, if we are equipped with conjugations σX and σG and c ∈ ZισG , as at the beginning
of Section 5, we can consider a (σX , σG , c)-real structure σEH on EH , which, if the reduction
h is chosen to be σEH -compatible, it will restrict to σEH R on EH R .
Let T ± be the set triples (σEH , A, ϕ), where A is σEH R -compatible and ϕ satisfies (3.2),
which in this case is
∗
σV ⊗ σKX (ϕ) = ±σX
ϕ,
(5.6)
where V = EH (m). The action of the gauge group H R of EH R preserves T ± and we define
the moduli space Mgauge (GR , σX , σG , c, ±) of (σX , σG , c, ±)-real solutions to (5.4) on EH R
as the set of triples (σEH , A, ϕ) ∈ T ± with (A, ϕ) satisfying (5.4) modulo the gauge group
H R.
Theorem 5.1 can now be reformulated as follows.
Theorem 5.3. Fix the topological class of EH to be d ∈ π1 (H), then (5.5) restricts to give
a homeomorphism
Md (GR , σX , σG , c, ±) ∼
= Mgauge (GR , σX , σG , c, ±) .
5.2. Real Higgs bundles and compatible representations of the orbifold fundamental group. Let x ∈ X and π1 (X, x) be the fundamental group of X. A representation of π1 (X, x) in GR is a homomorphism ρ : π1 (X, x) −→ GR . The group GR acts on
the set Hom(π1 (X, x), GR ) of all such homomorphisms by conjugation:
(g · ρ)(γ) = gρ(γ)g −1

for g ∈ GR , ρ ∈ Hom(π1 (X, x), GR ) and γ ∈ π1 (X, x). If we restrict the action to
the subspace Hom+ (π1 (X, x), GR ) consisting of reductive representations, the orbit space is
Hausdorff. By a reductive representation we mean one that composed with the adjoint
representation in the Lie algebra of GR decomposes as a sum of irreducible representations.
Define the moduli space of representations or character variety of π1 (X, x) in GR to
be the orbit space
R(G) = Hom+ (π1 (X, x), G)/G .
The moduli space R(GR ) is independent of the choice of base point x ∈ X and has the
structure of an algebraic variety [Ri].

Given a representation ρ ∈ Hom(π1 (X, x), GR ) there is an associated flat GR -bundle
on X, and conversely, the holonomy of a flat GR -bundle on X defines a representation
ρ ∈ Hom(π1 (X, x), GR ). More precisely, there is a bijection between the set of equivalence
classes of representations Hom(π1 (X, x), GR )/GR and the set of equivalence classes of flat
GR -bundles, which in turn is parameterized by the cohomology set H 1 (X, GR ).

REAL HIGGS PAIRS AND NON-ABELIAN HODGE CORRESPONDENCE

35

Given a representation ρ ∈ Hom(π1 (X, x), GR ) there is a topological invariant taking
values in π1 (GR ) = π1 (H R ). Fixing d ∈ π1 (GR ) we can consider the subvariety Rd (GR ) ⊂
R(GR ) consisting of those representations with topological class d.

The non-abelian Hodge correspondence states that there is a homeomorphism
(5.7)
Rd (GR ) ∼
= Md (GR ) .

The proof of (5.7) is given by combining (5.5) and Donaldson–Corlette’s existence theorem
of harmonic metrics. To explain this, let EGR be a C ∞ principal GR -bundle over X with
fixed topological class d ∈ π1 (GR ) = π1 (H R ). Fix a reduction EH R of the structure group h
of EGR to H R . We have that
EGR (gR ) = EH R (hR ) ⊕ EH R (mR ) .
The covariant derivative D on EGR (gR ) of a connection on EGR decomposes uniquely as
D = dA + ψ ,

(5.8)

where A is a connection on EH R and dA is its covariant derivative, and ψ ∈ Ω1 (X, EH R (mR )).
Let FA be the curvature of A. Consider the following set of equations for the pair (A, ψ):
FA + 21 [ψ, ψ] = 0
dA ψ = 0
d∗A ψ = 0 .

(5.9)

These equations are invariant under the action of H R , the gauge group of EH R . The theorem
of Corlette [Co] (see Donaldson [Do] for GR = SL(2, C)), says that there is a homeomorphism
{Reductive flat connections D on EGR }/G R ∼
= {(dA , ψ) satisfying (5.9)}/H R . (5.10)
Recall that a flat connection is said to be reductive if the holonomy representation is
reductive.

To complete the argument, leading to (5.7), we just need (5.5) and the simple fact that
the correspondence (A, ϕ) 7−→ (A, ψ := ϕ − τ (ϕ)) defines a homeomorphism
{(A, ϕ) satisfying (5.4)}/H R ∼
(5.11)
= {(A, ψ) satisfying (5.9)}/H R .
The first two equations in (5.9) are equivalent to the flatness of D = dA + ψ, and (5.10)
simply says that in the G R -orbit of a reductive flat connection D0 on EGR we can find a
flat connection D = g(D0 ) with g ∈ G R such that if we write D = dA + ψ, the additional
condition d∗A ψ = 0 is satisfied, where the operator d∗A is defined using the Hodge ∗-operator
given by the complex structure of X. This can be interpreted more geometrically in terms
of the reduction g(h) of EGR to an H R -bundle obtained by the action of g on the initial
reduction h. The equation d∗A ψ = 0 is equivalent to the harmonicity of the section of the
GR /H R -bundle EGR (GR /H R ) defined by g(h).
If, as in Section 5.1, we are equipped with conjugations σX and σG , c ∈ ZισG , and EH
is a C ∞ H-bundle, we can consider a (σX , σG , c)-real structure σEH on EH . If we fix also a
reduction h of structure group EH R chosen to be σEH -compatible, then σEH will restrict to
σEH R on EH R , and since σG preserves mR , we also have a restriction σEH R (mR ) : EH R (mR ) −→
EH R (mR ). Let EGR the GR -bundle obtained from EH R by extension of structure group. Since
σG preserves GR , we can extend σEH R to a map σEGR : EGR −→ EGR , and we also have
σEGR (gR ) : EGR (gR ) −→ EGR (gR ).

36

I. BISWAS, L. A. CALVO, AND O. GARCÍA-PRADA

Let D be a connection on EGR . Recall that this can be regarded as a map D : T EGR −→
gR . The compact conjugation τ : g −→ g preserves gR and hence we can consider the connection τ (D) := τ ◦ D. Let P ± be the set of pairs (σEGR , D), where σEGR is as above and D
1
1
is a connection on EGR such that the connection τ 2 ∓ 2 (D) is σEGR -compatible. Abusing notation, let D denote also the covariant derivative defined by D on EGR (gR ). From (5.8) we have
the decomposition D = dA + ψ, where A is a connection on EH R and ψ ∈ Ω1 (X, EH R (mR )).
Since τ (A) = A and τ (ψ) = −ψ, the set of pairs P ± can be identified with the set
∗
of triples (σEGR , A, ψ), where A is σEH R -compatible and σEGR (mR ) (ψ) = ±σX
(ψ). Setting ψ := ϕ − τ (ϕ), it is immediate that P ± is then in bijection with the set of triples
(σEH , A, ϕ) ∈ T ± considered in Section 5.1. The uniqueness of the harmonic section provided by the Donaldson–Corlette theorem (5.10) (recall that GR is semisimple) implies that
this section is fixed by σEGR , or more precisely, by the corresponding map defined on the
space of sections of EGR (GR /H R ). As a consequence of this and (5.11) we have the following.
Proposition 5.4. The bijection (5.10) restricts to give a bijection
{(σEGR , D) ∈ P ± with D reductive flat}/G R ∼
= Mgauge (GR , σX , σG , c, ±).
We now need to identify {(σEGR , D) ∈ P ± with D reductive flat}/G R in terms of representations of the fundamental group of X. To do this, fix a point x ∈ X, such that
σX (x) 6= x. The orbifold fundamental group Γ(X, x) of (X, σX ) is, as a set, the disjoint union of π1 (X, x) and
Path(X, x) := {Homotopy classes of paths γ : [0, 1] −→ X | γ(0) = x, γ(1) = σX (x)},

Let R(GR , σX , σG , c, ±) be the variety consisting of GR -conjugacy classes of (σX , σG , c, ±)bR whose restriction to π1 (X, x) is reductive,

±
that is, its conjugacy class is an element in R(GR ). We have the following.
Proposition 5.5. The holonomy representation defines a bijection
{(σE , D) ∈ P ± with D reductive flat }/G R ∼
= Rd (GR , σX , σG , c, ±).
GR

Proof. Recall that the holonomy representation ρ : π1 (X, x) −→ GR induced by a flat
connection D on EGR is defined as follows: let γ ∈ π1 (X, x), there is a lift e
γ : [0, 1] −→ EGR
∂
of γ such that D(e
γ∗ ∂t ) = 0. Let e = e
γ (0). If e
γ (1) = eg, then ρ(γ) := g.

Let (σERG , D) ∈ P ± where D is reductive flat connection. We define a homomorphism ρb =
bR in the following way: ρb|π (X,x) := ρ. Let γ ∈ Γ(X, x) \ π1 (X, x),

and let e be an element in the fiber EGR at x. Let e′ ∈ EGR be the point obtained by parallel
transport by D of e along γ. Let gγ ∈ GR be the element of the group such that
e = f (e′ )σG (gγ ) ,

where f : EGR −→

is the isomorphism of principal G -bundles induced by

ρb(γ) := gγ ,
for every γ ∈ Γ(X, x) \ π1 (X, x). Following the same arguments as in the proof of [BGH1,
Proposition 4.4], one shows that ρb is a (σX , σG , c, ±)-compatible representation. Equivalence
classes of (σERG , D) ∈ P ± where D is reductive flat connection correspond to equivalence
classes of (σX , σG , c, ±)-compatible representations since hol(D) satisfies that hol(D)(eg) =
ghol(D)(e)g −1 for all g ∈ GR and for all e in the fiber of EGR at the point x.
bR± be a (σX , σG , c, ±)-compatible representation. The
Conversely, let ρb : Γ(X, x) −→ G
induced representation ρ : π1 (X, x) −→ GR corresponds to a flat GR -bundle (EGR , D). A
∗
map f : EGR −→ σX
σG (EGR ) can be constructed using (5.14) and it can be extended to
the other fibers as is done in [BGH1, p. 18]. From [BGH1, Proposition 4.3], the morphism
1 1
f defines a pair (σEGR , D) ∈ P ± . The σEGR -compatibility of τ 2 ∓ 2 (D) follows from the
(σX , σG , c, ±)-compatibility of ρb.


Combining Propositions 5.5 and 5.4 and Theorem 5.3 we have now the following nonabelian Hodge correspondence for real GR -Higgs bundles.
Theorem 5.6. There is a homeomorphism
Rd (GR , σX , σG , c, ±) ∼
= Md (GR , σX , σG , c, ±) .

Remark 5.7. Theorem 5.6 generalizes the result in [BGH3] for a complex reductive Lie group
G, since G can be viewed as a real form of G × G, as mentioned in the introduction.

6. Involutions of moduli spaces
Consider the same setup and notation of Section 5.
6.1. Involutions of Higgs bundle moduli spaces. Let M(GR ) be the moduli space of
polystable GR -Higgs bundles over X. The (σX , σG , c, ±)-real GR -Higgs bundles studied in
Section 5 appear in a natural way as fixed points of certain involutions on the moduli space
M(GR ), in a similar way as they do in the case when GR is complex, as studied in [BG],
whose approach we follow closely. Recall that σX is a conjugation of X, σG is a conjugation
of G satisfying the conditions given at the beginning of Section 5, and c ∈ ZισG , where ZισG
is defined by (5.1).
Let (E, ϕ) be a GR -Higgs bundle on X. Let σG (E) be the C ∞ principal H-bundle on
X obtained by extending the structure group of E using the conjugation σG : H −→ H.
∗
Since σX is antiholomorphic, the pullback σX
σG (E) is a holomorphic H-bundle over X.
Let
σf
G : E(m) −→ E(m)
be the conjugate linear isomorphism that sends the equivalence class of any (e , v) ∈ E × m
to the equivalence class of (e , σG (v)). Let σG (ϕ) be the C ∞ section of E(m) ⊗ KX defined
by σf
G and the antiholomorphic involution σKX : KX −→ KX induced by σX . We have the
following involutions.

As a consequence of Corollary 5.2, there is a forgetful map

We denote by M(G

Proposition 6.1. The fixed points of ιM (σX , σG )± and the moduli spaces of polystable

σG (E) induced by σE , and this defines a

Aut(E, ϕ) of automorphisms of (E, ϕ). Since (E, ϕ) is assumed to be simple, this group
∗
coincides with Z(H) ∩ Ker(ι). Let c := σX
σG (f ) ◦ f ∈ Z(H) ∩ Ker(ι). Since f commutes
∗
with σX σG (f ) ◦ f , we have that σG (c) = c. Therefore, c ∈ Z2σG ∩ ker(ι), and f defines a
(σX , σG , c)-real structure σE on E. For the real structure σE(m) ⊗ σKX induced by σE and

σX we have that σE(m) ⊗ σX (ϕ) = ±ϕ, since by hypothesis ϕ ∼
= ±fe(ϕ).

6.2. Involutions of character varieties. We study now the involutions of the character
variety R(GR ) corresponding to the involutions (6.1) of M(GR ) via the non-abelian Hodge
correspondence (5.7). This generalizes the case in which GR is complex treated in [BG],
which again we follow closely.
Fix a point x ∈ X. The involution σX of X produces an involutive isomorphism
(σX )∗ : π1 (X, x) −→ π1 (X, σX (x)) .

This in turn gives an involution

(σX )∗ : Hom+ (π1 (X, x), GR )/GR −→ Hom+ (π1 (X, σX (x)), GR )/GR ,

(6.2)

which, abusing notation, we are also denoting by (σX )∗ . As mentioned above, R(GR ) =
Hom+ (π1 (X, x), GR )/GR is independent of the choice of the base point.
Let σ be an involution of GR . This defines an involution (denoted also by σ)
σ : R(GR ) −→ R(GR )

given by ρ 7−→ σ ◦ ρ. In other words, σ sends a homomorphism ρ : π1 (X, x) −→ GR to
the composition
ρ
σG
π1 (X, x) −→ GR −→
GR .
Clearly this involution commutes with the involution (σX )∗ in (6.2). Therefore, σ ◦ (σX )∗ is
also an involution.
One has the following.
Proposition 6.2. Let ιR (σX , σG )± be the map given by

ιR (σX , σG )± : R(GR ) −→
R(GR )
1
.
1
ρ
7−→ σG ◦ τ 2 ∓ 2 ◦ ρ ◦ (σX )∗

Then ιR (σX , σG )± is an involution of R(GR ) and the following diagram commutes:
M(GR )

∼

//

R(GR )

ιM (σX ,σG )±

R(GR ).

Proof. The fact that ιR (σX , σG )± is an involution follows from the previous discussion. The
commutativity of the diagram follows immediately from the construction of the non-abelian
Hodge correspondence map M(GR ) → R(GR ). Recall from Section 5.1 that if (E, ϕ) is a
polystable GR Higgs bundle, one associates to it the flat GR -connection D = dA + ϕ − τ (ϕ),
where the pair (A, ϕ) solves the Hitchin equations (5.4). The result follows now from the
properties of the holonomy map associating to D a representation of π1 (X, x) in GR .

Remark 6.4. Recall that a representation in R(GR ) is said to be irreducible if the centralizer
of the image of ρ in GR coincides with the center of GR . Under the non-abelian Hodge
correspondence (5.7) the subvariety of irreducible representations is in bijection with the
subvariety of stable and simple Higgs bundles (see [GGM1]).
