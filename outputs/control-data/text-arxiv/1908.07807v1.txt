ABSTRACT
High cadence ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared photometric and low-resolution spectroscopic
observations of the peculiar Type II supernova (SN) 2018hna are presented. The early phase multiband
light curves exhibit the adiabatic cooling envelope emission following the shock breakout up to ∼ 14 days
from the explosion. SN 2018hna has a rise time of ∼ 88 days in the V -band, similar to SN 1987A. A 56 Ni
mass of ∼ 0.087 ± 0.004 M is inferred for SN 2018hna from its bolometric light curve. Hydrodynamical
modelling of the cooling phase suggests a progenitor with a radius ∼ 50 R , a mass of ∼ 14–20 M
and an explosion energy of ∼ 1.7–2.9× 1051 erg. The smaller inferred radius of the progenitor than
a standard red supergiant is indicative of a blue supergiant progenitor of SN 2018hna. A sub-solar
metallicity (∼ 0.3 Z ) is inferred for the host galaxy UGC 07534, concurrent with the low-metallicity
environments of 1987A-like events.

1. INTRODUCTION

velope at the time of explosion. Theoretical (Grassberg
et al. 1971) and observational (Smartt 2009) studies of
Type II SNe indicate a Red Super-Giant (RSG) progenitor. However, the nearest naked-eye supernova in the
last four centuries, SN 1987A showed that a Blue SuperGiant (BSG) can also be a progenitor of Type II SNe.
The presence of a slow rise to the maximum (∼ 85 – 100
d) is the distinguishing feature in the light curves of
Type II SNe resulting from a BSG (Kleiser et al. 2011).
However, extended RSGs can also result in a slow rising

Type II SN if they synthesize a substantial amount of
56
Ni (∼ 0.2 M ) in the explosion (e.g. SN 2004ek, Taddia et al. 2016). Theoretical models have shown that
fast-rotation, low-metallicity and/or interaction in a binary system can indeed lead to the explosion of BSGs
as SNe (Podsiadlowski 1992).
In the vast expanse of data on Type II SNe, only a
handful of SNe have shown similarities to SN 1987A
(Hamuy & Suntzeff 1990; Pun et al. 1995). These
are SN 1998A (Pastorello et al. 2005), SN 2000cb
and SN 2005ci (Kleiser et al. 2011), SN 2006V and
SN 2006au (Taddia et al. 2012), SN 2009E (Pastorello
et al. 2012), SN 2009mw (Takáts et al. 2016) and
SN Refsdal (Rodney et al. 2016; Kelly et al. 2016).
These will be referred to as 1987A-like events, whereas,
Type II events with an RSG progenitor will be referred
to as normal Type II SNe. Analysis of 1987A-like events
have shown that these arise from rather compact progenitors (BSG, R < 100 R ) with a higher ZAMS mass,
higher explosion energies (> 1051 erg) and higher synthesized 56 Ni (∼ 0.1 M ) when compared to normal
Type II SNe (Pastorello et al. 2012; Taddia et al. 2016).
The collapse of the core in CCSNe is succeeded by a
shock wave resulting from the rebound of the in-falling
matter on the neutron-degenerate proto-neutron star
(collapsed core). A fraction of the energy lost during
this collapse is transferred via neutrino heating to the
outer ejecta. The shock accelerates towards the surface
of the star, releasing energy in X-ray and UV (Falk &
Arnett 1977) due to its high temperature (105 − 106 K,
Ensman & Burrows 1992). This short-lived (∼1000s in
RSGs) phase is labelled as the “shock” breakout and
marks the first electromagnetic signature of a SN explosion.
The cooling emission from the heated envelope as a
result of the shock breakout has been seen only in a
few Type II SNe such as SN 1987A (Ensman & Burrows
1992), SNLS-04D2dc (Tominaga et al. 2009), SN 2010aq
(Gezari et al. 2010) etc. The signature of a shock breakout is generally more prominent in Type IIb SNe with
extended envelopes, e.g. SN 1993J (Richmond et al.
1994) and SN 2011fu (Kumar et al. 2013). The thermal
emission from the heated ejecta peaks in the UV spanning a few hours to a couple of days (Nakar & Sari 2010).
The shock breakout may be delayed due to the presence
of a circumstellar wind as the shock not only has to escape the outer envelope of the SN ejecta, but also the
dense wind surrounding it (Ofek et al. 2013). During the
breakout, the energy released scales with the progenitor
radius and hence the detection of an early emission helps
in directly tracing the progenitor properties.
SN 2018hna was discovered by Koichi Itagaki on
2018 October 23.9 UT (JD 2458414.3) in the galaxy
UGC 07534. SN 2018hna lies 3100 E and 3000 N from the
nucleus of the host galaxy. A spectrum obtained by Hiroshima One-shot Wide-field POLarimeter (HOWPol,
Kawabata et al. 2008) on 2018 October 24.8 UT, dis-

played a prominent P-Cygni profile of H α categorizing
it as a Type II SN (TNS # 2933).
The photometric and spectroscopic evolution of
SN 2018hna is presented in this Letter, and discussed
in the context of 1987A-like events.
2. DATA ACQUISITION

Optical photometric (U BV RI) and spectroscopic observations of SN 2018hna using the 2-m Himalayan
Chandra Telescope (HCT), Indian Astronomical Observatory (IAO), Hanle, India began on 2018 October
31.9 UT (JD 2458423.4). The recently installed robotic
0.7-m GROWTH1 - India telescope (GIT) at IAO followed up SN 2018hna in the SDSS g 0 r0 i0 filters starting
2018 November 15.9 UT. SN 2018hna was also monitored with the 1.5-m Kanata Telescope in the optical
and the near-infrared using the HOWPol and the Hiroshima Optical and Near-InfraRed camera (HONIR;
Akitaya et al. 2014). Few spectra were also obtained using the Kyoto Okayama Optical Low-dispersion Spectrograph with Optical-Fiber Integral Field Unit (KOOLSIFU, Matsubayashi et al. 2019) mounted on the 3.8-m
Seimei telescope, at the Okayama Observatory. Data
reduction was performed using standard reduction procedures described in Singh et al. (2018). The follow-up
of SN 2018hna is supplemented by data from the public
archives of Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF; Bellm et al.
2019) in g and r bands, from Lasair (Smith et al. 2019),
and Gaia (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018) in g-band.
The Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Gehrels et al.
2004) monitored SN 2018hna with the ultraviolet Optical Telescope (UVOT; Roming et al. 2005) beginning
2018 October 23.6 UT. Data reduction was performed
using the UVOT data analysis software in HEASOFT
(see Kumar et al. 2018).
3. PHOTOMETRIC EVOLUTION

The ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared light curves
(LCs) of SN 2018hna are shown in Figure 1. The slow
rise to the maximum and the broad peak resemble the
peculiar Type II SN 1987A. Due to the immediate follow up with Swift, the early LCs in the optical and the
ultraviolet bands show a noticeable decline in brightness
during the initial phase, followed by a rise to maximum.
This drop can be explained as a result of the rapid cooling of the photosphere proceeding the shock breakout,
and was also seen in SN 1987A. Hydrodynamic modelling of the early LC constrained the explosion date
to be JD 2458411.3, 3 days prior to discovery (see Section 5.1). The peak in the V -band LC of SN 2018hna
at ∼ 87.5 d is adopted as the epoch of maximum. This
is similar to SN 1987A (∼ 86 days). A Galactic reddening of E(B − V ) = 0.009±0.001 mag along the direction

of SN 2018hna was obtained from the dust-extinction
map of Schlafly & Finkbeiner (2011). This is consistent
with the absence of interstellar Na I D absorption in
the spectra of SN 2018hna. No trace of Na I D absorption is seen at the redshift of the host galaxy, concurrent
with the high offset of SN 2018hna from the center of
the host. A net reddening of E(B − V ) = 0.009±0.001
mag is adopted assuming no host extinction. A distance
modulus of µ = 30.52 ± 0.29 mag (12.82 ± 2.02 Mpc) is
estimated for the host galaxy UGC 07534 from the mean
of the Hubble flow distances provided in NASA Extragalactic Database (NED2 ) and the Tully-Fisher relation
(Karachentsev et al. 2013).
4. SPECTROSCOPIC EVOLUTION

The spectral evolution of SN 2018hna is shown in
Figure 2A. The first spectrum of SN 2018hna obtained
at ∼ 12 d, shows strong, broad P-Cygni profiles of the

Balmer lines, Fe II features, Ca II NIR triplet, and weak
Ba II 4554 Å. He I 5876 Å was identified in the early
(∼ 3 days from explosion) spectrum of SN 1987A. However, the feature around 5740 Å is identified as Na I D
instead of He I 5876 Å due to the low color temperature
(< 8000 K) inferred from the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED).
As the SN evolved towards the maximum, features
of Na I D, Fe II, Ca II, Ba II, Sc II, Ti II and Sr II
became more prominent. The line identification in the
spectrum of ∼ 73 d is shown in Figure 2E. The features
of Ba II (i.e. 4554 and 6142 Å), which are characteristic
of 1987A-like events (Mazzali & Chugai 1995) are also
evident in the spectra (> 15 d) of SN 2018hna. The
prominent features during the late nebular phase (∼ 256
d) are labelled in Figure 2D. Feature marked “A”(∼ 8360
Å) is unidentified and warrants further investigation.
The P-Cygni profile of H α in SN 2018hna shows a
blue-shift in its emission feature during the photospheric
phase, which settles onto a constant value of ∼ 600

km s−1 during the transition to the radioactive decay
phase (> 100 d). The blue-shift has been seen in a majority of Type II SNe (including 1987A-like SNe) and has
been explained as arising from the steep density profile
of the outer SN ejecta (Anderson et al. 2014).
The absorption troughs of H α, H β and Na I D features in the spectra of SN 2018hna show a “kink” (flux
excess) beginning ∼ 37 d (see Figure 3). This feature is
strongest in the spectrum of ∼ 102 d, and disappeared
by ∼ 112 d. The presence of Ba II in the troughs of Na I
D and H α can possibly explain this feature, although,
this line blend should be seen as absorption and not an
emission during the photospheric phase. This complex
fine-structure was also detected in SN 1987A (Hanuschik
et al. 1988; Phillips & Heathcote 1989) and comprised of
a blue-shifted flux excess and a red-shifted flux deficit,

of which only the former is seen in SN 2018hna. The
origin of these kinks is likely a result of asymmetry in
the line-emitting region. The velocities of these kinks
closely follow the photospheric velocity evolution as in
SN 1987A and indicate the advent of high-energy radiation from the decay of 56 Ni at the photosphere (Phillips
& Heathcote 1989).
5. DISCUSSION

SN 2018hna occurred in the outskirts (∼ 2.5 kpc
from the center) of the low-luminosity (MB ∼ –17.1
mag) dwarf irregular galaxy (IBm) UGC 07534. The
luminosity-metallicity relation of Tremonti et al. (2004)
yields an oxygen abundance of 8.14 ± 0.02 for UGC 07534.
This indicates a sub-solar metallicity (∼ 0.3 Z ) of the
host environment of SN 2018hna and is consistent with

Absolute Magnitude [mag]

The early LCs (< 14 d) of SN 2018hna distinctly show
adiabatic cooling of the shock-heated SN ejecta. The
early emission in the B and V bands shows a rise towards an initial peak. This is a result of the “temperature effect” resulting from the migration of the SN SED
into the optical wavelengths while the net bolometric
luminosity is still declining (Fremling et al. 2019).
Prominent signature of cooling emission is generally
seen in Type II (distinctly in IIb) SNe, arising from an
extended envelope surrounding their compact core. A
similar emission can be seen for a compact BSG progenitor, e.g. 1987A-like events. Since the cooling emission is generally stronger for a more extended and/or
more massive envelope, one could use this emission to
infer the properties of the H-rich envelope (Nakar & Sari
2010; Bersten et al. 2012; Nakar & Piro 2014).
The multi-color light curves of an explosion of a BSG
star were computed with the multigroup radiation hydrodynamics code STELLA (Blinnikov et al. 2000). The
resultant synthetic SED was convolved with the filter
transmission function of the respective bandpasses. The
multi-color light curves of SN 2018hna during the cooling phase were well reproduced for a star of pre-SN mass
∼ 16 M (i.e. an ejecta mass ∼ 14 M ), a radius of ∼ 50
R and an explosion energy of ∼ 1.7 × 1051 erg (see Fig-

The Ba II 6142 Å feature in SN 2018hna was identified
as early as ∼ 15 d, similar to SN 1987A, but much earlier
in comparison to normal Type II SNe (seen ∼ 50 d). The
strength of Ba II features in SN 1987A primarily arises
from the over-abundance of Barium in the entirety of its
hydrogen envelope due to the faster cooling of the SN
ejecta resulting from its compact progenitor (Mazzali &
Chugai 1995). Also, slow-expanding ejecta are denser
and produce stronger Ba II features in 1987A-like and
low-luminosity Type II SNe (e.g. SN 2005cs, Pastorello
et al. 2009). SN 2018hna does not show as strong a Ba II
feature as in SN 1987A due to its relatively bluer colors
along with a faster photospheric velocity (50% faster
at V -band maximum). This is evident in the spectral
comparison in Figures 2B, C & D.
The velocity evolution of H α and Fe II λ5169 feature of SN 2018hna indicates an evolution similar to
SN 1987A during the early phase, that subsequently
flattens out at a higher velocity (see Figure 3). This
is possibly a result of the higher explosion energy
in SN 2018hna, which leads to broader line profiles
throughout its evolution.
The cooling envelope phase in 1987A-like events shows
a steep rise in colors as seen in the evolution of U–V and
B–V colors (Figures 5B and C). Post the cooling phase,
the evolution is almost flat. SN 2018hna, SN 2006au

In the case of a compact progenitor, the drop in temperature post the shock breakout reduces once the temperature reaches in the bracket of 6000-8000 K due to
the process of recombination. Hence, the luminosity in
the redder bands (V RI) keeps rising as the temperature falls to this bracket, whereas the luminosity in the
UV-bands keeps falling as the wavelength evolves to the
Wein’s part of the spectrum (Nakar & Piro 2014). The
inset in Figure 5A shows the comparison of SN 2018hna
with SN 1987A during the cooling envelope phase. The
luminosity and time-scale of the cooling emission overlaps between the two SNe. This is indicative of similarity in progenitor properties (like radius and the ratio of ejecta energy to mass) between SN 2018hna and
SN 1987A. We rule out the delay of the shock breakout
due to an immediate CSM, as no observable feature of
such interaction is discernible in the spectral sequence
of SN 2018hna.
The long rise-time of 1987A-like events can be explained due to the slow diffusion of radiation from the
decay of radioactive 56 Ni through the massive envelope
of the progenitor. Hence, the time taken for the radiation to diffuse through the ejecta is used to estimate the
mass using the relation from Arnett (1979) for radioactively powered SNe. Using E87A = 1.1 × 1051 erg s−1
and M87A = 14 M (Blinnikov et al. 2000), diffusion
time, td ∼ 1.02 t1987A
and a similar mean opacity, an
d
ejecta mass of ∼ 19.8 M and an Eexpl of ∼ 2.9 × 1051 erg
is inferred for SN 2018hna.

and SN 2006V are bluer compared to SN 1987A. This
agrees with the fact that 1987A-like events with bluer
colors tend to be brighter at maximum (Taddia et al.
2016). SN 2018hna is bluer in U–V by ∼ 1.6 mag and
in B–V by ∼ 0.4 mag. Differences in color can partially

1987A-like Type II SN 2018hna
be attributed to higher line-blanketing in SN 1987A (see
Figure 2C) and/or higher 56 Ni-mixing in comparison to
SN 2018hna and other events. Post maximum, the colors
turn redder, and are similar to SN 1987A during the
transition to the radioactive decay phase (beyond ∼ 125
d).
It is seen that the progenitors of 1987A-like events
produce higher amount of 56 Ni in comparison to normal Type II SNe as majority of them have higher ejecta
masses (Taddia et al. 2016). The degree of 56 Ni-mixing
and the net amount of 56 Ni synthesized helps change
the rise to the maximum. A larger 56 Ni mass increases
the time taken to rise to the bolometric peak (rise time)
and brightens the peak, whereas a higher degree of 56 Nimixing decreases the rise time.
The optical (U BV RI) bolometric luminosity of
SN 2018hna is higher than SN 1987A during the maximum and the radioactive decay phase (Figure 5A).
The bolometric luminosity including NIR contribution
(U BV RIJHKs) of SN 2018hna is 16 ± 5% brighter
than SN 1987A during the radioactive decay phase
(∼ 150 d). Hence, the 56 Ni synthesized in SN 2018hna is
0.087 ± 0.004 M . The rise to the bolometric maximum
is steeper in SN 2018hna in comparison to SN 1987A
and signifies a slightly lower-degree of 56 Ni-mixing in
its ejecta. The luminosity at maximum of 1987A-like
events is roughly ∼ 1.5 times the luminosity from the
radioactive decay (Dessart & Hillier 2019), however, in
the case of SN 2018hna it is more than twice (∼ 2.5).
Blue-shifted emission lines in the nebular phase have
shown to be an indicator of dust formation in the ejecta
of SNe (Elmhamdi et al. 2003) as the receding component of ejecta is blocked by the newly synthesized dust
(Sarangi et al. 2018). Blue-shifted emission of [O I],
Hα and [Ca II] is seen during the nebular phase of
SN 2018hna (see right panel in Figure 3). The peak of
these emission lines stays at almost a constant velocity
of ∼ 1200, 600 and 1100 km s−1 , respectively, throughout the nebular phase. These numbers are consistent
with the fact that Oxygen and Calcium are found deeper
in the ejecta than Hydrogen. The first overtone of CO
emission (∼ 2.3 µm) was detected in SN 2018hna in the
near-infrared spectrum of ∼ 153 d (Rho et al. 2019). A
similar feature was also detected in SN 1987A around
∼ 136 d. In all, the signatures above are an indication
of dust in the ejecta of SN 2018hna.
6. SUMMARY

A detailed analysis of the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of the SN 1987A-like supernova
SN 2018hna is presented in this Letter, based on which
the following are inferred:
• signature of shock breakout is seen in the early
phase. SN 2018hna is only the second BSG event
caught within a few days from shock breakout;

7

• the rise to maximum is slow, similar to other
1987A-like events, with a peak V -band absolute
magnitude of -16.35 ± 0.32 mag;
• an explosion energy of ∼ 1.7-2.9× 1051 erg, a BSG
progenitor with a radius ∼ 50 R , and mass ∼ 1420 M ; and
• a sub-solar metallicity (∼ 0.3 Z ) for the host
galaxy UGC 07534, in coherence with the lowmetallicity of other 1987A-like events.
