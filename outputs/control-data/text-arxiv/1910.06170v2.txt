Particle production in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions depends on the details of the nucleon
density distributions in the colliding nuclei. We demonstrate that the charged hadron multiplicity
distributions in isobaric collisions at ultrarelativistic energies provide a novel approach to determine
the poorly known neutron density distributions and thus the neutron skin thickness in finite nuclei,
which can in turn put stringent constraints on the nuclear symmetry energy.

Introduction. Nuclei are bound states of protons and
neutrons by the overall attractive nuclear force. The nuclear force is short ranged, and is surpassed by Coulomb
repulsion among protons at long distances. This is compensated by more neutrons to keep heavy nuclei bound.
With more neutrons comes the penalty symmetry energy
associated with the asymmetry between the proton and
neutron numbers. The symmetry energy influences the
proton and neutron density distributions, and in particular, the neutron skin thickness in nuclei (difference between the rms radii of the neutron and proton distributions, ∆rnp ≡ rn − rp ) [1]. The symmetry energy and
its density dependence are crucial to our understanding
of the masses and drip lines of neutron-rich nuclei and
the equation of state (EOS) of nuclear and neutron star
matter [2–10].
Measurements of the neutron density and the ∆rnp ,
complemented by state-of-the-art theoretical calculations [11–14], can yield valuable information on the symmetry energy [15–18]. Exact knowledge of nucleon density distributions is also crucial to new physics searches
beyond the standard model [19]. Because protons are
charged, its density distributions are well measured by
electrons scattering off nuclei [20, 21]. The density distributions are not as well measured [17]; for example,
the ∆rnp measurements of the benchmark 208 Pb nucleus
fall in the range of 0.15-0.22 fm with a typical precision of 20-50% [16, 17, 22]. One limitation is the inevitable uncertainties in modeling the strong interaction
of the reaction mechanisms [23]. Promising ways to measure neutron densities are through electroweak parityviolating scattering processes with electrons [24, 25] and
neutrinos [26], exploiting the large weak charge of the
neutron compared to the diminishing one of the proton.

Such measurements, although cleaner to interpret, require large luminosities [16, 27]. The current measurement by PREX (The Lead Radius Experiment) on the
208

The symmetry energy affects observables in low to intermediate energy heavy ion collisions, such as the isospin
diffusion [29, 30], the neutron-proton flow difference [31],
the isospin dependent pion production [32], and light
cluster formation [33]. Heavy ion collisions at relativistic energies are generally considered insensitive to nuclear structures and the symmetry energy. Recent stud96

GeV indicate, however, that nuclear density distributions
have a noticeable effect on the total charged hadron multiplicity (Nch ) [34, 35]. Since Nch can be measured precisely, we demonstrate in this work that the Nch distributions in isobaric collisions can be used to determine
the ∆rnp (and hence the symmetry energy) to a precision that may be comparable to or even exceed those
achieved by traditional low energy nuclear experiments.
The symmetry energy and the neutron skin. The symmetry energy encodes the energy related to neutronproton asymmetry in nuclear matter EOS. It is conventionally defined in the binding energy per nucleon,
E(ρ, δ) = E0 (ρ) + Esym (ρ)δ 2 + O(δ 4 ), where ρ = ρn + ρp
is the nucleon number density and δ = (ρn − ρp )/ρ is
the isospin asymmetry with ρp (ρn ) denoting the proton
(neutron) density [4]. The symmetry energy can be obtained as Esym (ρ) =

Esym (ρc ) = 26.65 ± 0.20 MeV [36] is precisely obtained
from nuclear binding energies [36]. At this ρc , a strong
constraint L(ρc ) = 47.3 ± 7.8 MeV is obtained from the
electric dipole polarizibility data of 208 Pb [37]. Generally,
it is found that the L(ρc ) displays a particularly strong
positive correlation with the ∆rnp of heavy nuclei.
In the present work, we use two different nuclear energy density functionals to describe nuclear matter EOS
and the properties of finite nuclei, namely, the standard
Skyrme-Hartree-Fock (SHF) model (see, e.g., Ref. [38])
and the extended SHF (eSHF) model [39, 40]. These two
models have been very successful in describing the structures of finite nuclei, especially global properties such as
binding energies and charge radii. Compared to SHF,
the eSHF contains additional momentum and densitydependent two-body forces to effectively simulate the momentum dependence of the three-body forces [40]. Fitting to data using the strategy in Ref. [41], we obtain
an interaction parameter set (denoted as Lc47) within
eSHF by fixing L(ρc ) = 47.3 MeV [37] with Esym (ρc ) =
26.65 MeV [36]. We also construct two more parameter
sets (Lc20 and Lc70) with L(ρc ) = 20 MeV and 70 MeV,
respectively, keeping the same Esym (ρc ) [36], to explore
the effects of the symmetry energy (and neutron skin)
variations. For the SHF calculations, we use the wellknown interaction set SLy4 [42, 43].
Table I lists the nuclear radii of 96 Zr and 96 Ru, assuming spherical symmetry, from the eSHF calculations using
Lc20, Lc47 and Lc70, and the SHF calculation with SLy4,
together with the L(ρc ) and L parameters. It is seen that
the four interactions give similar proton rms radius rp for
96
Zr and 96 Ru since they are experimentally well constrained, but the neutron radius rn increases with L(ρc )
and L, leading to a positive correlation between ∆rnp
and L(ρc ) (and L) as expected. The ∆rnp of 208 Pb from
our calculations are also listed in Tab. I. We note that
those values essentially cover the current uncertainty in
the 208 Pb measurements. Shown in Fig. 1 are the corresponding nucleon density distributions of 96 Ru and 96 Zr.
In the following, we use these density distributions in
heavy ion collision models to examine the effects on Nch .

Heavy ion collision models. We use four typical, well
developed, commonly used models for relativistic heavy
ion collisions. The Hijing (Heavy ion jet interaction generator, v1.411) [44, 45] is an event generator of heavy ion
collisions using binary nucleon-nucleon (NN) collisions
based on the Glauber theory, incorporating nuclear shadowing effect and partonic energy loss in medium. Each
NN collision is described by multiple mini-jet production inspired by perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), with the LUND [46] string fragmentation.
The AMPT (A Multi-Phase Transport) is a dynamical
model [47]. Its default version (AMPT-def, v1.26) uses
Hijing but subjects the mini-jet partons to partonic scatterings via ZPC (Zhang’s parton cascade) [48] and, after fragmentation, hadronic scatterings via ART (a relativistic transport) [49]. The string melting version of
AMPT (AMPT-sm, v2.26) [50] converts all hadrons from
Hijing to partons to undergo partonic scatterings, and
uses a simple coalescence for hadronization, followed by
hadronic rescatterings. The UrQMD (Ultra relativistic
Quantum Molecular Dynamics, v3.4) [51, 52] is a microscopic transport model with covariant propagation of
hadrons on classical trajectories, combined with stochastic binary scatterings, color string formation and resonance decays. Except for the input neutron and proton
density distributions, all parameters are set to default.
About 3 × 107 events within the impact parameter (b)
range [0, 20] fm are simulated in each model for each set
of the nuclear densities for Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collisions

at sNN = 200 GeV.
Model results and discussions. Charged hadrons are
counted with transverse momentum pT > 0.2 GeV/c and
pseudo-rapidity |η| < 0.5. Figure 2(a) shows the Nch distributions in Zr+Zr collisions calculated by the four models using the nuclear density set Lc47. The distributions
are similar except at large Nch . The absolute Nch values
are subject to large model dependence because particle
production in heavy ion collisions is generally hard to

model precisely. The shape of the Nch distribution is,
on the other hand, more robust. It is primarily determined by the interaction cross-section as a function of b.
While the tail fall-off shapes are similar among AMPTsm, AMPT-def, and UrQMD, that of Hijing is distinct.
To quantify the shape, we fit the tail distributions by
dP/dNch ∝ −Erf(−(Nch /N1/2 − 1)/w) + 1,

(1)

where N1/2 is the Nch value at half height and w is the
width of the tail relative to N1/2 . The fitted curves are
superimposed in Fig. 2(a). Figure 2(b) depicts the fit w
values. The Hijing model has a factor of ∼ 2 narrower tail
than the other three transport models which are similar.
This feature can be readily used to distinguish models
once data are available, though not the main goal of this
work.
The main goal of this work is to identify which density set would best describe data and hence to determine the neutron skin thickness and the symmetry energy. In a given model, at a given b, the numbers of participants (Npart ) and binary nucleon-nucleon collisions
(Nbin ) slightly differ for different nuclear densities. Since
Nch is generally considered to depend on Npart and perhaps Nbin , those differences could produce an effect on
Nch . The effect is understandably small, hardly observable in a plot of the Nch distributions themselves, but
can be magnified by the ratio of the Nch distribution in
Ru+Ru to that in Zr+Zr [35]. These ratios using the
four sets of densities, in AMPT-sm as an example, are
shown in Fig. 3. The splittings of the Nch tails are clear.
The ratios in Fig. 3 are illustrative to highlight the
differences but are cumbersome to quantify. As seen from
Fig. 2(b), the tail widths are equal among the densities
in a given model, so the splittings are mostly due to the
slight shifts in N1/2 , or differences in the average Nch
values. The N1/2 value is sensitive to the chosen fit range.
We thus use the relative hNch i difference between Ru+Ru

to quantify the splitting of the Nch tails. Experimental
measurements of Nch are affected by tracking inefficiency,
usually multiplicity dependent [53]. While this effect is
mostly canceled in R, it is better to use only central collisions, say top 5%, where the tracking efficiency is constant to a good degree. To experimentally determine the
centrality percentage, the peripheral collisions that are
not recorded because of online trigger inefficiency should
be taken into account. This trigger inefficiency can be experimentally corrected, and is equal between the isobar
systems as a function of Nch . Even without correction,
taking a conservative trigger efficiency of 95% [53], the
less than 2% difference in very peripheral collisions [35]
would yield only 10−3 mismatch in the centralities between the two systems. This would give a negligible uncertainty on R on the order of 2 × 10−4 . In short, since
R is a relative measure between Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collisions, much of the experimental effects cancel.
The R in each model must depend on how much the
Ru and Zr nuclear density distributions differ, which can
be characterized by ∆rnp of the Zr (or Ru) nucleus. We
therefore plot in Fig. 4 the R in the top 5% centrality
against ∆rnp of the Zr nucleus from the eSHF (SHF) calculations with Lc20, Lc47 and Lc70 (SLy4). It is found
that R monotonically increases with ∆rnp . This is because, with increasing ∆rnp , the difference between Ru
and Zr densities increases. This results in an increasing
difference in Nch between Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collisions.
Figure 4 further shows that the value of R has a relatively weak model dependence. This includes even Hijing
whose tail distribution is significantly narrower than the
other models (cf. Fig. 2), which can already be discriminated by data measurements as aforementioned. In what
follows, we further decipher what R entails by using non-

dynamical but intuitive geometrical models, namely, the
Glauber and Trento models.
In a Glauber model [54, 55], it is postulated that
Nch ∝ [(1 − x)Npart /2 + xNbin ], where x is the so-called
hard-component fraction. The Npart and Nbin differ between the two isobar collisions, in a manner sensitive
to the nuclear density parameters. This yields a nonvanishing R dependence of ∆rnp , as shown by the dynamical model results. In addition, the different contribution weights from Npart and Nbin to Nch , characterized
by the x parameter, also affect the R. The four models
giving similar R as function of ∆rnp may be indicative
of their similar x values. This is not surprising because
all these models can approximately describe the centrality dependence of Nch observed by the PHOBOS experiment, which suggested an x value of 0.1 [56]. In order to
investigate the sensitivity of R to the x value, we show
in Fig. 4 results from the Glauber model [57–59] with
x = 0.1 and a significantly larger value of x = 0.2 (which
can be taken as an extreme). Indeed the x = 0.1 results
fall within the range of the four dynamical models. The
x = 0.2 results have a stronger sensitivity to ∆rnp , indicating that the Nbin is more sensitive to the nuclear
density distribution.
On the other hand, the two-component particle production model has drawbacks. The centrality depen√
dences of Nch at sNN = 200 GeV and 2.76 TeV
have essentially the same shape [60], whereas the hardscattering cross-section, hence the x value, should vary
with energy. The PHENIX experiment found that a simple wounded quark model can successfully describe the
centrality dependence of Nch in Au+Au collisions over
7.7–200 GeV [61] and in several small systems at 200
GeV [62]. Recent azimuthal anisotropy data by STAR
in ultracentral U+U collisions cannot be described by
the Glauber approach [63] and the Trento model was
proposed [64]. In the Trento model, particle production is only related to the reduced thickness, Nch ∝
1/p
TR (p; TA , TB ) ≡ [(TAp + TBp )/2]
[64, 65]. We use the
√
parameter p = 0 (i.e., Nch ∝ TA TB ), a gamma fluctuation parameter k = 1.4, and a Gaussian nucleon size of
0.6 fm, which were found to well describe the multiplicity data in heavy ion collisions [64, 65]. The R calculated
by the Trento model is shown in Fig. 4. The ∆rnp dependence is weaker because only Npart contributes to the
Nch . Considering all model results, the overall spread in
R is wider at larger ∆rnp . This is because the nuclear
density difference between the Ru and Zr nuclei increases
with increasing ∆rnp , so does the model dependence.
Experimentally, the Nch can be measured exquisitely
precisely. The relative hNch i difference in central collisions is immune to many experimental uncertainties.
Figure 4 thus strongly suggests that the isobar data may
determine ∆rnp relatively accurately. This is afforded by
the rather weak dependence of the R observable to the
details of QCD physics on particle production. This is

in contrast to the hadronic observables in previous lowenergy studies, where strong model dependences prevent
a more precise determination [17, 22]. The current experimental range of the 208 Pb ∆rnp is indicated by the
band on the top of Fig. 4. The 208 Pb ∆rnp calculated
by the eSHF (SHF) to accommodate those low-energy
measurements are written above the band. Our results
in Fig. 4 indicate that with a given measurement of R,
the precision in the derived ∆rnp of 96 Zr can be as good
as 0.05 fm covered by the four dynamical models(AMPTsm, UrQMD, Hijing, AMPT-def) and the two static models (Trento and Glauber), as illustrated by the lower band
(taking hypothetically R = 0.006). This would be an appreciable improvement over the current constraint from
208
Pb. Our results shall thus provide a significant input to help constrain the symmetry energy, bearing important implications to nuclear matter and neutron star
EOS.
We have assumed spherical nuclei in our calculations.
The main idea of our work is still valid with deformed nuclei. There are a number of promising ways to determine
the nuclear deformity from heavy ion collisions [66–69].
We postpone such a study to a future work.
We focused on central collisions only, in part because of
the technical advantages aforementioned. However, one
would naively expect the neutron skin effect to be the
strongest in peripheral collisions. This would be true
if one could uniquely determine and sort events in b.
Experimentally, the collision centrality is usually determined by final-state particle multiplicity. In peripheral
low multiplicity events, a wide range of b is mixed due to
large fluctuations so that the nuclear density difference

5
is mostly smeared out.
We note that the final state Nch is sensitive only to
the overall nucleon density at relativistic energies, and
therefore indirectly sensitive to the neutron density (and
neutron skin) given that the proton density is well determined. In low energy nuclear reactions, isospin-sensitive
observables [70–73] were extensively studied where the
isospin-dependent interactions are important. Note that
we have studied isobaric collisions at fairly high energy
√
of sNN = 200 GeV primarily because those data have
already been taken so that our method can be readily
applied.
Conclusions. We have calculated nuclear densities by
energy density functional theory using several symmetry energy parameters. We show, using four dynamical
heavy ion collision models and two static models, that
the charged hadron multiplicity difference between iso96
96
96
bar 96
44 Ru+44 Ru and 40 Zr+40 Zr collisions has a strong
sensitivity to the neutron skin and the symmetry energy, with weak model dependence. Because the charged
hadron multiplicity can be precisely measured and because the systematic uncertainties largely cancel, our
findings suggest potentially significant improvement to
neutron skin and symmetry energy determination using
relativistic isobar collision data collected in 2018 at the
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider.
