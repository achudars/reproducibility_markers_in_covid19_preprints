QUASI-COMPLETE INTERSECTIONS IN P2 AND SYZYGIES.
PH. ELLIA
Abstract. Let C ⊂ P2 be a reduced, singular curve of degree d and equation f = 0.
Let Σ denote the jacobian subscheme of C. We have 0 → E → 3.O → IΣ (d − 1) → 0 (the
surjection is given by the partials of f ). We study the relationships between the Betti
numbers of the module H∗0 (E) and the integers, d, τ , where τ = deg(Σ). We observe
that our results apply to any quasi-complete intersection of type (s, s, s).

1. Introduction.
Let C ⊂ P2 be a reduced, singular curve, of degree d, of equation f = 0. The partials
∂f
of f determine a morphism: 3.O → O(d − 1), whose image is IΣ (d − 1), where according
to our assumptions, Σ ⊂ P2 , is a closed subscheme of codimension two. The subscheme Σ,
whose support is the singular locus of C, is called the jacobian subscheme of C. We denote
by τ its degree, it is the global Tjurina number of the plane curve C.
We have:
(1)

0 → E → 3.O → IΣ (d − 1) → 0

where E is a rank two vector bundle with Chern classes c1 = 1 − d, c2 = (d − 1)2 − τ (see
for instance [10] and references therein). The bundle E is the sheaf of logarithmic vector
fields along C, also denoted Der(− log C). ([13], [14], [4]). A particular case of this situation
is when C is an arrangement of lines ([7], [16]). This is a very active field of research with
a huge literature.
In ([8]), using techniques of the theory of singularities, du Plessis and Wall gave sharp
bounds on τ in function of d and d1 , the least twist of E having a section. Observe that
H∗0 (E) is the module of syzygies between the partials. This result has been extended (see
[10]) to the case of quasi-complete intersections (q.c.i.), using vector bundles techniques.
In this note, inspired by [5], instead of considering only d1 , the minimal degree of a
generator of H∗0 (E), we consider the full minimal resolution of this module. So we will
assume that H∗0 (E) is minimally generated by m elements of degree d1 ≤ d2 ≤ · · · ≤ dm .
The m-uple (d1 , · · · , dm ) is the exponent of C. We have m ≥ 2, with equality if and only if
E splits. In this case one say that C is a free divisor ([13], [1]) or, equivalently, that Σ is
an almost complete intersection. The case m = 3 is handled in [5]. Here we deal with the
general case m ≥ 3.

Starting from the minimal free resolution of H∗0 (E) we show how to get a free (non
necessarily minimal) resolution of IΣ . With this we show (Corollary 6) that if Σ is a
complete intersection, then m ≤ 4. Then (Theorem 8) we prove that 2d − 4 ≥ di , ∀i and
that the inequality is sharp if and only if Σ is a point (τ = 1). Finally we prove: dm = d − 1
or 2d − m ≥ dm .
Then Theorem 12), shows that d3 ≤ d − 1 and characterizes the q.c.i. realizing the lower
bound, (d − 1)(d − 1 − d1 ) = τ , in du Plessis-Wall theorem: this happens if and only if Σ is a
complete intersection (d − 1, d − 1 − d1 ). We also describe what happens in the next degree.
Finally, in the setting of q.c.i., we answer to a conjecture raised in [6] (Proposition 14)
and describe the sub-maximal case (see Proposition 16).
The exact sequence (1) presents Σ as a quasi-complete intersections (q.c.i.) of type
(d − 1, d − 1, d − 1). In our proofs we will never use the fact that the three curves giving
the q.c.i. are the partials of a polynomial f (!). So setting s = d − 1, all our results are true
for q.c.i. of type (s, s, s). Actually, after appropriate changes in notations (see [10]) they
should hold for all q.c.i. (i.e. of any type (a, b, c)). Observe that to determine the minimal
free resolution (m.f.r.) of H∗0 (E) amounts to determine the m.f.r. of the (non saturated
if m > 2) q.c.i. ideal J = (F1 , F2 , F3 ). For a purely algebraic approach to q.c.i. see for
example [15].
As the first version of this paper was finished I received the preprint [6] containing some
overlaps. This obliged me to revisit my text. This version contains some improvements (so
thank you to the authors of [6] !), but overlaps are still present. However, since the methods
are different, it could be useful to see how geometric techniques apply in this context.
I thank Alexandru Dimca for useful discussions, in particular about (i) of Theorem 12.

2. Setting, notations.
Following [5] we have:
Definition 1. We will say that C is a m-syzygy curve if H∗0 (E) is minimally generated
by m elements of degree d1 ≤ d2 ≤ · · · ≤ dm . The m-uple (d1 , · · · , dm ) is the exponent of
C.
Remark 2. We have m ≥ 2. Moreover m = 2 if and only if E is the direct sum of two
line bundles.
In the sequel we will always assume m ≥ 3.
For any i, E(di ) has a section vanishing in codimension two.
Besides the exact sequence (1) we will also consider the following ones:

The minimal presentation of H∗0 (E) yields

locally free of rank m − 2 with H∗ (K) = 0, hence K is a direct sum of line bundles.
0 → O → E(d1 ) → IZ (2d1 + 1 − d) → 0

Here Z ⊂ P2 is a locally complete intersection (l.c.i.), zero-dimensional subscheme of
degree
deg(Z) = c2 (E(d1 )) = d1 (1 − d) + (d − 1)2 − τ + d21

3. Resolutions.
Starting from (2) we can get the minimal free resolution of H∗1 (E) and H∗0 (IZ ), more
precisely:
Lemma 3. Let E be a rank two vector bundle on P2 and let Z = (s)0 , s ∈ H 0 (E(d1 )),
where d1 = min{k | h0 (E(k)) 6= 0}.
i) The following are equivalent:
a) H∗0 (E) is minimally generated by m elements
b) H∗1 (E) is minimally generated by m − 2 elements
c) H 0 (IZ ) is minimally generated by m − 1 elements.
Assume the minimal free resolution of H∗0 (E) is given by (2) and that c1 (E) = 1 − d,
then:
ii) The minimal free resolution of H∗1 (E) is

Proof. Let E be a rank two vector bundle on P2 and assume that H∗0 (E) is minimally
Lm
generated by m elements. We have G1 → E → 0, with G1 =
O(−di ). As explained
L 1
before the kernel, G2 , is a direct sum of line bundles: G2 =
O(−bj ). By dualizing the
exact sequence: 0 → G2 → G1 → E → 0, we get: 0 → E ∗ → G1∗ → G2∗ → 0. Taking into
account that E ∗ ≃ E(−c1 ) (c1 = c1 (E)) because E has rank two, we get: 0 → E → G1∗ (c1 ) →
G2∗ (c1 ) → 0. Taking cohomology this yields: 0 → H∗0 (E) → G∗1 (c1 ) → G∗2 (c1 ) → H∗1 (E) → 0.
This is the beginning of a minimal free resolution of H∗1 (E). We conclude with (2). This
proves (ii) and also a) ⇒ b) in (i). By uniqueness of the minimal free resolution this also
proves b) ⇒ a) in (i).

of H∗0 (E(d1 )).

4. Resolution of H∗0 (IΣ ).
Starting from the resolution of H∗0 (E) it is also possible to get a resolution of H∗0 (IΣ ) but
this resolution is not necessarily minimal:
Proposition 4. We have the following free resolution
(7)

0→

m
M

O(di − 2d + 2) →

m−2
M

O(bj − 2d + 2) ⊕ 3.O(1 − d) → IΣ → 0

j=1

i=1

This resolution is minimal up to cancellation of O(1 − d) terms with some O(di − 2d + 2)
(in this case di = d − 1).
Proof. Since IΣ (d − 1) is generated by global sections we can link Σ to a zero-dimensional
subscheme T by a complete intersection of type (d − 1, d − 1). From the exact sequence (1),
by mapping cone, we get that T is a section of E(d − 1). So we have an exact sequence:
Lm
0 → O(1 − d) → E → IT → 0. From (2) we get a surjection:
1 O(−di ) → IT → 0. Using
(2) we can build a commutative diagram and by the snake lemma we get:
0→

m−2
M

O(−bj ) ⊕ O(1 − d) →

m
M

O(−di ) → IT → 0

1

This resolution is minimal unless the section of E(d − 1) yielding T is a minimal generator
of H∗0 (E). From the above resolution, by mapping cone, we get the desired resolution of
IΣ . Again this resolution is minimal unless one curve (resp. both curves) of the complete
intersection (d − 1, d − 1) linking T to Σ is a minimal generator (resp. both curves are
minimal generators) of IT .
On the other hand, by minimality of the resolution (2) no term O(bj − 2d + 2) can
cancel.

Remark 5. Cancellations can occur. Let C = X ∪ L, where X is a smooth curve
of degree d − 1, d ≥ 3, and where L is a line intersecting X transversally. Clearly Σ is a
set of d − 1 points on the line L. The minimal free resolution of IΣ is: 0 → O(−d) →
O(−1) ⊕ O(1 − d) → IΣ → 0. Comparing with (4) we see that m = 3 and that two terms
O(1 − d) did cancel. So we have d1 = d − 2, d2 = d3 = d − 1.
See Remark 9 for another example.
Corollary 6. If m ≥ 5, Σ can’t be a complete intersection.
Proof. Indeed Σ is a complete intersection if and only if the minimal free resolution of IΣ
starts with two generators. According to Proposition 4 we have certainly m − 2 minimal
generators of degrees 2d − 2 − bj in the minimal free resolution of IΣ .

Before to go on we recall a basic fact about zero-dimensional subscheme of P2 :
Lemma 7. Let X ⊂ P2 be a zero-dimensional subscheme with minimal free resolution:
0→

. Then ai ≥ t, ∀i.
In particular if h0 (IX (n)) 6= 0, then H∗0 (IX ) can be generated by n + 1 elements.
Proof. This should be well known (see for example [9], Corollary 3.9), but for the convenience
of the reader we give a proof. We work by induction on t. The case t = 1 is clear. Assume
the statement for t − 1. Let a1 ≤ · · · ≤ at+1 . Since IX (at+1 ) is generated by global sections
we can always perform a liaison of type (a1 , at+1 ). By mapping-cone the linked scheme, T ,
has the following resolution:
0→

t
M

O(ai − a1 − at+1 ) →

t
M

O(bj − a1 − at+1 ) → IT → 0

This resolution is minimal and by the inductive assumption we get: a1 + at+1 − bj ≥ t − 1,
hence a1 ≥ bj − at+1 + t − 1. We have bj − at+1 ≥ 0, ∀j (they are the degrees of the elements
of the last row of the matrix M ). If bj − at+1 = 0, ∀j, then, by minimality, the last row of
M is zero, but this is impossible (the maximal minors of M are the generators). It follows
that a1 ≥ t.

Theorem 8. (i) With notations as above, if d ≥ 3, then 2d − 4 ≥ di , ∀i.
(ii) Moreover, if d > 3, we have equality (i.e. dm = 2d − 4) if and only if τ = 1.
(iii) We have dm = d − 1 (hence di ≤ d − 1, ∀i) or di ≤ 2d − m, ∀i.
Proof. (i) This is clear if di = d − 1, so we may assume that the term O(di − 2d + 2) really
appears in (7) even after possible cancellations. This implies 2d − 2 − di ≥ 2.

6

PH. ELLIA

(ii) We have min{2d − di − 2} = 2d − dm − 2. Assume 2d − dm − 2 = 2. For d > 3, the
term O(dm − 2d + 2) ≃ O(−2) really appears in the minimal free resolution of IΣ . This
implies that there are two generators of degree one, hence Σ is a point.
Conversely if Σ is a point, let T be linked to Σ by a complete intersection (d − 1, d − 1).
Then using the minimal free resolution of IΣ , by mapping-cone, we have: 0 → 2.O(−2d +
3) → 2.O(1 − d) ⊕ O(−2d + 4) → IT → 0. But using instead the resolution (1) we see that T
is a section of E(d−1), so we have 0 → O(1−d) → E → IT → 0. Using the above resolution
of IT , we get after some diagram-chasing: 0 → 2.O(−2d + 3) → 3.O(1 − d) ⊕ O(−2d + 4) →
E → 0. This resolution is clearly minimal. It follows that m = 4 and dm = 2d − 4.
(iii) Assume dm 6= d − 1, then, according to Proposition 4, the term O(dm − 2d + 2)
appears in the minimal free resolution of IΣ . Let 2d − 4 − u = dm . We have u ≥ 0 by
(i). Since there is a relation of degree u + 2, there are at least two minimal generators of
degree ≤ u + 1 in the minimal free resolution of IΣ . So h0 (IΣ (u + 1)) 6= 0 and IΣ can be
generated by u + 2 elements (Lemma 7). This implies (see 7) that m − 3 ≤ u + 1, hence
dm ≤ 2d − m.

Remark 9. (i) Point (i) was known by different methods (see [6], [3]).
(ii)The proof of (iii) above shows the following: if d 6= 4 and if dm = 2d − 5, then τ ≤ 4 or
h0 (IΣ (1)) = 0 but Σ contains a subscheme of length τ − 1 lying on a line.
(iii) If Σ = {p}, then for any d ≥ 3 we can present Σ as a q.c.i. of type (d − 1, d − 1, d − 1).
If d ≥ 3 it is clear that the term 3.O(1 − d) will cancel in (7).
We can have m = 4 and Σ a complete intersection, so the bound of Corollary 6 is sharp.
From the point of view of the jacobian ideal to get a curve C with τ = 1 we may argue as
follows. Let P denote the blowing-up of P2 at a point. We have P = F1 := P(OP1 ⊕ OP1 (1))
(see for ex. [2]). Denote by h, f the classes of OF1 (1) and of a fiber in P ic(F1 ). We have
h2 = 1 = hf, f 2 = 0. The exceptional divisor is E = h − f . For any a ≥ 1, the linear system
|ah + 2f | contains a smooth irreducible curve, C ′ , such that C ′ .E = 2. The image of C ′ in
P2 is a curve, C, of degree a + 2 with τ (C) = 1 (for a = 1 C is a nodal cubic).
Other examples with m = 4 and Σ complete intersection can be obtained by taking
C = A ∪ B where A, B are smooth curves, of degrees a, b, intersecting transversally. We
have d = a + b, τ = ab and Σ is a complete intersection (a, b). Assume a ≥ 2 then, arguing
as above, we get d1 = d − 2, d2 = d3 = d4 = d − 1, b1 = d + a − 2, b2 = d + b − 2 and the
corresponding resolution of H∗0 (E) is minimal.
Another consequence of Lemma 7:
Corollary 10. With notations as above (in particular m ≥ 3) we have:
(i) d1 + di ≥ d + m − 3, ∀i ≥ 2
(ii) Z is a complete intersection if and only if m = 3. In that case Z is a complete intersection
of type (d1 + d2 − d + 1, d1 + d3 − d + 1).

Q.C.I. IN P2 AND SYZYGIES

Proof. (i) This follows from (6) and Lemma 7.
(ii) Follows from (iii) of Lemma 3.

7



Remark 11. Part (i) is proved also in [6] and (ii) is Prop. 3.1. of [5]. The proofs are
different.
If m = 3 and d1 + d2 = d, following [5] one says that C is a plus one generated curve. We
see that C is a plus one generated curve if and only if Z (of degree d3 − d2 + 1) is contained
in a line. We recover the fact that C is nearly free (i.e. Z is a point) if, moreover, d3 = d2 .
5. Around the extremal cases in du Plessis-Wall’s theorem.
We recall the bound given by du Plessis-Wall ([8], see [10] for a different proof, valid also
for q.c.i.): (d − 1)(d − 1 − d1 ) ≤ τ ≤ (d − 1)(d − 1 − d1 ) + d21 .
Theorem 12. With notations as above:
(i) if m ≥ 3, we have d1 ≤ d2 ≤ d3 ≤ d − 1.
(ii) We have d + 1 ≥ m.
(iii) We have (d − 1)(d − 1 − d1 ) = τ if and only if Σ is a complete intersection of type
(d − 1, d − 1 − d1 ). In this case m = 3 and d2 = d3 = d − 1.
(iv) Assume τ = (d − 1)(d − 1 − d1 ) + 1. If τ > 1, then m = 4 and {di } = {d1 , d − 1, d −
1, d − 3 + d1 } or d1 = 1, m = 2 and E splits like O(−1) ⊕ O(d − 2).
Proof. (i) Let us denote by g1 , g2 , g3 the generators of degrees d1 , d2 , d3 of H∗0 (E). We will
coonsider the gi ’s as relations among the partials.
Consider the Koszul relations: Kz = (fy , −fx, 0), Ky = (fz , 0, −fx ), Kx = (0, fz , −fy ).
We have:
(9)

fz Kz − fy Ky + fx Kx = 0

The relations Kx , Ky , Kz correspond to sections sx , sy , sz of E(d − 1). It follows that d1 ≤
d − 1. We also clearly have d2 ≤ d − 1. Indeed otherwise Kx , Ky , Kz are multiple of g1 ,
which is impossible (P.(u1 , v1 , w1 ) = (fy , −fx , 0) implies w1 = 0 and going on this way we
get g1 = 0). If d3 ≥ d, these sections are combinations of g1 , g2 only. Now (9) yields a
relation involving only g1 and g2 . We claim that this relation is non trivial.
Indeed let sx = ag1 + bg2 , sy = a′ g1 + b′ g2 , sz = a′′ g1 + b′′ g2 . Then (9) becomes:
g1 (afx − a′ fy + a′′ fz ) + g2 (bfx − b′ fy + b′′ fz ) = 0. Assume afx − a′ fy + a′′ fz = 0 and
bfx − b′ fy + b′′ fz = 0. Then α = (a, −a′ , a′′ ) is a section of E(d − 1 − d1) and β = (b, −b′ , b′′ )
is a section of E(d − 1 − d2 ). Since d − 1 − d2 ≤ d1 − 1 (Corollary 10), we get β = 0, hence
b = b′ = b′′ = 0. Since d − 1 − d1 ≤ d2 − 1 (Corollary 10), we see that α is a multiple of
g1 : (a, −a′ , a′′ ) = P.(u1 , v1 , w1 ), where g1 = (u1 , v1 , w1 ). It follows that a = P u1 . Moreover
sx = (0, fz , −fy ) = ag1 = (P u21 , P u1 v1 , P u1 w1 ) and it follows that P u1 = 0 = a, hence
sx = 0, which is impossible.
So we have a non trivial relation Ag1 = Bg2 . We may assume (A, B) = 1 (otherwise just
divide by the common factors). It follows that B divides every components u1 , v1 , w1 of g1

and we get a relation (u′1 , v1′ , w1′ ) of degree < d1 , against the minimality of d1 . We conclude
that d3 ≤ d − 1.
(ii) From (i) we have 2d − 2 ≥ d1 + d3 . We conclude with Corollary 10.
(iii) Assume τ = (d − 1)(d − 1 − d1 ). Since IΣ (d − 1) is generated by global sections we
can link Σ to a subscheme Γ by a complete intersection F ∩ G of type (d − 1, d − 1). Clearly
deg(Γ) = (d − 1)2 − τ = d1 (d − 1). By mapping cone we have (after simplifications): 0 →
O → E(d−1) → IΓ (d−1) → 0. Twisting by 1−d+d1 we get: 0 → O(1−d+d1 ) → E(d1 ) →
IΓ (d1 ) → 0. Since τ > 0, d1 < d−1, hence h0 (IΓ (d1 )) 6= 0. It follows that Γ is contained in a
complete intersection (d1 , d−1). Indeed the base locus of the linear system of curves of degree
d − 1 containing Γ has dimension zero and d1 < d − 1. For degree reasons Γ is a complete
intersection (d1 , d − 1) and we have 0 → O(1 − d − d1) → O(−d1 ) ⊕ O(1 − d) → IΓ → 0. By
mapping cone again: 0 → O(1 − d) ⊕ O(d1 − 2d + 2) → O(d1 + 1 − d) ⊕ 2.O(1 − d) → IΣ → 0.
We claim that we can cancel the repeated term O(1 − d). Indeed, since dim(F ∩ G) = 0, we
may assume that F or G is not a multiple of, S, the curve of degree d1 containing Γ, hence
F or G is a minimal generator of H∗0 (IΓ ). It follows that Σ is a complete intersection. We
conclude with Proposition 4.
Conversely if Σ is a complete intersection (d − 1, d − 1 − d1 ), from Proposition 4 we get
m = 3 and d2 = d3 = d − 1.
(iv) We argue as above. The assumption τ > 1 makes sure that h0 (IΓ (d1 )) 6= 0. This
time we find that Γ is linked to one point by a complete intersection (d − 1, d1 ). By mapping
cone we get: 0 → 2.O(−d − d1 + 2) → O(−d − d1 + 3) ⊕ O(−d1 ) ⊕ O(−d + 1) → IΓ → 0.
This resolution is minimal except if d1 = 1 in which case we have: 0 → O(1 − d) →
O(2 − d) ⊕ O(−1) → IΓ → 0. As we have seen above Γ = (s)0 where s ∈ H 0 (E(d − 1)). If s
is a minimal generator of H∗0 (E), then H∗0 (IZ ) has m − 1 minimal generators, otherwise it
has m minimal generators. So if d1 > 1, 3 ≤ m ≤ 4. By mapping cone we go back to Σ. If
d1 > 1 we get: 0 → O(−d + d1 − 1) ⊕ O(−2d + 2 + d1) → 2.O(−d + d1 ) ⊕ O(1 − d) → IΣ → 0.
From Proposition 4 we conclude that m = 4 and {di } = {d1 , d − 1, d − 1, d − 3 + d1 }. If
d1 = 1, by mapping cone we get 0 → O(−2d + 3) ⊕ O(−d) → 3.O(1 − d) → IΣ → 0. This
resolution is minimal. Hence m = 2 and E splits like O(−d + 2) ⊕ O(−1).

Remark 13. See [5] for a different proof of part (i). Point (ii) is proved in [6].
Since the minimal free resolution of sets of points of low degree are known (see for example
[11] for a list), the analysis above can be extended to the cases τ = (d − 1)(d − 1 − d1 ) + x,
for small x.
It is easy to show that if τ reaches the upper-bound in the first part of du Plessis-Wall’s
theorem, then E splits (because c2 (E(d1 )) = 0 and h0 (E(d1 )) 6= 0) i.e. Σ is an almost
complete intersection (or C is a free curve). However there is a second part in du PlessisWall’s theorem: under the assumption 2d1 + 1 > d (which amounts to say that E is stable),
we have a better upper-bound: τ ≤ τ+ := (d− 1)(d− 1 − d1)+ d21 − 21 (2d1 + 1 − d)(2d1 + 2 − d).
Notice that this holds true also for q.c.i. ([10]).

In [6] Thm. 3.1, the authors prove that this bound is reached if and only if we have:
(10)

0 → (m − 2).O(−d1 − 1) → m.O(−d1 ) → E → 0

with m = 2d1 − d + 3.
This can be proved as follows. From the exact sequence (3) we have h0 (IZ (2d1 − d)) = 0
(observe that Z 6= ∅ because 2r + 1 > d). It follows that deg(Z) ≥ h0 (O(2d1 − d)).
The assumption τ = τ+ implies (use 4) that we have equality: deg(Z) = h0 (O(2d1 − d)).
This implies h1 (IZ (2d1 − d)) = 0. It follows (Castelnuovo-Mumford’s lemma or numerical
character) that the minimal free resolution of IZ is: 0 → s.O(−s − 1) → (s + 1).O(−s) →
IZ → 0, with s = 2d1 − d + 1. We conclude with Lemma 3.
Conversely if we have (10), by Lemma 3 we get that IZ has a linear resolution and
deg(Z) = h0 (O(2d1 − d)). This implies τ = τ+ .
Then the authors ask ([6] Conjecture 1.2)) if for any integer d ≥ 3 and for any integer r,
d/2 ≤ r ≤ d − 1, there exists Σ with d1 = r and τ = τ+ . I don’t know the answer in general
but, in the framework of q.c.i., the answer is yes:
Proposition 14. With notations as above, for every d ≥ 3 and for every integer r,
d/2 ≤ r ≤ d − 1, there exists a q.c.i. subscheme Σ ⊂ P2 , of degree τ+ , with d1 = r
Proof. Let us consider a zero-dimensional subscheme with a linear resolution:
(11)

0 → s.O(−s − 1) → (s + 1).O(−s) → IZ → 0

Since the Cayley-Bachararch condition CB(s − 3) is obviouslu satisfied we may associate
a rank two vector bundle to IZ (s): 0 → O → E → IZ (s) → 0. We have c1 (E) = s and
c2 (E) = s(s + 1)/2 = deg(Z). Since h1 (O) = 0 and IZ (s) and O are globally generated, E
also is globally generated. For a ≥ 0 let us consider a section of E(a): 0 → O → E(a) →
IΓ (2a + s) → 0. For k ≥ a + s, IΓ (k) is globally generated and we can link Γ to Σ by a
complete intersection of type (k, k). By mapping cone we get, if k = 2a + s:
(12)

0 → E(−3a − 2s) → 3.O(−2a − s) → IΣ → 0

We have c2 (E(a)) = as + s(s + 1)/2 + a2 = deg(Γ). It follows that τ := deg(Σ) = 3a2 +
3as + s(s − 1)/2. Since d1 = a + s (E := E(−a − s)), it is easy to check that τ = τ+ .
Let d be an integer. Assume d odd, d = 2δ + 1. For 1 ≤ ρ ≤ δ, set a = δ − ρ, s = 2ρ,
d1 = a + s and d = 2a + s + 1. Then the construction above yields Σ of degree τ+ , q.c.i. of
three curves of degree d − 1, with d1 = a + s. We have δ + 1 ≤ d1 ≤ 2δ.
If d = 2δ, for 0 ≤ ρ ≤ δ − 1, set a = δ − ρ − 1 and s = 2ρ + 1 (d1 = a + s).

Remark 15. It is not clear at all that there are examples with Σ a jacobian set. For
some partial results see [6], section 4.
It is possible to give a little improvement, namely:

Proposition 16. Assume 2d1 + 1 > d and τ = τ+ − 1. Set s := 2d1 − d. Then we have
two possibilities:
(a) The minimal free resolution of IZ is:
(13)

0 → O(−s − 2) ⊕ (s − 2).O(−s − 1) → s.O(−s) → IZ → 0

In this case m = 2d1 − d + 1 and di = d1 , ∀i.
(b) The minimal free resolution of IZ is:
(14)

0 → O(−s − 2) ⊕ (s − 1).O(−s − 1) → O(−s − 1) ⊕ s.O(−s) → IZ → 0

In this case m = 2d1 − d + 2 and di = d1 , 2 ≤ i < m, dm = d1 + 1.
Proof. Arguing exactly as above this time we have deg Z = h0 (O(s−1))+1, h0 (IZ (s−1)) =
L
L
0, hence h1 (IZ (s − 1)) = 1. Let 0 → t O(−βj ) → t+1 O(−αi ) → IZ → 0 denote the
minimal free resolution of IZ . Since β + > α+ (β + = max{βj } and the same for α+ ) and
since β + − 3 = max{k | h1 (IZ (k)) 6= 0}, we see that β + = s + 2 (with coefficient equal to
1 because h1 (IZ (s − 1)) = 1). It follows that H∗0 (IZ ) is generated in degrees ≤ s + 1. Of
course we have s minimal generators of degree s and in general nothing else (it is easy to
produce examples for any s). We conclude that in this case the resolution is like in (a).
What about generators of degree s + 1 ? If there at least two such generators, then
the matrix of the resolution has two rows of the form (L, 0, ..., 0). By erasing another row,
we get a maximal minor which is zero, but this is impossible (the maximal minors are the
generators). So there is at most one generator of degree s + 1. In this case the resolution is
like in (b). Examples exist for any s: take s + 1 points on a line and the remaining ones in
general position.
