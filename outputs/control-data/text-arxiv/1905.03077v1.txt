NEARLY PARALLEL G2 -STRUCTURES WITH LARGE SYMMETRY
GROUP
FABIO PODESTÀ
Abstract. We prove the existence of a one-parameter family of nearly parallel G2 structures on the manifold S3 × R4 , which are mutually non isomorphic and invariant
under the cohomogeneity one action of the group SU(2)3 . This family connects the two
locally homogeneous nearly parallel G2 -structures which are induced by the homogeneous
ones on the sphere S7 .

1. Introduction
A nearly parallel G2 -structure (NP-structure for brevity) on a 7-dimensional manifold M
is given by a positive 3-form ϕ ∈ Ω3 (M) such that dϕ = λ ∗ϕ ϕ for some (non-zero) λ ∈ R,
where ∗ϕ denotes the Hodge star operator relative to the associated Riemannian metric g.
The name “nearly parallel” comes from the fact that only a 1-dimensional component of
∇ϕ is different from zero (see [14]), where ∇ is the Levi Civita connection of g, and these
structures are also said to have weak holonomy G2 , where this terminology goes back to
Gray ([19]). The Riemannian manifold (M, g) is irreducible Einstein with scalar curvature
2
given by 21
8 λ and the existence of an NP-structure is equivalent to the existence of a
spin structure with a non-zero Killing spinor as well as to the existence of a torsion-free
Spin(7)-structure on the cone C(M) := R+ × M inducing the cone metric dr 2 + r 2 g (see
[4]). More precisely, an NP-structure on a compact simply connected manifold M will be
called proper if the cone metric on C(M) has full holonomy H = Spin(7), or equivalently
if the space of Killing spinors is one-dimensional. When the NP-structure is not proper
and the metric g has not constant curvature, the holonomy H reduces either to SU(4) or
further to Sp(2), corresponding to the existence of a Sasakian (but not 3-Sasakian) and a
3-Sasakian stucture on M respectively. It is known (see [18]) that any 3-Sasakian manifold
admits a second NP-structure which is proper and the squashed sphere S7 is an example of
this situation.
In some sense NP-structures are a seven-dimensional analogue of nearly Kähler structures
in six dimensions, which are automatically Einstein and admit a Killing spinor. Actually
the cone metric on the cone over a six-dimensional strict nearly Kähler manifold N has
holonomy inside G2 and moreover for both nearly Kähler and NP-structures their canonical
metric connections ∇ have ∇-parallel, totally skew-symmetric torsion. It is also known that
given a six-dimensional strict nearly Kähler manifold N, the cone C(N) endowed with the
sine-cone metric has an NP-structure (see e.g. [6]).

In order to find possibly new examples, it is very natural to investigate manifolds endowed
with special structures, as nearly Kähler or NP-structures, whose full automorphism group
is ample. The classification of compact homogeneous NP-structures was achieved in [18],
where also many useful results were proved on the full automorphism group, while later
in [11] the classification of compact homogeneous nearly Kähler six-dimensional manifolds
was obtained. In [24],[25] the study of compact six-dimensional nearly Kähler manifolds
which admit a compact Lie group of automorphisms with generic orbits of codimension
one was initiated and more recently Foscolo and Haskins ([16]) proved the existence of
completely new, inhomogeneous nearly Kähler structures on the sphere S6 and on S3 × S3 ,
invariant under the cohomogeneity one action of the group SU(2) × SU(2). As for NPstructures, Cleyton and Swann ([12]) classified all manifolds which carry such a structure
with a simple Lie group of automorphisms acting by cohomogeneity one; in strong contrast
to the homogeneous case, they found that the standard sphere S7 and RP7 acted on by the
exceptional Lie group G2 are the only complete examples.
In this work we investigate the existence of G-invariant NP-structures on the manifold
M ∼
= S3 × R4 , which admits a cohomogeneity one (almost effective) action of the group
G = SU(2)3 . The manifold M can be realized as the complement M = S7 \ Σ, where
Σ ∼
= S3 is one the two singular orbits for a cohomogeneity one action of G on S7 , and
it is special in the sense that it already admits a complete G-invariant metric with full
holonomy G2 , namely the well-known example constructed by Bryant and Salamon ([10])
on the spin bundle over S3 . The group G appears in the list of possible groups with can act
by cohomogeneity one preserving a G2 -structure ([12]) and actually it is (locally) isomorphic
to the full isometry group of the Bryant-Salamon metric. Moreover, in view of the results in
[18], the automorphism group of an NP-structure on a compact manifold acts transitively
on it whenever its dimension is at least 10, so that the group G has the highest possible
dimension to allow non-homogeneous examples. Principal G-orbits are diffeomorphic to
Y := S3 × S3 and the non-trivial isotropy representation of a principal isotropy subgroup
allows to easily determine the space of invariant 2- and 3-forms on M. A G-invariant NPstructure on Mo ∼
= R+ × Y given by a 3-form ϕ induces a family of so called nearly half-flat
G-invariant SU(3)-structures (ω, ψ+ , ψ− ) on Y (see [15]); the 2-form ω is forced to lie in a
one-dimensional subspace of invariant 2-forms on Y and when these SU(3)-structures are
all nearly Kähler structures on Y we obtain the well-known example of the sine-cone over
the homogeneous nearly Kähler manifold Y (see [5],[15]).
In our main result Theorem 4.1 we prove the existence of a one-parameter family Fa
(a ∈ R+ ) of G-invariant NP-structures on M, mutually non isomorphic, connecting the two
locally homogeneous NP-structures on M induced by the known homogeneous NP-structures
on S7 ; the parameter a ∈ R+ gives a measure of the size of the singular orbit S3 . The problem
of understanding which of these structures extends over a G-equivariant compactification
M is unsolved, albeit there is some numerical evidence that no such structure might exist
besides the homogeneous ones. In case a global G-invariant NP-structure on S7 should
exist, we prove that it would be proper and distinct from any of the Einstein metrics of
cohomogeneity one on S7 found by Böhm ([7]). One might expect to find more invariant
NP-structures by reducing the group to SU(2)2 × U(1), by analogy with what happens for

G2 -holonomy metrics on M (see the recent results in [17]), or further to SU(2)2 and this
can be the object of further investigations.
The work is structured as follows. In the second section we describe the manifold M together with the G-action as well as all the G-invariant G2 -structures. In section 3 we write
down the equations defining the G-invariant NP-structures. We continue describing the special solutions to the system (3.3) given by the sine-cone construction over the nearly Kähler
homogeneous manifold S3 × S3 and by the two well-known homogeneous NP-structures on
S7 . We then analyze the symmetries of the system (3.3), providing (Prop.3.5) the existence
of a two-dimensional family of mutually non isomorphic and non locally homogeneous NPstructures on an open tubular neighborhood of a G-principal orbit. In the last subsection
of section 3, we give sufficient and necessary conditions on the solutions of the system (3.3)
on the regular part so that the corresponding NP-structures extend smoothly to an NPstructure on the whole M. In the last section we prove our main Theorem 4.1 and the main
properties of a global solution in Prop.4.6.

2. Preliminaries
In this section we first consider the non-compact 7-dimensional manifold M together with
the action of the group G ∼
= SU(2)3 with generic orbits of codimension one. We will then
describe the space of all G-invariant G2 -structures on M.
2.1. The manifold M and the group action of G. We start with the standard (almost
effective) action of the compact group U = Sp(2) × Sp(1) on H2 given by (A, q) · v = Av q̄,
where (A, q) ∈ U and v ∈ H2 . The sphere S7 ⊂ H2 can be written as the quotient space
U/K+ with K+ = {(diag(q, q ′ ), q) ∈ U} ∼
= Sp(1) × Sp(1) being the isotropy subgroup at the
point e1 = (1, 0) ∈ H2 .
We consider the action of G := {(diag(q1 , q2 ), q3 ) ∈ U| q1 , q2 , q3 ∈ Sp(1)} ∼
= Sp(1)3 on S7 .
7
The curve γ : t 7→ (cos t, sin t) ∈ S is transverse to the G-orbits and we easily see that
Gγ(t) = Sp(1)diag =: H
Gγ(0) = K+ ,

t ∈ (0, π/2),

Gγ(π/2) = {(q, q ′ , q ′ ) ∈ G} =: K− .

It then follows that G acts on S7 by cohomogeneity one with principal orbits diffeomorphic
to S3 × S3 . We also fix an Ad(H)-invariant decomposition
g = h ⊕ V + ⊕ V − , m := V + ⊕ V −

where
V + := {(X, −2X, X)| X ∈ sp(1)},

V − := {(−2X, X, X)| X ∈ sp(1)}.
Note that k± = h ⊕ V ± . We fix the standard basis of sp(1) ∼

h := 0i −i

with

[h, e] = 2v, [h, v] = −2e, [e, v] = 2h
and we consider the maps j± : sp(1) → V ± given by j+ (X) = (X, −2X, X) and j− (X) =
(−2X, X, X). We then define a basis of m as follows
e2 := j+ (h), e3 := j+ (e), e4 := j+ (v),
e5 := j− (h), e6 := j− (e), e7 := j− (v).
We consider the manifold M := G ×K+ H, where K+ acts on H via its standard representation. Then M can be identified with S7 \ (G · γ( π2 )) and it is an R4 -bundle over the singular
orbit G · γ(0) = G/K+ ∼
= S3 , namely it is diffeomorphic to S3 × R4 . The regular open
subset Mo of M is G-equivariantly diffeomorphic to (0, π2 ) × G/H. In the open manifold
b . Along the curve γ we have a
Mo we can identify the tangent spaces Tγ(t) Mo = Rγ ′ (t) ⊕ m
frame, again denoted by {e1 , . . . , e7 }, that is given by Bt := {γ ′ (t), ê2 |γ(t) , . . . , ê7 |γ(t) } and
its dual coframe will be denoted by {e1 , . . . , e7 }. For basic information on cohomogeneity
one manifolds we refer e.g. to [1], [2].
2.2. Invariant G2 -structures. We start recalling some basic facts about G2 -structures.
Given a 7-dimensional manifold M and its frame bundle L(M ) → M , a G2 -structure is
a reduction of L(M ) to a subbundle P with structure group G2 ⊂ SO(7). It is known
that G2 -structures are in one to one correspondence with smooth sections of the associated
bundle Λ3+ (M ) := L(M ) ×GL(7,R) Λ3+ (R7 ) ⊂ Λ3 (M ), where Λ3+ (R7 ) ⊂ Λ3 (R7 ) is the open
orbit GL(7, R) · ϕo through a 3-form ϕo with stabilizer GL(7, R)ϕo = G2 (see e.g.[18],[8]). A
smooth section ϕ of Λ3+ (M ) (hence a G2 -structure on M) determines a Riemannian metric
gϕ as follows: at each point p ∈ M we consider the non-degenerate symmetric bilinear map
1
bϕ : Tp M × Tp M → Λ7 (Tp M ∗ ), (v, w) 7→ ιv ϕ ∧ ιw ϕ ∧ ϕ
6
1
and if {v1 , . . . , v7 } is any basis of Tp M with dual basis {v , . . . , v 7 } then for i, j = 1, . . . , 7
bϕ (vi , vj ) = βϕ (vi , vj ) v 1 ∧ . . . ∧ v 7

for some non-degenerate matrix Bϕ := (βϕ (vi , vj ))i,j=1,...,7 ; the Riemannian metric gϕ is
then given by (see e.g. [20])
gϕ (vi , vj ) = (det(Bϕ ))−1/9 βϕ (vi , vj ).
In order to investigate G-invariant G2 -structures on M = G ×K+ H, we start considering
invariant G2 -structures on the open dense submanifold Mo .
The description of G-invariant 3-forms on Mo is reduced to the study of the space of
H-invariant 3-forms Λ3 (V ∗ ), where V := Re1 + m ∼
= Tγ(t) M (t ∈ (0, π2 )). We first note that
Λ3 (V ∗ )H ∼
= Λ2 (m∗ )H + Λ3 ((V + )∗ ) + Λ3 ((V − )∗ )+

+[Λ2 ((V + )∗ ) ⊗ (V − )∗ ]H + [(V + )∗ ⊗ Λ2 ((V − )∗ )]H .

Using the standard notation ei1 i2 ...ik = ei1 ∧ . . . ∧ eik , we immediately see that the space
Λ2 (m∗ )H is generated by the form ω := e25 + e36 + e47 and that the space Λ3 (V ∗ )H is
generated by the invariant 3-forms
e1 ∧ ω, ϕ1 := e234 , ϕ2 := e567 , ϕ3 := e237 − e246 + e345 , ϕ4 := e267 − e357 + e456 .
If we denote by ϕ a G-invariant 3-form on Mo , its restriction along γ can be written as

ϕ|γ(t) = f0 e125 + e136 + e147 + f1 e234 + f2 e567 + f3 e237 − e246 + e345 +

+ f4 e267 − e357 + e456 ,

for suitable fi ∈ C ∞ ((0, π2 )). Let us fix the volume form e1234567 along γ, so that we get
an identification Λ7 (V ∗ ) ∼
= R. Then, the matrix Bϕ associated with the symmetric bilinear
form bϕ with respect to Bt is given by (here I denotes the 3 × 3-matrix)


In this case, we will suppose that the parameter t is the arc length parameter along the curve
γ (hence throughout the following the parametr t will vary in some interval I = (0, T )), i.e.
b1 := f1 f4 − f32 , b2 := f2 f3 − f42 , b3 :=

so that det(Bϕ ) = −f027 or equivalently

operator w.r.t. gϕ . We easily obtain

Using (2.2), we see that A = 12 f0−3 . Consequently, the 4-form ∗ϕ ϕ can be rewritten as

∗ϕ ϕ = 3 e1 ∧ [(f12 f2 − 3 f1 f3 f4 + 2 f33 ) e234 − (f1 f22 − 3f2 f3 f4 + 2f43 ) e567

− f02 (e2356 + e2457 + e3467 ).

In order to compute dϕ, we need some preliminary remarks. First of all we note that
Λ4 (V ∗ )H = Re1 ∧ Λ3 (m∗ )H + [Λ2 ((V + )∗ ) ⊗ Λ2 ((V − )∗ )]H ,
where the last summand is generated by the invariant form α := e2356 + e2457 + e3467 . The
next lemma follows by straightforward computations.
Lemma 2.1. We have the following commutators for x, y ∈ sp(1)
[j± (x), j± (y)]m = −j± ([x, y]),
[j+ (x), j− (y)]m = j+ ([x, y]) + j− ([x, y]).
Using the standard Koszul’s formula for the differential of an invariant form ψ ∈ Λk (m)H ,
namely for X0 , X1 , . . . , Xk ∈ m
X
dψ(X0 , X1 , . . . , Xk ) =
(−1)i+j ψ([Xi , Xj ]m , . . . , X̂i , . . . , X̂j , . . . , Xk ),

(here the hat denotes omitted terms) we see that
dϕ1 = dϕ2 = 0, dω = 6(ϕ3 − ϕ4 ), dϕ3 = dϕ4 = 6α.
Therefore we obtain

3. Invariant Nearly parallel G2 -structures and their equations
Recall that a G2 -structure is nearly parallel if the defining 3-form ϕ satisfies the equation
(3.1)

dϕ = λ ∗ϕ ϕ,

for some non-zero real constant λ. In this case, the Riemannian metric gϕ induced by ϕ is

Einstein with scalar curvature Scal(gϕ ) = 21
8 λ . We now consider a G2 -structure induced by
a G-invariant 3-form ϕ, which can be described as in (2.1). Then ϕ defines an NP-structure
if and only if f0 , f1 , f2 , f3 , f4 satisfy the following equations

Lemma 3.1. Equations (6) and (7) in (3.3) hold for all t ∈ I if and only if they hold at
one point in I and equations (1)-(5) are satisfied for all t ∈ I.
As an immediate corollary, we note that the algebro-differential system (3.3) can be
reduced to the system of ODE’s formed by equations (1)-(5) in (3.3) coupled with initial
conditions at a fixed point to ∈ I satisfying equations (6) and (7) at to , together with the
inequalities (8). We will use this point of view when we will construct families of mutually
non-isometric and non locally homogeneous NP-structures in a suitable neighbourhood of
homogeneous solutions, which we describe in the following subsection.
Remark 3.2. Note that under the rescaling ϕ 7→ c · ϕ (c 6= 0), we have gcϕ = c2/3 · gϕ and
the constant in (3.1) λ 7→ c−1/3 λ. This means that we can always fix λ to be any non zero
real number. Alternatively, one can consider new functions
f˜0 (t) := λ2 f0 (t/λ), f˜i (t) := λ3 fi (t/λ), i = 1, . . . , 4
which satisfy the system (3.3) with λ = 1.
Remark 3.3. It is well known that, given a manifold X endowed with an NP-structure
with 3-form ϕ and associated Riemannian metric g, a hypersurface f : S → X inherits a
so-called nearly half-flat SU(3)-structure given by a 2-form ω and a 3-form ψ+ so that
ω := ıν ϕ, ψ+ := −ıν ∗ ϕ, ψ− := Jψ+ = −f ∗ ϕ,
where ν denotes the unit normal to S and J is the almost complex structure induced on
S by the SU(3)-structure (ω, ψ+ ) (see [15]). This nearly half-flat structure (ω, ψ+ ) satisfies
the condition
dψ− = −2ω ∧ ω,
when the 3-form ϕ satisfies dϕ = 4 ∗ ϕ (i.e. λ = 4). In our situation the G-invariant
nearly half-flat structures induced on the principal orbit G/H = S3 × S3 have proportional
2-forms ω, as the isotropy representation of H forces the space of invariant 2-forms to be
one-dimensional.
Viceversa given a smooth family of nearly half-flat structures (ω(t), ψ+ (t))t∈R on a 6dimensional manifold S, the 3-form ϕ := ω ∧ dt − ψ− on R × S defines an NP-structure

In [27] it is proved that starting from a nearly half-flat structure on S it is possible to
extend it to a smooth one-parameter family of nearly half-flat structures satisfying (3.4),
hence obtaining an NP-structure on I × S for some interval I ⊆ R (see also [13]). We will
prove a local existence result in Proposition 3.5.

3.1. Particular solutions. In this subsection we will describe three special solutions to
the system (3.3), corresponding to known NP-structures. More precisely they are the sinecone over the homogeneous nearly Kähler manifold S3 × S3 and the two homogeneous
NP-structures on the sphere S7 .
(a) It is known (see [5],[6]) that the sine-cone Cs (Y ) = (0, π) × Y over a nearly Kähler
6-dimensional manifold Y carries an N P -structure inducing the sine-cone metric dt2 +sin2 t·
gY . The homogeneous nearly Kähler structure on S3 × S3 is known to be invariant under
the group SU(2)3 (see [11]) and therefore it gives rise to a solution (f0 , . . . , f4 ) of the system
(3.3) for t ∈ (0, π), namely

λ = 4, f0 (t) = −2 3(sin t)2 , f1 (t) = f2 (t) = 8(sin t)4 ,

4I −2I
The metric gY is represented by the block matrix −2I 4I .
(b) We consider the standard NP-structure P1 on S7 , inducing the standard constant
curvature metric. Its full automorphism group is Aut(P1 ) = Spin(7) ⊂ SO(8). We consider
the octonions O = {a + be, a, b ∈ H} together with the Cayley form Φ ∈ Λ2 O given by
1
Φ(x, y, z, w) = hx, [y(z̄w) − w(z̄y)]i.

It is known that the group Sp(1) × Sp(1) × Sp(1) acting almost faithfully on O by
(q1 , q2 , q3 ) · (a + be) = q1 aq̄3 + (q2 bq̄3 )e
preserves the form Φ (see [9], p.11) and therefore induces a cohomogeneity one action on
the round sphere S7 preserving the standard NP-structure ϕ given by ϕx := ıx Φ, x ∈ S7 . If
we consider the curve γ(t) = cos t + sin t · e ∈ O, we see that the corresponding functions
fi (t) are given by
λ = 4, f0 (t) = −9 sin t cos t,

f1 (t) = 27 sin4 t, f2 (t) = 27 cos4 t, f3 (t) = f4 (t) = −27 sin2 t cos2 t.

The metric can be represented by the block matrix 0 aI 0 where a = 9 sin2 t, b = 9 cos2 t.

automorphism group given by Aut(P2 ) = Sp(2) · Sp(1) ⊂ SO(8). We refer to the exposition
in [3], §8.2, where the authors describe this homogeneous structure using the presentation
of S7 as a normal homogeneous space of the group Sp(2) · Sp(1).

3.2. The functions fi ’s and the associated nearly parallel structures. A solution
(f0 (t), . . . , f4 (t)) of the system (3.3) defines an NP-structure on the open subset J × G/K
for some subinterval J ⊆ I. In this subsection we study the problem when two such NPstructures are (locally) isomorphic. We start with the following proposition, which follows
very closely Prop. 4.1 in [25], and characterizes the local homogeneity of a G-manifold with
a G-invariant NP-structure.
Proposition 3.4. Let X be a 7-dimensional manifold endowed with an NP-structure given
by a 3-form ϕ. Assume that the group G ∼
= SU(2)3 acts on X by automorphisms of the
G2 -structure by cohomogeneity one and assume moreover that the NP-structure is locally
homogeneous. Then (X, ϕ) is locally (isometrically) isomorphic to the standard sphere or
to the squashed sphere endowed with their respective NP-structures.
Proof. We fix p ∈ X and we consider the Lie algebra s of germs of automorphisms of (X, ϕ)
with isotropy subalgebra at p denoted by u. Then it is known that u is reductive and that
it embeds into g2 . Moreover, by local homogeneity, we may suppose that p is G-regular,
hence u contains u1 := u ∩ g ∼
= su(2), the isotropy subalgebra gp . Therefore, looking at the
list of possible reductive subalgebras of g2 , we see that u can be isomorphic to su(2), su(3),
R + su(2), su(2) + su(2), g2 . Let S be the simply connected Lie group with Lie algebra
s and let U be the connected Lie subgroup of S with Lie algebra u. We claim that U is
closed in S, whence X is locally isomorphic to a globally homogeneous space (see e.g. [26]).
Suppose on the contrary that U is not closed in S. This implies that u is not semisimple
(see [22], p.615), hence u ∼
= R + su(2) and therefore u = u1 + R. As u is reductive, we
can write s = u + V , where V ∼
= R7 is ad(u) invariant and ad(u)|V ⊂ su(3). Therefore
s
ad |u1 = ρ1 ⊕ ad ⊕ 4R, where ρ1 is the standard representation of u1 on C2 . On the other
hand u1 ⊂ g ⊂ s with codims g = 2 and therefore ads |u1 = 3 ad ⊕2R, a contradiction.
A direct inspection of the globally homogeneous (hence compact) manifolds with Ginvariant NP-structure (see [18]) and admitting a cohomogeneity one action of G proves
our claim.

P4
P4 ˜
Let ϕ =
i=0 fi ϕi and ϕ̃ =
i=0 fi ϕi be two G-invariant NP-structures, where the
˜
˜
5-tuples (f0 , . . . , f4 ), (f0 , . . . , f4 ) satisfy the system (3.3) on some interval J ⊆ I. Assume
then that these two structures are locally isomorphic, i.e. there are two open subsets
f ⊆ J × G/H and a diffeomorphism ψ : W → W
f with ψ ∗ ϕ̃ = ϕ (and therefore inducing
W, W
an isometry between the induced metrics g and g̃ respectively). We will first suppose that ψ
does not map G-orbits onto G-orbits. As G acts with cohomogeneity one, this means that
f are locally homogeneous and therefore, by Prop.3.4, locally isometric to
both W and W
the standard or squashed sphere. As the full automorphisms of the two homogeneous NPstructures on S7 , namely Spin(7) and Sp(2)·Sp(1), contain precisely one copy of SU(2)3 up to
f→W
f preserving ϕ̃ and with ψ̃∗ (ψ∗ (g)) = g.
conjugation, we can find a local isometry ψ̃ : W

NEARLY PARALLEL G2 -STRUCTURES WITH LARGE SYMMETRY GROUP

11

Therefore we are reduced with the case where ψ preserves G-orbits. Up to some traslation
by an element of G and up to some reparameterization t 7→ t+c, we can suppose ψ(γt ) = γ±t .
If ψ(γt ) = γ−t , we can compose ψ with the transformation (t, xH) 7→ (−t, xH) reducing to
ψ(γt ) = γt ; the corresponding transformation of the functions fi ’s reads
(3.5)

τo : (f0 (t), f1 (t), f2 (t), f3 (t), f4 (t)) 7→ (−f0 (−t), f1 (−t), f2 (−t), f3 (−t), f4 (−t)).

The map ψ induces an automorphism ψ∗ of the Lie algebra g that preserves the regular
isotropy h, as ψ preserves the curve γt . If ψ∗ is inner, it is the conjugation by an element
n ∈ NG (H), n = σ · h with h ∈ H and σ = (σ1 , σ2 , σ3 ) where σi = ±Id ∈ SU(2). It then
follows that Ad(g) fixes ω as well as all ϕ1 , . . . , ϕ4 , so that the functions f0 , f1 , . . . , f4 remain
unchanged. We now examine the case where ψ∗ is outer, namely it permutes the simple
factors fi ∼
= su(2), i = 1, 2, 3 of g. We now describe how the functions ϕi ’s transform when
ψ∗ induces the generators (12) and (13) of the symmetric group S3 .
Suppose ψ∗ permutes the factors fi leaving f3 fixed. Then we easily see that ω 7→ −ω,
while ϕ1 , ϕ2 are exchanged as well as ϕ3 , ϕ4 . The functions fi ’s transform accordingly as
follows
(3.6)

τ(12) : (f0 , f1 , f2 , f3 , f4 ) 7→ (−f0 , f2 , f1 , f4 , f3 ).

When ψ∗ induces the permutation (13) on the factors of g, we can compute the corresponding transformation of the invariant forms as follows
ω 7→ −ω, ϕ1 7→ ϕ1 − ϕ2 − ϕ3 + ϕ4 , ϕ2 7→ −ϕ2

ϕ3 7→ −ϕ3 − 3ϕ2 + 2ϕ4 , ϕ4 7→ ϕ4 − 3ϕ2
so that the corresponding trasformation of the functions fi ’s reads

(3.7) τ(13) : (f0 , f1 , f2 , f3 , f4 ) 7→ (−f0 , f1 , −f1 − f2 − 3(f3 + f4 ), −f1 − f3 , f1 + 2f3 + f4 ).

Using these, we see that the remaining non-trivial permutations induce the following
trasformations
τ(23) :(f0 , f1 , f2 , f3 , f4 ) 7→ (−f0 , −f1 − f2 − 3(f3 + f4 ), f2 , f2 + f3 + 2f4 , −f2 − f4 ).

(3.8) τ(123) :(f0 , f1 , f2 , f3 , f4 ) 7→ (f0 , −f1 − f2 − 3(f3 + f4 ), f1 , f1 + 2f3 + f4 , −f1 − f3 ).
τ(132) :(f0 , f1 , f2 , f3 , f4 ) 7→ (f0 , f2 , −f1 − f2 − 3(f3 + f4 ), −f2 − f4 , f2 + f3 + 2f4 ).

3.3. Local Existence. We consider the regular ODE system given by equations (1)-(5)
(for a fixed λ) in (3.3). Any solution of such a system is a curve in R5 lying in the subset
C := {(a0 , a1 , . . . , a4 ) ∈ R5 | a0 6= 0, 0 > a1 a4 − a23 , 0 > a2 a3 − a24 , R1 = 0, R2 = 0}

that corresponds to the initial values at to of the homogeneous structure P1 on the sphere S7
with constant λ = 4. In a suitable neighborhood W of xo the set C ∩ W is a 3-dimensional
submanifold, as it can be easily verified. Moreover if Σ is the group of transformations in
R5 generated by τ(12) , τ(13) , we can shrink W so that τ (W ) ∩ W = ∅ for every τ ∈ Σ. Now if
F (t) is the (homogeneous) solution starting from xo , we can fix a 2-dimensional submanifold
S in C ∩ W that is transversal to the trace of F ; solutions starting from points in S are
all mutually non equivalent and not locally homogeneous. Therefore we have proved the
following
Proposition 3.5. There exists a 2-dimensional family of mutually non equivalent and not
locally homogeneous G-invariant NP-structures on the space J ×G/H for some open interval
J ⊂ R.

3.4. Extendability over the singular orbit G/K+ ∼
= S3 . We aim at finding necessary
and sufficient conditions on the functions fi so that the 3-form ϕ and the corresponding
metric gϕ extend smoothly over one singular orbit G · p = G/K+ ∼
= S3 , where p = γ(0).
We first remark that when ϕ extends smoothly over the singular orbit, then ϕγ(t) (êi , êj , êk )
is smooth in a neighborhood of the origin; therefore, as all Killing vector fields in V + vanish
at p, we have

On the tubular neighborhood of the singular orbit G/K+ given by G ×K+ p, the 3-form
ϕ defined by (2.1) on the complement of the zero section is completely determined
by its
V
restrition to p. Therefore we can see ϕ as a K+ -equivariant map ϕ̂ : p \ {0} → 3 (p∗ + s∗ ),
which is fully determined by its restriction to the curve γ(t) = (t, 0, 0, 0) ∈ p. We can
write down the components of ϕ̂|γ(t) (t 6= 0) along each of the four K+ -summands in the

27t3

and therefore we may consider the K+ -equivariant map p → p∗ whose restriction to γ is
1
given by 27t
3 f1 (t) dt for t 6= 0. This extends smoothly on the whole p if and only if f1 (t)

is an even smooth function of t with f1 (0) = f1′′ (0) = 0 (indeed f1t(t)
must extend smoothly
4
and we already know that f1 is even
and

(b) Along the trivial K+ -module 3 s∗ we obtain the component
π2 ◦ ϕ̂|γ(t) = −

1
(f1 + 8f2 + 6f3 + 12f4 ) w1 ∧ w2 ∧ w3 .
27

Since w1 ∧ w2 ∧ w3 is K+ -invariant, the extendability condition in this case boils down to
the condition that f1 + 8f2 + 6f3 + 12f4 must be even. This follows from the fact each fi
is even for i = 1,
V. . . 4.
(c) Along p∗ ⊗ 2 s∗ we obtain the component
π3 ◦ ϕ̂|γ(t) =

1
(f1 + 4f3 + 4f4 ) (dx2 ∧ w2 ∧ w3 − dx3 ∧ w1 ∧ w3 + dx4 ∧ w1 ∧ w2 ).
27t

This case can be handled in two different ways. First we note that K+ contains the normal
subgroup I = {(1, q, 1) ∈ K+ | q ∈ Sp(1)} which still acts transitively on the unit sphere
in p, but trivially on the orbit G/K+ . Using the subgroup
V I we can determine the full
expression of ϕ̂ and check that its component along p∗ ⊗ 2 s∗ extends smoothly over the
whole p if and only if t12 (f1 + 4f3 + 4f4 ) extends smoothly over t = 0. This last condition
is automatic as we are supposing f1 , f3 , f4 to beVeven functions vanishing at t = 0. The
second approach considers the K+ -module p∗ ⊗ 2 s∗ ∼
= p∗ ⊗ s ∼
= Q1 ⊕ Q2 , where Q1 ∼
=p
8
+
and Q2 ∼
= R is the real part of the complex K -irreducible representation C2 ⊗ S3 (C2 )
(here K+ ∼
= SU(2)1 × SU(2)2 acts on C2 via SU(2)1 and on S3 (C2 ) via SU(2)2 ). Since the
space Q2 does not contain any non-zero fixed point vector under the action of the subgroup
Sp(1) ∼
= H ⊂ K+ , the element dx2 ∧ w2 ∧ w3 − dx3 ∧ w1 ∧ w3 + dx4 ∧ w1 ∧ w2 belongs to the
submodule Q1 ∼
= p and therefore we can consider this component of ϕ̂ as a K+ -equivariant
map into p, leading to the same conclusion as above.

f0 is odd and f1 , f3 are even, the condition can be written as limt→0 2f
9t − 27t2 = 0 or
equivalently, using the fact that f1 = O(t4 ) by (a),

6f0′ (0) = f3′′ (0).

(3.10)

It can be easily checked that the conditions on the extendability of the other components
of π4 ◦ ϕ̂ are all equivalent to (3.10).
Summing up, the 3-form ϕ on the regular part Mo extends on the whole tube G ×K+ p
if and only if the functions fi extend smoothly around t = 0 with the following properties:
(3.11)

f1′′ (0) = 0;

i = 1, 2, 3, 4.

i = 1, 3, 4;
6f0′ (0) = f3′′ (0).

When these conditions hold, the 3-form ϕ extends smoothy at the singular point with the
expression
ϕp = A w1 ∧ w2 ∧ w3 + B (dx0 ∧ dx1 ∧ w1 + dt ∧ dx2 ∧ w2 + dt ∧ dx3 ∧ w3

+ dx1 ∧ dx2 ∧ w3 + dx2 ∧ dx3 ∧ w1 − dx1 ∧ dx3 ∧ w2 ),

f2 (0) and B := − 92 f0′ (0). Now, it is not difficult to check that the 3-form
where A := − 27
V
ϕp is stable (i.e. the orbit GL(Tp M) · ϕp is open in 3 Tp M∗ ) if and only if A · B < 0 and
in this case the induced metric is positive definite, coinciding with the limit metric gϕ at p.
Therefore we need to consider the non-degenerancy condition

(3.14)

f2 (0) · f0′ (0) < 0.

Actually, if we use (3.11),(3.12),(3.13) and (7)-(8) in (3.3), we see that f2 (0) · f0′ (0) ≤ 0, so
that the only condition we need to add is
(3.15)

f2 (0) 6= 0,

Therefore we have proved the following

f0′ (0) 6= 0.

Proposition 3.6. Let ϕ be a G-invariant 3-form on Mo whose restriction to the curve
γ(t) (t 6= 0) has the expression (2.1). Assume that the form ϕ defines an NP-structure, so
that the functions fi′ s satisfy the algebro-differential system (3.3). Then the form ϕ extends
smoothly to a G-invariant 3-form on M defining an NP-structure on M if and only if the
functions fi ’s extend smoothly around t = 0 fulfilling the conditions (3.11), (3.12), (3.13),
(3.15).
4. The Main Theorem
In this section we will prove the existence of a one-parameter family of NP-structures on
M. In particular we will prove our main theorem, namely
Theorem 4.1. There exists a one parameter family Fa , (a ∈ R+ ) of NP-structures on
M. These structures are mutually non isomorphic and not locally homogeneous, with the
exception of two of them, which are locally isomorphic to the structures P1 and P2 on S7 .

Remark 4.2. The parameter a ∈ R+ measures the size of the singular orbit S3 .

The proof of Theorem 4.1 will be achieved through several steps in this section. We know
how to describe G-invariant NP-structures on the open dense subset Mo of G-regular points,
which identifies with the complement of the zero section in the bundle G ×K+ H. Given
a G-invariant 3-form ϕ on Mo which defines an NP-structure, we considered its expression
(2.1) along a transversal curve γ and we could derive the algebro-differential system of
equations (3.3) the functions fi ’s in (2.1) have to satisfy. Moreover we found necessary and
sufficient conditions in terms of the functions fi ’s so that the NP-structure on Mo extends
smoothly to a global G2 -structure on M . Now instead of solving for the functions fi ’s, in
view of Proposition 3.6 we may look for smooth even functions hi defined on some interval
(−ε, ε), ε ∈ R+ , so that
(4.1)

f0 = t · h0 , f1 = t4 · h1 , f2 = h2 , f3 = t2 · h3 , f4 = t2 · h4 ,

Note that

If we set ai := hi (0), i = 0, . . . , 4, then the extendability conditions (3.11),(3.12),(3.13),

Proposition 4.3. The functions fi ’s as in (2.1) define a G-invariant NP-structure on
M = G ×K+ H (with fixed constant λ) if and only if there exist smooth even functions
h0 , h1 , h2 , h3 defined on some interval (−ε, ε), (ε ∈ R+ ), satisfying the equation (4.7) for
t 6= 0 with initial condition at t = 0 given by h̄ = (h0 (0), . . . , h3 (0)) with

for some a ∈ R, a 6= 0.
Proof. It is enough to prove the “if” part. We clearly define the fi ’s in terms of the hi ’s
using (4.1). Then the fi ’s satisfy the differential system (3.3) (1)-(5) on the open set Mo ,

NEARLY PARALLEL G2 -STRUCTURES WITH LARGE SYMMETRY GROUP

while we have to prove that the algebraic conditions (3.3) (6)-(7) are also satisfied. By
Lemma 3.1 the two quantities
F1 := f4 + f3 +

F2 := f06 − (f1 f4 − f32 ) (f2 f3 − f42 ) + (f1 f2 − f3 f4 )2

are actually constant on the open set t 6= 0 and both vanish at t = 0, hence they vanish
everywhere. Moreover condition (4.2) are also satisfied, so that the functions fi ’s define an
NP-structure which extends to a G2 -structure on the whole M.

We now prove the existence in the following
Lemma 4.4. The equation (4.7) admits a unique solution h = (h0 , . . . , h3 ) which is smooth
in an interval (−ε, ε) for (ε ∈ R+ ) and satisfies the initial conditions (4.9). Moreover, the
functions h0 , . . . , h3 are even.
Proof. We use Theorem 4.7 in [16] (see also [7]), which asserts that the singular initial value
problem we are considering has a unique smooth solution provided the following conditions
are fulfilled:
a) A(h̄) = 0;
b) dA|h̄ − l · Id is invertible for all l ∈ N, l ≥ 1.

Condition (a) has been already fixed, while we can easily compute

whence
det(dA|h̄ − l · Id) = l(l + 4)(l2 + 7l + 6) > 0,

l ≥ 1.

Therefore for any a 6= 0, we obtain a unique solution (h0 (t), . . . , h3 (t)) of the singular system
(4.7) with initial data h̄. The fact that the solutions hi are even follows from uniqueness
and the fact that B(h, −t) = −B(h, t) for all (h, t) ∈ R4 × R.

We now investigate the question when two NP-structures determined by two solutions
h, h̄ are isomorphic. By the results obtained in §3.2, we see that the associated functions
f := (fi )i=0,...,4 and f¯ := (f¯i )i=0,...,4 are related by a transformation τ in the group generated
by τ12 , τ13 . A simple check shows that τ (f ) = f¯ satisfies the extendability conditions
(3.11),(3.12),(3.13), if and only if τ = τ13 . This transformation is equivalent to reversing
a 7→ −a in (4.9) and therefore we can restrict to a > 0. This concludes the proof of the
main Theorem 4.1.
Remark 4.5. The two (locally) homogeneous solutions (with λ = 1) correspond to the
values a = 36 (round sphere) and a = 108
5 (squashed sphere), as it can be easily seen using
§3.1 and the remark 3.2 (recall that the opposite value of a gives the same NP-structure).

We conclude this section pointing out some features of a possible G-invariant NP-structure
in the family Fa on M which extends to a global one on some G-equivariant compactification
M. Note that M is diffeomorphic to either S7 or to S3 × S4 .
Proposition 4.6. Any NP-structure in the family Fa , a > 0, which extends to a global
NP-structure on some G-equivariant compactification M and has not constant curvature is
proper, namely the relative cone metric has full holonomy Spin(7).
Proof. Let (M, g, ϕ) be a G-invariant NP-structure extending some element in Fa , say for
a = ā, and with g of non-constant curvature. We will denote by G the connected component
of the full isometry group of (M, g). We can also suppose that G does not act transitively
on M. Indeed, if M ∼
= S7 , it is well known that there are precisely two homogeneous
Einstein metrics, which correspond to the round and the squashed sphere (see e.g. [29]). If
M∼
= S3 × S4 , using a result by Kamerich (see [23], p. 274), G contains a transitive subgroup
N locally isomorphic to SU(2)×SO(5), acting on M in a standard way. Now any N-invariant
Riemannian metric on M is reducible, while g is irreducible.
Now, as M is compact and simply connected, our claim follows if we show that the
holonomy H of the cone metric on M × R+ is not SU(4) nor Sp(2).
(a) We prove that H 6= SU(4), i.e. that (M , g) does not carry any Sasakian structure which
is not part of a 3-Sasakian structure. If ξ is the unit length Killing vector field giving the
Sasakian structure, a classical theorem by Tanno ([28]) states that ξ belongs to the center
of g, since g has non-constant curvature. On the other hand the isotropy representation of
K+ at p has no non-trivial fixed vector, forcing ξp = 0, a contradiction.
(b) We now suppose that (M , g) carries a 3 Sasakian structure given by a Lie algebra
s∼
= sp(1) generated by three unit length Killing vector fields ξ1 , ξ2 , ξ3 . Again by a result
due to Tanno ([28]) we know that the Lie algebra g splits as a sum of ideals g = go ⊕ s,
where go is the centralizer of s in g. As G is supposed to act non-transitively on M, it has
the same orbits as its subgroup G. In particular, G acts transitively on S3 × S3 .
Lemma 4.7. The semisimple part gs of g is isomorphic to 3su(2) or to 4su(2).
Proof. The isotropy subalgebra f of gs at a G-regular point q embeds as a compact subalgebra of so(6). Looking at the list of maximal subalgebras in so(6), we see that dim f ≤ 7,
unless f ∼
= so(5) or su(3), u(3). If f contains a copy of su(3), it acts transitively on the
unit sphere of Tq (Gq), hence Gq ∼
= S3 × S3 has contant curvature, a contradiction; the case
∼
f = so(5) can be ruled out using a result about the gaps in the dimension of the isometry
group of a Riemannian manifold (Thm. 3.3. in [21]). Therefore dim f ≤ 7 and dim gs ≤ 13.
On the other hand, G contains a subgroup isomorphic to SU(2)2 that acts on Gq (almost)
freely; therefore by a result in [23], Cor.3, p. 237, the algebra gs contains an ideal a isomorphic to 2su(2). Then gs = a ⊕ b for some other semisimple ideal b. As g ⊆ gs and
1 ≤ dim b ≤ 7, we see that b is isomorphic to 2su(2) or to su(2) and our claim follows. 
Suppose now gs = 4su(2). This implies that the semisimple part of go , say l, is isomorphic
to 3su(2). As [l, s] = 0, the isotropy lq leaves a 3-dimensional subspace fixed, hence dim lq ≤
3. This implies that dim Lq = 6, where L is the subgroup with Lie algebra l. Then L has
the same orbits as G and leaves each ξi fixed, a contradiction by the same arguments used

in (a). Therefore we are left with gs = 3su(2) = g, i.e. the ideal s is one of the three ideals,
say s1 , s2 , s3 of g. If we denote by gi (t), i = 1, 2, 3 the functions
g1 (t) := ||ê2 ||2γ(t) , g2 (t) := ||ê5 ||2γ(t) , g3 (t) := ||ê2 + ê5 ||2γ(t) ,

we are reduced to considering the three possibilities when gi are constant functions.
The condition g1 (t) = f32 − f1 f4 = const can be easily ruled out using Prop.4.3 and (4.1).
Moreover under the admissible transformation τ13 the function g2 goes over to g3 , so that
we can confine ourselves to the case g2 (t) = const. Using Maple we can write the series
expansion of the solutions fi ’s as well as of the function g2 (t) for λ = 1 obtaining

g2 (t) = a2 + (−

Therefore if g2 is constant we immediately get a = 36, − 108
5 , which correspond to the known
homogenous solutions. This concludes the proof.

Remark 4.8. By the previous result, we can also show that none of the non-homogeneous
Einstein metrics in the family F, whenever extended to S7 , is one of the metrics found by
Böhm in [7]. Indeed assume g is a metric in the family F which is also in the Böhm’s family.
The NP-stucture associated to g is proper, hence its full isometry group preserves the NPstructure and therefore has dimension less or equal to 9 by Thm. 7.1 in [18]. On the other
hand the metrics found in [7] are invariant under a bigger group, namely SO(4) × SO(4).
