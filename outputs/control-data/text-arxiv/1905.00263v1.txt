Abstract
We consider constrained multi-Hamiltonian formulation for the extended Chern-Simons theory with higher derivatives of
arbitrary finite order. The order n extension of the theory admits (n − 1)-parametric series of conserved tensors. The 00component of any representative of the series can be chosen as Hamiltonian. The theory admits a series of Hamiltonian
formulations, including the canonical Ostrogradski formulation. The Hamiltonian formulations with different Hamiltonians
are not connected by canonical transformations. Also, we demonstrate the inclusion of stable interactions with charged scalar
field that preserves one specified Hamiltonian from the series.

1 Introduction
The Hamiltonian formulations for theories with higher derivatives have been discussed once and again for decades since
the work of Ostrogradski [1]. The procedure for constructing such Hamiltonian formulation for degenerate theories was
originally proposed in [2]. This procedure and its modifications can be applied to study different gauge theories, including
gravity (see [3, 4]). The canonical Ostrogradski Hamiltonian used in all these methods is not bounded. It leads to the wellknown stability problem and difficulties with constructing of quantum theory [5–7].
The alternative Hamiltonian formulation was first introduced in the Pais-Uhlenbeck theory [8, 9]. In the work [10], it
was noticed that a wide class of theories with higher derivatives admits the series of Hamiltonians and the Poisson brackets
that are not connected with each other by canonical transformations. The canonical Ostrogradski Hamiltonian is included
in the series. The series of non-canonical Hamiltonian formulations was constructed explicitly in [11, 12] for the extended
Chern-Simons theory [13] of the third and fourth order.
In the present work, we consider the Hamiltonian formulation for the extended Chern-Simons of arbitrary finite order. At
free level, the theory of order n admits (n − 1)-parametric series of Hamiltonian formulations with Hamiltonian being the
00-component of any conserved tensor from the series [14]. We demonstrate that non-Lagrangian interaction vertices with

charged scalar field constructed in [15] preserve one representative in the series of Hamiltonian formulations, and the theory
remains stable at the interacting level.
The rest of the article is organized as follows. In section 2, we provide a general information about the extended ChernSimons, including the equations of motion and conserved tensors. In section 3, we construct the multi-Hamiltonian formulation for the theory. The calculations here are mostly based on the techniques of working with Hankel and Bezout matrices
that can be found in [16]. In section 4, we consider the Hamiltonian formulation in the case of inclusion of interaction with
charged scalar field.

2 The extended Chern-Simons of order n
The extended Chern-Simons theory of order n is a class of models of vector field A = Aµ (x)dxµ , µ = 0 , 1 , 2 , on 3d

The action functional (1) and equations of motion (2) are invariant under the standard gradient gauge transformation for the

The series of second-rank conserved tensors for the theory (1) was constructed in [14]. The most general representative

where α = (α1 , . . . , αn ) are parameters of the Lagrangian, and real numbers β = (β1 , . . . , βn ) are parameters of the
series. We use the notation

F (r) = m−1 ∗ d r A ,

r = 1, ... ,n − 1,

and F (0) µ ≡ Aµ . The square matrix Cr,s (α , β) , r , s = 1 , . . . , n , is determined by the generating relation

The Cr,s (α , β) (5) is known as the Bezout matrix of the polynomials M (z) , N (u) [16]. Let us note that polynomial

is so called characteristic polynomial of the theory (1) [14]. We get it by formal substitution of variable z to the Lagrange
equations (2) instead of the Chern-Simons operator ∗d .
The conserved tensors of the model (1) are defined as coefficients for parameters β1 , . . . , βn in the series (3):
T (r)µν (α) =

∂Tµν (α , β)
,
∂βr

r = 1, . . . , n .

(8)

By construction, T (1) µν (α) is the canonical energy-momentum for (1), while T (r)µν (α) , r = 2 , . . . , n − 1 , are another
independent conserved quantities. The quantity T (n) µν (α) (8) is a linear combination of other conserved tensors by identity

However, we consider T (n) µν (α) as it is convenient for the inclusion of interactions. Decomposition of an arbitrary representative of the series (3) in the basis independent generators T (r) µν (α) , r = 1 , . . . , n − 1 , (8) reads
Tµν (α , β) =

The canonical energy-momentum is always included in the series (3). It corresponds to the following values of the parameters:
β1 = 1 ,

β2 = β3 = . . . = βn = 0 ,

(11)

while other values of β1 , . . . , βn in (3) define non-canonical conserved quantities.
The 00-component T00 (α , β) of the conserved tensor (3) reads
T00 (α , β) =

n−1
X

Cr,s (α , β)(F (r) i F (s) i + F (r) 0 F (s) 0 ) ,

(12)

r,s=1

where i = 1 , 2 , and the summation over repeated at the same level indices is implied. This quantity is a quadratic form of
the variables (4), and it is positive definite if the matrix Cr,s (α, β) (5) is positive definite. A possible existence of bounded
representatives in the series (12) is defined by the structure of roots of the characteristic polynomial: the bounded tensor exists
if all the non-zero roots of the characteristic polynomial are real and different, and zero root has the multiplicity 1 or 2 [14].
In terms of the polynomial M (z) (6) it is sufficient to require that all its roots are real and different. The canonical energy of
the theory (1) is included in the series (12) with the parameters (11), and it is always unbounded when n > 2 .

3 Hamiltonian formulation of the extended Chern-Simons
In this section we show that the theory (2) admits (n − 1)-parametric series of the canonically inequivalent Hamiltonian
formulations, and almost any representative in the series of conserved quantities (12) can be chosen as Hamiltonian. For
doing this, we first lower the order of the equations (2) to the first in time t = x0 derivatives and then present the Poisson
brackets and Hamiltonian that reduce this equations to the Hamiltonian form.
Let us introduce new variables that absorb time derivatives of the original vector field Aµ , using spatial components of
one-form F (r) i , i = 1 , 2 , r = 1 , . . . , n − 1 (4). Then the first-order formulation for (1) reads
∂0 F (0) i = ∂i A0 − mεij F (1) j ;

We can verify the equivalence of the equations (2) and (13) – (16) as follows. The formulas (13), (14) express the auxiliary
variables F (1) i , i = 1 , 2 , r = 1 , . . . , n − 1 , in terms of derivatives of A . After excluding all the variables, equations (15)
and (16) reproduce spatial and temporal part of the equations of motion (2), respectively. Let us note that in the first-order
formalism the quantity Θ (16) does not involve time derivatives and can be considered as a constraint.
The first-order system of equations (13) – (15) is Hamiltonian if there exists the Hamiltonian H(α , β) and Poisson

Here, the sign ≈ means that both sides of the equation are equal modulo the constraint Θ (16). Introducing the parameters β ,
we take into account that different Hamiltonian formulations can exist for one and the same equations of motion. We choose
the following ansatz for the Hamiltonian:

and Θ is the constraint (16). We use the constants k0 , k1 , . . . , kn−1 in the Hamiltonian (18) for the reasons of convenience
and define them later.
The Poisson bracket is determined from the condition that the equations (13) – (15) take the form (17) with the Hamiltonian (18). It is equal to the following system of equations for the unknown Poisson bracket and parameters k0 , k1 , . . . , kn−1 :

The compatibility conditions (28) for the equations (20) – (22) have a simple physical interpretation. The first relation is
equivalent to the nondegeneracy of the Hamiltonian quadratic form (18). The second relation guarantees that the constraint
Θ (16) generates gauge symmetries for the vector potential A .
We use the relations

to verify that formulas (23) – (25) represent the solution of the equations (20) – (22). These conditions are satisfied, because
adjugate for the Bezout matrix Cr,s (α , β) (5) is the Hankel matrix constructed from polynomials (6). The proofs of this
relations can be found in [16].
Formulas (17), (18), (23) – (25) define a series of Hamiltonian formulations for the extended Chern-Simons theory (1).
An arbitrary representative in this series is determined by 2n + 1 parameters α1 , . . . , αn , β1 , . . . , βn , γ . The constants
α1 , . . . , αn are parameters of the model (1), and real numbers β1 , . . . , βn−1 define a representative in the series of the
conserved quantities (3) that will be chosen as Hamiltonian. The quantities βn , γ are auxiliary parameters: βn can be always
absorbed by redefining parameters β1 , . . . , βn−1 , and constant γ determine a specific representative in the equivalence class
of the Poisson brackets (23) – (25). The Poisson brackets for the physical observables do not depend on the value of γ . The
total number of the independent parameters that lead to the inequivalent Hamiltonian formulation of the model (1) is n − 1 ,
so the extended Chern-Simons theory admits (n − 1)-parametric series of Hamiltonian formulations.
For all the admissible parameters in the Hamiltonian, the Poisson bracket is a nondegenerate tensor

To arrive to the relations (33), (34), we need to use the inversion formula for the Hankel matrix of the Poisson brackets
from [16]. The formulas (32) – (34) allow us to systematically reproduce the symplectic structure if the Hamiltonian of the
theory is given.
The canonical Ostrogradski Hamiltonian formulation [1] is reproduced by the formulas (18), (32) – (33) with the following
values of the parameters in the Hamiltonian:
β1 = 1 ,

β2 = β3 = . . . = βn = 0 ,

obvious, that canonical Hamiltonian action (36) is not equivalent to the general representative in the series (32), because the
canonical Hamiltonian is always unbounded, while in general the bounded representatives are admissible.

The first two of these conditions guarantee that the Hamiltonian is nondegenerate in a free limit, while the last one provides
the existence of gauge U (1)-transformation for the scalar field. A case with β1 = 0 it is supposed to be special and is not
considered in this work. So, it is shown that almost all the constructed in [15] interactions admit Hamiltonian formulation.
This Hamiltonian formulation is canonically inequivalent to the Ostrogradski formulation, as all the original equations are
non-Lagrangian.
Let us illustrate the general construction of the Hamiltonian formulation using the extended Chern-Simons of the third
order coupling to the massless charged scalar. In this case, the equations of motion (37) read

Here, we use the notation

The Hamiltonian (62) and Poisson brackets (63) – (68) are well-defined, whenever
det C(α , β) 6= 0 ,

β1 6= 0 ,

e 6= 0 .

Then ϕ = π = e = 0 , the vector field dynamics split off, and formulas (56) – (58), (63) – (67) reproduce one of the admissible
representatives in the series of Hamiltonian formulations for free extended Chern-Simons theory of the third order [11] . This
establishes correspondence with the previous results.

5 Conclusion
We have seen that at free level the extended Chern-Simons theory of order n is multi-Hamiltonian, and it admits (n − 1)parametric series of non-canonical Hamiltonian formulations with 00-component of any representative of (n − 1)-parametric
series of conserved tensors as the Hamiltonian. For the certain range of the parameters of the theory, there exist the bounded
representatives, otherwise all the Hamiltonians in the series are unbounded. The stability condition is defined by the positive
definiteness of the matrix Cr,s (α, β) (5). The series includes the canonical Hamiltonian formulation with always unbounded
Ostrogradski Hamiltonian. Only one of these Hamiltonians survives then we include the non-Lagrangian interactions with
charged scalar [15]. Its parameters are defined by the values of the coupling constants. It allows us to preserve the stability and
consistently quantize the theory at the interacting level. This work was conducted within a government task of the Ministry
of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, project No.3.9594.2017/8.9.
