In the realm of functional materials, the production of two-dimensional structures with tunable
porosity is of paramount relevance for many practical applications: surfaces with regular arrays of
pores can be used for selective adsorption or immobilization of guest units that are complementary
in shape and/or size to the pores, thus achieving, for instance, selective filtering or well-defined
responses to external stimuli. The principles that govern the formation of such structures are valid
at both the molecular and the colloidal scale. Here we provide simple design directions to combine
the anisotropic shape of the building units – either molecules or colloids – and selective directional
bonding. Using extensive computer simulations we show that regular rhombic platelets decorated
with attractive and repulsive interaction sites lead to specific tilings, going smoothly from closepacked arrangements to open lattices. The rationale behind the rich tiling scenario observed can be
described in terms of steric incompatibilities, unsatisfied bonding geometries and interplays between
local and long-range order.

INTRODUCTION

The interest in self-assembled monolayers stems from
the variety of technological applications they can be
designed for. At the molecular scale [1–4], properties
such as corrosion resistance, surface superhydrophobicity, or antifouling are imparted to surfaces via closepacked tilings, while porous surface networks are at the
basis of the so called two-dimensional host-guest chemistry [1–4]. At the colloidal scale, while close-packed
tilings are mostly used as lithographic masks [5, 6] or as
seeds for the so-called colloidal epitaxy [7], open lattices
offer many possibilities for the rational design of selective
membranes [8, 9] or two-dimensional materials with optical, magnetic, electronic or catalytic properties [10–12].
The formation of complex surface patterns at the
molecular scale relies on the hierarchical assembly of organic functional molecules to self assembled monolayers on solid substrates, such as graphite or metallic surfaces [13, 14]. Such assemblies of molecular species that
lie flat on relatively inert substrates mostly result from
reversible non-covalent interactions: self-similar, fractal
aggregates, nonporous – ordered as well as disordered –
networks and even quasi-crystalline patterns emerge due
to hydrogen [14–18] or halogen [19, 20] bonding or van der
Waals interactions [21, 22]. Beyond the atomic details,
a combination of simple factors fully describes the selfassembly of many different surface patterns: the geometric features of the building units, such as the aspect ratio
or the rotational symmetry of the molecules, together
with the placement of the bonding groups and possible

energy differences between binding groups mostly determine the features of the assembled monolayers [23–25].
For instance, the assembly of elongated organic molecules
functionalized with four carboxyl groups on a graphene
surface can be described by rhombic platelets with four
interactions sites [23]: molecules of this type bind to
each other in two possible orientations (parallel and nonparallel) and the steric incompatibilities between rombic
platelets – combined with the presence of bonding sites in
suitable arrangements – are able to reproduce the directionality of the bonds between the carboxyl groups (see
panels (A) to (F) in Fig. 1).
The same principles are applicable at the colloidal
level. Nowadays, monodisperse non-spherical particles
at the nano- and micro-scale are largely available [26–
30], thus allowing to create a vast variety of structures
with different symmetries and packing densities [31–33].
While two-dimensional hard shapes form entropically
stabilized lattices that tend to maximize edge-to-edge
contact [34–36], the presence of surface binding groups
introduces a competition between entalphy and entropy
that can stabilize open architectures [35].
While the self-assembly of surface structures can be
studied by synthesizing many candidate building blocks
with different geometries and interactions in the laboratory, computer simulations of simple models offer an
efficient way to reveal the basic principles governing the
assembly process.
The great advantage of such a numerical approach is
that it allows to quickly explore a huge parameter space
without the need to manufacture the – possibly unsuccessful – building units and for this reason computer
simulations have been used extensively in materials design [23, 25, 34, 35].
Here, we propose a class of anisotropic planar units
provided with a fixed and low number of interaction cen-

2
ters and we investigate how the tiling ability of these
units depends on the nature and the arrangement of the
interaction centers using Monte Carlo (MC) Simulations.
Within this framework, specific porous structures – with
target pores – can be stabilized with respect to others,
just by taking advantage of few selected characteristics.
While porous monolayers with a specific pore size have
been achieved – experimentally as well as in simulations
– by a careful blending of selected features (such as the
anisotropy of the particle shape and/or bonding patterns) [23, 34, 35, 37] our approach shows how to switch
continuously from an open to a close-packed tiling.

Simulation details

Particle model

In this work we explore the assembly products of regular hard rhombi in two dimensions with four squarewell interaction sites (referred to as patches) of either
one type denoted as four-equal (feq) or of two types
denoted as double-manta, double-mouse and checkers
(dma/dmo/checkers). Patches of the same kind attract
each other with strength − and patches of a different
kind repel each other with .
The interaction potential between two hard rhombi i
and j is 0 whenever they do not overlap and infinity if
they do overlap:

if i and j do overlap.
where ~rij is the distance vector, and Ωi and Ωj denote the
particle orientations. The patches exhibit an attractive
or repulsive square-well type potential:

where pij is the patch-patch distance vector, 2rp is

of the hard particle potential requires a collision detection
check between pairs of particles using the separating axis
theorem [38] (for convex particles only). In summary,
the MC-evaluation of the total energy consists of a collision detection check and the subsequent calculation of
the patch pair potential.
For
every
class
of
patch
specificities
(feq/dma/dmo/checkers) we explore different patch
topologies, which enables us to explore the patch parameter space systematically (see Appendix A for details
on the different topologies). For all studied topologies
we are able to describe the specific patch positioning
with one variable, ∆. Table I gives a full overview of the
particle parameters.

To model the absorption of platelets on a surface we
choose the grand canonical ensemble (µV T ) with single
particle rotation and translation moves and particle insertion and deletion. To avoid kinetic traps we implement
cluster moves [39, 40] (see Appendix B for details). The
shape of the rectangular box is chosen such that a closepacked tiling of rhombi fits fully. The used system parameters are summarized in table II. We follow the same
procedure in all investigated systems: after equilibration
of 3 × 105 MC-sweeps in a regime of very low packing
fractions of φ ≈ 0.05 with µeq , we increase the chemical
potential to µ∗ to observe the assembly. In total we perform 8 simulations per state point (, ∆). The number
of MC-sweeps until equilibration varies from system to
system and lies between ≈ 1.2 × 106 − 2.0 × 107 MCsweeps (see Fig.4 in Appendix D). Typical system sizes
of the completed assemblies are in the range of N ≈ 1000
with N as the number of particles, while the area is fixed
A = 1000 · sin (60◦ ). Numerical values of the system parameters are given in the supporting information. We
characterize the emerging tilings with the randomness
parameter hΨi of the largest cluster, averaged over all
simulation runs (see panel (G) of Fig. 1, panel (B) of
Fig. 3 and Fig. 7 in Appendix F).

same for each system and the final density of each sample is system-dependent (see Fig. 4 in Appendix D).

RESULTS
Feq systems

The starting point of our explorations is the patchy
rhombi system introduced by Whitelam et al. [23] to describe the assembly of small organic TPTC molecules ((pterphenyl-3,5,3’,5’- tetracarboxylic acid, see panel (A) of
Fig. 1) on graphite. In general, tectons or building blocks
of tetracarboxylic acids adsorb flat (with their aromatic
backbone parallel to the substrate) on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite due to π stacking interactions [14, 16, 41–
43].
In Ref. [23], TPTC molecules are modeled as hard regular rhombi (with internal angles 60◦ and 120◦ ) decorated with four patches that mimic the hydrogen bonding
groups: each patch is placed at the center of an edge, adjacent rhombi can bond together only via their patches
and all pairs of bonded patches bear the same energy.
Despite the simplicity of the model referred to as feqcenter (four equal patches at the edge centers), the assembly of these units on a featureless two-dimensional
substrate successfully reproduced [23] the assembly of
TPTC molecules into a random rhombus tiling [16]. The
randomness of a tiling is measured by a suitably designed
order parameter Ψ [14]., that goes from +1 (p) to -1 (np),
where Ψ = 0 is the perfect random tiling (see Methods
for the definition of Ψ). The feq-center system is our
starting and reference point: it forms a nearly perfect
random tiling with Ψ ≈ 0. We note that, while Whitelam et al. observed a slightly non-parallel tiling with
hΨw. et al. i = −0.08 ± 0.05, in our simulations we obtain
a slightly parallel tiling, i.e., hΨfeq-center i = 0.02 ± 0.04
(see panels (C) and (G) of Fig. 1). These two values are
comparable within their error bars.
While the effect of perturbing the aspect ratio of the
rhombi has been investigated in Ref. [23], little is known
on the effect of the patch topology on the tiling motifs. At
the molecular scale, a change in the patch topology can
be achieved by considering different tectons of tetracarboxylic acids. In order to describe 3,3,3’,5’-azobenzene
tetracarboxylic acid (NN4A) molecules [43], for instance,
we can consider regular rhombi with two of the patches
placed at the center of opposite edges and the other two
patches positioned symmetrically out of center in opposite direction with respect to each other (see panel (D)
of Fig. 1); we refer to units with this patch topology as
feq-asc (four equal patches with an asymmetric and a
centered pair of opposite patches). The same approach
can be used for other tectons of tetracarboxylic acids on
graphite [14, 16, 41–43], resulting in different patch arrangements.
Within our model, regular rhombi can be arbitrarily
decorated with four equal patches along the edges. To
systematically explore this – in principle infinite – parameter space, we describe each particle type by one single parameter ∆ and a patch topology (see Methods and
Fig. 1 for the definition of the different topologies).

In panel (H) of Fig. 1 (upper part) we show the resulting tilings for all six patch topologies with ∆ = 0.2,
corresponding to the most extreme off-center cases (for
a larger view on the systems see Fig. 4 in Appendix D).
The visual analysis of the simulation snapshots suggests
that four of six tilings yield close-packed lattices, while
two lead to open tilings.

1.

Closed-packed feq tilings

The four closed-packed tilings are characterized by
very different degrees of randomness: at ∆ = 0.2,
hΨfeq-s1 i = −0.854 ± 0.095, hΨfeq-s2 i = 0.155 ± 0.064.,
hΨfeq-sc i = 0.725 ± 0.032 and hΨfeq-as1 i = 0.617 ± 0.030
(see panel (G) of Fig. 1). The differences between these
tilings can be understood by considering small clusters
of particles, reported in panel (H) of Fig. 1 (lower part).
Essentially, the degree of randomness of a tiling rises with
the compatibility of these small clusters with p- and npbonding arrangements. While at the two-particle level
all four patch topologies can bond parallel (p) as well
as non-parallel (np), already at the three- and then fiveparticle level, bonding configurations with either unsatisfied bonds or particle overlaps emerge.
In the feq-s1 system the small cluster analysis shows
that p-clusters larger than two are not possible due to
overlaps, leading to a mostly np-tiling. We note that,
even though the long-range order is purely non-parallel
hΨfeq-s1 i =
6 −1 due to the presence of grain boundaries
between different np-domains. In contrast, in the feqs2 both p- and np-bonding arrangements are compatible
with local as well as long-range order, resulting in a random tiling. It is worth noting that, in this case, too many
tiling possibilities make a hole-free tiling highly unlikely.
Finally, feq-sc and feq-as1 are characterized by the presence of large p-domains connected to each other within
a roof-shingle motif: in the first case clusters with unsatisfied bonds emerge at the level of five-particle clusters, while in the second case clusters with unsatisfied
bonds emerge already at the level of three-particle clusters. When ∆ is increased from 0.2 towards 0.5 (see panel
(G) of Fig. 1), all random tilings monotonically collapse
into the nearly perfect random tiling corresponding to
the feq-center one. In general as ∆ grows towards 0.5
a closer analysis of the configurations shows a growing
commensurability of the various local bonding patterns.
Moreover, the number of defects – i.e., the number of
holes in a close-packed tiling – reduces as ∆ grows towards 0.5 (see panel (G) of Fig. 1).

2.

Open feq tilings

A different scenario emerges for feq-as2 and feq-asc, for
which open lattices are formed. The differences between
these tilings can be understood by considering small clusters of particles, reported in panel (H) of Fig. 1 (lower

5
part). As the small cluster analysis highlights (see panel
(H) of Fig. 1), both patch topologies allow the formation
of p- and np-clusters with holes that are able to tile and
ultimately yield open tilings.
The emerging parallel tilings are characterized by either an open pattern with rhombic pores – denoted as optiling – (in the case of feq-as2) or by a closed-packed brick
pattern (in the case of feq-asc); in contrast both nonparallel tilings are open lattices characterized by hexagonal and triangular pores – denoted as onp-tilings. Note
that the pore size of both tilings is dependent on ∆, with
pores largest at the extremes, i.e., at ∆ = 0 and ∆ = 1,
while at ∆ = 0.5 the pores close and the systems collapse
to the random tiling of feq-center.
In feq-as2, open p- and np-clusters grow next to each
other within the same sample leading to hΨfeq-as2 i =
−0.439 ± 0.332 for ∆ = 0.2. However, it is important
to note that for such an extreme ∆-value p- and npdomains are highly incompatible and avoid contact by
paying a high energy price, hence we cannot classify this
as a random tiling (see snapshot in FIG. 1, panel (H)).
On increasing ∆, a non-monotonous behavior is observed
(see panel (G) of Fig. 1): first hΨfeq-as2 i drops down and
then rises again to reach the value of the nearly perfect
random tiling at ∆ = 0.5. The sweet spot for the formation of the onp-tiling is observed at ∆ = 0.3, where
hΨfeq-as2 i = −0.600 ± 0.332. At this ∆-value, three of 16
runs show a pure onp-tiling, while the other 13 runs retain the coexistence between p- and np-domains (see the
corresponding simulation snapshot in panel (H) of Fig. 1
and Fig. 4 in Appendix D).
In contrast, the sweet spot for the formation of the
onp-tiling for feq-asc is observed at ∆ = 0.2, where
hΨfeq-asc i = −0.854 ± 0.095. In this case, on increasing
∆, the trend towards the nearly perfect random tiling at
∆ = 0.5 is monotonous (see panel (G) of Fig. 1).
In both systems p- and np-domains become more commensurable as ∆ increases. While at ∆ = 0.2, the energy
price related to the coexistence of p- and np-domains is
high, at ∆=0.4 we already observe fully bonded domains
with mixed orientation. It is worth noting that the energy price for such a coexistence is not only related to
the patch arrangement but also to the bonding energy
(see Appendix E for details).
Within our description, NN4A molecules can be depicted as feq-asc particles with ∆ = 0.3: for such a system, even though both p- (4-p-brick) and np- (3-np-off)
arrangements are allowed (see panel (E) of Fig. 1), we observe the formation of an open tiling with a very strong
onp-component (in the snapshot reported in panel (F) of
Fig. 1, Ψfeq-asc = −0.590946). This result is consistent
with experimental data [43].

B.

Dma/Dmo/Checkers systems

Within our minimal design approach, we propose to
take into account the role of the patch identity. Tricar-

boxylic acid molecules on a gold surface were shown, for
instance, to assemble into different structures according
to their deprotonation level [44]. By playing with the
pH, e.g., two types of interaction centers might be induced, whose relative abundance is determined by the
deprotonation process.
We thus consider now patchy rhombi with two kinds
of patches for any patch arrangement (given again by a
patch topology and a ∆-value, see Fig. 2 and Methods for
a detailed description). To describe how different tilings
arise from the underlying patch topologies, we refer to
Fig. 2 and divide results into three groups: center, symmetric off-center and asymmetric off-center patch topologies.
In general, we note that the off-center tilings are symmetric with respect to ∆ = 0.5. Within a specific offcenter topology, the tiling geometry is – most of the time
– preserved over the whole ∆-range. However, in most
cases, the particles yielding those tilings are not the same,
but some are equivalent to each other (see Fig. 2 and the
Methods section).

1.

Tilings of center topologies.

We consider systems where patches are placed in the
edge center (∆ = 0.5), referred to as dma-center, dmocenter and checkers-center. All particle types yield closepacked, space-filling tilings, but each patch topology induces specific tiling features (see the corresponding simulation snapshots in Fig. 2, upper part) characterized by
very different values of hΨi.
Similar to feq-center, dma-center yields an almost perfect random tiling with hΨdma−center i = 0.03 ± 0.05 (see
panel (B) of Fig. 3). As the small cluster analysis highlights, both p- and np-bonding arrangements are compatible with long-range order: the double manta specificity
allows for multi-particle p-, np- as well as mixed clusters
at any cluster size (see the corresponding panel in Fig.2,
lower part).
A different degree of randomness is observed
in dmo-center, where p-bonds dominate leading to
hΨdmo−center i = 0.52 ± 0.02 (see panel (B) of Fig. 3).
In this case, although both p- and np- pair bonds are
allowed, closed loops of np-bonds (in the following referred to as boxes [23]) induce an energetic penalty (see,
e.g., the 3-np configuration in the corresponding panel
of Fig. 2, lower part). This restricts the phase to either
p-clusters (see, e.g., the 4-p configuration), roof-shingles
(see, e.g., the 8-p&np configuration) or mixtures of those.
Note however, that the close-off on roof-shingle motives
inevitably induces either energetic penalties (see, e.g.,
the 9-p&np configuration) or defects (see the simulation
snapshots in the corresponding panel of Fig. 2, upper
part, whenever three orientations coalesce).
We note that the spatial distribution of p- and npbonds – and the degree of randomness of the resulting
tiling – can be quantified also by the average size of p- or

FIG. 2: Upper row: Simulation snapshots of resulting tilings for double manta (dma), double mouse (dmo) and checkers. The
reference patch topologies for these classes of rhombi – namely, dma-center, dmo-center and checkers-center – are reported
above the snapshots. For each class of particles, the columns show the different patch topologies (s1, s2, sc, as1, as2, and asc,
each represented in the corresponding inset on the tiling snapshots) and the rows the different patch positions, determined by
∆ (as labeled). The color of the particles in the snapshots highlights their orientation. Lower row: for each particle type, we
consider small clusters with all bonds satisfied (yellow), with overlaps (gray) and with unsatisfied bonds (burgundy). When
particles are the same by rotation or exchange of particles (see legend) small clusters are not shown. Configurations are labeled
according to the number of particles in the cluster (from 2 up to 9), their bond arrangement – parallel (p), non-parallel (np)
or mixed (p&np)– and their respective positions – edge-to-edge (no label) or brick-like (brick). In few cases we use -r and -b
to distinguish two-particle clusters with bonds between either red or blue patches. We note that the chemical potential is the
same for each system and the final density of each sample is system-dependent.

i (see panel (C) in Fig. 3 and Fig. 7 in

Appendix F).
A completely different lattice is observed for checkerscenter. As patches of the same kind sit on opposing
edges, only p-bonds are possible without energetic penalties for all ∆ values (see configuration 2-p versus 2np in the corresponding panel of Fig. 2, lower part).
Checkers-center yields a defect-free close-packed p-tiling
with hΨcheckers−center i = 1.00 (see panel (B) of Fig. 3).

2.

np-tilings are observed with hΨdma−s1 i = hΨdma−s2 i =
−1.00 – within the error bars – over the whole ∆-range
(see panel (B) of Fig. 3). In contrast, in dmo-s1/s2,
just as in dmo-center, the formation of boxes is energetically disfavored and, additionally, the formation of
roof-shingle motifs is not possible due to the offset edge
contact. Hence, dmo-s1/s2 do not form any coherent
tiling.

Tilings of symmetric off-center topologies.

Dma and dmo symmetric off-center topologies result in
very different tilings compared to their respective center
topologies: placing the patches symmetrically off-center
in those systems leads to p-bonds with offset edge contacts. Such a bonding arrangement forbids the growth of
multi-particle p-clusters in both classes of systems (see
the small cluster analysis in the corresponding panels
of Fig. 2, lower part, where particle overlaps are highlighted). As in dma-s1/s2 the formation of boxes is
still possible (see, e.g., the 5-np configuration in the
corresponding panels of Fig. 2, lower part), defect-free

A completely different tiling scenario is observed for
checkers-sc: In checkers-sc, besides a full-edge-contact ptiling (see cluster 4-p in the corresponding panel of Fig. 2,
lower part), off-center patch positioning additionally allows for an offset p-tiling brick configuration (see cluster 4-p-brick in the corresponding panel of Fig. 2, lower
part). Subsequently, checkers-sc form a p-tiling with occasional brick-like defects; note that hΨcheckers−sc i = 1.00
over the whole ∆-range (see panel (B) of Fig.3) as npbonding between two platelets is energetically disfavored
(see cluster 2-np in the corresponding panel of Fig. 2,
lower part).

Tilings of asymmetric off-center topologies.

The visual analysis of our results clearly suggests that
the as1 topology does not lead to any tiling (see the corresponding simulation snapshots in Fig. 2, upper part):
both dma-as1 and dmo-as1 allow the formation of fully
bonded p- and np-clusters of two and three particles respectively, but these are unable to tile due to overlaps
(see the corresponding small cluster analysis in Fig. 2,
lower part).
In contrast to checkers-sc, checkers-asc – defined by
placing patches of one type asymmetrical, while patches
of the other type remain in the center – can only assemble
into a brick-tiling (see clusters 2-p-r and 2-p-b that merge
into cluster 4-p-brick in the corresponding panel of Fig. 2,
lower part) with hΨcheckers−asc i = 1.00 over the whole ∆range (see panel (B) of Fig. 3).
On the other hand, the as2 topology yields open tilings
for all three system types (dma, dmo and checkers). As
the small cluster analysis shows, while dma-as2 can tile
both p- and np-clusters, dmo-as2 and checkers-as2 can
tile only p-clusters: boxes of dmo-as2 particles yield unsatisfied bonds or overlaps, while the checkers-as2 can not
even form np-bonds (see the clusters in the corresponding
panel of Fig. 2, lower part). As a result, for dmo-as2 and
checkers-as2 the competition between op- and onp-tilings
is completely suppressed and the op-tiling is selected, resulting in hΨdmo−as2 i = hΨcheckers−as2 i = 1.00 over the
whole ∆-range (see panel (B) of Fig. 3).
In contrast, for dma-as2 both open tilings are possible. Nonetheless, an open lattice with mixed bonding is
never observed for ∆ ∈ [0.2, 0.3, 0.7, 0.8] since for these
∆-values the connection of p- and np-clusters induces a
high strain on the tiling, leading to self-healing processes,
e.g., when a p-cluster forms at the surface of the largest
np-cluster during crystallization (see video in the Supplementary Materials). Our results show that the onp-tiling
is preferred with respect to the op-tiling, resulting in an
order parameter hΨdma−as2 i = −1.00 for the aforementioned ∆-values (see panel (B) of Fig. 3). Nonetheless,
the possibility of forming an op-tiling is not completely
suppressed: for ∆ = 0.2, one of eight simulation runs
resulted into a op-tiling, while the rest of the simulations yield a onp-tiling. In contrast, for ∆ ∈ [0.4, 0.6]
p-defects emerge within the onp-tilings, as indicated by
hΨdma−as2 i = −0.76 ± 0.18 (see panel (B) of Fig. 3) and
the size of the error bar associated to it (see Fig. 6 in
Appendix E ). The presence of p-defects in the np-tiling
is also reflected by the finite size of p-domains, where
hσp i  hσnp i (see panel (C) of Fig. 3). Moreover, as
d
soon as hfnp
i < 1, we know that the tiling is composed
of many different domains.
Within the framework of two patch types, some general trends can be identified. First, the tilings arising
from off-center topologies of dma/dmo systems (either
symmetric or asymmetric) are very different from their
respective center topologies, meaning that on increasing
∆ from 0.2 to 0.5, the order parameter grows from -1

(onp/np-tilings) to almost 0 (random tiling) for all systems with the exception of dmo-as2 where it goes from
+1 (op-tiling) to 0; in contrast, all checkers topologies
yield parallel tilings (see panel (B) of Fig. 3). We note
that with respect to the feq-systems the jump of the order parameter at ∆ = 0.5 is much sharper. The second general pattern we found is that symmetric patch
topologies lead to closed-packed lattices, whereas a very
specific asymmetric patch topology (as2) leads to parallel
and non-parallel open lattices with pore sizes dependent
on ∆.
As the order parameter only characterizes the geometry of the tilings, another parameter must be identified
to quantitatively describe their porosity. The pore sizes
of all described open tilings depend solely on ∆ and can
be calculated from the side length of the pores, pl (see
Methods and Fig. 8 in Appendix G). The dependence of
the pore areas on ∆ in the sticky limit is given in panel
(A) of Fig. 3. In the sticky limit the packing fraction of
the onp-tiling is slightly smaller than the packing fraction
of the op-tiling, however, the measured packing fractions
for finite sized patches are the same within error bars (see
Fig. 8 in Appendix G).
Finally, we observe that the nucleation of the open lattices occurs via both particle-by-particle growth and hierarchical crystallization (see video in the Supplementary
Materials), whereas in systems leading to closed-packed
lattices nucleation proceeds solely via single particle attachment [45].

IV.

CONCLUSION

In summary, we have presented a rationalized picture
of how shape and bond anisotropy can be combined to
drive the assembly of rhombic platelets toward target
tilings with specific properties. By choosing the identity
of the interaction sites and their placement on the rhombi
edges, we are able to assemble tilings with identical lattice geometry and tunable porosity from a close-packed
arrangement to a highly porous, open lattice.
Despite the simplicity of the model, our findings can
be applied to the assembly of small tetracarboxylic acids,
such as TPTC and NN4A molecules, on a graphite
substrate. We note that possible mismatches between
the molecular systems and our coarse-grained description might emerge in some cases due to differences either in the steric constraints or in the bonding energies.
In the first case, small overlaps between rhombic units
might not correspond to overlaps between molecules, thus
slightly enlarging the tiling possibilities of the molecules
with respect to our patchy platelets. In the latter case,
exploratory simulations have shown that a change in the
patch-patch interaction energy can affect the balance
between p- and np-bonding and hence the final tiling.
While the comparison between molecular systems and
patchy platelets is already satisfactory, these two possible sources of mismatch set the challenge for a refined

coarse-grained model aimed at a more quantitative investigation of molecular tilings.
In contrast, at the colloidal level, we expect our model
to completely describe the assembly of patchy platelets
with a regular rhombus shape [30]. In the colloidal realm,
patches are physical or chemical areas on the colloid surface and they can be differentiated by means of, e.g.,
surface roughness [46] or DNA strands [47], while the
placement of the patches might result from the use of
colloidal joints [48].
In this zoo of molecular and colloidal building blocks,
our work gives design directions for the production of
materials with tunable porosity and lattice geometry,
paving the way to building new interesting materials.
In particular, the ability to fine tune the lattice porosity might make it possible to create lattices that can
dynamically and reversibly switch between close-packed
and open structures.

Appendix A: Patch topologies
1.

Topologies for feq systems

We introduce the parameters ∆k (with k = 1, 2, 3, and
4) that define the distance of patch k from its – arbitrarily
chosen – reference vertex. If patches can be placed anywhere on the edges, the full set of four parameters {∆k }
is needed to describe one particle type. As we introduce
symmetry operations on the patch arrangement, we can
describe each particle type by one single parameter ∆ and
a patch topology. In general, the investigated topologies
can be split into symmetric topologies (s) and asymmetric topologies (as): if we consider the vertex enclosing a
120◦ angle as reference vertex for the pair of patches belonging to its respective edges, then in s1 and s2 topologies patch pairs are symmetrically arranged with respect
to their shared vertex, while in as1 and as2 topologies

Particles in the snapshots are colored according to their orientation. However, in some cases colors are mismatched because
the particle orientation is calculated with respect to the orientation of the biggest cluster.

pairs of patches are described by {∆, 1 − ∆}. In contrast,
in the sc and asc topologies one pair of opposite patches
is fixed in the center. We consider three symmetric (s)
and three asymmetric (as) patch topologies (see panel
(H) of Fig. 1) and ∆-values spaced by 0.1 from ∆ = 0.2
to 0.8. Note that all six topologies collapse to feq-center
for ∆ = 0.5 and that particle types are symmetric with
respect to ∆ = 0.5.

2.

Topologies for dma/dmo/checkers systems

We consider patchy rhombi with two kinds of patches
for any patch arrangement (given again by a patch topology and a ∆-value. Patches of the same kind attract each
other with − while, patches of a different kind repel each
other with . The three ways to distribute four patches of
two types on four rhombus edges are (see the single particle representation in Fig. 2): positioning patches of the
same kind to enclose the larger rhombus angles (doublemanta, dma), positioning patches of the same kind to
enclose the smaller rhombus angles (double-mouse, dmo)
and positioning patches of the same kind to sit on the
parallel edges (checkers). In all the cases, we define the
patch positions as distances to reference vertices. For
example, the s1-topology of dma and dmo systems describes all systems where patches of the same kind have

the same distance to the vertex enclosed by those patches
(see Fig. 2). As in the case of feq-systems, the investigated topologies can be split into symmetric topologies
(s), where patches of the same type m retain the same
∆ (∆m2 = ∆m1 ) with respect to the reference vertices
and asymmetric topologies (as) where ∆m2 = 1 − ∆m1 .
With these definitions a particle can be characterized,
again, by its patch topology and only one ∆. All topologies collapse to their respective central configuration for
∆ = 0.5.
In both dma and dmo systems with s2 as well as as1
topology, ∆ and (1 − ∆) particles are equivalent through
exchange of patch type, while checkers-sc with ∆ and
(1 − ∆) are equivalent through rotation (see the corresponding panels in the lower row of Fig. 2). Additionally,
even if not denoted in Fig. 2, for dma/dmo/checkers with
as2 topology, particles with ∆ and (1 − ∆) are equivalent through a three-dimensional flipping. In contrast,
for dma-s1, dmo-s1, and checkers-asc systems there is no
equivalence operation that turns a ∆ into (1−∆) particle.

Appendix B: Cluster move algorithm

In a cluster move algorithm with a static linking
scheme [39, 40], a so called pseudocluster is generated by
attempting to link particle i with one of its neighbours j

βf is a fictitious inverse temperature and Θ(nc − NC ) is
a conventional theta function acting as a physically motivated cutoff. A neighbour of a particle i is defined as
a particle that lies within its interaction range. Starting
from a seed s we try to add all neigbhours of an already

when the pseudocluster size nc exceeds NC = rint(η −1 ),
where η is a uniformly distributed random variable between 0 and 1. The fictious reciprocal temperature βf
controls the likelihood of forming pseudo-clusters of a
certain size. Note that if βf = 0 no pseudo-clusters bigger than one will be formed, whereas if βf = β, the
cluster-move acceptance rate is 1. Hence, one can choose
βf freely between 0 and β, and we choose βf = 5. After generating a pseudo-cluster in the described way, we
either translate the particles by the same amount or rotate them around the center of mass of the cluster. The

Fig. 1). Nonetheless, as there are binding restrictions on
particles attaching to already bonded dimers/multimers,
the total number of p- and np-bonds is not equal. To account for this imbalance and to quantify the randomness
correctly, the order parameter
Ψ = (0.608np − 0.392nnp )/(0.608np + 0.392nnp ) (C1)
was introduced [16], where np is the total number of pbonds, nnp is the number of np-bonds, while the numerical factors were estimated from simulations [14]. This
order parameter is constructed such that it varies from
+1 (p) to -1 (np), where Ψ = 0 corresponds to the perfect
random tiling estimated in Ref. [14].

known, the areas of the pores can be calculated in a

Appendix D: Equilibration of grand-canonical
simulations

In Fig. 4, we report the evolution of the packing fraction throughout a simulation run for all feq-systems together with a representative snapshot of the resulting
tiling. We ensure equilibration of all studied systems by
calculating the packing fraction φ over the course of the
simulations. All observables, i.e., the order parameter
hΨi, the sizes of the parallel σp and non-parallel σnp dod
are
mains, and the fraction of non-parallel domains fnp
evaluated after equilibration is reached as averages over
the last five simulation checkpoints of the 16 runs per
state point.
It is interesting to note that in feq-s1 the frizzy domain
boundaries present in the snapshot are due to simultaneous growth of different clusters. In feq-s2 on the other
hand, boundaries and holes stem from the system’s difficulty to nucleate into a commensurable tiling. Although
in feq-as2 and, to some degree, in feq-asc multiple clusters grow at the same time, the resulting tilings tend
to have few domain boundaries. These better connected
tilings result from the self-healing effect. In this context
it is relevant to note that for feq-as2 and feq-asc we deliberately picked the snapshots with the largest parallel
domains, the roughest domain boundaries and (by choosing ∆ = 0.2) the longest equilibration time.

the sticky limit, where ar is the rhombus area, at is the area
of the triangular pore and ah is the area of the hexagonal
pore. Panel (C): unit cell of the open parallel (left) and open

Appendix E: Patch-patch interaction energy impact
on tilings

We carry out simulations with different values of the
patch-patch attraction energy.
In Fig. 5, heatmaps show how hΨi varies depending on
topology (s1, s2, sc, as1, as2, asc), the patch position ∆
and the interaction strenght . At  = −5.2kB T (that
is the interaction strength used throughout the paper),
feq-systems assemble into tilings with different hΨi.
In contrast, at  = −4.2kB T , all feq-systems remained
in a liquid phase over a simulation time of ≈ 5 × 106
MC sweeps: at visual inspection of the simulation runs,
none of the studied systems formed clusters stable over
more than a few MC sweeps and none of the clusters

12
reached sizes bigger than three. For feq-as2, we added a
state point at  = −4.8kB T and it is worth noting that
the value of hΨfeq−as2 i at  = −4.8kB T indicates a more
np-tiling for all off-center ∆ than at  = −5.2kB T .
We note that the sweet spot for the formation of the
onp-tiling is confirmed to occur at ∆ = 0.3, where – in
this case – p-domains are never observed; in contrast at
∆ = 0.2 and 0.4, we observe either op-tilings – seldom –
or – most of the time – onp-tilings (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 5).
In other words, while at higher bonding energy the growing clusters are mostly a mixture of p- and np-domains,
at lower bonding energy p- and np-clusters grow separately and with different probabilities. The interplay
between the patch-patch bonding energy and the energy
gains/prices of different tilings is very complex and is
beyond the scope of the present paper. From our investigations at fixed patch-patch bonding energy, we can conclude that asymmetric patch topologies where patches
are relatively far from each other (i.e., for feq-as2 and
feq-asc), two different kinds of porous tilings – characterized by different pore shapes – emerge and compete,
with a clear preference towards a non-parallel pattern.
In Fig. 6 we show the histogram of Ψ for feqas2−4.8kB T , feq-as2−5.2kB T , feq-asc−5.2kB T and dmaas2−5.2kB T .
For both dma-as2−5.2kB T and feqas2−4.8kB T we observe a switch at ∆ = 0.2: 15/16 runs
assemble to a non-parallel open (onp) lattice, while 1/16
runs shows a parallel open (op) lattice. Moving on to
∆ = 0.3, 16/16 runs tile non-parallel, indicating a sweet
spot for the formation of the non-parallel (np) tiling in
both systems. At ∆ = 0.4, both systems become more
random, where dma-as2−5.2kB T retains a non-parallel
trend, while feq-as2−4.8kB T shows a softened bimodal distribution. In contrast, feq-as2−5.2kB T and feq-asc−5.2kB T
show an unimodal non-parallel trend for all ∆, where the
peaks shift towards a more random Ψ as ∆ increases from
0.2 to 0.4.

component at the same time. For this reason, the bin
height of the histograms (each normalized with respect
to the total number of either p- or np-domains) does
not give information about the relative amount of p- and
np-bonds. It only displays how many more domains of
smaller size than bigger size exist within one alignment.
The domain size calculation also yields the fraction of p(f p ), and respectively, the fraction of np-domains (f np ).
d
In dma-center, σp , σnp and fnp
have values similar to
those of the feq-center, reflecting the randomness of the
tiling formed by dma-center. In contrast, in dmo-center
p-domains are – on average – larger than np-domains,
whose typical size is σnp ≈ 3 ± 2 particles, due to roofd
shingle motives. This is also reflected in the fnp
-value
that is bigger for dmo-center than for dma-center (see
panel (C) of Fig. 3).
We find that for feq-ceneter, dma-center and dmocenter domain size distributions tend to power-law tails,
which is expected for random tilings [14] and explains
the large standard deviation. In dma-as2 at ∆ = 0.4 and
0.6, the variance in domain sizes does not stem from random tiling motives (as for feq-center and dma-center) or
from roof-shingle motives (as for dmo-center) but from
p-defects within the np-tiling. In contrast to a defect-free
np-tiling, we do observe p-domains of finite sizes: these
p-defects can be large enough to split the np-domains in
multiple large but disconnected domains.

Appendix G: Packing fraction of open tilings

In Fig. 7 we report the size histogram of p- and npdomains for tilings with mixed bonding. We calculated
the domain sizes of p- (σp ) and np-bonds (σnp ) by interpreting bonds of the same alignment as a network,
with particles as vertices and bonds as edges. The p/npdomain sizes are then given by counting the connected
components in those networks. Since we count p/np
bonds rather than particles, particles can be part of a parallel connected component and a non-parallel connected

In Fig. 8, we show the packing fraction of the open
tilings as a function of the patch position ∆ and the unit
cells (see panel (A)). The unit cell of the open parallel (op) tiling consists of one rhombus particle and one
rhombic pore, while the unit cell of the open non-parallel
(onp) tiling consists of three rhombus particles, two triangular pores and one hexagonal pore (both unit cells are
depicted in panel (C)). We calculate the packing fraction
in the sticky limit (lines in panel (A)) by identifying the
unit cells of the open systems and calculating how much
space was taken up by particles versus how much space
was taken up by pores (see the formulas in panel (B)).
We measure the packing fraction with finite patch radius
(rp = 0.05 see Methods section) by taking a sample of
gray scale simulation snapshots of the lattices for every
∆, numerically counting the number of non-white pixels (particles) and taking the fraction (see the resulting
points in panel (A)).
