In strictly one-dimensional systems, repulsive interactions tend to reduce particle mobility on a
lattice. Therefore, the Drude weight, controlling the divergence at zero-frequency of optical conductivities in perfect conductors, is lower than in non-interacting cases. We show that this is not the case
when extending to quasi one-dimensional ladder systems. Relying on bosonization, perturbative and
matrix product states (MPS) calculations, we show that nearest-neighbor interactions and magnetic
fluxes provide a bias between back- and forward-scattering processes, leading to linear corrections to
the Drude weight in the interaction strength. As a consequence, Drude weights counter-intuitively
increase (decrease) with repulsive (attractive) interactions. Our findings are relevant for the efficient
tuning of Drude weights in the framework of ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices and equally
affect topological edge states in condensed matter systems.

INTRODUCTION

The seminal work by Walter Kohn [1] established the
Drude weight as a crucial quantity to describe the conduction properties of strongly correlated quantum systems. At zero temperature (T → 0), it weights the zerofrequency divergence of the conductivity [2–5]

signaling a perfect conductor, which, as conventional superconductors, supports non-dissipative/ballistic transport. In quasi one-dimensional conducting rings of size
L, the Drude weight also determines the dissipationless
persistent current J = DΦ/L [6–10] generated in response to a (infinitesimal) magnetic flux Φ threading the
ring. Persistent currents are an equilibrium property of
quantum coherent conductors and are a phase-coherent
manifestation of the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) phase Φ acquired by particles upon looping around the ring, equivalent to a twist in the periodic boundary condition. As
a consequence, Drude weights coincide with the susceptibility of the ground-state energy E to such a twist:

In conducting systems, the Drude weight remains finite in
the thermodynamic limit, while its exponential suppression signals insulating behavior. Beyond its usefulness for
analytical and numerical calculations, Eqs. (1) and (2)
establish a remarkable connection between the transport
properties and the sensitivity to modified boundaries of
quantum-coherent systems, underpinning, for instance,
the scaling theory of Anderson localization [11–15] and
many-body generalizations thereof [16–18].
Recent interest in Drude weights is motivated by its
rich behavior displayed in the presence of interactions
and the general importance for experiments addressing
novel quantum transport phenomena: Surprisingly, the

divergent contribution in Eq. (1) does not always disappear at finite temperature in fine-tuned integrable models [19–21] and Drude weights contribute to the Hall response of quasi one-dimensional (1D) systems [22, 23].
Importantly, synthetic quantum matter systems, such
as ultracold atoms confined in ring-shaped optical
traps [24–32], provide an experimental platform to study
orbital responses to an applied flux in which temperature, particle statistics, and even interactions can be engineered almost at will. Moreover, the currents driven
by either displacing the confining potential [33] or tilting
the system [34] reproduce those generated persistently
by a flux Φ in a ring geometry in an adiabatic approximation [23], therefore accessing Drude weights with open
boundary conditions.
It is thus important, both on the experimental and
fundamental level, to understand and develop physical
intuition concerning the effects of strong correlations on
the Drude weight. It is commonly believed that repulsive
interactions reduce particle mobility in a many-body system, leading to a generic reduction of the Drude weight
[15, 35–37]. Nevertheless, it was recently observed that
this fact is remarkably violated in Creutz ladders [38]:
this was attributed to the presence of an isolated Dirac
cone and put into relation to the anomalous magnetic
orbital response of 2D graphene [39].
In this work, we show that the increase of Drude
weight by local repulsive interactions at zero temperature is actually a more general feature of quasi-1D interacting systems thread by a transverse magnetic flux
χ, see Fig. 1. We show this phenomenon by first relying on perturbative calculations, which are nicely reproduced by matrix product states (MPS) simulations.
We understand this phenomenon by deriving the effective
low-energy Luttinger Liquid theory of interacting quantum ladders, showing that nearest-neighbor interactions
and magnetic fluxes provide a bias between back- and
forward-scattering processes. Finally, we connect this
phenomenon with the Quantum Hall effect [40], in which

2
the presence of magnetic fluxes leads to the suppression
of interaction-induced backscattering. As a consequence,
the prominence of forward-scattering on polarized edge
states leads to increased mobility, signalled by an increased Drude weight.
Remarkably, such Drude weight corrections are linear
in the interaction strength, thus allowing for efficient tunability of this quantity by switching to attractive interactions, in which case the Drude weight is suppressed.
Our findings are important as they shed new light on
the transport properties of strongly correlated systems
with non-trivial topological properties, which may be accessed both in synthetic and solid state quantum matter
systems.
The work is structured as follows: In Section II, we review why repulsive density-density interactions do not
yield strong (i.e. linear in the interaction strength)
renormalization of the Drude weight in strictly onedimensional systems. Section III reviews the singleparticle properties and band structure of the Creutz
model. In Sec. IV, we calculate the leading order corrections to the Drude weight in the interaction strength,
showing quantitative agreement to MPS simulations.
Section V presents the effective Luttinger Liquid interpretation of the Drude weight increase, showing bias
between back- and forward-scattering processes induced
by orbital effects, making connection to Quantum Hall
regimes in two dimensions.

II. WEAK DRUDE WEIGHT
RENORMALIZATION IN 1D

In strictly one dimension, interactions cannot possibly
affect the Drude weight in Galilean invariant systems,
due to the perfect decoupling of the center-of-mass motion (affected then by the flux insertion) from the internal degrees of freedom (affected instead by interactions).
Noticeably, this holds true also for multi-component systems, as long as the only coupling between different
species is of density-density nature: in that case, it will be
the total current (and therefore the total Drude weight)
to be untouched by interactions, while off-diagonal drag
coefficients may depend on the inter-species interaction
strength. The presence of a lattice, once away from commensurate effects which might resonate and open a gap,
is expected to affect this important result only beyond
leading order. These facts are readily understood in the
bosonization formalism [41], which will later help us to
clarify where the hack in the ladder case resides.
Consider a generic
single-band tight-binding HamiltoP
nian, Hkin = k ε(k)nk , in which ε(k) is the band dispersion and nk the density at momentum k. In a lowenergy approximation, the band dispersion ε(k) can be
linearized close to the Fermi points, ε(k) ∼ ε(±kF ) ±
vF (k ∓ kF ), with vF the Fermi velocity. Such linearization allows to define two separate right- and left-moving
fermions (Rj /Lj ) out of the original fermions on lat-

tice site j, cj ∼ eikF j Rj + e−ikF j Lj , and their densities
nα,i = αi† αi (α = R, L). In such “Tomonaga-LuttingerDirac” approximation, the fermionic fields can in turn
be expressed via a pair of canonically conjugate bosonic
fields φ and θ, [φ(x), ∂x0 θ(x0 )] = iπδ(x − x0 ), which describe density and current fluctuations of the effective
low-energy system: ni = nR,i + nL,i = −∂x φ(x)/π and
Ji /vF = nR,i −nL,i = ∂x θ(x)/π, respectively. The Hamiltonian can
exactly cast in the

 bosonized form
R dxbe then
Hkin = 2π
vF (∂x θ(x))2 + (∂x φ(x))2 [41, 42]. In the
presence of (short-range)
P interactions, described by the
Hamiltonian Hint = i,j Vi,j ni nj , the Luttinger Liquid
Hamiltonian is only slightly modified to

(3)
in which the Luttinger parameters u and K correspond
to the velocity of the collective plasma oscillation of
the gas and give information about interactions, respectively: e.g., repulsive 1D fermions are usually described
by K ≤ 1. The additional term V[φ] collects all additional non-quadratic terms generated by density-density
interactions, which – importantly – do not depend on the
bosonic operator θ, be the system on a lattice or not: Indeed, the definition of the current operator obtained via
the continuity equation is unaffected,
[n, Hint ] = 0 =⇒ ∂x J = −∂t n = −i[n, H] = −i[n, Hkin ]
= i[∂x φ, Hkin ]/π = vF ∂x2 θ/π. (4)
As a crucial consequence, the product uK – i.e., the
Drude weight – remains equal to the non-interacting
Fermi velocity vF , unaffected by interactions! Standard
minimal coupling, in which threading a flux Φ in a ring
geometry is equivalent to shift momenta as k → k − Φ/L
(i.e., here ∂x θ(x) → ∂x θ(x) − Φ/L), combined with
Eqs. (2) and (3), leads to
D = uK = D0 = vF .

(5)

In the absence of commensurability effects or other gapformation mechanisms, the corrections V[φ] are usually
irrelevant in the renormalization group sense [41], and
therefore they do not affect the validity of the Hamiltonian (3) but at most lead to a renormalization of the
Luttinger Liquid parameters (u, K) → (u∗ , K ∗ ). The
Drude weight gets renormalized D0 = vF → D∗ = u∗ K ∗
as well, but – crucially for the following discussion – such
renormalization is usually weak (i.e., at most of order V 2
in the perturbative expansion) and the Drude weight is
suppressed D∗ < D0 [15, 35, 36].
Alternatively, as we are going to rederive in the following, the validity of the identity (5) is also understood from the fact that interactions generate coupling
between left- and right-movers – so-called g2 backscattering processes: g2 nR nL – and right/left movers themselves – the so-called g4 forward-scattering processes:

them as follows [41]

and, for the same reasons leading to Eq. (5), in conventional lattice systems one always finds g4 = g2 and thus
no renormalization of the Drude weight occurs to leading
order in the interactions.
The arguments leading to the identity (5), namely the
commutation rule (4), do not generally apply in the presence of orbital effects in quasi-one dimensional systems
and, in this paper, we show a very simple mechanism
leading to a modification of the Drude weight in quantum ladders which is linear in the interaction amplitudes
and, remarkably, is positive in presence of typical intrachain repulsive terms.

g = 0 and generic values of χ, this represents the minimal instance of a quasi-two dimensional system pierced
by magnetic flux, which has been extensively investigated
under various aspects [43–50], but interestingly not the
one addressed here. For χ = π and g 6= 0, the model
is the Creutz ladder [51, 52], at whose fine-tuned point
m = g = t the anomalous behaviour of the Drude weight
was originally pointed out and attributed to the presence
of an isolated Dirac cone [38].

THE MODEL

The reference system and a sketch of the physical processes at work are illustrated in Fig. 1. As an illustration, we consider a two-leg ladder of fermions (labeled as
↑ and ↓ species) where the plaquettes are threaded by a
magnetic flux χ. The generalization to the case with N
legs, relevant for topologically protected Quantum Hall
regimes, is discussed in C, with similar conclusions. For
the kinetic/non-interacting part of the Hamiltonian Hkin ,

simplicity). A finite inter-chain hopping of amplitude m gaps
out only one among the right- or left-movers of each singular
chain (dashed lines), leading to a suppression of backscattering g2,k processes compared to forward scattering g4,k processes caused by Vk . As a consequence, the Drude weight
increases. We also sketch how V⊥ increases back-scattering,
opposite to the action of Vk .

h̃i = hi /h. This can be readily checked by verifying
U † (k)H0 (k)U (k) = h0 (k)1 + h(k)σz . In Fig. 2, different spectra are given for different set of parameters
of the Creutz model, among which the band dispersion sketched in Fig. 1 is reproduced. In the following
chapters, we will exploit heavily the two basic ingredients to obtain the strong renormalization of the Drude
weight: (i) a transverse flux χ which polarizes the dispersion bands along a chosen axis in an asymmetric fashion and (ii) a gapping mechanism such that only one
pair of the chiral modes remains intact. As a consequence, the densities defined in the chosen axis (here,
σz ) are spread asymmetrically in k-space (as depicted
in Figs. 1-2) and same-spin density-density interactions
favor forward-scattering, whereas different-spin densitydensity terms favor backscattering processes.

PERTURBATION THEORY

As a supporting point for the Luttinger Liquid analysis
we develop in Section V, we first derive the corrections
to the Drude weight relying on standard perturbation
theory to leading order in the interaction strengths Vk ,
V⊥ , and U . Equation (2) requires to derive first the corresponding corrections to the ground-state energy. We
focus on the situation of interest, in which only the lowest band ε− is occupied (n+,k = 0 ∀k). To leading order,
the interaction-induced corrections to the Drude weight
are obtained by averaging the interaction terms onto the
ground state. A magnetic flux threading the ring is equivalent to twisting the boundary by a phase Φ and a matter
of substituting k → k − Φ/L, upon which we expand to
second order

The Drude renormalization by interaction, according to
leading order perturbation theory, depends on the precise
form of the microscopic model and does not follow any
universal law. Strikingly, if we restrict to a single pair
of Fermi points, the Drude weight increases for Vk > 0
and decreases for V⊥ > 0 throughout the entire phase
space m, g, t which can be readily checked by evaluating
Eqs. (19),(16) and (18) (see App. A, Fig. 5). As a trivial
consequence, but in contrast to the common intuition,
attractive interactions (Vk < 0) decrease the orbital response function D. In case of absent transverse magnetic
flux χ = 0, there is no renormalization of the Drude
weight. The reason for such absence of strong (linear in
the interactions) renormalization is the absence of any
symmetry breaking mechanism between g4 and g2 processes induced by interactions, which are triggered by a finite χ as exemplified in Fig. 1 based on the Luttinger Liquid analysis we carry out in Section V. Moreover, we also
notice that the remarkable strong absence of renormalization DU = 0 and Dk /Vk + D⊥ /V⊥ = 0 in leading order perturbation theory initially derived in [38] does not
hold in general, but applies only for very special points in
the phase space such as the single Dirac cone setting at
m/t = g/t = χ/π = 1 (more generally, the particle-hole
symmetric Dirac cone setting at m/t = g/t = sin(χ/2)).
Finally, we emphasize the perfect agreement between perturbative results and MPS simulations for a weakly interacting system of size N/L = 20/32 as presented in
Fig. 3.
We also stress the fact that such corrections to the
Drude weight are actually strong and can be comparable to the non-interacting value itself, as clearly shown
by the MPS simulations reported in Fig. 4, in which we
considered values of the interactions comparable with the
parameters of the non-interacting model (7).
The presented predictions from perturbation theory
are qualitatively captured by the effective bosonized lowenergy model which we derive in the next section.

FIG. 3. Renormalization of the Drude weight by interaction
(different colors and symbols). Continuous lines represent the
thermodynamic limit of the perturbative calculation given in
Eqs. (19), (16), (18) and symbols represent results obtained by
MPS simulations. Numerical values are converged up to the
third decimal digit. The system size is N/L = 20/32. Each
set of data is obtained by the interplay of the kinetic term with
individual interactions H = Hkin + Hi with weak interaction
amplitudes Vk = 0.1t, V⊥ = 0.1t, Vk = V⊥ = 0.1t and U =
0.125t. The two figures demonstrate the robustness of the
strong Drude weight renormalization, namely its increase for
Vk > 0 and decrease for V⊥ > 0 around the fine-tuned point
of a single Dirac cone m/t = g/t = χ/π = 1. Hereby, we
devote our focus to the influence of the individual interactions
by subtracting the corresponding non-interacting value D0
from the total susceptibilxity, i.e. Di = D − D0 . In (a) we
display the interaction-induced Drude weight shift Di versus
transverse flux χ, in which the curvature of the two SU(2)
symmetric interactions denoted by red (down-triangle) and
green (right triangle) is not visible in the chosen scaling. To
quantify, the plotted valus of DU /U are all inside the interval
[0, 5] · 10−3 and D⊥ /V⊥ + Dk /Vk resides in [−4.2, 0] · 10−3 .
Panel (b) shows Di as a function of the nearest neighbor interspecies hopping amplitude g/t.

BOSONIZATION AND CONNECTION TO
QUANTUM HALL SYSTEMS

The physical reason behind the linear increase and suppression of the Drude weight by the Vk and V⊥ interaction, in the presence of a finite transverse flux χ, becomes
apparent in the bosonization formalism. The bosonization of the interacting Creutz model requires a linearization of the spectrum close to the Fermi energy.
We consider the case of central charge c = 1 (i.e.,
two Fermi points) with the chemical potential crossing
the lower band ε− (k). Even though we keep the discussion general here, the reader can think of the situations depicted in Fig. 2. Proceeding in analogy to
Refs. [53, 54], we approximate the two species of ↑ / ↓
fermions as a superposition of a single pair of left (L) and
right (R) movers. Thus, the kinetic part of the Hamiltonian takes the form (3) with vF = ∂k ε− (k)|k=kF . To
bosonize the interactions, we switch to the continuum
and apply the aforementioned transformation onto the
spin-density operators to be inserted in Hint . We consider situations out of quarter-filling, in which Umklapp

terms ∝ e4ixkF R† R† LL stop oscillating and may cause
relevant gap-leading perturbations [53]. The total density operator thus becomes
ni ∼ nR (x) + nL (x)
−2u(kF )v(−kF )[e−2ikF x R† (x)L(x) + h.c]. (20)
This density representation differs from that of a truly
1D spinless Luttinger Liquid by the presence of the coherence factors u and v. At this stage it is possible to
understand the reason why the relation (5), valid for
strictly 1D systems, does not hold in our context: the
projection via Eq.(15) on the low-energy sector captured
by this bosonization approach is not a Bogoliubov transformation, as it does not preserve the fermionic anticommutation relations of the operators c↑/↓ . Moreover,
it is responsible for the modification of the commutator with the interacting Hamiltonian which becomes nonzero, [n(x), Hint ] 6= 0. As we have already seen in Sec. II,
such a condition is necessary not to modify the current
operator and derive Eq. (5). Here, we explicitly lack
this condition and expect a strong renormalization of the
product uK for the effective Hamiltonian.

(23)

As a consequence, in the presence of repulsive intra-chain
nearest-neighbor interactions, bosonization predicts the
increase of the Drude weight by repulsive interactions.
Given the remarkable fact that such correction is linear in the interaction constant Vk , attractive interactions
reduce the mobility of such systems (D < D0 ). Notice
also that this results holds irrespective of the topological
nature of the bands in the Creutz model (m ≶ g). The
particular interest in the bosonization approach is that it
allows to readily identify the breaking of symmetry between the relevant forward- and back-scattering processes
(g4 and g2 respectively) responsible for such mobility increase in the presence of intra-chain interactions. Notice
further that, also within bosonization, no renormalization of the Drude weight occurs in the absence of transverse magnetic flux χ = 0. As sketched in Figure 1, the
possibility to induce, via magnetic fluxes, orbital effects
in such ladder system, allows to suppress interactioninduced backscattering between left-and right-movers as
these modes are separated in space (spin-polarized).
Such a phenomenon can be put in connection to the
exponential suppression of backscattering by topological
bulk protection in Quantum Hall systems [40]. As we
discuss in detail by extending to the multi-leg case in
App. C, following the spirit of the coupled-wire construction of topological insulators [55, 56]. As modes in the
bulk are gapped, local interactions cannot efficiently couple any degree of freedom to the chiral modes which are
localized at the sample edge, thus backscattering is exponentially suppressed with the number of legs. Nevertheless a residual effect of interactions remains, which is forward scattering, that, as made explicit by the bosonization formula (6), increases the Drude weight. In Quantum Hall systems, which feature ballistic edges states
at their border, the Drude weight is also expected to
be renormalized by interactions [57, 58]. Nevertheless,
such corrections were never calculated explicitly in lattice
models, especcially not the increase induced by repulsive
interactions discussed in this work. Our work predicts

7
that, surprisingly, such renormalization is actually strong
(linear) in the interaction strength and generally leads to
an increase of the Drude weight for short-range repulsive
interactions, in striking contrast to what expected in the
one-dimensional limit.
Additionally, we notice that, in the bosonization formalism, introducing inter-chain interactions V⊥ has exactly the opposite effect on the Drude weight, namely its
suppression. In the Quantum Hall picture discussed in
the previous paragraph, the H⊥ interaction can be seen
as a long-range interaction coupling left- and right-chiral
edges. As a consequence, backscattering is induced and
thus the Drude weight is reduced. This kind of longrange interaction is unlikely to affect condensed matter
system. Nevertheless they (in particular HU ) are actually the ones mainly at work in synthetic systems involving artificial gauge fields [33, 34], whose are responsible of
non-trivial effects [59] which deserve further investigation
in the presence of orbital effects.
We conclude this section mentioning that the bosonization results are quantitatively different from the perturbation calculations reported in Sec. IV, on which we can
fully rely given their perfect comparison with MPS calculations. Nevertheless the qualitative picture remains the
same, apart from the perfect cancellation of the contributions resulting from Hk + H⊥ . Such quantitative discrepancies are expected in bosonization given the strong approximation regarding the linearization of the dispersion
and the presence of an underlying lattice in the microscopic model. In App. B, these quantitative discrepancies
are discussed in detail.
Moreover, we mention that the renormalization of the
Drude weight of the SU (2) symmetric interaction HU remains intriguing. In Figs. 3-4, DU shows an interesting
change of sign as a function of g. Even though, also in
this case, our perturbative calculations nicely reproduce
the MPS simulations, we could not provide an intuitive
explanation of this feature relying on bosonization. The
main difficulty here is also related to the lost of information about the fact that operators are originally at
the same point after switching to the diagonal basis for
Eq. (7). We leave the investigation of this issue for future
work.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

As mentioned in the Introduction, there is a strong
experimental and fundamental interest in the coherent
transport properties of correlated systems confined to
ring geometries [24–32]. Knowledge about the behavior of the Drude weight in this context is crucial, as
this quantity controls the magnitude of persistent currents in such systems. Our results shed new light on
the transport properties of strongly correlated quantum
systems, demonstrating how repulsive/attractive interactions counter-intuitively increase/decrease the mobility
of interacting fermions in the presence of orbital effects.

We derived the effective continuum Luttinger lowenergy theory of the interacting Creutz model and focused on the situation with only two Fermi points, that
is central charge c = 1. We have shown that the Drude
weight changes linearly in the coupling parameters Vk , V⊥
of the two orbital-selective nearest-neighbor interactions.
Our study generalizes and clarifies the possibility of tuning the Drude weight observed in a previous study using MPS and second order perturbation theory [38], predicting a linear dependence of the Drude weight with
respect to Vk , V⊥ and U . In this work, we limited
the bosonization approach to the simplest situation with
only two Fermi points, but a generalization to higher
central charges is straightforward. A direct comparison
with leading order perturbation theory and MPS simulations reveals quantitative shortcomings of the standard
bosonization procedure regarding the prediction of transport properties. Future work in this direction should
definitively address these issues.
Interesting perspectives concern the geometrical interpretation of the effects discussed in this work [60] and the
study of the interplay of quantum impurities and bulk interactions in such systems [31, 61]. Moreover, it is completely open for investigation how the interactions studied in this paper affect a setup in which energy and mass
transport are induced by biased reservoirs [62–67]. In this
case, interactions are not expected to affect the mass conductance [68], but only the thermal conductance, leading
to the violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law [66]. In this
setting, transport is controlled by conductances, rather
than Drude weights and transverse magnetic fields in the
connecting region are expected to lead novel quantized
effects [69, 70]. Another direction of interest would be to
study the renormalization of the transverse flux χ susceptibility, in order to stabilize end enhance pretopological
fractional excitations [48–50, 71].

Here we present the detailed derivation of the bosonized Hamiltonian in Eq. (3) of the Creutz model. We begin by
projecting the spinors onto left- and right-moving fermions of the bottom band.

in which we neglect some infinite, but constant, terms. We notice this expression only involves the density field φ.
Thus, it does not affect the current operator and has no effect on the Drude weight, even though it affects g4 and g2 .
Finally, we remind that the mover-densities relate to the bosonic fields according to
nR (x) = [∂x θ(x) − ∂x φ(x)]/2π ,

nL (x) = −[∂x θ(x) + ∂x φ(x)]/2π .

Appendix C: Crossover to two-dimensional systems

We generalize the model defined in Ch. III to the case of N legs of the quasi one-dimensional wire. In momentum
space, we choose the transverse flux χ such that the generalized Hamiltonian takes the simple form

H0N (k) =
(m − g cos k) (c†jy ,k cjy +1,k + h.c.) − t cos (k − χ(2jy − (N + 1))) njy ,k .

†
This Hamiltonian may be diagonalized by a rotation onto the bands UN (k) such that UN (k)H0N (k)UN
(k) = EN (k),
with a diagonal matrix EN (k) = diag(ε1 (k), ε2 (k), . . . , εN (k)) containing the ordered bands εi (k) ≤ εi+1 (k) (see Fig. 6).
Although more general scenarios may be considered, we focus here on the coupled wire formalism which is obtained
by setting g = 0. In particular, this adresses the one-dimensional limit of the Harper-Hofstadter model [72, 73],
understood as a coupled-wire system [55] and studied recently also in the context of superconductivity [74]. We
require a central charge c = 1 such that one has a single pair of left and right moving species defined on the lowest
band ε1 (±kF ). This justifies the approximation similar to Eq. B1,

where the local leg density is defined as njx ,jy = c†jx ,jy cjx ,jy . Due to the nature of the applied projection, other

The remaining calculation to arrive at the Luttinger Liquid Hamiltonian is similar to the one presented in main text,
and, for Vk (1) = Vk (N ) identical g-factors are recovered (substituting u → u1 , v → uN , Vk → Vk (1) and V⊥ → V⊥ (N )).
As a consequence, the result here is analog to the one presented in the main text
g4,k − g2,k = 2(u21 − u2N )2 > 0 .

(C5)

In Fig. 6 we explicitly target the 2D limit N → ∞, showing that u1 is the leading contribution – thus strongly
suppressing g2,k processes in the effective model. It has to be stressed that Eq. C2 is not a unitary transformation
and projects onto the relevant low-energy sector of the model. In the case of N > 2, the bulk is fully projected out in
the effective model and only effects on the edges of the system can be recovered. This makes it impossible to deduce
bulk properties like the Hall conductivity σH that is instead universally quantized at a given filling. Instead, what
we claim here is a strong modification of the edge Drude weight due to interactions for which a universal scaling
law dependent on the interactions has been reported using chiral Luttinger liquid approaches [57]. Building up on
this statement, we provide here a generic example that enhancement effects of the Drude weight become universally
applicable for systems hosting polarized conduction bands dressed with repulsive density-density interactions.
Appendix D: Comparison between leading order perturbation theory and bosonization

Major deviations between perturbation theory and bosonization arise from Eq. B1 which requires a flat rotation
matrix U . In particular, according to first order perturbation theory, the canonical operators can be expressed using
the bottom band modes only, i.e.

The momentum transfer in forward-scattering processes g4 is small compared to the Fermi momentum and the above
equation is automatically satisfied. However, back-scattering processes g2 always transfer momentum comparable
to kF and the above equation requires the rotation matrix being almost constant in q, i.e. U (n) /U (q) ≈ 0. We
show a few example contours of the first three derivatives of f (n) /f (kF ) along g and χ in Fig. D which indeed
explains major deviations at regions in which u(n) /u and v (n) /v are large. On the contrary, at the single Dirac cone

point g = χ/π = 1 the rotation matrix has entries u/v(k) = cos / sin(k/4), as a consequence the n’th derivatives
are exponentially suppressed in n and Eq. D2 becomes a reasonable approximation. Clearly, in regions outside of
Eq. D2, g2 processes are not correctly considered in the effective model and thus strong deviations in D⊥ are expected.
Remarkably, the qualitative results of the effective model stay valid at the full region of c = 1, i.e. we find a positive
shift of the Drude weight induced by Hk , and, a negative effect of comparable amplitude due to H⊥ . In conclusion, the
above equation fully disregards band- and coherence factor curvature, yielding a consistent result with leading order
0,0
perturbation theory up to zeroth order in the coherence factor derivatives only (Hz,1
= 2h̃z (kF ) terms in the Drude
weights are recovered). For a future investigation, it might be interesting to relax Eq. D2, in particular including
higher order terms in q. This not only accounts for a sum of right and left movers on different lattice sites in Eq. B1,
it naturally reintroduces non-trivial curvature of the coherence factors u(k) and v(k), ultimately giving subleading
corrections to γi in Eq. B4.

Appendix E: Details on the MPS simulations

The matrix product states (MPS) results presented in the main text were performed by our own implementation
of a U(1) symmetric code preserving the total number of particles, based on the anthology of tensor networks build
on a symmetry-preserving library in collaboration with the group of S. Montangero at the University of Ulm [75].
Periodic boundary conditions (PBC) in general are hard to tackle using tensor network schemes due to the absence
of a canocial form, which is a necessity to simplify the computational complexity in variational optimizations [76].
A naive solution used heavily in exact diagonalization is the introduction of long-range terms mimicking periodic
boundary conditions by coupling the edges of the system. However, such a strategy is deemed to fail for MPS Ansätze
because, by construction, long-range correlations are not captured sufficiently. An alternative scheme is obtained by
deforming the ring into a 1D open boundary system with short-range next-to-nearest neighbor couplings, depicted
in Fig. E, panel (a). This deformation amends the strong asymmetry between short-range hoppings and long-range
boundary terms by reshuffling the lattice sites. The two depicted ring geometries are numerically equivalent and yield
an efficient simulation of periodic boundary conditions with open boundary MPS algorithms at the cost of slightly
increasing the matrix product operator (MPO) dimension.
The extraction of the particle mobility D is straightforward – we simulated the ground state energy dependence
E (Φ) on the magnetic flux Φ penetrating the ring. Numerically, coupling to a magnetic flux is readily done by
applying the local transformations t → teiΦ/L and g → geiΦ/L in the real-space kinetic Hamiltonian Hkin . The
susceptibility function can then be extracted by two equivalent procedures: i) by approximating the second derivative
2
according to ∂Φ
E(Φ) = (E(Φ + ) + E(Φ − ) − 2E(Φ)) /2 + O(4 ), sending  → 0 and then Φ → Φm , or by ii)
fitting the energy dependence. Hereby, Φm is the energy extremum which depends on the parity of the underlying
system. In most cases, Φm = 0/π for an odd/even number of fermions respectively [77]. According to leading order
perturbation theory, it is possible to extract the mobility D by a quadratic fit function f to approximate the energy
dependence E(Φ) according to f (Φ) = a + b(Φ − Φm )2 with Φm being the energy extremum, and the Drude weight
being D = 2πLb, which is correct up to O((Φ − Φm )4 ) in the flux Φ. Due to an astonishing agreement between
