ABSTRACT: We developed a model of paraffin wax crystal coarsening that well describes our
experimental results and allows behavior of the paraffin films to be predicted on the basis of the
extracted kinetic parameters. Wax crystalline films were evaporated on different substrates
(silicon wafer, glass slide, thin layer of gold on silicon), thermally treated at different
temperatures (4−60 ºC), and investigated by powder X-ray diffraction, high-resolution scanning
electron microscopy, and optical confocal imaging of the surfaces. Preferred (110) crystal
orientation of all deposited wax films, independently of substrate type, was observed from the
start and increased during heat treatment. The change in preferred orientation was accompanied
by changes in crystal morphology and shape, resulting in surface nano-roughening. We modeled
the process as the coarsening of oriented C36H74 crystal islands driven by the decrease in total

1

surface energy. Coarsening kinetics was controlled by diffusion of single molecular chains along
the substrate. Evolution of nano-roughness during annealing time was well described by a
surface coarsening law, Hr

~

t1/4. Two additional factors influenced the evolution rate: strains

accumulated in wax crystals during deposition, and divergence of initial crystal shape from the
shape at equilibrium. Both factors lowered activation energy and effectively shortened
coarsening time.

INTRODUCTION
The n-alkanes are simple organic molecules, whose presence in various ordered molecular
assemblies such as Langmuir-Blodgett films1 and self-assembled monolayers2 makes them useful
in case studies of the orientation, assembly and morphology of complex organic films. In
addition, n-alkanes have attracted research interest as materials for technological applications, as
they can serve as lubricants, protective layers and surface modifiers controlling surface
wettability and chemical properties. A tetratetracontane (C44H90) passivation layer, for example,
was recently shown to increase charge carrier mobility in a field-effect transistor by an order of
magnitude.3,4
Thin polyethylene films with improved mechanical properties were prepared as early as 1970.5
Vapor deposition has since been shown to be a useful method for the formation of organic thin
films with desirable molecular orientation, achievable through the control of deposition rate,
substrate temperature, substrate surface energy and morphology.6-8 Relatively high deposition
rates and low substrate temperatures are commonly employed for thermal evaporation. These
conditions lead to kinetically controlled growth, a non-equilibrium process that often terminates
in structures considerably distorted from the bulk structures.9

Generally speaking, the formation of a thermally evaporated thin film can be divided into three
steps: evaporation (from source material), adsorption to the substrate, and nucleation on the
substrate. Adsorbed molecules can move along the substrate with alternating molecular
orientations, in addition to undergoing re-desorption and diffusion processes that will determine
the final molecular orientation and structure of the thin film (Figure 7a).7 These processes have
been extensively studied in thin films deposited via ultra-high vacuum growth by organic
molecular beam deposition,9 where many of the processes also occur in thermally evaporated
films (moderate vacuum growth). In both cases, the growth of organic thin films is often a
kinetic process that results in non-equilibrium structures leading to post-growth reorganization.10 Theoretical studies have been restricted mainly to the description and prediction
of growth modes and film morphology, particularly the scaling theory.11,12 Nevertheless, both
theoretical and experimental research are focused on growth stages and the resulting orientation
and morphology.6,13-17 In a recent study, Pechook et al. observed post- evaporation growth, from
the nano to the micro scale at room temperature, of hexatriacontane (C36H74) wax crystals for
wetting applications.18 Up to now this phenomenon has not been further addressed. Here we
present a thorough study of wax crystal growth and propose a theoretical model describing the
suggested growth/coarsening.

EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
1. Sample preparation
We prepared samples by thermal deposition of hexatriacontane wax, C36H74 (98%, SigmaAldrich (France)) on Si substrates, using a Bio-Rad Polaron Division Coating System.
Deposition was carried out in a vacuum chamber at 10-5 mbar. Samples were positioned on a

3

holder 10‒12 cm above a crucible loaded with 10 mg of hexatriacontane wax. Evaporation
occurred at ~120 ºC upon application of pulses of an electrical current. Deposition was
conducted at ~20Å/s. The system was rapidly heated to ~120˚C by manual adjustment of the
power. The evaporated specimens were transferred to 25 ºC (room temperature, RT). Thermal
treatment procedures were conducted at 25 ºC, 32 ºC, 40 ºC, 50 ºC and 60 ºC for durations of 1,
5,10, and 50 h (MRC-1410DIG oven, in air).
2. Characterization
Wax powder and crystalline thin films were characterized structurally and micro-structurally by X-ray
diffraction with a Cu-anode sealed tube (Rigaku, SmartLab X-Ray Diffractometer). Surface imaging was
performed by HRSEM (Zeiss Ultra Plus). Micrographs were obtained at different times after deposition
of the RT and heated samples. Roughness was assessed by confocal microscopy (Leica DCM 3D).

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
Samples were prepared at a deposition rate of 20Å/s. Using high-resolution scanning electron
microscopy (HRSEM) and optical confocal imaging of the surfaces, we investigated the
morphology of wax crystalline films immediately after their deposition and after different
thermal treatments (Figure 1). Examination of as-deposited films by X-ray diffraction (XRD)
revealed the tensile stress accumulated in the layer after evaporation (Figure 2). The diffraction
peak of the film is seen to have shifted to a higher diffraction angle, which corresponds to
smaller d-spacing in the diffraction direction and larger d-spacing in the lateral direction
(Poisson’s ratio). Strains from the shift in the diffraction peak positions were determined as
follows:


dm  d0

where dm and d0 are the measured and the unstrained d-spacing respectively. Initial strains  
1% decreased to zero during annealing (at 25 ºC for 50 h, or at 40 ºC for 10 h). A rapid
roughening process was observed during annealing at temperatures above room temperature
(25−50 ºC). Wax crystal shape changed during annealing, tending to become longer and
narrower than the initial shape.

of thermally evaporated C36H74 on Si substrates.
Comparison of Figure 1a with Figure 1c, showing heat treatment-induced evolution of crystal
shape, led us to view the growth mechanism at this stage in terms of crystal particle growth
occurring at the expense of smaller particles via a coarsening process.
To better understand this process in the case of the wax crystals, we developed a theoretical
model. Based on this model, we further analyzed our experimental results to determine the
kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the system.

THEORETICAL MODEL
The C36H74 clusters that form islands on the deposited wax film are responsible for the
measured initial nano-roughness, and their growth and coarsening correspond to evolution of

6

wax film nano-roughness during thermal treatment. We consider the wax layer immediately
below the islands as a substrate and a source of C36H74 molecules for growth of the islands, which
then are considered as crystal wax particles. Let’s assume that a wax crystal particle is a bar with
sizes W, H and L,

where W ~ H, L >> W and the size ratios H / W     s /  2  and

H / L  p   s /  1  , where  s    s 0   s  / 2 , s is the bar/substrate surface energy, s0 is the
energy of the external surface parallel to the substrate, 1 and 2 are corresponding interface
energies of the bar, and  and p are the numerical coefficients (Figure 3). The values  = p = 1
correspond to the equilibrium shape of the bar, where the minimum surface energy determined
by Wulff construction for the bar's volume V0  HWL .

Figure 3. Schematic diagram of the crystal wax bar at the substrate. The relative sizes are
assumed to be constant: H / W     s /  2  , H / L  p   s /  1 
As previously discussed, thermal evaporation of thin films at room temperature introduces
strain into the films. The free-energy formation of the bar can be expressed as:

G   Gv     WHL  2(WH ) 1  2( HL) 2  WL( s   s 0 )

(2)

where Gv is the volumetric free-energy formation of C36H74, and   is the deformation
energy per unit volume of the strained bar.

Nv1  WHL  R3 ( 1 2 /  s2 ) . The average chemical potential of a single molecular chain inside

(Figure 4). The flux J bar is the number of molecules of the volume v1 that pass through the unit
interface of the bar in 1 s. The flux is determined by diffusion of single molecular chains along
the surface of the substrate and absorption of these chains by the wax bar at the bar's interface.
The latter process may be related to overcoming a substantial barrier known as the EhrlichSchwöebel barrier (ESB). In a steady-state process, the diffusion flux along the substrate's
surface, J D , should be equal to the flux through the ESB, J ESB (Figure 4):

In the general case, the average aspect ratios of the bars, and consequently the values of  and
p, vary during annealing, being a function of time and temperature. Finding these dependencies
may allow exact integration of equation (19). For large dimensionless times    PPK B t / w03  1
and constant  and p, the equation returns to quaternary dependence (20) (see SI part A).
For  ≤ 1, however, dependence can differ substantially from 1 (Figure S1).

12

The value of  PPK can be estimated from the experimental data on roughness evolution during
annealing at different temperatures, and thus the diffusion coefficient and activation energy of
the process can be found.

÷APPLICATION OF THE MODEL TO EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
We measured the root mean square (RMS) nano-roughness, Hr, of the thermally deposited nhexatriacontane wax films during different annealing temperatures.18 The results can be now
analyzed in accordance with the coarsening kinetics (equations 13 and 19), taking into account
that the nano-roughness corresponds to the average height of the islands above the continuous
wax film, which grow during coarsening and transform to the observed platelet-like wax crystals,
H   p 

1/ 3

R.

The evolution of RMS nano-roughness during annealing at different temperatures is shown in
Figure 5. The slope of the functions H r ( t ) in double logarithmic coordinates (Figure 5a) closes
to s = 1/4 after a certain transition period that decreases with temperature. The functions H r4 ( t )
are well approximated (Figure 5b) (much better than the functions H r3 ( t ) ) by the linear
dependencies, which are indicative of the interface coarsening regime over the long enough
annealing duration. The characteristic time for transition from a cubic-like growth to the
quaternary-like coarsening can be estimated as t  w03 /  PPK B : when annealing time t  t , the
above-introduced dimensionless time   1 . Based on evaluated parameters (see below) we can
find t for different annealing temperatures (see Table 2). At room temperature (25 ºC) t  4
min, and is smaller for higher temperatures.

13

As demonstrated below (see SI part B), the transition behavior of the slope is related to the
change in the wax crystal aspect ratios during the initial period of annealing.

An additional factor possibly influencing the coarsening kinetics is the change in effective
surface energy of the non-equilibrium wax crystals,    s (1    p) /  p  , since the aspect
1/3

ratios of the wax crystals vary during annealing, tending towards equilibrium, when  = p = 1.
By using the experimental time dependencies of aspect ratios H / W and H / L , we were able to
find the values of   s /  2   4.36 and   s /  1   0.62 . The measured normalized aspect ratios as

DISCUSSION
The evolution of wax film roughness during annealing follows quaternary-like dependence of
the mean average size on time, corresponding to interface diffusion-controlled coarsening. The
driving force of this process is the decrease in total surface energy. The activation energy of the
coarsening process of strained wax crystals can be expressed as follows:
st
Eact
 Edif  hs    1

(21)

The first term in eq. (21) is the diffusional barrier, the second is the sublimation enthalpy of nalkanes from the wax crystal to the substrate surface, and the third is the strain energy per one
molecular chain in the strained bar. Weber et al.19 investigated the growth dynamics of n-alkanes
on silica at 35 °C. While they did not find the absolute value of the diffusional barrier, they
showed that the increase in the barrier per additional carbon atom is  0.5 meV. This corresponds
to the diffusion barrier Edif  0.2 eV for n-alkane C36H74 chains.

16

The Ehrlich-Schwöebel barrier, evaluated for step-edge crossing of several organic molecules
such as para-sexiphenyl molecules20 and others19 is WES=(0.08−0.8) eV. The empirical data of
Mandelkern et al. for ED 21 can be summarized by the expression

ED 

5kBTm2
Tm  Tg

(22)

where Tg is the glass transition temperature. Using the corresponding values for n-alkane
C36H74, Tg = 164K22 and Tm = 347K, we obtain ED = 0.28eV. Therefore, the diffusional barrier
and the Ehrlich-Schwöebel barrier are of the same order. In such a case, we can conclude that

Ds  Db l , i.e.  << 1, and that the mass transport is controlled by diffusion along the surface
of the substrate.
The second term in equation (21) is the sublimation enthalpy of n-alkanes from the wax crystal
to the substrate surface. According to Bennema et al.,23 sublimation enthalpy of the long-chain
normal alkanes to vacuum for n = 36 is about hsv  35 kcal/mole =146 J/mole = 1.52 eV. To the
best of our knowledge, sublimation of chain alkanes from wax crystals to a substrate has not
been described. Taking into account possible binding energy of the molecule’s chains to the
surface, we can assume that hs  hsv ,  < 1. Using the experimental values of Eact  1.0 eV
for activation energy and Edif  (0.2−0.3) eV for diffusional barrier, we can estimate  = 0.5−0.6.

entropy of fusion and Tm is the melting temperature of the wax. Using the value h f = 116
kJ/mole for n-alkanes with n = 36,24 we can estimate Cwe for different values of  (Table 1).

Using the estimated values of Cwe (Table 2) we can evaluate the diffusion coefficient of singlechain molecules along the substrate surface as (2−8.5)10−14 m2/s at 25−60 ºC.
As mentioned above, two additional factors influencing the kinetics of coarsening are the
strains introduced into the wax crystals during thermal deposition at room temperature and an
initial non-equilibrium shape of the wax crystals. The deformation introduced during deposition
was found to be about   1%.18 These strains may be caused by the substantially different
thermal expansion coefficients of paraffin wax and that of the substrate materials (for paraffin it
is about 10-4 K-1 while for Si it is 4.510-6 K-1). Let us now estimate possible values of
deformation energy  1   for such deformations. Interatomic potentials in the n-hexatriacontane
crystals are expressed by the Buckingham potential:23

(r ) 

(24)

where r is the interatomic distance. Strain of the bar, , can be considered as a change of
interatomic distance to a small value r   r , which results in change of the interatomic bonds:

and r 

 b2  / 4 , a = 4.97Å, b = 7.478Å, yields   0.5 kcalmol−1. Each atom has 4

strong bonds in the lateral directions, and the overall bond energy of the molecular chain is a
linear function of its length, n. The strain energy caused by deformation  can be evaluated as

  v1  4n   2n kcal/mol

(26)

For n = 36 and  = 0.01, we find   v1 = 0.72 kcal/mol = 0.031 eV. This corresponds to a
decrease in effective activation energy of the coarsening process to a value  0.031 eV. The
factor B for

T = (298K−323K) where B  exp   v / k BT    3.3  2.9  , means that the rate of

coarsening can be 3 times faster in strained than in unstrained n-hexatriacontane crystals.
During annealing the decreases in strain might result in a corresponding slight increase in
activation energy.
The second substantial factor influencing the coarsening kinetics of thermally deposited films
is an increased effective surface energy of the non-equilibrium wax crystals. During very slow
deposition the shape of wax crystals is dictated by minimization of the surface energy, while fast
deposition does not allow such minimization. After fast deposition the wax crystals are usually
shorter and wider than wax crystals at equilibrium. During annealing the crystal shape evolves
towards the shape at equilibrium. This process is controlled by diffusion of singular chain-like
C36H74 molecules along the surfaces of the wax bars, while at the same time this evolution
competes with the change in shape due to the arrival of new molecules from the substrate
surface. The result is a non-monotonic change of aspect ratios during annealing (Figure 7).

20

For wax crystals that are initially wider ( < 1) and shorter (p > 1) than those at equilibrium,
the rate of evolution during thermal annealing can be significantly faster than in equilibrium
shaped crystals, since the effective surface energy    s (1    p) /  p 

1/3

becomes

substantially higher than the equilibrium value0.07 = and 6p = 1. . For example, for  eq  3 s
(typical dimension ratios for initial wax crystal shape after fast deposition) the effective surface
energy   5.54 s . The value w0 ~  and the shape function f ( p,  ) (in equations (14), (19))
become temperature- and time-dependent during the annealing process since the aspect ratios
tend to be equilibrium values (, p  1). This may affect the initial kinetics of the bar’s growth,
especially at lower annealing temperatures (25−32 ºC). The variation in slope during the
transition period of annealing may be related to the change in aspect ratios of the wax crystals
during this period (Figure S3, SI part B).
The kinetics of shape equilibration of the wax is dictated by its surface mass flows, which are
driven by the difference in mean chemical potentials at the top and back facets of the bar:

1  211 / L, 2  21 2 / w and

s  21 s / h , defined in terms of weighted mean

curvature.25 The total mass arrival rate for a facet is the sum of the mass flow rates at the facet
edges. These flow rates are dictated by the chemical potential gradients at the facet edges. When
facets undergo uniform normal displacements that preserve their shape and orientation, the
gradient or divergence of the flux must be constant on each facet, resulting in parabolic variation
of the chemical potential along the facets.25,26 The exact solution of this problem is beyond the
scope of the present investigation. At the same time, our experimental investigation of the
changes in wax crystal shape during annealing at different temperatures allowed us to ascertain

21

and approximate the time and temperature dependencies of the ratios p and , and use them to
evaluate the wax coarsening process.

CONCLUSIONS
Hexatriacontane (C36H74) wax crystal films that are thermally deposited on a silicon substrate
undergo a roughening process during annealing above room temperatures. Coarsening of the
C36H74 crystal islands responsible for the measured nano-roughness of the wax films, is driven
by the decrease in total surface energy. The coarsening kinetics are controlled by diffusion of
single molecular chains along the substrate that provides a linear time dependence of the forth
degree of the nano-roughness, H r4 ( t ) ~ t . Two additional factors influence the evolution rate:
strains accumulated in the wax crystals during deposition and the initial shape of the crystals
(divergence from the shape at equilibrium). Both factors lower activation energy and effectively
shorten the coarsening time. Variations in the aspect ratios of the wax crystals lead to a decrease
in the slope of the dependence H r4 ( t ) during the transition period of annealing. Our model of
paraffin wax crystal coarsening provides a good description of the experimental results and
makes it possible to predict the behavior of paraffin films based on the extracted kinetic
parameters of the system.

Paraffin Wax Crystal Coarsening: Effects of Strains and Wax
Crystal Shape
Sasha Pechook, Alex Katsman, and Boaz Pokroy

Synopsis: A model of paraffin wax crystal coarsening effectively describing experimental results
and allowing the prediction of paraffin films behavior on the basis of the extracted kinetic
parameters was developed. Evolution rate was influenced by strains accumulated in wax crystals
during deposition and divergence of initial crystal shape from equilibrium shape. Both factors
lowered activation energy and effectively shortened coarsening time.
