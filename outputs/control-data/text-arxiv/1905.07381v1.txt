We analyze the symmetry and topological features of a family of materials closely related to pentagraphene, derived from it by adsorption or substitution of different atoms. Our description is based
on a novel approach, called topological quantum chemistry, that allows to characterize the topology
of the electronic bands, based on the mapping between real and reciprocal space. In particular,
by adsorption of alkaline (Li or Na) atoms we obtain a nodal line metal at room temperature,
with a continuum of Dirac points around the perimeter of the Brillouin zone. This behavior is
also observed in some substitutional derivatives of penta-graphene, such as penta-PC2 . Breaking
of time-reversal symmetry can be achieved by the use of magnetic atoms; we study penta-MnC2 ,
which also presents spin-orbit coupling and reveals a topological insulator phase. We find that for
this family of materials, symmetry is the source of protection for metallic and nontrivial topological
phases that can be associated to the presence of fractional band filling, spin-orbit coupling and
time-reversal symmetry breaking.

INTRODUCTION

Topological phases of materials due to spatial and non
spatial symmetries are the subject of enormous attention,
both from the fundamental and the applied viewpoint.
Firstly, this is because of the promising features related
to the presence of robust states at boundaries, such as
protected surface states, and also due to the appearance
of novel quantum phenomena, showing unique signatures
in the electronic transport, optical response and other
experimentally relevant magnitudes for applications [1–
4].
The search for materials with such desirable properties
requires the concurrence of symmetry reasoning along
with ab initio calculations. On one side, symmetry constrains in a clear and unambiguously way what kind of
physical magnitudes are good quantum numbers to classify the states in the system, both in direct and momentum space. On the other side, first-principles approaches
allow for the quantitative characterization of the electronic structure of the material. Combining these two
basic ingredients, we can tailor properties of materials by
design, in order to engineer topological nontrivial phases
[5–7].

One of the most general and promising theoretical
frameworks available for the study of novel materials is
the so-called topological quantum chemistry (TQC) [8–
10]. This theory combines the non-local description of
reciprocal space, in terms of bands, with the local, real
space characterization employing atomic orbitals. It allows to classify the universal properties of all possible
band structures of weakly correlated materials, making
possible the identification of the topological nature of
their bands.
In this work, we apply this novel approach to a family of two-dimensional (2D) materials related to pentagraphene (PG). This theoretically predicted carbon allotrope consists of a pentagonal, two-dimensional buckled lattice structure composed only of carbon atoms, first
proposed by Tang et al. [11] and later by Zhang et al.
[12].
Lately, PG has received considerable attention from
different perspectives; it is a quasi-direct gap semiconductor that can be optimally combined with graphene
and other 2D materials. Its potential applications have
been lately explored [13–19], as well as the possibility
of functionalization, adsorption and atomic substitution
with the aim of modifying its properties [20–26].
Some of these modifications may change the semiconducting character of PG, resulting in the appearance of
metallic behavior. This feature has been presented in
previous works [23, 26]; but most importantly, a general

2
symmetry and topological study of these materials is still
lacking.
In what follows, we present a complete TQC analysis and ab initio calculations that explore the topological nature of these materials. We study their different
phases upon inclusion of spin-orbit interaction and breaking of time-reversal symmetry. We find an evolution of
the electronic band structure from a general nodal line
located at the boundary of Brillouin zone (BZ), through
a point-like Dirac node near Fermi level at the corner
of the BZ, to topologically nontrivial phases in presence
of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) plus time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking. These different phases are realized
separately for specific penta-materials by means of firstprinciples calculations.
This work is organized as follows. We first perform an
analysis for the space group of symmetry transformations
present in this family of materials. Next, a topological
study is developed using the TQC approach. Certain
characteristics of the materials, independent of their specific details, are derived from symmetry and topological analysis. Subsequently, we corroborate our study by
means of density-functional theory calculations for several proposed penta-materials, in order to illustrate the
realization of the predicted phases. Finally, global conclusions pertaining this family of materials are drawn.

group (SSG), composed by the set of symmetry operations that leaves the WP invariant. The SSG is a subgroup of the complete space group of the material [9].
Assuming that there are nW orbitals at each WP, one has
to identify the real-space irreducible representation with
which these orbitals transform under the corresponding
site-symmetry group. This gives a complete characterization of the states in real space. Next, the connection
to reciprocal space is achieved via a Frobenius procedure
[9], which induces the so-called band representation [27],
thus giving the relationship between real and momentum
description. If the WP under consideration is a maximal
WP [8], it has a maximal site symmetry group associated.
In this case the induced representation in reciprocal space
is called an elementary band representation (EBR). The
EBRs are the building blocks to describe all the groups of
bands for a particular space group [9]. In order to identify the topological character of the bands, it is necessary
to analyze their global connectivity in reciprocal space.
By means of graph theory, all the possible connections
among high-symmetry points compatible with the crystal symmetry constraints can be obtained [10, 28]. This
allows to classify the EBRs as connected or disconnected.
Disconnected EBRs, which can be decomposed, present
topological nontrivial behavior. The information about
EBRs and compatibility relations for all space groups is
available at the Bilbao Crystallographic server [29].

THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

We briefly summarize here the main concepts employed
in the TQC approach in order to develop a topological
classification of the electronic bands in penta-materials.
First, a direct space characterization of the states is
needed. This is done in terms of real space locations
given by Wyckoff positions (WPs) and atomic or Wannier orbitals. Each WP has associated a site-symmetry

SYMMETRY ANALYSIS

Following the guidelines of the TQC approach, the
fundamental starting point for the analysis of pentamaterials is the knowledge of their symmetry group. The
only formal requisite we impose to this class of materials
is that their space group remains unaltered. Specifically,
the space group of the penta-material lattice (see figure 1) is given by the P 4̄21 mm or no. 113 group [30].
Importantly, it is a nonsymmorphic group; it includes
a glide plane with a fractional translation vector given
by t = (a/2, a/2, 0), where a is the lattice constant of
the material. The nonsymmorphic character has direct
consequences on the energy bandstructure in momentum
space, as we will see below.
The topological nontrivial character of a material is
directly related to the behavior of high-symmetry points
(HSP) and high-symmetry lines (HSL). If a reciprocal
wavevector k is a HSP or belongs to a HSL, there are
certain operations of the space symmetry group G (modulo a reciprocal wavevector) that leaves it invariant. This
set of operations form the so-called little group of k, Gk ,
which is a subgroup of G [30]. The two-dimensional BZ
belonging to the space group no. 113 is presented in Fig.
2. The most relevant set of k points in this group for the
subsequent analysis are Γ, X, M , and the Y -line.
Let us begin with Γ. All the transformations of the
space group leave this point invariant, so its little group
is isomorphic to the space group of the system. With re-

spect to X, the symmetry transformations that leave the
point invariant are I, 2001 ,(2100 | 12 21 0). Therefore, there
are three equivalence classes for GX , and in principle
P 2 the
same number of irreps. However, using the
hl = n
constraint [31], where hl is the dimension of the l-th irrep
and n = 4 is the order of the group, we obtain that only
a two-dimensional irrep can exist. This irrep is labeled
as X1 . For the M point, the invariant operations are

I, 2001 , 4001 ,4001 ,(2100 | 12 12 0),(2010 | 12 21 0),(m110 | 12 12 0) and
(m110 | 12 21 0). Thus M is invariant under the complete
space group G, so GM ∼
= G. However, as k 6= 0, we
have a phase of eikM ·t that is P
present in the wavefunction at momentum space. As
h2l = 8 it follows that
h1 = h2 = h3 = h4 = 1 and h5 = 2. The character table for this little group is given in Table I, that includes
some complex characters due to the nonsymmorphic nature of the group. Finally, the symmetry transformations
for the Y line are I and (2010 | 12 12 0). Since we have two
classes with only one element each, there are two irreps.
The corresponding character table is shown in Table II,
which also contains some complex characters.
The former data for the little groups allows for the description of the degeneracies at these HSPs and HSLs.
An important remark is pertinent in this place. Namely,
if the system possesses time reversal symmetry, we have
to resort to use only conjugate pairs of complex-valued irreps, known as physically irreducible representations [8].
With this in mind we analyze all points listed above.
The Γ point has one- and two-dimensional real representations, thus no TRS constraint is necessary. At X
there is only one irrep with dimension two; therefore,
this point always has a two-fold degeneracy for a spinless
system. The M point has four complex-valued representations and one real-valued representation. TRS forces
us to combine these four irreps in two pairs of conjugate
physical irreps. This process yields the pairs M1 + M4 ,
M2 + M3 and the real M5 . All three physical irreps are
two-dimensional. Thus, as long as TRS holds and the
space group is nonsymmorphic, the energy bands at this
point will be two-fold degenerate. Finally, imposing TRS
at the Y line we are left with only one possible physical

irrep, Y1 + Y2 , which is also two-dimensional. Therefore, every point located at Y has a two-fold degeneracy.
It is worth to notice that the Y line, along with the X
and M points, comprise all the inequivalent points at the
BZ boundary. As there is a two-fold degeneracy in each
case, it occurs a two-fold band touching over the entire
BZ perimeter. This phenomenon is known as a nodal-line
degeneracy [32].
If the spin degree of freedom is taken into account, the
first trivial consequence is the doubling of the spinless
original degeneracy. In this case, the trivial addition of
spin yields a four-fold degeneracy along the nodal line.
A more interesting scenario arises when SOC is included.
Symmetry considerations must be extended to include
double groups [31]. Consequently, the analysis for the
little groups should be performed again, and the bands
should be relabeled according to the new spinorial irreps.
Let us proceed with the analysis. The little group of
the Γ point, GΓ , is enlarged to embrace two new spinorial
irreps labeled by Γ6 and Γ7 ; see Appendix B for the character tables of all the double groups used in this work,
and Table B.1 for this particular group. These two irreps
are two-dimensional, which implies that the maximal degeneracy at this point is two. As commented above, the
X point is described by a unique two-dimensional irrep
without spin; the inclusion of SOC enlarges the character table.
P 2 This can be easily seen using the basic relation
hl = 6, where the solution is given by h1 = 2
and h2 = h3 = h4 = h5 = 1. Thus, four new onedimensional complex representations are added with respect to the spinless case. The character table for this
group is presented in Table B.2. If TRS holds, these irreps are joined in conjugate pairs, giving two possible
physical irreps, namely, X 2 + X 4 and X 3 + X 5 , both
two-dimensional. This last result implies that degeneracy is lifted, as in the Γ point, splitting the group of
four bands into two pairs of bands. The double group
for the Y line has two more irreps, Y 3 and Y 4 , presented
in the character Table B.3. These two irreps are complex and one-dimensional. Like in the previous cases,
TRS implies the pairing of both irreps in the physical
irrep Y 3 + Y 4 , forming a two-dimensional irrep. Therefore, as in Γ and X, the possible four-fold degeneracy
is lifted, yielding two stick-together, two-fold degenerate
bands, along the whole line. finally for the M point,
the double group includes now two new spinorial irreps
M 6 and M 7 , both two-dimensional. The character table
for GM is presented in Tables B.4 and B.5. Again, we
have complex-valued irreps. Under TRS these two irreps
have to be paired in a single physical irrep, denoted as
M 6 + M 7 . This irrep is four-dimensional; being the only
option for the spinful case, we conclude that the M point
is unaffected by the inclusion of SOC, maintaining the
four-fold degeneracy for the energy bands. In summary,
we have shown, based only on symmetry grounds, that
the boundary nodal line disappears under SOC, leaving
only a point-like degeneracy at M .
We finish the exploration of symmetries in penta-

4
materials by relaxing time-reversal invariance. If TRS is
broken, single complex irreps can be physical representations without the need of coupling them in conjugate
pairs. This has straightforward implications in the degeneracy landscape of the energy bands, with or without
SOC. If TRS is absent and no SOC in considered, the
following consequences can be deduced: (i) The Γ point
is still four-fold degenerated; (ii) The X point becomes
non-degenerate; (iii) The M point changes its degeneracy
from four-fold to two-fold; and finally, (iv) at the Y line
we find non-degenerate bands, implying the disappearance of the nodal line for this case.
Additionally, in the SOC plus TRS breaking case we
can deduce the following: (i) at Γ nothing happens, since
all irreps are already real; however, (ii) the conjugate
pairs formed at X under TRS break apart in the single
complex one-dimensional irreps X 2 , X 4 , X 3 , X 5 . Therefore, all bands are non-degenerate at this point. The M
point, which had a protected four-fold degeneracy, due
to time-reversal and nonsymmorphic symmetries, ends
up with a pair of two-fold degenerated bands. Finally,
the degeneracy of the Y line is lifted, leaving four nondegenerate bands for each group of the eight bands occurring in the spinful model.

TOPOLOGICAL ANALYSIS

In order to apply the topological analysis based on the
symmetry description given in the previous section, we
need to establish a model for the relevant energy range,
namely, the vicinity of the Fermi level. All the pentamaterials presented here have the pentagonal lattice of
PG as a basic structure (Fig. 1), which has six atoms
in its unit cell, four of them with coordination 3 and the
other two with coordination 4. In terms of Wyckoff positions (WPs), the atoms with coordination 3 are located
at a non maximal 4e WP, and those with coordination
4 are allocated at a maximal 2a WP. Figure 2 presents
a graphical description of WPs for this particular space
group.

TABLE IV: Band representation for 4e WP with TRS
and no SOC.
With the WPs of the atoms identified, the real space
description is completed enumerating the orbital components for each atomic site. The most important contribution for the considered penta-materials comes from the
pz orbitals, and in particular from atoms at the 4e WP.
We present a minimal model for the topological analysis
based on the four pz orbitals at the 4e WP. Extensions to
this model, including additional atoms, either adsorbed
or as substitutions, can be also important and may involve other combinations of atomic orbitals. However, in
terms of the essential topological behavior the main results are not modified, so we rely on this minimal model
and discuss the necessary additions when appropriate.
Once the real space model is complete, it has to be
translated to momentum space, with the aim to compute its induced band representation and the subsequent
topological characteristics. To calculate the corresponding band representation, the site-symmetry group (SSG)
related to the 4e WP [9] should be identified. This group
is composed of two operations, I, and 2001 . Its character
table is given in Table III (we are only considering the
first two columns and rows in this table for the singlevalued SSG). In a first stage we ignore spin-orbit coupling and assume that TRS holds, which implies the use
of physical irreducible representations [8]. The pz orbitals
transform as the A0 irrep of this SSG. This information
allows to define an induced band representation which
gives as a result the symmetry (irrep labels) of the four
bands throughout the entire BZ, as shown in Table IV.
Here we only show explicitly the TR-symmetric points
Γ, X and M .
A straightforward observation is that this band representation is composite [8]. This is to be expected, since
our model is based on pz orbitals located at non-maximal
WP. Nevertheless, we can express this band representation as a sum of EBRs coming from maximal WP:
A0 ↑ G = (2a) ↑ G⊕(2c) ↑ G (see [29] for the complete list

5
of EBRs for the group). The most important conclusion
for this model is that all sets of bands are two-connected,
and therefore all bands are topologically trivial. Particular examples of this phase show some variations of the
electronic character of the material, depending on the
specific band filling. The inclusion of SOC can lead to
the appearance of additional phases in these materials.
This implies the use of a double group (double SSG) description, as mentioned before. The character table for
the corresponding double group is given in Table III. Due
to TRS, we have to apply the conjugate pair procedure
and join the E 1 and E 2 irreps in a single E 1 +E 2 physical
irrep for the spinful orbitals. This two-dimensional irrep
induces a band representation in reciprocal space shown
in Table V.

TABLE V: Band representation for 4e WP, with SOC

The above band representation takes into account eight
bands arising from the spin degree of freedom. Additionally, by exploring the character of all the EBRs with TRS
for this double group, it can be verified that all sets of
bands are connected, with a maximum of 4-connected
bands (see [29]). Thus, all bands are trivial in this case.
Still, we have some SOC-induced transitions at the HSP
and HSL that modify the degeneracy order as mentioned
in the symmetry analysis, this has consequences on the
electronic properties of particular penta-materials (see
next Section).
Finally, we consider TRS breaking such that complexvalued irreps are allowed. With the same induction procedure employed above, we found the band representation shown in Table VI.

among the high symmetry points and lines through the

representation correspond to all possible solutions of the
compatibility relations between HSP and HSL over the

BZ of the space group of penta-materials, finding the
connectivity solutions presented in Table VII below.

TABLE VI: Band representation for 4e WP with SOC
and no TR.
This is a composite band representation formed by two
groups of four bands. We study only one group, since the
other one has exactly the same structure.
As it is well-known, degeneracy is lowered by TRS
breaking and, this is reflected in the band representation
which becomes decomposable, a signal for the presence
of a topological set of bands [8–10]. If an EBR is decomposable, then different connectivity paths can appear

These sets of bands have to be compared with the
EBRs that the space group induces in momentum space.
As a general rule, if a band representation can be expressed as the combination of some EBRs, then the set
of bands is trivial [9]. Comparing the results for the
band representations above with all possible ERBs, it
can be seen that some sets cannot be expressed in terms
of EBRs; in conclusion, such bands are topological. The
labeling presented in the Table VII depicts this situation.
There are four different possible connectivities that depend on the particular characteristics and band filling of
the material. We can build a toy model to grasp the
general behavior of these phases by fixing the energy
ordering of bands (irreps) to some particular sequence
at HSP and HSL. The possible outcomes are depicted
graphically in Fig. 3. There are three phases presenting

6
nodal degeneracy and one phase with gapped character.
The knowledge of the specific band filling is necessary in
order to classify this topological behavior as metallic or
insulating. This is strongly material-dependent, making
it necessary to analyze specific cases. In particular, for
penta-materials studied in this work, there is an interplay
of metallic phases with or without nodes, along with electron or hole pockets near the Fermi energy, an scenario
that has been found before [33]. In summary, if TRS is
preserved and no SOC is included, penta-materials possess a general band structure with trivial bands in all its
energy range, displaying a perimeter nodal line. The inclusion of SOC while maintaining TRS yields also trivial
bands, but some degeneracies are lifted in the BZ, changing the character of the electronic properties. Breaking
TRS with SOC produces a decomposable band representation that gives rise to four different topological phases,
according to the distinct possibilities for the band connectivity.
This exhausts our study of the electronic band structure for penta-materials within a general group theory
framework. Naturally, other perturbations could be included in order to modify the symmetry character of the
underlying lattice with the possible induction of more
topological phases.
In the following section we apply this general grouptheoretical description to some specific penta-materials.
This is done with the aid of first-principles calculations
and effective models.

V.

The first instance of this family of materials is pentagraphene. It has an all-carbon lattice structure and an
insulating character. Two conduction bands and two valence bands are the main contributors to the low-energy
range [12]. Applying the TQC analysis it can be concluded that, since carbon has a weak SOC and TRS
holds, PG is a trivial (band) insulator. In this context,
PG presents little interest due to its sizeable optical gap.
However, as mentioned before, we can explore additional
configurations by functionalization, adsorption or atom
substitution of penta-graphene without altering its original symmetry. This can be reinforced by an electron
filling analysis as presented in [34]. For the PG space
group (No. 113) the band insulator filling is dictated by
a 4n relation, where n is a positive integer. For PG this
yields a band filling of 36, which results in a band insulator state. If we substitute some carbon atoms we deviate from the 4n-band filling, accomplishing a condition
for the filling-enforced formation of a nodal (semi)metal.
This has to be additionally cross-checked with a chemical
stability study of the material [35].
We present first-principles calculations for several
penta-materials based on PG, with an emphasis in both,
global and local features of their energy bands. We explain the modifications performed in PG to achieve the
specific penta-material and the particular phase realizations with respect to our previous symmetry and topological analysis.
Our calculations were carried out in the density functional theory (DFT) framework using SIESTA [36] and
Quantum ESPRESSO [37, 38] ab initio packages. The
energy cutoff for the basis set was 80 Ry for Quantum
ESPRESSO and for SIESTA calculations we employed localized atomic orbitals as a basis set (double-ζ, single polarized). In both codes were employed norm-conserving
pseudopotentials and the structures were relaxed until the forces on the atoms were less than 0.04 eV/Å.
Exchange-correlation was considered within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), as proposed by
Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof [39]. The convergence of
the total energy is ensured with a Monkhorst-Pack kgrid of 15 × 15 × 1 in both cases. All the geometrical
parameters for the penta-materials presented below are
summarized in Appendix A (see Table A.1). In materials without spin-orbit coupling calculations were carried
with SIESTA and Quantum ESPRESSO giving similar
results. Calculations with spin-orbit coupling were performed exclusively with Quantum ESPRESSO.

case has been previously explored for various elements,
showing metallization of PG [23, 24]. An example of a
relaxed lattice structure with adsorbed Li is presented in
Figure 4. Also, electronic band structure calculations are
shown for this case of Li-adsorbed PG (Li-PG) as well as
Na-adsorbed PG (Na-PG) in Fig. 5. Another possibility
is to explore substitutional derivatives of PG, respecting
the original symmetry. Particularly interesting for this
work is the 2a WP, which corresponds to coordination-4
atoms, forming a penta-XC2 configuration [22, 25, 26],
where X={B, N, P, Si, G}. The lattice structure of these
materials is exactly the same as PG, with modifications
in the relative bond magnitudes and lattice constant. We
show the band structures for X=B, N, P in Fig. 6.

FIG. 6. Band structures of different XC2 penta-materials.

Since these theoretical materials preserve the PG space
group P 4̄21 mm, they show a similar trend in the electronic band structure. However, now there is a fractional filling of the conduction (valence) band, which

can be described in this trivial phase (no SOC + TRS)
by a single EBR. As stated by Bradlyn et al. [8], if
the Fermi level sits on a single EBR with fractional filling, the corresponding material is necessarily a protected
(semi)metal. Thus, all these metal-PG and penta-XC2
materials are symmetry-protected metals. We have some
remarks about this result. The above-mentioned symmetry protection is of crystalline character; since the
space group is nonsymmorphic and TRS symmetry is
preserved, it implies the well-known ”stick-together” phenomenon for energy bands [31] along the Y line. This
effect can be seen in the band structures of all pentamaterials in this regime. It is remarkable that the sticky
bands occur along all the BZ boundary. This implies that
there is a trivial crystalline nodal line for these pentamaterials. The nodal line presents a certain dispersion,
i.e., it is not at constant energy in momentum space. This
effect is mainly induced by the lack of inversion symmetry
which moves the nodal states to different energies, a fact
that has been demonstrated in general in previous works
[32, 33]. For PG-adsorbed or substituted materials, although the nodal line is energy-dependent, it crosses the
Fermi energy, producing a single nodal point plus pockets of electrons or holes. This can be clearly seen in the
band structures shown in Figs. 5 and 6. Looking closer
to the local low-energy behavior of the nodal line at the
vicinity of the Y line, we observe that bands have a linear
dependence on kx along constant ky lines, so these carriers behave as massless fermions. This can be observed in
a momentum space cut presented in Fig. 7. The massless
fermion low-energy dispersion becomes more relevant if
the Fermi level actually sits on a state of the nodal line.
This crucially depends on the band filling fraction, being realizable in some of the materials studied. Notice
that, although we have a trivial phase in these materials,
we still can have protected edge states. This can be explained in terms of the ten-fold way classification of the
Fermi surface [40]. As the considered materials belong
to the AIII (chiral unitary) class, for spatial dimension

d = 2 a trivial phase arises, as expected. But due to
an inherited non-triviality from another related AI (orthogonal) class, robust edge states that present linear or
dispersionless characteristics might appear [41]. Next,
SOC effects are explored by means of first-principles calculations. To this end, we use as an example penta-PC2 .
Its band structure is presented in Fig. 8. As we are dealing with light elements the effect of SOC is rather weak;
therefore, all these materials will behave as nodal line
semimetals at room temperature, showing a continuum
of Dirac nodes along the Brillouin zone boundary. Furthermore, these Dirac points are accessible under variations of the Fermi level position, making these massless
fermions available under different perturbations, such as
doping or electrostatic gating.
Notwithstanding, the results derived by the symmetry
analysis are confirmed. Namely, degeneracies at Γ and
X points and along the Y line are lifted. Likewise, the
robustness of the M point four-fold degeneracy is confirmed by these calculations, which allows us to identify
this as a novel metallic phase similar to that studied by
Topp et al. [42]. The symmetry that protects the ”sticktogether” effect along the Y line is broken, and the degeneracy of the above-mentioned high-symmetry points
is also modified, implying the disappearance of the nodal
line. Therefore, for these penta-materials, SOC plus TRS
enforces a transition from a nodal line metal state to a
spin-orbit Dirac-node metal with nodal points located at
M [43, 44], both phases being topologically trivial.

Topological phase: Breaking TRS

In what follows we show an example of a pentamaterial for the TRS-breaking phase with SOC: PG with
substitution of Mn atoms at the 4e WP (or penta-MnC2 ).
In this case, magnetic Mn atoms break TRS and induce
an intrinsic spin-orbit interaction, which results in a nontrivial phase. The corresponding band structure calcula-

tions are presented in Fig. 9. In this example the fourfold to two-fold change of degeneracy at the M point due
to TRS breaking can be corroborated. We observe that
along this high-symmetry path no band crossing among
the four-band subgroups occurs. Further, the Y line is
completely nondegenerate, as expected. Thus, we have a
situation similar to the ”a” phase presented in the model
introduced in Sec. IV. We also find that the structure
is magnetic and choose a ferromagnetic configuration,
which is more energetically favorable. We ignore further
magnetic group information for the subsequent analysis
and restrict only to double space group data.
In the case of non-trivial phases it is also necessary to
establish a topological classification based on the calculation of topological invariants. In this case, we will use
a numerical technique known as Wannier Charge Center
(WCC) evolution [45, 46]. In order to implement this
procedure, an effective model defined in terms of Wannier functions must be supplied. We construct this model
for the low-energy regime of penta-MnC2 using the code
Wannier90 [47, 48]. This code uses a DFT band structure calculation as the input and wannierize the system
by projecting the eigenfunction space to an initial set of
orbitals. We chose sp3 orbitals for C atoms plus s and
d orbitals for Mn atoms. This is an extension of the basic model with p orbitals only, however, no d orbitals in
this case transforms in a similiar form hat p orbital for
the SSG of the 4e WP. We set a tolerance of 10−10 for
the wannierization (minimization) procedure and define
a frozen energy window of 3 eV around the Fermi level
taking into account 20 bands.
With this model at hand, its band structure can be
computed for penta-MnC2 ; it is shown in Fig.10. It
agrees very well with that obtained from first-principles
methods, being a good starting model for the topological
invariant calculations.
The WCC evolution is related to several topological
invariants such as the Z2 invariant and Chern numbers.

FIG. 11. Top: WCC evolution for x axis. Bottom: Sum of
WCC for the x axis.

In the particular case we are studying, since TRS is broken [5] we just compute Chern numbers. This is done by
taking the sum of the WCCs at each k point and then
counting the times this function winds across the vertical
axis while along the entire k-path [45]. This procedure
has the advantage that only bulk properties are needed to
compute the topological invariants of a material, without
resorting to more expensive surface or edge state calculations. To this purpose, we have used two codes: Z2pack
[49] and WannierTools [50]. Only the Z2pack results are
presented here, since WannierTools gives a similar out-

come. Z2pack uses the Hamiltonian in terms of Wannier
functions as an input. Additionally, we set a position
tolerance of 0.001, a gap tolerance equal to 0.1 eV and
a number of lines of 200. The WCC calculation can be
carried for each one of the spatial directions of the system. For penta-materials, being 2D systems, there are
two directions, x and y. We present the WCC evolution
and WCC sum for both directions in Figs. 11 and 12,
respectively.
It can be observed that the respective Chern numbers
are non-zero for both directions. In particular, a Chern
number of Cx = 1 was obtained for the x-direction and
Cy = −1 for the y-direction, related to the winding of the
sum of the WCC across the respective k directions. This
implies a charge pumping effect along each k-space direction [49, 51] and hints for a nontrivial topological phase
at the bulk gap. If we additionally define a global Chern
number as the sum of Cx and Cy , we obtain zero. This
indicates that a direction-dependent protection of robust
states is present in the system, which can be related to
a crystalline symmetry protection [45]. This symmetry
can be tracked to an axis-dependent operation, which
in this case corresponds to a nonsymmorphic π-rotation
about either the x or y axis plus a fractional translation
[30]. Thus we conclude that penta-MnC2 is a material
realization for a magnetic topological insulator phase.
In summary, we have studied a set of materials sharing
a space group structure that we named penta-materials.
A detailed analysis for many physical possibilities, including TRS and TRS breaking as well as SOC, shows
that these materials can host different phases. We have
found nodal line fermions if SOC is weak and TRS is
present; in metallic penta-materials; this implies that
a continuum of Dirac points are accessible around the
Fermi energy. Also, symmetry-protected Dirac points
arise if SOC is strong enough. Finally, if TRS is broken
and SOC is sufficiently high, we encounter a nontrivial

10
topological phase characterized by non-zero Chern numbers for both primitive directions in k-space. A wider
class of penta-materials, from other substitutions or functionalization, awaits for the full characterization of their
topological phases and the obtention of additional physical properties.
