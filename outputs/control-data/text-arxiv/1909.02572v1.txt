ABSTRACT
Optically-compact star-forming galaxies (SFGs) have been proposed as immediate progenitors of
quiescent galaxies, although their origin and nature are debated. Were they formed in slow secular
processes or in rapid merger-driven starbursts? Addressing this question would provide fundamental
insight into how quenching occurs. We explore the location of the general population of galaxies with
respect to fundamental star-forming and structural relations, identify compact SFGs based on their
stellar core densities, and study three diagnostics of the burstiness of star formation: 1) Star formation
efficiency, 2) interstellar medium (ISM), and 3) radio emission. The overall distribution of galaxies in
the fundamental relations points towards a smooth transition towards quiescence while galaxies grow
their stellar cores, although some galaxies suddenly increase their specific star-formation rate when
they become compact. From their star formation efficiencies compact and extended SFGs appear
similar. In relation to the ISM diagnostic, by studying the CO excitation, the density of the neutral
gas, and the strength of the ultraviolet radiation field, compact SFGs resemble galaxies located in the
upper envelope of the SFGs main sequence, although yet based on a small sample size. Regarding
the radio emission diagnostic we find that galaxies become increasingly compact as the starburst ages,
implying that at least some compact SFGs are old starbursts. We suggest that compact SFGs could
be starburts winding down and eventually crossing the main sequence towards quiescence.

In the past decade, various studies have revealed a
tight correlation between the star-formation rate (SFR)

and the stellar mass of star-forming galaxies (SFGs).
The so-called main sequence (MS) of star formation
(e.g., Brinchmann et al. 2004; Daddi et al. 2007; Elbaz et al. 2007; Noeske et al. 2007; Whitaker et al.
2012) exhibits a small scatter observed at least up to
z ∼ 4 (∼ 0.3 dex; e.g., Elbaz et al. 2007; Noeske et al.

et al. 2015) implying that secular evolution is the dominant mode of stellar growth where gas inflows, outflows,
and consumption through star formation are in equilibrium (e.g., Daddi et al. 2010a; Genzel et al. 2010; Tacconi et al. 2010; Dekel et al. 2013; Feldmann & Mayer
2015). Therefore, SFGs spend most of their time evolving as extended star-forming disks. Conversely, quiescent galaxies (QGs), having low specific star formation
rate (sSFR), are located below the MS and are typically
more compact than SFGs for a fixed stellar mass and
redshift (e.g., van der Wel et al. 2014). The quenching
of star formation and the departure from the MS must
imply the build-up of a central stellar core (e.g., Kauffmann et al. 2003; Lang et al. 2014; van Dokkum et al.
2014; Whitaker et al. 2017; Barro et al. 2017a).
A population of galaxies have been proposed to be the
missing link between the extended SFGs and the more
compact QGs, the so-called compact star-forming galaxies (cSFGs; e.g., Barro et al. 2013, 2014; Nelson et al.
2014; Williams et al. 2014; van Dokkum et al. 2015). cSFGs are typically located within the scatter of the MS,
although their origin and nature are still debated. Given
the implications of the small scatter of the MS, several
studies advocated that extended SFGs within the MS
are capable of building up their stellar cores slowly in
their secular evolution (e.g., Dekel et al. 2013; Zolotov
et al. 2015; Tacchella et al. 2016). However, starburst
galaxies (SBs) dominated by a violent episode of star formation typical of gas-rich mergers that move well above
the scatter of the MS are also capable of quickly building
up compact stellar cores and have been also proposed as
early progenitors of QGs (e.g., Cimatti et al. 2008; Ricciardelli et al. 2010; Fu et al. 2013; Ivison et al. 2013;
Toft et al. 2014, 2017; Gómez-Guijarro et al. 2018).
Did the build-up of the stellar core, formation of cSFGs, and subsequent quenching of star formation happen as the product of the slow secular evolution or
rapidly? Or in other words, is it the natural endpoint of
secular galaxy evolution when a sufficiently large bulge
has build up or does it require an external event like
a merger-induced starburst to compress the gas at the
center of the collision and quickly convert it into stars?
Some works have recently pointed towards the starburst nature of cSFGs based on their interstellar
medium (ISM) properties (e.g., Spilker et al. 2016; Barro
et al. 2017b; Popping et al. 2017; Tadaki et al. 2017;
Talia et al. 2018). However, these results are still based
on a handful of cSFGs. Other recent works have also
indicated the existence of a population of SBs within
the scatter of the MS based on their high SFR surface
densities based on far-infrared (FIR) and radio observations (Elbaz et al. 2018; Jiménez-Andrade et al. 2019),

and also, a population of galaxies within the scatter of
the MS undergoing compact star formation based on
CO lines observations (Puglisi et al. 2019).
In this work we explore the location of extended and
compact SFGs and QGs with respect to the MS and
structural relations and investigate three diagnostics of
the burstiness of star formation: 1) Star formation efficiency (SFE), 2) ISM (CO excitation, density of the
neutral gas, and strength of the ultraviolet field), and
3) radio emission (FIR/radio ratio and radio spectral
slope). We aim at shedding some light on how rapidly
the build-up of compact stellar cores and subsequent
quenching of star formation takes place.
The layout of the paper is as follows. We describe the
sample selection and identification of extended, compact
SFGs, and QGs in Section 2. In Section 3 we explore
the distribution of SFGs and QGs with respect to fundamental star-forming and structural relations, followed
by a discussion in Section 5. We investigate SFE, ISM,
and radio emission diagnostics of the burstiness of star
formation in Section 4. We summarize the main findings
and conclusions in Section 6.
Throughout this work we adopted a concordance cosmology [ΩΛ , ΩM , h] = [0.7, 0.3, 0.7] and Chabrier initial
mass function (IMF) (Chabrier 2003).
2. SELECTION OF COMPACT STAR-FORMING

GALAXIES
2.1. Optical Sample
There are several cSFGs selection criteria in the literature. We followed the Barro et al. (2017a) identification
criteria based on structural and star-forming relations.
Barro et al. (2017a, see also references therein) showed
that SFGs and QGs follow distinct trends in the stellar density versus stellar mass plane, with QGs being
offset to higher densities at fixed stellar mass and redshift. cSFGs are galaxies that follow the structural relation of QGs, while being star-forming. Therefore, cSFGs are more compact than regular SFG at fixed stellar mass and redshift. Barro et al. (2017a) proposed
a compactness selection threshold in the core density
(Σ1 , r < 1 kpc) as the most efficient way of selecting
cSFGs, given the small scatter of the Σ1 − M∗ QGs
structural relation and mild normalization decline with
redshift. This threshold is:
Σ1 − 0.65(log M∗ − 10.5) > log B(z) − 0.2,

(1)

where log B(z) have a small redshift dependence ranging between 9.5–9.8 M∗ kpc−2 (see Barro et al. 2017a,
for details on its definition). For simplicity, we will refer
to this threshold as Σ1QGs hereafter. In contrast, the

cSFGs as Old Starbursts Becoming Quiescent
QGs structural relation based on the effective density
(Σe , r < re , where re is the effective radius) would be
less efficient identifying cSFGs as it shows larger scatter and variation of the normalization with redshift. By
extension, other selection criteria based on stellar mass
and effective radius would be also less efficient. Since
by construction both cSFGs and QGs follow the same
structural relation, the distinction between cSFGs and
QGs is based on the distance to the main sequence of
star formation (∆MS), defined as the ratio of the sSFR
to the sSFR of the MS at the same stellar mass and redshift (∆MS = sSFR/sSFRMS ). The threshold in Barro
et al. (2017a) is ∆MS = −0.7 dex, which corresponds
to ∼ 2.5σ below the MS. cSFGs are galaxies above this
threshold in star formation.
For our analysis we worked with the cosmological
fields COSMOS (Scoville et al. 2007) and GOODS-North
(Dickinson et al. 2003). As a starting point, we employed the 3D-HST survey catalogs (Brammer et al.
2012; Skelton et al. 2014; Whitaker et al. 2014; Momcheva et al. 2016) in the CANDELS (Grogin et al.
2011; Koekemoer et al. 2011) portion of COSMOS and
GOODS-North, from which we collected stellar masses,
SFRs, and redshifts. The structural parameters were
gathered from the associated catalogs in van der Wel
et al. (2014). We trimmed the catalogs following Barro
et al. (2017a): 1) 0.5 < z < 3.0, to guarantee that Barro
et al. (2017a) structural relations exist; 2) log M∗ > 9.0
for SFGs, log M∗ > 10.0 for QGs, and HF160W < 25.5,
to guarantee that the minimum requirements in the validity of the structural parameters are fulfilled (van der
Wel et al. 2012, 2014), where sources flagged as catastrophic failures in the surface brightness profile fits were
excluded. van der Wel et al. (2012, 2014) showed that
the effective radius (re ) and Sérsic index (n) have uncertainties < 10% for galaxies HF160W < 24.5, and
discussed that a redshift-dependent mass threshold of
log M∗ > 8.5–9.75 for SFGs and log M∗ > 9.0–10.3 for
QGs at 0.5 < z < 3.0 guarantees that the galaxies are
HF160W < 24.5. Barro et al. (2017a) chose log M∗ > 9.0
for SFGs and log M∗ > 10.0 for QGs as a good compromise between dynamical range in stellar mass and
accuracy in the structural parameters. To trace approximately the same rest-frame wavelength as a function of
redshift we used the structural parameters derived in the
JF125W -band at z < 1.5 and HF160W -band at z ≥ 1.5.
We refer to the sample resulting from this selection as
our parent optical sample, which is composed of 13703
galaxies (7222 in COSMOS and 6481 in GOODS-North)
with 416 cSFGs (227 in COSMOS and 189 in GOODSNorth).

2.2. Far-Infrared Sample
The ”super-deblended” FIR to submillimeter photometric catalogs in COSMOS (Jin et al. 2018) and
GOODS-North (Liu et al. 2018) provided fluxes from
highly-confused low-resolution data to optical counterparts by using a mix of priors based on high-spatial resolution bands (Spitzer /MIPS 24 µm, VLA 1.4, and 3 GHz
for COSMOS; Spitzer /MIPS 24 µm, VLA 1.4 GHz for
GOODS-North). We trimmed these catalogs to sources
with a combined signal-to-noise S/NFIR+mm ≥ 5 (where
S/NFIR+mm is the quadrature-sum of the S/N in all
λ ≥ 100 µm bands in the catalogs (Liu et al. 2018; Jin
et al. 2018)). We refer to the sample resulting from this
selection as our FIR sample, which is composed of 968
galaxies (357 in COSMOS and 611 in GOODS-North)
with 73 cSFGs (26 in COSMOS and 47 in GOODSNorth).
2.2.1. Rayleigh-Jeans and Radio Subsets
We separated a subset of galaxies in the FIR sample that have at least one detection at S/N ≥ 3 above
a rest-frame wavelength of 250 µm, so-called RayleighJeans (R-J) side of the FIR spectral energy distribution (SED), required to obtain gas mass estimates (Section 2.2.2). This comprises our R-J subset of the FIR
sample, composed of 59 galaxies (24 in COSMOS and
35 in GOODS-North) with 5 cSFGs (4 in COSMOS and
1 in GOODS-North).
Additionally, we cross-matched our FIR catalog with
radio catalogs from the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) at 325 MHz and 610 MHz in COSMOS
(Tisanić et al. 2019) and at 610 MHz in GOODS-North
(Magnelli et al. 2015). Besides, we substitued the COSMOS ”super-deblended” FIR catalog 3 GHz measurements for those in the COSMOS-XS survey (D. van der
Vlugt et al. 2019, in preparation; H. Algera et al. 2019,
in preparation) for overlapping sources in both catalogs,
given the increased depth of the latter survey. We looked
for radio counterparts within the half power beam width
(HPBW) at each frequency. We separated a subset of
galaxies that have at least two S/N ≥ 5 detections at any
available radio frequency (325 MHz, 610 MHz, 1.4 GHz,
and 3 GHz in COSMOS; 610 MHz, 1.4 GHz, and 3 GHz
in GOODS-North), required for our radio diagnostic
analysis (Section 4.3). This comprises our radio subset of the FIR sample, composed of 60 galaxies (23 in
COSMOS and 37 in GOODS-North) with 7 cSFGs (2 in
COSMOS and 5 in GOODS-North).
2.2.2. Far-infrared Properties
We derived infrared luminosities (LIR ) and infraredbased star formation rates (SFRIR ) for our FIR sample.

4

Gómez-Guijarro et al.

In order to derive these quantities, we first fitted the
mid-IR-to-millimeter SED using the Draine & Li (2007)
models. These models linearly combine two dust components, one coming from the diffuse ISM and one heated
by a power-law distribution of starlight associated with
photodissociation regions (PDRs). The methodology
was presented in detail in previous studies (e.g., Magdis
et al. 2012, 2017; Berta et al. 2016). We also included an
active galactic nuclei component (AGN) to ensure that
the derived FIR properties account for star formation
only. The best fit to the models were derived through
χ2 minimization and the uncertainties were calculated
over 1000 realizations of the observed SED perturbing
the photometry within the errors. LIR was calculated
by integrating the best fit to the SED in the range 8–
1000 µm and SFRIR from the LIR to SFRIR conversion
in Kennicutt (1998) for a Chabrier IMF. One of the parameters derived from the fit is the dust mass (Mdust ),
which can be used to derive gas masses (Mgas ). In order
for the Mgas estimates to be reliable, it is required at
least one detection in the R-J side of the SED. Therefore, we derive Mgas only for our R-J subset of the FIR
sample. We used the metallicity-dependent gas-to-dust
mass ratio technique (δGD ), adopting the Mgas /Mdust –
Z relation of Magdis et al. (2012) (log(Mdust /Mgas ) =
(10.54 ± 1.0) − (0.99 ± 0.12) × (12 + log(O/H))), where
the gas-phase metallicity is calibrated using the Pettini
& Pagel (2004) scale. We assumed a solar metallicity
for all galaxies that corresponds to a Mgas /Mdust ∼ 90.
Another method to derive Mgas is the single band measurement of the dust continuum emission flux on the R-J
side of the SED (e.g., Scoville et al. 2014; Groves et al.
2015; Scoville et al. 2016; Schinnerer et al. 2016). Both
the δGD method and the single-band measurement of the
dust emission method from Scoville et al. (2016) yielded
consistent results on average, with a median and median
GD
R−J
absolute deviation ratio of Mgas
/Mgas
= 0.88 ± 0.41.
In the following we adopt Mgas estimates from the δGD
method since it employs all datapoints in the SED and,
particularly, when there are several detections in the R-J
side. Note that both methods account for the total gas
budget of the galaxies, including the molecular (MH2 )
and the atomic phases (MHI ).
2.3. Active Galactic Nuclei Flagging
AGN activity is known to correlate with star formation (e.g., Kauffmann et al. 2003; Schawinski et al. 2010;
Rodighiero et al. 2015) and to be present in a large fraction of cSFGs at 2 < z < 3 (Barro et al. 2014). We
kept track of the galaxies with evidence of AGN activity from several indicators for potential systematics
in the AGN population respect to the general popula-

tion. We flagged all the galaxies for which the AGN
fraction from our FIR SED modeling is ≥ 20%. In addition, we checked for X-ray bright AGN (log LX > 42.5,
absorption-corrected soft and hard X-ray luminosity)
in the COSMOS (Chandra COSMOS Legacy Survey;
Civano et al. 2016; Marchesi et al. 2016) and GOODSNorth (Xue et al. 2016) X-ray catalogs. Finally, we identified radio-excess AGN as those having a significantly
low FIR/radio ratio (q < 1.68) following Del Moro et al.
(2013). These AGN flagging accounts for unobscured
to relatively obscured bright AGN and radio loud AGN,
particularly for the FIR sample for which all AGN indicators are available. We found that 22% of the massive
(log M∗ ≥ 10.3) cSFGs have an AGN.
3. COMPACTNESS AND STAR FORMATION

In this section we explore the location of SFGs and
QGs with respect to the MS of star formation and the
structural relation of QGs.
For each galaxy in the parent optical sample we calculated ∆MS, adopting the MS definition of Whitaker
et al. (2014), and the distance to the compactness selection threshold in the core density based on the QGs
structural relation (∆ΣQGs = Σ1 /Σ1QGs ), adopting the
relation definition in Barro et al. (2017a), at its stellar
mass and redshift. We will refer to extended SFGs as
SFGs located at ∆ΣQGs < 1.0, as opposed to cSFGs
located at ∆ΣQGs > 1.0. Similarly, extended QGs are
QGs at ∆ΣQGs < 1.0 and compact QGs are QGs at
∆ΣQGs > 1.0.
Note that the SFRs in the 3D-HST catalogs are defined as SFRIR+UV = 1.09×10−10 (LIR +2.2LUV ), where
LIR is obtained through a conversion from the observed
Spitzer /MIPS 24 µm flux density to LIR (8–1000 µm)
based on a single template. LUV is the total integrated
rest-frame luminosity in the range 1216–3000 Å. For the
FIR sample (∼ 7% of the parent optical sample) we
substituted the SFRIR contribution for the one we obtained in Section 2.2.2, since it uses all the information
available in the FIR SED, as opposed to a single template which could dilute galaxies that intrinsically deviate from the template. We checked that making this
SFRIR substitution does not introduce a systematic bias
respect to Whitaker et al. (2014) MS definition, which
could alter our ∆MS values.
3.1. General Trends
In Figure 1 we present the ∆MS-∆ΣQGs plane for the
parent optical sample. The overall distribution reproduces the L-shape reported in Barro et al. (2017a), with
the population of cSFGs forming the knee between extended SFGs and cQGs. This was used as an argument in favour of cSFGs as progenitors of QGs at later

cSFGs as Old Starbursts Becoming Quiescent
times, implying that SFGs become compact before they
quench. Note that the majority of QGs are compact
QGs.
We also explored the behaviour of the ∆MS (Y axis)
per bins of ∆ΣQGs (X axis) in Figure 1. In order to do
so, we draw a violin plot, a combination of a box and
whiskers plot and a density plot to visualize the distribution of the data and its probability density. The violin
plot has the advantage of showing not only a discrete
median value per bin in the X axis, but also different
measurements of the scatter and the actual shape of the
distribution of the data in the Y axis.
Overall, galaxies start to transition smoothly towards
quiescence, since ∆MS decreases continuously for increasing ∆ΣQGs . Some extended SFGs quench forming
extended QGs as they build up their stellar cores. On
the other hand, the sharp transition region at ∆ΣQGs ∼
1.0 indicates that other galaxies become compact before
they quench as reported in Barro et al. (2017a). Some
extended SFGs become cSFGs and then compact QGs
as they build up their stellar cores. The latter would
be a more common track since the majority of QGs are
compact QGs. Note that it has to be consider that SFGs
do not evolve into QGs at the same epoch (i.e., redshift),
but into QGs at later times.
The behavior around the ∆ΣQGs ∼ 1.0 transition
threshold presents some remarkable features. In the bin
centered at ∆ΣQGs = 1.25, while the median ∆MS decreases abruptly reflecting the sharp transition region
mentioned above, the scatter in ∆MS increases in both
directions of the Y axis. Particularly, it is interesting
the fact that the upper extreme values increase respect
to the previous bin centered at ∆ΣQGs = 0.975. Even
in the bin centered at ∆ΣQGs = 1.75 the upper extreme
values still increase, although they are less frequent than
in the previous bin. This indicates that, at least some
of the galaxies make the transition by increasing their
sSFR and going above the scatter of the MS.
Furthermore, it is also interesting that the median
∆MS stays approximately constant up to ∆ΣQGs = 0.5
and systematically above the MS (∆MS = 1.25; ∼
0.1 dex). This indicates that, while the MS is dominated
by galaxies in the extended phase, there is a contribution from more compact galaxies in transition towards
quiescence that affects the overall trend that defines the
MS lowering its normalization. Another interesting fact
is that extended SFGs above the scatter of the MS are
far more numerous than cSFGs above the scatter of the
MS.

3.2. Redshift Dependence

5

In addition to the ∆MS-∆ΣQGs plane for the whole
redshift range studied, we also present the results in the
redshift bins 0.5 < z < 1.5 and 1.5 < z < 3.0 in Figure 1.
The general trends are similar at low and high redshift,
although there are some important differences. At 1.5 <
z < 3.0 the median ∆MS up to ∆ΣQGs = 0.5 is higher
(∆MS = 1.35) than at 0.5 < z < 1.5 (∆MS = 1.16).
This indicates that the MS is more affected at the highredshift bin than at the low-redshift bin by galaxies that
are already in transition towards quiescence and that
lower its normalization.
3.3. Trends for Massive Galaxies
The ∆MS-∆ΣQGs planes discussed above follow the
selection criteria explained in Section 2.1. Particularly,
the stellar mass limits are log M∗ > 9.0 for SFGs,
log M∗ > 10.0 for QGs. At log M∗ ≥ 10.3 the sample is complete for both SFGs and QGs at z < 3.0 (van
der Wel et al. 2014) (see also Skelton et al. 2014; Tal
et al. 2014; Barro et al. 2017a). Therefore, we explored
the ∆MS-∆ΣQGs plane for the most massive galaxies
log M∗ ≥ 10.3 in Figure 2.
Overall, the trends are similar than those discussed in
the previous section. Note that the sample statistics are
smaller in this case, which has to be taken in consideration when interpreting the plots. One important difference is that the median ∆MS is not approximately constant up to ∆ΣQGs = 0.5 anymore, but it rather starts to
decay since the first bin centered at ∆ΣQGs = 0.1. This
is expected as a consequence of massive galaxies being
more dominated by galaxies that are already in transition towards quiescence than low-mass galaxies. In this
case we do not appreciate differences in the ∆MS at
∆ΣQGs = 0.1 at low redshift (∆MS = 1.27) and high
redshift (∆MS = 1.25), which indicates that the trend
in Section 3 was dominated by low-mass galaxies. Another important difference is that the number of galaxies
above the scatter of the MS respect to those within the
scatter of the MS is smaller for massive galaxies. Besides, outliers are less strong (i.e., smaller ∆MS), as expected given that for the same increase in SFR the effect
in sSFR is smaller as galaxies become more massive.
4. ARE COMPACT STAR-FORMING GALAXIES

NORMAL STAR-FORMING GALAXIES OR
STARBURSTS?
cSFGs have been proposed as a transition population
between being star-forming and quiescence (e.g., Barro
et al. 2013, 2014; Nelson et al. 2014; Williams et al. 2014;
van Dokkum et al. 2015). Revealing their nature implies
revealing whether the transition to quiescence occurred
secularly or rapidly. Phases of abrupt changes in increasing sSFR are typical of SBs. The time a galaxy is

detectable in such phase is short, since these are shortlived (e.g., Tacconi et al. 2008; Di Matteo et al. 2008).
This means that the number of detectable SBs is small
compared to the general population, but the phase can
still be very relevant in terms of stellar mass assembly. We examined three diagnostics of the burstiness of
star formation: 1) SFE, 2) ISM, and 3) radio emission.
The aim is exploring whether cSFGs can be considered
normal SFGs, pointing to a more secular evolution, or
SBs, pointing to a more rapid evolution. We refer to
normal SFGs as those that obey the general trends of
SFGs in each diagnostic. Conversely, SBs are outliers to
these general trends in each diagnostic (see diagnostics
Sections for a more detailed explanation). These definitions of normal SFGs and SBs are independent of their
position with respect to the MS. The latter would be a
consequence of the physical mechanisms in place (related
to our diagnostics) and the effect of these mechanisms
on the integrated properties of the galaxies at the time
of observation. Note also that the galaxies selected for
each of the three diagnostics are not the same sources
as the selections do not overlap.
4.1. Diagnostic 1: Star Formation Efficiency
The star formation law or Kennicutt-Schmidt relation
(KS relation; Schmidt 1959; Kennicutt 1998) relates the
gas mass and the SFR of SFGs (originally defined using
surface densities). Several studies indicated that normal
SFGs and SBs follow different trends. SBs have higher
SFR per unit of gas mass and, thus, higher star formation efficiencies (SFE = SFR/Mgas ) than normal SFGs
(e.g., Daddi et al. 2010b; Genzel et al. 2010). This distinction in SFE serves to distinguish normal SFGs from
SBs, regardless of their location with respect to the MS.
In this section we apply this SFE-based definition of
normal SFGs and SBs.
In Figure 3 we present the locus of our R-J subset of
the FIR sample in the Mgas -SFR plane in relation with
the trends for normal SFGs and SBs in Sargent et al.
(2014), where the normal SFGs trend comes from massive MS galaxies in Sargent et al. (2014). Note that
we only included the most massive subset of galaxies
with log M∗ ≥ 10.3, to guarantee that the assumption
of solar metallicity to derive Mgas is valid. We also
included Elbaz et al. (2018) sample, calculating their
∆ΣQGs and assessing whether they are extended SFGs
or cSFGs, according to Barro et al. (2017a) criterion.
This can be successfully done for 18/19 galaxies in Elbaz et al. (2018) as one of the galaxies has bad structural parameters in van der Wel et al. (2014) catalogs
(shown with a gray symbol in Figure 3). In Figure 3
we also explore the relation between SFE, gas fraction

(fgas = Mgas /(M∗ + Mgas )), and ∆MS, being SFE and
fgas normalized to the normal SFGs trends as defined
by the MS galaxies trends in Sargent et al. (2014).
cSFGs in our sample are consistent with the SFE trend
established for normal SFGs. Besides, the extended
SFGs in our sample follow the normal SFGs SFE trend
as well. Our sample is located within and above the
scatter of the MS. The SFE-fgas plane exhibits a tendency, being galaxies with lower SFE those with higher
fgas , as expected for galaxies that decrease their SFE as
a consequence of increasing their gas content. On the
other hand, Elbaz et al. (2018) sample occupies complementary regions in these diagrams respect to our sample, exhibiting enhanced SFE closer to those of the SBs
trend due to low gas fractions. Although beyond the
scope of our work, the ∆MS-SFE and ∆MS-fgas planes
reflect the general trends of incresing SFE and fgas with
∆MS reported in the literature (e.g., Scoville et al. 2017;
Tacconi et al. 2018).
These diagrams indicate that our cSFGs are consistent
with the trends of normal SFGs with no evidence of SBlike SFE. The combination of our sample with Elbaz
et al. (2018) sample indicates that there is no difference
between cSFGs and extended SFGs in terms of their
SFE, since both occupy the same regions in the SFE
and fgas parameter space.
Overall, these results based on the relations among
Mgas , stellar mass, and SFR, point towards both secular
(lower SFE) and rapid (higher SFE) evolution processes
are able to generate cSFGs.
4.2. Diagnostic 2: Interstellar Medium
4.2.1. CO Excitation
The properties of the ISM are a critical piece of information to study how star formation occurs. The excitation of the CO emission is a good tracer of the ISM
properties. It is measured through the line luminosity
ratio of CO lines with different rotational number (J).
The CO (5 − 4)/CO (2 − 1) ratio shows the biggest discrepancy between normal SFGs and SBs excitation conditions than any other pair of CO transitions calibrated
in the literature (e.g., Bothwell et al. 2013; Daddi et al.
2015). Daddi et al. (2015) established a benchmark for
the excitation conditions of normal SFGs by studying a
sample of BzK-selected SFGs at z ∼ 1.5 located within
the scatter of the MS. They found that, while less excited than typical SBs such as local ULIRGs or highredshift SMGs, the average excitation was higher than
in the Milky Way. The authors argued that the excitation correlates with the star formation surface density. This, along with the fact that the excitation varied
within the sample, motivated us to study whether some

Sargent et al. (2014) are shown as reference. Panel B: SFE-fgas plane. Panel C: ∆MS-SFE plane. Panel D: ∆MS-fgas plane.
SFE and fgas are normalized to the normal SFGs trends in Sargent et al. (2014). The 1σ scatter of the MS (∼ 0.3 dex; e.g.,
Whitaker et al. 2012; Schreiber et al. 2015) and the normal SFGs SFE (∼ 0.2 dex; Sargent et al. 2014) and fgas (∼ 0.125 dex;
Sargent et al. 2014) trends are represented as a blue shaded region. Our sample and Elbaz et al. (2018) sample are shown,
classified as extended SFGs (blue circles) or cSFGs (green triangles), except for one of Elbaz et al. (2018) galaxies (gray circle)
unclassifiable due to bad structural parameters. AGN-flagged galaxies are represented with empty symbols. In panels B and
D the most favorable fgas limit in our selection is shown as a gray shaded region as a reference of the detection threshold (see
Section 5).

of Daddi et al. (2015) galaxies are cSFGs. In this section
we refer to normal SFGs as those consistent with the CO
spectral line energy distribution (SLED) of Daddi et al.
(2015) BzK-selected MS galaxies, while we refer to SBs
as those consistent with the median CO SLED of SMGs
from Bothwell et al. (2013).
We cross-matched our parent optical sample with the
galaxies in Daddi et al. (2015). We found three of
our galaxies, namely GN2359, GN20044, and GN23304,
which correspond to BzK-4171, BzK-16000, and BzK-

17999 in Daddi et al. (2015), respectively. The missing
galaxy BzK-21000 in Daddi et al. (2015) corresponds
to GN38099. Its structural parameters are poorly constrained and, thus, it was excluded from our sample. For
the analysis in this section we added it back bearing in
mind this caveat. In Figure 4 we show the SLEDs in
Daddi et al. (2015) for these four galaxies. In Table 4
we present their ∆MS and ∆ΣQGs values.
All four galaxies are extended SFGs and not cSFGs.
However, we see that the three galaxies with the high-

10

Gómez-Guijarro et al.

est ∆MS are the ones with the highest CO excitation
(GN2359, GN23304, and GN38099), while the other
galaxy located right on the MS is the one with the lowest
CO excitation (GN20044).
The galaxies with the highest CO excitation are also
those with the highest star formation surface density
according to Daddi et al. (2015), suggesting that the
scatter at higher ∆MS is linked to galaxies progressively
forming compact cores.

4.2.2. Photodissociation Regions
Another way of studying the ISM properties is
through characterizing the emission from photodissociation regions (PDRs). PDRs are neutral gas regions
dominated by far-ultraviolet (FUV) photons. PDR
modeling have been used to characterize the strength
of the ultraviolet radiation field (G) and the density
of the neutral gas (n) (e.g., Alaghband-Zadeh et al.
2013; Popping et al. 2017). In particular, Popping et al.
(2017) employed it to characterize the ISM properties
of a cSFGs at z = 2.225 located within the scatter of
the MS (namely GS30274). They found that the galaxy
has SB-like ISM properties, low gas fraction, and high
efficiency compared to normal SFGs. The authors interpreted that a previous merger event triggered a central
starburst that is quickly building up a dense core of
stars responsible for the compact distribution of stellar
light. We studied whether galaxies in our sample are
similar. In this section we refer to normal SFGs as
those consistent with the location of the sample of MS
galaxies from Malhotra et al. (2001) in the G-n plane,
while we refer to SBs as those consistent with the location of the sample of local ULIRGS from Davies et al.
(2003) in the G-n plane, identical to the definition used
in Alaghband-Zadeh et al. (2013); Popping et al. (2017).
Valentino et al. (2018) presented a survey of atomic
carbon [C I] of FIR-selected galaxies on the MS at
z ∼ 1.2. We cross-matched our parent optical sample
with the galaxies in Valentino et al. (2018). We found
that one of our extended SFGs was observed in that
survey, namely COS24563 (which corresponds to 18538
in Valentino et al. (2018)). We performed PDR modeling for this galaxy and also for GS30274 in Popping
et al. (2017) for consistency in the methodology and to
avoid systematics in the comparison. Besides, we calculated GS30274 ∆ΣQGs and checked that it is a cSFGs
according to Barro et al. (2017a) criterion. Note that
the structural parameters of GS30274 are poorly constrained, as also mentioned in Popping et al. (2017),
and do not meet the same quality criteria applied to our
sample. In Figure 4 we locate the two modeled galaxies

in the the G-n plane. In Table 4 we present the ∆MS
and ∆ΣQGs values for them.
We estimated the density n (in cm−3 ) and the strength
of the FUV (6 eV < hν < 13.6 eV ) radiation field G (in
the Habing field units, G0 = 1.6 × 10−3 erg cm−2 s−1 )
by comparing the available line luminosities with the 1D
modeling of the PDRs by Kaufman et al. (1999, 2006).
This modeling provides a simplified picture of the complex cold ISM phases and their interplay in high-redshift
galaxies, but it is enough to capture the average properties of these unresolved systems, without introducing a
large number of parameters that cannot be observationally constrained at the current stage. We downloaded
the relevant line intensity maps from the online PDR
Toolbox (Pound & Wolfire 2008), originally spanning
a density interval of 1 < log n[cm−3 ] < 7 and FUV intensity range of −0.5 < log(G/G0 ) < 6.5 and we resampled them to a 0.05 dex step grid. We then compared the models and the observations finding the combination of (n,G) that minimizes the χ2 . We estimated
the uncertainties on the best fit (n,G) both applying
the criterion described in Avni (1976) and bootstrapping 1000 times the line luminosities and computing
the 68%, 90%, and 95% confidence intervals as interpercentile ranges. In this work we modeled the neutral
atomic carbon 3 P1 →3 P0 transition ([C I](3 P1 −3 P0 ),
νrest = 492.161 GHz), a mid-J CO line (CO (4 − 3) or
CO (5 − 4) at νrest = 461.0408 and 576.2679 GHz, respectively), and the total infrared luminosity (LIR ) removing the possible AGN contribution due to the dusty
torus around the central supermassive black hole (see
Section 2.2.2). The [C I](3 P1 −3 P0 )/mid-J ratio is primarily sensitive to the density. The use of CO (4 − 3) or
CO (5−4) as the CO mid-J transition does not affect the
results on the density (F. Valentino et al. 2019, in preparation). [C I](3 P1 −3 P0 )/LIR depends on G by construction (G ∝ LIR , Kaufman et al. (1999)). We thus have
roughly perpendicular tracks to determine both (n,G)
parameters (e.g., Alaghband-Zadeh et al. 2013; Popping
et al. 2017).
COS24563 and GS30274 have similar properties as
seen in Figure 4. They are both located in the intersection between normal SFGs and SBs ISM properties.
COS24563 is placed at a ∆MS slightly above the scatter
of the MS, suggesting that the scatter at higher ∆MS is
linked to galaxies progressively forming compact cores,
similar to the interpretation drawn from the CO excitation.
Overall, the ISM properties from both the CO excitation and PDR modeling suggest that extended SFGs
located slightly above the MS (upper-MS galaxies) are
capable of hosting an ISM that appears mildly excited

and dense similar to the lower envelope of SB-like ISM
properties. This suggest that the build-up of a compact
core leading to cSFGs could happen secularly, or at least
that if coming from the product of a rapid starburstlike event the latent ISM has similar properties to that
of upper-MS normal SFGs. However, the small sample
sizes and the lack of ISM characterization of cSFGs in
this work and over the literature makes it is still difficult
to conclude whether the shown ISM properties are the
product of a slow secular evolution or the final stages of
SBs pointing towards a more rapid evolution.
4.3. Diagnostic 3: Radio Emission

The FIR/radio correlation (FRC; e.g., de Jong et al.
1985; Helou et al. 1985; Condon 1992) arises because
massive stars (M∗ > 8 M ) are responsible for producing ultraviolet photons that are absorbed and re-emitted
by dust at FIR wavelengths, and also responsible for accelerating cosmic ray electrons after exploding as supernovae that produces the synchrotron emission at radio
wavelengths. Bressan et al. (2002) modeled the FIR and
radio emission of SBs, studying the interplay between
the two with the age of the starburst episode and their
effect on the FIR/radio ratio (q ∝ LIR /Lradio ) and the
slope of the power law radio spectrum (S ∝ ν −α ), introducing the q1.4GHz -α diagram as a diagnostic of SBs
age evolution. During the very early phase after the
star formation ignites, SBs are dominated by FIR emission since only thermal free-free emission from HII regions contributes to the radio emission. At this stage
the radio slope is shallow (α ∼ 0.2) and the radio output is low compared to FIR (q1.4GHz ∼ 3). Then, corecollapse supernovae explosions occur, feeding relativistic electrons to the galactic magnetic fields, and nonthermal synchrotron emission steepens the radio spectrum increasing at the same time the radio output. At
this stage the radio slope progressively gets similar to
the value typical of normal SFGs (α ∼ 0.8) and the
FIR/radio ratio progressively decreases to a minimum

12

Gómez-Guijarro et al.

value (q1.4GHz ∼ 1.7). At older ages, the FIR/radio ratio increases again at almost constant radio slope (α and
q1.4GHz reach asymptotic values). These models were
first observationally tested by Thomson et al. (2014) for
870 µm-selected SMGs. The authors found that the data
populated the predicted region of the parameter space
and the stellar masses tend to increase along the SBs
evolutionary tracks in the q1.4GHz -α diagram. We explored the location of our galaxies in this diagram as
another diagnostic of their nature. In this section we refer to normal SFGs to the typical SFGs average values
of α = 0.80 ± 0.25 (e.g., Condon 1992; Ibar et al. 2009,
2010) and q1.4GHz = 2.34 ± 0.26 in the local universe
(e.g., Yun et al. 2001).
We calculated α and q1.4GHz for the galaxies in the radio subset of the FIR sample. α was obtained through
fitting a single power law to the data (χ2 minimization). This corresponds to the slope in the range
325 MHz–3 GHz for galaxies in COSMOS and 610 MHz–
1.4 GHz for galaxies in GOODS-North. The FIR/ratio
at 1.4GHz is defined as:
LIR [W]
− log(L1.4GHz [W Hz−1 ]),
3.75 × 1012 [Hz]
(2)
(e.g., Helou et al. 1985; Yun et al. 2001; Magnelli et al.
2015), where L1.4GHz was calculated via the single power
law to the data. The uncertainties were obtained over
10000 realizations of the observed radio SED perturbing
the photometry within the errors. In Figure 5 we present
the locus of our radio subset of the FIR sample in the
q1.4GHz -α plane along with the SBs evolutionary tracks
from Bressan et al. (2002).
The distribution of galaxies scatters around the normal SFGs values with some outliers. Among the outliers
we found ultra-steep spectrum galaxies (USS; α > 1),
typically with low Lradio . A similar distribution of galaxies was found in Thomson et al. (2014). The nature of
USS galaxies is debated and beyond the scope of our
work. Early-stage mergers are capable of steepening the
radio spectrum enhancing the radio emission (Murphy
2013). Thomson et al. (2014) also argued that an alternative scenario of USS are galaxies with radio jet emission truncated by interactions with dense gas in their
environments (O’Dea 1998).
The location of cSFGs seems to be slightly biased towards Bressan et al. (2002) tracks at older ages (220–
400 Myr). We checked whether there exists a trend in
∆ΣQGs and, thus, in compactness along Bressan et al.
(2002) tracks. Following Thomson et al. (2014), we
divide the parameter space overlapping with Bressan
et al. (2002) tracks in three boxes representing young

spectrum could bias the interpretation. We found that

0.55 ± 0.63. These values correspond to the median and
the uncertainty is given by the median absolute deviation (MAD). Note that since the increase in compactness
is a continuous function, we expect the scatter of each
bin given by the MAD to overlap (as in Figure 1). We
did not find a similar trend in the case of the stellar
mass as reported in Thomson et al. (2014), although
to make a proper comparison selection effects should be
considered.
Overall, we find a trend of increasing compactness
with the age evolution of a starburst episode, leading
to cSFGs at the final stages. This indicates that cSFGs
could be old SBs, while extended SFGs could be a mix
of normal SFGs and young SBs.
5. DISCUSSION

5.1. Compactness, Star Formation, and the
Diagnostics of Burstiness
In Section 3 we presented the distribution of the general galaxy population in the ∆MS-∆ΣQGs plane. The
general evolutionary trend of the galaxy population is
given by the L-shape, previously reported in Barro et al.
(2017a). Extended SFGs become compact before they
quench (see Figure 6, for a schematic plot). We stress
that SFGs do not evolve into QGs at the same epoch
(i.e., redshift), but into QGs at later times.
Furthermore, we showed two additional behaviours of
the general evolutionary trend of the galaxy population:
1) galaxies start to transition smoothly towards quiescence, as the median sSFR decreases continuously for

400 Myr) SBs are expected to be located. AGN-flagged galaxies are represented with empty symbols. Note that some AGNflagged sources fall outside the plotted region, but we zoom in the area of interest.

increasing compactness; 2) at least some of the SFGs
galaxies become compact by increasing their sSFR and
going above the scatter of the MS, given the large scatter and upper extreme values around the ∆ΣQGs ∼ 1.0
compactness transition threshold.
In Section 4 we examined three indicators of the
burstiness of star formation: 1) SFE, 2) ISM, and 3)
radio emission.
Regarding SFE there is no difference between cSFGs
and extended SFGs. The similar values for cSFGs and
extended SFGs extend to various regimes. There are
both cSFGs and extended SFGs with low SFE due to

high gas fractions, also both cSFGs and extended SFGs
with enhanced SFE, some of which have enhanced SFE
due to low gas fractions (see Figure 3). All together,
it suggests that compactness could arise from different
origins, like an extended normal SFG with low efficiency
and a large gas reservoir that is secularly growing its
stellar core, or an extended SB with enhanced efficiency
that is rapidly consuming its gas reservoir growing its
stellar core.
In terms of the ISM, the mild excitation and density
values for extended SFGs in the upper-MS (see Figure 4
and Table 4) are in line with Tacchella et al. (2016)

scenario, which related the scatter of the MS to the evolution of galaxies following compaction events as part of
the secular evolution of SFGs (e.g., Dekel et al. 2013;
Zolotov et al. 2015; Tacchella et al. 2016). If coming
from the product of a rapid starburst-like event the latent ISM has similar properties to that of upper-MS normal SFGs.
On the other hand, regarding the radio emission diagnostic the increasing compactness with the expected
age evolution of the radio emission in SBs leads to the
conclusion of cSFGs could be old SBs. Note also that
most of the galaxies are above the scatter of the MS in
this part of the analysis, particularly in the old age bin.
It suggests that the galaxies displaying high sSFR going
above the scatter of the MS when becoming cSFGs (see
Figure 1) are old SBs.
The analysis carried out in our work was performed
in an unresolved fashion. This could be the reason of
the apparent contradictory conclusions drawn from the
SFE and ISM diagnostics versus the radio emission diagnostic. The conclusions drawn from the ISM and SFE
diagnostics can be reconciled with that of the radio emission diagnostic if the SFE and ISM properties do not
dominate the entire galaxy in an old SB phase. In that
case the galaxy would not display an overall (unresolved)
high SFE or SB-like ISM (see Renaud et al. 2019). This
scenario would be also supported by the handful of resolved follow-up studies of the ISM of cSFGs, which indicate an undergoing nuclear starburst (e.g., Spilker et al.

et al. 2017; Talia et al. 2018).

5.2. Star Formation Efficiency and Selection Limits
We indicated in Section 4.1 that the combination of
our sample with Elbaz et al. (2018) sample implied no
difference between cSFGs and extended SFGs in terms
of their SFE. However, it could be the case that Elbaz
et al. (2018) galaxies are closer to the ∆ΣQGs ∼ 1.0 transition threshold, particularly for the subset with high
SFE and low fgas that could be on the last stage before
becoming quiescent. In Figure 7 we show the location
of both samples in the ∆MS-∆ΣQGs plane to explore
this scenario. We did not find evidence that that the
latter is the case as we do not see any distinction between our sample and Elbaz et al. (2018) sample in the
∆MS-∆ΣQGs plane.
In Section 4.1 we also mentioned that our sample and
Elbaz et al. (2018) sample are located in distinct complementary regions in the different diagrams shown Figure 3. For instance, we did not find galaxies with simultaneously high SFE and low fgas within our sample,
the galaxies described in Elbaz et al. (2018) as SBs that
also fall within the scatter of the MS. Elbaz et al. (2018)
galaxies occupy a parameter space offset form our sample, which made us consider the possibility that our selection is biased against the detection of SBs within the
MS.

cSFGs as Old Starbursts Becoming Quiescent
The R-J subset of the FIR sample was selected to fulfill a detection criteria in the R-J side of the FIR SED;
therefore, establishing a detection limit for the different
bands available in the R-J side of the ”super-deblended”
FIR catalogs in COSMOS and GOODS-North. For
0.5 < z < 3.0 galaxies these bands are Herschel /SPIRE
500 µm, SCUBA 850 µm, AzTEC 1.1 mm, and MAMBO
1.2 mm. We explored the required fluxes in these bands
as a function of redshift to be able to detect galaxies
that, while located within the scatter of the MS, exhibited enhanced SFE. We employed Scoville et al. (2016)
technique to predict the single band flux measurement
of the dust continuum expected for a given Mgas . In Figure 8 we plot the predicted fluxes for the different bands
as function of redshift for galaxies with a SFE three
times higher (Mgas three times lower) than the normal
SFGs SFE trend at fixed stellar mass for a range of SFRs
equivalent to ∆MS = 3 both above and below the MS.
Only galaxies with M∗ ≥ 5 × 1011 M start to be detectable. These detection limits are consistent with the
fact that we did not detect galaxies with enhanced SFE
within the scatter of the MS. In Figure 3 we show as
a reference the most favorable fgas limit (gray shaded
region), which would correspond to a galaxy that has a
stellar mass as high as the highest stellar mass of the
sample (log M∗ = 11.73) and located at a redshift such
that the predicted detectable fgas given the flux limits
at the different bands in the two fields results in a minimum. Even in this extreme case, since there is not a
galaxy in our sample that fulfills all the criteria at the
same time, justifies that we missed galaxies with simultaneously high SFE and low fgas , like the ones presented
in Elbaz et al. (2018).
Therefore, we did not find SB-like SFE within the MS
due to the detection limits in the catalogs.

6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this work we studied the general population of
galaxies based on their location with respect to fundamental star-forming and structural relations, and classified them in extended, compact SFGs, and QGs. Based
on a methodology of three diagnostics of the burstiness
of star formation: 1) SFE, 2) ISM, and 3) radio emission,
we aimed at studying whether cSFGs can be considered
normal SFGs or SBs. As a proposed immediate transition population towards QGs, unveiling the nature of
cSFGs implies understanding how the build-up of compact stellar cores and subsequent quenching of star formation happens. If cSFGs were normal SFGs it would
point towards a secular transition towards quiescence
and, conversely, a SB nature of cSFGs would point to-

15

wards a more rapid transition towards quiescence. In
summary we found:
• The distribution of galaxies in the ∆MS-∆ΣQGs
plane reveal that galaxies transition smoothly towards quiescence with increasing compactness.
Some extended SFGs quench forming extended
QGs. Most of the extended SFGs become compact before they quench, in agreement with (Barro
et al. 2017a). Furthermore, at least some galaxies
become compact going above the scatter of the
MS.
• The MS is dominated by extended SFGs. However, SFGs with increasing compactness that are
transitioning to quiescence contribute to lower the
normalization of the MS.
• There is no evidence for a distinct SFE in cSFGs
and extended SFGs, suggesting that both secular
and rapid evolution processes could generate cSFGs.
• Extended SFGs located slightly above the MS
(upper-MS galaxies) have ISM properties (CO excitation, density of the neutral gas, and strength
of the ultraviolet) similar to lower envelope of SBlike ISM properties, and seem also similar to those
of cSFG (with the caveat of the small sample sizes
and the lack of ISM characterization for cSFGs).
This suggest that the growth of a compact stellar core leading to cSFGs could happen secularly.
Another explanation could be that if coming from
a rapid starburst event, the latent ISM in cSFGs
retains similar properties to that of upper-MS normal SFGs.
• There is evidence for a trend in increasing compactness with the expected age evolution of the
radio emission in SBs, indicating that cSFGs could
be old SBs, while extended SFGs could be a mix
of normal SFGs and young SBs.
The relative importance of a secular or rapid transition towards quiescence as a function of redshift
remains to be completely understood. The apparent contradictory conclusions drawn from the
SFE and ISM diagnostics versus the radio emission
diagnostic can be reconciled if the SFE and ISM
properties do not dominate the entire galaxy in an
old SB phase, in agreement with resolved follow-up
studies in the literature. We suggest that cSFGs
could be SBs winding down and eventually crossing the main sequence towards quiescence.
