Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries have attracted enormous interests recently as promising power
sources. However, the safety issue associated with the employment of highly flammable liquid
electrolyte impedes the further development of next-generation lithium-ion batteries. Recently,
researchers reported the use of electrospun core-shell fiber as the battery separator consisting of
polymer layer as protective shell and flame retardants loaded inside as core. In case of a typical
battery shorting, the protective polymer shell melts during thermal-runaway and the flame
retardants inside would be released to suppress the combustion of the electrolyte. Due to the use of
a single precursor solution for electrospinning containing both polymer and flame retardants, the
weight ratio of flame retardants is limited and dependent. Herein, we developed a dual-nozzle,
coaxial electrospinning approach to fabricate the core-shell nanofiber with a greatly enhanced
flame retardants weight percentage in the final fibers. The weight ratio of flame retardants of
triphenyl phosphate in the final composite reaches over 60 wt.%. The LiFePO4-based cell using this
composite nanofiber as battery separator exhibits excellent flame-retardant property without
compromising the cycling stability or rate performances. In addition, this functional nanofiber can
also be coated onto commercial separators instead of being used directly as separators.

1. Introduction
Lithium-ion battery (LIBs) has been considered as one of the most promising energy-storage
devices recently [1]. Although its energy density keeps increasing, battery safety is the prerequisite
for the further development and commercial realization [2-8]. The conventional LIBs use flammable
organic liquid electrolytes such as ethylene carbonate (EC), diethyl carbonate (DEC), and dimethyl
carbonate (DMC), leading to severe safety hazards (for example, fires and explosions). In the case of
short circuits, undesirable exothermic reactions from electrolyte decomposition will cause a rapid
increase in battery temperature as well as thermal runaway. The high temperature will cause the
ignition of the flammable electrolyte, eventually leading to fires or explosions. And this problem will
be even magnified with the use of next-generation high energy density LIBs [9-11].
Considerable efforts have been devoted to tackle the aforementioned issues, including the
utilization of: (1) non-flammable organic electrolytes or co-solvent [12-18]; (2) high concentration
electrolytes [19-21]; (3) electrolytes additives [22-25]. Generally, the non-flammable electrolytes and
co-solvents are based on fluorinated, phosphate and ionized liquids, which have high viscosities,
low solubility of salts, and are incompatible with common anode materials [19-20], resulting in the

poor electrochemical performances when used as LIB electrolytes. Moreover, high concentration
electrolytes always suffer from much higher viscosity, lower ionic conductivity and high costs,
hindering its practical applications [19]. So far, the most efficient and economical strategy is to add
flame-retardant electrolyte additives to lower the risk of fires or explosions [26-28]. However, this
improvement of battery safety is on the cost of battery performances since the presence of large
amount of flame retardants in the electrolyte would significantly lower the ionic conductivity [29].
Therefore, developing a method to eliminate the trade-off between the safety and the
electrochemical performance of the battery is of great importance for further development and
practical applications of next-generation LIBs.
Encapsulating flame retardants into separator provides a novel strategy. Recently, Cui et al. has
developed a novel electrospun core-shell microfiber structure with protective polymer layer as the
shell and triphenyl phosphate (TPP), a popular organophosphorus-based flame retardant confined
inside as the core [30]. The polymer shell which is the poly(vinylidene
fluoride–hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP), blocks the direct contact of TPP to electrolyte thus
preventing any negative effects of TPP on the electrochemical properties of the electrolyte. While the
TPP confined inside would be released to the electrolyte in case of a battery thermal-runaway since
PVDF-HFP shell would melt as the temperature increases. The released TPP in the electrolyte further
suppress the combustion of flammable organic electrolyte. It is worth noting that the amount of TPP
plays a key role on the flame-retardant effects [30]. As shown by Cui et al., the flammability of the
electrolyte is dramatically reduced with the increasing concentration of TPP. In addition, for a
commercial pouch cell, separator only accounts for around 5 wt.% of the total weight, therefore
higher TPP percentage in this composite needs to be achieved [30]. However, due to use of a
single-nozzle electrospinning from a single precursor solution in Cui’s work, the concentration of
TPP is limited [30]. Cui et al. demonstrated the fibrous composite with up to 40 wt.% of TPP [30].
Herein, by using a dual-nozzle, coaxial electrospinning method, we developed a flexible
fabrication method of core-shell nanofiber with large quantity of TPP up to more than 60 wt.%
encapsulated inside as separators for safe LIBs. In addition, the as-prepared fibrous material
displays a very uniform flame retardants distribution, with almost no noticeable agglomeration
observed. We further tested and confirmed the flame-retardant capability of the electrospun fiber
compared with commercial separator. Finally, the constructed half-cell using lithium iron phosphate
(LiFePO4) as cathodes, lithium metal as anode, and this electrospun fiber as separator delivered good
cycling and rate performance, with a stable specific capacity of 130 mAh g-1 at 1 C. And this indicates
the improvement of battery safety is achieved without compromising the battery performances too
much.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Materials: Poly(vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP, average Mw ≈
455,000, average Mn ≈ 110,000, pellets), dimethylacetamide (DMAc, 99.8%), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone
(NMP, 99.5%) and acetone (99.9%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. TPP was purchased from
Energy Chemical. All of these reagents were used without further purification. Electrolyte (1M
lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) dissolved in a mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl
carbonate (DMC) (v/v = 1:1), moisture ≤ 10 ppm), poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF, 99.5%), lithium
metal foil (99.9%), copper foil (12 µm, 99.8%), aluminum foil (16 ± 2 µm, 99.54%), carbon black C45
and coin-type cell CR2032 was purchased from MTI Shenzhen Kejing Star Technology. Two types of
commercial separators were used in this work. The commercial separator type I is a Celgard 2320
separator with polypropylene (PP)/polyethylene (PE)/PP trilayer and 20-μm thickness. The
commercial separator type II is a Celgard 2500 separator with PP layer and 25-μm thickness.
2.2. Methods: Dual nozzle coaxial electrospinning facility was purchased from Changsha
Nanoapparatus China, with inner radius 0.18 mm and outer radius 0.59 mm. In order to fabricate

desired fibrous materials with high content of flame retardant, the electrospinning precursor
solution for polymer shell was prepared by adding 18 wt.% PVDF-HFP in the mixture of
DMAc/acetone (w/w = 3:7), then the solution was stirred at room temperature for 6 h, followed by
ultrasonic treatment for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, the precursor solution for the core was prepared by
dissolving TPP (the mass percentage can be up to more than 60 wt.%) in the mixture of
DMAc/acetone (w/w = 3:7). During dual-nozzle coaxial electrospinning, the flow rates of the core
and shell solutions were 1.08 mL h-1 and 0.54 mL h-1, respectively, and the needle-to-collector
distance was about 15 cm. A high voltage of 15 kV was applied to the nozzle to start the spinning
process and the electrospun fibers were collected on a copper foil coated rotating drum (rotational
speed was about 150 r/min). The obtained membrane was washed by ethanol and dried at room
temperature.
2.3. Characterization: The thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA, Netzsch, STA 409 PC)
measurement was carried out in air flow at a heating rate of 10 oC min-1. The morphology and
elemental analysis of the fibrous material were characterized by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM, Hitachi, HT7700), scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi, SU-8010) and its energy
dispersive spectrometer (EDS, Hitachi, SU-8010). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS,
ULVAC-PHI, PHI Quantro SXM) was used to characterize the as-prepared samples.
2.4. Electrochemical Characterization: The electrochemical performance was examined using
CR2032 coin-type half-cells assembled in an argon-filled glove box with LiFePO4 as the working
electrode and lithium foil as the counter electrode. To prepare the LiFePO4 electrode, LiFePO4,
Carbon black C45 and PVDF with a mass ratio of 8:1:1 were dissolved in NMP to form a
homogeneous slurry. The slurry was coated onto current collector via a common doctor-blade
coating method, which was dried in a vacuum oven at 120 oC for 2h. The electrolyte is 1M LiPF6 in a
mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (v/v = 1:1). The galvanostatic
discharge-charge cycling was performed in land system (CT2001A) over a range of applied voltage
of 2.5-4.2 V at a constant C-rate of 0.25 C in the first 3 cycles for activation and at 1 C in the following
cycles.
2.5. Ignition Experiments: For the ignition experiments, firstly, all the separators/fiber networks
were folded four times and clamped with glass plates. Then the electrospun fibers were heated in air
from room temperature to 180 oC to release the flame retardants inside. After cooling to room
temperature, these fiber networks were wetted by a flammable electrolyte (1 M LiPF6 in a mixture of
EC and DMC (v/v = 1:1)).
3. Results

Figure 1. Schematic illustration of the coaxial electrospinning process using a dual nozzle. (a) The TPP and
PVDF-HFP solutions were injected by syringes into the core and shell channels of the nozzle, respectively. The
Taylor cone region was magnified as shown in the box. (b) The as-prepared electrospun fiber consists of TPP as
the core and PVDF-HFP as the shell. The confined flame retardants inside the core will be released to dissolve in
the electrolyte and suppress the combustion.

The fabrication process for our proposed core-shell nanofiber with high content of flame
retardants was vividly presented in Figure 1. The dual-nozzle coaxial electrospinning technique was
chosen to prepare the core-shell structure. PVDF-HFP as the protective layer was dissolved in a
mixture of dimethylacetamide (DMAc)/acetone (w/w = 3:7) while another mixture solution
containing TPP was injected into the core channel of the dual nozzle. During electrospinning, TPP
solution, as the central part, can be extruded through the inner capillary while the spinnable
PVDF-HFP polymer solution is extruded through the outer capillary. The protective polymer is
firstly precipitated from the outer solution such that the TPP can be uniformly dispersed and
encapsulated in the inner region (Figure 1a). It was worth noting that allowing the shell solution to
be extruded firstly was very important to establish a stable Taylor cone for the desired core-shell
structure. With a stable Taylor cone, the inner TPP solution could not leak easily to form
agglomeration or lead to non-homogeneous distribution in fibers (Figure S1). After the solutions
sprayed out from the nozzle tip, as the core and shell solution in contact, PVDF-HFP would be
precipitated immediately as a protection layer at the interface, thus preventing the TPP to diffuse
from inner to outer solution.
Morphology of the as-prepared electrospun fibers with high content of flame retardants was
examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM) as shown in Figure 2a-b. Though the diameter of
the electrospun fibers ranges from 200 nm to 500 nm, these fibers are very smooth and show almost
no agglomeration (Figure 2a-b). In addition, the as-prepared fiber network exhibits excellent

flexibility, which was demonstrated by rolling up on a pen and folding several times without any
cracks or structural damages (Figure S2).
In order to confirm the core-shell structure of our electrospun fibers (noted as
TPP@PVDF-HFP), transmission electron microscope (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDX) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were utilized. As illustrated in Figure 2d, the
boundary of the core region and shell region can be clearly observed, indicating the successful
encapsulation of TPP core in PVDF-HFP shell. According to our calculation (Figure S3), the polymer
shell thickness differs not too much with our observations from the TEM image (Figure 2d). To
examine the distribution of flame retardants inside the fiber, EDX and XPS were utilized. The EDX
elemental mapping shows the homogeneous distribution of C, F and P, implying uniform
distribution of TPP inside PVDF-HFP (Figure 2e). Furthermore, the coexistence of C and F elements
from the XPS spectra (Figure 2f) in the composite fiber indicated the existence of PVDF-HFP as the
shell, while no peaks of P element was detected, suggesting the successful encapsulation of TPP
inside as the core (Figure 2f). In addition, in case of a battery thermal runaway, the outer layer of the
fiber network (PVDF-HFP) melts and the inner TPP released into the electrolyte (Figure 2c), and this
can be confirmed from the appearance of characteristic peaks of elemental P in the XPS spectrum
after thermal runaway (Figure S4), which further proves the core-shell structure of the as-prepared
TPP@PVDF-HFP composite fiber.

The contents of flame retardant in the electrospun fibers were investigated by
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Herein, we prepared electrospun core-shell fibers with different
amount of flame retardants contained inside by adjusting the concentration of core TPP solution.
Theoretically, the concentration of TPP in the core solution can be related to the overall
concentration of TPP in the entire composite fiber according to our calculations. Specifically, the TPP
concentration in the core solution of 33.3 wt.%, 50.0 wt.% and 66.6 wt.% can be correlated to the final
composite fibers with 48 wt.%, 58 wt.% and 65 wt.% weight percentage of TPP (Figure S5). And this
calculation matches perfectly with the experimental observation as showed in Figure 2g from the
TGA analysis. The TPP showed an obvious weight loss in the range of 250 oC to 330 oC while the
decomposition of PVDF-HFP occurred at around 425 oC. For our coaxial electrospun fibers with TPP
confined in the PVDF-HFP shell, there are two stages for the weight loss in relevant to TPP and
PVDF-HFP decomposition, respectively, demonstrating the successful encapsulation of TPP inside.

Figure 3. Digital images showing the examination of flame-retardant properties of various separators/fiber
networks by ignition experiment. Images of (a1-a4) display the status just as the ignition starts for
TPP@PVDF-HFP fiber network, TPP@PVDF-HFP@commercial separator, commercial Celgard 2320 separator
and commercial Celgard 2500 separator, respectively. While images of (b1-b4) represent the corresponding
status after ignition.

In order to prove the flame-retardant property of the as-prepared core-shell composite fibers,
ignition experiments were carried out on our TPP@PVDF-HFP composite fibers compared with two
types of commercial separators (Celgard 2320 and Celgard 2500) (Figure 3a-b). In addition,
commercial separator (Celgard 2320) was also coated (Figure S6) by TPP@PVDF-HFP composite
fibers (denoted TPP@PVDF-HFP@commercial separator) and subjected to the ignition experiments
(Figure 3a-b). These separators/fiber networks were wetted by liquid electrolyte of 1 M lithium
hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) in the mixture of EC and DMC (v/v = 1:1), which is the real LIB
electrolyte for a pouch cell and then subjected to an ignition. When heated to 180 oC, the PVDF-HFP
fibers was broken and TPP would be released. Therefore, when wetted by EC/DMC electrolyte, the
flame retardant (TPP) immediately dissolved into electrolyte, converting the flammable electrolyte
into a nonflammable liquid. As can be seen from Figure 3b, both TPP@PVDF-HFP and

TPP@PVDF-HFP@commercial separator could not be ignited by a lighter, even for several times
(Figure 3b1-b2). However, a direct flame could be observed for the commercial separators (two
types) with the same electrolyte (Figure 3b3-b4). The full process of ignition experiments for the
above four types of fibrous materials can be found in movie S1-S4, respectively. Apparently, coaxial
electrospun core-shell fibers with flame retardants contained inside could greatly improve the
battery safety and suppress the combustion.
The effects of the TPP@PVDF-HFP (30 µm) and TPP@PVDF-HFP@commercial separator (35
µm) on the electrochemical performances of LIBs when used as battery separators were examined in
the following section. Figure 4a displays the specific discharge capacity as a function of the cycle
number in LiFePO4 cells at 0.5 C. While the cell with TPP@PVDF-HFP as separator exhibited higher
specific capacity than that of TPP@PVDF-HFP@commercial separator, both the cells showed good
electrochemical cycling stability during the repeating charge and discharge. In addition, both cells
could deliver a stable capacity of more than 120 mAh/g on average for over 100 cycles, which is
comparable to LiFePO4 cells with normal separators [35]. This good cycling behavior further
confirmed that the flame retardants (TPP) was encapsulated inside the PVDF-HFP shell, otherwise
the cycling performance would be greatly negatively affected. Cells with these two separators were
further subjected to a C-rate test to investigate the rate capability (Figure 4b). Both cells exhibited
good rate capabilities, indicating the introduction of the encapsulated TPP has little negative effects
on the rate capability. Moreover, with the increase of discharge rate, the Coloumbic efficiency of
each cycle gradually declined when using TPP@PVDF-HFP as separator (Figure 4c).

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have fabricated an electrospun fibrous material which could either be directly
adopted as flame-retardant separator or be coated on a commercial separator for LIBs. This
electrospun nanofiber network has a thermal-triggered flame-retardant property for LIBs such that
in case of a battery thermal-runaway, it will release its flame-retardant core component out and
suppress the combustion of the organic electrolyte. Unlike the previous methods to fabricate the
flame retardants containing fibers based on single-nozzle electrospinning from a single precursor
solution, our proposed approach involves dual-nozzle coaxial electrospinning out of two different
precursor solutions, with one for polymer shell and the other for flame retardants. As a result, the
concentration of the flame retardants in the precursor solution is independent of the polymer
solution and can be tuned to a relatively high level. The as-prepared core-shell fibers contain a large
quantity, more than 60 wt.% of flame retardants out of the entire composite fiber, which is a
significant improvement compared with previous versions. Since the nonflammability of the
electrolyte would increase drastically with the increasing flame retardants weight ratio, our
developed electrospun fibers with more than 60 wt.% enable excellent flame-retarding property. In
addition, during normal battery cycling, the outer protective shell confined flame retardants inside
and prevent the exposure and dissolution of flame retardants into liquid electrolyte, which
otherwise would have negative influence on battery performances. Therefore, when used as battery
separators, our developed coaxial electrospun core-shell fibers reduce risks of safety hazards
without compromising the battery performance.
