Recent theoretical work indicates that the neutrino radiation in core-collapse supernovae may
be susceptible to flavor instabilities that set in far behind the shock, grow extremely rapidly, and
have the potential to profoundly affect supernova dynamics and composition. Here we analyze the
nonlinear collective oscillations that are prefigured by these instabilities. We demonstrate that a
zero-crossing in nνe − nν̄e as a function of propagation angle is not sufficient to generate instability.
Our analysis accounts for this fact and allows us to formulate complementary criteria. Using Fornax
simulation data, we show that fast collective oscillations qualitatively depend on how forward-peaked
the neutrino angular distributions are.

In this paper we address a key aspect of neutrino
physics in core-collapse supernovae. The stakes are high,
as supernova explosions are central to our understanding
of the origin of elements and the history of galaxies.
Recently it has been realized that the neutrino flavor
field in core-collapse supernovae is prone to a host of instabilities [1–11] that were artificially concealed by the
symmetries adopted in older studies [12–18]. Of particular urgency is the subclass known as fast instabilities, so
named because they exhibit growth
√ rates proportional to
the self-coupling potential µ = 2GF nν and are not suppressed by the typically much smaller vacuum oscillation
frequency ω = δm2 /2E [19–34]. They are commonly, if
not always, associated with zero-crossings of the electron
lepton number carried by neutrinos (νELN) as a function of propagation angle. Global variations in nν̄e /nνe —
possibly related to LESA (lepton-number emission selfsustained asymmetry) [35–41]—and coherent neutrino–
nucleus scattering [42] independently make this condition
a live possibility in core-collapse supernovae [42–47]. If
fast flavor conversion (FFC) does occur, it could substantially alter our current view of supernova dynamics and
nucleosynthesis [48, 49].
The aim of the present study is to gain some degree
of understanding of the nonlinear collective effects heralded by fast flavor instabilities. Our basic approach
is to study the evolution of the neutrino flavor field in
terms of its momentum-space angular moments. Three
considerations motivate this choice. The first is realism: Neutrino angular distributions within ∼ 100 km
are quite unlike the forms they are given in bulb or beam
models. In point of fact, they transition—very gradually relative to the µ−1 scale—from nearly isotropic to
narrowly forward-peaked [50–53]. The second consideration is computational: As it is, many state-of-the-art
supernova simulations only track the first few angular
moments, and cohesion between hydrodynamic and oscillation calculations is clearly desirable [54–61]. The last
is theoretical: In multipole space, the factor (1 − p̂ · q̂)
that couples neutrinos of momenta p and q becomes a

sum of monopole and dipole couplings [62, 63]. Angular
moments are consequently a natural lens through which
to examine collective oscillations.
This last observation is especially true of fast modes,
which can be isolated by taking µ  ω. Because neutrino
energy drops out of the coherent evolution, we can work
with polarization vectors that are integrated over the
spectrum. Neutrinos propagating in a homogeneous environment at angle v = cos θ (axial symmetry is assumed
throughout) then obey the hybrid multipole/momentum
equation
Ṗv = µ (D0 − vD1 ) × Pv .

(1)

Here D0 and D1 are the monopole and dipole difference √
vectors (Dl = Pl − P̄l ) and the matter potential
λ = 2GF ne has been rotated out. It is immediately
apparent that the only way for the flavor content Pv,z to
change significantly on a fast time scale is for D0 − vD1
to swing away from the flavor axis.
In terms of the difference vectors and their counterpart
sum vectors Sl = Pl + P̄l , the multipole equations of
motion are [62]

where al = 2l/(2l + 1) and bl = 2(l + 1)/(2l + 1). D0 is
constant on µ−1 time scales, implying that fast collective
modes must be driven by D1 . It is helpful at this point to
switch to a frame rotating about D̂0 at frequency µD0 ,
where D0 = |D0 |. Using primes to denote vectors in the
rotating frame and introducing L0 = (D00 + 2D02 )/3 and
G0 = 2D03 /5, we then have
Ḋ01 = µL0 × D01 ,
3
Ḋ02 = µG0 × D01 .

Computing D01 × D̈01 leads to a pendulum equation, which
can be written in a form comparable to that of the bipolar
pendulum (Eq. 39 of Ref. [13]) by defining δ 0 = D01 /D1

distinguished by the use of darker shades: purple for cos θv ,

and Sigl [62] showed that the dipole term is the driving
force behind kinematic decoherence. This remains true
on short time scales, and it is clear from Eq. (1) that
D1 causes dephasing of neutrinos with different values of
v. But the constraints on the motion of D1 mean that
the dephasing can give rise to persistent collective oscillations rather than effectively irreversible relaxation,
at least until the effects of finite ω become important.
The additional fact that some of these constraints involve
only the first four angular moments gives us some hope
of capturing the important features of FFC without having fine-grained information about the distributions in
momentum space. Indeed, the higher conservation laws,
which encode the fact that all angular moments are dynamically linked, may have utility for closing the moment
hierarchy in a sensible way.
We can be more specific about the connection to kinematic decoherence by recalling that S0 obeys a pendulum
equation as well [13, 62, 68, 69], with energy
ES = ωB · S0 +


µ
D20 − D21 .

Kinematic decoherence arises because D20 and D21 are
able to evolve at the cost of S0 shrinking [62]. But if
µ  ω, then the S0 pendulum generally has very little
sway over the D1 pendulum. The opposite is not true,
however: D1 steers the evolution of S0 . Relaxation occurs through the mutual interaction of the two pendula;
the fact that the influence is one-way in the ω → 0 limit
enables sustained collective motion.
It remains for us to understand how the predilection
of D01 for pendulum motion is expressed through the individual polarization vectors. Ultimately our interest is
in the projection onto the flavor axis:
Ṗv,z = −µv (D1 × Pv )z .

and σ = δ 0 · L0 . The result is
δ 0 × δ̈ 0
+ σ δ̇ 0 = µD1 G0 × δ 0 .

One critical distinction with respect to the bipolar pendulum is that in this case “gravity” is not a fixed external
potential. In fact, G0 couples directly to D01 , making this
a sort of nonlinear gyroscopic pendulum. Nevertheless,
the possibility for collective pendulum motion is built
into the structure of Eq. (2). Numerical realizations of it
are shown in Figs. 1 and 2.
The dynamics of the system is also restricted by a
tower of conservation laws, which can be constructed by
differentiating D01 · D0l and recursively reducing the righthand side until it is expressed as a total derivative. The
first three conserved quantities are D1 , σ, and

Writing the vectors in terms of their angular coordinates

θ1 and φ1 being the same of D1 ), Eq. (7) becomes
θ̇v = µvD1 sin θ1 sin (φv − φ1 ) .

Suppose that Pv (0) ∝ z. If the phase difference develops
slowly enough that the right-hand side of Eq. (8) is positive over many cycles of φ1 , then θv can grow to a size
unsuppressed by the vacuum mixing angle.
As the instability grows, Eq. (9) breaks down and is
replaced by the collective motion seen in Fig. 1. Pv,z dips
in proportion to v sin(φv − φ1 ) and is reflected in—and
driven by—peaks in D1,z (which are imperceptibly small

two qualitatively different outcomes as a function of v.

with Rl = Dl,z (0)/D0,z (0). The quantity ṽ serves as a
control parameter that shapes the v-dependence of the
collective oscillations. When ṽ is comfortably inside the
range [−1, 1] (as in the test cases at r = 33 km), it indicates the presence of narrow resonances. When ṽ ≈ ±1
(as at r = 70 km), the resonances fuse. Going one step
further, we can use this parameter as the basis for a simple stability criterion: If |ṽ| > 1, FFC cannot occur.
Conducting a linear stability analysis in terms of angular moments is revealing as well. Following the usual
procedure [70], we take the flavor coherence to be of the
collective form SE,v = QE,v exp(−iΩt) and search for
growing solutions (Im Ω > 0) to the dispersion relation

We continue to set λ = ω = 0, and we assume that
nνx = nν̄x . In these expressions Ll is the lth Legendre
polynomial and Rl is the ratio of the lth Legendre moment of the νELN to the total νELN (i.e., Rl is the same
parameter that appears in Eq. (10)):

As the pendulum analysis suggests, it is possible to have
instability with nνe = nν̄e , but for the convenience of
working with dimensionless ratios whose meanings are
fairly transparent, we assume that the √
number densities
are not extremely close in value. Since 2GF (nνe − nν̄e )
only serves to set the time scale, stability is entirely controlled by the parameters Rl≥1 .
One virtue of assessing stability in terms of angular
moments is that any Ij,l (or the equivalent when ω 6= 0)

indicates parameters for which no zero-crossing occurs in the electron lepton number carried by neutrinos; and the magenta,
cyan, and red curves border the unstable regions according to Eqs. (10), (15), and (16), respectively. Arrows point into the
unstable regions. For reference, the Fig. 1 angular distributions at 33 km have R1 = −0.35 (−1.11), R2 = −0.02 (−0.05),
and R3 = 0 (0) for α = 0.97 (0.99). The angular distributions at 70 km have R1 = −0.17 (−0.87), R2 = −0.24 (−0.71), and
R3 = −0.12 (−0.34) for α = 0.90 (0.95).

can be evaluated analytically, thereby preserving the singularity structure. The singular feature in this case is a
branch cut along the real axis of the complex-Ω plane; it
spans the values for which the integrand of Ij,l diverges
for some v ∈ [−1, 1]. By retaining the logarithms in
Eq. (11), one avoids the unwelcome appearance of spurious instabilities [71]. We suspect that this advantage
carries over to nonlinear calculations that directly evolve
the angular moments.
As for what the stability analysis reveals, we find that
it qualitatively bears out the D1 pendulum dynamics.
The primary features of Fig. 3, which presents the regions
of instability in three different ways, are all accounted for
by Eqs. (4) and (5). In brief, the main takeaway is that
the system is destabilized if the l = 2 moment of the
νELN has the opposite sign to the l = 0 moment (because the spin σ is thereby diminished, up to a point)
or if the l = 3 moment has the same sign as the l = 0
moment (because then G0 (0) · δ 0 (0) > 0 and the pendulum is initially inverted). The liminal case R2 = 0 in
the leftmost color map is also necessarily stable, because
D3 never becomes nonzero: no gravity, no instability.
A related observation can be made about the numerical
solution of the nonlinear equations, where we have confirmed that FFC occurs when the system is truncated at
l = 3 but disappears when the system is truncated at
l = 2.
While a νELN crossing is commonly believed to be a
necessary condition for FFC [21, 23, 24, 28], Fig. 3 shows
that it is not a sufficient one. An alternative estimate of
the unstable region can be obtained by supposing that
D3 is constant. Using conservation of energy and conservation of angular momentum along D3 , we can solve for
the southernmost deviation θ1,max reached by an initially

inverted pendulum [13]:

Solutions disappear in the stable region of parameter
space. In terms of νELN ratios, the system is unstable if

(15)
72
In Fig. 3 we compare Eq. (15) to the exact results from
linear stability analysis and to the |ṽ| ≤ 1 criterion
[Eq. (10)].
A different stability test was recently proposed in
Ref. [25], one which (like ṽ) involves only the l ≤ 2 νELN
angular moments. To make contact with that work, we
now allow for spatially inhomogeneous collective modes:
SE,v = QE,v exp(−iΩt + iKr). In the linear regime, the
only change to the foregoing results is that a term −Kv
is added to the denominator
of Ij,l . A central insight of
√
Ref. [25] is that K = 2GF (nνe − nν̄e )R1 cancels the
other term proportional to v, turning a transcendental
dispersion relation into a quadratic equation. In our notation, they find the instability criterion
R1 R3 ≥

2

(2 + R2 )
.
(16)
9
We plot this result in Fig. 3 as well, bearing in mind that
it is being compared to the K = 0 mode. The comparison should therefore be interpreted with suitable caution.
In our view, all of these criteria are complementary, and
they are bound to have more or less diagnostic power
depending on factors such as the neutrino angular distributions and the spectrum of inhomogeneities.
Continuing in the same vein, we now show that spatially growing, steady-state fast modes have pendulumlike behavior built into their equations of motion as well.

where v 6= 0 and the overdot now denotes a spatial derivative. (Homogeneity along the transverse directions requires that v = 0 trajectories exhibit no flavor transformation.) It is again possible to rotate out λ—and we
have done so—provided that we work in the nearly homogeneous limit. More precisely, we ignore small-scale
fluctuations and assume that the scale heights of λ and µ
are much greater than any fast oscillation length, so that
the two parameters are approximately constant over the
region we consider.

To make sure the integrals converge, we interpret them
as denoting their principal values, or equivalently assert
that Pv = 0 at v = 0. We presume that the collective
modes of the system are not particularly sensitive to the
flavor distribution of neutrinos traveling precisely transverse to the symmetry axis. From the orthogonality and
recursion relations of Legendre polynomials, it follows
that

The product in both cases is from n = 1 up to n =
(|l − l0 | − 1)/2 and is equal to 1 if |l − l0 | = 1.
An immediate consequence of Eqs. (18) and (20) is
that D1 is constant. It is therefore possible to shift to a
rotating frame in which the −µD1 × Dl terms drop out.
Letting primes denote the new frame, we introduce (or,

δ0 =

D0

σ = δ 0 · L0 ,

(21)

Calculating δ 0 × δ̈ 0 , we find ourselves back at Eq. (4),
but with D1 replaced by D0 . Once again the pendulum’s
length, spin, and mechanical energy (given by Eq. (5)
after sending D01 → D00 ) are all conserved. Besides
this replacement, there is another fundamental difference between the temporal and spatial flavor development: Eq. (20) tells us that L0 is a superposition of all
odd moments, whereas G0 is a superposition of all even
moments. Inhomogeneity brings a host of complications
with it, and so we leave for future work the task of exploring numerically how the pendulum-like tendency manifests in spatially evolving collective modes.
The aim of this study has been to extract analytic insights into FFC from the nonlinear equations of motion.
The central finding is that the angular-moment equations
exhibit a certain pendulum-like structure in the two limits which are most analytically tractable (viz., when the
neutrino density is high, the matter background is homogeneous, and the neutrino flavor field is either homogeneous or stationary). In general, of course, a flavor field
develops both spatially and temporally. More work must
be done to understand what our finding implies for the
full PDE problem.
The analysis presented here opens new paths toward
understanding collective oscillations and incorporating
their effects into frontline supernova simulations.
