ON THE EXISTENCE OF AN EXTREMAL FUNCTION
IN THE DELSARTE EXTREMAL PROBLEM
MARCELL GAAÃÅL AND ZSUZSANNA NAGY-CSIHA

Abstract. This paper is concerned with a Delsarte type extremal
problem. Denote by P(G) the set of positive definite continuous
functions on a locally compact abelian group G. We consider the
function class, which was originally introduced by Gorbachev,

G(W, Q)G = f ‚àà P(G) ‚à© L1 (G) :
o
f (0) = 1, supp f+ ‚äÜ W, supp fb ‚äÜ Q

where W ‚äÜ G is closed and of finite Haar measure and Q ‚äÜ G
compact. We also consider the related Delsarte type problem of
finding the extremal quantity

The main objective of the current paper is to prove the existence
of an extremal function for the Delsarte type extremal problem
D(W, Q)G . The existence of the extremal function has recently
been established by Berdysheva and ReÃÅveÃÅsz in the most immediate
case where G = Rd . So the novelty here is that we consider the
problem in the general setting of locally compact abelian groups.
In this way our result provides a far reaching generalization of the
former work of Berdysheva and ReÃÅveÃÅsz.

provided that (i) f ‚àà L1 (Rd ), f is continuous and bounded on Rd , (ii)
f (0) = 1, (iii) f (x) ‚â§ 0 for kxk ‚â• 2 and (iv) fb(y) ‚â• 0. The last
property (iv) can be interpreted as f being positive definite, see the
precise definition of positive definiteness in the forthcoming section.
The Delsarte extremal problem has generated broad interest because
of its intimate connections to different problems from various branches
of mathematics. First of all, the linear programming bound of Delsarte
is useful in coding and design theory as well. Second, let us mention
that relying on Delsarte‚Äôs problem, upper bounds can be derived for
the sphere packing density of Rd [2, 8, 17, 22]. Moreover, Gorbachev
and Tikhonov [10] worked out a further concrete application of the
Delsarte problem for the so-called Wiener problem.
A few of years ago Viazovska [21] solved the sphere packing problem
in dimension 8, combining the Delsarte extremal problem with modular
form techniques. Subsequently, in the paper [4] Cohn et al. resolved
the problem also in dimension 24.
Beside solving the Delsarte problem, further challenging and closely
related questions come into picture. As for recent investigations in this
direction, we refer to the seminal paper of Berdysheva and ReÃÅveÃÅsz [1].
They have pointed out the independence of the extremal constant from
the underlying function class. Furthermore, they showed the existence
of an extremal function in band-limited cases. The main objective
of the current paper is to prove an analogous result for general LCA
groups.
2. The result
Before moving on, we need some more preliminaries. In the first part
of the section, we summarize the necessary background from the field of
abstract harmonic analysis. Let G be a locally compact abelian group
b by which
(LCA group for short). The dual group of G is denoted by G,
we mean the set of continuous homomorphisms of G into the complex
unit circle T, the multiplication being the pointwise multiplication of
functions. For a compact set K ‚äÜ G and an open set U ‚äÜ T, consider
the set
b : œá(K) ‚äÜ U}.
P (K, U) := {œá ‚àà G

b contains the sets P (K, U) as a
Then the compact open topology on G
b acquires an LCA group structure. The
subbasis. By this topology, G
Pontryagin-van Kampen Duality Theorem asserts that G is isomorphic
bb
to G,
both as groups and as topological spaces. In this case Œ¥ stands

3

for the corresponding natural isomorphism, that is
Œ¥g (œá) := œá(g),

b
œá‚ààG

bb
and Œ¥ : G ‚Üí G,
g 7‚Üí Œ¥g which is usually called the Pontryagin map.
Recall that a continuous function f ‚àà C(G) is called positive definite
(denoted by f ‚â´ 0) if the inequality
n

cj ck f (gj ‚àí gk ) ‚â• 0

j=1 k=1

holds for all choices of n ‚àà N, cj ‚àà C and gj ‚àà G for j = 1, . . . , n.
Throughout the paper the set of continuous positive definite functions
defined on G will be denoted by P(G). If ŒªG is a (fixed, conveniently
normalized) Haar measure on G, then the condition (1) for continuous
f is equivalent to

for every œï ‚àà L1 (G) (see, for instance [6, 13.4.4. Proposition]). The
next properties will be quite useful in the sequel. We have [12, (32.4)]

b) G f dŒªG ‚â• 0.

the Inversion Theorem can be rephrased as f = F ‚àó fb is satisfied for

in the most immediate case where G = Rd ,

W = B = {x ‚àà Rd : kxk ‚â§ 1}
and Q = rB with some real number r > 0.
In the very recent publication [1], Berdysheva and ReÃÅveÃÅsz analysed
in details the aforementioned Delsarte type extremal quantity. When
G = Rd , they collect and work up extensive information, which were in
part either folklore or just available in different unpublished sources, to
clarify existence of extremal functions f ‚àà G(W, Q)Rd in certain bandlimited cases, that is, when W is closed and of finite Lebesgue measure
and Q is compact. Since the problem of existence of the extremal
function makes sense also in case of general LCA groups, our objective
is to obtain a completely analogous counterpart of the aforementioned
result in the general setting of LCA groups. More precisely, we intend
to prove the following.
Theorem 2. Let G be any LCA group. If W ‚äÜ G is closed with
b is compact, then there exists
positive, finite Haar measure and Q ‚äÜ G
R
an extremal function f ‚àà G(W, Q)G satisfying G f dŒªG = D(W, Q)G .

Note that the existence of an extremal function might be helpful in
calculating or estimating the extremal constant itself. That explains

5

the effort undertaken, for instance in [1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15] to
prove existence of extremal functions. As we will see, the argument of
[1] cannot be directly copied here, because the estimation of modulus
of smoothness, direct use and decrease estimates of Bessel functions,
or œÉ-compactness of the underlying group G are no longer available.
3. Proof
Recall that a Banach space X is called weakly compactly generated
(WCG for short) if it has a weakly compact subset whose linear span
is dense in X. Fundamental examples of such spaces are separable
normed spaces and reflexive Banach spaces.
An important property what we shall apply in our argument is that
the unit ball of the dual space of a WCG space is weak-‚àó sequentially
compact (see [5], page 148).
For a general LCA group G, it might be difficult to characterize
when L1 (G) turns to be a WCG space, however, a sufficient condition
for that is the œÉ-compactness of G. This sufficiency can be seen by
composing two well-known results. First note that the space L1 (X, ¬µ)
is WCG when the occurring measure ¬µ is œÉ-finite on X (see [18], page
36). Second the Haar measure on the LCA group G is œÉ-finite exactly
when G is œÉ-compact. Moreover, in that case we have the duality
‚àó
(L1 (G)) = L‚àû (G) of Banach spaces (see [13, (20.20.) Theorem] and
cf. [20], page 11) because a œÉ-finite measure is decomposable.
The proof of Theorem 2 rests heavily on a technical lemma.
Lemma 3. Let W ‚äÜ G be closed and of finite Haar measure and let
b be compact. Then the function class G(W, Q)G ‚äÜ C(G) is
Q ‚äÜ G
relatively compact in the compact convergence topology.

In the setting G = Rd the above lemma has been a part of the
proof of [1, Proposition 3.5], and its proof is based on the ArzelaÃÅAscoli Theorem and on the estimation of the modulus of continuity.
We are unable to carry out this argument in the general case of LCA
groups. Thus, we will prove the LCA group counterpart in a slightly
different way, involving some basic notions and properties from the
theory of topological vector spaces, which are given in the forthcoming
paragraphs.
Let A ‚äÜ X be any subset of a locally convex (Hausdorff) topological
vector space X. Then A is called totally bounded, whenever for every
neighbourhood V of the origin, there is a finite subset S ‚äÜ A such that
A is contained in S+V . Obviously, this requirement can be equivalently
assumed only for neighbourhoods belonging to a given neighbourhood
base of X.

6

MARCELL GAAÃÅL AND ZSUZSANNA NAGY-CSIHA

A topological vector space X is called complete if every Cauchy net
has a limit in X. Further for any locally convex topological space
e j) of a
X, there is a unique (up to a linear homeomorphism) pair (X,
e and a linear homeomorphic embedding j : X ‚Üí X
e
complete space X
e
such that j(X) is dense in X.
If G is an LCA group, then the relative compactness can be verified
by using the following result from the theory of locally convex spaces
(see, for instance [16, 3.5.1. Theorem]).
Lemma 4. For every subset E of a locally convex topological vector
space X, the following are equivalent.
1) E is totally bounded.
2) E is relatively compact in the completion of X.
3) Every sequence of E has a cluster point in the completion of X.
Proof of Lemma 3. According to Lemma 4 we are going to show that
G(W, Q)G is totally bounded. First note that in the space C(G)
(equipped with the compact convergence topology) for any compact
set K ‚äÜ G and any Œµ > 0, the U(f ; K, Œµ)-neighbourhood of the function f ‚àà C(G) is defined as
U(f ; K, Œµ) = {h ‚àà C(G) : kh ‚àí f kC(K) < Œµ}.
This forms the defining neighbourhood base for compact convergence
on C(G).
So our aim is to show that for any Œµ > 0 and any compact set K ‚äÜ G,
there exists a finite set {f1 , . . . , fn } ‚äÜ G(W, Q)G such that
G(W, Q)G ‚äÜ

n

U(fj ; K, Œµ).

b is compact in the compact convergence
As by assumption Q ‚äÜ G
topology, Q is totally bounded as well. It means that there exists a
finite set {œá1 , . . . , œán } ‚äÜ Q such that for every Œ≥ ‚àà Q we get that
kŒ≥ ‚àí œáj kC(K) < Œµ for some j ‚àà {1, . . . , n}. Via the disjointization
procedure
Q1 := U(œá1 ; K, Œµ) ‚à© Q
Q2 := U(œá2 ; K, Œµ) ‚à© (Q \ Q1 )
..
.
Qn := U(œán ; K, Œµ) ‚à© (Q \ (Q1 ‚à™ . . . ‚à™ Qn‚àí1 ))

7

we obtain a partition {Q1 , . . . , Qn } of Q such that every Qj (j =
1, . . . , n) is a Borel sets with compact closure, and for any Œ≥ ‚àà Qj
we have kŒ≥ ‚àí œáj kC(K) < Œµ.
Next choose an element f ‚àà G(W, Q)G and define

form U (0; K, 2Œµ). Therefore, we found a finite net (4) such that the
respective translates of U (0; K, 2Œµ) cover G(W, Q)G , so the function set
G(W, Q)G is totally bounded.

In the sequel we make crucial use of the following selection lemma.

Lemma 5. Suppose that G is œÉ-compact. Let (fn ) be a sequence in
G(W, Q)G . Then there exists a subsequence of (fn ) which converges to
a function f ‚àà G(W, Q)G uniformly on every compact set and also in
the weak-‚àó sense. Moreover, we have the inequality

Proof of Lemma 5. In the first part of the proof, we use the arguments
given in [1]. Let (fn ) be a sequence in G(W, Q)G . Using Lemmata 3, 4
and the completeness of C(G) with respect to the compact convergence
topology, we conclude that there exists a subsequence of (fn ) which
tends to some f ‚àà C(G) uniformly on every compact set, and thus
also in the pointwise sense. Without loss of generality we may and do
assume that (fn ) itself converges to f .
Next we intend to show that f ‚àà G(W, Q)G . Since the pointwise limit
of positive definite functions is likewise positive definite, it follows that
f ‚â´ 0 holds. As W ‚äÜ G is closed, we clearly have supp f+ ‚äÜ W = W ,
f (0) = 1 and |f | ‚â§ 1.
Now we are concerned with verifying that f belongs to L1 (G). Writing f = f+ ‚àí f‚àí and, in a similar fashion, fn = (fn )+ ‚àí (fn )‚àí one has
(fn )¬± ‚Üí f¬± in the pointwise sense. An application of Fatou‚Äôs lemma
gives us that

proved f ‚àà L1 (G), that is, also f ‚àà C(G) ‚à© L1 (G) ‚à© L‚àû (G), whence it
belongs to L2 (G). In particular, fb does exist, is continuous and belongs
b
to L2 (G).
It remains to show that supp fb ‚äÜ Q. Here we need to argue in a
different way than [1] does. Clearly, the linear functional
Z
œàœÅ (œï) :=
œïœÅdŒªG ,
for œï ‚àà L1 (G)
G

belongs to the unit ball in the dual space of L1 (G) for œÅ = fn or œÅ = f .
Using that G is œÉ-compact, we have that the space L1 (G) is WCG,
‚àó
moreover, (L1 (G)) = L‚àû (G). Thus there is a subsequence of (fn )
(supposed to be itself (fn ) again) which converges to some f0 ‚àà L‚àû (G)
in the weak-‚àó sense. It is not difficult to verify that f0 must coincide
with the locally uniform limit function f , that is, we have

Define the functions Œ∏Œ≥ (œá) := (1B ‚ãÜ 1B )(œáŒ≥ ‚àí1 ) and Œ∏(œá) := Œ∏1 (œá). Note
that Œ∏ is compactly supported and Œ∏(1) = (1B ‚ãÜ 1B )(1) = ŒªGb (B).
2
Since B is symmetric, we get F ‚àó (Œ∏) = 1c
B , by elementary properties of the L2 -Fourier transform [19, Section 1.6]. This immediately
yields that F ‚àó (Œ∏) ‚àà L1 (G). Indeed, one has
kF ‚àó (Œ∏)k1 = 1c
B

because B has compact closure and the Haar measure is locally finite.
Thus, we also have

= Œ≥(g) ¬∑ |F ‚àó(1B )(g)|2 = Œ≥(g) ¬∑ 1c
B (Œ¥g )

where the last equality follows from the symmetry of B. We see that
h ‚àà L1 (G). So we can take k := f ‚ãÜ h ‚àà L1 (G) for which we clearly
have F (k) = fbŒ∏Œ≥ .

in particular,
0 = fb(Œ≥)Œ∏Œ≥ (Œ≥) = fb(Œ≥)Œ∏(1) = fb(Œ≥)ŒªGb (B).

Thus, at any point Œ≥ outside the set Q the function fb vanishes. It
follows that supp fb ‚äÜ Q and so f ‚àà G(W, Q)G as wanted.

From the definition it is clear that the restriction of a positive definite
function to a subgroup remains positive definite on the subgroup as
well. For the following fact, the reader can consult with [12, (32.43)
(a)].
Lemma 6. Let H ‚â§ G be a closed subgroup of G. If the function
f : H ‚Üí C is continuous and positive definite, then so is its trivial
extension fe : G ‚Üí C defined by

otherwise.
Now we are in a position to prove Theorem 2. Our strategy is the
following. First we prove the theorem in the case where the underlying
group is œÉ-compact, and then we reduce the general case after some
technical preparation to the œÉ-compact one.
Proof of Theorem 2. At first we suppose that G is œÉ-compact. Using
the definition of sup, there is an extremal sequence (fn ) ‚äÜ G(W, Q)G

such that

According to Lemma 5, there exists a limit function f ‚àà G(W, Q)G such
that a subsequence of (fn ) converges to f . Without loss of generality,
we may and do suppose that (fn ) converges toR f . We show that f
is the extremal function in G(W, Q)G , that is, G f dŒªG = D(W, Q)G .
By using the definition of the extremal constant, inequality (5) and
definition (10), we get
D(W, Q)G ‚â•

and thus we have equality everywhere in the last displayed chain of
inequalities. This completes the proof when G is œÉ-compact.
Assume now that G is not œÉ-compact. Let G0 the open, œÉ-compact
subgroup which is generated by W , that is,
[
V := W ‚àí W,
G0 :=
nV.
n‚ààN

Then G0 is an LCA group and a Haar measure on G0 is given by
ŒªG0 := ŒªG |G0 . Define the sets Q‚àó , Q0 as
n
o
‚àó
c
Q := Œ≥ ‚àà G0 : all the extensions of Œ≥ to G lie in Q
n
o
c0 : ‚àÉœá ‚àà Q such that œá|G0 = Œ≥ .
Q0 := Œ≥ ‚àà G

c0 is compact.
Claim 1. The set Q‚àó ‚äÜ G

Clearly, we have Q‚àó ‚äÜ Q0 . The set Q0 is the image of the compact
set Q under the restriction map
b‚ÜíG
c0 ,
Œ¶:G

œá 7‚Üí œá|G0 .

Since G0 is open, according to [11, (24.5) Lemma] Œ¶ is continuous. So
Q‚àó is compact if and only if it is a closed subset of the compact set Q0 .
We can write the complement of Q‚àó as
c0 : ‚àÉœá ‚àà G,
b œá|G0 = Œæ, œá ‚àà
(Q‚àó )c ={Œæ ‚àà G
/ Q}


[
b\Q
=
{œá|G0 } = Œ¶ G
b
œá‚ààG\Q

where the latter set is open because Œ¶ is an open mapping, again by
[11, (24.5) Lemma].

Similarly to (2) and (3) we consider the function class G(W, Q‚àó )G0
and the extremal quantity D(W, Q‚àó )G0 .
Claim 2. We have h0 ‚àà G(W, Q‚àó )G0 if and only if for its extension h
we have h ‚àà G(W, Q)G .
First assume that h ‚àà G(W, Q)G . Since further properties of h0 :=
h|G0 are inherited to that of h, we intend to show that supp hb0 ‚äÜ Q‚àó .
c0 for which hb0 (Œ≥) 6= 0. Let œá ‚àà G
b be any extension of
Choose a Œ≥ ‚àà G
Œ≥ such that œá|G0 = Œ≥. As h ‚àà L1 (G) with supp h ‚äÜ G0 , there holds the
computation

G

b of Œ≥ lies
whence b
h(œá) 6= 0 holds. It follows that every extension œá ‚àà G
in Q, in other words Œ≥ ‚àà Q‚àó . Thus, supp hb0 ‚äÜ Q‚àó , as wanted.
To see the converse, again from the computation (11) we see that
b
h(œá) 6= 0 implies hb0 (Œ≥) 6= 0 whenever Œ≥ is the restriction of œá. By
assumption and the definition of the set Q‚àó , the character œá lies in Q.
So supp b
h ‚äÜ Q, and thus h ‚àà G(W, Q)G .
Claim 3. We have D(W, Q)G = D(W, Q‚àó )G0 .

The inequality D(W, Q)G ‚â§ D(W, Q‚àó )G0 is in fact easy to verify.
Indeed, by the D(W, Q)G -extremality of the sequence (fn ) and fn0 :=
fn |G0 ‚àà G(W, Q‚àó )G0 for every n ‚àà N, we get

for every n ‚àà N+ , as wanted.
To see the converse, consider an extremal sequence (fn0 ) ‚äÜ
G(W, Q‚àó )G0 on G0 and extend it in the trivial way to a sequence (fen ) on
b
G. Then in virtue of (11) fen (œá) 6= 0 implies fbn0 (Œ≥) 6= 0 where Œ≥ = œá|G0 .
The latter condition gives us that Œ≥ ‚àà Q‚àó , so it follows directly that
b
supp fen ‚äÜ Q. Hence fen ‚àà G(W, Q)G and thus

fn dŒªG =

G0
for every integer n ‚â• 1 which implies D(W, Q)G ‚â• D(W, Q‚àó )G0 .

Now we can finish the proof of Theorem 2 quite easily. To do so,
consider a D(W, Q‚àó )G0 -extremal sequence (fn0 ) on G0 . Then according

13

to Lemma 5 there is a subsequence of (fn0 ) which tends to a function
f0 ‚àà G(W, Q‚àó )G0 , and we have
Z
f0 dŒªG0 = D(W, Q‚àó )G0 = D(W, Q)G .
G0

For the trivial extension fe of f0 , one has
Z
Z
e
f0 dŒªG0 = D(W, Q)G .
f dŒªG =

G0

Since fe ‚àà G(W, Q)G , the last displayed equality shows that the function
fe is D(W, Q)G -extremal.

Remark. It is apparent from the construction presented in the last part
of the proof of Theorem 2 that the extremal function can be chosen to
be supported in the open œÉ-compact subgroup of G generated by W .
