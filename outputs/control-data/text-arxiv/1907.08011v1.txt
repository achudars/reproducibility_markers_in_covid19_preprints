ABSTRACT

We have investigated the possibilities to quantify how much stars move in the Milky
Way stellar disk due to diffuse processes (i.e. so called blurring) and due to influences
from spiral arms and the bar (i.e. so called churning). To this end we assume that it is
possible to infer the formation radius of a star if we know their elemental abundances
and age as well as the metallicity profile of the interstellar medium at the time of
the formation of the star. Using this information, coupled with orbital information
derived from Gaia DR2 data and radial velocities from large spectroscopic surveys,
we show that it is possible to isolate stellar samples such that we can start to quantify
how important the role of churning is. We use data for red giant branch stars from
APOGEE DR14, parallaxes from Gaia and stellar ages based on the C and N elemental
abundances in the stars. In our sample, we find that about half of the stars have
experienced some sort of radial migration (based solely on their orbital properties),
while 10% of the stars likely have suffered only from churning, whilst a modest 57% of stars have never experienced either churning or blurring making them ideal
tracers of the original properties of the cool stellar disk. To arrive at these numbers
we have imposed the requirement that the stars that are considered to be churned
have highly circular orbits. If we instead require the star has moved away from its
formation position and at the same time its Galacto-centric radius at formation that
lays outside of its apo- as well as peri-centre today we find that about half of the stars
have undergone a combination of churning and blurring. Our investigation shows that
it is possible to put up a framework where we can begin to quantify churning and
blurring an important. Important aspects for future work would include to investigate
how selection effects should be accounted for.

INTRODUCTION

It has long been understood that a star moving in the Galactic potential will be subject to transient gravitational interactions, such as passing close to another star or a giant
molecular cloud or interacting with the density enhancement
caused by a spiral arm (e.g., Wielen 1977). Many of these
mechanisms have been studied in quite some detail and have
allowed us to for example understand the structure in velocity space of the stars in the Hipparcos data as the result partially of interactions with spiral arms and the bar
(Dehnen 2000). These interactions generally causes initially
circular orbits to over time become less circular – an effect
now known as “blurring”.
The observation that the Sun is more metal-rich than

the youngest stars in the solar neighbourhood has invoked
the idea that the Sun potentially came from a region interior
to the current position of the sun (Wielen et al. 1996). However, no reasonable set of physical interactions have been
able to explain how the Sun could have undertaken this journey. Sellwood & Binney (2002) showed that another process,
“churning”, can move a star from a more or less circular orbit
to another circular orbit thus erasing all memory of the past
kinematic history of the star – this means that we can not integrate the orbits of stars backwards to figure out where they
came from (an example can be found in Martı́nez-Barbosa
et al. 2016).
Since the seminal paper by Sellwood & Binney (2002)
several studies have shown that the effects of radial migration (churning and blurring combined) can be substantial
(Roškar et al. 2008; Loebman et al. 2011). However, although
there is no doubt that the mechanisms resulting in churn-

Sofia Feltzing et al.

ing and blurring are present a proper quantification of their
respective importance in the Milky Way stellar disk is still
lacking. This is partially due to a lack of a large enough
and reliable enough data-set but also partially due to that
we are still exploring efficient ways to study these effects.
Frankel et al. (2018) provides a model that aims to quantify
the global efficiency of radial migration amongst stars in the
Milky Way. Using data from APOGEE DR12 (Alam et al.
2015) they find that with a radial orbit migration efficiency
of 3.6±0.1 kpc. In this model the sun might have a formation
radius of about 5.2 kpc. A quite substantial distance away
from its present position.
In this study we explore a possible way to quantify the
fraction of stars that have migrated radially in the Galaxy.
We also attempt to derive the fractions of stars that have
been blurred and churned, respectively. Our method borrows
ideas from Minchev et al. (2018) and Grenon (1987) and is
quite simple. What we do is to assume that there exists a
model that describes how the radial metallicity gradient in
the inter-stellar medium (ISM) in the Milky Way has evolved
over time. Then if we know the age and the metallicity of a
star it is straightforward to derive the Galacto-centric radius
at which the star formed. This then allows us to calculate
how far the star has moved radially in our Galaxy from
when it formed till today. Combining such information with
orbital data allows to further study how stars with different
kinematic properties have moved – enabling us to put up a
method to constrain both churning as well as blurring.
In this way we are able to identify the individual stars
that have migrated and can, for example study the properties of blurred stars and contrast that with the properties of
the churned stars. This allows, eventually, for a fine-grained
understanding of the underlying stellar populations. It also
allows a study of the properties of stars that have not moved
from where they formed, providing further constraints on
our understanding of how the stellar disk in the Milky Way
formed.
This paper is organised as follows: Sect. 2 describes the
data-set used in this exploratory study; Sect. 3 explains the
method and describe the different sets of ISM profiles we
use; in Sect. 4 we derive upper limits on how many stars
have radially migrated and how many have been churned or
blurred in our sample. We also discuss limitations of the sample (selection effects) and take a look at how cosmological
simulations could potentially be used to provide the evolution of the ISM; Sect. 4.5 provides a summarising discussion
of our results; Sect. 5 concludes the paper with a summary
of our findings.

DATA

2.1

APOGEE and Gaia data

We use data from APOGEE (SDSS-IV data release 14, Majewski et al. 2017) and Gaia data release 2 (DR2, Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016, 2018a). From APOGEE DR14 we
select all stars that fullfil the following four criteria
(i) They are part of the main survey targets
(ii) There were no failures in determining

• the surface gravity (log g)
• the rotation
• the overall iron abundance ([Fe/H]1 )
(iii) Radial velocity could be determined for the star and
the error in the radial velocity is < 0.5 km s−1
(iv) The uncertainty in the determination of [Fe/H] is <
0.05 dex
Criterium (iii) ensures that we exclude potential binaries from the sample. The selected stars from APOGEE
DR14 were cross-matched with Gaia DR2. We further require that the relative uncertainty in the parallax measured
by Gaia t is less than 10 %. This cut allows us to do robust and straightforward calculations of the stellar orbits
(compare, e.g., discussion in Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018b,
about selecting the best stars for studying fine-structure in
the observed Herzsprung-Russel diagram).
The combined sample drawn from APOGEE DR14 and
Gaia DR2 fulfilling the criteria listed above amount to about
85 000 stars. Figure 1 shows [Mg/Fe] as a function of [Fe/H]
for the sample.
2.2

Calculations of stellar orbits

Using the astrometric data from Gaia DR2 and radial velocities from APOGEE DR14 we used galpy2 (Bovy 2015)
to calculate velocities and orbital parameters for the stars.
In parti such as the eccentricity of the orbit (ecc.).
Following Liu & van de Ven (2012) we also derive Lz /Lc
for a more robust estimate of the circularity of the orbits.
Here Lz is the angular momentum in the ẑ-direction (in cylindrical coordinates) while Lc is the angular momentum in the
ẑ-direction the star would have were it on a circular orbit
characterised by the same energy as the current orbit. Thus
Lc = Rc vc

(1)

We use the standard notation where [X/H] = log(NX /NH )star −
log(NX /NH ) ), X being any element.

where Rc follows from solving
E = Φ + vc2 /2

(2)

where E is the orbital energy and vc is the circular velocity
defined as vc2 = R∂Φ/∂R for z = 0.
The resulting distribution of Lz /Lc are shown in Fig. 2
d). Figure B1 shows a comparison of ecc. and Lz /Lc for all
stars in our sample. Overall the two measures correlate well,
but there are deviations. Following Liu & van de Ven (2012)
we use the Lz /Lc for the majority of our investigations, however, we apply a stricter definition of orbital circularity than
they do (see Sect. 3.4).

2.3

Stellar ages

We need stellar ages for our investigation. However, our stellar sample consists entirely of giant stars (most of them being on or near the red clump) and determining ages is difficult for such stars. We make use of the investigation by
Martig et al. (2016) who used carbon and nitrogen to infer
the mass of the stars and hence provide the possibility to
place the star on the right track in the HR-diagram and derive its age. These ages are good to about 40 %, this means
that we can not study ages of individual stars but the ensemble properties should be relatively robust.

2.4

Properties of the full sample

The final sample drawn from APOGEE DR14, Gaia DR2
(Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018a), and Martig et al. (2016)
with stellar orbits calculated using galpy comprises some
18 000 stars. In this section we describe the overall characteristics of the sample as well as validate that the ages
provide a reasonable description of the stars in the stellar
disk.
Figure 2 show the major characteristics of our sample.
Figures 2 a) to d) show how the full sample covers Galactocentric distances from about 6 to 11 kpc and how their
Galacto-centric distances relate to their other properties.
The stars reach maximum distances above the plane (zmax )
of several kpc, but the majority do not reach beyond 1.5 kpc.
Metallicities range between –0.5 dex to super-solar and their
distribution in Galacto-centric distances does not depend on
metallicity. Stellar ages ranges from 0.5 to about 10 Gyr. The
over-density of stars beyond the solar orbit have ages in the
younger range whilst stars inside the solar orbit have somewhat larger ages. We will come back to these observations.
Figure 3 provides a simple validation of the stellar ages.
The stars have been divided in to high- and low-α stars,
as indicated in Fig. 1. Figure 3 then shows the sample divided into the high- and low-α stars for four different ranges
of zmax . For each sample we also show the distributions of
stellar ages for the high- and low-α stars. We find that the
sample of high-[Mg/Fe] stars on average are older than the
low-[Mg/Fe] stars for the sub-sample closest to the plane
(plots in the top row). This is expected from solar neighbourhood studies of dwarf stars (e.g., Bensby et al. 2014;
Fuhrmann et al. 2017) and thus confirms that our sample in
all likelihood gives a reasonable description of the properties
of Milky Way disk stars. The overall age of the low-α stars
MNRAS 000, 1–15 (0000)

changes as a function of height above the Galactic plane
such that the stars get older as we move to higher heights.
The high-α stars, in contrast, has roughly the same median
age and similar age spread at all zmax . Thus resulting in an
overall age-gradient for the whole sample as we move away
from the plane. This is an expected behaviour.
These simple considerations serve as a validation that
our ages give a reasonable representation of the stellar populations and we can use them with confidence in our investigation.
We note that that although the high-α stars are subdominant at low zmax as expect, the relative number of lowα stars remains high also at large zmax . At 1 kpc there are
still more low-α stars than high-α stars. The difference is
not very large and could be due to selection effects.
It is important to note that the method we use to infer
formation radii for stars should only be applied to stars that
are likely to have formed in a disc-like structure. It is very
likely that so called high-α or thick disk stars have formed at
a time when the interstellar medium was highly turbulent
and/or in-homogenous (e.g., Bournaud et al. 2009). Only
later did the interstellar medium settle enough to allow for
disc formation (Kassin et al. 2012) where it is meaningful to
study the effects of churning and blurring (compare Frankel
et al. 2018). Figure 2 e) to h) show the properties of the
sample when we restrict it to stars in the low-α trend as
defined in Fig. 1 and with zmax < 0.5 kpc.

ANALYSIS

Formation radii were derived in the same way as in Minchev
et al. (2018) by assuming a model that describe how the
radial metallicity gradient of the ISM changes over time
and then simply referring each star to the relevant Galactocentric distance given its [Fe/H] and age. The difference between their work and ours is that we do not aim to derive
the evolution of the ISM but assume that it is known. Figure 3 in Minchev et al. (2018) shows how Galacto-centric
distances are assigned to stars based on their [Fe/H] and
age.
Here we will only use the stars in the low-α sequence as
defined in as defined in Fig. 1 (see discussion in Sect. 2.4).
3.1

Choice of ISM profiles

For our analysis we need a prescription of how the radial
metallicity profile of the ISM varies over time. It is not our
intention here to derive our own profiles, nor to test various profiles against observables (e.g., open cluster, O and
B stars) but instead we are focusing on the method and
exploring its strengths and weaknesses. Nevertheless, it is
valuable to make use of a range of radial profiles to explore
the method we develop. In the literature it is possible to find
a number of radial metallicity profiles that describes how the
ISM evolves over time.
We have selected four sets of radial profiles that describe
how the ISM evolves. The profiles are shown in Fig. 3.1. Below we briefly summarise the major characteristics of each
set, but we refer the reader to the original publications for
further details (Minchev et al. 2018; Frankel et al. 2018;
Sanders & Binney 2015; Kubryk et al. 2015a,b). We have

also obtained radial metallicity profiles from an on-going
cosmological simulation (Agertz et al. in prep.). That analysis can be found in Sect. 4.4.

3.1.1

Minchev et al. (2018)

As described in their paper Minchev et al. (2018) derived the
ISM profiles by forcing a (small) solar neighbourhood sample of stars to reproduce the distributions of formation radii
for stars with different ages from the models by Minchev
et al. (2013). Characteristic for these radial gradients is the
steepening slope of the lines for older ages and the relatively
narrow range of [Fe/H] at the smallest Rgal . The radial gradients implemented in our study are shown in Fig.3.1 a).

3.1.2

They are shown in Fig.3.1 b). The gradients are straight
lines that spread out more and more for the oldest ages.
This is similar to one of the rejected tests by Minchev et al.
(2018).

Frankel et al. (2018)

Frankel et al. (2018) present a model that parametrises the
star formation history, the chemical enrichment history and
profiles that show where in the Galaxy a star forms given
its age and metallicity. They assume that it is possible to
describe the metallicity profile of the star forming gas as a
product of a radial profile and a term describing how the
chemical enrichment evolves over time. They then combine
these with a model for stellar migration modelled as diffusive processes. This results in a model that can quantify the
global efficiency of radial migration.
For our purposes we essentially invert their prescription of where a star forms given its age and metallicity (see
Appendix A1). The result is radial gradients that define the
evolution of the ISM with time suitable for our purposes.

3.1.3

Sanders & Binney (2015)

Sanders & Binney (2015) set up a model of the Galaxy based
on analytic distribution functions. Of interest to us is their
function that describes the relation between age and metallicity for each radius in the Galaxy. The relevant function
is derived by fitting to the model results from Schönrich &
Binney (2009), which includes full chemical evolution as well
as gas accretion and outflow.
Here we invert their prescription to obtain a description
of how the radial gradient of the ISM evolves with time (see
Appendix A2). The result is shown in Fig.3.1 c). We note
that for young ages there is hardly any differentiation at all
– all gas share the same radial distribution at all times up
and until 4 Gyr and for the oldest age (12 Gyr) the relation
is flat at –1 dex since the model assumes that this is the
metallicity of the ISM at the formation of the Galaxy (see
Table 3 in Sanders & Binney 2015).

3.1.4

Kubryk et al. (2015a)

Kubryk et al. (2015a) built a model to study the effects of
radial migration on the chemical evolution of the Milky Way.

rates and yields. They use parametrised time-and radiusdependent diffusion coefficients to describe the radial migration. The parameterisation is based on N-body + SPH
simulations. For further details see their paper.
Although they do not provide a tabulated description of
how the metallicity gradient in the ISM evolves with time,
their Fig. 4 (bottom middle panel) show their results for
three different ages. We reproduce these lines in Fig.3.1 d)
and use them for our study. Because this model explicitly
takes into account the results from the the N-body + SPH
simulations the gradients have less idealised shapes. We use
the three available lines and interpolate between them to
find the formation radii of the stars. This is a simplification
but one we deem reasonable as the lines appear relatively
well-behaved.
3.2

Migratory distance – definition

In order to be able to quantitatively compare and analyse
the results from the different model descriptions of how the
MNRAS 000, 1–15 (0000)

radial metallicity gradient in the ISM has varied we define
the concept of migratory distance. This measure is simply
the difference between the star’s current Galacto-centric distance and the Galacto-centric distance at its formation:
M D = (Rcurrent − Rformation ).

Error on inferred formation radii

The principle to infer the formation radius of a star is simple, but we also need to consider the uncertainties in the
properties used to derive the formation radius. In particular, we need to consider uncertainties in [Fe/H] and age as
well as in stellar coordinates, parallax, proper motions and
radial velocities, all of which transfer into the error of the
current position of the star in the Galaxy.
For errors on [Fe/H] we use the individual errors as
reported in APGOEE DR14 and for ages the error is 40%
according to Martig et al. (2016). For the Galacto-centric

radii we find that an error of 5% being the maximum of our
derived distances taking parallax errors into account. For
most stars the error is between 1 and 3%.
We include these errors in our analysis in the following way. Iterating through each star in the full data set, we
create a new star by assuming a normal error distribution
and drawing new parameters for age, Galactic radius, and
metallicity from a Gaussian where the mean is the original
observed value and the standard deviation the associated
uncertainty for each variable. We do this until we have generated 10 000 variants of each star and therefore 10 000 new
and unique data sets.
We then proceed to analyse the data just as we would
have done for the original sample but now with a sample
where statistical uncertainties can be readily estimated.

Figure 5 shows the resulting formation radii for stars of different ages for the four different sets of radial gradients.
We note that Minchev et al. (2018), Frankel et al. (2018),
and Kubryk et al. (2015a) show the same overall behaviour
where older stars are on average formed further in towards
the Galactic centre. This is largely in accordance with the
criteria used in Minchev et al. (2018), i.e. an in-side out formation of the disk where older stars form in the inner parts
of the disc. Using the radial gradients from Sanders & Binney (2015) on the other hand results in that the majority

orbits. After some experimentation, we find that Lz /Lc >
0.99 is the best definition of a highly circular orbit for our
sample. This is a somewhat arbitrary choice but is supported
by Fig. B1. Figure 2 shows that such stars are present across
the full range of Galacto-centric distances and metallicities.
We believe that the choice of this cut does not significantly
bias our investigation.
For all four age bins we find that stars on highly circular orbits (Lz /Lc > 0.99) have a smaller spread in migratory
distance, on the order of 0.2 kpc. The median distance that
a star has migrated depends on where it has formed – stars
forming in the inner part of the disk have migrated significantly further distances than stars formed close to the sun
or further out in the disk.

ANALYSIS, INTERPRETATION, AND
DISCUSSION

In this section we show how combining the migratory distances with information about the stars’ orbits can be used
to constrain how many of the stars in a sample have, e.g.,
been churned. We discuss different ways of defining if a star
has been churned or not and also look at stars that have not
migrated at all. We also look at the formation radius of the
sun (Sect. 4.3) and investigate the possibility to obtain the
radial metallicity gradients for the ISM from a cosmological
simulation (Sect. 4.4).

4.1

Stars that have migrated

In this section we will consider different ways to decide if
a star or a stellar population has migrated in the Galaxy.
We will provide some examples of how one can estimate the
fractions of stars that have migrated and look at the fraction
of stars that have only been churned.
Figure 7 provides a summary of the results.
4.1.1

Estimating how many stars have radially migrated

The simplest definition of a star that has radially migrated
in the Galaxy is a star for which its formation radius is
not the radius the star formed at. As can be inferred from
Sect. 3.4, the fraction of stars that have moved radially in
the Galaxy is large. Adding orbital information allows for a
more interesting analysis.
Here we consider a slightly more involved criterion for
stars that have migrated in the Milky Way disk; namely stars
that have a Galacto-centric formation radius that is outside
the Galacto-centric radial range spanned by the apo-centre
and the peri-centre of the current orbit of the star:
Rformation < Rperi,current orbit or

(4)

Rformation > Rapo,current orbit
Since there is no requirement set on the shape of the
orbit this implies that the sample of such stars must include
both stars that have been only churned as well as stars that
have been both churned and blurred. Such stars are rather
common, with about half of the stars in our sample fulfilling
this criterium. The results are shown in Fig. 7, where we also
show the results from the sections below. For the models by
Minchev et al. (2018) and Kubryk et al. (2015a) we obtain
a lower fraction of radially migrated stars (about 0.5) while
for the other three models (Frankel et al. 2018; Sanders &

Binney 2015, and, Agertz et al. in prep) we obtain a higher
fraction.

4.1.2

Estimating how many stars have been churned

In this section we explore ways to estimate how many of our
stars that have experienced churning (churning being the
radial migration that causes a star to move radially without
loosing the circularity of its orbit Sellwood & Binney 2002,
see also Sect. 4.5). For this we need to define the sub-sample
of stars that we think should have been subjected to just
churning and not blurring. A star that has been blurred
can also have been churned. This means that what we are
trying to do here is to find a conservative lowest fraction of
stars that have just been churned. We define a star to be
a candidate as a churned star if it has a relatively circular
orbit. We define such stars as those with Lz /Lc > 0.99.
We consider M D (migratory distance) as a function of
stellar age and formation radius, compare Fig. 6. Table 1
summaries our results. The top part of the table lists first
the fraction of stars with highly circular orbits defined as
Lz /Lc > 0.99 (results for stars with Lz /Lc > 0.95 can be
found in Appendix, B3). We find that younger stars have a
larger fraction of stars on circular orbits. This fraction decreases from about 0.18 to 0.12 as the stellar age increases.
An average over all age bins gives a fraction of about 0.15.
Although this is an interesting number we do not think
that this gives a minimum fraction of stars on churned orbits.
To be churned we further require that the the star’s formation radius lies outside of the range of orbits their presentday orbit occupies. As expected this selection gives a smaller
fraction of stars. Again, the fraction decreases with increasing age. The total fraction of stars that these criteria and
hence are prime candidates for having been churned is about
0.1 (see lower part of Table 1).
The results are shown in Fig. 7 where we also include the
same estimates but with a more relaxed criterion on circularity (0.95 instead of 0.99). With the more relaxed criterion
on circularity for the orbits the minimum fraction of churned
orbits increase to about 0.4. However, for reasons discussed
below we do not believe that this gives an indication of the
fraction of churned stars.

4.1.3

Estimating the size of churning and blurring

It is also interesting to attempt to estimate the size of churning and blurring. An analysis as the one provided in Fig. 6
allows us to do this. It is readily seen from this figure that
the spread in M D for all stars is about 0.2 kpc larger than for
stars on highly circular orbits. If we regard the stars on the
highly circular orbits as essentially uninfluenced by blurring
then this gap is an indication of the size of the increased
orbital spread due to blurring. We note that the difference
between the full sample and the sample on highly-circular
orbits is the same for all formation radii for a given age. From
our data we can not say if the difference between samples
remains constant as age increases or not. As both churning
and blurring can be modelled as diffusive processes it is possible that the difference remains the same over time. All five
models investigated in this study show the same patterns.
If we instead consider the x-axis of the plot (M D) we

find that stars in our sample that formed inside the solar circle have migrated on average more than those that formed
outside the solar circle, with a monotonic change in M D as
a function of formation radius. We also note a trend with
age where older stars have a larger M D for the same formation radius as compared to younger stars. This is consistent
with radial migration being a diffusive process. Although the
youngest stars have smaller M D they still show substantial
radial migration, indicating that churning must be a process
that acts quickly on a stellar sample. We know it can not be
blurring as blurring is a slow process and because even the
circular sample shows significant migratory distances.
If we combine this finding with the finding that a minimum of about a tenth of the stars have been exclusively
churned it indicates that about 40% or so of the stars in our
sample have migrated either by being just blurred or blurred
and churned.

4.2

Stars that have not moved

With our methodology it is possible to identify stars that
have not moved radially in the Galaxy since they formed.
We define such stars as those with |M D| < 200 pc. Table 2
summarizes the fraction of these stars for the different models. We find that between 5 and 7% of the stars in our sample
have not moved radially in the Galaxy since they formed.
The number decreases as the age of the stars increases for
all models apart from those from Sanders & Binney (2015)
where the fraction remains constant as a function of stellar age. This is consistent with what we saw in Sect. 3.4
and Fig. 5 where we show that this model produced roughly
the same amount (and spread) in radial migration for all
ages apart from the oldest stars. It appears natural that
populations of older stars should have a smaller fraction of
stars that have not moved radially in the Galaxy since they
formed since over time a star’s position in the Galaxy will be
influenced by several phenomena, not the least blurring and
MNRAS 000, 1–15 (0000)

churning. As time goes a star become more likely to have
suffered from such phenomena and hence its orbit will start
making excursions away from the original circular orbit.
Figure 8 shows the properties of the sample of stars that
have not moved. We note that at all radii there is a large
spread in metallicity as well as age. Metallicity and age appear to correlate well at each radius, such that younger ages
are associated with higher metallicities. In a slightly circular argument this could be taken as proof that indeed at a
given radius there is a tight age-metallicity relation. When
we look at all stars in our sample this is not the case, indeed, many studies of stars in the solar neighbourhood have
shown that there is an acute lack of such a relation (e.g., Edvardsson et al. 1993; Feltzing et al. 2001; Casagrande et al.
2011). It should be noted for our method, that although per
construction more metal-rich stars are younger at a given
Galacto-centric radius they need not be on orbits that have
not moved via churning and/or blurring. It would have been
entirely possibly that there were only stars of one age or one
metallicity at a given radius that were still on the same orbit
they had when they formed. Thus, we believe that this does
give observational support to the assumption that stars at
a given radius in the Galaxy follow a tight age-metallicity
relation.

4.3

The Galacto-centric formation radius of the
Sun

Returning to the question wether or not the Sun has formed
at the solar radius we find that using the radial metallicity gradients for the interstellar medium from Frankel et al.
(2018), Sanders & Binney (2015), and Kubryk et al. (2015a)
the sun formed at a distance from the Galactic centre of 5.7,
7.0, and 6.8 kpc, respectively. Clearly, there are uncertainties associated with these estimates, however, it is also clear
that if we require an inside out-formation scenario in which
the metallicity in the interstellar medium is enriched over
time in such a fashion as to produce flatter and flatter radial gradients then the sun most likely formed between 5.5
and 7 kpc from the Galactic centre. This is largely consistent
with other estimates of the sun’s formation radius (Wielen
et al. 1996; Minchev et al. 2013; Frankel et al. 2018).
Haywood et al. (2019) discusses the possibility that the
sun instead of coming from inside its current solar position
in the Galaxy, it in fact has migrated in from the regions outside the sun’s position. They find that this is supported by
the numerical experiments carried out by Martı́nez-Barbosa
et al. (2016), who uses backward integration in the Galactic potential to find out where a star comes from. As discussed earlier, with the inclusion of churning such integrations looses their ability to make such predictions, i.e. once a
star has been churned you can not any more find out where
it came from. As we have shown not all stars have been
churned, some may just be blurred, others are untouched
by dynamical encounters. So in theory the sun may have an
un-churned orbit and you can retrace its orbit, however, we
note that the fraction of stars in our sample fulfilling this
criterium is small (compare Fig. 7).

4.4

Agertz et al. (in prep)

Agertz et al. (in prep) carried out a cosmological
hydrodynamic+N-body zoom-in simulation of a Milky Waymass galaxy (M? ∼ 6 × 1010 M ) forming in a dark matter
halo with virial mass Mvir = 1.3 × 1012 M at z = 0 . The
simulation was carried out using the adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES (Teyssier 2002), assuming a flat Λ-cold
dark matter cosmology. We refer to Agertz et al. (in prep)
for details, as well as Pehlivan Rhodin et al. (2019) for an
extensive description of the included physics and simulation
settings. The simulation reaches state-of-the-art resolution,
with a mean resolution of ∼ 20 pc in the cold interstellar
medium. For every simulation snapshot we identify the most
massive progenitor to the z = 0 Milky Way-mass galaxy. We
identify the disc plane from the stellar and gaseous angular
momentum vector, and compute radially averaged [Fe/H]profiles from all neutral gas within a 2 kpc thick slab. The
resulting radial ISM profiles are shown in Fig.9 a).
We note that insight drawn from abundance gradients
in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation must be considered with care. While simulated galaxies can be selected
to represent extended discs with global properties in line
with the Milky Way’s, their detailed assembly histories will
not necessarily be compatible with that of the Milky Way
galaxy. However, for this explorative study we find it informative to include these models as a part of our suite of
diverse ISM models.
The radial gradients in Fig.9 a) share many of the overall characteristics of those derived in Minchev et al. (2018)
and those used in Frankel et al. (2018) in as much as they
steepen towards the inner galaxy and older profiles have
lower iron content. Thus, we can expect that overall this
description of the temporal evolution of the radial metallicity profile of the ISM should give rise to similar results as

found for models explored previously. Indeed, that is also
what we see, but with some modifications. Notably, Fig.9
b) shows that although the median radius moves to smaller
and smaller radii as age increases (i.e. an inside out formation scenario as imposed in Minchev et al. 2018) there is
significant spread at all ages.
Also for this model we have derived the fractions of stars
fulfilling the different criteria discussed in Sects. 4.1 and 4.2.
We show these fractions in Fig. 7 together with the results
from the other models. We note that the results from this
model is largely the same as for the other models.
4.5

Discussion

One of the leading takeaways from our experimentation with
this data-set is the apparently rapid onset of radial migration. We find that the median migration distances of the
stars in each of our radial bins remain very constant in
time. This extends out to our oldest age bin, whose stars
generally show identical median migration distances to our
youngest age bin. This implies that the bulk of radial migration must take place relatively early in a starâĂŹs lifetime. We suggest that this could be attributed primarily
to the fact that the period of the spiral bar pattern, dominantly responsible for churning, is significantly shorter than
the width of our youngest age bin. A considerable number
of attempts have been made to constrain the pattern speed
of the spiral arms using hydrodynamic simulations (see for
example Chakrabarty 2007; Bissantz et al. 2003) and observations of nearby velocity fields (Fernández et al. 2001).
Most have placed the period of the spiral arms between 250
and 350 Myr (Gerhard 2011). Thus, a spiral arm crossing is
well-contained within the interval covered by our first age
bin, and given that only a single transient interaction with
a spiral arm is required to generate substantial changes to
MNRAS 000, 1–15 (0000)

Constraining churning and blurring in the Galaxy
a stars angular momentum (Sellwood & Binney 2002), this
should be sufficient to generate the displacements we observe.
This interpretation is also consistent with numerical Nbody simulations which find substantial migration distances
within 1 Gyr due to churning. Indeed, the time-scale for
churning to displace the stars can be as short as 0.5 Gyr
(Grand & Kawata 2016). It has also been observed that the
distribution of stellar radii occupied for stars formed in the
same location spreads dramatically in the first few Gyr, and
slows down considerably at later times (Kubryk et al. 2013).
Our data provide empirical confirmation of these results.
Furthermore, the swift onset of radial migration, and
subsequent invariability of median motions with time, indicates that churning is the dominant mechanism through
which stars initially change their Galactic radii. It has long
been understood that blurring alone is not sufficient to explain the distribution of stars observed in the local region
and it is now understood that that churning plays an integral
part in explaining the locally observed distributions (examples can be found in Schönrich & Binney 2009; Minchev
et al. 2013). Though the relative strengths of churning and
blurring, that is, how much of a stars displacement from
the location it formed can be described by one process or
the other, has not been much studied. This is due fundamentally to the fact that these processes act simultaneously,
and are largely inseparable in observation.
It has been one of our aims in this work to investigate
if it is possible to constrain the relative strengths of the two
processes. Our ability to compare the migration distances
of stars on circular orbits to the total sample enables us to
observe how well the motions in our total sample are explained by a population that has not yet been blurred. In
doing this, we see that churning immediately has a large
effect on stellar radii, while blurring accounts for a comparatively small increase in spread at this time. This result is
seen in the relatively small difference in spread between our
total sample and the circular subset when compared to the
overall spreads of these populations.
Blurring is traditionally modelled as a diffusive process,
gradually increasing the spread of the radial distribution
with time (Sellwood & Binney 2002; Schönrich & Binney
2009). As such, the deviations in radius are smaller and symmetric about the mean. In our data, this is represented by
the equivalent median, though increased spread, in our total
sample when compared to the population of stars on circular
orbits. The difference in spread between these populations
is presumably indicative of the added diffusion from blurring. Meanwhile, the expected changes to angular momentum caused by churning are quite large – several kpc from a
single interaction with the spiral (Sellwood & Binney 2002)
– when compared to the scales of the blurring found in our
data: a spread only 0.2 kpc separating our total sample and
circular subset. This leads us to believe that churning is a
much stronger force than blurring in terms of the magnitude
of displacement.
This is coupled with the observation that our data increases its spread with time, though only slightly from age
bin to subsequent age bin. We have noted that this consistent dispersion in time is present in equal magnitude for
both our total sample and our highly-circular sub-sample.
This implies that the aggregate spreading effect of churning
MNRAS 000, 1–15 (0000)

11

and blurring in our total sample is on the same order as the
effect purely from churning in our circular sample. Thus, beyond the initially large displacements caused by churning in
the first hundreds of Myrs, churning begins to function indistinguishably from blurring, spreading only gradually with
time. However, this is not to say that the distances covered
by churning are less at later times. In fact, stars may be
churned back and forth across the spiral patterns co-rotation
radius many times in their lifetimes on so-called horseshoe
orbits (Sellwood & Binney 2002). But this movement back
and forth contributes little to any net migration when considering the average of the population (Halle et al. 2018),
and serves only to broaden the distribution of present-day
radii in a diffusive pattern reminiscent of blurring. Our results point to a net migration for a very large fraction of
stars.
Previous attempts to constrain the strength of churning using observations from large spectroscopic surveys include Kordopatis et al. (2015); Hayden et al. (2018, 2019).
These studies have mainly identified potentially migrated
stars via the eccentricities of their orbits. Kordopatis et al.
(2015) found that for stars with super-solar metallicities
about half of the stars in their RAVE sample had ecc. < 0.15
(which they took to imply a circular orbit). That such stars
are present at the solar radius is interpreted as evidence
for churning as the ISM is at solar metallicity today and
hence, more metal-rich stars need to come from somewhere
else than the solar neighbourhood. Hayden et al. (2018)
used stars from the Gaia-ESO Survey. They selected stars
with [Fe/H]>0.1 dex and found that about 20% of the stars
in their sample do not reach the Galacto-centric radius at
which they likely formed and can thus have been churned.
Hayden et al. (2019) on the other hand, using a similar approach, find that for stars in the solar neighbourhood observed with GALAH and with ecc. < 0.2 as many as 70% has
reached that location thanks to churning/radial migration.
Compared with our more modest total conservative estimate
of about 15% for our full sample this seems a very large number. On the other hand, Hayden et al. (2019) includes both
high- and low-α stars, whilst we (in agreement with Frankel
et al. 2018) argue that any attempts to constrain churning
for α-enhanced stars is likely to fail due to the complex nature and formation channel of that stellar component which
includes both accretion and turbulent formation scenarios in
the early Universe (some examples include Bournaud et al.
2009; Agertz et al. 2009). We note that our definition of
a circular orbit is much more stringent than used in these
studies. Referring to Fig. B1 we can see that by instead using a cut in ecc. we would indeed have many more stars,
but importantly, say if we cut at 0.15 then that would essentially include a very large portion of the stars with 0.95.
We note that if we relax the criterion for circularity to 0.95
(from 0.99) then the difference between all stars and stars on
circular orbits in Fig. 6 disappears. Meaning that then there
is no difference between the two samples in terms of displacement, indeed it is not possible to distinguish between
churning and blurring (see also discussion in Sect. 4). Hence,
we conclude that although ecc. might appear as an easily understood measure of the orbital shape the more robust Lz /Lc
is a better indicator of the orbital shape.
At this point in the discussion it is important to reiterate two things: 1) our study is of an exploratory nature,

12

we wish to see if we can find means to constrain churning
and blurring the stellar populations in the cold stellar disk in
the Milky Way, 2) the sample we have used is far from perfect for the purposes. We believe that we have succeeded in
showing that there are ways to effectively constrain the size
and strength of churning using simple means to estimate the
migratory distances for stars in the cold stellar disk. In this
work we have made no attempt to account for the selection
effects in our sample. Could some of our conclusions be influenced by this? Our main aim with this work is to establish
ways to constrain the strength of churning and blurring. The
results depends both on the models used (the radial metallicity gradients for the ISM) as well as the quality of stellar
sample, including its physical distribution in the Galaxy. An
inherent assumption is that there are no azimuthal changes
in the stellar population in the Milky Way. This is likely
incorrect, but current data does not allow to address this
question. Future data releases from Gaia coupled with large
spectroscopic surveys as well as dedicated follow-up of, e.g.,
Cepheids and A and B stars across the Milky Way disk will
elevate this problem.
Figure 2 f) and g) show that the stellar sample we use
mainly is situated just outside the solar circle. Although
there are stars between 5 – 11 kpc there is a concentration
around 9 kpc. There is also a slight trend between [Fe/H] and
present day Galacto-centric radius such that more metalpoor stars are found further out in the Galaxy. We know
that the Milky Way stellar disk is well populated also inside
the solar circle but we know less about the metallicities of
those stars. Taking the data at face-value, we can thus conclude that it is likely that we are missing stars on smaller
radii meaning that we will not have such a good view of the
radial migration experienced by the stars that are currently
inside the solar circle. We think, however, that for the stars
beyond the solar circle and inside about 10.5 kpc we have
a pretty good sampling of the stellar population as of today. Thus our inferences about the strength of churning and
blurring, as applied to these stars, should hold – churning is
the stronger process and acts early on in the life of the stars.
Later churning and blurring both acts as diffusive processes
that grow slowly over time.
Future studies must still look in to how the selection
function of the stellar sample influences the results. We have
seen that for our sample of cold disk stars drawn from a
combination of Gaia and APOGEE the results are largely
model independent. That might not necessarily be the case
with a sample defined in a different way and with a different
selection function.

CONCLUSIONS

In this work we set out to explore the possibility to quantify
how many stars have radially migrated in the stellar disk
and, eventually, be able to put numbers on the strength and
importance of the processes involved. We have taken some
first steps on this path by utilising a sample of red giant
stars from APOGEE DR14, Gaia parallaxes and proper motions, and stellar ages derived from C and N abundances in
the stars. This sample has allowed us to quantify how large
a fraction of the stars in the sample have had their orbits
changed from initially circular to non-circular, how many re-

main on circular orbits and how many are on circular orbits
that might have been “churned”.
We find that a conservative estimate is that about 10%
of the stars in the sample have been churned. This is in
contrast to recent studies that have much higher numbers,
however, we note that those studies essentially look at stars
with super-solar metallicities whilst we study stars of all
metallicities. Furthermore, our definition of a highly circular orbit is deliberately conservative. If we instead select the
stars have Galacto-centric radii at formation that lays outside of its apo- as well as peri-centre today, we find that
about half of the stars have undergone some combination of
churning and blurring. We estimate that a robust 5 − 7% of
stars in our sample have not had their orbits blurred, nor
have they been churned. These stars appear at all ages indicating that an individual star may escape these dynamical
processes for quite a long time. Our study also provides tentative observational support to the assumption that stars at
a given radius in the Galaxy follow a tight age-metallicity
relation.
Looking towards the future, there are several on-going
and upcoming large spectroscopic surveys that would be able
to provide data to further explore the relative importance
and strengths of churning and blurring in our Galaxy (e.g.,
WEAVE, 4MOST Balcells et al. 2010; de Jong et al. 2016,
2019, and Jin et al. in prep.). From Gaia we will have the
parallaxes and proper motions, which when combined with
the radial velocities from the spectroscopic surveys will give
the full 6D phase space information needed to calculate stellar orbits. The surveys will also provide the needed metallicity and elemental abundances. Stellar ages are difficult to
derive. The best prospects are for turn-off stars (Sahlholdt
et al. 2019) but to reach large volumes of the Milky Way
require us to use red giants. In this study we have made use
of stellar ages for red giants derived using elemental abundances of C and N and combinations thereof (Martig et al.
2016). It is essential that these and similar methods are further evaluated, developed and validated such that they may
be used, at least in a statistical sense, in studies like the one
presented here.

Manipulating the equations in Frankel et al. (2018) we

[Fe/H](τ) = −1−(−1−0.07·8.74)·((1−τ/12)0.32 )−0.07· R (A1)

Manipulating the equations in Sanders & Binney (2015)
we arrive at the following equation that describes how the
iron content in the ISM changes with radius (R) for a given
age (τ):
F(R) = −0.99 · (1 − exp(−0.064 · (R − 7.37)/0.99))

constants in Eq.(A2 and A3) we refer the reader to Sanders
& Binney (2015). We note that as opposed to the other
models used in our study this one hardly has any evolution
of the ISM radial gradient with time for the time span that
is of interest for the formation of the stars in the cold stellar
disk, i.e. the last 6 to 8 Gyrs.

Comparing Lz /Lc and ecc.

In this work, following Liu & van de Ven (2012), we have
chosen to use Lz /Lc to characterise the circularity of the
stellar orbits. Figure B1 shows a comparison Lz /Lc and ecc..
There is a clear correlation between the two properties. At
a given Lz /Lc there is a substantial spread in ecc.. We note
that our chosen cut for defining very circular orbits is 0.99
for Lz /Lc , this encompasses ecc. in the range 0 to 0.2.

B2

Including a bar in the Galactic potential

The galpy-package allows the user to include a bar when
carrying out the orbital integrations (the reader is referred
to Bovy 2015, for details about the potential) . Figure B2
shows the effect on ecc. when the bar is included in the
potential. Although there are noticeable effects we note that
for stars that we consider to be on circular orbits (which all
have < 0.2, see Sect. B1) the effect is small and hence we
have concluded that we did not need to include a bar in the
Galactic potential for the purpose of this study.
