1 Abstract
We study the set of trapped photons of a subcritical (|a| < M ) Kerr spacetime as
a subset of the phase space. First, we present an explicit proof that the photons of
constant Boyer–Lindquist coordinate radius are the only photons in the Kerr exterior
region that are trapped in the sense that they stay away both from the horizon and
from spacelike infinity.
We then proceed to identify the set of trapped photons as a subset of the (co-)tangent
bundle of the subcritical Kerr spacetime. We give a new proof showing that this set is a
smooth 5-dimensional submanifold of the (co-)tangent bundle with topology SO(3)×R2
using results about the classification of 3-manifolds.
Both results are covered by the rigorous analysis of Dyatlov [5]; however, the methods
we use are very different and shed new light on the results and possible applications.

2 Introduction
It is well-known that in the Schwarzschild spacetime with positive mass M , there is a
family of photons that orbit the center of the spacetime at the fixed radius r = 3M
(in Schwarzschild coordinates), and the surface {r = 3M } which they fill is totally
umbilical and called the photon sphere.
A similar phenomenon is known in the exterior of the subcritical Kerr spacetime:
there is a 2-parameter family of photons which stay at fixed coordinate radius [24]. We
give a thorough, explicit proof that these are the only trapped photons in this spacetime
family (Proposition 2). This fact is often tacitly assumed to be well-known and indeed
follows from Dyatlov’s rigorous analysis [5]; whereas our proof explicitly demonstrates
that the conventional computations (see e.g. [24]) and heuristic arguments indeed do
not overlook any trapped photons.
Unlike in the Schwarzschild situation, the spacetime region in a subcritical Kerr
spacetime where trapped photons are found (the region accessible to trapping or the
photon region) is not a submanifold (with or without boundary) of the spacetime.

Therefore, the spacetime itself seems not the right setting to investigate geometric
properties of photon regions; instead, the (co-)tangent bundle, where the Kerr photon
region will be seen to be a submanifold, is a much better setting for further investigation of its geometry. Of these two bundles, the cotangent bundle seems a more
appropriate structure to understand photon regions, since the natural symplectic form
it carries allows to understand constants of motion as symmetries of the phase space
(see e.g. [22]); and the analysis of the constants of motion plays an important role in
understanding trapped light.
For the Schwarzschild spacetime of positive mass, a direct computation shows that
the set of trapped photons in the cotangent bundle is a submanifold of topology SO(3)×
R2 . The fact that the photon region in the Kerr phase space is a manifold of topology
SO(3)×R2 as well was shown earlier as a consequence of more general results by Dyatlov
in [5], where the implicit function theorem was used on a family of slowly rotating
Kerr spacetimes considering them as perturbations of the Schwarzschild spacetime.
Our proof uses a different, more direct approach, which does not rely on knowledge
about the Schwarzschild case and might help gain better insights into why the set of
trapped photons in the Kerr phase space exhibits the properties in question. Knowing
this alternative way to determine the topology might also be useful in possibly proving
a uniqueness theorem for asymptotically flat, stationary, rotating, vacuum spacetimes
with a photon region, in the spirit of e.g. [1, 3], see below.
Other than being interesting in its own right, understanding the geometry of photon
regions is also relevant in a variety of contexts: light trapping phenomena play a role
in the analysis of stability of black holes (see e.g. the lecture notes [4]), as well as in
gravitational lensing (see e.g. the review [17]). Of current interest is also the role that
photon regions play in the understanding of black hole shadows (see e.g. [10]).
For static spacetimes, trapping of light has turned out to be a useful tool to prove
uniqueness theorems; a static, asymptotically flat vacuum spacetime with a photon
sphere as its inner boundary has to be a Schwarzschild spacetime [1, 3]; analogous results holds for some cases with matter [2, 25, 26, 27], and for one case even perturbative
uniqueness was established [28], see also [20, 21].
Our article is organized as follows: In Section 3, we recall some well-known facts
about the Kerr family and introduce some notation. In Section 4, we give a precise
definition of trapping of light for stationary spacetimes and show that only photons
of constant Boyer–Lindquist radius can be trapped in a subcritical Kerr spacetime.
As a consequence of this, there are no null geodesically complete timelike umbilical
hypersurfaces in the domain of outer communication in subcritical Kerr (Corollary 3).
The subsequent Section 5 explains how the set of trapped light can be understood
as a subset of the (co-)tangent bundle; we prove that the photon region in the Kerr
(co-)tangent bundle is a submanifold (Theorem 9). To this end, we make use of the
characterization of trapped photons in terms of constants of motion and apply the
implicit function theorem twice. Theorem 10 shows that the photon region in the
phase space of a subcritical Kerr spacetime has topology SO(3) × R2 . This is done by
calculating its fundamental group via the Seifert–van Kampen theorem and using the
classification of 3-manifolds.

3 Basic Facts and Notation
We describe the Kerr spacetime of mass M and angular momentum a in Boyer–
Lindquist coordinates (t, r, ϑ, ϕ) with t ∈ R, radius r > 0 suitably large, latitude
0 ≤ ϑ ≤ π, and longitude 0 ≤ ϕ ≤ 2π. We use the following abbreviations:
S := sin ϑ
C := cos ϑ
ρ2 := r2 + a2 cos2 ϑ
∆ := r2 − 2M r + a2
2
A := r2 + a2 − ∆a2 sin2 ϑ.

The
√ domain of outer communication (DOC) is the spacetime patch where r > M +
M 2 − a2 . The Boyer–Lindquist coordinates cover the entire DOC, except the axis
{S = 0}. The breakdown of the metric in this form is a mere coordinate artefact; it
can be extended smoothly over the axis, and so can the Killing vector fields ∂t and ∂ϕ
(see [14]). We treat the subcritical case |a| < M . In this case, the √
horizon {∆ = 0}
has two connected components, and its outer component {r = M + M 2 − a2 } is the
boundary of the DOC.
Furthermore, we assume that a ≥ 0. This is no restriction of generality, since a sign
change of a just means a change of the direction of rotation. If a = 0, we recover the
Schwarzschild metric.
The Kerr spacetime will be denoted by (K, g).
It is well-known that the motion of regular (that is, not entirely contained in the
axis) photons in the DOC of Kerr is governed by the following equations of motion (see
e.g. [14]):
∆ρ2 ṫ = A E − 2M raL,
ρ4 ṙ2 = E 2 r4 + (a2 E 2 − L2 − Q)r2 + 2M ((aE − L)2 + Q)r − a2 Q =: R(r),

The dot denotes the derivative with respect to the affine parameter.
The quantity E = −hγ̇, ∂t i is the energy of a geodesic γ, L = hγ̇, ∂ϕ i its angular momentum, and Q its Carter constant, given as T (γ̇, γ̇), where T is the Killing
tensor given ba T µν = r12 g µν + 2ρ2 l(µ nν) (where lµ = ∆1 (r2 + a2 , 1, 0, a) and nν =
1
(r2 + a2 , −∆, 0, a) are the principal null directions).
2ρ2
For dealing with general geodesics, it is useful to further introduce the quantity
q := g(γ̇, γ̇), which equals zero for null geodesics (photons).

These so-called constants of motion q, E, L, Q are constant along each geodesic, since
they are derived from Killing vectors and Killing tensors, respectively. Note that they
extend over the axis, since the generating tensors do so (see [14]).
Wherever ∂t is timelike, all photons have positive energy E > 0. In case E 6= 0, we
can rewrite the so-called R-equation (2) and Θ-equation (3) as the scaled R-equation
and the scaled Θ-equation, respectively:

with the conserved quotients Φ := EL , and Q := EQ2 (see [24]).
In the Schwarzschild case a = 0, the photons in the DOC with constant r-coordinate
are precisely those that fulfill r(s) = 3M and ṙ(s) = 0 for all parameter values s ∈ R.
The set {r = 3M } in Schwarzschild is called the photon sphere.
It was shown in [24] that in the DOC of a subcritical Kerr spacetime with a 6= 0
all photons with constant r-coordinate (spherical photon orbits) belong to the one= 0 given by

(see (2) and (5)), where r ranges from
r̂1 := 2M (1 + cos(2/3 arccos(−a/M )))
to
r̂2 := 2M (1 + cos(2/3 arccos(a/M ))).
The corotating (counterrotating) orbits (i.e., those with positive (negative) angular

while those at the intermediate radius rm have vanishing angular momentum L.
The function Φtrap : [r̂1 , r̂2 ] → R is strictly monotonically decreasing and has only
one zero, located at rm , while Qtrap : [r̂1 , r̂2 ] → R≥0 has its zeros at r̂1 and r̂2 , is
strictly increasing on [r̂1 , 3M ], and strictly decreasing on [3M, r̂2 ]. The quantity Φtrap
determines the maximal latitude for trapped photons. In particular, trapped photons
with radius r can only reach the the axis {S 2 = 0} if Φtrap (r) = 0.
For these facts and more information about spherical photon orbits (i.e., those of
constant radius) in the Kerr spacetime, see [24].

4 Trapped Photons in the Kerr spacetime
It is natural to ask whether there are more photons than those of constant radial
coordinate which are “trapped” around the Kerr center, without ever falling through
the horizon or escaping to spatial infinity. Before answering this question, we first need
a more precise notion of what it means to be trapped.
We suggest the following definition for the rather general case of stationary spacetimes:
Definition 1. A photon in the DOC of a stationary spacetime is called trapped if its
orbit in the quotient of the DOC under the action of the stationary Killing vector field
∂t is contained in a compact set.
Thus, in the Kerr spacetime, a photon is trapped if and √
only if the range
 of its radial
2
2
coordinate is a relatively compact set contained in M + M − a , ∞ .
Proposition 2. The spherical photons are the only trapped photons in the DOC of a
subcritical (0 < a < M ) Kerr spacetime.
Proof. Let γ = (t, r, ϑ, ϕ) be a trapped photon of non-constant radial coordinate in the
DOC of a subcritical Kerr spacetime. We will first treat the case that γ does not
intersect the axis {S 2 = 0}.
We focus on the subcase that the photon has nonvanishing energy E 6= 0
and investigate the right-hand side R(r) of Equation (2). Since its left-hand side is
manifestly non-negative, γ has to lie in a region of the Kerr space-time where R(r) is
non-negative.
Since the range of the
radial coordinate is a relatively
√ compact
√ trapped photon’s

set contained in M + M 2 − a2 , ∞ , there must be two values M + M 2 − a2 <
r1 < r2 < ∞ such that the photon either turns around when reaching ri (that is, the
sign of ṙ changes at some si with r(si ) = ri ) or asymptotically approaches ri (that is,
lim r(s) = ri or lim r(s) = ri ).
s→+∞

s→−∞

As a consequence, for trapping with non-constant radial
√ component,
 we need two
zeros ri (i = 1, 2) of R(r) that lie in the interval M + M 2 − a2 , ∞ , with R(r) ≥ 0
between these zeros.
Thus, on the search for trapped photons of non-constant coordinate radius, analyzing
the polynomial R(r) of degree 4 with leading coefficient E 2 > 0, one would have to
find constants of motion such that all roots of R are real, and (writing r0 ≤ r1 ≤
r2 ≤ r4 for√these roots) such that r1 , r2 , r3 are outside the outer horizon component
{r = M + M 2 − a2 }, and r1 and r2 do not coincide, see Figure 1.
Since we assumed that E 6= 0, we may work with the scaled R-equation (5). We see
immediately that the coefficient of r2 has
constellation
 to be negative to allow for the
d
R
R
of roots we need (since otherwise dr E 2 would be monotonous and E 2 convex), that
is,
a2 − Φ2 − Q < 0.
(10)
On the other hand, since the left-hand side of the scaled Θ-equation is manifestly
non-negative, choosing a non-positive Q ≤ 0 forces a2 − Φ2 − Q ≥ 0, contradicting
(10). We have thus ruled out the case Q ≤ 0 for trapped light and may focus on the
case Q > 0.

R(M )
= M 2 ((Φ − 2a)2 + M 2 − a2 ) + M 2 Q − a2 Q ≥ M 2 (Φ − 2a)2 ≥ 0,

thus ruling out the existence of trapped light with r 6= const. outside the axis with
nonvanishing energy E.
In the subcase of vanishing energy E = 0, the R-equation reduces to
ρ4 ṙ2 = −(L2 + Q)r2 + 2M (L2 + Q)r − a2 Q.
The roots of the right-hand side of this equation are given by
r
a2 Q
r1,2 = M ± M 2 − 2
,
L +Q
and at least one √
of them (if real) is smaller than the radius of the outer horizon
component, M + M 2 − a2 .
Summing up, so far we have shown that there are no trapped photons contained in
K \ {S 2 = 0} with nonconstant radial component.
We need to treat the case of photons that are contained in the axis {S 2 = 0}
separately. The axis is a 2-dimensional, totally geodesic submanifold with line element
−(1 − 2M r/ρ2 )dt2 + (ρ2 /∆)dr2 ,
so every photon contained in the axis has to fulfill
−(1 − 2M r/ρ2 )ṫ2 + (ρ2 /∆)ṙ2 = 0.
For trapped photons, ṙ has to vanish at some parameter value (at least asymptotically),
while ṫ 6= 0 cannot approach 0. This gives (1 − 2M r/ρ2 ) = 0, that is, ∆ = 0, which
means that the photon is not in the DOC.

6

The case of photons that cross the axis but are not entirely contained in
it can be treated like the off-axis case: the R-equation is also valid on the axis, and the
conditions on the conserved quotients that were derived from the scaled Θ-equation still
would have to be fulfilled, since the conserved quotients can be calculated off-axis.
The statement of Proposition 2 was also discussed in [16], using different techniques,
and follows from [5].
We can use Proposition 2 to show nonexistence of certain umbilical hypersurfaces
in the DOC. We remind the reader that a semi-Riemannian manifold is called null
geodesically complete if every inextendible null geodesic is defined on all of R.
Corollary 3. There are no null geodesically complete, timelike umbilical hypersurfaces
in the DOC of the subcritical Kerr spacetime (with a 6= 0) whose quotient under the
stationary Killing vector field ∂t is contained in a compact set. In particular, none of
the cylinders {r = const.} are umbilical.
Proof. Assume towards a contradiction that there is such a hypersurface S . By Proposition 3 in [18], a timelike hypersurface in a Lorentzian manifold is umbilical if and only
if every null geodesic that is initially tangent to it remains tangent throughout. Since
by the assumption the quotient of S after factoring out ∂t is relatively compact in the
quotient of the DOC, every photon that stays on S has the property√that the range

of its radial coordinate is a relatively compact set contained in M + M 2 − a2 , ∞ .
These two facts combine to the conclusion that every photon that is initially tangent
to S is trapped.
By Proposition 2, the only trapped photons are those of constant radial coordinate,
hence for any given radius where trapped photons exist, there is only one choice for their
conserved quotients Φ and Q (namely, the values for Φtrap and Qtrap from Equations
(7) and (8)). We are free to choose a positive value of E for a trapped photon; that
is, there is one degree of freedom for choosing the constants of motion for a trapped
photon at a given point. These constants of motion determine the off-axis trapped
photons completely, possible up to a sign choice for ϑ̇. That is, at every point in the
Kerr DOC, there is (at most) one degree of freedom for choosing an initial direction
for a trapped photon.
On the other hand, at every point of S , the cone of lightrays tangent to S is 2dimensional, which means that there are two degrees of freedom for choosing trapped
photons at a given point of S . This gives a contradiction, proving that there is no
such S . 1

5 The Kerr Photon Region as a Submanifold of the
(Co-)tangent Bundle
We call the region in the Kerr spacetime where one can find trapped photons the region
accessible to trapping. In contrast to the Schwarzschild case, in the subcritical Kerr
spacetime the region accessible to trapping is not a submanifold (with our without
1

In Schwarzschild, the statement is no longer true, as is demonstrated by the striking counterexample
of the photon sphere {r = 3M }. The proof of Corollary 3 cannot be immitated in the a = 0 case
since there we do not have Equations 7 and 8 at our disposition.

boundary) of the spacetime; it can be imagined as the region covered by a crescent
moon that rotates about an axis through its pointy ends, see Figure 2.
∂ϕ

Figure 2: A t = const. slice of the photon region in the Kerr spacetime.
We will identify the set of trapped photons in any spacetime with a subset of the
(co-)tangent bundle. In the subcritical Kerr spacetime, it turns out that this subset of
the (co-)tangent bundle is a much nicer geometrical object than the region accessible
to trapping.
One can identify geodesics in any pseudo-Riemannian manifold (M, g) with points
in the tangent bundle T M in the following way: The natural map
{geodesics in M } → T M
given by
γ 7→ (γ(0), γ̇(0))
is a bijection by uniqueness of geodesics. The canonical isomorphism T M → T ∗ M now
gives a similar identification of geodesics with points in T ∗ M .
We only consider future-directed trapped photons; by reversing the direction of time
(using the symmetry t 7→ −t) one can extend all statements to past directed photons.
The task in the present section is to show that the photon region in the tangent bundle
of the subcritical Kerr spacetime P 0 ⊆ T K and the photon region in the cotangent bundle P ⊆ T ∗ K (that is, the image of P 0 under the canonical isomorphism T M → T ∗ M )
are smooth submanifolds of T K and T ∗ K, respectively. Of course, statements about
the submanifold structure and the topology of P 0 and P imply each other immediately,
but it will turn out to be useful to work in both settings.
Remark 4. If (M, g) is any spacetime, the above identification allows us to view the
set of photons in M as
{(m, p) ∈ T M : gm (p, p) = 0}.
As the preimage of 0 under (m, p) 7→ gm (p, p), this set is a submanifold of T M (and
as regular as the spacetime itself), since the differential of this map contains the components of 2gm (·, p) as its last n matrix components, and this never vanishes by nondegeneracy of g.
We can naturally extend all functions that were defined on the DOC of Kerr to the
tangent bundle (of the DOC) of the Kerr spacetime, so that now in particular the
constants of motion and the conserved quotients, but also Φtrap and Qtrap are functions

8

on T K. Slightly abusing notation, we will use the same letters to denote these new
functions. This remark applies—mutatis mutandis—also to T ∗ K.
The region accessible to trapping intersects the axis in only two points; justified by
the equatorial symmetry ϑ 7→ −ϑ, we will call one of them the North Pole and the
other one the South Pole, and we will refer to the two connected components of the
region accessible to trapping without the equatorial plane {S 2 = 1} as the Northern
and the Southern Hemisphere.
Remark 5. As it turns out, in order to obtain later the topology of P 0 and P we will
need to construct smooth bundle charts for a spatial slice of the image of P under the
canonical isomorphism T K → T ∗ K. Nonetheless, this only proves that P is a manifold,
not that it is a submanifold of T ∗ K. Even if one is only interested in the manifold
structure of P 0 and P , not their submanifold structure, the proof of the submanifold
property has advantages over the explicit construction of charts, since the latter will
turn out to be quite technical.
On T K = K × R4 , we use coordinates (t, r, ϑ, ϕ, p0 , p1 , p2 , p3 ), where (p0 , p1 , p2 , p3 )
are the components of the contravariant tangent vector in the same coordinate basis.
Remark 6. In the Schwarzschild case a = 0, it is easy to see that the photon sphere lifts
to a submanifold of the tangent bundle of Schwarzschild: this photon region consists
precisely of all photons of the form (t, 3M, ϑ, ϕ, p0 , 0, p2 , p3 ) and is thus in particular a
submanifold of the space of all photons.
We shall now consider the situation in the subcritical Kerr spacetime with a 6= 0.
Proposition 7. The Kerr photon region in the (co-)tangent bundle T K (T ∗ K) of a
subcritical Kerr spacetime is a smooth submanifold when the axis {S 2 = 0} is deleted;
that is, P 0 \ {S 2 = 0} is a smooth submanifold of T K (and P \ {S 2 = 0} is a smooth
submanifold of T ∗ K).
Proof. We will prove the statement for P 0 ⊆ T K.
By the equations of motion and the conditions for trapped photons (see [14] and
[24]), a Kerr geodesic γ = (t, r, ϑ, ϕ, p0 , p1 , p2 , p3 ) is a trapped photon if and only if

In the case C 6= 0, combining Equations (21) and (23) yields

C2
But since Qtrap ≥ 0 in the region accessible to trapping, this implies that Φ2trap and
Qtrap vanish for the same value of r, which cannot happen (see Section 3).
In the case C = 0, Equations (21) and (22) give Qtrap = 0 and ∂Q∂rtrap = 0, which
also cannot happen for the same radius r, see Section 3.
We have thus derived a contradiction from the assumption that the differential of f
does not have full rank somewhere on the off-axis photon region.
Thus, 0 is a regular value of f , and we may conclude by the submersion theorem
that the photon region of the Kerr spacetime with deleted axis is a submanifold of the
tangent bundle T K.
Φ2trap + Qtrap

Due to the coordinate failure, we have to deal with the axis separately. To do this,
we will once again use the submersion theorem, this time applying it to a different
function T K → R3 .
Proposition 8. For a subcritical Kerr spacetime K, there is a neighborhood of the
North (resp. South) Pole of the photon region P 0 which is a smooth submanifold of T K
(or equivalently, a neighborhood of the North (resp. South) Pole of the photon region
P which is a smooth submanifold of T ∗ K).
Proof. We consider the function h : T K → R3 given by
h = (h1 , h2 , h3 ) := (q, Q − E 2 · Qtrap , L − E · Φtrap ),
where Qtrap , Φtrap are again the functions given in Equations (7) and (8).
Clearly, the upper hemisphere of the photon region can be described as
{(m, p) ∈ T K : p0 ((m, p)) > 0, h((m, p)) = 0}.
The task is to show that h is a submersion in a neighborhood of P 0 ∩ {S 2 = 0} in

11

T K. For the calculations near the axis, we change coordinates
(t, r, ϑ, ϕ) 7→ (t, r, x := r cos ϕ sin ϑ, y := r sin ϕ sin ϑ).
We can work with the new coordinates on each hemisphere; for simplicity let us only
consider the Northern Hemisphere, which suffices by the equatorial symmetry. Since
also p2 , p3 fail on the axis, we change the pi accordingly (p0 , p1 , p2 , p3 ) 7→ (e
p0 , pe1 , pe2 , pe3 ),
where pe0 , pe1 , pe2 , pe3 are the natural coordinates adapted to our new coordinate system
on the Northern Hemisphere of K, i.e.,

pe3 is non-zero, since we can exclude pe2 = pe3 = 0. (Photons on the axis with

pe2 = pe3 = 0 are radial in- or outgoers, hence not trapped.) Similarly, the last row

intersects the axis (in the tangent bundle), it is enough to show that ♥ =

We have thus seen that the differential of h is surjective at every axis point of the
photon region P 0 in the tangent bundle. By the submersion theorem we may conclude
that a neighborhood of the North (similarly: South) Pole of P 0 is a submanifold of
T K.
From Propositions (8) and (7), we immediatley get the following:
Theorem 9. For a subcritical Kerr spacetime K, the photon region P 0 in T K and the
photon region P in T ∗ K are smooth submanifolds.

6 The Topology of the Kerr Photon Region in the
(Co-)tangent Bundle
We now turn our attention to the topology of P 0 and P . From now on, it will be more
useful to work with P ⊆ T ∗ K. We will prove the following theorem towards the end of
this section and first show important lemmata and propositions to be used in the proof.
The claim of Theorem 10 follows from Dyatlov’s implicit function theorem argument
in Section 3 of [5].
Theorem 10. The Kerr photon region and in particular the Schwarzschild photon
sphere in the (co-)tangent bundle have topology SO(3) × R2 .
Proof. Since the photon region in any member of the Kerr family is invariant under
time translation ∂t and under rescaling of energy (E, p0 , p1 , p2 , p3 ) 7→ λ (E, p0 , p1 , p2 , p3 ),
λ > 0, we may therefore restrict our attention to a 6-dimensional slice
{t = 0, p0 (= −E) = −1}

14

in the cotangent bundle and show that the photon region in this slice,
P0 := P ∩ {t = 0, p0 (= −E) = −1},
has topology SO(3).
In the Schwarzschild case, we see immediately that P0 is the bundle of tangent 1spheres to the 2-sphere {r = 3M }. Such a sphere bundle is, of course, topologically
just T 1 S2 , and it is well-known that T 1 S2 is homeomorphic to SO(3).
The remainder of this section is dedicated to the proof of the rotating Kerr case. In
order to construct explicit bundle charts of P0 , we first prove the following
Lemma 11. Consider a Kerr spacetime with 0 < a < M .
1. There are smooth functions rmin , rmax : (0, π) → R that give, for every ϑ ∈
(0, π), the minimal and maximal Boyer–Lindquist radii where trapped photons
with latitude ϑ may be located.
2. There is a smooth function r : (0, π) × [−1, 1] → R with
r(ϑ, −1) = rmin
r(ϑ, 0) = rm , and
r(ϑ, 1) = rmax



for all ϑ ∈ (0, π), and with r π2 + ϑ, · = r π2 − ϑ, · for all ϑ ∈ 0, π2 ,
(where rm is given by Formula (9)), and with the additional property that r(ϑ, ·) has a
smooth inverse for every ϑ ∈ (0, π).
The function r(ϑ, ·) parametrizes the radial width of the crescent moon in Figure 2.
Proof.
1. The boundary of the region accessible to trapping in the spacetime is
exactly where trapped photons have vanishing ϑ-motion (ϑ̇ = 0); hence, the
wanted functions rmin , rmax are given implicitly by the requirements that the righthand side of the Θ-equation (3) with Q = Qtrap (r) and Φ = Φtrap (r) plugged in
vanishes:

0 = Qtrap (rmin (ϑ)) − Φtrap (rmin (ϑ)) − a2 cos2 (ϑ),

0 = Qtrap (rmax (ϑ)) − Φtrap (rmax (ϑ)) − a2 cos2 (ϑ)
for all ϑ ∈ (0, π), and the additional conditions that rmin < rm < rmax and that
rmin (ϑ), rmax (ϑ) are the the zeros of Θ(·, ϑ) = 0 that are closest to rm (ϑ) for each
ϑ.
Thus, rmin and rmax are well-defined by elementary properties of the region accessible to trapping, and smoothness follows from the smooth dependence of Θ
on r and ϑ.
2. This follows directly from the first part of the lemma, for example by explicitly
defining

(rm (ϑ) − rmin (ϑ)) s + rm (ϑ)

For the following lemma, we fix some notation and interpret the product S1 × S1
as follows: let the first factor S1 be parametrized by ϕ ∈ [−π, π), and the second
factor S1 be viewed as [−1, 1] × {−1, 1}/ ∼S1 , where ∼S1 is the equivalence relation
on [−1, 1] × {−1, 1} generated by identifying (±1, 1) with (±1, −1). We thus denote
elements of S1 × S1 in the form (ϕ, s, ς).
Recall that we write P0 = P ∩ {t = 0, p0 = −1}.
Lemma 12. There are functions p2 , p3 : (0, π) × S1 × S1 → R such that the map
H : (0, π) × S1 × S1 → P0 \ {S 2 = 0},
given in Boyer–Lindquist coordinates in the form
(ϑ, ϕ, s, ς) 7→ H(ϑ, ϕ, s, ς) = (r(ϑ, s), ϑ, ϕ, 0, p2 (ϑ, ϕ, s, ς), p3 (ϑ, ϕ, s, ς))
is a diffeomorphism, where r is defined as in Lemma 11 (and hence only depends on
|ϑ − π2 | and s).
Proof. We define functions p2 , p3 : (0, π)×S1 ×S1 → R as the solutions of Equations (16)
and (17) with r(ϑ, s) plugged in for r and E = 1 plugged in for e, and with the additional
requirement that sgn p2 (ϑ, ϕ, s, ς) = ς. In other words,

where we use the shorthand r = r (ϑ, s).
Both p2 and p3 are smooth on (0, π) × S1 × S1 , and they are of course, as the notation
suggests, meant to be used as 7-th and 8-th coordinate in T K.
Then, a function p0 is defined as the unique positive solution to

g (p0 , 0, p2 , p3 ), (p0 , 0, p2 , p3 ) = 0;
it is smooth by smoothness of the metric g.
The functions p2 , p3 from the present lemma are obtained by type-changing the vector
0
(p , 0, p2 , p3 ) ∈ TK.
Bijectivity of H is clear by the construction, and smoothness of the inverse map H −1
follows directly from the fact that for every ϑ ∈ (0, π), the radial width function r(ϑ, ·)
has a smooth inverse.
Lemma 13. Let 0 < ϑ0 < π and Iϑ0 := (Φtrap (rmin (ϑ0 )), Φtrap (rmax (ϑ0 ))). There is
a unique smooth function p2 : Iϑ0 → R≥0 , p3 7→ p2 (p3 ) such that there is an element
of P0 with latitude ϑ0 , angular momentum p3 , and third covariant Boyer–Lindquist
coordinate p2 = p2 (p3 ).
If sin2 ϑ0 is small enough, p2 is concave.

16

Proof. Recall that the covariant Boyer–Lindquist coordinate p3 coincides with the
scaled angular momentum Φ = Φtrap for every photon in P0 . Since Φtrap is strictly
decreasing in r on the photon region, we may regard r as a function of p3 and write
r(p3 ) for the solution of p3 = Φtrap (r).
Similarly to the treatment of the functions p2 , p3 in the proof of Lemma 12, we use
Equation (6) to see that p2 > 0 is given by
(p2 )2 = Qtrap (r(p3 )) − (p3 )2 − a2

Lemma 14. There is a 0 < ε < 1 such that the neighborhood P0 ∩ {sin2 ϑ < ε} of the
North and South Pole in of the photon region in the phase space slice {t= 0, p0 = −1}
of a subcritical Kerr spacetime is is diffeomorphic to S2 ∩ {sin2 ϑ < ε} × S1 via

Ψ : P0 ∩ {sin2 ϑ < ε} → S2 ∩ {sin2 ϑ < ε} × S1 ,
where Ψ is given in the coordinates of the proof of Proposition 7 by
Ψ(0, r, ϑ, ϕ, −1, 0, pe2 , pe3 ) := (ϑ, ϕ, [atan2(e
p2 , pe3 )]) .
(A definition of atan2 is given in the proof below.)
Proof. We now view the sphere S1 as the quotient of the real line that is obtained by
factoring out the equivalence relation generated by u ∼ u + 2π and denote its elements
by [u] := {u + 2πk : k ∈ Z}.
Note that using (ϑ, ϕ) also on the poles causes no problem, even though they are
not coordinate functions at the poles.
As usual, atan2 : R2 \ {(0, 0)} → (−π, π] gives the angle between the positive pe2 -axis
and (e
p2 , pe3 ) (keeping
its sign) and is defined by

Let ε > 0 be such that the function p2 (ϑ, ·) from Lemma 13 is concave for every ϑ
with sin2 ϑ < ε.
The map Ψ as given in the claim is well-defined and smooth. We write ΨNorth and
ΨSouth for the restrictions of Ψ to the Northern and Southern pole caps P0 ∩ {sin2 ϑ <
ε, ϑ < (>) π2 }. Since the union of the pole caps is disjoint, it suffices to show that ΨNorth
and ΨSouth are diffeomorphisms.
Focusing on ΨNorth , we prove that ΨNorth is a bijection by arguing that for fixed

17

(ϑ0 , ϕ0 ), the map
ΨNorth (0, r, ϑ0 , ϕ0 , −1, 0, ·, ·) : P0 ∩ {ϑ = ϑ0 , ϕ = ϕ0 , } → {ϑ0 , ϕ0 } × S1
is bijective:
First we fix a (ϑ0 , ϕ0 ) ∈ S2 with ϑ0 < π, sin2 ϑ0 < ε.
We need to show that [atan2] maps the set
{(e
p2 , pe3 ) ∈ R2 : ∃ r such that (0, r, ϑ0 , ϕ0 , −1, 0, pe2 , pe3 ) is a trapped photon}
bijectively to S1 . To this end, we change from the covariant coordinates pe2 , pe3 to the
ones that belong to Boyer–Lindquist coordinates, p2 and p3 . The set
{(p2 , p3 ) ∈ R2 : ∃ r such that (0, r, ϑ0 , ϕ0 , −1, 0, p2 , p3 ) is a trapped photon}
bounds a convex region around the origin in R2 , since it can be piecewise parametrized
by p3 7→ (±p2 (p3 ), p3 ), where p2 is the concave function from Lemma 13. Its image
under the linear bijection
R2 3 (p2 , p3 ) 7→ (tan ϑ0 · (cos ϕ0 p2 − sin ϕ0 p3 ), − sin ϕ0 p2 + cos ϕ0 p3 ) ∈ R2
is also a convex set around the origin, which means that [atan2] maps it bijectively to
S1 .
On the other hand, one can easily check that
atan2(e
p2 , pe3 ) = atan2 (tan ϑ0 · (cos ϕ0 p2 − sin ϕ0 p3 ), − sin ϕ0 p2 + cos ϕ0 p3 ) ,
since

pe2
pe3

can be rewritten in terms of p2 and p3 as
cos ϕ0 p2 − sin ϕ0 p3
pe2
= tan ϑ0 ·
pe3
− sin ϕ0 p2 + cos ϕ0 p3

if pe3 6= 0, and sgn pe2 = sgn (cos ϕ0 p2 − sin ϕ0 p3 ).
This proves that ΨNorth (0, r, ϑ0 , ϕ0 , −1, 0, ·, ·) : P0 ∩{ϑ = ϑ0 , ϕ = ϕ0 } → {ϑ0 , ϕ0 }×S1
is bijective for every (ϑ0 , ϕ0 ) ∈ S2 with ϑ0 < π, sin2 ϑ0 < ε.
Now we show that ΨNorth |{S 2 =0} is a bijection onto {S 2 = 0} × S1 :
At the North Pole {S 2 = 0} of the region accessible to trapping, every lightlike point
in the phase space with pe1 = 0 is a trapped photon, and it is obvious by the rotational
symmetry of the Kerr spacetime that the set {(e
p2 , pe3 ) : (−1, 0, pe2 , pe3 ) is a photon} is a
circle around the origin in the pe2 -e
p3 -plane. As before, it is mapped bijectively under
[atan2] onto S1 .
We have now seen that ΨNorth is bijective. A straightforward calculation yields that
the differential of ΨNorth has full rank everywhere, so that by the implicit function
theorem ΨNorth is a diffeomorphism, which proves the claim.
In order to determine the topology of P0 (and thereby the topology of P ), we will first
use the maps H and Ψ that were constructed in the Lemmata 12 and 14 to conclude:

18

Proposition 15. The Kerr photon region slice P0 has first fundamental group Z2 .
Proof. The diffeomorphisms H from Lemma 12 and Ψ from Lemma 14 will be used in
what follows. Recall (from the proof of Lemma 8) the covariant coordinates pei that are
naturally associated with the coordinates (t, r, x = r cos ϕ sin ϑ, y = r sin ϕ sin ϑ).
While UNorth ≈ B1 (0) × S1 and USouth ≈ B1 (0) × S1 both have Z as their first
fundamental group, UEq ≈ (−π, π) × S1 × S1 has first fundamental group Z × Z.
Moreover, π1 (UEq ∩ UNorth ) = π1 (UEq ∩ USouth ) = Z × Z.
Let π2 < ϑ0 < π be such that every point of P0 with latitude ϑ0 is in the domain of
ΨNorth . We define homotopies of closed paths γ1 , γ2 : S1 × I → P0 by
γ1,λ (ϕ) := H (ϑ0 − λ(2ϑ0 − π), ϕ, 0, −1) ,
γ2,λ (s, ς) := H (ϑ0 − λ(2ϑ0 − π), 0, s, ς) .
By construction, the paths γ1,0 and γ2,0 are representatives of a set of generators for
π1 (UEq ∩ UNorth ), and the analogous statement holds for γ1,1 and γ2,1 in π1 (UEq ∩ USouth ),
as well as for γ1,λ and γ2,λ in π1 (UEq ) (for every λ).
We will now determine what elements in π1 (UNorth ) the paths γi,0 represent and what
elements in π1 (USouth ) the paths γi,1 represent (for i = 1, 2).
Note that by construction of H, the image of each γ1,λ consist of points with r = rm
and hence with p3 = 0.
This makes it easy to calculate—using the standard transformations for the coordinates of the phase part of T K ∗ —that for points in the image of a path γ1,λ with
λ 6= 21 :

pe2 ◦ γ1,λ (ϕ) =

(24)
(25)

where we use ϑ as shorthand for ϑ(λ) = ϑ0 − λ(2ϑ0 − π) and p2 as shorthand for
p2 ◦ γ1,λ (ϕ).
Clearly, |p2 | ◦ γ1,λ (ϕ) can be calculated from p3 ◦ γ1,λ = 0, r ◦ γ1,λ = rm , and the
modulus of the latitude, |ϑ − π2 |. Since we have chosen negative sign of p2 for all points
in the range of γ1,λ , even p2 ◦ γ1,λ (ϕ) only depends on |ϑ − π2 |.
This allows us to simplify (24)–(25) to
pe2 ◦ γ1,0 (ϕ) = A cos ϕ,
pe2 ◦ γ1,1 (ϕ) = −A cos ϕ,
pe3 ◦ γ1,λ (ϕ) = B sin ϕ for λ = 0, 1
for positive constants A, B.
We see from these formulas that the map P3 ◦ Ψ ◦ γ1,0 : S1 → S1 (where P3 is the
projection onto the third component), given by [atan2(e
p2 ◦ γ1,0 , pe3 ◦ γ1,0 )], has index 1
1
and is hence homotope to the identity map on S .
Similarly, P3 ◦ Ψ ◦ γ1,1 : S1 → S1 is of index −1 and can be thought of as the map
-id : S1 → S1 .

19

We may thus note for later use Fact 1: the path Ψ◦γ1,0 is equivalent to ϕ 7→ (ϑ0 , 0, ϕ)
in π1 (Ψ(UNorth ∩ UEq )), and the path Ψ ◦ γ1,1 is equivalent to ϕ 7→ (π − ϑ0 , 0, −ϕ) in
π1 (Ψ(USouth ∩ UEq )).
Similarly as we just did for γ1,λ , we now calculate the components pe2 and pe2 on the
orbits of γ2,λ for λ 6= 21 :

Here, p2 and p3 depend on ϑ(λ) = ϑ0 − λ(2ϑ0 − π) and (s, ς). Actually, p2 and p3 are
independent of the sign of ϑ − π2 , since the function r used in the construction of H is.
This allows us to write
e 2,
pe2 ◦ γ2,0 (s, ς) = −Ap

pe2 ◦ γ2,1 (s, ς) = Ap

We already know that γ2,0 represents one of the generators of π1 (UEq ∩ UNorth ), and
that γ2,1 represents one of the generators of π1 (UEq ∩ USouth ). Choosing an orientation
for S1 ≡ [−1, 1] × {−1, 1}/ ∼S1 , we can decide that P3 ◦ Ψ ◦ γ2,i : S1 → S1 has index 1.
Then P3 ◦Ψ◦γ2,i : S1 → S1 has index −1. We can now state Fact 2: the path Ψ◦γ2,0 is
equivalent to ϕ 7→ (ϑ0 , 0, ϕ) in π1 (Ψ(UNorth ∩ UEq )), and the path Ψ ◦ γ1,1 is equivalent
to ϕ 7→ (π − ϑ0 , 0, −ϕ) in π1 (Ψ(USouth ∩ UEq )).
In the last step of the proof, we finally calculate π1 (P0 ) using the Seifert–van Kampen
theorem. Combining Fact 1 and Fact 2, we note that in π1 (UNorth ∩ UEq ),
[γ1,0 ]π1 (UNorth ∩UEq ) = [γ2,0 ]π1 (UNorth ∩UEq ) ,
and in π1 (USouth ∩ UEq ), that
[γ1,1 ]π1 (USouth ∩UEq ) = [γ2,1 ]π1 (USouth ∩UEq ) .
We apply the Seifert–van Kampen theorem two times; first to UNorth and UEq , then
to UNorth ∪ UEq and USouth ).
For the sake of readability, the homomorphisms of the different fundamental groups
induced by the various inclusion maps are notationally omitted.
Using the group presentations
π1 (UNorth ) = h[γ1,0 ]π1 (UNorth ) , [γ2,0 ]π1 (UNorth ) i
and
π1 (UEq ) = h[γ1,0 ]π1 (UEq ) , [γ2,0 ]π1 (UEq ) i,
one obtains π1 (UEq ∪ UNorth ) by factoring the identifications

20

[γ1,0 ]π1 (UNorth ) = [γ2,0 ]π1 (UEq ) ,
[γ1,0 ]π1 (UNorth ) = [γ1,0 ]π1 (UEq )
out of the group
h[γ1,0 ]π1 (UNorth ) , [γ2,0 ]π1 (UNorth ) , [γ1,0 ]π1 (UEq ) , [γ2,0 ]π1 (UEq ) i.
Now, π1 (P0 ) = π1 ((UEq ∪ UNorth ) ∪ USouth ) can be calculated by factoring the identifications
[γ1,1 ]π1 (USouth ) = [γ2,0 ]π1 (UEq ) ,
[γ1,1 ]π1 (USouth ) = [γ1,0 ]π1 (UEq ) ,
(which come from Facts 1 and 2) out of the free product of π1 (UEq ∪ UNorth ) with
π1 (USouth ).
Hence, π1 (P0 ) is the quotient of h[γ1,0 ]π1 (UEq ) , [γ2,0 ]π1 (UEq ) , [γ1,0 ]π1 (UNorth ) , [γ1,1 ]π1 (USouth ) i
after factoring out the identifications
[γ1,0 ]π1 (UNorth ) = [γ2,0 ]−1
,
π1 (UEq )
[γ1,0 ]π1 (UNorth ) = [γ1,0 ]π1 (UEq ) ,
[γ1,1 ]π1 (USouth ) = [γ2,0 ]π1 (UEq ) ,
[γ1,1 ]π1 (USouth ) = [γ1,0 ]π1 (UEq ) .
The quotient we are left with is the group Z2 .
We are now going to conclude in a very short argument that the photon region in
the phase space of a subcritical Kerr spacetime has topology SO(3) × R2 :
Proof of Theorem 10. Since P0 is a closed 3-dimensional manifold with π1 (P0 ) = Z2 , it
is doubly covered by an S3 (by the Poincaré conjecture). By the elliptization conjecture,
this S3 can be taken to be the standard 3-sphere and the group Z2 as a subgroup of
SO(3) acting on it. (For the statements of the Poincaré and the elliptization conjecture,
see e.g. [9, 19]; for the proofs covering these conjectures see [6, 8, 7].) Hence, P0 is the
quotient S3 /Z2 ≈ RP 3 ≈ SO(3).
Recalling how P0 was obtained as a slice P ∩ {t = 0, p0 = −1} of the photon region
in the phase space, this proves Theorem 10.

7 Outlook
We have described how the phenomenon of trapping of light in subcritical Kerr spacetimes can be better understood in the framework of the cotangent bundle and have
characterized the set of (future) trapped photons as a submanifold of T ∗ K with topology SO(3) × R2 . It is natural to ask if analogous results can be obtained with similar

21

methods for other stationary spacetimes, possibly involving a cosmological constant.
Note that in [5], the implicit function argument for the computation of the topology of
the photon sphere in the phase space is also applied to the Kerr–de Sitter spacetime.
Null geodesics of constant coordinate radius in (various subfamilies of) the Plebański–
Demiański class of metrics have been studied in [11, 12]. To our knowledge, it has not
yet been rigorously investigated whether these photon orbits are the only trapped photons in the respective spacetimes, which would be a crucial first step for a geometric
understanding of the photon region. Results for spherical photons in the Plebański–
Demiański spacetime family show a very similar spacetime picture of trapping as in
the Kerr family ([11, 12]); one might also hope to prove in this setting that the photon
region in the phase space is a submanifold with topology SO(3) × R2 , but of course,
the calculations would become much more involved in this generalized setting.
We can also ask similar questions about the photon region in stationary spacetimes of
higher dimensions. By the symmetry of a Schwarzschild–Tangherlini black hole [23] of
dimension n + 1 and mass M , it is known that trapping of light occurs at a fixed radius
r = nM for every photon that is initially tangent to the hypersurface {r = nM }.
Hence (by arguments just like in the 4-dimensional Schwarzschild case), the photon
region in the phase space can be expected to be a submanifold with the topology of a
tangent unit sphere bundle T 1 Sn−1 , times R2 .
It seems reasonable to conjecture that for Myers–Perry spacetimes of dimenion n+1,
the photon region in the phase space has the same topology and bundle structure as
the one of the Schwarzschild–Tangherlini solution of dimension n + 1 ( whether the
various rotation parameters coincide or not), since letting the rotational parameters
tend to zero should not cause jumps in the topology, just as in the 3 + 1-dimensional
Kerr case. This can, however, not be proved by similar methods as the ones we used
for the 4-dimensional case, since our proof relies on the classification of 3-manifolds
via their fundamental groups, and there is no similar classification available for higher
dimenions.
The presented way to determine the topology of the Kerr photon region in phase
space might turn out to be useful in proving a uniqueness theorem for asymptotically
flat, stationary, vacuum spacetimes with a photon region inner boundary, in the spirit
of the static results in this direction discussed in the introduction.
