HYPERCYCLIC ALGEBRAS FOR CONVOLUTION OPERATORS
OF UNIMODULAR CONSTANT TERM
J. BÈS, R. ERNST, AND A. PRIETO
Abstract. We study the existence of hypercyclic algebras for convolution
operators Φ(D) on the space of entire functions whose symbol Φ has unimodular constant term. In particular, we provide new eigenvalue criteria for the
existence of densely strongly algebrable sets of hypercyclic vectors.

1. Introduction
Once a linear dynamical system (X, T ) supports a hypercyclic vector, that is,
a vector x whose orbit {T n x}∞
n=0 is dense, the space X always contains a dense
linear subspace consisting entirely (but zero) of hypercyclic vectors [18]. When we
further assume X to be a topological algebra, it is natural to ask whether T can
support a hypercyclic algebra, that is, a subalgebra of X consisting entirely (but
zero) of hypercyclic vectors.
Particular attention has been given to this question for the case where X =
H(C) is the algebra of entire functions on the complex plane, endowed with the
compact-open topology, and where T is a convolution operator, that is, an operator
that commutes with all translations. Godefroy and Shapiro [13] showed that such
operators are precisely the ones that commute with the operator D of complex
differentiation, that they coincide with the operators of the form T = Φ(D) with
Φ ∈ H(C) of exponential type, and that a convolution operator supports hypercyclic
vectors precisely when it is not a scalar multiple of the identity.
Aron et al [2] first noted that any translation τa , which is the operator Φ(D)
with Φ(z) = eaz , fails to support a hypercyclic algebra in a dramatic way: given
any f ∈ H(C), the multiplicity of any zero of an element in the orbit of f p must be
divisible by p. They also stopped short from giving a positive answer for D, showing
that for the generic element f of H(C), each power f n (n ∈ N) is a hypercyclic
vector for D. Shkarin [17], and independently Bayart and Matheron [4] finally
showed that D supports a hypercyclic algebra, prompting the question:
Question 1. Which convolution operators support a hypercyclic algebra? In other
words, for which Φ ∈ H(C) of exponential type does Φ(D) support a hypercyclic
algebra?
Several new positive examples were obtained since then by various authors [8, 9,
6], including for instance when Φ is of subexponential growth having zero constant

term, or of growth order one such as Φ(z) = cos(z) or Φ(z) = zez , say. Recently
Bayart [3] provided a complete characterization for the case when Φ(0) has modulus
strictly smaller than one, and provided a large class of examples when Φ is of
subexponential growth and has unimodular constant term:
Theorem 1.1. (Bayart) [3, Theorem 1.1] Let Φ be a non-constant entire function
of exponential type.
1. Assume that |Φ(0)| < 1. Then the following are equivalent:
(i) Φ(D) supports a hypercyclic algebra.
(ii) Φ is not a scalar multiple of an exponential function.
2. Assume that |Φ(0)| = 1 and that Φ has subexponential growth. If either
Φ′ (0) 6= 0 or Φ has order less than 1/2, then Φ(D) supports a hypercyclic
algebra.
The purpose of this paper is to continue the study of hypercyclic algebras for
convolution operators Φ(D) with unimodular constant term Φ(0). Notice that it
suffices to understand the case when Φ(0) = 1, as by the León-Müller Theorem [16]
any operator T has the same hypercyclic vectors as a scalar multiple λT whenever
the scalar λ has modulus one. We can say the following (see Subsection 1.1):
Theorem 1.2. Let Φ be a non-constant entire function of exponential type, with
Φ(0) = 1.
(a) If Φ is of subexponential growth, then Φ(D) has a hypercyclic algebra.
(b) Ṡuppose Φ is not of subexponential growth.
1. If Φ has no zeroes, then Φ(D) has no hypercyclic algebra.
2. If Φ is of the form Φ(z) = eaz p(z) for some non-constant polynomial
p(z) = 1 + a1 z + a2 z 2 + · · · + ar z r
and some non-zero scalar a with a1 a−1 ∈ C \ R or with 2a2 6= a21 , then
Φ(D) supports a hypercyclic algebra.
3. If Φ has infinitely many zeros and

(i) If P n=1 |zn |−1 converges, then Φ(D) has a hypercyclic algebra.

(ii) If n=1 |zn |−1 diverges and the symbol a is non-zero then Φ(D)
has a hypercyclic algebra.

The proof of Theorem 1.2 is based on Theorem 1.3 and Theorem 1.6 below.
Theorem 1.3. Let Φ be entire of exponential type with |Φ(0)| = 1 and
Φ′′ (0)Φ(0) 6= Φ′ (0)2 .

Suppose that Φ−1 (D) contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions of the form
{ja}m
j=1 , where a 6= 0 and m ∈ N. Then Φ(D) supports a hypercyclic algebra.
Example 1.4. Let Φ(z) = cos(z) or Φ(z) = sin(z) + e−z . Then Φ(D) supports a
hypercyclic algebra.
Proof. In either case we have Φ(0) = 1 and Φ′′ (0)Φ(0) 6= (Φ′ (0))2 , and Φ−1 (D) has
arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions of the desired form.

πz .

Then Φ(D) has a hypercyclic algebra.

Q

= 06=k∈Z E1 ( kz ) has zero set (zn ) = (−1, 1, −2, 2, . . . )
Proof. Here Φ(z) =
(listed with multiplicity), which is of divergence type, and n(r) := #{n ∈ N :
|zn | ≤ r} satisfies that lim supr→∞ n(r)
r = 2 6= 0, so Φ has order one and positive
type, see [11, Theorem 2.10.3(a)]. Also Φ−1 (D) ⊃ N, and Φ′′ (0)Φ(0) 6= (Φ′ (0))2
2
since Φ(0) = 1, Φ′ (0) = 0 and Φ′′ (0) = π3 . So Φ(D) has a hypercyclic algebra by
Theorem 1.3.

Theorem 1.6 builds on the arguments used by Bayart in [3, Theorem 3.1].
Theorem 1.6. Let Φ be of exponential type. Suppose there exist complex scalars
z0 , z1 with z0 ∈ (0, z1 ) so that
(i)
|Φ| < 1 on (0, z0 ] and
(ii) |Φ(z1 )| > max{1, eτ0 |z1 | },
where
log |Φ(r |zz11 | )|

τ0 = τ0 (z1 ) = lim sup
.

r→∞
Then Φ(D) supports a hypercyclic algebra.
Remark 1.7.
(a) Every non-constant entire function Φ with |Φ(0)| = 1 satisfies condition
(i) in a strong way. Indeed if Φ(z) = a0 + an z n + o(z n ) with an 6= 0 and
n ≥ 1, then there exists a subdivision of the plane into 2n consecutive
sectors S0 , . . . , S2n−1 , each of angle nπ , so that for each k = 1, . . . , n we
have: On each ray lying in the interior of S2k−1 the function Φ has initially
modulus strictly smaller than one, and on each ray lying in the interior of
S2k the function Φ initially has modulus strictly larger than one, see [12,
pp 236–7].
(b) Notice that
(
0
if ρz1 < 1,
τ0 = τ0 (z1 ) =
h(Arg(z1 )) if ρz1 = 1, where
h = h(θ) = lim supt→∞ t−1 log |Φ(teiθ )| is the Phragmén-Lindelöf indicator
function of Φ and where ρz1 is the growth order of Φ in the direction of z1 ,
that is,
log log |Φ(t |zz11 | )|
.
ρz1 := lim sup
log t
t→∞
In particular, τ0 (z1 ) = 0 whenever Φ is of subexponential growth, and
Theorem 1.6 may be re-stated as follows:
“Let Φ be entire of exponential type, and let h be its PhragménLindelöf indicator function. Suppose there exist θ ∈ [0, 2π), and
positive scalars r, R so that
(
|Φ(teiθ )| < 1
for 0 < t < r, and

|Φ(Re )| > max{1, e

Then Φ(D) supports a hypercyclic algebra.”

Once a hypercyclic algebra is determined for a given operator, it is natural to ask
how large such an algebra can be. While the hypercyclic algebras for D obtained
in [17, 4] were singly generated and thus not dense in H(C), it was recently shown
that D and many other convolution operators support hypercyclic algebras that are
both dense and infinitely generated [14, 10, 6]. Moreover, for the case when |Φ(0)| <
1, the convolution operator Φ(D) supports a dense infinitely generated hypercyclic
algebra if and only if it is not a scalar multiple of an exponential function, see [3,
Theorem 6.3]. For the unimodular case we can say the following.
Theorem 1.8. Let Φ be a non-constant entire function of exponential type, with
N
|Φ(0)| = 1. Then the generic element f = (fn )∞
n=1 of H(C) freely generates a
dense hypercyclic algebra for Φ(D) in each of the following cases:
(a) Φ is of subexponential growth and min{n ∈ N : Φ(n) (0) 6= 0} is odd.
(b) Φ is of the form Φ(z) = eaz+b p(z) for some a, b ∈ C with a 6= 0 = Re(b)
and some non-constant polynomial p(z) = 1 + a1 z + a2 z 2 + · · · + ar z r with
a1 a−1 ∈ C \ R or with both 2a2 6= a21 and a1 + a 6= 0.  

For a statement to hold at a generic element of an F -space X we mean that it
holds at each element of a dense Gδ subset of X.
Remark 1.9. In the language of Lineability [1], Theorem 1.8 states in particular
that under each of the assumptions (a) − (c) the set of hypercyclic vectors of the
operator Φ(D) is densely strongly algebrable in the sense of Bartoszewicz and Gła̧b
[5], see also [10, Section 2]: A subset S of a commutative topological algebra X is
said to be densely strongly algebrable provided S ∪ {0} contains a dense subalgebra
of X that is induced by an infinite set of free generators.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we show Theorem 1.3. In Section 3
we show Theorem 1.6 and (all but Case (b)3(ii) of) Theorem 1.2 . In Section 4 we
show Theorem 1.8, which require stronger versions of Theorem 1.3 and Theorem 1.6
-Theorem 4.2 and Theorem 4.4, respectively- whose proofs are necessarily more
technical. A particular case of the former, Corollary 4.3, establishes the pending
Case (b)3(ii) of Theorem 1.2.
1.1. Notation and preliminaries. We recall that the order ρ of a constant entire
function is defined as zero, and for a given non-constant f ∈ H(C) it is given by ρ :=
M(r)
, where M (r) = Mf (r) = sup|z|≤r |f (z)|. When f has finite
lim supr→∞ log log
log r
order ρ, its type τ is given by τ := lim supr→∞ r−ρ log M (r). Following Boas [11],
we say that Φ is of growth (ρ, τ ) provided it is either of order less than ρ or, if of
order equal to ρ, it has type not exceeding τ . We also say that Φ is of subexponential
growth provided it is of growth (1, 0), and that Φ is of exponential
type provided
P∞
it is of growth (1, τ ) for some τ < ∞. An entire function Φ(z) = n=0 an z n is of
exponential type precisely when there exist constants C, R ∈ (1, ∞) so that |an | ≤
C RnP
(n ∈ N), and this holds precisely when the operator Φ(D) : H(C) → H(C),

f 7→ n=0 an Dn f , is well defined.

According to the Hadamard Factorization Theorem [11, Theorem 2.7.1], each
f ∈ H(C) of finite order ρ with zero set (zn ) listed with multiplicity and satisfying

2. Proof of Theorem 1.3
We show Theorem 1.3 by means of the following sufficient criteria for the existence of hypercyclic algebras.
Lemma 2.1. (Bayart and Matheron [4, Remark 8.26]) Let T be an operator on a
separable F -algebra X so that for each triple (U, V, W ) of non-empty open subsets
of X with 0 ∈ W and for each m ∈ N there exists f ∈ U and q ∈ N so that
(
T q (f j ) ∈ W
for 0 ≤ j < m,
(2.1)
q m
T (f ) ∈ V.
Then the generic element of X generates a hypercyclic algebra for T .
In order to apply Lemma 2.1 we first establish the next two lemmas.
Lemma 2.2. Let A1 , A2 be complex scalars, where A2 is non-zero. Then there
exists θ ∈ R so that

0 ≤ Re A1 eiθ
(2.2)

0 < Re A2 ei2θ .
Moreover, if A1 is also non-zero, then we may conclude both inequalities in (2.2)
to be strict.

Proof. If A1 = 0 the conclusion follows for example for θ = 21 Arg(A2 ). If A1 6= 0,
we may select θ from the following table, according to which quadrants A1 and A2
belong to.
For example, if both A1 and A2 lie in the first quadrant we may choose θ = 0.
If A1 and A2 are in the second and first quadrant respectively, then we may choose

θ = π + , that is, θ close to π and slightly larger than π. For the purpose of using
this table we understand the first quadrant QI to be given by
QI : = {z ∈ C : Re(z) > 0 and Im(z) ≥ 0},
and the remaining quadrants to be given similarly:
QII := {z ∈ C : Re(z) ≤ 0 and Im(z) > 0}
QIII := {z ∈ C : Re(z) < 0 and Im(z) ≤ 0}
QIV := {z ∈ C : Re(z) ≥ 0 and Im(z) < 0}.
The conclusion of the lemma now follows.

Lemma 2.3. Let Φ be entire and let w0 so that
(2.3)

Φ(w0 ) 6= 0

and

Φ′′ (w0 )Φ(w0 ) 6= Φ′ (w0 )2 .

Then we have:
(a) For each δ > 0 there exists w1 in D(w0 , δ) so that the function
[w0 , w1 ] → R, z 7→ log |Φ(z)|,
is strictly convex and log |Φ(z)| strictly increases as z moves from w0 to
w1 . That is, the function
t 7→ log |Φ((1 − t)w0 + tw1 )|,
is both strictly convex and strictly increasing on [0, 1].
(b) If in addition to (2.3) we also assume Φ′ (w0 ) 6= 0, then we may also
conclude that
t 7→ log |Φ((1 − t)w0 + tw1 )|
is both strictly increasing and strictly convex on [−1, 1].
Proof. Reducing δ > 0 if necessary, we may assume that Φ is zero-free on D(w0 , δ),
and thus that
Φ(z) = eh(z)

(2.4)

z ∈ D(w0 , δ)

for some h = h(z) holomorphic on D(w0 , δ). By our assumption we have
h′′ (w0 ) =

(2.5)

Φ′′ (w0 )Φ(w0 ) − Φ′ (w0 )2
6= 0,
Φ(w0 )2

so we can write
(2.6)

h(z) = a0 + a1 (z − w0 ) + a2 (z − w0 )2 + · · ·

(z ∈ D(w0 , δ)),

with a2 6= 0. By Lemma 2.2 we may choose θ ∈ R so that
(2.7)

Re(a1 eiθ ) ≥ 0 and Re(a2 ei2θ ) > 0.

Then the function

g : (−δ, δ) → R, g(t) = Re(h)(w0 + teiθ ) =

∞

Re(an einθ )tn ,

n=0

′′

is smooth and g (0) > 0 by our selection of θ. So g > 0 on some [−ρ, ρ] ⊂ (−δ, δ)
with ρ > 0 and since g ′ (0) = Re(a1 eiθ ) ≥ 0 there must exist η in (0, ρ) so that g is
strictly increasing on [0, η] as well. Hence
G : [0, 1] → R, G(t) := g(ηt)
is both strictly convex and strictly increasing on [0, 1]. But for w1 := w0 + ηeiθ we
have
G(t) = log |Φ(w0 + tηeiθ )| = log |Φ((1 − t)w0 + tw1 )|

(t ∈ [0, 1]),

and (a) holds. To show (b) we proceed similarly, noting that the new assumption
Φ′ (w0 ) 6= 0 gives that the expansion of h in (2.6) also satisfies a1 6= 0, and now the
angle θ can be chosen so that both points a1 eiθ and a2 ei2θ in (2.7) have strictly
positive real part, and thus the function g in (2.8) has strictly positive first and
second derivatives at the origin. Choosing ρ ∈ (0, δ) so that both g ′ and g ′′ are
strictly positive on [−ρ, ρ], the conclusion (b) now follows for w1 := w0 +ρeiθ , where
log |Φ((1 − t)w0 + tw1 )| = G(t) = g(ρt) for t ∈ [−1, 1] in this case.

We are now ready to show Theorem 1.3.
Proof of Theorem 1.3. Let U , V , and W be non-empty open subsets of H(C) with
0 ∈ W , and let m ≥ 2 be given. By Lemma 2.1 it suffices to find some (f, q) ∈ U ×N
so that
Φ(D)q (f m ) ∈ V and Φ(D)q (f j ) ∈ W (1 ≤ j < m).
Get w a non-zero scalar so that {w, 2w, . . . mw} ⊂ Φ−1 (D), and chose δ > 0 small
enough1 so that for each s ∈ {1, . . . , m} and w1 , . . . , ws ∈ D(w, δ) and for each
d ∈ {0, . . . , m − s} and v1 , . . . , vd ∈ D(0, δ) we have
(2.10)

w1 + · · · + ws + v1 + · · · + vd ∈ Φ−1 (D),

where the expression v1 + · · · + vd is defined as zero whenever d = 0. Now, by
Lemma 2.3 there exists a non-zero scalar w∗ in D(0, δ) so that the map
[0, w∗ ] → R, z 7→ log |Φ(z)|,
is strictly convex, and it increases with |z| whenever z ∈ [0, w0 ], for some w0 ∈
(0, w∗ ). Now, since the sets D(w, δ) and [ w20 , w0 ] have accumulation points in C
1To see why such δ > 0 exists: Let g : Cm → C, g(z , . . . , z ) := Φ(z + · · · + z ). By our
m

assumption, for each s ∈ {1, . . . , m} we have g(w, . . . , w, 0, . . . , 0) = Φ(sw) ∈ D. The continuity

of g ensures the existence of some δs > 0 so that

In particular, for each w1 , . . . , ws ∈ D(w, δs ) and v1 , . . . , vd ∈ D(0, δs ) with s + d ≤ m we have
Φ(w1 + · · · + ws + v1 + · · · + vd ) = g(w1 , . . . , ws , v1 , . . . , vd , 0, . . . , 0) ∈ D.
Then δ := min{ds : 1 ≤ s ≤ m} does the job.

(x1 , . . . , xp ) ∈ N0 let |x| := i∈Ip xi . Also, given x, y ∈ Np0 we let xy := i∈Ip xi yi .
Finally, for each n ∈ N we let Ln denote the set of tuples (u, v) in Np0 × Np0 for which
|u| + |v| = n. Our selection of ci ’s and λi ’s ensures that

Pending is to show that for each (u, v) ∈ L we have

Now, let (u, v) ∈ L be fixed. By (2.11) and (2.12) we have

So it suffices to verify that θu,v ∈ [0, 1). We have

three cases:
Case 1: (u, v) ∈ L∗m with |u| = 0. Here |v| = m and v ∈

θu,v = Q

thanks to the map z 7→ log |Φ(z)| being strictly convex on [0, w∗ ] and our
selection of the λi ’s.
Case 2: 1 ≤ |u| ≤ m and |v| ≤ m − |u|. By (2.10) we have αu + λv in Φ−1 (D). Also,
since |Φ(0)| = 1 and since z 7→ log |Φ(z)| strictly increases with |z| whenever
z ∈ [0, w0 ], we have that |Φ(mλi )| > 1 for each i ∈ Ip . So θu,v ∈ [0, 1).

The proof of Theorem 1.3. is now complete.

3. Proofs of Theorem 1.6 and Theorem 1.2.
We use the following result by Bayart to show Theorem 1.6.
Theorem 3.1. (Bayart) [3, pp 3452–3454] Let Φ be entire and of exponential
type. Suppose that for each m ≥ 2 there exist scalars z0 and w0 with z0 ∈ (0, w0 )
so that
(a) |Φ(w0 )| > 1 and |Φ| < 1 on (0, z0 ],
(b) |Φ(dw0 )| < |Φ(w0 )|d for each d ∈ {2, 3, . . . , m}, and
(c) The function t 7→ |Φ(w0 + tz0 )| is strictly increasing on [0, η), for some
η > 0.
Then Φ(D) supports a hypercyclic algebra on H(C).
We also use the following elementary fact:
Remark 3.2. Given f : [a, b] → R continuously differentiable and y ∈ (f (a), f (b)),
there exists c ∈ (a, b) so that y < f on [c, b] and f ′ (c) > 0.
Proof of Theorem 1.6. Fix m ≥ 2. By (i) and Theorem 3.1, it suffices to show that
there exists some w0 ∈ {tz0 : t > 1} so that
(a’) |Φ(w0 )| > 1,
(b’) |Φ(dw0 )| < |Φ(w0 )|d for each d ∈ {2, 3, . . . , m}, and
(c’) The function t 7→ |Φ(w0 +tz0 )| is strictly increasing on an interval3 (−η, η),
for some η > 0.
By means of contradiction, suppose no such w0 satisfies (a′ ) − (c′ ). Let t∗ > 1 so
that z1 = t∗ z0 . Also, consider the smooth function ψ : R → R, ψ(t) = |Φ(tz0 )|2 . By
(ii) we may pick 0 < ǫ < ψ(t∗ ) − max{1, e2τ0 |z1 | }. Also, let 14 > ǫ1 > ǫ2 > · · · > 0
so that
∞
Y
(1 − ǫk ) > 1 − ǫ.
k=1

By (ii) we have

ψ(1) < 1 ≤ max{1, e2τ0|z1 | } < ψ(t∗ ).
3While we only need [0, η) in (c’) for this proof, we later use in the proof of Theorem 4.4 this
stronger conclusion of having (−η, η) in (c’).

10

J. BÈS, R. ERNST, AND A. PRIETO

So by Remark 3.2 there exists t0 ∈ (1, t∗ ) so that
max{1, e2τ0 |z1 | } < ψ(t∗ ) − ǫ < ψ(t0 ).

(3.1)

0 < ψ ′ (t0 ).

In particular, 1 < ψ(t0 ) = |Φ(t0 z0 )|2 and ψ is strictly increasing on (t0 − η, t0 + η)
for some η > 0; in other words the function t 7→ |Φ((t + t0 )z0 )| = |Φ(t0 z0 + tz0 )| is
strictly increasing on (−η, η). That is, w0 := t0 z0 satisfies (a) and (c) and hence it
must fail (b) so for some d1 ∈ {2, . . . , m} we have
ψ(d1 t0 ) ≥ ψ(t0 )d1 > ψ(t0 )d1 (1−ǫ1 ) > ψ(t0 ).
By Remark 3.2, there exists t1 ∈ (t0 , d1 t0 ) so that
ψ(t0 )d1 (1−ǫ1 ) < ψ(t1 )

(3.2)

0 < ψ ′ (t1 ).

Let r1 ∈ (1, d1 ) so that t1 = r1 t0 . As before w0 := t1 z0 satisfies (a) and (c), so
there exists d2 ∈ {2, . . . , m} so that
ψ(d2 t1 ) ≥ ψ(t1 )d2 > ψ(t1 )d2 (1−ǫ2 ) > ψ(t0 )d1 (1−ǫ1 )d2 (1−ǫ2 ) > ψ(t0 ).
By Remark 3.2 there exists t2 ∈ (t1 , d2 t1 ) so that
ψ(t1 )d2 (1−ǫ2 ) < ψ(t2 )

(3.3)

0 < ψ ′ (t2 ).

We let r2 ∈ (1, d2 ) so that t2 = r2 t1 , and note again that w0 := t2 z0 satisfies (a)
and (c) to get d3 ∈ {2, . . . , m} with
ψ(d3 t2 ) ≥ ψ(t2 )d3 > ψ(t2 )d3 (1−ǫ3 ) > ψ(t2 ).
∞
Continuing this process inductively, we obtain sequences (tn )∞
n=1 , (dn )n=1 , and
∞
(rn )n=1 so that for each n ≥ 1 we have

dn ∈ {2, . . . , m}
rn ∈ (1, dn )
tn = rn tn−1

(3.4)

ψ(tn ) > ψ(tn−1 )dn (1−ǫn ) > ψ(t0 )(3/2)

n

ψ ′ (tn ) > 0.
In particular, ψ(tn ) → ∞ since ψ(t0 ) > 1, and thus tn →∞. Also, by (3.4) we have
tn = rn tn−1 = · · · = (rn rn−1 · · · r1 )t0 and

Corollary 3.3. Let Φ(z) = eaz ϕ(z),
where ϕ is non-constant of growth ( 12 , 0) with

|ϕ(0)| = 1, and Im a ϕ(0) ϕ′ (0) 6= 0. Then Φ(D) supports a hypercyclic algebra.
To show this we recall the following fact.

Lemma 3.4. [9, Lemma 5] Let Φ ∈ H(C) be of exponential type, and consider the
composition operator Cϕ : H(C) → H(C), f 7→ f ◦ ϕ, where ϕ : C → C, ϕ(z) = az,
is a homothety on the plane with 0 6= a ∈ C. Then Φa := Cϕ (Φ) is of exponential
type and
Cϕ (HC(Φa (D))) = HC(Φ(D)).
In particular, the algebra isomorphism Cϕ : H(C) → H(C) maps hypercyclic algebras of Φa (D) onto hypercyclic algebras of Φ(D).
Proof of Corollary 3.3. By Lemma 3.4 the convolution operator Φ(D) has the same
set of hypercyclic vectors as the one induced by
z
Φa−1 (z) = Φ( ) = ez ϕa−1 (z),
a
where ϕa−1 (z) = ϕ( az ). Notice that ϕa−1 is also of subexponential growth and that
it is of growth ( 21 , 0) whenever ϕ is, and that |Φa−1 | = |ϕa−1 | on the imaginary
axis. It suffices to show Φa−1 satisfies the assumptions
 of Theorem
 1.6. Letting
2
it 2
′
2
′
g(t) := |Φa−1 (it)| = |ϕ( a )| , we have g (0) = |a|2 Im a ϕ(0)ϕ (0) 6= 0 and thus

there exists some η > 0 so that Φa−1 has modulus smaller than one on (0, ηi) if
g ′ (0) < 0 or on (−ηi, 0) if g ′ (0) > 0. Also ϕa−1 is unbounded on any half line, since

it is of growth ( 21 , 0) [11, Theorem 3.1.5].

Then Φ(D) has a hypercyclic algebra.

Q∞
Proof. Condition (i) ensures that P (z) := n=1 (1 − zzn ) converges absolutely and
locally uniformly on C, and that P is of growth (1, 0) [11, Lemma 2.10.13]. Hence
Φ is non-constant of exponential type. By Lemma 3.4, replacing (zn ) by (azn )
if necessary, without loss of generality we may assume that a = 1. We show
that Φ(z) = ez P (z) satisfies the assumptions of Theorem 1.3. Notice first that
Φ′′ (0)Φ(0) 6= Φ′ (0)2 if and only
P ′′ (0)P (0) 6= P ′ (0)2 ,

and that P (0) = 1, P ′ (0) = − n=1 z1n , and P ′′ (0) = (− n=1 z1n )2 + n=1 z12 .
n
So (3.5) holds precisely when (ii) does. Finally, since P is of growth (1, 0) we have
limx→−∞ ex P (x) = 0, so Φ−1 (D) contains arithmetic progressions of the desired
form.

(3.5)

The case a = 0 of Corollary 3.5 is covered by Corollary 3.6.
Corollary 3.6. Let Φ ∈ H(C) be non-constant and of subexponential growth, with
|Φ(0)| = 1. Then Φ(D) has a hypercyclic algebra.
Proof. By Theorem 1.6 it suffices to show that there exist z1 ∈ C and 0 < δ < 1 so
that
(
|Φ| < 1 on (0, δz1 ]
(3.6)
|Φ(z1 )| > max{1, eτ0|z1 | },
where τ0 = τ0 (z1 ) = lim supr→∞ r−1 log |Φ(r |zz11 | )|.
constant, we may write
Φ(z) = Φ(0) + aN z N + o(Z N )

Since Φ ∈ H(C) is non-

(z → 0),

with N ≥ 1 and aN 6= 0. Notice also that for each A ∈ C \ {0} and each θ ∈ R we
have that Φ satisfies (3.6) for (z1 , δ, τ ) if and only if
e
Φ(z)
= eiθ Φ(Az)

e τe) = ( z1 , δ, |A|τ ). So taking θ ∈ R and A ∈ C of modulus
satisfies (3.6) for (e
z1 , δ,
A
one so that
eiθ Φ(0) = 1
eiθ aN AN < 0,
without loss of generality we may assume that
(3.7)

Φ(z) = 1 − az N + o(z N ) (z → 0)

where a > 0 and N ≥ 1. Since Φ is of growth (1, 0) it can’t be bounded on any
open half-plane. So there exists some z0 ∈ C with
Re(z0 ) > 0 and |Φ(z0 )| > 1.
2π

Now, for each 0 ≤ j < N let Φj (z) := Φ(wj z), where w := ei N . Notice that each Φj
is of growth (1, 0) and satisfies (3.7). Hence replacing Φ by Φj for some 0 ≤ j < N

if necessary, without loss of generality we may assume that Arg(z0 ) ∈ (− 2N

where g(t) = o(tN ) as t → 0. Now, let K be a closed disc centered at az0N and
contained in {z ∈ C : Re(z) > 0}. Then there exists δ > 0 so that for any 0 < s < δ
the set sK is contained in the open disc D(1, 1). Hence by (3.8) for each 0 < t < δ
we have |Φ(tz0 )| < 1. So z1 := z0 works, because by Remark 1.7(b) we have τ0 = 0,
as Φ is of subexponential growth.

Lemma 3.7. Let Φ(z) = p(z)ez , where p(z) = 1 + a1 z + a2 z 2 + · · · + ar z r , with
r ≥ 1 and ar 6= 0. Suppose that Im(a1 ) 6= 0 or that 2a2 6= a21 . Then Φ(D) supports
a hypercyclic algebra.
Proof. The case Im(a1 ) 6= 0 is immediate from Corollary 3.3. So assume that a1 ∈
R. We show that Φ satisfies the assumptions of Theorem 1.3. Since |Φ(x)| → 0 as
x → −∞, the set Φ−1 (D) contains an interval of the form (−∞, x], and in particular
the desired arithmetic progressions. But Φ(0) = 1 and Φ′′ (0)Φ(0) − Φ′ (0)2 =
2a2 − a21 6= 0.

Proof of Theorem 1.2. Conclusion (a) has been established in Corollary 3.6. So assume Φ is not of subexponential growth, that is, it has growth order one and positive
finite type. If Φ is zero-free it is a scalar multiple of an exponential and Conclusion
(b1) holds, see [2]. Conclusion (b2) follows from Lemma 3.4 and Lemma 3.7, noting
that the scalar a must be non-zero in this case as Φ is of order one. To show (b3),
consider the Hadamard factorization
Φ(z) = eaz P (z),

Q∞
of Φ, where P (z) = n=1 Ep ( zzn ) is the canonical product of genus p of the zero-set
(zn ) of Φ. Notice that p must be zero or one, since Φ has order one. Case (i), when
P

n=1 |zn | P< ∞, has been established in Corollary 3.5 as p = 0 in this case. Case

so P (0) = 1, P ′ (0) = 0, and P ′′ (0) = ∞

P (0)P (0) 6= P (0) , and equivalently that Φ′′ (0)Φ(0) 6= Φ′ (0)2 . Also, Φ′ (0) =

[11, Theorem 2.6.5], which is equal to 1, by (i). So Φ is of order at most 1, and

14

J. BÈS, R. ERNST, AND A. PRIETO

by (ii) and (iii) we may conclude Φ is of exponential type [11, Theorem 2.9.5 and
Theorem 2.10.1]. The conclusion follows from Theorem 1.2.

The following consequence of Theorem 1.2 complements [9, Corollary 14].

The conclusion now follows from Theorem 1.1 when |p(0)| < 1 and from the LeónMüller Theorem and Case (a) of Theorem 1.2 when |p(0)| = 1.

4. Proof of Theorem 1.8.
We note that the same arguments used in the proofs of Theorem 1.2, Theorem 1.3
and Theorem 1.6 give general eigenvalue criteria for the existence of hypercyclic
algebras. This general formulation was used by Bayart [3] to provide hypercyclic
algebras for operators on the space ℓ1 (N) endowed with the convolution product,
for instance. A criterion corresponding to Theorem 1.3, for example, may be stated
as follows.
Theorem 4.1. Let T be an operator on a separable infinite dimensional F -algebra
X. Suppose there exist a function E : C → X and an entire function φ : C → C
satisfying the following:
(a) For each λ ∈ C, T E(λ) = φ(λ)E(λ),
(b) For each λ, µ ∈ C, E(λ)E(µ) = E(λ + µ),
(c) For each subset Λ of C supporting an accumulation point in C, the set
{E(λ) : λ ∈ Λ} has dense linear span in X,
(d) The function φ satisfies |φ(0)| = 1, and φ′′ (0)φ(0) 6= φ′ (0)2 , and
(e) For each positive integer m there exists a non-zero scalar a = a(m) so that
{a, 2a, . . . , ma} ⊂ φ−1 (D).
Then the singly generated algebra induced by a generic element f of X is a hypercyclic algebra for T .
We adopt this point of view when providing with Theorem 4.2 and Theorem 4.4
below general eigenvalue criteria for the existence of dense hypercyclic algebras
induced by infinitely many free generators, and use such criteria to establish Theorem 1.8.
Theorem 4.2. Let X be a separable commutative F -algebra that supports a dense
freely generated subalgebra, and let T be an operator on X. Suppose there exist a
function E : C → X and an entire function φ : C → C satisfying the following:
(a) For each λ ∈ C, T E(λ) = φ(λ)E(λ),
(b) For each λ, µ ∈ C, E(λ)E(µ) = E(λ + µ),
(c) For each subset Λ of C supporting an accumulation point in C, the set
{E(λ) : λ ∈ Λ} has dense linear span in X, and
(d) The function φ satisfies |φ(0)| = 1, φ′′ (0)φ(0) 6= φ′ (0)2 , and φ′ (0) 6= 0.
N
Then the generic element f = (fn )∞
n=1 of X freely generates a dense subalgebra of
X consisiting entirely (but zero) of hypercyclic vectors for T .

15

Taking X = H(C), Φ = φ, T = Φ(D), and E(λ)(z) := eλz (λ, z ∈ C) in
Theorem 4.2 we have the following corollary.
Corollary 4.3. Let Φ be of exponential type satisfying |Φ(0)| = 1, Φ′′ (0)Φ(0) 6=
Φ′ (0)2 , and Φ′ (0) 6= 0. Then the set of hypercyclic vectors for Φ(D) is densely
strongly algebrable.
Theorem 4.4. Let X be a separable commutative F -algebra that supports a dense
freely generated subalgebra, and let T be an operator on X. Suppose there exist a
function E : C → X and an entire function φ : C → C with |φ(0)| = 1 satisfying
the following:
(a) For each λ ∈ C, T E(λ) = φ(λ)E(λ),
(b) For each λ, µ ∈ C, E(λ)E(µ) = E(λ + µ),
(c) For each subset Λ of C supporting an accumulation point in C, the set
{E(λ) : λ ∈ Λ} has dense linear span in X, and
(d) The integer min{n ∈ N : φ(n) (0) 6= 0} is odd and φ supports an angle
θ ∈ [0, 2π) and positive scalars r, R so that its Phragmén-Lindelöf indicator
1
function hφ (θ) := lim supt→∞ log |φ(teiθ )| t satisfies

|φ(teiθ )| < 1

N
Then the generic element f = (fn )∞
n=1 of X freely generates a dense subalgebra of
X consisting entirely (but zero) of hypercyclic vectors for T .

We postpone the technical proofs of Theorem 4.2 and Theorem 4.4 to the next
subsections and see first how to derive Theorem 1.8 from them.
Proof of Theorem 1.8. Case (a) follows from Theorem 4.4 and the proof of Corollary 3.6. The remaining cases follow from Corollary 4.3: By the León-Müller Theorem we may assume in such cases that b = 0. In Case (b) we have Φ(0) = 1,
Φ′′ (0)Φ(0) − Φ′ (0)2 = 2a2 − a21 6= 0,Qand Φ′ (0) = a1 + a 6= 0. For Case (c) we

have Φ(z) = ez P (z) where P (z) = n=1 Ep ( zzn ) with p ∈ {0, 1}. Φ(0) = 1 and
P∞
′′

Φ (0)Φ(0) 6= Φ (0) thanks to the assumption n=1 zn−2 6= 0. So it suffices to

0. We consider two

4.1. Proof of Theorem 4.2. We use the following fact established with [10,
Proposition 2.4, Lemma 2.10 and Lemma 3.1]:
Theorem 4.5. (B.,Papathanasiou [10]) Let X be a separable commutative F algebra that supports a dense freely generated subalgebra, and let T be an operator
on X. Suppose that for each integer N ≥ 2 and each non-empty finite subset A of
NN
0 not containing the zero N -tuple there exists β ∈ A satisfying:
(∗) “For each non-empty open subsets U1 , . . . , UN , V and W of X
with 0 ∈ W there exist f ∈ U1 × · · · × UN and n ∈ N so that
T n (f β ) ∈ V and T n (f α ) ∈ W for each α ∈ A \ {β}”.
N
Then the generic element f = (fn )∞
n=1 of X freely generates a dense subalgebra of
X consisting entirely (but zero) of hypercyclic vectors for T .

Lemma 4.6. ([10, Lemma 3.1]) Let A be a finite non-empty subset of NN

N ≥ 2. Then there exist positive scalars ki (i = 1, . . . , N ) so that the functional

Proof of Theorem 4.2. Let N ≥ 2 and let A be a non-empty finite subset of NN
0 not
containing the zero N -tuple. It suffices to show there exists some β in A satisfying
condition (∗) of Theorem 4.5. By Lemma 4.6 there exists k ∈ (0, ∞)N so that the
functional

assume that the subset
A1 := {α ∈ A : α1 = m}
of A is non-empty, where m := max{|α|∞ : α ∈ A}. Hence there exists β in A
with β1 = m at which the functional above attains its strict minimum over A1 .
Equivalently, each α in A \ {β} with α1 = m satisfies

Now, let U1 , . . . , UN , V and W be non-empty open subsets of X be given, with
0 ∈ W . It remains to show that there exists f in U1 × · · · × UN and a positive
integer n so that
T n (f β ) ∈ V
T n (f α ) ∈ W for each α ∈ A \ {β}.
By (d), taking w0 = 0 in Lemma 2.3(b) there exists some w ∈ C \ {0} so that
G : [−1, 1] → R, G(t) = log |φ(tw)|,
is strictly convex and strictly increasing. In particular, since |φ(0)| = 1 we know
PN
that G < 0 on [−1, 0) and G > 0 on (0, 1]. Now, let dA := max{ i=1 αi : α ∈ A},

Now, since each of Λ and Γ has accumulation points in C, condition (c) ensures that
there exist a positive integer p and non-zero scalars ai,j , bj , λi,j , γj with λi,j ∈ Λ,

Notice that cj = cj (n) → 0 as n → ∞, since |φ(mγj )| > 1. So letting
(
f1 = f1,n := L1 + Rn
fi = fi,n := Li + n1ki (2 ≤ i ≤ N ),
we have that f = (f1 , . . . fN ) ∈ U1 × · · · × UN whenever n is large enough. Now,

for each α in A let Iα denote the set of elements (u, v, ℓ) in (Np0 )N × Np0 × NN

Γ ⊂ φ−1 (D).

k=1

Since |φ(mγj )| > 1 for each 1 ≤ j ≤ p, we have Θu,v ∈ [0, 1) and by (4.8) we have
Xα (u, v, ℓ, n) → 0.
n→∞

Case 2: |u| = dA . So |v| = 0 in this case, and
λ·u+γ·v = γ·v ∈

Λ ∈ φ−1 (D)

k=1

by (4.2), and arguing as in Case 1 we have Xα (u, v, ℓ, n) → 0.
n→∞

Case 3: |u| = 0 and |v|∞ < m. In this case we have u1 = · · · = uN = 0, and
hence |v| = α1 < m and ℓi = αi for each 2 ≤ i ≤ N . Now, notice that

thanks to the strict convexity of t 7→ log |φ(tw)| on [−1, 1], and again by (4.8) we
have Xα (u, v, ℓ, n) → 0.
n→∞

Case 4: |u| = 0 and |v|∞ = m. Suppose first that v ∈
/ {me1 , . . . , mep }. Then
λ · u + γ · v = γ · v is a nontrivial convex combination of the points mγ1 , . . . , mγp
in [0, w], and again Θu,v ∈ [0, 1) thanks to the strict convexity of the map t 7→
log |φ(tw)| on [0, 1], so Xα (u, v, ℓ, n) → 0 by (4.8).
n→∞

Finally, suppose v = mej for some fixed j ∈ {1, . . . , p}. Here we have Θu,v = 1,
α1 = m, and ℓi = αi for each i ∈ {2, . . . , N }, as u1 = · · · = uN = 0. So by (4.4)

That is, (4.6) and (4.7) are satisfied, and the proof is now complete.

4.2. Proof of Theorem 4.4.
Proof of Theorem 4.4. Let N ≥ 2 and let A be a non-empty finite subset of NN
0
not containing the zero N -tuple. As in the proof of Theorem 4.2, we may assume
that the subset
A1 := {α ∈ A : α1 = m}
of A is non-empty, where m := max{|α|∞ : α ∈ A}, and that there exist k ∈
(0, ∞)N and β in A1 so that

for each α ∈ A1 . Now, let U1 , . . . , UN , V and W be non-empty open subsets of X
be given, with 0 ∈ W . By Theorem 4.5, it suffices to show that there exist f in
U1 × · · · × UN and a positive integer n so that
(4.10)

T n (f β ) ∈ V
T n (f α ) ∈ W for each α ∈ A \ {β}.

By (d) and Remark 1.7, as in the proof of Theorem 1.6 we may get w0 , z0 ∈ C with
w0 ∈ {tz0 : t > 1} so that
(i) |φ(w0 )| > 1 and |φ| < 1 on [−z0 , 0) ∪ (0, z0 ],
(ii) |φ(dw0 )| < |φ(w0 )|d for each d ∈ {2, . . . , m}, and
(iii) The map t 7→ |φ(w0 + tz0 )| is strictly increasing on (−1, 1).
Let γ1 ∈ (0, zm0 ) ∩ D(0, 1) close enough to zero so that
(i’)
1 < |φ(w0 + (m − 1)γ1 )|,
(ii’) for each d ∈ {2, . . . , m} and s ∈ {0, . . . , m − 2}
1

|φ(dw0 + sγ1 )| d < |φ(w0 + (m − 1)γ1 )|,

and

(iii’) the function t 7→ |φ(w0 + tγ1 )| is strictly increasing on the
interval (−dA − 1, dA + 1), where dA = maxα∈A |α|.
By (i′ ) and (ii′ ), there exists δ ∈ (0, 1) small enough so that
(1) 1 < |φ(λ + (m − 1)γ1 )| for each λ ∈ D(w0 , δ), and

20

(2) for each λ, λ′1 , . . . , λ′d in D(w0 , δ) and z in D(0, δ) and each

1

|φ(λ′1 + · · · + λ′d + sγ1 + z)| d < |φ(λ + (m − 1)γ1 )|.
Reducing δ > 0 if necessary, by (iii′ ) we may further assume that
(3) for each λ in (w0 − δγ1 , w0 + δγ1 ), the function
t 7→ |φ(λ + tγ1 )|
Let a1,1

Now, let η := min1≤j≤p |γ1,j |. Again by (c), there exist an integer q ≥ p and
non-zero scalars ai,j , γi,j ((i, j) ∈ {2, . . . , N } × {1, . . . , q}) with
η
(4.14)

so that

ai,j E(γi,j ) ∈ Ui (2 ≤ i ≤ N ).
(4.15)
Li :=
j=1

Enlarging p if necessary (and choosing some new γ1,j ’s in (η |γγ11 | , γR1 ) and corresponding small a1,j ’s in C \ {0} so that (4.13) is preserved), we may assume that
q = p. Next, for each positive integer n let

φ(λj + (m − 1)γ1 )n

Notice that cj = cj (n) → 0 as n → ∞, as |φ(λj + (m − 1)γ1)| > 1 by (1). So letting
(
f1 = f1,n := L1 + Rn
fi = fi,n := Li + n1ki (2 ≤ i ≤ N ),
we have that f = (f1 , . . . fN ) ∈ U1 × · · · × UN whenever n is large enough. Again,

(4.20)

Xα (u, v, ℓ, n) → 0
n→∞

except for the p elements (u, v, ℓ) of ∪α∈A Iα considered in (4.19). To this end, let
α ∈ A and let (u, v, ℓ) ∈ Iα be fixed, not of the form considered in (4.19). Notice

whenever Θu,v < 1. We consider the following cases:
Case 1: |v| = 0. So |u1 | = α1 − |v| = α1 in this case. If |u| = 0, then α1 = 0 and
ℓ = (αi )N
i=2 , and since A does not contain the zero N-tuple we must have ℓi = αi > 0
for some i ∈ {2, . . . , N }. Since |Φ(u · γ)| = |φ(0)| ≤ 1, by (4.21) and (4.9) we have

If |u1 | = 0, then by (4.14) we have u · γ = −tγ1 for some t ∈ [0, m − 1). Hence
by (3)
|φ(u · γ + v · λ)| < |φ(λk + (m − 1)γ1 )|,
giving Θu,v < 1. So assume that |u1 | > 0. Now, if u1,1 < m − 1, then by (4.11) and
(4.12)
u · γ + v · λ = λk + tγ1
for some t ∈ (0, m − 1), giving again by (3)
|φ(u · γ + v · λ)| < |φ(λk + (m − 1)γ1 )|,
and thus Θu,v < 1. Finally, if u1,1 = m − 1, then we must have α1 = m and
u1 = (m − 1)e1 . Here we have two possibilities: either |ui | > 0 for some 2 ≤ i ≤ N
or else |u2 | = · · · = |uN | = 0. In the former case we have by (4.11) and (4.12)
u · γ + v · λ = λk + tγ1
for some t ∈ (0, m − 1), giving Θu,v < 1. In the latter case we have ℓ = (αi )N
i=2 and
u · γ + v · λ = λk + (m − 1)γ1 , giving Θu,v = 1. Since (u, v, ℓ) is not of the form
considered in (4.19), then α 6= β. Hence by (4.21) and (4.9) we have
|Xα (u, v, ℓ, n)| ≤ K n
