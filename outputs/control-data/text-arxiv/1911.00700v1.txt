Abstract—The cavity is a fundamental ingredient of quantum
optical systems. This paper concerns the behavior of a quantum
cavity driven by non-classical field in single-photon state. To this
end, the number operator has been opted to reveal the number of
photons inside the cavity. Then, the quantum filtering equations
have been employed to derive a stochastic master equation for
the cavity which is driven by single-photon and is observed by
either Homodyne or photon-counting detector. Finally, the state
of the cavity has been estimated by the derived equations, and
the results have been compared with the conventional master
equation.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Nowadays, technologies based on quantum theory have
been realized and implemented as well as progressing rapidly
[1], [2]. Developing quantum control theory and practice is
preliminary to create quantum systems [3], [4]. Feedback
control based on measurements is an effective method which
is frequently employed. The Markovian feedback is denoted
to control laws which are a simple function of measures, and
the dynamical equation is given by the master equation (ME).
However, in many cases, the feedback law depends on an
estimation of the state, which is called Bayesian method [5].
The state estimation (filtering) is not only used in feedback
control but also disclose the behavior of quantum systems
which are not possible to find out directly without demolition
[6].
Quantum filtering (unraveling) was firstly founded by
Belavkin [7]. It is known as stochastic master equation (SME)
in quantum optic which represents the stochastic evolution of
system conditioned on measurements. The filtering framework
for a system driven by field in a vacuum, Gaussian, squeezed,
or coherent states are developed [8]. Also, filtering equation
for a quantum system which is driven by field in non-classical
states, particularly single-photon state, has been derived both
in [9], [10] and by considering a non-Markovian approach
in [11]. The filtering equation is also derived by assuming
detector efficiency and utilizing multiple measurements [12].
The fields in non-classical states including single-photon,
and the cavity are both fundamental components of photonic
quantum systems [13]. A single-photon has been experimentally generated by different methods, such as exploiting the

single-photon emission from natural and artificial atoms [14]
or utilizing correlated photon pairs in nonlinear crystals [15]
or entangled states [16]. Also, the behavior of a cavity has
been under attention [17].
This study concerns the dynamic of a cavity when it is
driven by field in single-photon state. The behavior of a cavity
can be investigated by the number of photons inside the cavity
in time. Thus, the number operator has been selected as a
system operator to estimate the number of photons inside
the cavity by using filtering equations. The filtering equation
has been derived for both Homodyne and photon-counting
measurements. The derived SME has been simulated, and the
results are compared with ME.
The paper has been folded as follows. The SLH representation of a cavity is presented in section II. In Section III,
quantum filtering of a system driven by field in single-photon
state is reviewed from literature. The filtering equations of a
cavity driven by a single-photon and observed by Homodyne
or photon-counting detector are derived in section IV. The
behavior of the cavity is simulated in section V. Finally, the
paper is concluded in section VI.
II. C AVITY M ODEL
The state of a quantum system is denoted by a ket |ψi
(typically a column complex vector in a Hilbert space) or
density operator ρ = |ψihψ| where the bra hψ| is the Hermitian
conjugate of the ket. Any measurable quantity (observable) of
a quantum system is associated with a hermitian operator X
which acts on the state space and results to a real physical
value [18].
Usually, unconditional evolution of density operator or
observable (ME) is given for quantum systems. If the joint
system state and field {system⊗field} denoted by ρsf =
ρ ⊗ ρf ield , then the system state is given by tracing (averaging) over the field. A field may be observed by homodyne
or photon-counting detector which gives a classical output
signal Y (t). SME for ρ or X [10] or stochastic Schrdinger
equation (SSE) for |ψi present estimated state conditioned
on measurements Y (t) [17]. The ME is obtained by classical
averaging over SME or SSE.
An optical cavity (or resonator) is a fundamental component
of optical systems which may be employed as a benchmark
to assess control algorithms in the quantum regime. It is an
arrangement of at least two mirrors that forms a standing wave.

Two facing mirrors is the most popular structure of optical
cavities.

The energy √
eigenstates are denoted
√ as |ni, n = 0, 1, 2, · · ·
where a|ni = n|n − 1i, a† |ni = n + 1|n + 1i, and a|0i =
0. The Hamiltonian of the cavity is given by H = ∆a† a where
∆ is the frequency detuning [19]. Overall, the cavity model
in SLH-framework gives [20]:

where S = I, L = κa, and H = ∆a† a are scattering matrix,

see Fig.1. The inter-cavity quantized field has creation and
annihilation operators a† and a, respectively, which adhere to
the commutation relation [a, a† ] = aa† − a† a = I where I is

Let a field in single-photon state |1ξ i drives a quantum
system G = (S, L, H). The reflected field is observed by a
detector (see Fig.2).
When the field is in the vacuum state, the quantum filtering
equation has been frequently utilized in researches [5]. However, when the field is in single-photon state, a source model
Gs for the field should be considered such that the total model
GT = G C Gs has a vacuum input [10]. The series product C
has been defined in [21]. The source model of a single-photon
|1ξ i with temporal shape ξt is [9], [10]:

Thus, The filtering equation in the case of a singlephoton input for any system operator X could be

IV. C AVITY EVOLUTION DRIVEN BY SINGLE - PHOTON
The behavior of a quantum system is studied through
observables. In particular, The behavior of a cavity could be

investigated by observing the number of photons in the cavity.
It is given by tracing over the number operator n = a† a as
Tr[ρ(t)n] in the Schrodinger picture or Tr[ρ(0)n(t)] in the
Heisenberg picture. So, by considering X = n, It is possible
to disclose the behavior of a cavity driven by fields in singlephoton state conditioned on Homodyne or photon-counting
measurements.
A. Homodyne Detection
Considering the Homodyne detector, we have:
Theorem 4.1: The number of photons inside a one-sided
cavity (3), which is driven by field in single-photon state
and conditioned on Homodyne measurements, evolves as:

√
κπt10 (a† )ξt }dt + { κπt11 (na + a† n) + πt01 (n)ξt∗ + πt10 (n)ξt − πt11 (n)Kt }dW

dπt10 (n) = {−κπt10 (n) − κπt00 (a)ξt∗ }dt + { κπt10 (na + a† n) + πt00 (n)ξt∗ − πt10 (n)Kt }dW
√
√
dπt01 (n) = {−κπt01 (n) − κπt00 (a† )ξt }dt + { κπt01 (na + a† n) + πt00 (n)ξt − πt01 (n)Kt }dW

where Kt = κπt11 (a + a† ) + πt01 (I)ξt∗ + πt10 (I)ξt .
Proof 4.1: The SME Eqs. 5 give the evolution of any system
operator X. So, we consider X = n and substitute S, L, and
H from Eq. (3) into Eq.5. The first term of Eq. (5) becomes:

Replacing

πtij (Ln)

For the term πtij (S † [X, L]) we have:
√
πtij (S † [X, L]) = πtij ( κ(na − an))
√
= πtij ( κ(a† aa − aa† a))

using commutation relation leads to
πtij (S † [X, L])

= −κπtij (a).

The other terms could be derived in the same way. Finally,
putting these term together leads to Eq. (7).
It could be seen that the first and higher order operators
in terms of a and a† as well as πt ij(I) are required in
Eqs. (7). Therefore, dynamical equations for these operators
must be derived. The complexity of stochastic equations for
higher-order operators, such as a† aa, increase by the order.
In simulations, the higher-order terms are usually neglected
by some rational assumptions. For instance, assuming the
cavity has no photon initially, and the input field is in singlephoton state lead to the fact that higher-order terms vanish.
The dynamical equations for creation, annihilation, and I are:

√
κπt01 (I)ξt∗ }dt + { κπt11 (n + a† a† ) + πt01 (a† )ξt∗ + πt10 (a† )ξt − πt11 (a† )Kt }dW

B. Photon Detection

The cavity has no photon initially. So, the higher-order
operators are vanishes.
We have πt01 (X) = πt10 (X † )† . Thus, πt10 (a† ) = πt01 (a)∗ ,
πt01 (a† ) = πt10 (a)∗ , and πt10 (I) = πt01 (I)∗ .
The initial conditions for any operator X are given by
πt01 (X) = πt10 (X) = 0 and πt11 (X) = πt00 (X) =
hη|X|ηi. As a result, πt01 (a) = πt10 (a) = πt01 (a† ) =
πt10 (a† ) = πt01 (n) = πt10 (n) = πt01 (I) = πt10 (I) = 0,
πt11 (a) = πt00 (a) = πt11 (a† ) = πt00 (a† ) = πt11 (n) =
πt00 (n) = 0, and πt11 (I) = πt00 (I) = 1.
As πt00 (n), πt00 (a), and πt00 (a† ) are equal to zero at
t = 0, then dπt00 (n) = 0, dπt00 (a) = 0, dπt10 (n) = 0,
dπt01 (n) = 0, and dπt00 (a† ) = 0.

Another point in regards of doing simulation is that presented
stochastic dynamical equations are in Ito representation while
the Stratonovich definition is easier to simulate numerically
due to normal rules of calculus do not apply to the Ito integral.
Also, SME is a stochastic process that multiple realizations (or
trajectories) could be simulated.

Let a single-photon has the shape:
√ − γ2 (t−tc )
ξt =
u(t − t0 )
γe

(10)

(11)

where γ is the decay rate of a two-level atom which emits this
photon and u(t − t0 ) is the Heaviside step function [17]. One
hundred different trajectories for the number of photons inside
a cavity driven by a single-photon Eq.(11) and observed by
Homodyne detector are depicted in Fig.3 for t0 = 3, κ = 0.1,
and ∆ = 0. An acceptable matching between the average of
trajectories and the ME can be seen. Also, the cavity may
excite to the |1i in some realizations. In addition, the cavity
with the larger decay rate, the faster emits the photons to the
bath. This phenomenon has been shown in Fig.4 by the ME
dynamics.
When a cavity is driven by a single-photon and is observed
by a photon-counting detector, the estimated state of the cavity
gradually goes from |0i to |1i. But, the estimated state will
collapse to |0i when a photon is observed by the detector. One
hundred different trajectories for this situation are displayed
in Fig. 5. A satisfactory match between average of different
trajectories and ME can be seen.
VI. C ONCLUSION
