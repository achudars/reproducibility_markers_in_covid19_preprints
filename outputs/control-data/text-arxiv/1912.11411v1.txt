Dual-wavelength mode-locked fiber laser and wavelength tunable mode-locked fiber laser
have emerged as a promising light source. However, there is few reports on generating these
two output from just one laser cavity. In this report, we demonstrate a dual-wavelength and
wavelength tunable mode-locked fiber laser output from one laser cavity by utilizing short
length Lyot filter. The central wavelengths of dual-wavelength mode-locked fiber laser are
1540 nm and 1564 nm and the tunable laser range is about 32 nm. We believe it could provide
a simple set-up for generating dual-wavelength and wavelength tunable mode-locked output
from one laser cavity.

Dual-wavelength mode-locked fiber laser output via one laser cavity is now attracting more
and more attention for the applications in dual-comb laser source, microwave generation and
Terahertz wave generation [1-4]. However, because of mode competition between different
wavelengths of the gain spectrum, dual-wavelength mode-locked fiber laser is hard to be
generated from laser cavity. In order to obtain dual-wavelength mode-locked fiber laser,
comb filters including sagnac loop filters, fiber Bragg gratings, Fabry-Perot filters etc. have
been inserted into the laser cavity to suppress the mode competition of erbium-doped fiber
(EDF) [5-7]. Commonly, the free spectrum range (FSR) of comb filters is too narrow to
obtain broad spacing dual-wavelength mode-locked fiber laser. In addition, X. Zhao et al.
inserted a programmable attenuator into laser cavity to give gain-tilt to balance two peaks of
EDF’s gain spectrum [8]. However, by just setting programmable attenuator to be a constant
loss is hard to generate stable dual-wavelength mode-locked fiber laser.
On the other hand, wavelength tunable mode-locked fiber lasers have been applied to
spectroscopy, optical communications, fiber-optics sensor and biomedical research [9-11].
There are various techniques to achieve wavelength tunable mode-locked laser such as
commercial band-pass filter (BPF), fiber Bragg grating etc [12-13]. However, the BPF has a
limited bandwidth and large insertion loss. In addition, the fiber Bragg grating is difficult to
fabricate and unstable. Recently, Lu et al. proposed an idea to insert 45° tilted fiber grating
(45°-TFG) with strong polarization dependent loss to achieve wavelength tunable modelocked fiber laser [14]. However, the insertion loss of the 45°-TFG is quite large, which
makes it hard to generate dual-wavelength mode-locked fiber laser output in the same cavity.
The Lyot filter which was invented by Bernard Lyot in 1933 is a kind of polarization
interference filter [15]. It can be used as comb filters because of the continuous wavelengthdependent transmission band in the spectra. The Lyot filters have found many applications
in spectral imaging [16-17], communication [18] and laser systems [19-22]. Fiber based Lyot
filter is commonly composed by a section of polarization maintaining fiber (PMF), a
polarization controller (PC) and a polarizer [23-24].
In this report, by choosing a length of 23 cm-long PMF to compose a short length Lyot
filter, dual-wavelength and wavelength tunable mode-locked fiber laser are obtained in one
laser cavity by adjusting PC. The central wavelengths of dual-wavelength are 1540 and 1564
nm. The range of wavelength tunable mode-locked fiber laser is from 1532 to 1564 nm,
which covers the gain spectrum of EDF.
By using Jones matrices, the transmission of Lyot filter is calculated to be written as [25]:

In this formula, Δn and L_PMF are the birefringence and length of PMF, respectively. θ is
the angle between the polarization direction of the input light and the fast axis of the PMF,
which can be tuned by adjusting the PC. Therefore, the FSR of Lyot filter can be expressed
as:
∆9 = 9$ (Δ5 ∗ -./0 )

(2)

The birefringence of PMF is around 3.47 × 10−4. From equation (2), the FSR of Lyot
filter is inversely proportional to the product of the birefringence and length of PMF. In order
to form a broad FSR Lyot filter, two solutions can be proposed. One is using lowbirefringence fiber such as bending long length single-mode fiber (SMF) which is reported
by our group [26]. The other way is reducing the length of PMF in Lyot filter. Compared
with using bending SMF, using short length PMF can make the total cavity length shorter,
which is beneficial for high repetition rate laser output.
Here, for obtaining around 30 nm spacing FSR Lyot filter, 23-cm long PMF is chosen. In
this way, the short-length Lyot filter is composed of 23-cm long PMF, a fiber-loop type PC
and a polarizer. The calculated transmission properties of short length Lyot filter are shown
in Fig. 1 (a) and (b) by changing the polarization angles and total birefringence, respectively.
In Fig. 1(a), different colors refer to the different polarization angles of PC while keeping
the total birefringence constant. This shows that by adjusting the PC, different transmission
curves can be achieved, which indicates that the short length Lyot filter can be used to give
gain-tilt to balance the two peaks of EDF’s gain. In a certain condition, broad spacing dualwavelength mode-locked fiber laser can be generated. In Fig. 1(b), different colors refer to
different total birefringence while setting the polarization angles unchanged. Because the
fiber inside the fiber-loop type PC is twisted and squeezed, the birefringence of it can be
changed slightly while adjusting the PC [27]. It is shown that the transmission peak’s
positions can be tuned by slightly changing the total cavity birefringence. In practice, by
rotating the PC, both polarization angle and total birefringence will be changed, which
indicates the transmission should be the combination of Fig. 1 (a) and (b) with peaks and
amplitude tuning function.
In order to observe the transmission property of Lyot filter, a test experiment is employed
as follow. A commercial erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) (AEDFA-PM-23-B-FA) is
used as input source and a 50/50 optical coupler (OC) is utilized to split the source into two
ways: one goes directly to optical spectrum analyzer (OSA) as reference while the other pass
through the short length Lyot filter first and then go to OSA as signal. By using signal
power to divide reference power, transmission property of short-length Lyot filter can be
3

observed. The detected transmission of short-length Lyot filter is shown in Fig. 1(c). Here,
different colors refer to different states of PC. The traces show different peak’s positions and
amplitudes, which indicates that this device can introduce gain-tilt to equalize the two peaks
of EDF’s gain spectrum and tune the central wavelengths of mode-locked laser.
The schematic of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 2. A 5 m-long erbium-doped
silica fiber (EDF) is used as the gain media with an estimated anomalous dispersion of ~-50
ps2/m at 1550 nm. The EDF is pumped through a 980/1550 wavelength-division
multiplexing (WDM) coupler in a forward-directional pumping scheme. An isolator (ISO)
is used to ensure a unidirectional operation. A carbon nanotube (CNT) solution which is
sprayed on the fiber end with the loss of 0.71 dB is inserted into the laser cavity as saturable
absorber material. The short length Lyot filter which is composed by a 23-cm long PMF, a
fiber-loop-type PC and a polarizer is utilized as wavelength selector to achieve dualwavelength and wavelength tunable mode-locked operation. A 20/80 OC is used as the
output coupler. A 13 m-long length of additional single-mode fiber (SMF) with an estimated
anomalous dispersion of ~17 ps2⁄m at 1550 nm are inserted between the WDM and the OC
for dispersion management. The pigtails of all the passive fiber components are made of
SMF. The total cavity length is approximately 30 m.
The optical spectrum, temporal waveform, RF spectrum and the autocorrelation trace of
the output are measured by an OSA (YOKOGAWA 6375), an oscilloscope (RIGOL
DS2202E), a RF spectrum analyzer (RIGOL DSA832) with a 5 GHz photo-detector (PD,
DET08CFC/M) and an autocorrelator (Femtochrome FR-103 XL) with a fiber-pigtailed
input, respectively.
It’s well-known that the EDF’s gain spectrum can hold two peaks under certain condition.
However, because of the mode competition between the two peaks, always only singlewavelength pulse can be obtained. Here, by inserting the short length Lyot filter whose
transmission can be tuned by adjusting the PC into the cavity, the mode competition can be
suppressed. The optical spectrum of dual-wavelength mode-locked fiber laser centers at
1540 and 1564 nm is shown in Fig. 3(a). There is one continuous wave (CW) component at
1564 nm pulse, which maybe because the mode-locked condition is not optimized at 1564
nm. The temporal waveform of dual-wavelength mode-locked fiber laser is displayed in Fig.
3(b). The repetition time of it is ~150 ns, which is consistent with the total cavity length of
30 m. The RF spectrum is shown in Fig. 3(c). The repetition rate is 6.38 MHz, which is also
consistent with the total cavity length. By zooming in the RF spectrum with the resolution
bandwidth (RBW) and video bandwidth (VBW) of 30 Hz, different repetition rates of these
4

two wavelengths pulse can be observed. The difference of them is ~300 Hz, which is due to
the group velocity dispersion (GVD) in the cavity. The repetition rate difference can be tuned
by changing the GVD in the laser cavity. The signal to noise ratio (SNR) of these two pulses
are 42 dB and 43 dB, which indicates that these two pulses have nearly the same intensity.
A tunable optical band-pass filter (BPF) (Alnair Labs BVF-200) which has a flat top
band is used to filter out one of the two wavelengths, with the pass band set at 1531 nm to
1549 nm (for 1540nm output) and 1556 nm to 1573 nm (for 1564 nm output), respectively.
The optical spectra and autocorrelation traces of the pulses at 1540 nm and 1556 nm can be
measured separately. As shown in the Fig. 6(a) and 6(b), the 1532 nm output pulse has a
spectral half-width of ~5 nm and an inferred full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) pulsewidth of 940 fs assuming a Gaussian waveform. Because the side wings of the pulse
spectrum are filtered out by the band-pass filter, the resulting spectrum resemble more like
a Gaussian shape rather than the original hyperbolic-sech shape. Also, as shown in the Fig.
6(c) and (d), the spectral half width and the inferred FWHM pulse-width of the 1556 nm
pulse component is 4.5 nm and 820 fs, respectively. The time-bandwidth products (TBPs)
for the 1532 nm and 1556 nm pulses are 0.504 and 0.457, respectively, which is slightly
larger than the transform-limited value of 0.441 assuming Gaussian waveforms. The reason
for the non-ideal TBP may be attributed to the the fact that part of the spectral component
was filtered out by the BPF. Moreover, because of the high loss induced by the band-pass
filter, the measured autocorrelation traces were measured at very low powers impacting the
accuracy of the autocorrelation pulse-width measurement.
The wavelength tunable ranging from 1532 to 1564 nm mode-locked fiber laser is shown
in Fig. 5. Because of the GVD in the laser cavity, the pulses at different wavelength operate
in slightly different Soliton regime. This truly changes the pulse shape of each pulse such as
Kelly sidebands. In addition, for the different states of PC, the amplitude of transmission
peaks will change, which introduces the different intensity of each pulse. From this figure,
32 nm tunable range which covers the whole gain bandwidth of EDF is observed. Because
the Lyot filter has a continuous wavelength-dependent transmission band in the spectra, it is
potentially to be applied with other gain medium such as thulium-doped fiber and ytterbiumdoped fiber.
In order to confirm the functionality of the short length Lyot filter, the PMF and polarizer
are removed from the cavity on purposely. Only single-wavelength mode-locked at 1560 nm
can be generated. This truly indicates that the short length Lyot filter is used to balance two
peaks of EDF’S gain spectrum and tune the central wavelength of single-wavelength mode5

locked laser. In addition, the stability of the dual-wavelength mode-locked fiber laser is
tested over 24 hours without any damage.
In summary, we demonstrate a dual-wavelength and wavelength tunable mode-locked
fiber laser emitted from one laser cavity using a Lyot filter which is composed of a 23 cmlong PMF, a polarizer and a PC. By adjusting the PC to tune the transmission property of
Lyot filter to give gain-tilt to balance the mode competition between two peaks of EDF’S
gain spectrum. Dual-wavelength pulse centers at 1540 and 1564 nm can be obtained. In
addition, adjusting the PC can change the birefringence of the fiber loop, which can slightly
tune the total birefringence of the Lyot filter. Wavelength tunable ranging from 1532 to 1564
nm mode-locked fiber laser can be achieved. We believe it may simplify the set-up for dualwavelength and wavelength tunable mode-locked fiber from one cavity. It is potentially to
be applied to dual-comb generation and fiber-optics sensors.
