Abstract
In this paper we show how the α-spectral radius changes under the
edge grafting operations on connected k-uniform hypergraphs. We characterize the extremal hypertree for α-spectral radius among k-uniform
non-caterpillar hypergraphs with given order, size and diameter. we also
characerize the second largest α-spectral radius among all k-uniform supertrees on n vertices by two methods.

Introduction

Spectral graph theory studies connections between combinatorial properties
of graphs and the eigenvalues of matrices associated to the graph, such as the
adjacency matrix, the Laplacian matrix and the signless Laplacian matrix. In
2017, the concept of Aα matrix of a graph G was put forward by Nikiforov [1]
which is hybrid of A(G) and D(G) similar to the signless Laplacian matrix,
where A(G), D(G) are the adjacency matrix and degree matrix of graph G,
respectively. The study of Aα matrix has started attracting attention of researchers recently (see [2–4]).
For positive integers n and k, a real tensor A = (ai1 i2 ···ik ) of order n and
dimension k refers to a multidimensional array (also called hypermatrix) with
entries ai1 i2 ···ik such that ai1 i2 ···ik ∈ R for all i1 , i2 , . . . , ik ∈ [n] := {1, 2, . . . , n}.
In 2005, Qi [5] introduced the definition of eigenvalues of a tensor. According
to the general product of tensors defined in [6], the eigenequation for tensor A

can be written in the following form:
Ax = λx[k−1] .
λ is called an eigenvalue of A , x is called an eigenvector of A corresponding to
T
the eigenvalue λ, where x[r−1] = x1r−1 , xr−1
, . . . , xnr−1 . The spectral radius
2
of A is the largest modulus of its eigenvalues, denoted by ρ(A).
Analogous to graph theory, adjacency tensors, Laplacian tensors, and signless Laplacian tensors have been introduced in hypergraph theory (see [7,8]).
The adjacency, Laplacian and signless Laplacian tensor of a uniform hypergraph has become the key subject in spectral hypergraph theory. For more
details, please refer to [9,10] and references therein. In [11], the conception of
α-spectrum of graph is generalized to hypergraphs.
The edge grafting operation for graphs was usually considered in the study
on graph variants (e.g. spectral radius, energy and so on).
In [2], Nikiforov and Rojo presented conjectures and question concerning
α-spectral radius and edge grafting operation on a simple graph.
Conjecture 1 (see [2] Conjecture 18, Conjecture 19). Let α ∈ [0, 1) and
s = 0, 1. If q ≥ 1 and p ≥ q + 2, then
ρα (Gp,s,q (u, v)) < ρα (Gp−1,s,q+1 (u, v)).
The conjecture is already confirmed by Guo in [12]. Furthermore, Guo in [4]
showed that Conjecture 1 also holds for connected k-uniform hypergraph when
s = 0.
Question 1. (see [2] Problem 20 ) For which connected graphs G the following
statement is true:
Let α ∈ [0, 1) and let u and v be non-adjacent vertices of G of degree at least
2. If q ≥ 1 and p ≥ q + 2, then ρα (Gp,q (u, v)) < ρα (Gp−1,q+1 (u, v)).
The above statement is confirmed true by Lin in [3] for the type of graphs
Gp,s,q (u, v) when p − q ≥ max{s + 1, 2}. In this paper, we show the statement
also true for connected k-uniform hypergraph.
A supertree is a hypergraph which is both connected and acyclic. A supertree
is called a caterpillar if the removal of all pendant edges results in a loose path.
Otherwise, it is called a non-caterpillar. Let N C(m) denote the set of k-uniform
non-hyper-caterpillars with m edges. Let C(m, d) and N C(m, d) denote, respectively, the set of k-uniform hyper-caterpillars and non-hyper-caterpillars with
m edges and diameter d. It is easy to see that if N C(m, d) is nonempty, then
m ≥ 6 and 4 ≤ d ≤ m − 2.
The spectral radii of k-uniform supertrees have been studied by many authors (see [3,13,14]). In [15,16], Yuan et al. determined the top ten supertrees
with the maximum spectral radii. And in [4], Guo et al. determined the
unique non-hyper-caterpillar with maximum adjacency spectral radius among
2
N C(m, d). They use the relationship ρ(Gk ) = ρ k (G). But up to now, we have

2

not found the relationship between ρα (G) and ρα (Gk ). So we should use another
new methods to research ρα (Gk ).
Note that the supertrees with the first ten largest spectral radii are caterpillar
supertrees. It is natural to ask that:
(a). Whether those supertrees also are supertrees with the maximum α-spectral
radius;
(b). Which non-caterpillar supertrees have the maximum adjacency spectral or
α-spectral radius.
The remaining of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, notations
and some definitions about tensors and hypergraphs are given. In Section 3,
applying the results about the perturbation of spectral radii of the hypergraph
under moving edges and 2-switching operations, we present a generalization of
the result related to Conjecture 1 reported in [4]. In Section 4, we determine
the k-uniform non-caterpillar supertrees on n vertices in N C(m, d) with the
first two largest Aα spectral radii in N C(m, d) and N C(m). In Section 5, we
characterize the supertree with the second largest α-spectral radius among all
k-uniform supertrees on n vertices.

Preliminaries

Firstly, we introduce some notations and conceptions used in this paper.
Throughout this paper, we focus on simple k-uniform hypergraphs with
k ≥ 3. A k-uniform hypergraph H = (V (H), E(H)) consists of the vertex
set V (H) (a finite set) and the edge set E(H) which is a collection of k-subsets
of V (H).
For a subset U ⊂ V (H), we denote by EH [S] the set of edges {e ∈ E(H)|S ∩
e 6= ∅}. For a vertex i ∈ V (H), we simplify EH [i] as EH (i). It is the set of edges
containing the vertex i, i.e., EH (i) = {e ∈ E(H)|i ∈ e}. The cardinality |EH (i)|
of the set EH (i) is defined as the degree of the vertex i, which is denoted by
degH (i), we simplify degH (i) by dH (i) or di . A vertex of degree one is called a
pendant vertex, otherwise it is called non-pendant vertex. A vertex with degree
3 or greater is called a branching vertex. A hyperedge e is called pendant edge
if all vertices of e, except at most one, are of degree one. A hyperedge e is called
branching edge if there are at lease three vertices with degree 2 or greater in e.
Let G = (V, E) be a simple graph. The k-th power hypergraph of G is the
k-uniform hypergraph resulting from adding k − 2 new vertices to each edge of
G. (see [17])
The k-th power of an ordinary tree was called a k-uniform hypertree in [17].
It is clear that any k-uniform hypertree is a supertree.
If |ei ∩ ej | ∈ {0, s} for all edges ei 6= ej of a hypergraph G, then G is
called an s-hypergraph. A simple graph is a 2-uniform 1-hypergraph. Note
that 1-hypergraphs here are also called linear hypergraphs [18]. So, all power
hypergraphs are linear hypergraph. And a supertree is a linear hypergraphs;

3

otherwise, if two edges e1 , e2 have two vertices v1 , v2 in common, then v1 e1 v2 e2 v1
is a cycle.
According to [10, p. 146], a loose path (or linear path) P of length d is a
hypergraph with distinct edges e1 , e2 , . . . , ed such that:
(
1, if |i − j| = 1,
|ei ∩ ej | =
0, otherwise.
If ei−1 ∩ ei = {vi } for i = 1, . . . , d − 1 and v0 ∈ e1 \{v1 }, vd ∈ ed \{vd−1 }, the
aforementioned loose path is denoted by v0 e1 v1 e2 . . . ed vd or Pd for brevity. It
is easy to see that a loose path with d edges is the k-th power of the ordinary
path with d edges.
Let P is a loose path from u to v in H. If degH (u), degH (v) ≥ 3 and
degH (w) = degP (w) for any w ∈ V (P)\{u, v}, P is called an internal path of H.
If degH (u) ≥ 3 and degH (w) = degP (w) for any w ∈ V (P)\{u}, P is called a
pendant path of H on vertex u.
For X ⊂ V (G) and y ∈ V (G)\X, the distance between X and y, denoted by
dG (y, X) = min{dG (y, x)|x ∈ X}, the distance dG (X, Y ) = min{dG (x, y)|x ∈
X, y ∈ Y }.

Definition 3.1 ( [7]). The adjacency tensor A(G) = (ai1 ...ik ) of a k-uniform
hypergraph G is defined to be a k-th order n dimensional non-negative tensor
with entries ai1 ...ik such that

otherwise.
Definition 3.2 ( [11]). For 0 ≤ α < 1, the Aα tensor of a k-uniform hypergraph
G with V (G) = {v1 , v2 , . . . , vn } is defined as follows:
Aα (G) = αD(G) + (1 − α)A(G).
Where D(G) is the degree tensor of G, which is a n-dimensional diagonal tensor,
with the i-th diagonal entry as the degree of vertex vi .
The definition of Aα tensor of hypergraph can be viewed as a generalization
of adjacency tensor and signless Laplacian tensor of hypergraph. Obviously,
A(G) = A0 (G) and Q(G) = 2A 21 (G).
For connected hypergraph G, the Aα tensor of G always weakly irreducible
nonnegative and symmetric tensor. According to Perron-Frobenius Theorem
of tensor, Aα has aPunique positive eigenvector x corresponding to the spectral
n
radius ρ(Aα ) with i=1 xki = 1. We say that ρ(Aα ) is the α-spectral radius of G,
4

denoted by ρα (G). Such a positive eigenvector is called the principal eigenvector
of Aα . For more details of the Perron-Frobenius Theorem on nonnegative tensor,
see [10, Chapter 3] and references therein.

of order k and dimension n, denote Rn+ = {x ∈ Rn |x ≥ 0}. Then we have

Theorem 3.2. (see [4]) For k ≥ 2, let G be a k-uniform hypergraph with
u, v1 , . . . , vr ∈ V (G) and e1 , . . . , er ∈ E(G) for r ≥ 1 such that u ∈
/ ei and
vi ∈ ei for i = 1, . . . , r, where v1 , . . . , vr are not necessarily distinct. Let e0i =
(ei \{vi }) ∪ {u} for i = 1, . . . , r. Suppose that e0i ∈
/ E(G) for i = 1, . . . , r. Let
G0 = G − {e1 , . . . , er } + {e01 , . . . , e0r }. Let x be the α-Perron vector of G. If
xu ≥ max{xv1 , . . . , xvr }, then ρα (G0 ) > ρα (G).
Corollary 3.1. Let u1 , u2 are non-pendant vertices in an edge of connected
uniform hypergraph H with |EH (ui )\EH ({u1 , u2 })| ≥ 1 for i = 1, 2. Let H 0 be
the hypergraph obtained from H by moving edges EH (u2 )\EH ({u1 , u2 }) from u2
to u1 and H  H 0 , then
ρα (H) < ρα (H 0 ).
Proof. Let H 00 be the hypergraph obtained from
EH (u1 )\EH ({u1 , u2 }) from u1 to u2 . Moreover, H 0
that either xu1 ≥ xu2 or xu2 ≥ xu1 holds, thus either
conditions of Theorem 3.2. So we can apply Theorem
max{ρα (H 0 ), ρα (H 00 )} = ρα (H 0 ).

The generalization of edge grafting theorem
for hypergraph on Aα spectral radius

Consider a connected k-uniform hypergraph G with two vertices (not necessarily distinct) u, v ∈ V (G). Let Gu,v (p, q) be the hypergraph obtained by
attaching the pendant hyperpaths Pp to u and Pq to v (See Fig. 1).
For non-negative integers a, b, c, d with a + b = c + d, we say that the graph
Gu,v (c, d) is obtained from Gu,v (a, b) by an edge grafting operation on the two
relevant pendant paths of Gu,v (a, b). The edge grafting operation for graphs
was usually considered in the study on graph variants.
The 2-switch operation is a useful tool for study in graph theory, especially
in terms of degree sequence. In [4,16], the perturbation of the adjacency spectral
radius and α-spectral radius of a hypergraph under 2-switch operation is studied.
Definition 4.1 (2-switching operation, see [16]). Let e1 , e2 be two edges of kuniform hypergraph G = (V, E). If U1 , U2 are r-subsets of e1 , e2 respectively
with 1 ≤ r < k and k-sets e01 = (e1 ∪ U2 )\U1 , e02 = (e2 ∪ U1 )\U2 ∈
/ E(G).
Let E 0 = (E ∪ {e01 , e02 })\{e1 , e2 }. Then we say that hypergraph G0 = (V, E 0 ) is

It is clear that the degrees of the vertices remain unchanged when a 2-switch
is applied to a hypergraph. The following theorem illustrates the effect of 2switch operation on the α-spectral radius of hypergraph.
Theorem 4.1. Let G be a connected k-uniform hypergraph and e, f ∈ E(G).
Let U1 ⊂ e, U2 = e\U1 , V1 ⊂ f, V2 = f \V1 with 1 ≤ |U1 | = |V1 | ≤ k − 1. Suppose
that e0 = U1 ∪ V2 and f 0 = V1 ∪ U2 are k-subsets of V (G) and not in E(G).
Let G0 = G − {e, f } + {e0 , f 0 }. Let x be the principal eigenvector of Aα (G). If
xU1 ≥ xV1 and xU2 ≤ xV2 , then ρα (G) ≤ ρα (G0 ). Moreover, the equality holds
iff xU2 = xV2 and xU1 = xV1 .

Proof. By Theorem 3.1 and Formula (2), we have
ρα (G0 ) − ρα (G)

=k(1 − α)(xU1 − xV1 )(xV2 − xU2 )

So, ρα (G) ≤ ρα (G0 ).

Since ρα (G) ≤ ρα (G0 ), we have Aα (G0 )x ≥ Aα (G)x and the equality holds
iff ρα (G) = ρα (G0 ).
By Perron-Frobenious Theorem x is positive vector. Then from Formula
(4), we have ρα (G) = ρα (G0 ) if and only if xU1 = xV1 , xU2 = xV2 .
The following corollaries can be derived from Theorem 4.1.
Corollary 4.1 ( [4]). Let G be a connected k-uniform hypergraph with k ≥ 2,
and e and f be two edges of G with e ∩ f = ∅. Let x be the principal eigenvector
of Aα (G). Let U ⊂ e and V ⊂ f with 1 ≤ |U | = |V | ≤ k − 1. Let e0 = U ∪ (f \V )
and f 0 = V ∪ (e\U ). Suppose that e0 , f 0 ∈
/ E(G). Let G0 = G − {e, f } + {e0 , f 0 }.
If xU ≥ xV , xe\U ≤ xf \V and one is strict, then ρα (G) < ρα (G0 ).
Corollary 4.2. Let G be a connected k-uniform hypergraph and x be the principal eigenvector of Aα (G). Suppose that e, f ∈ E(G) such that
{u1 , u2 } ⊂ e, {v1 , v2 } ⊂ f and xu1 > xv1 , xu2 ≤ xv2 .
If ui is not adjacent to vj in G for any i, j ∈ {1, 2}, then there exist k-subsets
e0 , f 0 of V (G) with {u1 , v2 } ⊂ e0 , {u2 , v1 } ⊂ f 0 such that:
ρα (G) < ρα (G0 ),
where G0 = G − {e, f } + {e0 , f 0 }.
Proof. Let
(
e ∪ {v2 }\{u2 }
e =
f ∪ {u1 }\{v1 }
0

if xe\{u1 ,u2 } ≥ xf \{v1 ,v2 } ,
otherwise;

and

(
0

f =

f ∪ {u2 }\{v2 }
e ∪ {v1 }\{u1 }

if xe\{u1 ,u2 } ≥ xf \{v1 ,v2 } ,
otherwise.

If xe\{u1 ,u2 } ≥ xf \{v1 ,v2 } , then take
U1 = e\{u2 }, U2 = {u2 },

V1 = f \{v2 }, V2 = {v2 }.

If xe\{u1 ,u2 } < xf \{v1 ,v2 } , then take
U1 = {u1 }, U2 = e\{u1 },

V1 = {v1 }, V2 = f \{v1 }.

In either case, we always have
e = U1 ∪ U2 , f = V1 ∪ V2 , e0 = U1 ∪ V2 , f 0 = V1 ∪ U2
and
xU1 > xV1 , xU2 ≤ xV2 .

Since ui is not adjacent to vj in G for any i, j ∈ {1, 2}, we have e0 , f 0 ∈
/ E(G).
Take G0 = G−{e, f }+{e0 , f 0 }. From Theorem 4.1, we have ρα (G0 ) > ρα (G).
The Corollary 4.2 is a key ingredient of the proof of main results.
Lemma 4.1. Let ue1 u1 . . . up ep+1 up+1 and vf1 v1 . . . vq−2 fq−1 vq−1 be two pendant paths in Gu,v (p + 1, q − 1) at u and v, respectively. Let x be the principal
eigenvector of Aα (Gu,v (p + 1, q − 1)). If ρα (Gu,v (p, q)) ≤ ρα (Gu,v (p + 1, q − 1)),
then xup−i > xvq−i−1 for i = 0, . . . , q − 1, where u0 = u, v0 = v.
Proof. Assume, by contradiction, that there exists some i ∈ {0, 1, . . . , q − 1}
such that xup−i ≤ xvq−i−1 . Let j be the smallest number of them.
When j = 0, let H be the k-uniform hypergraph obtained from Gu,v (p +
1, q − 1) by moving ep+1 from up to vq−1 . Since H ∼
= Gu,v (p, q), we have
ρα (Gu,v (p, q)) = ρα (H) > ρα (Gu,v (p+1, q−1)) by Theorem 3.2, a contradiction.
When j ≥ 1, we have xup−j ≤ xvq−j−1 and xup−j+1 > xvq−j .
According to Corollary 4.2, there exist e0 , f 0 such that
{vq−j−1 , up−j+1 } ⊂ e0 , {up−j , vq−j } ⊂ f 0 and ρα (Gu,v (p + 1, q − 1)) < ρα (G0 ),
where G0 = G − {ep−j+1 , fq−j } + {e0 , f 0 } ∼
= Gu,v (p, q). This contradicts the
condition ρα (Gu,v (p, q)) ≤ ρα (Gu,v (p + 1, q − 1)).
Theorem 4.2. Let u, v be two non-pendant vertices of hypergraph G. If there
exist an internal path P with s length in hypergraph Gu,v (p, q) for any p ≥ q ≥ 1,
then we have
ρα (Gu,v (p + 1, q − 1)) < ρα (Gu,v (p, q))

for p − q + 1 ≥ s ≥ 0.

Proof. On the contradiction, we assume there exists some positive integers p, q
with p − q + 1 ≥ s ≥ 0 such that
ρα (Gu,v (p, q)) ≤ ρα (Gu,v (p + 1, q − 1)).
8

(5)

Let Q = w0 m1 w1 . . . ws−1 ms ws be the internal path of Gu,v (p + 1, q − 1)
with w0 = v and ws = u. Let H be the k-uniform hypergraph obtained from
Gu,v (p+1, q−1) by moving EG (v)\{m1 } from v to up−q+1 when s ≥ 1 or moving
EG (v) from v to up−q+1 when s = 0. Let x, x0 be the principal eigenvectors of
Aα (Gu,v (p + 1, q − 1)), Aα (H), respectively.
Under the assumption (5), we have xup−i > xvq−i−1 for i = 0, . . . , q − 1 from
Lemma 4.1. Thus xup−q+1 > xv . By Theorem 3.2, we have
ρα (H) > ρα (Gu,v (p + 1, q − 1)).

(6)

Then p − q + 1 > s > 1 holds. Otherwise, we have s = p − q + 1 or s = 0, then
both cases H ∼
= Gu,v (p, q). So
ρα (Gu,v (p, q)) > ρα (Gu,v (p + 1, q − 1)),
which contradicts to the assumption (5).
Furthermore, we have the following claim.
Claim: x0wi < x0up−q+1−i for 0 ≤ i ≤ s.
Proof. Assume for contradiction that there exist some i ≥ 0 such that x0wi ≥
x0up−q+1−i . Let j be the smallest number of them. Then we have j > 0. Otherwise, since w0 = v, x0up−q+1 ≤ x0v , ρα (H) < ρα (Gu,v (p + 1, q − 1)) holds from
Theorem 3.2. This contradicts the formula (6).
Herefore, j > 0 and x0wj ≥ x0up−q+1−j , x0wj−1 < x0up−q+2−j .
According to Corollary 4.2, there exist e0 , m0 such that
{wj , up−q+2−j } ⊂ e0 , {wj−1 , up−q+1−j } ⊂ m0 and ρα (H) < ρα (G0 ),
where G0 = H − {mj , ep−q+1−j } + {e0 , m0 } ∼
= Gu,v (p, q). By Formula (6), we
have ρα (Gu,v (p + 1, q − 1)) < ρα (H) < Gu,v (p, q).
This contradicts the assumption (5).

e be the k-uniform hypergraph obtained from H by moving EG (u)\ms
Let G
e∼
from u to up−q+1−s . Then G
= Gu,v (p, q). From Claim, x0u = x0ws < x0up−q+1−s .
So
e > ρα (H) > ρα (Gu,v (p + 1, q − 1))
ρα (Gu,v (p, q)) = ρα (G)
follows from Theorem 3.2 and Formula (6), also a contradiction.
Therefore, ρα (Gu,v (p, q)) > ρα (Gu,v (p + 1, q − 1)).
Let G be a connected k-uniform hypergraph and u ∈ V (G), let Gu (p, q) be
the graph obtained by attaching the paths Pp and Pq to u.
From Theorem 4.2, we have the following corollary which reported in [4]
Corollary 4.3 ( [4]). For k ≥ 2, let G be a connected k-uniform hypergraph
with |E(G)| ≥ 1 and u ∈ V (G). For p ≥ q ≥ 1 and 0 ≤ α < 1, we have
ρα (Gu (p, q)) > ρα (Gu (p + 1, q − 1)).
Theorem 4.3. Let G be a connected uniform hypergraph and u, v be two pendant
vertices in a pendant edge e of G. If p ≥ q ≥ 1, then
ρα (Gu,v (p, q)) > ρα (Gu,v (p + 1, q − 1)).
9

Proof. On the contradiction, we assume that
ρα (Gu,v (p, q)) ≤ ρα (Gu,v (p + 1, q − 1)).

(7)

As mentioned in Lemma 4.1, let ue1 u1 . . . up ep+1 up+1 and vf1 v1 . . . vq−2 fq−1 vq−1
be the pendant paths in Gu,v (p + 1, q − 1) at u and v, respectively. Then by
Lemma 4.1, we have xup−i > xvq−i−1 for i = 0, . . . , q − 1. Thus xup−q+1 > xv .
Suppose
e = {u, v, w1 , w2 , . . . , wk−2 }
and
0
ep−q+1 = {up−q , up−q+1 , w10 , w20 , . . . , wk−2
}.

We have xw1 > xw10 . Otherwise, take G0 be hypergraph obtained from
Gu,v (p + 1, q − 1) by moving all the edges incident with w1 except e from w1 to
w10 . By Theorem 3.2 and the fact that G0 ∼
= Gu,v (p, q), we have
ρα (Gu,v (p, q)) > ρα (Gu,v (p + 1, q − 1)), a contradiction.
According to Corollary 4.2, there exists e0 , f 0 such that
{w1 , up−q+1 } ⊂ e0 , {w10 , v} ⊂ f 0
and
ρα (Gu,v (p, q)) = ρα (H 0 ) > ρα (Gu,v (p + 1, q − 1)),

where H 0 = G − {ep−q+1 , e} + {e0 , f 0 }. This contradicts the assumption (7).

Figure 3: The hypertrees H1 (m, d) and H2 (m, d) (where i = d d2 e + 1)
In [20], Guo and Zhou investigated the adjacency spectral radius of uniform
hypertrees and showed that H1 (m, d) be the unique non-hyper-caterpillar with
maximum spectral radius among N C(m, d). Next we determine the supertrees
with the first two largest α-spectral radius among N C(m, d).
Lemma 5.1. For any G ∈ N C(m, d), there exists some G0 ∈ C(m, d) with
ρα (G0 ) > ρα (G).
Proof. Let P = v1 e1 v2 . . . vd ed vd+1 be a diametral path of G.
Let u ∈ V (G) be the farthest vertex from P. Clearly, this distance is at least
2 (otherwise, G ∈ C(m, d)). Let r ∈ V (P) and Q = uf1 vf2 w . . . r be the shortest
path from u to P. Take G1 to be the k-uniform supertree obtained from G by
moving all edges containing v except f2 from v to w. Obviously, G1  G. Then
by Corollary 3.1, we have ρα (G) < ρα (G1 ). Repeating this procedure, we arrive
at a hyper-caterpillar G0 with ρα (G) < ρα (G0 ). This completes the proof.
Definition 5.1. Let G be a k-uniform linear hypergraph with k ≥ 3. Let e =
{v1 , . . . , vk } be an edge of G with dG (vi ) ≥ 2 for i = 1, . . . , r, and dG (vi ) = 1
for i = r + 1, . . . , k, where 3 ≤ r ≤ k. Let G0 be the hypergraph obtained from
G by moving all edges containing v3 , . . . , vr except e from v3 , . . . , vr to v1 . We
say G0 is obtained from G by Operation I.
Theorem 5.1. (see [4]) If G0 is obtained from G by Operation I, then we have
ρα (G0 ) > ρα (G).
Let G be a family of linear hypergraphs which is invariable under Operation
I, namely, for any G ∈ G, the hypergraph obtained from G by Operation I also
in G.
Lemma 5.2. Let H with maximum α-spectral radius among G, then H is a
power hypergraph.
11

Proof. If H is not a power hypergraph, then there is an edge f with at least
three vertices of degree at least 2, and by Operation I we can get a hypergraph
H 0 . Obviously, H 0 ∈ G and by Theorem 5.1, we have ρα (H 0 ) > ρα (H), a
contradiction. Therefore, H is a power hypergraph.
Theorem 5.2. Let G ∈ N C(m, d), then we have
ρα (G) ≤ max{ρα (H1 (m, d)), ρα (H2 (m, d))}.
Equality holds if and only if G ∼
= H1 (m, d) or G ∼
= H2 (m, d).
Proof. Let G with maximum α-spectral radius among N C(m, d). Let x be the
principal eigenvector of Aα (G). Let P = v1 e1 v2 . . . vd ed vd+1 be the diametral
path of G. From N C(m, d) ⊆ G and Lemma 5.2, we have G is a k-uniform
power hypertree.
Claim 1. ∀v ∈ V (G), d(v, P) ≤ 2.
proof. Assume to the contrary, ∃u ∈ V (G), d(u, P) = d(u, r) ≥ 3, r ∈ V (P).
Let Q = uf1 vf2 w . . . r be the shortest path from u to P. Let G0 be the k-uniform
power hypertree obtained from G by moving all edges containing v except f2
from v to w. Obviously, G0 ∈ N C(m, d) and G0  G. Then by Corollary 3.1,
we have ρα (G0 ) > ρα (G), a contradiction. Thus ∀v ∈ V (G), d(v, P) ≤ 2.

Claim 2. There only exists a vertex vi with d(vi ) ≥ 3, 2 ≤ i ≤ d.
proof. Suppose that there are two vertices vj and vs with d(vj ), d(vs ) ≥ 3 (2 ≤
j, s ≤ d) on P. Without loss of generality, assume that xvj ≥ xvs . Let G0 be the
hypertree obtained from G by moving all edges containing vs except es−1 and es
from vs to vj . Obviously, G0 ∈ N C(m, d). By Theorem 3.2, ρα (G0 ) > ρα (G), a
contradiction. Thus there only exists a vertex vi with d(vi ) ≥ 3, 2 ≤ i ≤ d. 
Claim 3. There exists exactly one vertex v ∈ V (G\P) with d(v) ≥ 2.
proof. From the definition of non-caterpillar supertrees, we have that there must
exist vertex v ∈ V (G\P) with d(v) ≥ 2. Assume to the contrary, there exists
vertices u, v ∈ V (G\P) with d(u), d(v) ≥ 2. Without loss of generality, assume
that xu ≥ xv . Let G0 be the hypertree obtained from G by moving all pendant
edges containing v from v to u. Obviously, G0 ∈ N C(m, d). By Theorem 3.2,
ρα (G0 ) > ρα (G), a contradiction. Thus there exists exactly one vertex v ∈
V (G\P) with d(v) ≥ 2.

Suppose that there are l pendant edges in G and t pendant edges attached
on the diametral path P. From above claims and Theorem 3.2, G must be some
k
graph Ts,t;a,b
with s = l − t − 2 > 0, a ≥ 2, b ≥ 2 and a + b = d. Otherwise,
we can relocate some pendant edge attached on the diametral path such that the
resulting graph G0 ∈ N C(m, d) and ρα (G) < ρα (G0 ), a contradiction. For the
k
k
same reason, G must be one of Ts+t,0;a,b
and T1,s+t−1;a,b
.
Furthermore, by Corollary 4.3, we have G ∼
= H1 (m, d) or G ∼
= H2 (m, d).
Otherwise, by grafting edges on the diametral path, we can get some G0 ∈
N C(m, d) with ρα (G) < ρα (G0 ), a contradiction. This completes the proof.

According to [4], Guo et al. determined the unique non-hyper-caterpillar
with maximum adjacency spectral radius among N C(m). So Guo et al. confirmed (b) for the adjacency spectral and in the following theorem, we determine
the supertrees with the first two largest α-spectral radius among N C(m). And
we confirm (b) for the α-spectral radius.
Theorem 5.3. If G ∈ N C(m) and 0 ≤ α < 1, then
ρα (G) ≤ max{ρα (H1 (m, 4)), ρα (H2 (m, 4))}.
Equality holds if and only if G ∼
= H1 (m, 4) or G ∼
= H2 (m, 4).
Proof. Let G with maximum α-spectral radius among N C(m). Let x be the
principal eigenvector of Aα (G). Then by Theorem 5.2, G ∼
= H1 (m, d) or G ∼
=
H2 (m, d) for some d with 4 ≤ d ≤ m − 2. Suppose that d ≥ 5. Let P =
v1 e1 v2 . . . vd ed vd+1 be a diametral path of G. Choose vt , vt+1 ∈ {v2 , v3 , . . . , vd },
without loss of generality, assume that xvt ≥ xvt+1 . Let G0 be the hypertree
obtained from G by moving all edges containing vt+1 except et from vt+1 to
vt . Obviously, G0 ∈ N C(m). By Theorem 3.2, we have ρα (G) < ρα (G0 ), a
contradiction. It follows that d = 4, i.e., G ∼
= H1 (m, 4) or G ∼
= H2 (m, 4).
We finish this section with the following conjectures:
Conjecture 5.1. For G ∈ N C(m, d) and 0 ≤ α < 1, then
ρα (G) ≤ ρα (H1 (m, d)).
Equality holds if and only if G ∼
= H1 (m, d).
Conjecture 5.2. For G ∈ N C(m) and 0 ≤ α < 1, then
ρα (G) ≤ ρα (H1 (m, 4)).
Equality holds if and only if G ∼
= H1 (m, 4).

The second largest α-spectral radius of k-uniform
supertrees

In this section, we will characterize the supertree with the second largest
α-spectral radius among all k-uniform supertrees on n vertices by two methods.
In [13], Li and Shao showed that for the adjacency spectral radius, the signless
Laplacian spectral radius and the incidence Q-spectral radius, S k (1, m − 2) attains uniquely the second largest spectral radius among all k-uniform supertrees
on n vertices and m edges. In [4], Guo and Zhou determined the hypergraph
with the largest α-spectral radius among all k-uniform supertrees on n vertices.
Theorem 6.1. (see [4]) Suppose that k ≥ 2. If G is a k-uniform supertree with
k
m ≥ 1 edges, then ρα (G) ≤ ρα (K1,m
) for 0 ≤ α < 1 with equality holds if and
k
∼
only if G = K1,m .
13

Let T be the set of k-uniform supertrees of order n. Let N2 (G) be the
number of non-pendant vertices of a hypergraph G. Denote by Ti the set of
supertrees in T with N2 (T) = i.
Lemma 6.1. Let T ∈ Ti+1 (n, k) be a k-uniform supertree of order n with
N2 (T ) = i + 1 ≥ 2. Then there exists a supertree T 0 ∈ Ti (n, k) such that
ρα (T 0 ) > ρα (T ).
Proof. Let u, v be two non-pendant vertices of T . Let P = ue1 . . . es v be a
shortest path from u to v. Let T1 be the hypergraph obtained from T by moving
all the edges incident with u (except e1 ) from u to v, and T2 be obtained from
T by moving all the edges incident with v (except es ) from v to u. Then both
T1 and T2 are still supertrees (since they are still connected and have the same
number of edges as T ), and they all have one more pendant vertex than T .
So we have N2 (Tj ) = N2 (T ) − 1 = i(j = 1, 2), note that Tj ∈ Ti (n, k) (j =
1, 2), and xu ≥ xv or xv ≥ xu . Then by Theorem 3.2 , we have ρα (T ) <
max{ρα (T1 ), ρα (T2 )}. Take T 0 to be one of T1 and T2 with the larger spectral
radius, we obtain the desired result.
Lemma 6.2. Let a, b, c, d be nonnegative integers with a + b = c + d. Suppose
that a ≤ b, c ≤ d and a < c, then we have:
ρα (S k (a, b)) > ρα (S k (c, d)).
Proof. Let u, v be the two non-pendant vertices of S k (c, d) with the degrees
d(u) = c + 1 and d(v) = d + 1. Let G0 be obtained from S k (c, d) by moving c − a
pendant edges from u to v, and G00 be obtained from S k (c, d) by moving d − a
pendant edges from v to u. Then both G0 and G00 are isomorphic to S k (a, b).
Here xu ≥ xv or xv ≥ xu , by Theorem 3.2, we have
ρα (S k (a, b)) = max(ρα (G0 ), ρα (G00 )) > ρα (S k (c, d)).

Theorem 6.2. Let T be a k-uniform supertree on n vertices with m edges,
k
suppose that T  K1,m
, then we have
ρα (T ) ≤ ρα (S k (1, m − 2))
where the equality holds if and only if T ∼
= S k (1, m − 2).
Proof. (Methods one)
We use induction on the number of non-pendant vertices N2 (T ). Since T 
k
K1,m
, we have N2 (T ) ≥ 2. Now we assume that T  S k (1, m − 2).
If N2 (T ) = 2, then the two non-pendant vertices u and v of T must be
adjacent. Otherwise, all the internal vertices of the path between u and v would
be non-pendant vertices other than u and v, contradicting N2 (T ) = 2. And so
it can be easily verified that T ∼
= S k (c, d) for some positive integers 2 ≤ c ≤ d
14

with c + d = m − 1 (2 ≤ c since T  S k (1, m − 2)). So by Lemma 6.2, we get
the desired results.
If N2 (T ) ≥ 3, then by Lemma 6.1, there exists a supertree T 0 ∈ Ti−1 (n, k)
such that ρα (T 0 ) > ρα (T ). Repeating this procedure, we arrive at a T 00 ∈
T2 (n, k) such that ρα (T ) < ρα (T 00 ) ≤ ρα (S k (1, m − 2)). This completes the
proof.
Proof. (Methods two)
Let T be a k-uniform supertree with maximum α-spectral radius among kk
uniform supertrees on n vertices with m edges except the hyperstar K1,m
.
k
Let d be the diameter of T . Since T  K1,m
, we have d ≥ 3. Suppose
that d ≥ 4. Let v0 e1 v1 . . . ed vd be a diametral path of T . Choose vt , vt+1 ∈
{v1 , . . . , vd−1 }, without loss of generality, assume that xvt ≥ xvt+1 . Let T1 be
the k-uniform supertree obtained from T by moving the edges incident vt+1
k
except et from vt+1 to vt . Obviously, T1  K1,m
. By Theorem 3.2, we have
ρα (T ) < ρα (T1 ), a contradiction. Thus d = 3 and T ∼
= S k (c, d). By Lemma 6.2,
k
∼
we have T = S (1, m − 2).
Corollary 6.1. S k (1, m − 2) is the unique supertree which achieves the second
maximum spectral radius among all k-uniform supertree on n vertices with m
edges.
By this point, we give a positive answer to Question (a): the supertrees with
the first two largest spectral radii also are supertrees with the first two largest
α- spectral radii.
