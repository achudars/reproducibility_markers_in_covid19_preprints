PRIMITIVE EQUATIONS WITH HORIZONTAL VISCOSITY:
THE INITIAL VALUE AND THE TIME-PERIODIC PROBLEM
FOR PHYSICAL BOUNDARY CONDITIONS
AMRU HUSSEIN, MARTIN SAAL, AND MARC WRONA
Abstract. The 3D-primitive equations with only horizontal viscosity are considered on a cylindrical domain Ω = (−h, h) × G, G ⊂ R2 smooth, with the
physical Dirichlet boundary conditions on the sides. Instead of considering a
vanishing vertical viscosity limit, we apply a direct approach which in particular avoids unnecessary boundary conditions on top and bottom. For the initial
value problem, we obtain existence and uniqueness of local z-weak solutions
for initial data in H 1 ((−h, h), L2 (G)) and local strong solutions for initial data
in H 1 (Ω). If v0 ∈ H 1 ((−h, h), L2 (G)), ∂z v0 ∈ Lq (Ω) for q > 2, then the zweak solution regularizes instantaneously and thus extends to a global strong
solution. This goes beyond the global well-posedness result by Cao, Li and
Titi (J. Func. Anal. 272(11): 4606-4641, 2017) for initial data near H 1 in the
periodic setting. For the time-periodic problem, existence and uniqueness of
z-weak and strong time periodic solutions is proven for small forces. Since this
is a model with hyperbolic and parabolic features for which classical results
are not directly applicable, such results for the time-periodic problem even for
small forces are not self-evident.

1. Introduction and main results
The 3D-primitive equations are one of the fundamental models for geophysical
ﬂows, and they are used for describing oceanic and atmospheric dynamics. They
are derived from the Navier-Stokes equations assuming a hydrostatic balance. The
subject of this work are the initial value and time-periodic problem for the primitive
equations with only horizontal viscosity and the physical lateral Dirichlet boundary
conditions.
The motivation to study this problem is that in many geophysical models the
horizontal viscosity is considered to be dominant and the vertical viscosity is neglected. From the analytical point of view such models with only partial viscosity
terms are also very interesting since they combine features of both parabolic diﬀusion equations in horizontal directions represented by the term −∆H and hyperbolic
transport equations in vertical direction represented by the term w∂z v, compare
(1.2) below. Roughly speaking, one thus expects that regularity is preserved in the
vertical direction while it is smoothed in the horizontal directions. Following this
intuition allows us to identify classes of initial data for which this problem is locally
or even globally well-posed.

Many forces acting on geophysical ﬂows such as the attraction by the moon,
which becomes visible in the falling and rising tides, are time-periodic. Moreover,
in some models the wind is described as a perturbation of a periodic function. A
time-periodic force adds in each period energy to the system, and since there is only
partial viscosity it is not self-evident whether the system remains stable enough to
have time-periodic solutions. However, it turns out that at least for forces being
small over one period of time, there are unique small time-periodic solutions.
This work is part of the third author’s PhD thesis [37], and therein some of the
computations are elaborated in more detail.
1.1. Primitive equations with only horizontal viscosity. To be precise, here
time intervals (0, T ) for T ∈ (0, ∞) and a cylindrical domain Ω are considered,
(1.1)

Ω := (−h, h) × G ⊂ R3 ,

for

h>0

and a smooth domain G ⊂ R2 ,

where the boundary ∂Ω decomposes into a lateral, upper and bottom part
Γl := ∂G × [−h, h],

Γu := G × {+h},

Γb := G × {−h}.

The primitive equations describe the velocity u = (v, w) : Ω → R3 and the pressure
p : Ω → R of a ﬂuid, where v = (v1 , v2 ) denotes the horizontal components and w
stands for the vertical one. The primitive equations with horizontal viscosity are

∂t v + v · ∇H v + w∂z v − ∆H v + ∇H p = f,
in Ω × (0, T ),



∂z p = 0,
in Ω × (0, T ),
(1.2)
divH v + ∂z w = 0,
in Ω × (0, T ),



v(t = 0) = v0 , in Ω
which are supplemented by the boundary conditions
(1.3)

v=0

on Γl × (0, T ) and w = 0

on Γu ∪ Γb × (0, T ).

The ﬁrst boundary condition is a lateral no-slip boundary condition and the latter
is due to the divergence free condition div u = 0 and ν · u = 0 for the outer
normal derivative ν on ∂Ω. Here, x, y ∈ G are the horizontal coordinates and
z ∈ (−h, h) the vertical coordinate, ∇H = (∂x , ∂y )T , divH = ∇H ∗ and ∆H =
∂x2 + ∂y2 denote the horizontal gradient, divergence and Laplacian, respectively and
v · ∇H = v1 ∂x + v2 ∂y . Note, that for the primitive equations the nonlinear term
w∂z v is stronger compared to the nonlinearity of the Navier-Stokes equation since
w = w(v) given by (2.2) below involves ﬁrst order derivatives, while the pressure
here is only two-dimensional.
For simplicity we have formulated the equations without the Coriolis force, but
being a zero order term it does not alter the well-posedness results discussed here.
Moreover, we consider only the velocity equation without temperature or salinity
focusing on the mathematical diﬃculties. The general anisotropic primitive equations are given if one replaces in (1.2) the term ∆H by ν1 ∆H + ν2 ∂zz for horizontal
viscosity ν1 ≥ 0 and vertical viscosity ν2 ≥ 0. Here, physical constants are normalized to one, thus we consider the case ν1 = 1 and ν2 = 0.
1.2. Previous results. Cao, Li and Titi, see [5,6], have been the ﬁrst to study the
primitive equations with only horizontal viscosity analytically. They tackled this
problem in a periodical setting by considering a vanishing vertical viscosity limit,
i.e.,
−∆H − ε∂z2

for ε → 0,

and by this strategy they obtained remarkable global strong well-posedness results
for the initial value problem for initial data with regularity near H 1 (Ω), and local
well-posedness for initial data in H 1 (Ω). Recently, the second author [30] applied
a more direct approach considering the system without vanishing viscosity limit.
Thereby local well-posedness results even for less partial viscosities has been proven,
and for only horizontal viscosity unnecessary boundary conditions on bottom and
top have been avoided.
Note that for the Navier-Stokes equations with only horizontal viscosity there
are also some local well-posedness results, cf. [1, Chapter 6].
The mathematical analysis of the initial value problem for the primitive equations with full viscosity, i.e., with viscosity term ν1 ∆H + ν2 ∂zz where ν1 , ν2 > 0,
has been started by Lions, Temam and Wang [22–24] which launched a lot of activity in the analysis of these equations. In diﬀerence to the 3D Navier-Stokes
equations the primitive equations are known to be time-global well-posed for initial data in H 1 (Ω) by the breakthrough result of Cao and Titi [7], see also [19]
for diﬀerent boundary conditions and non-cylindrical domains. Reﬁnements of this
include global well-posendess for initial data with v0 , ∂z v0 ∈ L2 (Ω), see [17], or
v0 ∈ L1 ((−h, h), L∞ (G)), see [12].
For the inviscid 3D-primitive equations, i.e., ν1 = ν2 = 0, blow-up results are
known by Wong [36], see also [4], and there are ill-posedness results for Sobolev
spaces by Han-Kwan and Nguyen [16]. Local well-posedness has been proven only
for analytical data by Kukavica et al. [18]. The primitive equations with partial
viscosity are an intermediate model between these well- and ill-posed situations.
For more information on previous results on the primitive equations we refer
to the works of Washington and Parkinson [35], Pedlosky [28], Majda [26] and
Vallis [34]; see also the recent surveys by Li and Titi [21] and by Hieber and the
ﬁrst author [13].
1.3. Main results and discussion. Our main results are stated in the following.
Below, the notions of weak and z-weak solutions are made precise in Deﬁnitions 2.1
and 2.2, where function spaces are introduced in Subsection 2.1.
Theorem 1.1 (Local solutions for the initial value problem).
(a) Let f ∈ L2 ((0, T ), H 1 ((−h, h), H −1 (G))2 ) and v0 ∈ H 1 ((−h, h), L2 (G))2
with divH v0 = 0. Then there exists a time T ′ ∈ (0, T ] and a unique z-weak
solution to the initial boundary value problem (1.2), (1.3) on (0, T ′ ), i.e., a
weak solution with
vz ∈ L∞ ((0, T ′ ), L2 (Ω)2 ), ∇H vz ∈ L2 ((0, T ′ ), L2 (Ω)2×2 ),

and this z-weak solution satisfies v ∈ C 0 ([0, T ′ ], L2 (Ω)2 ). One has T ′ =
T if kv0 kH 1 ((−h,h),L2 (Ω)) and kf kL2 ((0,T ),H 1 ((−h,h),H −1 (G))) are sufficiently
small.
(b) If v0 ∈ H 1 (Ω)2 with v0 (·, z)|∂G = 0 for almost all z ∈ (−h, h), divH v0 = 0,
and f ∈ L2 ((0, T ), H 1 ((−h, h), L2 (G))2 ), then there exists a time T ′ ∈
(0, T ] and a unique strong solution to (1.2), (1.3) on (0, T ′ ), i.e. a z-weak
solution where in addition
∇H v ∈ L∞ ((0, T ), L2 (Ω)2×2 ),

∆H v, ∂t v ∈ L2 ((0, T ), L2 (Ω)2 ).

For kv0 kH 1 and kf kL2 ((0,T ),H 1 ((−h,h),L2 (G))) sufficiently small, one has
T′ = T.

Remark 1.2. Continuous dependence on the data can be proven as well by adapting the estimates obtained in the proof of Theorem 1.1.
Theorem 1.3 (Global solutions for the initial value problem).
(a) Let v0 ∈ Hη1 (Ω)2 with v0 (·, z)|∂G = 0 for almost all z ∈ (−h, h), divH v0 = 0
and f ≡ 0, where
Hη1 (Ω) := {v : kv0 kHη1 = kv0 kH 1 + k∂z v0 k2+η + kv0 k∞ < ∞},

for some η > 0, then there exists a unique global strong solution to (1.2),
(1.3) on (0, T ) for any T > 0. Moreover,
Z T

sup (k∇vk2 + k∂z vk2+η ) +
k∇H ∇vk22 ≤ Cη,h,T (kv0 kHη1 ),
t∈[0,T ]

for an increasing function Cη,h,T depending on η, h, T .
(b) Let v0 ∈ H 1 ((−h, h), L2 (G)2 ) with ∂z v0 ∈ L2+η (Ω)2 for η > 0 with divH v0 =
0 and f ≡ 0. Then the unique z-weak solution from Theorem 1.1 (a) extends to a unique global strong solution to (1.2), (1.3) on (0, T ) for any
T > 0. Moreover, for any δ ∈ (0, T )
Z T
sup (k∇vk22 + k∂z vk2+η
)
+
k∇H ∇vk22 ≤ CT,h,δ,v0
2+η
t∈[δ,T ]

δ

for a constant CT,h,δ,v0 , depending on T, h, δ, v0.
Note that the regularity of the initial value in Theorem 1.1 (a) is similar to the
one obtained for the Navier-Stokes equation with horizontal viscosity, compare [1,
Theorem 6.2]. It is also the same condition obtained by Ju for the existence and
uniqueness of global z-weak solutions for the primitive equations with full viscosity,
see [17].
Theorem 1.1 (b) and Theorem 1.3 (a) correspond to the result by Cao, Li and
Titi in [6, Theorem 1.1]. However, they consider a cubical domain with periodic
boundary conditions in all three directions. As already pointed out in [30], vertical
boundary conditions are not necessary, but they are preserved by the equation.
Here, we consider the more physical Dirichlet boundary conditions on the sides and
no boundary condition on top and bottom.
The proof of the a priori bounds in [6] uses a vanishing vertical viscosity limit.
Here, we follow a more direct approach considering the case of horizontal viscosity
without such limits. For the global a priori bound, we have been able to adapt
the overall strategy of Cao, Li and Titi, but due to the boundary conditions here,
controlling the pressure terms becomes more involved. Note also that in [6] the
a priori bound is proven for periodic boundary conditions in all three directions,
here we do not require any boundary conditions on the top and bottom part of the
boundary.
Moreover, using that regularity is preserved in the vertical directions while being
smoothed in the horizontal directions, we show in Theorem 1.3 (b) that a z-weak
solution with slightly more integrability of the initial data regularizes to reach the
setting of Theorem 1.3 (a) for t > 0. Thus existence and uniqueness of global strong
solutions holds even for a larger class of initial conditions. It is remarkable that
the regularity of the initial conditions required in 1.3 (b) is very close to the one
obtained by Ju for the case of full viscosity, cf. [17].

Furthermore, for the local well-posedness results a force term is included here
which allows us to analyze the time-periodic problem. The notion of T -periodic
z-weak solutions is explained in Deﬁnition 2.3 below.
Theorem 1.4 (Time-periodic problem). There exists ε > 0 such that
(a) if f ∈ L2 ((0, T ), H 1 ((−h, h), H −1 (G))2 ) and kf kL2((0,T ),H 1 ((−h,h),H −1 (G)) <
ε, then there exists a unique z-weak T -periodic solution v, where v lies in
the regularity class given in Theorem 1.1 (a);
(b) if f ∈ L2 ((0, T ), H 1 ((−h, h), L2 (G))2 ) with kf kL2 ((0,T ),H 1 ((−h,h),L2 (G))) <
ε, then there exists a unique strong T -periodic solution v, i.e., v lies in the
regularity class given in Theorem 1.1 (b).
Here, existence of a T -periodic z-weak solution means that there exists a v0 such
that there exists a z-weak solution to the initial boundary value problem (1.2), (1.3)
with initial condition v0 and force f which is T -periodic.
It seems that so far, there has been no result on the time-periodic problem
for partial viscosities. For the primitive equations with full viscosity there are
several results, see Hsia and Shiue [15] and Tachim Medjo [32], on the existence of
unique global strong time-periodic solutions for periodic forces assuming a smallness
condition on the force. In contrast, in [10] existence of strong periodic solutions
for possibly large periodic forces has been shown, but the solutions are possibly
non-unique.
Here, we have adapted the strategy by Galdi, Hieber and Kashiwabara in [10]
to consider the Poincaré map for the construction on time-periodic solutions where
we take advantage of the a priori estimates obtained for the initial value problem.
A crucial ingredient in our proof is that due to the lateral Dirichlet boundary
conditions, there is a Poincaré inequality of the type
kvkL2 (Ω) ≤ Ck∇H vkL2 (Ω) .
Note that for parabolic problems there are quite a few results on time-periodic
solutions. For instance Lukaszewicz et al. [25] treat the the case certain of semilinear
parabolic equations in Hilbert spaces. There are also the maximal Lp -regularity
approaches in Banach spaces for time-periodic solutions by Geissert et al. [11], and
by Kyed and co-authors, cf. [3, 9, 20] and the references therein. More concretely,
for the Navier-Stokes equations there are also many results on periodic solutions
going back to the work of Serrin [31], see e.g. also [27] and references therein for a
more recent survey. We would like to emphasis that for the case of partial viscosity
considered here the system is not purely parabolic anymore, and in particular since
the vertical derivatives in the non-linearity cannot be controlled by the linear part
all these approaches are not applicable. Instead one has to extract additional
information for these particular equations.
1.4. Organization of the paper. In the subsequent Section 2 basic deﬁnitions
and notations are introduced. In particular, the spaces of hydrostatic-solenoidal
functions and the notions of weak and z-weak solutions to the initial value and
time-periodic problem and their regularity properties are discussed. In Section 3
the existence and uniqueness of local z-weak and local strong solutions is proven,
respectively. The time-periodic problem is discussed in Section 4 including the
proof of Theorem 1.4. In Section 5, global a priori bounds are proven, and the
proof of Theorem 1.3 is given. Some auxiliary results are collected in Section 6.

2. Preliminaries
2.1. Function spaces and notations. By L2 (Ω) we denote the standard real
Lebesgue space with scalar product
Z
hf, giΩ :=
f (x, y, z)g(x, y, z) d(x, y, z),
Ω

2

where L (G) and hf, giG are deﬁned analogously. By kf kL2 (Ω) and kf kL2 (G) we
denote the induced norm dropping the subscripts Ω and G in the notation if there
is no ambiguity. For f, g ∈ L2 ((0, T ), L2 (Ω)) we write
Z TZ
hf, giΩ,T :=
f (t, x, y, z)g(t, x, y, z) d(x, y, z) dt
0

Ω

for the scalar product in space and time. For a function f ∈ L∞ ((0, T ), L∞ (Ω)) we
use the abbreviation
kf k∞ := sup kf (t)kL∞ (Ω) .
t∈(0,T )

For s ∈ N the space H s (Ω) consists of f ∈ L2 (Ω) such that ∇α f ∈ L2 (Ω) for
|α| ≤ s endowed with the norm

kf kH s (Ω) =
|α|≤s

and H0s (Ω) := {f ∈ H s (Ω) : f |∂Ω = 0}. Here we used the multi-index notation
∇α = ∂xα1 ∂yα2 ∂zα3 for α ∈ N30 . The spaces H s (G) and H0s (G) are deﬁned analogously,
and we will again just write kf kH s if there is no ambiguity. For non-integer s ≥ 0,
the spaces H s are deﬁned by complex interpolation, and one sets by duality H −s =
(H0s )′ , compare also [33, Chapter 3]. Moreover, we set

spaces H
for p ∈ [1, ∞], where H s = H s,2 , and for Sobolev spaces of functions

r,q
for H s,p ((−h, h), H r,q (G)).
Sometimes we use the short hand notation Hzs,p Hxy

2.2. Hydrostatic-solenoidal vector fields. Now let us reformulate the primitive
equations (1.2) and (1.3). The divergence free condition ∂z w + divH v = 0 and the
boundary condition w(z = ±h) = 0 are equivalent to
Z z
Z h
v(t, x, y, ξ) dξ and divH
(2.2) w(t, x, y, z) = −divH

for v suﬃciently smooth, e.g., divH v ∈ L (Ω). This means, that v – the mean value
of v in the vertical direction – is divergence free, i.e., divH v = 0, where the vertical
average and its complement are
Z h

(2.3)
v(t, x, y) :=
v(t, x, y, ξ) dξ and ṽ := v − v.

Hence one identiﬁes a suitable hydrostatic-solenoidal space as
||·||L2

Lσ2 (Ω) := {v ∈ Cc∞ (Ω)2 : divH v = 0}

,

PRIMITIVE EQUATIONS WITH HORIZONTAL VISCOSITY

where Cc∞ stands for smooth compactly supported functions. Note that this space
admits the decomposition
(2.4)

L2σ (Ω) = {v ∈ L2 (Ω)2 : v = 0} ⊕ L2σ (G),

and the hydrostatic Helmholtz projection thereon is
(2.5)

P : L2 (Ω)2 → L2σ (Ω),

Pv = ṽ + PG v,
||·||

2

where L2σ (G) = {v ∈ Cc∞ (G)2 : divH v = 0} L is the space of solenoidal vector
ﬁelds over G, and PG the corresponding (classical) Helmholtz projection. More
precisely, since due to the product structure L2 (Ω) = L2 (G) ⊗ L2 (−h, h), one obtains by applying P that
Lσ2 (Ω) = L2 (G)2 ⊗ L20 (−h, h) ⊕ L2σ (G) ⊗ span{1},
Rh
where L20 (−h, h) = {v ∈ L2 (−h, h) : −h v(z)dz = 0} and 1 ∈ L2 (−h, h) is a
constant function.
(2.6)

2.3. Weak and z-weak solutions. Next we give a precise notion of weak solutions.
Definition 2.1 (Weak solution). Let f ∈ L2 ((0, T ), L2 ((−h, h), H −1 (G))2 ) and
v0 ∈ Lσ2 (Ω). A function v is called a weak solution of the primitive equations (1.2)
with boundary conditions (1.3) on (0, T ) with initial condition v0 and force f if
(i) One has that v : [0, T ] → L2σ (Ω) is weakly continuous with v(0) = v0 and
v ∈ L∞ ((0, T ), L2σ (Ω)),

∇H v ∈ L2 ((0, T ), L2 (Ω)2×2 )

with v(t, z, ·, ·) ∈ H01 (G)2 almost everywhere for z ∈ (−h, h);
(ii) For some constant c > 0 it satisﬁes
kvkL∞ ((0,T ),L2 (Ω)) + k∇H vkL2 ((0,T ),L2 (Ω))



≤ c kv0 kL2 (Ω) + kf kL2 ((0,T ),H −1 (G)) ;

(iii) v satisﬁes (1.2) and (1.3) in the weak sense, i.e.,

− hv, ϕt iΩ,T + hv(T ), ϕ(T )iΩ − hv0 , ϕ(0)iΩ + h∇H v, ∇H ϕiΩ,T

+ hv · ∇H v, ϕiΩ,T − hwv, ϕz iΩ,T − hwz v, ϕiΩ,T = hf, ϕiΩ,T ,

where w = w(v) is given by (2.2), holds for any
ϕ ∈ H 1,1 ((0, T ), Lσ2 (Ω)) ∩ C 0 ([0, T ], L2σ (Ω))

∩ L2 ((0, T ), L2 ((−h, h), H01 (G))2 ∩ H 1 ((−h, h), L∞ (G))2 ).

Note that there are diﬀerent notions of weak solutions for the primitive equations,
compare [10] or [32]. The notion of z-weak solutions for the primitive equations has
been introduced by Bresch et al. [2] as vorticity solutions for the 2D-case. It plays
also an important role in the study of the 3D-case with full viscosity, see [17] and
the references therein. This is adapted here to the case of only horizontal viscosity.
Definition 2.2 (z-weak solution). Let f ∈ L2 ((0, T ), H 1 ((−h, h), H −1 (G))2 ) and
v0 ∈ Lσ2 (Ω) with ∂z v0 ∈ L2 (Ω)2 . A weak solution v of the primitive equations (1.2)

8

HUSSEIN, SAAL, AND WRONA

with boundary conditions (1.3) on (0, T ) with initial condition v0 and force f is
called a z-weak solution if additionally
vz ∈ L∞ ((0, T ), L2 (Ω)2 ) and ∇H vz ∈ L2 ((0, T ), L2 (Ω)2×2 ).
Definition 2.3 (T -periodic z-weak solutions). A z-weak solution v is called T periodic if v(0) = v(T ).
Remark 2.4.
(a) z-weak solutions are additionally in C 0 ([0, T ], L2 (Ω)), in this
sense v(0) = v(T ) has to be understood in Deﬁnition 2.3.
(b) For a weak solution one has for the non-linear terms w · v, wz · v, v · ∇H v ∈
L2 ((0, T ), L1 (Ω)2 ), and this guarantees that each term in the weak formulation is well-deﬁned. A z-weak solution is regular enough to assure that
even w·vz ∈ L2 ((0, T ), L1 (Ω)2 ) and therefore − hwv, ϕz iΩ,T −hwz v, ϕiΩ,T =
hwvz , ϕiΩ,T for test functions ϕ as in Deﬁnition 2.1.
2.4. Regularity of z-weak solutions. In the following proposition we show that
for z-weak solutions the class of admissible test functions for which especially the
nonlinear terms are well-deﬁned is much larger than for weak solutions. This turns
out to be useful when testing a z-weak solution with itself, and in particular when
proving the uniqueness of z-weak solutions.
Proposition 2.5 (Class of test functions for z-weak solutions). For
f ∈ L2 ((0, T ), H 1 ((−h, h), H −1 (G))2 ), v0 ∈ Lσ2 (Ω) with ∂z v0 ∈ L2 (Ω) let v be a
z-weak solution to (1.2), (1.3) on (0, T ). Then
h∇H v, ∇H ϕiΩ,T ,

hv · ∇H v, ϕiΩ,T , hw∂z v, ϕiΩ,T ,

and hf, ϕiΩ,T

are well-defined for all
ϕ ∈ L∞ ((0, T ), Lσ2 (Ω)) ∩ L2 ((0, T ), L2 ((−h, h), H01 (G))2 ).
Proof. Let (ϕ(n) )n be a sequence of smooth functions such that ϕ(n) → ϕ for n → ∞
in L∞ ((0, T ), Lσ2 (Ω)) ∩ L2 ((0, T ), L2((−h, h), H01 (G))2 ). Then we have

Moreover, z-weak solutions preserve certain Lq -regularity vertically reﬂecting
the transport-like behavior in this direction.
Proposition 2.6 (Lq -norm of vz remains bounded for ∂z v0 ∈ Lq .). Let v be
a z-weak solution to (1.2), (1.3) on (0, T ), T > 0, with initial condition v0 ∈
H 1 ((−h, h), L2 (Ω)2 ) with divH v0 = 0 and force f ≡ 0. If in addition ∂z v0 ∈ Lq (Ω)2
for q > 2, then vz ∈ L∞ ((0, T ), Lq (Ω))2 .
Proof. We multiply the equation for ∂z v,

3. Local solutions with force
Theorem 1.1 (a) and (b) correspond to Proposition 3.1 and 3.2, respectively.
3.1. Local z-weak solutions. We work in the spaces
H := {v ∈ L2 (Ω)2 |∂z v ∈ L2 (Ω)2 }

and Hσ := H ∩ Lσ2 (Ω)

equipped with the scalar product hu, viH := hu, viΩ + h∂z u, ∂z viΩ and
1
V := {v ∈ H|∂x v, ∂y v ∈ H} ∩ H0,l
(Ω)2

and Vσ := V ∩ L2σ (Ω)

with the scalar product hu, viV := hu, viH + h∇H u, ∇H viH . Note that H =
H 1 ((−h, h), L2 (G))2 and V = H 1 ((−h, h), H01 (G))2 . By V ′ we denote the space
V ′ = H 1 ((−h, h), H −1 (G))2 .
We also denote the dual pairing in V × V ′ by h·, ·iH to keep the notation simple.
Proposition 3.1 (Existence and uniqueness of local z-weak solutions). Let v0 ∈ Hσ
and f ∈ L2 ((0, T ), V ′ ), then there exists a T ′ ∈ (0, T ] such that there is a unique
z-weak solution of the primitive equations on (0, T ′ ) with v ∈ C 0 ([0, T ′ ], L2 (Ω)). If
||v0 ||H and ||f ||L2 ((0,T ),V ′ ) are sufficiently small, then T ′ = T .
Proof. We subdivide the proof of the existence and uniqueness into several steps.
Step 1 (Galerkin approximation). To deﬁne a suitable basis for a Galerkin
scheme, one can take advantage of (2.6). To this end, let (ϕm )m ⊂ C ∞ (G)2 ∩
H01 (G)2 be an orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions to the eigenvalues (µm )m of the
Dirichlet Laplacian in L2 (G)2 , and (ϕ̃m )m ⊂ C ∞ (G)2 ∩ H01 (G)2 ∩ L2σ (G) an orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions to the eigenvalues (µ̃m )m of the Stokes operator
in L2σ (G). Moreover, cos kπ
2h (z + h) for k ∈ N0 deﬁnes a basis of eigenfunctions to
the Neumann Laplacian on L2 (−h, h) and by the ﬁrst representation theorem even
a basis on H 1 (−h, h).

PRIMITIVE EQUATIONS WITH HORIZONTAL VISCOSITY

Hence, we deﬁne for m ∈ N, k ∈ N0 the functions Φm,k ∈ C ∞ (Ω) by


Φm,0 (x, y, z) :=

Then span{Φm,k |m ∈ N, k ∈ N0 } is dense in Hσ , in particular divH Φm,k = 0,
because for k > 0 we have already Φm,k = 0 and divH Φm,0 = divH ϕ̃m = 0. We set
(3.3)

Hσ,n := span{Φm,k |m, k ≤ n}

and Pn : Hσ → Hσ,n

to be the orthogonal projection onto it. We project the primitive equations onto
the ﬁnite dimensional space Hσ,n and we are looking for a solution
vn = (v1,n , v2,n ) : [0, T ] → Hσ,n
of the system of ordinary diﬀerential equations

R z h∇H p, Φm,k iΩ = 0, with initial condition
vn (0) = Pn v0 and wn (t, x, y, z) = − −h divH vn (t, x, y, s) ds. Note that the properties of Φm,k imply divH v n = 0 and thus we have wn (z = ±h) = 0. Now, we can
represent

gn(mk) (t)Φm,k for some gn(mk) : [0, T ] → R.
m,k≤n

The existence of a solution vn ∈ H 1 ((0, T ), Hσ,n ) follows from classical ODE theory.
Step 2 (L2 -estimate). Next, we prove an estimate for vn in Lσ2 (Ω). Integrating
by parts, for k > 0 it holds for any function g ∈ V ′ that


k2 π2
hg, Φm,k iΩ ,
hg, Φm,k iH = hg, Φm,k iΩ + hg, −∂zz Φm,k iΩ = 1 +

and for k = 0 the corresponding equality holds, because ∂z Φm,0 = 0. Thus (3.4)
yields
(3.5)

h∂t vn , Φm,k iΩ + hvn · ∇H vn , Φm,k iΩ + hwn ∂z vn , Φm,k iΩ − h∆H vn , Φm,k iΩ
= hf, Φm,k iΩ .

We multiply this equation by gn

and sum over m, k ≤ n. It then follows that

kvn k2L2 (Ω) + 2k∇H vn k2L2 (Ω) = 2 hf, vn iΩ − 2 hvn · ∇H vn , vn iΩ − 2 hwn ∂z vn , vn iΩ
= 2 hf, vn iΩ

for ε > 0, where we used wn (±h) = 0 when integrating by parts in the vertical
direction to show that hvn · ∇H vn , vn iΩ + hwn ∂z vn , vn iΩ = 0. Thus, for ε small

12

enough, using the Poincaré inequality of Lemma 6.1, there exists a constant C > 0
independent of vn such that
(3.6) kvn kL∞ ((0,T ),L2 (Ω)) + k∇H vn kL2 ((0,T ),L2 (Ω))

≤ Ckv0 kL2 (Ω) + Ckf kL2 ((0,T ),L2 ((−h,h),H −1 (G))) .

Step 3 (H-estimate). To derive now an estimate for vn in H we multiply (3.4)
(mk)
and sum over m, k ≤ n. This gives
by gn

= hf, vn iΩ + h∂z f, ∂z vn iΩ − h(∂z vn ) · ∇H vn , ∂z vn iΩ + hdivH vn ∂z vn , ∂z vn iΩ .

Here one has used the cancellation property for the non-linear term with respect
to h·, ·iΩ . Note that with respect to h·, ·iH one does not have such cancellation in
general. Now, Lemma 6.2 a) yields with f = g = ∂z vn and h = ∇H vn that

This is well-deﬁned provided that

PRIMITIVE EQUATIONS WITH HORIZONTAL VISCOSITY

T ′ ∈ (0, T ] is suﬃciently small. Using the monotonicity of Φ which implys the one
of Φ−1 and the energy inequality (3.6) one even obtains that


kvn (t)k2H ≤ Φ−1 Φ(kv0 k2H + kf k2L2 ((0,t),V ′ ) ) + kv0 k2L2 (Ω) + ckf k2L2((0,t),V ′ ) .

Hence for small times T ′ ∈ (0, T ] or for data kv0 k2L2 (Ω) + kf k2L2((0,t),V ′ ) being suﬃciently small when T ′ = T , one obtains using the continuity of Φ−1 that for some

k∇H vn (s)k2H ds ≤ c(kv0 k2H + kf k2L2 ((0,t),V ′ ) ), t ∈ (0, T ′ ].

Step 4 (Convergence). On this interval [0, T ′ ] we can deduce the weak convergence of a subsequence of (vn )n in L2 ((0, T ), Hσ ) (which we do not rename) to
some limit v ∈ L2 ((0, T ), Hσ ). The energy estimate (3.9) for the sequence gives
that kvk2L∞ ((0,T ),H) and k∇H vkL2 ((0,T ),H) remain bounded, and hence v is in the
regularity class of weak and z-weak solutions.
To show that the limit is in fact a weak solution, one takes into account that
especially the full gradient of vn is uniformly bounded in L2 ((0, T ), L2 (Ω)) and from
the compact embedding in the Rellich-Kondrachov theorem the strong convergence
of (vn )n in L2 ((0, T ), L2 (Ω)) follows. This implies that in L1 ((0, T ), L1 (Ω))
vn · ∇H vn ⇀ v · ∇H v,

wn vn ⇀ wv

and ∂z wn vn ⇀ ∂z wv.

Let now ϕn ∈ C 1 ([0, T ], Hn ∩ V ) be of the form ϕn (t) = m,k≤n hm,k (t)Φm,k with
hm,k ∈ C 1 ([0, T ], R). From w(z = ±h) we conclude
hwn ∂z vn , ϕn iΩ = − h∂z wn vn , ϕn iΩ − hwn vn , ∂z ϕn iΩ ,
and using (3.5) we get

+ h∇H v, ∇H ϕiΩ,T + hv(T ), ϕ(T )iΩ − hv(0), ϕ(0)iΩ = hf, ϕiΩ,T .

Showing that v(0) = v0 and v(T ) are well-deﬁned follows from the next step which
only uses the Galerkin approximation and the convergence.
Step 5 (Continuity in time). For l > n we extend vn ∈ H 1 ((0, T ), Hσ,n ) to
(mk)
1
= 0 if m ≥ l or k ≥ l. For
H ((0, T ), Hσ,l ) ⊂ C 0 ([0, T ], L2(Ω)) by setting gn
n < l ∈ N we set u := vn − vl and wu := wn − wl , where vn , vl are elements of the
convergent subsequence. From (3.5) it follows that
h∂t u, Φm,k iH + hvn · ∇H vn − vl · ∇H vl , Φm,k iH + hwn ∂z vn − wl ∂z vl , Φm,k iH

2
′
f ∈ L ((0, T ), H). Then the local z-weak solution on (0, T ) for T ′ ∈ (0, T ] given
by Proposition 3.1 has the additional regularity

∇H v ∈ L∞ ((0, T ′ ), L2 (Ω)),

∆H v, ∂t v ∈ L2 ((0, T ′ ), L2 (Ω)).

Proof. Recall that we have obtained in the proof of Proposition 3.1 a solution vn =
(v1n , v2n ) ∈ H 1 ((0, T ), Hn,σ ) of the system (3.4) of ordinary diﬀerential equations
with vn (0) = Pn v0 . These satisfy the L2 -estimate (3.6) on [0, T ] and the H-estimate
(3.9) on some small time interval [0, T ′] for T ′ ∈ (0, T ], where T = T ′ if the data
are suﬃciently small.
2
Step 1 (L2t -L2x -estimate on ∆H v and L∞
t -Lx -estimate on ∇H v). Here we use the
higher regularity of the initial data and the fact, that the functions Φm,k deﬁned in
(3.1) and (3.2) are a basis of eigenfunctions to certain operators. Multiplication of
(3.5) ﬁrst with the eigenvalue µm of ϕm or respectively µ̃m of ϕ̃m and second with
(mk)
gn , and then summing over both m and k gives

The time integral of the right hand side is bounded by Step 1 and (3.9) assuming

get, that for a subsequence (which we do not rename) also ∂t vn and ∆H vn converge
weakly in L2 ((0, T ), L2 (Ω)) and that the limit of ∇H vn is in L∞ ((0, T ), L2 (Ω)).

4. Time-periodic solutions for small forces
The methods used to prove global existence and uniqueness results for the initial
value problem for small data can be adapted for the construction of time-periodic
solutions. This will be done ﬁrst for z-weak and then for strong solutions.
Proposition 4.1 (Existence and uniqueness of time-periodic solutions). For εb > 0
there exists εa > 0 such that
(a) if f ∈ L2 ((0, T ), V ′ ) with kf kL2((0,T ),V ′ ) < εa , then there exists a T -periodic
z-weak solution with sup0<s<T kvn (s)k2H + k∇H vn (s)k2L2 ((0,T ),H) < εb ;
(b) if f ∈ L2 ((0, T ), H) with kf kL2 ((0,T ),H) < εa , then there exists a T -periodic
strong solution with sup0<s<T kvn (s)k2H 1 + k∆H vn k2L2 ((0,T ),L2 (Ω)) < εb .

Assuming that kvn (0)kH and kf kL2((0,T ),V ′ ) are suﬃciently small, one has from
(3.9) for t = T and (3.6) that
(4.1)

eT c kvn (T )k2H ≤ kvn (0)k2H + ceT c (kvn (0)k4H + kf (s)k2L2 ((0,T ),V ′ ) ).

Assume now that kvn (0)k2H ≤ R for R ∈ (0, 1) being small enough to satisfy the
smallness condition and (1 − e−T c )/c > R, moreover let kf (s)kL2 ((0,T ),L2 (Ω)) be
suﬃciently small for (3.9) to hold and
kf (s)k2L2 ((0,T ),V ′ ) ≤

Then
eT c kvn (T )kH ≤ R + ceT c R2 + (ecT − 1)R − eT c R2 = ReT c .
Hence, for this R > 0, and BR,n := {vn ∈ Hσ,n : kvn kH ≤ R} and given f , the map
BR,n → BR,n ,

v(0) 7→ v(T ),

where vn is the solution to (3.4) is a continuous self-mapping. By Brouwer’s ﬁxed
point theorem, for any n ∈ N0 , there is a ﬁxed point, i.e., vn,0 ∈ Hn,σ with
vn,0 = vn (0) = vn (T ). Since the vn,0 are uniformly bounded in H by R there
is a convergent subsequence in L2 (Ω), the limit of which is in H. Following the
proof of Proposition 3.1, the approximate solutions vn converge to a z-weak solution
with v(0) = v(T ).
By (3.9)
kvn (s)k2L∞ ((0,T ),H) + k∇H vn (s)k2L2 ((0,T ),H) ≤ c(kv0 k2H + kf k2L2((0,T ),V ′ ) )
≤ c(R2 + ε2a )

which for R and εa suﬃciently small is smaller εb .

Assuming that kv0 kH 1 (Ω) and kf kL2 ((0,T ),H) are suﬃciently small, one can combine
this with the previously obtained estimate (4.1) to obtain
eT c kvn (T )kH 1 (Ω) ≤ kvn (0)kH 1 (Ω) + ceT c (kvn (0)k2H 1 (Ω) + kf (s)kL2 ((0,T ),L2 (Ω)) ).
Proceeding now analogously to the above, one proves the existence of a small T periodic solution with v(0) = v(T ) ∈ H 1 (Ω)2 ∩ L2σ (Ω) suﬃciently small. By Proposition 3.2 this is a strong solution.
The norm estimate follows as above, but now by combining (3.9) with (3.12). 
Proof of Theorem 1.4. The existence of T -periodic solutions in Theorem 1.4 (a)
and (b) follows directly from Proposition 4.1 (a) for forces kf kL2 ((0,T ),V ′ ) < εa and
(b) for forces kf kL2((0,T ),H) < εa , respectively.
Now, to prove the uniqueness let v1 be the T -periodic z-weak solution constructed in Proposition 4.1 satisfying the required smallness assumption, and let
and v2 be another T -periodic z-weak solutions for the same f ∈ L2 ((0, T ), V ′ ). As
in Step 6 in the proof of Theorem 3.1, one considers u := v1 − v2 , and then it holds

and for c 0 k∇H v1 (s)kH +k∇H v1 (s)kH kv1 (s)kH ds < T C, one has a factor smaller

initial value problem uniqueness of the T -periodic solutions. This condition holds
provided that εb is so small that C(εb + ε2b ) < CT , and one chooses ε = εa with the
corresponding εa .

5. Global strong solutions
The main idea is to establish ﬁrst a global a priori bound for some smooth data,
and second to use both the partial parabolic smoothing in the horizontal directions
and the conservation of regularity in vertical direction to show that some z-weak
solutions reach this setting for t > 0.

20

5.1. Global a priori bound. For the global bound on strong solutions (cf. Proposition 5.9), we prove a diﬀerential inequality of the form
f ′ ≤ kvk2L∞ f,

where f contains certain Sobolev-norms of the solution, via performing the ﬁrst
order estimates (cf. Proposition 5.7 and 5.8). As in [6], to control the kvk∞ coeﬃcient, we use the logarithmic Sobolev inequality (cf. Proposition 5.2) and
√
show that the Lq -norm of the solutions grow asymptotically at most as q (cf.
Proposition 5.5). Then the classical Grönwall lemma gives the desired bound.
This implies global existence via a standard contradiction argument. To prove the
logarithmic Sobolev inequality in our setting we need the following extension result.
Lemma 5.1. Let qH , qz ∈ (1, ∞) and f ∈ LqH ((−h, h), H01,qH (G)), such that ∂z f ∈
Lqz (Ω). Then there exists an extension f˜ : R3 → R, such that
kf kL∞ ≤ kf˜kL∞ (R3 ) , kf˜kLq (R3 ) ≤ Ckf kLq , k∂i f˜kLqi (R3 ) ≤ Ck∂i f kLqi ,
for all q ∈ (1, ∞) and (qi , ∂i ) ∈ {(qH , ∇H ), (qz , ∂z )}.

Proof. The idea is, vertically, to reﬂect f on z
function fˆ : G × R → R and cut it oﬀ thereafter.

Proposition 5.2 (Logarithmic Sobolev inequality). Let p = (p1 , p2 , p3 ) ∈ (1, ∞)3

Assume from now on that v is a strong and suﬃciently smooth solution to the
primitive equations on (0, T ) with initial condition v0 and f ≡ 0. On the way of
showing, that the Lq -norm of the solution grows asymptotically at most of order
√
O( q) we need to prove that the term v · ∇H v lies in L2 ((0, T ), L2 (Ω)). To this
end we need estimates on k∇H vkL2 . As initial step, recall that by testing with v

For the proof we need the following estimate on the pressure.
Lemma 5.6 (Estimate on the pressure for the 2-D Stokes equations). Let v, p be
a solution to the two-dimensional Stokes equations
∂t v − ∆H v + ∇H p = f ,

divH v = 0.

Then for almost every s ∈ (0, T )
k∇H p(s)kL2 ≤ ||f (s)||L2 + ||∆H v(s)||L2 .
provided each term is finite.
Proof. Applying the complement of the 2-D Helmholtz projection PG , i.e., 1 − PG
to the Stokes equations gives
∇H p = (1 − PG )(f (s) + ∆H v).

Proof of Theorem 1.3 (a). Note ﬁrst that a local solution can be constructed as
in Proposition 3.1 and 3.2 by a Galerkin scheme using the a priori bound from
Proposition 5.9.
Now, to prove global existence, let Tmax be the supremum over the existence
times of the strong solution, and assume that Tmax < ∞. Choose
δ < max{Tmax, T ∗ (Ckv0 kHη1 )},

where T ∗ (K) denotes the minimal existence time given by Theorem 1.1 (b) of the
strong solution of the problem with initial data of norm at most K, and C is the
constant of the previous Proposition.
Since kvkL∞ ((0,Tmax ),H 1 ) ≤ Ckv0 kHη1 there is a T̂ ∈ (Tmax − δ, Tmax ), such that

kv(T̂ )kH 1 ≤ Ckv0 kHη1 . By the local existence of strong solutions there exists a

strong solution v̂ to the problem with initial data v(T̂ ) with an existence time
T ∗ (kv(T̂ )kH 1 ). Since T ∗ : R+ → R+ is monotone decreasing, it holds by the last
proposition that
T ∗ (kv(T̂ )kH 1 ) ≥ T ∗ (Ckv0 kHη1 ) > δ.
Note that v|[T̂ ,Tmax ] = v̂|[0,Tmax −T̂ ] . By uniqueness of the solution, v can be extended to T̂ + T ∗(kv(T̂ )kH 1 ) > T̂ + δ > Tmax . A contradiction to the maximality of
Tmax . So, our assumption of Tmax < ∞ was wrong, ﬁnishing the global existence
proof.

5.2. Extension of z-weak solutions to global strong solutions.

Proof of Theorem 1.3 (b). By Theorem 1.1 (a), there is a z-weak solution on (0, T ′ )
1
for some T ′ > 0, and ∇H vz ∈ L2 ((0, T ′ ), L2 (Ω)2×2 ) and hence v(t) ∈ Hz1 Hxy

one has a smooth approximating sequence (vn ) ⊂ C00 ((0, T ′ ), Hz1 Hxy
exists a subsequence (vnk ) such that vnk (t) converges for almost every t ∈ (0, T ′ ).
1
(Ω) and divH v(t1 ) = 0. Taking
In particular there exists t1 > 0 with v(t1 ) ∈ H0,l
v(t1 ) as new initial value one obtains by Theorem 1.1 (b) a strong solution on
(t1 , T ′′ ) for some T ′′ ∈ (t1 , T ′ ). This strong solution agrees on (t1 , T ′′ ) with the
original z-weak solution deﬁned on (0, T ′ ) since vnk (t1 ) converges also in L2 and
since v ∈ C 0 ([0, T ′ ], L2 ) its L2 -limit is in fact v(t1 ). Hence by the uniqueness of
z-weak solutions, cf. Proposition 3.1, both agree on (t1 , T ′′ ). Note that kv(t1 )kH 1
is ﬁnite, but there is no explicit control on its norm.

In particular for θ = 3/4 one has Hz Hxy ⊂ L∞
z Lxy = L (Ω). Moreover, by
Proposition 2.6 one has that vz ∈ L∞ ((0, T ′ ), Lη (Ω)2 ) since by assumption here
∂z v0 ∈ Lη (Ω). Putting the pieces together, one deduces that

v ∈ L2 ((t1 , T ′′ ), H 1 (Ω)2 ∩ {v ∈ L2 (Ω)2 : vz ∈ Lη (Ω)2 } ∩ L∞ (Ω)2 )

and therefore for almost every t ∈ (t1 , T ′′ ) one has

v(t) ∈ Hη1 = H 1 (Ω)2 ∩ {v ∈ L2 (Ω)2 : vz ∈ Lη (Ω)2 } ∩ L∞ (Ω)2 .

Following the previous arguments one takes now such t2 ∈ (t1 , T ′′ ) as new initial
time, and one ends up in the situation of Theorem 1.3 (a) which gives that v extends
to a global strong solution on (t2 , T ) for any T > 0. In fact 0 < t1 < t2 < T ′′ have
been arbitrarily small, and therefore for δ ≥ t2 the statement follows.

6. Some inequalities
Lemma 6.1 (Poincaré inequality for lateral vanishing trace). There exists a constant C > 0 such that

||∇H v||L2 (Ω) ≤ C||∆H v||L2 (Ω)

for
for

v ∈ L2 ((−h, h), H01 (G)),

v ∈ L2 ((−h, h), H 2 (G) ∩ H01 (G)).

Proof. Note that by the classical 2D-Poincaré inequality for some C2D > 0
2
||∇H v(·, z)||2L2 (G)
||v(·, z)||2L2 (G) ≤ C2D

for allmost every z ∈ (−h, h),

and integrating with respect to z gives the ﬁrst estimate with C = C2D 2h.

For the second inequality, note that there is a C2D > 0 such that
2
||v(·, z)||2L2 (G) ≤ C2D
||∆H v(·, z)||2L2 (G)

for allmost every z ∈ (−h, h),

and integrating with respect to z gives ||v||2L2 (Ω) ≤ C||∆H v||2L2 (Ω) . Using this,
