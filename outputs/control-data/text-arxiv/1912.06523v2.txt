ABSTRACT
To investigate the variability of the star formation rate (SFR) of galaxies, we define a star formation
change parameter, SFR5Myr /SFR800Myr which is the ratio of the SFR averaged within the last 5 Myr
to the SFR averaged within the last 800 Myr. We show that this parameter can be determined from
a combination of Hα emission and Hδ absorption, plus the 4000 Å break, with an uncertainty of
∼0.07 dex for star-forming galaxies. We then apply this estimator to MaNGA galaxies, both globally
within Re and within radial annuli. We find that the global SFR5Myr /SFR800Myr , which indicates by
how much a galaxy has changed its specific SFR (sSFR) is nearly independent of its sSFR, i.e. of
its the position relative to the star formation main sequence (SFMS) as defined by SFR800Myr . Also,
at any sSFR, there are as many galaxies increasing their sSFR as decreasing it, as required if the
dispersion in the SFMS is to stay the same. The SFR5Myr /SFR800Myr of the overall galaxy population
is very close to that expected for the evolving Main Sequence. Both of these provide a reassuring
check on the validity of our calibration of the estimator. We find that galaxies with higher global
SFR5Myr /SFR800Myr appear to have higher SFR5Myr /SFR800Myr at all galactic radii, i.e. that galaxies
with a recent temporal enhancement in overall SFR have enhanced star formation at all galactic radii.
The dispersion of the SFR5Myr /SFR800Myr at a given relative galactic radius and a given stellar
mass decreases with the (indirectly inferred) gas depletion time: locations with short gas depletion
time appear to undergo bigger variations in their star-formation rates on Gyr or less timescales. In
Wang et al. (2019) we showed that the dispersion in star-formation rate surface densities ΣSFR in the
galaxy population appears to be inversely correlated with the inferred gas depletion timescale and
interpreted this in terms of the dynamical response of a gas-regulator system to changes in the gas
inflow rate. In this paper, we can now prove directly with SFR5Myr /SFR800Myr that these effects are
indeed due to genuine temporal variations in the SFR of individual galaxies on timescales between
107 and 109 years rather than possibly reflecting intrinsic, non-temporal, differences between different
galaxies.

1. INTRODUCTION

Studying the star formation histories (SFH) of galaxies
is a major tool to study the formation and evolution of
galaxies. Thanks to a series of deep surveys of galaxies,
the evolution of the star formation rate (SFR) for the
global galaxy population also known as the cosmic evolution of the star formation rate density (SFRD), is well
established up to redshift of ∼9 (e.g. Lilly et al. 1996;
Schiminovich et al. 2005; Bouwens et al. 2011, 2014;
Madau & Dickinson 2014; Hagen et al. 2015; Alavi et al.
2016; Goto et al. 2019). The evolution of the SFRD is
measured based on the galaxy population at different
redshifts.
Observationally, most star-forming (SF) galaxies form
a narrow sequence on the stellar mass-SFR diagram up
to at least redshift of 3 (e.g. Brinchmann et al. 2004;
Daddi et al. 2007; Elbaz et al. 2007; Noeske et al. 2007;
Elbaz et al. 2011). This sequence is known as the star
formation main sequence (SFMS). The relation is approximately linear, i.e. there is a characteristic specific
SFR (sSFR). The sSFR-normalization of the SFMS has
been found to evolve with lookback time as (1 + z)2.2

(Pannella et al. 2009; Stark et al. 2013; Schreiber et al.
2015; Boogaard et al. 2018). This increase with lookback time of the sSFR of typical galaxies at a given
mass is due to the higher rate of accretion of cold gas
by galaxies at high redshift. The scatter of the SFMS
is rather small at any given redshift, 0.2-0.4 dex, depending on the exact definition of the SF populations
and the method to obtain the stellar masses and SFRs.
The origin of the SFMS and the small scatter of the
SFMS is not well understood, but likely reflects the effect of a long-term quasi-steady state between gas accretion, star formation and gas outflow driven by feedback
processes (e.g. Schaye et al. 2010; Bouché et al. 2010;
Davé et al. 2011; Lilly et al. 2013; Tacchella et al. 2016;
Rodrı́guez-Puebla et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2019).
It is clear that the scatter of the SFMS is relevant to the
variability of SFHs of individual SF galaxies, and accurate measurements of SFHs could uncover the contributions of the scatter of SFMS by the variation of SFHs at
different timescales. However, the accurate star formation histories of individual galaxies are still poorly determined from observations, especially on short timescales
(< 100 Myr).
Many physical processes have been proposed to account for the variability of the SFHs for individual galaxies. These processes are generally separated into two

2

Wang & Lilly

types: internal processes and those driven by the external environment. Basically, these processes enhance
or suppress (or even quench) the star formation by producing changes in the cold gas content and/or a change
in the star formation efficiency (SFE), defined as the
SFR per unit mass of cold gas. For instance, disk instabilities (e.g. Dekel & Burkert 2014; Zolotov et al. 2015;
Tacchella et al. 2016) and bar-induced gas inflows (e.g.
Wang et al. 2012; Lin et al. 2017; Chown et al. 2019)
may enhance the star formation via an increase of star
formation efficiency, while outflows driven by stellar feedback (e.g. Ceverino & Klypin 2009; Muratov et al. 2015;
El-Badry et al. 2016) or tidal/ram-pressure stripping
in massive halos (e.g. Gunn & Gott 1972; Moore et al.
1996; Abadi et al. 1999; Poggianti et al. 2017) may suppress the star formation in galaxies by removing cold gas.
The variability of SFHs on short and long timescales is
likely governed by physical processes operating on different timescales (Sparre et al. 2015, 2017; Broussard et al.
2019; Wang et al. 2019). For instance, variations in gas
accretion may drive the variation of SFR on relatively
long timescales (Sparre et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2019),
while feedback from supernovae or active galactic nuclei
(AGN) may produce changes in the SFR on relatively
short timescales (Sparre et al. 2017). Having more extensive information of how individual galaxies change
their SFRs over time could reveal which physical processes enhance or suppress the star formation during the
lifetime of galaxies, and which processes govern the variation of SFR over long and short timescales.
Hydro-dynamical simulations can, in principle, produce accurate SFHs of simulated galaxies, which may
be helpful to understand the origin of the scatter of
the SFMS, regardless of the poorly understood sub-grid
physics. Indeed, based on cosmological zoom-in simulations of 26 moderately massive galaxies, Tacchella et al.
(2016) found that SF galaxies oscillate about the SFMS
ridge on time-scales of ∼0.4 Hubble time (tHubble ) at
1 < z < 4. The oscillation is the result of an interplay
between gas compaction, gas depletion (including star
formation and outflow), and accretion. Based on the EAGLE simulations, Matthee & Schaye (2019) investigated
the evolution and origin of the scatter of the SFMS. They
found that the scatter in sSFR in the local Universe originates in their simulation from a combination of fluctuations on short time-scales (0.2-2 Gyr), likely associated
with self-regulation of cooling, star formation and outflows, and variations on long time-scale (∼ 10 Gyr) associated to different halo formation times. They found that
the long time-scale variations dominate the scatter of
the SFMS in the local Universe. Rodrı́guez-Puebla et al.
(2016) found that the scatter of the halo mass accretion rate (∼0.3 dex) in the Bolshoi-Planck simulation
(Klypin et al. 2016) is comparable to the observed scatter of SFMS. However, it should be noted that the halo
mass accretion rate is averaged over 0.2tHubble, which is
much larger than the timescale of most SFR indicators
in observations, such as Hα and ultraviolet/infrared luminosity. The scatter of halo mass accretion rate could
be larger than 0.3 dex if it was averaged within a shorter
timescale.
Although the integrated spectral energy distribution
(SED) of galaxies records the information of star formation at different lookback times, it is very challeng-

ing to obtain accurate SFHs by SED modelling (e.g.
Papovich et al. 2001; Shapley et al. 2001; Muzzin et al.
2009; Conroy 2013; Carnall et al. 2019; Leja et al. 2019).
As shown in the SED modelling test of Ge et al. (2018),
the SED fitting code is able to reproduce the input
stellar population age, metallicity and mass-to-light ratio with reasonable accuracy in dust-poor cases, while
large discrepancies can occur in dust-rich cases. In
addition, although SED modelling can reproduce the
overall shape of input SFHs in most cases, the shorttime variations (∼ 100 Myr) in SFHs are usually not
well recovered (e.g. Ocvirk et al. 2006; Gallazzi & Bell
2009; Zibetti et al. 2009; Leja et al. 2019). Considering the possible variation of the initial mass function (IMF), and possibly different dust attenuations
in young and old stellar populations (Calzetti et al.
2000; Moustakas & Kennicutt 2006; Wild et al. 2011;
Hemmati et al. 2015; Reddy et al. 2015), we are still
quite a long way from obtaining accurate SFHs from
SED modelling. An alternative way of obtaining individual SFHs is to analyze images of galaxies that
are resolved down to individual stars (e.g. Tolstoy et al.
2009; Cignoni et al. 2015; Sacchi et al. 2019), but this
approach is only practical for the closest galaxies.
Given the difficulties of obtaining accurate SFHs
of galaxies from observations, a number of measures
comparing a longer-timescale SFR to a shorter-timescale
SFR have been proposed in the literature (Sullivan et al.
2000; Boselli et al. 2009; Wuyts et al. 2011; Guo et al.
2016; Sparre et al. 2017; Broussard et al. 2019;
Emami et al. 2019; Faisst et al. 2019).
These are
often called “burstiness” parameters, but we ourselves
find this restrictive, as will be dismissed below. It
is clear that such burstiness contains information on
the variability of recent SFHs. Weisz et al. (2012)
found that the distribution of Hα-to-far-UV (FUV) flux
ratios of a sample of 185 nearby galaxies can be well
matched with simple, periodic SFH models, but can not
be matched by the constant SFHs with varying IMF.
Guo et al. (2016) found a decrease in Hβ-to-FUV ratio
with decreasing galaxy mass, which can be explained by
a bursty SFH on a timescale of a few tens of Myrs on
galactic scales. More recently, Broussard et al. (2019)
found that the dispersion of burstiness characterizes
the stochasticity of a galaxy population’s recent star
formation, rather than the average value of burstiness.
Consistent with this, Caplar & Tacchella (2019) have
tried to use the scatter of the SFMS based on different
SFR indicators to model the stochasticity of SFHs.
A common method of quantifying burstiness is to use
the average Hα-to-UV flux ratio. The Hα emission is
produced by the recombination of gas ionized by photons from massive stars (> 15M⊙ ), and is expected to
be observed only within the typical lifetimes of these
massive stars (< 5 Myr). The UV continuum comes
from non-ionizing photospheric emission from stars with
mass greater than 3M⊙ (Kennicutt 1998, and references therein), which have lifetimes of <300 Myr. However, as pointed out by Caplar & Tacchella (2019), the
commonly-used SFR indicators, such as Hα, NUV, FUV,
u-band and UV+IR luminosities, do not exactly follow
the recent SFHs within a specified timescale. Instead, the
SFRs traced by any of these indicators can be considered
to be a convolution of the SFH with the luminosity evo-

lution of these indicators for a single stellar population.
This increases the complexity of studying the stochasticity of SFHs of a galaxy population. In addition, the measured burstiness based on the above indicators strongly
depends on the dust attenuation correction, which may
significantly broaden the scatter.
In this work, we develop a new parameter to characterize the change of star formation, SFR5Myr /SFR800Myr .
This is the ratio of the SFR averaged within the most recent 5 Myr to the SFR averaged within the last 800 Myr.
The definition of this parameter is similar to the definition of the burstiness in the literature, but in this work
we prefer to call it a “star formation change parameter”
(or simply the “change parameter”), because galaxies can
either enhance or suppress their star formation in the recent 5 Myr with respect to the average star formation
within the last 800 Myr. In other words, the parameter
can take values above or below unity, and indeed should
average to unity over a large enough population.
Our change parameter SFR79 is calibrated using
three diagnostic observational parameters: the equivalent width of Hα emission (EW(Hα)), the Lick index
of Hδ absorption (EW(Hδ)A ), and the size of 4000 Å
break (Dn (4000)). The Hα emission is a good tracer of
the SFR averaged within the last 5 Myr, the EW(Hδ A )
traces the star formation within the last roughly ∼1
Gyr, and the 4000 Å break is sensitive to the lightweighted stellar age within 2 Gyr (e.g. Balogh et al. 1999;
Kauffmann et al. 2003; Li et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2017,
2018). These three parameters can be directly measured from galaxy spectra, and each being measured at
a single wavelength they are all, in principle, insensitive to dust attenuation, although dust effects can still
enter if different components of the system suffer different extinctions (this is explored in Section 2.6 below). These observational parameters provide the basic
means to measure the star formation change parameter
SFR5Myr /SFR800Myr . We then apply this estimator to
the MaNGA (Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point
Observatory; Bundy et al. 2015) galaxies.
We then use this change parameter to study the variations of SFR between and within galaxies on different timescales and the recent change of star formation
within and across galaxies. We establish a new observational result that strengthens the scenario proposed in
Wang et al. (2019, hereafter W19) that the variation of
SFR within and across galaxies is the result of the dynamic response of the gas-regulator system to the variation of the gas accretion.
This paper is organized as follows. We develop the
new change indicator SFR5Myr /SFR800Myr of SFH in Section 2. Specifically, in Section 2.1, we discuss the meaning of the star-formation change parameter. In Section
2.2 and 2.3, we present the detailed calibration of the
SFR5Myr /SFR800Myr based on three the three observational diagnostic parameters, and a wide suite of mock
SFHs. We build the calibrator of SFR5Myr /SFR800Myr
and examine how good it is in Section 2.4. We explore the dependence of the calibrator on different IMFs
and different isochrones in Section 2.5. In Section 2.6,
we present the recipes of the dust attenuation correction for EW(Hα), EW(Hδ A ) and Dn (4000) when applying the calibrator to the observed spectra of galaxies.

In Section 3, we apply the calibrator to a well-defined
SF galaxy sample selected from MaNGA survey, and
generate the maps and profiles of SFR5Myr /SFR800Myr
and the surface density of SFR800Myr for the sample galaxy. In Section 4, we apply the calibrator
to the integrated quantities of galaxies, and examine
whether the calibrator can produce reasonable values of
SFR5Myr /SFR800Myr . In Section 5, we study the profiles
of SFR5Myr /SFR800Myr and SFR800Myr , as well as the
dispersion of SFR5Myr /SFR800Myr and SFR800Myr within
and across galaxies. We summarize this work in Section
6.
Throughout this paper, we assume a flat cold dark
matter cosmology with Ωm =0.27, ΩΛ = 0.73 and h=0.7
when computing distance-dependent parameters. For
convenience, the average star-formation over the last 5
Myr, SFR5Myr , is denoted as SFR7, and that averaged
over the last 800 Myr, SFR800Myr , as SFR92 , and the
ratio SFR5Myr /SFR800Myr is denoted as SFR79.
2. THE CONSTRUCTION AND CALIBRATION OF

THE CHANGE PARAMETER OF STAR
FORMATION
In this section, our task is to first construct and then
calibrate our change parameter based on the diagnostic observational parameters, EW(Hα), EW(Hδ A ), and
Dn (4000).
2.1. The star-formation change parameter SFR79
The relatively long timescales for the formation of individual stars means that measurements of the rate of
star-formation must necessarily represent averages over
some even longer timescale, say 107 years. Ideally, we
would like to have a change parameter that reflects the
change of the star-formation rate, as measured within
some fixed time interval, e.g. 107 years, over some other,
longer, time interval, say 109 years. Unfortunately this
is not possible with current observational material, and
it is in fact hard to see how it ever will be. Practicalities
therefore force us to instead compare the star-formation
rates that are obtained by averaging over different periods of time prior to the epoch of observation, e.g. to
compare the star-formation rate averaged over the previous 5 Myr with that averaged over the previous 800
Myr. As noted above, we adopt a shorthand of SFR7
and SFR9 for these quantities, with the ratio denoted by
SFR79.
The ratio SFR79 therefore mixes information both on
short term (107 year) variations in the SFR, i.e. on the
“burstiness” of star-formation, with longer-term drifts in
the SFR of the galaxy taking place on longer timescales
(109 year). For this reason we prefer to think of the ratio SFR7/SFR9 as a star-formation “change parameter”
rather than simply as a measure of the “burstiness” of the
star-formation. To think of “bursts” of star-formation
implies values of SFR79 greater than unity. This may
be appropriate for some subset of the galaxy population,
but within the overall population, we would expect to
find some values of SFR79 below unity, and indeed the
average SFR79 should be roughly unity. To be more pre2 This is because the 5 Myr is close to ∼ 107 yr, and 800 Myr is
close to ∼109 yr.

cise on this point, we would expect the ratio of the average SFR7 divided by the average SFR9 (which will not
be precisely the same as the average SFR79) to be unity,
modulo any long term evolution of the SFR of galaxies
with cosmic time.
A galaxy with a constant SFR will have an SFR79 of
exactly unity. A galaxy with constant sSFR will have
an SFR79 that is greater than unity by an amount that
depends on that constant sSFR, because the increase in
mass during the last Gyr will have produced an (exponentially) increasing SFR. However, this effect is small
if the mass-doubling timescale sSFR−1 is long compared
with 1 Gyr, as will generally be the case for galaxies at
the present epoch. This effect will be discussed further
below.
SFR79 will also give information on the movement of a
galaxy in the SFR-mass plane. If we neglect the changes
in the stellar mass over the timescales of interest, i.e.
if sSFR−1 >> 1 Gyr, then the SFR79 will tell us the
present location of a galaxy on the SFR7-mass plane
compared to the average position it has occupied over
the last 109 years. In this sense, it tells us whether the
individual galaxy is broadly moving up or down relative
to its SFMS.
2.2. The diagnostic observational parameters of the
recent SFHs
The basis of the calibration is that the three chosen
observational parameters contain information about the
(specific) SFR averaged within 5 Myr and roughly 1 Gyr,
and therefore the change parameter can be derived from
a combination of these three diagnostic parameters.
Here we briefly describe our overall approach to derive
the change parameter. The details will then be presented
in the following subsections. We first construct millions
of mock SFHs of galaxies. These mock SFH span the
whole of cosmic time and should cover as much as possible the range of SFH encountered in the real Universe.
We then generate synthetic spectra of these mock galaxies at the present epoch based on stellar population models for a range of different metallicities. We then measure
the three diagnostic parameters of interest. We also compute the actual SFR79 from the mock SFHs. Finally, we
search for the solution of SFR79 in terms of the three
diagnostic observational parameters.
The three diagnostic parameters have long been used
to indicate the recent SFHs on different timescales
(e.g. Worthey & Ottaviani 1997; Balogh et al. 1999;
Kauffmann et al. 2003; Li et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2017,
2018). In SF galaxies, the Hα emission mainly comes
from the recombination of gas ionized by photons from
extremely massive stars (>15M⊙ ), which is therefore expected to trace the SFHs within the lifetime of these
massive stars (∼5 Myr). However, the EW(Hδ A ) traces
the recent star formation within a longer timescale of
more like 1 Gyr. The Balmer absorption lines arise
from intermediate mass main-sequence stars with lifetimes of ∼1 Gyr. They are relatively insensitive to the
metal abundance because they depend mostly on the behavior of the main-sequence turn-off temperature rather
than the behavior of the red giant branch temperature
(Worthey et al. 1994; Worthey & Ottaviani 1997). Finally, the 4000 Å break is determined by the SFHs on

still longer timescales with respect to EW(Hδ A ), and is
found to be sensitive to the light-weighted stellar age
(Balogh et al. 1999).
The evolution of these three diagnostic parameters for
single stellar population (SSP) models of different metallicities can be seen by using the Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis code (FSPS; Conroy et al. 2009). FSPS3
is a powerful code that can generate spectra and absolute magnitudes of arbitrary stellar populations, with
a series of flexible settings, such as metallicity, choice
of stellar library, different IMF, and different evolutionary isochrones. Throughout this work, we will adopt
the MILES stellar library (Sánchez-Blázquez et al. 2006;
Falcón-Barroso et al. 2011), a Chabrier (2003) IMF, and
the Padova isochrones (e.g. Bertelli et al. 1994, 2008),
unless specified otherwise.
Nebular emission is produced by using the FSPS
implementation of the photoionization code, CLOUDY
(Byler et al. 2017). By simulating physical conditions
within a gas cloud, CLOUDY predicts the thermal, ionization, and chemical structure of the cloud, and further
produces the resultant spectrum of the diffuse emission
(Ferland et al. 2013). In FSPS model, the ionizing radiation is produced by a point source at the central of a
spherical shell of cloud, with assuming a constant gas
density of nH = 100cm−3 . The fraction of the ionizing
luminosity to escape from the HII region is assumed to
be zero (Byler et al. 2017).
For each of our mock SFH, we produce the currentepoch spectrum for six metallicities (log10 Z/Z⊙ =0.0,
−0.2, −0.4, −0.6, −0.8 and −1.0), without implementing any dust attenuation. This means that the diagnostic
parameters in the calibration are assumed to be dustfree. Being equivalent widths, the observed diagnostic
parameters should, ideally, be independent of dust attenuation, but this will only be true if the nebular emission
and stellar continuum have the same attenuation, which
is unlikely to be the case. There are likely be secondorder effects if different stellar populations have different
dust obscuration. The correction of the observed diagnostic parameters for these second order dust effects will
be presented in Section 2.6. Although we will only calibrate the SFR79 for the six discrete metallicities, we can
obtain the SFR79 calibration for galaxies of other metallicities by linear interpolation in log10 Z/Z⊙ (see details
in Section 3.1).
Figure 1 shows the evolution of EW(Hα), EW(Hδ A )
and Dn (4000) as a function of stellar age for SSP models
at the six different metallicities. We present the evolution of EW(Hα) (solid lines) and EW(Hδ A ) (dashed
lines) on the left panel of Figure 1. For all the different
metallicities, the EW(Hα) is scaled to 10000 Å, and the
EW(Hδ A ) is scaled to 10 Å. The two vertical dotted lines
represent the ages of 5 Myr and 800 Myr respectively. As
expected, after a single burst of star formation, EW(Hα)
is large at first, but then quickly decays and becomes
only 10% of its maximum value after 5 Myr, for all the
six different metallicities. In addition, EW(Hα) is higher
at lower metallicities. The dependence of EW(Hα) on
metallicity comes from the nearly equal contribution of
the variation in stellar continuum and the variation in

Hα emission.
For an SSP model with given metallicity, EW(Hδ A )
instead shows a peak at an age of a few hundred Myrs.
The stellar population age corresponding to the peak
EW(Hδ A ) decreases with metallicity. Rather than having a different timescale for each metallicity, we choose
instead a standard timescale of 800 Myr for all metallicities that enables the defined change parameter SFR79 to
be reasonably well calibrated at all the six metallicities.
This however makes the SFR79 calibration dependent
on metallicity. The Dn (4000) increases with increasing
stellar age at a given metallicity, and increases with increasing metallicity at given stellar age.
Our definition of SFR79 is based on the SFR across two
orders of magnitude in timescale, which is much larger
than that of the widely-used “burstiness” based on Hαto-UV ratio.
Further, as already noted the diagnostic parameters
based on equivalent widths are insensitive to the dust
attenuation and can be readily measured from the existing large body of optical spectra of galaxies, and are
not strongly model-dependent. These conditions make
the three diagnostic parameters to be an ideal choice to
study the variability of SFR in galaxies.

tion, Diemer et al. (2017) investigated the SFHs for individual galaxies, and found that the log-normal form fits
the overall shape of the majority of SFHs very well: 85%
of cumulative SFHs are fitted to within a maximum error
of 5% of the total stellar mass formed. The log-normal
works systematically better than the commonly used exponentially declining model, and appears to be a reasonably good description for the global shape of SFHs for
individual galaxies. Therefore we adopt the log-normal
fits of the SFHs for Illustris galaxies (Diemer et al. 2017)
as being representative of the global shape for the longterm variation of SFHs in the real Universe.
On top of these smoothly varying underlying SFH
must be added short-term stochastic variations. We describe the stochastic variations in SFR in the frequency
(or time) domain using the power spectrum distribution
(PSD) of variations in the SFR. To construct the mock
SFH, we use, for simplicity and following the work of
Caplar & Tacchella (2019), a broken power-law PSD to
characterize the possible variations in SFR that are superposed on the broad underlying log-normal SFH. The
PSD can be written as:

2.3. Construction of the mock SFHs
In parametric SED modelling, strong priors are usually imposed on the SFHs. One of the widely used ones
is the exponentially declining SFH (e.g. Bruzual A. 1983;
Papovich et al. 2001; Shapley et al. 2005; Pozzetti et al.
2010; Carnall et al. 2019), i.e. the SFR is assumed
to decline exponentially with some e-fold timescale τ :
SFH(t) ∝ exp(−t/τ ). However, it is clear in the real
Universe, that the SFH of galaxies may be much more
complicated than any assumed analytic formula. Motivated by the fact that the global SFD is well fit by a
log-normal in time, Gladders et al. (2013) proposed that
the log-normal form might also characterize the SFHs
of individual galaxies (Dressler et al. 2013; Oemler et al.

where ν is the frequency, σ defines the amplitude of the
PSD, α is the slope of PSD at the high frequency end, and
τbreak defines the break point where the PSD becomes
flat towards lower frequency. We refer the reader to
Caplar & Tacchella (2019) for more details of the properties of this kind of PSDs.
We then use a public IDL code4 to generate the random time series of variation in SFR with a given power
spectrum distribution. Note that the variations of SFR
are generated in logarithmic space. Figure 2 shows examples of the variations of stochastic components with
different α and τbreak . Here we only show the variations
with a time range of 2 Gyr, while in practise we gener-

ate the variation in time series over the full lifetime of
the Universe. Following the work of Caplar & Tacchella
(2019), the 1σ scatter of the variations are normalized
to 0.4 dex, which is comparable to the maximum scatter
of SFMS in the observations (e.g. Whitaker et al. 2012;
Speagle et al. 2014; Schreiber et al. 2015; Davies et al.
2019). The time resolution is set to be 1 Myr, which
is much smaller than the SFH timescale traced by
Hα, and smaller than the free-fall timescale of molecular clouds (Murray et al. 2010; Hollyhead et al. 2015;
Freeman et al. 2017). As shown in Figure 2, larger α
and longer τbreak result in slower oscillations and stronger
correlation in time domain.
In total, there are 29,203 galaxies in the Illustris simulation with stellar mass greater than 109 M⊙
(Diemer et al. 2017).
We do not yet exclude the
quenched galaxies, but will do so later in Section 2.4
based on the EW(Hα) and EW(Hδ A ) of the mock spectra. For each of these 29,203 galaxies, with a given underlying log-normal SFH, we then construct 100 stochastic
variations of the SFH by varying both α and τbreak in logarithmic space, ∆SFH (see examples in Figure 2). The
mock SFHs are then constructed by multiplying the lognormal SFH from Illustris galaxies with a factor 10∆SFH .
We therefore have 2,920,300 mock SFHs in total. In practise, we make a 10×10 grid for α and τbreak , where the
two parameters are evenly spaced with α in the range
of 1 to 3, and τbreak in the range of 100 Myr to 1000
Myr. The ranges of the two parameters are chosen ac-

cording to the result of Caplar & Tacchella (2019). Further, we find that the constrained slope of PSD is within
this range in the second paper of this series. For each
point on this grid, we generate a stochastic variation of
SFH based on its α and τbreak according to the approach
above. We stress that our propose is not to try to model
or reproduce the stochastic variation in SFHs in the real
Universe, but is instead to simply generate a huge range
of SFHs, which should cover the range of SFR79 that will
be encountered in normal galaxies in the real Universe5 .
2.4. Calibration of SFR79
For each of the 2.9 million mock SFHs constructed
above, we calculate the change parameter SFR79 at the
present epoch, i.e. the simple ratio of the SFR averaged over the last 5 Myr to that averaged over the last
800Myr. Using the mock SFH and the SSP models, we
can obtain the mock spectrum of the composite stellar
population produced by each mock SFH by convolving
the time varying spectrum of the SSP (at a given metallicity) with the detailed age distribution of each mock
SFH. We can further compute the three diagnostic spectral parameters for each mock spectrum at the present
epoch, for each of the six metallicities.
5 We will attempt to constrain the PSD of specific SFHs in the
second paper of this series. We find that the constrained slope
of PSD is ∼1.5 with assuming no intrinsic scatter of SFMS. This
indicates that the constructed mock SFHs covers the cases of the
SFR5Myr /SFR800Myr in the real Universe.

The time variability of star-formation in galaxies
In practise, we do not of course need to produce an entire high resolution composite spectrum but simply measure the relevant input fluxes (or flux deficits) of the SSP
once as a function of age from its evolving spectrum and
then produce the diagnostic parameters for each mock
SFH at the present epoch through a straight convolution
of these functions with the age distribution of the SFH in
question. For instance, the Dn (4000) is defined as the ratio of the flux density between the 4000 and 4100 Å (fred )
and that between 3850 and 3950 Å (fblue ) (Balogh et al.
1999). We first compute the evolution of fred(t) and
fblue (t) with time for a SSP at a given metallicity. Then
the fred (or fblue ) for a given mock SFH is the convolution of the corresponding age distribution n(t) with the
fred (t) (or fblue (t)) evolution curve. In the similar way,
the EW(Hα) and EW(Hδ A ) can also easily be obtained.
The bandpasses for calculating Dn (4000) and EW(Hδ A )
are defined in Balogh et al. (1999). Specifically, the blue
and red bandpass of wavelength (in Å) in calculating
the Dn (4000) are [3850,3950] and [4000,4100]. The three
bandpasses for the index of Hδ absorption are [4083.50,
4122.25], [4041.60, 4079.75], and [4128.50, 4161.00]. In
calculating emission (or absorption) line flux of Hα (or
Hδ), the contamination of the absorption (or emission)
in Hα (or Hδ) is corrected. We note that the approach in
calculating the three diagnostic parameters for the mock
spectra is exactly the same as that used in analysis of the
observations in Section 3.1 (also see Wang et al. 2018).
2.4.1. SFR79 as a function of EW (Hα) and EW (HδA)
Now that we have the measurements of SFR79 as well
as the diagnostic parameters for millions of mock SFHs,
it is straightforward to search for the solution of SFR79
as a function of the three diagnostic parameters. Figure
3 shows the log10 EW(Hα) vs. EW(Hδ A ) diagram with
the color-coding of SFR79 for the six different metallicities. The SFR79 shows clear gradients on this diagram,
confirming that the EW(Hδ A ) and log10 EW(Hα) indeed
contain information on the change parameter. For all
metallicities, at fixed EW(Hδ A ), the SFR79 increases
with increasing log10 EW(Hα); at fixed log10 EW(Hα),
the SFR79 decreases with increasing EW(Hδ A ). This
is as expected, since the two parameters indicate the
strength of star formation at two different timescales.
Another interesting feature is that the range of EW(Hδ A )
becomes smaller towards smaller metallicity. This is
due to the different evolution curves of EW(Hδ A ) for
the SSP models at the different metallicities (see Figure
1). For the lowest metallicity (log10 Z/Z⊙ = −1.0), the
EW(Hδ A ) of the SSP is greater than zero over the entire
age range of 10 Gyr after a single starburst. This is the
reason why there is no data points with EW(Hδ A ) below zero at the lowest metallicity. Note that EW(Hδ A )
is here defined to be positive for absorption.
After exploring many kinds of combination of the three
parameters, we find that a combination of polynomials to
the third-order can well reproduce the values of SFR79
to within a scatter of 0.06-0.09 dex. The form of the
polynomials can be written as:
log10 SFR79 =a1 × x + a2 × x2 + a3 × x3
+ b1 × y + b2 × y 2 + b3 × y 3
+ c1 × z + d,

(2)

7

where x = log10 EW(Hα), y = EW(Hδ A ), z = Dn (4000),
and a1, a2, a3, b1, b2, b3, c1 and d are parameters determined from the fittings. The fitting parameters for
different metallicities are listed in Table 1. During the
fittings, we exclude mock spectra with extremely low
EW(Hα) and EW(Hδ A ), since these are not encountered
in the star-forming galaxies that are of interest in this
work. The exclusion thresholds of these two parameters
at different metallicities are listed in the last two column of Table 1. As shown in Table 1, the threshold of
EW(Hα) is 1Å for all metallicities, while the threshold of
EW(Hδ A ) increases with decreasing metallicity, varying
from −1Å to 1.5Å. The exclusion of quenched galaxies
with very small EW(Hα) and EW(Hδ A ) is immaterial for
the present purposes. We also note that very small values of these two parameters would anyway be associated
with relatively large observational uncertainties.
Figure 4 compares the SFR79 as directly measured
from the mock SFHs with the results obtained from
Equation 2 using the three diagnostic parameters. As
shown, even though we included a huge range of possibilities in the mock SFH construction, the SFR79 can be
very well determined by the combination of these three
diagnostic parameters with a scatter of 0.06-0.09 dex.
The scatter shows very little dependence on SFR79 for
almost all the metallicities examined. Another interesting feature is that the scatter becomes larger with decreasing metallicity. This is due to the fact that we use a
fixed timescale of 800 Myr to define the change parameter
for all the metallicities. In principle, we could have increased the averaging timescale to ∼1 Gyr to reduce the
scatter in the calibrator at low metallicities. However,
this variable timescale would introduce more complexity
in analyzing the results in Section 4 and 5. We therefore
decided to keep the timescale constant for the different
metallicities. The chosen timescale of 800 Myr was selected to minimize the scatter of calibrators at the three
highest metallicities (log10 Z/Z⊙ =0.0, −0.2, and −0.4),
in which most of our sample galaxies are in fact located
(see Section 2.4.2).
2.4.2. The performance of the calibrator
We showed in the above subsection that SFR79 could
be calibrated with an overall uncertainty of 0.06-0.09 dex.
In this subsection, we examine the performance of the
calibrator in the log10 EW(Hα) vs. EW(Hδ A ) diagram,
to examine the performance of the SFR79 estimator in
different regions of the diagram.
We show the log10 EW(Hα) vs. EW(Hδ A ) diagram for
the mock SFHs with the color-coding of the ∆SFR79 in
the top group of panels in Figure 5. The ∆SFR79 is defined as the difference between the SFR79 from Equation
2 and the true SFR79 in the mock SFHs. At each metallicity, we also present the distribution of the spaxels from
the MaNGA SF galaxies (of the corresponding metallicity, with bins of width of 0.2 dex) on the log10 EW(Hα)
vs. EW(Hδ A ) diagram, shown in black contours. The
stellar metallicity of the sample galaxies is taken from
the empirical mass-metallicity relation from Zahid et al.
(2017) (see Equation 4 in Section 3.1). Most of the sample galaxies are in the three highest metallicity bins, and
there are no contours in the two lowest metallicity bins.
This is because the number of spaxels in the two lowest

metallicity bins are quite limited (only one galaxy in the
sample has a metallicity in each of these two lowest bins).
As shown, the calibration formula can indeed give an
excellent estimation of SFR79. However, we note that
the estimator does not work well when EW(Hδ A ) and
EW(Hα) lie beyond the threshold criteria of the calibrator (see the shaded regions of Figure 5 and also Table 1).
In addition, although our mock SFHs cover a very wide
range on the diagram of log10 EW(Hα) vs. EW(Hδ A ),
some regions of parameter space are still not covered
(the white regions in Figure 5). The calibration polynomial is clearly not valid for the data points that are
beyond the colored regions. This limitation does not affect our application to MaNGA galaxies, because almost
all the spaxels of the SF galaxies in MaNGA are within
the regions of validity for the estimator (see the black
contours).

At the three lowest metallicities, the estimator appears
to systematically underestimate the SFR79 by up to ∼0.1
dex at the high EW(Hδ A ) end (see yellow and red colors at high EW(Hδ A ) in Figure 5). This may be due
to the fact that at the edge of the parameter space, the
number density of mock SFH is relative low, which contribute a small weight during the fitting. However, this
systematic deviation in the calibrator is not a problem,
since it can be easily corrected based on the position of
the log10 EW(Hα)-EW(Hδ A ) diagram in the application.
We perform this correction in applying the calibrator to
MaNGA galaxies. We note that this correction is very
minor, since in the observation almost all the data points
from MaNGA located in the regions that the calibrator
operates rather well.
In principle, we could of course simply establish a lookup table for SFR79 over the whole range of the three di-

but increases somewhat to lower metallicities because of the variation of EW(HδA )(t) shown in Figure 1.

agnostic parameters, so as to avoid the above correction.
However, in this work, we prefer to present a simple empirical formula of SFR79 which can be used by readers.
We show the scatter in ∆SFR79 on the log10 EW(Hα)
vs. EW(Hδ A ) diagram in the bottom group of panels
in Figure 5. As a whole, for all the metallicities explored, the scatter of the calibrator is small at the high
end of both log10 EW(Hα) and EW(Hδ A ), and increases
towards the lower end of log10 EW(Hα) and EW(Hδ A ).
This may be due to the fact that for high log10 EW(Hα)
and EW(Hδ A ) (corresponding to high recent SFRs), the
contribution from the older stellar populations in the
measurement of these two parameters is correspondingly
small. With increasing metallicity, the scatter decreases
as a whole, which is likely due to the timescale of 800
Myr in definition of the change parameter for all the
metallicities discussed above.
Based on the bottom panels of Figure 5, we assign an
uncertainty in the SFR79 according to the location on
the log10 EW(Hα) vs. EW(Hδ A ) diagram in the application of the calibrator. While the scatter of SFR79 in the
mock SFHs may over-estimate the uncertainty of SFR79
for an individual galaxy because the mock SFHs may
contain not found ones in the real Universe, we think that

this is a more reasonable approach than simply assigning
a constant uncertainty of SFR79 at a given metallicity
based on Figure 4. Since this uncertainty is due to the
estimator itself, we refer to this uncertainty as “model
uncertainty”. This is distinct from the uncertainty due
to measurement uncertainties of the three diagnostic parameters from the observations (see Section 4.1).
2.5. The effect of changing the IMF and the
evolutionary isochrones
In deriving the calibration for SFR79 we assumed
for each mock galaxy the same, non-evolving, IMF of
Chabrier (2003). This assumption may not be the case in
the real Universe. In principle, a time-varying IMF and
a time-varying SFH are deeply degenerate, since we have
no way of knowing when stars below the stellar Main
Sequence turn-off stars produced. We do not consider
this issue further in the current work, but this should
not be a problem unless the cosmic evolution of the IMF
was significant in the last ∼1 Gyr (the timescale used in
definition of the change parameter), which we consider
unlikely.
However, the IMF may also be different from galaxy
to galaxy, or even in different parts of the same galaxy.

log10 EW(Hα) vs. EW(HδA ) diagram for the mock galaxies at the six metallicities. The recovered SFR79 is calculated based on Equation
2. This means that the Dn (4000) is also included in calculating SFR79, although here we only present the dependence of EW(Hα) and
EW(HδA ). The shaded regions are considered to be beyond the valid regions of the calibrator (see also Table 1). In each panel, the black
contours show the distribution of the spaxels from the MaNGA SF galaxies of the corresponding metallicity. The observed EW(Hα) and
EW(HδA ) of MaNGA spaxels are corrected for the dust attenuation according to the approach described in Section 2.6. The black contours
enclose 30%, 50%, 70% and 90% of spaxels from the inside outwards.

The time variability of star-formation in galaxies

tion with respect to the use of different stellar evolution
model, i.e. the isochrones. In the similar way, we generate a new calibrator by adopting the MIST isochrone
(e.g. Paxton et al. 2011; Choi et al. 2016; Dotter 2016;
Paxton et al. 2018) with all other settings unchanged.
The result is shown in the bottom panel of Figure 6.
Again we see that the use of MIST isochrones introduces
a small systematic offset of −0.09 dex.
While these effects introduce systematic offsets to
SFR79, this will not affect the investigation of the temporal variation of SFR in galaxy populations, because it
is the scatter of SFR79 that characterizes this variation,
rather than the average value (Broussard et al. 2019). A
significant problem would occur only if the IMF or the
appropriate isochrones varied significantly from galaxy
to galaxy. While the former is possible, the latter is presumably not. We note at this point that the variation
with IMF (systematic offsets of 0.05 dex) is rather small
compared with the observed dispersion in SFR79 within
the population, which is 0.23 dex (see Section 4 below).
So, we can assume that any variations in IMF are probably a negligible contributor to this scatter.

Fig. 6.— The impact of changing the IMF and evolutionary
isochrones on the calibration of SFR79 for MaNGA galaxies with
stellar mass greater than 1010 M⊙ . Upper panel: the SFR79 calibrated for Padova isochrones and the Chabrier IMF versus the
SFR79 calibrated with same isochrones and the Salpeter IMF.
Lower panels: the SFR79 calibrated with the Padova isochrones
and the Chabrier IMF versus the SFR79 calibrated with MIST
isochrones and the same IMF. In the upper panel, the red line is
parallel to but 0.05 dex above the one-to-one line, while in the lower
panel, the red line is parallel to but 0.09 dex below the one-to-one
line, indicating that the effects of these two changes is to introduce
a uniform offset in SFR79.

Based on a very sensitive index of the IMF, 13 CO/C18 O,
Zhang et al. (2018) found evidence of a top-heavy stellar
IMF (with respect to Chabrier IMF) in the dusty starburst galaxies at redshift ∼2-3.
In this subsection, we examine the stability of our calibrator with different IMFs, choosing to do this, for simplicity, only at a single (solar) metallicity. Based on the
same approach in Section 2.3 and 2.4, we construct a
new calibration of SFR79 using a Salpeter IMF (Salpeter
1955) without changing the other settings. Then we compare the two calibrators by applying them to a sample of
MaNGA galaxies with stellar mass greater than 1010 M⊙ .
The three diagnostic parameters of MaNGA galaxies are
calculated based on the spectra binned within the effective radius. Details of the binning scheme are in Section 3.4. Note that the three diagnostic parameters are
corrected for the dust attenuation, according to the approach in Section 2.6. As shown in the top panel of Figure 6, the change of IMF gives the same result but with a
systematic offset of about 0.05 dex. It is to be expected
that a change in the IMF produces a systematic offset
in SFR79 because both IMF and SFR79 will change the
relative number of stars of different masses.
In our work, the absolute value of SFR79 is of less interest than the dispersion in SFR79. Therefore we argue
that the choice of IMF is, at least within the range of
plausible possibilities, not important.
We next examine the stability of the SFR79 calibra-

2.6. Correction for dust attenuation
As described above, we did not include the effects
of dust attenuation in the calibration of SFR79. This
means that any correction for dust attenuation correction must be made to the three observational parameters before feeding them into the SFR79 calibration.
As already noted, the use of equivalent widths makes
them relatively insensitive to extinction. However, differential extinction between stars of different ages, or between line and continuum emission is more of a problem.
Newly formed stars (< 10 Myr) may have different extinction than older stars, since the extinctions of stellar
continuum and of nebular emission are usually different
(e.g. Calzetti et al. 2000; Moustakas & Kennicutt 2006;
Wild et al. 2011; Hemmati et al. 2015). Charlot & Fall
(2000) proposed a two-component dust model, where
the optical depth for stellar populations older than 10
Myr is around one-third of the optical depth of stellar populations younger than 10 Myr. In this model,
the regions of young stellar populations are more dusty
than the regions of older stellar populations, because the
newly formed stars are embedded in molecular clouds.
The demarcation timescale of 10 Myr comes from the
timescale of disruption of molecular clouds (Blitz & Shu
1980; Murray et al. 2010; Conroy et al. 2009). In this
work, we make the same assumption of this stellar age dependent dust model, and we adopt the Cardelli-ClaytonMathis (CCM) dust attenuation curve (Cardelli et al.
1989).
With this dust model, we correct the dust attenuation of the three diagnostic parameters in the following way. First, we generate as before mock SFHs based
on the SFHs of Illustris galaxies adding stochastic processes, but here adopt a broken power-law PSD of SFHs
with α =1.5 and τbreak =20 Gyr (The large τbreak make
the PSD close to a single power-law PSD with α=1.5).
And again, the scatter of the variations are normalized
to 0.4 dex. In contrast to the situation in Section 2.3,
we here try to generate SFHs that resemble the observations, rather than a huge range of all possibible SFH.
A power-law PSD with α =1.5 is likely a good descrip-

tion of the stochasticity of SFHs without considering the
intrinsic scatter of the SFMS, according to the analysis of our second paper of this series. Actually, in the
second paper, we will find that, if we assume a single
power-law form for the PSD of the specific SFH, a slope
of 1.5 is the best to reproduce the distribution of galaxies on the ∆sSFR7-∆sSFR9 plane 6 . The slope of PSD
adopted here is slightly shallower than the one assumed
in Caplar & Tacchella (2019), who assumed a PSD index
of 2, corresponding to a random walk process. We refer
the reader to the second paper of this series for details.
We then calculate two sets of diagnostic observational
parameters based on the mock SFHs with and without
the dust attenuation. For the mock spectra, we know the
contribution of the stellar populations at different ages,
from the mock SFHs and evolving spectra of the SSP
models. This enables us to apply a stellar-age-dependent
extinction model to obtain the reddened spectra and the
values of the three diagnostic parameters. The diagnostic parameters with dust reddening are denoted as
Dn (4000)dust , EW(Hδ A )dust and EW(Hδ A )dust . In this
process, we assign for each galaxy an E(B−V)young 7 , i.e.

populations (E(B−V)old ) is

the E(B−V) for the stellar population younger than 10
Myr, that is randomly distributed between 0.0 and 1.0.
At last, we compare the two set of observed parameters
and define recipes for the correction.
After exploring many forms for the dust correction
of the three observational parameters, we found good
expressions with rather small uncertainties. Figure 7
presents the formulae to correct the dust attenuation
(solid red lines) by comparing the two set of diagnostic parameters at solar metallicity. The correction of
EW(Hα) and Dn (4000) are a function of E(B−V)young ,
while the correction of EW(Hδ A ) is a function of both
E(B−V)young and EW(Hα). In the observation, the
E(B−V)young can be determined from the flux ratio of
Hα and Hβ using the Balmer decrement. The adopted
expressions for the correction for the three parameters
are as follows:
log10 EW(Hα )/EW(Hα )dust =p1 × E(B − V)young
EW(HδA ) − EW(HδA )dust =p2 × E(B − V)p3

The time variability of star-formation in galaxies
where p1, p2, p3, p4, and p5 are parameters determined by fitting. Table 2 shows these fitting parameters to be used in Equation 3, as well as the resulting
uncertainties of the observational diagnostic parameters
(listed in the last three columns in Table 2) produced by
the dust attenuation correction, at different metallicities.
The uncertainties are determined by the scatters in the
three panels of Figure 7. As can be seen in Table 2, the
uncertainties due to this correction are small.
However, there may be additional uncertainties
in the dust attenuation correction, due to possible
variations in the f-factor (e.g. Kashino et al. 2013;
Lin & Kong 2019; Faisst et al. 2019), defined as the
E(B−V)star /E(B−V)nebular8 , from galaxy to galaxy or
from regions to regions. This effect is not included in
our dust model in the present work. Specifically, by
using the MaNGA galaxies, Lin & Kong (2019) found
that the f-factor decreases with increasing stellar mass,
and slightly increases with increasing sSFR. For most
of SF spaxels in galaxies above 1010 M⊙ , the f-factor is
in the range of 0.3-0.7 with a scatter of ∼0.1-0.15. We
have examined the dependence of our SFR79 estimator
on the value of E(B−V)old /E(B−V)young at solar metallicity. Increasing E(B−V)old /E(B−V)young by 0.1, the
resulting SFR79 show an overall 0.03 dex offset with respect to the old ones, which is much smaller than the
scatter of SFR79 (0.23 dex) we measured in Section 4.
We conclude that the dust attenuation corrections of the
three parameters are only a secondary effect due to the
fact that they are relative values measured at fixed wavelength. The uncertainty of the dust attenuation is even
much smaller than the value of the applied correction for
the three parameters, and is therefore not likely to be a
big concern.

3.1. The sample galaxies and the measurement of
parameters
MaNGA is one of the largest integral field spectroscopic surveys, aiming at obtaining the two-dimensional
spectra for ∼10,000 galaxies in the redshift range of
0.01 < z < 0.15 (Bundy et al. 2015). The wavelength
covered by MaNGA is 3600-10300 Å at a spectral resolution R ∼2000, which is sufficient to accurately measure
the three diagnostic parameters (Li et al. 2015) used in
this paper.
In this work, we utilize the well-defined sample of starforming galaxy from W19. Here we therefore only briefly
describe the sample definition, and refer the reader to
W19 for further details.

The galaxy sample is originally selected from SDSS
Data Release 14 (Abolfathi et al. 2018), excluding the
mergers, irregulars, heavily disturbed galaxies, as well
as galaxies for which the median S/N of the 5500 Å
continuum is less than 3.0 at their effective radii. The
quenched galaxies are excluded based on the stellar mass
and SFR diagram. The stellar mass and SFR are measured within the effective radius, i.e. M∗ (<Re ) and
SFR(<Re )9 , based on the MaNGA spectra. Our final
sample consists of 976 SF galaxies, and is a representative
sample of SF main-sequence galaxies in the low-redshift
Universe.
The stellar mass maps of MaNGA galaxies are
derived from the public fitting code STARLIGHT
(Cid Fernandes et al. 2004), using SSPs with Padova
isochrones from Bruzual & Charlot (2003) and the
Chabrier (2003) IMF. The SFR maps are determined
by the extinction-corrected Hα luminosity adopting the
conversion formula to SFR from Kennicutt (1998), again
using a Chabrier (2003) IMF. The uncertainty in determining the SFR via this approach is 15% (or ∼0.06 dex),
due to the variations in the electron temperature in the
range Te =5000-20000 K (Osterbrock & Ferland 2006).
As above, we also refer to this uncertainty as model uncertainty.
Since in this work our purpose is primarily to investigate the SFR of galaxies on different timescales, we
denote the SFR directly determined from the Hα luminosity as SFR7, i.e. SFR5Myr (see Figure 1). The intrinsic extinction for nebular emission is measured based
on the Balmer decrement, assuming the CCM dust attenuation curve (Cardelli et al. 1989) and Case B recombination with ab intrinsic flux ratio of Hα/Hβ = 2.86.
The E(B−V) for nebular emission is then a good estimation for the E(B−V)young , i.e. the color excess for the
stellar population younger than 10 Myr. We note that
the IMF, isochrones, and dust attenuation curve that are
used to obtain the stellar masses and SFR5Myr are consistent with those used in Section 2.
The strengths of the emission lines are measured based
on the stellar continuum-subtracted spectrum by fitting a Gaussian profile to the lines. The Dn (4000) and
EW(Hδ A ) are directly measured based on the observed
spectra after subtracting emission lines, rather than from
the best-fit continuum spectra. This avoids the uncertainties of the measurements due to the possible systematic offset (especially at 3800-4200 Å) between the
model spectra and observed ones. For many SF galaxies, the bottom of the Hδ absorption is usually accompanied by weak Hδ emission, which make the EW(Hδ A )
difficult to measure. In this work, we take advantage of
the χ2 minimization spectral fitting code developed by
Li et al. (2005), which can effectively mask the emissionline regions iteratively during the fitting. This is critical to accurately model the absorption troughs and also
characterize the emission lines (see examples in Li et al.
(2015)).
Before applying our SFR79 estimator on the MaNGA
galaxies, we first correct the three diagnostic parameters
for dust attenuation based on Equation 3. Since both the
estimator and the dust attenuation correction depend on

8 The E(B−V)
star is close to, but not the same as the E(B−V)
for the stellar population with the age greater than 10 Myr.

9 Here the SFR is determined by Hα luminosity, which represents
the star formation within the most recent 5 Myr.

3. APPLICATION TO MANGA GALAXIES

In this section of the paper, we apply the SFR79 estimator constructed in Section 2 to spatially-resolved spectroscopic data from the MaNGA survey. In Section 3.1,
we will give a brief introduction for the sample selection
and the measurements of the relevant parameters. In
Section 3.2, we examine the consistency for the overall
change in SFR. In Section 3.3, we then derive a small
additional correction of SFR79 parameter to correct for
an unexpected apparent dependence of SFR79 on stellar
surface density.

the stellar metallicity of galaxies, we adopt the stellar
mass-metallicity relation from Zahid et al. (2017) to estimate the stellar metallicity of individual galaxies. The
relation can be written as:

 
γ 
Z
M∗
log10
= Z0 + log10 1 − exp −
, (4)
Z⊙
M0
where Z0 = 0.075, M0 = 109.79 M⊙ , and γ = 0.56. This
relation is determined by modelling the galaxy spectra with a linear combination of sequential single burst
model spectra. For a given set of three observational
parameters at given metallicity, we first calculate the
correction based on Equation 3 and Table 2 at the two
closest metallicities. Then we use linear interpolation in
log10 Z/Z⊙ to obtain the corrections of the observational
three diagnostic parameters at the required metallicity.
In the similar way, we then obtain the SFR79 using the
(dust-corrected) values of the three diagnostic parameters by calculating the SFR79 at the two closest metallicities based on Equation 2 and Table 1 then obtain the
SFR79 at the required metallicity via linear interpolation
in log10 Z/Z⊙ .
3.2. Consistency check: the overall change in SFR
Having calculated SFR79 for all spaxels in our MaNGA
sample, we can now carry out an important consistency check by calculating the total SFR of all spaxels in the sample, averaged over the last 5 Myr, and
the total SFR averaged over the last 800 Myr. These
should be roughly equal. To be precise, the ratio of
these, i.e. hSFR7i/hSFR9i, should reflect the overall cosmic evolution of the SFR of the SF galaxy population
over the last Gyr, i.e. the change in overall SFR of SF
galaxies that is implied by integrating the change in the
sSFR of the Main Sequence. The cosmic evolution of
log10 hSFR7i/hSFR9i that is expected for the ensemble
of main-sequence galaxies is calculated to be −0.025 dex
based on the evolution of the sSFR of the SFMS from
Lilly & Carollo (2016), and the stellar mass function for
SF galaxies from Peng et al. (2010).
The ratio of these two total SFR in the MaNGA data
(using our estimator of SFR79 to calculate individual
SFR9) is actually −0.066 dex, which is reassuringly close
(within 0.04 dex, or 10%) to the expected value. This
very satisfactory agreement should be taken as a first
confirmation that our calibration of SFR79 is quite accurate and certainly usable. In fact, given the assumptions that we made, however reasonably, about the effect of reddening, about the form of the IMF and about
the choice of stellar evolution isochrones, the very close
agreement to within 0.04 dex should probably be seen as
fortuitous. This is explored further in the next subsection.
3.3. Correction of a dependence of Σ∗
The top panel of Figure 8 shows the SFR79 for all
the spaxels in our sample galaxies as a function of deprojected stellar mass surface density (Σ∗ ) . The contours show the overall number density distribution of
spaxels in this diagram. These contours enclose 30%,
50%, 70% and 90% of all spaxels, from the inside out.
The blue dashed line shows the median SFR79 at given
Σ∗ . Based on SFR79, we can obtain log10 SFR9, i.e.

Fig. 8.— Correction of the presumed spurious dependence of
SFR79 on Σ∗ . The blue dashed lines show the median SFR79 at
given Σ∗ . The upper panel shows the raw SFR79 (upper panel)
as a function of Σ∗ for the spaxels selected from MaNGA galaxies.
Since, as discussed in the text, the increase with Σ∗ is thought to be
spurious, this median relation is used to correct the SFR79 using a
simple broken power-law shown with the red line. The lower panel
shows the distribution of SFR79 in the spaxels after this correction.
In both panels, the contours show the number density distribution
of the spaxels in the sample.

log10 SFR800Myr , for each individual spaxel of the sample
galaxies.
It is clear in this figure that the mean SFR79 appears to slightly increase with increasing Σ∗ , suggesting that SF galaxies have on average a slightly negative
SFR79 radial gradient. We suspect that this small effect is unlikely to be real, since it would suggest that
the SFR was declining more at large radii, leading to a
negative gradient in the rate of change of the sSFR of
galaxies. Since galaxies generally have a positive gradient in sSFR at the current epoch, this would imply that
this gradient was weakening. If anything, we would expect the opposite trend in any “inside-out” scenario of
galaxy evolution. There are other reasons to question
this small gradient in SFR79. Not least, although the
dust-correction is in principle computed locally, we did
not consider any radial variation of the form of the dustcorrection, nor of the stellar metallicity (e.g. Zheng et al.
2017; Goddard et al. 2017), nor any (possible) radial
variation of IMF (Gunawardhana et al. 2011) in the estimation of SFR79. We suspect that some combination
of these may be the cause of the trend in the upper panel
of Figure 8.
Accordingly, we therefore perform a small ad hoc correction to the values of SFR79 as a function of Σ∗ (only).
This is constructed so as to eliminate the dependence of

The time variability of star-formation in galaxies
SFR79 on Σ∗ , while not significantly perturbing the total rates of star-formation, as discussed in the previous
sub-section. We first fit the median SFR79-Σ∗ relation
with a piecewise linear function, shown as the red line in
Figure 8. The red line is in the form of

0.04581x − 0.6089, x < 7.5,
y=
(5)
0.1737x − 1.568,
x ≥ 7.5,
where y = log10 SFR79, and x=log10 Σ∗ [M⊙ kpc−2 ]. For
each spaxel, we then subtract this median SFR79 at the
corresponding Σ∗ . In order to preserve the total starformation rates, as discussed in the previous sub-section,
we then add a uniform −0.136 dex to the SFR79 computing this value to exactly match the log10 hSFR7i/hSFR9i
with the value of the cosmic evolution for SF mainsequence galaxies (i.e. including the 0.04 dex offset discussed in the previous sub-section). The bottom panel
of Figure 8 shows the SFR79 as a function of Σ∗ after
this correction.
This correction to SFR79 is of course quite arbitrary.
However, we stress that this correction only makes the
overall SFR79 profile flat, and does not change the scatter of SFR79 at given Σ∗ . Since the variability of SFHs is
indicated by the scatter of SFR79 across the population,
rather than by its average or median value, this correction will not significantly affect any of our conclusions in
the following analysis. In the remainder of this work, the
SFR79 for both individual spaxels and individual galaxies will be corrected according to the above approach.
3.4. The SFR79 maps and profiles
Based on the approach in Section 3, we can now obtain the SFR79 maps of each sample galaxy. Figure 9
shows an example of the measurements for one typical
galaxy (MaNGA-ID: 8249-6102). The top panels of Figure 9 shows the SDSS color image, Dn (4000), EW(Hδ A ),
and log10 EW(Hα) maps from left to right, respectively.
It should be noted that the three diagnostic parameters
are shown prior to the correction for dust attenuation.
The bottom panels show the maps of sSFR7, sSFR9, and
SFR79, as well as the profile of SFR79 for this galaxy,
from left to right, respectively.
As shown, the EW(Hα) map shows clumpy features
(blue clumps), corresponding to the regions with high
recent star formation within 5 Myr. However, these regions do not show high EW(Hδ A ), suggesting that the
star formation in these regions were not unusually active
in forming stars during the last ∼1 Gyr. Thus, the current star formation in these blue clumps of log10 EW(Hα)
map is triggered recently (much less than 800Myr). Consistent with this, these regions are seen as positive (blue)
on the SFR79 map that blue clumps are seen in the
same regions. On the other hand, some regions with
high EW(Hδ A ) but relative low EW(Hα), are visible on
the SFR79 map with yellow clumps. The star formation of these regions is reduced in a time scale much less
than 800 Myr. This simple example indicates that the
SFR79 we measured is indeed meaningful, and provide
the quantitative description for the above effect.
In the bottom rightmost panel of Figure 9, the small
gray circles indicate the SFR79 derived spaxel-by-spaxel
in this galaxy, while the red line shows the SFR79 profile
obtained from the binned spectra in annular bins. It can

15

be clearly seen that, between 0.5-1.0Re the distribution
of SFR79 is asymmetric: most of the spaxels have a relative low SFR79, while a small fraction of spaxels have
increased SFR79. This is due no doubt to the duty cycle of star formation. At any given time, star-formation
in a given region of galaxy is found in a limited number
of active regions, which themselves are active for only a
short fraction of the time.
In the current work, we do not wish to study the variation of SFR (or SFR79) that is caused by this small
scale local effect but rather focus on the variations in
SFR on larger scales. Therefore we use a binning scheme
to average out these small scale spatial effects.
The diagnostic parameters for a given radial bin are
calculated in the following way. For instance, for
Dn (4000), we first calculate the flux density of the blue
and red bandpass near 4000 Å as described in Section
2.4 for all the spaxels (with S/Ns greater than 3 at 5500
Å) in a given radial bin. The Dn (4000) of this radial bin
is then obtained from the ratio of the sum of the flux
densities in the red bandpass to the sum of them in the
blue bandpass, summing over all the spaxels in this radial annular bin. In this process, we also estimate the
observational error in the flux density for the blue and
red bandpasses. We first assume the flux errors of all
the binned spaxels have no covariance in obtaining the
binned error (σno,cov ). This error is obviously less than
the real error due to the covariance of binned spaxels
that arises because the spatial-resolution (∼2.5 arcsec)
of the MaNGA survey is much larger than the size of
each individual spaxel (0.5 arcsec). To correct this, we
adopt an empirical function from Law et al. (2016):
σcov
=
σno,cov


1.0 + 1.6 log10 Npixel
4.2

Npixel ≤ 100
Npixel > 100

(6)

where σcov is the error with considering the covariance of
binned spaxels, and Npixel is the number of binned spaxels. We then obtain the observational error of Dn (4000)
by error propagation. In a similar way, we obtain the
binned EW(Hδ A ) and EW(Hα), as well as their error for
a given bin. The E(B−V)young in a given radial bin is
also calculated based on the ratio of total Hα flux to total
Hβ flux within the bin. Finally, the SFR79 in the bin is
calculated with the binned diagnostic observational parameters using Equation 2, and the observational error
of SFR79 is calculated based on the observational error
of three diagnostic parameters via error propagation10.
The advantage of the binning scheme is 1) to improve
the accuracy of the measurements of SFR79, 2) to reduce
the variation of SFR79 caused by the small scale effect
discussed above (including the duty cycle of star formation). We set the radial bin width to be 0.2Re , large
enough to eliminate the scale effect, and calculate the
SFR79 and its observational error for a given radial bin
via the above approach. In the current paper, we focus
on the radial profiles of SFR79 for the sample galaxies,
and will not consider the local variation of SFR79 within
these radial bins.
10 In this process, we also combine the uncertainties invoked by
the dust attenuation in Section 2.6 for the three diagnostic parameters (see Table 2).

4. THE SFR9-BASED SFMS OF THE SAMPLE

GALAXIES
4.1. The SFR7-based and SFR9-based SFMS
We first examine the global SFR79 and SFR9 for the
sample galaxies and use these to examine the SFMS when
defined using the measures of star-formation rate on the
two timescales of 5 Myr and 800 Myr. Consistently with
the measurements of global SFR7 (i.e. SFR5Myr ) and
stellar mass, the global SFR9 is calculated for each individual galaxy by summing the flux in all the spaxels
within the effective radius to obtain the integrated SFR7,
SFR79 and thus SFR9 for the sample galaxies.
We exclude 16 galaxies that are located in the Seyfert
regions on the Baldwin-Phillips-Telervich (BPT) diagram (Baldwin et al. 1981; Kewley et al. 2006), based on
the emission line flux ratios within the effective radius,
since in these galaxies the Hα emission is largely contaminated by the contribution of the AGN. We also exclude
4 galaxies which have the three diagnostic parameters
beyond the valid range of the calibrator (see details in
Section 2.4). These leave 956 galaxies.
In the top two panels of Figure 10, we present the
SFMS based on SFR7 (left-hand panel) and SFR9 (righthand panel). In both panels, the blue circles show the
median SFR in different stellar mass bins. The black
solid line is the best-fit straight line to the median SFR7M∗ (<Re ) relation for galaxies with M∗ (<Re ) less than
1010 M⊙ . Following the work of W19, we define the
solid line as the “nominal” SFMS for SFR7. Interestingly, the line also matches the SFMS with SFR9
very well. This is consistent with the fact that the
evolution of the SFMS is small within the last 800
Myr (e.g. Brinchmann et al. 2004; Pannella et al. 2009;
Stark et al. 2013; Schreiber et al. 2015) and is a reflection of the fact that our average SFR79 is very close to

unity, as discussed above. We therefore adopt the solid
line as the “nominal” SFMS for both SFR7 and SFR9.
The typical errors of SFR7 and SFR9, including the
uncertainties from the observations and calibrator, are
shown in the corner box of each panel in Figure 10. The
uncertainty of SFR7 is 0.06 dex due to the conversion
formula from Kennicutt (1998). The measurement uncertainty of the Hα luminosity is negligible with respect
to the uncertainty in the conversion formula to SFR, and
therefore we do not show it in the top left panel. The
typical uncertainty of SFR79 is 0.076 dex, obtained by
combining the uncertainty from the calibrator is 0.063
dex, and the measurement error is 0.042 dex. Comparing
with the intrinsic scatter within the galaxy population
of SFR79 (∼0.23 dex), the measurement and calibration
uncertainty of SFR79 only broadens the distribution of
log10 SFR79 by less than 10%. This indicates that the
dispersion of log10 SFR79 in the bottom right panel of
Figure 10 is real, which provides the basic condition to
study the variability of the SFHs.
Comparing the top two panels in Figure 10, it is noticeable that the scatter of the SFMS is much smaller
when using SFR9 than when using SFR7. This is to be
expected. Averaging the SFR over 800 Myr eliminates
the variation of SFH on shorter timescales. It should be
noted that, as an extreme example of this, the SFMS
would have zero scatter, if the SFR was computed as the
average over the age of Universe. By examining galaxies
from the EAGLE simulation, Matthee & Schaye (2019)
also found that the scatter of SFMS becomes smaller
when using the SFR averaged over longer timescales.
4.2. The evolution of SFMS indicated by the change
parameter
Based on the “nominal” SFMS, we now define two parameters to quantify the deviation in logarithmic SFR

galaxies. In these two top panels, the blue data points are the median SFR in different stellar mass bins. The black solid line is the
best-fit line to the median SFR7-M∗ (<Re ) relation of the galaxies with M∗ (<Re )< 1010 M⊙ , which is found to be a good description of
the SFMS for SFR9. The dashed line in the left panel indicates the selection boundary of SF galaxies from W19. Bottom left panel: the

The vertical blue dashed lines show the overall median SFR79. The black dashed line carries over the selection criteria of SF galaxies from
the top left panel. In each panel, we show the median errors (including the direction of the errors) of the data points in the corner box:
the blue one is the model uncertainty, and the red one shows the uncertainty coming from the measurements from the observation. In the
top left panel, the median measurement uncertainty is negligible with respect to the model uncertainty for SFR7, and therefore we do not
show the typical measurement uncertainty of SFR7.

∆SFR7 and ∆SFR9 (in dex) of the galaxy, i.e. the vertical distance from the “nominal” SFMS (see Figure 10).
The bottom left panel of Figure 10 shows the correlation
between ∆SFR7 and ∆SFR9.
This plot contains additional important information
about how galaxies move above and below the “nominal” SFMS. An extreme scenario in which all SF galaxies
evolved parallel to the “nominal” SFMS would produce
∆SFR9 always equal to ∆SFR7, and therefore galaxies
would exactly follow the one-to-one line with zero scatter on the ∆SFR7-∆SFR9 diagram. We could imagine

the opposite extreme case, in which the scatter of the
SFMS is purely due to the variation of SFR on very short
timescales (<<800 Myr). In this case, we would expect
that the ∆SFR9 for all SF galaxies would be close to
zero, and therefore galaxies would lie on a flat sequence
with almost zero scatter on the ∆SFR7-∆SFR9 diagram.
For cases in between, galaxies would be located on a sequence with the slope between zero and one. The slope
and the dispersion of the sequence on the ∆SFR7-∆SFR9
diagram therefore indicates the relative contributions to
the dispersion of the SFMS on long and short timescales.
In the second paper of this series, we will constrain the

that is obtained for a series of SFHs that are parallel to the evolution of the SFMS, i.e. which have constant ∆SFR800Myr , as the black
solid line. The change in SFR, and thus in SFR79 due to maintaining a constant ∆SFR800Myr , is negligible. Right panel: the relation
between the SFR79-SFR9/M∗ in logarithmic space for the best-fit log-normal SFHs of the SF galaxies (sSFR7 > 10−2 [Gyr−1 ]) selected

comparison with the left panel, we broaden the distribution of galaxies in the right panel with the typical uncertainties from both models
and observations, as indicated in the bottom left-hand corner of each plot. The resulting dispersions in SFR79 are 0.08 dex and 0.23 dex
respectively. This comparison emphasizes that the distribution of the observed SFR79 in MaNGA is dominated by relatively short term
variations of the SFR that are absent in the log-normal SFHs.

not discuss this plot further here and refer the reader to
that second paper.
The bottom right panel of Figure 10 shows the relation
between ∆SFR9 and SFR79. The dashed and solid red
lines show the 16%, 50% and 84% percentiles of SFR79
for galaxies at different ∆SFR9. The lack of galaxies in
the bottom-left corner is due to the fact that the definition of our SF galaxies was based on the SFR7-based
SFMS (see the dashed line in the top-left panel of Figure
10). Galaxies (if any) below the dashed black line in the
bottom right panel of Figure 10 would not be included
in the sample selection.
As discussed above, the SFR79 parameter determines
the position of a galaxy on the SFMS (defined using the
SFR over the last 5 Myr), i.e. ∆SFR7, relative to its position on the SFMS that is defined using the star-formation
averaged over the last 800 Myr, ∆SFR9. This latter
quantity will to first order be the average ∆SFR7 over
the last 800 Myr. Therefore, apart from the small offset
due to the overall evolution of the SFR in star-forming
galaxies with cosmic time, the sign of SFR79 indicates
whether the galaxy is generally moving up or down in
sSFR (i.e. its present position relative to its average position over the last 800 Myr). Galaxies to the right of
the vertical dashed line in the lower right panel of Figure
10 are in this sense increasing their sSFR, or “going up”,
while those to the left are “going down” relative to the
SFMS.
We have already commented that the value of
log10 hSFR7i/hSFR9i is closely matched to the overall
evolution of the sSFR of the SFMS. We furthermore here
see in the lower right panel of Figure 10 that there is no

apparent correlation between SFR79 and ∆SFR9. The
absence of a correlation between SFR79 and ∆SFR9 is
required if the scatter of the SFMS is to remain more or
less constant over cosmic time. A strong positive correlation between ∆SFR9 and SFR79 means that galaxies in
the upper (lower) part of the SFMS would tend to move
up (down) with respect to the “nominal” SFMS, leading over time to an increased dispersion in the SFMS.
Similarly, a strong anti-correlation between ∆SFR9 and
SFR79, would lead to a reduced dispersion over time.
A roughly constant scatter of the SFMS is indeed seen
over a wide range of cosmic epochs (e.g. Speagle et al.
2014; Whitaker et al. 2014; Schreiber et al. 2015;
Barro et al. 2017), requiring that there should be no
correlation between SFR79 and ∆SFR9. The fact that
this is indeed seen in our SFR79 estimates is an important external consistency check that provides further
confirmation that our estimator for SFR79 works well.
Furthermore, it is noticeable that the distribution of
SFR79, at given ∆SFR9, is quite symmetrical about the
median value. This symmetry is in contrast to the pronounced asymmetry in SFR79 that is visible in the bottom rightmost panel of Figure 9. In broad terms, this
symmetry implies that, for an individual galaxy as a
whole, the timescales of “above average star-formation”
and “below average star-formation” are broadly similar.
As an example, short periods of highly elevated SFR superposed on longer periods of constant SFR would produce an asymmetric distribution in SFR79 with a peak
at slightly negative SFR79 and a tail to high positive
SFR79. However, we do not see this in the data (the
bottom right panel of Figure 10).
We return here to a point touched on earlier, namely
that a galaxy with a constant sSFR will have slightly

The time variability of star-formation in galaxies
positive SFR79. This is because the SFR increases as
the stellar mass increases. We show this in the left-hand
panel of Figure 11 which reproduces the data from the
bottom right panel of Figure 10. If all galaxies had a fixed
position ∆sSFR relative to the (slowly evolving) SFMS,
and experienced no other variability in their (s)SFR, then
they would lie precisely along the solid black line in the
left panel of Figure 11, displaced to left and right only
by observational scatter in determining SFR79. Because
the sSFR of the SFMS is low at the current epoch, i.e.
sSFR−1 >> 1 Gyr, the SFR79 produced by constant
∆sSFR is negligible for SFMS galaxies, essentially because the mass change of the galaxy during one Gyr is
negligible.
This emphasizes that the observed scatter in SFR79
within the population is completely dominated by timevariability in the SFR (and sSFR) of galaxies on
timescales of 1 Gyr or less, and not by a range of (unvarying) sSFR within the population. This is further illustrated in the right hand panel of Figure 11 in which we
plot the current-epoch SFR79 of the 26,485 log-normal
SFH of star-forming (sSFR7 > 10−2 Gyr−1 ) Illustris
galaxies from Diemer et al. (2017) that were discussed
above. These log-normal smooth SFH will by construction not have short-term variability. The SFR79 are
computed directly from the SFH, but we add Gaussian
observational scatter to the points to simulate the real
data. The dispersion in SFR79 of this simulated population of log-normal galaxies is only 0.08 dex (produced
almost entirely by the addition of observational uncertainties), much less than the observed dispersion of 0.23
dex. This comparison emphasizes that the much broader
scatter in SFR79 in the real MaNGA data is caused by
real short-term temporal variations in the SFR of galaxies that are not present in the log-normal SFH fits given
by Diemer et al. (2017).
5. THE SPATIALLY-RESOLVED ANALYSIS OF

SFR79
The SFR79 profile for each galaxy is constructed as in
W19. We divide the spaxels for each galaxy into a set of
non-overlapping elliptical annular bins with a constant
radial interval in deprojected radius of ∆(r/Re)=0.2.
For a given galaxy, we compute the deprojected radius
from the center of the galaxy based on the minor-tomajor axis ratio from the NSA (NASA-Sloan Atlas) catalog (Blanton et al. 2011). Then the three diagnostic
parameters, as well as the E(B-V) of the nebular emission are determined from the spaxels within each of these
annuli following the approach described in Section 3.4.
Figure 12 shows the SFR79 profiles for the
individual galaxies in five stellar mass bins
of 0.5 dex, from log10 (M∗ (<Re)/M⊙ )=8.5 to
log10 (M∗ (<Re)/M⊙ )=11.0.
Figure 12 shows that
the median SFR79 profiles (indicated by red dots) of
each of the five mass sub-samples are overall flat. This
is not surprising and would be expected since we applied
an ad hoc Σ∗ adjustment as described in Section 3.3.
Of more interest is the scatter in SFR79 within the
population, which is shown with the red error bars.
These show the dispersion σ(SFR79) computed using a
three-sigma-clip algorithm. We will return to this point
below.
In W19, we studied the star-formation profiles of this

19

same sample of galaxies. Specifically, we looked at the
radial elevation or suppression of the star-formation surface density (as measured on 5 Myr timescales) as a
function of the overall displacement of the galaxy from
the mid-line of the SFMS. We found that galaxies that
are significantly above the SFMS in their overall SFR
show enhanced star formation surface densities at all
galactic radii and that, conversely, galaxies that are significantly below the SFMS in overall SFR show suppressed star formation surface densities at all galactic
radii. Interestingly, we found that this relative enhancement (or suppression) of star formation is greater in the
central regions than in the outer regions for galaxies with
log10 (M∗ (<Re)/M⊙ )>9.5.
We illustrated this further by showing (see Figure 9 of
W19) that the dispersion in the radial SFR surface density at a given relative radius (for a given stellar mass
bin), which we parameterized as σ(∆ΣSFR ) in the notation of W19, strongly depended on the apparent effective gas depletion timescale. The depletion timescale
was estimated using different proxies (Shi et al. 2011;
Krumholz et al. 2012) rather than from a direct measure
of the gas content, so the observed trend could equally
well be viewed as a trend with stellar surface mass density Σ−0.5
or the other proxies used in these relations.
∗
We interpreted the W19 result as possibly reflecting
the dynamical response of a gas-regulator system to
changes in the gas inflow rate. We constructed a heuristic
toy model in which an idealized gas-regulator (Lilly et al.
2013) was driven by a periodic inflow of different forms,
either a sinusoidal function or the inverse error function.
The amplitude (and to a lesser extent the phase) of the
SFR response of the regulator system to this periodic
variation of gas inflow varies with the ratio of the driving period and the effective gas depletion timescale, since
the latter sets the response time of the regulator (see
Lilly et al. (2013) for details). The observed variation of
σ(∆ΣSFR ) across galaxies and the broad features of the
SFR7 profiles could therefore be explained through this
simple mechanism.
We can now use the SFR79 profiles derived in the current paper to extend this result in two ways. First, rather
straightforwardly, we can use the SFR79 profile to construct the ∆ΣSFR9 profiles of galaxies, to complement
the analysis of the ∆ΣSFR7 profiles presented in W19.
Second, and of more originality, we can use the SFR79
profiles to directly examine the temporal variations of
SFR within galaxies. This is an important point. In
W19, we interpreted the dispersion in ∆ΣSFR as arising
from temporal variations in SFR, but this was precisely
that: an interpretation. One could, at least in principle,
imagine that galaxies evolve in such a way as to maintain
a constant displacement of their overall sSFR from the
mid-line of the SFMS, with a corresponding constant offset in ∆ΣSFR7 . In this case, the scatter of the SFMS and
the scatter in star-formation surface density σ(∆ΣSFR7 )
could have nothing to do with any temporal variations in
the SFR of individual galaxies, but rather reflect “intrinsic” (i.e. time-independent) differences between galaxies.
The information on SFR79 in the current work allows
us to break this interpretational ambiguity decisively.
Significant variations in SFR79 can only arise because
of real temporal variations in the SFR within individual
galaxies. It is trivial that a constant SFR in galaxies will

always produce an SFR79 that is precisely unity. In the
previous Section, we showed that, while a constant sSFR
will produce values of SFR79 that deviate from unity,
these effects are completely negligible for the sSFR of
interest (see the bottom right panel of Figure 10). Unless the SFMS is a transitory phenomenon (which it is
not) the scatter in SFR79 within the population is therefore completely dominated by real temporal variations of
SFR (and sSFR) within individual galaxies. Therefore,
if the interpretation of the σ(∆ΣSFR7 ) relation that we
advanced in W19 is correct, then we should definitely expect to see a correlation between the dispersion in SFR79
with the gas depletion timescale.
In the next subsection of the paper, we construct first
the ΣSFR9 profiles and carry out a completely analogous
analysis to that of ΣSFR7 that was presented in W19.
Then, in the subsequent subsection, we then turn to examine the SFR79 profiles for more direct information on
temporal variability.
5.1. The profiles of ΣSF R9
The profiles of ΣSFR9 for each individual galaxies,
shown in Figure 13. For each galaxy, the ΣSFR9 profile is generated by combining its SFR79 profile (shown
in Figure 12) and the ΣSFR7 profile in figure 3 of W19.
When presenting the ΣSFR7 profiles in W19, we normalized the radius for each galaxy by dividing by the effective radius of the galaxy. This common procedure
removes the effect due to the variation of galaxy size
(e.g. González Delgado et al. 2016; Ellison et al. 2018;
Medling et al. 2018; Guo et al. 2019). However, more
originally, we also normalized the ΣSFR with (0.2Re )2 ,

i.e. computed the surface density of the SFR per area
of (0.2Re )2 . This ensures that the integration of a profile on a given surface density-radius diagram reflects the
actual integrated quantity in physical terms. In the current work, we therefore present the ΣSFR9 profiles in the
same way.
As shown in Figure 13, the ΣSFR9 profiles vary from
galaxy to galaxy. Analogous to the result of ΣSFR7 profiles in W19, the scatter in ΣSFR9 across the galaxy population shows a larger scatter in galactic center than the
outer regions (< Re), at least for the three highest stellar
mass bins. The median profile of ΣSFR9 (red dots) can be
well fitted by a straight line (the black dashed line), indicating a typical exponential star formation disk with no
suppression of star formation (or quenching) in the central regions of galaxies. The slopes of the median ΣSFR9
profile are −0.53, −0.58, −0.65, −0.65 and −0.67 from
low to high stellar mass bins, which are almost the same
to the slopes of median ΣSFR7 profile computed in W19
at corresponding mass bins. This agrees well with the
notion that star formation within main-sequence galaxies
varies in a quasi-steady state within an exponential disk,
ignoring other structural properties such as the presence
or absence of a bulge.
We split the galaxies in each stellar mass bin into four
quartiles of the global ∆SFR9, i.e. the position relative
to the SFMS as defined by the SFR over the last 800 Myr.
The thresholds of the quartiles for ∆SFR9 are listed in
Table 3 for each stellar mass bin. The top set of panels
in Figure 14 show the median profiles of ΣSFR9 for the
four quartiles in global ∆SFR9 for each of the five stellar
mass bins. For comparison, we also evenly divide galax-

ies into four subsamples according to the global ∆SFR7,
and present their median ΣSFR7 profiles in the bottom
panels of Figure 14. The thickness of the median profile indicates its uncertainty computed by the bootstrap
method.
It can be seen from Figure 14 that galaxies with higher
(or lower) global SFR9 show enhanced (or suppressed)
star formation surface density (within the last 800 Myr)
at all galactic radii. This elevation (or suppression)
in galactic center is more pronounced in more massive
galaxies. This result is entirely consistent with and analogous to the result shown in W19 for ΣSFR7 , that galaxies with higher integrated SFR7 show higher SFR7 at all
galactic radii.
Given the similar results in SFR7 and SFR9 in Figure
14, one might worry that this is somehow due to SFR9
being a derived quantity based on SFR7 and SFR79, the
ratio of SFR7/SFR9. However, it is easy to see that this
in fact makes the measurement of SFR9 largely indepen-

dent of that of SFR7. The former is ultimately linked
to the strength of Hδ absorption and the latter to the
strength of Hα. Clearly, if the Hα emission due to star
formation is over-estimated, for instance because of the
contribution of an AGN component, then both the SFR7
and SFR79 would be more or less equally perturbed. Ultimately the value of SFR9 is based primarily on the
EW(Hδ A ) value. The result in Figure 14 is therefore
largely independent of the analogous result in W19.
W19 defined a parameter, ∆ΣSFR7 , to quantify the
deviation from the median profile for a given stellar mass.
In the same way, we now define the deviation from the
median profile of ΣSFR9 to be ∆ΣSFR9 . Since the median
profiles of ΣSFR7 have almost the same slopes of ΣSFR9
(and also almost the same intercepts) at all the five stellar
mass bins, we use the same set of median profiles as in
W19 to calculate these deviations. We note that this does
not affect the measurement of the scatter of ∆ΣSFR9 at
a given galactic radius.

Wang & Lilly

We show in Figure 15 the scatter of ∆ΣSFR9 and
∆ΣSFR7 (the second is taken from the right panel of figure 9 in W19 for comparison) as a function of gas depletion time. As in W19, the gas depletion time (i.e. the
inverse of the star formation efficiency SFE) is calculated
based on an empirical formula from Shi et al. (2011), the
so-called extended-Schmidt law:

0.48
SFE
Σ∗
−10.28
=
10
(7)
yr−1
M⊙ pc−2
This formula is derived from integrated observations of
individual galaxies over five orders of magnitude in stellar mass density, but was found to also be valid for spiral
galaxies at sub-kiloparsec resolutions and low-surfacebrightness regions. In W19, we also presented another
empirical formula for the gas depletion time by using the
orbital timescale (Krumholz et al. 2012). Since the two
give similar result, in this work we only present the one
computed with the extended-Schmidt law. Each data
point represents one galactic radial bin within a given
galactic stellar mass bin, as in W19. The colored data
points are for the radii less than Re , while gray radii are
for the radii greater than Re . Here, we will only focus on
those regions within the effective radius as done also in
W19, because the outer regions are more likely affected
by environmental effects, such as ram-pressure stripping,
and etc..
Consistent with the result of W19, the scatter in
∆ΣSFR9 is also evidently a decreasing function of the gas
depletion time. The results on the SFR surface density
on 800 Myr timescales, ΣSFR9 , presented in this subsection extend and confirm the results on the SFR surface density on 5 Myr timescales, ΣSFR7 , discussed in
W19. The basic issue of whether variations in ΣSFR reflect temporal variations or intrinsic (time-independent)
differences from galaxy to galaxy however remains. To
resolve this issue, we now turn to examine the SFR79
profiles more directly.
5.2. The radial profiles of SFR79
The SFR79 profiles of the galaxies in the sample were
shown in Figure 12. We now divide the galaxies in each
stellar mass bin into four quartiles according to their
global SFR79 as measured within their effective radii in
Section 4. The top group of panels of Figure 16 shows
the median SFR79 profiles of the four quartiles in overall
SFR79 for each stellar mass bin. The thickness of each
line reflects the uncertainty of the median SFR79 profile
as computed via a bootstrap approach.
It can be seen that galaxies with high global SFR79
appear to have larger SFR79 at all galactic radii, and
galaxies with low global SFR79 appear to have lower
SFR79 at all galactic radii. This means that a galaxy
with a certain global change in SFR, i.e. an elevation (or
suppression) of the SFR with respect to the average over
the last 800 Myr, experiences a corresponding elevation
(or suppression) at all galactic radii. Furthermore, it can
be seen that, at least for the three more massive bins of
galaxy mass, this change (either elevation or suppression)
is more pronounced at small galactic radii.
In the bottom panels of Figure 16, we present the
analogous SFR79 profiles for the same five stellar mass
bins but now dividing galaxies into four quartiles of

∆SFR9, i.e. the position of the galaxies relative to the
SFMS defined in terms of the SFR averaged on 800 Myr
timescales. For all the mass bins, the SFR79 profiles
appear to be overlapped together, independent of the
∆SFR9. This means that the SFR79 profile does not
depend on the location of galaxies relative to the SFR9based SFMS. This is completely consistent with the result for the integrated SFR79 that was presented above
in Section 4.2.
These results in Figures 12 and 16 are consistent but
quite distinct from the result in W19. W19 found that
galaxies with higher SFR with respect to the SFMS show
higher SFR at all galactic radii. However, there was no
direct information on the temporal changes in the SFR
in W19, only an inference of spatially coherent temporal
variations in the SFR. The new result in the top panels
of Figure 16 allows us to look directly at these temporal changes. Galaxies with a larger (temporal) change
in their overall SFR, show larger (temporal) changes in
their SFR at all galactic radii. However, as shown in
the bottom panels of Figure 16, we do not find larger
(temporal) changes in the SFR in galaxies that have different overall levels of star-formation. This emphasizes
that the SFR79 parameter, characterizing the change of
SFR, gives a different perspective on galaxies than the
SFR itself.
We now return to examine the dispersion in SFR79
from galaxy to galaxy at a given relative radius within
a given stellar mass bin. This dispersion was shown in
Figure 12 as the error bars on each point and was computed with a sigma-clipping algorithm by iteratively rejecting points beyond 3σ. For the two lowest stellar mass
bins, it is evident that the scatter of SFR79 across the
galaxy population does not change significantly with radius. However, for the more massive bins in stellar mass,
the dispersion in SFR79 clearly increases towards the
centers of galaxies relative to the scatter in the outer
regions.
Since it is improbable that widely separated galaxies are varying coherently in their SFR, apart from the
slow overall “cosmic” evolution of the SFMS discussed
previously, the scatter in SFR79 across a population of
galaxies (at a given epoch) is, as discussed earlier, unambiguously a measure of the variability of the SFR within
individual objects. This is quite different from the scatter in ΣSFR7 , which could reflect temporal changes in
individual galaxies, but also, conceivably, could reflect
intrinsic (time-independent) differences from galaxy to
galaxy. Whereas temporal variability could only be postulated in W19 as an explanation for the correlation of
σ(∆ΣSFR7 ) with the depletion time, in this paper we are
able to measure temporal variability directly.
A clear predication of the gas-regulator model of
Lilly et al. (2013) is that the variability of the SFR in
response to variations in the inflow should strongly depend on the gas depletion time. Specifically, W19 drove
the gas-regulator system with a sinusoidal inflow rate,
and showed that the amplitude of the variation in the
resulting SFR (σSFR ) is the amplitude of the variation
of the inflow (σΦ ) multiplied by a frequency dependent
response curve. The response curve can be written as
f=

1
,
[1 + (2πτeff,dep /τP )2 ]1/2

(8)

The time variability of star-formation in galaxies
where τP is the period of the cold gas inflow, and τeff,dep
is the “effective” gas depletion timescale, defined as the
gas depletion timescale Mgas /SFR divided by the massloading factor of any outflow. As shown in Equation 8,
for a given inflow, a shorter τeff,dep leads larger variations of SFR, and vice versa. Although Equation 8 was
derived for an idealized sinusoidal input of inflow rate,
similar shapes of the response curve are seen for a range
of more complicated forms for the inflow rate (see details
in W19).
Figure 17 shows the scatter of SFR79 at different galactic radii as a function of the inferred gas depletion time
for different radii in the five stellar mass bins, computed
as described in the previous subsection. In Figure 17,
each data point represents one galactic radial bin at a
given galactic stellar mass bin. According to Equation
7, the inner regions of galaxies correspond to the shorter
gas depletion timescale.
As shown, we find that there is a tight correlation between the observed dispersion of SFR79 and the inferred
gas depletion timescale, with the shorter τdep associated
with the larger range of SFR79. The scatter in SFR79
from galaxy to galaxy may be taken as a direct measure
of the variability of the SFR in galaxies on timescales
between 107 and 109 years.
This new result is completely independent from that
presented in W19, but is entirely consistent with the
heuristic model presented therein. Regions with higher
SFE, i.e. with shorter depletion times, do indeed appear
to show a larger response in their SFR to changes in the
inflow (see figure 12 in W19). This supports the idea that
the dynamical response of gas regulator model to a timevarying inflow is the origin of the variation of SFR within
and across galaxies. This further supports the idea that
the narrow SFMS is indeed the result of the quasi-steady
state between the inflow, outflow and star formation (e.g.
Schaye et al. 2010; Bouché et al. 2010; Lilly et al. 2013;
Tacchella et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2019).
5.3. Discussion
Throughout this work, we have excluded the regions
that are located on the Seyfert regions on the BPT diagram in the analysis, because the contribution of Hα
emission by AGN would likely lead to an over-estimate
of SFR79 (see Section 4.1). However, some inner regions
of galaxies may still be contaminated by a low-luminosity
AGN, although this effect must be weak for SF regions.
The connection between AGN and the instantaneous
star formation has been investigated by many authors (e.g. Stanley et al. 2015, 2017; Harrison 2017;
Bernhard et al. 2018; Dai et al. 2018; Scholtz et al. 2018;
Schulze et al. 2019). Although both positive and negative AGN feedback have been proposed in the literature (e.g. Silk 2013; Bieri et al. 2016; Kalfountzou et al.
2017; Shin et al. 2019), convincing observational evidence for the impact of star formation by AGN is
still lacking (Stanley et al. 2015; Bernhard et al. 2018;
Ramasawmy et al. 2019; Scholtz et al. 2020). Therefore,
it is not clear to us what the SFR79 profile should be for
an AGN-host galaxy.
In addition to AGN, other physical processes have
been proposed to play roles in changing the instantaneous SFR via different mechanisms, such as the existence of bar (e.g. Wang et al. 2012; Lin et al. 2017),

25

and tidal/ram-pressure stripping (Gunn & Gott 1972;
Moore et al. 1996; Abadi et al. 1999; Poggianti et al.
2017). For instance, the existence of the bar can effectively transfer the cold gas to the galactic center, and lead
to central enhanced star formation (Lin et al. 2017).
We emphasize that our star formation change parameter, SFR79, allows examination for the change of SFR
in response to such processes. In contrast with previous
studies, the SFR79 characterizes the change of star formation with respect to the level in the past, rather than
to an assumed “control” population.
Many studies suggest that massive galaxies are assembled and quenched from inside outwards (e.g. Pérez et al.
2013; Tacchella et al. 2015; Abdurro’uf 2018). Under the
“inside-out” scenario, the profile of SFR79 would show a
drop in the center of “quenching” or “newly quenched”
galaxies (but see Lilly & Carollo (2016) for how sSFR
gradients can arise without differential radial quenching).
This seems at first sight consistent with the result in Figure 16, that galaxies with an overall lower SFR79 show
a significant drop of SFR79 at the galactic center, at
least for two highest stellar mass bins. However, we note
that our galaxies are all SF galaxies as defined with the
SFR7-based SFMS, which means that we may not expect to see the SFR79 profiles for newly quenched galaxies in our analysis. Instead, the SFR79 characterizes the
movement of SF galaxies on the SFMS. Furthermore,
analogously to our analysis in W19, galaxies with overall
higher SFR79 are also seen to have elevated SFR79 in
their centers.
Under the dynamical gas regulator model (Lilly et al.
2013; Wang et al. 2019), the amplitude of the change of
SFR is larger for regions of short gas depletion time, and
the change of SFR can be both suppression and elevation.
This is also in good agreement with our result. Therefore,
the drop of SFR79 in galactic center for massive galaxies
with overall lower SFR79, may have little to do with
quenching per se, and may be purely due to the drop of
overall inflow rate.
Finally, as discussed in W19, there is no need for any
specific physical processes that operate in the center to
quench a galaxy “inside-out”, such as AGN feedback.
Instead, the cut-off of the global inflow would naturally
lead to an inside-out suppression of star-formation, due
to the short gas depletion time in galaxy centers.
6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

In this work, we have introduced and calibrated a new
indicator of the change in SFR in individual galaxies,
SFR79. Observationally, this is based on the equivalent
widths of Hα emission and Hδ absorption, and the amplitude of the 4000 Å break. These three parameters are
good indicators for recent SFHs (Worthey & Ottaviani
1997; Kauffmann et al. 2003; Li et al. 2015; Wang et al.
2018) on different timescales. Specifically, the Hα luminosity traces the SFH within the most recent 5 Myr,
while EW(Hδ A ) traces the SFHs within the last ∼1 Gyr,
and Dn (4000) is sensitive to the light-weighted stellar age
within 2 Gyr.
The parameter SFR79 is equal to SFR7/SFR9, i.e.
SFR5Myr /SFR800Myr , where the subscripts refer to the
preceding time interval over which the SFR is averaged. Similarly parameters have been called burstiness in the literature (Weisz et al. 2012; Guo et al. 2016;

population. Our main results are summarized as follows.
• We have first measured the SFR79 of the whole
galaxy population, i.e. the integrated (over all
galaxies) SFR7 divided by the integrated SFR9.
This ratio was −0.066 dex, reflecting a small decline in the SFR. This is remarkably close to that
expected value (−0.025 dex) from the cosmic evolution of the characteristic sSFR of the SFMS. This
reassuring agreement attests to the empirical validity of our calibration.
• We have applied a small ad hoc zero-point correction to SFR79 as a function of the stellar surface
mass density, to remove a small radial dependence
of SFR79 that we suspect is not real and may instead reflect an uncorrected radial dependence of
the metallicity, or possibly the IMF.

Fig. 17.— The scatter of SFR79 as a function of the indirectly
derived gas depletion time. The different colors are for galaxies at
different stellar mass bins, as denoted in the bottom-left corner.
Data points with the radius larger than Re , are indicated in gray.

Broussard et al. 2019), but we find this misleading in
the present case. Our SFR79 spans over two orders of
magnitude in timescales, which is much larger than that
of UV-to-Hα flux ratio. As distinct from the ratios of
fluxes at different wavelengths, the three diagnostic spectral parameters used in the estimator of SFR79 are not
in principle sensitive to dust attenuation, even if some
effects can enter because of spatial variations in the extinction within galaxies. The change parameter SFR79
characterizes the changes in the SFR, in the sense that a
positive (or negative) value means an elevation (or suppression) of the SFR in the last 5 Myr with respect to
the average value over the last 800 Myr.
We calibrate the SFR79 by constructing millions of
mock SFHs spanning a huge range of different SFR behaviours, then generating mock spectra using the SSP
models for six different metallicities.
We find that SFR79 can be determined with an uncertainty of 0.06-0.09 dex for different metallicities (see
Equation 2, Figure 4 and Table 1). We also examined the
stability of this calibration by using a different IMF and a
different stellar evolution model (i.e. isochrones). These
only cause an overall shift of SFR79 and do not change
the distribution (i.e. also the scatter) of the SFR79.
We compute a small second-order correction for dust
attenuation that arise from a stellar age dependent
E(B−V) model from Charlot & Fall (2000). We assume
the E(B−V) for stellar population older than 10 Myr is
the one-third of that for stellar population younger than
10 Myr (Section 2.6).
We then apply the calibrator to a well-defined sample
(taken from W19) of SF main-sequence galaxies selected
from the MaNGA survey, and obtain the maps and profiles of SFR79 and SFR9 for each individual galaxies, using a metallicity taken from the overall mass-metallicity
relation.
Based on the new information, we investigate the variation of SFR79 and ΣSFR9 within and across the galaxy

• The global SFR79 (measured within Re ) is nearly
independent of ∆SFR9, i.e. the deviation from the
SFR9-based SFMS. This means that the movement
of galaxies (up or down) on the SFMS does not depend on their average positions on the SFMS during the last 800 Myr. This is required if the scatter of the SFMS is to be preserved over time, as
observed, since a strong positive (or negative) relation between SFR79 and ∆SFR9 would broaden
(or compress) the SFMS over time. This provides
a further empirical support for the validity of our
SFR79 estimator.
• The scatter in the SFR9-based SFMS is 0.26 dex,
noticeably smaller than the SFR7-based SFMS
(0.34 dex).
• Galaxies with higher (or lower) global SFR9 with
respect to the “nominal” SFMS, show enhanced
(or suppressed) star formation at all galactic radii
with respect to median ΣSFR9 profile at given stellar mass. In addition, the star formation in central regions of galaxies are more enhanced (or
suppressed) than outer regions (with respect to
the median profile), at least for galaxies with
M∗ (<Re )>9.5. These results are the equivalent for
800 Myr timescales to those already shown for the
shorter 5 Myr timescales in W19.
• Of greater novelty, we show that galaxies with
higher (or lower) global SFR79 appear to have
higher (or lower) SFR79 at all galactic radii with,
again, noticeably larger range of SFR79 in the central regions of more massive galaxies. This means
that galaxies with a recent enhancement in SFR
(i.e. within 5 Myr with respect to the SFR averaged over the last 800 Myr) have enhanced star
formation at all galactic radii (again, with respect
to the star formation in the past).
• Finally, in the most important result of the paper,
we show that the dispersion in the SFR79 across
the galaxy population, at a given galactic radius
and stellar mass, is strongly anti-correlated with
the inferred gas depletion time for these locations.
The scatter in SFR79 across the population is a direct measure of the temporal variability of the SFR

28

within individual objects, since it would be completely unreasonable to suppose that the temporal
variations of widely separated galaxies are coherent
(apart from a slow cosmic evolution of the SFMS).

In W19, we interpreted the observed dependence of the
dispersion of ΣSFR7 across the population with the gas
depletion timescale to be reflecting the dynamical temporal response of the gas regulator system to variations of
the inflow rate. This was because, in a gas-regulator system, the amplitude of changes in the SFR to changes in
the inflow rate is predicted to be strongly anti-correlated
with the gas depletion time.
In the current work, we are able to measure directly
these temporal changes by measuring the dispersion of
the change parameter SFR79 across the population of
galaxies. The fact that this dispersion is seen, once
again, to anti-correlate with the inferred gas depletion
timescale, further strengthens the case for the simple gasregulation picture of galaxies and for interpreting variations in the star-formation rate of galaxies in terms of
variations in the inflow rate.
The star formation change parameter proposed in this
work is a new parameter, which contains valuable information of the time-varying SFH for the galaxy population. It provides a new approach to study the physical processes that govern the SFR within galaxies on
different timescales. The SFR79 also opens a new window for testing models of galaxy formation and evolution
in future hydrodynamical simulations and semi-analytic
models. In the second paper of this series, we will explore
how the power-spectrum of SFR variability in galaxies,
i.e. the contribution of the variation in SFR at different
timescales, based on the result in the present work.
