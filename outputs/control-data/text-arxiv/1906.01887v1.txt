ABSTRACT
During solar flares, a large fraction of the released magnetic energy is carried by energetic electrons
that transfer and deposit energy in the Sun’s atmosphere. Electron transport is often approximated by
a cold thick-target model (CTTM), assuming that electron energy is much larger than the temperature
of the ambient plasma, and electron energy evolution is modeled as a systematic loss. Using kinetic
modeling of electrons, we re-evaluate the transport and deposition of flare energy. Using a full collisional
warm-target model (WTM), we account for electron thermalization and for the properties of the
ambient coronal plasma such as its number density, temperature and spatial extent. We show that
the deposition of non-thermal electron energy in the lower atmosphere is highly dependent on the
properties of the flaring coronal plasma. In general, thermalization and a reduced WTM energy loss
rate leads to an increase of non-thermal energy transferred to the chromosphere, and the deposition
of non-thermal energy at greater depths. The simulations show that energy is deposited in the lower
atmosphere initially by high energy non-thermal electrons, and later by lower energy non-thermal
electrons that partially or fully thermalize in the corona, over timescales of seconds, unaccounted for
in previous studies. This delayed heating may act as a diagnostic of both the injected non-thermal
electron distribution and the coronal plasma, vital for constraining flare energetics.

1. INTRODUCTION

Solar flares are a product of the Sun’s magnetic energy
being released and then ultimately dissipated in different
layers of its vast atmosphere. The release of magnetic
energy, initiated by magnetic reconnection in the corona
(e.g., Parker 1957; Sweet 1958; Priest & Forbes 2000),
is partitioned into thermal and non-thermal particle energies (e.g., Emslie et al. 2012; Aschwanden et al. 2015,
2017; Warmuth & Mann 2016), and kinetic plasma motions (‘turbulence’), a vital energy transfer mechanism
in the process (e.g., Larosa & Moore 1993; Petrosian
2012; Vlahos et al. 2016; Kontar et al. 2017). However,
the bulk of the released energy is eventually transferred
to the Sun’s cool and dense low atmosphere (the chromosphere) causing rapid heating, ionization (cf Fletcher

et al. 2011; Holman et al. 2011), and an expansion of
the lower atmospheric material - “chromospheric evaporation” (e.g., Sturrock 1973; Hirayama 1974; Acton
et al. 1982; Holman et al. 2011). The heated chromosphere, a thin and complex layer, is a prime source of
deposited energy information, mainly radiating in optical and ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths (e.g., Hirayama
1974; Kretzschmar 2011; Woods et al. 2006). Energy
is likely transferred in a variety of different, but closely
connected, ways: by flare-accelerated electrons, as evident from hard X-ray (HXR) observations (Holman
et al. 2011), by thermal conduction (e.g., Culhane
et al. 1970), and complicated by various plasma waves
e.g. acoustic waves (e.g. Vlahos & Papadopoulos 1979),
Alfvén waves (e.g. Emslie & Sturrock 1982; Fletcher &
Hudson 2008), Langmuir waves (Emslie & Smith 1984;
McClements 1987; Hannah et al. 2009), whistler waves
(e.g. Bespalov et al. 1991; Stepanov et al. 2007), and

then dissipated via turbulence, even in the lower atmosphere e.g. Jeffrey et al. (2018).
In the flare impulsive phase, X-ray observations (Benz
2008; Kontar et al. 2011b) suggest that non-thermal
electrons are the main source of low atmosphere heating and radiation. Bremsstrahlung X-rays provide a
relatively direct diagnostic of the properties of flareaccelerated electrons (cf Kontar et al. 2011b) in the
corona and in the dense lower atmosphere via HXR
footpoints (e.g. Hoyng et al. 1981). Higher energy
HXRs are observed to be produced in progressively
lower regions of the chromosphere (Aschwanden et al.
2002; Kontar et al. 2010) by electron-ion (mainly proton) collisions, and via electron-electron collisions above
∼300 keV (Kontar et al. 2007). However, electrons predominantly exchange energy via electron-electron collisions (cf Holman et al. 2011). Flare observations of
‘coronal thick-target’ sources (e.g., Aschwanden et al.
1997; Veronig & Brown 2004; Xu et al. 2008; Kontar
et al. 2011a; Guo et al. 2012; Jeffrey & Kontar 2013)
show that electrons with energies up to ≈30 keV can
thermalize in the corona in high density conditions.
However, more general statistical studies of large flares
(e.g. Caspi et al. 2014; Aschwanden et al. 2015) show
that the flaring corona, at least within the main phase,
is often a highly collisional environment. Further, it
is likely that non-collisional transport effects such as
turbulent scattering by magnetic fluctuations (Bespalov
et al. 1991; Kontar et al. 2014), beam-driven Langmuir wave turbulence (Hannah et al. 2009), electron
re-acceleration (Brown et al. 2009) and/or beam-driven
return current (Knight & Sturrock 1977; Emslie 1980;
Zharkova & Gordovskyy 2006; Alaoui & Holman 2017)
are also operating during flares, complicating the overall
transport.
For the last fifty years, the properties of non-thermal
electrons (their transport, deposition and the heating
of the lower atmosphere), are often determined using
the ‘cold-thick-target’ collisional transport model (hereafter CTTM) (e.g., Brown 1971; Syrovatskii & Shmeleva 1972; Emslie 1978). The CTTM assumes that the
energy E of non-thermal electrons is much larger than
the ambient plasma temperature T , and hence ‘cold’
(i.e., T  E). Although this assumption is valid
for high-energy electrons that reach the cool layers of
the flaring chromosphere, decades of observational evidence with e.g., Yohkoh (Tsuneta et al. 1991) and the
Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager
(RHESSI ; Lin et al. (2002)) show high coronal temperatures of 10-30 MK during flares. However, the lasting
appeal of the CTTM is its simple analytic form, that
can be readily applied to X-ray data, but its use leads

to the well-known ‘low-energy cut-off’ problem, whereby
the power associated with non-thermal electrons cannot be constrained from X-ray spectroscopy. Firstly,
Jeffrey et al. (2014), building upon Emslie (2003) and
Galloway et al. (2005), studied electron transport using
a full collisional model including finite temperature effects, diffusion and pitch-angle scattering, and showed
the importance of including the properties of the coronal plasma (its finite temperature, density and extent).
Critically, the inclusion of both thermalization and spatial diffusion led to the “warm-target model” (hereafter
WTM; derived by Kontar et al. (2015)) that can resolve the problems associated with determining the lowenergy cut-off in the CTTM, finally allowing the power
of flare-accelerated electrons to be constrained (Kontar
et al. 2019) from X-ray data. In a WTM, the properties and energy content of non-thermal electrons are
constrained by determining the plasma properties of the
flaring corona.
Here, using full collisional kinetic modelling, we reinvestigate flare-accelerated electron energy deposition.
As expected, we show that the coronal plasma properties
(e.g. temperature, number density and spatial extent)
determine how non-thermal electron power is deposited
in the chromosphere. Ultimately, we show for a given
non-thermal electron distribution, a greater proportion
of the non-thermal electron power can be deposited in
the lower atmosphere than predicted in the CTTM.
2. ELECTRON TRANSPORT AND DEPOSITION

IN HOT COLLISIONAL PLASMA
To determine how the energy of flare-accelerated electrons is transported and deposited in a hot collisional
plasma (i.e. in a full collisional WTM), we use the kinetic electron transport simulation first discussed in Jeffrey et al. (2014) and Kontar et al. (2015). We model the
evolution of an electron flux F (z, E, µ) [electron erg−1
s−1 cm−2 ] in space z [cm], energy E [erg], and pitchangle µ to a guiding magnetic field, using the FokkerPlanck equation of the form (e.g., Lifshitz & Pitaevskii

the distance between the X-ray coronal and footpoint sources is L ≈ 2400 . The determination of these coronal plasma properties
is vital for constraining electron transport and deposition. Figures taken from Kontar et al. (2019).

left the warm-target corona, and reached the cool ‘chromosphere’ (where a CTTM approximation is valid for
all studied energies). Using a time-independent equation with a constant source of injection produces output
variables with units of [electron s−1 per output variable]
i.e., E, z or µ, and the final results are reconstructed by
summing over all outputs at each step j. The derivation of Equation (1) and the detailed description of the
simulations can be found in Jeffrey et al. (2014).

Electron energy deposited into the ambient plasma
can be determined by considering

where Ej and Ej+1 are the electron energies before and
after each simulation step respectively. Using ∆Ej+1 (z),
a new ambient background temperature at that location can also be determined. However, we do not examine changes in background plasma temperature, and the
background temperature remains constant in all simulations.
Although derived from a time-independent equation,
we note that Equations (4-6) are
p related to a time step
∆t by ∆t = ∆s/v, where v = 2E/me is the velocity
of the electron, and the simulations can also be used for

used in all simulations, and E, µ and z are updated
at each step j. A step size of ∆s = 105 cm is approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than the
thermal collisional length in a dense (n = 1011 cm−3 )

Figure 3. (i) A cartoon showing the difference between low-energy electron transport in a CTTM and full collisional model
(WTM). In a CTTM, low-energy electrons might never reach the chromosphere, if they are collisionally stopped in the corona,
but in a WTM, such electrons are thermalized and can still transport a fraction of their non-thermal energy from the hot corona
to the cool chromosphere via thermal diffusion (orange layer in the chromosphere). (ii) Comparison of the time it takes a
thermalized electron to spatially diffuse from a hot coronal source to a cooler and denser low atmosphere, using different coronal
plasma conditions of number density n, temperature T , and the distance between the coronal source and the chromosphere L.
For solar flare conditions, i.e. T ≈ 10 − 30 MK, n ≈ 1010 − 1011 cm−3 and L ≈ 20 − 3000 , τD ranges between 1 − 100 s. Such
timescales are important in the WTM where non-thermal electrons partially or fully thermalize during their transport in the
corona and hence, transfer energy to the chromosphere on timescales of seconds.

2.2. Flare plasma parameters
We model the flaring atmosphere using a hot corona–
cold chromosphere type model (see Figures 1 and 2).
This atmosphere is a simple but reasonable description
of most flaring atmospheres. Moreover, a more realistic
atmosphere is not required since we only want to compare the results of the CTTM and WTM. This type of
atmosphere also ensures that a time-independent stationary solution is reached (e.g., see Kontar et al. 2015,
for details). Unlike the CTTM, electrons are no longer
lost energetically, but accumulate in the corona as they
thermalize. This pile-up of thermalized electrons in the
corona is balanced by the spatial diffusion of electrons
from the hot corona into the cool chromosphere, which
can be still considered a cold-target.
We perform simulation runs for two different “hot
corona – cool chromosphere” model atmospheres (see
Figure 2), including one model that includes a chromosphere with an exponential density profile (e.g. Vernazza et al. 1981; Battaglia et al. 2012).
The development of the WTM has shown that the
plasma parameters (the coronal temperature T , the
coronal number density n, and the coronal plasma extent L, where the temperature is high enough to be visible in X-rays) are crucial for determining and constraining the properties of flare-accelerated electrons (Kontar
et al. 2019). Here, we show how the plasma properties play a key role in the transfer and the deposition
of non-thermal electron power. We test how the energy
of non-thermal electrons is transferred and deposited in
a range of different coronal plasma conditions. In the
corona, we use different number densities ranging from
n = 3 × 1010 cm−3 to n = 1 × 1011 cm−3 , and plasma
extents (half-loop lengths L) of either 2000 or 3000 (see
Figure 1) between the hot corona and cooler chromosphere, leading to column depths of 1019 − 1020 cm−2 .
In the WTM cases, coronal temperatures range from
10 MK to 30 MK (see Figure 1) for solar/M-dwarf
cases and up to 100 MK for comparison with certain
extreme stellar cases (e.g. see Figure 3 in Aschwanden et al. 2008). In atmosphere type 1, in the cool
‘chromosphere-type’ region, the number density rises
to n = 1 × 1012 cm−3 and the temperature falls to
T ∼ 0 MK, i.e., it is approximated as a CTTM. In
the more realistic atmosphere type 2, the density at the
boundary of the cool “chromosphere-type” region is set
at n = 1 × 1012 cm−3 , but this rises quickly to photospheric densities of n =∼ 1017 cm−3 over ∼ 300 using

where nphoto = 1.16×1017 cm−3 is the photospheric density at the optical depth of ≈ 1, and here z is measured

is set at 000 .18 ∼ 130 km (e.g. following the simulations
of Battaglia et al. 2012).

In the CTTM simulations, we choose T = Tcorona ,
where Tcorona is the background corona temperature

atmosphere, we choose T = 0.01 MK for the calculation
of ln Λ.
2.3. The injected electron distribution
The source function S(E, z, µ) is made up of three
separate distributions:
1. Injected energy spectrum – we input either a monoenergetic distribution or a power law distribution of the form ∼ E0−δ . Electron distributions
with approximate power law forms are routinely
observed via X-ray observations. In the monoenergetic cases, we input electrons with energies of
either, the coronal thermal energy, 10 keV, 20 keV,
30 keV, 40 keV, 50 keV or 100 keV. In these cases,
we compare the outputs using Ṅ0 = 1 s−1 . For the
power law case, parameters of δ = 4 or δ = 7, a low
energy cutoff of Ec = 10 keV or Ec = 20 keV and
a high energy cutoff of EH = 50 keV are used2 . In
power law cases, the electron injection rate Ṅ0 is
set at a value that gives the total injected electron
power P = 4.8 × 1027 erg s−1 .
2. Injected pitch-angle distribution – we input a
beamed distribution (with half moving in one
direction and half moving in the opposite direction, i.e µ = +1 or µ = −1). We also run simulations using a completely isotropic distribution
(µ ∈ [−1, +1]), but for brevity the results are not
shown here. In general, the injected pitch-angle
2 Electrons with energies above ∼ 50 keV will approximate
the CTTM solution using the noted plasma parameters, and lowenergy electrons carry the bulk of the power due to steeply decreasing power laws.

Energy diffusion and the deposition of energetic electron energy in flares
distribution is not well-constrained by current solar flare observations (e.g. Kontar et al. 2011b;
Casadei et al. 2017). Collisional (electron-electron
only) pitch-angle scattering is always modeled in
the simulations. Further, it is very likely that
other non-collisional (and shorter timescale) turbulent scattering mechanisms are also presence in
the flaring atmosphere (Kontar et al. 2014). This
will also change how the electron energy is deposited spatially and temporally, and the subject
of ongoing work.
3. Injected spatial distribution – we input the electrons as a Gaussian distribution centred at the
loop top apex (z = 000 ), with a standard deviation
of 100 . It is possible that electrons are accelerated
to varying levels (dependent on the plasma conditions) at multiple points along a twisted loop (e.g.
Gordovskyy & Browning 2012; Gordovskyy et al.
2014), but again simulating all possible cases is beyond the scope of the paper and it is not required
for a CTTM and WTM comparison.
2.4. Timescales for the deposition of non-thermal
electron power
Unlike the CTTM case, in a WTM, electrons ‘stopped’
in the coronal plasma thermalize and then diffuse
through the coronal region in a random walk continuously exchanging energy with the background population. Ultimately, this means that non-thermal electrons
fully thermalized in the hot corona still transfer some
fraction of their injected energy to the cool lower atmosphere (see the cartoon in Figure 3 (i)).
Moreover, the time is takes for an injected thermal
electron, which is dominated by diffusion, to leave the
corona and deposit its energy in a cool low atmosphere

where K = 2πe4 ln Λ. This diffusion time (τD ; Equation 13) is comparable to the Spitzer thermal conduction
time (Spitzer 1962). In Figure 3 (ii), we calculate τD for
a range of different coronal parameters: T , n and L. τD
increases with increasing n and L, and decreases with increasing T (thermalized electrons in hotter plasma have
a higher thermal energy and hence reach the chromosphere quicker). For the range of plasma parameters
used in the simulations, τD ranges between ∼ 1 − 100 s.
Although, the thermal electron diffusion time τD can be
calculated analytically, it is not trivial to determine the
deposition timescales for non-thermal electrons injected
with E > kB T into different coronal plasma conditions.

7

Therefore, in each simulation run, we determine the time
it takes for non-thermal electrons of different injected
energies to deposit their energy in the lower atmosphere
using Equation (8).
In these simulations, we stress that we do not consider
the energy transferred from the hot corona to the cool
lower atmosphere from the background thermal plasma
by thermal conduction, which will play a varying role
in different flares and at different stages as the flare
progresses. Here, we only consider the energy transferred by non-thermal electrons, and in particular, the
‘extra’ component of energy that comes from partially or
fully thermalized non-thermal electrons now being able
to reach the lower atmosphere from diffusion.
In the simulations, we make several simplifying assumptions, such as: (1) use of single temperature and
number density in the corona, (2) a previously heated
corona and the use of a coronal ‘thermal bath’ approximation, i.e. there are no significant changes in the
background energy content due to the transport and deposition of non-thermal electron energy, (3) the use of
a ‘step function’ type atmosphere. Here, the assumptions are valid for a CTTM and WTM comparison, as
stated. Further, the thermal diffusion of electrons is
a fundamental transport mechanism always present in
flares (to a varying degree depending on the coronal environment), that is usually overlooked, even in FokkerPlanck type simulations where a full collisional model is
used. Hence, more complex simulations are not required
here, and they would hinder our comparison of energy
transport in the CTTM and WTM, which is the main
aim of this study.
3. SIMULATION RESULTS

3.1. Mono-energetic energy inputs: spatial distribution
of deposited power
Firstly, we perform simulations where we input different mono-energetic electron distributions into different
plasma environments, so that the results of the WTM
and CTTM can be easily compared for electrons of different energies in a range of different coronal conditions.
Here, in each simulation run, the accelerated electron
rate is Ṅ0 = 1 s−1 , for each input. We perform four
different sets of simulations labelled (a)-(d), using atmosphere 1 (see Figure 2):
Sets (a) and (b): different coronal densities- In sets
(a) and (b), we input mono-energetic electrons with
energies of either 10 keV, 20 keV, 30 keV, 40 keV,
50 keV or 100 keV. The injected electrons are initially
beamed in µ, and spread in z as a Gaussian with a 100
standard deviation centered at the loop apex. They
are injected into atmosphere type 1 (see Figure 2),

8

Jeffrey et al.

with either a coronal density of (a) n = 1011 cm−3
(Figure 4), or (b) n = 3 × 1010 cm−3 (Figure 5), a
half loop length of L = 2000 , and for all the WTM
cases, a coronal temperature of T = 20 MK (giving
E/kB T = 5.8, 11.6, 17.4, 23.2, 29.0, 57.9). All the WTM
and CTTM results are shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5
(showing the spatial distribution of non-thermal power
deposition in units of [keV s−1 arcsecond−1 ] and the ratio of the WTM to CTTM result for each run). Tables
1 and 2 show the percentage of non-thermal power deposited in the corona or low atmosphere in both WTM
and CTTM cases. From the results of (a) and (b) we
find:
1. In (a) and (b), the spatial distribution of deposition in the WTM is different from the CTTM
for all energies up to and including ≈ 50 keV, and
this difference increases for larger coronal densities
and smaller injected electron energies (see Figure
4 and Figure 5).
2. In (a) and (b), electrons can move further and deposit more energy at greater depths in both the
corona and low atmosphere in the WTM. This is
most obvious for low energy electrons (< 30 keV)
in a high density corona. Such electrons are collisionally stopped in the corona. The CTTM predicts that they deposit all of their energy in the
corona. In the WTM, electrons thermalize (or
tend towards a Maxwellian) and eventually deposit some fraction of their original energy content
in the low atmosphere (see Table 1 and Table 2 for
a comparison of the CTTM and WTM percentages). For example, in (a), an injected 20 keV electron population now deposits ∼ 20% of its available non-thermal power in the lower atmosphere,
compared to 0% in a CTTM.
3. The ratio of WTM to CTTM deposition is an
informative parameter that shows, in a single
given location, up to 100 times more non-thermal
electron power can be deposited (in both the
corona and low atmosphere), than predicted by
the CTTM, for a given injection of non-thermal
electrons (see Figure 4 and Figure 5).
Set (c): different coronal temperatures- In set (c),
we compare WTM and CTTM deposition in different
coronal plasma temperatures of T = 10, 20, 30, 100 MK.
We inject initially beamed, mono-energetic electrons
with an energy of 30 keV only (giving E/kB T =
34.8, 17.4, 11.6, 3.5), into atmosphere type 1, using
n = 7 × 1010 cm−3 and L = 2000 . The results are

shown in Figure 6 (left) and Table 3. From the results
of set (c), we find that:
1. For 30 keV electrons, the higher the temperature of the coronal plasma, the greater the fraction of non-thermal electron power transferred
to the lower atmosphere, with less deposition in
the corona (see Table 3). Electrons tend to a
Maxwellian, and in higher coronal temperatures,
thermalize at higher energies carrying a higher
fraction of their power into the lower atmosphere.
This dependence on coronal temperature is completely ignored in the CTTM.
2. Using atmosphere 1, at higher coronal temperatures, more power is deposited at greater depths
in the lower atmosphere, and the ratio of WTM
to CTTM deposition shows that at certain z in
the lower atmosphere, more than three orders of
magnitude more power can be deposited (see Figure 6 (left)). In the WTM, the decreased energy
loss rate in the corona means that electrons carry
more energy when they reach the chromospheric
boundary and hence, they can travel deeper into
the lower atmosphere.
3. It is possible that in high temperature plasma, if
a fraction of the injected electrons have energies
lower than kB T , then the electrons will thermalize
in the corona gaining energy and hence, deposit a
higher fraction of energy in the lower atmosphere
than suggested by their initial injected energy.
Set (d): different coronal loop lengths- In set (d), we
compare WTM and CTTM deposition in different loop
lengths of L = 2000 and L = 3000 . We inject beamed,
mono-energetic electrons of 30 keV only into atmosphere
type 1, using n = 7 × 1010 cm−3 and T = 20 MK. The
results are shown in Figure 6 (right) and Table 3. From
the results of set (d), we find that:
1. As expected, irrespective of the coronal loop
length, more power is transferred to the lower
atmosphere in the WTM compared to the CTTM.
The larger the loop length (greater column depth),
the greater time electrons spend in the corona and
hence, more electrons tend towards Maxwellian or
fully thermalize in the corona.
2. Although, more power reaches the lower atmosphere in smaller loop lengths, the difference between the power transferred in the WTM and
CTTM is greater for larger loop lengths. For example, for L = 3000 , only 0.7% of the total nonthermal power is transferred in the CTTM but in

Energy diffusion and the deposition of energetic electron energy in flares
the WTM this rises to 28%. Further, the ratio
of WTM/CTTM deposition at the chromospheric
boundary is ∼ 100.
3.2. Mono-energetic energy inputs: temporal
distribution of deposited power
In all simulation sets, we also determine how long it
takes for all of the non-thermal electron power to be
deposited in the flaring atmosphere. Firstly, in Figure 8, we plot the results of sets (a) and (b). On each
plot, we also add another simulation run where we inject
(beamed) thermal electrons into the simulation. Note,
that in the simulations, the injected electrons relax to
the flux-averaged mean energy 2kB T of the background
plasma, and a T = 20 MK corona gives 2kB T = 3.4 keV.
Figure 7 shows that in a WTM, lower energy electrons
E/kB T ≤ 11.6 can deposit their power in the lower atmosphere over a large range of timescales, and as expected the WTM result tends to the CTTM result when
E > 50 keV. These timescales are shown in Figure 8 for
both n = 1 × 1011 cm−3 and n = 3 × 1010 cm−3 cases.
In the WTM, many electrons still deposit their power
at times close to CTTM values, and WTM times converge to CTTM times as the electron energy increases.
However, in the WTM, lower energy electrons show a
large tail of delayed deposition in the lower atmosphere
(of seconds to tens of second), unaccounted for in the
CTTM, due to partially and fully thermalized electrons.
As an illustrative example from Figure 8, a 10 keV
electron will thermalize quickly in a high density corona
(n = 1011 cm−3 ) over a distance of < 1000 (over a time
of < 0.1 s). In the CTTM, 10 keV electrons in this
scenario never reach the chromosphere and deposit energy. However, in a WTM, once a 10 keV electron has
thermalized, it could travel hundreds of arcseconds in
a random walk, in the hot coronal region, before exiting into the cooler and denser chromosphere. Therefore,
depending on their path (the amount of scattering) and
thermalization time, electrons can now exit the corona
over a range of timescales from sub-second to tens of
seconds3 .
3.3. Isotropic injection
For cases where we input an isotropic electron distribution, we find similar results: more energy is deposited
in the lower atmosphere in the WTM than in a CTTM.
For example, in one simulation where we inject 30 keV
electrons into a corona (T = 20 MK, n = 7×1010 [cm−3 ]
3 These times will be even further affected by turbulent scattering in the corona.

9

and L = 2000 ), independent of whether the injected electron distribution is beamed or isotropic, more energy is
deposited at deeper locations in the lower atmosphere
in a WTM than in a CTTM, up to 1000 times more
in the beamed case, at certain locations, and up to 4
times in the isotropic case. Moreover, initially isotropic
non-thermal distributions deposit energy over a greater
range of timescales, and more energy is deposited at
greater times relative to a beamed injection of electrons,
possibly providing a diagnostic of electron anisotropy.
3.4. Solar flare power-law energy inputs
To investigate how the power of flare-accelerated electrons is transferred and deposited in a more realistic solar or stellar flare scenario, we also perform simulation
runs using an injected electron power-law energy distribution of the form F (E0 ) ∼ E0−δ (set (e): different Ec
and set (f): different δ). In these runs, we use the following plasma parameters and injected electron inputs:
T = 20 MK, n = 7 × 1010 cm−3 and the more realistic
atmosphere type 2. Each electron distribution has a total power of P = 4.8 × 1027 erg s−1 , with spectral index
δ = 4 or δ = 7, a low energy cutoff of Ec = 10 keV or
Ec = 20 keV and a high energy cutoff of EH = 50 keV.
Again, such a low high-energy cutoff is used since we
want to examine low-energy electrons that are incorrectly modelled by the CTTM. The results are shown in
Figure 7 and Table 4.
For the power law energy inputs we find the following
notable results:
1. As expected, the differences in CTTM and WTM
power deposition follow the results of Section 3.1
and Section 3.2.
2. For a given injected electron power, we see a larger
difference in CTTM and WTM deposition for electron distributions with a smaller low-energy cutoff
Ec . Spatially, more power is deposited at greater
depths and up to 12 times more power can be deposited in the lower atmosphere for Ec = 10 keV
and 2 times more energy for Ec = 20 keV, at a
given location, for the studied conditions.
3. For a given injected electron power, we see a
larger difference in CTTM and WTM deposition
for electron distributions with softer spectral indices. Spatially more power is deposited at greater
depths and up to 4 times more power can be deposited in the lower atmosphere for δ = 7 and up
to 2 times for δ = 4, at a given location, for the
studied conditions.
4. The simulation runs using 000 .1 binning show that
thermalized low energy electrons deposit a large

fraction of low energy electrons (i.e smaller Ec or
larger δ), that partially or fully thermalize in the
corona, deposit more of their energy at greater
times (second to tens of second timescales).
4. DISCUSSION

In this work, we show that the cold thick-target model
(CTTM) does not adequately approximate the transport and deposition of energetic electrons in flaring, and
therefore strongly heated, solar or stellar atmospheres.
In the CTTM, neglecting second order effects such as
velocity diffusion leads to an underestimate of the energy transferred to the low atmosphere in the majority of cases, especially by lower energy electrons with
E < 50 keV (or equivalently E/kB T ≤ 20) that can fully
or partially thermalize in the flaring corona and transfer

energy diffusively. This leads to a difference in the spatial distribution of deposited non-thermal electron power
in both the corona and cool layers of the low atmosphere.
Understanding energy transfer by low energy electrons
is important. Most solar flare non-thermal electron distributions are consistent with steeply decreasing power
laws with the bulk of the power held by electrons with
E < 50 keV. Further, the thermalization of non-thermal
electrons in the corona leads to the non-thermal electron power being deposited over a large range of times
from sub-second to tens of second, producing delayed
heating in the lower atmosphere. The temporal distribution of this heating profile could act as a diagnostic
of both non-thermal electron properties (even electron
anisotropy, since isotropic electrons will spend longer
in the coronal plasma, leading to greater thermalization), and the plasma conditions in the corona (temperature, number density and the extent of hot coronal
plasma), if it can be extracted from observation. Using a

Energy diffusion and the deposition of energetic electron energy in flares
full WTM description of energy transfer and deposition
may be especially important for the analysis of stellar
flares with higher coronal temperatures and densities.
Also, the WTM description of energy deposition may be
important for the study of microflares with low-energy
≤10 keV accelerated electrons (e.g., Wright et al. 2017)
that can easily thermalize in the coronal plasma, but
still produce heating in the lower atmosphere.
The development of the warm-target model (WTM)
shows the important role coronal plasma properties play
in determining the acceleration, transport and now deposition of flare-accelerated non-thermal electron power.
Future X-ray observatories must aim to better constrain
the plasma properties for this purpose. These simulation
results, although applicable to archived RHESSI data,
anticipate the launch of direct imaging X-ray missions,
that will be able to provide a more detailed picture of
the solar flare environment (temperature, density, ‘hot’
plasma extent) in different regions of the flare, using better spatial and temporal resolution. Proposed missions
such the Focussing Optics X-ray Solar Imager (FOXSI ;
Christe et al. (2017)) will have a high dynamic range
and greater imaging spectroscopy capabilities. The delayed energy transfer by thermalized electrons should be
observable by imaging low energy soft X-rays (< 5 keV).
Current high spectral, spatial and temporal observations
with Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS ; De
Pontieu et al. (2014)) in the transition region and chromosphere can be used to study the effects of delayed
heating by partially or fully thermalized non-thermal
electron distributions.

Jeffrey et al. (2015) show that the flaring corona is
made up of multiple loops of varying temperature and
density. These varying plasma parameters have a huge
effect on both the injected electron parameters and on
the resulting energy deposition. Such variation must
be taken into account in future modelling. Further, we
must study a changing, dynamic atmosphere, since deposition by thermalized non-thermal electrons is modulated by changes in the coronal plasma properties. Importantly, we suggest that hydrodynamic models that
use the CTTM approximation as an input should be reevaluated, and eventually the WTM should replace any
CTTM approximations. WTM energy deposition with
the inclusion of extended loop turbulence and magnetic
trapping will also be the subject of upcoming work. As
stated, the appeal of the CTTM is its simple analytic
form and the next step is to produce a semi-analytic
WTM function that can be used by both the solar and
stellar communities to the determine the deposition of
energy in flaring atmospheres.
