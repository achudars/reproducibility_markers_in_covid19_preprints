ABSTRACT
We report the discovery of a quasar at z = 7.07, which was selected from the deep multi-band imaging data collected
by the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Subaru Strategic Program survey. This quasar, HSC J124353.93 + 010038.5,
has an order of magnitude lower luminosity than do the other known quasars at z > 7. The rest-frame ultraviolet

absolute magnitude is M1450 = −24.13 ± 0.08 mag and the bolometric luminosity is Lbol = (1.4 ± 0.1) × 1046 erg s−1 .
Its spectrum in the optical to near-infrared shows strong emission lines, and shows evidence for a fast gas outflow,
as the C IV line is blueshifted and there is indication of broad absorption lines. The Mg II-based black hole mass is
MBH = (3.3±2.0)×108M⊙ , thus indicating a moderate mass accretion rate with an Eddington ratio λEdd = 0.34±0.20.
It is the first z > 7 quasar with sub-Eddington accretion, besides being the third most distant quasar, known to date.
The luminosity and black hole mass are comparable to, or even lower than, those measured for the majority of low-z
quasars discovered by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and thus this quasar likely represents a z > 7 counterpart to
quasars commonly observed in the low-z universe.

Discovery of the first low-luminosity quasar at z > 7 (SHELLQs VII)
1. INTRODUCTION

Quasars residing in the first billion years of the Universe (z > 5.7) have been used as various types of
probes into early cosmic history. The progress of cosmic reionization can be estimated from H I absorption
imprinted on the rest-frame ultraviolet spectrum of a
high-z quasar; this absorption is very sensitive to the
neutral fraction of the foreground intergalactic medium
(IGM; Gunn & Peterson 1965; Fan et al. 2006a). The
luminosity and mass functions of quasars reflect the
seeding and growth mechanisms of supermassive black
holes (SMBHs), which can be studied through comparison with theoretical models (e.g., Volonteri 2012;
Ferrara et al. 2014; Madau et al. 2014). Measurements
of quasar host galaxies and surrounding environments
tell us about the earliest mass assembly, possibly happening in the highest density peaks of the underlying dark matter distribution (e.g., Goto et al. 2009;
Decarli et al. 2017; Izumi et al. 2018).
Quasars at the highest redshifts are of particular interest, as they have spent only a short time since their formation. The current frontier for high-z quasar searches
is z > 7, where only a few quasars have been found to
date. Since radiation from z > 7 quasars is almost completely absorbed by the IGM at observed wavelengths
λ < 9700 Å, and such objects are very rare and faint,
one needs wide-field deep imaging in near-infrared (IR)
bands or in the y-band with red-sensitive CCDs to discover those quasars. The first z > 7 quasar was discovered by Mortlock et al. (2011) at z = 7.09, from the
United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) Infrared
Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS; Lawrence et al. 2007) data.
The second one was discovered by Bañados et al. (2018)
at z = 7.54, by combining data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (Wright et al. 2010), UKIDSS,
and the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey1 . In addition, two quasars, both at z = 7.02, were recently
discovered (Wang et al. 2018; Yang et al. 2018) by combining datasets from several wide-field surveys, including the Dark Energy Survey (DES Collaboration 2005),
the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument legacy imaging surveys (Dey et al. 2018), and the Panoramic Survey
Telescope & Rapid Response System 1 (Pan-STARRS1;
Chambers et al. 2016).
However, the above z > 7 quasars are all very luminous (if they are not strongly lensed; e.g., Fan et al.
2018; Pacucci & Loeb 2018), due to the detection limits of the imaging survey observations. These quasars
harbor SMBHs with masses of roughly a billion solar

masses, shining at close to the Eddington luminosity
(however the black hole mass of one of the quasars at
z = 7.02 has not been measured; Yang et al. 2018).
They likely represent the most extreme monsters, which
are very rare at all redshifts, especially at z > 7. To
understand a wider picture of the formation and early
evolution of SMBHs, it is crucial to find z > 7 quasars
of more typical luminosity, which would be direct counterparts to low-z ordinary quasars.
This letter presents the discovery of a quasar at z =
7.07, HSC J124353.93 + 010038.5 (hereafter “J1243 +
0100”), which has an order of magnitude lower luminosity than do the other known z > 7 quasars. It harbors a
SMBH with a mass of MBH = (3.3 ± 2.0) × 108 M⊙ and
shining at an Eddington ratio λEdd = 0.34 ± 0.20. We
describe the target selection and spectroscopic observations in §2. The spectral properties of the quasar are
measured and discussed in §3. A summary appears in
§4. We adopt the cosmological parameters H0 = 70 km
s−1 Mpc−1 , ΩM = 0.3, and ΩΛ = 0.7. All magnitudes
refer to point spread function (PSF) magnitudes in the
AB system (Oke & Gunn 1983), and are corrected for
Galactic extinction (Schlegel et al. 1998).
2. OBSERVATIONS

J1243 + 0100 was selected from the Hyper SuprimeCam (HSC) Subaru Strategic Program (SSP) survey
(Aihara et al. 2018a) data, as a part of the “Subaru
High-z Exploration of Low-Luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs)” project (Matsuoka et al. 2016, 2018a,b,c). The
coordinates and brightness are summarized in Table 1.
A three-color composite image around the quasar is presented in Figure 1. This source has a full-width-at-halfmaximum (FWHM) size of 0′′ .7 on the y-band image,
which is consistent with the PSF size estimated at the
corresponding image position. We used the methods detailed in Matsuoka et al. (2018b) to select this source as
a high-z quasar candidate. The probability that this
source was a quasar, not a Galactic brown dwarf, was
PQ = 0.4, based on our Bayesian probabilistic algorithm
(Matsuoka et al. 2016) and the HSC i, z, and y-band
photometry. It is among ∼30 z-band dropout objects
in our quasar candidate list; we have so far conducted
follow-up observations of roughly half of these candidates, and partly reported the results in the SHELLQs
papers mentioned above. The highest-z quasar we found
and published previously is at z ∼ 6.9 (Matsuoka et al.
2018a).
We obtained a red-optical spectrum of the candidate
using the Faint Object Camera and Spectrograph (FOCAS; Kashikawa et al. 2002) mounted on the Subaru
telescope. The observations were carried out on 2018

a Coordinates are at J2000.0. The astrometric accuracy of the
HSC-SSP data is estimated to be 0′′ .1 (Aihara et al. 2018b).

April 24 as a part of a Subaru intensive program (program ID: S16B-011I). We used FOCAS in the multiobject spectrograph mode with the VPH900 grism and
SO58 order-sorting filter. With a slit width of 1′′ .0, this
configuration gave spectral coverage from 0.75 to 1.05
µm and resolution R ∼ 1200. We took 7 × 10-min
exposures with 1′′ dithering between exposures along
the slit, under photometric skys with the seeing around
0′′ .6. The data were reduced with IRAF using the dedicated FOCASRED package in the standard manner.
The wavelength scale was calibrated with reference to
sky emission lines, and the flux calibration was tied to
a white dwarf standard star, Feige 34, observed on the

same night. The slit loss was corrected for by scaling the
spectrum to match the HSC y-band magnitude (Table
1).
A near-IR spectrum of the object was obtained
with the Gemini Near-InfraRed Spectrograph (GNIRS;
Elias et al. 2006) on the Gemini-north telescope. The
observations were carried out on 2018 June 25, July 22
and 29 in the queue mode (program ID: GN-2018AFT-112). We used the cross-dispersed mode with 32
l/mm grating, with the central wavelength set to 1.65
µm. The slit width was 1′′ .0, which gave spectral coverage from 0.85 to 2.5 µm and resolution R ∼ 500. We
took 36 × 5-min exposures in total, with 3′′ dithering
between exposures along the slit, under spectroscopic
skys with the seeing 0′′ .5 – 0′′ .7. The data reduction
was performed with IRAF using the Gemini GNIRS
package, in the standard manner. The wavelength scale
was calibrated with reference to Argon lamp spectra,
and the flux calibration and telluric absorption correction were tied to a standard star, HIP 58510, observed
right before or after the quasar observations at similar
airmass. We scaled the GNIRS spectrum to match the
FOCAS spectrum in the overlapping wavelength range.
In addition, we took a K-band spectrum of the quasar
with the Multi-Object Infrared Camera and Spectrograph (MOIRCS; Ichikawa et al. 2006) on the Subaru telescope. The observations were carried out on
2018 July 8 and 9 (program ID: S18A-061). We used
MOIRCS in the multi-object spectrograph mode with
the VPH-K grism. The slit width was 0′′ .8, which
gave spectral coverage from 1.8 to 2.5 µm and resolution R ∼ 1700. We took 34 × 4-min exposures in
total, with 3′′ dithering between exposures along the
slit, under spectroscopic skys with the seeing 0′′ .5 –
0′′ .8. The data reduction was performed with IRAF
using the MCSMDP package, in the standard manner.
The wavelength scale was calibrated with reference to
sky emission lines, and the flux calibration and telluric
absorption correction were tied to a standard star, HIP
69747, observed right after the quasar observations. We
scaled the MOIRCS spectrum to match the GNIRS
spectrum in the overlapping wavelength range.
Finally, the FOCAS, GNIRS, and MOIRCS data were
merged into a single spectrum, with a wavelength pixel
spacing of λ/∆λ = 1500. The associated errors were
derived from the sky background spectrum measured
for each of the above observations, and were propagated to the final spectrum. Figure 2 presents the
merged spectrum and errors, which are used for the
measurements described in the following section. While
the spectrum may show marginally positive flux in the
Gunn & Peterson (1965) trough bluewards of Lyα, these

Discovery of the first low-luminosity quasar at z > 7 (SHELLQs VII)
are likely due to imperfect sky subtraction, as we see no
signal at <0.98 µm in the 2d spectrum. The Mg II line
appears to have two peaks, but these peaks do not appear consistently among the individual exposures and
are likely due to noise.
3. SPECTRAL MEASUREMENTS

We measured spectral properties of the quasar
through model fitting. The model consists of a powerlaw continuum with a slope αλ = −1.5 (Vanden Berk et al.
2001)2 , Balmer continuum (De Rosa et al. 2011), Fe II
+ Fe III pseudo-continuum (Vestergaard & Wilkes 2001;
Tsuzuki et al. 2006, modified following Kurk et al.
(2007)), and Gaussian profiles to represent the C IV
λ1549, C III] λ1909, and Mg II λ2800 emission lines.
Each emission line was modeled with a single Gaussian,
given the limited S/N of the spectrum. The fitting was
performed in the rest-frame wavelength range from λrest
= 1450 Å to 3000 Å, which contains the three emission
lines listed above3 . All model components were fitted
simultaneously to the data via χ2 minimization, which
provided the best-fit parameter values and associated
errors. The derived best-fit model is presented in Figure
2.
We measured the apparent and absolute magnitudes
of the quasar at λrest = 1450 Å from the best-fit powerlaw continuum. We also measured the continuum luminosity at λrest = 3000 Å from the best-fit model,
and converted to the bolometric luminosity assuming a
bolometric correction factor BC3000 = 5.15 (Shen et al.
2011). The results are listed in Table 1.
Table 2 summarizes the emission line properties derived from the best-fit Gaussian models. The quasar
redshift measured from the Mg II line is z = 7.07 ± 0.01.
We found that the emission lines from the higher ionization species, C IV in particular, are significantly
blueshifted relative to Mg II. We estimated the black
hole mass (MBH ) from the FWHM of Mg II and the continuum luminosity at λrest = 1350 Å, using the calibration presented by Vestergaard & Osmer (2009) 4 . This
2 We also tried fitting with a variable slope and found that this
parameter is poorly constrained (αλ = −2.0 ± 0.8), presumably
due to degeneracy with the other continuum components and the
limited signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the present data.
3 We did not include in the fitting the spectral region around
Si IV λ1400, which is affected by the low atmospheric transmission
and possibly by broad absorption lines (BALs; see below).
4 We could use the continuum luminosity estimated at a wavelength closer to the Mg II line, but given the limited S/N of the
present data, the measurement would be affected by the degeneracy of the three (power-law, Balmer, and iron) continuum components. We checked that the MBH estimate doesn’t change significantly when the continuum luminosity at 2100 or 3000 Å is

5

yielded MBH = (3.3 ± 2.0) × 108 M⊙ , and an Eddington
ratio λEdd = 0.34 ± 0.20. The systematic uncertainty
of the above calibration is estimated to be a factor of a
few, which is not included in the MBH and λEdd errors
presented in this letter.
The Ly α strength relative to the above emission lines
appears weaker than observed in low-z quasars (e.g.,
Vanden Berk et al. 2001). This is likely due to IGM absorption, including damping wing absorption redwards
of Ly α, and/or possible BALs. We defer detailed modeling of these absorptions to a future paper, and here
measured the Ly α + N V λ1240 flux by simply integrating observed flux excess above the continuum model
over λrest = 1215 − 1255 Å; the result is listed in Table
2.
Figure 3 compares the estimated black hole mass and
bolometric luminosity of J1243 + 0100 with those of
other quasars in the literature. While the other known
z > 7 quasars have MBH & 109 M⊙ and radiate at the
rates close to the Eddington limit, J1243 + 0100 has
a considerably lower-mass black hole and is shining at
a sub-Eddington rate. The luminosity and black hole
mass of J1243 + 0100 are comparable to, or even lower
than, those measured for the majority of low-z quasars
in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release
7 (DR7) catalog (Shen et al. 2011). Thus, this quasar
likely represents the first example of an ordinary quasar
beyond z = 7.
On the other hand, given the limited S/N of the spectrum, the present measurements of MBH and λEdd could
be biased; for example, noise spikes can affect measurement of the Mg II line width significantly. We added
artificial errors to the spectrum, based on the observed
noise array, and performed the model fitting for 100
realizations of the generated spectrum. This yielded
MBH = (3.1 ± 1.3) × 108 M⊙ and λEdd = 0.36 ± 0.16
(the median values and intervals containing 68% of the
realizations), while 5 and 2 % of the realizations gave
(MBH < 108 M⊙ , λEdd ≥ 1) and (MBH > 109 M⊙ ,
λEdd < 0.1), respectively. Deeper observations than presented here are clearly needed to better characterize this
quasar.
J1243+0100 has strong emission lines with high equivalent widths, compared to the luminous z > 7 quasars,
which may in part reflect the so-called Baldwin (1977)
effect. We found that the rest-frame equivalent widths
(REWs) of the emission lines listed in Table 2 are comparable to those of low-z counterparts. In particular,
the median REWs of ∼13,000 SDSS DR7 quasars, seused alternatively, with the corresponding calibration factor from
Vestergaard & Osmer (2009).

observed flux relative to the power-law continuum model at ∼1.05 µm and ∼1.17 µm may be due to BALs. The insert shows an

follow-up studies, with deeper spectroscopy in the optical and near-IR. Finally, future observations of this
highest-z ordinary quasar with, e.g., the Atacama Large
Millimeter/ submillimeter Array and the James Webb
Space Telescope will allow us to investigate the gaseous
and stellar properties of the host galaxy, which will be a
key to understand the relationship between the quasar
activity and the host galaxy at an early stage of cosmic
history.

Figure 3. Compilation of black hole mass and bolometric luminosity measurements in quasars. The contours
(linearly spaced in surface density) represent the distribution of quasars in the SDSS DR7 catalog (Shen et al.
2011), while the diamonds represent quasars at 5.7 < z <
7 (Kurk et al. 2007; Jiang et al. 2007; Willott et al. 2010;
De Rosa et al. 2011, 2014; Venemans et al. 2015; Wu et al.
2015; Mazzucchelli et al. 2017; Eilers et al. 2018; Shen et al.
2018). The filled triangle represents J1243+0100, the quasar
presented in this letter, while the unfilled triangles represent other z > 7 quasars reported by Mortlock et al. (2011),
Bañados et al. (2018), and Wang et al. (2018).

lected to have continuum luminosities within ±0.1 dex
of J1243 + 0100, are 49 Å and 36 Å for C IV and Mg II,
respectively. This may indicate that the physical conditions in the broad line regions of quasars are similar
from z > 7 to the relatively nearby universe. In addition, the spectrum of J1243 + 0100 may show signs of
BALs bluewards of the Si IV and C IV emission lines.
While these features are found at wavelengths relatively
free from atmospheric absorption, the limited S/N of the
present data prevents us from robustly confirming them.
This possible BAL signature and the large blueshift of
the C IV emission line may indicate the presence of a
fast gas outflow close to the quasar nucleus.
An important application of a high-z quasar spectrum is to measure the IGM neutral fraction around the
quasar, via the absorption damping wing analysis. One
could also estimate the quasar lifetime from an analysis
of the quasar proximity effect. However, such measurements require accurate modeling of the spectral shape
around Ly α, which is hard to do with the limited S/N
of the present data. The BAL features, if confirmed
to be present, may also complicate such analyses for
J1243 + 0100. But these will be interesting subjects of

This letter is the seventh in a series of publications presenting the results from the SHELLQs project, a search
for low-luminosity quasars at z & 6 based on the deep
multi-band imaging data produced by the HSC-SSP survey. We presented the discovery of J1243 + 0100, a
quasar at z = 7.07. It was selected as a quasar candidate from the HSC data, and its optical to near-IR
spectrum was obtained with FOCAS and MOIRCS on
Subaru, and GNIRS on Gemini. The quasar has an order of magnitude lower luminosity than do other known
quasars at z > 7. The estimated black hole mass is
MBH = (3.3 ± 2.0) × 108 M⊙ , and the Eddington ratio
is λEdd = 0.34 ± 0.20. As such, this quasar may represent the first example of an ordinary quasar beyond
z = 7. The large blueshift of the C IV emission line and
possible BAL features suggest the presence of a fast gas
outflow close to the quasar nucleus.
The discovery of J1243+0100 demonstrates the power
of the HSC-SSP survey to explore SMBHs at z > 7,
with masses typical of lower-z quasars. The quasar was
selected from ∼900 deg2 of the survey (including substantial area with partial survey depths), and we are
in the course of follow-up observations of the remaining
candidates. We expect to find a few more quasars at
z > 7 by the completion of the survey, which is going
to cover 1400 deg2 in the Wide layer. Combined with
luminous z > 7 quasars discovered by other surveys,
and also with lower-z counterparts of ordinary quasars,
those high-z low-luminosity quasars will provide a significant insight into the formation and evolution of SMBHs
across cosmic history.
This work is based on data collected at the Subaru
Telescope and retrieved from the HSC data archive system, which is operated by the Subaru Telescope and
Astronomy Data Center at National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ). The data analysis was in
part carried out on the open use data analysis computer
system at the Astronomy Data Center of NAOJ.
This work is also based on observations obtained at
