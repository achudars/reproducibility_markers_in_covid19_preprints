BIFURCATION FOR MINIMAL SURFACE EQUATION IN
HYPERBOLIC 3-MANIFOLDS
ZHENG HUANG, MARCELLO LUCIA, AND GABRIELLA TARANTELLO

Abstract. Initiated by the work of Uhlenbeck in late 1970s, we study existence, multiplicity and asymptotic behavior for minimal immersions of a closed
surface in some hyperbolic three-manifold, with prescribed conformal structure
on the surface and second fundamental form of the immersion. We prove several results in these directions, by analyzing the Gauss equation governing the
immersion. We determine when existence holds, and obtain unique stable solutions for area minimizing immersions. Furthermore, we find exactly when
other (unstable) solutions exist and study how they blow-up. We prove our
class of unstable solutions exhibit different blow-up behaviors when the surface is of genus two or greater. We establish similar results for the blow-up
behavior of any general family of unstable solutions. This information allows
us to consider similar minimal immersion problems when the total extrinsic
curvature is also prescribed.

0. Introduction: Geometric Settings
Minimal surfaces have long been a fundamental object of intense study in geometry and analysis. In this paper we study minimal immersions of a closed surface
in some hyperbolic three-manifolds. Inspired by Uhlenbeck’s approach ([Uhl83]),
results on existence and multiplicity of such minimal immersions, as well as their
geometrical interpretations, are obtained by analyzing bifurcation properties of solutions to the minimal surface equation. Throughout the paper, we assume S is a
closed oriented surface of genus g ≥ 2. The Teichmüller space of S is denoted by
Tg (S), and it is the space of conformal structures (or equivalently hyperbolic metrics) on S such that two conformal structures are equivalent if there is between them
an orientation-preserving diffeomorphism in the homotopy class of the identity.
When S is immersed in some hyperbolic three-manifold M , we denote by g0
the induced metric from the immersion and by σ ∈ Tg (S) the conformal structure
on S induced by g0 . Furthermore, we denote by gσ the unique hyperbolic metric
on (S, σ), and by dA its area form. Since the metrics gσ and g0 are conformally
equivalent, for a suitable conformal factor u ∈ C ∞ (S), we have
(0.1)

g0 = e2u gσ .

We denote always by z = x + iy the conformal coordinates on (S, σ). So in local
conformal coordinates we may write:
gσ = e2uσ dzdz̄,

and

g0 = e2v dzdz̄,

with v = uσ + u and u given in (0.1). Now, in such coordinates, the second
fundamental form II takes the following quadratic expression:
(0.2)

II = h11 (dx)2 + 2h12 dxdy + h22 (dy)2 ,

with h11 = −h22 accounting for the fact that (S, g0 ) is a minimal surface in M .
The Riemann curvature tensor Rijκ` and the metric tensor g = (gij ) of the
hyperbolic three-manifold (M, g) satisfy the following equations:
(0.3)

Rijκ` = −(giκ gj` − gi` gjκ ).

Note that by Bianchi identities, only six components of Rijκ` are independent.
In this respect, we can use normal coordinates (z, r) for the normal bundle
T N (S), with conformal coordinates z ∈ S and r ∈ (−a, a) for some a > 0 small.
We obtain via the exponential map a local coordinate system on M around S, where
we have gj3 = δj3 , for j = 1, 2, 3. In these coordinates, the remaining components
giκ , 1 ≤ i ≤ κ ≤ 2, are just −Ri3κ3 in view of (0.3), namely,
(0.4)

Ri3κ3 = −giκ .

The equations in (0.4) can be viewed as a second order system of ODEs for gik in
the variable r (and fixed z ∈ S). So we can uniquely identify giκ (around S) by its
initial data:
(
giκ (z, 0) = (g0 )iκ (z)
(0.5)
1 ∂
1 ≤ i ≤ κ ≤ 2.
2 ∂r giκ (z, 0) = hiκ (z),
Such initial data on S are provided by the remaining equations in (0.3). To
verify this, we take ` = 3 and j 6= 3 in (0.3) and get
(0.6)

Rijκ3 = 0,

which expresses the Codazzi equations on S, for 1 ≤ i, j, κ ≤ 2. Again only two
of those equations are independent, and they ensure exactly that the quadratic
differential α = (h11 − ih12 )dz 2 is holomorphic and
(0.7)

II = Re(α),

see [[Hop89, LJ70]]. In other words, α ∈ Q(σ), where we denote by Q(σ) the
space of holomorphic quadratic differentials on (S, σ).
Finally taking i = κ = 1 and j = ` = 2 in (0.3), one gets:
(0.8)

2
R1212 = −g11 g22 + g12
,

which simply gives the Gauss equation on S, and it states that the conformal factor
u(z) in (0.1) on S must satisfy:
(0.9)

|α|2 −2u
e
= 0,
det(gσ )

BIFURCATION FOR MINIMAL SURFACE EQUATION IN HYPERBOLIC 3-MANIFOLDS

with α given in (0.7), and ∆ the Laplacian in the hyperbolic metric gσ . Indeed, (0.9)
simply expresses a consistency condition on (S, gσ ) between the intrinsic curvature
of the metric g0 and the extrinsic curvature detg0 II, see [Uhl83] for details.
Note that, by Bianchi identities, once the equations (0.6), (0.8) hold on S then
they hold throughout the normal bundle of S. Furthermore, these equations on S
provide the initial data (0.5) in terms of (σ, α), simply by using the solutions of the
Codazzi-Gauss equations (0.7), (0.9) into (0.1)-(0.2).
Thus by prescribing σ ∈ Tg (S) and α ∈ Q(σ) such that the Codazzi-Gauss
equations (0.7), (0.9) are solvable, it is natural to ask whether it is possible to
obtain a minimal immersion of (S, σ) into some hyperbolic three-manifold with
the second fundamental form satisfying (0.7). In short, we shall call a minimal
immersion of S with data (σ, α) any of such minimal immersion.
A general construction of a minimal immersion with prescribed data satisfying
the Codazzi-Gauss equations (called “hyperbolic germs” in [Tau04]) is available in
literature, see for instance [Tau04, Jac82]. However, it is not always possible to
guarantee that the corresponding hyperbolic three-manifold is complete, unless we
are more specific about the induced metric g0 or equivalently about the solution of
(0.9). Thus, to obtain more satisfactory results of geometrical nature, Uhlenbeck
analyzed in [Uhl83] more closely the set of solutions of (0.9).
We recall that a solution u of (0.9) is called stable if the linearized operator of
(0.9) at u is nonnegative definite in H 1 (S), and called strictly stable if the linearized
operator of (0.9) at u is positive definite in H 1 (S). The interest to stable solutions
is justified by the fact that they give rise to (local) area minimizing immersions.
By setting:

the length squared of α with respect to the hyperbolic metric gσ , Uhlenbeck ([Uhl83])
considered a one-parameter family of Gauss equations:
(0.10)

∆u + 1 − e2u − t2 kαk2σ e−2u = 0,

for minimal immersions of S with data (σ, tα). Using the implicit function theorem, she proved the existence and uniqueness of a smooth solution curve of stable
solutions to the equation (0.10):
Theorem 0.1. ([Uhl83]) Fixing a conformal structure σ ∈ Tg (S), and α ∈ Q(σ),
there exists a constant τ0 > 0, depending only on (σ, α), such that the equation
(0.10) admits a unique stable solution if and only if t ∈ [0, τ0 ]. Furthermore for
each t ∈ [0, τ0 ], the stable solution ut < 0 of (0.10) forms a smooth monotone
decreasing curve with respect to t. Moreover, ut is strictly stable for t ∈ [0, τ0 ) and
ut % ut=0 = 0, as t & 0, in H 1 (S).
From Theorem 0.1, a bifurcation diagram (especially for the lower branch, in
absolute value, of the solution curve) can be sketched as below in Figure 1:

Figure 1. Uhlenbeck’s Solution Curve

In this diagram, Uhlenbeck indicated a first turn of the curve of stable solutions
at some τ0 , though it is still possible the curve retracts and passes again the value
t = τ0 to join other solutions of (0.10) for t ≥ τ0 . Actually it is our first task here
to show that this is never the case.
From the geometrical point of view, by Theorem 0.1 we know that, for t ∈ [0, τ0 ],
there exists an area minimizing (stable) immersion of S with data (σ, tα) whose
induced metric on the surface (S, σ) is g0 = e2ut gσ . The second variation of the
area functional is explicitly computed in terms of the linearized operator in [Uhl83].
Also it is interesting to note that there exists a τ1 > 0, such that for each t ∈ (0, τ1 ),
the surface can be minimally immersed into a so-called almost Fuchsian manifold
and this almost Fuchsian manifold contains (S, σ) as its unique minimal surface.
In particular, as t → 0+ such family of almost Fuchsian hyperbolic three-manifolds
converge (in the sense of Gromov-Hausdorff) to a Fuchsian manifold where S is
embedded as a totally geodesic area minimizing surface, see [Uhl83] for details.
Further work in [HL12] obtained an additional solution for each of Uhlenbeck’s
(strictly) stable solution to the Gauss equation:
Theorem 0.2. ([HL12]) Let S be a closed surface and σ ∈ Tg (S) be a conformal
structure on S. If α ∈ Q(σ) is a holomorphic quadratic differential on (S, σ), then:
i) for sufficiently large t, the Gauss equation (0.10) admits no solutions, i.e.,
there is no minimal immersion of S with data (σ, tα) into any hyperbolic threemanifold;
ii) for each t ∈ (0, τ0 ), with τ0 > 0 given in Theorem 0.1, there exists also an
unstable immersion of S with data (σ, tα).

These results reveal further details on the solution curve to (0.10) and an improved bifurcation diagram can be sketched as follows:

1. Introduction: Main results
The first purpose of this paper is to complete the above results in Theorems 0.1
and 0.2 as follows. Firstly, we already mentioned, we show that actually the interval
[0, τ0 ] exhausts the full range of values t ≥ 0 for which the equation (0.10) is solvable.
Namely, the bifurcation curve starting from the trivial solution at t = 0, cannot
admit an “S-shape” (as typical in similar problems), but it turns only at τ0 and
until then, furnishes the lower branch (in absolute value) of unique (strictly) stable
solutions of (0.10). In fact, equation (0.10) admits a unique (stable but not strictly
stable) solution for t = τ0 and no solutions for t > τ0 . Furthermore we provide
a family of unstable solutions for (0.10) with a specific asymptotic behavior, as
t → 0+ . A sketch of the bifurcation diagram can be seen as below in Figure 3.

Theorem A. Fixing a conformal structure σ ∈ Tg (S), and a holomorphic quadratic
differential α ∈ Q(σ), the equation (0.10) admits a solution if and only if t ∈
[0, τ0 ], with τ0 = τ0 (σ, α) > 0 given in Theorem 0.1. Furthermore, the unique
stable solution ut < 0 is the (pointwise) largest solutions of (0.10) for t ∈ [0, τ0 ].
Moreover,
(i) ∀t ∈ (0, τ0 ), the equation (0.10) admits an unstable solution ũt (with ũt <
ut < 0 on S) such that, as t & 0,
max |ũt | → +∞,
S

inf

t∈(0,τ0 )

ut (z), ∀z ∈ S

We may say that (τ0 , uτ0 ) is a “bending point” for the bifurcation curve starting
at (t = 0, u = 0), using the terminology introduced in [AR73]. Actually we provide
a much more detailed study of the asymptotic behavior of the unstable solution ũt
in Theorem A, as t & 0. Interestingly, its behavior depends on whether the surface
(S, σ) can be “uniformized” within the class of hyperbolic metrics with conical
singularities along a divisor of modulus 2.
To be more precise, recall that a divisor D on S is a “formal” expression of the
type
(1.1)

D=

m
X

αj pj ,

j=1

with given points pj ∈ S and values αj > −1, j = 1, · · · , m; and
|D| =

m
X

αj

j=1

is the modulus of the divisor. Therefore a hyperbolic metric on S with conical
singularities along the divisor D in (1.1) is a metric with Gauss curvature −1
in S\{p1 , · · · , pm } and a conical singularity at pj with angle θj = 2π(1 + αj ) for
j = 1, · · · , m. Thus, the “uniformization” of (S, σ) in the class of hyperbolic metrics
with conical singularities along the divisor D, just means that at least one of such
metric is conformal to gσ . Consequently, the corresponding conformal factor u is
given by the unique solution of the following equation:
(1.2)

− ∆u = 1 − e2u − 2π

m
X

αj δpj .

j=1

By analyzing (1.2), one easily see that the “uniformization” of S in the sense above
is possible if and only if
χ(S) + |D| < 0,

where χ(S) = 2(1−g) is the Euler characteristic of S. In particular, if |D| = 2, then
necessarily the genus g ≥ 3. Thus our blow-up analysis must distinguish between
the cases where S has genus two or higher.

We start with the following:
Theorem B. Let the genus of the surface S satisfy g ≥ 3, and ũt be the unstable
solution given by Theorem A. Then as t & 0, we have:
(1.3)

t2 kαk2σ e−2ũt * 4πδp0

weakly in the sense of measures, with some point p0 ∈ S such that α(p0 ) 6= 0.
Furthermore:
2,β
ũt → ũ in W 1,q (S), 1 < q < 2, uniformly in Cloc
(S\{p0 }), 0 < β < 1,

and
e2ũt → e2ũ

in Ls (S), ∀s ≥ 1,

with ũ the unique solution of the following problem on S.:
(1.4)

∆ũ + 1 − e2ũ − 4πδp0 = 0.

From the geometrical point of view, Theorem B states that, ∀t ∈ (0, τ0 ) there
exist (unstable) minimal immersions of S with data (σ, tα) which converge (in the
sense of Gromov-Hausdorff) as t → 0+ to a “limiting” totally geodesic immersion
of S into a three-dimensional hyperbolic cone-manifold of the type introduced by
Krasnov-Schlenker [KS07]. More precisely, the given hyperbolic three-manifold
contains conical singularities along one line to infinity and the induced metric on
S is hyperbolic with a conical singularity along the divisor D = 2p0 , with suitable
p0 ∈ S and α(p0 ) 6= 0. Therefore for our unstable immersions, we observe a quite
different limiting behavior from the case of area minimizing (stable) immersions.
If S has genus g = 2, then the asymptotic behavior of ũt is described by a
“concentration-compactness” alternative, resolved by the existence (or not) of a
minimum for a Moser-Trudinger type functional. To be more precise, let us recall
the following:
´
Definition 1.1. Let E = {w ∈ H 1 (S) with S w(z)dA = 0}, the Moser-Trudinger
functional on (S, σ) with weight function 0 ≤ K ∈ L∞ (S) is given by
ˆ

(1.5)

S
where we have used the standard notation:
f dA =

|S|

and the area |S| = 4π(g − 1) by the Gauss-Bonnet theorem.
By the Moser-Trudinger inequality (see [Aub98]), the functional J is bounded
from below but not coercive in E. In other words, it is well defined
(1.6)

inf J > −∞,
E

but the infimum in (1.6) may not be attained.
For the case of genus g = 2, our main result reads:

8

Theorem C. If the surface S is of genus g = 2, and ũt is the unstable solution

Furthermore, for K(z) = kαk2σ , we have the following alternatives:

(i) (Compactness) either, the Moser-Trudinger functional J (with K = kαk2σ )

and uniformly in Cloc
(S\{p0 }), 0 < β < 1, with G(·, p) the unique Green’s
function of the Laplace operator ∆ on the hyperbolic surface (S, gσ ), as defined
in (3.1) below.

Hence, from Theorem C we see that, in contrast to higher genera, when g = 2
the (unstable) minimal immersion of S does not survive the passage to the limit,
as t → 0+ . Indeed for the induced metric g̃t0 = e2ũt gσ , there holds:
|S|g̃t0 → 0, as t → 0+ .

Nonetheless, when the functional J in (1.5) with K = kαk2σ attains its minimum in
E, then we can still find, as t → 0+ , a “limiting” configuration for the “blown-up”
surface (S, ĝt0 ) with
ĝt0 = e2ût gσ , and ût = ũt − log t.

Indeed, along a sequence t = tn → 0+ , the blown-up sequence (S, ĝt0n ) converges
(in the sense of Gromov-Hausdorff) to a surface (S, ĝ 0 ) conformally equivalent to
(S, gσ ) with same total negative curvature −4π. It is interesting to note that (S, ĝ 0 )
admits a non-positive curvature vanishing exactly as |α|.
More generally, for any sequence of unstable solutions un of (0.10) with t = tn →
0+ , as n → +∞, we shall carry out an analogous blow-up analysis whose details are

BIFURCATION FOR MINIMAL SURFACE EQUATION IN HYPERBOLIC 3-MANIFOLDS

contained in Theorem D of Section §3. Roughly speaking, to any such sequence,
we shall associate a divisor D in S of the following type:
m
X
(1.10)
D=2
(1 + n(pj ))δpj
j=1

with suitable pj ∈ S and n(pj ) = 0 if α(pj ) 6= 0, while for pj a zero of α (i.e.
α(pj ) = 0), then n(pj ) is given by the corresponding multiplicity. Furthermore,
(1.11)

χ(S) + |D| ≤ 0.

In case χ(S) + |D| < 0, then as before, we find that the sequence of corresponding
minimal immersions of S with data (σ, tn α) converges (in the sense of GromovHausdorff) to a “limiting” totally geodesic immersion into a three-dimensional hyperbolic cone-manifold which induces on S a hyperbolic metric with conical singularities along the divisor D in (1.10). While in case χ(S) + |D| = 0, then no
such singular metric exist on S and exactly as above, the given (unstable) minimal
immersions do not survive the passage to the limit. Thus, as before, the asymptotic
behavior of the blow-up sequence un is described by a “concentration-compactness”
alternative, see Theorem D in section §3 for details.
It is an interesting open problem to see whether unstable solutions of (0.10) can
be constructed in such a way that their blow-up behavior matches a prescribed
divisor of the type (1.10) and (1.11).
In conclusion, let us make a few remarks.
Remark 1.2. It is well known that any α ∈ Q(σ) admits 4(g − 1) zeroes, counting multiplicity. Seen from Theorems B and C, we have that the blow-up of the
unstable solution ũt , as t → 0, cannot occur around a zero of α. A more precise
characterization of the blow-up point p0 in Theorems B and C will be given in the
sections §4 and §5.
Remark 1.3. It is interesting to record that for g = 2, the behavior of the unstable
solution ũt , as t → 0+ depends on whether the Moser-Trudinger functional J in
(1.5) with weight K = kαk2σ attains in its infimum in E. Actually, exactly when
K(z) = kαk2σ , the existence of extrema for J appears to be a delicate open problem.
Indeed we shall see in section §5.2 that in such case the functional J just misses to
satisfy the condition provided (for a general weight function K) in Theorem 7.2 of
[DJLW97]] which is sufficient to ensure the existence of a global minimum for J .
Remark 1.4. From the blow-up analysis in Theorem D where Theorems B and C
enter as special cases, we shall obtain a compactness result for solutions of (0.10).
This will enable us to obtain a minimal immersion of S with prescribed total ex´
trinsic curvature, ρ = S detg0 (II)dA(g0 ) ∈ (0, 4π(g − 1)) and data (σ, tρ α), with
suitable tρ ∈ (0, τ0 ). It would be interesting to investigate the dependence of tρ with
respect to ρ.
Remark 1.5. (Added to the proof ) The statement of Theorem A and parts of its
proof are somewhat similar to a result of Ding-Liu ([DL95]) where they analyzed
a problem of prescribing Gaussian curvature on closed surfaces. In fact from the

10

ZHENG HUANG, MARCELLO LUCIA, AND GABRIELLA TARANTELLO

variational point of view, both problems (with a parameter) admit similar structures.
More precisely, we have the presence of a (strict) local minimum and a “mountain
pass geometry”, for a suitable sharp range of the parameter involved. Typically, in
this situation one can claim the existence of a stable and unstable solution (as in
Theorem A and in [DL95]) with the stable solution “bifurcating” out of a known
(trivial) solution of the problem at a limiting value of the parameter. Much more
interesting is the description of the asymptotic behavior of the unstable solution,
which reflects the particular nature of the geometrical problem in hands. This is
the purpose of our Theorems B, C and D. For the Gauss curvature problem treated
in [DL95], this goal has been pursued in [BGS15], and more recently by Struwe
in [Str20], who obtained complete results. In fact, Struwe’s result encourages the
possibility to also complete our blow-up analysis in Theorem D when blow-up occurs
at a zero of the quadratic differential α, see Remark 6.3 and 6.4 below. We thank
the referee for pointing out these references.
Plan of the rest of the paper: In §2, we will provide several estimates before
we move to prove Theorem A in section §4. Detailed blow-up analysis is conducted
in sections §3 where we obtain Theorem D, and in §5, where we prove Theorems B
and C. In §6, we extend the program to explore this minimal immersion problem
when prescribing the total extrinsic curvature.

2. Elementary estimates
Before we proceed, we introduce more convenient notations. We set
v = −2u
and

|α|2

det(gσ )
and rewrite the Gauss equation (0.10) as follows:
K(z) = kαk2σ =

(2.1)

− ∆v = 2t2 Kev − 2(1 − e−v ),

where v ∈ H 1 (S), t ≥ 0, and K(z) ≥ 0 has finitely many zeroes, given by the zeroes
of the prescribed holomorphic quadratic differential α ∈ Q(σ), whose total number
is 4g − 4, counting multiplicity.
Definition 2.1. We call a function vt ∈ H 1 (S) a solution of problem (1)t for t ≥ 0,
if it solves the equation (2.1).
We collect some basic properties for the solutions of this problem.

Proof. These properties follow by direct and elementary calculations. More specifically, to obtain (2.2), we integrate (2.1) and apply the Gauss-Bonnet formula. At
this point (2.3) is a direct consequence of (2.2) and Schwarz inequality.
In order to show (ii), we simply write v = v + − v − where v + and v − are both
non-negative. Using v − as a test function we have

for any p ≥ 1. Standard regularity results for elliptic equations imply that v is in
fact smooth. Then the conclusion follows from the strong maximum principle.
Finally (iii) follows by using v = w + c in (2.2) and by solving with respect to c.

Proof. Inequality (2.6) easily follows from (2.2) and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
as seen in [HL12].
In particular, this lemma implies that, for t > t∗ , there does not exist any
minimal immersion of S with data (σ, tα).
Lemma 2.4. Let v = w + c be a solution to problem (1)t , where w and c are as in
Lemma 2.2. We have

Proof. Since the righthand side of (2.1) is uniformly bounded in L1 -norm because
of (2.2), independent of t, then (2.7) follows from Stampacchia elliptic estimates.
In particular, for any p ≥ 1, there exists a constant Cp > 0 such that kwkp ≤ Cp .

3. Blow-up Analysis
In this section we will study in details the general asymptotic behavior of a
blow-up sequence of solution for problem (1)t . As an application, we will prove
Theorems B and C in sections §5 and §6.

Here δp is the Dirac measure with pole at the point p ∈ S. It is well-known (see for
instance [Aub98]) that
G(p, q) = G(q, p), for p 6= q,
and

3.1. Mean field formulation. Our blow-up analysis about solutions of problem
(1)t is based on well-known results concerning blow-up solutions of Liouville type
equations in mean field form (see [BM91, LS94, BT02]). Thus, we proceed first
to reformulate problem (1)t to a mean field type equation. To this end, we let v be
a solution of problem (1)t and set:
ˆ

By the conservation identity (2.2), we know that ρ ∈ (0, 4π(g − 1)). As before (in

Lemma 2.2), we set v = w + c, where S w(z)dA = 0, and c = S v(z)dA.
Lemma 3.1. If v = w + c is a solution of the problem (1)t satisfying (3.3) with
ρ ∈ (0, 4π(g − 1)), then w satisfies:

α(z) = 0 ⇐⇒ z = qi for some i ∈ {1, · · · , N },
and let ni be the multipilcity of qi . It is well known that,

(b) (Concentration) or, for suitable points {p1 , · · · , ps } ⊂ S (blow-up points),
we have sequences {pi,n } ⊂ S: pi,n → pi such that:

´
Proof. As in the statement, we write vn = wn + cn , where S wn (z)dA = 0, and
ffl
cn = S vn (z)dA. By Lemma 2.4, we can always assume that, along a subsequence,
wn * w0 weakly in W 1,q (S), 1 < q < 2.
Let

Therefore, we know that the righthand side of (3.14) is uniformly bounded in

C 2,β (S)-norm, with β ∈ (0, 1). So, along a subsequence, we can assume that,

At this point, we recall the following well-known “concentration-compactness” result of [BM91, LS94, BT02] which we state in a form suitable for our situation:
Theorem 3.2. ([BM91, LS94, BT02]) Assume (3.17) with ρn ∈ (0, 4π(g − 1))

and (3.18) with K(z) = det(g

and the following alternative holds:

zn → z0

strongly in H 1 (S),

pj,n → pj , such that zn (pj,n ) → +∞ as n → +∞, such that,

Proof. See Theorem 5.7.65 in [Tar08].
Back to the proof of Theorem D. We apply Theorem 3.2 to zn in (3.16), and
along a subsequence, we have:
zn * z0 weakly in W 1,q (S), 1 < q < 2.
Recall that by assumption: max vn → ∞, and so in case alternative (1) in TheoS

rem 3.2 holds, in view of (3.15) and (3.16), we see that necessarily
cn → +∞, and wn → w0 strongly , as n → ∞.
Therefore, by dominated convergence, we derive:
ˆ
(3.22)
4π(g − 1) − ρn =
e−vn dA → 0, as n → ∞.
S

So ρn → 4π(g − 1), and by (3.13) we deduce that (3.6) must hold with m = g − 1
in this case.
This covers the compactness part in the statement (ii). Furthermore, by part
(iii) of Lemma 2.4, we see also that tn → 0, as n → ∞, and so (3.5) holds.
Next we assume that alternative (2) in Theorem 3.2 holds. Then by virtue of
s
P
(3.13), (3.20), and (3.21), we check that (3.6) holds with m :=
(1 + n(pj )). We
j=1

consider first the case where 1 ≤ m < g − 1. As a consequence,
ˆ
e−vn → 4π(g − 1 − m) > 0,
S
ffl
and so necessarily cn = S vn must be uniformly bounded. Thus along a subsequence, we have: vn * v0 weakly in W 1,q (S), 1 < q < 2, and also uniformly in
C 2,β (S\{p1 , · · · , ps }) with 0 < β < 1, for some v0 . Furthermore, by dominated
convergence, we see that
e−vn → e−v0 in Lp (S), ∀ p ≥ 1.
As a consequence v0 satisfies (3.10). In other words, we have verified that part (i)
holds in this case.
Since,
vn → v0 , and t2n Kevn → 0, as n → ∞,

uniformly on compact sets of S\{p1 , · · · , ps }, we may conclude that (3.5) must hold
as well.
Finally, when we have alternative (2) with m = g − 1, then necessarily
ˆ
e−vn → 0, as n → ∞.
S

As a consequence, cn → +∞, as n → ∞ and this implies as above, that tn → 0,
by part (c) of Lemma 2.4. Thus we have verified (3.5), (3.11), and (3.6) with

18

ZHENG HUANG, MARCELLO LUCIA, AND GABRIELLA TARANTELLO

m = g − 1. At this point, alternative (2) of Theorem 3.2 in this situation gives
exactly the (concentration) part (b) of (ii).
Finally, since w0 in (3.11) satisfies:

s

w = 0,
S 0
we see that (3.12) holds, and the proof is complete.
Concerning the location of the (possible) blow-up points {p1 , · · · , ps } of vn , we
can use well-known results ([OS05]) which apply to the blow-up points of the
sequence zn in (3.17). Thus, according to Theorem 2.2 of ([OS05]), we conclude
that, if pj is a blow-up point with α(pj ) 6= 0, then in conformal coordinates around
pj there holds:



j6=i

with i ∈ {1, · · · , s}, and
h = Keζ0 ,

(3.25)

with ζ0 in (3.15) and K = kαk2σ .
Notice in particular that when m = g − 1, then the function ζ0 ≡ 0, and (3.24)
provides a well-known necessary condition for blow-up at {p1 , · · · , ps }. Indeed,
in case of non-degeneracy, (3.24) turns out to be also a sufficient condition for
the construction of blow-up solutions at {p1 , · · · , ps } for mean field equations on
surfaces, see for instance [CL03].
On the contrary, when 1 ≤ m < g − 1, the condition (3.24) is more involved since
the function ζ0 is nonzero and satisfies the following equation:
(3.26)



s

So ζ0 itself depends on the blow-up points {p1 , · · · , ps }. Therefore it would be
interesting to see whether one can find a (nondegenerate) set of points satisfying
(3.24), (3.25) and (3.26) which turns out to be the blow-up set of a sequence of
bubbling solutions for (1)t , along a sequence of t’s going to zero.
As a consequence of Theorem D, we know that blow-up can only occur as t → 0.
Therefore, we can complete the (uniform) estimates given in Lemma 2.4 as follows:
Corollary 3.3. For any δ > 0, there exists a constant Cδ > 0 such that any
solution v of the problem (1)t with t ≥ δ satisfies:
kvk∞ ≤ Cδ .

BIFURCATION FOR MINIMAL SURFACE EQUATION IN HYPERBOLIC 3-MANIFOLDS 19

Actually, by means of elliptic estimates we know that the L∞ (S)−norm above
can be replaced by any other stronger norm. Theorem D can be better interpreted
in terms of the mean field formulation of problem (1)t , and gives the following
“compactness” result:
Corollary 3.4. Let wn be a sequence of solutions for (3.4) with ρ = ρn , and
ρn → ρ0 ∈ (0, 4π(g − 1)]\{4πm, 1 ≤ m ≤ g − 1}. Then along a subsequence,
wn → w0 in H 1 (S) (and any other relevant norm), with w0 a solution of (3.4)
with ρ = ρ0 .
Corollary 3.5. For every compact set A ⊂ (0, 4π(g − 1)]\{4πm, 1 ≤ m ≤ g − 1},
the set of solutions of (3.4) with ρ ∈ A is uniformly bounded in C 2,β (S), 0 < β < 1.
4. Proof of theorem A
In this section, we will prove parts of Theorem A, in various steps. In this way,
we obtain a detailed description of the lower branch of the bifurcation solution
curve C. We shall take advantage of the variational formulation of problem (1)t .
Indeed, it is easy to verify that (weak) solutions of problem (1)t correspond to the
critical points of the following functional:

4.1. First bending point. We define the following two sets:
(4.2)

Λ = {t ≥ 0 : (1)t admits a solution },

and
(4.3)

Λs = {t ≥ 0 : (1)t admits a stable solution }.

Clearly Λs ⊆ Λ ⊂ [0, t∗ ], with t∗ given in (2.6). Furthermore, since the problem
(1)t=0 only admits the trivial solution v = 0, which is strictly stable, we see that,
Λs is nonempty and,
(4.4)

0 < τ0 = sup{Λs } ≤ t0 = sup{Λ}.

We aim to show that Λ = Λs and t0 = τ0 .
To this purpose, we observe firstly that, by the estimates in Corollary 3.3 and a
limiting argument, we know that problem (1)τ0 admits a stable solution v0 which is
also degenerate. According to the language of Crandell and Rabinowitz ([CR80]),
(v0 , τ0 ) defines a “bending point” for the curve of solutions of problem (1)t , given
by the zero set of the map
F (v, t) = ∆v + 2 − 2(e−v + t2 Kev ) : C 2,β (S) × R → C 0,β (S),
with 0 < β < 1.
To establish Theorem 0.1, Uhlenbeck ([Uhl83]) showed that actually τ0 is the
only value for which the problem (1)t admits a degenerate stable solution.

20

ZHENG HUANG, MARCELLO LUCIA, AND GABRIELLA TARANTELLO

Proposition 4.1. The problem (1)t admits a degenerate stable solution only at
t = τ0 . Moreover, for any t ∈ [0, τ0 ] problem (1)t admits a unique stable solution
which forms a smooth monotone increasing curve (with respect to t), and it is
strictly stable for t ∈ [0, τ0 ).
Proof. Let v0 be the degenerate stable solution for (1)τ0 . We know that (v0 , τ0 )
must correspond to a “bending point” for the set: F (v, t) = 0, around (v0 , τ0 ) (see
[CR80]).In other words, for  > 0 small, there exists a smooth curve (v(s), t(s))
satisfying F (v(s), t(s)) = 0 for all s ∈ (−, ), such that: v(0) = v0 , t(0) = τ0 ,
ṫ(0) = 0, and v̇ > 0 (i.e. v(s) is increasing), where we have used the “dot” to
denote derivatives with respect to s.
Uhlenbeck showed further that ẗ(0) < 0 (see [Uhl83]), so that:
t(s) < t0 , ∀ s ∈ (−, )\{0},
and in particular, ṫ(s) > 0 for s ∈ (−, 0). This implies that v(s) is strictly stable
for every s ∈ (−, 0).
Note that the same local description would hold for any other (possible) degenerate stable solution for which the corresponding of (4.3) would hold. This shows
that if we continue the lower branch (v(s), t(s)), s ∈ (−, 0) with the Implicit Function Theorem, we see that it cannot join with another degenerate stable solution
at lower value of t. Instead, the lower branch can be continued until it joins the
trivial solution at t = 0. Thus, we can conclude that there exists a smooth, increasing curve of strictly stable solutions of problem (1)t , t ∈ [0, τ0 ), which joins
the trivial solution v = 0 at t = 0 with the degenerate stable solution v0 at t = τ0 .
This also shows that for any t ∈ [0, τ0 ], problem (1)t cannot admit any other stable
solution. As otherwise we could argue as before to join such a different solution to
the trivial solution along another smooth curve of solutions, a contradiction to the
non-denegeracy of the trivial solution v ≡ 0 at t = 0. This concludes the proof.
Proposition 4.1 shows in particular that Λs = [0, τ0 ] and it also furnishes a proof
to Theorem 0.1.
In the next subsection, we shall prove, with the help of the sub/super solution
method in variational guise (see [Str00]), that problem (1)t admits a stable solution
for any t ∈ [0, t0 ] where t0 = sup{Λ}. Consequently Λ = Λs = [0.τ0 ].
4.2. Stable solutions. We now prove the following theorem on stable solutions:
Theorem 4.2. Let t0 = sup Λ (Λ in (4.2)). For any t ∈ [0, t0 ], problem (1)t
admits a stable solution v1,t which is strictly increasing with respect to t, and
coincides with the smallest of the solutions (and supersolutions) of Problem (1)t .
Furthermore, for t = t0 ,
v1,t0 (z) = sup v1,t (z) < +∞
0≤t<t0

is the unique solution for problem (1)t0 . In particular: t0 = τ0 and Λs = Λ = [0, τ0 ].
Proof. Since for t = 0, v ≡ 0 is the desired stable solution, we let t ∈ (0, t0 ) be
fixed. By (4.4), we can find some t1 ∈ Λ such that, 0 < t < t1 . We denote by v1 > 0

Z = {v ∈ H 1 (S) : 0 ≤ v ≤ v1 a.e. in S}.

(4.5)

It is routine to verify that Z is a non-empty, convex and closed subset of H 1 (S). In
addition, the functional It is bounded from below and coercive on Z. Consequently
the functional It attains its minimum value at a point v1,t in Z, i.e.,
It (v1,t ) = min It ,

(4.6)

Z

and 0 ≤ v1,t ≤ v1 on S.

By the strict sub/super solution property of v0 ≡ 0 and v1 respectively, we have
It (v1,t ) < min{It (0), It (v1 )},
and therefore v1,t 6≡ v1 and vt 6≡ 0. Following [Str00], we show next that v1,t is
a critical point for It , therefore a solution to (1)t . We first let φ ∈ C ∞ (S) with
φ ≥ 0, and for  > 0 sufficiently small, we define
v = v1,t + φ − φ + φ ,

(4.7)
where

φ = max{0, v1,t + φ − v1 } ≥ 0,

and

φ = max{0, −(v1,t + φ)} ≥ 0.

Therefore we have v ∈ Z. By virtue of (4.6) and (4.7), we have:

Similar calculations show that
hIt0 (v1,t ), φ i = o(),

as  → 0.

Applying (4.8), we find:
hIt0 (v1,t ), φi ≥ 0.

We obtain the reverse inequality by replacing φ with −φ. Since C ∞ (S) is dense in
H 1 (S), by a density argument we have now proved:
hIt0 (v1,t ), φi = 0, ∀φ ∈ H 1 (S).
This implies that v1,t is a solution to problem (1)t . Note that v1,t 6≡ 0 and v1,t 6≡ v1 ,
so by the maximum principle, we have:
0 < v1,t (z) < v1 (z), ∀z ∈ S.

(4.9)

This ensures that v1,t is a local minimum for the functional It in C 1 (S)-norm.
We are going to show that v1,t is actually a local minimum for It in H 1 (S)norm, and hence a stable solution for problem (1)t . To this purpose, we argue by
contradiction. Suppose there exists vn ∈ H 1 (S) such that It (vn ) < It (v1,t ), and
vn → v1,t in H 1 (S). Letting

we may assume, without loss of generality, that

{It (v) : k∇(v − v1,t )k22 + kv − v1,t k22 = δn2 }.

This enables us to apply the Lagrange multiplier method, and for suitable λn ∈ R,
we find that vn satisfies
(4.10)

− ∆vn = 2t2 K(z)evn + 2e−vn − 2 + λn (−∆(vn − v1,t ) + 2(vn − v1,t ))

We set
ηn = p

(4.11)

vn − v1,t

k∇(v1,t − vn )k22 + 2kv1,t − vn k22

Then we see that kηn kH 1 ≤ 1. So along a subsequence, ηn converges weakly in
H 1 (S) to some function η ∈ H 1 (S), as n → +∞. Moreover, for any p ≥ 1 we also
have
kηn − ηkp → 0.

(4.12)
By recalling that

It (vn ) − It (v1,t )

Since vn → v1,t in H 1 (S), we know that, for any p ≥ 1,

So by (4.17) and (4.20), we can use elliptic regularity theory to conclude that
vn ∈ C 1 (S). Furthermore, the righthand side of (4.17) converges to zero in Lp (S),
for p > 1, as n → +∞. Consequently, by (4.20), we can use again elliptic estimates
to show that (vn − v1,t ) → 0 in C 1 -norm. This is a contradiction to the fact that
v1,t is a local minimizer for the functional It in C 1 -norm. Therefore v1,t ∈ H 1 (S)

24

ZHENG HUANG, MARCELLO LUCIA, AND GABRIELLA TARANTELLO

is a local minimum of It and hence a stable solution for the problem (1)t with
t ∈ (0, t0 ).
So far we have shown that ∀t ∈ [0, t0 ), problem (1)t admits a stable solution v1,t
(and infinitely many supersolutions). As a consequence,
t0 = τ0 = sup Λs ,
and by Proposition 4.1 we know also that problem (1)τ0 admits a unique stable
(degenerate) solution v0 .
For t ∈ (0, τ0 ), to show that v1,t is the smallest among all solutions (and supersolutions) of problem (1)t , we define for z ∈ S,
(4.21)

vt (z) = inf{v(z) : v a solution or supersolution of problem (1)t } ≥ 0.

Clearly, vt (z) defines a supersolution of problem (1)t , in the sense that the following

S

for any φ ∈ H 1 (S) with φ ≥ 0. Since t > 0, we have vt 6≡ 0. Moreover, (4.22) can
never hold with a strict sign, as otherwise we would be in position to apply the
sub/super solution method as above, and obtain a solution of problem (1)t which
is smaller than vt , in contradiction with (4.21). Hence vt is a solution of problem
(1)t which, by definition, is the smallest solution of (1)t and strictly increasing with
respect to t ∈ [0, τ0 ).
We claim:
vt = v1,t .

(4.23)

To establish this claim, it suffices to show that vt is stable, so that (4.23) follows
by the uniqueness of stable solutions in Proposition 4.1.
To this purpose, for t ∈ (0, τ0 ), we use vt as a supersolution to problem (1)s ,
for 0 < s < t. As above, for s ∈ (0, t), we obtain a stable solution v̄s of problem
(1)s satisfying 0 < v̄s < vt in S. By taking a sequence sn % t, then by dominated
convergence and elliptic estimates, we see that v̄sn → v̄ in H 1 (S), with v̄ a stable
solution of problem (1)t and 0 < v̄ ≤ vt . Since vt is the smallest solution to (1)t ,
we conclude that v̄ ≡ vt , and so vt is stable and (4.23) is established.
From (4.23), it also follows that, ∀t ∈ [0, τ0 ), v1,t < v0 , with v0 the unique stable
solution of problem (1)τ0 . So by the monotonicity property of v1,t in t, we find:
lim v1,t (z) = sup {v1,t (z)} = v0 (z), as t % τ0 ,

t%τ0

0≤t<τ0

where again by dominated convergence and elliptic estimates, the convergence actually occurs uniformly in C 2,β (S), 0 < β < 1. Clearly, v0 must define the smallest
solution of problem (1)τ0 , i.e., v0 = v1,τ0 . In fact we show that actually v0 is the
only solution of problem (1)τ0 .
To this purpose we argue by contradiction and assume there is another solution
v 0 for the problem (1)τ0 . By construction, v0 is the smallest solution at t = τ0 ,
so necessarily v 0 > v0 on S. As seen in Proposition 4.1, around (v0 , τ0 ), we find a
solution curve (v(s), t(s)) such that for s ∈ (0, ) and  > 0 sufficiently small, we

BIFURCATION FOR MINIMAL SURFACE EQUATION IN HYPERBOLIC 3-MANIFOLDS 25

obtain a solution v(s) for the problem (1)t(s) such that t(s) < τ0 and v0 < v(s) < v 0 .
Thus for t ∈ (t(s), τ0 ) we find v(s) as subsolution and v 0 as supersolution for problem
(1)t . So we can use the sub/super solution method again, and for t ∈ (t(s), τ0 ),
we obtain a stable solution for the problem (1)t which will be greater than v0 ,
and therefore greater than the smallest solution v1,t . This is impossible, since the
smallest solution is also the only (strictly) stable solution of problem (1)t .
4.3. Compactness for the functional It . We will complete the proof of Theorem A in this subsection, namely we will prove the existence of an additional
solution for each t ∈ (0, t0 ). This will extend a multiplicity result in ([HL12]).
By combining Proposition 4.1 and Theorem 4.2, we have now established that,
∀ t ∈ (0, τ0 ), v1,t is a strict local minimum for It (v) in H 1 (S). Furthermore, one
checks that, for every t ∈ (0, τ0 ):
It (v1,t + C) → −∞,
as C → +∞. In other words, for t ∈ (0, τ0 ), the functional It admits a “mountainpass” structure ([AR73]). Next we establish the following Palais-Smale (compactness) condition:
Theorem 4.3. Suppose a sequence {vn } ∈ H 1 (S) satisfies that, It (vn ) → c and
It0 (vn ) → 0 as n → ∞, then {vn } admits a convergent subsequence. In particular,
c is a critical value for the functional It .
Proof. We show first that vn is uniformly bounded in H 1 -norm. As in Lemma 2.2,
´
ffl
we write vn = wn + cn , with S wn (z)dA = 0, and cn = S vn (z)dA. Then, we have

By assumption, hIt0 (vn ), 1i = o(1) as n → ∞. Applying Jensen’s inequality, we
have, as n → ∞:
e−cn ≤ e−cn

S

e−wn dA ≤ 1 + o(1).

Therefore for some suitable constant C0 > 0, we find cn ≥ −C0 . Now from (4.1)
and (4.24), we obtain, as n → ∞:
ˆ
1
(4.25) I(vn ) = k∇wn k22 + 4e−cn
e−wn dA − 8π(g − 1) + 8π(g − 1)cn + o(1).
2
S
By assumption, I(vn ) is uniformly bounded, so from (4.25) we also see that cn is
bounded from above, and that k∇wn k2 is uniformly bounded.
In conclusion we have kvn kH 1 ≤ C for some suitable C > 0. Therefore along a
subsequence, vn converges to some v ∈ H 1 (S) weakly. The convergence is strong
ffl
in Lp (S) for p ≥ 1. In particular we have cn → S vdA and I 0 (v) = 0. By the
Moser-Trudinger inequality, we also have:
ke|vn | kLp ≤ Cp , ∀p ≥ 1.
In particular, for p = 2, and as n → ∞,

In other words, we have

We can now apply the mountain pass construction of Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz
([AR73]) to obtain a second (unstable) mountain pass solution v2,t > v1,t for all
t ∈ (0, t0 ), satisfying:
(4.26)

It (v2,t ) = inf max It (Γ(s)) > It (v1,t ),
Γ∈Pt s∈[0,1]

with the path space
(4.27)
Pt = {Γ : [0, 1] → H 1 (S) is continuous with Γ(0) = v1,t , It (Γ(1)) ≤ It (v1,t ) − 10}.
Clearly Pt is not empty, since for A > 0 sufficiently large we easily check that
Γ(s) = v1,t + sA, s ∈ [0, 1] lies in Pt .
Finally we show that the unstable solution v2,t will not stay bounded as t → 0:
Proposition 4.4. For t ∈ (0, τ0 ), let v2,t be the mountain pass solution obtained
above. Then:
(4.28)

max v2,t → +∞, as t → 0.
S

Proof. We argue by contradiction. Suppose that, along a sequence tn → 0, we have
0 ≤ v2,tn ≤ C,
for suitable constant C > 0. Then by elliptic estimates (along a subsequence), we
find that {v2,tn } converges strongly in C 2,β (S) norm to v ≡ 0, the unique solution
of problem (1)t=0 . But this is impossible, since for t > 0 small, the stable solution
v1,t is the only solution of (1)t contained in a small ball centered at the origin .
Clearly, by a similar argument, we see that any family of unstable solutions of
(0.10) admits the same blow-up behavior in (4.28), as t → 0+ .
5. Blow-up analysis: applications to mountain pass solutions
In this section, we apply the general blow-up analysis of §3 to the mountain pass
solution v2,t of problem (1)t obtained in Theorem A. The asymptotic behavior of
v2,t differs when the surface has genus two or higher.
By Proposition 4.4 and Theorem D, we know that:

Moreover, v0 is the unique solution to the following equation on S:
−∆v0 = 8πδp0 + 2e−v0 − 2.
In order to establish Theorem 5.1, we establish first the following estimates:
Lemma 5.2. If the genus g ≥ 3, then for a suitable constant C > 0, we have:

t2
with a suitable constant C > 0 (independent of t).
To this purpose we use sharp estimates obtained in [DJLW97] in order to establish the existence of minimizers for the Moser-Trudinger functional J in (1.5).
We fix p ∈ S with K(p) 6= 0. As in [DJLW97], we use normal (polar) coordinates
at p, centered at the origin, so that for r = dist(q, p), we have:
(5.5)

It (v2,t ) ≤ 8π log

8πG(r, θ) = −4 log r + A(p) + b1 r cos θ + b2 r sin θ + β(r, θ), as r → 0,
with A(p) = 8πγ(p, p), suitable constants b1 and b2 depending on the hyperbolic
metric gσ , and β(r, θ) = o(r) as r → 0. Recall that G(p, q) is the Green’s function
in (3.2), and γ(p, q) its regular part.

By the improved Moser-Trudinger inequality of Chen-Li [CL91] (see Lemma 6.2.7

for a suitable constant Cr > 0. In other words, p0 is the unique blow-up point for

wtn (pn ) = max wtn → +∞, as n → ∞
S

then:
pn → p0 , as n → +∞.

(5.20)
We shall show that,

K(p0 ) 6= 0,

(5.21)

and since K = kαk2σ , p0 cannot be a zero for α ∈ Q(σ).
In order to see this, we use (5.3) and (5.10) to find that,
ˆ

Thus, as t & 0, we have:

with suitable positive constants C1 and C2 .
Thus, we obtain:

z∈Br (p0 )

with a suitable constant C > 0, independent of r > 0. So by letting r & 0, we get
that K(p0 ) > 0 and (5.21) is proved.
At this point, for any sequence tn & 0, we can apply Theorem D for the sequence
v2,tn . In view of (5.18) and (5.19), we know that v2,tn can admit exactly one blowup point at p0 with K(p0 ) 6= 0. Therefore (3.6) must hold with m = 1 < g − 1, and
consequently properties (i)-(iii) must hold for v2,tn .
Since this holds along any sequence tn & 0, we obtain the desired conclusion.
5.2. Blow-up analysis when g = 2. When the surface is of genus g = 2, the
asymptotic behavior of v2,t is governed by the extremal properties of the MoserTrudinger functional J in (1.5) (see for instance [Tru67, Mos71, Aub82]). Indeed, the goal of this subsection is to prove the following:
Theorem 5.3. Let S be of genus g = 2. Then, as t & 0, we have:

(5.26)

then the following alternative holds:

we have:

(5.33)

p∈S

and in particular, α(p0 ) 6= 0.
Remark 5.4. Clearly, if we knew the uniqueness of the minimum of the MoserTrudinger functional J on E (when attained), or of the maximum point of the
function 4πγ(p, p) + log K(p), we could claim the convergence above as t → 0, not
only along a subsequence t = tn → 0 as n → ∞.
Concerning the existence of a global minimum of J in E, we briefly recall the
work of Ding-Jost-Li-Wang ([DJLW97]) and Nolasco-Tarantello ([NT98]):
Lemma 5.5. We have:
(5.34)

inf J (w) ≤ −8π(max{4πγ(p, p) + log(K(p)} + log(2π(g − 1)) + 1),

w∈E

p∈S

and the infimum is attained if (5.34) holds with a strict inequality.
Proof. See [DJLW97, NT98].
On the basis of Lemma 5.5, the existence of a global minimum for the extremal
problem:
ˆ
1
(5.35)
inf {
|∇w|2 dA − 8π log( K(z)ew dA)},
w∈E 2 S

was ensured by the authors in [DJLW97, NT98] under the following sufficient
condition:


8π
(5.36)
∆gσ log K(p0 ) > −
− 2κ(p0 )
|S|σ
with p0 satisfying (5.33), and κ the Gauss curvature of (S, σ). See also [Tar08].
|α|2
For our geometrical problem, we have K = det(g
, with gσ the hyperbolic metric,
σ)
and α ∈ Q(σ) a holomorphic quadratic differential on the Riemann surface (S, σ).

BIFURCATION FOR MINIMAL SURFACE EQUATION IN HYPERBOLIC 3-MANIFOLDS 33

So for any p0 ∈ S with α(p0 ) 6= 0, we have κ(p0 ) = −1, |S|σ = 4π (note that g = 2),
and
∆gσ log K(p0 ) = −4.
Therefore we see that both sides of (5.35) are equal to −4, and in this sense we just
“missed” to satisfy this sufficient condition (5.36).

Proof. We first apply (2.2) to the solution v2,t which (for g = 2) implies that (3.6)
must hold with m = g − 1 = 1. Therefore we have, as t & 0,
ˆ
ˆ
t2
Kev2,t → 4π, and
e−v2,t → 0.
S

S

As before, we write v2,t = wt + ct , and (by Jensen’s inequality) we find:
ct → +∞ as t & 0.
This establishes (5.23) and (5.24). Notice that we are now in the situation described
by part (ii) of Theorem D.
In order to establish (5.25), we use (5.23) and g = 2, to conclude that the mean
value ct of v2,t must satisfy (2.4) with the “plus” sign. In other words,

Since (5.48) holds for every w ∈ E, and using (5.40), we establish (5.25). Actually,

Next we wish to show that wt satisfies the “compactness” alternative in part (ii) of

To this purpose, we fix w ∈ E, and as before set tw > 0 sufficiently small to
ensure that,

for A ∈ [0, 4π 2 ]. Clearly this is a monotone increasing function of A in [0, 4π 2 ].
From (5.47) and (5.38), it follows that, for ∀w ∈ E, and ∀t ∈ (0, tw ), there holds:
(5.51)

k∇wt k22 − 8π log Kewt + f (At (wt )) ≤ k∇wk22 − 8π log Kew + f (At (w)).

Therefore if we assume the functional J attains its infimum at w0 , that is,

then we can use w = w0 in (5.51) to conclude that,
f (At (wt )) ≤ f (At (w0 )), ∀ t ∈ (0, tw0 ).

with S e−wt ≥ 1, by Jensen’s inequality.
Therefore, for suitable C1 > 0, we have,
(5.54)
S

Kewt ≤ C1 , ∀ t ∈ (0, tw0 ).

Using v2,t = wt + ct in Lemma 2.4, we find that,
(5.55)
S

Kewt ≥ C2 ,

for suitable C2 > 0, and moreover wt is uniformly bounded in W 1,q (S), 1 < q < 2.
Now from (5.37), (5.54) and (5.55), we can deduce that:
1
≤ t2 ect ≤ C3 , ∀ t ∈ (0, tw0 ),
C3

(5.57)

with a suitable constant C4 > 0.
So in case the functional J attains its infimum in E, then we can use the estimates in (5.56) and (5.57) together with elliptic estimates and well known regularity
theory, to conclude that, wt is uniformly bounded in C 2,β (S)-norm, with 0 < β < 1,
for any t ∈ (0, tw0 ). Consequently, along a subsequence tn & 0, wn := wtn satisfies
the “compactness” property of part (ii) in Theorem D. In other words, (5.27) holds
with w0 satisfying (5.28) and (5.29).
Next suppose the functional J does not attain its infimum in E. Therefore, wt
can not satisfy the “compactness” property in part (ii) in Theorem D. Consequently,
by (5.23) we know that, along a sequence tn & 0, the sequence wn := wtn must
admit one (m = 1) blow-up point p0 ∈ S, satisfying (5.30), (5.31), and (5.32). So
we are left to show that (5.33) holds. To this purpose, from (5.49), we know that
wn defines a minimizing sequence for J in E and max wn → +∞, i.e., blow-up
S

occurs. Therefore, we can use for wn , the estimates detailed in [DJLW97] and
[NT98] for any blow-up minimizing sequences of J , to show that,

6. Prescribing extrinsic curvature
In this section, we wish to investigate the possibility to obtain a minimal immersion of S into a hyperbolic three-manifold with prescribed total extrinsic curvature.
Namely, for given ρ ∈ (0, 4π(g − 1)), we require that for the induced metric g0 we
have:
ˆ
(6.1)
ρ = (detg0 Π)dAg0 .
S

6.1. Main result and three lemmata. Our main result is the following:
Theorem E. Fixing a conformal structure σ ∈ Tg (S), and a holomorphic quadratic
differential α ∈ Q(σ), and ρ ∈ (0, 4π(g − 1))\{4πm, m = 2, · · · , g − 2}, there exists
a constant tρ ∈ (0, τ0 ] (τ0 = τ0 (σ, α) > 0 given in Theorem 0.1), such that S admits
a minimal immersion of data (σ, tρ α) into some hyperbolic three-manifold, with
corresponding total extrinsic curvature satisfying (6.1).
In order to establish this result, we need to provide a solution vρ for the problem
(1)tρ , for some tρ ∈ (0, τ0 ] satisfying:
ˆ
|α|2
(6.2)
t2ρ
K(z)evρ dA = ρ, K = kαk2σ =

det(gσ )
S
To this purpose, we recall from §3.1 the Mean Field formulation of the problem
(1)t , as described in Lemma 3.1. Then for given ρ ∈ (0, 4π(g − 1)) we need to find
a solution w of the equation (3.4), that is:

We call this equation, (namely (3.4)), the problem (3)ρ .
To this end, we start with the following observation:
Lemma 6.1. If w solves the problem (3)ρ with ρ ∈ (0, 4π(g − 1)), then:

and vρ > 0, then, ∀ z ∈ S:
|e−vρ (z) −

S

e−vρ dA| < 1 − e−vρ (z) < 1,

and this establishes (6.3).
As a consequence of Corollary 3.5, we know that, for any ρ ∈ (4π(m − 1), 4πm),
m = {1, · · · , g − 1}, the Leray-Schauder degree of the Fredholm operator associated
to the problem (3)ρ is well-defined, and its value only depends on m. To be more
precise, we recall that the Laplace-Beltrami operator ∆ = ∆gσ is invertible on the
space E. We denote by:
(∆|E )−1 : E → E
its (smooth) inverse. Thus each solution to the problem (3)ρ corresponds to a zero
of the following operator:
Fρ (w) = w + Tρ0 (w) + Bρ (w),

(6.6)

∀ w ∈ E,

with
Tρ0 (w) = 2ρ(∆|E )−1

Therefore, in view of Lemma 6.1, there exists a suitable constant C > 0 (independent of ρ), such that if w ∈ E is a solution of problem (3)ρ , that is Fρ (w) = 0, then
kBρ (wk ≤ C.
As a consequence, for any ρ ∈ (4π(m − 1), 4πm), with m = {1, · · · , g − 1}, we
find a radius Rρ sufficiently large, such that, for each t ∈ [0, 1] it is well-defined at
zero the Leray-Schauder degree dρ,t of the operator
(6.9)

Fρt (w) = w + Tρ0 (w) + tBρ (w),

in the ball BRρ = {w ∈ E : kwk ≤ Rρ }. Moreover, by the homotopy invariance of
the Leray-Schauder degree, we have
dρ = dρ,t , ∀ t ∈ [0, 1].
In particular,
(6.10)

dρ = dρ,0 ,

where dρ,0 is the Leray-Schauder degree of the operator
Fρ0 (w) = w + Tρ0 (w),

∀ w ∈ E,

Actually for every ρ 6∈ 4πN, the Leray-Schauder degree of the operator Fρ0 has
been computed by Chen-Lin ([CL03, CL15]), exactly when the weight function K

BIFURCATION FOR MINIMAL SURFACE EQUATION IN HYPERBOLIC 3-MANIFOLDS 39

admits isolated zeros (which is our case) {q1 , · · · , qN }, each with integer multiplicity
ν(qj ), 1 ≤ j ≤ N . More precisely we have the following:
Lemma 6.2. ([CL15]) If ν(qj ) ∈ N ∀1 ≤ j ≤ N , and the genus of the surface is
greater than zero, then dρ,0 > 0.
Proof. See Corollary 1.2 in [CL15].
6.2. Proof of Theorem E. We now complete the proof of Theorem E:
Proof. Since in our case, the weight function K(z) = kαk2σ with α ∈ Q(σ) a holomorphic quadratic differential on S, we know that α admits isolated zeroes of
integer multiplicity and total number (counting multiplicity) equal to 4(g − 1).
Thus, we can apply Lemma 6.2 together with (6.10) to conclude that, for every
ρ ∈ (0, 4π(g − 1))\{4πm, m = 1, · · · , g − 2}, the Leray-Schauder degree dρ > 0. In
other words, for such range of ρ’s, we know that the problem (3)ρ admits at least
one solution. To complete the proof, we need to show that, when g ≥ 3, then we
have the existence of a solution for problem (3)ρ also when ρ = 4π.
To this purpose, we once again exploit the work of Chen-Lin in [CL10, CL02].
We take a sequence wn of the solutions to problem (3)ρn , with 4πm 6= ρn → 4πm,
for some m ∈ {1, · · · , g − 2}. We assume that, as n → +∞, the following holds:
(6.11)

weakly in W 1,q (S), 1 < q < 2,

wn * w0

and
max wn → +∞,

(6.12)

S

Indeed, in case wn was uniformly bounded in S, then by elliptic estimates (along a
subsequence) it would converge to a solution to problem (3)ρ=4πm , and for m = 1
we would obtain our solution in this way. Thus, we assume (6.12) and we want to
establish a sign for the quantity ρn − 4πm. This delicate task has been carried out
by Chen-Lin in [CL10, CL02] for the sequence zn = wn − ζn , satisfying (3.17) and
(3.18), with ζn defined in (3.14) and satisfying (along a subsequence):
(6.13)

ζn → ζ0 ,

on S,

From (6.12) we know that, max zn → +∞. Therefore, by using Theorem 3.2, zn

must admit a finite number of blow-up points, say {p1 , · · · , ps } ⊂ S, for which

If we further assume that these blow-up points are not zeroes of the weight
function K = kαk2σ , that is α(pj ) 6= 0, ∀j = 1, · · · , s; then n(pj ) = 0 and m = s.

In this situation, Chen-Lin in [CL15] were able to control the exact decay to zero
of the quantity: ρn − 4πm. In particular they showed that, the sign of ρn − 4πm is
the same of the following quantity:

where dj ’s are suitable (positive) constants, h∗ = Keζ0 , and κ is the Gauss curvature
of S. Take into account also that the expression (6.15) was given in [CL15] by
formulae (2.3) and (2.10), written under the normalization |S| = 1. Now, for
p ∈ S : α(p) 6= 0, by means of (6.14), we compute:
∆ log(Keζ0 )(p) +

∀ m = {1, · · · , g − 2}.

Therefore, we may conclude that, if K (and hence α) does not vanish at the blow-up
points of wn , then for n sufficiently large, we have: ρn − 4πm < 0. That is, blow-up
can only occur from the “right”.
Since for m = 1, the solutions to problem (3)ρn with ρn → 4π can admit only
one blow-up point p0 ∈ S which must satisfy K(p0 ) 6= 0. Therefore, we can use
the information above, to see that for ρn > 4π and ρn & 4π, the corresponding
solution wn cannot blow-up, and so (along a subsequence) it converges to the desired
solution of (3)ρ=4π .
We conclude the section with two remarks.
Remark 6.3. When the sequence of solutions wn to problem (3)ρn with ρn → 4πm,
blows up at a zero of K = kαk2σ , we suspect that similar information about the sign
of the quantity ρn − 4πm should hold. This is confirmed by the more involved
analysis developed in [CL10], where the authors provide sharp estimates about the
behavior of the sequence zn of (3.18), (3.17), which blows up at a zero of the weight
function K, but only when such a zero is of non-integer multiplicity.
Remark 6.4. Finally we note that, in view of (3.7), (3.8), by choosing α ∈ Q(σ)
with zeroes of multiplicity greater than g − 2, we can always guarantee that blow-up
never occurs at its zeroes.
