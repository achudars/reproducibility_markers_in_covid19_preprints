Abstract. We prove that the automorphism group of the semigeneric directed graph (in the
sense of Cherlin’s classiﬁcation) is uniquely ergodic.

1. Introduction
One key notion in the study of dynamical properties of Polish groups is amenability. A
topological group is amenable when every ﬂow, i.e. continuous action on a compact space,
admits a Borel probability measure that is invariant under the action of the group.
In recent years, the study of non-locally compact Polish groups has exhibited several reﬁnements of this phenomenon. One of them is extreme amenability: a topological group is
extremely amenable when every ﬂow admits a ﬁxed point (see [KPT05]). Another one is unique
ergodicity: a topological group is uniquely ergodic if every minimal ﬂow, i.e. a ﬂow where every
orbit is dense, admits a unique Borel probability measure that is invariant under the action of
the group. In this paper, all measures will be Borel probability measures.
Of course, extreme amenability implies unique ergodicity, but the converse is not true as for
instance, every compact group is uniquely ergodic. Beyond compactness, though, no example is
known in the locally compact Polish case and Weiss proves in [Wei12] that there is no uniquely
ergodic discrete group. In fact, it is suggested on page 5 in [AKL12] that in the setting of
locally compact groups, compactness is the only way to achieve unique ergodicity. However,
some examples appear in the non-locally compact Polish case. The ﬁrst of these examples
was S∞ , the group of all permutations of N equipped with the pointwise convergence topology
(this was done by Glasner and Weiss in [GW02]). Angel, Kechris and Lyons then showed,
using probabilistic combinatorial methods, that several groups of the form Aut(F), where F
is a particular kind of countable structure called Fraïssé limit, are also uniquely ergodic (see
[AKL12]).
A Fraïssé limit is a countable ﬁrst-order homogeneous structure in the sense of model theory
whose age, i.e. the set of its ﬁnite substructures up to isomorphism, is a Fraïssé class. A class F
of ﬁnite structures is a Fraïssé class if it contains structures of arbitrarily large (ﬁnite) cardinality
and satisﬁes the following:
(HP) If A ∈ F and B is a substructure of A, then B ∈ F.
(JEP) If A, B ∈ F then there exists C ∈ F such that A and B can be embedded in C.
(AP) If A, B, C ∈ F and f : A → B, g : A → C are embeddings, then there exists D ∈ F and
h : B → D, l : C → D embeddings such that h ◦ f = l ◦ g.
Examples of Fraïssé classes include the class of ﬁnite graphs, the class of ﬁnite graphs omitting
a ﬁxed clique, the class of ﬁnite r-uniform hypergraphs for any r ∈ N. The unique ergodicity of
the automorphism groups of the limits of those classes was proven in [AKL12].

The Fraïssé limit of a Fraïssé class is unique up to isomorphism. By deﬁnition, Fraïssé limits
are homogeneous, i.e. any isomorphism between two ﬁnite parts of the structure can be extended
in an automorphism of the structure. For more details on Fraïssé classes see [Hod93].
In [PSar], using methods from [AKL12], Pawliuk and Sokić extended the catalogue of uniquely
ergodic automorphism groups with the automorphism groups of homogeneous directed graphs,
which were all classiﬁed by Cherlin (see [Che98]), leaving as an open question only the case of
the semigeneric directed graph.
This graph, which we denote S, is the Fraïssé limit of the class S of simple, loopless, directed,
ﬁnite graphs that verify the following conditions:
i) the relation ⊥, deﬁned by x ⊥ y iﬀ ¬(x → y ∨ y → x), is an equivalence relation,
ii) for any x1 6= x2 , y1 6= y2 such that x1 ⊥ x2 and y1 ⊥ y2 , the number of (directed) edges
from {x1 , x2 } to {y1 , y2 } is even,
where → denotes the directed edge. We will refer to ⊥-equivalence classes as columns and to
the second condition as the parity condition. The ⊥-class of an element a ∈ S will be referred
to as a⊥ .

More details on this structure will be given in the next section.
In this paper, we prove:
Theorem 1. The topological group Aut(S) is uniquely ergodic.
The method we use is diﬀerent from the one found in [AKL12] and [PSar] since we do not work
with the so-called "quantitative expansion property", but rather show that an ergodic measure
can only take certain values on a generating part of the Borel sets. It is also diﬀerent from the
approach in [Tsa14] (see Theorem 7.4) which only applies when the structure eliminates imaginaries. Our method relies on the idea that if there are equivalence classes in a structure and
the universal minimal ﬂow is essentially the convex orderings regarding the equivalence classes,
then the ordering inside the equivalence classes and the ordering of the equivalence classes are
independent, provided that the automorphism group behaves well enough.

2. Preliminaries
The starting point of our proof is common with that of [AKL12]: to prove that Aut(S) is
uniquely ergodic, it suﬃces to show that one particular action is uniquely ergodic, namely, its
universal minimal ﬂow, Aut(S) y M (Aut(S)). This is the unique minimal Aut(S)-ﬂow that
maps onto any minimal Aut(S)-ﬂow (such a ﬂow exists for any Hausdorﬀ topological group by
a classical result of Ellis, see [Ell69]); an explicit description was made by Jasiński, Laﬂamme,

Nguyen Van Thé and Woodrow in [JLNW14]. It is the space of expansions of S whose Age is a
certain class S ∗ .
Before describing this class, we give some more background on S. Observe that the parity
condition is equivalent to the fact for every A ∈ S and two columns P, Q in A ∈ S, we have for
all x, x′ ∈ P ,
(∀y ∈ Q ((x → y) ⇔ (x′ → y))) or (∀y ∈ Q ((x → y) ⇔ (y → x′ ))) .
This remark allows us to deﬁne the equivalence relation ∼Q on P as:
x ∼Q x′ ⇔ ∀y ∈ Q (x → y ⇔ x′ → y).
Note that as a consequence of the parity condition, we get that in S,
∀y ∈ Q (x → y ⇔ x′ → y) ⇔ ∃y ∈ Q (x → y and x′ → y).
We can now consider P 0 and P 1 the two ∼Q equivalence classes in P , and we have P =
P ⊔ P 1 . Note that each of these class could be empty. Similarly, we have Q = Q0 ⊔ Q1 , where
Q0 and Q1 are ∼P -equivalence classes. Note that at that stage, this labelling of these classes
is arbitrary, which is crucial to the construction and understanding of S ∗ bellow. Indeed, the
language of S ∗ has a binary relation R which interpretation is mainly to give a proper labelling
of those equivalence classes.
This description has an interesting consequence when we recall that there must be an edge
between any two points of P and Q. Denote P i → Qj to mean for all x ∈ P i and y ∈ Qj ,
we have x → y. Then P i → Qj , implies that Qj → P 1−i , P 1−i → Q1−j and Q1−j → P i . In
particular, this means that for each i ∈ {0, 1}, there is a unique j ∈ {0, 1} such that P i → Qj .

The class S ∗ is the class of ﬁnite structures in the language L = (→, <, R), verifying :
∗
(A) S|→
= S,
(B) < is interpreted as a linear ordering convex with respect to the columns, i.e. the columns
are intervals for the ordering. For two columns P, Q, we will therefore write P < Q to
mean that for all x ∈ P, y ∈ Q we have x < y.

(a) For all x and y ⊥ y , R (x, y) ⇔ RA (x, y ′ ).

(b) For P, Q any two columns of A with P < Q, there is a unique ∼Q -equivalence
class u (possibly empty) in P such that
∀x ∈ P, y ∈ Q

∗

RA (x, y) ⇔ x ∈ u.

(c) For P, Q any two columns of A∗ with P < Q, if there is x1 ∈ P such that for all
∗
y ∈ Q, RA (x1 , y), then
∀y ∈ Q, x ∈ P

∗

RA (y, x) ⇔ y → x1 .

And if there is no such x1 then we have
∀y ∈ Q, x ∈ P
∗

∗

¬RA (y, x).

∗

(d) If x ⊥A y, we have ¬RA (x, y).
∗
Observe that in a structure A∗ ∈ S ∗ , RA gives us a proper labelling of the ∼Q -equivalence
classes in P when P < Q. In particular, we can render the arbitrary decomposition P = P 0 ⊔P 1 ,
Q = Q0 ⊔ Q1 canonical by setting
∗

x ∈ P 1 ⇔ (∀y ∈ Q RA (x, y))
and

∗

y ∈ Q1 ⇔ (∀x ∈ P RA (y, x)).
A remarkable property of this decomposition is that the edge relation is actually entirely
deﬁned by it. Indeed, take two columns P, Q in A∗ that we decompose as above in P = P 0 ⊔ P 1 ,
Q = Q0 ⊔ Q1 . We know, by construction of R on Q, that Q1 → P 1 . As we observed before, this
means that P 1 → Q0 , P 0 → Q1 and Q0 → P 0 .
Another point of view on this expansion is given in [JLNW14]. Take A ∈ S with n columns
P1 , . . . , Pn and an expansion A∗ ∈ S ∗ . The expansion A∗ is interdeﬁnable with a structure A∗∗
in the language {→, <, Li,f } where Li,f is a unary predicate for all i ∈ {1, . . . , n} = [n] and
∗
A∗
f ∈ 2[n]\i . We have A∗|→,< = A∗∗

Denote M ⊂ {0, 1}S × {0, 1}S the space of expansions of S whose Age is exactly S ∗ . We
will denote E = (<E , RE ) the elements of M, by identiﬁcation with the structure that can be
inferred from the expansion. The result shown in [JLNW14] is:
Theorem A. The universal minimal flow of Aut(S) is Aut(S) y M.
We are interested in showing that the Aut(S)-invariant measures on M are all equal. A useful
tool of measure theory is the following Lemma (see [Gut05] Theorem 3.5)
Lemma 2. Let µ and ν be two probability measures defined on a σ-field E. If there is a
family (An )n∈N ∈ E N stable under intersection that generates E and such that for all n ∈ N,
µ(An ) = ν(An ), then µ = ν.
The rest of this section is devoted to describing a family P of clopen sets that generate the
Borel sets of M. The sets of our family P are of the form

The rest of R on those columns can be recovered from this by construction of S ∗ . Indeed,

An important remark is that if we have a diﬀerent family (x′1 , . . . , x′n ) such that xi ⊥ x′i , then
there is a family (αji )1≤i<j≤n such that
U(xi )n

i=1

,(αji )1≤i<j≤n .

This can be achieved by taking αji = εji if xi ∼x⊥
x′i and αji = 1 − εji otherwise.

An additional remark that will be useful throughout the paper is that for a given family
(x1 , . . . , xn ) of elements taken in diﬀerent columns,

where (aji ⊥ aji′ ) iﬀ j = j ′ .
This collection of sets is a generating family for the open sets of our space, so it is also a
generating family for the Borel sets.
To use Lemma 2, we would also need to know that this family is stable under intersection,
unfortunately this is not the case. However, the intersection of two sets in P is actually a disjoint
union of sets in P. Therefore if we consider P ′ the collection of ﬁnite intersection of elements
of P, the evaluation of a measure on an element of P ′ is determined by the evaluation of the
measure on P. By Lemma 2, any measure is entirely characterized by its evaluation on elements
of P ′ , so it is characterized by its evaluation on elements of P.
3. Invariant measures
From this point on, we denote G = Aut(S). Let us ﬁrst deﬁne µ0 a G-invariant probability
measure on M. We deﬁne µ0 by:

We call µ0 the uniform measure. It is proven in [PSar] that this measure is well-deﬁned on
all Borel sets and that it is G-invariant. We want to show that it is actually the only invariant measure. By Lemma 2, we only have to check that the invariant measures coincide on
U(xi )n ,(εj )1≤i<j≤n ∩ V(a11 ,...,a1i ),...,(ak1 ,...,aki ) .

For proofs of Proposition 4 and Theorem 1, we will need an ergodic decomposition theorem,
thus we need to deﬁne the notion of ergodicity.
Definition. Let Γ be a Polish group acting continuously on a compact space X. A Γ-invariant
measure ν is said to be Γ-ergodic if for all A measurable such that
∀g ∈ Γ ν(A△g · A) = 0,
we have ν(A) ∈ {0, 1}.
We can now state the following (see [Phe01] Proposition 12.4):
Theorem B. Let Γ be a Polish group acting continuously on a compact space X. Let P (X)
denote the space of probability measures on X and PΓ (X) = {µ ∈ P (X) : Γ · µ = µ}. Then,
the extreme points of PΓ (X) are the Γ-ergodic invariant measures.
We will also need to use Neumann’s Lemma (see [Cam99], Theorem 6.2) :
Theorem C. Let H be a group acting on Ω with no finite orbit. Let Γ and ∆ be finite subsets
of Ω, then there is h ∈ H such that h · Γ ∩ ∆ = ∅.
The remaining of the section will be divided in three subsection. One for the proof of Proposition 3, one for the proof of Proposition 4 and ﬁnally one for the proof of Theorem 1.
3.1. Proof of Proposition 3. For this proof, we will need the following technical lemma.
Lemma 5. Let k < n, let P1 , . . . , Pn be different columns in S and let y1 ∈ P1 , . . . , yk ∈ Pk .
Take a given family εji ∈ {0, 1} where 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n and k < j. Then there exist yk+1 ∈
Pk+1 , . . . , yn ∈ Pn such that (yi → yj ) iff εji = 1 for all i < j and k < j.
Proof. Take xk+1 ∈ Pk+1 , . . . , xn ∈ Pn . Consider the following structure
A
A
A = ((y1A , . . . , ynA , xA
k+1 , . . . , xn ), → )

where (yiA →A yjA ) ⇔ (yi → yj ) if i < j ≤ k, (yiA →A yjA ) ⇐⇒ (εji = 1) if 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n and
A A
A
A A
k < j. We also have xA
i ⊥ yi for i > k and (xi → xj ⇔ xi → xj ) for k < i < j.
A
A
We put edges between xi and yj in order for them to respect the parity condition. Remark
that there is more than one way to do this, for instance one can ask that when k < i < j,
A A
A A
A A
(xA
yj ) ⇔ (xA
xj ) and (xA
yi ) ⇔ (yjA →A yiA ). The remaining edges can be
i →
i →
j →
added arbitrarily because they concern columns with only one vertex.
We make sure that A ∈ S. Indeed, noting that since there is one point in the ﬁrst k columns,
and two in the remaining ones, it suﬃces to check the parity condition in the last n − k columns.
A
A
Take k < j < i ≤ n. We know that the edges between xA
i and yj and the edge between xi and
A
A
A
xj go in the same direction. Similarly, the edge between xj and yi and the edge between yjA
and yiA also go in the same direction. Therefore the parity condition must be respected.
A
A
S
Remark that ((y1A , . . . , ykA , xA
k+1 , . . . , xn ), → ) and ((y1 , . . . , yk , xk+1 , . . . , xn ), → ) are isoA
morphic, hence A embeds in S in a way that extends this isomorphism. The image of (yk+1
, . . . , ynA )
is as wanted.

The fundamental observation for the proof of Proposition 3 is that if we take x1 , . . . , xn ∈ S
all in diﬀerent columns,

U(xi )ni=1 ,ε = g · U(xσ(i) )ni=1 ,α .
This means that all sets of this form have the same measure, hence we will have the result
n
because there are n!2( 2 ) such sets.
First, we construct g ′ ∈ G such that
g ′ · U(xσ(i) )ni=1 ,α = Ux1 ,...,xn ,β
for some β = (βij )1≤i<j≤n .
We want to prove that there is g ′ ∈ G such that g ′ · xi ∈ (xσ(i) )⊥ . By Lemma 5, there exists
′
x1 , . . . , x′n ∈ S such that xσ(i) ⊥ x′i and xi → xj iﬀ x′i → x′j . Remark that by construction, there
is a partial automorphism τ that sends xσ(i) to x′i . By homogeneity, there is g ′ an automorphism
of S that extends τ . We remark that
g ′ · U(xi )ni=1 ,α = U(x′σ(i) )ni=1 ,α
and as we observed before, U(x′σ(i) )ni=1 ,α does not depend on x′i , but on their columns. Thus,
there exist a family β = (βij )1≤i<j≤n such that
U(x′σ(i) )ni=1 ,α = U(xi )ni=1 ,β .
Next, we construct h ∈ G such that
U(xi )ni=1 ,ε = h · U(xi )ni=1 ,β .
Assume that there are k < l such that βij = εji for all (i, j) 6= (k, l) and βkl 6= εlk . Remark
that taking care of this case will be enough to prove the result : If α and β disagree in more
than one coordinate, iterating this process still allows to modify coordinates one at a time.
Let us take x′k ⊥ xk such that for all i ∈ [n]\{k, l}, x′k → xi iﬀ xk → xi and x′k → xl
iﬀ xl → xk . This is possible using Lemma 5 where {y1 , . . . , yn−1 } = {x1 , . . . , xn }\{xk } and
′
Pn = x⊥
k . We deﬁne xl ⊥ xl similarly.
We take h ∈ G such that h(xi ) = xi for all i ∈ [n]\{k, l}, h(x′k ) = xk and h(x′l ) = xl . By
homogeneity, such a h exists: indeed, by the parity condition, we have (xk → xl ) ⇔ (x′k → x′l ).
Let us prove that h gives the result.
Take E ∈ Ux1 ,...,xn ,β . We will prove that
h · E ∈ U(xi )ni=1 ,ε .
For all i < j we want to prove that
j

Rh·E (xi , xj ) ⇔ (xi → xj )εi ,
and since
Rh·E (xi , xj ) ⇔ RE (h−1 (xi ), h−1 (xj )),
we prove
j

RE (h−1 (xi ), h−1 (xj )) ⇔ (xi → xj )εi .
If {i, j} ∩ {k, l} = ∅, the result is obvious.
If j = k and i < k, we have:
Rh·E (xi , xk ) ⇔ RE (h−1 (xi ), h−1 (xk ))
k

⇔ (xi → h−1 (xk ))βi
k

⇔ (xi → x′k )βi

k

⇔ (xi → xk )βi ,
and since βik = εki , we have
k

Rh·E (xi , xk ) ⇔ (xi → xk )εi .

COLIN JAHEL

The other cases where |{i, j} ∩ {k, l}| = 1 are similar.
Finally, if (i, j) = (k, l), we have:
Rh·E (xk , xl ) ⇔ RE (h−1 (xk ), h−1 (xl ))
l

⇔ (xk → h−1 (xl ))βk
l

⇔ (xk → x′l )βk
l

⇔ (xk → xl )εk .
The last equivalence is a direct consequence of the deﬁnition of x′l and the fact that βkl =
(1 − εlk ).

Since LO(a11 ) is compact, by Theorem B, if we prove that ν is H-ergodic, then we have the
result. Indeed, then ν is an extreme point of the H-invariant measures and all the νVl are equal

and this equality ﬁnishes the induction.
It only remains to prove the ergodicity of ν. The following lemma will allow us to conclude.
Lemma 6. Let K be a group acting on a set N with no finite orbits. Denote LO(N ) the space
of linear orderings on N . Then the uniform measure λ on LO(N ) is K-ergodic.
Proof. Take A a Borel subset of LO(N ) such that for all g ∈ K λ(A△g · A) = 0. Let ε > 0.
There is a cylinder, i.e. a set depending only on a ﬁnite set of N , B = B(b1 , . . . , bk ) such
that µ(B△A) ≤ ε. Using Neumann’s Lemma, we get that there exists g ∈ K such that
{b1 , . . . , bk } ∩ g · {b1 , . . . , bk } = ∅.
Moreover, since ν is uniform, the orderings of two disjoint sets of points are independent.
Indeed, taking (a1 , . . . , ai ) and (c1 , . . . , ci′ ) two disjoint families of points. Note that λ(a1 <
· · · < ai ∩ c1 < · · · < ci′ ) is equal to the number of way to insert (c1 , . . . , ci′ ) in (a1 , . . . , ai )
respecting both orderings times the weight of a given ordering of (a1 , . . . , ai , c1 , . . . , ci′ ). We
therefore have

λ(a1 < · · · < ai ∩ c1 < · · · < c ) =

This means that B and g · B are independent. We can now write:
i′

λ(A) − λ(A)2 = λ(A ∩ g · A) − λ(A)2
≤ |λ(A ∩ g · A) − λ(B ∩ g · A)| + |λ(B ∩ g · A) − λ(B ∩ g · B)|
+ λ(B ∩ g · B) − λ(B)2 + λ(B)2 − ν(A)2
≤4ε.
The last inequality comes from the following inequalities
|λ(A ∩ g · A) − λ(B ∩ g · A)| ≤ λ((A△B) ∩ g · A) ≤ ε,
|λ(B ∩ g · A) − λ(B ∩ g · B)| ≤ λ(g · (A△B) ∩ B) ≤ ε,
λ(B ∩ g · B) = λ(B)2
and
λ(B)2 − λ(A)2 = (λ(A) + λ(B))|λ(A) − λ(B)| ≤ 2ε.

This proves that λ is K-ergodic.

We only have to prove that H has no ﬁnite orbits on (a11 )⊥ . It suﬃces to remark that for
all a ∈ S, (u1 , . . . , ui ) ∈ S, there are inﬁnitely many b ∈ a⊥ such that a → uj iﬀ b → uj for all
1 ≤ j ≤ i.
Indeed, take k ∈ N. Consider the structure ((a1 , . . . , ak , v1 , . . . , vi ), →), where al ⊥ aj ,
al → vk iﬀ a → uk and vm → vm′ iﬀ um → um′ for all l, j ≤ k and m, m′ ≤ i. It is obvious
that this structure veriﬁes the parity condition. Therefore in S we can ﬁnd k copies of a in its
column for any k > 0.
This is enough to conclude that ν is indeed H-ergodic.

It will follow that µ = µ0 .

Let us take a certain set {x1 , . . . , xn } where none of the xi are in the same column. We denote
m the number of sets U as above associated to this family. We consider (Ui )m
i=1 the disjoint
sets of M corresponding to the ways of deﬁning a relation R and an order on the columns
⊥
(n2 ) . Proposition 3 tells us that:

i=1
∀i, j ∈ {1, . . . , m}, µ(Ui ) = µ(Uj ).
We remark that this quantity is

m.

We now deﬁne, for all i ∈ {1, . . . , m},

µUi (·) =

µ (· ∩ Ui )

µ (Ui )

This is the conditional probability of µ given Ui . Denote H the subgroup of G that stabilizes

i for i 6= j. Remark that H stabilizes

Let LOp (S) denote the space of partial orders that are total on each column and do not
compare elements of diﬀerent columns. There is a restriction map from M to LOp (S). We
consider λ the pushfoward of µ on LOp (S) by this map. Similarly, we consider λUi the pushfoward
of µUi on LOp (S). We have
m

λ=

m i=1 i
The rest of the proof is similar to the proof of Proposition 4: we prove that λ is H-ergodic.
Take A a Borel subset of LOp (S) such that for all h ∈ H, λ(A△h · A) = 0. For any ε > 0, there
is a cylinder B that depends only on ﬁnitely many points (b1 , . . . , bk ) such that λ(A△B) ≤ ε.
We now want to ﬁnd an element g ∈ H such that B and g · B are λ-independent.
Take A ∈ S, then consider A′ as a structure that contains disjoints copies of A that we call
A1 and A2 . We impose that all edges between elements of A1 and elements of A2 go from
A1 to A2 . Necessarily, A′ ∈ S, so in S there are copies of any ﬁnite substructure that lives
in a disjoint set of columns. Therefore, there is an element g ∈ G such that (b1 , . . . , bk ) and

g · (b1 , . . . , bk ) are in disjoint sets of columns. It is easy to see by Proposition 4 that B and g · B
are λ-independent.
Just as in the proof of Proposition 4, we have:
λ(A) − λ(A)2 = λ(A ∩ g · A) − λ(A)2
≤ |λ(A ∩ g · A) − λ(B ∩ g · A)| + |λ(B ∩ g · A) − λ(B ∩ g · B)|
+ λ(B ∩ g · B) − λ(B)2 + λ(B)2 − λ(A)2
≤4ε.
Thus λ(A) ∈ {0, 1}.
Since LOp (S) is compact, we have the result: λ is an extreme point of the H-invariant
measures and all the λUi are equal. Therefore we have,
µ(V ∩ Ui ) = µUi (V )µ(Ui )
= λUi (V )µ(Ui )
= λ(V )µ(Ui )
= µ(V )µ(Ui )
for all i ∈ {1, . . . , m}, and V = V(a11 ,...,a1i
