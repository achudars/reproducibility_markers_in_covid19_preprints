Abstract
This paper deals with M2 -signals, namely multivariate (or vector-valued) signals defined over a multidimensional domain.
In particular, we propose an optimization technique to solve the covariance extension problem for stationary random vector
fields. The multidimensional Itakura-Saito distance is employed as an optimization criterion to select the solution among the
spectra satisfying a finite number of moment constraints. In order to avoid technicalities that may happen on the boundary
of the feasible set, we deal with the discrete version of the problem where the multidimensional integrals are approximated by
Riemann sums. The spectrum solution is also discrete, which occurs naturally when the underlying random field is periodic.
We show that a solution to the discrete problem exists, is unique and depends smoothly on the problem data. Therefore,
we have a well-posed problem whose solution can be tuned in a smooth manner. Finally, we have applied our theory to the
target parameter estimation problem in an integrated system of automotive modules. Simulation results show that our spectral
estimator has promising performance.
Key words: Multidimensional matrix covariance extension, Itakura-Saito distance, trigonometric moment problem, spectral
estimation.

Introduction

Moment problems are ubiquitous in the areas of systems and control, where the moment conditions dictate
system properties that needs to be satisfied. In this paper we consider a spectral estimation problem where the
moment conditions ensure that the system covariances
coincide with measured values (Stoica and Moses, 2005;
Lindquist and Picci, 2015). The latter is known as rational covariance extension problem, which was initially

proposed in Kalman (1982): For a given (scalar) partial
covariance sequence of n elements, determine all infinite
extensions such that the corresponding spectral density
is nonnegative and rational with degree bounded by n.
Note that the bound on the degree is a non-convex constraint, but it naturally gives a bound on the complexity
of the resulting system.
The solution to this problem was presented in Byrnes
et al. (1995) (see also Georgiou (1983) for an existence result) and led to a convex optimization approach (Byrnes
et al., 1998) where the extension is the maximizer of an
entropy functional. This way of selecting extensions as
maximizers of suitable functionals has been extensively
studied, in particular in the unidimensional and univariate setting (Georgiou, 1999; Byrnes et al., 2000, 2001,
2002; Enqvist, 2004). Then, these spectral estimation
paradigms have been extended to other types of functionals, which also typically come with guaranteed upper bounds of the degree of the extensions (Enqvist and
Karlsson, 2008; Ferrante et al., 2008; Zorzi, 2014a,b).
More precisely, the power spectral density matches the

an a priori bounded McMillan degree, and the bound is
as good as the one in the scalar case (Byrnes et al., 1995;
Byrnes and Lindquist, 1997). Thus, this leads to multivariate and multidimensional spectral analysis where
information in terms of the covariances and the prior
spectrum is fused in order to improve the estimates of
the spectrum. Finally, we utilize the theory for parameter estimation in an integrated system of two automotive
modules, and the numerical examples suggest that our
method gives higher accuracy and robustness compared
to the traditional periodogram-based method which represents the most straightforward way to compute an estimator of the spectrum from the data.

partial covariance sequence and minimizes a pseudodistance with respect to a prior spectral density which
represents the a priori information on the system. Several matrix-valued versions have also been considered
(Georgiou, 2006; Blomqvist et al., 2003; Ramponi et al.,
2009; Zorzi, 2015b; Ferrante et al., 2012a; Zorzi, 2015a;
Pavon and Ferrante, 2013; Zhu and Baggio, 2019; Zhu,
2020). It is worth noting that the Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation problem is a special case of this framework,
and this fact has been useful for applying the theory to
control design (Nagamune and Blomqvist, 2005; Takyar
et al., 2008; Karlsson et al., 2010; Kergus et al., 2019).
Most of these works are on dynamical systems in one
variable (i.e. unidimensional systems), typically representing time. However, many problems in systems and
control are inherently multidimensional (Bose, 2003).
Multidimensional systems theory has been applied to
many different problems, for example random Markov
fields (Levy et al., 1990), image processing (Ekstrom,
1984) and target parameter estimation in radar applications (Rohling and Kronauge, 2012; Engels, 2014). Interest has therefore also been directed towards multidimensional versions of the rational covariance extension
problem (Georgiou, 2006, 2005; Ringh et al., 2015; Karlsson et al., 2016). Most of the aforementioned works deal
with the multidimensional and univariate case. However,
there are situations in which the model is multidimensional and multivariate, say M2 . An example is given by
the integrated system of automotive modules proposed
in Zhu et al. (2019): the latter is composed by a certain
number of uniform linear arrays (ULAs) of receive antennas sharing one common transmitter.

The outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we formulate the optimization problem. In Section 3 we prove
the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the problem by means of duality theory. In Section 4 we show that
the solution depends continuously on the problem data.
Then, we introduce the corresponding M2 spectral estimator in Section 5, where we also provide a method to
compute the covariance lags which guarantee the feasibility of the optimization problem. Section 6 shows some
numerical experiments. Finally, in Section 7 we draw the
conclusions.
Notations
In the following E denotes the mathematical expectation, Z the set of integers, R the real line, and C the complex plane. The symbol Hn represents the vector space
(over the reals) of n × n Hermitian matrices, and H+,n is
the subset that contains positive definite matrices. The
notation (·)∗ means taking complex conjugate transpose
when applied to a matrix. The symbol k · k may denote
the norm of a matrix, a linear operator, or a function
depending on the context.

A natural approximation of the rational covariance extension problem is to restrict the support of the function to a discrete grid. This was studied in Lindquist
and Picci (2013) for the unidimensional and univariate
case, and is also called the circulant rational covariance
extension problem since it can be viewed as limiting the
stationary process to be periodic with period N . A unidimensional and multivariate extension has been considered in Lindquist et al. (2013), while the multidimensional and univariate case has been addressed in Ringh
et al. (2015). However the multidimensional and multivariable case has not been completely addressed yet.

Problem formulation

Suppose that we have a second-order stationary random field {y(t), t = (t1 , t2 , . . . , td ) ∈ Zd } where the
positive integer d is the dimension of the index set. For
each t ∈ Zd , y(t) is an m-dimensional zero mean complex random vector. The covariance is defined as Σk :=
E y(t + k)y(t)∗ which does not depend on t by stationarity. In addition, we have the symmetry Σ−k = Σ∗k .
The spectral density of the random field is defined as the
Fourier transform of the matrix field {Σk , k ∈ Zd }

In this paper, we consider the multidimensional and
multivariable (M2 ) version of the circulant rational covariance extension problem. This discrete version of the
problem allows to avoid technicalities that may happen
on the boundary of the feasible set. A natural choice of
functional is the Itakura-Saito divergence (Enqvist and
Karlsson, 2008), since it can be extended to matrix valued spectra and also allows for incorporating the a priori
information (Ferrante et al., 2012a). Moreover, as argued
in Ferrante et al. (2012a) in the 1-d case, the IS-distance
leads to a solution with low complexity. More precisely,
the linear filter determined by the resulting spectrum has

Φ(eiθ ) :=

X

Σk e−ihk, θi ,

(1)

k∈Zd

where θ = (θ1 , θ2 , . . . , θd ) takes valued in Td :=
(−π, π]d , eiθ is a shorthand for (eiθ1 , . . . , eiθd ), and
hk, θi := k1 θ1 + · · · + kd θd is the usual inner product in

2

Rd . Given the symmetry of the covariances, one can easily verify that Φ is a Hermitian matrix-valued function
on Td .

Here the symbol Sm denotes the family of H+,m -valued
functions defined on Td that are bounded and coercive.
The spectral density function Ψ which we call prior, is
given and it is interpreted as an extra piece of information that we have on the solution Φ. More precisely, we
want to find a solution to the moment equations (2) that
is closest to Ψ as measured by D. If no prior is available,
we can select Ψ = I in the spirit of maximizing the entropy, in which one aims to find the most unpredictable
process with the prescribed moments. The maximum
entropy (ME) paradigm is well accepted in the literature, as its meaningfulness has been discussed in Csiszar
(1991). The unidimensional version of this optimization
problem has been well studied in Ferrante et al. (2012a),
which can be seen as a multivariate generalization of
the scalar problem investigated in Enqvist and Karlsson
(2008).

Often in practice, a realization of the field y is observed
at a finite number of indices t and we want to estimate
the spectrum of the field from these observations. We
shall proceed along the idea of rational covariance extension (Kalman, 1982), starting by considering the covariances {Σk , k ∈ Λ}, where Λ ⊂ Zd is a finite index
set such that
(1) 0 ∈ Λ,
(2) k ∈ Λ =⇒ −k ∈ Λ.
Then we aim to find a spectral density that matches
these covariances. Formally, the problem is to find a function Φ : Td → H+,m that solves the integral equations

A similar covariance extension problem for random
scalar fields has been studied in Ringh et al. (2015, 2016,
2018) using a different cost function (cf. also Karlsson
et al. (2016) for a more general setting). Unlike the
corresponding unidimensional problem, in the multidimensional case, the solution to the optimization problem, namely a spectral measure that solves the moment
equations, in general can contain a singular part. This
is a consequence of the fact that a certain integrability
condition can fail to hold when the dimension d ≥ 3
(see Ringh et al. (2016, Section 4) for details). However,
such a singular measure is not unique, and its practical
importance is so far still unclear.

is the normalized Lebesgue measure over Td . The most
common situation which will be the one referred to in our
estimation procedure is the case in which Λ is a cuboid
centered at the origin.

An interesting exception is reported in Ringh et al.
(2015) where a “circulant” version of the multidimensional covariance extension problem has been considered. There the spectral density function has support on
a grid of Td (denoted as TdN ) and Fourier integrals such
as those in (2) are replaced by (inverse) discrete Fourier
transforms. It is shown in that paper that given a positive trigonometric polynomial P on TdN , there exists a
unique polynomial Q that is also positive on TdN , such
that the rational function Φ = P/Q solves the moment
equations. In this case, no singular measure arises, which
is exactly analogous to the main result in Lindquist and
Picci (2013) that treats the unidimensional problem.

When the integral equations (2) are solvable, they usually have infinitely many solutions, and thus the problem above is not well-posed. The common approach in a
still active line of research is to utilize entropy-like functionals as optimization criteria to select solutions. In the
same spirit of Ferrante et al. (2012a), we introduce the
multidimensional version of the Itakura-Saito (IS) distance between two bounded and coercive 1 spectral densities

It is not difficult to see (cf. e.g., Lindquist and Picci,
2015, p. 435) that the latter is a pseudo-distance because
D(Φ, Ψ) ≥ 0 and the equality holds if and only if Φ = Ψ
(almost everywhere).

Next we shall mainly work on the discrete version of the
optimization problem in (5). Let us set up the notation
first. The product set Td = (−π, π]d is discretized such
that Nj equidistant points are selected from the j-th
factor (−π, π]. More precisely, let us fix

are essentially Riemann sums.
There are two reasons to prefer the discrete formulation
(9).
i) From the numerical aspect, we will have to discretize the problem when implementing an algorithm on a computer, and we may as well treat the
discretized problem in the first place. Moreover, the
fast Fourier transform (FFT) can be used to compute quantities such as the moments.
ii) The number of available data is anyway finite so
that a discrete theory appears natural. As we will
see, it will provide nice and elegant theory with no
need to consider ad hoc singular measures.

Repeat the argument in each dimension, and we conclude that the support of dF is in fact contained in the
grid TdN .
Apparently, the random field being periodic leads to the
periodicity of the covariance field {Σk }k∈Zd . More precisely, we have that in the j-th dimension
Σk = Σ(k1 ,...,kj−1 ,kj +Nj ,kj+1 ,...,kd ) .

In addition, the discrete spectrum defined over TdN has
a probabilistic interpretation of corresponding to a periodic stationary field, as we shall explain below.

Therefore, we can restrict our attention to one particular d-cuboid {Σk }k∈Zd . Moreover, combining the periN

which is another kind of symmetry for the covariances
around the “end points” of the d-cuboid. In the unidimensional case (d = 1), the above equality reduces to
Σ−k+N = Σ∗k , which adds a block-circulant structure on
the covariance matrix Σ := E YY∗ , where Y is a long
column vector of random variables obtained by stacking
y(0), . . . , y(N ) together (see e.g., Carli et al., 2011). In

The dual optimization problem

In this section, we will elaborate how to solve the optimization problem (9) via duality. In the first place, we
make a feasibility assumption.

The function LΨ (·, Q) is strictly convex in the feasible

Remark 1 In Ringh et al. (2015), the feasibility assumption is stated in terms of a dual cone formulation.
See also Karlsson et al. (2016); Ringh et al. (2016, 2018).
As we shall see next, the feasibility assumption plays an
important role in the development of the theory, and later
in Section 5, an estimator of the covariances will be proposed such that the above assumption is satisfied in practice. Another way to deal with the feasibility can be found
in Enqvist and Avventi (2007); Ringh et al. (2018).

in any direction δΦ. In particular, taking δΦ = −Φ−1 +
Ψ−1 + Q implies

Notice that due to discretization, the optimization problem (9) is a finite dimensional problem subject to a finite
number of linear equality constraints. In the literature
of optimization theory, there are methods to handle this
type of problems directly. However, it is usually more
convenient to work with the dual problem, because the
number of dual variables is proportional to the cardinality of the set Λ while the number of primal variables is
proportional to the grid size |N| which is usually much
larger than the former.

We claim that if a minimizer Q◦ of JΨ exists, it is unique.
This is a consequence of the strict convexity of the cost

Since Φ◦ (ζ ` ) is positive definite for any ζ ` , the second variation of JΨ is equal to zero if and only if the
polynomial δQ(z) vanishes identically on the discrete dtorus corresponding to the frequencies in TdN . We shall
make the following innocuous assumption for the strict
positivity of the second variation. For j = 1, . . . , d, let
nj := max{|kj | : k ∈ Λ}, the largest index in the j-th
dimension.

It is not difficult to see that the differential δJΨ (Q; δQ)
is continuous in Q for any fixed direction δQ. In fact, it

δQ(z) ≡ 0, i.e. the zero polynomial. We can now conclude that the dual problem (19) is strictly convex. The
uniqueness of the solution is an easy consequence of the
strict convexity, provided that a solution exists. The
existence question is indeed the difficult part, which is

the boundary of the set L+ ,

∂L+ := {Q : Ψ + Q ≥ 0 on

where we have used the fact that log det X = tr log X
for X > 0. The matrix (Ψ−1 + Q)(ζ ` ) is positive definite
since we have the condition Q ∈ L+ , and let {λj (ζ ` )}m

be its eigenvalues. Then the above inequality can be written as

and the closure L+ := L+ ∪ ∂L+ .
Proposition 1 For any Q ∈ L+ , the function value
JΨ (Q) is bounded from below.

JΨ (Q) ≥ α +

In particular, this implies that the dual function JΨ cannot attain a value of −∞ on L+ . To prove the proposition, we need the following lemma.

in the orthant {(λ1 , . . . , λm ) : λj > 0, ∀j = 1, . . . , m}.
Its minimizer is the stationary point λj = 1/µ > 0,
j = 1, . . . , m with a minimum value m(1 + log µ). We
thus obtain a uniform lower bound for the function

satisfies the moment equations in (9b) for all k ∈ Λ. One
can see that there exists a positive constant µ such that

This is true because the usual Lebesgue measure is replaced by the discrete measure dνN in the integrals during the discretization of the optimization problem. In
sharp contrast, as reported in Ferrante et al. (2012a)
for the unidimensional problem, the dual function may
still have a finite value on the boundary of the feasible set when the integration is done with respect to the
Lebesgue measure.

The next step is to prove that η = hQ0∞ , Σi > 0. Following the computation in (22), we arrive at

the norm of the object Q = {Qk : k ∈ Λ} that contains
the Lagrange multipliers. We have the next lemma.
Lemma 2 Let {Qk }k≥1 be a sequence in L+ such that
kQk k → ∞ as k → ∞. Then there exists a subsequence

is positive definite on TdN for all sufficiently large k since
kQk k → ∞. To summarize, the sequence {Q0k } lives on
the unit surface kQk = 1 (a compact set due to finite dimensionality), and we have Q0k ∈ L+ for k large enough.

Define the real quantity η := lim inf k→∞ hQ0k , Σi. Then
it must hold that η ≥ 0. By a property of the limit inferior, we know that {Q0k } has a subsequence {Q0k` } such
that hQ0k` , Σi → η as ` → ∞. Since {Q0k` }`≥1 is contained on the unit surface, it has a convergent subsequence denoted by {Q0kj }j≥1 . Define the limit
Q0∞ := lim Q0kj .
j→∞

The function Ψ−1 /kQkj k + Q0kj has bounded norm over
TdN . Hence the integral of its log det is bounded from
above. Comparing linear and logarithmic growth, we can
make the conclusion (29).
As a consequence of Lemma 2, the sublevel set
−1
JΨ
(−∞, r] has to be bounded. Therefore, it is a compact subset of L+ . By the extreme value theorem, the
function JΨ has a minimum over the sublevel set, and
the minimizer Q◦ is in L+ . This concludes the existence
proof.

(32)

Then by the continuity of the inner product, we have
η = hQ0∞ , Σi.
Next, we show that Q0∞ ∈ L+ . Since Qk ∈ L+ , it holds
that Ψ−1 + Qk > 0 on TdN for all k. This implies that
Ψ−1
+ Q0kj > 0 on TdN , ∀j.
kQkj k

Now we have shown that the dual problem (19) has a
unique solution. The remaining claim of Theorem 1 follows from strong duality, i.e., zero duality gap.

(33)

The function on the left side of the above inequality
converges uniformly to the polynomial Q0∞ on TdN . Hence
we must have Q0∞ ≥ 0 on TdN . As a consequence, Ψ−1 +
Q0∞ > 0 on TdN and indeed Q0∞ ∈ L+ .

Well-posedness

In the previous section, we have demonstrated that the
optimization problem (9) has a unique solution via duality. These properties, although necessary, are far from
being sufficient for the problem to make sense from the

8

For a fixed Ψ that is positive definite on TdN , define the
section of the map

engineering point of view. Indeed, to this end it is fundamental that the solution depends continuously on the
problem data. In this section we show that this is the
case and that, in fact, the problem is well-posed in the
sense of Hadamard. To show this, we are left to establish the smooth dependence of the solution Q on the
problem data, namely the prior spectral density Ψ and
the covariance matrices Σ = {Σk }k∈Λ . The argument
is built upon the classical inverse and implicit function
theorems.

ω( · ) := f (Ψ, · ) : L+ → M+ .
Theorem 2 The map ω is a diffeomorphism.

PROOF. Given a Σ ∈ M+ , a solution to the equation
ω(Q) = Σ is a stationary point of the dual function JΨ
according to (20). By Theorem 1, such a stationary point
exists and is unique. Therefore, the map ω is a bijection.
From the definition of ω, one has Dω(Q) = D2 f (Ψ, Q),
i.e. the derivative of ω is equal to the partial derivative
of f with respect to the second argument. It then follows
from Proposition 2 that ω is a smooth function.

Define first the linear operator that sends a Hermitianmatrix-valued function on TdN to its discrete Fourier coefficients with indices in the set Λ

It now remains to prove the smoothness of the inverse
ω −1 , and this is an easy consequence of the inverse function theorem (cf. Lang, 1999, Theorem 5.2, p. 15). In
order to see it, just notice that Dω(Q) is equal to the
Hessian of the cost function JΨ at Q except for a sign
difference. From Subsection 3.1, we know that the Hessian is positive definite for any Q ∈ L+ . Hence Dω(Q)
is certainly a vector space isomorphism. By the inverse
function theorem, we can conclude that ω is a local diffeomorphism at Q, and this implies the smoothness of
ω −1 .

Let

M+ := Σ = Γ(Φ) : Φ(ζ ` ) > 0, ∀` ∈ ZdN

(37)

be the set of moments corresponding to discrete spectral
density functions. Define the set
D :=



(Ψ, Q) : Ψ(ζ ` ) > 0, (Ψ−1 + Q)(ζ ` ) > 0,
∀` ∈ ZdN .
(38)

Remark 2 As a consequence of Theorem 2 we have that
for a fixed Ψ, the map s(Ψ, · ) : M+ → L+ is continuous. Theorem 2 also implies that the set M+ of moments
indexed by Λ is open.

Due to discretization, both Ψ and Q live in a finite dimensional vector space. Consider the map
f : D → M+
(Ψ, Q) 7→ Γ((Ψ−1 + Q)−1 ).

We shall next show the well-posedness in the other argument, namely continuity of the map

Given Σ ∈ M+ , we aim to solve the equation
f (Ψ, Q) = Σ.

(41)

s( · , Σ) : Ψ 7→ Q

(42)

when Σ is held fixed. Clearly, it is equivalent to solving
the functional equation (40) for Q in terms of Ψ when
its right-hand side is fixed, which naturally falls in to the
scope of the implicit function theorem.

When Ψ is fixed, this is in fact equivalent to the stationarity condition ∇JΨ (Q) = 0 of the dual function (19),
as explained in Subsection 3.1. Moreover, according to
Theorem 1, given a prior Ψ and the moments {Σk }k∈Λ
that are feasible, the solution Q exists and is unique,
and it can be obtained by minimizing the dual function
(19). In other words, the solution map

Theorem 3 For a fixed Σ ∈ M+ , the implicit function
s( · , Σ) in (42) is smooth.

is well defined. We will next show that the solution map
is smooth in either one of the two arguments when the
other one is held fixed, as a consequence of Theorem 1.
The proof of the proposition below is deferred to the
Appendix.

PROOF. Fix a Ψ that is positive definite on TdN and
let Q be the solution to (40). Since the function Ψ−1 + Q
is positive definite on TdN , it is not difficult to argue that
there exist (open) neighborhoods U, V of Ψ and Q, respectively, such that Ψ̃−1 + Q̃ remains positive definite
on TdN for any Ψ̃ ∈ U and Q̃ ∈ V using Lemma 3 in
Appendix. We can therefore consider the function f restricted to U × V.

Proposition 2 The map f is smooth (of class C ∞ ) on
its domain D.

The assertion then follows directly from the implicit
function theorem (see, e.g., Lang, 1999, Theorem 5.9,

(9). In the unidimensional case (d = 1) with the normalized Lebesgue measure, feasibility can be checked
and enforced (Zorzi and Ferrante, 2012; Ferrante et al.,
2012b) as it is equivalent to a simple algebraic condition. More precisely, given a finite sequence of estimates

f (Ψ̃, g(Ψ̃)) = Σ

for all Ψ̃ ∈ U0 . Because there is a unique solution Q̃
corresponding to each Ψ̃, the restriction of s( · , Σ) on U0

is positive definite. The proof of this fact is intrinsically
related to the factorization problem of positive matrix
Laurent polynomials. A similar positivity condition exists in high dimensional cases. For example, in the 2-d
case, a block-Toeplitz matrix with Toeplitz blocks is required to be positive definite (cf. Geronimo and Woerdeman, 2004). However, when the dimension d > 1, such
a positivity condition is only a necessary condition for
the existence of a solution to the moment equations, and
a sufficient condition seems yet unknown, partly due to
the fact that the factorization problem is quite difficult
even for scalar polynomials in several variables (see e.g.,
Geronimo and Lai, 2006).

(43)

where N1 , . . . , Nd are some positive integers. Since we do
not have observations outside the index set ZdN defined
in (7), we assume that the underlying random field is
N-periodic (cf. Subsection 2.1) whose spectral density is
denoted by Φ(ζ ` ) such that Φ(ζ ` ) > 0 for all ` ∈ ZdN .
In view of Section 2, a possible spectral estimate is obtained as follows:
(1) Set
Λ = {k ∈ Zd : |kj | ≤ nj , j = 1, . . . , d},

In view of the difficulty of attacking the feasibility question directly, in this section we will instead give a method
that guarantees the feasibility of our optimization problem. Essentially, this is a multivariate and multidimensional generalization of the standard biased covariance
estimates for scalar unidimensional processes reported
in Stoica and Moses (2005, Chapter 2). Define the finite
Fourier transform

for which Assumption 1 holds;
(3) An estimate of Φ(ζ ` ) is the solution to (9) where
Σk has been replaced with Σ̂k .
Notice that Λ is a d-dimensional box and condition Nj >
2nj guarantees that Assumption 2 holds. The estimates
{Σ̂k , k ∈ Λ} may be computed from the data by taking the sample covariance and clearly they are “reliable”
provided that Nj  nj , i.e., the dataset Y is long enough
along each dimension. In what follows, the spectral estimator obtained as above will be denoted by Φ̂(eiθ ).

the bias term ε/|N|I guarantees that Φ̂p (eiθ ) is positive

The remaining nontrivial step is to construct the set of

It is worth noting that Φ̂p (ζ ` ) is a crude estimator of

assume that only one target is present in the field of
view. Our measurements come from two uniform linear
arrays (ULAs) of receive antennas denoted by R1 and
R2, respectively, in Fig. 1. The two ULAs are placed in
the same line at a distance ∆d, say a few decimeters. In
a very short time interval at the scale of 20 ms (called
“coherent processing interval”), the scalar measurement
of each ULA is modeled as a 3-d complex sinusoid (cf.
Engels, 2014), that is, for each vector t ∈ Z3N ,

where the subscripts 1, 2 label the ULAs. Model (63)
holds under the far field assumption which is common
in this kind of radar applications. The meaning of each
variable will be explained next. The index t takes values in the set (7) with the dimension d = 3, and the
vector N = [N1 , N2 , N3 ] corresponds to the size of the
measurement. Here the integer N1 denotes the number
of samples per pulse, N2 the number of pulses, and N3
the number of (receive) antennas. The scalar a is a real
amplitude. The variable ϕ is an initial phase angle of
the first measurement channel which is assumed to be
a random variable uniformly distributed in [−π, π] (cf.
Stoica and Moses, 2005, Section 4.1). The processes wk
(k = 1, 2) are uncorrelated zero-mean circular complex
white noises with the same variance σ 2 , and both are
independent of ϕ. The real vector θ = [θ1 θ2 θ3 ] ∈ T3
contains three unknown normalized angular target frequencies. The components θj (j = 1, 2, 3) are related to
the range r, the (radial) relative velocity v, and the azimuth angle α of the target via simple invertible functions (see Engels, 2014, Section 16.4), such that the target parameter vector (r, v, α) can be readily recovered
from the frequency vector θ. The number M = ∆d/∆s
where ∆s is the distance between two adjacent antennas
in the ULA, and M θ3 represents the phase shift between
the measurements of the two ULAs due to the distance
∆d. The target parameter estimation problem consists
in estimating the unknown target frequencies θ from the
sinusoid-in-noise measurements generated according to
model (63).

Such a frequency estimation problem has been extensively studied in the literature (see, e.g., Stoica and
Moses, 2005, Chapter 4), and many methods have been
proposed to solve it, in the case of a single ULA. We
will address the problem via M2 spectral estimation as
explained next. Notice that the current problem setup
falls into our M2 framework because two ULAs produce
a multivariable (bivariate) signal and the three physical
quantities of the target (azimuth angle, velocity, range)
relating to the angular frequencies give rise to a three dimensional domain. Set y(t) := [ y1 (t) y2 (t) ]> . Through

the problem is the same as that in Zhu et al. (2019)

above spectrum is singular, the idea is to approximate it
with a nonsingular spectrum with a peak in θ. Therefore,
we first compute an estimate Φ̂ of the ideal spectrum
from the radar measurements following the procedure
described in Section 5. Then we use the post-processing
method proposed in Zhu et al. (2019) to obtain an estimate of the target frequency vector via

We report below one numerical example in which the
data size N = [30 30 8], the amplitude of the sinusoid
a = 1, the number M = 20, and the noise variance
σ 2 = 2. The grid size of the discrete 3-torus is the same
as N. The true frequency vector for the data generation is θ = [0.8101 − 0.5872 2.1798], while its quantized version on T3N is θ q = [0.8378 − 0.6283 2.3562]
corresponding to the 3-d index [5 28 4]. 3 In what follows we consider the estimator of Section 5, denoted by
IS, where the set Λ is defined in (44) with n = [1 1 1].
The prior is taken as Ψ ≡ Σ̂0 , the (constant) estimated
zeroth moment. The IS solver is initialized with Q = 0
which is feasible since we have Σ̂0 > 0 according to
the estimation scheme (57). We compare the IS method
with the two windowed M2 periodograms proposed in
Zhu et al. (2019), one with a rectangular window of size
[8 8 2], denoted by RECT, and the other with a Bartlett
window of size [12 12 3], denoted by BART. Using the

and our method return the same frequency estimate θ q ,
which is the best grid point that approximates the true
θ. However, from Figs. 2, 3, and 4, showing the three
sections of the function kΦ̂(eiω )k2F for the different estimated spectra, only the IS estimator exhibits a proper
peak that is clearly distinguishable form possible background noise. The latter property is desirable for the
peak detection task. We have also run Monte-Carlo simulations for this frequency estimation task. Under the
parameter configuration above, the IS method performs
in the same way as the M2 periodogram-based spectral
estimators as measured by the error kθ̂ − θk.

Since the true spectrum in the above radar application
contains only spectral lines, it does not belong to the
model class which the IS method produces. Our method
gives a rational approximation of the spectral line, but it
is difficult to quantify how good such an approximation
is due to the singularity of the true spectrum. Out of
such consideration, we want to test our method when the
generative model is rational. Consider the autoregressive
(AR) model
1
w(t),
(68)
x(t) =
1 − αz −1
where w(t) is a white noise with unit variance and α =
ρ eiθ is such that the modulus ρ is close to 1 and θ ∈
[−π, π]. It is well-known that in the scalar unidimensional case, the above AR model approximates the sinusoid in the sense that the AR spectrum has a peak
at frequency θ. A possible generalization of (68) in the
multidimensional case is

ference here is that the true signal is replaced with the
AR process defined by (69), in which we have chosen the
pole moduli ρ1 = ρ2 = ρ3 = 0.3. The variance σ 2 of the
additive noise in (70) is 2. The realization of the process x(t) is generated by applying the 3-d recursion (69)
given the noise and the zero boundary condition. Notice
that in order to reach the “steady state”, a realization of
size 10003 is generated recursively and only the last N
samples are retained for the covariance estimation. The
true spectrum Φ of the process (70) is given by

x(t) =

1
w(t)
1 − hα, z−1 i

Φ(eiω ) = Φx (eiω )R + σ 2 I2
which is certainly rational with
Φx (eiω ) =

y2 (t) = x(t) eiM θ3 + w2 (t)

(72)

the spectral density of the AR process (69). We are interested in how well the true spectrum Φ is approximated
by the IS estimator and the M2 periodograms. Let us
define the relative error kΦ̂ − Φk/kΦk where Φ̂ is one
of the spectrum estimates. These errors of the different
methods in 100 trials are reported in Fig. 5. The data
size N, the discrete torus T3N , the model order n and the
prior Ψ of the IS method, as well as the window widths
of the periodograms are the same as those in the previous part concerning sinusoidal signals. One can see that
the IS estimator clearly outperforms the periodograms.
Moreover, we also want to compare different methods
of spectral estimation in peak finding, namely how well
the estimators can locate the peak of the true spectrum
at θ. The errors kθ̂ − θk of the estimated peak location
θ̂ returned by different methods during the 100 trials
are depicted in Fig. 6. The three boxplots indicate that

where αj = ρj eiθj (j = 1, 2, 3) and hα, z−1 i := α1 z1−1 +
α2 z2−1 +α3 z3−1 are such that the sum ρ1 +ρ2 +ρ3 is close
to 1. The peak of the spectrum is of course obtained at
the vector θ := [θ1 , θ2 , θ3 ] of phase angles. We give next
the result of a Monte-Carlo simulation that contains 100
trials. In each trial, each component of the frequency
vector θ is generated from the uniform distribution in
[−π, π]. The signal model for the measurement is

Conclusions

In this paper, we have considered a M2 spectral estimation problem for periodic stationary random vector fields
via covariance extension, i.e., matching a finite number
of matrix covariance lags. Our solution is based on convex optimization with the Itakura-Saito distance which
incorporates an a priori spectral density as extra information. We have shown that the optimization problem
is well-posed, and thus a smooth parametrization of solutions can be obtained by changing the prior function.
Moreover, a covariance estimation scheme has been proposed given a finite-size realization of the random field,
and a spectrum estimation procedure using these estimated covariances is described. To illustrate the theory, we have performed numerical simulations concerning the parameter estimation problem in an automotive
radar system. The results show that our spectral estimator is very competitive with periodogram-based spectral
estimators. For practical applications however, efficient
methods need to be developed so that one can compute
IS estimators in real time, and this will be the subject
of further study. As another future research topic, we
plan to attack a spectral estimation problem similar to
(5) in which the spectrum is define on the continuum of
Td . Such a problem will no doubt be much more challenging, and careful analysis must be carried out on the
boundary of the feasible set.

PROOF. [Proof of Proposition 2] Let us first show that
f is of class C 1 . According to Lang (1999, Propositions

the quantity kΦ(Ψj , Qj )Ψ−1

For the partial derivative of f w.r.t. the second argument,
we have

exist and are continuous in D. The partials evaluated
at a point are viewed as linear operators between two
underlying vector spaces, and continuity is understood
with respect to norms.

(A.4)
One can show the continuity of the second partial in a
similar way to that for D1 fk .

To ease the notation, for (Ψ, Q) ∈ D let Φ(Ψ, Q) :=
(Ψ−1 + Q)−1 . Consider the partial derivative w.r.t. the
first argument

The same argument can be extended in a trivial manner
to prove the continuity of higher-order derivatives, because the expression of fk in (A.1) involves only rational
operations on its arguments (Ψ, Q).
