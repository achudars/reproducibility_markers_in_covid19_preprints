ABSTRACT
133P/Elst-Pizarro is the firstly recognized main-belt comet, but we still know little about its nucleus. Firstly
we use mid-infrared data of Spitzer-MIPS, Spitzer-IRS and WISE to estimate its effective diameter Deff = 3.9+0.4
−0.3
km, geometric albedo pv = 0.074 ± 0.013 and mean Bond albedo Aeff,B = 0.024 ± 0.004. The albedo is used to
compute 133P’s temperature distribution, which shows significant seasonal variation, especially polar regions,
ranging from ∼ 40 to ∼ 200 K. Based on current activity observations, the maximum water gas production rate
is estimated to be ∼ 1.4 × 1023 s−1 , being far weaker than ∼ 1026 s−1 of JFC 67P at similar helio-centric distance
∼ 2.7 AU, indicating a thick dust mantle on the surface to lower down the gas production rate. The diameter of
the sublimation area may be <∼ 200 m according to our model prediction. We thus propose that 133P’s activity
is more likely to be caused by sublimation of regional near-surface ice patch rather than homogeneous buried
ice layer. Such small near-surface ice patch might be exposed by one impact event, before which 133P may be
an extinct comet (or ice-rich asteroid) with ice layer buried below ∼40 m depth. The proposed ice patch may
be located somewhere within latitude −50 ∼ 50◦ by comparing theoretical variation of sublimation temperature
to the constraints from observations. The time scale to form such a thick dust mantle is estimated to be > 100
Myr, indicating that 133P may be more likely to be a relatively old planetesimals or a member of an old family
than a recently formed fragment of some young family.

1. INTRODUCTION

133P/Elst-Pizarro (hereafter 133P) was originally discovered as an asteroid-like point source with no special characteristics in the main belt by the Siding Spring 1.2-m telescope
on July 24, 1979, when it was at mean anomaly ∼ 15.3◦, thus
being named as asteroid 1979 OW7 (McNaught et al. 1996).
McNaught et al. (1996) also reported that this object was still
a point-source on September 15, 1985, when it was at mean
anomaly ∼ 48.4◦. Then on August 7, 1996, Eric W. Elst and
Guido Pizarro observed a main-belt object showing a long
narrow dust tail but no gas feature from the ESO 1-m Schmidt
telescope at La Silla Observatory. This special object looked
like a comet, and thus was designated as comet P/1996 N2,
which turned out to be the already discovered main-belt asteroid 1979 OW7. Subsequently the object obtained its current
name 133P/Elst-Pizarro.

The phenomenon that 133P suddenly showed comet-like
dust tail but no observable gas coma or gas tail is quite
strange for a main-belt object with the Tisserand parameter
T J = 3.18 > 3, because typical comets like Jupiter Family
Comets (JFCs) as well as Halley-family comets (HFCs) have
T J < 3. If the observation in 1979 and 1985 did tell us that
133P was inactive asteroid at that time, then the activity observed on August 7, 1996, when 133P was at mean anomaly
∼ 25.2◦ , seems to be triggered suddenly at some particular
time between 1985 and 1996. For instance, Toth (2000) proposed that the dust tail of 133P was caused by a recent impact
event, which could disturb the surface and generate ejection
of surface dust material.
Hsieh et al. (2004) reported the recurrent dust activity of
133P in its 2002 perihelion passage, which lasted at least
5 months from 2002 August to December based on observations by the UH 2.2-m telescope in 2002 and the Keck I
10-m telescope in 2003, the hypotheses of dust ejection by
one-time impact event to explain the appearance of 133P’s
comet-like tail in 1996 was thus ruled out. Hsieh et al. (2004)
considered a variety of mechanisms to explain the observed

Yu, Hsia & Ip et al.

comet-like behavior of 133P, but preferred to explain the dust
tail of 133P to be the result of seasonal sublimation of exposed surface ice, raising the interesting question about when
133P would be comet-like active and when it would be inactive along its orbit.
For this purpose, Hsieh et al. (2010) carried out a multiyear monitoring campaign of 133P from 2003 to 2008 (nearly
an orbital cycle of 133P), and again observed the return of its
activity in 2007. They found that 133P looks like an asteroid at most part of its orbit, but can also display dust tail
feature like a comet when it was close to or shortly after perihelion in 1996, 2002, and 2007. Moreover, the recurrence of
dust-tail activity of 133P near perihelion was also observed
on July 10, 2013 by the Hubble Space Telescope (Jewitt et al.
2014). Such significant seasonal variation and cyclical recurring activity strongly support the idea that the dust ejection
activity is caused by ice sublimation, and further imply that
there should even exist groups of icy small bodies in the main
belt, which led to the discovery of a new comet group, named
”Main-Belt Comet” (MBC, Hsieh & Jewitt 2006).
Hsieh et al. (2004, 2010) tended to explain the recurring
activity of 133P by seasonal sublimation of regional surface
icy patch, which may be exposed by impacts from deeply
buried icy layer. This model seemed to be perfect at that
time. However, following the discovery of more and more
main-belt comets, Hsieh et al. (2015) found that nearly all
of the known MBCs, appeared to show activity close to or
shortly after perihelion. If sublimation of regional surface
icy patch is responsible for these observed activity, there is no
reason to expect all the exposed icy patch on these MBCs to
get local summer close to or shortly after perihelion, because
impacts on the surface should be random events. Therefore,
Hsieh et al. (2015) proposed another possible mechanism.
That is variation of sublimate rate of homogenous buried icy
layer due to change of heliocentric distance may be the cause.
A new question thus arises on whether activities of MBCs are
caused by sublimation of regional surface ice patches or by
sublimation of homogenous buried ice layer?
On the other hand, the discovery of MBCs implies that water ice can survive in the main belt even today since their
formation. Details of the physical properties of the MBC
nuclei can give us key information about the formation and
evolution of the main belt, and hence provide clues about the
formation and evolution of the solar system. Clarification of
this issue would also shed light on the origin of water on terrestrial planets like our Earth. However, distances to MBCs
are too far away for current telescopes to figure out what happens on such MBC nuclei. So spacecraft mission to MBCs
would be necessary and meaningful. This is the reason why
133P becomes the target of a proposed ESA spacecraft mission named ’Castalia’ (Snodgrass et al. 2018), and it was also
selected to be a target of a proposed Chinese small-body mission. Thus theoretical modelling and constraints about the
thermal environment and thermal activity prior to the space
mission would be of significance for both the mission planning and instruments design.

In this paper, we aim to figure out the active mechanism
of 133P, and estimate its albedo, temperature and gas/dust
production rate. To realize these goals, firstly we use the radiometric method to infer the albedo and size of the nucleus
of 133P, then simulate the possible temperature variation of
the surface layers based on the estimated albedo and thermal
parameters. Finally dust-ice two-layer sublimation model of
buried ice is utilized to explain the current available observations on the activity of 133P, which enables us to depict
the possible distribution of ice on 133P and orientation of
133P’s rotation axis as well. The results show that the activity of 133P is more likely to be caused by the sublimation of
exposed regional near-surface ice patches than homogenous
buried icy layer.
2. RADIOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS

2.1. Thermal Infrared observations
2.1.1. Spitzer MIPS data
The Multiband Imaging Photometer on Spitzer (MIPS,
Rieke et al. 2004) observed 133P/Elst-Pizarro using 24 µm
channel at three different epochs on 2005 April 11 under
program 3119 (PI: W. T. Reach). The angular resolution
of the MIPS camera at 24 µm band was 2.5′′ with a field
of view (FOV) of ∼ 5.4′ × 5.4′ . The integrated fluxes for
24 µm channel are measured using the method described in
Hsia & Zhang (2014). The aperture calibrations of this MBC
at 24 µm vary in the adopted aperture radii. We have corrected the fluxes using the aperture- and color-calibration factors suggested by MIPS Instrument Handbook1.
The photometric uncertainties of these flux measurements
for 24 µm band are estimated to be from ∼ 7% to 9%. These
values of the uncertainties are derived from the absolute flux
calibrations and standard deviations of flux determinations
associated with our aperture photometry method. The data
are listed in Table 1.
2.1.2. Spitzer IRS Spectrum
The mid-infrared spectra of MBC 133P/Elst-Pizarro were
obtained by the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph (IRS; Houck et
al. 2004) through the observation program 88 (PI: D. Cruikshank) with Astronomical Observation Request (AOR) key
of 4870400. The data were all obtained on 2006 January 23.
The measurements were observed using the Short-Low (SL)
module (7.4 µm - 14.5 µm) and the Long-Low (LL) module
(14.0 µm - 38.0 µm) with spectral dispersions of R ∼ 60 130. The diaphragm sizes are 3.7′′ × 57′ and 10.5′′ × 168′ in
SL and LL modules respectively. The total integration times
of IRS observation ranged from 968 to 1220 s.
Data were reduced starting with basic calibrated data
(BCD) from the Spitzer Science Center’s pipeline version
s18.7.0 and were run through the IRSCLEAN program to
remove bad data points. Then the SMART analysis package
(Higdon et al. 2004) was used to extract the spectra. To im1

prove the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of IRS observations, the
final SL and LL spectra were performed using the combined
data. Since the IRS spectrum with short and long wavelength
ranges were observed at different epochs, some scaling is
needed for the shorter wavelength observations. We scaled
the IRS SL observations by a factor of 1.83 and were able to
obtain a smooth spectrum. The journal of IRS spectroscopic
observations is summarized in Table 1.
2.1.3. WISE data
The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mission
has mapped entire sky in four bands at 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22
µm with resolutions from 6.1′′ to 12′′ . All four bands were
imaged simultaneously, and the exposure times were 7.7 s in
3.4 and 4.6 µm and 8.8 s in 12 and 22 µm. Mid-infrared imaging observation of 133P was obtained from 12 µm band and
processed with initial calibration and reduction algorithm.
The aperture photometry for this object was performed
using the same method described in Hsia & Zhang (2014).
We adopted the color correction on the calibrated flux for
WISE 12 µm band using the color correction factor given by
Wright et al. (2010). To estimate the uncertainties in flux,
the standard deviations of background-subtracted flux measurements were adopted. If we take into account the characteristic uncertainty of flux measurement, the flux error is
estimated to be about 22% for 12 µm channel. Details of the
WISE infrared photometric results are also given in Table 1.
2.2. Albedo and size from NEATM
It is lucky that the thermal infrared observations above
were all taken when 133P was far away from its perihelion and did not show observable activity, thus it is safe for
us to use them as the thermal emission from the surface of
133P’s nucleus, which can be used to derive the albedo, size
and even thermal inertia of the nucleus. However, the orientation of 133P’s rotation axis is still unclear yet, so it is
not appropriate to use the so-called thermophysical model
(TPM, Lagerros 1996a) or advanced thermophysical model
(ATPM, Rozitis & Green 2011) to explain these data. Nevertheless, we can still estimate the albedo and size of the nu-

cleus from these data via the so-called Near-Earth Asteroid
Thermal Model (NEATM, Harris 1998).
The nucleus of 133P may have a irregular shape, but the
available data cannot resolve the shape in detail. So here, to
estimate the size of 133P, we define the effective diameter
Deff by treating it to be spherical. Then Deff can be related
to its geometric albedo pv and absolute visual magnitude Hv
via (Fowler & Chillemi 1992)
Deff =

1329 × 10−Hv /5
(km) .
√
pv

(1)

On the other hand, the Bond albedo Aeff,B can be related to
the geometric albedo pv by
Aeff,B = pv qph ,

(2)

where qph is the phase integral that can be approximated by
qph = 0.290 + 0.684G ,

(3)

in which G is the slope parameter in the H, G magnitude system of Bowell et al. (1989). The absolute visual magnitude
Hv and slope parameter G of 133P have been measured by
Hsieh et al. (2010) to be Hv = 15.49 ± 0.05, G = 0.04 ± 0.05,
which will be used in our fitting procedure.
The NEATM fitting results are presented in Figure 1,
which is a contour of the reduced χ2r with effective diameter Deff and beaming parameter η as two free parameters. The
1σ-level result is not that good, so we will adopt the 3σ-level
+0.3
results Deff = 3.9+0.4
−0.3 km, η = 1.35−0.2 . Then the geometric
albedo can be derived to be pv = 0.074 ± 0.013, and the bond
albedo can be obtained as Aeff,B = 0.024±0.004, which would
be useful for thermophysical modeling. To verify the results,
we plot the comparison between the Spitzer-IRS specta and
best-fit curve by NEATM in Figure 2. The best-fit curve by
NEATM matches well to the Spitzer-IRS spectra, indicating
that our radiometric results should be reliable. We summarize the radiometric results in Table 2.
3. TEMPERATURE CONSTRAINTS

4

Yu, Hsia & Ip et al.
Information about temperature environment of 133P is crucial for the design of instruments onboard the spacecraft, especially for the instruments on a lander. The temperature
distribution of a small body is largely decided by its rotation
and orbital motion. But unfortunately, the exact orientation
of 133P’s rotation axis is still unknown, due to the difficulty
of observation of light-curves when it is inactive. Nevertheless, the temperature environment can still be investigated by
considering various cases of orientations of the rotation axis.

Effective Diameter (km)

To begin with, we need a coordinate system to give descriptions of the rotation axis. For convenience, we introduce
two parameters — obliquity γ and azimuth ν, to define the
orientation of rotation axis with respect to the orbital plane
as shown in Figure 3.

1σ boundary (blue curve) corresponds to χ2 = 2.3, while the 3σ

Although the exact orientation of rotation axis of 133P is
not clear yet, Toth (2006) and Hsieh et al. (2010) have obtained constraints for the obliquity γ according to observed
light curves in 2002 and 2007. They found that obliquity
γ = 30 ± 10◦ can fit better to the observed light curves, but
the azimuth ν cannot be well constrained.

With an assumed value for the obliquity γ, the first thing
that we can do is to estimate the annual average temperature on each local latitude θ of 133P. To do this, we need
to assume infinite thermal inertia, and then the fast-rotating
or isothermal latitude model (Lebofsky & Spencer 1990) can
be applied. The annual average temperature T̃ (θ) of each latitude can be simply estimated as
(1 − Aeff,B )L̃s (θ) = εσT̃ (θ)4 ,

where Aeff,B is the bond albedo as estimated above, ε ∼ 0.9
is the average thermal emissivity, L̃s (θ) is the annual average

If the rotational parameter γ = 30 ± 10◦ , and with the
known orbital elements a = 3.16 AU, e = 0.1578 of 133P,
we are able to estimate the annual average temperature on
each local latitude, as shown in Figure 4. The annual average
temperature can be about 165 ∼ 170 K on the equator , and
be about 130 ∼ 155 K on the poles.

For more details, we refer the reader to Gundlach & Blum
(2013).
While the range of grain size of surface materials may be
different for various types of small bodies (especially inactive
asteroid), 133P is expected to be more cometary-like with a
dust mantle on the surface. The size frequency distribution
of dust on comets is generally described with a power law
formula f (b) ∼ b−3.5 , with minimum to maximum radius b
from 0.1 µm to ∼1000 µm (Rinaldi et al. 2017). Hsieh et al.
(2004); Hsieh & Jewitt (2006); Jewitt et al. (2014) inferred
that dust particles in the observed dust tail of 133P may be
mainly ∼ 10 µm in radius. So we may surmise that smaller
dust grains with radius from 0.1 µm to tens of µm might
have been depleted from most part of the surface (not include newly exposed surface). If removing dust grains < 50
µm, dust grains with radius in 100 ± 50 µm would have a

Annual Mean Temperature (K)

Figure 4. Estimated annual average temperature on each local latitude of 133P on the basis of obliquity γ = 30 ± 10◦ . The so-called
local latitude θ is defined as the the complementary angle of the
angle between the local normal vector and the rotation axis.

With the estimated mean temperature, we will then estimate thermal parameters of the surface dust layer (hereafter
named as dust mantle) of 133P, because thermal parameters
including thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity and
thermal inertia are all strong functions of temperature. According to Gundlach & Blum (2013), the thermal conductivity κ of the dust mantle on small bodies can be related to
temperature T , mean grain radius b and porosity φ via

of the total leftover dust grains. So we assume that the
mean radius of leftover dust grains on 133P’s surface may
be mainly 100 ± 50 µm.
Then if considering a annual mean temperature ∼ 160 K
and porosity φ ∼ 0.5 of the dust mantle, the mean thermal
conductivity of the dust mantle can be estimated from Equation (6) to be κ ∼ 1.2 × 10−3 Wm−1 K−1 . If further assuming
the mean grain density ρd ∼ 2000 kg m−3 and mean specific
heat capacity to be cp ∼ 500 Jkg−1 K−1 , the annual mean thermal inertia Γ of the surface could be estimated to be

Γ = (1 − φ)ρd cp κ ∼ 25 Jm−2 s−0.5 K−1 .
being close to the thermal inertia of comet nuclei, e.g. 67P
(Gulkis, Allen & Allmen et al. 2015). Besides, the mean
thermal diffusivity can be estimated as

and thus the seasonal thermal skin depth can be evaluated as

where Porb is the orbital period of 133P. Although the estimates of these thermophysical parameters are quite rough
approximations, they are still useful for further analysis on
the thermal behaviour of the nucleus of 133P.
3.3. Seasonal Temperature variation
As noted above, the assumed obliquity of γ ∼ 30◦ between
the rotation axis and normal vector of the orbital plane can
have significant influence on the variation of surface temperature along the orbit. We will show that the azimuth ν defined
in Figure 3 can also have significant influence on the seasonal
temperature variation.

Figure 5. Each panel represents seasonal variation of the diurnally averaged surface temperature as a function of local latitude under assumption
of different azimuth ν of the spin orientation but the same obliquity γ ∼ 30◦ . For different spin orientation, temperature on different latitude
will get maximum (summer) or minimum (winter) at different orbital position, as the result of seasonal effect.

Since the azimuth ν of 133P is still unclear yet, we consider
its value to vary from -180◦ to 180◦ with step 30◦ . The simulated results are presented in Figure 5. In each panel of Figure 5, the horizontal axis represents orbital mean anomaly,
the vertical axis is local latitude, and the color index stands
for diurnally averaged surface temperature. Each panel is
obtained under assumption of different azimuth ν of the spin
orientation but the same obliquity γ ∼ 30◦ .
According to Figure 5, we can clearly see that temperature
on each local latitude can reach maximum (summer) or minimum (winter) at different orbital position as a result of seasonal effect. Temperature on the poles can vary from ∼ 40 K
to ∼ 200 K. Such seasonal variation can cause similar variation of gas/dust production if there exist near-surface ice.
The distribution of ice on 133P can be investigated if we have
enough observations on the activity of 133P. In the following
section, we will present the available observations at present
on the activity of 133P, and what we can learn from these
observations.
4. ACTIVITY CONSTRAINTS

4.1. Available observations
Hsieh et al.
(2004,
2010);
Jewitt et al.
(2014);
Snodgrass et al. (2018) reported optical photometry of 133P
along its orbit, showing that activity of dust tail can appear
between Mean Anomaly ∼ −5.4◦ and ∼ 74◦ . Hsieh et al.
(2010); Jewitt et al. (2014) also measured the ratio of lightscattering area of dust Cd to that of nucleus Cn according
to the photometric images. In the above section, we have

computed the effective diameter Deff of 133P to be about 3.9
km. So if we assume that the dust particles in the tails have
similar albedo to that of the nucleus, and have an average
radius bd ∼ 10 µm (Hsieh et al. 2004), we could estimate the
total dust mass via
Mdust =

Cd
πρd bd D2eff ,

Cn

(7)

where ρd represents the mass density of dust particles. The
values of Cd /Cn and Mdust are listed in Table 3, and plotted
in Figure 6 as functions of orbital mean anomaly. The variation of the produced dust mass show significant seasonal
variation, which could provide us estimation on the dust production rate, and even constraints on the distribution of ice
on 133P.
4.2. Dust/gas production rate
The slope of the dust-mass variation curve in Figure 6
indicates the production rates of dust, which also varies
with the orbital position. We can infer that activity at least
starts at around mean anomaly −5.4◦ , where the slope of
dust mass indicates total dust production ∼ 0.0017 kgs−1 ,
and total water gas production rate 1.1 × 1022 s−1 if assuming dust-ice mass ratio ∼ 5 : 1 similar to that of 67P
(Fuller, Marzari & Corte et al. 2016). We also find that the
slop seems to get maximum at around 8 ± 3◦ , indicating that
133P may be most active during this time range with total
dust production rate ∼ 0.0215 kgs−1 , and total water gas production rate 1.4 × 1023 s−1 .

The estimation for the maximum water production rate
here is consistent with the upper limit of water production
rate <∼ 1024 s−1 given in Licandro et al. (2011). But such
water production rate is far weaker than that ∼ 1026 s−1 of a
typical JFC like 67P at similar helio-centric distance ∼ 2.7
AU (Hansen et al. 2016), indicating the existence of a dust
mantle on the surface, thus lowering down the gas production
rate. But the question about how and where the gas are produced from the nucleus of 133P, namely, whether the gas is
produced by sublimation from homogeneous buried ice layer
or only from regional near-surface ice patches, is still un-

If it is assumed that 133P has a homogeneous two-layer
system with a dust mantle covering a dust-ice mixture interior. The thickness of the dust mantle should be ∼ 50 to 150
m if 133P has stayed in the main belt over the entire lifetime of the Solar System according to Prialnik & Rosenberg
(2009). For such a two layer system, the ”two layer sublimation model” developed in Yu, Ip & Spohn (2019) can be
well applicable. But if 133P is a newly formed fragment
of a larger icy parent object, the ice layer can be closer to
the surface, and the dust mantle can be much thinner. The
question is how thin the dust mantle could be in the case
of a homogeneous distribution? If we expect the existence
of a stable dust mantle on 133P, the dust mantle thickness
is then expected to be several seasonal thermal skin depths,
like 2lsst ∼ 0.6 m. Then the ”two layer sublimation model”
(Yu, Ip & Spohn 2019) can still be a good approximation. If
adopting the obliquity of 133P to be about ±30◦ , then the
seasonal equilibrium subsurface temperature T̃ 0 and corresponding ice sublimation front temperature T i at each local
latitude can be estimated, as shown in left panel of Figure 7.
The right panel of Figure 7 presents model estimated water sublimation rate of the ice front below each local latitude
from 4 × 1012 m−2 s−1 to 3 × 1015 m−2 s−1 . The total water gas
production rate of such homogeneous case can be estimated
to be ∼ 1022−23 s−1 , which is quite close to the above estimated production rate from observation. Thus we may say
that the homogeneous case is reasonable if just considering
the total production rate <∼ 1023 s−1 .
However, in order to be able to eject dust particles, the drag
force of the outflow gas has to overcome the gravity force of
the dust particles

stands for gravitational acceleration at the surface of 133P. As
noted above, dust particles in the dust tail are mainly 10 µm
in radius (Hsieh et al. 2004, 2010), the outflow water flux is
hence required to be Js >∼ 5 × 1017 m−2 s−1 , indicating a
sublimation temperature T i >∼ 185K. So the maximum sublimation rate ∼ 3 × 1015 m−2 s−1 of the homogeneous case
shown in Figure 7 is too weak to drag away dust particles
with radius 10 µm from the nucleus surface of 133P, although
such homogeneous case can have similar total water production rate to the observation constraint.
On the other hand, from considering the maximum total
water gas production rate ∼ 1023 s−1 , and the requirement of
sublimation rate >∼ 5 × 1017 m−2 s−1 , we can estimate that
the sublimation area should be <∼ 3 × 105 m2 , corresponding
to a circular area with diameter <∼ 600 m, which is a small
region on the surface (nearly < 1/10 of the total surface of
133P). Therefore, we tend to believe that sublimation of homogeneous buried ice layer is unlikely to be responsible for
the observed activity, and instead regional near-surface ice
patch is necessary to explain the observations.
4.2.2. Regional near-surface ice patch?
So if we expect a near-surface ice patch to be the explanation of the observations, seasonal temperature variation of
the ice patch should be responsible for the observed seasonal variation of dust tail activity. The dust activity was
observed to start at around mean anomaly −5.4◦, indicating
sublimation temperature ∼ 180 ± 5 K at this orbital position. The estimated total water production rate at around

mean anomaly 8 ± 3◦ is nearly 10 times larger than that at
mean anomaly −5.4◦. If assuming the sublimation area of
the ice patch to be unchanged, the sublimation rate at mean
anomaly 8 ± 3◦ would also be 10 times larger, thus giving
Js >∼ 5 × 1018 m−2 s−1 , and the sublimation temperature to
be around 200 ± 10 K. Then the area of the near surface ice
patch can be estimated to be <∼ 3 × 104 m2 , corresponding
to a circular area with diameter <∼ 200 m, which is indeed a
small region on the surface of 133P. The results for the production rates and sublimation temperature are summarized in
Table 4.
If assuming that the possible ice patch is in the bottom of
one bowl-shaped crater, the diameter of the crater-rim has to
be on the order of ∼ 200 m. Such small crater can be created
from one impact event by an impactor with diameter ∼ 20 m
and impact velocity ∼ 10 km/s (Vincent et al. 2015). The estimated diameter of the crater-rim can further tell us that the
depth of the crater should be around ∼ 40 m according to the
nearly 5:1 ratio of crater-rim-diameter to crater-depth given
in Pike (1974). This scenario indicates that the internal ice
layer should be buried below ∼ 40 m depth from the surface
before the impact event. If 133P was initially composed of
a homogeneous mixture of dust and water ice, the time scale
to form a dust mantle with thickness hi ∼ 40 m in its current
orbit can be estimated as

is defined as the ’retreating rate’ of buried ice layer, in which
m̂ is the mass of water molecular, β̃ is the mean Knudsen
diffusion coefficient, nE is the saturation number density under the temperature T i of the buried sublimation front, and
χ0 ∼ 0.15 is the ice/dust mass ratio. For the current 133P
with a mean temperature T i <∼ 165 K of the buried sublimation front,
Rr <∼ 2.6 × 10−13 m2 s−1 ,
thus giving
tm >∼ 100 Myr.

Albedo, Temperature and Active Mechanism of 133P

4.3. Possible location of the exposed ice patch
Now the question of most interest is where the exposed
icy patch can be located on the surface? The significant seasonal variation of activity as shown in Figure 6 should be results of time variation of temperature of the near-surface ice
patch, thus giving constraints for the sublimation temperature
as shown in Table 4. Moreover, temperature on different local
latitudes can show different seasonal variations as the result
of some particular orientation of rotation axis with respect to
the orbit (as shown in Figure 5). This relation would provide
a way to investigate the possible location of the surface ice
patch and orientation of the rotation axis. We treat the location latitude LAi of the possible ice patch and the azimuth
ν of rotation-axis as two free parameters to fit the previously
obtained values for the sublimation rate and sublimation temperature in Table 4. The fitting results are presented in Figure
8.
Figure 8 shows the contour of reduced χ2 obtained by
fitting LAi and ν to sublimation temperature given in Table 4. The location of the lowest reduced χ2 indicates the
best fit to be LAi ∼ 20◦ and ν ∼ −130◦ . The cyan region stands for 1σ-level constraint for LAi and ν, giving
LAi = 10 ∼ 40◦ , ν = −160 ∼ −100◦ or LAi = −40 ∼ −10◦,
ν = 20 ∼ 80◦ . The yellow region means 3σ-level constraint,
giving LAi = −50 ∼ 50◦ only.
In terms of 3σ-level contour, the azimuth ν still cannot
be well constrained due to the lack of enough information
for seasonal variation of sublimation rate on 133P from observations. Nevertheless, we can at least infer the location
latitude LAi of the possible ice patch to be between latitude
−50 ∼ 50◦ , indicating that the possible ice patch is unlikely
to be located at high latitudes > 50◦ . If using the best-fit

Local Latitude (°)

Therefore, it can be expected that 133P has been in the mainbelt for a long time, with the ice layer deeply buried below
∼ 40 m depth in most regions. This time scale is much
larger than the proposed age ≤ 14 Myr (Carruba 2019) of the
young Beagle family that is thought to associate with 133P
(Nesvorný et al. 2008), indicating that 133P is more likely to
be a relatively old planetesimals or a member of an old family (e.g. Themis family) than a recently formed fragment of
a young asteroid family.
If it is assumed that the buried ice layer has similar dust/ice
mass ratio and dust size distribution as those of fresh JFCs,
then sublimation of the exposed ice patch can be active
enough to blow away ∼ 10 µm dust particles and hence
generate dust tails like the observations. During the early
tens of orbital cycles, the strong sublimation of the ice patch
can blow away most dust particle. A very thin dust mantle with thickness < 1 cm may form on the proposed ice
patch just like the surface layers of 67P. But such a thin
dust mantle would be unstable and can be repeatedly formed
and destroyed following the diurnal or orbital cycles, causing a moving boundary and hence preventing the formation
of a stable dust mantle until the accumulation of a sufficient
amount of large dust particles (> 2 cm) on the surface. In this
way, the current observation might be explained.

result LAi ∼ 20◦ and ν ∼ 130◦ as an example, we can simulate how the sublimation temperature, sublimation rate and
hence gas drag force, total water production rate of the nearsurface ice patch vary with orbital movement. The results are
presented in Figure 9.
Figure 9 clearly shows how the seasonal variation of sublimation temperature of a regional near-surface ice patch affects the sublimation rate of water and hence the ejection of
dust. In such a case, the ratio of gas drag force to gravity
force on 10µm dust particles will only be larger than 1 when
133P gets close to perihelion within a short time interval, thus
only producing dust tail during this period. But the total water gas production rate is too low to from an observable gas
coma and dust coma, which may be the reason why we only
observed long narrow dust tails behind 133P.
5. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

Although 133P is famous for being the first recognized
main-belt comet and has been discovered for ∼40 years, we
still know very little about physical properties of this object, which is rather disadvantageous if we need to plan
space mission to study it up-close. This paper therefore
aims to obtain estimates for the basic physical parameters
of 133P, including size, albedo, temperature and even activity mechanism. Firstly, by NEATM fitting to the data
from Spitzer-MIPS, Spitzer-IRS and WISE, we obtain estimates for the effective diameter Deff = 3.9+0.4
−0.3 km, geometric albedo pv = 0.074 ± 0.013 and mean Bond albedo
Aeff,B = 0.024±0.004. The derived diameter is close to the result of Hsieh, Jewitt & Fernández (2009), which used a similar NEATM procedure but only fitted the Spitzer-MIPS data
by assuming a beaming parameter η ∼ 1.0. The estimated pv
is closer to the result of Bagnulo et al. (2010), which utilized
a different method based on polarization measurement when

and total water production rate assuming a regional near-surface ice patch with diameter ∼ 200 m, locating at latitude ∼ 20◦ of the nucleus

critical value when 10 µm dust particles can be ejected.

133P was active. The advantages of our results in comparison to previous results of Hsieh, Jewitt & Fernández (2009)
and Bagnulo et al. (2010) mainly lie in two aspects: First,
the mid-infrared data were all obtained when 133P was far
away from perihelion and did not show observable activity,
these data are consequently thermal emission from the nucleus of 133P completely without pollution by dust activity; Second, the data cover three different epochs, namely
three different solar phase angles, making it possible to remove the degeneracy of diameter and beaming parameter in
the NEATM procedure, and hence simultaneously constrain
the diameter (albedo) and beaming parameter.
Of course, the method NEATM we use naturally bears disadvantages that the effects of thermal inertia and rotation axis
are not well resolved, which could influence the estimates for
size and albedo. However, currently the rotation axis of 133P
is unclear yet, making it difficult to use the so-called thermophysical model (TPM) to derive size, albedo and thermal
inertia simultaneously. In such a condition, the more reasonable way is: firstly using NEATM to compute size and
albedo, secondly using albedo to estimate mean temperature,
finally using mean temperature to estimate thermal parameters.
Actually, it is unavoidably that we still don’t know the rotation axis of 133P, because there are not enough light-curves
of 133P to do light-curve inversion procedure. Light-curve
observation of 133P is too difficult for small optical telescope
due to the far distance and small size of 133P, and it is quite
difficult to apply large telescopes to observe 133P. Thus we

need other ways to investigate the rotation axis of 133P. As
what we have done in this work, the seasonal variation of activity could provide us a way to investigate the rotation axis.
Since the production rate estimated from current observations is too low in comparison to that of typical JFC like 67P,
the activity of 133P is unlikely to be caused by sublimation
of homogeneous buried ice layer. We thus believe that the activity of 133P might have been generated by the sublimation
of a regional near-surface ice patch. The estimated diameter <∼ 200 m of the proposed ice patch can be generated
from one impact event by an impactor with diameter ∼ 20
m and impact velocity ∼ 10 km/s (Vincent et al. 2015). We
know that current 133P can show activity when it is at mean
anomaly −5.4◦ ∼ 74.1◦ . But before August 7, 1996, observations of 133P on July 24, 1979 (mean anomaly ∼ 15.3◦),
and on September 15, 1985 (mean anomaly ∼ 48.4◦ ) did not
show activity. Thus it is possible that the proposed ice patch
might have been exposed by one impact event during year
1985-1996.
The seasonal feature that dust activity only appears close
to or shortly after perihelion further supports the idea of regional ice patch. Then the location of the ice patch becomes
another unknown problem besides rotation axis, which together decide the seasonal variation of 133P’s activity, providing us a way to investigate the location of the ice patch
and the orientation of rotation axis. Based on current activity
observations, the 3σ-level constraint for the rotation axis is
not good yet, making the solution of ice-patch location nonunique as well. However, if we get sufficient observations

Albedo, Temperature and Active Mechanism of 133P
on the activity of 133P to describe the seasonal variation of
dust or gas production rate in future, we are sure that the
rotation axis of the nucleus as well as the location of the possible near-surface ice patch could be well approximated by
this way.
In conclusion, we find that the main-belt comet 133P is
largely different from typical JFCs, not only orbital features
but also distribution of ice in the nucleus. The current activity of 133P might be re-triggered by one impact event during year 1985-1996, before which 133P may be an extinct
comet (or ice-rich asteroid) with ice layer buried below ∼ 40
m depth from the surface. The time scale to form such a thick
dust mantle by sublimation loss of water is estimated to be
> 100 Myr, being much larger than the age of the young Beagle family, indicating that 133P is more likely to be formed
from an old family than a youn one, or probably a relatively
old planetesimals survived from the dawn of the solar sys-

11

tem. The proposed impact event may expose a regional nearsurface ice patch with diameter <∼ 200 m, probably locating somewhere between latitude −50 ∼ 50◦ . The seasonal
variation of temperature of the exposed ice patch will thus
generate the seasonal feature of activity as shown by current
observations.
