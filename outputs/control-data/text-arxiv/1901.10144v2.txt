We study analytically the dynamics of vortices in strongly coupled exciton–photon fields in the
presence of energy detuning. We derive equations for the vortex core velocity and mass, where they
mainly depend on Rabi coupling and the relative distance between the vortex cores in photon and
exciton fields, and as the result core positions oscillate in each field. We use Magnus force balanced
with a Rabi induced force to show that the core of the vortex behaves as an inertial-like particle.
Our analysis reveals that the core is lighter at periphery of the beam and therefore it is faster at
that region. While detuning induces oscillations in population imbalance of components through
relative phase between coupled fields, in the presence of topological charges detuning can control
the orbital dynamics of the cores. Namely, it brings the vortex core to move on larger or smaller
orbits with different velocities, and changes angular momentum and energy content of vortex field.

INTRODUCTION

The rotation of objects has always been an extremely
fascinating and challenging problem. Examples of angular motions are given in classical physics [1, 2] and
engineering [3]. When it comes to rotation in a fluid [4],
the term “vortex” is used to describe the peculiar motion around a central region. Vortices typically occur in
the wake of fluid motion where viscosity is the underlying physical mechanism. To quantify the rotation of a
fluid, one can introduce the concept of vorticity, defined
as the curl of the velocity field, and circulation, defined as
the contour integral of the tangential velocity component.
The latter concept is connected to the former (total vorticity) by Stokes’s theorem. In contrast to a conventional
fluid that can have arbitrary circulation, a Bose–Einstein
condensate (BEC) is constrained to carry quantized circulation. Such a property is on the other hand typical of a
complex–valued wavefunction, where the density profile
can include a depleted region surrounded by quantized
circulations. The flow in a condensate has the intrinsic
property of being inviscid, i.e., there is no viscosity to
bring the flow to a stop. Mathematically, a condensate
with a vortex is not simply-connected and then Stokes’
theorem does not apply. The idea of quantized vortices
was introduced for the first time with superfluid Helium,
and was then extended to other condensates. Quantized
vortices are now commonplace in superconductors [5], superfluids [6], atomic BECs [7], and polariton condensates
[8, 9]. Quantized vortices are recognized by a null density
region around which the phase wraps itself in quantized
units of 2π. Fields with such phase defect carry a quantized orbital angular momentum [10]. In this work, we
study vortices in two-component (exciton-photon) condensates, which leads to an interesting interplay for the
topology of the fields due to strong coupling (Rabi oscillations) on the one hand and the vorticity on the other
hand. Specifically, we will focus on the role of the energy
detuning between the exciton and photon components,
which is known to result in nontrivial dynamics [11, 12].
For such an investigation, microcavity polaritons [13]—
quasiparticles that arise from the strong coupling be-

tween microcavity photon and exciton quantum well—
are ideally suited (one could also consider spin-orbit coupled BEC [14, 15]). Polaritons have some interesting attributes. They have a very light effective mass (due to
their photonic component), they interact through their
excitonic component, and their photon and exciton components can also be easily detuned. The condensed phase
of polaritons was reported in 2006 [16] which has initiated an intense followup of fundamental research, including quantum hydrodynamics [17, 18], superfluidity
[8, 19], Josephson effects [20], and vortices [8, 21–24],
among others. The regime of strong coupling, typically
evidenced through the splitting between an upper and a
lower polariton branch in the dispersion relation, is more
notable for our purpose for the dynamics of Rabi oscillations between the photonic and excitonic components,
whose coherent control is now well implemented at the
femtosecond level with polaritons [25].
Even fields with no phase defects (vortices) exhibit peculiar dynamical effects in presence of an energy detuning between the components, such as oscillations in their
relative phase that result in oscillations in their population imbalance [11, 12]. A particular example is shown in
Fig. 1. Here, the population imbalance between the components is given by ρ ≡ (Nph − Nex )/(Nph + Nex ), with
Nph and Nex the population for the photon and exciton

fields respectively, being initially zero: Nph (0) = Nex (0).
For zero energy detuning, there is no oscillations in ρ,
although with the imbalance in the initial relative phase
of the components there would be oscillation in populations. However, by increasing or decreasing the detuning, some oscillations are triggered. With detuning, the
population imbalance takes a nonzero mean value, which
increases with detuning; it also changes the frequency of
oscillation.
In this work, we study analytically how the vortex dynamics gets affected by detuning in the regime of strong
coupling regime. We restrict our analysis to an ideal polariton gas in the Hamiltonian regime, where the Rabi
coupling is the predominant interaction that drives the
vortex core to move periodically. To describe the core
motion, we invoke a Magnus–like force [26, 27] that is
balanced by a force which originates from the Rabi coupling. This provides an expression for the inertial mass
of the vortex core, which changes in time and is of the
order of 10−15 kg and 10−12 kg, depending on the position of the core. Such a behavior is particular to a
polaritonic system, as its binary nature gives the core
a time-dependent attribute. Based on our analysis, we
demonstrate that the core behaves as an inertial particle, that is, it has a position, a velocity, and a mass.
Furthermore, we are dealing with a not–constant mass
case. We show that by changing the detuning, the core
moves faster or slower, which is the result of a particle
transfer between the two coupled fields; then detuning
addresses a controlling mechanism on the dynamics of
the core. Also, it controls the angular momentum of the
field.
The text is organized as follows: Section II presents the
relevant theoretical description of polariton BEC based
on its photonic and excitonic components. In section III,
we describe the oscillation of the core and how it is affected by detuning. In the following section IV, we focus
on the effect of detuning on quantum averages. Finally
we present concluding remarks in section V.

THEORY

The polariton in the exciton–photon basis is an example of a two–component Bose system. The equations of
motions for fields in binary Bose system can be conveniently described as quantized fields [28] with the following Hamiltonian:
~2 ~ 2
~2 ~ 2

|∇ϕ| + Eex ϕ† ϕ

(1)

Ĥ =

Here, the two first terms describe the free evolution of
the photon (ψ) and exciton (ϕ) fields, respectively; the
first term in the second line describes the Rabi coupling
between the photon and the exciton fields, which transfers excitations at the Rabi frequency Ω; the last term

accounts for self–interaction in the exciton field, with ~g
as the exciton–exciton interaction strength.

A.

Main Equations

Based on the Hamiltonian in Eq. (1), the dynamics of
2D interacting polaritons is described by a set of coupled
Schrödinger equation and Gross Pitaevskii equation for
the photon ψ and exciton ϕ fields, respectively:

Here, mex = (me + mh )m0 stands for the exciton mass
and mph ≈ nπ~/(clc ) = (n2 /c2 )(Ex + δ) is the effective
photon mass, with Eph ≈ ~cπ/(nlc ) where lc is the microcavity length. Eex is the exciton energy that is given
by Eex = 13.6 eV mµ0 n , where µ is the reduced effective
mass of the exciton and m0 is the bare electron mass. For
later calculations, we may need equations in a rescaled
form, then one can rescale the units of time and length
as t → tΩ, p
x → x/ξ, y → y/ξ, kx → kx ξ, and ky → ky ξ
where ξ ≡ ~/Ωmph .
Theoretical works [29] have estimated the selfinteraction strength as ~g u 6Ex a2B , where aB is the
exciton Bohr radius. Calculating ~g/(~2 /2mp ), with
mp ≈ 10−4 m0 as the polariton mass, one finds that polaritons are in the regime of weak interactions. However, experimental evidence [30, 31] has recently suggested that the interaction constant ~g could be of the
order of several meV µm, which puts polaritons in the
regime of strong self-interaction. In this work, we aim
at considering the effect of energy detuning on the dynamics of coupled fields with phase defects, with an emphasis on the role of the Rabi coupling as opposed to
polariton-polariton interactions. Such a regime of vortex
dynamics has been reported recently in Ref. [9], which
seems to justify the realm of a linear dynamics of coupled fields; therefore, hereafter, we ignore the effect of
self-interaction energy in our calculations.

(4b)
where zj (x, y, t) = x − xj (t) + i(y − yj (t)) with j = {c, x}.
Here, each field is normalized. The parameter w control the Gaussian spot size. It is worth mentioning that
one can consider coupled fields with different topological
charge in each, however, we found out that the initial
states (4) are the simplest choice to illustrate the physics
we want to discuss. Also, note that an initial condition
with a vortex in the photon field only does not develop
any dynamics for the vortex core.

Approximate Solution

There is no closed-form solution for Eq. (2) even in
the absence of a nonlinear term. However, one can find
approximate solutions through a series expansion, for example, by employing spectral methods [32] or homotopy
analysis methods [33]. In this text, we use a spectral
method, with the Hermite Hn (x) functions as basis functions; thus, we expand the wavefunctions ψ(x, y) and
ϕ(x, y) as:

ψ(x, y) =

These provide an infinite hierarchy of equations, coupled
by the Rabi and kinetic energy terms. One way to truncate this hierarchy is to note that for w2  ξ 2 , only
those an,m and bn,m that have nonzero initial values are
several orders larger than the other coefficients with zero
initial values; it is the case when w is of the order of
several micrometers, which is a typical estimate found in
experimental reports [9]. Then, we can approximate the
wavefunctions as:
ψ(x, y, t) u a00 (t)u00 + a1,0 u1,0 + a0,1 u0,1 ,
ϕ(x, y, t) u b00 (t)u00 + b1,0 u1,0 + b0,1 u0,1 .

Dynamics of the core

Examples of solutions for zero detuning are shown
in Fig. 2. The cores are initially located at (xc (0) =
−aw, yc (0) = 0) in the photon field and at xx (0) =
0, yx (0) = 0 in the exciton field. While they move periodically on their orbits, the background densities oscillate
similarly. Here, the fields are initially normalized and remain so in time. This implies that there is no particle exchange between the coupled fields, however, background
densities are oscillating while the core moves. The motion of the core is induced by the presence at a distance
of the other core, by the local density of the other field,
and by the Rabi coupling. The combined effect is that
the vortex core moves with a non-constant speed.
We now explain the dynamics based on our main equa-

4

FIG. 2. Oscillation of the core in the photon (upper panels) and in the exciton (lower panels) fields, shown for one period
of motion. The wavepacket is initially normalized to one and the energy detuning is zero, which implies no particle exchange
between the two fields, which remain normalized in time. Each fields carries a winding number of l = 1. The photon field is
initially deformed by displacing the core to a position far from the origin, while the core in the exciton field is located at the
origin. For the dynamics, the local density oscillates similarly. The core does not move with a constant speed. We also show the
stream lines of superfluid velocity for each field, as circles centered on the vortex core position. Here, we used: ~Ω = 2.75meV,
a = 1.2, w = 25µm.

tions. One notes that the core in each field never disappears completely, which implies that the solutions can
be written as the product of a background density and
a complex time-dependent function zj (t) = x − xj (t) +
i(y − yj (t)) for depleted points in the fields, as we have:
ψ = ρph (x, y, t)eiφph (x,y,t) zc (t) ,

(9a)

ϕ = ρex (x, y, t)eiφex (x,y,t) zx (t) .

(10b)

where ∆r = rc − rx gives the relative vector-position
of the cores, and Ŝ± = cos(φph − φex )î ± sin(φph −

φex )ĵ.These equations have the same mathematical form
even in the presence of self-interactions and external potentials, although with a potential the dynamics of the
cores take a different nature. Also, we note that there
are three factors that determine the variation of velocities in time; one factor depends on the distance between
the cores in each field which is followed by the Rabi frequency Ω. The other two factors depend on the gradient
of the local phase and density of each field; these two
factors come from the kinetic energy through a dependency on ~/mph,ex . Comparing ~/mc w and Ωw to approximate the order of the factors that define the cores
velocity, we assume, based on experimental evidences,
that Ω  ~/mc w2 , which implies that the Rabi–induced
velocity is the dominating factor for the motion of the
vortex core. For Ω = 0, each field turns to a free field,
and there is no motion of the core. In our case, there is
no external potential, and the motion of the core is mediated only by the interplay between the Rabi coupling
and the topology of the deformed field when a core is
displaced to a point far from the center of the field. As
the core is moving on a curved path, it has an angular

a core in the photon field, the x and y components of
this force have a linear dependency on xx , yx through
an equation like Ω(α1 (t)xx + α2 (t)yx ), while for a core
in the exciton field, it behaves like Ω(β1 (t)xc + β2 (t)yc ),
where αi and βi are some real coefficients depending on
the parameters of the system. On the other hand, there
would be a Magnus–like force that depends on the velocity of the vortex core. To find this, we multiply velocities
in Eqs. (10) from the left respectively by −2π~ρph k̂ and
−2π~ρex k̂, and we find:

with j = {c, x} and rj denoting the position vector of
the core in the photon (j = c) and in the exciton (j = x)
fields.
At this stage, we have shown that a core has both a linear and angular velocity, and its kinematic (description
of the motion itself with no reference to the underlying
forces) is thus transparent. To address the kinetics (descriptions of the causes of motions) of the core, however,
we also need to refer to the force that acts on it. In a
classical fluid, the circulation of a vortex can influence
any other vortex at a distance, which results in an effective force perpendicular to the velocity of the vortex
core[34]. Bringing this picture to a quantum fluid, it was
shown that such a force is connected to the gradient of
the total energy of the system for a BEC in an harmonic
trap[35, 36], and ambiguously for two unbounded coupled BECs[34] in the nonlinear regime. For polaritons
in the linear regime, one can show that the predominant
energy-scale in the system is the Rabi energy, defined as:
ER (xc , yc , xx , yx ) ≡ 2~ΩRehψ|ϕi ,

(12)

and this depends on the positions of the vortex cores.

and a gradient force FKin
j . The latter force has an
origin in quantum kinetic energy or zero point energy,
and is related to the quantum pressure. Examining the
orbital motion of the core, as it is shown in Fig. (2), one
can conclude that a possible force that makes the core
drift should depend on the relative distance between the
cores, as when xc (0) = xx (0) and yc (0) = xc (0) there is
no motion for the core. This implies that any effective
force FR related to the gradient of the Rabi energy does
not reproduce the expected dynamics of the vortex core
in our binary system.
Based on the above equations for the forces, we now
have a better understanding for an effective mass associated to the core. To this end, we note that the application of a force normal to the velocity direction does
change the linear momentum of an object, and the rate
of the change in momentum is equal to the applied force.
This implies that there would be a rotational acceleration
related to the cross product of the linear and angular velocities, which in the case of the core motion results in

FIG. 4. (a) and (b) show orbits for the core oscillations for different energy detuning between the photon and exciton fields.
The core in the photon field is shown as a yellow point, and
in the exciton field as a green point. In (a) and for positive
(negative) detuning, the core moves on smaller (larger) orbits, and its dynamical properties are different. It opposite
happens for the core in the exciton field. The amplitude of
velocity (|vc | and |vx |) are shown in (c) and (d). As the core
takes larger orbits, it speeds up even up to speeds larger than
the speed of light.

which depend explicitly on the angular velocity of the
cores. As there is no dependency on the Rabi frequency,
one can be hopeful that even in the presence of selfinteraction or external potentials, the equations for the
masses mc and mx will have the same mathematical form,
and that any effects associated with interactions and potential will be collected in angular frequencies of the cores
and ambient densities.
Now we have a complete description for the core dynamics with its position, velocity, mass and force associated to the core. In Fig. 3, we show examples of the
dynamical variables for zero detuning and for the photon field. The core is initially located at (−aw, 0), as
is indicated by the yellow point in Fig. 3(a). While the
core moves counter-clockwise, its speed |vc | decreases to
a minimum, when the core finds itself at the origin, and
then the core speeds up as it approaches to its initial position. With such a variation in its speed, the core decelerates in the first half of its motion and then accelerates in
the rest of its motion. The acceleration vector is pointed

toward a point C inside the orbit, while the Magnus force
is pointed in the opposite direction. This implies a negative mass for the core, which is shown in Fig. 3(b) for
one period of motion. The core is lighter when it take its
position at the periphery of the local density. Since in
our system, there is no external potential, such a variation in the inertial mass of the core originates exclusively
from the binary nature of the fields. Certainly, with the
presence of an external potential and/or self-interactions,
the core mass would behave differently, depending on the
interplay between the Rabi energy and the other energy
scales of the system.
Now we turn to consider the effect of the energy detuning. We first study the orbital motions of the cores
for different detunings, which are shown in Fig. 4(a) and
(b) for the photon and exciton fields, respectively. With
a nonzero detuning, the cores move on different orbits,
while for a zero detuning, they orbit on the same path.
Negative and positive detunings have different effects, as
the cores can move on smaller or larger orbits. Figures
4(c) and (d) show the corresponding amplitudes of velocities: |vc | and |vx |. As the detuning has opposite
effects in the photon and exciton fields, it decreases or increases the core speeds. It seems, as predicted in [9], that
the core speed could increase even to value larger than
the speed of light c = 3 × 102 µm ps−1 , and at the same
time, there would be a decrease of its mass. An angular
momentum (AM) polariton state |Ψi = α|ψilc + β|ϕilx ,
where |ψilc and |ϕilx , respectively, indicate photon and
exciton states with different topological charges lc and
lx , will propagate with a group velocity that depends
on the topology of the fields. One could expect that by
increasing and/or decreasing the detuning and equivalently manipulating the core speed, the group velocity
will increase or decrease correspondingly. This controlling over group velocity has practical importance in quantum memory[37].

ANGULAR MOMENTUM AND ENERGY
CONTENTS

A wavepacket with a phase defect that results in a rotation of the fluid around a vortex core, has a nonzero
value of angular momentum. Namely, the average angular momentum of the wavepacket Ψ is given by
Z
∂
hL̂z i = −i~ rdrdφhΨ| Ψi ,
(18)
∂φ
p
with r =
x2 + y 2 and φ = arg(x + iy) in polar
coordinates. For the initial wavepackets in Eqs. (4),
one can find hL̂z iph (t = 0) = ~w2 /(w2 + |zc |2 ), and
hL̂z iex (t = 0) = ~w2 /(w2 + |zx |2 ), respectively, for the
photon and exciton fields; then, with zc 6= zx , corresponding to placing the cores in different points in space,
there is a nonzero initial imbalance for the angular momentum ∆l ≡ hL̂z iph − hL̂z iex 6= 0. This also changes

FIG. 5. (a) shows the imbalance in angular momentum:
∆l = hLz iph − hLz iex . For positive detuning, the angular
momentum of the photon field is larger. We see variations
in the period of oscillations with detuning. It is shown for
δ = 3meV in purple, δ = 1meV in blue, δ = 0meV in green,
δ = −1meV in orange, and δ = −3meV in red. (b) The
mean value of the angular momentum for the photon (blue–
solid line) and exciton (red–dashed line) fields. For negative
detunings, the angular momentum is carried mostly by the
photon field. The mean value of the population imbalance is
also shown (in dark–thick solid line). In (c) we present the
variations of the Rabi energy in time for different detuning.
In (d) we show population imbalance.

the energy content of the coupled fields. To study this,
we first note that the kinetic energy is of the order of
~Ω/2w2 for the photon field and of (mph /mex )~Ω/2w2
for the exciton field; and that for w equal to several
ξ, these are at least two orders less than the Rabi energy which is proportional to ~Ω. This means that one
can neglect the kinetic energy for w in the range of several ξ. For zero detuning, the Rabi energy is a constant of motion and
pis given at t = 0 by ER (t = 0) =
2~Ω(w2 + rc · rx )/ (w2 + |zc |2 )(w2 + |zx |2 ). The configuration with rc = rx is unstable to a displacement
of the cores, since by increasing the distance between
the two cores, the energy of the system decreases correspondingly. One can deduce that states with cores at a
distance are more favorable than rc = rx , corresponding
to fields being at rest, and this decreasing in energy as
well as inducing the nonzero ∆l, will be realized through
the rotation of the vortex cores.
We now describe the time evolution of the energy and
angular momentum in Fig. 5 for some negative and positive detuning. One can see in Fig. 5(a) the time evolution of ∆l. There will be an exchange of the angular momentum between the components of the coupled
fields, which is periodic in time, as we expect from the

Rabi nature of the coupling. By placing the photon vortex core at a distance to the exciton vortex core, there
exists a nonzero (here, negative) initial imbalance in angular momentum, as the photon part has initially less
rotational content than the exciton part, and since the
total angular momentum should be constant, this imbalance triggers oscillations in the angular momentum.
Depending on the energy detuning, there will be oscillations with different periods and behaviors. First we see
that by increasing the detuning, there is a decrease in
the period of oscillations; then, we see that for positive
detuning, there will be longer time intervals with positive imbalance in angular momentum, i.e., the photon
field has more angular content in average. On the other
hand, with a negative detuning, there would be a state
with always ∆l < 0 in time, which implies that the rotational content of the photon field is always less than the
exciton field. In this case, the core will be faster in the
photon field, as it is being pushed to the periphery of the
beam, while the core in the exciton field is slower (see
Fig. 4). For an object with a positive mass, one expects
that increasing the angular momentum will make it go
faster, however, in the case of a vortex core, the opposite
happens. Actually, a core is an absence of matter, and
it has a negative mass, which results in it being pushed
toward regions of low density. It is shown in part (d)
in Fig 5, that for a negative detuning, the photon field
has more population, and indeed the field has a higher
density in the central region, which finally pushes the
core, with its negative mass, to the lower density region,
i.e., at the periphery of the wavepacket. In part (b), we
show the mean value of the angular momentum (right
y axis) and of the population imbalance (left y axis).
For positive detuning, the population is concentrated in
the exciton side and at the same time the photon field
has more angular momentum. The reverse happens for
negative detuning. One notes that, while the mean value
of the population imbalance is symmetric with respect to
detuning variations, it is not the case for the angular momentum. It makes the negative detuning a special case
for the dynamics of the vortex core. Indeed, if we imagine rc = (−aw, 0)√and rx = (0,√0), one can show that for
δ ≈ −~Ω(a2 w2 + 1 + a2 )/w2 1 + a2 , there is no evolution of the angular momentum in time, i.e., ∆l = cons..
The total energy of the system ET ≈ ER (t)+δNph (t) also
changes with detuning, although it is a constant of motion, i.e., it does not change with time. Increasing |∆r|
and applying detuning, one can set the energy of the system to a desired value. We present the time evolution
of the Rabi energy in part (c). Here, as we mentioned
before, there is no oscillation in time for zero detuning,
due to the zero imbalance in population and the normalization of the wavepackets. Nonzero detuning will
however induce oscillations of the Rabi energy. To understand this, we first note that ∂t ER ∝ −δImhψ|ϕi and
∂t Imhψ|ϕi ∝ δER ; then as ER (t = 0) is nonzero, and any
nonzero detuning will affect hψ|ϕi, and therefore there
is an oscillation in the relative phase arg[hψ|ϕi], which

8
drives the population imbalance; hence, a nonzero detuning induces self-trapping for both the population and
the angular content of the coupled fields.

V.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, we have studied the dynamics of vortices in coupled exciton–photon fields, where the binary
nature of the coupling fields sets the vortex cores in motion. We found out that the vortex core behaves like
particles that can be described by their position, velocity
and mass. We identified the later based on the Magnus
force. Then, we showed the effect of energy detuning to
control the dynamics of the vortex core. This provides a
control over both the kinematic (positions & velocities)
and kinetics (energy & angular momentum) of the field
plus the core positioned in the field. This control over the
vortex dynamics, that is special for polaritonic system,
can have applications in many fields related to angular
momentum in matter and light, in particular, for memory
reading and writing [37–39] and information processing
with angular momentum[40]. It also could be used for
manipulating and maintaining vortices in superconductor phases[5, 41].

We mentioned in the main text that the equations of
motions for an,m and bn,m provide a general hierarchy.
To solve such systems of ordinary equations, one needs
to truncate them based on some criterion. We found that
when w is several orders larger than ξ, we can approximate the solutions by keeping those terms that are initially nonzero, while removing other terms due to their
small values. Our initial conditions in subsection II B
give the following values for nonzero coefficients in t = 0:
