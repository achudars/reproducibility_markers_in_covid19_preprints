Abstract. Let H be a complex, separable Hilbert space, and B(H) denote the set of
all bounded linear operators on H. Given
projection P ∈ B(H) and an

relative to the decomposition H =
operator D ∈ B(H), we may write D =

ran P ⊕ ran (I − P ). In this paper we study the question: for which non-negative integers
j, k can we find a normal operator D and an orthogonal projection P such that rank D2 = j
and rank D3 = k? Complete results are obtained in the case where dim H < ∞, and partial
results are obtained in the infinite-dimensional setting.

1. Introduction
1.1. Let H denote a complex, separable Hilbert space. By B(H) we denote the space of
bounded linear operators acting on H, keeping in mind that when dim H = n < ∞ we may
identify H with Cn , and B(H) with Mn (C). We write P(H) := {P ∈ B(H) : P = P 2 = P ∗ }
to denote the set of orthogonal projections in B(H). Given T ∈ B(H), T admits a natural

with respect to the decomposition H = P H ⊕ (I − P )H. Of course, Tj = Tj (P ), 1 ≤ j ≤ 4.
We are interested in determining to what extent the set {(T2 (P ), T3 (P )) : P ∈ P(H)}
determines the structure of the operator T . Following [4], we say that T has property
(CR) (the common rank property) if rank T2 (P ) = rank T3 (P ) for all P ∈ P(H). We
recall that an operator A ∈ B(H) is said to be orthogonally reductive if P ∈ P(H) and
(I − P )AP = 0 implies that P A(I − P ) = 0. That is, every invariant subspace for A is
orthogonally reducing for A. In the above-cited paper, the following result was obtained:
1.2. Theorem. [4, Theorem 5.8] Let H be a complex Hilbert space and T ∈ B(H). If T
has property (CR), then there exist λ, µ ∈ C and A ∈ B(H) with A either selfadjoint or an
orthogonally reductive unitary operator such that T = λA + µI.
1.3. In fact, if dim H < ∞, then the converse is also true ([4, Theorem 3.15]). We note that
every normal operator (and hence every unitary operator) acting on a finite-dimensional
Hilbert space is automatically orthogonally reductive. In particular, every operator T that

has property (CR) must be normal with spectrum lying either on a line or a circle, and
when H is finite-dimensional, every such normal operator has property (CR).
Property (CR) was termed a “compatibility” condition on the off-diagonal corners of the
operator T . In this paper, we examine to what extent the off-diagonal corners of a normal

D1 D2
operator D may be “incompatible” in the sense of rank. That is, writing D =
D3 D4
relative to H = P H ⊕ (I − P )H, we consider how large
|rank D2 − rank D3 |

can get.
More generally, our main result (Theorem 2.5 below) shows that if dim H = n < ∞
and 1 ≤ j, k ≤ ⌊ n2 ⌋, then there exist a normal operator D and a projection P such that
rank D2 (P ) = j while rank D3 (P ) = k. If dim H = ∞ and if 0 ≤ j, k ≤ ∞, then the same
conclusion holds (Theorem 3.2).
The infinite-dimensional setting also allows for certain subtleties which
cannot

 occur in
D1 D2
the finite-dimensional setting. For example, if dim H = n < ∞, D =
∈ B(H) is
D3 D4
normal and D3 = 0, then D2 = 0. Indeed, this is just a restatement of the fact that every
normal matrix is orthogonally reductive. This follows by observing that the normality of
D implies that
D1∗ D1 − D1 D1∗ = D2 D2∗ − D3∗ D3 .
Thus tr(D2 D2∗ ) = tr(D3∗ D3 ), or equivalently kD2 k2 = kD3 k2 , where k · k2 refers to the
Frobenius (or Hilbert-Schmidt) norm. From this, D3 = 0 clearly implies that D2 = 0. We
shall show that if H is infinite-dimensional, then it is possible to have D3 (P ) = 0 while
D2 (P ) is a quasiaffinity (i.e. D2 (P ) has trivial kernel and dense range), although it is not
possible for D3 (P ) to be compact and D2 (P ) to be invertible (see Proposition 3.3 below).
1.4. It is worth mentioning that a related question where ranks are replaced by unitarily
invariant norms has been
 considered
 by Bhatia and Choi [2]. More specifically, they consider
D1 D2
normal matrices D =
acting on H := Cn ⊕ Cn . As noted above, normality of
D3 D4
D shows√that kD2 k2 = kD3 k2 . In the case of the operator norm k · k, it follows that
kD3 k ≤ n kD2 k, and equality can be obtained in this expression if and only if n ≤ 3. (If
we denote by αn the minimum
number such that kD3 k ≤ αn kD2 k for all D ∈ M2n (C) as
√
above – so that αn ≤ n – it is not even known at this time whether or not the sequence
(αn )n is bounded.
√
It is interesting to note that the example they give for the case where n = 3 and α3 = 3
is also an example of a normal matrix D ∈ M6 (C) for which rank D2 = 1 and rank D3 = 3.
2. The finite-dimensional setting
2.1. In examining the incompatibility of the off-diagonal corners of a normal operator
D ∈ Mn (C), we first dispense with the trivial cases where n ∈ {2, 3}. Indeed, as seen in
Proposition 3.7 of [4], in this setting, D automatically has property (CR).
For this reason, henceforth we shall assume that dim H ≥ 4.
The key to obtaining the main theorem of this section is Theorem 2.3, which shows
that if dim H = 2m for some integer m ≥ 2, then we can find a normal operator D
such that rank D3 = 1 and rank D2 = m. For m = 2, this is an immediate consequence

3

of Theorem 3.15 of [4], since in this case, given a normal operator D ∈ M4 (C) whose
eigenvalues do not lie either on a common circle or a common line, D fails to have property
(CR), and this can only happen if there exists a projection P ∈ M4 (C) of rank two such
that rank D2 (P ) = 2, while rank D3 (P ) = 1.
Given X = [xi,j ], Y = [yi,j ] ∈ Mn (C), we shall denote by X • Y the Hadamard or Schur
product of X and Y ; i.e. X • Y = [xi,j yi,j ] ∈ Mn (C).

S can be expressed in the form S = M N −1 , where M and N are two commuting positive
definite matrices satisfying M 2 + N 2 = Im . From this it follows that

Suppose, therefore, that m ≥ 3. By Lemma 2.2, we have reduced our problem to that of
finding two diagonal matrices A = diag(α1 , α2 , . . . , αm ) and B = diag(β1 , β2 , . . . , βm ), and
a positive definite matrix 0 < S = [sj,k ] ∈ Mm (C) such that

rank S • Z = 1

and

rank S t • Z = m.

We begin by specifying A and B; we first temporarily fix a parameter 1 < γ whose exact
value we shall determine later. For 1 ≤ j ≤ m, set αj = jγ + i. Set B = A∗ , so that
βk = αk = kγ − i. Then Z = [zj,k ] = [(j − k)γ + 2i].
2i
Next, we set S(= S(γ)) = [sj,k ], where sj,k =

(j − k)γ + 2i
1 ≤ j, k ≤ m,
2i

sk,j =

(j − k)γ + 2i

so that S is clearly hermitian, and sj,j = 1 for all 1 ≤ j ≤ m. It is therefore reasonably
2i
straightforward to see that since m is a fixed constant, and since lim

γ→∞ (j − k)γ + 2i
for all 1 ≤ j 6= k ≤ m, there exists a constant Γ(m) ≥ 1 such that γ > Γ(m) ensures that
kS − Im k < 14 , and thus S(= S(γ)) must be positive definite.
For an explicit estimate for Γ(m), we may observe that if R = [rj,k ] ∈ Mm (C), and if
m
kRk∞ := max{|rj,k | : 1 ≤ j, k ≤ m}, then kRk ≤ mkRk∞ . Indeed, if x = (xk )m
k=1 ∈ C ,
then (using the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality) we find that

and so S is a positive invertible operator.
Consider
S • Z = [sj,k zj,k ] = [

2i
((j − k)γ + 2i)] = [2i]m×m .
(j − k)γ + 2i

It is clear that S • Z ∈ Mm (C) is a rank-one operator; indeed, S • Z = 2miQ, where Q
1
is the rank-one projection whose matrix consists entirely of the entries m
.
We therefore turn our attention to
S t • Z = [sk,j zj,k ] = [

2i
((j − k)γ + 2i)] = [2iθj,k ],
(k − j)γ + 2i

(j − k)γ + 2i
∈ T, 1 ≤ j, k ≤ m. Observe that if 1 ≤ j, k ≤ m − 1, then
(k − j)γ + 2i
1
θj,k = θj+1,k+1 . Thus T := 2i
(S t • Z) is a Toeplitz matrix, and the diagonal entries of T
are all equal to 1.
In fact, for 1 ≤ j, k ≤ m,

where θj,k =

θk,j =

−((j − k)γ + 2i)
(k − j)γ − 2i
=

(j − k)γ − 2i
−((k − j)γ + 2i)

and therefore T is not only Toeplitz, but hermitian as well.
There remains only to show that the rank of S t • Z is m, or equivalently, that det T 6= 0.

Define T̂ = 2Im − mQ. Then T̂ is invertible and T̂ −1 = 2−m
Q + 21 (Im − Q). Note
that each diagonal entry of T̂ is 1, while each off-diagonal entry is −1. From this and the
calculations above it follows that

implying that T is invertible, whenever γ > Γ(m) = 8m.
Thus, by choosing γ > Γ(m) = 8m, we see that a positive solution to our problem can
be found.
✷
2.4. Suppose now that n ≥ 5 is an integer and that T ∈ Mn (C). If P ∈ P(Cn ) is any
projection, then the minimum of rank P and rank (I − P ) is at most ⌊ n2 ⌋. It follows that
n
max(rank T2 (P ), rank T3 (P )) ≤ ⌊ ⌋.
2
As already observed, if D ∈ Mn (C) is normal, then D is orthogonally reductive, and so if
rank T3 (P ) = 0, then automatically rank T2 (P ) = 0. In light of these observations, we see
that the following result is the best possible, and it is the main theorem of this section.

2.5. Theorem. Let n ≥ 2 be a positive integer, 1 ≤ j, k ≤ ⌊ n2 ⌋. Then there exist a normal
operator D ∈ Mn (C) and a projection P such that relative to Cn = ran P ⊕ ran (I − P ), we
can write

where rank D2 = k and rank D3 = j.
Proof. Without loss of generality, we can assume that k ≥ j. First, we set m := (k − j) + 1.

✷
2.6. The operator D constructed in Theorem 2.5 is far from unique. Indeed, we first note
that we were free to choose arbitrarily large γ’s in the definition of A and B defined above.
Secondly, it is not hard to show that by choosing B = A∗ and Z as we did above, and by
defining S such that S • Z = 2iQ, S is always hermitian. Thus, given one triple (A, B, S) as
above that works, if we slightly perturb the weights αj of our given A to obtain a diagonal
matrix A0 and we set B0 = A∗0 , then the new S0 we require to make S0 • Z0 = 2iQ will be
sufficiently close to the original S so as to be invertible (since the set of invertible operators
is open in Mm (C)).
2.7. An interesting, but apparently far more complicated question, is to characterise those
normal operators D ∈ M2m (C) for which it is possible to find a projection P of rank equal
to m such that rank (I − P )DP = 1 and rank P D(I − P ) = m. We are not able to resolve
this question at this time. We can assert, however, that not only is such a normal operator
abstractly “far away” from operators with property (CR); in fact, we are able to quantify
this distance, and say a bit more about the structure of D.
Let n ≥ 1 be an integer, and recall that the function
ρ : Mn (C) × Mn (C) → {0, 1, 2, . . .}
(A, B)
7→ rank (A − B)

defines a metric on Mn (C).

7

We also recall that an operator T ∈ B(H) (where dim H ∈ N ∪ {∞}) is said to be cyclic
if there exists x ∈ H such that span {x, T x, T 2 x, . . .} is dense in H. Obviously this can
only happen if H is separable, and it is well-known that a normal operator is cyclic if and
only if it has multiplicity one; that is, its commutant N ′ := {X ∈ B(H) : XN = N X}
is a masa (i.e. a maximal abelian selfadjoint subalgebra of B(H)). If N is a compact,
normal operator, then this is equivalent to saying that the eigenspaces corresponding to the
eigenvalues of N are all one-dimensional, and together they densely span the Hilbert space.
2.8. Theorem. Let m ≥ 3 be an integer, and suppose that D ∈ M2m (C) is a normal
operator. Suppose that P ∈ M2m (C) is an orthogonal projection of rank m and that D ∈
M2m (C) is a normal operator for which rank (I − P )DP = 1 and rank P D(I − P ) = m.
Then
(a) D has 2m distinct eigenvalues (and therefore D is a cyclic operator); and
(b) ρ(D, Y ) ≥ ⌊ m−1
2 ⌋ for all Y ∈ Y, where Y is the set of matrices in M2m (C) which
satisfy property (CR).
Proof. First observe that we may assume without loss of generality that D is invertible,
since otherwise we simply add a sufficiently large multiple of the identity to D, which affects
neither the hypotheses nor the conclusion of the Theorem.
(a) Next, we set P0 := P , and let V0 be the range of P0 . By hypothesis,
dim(V0 ∨ DV0 ) = m + 1, dim(V0 ∩ D −1 V0 ) = m − 1.
More generally, we claim that the following chain of subspaces has strictly increasing dimensions (from 0 to n = 2m):
where
and

V−m ⊂ V−m+1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ V−1 ⊂ V0 ⊂ V1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Vm ,
Vk+1 = Vk ∨ DVk , ∀ 0 ≤ k ≤ m − 1,
Vk−1 = Vk ∩ D −1 Vk , ∀ − m + 1 ≤ k ≤ 0.

Assume to the contrary that this fails. Let Pk be the projection to the range of
Vk , −m ≤ k ≤ m.
(i) If Vk+1 = Vk for some 0 < k < m, then DVk = Vk . This implies that D ∗ Vk = Vk ,
i.e., that Pk D(I − Pk ) = 0. Since Pk ≥ P0 , we deduce that
P0 D(I − Pk ) = 0,

(rank(Pk ) = dim(Vk ) ≤ m + k < 2m). In other words, P0 D(I − P0 ) has
nontrivial kernel in V0 , a contradiction.
(ii) Similarly, if Vk+1 = Vk for some −m ≤ k < 0, then once again DVk = Vk and
Pk D(I − Pk ) = 0. Since Pk ≤ P0 , we deduce that
Pk D(I − P0 ) = 0.

(rank(Pk ) = dim(Vk+1 ) = dim(Vk ) ≥ 1.) This implies that the range P0 D(I −
P0 ) is smaller that that of P0 ; a contradiction.
Thus the claim is proved.
In particular, V−m+1 is one-dimensional. Pick a unit vector in V−m+1 . We next
show that x is a cyclic vector for D.
Note that Dx ∈
/ V−m+1 , and hence x, Dx span V−m+2 . Under the assumption that
{x, Dx, · · · , D j x} spans V−m+j+1 , we see that {x, Dx, · · · , D j+1 x} spans V−m+j+2

8

by construction. This is true for all 0 ≤ j ≤ 2m − 1, which proves that x is a cyclic
vector of D.
(b) With the decomposition of C2m = ranP ⊕ ran(I − P ), we may write


D1 D2

Next, suppose that Y ∈ Y, so that Y has the common rank property. With respect
to the same decomposition of C2m , we have that

Clearly D2 = Y2 + F2 and D3 = Y3 + F3 . Denote by r the rank of F . Then
m = rank D2 ≤ rank Y2 + rank F2 ≤ rank Y2 + r,
and similarly
rank Y3 ≤ rank D3 + rank F3 ≤ r + 1.
But rank Y2 = rank Y3 , since Y has the common rank property, and so it follows
that
and thus r ≥ ⌊ m−1
2 ⌋. Hence,

m ≤ r + r + 1,

ρ(D, Y ) ≥ ⌊

m−1
⌋.

✷

2.9. An inspection of the proof of part (b) of the above theorem shows that the finitedimensionality of the underlying Hilbert space did not really play a role. In fact, if H is
infinite-dimensional, 0 ≤ j, k < ∞, D ∈ B(H) is normal and P ∈ B(H) is a projection for
which
rank (I − P )DP = j

and

rank P D(I − P ) = k,

then the same argument shows that rank(D − Y ) ≥ ⌊ |k−j|
2 ⌋ for all operators Y ∈ B(H) with
the (CR) property.

3. The infinite-dimensional case
3.1. Throughout this section, we shall assume that the underlying Hilbert space H is
infinite-dimensional and separable. Our first goal in this section is to extend Theorem 2.5
to this setting.

9

3.2. Theorem. For all 0 ≤ j, k ≤ ∞, there exist a normal operator D ∈ B(H) and an
orthogonal projection P ∈ B(H) for which
rank (I − P )DP = j

and

rank P D(I − P ) = k.

Proof. By replacing P by I − P if necessary, it becomes clear that there is no loss of
generality in assuming that j ≤ k.
Case One: j = 0.
If k = 0 as well, we may consider D = I, the identity operator, and let P be any non-zero
projection.
For k = 1, we consider the bilateral shift U : that is, let {en }∞
n=1 be an orthonormal basis
for H, and set U en = en−1 for all n ∈ Z. Let P0 denote the orthogonal projection of H onto
span {en }n≤0 . The condition above is satisfied with D := U , P = P0 .
For 2 ≤ k ≤ ∞, we simply consider the tensor product D := U ⊗ Ik of U above with Ik ,
the identity operator acting on a Hilbert space K of dimension k, and we set P = P0 ⊗ Ik
to obtain the desired rank equalities.
Case Two: 1 ≤ j < ∞.
Let U denote the bilateral shift from Case One, and P0 denote the orthogonal projection
of H onto span {en }n≤0 . If H := (U + U ∗ ) ⊗ Ij , it is relatively straightforward to verify that
with Q1 := P0 ⊗ Ij , we have that
rank (I − Q1 )HQ1 = j = rank Q1 H(I − Q1 ).
Next, let R = U ⊗ Ik−j (where ∞ − j := ∞) and choose a projection Q2 = P0 ⊗ Ik−j as in
Case One such that
rank (I − Q2 )RQ2 = 0

and

rank Q2 R(I − Q2 ) = k − j.

A routine calculation shows that with D := H ⊕ R and P := Q1 ⊕ Q2 , the desired rank
equalities are met.
Case Three: j = ∞.
Since we have reduced the problem to the case where j ≤ k, it follows that k = ∞ as
well.

Consider the selfadjoint operator Ĥ =

✷
The case where j = 1 and k = ∞ in the above Theorem is only one possible infinitedimensional analogue of Theorem 2.3. Alternatively, we may view that Theorem as requiring that D2 be invertible. Interestingly enough, this is no longer possible in the infinitedimensional setting. In fact, a stronger (negative) result holds.
3.3.

Proposition. There does not exist a normal operator

in B(H ⊕ H) such that D2 is invertible and D3 is compact.

10

Proof. We argue by contradiction. If such normal operator D were to exist, it would follow
that
D2 D2∗ = (D1∗ D1 − D1 D1∗ ) + D3∗ D3 .

Since D2 is invertible, D2 D2∗ is positive and invertible, and thus 0 is not in the essential numerical range of D2 D2∗ . On the other hand, by a result of the second author [6, Theorem 8],
and keeping in mind that D3 is compact, 0 is indeed in the essential numerical range of
(D1∗ D1 − D1 D1∗ ) + D3∗ D3 , a contradiction.
✷

3.4. When 1 ≤ m < ∞, it is clear that an operator D2 ∈ Mm (C) is invertible if and
only if D2 is a quasiaffinity; i.e. it is injective and has dense range. Moreover, in the
infinite-dimensional setting, not every normal operator is orthogonally reductive. Despite
this, in light of Proposition 3.3, the next example is somewhat surprising.
3.5.

Theorem. There exists a normal operator

in B(H ⊕ H) such that D2 is a quasiaffinity.
Proof. Let A = U + 2U ∗ and B = A∗ = U ∗ + 2U , where U is the bilateral shift operator
(i.e. U en = en−1 , n ∈ Z) from Theorem 3.2. Then D := A ⊕ B is easily seen to be a normal
operator.
Let M ∈ B(H) be a positive contraction, and let N := (I − M 2 )1/2 , so that M N = N M
and M 2 + N 2 = I. From this it follows that

that N = (I − M 2 )1/2 implies that N = diag(βn )n∈Z , where βn = √

It is easy to see that M and N are commutative, positive contractions and M 2 + N 2 = I
by construction.

Next,
N AM en = N A(αn en )
= αn N (en−1 + 2en+1 )
= αn (βn−1 en−1 + 2βn+1 en+1 ),
while
M A∗ N en = M A∗ (βn en )
= βn M (en+1 + 2en−1 )
= βn (αn+1 en+1 + 2αn−1 en−1 ).
But

Since this holds for all n ∈ Z, N AM − M A∗ N = 0, as claimed.
As for the second equation we must verify, observe that
2αn βn+1 = √

(M AN − N A∗ M )∗ = N A∗ M − M AN = −(M AN − N A∗ M ).

As such, we need only show that M AN − N A∗ M is injective, since then (M AN − N A∗ M )∗
is also injective and thus both are injective and have dense range.
Again, we compute, for each n ∈ Z,
(M AN − N A∗ M )en = M AN en − N A∗ M en

= M A(βn en ) − N A∗ (αn en )

= βn M (en−1 + 2en+1 ) − αn N (en+1 + 2en−1 )

= βn (αn−1 en−1 + 2αn+1 en+1 ) − αn (βn+1 en+1 + 2βn−1 en−1 )

By equating coefficients, we see that for all p ∈ Z,
or equivalently,

xp+1 (αp βp+1 − 2αp+1 βp ) + xp−1 (2αp βp−1 − αp−1 βp ) = 0,

2αp βp−1 − αp−1 βp

for all p ∈ Z.
αp βp+1 − 2αp+1 βp
But a routine calculation shows that

αp βp+1 − 2αp+1 βp

and so the condition that kxk2 =

Thus ker (M AN − N A∗ M ) = 0 = ker (M AN − N A∗ M )∗ , as required to complete the proof.
✷
Using a slightly more subtle “direct sum” device than in Case Two of Theorem 3.2, we
obtain:
3.6. Corollary. If 1 ≤ j is any positive integer, then there exists a normal operator
D ∈ B(H ⊕ H) and a projection P ∈ B(H ⊕ H) of infinite rank and nullity such that
rank (I − P )DP = j
and P D(I − P ) is a quasiaffinity.

3.7. In Theorem 2.8, we saw that if D ∈ M2m (C) is a normal matrix, and if P ∈ M2m (C)
is a projection of rank m such that rank (I − P )DP = 1 and rank P D(I − P ) = m, then D
is necessarily cyclic. It is reasonable to ask, therefore, whether an analogue of this might
hold in the infinite-dimensional setting. In general, the answer is no.
3.8. Corollary. For any integer j ≥ 0, there exists a non-cyclic normal operator D ∈
B(H) and an orthogonal projection P ∈ B(H) of infinite rank and nullity such that
rank (I − P )DP = j
and P D(I − P ) is a quasiaffinity.
Proof. By Theorem 3.5, we can choose a normal operator N ∈ B(H)


is not cyclic.

4. Compact normal operators
4.1. Let D ∈ B(H) (where H is either finite- or infinite-dimensional) be a normal operator,
and let P ∈ B(H) be a non-trivial projection. Write


D1 D2
D=
D3 D4
relative to the decomposition H = ran P ⊕ ran (I − P ).
The fact that in the infinite-dimensional setting we can find D and P as above such that
D3 = 0 6= D2 , whereas no such D and P exist when dim H < ∞ is the statement that
not every normal operator acting on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space is orthogonally
reductive, whereas every normal matrix is.
In [1], the concept of an almost-invariant subspace for bounded linear operators T acting
on infinite-dimensional Banach spaces was introduced. Given a Banach space X and an
infinite-dimensional (closed) subspace M of X such that X/M is again infinite-dimensional
(M is then called a half-space of M), we say that M is almost-invariant for T if there
exists a finite-dimensional subspace F of X such that T M ⊆ M + F. The minimal dimension
of such a space F is referred to as the defect of T relative to M. In [5] and [7], it was
shown that every operator T acting on an infinite-dimensional Banach space admits an
almost-invariant half-space of defect at most 1. This is a truly remarkable result.
As a possible generalisation of the notion of reductivity for Hilbert space operators, we
propose the following definition.
4.2. Definition. An operator T ∈ B(H) is said to be almost reductive if for every
projection P ∈ B(H), the condition that rank (I −P )T P < ∞ implies that rank P T (I −P ) <
∞.
4.3. It is clear that every invariant-half space is automatically almost-invariant for T . If the
notion of “almost-reductivity” is to make sense, one should expect that every orthogonally
reductive operator should be “almost reductive”.
The relevance of this to the problem we have been examining is as follows: if K ∈ B(H)
is a compact, normal operator, then it is well-known [8] that K is orthogonally reductive.
This leads to the following question.

14

4.4. Question. Is every compact, normal operator K almost reductive? (More generally,
is every reductive normal operator D ∈ B(H) almost reductive?)
Phrased another way, does there exist a compact, normal operator K and a projection
P (necessarily of infinite rank and nullity) such that
rank (I − P )KP < ∞

rank P K(I − P ) = ∞?

and

The normal operators D constructed in Theorem 3.2 and Theorem 3.5 for which rank (I −
P )DP < ∞ and rank P D(I − P ) = ∞ were definitely not compact, and nor were they
reductive.
So far, we have been unable to resolve this question. Indeed, we propose the following
(potentially simpler) question:
4.5. Question. Do there exist a compact, normal operator K ∈ B(H) and a projection
P ∈ B(H) such that rank (I − P )KP < ∞ and P K(I − P ) is a quasiaffinity?
While we do not have an answer to this question, nevertheless, there are some things that
we can say about its structure, should such an operator K exist. First we recall a result of
Fan and Fong which we shall require.
4.6. Theorem. [3, Theorem 1] Let H be a compact, hermitian operator. Then the following
are equivalent:
(a) H = [A∗ , A] for some compact operator A.
(b) There exists an orthonormal basis {en }n∈N such that hHen , en i = 0 for all n ∈ N.
Recall that a compact operator K ∈ B(H) is said to be a Hilbert-Schmidt operator if
there exists an orthonormal basis {en }∞
n=1 for H such that
!1/2

hK ∗ Ken , en i

n=1

(Equivalently, this holds for all orthonormal bases {en }∞
n=1 .) When this is the case, the
map K 7→ kKk2 defines a norm on the set C2 (H) of all Hilbert-Schmidt operators on H.
(Although this is not the original definition of C2 (H), it is equivalent to it.)
4.7.

Corollary. Let

be a compact, normal operator in B(H ⊕ H). Then K2 ∈ C2 (H) if and only if K3 ∈ C2 (H),
in which case kK2 k2 = kK3 k2 .
In particular, therefore, if K3 is a finite-rank operator, then K2 must be a Hilbert-Schmidt
operator.
Proof. Since K is normal, it follows that K1∗ K1 + K3∗ K3 = K1 K1∗ + K2 K2∗ , and thus
[K1∗ , K1 ] = K2 K2∗ − K3∗ K3 . Now K1 is compact, and so by the above theorem, there exists
an orthonormal basis {en }n∈N such that h(K2 K2∗ − K3∗ K3 )en , en i = 0 for all n ∈ N.
Suppose that K3 ∈ C2 (H). Then

4.8. The proof of Theorem 2.8 yields a very specific structure result for normal matrices
D ∈ M2m (C) for which there exists an orthogonal projection P satisfying rank (I −P )DP =
1 and rank P D(I −P ) = m. Since orthogonal reductivity and normality of matrices coincide,
Proposition 4.10 below can be seen as an extension of that structure result to the infinitedimensional setting.
4.9. Definition. By a simple bilateral chain of subspaces of a Hilbert space H we
mean a sequence of closed subspace {Mj }∞
j=−∞ with
· · · ⊂ M−2 ⊂ M−1 ⊂ M0 ⊂ M1 ⊂ M2 ⊂ · · · ,

where dim(Mj+1 ⊖ Mj ) = 1 for all j ∈ Z. We say an operator T ∈ B(H) shifts forward
a simple bilateral chain {Mj }∞
j=−∞ if
T Mj ⊂ Mj+1 , ∀j ∈ Z.

4.10. Proposition. Let T be an orthogonally reductive operator on H and assume that
relative to a decomposition H = H1 ⊕ H2 , it has the representation


A L
T =
,
F B

where F has rank one and L has infinite rank. Then T has an infinite-dimensional invariant
subspace H0 such that the restriction T0 of T to H0 shifts forward a simple bilateral chain
{Mj }∞
j=−∞ of subspaces.
Proof. Assume with no loss that T is invertible and let M0 = H1 . We will define subspace
Mj inductively: we set

and
Then
and

Mj+1 = Mj + T Mj , ∀j ≥ 0
Mj−1 = Mj ∩ T −1 Mj , ∀j ≤ 0.
· · · ⊂ M−1 ⊂ M0 ⊂ M1 ⊂ · · · ,

T Mj ⊂ Mj+1 , ∀j ∈ Z.
The assumption that F has rank one implies that M1 ⊖ M0 has dimension one. It follows
inductively that the dimension of Mj+1 ⊖ Mj is at most one for all j ∈ Z. We shall show
that this difference in dimensions is exactly one for all j ∈ Z.
Suppose not. First assume j > 1. If Mj+1 = Mj , then Mj is invariant under T and
thus reducing. This means that
Pj T (I − Pj ) = 0,

16

with Pj denoting the orthogonal projection onto Mj . In particular, then
L(I − Pj ) = P0 L(I − Pj ) = 0.

But this implies that the rank of L is at most j, which is a contradiction.
The proof for j < 1 is similar. In summary, we conclude that {Mj }∞
j=−∞ is a proper
bilateralTchain of subspaces.
W∞
Now ∞
j=−∞ Mj and
j=−∞ Mj are both invariant, and hence reducing. Let
H0 = (

Mk ),

and T0 := T |H0 , then {M′j }∞
j=−∞ is the desired bilateral chain in H0 which T0 shifts forward.
✷
For compact normal operators, we can obtain a stronger result.
4.11.

Corollary. If K is a compact normal operator on H = H1 ⊕ H2 of the form


A L
K=

F B

where F has rank one and L is a quasiaffinity, then K shifts forward a simple bilateral
chain {Mj }∞
j=−∞ of subspaces. (Here it is understood that dim H1 = ∞ = dim H2 .)
Proof. It is well-known that compact normal operators are orthogonally reductive [8].
Thus we must only show that the subspace H0 of the proposition above coincides with H.
