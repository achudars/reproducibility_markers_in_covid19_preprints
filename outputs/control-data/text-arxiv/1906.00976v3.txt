Abstract: In this note we describe hadrons: mesons and baryons as strings with electric
charges on their endpoints. We consider here only the neutral system with opposite charges,
coupled to an external constant electromagnetic field. We derive certain classical solutions
including rotating folded open strings. We write down the mode expansion and canonically
quantize the system. The OPEs associated with such strings are determined. We re-derive
the non-commutativity of the zero modes and the fact that the charges modify the spacetime
metric. We show that the quantum worldsheet energy momentum tensor on the boundary
is affected by the endpoint charges and differs from the corresponding Noether current. We
determine the generalization of the Veneziano scattering amplitude for such strings in the
critical dimension. Phenomenological implications are addressed and in particular we show
that the external magnetic field can be tuned so that the amplitude vanishes for particular
kinematic setups. We discuss the generalization of such strings to non-critical four dimensional
spacetime. In particular we renormalize the divergence of the Polchinski-Strominger effective
action associated with the rotating folded string.

Introduction

Open strings with electric charges on their ends have been investigated intensively starting
from the early days of string theory and until these days. Many papers have been written
about such open strings interacting with a constant electromagnetic background fields including several landmark papers [1–4]. Reviews of the topic containing more references include
[5, 6].
What is then the reason to revisit this well studied system? In the present paper we
address this system from a different perspective. While string theory was initially constructed
to model hadron physics in the early days of the field, the focus in string theory has shifted
away from hadrons by the time the studies cited above were performed. In recent years,
the stringy nature of hadrons has been described in the context of the HISH (holography
inspired stringy hadron) model [7], with the scope of constructing a phenomenological model
of the QCD string. The basic idea here is that hadrons, both mesons and baryons, have the
structure of an open bosonic string with particles on its ends. These particles are massive,
charged and carry spin. Thus, the behavior of such strings in a constant electromagnetic
field relates to that of, for instance, nucleons or π mesons, propagating in such a background.
Unlike in the usual bosonic string theory, in which the modes of open strings correspond to
fields of the standard model or other QFTs, here we associate them with the states of hadrons.
The difference between these two points of view is manifested, for instance, in the fact that
in nature the hadronic strings have massive endpoint particles and an intercept a ≤ 01 and
hence the spin zero mode does not correspond to a tachyon but rather to a scalar meson of
positive mass, and the spin one does not correspond to a massless gauge field but to a massive
vector hadron. This string is also non-critical string theory, since we construct it directly in
four dimensions rather than in the critical dimension D = 26.
The charges at the endpoints of strings interact with an external electromagnetic background field as well as interacting electromagnetically one with the other. In fact the latter
interaction always takes place in a real world setting, but in the case where the external field
is stronger one can approximate the behavior by ignoring the fields induced by the charges.
Formally, this is done by not including the kinetic F µν Fµν term for the EM field in the action.
It turns out that there is a substantial difference between the case of the interaction with
an external EM background field of a string with opposite charges on its ends, such that the
string as a whole is neutral, q1 + q2 = 0, and the case where the charges are general, q1 6= −q2 ,
and the total charge is non-zero. In the present paper we analyze the neutral string case and
the charged string will be discussed in a sequel paper [9]. Strings with charged endpoints

Here we mean the intercept of modified Regge trajectories expressed in terms of the mass squared as a
function of the orbital rather than the total angular momentum. For a discussion of this property see section
3.3 in [8].

with mutual interaction but with no background electromagnetic field will be addressed in
an additional publication.
The endpoint charges affect the behavior of the strings in several different aspects: (i)
the solutions of the equations of motion, (ii) the classical Regge-like trajectories, (iii) the
quantum spectrum and the intercept, (iv) the operator product expansions, (v) the form
factors, and (vi) the string scattering amplitudes. In this paper we analyze each of these
aspects for strings with opposite charges.
Let us briefly summarize the main results of this paper.
• In a constant magnetic field the classical solutions that take the form of a rotating open
string with n folding points, starting from n = 1. There is no rotating solution without
a fold. These strings admit classical linear Regge trajectories with a tension which is
nT , where T is the basic string tension. The folding points rotate with the speed of
light while the speed of the endpoint charges is β = | cos φ| where φ = arctan(qB).
• In previous investigations of this type of strings it has been realized [2] that the effect
of the interaction with the external EM field is a modification of the spacetime metric,
µν

(1.1)
η →g =
1 − q2F 2
where q is the charge and F µν is the background EM field.
• It was further understood that the zero modes of the string, the center of mass coordinates, do not commute
q
[xµ , xν ] = iθµν = i F µ ρ g ρν
(1.2)
T
so that the string coupled to an external field gives a realization of a non-commutative
geometry [4].
• The modified spacetime metric enters Veneziano’s scattering amplitude via Mandelstam
variables that have to be computed using the modified metric. In addition each of the
three beta functions is multiplied by a phase associated with the non-commutativity
parameters (see eq. 9.21). The phases are a function of the momenta in the directions
affected by the field.
• En route to the determination of the vertex operators and scattering amplitude we have
found that the quantum energy-momentum tensor on the boundary of the worldsheet
has a different form compared with the one derived as a Noether current associated
with worldsheet translations or by variation with respect to the worldsheet metric. The
modification which involves the metric of 1.1 takes the form
1
T (y) = − 0 (g −1 )µν :∂y X µ ∂y X ν (y):
(1.3)
2α
where y is the coordinate on the boundary (the real axis when the worldsheet is the
upper half-plane). It should be emphasized that the bulk energy momentum tensor is
not modified and it is only the one on the boundary of the worldsheet.

• We show that for fixed target scattering there are kinematic parameters, namely momenta and scattering angles, for which by tuning the magnetic field the scattering
amplitude vanishes.
• Since we are interested in the interaction of real neutral hadrons like neutrons or ρ0
with electromagnetic background and their scattering amplitude we have to consider
the strings in the non-critical four dimensions. We address this following [10] using the
effective string theory approach of Polchinski and Strominger [11].
• In the effective string theory approach one expands around a classical solution that has a
string length much larger than the string scale. We show how the long string expansion
around the rotating string reproduces the same spectrum as the critical theory. To do
so we show how one can deal with divergences at folding points, at least one of which
is always present for the rotating string in a magnetic field.
Our results are in accordance with and complement several previous investigations of the
system in particular: the dynamics of open strings in EM background [12], spacetime noncommutativity [13], non-commutative SYM [14], holographic description [15], a saddle point
type of determination of the scattering amplitude [16] and others.
The paper is organized as follows: In the next subsection we describe hadrons, both
mesons and baryons, as charged strings in holography and HISH. In section 2 we write down
the various forms one can have for the action and the corresponding equations of motion. In
section 3 we write symmetries and conserved currents and charges of the system. In section
4 we present the general solutions of the equations of motion and its mode expansion. In the
next section 5 we write down explicitly some classical solutions of the equations of motion,
in particular a rotating folded string in magnetic field with or without massive endpoints
and stretched strings in electric field. In section 6 we canonically quantize the system. We
determine the non-commutative nature of the zero mode coordinates and we determine the
spectrum and compute the intercept of the system.
In section 7 we work out the operator product expansion of the target spacetime coordinates of the string both in the bulk and on the boundary of the worldsheet. Section 8 is devoted to the determination of the vertex operator. For that purpose we work out the quantum
energy momentum tensor on the boundary. Using this vertex operator we compute in section
9 the scattering amplitude. We show that it takes the form of a modified Veneziano amplitude
that incorporates the modified spacetime metric and the non-commutativity parameters. We
also determine certain phenomenological implications of the scattering amplitude.
In section 10 we discuss the system in non-critical dimensions. We invoke the PolchinskiStrominger effective action to determine the intercept of the system and comment on the
scattering amplitude in four dimensions. We summarize the results of this paper and present
some open questions in section 11.

1.1

Charged strings in holography and HISH

In nature mesons carry electric charge +1, 0, or −1 and baryons +2, +1, 0, −1. In holography
mesons are strings that end on flavor branes. From the point of view of the flavor branes
the ends of the strings carry electric charge and since the string has a different orientation
on its two endpoints, one can refer to one end as a “quark” and the other as an “antiquark”.
Baryons in holography are more complicated constructions of strings. They are built from
Nc strings that come out of a Dp brane that wraps a p-cycle and end on flavor branes.
The HISH model [7] maps the holographic stringy hadrons into string configurations in
four flat spacetime dimensions and with Nc = 3. Instead of strings in curved ten dimensions,
the main players in the HISH model are open strings with particles on their ends in flat four
dimensional spacetime. These particles are massive and carry electric charge and spin. For
mesons the particles represent both the “vertical segments” of the holographic strings and
the charge and spin of their end on a flavor brane. This is also the case for one end of the
baryonic string and on the other side the endpoint particle is constructed from a baryonic
vertex combined with two short strings that connect the baryonic vertex to flavor branes,
forming the holographic realization of a diquark. Both in the holographic picture and in the
HISH model there is a force that is exerted on the endpoint particles and balances the tension.
For hadrons with orbital angular momentum there is a classical centrifugal force that does
this. In addition, there is always a repulsive Casimir force [8], which keeps also hadrons with
vanishing orbital momentum from collapsing to a point.
We can assign a basic charge to the holographic flavor branes which is the electric charge
of the corresponding flavored quark, namely,
2
→ u brane
3

−

1
→ d brane
3

−

1
→ s brane
3

2
→ c brane
3

−

1
→ b brane
3

then we get for the holographic and HISH hadrons the charge setups depicted in figures 1
and 2. The diquarks used to construct the baryon in the HISH picture are endpoint particles
like the quarks, and we can associate with them a mass, an electromagnetic charge, and spin.
In figure 1 we drew the mesons associated with u and d quarks in the holographic picture
(left) and in the HISH picture (right) and similarly in figure 2 the corresponding baryons.
The vertical direction stands for the holographic radial dimension and the horizontal one for
a coordinate in the four dimensional flat space. To describe the HISH string we write an
action in the flat spacetime, taking for the string the Nambu-Goto action, plus correction
terms from the non-critical theory for dimensions less than 26, as well as appropriate terms
on the boundary of the worldsheet for the endpoint particles.
In the current paper we address only the case of neutral hadrons, namely the cases M 0
and B0 in the figures. In a similar manner to the stringy configurations depicted in the
figures, there are stringy mesons and baryons that have ends on the s, c and b flavor branes
and their charge setup in built in the same way.

the quarks.

Action, equations of motion

The action of the system we are interested in is given by
S = Sst + (Spm + Spq ) |σ=0 + (Spm + Spq ) |σ=` .
where Sst is the string worldsheet action given by the Nambu-Goto action,

Sst = −T dτ dσ −h = −T dτ dσ Ẋ 2 X 02 − (Ẋ · X 0 )2 .

(2.1)

(2.2)

In the string action hαβ = ηµν ∂α X µ ∂β X ν is the induced metric on the worldsheet and h is
its determinant, the indices α, β being either τ or σ. The target space is D dimensional
µ, ν = 0, ...D − 1. To keep track of units, we take the worldsheet coordinates τ and σ to have
dimension of length, and our action is defined on the strip: −∞ < τ < ∞ and 0 ≤ σ ≤ `.

–6–

The particles located at both endpoints of the string σ = 0 and σ = ` have an action
that is built from two parts. First is a mass term Spm given by2
Z
p
Spm = mi dτ −Ẋ 2
(2.3)
The second term in the boundary action Spq is
Z
Spq = T qi dτ Aµ (X)Ẋ µ

(2.4)

The parameters mi and qi are the mass and charge of the endpoint particles. We put a factor
of the string tension T before the charged particle action, so that we work in a convention
where qi Fµν is a dimensionless quantity, or in other words the electromagnetic fields are given
in units of the tension.
At this point we can consider two different cases. In one case we take the action 2.1 and
we treat the gauge field Aµ as a given background field Aback
µ (X). Another possibility is also
to make the gauge field dynamical by turning on a kinetic term, namely taking
Z

S → S − 2 d4 xFµν F µν
(2.5)

In this case the gauge field in Spq takes the form of Aµ (X) = Aback
µ (X) + Aµ (X) where
is the gauge field that one charge induces on the location of the other charge and vice

versa, and Aback denotes a background field. In this paper we consider only the former case
where the gauge field is a background field. In a sequel paper we will consider the dynamical
case. In section 9.1 we write the condition for when neglecting the self interaction is a good
approximation for phenomenology.
For the case of interest in this paper, of a neutral string with q1 = −q2 = q, the action
boundary terms Spq can be rewritten as a bulk term.

In the most general case Fµν is a function of X µ (τ, σ) which is evaluated at the boundary.
The action 2.1 is invariant under two dimensional reparametrization. We use the symmetry to fix the orthogonal gauge 3.1. In this gauge the bulk equations of motion read

Apart from the analysis of classical solutions, in the rest of the paper we will consider only
the case where the endpoints are massless, setting m1 = m2 = 0. For the neutral string case
q1 + q2 = 0 and without masses the boundary equations at σ = 0 and σ = ` are the same
X 0µ + qF µ ν Ẋ ν = 0

(2.12)

Symmetries and conserved currents

The classical symmetries of ordinary open string theory are two dimensional diffeomorphism,
local Weyl invariance and target space Poincaré invariance.
We now summarize the symmetries of the combined action of an open string and endpoint
charges 2.1.
3.1

Reparametrization invariance and the energy-momentum tensor

The string action Sst is classically invariant under two dimensional local reparametrization
transformations {τ, σ} → {τ̃ (τ, σ), σ̃(τ, σ)}, while the boundary action terms Spq and Spm are
invariant under one dimensional local reparametrization τ → τ̃ (τ ). It follows that the full
action is invariant under reparametrizations that do not move the boundary points σ = 0 and
`.
After fixing the orthogonal gauge,

(hτ τ + hσσ ) = (Ẋ 2 + X 02 ) = 0
2
2

hτ σ = hστ = Ẋ · X 0 = 0

(3.1)

The resulting worldsheet action is still invariant under global translations σα → σα +aα where
aα are constants independent of τ and σ. The corresponding conserved Noether current is
the energy-momentum tensor which reads
Tαβ = ∂α X µ ∂β Xµ − ηαβ L

–8–

(3.2)

Classically there is no modification to the energy-momentum tensor from the boundary action.3 That is the classical result. It will be shown later in section 8 that quantum mechanically the energy-momentum tensor is modified by the boundary charge terms.
3.2

Weyl invariance

Quantum mechanically Weyl invariance of the boundary action requires the vanishing of the
beta function associated with the coupling to the gauge field. It was shown in [2] that the
condition for the vanishing of the beta function is given by


1
ν
λ
=0
(3.3)
∂ Fµ
1 − q 2 F 2 λν
which to the leading order in α0 is Maxwell’s equation (for the derivation of the matrix factor
see 4.16). Constant Fµν which will be assumed in the rest of the paper is a trivial solution of
the above equation.
3.3

Target space Poincaré invariance

Assuming a constant background field Fµν the action is invariant under global spacetime
translations
δX µ (σ, τ ) = µ
(3.4)
for constant µ .
The corresponding Noether charge P µ is given by
Z
Pµ = T dσ Ẋµ − T qFµν X ν |σ=0 + T qFµν X ν |σ=`

(3.5)

The bulk equation is invariant under Lorentz transformations,
δX µ = ω µ ν X ν ,

(3.6)

with ωµν antisymmetric. Since Fµν is a constant background field, the boundary action is
invariant under transformations that leave it invariant
δFµν = ωµ ρ Fρν − ων ρ Fρµ = 0

(3.7)

For any Fµν in four dimensions there are two independent transformations that obey this
constraint (appendix A.1).
Generally, the generators of the Lorentz transformation are
h√
i
a
Jµν
=T
−hhab (Xν ∂b Xµ − Xµ ∂b Xν ) + qab (Fµρ Xν ∂b X ρ − Fνρ Xµ ∂b X ρ )
(3.8)
3
One way to see it is that the boundary action will not depend on the einbein on the endpoint’s worldline
[1], so when writing Tab as the variation of the action under an independent worldsheet metric in the Polyakov
formulation, there is no contribution from the boudnary.

–9–

The Noether charges are, writing the part from the NG action in the orthogonal gauge,
Z
i
h
(3.9)
Jµν = T dσ Xµ Ẋν − Xν Ẋµ + qFµρ Xν ∂σ X ρ − qFνρ Xµ ∂σ X ρ
Of course, only the charges (or combinations of charges) that correspond to transformations
leaving Fµν invariant are conserved.
3.4

Gauge invariance

The invariance of the classical action under gauge transformation Aµ (X) → Aµ (X) + ∂µ Λ(X)
is easy to prove. As was discussed in detail in [4] in the quantum picture the system has to be
regularized. Using point splitting regularization and taking into account the non-commutative
nature of the zero modes (see eq. 6.5) it was shown that the quantum action is in fact invariant
under a modified gauge transformation, involving the Moyal star product defined using the
non-commutativity phase.

General solution of the equations of motion

The most general solution of the bulk equations of motion (2.9) is a sum of left and right
moving modes,
µ
X µ (τ, σ) = XR
(τ − σ) + XLµ (τ + σ)
(4.1)
for which can we write the mode expansions
√ X αnµ −i π ω (τ −σ)

(4.2)

√ X α̃nµ −i π ω (τ +σ)
XLµ = xµL + α̃0µ (τ + σ) + i N
e ` n
ω
n
n

(4.3)

The two boundary conditions at σ = 0 and ` determine the spectrum of allowed eigenfrequencies ωn and the relation between the left and right moving oscillators, αn and α̃n . The
0
1
normalization constant N will be determined later to be N = 4πT
= α2 .
We will write the equations for the general case of any q1 and q2 before specializing to
the neutral string with q1 = −q2 = q. The boundary conditions we have to satisfy are
X 0µ + q1 F µ ν Ẋ ν = 0 ,

σ=0

(4.4)

X 0µ − q2 F µ ν Ẋ ν = 0 ,

σ=`

(4.5)

The first difference between the neutral and charged strings is that the zero modes linear in
τ and σ cannot satisfy both conditions simultaneously, unless q1 = −q2 and the boundary
condition is the same on both endpoints.
For the oscillating modes, the two boundary conditions translate into the requirements
(δνµ − q1 F µ ν )αnν = (δνµ + q1 F µ ν )α̃nν

(4.6)

(δνµ + q2 F µ ν )αnν = e−2iπωn (δνµ − q2 F µ ν )α̃nν

(4.7)

– 10 –

We define the two matrices
M1 = (1 + q1 F )−1 (1 − q1 F )

(4.8)

M2 = (1 + q2 F )−1 (1 − q2 F )

(4.9)

Such that the first boundary condition can be written in matrix notation4 as α̃n = M1 αn ,
and then the second boundary condition is
M2 M1 α = e2iπωn α

(4.10)

For q1 = −q2 then the matrices M1 and M2 are the inverse of one another, and we simply
get that the solution is ωn = n. For the general case the possible solutions are ωn = n + δ,
where δ is independent of n and is a simple function of the eigenvalues of the matrix M2 M1 .
The charged string case will be discussed fully in the sequel paper [9].
Returning to the neutral string case then, denoting q = q1 = −q2 , we have seen from the
above that the left and right moving modes are related by
α̃nµ = M µ ν αnν

(4.11)

M = (1 + qF )−1 (1 − qF )

(4.12)

where the matrix M is defined as

Throughout this paper we use matrix notation to denote tensors where the first index is an upper index
and the second is a lower index. When we define, for instance, C = (1 − qF )−1 we mean the tensor C µ ν that
obeys C µ α (δνα − qF α ν ) = δνµ .

We will see that the matrix that we have denoted g becomes important later on, where we
see how it can be interpreted as an effective metric seen by the open string.
Furthermore, the matrix M relating the left and right moving oscillators αn and α̃n can
be seen to be a Lorentz transformation. One can verify that for any choice of Fµν it obeys
η αβ M µ α M ν β = η µν

(4.17)

For a purely magnetic field M is a rotation, while for an electric field it is a boost. Some
explicit examples are in appendix A.2.

Classical solutions

Before quantizing the modes, we will write explicitly some classical solutions of the equations
of motion that are of special interest.

X 0 = eτ

X1 =

The solution also obeys the Virasoro constraints Ẋ 2 + X 02 = 0 and Ẋ · X 0 = 0. Solutions
with n > 1 describe strings that are folded on themselves n times. Under the magnetic field,
the solution with n = 1 also develops a fold at σ = `(1 − φ/π) (we will assume w.l.o.g. that
qB > 0 and hence φ > 0).
The energy and angular momentum of the rotating string are given by

Figure 3. The rotating solution of a neutral string with endpoint charges in a magnetic field. The
charges rotate around the central point between them. The magnetic field is in the z direction, coming
out of the plane, and the rotation is counterclockwise.

So that E and J are given by the familiar expressions E = π2 T L, J = n1 π8 T L2 . Note that L is
the total length of the folded string, which is n times the extent of the string in space time,
plus the additional folded segment whose length depends on the magnetic field.

Contrary to the rotating open string with Neumann boundary conditions, here the endpoints
move at a finite velocity given by
γ −1 = | sin φ|

β = | cos φ|

while the folding point in the string moves at the speed of light.

Rotating solution with endpoint masses

The classical solutions may be easier to understand when we add mass terms on the endpoints
of the string in addition to charges. Then, the boundary condition of the string is actually
the force equation on the endpoint particles, and we can see under what conditions the fold
develops. The boundary conditions with masses were already stated in eqs. 2.10-2.11.
For the ansatz of a rotating solution as in eq. 5.1, the boundary conditions are
m1 ω cos φ

− eqB cos(ω` + φ) = 0

When m = 0 we find the solution from before with ω` = nπ and φ = arctan(qB).
We want to see now the directions of the forces acting on the particle, and why the fold
has to appear. At time τ = 0, what we wrote above is the force equation on the particle in
the X 1 direction.
In the first equation, if φ = φ0 is a solution then so is φ0 + π. We pick the solution
between −π/2 and π/2 so cos φ is positive. We can also choose qB > 0 and ω > 0 so that
sin φ is also positive. The first equation can be written in terms of the velocity of the first
endpoint as
Te
+ eqBβ1 = 0
(5.10)
γ1 m1 ωβ1 −
γ1
For the other endpoint, we take the first solution, in which 0 < ω` < π. Now there are
two possibilities, either the solution requires ω` + φ > π (as we have seen it is in the massless
case), or not. If it is larger than π then a fold develops. With the fold, then the pull of string
is added to the centrifugal force, rather than subtracted from it:

If there is no fold, then the sign of the tension force is reversed, while the others remain the
same

The two options are drawn in figure 4. Solving the boundary equations 5.9 numerically shows
that, for a given value of qB there is a value of the mass below which there must be a fold in
order to obey the force equations.

Figure 4. The forces acting on the endpoint particles when the fold develops. The forces are drawn
to scale for a solution with qB = 1/8 and equal endpoint masses. In (a) we take m/T e` = 0.003 (T e`
being equal to the energy carried by the string) and we find a solution without a fold. When the
masses are taken to be even smaller, m/T e` = 0.001 then we have only the solution with the fold.

Stretched string in electric field

The simplest solution for a string stretched by an electric field in a given direction, w.l.o.g.
F01 = −E is
X0 = τ
X 1 = −qEσ
X t = pt τ
(5.13)
Where X t is some direction transverse to X 0 and X 1 . The transverse momentum is needed
to make the solution obey the Virasoro constraint Ẋ 2 + X 02 = 0 (or the full Nambu-Goto
equations of motion), and it is
p2t = 1 − q 2 E 2
(5.14)
We can understand this condition again by introducing an endpoint mass so that the boundary
condition is the force equation on the endpoint particle. For the solution above, the boundary
condition in the presence of an endpoint mass in the X 1 direction is
!
q
Ẋ 1
= T 1 − p2t − T qE

The LHS is zero since the solution is not accelerating. The condition then that the forces
be balanced can be met for a specific value of p2t , as the tension is rescaled by a factor of

Alternatively, one could have a rotating solution in a plane transverse to the electric field

Canonical quantization
Quantizing the modes

Now we take the mode expansion of section 4 and perform the quantization of the modes.
We quantize by imposing the canonical equal time commutation relations
[X µ (τ, σ), X ν (τ, σ 0 )] = 0

[X µ (τ, σ), Πν (τ, σ 0 )] = iη µν δ(σ − σ 0 )

where the congujate momentum to X µ is

where g = (1−q 2 F 2 )−1 as defined above. One also finds that for the commutator [X µ (σ), X ν (σ 0 )]

that H will take will be the addition of the normal ordering constant, which is the same as for
the Neumann string since the eigenfrequencies are the same and the regularization procedure
can be done without reference to the external field,

at the algebra of the Virasoro generators as was done in [2]. In the last equation we set

– 16 –

D = 26. In section 10 we look at the semiclassical quantization around a rotating string
solution, which replicates this result and where the renormalization can be done in a different
way. The intercept for the non-critical string will include the same (D − 2)/24 from the
fluctuations plus a contribution from the Polchinski-Strominger term in the effective such
that the total intercept is a = 1 for any dimension D (see section 10.2).
The mass-shell condition for a physical state (L0 − a)|Φi = 0 now includes the effective
metric, and it is

(6.12)
gµν pµ pν = − 0 (N − a)

On the other hand, the string is still propagating in a flat background metric, so one might
define its mass squared as

(N − a) + (gµν − ηµν )pµ pν

It is not clear what the correct definition of the mass is, whether it is to be defined
with the effective metric gµν or with the background metric ηµν . The Lorentz symmetry is
broken by the external field, and both possible definitions of the mass are invariant under the
remaining unbroken part of the symmetry.
Some authors addressing this issue in the past have defined it the former way (for instance
[2]), declaring the spectrum of the string is unchanged by the electromagnetic field, while
others used the definition with ηµν , noting the negative sign contribution to the mass squared
as we have here [12]. Most references do not relate pµ with the Noether charge associated
with as done in [12] and here.
A similar though different shift of the mass spectrum was discussed in [17] in the context
of non-neutral strings in a magnetic field. Since the effect starts at the order (qF )2 (recall
that the field is given in units of the string tension), then experiments to detect a shift in the
mass of hadrons in the presence of magnetic fields are are clearly not practical. Instead, one
may consider processes involving also closed strings, and use closed strings to probe the open
strings. Since our open strings have total charge zero, there must be processes where both
open and closed strings are involved. The closed strings propagate in the flat background and
do not interact (directly) with the external field, and for them one can unambiguously declare
that ηµν pµ pν is the mass squared, and they have the usual spectrum of M 2 = α20 (N + Ñ − 2),
and with N = Ñ for all states. An examination of interactions between closed and neutral

– 17 –

open strings in the presence of the EM field might give a preference to one of the definitions
of the mass of the open string over the other.

The operator product expansion

We compute the propagator as the singular part of
hX µ (τ, σ)X ν (τ 0 , σ 0 )i = T [X µ (τ, σ)X ν (τ 0 , σ 0 )] − :X µ (τ, σ)X ν (τ 0 , σ 0 ):

(7.1)

where T denotes time ordering and : : normal ordering.
We define the normal ordering of operators in the usual way, by putting annihilation
operators to the right of creation operators, such that
µ ν
µ ν
:αm
αn : = αm
αn

µ ν
ν
µ
:αm
α−n : = α−n
αm

(7.2)

for n > 0 and any m. As for the zero modes, one defines
:xµ pν : = :pν xµ : = xµ pν

(7.3)

This is because pµ is also an annihilation operator in the sense that pµ |0i = 0, which ensures
the vacuum is translation invariant. We also have to define :xµ xν :, since they do not commute.
There an ambiguity in how we define it, although the choice only affects the constant part of
the two point function. To make a choice, we use the symmetric option of

:xµ xν : = (xµ xν + xν xµ ) = xµ xν − [xµ , xν ]

to relate α0µ to the momentum can now be interpreted as an effective metric seen by the open
string in the presence of an external field.

Energy momentum tensor on the boundary and the vertex operator

The question we want to answer in this section is what form the energy-momentum tensor
takes, as a local operator defined on the boundary, and then how a vertex operator of the correct dimension can be constructed. Classically, and in the bulk, the energy-momentum tensor
is unaffected by the charges, and we have the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic currents
T (z) = −

1
ηµν :∂X µ ∂X ν (z):
α0

T̄ (z̄) = −

1
¯ µ ∂X
¯ ν (z̄):
ηµν :∂X
α0

(8.1)

On the boundary, z = z̄ = y we suggest that the form of T (y) = T̄ (y) should be
T (y) = −

1 −1
(g )µν :∂y X µ ∂y X ν (y):
2α0

(8.2)

where g −1 is defined as the inverse of the tensor g µν that appears in the boundary propagator.6
In other words, g enters the boundary energy-momentum tensor as would a background
metric. In addition, T (y) is defined with respect to the boundary normal ordering defined
using the boundary propagator, namely through
:X µ (y1 )X ν (y2 ): = X µ (y1 )X ν (y2 ) + 2α0 g µν log |y1 − y2 |

(8.3)

in accordance with eq. 7.8 for the boundary propagator. The extra factor of 21 in the
definition is necessary even in the usual Neumann open string case, because of the doubling
in the boundary normal ordering. Note that in this section we ignore the θµν part of 7.8 since
it does not affect the OPEs of operators that involve derivatives.
The motivation behind the above definition of T (y) is to yield the correct OPEs with
itself and other operators when computed directly on the boundary, that is for a primary
operator O, the OPE when both T and O are placed on the boundary should read [18, 19]
T (y1 )O(y2 ) ∼

O(y2 ) +

Since we lower indices with ηµν , (g −1 )µν is not the same as gµν .

– 19 –

(8.4)

In addition to T (y) we would like to examine if the open string vertex operator for the
tachyon (with momentum kµ ) also requires a change to reflect the presence of the effective
metric. We write the two operators in a more general form
T (y) = −

Vk (y) = :eivµν k

and write the different OPEs while keeping track of the different tensor contractions. Then
the boundary propagator with the “effective metric” derived from g µν implies the following
forms for OPEs involving T (y), denoting y12 ≡ y1 − y2 ,
T (y1 )X µ (y2 ) ∼

All the OPEs involving T imply that we have to take tαβ g βµ = δαµ , or tµν = (g −1 )µν .
This ensures, for example that ∂X µ is a primary operator on the boundary with dimension
one, and also that the T T OPE is of the same form as in the bulk.
−4
Specifically we want that the coefficient of the y12
term will remain ηµµ = D, which is the
central charge of the bosons, so it can be canceled by the ghost contribution of −26 on the
boundary as well as in the bulk. The OPE of the ghost part of the energy momentum tensor
with itself on the boundary is assumed to be unchanged by the presence of the external field.
This should be a reasonable assumption as the derivation of the Faddeev-Popov ghosts for
the open string does not depend on the details of the boundary condition for the bosons X µ ,
only on the fact that there is a boundary.
Explicitly, the ghost OPE

With the choice tµν = (g −1 )µν we can also read the dimension of the tachyon vertex
operator Vk as
hy (Vk ) = α0 g µν vµα vνβ k α k β
(8.16)
As discussed in section 6.2 the spectrum includes states with α0 gµν k µ k ν = 1−N . In particular
the ground state has α0 gµν k µ k ν = 1. To have the correct dimension for Vk the only possibility
is vµν = ηµν . Then all operators of the form (∂X)J Vk will have dimension J + 1 as it is for
the Neumann string.
To summarize, we define the boundary energy momentum tensor as
T (y) = −

1 −1
(g )µν :∂y X µ ∂y X ν (y):
2α0

(8.17)

and the tachyon vertex operator is defined as
Vk (y) = :eik·X (y):

(8.18)

using the normal dot product with the flat background metric. The latter definition also
ensures that the vertex operator transforms correctly under the translation symmetry X µ →
X µ + aµ , by picking up a phase eik·a . The open string vertex operator does not change its
form relative to the string without endpoint charges. It is still the exponential operator for
a string propagating in a flat background. The difference is that it is now defined w.r.t. the
boundary normal ordering, which does include g µν . This choice of Vk is also what leads to a
consistent scattering amplitude, as we will see in the next section.

The scattering amplitude

Next we consider the scattering amplitude of strings with charges on their endpoints. As in
ordinary string scattering the computation of the level amplitude translates to calculation of
expectations values of vertex operators on a geometry of a disk. The tree level amplitude

– 21 –

of strings with the charges (q, −q) on their endpoints is depicted in figure 5. Note that for
charge conservation all the strings should have the same charges on their endpoints.
The amplitude is defined as in the ordinary bosonic string theory. We compute it by
looking at the expectation value of vertex operators on the disk. The vertex operator was
defined in the previous section,
Vk (y) = :eik·X (y):
(9.1)
and it represents an asymptotic tachyon state with incoming momentum k µ .

Figure 5. The tree level amplitude of a 2 → 2 scattering of strings with (q, −q) charges on their
ends. This worldsheet can be mapped to a disk with a charge q running along its boundary.

We can use our boundary propagator (we use the result of eq. 7.8, minus the constant
part)

from the non-commutativity part, and the modified scalar product in the exponent of |y12 |.

and four point functions using our modified propagator.

where we have used momentum conservation in the first part, and antisymmetry of θµν in
the second part. The cyclic form of the phase is manifest.
Up to various constants and a delta function for momentum conservation which are the
same as in the chargeless case and will be left out of all the following, the amplitude for three
tachyons on the disk is
SD2 (k1 , k2 , k3 ) = :c1 eik1 ·X (y1 ): :c1 eik2 ·X (y2 ): :c1 eik3 ·X (y3 ): + (k2 ↔ k3 )

(9.8)

The points yi have been fixed and integration on each of them has been replaced with the
corresponding Faddeev-Popov ghost. We sum over both ways to arrange the three points on
the disk by exchanging k2 and k3 for the second term.
We assume that the expectation values of the c-ghosts in the above expression are unaffected by the change of boundary condition and are the same as in the Neumann string case,

disk, which is the first consistency condition. We see that it is a function of the momenta in
the plane affected by the external field.
If we proceed to write the four tachyon amplitude on the disk in the same way, again not
writing any additional constants, we find that

ũ = −(k1 + k4 ) (k1 + k4 ) (9.20)

such that s̃ + t̃ + ũ = −4/α0 in the usual way. In terms of s̃, t̃ and ũ the amplitude is given by


SD2 (k1 , k2 , k3 , k4 ) = eiΘst I(s̃, t̃) + eiΘsu I(s̃, ũ) + eiΘtu I(t̃, ũ) + (k2 ↔ k3 )

(9.21)

where the function I is defined via the Beta function as
I(s̃, t̃) = B(−α0 s̃ − 1, −α0 t̃ − 1)

(9.22)

The st part comes from the domain y4 > 1, while su comes from y4 < 0 and tu from
0 < y4 < 1. From the general expression 9.16 one finds that the phases are

This leads us to the final answer for the amplitude
SD2 (k1 , k2 , k3 , k4 ) = cos(Θst )I(s̃, t̃) + cos(Θsu )I(s̃, ũ) + cos(Θtu )I(t̃, ũ)

(9.26)

One can verify that the amplitude is fully crossing symmetric. The amplitude is also invariant
under q → −q, as expected.
9.1

Phenomenological implications

To relate the scattering amplitude 9.26 to scattering processes of real neutral stringy hadrons
like the neutrons or π 0 one has to derive the analogous result in four dimensions rather than
the critical dimensions. This will be discussed in the next section. Meanwhile we would like
to examine the amplitude associated with various different kinematic setups and look for ways
to confront it with experimental data.
The reference amplitude is the Veneziano formula with no electric or magnetic background turned on A0 . Next is the amplitude in the presence of electric field. In that case we
distinguish between the case where the direction of the scattering strings is parallel or perE
pendicular to the electric field AE
|| and A⊥ respectively. Similarly, there are two amplitudes

The other amplitudes are determined in a similar manner. Note that the effect on the Mandelstam variables starts at quadratic order in the field strength for small values of qE, while
the phases are linear in the field. This is true for a general EM field.
The most efficient way to confront the theoretical result for the amplitude of scattering
in the presence of constant EM field (9.26) is to look for zeros of the amplitude which are
not zeros of the amplitude without EM background. From (9.26) it is evident that this can
happen if
cos(Θst ) = 0,
cos(Θsu ) = 0,
cos(Θtu ) = 0
(9.30)
If instead only cos(Θst ) = 0 holds than the st channel of the amplitude vanishes and similarly
for su and tu. For the st amplitude to vanish we need that

This condition can be obeyed only provided that the expression inside the square brackets
does not vanish. If the scattering takes place in a plane perpendicular to either x̂1 or x̂2
obviously it does vanish. This is also the case for a center of mass scattering in the x̂1 , x̂2
plane with the momenta
~k1 = (k, 0, 0),

~k4 = (−k̃ cos φ, −k̃ sin φ, 0)

On the other hand for a scattering in the lab frame of a projectile on a fixed target with
~k1 = (k̃, 0, 0),

~k2 = (−k, 0, 0),

~k2 = (0, 0, 0),

1 − kk̃ . This equation determines the

value of k for which give k̃ the channel st vanishes. In fact it is easy to check that for this
kinematic setup this condition leads also to the vanishing of cos(Θsu ) and cos(Θtu ) and hence
of the full scattering amplitude.
Since we write the magnetic field in units of the string tension, then the effect is always
very small for realistic values of the magnetic field. The typical string tension for hadrons is
T ≈ 0.18 GeV2 , while the strongest magnetic fields producible in a lab are of the order 101
Tesla, which is ≈ 2×10−15 GeV2 . The effect of the magnetic field is also proportional to k k̃/T
and can be increased by going to higher and higher transverse momenta, but overcoming a
factor of 10−14 to reach the point where the amplitude vanishes is unrealistic.
As an aside, we note that the strongest magnetic fields in nature are in magnetars, a
type of neutron star, where fields as large as 1011 Tesla ∼ 10−5 GeV2 can exist [21, 22].
Since neutrons are strings with charged particles on their endpoints, one can hope to find
some way of making the string model applicable there. Of course this would require a lot
of work beyond the scope of this paper. Very strong magnetic fields are also found in heavy
ion collisions, in experiments such as RHIC, but there the interaction is with quark-gluon
plasma, rather than hadrons [23].
In real world hadrons there is also the interaction between the charges of the quarks that
needs to be taken into account. If we want the effect of the self interaction to be weaker than
the external field then as a first order approximation we can write the condition
r
α q2
|qF | >
(9.36)
4π T L2

where α =≈ 137
is the electromagnetic fine structure constant and the charges are given in
units of the electron charge, so they are either ± 23 or ± 13 for neutral hadrons. The fields are
again given in units of the tension, and we can estimate T L2 for hadrons as follows. For a
rotating string J − a = π8 T L2 ,8 where J is the angular momentum and a the intercept of
the Regge trajectory. A typical value of the intercept is −0.5, as for the ρ meson trajectory.
Then for the ρ0 meson for example, the RHS of the last equation can be estimated as (taking

|q| = 32 even though the ρ is a combination of uū and dd),

(9.37)

We have taken J − a ≈ 0.5 for the lowest ρ meson, but one can relax the condition by going
to higher spin mesons, which correspond to longer strings. With the above condition in mind,
even the large magnetic fields discussed above are not as large as the fields one could expect
to find in the hadron, so it is not clear if the effects of coupling the string to an external field
can be observed for real world hadrons.
8

In our previous works we argue that endpoint masses of the string modify this relation [7], but we neglect
them here.

10

The non-critical string with endpoint charges

To relate the scattering amplitude 9.26 or any other of the calculated values in the previous
sections to the physics of real world hadrons one has to consider strings in four spacetime
dimensions, rather than the critical D = 26.
A framework in which this can be done is that of effective string theory [11, 24–27].
The effective string theory description requires us to expand around a long string, a classical
solution of length L. We can then write an effective action for the transverse fluctuations
around the long string, where successive terms in the action are of increasing order of the
√
expansion parameter `s /L, with the intrinsic length scale being `s = α0 . The effective string
action gives a consistent description for the string action in any dimension D ≤ 26.
We use the prescription of Polchinski and Strominger (PS) [11], where the action is
written in the orthogonal gauge. The leading order term is the Nambu-Goto action, and the
first added term is

The coefficient is chosen is such a way that the conformal anomaly is canceled (to the relevant
order in the 1/L expansion) for any D. We do not add any new terms to the boundary.
Since the expansion requires us to start from a solution with finite length, we will examine
the expansion around the rotating solution that we had for the string in a constant magnetic
field (section 5.1).
10.1

Spectrum of fluctuations around a rotating solution

In this section we examine the quantization of the fluctuations around a rotating string in
a magnetic field and compare it to the quantization presented in previous sections, where
no such expansion was carried out. The analysis of fluctuations around rotating strings
without the background magnetic field was addressed in [28–33]. In a preceding paper we
have performed a similar analysis for a rotating string with massive endpoints [34] in a similar
manner to what is presented here. Our computation for the string in a magnetic field differs
from those in the above references by the addition of the phase φ in the solution, implying
the presence of a folding point as discussed in section 5.
µ
µ
We insert into our action X µ = Xrot
+ δX µ where Xrot
is the rotating solution of eq.
5.1. Instead of making the orthogonal gauge choice, we gauge away the time component for
the fluctuations, meaning δX 0 = 0, or X 0 = eτ . This is the static gauge which fixes τ , while
σ is essentially fixed by the choice of the function R(σ) = ω1 cos(ωσ + φ) used to define the
solution.
The full bulk action is the Nambu-Goto action plus PS term as discussed above. To get
the leading order terms in the 1/L expansion in the effective action for the fluctuations we
take only the terms quadratic in the fluctuations from the NG part of the action. The PS
term need only be evaluated on the classical solution in the leading order.

– 28 –

All the fluctuations transverse to the plane of rotation are just free fields. There is no
difference for them between the rotating and the non-rotating string, and they are unaffected
by the magnetic field. The modes in the plane of rotation are different.
In polar coordinates X 1 = ρ cos θ, X 2 = ρ sin θ, we have
ρ=

θ = ωτ + δθ

(10.2)

The mode δρ is longitudinal to the string, and contributes only boundary terms to the action,
while the mode δθ needs to be redefined to give a canonically normalized kinetic term. This
is a mode transverse to the string which we call the planar mode. In terms of

The bulk equation can be solved most generally by switching variables to y = cos(x + φ),
and inserting fn = (1 − y 2 )1/4 gn (y). Then the equation for gn is the Legendre equation, for
which the general solution is given by the associated Legendre functions Pνµ and Qµν with
µ = 3/2 and ν = ωn − 21 . Here it is simpler to write the solution directly in terms of x.
The general solution that satisfies the two boundary conditions has a rather simple form,
and it is
fn (x) = Nn (cos(nx) cot(x + φ) + n sin(nx))
(10.11)
The spectrum of eigenfrequencies being
ωn = n

(10.12)

as before. Note that n = 0 also a gives a valid solution, corresponding to a constant shift in
θ.
There is a subtlety to deal with now since the solutions diverge at the folding point
x + φ = π. Before we had the magnetic field, this divergence was at the endpoints of the
string, and was dealt with by appropriate boundary terms. Without any regularization, the
functions fn are not normalizable. From standard Sturm-Liouville theory, the eigenfunctions
should satisfy the orthonormality relation (for m 6= n)

dxfm fn + tan φfm fn |π0 = π(δm+n + δm−n )

This equation also defines the measure with respect to which we normalize our eigenfunctions.
Since fn (π) = (−1)n fn (0) the second term on the LHS drops when m + n is even, and in
particular for m = n.
With no magnetic field the eigenmodes diverge at the endpoints, which can be resolved by
adding appropriate counter terms on the boundary. The problem of the folding point is that
it takes the divergence to some point in the bulk of the string, where no natural counterterms
can be written to deal with the divergence.
One possible solution is to introduce a massive particle on the folding point so that it
will no longer move at the speed of light. Then the eigenmodes have are finite at the folding
point. Then we can renormalize by taking the massless limit properly in a manner similar to
that presented in [34] for the string with massive endpoints. This procedure will be described
in detail in a follow up paper [35].
The starting point is a classical rotating solution for the system that has a mass at the
point where the string is folded. If the fold is at the point σ = s and we insert the usual
massive particle worldline term into the action, fixed at that point, then in addition to the
boundary condition at the endpoints we have the condition at the folding point

where i = 3, . . . , D − 1 are the transverse directions. Since ωn = n for all modes we find
the same spectrum around the rotating solution as we did before when we performed the full
quantization of the theory. The same result can be obtained by solving the system with a
finite mass at the folding point, and taking the massless limit only at the end.
The Hamiltonian for the fluctuations around the rotating string is then essentially the
same as the one found in section 6.2. However, we do not see the structure of the zero modes
and the non-commutativity in this analysis.
Since we are looking at the spectrum of transverse excitations around the string, we do
not have any momentum, at least not in the plane of rotation. Without momentum we cannot
hope to see the effective metric in this case. As for the non-commutativity of [x1 , x2 ] 6= 0, for
our classical solution we can certainly choose to place our string at the origin x1 = x2 = 0.
In our solutions for the modes in the plane of rotation fp and fr , we have only the zero mode
α0p , which amounts to a constant shift in the angle θ that does not move the center of mass.
One way to see if the semi-classical expansion of the rotating string retains in some form the
non-commutativity is to compute the two point function hX 1 X 2 i to see if there is a phase
as in the propagator without rotation (eq. 7.8), which is a more physical manifestation of
the non-commutativity than the commutator of the zero modes. We leave that as an open
question, and turn to the computation of the intercept in the non-critical rotating string.
10.2

The intercept

Next we would like to determine the intercept associated with the folded rotating string
solution in non-critical dimensions, in the presence of the magnetic field. A more general
and complete analysis of rotating strings with folds, which includes both the open string in
electromagnetic background and folded closed strings will appear in [35]. Here we summarize
the results for the former case.
The intercept in the semiclassical expansion around the rotating string solution can be
defined as
a = hJ − Jcl (E)i
(10.24)
where J is the angular momentum and Jcl (E) the function relating J and the energy of the
string at the classical level. For the ordinary open string Jcl (E) = α0 E 2 . In terms of the

The intercept has a contribution of 24
from each of the D − 2 modes transverse to the
string, including the planar mode discussed in the previous subsection.
For the non-critical string, in the leading order we have in addition to the result of eq.

This term will contribute a correction to the intercept for D 6= 26. The integral diverges, with
the source of the divergence being the folding point x+φ = π that moves at the speed of light.
For the string with no charges the divergence can be regularized by appropriate boundary
terms as counterterms, which are a geodesic curvature term or massive endpoints of the string
[29, 31, 33, 34]. For the rotating solution in a magnetic field, it is the folding point, rather
than the endpoints of the string, that moves at the speed of light, and consequently we cannot
regularize the divergence by adding boundary terms.
We again turn to the solution with a massive particle on the folding point described in
the previous subsection. Evaluating the PS Lagrangian on this solution, we find the same
form as for the string with massive endpoints,

where here the relevant velocity β is that of the massive particle at the folding point. As
explained in [34], we can write the energy in terms of the effective length of the rotating
string,

and the relativistic mass m̃ = γm, since that is the form that appears in the classical energy
of the rotating string solution
E = γm + T L

For the string with massive endpoints it was argued that we can redefine the mass at the
endpoint of the rotating string to eliminate the first term in EP S that diverges in the massless
limit, and that we get the correct finite result for the intercept by considering only the 1/L̃

value of the magnetic field, so that

Comments on the scattering amplitude for non-critical strings

In the previous section we discussed the spectrum and the intercept at non-critical dimensions.
We would like next to address the same issue about the scattering amplitude, namely, the
vertex operators and the expectation values of their products.
In [10] off-shell vertex operators in effective string theory in non-critical dimension were
written down. It is emphasized there that these vertex operators correspond to external
background fields rather than states of the string theory itself. For our purposes this is not
what is needed. Instead we need the on-shell vertex operator for the scalar state of the open
string.9 Nevertheless, we would like to examine the proposal of [10]. The boundary vertex
operator of a scalar state in non-critical dimensions is expected to take the form
Vk = :eiηµν k

µXν

eγϕ (y):

(10.32)

where ϕ is the Liouville field and β should be determined from the requirement that the
operator have dimension one. It was shown in [11, 27] that the Liouville field can be expressed
as a composite operator of the following form
1
ϕ = − log (∂α X µ ∂ α Xµ )
2

(10.33)

Following the discussion of section (8) the space time metric in this expression should be ηµν .
Thus, the vertex operator takes the form
Vk = :eiηµν k

µXν

(∂α X µ ∂ α Xµ )−γ/2 (y):

(10.34)

However, the world sheet energy momentum tensor that determines β should have the
modified metric as in (8.2). In addition there is a contribution of the Liouville term so the
boundary energy momentum tensor reads
!
1 −1
D − 26 (g −1 )µν :∂y X µ ∂y3 X ν (y):

(10.35)

(g −1 )µν :∂y X µ ∂y X ν (y):

In the ordinary string theory this is obviously a tachyonic state but in the string theory of hadrons it is
not since there are such hadronic states like π 0 . This can achieved if in that theory the intercept is negative
[8].

– 34 –

In [10] it was found out that to determine γ to leading order one has to use only the first
term in the energy momentum tensor and at that order the vertex operator reads
Vk = :eiηµν k

µXν

0

(∂α X µ ∂ α Xµ )−α k

k+1

(y):

(10.36)

The conclusion is thus that to leading order since on shell α0 k k = 1 the Liouville dressing
is dropped off and the vertex operator is the one of the critical dimensions. In fact also the
first order correction to the vertex operator found in [10] vanishes on shell. Hence it seems
that to leading order in the string length the scattering amplitude of the non-critical string
is the same as that of the critical string.

Summary

In this paper we have determined the scattering amplitude of an open string with two opposite charges on its endpoints in a constant electromagnetic background field. As part of the
introduction we have already summarized the results of this work. These include: (i) Classical solutions of rotating strings requiring folds. (ii) The modification of the spacetime metric
along the directions of the EM field. (iii) The non-commutativity of the center of mass coordinates along those directions. (iv) The determination of the scattering amplitude for this type
of strings, including the Mandelstam variables that are changed due to the modified metric
and certain phases that follow from the non-commutativity parameters. (v) The fact that
the quantum energy momentum on the boundary of the string worldsheet is affected by the
boundary charges and is different from the Noether procedure result. (vi) Phenomenological
implications including the observation that by tuning the magnetic field or the kinematic parameters the scattering amplitude can be set to zero. (vii) Mapping the scattering amplitude
of strings in the critical dimensions to the case of non-critical four dimensions.
There are several open questions that follow from the results of the current paper. Among
them are:
• The second part of this project is the determination of the scattering amplitude of
a string with charges at the endpoints of an open string for the general case where
the total charge of the string is non-zero, q1 + q2 = Q 6= 0. This generalization is
highly non-trivial, in part due to the fact that the general charges now implies different
boundary conditions for the two endpoints of the string. In section 4 we showed how
that implies a constant shift in the spectrum. The charged string case raises several
other questions, for instance if there is a quantization condition on the endpoint charges,
and the question of how one expands around an accelerating string if there is an electric
field. All these questions will be addressed in a sequel publication [9].
• As we have already mentioned part of the motivation for this analysis is to determine
physical experiments that will verify the stringy nature of hadrons. Here in this note we
took a constant electromagnetic field to couple to the open strings. In a similar manner

– 35 –

one see how the string is affected by non-constant fields, like for instance electromagnetic
plane waves or other types of radiation fields.
• Hadronic strings in the form of open strings with massive and charged endpoints differ
from the ordinary string not only when coupled to an external electromagnetic fields
but also due to the mutual electromagnetic interaction between the two endpoints. An
analysis of the corresponding quantum spectra of such strings and scattering amplitudes
will be presented in future work.
• Part of the motivation for the present paper has been to develop new ways to be sensitive
to the stringy nature of hadrons. In addition to the spectrum we would like to have
more measurable quantities that will enable us to reveal the stringy nature of hadrons.
Form factors like magnetic moments and structure functions are different for hadrons
as composite particles and hadrons as strings.
• The generalization of Veneziano’s amplitude to the scattering amplitude of strings in
four or any other non-critical dimensions has not been investigated thoroughly. Certain
issues have been worked out in [10] when considering the ordinary open string. We have
made several basic comments about the case of strings with charges on their endpoints.
Further exploration of this issue in both the ordinary and charged strings is an obvious
open question.
• A very important challenge of any stringy determination of scattering amplitudes of
hadrons is to be able to incorporate the “bending” of the Regge trajectories α(t) at
very large negative t, which follows from the asymptotic freedom of QCD even at large
Nc .10 This issue will be the subject of our future research work.
• For the hadronic strings which have massive endpoints, or the string in the magnetic
field, it is natural to expand around a rotating solution. We have shown that quantizing
the fluctuations around the rotating strings gives the same spectrum that we get without
the expansions. However, the structure of zero modes is different and this needs further
exploration. Another important question is seeing how such a semi-classical expansion
can be used to compute scattering amplitudes for long non-critical strings.
• Another interesting feature of the rotating strings is that they can develop folds, and the
rotating solution in a magnetic field requires at least one fold. These folds introduce
certain divergences, and we have given a short explanation here of how they can be
regularized by introducing a mass at the fold. This treatment can be generalized to
other solutions with folds, specifically to rotating closed strings.

Examples and particular cases
Lorentz symmetry

In four dimensions, there are two independent solutions of eq. 3.7, that is two symmetries
that remain unbroken after fixing the external field Fµν . In four dimensions, we can always
go to a frame where the electric field to is parallel to X 1 , then rotating in the 23 plane to
eliminate the X 2 component of the magnetic field. Then

Here we see clearly the a critical value of the field |qE| = 1, where the metric is singular [3].
Another interesting particular case is when we combine an electric with a transverse
magnetic field. We take F01 = −E and F12 = B = αE. If |α| < 1 we can boost the system
to a frame with only an electric field, while for |α| > 1 we have a frame with only a magnetic
field, so the return to one of the two cases described above. In the special case of α = 1,
