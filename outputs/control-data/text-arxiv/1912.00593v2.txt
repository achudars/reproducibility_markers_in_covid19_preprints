Abstract. The method of Frobenius is a standard technique to
construct series solutions of an ordinary linear differential equation around a regular singular point. In the classical case, when
the roots of the indicial polynomial are separated by an integer,
logarithmic solutions can be constructed by means of perturbation
of a root.
The method for a regular A-hypergeometric system is a theme
of the book by Saito, Sturmfels, and Takayama. Whereas they perturbed a parameter vector to obtain logarithmic A-hypergeometric
series solutions, we adopt a different perturbation in this paper.

1. Introduction
The method of Frobenius is a standard technique to construct series
solutions of an ordinary linear differential equation around a regular
singular point. In the classical case, when the roots of the indicial
polynomial are separated by an integer, logarithmic solutions can be
constructed by means of perturbation of a root (cf. e.g. [6]).
Let A = (a1 , . . . , an ) = (aij ) be a d × n-matrix of rank d with
coefficients in Z. Throughout this paper, we assume the homogeneity
of A, i.e., we assume that all aj belong to one hyperplane off the origin
in Qd . Let N be the set of nonnegative integers. Let IA denote the
toric ideal in the polynomial ring C[∂] = C[∂1 , . . . , ∂n ], i.e.,
(1)

IA = h∂ u − ∂ v : Au = Av, u, v ∈ Nn i ⊆ C[∂].

Here and hereafter we use the multi-index notation; for example, ∂ u
means ∂ u1 · · · ∂ un for u = (u1 , . . . , un )T . Given a column vector β =
(β1 , . . . , βd )T ∈ Cd , let HA (β) denote the left ideal of the Weyl algebra
D = Chx1 , . . . , xn , ∂1 , . . . , ∂n i
generated by IA and

where θj = xj ∂j . The quotient MA (β) = D/HA (β) is called the Ahypergeometric system with parameter β, and a formal series annihilated by HA (β) an A-hypergeometric series with parameter β. The
homogeneity of A is known to be equivalent to the regularity of MA (β)
by Hotta [5] and Schulze, Walther [9].
For a generic parameter β, Gel’fand, Graev, Kapranov, and Zelevinsky [3], [4] constructed series solutions to MA (β). More generally,
Saito, Sturmfels, and Takayama [8] constructed logarithm-free series
solutions, which we will review in Section 2. Then they perturbed
a parameter vector to construct logarithmic series solutions [8, §3.5].
This is reasonable, because this method perturbed the easier equations
(2) keeping the difficult ones (1) unchanged. Then we can easily obtain perturbed solutions. However, we need to make a suitable linear
combination of perturbed solutions before taking a limit, and it is not
clear how to describe this linear combination (except the unimodular
case [8, §3.6]).
Set
(3)

L := KerZ (A) = {u ∈ Zn | Au = 0}.

We know that the logarithmic coefficients of A-hypergeometric series
solutions are polynomials of log xb (b ∈ L) [7, Proposition 5.2]. In
this paper, we adopt a perturbation by elements of L. At first glance,
it does not seem a good idea, because we perturb a solution of the
difficult equations (1) keeping the easier ones (2). But it turns out
that we can evaluate the order of perturbation, and we can explicitly
describe logarithmic series solutions (Theorems 5.4, 6.2 and Remarks
5.6, 6.3).
In [1], Adolphson and Sperber treated A-hypergeometric series solutions with logarithm mainly of degree 1 or 2, and considered an application to mirror symmetry.
This paper is organized as follows. In Sections 2 and 3, following [8],
we recall some notions on A-hypergeometric series. In particular, we
recall fake exponents and negative supports in Section 2, and then we
recall that the fake exponents can be computed by the standard pairs
of the initial ideal of IA in Section 3.
In Section 4, for a generic weight w and a fake exponent v, we
define a set NSw (v) of negative supports, over which we consider a
series. Then we introduce a Gale dual and a hyperplane arrangement
to visualize negative supports.
In Sections 5 and 6, we state the main results (Theorems 5.4, 6.2 and
Remarks 5.6, 6.3). We consider a perturbation by a single element and
several elements of L in Sections 5 and 6, respectively. We make one

section for the single element case, because it is much easier to consider.
In both sections, we first consider orders of perturbations (Lemma 5.1,
Corollaries 5.2, 5.3, and Lemma 6.1). Then we see that the perturbed
solution operated by the difficult ones (1) has some positive orders, and
we can prove the main results.
Throughout this paper we run three examples (Examples 3.1, 3.2,
and 3.3) to illustrate the theory.
2. logarithm-free canonical A-hypergeometric series
In this section, we recall logarithm-free canonical A-hypergeometric
series. For details, see [8].
Fix a generic weight vector w = (w1 , . . . , wn ) ∈ Rn . The ideal of the
polynomial ring C[θ] = C[θ1 , . . . , θn ] defined by
(4)

f w (HA (β)) := D · inw (IA ) ∩ C[θ] + hAθ − βi
fin

is called the fake indicial ideal, where inw (IA ) denotes the initial ideal
of I with respect to w, and hAθ − βi denotes the ideal generated by
Pn A
f
j=1 aij θj − βi (i = 1, . . . , d). Each zero of finw (HA (β)) is called a fake
exponent.
Let w ·u denote w1 u1 +· · ·+wn un for u ∈ Qn . An A-hypergeometric
series

(gu ∈ C[x] := C[x1 , . . . , xn ])

is said to be in the direction of w if there exists a basis u(1) , . . . , u(n)
of QnPwith w · u(j) > 0 (j = 1, . . . , n) such that gu = 0 whenever
n

j=1 Q≥0 u . A fake exponent v is called an exponent if there
exists an A-hypergeometric series (5) in the direction of w with nonzero
g0 . Let ≺ be the lexicographic order on Nn . Suppose that u(1) , . . . , u(n)
is a basis as above. Then a monomial like xv · in≺ (g0 )(log x) in the Ahypergeometric series
X
(6)
xv ·

Q≥0 u(j)

with nonzero g0 is called a starting monomial. The A-hypergeometric
series (6) is said to be canonical with respect to w if no starting monomials other than xv · in≺ (g0 )(log x) appear in the series.
Next we recall logarithm-free A-hypergeometric series φv . For v ∈
Cn , its negative support nsupp(v) is the set of indices i with vi ∈
Z<0 . When nsupp(v) is minimal with respect to inclusions among
nsupp(v + u) with u ∈ L, v is said to have minimal negative support.

u− ∈ Nn satisfy
Q u = u+ − u− with disjoint supports, and
[v]u = nj=1 [vj ]uj = nj=1 vj (vj − 1) · · · (vj − uj + 1) for u ∈ Nn .
Proposition 3.4.13 and Theorem 3.4.14 in [8] respectively state that
the series φv is A-hypergeometric, and that if v is a fake exponent of
MA (β), then φv is canonical, and v is an exponent.
3. Standard pairs and fake exponents
In this section, we review standard pairs and fake exponents following
[8].
Let M be a monomial ideal in C[∂] = C[∂1 , . . . ∂n ]. A pair (a, σ)
(a ∈ Nn , σ ⊆ [1, n]) is standard if it satisfies
(1) ai = 0 for all i ∈ σ.
(2) For any b ∈ Nσ , ∂ a ∂ b ∈
/ M.
(3) For any l ∈
/ σ, there exists b ∈ Nσ∪{l} such that ∂ a ∂ b ∈ M .
Let S(M ) denote the set of standard pairs of M . Then, by [8, Corollary 3.2.3], v is a fake exponent of MA (β) with respect to w if and only
if Av = β and there exists a standard pair (a, σ) ∈ S(inw (IA )) such
that vj = aj for all j ∈
/ σ.

Hence
S(inw (IA )) = {(0, 0, ∗, ∗), (0, ∗, ∗, 0), (0, ∗, ∗, 1), (∗, ∗, 0, 0), (1, ∗, 1, 0)}.

• v 2 := (1, −4, 1, 0)T ↔ (1, ∗, 1, 0).
Since v ∅ , v 2 , v 3 have minimal negative supports, φv∅ , φv2 , φv3 are solutions.

S(inw (IA )) = {(0, 0, ∗, ∗, ∗), (∗, 0, 0, ∗, ∗), (∗, ∗, 0, 0, ∗), (0, ∗, ∗, 0, ∗)}.

4. Negative supports and hyperplane arrangements
In this section, first we see that the sum (5) is taken over a set of negative supports. Then we define a set NSw (v) of negative supports, and
we introduce a Gale dual and a hyperplane arrangement to visualize
negative supports.
For an A-hypergeometric series φ (5), set
supp(φ) := {u | gu 6= 0}.
Proposition 4.1. Let φ be an A-hypergeometric series (5). Suppose
that u ∈ supp(φ) and nsupp(v + u) = nsupp(v + u0 ) for u, u0 ∈ L.
Then u0 ∈ supp(φ). Furthermore, the highest log-terms of xv+u and
0
xv+u are the same up to nonzero scalar multiplication.

Proof. Suppose that xv+u p(log x) is the highest log-terms of xv+u . Consider
(u0 − u) = (u0 − u)+ − (u0 − u)−
and
0
∂ (u −u)− xv+u p(log x).
Suppose that u0j − uj < 0.
• If j ∈ nsupp(v + u) = nsupp(v + u0 ), then vj + u0j = vj + uj +
(u0j − uj ) < vj + uj < 0. Hence [vj + uj ]uj −u0j 6= 0.
• Suppose that j ∈
/ nsupp(v + u) = nsupp(v + u0 ). If vj ∈
/ Z,
then clearly [vj + uj ]uj −u0j 6= 0. If vj ∈ Z, then 0 < vj + u0j =
vj + uj + (u0j − uj ) < vj + uj . Hence [vj + uj ]uj −u0j 6= 0.
0

Hence the highest log-term of ∂ (u −u)− (xv+u p(log x)) is equal to
0

(∂ (u −u)− xv+u )p(log x),
which is not zero. Hence u0 ∈ supp(φ). Do the same argument exchanging u and u0 , and find that the highest log-terms of xv+u and
0
xv+u are the same up to nonzero scalar multiplication.

Let w be a generic weight. Suppose that G := {∂ u+ − ∂ u− | i =

inw (IA ) for all i. Set

Then u ∈ C(w).

Proof. Since G is a Gröbner
Prbasis, ∂(i) − ∂ is reduced to 0 by G. This
means that u belongs to i=1 Nu .


Corollary 4.3. Let φ be an A-hypergeometric series with exponent v
in the direction of w. Suppose that u ∈ supp(φ). Then
{u0 ∈ L | nsupp(v + u0 ) = nsupp(v + u)} ⊆ C(w).
Proof. We may assume that w1 , . . . , wn are linearly independent over
Q.
By Proposition 4.1, for u0 ∈ L with nsupp(v + u0 ) = nsupp(v + u),
we have u0 ∈ supp(φ). If u0 = 0, then clearly u0 ∈ C(w).
Let u0 6= 0. Since φ is in the direction of w, we have w · u0 > 0, or
w · u0+ > w · u0− . By Lemma 4.2, u0 belongs to C(w).

and
NSw (v)c := {nsupp(v + u) | u ∈ L} \ NSw (v).
Proposition 4.4. Let w be a generic weight, and v a fake exponent.
Then
{nsupp(v + u) | nsupp(v + u) ⊆ nsupp(v), u ∈ L} ⊆ NSw (v).
In particular, nsupp(v) ∈ NSw (v).
Proof. We may assume that w1 , . . . , wn are linearly independent over
Q.
Let u ∈ L \ {0}. We show
(10)

nsupp(v + u) ⊆ nsupp(v) ⇒ w · u > 0.

Suppose that w · u < 0. Then ∂ u− xv = 0 since v is a fake exponent.
Hence there exists j such that uj < 0, vj ∈ N, and vj +uj < 0. Namely,
j ∈ nsupp(v+u)\nsupp(v), and we have proved (10). Then by Lemma
4.2, we have u ∈ C(w) (this is also valid for u = 0.).

Corollary 4.5. Let v have the smallest w-weight among the set of fake
exponents in v + L.
If v + u0 is a fake exponent, then nsupp(v + u0 ) ∈ NSw (v).
Proof. We may assume that w1 , . . . , wn are linearly independent over
Q.
If u0 = 0, then the assertion is in Proposition 4.4. Suppose that
u0 6= 0. By the minimality of v, we have w · u0 > 0. If nsupp(v + u0 +
u) = nsupp(v + u0 ), then w · u ≥ 0 by (10). Hence u0 + u ∈ C(w)
by Lemma 4.2, and nsupp(v + u0 ) ∈ NSw (v).

To visualize NSw (v), we introduce a Gale dual (cf. e.g. [11]). Let
{b1 , b2 , . . . , bn−d } be a basis of L. Set
B := (b1 , b2 , . . . , bn−d ) = (g 1 , g 2 , . . . , g n )T .
For v ∈ Cn , define
ψv : Rn−d ' v + LR ⊆ Cn
by ψv (x) = v + Bx, where LR = R ⊗Z L. Set Z(v) := {i ∈ [1, n] | vi ∈
Z}. For a subset I ⊆ Z(v), set
(11)

NI (v) := {v + u | nsupp(v + u) = I}.

8

Then
NI (v) = {z ∈ v + L | zi < 0 (i ∈ I); zj ≥ 0 (j ∈ Z(v) \ I)}
= {z ∈ v + L | e∗i (z) < 0 (i ∈ I); e∗j (z) ≥ 0 (j ∈ Z(v) \ I)},
where {e∗i | 1 ≤ i ≤ n} is the dual basis of the standard basis {ei | 1 ≤
i ≤ n} of Cn . Hence NI (v) is the set of lattice points in a union of
faces of the hyperplane arrangement {e∗i = 0 | i ∈ Z(v)} on v + LR .
Transfer this to the hyperplane arrangement on Rn−d by ψv . Since
(ψv∗ (e∗i ))(x) = (e∗i )(ψv (x)) = (e∗i )(v + Bx)
= vi + (B T ei )(x) = vi + g i (x),
we can regard NI (v) as the set of lattice points in a union of faces of
the hyperplane arrangement {Hi | i ∈ Z(v)} on Rn−d , where
Hi = {x ∈ Rn−d | g i (x) + vi = 0}.

In (vi + sbi )(vi − 1 + sbi ) · · · (vi − ui + 1 + sbi ), the factor s appears if
and only if vi ∈ N and vi − ui ∈ Z<0 , and furthermore if that is the
case, it appears only once and always with bi .
Finally note that nsupp(v − u) ⊇ nsupp(v). Hence |nsupp(v − u) \
nsupp(v)| = |nsupp(v − u)| − |nsupp(v)|.

Corollary 5.2. Let b, u ∈ L. Suppose that bj 6= 0 for any j. Then
(1) ords ([v + sb]u− ) = |nsupp(v + u) \ nsupp(v)|.
(2) ords ([v + sb + u]u+ ) = |nsupp(v) \ nsupp(v + u)|.
Proof. (1) By Lemma 5.1, ords ([v+sb]u− ) = |nsupp(v−u− )\nsupp(v)|.
We have nsupp(v + u) = nsupp(v + u+ − u− ) ⊆ nsupp(v − u− ).
Hence (nsupp(v + u) \ nsupp(v)) ⊆ nsupp(v − u− ) \ nsupp(v).
Let j ∈ nsupp(v − u− ) \ nsupp(v). Then uj < 0. Hence (u+ )j = 0,
and j ∈ nsupp(v − u− + u+ ) \ nsupp(v). Therefore nsupp(v − u− ) \
nsupp(v) = nsupp(v + u) \ nsupp(v).
(2) In (1), replace v, u by v + u, −u, respectively.

Thus each coefficient of ∂ u+ s|I0 |−m (au (s)xv+sb+u ) has order at least
M − m in s, and we have proved the first part of (1). By looking at

Remark 5.5. Since the degrees of logarithmic polynomials in the coefficients of (∂sj s|I0 |−m Fb (x, s))|s=0 are less than or equal to j,
(∂sj s|I0 |−m Fb (x, s))|s=0

(j = |I0 | − m, . . . , M − m − 1)

in Theorem 5.4 (1) are basic Nilsson series solutions [2, Definition 2.6].
Remark 5.6. In Theorem 5.4, we may replace NSw (v) and NSw (v)c by
any N ⊆ NSw (v) with N 3 nsupp(v) and N c := (NSw (v) ∪ NSw (v)c ) \
N . Indeed, the proof of Theorem 5.4 is also valid for N and N c .
Example 5.7. Let v be a fake exponent with minimal negative support, and N := {nsupp(v)}.
Then for any J ∈ N c we have I0 ∪ J ) I0 . Hence M > |I0 | = m,

6. Method 2
In this section, we consider a Frobenius’s method by perturbing an
exponent with several vectors in L.
Let v be a fake exponent, and b(1) , b(2) , . . . , b(l) ∈ L. We suppose
(j)
that for any i ∈ nsupp(v) there exists j such that bi 6= 0.
For such b(1) , b(2) , . . . , b(l) ∈ L, set
X
Fb(1) ,b(2) ,...,b(l) (x, s) :=
au (s)xv+sb+u ,
nsupp(v+u)∈NSw (v)

where
s = (s1 , s2 , . . . , sl ),

sb = s1 b(1) + s2 b(2) + · · · + sl b(l) ,
