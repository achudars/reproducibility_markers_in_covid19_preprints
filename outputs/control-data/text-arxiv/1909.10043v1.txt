Special unextendible entangled basis of “type k” (SUEBk), a set of incomplete orthonormal special
entangled states of “type k” whose complementary space has no special entangled state of “type k”.
This concept can be seem as a generalization of the unextendible product basis (UPB) introduced
by Bennett et al. in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 5385(1999)] and the unextendible maximally entangled
basis (UMEB) introduced by Bravyi and Smolin in [Phys. Rev. A 84, 042306(2011)]. We present
an efficient method to construct sets of SUEBk. The main strategy here is to decompose the whole
space into two subspaces such that the rank of one subspace can be easily upper bounded by k while
the other one can be generated by two kinds of the special entangled states of type k. This method
is very effective for those k = pm ≥ 3 where p is a prime number. For these cases, we can otain sets
of SUEBk with continuous integer cardinality when the local dimensions are large. Moreover, one
can find that our method here can be easily extended when there are more than two kinds of the
special entangled states of type k at hand.

INTRODUCTION

Unextendible product basis (UPB)[1, 2], a set of incomplete orthonormal product states whose complementary space has no product states, has been shown to be
useful for constructing bound entangled states and displaying quantum nonlocality without entanglement [3–5].
As anology of the UPB, Bravyi and Smolin introduced
the unextendible maximally entangled basis (UMEB)
[6],N
a set of orthonormal maximally entangled states in
Cd Cd consisting of fewer than d2 vectors which have
no additional maximally entangled vectors orthogonal to
all of them. There they proved that no UMEB exists
in twoN
qubits systemN
and presented examples of UMEBs
in C3 C3 and C4
C4 . Since then, the UMEB was
further studied by several reseachers [7–14]. Lots of the
works pay attention
N ′ to the UMEBs for general quantum
systems Cd Cd . The cardinality of the constructed
UMEBs are always multiple of d or d′ .
Guo et al. extended these two concepts to the states
with fixed Schmidt numbers and studied the complete
basis [15] and the unextendible ones [16]. There they introduced the notion of special entangled states of type
k (SESk): an entangled state √whose nonzero Schmidt
coefficients are all equal to 1/ k. Then a special unextendible entangled basis of type k (SUEBk)is a set of
N ′
orthonormal SESk in Cd Cd consisting of fewer than
dd′ vectors which have no additional SESk orthogonal to
all of them. Quite rencently, there are several results related to this subject [17, 18]. Similar to the UMEBs, the
cardinality of most of the known SUEBk’s are multiple
of k.
Therefore, it is interesting to ask whether there are
SUEBks with continuous integer cardinality or not. In-

spired by the technique used in [19], we try to study this
question in this paper.
The remaining of this article is organized as follows.
In Sec. II, we first introduce the concept of special unextendible entangled basis and its equivalent form in matrix
settings. In Sec. III, we present our main idea to construct the SUEBk. In Sec. IV and V, based on the combinatoric concept: weighing matrices, we give two kinds
of constructions of SUEBk whose cardinality varying in a
consecutive integer set. Finally, we draw the conclusions
and put forward some interesting questions in the last
section.

PRELIMINARIES

Let [n] denote the set {1, 2, · · · , n}. Let HA , HB be
Hilbert spaces of dimension d and d′ respectively. ′ It is
well known that any bipartite pure state in Cd ⊗ Cd has
a Schmidt decomposition. That is, any unit vector |φi in
′
Cd ⊗ Cd can be written as
|φi =

k
X
i=1

λi |ei iA |ei iB ,

k
X

λ2i = 1

i=1

where λi > 0 and {|ei iA }ki=1 ({|ei iB }ki=1 ) are orthonormal states of system A (resp. B). The number k is known
as the Schmidt number of |φi and we denote it by Sr (φ).
The set Λ(|φi) := {λi }ki=1 is called the nonzero Schmidt
√
coefficients of |φi. If all these λi s are equal to 1/ k, we
call |φi a special entangled state of type k (2 ≤ k ≤ d).
And we denote the set of all the special entangled states
of type k to be SESk. One notice that SESk is exactly
′
the set of maximally entangled states in Cd ⊗ Cd when
k = min{d, d′ }.
Definition 1 (See [15]). A set of states {|φi i}ni=1 (1 ≤
′
n ≤ dd′ − 1) in Cd ⊗ Cd is called a special unextendible

2
entangled basis of type k (SUEBk) if
(1) hφi |φj i = δij , i, j ∈ [n];
(2) |φi i ∈ SESk for all i ∈ [n];
(3) If hφi |φi = 0 for all i ∈ [n], then |φi ∈
/ SESk.
The concept SUEBk generalizes the UPB (k = 1) and
the UMEB (k = d). In order to study SUEBk, it is
useful to consider its matrix form. Let |φi be a pure
quantum states in HA ⊗ HB′ . Under the computational
bases {|iiA }di=1 and {|jiB }dj=1 , it can be expressed as
′

|φi =

d X
d
X
i=1 j=1

mφij |iiA |jiB .

We call the d × d′ matrix Mφ := (mφij ) the corresponding
matrix representation of |φi. The correspondence is good
in the following sense:
(1) Inner product preserving:
′

hψ|φi =

d X
d
X
i=1 j=1

φ
†
mψ
ij mij = Tr(Mψ Mφ ) = hMψ , Mφ i;

(2) Schmidt number corresponding to the matrix rank:
Sr (|φi) = rank(Mφ );
(3) Nonzero Schmidt coefficients corresponding to the
nonzero singular values.
With this correspondence, we can restate the concept
in definition 2 as follows.
Definition 2. A set of matrices {Mi }ni=1 (1 ≤ n ≤ dd′ −
1) in Matd×d′ (C) is called a special unextendible singular
√
values basis with nonzero singular values being {1/ k}
(SUSVBk) if
(1) hMi , Mj i = δij , i, j ∈ [n];
(2) The
√ nonzero singular values of Mi are all equal to
1/ k for each i ∈ [n];
(3) If hMi , M i = 0 for all i ∈ [n], then some
nonzero
√
singular value of M do not equal to 1/ k.
Due to the good correspondence of the states
and ma′
trices, {|ψi i}ni=1 is a set of SUEBk in Cd ⊗ Cd if and only
if {Mψi }ni=1 is a set of SUSVBk in Matd×d′ (C). Therefore, in order
to construct a set of n members SUEBk in
′
Cd ⊗ Cd , it is sufficient to construct a set of n members
SUSVBk in Matd×d′ (C).

STRATEGY FOR CONSTRUCTING
SUSVBK

Observation 1 – It is uneasy to calculate the singular
values of an arbitrary matrix. However, if there are only k

nonzero elements in M (say mi1 ,j1 , · · · , mik ,jk ) and these
elements happen to be in different rows and columns,
then there are exactly k nonzero singular values of M
and they are just |mi1 ,j1 |, · · · , |mik ,jk |. For example, let
M be

where w = e2π −1/3 . Then the nonzero singular values
of M are √12 , √13 , √112 , √124 , √124 .
Observation 2 – If there are exactly k nonzero singular values of M , then the rank of M is k. Therefore, if
one can prove that rank(M ) < k, then M cannot be a
matrix with k nonzero singular values.
With the two observations above, our strategy for constructing an n-members SUSVBk can be roughly described by two steps. Firstly, we construct a set of nmembers of orthnormal matrices M := {Mi }ni=1 such
that there are exactly
√ k nonzero elements in Mi whose
modulos are all 1/ k and these elements happen to be in
different rows and columns. Secondly, we need to show
that the rank of any matrix in the complementary space
of M (define as M⊥ := {M ∈ Matd×d′ (C)|hMi , M i =
0, ∀Mi ∈ M}) is less than k.
Let d, d′ be integers such that 2 ≤ d ≤ d′ . We define
the coordinate set to be
Cd×d′ := {(i, j) ∈ N2 |i ∈ [d], j ∈ [d′ ]}.
Now we define an order for the set Cd×d′ . Equivalently,
we can define a bijection:
Od×d′ : Cd×d′ −→ [dd′ ]


(j − i)d + i
if i ≤ j;
(i, j) 7−→
(d′ + j − i)d + i if i > j.
Then we call (Cd×d′ , Od×d′ ) an ordered set (See Fig. 1
for an example). We can also define an order Od×d′ for
the cases d′ ≤ d by Od×d′ := Od′ ×d .
Let (i1 , j1 ), (i2 , j2 ) be two different coordinates in
Cd×d′ . It is easy to check that if i1 = i2 or j1 = j2 ,
then Od×d′ [(i1 , j1 )] − Od×d′ [(i2 , j2 )] ≥ d − 1. Therefore,
any d − 1 consecutive coordinates in Cd×d′ under the order Od×d′ is coordinately different. That is, these d − 1
coordinates must come from different rows and different
columns.
Let P ⊆ Cd×d′ . Then P inherit an order O from that
of Cd×d′ (An order here means a bijective map from P
to [#P ] where #P to denote the number of elements in
the set P ). In fact, as #Od×d′ (P ) = #P , there is an

FIG. 1. This is a picture of the order O5×9 on the coordinate
set C5×9 . For examples, O5×9 [(3, 8)] = (8 − 3) × 5 + 3 = 28,
and O5×9 [(5, 2)] = (9 + 2 − 5) × 5 + 5 = 35.

unique map πP from the set Od×d′ (P ) to [#P ] which
preserve the order of the numbers. Then we define O :=
πP Od×d′ |P to be the order of P inherit from that of Cd×d′ .
For example, let P := {(1, 2), (4, 3), (5, 6)} ⊆ C5×9 . Then
the πP from the set {O5×9 [(1, 2)] = 6, O5×9 [(4, 3)] =
44, O5×9 [(5, 6)] = 10} to [3] = {1, 2, 3} is just defined
by: πP (6) = 1, πP (10) = 2, πP (44) = 3. Therefore, the
order O of P inherited from that of Cd×d′ is exactly the
map: O[(1, 2)] = 1, O[(5, 6)] = 2, O[(3, 4)] = 3.
In order to step forward, we first state the following
observation which is helpful for determine the orthogonality of matrices. Let P ⊆ Cd×d′ and denote O the order
of P inherit from the Od×d′ . l denotes the number of elements in P . As we have defined an order for the set
Cd×d′ , it reduces an order to its subset P . For any vector
v ∈ Cl , we define
X
vO[(i,j)] Ei,j
Md×d′ (P, v) :=
(i,j)∈P

where Ei,j denote the d×d′ matrix whose (i, j) coordinate
is 1 and zero elsewhere.
Lemma 1. Let P1 , P2 ⊆ Cd×d′ be nonempty sets and
v, w be vectors of dimensions #P1 and #P2 respectively.
Then we have the following statements.
(a) If P1 ∩ P2 = ∅, then we have
hMd×d′ (P1 , v), Md×d′ (P2 , w)i = 0.
(b) If P1 = P2 and v, w are orthogonal to each other,
then we also have
hMd×d′ (P1 , v), Md×d′ (P2 , w)i = 0.
Proof. Denote O1 and O2 the orders of P1 and P2 inherit
from the Od×d′ respectively.
(a) As

we have
hMd×d′ (P1 , v), Md×d′ (P2 , w)i
= Tr[Md×d′ (P1 , v)† Md×d′ (P2 , w)]

The last equality holds as the condition P1 ∩ P2 = ∅
implies δik δjl = 0.
(b) For the second part, we have the following equalities:
hMd×d′ (P1 , v), Md×d′ (P1 , w)i

Example 1. There exists a SUEB3 in C7 ⊗ C7 whose
cardinality is 47.
Proof. As 47 = 7 × 7 − 2, we define B47 to be the
set with 47 elements which can be obtained by deleting {(7, 1), (7, 2)} from C7×7 . We can define an order O
for the set B47 . In fact, the O is chosen to be the order
of B47 inherited from that of C7×7 (See the left figure of
Fig. 2 for an intuitive view). Any 5 consecutive elements
of B47 under the order O come from different rows and
columns. Firstly, we have the following identity
47 = 9 × 3 + 5 × 4.

(1)

Since there are 47 elements in the set B47 , by the decomposition (1), we can divide the set B47 into (9 + 5) sets:

4
9 sets (denote by Si , 1 ≤ i ≤ 9) of cardinality 3 and 5
sets (denote by Lj , 1 ≤ j ≤ 5) of cardinality 4. In fact,
we can divide B47 into these 14 sets through its order O.
That is,
Si := {O−1 [3(i − 1) + x]

x = 1, · · · , 3}, 1 ≤ i ≤ 9,

Lj := {O−1 [27 + 4(j − 1) + y] y = 1, · · · , 4}, 1 ≤ j ≤ 5.

the set Si , Lj . Set

where w = e 3 . We can easily check that CH3 CH†3 =
3I3 and O4 O4† = 3I4 . Now set vx to be the x-th row
of CH3 (x = 1, 2, 3) and wy to be the y-th row of O4
(y = 1, 2, 3, 4). So vx ∈ C3 and vy ∈ C4 . So we can
construct the following 9 × 3 + 5 × 4 = 47 matrices:
M7×7 (Si , √13 vx ), M7×7 (Lj , √13 wy ),
1 ≤ i ≤ 9, 1 ≤ x ≤ 3, 1 ≤ j ≤ 5, 1 ≤ y ≤ 4.
Let M to be the set of the above matrices. Note
that the elements of each Si or Lj are coordinately
different. Hence by Observation 1, the states correspond to the above N matrices belong to SES3. Since
CH3 CH†3 = 3I3 , v1 , v2 , v3 are pairwise orthogonal. Similarly, as O4 O4† = 3I4 , w1 , w2 , w3 , w4 are also pairwise orthogonal. And the s + t sets above are pairwise disjoint. Therefore, by Lemma 1, the 47 matrices above are pairwise orthogonal. Set V be the linear
space spaned by the matrices in M. Each matrix in
B⊥ := {Ei,j ∈ Mat7×7 (C)|(i, j) ∈ C7×7 \ B47 } is orthogonal to V . And the dimension of spanC (B⊥ ) is just 2.
Therefore, V ⊥ = spanC (B⊥ ). One should note that the
rank of any nonzeto matrix in spanC (B⊥ ) is 1. Such a
state cannot lie in SEB3. Therefore, the set of states
corresponding to the matrices M consists a SUEB3.

Definition 3 (See [20]). A generalized weighing matrix
is a square a × a matrix A all of whose non-zero entries
are n-th roots of unity such that AA† = kIa . It follows
that √1k A is a unitary matrix so that A† A = kIa and
every row and column of A has exactly k nonzero entries.
k is called the weight and n is called the order of A.
We denote W (n, k, a) the set of all weight k and order a
generalized weighing matrix whose nonzero entries being
n-th root.
One can find the following lemma via the theorem 2.1.1
on the book “The Diophantine Frobenius Problem” [21].
The related problem is also known as Frobenius coin
problem or coin problem.
Lemma 2 ([21]). Let a, b be positive integers and coprime. Then for every integer N ≥ (a − 1)(b − 1), there
are non-negative integers x, y such that N = xa + yb.
Theorem 1. Let k be a positive integer. Suppose there
exist a, b, m, n ∈ N such that W (m, k, a) and W (n, k, b)
are nonempty and gcd(a, b) = 1. If d, d′ are integers such
that d ≥ max{a, b} + k and d′ ≥ max{a, b} + 1, then for
any integer N ∈ [(d − k + 1)d′ , dd′ − 1], there exists a
′
SUEBk in Cd ⊗ Cd whose cardinality is exactly N .

Proof. Without loss of generality, we suppose a < b and
A ∈ W (m, k, a), B ∈ W (n, k, b). Let A1 , · · · , Aa be the
rows of A and B1 , · · · , Bb be the rows of B. Any integer
N ∈ [(d − k + 1)d′ , dd′ − 1] can be written uniquely as
N = d′ q + r where (d − k + 1) ≤ q ≤ d − 1 and r is an
integer with 0 ≤ r < d′ . Then we have a coordinate set
C(q+1)×d′ with order O(q+1)×d′ . Notice that any q consecutive elements of C(q+1)×d′ under the order O(q+1)×d′ are
coordinate different. Denote BN to be the set by deleting
the elements {(q + 1, i)|1 ≤ i ≤ d′ − r} from C(q+1)×d′ .
The subset BN inherit an order O from that of C(q+1)×d′ .
As O(q+1)×d′ [(q + 1, i)] − O(q+1)×d′ [(q + 1, j)] ≥ q for
any 1 ≤ i 6= j ≤ d′ , any q − 1 consecutive elements of
BN under the order O are coordinate different. Since
q − 1 ≥ d − k ≥ max{a, b}, any a or b consecutive elements of BN under the order O come from different rows

5
′

and columns. As N ≥ qd′ > (a − 1) × (b − 1), by Lemma
2, there exist nonnegative integers s, t such that

numbers varying from (d − k + 1)d′ to dd′ − 1 in Cd ⊗ Cd
whenever d ≥ 2k + 1 and d′ ≥ k + 2.

N = s × a + t × b.

Corollary 3. Let p1 , · · · , ps be different primes and k =
ms
1
pm
where m1 , · · · , ms are positive integers. If
1 · · · ps
mi
gcd(pi + 1, k) = 1 for each i = 1, · · · , s, Then there
exists some SUEBk with numbers varying from (d − k +

d ≥ k+ i=1 (pm
i +1)
Q

and d ≥ 2k + 1 and d ≥ 2 + i=1 (pi + 1).

(4)

Since there are N elements in the set BN , by the decomposition (6), we can divide the set BN into (s + t) sets: s
sets (denote by Si , 1 ≤ i ≤ s) of cardinality a and t sets
(denote by Lj , 1 ≤ j ≤ t) of cardinality b. In fact, we
can divide BN into these s + t sets through its order O.
That is,

V.

Si := {O−1 [(i − 1)a + x] x = 1, · · · , a}, 1 ≤ i ≤ s,

Lj := {O−1 [sa + (j − 1)b + y] y = 1, · · · , b}, 1 ≤ j ≤ t.
Then we can construct the following s × a + t × b = N
matrices:
{Md×d′ (Si , √1k Ax ), Md×d′ (Lj , √1k By )

SECOND TYPE OF SUEBK

In the following, we try to construct a set of matrices
M := {Mi }ni=1 which generates all the matrices of the left
of the following form. While its complementary space
M⊥ is the set of matrices of the right of the following
form where r + s < k.

1 ≤ i ≤ s, 1 ≤ x ≤ a, 1 ≤ j ≤ t, 1 ≤ y ≤ b.

Corollary 1. Let k be an integer such that W (n, k, k+1)
is nonempty for some integer n. Then there exists some
SUEBk with numbers varying from (d− k + 1)d′ to dd′ − 1
′
in Cd ⊗ Cd whenever d ≥ 2k + 1 and d′ ≥ k + 2.
We should notice that the weighing matrices have been
studied by lots of researchers [20, 22–27]. For example, there always exist some weighing matrix of the form
W (n, pm , pm + 1) whenever pm > 2 for all prime p. In
fact, Gerald Berman proved a much more strong result
than this [20].
Corollary 2. Let p be a prime and k = pm > 2 for some
positive integer m. Then there exists some SUEBk with

Noticing that CHk ∈ W (k, k, k) for all integer k ≥

corollary.

Let M to be the set of the above matrices. Note that
the (s+t) sets S1 , · · · , Ss , L1 · · · , Lt are pairwise disjoint.
And the rows of A (resp. B) are orthogonal to each other
as AA† = kIa (resp. BB † = kIb ). By Lemma 1, the
above sa + tb matrices are orthogonal to each other. By
construction, all the sets S1 . . . , Ss , L1 , · · · , Lt are all coordinately different. Using this fact and the definition of
generalized weighing matrices, the states corresponding
to these matrices are all belong to SESk (see Observation 1). Set V be the linear subspace of Matd×d′ (C).
Each matrix in B⊥ := {Ei,j ∈ Matd×d′ (C)|(i, j) ∈ Cd×d′ \
BN } is orthogonal to V . And the dimension of spanC (B⊥ )
is just dd′ − N . Therefore, V ⊥ = spanC (B⊥ ). One should
note that the rank of any matrix in spanC (B⊥ ) is less
than k. That is to say, any state orthogonal to the states
corresponding to M has Schmidt rank at most (k − 1).
Such a state cannot lie in SEB(k − 1). Therefore, the
set of states corresponding to the matrices M consists a
SUEBk.

FIG. 3. The left figure shows the order of subset of C8×9 .
While the right hand one shows the distribution of the short
and long states through this order.

Example 2. There exists a SUEB4 in C8 ⊗ C9 whose
cardinality is 54.
Proof. As 54 = 7 × 8 − 2, we can define B54 to be the
set with 54 elements which can be obtained by deleting
{(6, 8), (7, 8)} from C7×8 . Notice that any 6 consecutive
elements of C7×8 under the order O7×8 come from different rows and columns. Denote O as the order of B54 inherited from O7×8 . As O7×8 [(7, 8)] = 14, O7×8 [(6, 8)] =
20, any 5 consecutive elements of B54 under the order O
come from different rows and columns (See the left figure
of Fig. 3 for an intuitive view). We have the following

6
identity
54 = 6 × 4 + 6 × 4.

(5)

Since there are 54 elements in the set B54 , by the decomposition (5), we can divide the set B54 into (6 + 6) sets:
9 sets (denote by Si , 1 ≤ i ≤ 6) of cardinality 4 and 6
sets (denote by Lj , 1 ≤ j ≤ 6) of cardinality 6. In fact,
we can divide B54 into these 12 sets through its order O.
That is,
Si := {O−1 [4(i − 1) + x]

x = 1, · · · , 4}, 1 ≤ i ≤ 6,

for any N ∈ [m1 m2 , dd′ − 1], there exists a SUEBk in
′
Cd ⊗ Cd whose cardinality is exactly N .
Proof. Without loss of generality, we suppose a < b and
A ∈ W (m, k, a), B ∈ W (n, k, b). Let A1 , · · · , Aa be the
rows of A and B1 , · · · , Bb be the rows of B. We separate the interval [m1 m2 , dd′ ) into s + t pairwise disjoint
intervals:
[(m1 + i)m2 , (m1 + i + 1)m2 ), 0 ≤ i ≤ s − 1,
[d(m2 + j), d(m2 + j + 1)), 0 ≤ j ≤ r − 1.

Any integer N ∈ [m1 m2 , dd′ − 1] lies in one of the
y = 1, · · · , 5}, 1 ≤ j ≤ 6. above s + t intevals. Without loss of generality, we assume that N ∈ [(m1 + i0 )m2 , (m1 + i0 + 1)m2 ) for some
See the right hand side of Fig. 3 for an intuitive view of
i0 ∈ {0, · · · , s − 1}. Suppose N = (m1 + i0 )m2 + f,

N ≥ m1 m2 > (a − 1) × (b − 1), by Lemma 2, there exist
We can easily check that O5 O5 = 4I5 . Now set vx be the
nonnegative
integers s, t such that
x-th row of CH (x = 1, 2, 3, 4) and w be the y-th row
Lj := {O−1 [24 + 5(j − 1) + y]

y

of O5 (y = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). So vx ∈ C4 and vy ∈ C5 . So we
can construct the following 6 × 4 + 6 × 5 = 54 matrices:
M8×9 (Si , √13 vx ), M8×9 (Lj , √13 wy ),
1 ≤ i ≤ 6, 1 ≤ x ≤ 4, 1 ≤ j ≤ 6, 1 ≤ y ≤ 5.
Let M to be the set of the above matrices. Note
that the elements of each Si or Lj are coordinately
different. Hence by Observation 1, the states correspond to the above N matrices belong to SES4. Since
CH4 CH†4 = 4I4 , v1 , v2 , v3 , v4 are pairwise orthogonal.
Similarly, as O5 O5† = 4I5 , w1 , w2 , w3 , w4 , w5 are also
pairwise orthogonal. And the 12 sets above are pairwise disjoint. Therefore, by Lemma 1, the 54 matrices above are pairwise orthogonal. Set V be the linear
subspace of Mat8×9 (C). Each matrix in B⊥ := {Ei,j ∈
Mat8×9 (C)|(i, j) ∈ C8×9 \ B54 } is orthogonal to V . And
the dimension of spanC (B⊥ ) is just (72 − 54). Therefore, V ⊥ = spanC (B⊥ ). One should note that the rank of
any matrix in spanC (B⊥ ) is less than 4. That is to say,
any state orthogonal to the states corresponding to M
has Schmidt rank at most 3. Such a state cannot lie in
SEB3. Therefore, the set of states corresponding to the
matrices M consists a SUEB4.
Theorem 2. Let k be a positive integer. Suppose there
exist a, b, m, n ∈ N such that W (m, k, a) and W (n, k, b)
are nonempty and gcd(a, b) = 1. Let d, d′ be integers. If
there are decompositions d = m1 + s, d′ = m2 + r such
that m1 , m2 ≥ max{a, b} + 2 and 1 ≤ r + s < k. Then

N = s × a + t × b.

(6)

Since there are N elements in the set BN , by the decomposition (6), we can divide the set BN into (s + t) sets: s
sets (denote by Si , 1 ≤ i ≤ s) of cardinality a and t sets
(denote by Lj , 1 ≤ j ≤ t) of cardinality b. In fact, we
can divide BN into these s + t sets through its order O.
That is,
Si := {O−1 [(i − 1)a + x]

x = 1, · · · , a}, 1 ≤ i ≤ s,

Lj := {O−1 [sa + (j − 1)b + y] y = 1, · · · , b}, 1 ≤ j ≤ t.
Then we can construct the following s × a + t × b = N
matrices:
Md×d′ (Si , √1k Ax ), Md×d′ (Lj , √1k By )
1 ≤ i ≤ s, 1 ≤ x ≤ a, 1 ≤ j ≤ t, 1 ≤ y ≤ b.
Let M to be the set of the above matrices. Note that
the (s+t) sets S1 , · · · , Ss , L1 · · · , Lt are pairwise disjoint.
And the rows of A (resp. B) are orthogonal to each other
as AA† = kIa (resp. BB † = kIb ). By Lemma 1, the
above sa + tb matrices are orthogonal to each other. By
construction, all the sets S1 . . . , Ss , L1 , · · · , Lt are all coordinately different. Using this fact and the definition of
generalized weighing matrices, the states corresponding
to these matrices are all belong to SESk (see Observation 1). Set V be the linear subspace of Matd×d′ (C).
Each matrix in B⊥ := {Ei,j ∈ Matd×d′ (C)|(i, j) ∈
Cd×d′ \ BN } is orthogonal to V . And the dimension of

spanC (B⊥ ) is just dd′ − N . Therefore, V ⊥ = spanC (B⊥ ).
As r + s < k, so the rank of any matrix in spanC (B⊥ )
is less than k. That is to say, any state orthogonal to

from the main idea of the two kinds of constructions of
SUEBk.
Example 3. For any integer N ∈ [12, 19], there exists
a SUEB3 in C4 ⊗ C5 whose cardinality is exactly N (See

CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

We present a method to construct the special unextendible entangle basis of type k. The main idea here is
to decompose the whole space into two subspaces such
that the rank of one subspace easily bound by k and
the other can be generated by two kinds of the special
entangled states of type k. Here the two kinds of the
special entangled states of type k is related to a combinatoric concept which is known as weighing matrices.
This method is effective for k = pm ≥ 3. In these settings, we can obtain a series of SUEBk when the local
dimensions are large. In fact, based on two kinds of subspaces whose rank can be easily upper bounded by k, we
give two types of constructions of the SUEBks.
However, there are lots of unsolved cases. Find out
the largest linear subspace such that it do not contain
any scpecial entangled states of type k. This is related
to determine the minimal cardinality of possible SUEBk.
It is much more interesting to find some other methods
that can solve the general existence of SUEBk.

As application, the Theorem 2 give us that there is
some SUEB4 in C8 ⊗ C9 whose cardinality lies in [49, 71],
where a = 4, b = 5, m1 = 7, s = 1, m2 = 7, r = 2.
In fact, we may move further than the results showed in
Theorem 1 and Theorem 2. Here we present some exam-
