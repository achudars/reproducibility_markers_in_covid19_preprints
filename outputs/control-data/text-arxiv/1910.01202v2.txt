PLANE POLAR CREMONA MAPS OF ARBITRARILY LARGE
DEGREE IN POSITIVE CHARACTERISTIC
RÉMI BIGNALET-CAZALET
Abstract. A result of I.V. Dolgachev states that the complex homaloidal
polynomials in three variables, i.e. the complex homogeneous polynomials
whose polar map is birational, are of degree at most three. In this note we
describe homaloidal polynomials in three variables of arbitrarily large degree
in positive characteristic. Using combinatorial arguments, we also classify line
arrangements whose polar map is homaloidal in positive characteristic.

Introduction
Given a homogeneous polynomial f ∈ k[x0 , . . . , xm ] over a field k, the polar map

and Φf is birational.
It was established by I.V. Dolgachev [Dol00, Theorem 4] that if k = C, the
homaloidal polynomials in three variables are either of degree 2, defining a smooth
conic in the projective plane, or of degree 3, defining either a union of three lines
in general position or a union of a smooth conic with one of its tangents. These
polynomials remain homaloidal when the base field k has characteristic greater
than 2. This leads to the following question which is a generalisation of [DHS12,
Question 3.7].
Problem 1. Over a field k of positive characteristic, are there other homaloidal
polynomials than the ones in Dolgachev’s classification?
In [BC18, Proposition 4.6], a first example of a homaloidal polynomial of degree
5 over a field of characteristic 3 was produced, answering both Problem 1 and
[DHS12, Question 3.7]. Very recently, the following example of a homaloidal curve
of degree 5 in characteristic 3 was also described.
Example 2. In characteristic 3, the polynomial f = x0 (x21 + x0 x2 )(2x21 + x0 x2 ),
whose zero locus is the union of two conics intersecting with multiplicity two in two
distinct points with the tangent at one intersection point, is homaloidal.
The negative answer to Problem 1 leads to the following question.

Problem 3. Does there exist homaloidal polynomials in three variables of arbitrary
large degree over fields of arbitrarily large characteristic?
In this note, we answer this question, see Theorem 2.4 for our expanded result.
Following the designation in [Hir83] we say that a union of n distinct lines through a
given point z0 with another line not passing through z0 is a near-pencil arrangement
of n + 1 lines. In addition, given a reduced projective curve F = V(f ) which is the
zero locus V(f ) in P2k of a homogeneous polynomial f , we say that F is homaloidal
if f is homaloidal.
Theorem A. Let k be a field of characteristic p and let n ∈ N>0 be a multiple of
p. Then the near-pencil arrangement of n + 1 lines is homaloidal.
This result provides an answer to Problem 3. For instance, let n ∈ N>0 be such
that n ≡ 0 mod 5 and let k be a field of characteristic 5. Then the polynomial fn in
Theorem A has degree n + 1 and is homaloidal. Moreover, given a prime number p,
a field k of characteristic p and a positive integer m, Theorem A gives a homaloidal
polynomial of degree mp + 1, so homaloidal polynomials exist in arbitrarily large
degree and in any prime characteristic.
Remark that the base ideal of the polar map Φf , i.e. the ideal generated by
the partial derivatives of a polynomial f defines the singular locus of the curve
V(f ) defined by f in P2k . In this direction, the proof given by I.V.Dolgachev about
the classification of homaloidal complex polynomials relies on the Jung-Milnor’s
formula over C relating several invariants of singularities [Dol00, Lemma 3]. In
contrast, our proof of Theorem A relies on the study of the torsion of the symmetric
algebra of the base ideal of Φf , an approach that fits in line with previous works
such as [RS01], [DHS12], and [BC18]. We emphasize that most of the polynomials
we consider in this note define free curves (a curve being free if, by definition, the
base ideal of the polar map is determinantal [Dim17a, Def 2.1]). We specially focus
on this case since, when the base ideal has a linear syzygy, free curves are the curves
whose singular schemes have maximal length [Dim17a, Cor 1.2].
Contents of the paper. In the first section, we recall the relations between the
symmetric algebra of the base ideal of a rational map Φ and the graph of Φ. Birationality of a map can be checked via its graph which explains the strategy of
detecting a birational map via the symmetric algebra of its base ideal.
The second section constitutes the heart of our work. As a central idea, one can
study the reduction modulo p of the presentation matrix of the base ideal in order
to predict a drop of the topological degree of the polar map, see Subsection 2.1. The
next step is then to evaluate this drop. We carry on this evaluation by describing
the generic fibre of the naive graph and thus describing the generic fibre of the
graph itself. This implies in particular that the polynomials fn are homaloidal
(Lemma 2.3). We end this section by providing another example of a polynomial of
degree 5 which is homaloidal in characteristic 3. Its zero locus in P2k is the union of
the unicuspidal ramphoı̈d quartic and the tangent cone at its cusp (Example 2.6).
In the third section, we focus on line arrangements (that is plane curves which
are union of lines) and we show that, over an algebraically closed field of characteristic p > 0, the only homaloidal line arrangements are the ones defining unions of
three general lines or near-pencil of lp + 1 lines for any l > 1, see Proposition 3.1.
This classification follows from the description of the singularities defined by line
arrangements.

1. Graph and naive graph
In this note, all the fields are assumed to be algebraically closed and denoted by
the same letter k.
1.1. Multidegree of a subscheme of P2 × P2 , projective degrees. For this
presentation, we follow [Dol11, 7.1]. Given l ∈ {0, 1, 2}, we denote by H l a general
codimension l linear subspace of P2k . For a subscheme X ⊂ P2k × P2k of codimension
2, the multidegree d0 (X), d1 (X), d2 (X) is defined by :

−1
2−i
i
)
(1.1)
di (X) = length X ∩ p−1
1 (H ) ∩ p2 (H

where p1 : P2k × P2k → P2k and p2 : P2k × P2k → P2k are the first and second projection
respectively.
Consider now a rational map Φ = (φ0 : φ1 : φ2 ) : P2k 99K P2k with base ideal
I = (φ0 , φ1 , φ2 ) ⊂ R = k[x0 , x1 , x2 ] where φ0 , φ1 , φ2 are homogeneous polynomials
of the same degree that do not share any common factor. The graph Γ of Φ is by
definition the closure of {(x, Φ(x)), x ∈ P2k \V(I)} ⊂ P2k × P2k in the Zariski topology. It is an irreducible
variety of codimension 2. We define the projective degrees


d0 (Φ), d1 (Φ), d2 (Φ) of Φ as the terms in the multidegree d0 (Γ), d1 (Γ), d2 (Γ) of
Γ.
Since Φ is birational if and only if d0 (Φ) = 1, this last quantity has a special
importance and is called the topological degree of Φ.
1.2. Decomposition of the naive graph. Let Φ = (φ0 : φ1 : φ2 ) : P2k 99K P2k
be a rational map with base ideal I = (φ0 , φ1 , φ2 ) in the coordinate ring R =
i i
k[x0 , x1 , x2 ] of P2k and let R(I) := ⊕i≥0
 I t 2⊂ R[t] be the Rees algebra of I. By
[Dol00, 7.1.3] the blow-up Proj R(I) of Pk with respect to I is the graph Γ of
Φ. Moreover, R(I) is the epimorphic image of the symmetric algebra S(I) of I
2
2
via the epimorphisms I ⊗i ։ I i . Hence,
 the2ideal2 of the graph Γ ⊂ Pk × Pk of Φ
contains the ideal of P(I) = Proj S(I) ⊂ Pk × Pk generated by the entries of the
matrix y0 y1 y2 MS where S = R[y0 , y1 , y2 ] stands for the coordinate ring of
P2k × P2k and MS stands for a presentation matrix of I ⊂ R tensored with S [BC18,
Subsection 1.1] (note that we use the same notation M and MS from now on). The
ideal I is said to be of linear type if Γ = P(I) [Vas05, 1.1 Ideals of linear type].

Definition 1.1. The naive graph of Φ is the projectivization P(I) = Proj S(I)
of the symmetric algebra of I.

Example 1.2. Let Φ = (φ0 : φ1 : φ2 ) : P2k 99K P2k be a dominant rational map with
base ideal I = (φ0 , φ1 , φ2 ) ⊂ k[x0 , x1 , x2 ] of height at least 2 and where φ0 , φ1 , φ2
have the same degree d. Note that, in this setting, the condition height(I) ≥ 2 is
equivalent to the fact that (φ0 , φ1 , φ2 ) do not share any common factor, a property

4

which we always assume in the following. Assume moreover that Φ is determinantal,
i.e. that the polynomials φ0 , φ1 , φ2 are the 2-minors of a given 3 × 2-matrix such
that all its entries in the first column are homogeneous of degree a and all its entries
in the second column are homogeneous of degree b (hence a + b = d). The HilbertBurch theorem [Eis95, Theorem 20.15] implies that I has a free resolution of the
form:
0

R2

M

R3

(φ0 φ1 φ2 )

I

0.

where M is a 3 × 2-matrix with entries in R. Hence M is a presentation matrix of
I and P(I) is the intersection of two divisors of P2k × P2k of bidegree (a, 1) and (b, 1)
respectively. Considering the case where I is of linear type, since Γ has codimension
2, P(I) = Γ is a complete intersection and the projective degrees of Φ are given by
Bézout’s theorem:


 d0 (Φ) = d0 (P(I)) = ab
(1.2)
d1 (Φ) = d1 (P(I)) = a + b


d2 (Φ) = d2 (P(I)) = 1.
Assume that Φ : P2k 99K P2k is a determinantal rational map with base ideal
I ⊂ R = k[x0 , x1 , x2 ] of height 2 and denote by M the 3 × 2-presentation matrix of
I. Then the complement subscheme T = P(I)\Γ of Γ in P(I) is supported on
[
(1.3)
{x} × P2k

x∈V Fitt2 (I)

where Fitt2 (I) is the second Fitting ideal of I [Eis95, Corollary-Definition 20.4], by
definition generated by the entries of M , see [BC18, Corollary 1.4] for a reference.
Definition 1.3. Let Φ = (φ0 : φ1 : φ2 ) : P2k 99K P2k be a determinantal rational map with base ideal I = (φ0 , φ1 , φ2 ) of height 2. The naive projective degrees
d0 (Φ), d1 (Φ), d2 (Φ) of Φ are defined by the multidegree d0 (P(I)), d1 (P(I)), d2 (P(I))
of its naive graph P(I).
Example 1.4. If I is not necessarily of linear type in Example 1.2, we still have
that the naive projective degree of Φ are (ab, a+b, 1) because P(I) is still a complete
intersection. However, if there is an extra part T = P(I)\Γ in P(I) with support
as in (1.3), we have then



d0 (P(I)), d1 (P(I)), d2 (P(I)) = d0 (Γ), d1 (Γ), d2 (Γ) + d0 (T), d1 (T), d2 (T) .
So the topologicaldegree d0 (Φ) is strictly smaller than d0 (Φ) because d0 (T) ≥
length V Fitt2 (I) is non zero. The quantity d0 (Γ) = d0 (P(I)) − d0 (T) depends
moreover on the scheme structure of T and is the object of Subsection 2.2.
2. Contribution of the torsion
In this section, following the situation described in Example 1.4, we illustrate
first on an example how to estimate the drop of the topological degree in positive
characteristic compared to characteristic 0. We analyse then in greater generality
how this modification impacts the computation of the topological degree of Φ.

2.1. Reduction of the presentation matrix modulo p. In what follows, for
a homogeneous ideal I of R = k[x0 , x1 , x2 ] and an integer t, we denote by It the
homogeneous piece of I of degree t. Let n ∈ N>1 and let Fn be the union of n
distinct lines through a point z0 ∈ P2k with any other line not passing through z0 .
We can reduce to the situation where V(x2 ) is the latter line and two lines among the
nth firsts are V(x0 ) and V(x1 ) so that z0 = (0 : 0 : 1). We can consequently assume
without loss of generality that an equation of Fn reads fn = x0 x1 l2 · · · ln−1 x2 where,
for all i ∈ {2, . . . , n − 1}, li belongs to (x0 , x1 )1 (set fn = x0 x1 x2 if n = 2). The
ideal I of partial derivatives of fn is then equals to
∂
(l2 · · · ln−1 )x2 ,
∂x0
∂
x0 l2 · · · ln−1 x2 + x0 x1
(l2 · · · ln−1 )x2 , x0 x1 l2 · · · ln−1 ).
∂x1

I = (x1 l2 · · · ln−1 x2 +x0 x1

Proof. The ideal I has depth 2 for otherwise the first two generators of I would
be divisible by either x0 , x1 or li for i ∈ {2, . . . , n − 1} which is excluded by the
assumption that all the lines in Fn are distinct. A direct computation shows that


where, given j ∈ {1, 2, 3}, Mj stands for (−1)j times the minor obtained from M
by leaving out the j th row (in order to check these equalities, remark that, for any
∂li
i
i ∈ {2, . . . , n − 1}, li = x0 ∂l
x0 + x1 x1 ). Hence I is a determinantal ideal given by
the 2-minors of M . Since it has the expected depth, the Hilbert-Burch theorem
asserts that a free resolution of I reads:

Moreover, since it does not have constant entries, M is a minimal presentation
matrix of I.

Proposition 2.2. Let n ∈ N>1 and k be an algebraically closed field such that
p = char(k) does not divide n. Then I is of linear type and the polar map Φfn of
fn has multidegree (n − 1, n, 1).
Proof. Since M has one column of linear entries and one column of entries of degree
n, the naive multidegree is (n − 1, n, 1), see Example 1.2. Moreover Fitt2 (I) =
(x0 , x1 , x2 ) is not supported on any point of P2k so, by (1.3), I is of linear type.
Hence the graph Γ and the naive graph P(I) coincide, so the projective degrees and

the naive projective degrees of Φfn coincide.
We consider now the case where char(k) divides n in a more general situation.

2.2. Weight of the torsion. In all the section, we put n ∈ N>1 , k be any field
unless otherwise specified, R = k[x0 , x1 , x2 ] and we consider the ideal I generated
by the 2-minors of the matrix


λ0 p0
M = λ1 p1 
λ2 p2
with entries in R = k[x0 , x1 , x2 ] such that for all j ∈ {0, 1, 2}, λj belongs to (x0 , x1 )1
n−2
and pj belongs to (x0 , x1 )n−1
, the homogeneous piece of degree n − 1 of the ideal
n−2
(x0 , x1 )
. We assume moreover that I has height 2 and that there exists j ∈
n−2
n−1
{0, 1, 2} such that pj ∈ (x0 , x1 )n−1
\(x0 , x1 )n−1
.
In S = R[y0 , y1 , y2 ], consider now the ideal
IP(I) = (λ0 y0 + λ1 y1 + λ2 y2 , y0 p0 + y1 p1 + y2 p2 )
of the embedding of P(I) in P2x × P2y generated by the entries of the matrix

y0 y1 y2 M . Following the computation in Example 1.2, P(I) being a complete intersection of two divisors of bidegree (1, 1) and (n − 1, 1), one has

d0 (P(I)), d1 (P(I)), (d2 (P(I)) = (n − 1, n, 1).
p
Moreover since all the entries of M are in the ideal (x0 , x1 ), the radical Fitt2 (I)
of the ideal Fitt2 (I) of entries of M is contained in (x0 , x1 ). Actually, since I
has height 2 and the polynomials in the first column of M are linear in x0 and
x1 one has Fitt2 (I) = (x0 , x1 ). Hence, as previously stated in (1.3), the naive
graph P(I) = V(IP(I) ) ⊂ P2x × P2y is the union of a torsion part T supported on
V(x0 , x1 ) = {(0 : 0 : 1)} × P2k , and of the graph Γ = P(I)\V(x0 , x1 ) of the map Φ
whose base ideal is by the 2-minors ideal I of M . The next result is a consequence
of [BCRD20, Theorem 5.14] but we will give a self-contained proof.
Lemma 2.3. Under the previous conditions on M , the torsion component T of
P(I) has multidegree (n − 2, 0, 0) and the graph Γ of Φ has multidegree (1, n, 1).

Proof. We analyse separately each element of the multidegree d0 (Γ), d1 (Γ), d2 (Γ) .
• Case i = 2. Take a general point y ∈ P2k as the intersection of two general
lines H1 , H2 of P2k and consider the intersection
−1
2
P(I)y = P(I) ∩ p−1
2 (H1 ) ∩ p2 (H2 ) ⊂ Py .

Under our assumptions, this intersection is a complete intersection of a
line and a curve of degree n − 1 in P2y . Moreover, since λj ∈ (x0 , x1 )1
for all j ∈ {0, 1, 2} and since there exists j ∈ {0, 1, 2} such that pj ∈
n−2
n−1
(x0 , x1 )n−1
\(x0 , x1 )n−1
, this complete intersection decomposes as the union
of the point V(x0 , x1 )y ∈ P2y with multiplicity n − 2 and of another point
with multiplicity 1. By the generality assumption on y, we can assume
that the subscheme P(I) ∩ P2y is defined by the ideal x1 , x0n−2 (x0 + α)
for some α ∈ k\{0}. Since Γ = P(I)\V(x0 , x1 ) is defined by the saturation
[IP(I) : (x0 : x1 )∞ ] of the ideal IP(I) of P(I) by the ideal (x0 , x1 ) = Fitt2 (I),
see (1.3), the only points of P2k over which the fibre of P(I) contributes to
d0 (Γ) are those different from V(x0 , x1 ). Thus the other point is the only

element in Γ ∩ p−1
2 (H1 ) ∩ p2 (H2 ). Hence

and
d0 (T) = d0 (P(I)) − d0 (Γ) = n − 2.
• Case i = 1. Since I has height 2, the linear system defined by the 2-minors
of M does not have fixed components so d1 (Γ) = d1 (P(I)) = n and thus
d1 (T) = 0.
• Case i = 0. The torsion component T being supported over V(x0 , x1 ), the
−1
intersection T ∩ p−1
1 (H1 ) ∩ p1 (H2 ) of T with inverse images of general lines
2
in Pk is empty so d2 (T) = 0 and d2 (Γ) = d2 (P(I)) − d2 (T) = 1.
To sum up, T has multidegree (n − 2, 0, 0) and Γ has multidegree
(n − 1, n, 1) − (n − 2, 0, 0) = (1, n, 1).

We have the following extension of Theorem A.
Theorem 2.4.
(1) Let n ∈ N>1 and assume that p = char k divides n, then
the near-pencil arrangements of n + 1 lines is homaloidal.
(2) Let n ∈ N>1 and assume that p = char k divides n(n− 1)− 1, then the curve
Gn = V x0 x1 (x1n−1 + x0n−2 x2 ) is homaloidal.
Proof.

(1) By Lemma 2.1, a presentation matrix of the ideal I of partial derivatives of fn verifies the conditions of Lemma 2.3. Hence Φfn is birational and
since the associated linear system has no fixed component, the polynomial
fn is homaloidal.
(2) Let n ∈ N>1 . The ideal
I = (xn1 + (n − 1)x0n−2 x1 x2 , nx0 x1n−1 + x0n−1 x2 , x0n−1 x1 )
of partial derivatives of gn = x0 x1 (x1n−1 + x0n−2 x2 ) has presentation matrix

where given j ∈ {1, 2, 3}, Mj is equal to (−1)j times the minor obtained
from M by leaving out the j th row. Hence I is a determinantal ideal and, by
application of Hilbert-Burch theorem, M is a minimal presentation matrix
of I. Now, if p divides n(n − 1) − 1, the matrix M verifies the conditions
of Lemma 2.3. So, in this case, Φgn is birational and gn is homaloidal.

Remark 2.5. The method of reduction modulo p we just described also
 applies to
Example 2 and to the quintic Q5 = V x0 (x21 + x0 x2 )(x21 + x0 x2 + x20 ) described in

2.3. Limits and perspectives. The fact that the presentation matrix of the jacobian ideal reduces well modulo p does not always occur, as illustrated by the
following example.
Example 2.6. Let h = x2 (x41 − 2x0 x21 x2 + x20 x22 − x1 x32 ) ∈ k[x0 , x1 , x2 ]. Its zero
locus in P2k is the union of the unicuspidal ramphoı̈d quartic with the tangent cone
at its cusp, see [Moe08]. Over a field k of characteristic 0, a computation with
Macaulay2 shows that a presentation matrix of the ideal of partial derivatives of
h reads:


15x21 + 3x0 x2 72x0 x1 + 15x22

8x1 x2
2x21 + 30x0 x2  .

−2x2
−8x1 x2
We can a priori not expect to apply Lemma 2.3 after reduction modulo p. However,
after reducing modulo 3, a presentation matrix of the reduction of I modulo 3 reads


0
x31 − x0 x1 x2 − x32
 x1
.
x0 x22
2
−x2
−x1 x2
This implies that the polar map of h is birational by Lemma 2.3 (here, remark that
the torsion is supported on V(x1 , x2 ) and that the maximal power of x0 is 1 is the
second column). By application of Hilbert-Burch theorem, we also have that the
induced linear system does not have fix components so h is actually homaloidal.
Remark 2.7. As pointed out by Example 2.6 and Item (2) of Theorem 2.4, the
classification of homaloidal plane curves in any characteristic seems to be a challenging problem, especially by only looking to the reduction modulo p of the syzygies of
the jacobian ideal. One can however restrict first to the classification of homaloidal
line arrangements and this is the object of next section.
3. Classification of homaloidal line arrangements in positive
characteristic
As a guideline for the section, let us state first our result about the classification
of homaloidal line arrangements.
Proposition 3.1. Given an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p > 0, the
only homaloidal line arrangements are:
(i) the union of three general lines,
(ii) the near-pencils of n + 1 lines where p divides n.
Our proof of Proposition 3.1 mainly relies on the observation that, as far as
the topological degree of the polar map of an arrangement is concerned, the only
quantity to consider is the numbers of lines defining the singularities of the arrangement. More precisely, a singularity z of a line arrangement A = V(f ) being the
intersection of r > 2 lines of A, the numerical contribution of z in the computation of d0 (Φf ) only depends on whether the characteristic p divides r or not, see
Lemma 3.2 for the precise result. Given this fact, the proof of Proposition 3.1 aims
to characterize combinatorially near-pencils of p + 1 lines among all arrangements
of p + 1 lines and this combinatorial characterization follows from [dBE48, Th.1].
In the following, given an integer d > 4, we let f = l1 · · · ld be the product of d
homogeneous linear polynomials l1 , . . . , ld ∈ k[x0 , x1 , x2 ] and A = V(f ) be the line
arrangement defined by f . Moreover, using the designation in [Hir83], a point z in

the singular locus of A which is the intersection point of r lines is called a r-fold
point.
The field k being algebraically closed, the topological degree d0 (Φf ) of Φf is the
degree of the fiber of a generic point of P2 , that is:
d0 (Φf ) = deg V(I g : I ∞ )

and I g : I ∞ stands for the saturation ideal of I g by I, see [Dol11, 7.1.3] for this
computation of the topological degree. Since V(I g : I ∞ ) is set-theoretically equal
to V(I g )\V(I), one has thus:
X
mz
(3.1)
d0 (Φf ) = (d − 1)2 −
z∈V(I)

where mz is the multiplicity of z in the scheme V(I g ) (note that this latter expression of d0 (Φf ) is true for any reduced plane curve V(f ) and not only for line
arrangements). Over the field of complex numbers C, by [Dim17b, 4.2], given an
r-fold point z ∈ V(I) one has
mz = µf,z = (r − 1)2
where µf,z stands for the local Milnor number of A at z, see [Dim17b, Definition
2.17] for the definition of Milnor numbers. Over a field of positive characteristic,
the relation between d0 (Φf ) and Milnor numbers of the singularities of A is much
blurred, in particular because Milnor number is not an invariant under contact
equivalence anymore (see [HRS19] for the definition of contact equivalence and
more precision about the definition of Milnor number in positive characteristic).
In other words, over a field k of positive characteristic, Equation (3.1) is still valid
by definition but the numbers mz cannot be interpreted as the Milnors numbers of
the singularities defined by f (even if we won’t need it, let us however precise that
the numbers mz appeared to be related to the Milnor number of a hypersurface
µ(Of ), a contact equivalent invariant defined in [HRS19, end of section 3]. We also
point out that typical behaviors of singularities in positive characteristic prevent
the classification of homaloidal polynomials via Dolgachev’s approach in [Dol00,
Lemma 3] over C, see [MHW01] and [Ngu16] for instances of such behaviors when
reducing modulo p).
Lemma 3.2. Let p = char(k) and z an r-fold point of a line arrangement A =
V(f ), f = l1 · · · ld . Denote by mz the multiplicity of z in V(I g ) as in Equation (3.1):
(1) if p divides r, then mz = (r − 1)2 + (r − 2),
(2) if p does not divide r, then mz = (r − 1)2 .
Proof. To describe mz , we first explain why it is enough to make the computation
in the case that A is a near-pencil of r + 1 lines such that z is the intersection point
of r lines. Once we have our local model for z, we use Theorem 2.4 to compute mz .
Let A = V(f ), f = l1 · · · ld , write z = (0 : 0 : 1) by choosing coordinates of P2k
and label the linear polynomials l1 , . . . , ld defining A such that l1 , . . . , lr ∈ (x0 , x1 )
and lr+1 , . . . , ld ∈ (x0 , x1 )c , (x0 , x1 )c being the complementary of the ideal (x0 , x1 ).

∈
(x0 , x1 )c and (a′ : b′ : c′ ), (α′ : β ′ : γ ′ ) are generic in P2k .
Hence, to compute the multiplicity mz of the component supported at the r-fold
point z = (0 : 0 : 1) of V(I g ), it is enough to consider that z is the r-fold point of
a near-pencil of r + 1 lines.
We treat now the case r = 2. The near-pencil A′ = V(l1 l2 l3 ) has three singular
point z, z2 , z3 and is always homaloidal, thus:

d0 (Φl1 l2 l3 ) = 4 − mz − m2 − m3 = 1
and since mz , m2 , m3 > 1, one has thus mz = m2 = m2 = 1. This ends the proof
of Lemma 3.2 in the case r = 2 whether p = 2 or not.
Consider now the case r > 2. Put A′ = V(f ′ ) for the near-pencil of r + 1 lines:
(1) By Theorem 2.4, if p|r, then
d0 (Φf ′ ) = r2 − mz −

r

mz i = 1

where z1 , . . . , zn are the r singularities defined by the intersection of the
r lines of the pencil and the other extra line. These r singularities are all
2-fold points so, from the case r = 2, mzi = 1 for all i = 1, . . . , r and
mz = r2 − r − 1 = (r − 1)2 + (r − 2).
(2) If p ∤ r, then d0 (Φf ′ ) = r − 1 by Proposition 2.2 (case n = r of Proposition 2.2). Hence
d0 (Φf ′ ) = r2 − mz −

r

mz i = r − 1

where z1 , . . . , zn are the r singularities defined by the intersection of the r
lines of the pencil and the other extra line. As in the previous case mzi = 1
for all i = 1, . . . , r so mz = (r − 1)2 .

Proof of Proposition 3.1. As it is stated at the beginning of [Hir83], given any line
arrangement A = V(f ) of d lines, one has the combinatorial identity:
d

d(d − 1) X r(r − 1)
=
tr

r=2
where tr is the number of r-fold point defined by A. This identity can be re-write
as:

tr (r − 1)2 −
tr (r − 2) = 1 + ( tr − d)

Hence, assuming that the characteristic p of k divides all r > 3 such that tr 6= 0,
one has by Lemma 3.2:
d

d0 (Φf ) = 1 + ( tr − d).
r=2

Remark that a near-pencils of d lines verifies

tr = d so, if p divides all r > 3

r=2

such that tr 6= 0, showing Proposition 3.1 aims to show that the identity

tr = d

r=2

characterizes near-pencils of d lines among all arrangements of d lines and this fact
is established in [dBE48, Theorem 1] (see also [Beu95, Theorem 5.1] for a more
recent treatment).
In case p does not divide at least one r > 3 such that tr 6= 0, then by Item (2)
of Lemma 3.2, Equation (3.2) implies that d0 (Φf ) > 1 so f is not homaloidal. 
