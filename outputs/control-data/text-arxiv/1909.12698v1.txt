Polymer based stereolithographic additive manufacturing has been established for the rapid and low-cost fabrication of
THz optical components due to its ability to construct complex 3D geometries with high resolution. For polymer based
or integrated optics, thermal annealing processes are often used to optimize material properties. However, despite the
growing interest in THz optics fabricated using stereolithography, the effects of thermal annealing on the THz dielectric
properties of polymethacrylates compatible with stereolithography has not been studied yet. In this manuscript we
report on the THz ellipsometric response of thermally annealed polymethacrylates prepared using UV polymerization.
Our findings indicate that the investigated polymethacrylate maintain a stable optical response in THz spectral range
from 650 to 950 GHz after thermal annealing at temperatures up to 70 ◦ C for several hours.

INTRODUCTION

Fabrication of THz optical components using additive manufacturing methods has been reported as an efficient alternative to long established fabrication routes using molding
or single-point diamond machining, for instance.1–3 Fabrication of THz optical components using additive manufacturing methods has been reported as an efficient alternative to
long established fabrication routes using molding or singlepoint diamond machining, for instance.1–3 THz optical components have been primarily fabricated using fused filament
deposition, which allows the deposition of a wide range of
THz transparent materials. The main advantage of fused filament deposition is the lower instrument and material cost.
However, fused filament deposition suffers from a low spatial
resolution and surface finish, which is mainly caused by the
nozzle diameter.4 Stereolithography, on the other hand, has
been reported to accomplish spatial resolutions on the order
of 10 µ m. In addition, the surface finish of components fabricated by stereolithography is substantially better compared to
other additive manufacturing fabrication techniques.5,6
Recently, metalization of stereolithographically fabricated
parts was demonstrated to be an effective way of prototyping reflective THz optics.7,8 Furthermore, polymers compatible with stereolithography were found to be transparent in THz spectral range to potentially enable the fabrication of transmissive optics.9 Thus, stereolithographic fabrication may open up new pathways for the manufacturing
of polymethacrylate-based or integrated THz optical components.
Polymers are known to undergo morphological changes
when heated to temperatures below the melting point, or
annealed.10 Morphological changes are often accompanied by
alterations in mechanical and optical properties. Therefore
heat-treatment-induced morphological changes have been
used to modify optical and mechanical material properties

for integrated optics such as fiber Bragg gratings11,12 and
polymer-based solar cells, for instance.13,14 Thus, the thermal
stability of polymers is an important aspect to consider when
designing an optical component to ensure its performance.
However, while thermally induced changes in the mechanical properties of various polymers including PMMA, polycarbonate, and polystyrene, for instance, are well investigated,
information on thermal effects in the THz optical properties is
still scarce.10,15,16
In this paper, we sought to investigate THz optical response
of bulk polymethacrylates subjected to annealing processes.
A common polymethacrylate that is compatible with a stereolithographic fabrication has been selected for this investigation. THz spectroscopic ellipsometry was performed before
and after the annealing processes. The polymethacrylate studied here was found to maintain its ellipsometric response in
the THz spectral range after annealing at moderate temperature of up to 70 ◦ C. Experimental and best-model calculated
THz cos(2Ψ) and sin(2Ψ) cos(∆) spectra are presented. A
parametrized model dielectric function composed of oscillators with Gaussian broadening was used for the data analysis
and is discussed here.

Sample Preparation

The samples studied here were prepared using UV-induced
polymerization of the “black” resin available from Formlabs
Inc. For each sample, approximately 2 ml of resin was applied
in between two microscope slides positioned parallel to each
other on a glass plate. Subsequently, a second glass plate was
set on top of the spacers to shape the resin into a thin slab.
The assembly was then placed in a UV oven (UVO cleaner
model no. 42, Jelight Company Inc.) and was cured for 15
minutes until the resin was fully polymerized. As a result,
the finished sample has parallel interfaces with low surface
roughness and is suitable for accurate ellipsometric measurements in the THz spectral range. The expected interference

oscillations in the THz spectral range due to the plain parallel interfaces will aid in the detection of small changes in
the dielectric function, which is a well known interference enhancement approach and frequently used in the visible spectral range.17 The same procedure was applied to create a total
of three identical samples. Once UV polymerized, two samples were thermally annealed in a precision oven at 70 ◦ C for
two different lengths of time, 2 and 4 hours, respectively. For
comparison, one sample was not thermally annealed and investigated as a reference.

The thermally annealed polymethacrylate samples were investigated using a custom-built THz spectroscopic ellipsometer system, which is described in detail in Ref. 18. The ellipsometer employs a rotating analyzer configuration (polarizer
− sample − rotating analyzer). The instrument is equipped
with a backward-wave oscillator source operating in a spectral range from 97 to 179 GHz, which can be extended up to
1010 GHz using GaAs Schottky diode frequency multipliers.
A Golay cell was used as a detector. Ellipsometric cos(2Ψ)
and sin(2Ψ) cos(∆) spectra were obtained over range from
650 to 950 GHz with a resolution of 5 GHz at two incidence
angles: Φa = 70◦ and 75◦ .
The un-annealed reference sample was investigated over a
wider spectral range using a commercial infrared ellipsometer (Mark I IR-VASE R , J.A. Woollam Company Inc.) and
a commercial THz ellipsometer (THz-VASE, J.A. Woollam
Company Inc.). The IR ellipsometer operates in a polarizer
− sample − rotating compensator − analyzer configuration,
while the THz ellipsometer uses a rotating polarizer − sample
− rotating compensator − analyzer configuration as detailed
in Ref. 19.
Ellipsometric cos(2Ψ) and sin(2Ψ) cos(∆) spectra were obtained in the infrared spectral range from 300 to 4000 cm−1
(9 to 120 THz) with a resolution of 4 cm−1 (0.1 THz) at
three angles of incidence: Φa = 65◦ , 70◦ , and 75◦. The
THz ellipsometric data were obtained over the range from
22 to 32 cm−1 (0.65 to 0.95 THz) with a resolution of
0.2 cm−1 (5 GHz) at the same angles of incidence as for the
infrared data. The optical modeling and data analysis were
performed using a commercial ellipsometry data analysis
TM
software package (WVASE32 , J.A. Woollam Company).
The ellipsometric data sets are analyzed using stratifiedlayer optical model calculations which consist of three layers,
ambient/polymethacrylate/ambient.20
The ellipsometric data obtained for the reference sample
was used to develop a model dielectric function for the polymethacrylate, which is composed of a sum of oscillators with

Note that experimental Ψ- and ∆-spectra were obtained for
Φa = 65◦ , 70◦ , and 75◦ and analyzed simultaneously, however, for clarity, the data for Φa = 70◦ is omitted here.
The experimental and best-model calculated data are in
very good agreement for the non-annealed reference sample.
Fabry-Pérot oscillations are observed in the range from 0.65
to 0.95 THz, indicating that the sample is transparent in this
spectral window. The IR range (9 to 120 THz), on the other
hand, is dominated by a number of distinct absorption features with Gaussian broadening profile. Further details on the
best-model parameters are provided in Tabs. 1 and 2 in Ref. 9.
Figures 4 and 5 show the experimental and best-model calculated cos(2Ψ) and sin(2Ψ) cos(∆) spectra obtained for the
samples annealed for 2 and 4 hours, respectively. Similar
to the ellipsometric data of the reference sample shown in
Figs. 1 and 2, the cos(2Ψ) and sin(2Ψ) cos(∆) spectra of the
annealed samples are dominated by Fabry-Pérot oscillations
in spectral range from 650 to 950 GHz. The experimental
data obtained for both annealed samples were analyzed using the model dielectric function established for the reference
sample without further varying the best-model oscillator parameters. In order to obtain a good agreement between experimental and model-calculated data, only the parameters for the
sample thickness were varied. The best-model thicknesses for
2 hours and 4 hours annealed samples were 1080 µ m ± 1 µ m
and 1086 µ m ± 1 µ m, respectively. These thickness values

are in an excellent agreement with the nominal thickness of
the samples, which is 1000 µ m. This suggests that annealing
for up to 4 hours at a temperature of 70 ◦ C does not lead to any
measurable changes in the THz dielectric function. A slight
reduction of the interference amplitude at higher THz frequencies can be noticed in Figs. 4 and 5. We have attributed this
reduction to a broad and shallow absorption located outside
of the accessible spectral range of the THz ellipsometer at approximately 1.2 THz. For further details regarding this broad
absorption, the interested reader is referred to Ref. 9.

ter thermal annealing by spectroscopic THz ellipsometry. A
model dielectric function consisting of Gaussian oscillators
was established using THz and infrared ellipsometric data obtained from an un-annealed sample. This model dielectric
function was also found to accurately render the experimental
cos(2Ψ) and sin(2Ψ) cos(∆) spectra from thermally annealed
samples in THz spectral range. In conclusion, the investigated
polymethacrylate was found to maintain a stable optical response in THz spectral range after thermal annealing at temperatures up to 70 ◦ C.
