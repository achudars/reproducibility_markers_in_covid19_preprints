Abstract
Although neural machine translation models reached high
translation quality, the autoregressive nature makes inference difficult to parallelize and leads to high translation latency. Inspired by recent refinement-based approaches, we
propose LaNMT, a latent-variable non-autoregressive model
with continuous latent variables and deterministic inference
procedure. In contrast to existing approaches, we use a deterministic inference algorithm to find the target sequence that
maximizes the lowerbound to the log-probability. During inference, the length of translation automatically adapts itself.
Our experiments show that the lowerbound can be greatly increased by running the inference algorithm, resulting in significantly improved translation quality. Our proposed model
closes the performance gap between non-autoregressive and
autoregressive approaches on ASPEC Ja-En dataset with 8.6x
faster decoding. On WMT’14 En-De dataset, our model narrows the gap with autoregressive baseline to 2.0 BLEU points
with 12.5x speedup. By decoding multiple initial latent variables in parallel and rescore using a teacher model, the proposed model further brings the gap down to 1.0 BLEU point
on WMT’14 En-De task with 6.8x speedup.

Introduction

The field of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has seen
significant improvements in recent years (Bahdanau, Cho,
and Bengio 2015; Wu et al. 2016; Gehring et al. 2017;
Vaswani et al. 2017). Despite impressive improvements in
translation accuracy, the autoregressive nature of NMT models have made it difficult to speed up decoding by utilizing parallel model architecture and hardware accelerators.
This has sparked interest in non-autoregressive NMT models, which predict every target tokens in parallel. In addition
to the obvious decoding efficiency, non-autoregressive text
generation is appealing as it does not suffer from exposure
bias and suboptimal inference.
Inspired by recent work in non-autoregressive NMT using discrete latent variables (Kaiser et al. 2018) and iterative refinement (Lee, Mansimov, and Cho 2018), we introduce a sequence of continuous latent variables to capture
the uncertainty in the target sentence. We motivate such a

latent variable model by conjecturing that it is easier to refine lower-dimensional continuous variables1 than to refine
high-dimensional discrete variables, as done in Lee, Mansimov, and Cho (2018). Unlike Kaiser et al. (2018), the posterior and the prior can be jointly trained to maximize the
evidence lowerbound of the log-likelihood log p(y|x).
In this work, we propose a deterministic iterative algorithm to refine the approximate posterior over the latent variables and obtain better target predictions. During inference,
we first obtain the initial posterior from a prior distribution
p(z|x) and the initial guess of the target sentence from the
conditional distribution p(y|x, z). We then alternate between
updating the approximate posterior and target tokens with
the help of an approximate posterior q(z|x, y). We avoid
stochasticity at inference time by introducing a delta posterior over the latent variables. We empirically find that this iterative algorithm significantly improves the lowerbound and
results in better BLEU scores. By refining the latent variables instead of tokens, the length of translation can dynamically adapt throughout this procedure, unlike previous approaches where the target length was fixed throughout the
refinement process. In other words, even if the initial length
prediction is incorrect, it can be corrected simultaneously
with the target tokens.
Our models2 outperform the autoregressive baseline on
ASPEC Ja-En dataset with 8.6x decoding speedup and bring
the performance gap down to 2.0 BLEU points on WMT’14
En-De with 12.5x decoding speedup. By decoding multiple
latent variables sampled from the prior and rescore using a
autoregressive teacher model, the proposed model is able to
further narrow the performance gap on WMT’14 En-De task
down to 1.0 BLEU point with 6.8x speedup. The contributions of this work can be summarize as follows:
1. We propose a continuous latent-variable nonautoregressive NMT model for faster inference. The
model learns identical number of latent vectors as the
input tokens. A length transformation mechanism is
designed to adapt the number of latent vectors to match
the target length.

of model by introducing a deterministic inference algorithm. We show the algorithm converges rapidly in practice and is capable of improving the translation quality by
around 2.0 BLEU points.

Non-Autoregressive NMT
Although autoregressive models achieve high translation
quality through recent advances in NMT, the main drawback
is that autoregressive modeling forbids the decoding algorithm to select tokens in multiple positions simultaneously.
This results in inefficient use of computational resource and
increased translation latency.
In contrast, non-autoregressive NMT models predict target tokens without depending on preceding tokens, depicted
by the following objective:
|y|

log p(y|x) =

X
i=i

log p(yi |x).

(2)

As the prediction of each target token yi now depends only
on the source sentence x and its location i in the sequence,
the translation process can be easily parallelized. We obtain
a target sequence by applying argmax to all token probabilities.
The main challenge of non-autoregressive NMT is on capturing dependencies among target tokens. As the probability
of each target token does not depend on the surrounding tokens, applying argmax at each position i may easily result in
an inconsistent sequence, that includes duplicated or missing
words. It is thus important for non-autoregressive models
to apply techniques to ensure the consistency of generated
words.

where y<i denotes the target tokens preceding yi . Here, the
probability of emitting each token p(yi |y<i , x) is parameterized with a neural network.
To obtain a translation from this model, one could predict target tokens sequentially by greedily taking argmax
of the token prediction probabilities. The decoding progress
ends when a “</s>” token, which indicates the end of a
sequence, is selected. In practice, however, this greedy approach yields suboptimal sentences, and beam search is often used to decode better translations by maintaining multiple hypotheses. However, decoding with a large beam size
significantly decreases translation speed.

Latent-Variable Non-Autoregressive NMT

In this work, we propose LaNMT, a latent-variable nonautoregressive NMT model by introducing a sequence of
continuous latent variables to model the uncertainty about
the target sentence. These latent variables z are constrained
to have the same length as the source sequence, that is,
|z| = |x|. Instead of directly maximizing the objective function in Eq. (2), we maximize a lowerbound
to the marginal

L(ω, φ, θ) = Ez∼qφ log pθ (y|x, z)


− KL qφ (z|x, y)||pω (z|x) ,

(3)

where pω (z|x) is the prior, qφ (z|x, y) is an approximate posterior and pθ (y|x, z) is the decoder. The objective function
in Eq. (3) is referred to as the evidence lowerbound (ELBO).
As shown in the equation, the lowerbound is parameterized
by three sets of parameters: ω, φ and θ.
Both the prior pω and the approximate posterior qφ are
modeled as spherical Gaussian distributions. The model
can be trained end-to-end with the reparameterization trick
(Kingma and Welling 2014).

A Modified Objective Function with Length
Prediction
During training, we want the model to maximize the lowerbound in Eq. (3). However, to generate a translation, the target length ly has to be predicted first. We let the latent variables model the target length by parameterizing the decoder

Model Architecture
As evident from in Eq. (5), there are four parameterized components in our model: the prior pω (z|x), approximate posterior qφ (z|x, y), decoder pθ (y|x, z, ly ) and length
predictor pθ (ly |z). The architecture of the proposed nonautoregressive model is depicted in Fig. 1, which reuses
modules in Transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017) to compute
the aforementioned distributions.
Main Components To compute the prior pω (z|x), we
use a multi-layer self-attention encoder which has the same
structure as the Transformer encoder. In each layer, a feedforward computation is applied after the self-attention. To
obtain the probability, we apply a linear transformation to
reduce the dimensionality and compute the mean and variance vectors.
For the approximate posterior qφ (z|x, y), as it is a function of the source x and the target y, we first encode y with
a self-attention encoder. Then, the resulting vectors are fed
into an attention-based decoder initialized by x embeddings.
Its architecture is similar to the Transformer decoder except
that no causal mask is used. Similar to the prior, we apply a
linear layer to obtain the mean and variance vectors.
To backpropagate the loss signal of the decoder to qφ , we
apply the reparameterization trick to sample z from qφ with
g(, q) = µq + σq ∗ . Here,  ∼ N (0, 1) is Gaussian noise.
The decoder computes the probability pθ (y|x, z, ly ) of
outputting target tokens y given the latent variables sampled
from qφ (z|x, y). The computational graph of the decoder is
also similar to the Transformer decoder without using causal
mask. To combine the information from the source tokens,
we reuse the encoder vector representation created when

distribution that covers the length difference in the range
[−50, 50]. The prediction is produced by applying softmax
after a linear transformation.
As the latent variable z ∼ qφ (z|x, y) has the length |x|,
we need to transform the latent variables into ly vectors for
the decoder to predict target tokens. We use a monotonic
location-based attention for this purpose, which is illustrated
in Fig. 2. Let the resulting vectors of length transformation
be z̄1 , ..., z̄ly . we produce each vector with

where each transformed vector is a weighted sum of the latent variables. The weight is computed with a softmax over
distance-based logits. We give higher weights to the latent
variables close to the location |x|
ly j. The scale σ is the only
trainable parameter in this monotonic attention mechanism.

Training
If we train a model with the objective function in Eq. (5),
the KL divergence often drops to zero from the beginning.
This yields a degenerate model that does not use the latent
variables at all. This is a well-known issue in variational
inference called posterior collapse (Bowman et al. 2015;
Dieng et al. 2018; Razavi et al. 2019). We use two techniques to address this issue. Similarly to Kingma, Salimans,
and Welling (2016), we give a budget to the KL term as
|x|
X
k=1

Length Prediction and Transformation Given a latent
variable z sampled from the approximate posterior qφ , we
train a length prediction model pθ (ly |z). We train the model
to predict the length difference between |y| and |x|. In
our implementation, pθ (ly |z) is modeled as a categorical

z1 z2 z3 z4 z5 z6 z7



max(b, KL qφ (zk |x, y)||pω (zk |x) ),

(9)

where b is the budget of KL divergence for each latent variable. Once the KL value drops below b, it will not be minimized anymore, thereby letting the optimizer focus on the
reconstruction term in the original objective function. As b is
a critical hyperparameter, it is time-consuming to search for

a good budget value. Here, we use the following annealing
schedule to gradually lower the budget:
(
1,
if s < M/2
b = (M −s)
(10)
,
otherwise
M/2
s is the current step in training, and M is the maximum step.
In the first half of the training, the budget b remains 1. In the
second half of the training, we anneal b until it reaches 0.
Similarly to previous work on non-autoregressive NMT,
we apply sequence-level knowledge distillation (Kim and
Rush 2016) where we use the output from an autoregressive
model as target for our non-autoregressive model.

Inference with a Delta Posterior

Once the training has converged, we use an inference algorithm to find a translation y that maximizes the lowerbound
in Eq. (3):


argmax Ez∼qφ log pθ (y|x, z)
y


− KL qφ (z|x, y)||pω (z|x)

It is intractable to solve this problem exactly due to the
intractability of computing the first expectation. We avoid
this issue in the training time by reparametrization-based
Monte Carlo approximation. However, it is desirable to
avoid stochasticity at inference time where our goal is to
present a single most likely target sentence given a source
sentence.
We tackle this problem by introducing a proxy distribution r(z) defined as

1, if z = µ
r(z) =
0, otherwise
This is a Dirac measure, and we call it a delta posterior in
our work. We set this delta posterior to minimize the KL
divergence against the approximate posterior qφ , which is
equivalent to
∇µ log qφ (µ|x, y) = 0 ⇔ µ = Eqφ [z] .

(11)

We then use this proxy instead of the original approximate
posterior to obtain a deterministic lowerbound:
L̂(ω, θ, µ) = log pθ (y|x, z = µ) − log pω (µ|x).

As the second term is constant with respect to y, maximizing
this lowerbound with respect to y reduces to
argmax log pθ (y|x, z = µ),

(12)

y

which can be approximately solved by beam search when
pθ is an autoregressive sequence model. If pθ factorizes over
the sequence y, as in our non-autoregressive model, we can
solve it exactly by
ŷi = argmax log pθ (yi |x, z = µ).
yi

With every estimation of y, the approximate posterior q
changes. We thus alternate between fitting the delta posterior in Eq. (11) and finding the most likely sequence y in
Eq. (12).

We initialize the delta posterior r using the prior distribution:
µ = Epω (z|x) [z] .
With this initialization, the proposed inference algorithm is
fully deterministic. The complete inference algorithm for
obtaining the final translation is shown in Algorithm 1.

Related Work

This work is inspired by a recent line of work in nonautoregressive NMT. Gu et al. (2018) first proposed a nonautoregressive framework by modeling word alignment as
a latent variable, which has since then been improved by
Wang et al. (2019). Lee, Mansimov, and Cho (2018) proposed a deterministic iterative refinement algorithm where
a decoder is trained to refine the hypotheses. Our approach is most related to Kaiser et al.; Roy et al. (2018;
2018). In both works, a discrete autoencoder is first trained
on the target sentence, then an autoregressive prior is trained
to predict the discrete latent variables given the source sentence. Our work is different from them in three ways: (1)
we use continuous latent variables and train the approximate
posterior q(z|x, y) and the prior p(z|x) jointly; (2) we use
a non-autoregressive prior; and (3) the refinement is performed in the latent space, as opposed to discrete output
space (as done in most previous works using refinement for
non-autoregressive machine translation).
Concurrently to our work, Ghazvininejad et al. (2019)
proposed to translate with a masked-prediction language
model by iterative replacing tokens with low confidence. Gu,
Liu, and Cho; Stern et al.; Welleck et al. (2019; 2019; 2019)
proposed insertion-based NMT models that insert words to
the translations with a specific strategy. Unlike these works,
our approach performs refinements in the low-dimensional
latent space, rather than in the high-dimensional discrete
space.
Similarly to our latent-variable model, Zhang, Xiong, and
Su (2016) proposed a variational NMT, and Shah and Barber
(2018) and Eikema and Aziz (2018) models the joint distribution of source and target. Both of them use autoregressive
models. Shah and Barber (2018) designed an EM-like algorithm similar to Markov sampling (Arulkumaran, Creswell,
and Bharath 2017). In contrast, we propose a deterministic
algorithm to remove any non-determinism during inference.

Experimental Settings

Data and preprocessing We evaluate our model on two
machine translation datasets: ASPEC Ja-En (Nakazawa et al.
2016) and WMT’14 En-De (Bojar et al. 2014). The ASPEC
dataset contains 3M sentence pairs, and the WMT’14 dataset
contains 4.5M senence pairs.
To preprocess the ASPEC dataset, we use Moses
toolkit (Koehn et al. 2007) to tokenize the English sentences,
and Kytea (Neubig, Nakata, and Mori 2011) for Japanese
sentences. We further apply byte-pair encoding (Sennrich,
Haddow, and Birch 2016) to segment the training sentences
into subwords. The resulting vocabulary has 40K unique
tokens on each side of the language pair. To preprocess
the WMT’14 dataset, we apply sentencepiece (Kudo and
Richardson 2018) to both languages to segment the corpus
into subwords and build a joint vocabulary. The final vocabulary size is 32K for each language.
Learning To train the proposed non-autoregressive models, we adapt the same learning rate annealing schedule as
the Base Transformer. Model hyperparameters are selected
based on the validation ELBO value.
The only new hyperparameter in the proposed model is
the dimension of each latent variable. If each latent is a highdimension vector, although it has a higher capacity, the KL
divergence in Eq. (3) becomes difficult to minimize. In practice, we found that latent dimensionality values between 4
and 32 result in similar performance. However, when the dimensionality is significantly higher or lower, we observed a
performance drop. In all experiments, we set the latent dimensionionality to 8. We use a hidden size of 512 and feedforward filter size of 2048 for all models in our experiments.
We use 6 transformer layers for the prior and the decoder,
and 3 transformer layers for the approximate posterior.
Evaluation We evaluate the tokenized BLEU for ASPEC
Ja-En datset. For WMT’14 En-De datset, we use SacreBLEU (Post 2018) to evaluate the translation results. We follow Lee, Mansimov, and Cho (2018) to remove repetitions
from the translation results before evaluating BLEU scores.
Latent Search To further exploit the parallelizability of
GPUs, we sample multiple initial latent variables from the
prior pω (z|x). Then we perform the deterministic inference

on each latent variable to obtain a list of candidate translations. However, we can not afford to evaluate each candidate using Eq. (5), which requires importance sampling
on qφ . Instead, we use the autoregressive baseline model
to score all the candidates, and pick the candidate with the
highest log probability. Following Parmar et al. (2018), we
reduce the temperature by a factor of 0.5 when sampling latent variables, resulting in better translation quality. To avoid
stochasticity, we fix the random seed during sampling.

Result and Analysis

Quantitative Analysis
Our quantitative results on both datasets are presented in Table 1. The baseline model in our experiments is a base Transformer. Our implementation of the autoregressive baseline is
1.0 BLEU points lower than the original paper (Vaswani et
al. 2017) on WMT’14 En-De datase. We measure the latency
of decoding each sentence on a single NVIDIA V100 GPU
for all models, which is averaged over all test samples.
As shown in Table 1, without knowledge distillation, we
observe a significant gap in translation quality compared to
the autoregressive baseline. This observation is in line with
previous works on non-autoregressive NMT (Gu et al. 2018;
Lee, Mansimov, and Cho 2018; Wang et al. 2019). The gap
is significantly reduced by using knowledge distillation, as
translation targets provided by the autoregressive model are
easier to predict.
With the proposed deterministic inference algorithm, we
significantly improve translation quality by 2.3 BLEU points
on ASPEC Ja-En dataset and 1.9 BLEU points on WMT’14
En-De dataset. Here, we only run the algorithm for one step.
We observe gain on ELBO by running more iterative steps,
which is however not reflected by the BLEU scores. As a
result, we outperform the autoregressive baseline on ASPEC dataset with a speedup of 8.6x. For WMT’14 dataset,
although the proposed model reaches a speedup of 12.5x,
the gap with the autoregressive baseline still remains, at 2.0
BLEU points. We conjecture that WMT’14 En-De is more
difficult for our non-autoregressive model as it contains a
high degree of noise (Ott et al. 2018).
By searching over multiple initial latent variables and
rescoring with the teacher Transformer model, we observe
an increase in performance by 0.7 ∼ 1.0 BLEU score at
the cost of lower translation speed. In our experiments, we

sample 50 candidate latent variables and decode them in parallel. The slowdown is mainly caused by rescoring. With the
help of rescoring, our final model further narrows the performance gap with the autoregressive baseline to 1.0 BLEU
with 6.8x speedup on WMT’14 En-De task.

Non-autoregressive NMT Models
In Table 2, we list the results on WMT’14 En-De by existing non-autoregressive NMT approaches. All the models use
Transformer as their autoregressive baselines. In comparison, our proposed model suffers a drop of 1.0 BLEU points
over the baseline, which is a relatively small gap among the
existing models. Thanks to the rapid convergence of the proposed deterministic inference algorithm, our model achieves
a higher speed-up compared to other refinement-based models and provides a better speed-accuracy tradeoff.
Concurrently to our work, the mask-prediction language
model (Ghazvininejad et al. 2019) was found to reduce the
performance gap down to 0.9 BLEU on WMT’14 En-De
while still maintaining a reasonable speed-up. The main difference is that we update a delta posterior over latent variables instead of target tokens. Both Ghazvininejad et al.
(2019) and Wang et al. (2019) with autoregressive rescoring decode multiple candidates in batch and choose one final
translation from them. FlowSeq (Ma et al. 2019) is an recent
interesting work on flow-based prior. With noisy parallel decoding, FlowSeq can be fairly compared to the latent search
setting of our model. In Table 2, we can see that our model
is equivalently or more effective without a flow-based prior.
It is intriguing to see a combination with the flow approach.

Analysis of Deterministic Inference
Convergences of ELBO and BLEU In this section, we
empirically show that the proposed deterministic iterative
inference improves the ELBO in Eq. (3). As the ELBO is
a function of x and y, we measure the ELBO value with the
new target prediction after each iteration during inference.
For each instance, we sample 20 latent variables to compute
the expectation in Eq. (3). The ELBO value is further averaged over data samples.
In Fig. 3, we show the ELBO value and the resulting BLEU scores for both datasets. In the initial step,
the delta posterior is initialized with the prior distribution
pω (z|x). We see that the ELBO value increases rapidly with
each refinement step, which means a higher lowerbound to
log p(y|x). The improvement is highly correlated with increasing BLEU scores. For around 80% of the data samples,
the algorithm converges within three steps. We observe the
BLEU scores peaked after only one refinement step.

Trade-off between Quality and Speed In Fig. 4, we show
the trade-off between translation quality and the speed gain
on WMT’14 En-De task when considering multiple candidates latent variables in parallel. We vary the number of candidates from 10 to 100, and report BLEU scores and relative speed gains in the scatter plot. The results are divided
into two groups. The first group of experiments search over
multiple latent variables and rescore with the teacher Transformer. The second group applies the proposed deterministic
inference before rescoring.
We observe that the proposed deterministic inference consistently improves translation quality in all settings. The
BLEU score peaks at 25.2. As GPUs excel at processing
massive computations in parallel, we can see that the translation speed only degrades by a small magnitude.

Qualitative Analysis
We present some translation examples to demonstrate the
effect of the proposed iterative inference in Table 3. In Example 1, the length of the target sequence does not change
but only the tokens are replaced over the refinement iterations. The second and third examples show that the algorithm removes or inserts words during the iterative inference
by adaptively changing the target length. Such a significant
modification to the predicted sequence mostly happens when
translating long sentences.
For some test examples, however, we still find duplicated
words in the final translation after applying the proposed
deterministic inference. For them, we notice that the quality of the initial guess of translation is considerably worse
than average, which typically contains multiple duplicated
words. Thus, a high-quality initial guess is crucial for obtaining good translations.

Conclusion

Our work presents the first approach to use continuous latent variables for non-autoregressive Neural Machine Translation. The key idea is to introduce a sequence of latent variables to capture the uncertainly in the target sentence. The
number of latent vectors is always identical to the number
of input tokens. A length transformation mechanism is then
applied to adapt the latent vectors to match the target length.
We train the proposed model by maximizing the lowerbound
of the log-probability log p(y|x).
We then introduce a deterministic inference algorithm that
uses a delta posterior over the latent variables. The algorithm alternates between updating the delta posterior and the
target tokens. Our experiments show that the algorithm is
able to improve the evidence lowerbound of predicted target sequence rapidly. In our experiments, the BLEU scores
converge in one refinement step.
Our non-autoregressive NMT model closes the performance gap with autoregressive baseline on ASPEC Ja-En
task with a 8.6x speedup. By decoding multiple latent variables sampled from the prior, our model brings down the gap
on En-De task down to 1.0 BLEU with a speedup of 6.8x.
