Abstract
We have incorporated the van der Waals interactions in the framework of a statistical
thermodynamical model for the case of a hadron resonance gas system, which is expected
to

form

in

the

ultra-relativistic

nucleus-nucleus

collisions.

This

approach

is

thermodynamically consistent. We have obtained various particle ratios and studied their
dependence on temperature and baryon chemical potential (μ ) of the system. These
results on particle ratios are compared with the corresponding results of the point-like
hadron model and also with the case where baryonic hard-core repulsion is though taken
into account, but in a thermodynamically inconsistent manner. It is found that the particle
ratios get significantly modified in the case of van der Waals interactions for a baryon rich
system. In the van der Waals type equation of state (EoS) both the attractive and repulsive
parts of interactions have been taken into account. The two parameters through which
these, attractive and repulsive interactions, are taken into account in the present
calculations have been fixed as

= 329 MeVfm and

= 8.56 fm , respectively. The

values of these parameters have been obtained from the previous studies which are
required to reproduce the ground state properties of nuclear matter.

1. Introduction
The study of the production of various hadronic species allows us to understand the final
stage property of the hot and dense hadronic matter produced in ultra-relativistic nucleusnucleus collisions. Such a matter may attain a reasonably high degree of thermal and chemical
equilibrium. The relative hadronic yields are an important tool for understanding this aspect.
After the initial collision, the hot and highly dense secondary partonic matter produced
(consisting of quarks and gluons) is in a pre-equilibrium state. However, due to multiple
collisions among these secondary partons a reasonably high degree of thermal and chemical
equilibrium is achieved leading to the possible formation of quark gluon plasma (QGP) state.
This is then followed by a QGP–hadron gas mixed state and then finally the system goes into a
hot and dense gaseous state of interacting hadrons. As the collisions among these hadrons
continue hence a high degree of thermo-chemical equilibrium in the hadronic gas phase may
be attained. As the system expands, cools and gets diluted further, the mean free path of the
various hadronic species becomes comparable with the overall system size and consequently
the hadrons no longer interact strongly with each other and a thermo-chemical “freeze-out”
occurs [1]. The properties of such a hadronic matter has often been successfully described in
the framework of statistical thermodynamical models assuming the existence of a hot and
dense hadronic resonance gas.
However, the ideal hadron resonance gas model of point-like non-interacting particles does
not reproduce the ground state properties of the nuclear matter. Besides no reasonable quark
hadron phase transition in the theoretical models is obtained with sufficiently large number
of degrees of freedom [2-5] in the hadronic phase. This happens because at sufficiently high
temperature (T) a large number of point-like hadronic resonances can be thermally excited in
any given volume (without repulsive interaction). Consequently, in a thermodynamical model
assuming a first order quark-hadron phase transition with a large number of hadronic
degrees of freedom, the hadronic pressure becomes larger than quark gluon plasma (QGP)
pressure and the system reverts to the hadron resonance gas (HRG) phase at sufficiently high
temperatures. This also contradicts the lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) predictions
where the phase transition occurs at the critical temperature around 160-180 MeV for
vanishing net baryon number and the system remains in the QGP phase at further higher
temperatures. In the thermal model approach this problem can be solved by considering the
repulsive interaction between baryons (or antibaryons). This also leads to an excluded
volume type effect. However, in a more realistic approach both, i.e. the attractive and

2

repulsive interactions should be taken into account. The repulsive interaction is found to be
proportional to number density (n) which vanishes for

≅ 0 [6-8].

In the present work, we have used the grand canonical ensemble (GCE) partition function
approach to explain the properties of baryonic matter. This is because of the fact that the
canonical ensemble pressure doesn't provide a comprehensive thermodynamical picture of
the system as the specification of the variables like volume (V), temperature (T) and the
number of particles (N) are not the accepted variables for the pressure function and the
number of hadrons of a given type is usually not conserved in the real systems. The GCE
formulation can provide a very suitable framework for incorporating the attractive and
repulsive interactions into the multi-component hadron gas. The GCE formulation can be
effectively used to calculate abundances of various particles and their ratios in the system.
The repulsive part is incorporated through the excluded volume type effect in the hadron
resonance gas (HRG) model and is generally known as EV-HRG model of heavy ion collisions
[9-12] and the attractive part of the interaction is incorporated by multiplying the partition
function with an exponential factor containing an average attractive potential. There are
however other ways also of modelling the attractive and repulsive interactions such as
Walecka model and its generalizations [13-17]. In van der Waals model the strength of
repulsion is proportional to the total particle density and is finite at zero baryon chemical
potential (μ = 0 ). On the other hand in Walecka model, the strength of repulsion is
proportional to the net baryon density and hence vanishes at (

= 0). This is therefore a

significant advantage of van der Waals approach over Walecka approach. We have arranged
this article as follows. In section 2, we have attempted to incorporate the van der Waals type
interactions within the framework of statistical thermodynamical model for a hadronic
resonance gas system. We have derived the expressions for effective baryon chemical
potential (μ∗ ) and the modified particle number density (n) using grand canonical partition
function formulation with repulsive as well as attractive interactions. In section 3, we have
presented the results of our calculations and discussions and finally in section 4, we briefly
summarise our results and make conclusions.

2. Model
The grand canonical ensemble (GCE) formulation of equation of state (EoS) of hadronic
matter is presented in this section. The van der Waals equation of state (EoS) governing the
behaviour of baryonic matter can be derived from the grand partition function. For an ideal
point-like non-interacting gas of hadrons, the grand canonical partition function is given by:

3

!(", , $) = ∑∞

'/"

!(", ', $)

(1)

For simplicity we have used μ = μ in the remaining part of this section. By introducing a
hard-core repulsive and attractive interactions, in the ideal grand partition function the
equation (1) can be rewritten as [7]:

! )*+ (", , $) = ∑∞
/01 &

,.

× !(", ', $ − ')& 45/6

(2a)

Where, ' is the excluded volume for the baryons due to their hard-core repulsive interaction

and $ − ' is the available volume in the system [7]. The attractive interaction is
incorporated by introducing the factor & 45/6 in the grand partition function, where 7
represents the average attractive interaction energy assuming uniform density, n=N/V. The
average attractive interaction energy can be written as:
8

7 = ∑),= $:++ (;<) − ;<= )

(2b)

9

Here $:++ (;<) − ;<= ) is the average interaction energy of two particles which depends on their
relative coordinates. At any given instant of time it is generally sufficient to consider only one
pair of particles [7]. Therefore the total interaction energy can be obtained by summing over
all the particle pairs. The equation (2b) then takes the form (for large n):

7≈

Here, ;< is the relative coordinate. We can thus write:

In order to identify the pressure function we take the Laplace transform of equation (4) and
identify its extreme right hand singularity. For more detail on this approach one may refer to
Rischke et al [3]. The Laplace transformation may be defined as:

The summation over the index i in the denominator also includes j.
The equation (20) gives the number density ( = ) of the jth type baryonic specie for the
interacting baryonic matter using van der Waals interactions, where "b" is the excluded

8‡

D;= ), ;= is the hard-core radius of the j„… hadronic species. On the

other hand the effect of the attractive interaction appears through the “effective” baryon
chemical potential (

∗

) in equation 16. It is to be stressed here that this approach provides

results which are thermodynamically consistent. In our present work we have extended this
model to include baryon octet, omega and Kaons, which were not discussed in most of the
previous works except for the case of nucleons [18-23]. In the following we discuss the results.
Here it is also important to define the chemical potentials of various hadrons. We follow the
following standard procedure.
For each light valence (u, d) quark in a given hadronic specie we assign it a chemical potential

µq, with µq = µB/3 where µB is the baryon chemical potential. Hence for a hadron with Nq
number of light valence quarks the corresponding chemical potential will be Nqµq. Similarly
we assign it an additional chemical potential Nsµs, where µs is the strange quark chemical
potential and Ns is the number of valence strange quarks in the given hadronic specie.
Consequently the chemical potential of a given jth hadronic specie will be

=

=

= 'ˆ

ˆ

=

+ '‰

‰.

If a hadron contains Nq number of valence light antiquarks and Ns number of valence
antistrange quarks its chemical potential be written as µŠ̅ = - Nqµq - Nsµs . For example this
gives for Lambda (having 2 light quarks and 1 strange quark) µΛ = 2µq + µs. Similarly for
Kaon, which contains a light quark and a strange antiquark, we get µk = µq - µs . This
procedure can be similarly applied to define the chemical potentials of all other hadrons
(mesons, baryons and antibaryons). The overall strangeness conservation constraint then
requires that the total strange content of the system must be equal to the total antistrange
content of the system. This is used to fix the value of the strange chemical potential

‰

for any

given value of µB (or µ) and T.
It may further be noted that the application of equation (19) to the antibaryonic sector
requires that the “effective” chemical potential for antibaryons (

potentials. This opposite behaviour seems to emerge from the different pattern of variation of
the effective strange chemical potential with increasing temperature for these cases,

So far in the above we have discussed the relative abundances of equal--mass anti-particle to
particle ratios only. However, it also useful to calculate the relative abundances of strange to
non-strange (unequal-mass) hadronic yields as these quantities are often measured in several

dependence of the individual nucleon and anti-nucleon densities at

=300 MeV.
MeV We notice

that at higher temperatures nucleon density gets significantly modified by using the VDW type
EoS, as compared to point-like
like and thermodynamically inconsistent model cases. Similarly,
the
he variation of the individual nucleon and anti-nucleon
anti
densities with

at fixed value of T =

150 MeV is shown in figure 21. It is worthwhile to notee that the effect of increasing attractive
interaction strength, i.e. increasing the value of “a”,
“a” is to increase the nucleon density while
the effect of increasing the repulsive hard-core
hard core radius is to decrease the density. This happens
17

because the attractive
ve potential tends to cluster the nucleons closure to each other while the
repulsive potential has exactly the opposite effect. This therefore should be expected from any
reasonable thermal model incorporating the attractive and repulsive interactions.

4. Summary and Conclusion:
We have provided a grand canonical ensemble formulation for a multi--component hadronic
resonance gas system.. We have considered the attractive as well as repulsive interaction
among the constituent baryons (antibaryons).
(
. Using our formulation we have calculated
several relative hadronic yields as well as nucleon (antinucleon) densities in the system.

with temperature (T) and baryon chemical potential (

find that by the inclusion of the attractive and repulsive parts of the interaction in framework
of van der Walls equation of state, the particle ratios get modified particularly at higher values
of T for a baryon rich system, which maintains large value of

in the nucleus-nucleus collisions in the present CBM and at the lowest RHIC energies. The
incorporation of the attractive and repulsive interactions in our calculations is found to affect
the particle densities in a way which seems justified and should be expected from any
reasonable thermal model.
