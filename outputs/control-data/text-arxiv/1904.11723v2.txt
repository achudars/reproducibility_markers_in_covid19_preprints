Abstract. Web pornography represents a large fraction of the Internet
traffic, with thousands of websites and millions of users. Studying web
pornography consumption allows understanding human behaviors and it
is crucial for medical and psychological research. However, given the lack
of public data, these works typically build on surveys, limited by different factors, e.g., unreliable answers that volunteers may (involuntarily)
provide.
In this work, we collect anonymized accesses to pornography websites using HTTP-level passive traces. Our dataset includes about 15 000 broadband subscribers over a period of 3 years. We use it to provide quantitative information about the interactions of users with pornographic websites, focusing on time and frequency of use, habits, and trends. We distribute our anonymized dataset to the community to ease reproducibility
and allow further studies.
Keywords: Passive Measurements; Web Pornography; Adult Content;
User Behaviour; Network Monitoring.

Introduction

Pornography and technology have enjoyed a close relationship in the last decades,
with technology hugely increasing the capabilities of the porn industry. From the
limited market reachable through public theatres, the introduction of the videocassette recorder in the 1970s abruptly changed the way of accessing pornography, allowing to access pornography in the privacy and comfort of each individual home. Then, the birth of cable networks and specialty channels in the
1990s, allowed a further step towards accessibility and privacy, giving the possibility to retrieve content directly from home. Finally, the Internet revolutionized
again the market, guaranteeing direct desktop delivery to every individual with
a connection, interactivity through forums and webcams, free content and, at
the same time, anonymity. In 2017, the most used pornographic platform in the
world (Pornhub, according to Alexa ranking)1 , claims 80 million daily accesses

to its website.2 The importance of Internet pornography as a prevalent component of popular culture and the need of its study has been recognized for a long
time [6].
In this work we do not attempt to classify Internet pornography. Rather, we
refer to the term web pornography (WP) to any online material that, directly or
indirectly, seeks to bring about sexual stimulation [4]. Therefore, the term pornographic website is here used to describe services that provide actual pornographic
videos, sell sex related merchandise, help in arranging sexual encounters, etc. We
refer only to adult pornography websites and we do not advocate the inclusion
of child pornography websites in our research, thus this paper has no application
whatsoever to child pornography. The word pornography, in the context of this
article, refers exclusively to legal content in the territories of EU and USA.
Through the years, WP has been the subject of many studies, that aimed
at describing how people make use of it, or pinpointing eventual pathological
situation correlated to an excessive use. However, such works typically come
from the medical and psychology communities, and are based on surveys that
cover a very small number of volunteers. Moreover, previous studies [12,10] report
that people tend to lie, either consciously or unconsciously, when answering to
private-life concerning surveys, especially about sexuality; there are people who
declare more accesses than real (e.g., to show to be uninhibited) and others who
understate the actual consumption, fearing social blame. Both these behaviours,
called social desirability biases, and egosyntonic/egodystonic feelings (i.e., being
or not in accordance with their self-image) make surveys less reliable with respect
to other sources of information.
In contrast to previous works, in this study we investigate WP by means
of passive network measurements, collected from about 15 000 broadband subscribers over a period of 3 years. MindGeek, a company operating many popular
pornographic websites, switched to encryption only in April 2017, being the first
big player of WP industry to adopt HTTPS.3 As such, the vast majority of
WP portals used plain-text HTTP up to March 2017, allowing us to leverage
HTTP-level measurements, and obtain detailed results of WP consumption. Using recent advances in data science, we extract only user actions to WP portals
from a deluge of HTTP data.
The main contributions of this paper are:
– We provide a thorough characterization of WP consumption leveraging measurements from 15 000 broadband subscribers over a period of 3 years.
– We show how users moved to mobile devices through the years, even if the
time spent onWP remains constant.
– We show that typical WP sessions last less than 15 minutes, with users
rarely accessing more than one website. Less than 10% of users consume
WP more than 15 days in a month, and repeated use within a single day is
very sporadic.

– We release our dataset to the community in anonymized form for further
investigation [1]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only public datasets
that includes WP accesses from regular Internet users.
The employed metrics are taken from the surveys reported in medical literature and from WP portal reports that we use throughout the paper. We restrict
our analysis only to those that we were able to verify given our data. Our results
enhance the visibility and understanding of those topics, and give a less mediated overview of users behaviors, mostly confirming what emerges from medical
surveys.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 summarizes
related work. Section 3 describes data collection, processing and privacy issues,
while Section 4 presents the results. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper.

Related Work

Most previous works that investigate the interaction between users and WP
leverage the information contained in surveys proposed to groups of volunteers.
Vaillancourt-Morel et al. [18] examine the potential presence of different profiles
of pornography users and their relation with sexual satisfaction and sexual dysfunction. The investigation is conducted over a poll that involved 830 adults,
and they group users’ behavior in three clusters. Daspe et al. [5] investigate the
relationship between frequency of WP consumption and the personal perception
of this behavior, pointing out that often there are strong discrepancies. Another
analysis of the phenomenon is provided by Grubbs et al. [9], where the analysis
is conducted over two participants sets, divided in students and adults, showing that moral scruples can infect the self-impression over their consumption.
Wetterneck et al. [14] propose a critical analysis of WP, showing the various
limitations of the state of the art of studies that assessed online pornography
usage, concerning its definition, consumption, and the variability of its measurements.
Fewer works used network measurements to study WP. Tyson et al. [17]
extract trends and characteristics in a major adult video portal (YouPorn) by
analyzing almost 200k videos, together with meta-data such as page content,
ratings and tags. In a similar direction, Mazieres et al. [11] produce and analyze
a semantic network of WP categories, extracted from the portal xHamster, in
order to find which are the most dominants and if they are actually meaningful.
Ortiz et al. [13] study a Chilean websites containing human images and classify
them in normal, porno and nude, with the objective of automatically discovering
WP websites. Finally, Coletto et al. [3] study users’ activity in social networks
related to WP, in order to extract information about the seclusion of those
communities with respect to the rest of the population and their characteristics
in terms of age and habits and gender. To the best of our knowledge, we are the
first to use passive measurements to study the behavior of users accessing web
pornography.

Measurements
Data Collection

In this work, we rely on network measurements coming from passive monitoring
of a population of broadband subscribers over a period of 3 years (from March
2014 to March 2017). We have instrumented a Point-of-Presence (PoP) of a
European ISP, where ≈ 10 000 ADSL and ≈ 5 000 FTTH customers are aggregated. ADSL downlink capacity is 4–20 Mbit/s, with uplink limited to 1 Mb/s.
FTTH users enjoy 100 Mb/s downlink, and 10 Mbit/s uplink. Each subscription
refers to an installation, where users’ devices (PCs, smartphones, etc.) connect
via WiFi or Ethernet through a home gateway. Important to our analysis, the
ISP provides each customer a fixed IP address, allowing us to track her over
time. Nevertheless, a small fraction of customers abandoned the ISP during the
observation period, and few new ones joined. All ADSL customers are residential
customers (i.e., households), while a small number of business customers exist
among the FTTH customers.
To gather measurements we use Tstat [15], a passive meter that collects
rich per-flow summaries, with hundreds of statistics regarding TCP/UDP connections issued by clients. Beside, Tstat includes a DPI module that creates log
files containing details about observed HTTP transactions. For each transaction,
it records the URL, a client identifier as well as other HTTP headers of requests
and responses. Our measurements are based on the inspection of HTTP headers, and, as such, neglect all encrypted traffic. However, no big WP portal used
encryption at the time our dataset was collected. Generated log files are copied
to our back-end servers with a daily frequency. Data is stored on a medium-sized
Hadoop cluster to allow scalable processing. All processing is done using Apache
Spark and Python. The stored data covers 3 years of measurements, totaling
20.5 TB of compressed and anonymized flow logs (around 138 billion records).
3.2

Definition of user and its limitations

Our PoP is located at the Broadband Remote Access Server (BRAS) level. Each
subscription is identified by a unique and fixed IP address. However, subscriptions typically refer to households where potentially more than one person surf
the Internet sharing the same public IP address. As such, relying on the client
IP to identify a user would not be precise enough to study habits and behavior.
Thus, in our work we define a user as the concatenation of the client IP address
and the user-agent as extracted from the corresponding HTTP header. Note
that with this definition a single person may appear multiple times with different identifiers if she uses multiple devices or her device incurs software updates
that modify the user agent string. Analyses are thus performed on a per-browser
fashion – i.e., each user-agent string observed in a household. Privacy requirements limit any finer granularity.
The evaluated dataset includes only a regional sample of households in a single country. Users in other regions may have diverse browsing habits. Equally,

mobile devices have been monitored only while connected to home WiFi networks. As such, our quantification of browsing on mobile terminals is actually a
lower-bound, since visits while connected on mobile networks are not captured.
3.3

Data filtering and session definition

Starting from a HTTP-level dataset, we need to filter only entries referring to
WP websites. Studying innovative methodologies to automatically isolate traffic towards particular services is out of the scope of this work. We employ a
blacklist based approach to perform classification. We build on public available
lists, achieving robustness by combining three different sources.4 These three
lists provide a set of domain names that offer different WP content (ranging
from video streaming to thematic forums). To avoid false positives, we consider
only those domain names contained in at least two over three lists. We come up
with 310 252 unique entries, arranged over 460 top-level domains.
After filtering entries referring to WP websites, we perform a further step to
identify sessions of continuous activity. To this end, we group data by user, and
process HTTP transactions by start time. We then identify session as follows:
when a user accesses a pornographic website we open a new session and account
to this all subsequent entries to WP websites. We terminate a session if we do not
observe any entry to WP for a period of 30 minutes. While defining a browsing
session is complicated [8], we simply consider a time larger than 30 minutes as
an indication of the session end as it is often seen in previous works (e.g., [2]),
and in applications like Google Analytics.5
3.4

User actions extraction

Subsequently, we further filter the dataset to isolate only those HTTP requests
containing an explicit user action by the user. This step aims at isolating users’
behavior discarding all HTTP traffic related to inner objects of webpages such
as images, style-sheets, and scripts To this end, we implement the methodology
described in our previous work [19] that builds a machine-learning model to
pinpoint intentionally visited URLs (i.e., webpages) from raw HTTP traces.
The followed strategy has as core module a supervised classifier, which is able to
correctly recognize user actions in HTTP traces. It results to reach an accuracy
of over 98%, and it can be successfully applied to different scenarios, including
smartphone apps [20].
In total, after the extraction, we have 58 million user actions/visited webpages towards 59 989 different adult domains. We observe an average of 13 261
different WP users per month. For each user, we determine information about
used OS, browser, and if the device was a PC, a smartphone, or a tablet. These
information are extracted from the user-agent of the original HTTP request at

the time of the capture, using the Universal Device Detection library.6 We made
these data available to the community in anonymized form to guarantee reproducibility of our results and further investigations [1]. In the remainder of the
paper, we only take into account user actions, to which we simply refer with the
term visited webpages.
3.5

Privacy and ethical concerns

Passive measurements potentially expose information which may threaten users’
privacy. As such, our data collection program has been approved by the partner
ISP and by the ethical board of our University. Moreover, this specific data
analysis project was also subject to a privacy impact assessment that was done
with the data protection officer of our institution.
We undertake several countermeasures to avoid recording any personally
identifiable information. Before any storage, all client identifiers are anonymized
using Crypto-PAn algorithm [7], and URLs are truncated to avoid recording
URL-encoded parameters. Encryption keys are varied on a monthly basis, to
avoid persistent users tracking. Sensitive information such as cookies and Post
data are not monitored at all. Logs are stored in a secured data center in an encrypted format. We emphasize again that in our research we only refer to adult
pornography websites, obtained through open datasets, referring exclusively to
legal content in the territories of EU and USA.

Results

In this section, we report the most significant results emerging from our dataset.
We first focus on the time dimension, showing the evolution of WP consumption
from 2014 to 2017 in terms of quantity and device type. We then focus on users,
characterizing duration and frequency of their WP use. Finally, we provide some
figures about the popularity of services.
4.1

Usage trends

Our first analysis aims at describing WP consumption trends from 2014 to 2017.
In Fig. 1a, we focus on the time spent on WP by monitored users. The blue
(solid), red (dash-dot) and green (dashed) curves report, respectively, the 25th ,
50th and 75th percentiles of the total per-user daily time spent on WP, i.e., the
sum of the duration of all the WP sessions. Curves are calculated only for active
users, i.e., users visiting at least one WP website during one day. Curves are not
continuous, for the lack of data due to outages in out PoP. The outcome shows a
rather stable trend over the observation period, with half of the users spending
less than 18 minutes per day on WP; however almost 25% of users reaches
40 minutes of daily activity. These are day-wise statistics, and do not provide

figures about the repeated use of WP across multiple days by the same user, as
we will see later. Measuring the overall share of users accessing WP portals is
not easy using our data, as a single identifier – the client IP address – identifies a
broadband subscription, potentially shared by multiple users. However, we notice
that every day 12% of subscribers access WP websites, and this value is constant
across years. A further analysis on WP pervasiveness is given in Sec. 4.2.
Those results can be used as a comparison with surveys statistics, fortifying
or confuting what the participants declare. Vaillancourt-Morel et al. [18] study
the characteristics of WP consumers. The majority of the chosen sample uses
WP for recreation only, on average 24 minutes per week, a value consistent but
slightly higher compared to our data.
Then, we investigate the evolution in device categories use (PCs, tablets
and smartphones). We compute, for each device category, its share in terms of
number of sessions. Fig. 1b shows the results. We notice that smartphones (blue
surface), have largely increased their share from 27% to 42% at the expense of
PCs. Tablets pervasiveness, reported in green, is instead rather constant. Not
shown, the evolution of daily time spent with different devices did not changed
too much throughout the years (see Sec. 4.2 for more details).

4.2

Usage frequency, duration and habits

For detailed analyses, we restrict to the last month of our dataset that does not
include nor public holidays nor measurement outages, i.e., October 2016. We
first characterize WP sessions in terms of duration. Fig. 2a shows the empirical
cumulative distribution function (CDF) of session duration, expressed in minutes. The duration is larger for PCs than for tablet and smartphones. While
most of the sessions are rather short, i.e., less than 15 minutes for PCs and 10
for smartphones, we observe sporadic longer sessions up to more than one hour.
We now draw the attention on the number of webpages accessed during WP
sessions, whose CDF is reported in Fig. 2b. Here the difference among devices
is limited, with users accessing in median 5 or 6 webpages in a session, with
28% of them limited to one or two. However, in some cases tens of webpages
are accessed. Similarly, in Fig. 2c we report the distribution of the number of
unique websites accessed during a WP session. Results show that smartphone
users tend to focus on a single WP website at a time (78% of sessions), while
PC users are more prone to visit more websites. For all the devices, very few
sessions include visits to 4 or more different websites. Finally, Fig. 2d reports the
number of daily sessions for an active user. The figure shows that users hardly
make repeated use of WP within a day, without differences among devices.
We next focus on the frequency of WP consumption by users over the month.
In Fig. 3 we report the CDF of number of days of activity for WP users in the
dataset. The figure indicates that the monthly frequency is generally low, with

Fig. 3: Number of distinct days in which users consumed WP in a month.

76% of the users visiting WP 5 or less days in a month. Still, there are some
users with a reiterate usage, with 8% of them consuming WP more than 15 days.
These results confirm what is found by Daspe et al. [5], who show that the 73%
of the participants to a survey access pornography no more than once or twice
per week, and only 11% more than 5 times per week. Given the nature of our
dataset, we cannot estimate the number of users not consuming WP. Still, an
analysis of per-subscription traffic to WP is provided later in this section.
WP consumption also changes during different time of day. Fig. 4 provides the
average percentage of sessions across the 24 hours of the day (red solid line). For
ease of visualization, we start the x-axis from 4am, correspondent to the lowest
value of the day. The two higher peaks are immediately after lunch time (2pm
- 4pm) and after dinner (9pm - midnight). In addition to WP traffic, the figure
also reports the overall trend considering all HTTP transactions, regardless their
nature (dashed blue line). Comparing WP to total traffic, some differences are
noticeable; the peaks do not overlap, and the latter is definitely more balanced
over daylight hours. An hypothesis for those divergences may be related to the
fact that accessing pornographic websites is likely to be a private and leisure
activity confined to intimate moments. At a global scale, Pornhub service has
found similar results.7 The average session time reported by Pornhub for Italy
is 9 minutes and 30 seconds, similar to what observed from our analysis. We
also provide a breakdown across both hours and days of the week, with Fig. 5
showing the heat-map of the percentage variations from the gross weekly average
(white color). Warmer tones register values below average, while colder ones
show values above. Notice some clear diminishing traffic on Saturday evening
(7pm - midnight) and some increasing traffic on Saturday, Sunday and Monday
morning (9am - 1pm). Indeed, many commercial activities are closed on Monday
morning in the monitored country, perhaps influencing this behavior. Again,
Pornhub data shows comparable results, with their heatmap having peaks of
traffic in more or less the same time frames (2pm - 5pm) and (10pm - midnight).

Finally, we provide an overall picture about the fraction of all monitored
subscribers accessing WP website. Although our dataset does not contain finegrained details about WP pervasiveness, we can still show the fraction of subscriptions where at least one user accessed WP during our period of observation. In Fig. 6, the x-axis represents the 31 days of our reference month (being
day 1 October 1st , 2016 and day 31 October 31st , 2016), while y-axis reports
the cumulative fraction of subscriptions that accessed at least one WP website.
Considering a single day, less than 12% of subscriptions accessed WP, but this
fraction raises to 27% after a week. At the end of the month it reaches 38%,
meaning that more than one subscription over three generated traffic toward

WP websites at a glance

In this section, we briefly describe WP website popularity and pervasiveness.
Similarly to the Internet global trend, the market is dominated by few big players. Looking at the Alexa rank,9 three WP websites appear among the top-50,

namely pornhub.com, xvideos.com and livejasmin.com, with the first one
ranked 29th, just behind linkedin.com. Considering our dataset, we observe
a similar situation, with over-the-top companies leading the rank. In Fig. 7 we
show the percentage of users reached by the top-15 WP websites using bars
(left-most y-axis), and the cumulative percentage of visits to these services (red
line, right-most y-axis). In total users accessed 7 048 different websites during the
entire month. The top-3 websites in our dataset match exactly Alexa rank, with
pornhub.com being accessed by 34% of the users. Global tendencies are reflected
in our top-15, with only 2 omitted websites as local representative of the monitored country. Considering the percentage of visited webpages, pornhub.com
alone accounts for 14% of them, and the top-15 together approximately 63%
of all WP visits. The percentage reaches 90% considering the top-204 websites,
confirming the concentration of users around top services. Interestingly, very
similar numbers hold for the overall traffic (including also non-WP websites),
with top-15 accounting for 61% of traffic and 90% due to 195 websites.
Finally, we notice that 3 out of 15 WP websites of Fig. 7 belong to MindGeek,
a company owning pornhub.com, redtube.com, youporn.com, and dozens of
other websites.10 MindGeek websites account for more than 20% of accesses in
our dataset, making it a market leader. For comparison, the second website in
terms of users and visits is xvideos.com (owned by WGCZ Holding), with less
than half the users of MindGeek services, according to our data, suggesting a
scenario where the ecosystem is lead by few big players in a dominant position.

Conclusion

In this paper we offered a quantitative analysis concerning web pornography
consumption. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use network
passive measurements to study the interactions of users with these services.
We followed an exploratory approach on data, focusing on questions, topics and
metrics typically analyzed in previous surveys and research works, e.g., frequency
of fruition and the time spent on WP. We found interesting results, some typical
of the observed population and others capable of confirming global trends.
Our results draw the attention to a large and active group of users, and
may be helpful for researchers that study web services consumption and human
behavior at large. The obtained outcomes can be checked and verified, thanks
to the fact that we release our anonymized dataset. Furthermore, the chosen
metrics allowed a comparison with outcomes of previously conducted surveys,
and mostly confirmed their results.
