Abstract— Mammography is often used as the most common
laboratory method for the detection of breast cancer, yet
associated with the high cost and many side effects. Machine
learning prediction as an alternative method has shown promising
results. This paper presents a method based on a multilayer fuzzy
expert system for the detection of breast cancer using an extreme
learning machine (ELM) classification model integrated with
radial basis function (RBF) kernel called ELM-RBF, considering
the Wisconsin dataset. The performance of the proposed model is
further compared with a linear-SVM model. The proposed model
outperforms the linear-SVM model with RMSE, R2, MAPE equal
to 0.1719, 0.9374 and 0.0539, respectively. Furthermore, both
models are studied in terms of criteria of accuracy, precision,
sensitivity, specificity, validation, true positive rate (TPR), and
false-negative rate (FNR). The ELM-RBF model for these criteria
presents better performance compared to the SVM model.

I. INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is among the most common disease of young
women over the world [1-3]. Approximately 29.9% of mortality
from cancer in women is due to breast cancer. The incidence of
this disease is lower in developing countries than in developed
countries, about 10% of women with breast cancer in Western
countries. However, millions of people over the world are
suffering from this life-threatening disease mortality [3,4]. But
recently, mortality in developed countries has increased, with
global data showing about one million and six hundred thousand
new cases of breast cancer were reported in 2012. Seven

hundred ninety-four thousand people in developed countries
compared to 883,000 people in developing countries, though
198,000 mortalities in developed countries compared to 324,000
people in less developed countries [5]. The increasing global
prevalence of the disease and the resulting death rate can be
attributed to the significant and growing threat in the developing
world. Breast cancer caused by growing out the rule is abnormal
cells in the breast. Cancer can be a common phenomenon in
developing countries, that is, unfortunately, due to changes in
lifestyle as well as hormonal therapies. Early detection of the
disease has a crucial role in reducing mortality. However, the
early treatment also requires early detection of breast cancer at
an initial stage. Most methods for detection of this disease are
performed through surgery or mammography screening and are
costly; countries with good health systems use screening
techniques that will result in high financial costs [6].
Several studies use data mining and artificial intelligence
techniques for diagnosis and detection [7-13]. In 1995, data
mining and machine learning were used in decision-making to
detect breast cancer [14]. Data mining and machine learning
techniques had been in use to enhance the speed and accuracy of
diagnosis [3,15]. However, increasing accuracy to reduce the
RMSE error rate is considered to be a challenge, and this subject
to research is being discussed. Therefore, in this study, we
introduce the multilayer model and investigate the performance
of two important and well-known models. We first label the
dataset using fuzzy logic and then use the proposed ELM and
SVM-based models to classify the best performance between the
two models to detect benign and malignant breast cancer with
the lowest error rate. To evaluate the performance of the

proposed models, we used the confusion matrix. We also applied
the 10-Fold cross-validation technique to obtain the average
accuracy of the models. Once again, the dataset is divided into
three groups of training, testing, and validation that is
investigated evaluation criteria including accuracy, precision,
sensitivity, specificity, validation, false-positive rate and falsenegative rate for the ELM and SVM models that they are very
effective to determine if the performance of these two models.
II. LITERATURE REVIEW
The use of data science and data mining in technology and
machine learning has significantly contributed to medical
science. In recent years, many studies have been done on early
detection and prevention of disease and the selection of suitable
treatment for diseases [16]. Breast cancer of this rule is no
exception, so that much study and research have been done and
continues to be completed in this field. In this section, we briefly
review several studies in the field of breast cancer that is done.
One of the first works to do in this regard can be the decision
tree C4.5 algorithm with a 10-fold cross-validation technique on
the Wisconsin dataset to detect the benign tumors that the
accuracy of detection for this algorithm was computed 94.74%
[17]. The decision tree algorithm was also used to detect the
disease, which was separated from benign and malignant masses
of 92.97% accuracy [18]. Weighted NB is a new method for
classifying breast cancer, which is considered the several
performances of evaluation techniques, including sensitivity,
specificity, and accuracy in [19]. According to the results of the
experiments, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy values
were computed 99.11%, 98.25%, and 98.54%, respectively.
Useful information extraction and tumor detection are
developed using K-means and support vector machine (K-SVM)
algorithms in combination. The detection accuracy of the
proposed method was obtained at 97.38% [20]. In another study,
a new knowledge-based system was used to classify breast
cancer using clustering techniques called ExpectationMaximization (EM) and classification and regression trees
(CART) to generate fuzzy rules on the Wisconsin dataset. The
accuracy computed in this system based on the fuzzy reasoning
method was estimated at 93.20% [21]. Other methods for
detection of breast cancer include the supervised learning
algorithm using a fuzzy clustering algorithm 97.57% accuracy
[22]. Authors in [23] utilized a variety of classification methods,
including SVM, probabilistic neural network (PNN), recurrent
neural network (RNN), combined neural network (CNN), and
Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN) for the
detection of breast cancer, which they were achieved 99.45%,
98.61%, 98.15%, 97.40%, and 91.92%, respectively of
accuracy. The authors were also able to identify benign and
malignant tumors with 98.53% accuracy using the least square
support vector machine (LS-SVM) method [24]. Recently, three
data mining algorithms including Naive Bayes, RBF network,
J48, have been used to predict breast cancer. For this purpose, a
dataset with 683 samples from three continents, including Asia,
Africa, and Latin America was exploited. 10- fold CrossValidation technique was also used to evaluate the models. The
results denote that the Naïve Bayes model is the best predictor
compared to the RBF network and j48 models with an accuracy
of 97.36%, 96.77%, and 93.94%, respectively [25].

III. MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. Data
The study used the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset
(WBCD) for women in the UCI machine learning dataset [26].
This dataset contains 699 records with 16 missing values for the
Bare Nuclei feature taken by Dr. W.H. Wolberg from aspiration
needle at the University of Wisconsin Madison Hospital of
human breast cancer tissue. Depending on the values of these
features, the benign and malignant mass is determined. Also, the
WBCD contains nine features in this dataset. Depending on the
values of these features, the type of benign and malignant mass
is distinguished. In the dataset with 16 missing values, we
discard these missing values in our experiment, and we consider
only the remaining 683 records. From the cleaned dataset, 444
records belonged to the benign class, and the remaining 239
records belonged to the malignant class. Two classes for benign
and malignant breast cancer are classified as classes 2 and 4,
respectively.
B. Methodology
In this research, the proposed system consists of 6 modules,
each module consisting of several phases. It's a multilayer
system. Fig. 1, presents the methodology. In the following, we
will fully describe each module and components performance in
the respective phase. The first module investigates the dataset.
This module is an initial dataset investigate module that is part
of the pre-processing data module. The first module consists of
3 phases. The first phase: captures the data from the dataset. The
second phase analyzes each detail of the data to enhance the
quality of the data. The third phase prepares the data by deleting
noise or non-content data to transfer to the next module. The
flowchart of the 3 phases related to the first module is illustrated
in Fig. 2. After an initial investigation, the confirmed dataset is
stored in a log file, which is cleaned dataset from breast cancer.
The purpose of creating the first module is to perform the
suitable activities based on the steps mentioned on the dataset,
and the result of these activities or processing will be transferred
to the next module after being stored in a log file as input.
In the fuzzy breast cancer detector (FBCD) module, the fuzzy
labeling is used to detect the breast cancer to label data. In other
words, the second module is responsible for labeling the file log,
namely fuzzy labeling. According to the second module, the
purpose of the fuzzy system in analyzing a breast cancer dataset
is to distinguish the benign and malignant outcome of the mass.
Before starting the fuzzy discussion in this study, the input
features must be fuzzification. A range of 1 to 10 is assigned to
each feature that should be medically within the range. The input
variables have been imported to the fuzzification phase. In this
module, input variables are transformed into fuzzy linguistic
variables to facilitate the modeling and extraction of medically
acceptable results. Table. I illustrates a representation of the
linguistic variables for breast cancer disease features with a
range of 1 to 10 designed in this study. According to the dataset,
as well as the fuzzy linguistic variables, we describe the fuzzy
table of the nine features. Therefore, the procedure of the second
module is accomplished through the fuzzy threshold system
after the initial evaluation of the breast cancer dataset, input
selection, data labeling, and detection of benign and malignant
of a cancer mass.

TABLE I.

Fig. 1. Schematic representation of the research method

According to Table. I, the fuzzy linguistic variables include
“Low”, “Medium” and “High”. The numbers range is
considered from 1 to 10 medically. It should be noted that we
use MATLAB software and a fuzzy toolbox to implement the
methods. The fuzzification process for the proposed detection
system is shown in Fig. 3.

LINGUISTIC VARIABLES FOR BREAST CANCER DISEASE
FEATURES WITH THE RANGE .

The first phase is feature extraction for fuzzification to
extract the important features from the Wisconsin dataset.
Several important features in the detection of breast cancer are
analyzed. The dataset is included nine features for breast cancer
such as Clump Thickness, Uniformity of Cell Size, Uniformity
of Cell Shape, Marginal Adhesion, Single Epithelial Cell Size,
Bare Nuclei, Bland Chromatin, Normal Nucleoli, and Mitoses.
In the proposed system, all of these nine features are considered
as crucial input variables. The second phase is Fuzzification
where every crisp input value must be transformed into a fuzzy
variable with respect to the linguistic variables. The fuzzy set
functions are assigned values between 1 and 10, indicating the
membership function of an element in a specific set. The third
phase is the fuzzy interface engine and rule base, where the
database stores fuzzy rules and knowledge of the rules used in
the fuzzy inference engine to obtain a new reality. The fourth
phase is defuzzification.

of breast cancer.

Fig. 2. Flowchart for the first module

In the fuzzification phase, the input variables, which are
numeric and absolute, are transformed into linguistic variables
according to the fuzzy inference engine and fuzzy rules to be
understood, finally being numerically labeled with
defuzzification [27,28]. As shown in Fig. 3, the second module
consists of several phases.

Due to the fuzzy rules applied to the inference engine and
the linguistic variables in output, the defuzzification phase is to
transform the linguistic variables into crisp values. It actually
does numeric labeling. The fifth phase concerns with the output
class where the intelligent analysis and decision-making phase
by the proposed fuzzy system as it deals with the labeling phase,
defuzzification output and with regard to the 9 crucial features
of breast cancer, as well as the fuzzy rules, the relative inputs are
analyzed by the proposed fuzzy system, so that each data has
been its suitable label. The labeled data is then ready to be
transferred to the third module after analyzing the fuzzy system.
The purpose of the third module is to use classification

algorithms to detect and separate benign and malignant breast
cancer tumors. Fig. 4 shows the implementation phases for the
proposed fuzzy system.

performance of each of the SVM and ELM classifiers in this
module. SVM is a supervised learning algorithm based on
statistical learning theory and structural risk minimization that it
is introduced by Vapnik [32]. The SVM is generally used for
problems where there are two classes so that SVM uses an
optimized linear separator hyperplane to create classes, but not
all problems in the main input space can be linearly separated.
Therefore, SVM is a classifier that maps the linear training
patterns into nonlinear patterns in high dimensional feature
space. The linear decision-making function for SVM is as
follows;
𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛(𝑤. ∅(𝑥) + 𝑏)

(1)

The distance between the two classes called margin, in the
2
new feature space is ||𝑤|| . The SVM model attempts to
maximize the margin and minimize the error of the training
data. In this model, the optimization problem is as follows.

The third Module is the Classification of Breast Cancer
Detector (CBCD). The third module includes the phase of
classifying the breast cancer dataset [29] by using an SVM and
a neural network model based on extreme learning capability
namely Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) to detect benign or
malignant type of cancer mass that in this module, dataset is
divided into three groups: training, testing, and validation. The
first group is training. The system training process can be
considered as a search to determine the local minimum of a cost
function (typically the sum of squares of error or the mean of
squares of error). In the training phase, using the training dataset,
the related model is constructed [30-31]. In this study, after
preparing the new data structure file, 70% of the data is applied
to SVM and neural network-based ELM classifiers for training.
To implement the proposed model in MATLAB software, an
input matrix, including nine features, is inserted into the selected
model. The target matrix represented two classes of benign and
malignant mass with 2 and 4 labels, respectively. If the type of
cancer belongs to the relevant class, its rows are filled with 2 and
4 values. The second group is testing. At this phase, after the
trained models, the variables that are considered for testing the
models are applied to the proposed system and their outputs for
computing are investigated and analyzed. The testing dataset is
used to compute the accuracy of the constructed model [30-31].
In this study, 20% of the dataset is used to test and to evaluate
the results of the models. The third group is the validation. In
this study, we used the validation field to compute the validation
of the two SVM and ELM classification models. For this
purpose, we consider 10% of the data for the validation of
models. The fourth module is defining the structure and
performance of the classifiers. We define the structure and

computed as follows [33].

ELM first proposed by Huang et al. [34]. ELM operates on
generalized Single hidden layer feedforward networks (SLFN).
In the ELM model, the hidden layer does not need to be
adjusted, and the functions of this layer, which is a feature
transfer to the new space, are already specified. SVM models,
polynomial neural networks, Radial Basis Function (RBF), and
single-layer feedforward models are a special state of this
model. In kernel-based SVM, PSVM, and LS-SVM methods, it
is first assumed that data is transferred to kernel space. This
space “∅(x)” that maps data from the current space to the new
space is usually unknown and uses the equivalent kernel. This
is performed with the purpose of generalization of these models
to the learning of nonlinear areas. In the current data space,
these models are only able to find linear areas. Transferring to
the kernel space, we actually go into a space that contains
nonlinear elements of the previous space. The decision function
that is ultimately learned in these three methods mentioned
above is as follows;
𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛(∑𝑁
(4)
𝑖=1 𝛼𝑖 𝑡𝑖 𝐾(𝑥, 𝑥𝑖 ) + 𝑏 )
Where “𝑥𝑖 ” is the ith training data and “𝑡𝑖 ” is the label of this
training data (assuming 𝑡𝑖 ∈ {−1, +1} ). The function
“𝐾(𝑥, 𝑥𝑖 )” of the kernel is between the new data “𝑥” and the
training data “𝑥𝑖 ”. There is also the bias “b” for the decisionmaking function. The ELM model was first created for SLFNs

and it was later developed to generalized SLFNs. The decision
function in this model is as follows;

of closely “1” denotes better model efficiency and the higher
correlation between the experimental and the estimated data.

𝑓(𝑥) = ℎ(𝑥)𝛽 = ∑𝐿𝑖=1 𝛽𝑖 ℎ𝑖 (𝑥)

The root-mean-square error (RMSE) is a useful error
criterion for accuracy measurement [36]. The difference is
between the value predicted by the model and the actual value.
Unlike R2, the RMSE should be closer to “0”.

(5)

Where ℎ(𝑥) = [ℎ1 (𝑥), … , ℎ𝐿 (𝑥)] is a transformation to a
new feature space performed by the hidden layer. The vector
𝛽𝛽 = [𝛽1 , … , 𝛽𝐿 ] is the weight vector between the latent layer
and the output layer, which must be learned. Here we can model
the SVM as an ELM that is as follows;
ℎ𝑖 (𝑥) = 𝑡𝑖 𝐾(𝑥, 𝑥𝑖 ), 𝑖 = 1,2, … . , 𝑁

, ℎ0 (𝑥) = 1

(6)

Therefore, by considering the above transformation and the
optimization problem for the ELM model such that the weights
equal to 𝛽 = [𝑏, 𝛼1 , … , 𝛼𝑁 ] are found, we can find the SVM
model equivalent to SVM. As with SVM-based models, if the
feature mapping is unknown to us, kernels can also be used in
ELM models. In this state, the ELM kernel is defined as
follows.
𝛺𝐸𝐿𝑀 = 𝐻𝐻 𝑇 : 𝛺𝐸𝐿𝑀 𝑖,𝑗 = ℎ(𝑥𝑖 ). ℎ(𝑥𝑗 ) = 𝐾(𝑥𝑖 , 𝑥𝑗 )
(7)
In this state, the model output function can be computed by the
kernel as follows [26].

Also, in this study, the radial basis function (RBF) is selected
as the kernel function as denoted below, where σ is the radius

In this study, the evaluation metrics of MAPE, RMSE, R2,
confusion matrix and 10-fold cross-validation methods are
used. R2 is the quantity called the coefficient of determination
so that it is computed as the ratio of the changes defined to the
total changes. In other words, this coefficient indicates that
“how much of the dependent variable changes are affected by
the relevant independent variable” [35]. The coefficient of
determination, whatever be closer to “1”, the relative model is
more efficient. The value of “R2” is computed as follows.
R2 =

In (10), xi , x̅i , xj and x̅j are denoted the values estimated by
the model, the average of the values estimated by the model, the

where n is the number of records. Also, , xj is the actual

and it is defined by the following equation [37].

To evaluate the performance of the SVM and ELM models
in more detail, the confusion matrix is used as illustrated in
TABLE. II. Using this matrix, the value of each criterion is
computed and then the results are compared. This matrix is a
useful tool for analyzing the performance of classification
models in detecting data in different classes [15,38].

For the evaluation of the expressed models, a confusion

predictive records. FP: False positive, indicating the number of
positive predictive records that are incorrectly classified as
negative. FN: False-negative, indicating the number of negative
predictive records that are incorrectly classified as positive.
TN: True negative indicates the number of correctly classified
negative predictive records. The 10-Fold Cross-Validation
[39], divided data into ten subsets. Then they are processed ten
times. In this process, seven datasets for training, 2 subsets for
testing and one remaining subset for validation are used.
Therefore, the average accuracy computed with ten iterations is
computed using 10-fold cross-validation.

The results are extracted to decide regarding be benign or

results of the classification models according to RMSE, R2, and

After observing the results of the evaluation criteria, we
concluded that ELM-RBF had the best classification result. As
stated earlier the has been divided to 70% for training, 20% for
testing, and 10% for validation of dataset. Furthermore, several
criteria were used to compare the models, including accuracy
in training and testing, precision, sensitivity, specificity,
validation, false-positive rate, and false-negative rate. The (13)(18) are calculated as follows.
Specificity = True Negative Rate (TNR) = TN / TN + FP (13)

The performance results of two classification algorithms were
compared on 9 features including Clump Thickness,
Uniformity of Cell Size, Uniformity of Cell Shape, Marginal
Adhesion, Single Epithelial Cell Size, Bare Nuclei, Bland
Chromatin, Normal Nucleoli and Mitoses. We found acceptable
results for breast cancer in the Wisconsin dataset. The results of
the experiment using the confusion matrix for criteria of
accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, validation, false
positive rate and false negative rate demonstrate that the
proposed ELM model has better performance than SVM model.
We used the 10-fold cross-validation technique in this study so
that the average accuracy computed for the models using this
evaluation technique demonstrates that the proposed model has
a detection accuracy of 98.05. While the accuracy of the SVM
model is 90.56%. A comparison of the results for the two
models for the criteria mentioned in Fig. 5 is shown.

Fig. 5. Comparison of classification results according to the evaluation criteria
of models.

According to the analysis demonstrated in Fig. 5, we found that
the ELM model has better performance than the SVM model
with 9 features in all criteria, so that for the ELM-RBF model
the accuracy is computed 99.23% in the test phase and the
accuracy of this model is computed 99.72% in the training
phase. However, for the SVM model, the accuracy was
computed 92.17% and 94.38% in the test phase and in the
training phase, respectively. Also, the validation measurement
of the ELM and SVM models were computed 95.69 and 88.93,
respectively. Besides, the FPR measurement for the ELM-RBF
model is 5.61 versus the SVM model which is 16.48 and the
FNR measurement for the ELM and SVM models is 2.44 and
9.72, respectively.
V. CONCLUSION
A Multilayer Fuzzy Expert System of ELM-RBF proposed
on the Wisconsin dataset for breath cancer detection. This model
was compared with the SVM model. The performance of the
classifiers was evaluated according to fuzzy labeled data. Then,
the best classifier was distinguished to be benign and malignant
of cancer mass. With this hybrid method, an efficient prediction
model was determined to identify the type of cancer mass. For
this purpose, the cleaned dataset consists of 683 records divided
into 3 sections; training, testing and validation so that 70% of
the data for training, 20% for testing and 10% for model
validation were considered. We used three criteria for evaluation
such as RMSE, R2 and MAPE to the detection of breast cancer.
The results demonstrate that the proposed model has the best
performance than SVM according to tables 2 to 4. Also, the
average accuracy computed using the 10-fold cross validation
technique for the ELM-RBF model has been 98.05. However,
the accurate measurement for the SVM model has been 90.56.
Another important achievement of this study is that we use the
confusion matrix to evaluate the relevant models, which
demonstrates that the proposed ELM-RBF model is better than
the SVM model in terms of criteria of accuracy, precision,
sensitivity, specificity, validation, false positive rate and false
negative rate. So, by dividing the dataset into three groups of
training, testing and validation, the accuracy of training and
testing as well as validation for the ELM-RBF model were
99.72, 99.23 and 95.69%, respectively, and these measurements
for the SVM model were 94.38 for training, 92.17% for testing
and 88.93% for validation. Among these criteria, the FPR

criterion is more important than the FNR criterion for clinical
centers so that the FPR measurement of 5.61 versus the SVM
model of 16.48. The comparison of the mentioned classification
results according to the evaluation criteria of models is provided.
Therefore, the proposed fuzzy ELM-RBF model can replace
medical invasive diagnostic methods, as it can distinguish
patients who do not require sampling and testing with high
accuracy. This method of early and accurate detection very
crucial because it avoids the necessary complications and high
costs in detecting the disease of breast cancer.
