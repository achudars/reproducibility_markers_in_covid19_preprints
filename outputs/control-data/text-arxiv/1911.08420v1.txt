Quantum error correction is of crucial importance for fault-tolerant quantum computers. As
an essential step towards the implementation of quantum error-correcting codes, quantum nondemolition (QND) measurements [1–3] are needed to efficiently detect the state of a logical qubit
without destroying it [4–10]. Here we implement QND measurements in a Si/SiGe two-qubit system
[11], with one qubit serving as the logical qubit and the other serving as the ancilla. Making use of a
two-qubit controlled-rotation gate, the state of the logical qubit is mapped onto the ancilla, followed
by a destructive readout of the ancilla. Repeating this procedure enhances the logical readout fidelity
from 75.5 ± 0.3% to 94.5 ± 0.2% after 15 ancilla readouts. In addition, we compare the conventional
thresholding method with an improved signal processing method called soft decoding that makes use
of analog information in the readout signal to better estimate the state of the logical qubit [12]. We
demonstrate that soft decoding leads to a significant reduction in the required number of repetitions
when the readout errors become limited by Gaussian noise, for instance in the case of readouts with
a low signal-to-noise ratio. These results pave the way for the implementation of quantum error
correction with spin qubits in silicon.

The compatibility of spin qubits with industrial semiconductor technology as well as their relatively small size
makes them scalable to large dense arrays [13, 14] and
facilitates the implementation of fault-tolerant quantum
computing based on quantum error correction. A key requirement of quantum error correction is the ability to repeatedly measure multiple physical qubits in a quantum
non-demolition (QND) way to identify logical errors [15].
One approach to achieve quantum non-demolition readout of spin qubits is to use a two-qubit gate to map the
state of the logical qubit to an ancilla which is then measured. While the readout of the ancilla may be destructive, it leaves the state of the original qubit unperturbed.
Consequently, the ancilla may be reinitialized and the
logical qubit measurement can be repeated to enhance
the signal. Recently, ancilla-based repetitive QND readout has been implemented across several platforms, from
trapped ions [4, 5] to electron-nuclear spin systems [6–8]
and superconducting qubits [9, 10]. In GaAs quantum
dots, repeated non-destructive readout of spin states [16]
as well as QND measurement of a spin qubit [17] have
been reported. In the latter experiment, however, the information had to be decoded from the evolution of the ancilla qubit under a two-qubit controlled-phase operation
with variable interaction time to overcome the fluctuations of the Overhauser field. This makes the cumulative
fidelity only slowly increase with the number of QND

readouts. In addition, the binary thresholding of individual measurements in these experiments discards valuable information. Furthermore, future experiments on
large arrays of spin qubits will likely rely on gate-based
dispersive readout, where it is challenging to achieve a
high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) [18–21]. Consequently,
both a repetitive QND readout with uniform repetitions
and improved decoding methods are highly desirable for
quantum error correction. In particular, “soft decoding”
makes full use of the analog information contained in
the successive measured detector responses. Such analog
information was previously used in trapped ion experiments [5] and can lead to a more efficient readout of the
logical qubit [12].
Here we use two electron spin qubits in a double quantum dot (DQD) confined in a Si/SiGe heterostructure.
The sample and qubit control techniques are described
in detail in Ref. [11]. In brief, single-qubit gates are realized by electric-dipole spin resonance (EDSR) enabled
by the magnetic field gradient from a nearby micromagnet [22, 23]. The micromagnet gradient also causes the
resonance frequencies of the two qubits to be well separated. A two-qubit gate is realized by changing the detuning between the chemical potentials of the two dots,
which modifies the strength of the exchange interaction,
J, between the two spins. Due to the interplay of the
exchange and the energy difference between the qubits,
the energies of the |01i and |10i states are shifted down
by J/2, because of their coupling to the doubly-occupied
singlet state, S(0,2) (Fig. 1(b)). Consequently, the EDSR
resonance frequency of qubit 2 (Q2) depends on the state
of qubit 1 (Q1). By applying an EDSR pulse at the resonance frequency of Q2 corresponding to a particular Q1

FIG. 1. a. Charge stability diagram of the DQD and of the pulsing scheme used in the experiment. The current through a
sensing quantum dot is shown in color scale as a function of two gate voltages that control the electrochemical potentials of the
two dots. The gate voltages for steps 1 through 5 in the experiment (discussed in the main text) are indicated with black circles,
which also appear in panels c and d. We note that the DQD remains in the (1,1) state during step 5 (the CROT gate) because
the operation is much faster than the tunneling-out time of Q1. b. Spin states of the two-electron system with and without
exchange coupling. The spin state of Q1 is mapped onto the spin state of Q2 via a CROT gate based on frequency-selective
spin transitions. c. Quantum circuit for the QND readout procedure. Q1 is used as a logical qubit and as control qubit of the
CROT gate, while Q2 is used as ancilla qubit and as target qubit of the CROT gate. An optional Xπ pulse is used to prepare Q1
into the spin-up state following initialization to spin-down. d. Schematic representation of the DQD system during the QND
measurement protocol. Initialization and readout are implemented by aligning the electrochemical potential of the last electron
in dot 2 close to the Fermi energy of the reservoir. The exchange coupling is switched on by detuning the electrochemical
potentials of dots 1 and 2. Both electrochemical potentials are varied by applying voltage pulses on the depletion gates that
define the DQD confining potential. Spin-flips in single- and two-qubit gates are implemented by EDSR.

= α |0iQ1 |0iQ2 + β |1iQ1 |1iQ2

Due to the low concentration of nuclear spins in silicon,
the mapping from logical qubit to ancilla is close to optimal in every single repetition. In the QND readout
experiment, we choose Q1 (shown in blue in the figures)
as the logical qubit and Q2 (shown in red) as the ancilla qubit. We do this for two reasons. First, Q1 has a
much longer T1 than Q2 (T1 > 50 ms versus T1 ≈ 1 ms),
allowing multiple readout cycles of Q1 before significant
relaxation occurs. Second, Q2 is physically closer to the
Fermi reservoir, which makes it easier to perform destructive readout and reinitialization. Here, the readout of Q2
is performed by detecting spin-selective tunneling to the

reservoir with the help of a charge sensor [24]. The signature of the spin-up state is the appearance of a step
in the charge sensor response as only a spin-up electron
tunnels out of the quantum dot. A commonly used [24]
and near-optimal [25] strategy to detect such a step is
to compare the peak value Ip of the charge sensor signal during the readout time to a fixed threshold (see
Fig. 3c inset for an example of a charge sensor trace).
In the data shown below, we infer the spin states using a
readout time that minimizes the average single-repetition
readout error rate [26].
We test the QND readout through a protocol whereby
voltage pulses applied to two of the quantum dot gate
electrodes take the system through the following steps
(see Figs. 1a,c,d). 1) Empty dot 2, 2) initialize Q1 to the
spin-down state via spin relaxation at a hotspot [27], 3)
initialize Q2 in the spin-down state using spin-selective

FIG. 2. a. Circuit diagram for the repetitive QND readout
scheme, using the same labels as in Fig. 1c. b. Spin-up probability obtained from individual QND readout cycles (triangles) and from a cumulative weighted majority vote (circles)
for preparation of Q1 in state |1i (blue) and in state |0i (red).
For the individual readout cycles, the visibility does not improve and in fact slightly decreases due to the finite relaxation
time T1 of Q1. By fitting the measured P1 for preparation of
Q1 in state |1i to an exponential, we estimate T1 = 1.8±0.6 s.
The cumulative weighted majority vote improves the logical
readout visibility as more QND readout cycles are performed.

tunneling, 4) an optional single-qubit π-pulse for initialization of Q1 in the spin-up state, 5) a CROT gate to map
the state of Q1 onto the state of Q2 and 6) single-shot
readout of Q2. Step 6 occurs at the same gate voltages
as step 3), so at the end of the sequence, Q2 is automatically reinitialized through spin-selective tunneling. In
successive QND measurements, steps 1, 2 are omitted,
and the optional rotation at step 4 is omitted as well
(Fig. 2(a)). Each readout cycle lasts 3.263 ms. Because
the CROT gate does not affect the state of Q1, successive
cycles each yield information on the state of Q1 before
the first cycle, as long as Q1 has not been flipped due to
relaxation or excitation. Therefore, the readout fidelity
of the logical qubit Q1 can be significantly enhanced by
repeating the readout cycle. In order to obtain directly
the visibility from experiment, we prepare Q1 either in
state |0i or in state |1i. We then perform up to 15 sequential QND measurements.
The simplest way to infer the state of Q1 from the repeated readout of Q2 is to perform a majority vote on the
readout outcomes [28]. Ideally, this leads to an exponential suppression of the logical readout error probability
log with the number of cycles N , log ∝ N . Here,  is
the single-repetition readout error rate.
A slightly more sophisticated approach to inferring the
state of Q1 is through a weighted majority vote that
accounts for spin relaxation (see Methods for full details [26]). Intuitively, the later measurement cycles have

accumulated more errors from relaxation than the earlier
ones, and are thus given less weight. Fig. 2(b) shows the
estimated spin-up probability of Q1 for each individual
QND readout cycle as well as for a cumulative weighted
majority vote. The cumulative visibility increases from
51.0 ± 0.6% after 1 cycle to 88.9 ± 0.3% after 15 cycles, which corresponds to a cumulative logical fidelity
of 94.5 ± 0.2%. Here, the logical fidelity is defined as
F log = 1 − log [26]. The oscillation in the cumulative
spin-up probabilities is due to an even-odd effect from
(weighted) majority voting. Due to spin relaxation of
Q1, there is a slow decay of the (single-repetition) spinup probability when Q1 is prepared in |1i. Previous T1
measurements on the same device shows that there was
no observable decay of Q1 up to 50ms [11], consistent
with our observations. From the data, it is clear that
even higher cumulative fidelities can be achieved using
more repetitions (see [26] for a detailed discussion).
Further improvements in the readout fidelity for repeated QND readout are possible when taking into
account additional information contained in the individual read-out traces. This approach is based on
the log-likelihood ratio for the logical state, λlog =
PN
i=1 λ(Oi ) [29] (in the data analysis below, we use a
slightly more sophisticated variant, accounting for relaxation of Q1 during the repeated measurements [26]).
Here, Oi is the measurement outcome for the ith repetition and λ(Oi ) = ln [P (Oi |1)/P (Oi |0)] is the loglikelihood ratio for that outcome. P (Oi |1) (P (Oi |0)) is
the probability to obtain Oi when the qubit is prepared
in |1i (|0i). If λlog > 0 (λlog < 0), it is decided that
the most likely pre-measurement logical state is |1i (|0i).
When thresholding, the observable Oi is either a 1 or a
0, an approach we call ‘hard decoding’. When considering only a single readout instance, thresholding is optimal. For the repetitive QND readout discussed here, but
also for quantum error correction in general, thresholding each individual qubit readout leads to an irreversible
loss of information because it discards the level of confidence λ(Oi ) that can be assigned to individual readout
outcomes [12, 30–32]. A better approach is to take an
analog variable as the observable Oi to calculate λlog .
For the readout scheme used here, the peak signal is a
good choice [25]. We refer to this procedure as ‘soft decoding’.
The logical readout error probabilities resulting from
hard and soft decoding applied to our raw data are plotted in Fig. 3(c) as a function of the number of QND readout cycles. Interestingly, in this instance, the improvement of soft decoding over hard decoding is almost nonexistent. This can be understood by examining the empirically measured peak-signal distributions P (Ip |1) and
P (Ip |0) at the optimal readout time (∼ 623 µs, see Methods [26]) shown in Fig. 3(a) along with the log-likelihood
ratio λ(Ip ). Since readout errors caused by noise in the
readout traces are small compared to the bit flip errors
arising from imperfect CROT operations, ancilla preparation, and spin-to-charge conversion in the readout of

FIG. 3. a. Empirically measured distributions P (Ip |1) and P (Ip |0) of the peak sensing dot signal Ip for preparation of Q1
in |1i (blue histograms) and in |0i (yellow histograms), respectively. The distributions are obtained for the readout time that
minimizes the single-repetition readout error (see Methods [26]). Due to the bimodal features of the two distributions, the
log-likelihood ratio λ(Ip ) is approximately a step function (magenta curve). b. Same dataset as in panel a but with artificially
added Gaussian white noise. Here, the two distributions largely overlap. As a result, the log-likelihood ratio λ(Ip ) is not a step

thresholded at each cycle, useful information is discarded. c, d. Logical readout error rate without and with artificially added
white noise. When the log-likelihood ratio λ(Ip ) approximates a step function, there is little advantage in using soft decoding.

required to achieve a given error rate. Insets: example readout traces containing a tunnel event without/with added Gaussian

the ancilla spin, the peak-signal distributions have clear
bimodal features (this is discussed in more detail below).
As a result, λ(Ip ) approximates a step function. This
means that all values of Ip on one side of the step are assigned the same level of confidence. It follows that thresholding the values of Ip does not discard much information
on the level of confidence in each readout outcome.
For soft decoding to yield an advantage, we must therefore consider situations where λ(Ip ) is not a step function.
One such generic situation occurs in the limit of low SNR
for the single-repetition readout. To demonstrate that
soft decoding yields an advantage for low SNR, we artificially add Gaussian white noise on top of the experimental readout traces. Fig. 3(d) shows the resulting logical
error probabilities for both hard and soft decoding. We
see that soft decoding achieves the same logical error rate
with 10 repetitions instead of 15 repetitions, a reduction
by a third in the number of repetitions. Consequently, a
significant amount of readout time may be saved. The
reason for this advantage is apparent in Fig. 3(b), which

shows the probability distributions P (Ip |1) and P (Ip |0)
and the corresponding λ(Ip ) after adding the noise (optimal readout time ∼ 475µs). Here, the distributions are
close to unimodal Gaussians and strongly overlap. This
results in a λ(Ip ) that varies smoothly with Ip such that
values of Ip on a given side of the threshold are given
different levels of confidence. This is the additional information that yields the soft decoding advantage.
It is important to note that the low-SNR readout is not
merely of theoretical interest but is also of great practical relevance. One reason is that it might be difficult to
achieve high-SNR in dense qubit arrays where charge sensors, electron reservoirs, or on-chip resonators [20, 21] are
not available, and where only gate-based readout [18–21]
with SNR limited by a large parasitic capacitance [18, 19]
is possible. It also opens the possibilities to achieve
high-fidelity readout at temperature above 1K [33, 34],
which is essential to the integration of quantum dots with
cryo-electronics [35]. Such situations are precisely the
ones where repetitive QND readout may become neces-

5
sary to achieve low logical readout error rates. Moreover, there are situations where relaxing the constraints
on SNR could be beneficial. For instance, it may allow the repetitive readout to operate at lower detectorqubit coupling without loss of fidelity, which could reduce unwanted interference of the detector on the system. Note that these advantages are not limited to the
special case of the repetitive QND readout considered
here. For instance, quantum error-correcting codes infer error syndromes by using both spatial and temporal
redundancy from repeated measurement of multiple ancillas [36]. Both our results and recent theoretical work
on continuous-variable quantum error correction [37–40]
suggest that soft-decoding of quantum codes could help
reduce the number of physical qubits and the number of
measurements required to achieve a desired logical error
rate.
It must also be emphasized that a low SNR is in general not necessary to benefit from soft decoding. Soft decoding helps when errors arising from noise, as small as
they may be, are larger than bit flip errors. This ensures
that the log-likelihood ratio changes smoothly instead of
step-wise [12]. We discuss ways to engineer such conditions for readout of spin qubits in quantum dots in the
supplementary information.

out traces are far less frequent than errors from bit flips.
However, with the same rate of bit-flip errors, soft decoding is expected to significantly reduce the number of
ancilla measurements required for high-fidelity readout
when the SNR is low, as can be the case for gate-based
readout in dense qubit arrays, for readout at elevated
temperatures, or when SNR must be traded for readout
speed.
Note added.—During the preparation of this
manuscript, we became aware of related work on
repeated QND readout of a silicon spin qubit using the
thresholding technique [41].

In conclusion, we have performed high-fidelity QND
readout of a spin qubit in silicon. The readout fidelity
is enhanced by repeatedly mapping the qubit state to
a nearby ancilla using a two-qubit gate and measuring
the ancilla, from 75.5 ± 0.3% for a single repetition to
94.5 ± 0.2% for 15 repetitions, and with room for further improvements from additional repetitions [26]. We
compared two different decoding methods, hard decoding and soft decoding, and discussed the conditions under which soft decoding yields a significant advantage. In
the present experiment, hard decoding and soft decoding
perform equally well since errors from noise in the read-

BAYESIAN INFERENCE

In this section, we give an algorithm to efficiently perform optimal Bayesian inference of
the logical qubit state using the empirically determined statistics of the repetitive readout.

A.

Repetitive readout

Suppose that the logical qubit is repetitively read out N times, with each repetition
having a duration δtrep . We may consider the state of the logical qubit at the discrete times:
tk = k δtrep ,

k = 0, 1, ..., N,

(S1)

with the k th repetition taking place in the interval [tk−1 , tk ]. Here, the coherence of the logical
qubit in the computational basis plays no role in the statistics of the measurement. For the
present purposes, we may therefore model the time evolution of the logical qubit classically.
The classical state of the logical qubit at time tk is labeled xk . The state evolution of the
logical qubit up to k ≤ N repetitions follows the stochastic time series:
Xk = {x0 , x1 , . . . , xk } .

(S2)

In reality, each individual readout is noisy. Thus, the state xk at each repetition is not
directly recorded. Instead, a noisy observation Ok is recorded. This gives the observation
sequence:
Ok = {O0 , O1 , . . . , Ok−1 } .

(S3)

Note that in general, the observations Ok need not be scalar.
B.

Maximum-likelihood decision

Our goal is to infer the most likely initial state of the logical qubit from the sequence Ok
of noisy repetitive readout outcomes. This is most easily done by calculating the posterior
probability ratio:
P (x0 = 1|Ok )
P (Ok |x0 = 1) P (x0 = 1)
=
.
P (x0 = 0|Ok )
P (Ok |x0 = 0) P (x0 = 0)
2

(S4)

The initial state is most likely 1 if the ratio is larger than unity, and it is most likely 0 if the
ratio is smaller than unity. In the absence of prior information on the logical qubit state,
P (x0 = 0) = P (x0 = 1) = 1/2, the above maximum a posteriori decision [1] reduces to
calculating the log-likelihood ratio:
λlog
k = ln

P (Ok |x0 = 1)
.
P (Ok |x0 = 0)

(S5)

log
The initial state is now most likely 1 if λlog
k > 0, and it is most likely 0 if λk < 0. This

results in a maximum-likelihood decision [1].

Here, log

An experimental estimate of the logical readout error rate log

the logical qubit in state |1i (|0i) 104 times, measuring the record Ok and calculating λlog
k

log
for each attempt, and counting the number of times where λlog
k < 0 (λk > 0). Finally, we

note that the average readout fidelity quoted in the main text is defined as F log = 1 − log ,

while the logical visibility is V log = 1 − 2log .
D.

Calculating the log-likelihood ratio

To calculate λlog
k , the statistics of the observations Ok given the initial state of the logical qubit must be known. More precisely, the probability distributions P (Ok |x0 = 1) and
P (Ok |x0 = 0) appearing in Eq. (S5) must be calculated. In the following, we show how to
model and calculate these distributions for the repetitive readout using the theory of hidden
Markov models [2–6]. The hidden Markov model provides a direct connection between the
3

single-repetition probability distributions, P (Ok |xk ), and the probability distributions for
the full measurement record, P (Ok |x0 ), accounting for the dynamics of the logical qubit.
From P (Ok |x0 ), the log-likelihood ratio can be evaluated directly using Eq. (S5). As described in Sec. II, following Eq. (S28), here we have determined P (Ok |xk ) empirically. However, note that these distributions can also be found from an appropriate dynamical model
of the readout. See for instance Refs. [7–11] and others, where hidden Markov models are
used to determine P (Ok |xk ) at the level of a single repetition.
1.

Hidden Markov models

As discussed in the main text, the logical qubit state evolves during the measurement
via spin relaxation on a time scale T1 . Such a process is Markovian in the sense that the
statistics of the state at time tk+1 are fully determined by the state at time tk :
P (xk+1 |Xk ) = P (xk+1 |xk ).

(S8)

Because the ancilla qubit is reinitialized after each repetition, the noisy observations Ok are
independent from each other and depend only on the state of the logical qubit at time tk :
P (Ok |Xk ) =

k−1
Y
l=0

P (Ol |xl ).

(S9)

In other words, the observation noise is white. Finally, prior knowledge about the system
state at each time is specified by the prior probability distribution P (xk ) for the state xk at
each time tk . The set {P (xk+1 |xk ), P (Ok |xk ), P (xk )} defines a ‘Hidden Markov Model’.
2.

Forward filtering

For the hidden Markov models discussed above, the log-likelihood ratio may be calculated
with the help of an iterative forward filtering algorithm for the logical qubit state [2–8, 10–
12]. Forward filtering consists in calculating the probability distribution of the logical qubit
state xk at time tk given all previous observations. We denote this probability distribution
as
%k (xk ) = P (xk |Ok ).
4

(S10)

Using Bayes’ rule, the distribution %k (xk ) may be rewritten as
%k (xk ) =
Here,

`k (xk )
P (xk , Ok )
P (xk , Ok )
=P
.
=P
P (Ok )
y P (y, Ok )
y `k (y)
`k (xk ) = P (xk , Ok )

(S11)

(S12)

is the joint probability distribution of the state xk and of the previous observations. One
advantage of calculating `k (xk ) instead of %k (xk ) is that `k (xk ) obeys a linear recurrence
relation while %k (xk ) obeys a non-linear recurrence relation (see Sec. I D 3).
We note that the denominator in Eq. (S11) is the likelihood function
Lk = P (Ok ) =

X

`k (xk ).

(S13)

xk

Eq. (S11) now takes the form
`k (xk ) = %k (xk ) × Lk .

(S14)

It is convenient to introduce the vector notation
|%k ) =

X
x

%k (x) |x) , |`k ) =

X
x

`k (x) |x) ,

(S15)

where {|x)} is a set of basis vectors representing the classical logical qubit states x. Eq. (S14)
is then rewritten as
|`k ) = Lk × |%k ) .

(S16)

The likelihood function, Eq. (S13), may compactly be written as
Lk = Tr |`k ) .

(S17)

Here, the trace Tr of a vector is the sum of its elements. Choosing the basis {|1) , |0)}, the
likelihood function may be calculated for the initial states x0 = 1 and x0 = 0 of the logical
qubit by setting |%0 ) = |`0 ) = (1, 0)T and |%0 ) = |`0 ) = (0, 1)T , respectively. This enables
the maximum-likelihood decision discussed following Eq. (S5).
5

3.

The filtering equations

For completeness, we now derive the recurrence relation for forward filtering of hidden
Markov models. We note that
`k+1 (xk+1 ) = P (xk+1 , Ok+1 ) =

X
xk

=

X
xk

P (xk+1 , Ok+1 |xk )P (xk )
(S18)
P (Ok+1 |xk+1 , xk )P (xk+1 |xk )P (xk ).

Next we recall that 1) Ok+1 = {O1 , O2 , . . . , Ok } does not depend on xk+1 by causality and
that 2) the observation noise is white, Eq. (S9). Thus, we have
X
`k+1 (xk+1 ) =
P (Ok+1 |xk )P (xk+1 |xk )P (xk )
xk

=

X
xk

=

X
xk

P (Ok |xk )P (Ok |xk )P (xk+1 |xk )P (xk )

(S19)

P (Ok |xk )P (xk+1 |xk )`k (xk ).

This recurrence relation may be written in vector form
|`k+1 ) = Vk (Ok ) |`k ) .

(S20)

Here, we have introduced the matrix Vk (Ok ) with elements
(x| Vk (Ok ) |y) = P (xk+1 |yk )P (Ok |yk ) = wkxy Pky (Ok ),

(S21)

and we have defined
wkxy = P (xk+1 |yk ),
Pkx (Ok ) = P (Ok |xk ).

(S22)

The matrix wkxy describes the transition probabilities for the evolution of the logical qubit
state and the vector Pkx (Ok ) describes the observation noise for each logical qubit state.
Note that there exist corresponding recurrence relations for the state vector |%k ) and for the
likelihood function Lk . They take the form
|%k+1 ) =

1
Nk+1

|%̃k+1 ) , Lk+1 = Nk+1 × Lk ,

(S23)

where
|%̃k+1 ) = Vk (Ok ) |%k ) , Nk+1 = Tr |%̃k+1 ) .
6

(S24)

4.

Numerical algorithm

We now provide an efficient numerical algorithm for forward filtering. The algorithm
simultaneously calculates the probability vector |%k ) and the log-likelihood function ln Lk as
follows:
1. Set k = 0.
2. Calculate the matrix Vk (Ok ).
3. Calculate |%̃k+1 ) = Vk (Ok ) |%k ).
4. Calculate the norm Nk+1 = Tr |%̃k+1 ).
5. Update the probability distribution |%k+1 ) = |%̃k+1 ) /Nk+1 .
6. Update the log-likelihood ratio with ln Lk+1 = ln Lk + ln Nk+1 .
7. Increase k by one and start again.
Note that we are only interested in estimating the initial state of the logical qubit. Therefore,
the matrix Vk (Ok ) may be normalized at each step by any constant factor independent of
the qubit state without affecting the maximum-likelihood estimate. In some cases, this may
prevent the values of the log-likelihood function from becoming too large.

II.

REPETITIVE READOUT STATISTICS

The hidden Markov model relevant for the repetitive readout discussed in the main text
is obtained by specifying the transition matrix wk and the noise vector Pk appearing in
Eq. (S22).
As discussed in the main text, the qubit undergoes relaxation to its spin ground state on
a time scale T1 . We obtain the value of T1 by simultaneously fitting the measured singlerepetition probabilities P1 and P0 shown in Fig. 2b to an expression of the form
P1 (t) = A−t/T1 + B,

(S25)

for the case when Q1 is prepared in |1i before the first measurement cycle, and of the form
P0 (t) = B.
7

(S26)

for the case when Q1 is initially prepared in |0i. Here, t is the total readout time after the
beginning of the repetitive readout and A and B are constants. The fit is shown in Fig. 2b
and yields T1 = 1.8 ± 0.6s. For a relaxation process, the transition matrix wkxy in the basis
{|1) , |0)} takes the form:

Here, δtrep = 3.263 ms.



wk = exp 

−1 0





 δtrep  .
T1
1 0

(S27)

The noise vector Pky (Ok ) describing the distribution of the outcome Ok for each logical
qubit state is given by


Pk (Ok ) = 

P (Ok |xk = 1)
P (Ok |xk = 0)



.

(S28)

Here, P (Ok |xk = 1) and P (Ok |xk = 0) are the probability distributions of the readout
outcome Ok for preparation of the logical qubit in states 1 and 0, respectively. For the soft
decoding procedure discussed in the main text, the readout outcome Ok is taken to be the
peak signal Ip (see Sec. III). The distributions of outcomes conditioned on the logical qubit
state are then simply the empirically observed distributions of the peak signal P (Ip |xk = 1)
and P (Ip |xk = 0) displayed in Figs. 3a-b of the main text. For the hard decoding procedure,
the readout outcome Ok is taken to be the binary value 1 or 0 obtained by thresholding
the peak signal at each repetition. The distributions of outcomes conditioned on the logical
qubit state are then given by the conditional single-repetition readout error rates 1 and 0 :
P (1|xk = 1) = 1 − 1 , P (1|xk = 0) = 0 ,
P (0|xk = 0) = 1 − 0 .

P (0|xk = 1) = 1 ,

(S29)

The procedure used to obtain the distributions P (Ip |xk = 1) and P (Ip |xk = 0) and the
conditional single-repetition readout error rates 1 and 0 is detailed in Sec. III.

III.

SINGLE-REPETITION READOUT CALIBRATION

Since all repetitions are identical, we use the first repetition to calibrate the singlerepetition readout. At t0 = 0, the logical qubit is prepared 104 times in state x0 = 1 and
104 times in state x0 = 0. For each preparation, a readout trace I(t) is recorded for a total
8

time of 2.01 ms in steps of δt = 16.38 µs. For all readout times tR ≤ 2.01 ms, we extract the
peak signal Ip = maxt I(t) [13] and construct the probability distributions of Ip conditioned
on the logical qubit state, P (Ip |x0 = 1) and P (Ip |x0 = 0). For a given readout time tR ,
single-repetition readout is performed by calculating the single-repetition log-likelihood ratio
λ(Ip ) = ln

P (Ip |x0 = 1)
.
P (Ip |x0 = 0)

(S30)

If λ(Ip ) > 0 [λ(Ip ) < 0], we decide that the qubit state is most likely |1i [|0i]. Therefore, the
single-repetition readout error rates 1 and 0 for each state are obtained from marginals of
the distributions P (Ip |x0 = 1) and P (Ip |x0 = 0) as follows:
1 = P (λlog < 0|x0 = 1) =

X

{Ip |λ(Ip )<0}

0 = P (λlog > 0|x0 = 0) =

X

{Ip |λ(Ip )>0}

P (Ip |x0 = 1),
(S31)
P (Ip |x0 = 0),

and the average single-repetition readout error rate is given by:
=

1
(1 + 0 )
2

(S32)

The value of  is plotted in Fig. S1 as a function of readout time in the absence and in
the presence of artificially added noise. We choose the value of tR that minimizes . The
histograms P (Ip |x0 = 1) and P (Ip |x0 = 0) and the error rates 1 and 0 corresponding to
that optimal value of tR are those used throughout the main text. In particular, they are
used to perform the Bayesian analysis detailed in Sec. II. Without adding artifical noise to
the readout traces, we find 1 = 32.9±0.5% and 0 = 16.2±0.4% at an optimal readout time
tR = 623 µs. After adding noise, we find 1 = 41.1±0.5% and 0 = 42.3±0.5% at an optimal
readout time tR = 475 µs. The error bars on 1 and 0 are given by the standard deviation
p
of the corresponding binomial error process with N = 104 samples, δ1 = 1 (1 − 1 )/N
p
and δ0 = 0 (1 − 0 )/N .

Note that we have assumed perfect preparation of the logical qubit state throughout.

For this device, preparation errors have been reported [14] to be ∼ 1%, smaller than the
single-repetition readout errors reported in Sec. III. In Sec. IV, we argue that the average
preparation error is in fact around 2 − 3% (4 − 5% for state |1i and < 1% for state |0i) for
this run of the experiment. Therefore, the empirically measured single-repetition readout
distributions in Figs. 3a-b are close to what they would be without preparation errors and

The optimal readout time in the absence (presence) of added noise is indicated by the dot-dashed
(dotted) line. In both cases, the shaded areas give the statistical uncertainty (see text). Finally,
we note that the small discontinuity in the blue curve at tR ≈ 1.7 ms is a consequence of the finite
histogram bin size and has no particular physical significance.

lead to decoding procedures (hard and soft) that are close to optimal. In Sec. IV, we give
rough estimates for the expected logical readout fidelity that would be measured in the
absence of preparation errors.

IV.

THEORETICAL SIMULATION

To explore the full potential of the repetitive readout discussed in the main text, we
perform a numerical simulation. For each qubit state, we randomly sample 104 outcome
sequences according to the hidden Markov model described in Sec. II. We use the experimentally extracted value of T1 and the empirically measured peak-signal distributions of
10

Fig. 3a as input parameters. A Monte-Carlo estimate of the average logical readout error
rate log is obtained by thresholding the simulated outcome sequences as described in Sec. III
and then applying the hard decoding procedure detailed in Sec. I.
log
The conditional logical readout error rates log
1 and 0 are plotted in Fig. S2 as a function

of the number of repetitions. The experimental results of Fig. 3c are shown for comparison.
It is clear from Fig. S2 that the simulated logical readout error rate underestimates the
experimentally measured readout error rate as the number of repetitions increases. We
believe that this is due to the logical readout error rate becoming comparable to preparation
errors for Q1. This assumption is consistent with the simulation and experiment agreeing at
low repetition number, where the logical readout error rate is much larger than the expected
preparation error (of the order of 1% [14]). In fact, it is possible to estimate the preparation
error η by fitting the simulated error rate sim to the experimentally measured error rate log
using the error composition relation
log = (1 − 2η)sim + η.

(S33)

We find that the simulation and experiment agree for a preparation error of η1 ≈ 4 − 5% for
state |1i and of η0 < 1% for state |0i, giving an average preparation error of approximately
η ≈ 2 − 3%. The simulation results suggest that in the absence of preparation errors, the
measured fidelity could reach ∼ 98% after 15 repetitions and saturate at > 99% for more
than 30 repetitions.

V.

ENGINEERING GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTIONS

It is known that if P (Ip |1) and P (Ip |0) are unimodal Gaussian distributions, soft decoding
can reduce the number of readout cycles by up to a factor of two for arbitrarily large readout
SNR. For this advantage to exist, the ‘bit-flip’ conversion errors creating the bimodal features
of the measured probability distributions must be small enough that the errors are dominated
by the Gaussian noise [15]. Understanding the origin of the conversion errors is thus of
great importance. Here, the ‘bit-flip’ conversion errors may arise from an imperfect CROT
gate, imperfect ancilla preparation, or imperfect spin-to-charge conversion in the readout of
Q2. The CROT and preparation errors will be generically suppressed as the control and
preparation fidelities are improved. The imperfect spin-to-charge conversion in the readout
11

FIG. S2. Simulated logical readout error rate (solid blue line) as a function of the number of
repetitions for (a) state |1i and (b) state |0i. In both cases, the experimentally measured logical
readout error rate is shown for comparison (dashed yellow line). The bands give the statistical error
associated with the binomial statistics of the sampled errors as explained in Sec. III. Moreover, the
dotted black curves give the simulated curves corrected to fit the experimental curves accounting
for finite preparation errors using Eq. (S33). The best fit values for the preparation errors are
η1 = 4% for state |1i and η0 = 0.44% for state |0i, resulting in an average preparation error of
η = 2.2%.

12

of Q2 may be the most challenging to overcome. In what follows, we discuss avenues to
suppress the spin-to-charge conversion errors.
For initialization of Q2 in state |1i, the dot should ideally remain empty at all times.
Thus, imperfect spin-to-charge conversion arises either from
1) the finite time scales for an electron to leave or re-enter the dot. The conversion errors
caused by these charge transitions could be suppressed by, e.g., engineering the density
of states [16] of the reservoir so that a spin-up electron tunnels out of the quantum
dot very rapidly, and so that a spin-down electron tunnels back in the quantum dot
very slowly [10]. If that were the case, the dot would remain empty at nearly all times
and the bimodality of P (Ip |1) would be suppressed.
2) spin relaxation of Q2 before the electron is able to leave the dot. Indeed, the spin
relaxation time of Q2 is of order 1 ms, which is only an order of magnitude longer
than the observed time scale ∼ 100 µs for an electron to escape to the reservoir. The
strategy to suppress spin relaxation of Q2 during readout depends strongly its physical
origin. However, there is a priori no fundamental reason why the spin relaxation time
of Q2 cannot be as large as that of Q1 (although it must be noted that increasing the
dot-reservoir coupling as suggested in point 1) may negatively affect the spin relaxation
time via cotunneling processes).
For initialization of Q2 in state |0i, the dot should ideally remain occupied at all times.
The probability of an electron leaving the dot should in principle be exponentially suppressed
in the ratio of the thermal energy to the Zeeman splitting. However, the observed probability
of transitioning to the reservoir is too large to be explained by such thermal suppression.
Instead, a measurement of the transition probability as a function of the plunger gate voltage
of Q2 suggests that the electron escapes the |0i state via an excited quantum dot state. The
value of the plunger voltage at which the transitions are suppressed is consistent with an
excited state with energy tens of µeVs above the ground state. We conjecture that this state
is an excited valley state with the same spin (spin-down) as the ground state. Therefore,
a likely explanation for the dominant transition mechanism is excitation to a higher valley
state (via, e.g., absorption of energy from the biased charge sensor) followed by a transition
from the excited valley state to the reservoir. The bimodality of P (Ip |0) could therefore be
suppressed by engineering valley splitting much larger than the charge sensor bias.
13

for optimization of qubit readout.
