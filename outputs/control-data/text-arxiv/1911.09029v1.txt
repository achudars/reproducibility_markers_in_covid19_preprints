Abstract: In this paper we present a detailed analysis of the Faraday depth (FD) spectrum and
its clean components obtained through the application of the commonly used technique of Faraday
rotation measure synthesis to analyze spectro-polarimetric data. In order to directly compare the
Faraday depth spectrum with physical properties of a magneto-ionic medium, we generated synthetic
broad-bandwidth spectro-polarimetric observations from magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of a
transonic, isothermal, compressible turbulent medium. We find that correlated magnetic field structures
give rise to a combination of spiky, localized peaks at certain FD values, and broad structures in the FD
spectrum. Although the majority of these spiky FD structures appear narrow, giving an impression of a
Faraday thin medium, we show that they arise from strong synchrotron emissivity at that FD. Strong
emissivity at a FD can arise because of both strong spatially-local polarized synchrotron emissivity at a
FD or accumulation of weaker emissions along the distance through a medium that have Faraday depths
within half the width of the rotation measure spread function. Such a complex Faraday depth spectrum is
a natural consequence of MHD turbulence when the lines of sight pass through a few turbulent cells. This
therefore complicates the convention of attributing narrow FD peaks to presence of a Faraday rotating
medium along the line of sight. Our work shows that it is difficult to extract the FD along a line of sight
from the Faraday depth spectrum using standard methods for a turbulent medium in which synchrotron
emission and Faraday rotation occur simultaneously.

1. Introduction
The advent of broad-band receivers on all major radio telescopes in the last decade have opened up
new avenues for investigating the properties of synchrotron-emitting relativistic plasma in astrophysical
objects. Previously, one had to observe the same source at multiple, widely-spaced frequencies to understand
its polarization behaviour. Broad-band radio spectro-polarimetric measurements of the Stokes Q and U
parameters makes it possible to measure the variation of the polarized synchrotron emission over a wide
contiguous frequency range which can provide crucial insights into the properties of the magneto-ionic

medium for a large number of sources in a much reduced amount of observing time. Broad-band
spectro-polarimetry has played a crucial role in unveiling the properties of magnetic fields in nearby
galaxies [1–3], in high redshift galaxies [4,5], in active galactic nuclei [AGN; 6–8] and the intergalactic
medium [9]. In order to physically interpret such data, the technique of Faraday rotation measure (RM)
synthesis [10,11] and direct fitting of the Stokes Q and U spectra of a polarized source with models of
the magneto-ionic media, known as Stokes Q, U fitting [6,12,13] have been developed. It is often not
straightforward to interpret the results from these techniques and connect them to the physical properties
of the magnetized plasmas being investigated [14].
Currently, several large-scale spectro-polarimetric campaigns are underway, mostly in the 1 to 5 GHz
frequency range. On one hand, dedicated surveys with interferometers are being conducted to study the
broad-band polarization properties of millions of extragalactic sources. For example, the Karl G. Jansky
Very Large Array Sky Survey [VLASS; 15,16], the Polarization Sky Survey of the Universe’s Magnetism
[POSSUM; 17], the QU Observations at Cm wavelength with Km baselines using ATCA1 (QUOCKA),
the MeerKAT International GHz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration (MIGHTEE) Survey [18], and the
recent LOFAR Two-meter Sky Survey [LoTSS; 19,20] and S-PASS/ATCA [21]. Many more broad-band
polarization surveys are planned in the future with the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA).
On the other hand, to study the diffuse Galactic magneto-ionic medium, broad-band, large sky-area
surveys below ∼ 15 GHz with single dish telescopes have been undertaken, e.g., the Global Magneto-Ionic
Medium Survey [GMIMS; 22], the GALFA Continuum Transit Survey [GALFACTS; 23], the S-band
Polarization All Sky Survey [S-PASS; 24], survey with the SKA-MPG prototype telescope [25], the C-Band
All Sky Survey [C-BASS; 26] and the Q-U-I JOint TEnerife [QUIJOTE; 27,28].
With these broad-band polarization surveys, pressing astrophysical problems, such as, black hole
accretion and its connection to AGN jet launching mechanism, cosmic evolution of magnetic fields in
galaxies, structure and strength of magnetic fields in the interstellar, intra-cluster and intergalactic medium
will be investigated [see e.g. 29]. In addition to addressing astrophysical questions, these surveys will also
contribute to the solution of fundamental cosmological questions via sensitive measurements of the Galactic
diffuse synchrotron emission. This emission contaminates cosmological signals from the early Universe,
such as, the cosmic microwave background radiation, the cosmic dawn and the epoch of reionization.
Quantities related to the plasma properties of a magneto-ionic medium that can be derived from
observations are: the intrinsic fractional polarization and angle of the linearly polarized synchrotron
emission, the Faraday depth (FD) and its dispersion. The intrinsic fractional polarization is determined by
the ratio of turbulent to ordered magnetic field strengths in the plane of the sky averaged over the telescope
beam [30]. The intrinsic angle of the linearly polarized emission gives us information about the orientation
of the ordered magnetic fields in the plane of the sky. The Faraday depth gives us information on the
strength and direction of the average magnetic field parallel to the line of sight and its spatial variation can
help us to distinguish between coherent and anisotropic random magnetic fields [31]. The dispersion of
FD depends upon the properties of turbulent magnetic fields parallel to the line of sight. Hence, robust
measurements of these quantities can provide insights into the 3-dimensional properties of magneto-ionic
media in astrophysical sources. To measure them, RM synthesis and Stokes Q, U fitting techniques are
applied to broad-band spectro-polarimetric observations. Therefore, it is imperative to investigate, in detail,
the scope of application of these data analysis techniques and their limitations. Understanding the efficacy
and efficiency of these tools are of paramount importance for the success of the above mentioned surveys.

In this paper we will focus on the technique of RM synthesis when it is applied to infer properties of
diffuse medium, e.g., the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM). Starting with magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
simulations of isothermal, transonic, compressible turbulent plasma, similar to that observed in the Galactic
ISM [32,33], we use ray-tracing to simulate broad-band spectro-polarimetric observations. Then, we apply
RM synthesis to test what we can learn about the medium. The major questions we will investigate are:
(1) Is there a difference in the nature of the Faraday depth spectrum obtained by applying RM synthesis to
a medium with a realistic model of turbulence from MHD simulations versus the commonly used model
of turbulence as a Gaussian random field? (2) What is the origin of complexity in the Faraday depth
spectrum? (3) Can RM synthesis recover the Faraday depth of a diffuse medium which is simultaneously
Faraday rotating and emitting polarized synchrotron radiation?
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we discuss in brief the techniques of RM synthesis and
Stokes Q, U fitting. We present in brief the salient features of the software package, COSMIC, for generating
synthetic broad-band spectro-polarimetric data from MHD simulations in Section 3. In Section 4 we test the
numerical performance of COSMIC using simulated media for which the broad-band polarization behaviour
is known analytically. We present details of the MHD simulations in Section 5 and synthetic polarization
observations performed by applying COSMIC to the simulations are discussed in Section 6. In Section 7 we
present a detailed analysis of the results obtained from RM synthesis and compare them to the intrinsic
properties of the medium, and we summarize our findings in Section 8.
2. Common spectro-polarimetric data analysis techniques
RM synthesis and Stokes Q, U fitting are two commonly used techniques that are used to extract
information from broad-band observations of polarized emission. The parameters of interest are the intrinsic
fractional polarization (pint ), intrinsic orientation of the polarization angle (θ0 ), Faraday depth (FD) and
the intrinsic dispersion of FD (σFD ). In order to gain physical insights into an astrophysical system, robust
measurement of these quantities are essential.
• Stokes parameter (Q, U ) fitting: The technique of Stokes Q, U fitting is a parametric fitting of the
Stokes Q and U parameters’ wavelength (λ) dependent variation using models of a turbulent magneto-ionic
media analytically derived, for example, in Burn [10], Tribble [34], Sokoloff et al. [30] and Rossetti et al.
[35], and therefore requires assumptions on the nature of the medium being investigated. In Stokes Q, U
fitting, pint , θ0 , FD and σFD are directly fitted for as model parameters. However, fitting is limited to a
set of source models that might oversimplify the physics inside real radio sources and their environments.
Moreover, often the broad-band Stokes Q and U data cannot be fitted by a single model and therefore
linear combinations of models are used. Since increasing the number of models improves the quality of
the fit by increasing the number of free parameters [principle of parsimony; 36], statistical measures, such
as, the Bayesian inference criterion and/or Akaike information criterion are used to limit the number of
models or to choose between degenerate fits [6,37]. However, Stokes Q, U fitting has the advantage of also
fitting for the spectral index of the polarized flux density [see 37], which is not possible in RM synthesis
and is one of the origins of complexity in the Faraday depth spectrum [e.g., 21,37].
• Rotation measure synthesis: RM synthesis is a Fourier transform-like operation in which it is
assumed that the linearly polarized radio source can be described as a sum of emitters at their respective
Faraday depths, and is the Fourier transform of the frequency spectrum of the complex polarization2 [10,11].
Therefore, RM synthesis makes only a weak assumption about the physical properties of the magneto-ionic
medium and is a non-parametric approach. Like any Fourier transform performed over a finite space (in

this case a finite frequency coverage), the Faraday depth spectrum (variation of fractional polarization p or
polarized intensity P I as a function of FD) obtained from RM synthesis is convolved with a complicated
response function determined by the frequency coverage of the observations. The response function is
known as the rotation measure spread function (RMSF) and has sidelobes due to sharp cut-offs and gaps
in the frequency coverage. Artefacts produced by the RMSF sidelobes can be deconvolved by applying
the technique of RM clean [38]. In the case when Faraday rotation originates at multiple Faraday depths
or Faraday depth varies contiguously through a volume, RM clean models a source as discrete δ-function
emitters in Faraday depth space known as clean components. The full-width at half-maximum (FWHM)
of the RMSF is determined by the bandwidth in λ2 of the observations and it determines how well the
emitters can be resolved in the Faraday depth space. The channel width of observations determines the
maximum observable FD and the highest frequency end determines the sensitivity to the largest scale
structure in the Faraday depth space [see 11, for details]. This means that the results depend heavily on the
frequency coverage used, and interpreting the RM cleaned Faraday depth spectra or the clean components
can be a challenging task.
Another challenge of RM synthesis is the way pint , θ0 , FD and σFD are determined from the Faraday
depth spectrum. This comes down to a matter of choice for an individual investigator. In order to
extract information on the physical quantities of magneto-ionic media, attempts have recently been made
to describe the Faraday depth spectrum using parametric functions. In such an approach, the Faraday
depth spectrum is modelled as a δ-function for a purely Faraday rotating medium, as a top-hat function
for a simultaneously Faraday rotating and synchrotron emitting medium containing regular magnetic
fields and constant densities of thermal and relativistic electrons, and as super-Gaussian function for a
medium which contains both turbulent and regular magnetic fields [14,39,40]. Recently, Van Eck [41]
proposed a model-free description of mapping the Faraday depth spectrum to polarized emission as a
function of distance. The parametric descriptions, for both Faraday depth spectra and Stokes Q, U fitting,
implicitly assume a Gaussian random distribution of the components of the turbulent magnetic field. In
contrast, the turbulent magnetic field and free electron distribution in the diffuse ISM, the focus of this
paper, are expected to have spatially correlated structures, and are often non-Gaussian [42–46]. Further,
observations of extragalactic sources and the diffuse Galactic emission have revealed that FD spectra often
show complicated structures [14,47,48] referred to as Faraday complexity. A part of the complexity can be
introduced by the spectral index of the polarized emission, and hence RM synthesis is typically performed
on fractional polarized parameters. Dedicated efforts, both mathematical and computational, are required
to incorporate information on spectral index and Faraday depolarization into RM synthesis.
Because of these caveats, it is necessary to investigate the results of RM synthesis using MHD
turbulence simulations which provide a more realistic magnetic field and Faraday depth distribution that
are not described by simple Gaussian statistics.
3. COSMIC: from physical quantities to Stokes parameters and Faraday rotation
We have developed an end-to-end, fully parallelized, Python based software package — Computerized
Observations of Simulated MHD Inferred Cubes (COSMIC) — to generate synthetic data cubes of Stokes
parameters as a function of frequency for further analysis. RM synthesis and RM clean are performed
by integrating the pyrmsynth package3 into COSMIC. The code requires 3-dimensional (3-D) spatial cubes
of the three magnetic field components (in units of µG) and the distribution of neutral or ionized gas
density (in units of cm−3 ) computed from MHD simulations as inputs, in a Cartesian coordinate system.

Depending on the type of MHD simulations, other optional inputs can be provided, such as, the 3-D spatial
distributions of temperature and the number density or energy spectrum of cosmic ray electrons (CREs).
The default coordinate system is chosen such that the line of sight (LOS) is along the z-axis and, x- and
y-axes are in the plane of the sky. However, COSMIC allows the user to choose the LOS axis perpendicular
to any of the six faces of the cube.
For MHD simulations which do not contain cosmic rays, to compute the total synchrotron emission
and the Stokes Q and U parameters of the linearly polarized synchrotron emission, a user can choose from
several options to determine the number density of CREs (nCRE ) and their energy spectrum. Similarly, to
compute the Faraday depth, the number density of free electrons (ne ) is estimated by choosing a suitable
ionization model depending on the type of the simulations and other ancillary data computed in the
simulations, such as, the gas temperature. Using these, COSMIC computes the 2-D distribution of the total
synchrotron intensity and the Stokes Q and U parameters on the plane of the sky across a frequency range
specified by the user. Details of how observables are computed numerically and the different user-specified
options are presented in Appendix A.
4. Benchmarking COSMIC with analytic models of magneto-ionic media
To test the accuracy of the numerical calculations performed by COSMIC, we first compared outputs
from it with simple models of magneto-ionic media whose frequency-dependent polarization behaviour have
analytic solutions. We simulated two types of radio sources which are simultaneously synchrotron emitting
and Faraday rotating: (1) a uniform slab containing a regular magnetic field and constant densities of free
electrons and CREs [10,30]; (2) a volume that contains both regular and turbulent magnetic fields in which
the turbulent fields have a Gaussian random distribution, known as the internal Faraday dispersion (IFD)
model [30].
4.1. Uniform slab model
A uniform slab, also commonly referred to as a ‘Burn slab’ after Burn [10], is a synchrotron emitting
medium in which the strengths of the three magnetic field components and the densities of CRE and
thermal electrons are all spatially constant. We generated such a medium on a 512 × 512 × 512 pixel3 mesh
and assumed the mesh points to be separated by 1 pc. Therefore, the physical volume of the simulated
uniform medium is 512 × 512 × 512 pc3 . The values of the physical quantities used to simulate a uniform
slab are listed in Table 1. We have used CRE density such that the total synchrotron flux density of the

medium is 10 Jy at 1 GHz (see Section A.1). We assumed a power-law energy spectrum of the CREs, so
that, the synchrotron emission also follow a power-law frequency spectrum with spectral index α = −0.8
(Iν ∝ ν α , where Iν is the intensity at frequency ν).

Here, pint is the intrinsic fractional polarization of the medium, after accounting for any
frequency-independent beam depolarization of the synchrotron emission that might be present, for example
due to unresolved turbulent magnetic fields. As there is no beam or random magnetic field in this model,
pint is the same as the maximum fractional polarization pmax given in Eq. (A5). The expected values of
pint , FD and θ0 are listed in Table 2.

numerical calculations, the parameters of the analytical model, namely, pint , FD and θ0 , were calculated
directly from the COSMIC output. Note that the fractional polarization and the angle of polarization are
given by the amplitude and phase of the complex polarization, and are dependent on the wavelength (e.g.,
Eq. 1). Therefore, pint and θ0 can either be determined at λ = 0, which is unphysical, or when FD and/or
σFD are 0 rad m−2 . We therefore computed pint and θ0 by setting FD in each pixel of the 3-D cube to zero
and then performing the synthetic observations. In Table 2, we present the expected values of pint , FD and
θ0 , and compare them with those computed from the cubes. All the values are in excellent agreement with
the theoretical values.
4.2. Internal dispersion model
The internal Faraday dispersion (IFD) model describes a medium that is simultaneously synchrotron
emitting and Faraday rotating in the presence of both regular and random magnetic fields, wherein the
random field is isotropic, has Gaussian statistics and is delta-correlated (i.e. there are no correlated
structures in the field). In other words, the correlation length is same as the length of the mesh point
separation. We generated a volume of the same dimension as in Section 4.1, but in this case, the magnetic
field strengths of each component in each 1 pc3 pixel were drawn at random from a Gaussian distribution.
The mean value of the Gaussian represents the regular field strength along the corresponding direction
and the standard deviation is a measure of the strength of the turbulent fields. Values of the different
parameters used to generate the IFD volume are listed in Table 1.
The complex fractional polarization in such a medium varies with λ as [30],

delta-correlated.

Figure 2. Synthetic spectra of Stokes parameters of synchrotron emission generated by COSMIC for an internal
Faraday dispersion model. Different shades of data points in the inset of the top right panel show the fractional
polarization computed by averaging over different areas. All other panels, data points and lines have the same
meaning as in Fig. 1. In the main plots only the results for averaging over 50 × 50 pixel2 are shown.

For our choice of parameters in Table 1, pint , θ0 , FD and σFD are theoretically expected to be 0.176,
150.26◦ , 103.94 rad m−2 and 9.2 rad m−2 , respectively. In Table 2, we compare these values with those
directly obtained from COSMIC output using the same method as described at the end of the previous
section. The values agree well with each other. In Fig. 2, we show the variation of polarization fraction
with λ computed from synthetic observations of the simulated volume and they agree well with the analytic
function given in Eq. (2).
We should point out that, in this case, we determined the frequency spectra of the polarization
parameters shown in Fig. 2 by averaging over 50 × 50 pixels2 in the I, Q and U images. This is done to
ensure that there are a sufficient number of pixels to capture the Gaussian statistics generated by standard
routines for generating random numbers in Python. For smaller averaging areas, significant deviations of the
synthetic data from the analytic function is observed, especially towards longer wavelengths. A comparison
of the variation of fractional polarization with λ2 obtained from synthetic observations by averaging over
different areas is shown in the inset of the top right-hand panel of Fig. 2. At shorter wavelengths, all
synthetic observations agrees well with the analytic function.
5. Applying COSMIC to MHD simulations of a turbulent medium
The magnetic fields and free electrons in the ISM have more complicated distributions than can be
described by simple delta-correlated Gaussian statistics, for example they can have spatial correlations
in their structure [see e.g., 1,44,46]. Therefore, investigating the broad-band properties of the linearly

Version November 21, 2019 accepted in Galaxies

polarized synchrotron emission from realistic MHD simulations is required, especially with several on-going
and upcoming polarization surveys of the Milky Way’s diffuse emission.
Here we apply COSMIC to MHD simulations of isothermal, compressible and transonic turbulence in
the ISM from Burkhart et al. [43,50]. Polarization observations of the Galactic plane and Galactic Hi
21 cm observations of the warm gas have confirmed the transonic nature of turbulence in the ISM [32,33,51].
The simulation set up is similar to that of past works [43,52,53]. We refer to these works for the details
of the numerical set-up and we only provide a short overview here. The simulation used here is a 3-D
turbulent box of isothermal compressible MHD turbulence with a resolution 5123 , and each mesh point
is separated by 1 pc. The code is a third-order accurate essentially nonoscillatory scheme which solves
the ideal MHD equations in a periodic box with purely solenoidal driving of the flow at a scale 2.5 times
smaller than the domain size, i.e., ∼ 200 pc. The simulation has two control parameters: the sonic Mach
number (Ms = v/cs , where v is the flow velocity and cs is the sound speed) and Alfvénic Mach number
(MA = v/vA , where vA is the Alfvén speed). In these simulations, we used Ms ≈ 2.0 and MA ≈ 0.7. The
magnetic field consists of a regular background field (Bext ) and a turbulent field (b), i.e., B = Bext + b
with the magnetic field initialized along a single preferred direction. In the choice of our coordinate system,
the regular field is along the x-direction and has a strength of 10 µG. This regular field will not contribute
to Faraday depth as the LOS is along the z-direction.
The distribution of the strengths of the three magnetic field components over the entire simulation
volume is shown in Fig. 3. The corresponding dashed lines are for equivalent Gaussian distributions computed
from the mean and standard deviation of the corresponding field component. The distribution of Bx shows
deviation from a Gaussian distribution, while that for By and Bz agrees well with Gaussian distributions.
We must stress, although the distributions of the magnetic field components closely resembles a Gaussian
distribution, spatially they are correlated on the driving scale of turbulence in these simulations, unlike the
delta-correlated Gaussian fields described in Section 4.2. For details regarding their structural and statistical
properties we refer interested readers to Burkhart et al. [43,50]. To summarize, physical specifications of
the simulations are as follows: (1) Physical size of the simulation volume is 512 × 512 × 512 pc3 . (2) Mesh
resolution of the simulation is 1 × 1 × 1 pc3 . (3) The mean magnetic field strengths are: hBx i = 10 µG and
hBy i = hBz i ≈ 0 µG; and the three components have dispersions σx = 2 µG, σy = 3 µG and σz = 3 µG.
Thus, the ratio of regular to turbulent field strengths in this simulation is ∼ 2. We would like to emphasize
that this regular field, local to the simulated volume, would only contribute to the polarized intensity
of the synthetic observations, unlike those observed in external galaxies. Polarization measurements in
external galaxies are performed with comparatively lower spatial resolution. Therefore, they are are mostly
sensitive to the ordered component of the magnetic field within the beam, or to the large-scale regular
fields, and therefore in external galaxies, the ordered fields are found to be about three times weaker than
the turbulent fields [54].
As the MHD simulation used in this work is isothermal and in thermal equilibrium, the ionization
fraction, fion , of neutral hydrogen is assumed to be constant throughout the volume and can be chosen
to compute the free electron density ne (see Appendix A.2). Increasing fion increases ne and thereby the
amount of Faraday rotation (FDcell ) in each cell of the MHD cube, which increases the amount of Faraday
depolarization through the entire LOS. To find physically motivated value for fion , we produced maps of

emission measure (EM = n2e dl) and dispersion measure (DM = ne dl) for various values of fion and
compared EM vs. DM by averaging over different areas [55]. In the left-hand panel of Fig. 4 we show the
variation of EM as a function of DM. The slope of the best-fit line (shown as the black line) is found to
be 2.4 ± 0.1 indicating that the simulation used here is strongly clumpy with low fV . We varied fion such
that the amplitude roughly matches with observations of the Galactic ISM. For example, Berkhuijsen and
Müller [56] found a slope of 1.15 for the EM vs. DM relation for the diffuse ionized gas around the Solar

neighbourhood with mean fV = 0.08. In denser and clumpier ISM with fV < 0.06, the slope of the EM vs.
DM relation was estimated to be 2 by Pynzar’ [57].
For the simulations used here, the amplitude of the EM vs. DM relation agrees well with that observed
in our Galaxy for fion = 0.5 (see Fig. 4). In the right-hand panel of Fig. 4, we show the distribution of ne
in the simulation volume for fion = 0.5. Here, the median ne is 0.11 cm−3 and it has a maximum value of
3.5 cm−3 . Such values of ne are typically observed within Galactic latitudes ±15◦ [57,58]. The distribution
of ne is well approximated by a Gamma distribution (solid black line) with shape parameter ≈ 2.25 and
inverse scale parameter ≈ 0.06, i.e., an expectation value for ne ≈ 0.13 cm−3 .
For the values of ne and Bk in these MHD simulations, < 0.3% of the 1 pc3 mesh points have
|FDcell | > 3 rad m−2 and < 1% mesh points have |FDcell | > 2 rad m−2 . That means, within the cell,
< 0.3% and < 1% of the mesh points undergo Faraday depolarization of > 20% and > 10%, respectively,
at frequencies below ∼ 0.5 GHz. Calculations of the polarization parameters in COSMIC assumes that the
Faraday depolarization in a single mesh point is negligible (see Appendices A.2, A.3 and A.4). Therefore,
for these simulations COSMIC can be safely applied to frequencies above 0.5 GHz.
The following options were used to compute the synthetic spectra of Isync , P I, Stokes Q and U in the
rest of this paper. (1) As the simulations do not contain cosmic rays and the typical CRE propagation
lengths are expected to be comparable to or larger than the size of the simulation box (see Appendix A.1),
we assume that the CREs are uniformly distributed throughout the 3-D volume of the simulation. (2) The
CREs follow a power-law energy spectra with the same energy index throughout the volume. Thus, the
synchrotron intensity spectral index (α) is constant, both spatially and with frequency, with α = −0.8
defined as Isync ∝ ν α . (3) nCRE is normalized such that the total synchrotron flux density at 1 GHz
integrated over the entire volume is 10 Jy (see Appendix A.1). Note that the amplitude of the frequency
spectrum of intrinsic emissivities of the total synchrotron emission, and Stokes Q and U parameters can
be scaled depending on the unknown nCRE without affecting the relative frequency variation. (4) The
ionization fraction is constant throughout the volume with fion = 0.5.
In the following analyses, we have not added any systematic effects arising from combining data
observed using multiple telescope receivers into one large bandwidth or telescope noise. Also, the synthetic
observations are not sampled using u − v coverage of an interferometer and therefore mimicks observations

about a medium from RM synthesis under ideal conditions.
6. Synthetic observations of MHD simulations
We compute synthetic spectra of the total and linearly polarized quantities that describe the synchrotron
emission of the volume in the frequency range 0.5 to 6 GHz divided into 500 frequency channels. The
choice of lowest frequency is determined by the need to minimize Faraday depolarization within each 3-D
mesh point (see Section 5) and the highest frequency is chosen such that the synthetic observations are
sensitive to broad structures in the Faraday depth space and roughly corresponds to the high frequency
end of on-going spectro-polarimetric surveys of the diffuse Galactic synchrotron emission [e.g. 26].
In the left-hand panel of Fig. 5, we show the 3-D total synchrotron emissivity of the simulated volume
at 1 GHz. The right-hand panel shows the projected 2-D map of the total synchrotron intensity (Isync )
obtained by integrating the 3-D cube in the left-hand panel along the z-axis, our LOS axis. Since we
have assumed a constant density of CREs, all of the structure in this image arises due to the variations of
synchrotron emissivity caused by fluctuations of the magnetic field component in the plane of the sky, both
along and across the LOS.
In Fig. 6, we show the polarized intensities at 0.5, 1.5 and 5 GHz. Due to frequency dependent Faraday
depolarization, the polarized emission develops small-scale structures at lower frequencies. This is due to
fluctuations in Bk along and across the lines of sight. For frequencies below ∼ 3 GHz, where most of the
polarized surveys of Galactic diffuse emission have been performed [e.g., 48,59–61], the polarized emission
shows some ‘canal-like’ small scale structures [e.g. 62]. Due to severe Faraday depolarization at 0.5 GHz, the
polarized emission show structures on scales of a few pixels. The maps of Stokes Q and U parameters also
show a similar trend in their structural properties with frequency. This underlines the challenge of combining
interferometric observations of diffuse emission at different frequencies. The smooth, diffuse structure in
Stokes Q and U at the highest frequencies will be filtered out from the data. This does not happen at lower
frequencies because different sightlines undergo different amounts of Faraday depolarization, leading to

rapid variations on small scales. This issue cannot be overcome even if frequency-scaled interferometer
arrays are used to match the u − v coverage at different frequencies.
6.1. Broad-band spectra of Stokes parameters
Fig. 7 shows the synthetic spectra of the total synchrotron emission and parameters of linearly polarized
synchrotron emission between 0.5 and 6 GHz. All the quantities are computed by averaging over a randomly
chosen 30 × 30 pixel2 region corresponding to a spatial scale of 30 × 30 pc2 . The polarized emission at lower
frequencies (< 1 GHz) show strong frequency-dependent variations. This implies that at low frequencies,
the small-scale polarized structures seen in the left-hand panel of Fig. 7 are also expected to vary strongly
with slight changes in frequency.
Although Stokes Q, U fitting is not the main focus of this work, we none-the-less present in brief the
result of fitting the synthetic data shown in Fig. 7. Stokes Q, U fitting was performed using analytical
functions for several types of depolarization models described in Sokoloff et al. [30] and O’Sullivan et al. [7]
and their linear combinations. In our Stokes Q, U fitting routine, we allow combination of a maximum
of three depolarization models and use the corrected Akaike information criteria [63,64] to choose the
best-fit model. Because of the strong variation of the Stokes Q and U parameters in the longer wavelength
regime (in this case roughly > 700 cm2 corresponding to frequencies < 1.1 GHz), the combination of
three depolarization models is not sufficient to fit the Stokes Q and U parameter spectra for the entire

wavelength range considered here. However, for wavelengths below 700 cm2 , fits converged successfully
(inset in Fig. 7). For the synthetic data in Fig. 7, the best-fit was obtained with a linear combination of
three internal Faraday depolarization components (Eq. 2). In fact, none of the regions we have investigated
in these simulations could be fitted by a single depolarization model, in contrast to the simulated volumes
in Section 4. This implies that spatially correlated distributions of the magnetic fields and/or thermal
electron densities, as in these MHD simulations, could possibly give rise to multiple polarized components
(also see Section 7.2) that have different wavelength-dependent depolarization behaviours.
The failure of Stokes Q, U fitting in being able to fit the synthetic data below ∼ 1 GHz with three or
less components brings to light an important aspect about the technique. To our knowledge, most of the
Stokes Q, U fitting in the literature has been applied to data above ∼ 1 GHz, or to high redshift sources for
which the rest-frame emission originated close to 1 GHz or higher, and up to three polarization components
has been sufficient to fit those data. It will be interesting to investigate the performance of Stokes Q, U
fitting when broad-band spectro-polarimetric data is acquired below 1 GHz for a large number of sources
with future surveys. A detailed investigation of the results of Stokes Q, U fitting, the generic properties of
the method in connection to different types of MHD simulations and the optimum number of depolarization

models required to extract maximum physical insights into a diffuse magneto-ionic medium is beyond the
scope of this paper, and will be discussed elsewhere.
6.2. Reconstructed Faraday depth map
To construct the Faraday depth map from the synthetic Stokes Q and U parameters, we applied
the technique of RM synthesis. In order to avoid complications arising from the effects of spectral index
[21,37], all analysis pertaining to RM synthesis were performed on fractional polarization quantities, i.e.,
q = Q/Isync , u = U /Isync and p = P I/Isync . For the frequency setup used here, the RMSF has a FWHM
of 10 rad m−2 and is sensitive to extended Faraday depth structures up to ∼ 1250 rad m−2 [see 11]. This is
sufficient to perform high Faraday depth resolution investigation of these synthetic observations without
being affected by missing large-scale Faraday depth structures.
The Faraday depth spectrum was computed for the search range −3000 to +3000 rad m−2 with
a step size of 0.5 rad m−2 . Since we have not added any noise to the synthetic data, RM clean was
performed by setting loop gain to 0.02 and with 1000 cleaning iterations. This allows cleaning down to the
minimum fractional emissivity of the 3-D mesh points in the simulated volume. Synthetic observations
are processed using the pyrmsynth implementation of RM synthesis to produce a Faraday depth spectrum
which is then deconvolved using RM clean. In Fig. 8, we show the expected Faraday depth map from the
R
MHD simulations (FDMHD = 0.812 ne Bk dl, computed using Eq. (A4)) on the left-hand side and the
reconstructed Faraday depth map computed using RM synthesis (FDRM synthesis ) on the right-hand side.
We have determined FDRM synthesis in a pixel as the location of the peak of the Faraday depth spectrum
computed by fitting a parabola. The spatial features in the reconstructed FD map broadly matches with
the FDMHD map, but the magnitudes differ significantly. Also, some regions of the reconstructed FD map
show sharp jumps across neighbouring pixels. In the next section we will discuss in detail the complexity of
determining the Faraday depth from the Faraday depth spectrum.
In the left-hand panel of Fig. 9, we show the distribution of the difference FDRM synthesis − FDMHD .
The FWHM of the RMSF for the synthetic observations of only 10 rad m−2 , which in combination with
the signal-to-noise ratio, gives an estimate of the error of determined FD. Since, we have not added any
noise to the synthetic data, the estimated FDRM synthesis is expected to have vanishing error. However,
FDRM synthesis is significantly off with respect to the expected FDMHD by up to ±200 rad m−2 . This is

mainly because of the way FD is determined from Faraday depth spectra that are highly complex as
discussed in the next section. To assess possible systematic effects arising from the RMSF and/or sensitivity
to large Faraday depth structures, we also computed FDRM synthesis for different frequency coverages. The
different histograms in Fig. 9 (left-hand panel) show the distribution of FDRM synthesis − FDMHD for the
different frequency coverages. The respective RMSFs are shown in the right-hand panel of Fig. 9. For none
of the frequency ranges is FD recovered with sufficient accuracy.
7. Comparing Faraday depth spectrum obtained by RM synthesis with the intrinsic
spectrum of a turbulent medium
In this section we examine Faraday depth spectrum of individual lines of sight through both the
simple benchmark data cubes of Section 4 and the MHD turbulence data cube described in Section 5,
using two different methods. First, the COSMIC code is used to generate Stokes Q and U values using the
observational setup described in Section 6 and Faraday depth spectra were computed in the same way
described in Section 6.2. Second, we calculate the polarized emissivity and the local Faraday depth at each
position along the same lines of sight to generate a model of the intrinsic Faraday depth spectrum for that
LOS.
We wish to know how close the two Faraday depth spectra are for a realistic model of a turbulent,
synchrotron emitting medium. In particular, does a spectrum obtained by RM synthesis give a true
representation of the emissivity distribution by Faraday depth that the medium actually produces? If the
answer to this is no, then what is the connection between the Faraday depth spectrum and the physical
state of the emitting region? Whilst the answers to these questions will probably not be surprising, with
hindsight, to someone familiar with the method, we will gain valuable insights into the nature of the
problem from this investigation.
7.1. Faraday depth spectra of analytical models
We first illustrate the process using the two simple models for the distribution of emissivity and Faraday
depth described in Section 4: a uniform slab and a internal Faraday dispersion volume with delta-correlated
Gaussian random fields. Artefacts introduced by the RM synthesis and RM clean algorithms will be clearly
visible, the data will provide a useful reference point for comparisons later, and we shall begin to see the
difficulties in discriminating between very different sources using the technique.

Figure 10. Faraday depth spectra for the uniform slab (left) and internal Faraday dispersion (IFD) models (right).
The red lines are the clean components. The blue dots shows the relative intrinsic synchrotron emissivities at
respective FD computed from the simulated volume described in Section 4 and represents a model of the intrinsic
Faraday depth spectrum. For the IFD model, we have averaged 10 × 10 pixel2 pixels.

In Fig. 10, for both the uniform slab and Gaussian random field models, we show three different
versions of the Faraday depth spectra along a single LOS: the continuous lines show the RM cleaned Faraday
depth spectrum; the vertical red lines show the position and amplitude of individual clean components
in this spectrum selected by the RM clean algorithm; the blue dots show the polarized emission at each
Faraday depth computed directly from the simulations and serves as a model Faraday depth spectrum. At
λ = 0, the last representation is equivalent to equation 2 in Van Eck [41].
For the uniform slab (Fig. 10, left-hand panel), the Faraday depth spectrum for a single LOS shows
the double-horn feature that arises due to sharp edges in the magnetic field distribution and finite frequency
coverage for performing RM synthesis [see e.g., 65–67, for detailed discussions]. One of the peaks is close to
0 rad m−2 , while the other peak is located at 102.1 rad m−2 , consistent with the Faraday depth through the
entire layer of 103.94 rad m−2 . The Faraday depth spectrum for the IFD model (Fig. 10, right-hand panel)
also shows peaks in the spectrum from the front of the layer at 0 rad m−2 and the rear at 100 rad m−2 ,
but three additional maxima are detected by RM synthesis. It is worth noting that all 512 mesh points
along this LOS have a random magnetic field component which is not correlated with the magnetic field of
its neighbours (the random field is said to be delta-correlated). These random fluctuations will produce
point-to-point, uncorrelated, variation in both the polarized emissivity and the local Faraday depth, as
seen for the blue points in Fig. 10 (right-hand panel). The reason why there are a few, not 512 peaks, in
the spectrum is because these local variations are blended together by both the resolution of the RMSF
(see right-hand panel of Fig. 9) and because emission from different positions along the LOS may occur
at the same Faraday depth. In principle, the former effect can be removed by deconvolution using RM
clean but the latter effect is irreversible. It is important to note, a single LOS through an IFD medium
does not contain sufficient statistical information on the delta-correlated random fields, therefore in Fig. 10
(right-hand panel) we have averaged over 10 × 10 pixel2 . For a comparison with single LOS results presented
later as closely as possible, we have chosen averaging over 10 × 10 pixel2 instead of larger area as was done
in Section 4.

The blue points in Fig. 10 show the intrinsic Faraday depth spectra of the models, which should be
compared to the red bars showing the components selected by RM clean. The only noticeable difference
between the distribution of clean components, which are roughly constant in each model, is the lower
amplitudes for the random field model which is a consequence of lower intrinsic fractional polarization
(Eq. 4). The Faraday depth spectra allow for an easy identification of the uniform slab, but the clean
components do not. In both models the amplitudes of the clean components appear to be systematically
lower than the intrinsic emissivities because of normalization: the peak intrinsic emissivity is scaled to be
the same magnitude as the peak clean component, as described in Section 7.3.
7.2. The origin of complexity in the Faraday depth spectrum of a turbulent medium
Here, we look into the Faraday depth spectrum obtained by performing RM synthesis on the synthetic
observations of MHD turbulence simulations and compare them to features in the variations of synchrotron
emissivity and Faraday depth along the LOS. We will discuss based on three LOS shown in Fig. 11, as they
are sufficiently representative of any other LOS and are therefore general representation of the results we

linearly polarized synchrotron emissivity, at each position along the LOS and also the Faraday depth from
that position to the front of the domain (the side nearest to the notional observer). The emissivity-proxy
(1.8)/2
fluctuates randomly about the expected mean value of hB⊥ i(1−α) = (hBx i2 + hBy i2 )
≈ (10 µG)1.8
(see Section 5), due to variation in Bx , By . This will translate into random structure in the amplitude of
(1−α)

the Faraday depth spectrum. In Fig. 11 (left column), B⊥
is colourized based on the intrinsic angle of
polarization. Because of the strong Bext along the x-direction, the polarization angle do not show strong
fluctuations.
The Faraday depth of each point along the LOS shows a systematic non-random variation with position.
This is because the Faraday depth is cumulative from a given position to the observer and the fluctuations
in the magnetic field components are not delta-correlated. The correlation scale of Lc ∼ 200 pc is controlled
by the forcing used to drive turbulence in the simulation: in these simulations the forcing scale is about
2.5 times smaller than the simulation box [43]. The driven turbulence contains fluctuations on all scales
from Lc down to the dissipation scale (the separation between mesh points in this case), but the power-law
behaviour of the magnetic energy means that the field is strongest at Lc . So, the Faraday depth builds up
systematically over path lengths of roughly 200 pc. An interesting consequence of this is that, because the
domain size is 512 pc, the Faraday depth variation along the LOS is not necessarily a monotonic function:
the maximum magnitude of Faraday depth along a given LOS may not be that from the back to the front
of the domain. If the domain was half the size, the Faraday depth variation would tend to be monotonic
and if it were much bigger we would see multiple peaks and troughs in the Faraday depth variation. For
domain sizes L  Lc , FD variations would eventually appear to be random for hBk i = 0 µG. Thus, the
form of the intrinsic Faraday depth variation depends on the number of turbulent cells along the LOS and
does not necessarily look like a random function for shorter path-lengths. However, when combined with
the variations in emissivity to produce the intrinsic Faraday depth spectrum the smoothness in FD along
the LOS is not translated into a smooth spectrum.
The intrinsic polarized emissivity and Faraday depth combine to give the intrinsic Faraday depth
spectrum shown by the blue points in the middle and right columns of Fig. 11. Note that these have been
normalized to the maximum RM clean component, so only the relative variation contains useful information.
Also shown in these panels is the spectrum obtained by RM synthesis and its clean components. The
Faraday depth spectra are highly complex with multiple peaks and clean components referred to as a
“Faraday forest” by Beck et al. [66]. These spectra are also clearly different from that obtained using

delta-correlated Gaussian random field as an approximation to turbulence shown in Fig. 10 (right-hand
panel).
It is clear that the Faraday depth spectra are also very different from the intrinsic model spectra. RM
synthesis tends to select a few strong peaks which are not always the FD along the entire LOS, nor are
they closely related to features in the intrinsic polarized emission. This illustrates a fundamental difficulty
in interpreting RM synthesis data. It may be wrong to interpret some of the narrow, high peaks as the
action of a Faraday screen, or a Faraday-thin component: a region in which there is no polarized emission,
but which produces Faraday rotation. However, the corresponding left panels show that there is emission
from all locations along the LOS.
A further difficulty in interpretation arises because the maximum absolute value of the Faraday depth
along a LOS is not necessarily the Faraday depth through the entire box. The latter is shown by the green

Version November 21, 2019 accepted in Galaxies

dash-dot line in the middle and right columns of Fig. 11. For example, in the first row of Fig. 11 the
spectrum obtained by RM synthesis has strong peaks at FD ≈ 0 and FD ≈ −300 rad m−2 and looking at
the left panel we see these correspond respectively to the emission generated at the front and back of the
LOS. However, in the second row, the emission that produces the strong spectral peak near FD = 0 rad m−2
comes from emission from both the front and back of the layer. The Faraday depth through the entire layer
is FD = 1.67 rad m−2 and the maximum along this LOS, FD ≈ −80 rad m−2 originates from the middle.
There is no way yet, that we are aware of, to reliably recover any of the true properties of the Faraday
depth along the LOS from the Faraday depth spectrum alone. Images produced using the strongest spectral
peak or the maximum absolute FD as proxies for some assumed property of a source, such as, its intrinsic
polarized emissivity or the total Faraday depth through it, may be misleading.
Pronounced peaks in the Faraday depth spectrum of a synchrotron emitting medium can arise in two
ways. A strong peak in emissivity from a region where the FD is changing slowly over a small distance will
produce a narrow FD feature: an example is in the third row of Fig. 11, where the strong emission from a
distance between 190 and 210 pc, where the FD profile shows a step-like feature, produces the spectral
peak at FD ≈ 100 rad m−2 . Alternatively, when the FD is constant, or changing slowly over large distances,
comparatively weaker emission builds up at this FD and results in a peak in the spectrum: in the third row
of Fig. 11 we see that FD ≈ 200 rad m−2 between the distance 250 and 450 pc along the LOS, producing a
pronounced peak at this FD in the spectrum. Such a scenario can occur when the angle of the polarized
emission is changing slowly with distance. In neither case does a strong peak in the spectrum result from a
Faraday screen. Whilst the origin of some spectral peaks can be approximately described by one of these
mechanisms, there are also many peaks whose origin is not so simple and are discussed in the next section.
Multiple polarized components in Faraday depth spectrum is a natural consequence when the LOS
passes through a few coherent scales. We believe, in the case when the LOS traverse through statistically
large (asymptotically infinite) number of turbulent cells, Faraday depth spectrum similar to that obtained
for delta-correlated random fields could perhaps be obtained. Given the typical driving scale of turbulence
in the ISM, e.g., ∼ 50–100 pc when driven by supernova [42,68], and the typical length of LOS through the
ISM of a few kiloparsec, achieving such a limit is highly unlikely. Unfortunately, the MHD simulations used
here do not allow us to test this scenario. At present we are not aware of any reliable method which can be
used to interpret Faraday depth spectra that originate in a turbulent, synchrotron emitting region. Since
turbulence and cosmic ray electrons are thought to be present throughout the ISM this problem requires
careful investigation.
7.3. Comparing clean components to the intrinsic Faraday depth spectrum
In Fig. 11, the blue points showing the intrinsic emission at each Faraday depth are present between
the main peaks in the spectra obtained by RM synthesis and RM clean. This is because, structures in
FD are smoothed by the RMSF. In order to make a better comparison between the observed and intrinsic
spectra it is important to consider the number of emitters in a given range of Faraday depths that is
compatible with the resolution of the RMSF. We therefore binned synchrotron emissivities within a range
of FD, with the bin-size determined by the RMSF. In our case, we used the bin-size ∆FD = RMSF/2.
The choice of this bin-size is motivated by the fact that we wanted to Nyquist sample the RMSF. This is
equivalent to the sum of polarized intensities (εbin ) arising in the range FD ± ∆FD/2 and εbin is given by,
εbin (FD) =

X

ε(FDi ) ≡ Nbin hεbin i, where FDi ∈ [FD − ∆FD/2, FD + ∆FD/2].

(5)

FDi

Here, Nbin is the number of synchrotron emitting elements within a FD bin computed from the simulation
and hεbin i is the mean polarized synchrotron emissivity of that FD bin. As the intrinsic polarization angle

Version November 21, 2019 accepted in Galaxies

20 of 30

of the synchrotron emission do not fluctuate strongly (as can be seen by the smooth colour variation of the
angle of the polarized synchrotron emission in the left column of Fig. 11), simple addition of the polarized
emissivities will not affect our conclusions. The black points in the middle and right columns of Fig. 11
show εbin located at the mean FD of the corresponding bin with the maximum value of εbin normalized
to the peak value of the FD clean components. It is clear from the middle and the right-hand panels of
Fig. 11 that the sum of polarized emission in FD bins captures the RM clean components, including their
relative amplitudes, remarkably well.
Note that, strong εbin , and thus a peak in the Faraday depth spectrum can originate either due to —
(1) strong emissivity at a location along the LOS (large hεbin i), or due to (2) build up from several weaker
emissions that have FD within ±RMSF/4 (large Nbin ). In fact, both these scenarios can occur along the
same LOS. For example, in the top row of Fig. 11, the peak near −300 rad m−2 originates due to the first
case, while the peak near 0 rad m−2 is because of the second case. In the second row of Fig. 11, the peak
near 0 rad m−2 is a consequence of the second case although the polarized emission in that FD bin originate
from both front and back of the sightline. This clearly demonstrates that, for a turbulent magneto-ionic
medium which is simultaneously synchrotron emitting and Faraday rotating, a peak in the Faraday depth
spectrum corresponds to the polarized emission summed roughly within ±RMSF/4, which necessarily may
not arise from regions along the LOS that are spatially continuous. Therefore, special care must be taken
when interpreting FD maps constructed through RM synthesis and relating them to the FD of the emitting
volume, especially when the Faraday depth spectrum appears to be well resolved.
This brings out the important fact that, even if a broad-band observation is sensitive to extended
structures in Faraday depth space and can resolve them, as our synthetic observations are, the RMSF plays
an important role in determining the amplitudes of the clean components. Moreover, when performing RM
synthesis for diffuse emissions, sharp peaks in the Faraday depth spectrum that are consistent with the
width of the RMSF do not necessarily imply the presence of a Faraday rotating screen in the foreground of
a synchrotron emitting volume.
Our investigation on Faraday depth spectra is based on a diffuse isothermal magneto-ionic medium
as a representative Galactic ISM that contains transonic compressible turbulence. It is possible that the
conditions of turbulence in different parts of the Galactic magneto-ionic medium could be of different
type, including the distribution and direction of the regular magnetic fields. The conclusions regarding the
origin of Faraday complexity and various peaks in the Faraday depth spectrum are expected to be general.
However, depending on the spatial smoothness of the turbulent fields (for example, sub- or super-sonic
turbulence) and strength of the regular fields, the peaks in Faraday depth spectrum could become smoother
or merge together. In other words, the clumpyness of a well resolved Faraday depth spectrum could provide
hints on the nature of turbulence in a magneto-ionic medium. Therefore, quantifications of the shape of
Faraday depth spectrum beyond the recently used skewness and kurtosis [39] is necessary to be investigated
to distinguish between different types of turbulent medium.
8. Conclusions
We have investigated in detail various features in Faraday depth spectra obtained from synthetic
broad-band spectro-polarimetric observations in the frequency range 0.5 to 6 GHz sampled with 500
frequency channels. We have developed a new software package, COSMIC, wherein a user can freely choose
from several possible options to generate synthetic observations. In this work the synthetic observations
were obtained from MHD simulations of an isothermal, transonic, compressible turbulence in a plasma,
similar to that observed in the Galactic ISM. For comparison, we have also studied the Faraday depth
spectrum for a simple delta-correlated Gaussian random description of turbulent magnetic fields. We reach
the following conclusions:

Version November 21, 2019 accepted in Galaxies

1. For the MHD simulations used, Faraday depth varies smoothly with distance along the lines of sight
due to spatially correlated structures in the magnetic field. Faraday depth varies on scales of ∼ 200 pc,
similar to the driving scale of turbulence in the simulations used in this work.
2. Strong Faraday depolarization at long wavelengths gives rise to canal-like small-scale structures in the
polarized synchrotron emission. At the resolution of the MHD simulations used here, the polarized
synchrotron emission below ∼ 1 GHz shows spatial variation on few pixel scales that correspond to
few parsecs.
3. For the choice of our frequency coverage, the synthetic observations are sensitive to structures
extended up to ∼ 1250 rad m−2 in Faraday depth space and resolve them with RMSF of 10 rad m−2 .
This allowed us to perform a high resolution investigation of Faraday depth spectra. Faraday depth
spectra for a medium containing Gaussian random magnetic fields that are delta-correlated are
significantly different in structure as compared to those obtained from MHD simulations of a medium
containing random magnetic fields that are spatially correlated. The latter is expected to be a closer
representation of the diffuse ISM.
4. Faraday depth spectra of individual sightlines through the MHD cube show a combination of narrow
and broad features, which cannot be described as a linear combination of simple models that are
typically used when polarization data are analysed. The narrow structures are mostly consistent
with the width of the RMSF containing a single FD clean component, typically considered as a
signature of a medium that is only Faraday rotating, although the entire simulation volume is emitting
synchrotron radiation.
5. We find that, modelling RM clean components of the Faraday depth spectrum as discrete emitters
along a line of sight where, at a physical distance, the synchrotron emissivity of the emitters is located
at the Faraday depth to that distance does not represent the clean components obtained from RM
clean.
6. The clean components and their relative emissivities obtained from RM clean are well represented by
the sum of polarized synchrotron emissivity in a Faraday depth bin of bin-size RMSF/2.
7. Since the Faraday depth spectrum depends on the interplay of the emissivity εsync and the local
Faraday depth, the complicated structures in Faraday depth can be explained as follows:
– Strong sharp peaks in the spectrum can be produced due to reasons: (i) strong εsync at a single
FD, or, (ii) build up of weaker εsync over a range of distance, not necessarily continuous, that have
roughly constant FD, or whose FD lies in the range FD − RMSF/4 and FD + RMSF/4.
– Broad spectral features are produced by: (iii) a gradient in FD at a constant εsync . Deviations from
“constant” εsync or FD produce sub-structure on (ii) and (iii).
8. Our analysis shows that it is highly non-trivial to infer the Faraday depths, i.e. the integral
R
0.812 ne Bk dl along the entire LOS, for a diffuse medium that emits synchrotron radiation if
turbulent magnetic fields are dominant.
The turbulent magneto-ionic medium in a real astrophysical source is expected to be further complicated
as compared to our simplified assumptions on its properties, such as, a constant density of CREs having
constant power-law spectral energy distribution, a constant ionization fraction of the neutral gas and
above all, an ideal telescope response. In such scenarios, the generality of our investigation regarding
peaks in Faraday depth spectrum originating due to accumulation of synchrotron emissivity within a range
of FD determined by the RMSF is expected to hold true. The complication stems from the fact that,
whether the stronger synchrotron emissivity is a consequence of magnetic fields alone or due to variations
in density of CREs or due to variations in their energy spectrum, will remain degenerate. In the presence
of telescope systematics and noise, complications can be even more difficult to disentangle. With several
upcoming broad-band spectro-polarimetric surveys of the diffuse Galactic emission and other surveys for
extragalactic sources that are targeting major astrophysical questions, interpreting results obtained from

spectro-polarimetric data analysis techniques in general, and RM synthesis technique in particular, requires
improved statistical methods.

Appendix A. Computerized Observations of Simulated MHD Inferred Cubes: COSMIC
Here, we discuss the details of numerical calculations performed by COSMIC to generate synthetic
observations. COSMIC uses MHD simulation generated cubes in Cartesian coordinate system and assumes
the z-axis as the default line of sight axis. However, any of the perpendicular axis of the six faces of the
cube can be chosen by the user as the line of sight axis. In the following, we will present our calculations in
the default coordinate system.
Appendix A.1. Synchrotron emissivity
The cubes of Bx and By are used to compute the magnetic field strength in the plane of the sky,
B⊥ = (Bx2 + By2 )1/2 , which is used to compute the synchrotron emissivity, εsync , at a frequency ν in each
cell as,
e−(ν/νc )
1−α α
.
(A1)
εsync,ν = N0 nCRE B⊥
ν
[1 + (ν/νbr )γ ]
Here, nCRE is the number density of CRE, N0 is an arbitrary normalization factor, α is the spectral index
of the synchrotron emission, γ is the spectral curvature parameter, and νbr and νc defines the position of a
break and cut-off frequency in the synchrotron spectrum.
Although some MHD simulations do include cosmic rays, here we apply COSMIC to a MHD simulation
which does not have information on cosmic ray electrons, i.e., effects of their propagation and energy losses.
In the scenario when nCRE is unavailable, synchrotron emissivity is computed using one of the following
assumptions:

(1) Constant nCRE throughout the 3-D spatial cube.
(2) Cosmic rays follow local energy equipartition per mesh point, such that, nCRE = Bx2 + By2 + Bz2 . We
note, however, that such a distribution of CRE is likely to be unphysical as equipartition conditions are
unlikely to hold on small scales [69].
(3) Cosmic rays follows energy equipartition over an user defined volume such that, nCRE = σx2 + σy2 + σz2 ,
where σx,y,z are the root mean square of the x, y and z component of the magnetic field computed over
the defined volume centered at the mesh point of computation. The typical scale where magnetic fields
and CRE are expected to be in energy equipartition is approximately given by the diffusion length-scale
p
(ldiff ) of CRE [see, e.g., 69]. When CRE propagation is dominated by diffusion, ldiff ≈ 1.8 kpc D28 tsync,8 .
Here, D28 is the diffusion coefficient in units of 1028 cm2 s−1 and tsync,8 is the synchrotron lifetime in
units of 108 years. If CRE propagation is dominated by streaming instabilities at the Alfvén speed, then
ldiff ≈ 1 kpc (vA,10 tsync,8 ). Here, vA,10 is the Alfvén speed in units of 10 km s−1 .
The MHD simulation box used in the main text has a size of 512 pc. This is significantly smaller
than the typically expected CRE propagation length-scales mentioned above. We have therefore used the
option of constant nCRE and assumed that the CREs have power-law energy distribution so that γ = 0
and νc → ∞.
The normalization N0 is chosen such that the MHD cube produces a certain integrated flux density
S0 (in Jy) at a certain reference frequency ν0 . Both S0 and ν0 are user specified. In the main text, we
chose S0 = 10 Jy at ν0 = 1 GHz.
Appendix A.2. Faraday rotation
In the default coordinate system Bk = Bz . The Faraday rotation produced in each cell is,
FDcell = 0.812 ne Bk lpix .

(A2)

Here, ne is the thermal electron density (in cm−3 ) and lpix is the physical size of each pixel (in pc). The
thermal electron density ne is computed from the simulation cube of gas density using one of the following
methods:
(1) For isothermal simulations, ne = fion ngas , where fion is a constant ionization fraction throughout the
volume. Here, ngas is the gas number density and is computed from the simulations.
(2) For the case when the gas at temperature T is collisionally ionized, ne is computed using Saha’s
ionization formula for hydrogen gas in thermal equilibrium,

(A3)

where, λB is the de Broglie wavelength and k is the Boltzmann constant. In this case, the 3-D spatial
distribution of temperature (T ) is required as an input.
(3) In the warm ionized medium, the interstellar gas is mostly ionized by ultraviolet radiation [70]. In such
cases, a simple model for ionization fraction as a function of temperature can be chosen, with a continuous
arctan-type transition from fion = 0 to fion = 1 at a specified temperature.
Since the MHD simulation used in this work is isothermal and we have assumed that there is no
ultraviolet radiation field in the simulated volume, we used the option of constant fion in the main text
and the choice of its value is discussed in Section 5.

In the default coordinate system, the cubes are integrated along the k-index which is the z-direction.
Thus, the Faraday depth of a pixel at (i, j, k) is computed by summing the FDcell of each point along the
k-index as,

FD(i, j, k ) =
FDcell (i, j, k 0 ).
(A4)
k 0 =0

Here, i, j and k are index along the x-, y- and z-axes, respectively.
Appendix A.3. Linear polarization parameters
The maximum fractional polarization of the synchrotron emission (pmax ) in each cell of the 3-D spatial
cube depends on the spectral index α as,
pmax =

1−α
,
5/3 − α

(A5)

and, the Stokes Q and U emissivities (εQ,ν and εU ,ν , respectively) at each cell at a frequency ν are computed
as;
εQ,ν = pmax εsync,ν cos (2 θ0 ) .
(A6)
εU ,ν = pmax εsync,ν sin (2 θ0 ) .

Here, FD0 (i, j, k ) = FD(i, j, k ) − FDcell (i, j, k )/2. Because each of the cell in the simulation is also emitting
polarized synchrotron emission, the amount of Faraday rotation it undergoes within itself is FDcell /2
instead of FDcell [30]. It is important to note, in addition to the Faraday rotation experienced by a cell, the
emission also undergoes Faraday depolarization due to LOS component of magnetic field within its own cell.
However, the above expressions assumes that the Faraday depolarization within each cell to be negligible.
Depending on the typical values of FDcell in a MHD simulation, this assumption can break down towards
low frequencies and thereby limits application of COSMIC below certain frequencies. For the simulations
used in this work, COSMIC can be used to generate synthetic observations above ∼ 0.5 GHz (see Section 5).
The linearly polarized intensity map is then computed as,
P Iν (i, j ) =

Appendix A.4. Current limitations of COSMIC
Here, we list the computational approximations used in COSMIC and the limitations of applying COSMIC
for obtaining the observables.

1. All spatial averaging of intensities over a desired sky area are calculated as simple arithmetic averages
instead of the Gaussian averaging of a telescope beam.
2. All observable intensities — total and polarized synchrotron emission, and Stokes Q and U parameters
— are computed for monochromatic frequencies. In other words the frequency channels are assumed
to be sufficiently narrow such that bandwidth depolarization is negligible.
3. We assume Faraday depolarization effects within each 3-D mesh point of the simulation to be
negligible.
4. We do not sample images using the u − v coverage of an interferometer array. Therefore emission
from all spatial scales are included in the images which is equivalent to observations performed
using a single-dish radio telescope. Note that, a mis-match in u − v coverage can manifest itself as
complicated structures in the total and polarized synchrotron intensity maps.
5. We assume that the total synchrotron emission is optically thin and the frequency spectrum follows
either a simple power-law for the entire frequency range or a curved spectrum parametrized by
νbr and/or νc in Eq. (A1). The diffuse synchrotron emission is expected to be optically thick at
frequencies below ∼ 50 MHz. Such a low frequency is not investigated here and will require rigorous
radiative transfer equations to be incorporated into COSMIC.
6. COSMIC integrates through sightlines parallel to the axis of the input MHD cubes and thus is only
applicable for emission from a region far away from the observer. We plan to implement diverging
lines of sight in a later version.
7. Currently, COSMIC only computes the different polarization parameters that describe the synchrotron
emission and not other emission mechanisms, like the thermal free–free emission. Estimation of the
free–free emission is important to study the broad-band emission properties in galaxies.
