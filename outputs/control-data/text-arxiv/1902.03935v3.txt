We demonstrate full quantum state control of two species of single atoms using optical tweezers
and assemble the atoms into a molecule. Our demonstration includes 3D ground-state cooling
of a single atom (Cs) in an optical tweezer, transport by several microns with minimal heating,
and merging with a single Na atom. Subsequently, both atoms occupy the simultaneous motional
ground state with 61(4)% probability. This realizes a sample of exactly two co-trapped atoms near
the phase-space-density limit of one, and allows for efficient stimulated-Raman transfer of a pair of
atoms into a molecular bound state of the triplet electronic ground potential a3 Σ+ . The results are
key steps toward coherent creation of single ultracold molecules, for future exploration of quantum
simulation and quantum information processing.

INTRODUCTION

Building up complex many-body systems from simpler,
well-understood constituents is a promising approach toward understanding and controlling quantum mechanical
behavior. Using ultracold molecules as building blocks
would allow new explorations of quantum chemical dynamics [1], novel quantum many-body phases [2], and
quantum computation [3–5].
These prospects hinge on the precise generation and
control of ultracold molecules with well defined internal
and motional quantum states. Many approaches for trapping and cooling molecules to ultracold temperatures are
being pursued [6–16]. Recent highlights include rapid
progress made with laser cooling of molecules [17–20],
the creation of quantum degenerate gases of fermionic
KRb [21], assembling single molecules [22] and loading
single molecules into an optical tweezer array [23]. Bulk
samples of ultracold molecules have already proven a versatile platform, enabling the study of ultracold chemistry [24] and quantum spin models [25]. In addition,
strongly interacting phenomena can be explored with a
lower entropy gas and with single molecule addressability [26]. Inspired by techniques in optical single atom
manipulation [27–32], we proposed a realization through
single particle control of molecules without relying on
collisions for cooling [33].
In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate key steps
toward such an “ultracold molecular assembler” [33].
We obtain full quantum state control including cooling,
transport, and merging of two different single atoms. We
perform two-photon dark resonance spectroscopy to locate the least-bound NaCs molecular state of the electronic triplet ground potential a3 Σ+ .

FIG. 1. Single atom trapping and transport for molecular assembly. (a) Schematic of apparatus. Two neighboring optical tweezers at 976 nm and 700 nm trap a single Cs
(blue) and Na (orange) atom in the vacuum chamber. Both
tweezer beams are combined on a dichroic mirror and focused
by an objective. The 976 nm tweezer can be moved in the
focal plane by changing the drive frequency of an upstream
acousto-optic deflector (AOD). Once atoms are cooled and
merged into the same tweezer, a laser propagating along kR
transfers them into a bound molecular state in the presence of
a quantization B field. (b) Experimental assembly steps
of ultracold molecules demonstrated in this paper. A
single Na and Cs atom are cooled, merged into the same trap,
and transferred to a weakly-bound molecule. (c) Single-shot
fluorescence image of single Na and Cs atoms in adjacent tweezers separated by 3 µm.

We then transfer two single ground state-cooled atoms
in the same tweezer to the weakly-bound molecular state
using a two-photon Raman pulse. In the following sections, we detail each experimental assembly step.

CONTROLLING THE QUANTIZED
MOTION OF ATOMS

A schematic of the apparatus is shown in Fig. 1.
As described in our previously work [22], we generate
two tweezer traps at different wavelengths for quasiindependent manipulation of single Na and Cs atoms.
One of the beams is steerable, so that initially separate
tweezer traps can be merged. Single-atom fluorescence
images confirm simultaneous trapping of single Na and
Cs atoms side-by-side as shown in Fig. 1.
Using standard polarization gradient cooling (PGC), it
is possible to cool the motion of single Cs or Na atoms to
an average of tens of quanta in a tight tweezer trap. To
further cool the atoms into the lowest motional state, we
use 3-dimensional Raman Sideband Cooling (3D RSC),
first demonstrated with single ions [34] and more recently
with single neutral atoms [29, 30, 35]. We operate in
the resolved sideband regime where the linewidth of the
cooling transition is less than the trap frequency (10100’s of kHz). We have previously demonstrated groundstate cooling of single Na [32]. Here, we demonstrate
3D RSC of a single Cs atom in an optical tweezer. To
our knowledge, we report the highest 3D ground-state
probability for single atoms in tweezers to date.
The RSC sequence consists of two steps: a coherent
two-photon Raman transition that connects two internal
states while removing a motional quantum, and an optical pumping (OP) step that re-initializes the internal
state of the atom. The two steps are repeated until the
atom reaches the motional ground state.
In our scheme (Fig. 2), the Raman transition occurs
between Cs ground-state hyperfine levels |F = 4, mF =
−4; ni and |3, −3; n − 1i, which are about 9.2 GHz apart.
Here, n is the motional quantum number. The transition is driven by two phase-locked diode lasers, “F3” and
“F4”, both red-detuned by ∆ = 2π × 44 GHz from the
Cs D2 line at 852 nm, and with Rabi rates ΩF 3 and
ΩF 4 , respectively. The tweezer has a power of 14.3 mW
and beam waist of 0.84 µm. To achieve motional coupling, the laser beams are arranged as shown in the inset
of Fig. 2(a). This configuration yields substantial twophoton momentum transfer, ∆~k = ~kF 4(i) − ~kF 3 , while
the energy difference associated with the hyperfine level
and motional state change is supplied by their relative
detuning, δ. This resonance condition is maintained for
all relevant motional states, n.
The atom is initially prepared in |4, −4i by OP (independently of the motional state, n). For this, we use
σ − -polarized beams resonant with |4, −3i → |4′ , −4i and
|3, −3i → |4′ , −4i transitions, where the primed levels denote sub levels of the 6P3/2 manifold of Cs. During the
first step of RSC, a Raman π-pulse drives the transition
|4, −4; ni → |3, −3; n − 1i. Subsequently, OP pumps the
atom to |4, −4; n − 1i. OP preserves the motional state
with high probability. Thus, in each RSC cycle, n decreases on average. The process repeats until the atom
reaches the dark state |4, −4; 0i, thereby deterministi-

cally preparing the internal and the motional quantum
state of the atom.
We switch between the three Raman F4(i) directions in
the sequence i = 3, 1, 2, 1 to cool the atomic motion along
all three axes of the tweezer. The tweezer potential has
a cigar shape with two near-degenerate, tightly confined.
radial directions and a loosely confined axial (along the
tweezer beam propagation) direction.
The linewidth of the Raman transition is Fourier
broadened due to the finite duration of a π-pulse, which
is inversely related to the peak effective Raman Rabi rate
ΩF 3 ΩF 4 /2∆ = 2π × 33 kHz (2π × 7 kHz) for radial (axial) trap axes. The smaller energy splitting of the axial
motion necessitates a smaller Raman coupling along that
direction. An 8.6 G magnetic field is applied throughout
RSC along the OP propagation direction to define the
quantization axis.
All Raman pulses in this experiment for cooling and
spectroscopy use a Blackman window temporal intensity
profile to reduce off-resonant excitation of the carrier.
The starting temperature of 9.2 µK, corresponding to a
mean axial motional quantum number n̄a = 9, leads to
non-negligible occupation of levels up to na ≈ 40.
√
Due to the
n scaling of sideband transition
strengths [36], it was necessary to “sweep” the Raman pulse durations in descending order starting from
ninit
a =41. Furthermore, to overcome decoherence, which
reduces the transfer fidelity of each pulse, we repeat
the sweep, but each time with a smaller ninit
=
a
{41, 31, 16, 11, 6}. The entire process takes ≈ 100 ms.
We characterize two cooling experiments in Fig. 2(b):
(1) sub-optimal cooling was used with slightly offresonant δ 6= ωtrap to reveal the location of the ∆n = −1
sidebands. (2) optimal cooling is obtained by setting
δ = ωtrap , as determined by the sideband locations in
(1).
To characterize the cooling performance, we use sideband thermometry [34]. Following RSC, we measure
the ratio of ∆n = −1 and ∆n = +1 Raman sideband
transition heights. A successful transition changes the
state from |4, −4i to |3, −3i and is revealed by state selective imaging: light that is resonant with the cycling
|4, −4i → |5′ , −5i transition ejects only |4, −4i atoms.
The remaining atoms in |3, −3i are then imaged. We
obtain the average occupation number n̄ from the ratio
n̄
of sideband heights via I−1 /I+1 = n̄+1
. By assuming
a thermal distribution, we extract a temperature and a
ground state probability along each axis. The product
of the ground state probabilities in all three dimensions
gives the 3D ground state probability P03D .
This
procedure
yields
{n̄a , n̄r1 , n̄r2 }
=
{0.03(3), 0.00(1), 0.01(1)},
corresponding
to
P03D ≥ 96(3)% for optimal cooling.
The signal contrast in Fig 2B does not reach unity due
to the ≈ 300 µs coherence time for driving motional sideband transitions. Furthermore, different pulse durations
were used on the two radial axes, leading to a further difference in contrast. However, the sideband ratios, used to

A final consideration is that any wait time between
the end of RSC and molecule formation needs to be minimized because the atoms can be heated by off-resonantly
scattering photons from their respective tweezers. This

waiting, we perform the Na and Cs RSC sequences concurrently so that they end at the same time. We have
verified experimentally that RSC of one species does not
affect the atom of the other species.
III. PREPARING BOTH NA AND CS IN THE
GROUND STATE OF THE SAME TWEEZER

As shown in Fig. 1, two optical tweezers trap a single Cs and Na atom approximately 3 µm apart. Both
tweezer beams are combined on a dichroic mirror and focused by a NA= 0.55 objective. The position of the Cs
tweezer can be moved by changing the drive frequency
of an upstream acousto-optic deflector (AOD). While
merging two separately confined identical ground-state
atoms into one potential well requires delicate quantum
tunneling [37], merging different atomic species is more
straightforward. Due to their different atomic polarizability as a function of wavelength, two different color
optical tweezers allow the two atoms to be manipulated
quasi-independently [22].
One tweezer beam at a wavelength of 700 nm confines

Na at the intensity maximum while repelling Cs. A second tweezer beam at a wavelength of 976 nm strongly
confines Cs while weakly attracting Na. As shown in
Fig. 3(a), translation of the 976 nm beam to overlap the
700 nm beam, followed by gradual turn-off of the 700 nm
beam leaves the two atoms confined in the same tweezer
trap, all within 10 ms. The exact trajectory is detailed
in Appendix A.
After running this sequence (in the absence of Na)
followed by its time reverse for detection, Raman sideband thermometry on the separated tweezer shows
minimal motional excitation of Cs ({∆n̄a , ∆n̄r1 } =
{0.01(5), 0.00(2)}) (Fig. 3(b)).
We further explore different trap powers for merging
of Cs and Na atoms into one tweezer. To prevent spinchanging collisions [22], we first prepare Na in |2, 2i and
Cs in |4, 4i. Then, we merge the atoms and measure
the joint axial ground state fraction PnNaa=0 × PnCs
as a
a =0
function of beam powers (Fig. 3(c)). We identify three
issues that can cause excess heating during the merge
and require careful beam-power selection to overcome:
1. The 976 nm beam can make Na spill from the 700
nm tweezer and gain kinetic energy. This limits the
ratio P700nm /P976nm to be above 0.37, indicated by
the red triangle in Fig. 3(c), and the left panel at
5.7 ms in Fig. 3(a).
2. The 700 nm beam can dominate the 976 nm beam
and repel Cs from the trap. This limits the power

FIG. 3. Merging atoms in two tweezers while maintaining quantum motional states. (a) Radial cuts of optical
potential experienced by Na and Cs during the merge time sequence. Blue and orange lines show paths of the 976 nm
and 700 nm tweezers, respectively. The 976 nm tweezer containing Cs is translated by 2.95 µm in 7.6 ms until it overlaps with
the 700 nm tweezer. Then, the 700 nm tweezer power is linearly ramped from 48 mW to 0 mW in 1.5 ms, followed by a 50 µs
wait. Dashed potential in the left 5.7 ms panel (marked by red square) shows the conditions for non-ideal tweezer powers,
leading to spilling of Na. Dashed potential in the 8.55 ms panel (marked by red circle) shows the conditions for a different set of
non-ideal tweezer powers giving rise to anti-trapping for Cs. (b) Raman sideband spectroscopy to characterize heating
associated with atom transport. Top: A control experiment holding the atoms stationary for 18 ms. Bottom: After the
round-trip merge sequence (the sequence shown in (a) followed by its time reverse) Dashed blue lines indicate expected position

Fig. 3(c), and the right panel at 8.55 ms in Fig. 3a.
3. Modulation in the tweezer power during trap movement causes parametric heating of the atoms. A
weak acoustic standing wave in the AOD crystal results in an overall efficiency that modulates ∼ 1.5%
with the acoustic drive frequency.
We choose powers of P976nm = 14.3 mW and
P700nm =7.1 mW (also used in Fig. 3(b)) for all subsequent experiments. These powers yield the trap potentials depicted by the solid lines in Fig. 3(a)), i.e.,

approximately 2 mK for Cs and 1 mK for Na, respectively. We characterize with 3D Raman sideband thermometry that we have prepared two atoms in the same
tweezer with a phase space density (PSD) of P0N a ×P0Cs =
0.80(3) × 0.76(4) = 0.61(4). In this experiment, lower
optical pumping fidelity resulted in a higher initial Cs
temperature as compared to Sec. 2.

with a FWHM of 8(2) kHz, indicating transfer of the atom pair to the weakly-bound molecular state.

IV. TWO-PHOTON RAMAN TRANSFER TO
THE LEAST-BOUND MOLECULAR GROUND
STATE

After the merge, both Na |F = 2, mF = 2i and Cs
|4, 4i atoms occupy the motional ground state of the
same tweezer, which corresponds to the vibrational level
v ′′ = 25 of the combined tweezer potential and electronic ground molecular potential a3 Σ+ [33]. As shown in
Fig. 4(a), we transfer the atom pair into the least-bound
molecular state v ′′ = −1 (or v ′′ = 24) via a two-photon
Raman pulse using two beams L1 and L2 that couple the
initial and final states to a single intermediate electronic
excited state.
The creation of a molecule in the weakly-bound state is
an important step toward subsequent transfer to deeplybound molecular states via Stimulated Raman Adiabatic
Passage (STIRAP) [7–16]. In previous work, weaklybound molecules were produced using Fano-Feshbach resonances. In this work, we instead use an all-optical technique [38] to generalize the weakly-bound molecule production to atoms without suitable Fano-Feshbach resonances.
We choose v ′ = 0 of the molecular potential c3 Σ+ as
the excited intermediate state because it has suitable
Franck-Condon factors (FCF’s) with both the initial and
final states, and because its large detuning from the nearthreshold and trap states minimizes their contribution to
spontaneous emission [33]. We choose the weakly-bound
ground state v ′′ = −1 as our target state because its FCF
is the most similar to that of the motional ground state

(v ′′ = 25). The spontaneous emission from the excited
state during Raman transfer is proportional to the ratio of the FCF’s of the two ground states to the excited
state. While a STIRAP pulse sequence could also potentially be used for this transfer, we have found from
simulations that large Stark shifts of the two-photon detuning and the longer required duration result in poor
efficiency.
Initial search for the intermediate excited state relied
on photoassociation (PA) spectroscopy of the two atoms.
Guided by the c3 Σ+ potential curve from Ref. [39], we
scanned the frequency of a tunable diode laser around
1038 nm wavelength (L1 ) until the laser was resonant
with the excited state, and molecule formation was indicated by simultaneous atom loss.
Specifically, after illuminating the atoms for 75 ms with
15 mW of σ + polarized light and a beam radius of w ≈ 15
µm, the atom merge sequence was immediately reversed
to separate the surviving atoms for detection. The twobody loss spectrum is shown in Fig. 4(b). The Lorentzian
fit gives a transition frequency of 288,698.54(6) GHz,
′
′
′
which we identify as the c3 Σ+
Ω=1 (v = 0, J = 2, F = 7)
state, where J ′ is total angular momentum excluding nuclear spin, and F ′ is the total angular momentum including nuclear spin. The uncertainty is dominated by
the wavemeter inaccuracy of 60 MHz. We also observe
the J ′ = 1 and J ′ = 3 rotational lines and fit them to
vJ ′ = v0 + BJ ′ (J ′ + 1) to obtain a rotational constant of
B = 1.1 GHz The lack of a J ′ = 0 state confirms Ω = 1.
To achieve two-photon Raman transfer to the ground
molecular state, we first located the least-bound state

6
a3 Σ+ (v ′′ = 24, N ′′ = 0, F ′′ = 6) via dark-resonance
spectroscopy and calibrated the single-photon Rabi rates
of the two individual beams (Appendix E). We then increased the detuning ∆ in order to reduce population of
the excited state, which decays rapidly.
Figure 4c shows the Raman resonance for a pulse
length of 100 ms and ∆ = 2π × 3.2 GHz. The two
beams L1 and L2 propagate along kR as shown in Fig. 1,
with beam radii {w0x , w0y } = {10, 23} µm and identical beam powers of 15 mW to minimize scattering (Appendix F). The resonance is fit to a Lorentzian centered
at 298.0795(6) MHz with a FWHM of 8(2) kHz. The
70(10)% transfer efficiency matches closely to the relative ground-state fraction of the Na+Cs atom pair, while
the 21(2)% background level can be explained by spontaneous Raman scattering of the tweezer light from the
v ′′ = 25 state, followed by a spin-changing collision [22].
We have not yet observed coherent atom-molecule oscillations between the initial and final state and believe
the main source of decoherence is off-resonant scattering of the Raman light from the least-bound molecular
state. For the above conditions, this scattering rate is
ΓRaman ≈ 149 Hz, larger than the Raman transfer rate
ΩR = 2π × 50 Hz. Although increasing the detuning ∆
improves the ratio of Raman transfer to scattering rate,
the fixed scattering rate of Γtweezer = 30 Hz due to the
tweezer (Appendix G) provided a further constraint.
A potential solution for future work is replacing the
976 nm tweezer with a 1038 nm tweezer that can also
serve as the molecular transfer beam. Due to the tight
focusing of the tweezer, the product Ω1 Ω2 can be more
than 200 times higher for the same beam power, thereby
allowing ∆ to increase to reduce off-resonant scattering,
while maintaining the same ΩR .

SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

We have described experimental steps towards coherent assembly of single molecules from individual atoms.
Starting with side-by-side trapping of the constituent
atoms (Cs and Na) in optical tweezers, we have demonstrated ground-state cooling of Cs to its 3D ground state
(96 %) and merging single Cs and Na atoms into the
same tweezer while maintaining both atoms in the motional ground state with 61 % probability. These tools of
dual-species single-atom manipulation can be extended
to other species and tweezer wavelengths, providing a
valuable resource to investigate interactions, collisions,
and coherent spectroscopy and creation of molecules.
With two atoms in a tweezer, we have probed their
electronic ground and excited molecular potentials. The
resulting information enabled two-photon Raman transfer of 70 % of the atom pairs into the least bound molecular state of the triplet ground electronic potential a3 Σ+ .
In the future, deriving the molecular transfer and tweezer
beams from a single laser may reduce off-resonant scat-

tering of the transferred molecule, which is otherwise
long-lived. The transfer from the weakly-bound state to
the ro-vbirational ground state could then be achieved
by performing STIRAP with an excited state from the
mixed potentials B 1 Π and c3 Σ.
For studies of ultracold chemistry, quantum information, and many-body physics, the number of atom pairs
could be scaled up by employing an array of single atom
tweezer traps as a starting point [40, 41].

Appendix A: Trajectory for merging two atoms into
one tweezer

The speed at which we choose to transport a Cs atom
in the 976 nm tweezer and subsequently merge it with
the 700 nm tweezer is constrained by two main factors:
(1) minimizing heating due to jerk (time-derivative of acceleration) at the endpoints, and (2) avoiding trap depth
oscillations at a frequency that could cause parametric
heating[42].
To address (1), we use the so-called “minimum-jerk
trajectory” [43] to transport Cs. It is designed to translate the equilibrium point of a classical harmonic oscillator with minimal motional excitation. The displacement
x as a function of time t is given by


where d is the total distance traveled and T is the total
move time.
However, the minimum jerk trajectory has a variable
moving speed that is problematic for constraint (2). Because the tweezer is transported by sweeping the RF frequency that drives the AOD in Fig. 1, the trap depth
oscillations arising from imperfections of the AOD (see
Section C) would sweep through a band of frequencies
and be more likely to excite a parametric heating resonance.
Therefore, we devise a hybrid trajectory which uses
constant velocity in the middle and minimum jerk at the
endpoints. Thus, the oscillation frequency is constant for
the middle part and the parameters can be more easily
chosen to avoid parametric resonances. The displacement
as a function of time for the hybrid trajectory is given by

and α = 0.95. We find the hybrid trajectory is more
robust against parametric heating.

Merge Time [ms]

Appendix B: Simulating merging of two tweezers

To find the fastest speed at which we can merge single Na and Cs atoms tweezers into the same tweezer,
we simulate their time evolution using the split operator
method [44].
The atomic polarizabilities are taken from Table 2 of
Ref. [45]. The initial and final trap eigenfunctions are calculated with the Fourier Grid method [46]. The ground
state population at the end of the sequence is given by the
squared overlap of the wavefunction following the time
evolution with the ground state of the final trap. The
accuracy of these simulations is determined by the time
step ∆t and position grid spacing ∆x. The accuracy of
the split operator method is then set by [T, V ]∆t2 , where
T and V are the kinetic and potential energy operators,
respectively. For the simulation data presented here, we
use a time step of ∆t = 0.1 µs and spatial grid spacing
∆x = 1 nm, and have checked that the results of the
simulation converge at these values.
The tweezer waist is estimated from scalar Gaussian
beam propagation simulation of the input beam (whose
waist we can measure), including the effect of the beam
clipping on the objective aperture. The simulated electric field intensities along the radial and axial directions
are fitted independently to those of a Gaussian beam.
We find that doing so gives an input beam that is Gaussian except that the Rayleigh range is scaled by 1.39, to
account for aberrations.
For the 976 nm tweezer, for 15 mW measured before a
final beam expanding telescope, 9 mm waist input before
the objective, the radial and axial waists at the tweezer
are 0.844 µm and 4.875 µm (zR = 1.006 µm) respectively.
We match the calculated and measured radial and axial
trapping frequencies of 125.7 kHz and 24.1 kHz respectively, by inserting a transmission coefficient T = 0.27 by
hand. This includes transmission through many optical
elements: dichroics, objective, glass cell, and electrode
plate surfaces. Similarly, for the 700 nm tweezer, 6.6 mm

the motional excitation as a function of merge time with fixed
trap depth.

input waist, 48 mW power before a final beam expanding
telescope, T= 0.36 gives 530.5 kHz and 92.7 kHz radial
and axial trap frequencies, in good agreement with measurements.
By scanning the merge time and calculating the final wavefunction overlap with the motional ground state
wavefunction, we find that we can scan more than 10×
faster (i.e. 2.95 µm in < 1 ms) using a minimum jerk trajectory and still remain in the ground state with > 99.9%
probability (see Fig 5), provided there are no technical
imperfections.
Appendix C: Derivation of trap depth oscillation
frequency

We use an IntraAction A2D-563AHF3.11 which can
deflect the beam in two dimensions. The electro-optic
medium is not angle-cut, and forms an acoustic cavity.
The amplitude of the intracavity field affects the AOD
diffraction efficiency and depends on RF drive frequency.
Therefore, as the RF drive frequency is scanned to move
the tweezer, the trap depth oscillates, in this case by 1%.
By scanning the tweezer position along the merge
axis and measuring the period of the intensity fringes,
we measure the free spectral range of the acoustic cavity to be F SR = 97.5 kHz. This is consistent with
F SR = v/2L where the length of the acousto-optic crystal L ≈ 2cm and the speed of sound is v = 3.63 mm/µs.
Scanning the RF drive frequency by 9.44 MHz moves
the 976 nm trap 2.95 µm in the focal plane.
Therefore, the acoustic cavity causes the trap depth
to oscillate at a frequency vmove 9.44 MHz /(F SR ×
2.95 µm), where vmove is the speed at which the trap

moves. For our hybrid trajectory in Section III, the
trap depth oscillation during the linear part is therefore
9.9kHz.

Appendix D: Simulated tweezer power 2D scan

We perform a numerical simulation of the dynamics of
merging atoms into one tweezer with different 700 nm
and 976 nm tweezer powers. This yields the plots in
Fig 6A and B for Na and Cs, respectively. We find that
heating regions arising from double-well for Na and antitrapping of Cs are qualitatively reproduced (discrepancy
in the exact size of the heating regions are attributed to
aberrations of the tweezers which cause the actual trap
depth to be different than expected).
We observe more overall heating in the experimental
data compared to simulation, even in the regions that
have no specific heating mechanism. This is likely caused
by axial misalignment, which we estimate to be about
1.5 µm in this experiment.

Appendix E: Calibration of Ω1 and Ω2

We use the vector light shift of the 1038 nm beam
on the Cs atom to calibrate the intensity. When the
beam power PP A = 20 mW, the vector light shift was
∆V LS = 2π × 35.7 kHz. We did PA to the c3 Σ+ (v ′ = 0)
and measured a PA rate of KP A = 1/0.35 ms.
The excited state lifetime is assumed to be Γe =
1/30.4 ns, the same as that of Cs 62 P3/2 .
√
Therefore Ω1 = Γe KP A = 2π × 49 kHz.

For the Raman transfer, we had a ∆V LS = 2π ×

The theoretical FCF’s yield Ω2 = 292 × Ω1 .
Appendix F: Using equal Raman beam powers

In the limits d2 >> d1 (the bound-bound transition is
much stronger than the free-bound transition) and ∆ >>
EB /~, the differential AC stark shift and scattering rate
are both proportional to (P1 + P2 )d22 .
1. Minimizing the number of photons scattered per
π−time. The time required for a coherent transfer to
occur is the so-called π-time tπ , where ΩR tπ = π. This
is given by
p
tπ = (2π∆)/( P1 P2 d1 d2 )
√
where di = Ωi / Pi is proportional to the matrix element for the transition addressed by Ωi .
Therefore, we want to minimize
p
(P1 + P2 )d2i /( P1 P2 d1 d2 )

which occurs when P1 = P2 .
2. Minimizing the decoherence due to fluctuating differential AC Stark shift. In the experiment, we assume
that the total Raman beam power stability is some fixed
fraction of the total power, dPtot ∝ Ptot = P1 + P2 .
Differential fluctuations of the Raman resonance must
be small compared to the spectral width of a coherent
Raman
transition, proportional to the Raman Rabi rate,
√
( P1 P2 d1 d2 )/(2∆). Therefore, we also want to minimize
p
(P1 + P2 )/( P1 P2 )
As before, this occurs when P1 = P2 .

Appendix G: Scattering rate of molecules due to
tweezer

We calculate the scattering rate from the least-bound
state v ′′ = 24 of the tweezer as a function of tweezer
frequency in Fig. 7. The calculation assumes a tweezer
beam power of 15 mW, and a beam waist of 0.8 µm,
and transmission through the objective and glass cell of
0.22. The calculation includes vibrational level v ′′ = 24
of the a3 Σ+ ground state and a complete basis of vibrational eigenstates derived from the c3 Σ+ excited state
molecular potentials which are embedded in an isotropic
harmonic well with a trap frequency of 80 kHz, which
is the geometric mean of the experiment axial and radial trapping frequencies. The dipole matrix elements
are assumed to be 3 e a0 times the relevant wavefunction
overlap.
