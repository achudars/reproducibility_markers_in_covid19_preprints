Abstract. The planar visible fold is a simple singularity in piecewise smooth
systems. In this paper, we consider singularly perturbed systems that limit
to this piecewise smooth bifurcation as the singular perturbation parameter
 ‚Üí 0. Alternatively, these singularly perturbed systems can be thought of as
regularizations of their piecewise counterparts. The main contribution of the
paper is to demonstrate the use of consecutive blowup transformations in this
setting, allowing us to obtain detailed information about a transition map near
the fold under very general assumptions. We apply this information to prove,
for the first time, the existence of a locally unique saddle-node bifurcation in
the case where a limit cycle, in the singular limit  ‚Üí 0, grazes the discontinuity
set. We apply this result to a mass-spring system on a moving belt described
by a Stribeck-type friction law.

1. Introduction
Piecewise smooth (PWS) differential equations appear in many applications, including problems in mechanics (impact, friction, backlash, free-play, gears, rocking
blocks), see also Section 2 below, electronics (switches and diodes, DC/DC converters, Œ£ ‚àí ‚àÜ modulators), control engineering (sliding mode control, digital control,
optimal control), oceanography (global circulation models), economics (duopolies)
and biology (genetic regulatory networks): see [8, 40] for further references. Much
of the mathematical study of PWS systems began with the work of Filippov [14]
and Utkin [50], the latter with a strong focus on applications in control theory.
However, PWS models do pose mathematical difficulties because they do not in
general define a (classical) dynamical system. In particular, forward uniqueness of
solutions cannot always be guaranteed; a prominent example of this is the two-fold
in R3 , see [7].
Frequently, PWS systems are idealisations of smooth systems with abrupt transitions. It is therefore perhaps natural to view a PWS system as a singular limit of
a smooth regularized system. This viewpoint has been adopted by many authors,
see e.g. [47, 6, 16, 38, 39, 22, 3, 26, 32, 31, 30], and is useful for resolving the ambiguities associated with PWS systems. In [32], for example, the authors showed that
the regularization of the visible-invisible two-fold in R3 , a PWS singularity producing a loss of uniqueness, possesses a forward orbit U that is distinguished amongst
all the possible forward orbits as  ‚Üí 0, see [32, Theorem 1] for details. Although
this result was only given for one particular regularization function (arctan), the
authors acknowledged that the results could be extended to other functions (including ones like those in (A1) and (A2) below) without essential changes to either their

result or their approach. To obtain this result, the authors applied an adaptation
of the blowup method, pioneered by Dumortier and Roussarie [9] to deal with fully
nonhyperbolic singularities.
On the other hand, the aim of [47], as one of the first papers on regularization,
was to develop a systematic study of PWS singularities and initiate the Peixoto‚Äôs
program about structural stability of PWS systems. In contrast, the present paper
is less about regularization and more about continuing a relative new program for
the analysis of smooth system that approach nonsmooth ones, as they appear in
applications, using blowup techniques in a framework known from from Geometric
Singular Perturbation Theory (GSPT) [33, 35, 23]. See [48, 25, 29, 19] for recent
research in this direction. By following this approach, we consider ‚Äì in a very
general framework ‚Äì smooth planar systems limiting as  ‚Üí 0 to PWS systems
having visible fold singularity. Using blowup, we obtain a detailed and uniform
description of a transition map near this fold. This allows us to prove, for the first
time, the existence of a locally unique saddle-node bifurcation in the case where a
family of limit cycles grazes the discontinuity set in a PWS visible fold.
1.1. Setting. We consider planar systems of the following form
zÃá = Z(z, œÜ(y‚àí1 , ), Œ±),

(1.1)

where z = (x, y) ‚àà R2 and œÜ : R √ó [0, 0 ] ‚Üí R. Moreover,  ‚àà (0, 0 ] and Œ± ‚àà I ‚äÇ R
are parameters and Z : R2 √ó R √ó I ‚Üí R2 is smooth in all arguments.
Specifically, we will assume that:
(A0) p 7‚Üí Z(z, p, Œ±) is affine:
Z(z, p, Œ±) = pZ+ (z, Œ±) + (1 ‚àí p)Z‚àí (z, Œ±),

(1.2)

with Z¬± : R2 √ó I ‚Üí R2 each smooth.
Regarding the functions œÜ we suppose the following:
(A1) œÜ : R √ó [0, 0 ] ‚Üí R is a smooth ‚Äúregularization function‚Äù satisfying:
œÜ0s (s, ) :=

‚àÇœÜ(s, )
> 0,
‚àÇs

(1.3)

for all s ‚àà R,  ‚àà [0, 0 ] and

œÜ(s, ) ‚Üí

1 for s ‚Üí ‚àû
,
0 for s ‚Üí ‚àí‚àû

(1.4)

for each  ‚àà [0, 0 ].
Assumptions (A0) and (A1), specifically (1.4), imply that the  ‚Üí 0 limit of (1.1)
is well-defined pointwise for y 6= 0, the limit being the PWS system:

Z+ (z, Œ±) for y > 0,
zÃá =
(1.5)
Z‚àí (z, Œ±) for y < 0.
In this sense, (1.1) is ‚Äúsingularly perturbed‚Äù, but obviously in a different way to
slow-fast systems where
xÃá = f (x, y, ),
yÃá = g(x, y, ),
for 0 <   1. Such systems have successfully been studied during the past decades
by GSPT. This theory provides a general framework or toolbox for dealing with
singular perturbations (in the dissipative setting) using invariant manifolds. It

consists of various theories and methods, most notably (a) Fenichel‚Äôs theory [11,
12, 13], see also [21, 35], for the perturbation of compact and normally hyperbolic
critical submanifolds of C = {(x, y)| f (x, y, 0) = 0} for  = 0, (b) the blowup
method [9, 33], for dealing with loss of hyperbolicity of C, and finally (c) the
Exchange Lemma [46].
Following (A0), see (1.5), systems of the form (1.1) can be viewed as regularizations of PWS systems. In this context, the regularization functions œÜ are always
assumed to be independent of , see [6, 16, 38, 39, 22, 3, 26, 32, 31, 30]. In this paper, we include this dependency in (A1) for full generality. This makes our results
directly applicable to switch-like functions that naturally appear in applications.
For example, the Goldbeter-Koshland function [15]:
‚àö
2 +  4 + s2 + 2  s2 + 4  s + 2 s2 + 2  +  s + 2 s
‚àö

.
(1.6)
œÜ(s, ) =
2 ‚àí s +  s + 4 + s2 + 2  s2 + 4  s + 2 s2 (1 + )
appears as a steady-state solution for a two-state biological system. It therefore
occurs naturally in QSS approximations and for  small ‚Äì which, in the biological
context, is given in terms of rate constants, ‚Äì it is switch-like. In fact, I have here
(without loss of generality) normalised the function appropriately such that (1.6)
satisfies (1.4). Notice that
œÜ(s, 0) =

2‚àís+

2
‚àö

s2 + 4

,

and with some extra work
(
s‚àí1
+ O(s‚àí2 ), for s ‚Üí ‚àû,
1 ‚àí 1+
œÜ(s, ) =
1+2
‚àí1
+ O((‚àís)‚àí2 ), for s ‚Üí ‚àí‚àû.
(1+)2 (‚àís)

(1.7)

(1.8)

Another reason for considering systems of the form (1.1), satisfying the general
condition (A1), is that such systems also appear upon certain normalization of
systems that are unbounded as  ‚Üí 0. I believe Peter Szmolyan [48] was the first
to promote this connection. For example, singular exponential nonlinearities like
‚àí1
ey with 0 <   1 appear in many different areas (see e.g. the Ebers-Moll
model of an NPN transistor [10] and the Arrhenius law in chemical kinetics [37]) of
mathematical modelling. Such terms, being unbounded for y > 0 and  ‚Üí 0, can be
‚Äútamed‚Äù by a normalization through division of the right hand side by a quantity
‚àí1
1 + ey . This corresponds to a nonlinear transformation of time and produces ‚Äì
under general assumptions ‚Äì systems of the form (1.1), satisfying (1.2), with œÜ of
the following form:
œÜ(s, ) =

es
.
1 + es

(1.9)

For further details, see the recent preprint [19].
On the other hand, the references [6, 38, 39, 3, 43], following [47], also study a
special class, called Sotomayor-Teixera regularization functions, consisting of nonanalytic functions œà(s) of the following form:
œà 0 (s) > 0,

for all

s ‚àà (‚àí1, 1),

4

K. ULDALL KRISTIANSEN

and
œà(s) = 0,

for all

s ‚â§ ‚àí1,

œà(s) = 1,

for all

s ‚â• 1.

(1.10)

Notice that these functions are not asymptotic to 0 and 1 but rather reach these
values at finite values of s. Simple analytic functions like 12 + œÄ1 arctan(s) or functions
like (1.6), see also (1.7), that appear in applications and satisfy (A1) do therefore
not belong to this class. In examples, see e.g. [3, 30], functions of the type (1.10)
are also always piecewise polynomial, the simplest example being (although this is
clearly only C 0 )
Ô£±
Ô£¥
for s ‚â• 1,
Ô£≤1
1
1
œà(s) = 2 s + 2 for s ‚àà (‚àí1, 1),
Ô£¥
Ô£≥
0
for s ‚â§ ‚àí1.
Since the Sotomayor-Teixera regularization functions do not satisfy (A1) and do
not appear naturally in applications, we shall not study these functions further in
the present paper.
1.2. PWS systems. Consider the PWS system (1.5). Along the discontinuity set
Œ£ = {(x, y)|y = 0}, also called the switching manifold in the PWS literature [8],
Z¬± can either (a) be pointing in the same directions, (b) be pointing in opposite
directions, or at least one of Z¬± is tangent. The subset Œ£cr along which (a) occurs
is called crossing, which is relatively ‚Äúharmless‚Äù. Here orbits of (1.1) follow the
orbits of (1.5) obtained by gluing orbits together on either side. The subset Œ£sl
along which (b) occurs, on the other hand, is called sliding. Here solutions of (1.5)
cannot be extended beyond the intersection with Œ£. In the PWS literature, (1.5)
is therefore frequently ‚Äúclosed‚Äù by subscribing a Filippov vector-field along Œ£. See
Fig. 1.2 for a geometric construction. Interestingly, under assumptions (A0) and
(A1), see [6, 38, 39, 3, 26, 32], the Filippov vector-field also coincides with a reduced
vector-field on a critical manifold of (1.1) for  = 0, obtained upon blowup of Œ£.
It is possible to characterize crossing and sliding using the Lie derivative Z+ h(¬∑) :=
‚àáh(¬∑) ¬∑ Z+ (¬∑, Œ±) of h(x, y) = y, such that Œ£ = {h(x, y) = 0}, along Z¬± :
Œ£cr = {q ‚àà Œ£|(Z+ h(q))(Z‚àí h(q)) > 0},
Œ£sl = {q ‚àà Œ£|(Z+ h(q))(Z‚àí h(q)) < 0}.
The tangencies
T = {q ‚àà Œ£|(Z+ h(q))(Z‚àí h(q)) = 0},
are in between.
1.3. The visible fold tangency. In [3], the authors also considered systems of
the form (1.1) satisfying (A0). In particular, they considered the local behaviour
near a visible fold tangency T , assuming that an orbit Œ≥ of Z+ had a quadratic
tangency with Œ£ at a point q ‚àà Œ£, while Z‚àí (q) was transverse to Œ£. See Fig. 2
for an illustration of the setting. Notice, the tangency is called visible because the
orbit Œ≥ is contained within y ‚â• 0. Using Lie derivatives, such a visible fold point
can be written as
Z+ h(q) = 0, Z+ (Z+ h)(q) > 0, Z‚àí h(q) > 0.

Figure 1. Geometric construction of the Filippov sliding vectorfield Zsl as the convex combination of Z¬± such that Zsl is tangent
to Œ£.
We consider the case illustrated in Fig. 2 where Œ£sl and Œ£cr occur at x < 0 and x >
0, respectively. Based on appropriate scalings, nonlinear transformations of time
and the flow-box theorem, the authors of [3] constructed a change of coordinates
such that near q, the system could be brought into the form (1.2) with


 
1 + f (z)

where f and g are smooth and where f (0) = 0 and q = (0, 0) in the new coordinates,
suppressing any dependency on a parameter Œ± in these expressions. The result is
local, so we assume z ‚àà UŒæ := [‚àíŒæ, Œæ]2 with Œæ > 0 sufficiently small. See [3,
Proposition 14]. Setting f = g = 0 in (1.11), we realize that the orbit Œ≥, which is
tangent to Œ£ at (x, y) = (0, 0), is close to the parabola y = x2 . In any case, it is
locally a graph y = Œ≥(x), x ‚àà I ‚äÇ [‚àíŒæ, Œæ], abusing notation slightly. It acts as a
separatrix: Everything within {(x, y) ‚àà UŒæ |x < 0, 0 < y < Œ≥(x)} reaches y = 0 and
‚Äúslides‚Äù, whereas everything above y = Œ≥(x) does not. See Fig. 2. In fact, on Œ£sl ,
a simple calculation shows that the Filippov vector-field gives
xÃá =

1 + f (x, 0)
,
1 ‚àí 2x

which is locally xÃá ‚â• c > 0 for c sufficiently small. This produces the local picture
in Fig. 2.
The authors of [3] analyse (1.1) with Z¬± as in (1.11) using asymptotic methods, but considered, following [47], the special class of non-analytic regularization
functions œà(s), recall (1.10). The authors described the perturbation of a critical
manifold and its extension by the forward flow into y > 0 as  ‚Üí 0 for this class of
functions. They also studied the case where a repelling limit cycle of Z+ grazes Œ£
and argued that this PWS bifurcation had to give rise to a saddle-node bifurcation
of limit cycles for   1. But they did not proof this latter statement nor did they
address the question of whether additional saddle-nodes could exist.

1.4. Main results. In this paper, we will, following [3, Proposition 14] and the
equations (1.11), revisit the results of [3] within our slightly more general framework. First, we provide a detailed description (not available in [3]) of a transition
mapping near the visible fold, see Theorem 1.3. Next, we use this accurate description to provide a rigorous proof of existence of a unique saddle-node bifurcation
in the situation, where the PWS system has a repelling limit cycles undergoing a
‚Äúgrazing bifurcation‚Äù, see Theorem 1.7.
In this paper, ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù will mean C l with l sufficiently large. We will leave it to
the reader to determine what ‚Äúsufficiently‚Äù is for the various statements to come.
The blowup approach for (1.1). Our approach to study systems of the form
(1.1) follows [32] and is very general. We consider the extended system
z 0 = Z(z, œÜ(y‚àí1 , ), Œ±),

(1.12)

0

 = 0,
with z = (x, y), obtained from (1.1) in terms of the ‚Äúfast time‚Äù: ()0 = (Àô). For
this system, the set defined by (x, y, 0) is a plane of equilibria, with the subset
given by y = 0 being extra singular due to the lack of smoothness there. However,
by the following final assumption (A2) on the regularization functions œÜ, we gain
smoothness by applying the blow-up transformation
(
y = ryÃÑ,
r ‚â• 0, (yÃÑ, ¬Ø) ‚àà S 1 7‚Üí
(1.13)
 = r¬Ø
,
for all x, to the extended system (1.12).
(A2) There exists ‚Äúdecay rates‚Äù k¬± ‚àà N, constants cj > 0, j = 0, . . . , 3 and
smooth functions œÜ¬± : [0, c0 ] √ó [0, c1 ] ‚Üí [c2 , c3 ] such that
k

œÜ(‚àí1
1 , r1 1 ) = 1 ‚àí 1 œÜ+ (1 , r1 ),

œÜ(‚àí‚àí1
3 , r3 3 ) =

k
3‚àí œÜ‚àí (3 , r3 ),

(1.14)
(1.15)

for all (i , ri ) ‚àà [0, c0 ] √ó [0, c1 ] and i = 1, 3.
Since  ‚â• 0, only ¬Ø ‚â• 0 is relevant. Geometrically, (1.13) therefore blows up the
line defined by (x, 0, 0) to a (semi-)cylinder, see also Fig. 6 below.
The variables (i , ri ), i = 1, 3 in (1.14) and (1.15) appear naturally from the
blowup approach. Indeed, following e.g. [33], we describe the blowup transformation in directional charts, obtained by setting yÃÑ = 1, ¬Ø = 1 and yÃÑ = ‚àí1, respectively.
This produces the following local forms
(
y = r1 ,
r1 ‚â• 0, 1 ‚â• 0 7‚Üí
(1.16)
 = r1 1 ,
(
y = r2 y2 ,
r2 ‚â• 0, y2 ‚àà R 7‚Üí
(1.17)
 = r2 ,
(
y = ‚àír3 ,
r3 ‚â• 0, 3 ‚àà R 7‚Üí
(1.18)
 = r3 3 ,
respectively, of (1.13). We will enumerate these three charts as (yÃÑ = 1)1 , (¬Ø
 = 1)2
and (yÃÑ = ‚àí1)3 , respectively, giving reference to how the charts are obtained and the
subscripts used. Hence (1 , r1 ) and (3 , r3 ) in (1.14) and (1.15) are local coordinates

THE REGULARIZED VISIBLE FOLD REVISITED

in (yÃÑ = 1)1 and (yÃÑ = ‚àí1)3 , respectively. The coordinate changes between the
different charts are obtained from the following equations:
(
r2 = r1 1 , y2 = ‚àí1
for 1 > 0,
1 ,
‚àí1
r2 = r3 3 , y2 = ‚àí3 , for 3 > 0.
In contrast to the usual blowup approach [9, 33], we will not divide by r to obtain improved properties. Instead, we gain hyperbolicity and recover the piecewise
smooth systems by dividing by common factors i , i = 1, 3, in the charts (yÃÑ = 1)1
and (yÃÑ = ‚àí1)3 , respectively. This is carefully described in [32], see also Appendix A;
notice e.g. Remark A.1.
Under assumption (A2), we also have that the perturbation for y 6= 0 is regular:
Lemma 1.1. Consider (A0), (A1) and (A2). Fix any (small) constant c > 0
and consider (1.1) within the set defined by |y| ‚â• c > 0. This system is a regular
perturbation of the PWS system (1.5) for  = 0.
Proof. Consider y ‚â• c. The case y ‚â§ ‚àíc is identical and therefore left out. Then
by (A0), (A2) and (1.16) we can write (1.1) as

zÃá = 1 ‚àí (y ‚àí1 )k œÜ+ (y ‚àí1 , y) Z+ (z, Œ±) + (y ‚àí1 )k œÜ+ (y ‚àí1 , y)Z‚àí (z, Œ±),
which within y ‚â• c is a smooth perturbation of zÃá = Z+ (z, Œ±), the perturbation
being of O(k ), uniformly for y ‚â• c, as  ‚Üí 0.

Remark 1.2. Following (1.8), we may realise that (1.6) satisfies (A2) with k¬± = 1
and
œÜ+ (0, 0) = œÜ‚àí (0, 0) = 1.
In later computations, we will use the following regularization function


s

œÜ(s, ) =
1+ ‚àö

s2 + 1
for which
p

2 1 + 1

(1.19)

and œÜ‚àí (3 , r3 3 ) = œÜ+ (3 , r3 3 ). Hence k¬± = 2 for (1.19). Functions like (1.9)
and tanh, where k¬± = ‚àû and hence excluded by (A2), are more difficult, because
the blowup method has to be adapted to deal with the non-algebraic terms, see [26].
This is also the subject of the recent paper [19].
A local transition map. In the following, we state our first main result. Let Œ¥ ‚àà
(0, Œæ) and consider two sections Œ£L and Œ£R transverse to Z+ within y = Œ¥ ‚àà (0, Œæ)
such that points in Œ£L flow to points in Œ£R in finite time by following the flow of
Z+ . Specifically, we take
Œ£L = {(x, y)|y = Œ¥, x ‚àà IL ‚äÇ (‚àíŒæ, 0)},

(1.20)

Œ£R = {(x, y)|y = Œ¥, x ‚àà IR ‚äÇ (0, Œæ)},

(1.21)

where IL and IR are closed intervals. By adjusting Œ¥, Œæ, IL and IR , if necessary, we
may assume that Œ≥ intersects Œ£L and Œ£R in their interior and that the x-values of
the intersection, Œ≥L and Œ≥R , respectively, satisfy Œ≥L < 0 < Œ≥R . See Fig. 2. Then we
define Q(¬∑, ) as the transition map (of Dulac type) IL 3 x 7‚Üí Q(x, ) ‚àà IR obtained

at (x, y) = (0, 0) while Z‚àí (0, 0) is transverse. Along the sliding
region, Œ£sl = {x < 0}, the Filippov vector-field gives xÃá > 0. Every
point in Œ£L with x < Œ≥L therefore reaches Œ£R at x = Œ≥R by
following the Filippov flow. See also Remark 1.5.
by the first intersection (Q(x, ), Œ¥) ‚àà Œ£R of the forward flow, defined by (1.2), with
Z¬± as in (1.11), of the point (x, Œ¥) ‚àà Œ£L . Since k‚àí plays little role, recall (A2), we
set
k = k+ ,
for simplicity in the following.
Theorem 1.3. Consider (1.1), satisfying (A0), specifically (1.2) with (1.11), and
suppose (A1)-(A2).
(a) [6, 38, 39, 32] Fix any 0 < ŒΩ < Œæ and let J = [‚àíŒæ, ‚àíŒΩ]. Then there exists an
0 > 0 such that for any  ‚àà (0, 0 ), there exists a locally invariant manifold
S as a graph over J:
S : y = h(x, ), x ‚àà J,
where h is smooth in both variables. The manifold has an invariant Lipschitz foliation of stable fibers along which orbits contract exponentially towards S . For  = 0 these fibers coincide with the orbits of Z¬± reaching
Œ£ ‚à© {x ‚àà J} after a finite time. Moreover, Z|S is a regular perturbation of
the Filippov vector-field.
(b) The forward flow of S intersects Œ£R in (m(), Œ¥) where
m() = Œ≥R + 2k/(2k+1) m1 (),

(1.22)

with m1 continuous.
(c) Fix Œ∏ > 0 so small that 0 < Œ∏ ‚àí Œ≥L < Œæ and let K = [‚àíŒæ, Œ≥L ‚àí Œ∏] ‚äÇ IL .
Consider QK (¬∑, ) = Q(¬∑, )|K : K ‚Üí IR . Then QK is a strong contraction:
QK (x, ) = m() + O(e‚àíc/ ),

‚àÇx QK (x, ) = O(e‚àíc/ ).

(d) Fix œÖ ‚àà (‚àí1, 0). Then for any c > 0 sufficiently small, there exist positive
numbers 0 , Œ¥, Œæ, œá and intervals IL and IR such that the following holds
for all 0 <  ‚â§ 0 .
(i) |Q0x (x, )| ‚â§ c for all x ‚àà IL ‚à© {x ‚â§ Œ≥L ‚àí œá2k/(2k+1) }.
(ii) Q0x (x, ) < 0, Q00xx (x, ) < 0 for all x ‚àà ILC := IL ‚à© {|x ‚àí Œ≥L | ‚â§
œá2k/(2k+1) }. In particular, there exists a unique x ‚àà ILC such Q0x (x, ) =
œÖ for which
Q00xx (x, ) ‚â§ ‚àíc‚àí1 .

(1.23)

(iii) 1 ‚àí c ‚â§ |Q0x (x, )| ‚â§ 1 + c for all x ‚àà IL ‚à© {x ‚â• Œ≥L + œá2k/(2k+1) }.
Remark 1.4. As highlighted, Theorem 1.3 (a) is known from many references, see
e.g. [6, 38, 39], in related and even more general contexts. Notice that the existence of the invariant manifold follows directly by inserting the scaling y = y2 .
In terms of (x, y2 ) the system is slow-fast such that Fenichel‚Äôs theory [11, 12, 13]
applies, see also (A.1) in Appendix A. This produces S as a slow manifold, having
a smooth foliation of stable fibers within compact subsets of the (x, y2 )-system. For
the Sotomayor-Teixera regularization functions, where one can restrict the (x, y2 )system to a compact strip y2 ‚àà [‚àí1, 1], recall (1.10), this produces Theorem 1.3(a).
For the ‚Äúasymptotic‚Äù regularization functions used in the present paper, the properties of the stable foliation is slightly more technical. For this reason, and for the
sake of readability and completeness, we have decided to include (a) in the main
theorem.
More specifically, we emphasize that the results in [3, Theorem 2.1], valid for
the Sotomayor-Teixera regularization functions (1.10), are similar to (a), (b) and
(c). Notice, however, that the remainder of m() in the setting of [3] is O()
(whereas it is O(2k/(2k+1) ) in (1.22)). Nevertheless, the details of the mapping
Q in Theorem 1.3 (d), covering a full neighborhood of Œ≥L , is not available in [3].
It is this detailed information that we will use in the following to prove rigorous
statements about the grazing bifurcation.
Remark 1.5. Notice, it is possible to obtain a ‚Äúsingular‚Äù map Q0 : Œ£L ‚Üí Œ£R of
the PWS Filippov system. This mapping is only continuous being of the following
form
(i) Q00 (x) = 0 for all x < Œ≥L ;
(ii) Q00 not defined for x = Œ≥L ;
(iii) 1 ‚àí c ‚â§ |Q00 (x)| ‚â§ 1 + c for all x > Œ≥L .
This holds for any c > 0 provided that Œ¥ and IL are appropriately adjusted. Compare
with Theorem 1.3(d). (i) is due to the fact that every point in IL with x < Œ≥L reaches
the sliding segment, see Fig. 2. Hence:
Q0 (x) = Œ≥R ,
for all x < Œ≥L .

Application to a grazing bifurcation. To present our second main result, we
now assume the following:
(B1) Suppose that Z+ has a hyperbolic and repelling limit cycle Œì0 for Œ± = 0
with a unique quadratic tangency with Œ£ = {y = 0} at the point q = (0, 0).
Since Œì0 is hyperbolic there exists a local family {ŒìŒ± }Œ±‚ààI , where
I = (‚àía, a),

a > 0,

(1.24)

of hyperbolic and repelling limit cycles of Z+ .
(B2) Let Y (Œ±) = min y(t) along ŒìŒ± so that Y (0) = 0 by assumption (B1).
Suppose that
Y 0 (0) > 0.
By (B1) and (B2) and the implicit function theorem, ŒìŒ± therefore, for a > 0
sufficiently small, recall (1.24), intersects {y = 0} only for Œ± ‚â§ 0, doing so twice for
Œ± < 0 and once for Œ± = 0. Finally:
(B3) Suppose that Z‚àí has a positive y-component at (x, y) = (0, 0) for Œ± = 0,
i.e. Z‚àí f (0, 0) > 0.
We illustrate the setting in Fig. 3. As a consequence of (B1) and (B3), and the
implicit function theorem, the PWS system (Z‚àí , Z+ ) has a visible fold near (x, y) =
(0, 0) for all Œ± ‚àà I (after possibly restricting a > 0 further). In fact, also by the
implicit function theorem, the x-value of this fold point depends smoothly on Œ±
and we can therefore shift it to (x, y) = (0, 0) for all Œ±. Moreover by (A3), we can
apply the result of [3] and bring the PWS system into the form (1.11) near the
fold. We will now study the bifurcation of limit cycles that occur for (1.2) near
Œ± = 0 for all 0 <   1. (In the PWS setting, this bifurcation is known as the
grazing bifurcation, see e.g. [36, Fig. 14, section 4.11].) For this we study the
PoincareÃÅ map (of Dulac type) P (¬∑, Œ±, ) : IL ‚Üí IL obtained by the forward flow.
This mapping is well-defined by the assumptions (B1)-(B3) and by Theorem 1.3,
based on assumptions (A1)-(A2). We compose P (¬∑, Œ±, ) into two parts: The ‚Äúlocal‚Äù
mapping Q(¬∑, Œ±, ) : IL ‚Üí IR , studied in Theorem 1.3, and a ‚Äúglobal‚Äù mapping
R(¬∑, Œ±, ) : IR ‚Üí IL :
P (x, Œ±, ) = R(Q(x, Œ±, ), , Œ±).

(1.25)

By (A2), recall Lemma 1.1, x 7‚Üí R(x, Œ±, ) is a regular perturbation of the associated
mapping x 7‚Üí R(x, 0, Œ±) obtain from the Z+ system.
Lemma 1.6. Assume (B1) and (B2). The mapping R is smooth in all of its
arguments. Also there exists a œâ > 0 such that upon decreasing Œæ and Œ¥, if necessary,
the map satisfies:
R(Œ≥R , 0, 0) = Œ≥L ,
Rx0 (Œ≥R , 0, 0)
0
RŒ±
(Œ≥R , 0, 0)

(1.26)

< ‚àí1 ‚àí œâ,

(1.27)

> œâ.

(1.28)

Proof. (1.26) holds by assumption (B1) and the definition of Œ≥L and Œ≥R . By (B1),
Œì0 is a hyperbolic but repelling limit cycle of Z+ . Therefore Px0 (Œ≥R , 0, 0) > 1, as
a mapping obtained from Z+ at  = 0 only, and hence by decomposing P into R
e : Œ£L ‚Üí Œ£R , say, we obtain, upon restricting Œæ and Œ¥, that ‚àíQ
e
and a local map Q
is as close to the identity as desired. Indeed, as a mapping obtained from the flow

(B1) is so that Œì0 is repelling for Z+ for Œ± = 0. By (B2), ŒìŒ±<0

Before stating our theorem on the grazing bifurcation, we recall that a saddlenode bifurcation of a periodic orbit is a saddle-node bifurcation of a fix-point of the
PoincareÃÅ map P (¬∑, Œ±, ), see [45, Theorem 1, p. 369]. By (1.25), we can write the
fix-point equation P (x, Œ±, ) = x as follows:
Q(x, Œ±, ) = R‚àí1 (x, Œ±, ),

(1.29)

where R‚àí1 (¬∑, Œ±, ) : IR ‚Üí IL is the inverse of R(¬∑, Œ±, ). The saddle-node bifurcation
we will describe will be unfolded by the parameter Œ±. Using (1.29), it is then
straightforward to show that the conditions

periodic orbit as the ‚Äúsaddle-node periodic orbit‚Äù.

We also recall the definition of the Hausdorff distance between two non-empty
compact subsets X and Y :


distHausdorff (X, Y ) = max sup inf d(x, y), sup inf d(x, y) .
x‚ààX y‚ààY

y‚ààY x‚ààX

Here d(x, y) is the distance between two points x, y ‚àà R2 . distHausdorff turns the
set of non-empty compact subsets into its own metric space [41].
We now have.
Theorem 1.7. Suppose (A0)-(A2) and (B1)-(B3). Then there exists a locally
unique saddle-node bifurcation of limit cycles for all 0 <   1 at
Œ± = 2k/(2k+1) Œ±2 (),

(1.33)

with Œ±2 continuous, such that limit cycles only exist within Œ± ‚àà I for
Œ± ‚â§ 2k/(2k+1) Œ±2 (),
two for Œ± < 2k/(2k+1) Œ±2 () and precisely one for
Œ± = 2k/(2k+1) Œ±2 ().
The saddle-node periodic orbit for Œ± = 2k/(2k+1) Œ±2 () converges in Hausdorff distance to the grazing limit cycle Œì0 of Z+ as  ‚Üí 0.
Remark 1.8. The grazing bifurcation for the discontinuity system has been studied
by many authors, also in cases where the codimension of Œ£ is greater than one,
see e.g. [8] and references therein. In this context, the grazing bifurcation (in [8]:
the grazing-sliding bifurcation) can be studied using formal normal forms of discontinuous return mappings, analogously to Q0 in Remark 1.5, see e.g. [8, Theorem
8.3 and section 8.5.3]. [8] also describes ‚Äì using these normal forms and results on
border collision bifurcations for PWS maps, see e.g. [8, Theorem 3.4] ‚Äì how the
grazing bifurcation in higher dimensions can lead to emergence of a chaotic attractor. The saddle-node, described in Theorem 1.7 for the smooth system (1.1), is in
the discontinuous case called a ‚Äúnon-smooth fold‚Äù in [8].
1.5. Overview. In Section 2 we present an example where Theorem 1.7 can be
applied and provide some numerical comparisons. We prove Theorem 1.3 in Section 3. Given the blowup transformation defined by (1.13), the proof will rest upon
another blowup of a nonhyperbolic point T ‚Äì being the imprint of the PWS visible fold ‚Äì which we describe in the chart (yÃÑ = 1)1 . Then, upon undertaking a
careful blowup analysis, see Section 3.1, Section 3.2 and Section 3.3, we combine
the findings in Section 3.4 and Section 3.5 to prove Theorem 1.3 (b), (c) and (d),
respectively. Theorem 1.3 (a), being standard, is moved to the Appendix A. Theorem 1.7 is proven in Section 4 using the implicit function theorem and the details
of the local transition map described in Theorem 1.3(d). We conclude the paper
in Section 5. Here we discuss the assumptions, the regularization functions used,
possible extensions to our work and compare our results with [3].
2. The friction oscillator
Systems of the form (1.1) often appear in models of friction. Consider for example
the system in Fig. 4(a), where a mass-spring system is on a moving belt. This

THE REGULARIZED VISIBLE FOLD REVISITED

produces the following equations
xÃá = y ‚àí Œ±,

(2.1)
‚àí1

yÃá = ‚àíx ‚àí ¬µ(y, œÜ(y

, )),

where Œ± > 0 is the belt speed, x is the elongation of the spring and y is the velocity
relative to the belt, all in nondimensional form. Furthermore, ¬µ is the friction force
opposing the relative velocity, i.e. ¬µ > 0 for y > 0 and ¬µ < 0 for y < 0. Many
different forms of ¬µ exists, often PWS, but we will suppose that
¬µ(y, p) = ¬µ+ (y)p ‚àí ¬µ+ (‚àíy)(1 ‚àí p),

(2.2)

as desired, such that ¬µ is ‚Äúodd‚Äù with respect to (y, p) 7‚Üí (‚àíy, 1 ‚àí p). Here ¬µ+ (y) is
a smooth function having a minimum at y = y0 > 0, see Fig. 4(b), such that
¬µ0+ (y0 ) = 0, ¬µ00+ (y0 ) > 0,

(2.3)

and ¬µ0+ (y) < 0 for all y ‚àà [0, y0 ) while ¬µ0+ (y) > 0 for all y ‚àà (y0 , ‚àû). The resulting
shape of ¬µ+ is shown in Fig. 4(b); the initial negative slope is known as the Stribeck
effect of friction, see e.g. [1]. In this way, we obtain the following associated PWS
system

‚àíx + ¬µ+ (‚àíy)
The system (2.2) with p = œÜ(y/, ), œÜ satisfying (A1)-(A2), can viewed as a regularization of the PWS model (Z+ , Z‚àí ), given by (2.4), with the PWS friction
law
(
¬µ+ (y)
for y > 0,
¬µ(y) =
‚àí¬µ+ (‚àíy) for y < 0.
Consider now Z+ . By (2.3), this system clearly has a Hopf bifurcation for Œ± =
y0 at (x, y) = (‚àí¬µ+ (y0 ), y0 ). A straightforward calculation also shows that the
Lyapunov coefficient is proportional to ¬µ000
+ (y0 ); the bifurcation being subcritical
000
(supercritical) for ¬µ000
+ (y0 ) < 0 (¬µ+ (y0 ) > 0, respectively). Suppose the former.
Then for y0 sufficiently small, it follows that the unstable Hopf limit cycles of Z+
for  = 0 intersect the switching manifold y = 0 in the way described in (B1)-(B2)
for some value of Œ± = Œ±‚àó > y0 near y0 . The fact that Œ±‚àó > y0 is due to the fact
that the local Hopf limit cycles are repelling. Furthermore, the visible fold tangency
with y = 0 for Œ± = Œ±‚àó occurs at the point q : (x, y) = (‚àí¬µ+ (0), 0). To verify (B3),
notice by (2.4) that yÃá = 2¬µ+ (0) > 0 at q from below. As a result, assuming (A1)(A2), there exists saddle-node bifurcation of limit cycles near Œ± = Œ±‚àó for   1, see
Theorem 1.7. We collect the result in the following corollary.
Corollary 2.1. Consider (2.1) with ¬µ of the form (2.2), where there exists an
y0 > 0 such that (2.3) holds and suppose that the regularization function œÜ satisfies
(A1)-(A2). Suppose also that ¬µ000
+ (y0 ) < 0. Then for y0 sufficiently small there
exists an 0 > 0 such that for every  ‚àà (0, 0 ) the following holds:
(1) There exists a subcritical Hopf bifurcation at Œ±H () = y0 + O().
(2) The unstable Hopf limit cycles undergo a locally unique saddle-node bifurcation at Œ±SN () = Œ±‚àó + 2k/(2k+1) Œ±2 () > Œ±H (), Œ±‚àó > y0 being the value
for which a Hopf cycle of Z+ grazes Œ£.

14

K. ULDALL KRISTIANSEN

(3) For any Œ± ‚àà (Œ±H (), Œ±SN ()) two (and, locally, only two) limit cycles exist:
Œìsl (Œ±, ) and Œì+ (Œ±, ), where:
‚Ä¢ Œìsl is hyperbolic and attracting.
‚Ä¢ lim‚Üí0 Œìsl (Œ±, ) has a sliding segment.
‚Ä¢ Œì+ is hyperbolic and repelling.
‚Ä¢ lim‚Üí0 Œì+ (Œ±, ) is a limit cycle of Z+ contained within y > 0.
No limit cycles exist near (x, y) = (‚àí¬µ+ (y0 ), y0 ) for Œ± > Œ±SN ().
(4) Let ŒìSN () be the saddle-node periodic orbit for Œ± = Œ±SN (). Then ŒìSN ()
converges in Hausdorff-distance to the repelling limit cycle of Z+ which
grazes y = 0 for Œ± = Œ±‚àó .
Proof. (1) and (2) follows from the analysis preceding the corollary. (3) and (4) are
also consequences of the proof of Theorem 1.7, recall also Remark 1.5.


Remark 2.2. Corollary 2.1 applies to all friction models of the type shown in
Fig. 4(b), satisfying ¬µ000
+ (y0 ) < 0, and to the general regularization functions satisfying (A1)-(A2). This shows that the saddle-node bifurcation in the friction oscillator
problem is a very ‚Äúrobust phenomena‚Äù. In fact, the details that depend upon the
regularization function (like k) are ‚Äúmicroscopic‚Äù (i.e. hidden in remainder terms
o(1)). We discuss the friction oscillator problem further in the final paragraph of
Section 5.
It is known from experiments that subcritical Hopf bifurcations do occur for
certain friction characteristics, see e.g. [17]. Explicitly, they occur for the model
¬µ+ (y) = ¬µm + (¬µs ‚àí ¬µm )e‚àíœÅy + cy,

(2.5)

proposed in [1] and also studied in [51, 44], which we will now use in numerical
computations. For (2.5), ¬µ+ (0) = ¬µs and ¬µs > ¬µm > 0, œÅ > 0, and c ‚àà (0, œÅ(¬µs ‚àí
¬µm )) for the Stribeck effect and the existence of y0 to be present. In fact, for (2.5),
y0 = ‚àíœÅ‚àí1 log (c/(œÅ(¬µs ‚àí ¬µm ))) ,

¬µ00+ (y0 ) = œÅc > 0,

2
¬µ000
+ (y0 ) = ‚àíœÅ c < 0.

In Fig. 5, we illustrate numerical results, obtained using AUTO, for (2.5) with
the following parameters:
¬µs = 1, ¬µm = 0.5, œÅ = 4, c = 0.85,
such that y0 ‚âà 0.33. In Fig. 5, we have also used the regularization function (1.19)
for which k = k¬± = 2 in (A2), and varied the small parameter . In Fig. 5(a), for
example, a bifurcation diagram is shown using min y as a measure of the amplitude,
with  varying along the different branches, highlighted in different colours. The
Hopf bifurcation occurs at Œ± ‚âà y0 with min y decreasing from around that same
value (not visible in the zoomed version of the diagram in (a)). However, along each
branch, a saddle-node bifurcation is visible. In black dashed lines is the unperturbed
bifurcation diagram for Z+ . Numerically, we therefore see that the saddle-node
bifurcation approaches the singular limit, in agreement with Theorem 1.7. See
further details in the figure caption. In Fig. 5(d), we show the value of Œ±‚àó ‚àí Œ±
along the saddle-node bifurcation for varying values of  using a loglog-scale. Here
Œ±‚àó ‚âà 0.4 is the unperturbed value of the bifurcation, where the limit cycle of Z+
grazes the discontinuity set. The slope of the curve is almost constant; using least

square we obtain a slope ‚âà 0.8024 which is also in agreement with Theorem 1.7 for
k = 2; notice 2k/(2k+1) = 4/5 = 0.8 for this value of k.
In Fig. 5(c), the nonhyperbolic saddle-node periodic orbits are shown for different
values of . The dashed black curve (barely visible, but it has the largest amplitude)
shows the grazing limit cycle for Z+ at Œ± = Œ±‚àó ‚âà 0.4. Finally, Fig. 5(d) shows two
co-existing limit cycles for Œ± = 0.38 and  = 5 √ó 10‚àí4 in red. For comparison, the
bifurcating limit cycle at this -value and Œ± = 0.398 is shown using a red dashed
line.
3. Proof of Theorem 1.3
In this section, we will prove Theorem 1.3. First, we work with the blowup
(1.13). The analysis of this blowup system is standard and the details can be found
in different formulations, also for more general systems. See e.g. [6, 38, 32]. We
therefore delay the details to Appendix A and instead just summarise the findings
(see also Fig. 6 for an illustration): Using the chart (¬Ø
 = 1)2 , recall (1.17), we
find a critical manifold S on the cylinder as a graph over Œ£sl . It is noncompact
in the scaling chart (¬Ø
 = 1)2 , but using (yÃÑ = 1)1 we find that it ends on the edge
yÃÑ = 1 (yellow in Fig. 6) in a nonhyperbolic point T : x = 0, (yÃÑ, ¬Ø) = (1, 0). This
point (in brown) is the imprint of the tangency T (also in brown on the blown
down picture on the left) on the blown-up system. Away from x = 0 the edge
yÃÑ = 1 is hyperbolic, whereas yÃÑ = ‚àí1 (purple in Fig. 6) is hyperbolic for all x. The
latter property follows from working in (yÃÑ = ‚àí1)3 . Next, by working in (¬Ø
 = 1)2 ,
we obtain the invariant manifold S using Fenichel‚Äôs theory [13] upon restricting
S to the compact set x ‚àà J. The invariant foliation in Theorem 1.3 (a) is also a
consequence of Fenichel‚Äôs theory. However, Fenichel‚Äôs foliation is only local to S
on the cylinder. To extend it beyond the cylinder into y 6= 0 uniformly in  we
work near the hyperbolic lines (yÃÑ, ¬Ø) = (¬±1, 0), x < 0 in the charts (yÃÑ = ¬±1)1,3 ,
respectively. See further details in Appendix A. Combining the information proves
Theorem 1.3 (a).
Remark 3.1. In Fig. 6 and the figures that follow we indicate hyperbolic directions
by tripple-headed arrows, whereas slow and center directions are indicated by singleheaded arrows.

In (c): the saddle-node periodic orbits. The dashed magenta and
cyan curves are nullclines for Z+ at the unperturbed bifurcation
parameter Œ± = 0.4. The colours are identical to (a). In (d), for
 = 5 √ó 10‚àí3 , two limit cycles are shown for Œ± = 0.38. The inner
most is repelling while the other one, having a segment near the
sliding region, is stable. The black curves are transients while
the dashed magenta and cyan curves are nullclines as in (b). For
comparison, the saddle-node periodic orbit (red and dashed) is
shown for the same -value.

To prove the remaining claims of the theorem, we work in chart (yÃÑ = 1)1 with
the coordinates (r1 , x, 1 ) and the local blowup (1.16). In these coordinates, we
then blowup the nonhyperbolic point T to a sphere. Using three directional charts,

The blown down version is on the left whereas the blowup picture

of the diagram. Since  ‚â• 0 only the part of the cylinder with
¬Ø ‚â• 0 is relevant. Through desingularization we smoothness and
hyperbolicity along the edges yÃÑ = ¬±1 (yellow and purple), except
at the point T at x = 0 which is fully nonhyperbolic. On the side of
the cylinder, which can be described in the scaling chart (¬Ø
 = 1)2 ,
we find a normally hyperbolic critical manifold S. By working in
(yÃÑ = 1)1 , we realise that it ends in the fully nonhyperbolic point
T . Here S is tangent to a nonhyperbolic critical fiber at x = 0.

we describe the dynamics on this sphere, see details in Section 3.2 and Section 3.3.
This analysis is the basis of the subsequent proof of Theorem 1.3(b),(c) and (d),
see Section 3.4 and Section 3.5, respectively.

equations:

xÃá = r(1 ‚àí  œÜ+ (r, ))(1 + f (x, r)),

by inserting (1.16) into (1.12) with Z¬± given by (1.11) and dividing the resulting right hand side by the common factor 1 (as promised in our description of
the blowup approach, see Section 1.4). For simplicity, we have also dropped the
subscripts on r1 and 1 in (3.1). Furthermore, in (3.1),
F (r, x, ) = (1 ‚àí k œÜ+ (r, ))(2x + rg(x, r)) + k œÜ+ (r, ),
where we have used (A2) and set k+ = k. This system is described in further details
in Appendix A (for x < 0).

Clearly, (r, x, ) = (0, 0, 0), corresponding to T , is fully nonhyperbolic for (3.1),

Let X denote the right hand side in (3.1). Then the exponents (or weights) 2k,

This is the general idea of blowup, see e.g. [9].
Remark 3.2. Notice that the weights in the expressions for x and  in (3.2) are so
that on the cylinder {r = 0}, the kth-order tangency between the critical manifold,
of the form x = k1 m(1 ) in chart (yÃÑ = 1)1 , and the nonhyperbolic critical fiber,
at x = 1 = 0, gets geometrically separated on the blowup sphere. Similarly, the
weights on x and y = r are so that the quadratic tangency within { = 0}, due to
the visible fold, also gets separated.
We will use three local charts, obtained by setting

We will frequently use these coordinate changes without further reference. We
illustrate the blowup in Fig. 7, using a similar viewpoint as in Fig. 6. We analyse
each of the charts in the following. In Section 3.4, we combine the results into a
proof of Theorem 1.3 (b) and (c).

Figure 7. Illustration of the subsequent blowup (3.2) of the nonhyperbolic point (r1 , x1 , 1 ) = (0, 0, 0), corresponding to T , in the
chart (yÃÑ = 1)1 . The weights in (3.2) are so that the critical manifold and the nonhyperbolic fiber gets separated into two poins
pa and pf on the sphere (in brown in the blowup picture on the
right). By desingularization, these points have improved hyperbolicity properties, as indicated by the tripple-headed arrows. Similarly, the blowup also separates the quadratic tangency within
 = 0 into two points pL and pR on the sphere, which also have
improved hyperbolicity properties after desingularization (in fact
both are fully hyperbolic). See Lemma 3.3 and Lemma 3.9 for
further details.

pL and pR are hyperbolic and we use partial, smooth linearizations,
see Lemma 3.4 and Lemma 3.5, near this points to describe the
local transition maps between the various sections shown. Notice
œÅ1 = 0 corresponds to the sphere, obtained from the blowup of T ,
which is (also) brown in Fig. 7.

Therefore x1 = ‚àì1 are equilibria of this reduced system, x1 = ‚àí1 being hyperbolic
and repelling, x1 = 1 being hyperbolic and attracting. They correspond to the
intersection of Œ≥ with the blowup sphere, see Fig. 7.
Lemma 3.3. The points pL , pR : (œÅ1 , x1 , 1 ) = (0, ‚àì1, 0), respectively, are hyperbolic. In particular, the eigenvalues of pL and pR are as follows:

Moreover, the 2-dimensional Wloc
(pL ) is a neighborhood of x1 = ‚àí1, 1 = 0 within
œÅ1 = 0 whereas the 1-dimensional W s (pL ) ‚Äì corresponding to Œ≥ for x < 0,  = 0
upon blowing down ‚Äì is tangent to the vector (1, 0, 0). On the other hand, the 2s
(pR ) is a full neighborhood of x1 = 1, 1 = 0 within œÅ1 = 0 whereas
dimensional Wloc
the 1-dimensional W u (pR ) ‚Äì corresponding to Œ≥ for x > 0,  = 0 upon blowing down

See Fig. 8 for an illustration, compare also with the sphere on the right in Fig. 7.

and hence we cannot (directly, at least) perform a smooth linearization near these
points. However, near pL and pR we have F1 ‚âà ‚àì2, respectively, and we can
therefore divide the right hand side of the equations by ‚àí 12 F1 and 12 F1 , respectively,

g2 (œÅk2 , r2 , x2 ) = g(œÅk2 x2 , œÅ2k
2 r2 ).

Along the invariant set œÅ2 = r2 = 0, we have
xÃá2 = kx2 (2x2 + œÜ+ (0, 0)) ,
so that x2 = 0 and x2 = ‚àí 21 œÜ+ (0, 0) are equilibria, the former being repelling
while the latter is attracting. Linearization of the full system about these equilibria
produces the following lemma by standard theory [45].
Lemma 3.9. We have

(1) The point pa : (œÅ2 , r2 , x2 ) = 0, 0, ‚àí 12 œÜ+ (0, 0) is partially hyperbolic, the
linearization having only one single non-zero eigenvalue Œª = ‚àíkœÜ+ (0, 0) <
0. As a consequence there exists a center manifold M1 of pa which contains
S1 within r2 = 0 as a manifold of equilibria and a unique center manifold within œÅ2 = 0, along which r2 is increasing, which is tangent to the
eigenvector (0, kœÜ+ , 1)T . The equilibrium pa is therefore a nonhyperbolic
saddle.
(2) The point pf : (œÅ2 , r2 , x2 ) = (0, 0, 0) is fully hyperbolic, the linearization
having two positive eigenvalues and one negative. The stable manifold is
u
r2 = x2 = 0, œÅ2 ‚â• 0 whereas Wloc
is a neighborhood of (r2 , x2 ) = (0, 0)
within œÅ2 = 0.

3.4. Proof of Theorem 1.3(b) and (c). In chart (¬Ø
 = 1)2 , the set defined by
the following equation
œÅ2k+1
r22k = ,
2

(3.28)

where  is the original small parameter, is invariant. This follows from (3.4) and
(1.16). Therefore if we fix  > 0 sufficiently small and restrict to the set defined
by (3.28), the local center manifold M1 in Lemma 3.9 provides an extension of the
invariant manifold S up to r2 = œÖ, œÖ a small constant, in the usual way; see e.g.
[33]. At r2 = œÖ we have
œÅ2 = (œÖ ‚àí2k )1/(2k+1) ,
by (3.28), and hence
‚àí2k 2k/(2k+1)
y = œÅ2k
)
œÖ.
2 r2 = (œÖ

In fact, following the analysis of the standard, slow-fast, planar, regular fold point
in [33] we obtain a similar result to [33, Proposition 2.8] for the local transition
‚àí1
map from œÅ2 = ŒΩ to r2 = œÖ near pa that is exponentially contracting like e‚àícr2
with c > 0.
Next, since r2 is increasing on M1 , we may track the slow manifold across the
sphere, using regular perturbation, PoincareÃÅ-Bendixson and the analysis in (rÃÑ = 1)1
in the previous subsection, up close to pR . We then use Lemma 3.8 and the mapping
PRC to describe the passage near pR . Recall that pR is a stable node on the sphere,
attracting every point on the quarter sphere ¬Ø ‚â• 0, rÃÑ ‚â• 0, except for certain subsets
of the invariant half-circles rÃÑ = 0 and ¬Ø = 0. See Fig. 7. By the expression in (3.27),
and the following conservation
1/(2k+1)
œÅ1 = ŒΩ ‚àí1
,
(3.29)
in chart (rÃÑ = 1)1 at 1 = ŒΩ on Œ£in,C
R , obtained by combining (3.4) and (1.16),
we reach the result on the slow manifold in Theorem 1.3(b). Also, combining the
exponential contraction near pa in chart (¬Ø
 = 1)2 with the algebraic contraction
in Lemma 3.8, we obtain the contraction of the local map Q|K as detailed in
Theorem 1.3(c).
3.5. Proof of Theorem 1.3(d). For the proof of Theorem 1.3(d), we focus on
proving the estimates in (ii) and the inequality (1.23). The estimates (i) and (iii)
are simpler and we will only discuss these at the end of this section.
The idea for (ii) is to first work in (rÃÑ = 1)1 , applying the diffeomorphisms Œ®‚àí1
i
near pi , i = L, R, respectively. The domain for x in (ii) then allows us to apply PLC ,
recall Lemma 3.5 and Lemma 3.6, possibly after adjusting the relevant constants.
Upon application of Œ®L , this brings us up to 1 = ŒΩ and x1 + 1 ‚àà [‚àíŒ∏, Œ∏] with
Œ∏ < Œ∑. From here we can ‚Äì following the analysis in the chart (¬Ø
 = 1)2 ‚Äì guide
the flow using regular perturbation theory up close to pR , where we can apply
(again after possibly adjusting relevant constants, in particular by decreasing Œ∏,
in,C
recall Remark 3.7) PRC ‚ó¶ Œ¶‚àí1

with PC the diffeomorphism obtained from the finite time flow map of (3.5) from
Œ£out,C
to Œ£in,C
L
R , see Fig. 8.
There are two main issues regarding the proof of Theorem 1.3(d). We describe
these in the following:
(1) Clearly, the mapping Q is conjugated to Q1 on  = const. sections. (The
difference between a section Œ£i and Œ®i (Œ£i ) for i = L, R is regular ‚Äì in
particular, it can be adjusted for by a simple application of the implicit
function theorem ‚Äì and consequently, we will therefore ignore such differences in the following.) Our strategy for proving Theorem 1.3 (d) is
therefore to prove an analogously statement for the mapping Q1 on  =
const. However, let (for good measure) IRL : Œ£out,C
‚Üí Œ£in,C
be defined by
L
R
ILR (œÅ1 , x1 , 1 ) = (œÅ1 , x1 , 1 ). Then a simple calculation, using Lemma 3.6
and Lemma 3.8, shows that
Ô£´

œÅ1

PRC ‚ó¶ IRL ‚ó¶ PL (œÅ1 , x1 , 1 ) = Ô£≠x1 + O(1/(2k+1) )Ô£∏

1
and hence, not surprisingly, the expansion of PLC is precisely compensated
by the contraction of PRC . Consequently, seeing that Œ®L and Œ®R are local,
regular diffeomorphisms, the contractive properties of Q1 are essentially
given by PC . We therefore need an accurate description of PC to finish the
prove Theorem 1.3(d) (ii). We will provide this description in the following.
(2) Secondly, we also need to ensure that for any c > 0, we can pick the
appropriate constants Œ∑, Œ∏ ‚àà (0, Œ∑), Œ¥, and ŒΩ in Lemma 3.6 and Lemma 3.8
such that Q0x (x, ) is monotone on the domain of (ii), attaining all values in
the interval (‚àí1 + c, c). This will be the purpose of the subsequent sections
below.
The mapping PC . To study PC our arguments will be based upon regular perturbation theory, exploiting the conservation of œÅ2k+1
1 = , and we therefore first
1
consider the invariant œÅ1 = 0-subsystem:
1
2x1 + k1 œÜ+ x1 ,
(3.31)
xÃá1 = 1 ‚àí
2
2k + 1 
Àô1 = ‚àí
2x1 + k1 œÜ+ 1 .
2k
Here and in the following, we will for simplicity write œÜ+ (0, 0) as œÜ+ . In (3.31) we
have deliberately emphasized the brackets (using curly brackets) appearing in both
equations. This allows us to write the equations in a simpler form.
Lemma 3.10. The diffeomorphism defined by
(
u = (œÜ+ k1 )‚àí1/(2k+1) x1 ,
(x1 , 1 ) 7‚Üí
v = (œÜ+ k1 )‚àí2/(2k+1) ,

(3.32)

for 1 > 0, brings (3.31) into the following system
uÃá = v 1/2 ,
vÃá = v

To study (3.33) we multiply the right hand side by v ‚àí1/2 :

Remark 3.11. The equation (3.34), written as a first order system, is known as
a Chini equation, see e.g. [42]. To the best of the author‚Äôs knowledge, no solution
by quadrature is known to exist. As a result, our analysis of this system is fairly
indirect.
Remark 3.12. Upon using (1.13) and (3.3), it is possible to write (3.32) as follows
x = (œÜ+ k )1/(2k+1) u,
y = (œÜ+ k )2/(2k+1) v.
This is the ‚Äúappropriate scaling‚Äù for
xÃá = 1,
yÃá = 2x + k y ‚àík œÜ+ ,
which is (in some sense) ‚Äúthe leading order‚Äù of the regularization of (1.11) using a
regularization function satisfying (A2).
In the (u, v)-coordinates, and for œÅ1 = 0, Œ£out,C
and Œ£in,C
both become subL
R
sets of v = (œÜ+ ŒΩ k )‚àí2/(2k+1) , with 2u + v ‚àík < 0 and 2u + v ‚àík > 0 respectively.
In the following, we let Œ£L := {(u, v)|v = (œÜ+ ŒΩ k )‚àí2/(2k+1) , 2u + v ‚àík < 0} and
Œ£R := {(u, v)|v = (œÜ+ ŒΩ k )‚àí2/(2k+1) , 2u + v ‚àík > 0}, for simplicity, denote these extended sections within v = (œÜ+ ŒΩ k )‚àí2/(2k+1) . Given the form of (3.34), we can therefore write the mapping PC for œÅ1 = 0 in the (u, v)-variables as a one-dimensional
mapping
u 7‚Üí U (u),
such that (u, v) ‚àà Œ£L gets mapped to (U (u), v) ‚àà Œ£R , see Fig. 9, where
U (u) = T (u) + u,

(3.35)

T (u) being the time of flight (see also (3.49) below for a formal definition).
Lemma 3.13. The following holds
U 0 (u) ‚àà (‚àí1, 0),

U 00 (u) < 0,

(3.36)

for all (u, v) ‚àà Œ£L with 2u + v ‚àík < 0.
We delay the proof to the end of this Section 3. Fix Œ∂ > 0 small enough. Then
upon returning to x1 using (3.32), we obtain the following expression for PC for
œÅ1 = 0:
Ô£´
Ô£∂

PC (0, x1 , ŒΩ) = Ô£≠XC,0 (x1 )Ô£∏
ŒΩ
where
XC,0 (x1 ) = (œÜ+ ŒΩ k )1/(2k+1) U ((œÜ+ ŒΩ k )‚àí1/(2k+1) x1 ),
for x1 ‚àà [‚àí1 ‚àí Œ∂, ‚àí1 + Œ∂]. By Lemma 3.13 we have the following:

(3.37)

THE REGULARIZED VISIBLE FOLD REVISITED

Lemma 3.14. For any c > 0, there exists a ŒΩ0 such that for any ŒΩ ‚àà (0, ŒΩ0 ] we
have
0
XC,0
(x1 ) ‚àà (‚àí1 + c, c),

00
XC,0
(x1 ) < 0,

for all x1 ‚àà [‚àí1 ‚àí Œ∂, ‚àí1 + Œ∂].
Proof. Consider the point on Œ£out,C
with x1 = ‚àí1 + Œ∂. Then upon decreasing
L
0
ŒΩ > 0, a simple calculation shows that XC,0
(x1 ) can be made as close to ‚àí1 as
desired. Basically, the invariance of 1 = 0, x1 ‚àà (‚àí1, 1) leads us to consider the
variational equations. This produces an equation of the form 01 (x) = 1 x/(x2 ‚àí 1)
upon eliminating time. Using that the right hand side is an odd function in x1 , we
obtain that the linearized map is x1 7‚Üí ‚àíx1 .
On the other hand, if we consider a point x1 = ‚àí1 ‚àí Œ∂, then upon decreasing
ŒΩ > 0 we can follow the flow by a finite time flow map, working in the charts
(xÃÑ = ‚àí1)3 and (¬Ø
 = 1)2 successively, up close to the center manifold of pa , recall
Fig. 8 and Lemma 3.9 item (1). The consequence of the contraction towards this
0
(x1 ) ‚Üí 0‚àí as ŒΩ ‚Üí 0, see also Section 3.4 above. Using
manifold is that XC,0
(3.36), we therefore have that for any c > 0 that there exists a ŒΩ0 such that for any
ŒΩ ‚àà (0, ŒΩ0 ] we have
0
XC,0
(x1 ) ‚àà (‚àí1 + c, ‚àíc),

00
XC,0
(x1 ) < 0,

for all x1 ‚àà [‚àí1 ‚àí Œ∂, ‚àí1 + Œ∂], as desired.

By regular perturbation theory (seeing that PC is obtained from a finite time

Finishing the proof of Theorem 1.3(d). The result in Theorem 1.3(d) (ii) now follows
upon combining Lemma 3.15 and Lemma 3.16 using Lemma 3.14. Indeed, we have
Lemma 3.17. For any c > 0 there exist constants Œ∑, Œ∏ ‚àà (0, Œ∑), Œ¥ and ŒΩ such that

To prove (i) in Theorem 1.3(d), we sketch the argument as follows. First, we
work in chart (œÅÃÑ = 1)1 near pL using the coordinates in Lemma 3.5. We then
in,L
describe a mapping from Œ£L
, consisting of all those points in Œ£in
L with x1 <
‚àíŒ∏(1 ŒΩ ‚àí1 )2k/(2k+1) , recall (3.21), to the section
Œ£out,L
= {(œÅ1 , x1 , 1 )|x1 = ‚àíŒΩ, œÅ1 ‚àà [0, Œ≤1 ], 1 ‚àà [0, Œ≤2 ]}.
L
This gives an expanding map, but as before, this expansion is (more than) compensated by the contraction eventually gained at pR . Essentially, the result therefore
follows from the details of the mapping from Œ£out,L
to Œ£in,C
L
R . This mapping can be
described in two parts. The first part consists of a simple, near-identity mapping,
near (œÅÃÑ, xÃÑ, ¬Ø) = (0, ‚àí1, 0), which can be studied in the chart xÃÑ = ‚àí1, the details of
which are standard and left out of this manuscript completely for simplicity. The
second part, is described in (¬Ø
 = 1)2 using the local dynamics near the nonhyperbolic saddle pa . This mapping is contracting due to the exponential contraction
towards the center manifold that extends the invariant manifold S onto the blowup
sphere, recall Lemma 3.9 item (1). In combination, this then proves (i).
(iii) in Theorem 1.3(d) is simpler and can be described in the chart (rÃÑ = 1)1 only.
For this, we again apply Œ¶‚àí1
near pi , i = L, R, respectively, and define a mapping
i
in,R
‚àí1 2k/(2k+1)
)
, to
from Œ£L , consisting of all those points in Œ£in
L with x1 > Œ∏(1 ŒΩ
Œ£out,R
= {(œÅ1 , x1 , 1 )|x1 = Œ∑, œÅ1 ‚àà [0, Œ≤1 ], 1 ‚àà [0, Œ≤2 ]}.
L
We subsequently follow this by a regular finite time flow map from Œ£out,R
to
L
Œ£in,L
= {(œÅ1 , x1 , 1 )|x1 = ‚àíŒ∑, œÅ1 ‚àà [0, Œ≤1 ], 1 ‚àà [0, Œ≤2 ]},
R
and lastly by a local mapping from Œ£in,L
to Œ£out
R , recall Fig. 8. In this case, the
R
in,L
out,R
to Œ£R ‚Äì as in the proof of Lemma 3.14 ‚Äì can be made as
mapping from Œ£L
close to the identity in œÅ1 and 1 as desired. In combination, this proves (iii) and
the proof Theorem 1.3. In particular, we highlight that the domains of (i) and (ii)
as well as of (ii) and (iii) can (and will) be chosen to overlap.
Proof of Lemma 3.13. Following (3.35), we prove Lemma 3.13 by estimating T 0 (u)
and T 00 (u). We will do so consecutively in the following.
Let c = (œÜ+ ŒΩ k )‚àí2/(2k+1) and write the solution of (3.34) with initial conditions
(u0 , c) ‚àà Œ£L as (u(t, u0 ), v(t, u0 )), i.e. (u(0, u0 ), v(0, u0 )) = (u0 , c) for any u0 . Then
T (u0 ) > 0 is the least positive solution satisfying
v(T (u0 ), u0 ) = c.

(3.49)

Differentiating (3.49) gives
T 0 (u0 ) = ‚àí

vu0 (T (u0 ), u0 )
.
vt0 (T (u0 ), u0 )

Notice that if
vu0 (T (u0 ), u0 ) < 2vt0 (T (u0 ), u0 ),

(3.51)

T 0 (u0 ) > ‚àí2.

then, by (3.50),

Since PC0 (u) < 0 is trivial, this inequality implies the first claim in (3.36) by differentiating (3.35). To show (3.51) let v1 (t) = vu0 (t, u0 ) so that v1 (0) = 0 and

vt0 (t, u0 )

Clearly, v1 (t) > 0 for all t > 0. Now, vÃá(t, u0 ) =
also satisfies the equation
(3.53), but with the initial condition vÃá(0, u0 ) = 2u0 + c‚àík < 0. In light of (3.51),
we therefore write v1 as
v1 = 2vÃá ‚àí w.

(3.54)

A simple calculations, shows that w = w(t, u0 ) also satisfies (3.53):
wÃá = 2 ‚àí kv ‚àík‚àí1 w,

(3.55)

but now w(0, u0 ) = 2vÃá(0, u0 ) < 0. We will now show that for all u0
0 < w(T (u0 ), u0 ).

(3.56)

Adding v1 = 2vÃá(T (u0 ), u0 ) ‚àí w(T (u0 ), u0 ) to both sides of this equation, using
(3.54), produces (3.51) and therefore (3.52) as desired.
For (3.56), notice by (3.55) that wÃá ‚â• 2 for all w ‚â§ 0. Hence there exists a unique
t‚àó (u0 ) such that
w(t‚àó (u0 ), u0 ) = 0.

(3.57)

Notice that t‚àó (u0 ) is a smooth function of u0 by the implicit function theorem.
Next, for values of u0 < ‚àíc‚àík /2, sufficiently close to ‚àíc‚àík /2 (the value of u when
the v-nullcline intersects v = c), a simple calculation shows that


T 0 (u0 ) = ‚àí2 ‚àí kc‚àík‚àí1 c‚àík + 2u0 + O c‚àík /2 + u0

and t‚àó (u0 ) < T (u0 ). Hence, for these values of u0 , it follows that (3.56), and
therefore also (3.52), holds.
Suppose that upon decreasing u0 we find a first u‚àó such that T (u‚àó ) = t‚àó (u‚àó ).
Notice then by (3.50) and (3.54) that T 0 (u‚àó ) = ‚àí2, and
t0‚àó (u‚àó ) ‚â§ ‚àí2,
‚àík

since t‚àó (u0 ) < T (u0 ) for all u0 ‚àà (u‚àó , ‚àíc

w1 (t‚àó (u‚àó ), u‚àó ))

(3.59)

(3.60)

with w1 (0) = 4. In (3.59), we have also used that wÃá = 2 at t = t‚àó where w = 0.
Since w(t, u‚àó ) < 0 for all t ‚àà [0, t‚àó (u‚àó )), and v1 (t, u‚àó ) > 0 for all t, we have by (3.60)
that w1 (t‚àó (u‚àó ), u‚àó ) < 4. But then by (3.59)
t0‚àó (u‚àó ) > ‚àí2.
However, this contradicts (3.58) and hence no u‚àó exists. Consequently, T (u0 ) >
t‚àó (u0 ) for all u0 < ‚àíc‚àík /2 and therefore (3.52) holds.
For the subsequent claim in (3.36), we obtain the following expression for T 00 (u0 )

T 00 (u0 ) = ‚àí 0
(2PC0 (u0 )(PC0 (u0 ) ‚àí 1) + v2 (T (u0 ))) ,

by differentiating (3.49) twice with respect to u0 , where v2 (t) = vuu
(t, u0 ) satisfies
v2 (0) = 0 and

vÃá2 = ‚àíkv ‚àík‚àí1 v2 + k(k + 1)v ‚àík‚àí2 v12 .
Since vÃá1 (0) = 2 and v1 (t) > 0, it follows that v2 (t) > 0 for all t > 0. Consequently,
by the first property in (3.36), (3.61) gives T 00 (u0 ) < 0, proving the last property
in (3.36).

4. Proof of Theorem 1.7
We now move on to prove Theorem 1.7. The periodic orbits we describe are fix
points of P (¬∑, Œ±, ), recall (1.25).
Lemma 4.1. We have:
(1) Fix Œ± < 0 sufficiently small. Then locally there exists two and only two fix
points of P (¬∑, Œ±, ) for all 0 <   1.
(2) Fix Œ± > 0 sufficiently small. Then no local fix points exist of P (¬∑, Œ±, ) for
all 0 <   1.
Proof. We first prove (1). Consider therefore Œ± < 0 sufficiently small. Then we
obtain, by the properties in Lemma 1.6, using Lemma 1.1, that L 3 x 7‚Üí P (x, Œ±, )
is a strong contraction within some open subset L ‚äÇ K, recall Theorem 1.3(c). This
produces a hyperbolic and attracting fix-point of P in L by the contraction mapping
theorem. This fix-point for Œ± < 0 co-exists with the hyperbolic and repelling fixpoint obtained by the regular perturbation of ŒìŒ± ‚äÇ {y ‚â• c(Œ±) > 0} of Z+ , for some
c(Œ±) > 0, using Lemma 1.1. The fact that only two intersections exist is a simple
consequence of the properties of Q in Theorem 1.3(d). Case (2) in Lemma 4.1 is
also a simple corollary of Lemma 1.6 and Theorem 1.3(d).


Remark 4.2. [3, Theorem 2.3] is basically Lemma 4.1 for the Sotomayor-Teixera
regularization functions considered in that paper. It rests, as the proof Lemma 4.1,
upon the domains (i) and (iii) in Theorem 1.3 (d). But as we shall see below, the
intermediate domain (ii) in Theorem 1.3 (d) allow for a description of what occurs
in between the cases (1) and (2) in Lemma 4.1. In fact, the results of Theorem 1.3
enable a very direct approach for this regime using the implicit function theorem.
Following (1.29), fix points are intersections of the two graphs of Q(¬∑, Œ±, ) and
R‚àí1 (¬∑, Œ±, ). In particular, transverse intersections correspond to hyperbolic periodic orbits. We illustrate this viewpoint in Fig. 10 in the case where no intersections
occur, e.g. for Œ± > 0 and 0 <   1, recall Lemma 4.1 (2). Following Theorem 1.3(d) and Lemma 1.6, it is easy to use this graphical framework together with
(1.23) to prove the existence of a unique saddle-node bifurcation, occurring within
the domain (ii) of Theorem 1.3(d). Notice in particular, by Lemma 1.6, see also
(1.27), that the slope of R‚àí1 (¬∑, Œ±, ), being the right hand side of (1.29), is greater
than ‚àí1 + œâ, say, for some (new) fixed œâ > 0, and all  ‚àà [0, 0 ), Œ± ‚àà I. From the
picture in Fig. 10, the saddle-node is by Lemma 1.6, see (1.28), obtained by decreasing Œ±. However, to obtain (1.33) we proceed using an implicit function theorem
argument as follows: Consider Q1 (3.30) and the associated one-dimensional map

THE REGULARIZED VISIBLE FOLD REVISITED

35

(3.46) obtained on the level sets defined by œÅ2k+1
1 = . However, in the context of
1
Theorem 1.7, we now write the right hand side of (3.46) as X (x1 , Œ±) highlighting
the dependency on the bifurcation parameter Œ±. Then introduce x2 and Œ±2 by
x1 = 2k/(2k+1) x2 ,

Œ± = 2k/(2k+1) Œ±2 ,

(4.1)

and let
Q2 (x2 , Œ±2 , ) := ‚àí2k/(2k+1) X (2k/(2k+1) x2 , 2k/(2k+1) Œ±2 , ).
Lemma 4.3. Q2 satisfies the following estimates


Q2 (x2 , Œ±2 , ) = œá‚àí1 XR,0 ‚ó¶ XC,0 ‚ó¶ XeL,0 (œáx2 ) + O(1/(2k+1) ),

(4.2)

(4.3)

where x2 ‚àà [‚àíŒ∏œá‚àí1 , Œ∏œá‚àí1 ], recall (3.42). The order of the remainder in (4.3) does
not change as  ‚Üí 0 upon differentiation with respect to x2 and Œ±2 . In particular,
for any c > 0 there exists Œ∑, Œ∏ ‚àà (0, Œ∑),Œ¥ and ŒΩ such that

0
(Q2 )0x2 (x2 , Œ±2 , 0) = XR,0 ‚ó¶ XC,0 ‚ó¶ XeL,0 (œáx2 ) ‚àà (‚àí1 + c, ‚àíc),

00
(Q2 )00x2 x2 (x2 , Œ±2 , 0) = œá XR,0 ‚ó¶ XC,0 ‚ó¶ XeL,0 (œáx2 ) < 0

Proof. Follows from the definition of Q2 and Lemma 3.17, recall also (3.44) and
(3.45).

Next, we continue to write the smooth R‚àí1 (¬∑, Œ±, ) in the (rÃÑ = 1)1 -chart and
express the resulting mapping in the same coordinates used for Q1 in (3.30) by
composing the resulting mapping with Œ®L from the left and Œ®‚àí1
R from the right.
Subsequently, define R2‚àí1 (x2 , Œ±2 , ) completely analogously to (4.2) by first going
to a one-dimensional mapping on the level sets œÅ2k+1
1 = , insert (4.1) into the
1
resulting expression and ‚Äúblow up‚Äù Œ≥R by dividing the resulting expression by
‚àí2k/(2k+1) as in (4.2).
Lemma 4.4. R2‚àí1 is smooth in x2 and Œ±2 . Also R2‚àí1 satisfy the following estimate
R2‚àí1 (x2 , Œ±2 , ) = œÖ0 x2 + œÖ1 Œ±2 + O(1/(2k+1) ),

(4.4)

where œÖ0 ‚àà (‚àí1, 0), œÖ1 > 0 upon possibly decreasing Œ∑, ŒΩ and Œ¥.
Proof. Simple consequence of the smoothness of R, the fact that R(Œ≥R , 0, 0) = Œ≥L
and finally that XR (œÅ1 , ¬∑, 1 ) and XeL (œÅ1 , ¬∑, 1 ) are as close to their linearization as
desired upon decreasing Œæ. In particular, the estimates for œÖ0 and œÖ1 then follow
0
from the fact that Rx0 (Œ≥R , 0, 0)‚àí1 ‚àà (‚àí1, 0), RŒ±
(Œ≥R , 0, 0)‚àí1 > 0 by Lemma 1.6. 
The fix-point equation (1.29) becomes
Q2 (x2 , , Œ±) = R2‚àí1 (x2 , Œ±2 , ),

(4.5)

in terms of Q2 and R2‚àí1 . This equation is suitable for the application of the implicit
function theorem. In particular, each side is at least C 2 with respect to x2 and Œ±2 ,
depending continuously on  ‚àà [0, 0 ).

36

K. ULDALL KRISTIANSEN

Lemma 4.5. For each  ‚àà [0, 0 ), there exists a unique solution (x2 (), Œ±2 (), ) of
(4.5), x2 () and Œ±2 () both being continuous in  ‚àà [0, 0 ), such that
(Q2 )0x2 = (R2‚àí1 )0x2 ,
(Q2 )00x2 x2
(Q2 )0Œ±2

(R2‚àí1 )00x2 x2 ,
(R2‚àí1 )0Œ±2 ,

(Nondegeneracy condition I),
(Nondegeneracy condition II),

(4.6)
(4.7)
(4.8)

with all partial derivatives evaluated at (x2 (), Œ±2 (), ).
Proof. Consider  = 0. Then by Lemma 4.3 and Lemma 4.4, (4.5) becomes
Q2 (x2 , Œ±2 , 0) ‚àí œÖ0 x2 ‚àí œÖ1 Œ±2 = 0,

(4.9)

Furthemore, (4.6) becomes
(Q2 )0x2 (x2 , Œ±2 , 0) ‚àí œÖ0 = 0.

(4.10)

Seeing that œÖ0 ‚àà (‚àí1, 0), it follows by Lemma 4.3 ‚Äì taking c > 0 so small that œÖ0 ‚àà
(‚àí1+c, c) ‚Äì that that the equation (4.10) has a unique solution x2 ‚àà [‚àíŒ∏œá‚àí1 , Œ∏œá‚àí1 ].
Inserting this into (4.9) gives a unique Œ±2 since œÖ1 6= 0. Notice that the resulting
 = 0 solution (x2 , Œ±2 ) satisfies the nondegenaracy conditions (4.7) and (4.8). In
particular, by computing the Jacobian of the left hand sides of (4.9) and (4.10)
with respect to (x2 , Œ±2 ), we obtain the matrix


(Q2 )0x2 (x2 , Œ±2 , 0) ‚àíœÖ1
0
(Q2 )00x2 x2 (x2 , Œ±2 , 0)
which is regular by Lemma 4.3. The existence of a unique continuous solution
(x2 (), Œ±2 ()) for all 0 <  ‚â§ 0 with the described properties therefore follows from
the implicit function theorem.

Returning to x and Œ±, the solution in Lemma 4.5 becomes x = 2k/(2k+1) x2 (), Œ± =

Œ±2 () as desired. This is the unique saddle-node bifurcation of (1.25),
since (4.6), (4.7) and (4.8) imply (1.30), (1.31) and (1.32), respectively. The proof
of Theorem 1.7 is therefore complete.

5. Discussion
Comparison with previous results. [3] also describes the regularization of the
visible fold, but only for the class of regularizations in (1.10). They also assume
an algebraic condition like (A2) but at s = ¬±1 rather than asymptotically. [3,
Theorem 2.2] describes the invariant manifold‚Äôs intersection with a fixed section,
similar to Theorem 1.3(b). For their regularization functions, m() = Œ≥R + O() to
leading order for any k. (In [26, Thoerem 3.3] this result was rediscovered using
blowup. This also allowed for a more detailed expression of the remainder; it is a
smooth function of 1/(2k+1) .) Notice that in our case, m() = Œ≥R + O(2k/(2k+1 ),
see Theorem 1.3(b), where k = k+ is the decay rate in (A2). Going through the
details, we may also realise that it is a smooth function of 1/(2k+1) but in general
only C l , l = l(k) ‚â• 1, due to the resonances (producing log‚Äôs), recall (3.7).
[3, Theorem 2.4] also addresses the grazing bifurcation, described in the present
manuscript in Theorem 1.7, but neither [3], nor the conference paper [2] by the
same authors, did rigorously establish existence nor uniqueness of a saddle-node
bifurcation. Our results improve on their findings in several ways. Firstly, we
provide more details close to the tangency, see Theorem 1.3(d), for a more general,

Figure 10. Graphs of Q (thick curve in different colours) and R‚àí1
(thick dashed line), following Theorem 1.3(d) and Lemma 1.6. The
different colours on the graph of Q, represents the different domains
in Theorem 1.3(d): Green for the domain in (i), purple for the
domain in (ii), which is O(2k/(2k+1 )-close to Œ≥L , red for the domain
in (iii). By Lemma 1.6, a unique quadratic tangency between these
graphs occur within the purple domain, upon adjusting Œ±. This
tangency is the saddle-node bifurcation of limit cycles.
and more ‚Äúpractical‚Äù, class of regularization functions. In turn, this allowed us to
prove the existence and uniqueness of a saddle-node bifurcation in the regularized
grazing bifurcation. Interestingly, in [3], the equation y 0 (x) = x + y k , where k is
the order of the tangency at s = 1, recall (1.10), plays an important role. For our
regularization functions, satisfying (A1)-(A2), this equation is replaced by a Chini
equation v 0 (u) = 2u + v ‚àík , see (3.34), where k = k+ is the decay rate in (A2).
The blowup approach. Our approach to the problem was to use blowup [9, 33]
following [32]. This framework is general, see also the outlook below, and has
all the benefits that come with using blowup. The blowup method frequently
provides remarkably detailed insight into complicated global dynamical phenomena,
often even in a constructive way, see [5, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28]. For the planar visible
fold studied in the present paper, we applied two consecutive blowups, blowing up
the discontinuity set to a cylinder and the visible fold to a sphere, and obtained
improved hyperbolicity properties. This allowed us to obtain the desired results by
combining:
(a) The existence of an invariant manifold, see Lemma 3.9 item (1);
(b) The (special) linearization used in Section 3.2 near the hyperbolic points
pL and pR , recall Lemma 3.5;
‚Äì both based on classical local results in dynamical systems theory (center manifold
theory, linearization, etc.) ‚Äì with a global analysis of the Chini equation (3.34).
In contrast to e.g. [32], we use blowup to study ‚Äì for the first time ‚Äì a very
general class of regularization functions, including functions such as the GoldbeterKoshland function (1.6) that appear in applications.

38

K. ULDALL KRISTIANSEN

We highlight that the Sotomayor-Teixera regularization functions used in [3] are
easier to study in general than the ones satisfying (A1)-(A2). In fact, a proper
cylindrical blowup of y =  = 0 is strictly speaking not necessary for these systems.
Indeed, the PWS system coincides with the regularized one outside |y| ‚â§  for these
functions and one does therefore not lose compactness in the ‚Äúscaling chart‚Äù (¬Ø
 = 1)2
(1.17) where y = y2 . In fact, one can just restrict to y2 ‚àà [‚àí1, 1]. Consequently,
for these systems, the directional charts (yÃÑ = 1)1 and (yÃÑ = ‚àí1)3 , recall (1.16) and
(1.18), are not necessary for the global picture. This is exploited in [3, 30, 31].
As a consequence, the blowup of T for the Sotomayor-Teixera functions have a
‚Äúscaling chart‚Äù, where the variables local to (x, y2 , ) = (0, 1, 0) are just scaled
by appropriate roots of . In our case, the blowup of T is more complicated, as
none of the directional charts, see (3.3) and (3.4), correspond to pure scalings. I
therefore believe that it is not clear how one would reproduce the results of our
paper (rigorously) using asymptotic methods.
Regularization functions. In this paper, we have considered a wide class of
regularization functions. However, it may seem restrictive that (1.4) holds for all
. But if

b() for y2 ‚Üí ‚àû,
œÜ(y2 , ) ‚Üí
(5.1)
a() for y2 ‚Üí ‚àí‚àû,
for example, with a(0) < b(0), then
œÜÃÉ(y2 , ) =

œÜ(y2 , ) ‚àí a()
.
b() ‚àí a()

satisfies (1.4). We can then write Z(z, œÜ, Œ±) = ZÃÉ(z, œÜÃÉ, , Œ±) and subsequently ZÃÉ in
the form (1.2). Notice, that following this procedure ZÃÉ¬± will in general depend
upon . However, only to keep the notation as simple as possible, we focused on
the simpler setting in (1.2).
The class of functions described by (A1)-(A2) include standard regularization
functions, such as arctan and (1.19) but also nontrivial ones like the GoldbeterKoshland function (1.6) where k¬± = 1. Functions like tanh and (1.9), where k¬± =
‚àû in (A2), are more difficult, because the blowup method does not apply directly,
but they can, at least when the remainder is exponential, be tackled using the
technique in [26], see e.g. [26, Theorem 3.5].
Qualitatively, different regularization functions within our class do not change
the results. However, the decay rate k = k+ in (A2) does change the details
quantitatively, see (1.22) and (1.33).
If the regularization function œÜ is not monotone, such that (A1) and (1.3) are not
satisfied, then the critical manifold S upon blowup, will have folds, where, working
in the scaling chart (¬Ø
 = 1)2 , see (A.1), classical results from singular ‚àö
perturbation
theory can be applied, e.g. [33] or canard theory [34]. (œÜ(s, ) = s/ s2 + s + 1
is an example with a fold s = ‚àí2‚àí1 ‚Üí ‚àí‚àû for  ‚Üí 0. In such cases, additional
blowups in the directional charts are probably required to resolve such phenomena.)
In particular, due to such folds, the critical manifold will be repelling close to the
point T . See also [4, 19] for applications; in these cases Filippov does not agree
with the  ‚Üí 0 limit. They can, however, be studied by the same methods used in
the present paper. The generalization of Theorem 1.7 will then include a canard
phenomenon where the unstable limit cycles can be extended beyond the tangency

THE REGULARIZED VISIBLE FOLD REVISITED

point until they reach the fold of the critical manifold. We leave the details of
this case to future work. Similarly, if (A0) does not hold, then the scaling chart,
obtained by setting y = y2 , is simply a general slow-fast system; it can be as
complicated as any planar slow-fast system and there is little value in making the
PWS connection in a general framework.
Outlook. Going forward, I have together with co-authors applied the approach in
the present paper to two systems in applications, see [19] and [29]. In particular,
in [19] we study singularly perturbed oscillators with exponential nonlinearities of
‚àí1
the form ey . These systems have nonsmooth limits upon normalization and
can be written in the form (1.1) with œÜ as in (1.9). Due to the exponentials in
(1.9), however, we apply a slight modification of the approach used in the present
manuscript (by following [26]) to handle the resulting k¬± = ‚àû in (A2). In [29], on
the other hand, we study substrate-depletion oscillators which have a switch-like
function modelling an autocatalytic process. In [49], this switch is described by the
Goldbeter-Koshland function (1.6). We combine the method used in the present
paper with a parameter space blowup to describe the existence and nonexistence
of limit cycles in the substrate-depletion oscillators close to their PWS limits. We
find that the main mechanism for the oscillations is due to a ‚Äúboundary node
bifurcation‚Äù [36, 18] where a node of the PWS system intersects the discontinuity
set. Our spherical blowup of a fold point, like T in the present paper, captures this
transition.
In [20], we consider a related situation of a ‚Äúboundary focus bifurcation‚Äù [36]
in the friction oscillator problem for Œ± = 0, recall Section 2. For 0 <   1 this
PWS bifurcation gives rise to an additional Hopf bifurcation (now supercritical) on
a blowup sphere (like the blowup of T in the present paper). We again combine the
blowup approach promoted in this paper with a parameter space blowup with the
overall aim to connect (in a smooth family) the attracting Hopf cycles all the way
up to the O(1) cycles that bifurcate near the PWS grazing bifurcation, as described
in Corollary 2.1.

I would like to thank Samuel Jelbart for bringing the friction oscillator and the
model (2.5) to my attention, for sharing references on the subject and for providing
valuable feedback on an earlier version of the manuscript.
Appendix A. Proof of Theorem 1.3(a)
The analysis in the chart yÃÑ = ‚àí1, see (1.16), plays little role and is similar to
how we deal with yÃÑ = 1. The details are therefore omitted. In the following we
therefore consider ¬Ø = 1 and yÃÑ = 1 only.
A.1. Chart ¬Ø = 1. In this chart, we obtain the following equations
xÃá = œÜ(y2 , )(1 + f (x, y2 )),

(A.1)

yÃá2 = œÜ(y2 , )(2x + y2 g(x, y2 )) + 1 ‚àí œÜ(y2 , ),
and rÃá2 = 0, using (1.11) and (1.1) in (1.12). This is a slow-fast system with x slow
and y2 fast. Setting  = 0 gives the layer problem where x is a parameter and
yÃá2 = œÜ(y2 , 0)2x + 1 ‚àí œÜ(y2 , 0),

40

K. ULDALL KRISTIANSEN

and hence a normally hyperbolic and attracting, but noncompact, critical manifold:
S = {(x, y2 ) ‚àà UŒæ |œÜ(y2 , 0) =

1
, x < 0}.
1 ‚àí 2x

(A.2)

Fixing J = [‚àíŒæ, ‚àíŒΩ], we can apply Fenichel‚Äôs theory to S ‚à© {x ‚àà J} and conclude
the existence of the invariant manifold S in Theorem 1.3(a). The fact that Z|S
is a regular perturbation of the Filippov vector-field is standard and follows easily
from the fact that the reduced problem on S:
x0 = œÜ(y2 , 0)(1 + f (x, 0)) =

1
(1 + f (x, 0)),
1 ‚àí 2x

coincides with Filippov.
A.2. Chart yÃÑ = 1. Upon inserting (1.16) into (1.12), using (1.1) and (1.11), we
obtain the following equations
rÃá1 = ‚àír1 F (r1 , x, 1 ),
xÃá = r1 (1 ‚àí k1 œÜ+ (r1 , 1 ))(1 + f (x, r1 ),
Àô1 = 1 F (r1 , x, 1 ),
after dividing the right hand side by 1 (as promised in our description of the
blowup approach, see Section 1.4). In these equations we have introduced the
following function where
F (r1 , x, 1 ) = ‚àí(1 ‚àí k1 œÜ+ (r1 , 1 ))(2x + r1 g(x, r1 )) ‚àí k1 œÜ+ (r1 , 1 ).
Remark A.1. Notice that within the invariant subset defined by 1 = 0, we have
F1 (r1 , x, 0) = ‚àí(2x + r1 g(x, r1 )) and hence
xÃá = y(1 + f (x, y)),
yÃá = ‚àíy(2x + yg(x, y)),
using that r1 = y. But this is just yZ+ , see (1.11).
Now, focus first on x ‚àà J. Then for r1 ‚â• 0 and 1 ‚â• 0 but sufficiently small
we have F > 0 and hence the system is topological equivalent with the following
version
rÃá1 = ‚àír1 ,

(A.3)

xÃá = r1 (1 ‚àí k1 œÜ+ (r1 , 1 ))

(1 + f (x, r1 )
,
F (r1 , x, 1 )

Àô1 = 1 ,
The set r1 = 1 = 0 is therefore a line of equilibria having stable and unstable manifolds contained within 1 = 0 and r1 = 0, respectively. We can straighten out the
individual unstable manifolds of points on x ‚àà J, r1 = 1 = 0 by a transformation
of the form xÃÉ 7‚Üí x = m(xÃÉ, r1 ), r1 ‚àà [0, Œæ] with m smooth, with m0xÃÉ > 0. Applying
this transformation to (A.3) gives
rÃá1 = ‚àír1 ,
xÃá = G(r1 , x, 1 ),
Àô1 = 1 ,

dropping the tilde on x. Recall here that  = r1 1 . Therefore if we consider an
initial condition with r1 (0) = Œ¥ > 0 small, then
r1 (t) = e‚àít Œ¥,

(A.4)

x(t) = x(0) + O(t),
1 (t) = et 1 (0).
Now, we wish to extend the stable foliation of S by the backward flow. For this
let x ‚àà J, after possibly decreasing ŒΩ > 0 and Œæ, and consider the leaf Fx, of the
Fenichel foliation of S . We therefore flow this set forward t = O(log ‚àí1 ), which is
the time it takes for r1 to go from O(1) to O(). This gives a new x, x0 = x ¬∑ t, say,
and a new leaf Fx0 , . Notice œÜt (Fx, ) ‚äÇ Fx0 , and hence we extend Fx, by flowing
Fx0 , backwards by time t. (In general, Fx0 , will not be fully covered by the chart
yÃÑ = 1 and therefore we will have to work in separate charts.) We do this by using
(A.4), which produces the extended leafs as images of Lipschitz mappings.
