Abstract. We consider the class of the continuous functions from [0, 1]
into itself which preserve the Lebesgue measure. This class endowed with
the uniform metric constitutes a complete metric space. We investigate the
dynamical properties of typical maps from the space.

1. Introduction and summary of results
This article is about typical properties of continuous maps of the interval which
preserve the Lebesgue measure. Throughout the article the word typical will
mean that with respect to the uniform topology there is a dense Gδ set of
maps having this property. Such results are in the domain of approximation
theory. To our knowledge, the use of approximation techniques in dynamical
systems was started in 1941 by Oxtoby and Ulam who considered a simplicial polyhedron with a non-atomic measure which is positive on open sets. In
this setting they showed that the set of ergodic measure-preserving homeomorphisms is typical in the strong topology [32]. In 1944 Halmos introduced
approximation techniques in a purely metric situation: the study of invertible
mode 0 maps of the interval [0, 1] which preserve the Lebesgue measure. He
showed that the typical invertible map is weakly mixing, i.e., has continuous
spectrum [19],[20],[21]. In 1948 Rohlin showed that the set of (strongly) mixing measure preserving invertible maps is of the first category [29]. In 1967
Katok and Stepin [24] introduced the notation of speed of approximation. One
of the notable applications of their method is the typicality of ergodicity and
weak mixing for certain classes of interval exchange transformations. Katok
has shown that interval exchange transformations are never mixing [23].

The study of typical properties of homeomorphism of compact manifolds which
preserve regular measures was continued and generalized by Katok and Stepin
in 1970 [25] who showed the typicality of ergodicity, of simple continuous spectrum, and the absence of mixing. In 1980 Yano showed that the generic homeomorphism of a compact manifold has infinite entropy [35]. More recently
Alpern and co-authors have unified the studies of homeomorphisms and of
measure preserving transformations and shown that if a property is typical for
measure preserving transformations then it is typical for homeomorphisms [3],
[2], [4]. Recently many authors have shown that that the shadowing property
is generic in various setting: [12], [18], [26], [27],[33].
Except for Yano’s result which also holds for generic continuous maps of compact manifolds, all of these results are about invertible maps. The measure
theoretic properties of C 0 -generic systems on compact manifolds have first been
studied by Abdenur and Andersson [1]; their main result is that a C 0 -generic
map has no physical measure, however the Birkhoff average of any continuous
function is convergent for Lebesgue a.e. point. Catsigeras and Troubetzkoy
gave a quite detailed description of the invariant measures of C 0 generic continuous maps of compact manifolds with or without boundary (as well as for
generic homeomorphisms in the same setting) [13], [14], [15].
Many more more details of the history of approximation theory can be found
in the surveys [16], [7].
In this article we consider the set C(λ) if continuous non-invertible maps of the
unit interval [0, 1] which preserve the Lebsegue measure λ. Every such map
has a dense set of periodic points. Furthermore, except for the two exceptional
maps id and 1 − id, every such map has positive metric entropy. The C(λ)typical function (all the properties will be defined later in the article):
(i)
(ii)
(iii)

(vi)
(vii)

is weakly mixing with respect to λ (Theorem 15),
is leo (Theorem 9),
satisfies the periodic specification property (Corollary 10)
has a knot point at λ almost every point [11],
maps a set of Lebesgue measure zero onto [0, 1] (Corollary 22),
has infinite topological entropy (Proposition 26),
has Hausdorff dimension = lower Box dimension = 1 < upper Box
dimension = 2 [31].

Furthermore, in analogy to Rohlin’s result, we show that the set of mixing
maps in C(λ) is dense (Corollary 14) and of the first category (Theorem 20).
We also show that for any c > 0 as well as for c = ∞ the set of maps having
metric entropy c is dense in C(λ), however, we do not know if there is a value
c such that this set is generic.

Points i) and vi) and the furthermore results are analogous to results in the
invertible case, and the proofs of these results follow the same general plan as
in the invertible case. The other points have no analogies in the invertible case
Let µ be a probability Borel measure with full support, let C(µ) be the set
of all continuous interval maps preserving the measure µ equipped with the
uniform metric. The map h : [0, 1] → [0, 1] defined as h(x) = µ([0, x]) for
x ∈ [0, 1], is a homeomorphism of [0, 1]. In fact, in this settings λ = h∗ µ, i.e.,
λ is the pushforward measure of µ by h. Moreover, the map H : C(λ) → C(µ)
given by f 7−→ h−1 ◦ f ◦ h is a homermoprhism of the spaces C(λ) and C(µ).
Using H, we can transfer the properties (i)-(vi) listed above into the context of
C(µ). In particular, the property (iv) in C(µ) says that C(µ)-typical function
has a knot point at µ almost every point [11].
2. Maps in C(λ)
Let λ denote the Lebesgue measure on [0, 1] and B the Borel sets in [0, 1]. Let
C(λ) consist of all continuous λ-preserving functions from [0, 1] onto [0, 1], i.e.,
C(λ) = {f : [0, 1] → [0, 1] : ∀A ∈ B, λ(A) = λ(f −1 (A))}.
We consider the uniform metric ρ on C(λ): ρ(f, g) := supx∈[0,1] |f (x) − g(x)|.
Proposition 1. (C(λ), ρ) is a complete metric space.
We leave the standard proof of this result to the reader.
Definition 2. We say that continuous maps f, g : [a, b] ⊂ [0, 1] → [0, 1] are
λ-equivalent if for each Borel set A ∈ B,
λ(f −1 (A)) = λ(g −1 (A)).
For f ∈ C(λ) and [a, b] ⊂ [0, 1] we denote by C(f ; [a, b]) the set of all continuous maps λ-equivalent to f  [a, b]. We define
C∗ (f ; [a, b]) := {h ∈ C(f ; [a, b]) : h(a) = f (a), h(b) = f (b)}.
Definition 3. Let f be from C(λ) and [a, b] ⊂ [0, 1]. For any fixed m ∈ N, let
us define the map h = hhf ; [a, b], mi : [a, b] → [0, 1] by j ∈ {0, . . . , m − 1} and

Then hhf ; [a, b], mi ∈ C(f ; [a, b]) for each m and hhf ; [a, b], mi ∈ C∗ (f ; [a, b])

the regular 3-fold window perturbation of f by h = hhf ; [a, b], 3i ∈ C∗ (f ; [a, b]).

will be called the window perturbation of f (by h on [a, b]). In particular, if
h = hh[f ; [a, b], mi, m odd, resp. h is piecewise affine, we will speak of regular
m-fold, resp. piecewise affine window perturbation g of f (on [a, b]) - see Figure
1.
The following useful observation will be repeatedly used in our text. We will
omit its proof since it is a straightforward consequence of the uniform continuity of f .
Lemma 5. Let f be from C(λ). For each ε > 0 there is δ > 0 such that
(3)

∀ [a, b] ⊂ [0, 1], b − a < δ ∀ h ∈ C∗ (f ; [a, b]) : ρ(f, ghf, hi) < ε.

In particular, for each ε > 0 there is a positive integer n0 > 0 such that for
each n > n0 , if Ij = [ nj , (j+1)
] and
n
g  Ij = hhf ; Ij , m(j)i
with odd numbers m(j) for every j ∈ {0, . . . , n − 1}, then ρ(f, g) < ε independently of the numbers m(j).
Below we introduce three classical types of mixing in topological dynamics.
We consider them in the context of C(λ).

A map f ∈ C(λ) is called
• transitive if for each pair of nonempty open sets U, V , there is n > 0
such that f n (U ) ∩ V 6= ∅,
• topologicalyl mixing if for each pair of nonempty open sets U, V , there
is n0 ≥ 0 such that f n (U ) ∩ V 6= ∅ for every n > n0 ,
• leo (locally eventually onto) if for every nonempty open set U there is
n ∈ N such that f n (U ) = [0, 1].
For each map f ∈ C(λ) the set of periodic points is dense in [0, 1], this is a consequence of the Poincaré Recurrence Theorem and the fact that in dynamical
system given by an interval map the closures of recurrent points and periodic
points coincide [17]. Thus Proposition 6 and Lemma 7, stated below, apply to
elements of C(λ).
For two intervals J1 , J2 with pairwise disjoint non-empty interiors we write
J1 < J2 if x1 < x2 for some points x1 ∈ J1 and x2 ∈ J2 . Throughout the
article we will denote the interior of an interval J by the notation J ◦ .

J (g) = {Ji }5i=1 , g(Ji ) = Ji for each i.
Proposition 6. [6] Suppose f has a dense set of periodic points. The following
assertions hold (Figure 2).
(i) There is a collection (perhaps finite or empty) J = J (f ) = {J1 , J2 , . . . }
of closed subintervals of [0, 1] with mutually disjoint interiors, such

6

that for each i, f 2 (Ji ) = Ji , and there is a point xi ∈ Ji such that
{f 4n (xi ) : n > 0} is dense in Ji .
(ii) If #J > 2 then either
∀ J1 , J2 ∈ J : J1 < J2 =⇒ f (J1 ) < f (J2 )

(4)
or
(5)

∀ J1 , J2 ∈ J : J1 < J2 =⇒ f (J1 ) > f (J2 ).

(iii) For each J ∈ J , f (J) ∈ J and f −1 (f (J)) = J.
(iv) If (4) is true then f (J) = J for each J ∈ J .
(v) If (5) holds true f (J) = J if and only if J ◦ ∩ Fix(f ) 6= ∅ and there is
at most one such
S interval.
(vi) If x ∈ (0, 1) \ i>1 Ji◦ , then f 2 (x) = x.
(vii) For each J ∈ J , the map f 2  J is topologically mixing.
(viii) For each J ∈ J , if f (J) = J then the map f  J is topologically mixing.
(ix) The map f is surjective.
Proof. Properties (i)-(vi) had been proved in [6]. The other ones easily follow.
(vii) It is well known that an interval map g : J → J is topologically mixing if
and only if g 2 is transitive [8, Theorem 46]. By (i), the set {f 4n (x) : n > 0} is
dense in J for some x ∈ J, hence f 4  J is transitive, i.e., f 2  J is topologically
mixing.
(viii) From (vii) we know that f 2  J is topologically mixing hence also transitive and as in (vii) we can deduce that f  J : J → J is topologically mixing.
(ix) Since f is continuous, the image f ([0, 1]) is a closed interval and by our
assumption it contains a dense subset of [0, 1], so f ([0, 1]) = [0, 1].

Lemma 7. Suppose f has a dense set of periodic points.
(i) The map f is transitive but not topologically mixing if and only if J =
{[0, b], [b, 1]} and f ([0, b]) = [b, 1].
(ii) The map f is topologically mixing if and only if J = {[0, 1]}.
(iii) The map f is leo if and only if J = {[0, 1]} and both of the sets
f −2 (0) ∩ (0, 1) and f −2 (1) ∩ (0, 1) are non-empty.
Proof. Parts (i) and (ii) follow immediately from Proposition 6, thus we begin
by the only if direction of (iii).
By (ii), if J =
6 {[0, 1]} then f is not topologically mixing, and thus not leo,
thus we suppose J = {[0, 1]}. Suppose first that f −2 (0) ∩ (0, 1) = ∅. The leo
map f is continuous and surjective hence every point in (0, 1) must have at
least one preimage in (0, 1). This fact and our assumption f −2 (0) ∩ (0, 1) = ∅
imply f −1 (0) ⊂ {0, 1}.
If f (1) =
6 0 then f −1 (0) = {0} and 0 ∈
/ f n ((0, 1]) for every n positive. If
f (1) = 0 then by our assumption, f −1 (1) ∩ (0, 1) = ∅ hence f (0) = 1. It

implies that f 2 (0) = 0, f 2 (1) = 1 and 0 ∈
/ f 2n ((0, 1]), what contradicts the leo
−2
property of f . The case when f (1) ∩ (0, 1) = ∅ can be proven analogously.
We turn to the if direction. We assume that J = {[0, 1]} and that f −2 (0) ∩
(0, 1) 6= ∅ 6= f −2 (1) ∩ (0, 1) = ∅; since by (ii) f is topologically mixing, for
every nonempty open L ⊂ [0, 1] there has to exist a positive n for which
f n (L) ∩ f −2 (0) 6= ∅ =
6 f n (L) ∩ f −2 (1) hence f n+2 (L) = [0, 1].

For any set X ⊂ C([0, 1]) we denote by Xproperty the set of all maps in X having
a property (in lower index abbreviated) in question. We denote by P A(λ) the
set of all piecewise affine maps from C(λ).
Proposition 8. The set P A(λ)leo is dense in C(λ).
Proof. Fix an f ∈ C(λ) and ε > 0. It had been shown in [11] that there exists
a map d? ∈ P A(λ) such that ρ(d? , f ) < ε.
Let us show with the help of Lemma 5 that there exists a map d?? ∈ P A(λ)leo
for which ρ(d?? , d? ) < ε. First we prove
Claim. P A(λ)leo = P A(λ)tmix .
Proof of Claim. Any leo map is topologically mixing. So let f ∈ P A(λ)tmix and
show that f ∈ P A(λ)leo . If f −1 (0) ∩ (0, 1) = f −1 (1) ∩ (0, 1) = ∅, then since f
is surjective either f −1 (0) = {0}, f −1 (1) = {1} or f −1 (0) = {1} and f −1 (1) =
{0}. But f ∈ C(λ), so f 0 ≡ 1 on some neighborhood of {0, 1} in the first case
or f 0 ≡ −1 on some neighborhood of {0, 1} in the latter case - a contradiction
with topological mixing of f . So assume that f −1 (0) ∩ (0, 1) 6= ∅. As in the
proof of Lemma 7, since f is continuous and surjective, f −2 (0) ∩ (0, 1) 6= ∅
and by Lemma 7(iii), it is sufficient to show that f −2 (1) ∩ (0, 1) 6= ∅, resp.
f −1 (1) ∩ (0, 1) 6= ∅. Let f −1 (1) ∩ (0, 1) = ∅. We are done if {0} ⊂ f −1 (1), since
then f −2 (1)∩(0, 1)∩f −1 (0) 6= ∅. It remains to comment the case f −1 (1) = {1}.
Then since f ∈ C(λ), f 0 ≡ 1 on some neighborhood of 1 - a contradiction with
topological mixing of f . The case when f −1 (1) ∩ (0, 1) 6= ∅ can be captured
analogously. This finishes the proof of the claim.
By our claim we are done if d? ∈ P A(λ)tmix , so assume that this is not the
case. Notice that since d? is piecewise affine, the set J (d? ) is a finite
S set,
J (d? ) = {Ji : i = 1, . . . , k} with 2 6 k < ∞, and thus the set [0, 1] \ J (d? )
has a finite number of connected components, each one is an interval. Without
loss of generality we can assume that each of these intervals is reduced to a
single point (if it were not the case, we could use Proposition 6 and a finite
number of regular m-fold, m > 3, piecewise affine window perturbations on a
finite collection of sufficiently small adjacent subintervals of those connected
components as described in Lemma 5 - see Figure 3(Left)). Let J = [a, b] and
J 0 = [b, c] be two adjacent element of J (d? ) - see Figure 3(Right).

• Using a piecewise affine window perturbation (not necessarily regular)
on some neighborhood of b if necessary, w.l.o.g. we can assume that d?
is strictly monotone with a constant slope on neighborhood U1 (b) of b.
• Choosing sufficiently small ε1 < ε we can consider the regular 3-fold
window perturbation of d? on U2 (b) ⊂ U1 (b) resulting in the map
d?1 ∈ P A(λ) satisfying ρ(d? , d?1 ) < ε1 . Moreover, by Proposition 6

Summarizing, from Lemma 7(iii) we obtain that d?? = d?` is topologically


Theorem 9. The C(λ)-typical function is leo.
Proof. By Proposition 8 we can fix a countable dense collection {fn }n from
P A(λ)leo . Using a 2-fold piecewise affine window perturbation of fn on [0, ε],
resp. [1 − ε, 1] if necessary - see Example 3 and Lemma 5 - without loss of
generality we can assume that for each n ∈ N we have fn (0) ∈ (0, 1) and
fn (1) ∈ (0, 1).
Let B(g, ε) := {f ∈ C(λ) : ρ(f, g) < ε}. For a given sequence {εn : εn > 0}n
which we will choose later, we consider the dense Gδ set
\ [
G :=
B(fn , εn ).
N >1 n>N

We claim that we can choose εn in such a way that any f ∈ G is leo.
Consider a sequence (Jm )m∈N of all open rational subintervals of (0, 1). For
j(n,m)
each n, m there is a j(n, m) ∈ N such that fn
(Jm ) = [0, 1]. Choose εn > 0
so small so that for all f ∈ B(fn , εn ) we have f j(n,m) (Jm ) ⊃ (1/n, 1 − 1/n)
for m = 1, 2, . . . , n. Additionally we assume that εn > 0 is so small that
f (0) ∈ (0, 1) and f (1) ∈ (0, 1).
Now consider an f ∈ G. Then there exists an infinite sequence (nk )k∈N so that
f ∈ B(fnk , εnk ). By Proposition 6(ix) the map f is surjective. Thus there are
points a, b ∈ [0, 1] such that f (a) = 0 and f (b) = 1. By the choice of εn we
have such points a, b ∈ (0, 1).
Fix an open interval J ⊂ [0, 1]. Choose an m so that Jm ⊂ J. Suppose nk
satisfies the following conditions (i) nk > m and (ii) a, b ∈ (1/nk , 1 − 1/nk ).
Assume a < b, the other case being similar. By construction of G and the
above two assumptions we have
f j(nk ,m) (J) ⊃ f j(nk ,m) (Jm ) ⊃ (1/nk , 1 − 1/nk ) ⊃ [a, b].
Thus f j(nk ,m)+1 (J) ⊃ f ([a, b]) = [0, 1].

For integers a > b > 0 let f [a,b] (x) := {f j (x) : a 6 j 6 b}. A family of

for 2 6 i 6 n. We say that a specification {f [aj ,bj ] (xj )}nj=1 is ε-shadowed by
y ∈ [0, 1] if
d(f k (y), f k (xi )) 6 ε for ai 6 k 6 bi and 1 6 i 6 n.
We say that f has the specification property if for any ε > 0 there is a constant N = N (ε) such that any N -spaced specification {f [aj ,bj ] (xj )}nj=1 is εshadowed by some y ∈ [0, 1]. If additionally, y can be chosen in such a way
that f bn −a0 +N (y) = y then f has the periodic specification property.
Applying a result of Blokh [10] we obtain
Corollary 10. The C(λ)-typical function satisfies the periodic specification
property.

3. Mixing properties in C(λ)
We start by introducing three classical types of mixing in a measure-theoretical
dynamics [34]. We state them in the context of C(λ).
Definition 11. A map f ∈ C(λ) is called
(i) ergodic, if for every A, B ∈ B,
n−1

λ(f −j (A) ∩ B) = λ(A)λ(B).

n→∞ n
j=0
lim

(iii) strongly mixing, if for every A, B ∈ B,
lim λ(f −j (A) ∩ B) = λ(A)λ(B).

n→∞

Analogously as before, for a subset X ⊂ C(λ) we denote by Xslope>1 the set of
all maps f from X for which |f 0 (x)| > 1 for all x ∈ [0, 1] at which derivative
of f exists.
We denote by P AM (λ) the set of all piecewise affine Markov maps in P A(λ),
i.e., maps for which all points of discontinuity of the derivative and also both
endpoints 0, 1 are eventually periodic.
Proposition 12. The set P AM (λ)leo is dense in C(λ).

TYPICAL PROPERTIES OF INTERVAL MAPS

Proof. Let f ∈ P A(λ)leo , fix ε > 0. Denote R(f ) the set containing {0, 1} and
all points of discontinuity of the derivative of f , let S(f ) ⊂ R(f ) be eventually
periodic points from R(f ) and T (f ) = R(f ) \ S(f ).
Clearly the set R(f ) is finite. Fix t ∈ T = T (f ). By Proposition 6(ix) and
Lemma 5 we can consider a periodic orbit P = {p1 < · · · < pk } of f such that
for some three consecutive points pi−1 < pi < pi+1
• f  [pi−1 , pi+1 ] is affine,
• orb(S(f ), f ) ∩ [pi−1 , pi+1 ] = ∅,
• every window perturbation of f by h ∈ C(f ; [pi−1 , pi+1 ]) on [pi−1 , pi+1 ]
is ε/m-close to f , where m = #T ,
• every piecewise affine window perturbation of f on [pi−1 , pi+1 ] belongs
to P A(λ)leo ,
• orb(t, f ) ∩ (pi−1 , pi+1 ) 6= ∅.
Let f ` (t) be the first iterate of t in (pi−1 , pi+1 ). By Lemma 5 there exists a
5-fold piecewise affine window perturbation (not necessarily regular) g1 of f
by h on [pi−1 , pi+1 ] satisfying
g1 (f ` (t)) = g1 (pi ) = f (pi ).
Then #R(g1 ) = #R(f ) + 6 and #S(g1 ) > #S(f ) + 7 hence
#T (f ) − 1 = m − 1 = #R(f ) + 6 − (#S(f ) + 7) >
> #R(g1 ) − #S(g1 ) = #T (g1 ).
Repeating the above procedure maximally m = #T -times, we obtain the required Markov map g ∈ P AM (λ)leo .

Let f be from P AM (λ)slope>1 with a Markov partition
A = {A0 = [x0 , x1 ] 6 · · · 6 AN −1 = [xN −1 , xN ]},
where the set Pf = {0 = x0 < · · · < xN = 1} contains orbits of all points of
discontinuity of derivative of f and of the endpoints. To each point x ∈ [0, 1]
we associate its itinerary Φ(x) = (φi (x))i>0 with respect to A, i.e., φi (x) ∈
{0, 1, . . . , N − 1} and f i (x) ∈ Aφi (x) for each i > 0 (in this settings Φ is a oneto-finite multivalued map). Since f is continuous, the system (Φ([0, 1]), σ) is a
subshift of the full shift ({0, 1, . . . , N −1}N0 , σ) on the symbols {0, 1, . . . , N −1}
[34].
Any map from P AM (λ)leo satisfies the hypothesis
T of [5, Theorem 3.2]. So any
such map is in fact exact, i.e., for every A ∈ n>0 T −n (B), λ(A)λ(Ac ) = 0.
It is known that every exact map has one-sided countable Lebesgue spectrum
and hence is strongly mixing [34, p. 115]. For our purpose it will be convenient
to prove explicitly the following.

Lemma 13. Let f be from P AM (λ)slope>1 , consider A and Φ as above. The
system ([0, 1], B, λ, f ) is isomorphic to the one-sided Markov shift (Φ([0, 1])), B 0 , µ, σ),
where the measure µ on the Borel σ-algebra B 0 is given by the probability vector
(6)

p = (λ(A0 ), . . . , λ(AN −1 ))

−1
and the stochastic matrix P = (pij )N
i,j=0 , where
( λ(A )
j
, f (Ai ) ⊃ Aj
λ(f (Ai ))
.
(7)
pij =
0,
otherwise

In particular every map from P AM (λ)leo is strongly mixing.
Proof. For the definition of isomorphic measure theoretic systems see [34, Definition 2.4]. Clearly, the vector p is a probability vector and, since f ∈ C(λ)
with constant derivative on each Ai , the matrix P is stochastic and pP = p.
So the measure µ is defined well on the Borel σ-algebra B 0 generated by the
cylinders in Φ([0, 1]). Since f ∈ P AM (λ)slope>1 , Φ is injective. Let N be
the set of those points x from [0, 1] for which the set Φ(x) consists of more
itineraries. Then N is countable and, since Φ is a one-to-finite multivalued
map, the set Φ(N ) is also countable. Hence Φ : [0, 1] \ N → Φ([0, 1] \ N ) is a
bijection and λ([0, 1] \ N ) = µ(Φ([0, 1] \ N )) = 1. Obviously,
Φ ◦ f = σ ◦ Φ on [0, 1] \ N.
To finish the proof we need to show that
λ(Φ−1 (A)) = µ(A) for each A ∈ B 0 .
Obviously it is sufficient to verify the last equality for cylinders, i.e., the sets
Cφ0 ,...,φk−1 = {(φi (x))i>0 ∈ φ([0, 1]) : φ0 (x) = φ0 , . . . , φk−1 (x) = φk−1 },
where k ∈ N and φ0 , . . . , φk−1 ∈ {0, . . . , N − 1}. By the definition of the
Markov shift
k−1
Y λ(Aφj )
µ(Cφ0 ,...,φk−1 ) = λ(Aφ0 )
= ♣,
λ(f (Aφj−1 ))
j=1
where the second factor equals to one if k = 1. Since f has a constant derivative
on each Ai ,
♣ = λ(Φ−1 (Cφ0 ,...,φk )).
If f ∈ P AM (λ)leo ∩ P AM (λ)slope>1 , the matrix P is irreducible and aperiodic,
hence
(Φ([0, 1])), B 0 , µ, σ)
is strogly mixing [34, Theorem 1.31]. By the previous, it is also true for
isomorphic ([0, 1], B, λ, f ).

Corollary 14. The set C(λ)smix of strongly mixing maps is dense in C(λ).

TYPICAL PROPERTIES OF INTERVAL MAPS

Proof. It is a consequence of Proposition 12 and Lemma 13.

Theorem 15. C(λ)-typical function is weakly mixing.
Proof. By Proposition 12 and Lemma 13 we can consider a countable dense
set {fn }n of weakly mixing maps. Suppose εn are strictly positive. Let
\ [
G :=
B(fn , εn ).
N >1 n>N

Clearly G is a dense Gδ . We will show that the εi can be chosen in such a way
that all the configurations in G are weakly mixing.
Let {hj }j>1 be a countable, dense collection of continuous functions in L1 (X ×
X). For any f ∈ C(λ) and ` > 1, let
S`f hj (x, y)

`−1

1X
hj (f × f )k (x, y) .
:=
` k=0

The map f is weakly mixing if and only if the map f × f is ergodic, and by
the Birkhoff ergodic theorem, the map f × f is ergodic if and only if we have
Z
f
hj (s, t) d(λ(s) × λ(t))
lim S` hj (x) =
`→∞

X×X

for all j > 1.
For each n since fn is weakly mixing, there exists a set Bn ⊂ X × X and a
positive integer `n such that λ(Bn ) > 1 − 1i and
Z
1
fn
hj (s, t) d(λ(s) × λ(t)) <
S`n hj (x, y) −
i
X×X
for all (x, y) ∈ Bn , 1 6 j 6 n. We can assume that limn→∞ `n = ∞.
Now we would like to extend these estimates to the neighborhood B(fn , εn ) for
a sufficiently small strictly positive εn . By the triangular inequality we have:
R
S`gn hj (x, y) − X×X hj (s, t) d(λ(s) × λ(t)) 6
R
S`gn hj (x, y) − S`fnn hj (x, y) + S`fnn hj (x, y) − X×X hj (s, t) d(λ(s) × λ(t)) .
For any point (x, y), and any ` > 1 the point g ` (x, y) varies continuously with
g in a small neighborhood of fn ; thus we can find εn > 0, and a set B̂n ⊂ Bn
of measure larger than 1 − 2i so that if g ∈ B(fn , εn ), then
Z

g
S`n hj (x, y) −

for all (x, y) ∈ B̂n , 1 6 j 6 i.

For each g ∈ G there is an infinite sequence nk such that g ∈ B(fnk , εnk ).

Consider B(g) = ∞

i=M B̂nk . Since λ(B̂nk ) > 1 − nk , it follows that

We can thus conclude that for λ-a.e. (x, y), for all j > 1,

Definition 16. We say a piecewise monotone map f : [0, 1] → [0, 1] is expanding if there is a constant c > 1 such that |f (x) − f (y)| > c|x − y| whenever x
and y lie in the same monotone piece. If f is expanding Markov and a finite
set Pf = {x0 < · · · < xN } contains orbits of all points of discontinuity of the
derivative and also of the endpoints 0, 1, we let P ∗ = {0, . . . , N } and define
f ∗ : P ∗ → P ∗ by f ∗ (i) = j if f (xi ) = xj .
Remark S
17. The set P from Definition 16 is not uniquely determined. Any
0
set P = nk=0 f −k (P ), n ∈ N, is also a finite set that contains orbits of all
points of discontinuity of the derivative and also of the endpoints 0, 1.
Theorem 18. [9, Theorem 2.1] Expanding Markov maps f and g are topologically conjugate via an increasing homeomorphism h if and only if f ∗ = g ∗ . In
this case h(Pf ) = Pg , where g = h ◦ f ◦ h−1 .
The next part of this paragraph will be devoted to the strong mixing maps in
C(λ). We start with one useful lemma.
Lemma 19. Let f be from P AM (λ)leo . For each ε > 0 there exists a strongly
mixing measure µ 6= λ preserved by the map f and a homeomorphism h : [0, 1] →
[0, 1] such that for ν = (µ + λ)/2
λ = h∗ ν, i.e., g = h ◦ f ◦ h−1 ∈ C(λ) and ||f − g|| < ε.
Proof. Consider the Markov partition
A = {A0 = [x0 , x1 ] 6 · · · 6 AN −1 = [xN −1 , xN ]}
for f , where the set Pf = {0 = x0 < · · · < xN = 1} contains all orbits of points
of discontinuity of derivative of f and of the endpoints. Using Definition 16
and Remark 17 we can assume that for some {xi−1 < xi < xi+1 } ⊂ Pf there
are points {x`−1 < x` < x`+1 6 xr−1 < xr < xr+1 } ⊂ Pf such that
f ({x`−1 , x`+1 }) = f ({xr−1 , xr+1 }) = {xi−1 , xi+1 }, f (x` ) = f (xr ) = xi
and
(9)

f −1 (x` ) ∩ Pf = ∅ = f −1 (xr ) ∩ Pf .

The last conditions in (9) imply that for every Aj ∈ A and s ∈ {`, r}

TYPICAL PROPERTIES OF INTERVAL MAPS

15

∅=
6 f (Aj ) ∩ (As−1 ∪ As )◦ =⇒ f (Aj ) ⊃ As−1 ∪ As ,

(10)

where as before J ◦ denotes the interior of an interval J.
In what follows we introduce a map α from P AM (λ)leo such that Pα differs
from Pf only in the points x` , xr . Fix δ > 0. We can consider δ1 ∈ (0, δ) and
Pα = {y0 < · · · < y`−1 < y` < y`+1 6 yr−1 < yr < yr+1 < · · · < yN }
satisfying
• xi = yi for i ∈
/ {`, r} and 0 < |x` − y` | < δ1 , 0 < |xr − yr | < δ1 ,
• α̃(yi ) = yj if and only if f (xi ) = xj
• the connect-the-dots map α extending α̃ from the set Pα to the whole
interval [0, 1] satisfies α ∈ P AM (λ)leo .
Since both maps f and α are expanding, by (10) also Markov and f ∗ = α∗ ,
from Theorem 18 we obtain that α = h1 ◦f ◦h−1
1 with h1 (Pf ) = Pα . By Remark
17 we can consider the set Pf δ-dense in [0, 1] hence the homeomorphism h1
fulfils 0 < ||h1 − id|| < 2δ.
By Lemma 13 the map α with respect to λ is measure isomorphic to a one-sided
Markov shift given by the probability vector q = (λ([y0 , y1 ]), . . . , λ([yN −1 , yN ]))
−1
and the stochastic matrix Q = (qij )N
i,j=0 , where
( λ([y ,y ])
j−1 j
, α([yi−1 , yi ]) ⊃ [yj−1 , yj ]
.
(11)
qij = λ(α([yi−1 ,yi ]))
0,
otherwise
∗
Since α = h1 ◦ f ◦ h−1
1 , the measure µ 6= λ (for h1 (y` ) 6= x` ) given by λ = h1 µ
is a strongly mixing measure preserved by the map f . It follows that the
measure ν = µ+λ
, as a convex combination of two strongly mixing measures,
2
is a nonergodic measure with supp ν = [0, 1] and preserved by the map f . Let
us consider a homeomorphism h : [0, 1] → [0, 1] defined by

λ = h∗ ν.
Then from |h1 (x) − x| < 2δ fulfilling for each x ∈ [0, 1] we obtain
µ([0, x]) + x
h1 (x) + x
=
< x + δ,
2
2
i.e., ||h − id|| < δ. Now, taking δ sufficiently small we obtain
x − δ < ν([0, x]) = h(x) =

g = h ◦ f ◦ h−1 ∈ C(λ) and ||f − g|| < ε.

Theorem 20. The set of all strongly mixing maps in C(λ) is of the first
category.

JOZEF BOBOK AND SERGE TROUBETZKOY

C(λ). Then

where
Fε,A,B,k = {f ∈ C(λ) : |λ(f −k (A) ∩ B) − λ(A)λ(B)| 6 ε}.
is a closed set for each pair A, B ∈ B. Using Propositions 12 and Corollary 14
we can consider a dense sequence {fj }j of piecewise affine leo, strongly mixing
maps in C(λ).
For a positive sequence {εm }m converging to 0 and a map fj let us denote µj,m ,
hj,m , νj,m = (µj,m + λ)/2 all objects guaranteed in Lemma 19(ii) for f = fj and
ε = εm . Since each µj,m is orthogonal to λ, T
there is a Borel set Aj,m satisfying
λ(Aj,m ) = 1 and µj,m (Aj,m ) = 0. Put A = j,m Aj,m . Then λ(A) = 1 and we
can write for the map gj,m = hj,m ◦ fj ◦ h−1
j,m ∈ C(λ) and each k ∈ N

It shows that the closed set F1/5,A,A,k is nowhere dense for each k hence by

The following theorem states a general result analogous to one of V. Jarnı́k
[22]. Recall that by a knot point of function f we mean a point x where
D+ f (x) = D− f (x) = ∞ and D+ f (x) = D− f (x) = −∞.
Theorem 21. [11] C(λ)-typical function has a knot point at λ-almost every
point.
Corollary 22. The C(λ)-typical function maps a set of Lebesgue measure zero
onto [0, 1].
Proof. Let K be the set of knot points of f . Each level set contains its maximum, it cannot be a knot point. Thus f (K c ) = [0, 1].

It is an interesting question if functions from C(λ) with knot points λ-almost
everywhere have infinite topological entropy.
4. Metric entropy in C(λ)
We start this section by an easy application of the Rohlin entropy formula (see
for example Theorem 1.9.7 in [28]).

Lemma 23. Let f be from P A(λ). Then
Z 1
log |f 0 (x)| dλ(x).
hλ (f ) =
0

It follows from [34, Corollary 4.14.3] that if f ∈ C(λ) \ {id, 1 − id} then
hλ (f ) > 0. Analogously as before, for c ∈ (0, ∞] and X ⊂ C(λ) we denote by
Xentr<c , resp. Xentr=c the set of all maps f from X for which hλ (f ) < c, resp.
hλ (f ) = c.
Proposition 24. For every c ∈ (0, ∞) the set P AM (λ)entr=c is dense in C(λ).
Proof. We claim that for each ε > 0
(14) ∀ f ∈ P A(λ)slope>1 ∀ δ > 0 : B(f ; δ) ∩ P A(λ)entr<ε ∩ P A(λ)slope>1 6= ∅.
In order to verify (14) we will proceed in several steps. In the first step we
show that in C(λ) any piecewise affine map with full laps can be approximated
by a piecewise affine map with exactly two distinct slopes and of arbitrarily
small metric entropy; in the second step we generalize our construction to
any piecewise affine map. In the third step we prove the statement of the
proposition.
I. Let F : [0, 1] → [0, 1] be a continuous piecewise affine map with m > 1 full
laps, i.e., for which there are points 0 = x0 < x1 < · · · < xm = 1 such that
F  [xi , xxi+1 ], i = 0, . . . , m − 1, is affine and F ([xi , xxi+1 ]) = [0, 1] for each i.
Clearly F ∈ P AM (λ)slope>1 and |F 0 (x)| = 1/αi for αi = λ([xi , xi+1 ]) and each
x ∈ (xi , xi+1 ). In fact the map F is uniquely determined by the (m + 1)-tuple
(±, α0 , . . . , αm−1 ) (we write F ∼ (+, α0 , . . . , αm−1 )) satisfying

of H(η, M ) equals c.
II. Fix f ∈ P A(λ)slope>1 , let 0 = y0 < · · · < yn = 1 be such that (yj , yj+1 ),
j = 0, . . . , n − 1, are the maximal open intervals on which the map

is constant. This map is well defined since f is piecewise affine with (absolute)
slopes greater than 1. Let us denote αij , i = 0, . . . , mj − 1, the Lebesgue
measure of the ith (from the left) connected components of f −1 ((yj , yj+1 ));
Fix the vector of mj ’s and n as above, and consider the system of equations

yj are rational for all i, j. Each such solution corresponds to a map in C(λ),
thus wlog we can replace f by a close “rational” map.

composed from hi , i = 0, . . . , mj − 1 and we can use those maps to approximate the map f by the uniquely determined map H = H[η, M ] : [0, 1] → [0, 1]
in the following way.
Let Cij denote the ith connected component of f −1 ([yj , yj+1 ]). Remember
from step I that the graph of H (j) is produced by gluing various horizontally
(j)
shifted copies of hi . The graph of H is produced by gluing various copies of
the same pieces, but with different vertical (with respect to j) and horizontal
(j)
(j)
(with respect to Cij ) shifts. More precisely the copies of Hi := hi + yj are
glued in the same combinatorial order of the interval Cij , i.e., the rightmost
(j)
value (either yj or yj+1 ) of preceding Hi coincides with the leftmost value of
0
(j )
the following Hi0 .
Note that H[η, M ] ∈ P A(λ)slope>1 , Equality (16) holds,
hλ (H[η, M ]) → 0 for η → 0+
and
ρ(f, H[η, M ]) → 0 for η → 0+ and M → ∞.
As in part I, for each M , for any c ∈ (0, log(m − 1)) there is an η such that
the entropy of H(η, M ) equals c. In particular, the proof of (14) is finished.
III. Fix a map f ∈ P A(λ)slope>1 and ε and δ positive. Using part II, for a
sufficiently small η and large M , the map H = H[η, M ] ∈ P A(λ)slope>1 satisfies

If H is not Markov, we can use sufficiently small window perturbations of the
piecewise affine map H analogous to the ones from the proofs of Propositions
8 and 12 to obtain H̃ ∈ P AM (λ)slope>1 still satisfying
Z 1
log |H̃ 0 (x)| dλ(x) < ε.
ρ(f, H̃) < δ, hλ (H̃) =
0

Let S = S(H̃) be the set consisting of all orbits of points of discontinuity of
the derivative of H̃ and also both endpoints 0, 1. Since H̃ is Markov, S is finite
and there exists a periodic orbit P and its two consecutive points p, p0 ∈ P
such that [p, p0 ] ∩ S = ∅, (i.e., H̃  [p, p0 ] is affine) and, p and p0 are so close that
using Lemma 5, for every m > 3 any m-fold piecewise affine perturbation (not
necessarily regular) of H̃ on [p, p0 ] is still from B(f ; δ). Notice that each such
perturbation Ĥ is again from P AM (λ)slope>1 hence by Lemma 23 the entropy
is given by the integral formula and

i
• hλ (Ĥ) ∈ hλ (H̃), hλ (H̃) + (log m)(p0 − p) ,

TYPICAL PROPERTIES OF INTERVAL MAPS

• Lemma 23 implies that the entropy hλ (Ĥ) is a continuous function
of the slopes of the affine pieces of iĤ  [p, p0 ] and that each value
from hλ (H̃), hλ (H̃) + (log m)(p0 − p) is the entropy of some piecewise
affine m-fold perturbation Ĥ of H̃ on [p, p0 ]
To see that for every c ∈ (0, ∞) the set P AM (λ)entr=c is dense in C(λ), we
proceed as follows. As mentioned in the beginning of the proof of Proposition
8 P A(λ) is dense in C(λ). For each f ∈ P A(λ) the slope of each affine piece
is at least one, using a window perturbation we can make an arbitrarily small
perturbation replacing these affine pieces with ones whose slopes are strictly
greater than one, obtaining that P A(λ)slope>1 is dense in C(λ).
Fix c and an g ∈ C(λ), choose f ∈ P A(λ)slope>1 arbitrarily close to g. By
Equation (14) we can find a H ∈ P A(λ)slope>1 arbitrarily close of g with
entropy strictly less than c. The above construction yields Markov map H̃
with small entropy, and for large enough m it yields a Markov map Ĥ with
entropy exactly c.

Proposition 25. The set C(λ)entr=+∞ is dense in C(λ).
Proof. We proceed like in the proof of the previous lemma. We fix g ∈ C(λ),
and we repeat steps I and II, and then in step III we realize a sequence of
window perturbations: sequences (Hn )n>1 , ([pn , p0n ])n>1 and (mn )n>1 such that
for each n,
•
•
•

•

[pn , p0n ] ⊃ [pn+1 , p0n+1 ],
Hn+1 is a mn -fold window perturbation of Hn on [pn , p0n ],
Hn ∈ P AM (λ)slope>1 ,
hλ (Hn ) = hλ (Hn , An ) > n, where An is a Markov partition for Hn ,
for some H∞ ∈ B(g; δ), ρ(Hn , H∞ ) → 0 for n → ∞,
hλ (H∞ , An ) > hλ (Hn , An ) > n hence hλ (H∞ ) = ∞.


For completeness we prove the following fact, which is well known in many
situations.
Proposition 26. The set C(λ)htop =∞ is a dense Gδ subset of C(λ).
Proof. Every map f ∈ C(λ) \ {id}, has a fixed point b where the graph of f
is transverse to the diagonal at b. Using an (n + 2)-fold window perturbation
on a neighborhood of b, we can create a map g ∈ C(λ) arbitrarily close to f
with a horseshoe with entropy log n in the window. Since horseshoes are stable
under perturbations, there is an open ball B(g, δ) such that each h in this ball
has topological entropy at least log n for any n > 1.
