Two different versions of an optical theorem for a scattering body embedded inside a lossy background medium are derived in this paper. The corresponding fundamental upper bounds on absorption are then obtained in closed form by elementary optimization techniques. The first version is
formulated in terms of polarization currents (or equivalent currents) inside the scatterer and generalizes previous results given for a lossless medium. The corresponding bound is referred to here as a
variational bound and is valid for an arbitrary geometry with a given material property. The second
version is formulated in terms of the T-matrix parameters of an arbitrary linear scatterer circumscribed by a spherical volume and gives a new fundamental upper bound on the total absorption of
an inclusion with an arbitrary material property (including general bianisotropic materials). The
two bounds are fundamentally different as they are based on different assumptions regarding the
structure and the material property. Numerical examples including homogeneous and layered (coreshell) spheres are given to demonstrate that the two bounds provide complimentary information in
a given scattering problem.

INTRODUCTION

Fundamental limits on the scattering and absorption in resonant electromagnetic structures have been
considered in various formulations and applications
such as with small dipole scatterers55 , antennas16,51 ,
radar absorbers45 , high-impedance surfaces15 , passive
metamaterials49,52 and optical systems30,34,48 . Notably,
these problems are almost always formulated for a lossless background medium such as vacuum. In most cases
there are very good reasons for doing this, at least
when the background losses are sufficiently small. In
fact, it turns out that the presence of the lossy background medium not only implies an obstructive complication of the analytical derivations, it also nullifies the
validity of many powerful theorems and constraints, see
e.g.,5,12,13,23,32,33,38,39,53,54,61 with references. In essence,
the problem is that any optical theorem for a scattering
body embedded in a lossy medium will depend on the
geometry of the scatterer. A vivid illustration of this
is the optical theorem and the associated upper bounds
on dipole scattering and absorption of a small (dipole)
scatterer in a lossless medium which are based solely
on the polarizability of the scatterer55 , and which no
longer is valid for a lossy background33,39,61 . Hence, for
a lossy background medium the associated optical theorems must be modified, and it can be expected that any
analytical results regarding the optimal absorption will
become dependent on the geometry of the scatterer, see
e.g.,38,39 .

There is a number of application areas where the surrounding losses clearly cannot be neglected. This includes typically medical applications such as localized
electrophoretic heating of a bio-targeted and electrically charged gold nanoparticle suspension as a radiotherapeutic hyperthermia-based method to treat cancer,
cf.,8–10,37,46 . Corresponding applications in the optical
domain are concerned with light in biological tissue11 ,
and the use of gold nanoparticles for plasmonic photothermal therapy19 . Surface-enhanced biological sensing with molecular monolayer spectroscopy is another
related application, see e.g.,26 . In photonic applications
and in plasmonics, dielectric substrates based on polymeric media are usually considered to be lossless at optical frequencies21,43 . However, some of the substances
that are used can also show significant losses such as
with z-doped PMMA materials3 . Another important
medical application is concerned with implantable antennas that are used in telemetry applications as a part
of communication link of health-monitoring and healthcare systems28,50 . The presence of losses in the background medium affects the reliability of such links, especially the performance of in-body antennas. In this
application, however, the aim is to reduce the amount
of power absorbed by a human body, and this can be
achieved by encapsulation of the implant by a biocompatible insulator29 . Finally, we mention the terrestrial
gaseous atmosphere which has a diversity of rotationalvibrational absorption bands ranging from microwave
to optical frequencies14,24 . Important applications in-

2
clude antennas and short range communications at 60
GHz18,27,42,56,58 (absorption bands of oxygen) as well as
the study of radiative transfer in the presence of aerosols
and cloud particles in the atmosphere24,32 .
In this paper we present two different versions of an optical theorem and the associated absorption bounds for
a scattering body embedded inside a lossy background
medium. These versions are based on the interior and
the exterior fields, i.e., the equivalent (polarization) currents inside the scatterer and the T-matrix parameters
of the scatterer, respectively. The two versions of the optical theorem express the same power balance, and yet
they are fundamentally different (and hence complimentary), since they are based on different assumptions regarding the properties of the scatterer. The first version
is an extension to lossy media regarding the absorption
bounds given in30 , and is valid for an arbitrary geometry
with a given material property. Even though the basic
optimization technique is the same as in30 , it is demonstrated how the seemingly trivial extension to lossy media insidiously requires a careful analysis where it is not
sufficient just to replace a real-valued wave number for a
complex-valued one. In particular, the new optical theorem shows that the extinct power must be expressed as
an affine form in the equivalent currents implying subtle changes in the final form of the fundamental bound
on absorption. The second version is a refinement of the
fundamental bounds on multipole absorption given in38 ,
and is valid for a spherical geometry with an arbitrary
material property. In particular, we formulate an optical theorem and derive the associated absorption bound
for the total fields including all the electric and magnetic multipoles. It is proved that the bound is valid not
only for a rotationally invariant sphere as in38 , but also
for general heterogeneous bianisotropic materials. We
prove also that the new bound, which is given by a multipole summation formula, is convergent whenever there
are non-zero losses in the exterior domain. In this way,
the results also provide a new way to determine the number of useful multipoles in a given scattering problem,
i.e., as a function of the electrical size of the scatterer as
well as of the losses in the exterior domain. Through the
numerical examples, we show that the new fundamental
bounds give complementary information on the absorption of scattering objects in lossy media. The derived
bounds are applicable for arbitrary objects made of arbitrary materials, which gives a possibility to find such an
electrically small structure that has an absorption peak
close to the fundamental bounds.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section
II is given the optical theorem based on the interior fields
and in Section III the corresponding bounds on absorption by variational calculus. In Section IV, we consider
the optical theorem and the associated bounds based on
the exterior fields using the T-matrix formalism. In Section V is illustrated the numerical examples, and the paper is summarized in Section VI. Finally, in Appendix A
is shown the derivation of the maximal absorbed power

based on calculus of variations, and in Appendix B is
put the most important definitions and formulas that are
used regarding the spherical vector wave expansion.

The electric and magnetic field intensities E and H
are given in SI-units20 and the time convention for time
harmonic fields (phasors) is given by e−iωt , where ω is
the angular frequency and t the time. Let µ0 , 0 , η0 and
c0 denote the permeability, the permittivity, the wave

Extinction, scattering and absorption

Consider a scattering problem consisting of a scattering body V bounded by the surface ∂V and which is
embedded in an infinite homogeneous and isotropic background medium having relative permeability µb and relative permittivity b , see Fig. 1. The scatterer V consists of a linear material bounded by a finite open set
with volume denoted by the same letter V . The background medium also consists of a passive material and
hence Im{µb } ≥ 0 and Im{b } ≥ 0. The incident (i)
and scattered (s) fields satisfy the following Maxwell’s
equations with respect to the background medium
(
∇ × E{i,s} = ik0 η0 µb H{i,s} ,
(1)
∇ × H{i,s} = −ik0 η0−1 b E{i,s} ,
in the exterior region R3 \ V and the total fields are denoted E = Ei + Es and H = Hi + Hs . It is noted that
the incident fields satisfy (1) in the whole of R3 .
The interior scattering medium is characterized by the
following constitutive relations for a general bianisotropic
linear material
(
D = 0  · E + c10 χem · H,
(2)
B = c10 χme · E + µ0 µ · H,
where B is the magnetic flux density and D the electric
flux density and where the relative permittivity and permeability dyadics are  = b I + χee and µ = µb I + χmm ,
respectively, and where χee , χmm , χem and χme are
dimensionless susceptibility dyadics. By following the

It is noted that (12) through (18) generalizes previous
expressions which have been given for a lossless exterior
medium30 (Eqs. (4) through (7) on p. 3338) where Pi = 0,
and both Ma and Mt given above can be replaced by the
susceptibility dyadic χ.
It is observed that Pa is represented by a positive definite (strictly convex) quadratic form and Pt by an affine
form in the field quantities. Note in particular the additional power balancing term −2Pi that is present in (13).
Finally, it is noted that in the present formulation it is
sufficient to derive three terms as in (12) through (14)
since the fourth term Ps will then be given by the optical
theorem (6).
III. FUNDAMENTAL BOUNDS ON
ABSORPTION BY VARIATIONAL CALCULUS

The fundamental bounds on absorption derived in30
are generalized below for the case with a lossy background medium. The derivation is based on the optical
theorem expressed in (6) together with (12) through (18)
above.
A.

General bianisotropic media

The optimization problem of interest is given by
maximize
subject to

Pa
Ps ≥ 0,

(19)

4
where the optimization is with respect to the interior
fields F of the structure, and where the scattered power
Ps = −Pa +Pt +Pi is used as the non-negative constraint.
In this case, the constraint is organized as −Pa +Pt +2Pi −
Pi ≥ 0 where Pa is the positive definite quadratic form
expressed in (12), Pt +2Pi is the linear form given by (13)
and Pi is given by (14). This is a convex maximization
problem having a unique solution at the boundary of the
feasible region (active constraint), cf.,25 .
By using the method of Lagrange multipliers2 and variational calculus, it can be shown that the optimal bound
on absorbed power Paopt is given by

see the detailed derivation of the result (A5) in Appendix A 1. The parameter α is found by inserting the
stationary solution (A3) into the active constraint in (19),
yielding the quadratic equation
α2 + 2α = q,

where

(22)

The denominator in (22) is convex in Ma for Im{Ma } >
0, and thus by its minimization, it can be shown that
(22) is maximal for Ma = Mb implying that q ≤ 1, see
the proof in Appendix A 2. The maximizing root of (21)
is hence given by
p
α = −1 − 1 − q.
(23)
The expression (20) together with (16) through (18),
(22) and (23) generalizes the previous result in30 which
has been given for a lossless exterior medium. In particular, by considering a lossless exterior medium with
e.g., µb = b = 1, it is seen that q = 0 (which implies that 0 ≤ q ≤ 1), α = −2, λ = 2, Mt = χ and
Im{Ma } = Im{χ}, so that (20) reproduces the corresponding result in30 (Eq. (23b) on p. 3342). Optimization of the scattered power can be treated similarly.

B.

Piecewise homogeneous and isotropic dielectric
structures

Important special cases are with the optimal absorption of piecewise homogeneous and isotropic dielectric
structures in a lossy surrounding dielectric medium. In
this case, the problem only involves the electric losses
and we can simplify the notation by writing F = E,
Fi = Ei and χi = χee,i = (i − b )I, where i = 1, . . . , N
is related to the corresponding homogeneous component

of the composed scatterer. Note that for N = 1, the
problem simplifies to the homogeneous structure. The
associated material dyadics are given by
Ma,i = i I,

Mb = b I,

Mt,i = (i − ∗b )I,

(24)

and the expression (20) becomes
Pavar =

number of the background medium. By expanding the
plane wave in regular spherical vector waves as expressed
in (B1), it can readily be shown that

with Wτ l (kb , a) defined in (B14), and where we have employed the orthogonality relationships (B13) and (B14),
as well as (B21) and (B22). It is observed that for electrically small objects of size k0 a < 1, the influence of the
background medium can be appropriately neglected, and
thus the incident field can be assumed to have a constant
amplitude Ei (r) = E0 . Hence, the relationship (27) simplifies as

where Va = i Vi = 4πa3 /3 is the volume of the layered

for the case with a lossless surrounding medium, where

The variational upper bound on the absorption cross

for i = 1, the last term in (32) vanishes because of
Wτ l (kb , a0 ) = 0 for a0 = 0, see (33) and (34), respectively.
In the case of a homogeneous (N = 1) sphere in a
lossless medium where Im{b } = 0, we have q = 0, α =

B.

Optical theorem and physical bounds for a
spherical region in a lossy medium

We consider the physical bounds on absorption that
can be derived from the optical theorem when it is formulated in terms of the multipole coefficients of a scattering
problem. In particular, the scatterer is here embedded
in a spherical region surrounded by a lossy medium, as
shown in Fig. 1. Hence, the scatterer may consist of a
general bianisotropic linear material and is bounded by
a spherical surface of radius a. The surrounding medium
is an infinite homogeneous and isotropic dielectric free
space having relative permittivity b and wave number
√
kb = k0 b . For simplicity, it is assumed that the background is non-magnetic (a magnetic background with relative permeability µb 6= 1 can straightforwardly be added
to the analysis if required). The background is furthermore assumed to be passive, and possibly lossy, so that
Im{b } ≥ 0, and with permittivity b that does not reside
at the negative part of the real axis, which corresponds
to the branch cut of the square root.
The optical theorem is once again given by the power
balance (6) with the absorbed, scattered, extinct (total)
and the incident powers defined by (7) through (10), respectively. Let aiτ ml and fτ ml denote the multipole coefficients of the incident (regular) and the scattered (outgoing) spherical vector waves, respectively, as defined in
(B1). Based on the orthogonality of the spherical vector
waves on the spherical surface ∂Va as given by (B17) and
(B18), it can be shown that

that Aτ l > 0 and Cτ l ≥ 0. Note that Bτ l is a complexvalued constant. For a lossless medium with Im{kb } = 0,

e.g.,22 (Eq. (7.18)), see also38 (Eqs. (9) through (12)).

It is emphasized that the infinite dimensional matrix
equation in (44) in general is related to an unbounded operator where the series in (45) does not converge (the corresponding matrix norm does not exist). However, this is
merely a mathematical subtlety that does not pose any
real problem here. Hence, considering that the T-matrix
in (43) can be truncated to a finite size L with l, l0 ≤ L,
the bound in (48) can be interpreted as the optimal absorption with respect to all incident and scattered fields
up to multipole order L, as L → ∞. Note in particular
that the individual terms appearing in (48) do not depend
on the truncation order, and it is only the interpretation
of the partial sums that depend on L.
For an incident plane wave where Ei (r) = E0 eikb k̂·r ,
the multipole coefficients aiτ ml are given by (B21), and
the optimal bound becomes

In the next section we will show that (50) converges
whenever there are losses in the exterior medium and
Im{kb } > 0. In Fig. 2 is illustrated the convergence of
the expression (50) by plotting the partial sums against
the number of included multipoles L. The calculations
are for electrical sizes k0 a ∈ {0.1, 1, 10} and with background losses 00b ∈ {10−9 , 10−3 , 10−1 } where b = 1 + i00b .
Clearly, with increasing external losses there are fewer
modes that can contribute to the absorption inside the
sphere, which is due to the interaction of the reactive
near-fields of the higher order modes with the lossy exterior domain.
In the lossless case, when Im{kb } = 0, the truncated
partial sums of (50) can be calculated as

NUMERICAL EXAMPLES

In this section, we illustrate the theory that has been
developed in Sections III and IV in comparison with the
normalized absorption cross sections of spherical objects
embedded in a lossy medium. As objects of study, homogeneous and layered (core-shell) spheres are selected.
The dielectric background medium is characterized by
permittivity b = 0b + i00b , where the choice of 00b is
based on the skin depth of human skin α = 2k0 00b ,
α−1 ∈ (10−4 , 10−2 ) cm, see11 (Table 3.2 on p. 49). Note
that the real part of the background permittivity does
not play the key role in comparisons presented below,
and thus we consistently choose 0b = 1 despite that the
refractive index of human tissue n ≈ 1.3311 (Table 3.8
on p. 63). In addition to this investigation, the absorption of spherical objects embedded in an almost lossless
medium with relative permittivity b = 1 + i10−9 is also
considered.
In Fig. 3 is shown a comparison of the optimal norgiven by (50), the
malized absorption cross section Qopt
a
absorption of a homogeneous sphere made of gold QAu
a
(full Mie solution) obtained by normalization of (42) with
the intensity Ii of the plane wave at the origin (29) and
the geometrical area cross section πa2 , and the corresponding variational bound Qvar
for a homogeneous oba
ject given by (31). The background relative permittivity
is b = 1 + i00b with various levels of background loss:
00b ∈ {10−9 , 10−3 , 10−1 }. The calculations of QAu
and
a
Qvar
are for two different radii of gold spheres (20 nm
a
and 89 nm) and the same photon energy range 1–5 eV
(corresponds to the wavelength range 248–1240 nm) according to the Brendel-Bormann (BB) model fitted to experimental data as in44 (the dielectric model in Eq. (11)
with parameter values from Table 1 and Table 3). The
sphere of radius a = 89 nm has been tuned to optimal
electric-dipole absorption for a lossless background as
in38 (Fig. 4). It is noted that the variational bound Qvar
a
depends very weakly on the background loss for these parameter ranges, and the bound is therefore plotted only
for 00b = 10−9 (the plots for 00b ∈ {10−3 , 10−1 } almost coincide). As can be seen in this plot, the two bounds Qopt
a

8
and Qvar
a , which are derived under different assumptions
(arbitrary structure of linear bianisotropic materials inside the sphere vs arbitrary structure of gold inside the
sphere), give complementary information about the upper bounds on absorption. At the same time, the normalized absorption cross section QAu
a is not tight with respect to the optimal bounds as shown in Fig. 3, despite it
is known that its electric-dipole contribution approaches
the bound for electric-dipole absorption when the radius
of object is 89 nm, see38 (Fig. 4).

Now, we would like to find such spherical objects which
are resonant at small electrical size, but at the same time
are of a reasonable physical size and have a resonance absorption peak close to the optimal absorption bound. To
fit these requirements, one way is to “tune” a homogeneous sphere to the resonance at the desirable electrical
size. An alternative approach is to consider a layered
sphere constructed of a dielectric core and coated with a
metallic shell.
In Fig. 4a is shown a comparison of the various upper bounds on absorption and the absorption of a sphere
tuned to optimal electric (plasmonic) dipole resonance.

with such small background losses the optimal Qopt

larly as in the previous examples, but here, the scattering
coefficients fτ ml (43) are expressed in terms of the transi(i)
tion matrices tτ l for layered spherical objects, see (B20)
in Appendix B 5. The designs have been considered for
three different ratios between the radius of core r and the
thickness of shell d: r/d ∈ {2, 3, 5}. Note that r and the
total radius a coincide with a1 and a2 (N = 2), respectively, introduced in Appendix B 5. The dielectric properties of silicon are represented by Drude-Lorentz model
that fits the measurement data and valid in the photon
range 1 −6 eV, see47 (the dielectric model in Eq. (4) with
parameter values in Table 1). The permittivity of background is b = 1 + i10−1 . As can be seen from Fig. 5,
by replacing a part of the metallic sphere with silicon,
it is possible to obtain a plasmonic resonance at smaller
electrical sizes k0 a. This is a magnetic dipole resonance,
which is inherent in dielectric materials21 . It should be
noted that by increasing the ratio between the radius of
the silicon core and the thickness of the gold shell, the
composed sphere becomes resonant at smaller electrical
sizes: e.g., for r/d = 5, the layered sphere is resonant
at k0 a ≈ 0.49, while the sphere with r/d = 2 and the
gold sphere are resonant at k0 a ≈ 0.64 and k0 a ≈ 1.13,
respectively. Hence, by increasing the ratio between the
dielectric and metallic sizes, the resonance of the composed object will move towards the resonance of the dielectric sphere that occurs when the wavelength inside
the sphere approximately equals to its diameter21,31 .
In Figs. 6a-c is shown a comparison of the various upper bounds on absorption, and the absorption
of a 2-layered core-shell sphere of different designs for
three different levels of losses in the background: 00b ∈
{10−1 , 10−3 , 10−9 }, where b = 1 + i00b . The considered
designs are with cores of radii r ∈ {30, 60, 70} nm and the
corresponding thicknesses of shells d ∈ {10, 20, 10} nm.
The core is made of germanium (Ge), which is charac-

to none of the multipole upper bounds, even when the
amount of the background losses is high, see Fig. 6a
with results for 00b = 10−1 . By comparison of the results on the upper bounds for absorption Qopt
obtained

by (50) and Qvar
for
different
amounts
of
losses
in the

background in Figs. 6a-c, it should be noted that these
bounds provide a complementary information on absorption, and thus this conclusion is valid both for homogeneous and layered spherical objects. It can be concluded
that for backgrounds with strong losses, the multipole
bound Qopt
brings more information on absorption limia
tations, while the variational bound Qvar
a is more tight for
smaller objects that are embedded in low loss surrounding media, which complements the results obtained by

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, two fundamental multipole bounds on
absorption of scattering objects embedded in a lossy surrounding medium have been derived. The derivation of
these bounds have been made under two fundamentally
different assumptions: based on equivalent currents inside the scatterer, and with respect to the external fields
using the T-matrix parameters, respectively. The first
bound depends on the material properties of scatterer
as well as on its shape, while the second bound is applicable to spherical objects made of an arbitrary material. Through the numerical examples, it has been illustrated that the derived bounds can complement each
other, depending on the amount of losses in the surrounding medium.

Orthogonality over a spherical volume

isotropic materials. Let ai , i , µi , ki = k0 µi i and
p
ηi = µi /i (for i = 1, . . . , N ) denote the radii, the relative permittivities, the relative permeabilities, the wave
numbers, and the relative wave impedances of each of N
layers of the sphere, respectively. The scatterer of the
total radius a = aN is embedded in the medium char√
acterized by the wave number kb = k0 µb b and the

Note that kN +1 = kb , ηN +1 = ηb , and tτ l = 0 due to
the non-singular behavior of the electric field at the origin, i.e., r = 0. Hereby, the expression for the transition matrix (B20) reduces to the result for an homogeneous isotropic sphere, see6 (Eqs. (4.52) on p. 100) and22
