Abstract
We perform a rigorous piecewise-flat discretization of classical general relativity in
the first-order formulation, in both 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions, carefully keeping track
of curvature and torsion via holonomies. We show that the resulting phase space is
precisely that of spin networks, the quantum states of discrete spacetime in loop quantum gravity, with additional degrees of freedom called edge modes, which control the
gluing between cells. This work establishes, for the first time, a rigorous proof of the
equivalence between spin networks and piecewise-flat geometries with curvature and
torsion degrees of freedom. In addition, it demonstrates that careful consideration of
edge modes is crucial both for the purpose of this proof and for future work in the field
of loop quantum gravity. It also shows that spin networks have a dual description related to teleparallel gravity, where gravity is encoded in torsion instead of curvature
degrees of freedom. Finally, it sets the stage for collaboration between the loop quantum gravity community and theoretical physicists working on edge modes from other
perspectives, such as quantum electrodynamics, non-abelian gauge theories, and classical gravity.

Acknowledgments
Note: Wherever a list of names is provided in this section, it is always ordered alphabetically by last name.
First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor, Laurent Freidel, for giving
me the opportunity to study at the wonderful Perimeter Institute and to write both
my master’s thesis and my PhD thesis under his guidance, and for supporting me and
believing in me throughout the last 5 years, even when I didn’t believe in myself. His
deep physical intuition has inspired me countless times. He constantly challenged me
and pushed me to expand my horizons in both mathematics and physics, to improve
my research skills as well as my presentation and communication skills, and to be a
better scientist. Needless to say, this thesis would not have existed without him.
I am also incredibly thankful to Florian Girelli for collaborating with me on this research and for his continued assistance and helpful advice during the last 3 years. Our
frequent meetings and stimulating discussions have been an invaluable resource, and
provided me not only with the knowledge and insight necessary to succeed in writing
this thesis, but also with the motivation to overcome the many obstacles that are an
inevitable part of research.
I thank my examination committee members Robert Mann, John Moffat, and Robert
Myers, as well as the external examiner Karim Noui, for taking time out of their very
busy schedules to read this thesis. I hope I have made it readable and interesting
enough for this to be a pleasant experience.
Special thanks go to Wolfgang Wieland, who patiently provided clear and detailed explanations of complicated concepts in mathematics and physics whenever I needed his
help, and to Marc Geiller, Hal Haggard, Seyed Faroogh Moosavian, Yasha Neiman,
Kasia Rejzner, Aldo Riello, and Vasudev Shyam for very helpful discussions.
I thank my students from the International Summer School for Young Physicists (ISSYP), the Perimeter Institute Undergraduate Summer Program, and the Perimeter
Scholars International (PSI) Program over the last 5 years for consistently asking challenging questions, which forced me to think outside the box and improve myself and
my knowledge in many different ways.
Sharing my knowledge of mathematics and physics in the numerous teaching and outreach events, programs, and initiatives at Perimeter Institute has served as a constant
reminder of why I got into science in the first place. For that privilege, I owe my gratitude to Greg Dick, Kelly Foyle, Damian Pope, Angela Robinson, Marie Strickland,
and Tonia Williams from Perimeter Institute’s outreach department.
I owe great thanks to Dan Wohns and Gang Xu for teaching me during my studies in
the PSI program, for choosing me to serve as a teaching assistant in the PSI quantum
field theory and string theory courses, for introducing me to many fun board games,
and for inviting me to conduct the Perimeter Institute Orchestra. I also thank the
members of the orchestra for agreeing to play my composition, Music at the Planck
Scale, which was no easy task by any means. Working on this and other music projects
has made my time at Perimeter Institute so much more fun!

I am grateful to Perimeter Institute’s Academic Programs Manager, Debbie Guenther, for being so amazingly helpful and supportive in many different logistical hurdles throughout both my master’s and PhD studies. I also thank the staff at Perimeter
Institute’s Black Hole Bistro, and in particular Dan Lynch and Olivia Taylor, for providing me with delicious food on a daily basis for 5 years, and for tolerating my many
unusual requests.
I would not have been where I am today without my parents, Avner and Judith
Shoshany, who, ever since I was born, have constantly empowered me to follow my
dreams, no matter how crazy, impossible, or impractical they were, and always did
everything they could in order to help me achieve those dreams and more. They have
my eternal gratitude and appreciation.
Finally, I would like to thank all of my friends, and especially Jacob Barnett, Juan
Cayuso, Daniel Guariento, Fiona McCarthy, Yasha Neiman, Kasia Rejzner, Vasudev
Shyam, Matthew VonHippel, Dan Wohns, and Gang Xu, for much-needed distractions from the frequent frustrations of graduate school over the last 5 years (especially
in the form of playing games1 or watching stand-up comedy), for providing unconditional emotional support when needed, and/or for patiently listening to my endless
complaints.

1 In this context I would also like to thank Daniel Gottesman for creating and running his exceptional

Dungeons and Dragons campaign!

Introduction

1.1

Loop Quantum Gravity

When perturbatively quantizing gravity, one obtains a low-energy effective theory,
which breaks down at high energies. There are several different approaches to solving
this problem and obtaining a theory of quantum gravity. String theory, for example,
attempts to do so by postulating entirely new degrees of freedom, which can then be
shown to reduce to general relativity (or some modification thereof) at the low-energy
limit. Loop quantum gravity [5] instead tries to quantize gravity non-perturbatively, by
quantizing holonomies (or Wilson loops) instead of the metric, in an attempt to avoid the
issues arising from perturbative quantization.
The starting point of the canonical version of loop quantum gravity [6] is the reformulation of general relativity as a non-abelian Yang-Mills gauge theory on a spatial slice
of spacetime, with the gauge group SU (2) related to spatial rotations, the Yang-Mills
connection A related to the usual connection and extrinsic curvature, and the “electric
field” E related to the metric (or more precisely, the frame field). Once gravity is reformulated in this way, one can utilize the existing arsenal of techniques from Yang-Mills
theory, and in particular lattice gauge theory, to tackle the problem of quantum gravity
[7].
This theory is quantized by considering graphs, that is, sets of nodes connected by links.
One defines holonomies, or path-ordered exponentials of the connection, along each link.
The curvature on the spatial slice can then be probed by looking at holonomies along
loops on the graph. Without going into the technical details, the general idea is that if
we know the curvature inside every possible loop, then this is equivalent to knowing
the curvature at every point.
The kinematical Hilbert space of loop quantum gravity is obtained from the set of all
wave-functionals for all possible graphs, together with an appropriate SU (2)-invariant
and diffeomorphism-invariant inner product. The physical Hilbert space is a subset of
the kinematical one, containing only the states invariant under all gauge transformations – or in other words, annihilated by all of the constraints. Since gravity is a totally
constrained system – in the Hamiltonian formulation, the action is just a sum of constraints – a quantum state annihilated by all of the constraints is analogous to a metric
which solves Einstein’s equations in the classical Lagrangian formulation.
Specifically, to get from the kinematical to the physical Hilbert space, three steps must
be taken:
1. First, we apply the Gauss constraint to the kinematical Hilbert space. Since
the Gauss constraint generates SU (2) gauge transformation, we obtain a space
of SU (2)-invariant states, called spin network states [8], which are the graphs
mentioned above, but with
o colored by irreducible representations of
n their links
SU (2), that is, spins j ∈

.

2. Then, we apply the spatial diffeomorphism constraint. We obtain a space of
equivalence classes of spin networks under spatial diffeomorphisms, a.k.a. knots.
These states are now abstract graphs, not localized in space. This is analogous
to how a classical geometry is an equivalence class of metrics under diffeomorphisms.
3. Lastly, we apply the Hamiltonian constraint. This step is still not entirely wellunderstood, and is one of the main open problems of the theory.
One of loop quantum gravity’s most celebrated results is the existence of area and
volume operators. They are derived by taking the usual integrals of area and volume
forms and promoting the “electric field” E, which is conjugate to the connection A,
to a functional derivative δ/δA. The spin network states turn out to be eigenstates of
these operators, and they have discrete spectra which depend on the spins of the links.
This means that loop quantum gravity contains a quantum geometry, which is a feature
one would expect a quantum theory of spacetime to have. It also hints that spacetime
is discrete at the Planck scale.
However, it is not clear how to rigorously define the classical geometry related to a
particular spin network state. In this thesis, we will try to answer that question.

1.2

Teleparallel Gravity

The theory of general relativity famously describes gravity as a result of the curvature
of spacetime itself. Furthermore, the geometry of spacetime is assumed to be torsionless by employing the Levi-Civita connection, which is torsionless by definition. While
this is the most popular formulation, there exists an alternative but mathematically
equivalent formulation called teleparallel gravity [9, 10, 11], differing from general relativity only by a boundary term. In this formulation, one instead uses the Weitzenböck
connection, which is flat by definition. The gravitational degrees of freedom are then
encoded in the torsion of the spacetime geometry.
In the canonical version of loop quantum gravity, as we mentioned above, one starts
by rewriting general relativity in the Hamiltonian formulation using the Ashtekar
variables. One finds a fully constrained system, that is, the Hamiltonian is simply
a sum of constraints. In 2+1 spacetime dimensions, where gravity is topological [12],
there are two such constraints:
• The Gauss (or torsion) constraint, which imposes zero torsion everywhere,
• The curvature (or flatness) constraint, which imposes zero curvature everywhere.
After imposing both constraints, we will obtain the physical Hilbert space of the theory. It does not matter which constraint is imposed first, since the resulting physical
Hilbert space will be the same. However, on a more conceptual level, the first constraint that we impose is used to define the kinematics of the theory, while the second constraint will encode the dynamics. Thus, it seems natural to identify general
2

relativity with the quantization in which the Gauss constraint is imposed first, and
teleparallel gravity with that in which the curvature constraint is imposed first.
Indeed, in loop quantum gravity, which is a quantization of general relativity, the
Gauss constraint is imposed first, as detailed in the previous section. This is true in
both 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions. In 2+1D, the curvature constraint is imposed at the
dynamical level in order to obtain the Hilbert space of physical states. In 3+1D there
is no curvature constraint – the curvature is, in general, not flat. One instead imposes
the diffeomorphism and Hamiltonian constraints to get the physical Hilbert space, but
the Gauss constraint is still imposed first.
In [13], an alternative choice was suggested where the order of constraints, in 2+1D,
is reversed. The curvature constraint is imposed first by employing the group network
basis of translation-invariant states, and the Gauss constraint is the one which encodes
the dynamics. This dual loop quantum gravity quantization is the quantum counterpart
of teleparallel gravity, and could be used to study the dual vacua proposed in [14, 15].
In this thesis, we will only deal with the classical theory. We will show how, by discretizing the phase space of continuous gravity in the first-order formulation (and
with the Ashtekar variables in 3+1D), one obtains a spectrum of discrete phase spaces,
one of which is the classical version of spin networks [16] and the other is a dual formulation (“dual loop gravity”), which may be interpreted as the classical version of
the group network basis, and is intuitively related to teleparallel gravity. The latter
case was first studied in [17], but only in 2+1 dimensions, and only in the simple case
where there are no curvature or torsion excitations.
Another phase space of interest in the spectrum discussed above is a mixed phase
space, containing both loop gravity and its dual. In 2+1D it is intuitively related to
Chern-Simons theory [18], as we will motivate below. In this case our formalism is
related to existing results [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25].

1.3

Quantization, Discretization, Subdivision, and Truncation

One of the key challenges in trying to define a theory of quantum gravity at the quantum level is to find a regularization that does not drastically break the fundamental
symmetries of the theory. This is a challenge in any gauge theory, but gravity is especially challenging, for two reasons. First, one expects that the quantum theory possesses a fundamental length scale; and second, the gauge group contains diffeomorphism symmetry, which affects the nature of the space on which the regularization is
applied.
In gauge theories such as quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the only known way to
satisfy these requirements, other than gauge-fixing before regularization, is to put the
theory on a lattice, where an effective finite-dimensional gauge symmetry survives at
each scale. One would like to devise such a scheme in the gravitational context as well.
In this thesis, we develop a step-by-step procedure to achieve this, exploiting, among
other things, the fact that first-order gravity in 2+1 dimensions, as well as gravity in
3

3+1 dimensions with the Ashtekar variables, closely resembles other gauge theories.
We find not only the spin network or holonomy-flux phase space, which is what we
initially expected, but also additional particle-like or string-like degrees of freedom
coupled to the curvature and torsion.
As explained above, in canonical loop quantum gravity (LQG), one can show that
the geometric operators possess a discrete spectrum. This is, however, only possible
after one chooses the quantum spin network states to have support on a graph. Spin
network states can be understood as describing a quantum version of discretized spatial
geometry [5], and the Hilbert space associated to a graph can be related, in the classical
limit, to a set of discrete piecewise-flat geometries [26, 16].
This means that the LQG quantization scheme consists at the same time of a quantization and a discretization; moreover, the quantization of the geometric spectrum is
entangled with the discretization of the fundamental variables. It has been argued
that it is essential to disentangle these two different features [27], especially when one
wants to address dynamical issues.
In [27, 28], it was suggested that one should understand the discretization as a twostep process: a subdivision followed by a truncation. In the first step one subdivides
the systems into fundamental cells, and in the second step one chooses a truncation of
degrees of freedom in each cell, which is consistent with the symmetries of the theory.
By focusing first on the classical discretization, before any quantization takes place,
several aspects of the theory can be clarified. Let us mention some examples:
• This discretization scheme allows us to study more concretely how to recover
the continuum geometry out of the classical discrete geometry associated to the
spin networks [27, 28]. In particular, since the discretization is now understood
as a truncation of the continuous degrees of freedom, it is possible to associate a
continuum geometry to the discrete data.
• It provides a justification for the fact that, in the continuum case, the momentum
variables are equipped with a vanishing Poisson bracket, whereas in the discrete case, the momentum variables do not commute with each other [27, 17, 14].
These variables need to be dressed by the gauge connection, as we will explain in
the next section, and are now understood as charge generators [29].
• As detailed above, our discretization scheme permits the discovery and study of
a dual formulation of loop gravity, both in 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions.
The separation of discretization into two distinct steps in our formalism work as follows. First we perform a subdivision, or decomposition into subsystems. More precisely, we define a cellular decomposition on our 2D or 3D spatial manifold, where the
cells can be any (convex) polygons or polyhedra respectively. This structure has a
dual structure, which as we will see, is the spin network graph, with each cell dual
to a node, and each element on the boundary of the cell (edge in 2+1D, side in 3+1D)
dual to a link connected to that node.
4

Then, we perform a truncation, or coarse-graining of the subsystems. In this step, we
assume that there is arbitrary curvature and torsion inside each loop of the spin network. We then “compress” the information about the geometry into singular codimension2 excitations. In 2+1D it will be stored in a 0-dimensional (point particle) excitation,
while in 3+1D it will be stored in a 1-dimensional (string) excitation. Crucially, since
the only way to probe the geometry is by looking at the holonomies on the loops of
the spin network, the observables before and after this truncation are the same.
Another way to interpret this step is to instead assume that spacetime is flat everywhere, with matter sources being distributive, i.e., given by Dirac delta functions,
which then generate singular curvature and torsion by virtue of the Einstein equation.
We interpret these distributive matter sources as point particles in 2+1D or strings
in 3+1D, and this is entirely equivalent to truncating a continuous geometry, since
holonomies cannot distinguish between continuous and distributive geometries.
Once we performed subdivision and truncation, we can now define discrete variables
on each cell and integrate the continuous symplectic potential in order to obtain a
discrete potential, which represents the discrete phase space. In this step, we will see
that the mathematical structures we are using conspire to cancel many terms in the
potential, allowing us to fully integrate it.

1.4

Edge Modes

In the subdivision process described above, some of the bulk degrees of freedom are
replaced by edge mode degrees of freedom, which play a key role in the construction of
the full phase space and our understanding of symmetry. This happens because dealing with subsystems in a gauge theory requires special care with regards to boundaries, where gauge invariance is naively broken, and thus additional degrees of freedom must be added in order to restore it. These new degrees of freedom transform
non-trivially under new symmetry transformations located on the edges and/or corners; we will usually ignore this distinction and just call them “edge modes”. The
process of subdivision therefore requires a canonical extension of the phase space,
and converting some momenta into non-commutative charge generators.
The general philosophy is presented in [29] and exemplified in the 3+1D gravity context in [30, 31, 32]. An intuitive reason behind this fundamental mechanism is also
presented in [33] and the general idea is, in a sense, already present in [34]. In the
2+1D gravity context, the edge modes have been studied in great detail in [4, 35].
This phenomenon even happens when the boundary is taken to be infinity [36], where
these new degrees of freedom are called soft modes.
These extra degrees of freedom, which possess their own phase space structure and
appear as dressings of the gravitationally charged observables, affect the commutation
relations of the dressed observables. In a precise sense, this is what happens with the
fluxes in loop gravity: the “discretized” fluxes are dressed by the connection degrees
of freedom, implying a different Poisson structure compared to the continuum ones.
5

A nice continuum derivation of this fact is given in [37].
Once this subdivision and extension of the phase space are done properly, one has to
understand the gluing of subregions as the fusion of edge modes across the boundaries. If the boundary is trivial, this fusion merely allows us to extend gauge-invariant
observables from one region to another. However, when several boundaries meet at
a corner, there is now the possibility to have residual degrees of freedom that come
from this fusion.
We witness exactly this phenomenon at the corners of our cellular decomposition –
vertices in 2+1D or edges in 3+1D – where new degrees of freedom, in addition to
the usual loop gravity ones, are found after regluing. As we will see below, the edge
modes at the boundaries of the cells in our cellular decomposition – edges in 2+1D or
sides in 3+1D – will cancel with the edge modes on the boundaries of the adjacent cells.
However, the modes at the corners do not have anything to cancel with. These degrees
of freedom will thus survive the discretization process. In 2+1D, they introduce a
particle-like phase space [38, 39], while in 3+1D, we interpret them as cosmic strings
[40].
One might expect that the geometry will be encoded in the constraints alone, by imposing, roughly speaking, that a loop of holonomies sees the curvature inside it and a
loop of fluxes sees the torsion inside it. As we will see, while the constraints do indeed
encode the geometry, the presence of the edge and corner modes is the reason for the
inclusion of the curvature and torsion themselves as additional phase space variables.
After we have proven our results in 2+1D a very careful and rigorous way, by regularizing the singularities at the vertices, we will derive them again in a different and
shorter way. In this alternative calculation, we will show that when calculating the
symplectic potential, the terms at the corners (that is, the vertices) completely vanish if there are no curvature or torsion excitations at the vertices. However, if such
excitations do exist, the corner terms instead turn out to add up in exactly the right
way to produce the additional phase space variables we found before, in our more
complicated calculation.
In the 3+1D case, many additional complications occur that were not present in 2+1D,
and therefore we will jump right to the alternative analysis. A major difference, as
mentioned above, is that the sources of curvature and torsion will now be 1-dimensional
strings, rather than 0-dimensional point particles as we had in 2+1D. However, the
curvature and torsion will nonetheless still be detected by loops of holonomies, as in
the 2+1D case. Furthermore, we will discover that, analogously, one can isolate the
terms at the corners (which are now edges), and they vanish unless the edges possess
curvature or torsion excitations. In fact, interestingly, we will obtain the exact same
discrete phase space as in the 2+1D case: a spin network coupled to edge modes.
As we alluded in the beginning of this section, the edge modes come equipped with
new symmetries, which did not exist in the continuum theory. We will show below that multiplying the discrete holonomies by group elements from the right (right
translations) corresponds to the usual gauge transformation. The new symmetries we
6

discovered are obtained by instead multiplying from the left (left translations). These
symmetries leave the continuous connection invariant, and therefore correspond to
completely new degrees of freedom in the discrete variables, which did not exist in
the continuum. When the edge modes are “frozen”, meaning that we choose a particular value for them (which can be, without loss of generality, the identity), the new
symmetries are broken, and the phase space reduces to the usual loop gravity phase
space (or its dual), without these additional degrees of freedom.
The conceptual shift towards an edge mode interpretation provides a different paradigm
to explore some of the key questions of loop quantum gravity. For example, the notion
of the continuum limit (in a 3+1-dimensional theory) attached to subregions could potentially be revisited and clarified in light of this new interpretation, and related to the
approach developed in [41, 42]. It also strengthens, in a way, the spinor approach to
LQG [43, 44, 45], which allows one to recover the LQG formalism from spinors living
on the nodes of the graph. These spinors can be seen as a different parametrization of
the edge modes, in a similar spirit to [46, 47].
Edge modes have recently been studied for the purpose of making proper entropy
calculations in gauge theory or, more generally, defining local subsystems [34]. Their
use could provide some new guidance for understanding the concept of entropy in
loop quantum gravity. They are also relevant to the study of specific types of boundary excitations in condensed matter [48], which could generate some interesting new
directions to explore in LQG, as in [49, 41]. Very recently, [50, 51] showed that one can
view the constraints of 3+1D gravity in the Ashtekar formulation as a conservation of
edge charges, thus uncovering a new conceptual framework.

Comparison to Previous Work
Combinatorial Quantization of 2+1D Gravity

Discretization (and quantization) of 2+1D gravity was already performed some time
ago with the combinatorial quantization of Chern-Simons theory [19, 20, 21, 22]. While
our results in 2+1D should be equivalent to this formulation, they also add some new
and important insights.
First, we work directly with the gravitational variables and the associated geometric
quantities, such as torsion and curvature. Our procedure describes clearly how such
objects should be discretized, which is not obvious in the Chern-Simons picture; see
for example [52] where the link between the combinatorial framework and LQG was
explored.
Second, we are using a different discretization procedure than the one used in the combinatorial approach. Instead of considering the reduced graph, we use the full graph
to generate the spin network, and assume that the equations of motion are satisfied in
the cells dual to the spin network.
Finally, we will show in detail that our discretization scheme applies, with the necessary modifications, to the 3+1D case as well, unlike the combinatorial approach.

1.5.2

2+1D Gravity, Chern-Simons Theory, and Point Particles

In [53], it is emphasized that Chern-Simons theory and Einstein gravity are in fact not
equivalent up to a boundary term, with the difference being that in Einstein gravity
the fame field e is required to be invertible, unlike in Chern-Simons theory. We will
always assume in this thesis that the frame field is in fact invertible, and often use the
inverse frame field as part of our derivation, but this will not be a problem since we
are only interested in the gravity case anyway, and in particular in the generalization
to 3+1D gravity, where the frame field is invertible as well.
The same author, in [54], analyzed the phase space of a toy model of discretized 2+1D
gravity with point particles, which is similar to the one we will consider here. In
particular, Chapter 4 of [54] obtains results that are remarkably similar to some of
ours. The symplectic potential found in Eq. (4.48) of [54] is reminiscent3 of our Eq.
(8.13) with λ = 1, which, as we will show, is the dual (or teleparallel) loop gravity
polarization, although there it is not interpreted as such.
Another interesting treatment of point particles in 2+1D gravity was given in [55],
where the coupling to spinning particles and the relation with the spin foam scalar
product were examined, and in [56], where the relation between canonical loop quantization and spin foam quantization in 3+1D was established. Finally, in [57] it was
shown, in the context of the Ponzano-Regge model of 2+1D quantum gravity, that
particles arise as curvature defects, which is indeed what we will see in this thesis;
furthermore, it was shown this model is linked to the quantization of Chern-Simons
theory.

Outline

This thesis is meant to be as self-contained as possible, with all the necessary background for each chapter provided in full in the preceding chapters. First, in Chapter
2, we provide a comprehensive list of basic definitions, notations, and conventions
which will be used throughout the thesis. It is highly recommended that the reader
not skip this chapter, as some of our notation is slightly non-standard. Then we begin
the thesis itself, which consists of four parts.
Part I presents 2+1-dimensional general relativity in the continuum. Chapter 3 consists
of a self-contained derivation of Chern-Simons theory and, from it, 2+1-dimensional
gravity in both the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations. It also introduces the
teleparallel formulation. Chapter 4 then discusses Euclidean gauge transformations
and the role of edge modes. Finally, in Chapter 5 we introduce matter degrees of
freedom in the form of point particles.
In Part II, we discretize the theory presented in Part I. In Chapter 6, we describe the
discrete geometry we will be using. We define the cellular decomposition and the
dual spin network, including a derivation of the spin network phase space, and then
3 Note

that to get from the notation of [54] to ours, one should take zλ 7→ xc and gλ 7→ hc .

8

show how the continuous geometry is truncated using holonomies. We also introduce the continuity conditions relating the variables between different cells. Chapter
7 then discusses gauge transformations and symmetries in the discrete setting, which
includes new symmetries which did not exist in the continuous version. In Chapter 8
we rigorously discretize the symplectic potential of the continuous theory, and show
how, from the continuous gravity phase space, we obtain both the spin network and
edge mode phase spaces. Chapters 9 and 10 then analyzes, in elaborate detail, the
constraints obtained in the discrete theory and the symmetries they generate. Finally,
in Chapter 11 we repeat the derivation of Chapter 8 from scratch under much simplifying assumptions.
Part III is the prelude for adapting our results from the toy model of 2+1 dimensions
to the physically relevant case of 3+1 spacetime dimensions. In Chapter 12 we provide a detailed and self-contained derivation of the Ashtekar variables and the loop
gravity Hamiltonian action, including the constraints. Special care is taken to write
everything in terms of index-free Lie-algebra-valued differential forms, as we did in
the 2+1-dimensional case, which – in addition to being more elegant – will greatly
simplify our derivation. Chapter 13 then introduces matter degrees of freedom, this
time in the form of cosmic strings, mirroring our discussion of point particles in the
2+1-dimensional case.
Finally, in Part IV we discretize the 3+1-dimensional theory. In Chapter 14 we introduce the discrete geometry, where now the cells are 3-dimensional, and discuss the
truncation of the geometry using holonomies. In Chapter 15 we perform a calculation analogous to the one we performed in Chapters 8 and later in 11, although it is
of course now more involved. We show that, in the 3+1-dimensional case as well,
the spin network phase space coupled to edge modes is obtained from the continuous phase space. Moreover, we obtain a spectrum of polarizations which includes a
dual theory, as in the 2+1-dimensional case. Chapter 16 summarizes the results of this
thesis and presents several avenues for potential future research.

Throughout this thesis, we will use the following conventions for indices4 :
• In the 2+1D case:
– µ, ν, . . . ∈ {0, 1, 2} represent 2+1D spacetime components.
– i, j, . . . ∈ (0, 1, 2) represent 2+1D internal / Lie algebra components.
4 The

usage of lowercase Latin letters for both spatial and internal spatial indices is somewhat confusing, but seems to be standard in the literature, so we will use it here as well.

We consider a 2+1D or 3+1D manifold M with topology Σ × R where Σ is a 2 or 3dimensional spatial manifold and R represents time. Our metric signature convention
is (−, +, +) or (−, +, +, +). In index-free notation, we denote a Lie-algebra-valued differential form of degree p (or p-form) on Σ, with one algebra index i and p spatial indices
a1 , . . . , a p , as
1
(2.3)
A ≡ Aia1 ···a p τ i dx a1 ∧ · · · ∧ dx a p ∈ Ω p (Σ, g) ,
p!
where Aia1 ···a p are the components and τ i are the generators of the algebra g in which
the form is valued.
Sometimes we will only care about the algebra index, and write A ≡ Ai τ i with the
1 i
spatial indices implied, such that Ai ≡ p!
A a1 ···a p dx a1 ∧ · · · ∧ dx a p are real-valued pforms. Other times we will only care about the spacetime indices, and write A ≡
1
ap
a1
i
p! A a1 ··· a p dx ∧ · · · ∧ dx with the algebra index implied, such that A a1 ··· a p ≡ A a1 ··· a p τ i
are algebra-valued 0-forms.

2.3

The Graded Commutator

Given any two Lie-algebra-valued forms A and B of degrees deg A and deg B respectively, we define the graded commutator:

which satisfies

[A, B] ≡ A ∧ B − (−1)deg A deg B B ∧ A,

(2.4)

[A, B] = − (−1)deg A deg B [B, A] .

(2.5)

If at least one of the forms has even degree, this reduces to the usual anti-symmetric
commutator; if we then interpret A and B as vectors in R3 , then this is none other than
11

the vector cross product A × B. Note that [A, B] is a Lie-algebra-valued (deg A + deg B)form.
The graded commutator satisfies the graded Leibniz rule:
d [A, B] = [dA, B] + (−1)deg A [A, dB] .

(2.6)

In terms of indices, with deg A = p and deg B = q, we have

[A, B] =

1
[A, B]ka1 ···a p b1 ···bq τ k dx a1 ∧ · · · ∧ dx a p ∧ dx b1 ∧ · · · ∧ dx bq ,
( p + q)!

(2.7)

where

( p + q)! k i
j
e ij A[a1 ···a p Bb ···b ] .
q
1
p!q!
In terms of spatial indices alone, we have
[A, B]ka1 ···a p b1 ···bq ≡

[A, B] a1 ···a p b1 ···bq ≡

( p + q)! k i
j
e ij A[a1 ···a p Bb ···b ] τ k ,
q
1
p!q!

(2.8)

(2.9)

and in terms of Lie algebra indices alone, we simply have

[A, B]k = ek ij Ai B j .

2.4

(2.10)

The Graded Dot Product and the Triple Product

We define a dot (inner) product, also known as the Killing form, on the generators of the
Lie group as follows:
Ji · P j = δij ,

Ji · J j = Pi · P j = 0,

(2.11)

where δij is the Kronecker delta. Given two Lie-algebra-valued forms A and B of
degrees deg A and deg B respectively, such that A ≡ Ai Ji is a pure rotation and B ≡
Bi Pi is a pure translation, we define the graded dot product5 :
A · B ≡ δij Ai ∧ B j ,

(2.13)

where ∧ is the usual wedge product6 of differential forms. The dot product satisfies
A · B = (−1)deg A deg B B · A.

(2.14)

5 In

the general case, which will only be relevant for our discussion of Chern-Simons theory, for
g ⊕ g∗ -valued forms A ≡ AiJ Ji + AiP Pi and B ≡ B iJ Ji + B Pi Pi we have


j
j
A · B = δij AiJ ∧ B P + AiP ∧ B J .
(2.12)
6 Given

any two differential forms A and B, the wedge product A ∧ B is the (deg A + deg B)-form
satisfying A ∧ B = (−1)deg A deg B B ∧ A and d ( A ∧ B) = dA ∧ B + (−1)deg A A ∧ dB.

12

Again, if at least one of the forms has even degree, this reduces to the usual symmetric
dot product. Note that A · B is a real-valued (deg A + deg B)-form.
The graded dot product satisfies the graded Leibniz rule:
d (A · B) = dA · B + (−1)deg A A · dB.

(2.15)

In terms of indices, with deg A = p and deg B = q, we have
A·B =

1
(A · B) a1 ···a p b1 ···bq dx a1 ∧ · · · ∧ dx a p ∧ dx b1 ∧ · · · ∧ dx bq ,
( p + q)!

where

(A · B) a1 ···a p b1 ···bq =

( p + q)!
j
δij Ai[a1 ···a p Bb ···b ] .
q
1
p!q!

Since the graded dot product is a trace, and thus cyclic, it satisfies

 

g−1 Ag · g−1 Bg = A · B,

(2.16)

(2.17)

(2.18)

where g is any group element. We will use this identity many times throughout the
thesis to simplify expressions.
Finally, by combining the dot product and the commutator, we obtain the triple product:

[A, B] · C = A · [B, C] = eijk Ai ∧ B j ∧ C k .

(2.19)

Note that this is a real-valued (deg A + deg B + deg C)-form. The triple product inherits the symmetry and anti-symmetry properties of the dot product and the commutator.

2.5

Variational Anti-Derivations on Field Space

In addition to the familiar exterior derivative (or differential) d and interior product ι on
spacetime, we introduce a variational exterior derivative (or variational differential) δ and
a variational interior product I on field space. These operators act analogously to d and
ι, and in particular they are nilpotent, e.g. δ2 = 0, and satisfy the graded Leibniz rule
as defined above.
Degrees of differential forms are counted with respect to spacetime and field space
separately; for example, if f is a 0-form then dδ f is a 1-form on spacetime, due to d,
and independently also a 1-form on field space, due to δ. The dot product defined
above also includes an implicit wedge product with respect to field-space forms, such
that e.g. δA · δB = −δB · δA if A and B are 0-forms on field space. In this thesis, the
only place where one should watch out for the wedge product and graded Leibniz
rule on field space is when we will discuss the symplectic form, which is a field-space
2-form; everywhere else, we will only deal with field-space 0-forms and 1-forms.
13

We also define a convenient shorthand notation for the Maurer-Cartan 1-form on field
space:
∆g ≡ δgg−1 ,
(2.20)
where g is a G-valued 0-form, which satisfies

Therefore, in our notation, adjacent holonomy subscripts must always be identical;
a term such as H ab Hcd is illegal, since one can only compose two holonomies if the

For the Maurer-Cartan 1-form on field space, we move the end point of the holonomy
to a superscript:
∆Hba ≡ δH ab Hba .
(2.26)
On the right-hand side, the subscripts b are adjacent, so the two holonomies δH ab and
Hba may be composed. However, one can only compose ∆Hba with a holonomy that
starts at a, and b is raised to a superscript to reflect that. For example, ∆Hba Hbc is illegal, since this is actually δH ab Hba Hbc and the holonomies Hba and Hbc cannot be composed. However, ∆Hba H ac is perfectly legal, and results in δH ab Hba H ac = δH ab Hbc .
Note that from (2.21) and (2.22) we have
∆Hba = −Hba ∆Hba H ab ,
∆Hca = ∆ (H ab Hbc ) = ∆Hba + H ab ∆Hbc Hba = H ab (∆Hbc − ∆Hba ) Hba ,
both of which are compatible with the adjacent subscripts rule.

The Cartan Decomposition

We can split a G n g∗ -valued (Euclidean) holonomy H ab into a rotational holonomy h ab ,
valued in G, and a translational holonomy xba , valued in g∗ . We do this using the Cartan
decomposition
b

H ab ≡ exa h ab ,

H ab ∈ Ω0 (Σ, G n g∗ ) ,

h ab ∈ Ω0 (Σ, G ) ,

xba ∈ Ω0 (Σ, g∗ ) .
(2.29)

In the following, we will employ the useful identity
−1

h ex h−1 = ehxh ,

h ∈ Ω0 (Σ, G ) ,

x ∈ Ω0 (Σ, g∗ ) ,

(2.30)

which for matrix Lie algebras (such as the ones we use here) may be proven by writing
the exponential as a power series.
Taking the inverse of H ab and using (2.30), we get

c

H ab Hbc = H ac = exa h ac ,

(2.34)

so we conclude that
h ac = h ab hbc ,

xca = xba ⊕ xcb ≡ xba + h ab xcb hba = h ab (xcb − xba ) hba ,

(2.35)

where in the second identity we denoted the composition of the two translational
holonomies with a ⊕, and used (2.33) to get the right-hand side. It is now clear why
the end point of the translational holonomy is a superscript – again, this is for compatibility with the adjacent subscript rule.

Chern-Simons Theory and 2+1D Gravity

3.1

The Geometric Variables

Consider a spacetime manifold M as defined in Section 2.2. The geometry of spacetime
is described, in the first-order formulation, by a (co-)frame field 1-form ei ≡ eiµ dx µ and a
ij

spin connection 1-form ω ij ≡ ωµ dx µ . We can take the internal-space Hodge dual7 of the
spin connection and define a connection with only one internal index, Ai ≡ 12 eijk ω jk .
We can then identify the internal indices with algebra indices, where the connection is
valued in the rotation algebra g and the frame field is valued in the translation algebra
g∗ , and write these quantities in convenient index-free notation:
A ≡ Aiµ Ji dx µ ,

e ≡ eiµ Pi dx µ .

(3.1)

We also collect them into the Chern-Simons connection 1-form A, valued in g ⊕ g∗ :

A ≡ A + e ≡ Ai Ji + ei Pi ,

(3.2)

where A ≡ Ai Ji is the g-valued connection 1-form and e ≡ ei Pi is the g∗ -valued frame
field 1-form. Defining the covariant exterior derivatives with respect to A and A,
dA ≡ d + [A, ·] ,

dA ≡ d + [A, ·] ,

(3.3)

we define the g ⊕ g∗ -valued curvature 2-form F as8 :

F ≡ dA A = d A +

[A, A] ,
2

(3.4)

which may be split into

F ≡ F + T ≡ F i Ji + T i Pi ,
Fi J

where F ≡
i is the g-valued curvature 2-form and T ≡
2-form, and they are defined in terms of A and e as
F ≡ dA A = dA +

(3.6)

Footnote 18 for the definition of the Hodge dual on spacetime. Here the definition is the same,
except that the star operator acts on the internal indices instead of the spacetime indices. The trick we
used here works because ω ij is a 2-form on the internal space (since it is anti-symmetric), and the Hodge
dual of a 2-form in 3 dimensions is a 1-form.
8 Note that since A is not a tensor, the covariant derivative acts on it with an extra 1 factor which
2
then ensures that F is a tensor. This also applies to A and F below.

which gives us the symplectic form

Here, Σ is a spatial slice as defined in Section 2.2. Furthermore, we can write the

S [A, e] =
e · F − d (A · e) .

This is the action for 2+1D gravity, with an additional boundary term (which is usually
disregarded by assuming M has no boundary). Using the identity δF = dA δA, we find
the variation of the action is

(3.14)
δS [A, e] =
F · δe + T · δA − d (e · δA + A · δe) ,

and thus we see that the equations of motion are

Of course, (3.15) and (3.16) may also be derived from (3.9) and (3.10).

we use the following identities, derived from the properties of the dot product (2.11) and the
graded commutator:
A · dA = e · de = [e, e] = A · [A, A] = e · [A, e] = 0.

The Hamiltonian Formulation10

To go to the Hamiltonian formulation, we would like to reduce everything to the spatial slice Σ. Since the symplectic potential is already defined on the spatial slice, it
stay!s the same. Let us write the curvature and torsion 2-form components explicitly
using the spatial indices:
F≡

1 i

We also define the 3-dimensional spacetime Levi-Civita symbol ẽµνρ , which is a tensor
of density weight 1 with upper indices or −1 with lower indices11 , and is related to
the 2-dimensional spatial Levi-Civita symbol by ẽ ab ≡ ẽ0ab . The action becomes:

10 This

derivation is based on the one in [4].
spacetime and spatial Levi-Civita symbols, which are tensor densities, must be distinguished
from the internal space Levi-Civita symbol eijk ; the internal space is flat, and thus the notion of tensor
density is irrelevant in this case.
12 For convenience, we use the same notation as for the 2+1-dimensional quantities; however, since
from now on we will use the 2-dimensional quantities exclusively, this should not result in any confusion.
11 The

The third term, 12 ∂0 A · e, includes the only time derivative, and from it we can read
that A is the configuration variable and e is the conjugate momentum. Therefore, the
Poisson brackets are

(3.22)
Aia ( x ) , eb (y) = ẽab δij δ ( x, y) .
From the first two terms we can now read the constraints, implying vanishing curvature and torsion on the spatial slice Σ:
F = 0,

T = 0.

(3.23)

Of course, these are the same as the equations of motion (3.15). Note that e0 and A0 are
Lagrange multipliers, since they have no terms with time derivatives. We may relabel
them φ and θ respectively and define the smeared Gauss constraint G and the smeared
curvature constraint F:

Phase Space Polarizations and Teleparallel Gravity

The symplectic potential (3.16) results in the symplectic form
ˆ
Ω ≡ δΘ = − δe · δA.
Σ

(3.25)

In fact, one may obtain the same symplectic form using a family of potentials of the
form
ˆ
Θλ = − ((1 − λ) e · δA + λA · δe) ,
(3.26)
Σ

where the parameter λ ∈ [0, 1] determines the polarization of the phase space. This
potential may be obtained from a family of actions of the form
ˆ
Sλ =
(3.27)
(e · F − λd (A · e)) ,
M

where the difference lies only in the boundary term and thus does not affect the
physics. Hence the choice of polarization does not matter in the continuum, but it
will be very important in the discrete theory, as we will see below.
The equations of motion (or constraints, in the Hamiltonian formulation) for any action of the form (3.27) are, as we have seen:
• The torsion (or Gauss) constraint T = 0,
• The curvature constraint F = 0.

19

Now, recall that general relativity is formulated using the Levi-Civita connection, which
is torsionless by definition. Thus, the torsion constraint T = 0 can really be seen as
defining the connection A to be torsionless, and thus selecting the theory to be general
relativity. In this case, F = 0 is the true equation of motion, describing the dynamics
of the theory.
In the teleparallel formulation of gravity we instead use the Weitzenböck connection, which
is defined to be flat but not necessarily torsionless. In this formulation, we interpret
the curvature constraint F = 0 as defining the connection A to be flat, while T = 0 is
the true equation of motion.
There are three cases of particular interest when considering the choice of the parameter λ. The case λ = 0 is the one most suitable for 2+1D general relativity:
ˆ
ˆ
S λ =0 =
e · F,
Θλ=0 = − e · δA,
(3.28)

M

since it indeed produces the familiar action for 2+1D gravity. The case λ = 1/2 is one
most suitable for 2+1D Chern-Simons theory:

ˆ 
ˆ

Sλ = 1 =
(e · δA + A · δe) ,

since it corresponds to the Chern-Simons action (3.13). Finally, the case λ = 1 is one
most suitable for 2+1D teleparallel gravity:
ˆ
ˆ
S λ =1 =
Θλ=1 = − A · δe,
(3.30)
(e · F − d (A · e)) ,
Σ

M

as explained in [58].
Further details about the different polarizations may be found in [17]. However, the
discretization procedure in that paper did not take into account possible curvature and
torsion degrees of freedom. In this thesis, we will include these degrees of freedom
and discuss all possible polarizations of the phase space.
From now on, we will always deal with the full family of discretizations λ ∈ [0, 1] in
all generality, instead of choosing a particular polarization. We will do this both in
2+1D and 3+1D. Although the different choices of polarization are entirely equivalent
in the continuum, they become very important in the discrete theory, and in fact, as
we will see, the choices λ = 1 and λ = 0 lead to completely different and independent
discretizations.

Gauge Transformations and Edge Modes

4.1

Euclidean Gauge Transformations

In this section we will work with the choice λ = 0, such that the action and symplectic
potential are given by (3.28):
ˆ
ˆ
(4.1)
e · F,
Θ = − e · δA,
S=
Σ

M

From the smeared constraints (3.24), one can check that the curvature constraint F
generates translations, while the Gauss constraint G generates rotations. Together,
they generate Euclidean gauge transformations
A 7→ g−1 Ag + g−1 dg,

e 7→ g−1 (e + dA z) g,

(4.2)

where g is a G-valued 0-form encoding rotations, and z is a g∗ -valued 0-form encoding
translations; pure rotations correspond to z = 0 and pure translations correspond to
g = 1.. Under this transformation, the curvature and torsion transform as
F 7→ g−1 Fg,

T 7→ g−1 (T + [F, z]) g,

(4.3)

and the action (4.1) transforms as13
ˆ
S 7→ S +

z · F.

(4.5)

∂M

We see that the action is invariant up to a boundary term, which vanishes on-shell due
to the equation of motion F = 0. As for the symplectic potential, we have14
δA 7→ g−1 (δA + dA ∆g) g,
and therefore the symplectic potential in (4.1) transforms as
ˆ
Θ 7→ Θ −
(e · dA ∆g + dA z · δA + dA z · dA ∆g) .
Σ

(4.6)

(4.7)

However, we may write15

13 Here

e · dA ∆g = T · ∆g − d (e · ∆g) ,

(4.8)

[A, z] · [A, A] = −z · [A, [A, A]] = 0

(4.4)

we used the fact that

due to the Jacobi identity, and thus dA z · F = d (z · F).

(4.9)

dA z · dA ∆g = [F, z] · ∆g − d (dA z · ∆g) .

(4.10)

Using these relations, the transformed potential may be written as
ˆ
ˆ
Θ 7→ Θ −
(z · δA − (e + dA z) · ∆g) .
((T + [F, z]) · ∆g − z · δF) −
Σ

(4.11)

∂Σ

The first integral vanishes on-shell, after both equations of motion F = T = 0 are
taken into account. The second integral is a (1-dimensional) boundary term, which
does not vanish on-shell. Usually we assume that Σ is a manifold without boundary,
and therefore this term may be neglected; however, here we will allow Σ to have a
non-empty boundary.

4.2

Edge Modes

We may make the symplectic potential invariant under the Euclidean transformation
by defining two new fields, a G-valued 0-form h and a g∗ -valued 0-form x, which are
defined to transform under the gauge transformation with parameters ( g, z) as follows
[29, 4]:
h 7→ g−1 h,
x 7→ g−1 (x − z) g.
(4.12)
We shall call them edge modes. The reason for defining them in this way is that they
cancel the gauge transformation, in the following sense. Using these fields, we may
define the dressed connection and frame field, labeled16 by a hat:
Â ≡ h−1 Ah + h−1 dh,

ê ≡ h−1 (e + dA x) h.

(4.13)

These are simply the original A and e, having already undergone a Euclidean transformation with the new fields h and x as parameters. It is easy to check that, due to
the way we chose the transformation of the fields h and x, the dressed connection and
frame field are invariant under any further gauge transformations, since the transformations of h and x exactly cancel out the transformations of A and e:
Â 7→ Â,

ê 7→ ê.

(4.14)

The dressed curvature and torsion are

1
Â, Â = h−1 Fh,
2


T̂ ≡ dÂ ê = dê + Â, ê = h−1 (T + [F, x]) h,
F̂ ≡ dÂ Â = dÂ +

(4.15)
(4.16)

and they are also invariant under Euclidean transformations,
F̂ 7→ F̂,
16 The

hat, being a piece of clothing, is the natural choice to indicate dressed variables.

note the similarity to (4.5). By design, this action is invariant17 under Euclidean transformations. Similarly, we have the dressed symplectic potential:

where as usual ∆h ≡ δhh−1 , and we used the identity
δÂ = h−1 (δA + dA ∆h) h.

(4.19)

dressed potential as

Delta Functions and Differential Solid Angles

Let us first prove an interesting result that we will use below. Consider an n-dimensional
flat Euclidean manifold. Let us define the volume n-form
e≡

1
ea ···a dx a1 ∧ · · · ∧ dx an = dx1 ∧ · · · ∧ dx n = dn x,
n! 1 n

(5.1)

where ea1 ···an is the Levi-Civita symbol. We also define a radial coordinate
r2 ≡ x a x a ,

(5.2)

such that
 
d r2 = 2r dr = 2x a dx a
17 It

=⇒

dr =

x a dx a .
r

(5.3)

was already invariant under rotations, but now it is invariant under translations as well; this is
why the edge mode h does not explicitly appear in the action.

23

Taking the Hodge dual18 of this 1-form, we get an (n − 1)-form:

? dr =

1
1 a
x eaa1 ···an−1 dx a1 ∧ · · · ∧ dx an−1 .
( n − 1) ! r

(5.9)

On the other hand, we have from the definition of the Hodge dual
dr ∧ ?dr = hdr, dr ie = e,

18 The

Hodge dual of a p-form B on an n-dimensional manifold is the (n − p)-form ? B defined such
that, for any p-form A,
A ∧ ? B = h A, Bie,
(5.4)
where e is the volume n-form defined above, and h A, Bi is the symmetric inner product of p-forms,
defined as
1
h A, Bi ≡ A a1 ···a p Ba1 ···a p .
(5.5)
p!

? is called the Hodge star operator. In terms of indices, the Hodge dual is given by
(? B)b1 ···bn− p =

1
Ba ··· a e a1 ··· a p b1 ···bn− p ,
p! 1 p

(5.6)

and its action on basis p-forms is given by

? (dx a1 ∧ · · · ∧ dx a p ) ≡

1
e a1 ··· a p b1 ···bn− p dx b1 ∧ · · · ∧ dx bn− p .
(n − p)!

(5.7)

Interestingly, we have that ?1 = e. Also, if acting with the Hodge star on a p-forms twice, we get

?2 = sign ( g) (−1) p(n− p) ,
where sign ( g) is the signature of the metric: +1 for Euclidean or −1 for Lorentzian signature.

24

(5.8)

Similarly, for n = 3 with x3 ≡ z we have the 2-form

? dr =

1

x eabc dx b ∧ dx c = ( x dy ∧ dz + y dz ∧ dx + zdx ∧ dy) .

Using the coordinate φ and the additional coordinate

θ ≡ arccos

r
we find

? dr = r2 sin θ dθ ∧ dφ.

(5.17)

Thus, we see that we indeed recover the usual volume elements for spherical coordinates in 2 and 3 dimensions using dr ∧ ?dr.
Now, let us define, in n dimensions, the (n − 1)-form
Ω≡

which gives the differential solid angle of an n-sphere, for example:
(

Therefore the two terms cancel each other, and we get that
dΩ = 0.
25

(5.22)

Note that this applies everywhere except at the origin, r = 0, since Ω is undefined
there. On the other hand, if we integrate over the n-dimensional ball Bn , we find by
Stokes’ theorem

Ω = A n −1 ,

where Sn−1 ≡ ∂Bn is the (n − 1)-sphere and An−1 is its area such that e.g. for n = 2, 3
we have:
A1 = 2π,
A2 = 4π.
(5.24)
The n-form dΩ is zero everywhere except at r = 0, yet its integral over an n-dimensional
volume is finite. In other words, it behaves just like a Dirac delta function. We thus conclude that
dΩ = An−1 δ(n) ,
(5.25)
where δ(n) is an n-form distribution such that, for a 0-form f ,
ˆ
f δ ( n ) = f (0) .

(5.26)

In particular, for n = 2, 3, we find that

5.2

d (dφ) = d2 φ = 2πδ(2) ,

(5.27)

d (sin θ dθ ∧ dφ) = −d2 (cos θ dφ) = 4πδ(3) .

(5.28)

Particles as Topological Defects

In the following sections we will follow the formalism of [59, 60, 61, 62, 63]. Consider
2+1D polar coordinates (t, r, φ) with the following metric:
ds2 = − (dt + S dφ)2 +

dr2

(1 − M )

2

+ r2 dφ2 .

(5.29)

Here, M ∈ [0, 1) is a “mass” and S is a “spin”, and they are both constant real numbers.
Let us now transform to the following coordinates:
T ≡ t + Sφ,

R≡

r
,
1−M

Φ ≡ (1 − M) φ.

(5.30)

Then the metric becomes flat:
ds2 = −dT 2 + dR2 + R2 dΦ2 .

(5.31)

However, the periodicity condition φ ∼ φ + 2π becomes
T ∼ T + 2πS,

Φ ∼ Φ + 2π (1 − M) .
26

(5.32)

The identification Φ ∼ Φ + 2π (1 − M) means that in a plane of constant T, as we go
around the origin, we find that it only takes us 2π (1 − M) radians to complete a full
circle, rather than 2π radians. Therefore we have obtained a “Pac-Man”-like surface,
where the angle of the “mouth” is 2πM, and both ends of the “mouth” are glued to
each other. This produces a cone with deficit angle 2πM. Note that if M = 0 and S = 0,
the particle is indistinguishable from flat spacetime.
If the spin S is non-zero, one end of the mouth is identified with the other end, but at
a different point in time – there is a time shift of 2πS. This seems like it might create
closed timelike curves, which would lead to causality violations [64]. However, when
the spin is due to internal orbital angular momentum, the source itself would need
to be larger than the radius of any closed timelike curves [61, 65]; thus, no causality
violations take place.

5.3

The Frame Field and Spin Connection

Let us now describe this geometry using a spin connection 1-form A ≡ Aiµ Ji dx µ and a
frame field 1-form e ≡ eiµ Pi dx µ as above. For the frame field it is simplest to take
e0 = dT,

e1 = dR,

e2 = R dΦ,

(5.33)

or in index-free notation
e = P0 dT + P1 dR + R P2 dΦ.

(5.34)

To find the spin connection A, we define, as above, the torsion 2-form T:
T ≡ dA e = de + [A, e]

=⇒

T i = dei + ei jk A j ∧ ek .

(5.35)

The spin connection is the defined as the choice of A for which T = 0. Explicitly, the
components of the torsion are:
T 0 = A1 ∧ R dΦ − A2 ∧ dR,

(5.36)

T 1 = A2 ∧ dT − A0 ∧ R dΦ,

(5.37)

T 2 = R d2 Φ + dR ∧ dΦ + A0 ∧ dR − A1 ∧ dT.

(5.38)

Note that we have written the 2-form d2 Φ explicitly, since Φ is not well-defined at
R = 0, and thus we are not guaranteed to have d2 Φ = 0. However, as we showed in
Chapter 5.1,
d2 Φ = 2πδ(2) (R) dX ∧ dY = 2πδ ( R) dR ∧ dΦ,
(5.39)
where R is the position vector with magnitude R, δ ( R) ≡ R δ(2) (R), X ≡ R cos Φ, and
Y ≡ R sin Φ. Therefore, R d2 Φ is evaluated at R = 0, and this term vanishes.

27

It is easy to see that, if we want T to vanish, all of the components of A must vanish
except for A0 , which must take the value A0 = dΦ in order to cancel the dR ∧ dΦ
term. Thus we get that
A = J0 dΦ.
(5.40)
Calculating the curvature F of the spin connection, we get
F ≡ dA A = dA +

1
[A, A] = J0 d2 Φ = 2πδ ( R) J0 dR ∧ dΦ,
2

(5.41)

so the curvature is distributional, and vanishes everywhere except at R = 0.
Finally, we transform back from the coordinates ( T, R, Φ) to (t, r, φ) using (5.30). The
spin connection becomes:
A = (1 − M) J0 dφ,
(5.42)
and the frame field becomes:
e = P0 dt +

P1 dr
+ (SP0 + rP2 ) dφ.
1−M

(5.43)

In the new coordinates, we find that the curvature and torsion are both distributional:
F = (1 − M ) J0 d2 φ = 2π (1 − M) δ (r ) J0 dr ∧ dφ,

(5.44)

T = S P0 d2 φ = 2πS δ (r ) P0 dr ∧ dφ.

(5.45)

Let us define M ≡ (1 − M ) J0 and S ≡ SP0 ; note that [M, S] = 0. Then we may write
A = M dφ,

e = P0 dt +

1
P1 dr + (S + rP2 ) dφ,
1−M

(5.46)

T = 2πS δ (r ) dr ∧ dφ.

(5.47)

R = 2πM δ (r ) dr ∧ dφ,

The equations of motion (or constraints) of 2+1D gravity, F = T = 0, are satisfied
everywhere except at the origin. This means that there is a matter source (i.e. a righthand side to the Einstein equation) at the origin, which is of course the particle itself.

5.4

The Dressed Quantities

The expressions for A and e are not invariant under the gauge transformation
A 7→ h−1 Ah + h−1 dh,
F 7→ h−1 Fh,

e 7→ h−1 (e + dA x) h,

T 7→ h−1 (T + [F, x]) h,

(5.48)
(5.49)

where the gauge parameters are a G-valued 0-form h and a g∗ -valued 0-form x. When
we apply these transformations, we get:
A = h−1 Mh dφ + h−1 dh,
28

(5.50)

e = h−1 (dx + (S + [M, x]) dφ) h,

(5.51)

F = 2πh−1 Mh δ (r ) dr ∧ dφ,

(5.52)

T = 2πh−1 (S + [M, x]) h δ (r ) dr ∧ dφ.

(5.53)

These expressions are gauge-invariant, since any additional gauge transformation will
give the same expression with the new gauge parameters composed with the old ones,
much like the dressed variables we defined in Section 4.2.
Below we will use a coordinate φ which is scaled by 2π, such that it has the range [0, 1)
instead of [0, 2π ). In this case, we have that
d2 Φ = δ ( R) dR ∧ dΦ,

(5.54)

and thus the expressions for the curvature and torsion are simplified:
F = h−1 Mh δ (r ) dr ∧ dφ,

(5.55)

T = h−1 (S + [M, x]) h δ (r ) dr ∧ dφ.

(5.56)

Finally, let us define a momentum p and angular momentum j:
p ≡ h−1 Mh,

j ≡ h−1 (S + [M, x]) h,

(5.57)

which satisfy, as one would expect, the relations
p2 ≡ M2 ,

p · j = M · S.

(5.58)

Then we have
F = p δ (r ) dr ∧ dφ,

T = j δ (r ) dr ∧ dφ.

(5.59)

We see that the source of curvature is momentum, while the source of torsion is angular momentum, as discussed in [24, 57, 62, 23, 66, 25].

2+1 Dimensions: The Discrete Theory
6
6.1

The Discrete Geometry
The Cellular Decomposition and Its Dual

We embed a cellular decomposition ∆ and a dual cellular decomposition ∆∗ in our
2-dimensional spatial manifold Σ. These structures consist of the following elements,
where each element of ∆ is uniquely dual to an element of ∆∗ :
∆
0-cells (vertices) v
1-cells (edges) e
2-cells (cells) c

∆∗
dual to 2-cells (faces) v∗
dual to 1-cells (links) e∗
dual to 0-cells (nodes) c∗

The 1-skeleton graph Γ ⊂ ∆ is the set of all vertices and edges of ∆. Its dual is the spin
network graph Γ∗ ⊂ ∆∗ , the set of all nodes and links of ∆∗ . Both graphs are oriented,
and we write e = (vv0 ) to indicate that the edge e starts at the vertex v and ends at
∗
v0 , and e∗ = (cc0 ) to indicate that the link e∗ starts at the node c∗ and ends at c0∗ .
Furthermore, since edges are where two cells intersect, we write e = (cc0 ) ≡ ∂c ∩ ∂c0
to denote that the edge e is the intersection of the boundaries ∂c and ∂c0 of the cells
c and c0 respectively. If the link e∗ is dual to the edge e, then we have that e = (cc0 )
∗
and e∗ = (cc0 ) ; therefore the notation is consistent. This construction is illustrated in
Figure 1.
For the purpose of doing calculations, it will prove useful to introduce disks D̄v around
each vertex v. The disks have a radius R, small enough that the entire disk D̄v is inside
the face v∗ for every v. We also define punctured disks Dv , which are obtained from the
full disks D̄v by removing the vertex v, which is at the center, and a cut Cv , connecting
v to an arbitrary point v0 on the boundary ∂ D̄v . Thus19
Dv ≡ D̄v \Cv .

(6.1)

The punctured disks are equipped
with a cylindrical coordinate system (rv , φv ) such


that rv ∈ (0, R) and φv ∈ αv − 21 , αv + 12 ; note that φv is scaled by 2π, so it has a
period of 1, for notational brevity. The boundary of the punctured disk is such that
∂Dv = ∂0 Dv ∪ Cv ∪ ∂ R Dv ∪ C̄v ,

(6.2)

where ∂0 Dv is the inner boundary at rv = 0, Cv is the cut at φv = αv − 21 going from
rv = 0 to rv = R, ∂ R Dv is the outer boundary at rv = R, and C̄v is the other side of the

where Nv is the number of cells around v and the cells are enumerated c1 , . . . , c Nv .

that

∂c =

(6.4)

where Nc is the number of cells adjacent to c or, equivalently, the number of vertices

6.2

Classical Spin Networks

Our goal is to show that, by discretizing the continuous phase space, we may obtain
the spin network phase space of loop quantum gravity. Let us therefore begin by studying
this phase space.
6.2.1

The Spin Network Phase Space

In the previous section, we defined the spin network Γ∗ as a collection of links e∗
connecting nodes c∗ . The kinematical spin network phase space is isomorphic to a
direct product of T ∗ G cotangent bundles for each link e∗ ∈ Γ∗ :
PΓ∗ ≡

T ∗ G.
∏
∗
∗

(6.5)

e ∈Γ

Since T ∗ G ∼
= G n g∗ , the phase space variables are a group element he∗ ∈ G and a Lie
algebra element Xe∗ ∈ g∗ for each link e∗ ∈ Γ∗ . Under orientation reversal of the link
e∗ we have
1
1
he∗−1 = h−
Xe∗−1 = −h−
(6.6)
e∗ X e∗ h e∗ .
e∗ ,
These variables satisfy the Poisson algebra derived in the next section:

{he∗ , he0∗ } = 0,

j

{ Xei ∗ , Xe0∗ } = δe∗ e0∗ eij k Xek∗ ,

{ Xei ∗ , he0∗ } = δe∗ e0∗ he∗ Ji ,

where e∗ and e0∗ are two links and Ji are the generators of g.
The symplectic potential is
Θ = ∑ ∆he∗ · Xe∗ ,
e∗ ∈Γ∗

19 Note

that v, v0 ∈ Cv .

32

(6.7)

(6.8)

where we used the graded dot product defined in Section 2.4 and the Maurer-Cartan
form defined in (2.20). This phase space enjoys the action of the gauge group G N ,
where N is the number of nodes in Γ∗ . This action is generated by the discrete Gauss
constraint at each node,
G c ≡ ∑ X e∗ ,
(6.9)
e∗ 3c∗

where e∗ 3 c∗ means “all links e∗ connected to the node c∗ ”. This means that the sum
of the fluxes vanishes when summed over all the links connected to the node c∗ . Later
∗
we will see a nicer interpretation of this constraint. Given a link e∗ = (cc0 ) , the action
of the Gauss constraint is given in terms of two group elements gc , gc0 ∈ G, one at each
node, as
he∗ 7→ gc he∗ gc−0 1 ,
Xe∗ 7→ gc Xe∗ gc−1 .
(6.10)
6.2.2

Calculation of the Poisson Brackets

Let us calculate the Poisson brackets of the spin network phase space T ∗ G, for one
link. For the Maurer-Cartan form, we use the notation
θ ≡ −∆h ≡ −δhh−1 .

(6.11)

This serves two purposes: first, we can talk about the components θ i of θ without the
notation getting too cluttered, and second, from (2.22), the Maurer-Cartan form thus
defined satisfies the Maurer-Cartan structure equation
F (θ) ≡ δθ θ ≡ δθ +

1
[θ, θ] = 0,
2

(6.12)

where F (θ) is the curvature of θ. Note that θ is a g-valued 1-form on field space, and
we also have a g∗ -valued 0-form X, the flux. We take a set of vector fields qi and pi for
i ∈ {1, 2, 3} which are chosen to satisfy
q j y θ i = p j y δX i = δiJ ,

p j y θ i = q j y δX i = 0,

(6.13)

where y is the usual interior product on differential forms20 . The symplectic potential
on one link is taken to be
Θ = −θ · X,
(6.15)
20 The

interior product V y A of a vector V with a p-form A, sometimes written ιV A and sometimes
called the contraction of V with A, is the ( p − 1)-form with components

(V y A) a2 ···a p ≡ V a1 A a1 ···a p .

33

(6.14)

and its symplectic form is

the second line we used (6.12). In components, we have
1
Ω = δXk ∧ θ k + eijk θ i ∧ θ j X k .
2

(6.16)

Now, recall the definition of the Hamiltonian vector field of f : it is the vector field H f
satisfying
H f y Ω = −δ f .
(6.17)
Let us contract the vector field qi with Ω using q j y θ i = δiJ and q j y δX i = 0:

Thus, we can construct the Hamiltonian vector field for X i :
H Xi ≡ qi − eijk p j X k ,

H Xi y Ω = −δXi .

(6.20)

As for h, we consider explicitly the matrix components in the fundamental representation, h AB . The Hamiltonian vector field for the component h AB satisfies, by definition,
Hh A y Ω = −δh AB .

6.3.1

Truncating the Geometry to the Vertices
Motivation

Before the equations of motion (i.e. the curvature and torsion constraints F = T = 0)
are applied, the geometry on Σ can have arbitrary curvature and torsion. We would
like to capture the “essence” of the curvature and torsion and encode them on codimension 2 defects.
For this purpose, we can imagine looking at every possible loop on the spin network
graph Γ∗ and taking a holonomy in G n g∗ around it. This holonomy will have a
part valued in g, which will encode the curvature, and a part valued in g∗ , which will
encode the torsion.
A loop of the spin network is the boundary ∂v∗ of a face v∗ . Since the face is dual to
a vertex v, the natural place to encode the geometry would be at the vertex. Thus, we
will place the defects at the vertices, and give them the appropriate values in g ⊕ g∗
obtained by the holonomies.
The disks D̄v defined above are in a 1-to-1 correspondence with the faces v∗ . In fact, we
can imagine deforming the disks such that they cover the faces, and their boundaries
∂ D̄v are exactly the loops ∂v∗ . Thus, we may perform calculations on the disks instead
on the faces.
This intuitive and qualitative motivation will be made precise in the following sections.
6.3.2

The Chern-Simons Connection on the Disks and Cells

We define the Chern-Simons21 connection on the punctured disk Dv as follows:

A

Dv

≡ H̊v−1 dH̊v ≡ Hv−1 dHv + Hv−1 Mv Hv dφv ,

(6.28)

where:
• H̊v is a non-periodic G n g∗ -valued 0-form defined as H̊v ≡ eMv φv Hv ,
• Hv is a periodic22 G n g∗ -valued 0-form,
• Mv is a constant element of the Cartan subalgebra23 h ⊕ h∗ of g ⊕ g∗ .
that, as explained in Section 2.1, we use calligraphic font to denote forms valued in G n g∗ ,
and bold calligraphic font for forms valued in its Lie algebra g ⊕ g∗ .
22 By “periodic” we mean that, under φ 7 → φ + 1, the non-periodic variable H̊ gets an additional
v
factor of eMv due to the term eMv φv , while the periodic variable Hv is invariant. (Recall that we are
scaling φ by 2π, so the period is 1 and not 2π.)
23 The Cartan subalgebra of a complex semisimple Lie algebra is a maximal commutative subalgebra,
and it is unique up to automorphisms. The number of generators in the Cartan subalgebra is the rank
of the algebra.
21 Recall

36

Note that this connection is related by a gauge transformation of the form A0 7→
Hv−1 dHv + Hv−1 A0 Hv to a connection A0 defined as follows:

A0 ≡ Mv dφv .

(6.29)

The connection A0 satisfies [A0 , A0 ] = 0, so its curvature is F 0 ≡ dA0 . This curvature vanishes everywhere on the punctured disk (which excludes the point v), since
d2 φv = 0. However, at the origin of our coordinate system, i.e. the vertex v, φv is not
well-defined, so we cannot guarantee that F 0 vanishes at v itself. Indeed, as we have
seen in chapter 5, the curvature in this case will be a delta function. In addition to the
rigorous proof of Chapter 5.1, we can now demonstrate the delta-function behavior of
the curvature explicitly. If we integrate the curvature on the full disk D̄v using Stokes’
theorem, we get:

where ∂ D̄v dφv = 1 since we are using coordinates scaled by 2π, and we used the fact
that Mv is constant. We conclude that, since F 0 vanishes everywhere on Dv , and yet
it integrates to a finite value at D̄v , the curvature F 0 must take the form of a Dirac
delta function centered at v:
F 0 = Mv δ (v) ,
(6.31)
where δ (v) is a distributional 2-form such that for any 0-form f ,
ˆ
f δ (v) ≡ f (v) .
Σ

(6.32)

The final step is to gauge-transform back from A0 to the initial connection A defined
in (6.28). The curvature transforms in the usual way, F 0 7→ Hv−1 F 0 Hv ≡ F , so we
get
F D̄ = Hv−1 Mv Hv δ (v) ≡ P v δ (v) ,
(6.33)
v

where we defined

P v ≡ Hv−1 Mv Hv .

(6.34)

Note again that, while F D̄ (on the full disk) does not vanish, F D (on the punctured
v
v
disk) does vanish.
Now that we have defined A on the punctured disks Dv , we may define it on the cells
c simply by treating the cell as a disk without a puncture, taking Mv = 0 and v 7→ c
in 6.28:
A c ≡ Hc−1 dHc ,
(6.35)
where Hc is a G n g∗ -valued 0-form. This is a flat connection with F = 0 everywhere
inside c.

6.3.3

The Connection and Frame Field on the Disks and Cells

Now that we have defined the Chern-Simons connection 1-form A and found its curvature F on the disks, we split A into a g-valued connection 1-form A a g∗ -valued
frame field 1-form e as defined in (3.2). Similarly, we split F into a g-valued curvature
2-form F and a g∗ -valued torsion 2-form T as defined in (3.5).
From (3.2) we get:
1
1
A D = h̊−
e D = h̊−
(6.36)
v dh̊v ,
v dx̊v h̊v ,
v

v

where:
• h̊v is a non-periodic G-valued 0-form and x̊v is a non-periodic g∗ -valued 0-form
such that
h̊v ≡ eMv φv hv ,
x̊v ≡ eMv φv (xv + Sv φv ) e−Mv φv ,
(6.37)
• hv is a periodic G-valued 0-form,
• xv is a periodic g∗ -valued 0-form,
• Mv is a constant element of the Cartan subalgebra h of g,
• Sv is a constant element of the Cartan subalgebra h∗ of g∗ ,
• By construction [Mv , Sv ] = 0.
The full expressions for A and e on Dv in terms of hv and xv are as follows:
A

Dv

1
−1
= h−
v dhv + hv Mv hv dφv ,

e

Dv

1
−1
= h−
v dxv hv + hv ( Sv + [ Mv , xv ]) hv dφv .
(6.38)

Furthermore, from (3.5) we get:
F

D̄v

= pv δ (v) ,

T

D̄v

= jv δ (v) ,

(6.39)

where pv , jv represent the momentum and angular momentum respectively:
1
pv ≡ h−
v Mv hv ,

1
jv ≡ h−
v ( Sv + [ Mv , xv ]) hv .

(6.40)

In terms of pv and jv , we may write A and e on the disk as follows:
A

Dv

1
= h−
v dhv + pv dφv ,

e

Dv

1
= h−
v dxv hv + jv dφv .

(6.41)

It is clear that the first term in each definition is flat and torsionless, while the second
term (involving pv and jv respectively) is the one which contributes to the curvature
and torsion at v. Since the punctured disk Dv does not include v itself, the curvature
and torsion vanish everywhere on it:
F

Dv

= 0,

T
38

Dv

= 0.

(6.42)

As before, while F and T do not vanish on the full disk D̄v , they do vanish on Dv . We
call this type of geometry a piecewise flat and torsionless geometry24 . Given a particular spin network Γ∗ , and assuming that information about the curvature and torsion
may only be obtained by taking holonomies along the loops of this spin network, the
piecewise flat and torsionless geometry carries, at least intuitively, the exact same information as the arbitrary geometry we had before.
As for the Chern-Simons connection, the expressions for A and e on c are obtained by
taking Mv = Sv = 0 and v 7→ c in (6.38):
1
e c = h−
c dxc hc ,

1
A c = h−
c dhc ,

(6.43)

where hc is a G-valued 0-form and xc is a g∗ -valued 0-form. Of course, by construction, the curvature and torsion associated to this connection and frame field vanish
everywhere in the cell:
F c = 0,
T c = 0.
(6.44)

6.4

The Continuity Conditions

6.4.1

Continuity Conditions Between Cells
∗

Let us consider the link e∗ = (cc0 ) connecting two adjacent nodes c∗ and c0∗ . This
link is dual to the edge e = (cc0 ) = c ∩ c0 , which is the boundary between the two
adjacent cells c and c0 . The connection is defined in the union c ∪ c0 , while in each cell
its restriction is encoded in A c and A c0 as defined above, in terms of Hc and Hc0
respectively.
The continuity equation on the edge (cc0 ) between the two adjacent cells reads

on cc0 = c ∩ c0 .
(6.45)
A c = Hc−1 dHc = Hc−0 1 dHc0 = A c0 ,
Since the connections match, this means that the group elements Hc and Hc0 differ
only by the action of a left symmetry element. This implies that there exists a group
element Hcc0 ∈ G n g∗ which is independent of x and provides the change of variables
between the two parametrizations Hc ( x ) and Hc0 ( x ) on the overlap:

Hc0 ( x ) = Hc0 c Hc ( x ) ,
x ∈ cc0 = c ∩ c0 .
(6.46)
−1
Note that Hc0 c = Hcc
0 . Furthermore, H cc0 can be decomposed as

Hcc0 = Hc ( x ) Hc−0 1 ( x ) ,

(6.47)

as illustrated in Figure 3.
We can decompose the continuity conditions into rotational and translational holonomies
using the rules outlined in Section 2.7:



0
h c0 ( x ) = h c0 c h c ( x ) ,
xc0 ( x ) = hc0 c xc ( x ) − xcc hcc0 ,
x ∈ cc0 .
(6.48)
24 The

question of whether the geometry we have defined here has a notion of a “continuum limit”,
e.g. by shrinking the loops to points such that the discrete defects at the vertices become continuous
curvature and torsion, is left for future work.

Figure 3: To get from the node c∗ to the adjacent node c0∗ , we use the group
element Hcc0 . First, we choose a point x somewhere on the edge (cc0 ) =
c ∩ c0 . Then, we take Hc ( x ) from c∗ to x, following the first red arrow.
Finally, we take Hc−0 1 ( x ) from x to c0∗ , following the second red arrow. Thus
Hcc0 = Hc ( x ) Hc−0 1 ( x ). Note that any x ∈ c ∩ c0 will do, since the connection
is flat and thus all paths are equivalent.
6.4.2

Continuity Conditions Between Disks and Cells

A similar discussion applies when one looks at the overlap Dv ∩ c between a punctured disk Dv and a cell c. The boundary of this region consists of two truncated edges
of length R (the coordinate radius of the disk) touching v, plus an arc connecting the
two edges, which lies on the boundary of the disk Dv . In the following we denote this
arc25 by (vc). It is clear that the union of all such arcs around a vertex v reconstructs
the outer boundary ∂ R Dv of the disk, as defined in Section 6.1:

(vc) ≡ ∂ R Dv ∩ c,

∂ R Dv =

[

(vc) ,

(6.49)

c3v

where c 3 v means “all cells c which have the vertex v on their boundary”. In the
intersection Dv ∩ c we have two different descriptions of the connection A. On c it
is described by the G n g∗ -valued 0-form Hc , and on Dv it is described by a G n g∗ valued 0-form Hv . The fact that we have a single-valued connection is expressed in
the continuity conditions

A

= Hv−1 Mv Hv dφv + Hv−1 dHv = Hc−1 dHc = A c ,

on (vc) = ∂Dv ∩ c.
(6.50)
The relation between the two connections can be integrated. It means that the elements
Hv ( x ) and Hc ( x ) differ by the action of the left symmetry group. In practice, this
means that the integrated continuity relation involves a (discrete) holonomy Hcv :
Dv

Hc ( x ) = Hcv eMv φv (x) Hv ( x ) ,

x ∈ (vc)

(6.51)

arc (vc) is dual to the line segment (vc)∗ connecting the vertex v with the node c∗ , just as the
edge e is dual to the link e∗ .

Hcv

(6.52)
which is illustrated in Figure 4.

Figure 4: To get from the vertex v to the node c∗ , we use the group element
Hvc . First, we choose a point x somewhere on the arc (vc) = ∂Dv ∩ c. Then,
we use eMv φv ( x) to rotate from the cut Cv to the angle corresponding to x
(rotation not illustrated). Next, we take Hv ( x ) from v to x, following the
first red arrow. Finally, we take Hc−1 ( x ) from x to c∗ , following the second
red arrow. Thus Hvc = eMv φv ( x) Hv ( x ) Hc−1 ( x ).
As above, we can decompose the continuity conditions into rotational and translational holonomies using the rules outlined in Section 2.7:
hc = hcv h̊v ,

(6.53)

Gauge Transformations and Symmetries
Right and Left Translations

Let G be a G n g∗ -valued 0-form. Right translations

Hc ( x ) 7→ Hc ( x ) G ( x ) ,

(7.1)

are gauge transformations that affect the connection in the usual way:

A 7→ G −1 AG + G −1 dG .

(7.2)

We can also consider left translations

Hc ( x ) 7→ Gc Hc ( x ) ,
41

(7.3)

acting on Hc with a constant group element Gc ∈ G n g∗ . These transformations leave
the connection invariant, A 7→ A. On the one hand, they label the redundancy of
our parametrization of A in terms of Hc as discussed above. On the other hand, these
transformations can be understood as symmetries of our parametrization in terms of
group elements that stem from the existence of new degrees of freedom in Hc beyond
the ones in the connection A.
This situation is similar to the situation that arises any time one considers a gauge
theory in a region with boundaries. As shown in [29], when we subdivide a region of
space we need to add new degrees of freedom at the boundaries of the subdivision in
order to restore gauge invariance. These degrees of freedom are the edge modes, which
carry a non-trivial representation of the boundary symmetry group that descends from
the bulk gauge transformations. This description is equivalent to the one in [4], which
we described in Chapter 4 in the continuous context.
Now, we can invert (6.35) and write Hc using a path-ordered exponential as follows:
ˆ x
∗ −→
Hc ( x ) = Hc (c ) exp
A,
(7.4)
c∗

where Hc (c∗ ), the value of Hc at the node c∗ , is the extra information contained in the
edge mode field Hc that cannot be obtained from the connection A. Left translations
can thus be understood as simply translating the value of Hc (c∗ ) without affecting
the value of A.
As for the disks, we again see that gauge transformations are given by right translations
Hv ( x ) 7→ Hv ( x ) G ( x ) ,
(7.5)
while left translations by a constant element Gv in the Cartan subgroup (which thus
commutes with Mv ),
Hv ( x ) 7→ Gv Hv ( x ) ,
(7.6)
leave the connection invariant.

7.2

Invariant Holonomies

The quantity Hcc0 , given in (6.47) in the context of the continuity conditions, is invariant under the right gauge transformation (7.1), since it is independent of c. However,
it is not invariant under the left symmetry (7.3) performed at c and c0 , under which we
obtain
Hc0 c 7→ Gc0 Hc0 c Gc−1 .
(7.7)
Since this symmetry leaves the connection invariant, this means that Hcc0 is not the
holonomy from c∗ to c0∗ , along the link (cc0 )∗ , as it is usually assumed. Instead, from
(7.4) and (6.47) we have that
ˆ c0∗ !

−→
Hcc0 = Hc (c∗ ) exp
A Hc−0 1 c0∗
(7.8)
c∗

42

is a dressed gauge-invariant observable. It is a gauge-invariant version of the holonomy.
Similarly, the quantity Hvc is invariant under right gauge transformations (7.1) and
(7.5):
Hc ( x ) 7→ Gc Hc ( x ) ,
Hv ( x ) 7→ Gv Hv ( x ) .
(7.9)
However, under left symmetry transformations (7.3) and (7.6), the connection is left
invariant, and we get
Hvc 7→ Gv Hvc Gc−1 .
(7.10)
Note also that the translation in φv ( x ) can be absorbed into the definition of Hv , so
that the transformation
φv ( x ) 7→ φv ( x ) + β v ,

Hv ( x ) 7→ e−Mv β v Hv ( x ) ,

is also a symmetry under which (6.51) is invariant. The connection A
under this symmetry.

7.3

(7.11)
Dv

is invariant

Dressed Holonomies and Edge Modes

Our discussion of the transformations of the Chern-Simons connection also applies, of
1
course, to the connection A and frame field e. Consider the definition A c = h−
c dhc
for A in terms of hc . Note that A is invariant under the left action transformation
1
hc 7→ gc hc for some constant gc ∈ G. Thus, inverting the definition A c = h−
c dhc to
find hc in terms of A, we get
ˆ x
∗ −→
hc ( x ) = hc (c ) exp
A,
(7.12)
c∗

where hc (c∗ ) is a new degree of freedom which does not exist in A. The notation suggests that it is the holonomy “from c∗ to itself”, but it is in general not the identity! The
notation hc (c∗ ) is just a placeholder for the edge mode which “dresses” the holonomy.
For the “undressed” holonomy – which is simply the path-ordered exponential from
the node c∗ to some point x – we thus have
ˆ x
−
→
1 ∗
exp
A = h−
(7.13)
c (c ) hc ( x ) .
c∗

−1
Similarly, the definition A D = h−
v dhv + hv Mv hv dφv is invariant under hv 7 → gv hv ,
v
but only if gv is in H, the Cartan subgroup of G, since it must commute with Mv .

Inverting the relation A D = h̊−

From (7.13) and (7.15), we may construct general path-ordered exponentials from

Discretizing the Symplectic Potential
The Choice of Polarization

Recall that there is a family of symplectic potential given by (3.26):
ˆ
Θλ = − ((1 − λ) e · δA + λA · δe) .
Σ

44

(8.1)

We would like to replace A and e by their discretized expressions given by (6.43) and
(6.36). Before we do this for each cell and disk individually, let us consider a toy model
where we simply take A = h−1 dh and e = h−1 dxh for some G-valued 0-form h and
g∗ -valued 0-form x over the entire manifold Σ. We begin by calculating the variations
of these expressions, obtaining


δA = δ h−1 dh = h−1 (d∆h) h,
(8.2)


δe = δ h

−1



dxh = h−1 (dδx + [dx, ∆h]) h,

(8.3)

where ∆h ≡ δhh−1 for the Maurer-Cartan form on field space as defined in (2.20).
Thus, we have
ˆ 

Θλ = −
(8.4)
(1 − λ) dx · d∆h + λdhh−1 · (dδx + [dx, ∆h]) ,
Σ

where we used the cyclicity of the dot product, (2.18), to cancel some group elements.
Now, the first term is very simple; in fact, it is clearly an exact 2-form, and thus may
be easily integrated. However, the second term is complicated, and it is unclear if it
can be integrated. Nevertheless, we know that every choice of λ leads to the same
symplectic form:
ˆ
ˆ
Ω = δΘλ = − δe · δA = − (dδx + [dx, ∆h]) · d∆h.
(8.5)
Σ

Σ

Furthermore, we have seen from (3.27) that the difference between different polarizations amounts to the addition of a boundary term and is equivalent to an integration
by parts. Thus, we employ the following trick. First we take λ = 0 in Θλ , so that it
becomes the 2+1D gravity polarization:
ˆ
Θ = − e · δA.
(8.6)
Σ

Then, in the discretization process, we obtain
ˆ
Θ = − dx · d∆h.
Σ

(8.7)

The integrand is an exact 2-form, and thus may be integrated in two equivalent ways:
dx · d∆h = d (x · d∆h) = −d (dx · ∆h) .

(8.8)

Note that the 1-forms x · d∆h and dx · ∆h differ only by a boundary term of the form
d (x · ∆h), and they may be obtained from each other with integration by parts, just as
for the different polarizations. In fact, we may write:
e · δA = dx · d∆h = λd(x · d∆h) − (1 − λ) d(dx · ∆h).
45

(8.9)

We claim that, even though technically both options are equivalent discretizations of
the λ = 0 polarization in (8.1), there is in fact reason to believe that the choice of λ in
(8.1) corresponds to the same choice of λ in (8.9)! We will motivate this by showing
that the choice λ = 0 corresponds to the usual loop gravity polarization, which is
associated with usual general relativity, while the choice λ = 1 corresponds to a dual
polarization which, as we will see, is associated with teleparallel gravity.

8.2

Decomposing the Spatial Manifold

As we have seen, the spatial manifold Σ is decomposed into cells c and disks Dv . The
whole manifold Σ may be recovered by taking the union of the cells with the closures
of the disks (recall that the vertices v are not in Dv , they are on their boundaries):

Given the discretizations (6.43) and (6.36), we replace h, x in (8.9) with hc , xc or h̊v , x̊v
respectively, and then integrate using Stokes’ theorem to obtain:

Θ Dv =

(1 − λ) dx̊v · ∆h̊v − λx̊v · d∆h̊v .

∂Dv

In the next few sections, we will manipulate these expressions so that they can be
integrated once again to obtain truly discrete symplectic potentials.

8.3
8.3.1

The Vertex and Cut Contributions
Calculating the Integral

The boundary ∂Dv splits into three contributions: one from the inner boundary ∂0 Dv
(which is the vertex v), one from the cut Cv , and one from the outer boundary ∂ R Dv .
Thus we have
Θ Dv = −Θ∂0 Dv − ΘCv + Θ∂R Dv ,
(8.15)
46

where the minus sign comes from the fact that orientation of the outer boundary is
opposite to that of the inner boundary. Here we will discuss the first two terms, while
the contribution from the outer boundary ∂ R Dv will be calculated in Section 8.5.
Writing the terms in the integrand explicitly in terms of xv , hv using (6.37), and making
use of the identities
dx̊v = eMv φv (dxv + (Sv + [Mv , xv ]) dφv ) e−Mv φv ,

(8.16)

∆h̊v = eMv φv (δMv φv + ∆hv ) e−Mv φv ,

(8.17)

d∆ h̊v = eMv φv (d∆hv + (δMv + [Mv , ∆hv ]) dφv ) e−Mv φv ,

(8.18)

dx̊v · ∆h̊v = (dxv + (Sv + [Mv , xv ]) dφv ) · (δMv φv + ∆hv ) ,

(8.19)

x̊v · d∆ h̊v = (xv + Sv φv ) · (d∆hv + (δMv + [Mv , ∆hv ]) dφv ) .

(8.20)

we get

The integral on the inner boundary ∂0 Dv is easily calculated, since xv and hv obtain the
constant values xv (v) and hv (v) on the inner boundary. Hence dxv (v) = d∆hv (v) =
0, and these expressions simplify to26
dx̊v · ∆h̊v
x̊v · d∆ h̊v

= (φv Sv · δMv + (Sv + [Mv , xv (v)]) · ∆hv (v)) dφv ,

(8.21)

= (φv Sv · δMv + xv (v) · (δMv + [Mv , ∆hv (v)])) dφv .

(8.22)

∂ 0 Dv

∂ 0 Dv

To evaluate the contribution from the inner boundary, we integrate from φv = αv − 1/2
to φv = αv + 1/2. Then since
ˆ

ˆ

αv +1/2
αv −1/2

dφv = 1,

αv +1/2
αv −1/2

φv dφv = αv ,

(8.23)

we get:
Θ∂0 Dv = (1 − 2λ) αv Sv · δMv + (1 − λ) (Sv + [Mv , xv (v)]) · ∆hv (v) +
− λxv (v) · (δMv + [Mv , ∆hv (v)]) ,
which may be written as
Θ∂0 Dv = (1 − 2λ) αv Sv · δMv + (1 − λ) Sv · ∆hv (v) − λxv (v) · δMv +
+ [Mv , xv (v)] · ∆hv (v) .
Next, we have the cut Cv . Since dφv = 0 on the cut, we have a significant simplification:
dx̊v · ∆h̊v C = dxv · (δMv φv + ∆hv ) ,
(8.24)
v

26 Here

we used the identity [A, B] · C = A · [B, C] to get [Mv , xv ] · δMv = xv · [δMv , Mv ] = 0 and
Sv · [Mv , ∆hv ] = ∆hv · [Sv , Mv ] = 0.

47

x̊v · d∆h̊v

Cv

= (xv + Sv φv ) · d∆hv .

(8.25)

In fact, the cut has two sides: one at φv = αv − 1/2 and another at φv = αv + 1/2,
with opposite orientation. Let us label them Cv− and Cv+ respectively. Any term that
does not depend explicitly on φv will vanish when we take the difference between
both sides of the cut, since they only differ by the value of φv . Thus only the terms
dxv · δMv φv and Sv · d∆hv φv survive. The relevant contribution from each side of the
cut is therefore:

labeled v0 . Taking the difference between both sides of the cut, we thus get the total
contribution:
ΘCv = ΘCv+ − ΘCv−

= (1 − λ) (xv (v0 ) − xv (v)) · δMv − λSv · (∆hv (v0 ) − ∆hv (v)) .
Adding up the contributions from the inner boundary
and the cut, we obtain the ver
tex symplectic potential Θv ≡ − Θ∂0 Dv + ΘCv :
Θv = − (1 − 2λ) αv Sv · δMv − Sv · (∆hv (v) − λ∆hv (v0 )) +
+ (xv (v) − (1 − λ) xv (v0 )) · δMv − [Mv , xv (v)] · ∆hv (v) .

The “Particle” Potential

8.4.1

Simplifying the Potential
k

Let xv (v0 ) be the component of xv (v0 ) parallel to Sv :
k

k

x v ( v0 ) ≡ x v ( v0 ) + x ⊥
v ( v0 ) ,

x v ( v0 ) ≡ ( x v ( v0 ) · J0 ) P0 ,

(8.28)

where J0 and P0 are the Cartan generator of rotations and translations respectively,
and we remind the reader that the dot product is defined in (2.11) as Ji · P j = δij and
Ji · J j = Pi · P j = 0. Similarly, let ∆k hv (v0 ) be the component of ∆hv (v0 ) parallel to
Mv :
∆hv (v0 ) ≡ ∆k hv (v0 ) + ∆⊥ hv (v0 ) ,

∆k hv (v0 ) ≡ (∆hv (v0 ) · P0 ) J0 .
48

(8.29)

Let us now define a g-valued 0-form ∆Hv , which is a 1-form on field space (i.e. a
variation27 ):
∆Hv ≡ ∆hv (v) − λ∆k hv (v0 ) ,
(8.30)
and a g∗ -valued 0-form Xv called the vertex flux:
k

Xv ≡ xv (v) − (1 − λ) xv (v0 ) − (1 − 2λ) αv Sv .

(8.31)

Then since Sv · ∆hv (v0 ) = Sv · ∆k hv (v0 ) we have
Sv · (∆hv (v) − λ∆hv (v0 )) = Sv · ∆Hv ,

(8.32)

k

and since xv (v0 ) · δMv = xv (v0 ) · δMv we have
(8.33)
(xv (v) − (1 − λ) xv (v0 ) − (1 − 2λ) αv Sv ) · δMv = Xv · δMv .
h
i
k
Furthermore, since Mv , xv (v0 ) = [Mv , Sv ] = 0 and [Mv , Xv ] · ∆k hv (v0 ) = 0 we have

[Mv , xv (v)] · ∆hv (v) = [Mv , Xv ] · ∆Hv .

(8.34)

Therefore (8.26) becomes
Θv = Xv · δMv − (Sv + [Mv , Xv ]) · ∆Hv .

(8.35)

This potential resembles that of a point particle with mass Mv and spin Sv . Note that
the free parameter λ has been absorbed into Xv and ∆Hv , so this potential is obtained
independently of the value of λ and thus the choice of polarization!
8.4.2

Properties of the Potential

Omitting the subscript v for brevity, we will now study the relativistic particle symplectic potential
Θ ≡ X · δM − (S + [M, X]) · ∆H,
(8.36)
with the symplectic form
1
(S + [M, X]) · [∆H, ∆H ] .
2
(8.37)
We define the momentum p and angular momentum j of the particle:
Ω ≡ δΘ = δX · δM − (δS + [δM, X] + [M, δX]) · ∆H −

p ≡ H −1 MH ∈ g∗ ,

j ≡ H −1 (S + [M, X]) H ∈ g,

(8.38)

the suggestive notation, in principle ∆Hv need not be of the form δHv Hv−1 for some Gvalued 0-form Hv . It can instead be of the form δhv for some g-valued 0-form hv . Its precise form is left
implicit, and we merely assume that there is a solution for either Hv or hv in terms of hv (v) and hv (v0 ).
27 Despite

49

which have the variational differentials
δp = H −1 (δM + [M, ∆H ]) H,

(8.39)

δj = H −1 (δS + [δM, X] + [M, δX] + [S + [M, X] , ∆H ]) H.

(8.40)

We also define the “position”
q ≡ H −1 XH ∈ g,

(8.41)

in terms of which the symplectic potential may be written as
Θ = q · δp − S · ∆H.
8.4.3

(8.42)

Right Translations (Gauge Transformations)

Let

H ≡ (X, H ) = eX H ∈ G n g∗ ,

G ≡ ( g, z) ∈ G n g∗

=⇒

HG = eX+ HzH

−1

Hg.
(8.43)
This is a right translation, with parameter G , of the group element H, which corresponds to a gauge transformation:
H 7→ Hg,

X 7→ X + HzH −1 ,

M 7→ M,

S 7→ S.

(8.44)

It is interesting to translate this action onto the physical variables (p, q, j) which transform as
p → g−1 pg,
q → z + g−1 qg,
j → g−1 jg.
(8.45)
This shows that the parameter g labels a rotation of the physical variables, while z
labels a translation of the physical position q. Taking g ≡ eg , we may consider transformations labeled by g + z ∈ g ⊕ g∗ with z ∈ g∗ a translation parameter and g ∈ g a
rotation parameter, given by the infinitesimal version of the gauge transformation28 :

Lg,z h = hg,

Lg,z X = gxg−1 ,

Lg,z M = 0,

Lg,z S = 0.

(8.46)

Let I denote the interior product on field space, associated with the variational exterior
derivative δ, as explained in Section 2.5. Then one finds that this transformation is
Hamiltonian:
Ig,z Ω = −δHg,z ,
Hg,z ≡ − (p · z + j · g) .
(8.47)
The Poisson bracket between two such Hamiltonians is given by

Hg,z , Hg0 ,z0 = Lg,z Hg0 ,z0 = H([g,z0 ]+[z,g0 ],[g,g0 ]) ,

(8.48)

which reproduces, as expected, the symmetry algebra g ⊕ g∗ .
28 The

transformations will be given by the action of the Lie derivative La ≡ Ia δ + δIa where Ia is the
variational interior product with respect to a. In the literature the notation δa is often used instead, but
we avoid it in order to prevent confusion with the variational exterior derivative δ.

50

8.4.4

Left Translations (Symmetry Transformations)

Similarly, let

H ≡ (h, X) ∈ G n g∗ ,

G ≡ ( g, z) ∈ G n g∗

=⇒

GH = ez+ gXg

−1

gh.

(8.49)

This is a left translation, with parameter G , of the group element H, which corresponds
to a symmetry that leaves the connection invariant:
h 7→ gh,

X 7→ z + gXg−1 ,

M 7→ gMg−1 ,

S 7→ g (S + [z, M]) g−1 . (8.50)

Note that it commutes with the right translation. The infinitesimal transformation,
with g ≡ eg and g + z ∈ g ⊕ g∗ as above, is

Lg,z h = gh,

Lg,z X = z + [g, X] ,

Lg,z S = [g, S] + [z, M] .
(8.51)
Once again, we can prove that this transformation is Hamiltonian:
Ig,z Ω = −δHg,z ,

Lg,z M = [g, M] ,

Hg,z ≡ − (M · z + S · g) .

(8.52)

This follows from the fact that

Lg,z (S + [M, X]) = [g, S + [M, X]] ,

(8.53)

which implies that these transformations leave the momentum and angular momentum invariant: Lg,z p = 0 = Lg,z j.
8.4.5

Restriction to the Cartan Subalgebra

In the case discussed here, where M ∈ h∗ and S ∈ h are in the Cartan subalgebra,
we need to restrict the parameter of the left translation transformation to be in h ⊕ h∗ .
A particular class of transformations of this type is when the parameter is itself a
function of M and S, which we shall denote F (M, S). One finds that the infinitesimal

is Hamiltonian:

IδF Ω = −δHF ,

HF ≡ − F (M, S) .

(8.55)

In particular, taking

ξ, χ ∈ R,

(8.56)

we obtain the Hamiltonian transformation
δF h = Mχh,

S 7→ S.

The Hamiltonians M2 and M · S represent the Casimir invariants of the algebra g ⊕ g∗ .

and Θv is given by (8.35).
In order to simplify Θ∂R Dv , we recall from Section 6.1 that the boundary ∂c of the cell c
is composed of edges (cci ) and arcs (cvi ) such that
∂c =

Nc

((cci ) ∪ (cvi )) ,

where Nv is the number of cells around v. This is illustrated in Figure 5.

Importantly, in terms of orientation, (cc0 ) = (c0 c) and (cv) = (vc)−1 . We thus see
that each edge (cc0 ) is integrated over exactly twice, once from the integral over ∂c and
once from the integral over ∂c0 with opposite orientation, and similarly each arc (cv)
is integrated over twice, once from ∂c and once from ∂ R Dv with opposite orientation.
Hence we may rearrange the sums and integrals as follows:

Holonomies and Fluxes

Let us label the source and target points of the edge (cc0 ) as σcc0 and τcc0 respectively,
and the source and target points of the arc (vc) as σvc and τvc respectively, where σ
stands for “source” and τ for “target”:

cc0 ≡ (σcc0 τcc0 ) ,
(8.74)

8.6.1

Holonomies on the Links and Segments

The rotational holonomy hcc0 comes from the continuity relations (8.68). Its role is
relating the variables hc , xc on the cell c to the variables hc0 , xc0 on the cell c0 . Now, in
the relation hc ( x ) = hcc0 hc0 ( x ), the holonomy on the left-hand side is from the node c∗
to a point x on the edge (cc0 ). Therefore, the holonomy on the right-hand side should
also take us from c∗ to x. Since hc0 ( x ) is the holonomy from c0∗ to x, we see that hcc0
must take us from c∗ to c0∗ . In other words, the holonomy hcc0 is exactly the holonomy
∗
from c∗ to c0∗ , along29 the link (cc0 ) , which was discussed in Section 2.7.
∗
Thus we define30 holonomies along the links (cc0 ) :
Hcc0 ≡ hcc0 ,

0

∆Hcc ≡ δHcc0 Hc0 c .

(8.75)

the geometry is flat, the actual path taken does not matter, only that it starts at c∗ and ends at
We may therefore assume without loss of generality that the path taken by hcc0 is, in fact, along the
∗
link (cc0 ) .
30 The change from lower-case h to upper-case H is only symbolic here, but it will become more
meaningful when we define other holonomies and fluxes below.
29 Since

54

Similarly, the holonomy hvc comes from the continuity relations (8.69), and it takes us
from the vertex v to the node c∗ . We define (vc)∗ to be the line segment connecting v
to c∗ ; it is dual to the arc (vc) and its inverse is (cv)∗ . We then define holonomies along
the segments (vc)∗ :
Hvc ≡ hvc ,
∆Hvc ≡ δHvc Hcv .

Fluxes on the Edges and Arcs

From the integral in the first term of (8.72), we are inspired to define fluxes along the
edges (cc0 ):
ˆ
c0
dxc = xc (τcc0 ) − xc (σcc0 ) .
X̃c ≡
(8.78)
(cc0 )

∗

0

The tilde specifies that the flux X̃cc is on the edge (cc0 ) dual to the link (cc0 ) ; the flux
0
Xcc , to be defined below, is on the link, and similarly we will define H̃cc0 to be the
holonomy on the edge, while Hcc0 is the holonomy on the link.
0

The flux X̃cc is a composition of two translational holonomies. The holonomy −xc (σcc0 )
takes us from the point σcc0 to the node c∗ , and then the holonomy xc (τcc0 ) takes us
from c∗ to τcc0 . Hence, the composition of these holonomies is a translational holonomy from σcc0 to τcc0 , that is, along31 the edge (cc0 ), as claimed.
−1

To find the inverse flux we use (cc0 ) = (c0 c) , σcc0 = τc0 c and (8.68):
ˆ
0
c
X̃c0 ≡
dxc0 = xc0 (τc0 c ) − xc0 (σc0 c ) = hc0 c (xc (σcc0 ) − xc (τcc0 )) hcc0 = − Hc0 c X̃cc Hcc0 .
(c0 c)

(8.79)
Similarly, from the first integral in (8.73) we are inspired to define fluxes along the arcs
(vc):
ˆ
X̃cv ≡

dx̊v = x̊v (τvc ) − x̊v (σvc ) .

(8.80)

(vc)

Note that this time, the two translational holonomies are composed at v. As for the
inverse, we define X̃vc as follows and use (8.69) to find a relation with X̃cv , taking into
account the fact that (cv) = (vc)−1 and σcv = τvc :
ˆ
v
X̃c ≡
dxc = xc (τcv ) − xc (σcv ) = hcv (x̊v (σvc ) − x̊v (τvc )) hvc = − Hcv X̃cv Hvc .

In conclusion, we have the relations

X̃cc0 = − Hc0 c X̃cc Hcc0 ,

X̃vc = − Hcv X̃cv Hvc .

8.6.3

Holonomies on the Edges and Arcs

The holonomies and fluxes defined thus far will be used in the λ = 0 polarization.
In the λ = 1 (dual) polarization, let us define holonomies along the edges (cc0 ) and
holonomies along the arcs (vc):
1
H̃cc0 ≡ h−
c ( σcc0 ) hc ( τcc0 ) ,
1
H̃vc ≡ h̊−
v ( σvc ) h̊v ( τvc ) ,

0

∆ H̃cc ≡ δ H̃cc0 H̃c0 c ,

(8.83)

∆ H̃vc ≡ δ H̃vc H̃cv .

(8.84)

c0

1
As with X̃c , the holonomy H̃cc0 starts from σcc0 , goes to c∗ via h−
c ( σcc0 ), and then goes
to τcc0 via hc (τcc0 ). Therefore it is indeed a holonomy along the edge (cc0 ). Similarly,
1
the holonomy H̃vc starts from σvc , goes to v via h̊−
v ( σvc ), and then goes to τvc via
h̊v (τvc ). Therefore it is indeed a holonomy along the arc (vc).
0

The difference compared to X̃cc is that in H̃cc0 we have rotational instead of translational holonomies, and the composition of holonomies is (non-abelian) multiplication
instead of addition. As before, the tilde specifies that the holonomy is on the edges or
arcs and not the dual links or segments.
The variations of these holonomies are:

(8.86)
Thus, we see that they relate to the integrals in the second terms of (8.72) and (8.73).

Since (cc0 ) = (c0 c) , it is obvious that H̃cc
0 = H̃c0 c . Furthermore, by combining (8.84)
with (8.69) we may obtain an expression for H̃vc in terms of hc :

If we now define

H̃vc = h−
c ( σvc ) hc ( τvc ) .

(8.87)

1
H̃cv ≡ h−
c ( σcv ) hc ( τcv ) ,

(8.88)

then using the relations σcv = τvc and τcv = σvc , which come from the fact that (vc) =

Fluxes on the Links and Segments

Just as we defined the holonomies on the links and segments from the variables hcc0
and hvc , which were used in the continuity relations (8.68) and (8.69), we can similarly
56

0

define the fluxes on the links and segments from the variables xcc and xcv . These will,
again, be used in the dual polarization.

Let us define fluxes along the links (cc0 ) and segments (vc)∗ :

Xcc ≡ h−

(8.90)

The factors of hc (σcc0 ) and h̊v (σvc ) are needed because they appear alongside the integrals in the variations (8.85) and (8.86). Thus, if we want the second terms in (8.72)
and (8.73) to look like we want them to, we must include these extra factors in the definition of the fluxes. The fluxes are still translational holonomies between two cells (in
0
the case of xcc ) or a cell and a disk (in the case of xcv ), but they contain an extra rotation
at the starting point.
The inverse link flux Xcc0 follows from (8.68), (8.70) and σcc0 = τc0 c , while the inverse

The Discretized Symplectic Potential

0

0

0

Θcc0 = (1 − λ) X̃cc · ∆Hcc − λXcc · ∆ H̃cc ,

Notice how the holonomies and fluxes are always dual to each other: one with tilde
(on the edges/arcs) and one without tilde (on the links/segments). For the λ = 0
∗
polarization, the holonomies are on the links (cc0 ) and segments (vc)∗ and the fluxes
are on their dual edges (cc0 ) and arcs (vc). This polarization corresponds to the usual
loop gravity picture. For the λ = 1 (dual) polarization, we have the opposite case: the
∗
fluxes are on the links (cc0 ) and segments (vc)∗ and the holonomies are on their dual
edges (cc0 ) and arcs (vc). For any other choice of λ, we have a combination of both
polarizations.
The phase space corresponding to X · ∆H for some flux X and holonomy H is called
the holonomy-flux phase space, and it is the classical phase space of the spin networks
which appear in loop quantum gravity.

The Gauss and Curvature Constraints

We have seen that, in the continuum, the constraints are F = T = 0. Let us see how
they translate to constraints on the discrete phase space. There will be two types of
constraints: the curvature constraints which corresponds to F = 0, and the Gauss constraints which correspond to T = 0. The constraints will be localized in three different
types of places: on the cells, on the disks, and on the faces. After deriving all of the
constraints and showing that they are identically satisfied in our construction, we will
summarize and interpret them. The reader who is not interested in the details of the
calculation may wish to skip to Section 9.4.

(9.3)

v3c (cv)

where c0 3 c means “all cells c0 adjacent to c” and v 3 c means “all vertices v adjacent
to c”.
Using the fluxes defined in (8.78) and (8.81), we get
Gc =

This constraint is satisfied identically in our construction. Indeed, from (8.78) and
(8.81) we have
0

X̃cc = xc (τcc0 ) − xc (σcc0 ) ,

X̃vc = xc (τcv ) − xc (σcv ) .

(9.5)

Since τcci = σcvi and τcvi = σcci+1 (the end of an edge is the beginning of an arc and the
end of an arc is the beginning of an edge), and τcv Nc = σcc1 (the end of the last arc is the
0
beginning of the first edge), it is easy to see that the sum ∑c0 3c X̃cc + ∑v3c X̃vc evaluates
to zero.

Derivation of the Constraints on the Disks

Since we have placed the curvature and torsion excitations inside the disks, the constraints on the disks must involve these excitations – namely, Mv and Sv . We will now
see that this is indeed the case.
9.2.1

The Gauss Constraint on the Disks

The disk Gauss constraint Gv will impose the torsionlessness condition T ≡ dA e = 0
inside the punctured32 disks:

dx̊v = ∑
dx̊v = ∑ X̃cv .

∂ R Dv

On the cut Cv , we have contributions from both sides, one at φv = αv − 12 and another
at φv = αv + 21 with opposite orientation. Since dφv = 0 on the cut, we have:

32 As

we have seen, we only have T = 0 inside the punctured disk Dv ; at the vertex v itself there is
torsion, but v is not part of Dv . Instead, it is on its (inner) boundary. As can be seen from Figure 2, the
path we take here, as given by (9.14), does not enclose the vertex, and therefore the interior of the path
is indeed torsionless.

60

since xv has the value xv (v0 ) at r = R and xv (v) at r = 0 on the cut.
Adding up the integrals, we find that the Gauss constraint on the disk is


1
1
Gv = ∑ X̃cv − Sv − eMv (αv − 2 ) eMv xv (v0 ) e−Mv −xv (v0 ) e−Mv (αv − 2 ) = 0.

(9.18)

c∈v

In fact, since this constraint is used as a generator of symmetries (as we will see below),
it automatically comes dotted with a Cartan element βv , which commutes with eMv .
Therefore, the last term may be ignored, and the constraint simplifies to
!
βv · Gv = βv ·
Thus it may also be written

∑ X̃cv − Sv

= 0.

(9.19)

c∈v

∑ X̃cv = Sv .

(9.20)

c∈v

To see that this constraint is satisfied identically in our construction, let us combine
(8.80) with (6.37) to obtain
X̃cv = Sv (τvc − σvc ) + eMv τvc xv (τvc ) e−Mv τvc − eMv σvc xv (σvc ) e−Mv σvc ,

(9.21)

where we used a slight abuse of notation by using σvc and τvc to denote the corresponding angles, σvc ≡ φv (σvc ) and τvc ≡ φv (τvc ). Let us now sum over the
fluxes for each arc. Since τvci = σvci+1 (each arc ends where the next one starts) and
τvc Nv = σvc1 + 1 (the last arc ends a full circle after the first arc began33 ), we get

Choosing without loss of generality the point v0 to be at the beginning of the first
edge, v0 = σvc1 , and recalling that this point corresponds to the angle φv = αv − 21 , we
indeed obtain precisely the constraint (9.18).
9.2.2

The Curvature Constraint on the Disks

The disk curvature constraint Fv will impose that F ≡ dA + 12 [A, A] = 0 inside the

Let us describe the path of integration step by step, referring to Figure 2:
33 Recall

that we are using scaled angles such that a full circle corresponds to 1 instead of 2π!
we only have F = 0 inside the punctured disk Dv ; at the vertex v itself, there is curvature.
However, the path of integration does not enclose the vertex, and therefore the interior of the path is
indeed flat.
34 Again,

61

• We start at v, at the polar coordinates rv = 0 and φv = αv − 1/2.
• We take the path Cv− along the cut at φv = αv − 1/2 from rv = 0 to rv = R.
• We go around the outer boundary ∂ R Dv of the disk at rv = R from φv = αv − 1/2
to φv = αv + 1/2.
• We take the path Cv+ along the cut at φv = αv + 1/2 from rv = R to rv = 0.
• Finally, we go around the inner boundary ∂0 Dv of the disk at rv = 0 from φv =
αv + 1/2 to φv = αv − 1/2, back to our starting point.
Let us evaluate each term individually. On Cv− and Cv+ we have35 from (7.15):

that the angle φv ( x ) in the term eMv φv ( x) in (7.15) refers to the difference in angles between the
starting point and the final point, therefore it vanishes in this case since the path along the cut is purely
radial.

62

This may be written more suggestively as

∏ H̃vc = h−v 1 (v0 ) eMv hv (v0 ) .

Let us now show that this constraint is satisfied identically in our construction. From
(8.84) we have

and using the definition h̊v ≡ eMv φv hv from (6.37) we get

H̃vc = h−
hv (τvc ) .

Now, consider the product

This is a telescoping product; the term hv (τvci ) always cancels the term h−

∏ eMv (φv (τvci )−φv (σvci )) = eMv ,

(9.34)

where we used the fact that the angles sum to 1, and hv τvc Nv = hv (σvc1 ). In conclusion:
(9.35)
∏ H̃vc = h−v 1 (σvc1 ) eMv hv (σvc1 ) .
c∈v

If we then choose, without loss of generality, the point v0 (which defines the cut Cv ) to
be at σvc1 (where c1 is an arbitrarily chosen cell), we get

∏ H̃vc = h−v 1 (v0 ) eMv hv (v0 ) ,

(9.36)

c∈v

and we see that the constraint is indeed identically satisfied.

9.3

Derivation of the Constraints on the Faces

We have seen that the Gauss constraints, as we have defined them, involve the fluxes
on the edges and arcs. Since these fluxes are not part of the phase space for λ = 1,
these constraints cannot be imposed in that case. Similarly, the curvature constraints
involve the holonomies on the edges and arcs and therefore will not work for the case
λ = 0. This is a result of formulating both constraints on the cells and disks, which
then requires us to use the holonomies and fluxes on the edges and arcs which are on
their boundaries.
63

Alternatively, instead of demanding that the torsion and curvature vanish on the cells
and disks, we may demand that they vanish on the faces v∗ created by the spin network links. Since the (closures of the) faces cover the entire spatial manifold Σ, this is
entirely equivalent.
This alternative form is obtained by deforming (or expanding) the disks such that they
coincide with the faces. The inner boundary ∂0 Dv → ∂0 v∗ is still the vertex v. The
outer boundary ∂ R Dv → ∂ R v∗ now consists of links (ci ci+1 )∗ , where i ∈ {1, . . . , Nv }
and c Nv +1 ≡ c1 . The point v0 on the outer boundary can now be identified, without
loss of generality, with the node c1∗ . Thus, the cut Cv → Cv∗ now extends from v to c1∗ .
Since the spatial manifold Σ is now composed solely of the union of the closures of the
faces, and not cells and disks, we only need one type of Gauss constraint and one type
of curvature constraint. Let us derive them now.

36 Note

(9.42)

that (8.69) is only valid on the arc (vc), which is the boundary between c and Dv . However,
since we have expanded the disks, the arcs now coincide with the links, with every arc (vc) intersecting
the two links connected to the node c∗ . Thus the equation is still valid at c∗ itself.

group elements and rewrite the constraint as follows:
!
Nv

∏ h c i c i +1

Fv∗ ≡

hc1 v e−Mv hvc1 = 1.

(9.68)

Switching to the notation of (8.75) and (8.76), we rewrite this as

Nv

Fv∗ ≡

∏ Hci ci+1

Hc1 v e−Mv Hvc1 = 1.

(9.69)

An even nicer form of this constraint is
Nv

∏ Hci ci+1 = Hc1 v eMv Hvc1 .

(9.70)

i =1

In other words, the loop of holonomies on the left-hand side would be the identity if
there is no curvature, that is, Mv = 0.
To show that this constraint is satisfied identically, we use (7.16) with x = c∗ and
y = c0∗ :

38 One

might wonder about the appearance of hv (v0 ) in (9.78) and (9.80), since the true phase space
variable is Hv , defined implicitly in (8.30) as a function of hv (v) and hv (v0 ). It is possible that there
is an expression for these two constraints in terms of Hv instead of hv (v0 ), but since we only have an
implicit definition for Hv in terms of its variation ∆Hv , it is unclear how to obtain it. For now, we
simply assume that both Hv and hv (v0 ) are phase space variables. See also footnote 27.

The Gauss constraint on the cell c can also be written as
X̃cc
∑
0

0

c 3c

= − ∑ X̃vc .

(9.82)

v3c

It tells us that the sum of fluxes along the edges and arcs surrounding c is zero, as
expected given that the interior of c is flat. Alternatively, we may say that the sum
of fluxes along the edges is prevented from summing to zero by the presence of the
fluxes on the arcs.
The Gauss constraint on the punctured disk Dv can also be written as

∑ X̃cv = Sv .

(9.83)

c∈v

It tells us that the sum of fluxes on the arcs of the disk is prevented from summing to
zero due to the torsion at the vertex v, as encoded in the parameter Sv . Note that if
Sv = 0, that is, there is no torsion at v, then the constraint becomes simply ∑c∈v X̃cv = 0.
Importantly, notice that the sum ∑v3c X̃vc on the right-hand side of (9.82) is over all the
fluxes on the arcs surrounding a particular cell c, while the sum ∑c∈v X̃cv on the lefthand side of (9.83) is over all the fluxes on the arcs surrounding a particular disk Dv .
While the sums look alike at first sight, they are completely different and one cannot
be exchanged for the other.
The Gauss constraint on the face v∗ can also be written as
Nv

∑ Xcii+1 = h−v 1 (v0 ) Sv hv (v0 ) .
c

(9.84)

i =1

It tells us that the sum of fluxes on the link forming the boundary of the face is prevented from summing to zero due to the torsion at the vertex v, as encoded in the
parameter Sv .
The curvature constraint on the cell c is
Nc

∏ H̃cci H̃cvi = 1.

(9.85)

i =1

It is analogous to the cell Gauss constraint, and imposes that the product of holonomies
along the boundary of the cell is the identity.
The curvature constraint on the punctured disk Dv can also be written as

∏ H̃vc = h−v 1 (v0 ) eMv hv (v0 ) .

(9.86)

c∈v

On the left-hand side, we have a loop of holonomies around the vertex v. If Mv = 0,
that is, there is no curvature at v, then the right-hand side becomes the identity, as
we would expect. Otherwise, it is a quantity which depends on the curvature. The
70

curvature constraint on the disks is thus analogous to the Gauss constraint on the
disks, with torsion replaced by curvature.
Finally, the curvature constraint on the face v∗ can also be written as
Nv

∏ Hci ci+1 = Hc1 v eMv Hvc1 .

(9.87)

i =1

It has the same meaning as the one on the disks, except that the loop of holonomies
around the vertex v is now composed of links instead of arcs.

The Constraints as Generators of Symmetries

Now that we have obtained the Gauss and curvature constraints on the cells, disks,
and faces, we would like to derive the symmetries that they generate. Recall again39
that, given a symplectic form Ω, the Hamiltonian vector field of f is the vector field H f
satisfying
IH f Ω = −δ f .
(10.1)
This can be interpreted as the variational interior product IH f producing a transformation on the phase space represented by Ω, which is generated by the constraint f .
We will now show that the Gauss constraint generates rotations, and the curvature
constraint generates translations. In other words, we will find transformations, given
by the Lie derivative La ≡ Ia δ + δIa for some Hamiltonian vector field corresponding
to a transformation with some parameter a (using a slight abuse of notation), that are
of the schematic form
Iβ Ω ∝ − β · δG,

Iz Ω ∝ −z · ∆Fc ,

(10.2)

where β is a rotation parameter and z is a translation parameter. As before, the reader
who is not interested in the calculation itself may skip directly to the results in Section
10.4.

X̃cv · ∆Hvc = − Hvc X̃vc Hcv · (δHvc Hcv ) = X̃vc · ∆Hcv .

that:

Iβv Ω ∝ − βv · δGv ,
(10.4)
Izc Ω ∝ −zc · ∆Fc ,

Izv Ω ∝ −zv · ∆Fv .

(10.5)

We will see that the proportionality coefficients will be λ-dependent.

10.2

The Gauss Constraints as Generators of Rotations

10.2.1

The Gauss Constraint on the Cells

Let us consider the rotation transformation with parameter βc defined by40

L βc Hcc0 = βc Hcc0 ,
0

0

L βc X̃cc = [ βc , X̃cc ],

L βc Hcv = βc Hcv ,

(10.6)

L βc X̃vc = [ βc , X̃vc ],

(10.7)

such that any other variables are unaffected; this includes variables unrelated to the
0
particular c of choice, as well as the dual variables H̃cc0 , H̃cv , Xcc , and Xvc .
40 As we explained in Footnote 28,

in the literature the notation δa is often used for the transformation
with respect to the parameter a, but we avoid it in order to prevent confusion with the variational
exterior derivative δ. The transformation is indeed given by the action of the Lie derivative La ≡
Ia δ + δIa , as indicated here.

Applying it to Ω and using the identity Iβc ∆Hcc = Iβc ∆Hcv = βc , we get:

Hence this transformation is generated by the cell Gauss constraint Gc , given by (9.76),
as long as λ 6= 1.
10.2.2

The Gauss Constraint on the Disks

Next we consider the rotation transformation with parameter βv defined by

L βv X̃cv = [ βv , X̃cv ],

L βv Hvc = βv Hvc ,
L βv Hv = (1 − λ) βv Hv ,

L β v X v = (1 − λ ) [ β v , X v ],

(10.8)
(10.9)

such that any other variables are unaffected; this includes variables unrelated to the
particular v of choice, as well as the dual variables H̃vc and Xcv . Importantly, we choose
the 0-form βv to be valued in the Cartan subalgebra, so it commutes with Mv and Sv .
Applying the transformation to Ω and using the identities Iβv ∆Hvc = βv and Iβv ∆Hv =
(1 − λ) βv , we get:

Iβv Ω = (1 − λ) ∑ [ βv , X̃cv ] · ∆Hvc − δX̃cv · βv + X̃cv · [ βv , ∆Hvc ] +
c∈v

+ (1 − λ) ([ βv , Xv ] · δMv − [Mv , [ βv , Xv ]] · ∆Hv ) +
+ (1 − λ) ((δSv + [δMv , Xv ] + [Mv , δXv ]) · βv − (Sv + [Mv , Xv ]) · [ βv , ∆Hv ]) .
Isolating βv and using the fact that it commutes with Mv and Sv , we see that most
terms cancel41 , and we get:
!
I β v Ω = − (1 − λ ) β v ·

∑ δX̃cv − δSv

c∈v

= − (1 − λ ) β v · G v .

(10.11)

Hence this transformation is generated by the disk Gauss constraint Gv , given by
(9.77), as long as λ 6= 1.
41 In

this calculation, we make use of the Jacobi identity:

[ βv , [Mv , Xv ]] + [Mv , [Xv , βv ]] = − [Xv , [ βv , Mv ]] = 0.

(10.10)

10.2.3

The Gauss Constraint on the Faces

Lastly, we consider the rotation transformation with parameter βv∗ defined by
0

0

L βv∗ Xcc = −[ βv∗ , Xcc ],

L βv∗ H̃cc0 = − βv∗ H̃cc0 ,
L βv∗ Hv = λ β̄v∗ Hv ,

(10.12)

L βv∗ Xv = λ[ β̄v∗ , Xv ],

(10.13)

such that any other variables are unaffected, including variables unrelated to the par0
ticular v of choice as well as the dual variables Hcc0 and X̃cc , and such that
1
β v∗ ≡ h −
v ( v0 ) β̄v∗ hv ( v0 ) ,

(10.14)

where β̄v∗ is valued in the Cartan subalgebra. Applying the transformation to Ω, we
get after a calculation analogous to the one we did for the disks,

(10.16)

Thus, in conclusion,

Iβv∗ Ω = −λβv∗ · δGv∗ ,

(10.17)

and this transformation is generated by the face Gauss constraint Gv , given by (9.78),
as long as λ 6= 0.

10.3

The Curvature Constraints as Generators of Translations

10.3.1

The Curvature Constraint on the Cells

For the curvature constraint on the cells, we would like to find a translation transformation with parameter zc such that
Izc Ω = −zc · ∆Fc .
74

(10.18)

First, we should calculate ∆Fc . Recall that
Nc

Fc ≡

∏ H̃cci H̃cvi = 1.

(10.19)

i =1

To simplify the calculation, let us define Ki ≡ H̃cci H̃cvi such that we may write
N

Fc =

∏ K i = K1 · · · K N ,

(10.20)

i =1

where we omit the subscript c on Nc for brevity. Then
δFc = δK1 K2 · · · K N + K1 δK2 K3 · · · K N + · · · +

where ∆Ki ≡ δKi Ki−1 . Hence
∆Fc ≡ δFc Fc−1

+ (K1 · · · K N −2 ) ∆K N −1 (K1 · · · K N −2 )−1 +

N

≡

∑ (K1 · · · Ki−1 ) ∆Ki (K1 · · · Ki−1 )−1 ,

i =1

where K1 · · · Ki−1 ≡ 1 for i = 1. For conciseness, we may define χi such that χ1 ≡ 1
and, for i > 1,
χi ≡ K1 · · · Ki−1 = H̃cc1 H̃cv1 · · · H̃cci−1 H̃cvi−1 ,
(10.21)
and write
∆Fc =

N

∑ χi ∆Ki χi−1.

(10.22)

i =1

Plugging in Ki ≡ H̃cci H̃cvi back, and using the identity
c

v

∆Ki = ∆ H̃c i + H̃cci ∆ H̃c i H̃ci c

(10.23)

we get
∆Fc =

c
Izc Ω = −λ ∑ Lzc Xci · ∆ H̃c i + Lzc Xc i · ∆ H̃c i .

Comparing with (10.24), we see that if we take

Lzc Xvc i = H̃ci c χi−1 zc χi H̃cci ,

Lzc Xcci = χi−1 zc χi ,
we will obtain

Izc Ω = −λzc · ∆Fc ,

(10.26)
(10.27)

as required. Hence this transformation is generated by the cell curvature constraint Fc ,
given by (9.79), as long as λ 6= 0.
10.3.2

The Curvature Constraint on the Disks

As in the cell case, we would like to find a translation transformation with parameter
zv such that
Izv Ω = −zv · ∆Fv ,
(10.28)
where

where z̄v is a 0-form valued in the Cartan subalgebra, and calculate zv · ∆Fv . We find
that, since [z̄v , Mv ] = 0, the terms ∆hv (v0 ) − eMv ∆hv (v0 ) e−Mv cancel out and we are

Conclusions

We have found that the Gauss constraints Gc , Gv , Gv∗ and curvature constraints Fc , Fv ,
Fv∗ for each cell c, disk Dv and face v∗ , given by (9.76), (9.77), (9.78), (9.79), (9.80) and
(9.81), generate transformations with rotation parameters βc , βv , βv∗ and translations
parameters zc , zv , zv∗ as follows:
Iβc Ω = − (1 − λ) βc · δGc ,
Izc Ω = −λzc · ∆Fc ,

Iβv Ω = − (1 − λ) βv · δGv ,

Izv Ω = −λzv · ∆Fv ,

Iβv∗ Ω = −λβv∗ · δGv∗ ,
(10.55)
Izv∗ Ω = − (1 − λ) zv∗ · ∆Fv∗ . (10.56)

where βc is a g∗ -valued 0-form.
The Gauss constraint on the disk Dv generates rotations of the holonomies on the

(10.64)

that the curvature constraints do not transform any holonomies, since the holonomies are

χi ≡ Hc1 c2 · · · Hci−1 ci ,

(10.68)

and zv∗ is a 0-form valued in the Cartan subalgebra h of g.
Importantly, in the case λ = 0, the usual loop gravity polarization, the curvature
constraints on the cells and disks do not generate any transformations since Izc Ω =
Izv Ω = 0. Similarly, for the case λ = 1, the dual polarization, the Gauss constraints
on the cells and disks do not generate any transformations since Iβc Ω = Iβv Ω = 0. Of
course, the reason for this is that, as we noted earlier, these constraints are formulated
in the first place in terms of holonomies and fluxes which only exist in a particular
polarization. Thus for λ = 0 we must instead use the curvature constraint on the
faces, and for λ = 1 we must instead use the Gauss constraint on the faces.
In the hybrid polarization with λ = 1/2, all of the discrete variables exist: there are
holonomies and fluxes on both the links/edges and the arcs/segments. Therefore, in
this polarization all 6 types of constraints may be consistently formulated using the
available variables, and all of them generate transformations.
Note that, if λ = 0 or λ = 1, those transformations for which Ia Ω = 0 for some
parameter a are gauge symmetries; they are in the kernel of the symplectic form, and
should therefore be divided out. The transformations for which Ia Ω 6= 0 are also
symmetries, but not gauge symmetries.

11.1

Shrinking the Disks: Focusing on the Corners
Introduction

In the Chapter 8 we rigorously calculated the discrete symplectic potential by using
disks to regularize the singularities at the punctures. In this chapter, we will take a
different approach. Instead of disks, we will just have points; this may be understood
80

as the limit where the radius of the disks goes to zero, R → 0, in the derivation above.
In other words, we shrink the disks to points.
Not only will this calculation be shorter – since we will only have the edge terms and
nothing more – and much more elegant, we will also be able to precisely illustrate
the role of corner modes in our derivation. The premise here is that the edge modes
actually cancel between the cells; this is why we don’t get any contributions from the
edges themselves. They cancel simply because the contribution from one cell exactly
cancels the contribution from the other cell.
In a flat and torsionless geometry, the corners of the cells – that is, the vertices – will
also cancel; the contributions from each of the cells surrounding a vertex will add up
to zero simply because this is a sum of holonomies going in a loop around the vertex,
and if there is no curvature or torsion, the sum of holonomies is zero, as we would
expect. However, if we introduce curvature and/or torsion, the sum of holonomies
now probes these curvature and torsion, and the contributions will no longer add up
to zero. This illustrates the importance of corner modes in our derivation.
The methodology of this chapter is as follows. First, in Section 11.2 we show that the
dressed symplectic potential (4.20), which we derived back in Section 4.2, reduces onshell to a pure boundary contribution. In fact, only the dressing itself survives, since
the undressed symplectic potential vanishes on-shell. This is a cleaner and shorter
way of deriving the starting point for the discretized potential.
Then, in Section 11.3 we will decompose this boundary contribution into contributions
from each edge. Here we will notice that our earlier formalism forces us to choose,
for each edge (cc0 ), a particular cell c; to alleviate this asymmetry and facilitate the
derivation in the next sections, we will symmetrize the symplectic potential by taking
equal contributions from both c and c0 for each edge.
In Section 11.4 we will manipulate this potential and bring it to a form that will then
allow us to clearly separate the edge contributions from the corner contributions.
Each edge will provide us with two distinct corner contributions, one from each of the
vertices on the boundary of that edge. We will then show how all the contributions
from the edges connected to a particular vertex add up to a total corner contributions
at that vertex, starting with a simple example of three edges in Section 11.5 and then
generalizing to N edges in Section 11.6.
Finally, in Section 11.7 we will analyze our results, where we will see that the edge
terms make up the spin network phase space on each edge (and its dual link), while
the corner terms make up the point particle phase space on each vertex.

11.2

The Symplectic Potential On-Shell

Consider the dressed symplectic potential (4.20):
ˆ
ˆ
ˆ
Θ̂ =
e · δA −
((T + [F, x]) · ∆h − x · δF) −
Σ

Σ

(x · δA − (e + dA x) · ∆h) , (11.1)
∂Σ

81

One possible solution to the equations of motion F = T = 0 is the trivial solution
A = e = 0. Of course, if that is a solution, then any solutions related to it by the gauge
transformations (4.2) are also solutions. Therefore, on-shell we can take A = e = 0,
and we get:
ˆ
dx · ∆h.

Θ̂ =

(11.2)

∂Σ

Now, we decompose Σ into cells as described in Section 6.1. Then
ˆ
dxc · ∆hc ,
Θ̂ = ∑
c

(11.3)

∂c

where hc and xc are the edge modes on the cell c. Note also that
dxc · d∆hc = d (xc · d∆hc ) = −d (dxc · ∆hc ) ,

(11.4)

dxc · d∆hc = d (λxc · d∆hc − (1 − λ) dxc · ∆hc ) ,

(11.5)

so we can write

with λ ∈ [0, 1]. As explained in Section 8.1, λ = 0 corresponds to the usual polarization while λ = 1 corresponds to the dual or teleparallel polarization. Then the dressed
potential becomes (ignoring the overall minus sign)
ˆ
Θ̂ = ∑
(11.6)
(λxc · d∆hc − (1 − λ) dxc · ∆hc ) .
c

∂c

This potential is, of course, exactly the same potential we discussed in the previous chapters, except that hc and xc are now interpreted as edge modes instead of
holonomies.

11.3

From Cells to Edges

As above, the boundary of each cell, ∂c, may be decomposed into individual edges:
∂c =

Nc
[

(cci ) ,

(11.7)

i =1

where ci with i ∈ {1, . . . , Nc } are all the cells adjacent to c, which therefore share edges
(cci ) with it. Thus, we may split the integrals on the boundaries into integrals on the
edges, taking into account that there are two contributions to each edge (cc0 ), one from
the cell c and one from the cells c0 :
ˆ
ˆ
Θ̂ = ∑
Ic = ∑
(11.8)
( Ic0 − Ic ) ,

(cc0 ) (cc )

82

where Ic are the integrands:
Ic ≡ λxc · d∆hc − (1 − λ) dxc · ∆hc .

(11.9)

As before, hc0 and xc0 are related to hc and xc via the continuity conditions (6.48), with
0
constant parameters hcc0 and xcc :

Furthermore, since hcc0 and xcc are constant, we have



d∆hc0 = hc0 c d∆hc hcc0 ,
dxc0 = d hc0 c (xc − xcc )hcc0 = hc0 c dxc hcc0 .

Plugging into the integrand, we get

Ic = λ xc − xc · d∆hc − (1 − λ) dxc · ∆hc − ∆hc ,

(11.14)

and we see that we can cancel some terms:
0

0

Ic0 − Ic = −λxcc · d∆hc + (1 − λ) dxc · ∆hcc .

(11.15)

So far, this is the same expression we dealt with in previous chapters. Note, however,
that now all the expressions are based at c, and none are based at c0 . We can equivalently write an expression where they are based at c0 , simply by exchanging c and
c0 in the above expression (multiplying by an overall minus sign so that we still have
Ic0 − Ic on the right-hand side):
Ic0 − Ic = λxcc0 · d∆hc0 − (1 − λ) dxc0 · ∆hcc0 .

Isolating the Vertex Terms

Consider three cells ci , i ∈ {1, 2, 3}, as illustrated in Figure 8. As we calculated above,
the potentials on the three edges (c1 c2 ), (c2 c3 ), and (c3 c1 ), after cancellations, are
Θc1 c2 = (1 − λ) (xc1 (v2 ) − xc1 (v)) · ∆hcc21 − λxcc21 · (∆hc1 (v2 ) − ∆hc1 (v)) ,

(11.22)

Θc2 c3 = (1 − λ) (xc2 (v3 ) − xc2 (v)) · ∆hcc32 − λxcc32 · (∆hc2 (v3 ) − ∆hc2 (v)) ,

(11.23)

Θc3 c1 = (1 − λ) (xc3 (v1 ) − xc3 (v)) · ∆hcc13 − λxcc13 · (∆hc3 (v1 ) − ∆hc3 (v)) .

From this symmetric form, we can clearly see that each edge term Θci ci+1 has a contribution from its source vertex v and target vertex vi+1 , and both contributions are
symmetric. Therefore, we conclude that the second line in each expression belongs to
the contribution of the potential on the edge to the potential on the vertices v1 , v2 , v3 .
We choose to focus only on the central vertex v, so we can look only at the contributions to v without loss of generality.

∆hci = ∆hvci + hci v ∆hv hvci ,

xci = xvci + hci v xv hvci .

The second line of the vertex potential is similar to the particle potential that we obtained with the puncture picture, except in this case it appears simply due to the gluing between the cells, without any mention of disks or delta functions. We see that the
contributions to the symplectic potential at v would cancel if there was no curvature
or torsion there, but in the general case they do not cancel, and additional degrees of
freedom are created.
In order to obtain exactly the same term, we simply absorb the λ-dependent terms
into new variables, in a similar43 way to the redefinitions we did in Section 8.4

The first term consists of pure edge contributions, and it describes a spin network
phase space and a dual spin network phase space on each pair of edge and its dual
link. The second term consists of pure corner contributions, and it describes a point
particle phase space on each vertex.
The separation between edge and corner contributions clearly plays a crucial role in
understanding the discrete phase space and its relation to the continuous phase space,
as well as the relation between spin networks and piecewise-flat-and-torsionless geometries. We see that spin networks only “know” about the edge contributions, but
properly taking the curvature and torsion into account – together with the redundancies of the discretization and the symmetries associated with them, as we have
discussed above – requires one to acknowledge the corner contributions as well.
43 Note

that here we do not have to worry about the terms at v0 , since the disks are already shrunk.

In the rest of this thesis, we will use the methodology of this chapter to derive similar
results in the more complicated setting of 3+1D gravity.

Part III

3+1 Dimensions: The Continuous
Theory
In the previous chapters of this thesis, we discretized continuous gravity in 2+1 dimensions and obtained the spin network phase space. Of course, in reality, our universe
has 3+1 dimensions. Therefore, in order for our discussion to apply to the real works,
we would like to generalize it to 3+1 dimensions.
In 2+1 dimensions, gravity is topological. The equations of motion, F = T = 0, simply
require that there is no curvature or torsion anywhere. Gravity itself has no dynamical degrees of freedom, and there are no gravitational waves or gravitons. The only
degrees of freedom we took into account in our discussion were the point particle
degrees of freedom, which appeared as codimension-2 point singularities in an otherwise completely featureless spacetime. Dividing the spatial slice into cells yielded
additional artificial degrees of freedom which governed the transformations between
cells.
In 3+1 dimensions, gravity is not topological. In order to apply our calculation to this
case, we must make some simplifying assumptions:
• In 2+1 dimensions, the geometry inside each 2-dimensional cell was flat and
torsionless. In 3+1 dimensions, we will impose by hand that the geometry inside
each 3-dimensional cell should be flat and torsionless.
• In 2+1 dimensions, the matter sources were given as codimension-2 singularities,
which were particles on the 0-dimensional vertices of the 2-dimensional cells. In
3+1 dimensions, the matter sources will also be given as codimension-2 singularities, which will now be strings on the 1-dimensional edges of the 3-dimensional
cells.
• In 2+1 dimensions, we made use of the first-order formalism, with the connection A and frame field e given as Lie-algebra-valued 1-forms. Among other
things, this allowed us to perform calculations elegantly and compactly using
index-free notation. In 3+1 dimensions, the closest thing to this is the formulation of gravity using Ashtekar variables. Therefore, we will work in this formulation.
In Chapter 12 we will derive the Ashtekar variables, which we will use for the remainder of this thesis. Then, in Chapter 13, we will discuss cosmic strings in 3+1
dimensions, mirroring the discussion of point particles in 2+1 dimensions in Chapter
5. Finally, in Chapter 15 we will discretize the symplectic potential. The discretization
will be more involved than that of Chapter 8, but the final result will be remarkably
similar.
91

Derivation of the Ashtekar Variables

Let us now begin the lengthy but important task of deriving the Ashtekar variables.
We will start by describing the first-order formulation of 3+1D gravity, introducing the
spin connection and frame field in Section 12.1, the Holst action in Section 12.2, and
the Hamiltonian formulation in Section 12.3.
In Section 12.4 we will define the Ashtekar variables themselves, along with useful
identities. We will then proceed, in Section 12.5, to rewrite the Hamiltonian action
of first-order gravity using these variables, and define the Gauss, vector, and scalar
constraints. We will derive the symplectic potential in in Section 12.6, and describe
the smeared constraints and the symmetries they generate in Section 12.7. Finally,
Section 12.8 will summarize the results; impatient readers may wish to skip directly
to that section.

12.1

The Spin Connection and Frame Field

Let M = Σ × R be a 3+1-dimensional spacetime manifold, where Σ is a 3-dimensional
spatial slice and R represents time. Please see Section 2.2 for details and conventions.
We define a spacetime so (3, 1) spin connection 1-form ωµI J and a frame field 1-form eµI .
Here we will use partially index-free notation, where only the internal-space indices of
the forms are written explicitly:
e I ≡ eµI dx µ ,

ω I J ≡ ωµI J dx µ .

(12.1)

The frame field is related to the familiar metric by:
g = ηI J eI ⊗ e J

=⇒

gµν = η I J eµI eνJ ,

(12.2)

where η I J is the Minkowski metric acting on the internal space indices. Thus, the
internal space is flat, and the curvature is entirely encoded in the fields e I ; we will see
µ
below that ω I J is completely determined by e I . We also have an inverse frame field44 e I ,
a vector, which satisfies:
e I eνI = δν ,
µ

µ

e I eµJ = δIJ ,
µ

µ

gµν e I eνJ = η I J .

(12.3)

µ

We can view e I as a set of four 4-vectors, e1 , e2 , e3 , and e4 , which form an orthonormal
basis (in Lorentzian signature) with respect to the usual inner product:

h x, yi ≡ gµν x µ yµ

=⇒

he I , e J i = η I J .

(12.4)

The familiar Levi-Civita connection Γλµν is related to the spin connection and frame field
by
I λ J
Γλµν = ωµJ
e I eν + eλI ∂µ eνI ,
(12.5)
µ

the vector e I is called the frame field and the 1-form eµI is called the coframe field, but we
will ignore that subtlety here.
44 Usually

92

such that there is a covariant derivative ∇µ , which acts on both spacetime and internal
indices, and is compatible with (i.e. annihilates) the frame field:
I J
∇µ eνI ≡ ∂µ eνI − Γλµν eλI + ωµJ
eν = 0.

(12.6)

Now, if we act with the covariant derivative on the internal-space Minkowski metric
η I J , we find:
J
I
∇µ η I J = ∂µ η I J + ωµK
η K J + ωµK
η IK .
(12.7)
Of course, η I J is constant in spacetime, so ∂µ η I J = 0. If we furthermore demand that
the spin connection is metric-compatible with respect to the internal-space metric, that
is ∇µ η I J = 0, then we get
(I J)

J
I
0 = ωµK
η K J + ωµK
η IK = ωµI J + ωµJ I = 2ωµ .

(12.8)

We thus conclude that the spin connection must be anti-symmetric in its internal indices:
(I J)
[I J]
ωµ = 0 =⇒ ωµI J = ωµ .
(12.9)
Let us also define the covariant differential dω as follows:
dω φ ≡ dφ,

dω X I ≡ dX I + ω I J ∧ X J ,

(12.10)

where φ is a scalar in the internal space and X I is a vector in the internal space. With
this we may define the torsion 2-form:
T I ≡ dω e I = de I + ω I J ∧ e J ,

(12.11)

F I J ≡ dω ω I J = dω I J + ω I K ∧ ω K J .

(12.12)

and the curvature 2-form:

Note that dω , unlike d, is not nilpotent. Instead, it satisfies the first Bianchi identity

The δω Variation and the Definition of the Spin Connection

From the variation with respect to δω we see that the torsion 2-form must vanish:
T I ≡ dω e I = de I + ω IJ ∧ e J = 0.
45 Usually there is also a factor of 1/κ

(12.20)

in front of the action, where κ ≡ 8πG and G is Newton’s constant.
However, here we take κ ≡ 1 for brevity.

94

In fact, we can take this equation of motion as a definition of ω. In other words,
the only independent variable in our theory is going to be the frame field e I , and the
spin connection ω I J is going to be completely determined by e I . Once ω is defined
in this way, it automatically satisfies this equation of motion (or equivalently, there
is no variation with respect to δω in the first place since ω is not an independent
variable). The formulation where e and ω are independent is called first-order, and
when ω depends on e it is called second-order.
Note that in the usual metric formulation of general relativity, the Levi-Civita connecµ
tion Γαβ is also taken to be torsionless, but in the teleparallel formulation we instead
use a connection (the Weitzenböck connection) which is flat but has torsion; see Chapter 3.4 for more details.
Let us look at the anti-symmetric part of the compatibility condition (12.6):

∇[µ eν] I = ∂[µ eν] I + ω[µ| IL| eνL] = 0.

(12.21)

Note that the term Γλµν eλI vanishes automatically from this equation since Γλ[µν] = 0
from requiring that the Levi-Civita connection is torsion-free. Also, the anti-symmetrizer
in ω[µ| IL| eνL] acts on the spacetime indices only (i.e. µ and ν are not inside the antiµ

symmetrizer). Contracting with e J eKν , we get


µ
e J eKν ∂[µ eν] I + ω[µ| IL| eνL] = 0.

(12.22)

We now permute the indices I, J, K in this equation:

e I e J ∂[µ eν]K + ω[µ|KL| eν] = 0,

(12.23)
(12.24)

Taking the sum of the last two equations minus the first one, we get:
0 = e I eνJ ∂[µ eν]K + eK eνI ∂[µ eν] J − e J eKν ∂[µ eν] I + e I eνJ ω[µ|KL| eνL] + eK eνI ω[µ| JL| eνL] − e J eKν ω[µ| IL| eνL]

Rearranging and relabeling the indices, we obtain the slightly more elegant form:

= eλI ∂[µ eλJ ] − eλJ ∂[µ eλI ] − eµK eλI eσJ ∂[λ eσK]
J]

= 2eλ[ I ∂[µ eλ] − eµK eλI eσJ ∂[λ eσK] ,
where the first term contains an anti-symmetrizer in both the spacetime and internal
space indices. Thus, ω is completely determined by e, just as Γ is completely determined by g in the usual metric formulation.

Note that, from the Bianchi identity (12.13), we have e J ∧ F I J = d2ω e J = 0 by the torsion
condition (12.20). In other words, the γ-dependent term vanishes on-shell, i.e., when
the torsion vanishes. We are therefore left with
e J ∧ ? F I J = 0,

(12.27)

which is the Einstein equation Rµν − 12 gµν R = 0 in first-order form. Note that this
equation is independent of γ; therefore, the γ-dependent term in the action does not
affect the physics, at least not at the level of the classical equation of motion.
Let us prove that this is indeed the Einstein equation. We have

The Hamiltonian Formulation

12.3.1

The 3+1 Split and the Time Gauge

To go to the Hamiltonian formulation, we split our spacetime manifold M into space
Σ and time R. We remind the reader that, as detailed in Section 2.2, the spacetime and
spatial indices on both real space and the internal space are related as follows:

convention that, if the indices are lowered, each pair could be either the first or second pair of indices,
γδ
γδ
as long as they are adjacent. In other words, gαγ g βδ Rµν = Rµναβ or equivalently gαγ g βδ Rµν = Rαβµν .

97

Let us decompose the 1-form e I ≡ eµI dx µ :
e0 ≡ e0µ dx µ = e00 dx0 + e0a dx a ,

ei ≡ eiµ dx µ = e0i dx0 + eia dx a .

(12.39)

Here we merely changed notation from 3+1D spacetime indices I, µ to 3D spatial indices i, a. However, now we are going to impose a partial gauge fixing, the time gauge,
given by
e0a = 0.
(12.40)
We also define

e0i ≡ N i ,

e00 ≡ N,

(12.41)

where N is called the lapse and N i is called the shift, as in the ADM formalism. In other
words, we have:
e0 = N dx0 ,
ei = N i dx0 + eia dx a ,
(12.42)
or in matrix form,


N


eµI = 

(12.43)

As we will soon see, N and N i are non-dynamical Lagrange multipliers, so we are left
with eia as the only dynamical degrees of freedom of the frame field – although they
will be further reduced by the internal gauge symmetry.
12.3.2

The Hamiltonian

In order to derive the Hamiltonian, we are going to have to sacrifice the elegant indexfree differential form language (for now) and write everything in terms of indices. This
will allow us to perform the 3+1 split in those indices. Writing the differential forms
explicitly in coordinate basis, that is, e I ≡ eµI dx µ and so on, we get:

Note that dx µ ∧ dx ν ∧ dx ρ ∧ dx σ is a wedge produce of 1-forms, and is therefore completely anti-symmetric in the indices µνρσ, just like the Levi-Civita symbol47 ẽµνρσ .
Thus we can write:
dx µ ∧ dx ν ∧ dx ρ ∧ dx σ = −ẽµνρσ dx0 ∧ dx1 ∧ dx2 ∧ dx3 ,
47 The

(12.47)

tilde on the Levi-Civita symbol signifies that it is not a tensor but a tensor density. The symbol
is defined as


+1 if (µνρσ ) is an even permutation of (0123) ,
ẽµνρσ ≡ −1 if (µνρσ ) is an odd permutation of (0123) ,
(12.44)


0
if any two indices are the same.

98

where the minus sign comes from the fact that sign ( g) = −1, and we defined ẽµνρσ ≡
sign ( g) ẽµνρσ . To see that this relation is satisfied, simply plug in values for µ, ν, ρ, σ
and compare both sides. For example, for (µνρσ) = (0123) we have:

− ẽ0123 = ẽ0123 = +1,

(12.48)

and both sides are satisfied. We thus have

Plugging this into the Holst action, we get:48

By definition this quantity has the same values in every coordinate system, and thus it cannot be a
tensor. Let us define a tensor density T̃ as a quantity related to a proper tensor T by
T̃ = | g|−w/2 T,

(12.45)

where g is the determinant of the metric and w is called the density weight. It can be shown that
ẽµνρσ ≡ g−1/2 eµνρσ ,

(12.46)

and therefore the Levi-Civita symbol is a tensor density of weight +1.
48 We chose to write down the internal space Minkowski metric η explicitly so that internal space
IJ
indices I, J, . . . on differential forms can always be upstairs and spacetime indices µ, ν, . . . can always
be downstairs. This will also remind us that terms with I, J = 0 in the summation should get a minus
sign, since η00 = −1.

The Ashtekar Variables

12.4.1

The Densitized Triad and Related Identities

Let us define the densitized triad, which is a rank (1, 0) tensor of density weight50 −1:
Ẽia ≡ det (e) eia .

(12.58)

The inverse triad eia is related to the inverse metric g ab via
g ab = eia ebj δij .

(12.59)

Multiplying by det ( g) = det (e)2 we get
det ( g) g ab = Ẽia Ẽbj δij .
50 See

(12.60)

Footnote
47 for the definition of a tensor density. The densitized triad has weight −1 since
p
det (e) = det ( g) has weight −1.

101

We now prove some identities. First, consider the determinant identity for a 3-dimensional
matrix,
j
eijk eia eb eck = det (e) ẽabc .
(12.61)
Multiplying by ela and using eia ela = δli , we get
j

j

eljk eb eck = eijk eia eb eck ela = det (e) ela ẽabc = Ẽla ẽabc .

(12.62)

Next, multiplying by ẽbcd and using the identity
ẽabc ẽbcd = 2δad ,

(12.63)

we get
j

ẽbcd eljk eb eck = Ẽla ẽabc ẽbcd = 2Ẽld .

(12.64)

Renaming indices, we obtain the identity
Ẽia =

1 abc
j
ẽ eijk eb eck .
2

(12.65)

Similarly, one may prove the identity
eia
Since

=

eijk ẽabc Ẽbj Ẽkc
2 det (e)

.


det Ẽ = det (det (e) eia ) = (det (e))2 ,

(12.66)

we obtain an expression for the triad 1-form solely in terms of the densitized triad:

The Ashtekar-Barbero Connection

Since we have performed a 3+1 split of the spin connection ωµI J , we can use its individual components to define a new connection on the spatial slice.
ij

First, we use the fact that the spatial part of the spin connection, ωa , is anti-symmetric
in the internal indices, and thus it behaves as a 2-form on the internal space. This
means that we can take its Hodge dual, and obtain a dual spin connection Γia :
1
jk
Γia ≡ − eijk ωa
2

⇐⇒

jk

jk

ωa = −ei Γia .

(12.73)

The minus sign here is meant to make the Gauss law, which we will derive shortly,
have the same relative sign as the Gauss law from 2+1D gravity and Yang-Mills theory;
note that, in some other sources, Γia is defined without this minus sign.
Importantly, instead of two internal indices, Γia only has one. We can do this only in
3 dimensions, since the Hodge dual takes a k-form into a (3 − k )-form. We are lucky
that we do, in fact, live in a 3+1-dimensional spacetime, otherwise this simplification
would not have been possible!
Next, we define the extrinsic curvature Kai :
Kai ≡ ωai0 = −ωa0i .

(12.74)

Again, this definition differs by a minus sign from some other sources. Note that we
will extend both definitions to a = 0, for brevity only; Γ0 and K0 will not be dynamical
variables, as we shall see.
Using the dual spin connection and the extrinsic curvature, we may now define the
Ashtekar-Barbero connection Aia :
Aia ≡ Γia + γKai .
(12.75)
The original spin connection ωµI J was 1-form on spacetime which had two internal
indices, and was valued in the Lie algebra of the Lorentz group, also known as so (3, 1).
103

In short, it was an so (3, 1)-valued 1-form on spacetime51 . The three quantities we have
defined, Γia , Kai , and Aia , resulted from reducing both spacetime and the internal space
from 3+1 dimensions to 3 dimensions. Thus, they are 1-forms on 3-dimensional space,
not spacetime, and the internal space is now invariant under so (3) only.
Since the Lie algebras so (3) and su (2) are isomorphic, and since in Yang-Mills theory we use su (2), we might as well use su (2) as the symmetry of our internal space
instead of so (3). Thus, the quantities Γia , Kai and Aia are all su (2)-valued 1-forms on
3-dimensional space. We can also, however, work more generally with some unspecified (compact) Lie algebra g, similar to what we did in the previous chapters. We will
again use index-free notation, as defined in (2.3). In particular, we will write for the
connection, frame field, dual connection and extrinsic curvature:
A ≡ Aia τ i dx a ,

e ≡ eia τ i dx a ,

Γ ≡ Γia τ i dx a ,

K ≡ Kai τ i dx a ,

(12.76)

where τ i are the generators of g.
12.4.3

The Dual Spin Connection in Terms of the Frame Field

Recall that in the Lagrangian formulation we had the torsion equation of motion
T I ≡ dω e I = de I + ω IJ ∧ e J = 0.

(12.77)

Explicitly, the components of the 2-form T I are:
1 I
(12.78)
Tµν = ∂[µ eνI ] + η JK ω[IµJ eνK] .
2
Taking the spatial components after a 3+1 split in both spacetime and the internal
space, we get
1 i
ij
(12.79)
Tab = ∂[a eib] − ω[i0a e0b] + δjk ω[a ebk] .
2
However, after imposing the time gauge e0b = 0 the middle term vanishes:
1 i
ij
Tab = ∂[a eib] + δjk ω[a ebk] .
2

(12.80)

Let us now plug in
ij

ωa = −el Γla ,

(12.81)

to get
1 i
ij
Tab = ∂[a eib] − δjk el Γl[a ebk]
2
i k l
= ∂[a eib] + ekl
Γ[ a eb]

≡ D[a eib] ,
generators of the Lorentz algebra are L I J with I, J ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3}, and they are anti-symmetric in
I and J. They are related to rotations J I and boosts K I by J I = 12 e I JK L JK and K I = L0I .
51 The

where we have defined the covariant derivative Da , which acts on g-valued 1-forms eib
as
i k l
Da eib ≡ ∂ a eib + ekl
Γ a eb .
(12.82)
The equation Da eib = 0 can be seen as the definition of Γia in terms of eia , just as dω e I = 0
defines ω I J in terms of e I .
In index-free notation, the spatial torsion equation of motion is simply
T = dΓ e = de + [Γ, e] = 0,
where
T≡

(12.83)

1 i
Tab τ i dx a ∧ dx b
2

(12.84)

is a g-valued 2-form.
12.4.4

The “Electric Field”

We now define the electric field 2-form E as (half) the commutator of two frame fields:
1
(12.85)
[e, e] .
2
This is analogous to the electric field in electromagnetism and Yang-Mills theory, and
indeed, the main reason for defining the Ashtekar variables is to make gravity look
like Yang-Mills theory.
In terms of components, we have
E≡

E≡

1 i
Eab τ i dx a ∧ dx b ,
2

i
Eab
=

[e, e]iab = eijk ea ebk .

(12.86)

j

Alternatively, starting from the definition Ẽic ≡ 21 ẽ abc eijk ea ebk of the densitized triad, we
multiply both sides by ẽcde and get:


1 a b
1

ẽcde Ẽic =
ẽcde ẽ abc eijk ea ebk =
δd δe − δea δdb eijk ea ebk = eijk ed eek ,
(12.87)
2
2
which gives us the electric field in terms of the densitized triad:
i
Eab
= ẽabc δij Ẽcj .

(12.88)

Note that in the definition we “undensitize” the densitized triad, which is a tensor
density of weight −1, by contracting it with the Levi-Civita tensor density, which has
weight 1. The 2-form E is thus a proper tensor.
Now, since E = [e, e] /2, we have
1
(12.89)
dΓ E = dΓ [e, e] = [dΓ e, e] = [T, e] = 0.
2
Therefore, just like the frame field e, the electric field E is also torsionless with respect
to the connection Γ.

they must vanish, since F kl must be anti-symmetric in k, l.

(12.109)

The first term is clearly a kinetic term, indicating that Akc and Ẽkc are conjugate variables.
The second term imposes the Gauss constraint, which, as we will see in Section 12.7,
generates SU (2) gauge transformations. As for the third term, we will show in the
j
next subsection that it vanishes by the definition of Γc .
12.5.3

The Gauss Constraint in Index-Free Notation

We can write the Gauss constraint in index-free notation. The covariant differential of
E in terms of the connection A is given by
dA E ≡ dE + [A, E] .

(12.110)

The components of this 3-form, defined as usual by
dA E =

1
(dA E)iabc τ i dx a ∧ dx b ∧ dx c ,
6

(12.111)

are given by

(dA E)iabc = (dE)iabc + [A, E]iabc

(12.112)

Next, we use the relation
dx a ∧ dx b ∧ dx c = ẽ abc dx1 ∧ dx2 ∧ dx3 ≡ ẽ abc d3 x,

(12.113)

along with the identity
ẽdbc ẽ abc = 2δda ,

Finally, we smear this 3-form inside a 3-dimensional integral, with a Lagrange multiplier λ ≡ λi τ i :
ˆ
ˆ


j
λ · dA E = λi ∂ a Ẽia + eijk A a Ẽka d3 x.
(12.115)
We thus see that demanding dA E = 0 is equivalent to demanding that (12.108) vanishes:
j
G = dA E = 0 ⇐⇒ Gi ≡ ∂ a Ẽia + eijk A a Ẽka = 0.
(12.116)
j

j

Let us also write (12.89) with indices in the same way, replacing A a with Γ a :
dΓ E = 0

j

∂ a Ẽia + eijk Γ a Ẽka = 0.

⇐⇒

(12.117)

Taking the difference of the two constraints, we get
dA E − dΓ E = (dE + [Γ + γK, E]) − (dE + [Γ, E])
= γ [K, E]
= 0,
or with indices,

[K, E] = 0

j

eki Kai Ẽja = 0.

=⇒

(12.118)

Now, the extrinsic curvature with two spatial indices is symmetric:
Kab = K(ab) ,

K[ab] = 0.

It is related to Kai by

j

Kab = Kai eb δij .

(12.119)

(12.120)

Thus, the condition that its anti-symmetric part vanishes is
j

K[ab] = K[ia eb] δij = 0.
109

(12.121)

Contracting with det (e) eklm eka elb , we get
j

0 = det (e) eklm eka elb K[ia eb] δij

Therefore, Gk = 0 is also equivalent to K[ab] = 0. Yet another way to write this constraint, in index-free notation, is to define a new quantity [50]

such that

P ≡ dA e,

(12.122)

1
dA E = dA [e, e] = [dA e, e] = [P, e] .
2

(12.123)

Finally, given (12.117) we can simplify (12.109) to
L1 = Ẽkc ∂0 Akc + λi Gi .

The part with G p is redundant – the Gauss constraint is already enforced by L1 , and
we can combine the second term of L2 with L1 by redefining some fields. Thus we get

L2 = − N a Ẽbp Fab .

(12.131)

We can now define the vector (or momentum) constraint:
p

Va ≡ Ẽbp Fab .

(12.132)

Then L2 simply enforces this constraint with the Lagrange multiplier N a :
L2 = − N a Va .

(12.133)

In Section 12.7 we will discuss how this constraint is related to spatial diffeomorphisms.

P ≡ dA e = de + [A, e]

The Constraints as Generators of Symmetries

Let C be the space of smooth connections on Σ. The kinematical (unconstrained) phase
space of 3+1-dimensional gravity is given by the cotangent bundle P ≡ T ∗ C . To get
the physical (that is, gauge-invariant) phase space, we must perform symplectic reductions with respect to the constraints. These constraints are best understood in their
smeared form as generators of gauge transformations. The smeared Gauss constraint
can be written as
ˆ
1
G (α) ≡
λ · dA E,
(12.166)
2 Σ
where λ is a g-valued 0-form. This constraint generates the infinitesimal G gauge
transformations:
(12.167)
{A, G (λ)} ∝ dA λ,
{E, G (λ)} ∝ [E, λ] .
The smeared vector constraint is given by

ˆ

V (ξ ) ≡

Σ

N · [e, F] ,

(12.168)

where ξ a is a spatial vector and the Lagrange multiplier N i ≡ ξ a eia is a g-valued 0-form.
From the Gauss and vector constraints we may construct the diffeomorphism constraint:

D (ξ ) ≡ V (ξ ) − G (ξ y A) ,

(12.169)

where ξ y A ≡ ξ a Aia τ i is an interior product (see Footnote 20). This constraint generates the infinitesimal spatial diffeomorphism transformations

{A, D (ξ )} ∝ Lξ A,

{E, D (ξ )} ∝ Lξ E,

(12.170)

where Lξ is the Lie derivative.

Cosmic Strings in 3+1 Dimensions

We now generalize the discussion of point particles in 2+1 dimensions, which we derived in Chapter 5, to one more dimension, obtaining (cosmic) strings in 3+1 dimensions.

121

13.1

Proof that d2 φ = 2πδ(2) (r )

We begin by proving a relation between d2 φ and the Dirac delta 2-form in cylindrical
coordinates, similar to the one we derived in Section 5.1.
Let us define a cylinder Σ with coordinates (r, φ, z) such that


L
L
r ∈ [0, R] ,
φ ∈ [0, 2π ) ,
z ∈ − ,+
.
(13.1)

2
Furthermore, let
f ≡ f r dr + f φ dφ + f z dz

(13.2)

∂φ f z (r = 0) = 0.

(13.3)

be a test 1-form such that
The condition (13.3) means that that value of the 1-form on the string itself, f (r = 0),
is the same for each value of φ. This certainly makes sense, as different values of φ at
r = 0 (for a particular choice of z) correspond to the same point.
We define a 2-form distribution δ(2) (r ) such that
ˆ
ˆ
(2)
f ∧ δ (r ) =
Σ

f,

(13.4)

{r =0}

where {r = 0} is the line along the z axis. Let us now show that the 2-form d2 φ satisfies
this definition.
Using the graded Leibniz rule we have, since f is a 1-form,
f ∧ d2 φ = d f ∧ dφ − d ( f ∧ dφ) .

(13.5)

Integrating this on Σ, we get
ˆ
ˆ
ˆ
2
f ∧d φ =
d f ∧ dφ − d ( f ∧ dφ) .

(13.6)

The second integral in (13.6) can easily be integrated using Stokes’ theorem:

d ( f ∧ dφ) =
f ∧ dφ =
( f r dr + f z dz) ∧ dφ.

(13.13)

{r =0}

Given (13.4), we see that indeed d2 φ = 2πδ(2) (r ), as we wanted to prove.
Note that the delta 2-form distribution may be written as
δ(2) (r ) = δ (r ) dx ∧ dy = δ (r ) r dr ∧ dφ,

(13.14)

where δ (r ) is the usual 1-dimensional delta function. Therefore we have
d2 φ = 2πδ (r ) r dr ∧ dφ.

13.2

(13.15)

The Frame Field and Spin Connection

To describe a cosmic string in 3+1 dimensions, we use cylindrical coordinates (t, r, φ, z)
with the (infinite) string lying along the z axis. The metric will be similar to (5.29),
except that now the parameter S will cause periodicity in the z direction instead of the
t direction:
dr2
+ r2 dφ2 + (dz + S dφ)2 .
(13.16)
ds2 = −dt2 +
2
(1 − M )
Similar to the 2+1D case, we can define
T ≡ t,

R≡

r
,
1−M

Φ ≡ (1 − M) φ,

Z ≡ z + Sφ,

(13.17)

and the metric becomes flat:
ds2 = −dT 2 + dR2 + R2 dΦ2 + dZ2 ,

(13.18)

with the periodicity conditions
Φ ∼ Φ + 2π (1 − M ) ,

Z ∼ Z + 2πS.

(13.19)

Since we do not have a time shift, we will not create closed timelike curves, which may
potentially violate causality. Instead, the periodicity is in the Z direction. When we
foliate spacetime into 3-dimensional spatial slices in order to go to the Hamiltonian
formulation, Z will play the same role that T played in the 2+1D case (which did not
involve a foliation).
We proceed as in the 2+1D case. First we define the frame fields:
e0 = dT,

e1 = dR,

e2 = R dΦ,
124

e3 = dZ.

(13.20)

Unfortunately, the trick we used in 2+1D, which allowed us to have only one internal
index in the spin connection, does not work in 3+1D, since the Hodge dual will simply
turn 2 indices into 4 − 2 = 2 indices. Thus, we must use the following definition of
the torsion 2-form:
T I ≡ dω e I = de I + ω I J ∧ e J .
(13.21)
The four components of the torsion are:
T 0 = ω 0 1 ∧ dR + ω 0 2 ∧ R dΦ + ω 0 3 ∧ dZ,

(13.22)

T 1 = ω 1 0 ∧ dT + ω 1 2 ∧ R dΦ + ω 1 3 ∧ dZ,

(13.23)

T 2 = dR ∧ dΦ + ω 2 0 ∧ dT + ω 2 1 ∧ dR + ω 2 3 ∧ dZ,

(13.24)

T 3 = ω 3 0 ∧ dT + ω 3 1 ∧ dR + ω 3 2 ∧ R dΦ.

(13.25)

In order for the torsion to vanish, all of the components of ω I J must be set to zero
except
ω 2 1 = dΦ,
(13.26)
which is needed in order to cancel the dR ∧ dΦ term in T 2 . Note that, since the metric
on the internal space is flat, we have that ω 2 1 = ω 21 = −ω 12 = dΦ. Finally, we go
back to the original coordinates using (13.17):
ω 2 1 = (1 − M) dφ = −ω 1 2 ,

e0 = dt,

e1 =

dr
,
1−M

e2 = r dφ,

e3 = dz + S dφ.
(13.27)

Then the torsion becomes
T 0 = T 1 = T 2 = 0,

T 3 = S d2 φ = 2πSδ (r ) dr ∧ dφ.

(13.28)

We may also calculate the curvature of the spin connection, which is defined as
R I J ≡ dω ω I J = dω I J + ω I K ∧ ω K J .

(13.29)

Its components will all be zero, except
R1 2 = − R2 1 = − (1 − M ) d2 φ = −2π (1 − M) δ (r ) dr ∧ dφ.

13.3

(13.30)

The Foliation of Spacetime and the Ashtekar Variables

To go to the Hamiltonian formulation, we perform the 3+1 split and impose the time
gauge, as detailed in Section 12.3.1:
e0 = N dt,

ei = N i dt + eia dx a .

(13.31)

From (13.27) we see that we are already in the time gauge, and the lapse and shift are
trivial, N = 1 and N i = 0, as one would indeed expect from a flat spacetime.
125

Since the spatial slices are 3-dimensional, we can now use the trick of turning two
internal-space indices into one by defining the dual spin connection as in the 2+1dimensional case:
1
(13.32)
Γi ≡ − ei jk ω jk .
2
Since the only non-zero components of ω ij are ω 21 = −ω 12 = (1 − M) dφ, we get:
Γ1 = Γ2 = 0,

Γ3 = (1 − M ) dφ.

(13.33)

The frame field on each spatial slice is simply
e1 =

dr
,
1−M

e2 = r dφ,

e3 = dz + S dφ.

(13.34)

We can now use index-free notation again:
τ 1 dr
+ τ 3 dz + (Sτ 3 + rτ 2 ) dφ.
1−M

(13.35)

T ≡ dΓ e = de + [Γ, e] = Sτ 3 d2 φ = 2πS δ (r ) τ 3 dr ∧ dφ.

(13.36)

Γ = (1 − M) τ 3 dφ,

e=

The torsion will be

As we derived above, the first Ashtekar variable is the electric field E, defined as
E≡

1
[e, e]
2

=⇒

Ei =

1 i j
e e ∧ ek .
2 jk

(13.37)

Calculating it, we get
E=

(rτ 3 − Sτ 2 ) dr ∧ dφ + (τ 1 + τ 2 ) dz ∧ dr
+ rτ 1 dφ ∧ dz.
1−M

(13.38)

The second Ashtekar variables is the Ashtekar-Barbero connection A, defined as
A ≡ Γ + γK,

(13.39)

where γ is the Barbero-Immirzi parameter and K is the extrinsic curvature, defined as
Kai ≡ ωai0 .

(13.40)

In our case, it is clear that the extrinsic curvature vanishes; this makes sense, as we are
on equal-time slices in an essentially flat spacetime. Therefore the Ashtekar connection
is in fact identical to the dual spin connection:
A = Γ = (1 − M ) τ 3 dφ.

(13.41)

The curvatures of these connections are:
R ≡ dΓ Γ = dΓ +
126

1
[Γ, Γ] ,
2

(13.42)

F ≡ dA A = dA +

1
[A, A] ,
2

(13.43)

and they are both equal to:
R = F = (1 − M ) τ 3 d2 φ = 2π (1 − M) δ (r ) τ 3 dr ∧ dφ.

(13.44)

We may define m ≡ (1 − M) τ 3 and s ≡ Sτ 3 , where τ 3 takes the role that τ 0 had in
the 2+1D case. Then we may write
Γ = A = m dφ,

e=

τ 1 dr
+ τ 3 dz + (s + rτ 2 ) dφ,
1−M

(13.45)

R = F = 2πm δ (r ) dr ∧ dφ.

(13.46)

T = P = 2πs δ (r ) dr ∧ dφ,

13.4

The Dressed Quantities

As in the 2+1-dimensional case, in order to make the connection and frame field invariant under a gauge transformation, we must dress them. Then we get:
Γ = A = h−1 mh dφ + h−1 dh,

(13.47)

e = h−1 (dx + (s + [m, x]) dφ) h,


−1 1
E=h
[dx, dx] + [dx, (s + [m, x]) dφ] h,
2

(13.48)
(13.49)

R = F = 2πh−1 mh δ (r ) dr ∧ dφ,

(13.50)

T = P = 2πh−1 (s + [m, x]) h δ (r ) dr ∧ dφ.

(13.51)

We see that we have essentially obtained exactly the same expressions as for the point
particle in 2+1 dimensions – unsurprisingly, since we explicitly started with the same
metric as in 2+1 dimensions, only with one more dimension. A string is simply a
delta-function source of curvature and torsion in an otherwise flat and torsionless
spacetime. Just as we did in Section 5.4, we can write the curvature and torsion in
terms of “momentum” p and “angular momentum” j:
R = F = 2πp δ (r ) dr ∧ dφ,

T = P = 2πj δ (r ) dr ∧ dφ.

The Discrete Geometry

14.1

The Cellular Decomposition and Its Dual

The cellular decomposition in the 3+1-dimensional case is similar to the one we had
in the 2+1-dimensional case, as described in Section 6.1, except that there is, of course,
one more dimension. Each element of the cellular decomposition ∆ is uniquely dual
to an element of the dual cellular decomposition ∆∗ . Cells c are now 3-dimensional but
still dual to nodes c∗ , sides s form the 2-dimensional boundaries of the cells and are dual
to links s∗ which connect the nodes, edges e form the 1-dimensional boundaries of the
sides and are dual to faces e∗ , and vertices v are dual to volumes v∗ . This is summarized
in the following table:
∆
0-cells (vertices) v
1-cells (edges) e
2-cells (sides) s
3-cells (cells) c

dual to
dual to
dual to
dual to

∆∗
3-cells (volumes) v∗
2-cells (faces) e∗
1-cells (links) s∗
0-cells (nodes) c∗

We will write:
• c = (s1 , . . . , sn ) to indicate that the boundary of the cell c is composed of the n
sides s1 , . . . , sn .
• s = (e1 , . . . , en ) to indicate that the boundary of the side s is composed of the n
edges e1 , . . . , en .
• s = (cc0 ) to indicate that the side s is shared by the two cells c, c0 .
∗

• s∗ = (cc0 ) to indicate that the link s∗ (dual to the side s) connects the two nodes
c∗ and c0∗ (dual to the cells c, c0 ).
• e = (c1 , . . . , cn ) to indicate the the edge e is shared by the n cells c1 , . . . , cn .
• e = (s1 , . . . , sn ) to indicate the the edge e is shared by the n sides s1 , . . . , sn .
• e = (vv0 ) to indicate that the edge e connects the two vertices v, v0 .
This construction is illustrated in Figure 9.

128

Figure 9: A simple discretization with two cells (in red) and a dual spin
network (in blue). Here, the discretization is the simplest possible one: a
simplicial complex, where the cells are 3-simplices (tetrahedrons) and their
faces are 2-simplices (triangles). The edges are 1-simplices (line segments),
and the vertices are, of course, 0-simplices (points). However, our formalism also allows the cells to be arbitrary convex polyhedra and the faces to
be arbitrary convex polygons. From the figure, it should be clear that each
of the two cells is dual to a node (located inside it), and each of the faces is
dual to a link, with the face shared by the two cells dual to the link connecting the two nodes. This is further illustrated by Figure 10.

connects, the (triangular) face shared by the two cells, and the edges on the
boundary on that face (which are, as illustrated, oriented) – and dimmed
everything else.
In the 3+1-dimensional case, it would make sense to generalize the disks we defined
in the 2+1-dimensional case to cylinders which surround the edges. This construction
is left for future work; in this thesis, we will not worry about regularizing the singularities, and instead just use holonomies to probe the curvature and torsion in an indirect
130

manner, as will be shown below.

Truncating the Geometry to the Edges

The connection and frame field inside each cell c – that is, on the interior of the cell, but
not on the edges and vertices – are taken to be

in analogy with the 2+1D case. Since they correspond to

P ≡ dA e = 0,

(14.2)

they trivially solve all of the constraints:

[e, P] = [e, F] = e · F −

as discussed in Chapter 13, and pe and je are constant algebra elements encoding the
curvature and torsion, respectively, on each edge52 . These distributional curvature
and torsion describe a network of cosmic strings: 1-dimensional topological defects
carrying curvature and torsion in an otherwise flat spacetime. The expressions (14.4)
are derived from first principles in Chapter 13.
This construction describes a piecewise-flat-and-torsionless geometry; the cells are flat and
torsionless, and the curvature and torsion are located only on the edges of the cells.
We may interpret the 1-skeleton Γ, the set of all edges in the cellular decomposition ∆,
as a network of cosmic strings.
The reason for considering this particular geometry comes from the assumption that
the geometry can only be probed by taking loops of holonomies along the spin network. Imagine a 3-dimensional slice Σ with arbitrary geometry. We first embed a
spin network Γ∗ , which can be any graph, in Σ. Then we draw a dual graph, Γ, such
that each edge of Γ passes through exactly one loop of Γ∗ . We take a holonomy along
each of the loops of Γ∗ , and encode the result on the edges of Γ. The resulting discrete
52 We

geometry is exactly the one we described above, and it is completely equivalent to
the continuous geometry with which we started, since the holonomies along the spin
network cannot tell the difference between the continuous geometry and the discrete
one.
In short, given a choice of a particular spin network, an arbitrary continuous geometry
may be reduced to an equivalent discrete geometry, given by a network of cosmic
strings, one for each loop of the spin network.

Discretizing the Symplectic Potential
First Step: From Continuous to Discrete Variables

We start with the symplectic potential obtained in (12.165),
ˆ
Θ = − E · δA.
Σ

(15.1)

Using the identity
1
δA c = h−
c (d∆hc ) hc ,

the potential becomes
Θ = −∑
c

(15.2)

ˆ

[dxc , dxc ] · d∆hc .

(15.3)

c

To use Stokes’ theorem in the first integral, we note that

[dxc , dxc ] · d∆hc = d ([dxc , dxc ] · ∆hc ) = d ([xc , dxc ] · d∆hc ) ,

(15.4)

hence we can write

[dxc , dxc ] · d∆hc = (1 − λ) d ([dxc , dxc ] · ∆hc ) + λd ([xc , dxc ] · d∆hc ) ,
so
Θ = −∑
c

(15.5)

ˆ

((1 − λ) [dxc , dxc ] · ∆hc + λ [xc , dxc ] · d∆hc ) .

(15.6)

∂c

As in the 2+1D case, we have a family of polarizations corresponding to different
values of λ ∈ [0, 1].

15.2

Second Step: From Cells to Sides

Next we decompose the boundary ∂c of each cell c = (s1 , . . . , sn ) into sides s1 , . . . , sn .
Each side s = (cc0 ) will have exactly two contributions, one from the cell c and another,
with opposite sign, from the cell c0 . We thus rewrite Θ as
ˆ
Θ=− ∑
(15.7)
( Ic0 − Ic ) ,
0
(cc0 ) (cc )

132

where

Ic ≡ (1 − λ) [dxc , dxc ] · ∆hc + λ [xc , dxc ] · d∆hc .

(15.8)

Now, in the 3+1D case we have the continuity conditions, derived in the same way as
in Section 6.4:
0
h c0 = h c0 c h c ,
xc0 = hc0 c (xc − xcc )hcc0 ,
(15.9)


0
∆hc0 = ∆ (hc0 c hc ) = hc0 c ∆hc − ∆hcc hcc0 ,
(15.10)
d∆hc0 = hc0 c d∆hc hcc0 ,


0
dxc0 = d hc0 c (xc − xcc )hcc0 = hc0 c dxc hcc0 ,

(15.11)
(15.12)

where all of the conditions are valid only on the side s = (cc0 ). Using these conditions,
we find that
Ic0 = (1 − λ) [dxc0 , dxc0 ] · ∆hc0 + λ [xc0 , dxc0 ] · d∆hc0


h
i
c0
c0
= (1 − λ) [dxc , dxc ] · ∆hc − ∆hc + λ xc − xc , dxc · d∆hc .
Comparing with Ic , we see that many terms cancel, and we are left with

Since ∆hcc and xcc are constant, we may rewrite this as

ˆ

[dxc , dxc ] + λxc ·

[dxc , d∆hc ] .

(15.14)

Now, in order to use Stokes’ theorem again, we can write

and

[dxc , dxc ] = d [xc , dxc ] ,

(15.15)

[dxc , d∆hc ] = d [xc , d∆hc ] = −d [dxc , ∆hc ] ,

(15.16)

which we write, defining an additional polarization parameter µ ∈ [0, 1], as

[dxc , d∆hc ] = (1 − µ) d [xc , d∆hc ] − µd [dxc , ∆hc ] .

(15.17)

The symplectic potential now becomes

(15.18)
and it describes a two-parameter family of potentials for each value of λ ∈ [0, 1] and
µ ∈ [0, 1].
133

15.3

Third Step: From Sides to Edges

The boundary ∂s of each side s = (e1 , . . . , en ) is composed of edges e. Conversely, each
edge e = (s1 , . . . , s Ne ) is part of the boundary of Ne different sides, which we label in
sequential order si ≡ (ci ci+1 ) for i ∈ {1, . . . , Ne }, with the convention that c Ne +1 is the
same as c1 after encircling the edge e once. Note that this sequence of sides is dual to
a loop of links si∗ = (ci ci+1 )∗ around the edge e. Then we can rearrange the integrals
as follows:
ˆ

Ici ci+1 ≡ (1 − λ) ∆hcii+1 · [xci , dxci ] + λxcii+1 · ((1 − µ) [xci , d∆hci ] − µ [dxci , ∆hci ]) .
(15.21)
We would like to perform a final integration using Stokes’ theorem. For this we again
need to somehow cancel some elements, as we did before. However, since there are
now Ne different contributions, we cannot use the continuity conditions between each
pair of adjacent cells, since in order to get cancellations, all terms must have the same
base point (subscript).
One option is to choose a particular cell and trace everything back to that cell. However, this forces us to choose a specific cell for each edge. A more symmetric solution
involves splitting each holonomy hci ci+1 , which goes from from ci∗ to ci∗+1 , into two
holonomies – first going from ci∗ to (some arbitrary point e0 on) e and then back to
ci∗+1 , using the recipe given in Section 2.6:
hci ci+1 = hci e heci+1 ,
From this we find that

c

xcii+1 = xeci ⊕ xei+1 = xeci + hci e xei+1 heci = hci e xei+1 − xei heci .

∆hcii+1 = hci e ∆hei+1 − ∆hei heci .

Therefore


c
+ λhci e xei+1 − xcei heci · ((1 − µ) [xci , d∆hci ] − µ [dxci , ∆hci ]) .

Furthermore, we have the usual continuity conditions between a cell ci and the edge
e:
c
xci = hci e xe − xei heci ,
dxci = hci e dxe heci ,
(15.24)

c
h ci = h ci e h e ,
∆hci = hci e ∆he − ∆hei heci ,
d∆hci = hci e d∆he heci .
(15.25)
134

If we had a cylinder around the edge e, then these conditions would have been valid
on the boundary between the cylinder and the cell. However, in the case we are considering here, the cylinder has zero radius, so these conditions are instead valid on the
edge e itself.
Plugging in, we get

135

Now, c Ne +1 is the same as c1 after encircling e once. So, if the geometry is completely
flat and torsionless, we can just say that Θe vanishes. However, if the edge carries
curvature and/or torsion, then after winding around the edge once, the rotational
and translational holonomies should detect them. This is illustrated in Figure 11. We
choose to label this as follows:
c

∆he Ne +1 − ∆hce1 ≡ δMe ,

c

xe Ne +1 − xce1 ≡ Se .

(15.27)

The values of Me and Se in (15.27) are directly related53 to the values of pe and je in
(14.4), which determine the momentum and angular momentum of the string that lies
on the edge e. We may interpret (15.27) in two ways. Either we first find Me and Se by
calculating the difference of holonomies, as defined in (15.27), and then define pe and
je in (14.4) as functions of these quantities – or, conversely, we start with strings that
have well-defined momentum and angular momentum pe and je , and then define Me
and Se as appropriate functions of pe and je .
53 To find the exact relation, we should regularize the edges using cylinders, just as we regularized the

vertices using disks in the 2+1D case, which then allowed us to find a relation between the holonomies
and the mass and spin of the particles. We leave this calculation for future work.

136

Figure 11: Three cells (tetrahedrons, in red) dual to three nodes (in black).
The cells share three faces (highlighted) which are dual to three oriented
links (blue arrows) connecting the nodes. The three links form a loop,
which goes around the single edge shared by all three cells (the thick black
arrow in the middle). By taking a holonomy around the loop (c1 c2 c3 c1 ), we
can detect the curvature and torsion encoded in the middle edge.
Unfortunately, aside from this simplification, it does not seem possible to simplify Θe
any further, since there is no obvious way to write the integrands as exact 1-forms.

137

The only thing left for us to do, therefore, is to call the integrals by names54 :
ˆ
ˆ
ˆ
2
1
∆He ≡ [dxe , ∆he ] ,
∆He ≡ [xe , d∆he ] ,
Xe ≡ [xe , dxe ] ,
and write:

(15.28)

e

e

e



Θe = (1 − λ) Xe · δMe + λSe · (1 − µ) ∆He1 − µ∆He2 .

(15.29)

In fact, since both He1 and He2 are conjugate to the same variable Se , we might as well
collect them into a single variable:
∆He ≡ (1 − µ) ∆He1 − µ∆He2 ,

(15.30)

so that the choice of parameter µ ∈ [0, 1] simply chooses how much of He1 compared
to He2 is used this variable. We obtain:
Θe = (1 − λ) Xe · δMe + λSe · ∆He .

(15.31)

This term is remarkably similar to the vertex potential we found in the second line of
(11.33) in the analysis of corner modes in 2+1D. Indeed, the derivation here is very
much analogous to the derivation of Chapter 11. This term encodes the dynamics of
the curvature and torsion on each edge e. In fact, if we perform a change of variables:

(1 − λ ) X e 7 → X e ,

λSe 7→ − (Se + [Me , Xe ]) ,

(15.32)

we obtain precisely the same term that we obtained in (8.35):
Θe = Xe · δMe − (Se + [Me , Xe ]) · ∆He .

definitions of ∆He , ∆He1 , and ∆He2 , which are 1-forms on field space, define the holonomies He , He1 and

15.6

Holonomies and Fluxes

Finally, in order to relate this to the spin network phase space, as we did in the 2+1D
case, we need to identify holonomies and fluxes. From the 2+1D case, we know
that the fluxes are in fact also holonomies – but they are translational, not rotational,
holonomies. hci ci+1 is by definition the rotational holonomy on the link (ci ci+1 )∗ , and
c
xcii+1 is is by definition the translational holonomy on the link (ci ci+1 )∗ , so it’s natural
to simply define
c
c
(15.42)
Xcii+1 ≡ xcii+1 .
Hci ci+1 ≡ hci ci+1 ,
We should also define holonomies and fluxes on the sides dual to the links. By inspection, the flux on the side (ci ci+1 ) must be
h
i
c i +1
v
v0
(15.43)
X̃ci ≡ xci , hci v xv hvci .
Note that this expression depends only on the source cell ci and not on the target cell
ci+1 , just as the analogous flux in the 2+1D case only depended on the source cell.
This is an artifact of using the continuity conditions to write everything in terms of the
source cell in order to make the expression integrable (and this is why we symmetrized
the potential in Chapter (11) – the same can be done here, of course). The first term in
the commutator is xvci , the translational holonomy from the node ci∗ to the vertex v, the
0
starting point of e. The second term contains xvv , the translational holonomy along the
edge e.
As for holonomies on the sides – again, since we initially had two ways to integrate,
we also have two different ways to define holonomies. However, as above, since both
c
holonomies are conjugate to the same flux, Xcii+1 , there is really no reason to differentiate them. Therefore we just define implicitly:
i

c i +1

v
(15.44)
∆ H̃ci ≡ (1 − µ) xci , hci v ∆hv hvci + µ hci v xv hvci , ∆hci ,
and the choice of parameter µ ∈ [0, 1] simply determines how much of this holonomy
comes from each polarization. We finally get:
c c i +1

Θei

c

c

c

c

= (1 − λ) X̃cii+1 · ∆Hcii+1 + λXcii+1 · ∆ H̃cii+1 .

(15.45)

This is exactly56 the same term we obtained in the 2+1D case, (11.44)! It represents a
holonomy-flux phase space on each link. For λ = 0 the holonomies are on links and
the fluxes are on their dual sides, while for the dual polarization λ = 1 the fluxes are
on the links and the holonomies are on the sides, in analogy with the two polarization
we found in the 2+1D case.
56 Aside

from the relative sign, which comes from the fact that in the beginning we were writing a
3-form instead of a 2-form as an exact form, and plays no role here since each term describes a separate
phase space.

Conclusions
Summary of Our Results

In this thesis, we performed a rigorous piecewise-flat-and-torsionless discretization of
classical general relativity in the first-order formulation, in both 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions, carefully keeping track of curvature and torsion via holonomies. We showed
that the resulting phase space is precisely that of spin networks, the quantum states of
discrete spacetime in loop quantum gravity, with additional degrees of freedom called
edge modes, which result from the discretization itself and possess their own unique
symmetries.

,

The main contributions of this work are as follows.
1. It establishes, for the first time, a rigorous proof of the equivalence between
spin networks and piecewise-flat geometries with curvature and torsion degrees of
freedom.
In the 2+1-dimensional case, each node of the spin network is dual to a 2dimensional cell, and each link connecting two nodes is dual to the edge
shared by the two corresponding cells. A loop of links (or a face) is dual
to a vertex of the cellular decomposition. These vertices are the locations
where point particles reside, and by examining the value of the holonomies
along the loop dual to a vertex, we learn about the curvature and torsion
induced by the particle at the vertex by virtue of the Einstein equation.
In the 3+1-dimensional case, the situation is quite similar. Each node of
the spin network is dual to a 3-dimensional cell, and each link connecting
two nodes is dual to the side shared by the two corresponding cells. A
loop of links (or a face) is dual to an edge of the cellular decomposition.
These edges are the locations where strings reside, and by examining the
value of the holonomies along the loop dual to an edge, we learn about
the curvature and torsion induced by the string at the edge by virtue of the
Einstein equation.
Equivalently, if we assume that the only way to detect curvature and torsion is by looking at appropriate holonomies on the loops of the spin networks, then we may interpret our result as taking some arbitrary continuous geometry, not necessarily generated by particles or strings, truncating it, and encoding it on the vertices in 2+1D or edges in 3+1D. The
holonomies cannot tell the difference between a continuous geometry and
a singular geometry; they can only tell us about the total curvature and
torsion inside the loop.
As the spin networks are the quantum states of space and geometry is loop
quantum gravity, our results illustrate a precise way in which these states
can be assigned classical spatial geometries.
2. It demonstrates that careful consideration of edge modes is crucial both for the
purpose of this proof and for future work in the field of loop quantum gravity.
Indeed, in Chapter 10 we analyzed the symmetries generated by the constraints and found that the entire symplectic form, not just the spin network terms but also the edge mode (or particle) term – which depends
on the extra degrees of freedom hv (v) and xv (v) and the curvature and
torsion encoded in the variables Mv and Sv – is invariant under this transformation.
Furthermore, in Section 8.4 we saw that the edge mode term transforms in
a well-defined way under both right translations, corresponding to gauge
142

transformations, and left translations, corresponding to an additional symmetry which did not exist in the continuous theory.
One could choose a particular gauge where the edge modes are “frozen”,
that is, hv (v) = 1 and xv (v) = 0. In this case, the entire particle term
vanishes (in the limit where the disks are shrunk, v0 → v). Freezing the
edge modes makes exactly as much sense as any other gauge-fixing: it is
convenient, but completely masks an important symmetry of our theory.
3. It set the stage for collaboration between the loop quantum gravity community
and theoretical physicists working on edge modes from other perspectives, such as
quantum electrodynamics, non-abelian gauge theories, and classical gravity.
This is especially important because loop quantum gravity has always been
considered somewhat of a “fringe” theory. The study of edge modes has
become increasingly popular in recent years among physicists who work
on more “mainstream” theories, and interaction between the loop quantum
gravity community and the physicists working on edge modes would no
doubt be mutually beneficial for both communities.
4. It further developed the idea, introduced in [17] and later expanded in [58], that
spin networks have a dual description related to teleparallel gravity, where gravity
is encoded in torsion instead of curvature degrees of freedom.
In fact, we found a whole spectrum of theories for λ ∈ [0, 1], with the cases
λ = 0 (usual loop gravity), λ = 1 (dual/teleparallel loop gravity), and
possibly λ = 1/2 (Chern-Simons theory) being of particular importance.
We also analyzed the discrete constraints in detail in both polarizations.
Importantly, we have discovered that this duality exists in both 2+1 and
3+1 dimensions, although we did not study it in detail in the latter case.
The existence of this dual formulation of loop gravity may open up new
avenues of research that have so far been unexplored, and new ways to
tackle long-standing open problems in loop quantum gravity.

Future Plans

In this thesis we presented a very detailed analysis of the 2+1-dimensional toy model,
which is, of course, simpler than the realistic 3+1-dimensional case. This analysis was
performed with the philosophy that the 2+1D toy model can provide deep insights
about the 3+1D theory.
Indeed, as we have seen in Parts III and IV, many structures from the 2+1D case, such
as the cellular decomposition and its relation to the spin network, the rotational and
translational holonomies and their properties, and the singular matter sources, can be
readily generalized to the 3+1D with minimal modifications. Thus, the results of Parts
143

I and II should be readily generalizable as well. As we have seen, we indeed obtain
the same symplectic potential in both cases, which is not surprising – since we used
the same structures in both.
However, the 3+1-dimensional case presents many challenges which would require
much more work, far beyond the scope of this thesis, to overcome. Here we present
some suggestions for possible research directions in 3+1D. Note that there are also
many things one could explore in the 2+1D case, but we choose to focus on 3+1D
since it is the physically relevant case. Of course, in many cases it would be beneficial
to try introducing new structures (e.g. a cosmological constant) in the 2+1D case first,
since the lessons learned from the toy theory may then be employed in the realistic
theory – as we, indeed, did in this thesis.
1. Proper treatment of the singularities
In the 2+1D case, we carefully treated the 0-dimensional singularities, the
point particles, by regularizing them with disks. This introduced many
complications, but also ensured that our results were completely rigorous.
In the 3+1D case, we skipped this crucial part, and instead jumped right to
the end by assuming the results we had in 2+1D apply to the 3+1D case as
well.
It would be instructive to repeat this in 3+1D and carefully treat the 1dimensional singularities, the cosmic strings, by regularizing them with
cylinders. Of course, this calculation will be much more involved than the
one we did in 2+1D, as we now have to worry not only about the boundary of the disk but about the various boundaries of the cylinder. In particular, we must also regularize the vertices by spheres such that the top
and bottom of each cylinder start on the surface of a sphere; this is further
necessary in order to understand what happens at the points where several
strings meet.
In attempts to perform this calculation, we encountered many mathematical and conceptual difficulties, which proved to be impossible to overcome
within the scope of this thesis. Therefore, we leave it to future work.
2. Proper treatment of the edge modes
In the 2+1D case we analyzed the edge modes in detail, in particular by
studying their role in the symplectic potential in both the continuous and
discrete cases. However, in the 3+1D case we again skipped this and instead assumed our results from 2+1D still hold. In future work, we plan to
perform a rigorous study of the edge modes in 3+1D, including their role
in the symplectic potential and the new symmetries they generate.
3. Introducing a cosmological constant

144

In this thesis, we greatly simplified the calculation in 3+1 dimensions by
imposing that the geometry inside the cells is flat, mimicking the 2+1dimensional case. A more complicated case, but still probably doable within
our framework, is incorporating a cosmological constant, which will then
impose that the cells are homogeneously curved rather than flat. In this
case, it would be instructive to perform the calculation in the 2+1D toy
model first, and then generalize it to 3+1D.
4. Including point particles
Cosmic strings in 3+1D have a very similar mathematical structure to point
particles in 2+1D (compare Chapters 5 and 13). For this reason, we used
string-like defects as our sources of curvature and torsion in 3+1D, which
then allowed us to generalize our results from 2+1D in a straightforward
way. An important, but extremely complicated, modification would be to
allow point particles in 3+1D as well.
More precisely, in 2+1D, we added sources for the curvature and torsion
constraints, which are 2-forms. This is equivalent to adding matter sources
on the right-hand side of the Einstein equation. Since these distributional
sources are 2-form delta functions on a 2-dimensional spatial slice, they
pick out 0-dimensional points, which we interpreted as a particle-like defects.
In 3+1D, we again added sources for the curvature and torsion, which in
this case are not constraints, but rather imposed by hand to vanish. Since
these distributional sources are 2-form delta functions on a 3-dimensional
spatial slice, they pick out 1-dimensional strings. What we should actually do is add sources for the three constraints – Gauss, vector, and scalar
– which are 3-forms. The 3-form delta functions will then pick out 0dimensional points.
However, doing this would introduce several difficulties, both mathematical and conceptual. Perhaps the most serious problem would be that in 3
dimensions, once cannot place a vertex inside a loop. Indeed, in 2 dimensions, a loop encircling a vertex cannot be shrunk to a point, as it would
have to pass through the vertex. Similarly, in 3 dimensions, a loop encircling an edge cannot be shrunk to a point without passing through the
edge. Therefore, in these cases it makes sense to say that the vertex or edge
is inside the loop.
However, in 3 dimensions there is no well-defined way in which a vertex can be said to be inside a loop; any loop can always be shrunk to a
point without passing through any particular vertex. Hence, it is unclear
how holonomies on the loops of the spin network would be able to detect
the curvature induced by a point particle at a vertex. Solving this prob145

lem might require generalizing the concept of spin networks to allow for
higher-dimensional versions of holonomies.
5. Taking Lorentz boosts into account
In 2+1D, we split spacetime into 2-dimensional slices of equal time, but we
left the internal space 2+1-dimensional. The internal symmetry group was
then the full Lorentz group. However, in 3+1D, we not only split spacetime
into 3-dimensional slices of equal time, we did the same to the internal
space as well, and imposed the time gauge e0a = 0. The internal symmetry
group thus reduced from the Lorentz group to the rotation group.
Although this 3+1 split of the internal space is standard in 3+1D canonical loop gravity, one may still wonder what happened to the boosts, and
whether we might be missing something important by assuming that the
variables on each cell are related to those on other cells only by rotations,
and not by a full Lorentz transformation. This analysis might prove crucial
for capturing the full theory of gravity in 3+1D in our formalism, and in
particular, for considering forms of matter other than cosmic strings.
6. Motivating a relation to teleparallel gravity
In both 2+1D and 3+1D, we found that the discrete phase space carries two
different polarizations. In 2+1D, we motivated an interpretation where
one polarization corresponds to usual general relativity and the other to
teleparallel gravity, an equivalent theory where gravity is encoded in torsion instead of curvature degrees of freedom. In the future we plan to
motivate a similar relation between the two polarizations in 3+1D.
7. Analyzing the discrete constraints
In 2+1D, we provided a detailed analysis of the discrete Gauss and curvature constraints, and the symmetries that they generate. We would like
to provide a similar analysis of the discrete Gauss, vector, and scalar constraints in the 3+1D case. This will allow us to better understand the discrete structure we have found, and in particular, its relation to edge modes
symmetries.
