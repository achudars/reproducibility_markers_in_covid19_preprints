Abstract—We develop a method for the automated detection
and segmentation of speech balloons in comic books, including
their carrier and tails. Our method is based on a deep
convolutional neural network that was trained on annotated
pages of the Graphic Narrative Corpus. More precisely, we are
using a fully convolutional network approach inspired by the
U-Net architecture, combined with a VGG-16 based encoder.
The trained model delivers state-of-the-art performance with
an F1-score of over 0.94. Qualitative results suggest that wiggly
tails, curved corners, and even illusory contours do not pose
a major problem. Furthermore, the model has learned to
distinguish speech balloons from captions. We compare our
model to earlier results and discuss some possible applications.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Comic books are an under-analyzed cultural resource that
combine visual elements with textual components. Despite the
common assumption that the target audience of comic books
are children, their topics and story line are often elaborate,
addressing a mature audience. The label “graphic novel”
has been created to better market comic books targeting
adult readers. Comics are visual narratives with a sequential
structure, and their comprehension requires a specific visual
literacy from the reader. The structure of visual narratives is
complex, and can be divided into modality, grammar, and
meaning, each of which can be described at the level of the
individual unit as well as of a sequence [8]. Most of the work
from the document analysis perspective to date has focused
on the graphic and morphological structure, and hence on
the individual unit level in that scheme.
As comic book pages are complex documents, the analysis,
detection and segmentation of their constituent parts is
an interesting problem for automated document analysis.
Typically a comic book consists of pages divided into
panels according to a variety of layout schemes. Panels
in turn contain pictorial content as well as several types
of text containers such as captions and speech balloons,
which usually differ in function. Panels may also contain
onomatopoeia and diegetic text. The individual elements
just mentioned can also be distributed across several panels

or bleed into the void between panels called the “gutter”.
Recent overviews of comics research can be found in Cohn
[7], Augereau et al. [3], and Dunst et al. [12]. Here we
focus on one particular element of graphic structure, namely,
speech balloons. Most of the text in comics is located in
speech balloons and captions, thus locating these elements is
a prerequisite for OCR. However, it also pays to classify these
as different classes, because they serve different functions: In
contrast to captions, which are are normally used for narrative
purposes, speech balloons typically contain direct speech or
thoughts of characters in the comic. Speech balloons usually
consist of a carrier, “a symbolic device used to hold the
text” (Cohn, 2013b), and a tail connecting the carrier to its
root character from which the text emerges. Both tails and
carriers come in a variety of shapes, outlines, and degrees
of wiggliness. Here we describe a method for the automated
detection and segmentation of speech balloons of various
forms and shapes, including their tails.
Our method is based on a fully convolutional network [34],
specifically on a modified U-Net architecture [33] in combination with a pre-trained VGG-16 encoder [35]. We are
thus using an encoder that was trained for classification of
natural images, and an architecture which was originally
developed for medical image segmentation. By showing that
this combination achieves state-of-the art performance with
illustrations, we also suggest that transfer might generalize
to more or less related tasks. Automated detection of speech
balloons and other typical elements of comic books is not
only desirable for research purposes such as creating and
analyzing larger datasets of annotated comic books, or as a
first step in an optical character recognition (OCR) pipeline,
but also has potential for applications such as preparing
digitized comics for computerized presentation on handheld
devices, or developing assistive technologies for people with
low vision.
A. Related work
Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs)
using learned feature hierarchies have been shown to perform
better in many visual recognition and localization tasks than
other algorithms that use carefully crafted engineered features.
However, partly due to the lack of big corpora there are only
very few publications tackling the task of analyzing comic

CNN-BASED SPEECH BALLOON SEGMENTATION FOR COMICS- F EBRUARY 22, 2019
books using deep neural networks. We will describe some of
this recent work on DCNN-based object detection in comics
below, but first summarize some of the older work based on
engineered features, focusing on speech balloon detection.
Arai and Tolle [2] were the first to attempt speech
balloon detection. They limited themselves to simple layouts
without overlap or bleeding, i.e., all balloons are fully
contained within the panels. They first extracted panels using
a connected-components approach. Some morphological
operations are then applied to panels, followed by another
connected component run, from which candidates are selected
using some heuristics such as white pixel ratio or size
and height relative to the panel dimensions. Some of these
heuristics assume vertical text, so the applicability is limited
to Manga.
Ho et al. [16] use a similar approach, but start by
identifying candidate regions through their (white) color. Next
they apply some size and shape criteria, then use connected
components to locate text within the balloon, followed by a
morphological dilatation operation, and another size threshold.
The result is a bounding box of the text. Again, this approach
only works with simple balloons.
Rigaud et al. [32], realizing the great variety and heterogeneity of balloons in the wild, which are often defined
by irregular shapes or even illusory contours, developed a
decidedly different approach based on active contours [20].
Following edge detection by a Sobel operator, and text
detection (and removal) as an important initialization step,
Rigaud et al. [32] introduce new energy terms for the active
contour model based on domain knowledge, such as strong
edges, smooth contours, and the relative location of text. This
is the first proposal that can delineate the full shape of a
speech balloon and handle illusory or subjective contours.
Whereas this method requires the location of text, Rigaud
et al. [31] propose a method in which speech balloons are
located first, and text is only used to give a confidence rating
on whether a candidate region is indeed a speech balloon.
This method first uses an adaptive binarization threshold,
following by a connected components approach to identify
(a) speech balloon candidates and (b) text within speech
balloons. Some criteria on typical alignment and centering of
text within a balloon are used to arrive at a confidence score.
One drawback of this method in comparison to Rigaud et al.
[32] is that it only appears to work with closed balloons.
Let us now turn to DCNN approaches. Since we know
of only one attempt at speech balloon segementation proper,
we extend the scope a little. The general aim is to show that
features which are typically learned on photographs of natural
scenes can nevertheless be used to describe illustrations such
as comics. More specific applications in object detection and
segmentation are included.
Chu and Li [6] used deep neural networks for face detection in Manga. Rigaud and colleagues, who had previously
used several methods with hand crafted features to detect

elements of comic book pages (see above), have switched
to convolutional neural network features in more recent
work [27, 28]. Nguyen et al. [28] describe a multi-task
learning model for comic book image analysis derived from
on Mask R-CNN [14] that defines the current state-of-the-art
in detection and segmentation of several object categories
such as panels, characters, and speech balloons. Ogawa et al.
[29] used convolutional neural network features for object
detection on the annotated Manga109 corpus.
Iyyer et al. [19] attempted to model a striking sequential
aspect of comics, namely the inference required from the
reader to bridge the gutter, i.e., to make sense of panel transitions and coherently integrate them into the mental model of
the text. The multilevel hierarchical LSTM architecture they
used to model sequential dependencies in text and image
semantics is beyond the scope of the present paper, but
in passing they provided an annotated dataset of comics
in the public domain from the “Golden Age of Comics”.
Specifically, they (a) annotated 500 randomly selected pages
for training a Faster R-CNN [30] to segment pages into
about 1.2 million panels. Furthermore, they (b) annotated
1500 panels for textboxes for training another Faster R-CNN
combined with ImageNet-pretrained VGG feature encoding
to segment 2.5 million textboxes, and (c) extract text from
these textboxes using Google’s Cloud Vision OCR. This is
certainly a data set that deserves further exploration. For the
current purposes, the main problem is that text elements are
annotated using rectangular bounding boxes, and without
differentiating between captions and speech balloons. Thus
segmentations based on these annotations lack detail and
specificity. Generally, however, their results definitely show
that pretrained features obtained from training on ImageNet
can very well be re-used for comics document image analysis
tasks.
Laubrock and Dubray [23] have similarly shown that
deep convolutional neural networks are well-suited to capture
graphical aspects of comics books and can successfully be
used in categorizing illustrator style, pacing the way for a
visual stylometry. Laubrock et al. [24] show that eye-tracking
data obtained from comics readers as a measure of visual
attention and CNN predictions of empirical saliency based on
Deep Gaze II [22] tend to focus on similar regions of comics
pages. Regions containing text such as speech balloons or
captions are focused most often. For the image part, empirical
attention allocation appears to be object-based, with regions
containing faces receiving a high proportion of fixations.
B. The present approach
Building on these earlier successes, here we use a deep
neural network to learn speech balloon localization and
segmentation of annotated pages from the Graphic Narrative
Corpus [11]. We regarded speech balloon detection as a semantic segmentation problem, i.e., a pixel-wise classification
task. By partitioning a scanned image into coherent parts
2

CNN-BASED SPEECH BALLOON SEGMENTATION FOR COMICS- F EBRUARY 22, 2019
we aimed to classify for each pixel whether it belongs to
a speech balloon or not. We chose a fully convolutional
encoder-decoder architecture based on U-Net [33], i.e., there
are no densely connected layers in the model. The network
can be divided into an encoding and a decoding branch,
devoted to describing the image using a pre-trained network
and semantically-guided re-mapping back to input space,
respectively. The encoding branch uses a standard VGG16 model [35] pre-trained on ImageNet [9] that employs
several hierarchical convolutional and max-pooling layers
to extract features useful in describing the stimulus. It
therefore encodes the image into more and more abstract
representations guided by semantics. The higher the encoding
level, the less fine-grained the spatial resolution and the more
condensed the semantic information. We have previously
shown that re-using weights obtained from pre-training for an
object recognition task transfers well to graphic novels [23].
We chose VGG for encoding because of the conceptual
simplicity of its architecture that allows for easy upscaling,
but note that other architectures that outperform VGG in
image classification (such as Xception, [5]) can in principle
be plugged in.
The decoding branch of the network performs upsampling
and is trained to do the segmentation. The decoder thus
semantically projects discriminative features learnt by the
encoder onto the pixel space of the input image in order
to get a dense classification. Intermediate representations
from the encoding branch are copied to and combined with
the decoding activations to achieve better localization and
learning of features in the upsampling branch.

The encoding branch uses the convolutional part of the
VGG-16 model. Each image is downsampled subsequently to
five encoding representations, each halving the spatial height
and width of the previous representation. This is simply
achieved by using the output of the five convolutional blocks
of the VGG-16 model (Figure 1, left side).
The decoding branch decodes up to the original resolution.
Each of the five upsampling steps (Figure 1, right side)
doubles the width and height of an encoding representation.
Upsampling is performed by transposed convolutions. At
each upsampling step, skip connections are used, meaning
that copies of the encoding representation corresponding
to the resulting width and height are additionally included
by concatenation. A convolutional operation was performed
on the concatenated representation. A sigmoid activation
function as the last step of decoding results in a 768 ×
512 representation of floating values in (0,1), which can be
considered to give the probability of each pixel to belong
to a speech balloon. The decoder thus outputs a pixel-based
prediction about the location of the speech balloons, which
was compared to binary mask images of our annotated speech
balloons.
In addition to the standard U-Net architecture, in the
upscaling branch, we used L2 kernel-regularization (see
results for parameters) and standard batch normalization [18]
after the last activation function of each upsampling step.
We implemented the model using keras [4].

Our training material contains roughly 750 annotated

English-language graphic novels with a variety of styles.
Parts of the GNC are annotated by human annotators
with respect to several constituent parts such as panels,
captions, onomatopoeia, or speech balloons. The material
includes some non-standard examples of balloons (e.g.,
speech balloons outside of the panel or balloons looking
like captions) but mainly consists of typical balloons from a
large variety of 90 comic books.
Binary mask images were generated from ground truth
corpus annotations of speech balloons, which are represented
by lists of polygon vertices in an XML format. For the
balloon segmentation task, we downscaled the corpus images

D. Training and augmentation
We split our dataset into a training and validation set with
the ratios 0.85 and 0.15 on the total set, respectively. This
split was done randomly with a stratifying condition ensuring
to split each of the included comics books with this ratio
(some comic books were pooled due to the low amount
of annotated images). First, all image values were linearly
normalized to the interval [0,1]. Then, on the training set
we applied image augmentation randomly using rotation of
the hue channel of the HSV image (range 0 to 0.3), height
and widths shifts (range: 0.2 of each dimension size) and
flipping the image horizontally and vertically. We trained
the model using an Adam optimizer (learning rate of 0.001,

B. Model architecture
We used a fully convolutional approach predicting a pixelbased image segmentation. The network is based on the
U-Net architecture and can be divided into an encoding and
a decoding branch (see Figure 1).

each epoch going through the full training set. In order to
fight overfitting, weight decay (L2 regularization) with a
parameter of λ = 0.001 was added to the final convolutional
layer of each decoding block, which had an effect similar to
dropout.

the values by computing the median of the metrics on the

GNC) for the eBDtheque corpus. Table II lists the values for
recall, precision, and F1 score (we used the average over five
different runs on different test sets). Note that we did not
use the eBDtheque material for training, whereas the other
models did. Therefore, in order to better describe our model
performance, we additionally present results obtained for our
own test set of pages from the GNC that were excluded from
training (Table II, last row).

failure to capture these extreme examples is due to a
relative lack of diversity of our training set. To get a more
representative measure of the performance, we therefore
additionally included the median per measure over images.
In summary, our model outperforms previous approaches in
recall and F1 , and is at least competitive in precision.

Our model generally transfers quite well to the new data
set. One problem is that eBDtheque annotations do not
distinguish between speech balloon and caption, whereas
our model has learned to distinguish between them. We
thus manually added this distinction to the ground truth.
Another problem for our model is the inclusion of a few
Manga images with Japanese script in the eBDtheque. We had
previously observed that our model currently fails miserably
to predict speech balloons in the Manga109 data set [26].
Whereas we can currently only speculate that this may be
due to the some sort of basic alphabetic character recognition
and/or vertical orientation of the speech balloons, it gave
us an a priori reason to exclude the 6 manga images from
evaluation, which boosted the score quite a bit. Finally, we
observed that out model did very well on the vast majority
of images, but performed poorly on a few images with rather
untypical speech balloons (like the very abstracted balloons
in TRONDHEIM_LES_TROIS_CHEMINS__00x.jpg). The

Figures 2-5 show some qualitative results, with colours
indicating confidence of speech balloon classification (values
according to matplotlib’s [17] colormap hot, with black: 0,
white: 1). Figures 2 and 3 are from the training set, whereas
the remaining Figures are from the test set. Figure 2 illustrates
that the model can (a) well approximate curved tails, and
(b) has learned to differentiate between speech balloons and
other regions containing text. Figure 3 demonstrates that the
model can approximates illusory contours, i.e., boundaries
of speech balloons that are not defined by physical lines,
but just by imaginary continuoations of the gutter lines in
this case. Classification confidence drops near those illusory
contours. Figure 4 shows that good performance is also
achieved on test set images. Figure 5 (upper part) illustrates
that sometimes illusory contours are hard to detect for the
model. Furthermore, a false alarm in the lower part of the
figure is probably triggered by a shape that looks similar to
a tail of a speech balloon.

direction of the tail, the shape of the outline, or even the
approximate end of speech bubbles that were partly defined
by illusory contours (Kanizsa, 1976).
Whereas the overall performance is impressive, inspection
of misclassification cases is instructive. Most of these appear
to be solveable by some heuristic post-processing using
methods similar to those described in I-A. Additionally, a
relatively high confidence threshold would help reduce the
number of false alarms. For example, sometimes the model is
weakly confident about having detected a balloon in a bright
area that has a boundary akin to a circular arc. However,
the confidence for these regions is usually lower than for
real balloons, and the detected area is also significantly
smaller. Thus, some thresholding on confidence as well as
size might be helpful for production use, even though less
desirable in terms of using a unified approach. Another
class of misclassification is misses (omissions); inspection
of these suggest that they were often ballons with very large
fonts, and sometimes jagged boundaries. Since very large
typeface is otherwise mostly used for onomatopeia, we think
it is possible that the model has learned that large fonts are
usually associated with something else than speech balloons.
One limitation of the current model is related to the
training material. In testing transfer to new data sets we
observed that whereas predictions for the eBDtheque data
set were qualitatively good, the model in its current form
failed quite miserably on the Manga109 data set [26, 29].
We speculate that the model currently encodes some culturespecific features such as letter identities of the latin alphabet,
the horizontal orientation of text lines, or the horizontally
elongated shape of most speech balloons in our training
material. An updated version that includes more Manga
training material is under development.
Our original aim for successful detection was to integrate
the semi-automated speech balloon detection in our in-house
annotation tool (Dunst et al., 2017). Even though prediction
times are pretty fast, they will introduce a noticeable delay in
page loading, thus a batch mode is planned. Regions that are
predicted to be speech balloons will be represented by their
polygonal outline, which can then be accepted or corrected
by the annotator. Alternatively, means of optimizing the run
time per image will be explored.
Another obvious for future research is to extend the model
to allow segmentation of different classes, such as captions,
onomatopoeia, and even characters. The general success of
segmentation model in multiclass labeling as well as the
specific results reported by Nguyen et al. (2019) in their
multitask model suggest that this will be quite feasible. A
more general use of this kind of algorithm (using different
training data) would be any segmentation task using realworld features. For example, we expect that the present
approach may generalize to other segmentation tasks such
as segmenting historical manuscripts into text and image,
scientific articles into text, figures and tables, segmenting

newspaper articles into paragraphs and images, or segmenting
medical scans according to presence or absence of a disease.
Of course, human-assisted verification is needed, but given
the fact there are now several computer vision domains where
the performance of CNN-based models is at least close to
human performance, we expect to be able to solve several
tedious annotation tasks, freeing human resources for more
interesting endeavours.
