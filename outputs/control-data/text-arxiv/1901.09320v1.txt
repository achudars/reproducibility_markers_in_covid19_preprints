ABSTRACT
Micro-nanoparticle systems have wide applications in thermal science and
technology. In dense particulate system, the particle separation distance may be less
than the characteristic thermal wavelength and near field effect will be significant and
become a key factor to influence thermal radiation transfer in the system. In this study,
radiative heat transfer (RHT) between two metallic nanoparticles clusters are explored
using many-body radiative heat transfer theory implemented with the coupled electric
and magnetic dipole (CEMD) approach, which effectively takes into account the
contribution of magnetic polarization of metallic nanoparticles on heat exchange. As
the focus, the effects of magnetic polarization and many-body interaction (MBI) on
RHT were analyzed. The effects of fractal dimension and relative orientation of the
clusters were also analyzed. Results show that the contribution of magnetically
polarized eddy-current Joule dissipation dominates the RHT between Ag nanoparticle
clusters. If only electric polarization (EP approach) is considered, the heat conductance
will be underestimated as compared with the CEMD approach in both near field and
far field regime. The effect of MBI on the RHT between Ag nanoparticle clusters is
unobvious at room temperature, which is quite different from the SiC nanoparticle
clusters. For the latter, MBI tends to suppress RHT significantly. The relative
orientation has remarkable effect on radiative heat flux for clusters with lacy structure
when the separation distance is in the near field. While for the separation distance in far
field, both the relative orientation and the fractal dimension has a weak influence on
radiative heat flux. This work will help the understanding of thermal transport in dense
particulate system.

I. INTRODUCTION
Due to rich physics and wide range of potential applications, particularly with the
advancement of micro-nano technologies, near field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT)
has received considerable attention in recent years. The fluctuational electrodynamics
theory developed by Rytov et al. [1] was well recognized as a theoretical framework to

predict NFRHT [2-8], which has been verified by many recent experimental
observations [9-17]. In dense particulate system, the particle separation distance may
be comparable to or less than the characteristic thermal wavelength, hence near field
effect will be significant and become the key factor to influence the thermal radiation
transfer characteristics.
Early studies on NFRHT mostly considered system consisting of two bodies, e.g.,
two plates, two particles, etc. Domingues et al. [18] investigated radiative thermal
conductance in near field by means of molecular dynamics coupled with fluctuation
dissipation theorem. Narayanaswamy et al. [19] studied the NFRHT between two
spherical particles of arbitrary radius based on rigorous solution of the fluctuational
electrodynamics theory with an quasi-analytical approach using vector spherical
harmonics expansion. Czapla et al. [20] extended the method developed by
Narayanaswamy et al. [19] to investigate NFRHT between two coated spheres with an
arbitrary numbers of coatings. Messina et al. [21-23] proposed a scattering operator
method to investigate NFRHT between two particles of arbitrary shape. Under dipole
approximation, Chapuis et al. [24] took into consideration the contribution of magneticmagnetic polarized eddy-current Joule dissipation (MM contribution) when
investigating RHT between two particles. They showed that the EE contribution
dominates the RHT between dielectric particles and the MM contribution dominates
the RHT between metallic particles. Manjavacas et al. [25] considered the contribution
of electromagnetic cross-terms, e.g. magnetic-electric polarized eddy-current Joule
dissipation contribution (ME contribution) and electric-magnetic polarized
displacement current dissipation (EM contribution) in calculating radiative heat flux
between two spherical particles. For dimers consisting of two dielectric particles or two
metallic particles, their research results were consistent with the work by Chapuis et al.
[24].
For NFRHT in system consisting of many particles, some important progresses
were reported only recently. There are very complex near field mutual interactions
among particles and the approach to deal with NFNHT in two-body system can not be
directly applied to the system of many particles. Ben-Abdallah et al. [26] developed a
many-body radiative heat transfer theory to investigate RHT in many particles system
and the effect MBI on RHT. Though the theory is based on dipole approximation, this
approach is very general and can be effectively applied to predict NFRHT in a system
of small particles of any shape, which allows detailed analysis of MBI in particulate
system. They showed that radiative heat flux between two SiC particles can be
enhanced significantly due to MBI after the insertion of a third particle [26]. The heat
super-diffusion behavior induced by MBI in networks of spherical particles was also
predicted [27]. It was also demonstrated that the spatial distribution of particles in a
system of particles plays a key role in determining radiative heat flux [28]. In contrast
to the enhancement effect of MBI on radiative heat flux observed in the system of three
SiC particles, it was also reported that MBI inhibits the radiative heat flux in dielectric
clusters of many particles [29].
Recently, there were some notable theoretical development to deal with NFRHT in

system of particles. Krüger et al. [30] proposed a trace formulas and applied it to
investigate RHT in many particles system composed of particles with arbitrary shape
and radius. Müller et al. [31] extended the trace formulas to the many particles system
embedded in a non-absorbing medium. Zhu et al. [32] investigated RHT in many
particles system without the constraint of reciprocity by means of the trace formulas.
Czapla et al. [33] derived formulas for NFRHT in a chain of spheres of arbitrary size,
spacing, and isotropic optical properties based on the theoretical frame developed by
Narayanaswamy et al. [19], which was validated by the thermal discrete dipole
approximation (T-DDA) [34] and fluctuating surface currents (FSC)/boundary element
methods (BEM) [35]. Becerril et al. [36] investigated near field energy transfer between
three nanoparticles system modulated by coupled multipolar modes and found that
coupled modes between nanoparticles provide more channels for NFRHT. By noticing
the many-body radiative heat transfer theories did not include the mutual interactions
of the electric and magnetic dipole moments and most of the studies considered
dielectric particles with magnetic dipole moment neglected, Dong et al. [37] developed
a coupled electric and magnetic dipole (CEMD) approach for the RHT in a collection
of objects in mutual interaction, as an extension of the work of Ben-Abdallah et al. [26].
The CEMD approach takes all the EE, EM, ME and MM contributions to RHT into
consideration, allows the analysis of NFRHT and the effect of MBI in system
containing groups of metallic particles, where the magnetic terms may play an
important role. Chen et al. [38] applied the CEMD approach to investigate RHT
between two assembled systems of core-shell nanoparticles and observed similar
inhibitive effect of MBI on total radiative heat flux as reported for dielectric particles
by Dong et al. [29]. Previous studies have shown that the effect of MBI on RHT is
complex in system of particles and significantly influences the radiative heat flux. It
remains unclear about the effect of MBI on the RHT characteristics in system of
metallic particles.
In this work, the RHT between two metallic nanoparticles clusters are explored
using many-body radiative heat transfer theory with the CEMD approach, which
effectively takes into account the contribution of magnetic response of metallic
nanoparticles on heat exchange. The effect of magnetic polarization and many-body
interaction on NFRHT in dense particulate system are analyzed as the focus. The effects
of fractal dimension and relative orientation of the clusters on NFRHT are also analyzed.
This work is organized as follows. In Section II, physical model of the fractal cluster
and theoretical aspects of the CEMD approach are presented. The formulas to evaluate
the effect of MBI on radiative heat exchange in two nanoparticles clusters are given. In
Section III, the mechanism of RHT between metallic nanoparticle clusters, the effects
of MBI, fractal dimension and relative orientation of clusters on RHT is analyzed.
II. MODEL AND METHOD
A. Nanoparticle cluster generation
RHT between two metallic nanoparticles clusters is considered. The nanoparticle
cluster is described by the following typical statistical rule [39]

 Rg 
N S  k0  
 a 

Df

(1)

where NS is the number of monomers in the cluster, Df is the fractal dimension, k0 is the
prefactor, a is the radius of the monomers and Rg is the radius of gyration. The Df is the
main factor that describes the compactness of the aggregate. Clusters with three
different Df (1.8, 2.3 and 2.8) are generated by the open source program provided by
Skorupski et al.[40], shown in Fig. 1(a)-(c). The number of realizations of clusters has
been checked. For more details about the cluster generation, please refer to the previous
work [29].The number of monomers in the aggregate (NS) is set as 400. RHT between
two identical absorbing and emitting clusters, of which temperatures are fixed at T and
T+T, is investigated. Separating gap (d) between clusters is defined as the distance
between the bottom of the upper cluster and the top of the lower cluster, shown in Fig.
1(d). Both d between clusters and separation distance between monomers inside cluster
edge to edge are larger than 2a, which makes dipole approximation valid [26, 37].

B. Polarizability of nanoparticle
In this work, Ag nanoparticle clusters are used for the calculations. SI unit system
is used for all the formulation. For isotropic spherical particles, the electric dipole
moment p and magnetic dipole moment m induced by the incident electromagnetic
field in the vacuum read

p   0 E Einc

(2)

m   H H inc

(3)

where  E and  H are electric and magnetic polarizability, Einc and Hinc=Binc/0 are the
incident electric and magnetic fields,  0 is the vacuum dielectric permittivity. The
electric and magnetic polarizabilities of a spherical Ag nanoparticle with radius of 5nm
are shown in Fig. 2. Neglecting the high order absorption and scattering,  E and  H can

be obtained from the first order Lorentz-Mie scattering coefficients as

where a1 and b1 are the first order Lorentz-Mie scattering coefficients. The nth order
Lorentz-Mie scattering coefficients are calculated from

where ω is angular frequency, ωp is 1.371016rad·s-1 and γ is 2.731013rad·s-1. Note that
the imaginary part of  E and  H are key factors in determining the exchanged
radiative power according to the transmission coefficients defined by Eqs. (25) and
(26). Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of metallic nanoparticle lies in the
optical frequency, as shown in Fig. 2(a), which can’t be excited thermally. Hence, RHT
between metallic nanoparticles can’t be as strong as the RHT between SiC dielectric
particles, which can support low frequency localized surface phonon resonance
(LSPhR). However, the magnetic response of the Ag nanoparticle is strong in the long
wavelength range located near the thermal wavelength, indicating significant
contribution of magnetic response to RHT in particulate system.

where symbol * denotes the conjugation of the corresponding complex vector. For
metallic nanoparticle, in addition to the electric contribution, the magnetic contribution
to the power dissipation will be significant and even become dominant. In this work,
the CEMD approach [37] is used to calculate RHT between metallic nanoparticle
clusters, which effectively takes the EE, EM, ME and MM contributions to RHT into
consideration and allows the analysis of NFRHT in system of metallic particles. In free

Then by omitting the MBI, the RHT power exchanged between two particles (P0ji), the
net exchanged RHT power between two clusters (0), and the thermal conductance
without MBI (G0) can be calculated using Eqs. (27), (28) and (29) with i0,j ( ) ,
respectively. Note that this definition of the RHT without MBI is consistent with the
previous definition by Dong et al. [29], which directly calculates RHT between two
particles.
The thermal conductance calculated considering only EE contribution GEE, namely,
only using the first term in transmission coefficient in Eq. (26), is the same as the
approach of the original many body radiative heat transfer theory [26], denoted as EP
approach in the following for comparison.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Radiative heat transfer between two Ag nanoparticles clusters is investigated at
various fractal dimensions (Df) and separating gaps (d). Thermal conductance is
calculated at 300K for all cases. The total thermal conductance is integrated over an
angular frequency range from 0.11014 rad·s-1 to 901014 rad·s-1. A proper frequency
resolution has been used to integrate spectral thermal conductance to obtain an accurate
thermal conductance using the composite Simpson numerical integration method.
A. RHT mechanism between metallic nanoparticle clusters
Thermal conductance between two Ag nanoparticles clusters as a function of
separating gap (d) is shown in Fig. 3. Both G and GEE are shown and the lines of 1/d6,
1/d4 and 1/d2 are added as reference. As shown, when d is small (less than 1m), thermal
conductance between two Ag nanoparticles clusters increases with the Df. While d is
large enough (larger than 1m), Df has little effect on the thermal conductance. When
d is small enough, thermal conductance between two Ag nanoparticles is even larger
than that of two Ag nanoparticles clusters. The reason to this phenomenon is that the
distance between nanoparticles in proximity has priority to the number of the emitting
and absorbing nanoparticles in determining the near-field thermal conductance. The
straight-line distance between the two nanoparticles is usually smaller than the closest
distance between two nanoparticles from the emitting and absorbing clusters, when the
Df is not too large. As the Df increases, the straight-line distance between the two
nanoparticles in proximity from the emitting and absorbing clusters approaches to that
of two nanoparticles, which results in that G between clusters is larger than that of two
nanoparticles. The number of particles in clusters begins to dominate the near-field

thermal conductance as Df of clusters increases to 2.3 and 2.8. Thermal conductance
between two nanoparticles decays as 1/d6 in near field for d less than 1m and decays
as 1/d2 in the far field. However, thermal conductance between two nanoparticles
clusters decays slower than 1/d4 in near field and decays as 1/d2 in the far field. This
may be attributed to the MBI in the nanoparticle clusters.

Fig. 3 Thermal conductance between two Ag nanoparticles clusters at various
fractal dimensions. Both CEMD approach and EP approach are used to calculate thermal
conductance.

For dielectric nanoparticle, radiative heat transfer is dominated by the electric
displacement current dissipation. While for metallic nanoparticle, eddy-current Joule
dissipation due to a changing magnetic field in the particle dominates the radiative heat
transfer. Thermal conductance obtained from the EP approach, considering only electric
polarization response, is also shown in Fig. 3. For both metallic nanoparticle clusters
and two metallic nanoparticles, EP approach underestimates the radiative heat transfer
as compare to the CEMD in both near field and far field.
To further explain the above observation on total thermal conductance, the spectral
Gdue to EE, EM, ME and MM contributions are presented in Fig. 4, where d is 1m
and Df is 2.8. For metallic nanoparticle clusters, MM contribution dominates the
thermal conductance. G due to EE contribution is far less than that of the MM
contribution, which results in the underestimation of RHT using the EP approach. The
peak of the Gdue to MM contribution locates at 100 m, which is consistent with the
peak of imaginary part of magnetic polarizability of metallic Ag as shown in Fig. 2(b).
However, the peaks of the Gdue to EE, ME and EM contributions all locate at 10m,
which is corresponding with the characteristic thermal wavelength at 300 K.

B. Effect of many-body interaction
Previous studies reported that MBI inhibits the RHT in dielectric particle clusters
[29, 38] though it enhances RHT in three SiC particle system [26]. It is still unclear
whether MBI inhibits or enhances RHT in metallic nanoparticle clusters. In this section,
MBI on RHT in metallic nanoparticle clusters is investigated. To evaluate the MBI on
RHT, a definition of the enhancement factor of RHT due to MBI is given as
E


0

(31)

where E is the enhancement factor, defined as the ratio of the net exchanged RHT power
between two nanoparticles clusters considering MBI with that calculated without
considering MBI. Both spectral E and total E can be easily calculated at a specified
angular frequency and the angular frequency range of interest. In order to understand
the MBI on RHT between metallic nanoparticle clusters, it is necessary to investigate
the simplest case (two nanoparticles system) at first. The Enhancement factor of
radiative thermal conductance between two Ag nanoparticles due to MBI is shown in
Fig. 5. For two nanoparticles separated by 0.01m, the spectral E in the infrared
frequency is nearly equal to 1, though in optical frequency range the E is bigger than 1,
which means that the MBI has little effect on the thermal radiative heat transfer between
two Ag nanoparticles. Increasing separation gap between Ag particles decreases the
enhancement in the optical frequency range due to MBI. From the point view of total

E, the MBI is unobvious for metallic nanoparticles, shown as the black line in Fig. 5(b).
For dielectric nanoparticles, MBI inhibits slightly the RHT in the near field, while in
the far field MBI has little effect on the RHT, shown as the red line in Fig. 5(b).

Fig. 5 Enhancement factor of radiative thermal conductance between two
Ag nanoparticles due to MBI: (a) spectral enhancement factor at
two different separating gaps; (b) total enhancement factor as a function of
separating gap, ranging from near field to far field.

The spectral enhancement factor between two Ag nanoparticles clusters at four
different separating gaps is shown in Fig. 6(a). The spectral E increases dramatically in
the optical frequency before resonance, which is corresponding with that between two
nanoparticles. The spectral E in the infrared frequency is approaching to 1, which also
means that the MBI has little effect on the thermal radiative heat transfer between Ag
metallic nanoparticle clusters. Enhancement factor of RHT for both metallic
nanoparticle clusters and dielectric clusters of SiC is shown as a function of d in Fig.
6(b). For dielectric nanoparticle clusters, MBI inhibits RHT in both near field and far
field. In contrast, generally speaking, Enhancement factor of RHT for metallic
nanoparticle clusters keeps constant (E=1) with various d, which means that MBI has
unobvious effect on the RHT for metallic nanoparticle clusters in both near field and
far field. Meanwhile, the inhibition of MBI on RHT for dielectric nanoparticle clusters
decreases with the increasing separating gap, which is consistent with the results
obtained by EP approach [29].

C. Effect of relative orientation
Thermal conductance between two Ag nanoparticles clusters in three different
relative orientations (parallel, oblique and vertical) is shown as a function of separation
distance d in Fig. 7. When d is larger than 3m, both relative orientation and fractal
dimension have no effect on the RHT. For clusters with high fractal dimension (Df =2.8),
rotation of the clusters has little effect on the RHT. When it comes to clusters with low
fractal dimension (Df =1.8), rotation of the clusters has significant effect on the RHT in
near field. Nanoparticles from clusters in proximity and the number of nanoparticles
from the emitting and the absorbing clusters play a dominant role in determining the
NFRHT between nanoparticle clusters. For clusters of which the Df is 1.8, radiative heat
flux of clusters with vertical orientation is much larger than that of the clusters with
oblique and parallel orientation. The straight-line distance of particles in proximity
from emitting and absorbing clusters with vertical orientation is much smaller than that
of clusters with oblique and parallel orientation. In general, relative orientation has
remarkable effect on radiative heat flux for clusters with lacy structure when the
separation distance is in the near field. While for the separation distance in far field,
both the relative orientation and the fractal dimension has a weak influence on radiative
heat flux.

IV. CONCLUSIONS
Near field effect is a key factor to influence thermal radiation transfer in dense
particulate system when the particle separation distance is comparable to or less than
the characteristic thermal wavelength. Near field radiative heat transfer between Ag
metallic nanoparticle clusters in both near field and far field was studied by using the
CEMD approach, considering contributions of all four electromagnetic field terms from
electric and magnetic polarizations, namely EE, EM, ME and MM. The EP approach
that considers only contribution of electric polarization underestimates the RHT in both
near field and far field, which is attributed to the dominant role of MM contribution in
the RHT between Ag metallic nanoparticle clusters. The effect of MBI on the RHT
between Ag metallic nanoparticle clusters is unobvious at room temperature, while MBI
inhibits the RHT between dielectric nanoparticle clusters. Effects of fractal dimension
and relative orientation on RHT are also analyzed. When the separation distance is
small (less than 1m), thermal conductance between two Ag nanoparticles clusters
increases with the fractal dimension. While when the separation distance is large
enough, the fractal dimension shows little effect on the thermal conductance. The
relative orientation has remarkable effect on radiative heat flux for clusters with lacy
structure when the separation distance is in the near field. While for the separation
distance in far field, both the relative orientation and the fractal dimension has a weak
influence on radiative heat flux. A possible extension of this work is to take the interplay
between the periodic configuration of many particles system and RHT into
consideration [42] in the future.
