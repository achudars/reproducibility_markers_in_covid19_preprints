Abstract—In this paper, we provide a time-series distribution
test system. This test system is a fully observable distribution
grid in Midwest U.S. with smart meters (SM) installed at all
end users. Our goal is to share a real U.S. distribution grid
model without modification. This grid model is comprehensive
and representative since it consists of both overhead lines
and underground cables, and it has standard distribution grid
components such as capacitor banks, line switches, substation
transformers with load tap changer and secondary distribution
transformers. An important uniqueness of this grid model is it has
one-year smart meter measurements at all nodes, thus bridging
the gap between existing test feeders and quasi-static time-series
based distribution system analysis.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Distribution test feeders have been designed to address
various analytic challenges. The previous test feeders can
be roughly classified into two categories based on their authenticity (Table I): Class I - Realistic Test Systems: Making
modifications on real distribution system, a number of standard
test feeders have been developed to represent different types
of networks [1]–[4]. In [1], the Distribution System Analysis
(DSA) subcommittee published the first five IEEE distribution
test feeders, which are widely used among researchers. In [2],
a comprehensive test feeder was proposed. Here “comprehensiveness” means it contains all standard distribution grid
components such as voltage regulator, distribution transformer
and line switch. In [3], the IEEE 8500-Node Test Feeder
was published to represent a large-sized unbalanced radial
distribution system at both medium voltage (MV) and low
voltage (LV) levels. In [4], the IEEE 342-Node Low Voltage
Networked Test System with heavily meshed topology was
developed to provide a benchmark for non-radial distribution network analysis. In [5], the IEEE Neutral-Earth-Voltage
(NEV) Test Feeder was developed to study neutral conductor’s
voltage rise considering the resistance between the neutral
conductor and earth ground. In [6], the IEEE European Low

Voltage Test Feeder was published for researchers to study
typical low voltage networks in Europe. In [7]–[10], six real
large-scale test feeders were published by Electric Power
Research Institute (EPRI) to provide models for researchers
interested in solar integration studies. Class II - Synthetic Test
Systems: Due to the limited number of standard test feeders,
synthetic test systems have been developed as alternatives to
flexibly represent various real networks. In [11], 24 synthetic
test feeders were presented, which characterize distribution
systems in different regions of U.S. A clustering algorithm
was used for developing these synthetic test feeders based on
the data from 575 real distribution networks.
These existing works provide researchers useful benchmarks
to utilize realistic distribution system models for power flow
analysis, optimal equipment placement, islanded operation,
renewable integration studies, state estimation and optimal
power flow [12]. However, Class I test feeders are stationary
single-snapshot models, which generally lack real time-series
measurements. This hinders their application for quasi-static
time-series distribution system analysis, which requires capturing time-varying load behaviors [12]. Furthermore, the outcomes of different systemic studies obtained from artificiallydeveloped Class II test systems might not be easily generalized
to practical networks. To the best of our knowledge, the
IEEE European Low Voltage Test Feeder [6] is the only
existing test feeder with time-series load data, as shown in
Table I. Nonetheless, utilizing the European test feeder is
still challenging for quasi-static time-series analysis due to
three limitations: the first problem is the limited data length,
which is confined to one day. This short period might not
be sufficient for accurately tracking the time-varying behavior
of the system in the long run. The second limitation is the
absence of common network components in this test system,
such as shunt capacitor banks and voltage regulators. The
last limitation is that there exist differences in the distribution
system structure and operation between the U.S. and Europe
[12]. Hence, it is necessary to publish test systems with longterm time-series load data, common network components, and
real circuit models [12].
This paper presents a test system with one-year time-series
power consumption data from more than 1120 customers.
Specifically, the test system is a real fully observable dis-

tribution network located in the Midwest U.S. The electric
components include overhead lines and underground cables
with a variety of phase configurations, load tap changing transformers, various secondary distribution transformers, shunt capacitor banks, and circuit breakers. The data includes one-year
smart meter measurements of all customers, system component
parameters, and detailed network topology. Our goal is to
release a real distribution grid model and field measurements
with minimum modification. However, when sharing the real
data for research purpose and data analysis, it is important
to consider data privacy issues [13]. To protect sensitive
information of data owners, one minor modification is that the
individual customers’ power consumption (measured by smart
meters) has been aggregated at the secondary distribution
transformer level (120/240V). In this way, we avoid disclosing
individual customers’ load behaviors. The detailed information
of the presented test system can be downloaded from our
website [14].

II. D ESCRIPTION OF THE T IME -S ERIES T EST S YSTEM
A. System Description
The time-series test system is a radial distribution system
consisting of three feeders which are supplied by a 69 kV
substation, as shown in Fig. 1. This test system is a real
distribution grid located in the Midwest U.S. The real system
belongs to a municipal utility and is a fully observable network
with smart meters installed at all customers. The test system
has 240 primary network nodes and 23 miles of primary feeder
conductor. Notice that customers are connected to these primary network nodes via secondary distribution transformers,
as can be seen in Fig. 3.

B. Time-series Data Description
In this test system, the time-series data of each node is
directly obtained from customers’ SM measurements. The data
ranges from January 2017 to December 2017. The available
SM data contains hourly energy consumption (kWh) of 1120
customers. To perform time-series power flow analysis, the
hourly average kW demand is approximated by the hourly
energy consumption based on the assumption that the customer
demand is constant in each one-hour time interval [15].
To determine the reactive power, the power factor of each
customer is randomly picked in the range of 0.9 to 0.95. A
statistical approach is utilized to remove grossly erroneous and
missing data samples [16]. Unlike the short-term demand data,
our one-year period load data captures seasonal variations of
customer behaviors. Fig. 2 shows one week load patterns at a
selected primary node in different seasons.
C. Load Tap Changing Substation Transformer
The three feeders in the presented test system are supplied
by a 69/13.8 kV step-down three-phase substation transformer
with an on-load tap changing mechanism. The kVA rating
and connection of the substation transformer are 10,000
kVA and delta-wye, respectively. The primary winding of
the substation transformer is connected to a sub-transmission
system which is equivalent to a swing bus. The equivalent
short circuit impedance of the sub-transmission system are
also provided. Accordingly, the positive-sequence resistance,
positive-sequence reactance, zero-sequence resistance, and
zero-sequence reactance are 4.5426 Ω, 10.5274 Ω, 7.3655 Ω
and 24.5046 Ω, respectively.
The tap-changing mechanism consists of three independent
single-phase tap changers. The voltage ratings, kVA ratings,
voltage settings, bandwidth, maximum voltage limit, minimum
voltage limit, and the number of steps of each tap changer are

The test system has two shunt capacitor banks for voltage

III. A N UMERICAL E XAMPLE OF THE TEST SYSTEM
The time-series simulation of the test system is performed using the OpenDSS simulation program, which is
a commonly-used open-source solver [17]. Matlab-OpenDSS
COM interface is employed to run time-series power flow over
a one-year period. Meanwhile, the power flow results that
include bus voltages and line currents are collected through
the interface.
Voltage level is a critical concern for utilities, therefore, it
is of importance to analyze the range of bus voltages in the
power flow solutions. Fig. 5 shows the statistical results of the
primary main feeder buses’ voltages of Feeder C over a year.
It can be seen that the voltage in this test system is within the
range of 1.005 p.u. to 1.035 p.u., which satisfies the voltage
quality requirement.
Fig. 6 shows the tap positions of the load tap changing
transformer and voltage profiles of Bus 1 during one peak
demand week from July 1st to July 7th. Fig. 6a, Fig. 6b
and Fig. 6c correspond to phase A, phase B and phase C,
respectively. It can be seen that once the voltage drops below
the voltage setting, the regulator will increase the tap position
from 2 to 3, and consequently, the voltage increases.
To check the convergence of the OpenDss simulation model,
error checking is conducted on the time-series power flow
solution. The calculated power of each bus is obtained based
on the bus voltages and line currents from the power flow
solution. Then, the error is obtained by evaluating the difference between the calculated power and the expected power.
Fig. 7 shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of

the percentage error, where 95% of the error samples are less
than (3 × 10−3 )%.
This test system has been used in the literature [16][18] to develop and verify machine learning-based algorithms
for load inference and distribution system state estimation.
The OpenDSS model of this real distribution grid can be
downloaded from [14].
IV. C ONCLUSION
This paper presents a distribution test system based on
a real distribution grid in Midwest U.S. We provide the
real network topologies and electric equipment parameters.
Compared to existing test systems, this system is unique as we
have released the associated one-year real measurement data
from smart meters. In addition, the OpenDSS model of this test
system is available on our website. The test system provides
researchers an opportunity to validate and demonstrate their
theoretical work using a real distribution grid model with field
measurements.
