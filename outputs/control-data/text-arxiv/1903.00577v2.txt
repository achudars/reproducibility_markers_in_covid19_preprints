ABSTRACT
Mercury’s magnetosphere is known to be affected by the enhanced ram pressure and magnetic fields
inside interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). Here we report detailed observations of an ICME
compressing Mercury’s dayside magnetosphere to the surface. A fast CME launched from the Sun on
November 29 2013 impacted first MESSENGER, which was orbiting Mercury, on November 30 and
later STEREO-A near 1 AU on December 1. Following the ICME impact, MESSENGER remained in
the solar wind as the spacecraft traveled inwards and northwards towards Mercury’s surface until it
reached and passed its closest approach to the planet (at 371 km altitude) without crossing into the
magnetosphere. The magnetospheric crossing finally occurred 1 minute before reaching the planet’s
nightside at 400 km altitude and 84◦ N latitude, indicating the lack of dayside magnetosphere on this
orbit. In addition, the peak magnetic field measured by MESSENGER at this time was 40% above the
values measured in the orbits just prior to and after the ICME, a consequence of the magnetospheric
compression. Using both a proxy method at Mercury and measurements at STEREO-A, we show that
the extremely high ram pressure associated with this ICME was more than high enough to collapse
Mercury’s weak magnetosphere. As a consequence, the ICME plasma likely interacted with Mercury’s
surface, evidenced by enhanced sodium ions in the exosphere. The collapse of Mercury’s dayside
magnetosphere has important implications for the habitability of close-in exoplanets around M dwarf
stars, as such events may significantly contribute to planetary atmospheric loss in these systems.
1. INTRODUCTION

Mercury is the only planet in the inner solar system, other than Earth, that possesses a dynamo-generated global,
albeit weak, magnetic field (Ness et al. 1975; Anderson et al. 2011). Mercury’s proximity to the Sun, with a heliocentric
distance between 0.31 and 0.47 au, results in more extreme solar wind and interplanetary conditions than at any other
planet in our solar system. As a consequence of this weak internal magnetic field and strong upstream conditions, the
magnetosphere of Mercury is highly dynamic (e.g., Slavin & Holzer 1979; Glassmeier et al. 2007). This is especially
true during times of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs), which travel at high speeds compared to the solar
wind (up to 3000 km s−1 ) and carry mass and magnetic field from the Sun (Manchester et al. 2017). It has long been
hypothesized (e.g., Slavin & Holzer 1979; Kabin et al. 2000; Slavin et al. 2010) that the magnetic flux on Mercury’s
dayside may be completely eroded or compressed below the surface during such extreme conditions, and that erosion
via reconnection is likely the dominant physical process causing this.
The MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER Solomon et al. 2007) spacecraft orbited Mercury between March 2011 and April 2015. Its highly eccentric orbit around Mercury had periapsis

altitudes between 200-500 km and apoapsis altitudes of 10,000-12,000 km. This allowed the spacecraft to spend a
significant fraction of each orbit both in the solar wind and in the magnetosphere. The years MESSENGER orbited
Mercury corresponded to the maximum phase of solar cycle 24. As such, MESSENGER was able to directly measure
the effects of ICMEs on Mercury’s magnetosphere. Over the duration of the mission, 69 ICMEs were detected by
MESSENGER (Winslow et al. 2015, 2017).
Mercury’s weak internal field (Ness et al. 1975; Anderson et al. 2011; Johnson et al. 2012), described by a dipole
3
with a moment of 190 nT RM
(where RM is Mercury’s radius), offset 0.2 RM northward from the geographic equator
(Anderson et al. 2011, 2012; Johnson et al. 2012; Winslow et al. 2014), does not present a large obstacle to the solar
wind. During average solar wind conditions (Winslow et al. 2013), the magnetopause subsolar stand-off distance, RSS ,
is 1.45 RM from the planet’s center, and the bow shock subsolar stand-off distance is 1.96 RM , about 5-6 times closer
to the planet than those of Earth. These distances are largely controlled by solar wind parameters (Winslow et al.
2013) and are most strongly affected during ICMEs when conditions are extreme (Slavin et al. 2014; Winslow et al.
2017). In Winslow et al. (2017), we described the average effect of CMEs on Mercury’s magnetosphere based on 113
MESSENGER orbits affected by ICMEs. We concluded that due to enhanced dynamic pressure during ICMEs, the
average subsolar location of the magnetopause was 15% closer to the planet. Based on the typical shape of Mercury’s
boundaries, these measurements indicate that the magnetopause was likely at the planet’s surface during ∼30% of
ICME-affected MESSENGER orbits (Winslow et al. 2017). Comparable estimates based on all orbits (not only those
affected by ICMEs) suggest this occurs ∼ 1.5–4% of the time (Johnson et al. 2016). We also determined that the solar
wind had an average ram pressure of 86 nPa during the ICME-affected orbits for which the magnetopause may have
reached the surface, 6 times larger than typical conditions.
In this paper, we examine in detail unambiguous evidence of the collapse of Mercury’s dayside magnetosphere due to
the highest ever ram pressure values estimated at Mercury that were associated with an ICME in late November 2013.
The ICME affected two consecutive orbits of MESSENGER around Mercury. Because the magnetospheric perturbation
was strongest during the first orbit, we analyzed this orbit (orbit 2577) in detail (Figure 1a). In a paper published
independently of this work, Slavin et al. (2019) also analyzed the effect of this ICME on Mercury’s magnetosphere.
However, their work focused on the second ICME-affected orbit which displayed less extreme solar wind conditions and
magnetospheric response than in the first ICME-affected orbit analyzed in this study (Figure 1a). Slavin et al. (2019)
emphasized flux transfer events (FTEs Russell & Elphic 1978; Slavin et al. 2012), whereas we focus on demonstrating
unambiguously, the compression of Mercury’s dayside magnetosphere to the surface. The organization of this paper
is as follows: in Section 2, we discuss the upstream solar wind measurements, both by MESSENGER but also at
STEREO-A which was radially aligned with MESSENGER and provides a more comprehensive view of this event. In
Section 3, we present direct evidence that the dayside magnetopause of Mercury was compressed down to the planetary
surface. In Section 4, we discuss the magnetospheric conditions, both in terms of the enhanced peak fields as well as
the conditions of the magnetotail. We discuss our results and conclude in Section 5.

2. SOLAR WIND RAM PRESSURE

The ICME was launched from the Sun on November 29 2013. At that time, MESSENGER was at a distance of
0.40 au from the Sun and ∼ 120◦ west of the Sun-Earth line and the STEREO-A spacecraft (Kaiser et al. 2008) was
at a distance of 0.96 au and ∼ 150◦ west of the Sun-Earth line. The ICME was moderately fast, with a speed in
the corona of about 700-900 km s−1 . The detailed analysis of the initial phase of the ICME propagation, including
its direction, kinematics and the formation of a CME-driven shock has been published in Schmidt et al. (2016). The
CME was found to be launched about 135◦ from the Sun-Earth line, so almost exactly halfway between Mercury and
STEREO-A directions. The ICME reached Mercury at 14:25:35 UT on November 30 2013, and was observed in situ by
the Magnetometer (Anderson et al. 2007) onboard MESSENGER (Figure 1a) to affect two consecutive MESSENGER
orbits around Mercury (orbits 2577 and 2578). During orbit 2577, the periapsis altitude of MESSENGER was 371 km
while the apoapsis altitude was 10,302 km, and MESSENGER was in an 8-hour orbit.
The magnetic field direction in the magnetic cloud was predominantly southward (-BZ ), however, it had a northward
(BZ ) component for ∼30 mins prior to MESSENGER crossing into Mercury’s magnetosphere on this first ICMEaffected orbit. In discussion of MESSENGER magnetic field data we use MSO coordinates, where XM SO is positive
sunward, ZM SO is positive northward, YM SO is positive duskward and completes the right-handed system, and the
origin is at the center of the planet.

Due to the lack of direct solar wind observations by MESSENGER (Andrews et al. 2007), we first used proxy
methods to estimate the relevant ICME parameters at this time. Using the modified Newtonian approximation
described in equation (4) of Winslow et al. (2017), we estimated the ram pressure, Pram , to be 385 ± 177 nPa from
the inbound magnetopause crossing on orbit 2577. The error bar reflects the uncertainty in the angle between the
magnetopause normal and the upstream solar wind direction, as well as the uncertainty in the fraction of the solar
wind ram pressure that gets transferred into the magnetosheath. The magnetopause crossing position was identified
following the approach outlined in Winslow et al. (2013). In comparison, the average Pram at Mercury is 14 nPa, nearly

field magnitude and components, the plasma temperature, plasma density, plasma speed, the ram pressure of the plasma, as
well as the θnorth−south angle. The magnetic field vector components are shown in heliospheric radial-tangential-normal (RTN)
coordinates. The Pram value shown assumes an alpha to proton ratio of 5% in the plasma, which is the lower limit during this
ICME event.

thirty times lower. From the ICME launch time at the Sun (Winslow et al. 2015) and the arrival time at Mercury,
we calculated the Sun-to-Mercury transit speed to be ∼800 km s−1 , which together with the Pram estimate yields a
plasma number density of ∼360 cm−3 , compared to ∼50 cm−3 on average.
As the STEREO-A spacecraft was in near-longitudinal alignment with MESSENGER at this time, this same ICME
was also observed by STEREO-A near 1 au. The STEREO spacecraft have a full suite of plasma instruments taking
continuous measurements of the solar wind (Galvin et al. 2008), which can be scaled to Mercury’s location to provide
an independent estimate of the ram pressure during this ICME. Assuming an alpha to proton ratio (He/H) in the
plasma of 5%, which is typical of the solar wind, the maximum Pram of 38 nPa at STEREO A (Figure 2) yields 234
nPa at MESSENGER, with a scaling of 1/r2 with heliocentric distance. However, He/H ratios as high as 33% were
observed by STEREO-A during this ICME (private communication, A.B. Galvin, 2019), yielding a Pram of 63 nPa at
1 au and 388 nPa at Mercury (at 0.4 au). These scaled STEREO A observations are in agreement within uncertainty
with the Pram proxy value we obtained from the Newtonian approximation at MESSENGER, fully supporting the
estimate of a very high Pram during this ICME. The Pram measured near 1 au corresponds to one of the highest 0.01%
ram pressure values measured at L1 during the 4 years of the MESSENGER mission. Using spacecraft measurements
at Earth’s L1 during these 4 years, Pram reached as high as 35 nPa for only 8 distinct 5-minute periods out of 395,000
such periods. All this supports the fact that this was an extremely high ram pressure event both at Mercury and 1 au.
3. MAGNETOPAUSE COMPRESSION TO THE SURFACE

The most remarkable effect of this ICME on Mercury was the complete compression of the dayside magnetopause to
the surface (Figures 1 and 3) resulting from the very high Pram . During noon-midnight orbits, MESSENGER regularly
spent ∼20 minutes sampling Mercury’s low-latitude dayside magnetosphere, usually entering the magnetosphere at
latitudes close to the equator. Even though MESSENGER was in a noon-midnight orbit during this ICME, the location
of the dayside magnetopause crossing into the magnetosphere occurred at a high latitude of 84◦ N, a longitude of 50◦ ,

Time relative to equator crossing (mins)

Figure 3. Comparison of MESSENGER’s magnetospheric pass on the pre-ICME orbit with the first ICME
affected orbit. Magnetic field data versus time relative to the magnetic equator crossing times for orbits 2576 (thin lines) and
2577 (thick lines). Equator crossing times were at UTC 10:07:02 and UTC 18:07:49 for orbits 2576 and 2577, respectively.

and an altitude of only ∼400 km (Figures 1b,c and Figure 3). Prior to this crossing, MESSENGER was at altitudes
less than 400 km at more southern latitudes and the magnetosphere was not encountered (spacecraft closest approach
occurred at an altitude of 371 km and a latitude of 76.7◦ N). Less than 1 minute after crossing the magnetopause,
MESSENGER crossed the dawn-dusk terminator and entered the nightside. Thus unlike typical noon-midnight orbits,
MESSENGER spent less than 1 minute in the dayside after crossing the magnetopause, which explains the lack of
a cusp crossing. No dayside northward magnetic field direction was observed in the magnetosphere (Figure 1b,c and
Figure 3). The field lines that MESSENGER sampled immediately after entering the magnetosphere were southward
and sunward pointing, consistent with field lines in the high northern hemisphere close to and threading the night-side.
We also note that there was a very thin inbound magnetopause layer on this orbit that lasted < 2 mins, indicating
quasi-steady external forcing conditions at this time.
In Figure 3, MESSENGER orbits 2576 (the orbit just prior to the ICME arrival) and 2577 (the first orbit affected
by the ICME in question) were aligned in time on their equator crossing times to compare the magnetic field data
before and after the ICME arrival. The increase in field strength in the nightside magnetosphere after the ICME
arrival is evident from orbit 2576 to 2577, with peak field strengths of ∼405 nT and ∼575 nT on orbits 2576 and 2577,
respectively. Furthermore, the almost complete absence of the dayside field on orbit 2577 compared to orbit 2576 is
striking: the dayside northern hemisphere dipole field on orbit 2576 is seen via downward pointing (negative BZ ),
anti-sunward (negative BX ) field, that was absent on orbit 2577.
The established shape and location of Mercury’s magnetopause and bow shock determined empirically provide
further confirmation of the extreme compression. Similarly to Winslow et al. (2013, 2017), we fit empirical models to
the magnetopause and bow shock crossing points to characterize the magnetospheric boundaries during orbit 2577.
For the bow shock, we used a conic section given by

where R is the distance from the dipole center and α is the flaring parameter that governs how open the magnetotail
is. The average magnetopause shape at Mercury (Winslow et al. 2013) has α = 0.5, and α > 0.5 implies an open
magnetosphere while α < 0.5 implies a closed magnetosphere.
The Shue et al. (1997) magnetopause model has been shown to fit Mercury’s average magnetopause shape well,
under both nominal and extreme solar wind conditions (Winslow et al. 2013, 2017). We use this axially symmetric
model to illustrate the possible magnetospheric shape of Mercury at this time, and we note that a 3 dimensional model
specifically developed for Mercury (Zhong et al. 2015) does exist, but contains additional parameters that cannot be
constrained by the data available here.
We used the above models to fit our ICME-affected bow shock and magnetopause crossing locations, corrected
for solar wind aberration, using a grid search method that minimized the root mean square (RMS) residual of the
perpendicular distance of the observed boundary crossing from the model boundary. Although not the focus of the
paper, these fits indicate that the bow shock was also substantially compressed on orbit 2577 (Figure 4), having an
estimated subsolar stand-off distance of 0.61 RM with best-fit model parameters of X0 = 0,  = 1.46, and p = 1.02 RM .

Figure 5. Schematic view of Mercury’s magnetosphere, shown in the frame of reference of the solar wind flow,
during the first ICME affected orbit. The ICME compressed the dayside magnetosphere to the surface, leaving the region
directly exposed to the solar wind. A larger surface area is exposed in the southern hemisphere than in the north due to
Mercury’s northward-offset dipole.

This fit result implies a bow shock with a stand-off distance that is below the surface and is smaller than that of the
magnetopause. Even in the absence of a dayside magnetopause, one still expects a bow shock to form above the
planetary surface due to the obstacle of the planet itself; the bow shock is needed to deflect the plasma around it. This
does suggest that the model breaks down for such extreme solar wind conditions, although the fit is likely correct for
the part of the orbit where the crossing points actually are (i.e. where the fit is done).
For the inbound and outbound aberrated magnetopause crossings on this orbit, the best-fit Shue et al. model yields
an Rss of 0.69 RM , i.e. a value that is well below the surface (Figure 4; see Section 4.2.1 for tilting of the magnetotail).
It is conceivable that a different magnetopause shape with a very large cusp (such as is possible in the Zhong et al.
(2015) model) might be below MESSENGERs orbit but still be above the surface in some of the northern hemisphere.
Without a probe on the surface, such a scenario cannot be ruled out. However, combining different lines of evidence,
such as the measured bow shock (see Figure 4) and magnetopause locations, the very large inferred Pram , and the
fact that the magnetopause was not observed at any latitude below 84◦ N even though the lowest altitude reached by
MESSENGER during this orbit occurred at 76.7◦ N, the evidence clearly supports the complete absence of a dayside
magnetosphere in this case (Figure 5).
For the model fits to the boundary locations, we used the instantaneous boundary crossings nearest to the magnetosphere for both the inbound and outbound crossings, and fit the inbound and outbound points with one model.
Fitting the inbound and outbound magnetopause crossings with one magnetopause model assumes that the solar wind
conditions do not change substantially in the 1 hr between the inbound and outbound observations. This assumption
is not unreasonable for an ICME passage, during which the solar wind plasma and magnetic field parameters are
expected to vary more slowly than under average solar wind conditions.
From statistical analysis of the response of Mercury’s magnetopause to solar wind ram pressure using MESSENGER
observations, Winslow et al. (2013) estimated that a Pram of 175 nPa would be enough to collapse Mercury’s magnetosphere to the surface. In the global MHD simulations conducted by Kabin et al. (2000), a Pram of 147 nPa was
found to accomplish this task, however, this model did not include induction effects from Mercury’s core. Jia et al.
(2019) recently included induction effects in MHD simulations of the Mercury-solar wind interaction. They found

8

Winslow et al.

that in simulations without induction, 56 nPa was sufficient for the magnetopause to reach the southern hemisphere
surface, while if induction was included, most of the magnetosphere was above the surface for the highest tested Pram of
107 nPa. This shows that the strong interplay between induction and compression has an important effect on the size
of Mercury’s magnetosphere. Overall, these studies predict compression to Mercury’s surface at Pram ∼ 150–175 nPa.
Given the much higher Pram of 385 ± 177 nPa estimated for the ICME in our study and supported by the STEREO-A
scaled observations, it is not surprising that it collapsed Mercury’s dayside magnetosphere. Also, using our estimated
∼385 nPa Pram , we find that the pressure balance condition of the magnetopause (Kallenrode 2004), which does not
depend on any model assumption for the magnetopause shape, results in a magnetopause subsolar stand-off distance
of 0.74 RM .
We also calculate the surface area of the region directly exposed to the solar wind to be ∼ 50% of the total planetary
surface. This estimate is obtained from where our best-fit Shue et al. magnetopause model (Figure 4) intersects the
planetary surface in the northern and southern hemispheres, with the northward offset dipole taken into consideration.
We note that this estimate is dependent on the magnetopause model used, and it may be an upper limit given that
the Shue model does not account for any possible cusp indentations of the magnetopause.
4. MAGNETOSPHERIC CONDITIONS

4.1. Field Enhancements
Another remarkable effect of this ICME on Mercury’s magnetosphere was the ∼40% increase in the observed field
strength at the spacecraft’s closest-approach (represented by the peak in the field) compared to orbits prior to, and
after the ICME (Figure 1a). We investigated whether this increased field strength could be attributed to an induction
effect resulting from magnetospheric compression. Annual induction signals have been observed in MESSENGER data
(Johnson et al. 2016) and larger signals are expected during times of extreme compression (Glassmeier et al. 2007). For
example, self-similar compression of the magnetosphere (uniform scaling in X, Y, and Z), corresponding to a change
in subsolar distance from 1.6RM to 1RM could result in an increase in the internal dipole moment of up to ∼25%,
similar to the observed increase in the field strength. However, an induction effect would increase the magnitude of
all three components close to the planet, which was not observed. Figure 3 shows that the increase in the field was
almost entirely due to an increase in BX , which persisted throughout the orbit. In contrast, the BY component was
almost identical on both orbit 2577 and the orbit prior to the ICME arrival, and BZ decreases slightly close to the
planet. In the tail, the field magnitude was enhanced by a factor of ∼4 on orbit 2577 compared to 2576, suggesting that
very different tail conditions (specifically a very strong magnetotail current, see Section 4.2.2 below), not induction,
dominate the observed signal.
4.2. Magnetotail Conditions
In this section we explore Mercury’s magnetotail conditions during this first ICME-affected orbit. Despite the
enhancement in the magnetotail field during this event, we found no evidence for flaring of the tail (Section 4.2.1 below).
This, together with the calculated tail flux of 2.73 ± 0.86 MWb (see Section 4.2.2 below), consistent with the average
value of 2.6 ± 0.6 MWb observed at Mercury (Johnson et al. 2012), shows that the increase in the magnetotail field
strength was not caused by flux-loading of the tail. The absence of flaring implies that Dungey cycle magnetospheric
convection did not substantially enhance the tail field, which is supported by the fact that there are only a few FTEs.
These FTEs are observed near the inbound magnetopause between latitudes of 65 to 90 deg, indicating some highlatitude reconnection. Low-latitude reconnection is ruled out because of the lack of dayside magnetosphere. However,
observations by the Fast Imaging Plasma Spectrometer (FIPS) (Andrews et al. 2007) onboard MESSENGER indicate
that plasma was present in the southern tail lobe (Figure 7), likely convected into the magnetosphere through the
plasma mantle or via lobe convection driven by high-latitude reconnection.
4.2.1. Lack of Tail Flaring
Two lines of evidence support the inference of a magnetotail lacking substantial flaring during the passage of the
ICME. First, the topology of the tail current sheet can be inferred from the direction of the field lines. A high amplitude
of the BY and BZ components relative to the BX component imply that the tail is flared and can suggest tail loading.
We calculated |BY |/|BX | (and |BZ |/|BX |) in different regions of the tail (following Slavin et al. (2010)), but no tail
loading events were detected. We also calculated an average |BY |/|BX | (and |BZ |/|BX |) over the tail region for orbit
2577. For orbit 2576 (i.e., prior to the ICME arrival) the average |BY |/|BX | was 0.27 whereas on orbit 2577 the

Collapse of Mercury’s Dayside Magnetosphere

average |BY |/|BX | was 0.13 (|BZ |/|BX | was even lower). This results from the dominant and large amplitude BX on
orbit 2577. The large static/thermal pressure in the sheath compressing the tail likely contributed to the observed
lack of tail flaring at this time. These results imply lower tail flaring on orbit 2577 than on orbit 2576, indicating that
tail loading with magnetic flux was not occurring during orbit 2577.
Second, the shape of the magnetopause boundary in the tail also provides information on the tail geometry. We fit
the Shue et al. (1997) magnetopause model to the magnetopause boundary crossings inbound (high latitude northern
hemisphere) and outbound (southern hemisphere) on this orbit to obtain the shape of the magnetopause, and therefore
the magnetotail on this orbit (as described in Section 3 and shown in Figure 4). The initial fit yielded a slightly flared
(α = 0.58; α = 0.5 indicates no flaring) magnetopause due to the location of the outbound magnetopause crossing in
the southern hemisphere. However, tilting of the tail southward due to non-radial ICME flows can cause the outbound
magnetopause crossing to be observed farther south than it would be if there were no tail tilting, which can be mistaken
for flaring of the magnetotail in an empirical fit.
We confirmed that the tail was actually tilted southward and not flared by comparing the location of the magnetic
equator on this orbit with the average magnetic equator crossing location. Mercury’s magnetic equator is observed on
average (Johnson et al. 2018) at Z = 484 ± 3 km, whereas on orbit 2577 the northernmost and southernmost crossings
of the magnetic equator occurred at Z = 463 km and Z = 347 km respectively, both south of the average value. The
southward tilting of the magnetotail implies southward tilting of the field lines. To check that this was the case on
this orbit, we calculated tan(BZ /BX ) in the tail and found a ∼ 5◦ downward (i.e., southward) deflection of the field
lines, in line with a southward tail tilting.
Further support for tilting of the tail is the fact that there were strong non-radial flows in the ICME. Although we do
not have solar wind velocity and density data for this ICME at Mercury, the solar wind velocity at STEREO A shows
strong excursions both north and south from radial flow (i.e. away from the ecliptic) during this ICME passage. We
determined θnorth−south , as described in Anderson et al. (2012) and found it to range between −9◦ and 12◦ at STEREO
A (see Figure 2), larger than than the average non-radial solar wind flow at Mercury of 4◦ . As shown in Anderson
et al. (2012), an average non-radial flow at Mercury is able to cause tail tilting. Given that we observed the magnetic
equator southward of the average location, we can assume that at the time of the orbit in question MESSENGER
was in the portion of the ICME that had a southward directed flow, with an average θnorth−south of ∼ −5◦ . We thus
assumed θnorth−south = −5◦ during this time at Mercury, which is also supported by the observed degree of field line
tilting in the tail as mentioned above. We corrected the outbound magnetopause and bow shock crossing points for
this extra aberration, by rotating the points clockwise by θnorth−south . Fitting the Shue et al. (1997) model to the
corrected magnetopause location yields a boundary with a non-flared magnetotail, i.e. a magnetopause with a flaring
parameter of α = 0.51, consistent with the direct observations of extremely low |BY |/|BX | and |BZ |/|BX | ratios at
this time in the tail.
4.2.2. Tail Flux and Tail Current
We calculated the total magnetic flux in the tail from ΦT ail = 0.5πBT ail RT2 ail , where RT ail , the cross-sectional radius
of the tail, is 3800 ± 600 km and was calculated from the location of the midpoint of the outbound magnetopause
crossing in the southern hemisphere (after correcting for the southward tilt of the tail). The uncertainty represents
the inner and outer limits of the magnetopause layer, outside of which MESSENGER was either entirely in the
magnetosheath or in the magnetosphere. BT ail was found to be 114.0 ± 5.2 nT and was calculated by averaging the
magnitude of the magnetic field over 2 minutes prior to the outbound magnetopause crossing, with the uncertainty
being the standard deviation of the field over the averaging period. This yields a total magnetic flux in the tail of
2.6 ± 0.8 MWb, consistent with the average value of 2.6 ± 0.6 MWb observed at Mercury (Johnson et al. 2012).
Tail current sheet (TCS) crossings were identified via a clear rotation in the field direction, specifically a rotation in
BX from sunward in the northern lobe to antisunward in the southern lobe, accompanied by a decrease in the total
field strength |B| and an increase in the high-frequency variability in the field (Slavin et al. 1985). The magnetic field
data from orbit 2576 (Figure 6, top left panel) showed no evidence for a TCS crossing: BX changes smoothly along
the orbit as expected for a mainly dipolar internal field, and there was no decrease in |B| near the equator crossing.
Assuming that any TCS current flows mainly in the Y -direction, the current density, JY is proportional to ∆BX /∆Z.
We computed ∆BX /∆Z numerically along the orbit, and smoothed the estimate with a 30 second running mean. The
resulting JY for orbit 2576 confirms no TCS crossing, i.e., on this orbit the magnetic equator crossing was planetward
of the TCS. In contrast orbit 2577 (Figure 6, right) had a very different signature. The field magnitude in the tail lobe

was ∼125 nT, ∼4 times that for the previous orbit. A pronounced dip in |B| accompanied a reversal in BX near the
magnetic equator crossing. The inferred current density, JY showed a clear peak near Z = 0 km, reaching a maximum
value over 1000 nA m−2 (Figure 6, bottom right panel). This confirms that the tail current moved closer to the planet
relative to the previous orbit and that the current density was particularly intense, being an order of magnitude higher
than during average solar wind at Mercury (Al Asad et al. 2018).
This observed high current sheet density is also a consequence of the very high ICME Pram that collapsed Mercury’s
dayside magnetosphere on this orbit. It has been statistically established at Earth (Fairfield & Jones 1996), and
also recently at Mercury (Al Asad et al. 2018), that an increase in Pram increases the tail lobe field and therefore
the magnetic pressure in the tail. The increased magnetic pressure in the northern and southern tail lobes causes the
current sheet to thin and compresses the total current into a smaller volume thereby increasing the current density. The
strong magnetotail current was likely the main source of the increase in the magnetospheric field at closest-approach
resulting from the strengthened BX component.
5. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, using MESSENGER measurements, we analyzed the response of Mercurys magnetosphere to the
highest solar wind ram pressure ever estimated at Mercury. We have confirmed this estimated value of the ram pressure
by using a complementary dataset from STEREO-A which was in longitudinal conjunction with MESSENGER at this
time. The magnetosphere exhibited never-before observed characteristics due to the passage of an ICME. These

Collapse of Mercury’s Dayside Magnetosphere

observed characteristics of the magnetosphere include the compression of Mercury’s dayside magnetosphere to the
surface (Figures 3, 4, and 5), combined with a ∼ 40% increase in the spacecraft closest approach magnetic field
magnitude, as well as a ∼ 300% increase in the magnetotail magnetic field strength (Figure 1) compared to undisturbed
conditions. First, we presented detailed observational evidence which conclusively show the compression of Mercury’s
dayside magnetosphere on this orbit. Although we used the Shue et al. (1997) model to describe our magnetopause
shape, we have clear observations that are not reliant on any specific model that support the inference of the lack of
dayside magnetosphere on this orbit. These observations are:
• the dayside magnetopause was very close to the surface at high latitude (84◦ N) (Figure 4);
• the dayside magnetopause was not crossed earlier in the orbit (at lower latitudes) when MESSENGER was closer
to the surface (closest approach occurred at 76.7◦ N) (Figures 1 and 7a top panel);
• complete absence of the dayside dipole field in the magnetosphere (Figure 3);
• a thin dayside magnetopause layer (lasting <2 mins) (Figure 1);
• dayside bow shock was also very close to the surface at high latitude (Figure 4);
• Pram calculated using the proxy method and scaling from STEREO-A both result in a value much higher than
needed to collapse Mercury’s weak magnetosphere.
In terms of the large field enhancements during this orbit, we showed that these are not primarily due to induction
in Mercury’s iron rich core, but due to the very strong (order of magnitude higher than normal) magnetotail current
density at this time. The highly increased magnetotail fields, caused by the extremely high ICME Pram , are likely the
largest additions to the planetary dipole field providing the ∼ 40% increased peak field observed by MESSENGER on
this orbit.
Furthermore, we showed that the lack of tail flaring as well as an average tail flux during this orbit support the fact
that no significant dayside reconnection occurred on this orbit. Therefore, the absence of the dayside magnetosphere
was not due to reconnection (as previously thought to be the main mechanism for such magnetospheric collapse), but
due to compression from the increased pressure associated with the ICME at this time.
Recent observations of the exospheric sodium emission pattern at Mercury detected diffused equatorial sodium at
times of ICME passage in general, in contrast to the more commonly observed two-peak pattern at high latitudes in
both hemispheres (Orsini et al. 2018). The major driver of sodium surface release is particle precipitation, thus it is
expected that during average conditions most of the sodium emission is in the cusp regions where the magnetic field is
weakest and particle precipitation is common (Winslow et al. 2012, 2014; Raines et al. 2014; Poh et al. 2016). However,
compression of Mercury’s dayside magnetosphere to the surface allows ICME plasma to directly impact the dayside
at low latitudes, thereby sputtering sodium into the exosphere. Our observation here of such compression provides
evidence for a mechanism of sodium-generation at equatorial latitudes.
We checked whether the FIPS Na+ observations for this ICME are in line with the ground-based sodium observations
during ICMEs by Orsini et al. (2018). On orbit 2577, FIPS observed no dayside equatorial Na+ (Figure 7a), which is
consistent with the collapse of the magnetosphere and the accompanying dominance by ICME particles on this orbit.
However, the following two MESSENGER orbits (Figures 7b and c) showed increased densities over the pre-ICME
levels on most of the dayside, indicating Na+ generation from sputtering by the high density ICME. The increased Na+
densities are observed extending from low to high latitude, in line with the results of Orsini et al. (2018), confirming
increased exospheric generation during this extreme ICME event.
Additionally, the disappearance of Mercury’s dayside magnetosphere may have important implications for exoplanetary systems. M dwarfs, the most common type of star (Henry et al. 2006), can have high occurrence rates of stellar
flares (Odert et al. 2017) and are known to typically host exoplanets (Dressing & Charbonneau 2013). It is unknown
whether the flare-to-CME ratio of M dwarfs is similar to that of the Sun (Odert et al. 2017). However, because the
habitable zone of M dwarfs is ∼10 times closer to the star than in our solar system, exoplanets in these zones are
susceptible to possibly very frequent magnetic eruptive events. ICMEs at close proximity to the host star are likely
to carry higher Pram than that observed in this study, due to the increased ICME speed and density close to the
star. We thus suggest that a habitable exoplanet around an M dwarf might require an intrinsic planetary magnetic
field substantially stronger than that of Mercury to not lose its atmosphere over geologic timescales. It has also been

suggested that tidally locked planets (Kite et al. 2011) may have inherently weaker magnetic moments (Khodachenko
et al. 2007), so that for close-in exoplanets stellar-flare activity and associated ICME interactions may significantly
hinder the emergence and development of life. Based on our results, we thus recommend that modeling of exoplanet
atmospheric loss due to space weather (Dong et al. 2017a,b; Garcia-Sage et al. 2017) take into account the possibility
of magnetospheric collapse events.
Finally, the two spacecraft BepiColombo mission (Benkhoff et al. 2010) arriving at Mercury in 2025, during the next
solar maximum, will be well positioned to observe such magnetospheric collapse events in more detail. The presence
of the Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter (MMO) spacecraft combined with the Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO)
spacecraft will greatly simplify the analysis of future such measurements, as the MMO will act as an upstream solar
wind monitor approximately 80% of the time (i.e., when it is projected to be outside of Mercury’s magnetosphere).
In the 1 year nominal and 1 year extended mission of BepiColombo, we can expect a total of ∼ 35 ICME events

based on the number of ICMEs detected by MESSENGER (Winslow et al. 2015, 2017) in the same part of the solar
cycle. Out of these, ∼ 10 events, or ∼ 30% (Winslow et al. 2017), will likely collapse at least part of Mercury’s
dayside magnetosphere to the surface. This additional dual spacecraft dataset of such events will greatly enhance our
understanding of the physical processes at play during these extreme conditions affecting the solar system’s innermost
planet.
