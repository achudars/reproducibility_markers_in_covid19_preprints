In this work, we study structural and vibrational properties of multilayer graphene using densityfunctional theory (DFT) with van der Waals (vdW) functionals. Initially, we analyze how different
vdW functionals compare by evaluating the lattice parameters, elastic constants and vibrational
frequencies of low energy optical modes of graphite. Our results indicate that the vdW-DF1-optB88
functional has the best overall performance on the description of vibrational properties. Next, we
use this functional to study the influence of the vdW interactions on the structural and vibrational
properties of multilayer graphene. Specifically, we evaluate binding energies, interlayer distances and
phonon frequencies of layer breathing and shear modes. We observe excellent agreement between
our calculated results and available experimental data, which suggests that this functional has truly
predictive power for layer-breathing and shear frequencies that have not been measured yet. This
indicates that careful selected vdW functionals can describe interlayer bonding in graphene-related
systems with good accuracy.

INTRODUCTION

Since the experimental realization of graphene [1–5],
an extensive number of studies have been made on this
material and related structures due to their remarkable
properties and potential applications [6–10]. In particular, one class of graphene related materials that is of great
interest is multilayer graphene. N -layer graphene (NLG)
consists of N stacked graphene layers, which can have
different orientations with respect to each other. Their
mechanical, electronic and optical properties strongly depend on N and their relative [11, 12] orientations, resulting in a wide variety of potential applications [13, 14].
These materials are stable due to the van der Waals
(vdW) interactions between layers (as in graphite).
Therefore, in order to study them from a theoretical
point of view, one needs a good description of these
dispersive interactions, specially for properties related
to interlayer bonding, stiffness and vibrations. In particular, the effects of vdW interactions can be detected
in Raman spectroscopy, as interlayer vibrations in
2D materials can be measured by this technique with
great precision. For this reason, Raman scattering may
be used as a tool to evaluate the accuracy of various
theoretical implementations of vdW interactions in
density-functional theory (DFT) calculations [15–20].
In DFT, the exact exchange-correlation functional
should in principle contain vdW interactions. However,
the exact functional is unknown, and commonly used local (LDA) and semilocal (GGA) approximations do not
capture the effects of vdW interactions, which are dispersion forces arising from long-range electron-electron
correlations [22, 23]. In graphite, it is known that GGA

functionals considerably overestimate the interlayer distance, while describing well the in-plane carbon-carbon
distances. On the other hand, LDA functionals give a
good interplanar distance (although smaller than the experimental value) and underestimates the covalent bond
lengths [24].
In recent works, non-local vdW exchange-correlation
functionals were developed aiming to describe the properties of layered materials, adsorption processes and other
phenomena [25–33]. In particular, in the vdW-DF family of functionals [25], the exchange-correlation energy is
given by:
Exc [n] = ExGGA [n] + EcLDA [n] + Ecnl [n]

(1)

where x and c label the exchange and correlation parts
of the corresponding functionals, respectively, and Ecnl [n]
is a non-local correlation energy given by
Ecnl [n] =

Z

d3 rd3 r0 n(r)φ[n](r, r0 )n(r0 )

(2)

where φ[n] is a two-point kernel function and n(r) is the
electronic density. The different functionals in this family
consist of different combinations of flavors for the GGA
exchange and LDA correlation, as well as different forms
for the two-point kernel [25–33]. They were tailored to
describe properties of specific systems, such as the interaction energy of dimer pairs and the structure of small
molecules. Therefore, their performances can dramatically change depending on chemical environment. For a
complete overview see Refs. 22 and 34.
In this work, we compare the performances of different vdW functionals from the DF family in describing
the elastic constants, binding energy and vibrational frequencies of the shear and layer breathing modes (LBM) of
graphite. Our results indicate that the vdW-DF1-optB88
functional is the best suited functional for graphenebased systems. Next, we use this functional to calculate interlayer distances, binding energies and phonon

2
frequencies of NLG. We find that the inclusion of vdW
interactions is especially important for an accurate description of interlayer distances and out-of-plane vibrational modes.

METHODS

All DFT calculations were performed using the Quantum Espresso package [35, 36]. Energy cutoffs of 60 and
480 Ry are used for the plane-wave expansion of the
wavefunctions and electronic density, respectively. For
graphite calculations, several functionals are used. For
LDA and GGA calculations, we use the PZ and PBE
functionals, respectively [37, 38]. For vdW calculations,
we employ different functionals from the vdW-DF family
[25–33]. In all cases, we use RRKJ ultrasoft pseudopotentials for the ion-electron interaction, including a nonlinear core correction [39]. It should be noted that, so
far, pseudopotentials for non-local functionals have not
been developed, so we use a GGA-derived potential for
the vdW calculations as in [32].
Structural optimizations are done with a convergence
threshold on forces of 10−6 Ry/bohr and on energies of
10−5 Ry. To sample the Brillouin Zone, we have used
Monkhorst-Pack meshes of dimensions 16 × 16 × 16 for
graphite and 16 × 16 × 1 for NLG.
The elastic constants of graphite are calculated from
second order derivatives of the total energy with respect
to the lattice parameters [24, 40]:
1 ∂2E
3c0 ∂a2
2c0 ∂ 2 E
=√ 2 2
3a0 ∂c

C11 + C12 = √
C33

C13 = √

(3)

1 ∂2E
3a0 ∂a∂c

where the derivatives are evaluated at equilibrium. In order to calculate these derivatives, we compute the total
energy for several values of a and c around the equilibrium values a0 and c0 . The resulting energy landscape is
then fitted to two-dimensional fourth order Taylor expansion and the second order coeficients provide the required
derivatives. Exfoliation energies per area for graphite and
NLG are calculated using the following equation

∆Eex (N ) = −

(EN − EN −1 − Egraphene )
A

(4)

and binding energies per area per layer are calculated
using the following equation

∆Eb (N ) = −

(EN /N − Egraphene )
A

(5)

where EN is the total energy per unit cell of NLG or
graphite, and Egraphene is the graphene total energy per
unit cell, and A is the basal area of the unit cell. All
energies are calculated for fully relaxed systems, therefore the calculated exfoliation energies for NLG include
surface relaxation effects. In the case of graphite, in the
limit N → ∞, the exfoliation energy coincides with the
binding energy [41].

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A.

Graphite

Results for lattice constants, elastic constants, binding energies and vibrational frequencies of graphite are
shown in Table I for different functionals. Note that LDA
underestimates the value of a0 and GGA overestimates
the value of c0 , as expected. All vdW functionals give
good values of a0 , with the vdw-DF2 showing the largest
deviation from the experimental value. For c0 , most vdW
functionals show good agreement with experiment. Exceptions are the vdW-DF1 and vdW-DF2 functionals,
which show the largest deviations.
All calculated C13 values are negative, in agreement
with previous theoretical works [24]. Experimental values lie in the range 0-15 GPa, with an error bar of 3 GPa,
so a negative value cannot be entirely discarded. Note
that most vdW functionals give elastic constants with absolute values larger than LDA as these elastic constants
are related to the interactions between graphene layers.
Finally, GGA, vdW-DF1 and vdW-DF2 provide inaccurate descriptions of C11 +C12 because these functionals do
not describe very well the interplanar distance. The use
of experimental values a0 and c0 in Eq. (3) may improve
the evaluation of these elastic constants, as discussed in
Ref. 24.
In Fig. 1, the total energy difference (per area and
per layer) between graphite and graphene as a function
of interlayer separation is shown. The minimum value is,
by definition, the negative of the binding energy, whose
values for different functionals are also reported in Table
I. Experimental values for the exfoliation (or binding) energies are displayed by horizontal dotted lines. We can
see that the LDA and GGA functionals give very small
values for this quantity in comparison with experimental
results while all vdW functionals tend to overestimate it.
Our results show a good agreement with other theoretical
calculations (reported in Table I) using Quantum Monte
Carlo [51], adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation
theorem in the random phase approximation (ACFDTRPA) [50], DFT-D and TS-vdW methods [49, 52] and
vdW functionals [52]. For vdW functionals, it is possible to see two families of curves in the range from 4Å
to 7Å. The solid lines are the vdW-DF type functionals
and dashed lines are vdW-DF2 type functionals. Each
set converges to a particular asymptotic curve, due to
the different asymptotic behaviors of DF1 and DF2 ker-

By using the frozen-phonon technique, the frequencies
of the layer shear and breathing modes (LBM) are calculated and reported in Table I. In this technique, phonon
frequencies are calculated from the curvature of the energy versus displacement curves. The atomic displacements are performed according to a given normal mode,
such that the energy differences with respect to the equilibrium configuration are solely due to this mode [53].
Several vdW functionals (and, interestingly, also LDA)

display frequencies with reasonably good agreement with
experiment [15, 16].

taken into account as all calculated values are far from
experimental values reported in Table I. The reference
experimental values are taken as the mean of avaiable
experimental data and they are also shown in Table I.
Based on this analysis, the functional with best overall
performance would be vdW-DF2-B86r. However, since
our main objective in this work is the calculation of vibrational frequencies in NLG, we also calculate the mean
deviation restricted to the LBM and shear-mode vibrational frequencies, labeled ∆f req in Table I. Based on this
more restricted analysis the vdW-DF1-optB88 functional
shows the best performance with a standard deviation of
5.7%. It should also be mentioned that, even though the
LDA functional also has a good performance, it gives a
quite poor description of the binding energy of graphite,
so we choose the vdW-DF1-optB88 for the study of the
vibrational properties of NLG.
By analizing the results in Table I, we notice a correlation, shown in Fig. 2, between equilibrium c lattice parameters and calculated frequencies using different functionals (green and blue circles). Frequencies tend to be
higher for smaller interlayer distances. As a matter of
fact, this seems to be a fairly universal trend, as it is approximately followed by experimental results in graphite
at zero (red circles) and non-zero pressures (black line
and crosses), and also by calculations using the vdWDF1-optB88 functional and varying the interplanar distance (green dashed line). As one can see, the results for
this functional follow very well the experimental trends
as a function of pressure.

represented by green and blue points. The green points are
results given by the vdW-DF1-optB88 functional, while blue

calculated using the vdW-DF1-optB88 functional for
different interlayer distances, which do not correspond to the
equilibrium value for this functional. Red points are
experimental values from Ref.15. The black line and black

respectively.

B.

N-Layer Graphene

By using the vdW-DF1-optB88 functional, we evaluated the structural and vibrational properties of multilayer graphene, from the bilayer (N = 2) up to 6
stacked layers. In all cases, the layers are AB (Bernal)
stacked. The calculated binding and exfoliation energies
are shown in Fig. 3. As expected, they both converge
to the graphite value with increasing number of layers.
The green and red curves are fits given by the following
equation:

∆Eex(b) (N ) =

A
+ ∆Eex(b) (∞)
Nb

(6)

where ∆Eex(b) (∞) corresponds to graphite. For NLG, by
using the vdW-DF1-optB88 functional, we find b = 0.90
for the binding case and b = 3.20 for the exfoliation
case. Therefore, the binding energy varies more slowly
with N , but both binding and exfoliation energies yield
the graphite exfoliation energy ∆Eex (∞) in the limit
N → ∞, as expected. In fact, the values of ∆Eex (∞) as
given by each fit differ from the actual value by less than
0.014J/m2 . We have also calculated the interlayer dis-

solid lines are fits given by Eq. 6.

tances in all cases and variations with respect to graphite
values are smaller than 0.015Å.
We also evaluated the interlayer distance and the energy difference between AA and AB stackings for 2LG
and graphite (Table II) due to the increasing importance
of studies in twisted bilayer graphene (t2LG) [13]. As
t2LG is composed by AA and AB domains the interlayer
distance an coupling strength between the layers varies
through this material [19].
Phonon frequencies are evaluated by using the method
of finite differences. Starting from the relaxed structure
in each case, displacements of the i-th sheet and in the µ
direction (µ = x, y or z) are applied and the forces on the
j-th sheet and ν direction (ν = x, y or z) are computed.
In this work, the evaluated optical modes correspond to
rigid displacements of the graphene sheets without any
internal displacements. Therefore, the corresponding frequencies are evaluated at the Γ point of the Brillouin
Zone, and they are shown in Fig. 4. Red dots are calculations using vdW-DF1-optb88 functional within the
harmonic approximation. Anharmonicity effects are also
taken into account by using first-order perturbation theory (see below) and the corresponding results are represented by black triangles. The remaining dots are experimental results (details are given in the figure caption). Wherever experimental results are avaiable, the
agreement between theory and experiment is quite good.
Therefore, it is safe to assume that our theoretical results
have good predictive power for the remaining cases.
The dashed lines in Fig. 4 are obtained by using
a model of interactions of equal magnitude between
nearest-neighbor layers in which our system is modeled
as N masses connected by N − 1 springs to compute the
frequencies of the LBM and shear modes. In this model,
the frequencies are given by [16, 20]

where i = 2, ..., N is the mode index, N is the number of layers and ωgraphite is the frequency of the corresponding mode in graphite. This equation can be used
to predict the frequencies of NLG from the corresponding graphite frequencies, as shown by the dashed lines
in Fig. 4. By using the average of available experimental data for graphite frequencies, we have plotted,
for clarity, only the curves corresponding to the upper
and lower branches of Eq. 7 (i = N and i = 2, respectively) [16, 17, 20]. For both modes, this simple analytical model shows good agreement with our calculated
results and available experimental data. This suggest
that it is a good approximation to consider only interactions between nearest-neighbor layers. Indeed, as a
by-product of our finite-difference phonon calculations,
we obtain the effective force constants between pairs of
layers for both normal (LBM) and tangential (shear) displacements. They are shown in Fig. 5 and one can notice
that, for all systems, the effective force constants between
nearest-neighbor layers is typically one order of magnitude larger than for second neighbors and beyond.
