We analyse transcriptional bursting within a stochastic non-equilibrium model which accounts
for the coupling between the dynamics of DNA supercoiling and gene transcription. We find a clear
signature of bursty transcription when there is a separation between the timescales of transcription
initiation and supercoiling dissipation – the latter may either be diffusive or mediated by topological
enzymes, such as type I or type II topoisomerases. In multigenic DNA domains we observe either
bursty transcription, or transcription waves; the type of behaviour can be selected for by controlling
gene activity and orientation. In the bursty phase, the statistics of supercoiling fluctuations at the
promoter are markedly non-Gaussian.

Introduction

Transcription, the mechanism through which DNA is
read by a polymerase to create a messenger RNA, is a
crucial process in living cells, and its regulation is an important determinant of cell function [1]. The dynamics of
transcription are inherently stochastic, since its initiation
requires an RNA polymerase (RNAP) and associated cofactors to bind at the promoter of a gene [2]. Not only
can the copy numbers of RNAPs and transcription factors be low, but the mechanism through which they find
their specific binding sites (a combination of 3D diffusion
through the nucleoplasm or cytoplasm, and 1D diffusion
along the genome [3, 4]) leads to a broad distribution of
search times. As a consequence, transcription initiation
is a rare event with rates of the order of inverse hours
in mammals [5], while in bacteria tens of minutes may
elapse between successive initiation events at the same
promoter [4].
An intriguing feature of transcription as a stochastic
process is that it is often “bursty”. This means that
when recording transcription events for a given gene
in a given cell, one observes clusters of closely spaced
events separated by longer dormant periods in which
the gene is silent, and the distribution of interval times
is non-Poissonian. Transcription bursts are common to
both bacterial and eukaryotic cells; this phenomenon is
thought to provide a potential basis for the variability in
behaviour which is observed in genetically identical cells
within the same environment [2]. Bursting may therefore
play a key role in the pathway through which a cell can
spontaneously break symmetry, for instance to choose its
fate early in development in higher eukaryotes [7].
From a general point of view, a dynamical system yields bursty behaviour when there is intermittent
switching between states with high and low activity [8, 9].
But what is the biophysical mechanism underlying such
intermittency? Several possibilities have been proposed
in the literature, and they may differ in different organisms. In mammals, proposed mechanisms for bursting are

typically gene-specific [10]; cycles of higher transcription
activity may be due to chromatin remodelling [11], or to
the action of cis-regulatory DNA elements [10]. In both
cases, refractory periods during which genes are silent
last for hours. In bacteria, refractory timescales only
span tens of minutes, and other scenarios may be more
relevant. For instance, pausing of an RNAP along a gene
may lead to the formation of a queue of multiple RNAPs
behind it, producing bursts of transcripts [12, 13]. This
mechanism requires that the gene in question is highly
expressed, so that multiple polymerases can be recruited
to its promoter within minutes. Recently, a set of experiments [5] has demonstrated that transcriptional bursts in
DNA plasmids in vitro are associated with DNA supercoiling [15], which is the extent of over or under-winding
of the two strands in a DNA double helix. Specifically,
it was shown that the build-up of positive supercoiling
(DNA over-twisting) stalls transcription, and the addition of gyrase (which relaxes this supercoiling) leads to
transcriptional bursts [5]. The conclusions of this work
are consistent with the hypothesis in the earlier ratebased theoretical model in Ref. [9], which suggested that
the timescales observed in bacterial bursts are compatible with supercoiling-dependent initiation.
Here we consider a stochastic model which couples
the dynamics of supercoiling and transcription in DNA
(first introduced in Ref. [1]), and ask whether, and under which conditions, supercoiling may lead to transcriptional bursts. Our main result is that supercoiling can induce bursts in a wide range of parameter space. Perhaps
surprisingly, bursts occur only when the overall transcriptional rate is low, and are absent when it is high. When
gene density is low (e.g., if we model a single gene), significant bursting is primarily found in the presence of topological enzymes which relax supercoiling at a fixed rate.
For higher gene density, highly significant bursts can also
arise in the absence of topoisomerases, through the action of a self-organised non-equilibrium regulatory network mediated by supercoiling. Intriguingly, this same
pathway can also generate transcription waves and upregulate divergent transcription, both of which eventually

2
disrupt the bursty behaviour. A final key finding is that
bursting leaves a detectable signature in the distribution
of supercoiling at the promoter – it leads to a non-normal
distribution, and the appearance of a singularity or small
peak in the tails of the distribution. Observation of such
signatures may be an aim of future experiments – along
the lines of existing ones, performed either in vitro [5] or
in vivo [17, 18].

cated at lattice positions yj , j = 1, . . . , n. Transcription
initiates stochastically when an inactive RNAP binds at
gene j with rate kin,j . The RNAP then elongates with velocity v (positive or negative depending on the direction
of transcription) such that at a time ti after initiating
it is located at position xi (ti ) = yj + vti (where the index i labels the RNAP). Transcription terminates (and
the promoter becomes again available for initiation) once
the RNAP reaches the end of a gene. The total flux is
then given by

Model

The key dynamical variable in our model is a onedimensional scalar field σ(x, t), which denotes the local
supercoiling density at a point x on the DNA. This is the
local analog of the global supercoiling density, defined as
(Lk − Lk0 )/Lk0 , with Lk and Lk0 respectively the linking number – which can be decomposed into twist and
writhe [15] – of a DNA molecule and that of a torsionally relaxed B-DNA, that is 1 for every 10.5 base pairs
(bp) [47] The dynamics are then described in continuous
space by

(1)
where the three terms on the right-hand side represent
diffusion of supercoiling, supercoiling flux generated by
transcription, and supercoiling dissipation due to topological enzymes. Below we will discuss each term in turn.
Though we have written Eq. (1) as continuous in space,
we solve it on a lattice of length L = 15 kbp with spacing
∆x = 15 bp (which is approximately the footprint size of
an RNAP).
If we consider a closed DNA loop, then in the absence
of topological enzymes the total level of supercoiling is
conserved (it is a topological invariant of the system).
Therefore we require that supercoiling obeys “model B”
(conserved) dynamics [19]. Further, the free energy density of supercoiling (twist and writhe) f is, to a good approximation, quadratic in the supercoiling density [1, 15];
so the chemical potential (∂f /∂σ) is linear in σ. Since
the flux in model B dynamics is proportional to the gradient of the chemical potential, this results in a diffusion
equation (when the mobility is constant) [1], giving the
first term on the right of Eq. (1). Single molecule measurements of the dynamics of plectonemic supercoils in
vitro [20] and studies of transcription in vivo [21] are also
consistent with a diffusive dynamics for supercoiling.
The second term in Eq. (1) represents supercoiling
fluxes due to transcription. Through this term we couple
the supercoiling dynamics to stochastic transcriptional
kinetics, where each of N RNAPs can bind at the promoters of n genes (each of size λ = 66∆x ∼ 1000bp) lo-

where the sum is over all RNAPs, Ji (ti ) is the flux generated by RNAP i, and the function ηi (t) represents its
state, taking a value of 0 if it is unbound, and 1 if it is
actively transcribing. The initiation dynamics is coupled
back to the supercoiling by making kin,j a function of the
supercoiling at the promoter,
kin,j (t) = k0 max {1 − ασ(xj , t), 0} ,

where α is a coupling parameter (it represents the sensitivity of RNAP-DNA binding to the level of supercoiling).
According to the twin supercoiling domains model [22],
a moving RNAP generates a supercoiling flux if its rotation is hindered, because as the enzyme progresses the
DNA has to locally unwind. [The rotational drag on the
RNAP in vivo is likely to be large in view of its size
and of its interactions with other macromolecules.] As a
result, positive supercoiling is generated in front of the
RNAP, and negative supercoiling behind. More specifically, as the RNAP moves, all the DNA twist in front of
it (minus any rotation of the RNAP if present) is pushed
forward. This reasoning suggests that the flux generated
will depend on the level of twist ahead of the RNAP,
which might in principle vary [12]. To obtain a tractable
model we assume though this flux to be constant. In
practice, this approximation is likely good as DNA can
only support small levels of twist before writhing [23].
A final complication is that diffusion of supercoils
through the RNAP also requires its rotation – hence,
we expect this effect to be small. We could prohibit
flux through the RNAPs by introducing no-flux boundary conditions at the points xi , but an alternative which
yields a more tractable model is to instead ramp up the
flux as transcription progresses; to do this we set

Ji (ti ) = J0 1 +
∆x
The sign of J0 depends on the direction of transcription.
Any residual net diffusive leak only plays a minor role, as
it is small compared to J0 . [Additionally, a small leak of
supercoiling may not be unrealistic even for a polymerase

3
acting as a topological barrier for twist, if the region of
DNA containing it writhes in 3D.] In what follows, we
define J¯ = J0 [1 + λ/(2∆x)] – this is a useful quantity as
it is the average value of the supercoiling flux generated
during a transcription event.
The third term on the right of Eq. (1) represent loss
of supercoiling due to the action of topoisomerases (such
as, e.g., topoI, topoII, gyrase). This is introduced in the
model in a minimal way, as a first-order reaction where
both positive and negative supercoiling relax at the same
rate ktopo . In general this term does not conserve the
total supercoiling; however here we start with a uniform
initial condition σ(x, t = 0) ≡ σ0 where σ0 = 0, so in this
case the total supercoiling is conserved.
This model was first described in Ref. [1]. In that work
¯
it was found that by increasing the ratio J/D
there is a
crossover from a relaxed regime where transcription is
virtually Poissonian, to a supercoiling-regulated regime
where transcription of neighbouring genes is highly correlated. In the present work we instead ask whether, and
under what conditions, the coupling between supercoiling
and transcription can lead to bursty dynamics.

Key model quantities and parameter values

Key quantities which control the model behaviour are
¯
the ratios J/D
and ktopo /k0 . In the results section below
we will explore the ability of the model to exhibit bursty
¯
behaviour at different points within the J/D–k
topo /ko
parameter space, for different gene arrangement cases.
Though the values which these quantities have in vivo
have not yet been well characterised experimentally, here
we discuss what ranges of values might be relevant based
on available evidence. For our simulations we vary several
parameters in order to get an understanding of how such
a system might behave under different conditions.
The diffusion constant for supercoiling is difficult to
measure – not least because one would expect very different values for twist and writhe. Intuitively one would
expect twist to diffuse very quickly [12], whereas writhe
diffusion will be much slower, since it requires more global
DNA rearrangements. Also, it has been shown that DNA
is unable to support much deviation of twist from its relaxed state: the theory in Ref. [23] (and Refs. therein)
indicate that it will writhe if the supercoiling density exceeds 0.01. This suggests that the slower diffusion of
writhe will dominate the dynamics. Single molecule experiments presented in Ref. [20], which measured the motion of plectonemes in a stretched DNA molecule, indeed
obtained a relatively small diffusion coefficient, with a
value significantly less than 1 kbp2 /s (see Fig. 3F in [20]).
Specifically, when a DNA molecule is subjected to tensions of less than 1–2 pN, plectoneme diffusivity is at
most ∼ 0.1 kbp2 /s. Taking this value, and a typical
size for a bacterial gene of λ ∼ 1 kbp, the time it takes

for supercoiling to diffuse away from the promoter after
transcription terminates is ∼ λ2 /(2D) ∼ 5 s. In vivo,
macromolecular crowding is likely to further slow down
writhe/supercoiling diffusion – so for our simulations we
consider values for D which are between ∼ 4 and ∼ 40
times smaller than the value quoted above. Specifically,
we consider D ∼ 2.25 × 10−2 kbp2 /s in Figure 1, and
D ∼ 2.25 × 10−3 kbp2 /s in other figures. Both values
allow the supercoiling generated during transcription of
a gene to dissipate in at most minutes after transcription
termination (the smaller value was used for the more systematic analyses as it enables more efficient simulations
– as it is possible to use a larger value for the time step).
The typical RNAP velocity in bacteria is ∼ 100
bp/s [1], so that the time taken to transcribe a λ = 1 kbp
gene is τ ∼ λ/v ∼ 10 s. Then, through dimensional analysis, we expect an order-of-magnitude estimate for the J¯
to be ∼ λ2 /τ or vλ ∼ 0.1 kbp2 /s – notably, this is the
same order of magnitude as D. Thus in our simulations
¯
we explore a range of values for J/D
which is typically
between 0.34 and 3.4.
Turning now to the dynamics of transcription initiation, measured RNAP initiation rate can vary widely,
and typical values are in the range 1 s−1 to 1 hr−1 are
observed (see [1, 24–26]). Likewise the number of RNAPs
has a large variability. For example in the bacteria E. coli
there are an estimated 1000–10000 RNAP per cell [27],
and about 5000 genes. To reflect this ratio, we take
one RNAP per gene in our simulations, unless otherwise
stated (see Supporting Material, Fig. S4). The rate of
topoisomerase action in vivo is equally difficult to estimate. Ref. [28] counts ∼ 500 topoisomerase I per cell
in E. coli. Assuming that about half enzyme are bound,
and that there are two genomes per cell on average, we
arrive at ∼ 100 topoisomerase proteins are bound per
genome, or 0.02 per gene. Assuming additionally that
each enzyme can on average relax 1–10 supercoil per second [29], and that the baseline bacterial supercoiling is
equal to −0.05, we get ktopo ∼ 0.005–0.05 s−1 . We note
this rough estimate is within the physiological value of
the baseline transcriptional rate (in our simulations k0 ).
Due to this, and since the values of ktopo and k0 are not
known accurately, in our simulations we have systematically varied their ratio ktopo /k0 , between 0 and 1.4.
[Specifically we set k0 = 0.001 s−1 , and varied ktopo .] In
this way we can examine all possible scenarios concerning
the balance between initiation and topoisomerase relaxation rates.
To determine whether supercoiling can affect RNAP
initiation at a promoter, we need to consider the time it
takes for supercoiling generated by a previous transcription event to diffuse away, and the typical initiation rate
(kin,j in our model). In Ref. [1] a mean field model was
used to estimate the extent of residual supercoiling at the

4

If this quantity is larger than α−1 (see Eq. (3) for the
definition of α), then supercoiling can indeed increase
the rate at which RNAP binds the promoter, leading
to a positive feedback. Experiments in bacterial genes
suggest that a supercoiling density of σp ≤ −0.01 is sufficient to enhance RNAP binding (see [1, 30, 31]), so in
our simulations we have set α = 100. These considera¯
tions explain why J/D
and kin τ are key dimensionless
quantities in our model.
In what follows we give parameter values either in
physical units, or in terms of dimensionless ratios. When
required, the physical values of all parameters can be reconstructed by referring back to this section. As noted
above, to solve Eq. (1) numerically we discretise space
into a lattice with 15 bp spacing; we discretise time into
steps of between 0.1–1 s, chosen to balance efficiency and
numerical stability (which depends on the other parameters).

The sequence-size function

A classic model to describe transcriptional bursting is
the interrupted Poisson process (IPP) [2] (see Supporting Material, Section II), which describes transitions between an active (ON) and an inactive (OFF) state with
Poissonian rates kON and kOFF , as in a random telegraph
process [8], together with transcription at a constant rate
ki whilst the system is in the ON state. The process can
be characterised by the probability distribution function
(pdf ) f (t) of waiting times – the time intervals between
two consecutive transcriptional events – which is given
by a double-exponential [2], where the two characteristic
times are related to the interval between transcriptions in
a single burst, and the interval between two consecutive
bursts (see Supporting Material, Eqs. (S10)–(S13)).
To determine whether our system is bursty for a given
¯
set of parameters (J/D
and ktopo /k0 ) we measure the
distribution f (t). We then analyse the so-called sequencesize function (ssf ) [2, 3], which is defined in terms of f (t)
as
Φ(τ ) =

This is the inverse of the probability of observing a waiting time larger than τ , or, equivalently, the proportion of
transcriptional event intervals which are longer than τ .
If the dynamics is bursty, we expect two well-separated
timescales for the decay of f (t); correspondingly Φ will
display a plateau and two inflection points. These points,
τ1 and τ2 > τ1 , can be found as the zeros in the second

derivative of Φ; these values also approximate the two
timescales for f (t) (this is not a strict equality, but rather
an order-of-magnitude estimate). The value of Φ in the
middle of the plateau, (Φ(τx ) = (Φ(τ1 ) + Φ(τ2 ))/2), then
yields the average number of transcriptional events in a
burst, or burst size, β [2]. If the dynamics is not bursty, Φ
will have no more than one inflection point. An analysis
of f (t) and Φ(t) shows that these criteria work qualitatively well for our model. For sufficiently large values of
ktopo , we find that the dynamics is indeed bursty (Fig. 1):
f (t) has two characteristic timescales (Fig. 1b), and Φ(τ )
has two well defined inflection points (Fig. 1c). For small
ktopo and high values of the flux, there are no well defined
timescales in f (t) or inflection points in Φ(τ ); inspection
of the transcriptional dynamics show this is not bursty
(see Supporting Material, Fig. S3c).

series, we define the following parameter,

We first consider the case of a single gene. By com¯
puting ξ from simulations with different values of J/D
and ktopo /k0 we find two distinct regimes (Fig. 2a): the
non-bursty regime, identified by ξ = 0, and the bursty
regime, for ξ > 0 (a mean field theory gives a good prediction of the boundary between the two). In the most
¯
significant region (ktopo /k0 ∼ 1.4, J/D
∼ 1.5) the burst
size is between 2 and 3, close to that measured in E.
coli in vivo [4]. Estimates of the other bursts parameters – burst duration and OFF-state duration – are given
in the Supporting Material, Section III, and are also in
good agreement with experimental results [4, 5]. We note
though that the burst size depends on the model parameters: the system can produce bursts of significantly more
than 2–3 events (at most ∼ 10 on average in our simulations). However, this only occurs in the transition region
between the non-bursty and bursty regimes (see Supporting Material, Fig. S2a). In this transition region, burst
significance is smaller, which means that the separation
between timescales is less marked.
The results in Figure 2a also show that when the positive feedback between supercoil generation and transcrip¯
tion initiation is strong (for large J/D
and ktopo = 0,
identified as the supercoiling-regulated regime of Ref. [1]),
the dynamics are never bursty; bursts are most significant
when this feedback is much weaker (but non-zero). The
reason for this seemingly surprising result is that if supercoiling upregulates transcription too much, the gene
is essentially always on and the transcriptionally silent
state is absent (see Fig. S3c in Supporting Material).
Our results show that topoisomerases action favours
burstiness. In other words, although the dynamics can
be bursty for ktopo = 0, burst significance is larger when
ktopo 6= 0.
As bursting is generally due to switching back and
forth between two transiently stable states, it is natural
to ask whether there are any signatures of bistability in
the stochastic transcriptional process we simulate. As we
show in Fig. 2b, one such signature can be obtained from
moments of the distribution of supercoiling at the promoter σp . For non-bursty behaviour, σp exhibits close-toGaussian fluctuations about an average value (see Supporting Material, Fig. S3b). For bursty transcription,
this distribution is more markedly non-Gaussian and
bistable (see Supporting Material, Fig. S3a). Quantitatively, burst significance correlates with the magnitude of

Multiple genes

The single gene case considered above is an important starting point for our model, and could be relevant
to the experimental investigation in Ref. [4] where the
transcription of a gene on a bacterial plasmid was monitored. However, it is also of interest to consider the case
of multiple genes. This is because gene density is variable
both across organisms and within genomes: for instance,
in both yeast and bacteria gene density is high so that
transcription is likely to affect neighbouring genes. This
is also relevant for understanding synthetic DNA constructs containing multiple genes, which can be used in
biotechnology applications. In this Section, we study the
burstiness in arrays of multiple genes without topoisomerases (i.e. ktopo = 0).
In Figure 3 we consider the supercoiling-coupled transcriptional dynamics within an array of genes which have
the same orientation (we refer to these as “tandem”
genes). We find that bursts are typically more significant than in the single gene case. For instance, for
¯
J/D
= 1 and ktopo = 0, the single gene case was only
weakly bursty (ξ ∼ 0.23, burst size ∼ 1.53 and duration
∼ 100 s, see Fig. S2 in the Supporting Material), whereas
for an array of 10 tandem genes the same parameters
give rise to bursting which is around twice as significant
(ξ ∼ 0.4–0.5 for the most bursty genes, burst size ∼ 2 and
duration ∼ 3–4 min, see Fig. S7 in the Supporting Material). This is because transcription generates positive
supercoils ahead of a gene, which act to down-regulate
its downstream – right – neighbour (whilst upregulating the upstream – left – neighbour). As a result, some

tively). ξ is zero when the dynamics are not bursty, and
increases as the separation between the two characteristic timescales τ1 and τ2 becomes clearer: we refer to this
parameter as the burst significance.

genes may be transiently “switched off” – this can be appreciated, for instance, by inspecting the time series of
supercoiling at the promoter, which at times can take sufficiently positive values such that kin (t) = 0, see Fig. S5a
in the Supporting Material. Just as in the case of a single gene with ktopo 6= 0, the activity of each gene is effectively described by a two-state dynamics (ON↔OFF),
and bursts can occur (Fig. 3a). As expected, the pdf of
waiting times is well described by a double-exponential
(see Fig. 3b), and Φ00 (τ ) displays two zeros (see Inset

bursting does not occur for large values of J/D.
In this
regime, the supercoiling-mediated intergenic interactions
instead give rise to transcription waves which travel in
the opposite direction to transcription (Fig. 3c,d). Transcription waves arise because transcription of a gene upregulates its upstream – left – neighbour [1]: as a consequence, transcription of gene i is followed by that of gene

i−1, then i−2 and so on. We find that the wave velocity
is v ∼ D/l, independent of k0 (Fig. 4, inset; l = 100∆x
is the mean separation between promoters in our simulations).Given our parameter choice, the wave speed is
between 0.5–3.0 bp/s, and the time needed to trigger
activity of the neighbouring upstream gene is between
6–12 minutes. The scaling of v can be understood by assuming that supercoiling propagates diffusively over the
distance l between a gene and its upstream neighbour –
simulations show that the prefactor in this relationship is
slightly larger than 1. When in the “wavy” regime, the
system can no longer be mapped onto a telegraph-like
process, and bursts are no longer observed (accordingly
ξ = 0, as Φ(t) does not have two inflection points, see
Fig. 3d).
Transcription waves only arise for arrays of tandem
genes, and do not occur (or do so only transiently) for
genes of differing orientation. In that case transcriptiongenerated supercoiling upregulates pairs of divergent
genes at the expense of other (convergent or tandem)
genes which are down-regulated [1]: this renders the situation qualitatively closer to that of a single gene (see
Supporting Material, Section IV). For either kind of gene
orientation, burstiness is gene-dependent, and the values
of ξ for different genes are substantially different from
¯
each other (Fig. 5). Note that even for small J/D
some
genes are slightly upregulated than others (as shown in
the kymograph in Fig. 3a), due to the particular position
in the array. We find that ξ is anticorrelated with the

overall transcription rate, so that the genes which are
expressed more (e.g. genes 1, 6 and 10 in the tandem
setup or genes 5 and 6 in the divergent setup, see Fig. 5a
and Supporting Material, respectively Figs. S6 and S9a)
are less bursty (Fig. 6a). Burst size is also different in
the tandem and bidirectional setups, being substantially
smaller in the latter case (β <
∼ 2, see Fig. S7a in the
Supporting Material). Burst sizes measured experimentally in E. Coli [4] are closer to the value for single or
tandem genes (β ' 2.2) – this is reasonable, as they refer
to the transcription of operons which are normally made
up from tandem genes controlled by a single promoter.
An analysis of the distribution of supercoiling values at
the promoter shows that these differ qualitatively for the
cases of multiple genes and a single gene (e.g., compare
Fig. 6 with Fig. S3). Unlike in the single gene case, the
non-Gaussian parameters for the distribution of supercoiling at the promoter now only weakly correlate with
the burst significance (see Supporting Material, Fig. S8).
This is because the supercoiling-mediated interaction between genes give rise to non-Gaussian fluctuations even
for non-bursty genes. Nevertheless, for both the tandem
and divergent gene cases, bursting leaves a detectable
signature in the tails of the distribution.
For the bursty transcription case, there is a singularity
or a bump, while for non-bursty transcription the curve is
smooth, as shown in Figure 6b for a divergent geometry
and in Figure 6c for a tandem array. The singular point
is located at σp ≈ (1 − (k0 τx )−1 )/α, where τx = (τ1 +
τ2 )/2. We note that similar changes in the behaviour
of large fluctuations were linked to phase transitions in
other systems [34, 35].

Conclusions

In summary, we have studied the occurrence of
transcriptional bursts in a non-equilibrium model for
supercoiling-regulated transcription, first introduced in
Ref. [1]. For an isolated gene, we found that significant
bursting occurs primarily in the presence of topological
enzymes which relax positive and negative supercoiling.
This is qualitatively consistent with experimental evidence that bursts in E. coli arise due to the action of
the DNA gyrase enzyme, which can relax positive supercoiling [5]. It is interesting to note that in the region of
parameter space where bursts are most significant, the
properties of the bursts generated in the model (size, duration and inter-burst time) match well those found in
bacteria in vivo [4]. Notably, topoisomerase action is not
required for highly significant bursting in gene clusters, as
there supercoiling can mediate transient inhibition of the
neighbours of highly active genes. We considered both
tandem and bidirectional gene geometries, which could
be recreated synthetically using plasmids of selected sequence in the presence of the transcriptional machinery.
We found that the existence of bursting is intimately

8
linked to the nature of fluctuations of supercoiling at gene
promoters: bursting becomes most significant when these
are strongly non-Gaussian. It would be of interest to look
for such effects in experiments with populations of synthetic DNA loops, where psoralen binding [17, 18] might
in principle be used to monitor averages and distributions
of supercoiling along the DNA.
Whilst additional ingredients may be required to understand transcriptional bursts in eukaryotes, where
stochastic promoter-enhancer interactions or other regulatory processes are known to play a key role [2, 13, 36],
our current results uncover a possible mechanism for
transcriptional bursts in bacteria, based on the interplay
between transcription initiation, supercoiling and topological enzymes. Our results are consistent with the work
in Ref. [9], which identified supercoiling as one potential
mechanism for bursting based on comparison between
experimental data and simplified kinetic model – in our
case, we consider a full stochastic dynamics for supercoiling and elucidate the role of topoisomerases. As discussed
in the introduction, a related study [12] instead analysed
the interplay between supercoiling and transcriptional
elongation, providing a complementary mechanism to the
one identified here; that model may be particularly relevant for the case of ribosomal genes where expression is
extremely high, whereas the present work concerns more
moderate expression where there is not significantly more
than one polymerase transcribing the same gene at once.

MEAN FIELD THEORY

Here, we develop a mean field theory with some improvements with respect to our previous work [1]. In particular
we solve the mean field ordinary differential equation (ODE) with periodic boundary conditions (instead of open
boundary conditions, as previously done) and in the presence of topoisomerases.
We consider the case N = n = 1, where N is the number of RNAP and n is the number of genes. Besides, we
consider a static polymerase (i.e. v = 0) at the lattice position x = 0. If L is the length of the lattice, we assume
boundary conditions σ(0) = 0 and σ(L/2) = σ(−L/2). In steady state (∂σ/∂t = 0), Eq. (1) reads:
∂ 2 σ(x) J0 kin τ ∂δ(x) ktopo

(S2)

with kin τ /(kin τ + 1) the fraction of time the system spends in the transcribing state.
As the flux term acts only at x = 0, solving the model in the mean field approximation is equivalent to solving the
following ODE:

x 6= 0
(S3)

Since both σ(x) and σ(−x) are solution of the ODE for x 6= 0 the unique solution of Eq. (S3) is a linear combination
of σ(x) and σ(−x). It can be shown that only the antisymmetric combination fulfils the periodic boundary conditions,
with σ(L/2) = σ(−L/2) = 0.
The solution of Eq. (S3) with the appropriate parity and boundary conditions is given by:

The validity of this mean field theory can be determined by comparing it to the time-average supercoiling profile
in our single gene simulations.
Interestingly, from our simulations we found that the point along the gene at which the time-averaged supercoiling
profile crosses zero is ∼ 2λ/3, independently of the parameter used. The correct mean field profile of supercoiling for
a moving polymerase is then computed by substituting |x| → |x − 2λ/3|.

THE MODIFIED IPP PROCESS

The mechanism which leads to bursty dynamics for transcription in living cells is still not well understood, though
several hypothesis have been made. In our model, we have seen that both the action of topoisomerases (1-gene
model) and the interaction among genes (10-gene model) can yield bursts, in absence of external factors. The
nontrivial nonlinear behaviour predicted by our model can be captured by a simpler kinetic scheme: the Interrupted
Poisson Process (IPP ). By solving the IPP equations, one can explicitly obtain the double-exponential distribution
of waiting times between events, that, when appropriate conditions on the kinetics rates are met, leads to bursting.
In this section we modify the IPP equations. Nevertheless, the resulting distribution is still a double-exponential (see
below), with the exception of the two timescales, which are different from those found in [2].
We define (as in Fig. 1a of the main text) an active (ON , or  = 1) and an inactive (OF F , or  = 0) state of the gene
promoter according to the local supercoiling density (i.e., if the supercoiling density is below (1 − (k0 τ2 )−1 )/α, then
the promoter is ON ). We then associate the rates kOF F and kON with the ON → OF F and OF F → ON transitions
respectively. The gene oscillates between the two states, tracking the typical trajectories of a Random Telegraph
Process (see Fig. 1a, BOTTOM). Whilst in the ON state, the gene is able to transcribe with rate ki . Given a time
series of events, the waiting time tn is the elapsed time between two consecutive transcriptions, say the (n − 1)-th
and the n-th. In the IPP, the waiting time tn is drawn by the same probability distribution function (pdf ) for each
n (this may not be true in general in our stochastic model for supercoiling-dependent transcription). Moreover, in
the standard IPP prescription the OF F → ON transition occurs between states labelled by the same n, see Ref. [2].
Differently, in our modified IPP description, the transition OF F → ON is triggered by transcription (see Fig. S1),
meaning that the transition and the first event in the burst occur at the same time. By labelling possible states with
the instantaneous value of  (gene ON/OFF) and by the index n, which keeps count of the number of transcriptions,
we denote the probability of being in the state {n, } at time t by pn, (t). Then, the set of master equations for our
modified IPP is:

with the initial condition p1,1 (t = 0) = 1. Clearly, the pdf associated with the first transcription event after initialisation (n = 2) corresponds to the distribution of waiting times, that is
f (t) = ki p1,1 (t) + kON p1,0 (t).

(S8)

In order to find p1,1 (t) and p1,0 (t), and therefore f (t), we need to solve just the following two first order coupled

In our stochastic model used in the main text, we can identify kON ∼ k0 . Conversely, it is not easy to find a value
for the rate kOF F without fitting the data, since the transition ON → OF F is mainly due to fluctuations, that, in
the bursty phase, relax the system towards the initial value of the supercoiling σ0 .

1-GENE ARRAY: BURST PARAMETERS AND ADDITIONAL FIGURES

In our work we use the sequence-size function, Φ(τ ), to analyse burst significance. Although this method has been
presented in previous works [2, 3], it has not previously been applied to simulation of the dynamics of transcription
which does not use predetermined kinetic rates for the process.
We use the parameter ξ as defined in Eq. (7) in the main tex, which is different from the parameter proposed in
[2], (τ2 − τ1 )/τ2 . Indeed, the former parameter does show variation within the bursty phase, whereas the latter does
not. Our parameter ξ yields a reasonable estimate of burst significance, as (i) it is still proportional to τ2 − τ1 and

4
(ii) it fulfils the intuitive expectation that the burst significance should decrease if the system spends more time in
intermediate states, at fixed τ2 − τ1 .
The analysis of the ssf allows us to readily compute other relevant burst parameters in a relatively simple way.
The time separation between the two timescales is just τx = (τ1 + τ2 )/2 and, from the definition of the ssf, we can
estimate the mean burst size (the average number of transcriptions in a single burst) as β = Φ(τx ). This is a useful
parameter, since it provides a simple basis to compare with experimental data. As we can see from Fig. S2 higher
values of β (β > 4 − 5) correspond to less significant bursting (see main text, Fig. 2). Conversely, in the region of
¯
higher ξ (J/D
∼ 1.5 − 2), the burst size β ' 2.2 is short and close to that experimentally observed in E. Coli [4]. The
burst duration – i.e. the time duration of a single burst – is estimated by βτx : in the same parameter region it is also
consistent with experimental results [4, 5], T ∼ 3 − 4 min.
In Fig. S3a,b we present the typical probability distribution of supercoiling at the promoter, respectively in the
bursty and non-bursty phases. Within our stochastic model, the supercoiling at the promoter is directly linked to the
probability of initiation, and therefore its distribution encodes all of the information about the process. As expected,
for bursty dynamics we observe a bimodal distribution of σp , while for non-bursty dynamics we have a unimodal
distribution, with fluctuations approximately Gaussian.
For completeness, in Fig. S4 we consider a situation where there is a single gene but three polymerases. The rationale
is that in vivo, at any given time, there can be more than one polymerase available for a given gene, even if the ratio
of the total number of RNAP and genes is small. In this multiple polymerase case we find qualitatively similar results
to the single polymerase case treated in the text, but only if we increase ktopo by a factor of 10. However, the burst
significance is remarkably smaller than the case studied in the main text. Nevertheless, the physical features of the
¯
bursts are consistent with those of the single polymerase case: e.g., for J/D
∼ 1 we find β ∼ 3 and T ∼ 2 min.

to highlight the region of higher burst significance (J/D ∼ 1.5 − 2), in which β is in agreement with experimental measurement
of the same parameter [4]. (b) Duration of bursts T . We find that in the same region the duration of bursts is also consistent
with [4], as T ∼ 3 − 4 min.

FIG. S3: Probability distribution for supercoiling at the promoter. (a) In the bursty phase, supercoiling at the
promoter is strongly peaked at σp ∼ 0. Another peak appears for more negative value of supercoiling, due to occupation of the
ON state. Inset: log-linear plot of the pdf in the main panel. (b) In the non-bursty phase the distribution is unimodal, with
one gaussian tail. The gene tends to more often be in a state with less negative supercoiling for longer time; this results in a
non-gaussian positive tail, with a nonzero kurtosis (see main text). (c) Time profile of the supercoiling at the promoter in the
non-bursty regime. Clearly, the gene is always ON , as the supercoiling does not relax to the initial value σ0 = 0.

region of very high values (not biologically relevant) for both the burst size and the duration. However, these correspond to a
region of low burst significance; in the region where burst significance is maximal we again find values for β and T consistent
with experiments (β ∼ 3, T ∼ 2 min).

MULTIPLE GENE SIMULATIONS: ADDITIONAL FIGURES

We present some additional results from the 10-gene array simulations for the case ktopo = 0, for which the main
results are presented in the main text.
In the case of tandem genes, for the configuration shown in the main text (see Fig. 5a) the genes 1, 6 and 10 are
upregulated by supercoiling. These genes have a larger space upstream of them, so are less affected by the repressive
action of positive supercoils generated at their upstream neighbour. This occurs, albeit to a much lesser extent, even
in the relaxed regime. This relatively small upregulation is sufficient to yield a sizeable change in the burst significance
(see main text, Fig. 5b).

FIG. S5: Supercoiling dynamics at the promoter gene 4 in a 10-gene array. (a) Promoter supercoiling versus time
¯
in the bursty regime. For J/D
sufficiently small correlation between neighbours genes are established. Positive supercoiling
produced by gene 3 transcription often freezes gene 4, yielding the supercoiling value transiently to the absorbing state (σ0 =
0.01, kin = 0). (b) Promoter supercoiling versus time in the supercoiling-regulated regime. In this regime the correlation
spreads through the whole lattice, creating a transcription wave. Supercoiling at the promoter now oscillates in time.

In Fig. S5a we show a typical time series for the supercoiling at the promoter of the gene 4 (which is not upregulated),
¯
when the burst significance is high (J/D
= 0.68, that is in the bursty transcriptional regime). In Fig. S5b we show
the supercoiling time series in the wavy regime: a periodic pattern appears so that the dynamics is no longer bursty.
In Figure Fig. S6 we show the probability of transcription for each gene, in the bursty regime, for two different values
¯
of the flux J/D.
In Fig. S7 we show the mean size of bursts β and the duration of bursts T for simulations of tandem genes. Even
in this case we have a good agreement with the results for a single gene. Indeed we find that in the region of higher
burst significance we have β >
∼ 2 and T ∼ 4 − 5 min.
For completeness, in Fig. S8 we show the non-Gaussian parameters for the distribution of the supercoiling at the
promoter σp , already computed for a single gene in the main text. The skewness and the kurtosis are not wellcorrelated to the burst significance, and the values depend strongly on the particular gene considered in a given
configuration. However, for each gene individually, the skewness/kurtosis displays a decreasing/increasing trend as a
function of ξ.
In arrays with a pair of divergent genes, the transcription probability for different genes starts to differ as soon as
the value of the flux is large enough to give rise to supercoiling mediated interaction (positive feedback loop) between
the two divergent genes, Fig. S9a. As a consequence, the burst significance ξ also differs among the genes. Since for

8
¯
high value of the flux (J/D
∼ 1) the transcription across all genes is almost totally dominated by the pair of divergent
genes, we find that the latter behave like a single upregulated gene. This can be seen by looking at the distribution
of waiting times of one of the two genes (Fig. S9b), which clearly does not display two separate timescales.
As for the tandem setup, we show the burst parameters β and T in the presence of a pair of divergent genes (genes
¯
5 and 6, see Fig. S10). We note that the size of bursts is barely greater than 2 for high values of J/D,
since bursty
genes are strongly down-regulated.
