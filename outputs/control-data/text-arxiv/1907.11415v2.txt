CRYSTAL STRUCTURES FOR CANONICAL GROTHENDIECK
FUNCTIONS
GRAHAM HAWKES AND TRAVIS SCRIMSHAW
Abstract. We give a Uq (sln )-crystal structure on multiset-valued tableaux,
hook-valued tableaux, and valued-set tableaux, whose generating functions
are the weak symmetric, canonical, and dual weak symmetric Grothendieck
functions, respectively. We show the result is isomorphic to a (generally infinite) direct sum of highest weight crystals, and for multiset-valued tableaux
and valued-set tableaux, we provide an explicit bijection. As a consequence,
these generating functions are Schur positive; in particular, the canonical
Grothendieck functions, which was not previously known. We also give an
extension of Hecke insertion to express a dual stable Grothendieck function as
a sum of Schur functions.

1. Introduction
The Grassmannian Gr(n, k) is the set of k-dimensional hyperplanes in Cn . Lascoux and Schützenberger [LS82, LS83] introduced Grothendieck polynomials to
represent the K-theory ring of the Grassmannian. In particular, they correspond
to the K-theory classes of structure sheaves of Schubert varieties, and so they are
indexed by permutations in Sn . By taking the stable limit of n → ∞, Fomin and
Kirillov [FK94, FK96] initiated the study of stable Grothendieck functions, where
they also replaced the sign corresponding to the degree by a parameter β (which
corresponds to taking the connective K-theory [Hud14]). Stable Grothendieck functions have been well-studied using a variety of methods; see for example [BKS+ 08,
BM12, BS16, Buc02, GMP+ 16, IIM18, IN09, IS14, Iwa19, LP07, Len00, Mon16,
MS13, MS14, MPS18, MPS19, PP16, PS19b, PS19a, PY17, PY19, TY09, WZJ17]
and references therein.
The subset of stable Grothendieck functions corresponding to Grassmannian
permutations are called symmetric Grothendieck functions and form a basis for (an
appropriate completion of) the ring of symmetric functions over Z[β]. Recall that
Schur functions correspond to the characters of the general-linear Lie algebra gln
when restricted to n variables. Symmetric Grothendieck functions Gλ are known
to be Schur positive [Len00] with a finite expansion in each degree β, and so we can
apply the involution ω that sends a Schur function sµ to the Schur function sµ′ of
the conjugate µ′ of µ. The resulting basis is known as the weak stable Grothendieck
functions Jλ . Since the basis of Grothendieck functions is a (upper) filtered basis,
we can consider its Hopf dual basis under the Hall inner product, which can be
defined by considering Schur functions as an orthonormal basis, called the dual

symmetric Grothendieck functions and denoted by gλ . By also applying ω, we
obtain the dual weak symmetric Grothendieck functions jλ . Furthermore, each of
the above families are known to have combinatorial interpretations:
•
•
•
•

symmetric Grothendieck functions using set-valued tableaux,
weak symmetric Grothendieck functions using multiset-valued tableaux,
dual symmetric Grothendieck functions using reverse plane partitions, and
dual weak symmetric Grothendieck polynomials using valued-set tableaux.

In an effort to unify the bases {Gλ }λ and {Jλ }λ by constructing a basis invariant
under ω, Yeliussizov introduced in [Yel17] the canonical Grothendieck functions Hλ
and fused the corresponding combinatorics in hook-valued tableaux. Furthermore,
up to a coefficient of (α + β), the canonical Grothendieck functions have the same
structure coefficients and coproduct as the symmetric Grothendeick functions. Similarly, he defined the dual canonical Grothendieck functions as the corresponding
dual basis and described it combinatorially using rim border tableaux and showed
they are Schur positive.
Since a Schur function restricted to n variables is a character of the special-linear
Lie algebra sln , a generating function of some set B that is Schur positive implies
that there should be a Uq (sln )-crystal structure [Kas90, Kas91] on B with each
connected component isomorphic to the highest weight crystal B(λ) for every sλ
summand. Indeed, this was done for symmetric Grothendieck functions [MPS18]
and for dual symmetric Grothendieck functions [Gal17]. Thus, a natural question
is to construct such crystals on multiset-valued tableaux, hook-valued tableaux,
valued-set tableaux, and rim border tableaux. In this paper, we construct such a
Uq (sln )-crystal structure on the first three combinatorial objects: multiset-valued
tableaux, hook-valued tableaux, and valued-set tableaux.
Furthermore, we show that multiset-valued tableaux have many analogous results from [MPS18] for set-valued tableaux. More specifically, we extend the notion
of the uncrowding crystal isomorphism from [Buc02, Sec. 6] to an explicit crystal isomorphism from mutliset-valued tableaux to the usual crystal on semistandard tableaux. Furthermore, we extend Hecke insertion [BKS+ 08] to give a crystal
structure on weakly decreasing factorizations and give a positive Schur expansion
of general weak stable Grothendieck functions. We also have chosen our reading
word on multiset-valued tableaux so that it is a crystal embedding.
Conversely, whenever we have a crystal structure on a set B, the corresponding
generating function is Schur positive. Our final result is constructing a Uq (sln )crystal structure on hook-valued tableaux, which immediately implies that the
canonical Grothendieck functions are Schur positive. It was not previously known
that the canonical Grothendieck functions are Schur positive.
Our crystal structure on hook-valued tableaux is a combination of the crystal
structures on set-valued tableaux and multiset-valued tableaux. However, we are
not able to provide an explicit isomorphism with a highest weight crystal and
instead must rely on the Stembridge axioms [Ste03]. Indeed, the set-valued (resp.
multset-valued) tableaux crystal structure preserves rows (resp. columns), each of
which is isomorphic to hook shape, and so the crystal structures are incompatible
with no straightforward extension of uncrowding.
In addition to the crystal structure on valued-set tableaux (which we describe
using two different reading words), we provide an analog of uncrowding that we call
inflation. That is we give an explicit crystal isomorphism from valued-set tableaux

CRYSTAL STRUCTURES FOR CANONICAL GROTHENDIECKS

to the usual crystal on semistandard tableaux that is based on [LP07, Thm. 9.8].
As with uncrowding, inflation is based on the Robinson–Schensted–Knuth (RSK)
algorithm being a crystal isomorphism and recording the difference between the
shapes.
Since dual canonical Grothendieck are Schur positive [Yel17, Thm. 9.8], there
should exist a Uq (sln )-crystal structure on rim border tableaux with an additional
marking of all interior boxes by either α or β as the exponent of (α+β) corresponds
to the number of interior boxes. However, the crystal structure appears to be
more complicated than simply combining the crystal structures on reverse plane
partitions and valued-set tableaux. Thus, it remains an open problem to construct
a Uq (sln )-crystal on marked rim border tableaux. Moreover, it is unlikely that
inflation will extend to marked rim border tableaux.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide the necessary background. In Section 3, we give a crystal structure on multiset-valued tableaux, the
uncrowding map, and a variation of Hecke insertion for weak stable Grothendieck
polynomials. In Section 4, we construct a crystal structure on hook-valued tableaux.
In Section 5, we construct a crystal structure on valued-set tableaux and give the
inflation map.

2. Background
In this section, we give the necessary background on the crystal structure on setvalued tableaux and on (weak) symmetric/canonical Grothendieck functions. We
use English convention for partitions and tableaux. Let x = (x1 , x2 , x3 , . . .) be a
countable sequence of indeterminants. Let sln denote the special linear Lie algebra
(i.e., the simple Lie algebra of type An−1 ) over C and Uq (sln ) the corresponding
Drinfel’d–Jimbo quantum group. Let λ = (λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λℓ ) be a partition; a sequence
of weakly decreasing positive integers. Let ℓ(λ) = ℓ denote the length of λ.
2.1. Semistandard tableaux, set-valued tableaux, and crystals. A (semistandard) set-valued tableau of shape λ is a filling T of the boxes of Young diagram
of λ by finite nonempty sets of positive integers so that rows are weakly increasing
and columns are strictly increasing in the following sense: For every set A to the
left of a set B in the same row, we have max A ≤ min B, and for C below A in
the same column, we have max A < min C. A set-valued tableau is a semistandard
(Young) tableau if all sets have size 1. Let SVTn (λ) (resp. SSTn (λ)) denote the set
of set-valued (resp. semistandard) tableaux of shape λ with entries at most n.
In [MPS18], a Uq (sln )-crystal structure, in the sense of Kashiwara [Kas90, Kas91],
was given on SVTn (λ). Recalling this crystal structure, we begin with the crystal
operators ei , fi : SVTn (λ) → SVTn (λ) ⊔ {0}, where i ∈ I := {1, . . . , n − 1}.
Definition 2.1. Fix some T ∈ SVTn (λ) and i ∈ I. Write + above each column of
T containing i but not i + 1, and write − above each column containing i + 1 but
not i. Next cancel signs in ordered pairs −+ until obtaining a sequence of the form
+ · · · +− · · · − called the i-signature.

ei T : If there is not a − in the resulting sequence, then ei T = 0. Otherwise let
b correspond to the box of the leftmost uncanceled −. Then ei T is given
by one of the following:
• if there exists a box b← immediately to the left of b that contains an
i + 1, then remove the i + 1 from b← and add an i to b;
• otherwise replace the i + 1 in b with an i.
fi T : If there is not a + in the resulting sequence, then fi T = 0. Otherwise let
b correspond to the box of the rightmost uncanceled +. Then fi T is given
by one of the following:
• if there exists a box b→ immediately to the right of b that contains an
i, then remove the i from b→ and add an i + 1 to b;
• otherwise replace the i in b with an i + 1.
For a set-valued tableau T ∈ SVTn (λ) the weight is defined as
mn
1 m2
wt(T ) := xm
1 x2 · · · xn ,

(2.1)

where mi is the number of occurrences of i in T . Denote |T | :=
the statistics
εi (T ) = max{k ∈ Z≥0 | eki T 6= 0},

Pn

i=1

mi . Define

ϕi (T ) = max{k ∈ Z≥0 | fik T 6= 0}.

This gives a Uq (sln )-crystal structure on SVTn (λ).1 In particular, for T, T ′ ∈
SVTn (λ), we have
ei T = T ′ ⇐⇒ T = fi T ′ .
We say a T ∈ SVTn (λ) is highest weight if ei T = 0 for all i ∈ i. For more details
on crystals, we refer the reader to [BS17, Kas91].
When we restrict this crystal structure to semistandard Young tableaux of shape
λ, we exactly recover the crystal B(λ) of the irreducible highest weight Uq (sln )representation of highest weight λ [Kas90, Kas91]. Furthermore, the crystal operators from Definition 2.1 also give a crystal structure on words of length ℓ, which
we naturally equate with the tensor product B(Λ1 )⊗ℓ (for more details, we refer
the reader to [BS17]). The Lusztig involution is an involution on highest weight
crystals ∗ : B(λ) → B(λ) that sends the highest weight element to the lowest weight
element and extended as a crystal isomorphism
ei (T ∗ ) 7→ (fn+1−i T )∗ ,

fi (T ∗ ) 7→ (en+1−i T )∗ ,

wt(T ∗ ) = w0 wt(T ),

where w0 is the permutation that reverses all entries. We extend this functorially to
tensor products by applying it to every factor and then reversing the factors. The
Lusztig involution is also given by the Schützenberger involution (or evacuation)
on semistandard tableaux [Len07].
Recall that for two Uq (sln )-crystals B, B ′, a strict crystal morphism ψ : B → B ′
is a map ψ : B ⊔ {0} → B ⊔ {0} such that

ψ(0) = 0,
ψ(ei b) = ei ψ(b),
ψ(fi b) = fi ψ(b),
wt ψ(b) = wt(b),

where we consider ei 0 = 0 and fi 0 = 0. We say ψ is an embedding (resp. isomorphism) if ψ −1 (0) = {0} (resp. ψ is a bijection). When there exists an isomorphism
ψ : B → B ′ , we say B is isomorphic to B ′ and denote this by B ∼
= B′.
1The standard references for crystal structures consider the weight as an additive group, but we

consider it as a multiplicative group because it useful for defining polynomials in the sequel.

Theorem 2.2 ([MPS18, Thm. 3.9]). Let λ be a partition. Then
M
µ
SVTn (λ) ∼
B(µ)⊕Sλ ,
=
λ⊆µ

where the Sλµ is the ghest weight elements of weight µ in SVTn (λ).
Pn
For a partition λ, we will sometimes write it as i=1 ci Λi , where ci denotes the
number of columns of height i. This is the usual identification of partitions with
the dominant weights associated to sln using the fundamental weights.
See Figure 1 for an example of the crystal structure on set-valued tableaux.
2.2. Canonical Grothendieck functions. From [Buc02], we can define a symmetric Grothendieck function as
X
β |T |−|λ| wt(T ),
Gλ (x; β) :=
T ∈SVT∞ (λ)

where |λ| denotes the size of λ (i.e., the number of boxes in λ). The value |T | − |λ|
is the so-called excess statistic. When β = 0, we recover the Schur function:
X
wt(T ).
sλ (x) =
T ∈SST∞ (λ)

Note that when we restrict to n variables x1 , x2 , . . . , xn , we recover the β-character
of SVTn (λ) and Gλ (and sλ ) is a polynomial (as opposed to a formal power series).
For more on Schur functions, we refer the reader to [Sta99, Ch. 7].

Jλ (x; α) := Gλ

which recovers the definition given in [PP16, Thm. 6.11] when α = −1 and xi →
7 −xi
(which is for the conjugate shape of the definition in [LP07]). Indeed, following [PP16] we have
∞

X
xi
= xi + αx2i + α2 x3i + · · · =

which is equivalent to allowing multisets to fill the tableaux. More explicitly, define
a (semistandard) multiset-valued tableau of shape λ to be a filling T of the boxes
of λ by finite nonempty multisets of positive integers such that rows are weakly
increasing and columns are strictly increasing in the same sense as for set-valued
tableaux. Let MVTn (λ) denote the set of all multiset-valued tableaux of shape λ
and max entry n. Thus, we arrive at the combinatorial definition of [LP07] for
weak symmetric Grothendieck functions:
X
α|T |−|λ| wt(T ).
Jλ (x; α) =
T ∈MVT∞ (λ)

A third equivalent way to define a weak symmetric Grothendieck function is by
using the involution ω on symmetric functions given by ωsλ (x) = sλ′ (x), where λ′
is the conjugate partition of λ.
Proposition 2.3 ([LP07, Prop. 9.22]). We have
Jλ′ (x; α) = ωGλ (x; α).
Unlike for symmetric Grothendieck functions, we do not obtain a polynomial
when we restrict a weak symmetric Grothendieck function to a finite number of
variables (i.e., it remains a formal power series).
Symmetric Grothendieck functions and weak symmetric Grothendieck functions
have a common generalization given by Yeliussizov [Yel17]. A hook tableau is a
semistandard Young tableau T of the form
h A1 · · · Ak
L1
..
.

.

Lℓ
We call h the hook entry and the entries A(T ) := (A1 , . . . , Ak ) the arm and
L(T ) := (L1 , . . . , Lℓ ) the leg. Let L+ (T ) := {h} ∪ L(T ) denote the extended
leg. A (semistandard) hook-valued tableau of shape λ is a filling T of the boxes
of λ by hook tableaux such that the rows are weakly increasing and the columns
are strictly increasing the in the same sense as for (multi)set-valued tableaux. Let
HVTn (λ) denote the set of hook-valued tableau of shape λ with max entry n. Thus,
following [Yel17], we define the canonical Grothendieck polynomial as
X
α|A(T )| β |L(T )| wt(T ).
Hλ (x; α, β) :=
T ∈HVT∞ (λ)

CRYSTAL STRUCTURES FOR CANONICAL GROTHENDIECKS

Note that
Hλ (x; α, 0) = Jλ (x; α),

Hλ (x; 0, β) = Gλ (x; β).

Furthermore, Equation (2.2) follows from [Yel17, Prop. 3.4].
2.3. Dual canonical Grothendieck functions. A reverse plane partition (RPP)
of shape λ is a filling of λ by positive integers such that rows and columns are weakly
increasing. Define the weight of a RRP P to be
mn
1 m2
wt(P ) := xm
1 x2 · · · xn ,

where here
Pn mi is the numbernof columns that contain an i in P . As before, denote
|P | :=
i=1 mi . Let RPP (λ) denote the set of reverse plane partitions with
maximum entry n. The dual symmetric Grothendieck function gλ (x; β) is defined
combinatorially by
X
β |λ|−|P | wt(P ),
gλ (x; β) =
P ∈RPP∞ (λ)

The dual symmetric Grothendieck functions were shown to form a basis Hopf dual
to the symmetric Grothendieck functions under the Hall inner product [LP07,
Thm. 9.15]. Furthermore, dual symmetric Grothendieck functions are known to
be Schur positive [LP07, Thm. 9.8], where RPPn (λ) was given a Uq (sln )-crystal
structure by Galashin [Gal17].
Let jλ (x; α) denote the dual weak symmetric Grothendieck function, which we can
define by jλ (x; α) = ωgλ′ (x; α). The dual weak symmetric Grothendieck functions
form the Hopf dual basis of the weak symmetric Grothendieck functions [LP07,
Thm. 9.15]. This was also given the following combinatorial interpretation [LP07].
Define a valued-set tableaux of shape λ to be a semistandard Young tableau of shape
λ such that boxes within a particular row are divided into groups. Note that our
description is conjugate to that from [LP07]. Define the weight of a valued-set
tableau V to be
mn
1 m2
wt(V ) := xm
1 x2 · · · xn ,
where here
Pn mi is the number of groups that contain an i in V . As before, denote
|P | := i=1 mi . Thus, the dual weak symmetric Grothendieck function can be
given by
X
α|λ|−|V | wt(V ),
jλ (x; α) =
V ∈VST∞ (λ)

∞

where VST (λ) is the set of all valued-set tableaux of shape λ with max entry n.
We also require some additional definitions on valued-set tableaux in the sequel.
We call the leftmost (resp. rightmost) entry in a group the buoy (resp. anchor ).
Thus, mi in the weight is also equal to the number of buoys i in a valued-set tableau
V and |V | is the number of buoys (equivalently, anchors or groups). We will also
consider groups constructed by adding a vertical divider between certain pairs of
entries i in the same row.
2.4. Stembridge axioms for crystals. We recall the Stembridge axioms [Ste03],
a set of local criteria used to determine if a Uq (sln )-crystal is isomorphic to a
direct sum of highest weight crystals, but instead given the crystal and the crystal

Let B be a set with crystal operators ei , fi : B → B ⊔ {0} such that ei and fi are
computed using an i-signature; that is to say, ei (resp. fi ) changes the rightmost
− (resp. leftmost +) into a + (resp. −). Furthermore, every contribution of a
+ (resp. −) corresponds to multiplying xi (resp. xi+1 ) to the weight. Define an
i-string as a subset of B closed under ei and fi . We require the following statistics
δi (b) := − max{k ∈ Z≥0 | eki b 6= 0},

ϕi (b) := max{k ∈ Z≥0 | fik b 6= 0},

∆i δj (b) := δj (ei b) − δj (b),

∆i ϕj (b) := ϕj (ei b) − ϕj (b),

∇i δj (b) := δj (b) − δj (fi b),

∇i ϕj (b) := ϕj (b) − ϕj (fi b).

The following are the Stembridge axioms:
(P1) All i-strings have no cycles (i.e., there does not exist a b such that fik b = b
for some k > 0) and finite length.
(P2) For any b, b′ ∈ B, we have ei b = b′ if and only if b = fi b′ .
(P3) ∆i δj (b) + ∆i ϕj (b) = Aij .
(P4) ∆i δj (b) ≤ 0 and ∆i ϕj (b) ≤ 0.
(P5) If ei b, ej b 6= 0, then ∆i δj (b) = 0 implies y := ei ej b = ej ei b and ∇j ϕi (y) = 0.
(P6) If ei b, ej b 6= 0, then ∆i δj (b) = ∆j δi (b) = −1 implies y := ei e2j ei b = ej e2i ej b
and ∇i ϕj (y) = ∇j ϕi (y) = −1.
(P5’) If fi b, fj b 6= 0, then ∇i φj (b) = 0 implies y := fi fj b = fj fi b and ∆j δi (y) = 0.
(P6’) If fi b, fj b 6= 0, then ∇i φj (b) = ∇j φi (b) = −1 implies y := fi fj2 fi b =
fj fi2 fj b and ∆i δj (y) = ∆j δi (y) = −1.
Theorem 2.4 ([Ste03, Thm. 3.3]). Let B be a crystal that satisfies the Stembridge
axioms such that every connected component C (i) contains a highest weight element
u(i) of weight λ(i) , then
N
M
∼
B(λ(i) ).
B=
i=1

We note that (P3) and (P4) are equivalent to one of three possibilities:

Aij , ∆i δj (b), ∆i ϕj (b) = (0, 0, 0), (−1, −1, 0), (−1, 0, −1).

From the weight condition of the i-signature, we have φi (b) + δi (b) = mi − mi+1 ,
mn
1
where wt(b) = xm
1 · · · xn . So along with (P2), B with the crystal operators satisfy
the abstract Uq (sln )-crystal axioms [Kas93].
3. Multiset-valued tableaux
In this section, we prove our first main result: there exists a Uq (sln )-crystal
structure on MVTn (λ) such that it is isomorphic to a direct sum of irreducible
highest weight crystals B(µ). After that, we discuss the relation with the usual
crystal structure on semistandard Young tableaux and some consequences for stable
dual Grothendieck polynomials.

3.1. Crystal structure. In order to define the crystal structure, we start by defining the crystal operators ei , fi : MVTn (λ) → MVTn (λ)⊔{0}. We do so by following
the signature rule as for set-valued tableaux in Definition 2.1, for which we need to
define an appropriate reading word. We write multisets as words for compactness.
Definition 3.1 (Reading word). Let T ∈ MVTn (λ). Let C be a column of T .
Define the column reading word rd(C) by first reading the smallest entry of each
box from bottom-to-top in C, then reading the remaining entries from smallest to
largest in each box from top-to-bottom in C. Define the reading word rd(T ) =
rd(C1 ) rd(C2 ) · · · rd(Ck ), where C1 , C2 , . . . , Ck are the columns of T from left-toright.
Example 3.2. For the multiset-valued (column) tableau

113
4445
,

C=
6
7899

we have
rd(C) = 764113445899.
Definition 3.3 (Crystal operators). Fix T ∈ MVTn (λ) and i ∈ I. Write + for
each i in rd(T ) and − for each i + 1 in rd(T ) (ignore all other letters). Next, cancel
signs in ordered pairs −+ until obtaining a sequence of the form + · · · +− · · · −
called the i-signature.
ei T : If there is no − in the resulting sequence, then ei T = 0. Otherwise let b
correspond to the box of the leftmost uncanceled −. Then ei T is given by
one of the following:
• if there exists a box b↑ immediately above b that contains an i, then
remove i + 1 from b and add i to b↑ ;
• otherwise replace the i + 1 in b with an i.
fi T : If there is no + in the resulting sequence, then fi T = 0. Otherwise let
b correspond to the box of the rightmost uncanceled +. Then fi T is given
by one of the following:
• if there exists a box b↓ immediately below b that contains an i + 1,
then remove the i from b and add an i + 1 to b↓ ;
• otherwise replace the i in b with an i + 1.

First we show that the crystal operators are well-defined and satisfy the requisite
properties.
Lemma 3.5. Let T ∈ MVTn (λ) and suppose fi T 6= 0, then the i changed to i + 1
in fi T does not change its position in the reading word. That is to say, we have
rd(fi T ) = fi rd(T ).
Proof. Let T ′ = fi T , and suppose the changed i is in box b. Clearly if i becomes
an i + 1 in the same box, then it does not change its position. Now consider when i
moves from b and becomes an i + 1 in the box b↓ immediately below b. In this case,
the i changed is the rightmost i in the i-signature of T , and hence the rightmost
entry of b in the reading word (we also have max b = i since min b↓ = i + 1). Hence,
the changed i + 1 in T ′ must be read immediately after all entries of b↓ in T ′ have
been read (consider this added i + 1 to be the second such letter), which means it
remains at the same position.

Remark 3.6. We note that our reading word is the column version of the reading
word from [BM12, Def. 2.5]. Furthermore, when we consider the reading word
from [BM12, Def. 2.5] applied to SVTn (λ), but otherwise keep the same crystal
operators, then the analog of Lemma 3.5 holds in that setting. In addition, our
reading word and crystal structure for a single column is similar to the one for the
minimaj crystal from [BCH+ 18].
Lemma 3.7. Let T, T ′ ∈ MVTn (λ). Then
ei T ∈ MVTn (λ) ⊔ {0},

fi T ′ ∈ MVTn (λ) ⊔ {0},

ei T = T ′ ⇐⇒ T = fi T ′ .

CRYSTAL STRUCTURES FOR CANONICAL GROTHENDIECKS

11

Proof. We first show fi T ′ ∈ MVTn (λ) ⊔ {0}, and if fi T ′ = 0, then the claim is
trivially true. Suppose T = fi T ′ is formed by changing an i to an i + 1 within the
same box b. To show T ∈ MVTn (λ), we first note that we could not have an i + 1
in the box b↓ immediately below b. So it remains to show that there does not exist
an i in the box b→ immediately to the right of b. By semistandardness of T ′ , for
the box bց immediately to the right of b↓ , we must have i + 1 ∈
/ bց . Hence, the
→
i ∈ b must correspond to an unpaired + to the right of the + from b, which is a
contradiction. Thus, we have T ∈ MVTn (λ) in this case.
Now instead suppose T = fi T ′ is formed by moving an i from a box b to an
i + 1 in b↓ , the box immediately below b. Since i + 1 ∈ b↓ already in T ′ , we have
T ∈ MVTn (λ).
Next we show the claim ei T = T ′ if and only if T = fi T ′ . From Lemma 3.5
(and the analogous statement for ei ), the i-signatures of T ′ and T must differ by
+ ↔ − corresponding to the i ↔ i+1 with no other cancellations. Hence ei changes
i + 1 7→ i in the same box if and only if fi changes i 7→ i + 1 in the same box.
Therefore, we have ei T = T ′ if and only if T = fi T ′ .
Finally, the claim ei T ∈ MVTn (λ) follows from the other two statements (this
claim could also be proven directly similar to fi T ′ ∈ MVTn (λ)).

Next we show that the coefficient of αa for a weak symmetric Grothendieck of a
single column is isomorphic to a crystal of semistandard tableaux for hook shape.
Note that |T | − k = |T | − |λ|.
Proposition 3.8. Recall that 1k = Λk is a single column of height k. Let
MVTna (Λk ) := {T ∈ MVTn (Λk ) | |T | − k = a}.
Then
MVTna (Λk ) ∼
= B(Λk + aΛ1 ).
Proof. Let µ = Λk + aΛ1 . We prove the claim by constructing an explicit crystal
isomorphism ψ : MVTna (Λk ) → B(µ). We define ψ by
m1

m1 ≤ o1 ≤ · · · ≤ oa1
m2 ≤ oa1 +1 ≤ · · · ≤ oa2
..
.
mk ≤ oak−1 +1 ≤ · · · ≤ oak

o1

···

oa1 oa1+1 · · ·

oa2

···

oak

m2
7→

,

..
.
mk

We note that mi ≤ oai < mi+1 ≤ oai +1 since the column is strictly increasing.
Hence, we have ψ(T ) ∈ SSTn (µ) for all T ∈ MVTn (Λk ). Note also that the reading
words of T and ψ(T ) are equal and so ψ is a crystal isomorphism by Lemma 3.5. 
Theorem 3.9. Let λ be a partition. For any T ∈ MVTn (λ) such that T is a
highest weight element, the closure of T under the crystal operators is isomorphic
to B(µ), where µ = wt(T ). Moreover, we have
M
µ
MVTn (λ) ∼
B(µ)⊕Mλ ,

12

where Mλµ is the number of highest weight elements of weight µ in MVTn (λ), and
X
Jλ (x; α) =
α|µ|−|λ| Mλµ sµ (x).
µ⊇λ

Proof. Note that we can consider any multiset-valued tableau as a tensor product
of single column multiset-valued tableaux by the definition of the crystal operators
and the reading word. In particular, this gives a strict crystal embedding, which
implies that the image is a union of connected components. Hence the first claim
follows from Proposition 3.8, Lemma 3.7, and that the tensor product of highest
weight crystals is a direct sum of highest weight crystals. The other two claims
follow immediately from the first.

We remark that our proof technique is similar to that used in [MPS18] in that
we show the isomorphism for the fundamental building blocks, here these are single
columns (Proposition 3.8), and using general properties of the tensor product rule
(in [MPS18], the building blocks were single rows). We also note that Lemma 3.5
and Lemma 3.7 also immediately yields Theorem 3.9 as every B(µ) is a subcrystal
of B(Λ1 )⊗|µ| , where the strict embedding is given by the reading word.
Proposition 3.10. Suppose T ∈ MVTn (λ) is a highest weight element. Then the
i-th row of T contains only instances of the letter i.
Proof. It is sufficient to show this for the rightmost column C as the claim follows
for T by semistandardness (in particular, that the rows must be weakly increasing).
Suppose the claim is false: there exists a highest weight element T ∈ MVTn (λ) such
that there exists an m in a box b in C at row r > m. Let m be minimal such value.
By the signature rule for em−1 , any + from an m − 1 that would cancel the − from
such an m must occur later in the reading word. If this m is not the smallest entry
in b or the multiplicity of m in b is at least 2, then there is no m − 1 after it in the
reading word by the column strictness of C and that C is the rightmost column in
T . Hence, we have em−1 T 6= 0, which is a contradiction. Otherwise, in order to be
highest weight, there was an m − 1 in row r − 1, we would have m − 1 > r − 1.
However, this contradicts the minimality of m, and so the claim follows.

Corollary 3.11. For any µ ⊇ λ such that B(µ) ⊆ MVTn (λ), we have ℓ(µ) = ℓ(λ).
Proof. This follows immediately from Proposition 3.10 as no k > i can appear in
any highest weight element of MVTn (λ).

Corollary 3.12. The number of highest weight multiset-valued tableaux of shape λ
and weight µ is the number of semistandard Young tableaux of shape µ/λ such that
all of the entries of the i-th row are in the (closed) interval [λ1 + 1 − λi , λ1 ].
Proof. Let µ = (µ1 , µ2 , . . . , µℓ ). By Proposition 3.10, we have ℓ = r as we can
construct any highest weight element T ∈ MVTn (λ) of weight µ by choosing the
number of additional entries xij ≥ 0 of i in each box at position (i, j) ∈ λ such that
P
1≤j≤k xij = µi − λi for all 1 ≤ i ≤ r. However, not all of these elements will be
highest weight by the signature rule; in particular, we require for each (i, j) ∈ λ
that

xi+1,k ≤ λi +
xik .
(3.1)
j≤k≤λi+1

j+1≤k≤λi

CRYSTAL STRUCTURES FOR CANONICAL GROTHENDIECKS

Note that this is equivalent to choosing a semistandard Young tableau of shape
µ/λ with the entries of row i being in the interval [λ1 + 1 − λi , λ1 ] by considering
the k-th extra j read from right to left in column λ1 − i to be an i in row j of
the semistandard Young tableau. Indeed, we cannot have an entry in the interval
[1, λ1 − λi ] and the bracketing condition (3.1) is equivalent to the column strictness
of the Young tableau and the skew shape.

Example 3.13. Consider λ = 32 = 2Λ2 +Λ1 and µ = 44 = 4Λ2 . Then the following
are the highest weight MVT and their semistandard tableaux under Corollary 3.12:

We note that if λ = k r = kΛr is an r × k rectangle, the Corollary 3.12 implies
that the multiplicity is |SSTk (µ/λ)| since [λ1 + 1 − λi , λ1 ] = [k + 1 − k, k] = [1, k] is
a constant. Furthermore, in this case we can consider µ/λ as a straight shape given
by (µ1 − k, µ2 − k, . . . , µr − k), where µ = (µ1 , µ2 , . . . , µr ), and so we can count
them by the hook content formula (see, e.g., [Sta99, Thm. 7.21.2]).
Example 3.14. Let λ = 33 = 3Λ2 and µ = 54 = 4Λ2 + Λ1 . The highest weight
multiset valued tableaux of shape λ and weight µ are in bijection with the set of
SSYT of shape 21 in the letters {1, 2, 3}:

3.2. Uncrowding the crystal structure. An increasing tableau is a semistanc
dard Young tableau that is also strictly increasing across its rows. Let Fµ/λ
denote
the set of increasing tableaux of shape µ/λ where the i-th column is strictly flagged
by i, that is to say the maximum entry in the i-th column is strictly less than i.
RSK
c
We call a tableau in Fµ/λ
a column flagged tableau. Let T ←−−− T ′ denote the
Robinson–Schensted–Knuth (RSK) insertion (see, e.g., [Sta99] for more details on
RSK) of the reading word of T ′ into T .

14

Next, we construct an explicit crystal isomorphism
G

Υ : MVTn (λ) →

B(µ) × Fµ/λ
µ⊇λ

where the crystal structure on the codomain is given by fi (b × F ) = (fi b) × F for all
c
b × F ∈ B(µ) × Fµ/λ
for any fixed µ. We call the map Υ uncrowding as it is given
similar to the uncrowding map for set-valued tableaux (see [Buc02, Sec. 6], [BM12,
Sec. 5], and [MPS18, Thm. 3.12]; see also [RTY18]), but working column-by-column
and measuring the growth of the diagram along columns. More specifically, for any
T ∈ MVTn (λ) we define Υ(T ) recursively starting with bλ1 +1 × Fλ1 +1 = ∅ × ∅.
Suppose we are at step i with the current state being bi × Fi , and let Cj denote the
j-th column of T . Construct
RSK

bi−1 := rd(Ci−1 ) ←−−− rd(Ci ) ←−−− · · · ←−−− rd(Cλ1 ).2
Construct Fi−1 by starting first with Fi of shape µi but shifting the necessary
elements to the right one step, so partially filling in the shape µi−1 /λ≥i−1 , where

λ≥i−1 = max(λ1 − i + 2, 0), . . . , max(λℓ − i + 2, 0)
(3.2)
is the shape of the rightmost i − 1 columns of λ and µi−1 is the shape of bi−1 . Then
add entries in the unfilled boxes in column j with entry j − 1 until Fi−1 has been
filled in. Thus, we constructed the (i − 1)-th step bi−1 × Fi−1 . Repeating this for
every column, the final result is Υ(T ) = b1 × F1 .
Example 3.15. Applying uncrowding to

we first start with b4 × F4 = ∅ × ∅. We then RSK insert the reading word 1 of the

tableau under RSK of 2121 and obtain
b2 × F2 =

where the 1 in the third column comes from F2 shifted to the right one step.

Proof. It is sufficient to show that the map Υ is a bijection as RSK insertion is a
crystal isomorphism (see, e.g., [BS17, LLT02]). By the construction, the result of
Υ satisfies the flagging and row strictness conditions. By the standard properties
of RSK and a straightforward induction, the result of Υ also satisfies the column
strictness condition. So the map Υ is well-defined. We can construct the inverse
Υ−1 by conjugating by the Lusztig involution and recursively by applying reverse
RSK inserting the boxes in the column flagged tableau that are maximal in their
column and the extra column added. Indeed, if we are at bi × Fi , we first apply the
Lusztig involution to bi to get b∗i and perform reverse RSK insertion on the boxes
of b∗i on the outer corners from bottom to top, and then on the outer box in the row
corresponding to a box b in column j of F such that j − 1 is the entry in b, doing
this from left-to-right until no longer possible. That is to say we treat all of these
extra entries as being the same value in the recording tableaux. This determines
the i-th column after applying the Lusztig involution again to the resulting word.
Since RSK(w∗ )∗ = RSK(w), the result is bi+1 × Fi+1 . Thus this is the inverse
procedure of Υ.


16

G. HAWKES AND T. SCRIMSHAW

As a consequence of Theorem 3.17, we have Mλµ = |Fµ/λ |. Furthermore, these
are the conjugate of the flagged increasing tableaux of Lenart [Len00], and so

µ′ ⊇λ

yielding a crystal-theoretic proof of Proposition 2.3 (recall that ω is an involution).
We can construct the recording tableau we use to perform RSK−1 in the proof
of Theorem 3.17 recursively following the description in constructing Υ−1 (b1 × F1 ).
We can clearly reconstruct Fi by using the entries that are maximal in each column.
For the i-th step, suppose the i-th column has height h, we increase all of the current
entries by h + 1, then we set the rightmost unset entry in row j to j + 1. Finally,
for every entry in Fi that is maximal in its column in row j, we set an entry to be
1 in row j. We repeat this until we obtain a semistandard Young tableau.
Example 3.18. Consider b1 × F1 from Example 3.16. Then we construct the
corresponding recording tableau Q as

and then RSK (T , Q) gives the word w∗ = 4583 66886 247899751. When we
apply the Lusztig involution to w∗ and obtain w = 953112368 42244 7256, which
is precisely the reading word of T , and we can separate into columns based on the
values of Q.
Next, we construct a bijection with the set from Corollary 3.12.
λ1

Proposition 3.19. Let SST (µ/λ) be the set of semistandard Young tableaux from
λ1
Corollary 3.12. Then the map φ : Fµ/λ → SST (µ/λ), where φ(T ) is constructed
by subtracting i − λ1 to each entry of the i-th column of T , is a bijection.
Proof. It is easy to see that the strictly increasing rows condition in Fµ/λ is equivalent under φ to the weakly increasing rows condition in SSTk (µ/λ). Furthermore,
the maximum entry in column i being i condition in Fµ/λ is equivalent under φ to
λ1

the largest entry in column i under φ in SST (µ/λ) is i − (i − λ1 ) = λ1 (and hence
for every row). Similarly the minimum entry in row j for an increasing tableau

CRYSTAL STRUCTURES FOR CANONICAL GROTHENDIECKS

17

in Fµ/λ is 1 in column λj , which is equivalent to the minimum entry for row j in
λ1

SST (µ/λ) is 1 − (λj − λ1 ) = λ1 + 1 − λj . Thus φ is well-defined and surjective.
The map φ is clearly invertible, and hence φ is a bijection.

For any w ∈ Sn , let Hw
denote the set of words of length k that are equivalent to
some reduced expression for w in the 0-Hecke monoid (i.e w = si1 · · · siℓ is considered as i1 · · · iℓ ). Note that this does not depend on the choice of reduced expression
for w by Matsumoto’s theorem [Mat64] (i.e., that any two reduced expressions for
w are related by the braid relations).

1 ≤ p ≤ m. The strictly increasing condition ap1 < · · · < apℓp is equivalent to the
notion of a compatible pair of words from [BKS+ 08].
Let Pw (λ) denote the set of increasing tableaux of shape λ such that reading
the entries of P from top-to-bottom, right-to-left (i.e., also known as the FarEastern reading word) is equivalent to w in the 0-Hecke monoid. Let SVT(λ)k
(resp. MVT(λ)k ) denote the set of set-valued (resp. multiset-valued) tableaux T
such that |wt T | = k. The (column) Hecke insertion defined in [BKS+ 08] is a

bijection between Hw,m and λ Pw (λ) × SVT(λ)k ([BKS+ 08, Lemma 1,Thm. 4]).3

4. Crystal structure on hook-valued tableaux
Now we prove our second main result, that the hook-valued tableaux of [Yel17]
admits a Uq (sln )-crystal structure that is isomorphic to a direct sum of highest
weight crystals. We do so by constructing a common generalization of the crystal
structures on SVTn (λ) and MVTn (λ). Thus, we define the reading word using the
reading words on SVTn (λ) and MVTn (λ).
Definition 4.1 (Reading word). Let T ∈ HVTn (λ). Let C be a column of T .
Define the column reading word rd(C) by first reading the extended leg from largest
to smallest in each box from bottom-to-top in C, then reading the entries in the arm
from smallest to largest in each box from top-to-bottom in C. Define the reading
word rd(T ) = rd(C1 ) rd(C2 ) · · · rd(Ck ), where C1 , C2 , . . . , Ck are the columns of T
from left-to-right.

Similarly, we define crystal operators by combining the set-valued crystal operators and the multiset-valued crystal operators.
Definition 4.3 (Crystal operators). Fix T ∈ HVTn (λ) and i ∈ I. Write + for each
i in rd(T ) and − for each i + 1 in rd(T ) (ignore all other letters). Next, cancel signs
in ordered pairs −+ until obtaining a sequence of the form + · · · +− · · · − called
the i-signature.

ei T : If there is no − in the resulting sequence, then ei T = 0. Otherwise let b
correspond to the box of the leftmost uncanceled −. Then ei T is given by
one of the following:
(M) if there exists a box b↑ immediately above b that contains an i, then
remove an i + 1 from A(b) and add i to A(b↑ );
(S) otherwise if there exists a box b← immediately to the left of b that
contains an i + 1 in L(b← ), then remove that i + 1 from L(b← ) and
add an i to L+ (b);
(N) otherwise replace the i + 1 in b with an i.
fi T : If there is no + in the resulting sequence, then fi T = 0. Otherwise let
b correspond to the box of the rightmost uncanceled +. Then fi T is given
by one of the following:
(M) if there exists a box b↓ immediately below b that contains an i + 1,
then remove the i from A(b) and add an i + 1 to A(b↓ );
(S) otherwise if there exists a box b→ immediately to the right of b that
contains an i in L+ (b→ ), then remove the i from L+ (b→ ) and add an
i + 1 to L(b);
(N) otherwise replace the i in b with an i + 1.
Since the hook element of b→ is min L+ (b→ ), if the element i we remove from
L (b→ ) happens to also be the hook element, we can unambiguously give the new
hook element of b→ as min L(b→ ). Similarly, if the added element i < min L+ (b),
then i becomes the new hook element in b. Furthermore, we note that Case (M)
(resp. (S)) correspond to the multiset-valued (resp. set-valued) tableaux crystal
operators. In particular, we are in Case (S) when the i + 1 (resp. i) we are acting
upon in b by ei (resp. fi ) is in L+ (b).

is not semistandard.

Lemma 4.5. Let T, T ′ ∈ HVTn (λ). Then
ei T ∈ HVTn (λ) ⊔ {0},

fi T ′ ∈ HVTn (λ) ⊔ {0},

ei T = T ′ ⇐⇒ T = fi T ′ .

Proof. We can assume ei T 6= 0 and fi T ′ 6= 0 as the claim is trivial in these cases.
When we are in Case (N) or Case(M) for the crystal operators, the proof of this
is similar to the proof of Lemma 3.7. Thus, we assume the crystal operators are
in Case (S), and we assume the crystal operator acts on the box b. Denote the
following boxes around b:
b

b→

b↓ bց

.

Consider fi T ′ . Since there exists an i ∈ b→ , there cannot exist an i + 1 ∈ b by
semistandardness. There also cannot be an i + 1 ∈ b↓ (if it exists) as otherwise
we would be in Case (M), and by semistandardness i + 1 ∈
/ bց (if it exists). We
→
note that i ∈ b must be canceled as otherwise we would be acting on b→ by the
signature rule. Hence, there must also exist an i + 1 ∈ L(b→ ). Thus, fi T ′ is defined
and in HVTn (λ).
From the above argument, we have that the i + 1 ∈ b in T = fi T ′ , which now
cancels with the i ∈ b. Thus the i + 1 ∈ L+ (b→ ) is now an unpaired −, and by
the semistandardness of T ′ , there does not exist an i in the box immediately above
b→ . Hence, we are in Case (S) for ei T and clearly ei T = T ′ .
The final claim ei T ∈ HVTn (λ) follows from the other two statements.

Since either we have a pairing −+ or that εi (T ) (resp. ϕi (T )) corresponds to the
number of unpaired − (resp. +), which corresponds to an i + 1 (resp. i), we have
hhi , wt(T )i := mi − mi+1 = ϕi (T ) − εi (T ),
recall that mi is the number of i’s that appear in T .
Theorem 4.6. Let λ be a partition. For any T ∈ HVTn (λ) such that T is a highest
weight element, the closure of T under the crystal operators is isomorphic to B(µ),
where µ = wt(T ). Moreover, we have
M
µ
HVTn (λ) ∼
B(µ)⊕Hλ ,
=
µ⊇λ

where Hλµ is the number of highest weight elements of weight µ in HVTn (λ), and
X P
P
Hλ (x; α, β) =
α b∈T |A(b)| β b∈T |L(b)| swt(T ) (x),
T

where the sum is taken over all highest weight elements in HVTn (λ).
Proof. Let T ∈ HVTn (λ).
−1
Clearly we have wt(fi T ) = wt(T ) · α−1
(this is the multii , where αi = xi xi
plicative version of one of the crystal axioms). Thus, (P1) is satisfied by weight
considerations and that HVTn (λ) is a finite set and closed under the crystal operators (Lemma 3.7). (P2) is satisfied by Lemma 3.7.
If |i − j| > 1 (so Aij = 0), then by the signature rule, we have ∆i δj (T ) =
∆i ϕj (T ) = 0. Now assume |i − j| = 1. Then we have introduced an extra i in
the j-signature of ei T . So by the signature rule, we have ∆i δj (T ), ∆i ϕj (T ) =

CRYSTAL STRUCTURES FOR CANONICAL GROTHENDIECKS

21

(−1, 0), (0, −1) depending on if j = i ± 1 and if the i cancels in the j-signature or
not. Hence, (P3) and (P4) are satisfied.
To show (P5), if |i − j| > 1, then the signature rule implies (P5) since the jsignatures of T and ei T are equal and similarly for the i-signatures of T and ej T .
Furthermore, it is clear that y := ej ei T = ei ej T with ∇j ϕi (y) = 0.
Therefore, assume j = i ± 1 and ∆i δj (T ) = 0, that is to say εj (ei T ) = εj (T ).
Hence, the j-signature of ei T is formed by either removing an uncanceled +4 (if
j = i + 1) or adding a canceling − (if j = i − 1) to the j-signature of T at position
p′ . Note that only Case (S) for ek moves a letter k + 1 in position pe in the reading
word (as Lemma 3.5 naturally extends to this setting) immediately to the right of
the first k + 1 to the right of pe, where it becomes a k. In any case, this does not
affect the leftmost uncanceled − at position p, and hence ej acts on a j + 1 in the
same position p in rd(T ) and rd(ei T ). Note that we must have p′ < p. Therefore,
we form the i-signature of ej T from the i-signature of T by adding an uncanceled
− to the right of p′ , which contributes the leftmost uncanceled − (which remains
the leftmost uncanceled −). Hence, ei acts on the same i in T and ej T .
Next, suppose ei acts on box b in T . Note that ei+1 cannot add an i + 1 to
the box b← immediately to the left of b unless there was already an i + 1 ∈ b← .
Since ei acts on the same i + 1 in T and ej T , the ei−1 cannot move the only i from
the box b↑ immediately above b. Hence, ei acts using the same case in T as in
ej T , and similarly for ej acting by the same case in T and ei T . Therefore, we have
y := ej ei T = ei ej T with ∇j ϕi (y) = 0.
Now we show (P6), and so we assume ∆i δj (T ) = ∆j δi (T ) = −1. Due to the
symmetry, we assume j = i + 1 without loss of generality. We must form the isignature (resp. (i + 1)-signature) of ei+1 T (resp. ei T ) from the i-signature (resp.
(i + 1)-signature) of T by adding an uncanceled − (resp. removing a canceling +).
As a result, if ei (resp. ei+1 ) acts on position p (resp. p′ ) in the reduced word, we
must have p < p′ with an additional i + 1 before position p. Let k = i + 2. By
semistandardness, we have one of the following configurations on i, j, k (where we
ignore all other letters):
<i

and with the boxes not necessarily adjacent, where ei (resp. ej ) acts on the rightmost j (resp. k), the shaded boxes do not necessarily exist, and ∗ ≤ i (with possibly more than one entry in the arm). Note that if the boxes are not adjacent
where a Case (S) occurs in the above configurations, then we cannot have Case (S)
occur in any of the crystal operators, and so the result holds from Lemma 3.5,
which holds in this setting for Case (M) or Case (N), and the crystal of words.
4The e might act by removing a canceling + further to the left of the uncanceled + that is
i
ultimately removed.

22

G. HAWKES AND T. SCRIMSHAW

Similarly, if a Case (S) occurs in a box that does not have one of the local configuration, then the result follows from the crystal of words and the boxes do not
interact. Thus, it is a finite check to see that we have y := ei e2j ei T = ej e2i ej T and
∇i ϕj (y) = ∇j ϕi (y) = −1.
The proof of (P5’) and (P6’) is similar. Hence the Stembridge axioms hold. Note
that the crystal operators preserve the sum of the arm lengths and the sum of the
leg lengths. Therefore, the exponent of xi in the weight of any T in a connected
component for αa β b is bounded above by a + b, and so every connected component
has a highest weight element. Therefore, we have

by Theorem 2.4.



As an immediate consequence of Theorem 4.6, we have that Hλ (x; α, β) is Schur
positive.

their corresponding reading words on the right:

Let T be the upper-left hook-valued tableau. We note that while the position of
the 1 that is acted on by f1 in T and f2 T , it is still the second 1 in the reading
word. Thus ϕ1 (T ) = ϕ1 (f2 T ), and we have f1 f2 T = f2 f1 T .
5. Crystal structure on valued-set tableaux
In this section, we define a Uq (sln )-crystal structure on valued-set tableaux that
is isomorphic to a direct sum of highest weight crystals. Furthermore, we give
an explicit crystal isomorphism with the usual crystal structure on semistandard
Young tableaux through the inflation map.
5.1. Crystal structure.
Definition 5.1 (Reading word). Let T ∈ VSTn (λ). Define the reading word rd(T )
to be the reading word of the usual reverse Far-Eastern (bottom-to-top, left-toright) reading word of the tableau where we only consider the buoy entries.

where we have written the buoys in bold, and we have
wt(T ) = x21 x22 x23 x34 x55 x6 x7 x8 .

rd(T ) = 75321485153452456,

Definition 5.3 (Crystal operators). Fix T ∈ HVTn (λ) and i ∈ I. Write + for each
i in rd(T ) and − for each i + 1 in rd(T ) (ignore all other letters). Next, cancel signs
in ordered pairs −+ until obtaining a sequence of the form + · · · +− · · · − called
the i-signature.
ei T : If there is no − in the resulting sequence, then ei T = 0. Otherwise let g
correspond to the group of the leftmost uncanceled −. Then ei T is given
by one of the following:
• if the entry immediately above the anchor of g is an i, move the divider
between g and the group immediately to the left g one step up;
• otherwise change every i + 1 to an i in g.
fi T : If there is no + in the resulting sequence, then fi T = 0. Otherwise let
b correspond to the box of the rightmost uncanceled +. Then fi T is given
by one of the following:
• if the entry immediately below the anchor of g in an i + 1, move the
divider between g and the group immediately to the left g one step
down;
• otherwise change every i to an i + 1 in g.

Lemma 5.5. Let T, T ′ ∈ VSTn (λ). Then, we have
ei T ∈ VSTn (λ) ⊔ {0},

fi T ′ ∈ VSTn (λ) ⊔ {0},

ei T = T ′ ⇐⇒ T = fi T ′ ,

and rd is a strict crystal embedding of VSTn (λ)
Proof. It is clear all claims hold when a divider does not move, and so we assume a
divider moves under the crystal operators. In particular, if the divider does move

24

under fi , then it means locally the crystal operator fi does the steps

i+1

Note that by the semistandardness, the anchor for the i + 1 group must be weakly
to the left of the anchor for the left i group, but the group for the i + 1 may extend
further to the right than the right i group. The operator ei does the above steps
in reverse order. Therefore, it is straightforward to see the claims follow by the
definition of the reading word.

Theorem 5.6. Let λ be a partition. We have
M
µ
VSTn (λ) ∼
B(µ)⊕Vλ ,
=
µ⊆λ

Vλµ

where
is the number of highest weight elements of weight µ in VSTn (λ). Moreover, we have
X
jλ (x; α) =
α|λ|−|µ| Vλµ sµ (x).
µ⊆λ

Proof. First note that the numbers, bi , of buoy entries in column i are preserved
under all crystal operations and therefore are the same amongst all elements of a
connected component of V ST n (λ). Moreover, it is not difficult to check that for
any specified values of bi there is at most one valued-set tableau of shape λ for
any given reading word. Thus, within a connected component the map T → rd(T )
is injective. The result now follows from Lemma 5.5 and that every B(µ) is a
subcrystal of B(Λ1 )⊗|µ| .

We also have analogs of Proposition 3.10, Corollary 3.11, and Corollary 3.12.
Proposition 5.7. Suppose T ∈ VSTn (λ) is a highest weight element. Then the
i-th row of T contains only instances of the letter i.
Proof. This is similar to the proof of Proposition 3.10 (or for B(λ)), for a highest
weight element T .

Corollary 5.8. If Vµλ 6= 0, then ℓ(λ) = ℓ(µ).
Proof. This follows from Theorem 5.6, Proposition 5.7, and that every row of a
valued-set tableau must have at least one group.

Recall that a conjugate semistandard tableau is a tableau that is weakly increasing down columns and strictly increasing across rows.
Corollary 5.9. The number of highest weight valued-set tableaux of shape λ =
(λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λℓ ) and weight µ = (µ1 , µ2 , . . . , µℓ ) is the number of conjugate semistandard tableaux of shape (µ1 − 1, µ2 − 1, . . . , µℓ − 1) such that all of the entries of
the i-th row are strictly less than λi .
Proof. This follows from Proposition 5.7, which allows us to construct a bijection
such that the value in box b in row i and column j of a such a conjugate semistandard tableau corresponds to the position of the buoy (or anchor) of the j-th group
of row i in a highest weight valued-set tableau with the last group in each row being
fixed. Note that the column weakly increasing condition precisely corresponds to
canceling pairs in the i-signature.


CRYSTAL STRUCTURES FOR CANONICAL GROTHENDIECKS

25

We can also parameterize the highest weight elements analogous to Corollary 3.12.
Corollary 5.10. The number of highest weight valued-set tableaux of shape λ and
weight µ is the number of reverse plane partitions of shape λ/µ such that all of the
entries of the i-th row are in the (closed) interval [µ1 + 1 − µi , µ1 ].
Proof. This follows from Proposition 5.7, which allows us to construct a bijection
such that the j-th box of the i-th row of λ/µ is Ni,j + µ1 − µi , where Ni,j is the
number of buoy entries to the left of the j-th nonbuoy entry of row i of the highest
weight valued-set tableau.

Next we consider the crystal structure if we consider the reading word using the
anchors instead of the buoys.

Proposition 5.13. We obtain the same crystal if we use the anchor entries instead
of the buoy entries to define the reading word.
Proof. To contrast with Lemma 5.5, the fi operator moves dividers locally as
i

i

i .

26

G. HAWKES AND T. SCRIMSHAW

This also preserves the reading word and yields the same result. Additionally note
that Proposition 5.7 and the bijection constructed in proving Corollary 5.9 holds in
either reading word. Since all highest weight words of weight µ generate the same
crystal B(µ), the claim follows.

Proposition 5.13 holds if we instead define the reading word based on selecting
any entry in any group as long as the crystal operators move the selected entry
within each column (when moving dividers).
Remark 5.14. In [Gal17, Remark 9], it was essentially noticed that the crystal
structure on reverse plane partitions by taking the topmost entry in each column
is the same as taking the bottommost. This is analogous to Proposition 5.13.
5.2. Inflation map. Define a column semistandard flagged tableau to be a conjucs
gate semistandard whose i-th column is strictly flagged by i. Let Fλ/µ
denote the
set of column semistandard flagged tableaux of shape λ/µ.
Next, we construct an explicit crystal isomorphism
G
cs
ι : VSTn (λ) →
B(µ) × Fλ/µ
,
µ⊆λ

where the crystal structure on the codomain is given by fi (b × F ) = (fi b) × F
cs
for all b × F ∈ B(µ) × Fλ/µ
for any fixed µ. We call the map ι inflation. For
n
any T ∈ VST (λ), we define ι(T ) recursively starting with bλ1 +1 × Fλ1 +1 = ∅ × ∅.
Suppose we are at step i with the current state being bi × Fi , and let Cj denote the
j-th column of T consisting only of the anchor entries. Construct
RSK

RSK

RSK

bi−1 := rd(Ci−1 ) ←−−− rd(Ci ) ←−−− · · · ←−−− rd(Cλ1 ).
Construct Fi−1 by starting first with Fi of shape µi but shifting the elements to
the right one step and increasing them by 1, which partially fills in the shape
λ≥i−1 /µi−1 , where λ≥i−1 is from Equation (3.2) and µi−1 is the shape of bi−1 .
Then set all of the unfilled boxes of Fi−1 to 1. Thus, we constructed the (i − 1)-th
step bi−1 × Fi−1 . Repeating this for every column, the final result is ι(T ) = b1 × F1 .
Example 5.15. Let T be the valued-set tableau from Example 5.2. Applying
inflation to T we obtain

resulting in ι(T ) = b1 × F1 .
Theorem 5.16. We have
VSTn (λ) ∼
=

M

cs

B(µ)⊕|Fλ/µ | ,

µ⊆λ
cs
where the isomorphism is given by the inflation map ι, and so Vλµ = |Fλ/µ
|. Moreover, we have
X

jλ (x; α) =
|sµ (x).
α|λ|−|µ| |Fλ/µ
µ⊆λ

Proof. This is similar to the proof as for [LP07, Thm. 9.8] except for conjugating by
the Lusztig involution and working column-by-column as in Theorem 3.17. Indeed,
the i-th step of ι adds a vertical strip to bi by well-known properties of RSK, and
thus these boxes added to form bi−1 are precisely the boxes that are not filled
with a 1 in Fi−1 . Therefore, the inverse map (deflation) ι−1 is given recursively
by performing inverse RSK (with conjugating by the Lusztig involution) on the
boundary boxes of bi that do not immediately have a 1 to the right in Fi . It is
clear that this is the inverse procedure (the i-th column of the resulting valued-set
tableaux is the leftmost column of step i) and the claim follows.

Remark 5.17. The inflation map for valued-set tableaux is analogous to the bijection from [LP07, Thm. 9.8] for reverse plane partitions, which is also a crystal

28

isormorphism using the crystal structure from [Gal17]. Furthermore, as noted in the
proof, this analogy is the same as that for the uncrowding multiset-valued tableaux
to uncrowding set-values tableaux.
Example 5.18. Consider b1 × F1 from Example 5.15. We will take the Lusztig
involution in sl9 . Thus we have

ι−1 (b1 × F1 ) (the rest of the entries of the column are non-anchor entries in their
groups). For the next step, we have
