We propose to select the lower bounds of the nearly optimal fidelity values such that their deviations
from unit fidelity are less than the minimum error probability characterizing the optimum ambiguous
discrimination scheme between the two nonorthogonal quantum states yielding the chosen nearly

distribution of the target state on the unit sphere in N -dimensional complex Hilbert space, we
determine that the modified algorithm can indeed outperform the original analog counterpart of a

INTRODUCTION

In 1997, Grover presented a quantum algorithm for solving very large database search problems [1], one of the
outstanding problems in computational science [2]. Grover’s search algorithm enables searching for an unknown
marked item in an unstructured database of N items by accessing the database a minimum number of times. From
a classical standpoint, one needs to test N/2 items, on average, before identifying the correct item. With Grover’s
√
algorithm however, the same task can be completed successfully with a complexity of order N , that is, with a
quadratic speed up. The original formulation of Grover’s algorithm was presented in terms of a discrete sequence of
unitary logic gates (digital quantum computation). Alternatively, Farhi and Gutmann proposed an analog version of
Grover’s algorithm in Ref. [3] where the state of the quantum register evolves continuously in time under the action of
a suitably chosen driving Hamiltonian (analog quantum computation). For recent discussions on the transition from
the digital to analog quantum computational setting for Grover’s algorithm, we refer to Ref. [4–6]. The formulation
of the analog algorithm proposed by Farhi and Gutmann can be briefly described as follows. Consider N mutually
orthonormal states and assume that only one of them has non-zero energy (energetically marked state). Starting
from an equal superposition of the N states, the problem is to determine how quickly the system can evolve under a
given Hamiltonian so that the energetically marked state is reached with certainty. Within the working assumption of
time-independent Hamiltonian evolutions, Farhi and Gutmann showed that their algorithm required a minimum time
√
of the order N , thus yielding the same complexity as Grover’s original algorithm. Interestingly, the evolution time
√
for the analog algorithm scaled like N /E, with E denoting the energy of the marked state, just as demanded by the
time-energy uncertainty principle [7]. In Refs. [7–9], it was shown that the minimum time interval required for an
isolated quantum system to evolve to an orthogonal (that is, perfectly distinguishable) state is inversely proportional
to its constant energy spread. Such minimum time is also known as orthogonalization time in the literature. In
Ref. [10], the maximum speed of evolution of an isolated quantum system was interpreted in terms of the maximum
number of distinct states that the system can explore in a fixed time interval. This fixed time interval was shown to
be inversely proportional to the system’s quantum mechanical average energy minus its ground state energy. For a
unified tight bound on the rate of quantum dynamical evolution based on both the average energy and the energy
spread of the system, we refer to Ref. [11]. The presence of a finite non-orthogonality in the context of quantum
limits to dynamical evolutions was considered, for instance, in Ref. [12] and Ref. [13]. In the former work, the
expression of the states that minimize the time necessary to evolve, under a time-independent Hamiltonian, from an
initial quantum state to a final state that is only approximately orthogonal was found. It is worth noting that the

3
final state is only approximately orthogonal for a given upper bound on the mean energy of a general closed system.
In the latter work, on the contrary, an extension of the concept of quantum speed limit to mixed states in the case
where the quantum system does not evolve from an initial state to an orthogonal state (that is, the case of non-zero
fidelity) was proposed.
In our paper, instead of allowing for a finite non-orthogonality between the quantum states that leads to a nonzero fidelity, we consider a complementary scenario. We allow for a finite non-parallelism that yields a non-unit
fidelity. The consideration of nearly optimal state searching is instructive for various reasons. First, it is reasonable
to take into account the fact that actual measurements always involve a countable set of outcomes and thus, any
realistic measurement device has finite resolution [14]. Second, finite resolution measurements can reveal more about
the physical properties of quantum systems than precise measurements [15]. Third, it is known that a quantum
measurement can enhance the transition probability between two pure states [16] and, finally, it is indisputable that
quantum measurement cannot perfectly discriminate between two nonorthogonal pure states [17].
Motivated by these considerations, the questions we address in this paper can be outlined as follows: First, what
is the minimum time necessary to reach a given nearly optimal fidelity value in a continuous time quantum search
algorithm? Second, is it possible to formulate a modified version of the original Farhi-Gutmann search algorithm
that leads to such a selected fidelity value in a shorter time than the one required by the original Farhi-Gutmann
algorithm? Third, how can we reasonably justify the choice of a lower bound for such a nearly optimal fidelity value?
We demonstrate that it is possible to extend the original work performed by Farhi and Gutmann in order to speed
up the procedure for producing a suitably distributed unknown normalized quantum state with high non-unit fidelity.
In particular, by modifying the original working assumptions of perfect state overlap and uniform distribution of the
target state on the unit sphere in the N -dimensional complex Hilbert space, the newly proposed algorithm can indeed
outperform the original analog counterpart of a quantum search algorithm. This is achieved for a convenient choice
def

of both the ratio γ = E 0 /E between the eigenvalues E 0 and E of the modified search Hamiltonian and the quantum
mechanical overlap x between the initial and target states.
The layout of the remainder of this paper is as follows. In Section II, we extend the Farhi-Gutmann optimality
proof to the case of an imperfect quantum state overlap. In Section III, we present the transition probability for
the modified version of the Farhi-Gutmann analog algorithm. In Section IV, we explain how we choose the lower
bounds of the nearly optimal fidelity values by means of quantum discrimination techniques. Specifically, we impose
that deviations from unit fidelity are less than the minimum error probability characterizing the optimum ambiguous

4
discrimination scheme between the two nonorthogonal quantum states yielding the selected nearly optimal fidelity
values. In Section V, we compare in terms of minimum run time the original and the modified quantum search
algorithms and identify a two-dimensional parametric region where the modified algorithm outperforms the original
one under the working assumption of imperfect state transfer compatible with finite precision quantum measurements.
Our concluding remarks appear in Section VI. Finally, technical details on the numerical values of the quantum overlap
x can be found in Appendix A.

II.

THE MODIFIED OPTIMALITY PROOF

In this section, we modify the original optimality proof by Farhi and Gutmann in Ref. [3] by relaxing the requirement
of finding the desired target state with certainty. In particular, we wish to determine how the search time shortens if
we only want to achieve a nearly optimal fidelity value.
The optimality proof provided by Farhi and Gutmann in Ref. [3] for producing the target state |wi relies on two key
working assumptions. First, the target state is produced with absolute certainty. In other words, the modulus squared
of the quantum state overlap, that is, the transition probability or transition fidelity at the end of the production
procedure is equal to unity. Second, the target state |wi is an unknown element of a given orthonormal basis {|ai}
def

with 1 ≤ a ≤ N of an N -dimensional complex Hilbert space H2n with N = 2n . Our modified optimality proof for
an imperfect quantum state overlap follows closely the lines of the original optimality proof presented in Ref. [3].
Consider a quantum system, assumed to be initially in a state |ii at time t = 0 that does not depend on the target
state |wi and evolves by means of a Hamiltonian H given by,
def

H = Hw + HD ,

(1)

def

where Hw = E |wi hw|. For the discussion that follows, it is unnecessary to specify the explicit expression for the
driving Hamiltonian HD in Eq. (1). The problem being investigated is that of finding a lower bound t̃ on the time t for
the |wi-independent state |ii to evolve into the state |wi given that its evolution is governed by the time-independent
Hamiltonian H in Eq. (1). Let us consider the following two initial value problems,

proof. We do not require achieving the absolute certainty of producing the target state at the end of the evolution

The quantity |w⊥ i denotes a (normalized) state orthogonal to the target state |wi contained in the two-dimensional
subspace of the full Hilbert space spanned by |wi and |w⊥ i. A suitable choice for the parametrization of the state

ψw t̃ in Eq. (3) is given by,

ψw t̃ = cos (δ) |wi + e−i(θw −θw⊥ ) sin (δ) |w⊥ i ,

(5)

where θw and θw⊥ are arbitrary real phases while δ is assumed to be a small and positive real parameter. Finally,

for convenience and without loss of generality, we set θw − θw⊥ = π/2 so that ψw t̃ becomes

ψw t̃ = cos (δ) |wi − i sin (δ) |w⊥ i ,

(6)


where i denotes the complex imaginary unit. In what follows, we assume 0 ≤ δ  1 so that cos2 (δ) = 1 − δ 2 + O δ 4

and sin2 (δ) = δ 2 + O δ 4 . For the sake of clarity, we point out that the validity of this latter working assumption
will be explicitly clarified by means of Eq. (38) and Fig. 2 in the next section. Furthermore, we have


cos (δ) = 1 − (1/2)δ 2 + O δ 4 , and sin (δ) = δ + O δ 3 .

operator. Therefore in general, the quantity δ can depend on certain characteristics of the chosen time-independent
search Hamiltonian H.
For the sake of clarity, we point out that our proposed modified optimality proof is not meant to be used to
determine the optimality of a modified continuous time quantum search algorithm. The lower bound in Eq. (27) is
only useful for providing the optimality of the scaling of the complexity of any algorithm specified by the Hamiltonian
in Eq. (1). In particular, its purpose is to find out the behavior with respect to the parameter δ of the minimum
time necessary to achieve a desired nearly optimal transition probability value (that is, cos2 (δ) with 0 ≤ δ  1)

when evolving from a source state |ii to an approximate target state ψw t̃ under the Hamiltonian in Eq. (1). In
other words, we have not compared the optimality of two distinct algorithms that aim to solve the same identical
task. Instead, we are interested in finding out how the performance of a single algorithm, quantified in terms of the
minimum time necessary to accomplish the task, is affected when two distinct tasks have to be completed. In our
case, the first task (that is, the original task) is to find the target state with certainty (that is, success probability
equal to one). The second task (that is, the modified task), instead, is to search for an approximate target state that
corresponds to a success probability that is only nearly equal to one. In summary, when considering the original task,
√
(exact) def
we go from |ii to |wi with success probability one and t̃min
= (}/2E) N . In the modified task, we go from |ii
√

(approximate) def
to ψw t̃ with success probability cos2 (δ) where 0 ≤ δ  1 and t̃min
= (}/2E) (1 − δ) N . In both cases,
the same algorithm described by the Hamiltonian in Eq. (1) is employed.
Our proposed modified optimality proof allowed us to formally introduce the parameter δ in a general physical
setting where it is not necessary to specify the explicit expression of the driving Hamiltonian HD in Eq. (1). The
following section, instead, includes a more specific discussion on the functional form of the parameter δ for a specific
choice of the driving Hamiltonian.

THE MODIFIED FARHI-GUTMANN SEARCH HAMILTONIAN

In this section, we present the transition probability for the modified version of the Farhi-Gutmann analog search
algorithm. Assume that the time-independent Hamiltonian H in Eq. (1) is given by,
def

H = Hw + HD = E |wi hw| + E 0 |si hs| ,

(28)

where,
def

def

Hw = E |wi hw| and, HD = E 0 |si hs| .

(29)

Observe that when E 0 = E, the Hamiltonian H reduces to the Hamiltonian as originally proposed by Farhi and
Gutmann in Ref. [3]. Furthermore, assume that |wi is the normalized target state while |si is the normalized initial
state with hs|wi = x that evolves in an unitary fashion according to Schrödinger’s quantum mechanical evolution law,

LOWER BOUNDS ON THE FIDELITY VALUES

Having introduced the parameter δ in a general setting in Section II (see Eq. (27)) and in a more specific framework
in Section III (see Eq. (38)), we would like to address in Section IV the following question: How big can δ be chosen?
In principle, we could arbitrarily choose a nearly optimal threshold value of the error probability for quantum search.
However, in what follows, we propose a way to justify to a certain extent this arbitrariness with some plausible line of
reasoning. First, at the end of the search, we expect that the approximate and the exact target states will be very close.
Therefore, the error probability for quantum search (that is, its deviation from the unit fidelity) will be very small.
Second, since these target states have a large overlap, it will be difficult to distinguish them. Therefore, we also expect
that the error probability for quantum state discrimination will be large. Given these two considerations, it is intuitive
that in our working conditions the error probability for quantum search will be smaller than the error probability for
quantum state discrimination. However, even in the presence of large overlaps between quantum states, it is possible
to device highly successful quantum state discrimination protocols where the minimum error probability can be made
arbitrarily small. We propose to select the minimum success probability values for quantum search by imposing that
the deviation from the unit fidelity is smaller than the smallest (compatible with realistic finite-precision quantum
measurements) minimum error probability achievable in highly successful quantum state discrimination protocols for
quantum states with very large overlaps.
If we desire to consider a very small departure ∆F (δ) from the unit fidelity,
def

∆F (δ) = Foptimal − Fnearly-optimal (δ) = 1 − cos2 (δ) ,

(39)

12
we expect 0 ≤ 1 − cos2 (δ) ≤ ε with 0 ≤ ε  1, that is
def

0 ≤ δ ≤ δmax (ε) = cos−1

√


1−ε .

(40)

Therefore, the question becomes: How small should the real parameter ε in Eq. (40) be chosen? How do we select
this value? Can we physically motivate such a choice for ε? In what follows, motivated by theoretical quantum state
discrimination principles [17, 18] and acknowledging the presence of imperfections in actual quantum measurement
settings that limit the precision of the measurement of angles [19, 20], we propose a way to select the numerical upper
(lower) bounds for δ (Fnearly-optimal (δ)).
We recall that the goal in a quantum state discrimination problem is to identify the actual state of a quantum
system that is prepared, with a fixed prior probability, in a specific but unknown state that belongs to a finite set
of given possible states [17, 18]. An essential property of quantum mechanics is that two pure states cannot be
distinguished perfectly, if they are not orthogonal. Therefore, there are fundamental limitations in quantum state
discrimination protocols on the success with which one can determine the actual state. Specifically, when the possible
states are not mutually orthogonal, it is not possible to develop a state-distinguishing protocol that can discriminate
between them perfectly. Relevant state-distinguishing techniques are the unambiguous [21–23] and the ambiguous
[24–26] state discrimination schemes. Unambiguous state discrimination requires that, whenever a definite (that is,
conclusive) outcome is recorded after the measurement, the result must be error free (that is, unambiguous). When the
measurement fails to provide a definite outcome, a nonzero probability of inconclusive outcomes has to be taken into
consideration. Then, the optimum unambiguous discrimination scheme is realized when the failure probability (that
is, the probability of inconclusive outcomes) is minimum. On the contrary, ambiguous state discrimination requires
that a conclusive outcome has to be recorded in each single measurement. This in turn implies that the discrimination
is ambiguous since errors in the conclusive result are unavoidable. Based on the measurement outcome, a guess is
made as to what the actual state of the quantum system was. Then, the optimum ambiguous discrimination scheme
is obtained when the error probability (that is, the probability of making a wrong guess) is minimum. For a very
instructive discussion on how to interpret the original Farhi-Gutmann analog quantum search algorithm as a method
for improving the distinguishability of a set of Hamiltonians by adding a controlled driving term, we refer to Ref. [27].
Being in the framework of ambiguous quantum state discrimination, assume that we are given one of two normalized
def

quantum states |ψ1 i = |wi and |ψ2 i = |w̃i, not necessarily orthogonal, with prior probabilities p1 = pw and p2 =

1 − p1 = pw̃ , respectively. Furthermore, assume we have been asked to optimally determine which state we have

(41)

From Eq. (41), we note that the minimum error probability pE is a monotonic increasing function of the quantum
def

mechanical overlap hw|w̃i = cos (δ). In particular, when δ approaches zero (that is, very large quantum overlap) and
pw = pw̃ , it can become quite challenging to distinguish the state |ω̃i from the state |ωi since the probability of making
an incorrect guess approaches 50%. Alternatively, we point out that in the presence of large asymmetry between the
prior probabilities pw and pw̃ , the success of the discrimination protocol increases and, as a consequence, it becomes
less difficult to discriminate between |wi and |w̃i. For instance, when pw̃ = 10−2 pw , the minimum error probability pE
approaches the liming value 10−2 as the angle δ approaches zero. We observe that the quantum mechanical overlap
hw|w̃i plays a key role in both quantum state discrimination and nearly optimal analog quantum search. In the former
case, it is the essential quantity that sets a bound to the effectiveness of the discrimination scheme. In the latter case, it
quantifies the departure from the perfect unit fidelity. In view of the above mentioned considerations, it becomes useful

that departs from the unit perfect fidelity Foptimal = 1 by an amount ∆F (δ) = Foptimal − Fnearly-optimal (δ). We
impose that the quantity ∆F (δ) is smaller than the minimum error probability pE (δ) in Eq. (41),
def

0 ≤ ∆F (δ) = Foptimal − Fnearly-optimal (δ) ≤ pE (δ) .

(42)

Eq. (42) implies that we choose to select the lower bounds of the nearly optimal fidelity values {Fnearly-optimal (δ)} in
such a manner that their deviations {∆F (δ)} from the unit fidelity Foptimal are less than the minimum error probability

fidelity values. A plot of pE (δ) as a function of the angle δ for a variety of sets of a priori probabilities appears in
Fig. 3. We point out that the proposed inequality in Eq. (42) is reminiscent of the (sandwich) Fuchs-van de Graaf
inequalities relating the trace norm distance and the fidelity as suitable measures of closeness for quantum states [28].
Indeed, the trace norm distance appears in the expression for the minimum error probability while the fidelity appears
in the equation for the transition probability in our discussion. For the sake of completeness, we also remark that
while Fuchs and van de Graaf were only concerned with the problem of distinguishing between two quantum states
with equal a priori probabilities, an extension of their analysis to the case of arbitrary a priori probabilities can be
found in Ref. [29]. As a final consideration, we emphasize that in the limiting case of equal a priori probabilities
together with the conditions 0 ≤ δ  1, it is straightforward to verify that our inequality in Eq. (42) can be obtained
from the Fuchs-van de Graaf inequalities. In particular, as explained below, the sharpness of the bounds that we
propose in Eq. (42) can be tuned by means of the degree of asymmetry that specifies the a priori probabilities of the
two quantum states being distinguished.
Recalling Eq. (40), the problem was the determination of how small the real parameter ε in Eq. (40) should be.
We are now in the condition to provide an answer to this issue. We note that, after some straightforward algebra and
using Eq. (39), the inequality constraint in Eq. (42) yields
def

0 ≤ δ ≤ δmax (p̄w ) = cos−1

hp

i
1 − p̄w (1 − p̄w ) .

(43)

The quantity p̄w in Eq. (43) denotes a fixed value of the prior probability pw . Knowing that p̄w̃ + p̄w = 1 and setting
p̄w̃ = αp̄w with α being the degree of asymmetry between the two a priori probabilities p̄w̃ and p̄w , Eq. (43) becomes
def

0 ≤ δ ≤ δmax (α) = cos−1

(44)

We observe that in the maximally symmetric scenario, we have (p̄w , p̄w̃ ) = (1/2, 1/2) (that is, α = 1). Instead, in
the maximally asymmetric scenario, we have (p̄w , p̄w̃ ) = (1, 0) (that is, α  1) or (p̄w , p̄w̃ ) = (0, 1) (that is, α  1).
Equating Eqs. (40) and (44), we obtain a formal expression for ε in terms of the degree of asymmetry coefficient α,
def

−2

ε (α) = α (1 + α)

.

(45)

From Eq. (45), we note that to get an ε of the order of 10−2  1, one needs to have α of the order of 102 . As previously
mentioned, highly successful discrimination protocols characterized by very small minimum error probability values
can be obtained when strong asymmetries between the prior probabilities pw and pw̃ occur. In such cases, the values

15
of δmax (p̄w ) can be rather small. For instance, when pw = 103 pw̃ , δmax ' 3.16 × 10−2 and Fnearly-optimal ≥ 0.999. We
point out that this order of magnitude of angles is quite small. Indeed, in real world settings one necessarily deals
with imperfect measurements where intrinsic uncertainties yielding non-negligible systematic errors may be present.
For instance, the intrinsic uncertainty of a polarization rotor, typically of the order of 2o − 4o on the Bloch sphere
(where 1o ' 1.75 × 10−2 rad.), limits the precision of the measurement on a polarization qubit [19].
For the sake of clarity, we point out that in our numerical calculations that appear into the next section, the two
a priori probabilities pw and pw̃ will not be arbitrarily chosen. They will be chosen in such a manner to yield highly
successful discrimination protocols in which it is not difficult to discriminate between the exact and approximate
quantum states despite their high degree of overlap. Such protocols are characterized by very low minimum error
probability, which, in turn, is achievable when there is a sufficient degree of asymmetry α between the two a priori
probabilities corresponding to the two states that we wish to distinguish (see Fig. 3). Then, to a larger α there
corresponds a smaller ε. Specifically, we shall be considering asymmetries of the order of 102 since they yield minimum
error probability values of the order of 10−2 which are low enough for high degree of overlaps specified by angles of the
order of 10−2 rad. Then, being in the framework of highly successful quantum discrimination protocols, we choose the
accuracy the search has to achieve by imposing that the departure ∆F of the unit fidelity Foptimal from the nearly
optimal desired fidelity value Fnearly-optimal must be smaller than the already small minimum error probability pE .
Imposing that δmax is of the order of the maximum achievable angular resolution in a typical quantum mechanical
experiment [19], we find how asymmetric the two a priori probabilities must be chosen in order to guarantee the
required accuracy the search should achieve.
In what follows, we compare the performances of the original and the modified Farhi-Gutmann analog quantum
search algorithms. Clearly, both algorithms are stopped when they reach the same chosen lower bound.

V.

COMPARISON OF THE TWO SEARCH ALGORITHMS

In this section, we identify a two-dimensional parametric region where the original algorithm is outperformed by
the modified one provided one focuses on nearly optimal fidelity values compatible with the maximum resolution of
the previously mentioned quantum discrimination protocol. For the sake of convenience, we shall refer to the original
Farhi-Gutmann algorithm (γ = 1) as the special algorithm while the general algorithm denotes the modified version
of the Farhi-Gutmann algorithm where E 0 = γE with γ ≥ 1. The transition probability P (t; x, E, E 0 ) with E 0 = γE

the numerical estimates of the minimum error probability pE are calculated by assuming pw = 102 pw̃ which yields a
maximum value of δ that equals δmax ' 9.92 × 10−2 .
As a further clarifying remark, we point out that the numerical values (originated from our proposed comparison of
the two algorithms and reported in Table I) were computed by considering the minimum time such that the desired
success probability values were obtained. We have simply chosen the desired success probability values to be equal to
the maximal success probability values of the modified algorithm in our analysis. However, as evident from Fig. 5,
we could have chosen different threshold values (leading to shorter minimum times) and still outperform the original
algorithm (provided that only a nearly optimal search is considered). As a side remark, we emphasize that this
line of reasoning extends naturally to any desired success probability value taken as the maximal success probability
Pthreshold = Pgmax with Pgmax = Pgmax (x, γ) in Eq. (48) and where the points {(x, γ)} can be chosen to belong to
the black-colored region in Fig. 4. Specifically, in Fig. 5 we plot Pg (t) (dashed line) and Ps (t) (solid line) as a
function of time t. For the sake of reasoning, we set h = 1, E = 1, x = 0.80, and γ = 1.1. The two horizontal
max
lines in Fig. 5 denote two selected success probability values, Pthreshold
= 0.9987 (dotted line) and Pthreshold = 0.9

(dotted-dashed line). The threshold value 0.9987 was taken from the fourth line in Table I. We note that the minimum
time such that the two desired success probability values are obtained is smaller in the case of the modified algorithm
for both selected thresholds. Specifically, in the first and second scenarios, we have 1.93 × 10−1 ≤ 2.02 × 10−1 and
−1

2.97 × 10−1 ≤ 3.01 × 10−1 , respectively. Note that in the MKSA unit system, [t]MKSA = [h]MKSA [E]MKSA . Since we
have considered E = 1 = h in our numerical computations, time t is assumed to be dimensionless.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this paper, we focused on the problem of nearly optimal state searching and we demonstrated that it is possible
to modify the original Farhi-Gutmann search Hamiltonian (see Eq. (28)) in order to speed up the procedure for
finding a suitably distributed unknown normalized quantum state |wi under the working assumption that only a
nearly optimal fidelity is achieved,
def

Pmax (δ) = cos2 (δ) ,

(56)

def

with 0 ≤ δ = cos−1 [hw|w̃i]  1 where |wi and |w̃i denote the exact and the approximate target states, respectively.
More specifically, upon relaxing the working assumptions of exact state overlap and uniform distribution of the target
state on the unit sphere in the N -dimensional complex Hilbert space, we showed that the proposed algorithm (see
Eq. (28)) can indeed outperform the original analog counterpart of a quantum search algorithm. This enhanced
def

performance occurs for a convenient choice of both the ratio γ = E 0 /E between the eigenvalues of the modified
def

search Hamiltonian and the quantum mechanical overlap x = hw|si between the initial (|si) and the target (|wi)
states.
In summary, the main results of our work can be described as follows. First, we extended the optimality proof

20
presented in Ref. [3] to the case of nearly optimal state searching and determined that the minimum time interval to
def

find the target state with probability Pmax (δ) = cos2 (δ) is given by (see Eq. (27)),

Second, we computed the transition probability P (t; x, E, E 0 ) (see Eq. (32)) that arises from our proposed search
algorithm and determined its maximum value Pmax (x, γ) (see Eq. (34) and Fig. 1) together with the instant t∗ (x, γ)
(see Eq. (36)) at which this maximum is achieved. Third, from the formal introduction of the quantity δ in Eq. (3)
and the expression of Pmax (x, γ) in Eq. (34), we found an explicit expression for the quantity δ = δ (x, γ) (see Eq.
(38) and Fig. 2) responsible for our imperfect state search in terms of the two parameters x and γ that characterize
our search Hamiltonian,

Fourth, we introduced the notion of approximate target state |w̃i. Such a quantum state |w̃i is characterized by
a sufficiently large overlap with the exact target state |wi so that, as we proposed, the deviation ∆F (δ) from the
unit fidelity F = 1 is smaller than the minimum error probability pE (δ) achievable in an optimal quantum state
discrimination protocol (see Fig. 3) for the set of quantum states {|wi , |w̃i},
0 ≤ ∆F (δ) = 1 − cos2 (δ) ≤ pE (δ) ,

(59)

with pE (δ) defined in Eq. (41). Finally, using numerical methods, we showed that for a fixed transition probability
threshold 0 ≤ Pthreshold < 1 and suitably chosen non-uniform probability distribution functions of the target state on
the unit sphere (see Eq. (A4)), there exist two-dimensional parametric regions rP (x, γ) (see Eq. (55)) in which the
proposed algorithm outperforms the original one in terms of speed (see Fig. 4, Table I, and Fig. 5) for the special
task (namely, finding the approximate target state) it sets out to solve.
We believe that our analysis presented in this paper can serve as a relevant starting point for a more rigorous
investigation that would include both theoretical and experimental aspects of the tradeoff between fidelity and run
time of quantum search algorithms. For instance, it is known that to mitigate the effect of decoherence originating
from the interaction of a quantum system with the environment, it is helpful to decrease the control time of the
control fields employed to generate a target quantum state or a target quantum gate. Simultaneously, to enhance the
fidelity of generating such targets and reach values arbitrarily close to the maximum F = 1, it may be convenient to
increase the control time beyond a certain critical value. When the control time reaches a certain value that may be

21
close to the just mentioned critical value however, decoherence can become a dominant effect. Therefore, investigating
the tradeoff between fidelity and time control can be of great practical importance in quantum computing [30–32].
For instance, one can design algorithms seeking suboptimal control solutions for much reduced computational effort,
since it is very challenging to find a rigorous optimal time control and in many cases the control is only required to
be sufficiently precise and short. For example, the fidelity of tomography experiments is rarely above 99% due to
the limited control precision of the tomographic experimental techniques as pointed out in Ref. [31]. Under such
conditions, it is unnecessary to prolong the control time since the departure from the optimal scenario is essentially
negligible. Hence, it can certainly prove worthwhile to design slightly suboptimal algorithms that can be much
cheaper computationally. Our analysis can be improved in a number of ways. First, our work can be strengthened
by explicitly considering the quantum measurement process in our analysis. For instance, it is known that quantum
measurement can be regarded as a decoherence process that potentially enhance or reduce a transition probability
between two quantum states [16]. Second, as a starting point of our investigation, we could consider a more general
time-independent search Hamiltonian where the probability of obtaining the target state can be very large and nearly
one [33]. Furthermore, in order to work in a more realistic setting, nearly optimal time-dependent search Hamiltonians
specified in terms of the so-called schedule function of the search algorithm could also be considered [34]. Finally,
from a more ambitious perspective, we could explore the manner in which recent investigations on intelligent forms of
quantum searching algorithms in the presence of imperfections, with the help of techniques borrowed from quantum
machine learning [35], would connect to our nearly optimal quantum search problem.
In conclusion, we hope to pursue a more rigorous and realistic analysis that includes these intriguing theoretical
and experimental aspects in forthcoming scientific efforts.

Appendix A: Numerical values of the quantum overlap

In this Appendix, we present a more in depth discussion on the probability of small and large numerical values of
the quantum overlap x.
In general, one may argue that large values of the overlap x are not very typical or particularly realistic since they
occur when the source state is essentially already the desired target state. This objection has its merit when one
assumes that the realistic scenario is the one in which no a priori information on the target state is available and, in
particular, the target state is assumed to be a normalized vector in a list of N possible orthonormal states. Indeed,
1

within these working assumptions, x = N − 2 and the largest value of x that would be considered realistic is obtained
for N = 4 and equals x = 1/2. However, one can envision a circumstance in which a priori relevant knowledge is
available so that the target state is a suitably chosen non-uniformly distributed normalized vector in a N -dimensional
vector space. In such a scenario, the probability of occurrence of large values of x can begin to be non-negligible.
Thus, large values of x can become realistic in these new working conditions. We point out that a priori knowledge
happens to be useful in both quantum metrology and imperfect (optimal) quantum cloning. In the former case, in
order to design the best parameter estimation scheme, some form of a priori knowledge of such a parameter is required
[36]. In the latter case, instead, knowledge of the distribution of qubits on the Bloch sphere that encodes some a
priori information on a given quantum state that one desires to clone is taken advantage of in order to achieve the
highest fidelity [37, 38]. For instance, in the specific framework of phase-independent quantum cloning, one assumes
to clone qubits that are a priori known to be symmetrically distributed around the Bloch vector [37].
As pointed out in Section II, the optimality proof by Farhi and Gutmann occurs under the special working assumption that the target state |wi is an unknown element of a given orthonormal basis {|ai} with 1 ≤ a ≤ N of an
def

N -dimensional complex Hilbert space H2n with N = 2n . As pointed out earlier, in this scenario it is rather unlikely
1

that x = N − 2 assumes values close to one. In their more general setting however, Farhi and Gutmann assume that
the target state |wi is an arbitrary normalized vector in a N -dimensional complex Hilbert space which is uniformly
distributed on the unit sphere [3].
We briefly recall that the space enclosed by a (2N − 1)-dimensional unit sphere S 2N −1 is a (2N )-ball whose infinitesimal volume element in spherical coordinates is given by,
(spherical) def

dV2N -ball

= r2N −1 sin2N −2 (θ1 ) sin2N −3 (θ2 ) ... sin (θ2N −2 ) drdθ1 dθ2 ...dθ2N −2 dθ2N −1 ,

(A1)

where θi ∈ [0, π) for any 1 ≤ i ≤ 2N − 2 and θ2N −1 ∈ [0, 2π). Furthermore, the volume element of the (2N − 1)-

25
dimensional unit sphere generalizes the concept of the area element of a two-dimensional unit sphere and, from Eq.
(A1), is given by
(spherical) def

= sin2N −2 (θ1 ) sin2N −3 (θ2 ) ... sin (θ2N −2 ) drdθ1 dθ2 ...dθ2N −2 dθ2N −1 .

(A2)

Returning to our discussion, we assume that the probability density function ρw (θ) that describes the distribution of
the states |wi on the (2N − 1)-dimensional unit sphere depends on the coordinate θ1 , denoted as θ, which is uniform
with respect to the remaining coordinates. Therefore, by marginalizing over all the unimportant integration variables
def

but θ with x = |hs|wi| = cos (θ) where 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2, we find that the probability that x is greater than a given value
x̄ is given by [3],

The quantity ρw (θ) in Eq. (A3) denotes a well-defined probability density function (pdf), that is to say, a pdf that
is positive and normalized to one. For the sake of reasoning, we select |si to be at the north pole. Generalizations
to less peculiar scenarios are straightforward. In what follows, we provide some rationale for our choice of ρw (θ).
The functional form of ρw (θ) is essentially that of a Gaussian with mean µθ and variance σθ2 multiplied by a suitably
chosen oscillatory function. The mean is set equal zero, while any value of µθ between 0 and π/2 can be chosen
provided that the variance σθ2 is not too small. Furthermore, the multiplying factor in the proposed expression of
2N −2

ρw (θ) is chosen in such a manner as to substantially mitigate the oscillatory behavior of [sin (θ)]

in Eq. (A3)

and leads when multiplied with it, to an approximately constant function over the selected domain of integration.
Practically, one can consider a narrowly distributed Gaussian peaked nearby the location of the initial state or, for
a Gaussian peaked far away from such a location, the width of the Gaussian has to be suitably larger. Under this
assumption, a convenient choice for our analysis is given by the following pdf,

In Eq. (A4), N = N N , σθ2 is a normalization factor that depends on the choice of N and σθ2 . For instance, for
N = 16, σθ2 = 1, and x̄ = 0.95, by means of numerical integration, we find Prob(x ≥ 0.95) ' 21%. We note that
with a smaller σθ2 , the probability of x being greater than a selected value x̄ increases and asymptotically approaches
unity. For instance, for σθ2 = 10−1 and σθ2 = 10−2 , we observe that Prob(x ≥ 0.95) ' 58% and Prob(x ≥ 0.95) ' 99%,
respectively. We point out that if N = 16 and ρw (θ) is uniform as selected in Ref. [3], Prob(x ≥ 0.95) ' 3.2 × 10−17 .
Therefore, although the probability is not exactly zero, it is very unlikely that x is close to 1 when assuming uniformity

26
for ρw (θ). For this reason, we considered here nearly optimal (imperfect) state searches where the target state is not
uniformly distributed on the unit sphere. As a final remark, we point out that the assumption that the target state |wi
is selected at random means that we assume absolute ignorance (that is, maximum entropy) about the location of the
target. If we somehow learn an important piece of information about the location of the target however, one can think
of updating his/her state of knowledge (see Ref. [39], for instance) about the target with a new probability density
function of the state on the (2N − 1)-dimensional space. As a consequence, the search algorithm can be adapted to
the target in order to improve the efficiency of the searching scheme. We emphasize that these considerations are
reminiscent of what happens in channel-adapted quantum error correction [40–42] and adaptive quantum computing
[43] where classical learning techniques can be used to enhance the performance of certain quantum tasks [44]. We
leave the exploration of these intriguing ideas to future investigations.
