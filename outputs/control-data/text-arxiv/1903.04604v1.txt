We develop a stochastic approach to time-dependent DFT with optimally-tuned rangeseparated hybrids containing non-local exchange, for calculating optical spectra. The attractive electron-hole interaction, which leads to the formation of excitons, is included
through a time-dependent linear-response technique with a non-local exchange interaction
which is computed very efficiently through a stochastic scheme. The method is inexpensive
and scales quadratically with the number of electrons, at almost the same (low) cost of
time dependent Kohn-Sham (TDKS) with local functionals. Our results are in excellent
agreement with experimental data and the efficiency of the approach is demonstrated on
large finite phosphorene sheets containing up to 1958 valence electrons.

INTRODUCTION

The understanding of optical excitations in
materials is essential for developing novel optical and electronic devices.1,2 However, it is
very challenging to calculate optical properties in extended systems. For small molecules,
highly correlated approaches are used, including configuration interaction or the equation
of motion coupled cluster approach.3,4 Further,
the optical response is typically described by
the Bethe-Salpeter equation.1,5 These high level
techniques are predictive but scale steeply with
the number of electrons so they can only be used
for relatively small molecules and unit cells.
An alternative to costly many-body techniques is time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT)6 that describes excited state energies, geometries, and other properties of small
molecules with a relatively moderate computational cost. In principle TDDFT is exact, but

in practice approximations have to be introduced. The most common is the adiabatic timedependent Kohn-Sham theory (TDKS). While
TDKS has been applied successfully to a wide
range of molecular systems,1,2 it suffers from
many failures, particularly for extended systems, charge-transfer excited states,7 multiple
excitations,8 and avoided crossings.9 The most
notable problem of TDKS is the inability to capture low-lying excitonic states in bulk.1,5
It has been argued that a TDDFT formulation beyond the Kohn-Sham picture,
namely, a TD-GKS (Generalized Kohn-Sham)
approach10 which employs a non-local exchange
interaction,11–13 captures the necessary physics
to describe excitation in extended systems14–16
and accurately predicts the formation of bound
excitons. However, the inclusion of the nonlocal exchange in the TDDFT calculations
makes them computationally demanding and
out of reach for large nanoscale systems. Recently a family of stochastic orbital methods
has been developed to describe ground and
excited states with the goal of lowering the
computational complexity at the cost of introducing a controllable statistical error.17–22

2
Specifically relevant to the current work is a
stochastic ground state range-separated hybrid
DFT method20 and a stochastic method for the
Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE).21
Our first and main aim in this work is to overcome, using stochastic methods, the computational bottleneck in TDDFT with non-local exchange. Specifically, we develop a real-time generalized Kohn-Sham method based on a rangeseparated hybrid (RSH) with a long-range exact
exchange operator. The approach has similarities to that proposed for stochastic BSE (where
a damped exchange operator was used), but
the starting point is different. Here, the starting point is long-range-corrected RSH-DFT, a
method which is known to produce excellent
charge-transfer states.23 Therefore the present
long-range exchange TDDFT starts only from
a long-range DFT calculation (which is also implemented stochastically), so the resulting approach is self-contained in the DFT/TDDFT
framework and does not resort to a separate
computation of individual quasiparticle states;
this is in contrast to a BSE work where the
starting point is a prior calculation of the quasiparticle states which is achievable, e.g., through
the stochastic GW method.18,22,24
The second aim of the paper is then to use
the resulting fully ab-initio stochastic TDDFT
method for describing optical excitations in extremely large systems with thousands of electrons.
Below, we first (Sec. II) review the basic theory and present our stochastic implementation.
In Sec. III we verify our method by comparing with experiment for PH3 and the method is
then applied to study 2D phosphorene sheets of
increasing sizes. Conclusions follow in Sec. IV.

THEORY

It is well-known that absorption can be determined, in linear response, from the timeevolution of an induced dipole density (see Appendix I). This time evolution is in principle
governed by the time-dependent Schrödinger
equation, which is however intractable beyond

few-electron systems. DFT25 is practical approach for recasting the many-electron system
as a set of virtual particles interacting via a
mean-field exchange-correlation (xc) potential.
The original formulation of the Kohn-Sham
(KS)26 DFT scheme describes the xc interactions by a local potential which is in principle
non-local in time. In practice it is further approximated, e.g., by (semi)local functionals of
the electronic density at given time (i.e., the
functional is adiabatic). As mentioned in the
introduction, this formulation has some notable
failures, e.g., missing excitonic effects. An alternative route, which we pursue here, is to employ
a GKS scheme10,11,27 with non-local long-range
asymptotic behavior as required for correct description of charge transfer and polarizability28
and for electron-hole bound states.12,14–16
We first review below the formulation of
DFT and TDDFT with long-range non-local exchange, followed by the details of stochastic implementation.

A.

DFT with long-range non-local exchange

The GKS Hamiltonian reads
γ
H[n, ρ] ≡ h0 +vH [n (r)]+vC
[n (r)]+X γ [ρ (r, r0 )] ,
(1)
where h0 contains the kinetic energy and
the electron-nuclear attraction. The densitydensity repulsion is given by the Hartree poγ
tential vH , and vC
(where γ is defined shortly)
is a (semi)local correlation density functional –
we use here a local functional form.29 The nonlocal exchange interaction X γ is a functional of
the density-matrix ρ (r, r0 ), where the density
is of course n(r) = ρ(r, r). (Note that we use
different symbols, n and ρ, for the density and
density matrix since later we calculate the two
separately - one deterministically and the other
stochastically.)
The form of X γ derives from a screened
Coulomb interaction governed by a single parameter γ.12,27,30 Specifically, the Coulomb ker-

3
nel is partitioned as:
erfc (γr) erf (γr)

(2)

where γ is the range separation parameter. The
first term dominates at small distances (r → 0)
and its contribution to the exchange is approximated by a local density functional.29–31 The
second term in Eq. (2) is active at large distances and gives the non-local Fock exchange
γ
(Xnl
). The matrix element of the exchange vector is a direct product of the density matrix and
the non-local Coulomb interaction (the simple
product form is important later in the stochastic formulation):
γ
Xnl
(r, r0 ) ≡ −ν(r, r0 )ρ (r, r0 ) .

(3)

Here, the long-range interaction is ν(r, r0 ) =
erf (γ|r − r0 |) /|r − r0 |, and the density matrix

is

dex and fi are the occupationP
factors, while the

density is n(r) = ρ(r, r) =
i fi |φi (r)| . (In
the following we do not denote spin explicitly.)
Thus, deterministically, the nonlocal exchange
term acts on a general function ψ as
γ

|ψi =

fi φi (r) ν(r, r0 )φi (r0 ) ψ (r0 ) dr0 .

In the first (DFT) stage, the occupied eigenstates φi (r) of Eq. (1) are calculated selfconsistently, ensuring Hφi = εi φi , where the
density and density matrix are functions of the
eigenstates. The value of γ is found by enforcing
the IP theorem that requires that the HOMO
energy equals the ionization energy. This optimal tuning leads to good IPs and fundamental
band gaps in finite systems.32–34
The method’s success stems from the combination of (semi)local functionals that capture
correlation effects well at short distances with
γ
the nonlocal Xnl
that guarantees for finite systems the asymptotically correct 1/r behavior
of the exchange potential which is crucial for
proper inclusion of the attractive electron-hole
interaction.1,28

TDDFT with long-range non-local exchange

It is well-known (Appendix I) that the absorption spectrum is obtained from a linearresponse propagation of the density. Specifically, for polarized excitation along a unit vector ê, we apply a small perturbation δν(r, t) =
(r · ê)δ(t)∆ where ∆ is a small constant (typically between 10−3 and 10−5 a.u.). Then, the
system evolves under the time-dependent GKS
equation (using ~ = 1)
E
E h
i
i φ̇i (t) = H [n (t) , ρ (t)] + δν(r, t) φi (t) .
(5)
To simplify the notation we usually do not denote the dependence of the density and density
matrix (and therefore of the time-dependent
Hamiltonian) on the excitation strength ∆.
The Hamiltonian H (t) is time dependent as it explicitly depends on the propagated eigenstates φi (r, t), the P

and

i fi φ (r, t) φi (r , t). The dipole moment along
the excitation direction
R is then calculated from
the density, µ(t) = (r · ê)n(r, t)dr, and the
absorption spectrum is calculated by Fourier
transforming the dipole moment µ(t) (Appendix I).
In principle, the exchange-correlation term in
the Hamiltonian should account for memory effects, but since its form is unknown, we resort
to the adiabatic approximation and construct
the xc terms directly from n (r, t) and ρ (r, r0 , t).
Thus, the difference from Kohn-Sham type adiabatic TDDFT is only in the exchange kernel.
The application of the non-local exchange
as presented in Eq. (3) is computationally demanding, due to the integral over the density
matrix. Practical calculations are therefore limited to systems with a low number of states.

C.

Stochastic DFT with non-local exchange

Next we review our implementation20 of the
DFT equations with a stochastic representation

4
of the non-local exchange operator. This is followed by implementation of stochastic TDDFT
in the next section.
The first step is the DFT ground-state calculation, where we use the stochastic-exchange
approach of Ref. 20. This grid-based method is
done by two key parts. The first is the representation of the density matrix as an average over
stochastic correlation functions. Specifically, we
construct stochastic states {η}, each of which is
a linear combination of all the occupied eigenstates {φi } (cf. Refs.17, 19, 21, 35, and 36)
Xp
η (r) =
fi φi (r) hφi |η̄i,
(6)
i

where η̄ is a completely random real vector, e.g.,
η̄(r) = ±(dV )−1/2 , and dV is the grid volumeelement. It is straightforward to show that as
an operator, the density matrix becomes an average over the separable terms
ρ = {|ηihη|}η̄

(7)

i.e., ρ (r, r0 ) = {η (r) η (r0 )}η̄ , where {· · · }η̄ denotes a statistical average over all random states
η.
¯ Since the average of |ηihη| yields the density
matrix, we can view η(r) as a stochastic density
amplitude.
In the ground-state DFT stage we supplement the stochastic representation of the density matrix by a similar stochastic decomposition of the long-range Coulomb interaction
(Eq. (7)) using stochastic states ζ:
erf (γ |r − r0 |)
= {ζ (r) ζ (r0 )}θ̄
|r − r0 |
that are evaluated as
1 X 0p
ζ (r) = 1
ν (γ, k)ei(θ̄(k)+k·r)
V2 k

(8)

(9)

where θ̄ (k) is a random phase and we impose
θ̄(−k) = −θ̄(k) to ensure that ζ(r) are real.
Also, V is the total volume. The prime in the
summation indicates that the k = 0 term is
excluded and is later added analytically. The

γ-dependent long-range Coulomb interaction in
|k|2 γ 2

momentum space is ν (γ, k) = 4πe− 4 /|k|2 .
Note that the average in Eq. (8) is over the random phases θ̄ (k) which determine the stochastic function ζ (r).
The stochastic decompositions of the density
matrix and of the Coulomb potential are then
combined to give
γ
hr|Xnl
|φi =

− {ξ(r)hξ|φi}η̄θ

Nξ
1 X j
ξ (r)hξ j |φi (10)
'−
Nξ j=1

where the combined exchange-operator stochastic amplitude is simply ξ(r) = η(r)ζ(r). The average is done now over Nξ random states; each
sampling (labeled by j) of random ξ(r) amounts
to a simultaneously choosing (independently)
both the phases θ(k) and the random vector
η̄(r), so ξ j (r) = η j (r)ζ j (r).
Eq. (10) is formally exact if the number of
states Nξ → ∞. For any finite numberpNξ there
is a statistical error proportional to 1/ Nξ , but
since the long-range exchange vector is not numerically large this error is small even when
Nξ is only a few hundreds. Further details,
such as the supplementary use of a deterministic HOMO/LUMO when extracting γ, are given
in Ref. 20.
Note that in this present approach the only
operator which is stochastically sampled is
the long-range exchange. The density is still
sampledPdeterministically from the eigenstates,
n(r) = i fi |φi (r) |2 , and the DFT cost is similar to that of traditional deterministic DFT for
semilocal functionals. In practice, one can use
any usual DFT algorithm to iteratively solves
Hφi = εi φi for the occupied states, with H conγ
structed from n(r) and from Xnl
in Eq. (10).
The statistical errors in this mixed approach, where only the exchange is sampled
stochastically, are much smaller than in our
fully-stochastic DFT approach17,37 where the
stochastic orbitals η(r) were also used to sample
 the2 local density (i.e., where we use n(r) =
|η(r)|2 , or more generally n(r) = n0 (r) +
|η(r)| , where n0 (r) is a fragment density).

5
In the fully-stochastic approach the eigenstates
do not need to be determined17,35,36 so it formally scales linearly with system size; here the
scaling goal is more modest, just to reduce
the cost to that of traditional DFT (and later
TDDFT) with only local and semilocal potentials.

Stochastic TDDFT with non-local exchange

Following the DFT stage with stochastic
exchange, we turn to the implementation of
stochastic-exchange in TDDFT. There is no
need to use the same exact methodology for the
stochastic exchange in the TDDFT as in the
DFT stage. Here, we follow21 and use a different sampling of the stochastic density matrix at
each time step. Specifically, at each time-step
we represent the density matrix as an average
over stochastic vectors, where each one is constructed from the occupied eigenstates:

β (r, t) =

X

eiαj (t)

p

fj φj (r, t) ,

(11)

j

where αi (t) ∈ [0, 2π] is a random phase. Thus,
each β is a stochastic vector created using a distinct set of random phases {αi }, and a different
set of random phases is taken as each time step.
Obviously {β(r, t)β ∗ (r0 , t)} = ρ(r, r0 , t).
Note that the η and β vectors have a similar
meaning; the former is used for the initial timeindependent stage, the latter for TDDFT. We
use a different symbol to emphasize that the
number of such stochastic vectors is different
in DFT and TDDFT. Specifically, since each
time-step is small the effect of the stochastic
exchange per time step is numerically small, so
that it is sufficient to use only a small number
(Nβ ) of vectors in each time step. For that reason, we have not done a stochastic resolution
of the Coulomb kernel for the time-dependent

Thus the cost of evaluating Eq. 12 is only
Nβ -times more expensive than evaluating the
Hartree term.
Since Eq. 12 is evaluated stochastically, H (t)
exhibits fluctuations even when there is no perturbation. For a linear response in ∆, we therefore need to propagate two equations, with and
without the perturbation:

the time-dependent solutions of Eqs. 13 and
14 are different, we distinguish the Hamiltonians

stems purely from the stochastic fluctuations in H ∆=0 (t), as no external perturbing potential is applied. This fluctuation also

E. Numerical propagation of TDDFT with
stochastic exchange

We use a split operator approach for the numerical propagation of the TDDFT equation

6
with stochastic exchange. As usual, the perturbation is first applied at t = 0 (and we again
omit below the ∆ superscript):
φi (r, t = 0+ ) = e−i(r·ê)∆ φi (r)

(16)

and we then split the propagation of the nonlocal exchange and the remainder of the Hamiltonian,

the normalization is dependent on the initial
vector, Eq. (18) is slightly non-linear but this
is of little practical consequence. The primitive approach of Eq. (18) is sufficient since the
time-steps used are generally small, typically
dt = 0.05 a.u., i.e., around 1 as.

tion was performed using experimental molecular structure38 and the valence electronic
states were computed with Troullier-Martins
pseudopotentials.39 The total energy and the
eigenvalues were converged to 5meV with a real
space grid of 64 × 64 × 64 points and a 0.4 a0
grid spacing. Note that small molecular systems require, in general, a large range separation parameter and converge slower with the
grid size and spacing compared to large systems.
Through the tuning procedure,20,32,34 we found
that γ = 0.37 a−1
0 ; the resulting ionization potential (i.e., the negative of the HOMO energy)
is 10.4 eV, in excellent agreement with experiment (10.6 eV - Ref. 40).
The LUMO (obtained with the same range
separation parameter) is barely bound, by
slightly less than 0.1eV, but experimentally PH3
does not form a stable anion so the LUMO energy should be non-negative.
Using the optimally tuned BNL functional,
the optical cross-section σ (ω) was obtained (see
Eq. (A.6)) by deterministic and stochastic real
time propagations, and the results are shown
in Fig. 1. The TDDFT equations were propagated for a total time of 24 fs which provides
a spectral resolution of ∼170 meV. The computed absorption cross-section has a first peak
at E1 = 7.1 eV, in excellent agreement with the
first experimental peak at 7.0 eV.
The exciton binding energy is defined as
Eb = Eg − E1 ,

III.

RESULTS

For all systems studied here, we first perform
a ground-state DFT calculation and obtain the
range-separation parameter γ by enforcing the
piecewise linearity condition for the total energy; this ensures that the HOMO is the same
as the ionization energy.

Validation of the method using PH3 .

The smallest system studied is a PH3
molecule. Here, a deterministic DFT calcula-

(19)

where Eg is the fundamental band gap taken
as the difference between HOMO and LUMO
energies, i.e., Eg = 10.3 eV. The predicted PH3
binding energy is thus Eb = 3.2 eV, close to the
experimental value of 3.4 eV.41
The overall absorption maximum is at
11.5 eV, in good agreement with experiment
(12.0 eV), though the latter exhibits large peak
widths. At higher frequencies, the TDDFT
spectrum has multiple local maxima (e.g., at
16.5 and 20.4 eV) that in the experiment only
appear as shoulders. This is because experimental measurements cannot be resolved at energies
higher than the ionization threshold (10.4 eV).

area. Bottom: An initial segment of the time propagation showing the evolution of the induced dipole

The stochastic decomposition of the timedependent exchange (sTDDFT - Eq. 12) reproduces the deterministic results already for
Nβ = 2 (note that this is half the number used
in deterministic exchange, which involves four
valence states). We also checked that the spectrum does not change when the perturbation is
varied in the range ∆ = 10−4 − 10−3 a.u., as expected in linear response; this was also checked
for the phosphorene sheets, discussed next.

B.

Phosphorene Sheets: DFT

The major advantage of stochastic approaches is their applicability to large systems.
We demonstrate this feature now on a set of 2D
phosphorene sheets of increasing sizes, derived
from a black phosphorus crystal structure.43
The sheets were passivated with H atoms on
the rims; each P atom that would have been

bound to two H atoms was removed, resulting
in a compact sheet geometry. Note that the two
in-plane directions in the phosphorene sheet are
traditionally labeled as armchair and zig-zag.
With a kinetic energy cutoff of 26 Eh and a real
space grid with 208×136×40 points and a 0.6 a0
spacing, the Kohn-Sham eigenvalues were converged to 10 meV.
The smallest sheet is 0.6 × 0.8 nm and has
112 valence electrons. For its ground state
DFT calculations we employed both the deterministic and stochastic formulation of the
γ
exchange operator Xnl
. The optimally tuned
range-separation parameter for this sheet is
γ = 0.10 a−1
0 , and the stochastic eigenvalues
converge slowly with the number of stochastic
states, so Nξ ∼ 1600 is required to yield a statistical error of < 0.05 eV.
In addition to the small sheet, we considered
two larger sheets, 1.3 × 2.1 nm and 3.1 × 4.3 nm
(labeled “medium” and “big”), with 478 and
1958 valence electrons respectively. For these
larger sheets, the exchange operator was calculated purely stochastically as the deterministic calculation would have been very expensive.
The range separation parameter gradually decreases with system size as in other 1D and 3D
systems,32,44,45 so γ = 0.09a−1
0 in the mediumsize sheet and 0.05a−1
in
the
largest one. As the
0
range separation parameter decreases with sysγ
tem size, the long-range exchange operator Xnl
is numerically smaller and its stochastic representation has therefore a small absolute statistical error. Hence, the largest system requires a
smaller value of Nξ in the ground state calculations. Namely, the eigenvalues are converged to
< 50 meV with Nξ = 1600 stochastic states for
the medium-size sheet and only Nξ = 400 for
the largest one.
The stochastic-exchange DFT yields fundamental gaps Eg that decrease with system size:
Eg = 3.9, 3.1 and 1.7 eV for the three sheets
respectively. The large-sheet result is very similar to the HSE hybrid functional prediction of
1.5 eV.46 Comparing to with previous periodic
G0 W0 calculations (with a PBE starting point),
we find that the largest sheet is in rough but not
perfect agreement with the 2D periodic G0 W0

fundamental gap of 2.08 eV.47,48 The difference
from the GW result could be due to the scalar
(i.e., non-directional) nature of the range separated parameter, which ignores the difference
between the effective interactions in the in- and
out-of plane directions49 , and perhaps also due
to the approximate nature of the G0 W0 itself.
C.

Phosphorene sheets: TDDFT results

We next discuss the stability of TDDFT simulations for the sheets and the resulting optical
spectra. Since the wavefunction is only incremented gradually, by dt/2 = 0.025 a.u, the statistical fluctuation introduced by each stochastic decomposition of the exchange operator is
significantly smaller than for the ground state
calculation. Hence, as mentioned, a small Nβ
is sufficient for the time-dependent calculation,
so the short-time results are fairly accurate already for Nβ = 1 − 4 . However, Nβ influences

the total time of the simulations since due to
statistical fluctuations the propagation eventually becomes unstable. We verified that this instability is not influenced by the time step, grid
size and kinetic-energy cut-off.
We noticed the instability phenomena already
in our original stochastic TDDFT approach19
where, unlike here, we propagated only a few
stochastic combination of eigenstates (i.e., several β(r, t)), and constructed
P from them the
density as n(r, t) ' Nβ−1 β |β(r, t)|2 ). That
approach is extremely efficient for short time
simulations (where the plasmon response of systems with thousands of electrons is accurately
modeled by circa ten propagated states), but
is limited to short times since the propagation
eventually becomes unstable. Here, since all occupied eigenstates are propagated, and the density is constructed from all of them, the propagation is fairly stable for longer times.
Specifically, for the small and medium sheets,
with 112 and 478 valence electrons, the propagation was carried up to 1000 a.u (∼ 24 fs) without stability issues, using Nβ =2 . This is in line
with our previous simulations (Ref. 21) which
used a damped exchange (reduced by 80%) in
3D and were stable with Nβ = 1. However,
for the large sheet (with 1958 electrons) the
time evolution became numerically unstable after 260 a.u. (∼ 7 fs) even with Nβ =6. The
instability is for two reasons; first, the rapid oscillations of the density in the direction perpendicular to the phosphorene sheet. Unlike 3D
systems, the response here is highly anisotropic
and this appears to enhance the stochastic noise
in the time propagation. Hence, for large 2D
sheets the value of Nβ needs to be increased.
Further, the form of Eq. (12) is oscillatory even
for ∆ = 0; in future publications we would use a
less oscillatory form analogous to that in Ref. 21
and, in addition, would use a fully separable
form of the TDDFT calculations, analogous to
Eq. (10) for DFT with exchange.
Next, we turn to discuss the individual results. The time evolution of the induced dipole
for the three phosphorene sheets is shown in
Fig. 2. The absorption cross sections perelectron are shown in Fig. 3 for the zig-zag and

FIG. 3. The left panel shows the theoretical optical spectra of phosphorene sheets of increasing sizes:
0.6 × 0.8 nm (112 valence electrons), 1.3 × 2.1 nm (478 valence electrons) and 3.1 × 4.3 nm (1958 valence
electrons) marked by red, blue and black lines respectively for the zig-zag (top) and armchair (bottom)
directions. The right panel shows details of the low energy portion of the spectra; the yellow and dark-green
vertical lines indicate the positions of the fundamental band gap (Eg ) and the first excitonic peak (E1 ).
Experimental data for a bulk 2D monolayer phosphorene (taken from Ref.47 ) are shown in the bottom
graph by blue points. Features that lie between E1 and Eg correspond to multiple excitonic states.

armchair directions. The spectra are strongly
anisotropic, in agreement with experimental
data and GW /BSE calculations on 2D periodic
sheets.47,50–52 With rising system size there are
diminished quantum confinement effects so the
fundamental band gap decreases and the absorption maximum therefore gradually shifts to
lower energies. As the number of valence electrons increases the spectra also smoothens.
On the right panel of Fig. 3 we zoom on the
absorption spectrum below the ionization potential (which only slowly decreases with system size, from 5.9 to 5.4 eV). The absorption cross section decreases rapidly at lower
frequencies, but several local maxima are evident. Some of these local maxima are below
the band gap energy (Eg ) and therefore correspond to bound electron-hole pairs. These excitonic peaks appear only for the armchair direction (due to the strong anisotropy of the optical
response); this feature was seen in previous calculations for periodic phosphorene and was also
seen experimentally.47,50,53
Excitonic peaks are usually sharp and have
a high intensity, indicating long-lived quasiparticle states. The maxima in Fig. 3 are however broadened due to the finite simulation time

(24 fs for the two small systems and 7 fs for
the largest one). For the small sheet, the excitonic peaks are well-separated but have relatively low intensity. The position of the first absorption peak maximum (E1 ) changes with increasing system size from 1.8 to 1.6 eV. The latter is in good agreement with the experimental
value and GW /BSE estimates, 1.7 and 1.6 eV,
respectively47,48 for a bulk 2D system.
The exciton binding energy (Eq. 19) decreases rapidly with system size from 2.1 to
0.1 eV. The strongest excitonic response (the
largest amplitude of the E1 peak) is found in
the medium sized system, which also has a high
exciton binding energy Eb = 1.65 eV. As mentioned, however, the fundamental gap Eg in the
stochastic-exchange DFT is underestimated relative to G0 W0 calculations. Therefore, the exciton binding energy for the largest sheet (0.1 eV)
is much lower than predicted by GW /BSE calculations which give Eb = 0.48 eV.48
Interestingly, when the phosphorene is encapsulated in dielectric media, the GW /BSE binding energy becomes small, 0.14 eV48 , comparable to our TDDFT estimates of pristine (nonencapsulated) phosphorenes. The encapsulation causes strong screening above and below

10
the 2D system (i.e., in the out-of-plane direction) leading to a big change in the G0 W0 gap
Eg (from 2.08 to 1.62 eV, similar to our pristine
DFT gap), while the position of the first excitonic peak, E1 remains practically unaffected.48
The difference between our results and experiment and GW /BSE points to a problem in
describing 2D materials with range-separated
potentials,49 which should in principle account
for the anisotropy of the electron-electron interaction between the in- and out-of-plane directions. Until such a non-isotropic interaction
is implemented in DFT and TDDFT, stochastic
TDDFT with exchange can only be trusted as
far as the exciton frequency, but calculations of
the exciton binding would require a more accurate method than GKS-DFT for the quasiparticle gap.

IV.

CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we developed an efficient realtime TDDFT approach with stochastic longrange non-local exchange. The stochastic treatment decomposes the density matrix in TDDFT
to an average over a product of random vectors β in the space spanned by the occupied
orbitals. It significantly reduces the computational cost as only a few stochastic states are
needed at each time step. Further, the number
of stochastic states varies only a little with the
system size. Calculations for very large systems
thus become feasible.
The resulting TDDFT with long-range nonlocal exchange includes the attractive electronhole interaction that gives rise to exciton formation. Indeed, our TDDFT yields optical spectra that are in excellent agreement with experiment. For small systems, where deterministic
calculations are affordable, the stochastic and
deterministic results agree.
We demonstrated that our method is applicable for extremely big systems using a set of
phosphorene sheets containing up to ∼2000 valence electrons. The largest system was compared to experiments and previous calculations
on infinite phosphorene sheets; the analysis

confirms that the range-separated hybrid functional successfully predicts optical spectra even
with strong excitonic signatures.

APPENDIX I: PHOTOABSORPTION CROSS
SECTION

Here we overview for completeness the wellknown expression of the photoabsorption crosssection as a Fourier transform of a real-time
dipole correlation function.
The absorption cross section, σ(ω), is given
in linear response as1 :
σ (ω) =
ZZ
4π
ω
δṽ (r, ω) χ̃ (r, r0 , ω) δṽ (r0 , ω) dr dr0 ,
c
(A.1)
where tilde is used occasionally to denote quantities in frequency domain, δṽ (r, ω) is dynamical external potential and χ is the electronic
reducible polarizability, which is given in the
time domain as:
χ (r, r0 , t − t0 ) =

δn (r, t)
,
δv (r0 , t0 )

(A.2)

where δn (r, t) is the induced charge density at
a point r and time t. The response function is
causal, i.e., t > t0 . For absorption of polarized
light along a unit vector ê we apply δv as a
dipole potential. The cross section is then1

σ (ω) =

(ê · r)χ̃ (r, r0 , ω) · (ê · r0 ) dr dr0 .

Here, σ is calculated from real-time linearresponse. Specifically, the first stage is to apply
a dipole external potential perturbation
δν(r0 , t) = (ê · r0 )δ (t) ∆,

(A.4)

where ∆ is the perturbation strength, and an
instantaneous perturbation is applied at t = 0
allowing to probe the response at all frequencies. The perturbation potential is applied to
all occupied eigenstates, which are then propagated in time. The resulting oscillations of the
induced charge density (Eq. A.2) are then used
to find the dipole auto-correlation,

(ê · r) · δn (r, t) dr.

The absorption cross section is finally a Fourier
