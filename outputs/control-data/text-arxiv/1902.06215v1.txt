At low temperatures, microwave cavities are often preferred for the readout and control of a
variety of systems. In this paper, we present design and measurements on an optomechanical device based on a 3-dimensional rectangular waveguide cavity. We show that by suitably modifying
the electromagnetic field corresponding to the fundamental mode of the cavity, the equivalent circuit capacitance can be reduced to 29 fF. By coupling a mechanical resonator to the modified
electromagnetic mode of the cavity, we achieved a capacitance participation ratio of 43 %. We
demonstrate an optomechanical cooperativity, C ∼ 40, characterized by performing measurements
in the optomechanically-induced absorption (OMIA) limit. In addition, due to a low-impedance
environment between the two-halves of the cavity, our design has the flexibility of incorporating a
DC bias across the mechanical resonator, often a desired feature in tunable optomechanical devices.

INTRODUCTION

Cavity-optomechanical systems have demonstrated
an exquisite ability to control the quantum state of
massive-mechanical resonators. A prototypical cavityoptomechanical system consists of an electromagnetic
mode and a mechanical mode coupled by radiationpressure or coulombic-force. [1, 2]. Apart from improving the transduction sensitivity [3], these systems offer a
platform to control and manipulate the quantum state
of macroscopic mechanical resonators, and to implement
tailored interactions [4]. From earlier demonstrations of
achieving quantum ground state, both in optical and in
microwave domains [5, 6], design and technological advancements in these experimental systems have enabled
several milestones such as, capturing a single-microwave
photon and its storage in mechanical vibrations [7], nonreciprocal microwave circuits [8, 9], hybrid systems with
artificial atoms [10, 11], and quantum entanglement between two mechanical resonators [12, 13].
For optomechanical systems in microwave domain, a
common strategy is to couple a mechanically-compliant
capacitor to a lumped inductor, or to the distributed inductance of a coplanar waveguide cavity [14–18]. In this
context, 3-dimensional (3D) waveguide cavities provide a
unique platform. Due to their intrinsically higher coherence, there has been a lot of interest in using 3D cavities
for quantum devices [19]. Such cavities have been used
for the readout and manipulation of a wide variety of systems such as superconducting qubits [20], hybrid systems
for inter-frequency convertors [21], nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond [22], and magnons [23]. To achieve efficient coupling of these systems to electromagnetic field,
often one has to engineer the electromagnetic mode to
balance the electric and magnetic field components. Primarily due to a large mode volume, 3D cavities have
also been used to couple the motion of mm-sized SiNmembrane resonators demonstrating high cooperativity
and quantum ground state of motion [24, 25]. How-

ever, in these systems, large parasitic capacitance in the
microwave design, and non-lithographic device assembly techniques limit the achieved single photon coupling
strength.
In this work, we demonstrate an optomechanical platform based on a 3D-waveguide cavity, where the resonant mode can be engineered to minimize the parasitic
capacitance, and thereby achieve a high participation of
the mechanically-compliant capacitance. These design
guidelines can further be used to develop similar systems
with novel materials such as graphene, NbSe2 , and to develop hybrid systems with other superconducting circuits
while reducing fabrication complexities of the microwave
part [18, 26, 27]. Moreover, our optomechanical system
allows to incorporate a DC voltage bias across the mechanically compliant capacitor, thus providing a tunability of mechanical and cavity modes without requiring additional on-chip filter circuitry. The design and low temperature measurements on such a system are described
in the following sections.

SIMULATIONS AND DESIGN

The central idea behind this implementation is to modify the electromagnetic field corresponding to the fundamental TE101 mode of a rectangular waveguide cavity in
a manner that maximizes the electric field at its center.
A typical distribution of surface charge-current for the
fundamental mode is shown in Fig. 1(a). The magnitude of the current drops towards the center of the top
and bottom surfaces of the cavity. This is balanced by
a corresponding displacement current flowing across the
bottom and top surfaces. This suggests that one possible way to maximize the electric field at the center of the
cavity could be to direct the charge current towards this
region. This is achieved by electrically connecting two
electrodes from the middle of the two surfaces (top and
bottom), and bringing them closer towards the center,

as shown schematically in Fig. 1(b). Thus, an optomechanical system can be formed by placing a mechanically
compliant capacitor at the center of the cavity and galvanically connecting its leads to the cavity walls.
Fig. 1(c) shows the equivalent lumped element model,
where the “modified-cavity” environment is represented
as a complex admittance. The added mechanically
compliant capacitor is simulated as a capacitance Cm ,
which further lowers the resonant frequency of the mode.
By applying Foster’s theorem for a loss-less network,
the complex-admittance offered by the cavity environment can be decomposed to the equivalent lumped elements [28]. The mode frequencies ω0 ’s of the system
are determined by the zeros of the imaginary part of
the total admittance, defined by Yt (ω) = Im[Ỹt (ω)] =
Yp (ω) + ωCm [28, 29]. Further, the mode impedance is
determined from the positive slope at zero crossing, i.e.,

−1

Z = ω20 dω
(Im[Ỹt (ω)])|ω0
. The capacitance Cp and
inductance Lp of the corresponding mode are then calculated from Z and ω0 .
We perform numerical simulations to determine the
eigen-frequencies with such a major modification to the
cavity geometry that extends beyond perturbative analysis [29]. With an objective to minimize the parasitic
capacitance (cavity-mode capacitance Cp ), we start with
a 7 mm × 4 mm × 7 mm (dimensions along the x, y, z
axes as shown in Fig. 1(a)) cavity which has a fundamental resonance mode at 30.3 GHz. We then incorporate a

3 mm × 4 mm × 0.3 mm (corresponding to the x, y, z
axes) silicon chip at the center of the cavity. The chip
is designed with a 7 µm wide electrode having a 25 µm
gap at the middle of the cavity. The electrode runs all
the way up to the cavity surfaces, forming an electrical short. In the gap between the electrode pattern, we
define a lumped port to simulate the admittance seen
by the mechanical resonator. The complete geometry is
represented in Fig. 1(b) and an image of a real system is
shown in Fig. 2(a).
Using finite element methods, we then numerically
compute the complex admittance of the environment
Ỹp (ω) as seen from this port. In a real device, of course,
the port is replaced by a mechanical capacitor and an
effective electromagnetic cavity mode is formed by combining a mechanical capacitance Cm to the complex admittance Ỹp (ω). Since the typical size of the mechanical
capacitor is much smaller than the wavelength of the microwave signals, it justifies the choice of a lumped port
at the center.
The simulations were performed for various cavity dimensions and device geometries, in order to have a system with a maximum participation ratio. Fig. 1(d) shows
plots of the imaginary parts of admittance of the cavity
environment Yp (ω), and total admittance Yt (ω) in presence of an added mechanical capacitance of 26 fF for
the dimensions mentioned earlier. The connecting electrodes have an effect of lowering the bare cavity TE101
mode to 12.5 GHz. The frequency gets reduced further

to 9.1 GHz when the mechanical capacitance is added, as
indicated by the first zero-crossing with a positive slope
in Fig. 1(d). From the slope at the first root of Yt (ω),
we estimated a cavity capacitance Cp ∼ 29 fF and an
inductance Lp ∼ 5.43 nH. For an optomechanical device
with Cm = 23 fF, it corresponds to a mode impedance
of 485 Ω. A summary of simulation results for cavities of
different sizes and electrode widths is listed in Table 1.
Additional simulation results are included in the supplemental material (SM)[30].
It is interesting to point out here that a large lumped
capacitance at the center of the cavity leads to a significant modification of the eigen-modes such that most
of the electric field remains concentrated between the
lumped capacitor plates. However, the mode still retains
some characteristics of a waveguide field distribution, and
can be called a lumped-distributive mode, corroborating
well with higher harmonics appearing with large spectral
range as seen in Fig. 1(d).

DEVICE FABRICATION AND ASSEMBLY

0.0

For experimental realization, rectangular waveguide
cavities of size 7 mm × 4 mm × 7 mm were machined
using 6061-T5 aluminum alloy, having diamond polished
interior surfaces as shown in Fig. 2(a). A more detailed
image of the cavity assembly is provided in SM. The bare
cavity has a fundamental mode frequency of 30.3 GHz,
approximately. In order to lower the electromagnetic
mode frequency to within our measurement bandwidth of
4-8 GHz, the mechanical resonator, serving the role of an
added capacitor must be designed appropriately. To sufficiently load the electromagnetic mode capacitively, two
drumhead-shaped mechanical resonators having their capacitances in parallel were designed. Each resonator has
a diameter of 22 µm, a gap of 300 nm from the bottom
capacitor plate, and is patterned with a 7 µm wide connecting electrode. This accounts for approximately 23 fF
mechanically compliant capacitance, potentially lowering
the cavity mode frequency to ∼ 9.4 GHz.
The mechanical resonator device was fabricated on a
high resistivity ( > 10 kΩ-cm) silicon substrate using multiple steps of optical lithography. The bottom and top

electrodes were patterned on 100 nm aluminum films deposited by e-beam evaporation and dc sputtering methods, respectively. The deposition parameters for the top
electrode were systematically investigated and optimized

4
to obtain films of high tensile stress. A tilted angle image of one of the mechanical resonators in the drumhead
shape is shown in Fig. 2(b). To increase the mechanical
capacitance, we pattern two drumhead shaped mechanical resonators having their capacitance in parallel. Such
a sample is then placed inside a two port microwave cavity. Patterned electrodes on the chip were wire-bonded
to the cavity surface using aluminum wires of 25 µm diameter. A complete assembly of the device is shown in
Fig. 2(a).

MEASUREMENTS AND ANALYSIS

The assembled cavity was mounted to the mixing
chamber plate of a dilution refrigerator and cooled down
to the base temperature of 20 mK. A sufficiently attenuated input signal was used to drive the cavity and the
transmitted signal was first amplified using a low-noiseamplifier and then measured using a vector network analyzer (VNA). In presence of the drumhead-shaped mechanical resonators, the fundamental mode of the cavity
was recorded at ωc ∼ 2π × 6.31 GHz with a total line
width of κ = 2π × 481 kHz, as shown in Fig. 2(c). From
simulations of the coupling ports, we estimated input and
output coupling rates of 96 kHz and 330 kHz, respectively. Since most of the electric field remains in vacuum
between the parallel plates of the capacitor, an internal cavity decay rate of 55 kHz is encouraging for future
experiments in the quantum regime of motion. As the
measured frequency is far off from the simulated value,
we suspect the wirebonds (∼ 2.5 mm long on each side)
add a significant inductance to the cavity mode. Kinetic
inductance, and reduction in the gap of the mechanical
capacitor due to thermal contraction could also be playing a minor role.
The mechanical drumhead resonators and the optomechanical coupling were characterized by performing measurements in the optomechanically induced transparency
(OMIT) configuration, wherein two microwave signals
are used : a strong pump signal near ωc − ωm and a weak
probe signal near ωc , where ωc and ωm are the cavity
and mechanical resonant frequencies, respectively [31].
In the sideband resolved limit (ωm > κ), the presence
of two signals detuned by ωm exerts a beating radiation
pressure force on the mechanical resonator, thereby driving it at its resonant frequency. The coherent motion of
the mechanical resonator up-converts the sideband signal to exactly the probe frequency ωp . The resulting
optomechanical interaction between the microwave field
and drum motion manifests in the form of a narrow absorption (OMIA) or a transmission (OMIT) window in
an otherwise smooth cavity response.
Fig. 3(a) shows the cavity response measured in an
OMIT configuration wherein, a sharp dip at the cavity
frequency ωc is observed. A small feature near 6.312 GHz

corresponds to the second mechanical mode. In presence
of a pump tone at the lower sideband (ωd = ωc − ωm ),
the cavity transmission is given by,

where ηL and ηR are the coupling efficiencies of the input

and output ports, ∆ = ωp −ωc , C = κγ0 md is the optomechanical cooperativity, nd is the number of pump photons, κ and γm are the cavity and mechanical linewidths,
respectively. Measurement results shown in Fig. 3(a)
were fitted using Eq. 1. From these measurements, we
determine the following parameters for the two mechanical modes: ωm1 = 2π × 5.23 MHz, ωm2 = 2π × 7.35 MHz,
intrinsic linewidths of γm1 = 2π × 250 Hz and γm2 =
2π × 200 Hz.
At low pump powers, the linewidth of the OMIA
feature is predominantly determined by intrinsic losses
in the mechanical resonator, and the magnitude of the
cavity transmission at the OMIA feature drops by a
1
. At higher pump powers, the optomefactor of 1+C
chanical damping dominates, leading to a broadening of
the OMIA feature as the strength of pump tone is increased, as shown in Fig. 3(b). Thus, a measurement
of the optomechanically-induced absorption feature can
directly be used to estimate the optomechanical cooperativity. Figs. 3(c) and (d) show the variation of cooperativity for the two mechanical modes. The number of
pump photons nd were estimated from the known losses
in the input chain. The errors bars result from the numerical fits performed using Eq. 1 to the complete cavity response. From the linear variation of C with nd
at low powers, we estimated a single photon coupling
strength g0 /2π of 8.0 Hz, and 6.5 Hz for the two mechanical modes, which are close to the simulated values
of ∼ 8.9 Hz, and ∼ 7.5 Hz. At high pump powers, the
sub-linear variation of the cooperativity stems from the
increase in cavity dissipation rate.
It is interesting to contrast this behavior with a device fabricated and assembled differently. A mechanical
resonator of 17 µm diameter with a gap of ∼300 nm,
patterned with a 50 µm wide connecting electrode was
coupled to a 28 mm × 6 mm × 28 mm cavity. In this device, we use indium bump pads (instead of wire-bonds) to
make galvanic connection to the cavity walls, which were
tightly pressed by the other half. A variation of cooperativity with nd for this device is shown in Fig. 3(e). With
this approach, we are able to achieve a higher dynamic
range, and even at the highest pump powers no sublinear
variation in cooperativity was noticed. This observation
suggests the potential role of current crowding near the
cavity walls in wire-bonded devices.

mechanical resonator (device 2) placed inside a 28 mm × 6 mm × 28 mm cavity. The highest values of cooperativity measured
on the two devices differ due to the dynamic range of the two cavities.

TUNABLE OPTOMECHANICAL DEVICE

The applicability of an optomechanical system can be
extended by tuning the mechanically compliant capacitor with a DC voltage. Such systems could enable in-situ
tuning of the mechanical modes and potentially have applications in deterministic capture of quantum information [32]. Incorporating a DC bias in a microwave cavity
while maintaining low internal losses at microwave frequencies is challenging. For broadband operations, it requires heavy on-chip reflective filtering on the DC-port
[32]. For near-resonant operation, specially engineered
devices exploiting the voltage nodes of the resonator have
been attempted [33, 34].
The large capacitance between the two halves of a 3D
waveguide cavity naturally offers a low-impedance environment around the electromagnetic mode of the cavity.
Based on the physical dimensions of cavity-halves, we
estimated a capacitance of 250 pF between them, suggesting a possibility of applying a DC-voltage via the two
halves. We introduce a DC voltage in our optomechanical
device by electrically isolating the two halves of the cavity by a thin-insulating layer [35]. A representative image
of cavity assembly, along with a schematic of such a device is shown in Fig. 4(a). Electrical isolation obtained
between the two parts of the cavity enables the appli-

cation of a DC voltage across the mechanical capacitor.
Further, a low frequency RF signal can be added using a
bias tee at low temperatures, facilitating a direct drive of
0
the mechanical resonator given by the force Cm Vdc Vac ,
where Vac and Vdc are the amplitudes of RF and DC signals, respectively. For mechanical readout, a microwave
tone at ωc is injected into the cavity, and the transmitted
signal is then demodulated and recorded at room temperature, while the mechanical resonator is driven by a low
frequency RF signal. To reduce any RF-leakage to the
output chain, we added two 4-8 GHz bandpass filters before the low noise amplifiers, yielding a 80 dB suppression
of low frequency signals. We measured an insertion loss
of ∼ 34dB between the input microwave port and DC
port of the cavity.
On characterization of microwave cavity, the internal
linewidth was measured to be κi ∼ 1 MHz. Further
details on the cooperativity and single photon coupling
strength of this system are provided in the SM. Fig. 4(b)
shows the measurements from a device assembled to have
a DC-voltage across the mechanical resonator. While directly driving it with a low-frequency RF signal, the mechanical response shows a linewidth of γm /2π = 29 Hz.
The DC voltage allows us to tune the mechanical resonant frequency by electrostatic-pulling. Fig. 4(c) shows
the parabolic variation in drum frequency with an applied
gate voltage. Such a “negative-dispersion” of resonant

CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK

To summarize, we described a scheme to couple
nano/micro-mechanical resonators to a waveguide cavity. The design guidelines discussed here, help to minimize the parasitic capacitance, an important criterion
to improve single-photon coupling strength. Our design,
along with the ability to add a DC voltage can easily be
extended to optomechanical systems with novel materials such as graphene, NbSe2 , BSCCO, etc to study their
intrinsic performance, phase-transitions, or to further improve the single-photon coupling rate, while much simplifying the related nano-fabrication. Looking forward,
by reducing the separation between the capacitor plates,
we will be able to improve the single-photon coupling
rate to ≈ 200 Hz for a gap of 60 nm. Together with the
large dynamic range of 3D cavities, this would let us perform experiments near the ultra-strong coupling limit,
enabling the study of quantum behavior of massive mechanical resonators.
