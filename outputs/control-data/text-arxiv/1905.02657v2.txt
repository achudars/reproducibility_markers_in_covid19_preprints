Homogeneous and isotropic turbulent fields obtained from two Direct Numerical Simulation databases (with
ReŒª equal to 150 and 418) were seeded with point particles that moved with the local fluid velocity to
obtain Lagrangian pressure histories. Motivated by cavitation inception modeling, the statistics of events in
which such particles undergo low-pressure fluctuations were computed, parameterized by the amplitude of
the fluctuations and by their duration. The main results are the average frequencies of these events and the
probabilistic distribution of their duration, which are of predictive value. A connection is also established
between these average frequencies and the pressure probability density function, thus justifying experimental
methods proposed in the literature. Further analyses of the data show that the occurrence of very-low-pressure
events is highly intermittent and is associated with worm-like vortical structures of length comparable to the
integral scale of the flow.

INTRODUCTION

The study of pressure fluctuations in turbulent flows
has been the subject of significant theoretical, numerical
and experimental work over more than eight decades.
Over the years, much knowledge has been gained about
the intensity of the fluctuations, their scaling properties,
their energy spectrum and probability density function
(PDF) as well as about their spatial structure and their
relation to other flow variables. The reader is referred,
among others, to the works of George et al1 , Pumir2 ,
Cao et al3 , Gotoh & Rogallo4 and references therein for
further details.
Pressure fluctuations have important practical consequences in many physical situations, since they intervene
in the forces exerted by the fluid on adjacent and immersed bodies and are also key to acoustic noise. The
specific motivation of the study reported herein is the
phenomenon of incipient cavitation in turbulent liquid
flows, which is a macroscopic consequence of pressure
fluctuations on microscopic bubbles (or nuclei) present in
the liquid5,6 . Though the dynamics of cavitation bubbles
has been well established following the pioneering work
of Plesset7 , accurate prediction of cavitation inception in
technologically relevant flows remains a challenge8,9 .
A seminal work on cavitation inception in turbulent
flows was published in 1979 by Arndt & George10 . It
puts forward the main ingredients for turbulence-induced
inception: That the cavitation nuclei are subject to pressure fluctuations as measured in a Lagrangian frame, and
that (a) the pressure must dip below a critical level (pcav ,
the cavitation pressure, also called Blake threshold11 ),
and (b) the low pressure must persist below the critical
level for a time that exceeds the time scale for bubble
growth. The picture has been confirmed and enriched
over the years by several authors12‚Äì15 , including the role
of coherent structures and the possibility of using incip-

ient cavitation bubbles as pressure sensors.
Typically, cavitation inception is defined by the inception cavitation index œÉi = (pref,i ‚àí pcav )/( 21 œÅU 2 ), where
pref,i is the value of the reference pressure of the flow
at which cavitating nuclei first become observable, œÅ is
the liquid‚Äôs density and U the global velocity scale. By
observable it is meant that the frequency of cavitation
events growing bubbles to a large enough size is high
enough to be experimentally detectable. In view of criteria (a) and (b) above, inception modeling thus requires
knowledge about the frequency Œ∂ at which random turbulent fluctuations take the pressure, as experienced by
the minute nuclei transported by the flow, below pcav for
long enough time. Such knowledge is, however, not as yet
available in the literature. The purpose of this contribution is to provide data about Œ∂ in the simplest turbulent
flow, homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT). As such,
the results are related to the so-called homogeneous nucleation of cavitation, in which the events take place far
away from walls. To address heterogeneous nucleation
one should increase at least one step further the complexity of the flow and consider boundary layer turbulence.
The pressure PDF in HIT is known to be negatively skewed and exhibit an exponential tail at very low
pressures2‚Äì4 .On the basis of physical intuition, several
authors have argued that the frequency Œ∂(Œ¥p) of pressure
fluctuations below Œ¥p should also exhibit an exponential
tail for large and negative Œ¥p10,12,14 . Mathematically, this
is far from obvious. In fact, consider a p(t) that exhibits
logarithmic pulses of the form ln(t ‚àí ti ) where t1 , t2 , . . .
are random times which arise with average frequency f .
It is easy to check that in such a case PDF(p) has an
exponential tail for p  0. However, the frequency Œ∂(Œ¥p)
is not exponential, as it equals f for any (sufficiently
negative) Œ¥p. The temporal structure of the pressure excursions is thus crucial in determining the statistics of
occurrence of low pressure events.

Having in mind cavitation modeling, in this investigation we perform Lagrangian sampling of two Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) databases counting events at
which the particles go below some given pressure threshold Œ¥p for a longer time than some given minimum duration d ‚â• 0. Notice that each excursion, even if the
pressure dives well below Œ¥p for a time much greater
than d, is counted as a single event. The rationale behind this is that, if the given Œ¥p and d are likely to produce cavitation of the particle (nucleus), then the gaseous
phase will violently grow and increase the local pressure
so that no similar event will take place within the same
pressure excursion. The results obtained from our Lagrangian counting experiments confirm the exponential
dependence Œ∂(Œ¥p) ' C exp(Œ≤Œ¥p) for Œ¥p  0. The factors C and Œ≤ are retrieved by fitting the data. We also
address the random structure of the pressure fluctuation
events by building the PDF of interarrival times. It shows
that that low-pressure events do not behave as a Poisson
process, exhibiting a marked burstiness that increases as
Œ¥p becomes more negative. It is appropriate to point
out that, since the tracking method does not incorporate
any relative velocity between the Lagrangian particles
and the fluid, the results only apply to the smallest cavitation nuclei.

DEFINITIONS AND METHODS

Two databases containing Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) results of Forced Homogeneous Isotropic Turbulence (FHIT) were queried. They consist of fully resolved numerical solutions of the incompressible NavierStokes equations in a periodic domain, with forcing applied to a narrow band of low wavenumber modes in such
a way that a statistically steady flow develops.
The DNS results are time series of velocity and pressure spatial fields with zero mean from which statistical
averages of kinetic energy hKi and viscous dissipation
hi were computed. From these values the basic scales
characterizing each flow were defined as:
Ô£±
q
Ô£≤Velocity scale: u0 = 2hKi ,
q3
(1)
0
Ô£≥Length scale:
Œª = u 15ŒΩ ,
hi

where ŒΩ is the kinematic viscosity and unit density is
used. The length scale so defined is the Taylor length
microscale. With these two basic scales all variables were
rescaled (non-dimensionalized), dividing velocities by u0 ,
lengths by Œª, pressures by œÅu02 , times by Œª/u0 , etc. All
reference to the DNS data made throughout this article
concerns the scaled (dimensionless) variables. In particular, the scaled velocity field u satisfies
hkuk2 i = 3,

hk‚àá √ó uk2 i = 15.

(2)

The non-dimensional parameter that characterizes the
flow is the Reynolds number ReŒª = u0 Œª/ŒΩ. Two values were considered: ReŒª = 150, obtained from the

database maintained by J. JimeÃÅnez and coworkers at
Univ. PoliteÃÅcnica Madrid16 , and ReŒª = 418, obtained
from the Johns Hopkins Turbulence Databases17‚Äì19 .
Notice that, under this scaling, the Kolmogorov
scales20 are given by

The Lagrangian trajectories are computed by numerically solving the equation

(4)

from time t = 0 to t = T , with initial condition r(0) =
X, for a large number M of initial positions, i.e., X ‚àà
X = {X1 , X2 , . . . , XM }. The adopted time-integration
method is a Runge-Kutta scheme of order ‚â• 2, with a
time step much smaller than the Kolmogorov time scale
(‚àÜt < 0.05œÑK ). The required spatial interpolation was
accomplished using Lagrangian polynomial interpolants
of degree three or greater, depending on the case.
Along the set of computed trajectories several statistical estimates were computed by averaging over the Lagrangian samples (parameterized by the set X of initial
positions) and over time. For these estimates to be meaningful recommended practices were followed 21 . The initial positions were uniformly distributed over the simulation domain, keeping them at least 2.5 grid spacings
apart. The integration time T extended over several eddy
turnover times. Specifically, the ReŒª = 150 field (resolution 2563 , time step 0.043) was sampled with M = 106
particles during a time T = 869.1 (114 turnover times).
The ReŒª = 418 field (resolution 10243 , time step 0.012),
on the other hand, was sampled with M = 4 √ó 105 particles during a time T = 60.7, which corresponds to 5
turnover times.
In incompressible turbulence Lagrangian averages of
spatial quantities (e.g., kinetic energy, enstrophy, etc.)
coincide with Eulerian averages. Due to the finite number of Lagrangian particles and the finite simulation time,
especially in the case with ReŒª = 418, the estimates obtained by averaging over the particles and over time are
not exact. The difference of our estimates with Eulerian
averages can be used as a simple test of statistical significance. The error in the rms values of velocity and
vorticity were smaller than 2%, value recommended by
Yeung21 , providing some validation of our sampling procedure.
The Lagrangian ‚ÄúTaylor‚Äù timescale of a variable Y is

where Var(¬∑) denotes the variance of the corresponding

All the statistical averages in the previous and forthcoming definitions are of course replaced by estimates computed over the numerical approximation of the sampled
trajectories.
Finally, the occurrence of low pressure events was investigated as follows: Some negative pressure values p‚àí
were chosen, namely -2, -2.05, -2.1, etc. Notice that
these correspond to non-dimensional fluctuations, since
hpi = 0. For a given value of p‚àí , a Lagrangian particle was defined as undergoing a low-pressure event with
threshold p‚àí that starts at time tstart if its pressure satisfies p(tstart ) = p‚àí and Dp/Dt(tstart ) < 0. The end
of the event is defined as the first time tend such that
p(tend ) = p‚àí and Dp/Dt(tend ) > 0. The duration of the
event is defined as tend ‚àí tstart .
In this way, given m particles evolving in a turbulent field, a stochastic counting process n(p‚àí , d, t) can
be defined as the number of low-pressure events (with
threshold p‚àí and duration tend ‚àí tstart > d) that have
0 < tstart < t. For each threshold p‚àí and each minimum duration d, the number n(p‚àí , d, T ) of events was
computed from the time history of the M Lagrangian
particles that are traced over the time T of the simulation. From this, we computed an estimate for the rate of
such events as

RESULTS
Basic statistics

We first report some basic statistical quantities obtained from the computed Lagrangian pressure histories.
These include the pressure PDFs shown in Fig. 1, together with the quantities summarized Table I.
The results for Var(p) are similar to those of Gotoh &

which decreases to about 0.7 at ReŒª = 172. Cao et al3

Average frequency of pressure fluctuation events

an average frequency of events per particle.

of Œ∂ below 10‚àí6 are reported because for this value the

relative statistical error is already at 20% for the higher
Re.
A typical use of these data would be as follows: Consider a volume V of fluid in a (homogeneous, isotropic)
turbulent flow characterized by given values of u0 , Œª
and ReŒª , and assume that the fluid contains some concentration Z of small particles (per m3 ) in suspension.
Then F = ZV Œ∂(p‚àí , d)u0 /Œª is the expected frequency (in
events/sec) with which the suspended particles will undergo negative pressure fluctuations below œÅu02 p‚àí (in Pa)
that last more than dŒª/u0 (in sec) within the volume V .
Of course for this to hold the quantity Œ∂(p‚àí , d) must be
evaluated at the flow‚Äôs ReŒª .
Going back to Figure 3, notice that for any minimum
duration d the average frequency is approximately exponential in p‚àí , i.e., Œ∂(p‚àí ) ' C exp(Œ≤ p‚àí ), with C and Œ≤
depending on d and on ReŒª . In fact, some upward concavity can be observed in the semilog plots for the higher
values of p‚àí (milder pressure fluctuations), but for lower
values the plots closely follow straight lines. This can be
more easily seen in Fig. 4, in which all plots of Œ∂(p‚àí , d)
corresponding to d = 0, 1, 2, . . . , 6 for both values of ReŒª
have been put together simultaneously with their exponential fits.
The fitted values of C and Œ≤ are listed in Table II. Most
relevant is the parameter Œ≤, i.e., the slope in the semilog plots. A smaller Œ≤ implies that, as the threshold is
lowered, the average rate of excursions below the threshold decreases more slowly. For any minimum duration
of the excursions, Œ≤ is smaller for the higher Reynolds
number. This is consistent with the pressure PDFs,
which also show that lower pressures become more probable at higher ReŒª , with exponential tails that behave as
exp(Œ≥p‚àí ), with Œ≥ = 1.1 at ReŒª = 150 and Œ≥ = 0.65 at
ReŒª = 418 (see Fig. 1).

By direct inspection of Table II one notices that Œ≥ is,
for both ReŒª , close to the parameter Œ≤ that corresponds
to events of minimum duration d between 0 and 1 (i.e.,
between zero and roughly four Kolmogorov time scales).
The experimental consequences of this are quite interesting. Assume that, as proposed by LaPorta et al14 ,
one uses the gas nuclei in a liquid as pressure sensors
and measures the average rate of cavitation events as a
function of the (variable) reference pressure pref of the
flow. Then, if the nuclei‚Äôs reaction time is smaller than
a few Kolmogorov time scales, the curve cavitation rate
vs. (pcav ‚àí pref ) will be approximately proportional to

tial, to PDF(pcav ‚àí pref ) itself. This has been argued in
the literature by several authors10,12,14 on the basis of
physical intuition and is herein rigorously confirmed. Notice that the short reaction time of the nuclei is crucial
for the proportionality Œ∂(p‚àí ) ‚àº PDF(p‚àí ) to hold. If the
reaction time is larger than, say, 20 œÑK (corresponding to
d ' 5), the dependence of the cavitation rate with pressure will largely differ from that of the pressure PDF. It
is worth mentioning that the values of Œ≤ inferred by LaPorta et al14 , which were in the range 0.14-0.22 for ReŒª
between 1658 and 1880, suggest that Œ≤ keeps decreasing
with ReŒª in much the same way as observed from the
DNS databases studied here.
The dependence of Œ∂ with the minimum duration d
of the events is depicted in Fig. 5. An approximately
exponential decay of Œ∂ with d is observed for d greater
than a few œÑK (say, d > 0.5), with a logarithmic slope
that becomes more negative as the threshold p‚àí is lowered. For any p‚àí the average rate of long events increases

It is informative to complement the previous results
with further analysis of the distribution of the duration
(tend ‚àí tstart ) of the events corresponding to each threshold p‚àí . The corresponding PDFs are shown in Fig. 6.
It is observed that the peak of the PDF is always about
2/3 of œÑK and that the PDFs for each p‚àí have longer
tails for the larger ReŒª . As p‚àí decreases the distribution
becomes narrower, i.e., events that last longer than œÑK
become increasingly improbable. The means and medians of these PDFs are shown as functions of p‚àí in Fig.
7. They increase significantly with ReŒª , contrary to what
happens with the peak of the duration PDFs.

For the purpose of both completeness and comparison, let us close this section with plots of Œ∂(p+ , d), corresponding to positive pressure fluctuations. They are
shown in Fig. 8. It is evident that positive pressure
excursions are much more rare than negative ones, a result that is consistent with the rapid decay of the positive side of the pressure PDF. For minimum duration
d = 0 the rate of events does not change much with ReŒª ,
but for events significantly longer than 10 Kolmogorov
timescales (d > 2.58) the non-dimensional frequency for
ReŒª = 418 is much greater than that for ReŒª = 150, by
an order of magnitude or more.

The occurrence of low-pressure fluctuations (of threshold p‚àí and minimum duration d) in a turbulent flow
is certainly a random process. Its stochastic properties
can be investigated looking at the arrival process formed
(1)
(2)
by the (monotone increasing) sequence tstart , tstart , . . .,
(i)
where tstart is the starting time of the i-th event. This
generates the stochastic process of interarrival times,
(i+1)
(i)
Di = tstart ‚àí tstart . If m random particles are seeded
into the flow, then by definition the average interarrival
time satisfies D = 1/(mŒ∂(p‚àí , d)). A totally random arrival process (Poisson process) exhibits an exponential
distribution for D, i.e.,

Whether the sequence of low-pressure events is a Poisson
process or not can thus be assessed by inspecting the
PDF of interarrival times. This PDF cannot be built
from the raw data consisting of all events undergone by
the M particles because of the temporal resolution limit
imposed by the simulation time step. For example, for
the case of events with p‚àí = ‚àí2 and d = 0 the total
number of such events recorded was 2.11 √ó 107 for the
simulation at ReŒª = 150 (M = 106 ) and 3.43 √ó 105 for
that at ReŒª = 418 (M = 4√ó105 ). Meanwhile, the number
of simulated time steps is 20,000 and 5,000, respectively.
This makes the interarrival times to be much smaller than
the time step and thus poorly resolved.
The procedure adopted to build P DF (D) was as follows: From the M particles in the simulation, batches
of m particles were extracted at random, selecting the
number m such that D equals 100 simulation time steps.

for comparison. Results at (a) ReŒª = 150 and (b) ReŒª = 418.

For each batch the interarrival times were computed, and
PDF(D) was obtained averaging the histograms of 50,000
such batches.
The results considering events of any duration (d = 0)
for each pressure threshold are shown in Fig. 9, where
we plot D PDF(D) as a function of D/D. Also shown
is the exponential distribution exp(‚àíD/D) which would
correspond to a Poisson process. Analogous PDFs can
be built for other values of d, but they are not shown
since they are quite similar.
The first immediate observation from the plots of
PDF(D) is that low-pressure events do not take place
as a totally random, Poisson process that would entail

an exponential PDF. The semilog-plots of the PDFs of
interarrival times exhibit an upward concavity, or ‚Äúheavy
tail‚Äù, which becomes more prominent as the threshold p‚àí
is decreased. This heavy tail is characteristic of processes
that exhibit burstiness, for which a popular quantitative
measure in the literature is the ‚Äúburstiness parameter‚Äù23
defined by

,
œÉ(D) + D

(11)

where œÉ(D) is the standard deviation of D. Notice that
B = ‚àí1 for a periodic process (œÉ(D) = 0), B = 0 for
a Poisson process (œÉ(D) = D), and B = 1 for a highly

bursty process (œÉ(D)  D). The graphs of B vs. p‚àí
fixing the minimum duration to d = 0 are shown in Fig.
10 for both ReŒª considered. Clearly, the low-pressure
events are more bursty for larger fluctuations (more negative p‚àí ). To visualize this, in Fig. 11 we plot, as a
function of time, the number of events that start in temporal bins of 50 time steps for p‚àí = ‚àí2 and p‚àí = ‚àí11
in the simulation with ReŒª = 150. The number of events
per bin with threshold -2 oscillates moderately around
its mean value, while that with threshold -11 is most of
the time near zero with intermittent bursts that reach 30
or more events per bin. It is remarkable that burstiness
parameters of value 0.3 and higher are observed. Such
values are not frequent in natural phenomena, and can
be found in highly intermittent human activities such as
e-mail sending23 .

FIG. 10. Burstiness parameter of the low-pressure events as
a function of the threshold pressure p‚àí for the two ReŒª considered.

The high burstiness of very-low-pressure events is an
indication of large flow structures being involved in them,
such that when one of these structures appears many particles go through it and bursts of events take place. This
picture is consistent with the intermittent structures of
intense vorticity, or worms, first described by JimeÃÅnez et
al24 , which have lengths of the order of the integral scale
of the flow. To confirm this, we looked at the pressure isosurfaces of the ReŒª = 418 simulation, for which a burst
of low-pressure events takes place for non-dimensional
times between 6 and 18 (the burst thus lasts about 46
Kolmogorov timescales). The isosurfaces are shown in
Fig. 12 at some selected instants. The lightest surfaces,
corresponding to p = ‚àí2, are present in all snapshots
as expected from the low value of B for p‚àí = ‚àí2. At
time t = 6.4 a vortical structure develops, which is most
evident at the peak of the burst (between t = 9.1 and
11.8, third and fourth frames in the figure). It is within
this structure that very low pressures (-8 or lower) oc-

cur and affect numerous Lagrangian particles. By time
14.4 this structure is dissolving away and after the burst,
at t = 25.1, the flow has recovered an isosurface pattern similar to the one observed before the burst. We
have checked that the vertical low-pressure structure is
indeed a high vorticity region, and its shape and length
are in agreement with the intermittent worms reported
in the literature (notice that the integral lengthscale for
this flow is 12.1, roughly 1/5 the box edgelength)24 .

CONCLUSIONS

Motivated by cavitation inception modeling, this work
reports some Lagrangian statistics of the pressure field in
forced homogeneous isotropic turbulence. It is clear that
for a cavitation nucleus to grow up to detectable size a
pressure fluctuation that takes it to sufficiently low pressures for long enough time is necessary. However, the
frequency of such low-pressure events was not available
in the literature and is first reported herein for two values
of ReŒª , namely 150 and 418. The main result consists of
the average frequency Œ∂(p‚àí , d) with which a Lagrangian
particle undergoes a fluctuation that takes its pressure
below some threshold p‚àí for a time longer than some
minimum duration d. This average frequency, for any d,
is observed to have an exponential tail (i.e., to behave
as ‚àº C exp(Œ≤p‚àí )) towards very low pressure thresholds.
Furthermore, the value of the logarithmic slope Œ≤ that
corresponds to d ' 0 is roughly coincident with that of
the exponential tail of the pressure PDF. The PDF of
the duration of the low-pressure events is also reported,
which shows that the most probable duration is smaller

FIG. 12. Pressure isosurfaces of value p = ‚àí2, -4, -6, -8 and -10 during a burst of very-low-pressure events. The corresponding
times are, from left to right and top to bottom, t = 3.8, 6.4, 9.1, 11.8, 14.4 and 25.1. The size of the periodic box is 55.6 and
the integral scale is 12.1.

than the Kolmogorov timescale and quite insensitive to
p‚àí for both ReŒª considered. On the other hand, the mean
and median duration of the pressure excursions grow significantly with ReŒª and depend strongly on p‚àí , but only
for moderate values of this variable. The analysis of
the interarrival times between low-pressure events shows
that their occurrence departs from that of a totally random homogeneous stochastic process (Poisson process).
This departure becomes more and more accentuated as
the threshold p‚àí is lowered. The distribution of interarrival times is heavy-tailed, indicative of a bursty process.
In fact, a quantitative indicator of burstiness was computed, yielding values indicative of a highly intermittent
process. This suggests that the bursts of low-pressure
events are associated with intermittent large-scale vortical structures24 , as confirmed by examination of the
pressure isosurfaces at the time of the bursts.
The reported results provide useful quantitative data
to predict the frequency, intensity and duration of pressure fluctuations experienced by very small particles that
are passively transported by a turbulent flow. They can

be used, for example, to inform modern models of numerical cavitation25‚Äì27 . The behavior at higher Reynolds
numbers and in other turbulent flows should certainly
be explored to gain further understanding. Also, the
relative velocity that develops between non-neutrallybuoyant particles of finite size and the surrounding liquid
could attract bubbles toward vortex cores and strongly
affect the computed frequencies. These issues are the
subject of ongoing work.
