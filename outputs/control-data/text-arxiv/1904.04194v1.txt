Abstract. Let R be a regular local ring with maximal ideal m. We consider
elements f ∈ R such that their Newton polyhedron has a loose edge. We show
that if the symbolic restriction of f to such an edge is a product of two coprime
polynomials, then f factorizes in the m-adic completion.

1. Introduction
Notation. We denote by R≥0 (respectively R>0 ) the set of nonnegative (respectively positive) real numbers. The symbol h·, ·i denotes the standard scalar product.

We use a multi-index notation xα := xα
1 · · · xn for α = (α1 , . . . , αn ). The ring
of formal power series of variables x1 ,. . . , xn with coefficients in a field K will be
−1
denoted by K[[x1 , . . . , xn ]]. By K[x± ] we mean the ring K[x1 , x−1
1 , . . . , xn , xn ].
Let R be a regular local ring with maximal ideal m and residue field K = R/m.
b be its m-adic completion. (Recall that R
b = R if R is complete). For example,
Let R
this is the case R = K[[x1 , . . . , xn ]]. The main results of the article are factorization
theorems for elements in R, resp. for polynomials with coefficients in R, using
convex geometry.
Let (x) = (x1 , . . . , xn ) be a regular system of parameters for R. As shown in [3,
Proposition 2.1] (applied for J = {1, . . . , n}), since R is Noetherian and the map
b is faithfully flat, every element f ∈ R can be expanded as a finite sum

Let f = α∈Zn aα xα ∈ R be a nonzero element in R. We define the Newton

∆ ⊂ R≥0 is called a Newton polyhedron if ∆ = ∆(f ) for some nonzero f ∈ R.
Given a Newton polyhedron ∆ ⊂ Rn≥0 , for any ξ ∈ Rn≥0 we call the set
∆ξ := { a ∈ ∆ : hξ, ai = minhξ, bi }

a face of ∆. A Newton polyhedron has a finite number of faces since it is defined
by a finite set of exponents. A face ∆ξ is compact if and only if ξ ∈ Rn>0 . A face
of dimension 0 (respectively 1) is called a vertex (respectively an edge). Following
[9, p. 123], we call a compact edge of a Newton polyhedron a loose edge if it is not
contained in any compact face of dimension ≥ 2.

Several Newton polyhedra are drawn in the pictures that follow. The segments
marked in blue are loose edges.

Fig. 3

The Newton polyhedron in Figure 1 does not have any loose edge. This is the
typical situation. The Newton polyhedron in Figure 2 has a loose edge with the
end point at (0, 0, d). Weierstrass polynomials f ∈ K[[x1 , . . . , xn ]][z] such that ∆(f )
is of this type were studied in [1], [10], and [11].
In Figure 3 all compact edges are loose. A Newton polyhedron with this property
is called in [5] a polygonal Newton polyhedron. Notice that the term polygonal
Newton polyhedron can be a bit misleading since the union of compact edges in
Figure 3 is not homeomomorphic to any polygon.
Every compact edge of a plane Newton polyhedron is loose as illustrated in
Figure 4.

aα xα ∈ R. The symbolic restriction of f to a compact

face A := ∆ξ ⊂ ∆(f ), for some ξ ∈ Rn>0 , is defined as the polynomial
X
f |A =
aα X α ∈ K[X1 , . . . , Xn ],
α∈A

where aα ∈ K is the image of aα in the residue field of R. The element f |A is a
polynomial since A being a compact face implies that A∩Zn≥0 is finite. In section 3,
we provide a connection to a certain graded ring which explains the use of capital
letters (X1 , . . . , Xn ).
Below are the main results of the paper.
Theorem 1.1. Let R be a regular local ring and let f ∈ R be a nonzero element
in R. Assume that the Newton polyhedron ∆(f ) has a loose edge E. If f |E is a
product of two relatively prime polynomials G and H, where G is not divided by
b in the completion of R such that f = gh in
any variable, then there exist g, h ∈ R
b
R and g|E1 = G, h|E2 = H for some E1 , E2 such that E is the Minkowski sum of
E1 and E2 , E = E1 + E2 .

In the above theorem E1 is a loose edge of ∆(g) parallel to E and E2 is a compact
face of ∆(h) which is a loose edge parallel to E or a vertex if H is a monomial.
Remark 1.2. The assumption of Theorem 1.1 that G is not divisible by any variable
cannot be omitted. Consider the power series f = (x23 + x1 x2 )(x3 + x1 x2 ). Its
Newton polyhedron has a loose edge E with endpoints (1, 1, 1), (2, 2, 0) and f |E =
x1 x2 (x3 +x1 x2 ). The irreducible factors of f are f1 = x23 +x1 x2 and f2 = x3 +x1 x2 .
Hence f cannot be a product of power series g, h such that g|E1 = x2 (x3 + x1 x2 )
and h|E2 = x1 .
Corollary 1.3. Assume that the Newton polyhedron of f ∈ R has a loose edge and
b
at least three vertices. Then f is not irreducible in the completion R.

Corollary 1.4. Assume that the Newton polyhedron of f ∈ R has a loose edge E.
b then E is the only compact edge of ∆(f ) and f |E = cF k ,
If f is irreducible in R,
×
where c ∈ K and F ∈ K[X1 , . . . , Xn ] is an irreducible polynomial (with notations
as before). Moreover, if the residue field K of R is algebraically closed, then there
exist a, b ∈ K, k ∈ Z≥0 , α, β ∈ Zn≥0 such that f |E = (aX α + bX β )k with a primitive
lattice vector α − β.

We will say that a segment E ⊂ Rn+1 is descendant if E is parallel to some
vector c = (c1 , . . . , cn , cn+1 ) such that ci ≥ 0 for i = 1, . . . , n and cn+1 < 0.
Theorem 1.5. Let R be a regular local ring and let f ∈ R[y] be a polynomial
with coefficients in R, for some independent variable y. Assume that the Newton
polyhedron ∆(f ) ⊂ Rn+1
≥0 has a loose and descendant edge E. If f |E is a product of
two relatively prime polynomials G, H ∈ K[X1 , . . . , Xn ][y], where G is monic with
b such that f = gh, g is a monic polynomial
respect to y, then there exist g, h ∈ R[y]
with respect to y and g|E1 = G, h|E2 = H for some E1 , E2 such that E = E1 + E2 .
Moreover, if R = K[[x1 , . . . , xn ]], then g and h are uniquely determined.
2. Proofs if R = K[[x1 , . . . , xn ]]
At the beginning of this section we establish some results about loose edges.
Lemma 2.1. Let ∆ be a Newton polyhedron with a loose edge E that has ends a,
b ∈ Rn≥0 . Then for every c ∈ ∆ and every ξ ∈ Rn≥0 such that hξ, ai = hξ, bi one has
hξ, ci ≥ hξ, ai.
Proof. Let V be the set of vertices of ∆. If V = {a, b} then Lemma 2.1 follows
easily since every point of ∆ can be written as λa + µb + z for some z ∈ Rn≥0
and λ, µ ≥ 0 such that λ + µ = 1. Hence in the rest of the proof assume that there
exists a vertex of ∆ different from a or b and consider the function
ψ(ξ) =

min

hξ, vi − hξ, ai,

v∈V \{a,b}

ξ ∈ Rn≥0 .

Since the set of vertices is finite, this function is well defined and continuous.
Since E is a compact face of ∆, there exists ξ0 ∈ Rn>0 such that hξ0 , ai = hξ0 , bi
and hξ0 , ci > hξ0 , ai for all c ∈ ∆ \ E. This yields
ψ(ξ0 ) > 0.
Suppose that there exist c ∈ ∆ and ξ1 ∈ Rn≥0 such that hξ1 , ci < hξ1 , ai = hξ1 , bi.
Observe that c = λ1 v1 + · · · + λs vs + z, for some z ∈ Rn≥0 , v1 , . . . , vs ∈ V and

4

JANUSZ GWOŹDZIEWICZ, BEATA HEJMEJ, AND BERND SCHOBER

λi ≥ 0 such that λ1 + · · · + λs = 1. If hξ1 , vi ≥ hξ1 , ai for every vertex v of ∆, then
hξ1 , ci = λ1 hξ1 , v1 i + · · · + λs hξ1 , vs i + hξ1 , zi ≥ (λ1 + · · · + λs )hξ1 , ai = hξ1 , ai, which
contradicts the assumption hξ1 , ci < hξ1 , ai. Hence hξ1 , vi < hξ1 , ai for at least one
vertex v ∈ V . Thus
ψ(ξ1 ) < 0.
It follows from the above that there exist ξ in the segment, joining ξ0 and ξ1 , such
that ψ(ξ) = 0. It means that there exists v ∈ V \ {a, b} such that hξ, vi = hξ, ai =
hξ, bi ≤ hξ, di for all d ∈ ∆. This implies that ∆ξ is a compact (since ξ ∈ Rn>0 ) face
of dimension ≥ 2, which contains E. Therefore, we obtained a contradiction to the
hypothesis that E is a loose edge.

Lemma 2.2. Let ∆ be a Newton polyhedron with a loose edge E that has end points
a = (a1 , . . . , an ), b = (b1 , . . . , bn ). If min(a1 , b1 ) = · · · = min(an , bn ) = 0, then a
and b are the only vertices of ∆.
Proof. By assumption there exist two nonempty and disjoint subsets A, B of the
set of indices {1, . . . , n} such that ai > 0 for i ∈ A, ai = 0 for i ∈ {1, . . . , n} \ A,
bj > 0 for j ∈ B and bj = 0 for j ∈ {1, . . . , n} \ B.
Let c = (c1 , . . . , cn ) be an arbitrary point of ∆ different from a and b. For any
i ∈ A, j ∈ B consider the vector ξij , which has only two nonzero entries: 1/ai at
place i and 1/bj at place j (i 6= j since A ∩ B = ∅). Then hξij , ai = hξij , bi = 1 and
hξij , ci = ci /ai + cj /bj . By Lemma 2.1 we get ci /ai + cj /bj ≥ 1. It follows that
min ci /ai + min cj /bj ≥ 1.
i∈A

j∈B

Choose constants λ ≥ 0, µ ≥ 0 such that λ ≤ mini∈A ci /ai , µ ≤ minj∈B cj /bj
and λ + µ = 1. Then c = λa + µb + z for some z ∈ Rn≥0 , hence c cannot be a vertex
of ∆.

Lemma 2.3. Let c ∈ Zn be a point with at least one positive and at least one
negative coordinate. Then there exists a basis ξ1 ,. . . , ξn of the vector space Rn
such that ξi ∈ Zn≥0 for i = 1, . . . , n and hξi , ci = 0 for i = 1, . . . , n − 1.
Proof. For any basis ξ1 , . . . , ξn of Rn set w = (w1 , . . . , wn ) := (hξ1 , ci, . . . , hξn , ci).
By the hypothesis of the lemma, for the standard basis ξ1 = (1, 0, . . . , 0), . . . ,
ξn = (0, . . . , 0, 1) of Rn there exist i, j ∈ {1, . . . , n} such that wi , wj have opposite
signs. We will gradually modify the standard basis until we reach a basis such that
only one coordinate of w is nonzero. Below we outline the algorithm.
1. If there are only two nonzero entries wj , wk of w and wj + wk = 0, then
replace ξk by ξk + ξj and stop.
2. If there are two nonzero entries wj , wk of w of opposite signs such that
|wj | < |wk |, then replace ξk by ξk + ξj and go to step 1, otherwise go to
step 3.
3. Choose three nonzero entries wj , wk , wl of w such that wk = wl = −wj
(such a choice is possible since in this step all nonzero entries of w have the
same absolute value), replace ξk by ξk + ξj and go to step 1.
After P
every loop of the above algorithm wk is replaced by wk + wj . Hence the
n
number i=1 |wi | decreases and the algorithm must terminate.

We encourage the reader to apply the algorithm from the proof in a simple case,
for example for c = (2, 3, −4).

From now on up to the end of this section we fix a loose edge E. Let c be a
primitive lattice vector parallel to E. Applying Lemma 2.3 to c we find n − 1 linearly independent vectors ξ1 ,. . . , ξn−1 ∈ Zn≥0 which are orthogonal to E. For
every monomial xα we set ω(xα ) := (hξ1 , αi, . . . , hξn−1 , αi). We call this vector
ω(xβ ) for any monomials xα , xβ , the
a weight of xα . Since ω(xα xβ ) = ω(xα ) +L
ring K[x1 , . . . , xn ] turns into a graded ring w∈Zn−1 Rw , where Rw is spanned by
≥0
monomials of weight w. We have that R(0) = K. Indeed, if xα ∈ R(0) for some
α 6= 0 and β is a point of E, then the points β + tα, for t > 0, belong to E, hence
E is unbounded.
All monomials of Rw are of the form xa+ic where xa is a fixed monomial of Rw
and i is an integer. This shows that Rw is a finite-dimensional vector space over K
since there is only a finite number of integers i such that all coordinates of a+ ic are
nonnegative. We denote by dim Rw the dimension of Rw as a vector space over K. It
1 α2
may happen that dim Rw = 0. Take for example the weight ω(xα
1 x2 ) = 3α1 +2α2 .
Then there is no monomial of weight 1, hence R1 ⊂ K[x1 , x2 ] is a zero-dimensional
vector space.
n−1
Let M ⊂ Z≥0
be the set of weights satisfying the condition: z ∈ M if and only
if there exists xα ∈ K[x± ] such that ω(xα ) = z and hξ, αi ≥ 0 for all ξ ∈ Rn≥0 which
are orthogonal to E. Observe that M is closed under addition. Moreover for any
n−1
w ∈ Z≥0
such that dim Rw > 0 we have w ∈ M .
n−1
Lemma 2.4. Let w ∈ Z≥0
and z ∈ M . Assume that Rw contains two coprime
monomials. Then

dim Rw+z = dim Rw + dim Rz − 1.

n−1
Proof. For any v ∈ Z≥0
the dimension of the vector space Rv is equal to the
number of monomials xα such that ω(xα ) = v, hence is equal to the number of
lattice points, i.e. all points with integer coordinates, in the set

lv = { α ∈ Rn≥0 : (hξ1 , αi, . . . , hξn−1 , αi) = v }.
Notice that lv is the intersection of the straight line {a + tc : t ∈ R} with Rn≥0 ,
where ω(xa ) = v and c is a primitive lattice vector parallel to the edge E.
By the assumption, Rw contains two coprime monomials xa and xb . Hence
min(a1 , b1 ) = · · · = min(an , bn ) = 0 which yields the partition of {1, . . . , n} to three
sets A = {i ∈ {1, . . . , n} : ai = 0, bi > 0}, B = {i ∈ {1, . . . , n} : ai > 0, bi = 0} and
C = {i ∈ {1, . . . , n} : ai = 0, bi = 0}. Since A and B are nonempty, a and b are
the endpoints of the segment lw . We may assume without loss of generality that
the vector c is pointed in the direction of b − a. If dim Rw = r + 1, then the lattice
points of lw are a, a + c, . . . , b = a + rc.
If the lattice points of lz are d, d + c, . . . , d + sc then a + d, a + d + c, . . . ,
a + d + (r + s)c are the lattice points of lw+z (see Figure 5). It is easy to check
that the points a + d − c and a + d + (r + s + 1)c do not belong to Rn≥0 . Hence
dim Rw+z = r + s. This ends the proof in the case dim Rz > 0.

Now suppose that dim Rz = 0. Let xd ∈ K[x± ] be any monomial with integer
exponents such that ω(xd ) = z. Replacing this monomial by xd+kc , for suitably
chosen integer k, we may assume that di0 < 0 for some i0 ∈ A and di + ci ≥ 0 for
all i ∈ A.
Take the vector vj = c1i ei0 − c1j ej , where e1 , . . . , en is the standard basis of
0
Rn and j ∈ B. Then vj ∈ Rn≥0 is orthogonal to E. By the assumption that
z ∈ M (use ξ = vj and α = d in the definition of M ) we get the inequality
di0 /ci0 − dj /cj = hvj , di ≥ 0. Hence dj > 0 for all j ∈ B, since, by the definitions
of A, B and the convention that c points into the direction of b − a, we have cj < 0
for j ∈ B and ci0 > 0 for i0 ∈ A, and since di0 < 0, by assumption.
If j ∈ C then ej is orthogonal to E. By the assumption that z ∈ M (use ξ = ej
and α = d in the definition of M ) we get the inequality dj ≥ 0 for all j ∈ C.
Notice that dj + cj < 0 for at least one j ∈ B, otherwise all exponents of xd+c
would be nonnegative, which would contradict dim Rz = 0.
The lattice points of lw+z are of the form a + d + ic, where i ∈ Z. Since di0 < 0,
the point a+d has a negative coordinate. Since dj +cj < 0 for some j ∈ B, the point
a + d + (r + 1)c = b + d + c has a negative coordinate. We claim that all coordinates
of the points a + d + ic are nonnegative, for i = 1, . . . , r: If j ∈ A, then we have seen
that dj + cj ≥ 0 and cj > 0, and hence, aj + dj + icj = aj + (cj + dj ) + (i − 1)cj ≥ 0,
for i ≥ 1. On the other hand, if j ∈ C then aj = bj = 0, thus cj = 0, and we
have seen that dj ≥ 0. This provides aj + dj + icj = dj ≥ 0, for j ∈ C. Finally,
for j ∈ B, we have dj > 0 and bj = 0, and since c = (b − a)/r, we have that

aj + dj + icj = aj + dj − iaj /r = (1 − i/r)aj + dj > 0, for i = 1, . . . , r. This proves
the claim. Hence dim Rz+w = r which finishes the proof.

In the appendix, we outline an alternative proof for Lemma 2.4.
Lemma 2.5. Let G ∈ Rw and H ∈ Rz be coprime polynomials. If G is not divisible
by any monomial then for every i ∈ M
GRz+i + HRw+i = Rw+z+i .
Proof. Consider the following sequence
Φ

Ψ

0 −→ Ri −→ Rz+i × Rw+i −→ Rw+z+i ,
where Φ : η 7→ (ηH, −ηG) and Ψ : (ψ, ϕ) 7→ ψG + ϕH. Take any (ψ, ϕ) ∈ Rz+i ×
Rw+i such that Ψ(ψ, ϕ) = ψG + ϕH = 0. Since G and H are coprime, there exists
η ∈ Ri such that ψ = ηH and ϕ = −ηG. Thus ker Ψ ⊂ im Φ. The opposite
inclusion is obvious. Moreover, it is easy to see that Φ is injective. It follows that
the above sequence is exact.
By assumption G ∈ Rw ⊂ K[x1 , . . . , xn ] is neither a constant nor a monomial.
Hence there appear at least two monomials in G with non-zero coefficient and
they can be chosen to be coprime as G is not divisible by a monomial. Since
both monomials are contained in Rw , we obtain that Rw satisfies the hypothesis of
Lemma 2.4. Hence we get dim Im Ψ = dim Rz+i + dim Rw+i − dim Ri = dim Rz+i +
(dim Rw + dim Ri − 1) − dim Ri = dim Rw + dim Rz+i − 1 = dim Rw+z+i , which
implies that Ψ is surjective.

Since all monomials of f |E have the same weight, the polynomial f |E is homogeneous in a graded ring K[x1 , . . . , xn ]. Then by an elementary property of
graded rings the equality f |E = GH implies that G ∈ Rw and H ∈ Rz for some
n−1
w, z ∈ Z≥0
. Let xα be any monomial which appears with nonzero coefficient
in the power series f and xα0 be a fixed monomial of f |E . By Lemma 2.1 we
have hξ, αi ≥ hξ, α0 i for every ξ ∈ Rn≥0 which is orthogonal to E. This yields
ω(xα−α0 ) ∈PM . Since ω(xα0 ) = w + z, we get xα ∈ Rw+z+i for some i ∈ M and
hence f = i∈M fw+z+i , where fw+z+i ∈ Rw+z+i .
Let gw := G and hz := H. Then fw+z = gw hz . Let us set M in degreelexicographic order. Using Lemma 2.5 we can find recursively gw+i ∈ Rw+i and
hz+i ∈ Rz+i such that
gw hz+i + hz gw+i = fw+z+i − Fi ,
where
Fi =

Lemma 2.3. Then for E1 := ∆(g)ξ and E2 := ∆(h)ξ we have g|E1 = gw , h|E2 = hz
and E = E1 + E2 .

Proof of Corollary 1.3. Assume that a = (a1 , . . . , an ), b = (b1 , . . . , bn ) are the ends
of a loose edge E of the Newton polyhedron ∆(f ). Since ∆(f ) has at least three
vertices, Lemma 2.2 implies that c = (min(a1 , b1 ), . . . , min(an , bn )) has at least
one nonzero coordinate. The monomials xa and xb appear in the polynomial f |E
with nonzero coefficients and their greatest common divisor equals xc . Thus G :=
x−c · f |E is not divisible by any variable, so G and H := xc are relatively prime.
Using Theorem 1.1 we obtain that f is not irreducible.

Lemma 2.6. Let G ∈ Rw and Hj ∈ Rzj for j = 1, 2. Assume that for every i ∈ M

GRz1 +z2 +i + H1 H2 Rw+i = Rw+z1 +z2 +i .

E and w ∈ M , we have 0 ≤ hvi , β −αi = βi −αi for i = 1, . . . , n. Thus ψ/H = xβ−α
is a monomial with nonnegative exponents.
Lemma 2.7. Let G ∈ Rw and H ∈ Rz be coprime polynomials. If G is monic with
respect to y, then for every i ∈ M
(1)

GRz+i + HRw+i = Rw+z+i .

Proof. First, we prove (1) in the special case G = y and H ∈ Rz′ .
Every F ∈ Rw+z+i can be written in the form F = yφ + ψ where φ, ψ are
polynomials and ψ does not depend on y. Then φ ∈ Rz+i and ψ = Hψ ′ where

ψ ′ = ψ/H ∈ Rw+i
. This gives (1) in the special case. All remaining cases follow
from Lemma 2.5 and Lemma 2.6.

Proceeding as in the proof of Theorem 1.1, but using Lemma 2.7 instead of
Lemma 2.5 we obtain g, h ∈ K[[x, y]] such that f = gh, g|E1 = G and h|E2 = H
for some segments E1 , E2 , where E = E1 + E2 . The assumptions that the loose

edge E is descendant and the polynomial G is monic with respect to y imply that
the Newton polyhedron of g has a vertex (0, . . . , 0, d) for some positive integer d.
Therefore g(0, . . . , 0, y) = vy d for some v ∈ K[[y]] such that v(0) 6= 0. It means that
g fulfills the assumptions of the Weierstrass Preparation Theorem, which implies
that g = uĝ, where u is a power series such that u(0) 6= 0 and ĝ ∈ K[[x1 , . . . , xn ]][y]
is a Weierstrass polynomial of degree d. Putting g = ĝ and h = uh we get f = gh.
Since we can also obtain h using the polynomial division of f by g in the ring
K[[x1 , . . . , xn ]][y], we conclude that h is a polynomial with respect to y.

3. Extending to regular local rings
After discussing the case of a formal power series ring over a field K, we explain
how the results can be extended to the completion of a regular local ring by using
graded rings.
Let (R, m, K = R/m) be a regular local ring, let (x) = (x1 , . . . , xn ) be a regular
b be the m-adic completion of R. We consider f ∈ R
system of parameters, and let R
such that its Newton polyhedron has a loose edge E.
First, let us point out that Lemmas 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 are results on convex geometry.
In fact, they are true for any F -subset ∆ ⊂ Rn≥0 , which is closed convex subset
such that ∆ + Rn≥0 = ∆, [7, p. 260]. In particular, they are independent of R.
Furthermore, the proof of Corollary 1.3 only uses Theorem 1.1 and Lemma 2.2 and
thus can be applied word by word.
Observation 3.1. Recall that, after Lemma 2.3, we introduced a weight given
by ω(xα ) := (hξ1 , αi, . . . , hξn−1 , αi), where ξ1 ,. . . , ξn−1 ∈ Zn≥0 are linearly independent vectors which are orthogonal to E. The map ω induces a monomial
n−1
valuation (denoted also by ω) on R with values in Z≥0
, i.e. for any nonzero
P
α
×
h = α∈Zn bα x ∈ R, where bα ∈ R ∪ {0}, we set
≥0

ω(h) := inf{ω(xα ) : bα 6= 0}.
n−1
We equip Z≥0
with the partial ordering defined by α ≤ β ⇔ β = α + γ, for
n−1
some γ ∈ Z≥0 . The graded ring of R associated to ω is defined as
M
grω (R) :=
Pw /Pw+ ,
w∈Zn−1
≥0

where Pw := {h ∈ R : ω(h) ≥ w} and Pw+ := {h ∈ R : ω(h) > w}. Note that
+
P(0) = R and P(0)
= m, since ω(xi ) > (0) for all i = 1, . . . , n. Hence, we have
+
P(0) /P(0) = K. Denote by Xi ∈ grω (R) the image of xi ∈ R in the graded ring.
Then the initial form of h
Pwith respect to ω is defined by inω (h) := Xi if h = xi
and otherwise, inω (h) := α:ω(xα )=ω(h) bα X α , where bα ∈ K is the image of bα in
the residue field. Since ωL
is a monomial valuation, we have Pw /Pw+ = Rw , for all
n−1
w ∈ Z≥0 , i.e., grω (R) = w∈Zn−1 Rw ∼
= K[X1 , . . . , Xn ].
≥0
In conclusion, we see that the second set of ingredients for the proofs of Theorems
1.1 and 1.5, Lemmas 2.4 and 2.5, are results on the graded ring grω (R) without the
restriction R = K[[x]].

The essential part for extending the proof to any regular local ring, is the following construction to find a lift g ∈ R for a given homogeneous element G ∈
n−1
: We can write G as a finite sum
Rw ⊂ grω (R) ∼
= K[X1 , . . . , Xn ], where w ∈ Z≥0
P
α
G = α∈Zn λα X , for λα ∈ K. For every α ∈ Zn≥0 with λα 6= 0, we choose a unit
≥0

bα ∈ R× such that we have bα ≡ λα mod m. Otherwise, we put bα := 0 ∈ R. We
define
X
g :=
bα xα ∈ R,
α∈Zn
≥0

which is an element in R since all but finitely many coefficients bα are zero. By
construction, the image of g in grω (R) is G, i.e., inω (g) = G.
In general, g is not unique since it depends on a choice of a system of representatives in R for the residue field K = R/m. If K ⊂ R, then we can uniquely choose
bα := λα .
Using the above, we can adapt the proofs to obtain Theorems 1.1 and 1.5.
Proof of Theorem 1.1. Let w0 := ω(f ). We have f |E = inω (f ). By the hypothesis
of the theorem, inω (f ) = GH ∈ Rw0 . Since all monomials of inω (f ) have the same
n−1
weight, it follows G ∈ Rw and H ∈ Rz for some w, z ∈ Z≥0
such that w + z = w0 .
We set Gw P
:= G and Hz := H.
Let f = α aα xα be a finite expansion of f in R. Fix α0 ∈ Zn≥0 such that aα0 6= 0
and ω(xα0 ) = w0 , i.e., X α0 is a monomial appearing in inω (f ). By Lemma 2.1,
we have hξ, αi ≥ hξ, α0 i for every ξ ∈ Rn≥0 which is orthogonal to E. This yields
ω(xα−α0 ) ∈ M . Since ω(xα0 ) = w + z, we obtain ω(xα ) = w + z + i = w0 + i, for
some i ∈ M .
We choose a lift gw ∈ R (resp. hz ∈ R) of Gw ∈ Rw (resp. Hz ∈ Rz ), as described
before. We define our first approximation of f as φ1 := gw · hz . Note that inω (f ) =
inω (φ1 ). We introduce f1 := f −φ1 . By the previous, we have w1 := ω(f1 ) = w0 +i1 ,
for some i1 ∈ M and i1 6= (0). In particular, inω (f1 ) ∈ Rw+z+i1 ⊂ grω (R). By
assumption, Gw = G is not divisible by a monomial, hence, by Lemma 2.5, there
are Hz+i1 ∈ Rz+i1 and Gw+i1 ∈ Rw+i1 such that inω (f1 ) = Gw Hz+i1 + Hz Gw+i1 .
We choose hz+i1 , gw+i1 ∈ R, as described before. The second approximation φ2 ∈ R
of f is then defined as
φ2 := (gw + gw+i1 )(hz + hz+i1 ) = gw hz + (gw hz+i1 + hz gw+i1 ) + gw+i1 hz+i1 .
that w2 :=
By construction, ω(gw+i1 hz+i1 ) > w1 . For f2 := f − φ2 , we obtain P
ω(f2 ) > w1 . We proceed with the construction and finally get g := i∈M gw+i ,
P
b with the property f = g · h in R.
b
h := i∈M hz+i ∈ R
The claim concerning E = E1 + E2 follows with the same argument as in the
case R = K[[x]].

Finally, the proof of Theorem 1.5 for R = K[[x]] can easily be adapted to the
general setting:
Proof of Theorem 1.5. Proceeding as in the previous proof, but using Lemma 2.7
b
instead of Lemma 2.5 we obtain g, h ∈ R[[y]]
such that f = gh, g|E1 = G and
h|E2 = H for some segments E1 , E2 , where E = E1 + E2 . The assumptions that
the loose edge E is descendant and the polynomial G is monic with respect to y
imply that the Newton polyhedron of g has a vertex (0, . . . , 0, d) for some positive
integer d. Hence, the monomial vy d appears in an expansion of g, for some unit

4. Examples
Let us discuss some examples.
Example 4.1. Let R be a regular local ring (not necessarily complete) of dimension
three with regular system of parameters (x, y, z) and residue field K. Suppose that
R contains a field of characteristic different from two. (E.g., R = K[x, y, z]hx,y,zi
and char(K) 6= 2). Consider the element
f = x6 y 2 − z 4 + xyz 4 − x7 y 5 z 2 ∈ R.
It is not hard to see that the Newton polyhedron ∆(f ) has exactly two vertices,
v1 = (6, 2, 0) and v2 = (0, 0, 4). Hence, v1 and v2 determine a loose edge E of ∆(f ).
The symbolic restriction of f to E is
f |E = X 6 Y 2 − Z 4 = (X 3 Y − Z 2 )(X 3 Y + Z 2 ) ∈ K[X, Y, Z] ∼
= grω (R),
where ω = ω(ξ), for ξ ∈ R3≥0 appropriately chosen such that ∆(f )ξ = E. (Here,
and in the examples below, we leave the explicit computation of ξ and ω as an
exercise to the reader).
b in the
By Theorem 1.1, the factorization of f |E implies that there are g, h ∈ R
completion such that f = gh. Indeed, if we have a closer look at f , we observe that
f = x6 y 2 (1 − xy 3 z 2 ) − z 4 (1 − xy), which factors in the completion as
p
p
p
p
b
f = (x3 y 1 − xy 3 z 2 − z 2 1 − xy)(x3 y 1 − xy 3 z 2 + z 2 1 − xy) ∈ R.
Example 4.2. Let R be any regular local ring of dimension three with regular
system of parameters (x, y, z) and residue field K. Let
f = xyz + x3 y 3 + x3 z 3 + y 3 z 3 .
We observe that the Newton polyhedron is of the form as the one in Figure 3 at
the beginning. In particular, it has three loose edges. If we consider the edge
E determined by the vertices (1, 1, 1) and (3, 3, 0), we see that the corresponding
symbolic restriction is f |E = XY Z + X 3 Y 3 = XY (Z + X 2 Y 2 ) ∈ K[X, Y, Z].
b by Theorem 1.1.
Therefore, f is not irreducible in the completion R,
Note that in the previous example, R is allowed to have mixed characteristics,
e.g., we might have R = Z[y, z]hp,y,zi , where x = p ∈ Z is a prime number.
Example 4.3. Let R be a regular local ring of dimension two with regular system
of parameters (x1 , x2 ) and residue field K. Consider the Weierstrass polynomial
18
f = y 8 + (x31 − x22 )y 3 + x51 x42 y 2 − x15
1 x2 ∈ R[y].

In Figure 6 the corresponding Newton polyhedron is drawn.

Fig. 6
The edge E determined by the vertices (5, 4, 2) and (15, 18, 0) is loose and descendant. Since the symbolic restriction of f to E is
f |E = X15 X24 Y 2 − X115 X218 = X15 X24 (Y − X15 X27 )(Y + X15 X27 ) ∈ K[X1 , X2 , Y ],
b
Theorem 1.5 implies that f is not irreducible in R[y].
Example 4.4. Let R = Zp be the p-adic integers, for some p ∈ Z prime. Let
f = y 3 + 270y + 540 ∈ R[y].
Note that 270 = 2 · 33 · 5 and 540 = 22 · 33 · 5 and the residue field of R is Fp .
(1) If p = 2, then f = y 3 + ǫ1 py + ǫ3 p2 , for ǫ1 , ǫ3 ∈ Z×
2 units. The Newton
polyhedron has three vertices (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 0). If E2 denotes the edge
given by (0, 3) and (1, 1), then f |E2 = Y 3 + P Y = Y (Y 2 + P ) ∈ F2 [P, Y ].
c2 [y].
Hence, Theorem 1.5 implies that f factors in Z

(2) If p = 3, then f = y 3 + µ1 p3 y + µ3 p3 , for µ1 , µ3 ∈ Z×
3 units. The Newton
polyhedron has two vertices (0, 3) and (3, 0). Let E3 be the corresponding
compact edge. We have f |E3 = Y 3 + P 3 = (Y + P )3 ∈ F3 [P, Y ]. Therefore,
we cannot apply Theorem 1.5.
Note that if p = 5, then f = y 3 + ρ1 py + ρ3 p, for ρ1 , ρ3 ∈ Z×
5 units, which means
c
that f ∈ Z5 [y] is irreducible in Z5 [y].
5. Relation with known results
Corollary 1.4 generalizes to n > 2 variables the following well-known fact.
Theorem 5.1 ([6, Lemma 3.15]). Assume that a power series f ∈ C[[x, y]] written
as a sum of homogeneous polynomials f = fd + fd+1 + . . . , where the subindex
means the degree, is irreducible. Then fd is a power of a linear form.
Let K be a field and fix a weight ω(xi y j ) := ni + mj for n, m ∈ Z>0 . Given
0 6= F ∈ K[[x, y]], we will consider its decomposition in ω-quasihomogeneous forms
F (x, y) = Fa+b (x, y) + Fa+b+1 (x, y) + . . . ,
where the subindex means the ω-weight.

13

Theorem 5.2 ([2, Lemma A1]). Assume that Fa+b (x, y) = fa (x, y)gb (x, y), where
fa , gb ∈ K[x, y] are quasihomogeneous and coprime. Then, there exist
f, g ∈ K[[x, y]],

f = fa + fa+1 + . . . ,

g = gb + gb+1 + . . .

such that F = f g. Moreover if fa is an irreducible polynomial, then f is an irreducible power series.
Theorem 1.1 was inspired by the method of the proof of Theorem 5.2.
Corollary 1.4 generalizes the following result of [4].
Theorem 5.3. If φ ∈ C{x1 , . . . , xn } is irreducible and has a polygonal Newton
polyhedron ∆(φ), then the polyhedron ∆(φ) has only one compact edge E and the
polynomial φ|E is a power of an irreducible polynomial.
We recall that a Newton polyhedron is called polygonal if all its compact edges
are loose.
Theorem 1.5 generalizes the main result of [11] quoted below. For this, let us
recall that a monic Weierstrass polynomial P (Z) ∈ k[[x1 , . . . , xn ]][Z] of degree d
has an orthant associated polyhedron if the projection of its Newton polyhedron
from the distinguished point (0, . . . , 0, d) ∈ Rn+1
≥0 to the subspace corresponding to
(x1 , . . . , xn ) is a polyhedron with exactly one vertex ([11, Definiton 2.2]).
Theorem 5.4. Let P (Z) ∈ k[[x1 , . . . , xn ]][Z] be a monic Weierstrass polynomial.
Assume that P(Z) has an orthant associated polyhedron and that P |Γ ∈ k[x1 , . . . , xn , Z]
is the product of two coprime monic polynomials S1 , S2 ∈ k[x1 , . . . , xn , Z], respectively, of degree d1 and d2 . Then there exist two monic polynomials P1 , P2 ∈
k[[x1 , . . . , xn ]][Z], respectively, of degrees d1 and d2 in Z such that
i) P = P1 P2 ,
ii) there is at least one i ∈ {1, 2} such that Pi has an orthant associated polyhedron
and if Γi denotes the compact face of ∆(Pi ) containing the points (0, . . . , 0, di ), then
Pi |Γi = Si and Γi is parallel to Γ.
Remark. Let f ∈ k[[x1 , . . . , xn ]][y] be a Weierstrass polynomial of degree d. Then
f has an orthant associated polyhedron if and only if ∆(f ) has a loose edge with
endpoint (0, . . . , 0, d). The reason for this is the following: ∆(f ) not having a loose
edge with endpoint (0, . . . , 0, d) is equivalent to the existence of a compact face of
dimension ≥ 2, where one of the vertices is (0, . . . , 0, d). The latter is equivalent
to the condition that the projection of the Newton polyhedron from (0, . . . , 0, d) to
the subspace determined by (x1 , . . . , xn ) has at least two vertices which correspond
to vertices of the considered compact face. We also refer to [10, Lemma 3.1].
Appendix: Alternative proof for Lemma 2.4
Recall the notations of section 2. We outline an alternative proof for
n−1
Lemma 2.4. Let w ∈ Z≥0
and z ∈ M . Assume that Rw contains two coprime
monomials. Then
dim Rw+z = dim Rw + dim Rz − 1.

14

n−1
Proof. For any v ∈ Z≥0
the dimension of the vector space Rv is equal to the
number of monomials xα such that ω(xα ) = v, hence is equal to the number of
lattice points, i.e. all points with integer coordinates, in the set

lv = { α ∈ Rn≥0 : (hξ1 , αi, . . . , hξn−1 , αi) = v }.
Notice that lv is the intersection of the straight line {a + tc : t ∈ R} with Rn≥0 ,
where ω(xa ) = v and c is a primitive lattice vector parallel to the edge E.
By the assumption, Rw contains two coprime monomials xa and xb . Hence
min(a1 , b1 ) = · · · = min(an , bn ) = 0. Thus there exist two nonempty and disjoint
subsets A, B of {1, . . . , n} such that ai > 0 ⇔ i ∈ A and bi > 0 ⇔ i ∈ B. Without
loss of generality we may assume that the vector c is pointed in the direction of
b − a. Then
lw = { a + tc : t ∈ [0, m] }

(2)
for some positive integer m.

Now we will show that the set lz is nonempty and give its description.
Let d ∈ Zn be such that ω(xd ) = z. Consider the system of inequalities
dj + tcj ≥ 0 for j ∈ B.
Its solution space is an interval [t1 , ∞).
Let a′ = d + t1 c. Then a′j ≥ 0 for all j ∈ B and a′j0 = 0 for some j0 ∈ B.
c
Consider the vectors vj = ej − cjj ej0 for j ∈ {1, . . . , n} \ B, where e1 , . . . en is
0
the standard basis of Rn . These vectors belong to Rn≥0 and are orthogonal to E.
By the assumption that z ∈ M we get a′j = hvj , a′ i ≥ 0. It follows that a′ ∈ Rn≥0 .
Using the same argument, but starting from the system of inequalities
di + tci ≥ 0

for i ∈ A

we show that there exist t2 ∈ R such that the point b′ = d + t2 c belongs to Rn≥0
and b′k = 0 for some k ∈ A.
It follows from the above that a′ , b′ ∈ lz and
(3)

lz = { d + tc : t ∈ [t1 , t2 ] }

for some rational numbers t1 < t2 .
Finally, lw+z is a segment with endpoints a + a′ , b + b′ which can be written in
the form
(4)

lw+z = { a + d + tc : t ∈ [t1 , t2 + m] }.

Using (2)–(4) and counting integer points in the segments [0, m], [t1 , t2 ], [t1 , t2 +
m] we get the lemma.
