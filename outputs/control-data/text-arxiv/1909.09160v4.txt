Abstract
The nature of dark matter (DM) and how it might interact with the particles of the Standard Model
(SM) is an ever-growing mystery. It is possible that the existence of new ‘dark sector’ forces, yet
undiscovered, are the key to solving this fundamental problem, and one might hope that in the future
such forces might even be ‘unified’ with the ones we already know in some UV-complete framework.
In this paper, following a bottom-up approach, we attempt to take the first steps in the construction
of such a framework. The much-discussed possibility of the kinetic mixing (KM) of the ‘dark photon’
with the hypercharge gauge boson of the SM via loops of portal matter (PM) fields, charged in both
sectors, offers an attractive starting point for these efforts. Given the anticipated finite strength of
the KM in a UV-complete theory, the absence of anomalies, and the lifetime constraints on the PM
fields arising from CMB and nucleosynthesis constraints, PM must behave as vector-like copies of the
known SM fermion fields, such as those which appear naturally in, e.g., E6 -type models. Within such
a setup, the SM and their corresponding partner PM fields would be related by a new SU (2)I gauge
symmetry. With this observation as a springboard, we construct a generalization of these ideas where
SU (2)I is augmented by an additional U (1)IY factor so that the light dark photon is the result of a
symmetry breaking analogous to the SM, i.e., SU (2)I × U (1)IY → U (1)D , but with U (1)D now also
broken at the <
∼ GeV scale. While SM fields are U (1)D singlets, as in the conventional dark photon
approach, they transform nontrivially under the full SU (2)I × U (1)IY gauge group. This approach
leads to numerous interesting signatures, both at low energies and at colliders, and can be viewed as
an initial step in the construction of a more UV-complete framework.

Introduction

The nature of dark matter (DM) is one of our biggest mysteries and points to there being new physics
beyond the Standard Model (SM). Historically, the favorite candidates for DM originated in top-down
theories which addressed other outstanding problems within the SM such as axions [1, 2] and WIMPs [3].
While so far obtaining only null results, important experimental searches for such states are on-going.
However, these as-yet null results, in addition to the realization of how large the parameter space for
potential DM candidates might be, have inspired both increased model-building activity and the everwidening scope of experimental DM searches [4, 5]. In almost all DM scenarios, new forces carried by
non-SM mediator particles are needed to pass through the SM-dark sector barricade thrown down by
nature and convey the interaction between the DM and the SM that is responsible for the DM obtaining
its observed relic density [6]. Among these, one of the most experimentally accessible and also wellstudied scenarios is that of the dark photon/vector portal model [7]. In its simplest form, one imagines
a new, broken dark U (1)D gauge group associated with a massive vector dark photon, V ; here we will
assume this symmetry is broken by a the vev of a SM singlet dark Higgs field, S, at the ∼ GeV scale.
While DM carries a non-trivial dark charge, QD , it is assumed that the SM fields do not and so are not
directly coupled to V . However, via the kinetic mixing (KM) [8] of V with the familiar SM U (1)Y weak
hypercharge gauge boson, B, after electroweak symmetry breaking the SM fields pick up a small coupling
to V proportional to their electric charge, eQem . Here  describes the strength of the KM [8] and thus
the suppression of our interactions with the dark sector is due to the small, loop-induced value of this
parameter in such scenario. While this is an extremely interesting setup, it is likely to only be an IR
shadow of a much larger and more complex UV-complete theory which may have implications beyond
just the, now potentially more intricate, dark sector.
In our earlier work [9], hereafter designated as I, we took the first step on the way to the construction
of a more UV-complete KM scenario; it is the purpose of this paper to take a further step in this direction.
The point of view taken in I is that the KM generating mechanism itself may provide the first hint to
the direction we should follow. As is well known, KM is generated by the existence of sets of fields,
here called portal matter (PM), that carry both dark charges as well as, at the very least, SM weak
hypercharge thus linking the two U (1) factors via a 1-loop vacuum polarization-like diagram. In I we
argued that in a complete UV-theory the strength of KM, , is a finite, in principle calculable, quantity
as it is in GUTs [10] with split multiplets. This hypothesis, when combined with the necessity that such
new states be unstable since they carry SM quantum numbers, led to a number of restrictions on the
nature of the possible portal matter fields. If such fields are fermionic, as posited in I, they must be
also be vector-like [11, 12] with respect to the SM to avoid both gauge anomalies and any conflict with
precision electroweak measurements [13]. This led us to consider the rather unique possibility that portal
matter can only transform as vector-like copies [11] of one or more of the usual SM fermion fields1 . In I,
in order to obtain a finite, radiatively generated , we considered toy models wherein the portal matter
consisted of two vector-like copies of a single SM field with opposite dark charges thus rendering  finite
in a rather trivial manner. However, there we also briefly discussed the more complex, and perhaps much
more interesting, possibility that portal matter may consist of a set of different vector-like fields with
various SM quantum numbers whose infinite contributions to  ‘naturally’ cancel amongst themselves, as
might be the case if they formed, e.g., a 5 + 5̄ of SU (5), as a potential way forward in constructing more
realistic UV-complete theories. This is the direction that we will follow in this paper.
An extension of the SM by an additional 5 + 5̄ of SU (5) cannot help but remind (some of) us of
grand unification based on the group E6 , where such an additional set of fields naturally occurs [15].
Such models proved of great phenomenological interest some time ago in connection with the early
developments in string theory [15] in the late-80’s. In such a framework, not only was the matter sector
of the SM extended but also generally present were SM gauge sector augmentations by various species of
U (1) and/or SU (2) factors increasing the complexity of the resulting phenomenology. Of course, in the
case under discussion here, the obvious gauge sector extension of interest is U (1)D for which all of the
SM fields are neutral, unlike what we find in the case of new the U (1)’s which appear in E6 . However,
also with an eye towards future work, some of the basic ideas in E6 -type setups, as we will see below, can
1 We

note that such PM states have gotten little attention in the literature [14].

provide a good jumping-off point for moving forward. The fact that the SM fields all have QD = 0 tells
us that we will actually need to go beyond the simple E6 picture to obtain a viable model, as has been
recently noted in the literature [16], and we will take a bottom up approach in extending the E6 setup in
what follows. The general setup which we present below is, to say the least, somewhat fine-tuned; how
much that should disturb us at this point is up to one’s tastes. However, we should be reminded that
the work here presents only a preliminary step on the way to a more UV-complete theory involving the
SM, DM and the portal matter responsible for their mutual interaction, which may result in a reduction
of this fine-tuning or at least make such fine-tuning more palatable.
The outline of this paper is as follows: Section 2 contains a general background discussion and an
overview of our model setup using arguments from both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Section 3
provides a discussion on the various components of our setup in the gauge and fermion sectors and the
relevant couplings and mixings among the physical states relevant for the discussions that follow. Section
4 contains a mainly collider-oriented view of some of the physics associated with the new exotic particles
we have introduced while Section 5 contains a discussion of some DM physics within the present setup.
Finally, the last Section summarizes our results and conclusions and points us in the direction of our next
steps.

Background and Model Setup

In order to attempt to construct a GUT-inspired, UV-complete theory of both the dark matter (DM)
and portal matter (PM) sectors as well as their interactions with the SM it is necessary to have some
preliminary target properties in mind that we would expect such a theory to possess. Similarly, we should
have a parallel set of, potentially overlapping, expectations for the low(er)-energy theory operating at the
∼ few TeV scale and below as clearly one might also anticipate that the lower-energy theory will inherit
some of the properties found in the high-scale theory. As was discussed briefly in I and mentioned above
in the Introduction, to allow for their instability, new vector-like (with respect to the SM gauge group)
candidate fermionic portal matter fields in their simplest manifestation must transform in a manner
similar to that of some subset of SM fermionic representations, i.e., SU (3)c color singlets and triplets
which also fall into SU (2)L weak-isospin singlets or doublets.2 As such, these portal matter states
automatically carry a set of weak hypercharges, Yi , matching those of the corresponding conventional SM
fermions. If these portal matter fields are assigned dark charges, QDi 6= 0, then a finite, 1-loop induced
value for the KM mixing between a light, <
∼ GeV , dark U (1)D gauge field and the corresponding U (1)Y
hypercharge field, can be induced. As described above, and in the notation of I, the parameter describing
this KM is essentially given by

where gD,Y are the U (1)D,Y gauge couplings and ‘pole’ is the usual singular plus mass-independent

i Di = 0 is satisfied. From a purely low-energy perspective, this requirement would appear to be

ad hoc but should be expected to be a natural property of the UV-theory as was speculated in I. As is
well-known, in a GUT-like framework, for any given representation, T r Ti Tj = 0 (i 6= j) is found to hold
automatically for any two distinct generators, Ti , which in the case at hand renders the KM parameter 
finite and calculable in such models [10] if both Y and QD correspond to (linear combinations of distinct)
generators of the UV gauge group. This calculability of the analogs of  in GUT theories with split
representations was already made use of long ago [10] for model-building/phenomenological purposes.
To gain some further insight into these issues and to provide a point of departure for the analysis that
follows, let us briefly consider the anomaly-free GUT group E6 [15] whose fundamental representation,
27, contains the usual fifteen SM chiral fermions together with twelve additional ‘exotic’, (almost) vector2 Note

that this is already suggestive that a symmetry may exist relating these portal matter fields to their SM ‘partners’.

like fermions (VLF). Of particular interest to us here is the decomposition of E6 into one of its maximal
subgroups SU (2)I × SU (6) [17] under which the fundamental 27 representation decomposes as 27 →
(2, 6̄) + (1, 15), where the first[second] number is the dimension of the corresponding SU (2)I [SU (6)]
representation. This SU (2)I gauge group will play an important role in our discussion below. When the
SU (6) group then breaks to the familiar SU (5) × U (1)6 , where SU (5) will be used here in the following
discussion as just a proxy for the SM, one then has 27 → (2, 5̄)−1 + (2, 1)5 + (1, 5)−4 + (1, 10)2 where
the second number now labels the SU (5) representation and the numbers written as subscripts are the
corresponding U (1)6 charges. Here we see the well-known result that the new exotic fermions lie in a pair
of SU (5) 5 + 5̄ representations as well as a pair of SU (5) singlets. Following [15] we will denote the vector
(left-handed) fields in the 5̄ as (N, E)TL , hcL , with the corresponding conjugate fields in the 5. While hcL
is a color (anti-)triplet, weak isosinglet, transforming similarly to ∼ dcL , (N, E)TL is a color singlet, weak
isodoublet, transforming similarly to ∼ (ν, e)TL , and together with the content of the 5 these fields form
a set of fermions which are vector-like with respect to the SM. The additional SM singlets in the (2, 1)5
are usually suggestively denoted as ν c and S c [15] but here we simply refer to them as S1,2 . Why is
this E6 structure interesting from the portal matter perspective? Here we have an anomaly-free setup
which already contains vector-like fermions which transform under the SM in a manner analogously to
(some of) the SM fermions thus being able to play the role of portal matter and which are related to
the SM by the action of the SU (2)I group, i.e., the value of T3I differentiates the SM from exotic fields.
Such a possibility was already foreseen in I. Furthermore, if we were to (mistakenly as we will soon see)
identify QD with this diagonal generator then the above requirement, the condition T rY QD = 0 would
be automatically satisfied so that  would indeed be finite and calculable at 1-loop as desired. One could
go even further and imagine that at some large scale, say ∼ 10 TeV, the breaking SU (2)I → U (1)D via
(†)
a real SU (2)I triplet thus giving heavy masses to the non-hermitian ‘off-diagonal’ WI gauge bosons
coupling to the non-hermitian pair of SU (2)I isospin raising and lowering operators and thus identifying
the diagonally coupled WI0 with the dark photon which is left to get mass at the ∼ GeV scale or below.
Assuming that the SU (2)I gauge coupling, gI , is even remotely close in magnitude to the usual weak
coupling this seemingly successful and interesting approach hits a significant snag, i.e., in such a setup the
dark photon will have significant couplings, ∼ gI T3I , to some of the SM fields (since they carry T3I 6= 0)
beyond those usually induced by the loop-suppressed KM. This is inconsistent with the desired properties
of the dark photon outlined above; thus, we see that we cannot make the identification of QD with T3I ,
and that the dark photon cannot be embedded in this simple E6 -inspired framework. This setup does
have a number of very nice features, albeit with some important ingredients that are still missing. To
keep these nice features while repairing the problems we need to go beyond the simple E6 framework.
First, let us establish some simplifying notation; we will denote the SM SU (3)c ×SU (2)L ×U (1)Y group
structure as 3c 2L 1Y . Similarly, the above E6 decomposition would then be written as E6 → 2I 6 → 2I 516
and the relevant gauge group above the ∼ 10 TeV scale described above then would be 3c 2L 1Y 2I , since
14−16
SU (5) is broken at the very high mass scale >
GeV. Next, we will take a bottom-up approach to
∼ 10
discover what it is we need to add to the previous E6 -inspired setup to maintain the attractive features
above while avoiding the dark photon coupling problem. For the moment, we keep the fermionic matter
content of the model the same as that in the previous paragraph. Let us imagine that we augment the 2I
gauge group by an additional U (1)I 0 = U (1)IY (which we will use interchangeably below) with its own
gauge coupling gI0 (= gIY ) so that above ∼ 10 TeV the relevant group is now 3c 2L 1Y 2I 1IY . In such an
approach, the relevant KM is then between
P the usual SM hypercharge gauge boson and the corresponding
gauge boson of 1IY so that, e.g.,  ∼ i Yi YIi ln(m2i /µ2 ). In a sense the SM electroweak group is now
seen to be ‘mirrored’ in ‘I-space,’ but with several important differences. We now further imagine that
at the ∼ 10 TeV breaking scale 2I 1IY → 1D , i.e., U (1)D with a (at this scale) massless dark photon via
a 2I doublet vev (which we’ll call vI for the moment), in a manner completely analogous to the Higgs in
the SM. This is now very familiar physics: to first approximation the WI get a mass 'p
gI vI /2 while the
ZI , which couples to a linear combination of the T3I and YI generators, gets a mass ' gI2 + gI02 vI /2 so
that MZI = MWI /cI , etc, (where cI = cos θI with tan θI = gIY /gI , again in complete analogy with the
SM). Similarly, the dark photon, which couples to the combination QI = T3I + YI /2 remains, massless
down to the ∼ 1 GeV scale where U (1)D , literally dark QED, is broken. Note that quite generally the
couplings of the ZI to the additional E6 matter fields will now be quite different than in the E6 case
itself due to the additional U (1)IY factor. Furthermore, for a range of xI = s2I > 0.75, the ZI can decay
3

to WI WI† , which is kinematically forbidden in the ordinary E6 -inspired setup.
The low-energy theory, at/below ∼ 10 TeV, in now seen to have 3 relevant, but widely separated,
scales: ∼ 10 TeV where a vev ∼ vI breaks 2I 1IY → 1D , the usual ∼ 250 GeV electroweak scale where
2L 1Y → 1QED and the ∼ GeV scale where 1D is broken and the dark photon obtains a mass. We
now ask: in such a setup is it possible to assign the YI charges consistently to the various 3c 2L 1Y 2I 1IY
matter representations so that QI = 0 holds for all SM fields while the exotic fermions carry QI 6= 0,
thus allowing us to identify QI with QD ? As we will shortly see the answer to this question is in the
affirmative.
Since, as we will see, all of the fermions in the 27 of E6 which transform non-trivially under 2I must
also have 1IY charges, while the SM fermions which are singlets under 2I must not receive 1IY charges
to avoid coupling to the dark photon, it is immediately clear that we cannot identify 1IY with the 16
arising from the E6 breaking above. This implies that 1IY is not a subgroup of E6 , and furthermore that
the relevant GUT-like group is not the direct product E6 × 1IY , as this would cause all fields in the 27
to have the same charge under 1IY . 3 . Hence, at higher scales 3c 2L 1Y 2I 1IY (or more compactly 2I 1IY 5)
must be part of a larger group, e.g., SU (8), which does not contain E6 as a subgroup. Thus, while E6 has
and will continue to inspire and provide us some guidance in our model construction, especially in the
matter sector, it will not directly feature in the final UV aspects of the present work. In later work [19]
we will more explicitly discuss how the present framework fits into a more unified GUT-like structure.

Realizing the Bottom-Up Model
Basic Model Structure

Although we will not make explicit use of the E6 group below, comparisons with that quite familiar
scenario which leads to the additional SU (2)I gauge group with the specific model we consider here will
often prove useful. At the most basic level of 3c 2L 1Y 2I 1I 0 , the fermion fields as described above will fall
into a number of distinct representations. Here, where relevant, we assign the (conjugate) SM fields to
be the T3I = 1/2(−1/2) ‘upper (lower) member’ of 2I left-handed doublets with the corresponding exotic
(conjugate) fields then having T3I = −1/2(1/2). The fields in the familiar SU (5) 10 representation:
(u, d)TL , ucL , ecL are thus singlets under 2I 1I 0 in analogy with the case describe above, i.e., (u, d)TL ∼
(3, 2, 1/6, 1, 0), ucL ∼ (3̄, 1, 2/3, 1, 0) and ecL ∼ (1, 1, 1, 1, 0) under 3c 2L 1Y 2I 1I 0 , respectively.4 On the other
hand, all the other exotic fields (and the remaining SM ones) are then found to transform non-trivially,
e.g., (E c , N c )TL ∼ (1, 2, 1/2, 1, 1) and hL ∼ (3, 1, −1/3, 1, 1). The remaining leptonic fields are then seen
to form a bi-doublet under 2L 2I similar to what one encounters in the Left-Right Symmetric Model
[18], [(ν, e)T ; (N, E)T ]L ∼ (1, 2, −1/2, 2, −1/2) with the 2L (2I ) generators acting vertically(horizontally)
while (hc , dc , )L is an 2L singlet but an 2I doublet ∼ (3̄, 1, 1/3, 2, −1/2). Finally, we also have the SM
singlets (S2 , S1 )L ∼ (1, 1, 0, 2, −1/2); as a further distinction from the pure E6 model we will now make
this representation also vector-like under 2I by adding the corresponding conjugate fields, (S1c , S2c )L ∼
(1, 1, 0, 2, 1/2), to the spectrum which will assist in our model-building efforts below. Note that this is
a particular convenient choice and alternatives are possible where these fields remain 2-component fields
which obtain a Majorana mass. A short calculation shows that indeed the fermionic contributions to
T rY YI = 0 so that  is in fact finite and calculable in this setup (assuming a similar cancellation happens
in the scalar sector). It is also important to note that the above assignments lead to QI = T3I + YI /2 = 0
for all SM fields (and also S2 ) while their exotic partners have QI (hL,R ) = 1 and QI (N, E, S1 )L,R = −1
so that the dark photon, V = AI , prior to mixing does not couple to the SM but couples in a vector-like
manner to all the exotic fermions. Note further that T rQI = 0 as one might expect from any linear
combination of GUT (here SU (6)-like) generators. In general, it may be that the exotics pair up only
with one of the SM generations and not the others or that there are exotic partners for all three SM
generations; we will keep these possibilities open in the discussion below but for convenience continue to
3 We note that the generator Y does not, in fact, commute in general with those of E , so this is not just E × U (1) 0

and instead some other large unification group would be relevant at very high scales.
4 Note that when discussing SM fermions we will employ first generation labels.

employ first generation labels, constructing the model in a single generation language.
An observation that we will not make use of here to keep the discussion general is that the fermion
and Higgs fields that we introduce naturally fit into the embedding 2I 1I 0 → 3I , with SU (3)I broken at an
even larger mass scale. We will return to this observation in later work as it provides one of the natural
next steps in the constructing of a more UV-complete model.
Given the augmentation of both the low-energy (∼ 10 TeV) gauge group and the particle content
one can ask if the gauge and mixed gauge-gravity anomalies still cancel in the case of 3c 2L 1Y 2I 1I 0 as
they did automatically in the previously described E6 group; the vector-like nature of much of the above
structure is helpful here, but we note that fermion fields are generally not vector-like under 2I 1I 0 itself.5
As might be expected, all of the dozen or so potential anomaly contributions involving only SM gauge
fields or admixtures of SM gauge fields with those of 2I 1I 0 or gravity are found to cancel completely as
3
do those arising from SU (2)3I , i.e., T r T3I
(= 0), and the mixed gauge-gravity case T r YI (= 0). However,
two of the necessary anomaly-free conditions (assuming only a single generation of exotic fermions),
2
T r T3I
(YI /2) = −5/4 and T r (YI /2)3 = 15/4, are clearly non-zero so that further additional fermions
must be added to the spectrum. Provided that they are SM singlets, which is certainly the simplest
possibility, we need only ensure that the condition T r YI = 0 remains valid when these new fermions are
included. There are several possible solutions, with the simplest being the addition of a left-handed 2I
triplet, TL , with YI /2 = 1 plus a left-handed 2I doublet, DL , with YI /2 = −3/2; the specific choice of
such new fields will not be of direct interest in the discussion below. Of course, in a bottom-up approach
we can always add further vector-like fermions as long as they don’t spoil this anomaly cancellation.
These fields will play very little role in the phenomenological discussions below. The fermionic content
of the model discussed in above, including the minimal content required for anomaly cancellation, is
summarized in Table 1.
In order to generate all of the gauge and fermion masses as well as the appropriate hierarchy of mass
scales, ∼ 10 TeV, ∼ 250 GeV and ∼ at most a few GeV, several different Higgs fields are required which
will transform non-trivially under the SM, 2I 1I , or both. This requires a scalar sector only slightly larger
than in the usual SU (2)I model with some parameter tuning necessary to generate the hierarchal vev
structure. The easiest way to uncover these Higgs fields is to require that all of the previously discussed
fermions obtain masses at the appropriate scales while simultaneously maintaining the desired hierarchy
of gauge symmetry breakings. This will, of course, require siome fine-tuning in the Higgs potential. The
simplest situation is the case of the u-quark, as neither of its chiral components carries any 2I 1I 0 quantum
numbers. A conventional SM-like Higgs doublet H1 = (H + , H 0 )T ∼ (1, 2, 1/2, 1, 0) can thus generate a

from which it is clear that H2 is a 2L 2I bidoublet, H2 ∼ (1, 2, −1/2, 2, 1/2). We have adopted the
convention that SU (2)L indices i label rows while SU (2)I indices I label columns. Note that since both
√
of the T3L = 1/2 entries in H2 are electrically neutral, h01,2 , both of these fields may obtain vevs, v1,2 / 2,
with v2 ∼ 100 GeV. Since QI (h01,2 ) = 1, 0, v2 (in combination with v above) breaks the SM gauge group
but has no impact on U (1)D . On the other hand, since h01 carries a dark charge its vev generates a mass
for the dark photon and so v1 ∼ a few GeV or less. Thus we see that while v2 generates the d mass,
v1 6= 0 generates mass-mixing between d and h, a role filled by the dark Higgs in I. Furthermore, as
we will see below, since h01 has both T3L and QI 6= 0 it also generates a mass mixing between the dark
photon and the SM Z which is not suppressed by a KM factor but (essentially) only the vev hierarchy
5 We note that the fermions in analogous SU (2) situation are also not vector-like under 2 , but that did not prevent

simultaneously breaking 2I 1I 0 → 1D giving masses to the WI and ZI gauge bosons. Since QI (h04 ) 6= 0
the vev v4 ∼ a few GeV or less contributes to the breaking of 1D (while not generating any additional
Z-dark photon mixing) and leads to a further contribution to e−E and d−h mass mixing (of the opposite
helicity) at the ∼ GeV scale. Finally, we note that at this level of discussion (S2 , S1 ) can have a bare Dirac
mass term, M , consistent with all the 3c 2L 1Y 2I 1I 0 gauge symmetries. For now it will be assumed that M
can be either quite large, of order the scale of scale of 2I breaking, or might be small as <

could instead choose the potentially more interesting path to make the Si Majorana fields employing an
SU (2)I triplet in the case when the exotic fields come in two or more generations. Furthermore, perhaps
even more interestingly, we could imagine even more complex scenarios where other mass terms exist
due linking the Si with the other neutral fields ν, N so that we can make interesting models of neutrino
masses; this will require additional Higgs fields. However, neither of these paths will be followed here
and we leave this for later work. We emphasize that we are free to add additional (vector-like) fermion
fields, so long as they don’t violate the ‘finiteness’ condition T rY YI = 0. Finally, note that we will also
add one new SU (2) singlet, electrically charged scalar, H4 ∼ (1, 1, 1, 1, 1), which (clearly) does not get a
vev, and is introduced solely to ensure that the scalar contributions to T rY YI vanishes in this bottom-up
construction, playing no role in the phenomenology below. The various Higgs fields, and their vevs, are
summarized in Table 2. Note that the Higgs sector structure just described is somewhat more complex
than seen in the traditional SU (2)I scenario, though they both have many of the same features.
Now that we have elucidated the necessary set of Higgs fields needed to generate all the fermion
masses and the breakings of the necessary gauge symmetries we can write the corresponding potential in
the form
V =µ21 H1† H1 + µ22 Tr(H2† H2 ) + µ23 H3† H3 + µ24 |H4 |2 + λ1 (H1† H1 )2 + λ2 [Tr(H2† H2 )]2

(7)

+ λ9 |H4 |2 Tr(H2† H2 ) + λ10 H3† H3 |H4 |2 + ρH3 H̃2† H1 + ρ∗ H1† H̃2 H3† ,
where we have maintained the convention that H3 = (h03 h04 ) and H1 = (H + H 0 )T , and we have defined
H̃2 ≡ H2∗ . The phase of the coupling ρ may be absorbed into the relative phases of H1 and H3 , leaving
us with 17 real parameters. From the form of this potential it is obvious that after spontaneous symmetry
breaking several fine-tunings in the various parameters are necessary to generate the required hierarchy
of the vevs discussed above.
From this discussion, and as we will see below, it is clear that the dark photon will eventually couple to
the SM fields in several ways: (i) via the usual KM ∼ eQ, (ii) via -unsuppressed mass mixing with the
SM Z boson induced by v1 6= 0 and (iii) via the v1,4 6= 0 induced mass mixing of the exotic fermions with
their SM partners. Note that the latter two possibilities automatically lead to parity-violating interactions
of the dark photon with (some of) the SM fields. If all these effects are of a similar magnitude the nature
of the dark photon interactions with the SM fields may be quite different than is usually anticipated.

Gauge Boson Masses and KM

The couplings of the various physical gauge fields to the previously introduced fermions and scalars is
determined by both the presence of KM as well as mass mixing among the various weak eigenstates.
Based upon the Higgs sector described in the previous subsection, it is straightforward to determine to
leading order the masses of the non-hermitian gauge fields, i.e., the SM W and the WI which couple to
the two sets of raising and lowering operators of the two SU (2)’s; these (diagonal) mass terms are given

based on the suggestive numerical values discussed above. Here we can define the sum

vSM = v + v22 for later use below. As in the type-II Two Higgs Doublet Model [20], we see that v gives
mass to the u quarks while v2 provides mass to the SM d quarks; by analogy, we may write v = vSM sin β
and v2 = vSM cos β in familiar notation. Note that WI can have sub-leading mixings with the neutral
hermitian gauge bosons, primarily with the dark photon, via the v1,4 vevs that we will discuss further
below.
In the case of the real neutral, diagonally-coupled gauge bosons, the relevant part of the covariant
derivative (suppressing Lorentz indices here) is given in the weak basis by the combination

(9)

Before we can analyze the masses and couplings of the three massive neutral hermitian gauge bosons
in the present setup, we first must remove the effects of KM that arise from a Lagrangian term, now
following conventional normalization, of the form (keeping the ‘w ↔ I 0 symmetry)
LKM =

(10)

where B̂µν is the field strength the SM 1Y gauge field, B̂Iµν is the corresponding 1I 0 field strength and
where the finite value of the fermionic contributions to  (which, to be general, we will assume are chiral)
are now given in the notation above by

(11)

An additional overall factor of 1/2 is present in the corresponding sum of potential complex scalar
contributions. Here we see explicitly that in this setup the exotic vector-like fermions as well as their
SU (2)I (bi)doublet SM partners are both playing the role of portal matter fields. In the case of a single
generation of exotic fermions we can already evaluate this sum explicitly to find that (treating the Dirac

where the term in the square bracket is O(1) (and likely to be negative) since there are no large hierarchies
anticipated. Since  ∼ 10−(3−4) we can safely work, most of the time, to leading order in this parameter,
removing the KM by the mapping B̂ → B + BI /(cw cI ) and B̂I → BI and dropping terms of O(2 ) or
smaller. Following this step, it is useful to make the following familiar rotations as the mass eigenstates
are not far from the usual SM expectations, with A, Z being the usual SM fields:
W3 = cw Z + sw A

B = cw A − sw Z ,

(13)

and correspondingly for the 2I 1I 0 gauge fields with sw → sI , etc. Then the above piece of the covariant

To determine the gauge boson masses we recall that the above covariant derivative expression acts on
a set of electrically neutral Higgs multiplet members so that T3L |vevs >= − Y2 |vevs >. In the case of
ZI , the η1 term only acts on Higgs fields which have SM couplings and which have vevs much smaller
than v3 . Since this term is already  suppressed it can be dropped. Thus, to leading order in the small
parameters and hierarchical squared vev ratios, the relevant piece of the covariant derivative acting on
Higgs vevs is simply (recalling that some Higgs carry QI 6= 0)

as expected. While AI − ZI mixing is seen to be very highly suppressed by the ratios v1,4

Z − ZI and Z − AI mixing may be of some phenomenological importance. To leading order in the vev

SM fields through its mixing with the Z which, after some algebra, implies that AI now would couple to
the combination
g
gI sI QI + eQ − σ (T3L − s2w Q) .
(23)
cw
Recall that eI = gI sI is what one usually calls the ‘dark’ coupling, gD , in an EFT approach. Note
that the Z-like coupling term, proportional to σ ∼ 10−4 for typical parameter values, is absent in
most treatments but arises here due to a Higgs field in the bi-doublet carrying both weak isospin and,
effectively, a non-zero value of QI . Such a term clearly produces parity violation, which can lead to
important phenomenological implications. Also, importantly, AI via σ 6= 0 now necessarily couples to
the SM neutrinos in a generation-independent manner, leading to potential impact in sensitive neutrino
experiments such as DUNE. Correspondingly, due to this mixing, the physical AI mass to NLO in the
small parameters from the above considerations is
MA2 I = gI2 s2I (v12 + v42 ) + σ(2tw − σ)MZ2 ,

(24)

where the second term, which can sometimes be numerically important for lighter dark photons and
can be of either sign, is also new and thus can be of some general significance. To see that both signs
are possible in principle, consider the ratio r0 = σ/(tw ) so that the coefficient of the MZ2 term is just
r0 (2 − r0 )(tw )2 . Numerically, we indeed find that r0 can easily be O(1):

so that the additional term can be negative for some parameter space regions. We note, however, that
−(3−4)
for dark photon masses >
the first term in the expression above is likely
∼ 50 − 100 MeV and  <
∼ 10
to be the far dominant one.
Thus far we have not analyzed the impact of the light vevs v1,4 6= 0. Since these lead to the breaking
(†)
of U (1)D , thereby generating the AI mass, the non-hermitian fields WI may also mix (slightly) with
both the ZI and AI by terms such as
gI2 sI v3 v4
√
(WI + WI† )(AI − tI ZI ) .
2 2

(26)

While the ZI physics we are concerned with here is not at all significantly influenced by this effect, for
AI this mixing induces an additional new coupling term given by
− gI sI


v4 +
TI + TI− ,
v3

(27)

where TI± are the SU (2)I raising and lowering operators. Here we see that although AI mixes with the
non-hermitian WI and WI† , it does so in such a way that AI remains real, as it should. Note that this
new interaction is only suppressed by a single power of v4 /v3 ∼ 10−4 ∼ , so it can be of some numerical
consequence and leads to an off-diagonal coupling between the exotic fermions and their SM partners for
the dark photon. Further note that a second term of this type of order v1 v2 /v32 is also induced, but it is
numerically negligible in that the further shift in AI couplings is only of the order ∼ 10−6 . When both
of these WI and †I terms are combined they lead to a negative shift in AI mass squared δm2AI ' −gI2 s2I v42
which is of the same order as discussed already above, resulting in the final leading order result for the
physical AI mass squared given by
MA2 I = gI2 s2I v12 + σ(2tw − σ)MZ2 .

(28)

As noted above, for the parameter ranges of interest to us we expect that the first term will generally be
numerically dominant in this expression.
Without studying the details of the rather complex Higgs potential of this setup described above

10

(which is beyond the scope of the present work) we can make some simple observations with respect to
the numbers of degrees of freedom that remain after spontaneous symmetry breaking; the most straightforward case is the number of charged states. H1 contains one charged state H + , while the bi-doublet
H2 contains two, h−
1,2 , and one linear combination of these three states must be eaten to supply the
longitudinal components of WL± implying that (including also the state H4 ) three charged states remain
in the physical spectrum. In the neutral Higgs sector there are a total of 10 real fields: 5 CP-even states
and 5 CP-odd states. In the case of original five CP-odd neutral fields, we need to supply longitudinal
components to the ZI , Z, and AI , which implies that three linear combinations of the CP-odd states
become Goldstone bosons. The AI likely eats some combination of the QI 6= 0 CP-odd a01,4 states. The
(†)

(†)

final gauge boson in need of a longitudinal component is WI . Since it carries a non-zero QI , WI
must eat both a real CP-even state, likely some linear combination of h04 and h01 , as well as a CP-odd
state, likely the linear combination of a01 and a04 not eaten by the AI . Thus, we find that four CP-odd
states and one CP-even state become goldstone bosons, leaving 5 neutral real scalars remaining in the
spectrum, made of some linear combinations of the 4 uneaten CP-even states and 1 uneaten CP-odd
state. We identify one of these linear combinations, most likely an admixture of the CP-even isodoublet
fields within H 0 and h02 , with the SM Higgs.

3.3

Fermion Mixing

As was seen in the previous section, the exotic fermions naturally mix with their SM SU (2)I partners
via the same set of Yukawa couplings that generate all of the ‘diagonal’ fermion masses themselves.
There are several model-building possibilities here, but for simplicity of our discussion we will assume
that this mixing only occurs with the first generation. It is easy to mutate this into the case where the
mixing is dominated by a different generational choice, where multiple families of exotic states exist each
mixing primarily with a single SM generation, and the more general case where the mixing can be quite
complex. In this simple single generation case that we consider, e.g., the 2 × 2 d − h mass matrix in the
0

where we have defined m0d,h = λd,h v2,3 / 2 employing the notation above. Clearly since the off-diagonal
elements are ‘small’, straightforward algebra leads to m0d,h ' md,h , which are the corresponding physical
particle masses, to a very good approximation. This mass matrix is easily diagonalized, as usual, via
0
the bi-unitary transformation MD = UR Md UL† , where MD is diagonal so that DL,R = UL,R DL,R
are the

where, as we saw above, θR ' −v4 /v3 is of order , and can be phenomenologically important. Note that
these same conclusions would hold if h mixed with any of the three SM generations. A very similar result
is obtained in the case of e−E mixing with identical results as above, but with the interchange UL ↔ UR .
These results are qualitatively similar to what was obtained in I and lead to similar phenomenological
11

implications as we will discuss below.
We now see that the combined effect of the AI coupling term ∼ (TI+ + TI− ) discussed in the last
subsection above and the fermion mixing seen here now yields an effective exotic-SM off-diagonal coupling
for the dark photon that is not explicitly  suppressed and is given by

with a similar result holding in the case of, e.g., e − E mixing with mh → mE and with R → L in the
expressions above. Here we see that this coupling is roughly of order , as will generally be assumed in
the phenomenological analysis below and as was anticipated in I. From this expression we can determine
the induced coupling of the longitudinal component of AI to this current structure as well as that of the
associated Goldstone boson by employing the Equivalence Theorem [21]. Approximating mAI = gI sI v1
in our mass range of interest (given the arguments above), we find that the overall strength of this
interaction, λ, is given by

especially if v4 > v1 which can easily happen. This is semi-quantitatively similar to what we obtained in
I for the toy model we constructed there. As was found there, this implies that decays such as h → dAI
or E → eAI via the AI ’s longitudinal component experience no -like suppression and will be completely
dominant over other anticipated processes such as h → dZ, H and h → uW . The fact λ is O(1) leads to
numerous phenomenological implications, some of which were hinted at in I. Explicitly, the Goldstone
boson associated with AI , i.e., GAI , has an off-diagonal coupling given by
¯ L )GA ,
iλ(h̄dR − dh
I

(34)

with an analogous term, e.g., for E − e-type interactions with the opposite helicity structure. It is easy
to see that the physical CP-even scalar state(s) containing a significant Reh04 component will also have
¯ L )S, as was found
off-diagonal, SM-exotic fermion couplings of very similar strength, i.e., ∼ λ(h̄dR + dh
in the toy model presented in I. This state would essentially be the real, CP-even partner to the CP-odd
AI ’s associated Goldstone boson above. In the limit where the 2I 1IY breaking scale becomes large, as in
the toy model case, we would expect that this real scalar state, S, is light, <
∼ a few GeV, and with a mass
set by the U (1)D breaking scale. Without a detailed study of the Higgs potential of the present setup
shown above (which is comparable in complexity in our case compared to, e.g., that of the Left-Right
Symmetric model with Dirac neutrinos [29], though here there is no L-R symmetry relating the 17 free
parameters in the potential), which is beyond the scope of the present work, we will assume that the
vacuum structure of potential allows this state to be present in the spectrum with the anticipated mass
and couplings as in I.
The introduction of vector-like fermions which mix with SM fermions via Yukawa couplings, as outlined
above, may induce new flavor changing neutral currents through, e.g., the SM Z boson coupling. FCNCs
in this context have been studied in the literature [22–24], and are proportional to products of the VLFSM Yukawa couplings and the ratio of the SM vev to the VLF mass, λi λ∗j v 2 /M 2 . The case here is slightly
different, however, as the mixing between the VLF and the SM fermions are only non-negligible for the
SM fermion which transforms the same way under the SM gauge groups as the VLF, i .e. above we have
dR − hR and eL − EL mixing but no dL − hL or eR − ER mixing at order . Since the fermions which
experience mass mixing couple identically to the Z, there are no Z-mediated FCNCs in this model at
order  6 . Nevertheless, we see there are FCNCs also mediated by the dark photon AI which we will
briefly discuss, using the down-like quark sector as an example.
The most general flavor structure of this model has an additional set of VLFs for each generation, so
0
that the relationship between the mass eigenstates and the gauge eigenstates, DR = UR DR
, becomes a
6 We note that Z mediated FCNCs do occur due to mixing in the left-handed down-like quark sector, but as noted in
the above analysis of UL , we expect these terms to be O(10−(10−16) ), depending on the mass of the down-like quark, and
we will neglect these couplings.

Since the AI is much lighter than the SM Z, it may be produced on-shell in meson decays, which
could provide constraints on the flavor sector of these models. As an example, we consider the tree-level
processes b → s + AI , b → d + AI , and s → d + AI , with a long-lived AI which escapes the detector.
These decays mimic the SM processes B → Kν ν̄, B → πν ν̄, and K → πν ν̄, respectively, and thus may
be constrained by limits on the branching fractions of these decay channels. We estimate the branching
fractions for the corresponding new physics processes B → KAI , B → πAI , and K → πAI using the
hadronic form factors of refs. [25, 26], taking mAI = mlight , the mass of the light meson in the decay
product, and assuming gI2 s2I ' 0.1. Our estimates of these branching fractions and the current limits are
summarized in Table 3.
From these estimates we see that the observed branching fraction of K + → π + ν ν̄ is quite constraining

We note that FCNCs may also impact neutral meson oscillations, but due to the light mass of the
AI these effects are difficult to estimate, and an analysis of the impact of weakly coupled FCNCs with
light mediators on neutral meson oscillations is beyond the scope of the present work. Further, we note
that a similar set of AI -mediated FCNCs will be present in the lepton sector, which could be probed
by, e.g., µ → e measurements, though the rate would be suppressed by a factor of 2 v44 /v34 ∼ 10−24 at
least. Decays forbidden in the SM, such as K + → π + µ+ e− , could also provide a very clean probe of the
FCNCs discussed here, though this rate would be further suppressed by a factor of O(10−16 ) relative to
the K + → π + AI discussed above.

Survey of Some Bottom-Up Phenomenology

Given the rich structure we have introduced above, we might expect that this setup will have a complex
phenomenology which has partial overlap with both the SU (2)I models and that of the conventional dark
photon picture, perhaps augmented by some of what we discussed previously in I. The first and most
obvious topic to address is how the physics of the new heavy gauge bosons and exotic fermions differs
from the more familiar and well-studied SU (2)I from E6 -inspired models. One certain issue we need to
address is the nature of the interplay between the exotic and SM sectors: is there a single set of exotic

states that primarily mixes with the corresponding fields in a single SM generation (and which one is it,
e.g., do we have dominant h − d, h − s or h − b mixing?) or is there a set of exotic fields corresponding
to each generation? In traditional E6 -inspired models the answer is clear, while here we see that there
are several different possibilities which lead to somewhat different phenomenology. In the discussion that
follows we will ignore issues related to flavor-changing processes and consign such discussions to later
work.
These model-dependent differences make themselves felt in even the simplest production process, i.e.,
that of ZI production in the Drell-Yan channel when the ZI can only decay to SM final states with
the most
q trivial difference being the overall ZI coupling strength which in E6 models is proportional
5s2

w
to ∼
3 due to GUT coupling requirements. Here, the overall coupling is set by gI /cI so that ZI
production cross sections can be determined up to an overall factor of r = (gI /cI )/(g/cw ) which we
expect to be O(1)7 . Of course, a potentially more significant difference is whether the ZI couples only
¯ ss̄ or bb̄ initial states (or all three) and whether it will appear in only the e+ e− , µ+ µ− , or τ + τ −
to dd,
channels (or, again, all three). For example, we are reminded that in the more well-studied case, there
is a universality of interactions among the generations so that all three initial states as well as all three
final state will contribute to the potential ZI Drell-Yan cross section and corresponding decay signatures
at the LHC. In the present situation, all of these scenarios need to be explored independently.

The simplest situation, and the one that allows us to make most direct contact with previous studies,
is the production of ZI with identical couplings to all three SM generations but which is kinematically
forbidden to decay into any of the exotic vector-like fermions or into WI WI† . In such a case, σB` in the
I /cI
NWA is shown in Fig. 1 assuming that r = gg/c
= 1; note that the overall cross section in this case is
w
independent of the value of xI (since SM states all have QI = 0) and that it is simply proportional to
r2 so that other cases are easily obtained by a simple overall rescaling. As can be seen from this Figure,
the present ATLAS null searches [30] employing 139 fb−1 of 13 TeV integrated luminosity excludes ZI
masses below ' 5.2 TeV under these set of assumptions. A similar null search performed at the 14 TeV
HL-LHC with 3 ab−1 of luminosity [32] would increase the exclusion limit on a ZI to masses below ' 5.9
TeV under the same set of assumptions.
A second possibility, as discussed above, is that only a single set of exotic fermions exist which mix
with a particular SM generation. In such a case only a single SM generation couples to ZI and so only
the searches in a particular dilepton channel are applicable for setting constraints. Thus, e.g., if only
the third generation carries non-zero 2I 1I 0 quantum numbers, the relevant process to examine is then
bb̄ → ZI → τ + τ − . We first consider the simplest case where the ZI still cannot decay to any of the exotic
states so that the cross section remains xI independent with
√ only an overall sensitivity to the coupling
ratio r as above. The production rates for this case at the s =13 and 14 TeV LHC are shown in Fig. 2

.
7 In

what follows we will employ the Narrow Width Approximation for our ZI analyses.
and in what follows, we will ignore the possible effects of small inter-generational fermion mixings which could
result in flavor-changing dark currents. Note that in the quark case this involves possible inter-generational mixings among
the right-handed fields which are not well-probed by SM measurements and may even be absent in some scenarios.

Fig. 3 then shows how these ZI production cross sections in the various dilepton channels translate
into current LHC search limits and the expectations for the HL-LHC assuming either universal couplings
or to only one of the SM generations. In order to obtain these results in the case of the τ + τ − third
generation couplings, we have recasted the results from an ATLAS bb̄ → H → τ + τ − study [31, 33]
making corrections for the acceptance differences between spin-0 and spin-1 resonances.

It is interesting to explore how these results change as we move further away from these rather vanilla
scenarios. In addition to variations in the overall coupling, i.e., r 6= 1, the ZI may also decay into one
or more exotic fermion final states and also into WI WI† which would modify the branching fraction for
the leptonic decay mode used in the search. Furthermore, the ZI may not couple universally, perhaps
¯ ss̄ or bb̄ initial states and consequently only leptonically decay to e+ e− , µ+ µ− or τ + τ − final
only to dd,
states, respectively, as we saw above. In such cases one also needs to employ the individual constraints
as applicable to each of these final states as previously considered [30].
When the ZI is sufficiently massive it can also decay into some if not all of the exotic non-SM states;
the partial widths for these decays, unlike those to SM final states, will explicitly depend upon the value
of xI . Furthermore, once xI > 0.75 the ZI → WI WI† channel also opens up via the usual non-Abelian
trilinear coupling. The main effect of these new decay modes of the ZI for our discussion is to reduce
the value of the relevant leptonic branching fraction, B` , and thus a correspondingly reduced signal rate
resulting is a suppression of the search/exclusion reach. This effect, however, is expected to be relatively
mild over most of parameter space as B` is reduced by at most a factor of ' 6.8, even in the extreme
case when all three generations of exotic states (without much phase space suppression) as well as WI WI†
are allowed to contribute to the total ZI width, and this maximum reduction only occurs when xI ' 1.
Fig. 4 gives us a feel for how large a reduction in B` may occur where, for purposes of demonstration in
the universal case, where we have included decays into 3 generations of degenerate N, E, h, S1,2 states as
well as WI WI† for xI > 0.75. Very similar reduction factors will also occur in the cases where there is
only a single generation of exotics which mix with only a single SM generation. From Fig. 4 we see that
the typical leptonic branching fraction seen here will have very little influence on the ZI search reach at
the HL-LHC.

Figure 4: Multiplicative B` suppression factor for the ZI as a function of xI due to the additional non-SM
decays into 3 generations of degenerate exotic fermions plus WI WI† (for xI > 0.75) as discussed in the
text. From bottom to top the curves assume mexotic /mZI = 0, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4, respectively.
Perhaps at a similar level of relative ‘simplicity’ is the direct pair production of the exotic fermions
h, E, N , etc, themselves which may be accessible to LHC experiments. As in I, once produced h will (far)
dominantly decay into its associated SM partner q = d, s or b, which will appear as a jet, plus AI or S
which produce either MET or lepton-jet signatures. h, being a color triplet, is certainly pair produced
via QCD from, at LO, q q̄, gg
√ annihilation, as is the case of the top quark as well as other more familiar
vector-like quarks.
For
the
s = 13 TeV LHC the cross section due to these processes is given in I while
√
for the case of s = 14 TeV [34, 35] the slightly larger cross section is shown in Fig. 5 with the caveat
17

Figure 5: Pure QCD NNLO hh̄ production cross section at the

√

s = 14 TeV LHC as a function of mh

here that no additional, non-electroweak interactions are present; this caveat needs some explanation. As
discussed in I, the decay of hh̄ are not those of conventional vector-like states but instead will lead to two,
non-back-to-back jets plus MET, if AI /S are very long-lived, or lepton-jets [36–38] if the decays occur
inside the detector. Decays of AI /S far from the detector may be captured by specialized experiments
looking for long-lived states [39, 40] such as FASER and MATHUSLA.
While the gg → hh̄ process is left unaltered by the additional interactions described above, the
q q̄ → hh̄ process may be significantly modified when q = d, s or b via a t−channel longitudinal AI
exchange (or equivalently, the GAI Goldstone boson) as well as that due to the corresponding light CPeven scalar, S, provided that the parameter λ is sufficiently large. In a similar vein, the t-channel WI
exchange may also produce a potentially important contribution but it is suppressed by both the relatively
small SU (2)I gauge coupling as well as the large mass of the WI itself; the neglect of this contribution at
this level of discussion is similar to the neglect of Z exchange in the case of top pair production within the
SM context. Clearly, the numerical impact of these new exchanges will differ significantly depending upon
which SM quark mixes with the exotic partner h. To quantify this possibility, consider the modification
to the q q̄ → hh̄ differential cross section at LO, where we will neglect the masses, <
∼ 1 GeV, of the
exchanges in the t-channel compared to other mass scales in the process. Defining the coupling ratio
χ = λ2 /(4παs ), with λ as given above, and defining z = cos θ∗ , with θ∗ being the partonic center of mass
frame scattering angle, we find, for the quark that mixes with h, that

with B1 being the conventional LO pure QCD result. The impact of this exchange will not only depend
on the value of λ, but even more importantly on which of the q = d, s, b initial state quarks participates
in the mixing with h since their parton densities are all quite different. As we will see, not only is h(h̄)

production pushed more forward(backward) due to this t−channel exchange as one might expect, but
the overall total hh̄ production cross section also increases, in some cases significantly.

Figure 6: (Top Left) Angular distribution for hh̄ production at the 14 TeV LHC assuming mh = 1.5 TeV
and where the h’s SM partner is the b quark. From bottom to top the curves assume that λ = 0, 1, 2, 3,
respectively. (Top Right) Same as the previous panel but now taking h’s SM partner to be the s quark.
(Bottom) Same as the previous panel but now taking h’s SM partner to be the d quark. Very similar
distributions are obtained when, e.g., mh = 2 TeV is assumed.
To get an idea of the impact of λ 6= 0 for the various non-universal q = d, s, b choices, we have taken
the LO q q̄ and gg processes and re-weighted them by K-factors to recover the corresponding NNLO SM
total cross section result when they are combined and λ = 0 is assumed [34, 35]. Fig. 6 shows these
modifications to the hh̄ angular distributions for the three non-universal choices assuming mh = 1.5 TeV
at the 14 TeV LHC, and taking rather large values of λ for purposes of demonstration. Here we see
the obvious result that for any fixed value of λ the overall impact of the t−channel exchange increases
dramatically as the choice of q goes from b to s to d. For example, in the case q = b, a substantial impact
is only found when λ is quite large ' 3. However, for q = d, we see that a reasonable impact is seen even
for values of λ less than unity. In all cases, as expected, we see that the impact is largest in the forward
direction due to the t− channel nature of the exchange. Since the QCD aspects of heavy vector-like
quark production are well-known [34], a measurement of the total cross section for hh̄ production would
perhaps give us a rough indication of the value of λ in some cases. Fig. 7 shows the total hh̄ cross section
at 14 TeV as a function of λ for the three choices q = b, s, d. Here we see that noticeable effects may be
visible for λ ' 3, 1 and 0.3, respectively, for these three cases.

Unlike for the QCD color triplet exotic fermion h, N and E form a vector-like SM weak isodoublet
so they can only be produced via the 2L 1Y 2I 1I 0 interactions. Apart from possible resonant production
in the decay of the ZI and WI gauge bosons (as was discussed above and will be further below), SM
W ± exchange provides the largely dominant, model-independent production mechanism at the LHC;
Z-mediated production is smaller by√roughly an order of magnitude.9 The rate for this process as a
function of mE (= mN ) for both the s = 13 and 14 TeV LHC is shown in Fig. 8, where the possible
effects of λ 6= 0 have been ignored. Here we see that such states may be visible out to masses ∼ 1.5
TeV, depending on their decays and the relevant SM backgrounds. As noted above and in I, these differ
from the vector-like leptons usually discussed, i.e., E → eAI , S rather than E → eH, eZ, νW . However,
present limits from the LHC on vector-like leptons with these ‘conventional’ decay paths are, and may
likely continue to be, rather poor due to large SM backgrounds except in the case where they mix with
the τ [41].

We now turn to the production of the WI gauge boson; there are several possible mechanisms for
this in the present setup, one of which does not occur in any form in the usual traditional treatment.
In the original SU (2)I scenario [15], it was noted that since WI coupled an exotic vector-like fermion to
a SM one it could not be singly produced at colliders in the usual Drell-Yan fashion, the only options
then being pair production via q q̄ annihilation, which we will further discuss below, or in association
with an h via gluon-quark fusion, i.e., qg → hWI where q = d, s, b. In the present setup, this represents
three distinct possibilities. The LO subprocess differential cross section for this reaction can be easily
extracted from the result given long ago (in a somewhat different context) by Ref. [43] with a few obvious
alterations, u → d, assuming coupling to the first SM generation, WR → WI , etc, including a rescaling
by overall factor of gI2 /g 2 . The resulting cross sections as a function of the WI mass for various
√ choices
of mh are shown in Fig. 9. The two upper panels correspond to the cases where q = d for s = 13
and 14 TeV, respectively, while the lower panels are for 14 TeV with q = s or b, respectively; in all
cases√one sees that a large part of the model parameter space is potentially accessible for all choices of
q at s = 14 TeV. Once WI h is produced, h → qAI , qS (with q = d, s or b) as discussed above and,
if mWI > mh,E , then WI → hq, Ee with h, E then decaying as previously described.10 For WI h, this

this possibility in this brief discussion.
10 If W is less massive than h (or E, N etc) it could possibly decay into a 3-body final state as will be discussed below.

final state is somewhat similar to that for hh̄ production as discussed above (which provides a significant
background) but with an extra jet which if not b-tagged could be easily mimicked by QCD ISR. Within
that region of parameter space where V, S decay inside the detector so that the h’s can be reconstructed,
the corresponding reconstruction of the WI mass peak using the extra q jet would substantially reduce
the QCD background. This production process requires further study.
Another possibility, which is more model-dependent but one we briefly mention here, is that the two
SM singlet states S1,2 might be relatively light with the QI = −1 state, S1 , split from and slightly heavier
than the QI = 0 state, S2 , by 2I 1I 0 gauge boson loops. In this scenario, if these states are indeed light,
WI can always decay into them. The S2 − S1 mass splitting, being radiatively generated, is rather small
so that if both states are light S1 will generally be relatively long lived due to the 3-body nature of the
decay over most of the parameter space. Hence, it may likely appear that S1 is stable on detector length
scales given the significant boost from the large WI mass. In such cases this final state appears as WI →
MET at a collider detector, implying that h − WI associated production may likely produce a monojet
signature due to the h → qAI , S decay. Of course, this scenario may be altered once any significant
mixings among all the neutral fields is taken into account.

WI may also be produced in pairs at the LHC. Since the WI is electrically neutral and carries no
weak SM charges and also QI (d) = 0, the dominant pair-production process q q̄ → WI WI† , proceeds via
s-channel ZI exchange as well as h exchange in the t-channel (whose amplitudes destructively interfere
to satisfy unitarity as s → ∞). This is similar to the SM W + W − process, but without the photon
contribution and with a massive neutrino. We recall that only two independent mass parameters, mh and
mWI , enter into the cross section for this process since MWI = MZI cI at tree level in this setup. However,
we note that both the values of (the overall factor of) (gI /g)4 and of xI = s2I are both undetermined in
the bottom-up approach that we are following here. Recall that the traditional pure SU (2)I limit of the
current setup is achieved in the xI → 0 limit so that the additional U (1) is then decoupled. Furthermore,
in the present setup, this cross section will be highly sensitive to the choice of q = d, s, b as we saw
in the case of several other production processes above. The full differential subprocess cross section
for this reaction can be extracted, with some care, from the detailed analysis presented in Ref. [44]. A
final ‘variable’ in this calculation is the width of ZI which enters into the s-channel exchange and is
particularly important for the range xI > 3/4 where ZI → WI WI† can occur on-shell as discussed above.
For a reasonable set of choices of exotic fermion mass variations, we generally find that ΓZI /MZI usually
lies in the range ∼ 0.01 − 0.03 when gI /g is not far from unity, which we will assume in the numerical
analysis that follows.

Cross sections for this process at the 14 TeV LHC are shown in Figs. 10 and 11, which show some of the
detailed model parameter dependence for this process. As noted, these can depend quite strongly on the
value of xI as it determines the ZI − WI mass relationship and thus whether or not the ZI → WI WI†
process can happen on-shell and is thus resonantly enhanced. Since on-shell ZI production has already
been discussed above, here we will mostly be interested in the case where xI < 0.75. In Fig. 10 we see
that for values of xI <
∼ 0.6 − 0.7, away from the potential ZI contribution, the cross section is only weakly
dependent on xI . We see in the top left panel that, not unexpectedly, as we increase mh we essentially
turn off the destructive s/t-channel interference and the cross section rises, reaching an asymptotic value
due to the ZI exchange diagram alone.11 For this same range of xI , with mh held fixed, the upper right
panel shows that the production rate falls rapidly with increasing mWI in a manner which is, again,
relatively insensitive to the specific value of xI . The lower panel shows the rather strong xI sensitivity
to the properties of the ZI resonance once the on-shell decay process ZI → WI WI† becomes allowed.
Similarly to the other production processes considered, this cross section depends upon the choice of
q = d, s, b. Fig. 11 shows this cross section as a function of mWI for various values of mh while holding
xI = 0.25 fixed but varying the choice of q = d, s, b as the 14 TeV LHC. Here we see that, e.g., assuming
mh = 1 TeV and demanding a target cross section of at least 10(1) ab for purposes demonstration, mWI
is restricted to be <
∼ 1.7(2.2), 1.4(1.9) and 1.1(1.5) TeV, respectively, assuming q = d, s, b. Clearly, we
see that the associated production channel generally wins in providing the largest signal rate for WI
production provided that the value of mh is not too large.

widths are potentially possible via the off-shell, three-body modes such as WI → eE ∗ → e+ e− (dd)A
where here AI is essentially the longitudinal mode, i.e., the Goldstone boson GAI . These are suppressed
by relative three-body factors of ∼ λ2 /16π 3 , which prove not be too prohibitive, and asymptotically scale
as ∼ (mWI /mE )2 . Fig. 12 shows the reduced partial width for this decay process, in units of gI λ/g,
as a function of δ = mE /MWI ; an analogous result is obtained in the case of h exchange except for an
additional multiplicative factor of ∼ 3 for color and QCD corrections.

In the present setup, WI can also be produced by a new mechanism not present in the classic SU (2)I

scenario. Since AI contains a small admixture of WI + WI† , the process q q̄ → WI AI /S + h.c. via tchannel h exchange, with q = d, s, or b becomes possible via λ 6= 0; again, we see that it is the longitudinal
component of AI (or, equivalently, the Goldstone boson GAI ) that is mainly responsible for this reaction.
This process has a kinematical advantage over both WI WI† and WI h production in that only a single
heavy particle needs to be produced in the final state and thus can lead to the largest signal cross section
for WI production in some parameter space regions. Also, unlike the pair production case, the amplitude
is proportional to the product λgI instead of gI2 ; this can be especially advantageous if λ is indeed large.
The subprocess cross section for this reaction is given (in the limit where the dark photon and light scalar
masses can be safely neglected) by

a substantially larger reach than found in the case of pair production, but is somewhat inferior to the

respectively. Depending upon the WI decay mode, this final state can also easily lead to MET, monojet

Finally, we consider the q q̄ → 2AI (2S) production process which proceeds via t- and u-channel h
exchanges. In the case of the AI final state this is by far dominated by the longitudinal polarization
mode, and so is well represented by the production of the corresponding Goldstone boson. Summing
over both final states and neglecting the AI , S masses in comparison to other mass scales, the subprocess

where a = 1 + 2m2h /ŝ and z = cos θ∗ . Note that the outgoing AI /S states will generally appear at large
pT and not along the beam directions. Examining the numerator, we see that in the limit of large mh this
cross section is pure d-wave, as we might expect from the production of pairs of identical spin-0 particles
in the final state; this is the result of the destructive interference between the t-channel and u-channel
exchange amplitudes. The resulting integrated cross section is shown in the lower left panel of Fig. 13 for
the different choices of q = d, s, b, as above. This result is numerically smaller than might be expected for
the pair production of two very light states due to this strong destructive interference, and we see that in
the large mh limit this interaction turns into an effective dim-8 operator. For the analogous q q̄ → AI S
process, where constructive interference now occurs instead, one obtains the resulting ∼ p-wave cross

which is seen in the lower right panel of Fig. 13 as a function of mh for the different choices of q = d, s, b.
Here, unlike in the case of 2S or 2AI production, we see a substantial event rate qualitatively similar to
our naive expectations. As in the case of pair production, we note that the outgoing AI /S states will
generally appear at large pT and not along the beam directions.
For both of these processes on their own, unlike the others considered previously, one sees the potential
lack of obvious signal to trigger on at the LHC if the AI /S is sufficiently boosted so that it decays far
outside the detector. In such a case one must rely on the production of (an) extra jet(s) produced by
QCD to act as a trigger to produce a monojet signature. Even in the case where AI /S decay inside the
detector, this additional radiation may act as a useful trigger.
In order to analyze the production of monojet events at the 13 TeV LHC, we use FeynRules [45]
to produce UFO files that may be passed to MadGraph5 aMC@NLO [46] in order to generate parton
level events. We generate events for 2AI , 2S, and AI S + 1-3 generator-level jets final states, as all of
these subprocesses will produce large missing ET , though the 2AI and 2S final states are suppressed
by the destructive interference between the t- and u-channels as discussed above. It is important to
include the additional generator-level hard jets in the final states, as these allow for processes with qg, q̄g,
and gg initial states to contribute to the ETmiss + jets signal, though they do not contribute to the
exclusive 2AI , 2S, AI S production considered above. At the generator level, we require the leading jet
have pT,j1 > 150 GeV and that ETmiss > 150 GeV, and that all jets have pT,j > 20 GeV. We employ the 5
flavor number scheme (5FNS), treating the b quark as massless and including it in the proton PDF, and
calculate the production cross section at leading order. These parton level events are then showered and
hadronized within Pythia 8 [47]. We use the MLM matching scheme in order to avoid double counting
jets from the parton level generation and the parton showering procedure, using the merging parameters
xqcut = 20 GeV and QCUT = 30 GeV. In order to compare generated events to present searches, we
use DELPHES 3 [48] to simulate detector effects, and make the cuts on the final states as outlined in the
most recent ATLAS search [49]. In particular, the leading jet must have pT,j1 > 250 GeV and |η| < 2.4,
ETmiss must be at least 250 GeV (this is the requirement for the IM1 search in Ref. [49], the subsequent
IM2-IM10 searches have successively higher cuts on ETmiss ), there must be no electrons with pT > 20
GeV, no muons with pT > 10 GeV, and there may be at most 4 central jets with |η| < 2.8 and pT > 30
GeV in the event. Fig. 14, left, shows the signal cross-section at the 13 TeV LHC after the IM1 cuts
have been applied as a function of the mass of the down-like quark partner h, for the cases of h coupling
individually to each of q = d, s, b as well as the universal coupling case, taking λ = 1 in all cases. The
coupling to the first generation dominates the production cross section in the universal case, and the two
are nearly equal for mh & 3 TeV.
Since the cross section scales as λ4 , the 36.1 fb−1 ATLAS monojet search can be used to constrain λ
for the various coupling scenarios. Using the tightest limit on the signal cross section from the IM1-IM10
searches of ref [49], we place an upper bound on λ for each coupling scenario as a function of the h mass,
shown in Fig. 14 right. We note that the searches with higher missing ET thresholds tend to be more
constraining, with the IM7 search, corresponding to ETmiss > 700 GeV, the most constraining for mh = 1
TeV, and the IM10 search, with ETmiss > 1 TeV, becoming the tightest constraint as mh increases. The
constraints on λ from this search are not very stringent, especially at larger mh and for the cases of h
coupling to the second and third generations. For mh = 1 TeV, we find an upper limit λ < 0.49 for the
28

universal coupling case, while the upper limits on λ for h coupling to d, s, and b are 0.59, 0.76, and 0.81,
respectively. These limits weaken considerably as mh increases,
as can be seen in Fig. 14. One may
√
expect increased sensitivity in this search channel at the s = 14 TeV HL-LHC, but even a gain of ∼23
in sensitivity only translates in to a factor of ∼ 2.2 in λmax , since the cross section scales as λ4 .

Dark Matter?

An issue that we have not yet addressed is the identity of the DM state in the present setup14 . By
definition, we require that this DM state be a stable, SM singlet which predominantly couples to us via
the dark photon and, hence, must necessarily have QD 6= 0. Among the set of exotic fermions introduced
in our discussion so far, we see that the QD = −1 state S1 , which sits in an SU (2)I × U (1)YI isodoublet
and is vector-like with respect to this gauge group, would naturally fulfill these basic desired requirements.
Considered in isolation, S1 , together with S2 , will have a common Dirac mass, M , but radiative corrections
will split these two states with the S1 state ending up being the heavier of the two and thus disqualifying
it as a stable DM possibility. Since QD (S1 ) = 0, it too is not a DM candidate since it does not couple
to AI . Furthermore, given the set of Higgs fields that we have already introduced above, Hi , most of
the neutral fermion states ν, N, S1,2 will generally obtain Dirac masses and mix amongst themselves such
that their gauge interactions will allow for their eventual decays down to SM particles and thus none
of them can be the required stable DM. Interestingly, at the renormalizable level so far discussed, one
linear combination of these states will necessarily remain massless (due to a lack of a partner with the
opposite chirality) and may only obtain its mass via the introduction of Majorana mass terms or, more
generally, via the introduction of higher dimensional operators; these possibilities will warrant further
study elsewhere. The only other SM neutral fields that we have seen above are the chiral doublet and
triplet fields, D, T , for which we would need to produce Majorana mass terms and that were introduced
simply to cancel the gauge/gravity anomalies. Such states are not likely to be present in a top-down
14 For simplicity in the discussion that follows, we will consider only the simpler situation of a single set of exotic fermions
that mix/couple to only one of the SM generations but the discussion can be directly generalized.

29

approach or in the next step up the ladder to a more UV-complete theory where such cancellations are
generally more subtle.
The implications of these considerations in the bottom-up approach are that we need to introduce a
further new neutral, SM singlet state to play the role of DM without upsetting either the anomaly cancellation conditions or the requirements associated with the finiteness of the  parameter. One tempting
choice is to add to the fermion spectrum a new vector-like, SM singlet, S3 , with a mass M3 which (we
assume to be somewhat fine-tuned) which is of order ∼ O(1 GeV), but which is also an SU (2)I singlet
and carries a dark charge QD (S3 ) = −QD (S1 ) = 1 = YI 0 since such a state also has T3I = 0. Given the
set of Higgs fields Hi above, S3 will not mix with any of the other neutral fields that we already have
introduced (at the renormalizable level) and hence it has will have no obvious decay paths allowing it to
be stable. Such states can arise naturally, or at least in a less ad hoc fashion, at the next step towards a
more UV-complete model [19].
The state S3 , by virtue of having a non-zero QI charge, will couple to the ZI in addition to AI . Since
the ZI is much more massive than the DM, with mZI ' 5 TeV, it will be a subleading contribution to
DM-electron scattering. At high temperatures in the early universe, the ZI interaction may help bring
the DM into thermal equilibrium with the SM, ZI mediated reactions will freeze-out long before AI
mediated reactions, so the latter will control the relic density. However, it is well known that scenarios
with light Dirac fermion states with mass less than a few GeV are constrained by measurements of
the CMB power spectrum [50]. These constraints arise from DM annihilating via s-wave processes into
SM electromagnetic final states (e.g., e+ e− ) so that light S3 states annihilating via dark photons are
excluded [51, 52], as the annihilation cross section is guaranteed to be s-wave, either proceeding through
s-channel AI exchange for mS3 < mAI or through the t-channel process S3 S3 → AI AI for mS3 > mAI .
One alternative to these vector-like fermionic DM states is that a (purely) dark Higgs plays the role
of dark matter. In the simplest scenario a complex scalar φ with mass mφ ∼ O(1 GeV) < mAI , charged
only under U (1)I so that its interaction with the SM is mediated only by AI and ZI , will have p-wave
annihilations into SM electromagnetic final states, thus avoiding the stringent CMB constraints. We note
that mφ < mAI is required for the annihilation cross section to be p-wave suppressed, as the process
φφ → AI AI is s-wave, and would dominate for mφ > mAI .
While several physical scalar states remain after the symmetry breaking, as described at the end of
Section 3.2, none fit the requirements of a stable, light, complex scalar thermal relic with interactions
primarily mediated by AI . The three physical charged states obviously cannot be dark matter, and in
the neutral sector we do not have the proper degrees of freedom to form a light U (1)D charged scalar
which only interacts via the dark gauge bosons AI and ZI . Three of the four electrically neutral states
(†)
which carry U (1)D charge in the gauge eigenbasis, h01,4 and a01,4 , are likely eaten by the AI and WI ,
so that the remaining physical neutral states only have a single real CP-even U (1)D charged component.
(†)
Indeed, since it is likely that WI eats a goldstone which is predominantly h4 , the remaining state would
likely have an appreciable interaction with the SM Z as well. In any event, this state cannot be combined
with the presumably U (1)D neutral CP-odd field which remains after the symmetry breaking to form a
complex scalar with QD = 1, so we see that the scalar DM described above must lie outside of the scalar
field content proposed in Section 3.1 to provide appropriate fermion masses.
One may well ask how the conventional DM physics associated with the canonical KM scenario, where
DM-SM interactions are mediated by the exchange of a dark photon with purely vectorial couplings alone,
is altered by the additional structure introduced above. In particular, we have in mind the calculation of
the thermal relic cross section and the DM-electron scattering cross section, σe , as relevant for DM direct
detection in this mass range ∼ 1 GeV. From the above discussions we know that this simple interaction
picture is modified not only by the new interactions introduced by the additional gauge bosons and
their mixing with the corresponding SM fields but also by the mass mixing of the portal fields and the
corresponding SM partners. While some of these effects will influence all of the SM fermions, other
possible effects will, of course, be influenced by which SM generation mixes with the new exotic fields. It
is interesting to note that the coupling of a single set of exotic fields to a specific SM generation would
produce non-universal couplings which might be explored in flavor experiments, but a study of such effects
is beyond the scope of this work. The case considered in Section 3.3 dealt with a single exotic generation,

30

but in principle there may be several exotic generations as was briefly discussed above. In this case there
would be a rather more complex mass mixing structure, but the overall effect would remain roughly of
the same order of magnitude. Certainly, if the single set of exotics couple only to the second or third
generation, the influence of all the new portal matter fields on σe , will be completely absent at tree-level.
Fortunately, more generally, since both DM annihilation and electron scattering are dominated by the
DM-DP ∼ GeV mass scales, or below, they are generally protected from much of this new physics, even
when the exotics mix with the first SM generation, which is generally seen to decouple as is certainly the
case with the new gauge interactions. For example, the influence of ZI exchange is clearly inconsequential
since its mass is likely (at least) several TeV, making a relative contribution to the amplitudes of both
processes which is at most ∼ 10−3 . The contributions of the W, WI gauge bosons are corresponding either
mass mixing, mass ratio or loop suppressed or some combination of these. However, due to the Z − AI
mixing discussed above, and the canonical kinetic mixing, all SM fields will experience a coupling to the
DP given by the combination eQ − σ cgw (T3L − s2w Q) where σ = (ggI sI )(v1 /mZ )2 /(2cw ) ∼  as previously
defined; note that σ have either sign relative to . This Z − AI mixing term induced a parity-violating
interaction between all the SM fermions and the DP. On top of this general effect, the mass mixing of,
e.g., the first generation SM fermions with the exotics can produce some additional non-trivial effects. As
was discussed above and in I, e − E mixing induces a new contribution to the AI coupling which is purely
left-handed and whose (relative) magnitude is controlled by the parameter ratio y ' −eI (v4 /v3 )2 /(e),
which may also have either sign. Thus for electrons, explicitly, one finds the DP coupling to be
e ēγµ (vl − al γ5 )eAµI ,

(46)

(− 12 + 2s2w ) and al = − y2 + 4cσg
, respectively. The first term in the vector
where vl = −1 − y2 − 2cσg
w e
w e
coupling is the canonical one from KM, the second term arises from the AI − Z mass mixing induced by
the light vev of the bidoublet H2 , and the final term is induced by the e − E mass mixing due to the light
vev of the SU (2)I doublet H3 . (This last term will, of course, be absent, i.e., y → 0, if the exotics mix
with the second or third generation SM fermions.) DM scattering off of electrons will be then be modified
by an overall factor of vl2 + a2l relative to the canonical KM result. For DM pair annihilating into e+ e− ,
since we are far above threshold there is also an identical rescaling factor. However, if the exotics mix
with the second SM generation, near but above the µ+ µ− threshold, the impact is a bit more complex
with a rescaling of the canonical result for this final state by a factor of vl2 + 2β 2 a2l /(3 − β 2 ), where to
lowest order in the velocity expansion β 2 = 1 − (mµ /mDM )2 . Once above the hadronic threshold, the
existence of both vl , al 6= 0 will re-weight the usual annihilation cross sections in a complex manner as
various specific particle thresholds are crossed but these effects will remain O(1).

Discussion and Conclusions

The dark photon as a mediator between the dark sector and the SM makes a compelling scenario for
extending the WIMP idea to smaller DM masses. However, the generation of the necessary kinetic
mixing at 1-loop requires the existence of new states, portal matter, which are charged under both the
SM and the dark U (1)D gauge group. In order to satisfy anomaly freedom, constraints from precision
Higgs/electroweak data as well as those on particle lifetimes from nucleosynthesis, these portal matter
states must be vector-like (with respect to the SM gauge symmetries) copies of (at least some of) the SM
fermions. Furthermore, if the strength of the kinetic mixing is a finite quantity, as might be expected in
a UV-framework, then the various couplings of the portal matter states must be in some way correlated
with one another as might be expected within a non-abelian group structure.
In this work we take a bottom-up approach to building a theory of the portal matter necessary for 1loop kinetic mixing, beginning with fermionic matter inspired by E6 , but we augment the SU (5)×SU (2)I
subgroup of E6 by an additional U (1)I , which kinetically mixes with the SM hypercharge. This allows us
to avoid a scenario where the SM fermions are charged under the eventual U (1)D group, as they would be
if we identified U (1)D as a subgroup of SU (2)I . The SU (2)I × U (1)I breaks to U (1)D at a scale of several
(†)
TeV, leading to the generation of masses for the gauge bosons ZI and WI as well as the exotic fermions
at the TeV scale. This TeV scale symmetry breaking can be probed at the LHC, primarily through the
31

(†)

production of ZI , WI , or the down-like quark partner h, and the absence of such signals to date allows
us to place some constraints on the strength of the dark coupling constants and s2I , the analog of the
weak mixing angle associated with the SU (2)I × U (1)I → U (1)D breaking pattern. The exotic and SM
fermions are both charged under U (1)I , so that both contribute to the kinetic mixing parameter . The
relatively degenerate masses of the exotic fermions at the TeV scale and the SM fermions at the GeV
E
scale allow the contributions to  to be suppressed, so that the leading contributions go like log( m
mh ) and
me
log( m
). This cancellation generically gives  ∼ 10−(3−4) , an interesting portion of parameter space for
d
dark matter.
The gauge charges of the exotic fermions impose requirements on the Higgs sector of the model, both
to generate their TeV scale masses and to ensure mass mixings with SM fermions that allow them to
decay promptly. Three scales emerge from the pattern of vevs required to give the fermionic content
of the theory appropriate masses while producing a GeV scale dark photon: the few -10 TeV scale vev
v3 , responsible for the SU (2)I × U (1)I → U (1)D breaking and exotic fermion masses, the weak scale
vevs v, v2 responsible for the EWSB of the SM and the SM fermion masses, and the GeV scale vevs
v1 , v4 which are responsible for breaking U (1)D as well as generating mass mixings which allow exotic
fermion decay. Interestingly, since the light vevs lie in the SU (2)I doublet and the SU (2)L × SU (2)I
bidoublet, this symmetry breaking patter creates a non-standard phenomenology of the dark photon AI ,
which now acquires a new coupling to the SM through mass mixing with the Z and a new SM-exotic
coupling through mass mixing with the hermitian combination WI + WI† . These mixing effects produce
parity-violating couplings to the AI in addition to the traditional vector eQ coupling. The additional
Z-like coupling modifies cross sections in direct detection experiments, and the SM-exotic coupling can
produce a rich collider phenomenology, for instance allowing pair production of hh̄ through t-channel
AI exchange, which is explored in Section 4. The mass mixing between exotic fermions and their SM
counterparts can also induce new diagonal couplings to AI , though these are subdominant and enter at
order 2 . For general SM-VLF mixings, FCNCs can yield some important constraints on the details of
the model structure.
The extensive exotic field content of this model, and its original E6 inspiration, beg the question of a
top-down unified theory approach, which is the topic of a future work. The construction of such a model
clearly requires a unifying group larger than E6 , and the vector-like dark fermionic states S1,2,3 hint at a
unification of SU (2)I × U (1)I → SU (3)I in a GUT context. Furthermore, the GUT symmetry breaking
pattern may yield a more predictive phenomenology by fixing the relative coupling strengths and mixing
angles which were treated as free parameters above. This further work should also seek to provide a more
compelling dark matter candidate, as there are quite tight constraints for DM coupling to a kinetically
mixed dark photon in the GeV mass range.
In summary, we have analyzed the implications of fermionic portal matter inspired by the exotic
content of E6 /SU (2)I -based models, which gives rise to a kinetic mixing between a massive dark photon
AI and the SM photon. Requiring that the exotic fermions have TeV scale masses and decay into SM
particles implies a Higgs and gauge sector which has many non-standard couplings outlined in Section 3,
and a rich phenomenology which may be explored in low-energy experiments and at colliders as detailed
in Section 4. The question of thermal dark matter and the implications of the non-standard couplings of
the dark photon for direct detection experiments are summarized in Section 5, and a further exploration
of a unified theory approach is reserved for future work.
