Abstract – This review considers a problem in the
development of mobile robot adhesion methods with vertical
surfaces and the appropriate locomotion mechanism design.
The evolution of adhesion methods for wall-climbing robots
(based on friction, magnetic forces, air pressure, electrostatic
adhesion, molecular forces, rheological properties of fluids
and their combinations) and their locomotion principles
(wheeled, tracked, walking, sliding framed and hybrid) is
studied. Wall-climbing robots are classified according to the
applications, adhesion methods and locomotion mechanisms.
The advantages and disadvantages of various adhesion
methods and locomotion mechanisms are analyzed in terms
of mobility, noiselessness, autonomy and energy efficiency.
Focus is placed on the physical and technical aspects of the
adhesion methods and the possibility of combining adhesion
and locomotion methods.

38-46]. The third group of tasks for WCRs is in the field
of security, where the WCRs provide assistance to military
police and special services [5, 8, 10, 25, 34, 37, 42, 47-50].

ADHESION METHODS

The adhesion methods determine the WCR’s ability to
effectively attach, hold and detach from a surface. The
currently existing adhesion methods can be divided into
groups according to the nature of the adhesion force
(Fig. 1). The adhesion methods can also be divided into
active and passive depending on whether energy is
expended in creating a holding force.

INTRODUCTION

The development of wall-climbing robots (WCR) is one
of the challenging issues of modern robotics. The first
WCRs appeared in the mid-1960s [1]; in the 1990s,
research and development on WCR methods and
mechanisms began to extensively progress, and by 2005,
there were more than 200 experimental models and
prototypes [2]. In the 2000s, with magnetic and vacuum
adhesion, new methods of adhesion were developed,
which led to an increase in scientific research and
publications in this direction [3-16]. However, at present,
there is no universal robot that satisfies the operational
conditions in various environments and on all surfaces.
The main reason is the features of adhesion methods and
locomotion mechanisms for climbing, which are analyzed
in this paper.
The general idea of the robot assignment is to solve
tasks that are expensive, potentially dangerous, or difficult
to accomplish, including for environmental reasons.
WCRs created to address problems of nondestructive
inspection of construction, industrial and technical
facilities [8, 10, 13, 16-37] are the most widespread. The
second group of tasks solved using WCRs includes
cleaning or painting objects that are difficult to access or

Figure 1. Classification of adhesion methods according to the nature of
the adhesion force

A. Friction-based adhesion
This type of adhesion is realized in WCRs using
mechanical elements (claws, hooks, spikes) that are
embedded in deformable surfaces or cling to the
roughnesses on uneven surfaces [3, 4, 10, 12, 26, 27, 35,
48, 49, 51-54]. The mechanical element scale varies in the
range of 1-100 µm depending on the operating surface
type and quality. The nature of the WCR interaction with
the operating surface, which accounts for the locomotion
mechanism, determines the number of mechanical
elements and their design, material and shape, which are
best suited for moving along vertical surfaces.

B. Magnetic adhesion
This adhesion method is used when a WCR moves
along ferromagnetic surfaces or structures with large
ferromagnetic elements (such as reinforced concrete
structures). It provides a high robot maneuverability and
larger holding force than other adhesion methods.
Magnetic adhesion can be provided in an active or passive
manner. In the first case, electromagnets are used [3, 4, 6,
8-10, 28, 55-57]; in the second case, permanent magnets
are used [3, 4, 6, 8-10, 14, 20, 22, 24, 29-31, 36, 58, 59].
C. Adhesion methods based on air pressure
Adhesion methods based on air pressure include
vacuum adhesion, Bernoulli’s principle-based adhesion,
vortex effect (Ranque-Hilsch effect) adhesion and
aerodynamic pressure. These methods are only realizable
in the atmosphere and are nonusable in space.
Vacuum adhesion mechanisms are some of the most
usable mechanisms in WCRs. The holding force in this
case can be passively or actively formed.
Passive vacuum adhesion does not require energy for
the holding force formation and is realized with suction
cups [3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 16, 60-65]. In this case, it is necessary
to provide a preload to press the suction cups to the surface
and an additional force for their separation. Both
mechanisms should be provided by the design of a
locomotion mechanism [62].
Active vacuum adhesion [3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 13, 16, 18, 23,
37-40, 42, 66-69] is provided by external or internal (onboard) vacuum generators. In [42], a WCR prototype
attached with four suction cups to a vertical surface is
considered. The vacuum in the cups is formed with a liquid
vacuum pump that operates on the Venturi effect. The
operating medium (water, air), whose kinetic energy is
used to provide a holding force, can also be directly used
to solve tasks by robots such as window cleaning.
Bernoulli’s principle is widely used in industrial robots
for the contactless gripper operation, but using this
principle to hold the robot on a vertical surface is a slightly
new phenomenon. The WCR blows air to the wall surface;
as a result, the greater external pressure holds it on the wall
[70]. The experimental model in [70] can move in any
direction and overcome small obstacles such as joints
between tiles on a wall or cracks in a tree. Its payload
capacity is 0.5 kg with an own weight of 0.234 kg.
The robot can be held on a vertical surface with the
vortex effect (Ranque-Hilsch effect) [4, 16, 19, 32, 47, 71,
72]. Similar to the previous mechanism, this principle is
used in contactless grippers in industrial robotics. One
method to provide a vortex effect is mechanical: an
impeller connected to the drive is installed in the closed
cavity of the vacuum (suction) chamber. When the
impeller is retwisted in the central part of the suction
chamber, an area with reduced pressure is formed and
makes the robot hold on the surface. Low-powerconsumption engines are sufficient to rotate the impeller
for a given WCR energy efficiency. The negative pressure
inside the suction chamber can be controlled by changing
the rotation speed of the impeller. The payload capacity of
WCRs that operate on this effect is relatively high: for

example, in the prototype [72], it is 0.5 kg, and the weight
of the robot is 0.12 kg.
WCRs that operate based on aerodynamic pressure are
held on a vertical surface by the pressure force formed by
rotating propellers [21, 33, 43, 73]. In these WCRs with an
active locomotion mechanism, the propellers act as an
adhesion mechanism and a source of driving force to move
the robot along the surface.
D. Electrostatic adhesion method
This adhesion method is based on an electrostatic force
created by high voltage (0.5-5 kV), which is applied to a
flexible electrode panel [4, 12, 34, 74-79]. The panel
consists of at least two sets of independent electrodes with
different potentials; the electrodes are deposited on one
polymer film and coated with another polymer film to
provide electrical insulation. When alternating positive
and negative charges are induced at the adjacent
electrodes, the electric fields create opposite charges on the
wall surface. Thus, they cause electrostatic adhesion
between the electrode panel and the wall surface. The
strength of adhesion directly depends on the electrode
panel area, its materials and the magnitude of the applied
voltage [78].
WCRs that operate on the electrostatic adhesion have
low weight and small dimensions due to the simple
adhesion mechanism construction and require low power
consumption in the resting state. For example, an electrode
panel with a 40-cm2 area requires 0.25-mW of power at
currents of 10-20 nA per N of weight [79]. The dynamic
properties of the WCRs with electrostatic adhesion are
currently unsatisfactory. First, the turning movement is
difficult for such robots, since it causes a dynamic change
of the electric field and a decrease in the holding
electrostatic force [75]. Second, the maximum movement
speed is limited to the effect of charge relaxation [76].
E. Adhesion based on molecular forces
These adhesion methods are most widely realized in
“dry” adhesion, but there is also a “wet” adhesion.
Dry adhesion is realized by having materials interacting
at the molecular level with the operating surface, such as
synthetic elastomers or materials with micro- or
nanostructure arrays.
The adhesion of polymers with microstructures
simulates the morphology of a gecko’s paws, which have
a huge number of micro- and nanohairs that adhere to the
supporting surface due to van der Waals forces [80, 81].
This principle of a holding force formation is realized in
WCR using materials that contain arrays of
microstructures [4, 8, 10, 12, 82-89]. The shape, size,
material, and location of microfibers in these arrays
determine the adhesion rate [88, 89]. In addition, WCRs
using polymers with microfibers are being actively
investigated for space applications [82, 84].
Elastomeric adhesion (synthetic “dry” adhesion) [4, 8,
10, 12, 14, 25, 41, 81, 89, 90] can be a substitute for
complex and expensive polymers with microstructures. In
this case, simpler and cheaper adhesive materials with
small elasticity moduli are used, and the adhesive force is
proportional to the area of the elastomer contact surface.

Adhesion in the wet state has been performed in
experimental WCR models [91-93]. These WCRs use
adhesives in the liquid state to adhere to the operating
surface. These materials serve as an interlayer between the
surface and the contact pad of the robot. Pressure-sensitive
adhesives (passive adhesion) [91] and thermoplastic
adhesives (active adhesion) can be used. In the second
case, the robot requires a heating element to adhere to the
surface. It can be a built-in automatic hot melt device that
dispenses glue to the surface [92] or a heating element
embedded in a robot contact pad made of thermoplastic
glue with a cooling element [93].
For mini robots (characteristic size < 100 mm), a
“reverse” version of adhesion in the wet state with the use
of glue has been proposed: the adhesive is applied in
advance on the operating surface, upon which the robot
then climbs [94]. Studies have shown that with similar
scales of robots, this approach provides efficient
movement on vertical surfaces.
F. Adhesion based on the rheological properties of a
fluid
Although these methods are used to form a holding
force, they have not found a wide range of application. For
example, the snail robot with an original locomotion
mechanism [95] uses a non-Newtonian fluid, whose
characteristics are similar to snail slime, to move along
walls and ceilings. Another example is the
magnetorheological fluid application for WCR adhesion
with the surface [96], which enables the robot to move
along surfaces of different types.
G. Hybrid adhesion methods
These methods are a combination of two or more
described methods [50, 97, 98]. Hybrid adhesion methods
can improve the adhesion efficiency and adaptability of
WCRs to various types of surfaces.
III.

LOCOMOTION MECHANISMS

The locomotion mechanisms of WCRs are the technical
methods of implementing their movement. These
mechanisms can be divided into passive and active.
Passive mechanisms use a device that does not belong to
the WCR, such as a cable, rope or rail device [3, 6, 12, 15,
39, 43-46]. The movement of such robots is provided by
roof cables, winches and other devices that provide their
movement. Such mechanisms are commonly used to move
large and heavy robots that can carry a large payload.
However, the WCRs that move in such manners are not
autonomous and maneuverable and have a relatively low
speed of movement, so they are not considered later in the
article.
The active locomotion mechanisms of WCRs can be
divided into six groups: wheeled, tracked, walking, sliding
framed, hybrid and specific, which cannot be attributed to
any of the previous groups. For example, the last group
includes robots that imitate the movement of a snail [95]
or a caterpillar [65, 69, 79] or a jumping robot [54].
The wheeled locomotion mechanism is one of the most
common for WCRs [3-5, 8-10, 12, 13, 16, 19-21, 24, 30,

51, 57, 58, 70, 71, 91]. Еach link of a wheeled robot has
several wheels driven by engines. The maneuverability of
wheeled robots can be provided by differential drives or
omnidirectional wheels. Based on the number of wheels,
these locomotion mechanisms can be divided into two-,
three-, four-, six- and multi-wheeled (with more than eight
wheels) drives. Wheeled WCRs are used on surfaces with
medium roughness to avoid slipping. However, there is
another solution: to select the wheel material depending on
the type of surface. In [70], the robot easily (using a single
screw) mounts the necessary wheels for the conditions of
a specific task. Compared to other locomotion
mechanisms, wheeled WCRs have good mobility, a simple
drive mechanism (usually electric) and the ability to
achieve high speeds with low power consumption.
However, they have limitations when they must overcome
obstacles with a sharp height drop, which exceeds one
third of the wheel diameter.
The tracked locomotion mechanism is also widely used
in WCRs [3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 14, 22, 29, 36, 61, 62, 65-67,
72, 75-77, 79, 83, 85, 97]. These robots move by tracks
that are driven by drive mechanisms. Tracked WCRs have
good and continuous contact with the operating surface.
This mechanism provides them with good friction and
driving force to resist slip and enables them to move along
uneven and soft surfaces and overcome obstacles; they
have an advantage in speed of movement compared to the
walking and sliding framed mechanisms and can
accommodate large payloads. However, they consume
more energy, reach lower speeds and are less
maneuverable than the wheeled robots.
The walking locomotion mechanism [3-5, 8, 10, 12, 16,
18, 28, 34, 35, 38, 48, 49, 52, 53, 55, 63, 64, 68, 86, 92, 93,
96] has analogs in nature by design and kinematics and
simulates the gait of living beings. Based on the number of
walking links (“legs”), such WCRs can be divided into
two-, four-, five-, six- and multilegged types. The high
mobility of the walking links is the advantage of walking
robots, which enables them to move on uneven surfaces
with high obstacles and in unstructured environments.
However, due to the intermittent movement, such robots
have relatively low movement speeds, consume large
amounts of energy, are difficult to control in terms of gait,
and do not have good reliability and stability when moving
along a vertical surface.
The sliding framed locomotion mechanisms [3-5, 9, 10,
12, 14, 16, 23, 27, 39-42, 74] consist of two moving parts,
which translationally or rotationally move relative to each
other. This mechanism is simple in operation and control
compared to the locomotion mechanisms of other WCRs
and can provide a large step size. However, despite its
simplicity, its disadvantages are the large size of the body
(frame), which does not enable movement in confined
spaces, low speed, low ability to overcome obstacles and
difficulties in maneuvering.
Hybrid locomotion mechanisms are combinations of
several of the above mechanisms [4, 12, 37, 50, 56]. Such
combinations combine the features of the mechanisms to
increase the speed of movement and the possibility of

or consist of adhesive “feet” [25, 82]. Such combinations
of two mechanisms simplify the design of the mobile
robots, reduce the size and weight, improve the control
quality and reduce the power consumption.
Table 1 summarizes the applicability and compatibility
of adhesion methods with locomotion mechanisms, which
are collected from the existing prototypes and
experimental samples of WCRs.

parameters of WCRs for various adhesion methods.

overcoming obstacles, but they complicate the WCR
design and control.

COMBINATIONS OF LOCOMOTION MECHANISMS
AND ADHESION METHODS

In many cases, the locomotion mechanism of the WCR
is combined with the adhesion method. For example,
suction pads [60-62, 66, 67] or permanent magnets [14, 29]
can be placed on the robot track; electrodes for
electrostatic adhesion formation can be the track itself [7477, 97]. In wheeled WCRs, the wheels can be magnetic
[20, 56, 58, 59], have mechanical elements (spikes) [51],

Most WCRs constructively consist of one link (body)
and include an adhesion mechanism and a locomotion
mechanism, which realizes the necessary and sufficient
movement of the robot to solve a specific task.
However, the WCRs must have great mobility,
maneuverability, and ability to overcome the transitions
between vertical and horizontal surfaces through internal
or external angles of different sizes, overcome obstacles
and move on arbitrarily oriented surfaces when the WCRs
are designed to move on complex surfaces, which are
arbitrarily oriented in space. For this purpose, two- [14, 17,
36, 71, 79, 85], three- [14, 58, 66] and multilink [5, 14]
WCRs are used.

Based on these features, hybrid adhesion methods should
be developed to address a number of practical problems.

CONCLUSION

The analysis of the methods and mechanisms of robot
movements demonstrates a great variety in applied
adhesion methods, which enable robots to be held on
vertical surfaces, and locomotion mechanisms, which
provide their movement along operating surfaces. Each of
the considered methods and mechanisms has advantages
and limitations in application, which makes it impossible
to create a universal wall-climbing platform that is equally
well suited for solving various tasks in different
conditions. The tendency of bionic and hybrid method
development has emerged in recent years in the WCR
design process.
At the current stage of development of WCRs, the
following problems can be identified, the solution of
which will enable significant advances. Most adhesion
methods do not enable the implementation of an
autonomous robot, even fewer methods enable the
possibility of passive adhesion, which does not require a
specially organized external energy supply. In the scope of
a single adhesion method, it appears impossible to develop
a robot that can move across a wide range of surface types.
