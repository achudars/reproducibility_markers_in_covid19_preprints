Abstract
We introduce a new method for computing spectra of molecules for which a spin-spin term in
the Hamiltonian has an important effect. In previous calculations, matrix elements of the spin-spin
term and of the potential were obtained by expanding the potential and using analytic equations in
terms of 3 − j symbols. Instead, we use quadrature. Quadrature is simple and makes it possible to
do calculations with a general potential and without using the Wigner-Eckart theorem. In previous
calculations, the Hamiltonian matrix was built and diagonalized. Instead, we use an iterative
eigensolver. It makes it easy to work with a large basis. The ideas are tested by computing energy
3 −
levels of NH(3 Σ− )-He, O2 (3 Σ−
g )-Ar and O2 ( Σg )-He.

INTRODUCTION

Multi-dimensional quadrature makes it possible to compute the ro-vibrational spectrum
of a molecule, even when the potential energy surface (PES) does not have a special form that
facilitates calculating integrals. Individual matrix elements could themselves be computed by
using multi-dimensional quadrature, however, by using an iterative eigensolver in conjunction
with multi-dimensional quadrature, spectra can be computed without calculating potential
matrix elements. [1–9] It is only necessary to evaluate matrix-vector products (MVPs). A
MVP transforms an input vector into an output vector. The output vector can be obtained
by doing sums sequentially. This sequential summation procedure has important advantages:
1) it can be used regardless of the functional form of the PES; 2) the cost of calculating MVPs
scales as it would if the PES were a sum of products (SOP), i.e., it is not more expensive
to use a general PES than a SOP PES (and is less expensive unless the SOP has very few
terms ); 3) there is no need to derive and use closed-form equations for complicated integrals.
MVPs are evaluated efficiently by exploiting product structure imposed by using a basis of
products of 1-D functions and a product quadrature grid.
In this paper, we show that a quadrature method for computing the ro-vibrational spectrum of a molecule for which interaction between rotational angular momenta and electronic
spin angular momentum is important has the same advantages. We are not the first to
include this interaction in a variational calculation. [10–12] Several effective fitting Hamiltonians that include such interactions have been derived and used. [13–17] In previous
variational calculations, elements of a Hamiltonian matrix were computed using closed-form
expressions and a Hamiltonian matrix was stored and diagonalized with a direct (not iterative) algorithm, whose cost scales as N 3 , where N is the size of the matrix. To do this
one relies on a special representation of the PES in terms of Legendre polynomials and uses
formulae involving 3−j symbols and reduced matrix elements to calculate matrix elements
of both the PES and the spin interaction term. The method we present works with general
PESs. We obviate the need for 3-j symbols and concerns about phase conventions etc. by
computing matrix elements of the spin interaction term and the PES with quadrature. All
MVPs are done by evaluating sums sequentially. In this paper, we propose equations for a
complex with three atoms AB-R; AB is a diatomic molecule in a 3 Σ electronic state with

2

electron spin S = 1 and R is a closed-shell atom with zero spin. Everything is done using a body-fixed basis that is advantageous when the anisotropy of the PES is strong. We
test our equations by computing energy levels for O2 -Ar, O2 -He and NH-He. Tennyson and
co-workers were the first to do calculations on O2 -Ar, O2 -He. [10, 11] Van der Avoird and
Brocks[18] have done calculations for O2 dimer.

II.

VIBRATION-ROTATION-SPIN KINETIC ENERGY OPERATOR

To derive the correct kinetic energy operator (KEO), it is best to begin with the dimerfixed (DF) frame KEO for a complex composed of two monomers which we denote A and B.
The DF frame is a two-angle body-fixed (BF) frame. It is obtained by rotating a space-fixed
(SF) frame by two Euler angles (α, β) so that the DF frame z-axis is aligned with r0 , the
vector connecting the centers of mass of A and B. See Fig. 1a. As shown by Brocks et al.[19],
the DF KEO is
T DF = T A + T B + Tint

where B0 (0) = 1/(2µr0 r02 ). µ0 is the reduced mass. J is the total angular momentum. j is
the sum of the angular momenta of the two monomers. T A and T B are KEOs for monomers
A and B in the DF frame. Components of J and j are in the DF frame. The components
of J have a special form and are written in terms of α, β and jz (See Eq. (20) of Brocks et
al.[19]).
In this paper, we consider systems in which monomer A is a diatomic molecule in a 3 Σ−
g
electronic state with electron spin S = 1 and monomer B is an atom. The total angular
momentum of monomer A is
j = N1 + S ,

(2)

where N1 is the rotational angular momentum associated with r1 , the diatomic vector. See
Fig. 1a. N1 is usually called l1 , if there is no spin. In the DF frame, the spherical polar
angles for vector r1 are (θ1 , γ) ( γ is used for the azimuthal angle to be consistent with the
standard three-angle BF frame whose orientation in the SF frame is specified by three Euler
3

angles (α, β, γ)). The expressions for N1 operators in terms of (θ1 , γ) are standard, see e.g.
Eq. (1.36) of Ref. 20. The spin-rovibrational KEO for monomer A is[21]

Tfine = λ0 (3Sζ2 − S 2 ) + γ0 N1 · S ,

where Sζ is the projection of S along the diatomic vector. T B = 0 because B is an atom.
Substituting Eq. (2) and Eq. (3) into Eq. (1), we obtain

In this paper, the diatomic is rigid and therefore the second term in Eq. (6) is removed. In
summary, to derive the KEO that includes coupling between spin and rotation, one replaces
j in Tint with N1 + S, but uses N1 and not N1 + S in T A . Tfine also couples spin and
rotation.

III.

BASIS AND MATRIX ELEMENTS

Knowing the KEO and having a potential, we calculate vibration-rotation-spin energy
levels by choosing a basis and evaluating matrix-vector products (MVPs) to use the Lanczos
algorithm. When spin effects are omitted this is a common procedure. [2, 6, 23, 24, 26]
When the Lanczos vectors are not orthogonalized, the memory and CPU costs are low. To
calculate wavefunctions we repeat the Lanczos iteration.[25–27] The vibration-rotation-spin
basis is a direct product of a stretch basis and a bend-rotation-spin basis. The stretch basis
functions are discrete variable representation (DVR) functions. [2] In the rest of the section,
we discuss only the bend-rotation-spin basis. Each bend-rotation-spin basis function is a
product,

with K ≡ mN1 + mS . mN1 , mS , and K are projection quantum numbers, along the dimerfixed (DF) z-axis, of the rotational angular momentum N1 , the electronic spin S, and the
total angular momentum J . Note that for a triatomic molecule with no spin, we normally
use |l1 m1 i instead of |N1 mN1 i for the angular basis associated with r1 . In this paper, we
choose to use |N1 mN1 i because we include the electronic spin angular momentum for the
diatomic. The basis of Eq. (7) can be written in terms of a standard symmetric top Wigner
function,
|N1 mN1 ; JKM; SmS i =

(8)

because K ≡ mN1 + mS . If S = 0, Eq. (8) is the standard triatomic vibration-rotation basis.
[28]
Tennyson and Mettes[10] did the first variational calculation for O2 -Ar. They used the SF
frame basis, |((NS)jL)JMJ i, in the notation of Ref. 10, with MJ the SF Z-axis projection
of total J. Their basis was built by successively coupling pairs of angular momenta with
Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. In our notation, this basis would be |((N1 S)jl0 )JMi. A notable
difference between their basis and our BF basis, Eq. (7), is that the BF basis does not have
the l0 quantum number because the z-axis of the BF frame is along r0 . The BF basis also
does not have the j label. It does have projection quantum numbers along the BF z-axis.
To analytically evaluate potential integrals in their SF basis, Tennyson and Mettes expand
the potential in terms of Legendre polynomials. In the SF basis, equations for the matrix
elements of Tfine are known in terms of 3-j and 6-j symbols[21]. They are derived with the
Wigner-Eckart theorem.
We are not the first to propose using the BF basis of Eq. (7). Van der Avoird used it
in Ref. 12, with perturbation theory, to explain the variational results of Tennyson and
Mettes[10]. Using the BF projection quantum numbers K and mN1 , Van der Avoird identified ladder patterns in the variational levels. Using the Wigner-Eckart theorem[21], he
derived analytic expressions for matrix elements of Tfine in the BF basis. These expressions
involve a 3-j symbol and double-bar reduced matrix elements. In section IV, we will propose a new method for calculating matrix elements of Tfine in the BF basis. Van der Avoird
and Brocks[18] use a BF basis to variationally compute fine-structure levels of O2 dimer, a
problem more challenging than the triatomic in this paper.

As mentioned above, operators for the components of J in the DF frame have a special
form. Nonetheless, if mN1 in Eq. (8) is equal to K − mS , one obtains
ĵz |N1 mN1 ; JKM; SmS i = (N̂1z + Ŝz )|N1 mN1 ; JKM; SmS i
= (mN1 + mS )|N1 mN1 ; JKM; SmS i
= K|N1 mN1 ; JKM; SmS i .

(9)

Because of this equation, the matrix elements of J operators in the DF frame can be obtained
from the usual standard equations, as in the case of systems with no spin.[29] J 2 −cot β∂/∂β
is diagonal and its non-zero elements are J(J + 1). Matrix elements of J± are also equal to
the usual expressions. [20] The constraint K = mN1 + mS has a physical interpretation. As
we see from Fig. 1a, the constraint arises because J = l0 + N1 + S and l0 has no projection
on the z-axis of the DF frame.
Non-zero diagonal KEO matrix elements, in the basis of Eq. (7), for all terms except the
Sζ2 term, which we shall focus on later in the paper, are:
hN1 mN1 ; JKM; SmS |T DF |N1 mN1 ; JKM; SmS i

where the last two terms are from Tfine . KEO terms that are off-diagonal are N1 · J , S · J ,
and N1 · S from Tint and N1 · S from Tfine . Their matrix elements are computed from the

Parity-adapted basis

We prefer to work with a parity-adapted uncoupled basis which has the advantage of being
two times smaller. The parity-adapted basis functions are equal to or linear combinations of
the uncoupled basis functions,

with
NKmS = (1 + δK,0δmS ,0 )−1/2 ,
where P = 0 and 1 correspond to even and odd parity, respectively. The parity adapted
basis functions are obtained by considering,
E ∗ |N1 mN1 ; JKMi|SmS i = (−1)J+S |N1 m̄N1 ; J K̄Mi|S m̄S i ,
which is obtained from E ∗ |SmS i = (−1)S |S m̄S i (See Eq.

(14)

(A18) of Ref. 30) and

E ∗ |N1 mN1 ; JKMi = (−1)J |N1 m̄N1 ; J K̄Mi (See e.g. Eq. 10 of Ref. 31). Note that the
3

Σ− electronic wavefunction has odd parity. This factor is not included in Eq. (14) and not

included in our tables and figures. In this work, we label levels with their spectroscopic
parity e/f , which is (−1)J+P = ±1, respectively. For a single parity, the number of parityadapted functions is roughly half the number of non-parity-adapted basis functions. The

7

parity-adapted and non-parity-adapted bases span the same space if the quantum numbers
are restricted by
mS ≥ 0,
K ≥ 0 (if mS = 0) .

(15)

These restrictions complicate the evaluation of MVPs in the parity-adapted basis and we
therefore transform from the PA basis to the basis of Eq. (8), evaluate the MVP in that
basis, and then transform back to the PA basis. Recall that mN1 is determined by mS and
K and is not an independent basis label.
Van der Avoird also used a parity-adapted basis in Eq. 12 of Ref. 12. His notation (−1)p
is equivalent to our (−1)J+S+P in Eq. (13). This is confirmed by comparing the assignments
of our O2 -Ar levels, reported in section VIII, with those of Ref. 12.

IV.

MATRIX ELEMENTS OF THE SPIN INTERACTION TERM Sζ2

We use the basis of Eq. (8) because when the anisotropy of the PES is strong it is an
excellent basis. Unfortunately, it is not simple to apply the spin interaction term to one of
the basis functions. The problem is that the spin interaction term is written in terms of Sζ ,
the component of the spin operator along the diatomic axis, and the basis label mS is the
quantum number for the z component of the spin operator along the DF z axis which is
inter-monomer Jacobi vector. In order to calculate matrix elements of the spin interaction
term, we write each of the basis functions in terms of functions of a basis in which Sζ2 is
diagonal. The relation between these two spin bases is[20]

The integral in Eq. (17) is diagonal in M because the operator in the middle does not depend
on the Euler angle α. We now show that the integral in Eq. (17) is also diagonal in K. In
Eq. (17), the integral over γ is

because mN1 +mS = K. Without the factor eimS γ in Eq. (16), Eq. (17) would not be diagonal
in K. Owing to the diagonality in K, the integrand of the integral over β in Eq. (17) is a
product of two orthonormal functions, dJM,K (β)dJM,K (β) and is therefore unity. We can
therefore re-write Eq. (17) as,

where (wα1 , θα1 ) are Gauss-Legendre quadrature weights and points. N1 , mN1 and mS are
coupled by the spin term. The sum over α1 in Eq. (19) has almost the same form as a standard
quadrature approximation for a matrix element of a 1-D θ potential in an associated Legendre
basis. However in Eq. (19), Am′S mS ,α1 is off-diagonal in mS . For a particular (m′S , mS ) pair,
Am′S mS ,α1 is a sum of terms sinns θ cosnc θ, where nc + ns ≤ 2. Despite the fact that there are
terms with ns = 1, we use Gauss Legendre quadrature. It is nearly exact when the number of
points is chosen to be large enough to converge potential integrals. A matrix-vector product
with the Sζ2 matrix in Eq. (19) can be evaluated by doing sums sequentially,

where xN1 mN1 ,JK,SmS is a vector in the basis of Eq. (7). Because of the constraint, mN1 on
the input vector is not an independent label and is computed from mN1 = K − mS , and m′N1

on the output vector is not an independent label and is computed from m′N1 = K − m′S .

Rather than using Eq. (22), one could calculate the matrix elements on the left side of
Eq. (19), by doing the sum over α1 . After doing the sum over α1 , one would obtain the same
numbers that Van der Avoird gets using his analytic equation in terms of 3 − j symbols
and double bar reduced matrix elements. His equation shows that N1 is coupled only to
N1′ = N + ∆N1 with ∆N1 ≤ 2. The memory cost of storing the non-zero elements of
the Sζ2 matrix therefore scales as Nbas , where Nbas is the size of the basis. One could use

stored non-zero elements of the Sζ2 matrix to compute the matrix-vector product required
to use an iterative eigensolver. The cost of the MVP would then scale as Nbas . We prefer
to store the small A matrix of Eq. (20) and use sequential sums, as in Eq. (22), to compute
the matrix-vector product For our choice, the memory cost is smaller and the cost of the
matrix-vector product is similar. Not using analytic equations for matrix elements when it
is possible might seem less elegant, but quadrature reduces the memory cost and (not in
this case but in general) reduces the cost of evaluating MVPs. This is strikingly obvious
for potential MVPs. Quadrature is not approximate and does not increase the cost of the
calculations Moreover, the quadrature approach would also be straightforward even if Tf ine
involved complicated functions of Sζ operators and even if the angle between the ζ axis
and the BF z axis were a complicated function of the shape of the molecule. It also has
the advantage that one does not need to be careful about phase factor errors in analytical
expressions.

V.

ASSIGNMENT OF QUANTUM NUMBERS

J and P are conserved quantum numbers and we calculate levels with different values
separately. It is fairly straightforward to assign values of K, mS , mN1 , and N1 to every
energy level because the basis functions have these labels. To assign values of l0 and j0 is
harder because the basis functions do not have these labels. The assignments of projection
quantum numbers K, mS , mN1 are made with the approach of Ref. 9. For example, K
is assigned by summing the squares of expansion coefficients in the non-PA basis over all

10

indices other than K to obtain a quantity we call PK , which is a measure of the contribution
P
of basis functions labelled by K to the full wavefunction. ( K PK = 1.) PK and P−K are
equal and PmN1 and P−mN1 are equal. We therefore cannot assign the signs of K, mS , and

mN1 , however, using the relation, K = mN1 + mS , we can determine whether mS , and mN1
have the same or different signs. For O2 -Ar or O2 -He, this allows us to determine whether
the DF z projections for the rotation of O2 and the spin of O2 are aligned or anti-aligned.
We also assign l0 , j and N1 by computing expectation values of l02 , j 2 and N12 , denoted
by hl02 i, hj02 i, and hN12 i, respectively, for every state. These are useful approximate good

quantum numbers if coupling is weak. For example, the expectation value of N12 in state ψ i
is
hN12 i = hψ i |N12 |ψ i i

(24)

The coefficients, CNi 1 ,K,ms in the non-PA basis can be easily obtained from the coefficients in
the PA basis used to do the calculation. We use the non-PA basis because its off-diagonal
elements are easier to deal with (in the PA basis they are complicated due to the restrictions
on the quantum numbers in Eq. (15)). Computing hN12 i is easy because the basis functions

are labelled by N1 . Computing hl02 i and hj 2 i is not as straightforward because our basis

functions do not have l0 and j0 labels. A good way to calculate hl02 i is to use l02 = (J − N1 −

S)2 . The required matrix elements are given in Eqs. 10 and 12. For hj 2 i, we compute the
expectation values of j 2 = (N1 + S)2 . Unlike N12 , off-diagonal matrix elements contribute
to the sums for l02 and j 2 .

VI.

AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD OF COMPUTING THE SPECTRUM

In the previous sections of this paper, we propose (method I) using quadrature with a
body-fixed KEO whose z axis is along the inter-monomer Jacobi vector from the centre of
11

mass of O2 to the rare gas atom, in order to treat the spin interaction term proportional
to Sζ2 . In this section we outline a different method (method II) that does not require any
quadrature and uses a body-fixed KEO whose z axis is along the diatomic O2 vector. This
alternative method has disadvantages, but can be used to check calculations. In method I,
quadrature is necessary because the spin basis used to compute the spectrum, |SmS i, has
the label mS for the projection along the inter-monomer Jacobi vector and must therefore
be replaced with a linear combination of spin functions, |SΣi, labelled by Σ (Eq. (16)), the

projection along the diatomic Jacobi vector, in which Sζ2 is diagonal. In method II, the
inter-monomer Jacobi vector is r1 and the diatomic Jacobi vector is r0 . In our notation,
the BF z axis is along r0 . The obvious advantage of method II is that Sζ2 is diagonal, i.e.

Sζ2 |SmS i = m2S |SmS i : there is no need to introduce a second set of spin functions.
An important disadvantage of method II is that the Coriolis coupling is much larger than
for method I. Take NH-He as an example, the rotational constants are: bNH = 16.343 cm−1
and binter = 0.475 cm−1 (both evaluated at the equilibrium geometry on the PES used in this
work). In method I, B0 = binter = 0.475 cm−1 and in method II, B0 = bNH = 16.343 cm−1 .
It is clear that the Coriolis interaction term, proportional to B0 , is much larger in method
II. A second and perhaps more critical disadvantage of method II is that it is difficult to
apply it to larger systems such as O2 -CO where the second monomer is a closed-shell spinless
diatomic molecule rather than an atom. This is because if the BF z is along the O2 vector
then one needs polyspherical angles for CO that are angles relating the orientation of two
unconnected monomers and in terms of these angles potential coupling is large.
The KEO in method II has the same form as the KEO in method I. However, r0 is now the
diatomic Jacobi vector and r1 is now the inter-monomer Jacobi vector. The basis functions
are formally identical to those of method I, Eq. (7) and Eq. (8). Although r 1 is now the
inter-monomer Jacobi vector and using N1 for its angular momentum is unconventional, we
prefer not to change the notation. The KEO terms T DF , Tint and T A take the same form.
The only formal change in the KEO is in the spin-rotation interaction term, the γ0 -related
term (cf. Eq. (4)),
2
Tfine = λ0 (3Sζ2 − S 2 ) + γ0 (J − N1 − S) · S .

This change is necessary because in method I the rotation of the diatomic molecule with
spin is described by r1 and its angular momentum N1 and in method II the rotation of the
12

diatomic molecule with spin is described by r 0 and its angular momentum l0 = J −N1 −S.
Because of this change, the diagonal and off-diagonal matrix elements change slightly. Nonzero diagonal KEO matrix elements, in the basis of Eq. (7), for all terms including the Sζ2
term, are:
hN1 mN1 ; JKM; SmS |T DF |N1 mN1 ; JKM; SmS i

Compared to Eq. (10), the new term 2λ0 m2S is from the 2λ0 Sζ2 term of Tfine and the γ0 -related
term has changed. Eq. (10) does not have the 2λ0 Sζ2 term.
Including the Sζ2 term, the non-zero off-diagonal matrix elements are

the second and third equations are different due to the change of the γ0 -related term in the

RESULTS: SPIN-ROVIBRATIONAL LEVELS OF NH(3 Σ− )-HE

Using both method I and method II, we computed the spin-rovibration levels of NH(3 Σ− )He, which were previously reported in Ref. 32. Cybulski et al. also used two methods: the
SF approach of Tennyson and Mettes[10, 11] and a BF method with the same basis we have
in method I (the z angular momentum and spin components that label basis functions are
along the inter-monomer Jacobi vector). The two sets of energies computed by Cybulski et
al. differ by less than 0.0001 cm−1 . Their accurate calculations allow us to test our methods.
We use the PES “potential I” of Ref. 32 and the same parameters: bNH = 16.343 cm−1 is the
rotational constant of NH in its ground vibrational state; λ0 = 0.920 cm−1 and γ0 = −0.055

cm−1 are, respectively, the spin-spin and spin-rotation interaction constants for NH. We
13

also use the same atomic masses, as in Ref. 32. The NH distance is fixed throughout the
calculations.
The size of the bend basis is determined by max(N1 ) = 25; Cybulski et al. used a
maximum value of 8. 30 Gauss-Legendre quadrature points are used for θ1 , to integrate
the potential and Sζ2 term in Eq. 19. The stretch basis for r0 is 120 sine DVR functions
in the range [3.5, 35] a0 . The total basis size is small enough that when using an iterative
eigensolver, there is no need to optimise the stretch basis.
Cybulski et al. calculate levels with and without Tfine . The two sets of levels are labelled
“no spin” and “with spin” in Table I. “No spin” levels with l0 > 0 are split into three closely
spaced ”with spin” levels. For their “no spin” levels Cybulski et al. use the dissociation
limit on their PES as the zero of energy. For their “with spin” levels they use a different zero
of energy. The zero of energy for “with spin” is the experimental[33] energy of the lowest
rotational-spin NH(3 Σ− ) level. It is 0.0077 cm−1 [32, 33] below the dissociation energy on the
PES. This 0.0077 cm−1 shift is due to Tfine . Our levels are compared to those of Cybulski et
al. in Table I. For both our “no spin” and our “with spin” levels, the zero of energy is the
dissociation limit. To compare Cybulski et al.’s and our “with spin” results, it is therefore
necessary to add -0.0077 cm−1 to the with spin energies in Ref. 32.
There is nearly perfect agreement between our levels and those of Ref. 32. Most differences
between our energy levels and their counterparts in Ref. 32 are less than 0.0001 cm−1 which is
the stated accuracy of Ref. 32. The three levels with l0 = 3 have larger differences. Both with
and without the spin term, our levels are lower by about 0.0014 cm−1 . González-Martı́nez
and Hutson[34] computed the same levels with the BOUND program[35] and also obtained
levels about 0.0014 cm−1 lower than those of Ref. 32. They attribute these differences to the
large r0 tails of the corresponding wavefunctions. Our calculation supports this observation
since we find it is necessary to use a larger max(r0 ) = 35 a0 rather than 30 a0 of Ref. 32 to
converge these three levels.
Assigned values of l0 are also given in Table I. The l0 values are obtained from hl02 i and
are close to l0 (l0 + 1). Our l0 assignments agree with those of Ref. 32; they use L rather
than l0 . Likewise, our J and parity assignments in Table I agree with those of Ref. 32. We
also give K, mS and mN1 assignments that are not in Ref. 32. Most of the reported bound
states can be assigned to K = 0 or 1. However, some are a mixture of K = 0 and 1 and
14

the corresponding K values are indicated as 0/1 or 1/0, with the first number being the one
with the largest contribution to the wavefunction. Because the NH rotational constant is
large, all the states have N1 = 0. All calculated hN12 i are smaller than 0.005. NH(3 Σ− )-He

has a shallow potential well (De = 19.84 cm−1 ) and states with N1 > 0 are not bound. Due
to the constraint, K = mS + mN1 , mS assignments are the same as K assignments and

therefore mS assignments are not given in Table I. Finally, hj 2 i ranges from 2.002 to 2.005,
indicating that all levels are j(NH) = 1 states. j(NH) is a good quantum number because
spin is strongly coupled to NH rotation. As the potential well is shallow and the barrier to
NH rotation is low (3 to 4 cm−1 )[32], we expect j to be a good quantum number.
Finally, NH(3 Σ− )-He energy levels computed with method II (section VI ) and the same
basis sizes agree with those computed with method I to 9 decimal places (in cm−1 ). The
basis is evidently large enough that the levels are well converged despite the larger Coriolis
coupling of method II. When using an iterative eigensolver, basis size is not a problem. Since
the two methods deal with Sζ2 term differently, this excellent agreement indicates that both
methods are correct.

RESULTS: SPIN-ROVIBRATIONAL LEVELS OF O2 (3 Σ−
g )-AR

As mentioned previously, Tennyson and Mettes[10] computed O2 (3 Σ−
g )-Ar levels with a
variational method. In this paper, we use a PES more recent than the one used by Tennyson
and Mettes. The new PES is obtained using supermolecular unrestricted Moller-Plesset
perturbation theory[36]. This computer code for this PES was kindly provided to us by
Mark Severson and is deposited in the supplementary material of this paper. At equilibrium
the molecule is T-shaped with θ1e = 90◦ and r0e = 6.7a0 [36]; the well depth is 117 cm−1 . We
use atomic masses; for the rotational constant of O2 in its ground vibrational state[37] we
use bO2 = 1.437678 cm−1 ; λ0 = 1.98475 cm−1 and γ0 = −0.00845 cm−1 are, respectively, the
spin-spin and spin-rotation interaction constants for O2 [37]. The bend basis size is defined
by max(N1 ) = 25. Only odd rotational states of O2 are physically allowed and we therefore
include only basis functions with odd N1 values. 30 Gauss-Legendre quadrature points are
used for θ1 , to integrate the potential and in Eq. 19. The stretch basis for r0 is 120 sine DVR
[2] functions in the range [3.0, 35] a0 . The O2 distance is fixed throughout the calculation

15

as in the PES.[36]
To understand the pattern of the O2 (3 Σ−
g )-Ar levels, it is useful to discuss the O2 levels.
The N1 = 1 O2 rotational levels are split by the spin interaction term Tfine in Eq. (4) into
three levels. These three levels are from low to high, jO2 = 0, 2 and 1 levels, and are between
0 and 4 cm−1 , determined by the value of λ0 . Here jO2 is the total angular momentum
of O2 . However, due to the anisotropy of the PES, jO2 is not a good quantum number in
O2 (3 Σ−
g )-Ar. Van der Avoird beautifully explained the results of Ref. 10 by using a simple
model. [12] Starting from the BF basis Eq. (7) and using perturbation theory, he noted
that the positive coefficient V2 (r0 ) of the P2 (cos θ) term in the potential expansion, which
is responsible for the T-shaped structure of the O2 -X complex, pushes the mN1 = 0 levels
up relative to the mN1 = ±1 levels by 53 V2 (r0 ) ≈ 12 cm−1 . This is much larger than the
magnitude of the splittings in free O2 caused by the spin interaction term Tfine . Here mN1
refers to the component of N1 along the BF z axis. Four lower-energy ”ladders” are built
on six zeroth-order states obtained from products of the two mN1 = ±1 basis functions with
three spin function with mS = 0, ±1. The rungs of two of the ladders are doublets. The
two components of each doublet have different parity. Two of the ladders have K = 0, one
has K = 1, and one has K = 2. These four ladders are labelled i = 1, 2, 3 and 4.[12] Two
higher-energy ladders are built on three zeroth-order states that are products of the mN1 = 0
basis function and the three spin function with mS = 0, ±1. One of these two ladders has
K = 0 and the other has K = 1. The rungs of the K = 1 ladder are doublets. These two
ladders are labelled i = 5 and 6.[12] No variational calculation for ladders i = 5 and i = 6
3 −
have been reported for O2 (3 Σ−
g )-Ar, but they have been reported for O2 ( Σg )-He.[11] The

characteristics of all six ladders are summarized in Table II.
Using wavefunctions, we assign K, mS and mN1 values to each level. These labels make
it possible to sort the levels we compute into Van der Avoird’s ladders. See Table III for
the ladders of assigned levels and Fig. 2 for an illustrative level diagram. Our four lower
ladders including their K, mS , mN1 , and parity assignments agree well with those of Ref. 10,
shown in Fig. 1 of Ref. 12 (most of the variational levels were not published) even though
the potential energy surfaces are different. The order of the even and odd doublets for the
K > 0 ladders order also agrees. The computed K, mS , mN1 , hl02 i, hN12 i and hj 2 i values
for each level are given in the Supplementary Material (SM). As discussed above, due to the
16

barrier to O2 internal rotation, coupling between N1 and l0 is more important than coupling
between S and N1 , and as a consequence neither the total rotation angular momentum j
of the diatomic nor the end-over-end rotation angular momentum l0 are useful labels. hl02 i
values are not close to l0 (l0 + 1) , as they would be if l0 were a good quantum number,
however, they do increase as one moves up the ladder. In contrast, l0 is almost a good
quantum number for NH-He because it is closer to the free rotor limit. Because the next O2
rotational level N1 = 3 is much higher in energy, all states shown are expected to have large
contributions from N1 = 1 basis functions. However, hN12 i fluctuates between 2.7 and 4.3,
far from expected value of 2.
The ladders of O2 -Ar were recently used to analyse the level structure of CO-O2 .[38] In
Ref. 38, CO-O2 energy levels were divided into two groups and a K = 0 ladder (referred to
as a stack in Ref. 38) in group 1 and a K = 2 ladder in group 2 were linked with the i = 1
ladder (K = 0) and the i = 2 ladder (K = 2) of O2 -Ar. Groups and ladders are labelled
by n(O2 ), j(O2). However, Van der Avoird[12] clearly established that j(O2 ) is not a useful
label for O2 -Ar. It seems likely that j(O2 ) is also not a useful label for CO-O2 .

IX.

RESULTS: SPIN-ROVIBRATIONAL LEVELS OF O2 (3 Σ−
g )-HE

We use an accurate PES determined with the partially spin-restricted open-shell single
and double excitation coupled cluster method with perturbative triples.[39] This is a 3-D
potential, but we fix the O2 distance at the equilibrium value, r1e = 2.282a0 . The potential
well depth is 27.9 cm−1 and the equilibrium geometry is T-shaped with θ1e = 90◦ and
r0e = 6.00a0 [39]. Compared to O2 -Ar, the O2 -He potential well depth is much smaller
and the rare gas mass is much lighter. Therefore, O2 -He states are more de-localized and
the Coriolis coupling has a bigger effect on energy levels, which makes it more difficult to
organize the levels into ladders. The Coriolis coupling is larger for O2 (3 Σ−
g )-He because B0
(see Eq. (1)) is larger. We use atomic masses and the same O2 parameters as for O2 (3 Σ−
g )-Ar.
The bend and stretch bases are the same as for O2 (3 Σ−
g )-Ar.
All of our calculated O2 (3 Σ−
g )-He bound states are given in Table IV. The ZPE is -7.47
cm−1 , it sits about a quarter of the way up the well. In the same table, we also list the levels
computed by Tennyson and Van der Avoird[11] (TA) using a variational method[10] and an

17

older empirical PES[40]. The PES used by TA is certainly less accurate and its well depth
is only 23.5 cm−1 . On their PES, TA found 35 bound states and on the newer PES we find
only 28 bound states, even though the potential we use has a deeper well. Compared to
O2 -Ar, the Coriolis coupling has a greater effect on the energy levels. Many of the O2 -He
states have more than one dominant K component. Moreover, a lot of states have more
than one dominant mN1 . See Table IV. Because the ladders are defined by K and mN1 , the
mixing of these quantum numbers means that it is harder to identify states with ladders.
Tennyson and Van der Avoird[11] assigned ladder labels to their calculated levels by
comparing with the results of a perturbation model, but noted that the O2 -He ladders were
less regular than those of O2 -Ar. They observed, for the first time, two higher ladders i = 5
and i = 6 with mN1 = 0 which they did not assign for O2 -Ar. Using the newer PES, we
are also able to identify i = 5 and i = 6 ladders and find that all the ladders are harder to
distinguish than for O2 -Ar. This is due to the stronger Coriolis coupling. The simplest way
to assign a ladder label i to each of our levels is to compare our level list, for a fixed J and
fixed parity, to the assigned level list of TA and use their assignments for our levels. When
this is done we observe that gaps between levels in a ladder are sometimes irregular. This
means that the two PESs are different enough that we cannot always use the assignments of
2
i and hl02 i to replace some of the TA labels attached
TA and we therefore use mN1 , K, hjO
2

to our levels. Once this is done the gaps between the rungs of the ladders become regular.
See Fig. 3. These re-assigned levels are marked by a star in Table IV. The reassignments
exchange labels between ladders i = 4 and i = 6 and between ladders i = 1 and i = 2. One
type of reassignment is based on values of mN1 . The i = 4 and i = 6 ladders have mN1 = 1
and 0, respectively. Thus, we reassign the the J = 1 odd state at -3.087 cm−1 which has mN1
2
i, and
= 0 to the i = 6 ladder. Another type of reassignment is based on values of K, hjO
2

hl02 i. The rotation of O2 is less hindered in O2 -He than in O2 -Ar and therefore j = N1 + S,

is more nearly a good quantum number. One can therefore tentatively associate ladders
i = 2, 3, 4 with jO2 = 2 (5 components), ladders i = 5, 6 with jO2 = 1 (3 components), and
ladder i = 1 with jO2 = 0 (one component). The ladders then have the same energy order
as the states of O2 for which the rotational energy order is jO2 = 0, 2 and 1.
Another example of states that are reassigned is the two J = 3 even states at -4.703 and
-3.736 cm−1 . They are re-assigned to the i = 2 and i = 1 ladders, respectively, for three
18

2
i are 5.90 and 0.38, indicating jO2 = 2 and 0. Second, their hl02 i
reasons. First, their hjO
2

are 2.57 and 11.73, indicating l0 = 1 and 3. If ladder i = 1 has jO2 = 0 then, because
J = jO2 + l0 , J = l0 and therefore a J = 3 level must have l0 = 3 and hence belong to
ladder i = 1. Third, the K values of the two levels are 1/2/0 and 0 which also supports
this assignment because ladders i = 2 and i = 1 have K = 2 and 1. This example also
shows that due to the rotation of O2 being less hindered, l0 and jO2 are close to being good
quantum numbers for O2 -He, whereas they are basically useless for O2 -Ar, as discussed in
the previous section.
One serious problem in the ladder assignment occurs for the i = 5 ladder. The first i = 5
state at -3.500 cm−1 is a pure K = 0 state as expected, but the next three i = 5 states
are all pure K = 1 states. States with different values of K should not occur in the same
ladder. An illustrative level diagram for all the bound states of O2 (3 Σ−
g )-He is shown in Fig.
3. One can compare it with the same diagram in Ref. 11 and see that the ladder pattern
is quite different. From Fig. 3, we see that level spacings between different ladders are
rather different, indicating different values of end-over-end rotation constants. For all K > 0
ladders, we find that the splitting between doublets of each rung is rather large, sometimes
larger than the J-spacings within the ladder, which is in stark contrast with the O2 -Ar case.

X.

CONCLUSION

In this paper we present a new approach for including the spin-spin term that couples
rotational angular momenta and electronic spin angular momentum. It is new in two ways.
First, it is new because it uses an iterative eigensolver to solve a matrix representation of the
Schroedinger equation. Second, it is new because it does not expand the potential in terms of
Legendre polynomials and use equations involving 3−j symbols to obtain matrix elements of
both the potential and the spin-spin term. Instead, quadrature is used for both and matrixvector products are done by evaluating sums sequentially. The method of this paper can be
used without expanding the potential and without employing angular momentum theory to
derive matrix elements. This makes it easy to use with a general PES.
One might think that using quadrature when it is possible to replace matrix elements
with exact closed-form equations would increase the cost of the calculation. This is not

19

true. It is not true for the same reason that the cost of the MVPs one must evaluate when
using quadrature for PES matrix elements and a SOP PES is the same. In some cases we
expect the new method to be cheaper. It is certainly cheaper if, when expanded in terms
of Legendre polynomials, the PES has many terms and also cheaper for molecules for which
the potential matrix is large. Moreover, if the molecule of the molecule-rare gas complex
were larger than a diatomic and if its shape was not fixed, then the standard approach of
building and diagonalizing a matrix would be much more costly. Experiments have been
done on many O2 containing complexes, e.g. N2 O-O2 , H2 O-O2 , HF-O2 etc. The method of
this paper opens the door to doing calculations on these complexes.

TABLE IV: All bound spin-rovibrational levels of O2 -He(3 Σ−
g ) (in cm ) relative to the dissociation

energy without Tf ine . TA refers to Tennyson and van der Avoird[11]. TW is This Work. To the
TA levels of Ref. 11, we have added 0.246 cm−1 , the energy of the J = 1 O2 state, to account for
the difference in the definition of the zero of energy in this paper and in TA. All levels in this table
are below 0.246 cm−1 and are bound, except for one level at 0.248 cm−1 .

FIG. 1: Two coupling schemes used for systems consisting of an open shell Σ diatomic molecule
and a closed shell atom, such as O2 -Ar or NH-Ar. In scheme (a), the vector r0 is associated with the
intermonomer Jacobi vector. In scheme (b), the vector r0 is associated with the diatomic vector.
The z axes of the body-fixed (BF) (marked in blue) and dimer-fixed frames in both schemes are
along r0 and the x-axes of the BF frames are along r0 × r1 × r0 .

27

FIG. 2:

Fine-structure rovibrational levels of O2 -Ar. Theoretical levels are sorted into ladders

based on the approximate quantum numbers K, mS , and mN1 . The first four ladders i = 1, · · · , 4
originate from mN1 = 1 states of O2 . The next two ladders i = 5, 6 originate from mN1 = 0 states
of O2 . Indicated with each level is J(e/o) where e/o is even/odd parity.

28

FIG. 3:

Fine-structure rovibrational levels of O2 -He. See the caption of Fig. 2 for additional

information about the ladders. The dashed line is the dissociation limit with O2 in its J = 1
rotational state with energy 0.246 cm−1 .
