Following the idea of nucleon clustering and light-nuclei production in relativistic heavy-ion collisions close to the QCD critical-end point, we address the quantum effects affecting the interaction of
several nucleons at finite temperature. For this aim we use the K-harmonics method to four-nucleon
states (α particle), and also develop a novel semiclassical “flucton” method at finite temperature,
based on certain classical paths in Euclidean time, and apply it to two- and four-particle configurations. To study possible effects on the light-nuclei production close to the QCD critical point,
we also made such calculations with modified internuclear potentials. For heavy-ion experiments,
we propose new measurements of light-nuclei multiplicity ratios which may show enhancements due
to baryon preclustering. We point out the special role of the O(50) four-nucleon excitations of
α-particle, feeding into the final multiplicities of d, t, 3 He, and 4 He, and propose to directly look for
their 2-body decays.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In the past decade the physics of heavy-ion collisions
has significantly widened its scope. Traditional studies
of Au+Au and Pb+Pb collisions at the highest energies
of the RHIC (Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider) and the
LHC (Large Hadron Collider) have quantified the unusual properties of the quark-gluon plasma. A significant
progress was reached in studies of “small systems”, central p + A and high-multiplicity p + p, in which radial,
elliptic and triangular flows have been observed, confirming hydrodynamical explosions at sufficiently large multiplicities [1]. The final particle composition is well described close to the phase transition line by the so-called
statistical hadronization models [2].
With these progresses at the high-energy frontier, there
is a growing interest in better understanding the lower
collision energies, related to larger baryonic densities.
The suggestion of the possible existence of the QCD critical point and therefore increased event-by-event fluctuations [3] has lead to the RHIC Beam-Energy Scan (BES)
program. Complementing it, dedicated low-energy colliders are under construction in Germany (FAIR-GSI,
Darmstadt) and Russia (NICA, Dubna), with similar
projects under consideration in China (HIAF) and Japan
(J-PARC-HI).
At this time, experiments show two particular intriguing observations which might be related to the QCD critical point. One is the significant modification of the shape
of net-proton multiplicity distribution (large scaled kurtosis) at the lowest RHIC collision energies observed by
STAR collaboration [4]. Another (to be shown in Fig. 11)
√
is an apparent increase at sN N = 20 − 30 GeV of the
tritium production relative to deuterium and to the statistical hadronization model in the same experiment [5].
In our previous paper [6] we put forward the idea that
a sizable scaled kurtosis of the proton distribution is another aspect of the preclustering of nucleons (or prenu-

clei) at the freeze-out stage, due to the modification of
N N potential. This effect would also lead to an increase
of light-nuclei production with respect to the statistical
model expectations. Let us present some qualitative arguments emphasizing the main points made in Ref. [6].
To begin with let us compare the situation at the
freeze-out of high-energy heavy-ion collisions with other
known situations in which various nuclear fragments—
and especially light nuclei—are known to be produced [7,
8]. In particular, their natural production is known to occur in the Big Bang, and later in stars. In these cases the
temperature T is much lower than the binding energy of
the states, T  B 1 , and the corresponding Boltzmann
factors exp(B/T ) are large and play a crucial role. In
heavy-ion collisions at semirelativistic energies, one has
T ∼ B and the production of nuclear fragments.
Unlike these conditions, the freeze-out temperatures
we will consider are large compared to the binding energy
B ∼ few MeV  T = 100 − 150 MeV ,
and therefore the binding energies of the resulting light
nuclei are basically irrelevant.
The preclusters we discuss are statistical correlations
of several nucleons at relative distances 1 − 2 fm induced
by the interbaryon potential V (r). The phenomenological (unmodified) nuclear potential that we considered in
Ref. [6] (called VA0 in that paper) was the Serot-Walecka
potential [9],

with ασ = 6.04, mσ = 500 MeV, αω = 15.17, mω = 782

σ mass (solid line) and with a reduced mass supposedly to
happen close to the critical region (dashed line). Those we
consider to be the minimal and maximal possible magnitude
for near-critical line potential.

However, the relevant ratio for precluster formation is
not B/T but the Boltzmann factor with the maximal
depth of the potential to temperature exp (−V (rmin )/T ).
For the potential Eq. (1) this ratio is
|V (rmin )|
1 1
∼ − ,
T

and thus clustering is relatively scarce.
However, there are two important regimes in which
this simple conclusion can be reversed, and rather large
correlations can be achieved. The first regime is when
the effective mass of the σ mode is strongly reduced because of the closeness of chiral symmetry restoration at
T > Tc ≈ 155 MeV. According to studies of chiral transition at µ = 0 [10], and to the discussion in our previous
paper [6], the initial N N potential the σ mass can be reduced from 500 MeV down to mσ ∼ 285 MeV. As shown
in dashed line in Fig. 1 this modification results in crucial
changes of the effective potential, inverting the situation
to
|V (rmin )|
∼2−3 .
T
This situation becomes more evident in the vicinity of
the QCD critical point (if it exists) since the hypothetical
critical mode becomes (nearly) massless, making appear
long-range forces associated with its exchange.
These large Boltzmann factors exp(|V (rmin )|/T ) play
much more important role when several nucleons are involved. For example, the system composed by N = 4
nucleons in an approximate tetrahedral configuration has
six relative potentials, so the Boltzmann factor enters
with the sixth power.

In Ref. [6] the real-time dynamics has been quantified
by means of classical Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. While we studied specific clusters with 4–13 nucleons, our main focus in that paper was on skewness and
kurtosis of the baryon number distribution, in connection with the results of the BES program at RHIC. We
have demonstrated that even modest modifications of the
nuclear potentials at the freeze-out conditions may significantly enhance the baryon correlations.
However, the Boltzmann factor describes only classical thermodynamics, and the MD simulations account
only for the classical dynamics of nucleons. In the onset
of clustering, one needs to include also quantum effects,
expected to reduce the formed correlations. This is the
question we focus on in this paper, where we continue
the study of preclusters.
More specifically, we will focus on quantum corrections
of pairwise potentials between nucleons, and introduce a
semiclassical method at finite temperature giving rise to
the “flucton” configuration. This method will be also
applied to states with 3 and 4 particles with a very specific symmetry. In addition, we will focus on four-nucleon
preclusters of the ppnn (or α-particle) type. Only in this
case one may think of all four particles as distinguishable (all in different spin-isospin states), without account
for effects of Fermi-Dirac statistics. Its ground state is
the only light nuclei which is relatively strongly bound.
In fact, it is well known that 12 C, 16 O and perhaps
even 24 Mg have strong α-particle correlations, and their
lowest states are consistent with few α-particle BoseEinstein condensation [11]. The four-nucleon preclusters are qualitatively different from two- and three-body
clusters. While the latter have only one (barely) bound
states, the former has one deeply-bound ground state and
∼ 50 states incorporating next-shell excitations near zero
energy. While this fact is experimentally known, it has
been overlooked in any discussion (we are aware of) of
the d, t,3 He production. We use this novel semiclassical
method, as well as the K-harmonics method, to correctly
include quantum effects. Finally, we will comment on
how experiments can access an overproduction of light
nuclei, and propose new experimental measurements of
light-nuclei ratios (in the same lines of the recently proposed tp/d2 ratio) with an increased ability to signal the
presence of the QCD critical point.
In Sec. II we study the two- and four-nucleon systems
using a genuine quantum mechanical method by solving
the two-body Schrödinger equation and the K-harmonics
method, respectively. We will see that important quantum corrections appear when the interaction potential
dominates over thermal effects. In Sec. III we introduce
the “flucton” method at finite temperature as a semiclassical approximation to the full quantum solution. We
apply it to two- and four-nucleon systems at finite temperature, and consider the effect of a modified N N potential due to the critical-point dynamics. In Sec. IV we
propose several observables in the form of light-nuclei ratios in which the critical correlations could be observed

3
in experiment. Some discussions on the connection between preclusters and light-nuclei are presented in Sec. V,
where we also comment on the experimental situation of
the 4 He spectra and the need to account for its excited
states. Finally, in Sec. VI we present our conclusions.

II. THEORY OF FEW-NUCLEON QUANTUM
SYSTEMS IN A THERMAL ENVIRONMENT

Before we begin the theory part of this paper, let us
recapitulate its main goals:
(i) develop the necessary tools to evaluate the density
matrices for few-nucleon systems at finite temperature;
(ii) quantify clustering probabilities, focusing on the
four-nucleon system;
(iii) study how the clustering phenomenon depends on
possible in-matter potential modifications.
The standard textbook definition of the density
matrix—the probability to find quantum/thermal system at a (multidimensional) coordinate x0 —is straightforward to compute as
X
P (x0 ) =
|ψi (x0 )|2 e−Ei /T ,
(2)
i

by combining probabilities in all stationary states, bound
and unbound, with their subsequent weighting with the
Boltzmann factor. ψi (x0 ) and Ei are the wave functions
(eigenfunctions) and energies (eigenvalues) of the state i.
We will be applying this definition in this section, first
for two and then for four nucleons. An alternative semiclassical approach to this problem at finite temperature
will be developed in the next section.

A.

The density matrix for two nucleons

The two-nucleon problem is essentially a onedimensional (radial) problem, so the density matrix at
finite T can be calculated using a complete set of solutions of the Schrödinger equation. Simplifying the
situation to central forces, without spin/isospin dependence and without electromagnetism, one combines the
pn, nn, pp pairs into one generic N N case. In this case
one should find with sufficient accuracy that there is one
(near) bound state with essentially zero energy.
The original Serot-Walecka potential in Eq. (1), while
it can lead to reasonable properties for infinite nuclear
matter [6], does not possess any bound state. For an
illustration let us reduce the repulsion, and use αω =
9.42, to increase the depth of the potential. This is the
value we are using in this section only.

In addition to the N N potential one needs to separately consider the centrifugal potential,
L
∆Vrot
=

L(L + 1)
,
2mR r2

(3)

for various nonzero values of L = 0, 1, 2, ... (mR = mN /2
is the reduced mass, with mN being the nucleon mass).
In order not to deal with a continuous spectrum of scattering states we use a standard method: put a system in
a confining “cup” potential, chosen in a form

8
r
Vcup =
,
(4)
Rcup
with large enough Rcup = 10 fm.
With all these ingredients we numerically solve
−

u00L (r)
L
+ (VN N + Vcup + ∆Vrot
)uL (r) = E L uL (r) ,
2mR
(5)

with uL (r) = rRL (r) and the radial wave-function RL (r)
has been factorized from the total one together with the
spherical harmonics [ψ(r) = R(r)Y (θ, φ)]. The normalization of ψ(r) imposes, as usual,
Z
dr|uL (r)|2 = 1 .
(6)
We find 60 energies and wave functions for each L. The
beginning of the energy spectrum at L = 0 is (in units of
fm−1 ≈ 197 MeV)
EiL=0 = − 0.0113, 0.0749, 0.204, 0.369, 0.564, 0.786...
The only bound state is “Walecka deuteron” with an
energy of
p−2.2 MeV and a root-mean-square (r.m.s.) radius of hr2 i ' 2.6 fm (the physical deuteron also contains a small admixture of L = 2 component, which we
do not obtain in this simple example with a central potential).
Using this set of states one can find the quantumthermal density matrix
X
L
P (r, T ) =
(2L + 1)|ψL,i (r)|2 e−βEi ,
(7)
i,L

where β = 1/T , and i runs over all states with a given
quantum number L. We consider L = 0, 1 and 2 (in all
our examples the angular dependence is included in the
wave functions ψL,i (r) and conveniently integrated over).
In our approximation with an external Vcup all states
are bound. Otherwise, the continuum version of Eq. (7)
should be used to account for the unbound states [12].
Examples at two different temperatures are shown in
Fig. 2, for T ' 20, 100 MeV for different angular momenta. We sum over the first 60 levels for each value
of L. It is important to note that in the results of this
figure, the N N potential itself is not yet modified by the

temperature. The difference between the curves is entirely given by thermal excitation of states other than
the ground one.
From these plots one observes that states with nonzero
angular momentum L > 0 contribute only minimally
at low temperatures (upper plot), even including their
larger degeneracy 2L + 1. At high temperatures (lower
plot) these states contribute substantially to the density
matrix. However, at such temperature one also expects
the in-medium modification of the N N potential. Using
a Serot-Walecka potential with mσ = 285 MeV we get
the result at T = 100 MeV in Fig. 3. Again, the higherpartial waves are subdominant with respect to L = 0 in
the density matrix. In Sec. V we will come back to the
deuteron example and comment about the wave package
interpretation of the cluster from this density matrix, and
introduce the Wigner distribution of the deuteron.

In this section we study the four-body system using
a pure quantum mechanical method, the K-harmonics,
which goes back to the 1960’s [13]. Its main idea is to
focus on quantum mechanics along the “hyperdistance”
axis in the nine-dimensional space, while other coordinates can be treated via corresponding angular harmonics. We present more details in appendix A. Historically,
this method was applied only to the ground states of light
nuclei, which it describes well. In particular, it correctly
reproduced the binding of 4 He [14].
As usual, we start with the lowest, most symmetric
ground states, obtained from a 1D radial Schrödinger
equation for the hyperdistance ρ, defined in Eq. (A3) as
a sum over Jacobi coordinates squared. We briefly indicate in Appendix A the derivation of the corresponding
Schrödinger-like equation in the case of 4 He [14] here we
only note that the squared hyperdistance is related to r
coordinate, the distance between any two nucleons in a
tetrahedral configuration, via the simple relation
ρ2 =

6 2
r .

(8)

Solving the eigenvalue problem in Eq. (A5) we have obtained 40 lowest eigenstates using the simplest potential
V1 from Ref. [14] and the Coulomb term between the two
protons. The ground state energy we find is E0 = −27.8
MeV, close to the experimental value of E0exp = −28.3
MeV.
Rather unexpectedly, we also find the second bound
state missed by our predecessors in Ref. [14], with J P =
0+ with energy E1 = −2.8 MeV. To determine whether
this state is physical, we show in Table I a compilation
of the excited states of 4 He. Among them there is just

5
one 0+ state, with a binding energy of

which is close enough to the one we found to identify
them, as the same second radial excitation. A plot with
both 0+ wave functions χ0 (ρ), χ1 (ρ) is shown in Fig. 4.

At finite temperature, we also use the unbound states
to weight them with the corresponding Boltzmann factor and calculate the thermal density matrix. The results
are shown in Fig. 5 for T = 100 MeV. In the upper plot
we present the results using the potential V1 given in
Ref. [14]. The solid line is the weighted density matrix
at T = 100 MeV compared to the contribution of the
lowest bound state only (blue dashed line). For this (unmodified) potential the contribution of excited state to
the density matrix is important as can be seen from the
difference between the two curves.

Modification of the internucleon potential

To see what happens if the interaction potential is
medium-modified, we repeat the calculation with the
same form of the potential, but with the coefficient of
the attractive term double. In this case the minimum
of the potential reaches ∼ −400 MeV, similarly to what
happens in Fig. 1.
This modified potential now has six radial bound
states: Their energies in MeV are
E = −226.1, −120.1, −52.6, −17.3, −3.4, −0.1 .

both cases the blue dashed lines show the contribution of the
lowest bound state. The units of the OY axis are fm−1 .

of Fig. 5. In contrast to the upper plot (for unmodified
potential) the lowest state dominates the density matrix.
It is not surprising (we already saw this for the N = 2
case), since its binding is more than twice the temperature. In that figure we can read the magnitude of the
correlation, relative to the constant asymptotic distance
(the thermal contribution of propagating positive energy
states) increases from ∼ 0.4 to ∼ 12, a huge factor.
Finally we comment about the normalization of the
density matrix in the N = 4 case. The wave function
ψ(ρ) in nine dimensions is normalized as
Z
Z
1 = |ψi (ρ)|2 d9 ρ = |χi (ρ)|2 dρ ,
(10)

with all the angular dependence factorized and integrated
out. So the integrated density matrix has dimension of 9
or volume cube, respectively, the effect is to be multiplied

6
by the baryon density cubed n3B . The virial expansion of
statistical mechanics calls such a term the fourth virial
coefficient.

We present a minimal content of the “flucton” method
in Appendix B.

SEMICLASSICAL “FLUCTON” METHOD
AT NONZERO TEMPERATURES

xturn

In this section we introduce a novel semiclassical
method to approximate the calculation of the thermal
density matrix for two-, three- and four-nucleon systems.
It is the generalization of the “flucton” path [15] to fewbody systems at finite temperature.
A.

Semiclassical theory at nonzero temperature

Semiclassical approximations are well-known tools,
V (x)
both in quantum mechanics and
quantum field theory. Standard textbooks of quantum mechanics usually
start with Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization conditions,
and
xturn
semiclassical Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation for the wave function [16]. Unfortunately, extending such methods beyond the one-dimensional case
(or multidimensional with separable variables) proved to
be difficult. Also p
already the first WKB correction to
classical term, 1/ p(x) is not correct and contains a
x0
nonphysical singularity at the turning point.
As shown by Feynman [12, 17, 18], the density matrix
for any quantum system can be expressed by the path
integrals, over paths passing through the point x0 . Analytic continuation to Euclidean (Matsubara) time defined
on a circle τ ∈ [0, β = ~/T ] lead to its finite temperature
generalization
I
P (x0 ) = Dx(τ ) e−SE [x(τ )]/~ ,
(11)
taken over the periodic paths which start and end at
x = x0 . This expression has led to multiple applications, perturbative (using Feynman diagrams) or numerical (e.g. lattice gauge theory).
Another interesting usage of this expression is development of a novel semiclassical theory. Its main idea is
that in certain conditions the path integral is dominated
by minimal action (classical) path, called “flucton”. The
idea was introduced in Ref. [15] (it was also later suggested independently in Ref. [19].). Unlike the WKB approximation, this approach works for multidimensional
and quantum-field-theory settings. It also leads to a systematic perturbative series based on Feynman diagrams,
with clear rules for each order.
Systematic application of this method at zero temperature (β → ∞) for a number of quantum mechanical
problems has been developed in Refs. [20–22]. The quantum corrections have been calculated to three loops, and
shown to be in exact agreement with asymptotic expansion of the ground-state wave functions at large distances.
The reader can find all the details in these references.

FIG. 6. Two sketches explaining properties of the flucton
classical paths. The upper one shows the (flipped) potential
−V (x) versus its coordinate. The needed path starts from
arbitrary observation point x0 (red dot), goes uphill, turns
back at the turning point xturn (blue dot), and returns to x0
during the required period β = ~/T in imaginary time. The
lower plot illustrates the same path as a function of Euclidean
time τ defined on a “Matsubara circle” with circumference β.

At T = 0 quantum systems are in their ground states,
and therefore studies of the density matrix are related to
semiclassical description of the ground state wave functions. It has been shown in the above mentioned papers
how path integral semiclassical higher-order corrections
correspond to the asymptotic expansion of solutions to
Schrödinger equation.
At finite temperatures the path integral is modified,
but it can still be dominated by certain “flucton” paths,
which should satisfy a number of conditions. They should
(i) have minimal action, thus satisfy classical equation
of motion with Euclidean time τ = it;
(ii) be still periodic, starting and ending at the designated observation point x = x0 ;

harmonic and anharmonic oscillators, are briefly summarized in Appendix B. Applications of this method to
nucleon systems with N = 2, 4 are given in the following

Two-nucleon system as a thermal flucton

In this section we apply for the first time the flucton
method described in Appendix B to a two-body potential
at finite temperature. Before we start let us remind two
limits, in which the method leads to some obvious results:
1. At large T (β → 0) the periodic paths have no time
to propagate, so the system stays at x(τ ) = x0 . The
action is SE → βV (x0 ) which corresponds to the
usual classical Boltzmann factor.
2. At small T the system is mostly in the ground state
and the density matrix P → |ψ(x0 )|2 . The flucton
method obviously yields the semiclassical version of
ψ(x0 ).
For two particles the Euclidean action for their relative
motion reads

the pairwise (inverted) potential VN N , and the coefficient
1/4 in the kinetic energy appears because of the use of the
nucleon mass instead of the reduced mass mR = mN /2).
The classical equation of motion is
r̈ =

2 ∂V (r)
,
mN ∂r

(13)

whose solution is the required flucton path r(τ ) = rfluc (τ )
as a function of the observation point r0 . The density
matrix is proportional to the action of this solution,
P (r0 ) ∼ e−SE [rfluc (τ )] .

The observation point will be simply denoted as r in our
plots.
In Fig. 7 we compare the probabilities (not normalized)
of two nucleons being at distance r from each other at a
temperature T = 100 MeV, calculated by both methods:
the flucton method (dots) and a classical Boltzmann factor (solid and dashed lines). We use two potentials, the
original Walecka-like potential Eq. (1) with mσ = 500
MeV, and another with mσ = 285 MeV, with increased

attraction. As one can see, for the unmodified potential the effect is rather modest, and classical thermodynamics (solid line) coincides with the semiclassical result
(squares). At small values of r the potential presents a
steep repulsive wall, which makes the classical solution
go quick to zero, whereas the flucton case presents larger
probability due to the quantum barrier penetration. The
comparison between methods is however very different
for the modified potential, for which the correlation is
significant as VN N it is not small compared to T . Again,
quantum penetration into the potential to the right of
the minimum makes the probability for the flucton larger
than the classical expectation. This is a clear illustration
of how quantum effects can be taken into account in a
classical calculation.
The probability P (r) is not directly normalizable. This
happens because the potential has the asymptotic limit
to zero when r → ∞, and therefore P (r) → 1. This is
similar to the pair correlation function of infinite systems
(we comment on these in our Ref. [6]) which tends to 1 at
large distances, the value of the ideal gas. Similarly here,
one should normalize P (r) to the ideal gas value, e.g. to
quantify the effect between potentials, we calculate the
so-called correlation volume
Z
veff = 4π drr2 [P (r) − 1] .
(15)
For the two Boltzmann cases shown in Fig. 7, they are
veff = 5.3 and 151 fm3 , respectively. The nucleon density
under freeze-out conditions is a fraction of the nuclear
matter density n0 ≈ 0.16 fm−3 . Multiplying it by veff one
finds that while the original potential leads to probability

In fact, already in 1659 Huygens discovered the isochrone

any initial point (at zero initial velocity) takes the same
time. While several paths may satisfy the requirements
needed for a “finite temperature fluctons” with the right
period, it is not clear a priori which of these solutions
should contribute to the path integral. One could select
the ones with the smallest action (the largest contribution to the path integral). In this case, all points belonging to the loop should simply be disregarded, and
the semiclassical density matrix simply has a jump in
the derivative, a kind of first-order transition (notice the
formal similarity with the Maxwell construction for the
determination of the thermodynamical potential across
a first-order transition cf. Fig. 12 in Ref. [24] by one of
us). However, other solutions to the classical equation of

The continuous lines show the classical Boltzmann factor
exp(−6V (r)/T ) while the dots correspond to the semiclassical flucton configuration. The N N potential used is the
Serot-Walecka potential Eq. (1) with mσ = 500 MeV.

The exponent of the action, shown in Fig. 9 is huge,
especially in the case of small temperatures. The
pre-exponent effects due to quantum/thermal fluctuations, not yet calculated, are expected to modify it
strongly. While classical motion preserves the tetrahedral shape, quantum fluctuations do not, they happen
in full 3(N − 1) = 9-dimensional space and they are not
scale-invariant.

D.

N = 4 fluctons in the hyperdistance
representation

Another—and as it turns out much more realistic—
approach to semiclassical theory is to combine it with
quantum mechanics along the hyperdistance ρ axis. As
mentioned in the Appendix A, it leads to appearance of
effective repulsive potential Veff (ρ) = 12/(2mN ρ2 ), competing with the attractive nuclear forces. Without it one
would not be able to reproduce light nuclei binding by a
simple one-dimensional equation.
It is therefore reasonable to apply the semiclassical
methods, at zero or nonzero T , in the hyperdistance representation including this potential. As shown in the
Appendix the effective potential for the 1D Schrödinger
equation is (given as a function of the hyperdistance ρ)
Veff (ρ) = W (ρ) +

12
+ VC (ρ) ,
2mN ρ2

(23)

where VC is the Coulomb potential.
We solve the semiclassical equations of motion to find
the flucton solution for two temperatures T = 25, 100
MeV, using the potential Veff (ρ) and its version with a
double attraction, to see the effect of the critical point
on the N N potential.
In Fig. 10 we present our results in four panels, for the
four combination of temperatures and potentials.

PRECLUSTERS AND PRODUCTION OF
LIGHT NUCLEI

The main motivation for this paper is that the possible
modification of the N N potential close to the freeze-out
time, will lead to a preclustering effect of nucleons in
heavy-ion collisions. Furthermore, this effect is significantly enhanced if the internucleon potential is modified
due to the σ mass modification near the QCD critical
point [6].
Before proceeding to discuss potential observables, let
us start by reminding once more what we call the preclustering phenomenon. It is very important to keep in mind
that the preclusters we study are very different from “nuclear fragments”, and also light nuclei (cf. Table I in
Ref. [6]).
The light nuclei we will be discussing, with N = 2, 3
nucleons, d, t,3Λ H,3 He, typically have only one bound
state. Furthermore, they all have very small binding energies, even in nuclear standards. The deuteron binding
is only Bd = 2.2 MeV. An extreme case is the hypertriton

Flucton

N N pairwise potential is given in Eq. (A7) as used in
Ref. [14]. In this case the system is classical and the
Boltzmann factor account for all dynamics. For lower
temperatures, where the potential is well suited, we can
see the result in the top right panel. One can already see
some quantum deviations from Boltzmann expectations.
In the bottom left panel we present the N N potential
Eq. (A7) with increased attraction by a factor of 2 at
T = 100 MeV. In this example the temperature is still
dominating over the potential, and a sizable deviation
from Boltzmann is only obtained for T = 25 MeV.

(24)

Clearly the physical sizes of these states are very large,
comparable or larger than fireballs they come from.
These objects are therefore very fragile, easily destroyed in any collision due to large cross section, and
the cascade codes typically predicted strong suppression
of their production. And yet, as shown in Ref. [2], their
production rate is in good agreement with the prediction
of statistical thermal model based on “resonance gas”
thermodynamics. This model knows only vacuum masses
of these particles, entirely ignoring their small binding.
To reconcile the data with codes, in literature [28] some
so-far unobserved “resonances” were introduced, which
have small sizes and “reasonable” destruction cross section, decaying into light nuclei after freezeout. The explanation we suggest is that one does not need such hypothetical resonances: their role is played by preclusters we

All these ratios have the same powers of fugacity in denominators and numerators, which thus cancel, eliminating the trivial dependence on baryonic chemical potential. Furthermore, in classical statistical mechanics the
momentum and coordinate partition functions factorize,
simplifying the discussion. Mean kinetic energy per nucleon, either a single one or inside any precluster, is the
same, hKi = 3T /2. So, in all ratios the kinetic parts of
the Boltzmann factor, exp(−K/T ) for each nucleon, do
cancel as well. Volume factors also cancel. What is left
are factors from statistical weights, powers of masses in

study. They are not bound states or resonances, just statistical correlations, with an energy uncertainty ∆E ∼ T
and relatively compact in coordinate space.
Basically, there are two experimental signatures of
preclusters. One, discussed in detail in Ref. [6] is a modified proton multiplicity distribution. Another one, which
we will address below, is a certain modification of lightnuclei production.
As we already mentioned, overall production of light
nuclei (and antinuclei) is well reproduced by the statistical thermal model; see, e.g., Ref. [2]. By “overall” we
mean that each extra nucleon (antinucleon, upper sign)
is suppressed by the same factor exp[−(mN ± µB )/Tch ].
The fitted values of chemical freezeout temperature and
baryon chemical potential are key parameters, which give
us ideas about matter as enters the hadronic world, and
their dependence on the collision energy is well documented in [2]. From the experimental results of the NA49
collaboration [29] one can also see the good agreement between the 3 He and t multiplicity and the thermal model
at different collision energies. However, recent preliminary results of STAR collaboration [30] do not show a
similar agreement. It will be important to study in the
future the origin of this discrepancy with the thermal
model.
However, behind this (overall successful) description
one can observe some “finer structure”. It becomes visible in ratios, where the mentioned suppression factors
cancel out. One observable ratio is the tritium-protondeuterium combination defined as

Focusing only on STAR data, and assuming that the
deviation from 1 and the corresponding peak of the Otpd
ratio is due to the modification of the N N potential, it
is very tantalizing to consider the ratios Eqs. (28), (29),
and (30), as heavier nuclei (with a larger number of nucleon pairings) would produce an enhanced effect. These
ratios involving 4 He would increase the power in the exponential by a factor 2 or 3.
Assuming the effect is entirely ascribed to the modification of VN N , it is very easy to generate an approximate
prediction for each of these ratios, using experimental ratio Otpd [5] as input. We plot the results in Fig. 12 for
each of the ratios (notice that the result for Oαtp3 Hed has
been divided a factor of 5). While the absolute value of
these ratios depend on spin degeneracies and other factor,
the important feature is the relative difference between
the peak and the values at low and high energies.

the t and d bindings in a statistical model, one would
expect this combination to be equal to unit value. It
√
is indeed the case at sN N = 200 GeV (the most-right
point), with good accuracy.
Focusing on the specific ratios of α, t, p, d production,
in which many kinematical factors drop out, one should
expect their non monotonous energy dependence. The
status of experimental measurements of these ratios is
as follows. A maximum in t − p − d combination was
√
originally reported, by NA49 [29], to be around sN N ≈
9 GeV. Very recent preliminary data [5] from STAR BES
√
also see a maximum, although at sN N = 20 − 30 GeV.
√
However, at collision energies sN N ∼ 10 − 40 GeV
the value of the ratio observed is larger than one, roughly
by the factor 2. If correct, then this enhancement implies that under such conditions the potential and the
temperature are comparable V /T ∼ O(1) as indicated in
the relation Eq. (27). We suggest that this extra tritium
production comes from the preclustering phenomenon we
discuss.
With the current data accuracy it is not possible to tell
whether Fig. 11 show a one-maximum or a double-hump
distribution. Let us note, that apart from the hypothetical QCD critical point, the non monotonous behavior can
be caused by the onset of other (perhaps less exciting but
still very important) phenomena that are also expected
in the same energy range.
One of them is the maximum fireball lifetime as a
√
function of sN N , well documented by recent femtoscopy
√
data [33], located at sN N ≈ 47 GeV. As indicated
already on the early study [34] of hydrodynamical expansion, there are two reasons for its existence, playing
together in this energy range. Those are: (i) the “softest
point” in the equation of state, a minimum in the speed
of sound c2s = (dP/d)s or maximal compressibility
of matter. (ii) the maximal re-scattering rate at the
freeze-out. When the densities of pions and nucleons are
comparable Nπ ∼ NN , the largest relevant cross section
(reaching σπN ∼ 200 mb at the ∆ peak) is most effective.

can be performed in these low-energy collisions, and their
multiplicity measured with certain level of confidence,
then these ratios would prove the sensitivity of the N N
potential to the presence of a near-by critical point.
It is important to mention that on top of the purely
thermal production, the particle yields suffer from feeddown of hadron resonances which must be taken into account, being the most relevant to this study those decaying into protons. While we have not considered this
effect, we assume that this proton feed-down is constant
enough around the critical region, so that a maximum of
these ratios can still be sensible indicators of the critical
behavior.

V.

FROM PRECLUSTERS TO LIGHT NUCLEI

The understanding of the formation of various nuclear
species is among the central topics of nuclear physics, extensively studied in cosmological and astrophysical settings. As commented in the introduction, what is common to the regimes in which nuclei are produced in cosmos is that the available temperatures are much lower
than the binding energies, T  |B|. The nuclear binding therefore dominates the respective Boltzmann factors
exp(−B/T ).
The setting we discuss here—the freeze-out of highenergy heavy-ion collisions—is in the opposite regime, in
which light-nuclei bindings are few MeV and negligible,
B  T . One might therefore think that such fragile
objects cannot be produced. In other words, “Snow flakes
do not jump out of a hot oven.” We already mentioned

13
that experiments show this conclusion to be wrong, and
we now propose and explanation.
There are basically two ideas which we try to develop
in this work. One is that this pessimistic conclusion does
not hold for systems of four and more nuclei. First of all,
the ground state binding of 4 He is no longer small, even
for unmodified potential. Second, starting with fournucleon clusters, multiple (∼ 50) states exist near zero
binding, with interesting decay modes. Furthermore, let
us emphasize, once again, that one should not be looking
at the stationary states or their binding, but for preclustering phenomenon. Therefore, one has to compare 3T /2
(the average thermal energy per nucleon) to the value of
the total potential energy per particle,
1X
Vi =

a constant at large distances. Let us introduce the notion of precluster wave package, which by definition is
proportional to the square root of the density peak in
coordinate density matrix
|ψcluster (x)|2 ∼ (P (x) − P (x = ∞)) .

Because the asymptotic value at large distances is subtracted, this wave package is by definition well localized.
For the 4 He case, this would be the wave package in
which four nucleons are at freeze-out. When the thermal medium rapidly disappears after that, this precluster wave package evolves further. Its decomposition into
stationary states |Ψn i, with the appropriate phases,
ψcluster (t, x) =

A.

Precluster decay into stationary states

When discussing preclusters we have so far calculated
the thermal density matrix in coordinate space P (x; T );
see, e.g., Figs. 5, 7, and 8. This function typically has
the form of a peak, centered at distances ∼ 1 fm between particles (or hyperdistance ρ ∼ 2 fm) tending to

X
n

j6=i

produced at the location of particle i by all other particles. For four particles there are three terms in the sum,
and even for an unmodified potential at 1 fm distance
3|V (1 fm)| ∼ 100 MeV, comparable to T . For a modified
potential like the one shown by blue line in Fig. 1, the
value is one order of magnitude larger than T . For an increasing number N of particles Vi ∼ (N − 1)/2hV (r)i 
3T /2, and the corresponding Boltzmann factor would
lead to very a strong clustering. Of course, this argument does not hold for very large N with the standard
nuclear potential, because due to its short-range nature,
nucleons start to become blind to those far away from
them. Nevertheless the values of N when this happen increase with the criticality of the potential, as it becomes
more long-ranged.
Potential deviations of the nuclear ratios from the statistical predictions imply that interaction strength V and
T are comparable, in the specific collision energy range.
This is only possible when the distances between nucleons are 1–2 fm/c, which we called “preclusters” [6]. Our
dynamical studies in Ref. [6] have shown that the corresponding correlations can be large, especially if the nuclear forces are modified as expected.
In this section we comment on the differences between
the precluster formation and the final, observable, lightnuclei production. While the former at produced in the
hot regime B  T , where a potential modification of the
nuclear interactions are expected, the later are only observed in a situation with vanishing temperature where
the standard N N potential dominates the nuclear dynamics.

takes a time ∆t ∼ ~/∆E, where ∆E ∼ En+1 − En is
the level spacing. As we will see, for the excited states of
4
He this ∆E is of the order of few MeV, so this decomposition takes a long time, much longer than explosion
itself. Therefore, there is no paradox of “fireball creating
objects larger than itself”: the stationary states (with
large sizes) do appear much later in time, basically at
zero density! Furthermore, these states are also unstable
and decay into smaller systems: This also takes a similarly long time ∆t ∼ 1/Γ ∼ 50 fm (see further discussion
in Sec. V C).

B.

On Wigner function projection

If one would like to refine the previous picture, one can
use a more precise procedure. Note that so far we focused
on spatial locations of the nucleons in the precluster, ignoring the momentum distribution. That was possible
because in a thermal state of nonrelativistic particles the
kinetic and potential energy are simply additive, and momenta distributions are just Maxwell-Boltzmann’s ones
(with the corresponding effective mass for relative motion, Meff ).
The product of this Maxwell distribution and the spatial density matrix should be projected to the Wigner
function of the corresponding stationary states W0 (x, p),
the quantum analog of the phase space distribution,

where x is the relative coordinates and q is relative momenta. Let us also note that for the temperature we
should use the so-called kinetic freeze-out temperature
Tf ∼ 100 MeV. After the stage with Tf , there are—
by definition—effectively no collisions, as witnessed by
mesonic and baryonic p⊥ -spectra well explained by a
convolution of hydrodynamic flow and thermal distributions [32].

The form (34) has only one parameter d, related to
the r.m.s. radius. For the deuteron d = 1.7 fm is usually
used, corresponding to the r.m.s. deuteron radius of 2.1
fm. Furthermore, it was claimed that even dependence
on the specific value of d is rather weak, and that all
what matters is that the phase space volume has the
right magnitude, corresponding to a single state.
We call this approach “oversimplified” because it ignores the fact that wave functions have at least two very
different parts, “in” and “out” of the potential well. Even
the original approach to deuteron, by Bethe [37], via a
rectangular attractive potential well, illuminated clearly
existence of two distinct components of the wave function. An appropriate parametrization should have, at
least, two Gaussians to be somewhat realistic. The “in”
component possesses large momenta related to the potential well depth V , the “out” has large size related to
binding. Since B  V they have different properties and
do not correspond to the single Gaussian. Even larger
difference should be present for multi-nucleon case.

(38)
so it makes sense to compare the square wave function obtained from Walecka potential and this probability density for a Gaussian wave function. We show the comparison in Fig. 13.

C. Possible observation of preclusters and
statistical treatment of nuclear resonances

Preclusters do not have fixed energy, as they are superposition of physical states in certain energy strip
∆E ∼ T . Being left alone, the preclusters decay into
many physical states of the corresponding number of nucleons or light nuclei. In the previous section we focused
on the precluster decay into the ground state. Now we
discuss other decays (which of course dominate in terms
of the total probability).
Let us consider as an example a ppnn precluster. Apart
of forming a single bound state, the α particle or 4 He, it
can also decay into (i) four individual nucleons; (ii) 1+3
channels p + t, n+3 He; (iii) 2+2 channel d + d. The
question then is whether one can experimentally infer
the existence of preclusters by looking at these two-body
channels.
One feature expected would be a peak at small relative
momentum (rapidity). In the invariant mass distribution
(p1 +p2 )2 one also should find low-mass enhancement, related to feed-down from four-nucleon resonances. While
we have not yet derived all of them from quantum mechanics, one can use those which were found experimentally.
In Table I we list such resonances occupying the strip
of energies of width ∆E = 10 MeV above the binding threshold, shown with their quantum numbers and
branching ratios for their decay modes.
Note that already in this strip the resonances are
strongly overlapping, as the decay widths and energy differences are comparable. A growing density of states and
widths above this strip makes their separation/discovery
hard. However, one does not need to find them one-by-

method used to simulate the real-time dynamics of nucleons, was a classical molecular dynamics code. Although for calculations in nuclear matter it was augmented by some phenomenological “Fermi potential” to
mimic quantum effects, it was clear that a more quantitative study of few-body quantum mechanics was needed,
as is indeed explored in the present paper.
Before we come to their description, let us recall the
main finding of Ref. [6]. It was shown that the clustering
phenomenon and its rate are extremely sensitive to even
small modifications of the internucleon potential. The
observable on which we focused in that paper was the
scaled kurtosis of the (net-)proton multiplicity distribution, which was shown to be substantially increased by a
reduction of the σ-mode mass.
Let us now come to the results of this paper, aiming
first at experiment-oriented readers. The available data
on Nt Np /Nd2 ratio versus the collision energy, shown in
Fig. 11, are intriguing. At the highest RHIC energy this
ratio is compatible with the ratio of statistical weights of
a noninteracting gas (unit value on that plot). However,
at lower energies it is about twice larger, perhaps with
one (or two) maximum at certain collision energy. Since
the main Boltzmann factors exp[(µB − mN )/T ] cancel in
the ratio, as well as thermal kinetic energy of four nucleons in numerator and denominator, any deviation from
1 should be assigned to some interaction. In particular, a stronger attraction in the three-nucleon system as
compared to the two-nucleon one would bring this ratio
to values larger than 1. An enhanced production of t is
thus interpreted above as a contribution from preclusters.
If so, then we propose that similar effects, but enhanced, should be observed in other ratios including 4 He
like

i

states in this energy strip are populated equally in the
quantum decomposition of preclusters which in our classical simulation have corresponding energies. With this
assumption, and using the decays indicated in the table
(interpreted as p + t, n+3 He, d + d exclusive channels),
one further finds that decays of a single ppnn precluster should produce, on average, 0.30 (p + tritium), 0.22
(n + 3 He) and 0.96 deuterons (0.48 dd pairs). Detector
resolution permitting, one should search for evidences of
these p+t, d+d resonances in heavy-ion datasets. In particular, these evidences can only show up in the nuclear
ratios we have been considering, as this “feed-down” is
just a tiny effect in the absolute yields of nuclei. Should
such “feed down” be found, it would obviously be a direct
evidence for the four-nucleon preclustering we advocate
in this work.

The main object of this study, the four-nucleon
preclusters, were found to be very interesting, even for
the unmodified T = 0 nuclear forces. Out of ∼ 50
bound states, only one—the ground state—is the observable 4 He. All others have known decay channels as listed
in Table I. We suggest that feed-down from them is also
part of the reason for the enhanced t production at low
RHIC energies. One should study this suggestion experimentally, looking for explicit two-body decay channels
of preclusters, as an enhancement at low invariant mass
in, say p + t, d + d channels. We also propose that the
precluster decay into four protons is contributing to the
enhanced kurtosis of the net-proton multiplicity distribution.
Now we turn to summary for readers interested in
many-body theory. Among the goals of this paper are:
(i) development of a novel semiclassical method for finite temperature density matrix, based on path integrals, called the thermal flucton;

16
(ii) comparing its results with classical Boltzmann distribution at high temperature, and with quantum
ground state wave functions at low T ;
(iii) obtaining reliable estimates for precluster decay
probabilities into d for two nucleons, and 4 He for
four nucleons;
(iv) obtaining estimates for two-body precluster decays,
such as ppnn → p + t, n+3 He, and d + d.
We used first a (rather traditional) method to calculate
the density matrix for four-nucleon system, via solving
the Schrödinger equation for multiple energy levels, and
weighting them by the Boltzmann factor. We did so for
the two-nucleon system with a Serot-Walecka potential,
and using the K-harmonics method for four nucleons.
The results, shown in Fig. 5, show a modest ∼ 1.4 correlation for the unmodified potential, but ∼ 10 enhancement for the modified one with increased attraction.
A part of this paper is devoted to the methodical development of the semiclassical “flucton” method [15], so
far developed for T = 0 only [20, 21]. We have shown
how to use it for nonzero temperatures. It does work
well for standard toy models such as the anharmonic oscillator (see Fig. 16), and it is also applicable to two- and
four-nucleon problem at finite temperatures. The flucton method (see Fig. 8) predicts somewhat larger effects
than K-harmonics do, ∼ 4 for the unmodified potential,
and really huge enhancement for the modified one. The
difference may be related to the fact that we only calculated the leading semiclassical part of the four-nucleon
density matrix, exp(−Sflucton ), without the one-loop preexponent (determinant) or other corrections. It may also
indicate that the action is not large enough to fully trust
the semi classical approach.
Note added in proof: The large kurtosis at the lowest energy central Au+Au collisions observed by STAR
collaboration (which triggered our study of four-nucleon
systems) was recently also observed by the HADES col√
laboration [40] at even lower energy sN N = 2.4 GeV.
The feed-down from four-nucleon resonances, that we
suggested in this paper, has been applied in Ref. [41]
using a new statistical-thermal model, improving the description of HADES hadron production data.

Appendix A: Wave function of 4 He using
K-harmonics

The so-called method of K-harmonics was developed
in Ref. [13]. Its main idea is that the multi-dimensional
Schrödinger equation can be treated with a single “radial” coordinate plus “angular variables”, for which a
complete set of functions is known. In certain cases a
rather good approximation can be obtained using a single lowest angular function, with trivial angular dependence. Such cases include in particular A = 3 nuclei and
also 4 He, which is the case we will discuss here following
Ref. [14]. Since these papers are rather old, we indicate
in this Appendix their main points.
As a preliminary information, let us note that 4 He is
a surprisingly compact nucleus, with a r.m.s. radius of
only R(4 He) ≈ 1.6 fm. Its binding energy may appear
to be large B(4 He) = 28.3 MeV, but since there are six
nucleon pairs the “binding per pair” is rather small and
only about twice that of the deuteron.
The first standard step in many-body physics is the
separation of the center of mass motion from the relative
coordinates. It is usually done using Jacobi coordinates,
which for the A = 4 case are

FIG. 14. W (ρ) and Veff (ρ) potentials used in Ref. [14] for the
solution of Eq. (A5). The second potential is also used in the
semiclassical solution in Sec. III D using the flucton path.

For the application of the problem Eq. (A5) into the
semiclassical flucton solution, it is easy to realize that it
is equivalent to a 1D Schrödinger equation,

Therefore we can apply the standard flucton method
described in the text to obtain the flucton solution to
the inverted potential −Veff (ρ). The potentials W (ρ)
and Veff (ρ), for the special case of the N N potential in
Eq. (A7), are plotted in Fig. 14.

The classical flucton path is therefore given by

(B5)

and at both τ = 0 and τ = β it returns to the desired
point x0 . Now, substituting this solution into the Euclidean action one finds that

with the effective potential,
Veff (ρ) = W (ρ) +

that it is defined on a Matsubara circle. Note that the
sign of the potential in the action is reversed, which is
the consequence of i2 = −1 in the kinetic term.
The flucton is a classical path which: (i) passes
through some observational point x0 ; and (ii) is periodic
with the period β in τ . At zero temperature, because in
Euclidean time the potential is inverted, the particle is
“sliding” from the maximum at τ = 0 to τ = ±∞. Most
of the previous applications were at T = 0 (β = ∞) and
the slide was always started from the maximum, at zero
energy.
At nonzero T such slides also start with zero velocity
but from a certain “turning point” xturn and proceed
toward the observational point x0 . The turning point,
by symmetry, should be separated from x0 by the time
equal to half period β/2. For any one-dimensional motion
there is no need to use the Newton’s equation of motion.
Expressing the velocity from the energy conservation on
the path, this condition can be put into the general form

This reproduces the result obtained by Feynman [12] via
the explicit calculation of the Gaussian path integral. As
it happens for any Gaussian path integral, this semiclassical formula is, in fact, exact.

problem, the anharmonic oscillator, defined by

The tactics used in the previous example are not easy to
implement: in particular, the period condition Eq. (B2)

18
defining the energy E needs to be solved numerically for
each value of the x0 . Furthermore, using energy conservation leads naturally to τ (x) representation of the path,
rather than the conventional x(τ ).
After trying several strategies we concluded that the
simplest way to solve the problem is:

T = 1 (in units of the mass). We choose the observation
point x0 = 2, which is reached as expected, at τ = 0 (cf.
Fig. 6). The flucton is periodic in τ with period β = 1/T .

(iii) calculate the corresponding action and double it,
to account for the other half period τ ∈ (0, β/2).
Notice that this method provides x0 as an output after solving the equations of motion with initial conditions
x(−β/2) = xturn and ẋ(−β/2) = 0. One could also tweak
a bit the method to use x0 it as an input by using the
constraints x(0) = x0 and ẋ(−β/2) = 0. The details of
this procedure and its comparison with the numerical results based on the definition Eq. (2) for the anharmonic
oscillator will be provided in a separate methodical paper [23].

point x0 = 2. Notice that, as expected, τ ∈ (−β/2, β/2) with
β = 1/T = 1 and x(τ = 0) = x0 .

In Fig. 15 we show the numerical solution of the flucton path for the anharmonic oscillator with g = 1 and

Here we present the upper panel of Fig. 16 comparing the summation over 60 squared wave functions, and
Boltzmann weighted (solid line), with the result of the
flucton method (points) at T = 1 (in units of the mass).
The coupling is set to g = 1. For additional comparison we also present the numerical results of a path integral Monte Carlo calculation with the same parameters
which simulates quantum paths of one particle in the anharmonic oscillator potential. The method is inspired
by the nice reference Ref. [39] and will be reviewed in
Ref. [23].
As a semiclassical approach one expects that the fluc-

19
ton solution works better when the action is large, i.e. for
large values of x0 . However, one observes that the flucton systematically overestimates the solution based on
the Schrödinger solution. Part of the discrepancy comes
from normalization issues as described in [21]. To remove
those it is enough to compare the logarithmic derivative

of the density matrix d log P (x0 )/dx0 . In the bottom
panel of Fig. 16 we show the logarithmic derivative of
the density matrix in linear scale. While the agreement
is nearly perfect, a small difference can still be detected.
We ascribe it to the loop corrections of the thermal flucton solution [21].
