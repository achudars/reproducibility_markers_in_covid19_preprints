Our understanding of the dynamics and the phase structure of dense strong-interaction matter is
to a large extent still built on the analysis of low-energy models, such as those of the Nambu–JonaLasinio-type. In this work, we analyze the emergence of the latter class of models at intermediate
and low energy scales from fundamental quark-gluon interactions. To this end, we study the renormalization group flow of a Fierz-complete set of four-quark interactions and monitor their strength
at finite temperature and quark chemical potential. At small quark chemical potential, we find that
the scalar-pseudoscalar interaction channel is dynamically rendered most dominant by the gauge
degrees of freedom, indicating the formation of a chiral condensate. Moreover, the inclusion of
quark-gluon interactions leaves a significant imprint on the dynamics as measured by the curvature of the finite-temperature phase boundary which we find to be in accordance with lattice QCD
results. At large quark chemical potential, we then observe that the dominance pattern of the fourquark couplings is changed by the underlying quark-gluon dynamics, without any fine-tuning of the
four-quark couplings. In this regime, the scalar-pseudoscalar interaction channel becomes subleading and the dominance pattern suggests the formation of a chirally symmetric diquark condensate.
In particular, our study confirms the importance of explicit UA (1) breaking for the formation of this
type of condensate at high densities.

INTRODUCTION

Low-energy models of the theory of the strong interaction (Quantumchromodynamics, QCD) are still considered very valuable for a variety of reasons. In particular
in the high-density regime, which is at least difficult to
access with lattice Monte Carlo techniques, the Nambu–
Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model [1, 2] and its various variations
and relatives (see, e.g., Refs. [3–8] for reviews), such as
quark-meson (QM) models, allow us to gain some insight
into the plethora of symmetry breaking patterns that
may potentially be realized in this regime, see Refs. [9–12]
for reviews. From a phenomenological point of view, this
regime attracts significant interest from the astrophysics
side. For example, studies of neutron stars require a
knowledge of the equation of state of strong-interaction
matter as input. However, the latter are currently still
plagued by (significant) uncertainties at least at high density, see, e.g., Ref. [13] for a recent review. In order to
constrain the equation of state further [14], we eventually
need a better understanding of the symmetry breaking
patterns of QCD guided by first-principle approaches.
In two preceding works [15, 16], we have studied
the relevance of Fierz completeness of four-quark selfinteractions in NJL-type models at finite temperature
and quark chemical potential. Our beyond mean-field
renormalization-group (RG) analysis of the “hierarchy”
of the various interaction channels in terms of their relative strengths allowed us to gain insight into the symmetry breaking patterns and the structure of the ground
state. Particularly at high density, we found the aspect of
Fierz completeness to be of great importance, leading to
an increased phase transition temperature as compared
to conventional NJL model studies. At least naively, this
observation might have crucial implications for the prop-

erties of cold dense quark matter at low temperatures as
an increase of the critical temperature may point to an
increase of the size of the gap in the low-energy spectrum.
The four-quark couplings appearing in the ansatz of
NJL-type models are usually considered as fundamental
parameters. In fact, owing to the non-renormalizability
of NJL-type models in four space-time dimensions, both
on the perturbative as well as on the non-perturbative
level (see, e.g., Refs. [17, 18]), the ultraviolet (UV) cutoff
scale Λ becomes a parameter of the model, too. Against
this background, the regularization scheme becomes also
part of the definition of the model. The initial values
of the four-quark couplings are then chosen such that
a given set of low-energy observables is reproduced in
the vacuum limit. In Ref. [16], guided by the findings
of RG studies of QCD [19–21] and in order to relate to
conventional NJL model studies, we have set all fourquark couplings to zero initially, except for the scalarpseudoscalar coupling. As the only remaining parameter,
we adjusted this coupling to fix low-energy observables
in the vacuum limit. However, this scale fixing procedure underlying many low-energy model studies can be
potentially problematic. The distinct role of the scalarpseudoscalar interaction channel at the initial UV cutoff
scale can be indeed questioned since a specific four-quark
interaction channel is reducible by means of Fierz transformations. Yet adopting more complex initial conditions
by also taking into account four-quark couplings other
than the scalar-pseudoscalar interaction channel may suffer from the fact that the parameters cannot be uniquely
determined by a given set of low-energy observables. Indeed, the values of the low-energy observables may in
general be reproduced by various different parameter sets
or certain parameters might be even left undetermined
at all. The remaining ambiguity has been found to affect

2
the phase structure significantly, see, e.g., Refs. [9, 22–
24]. Moreover, boundary conditions which are defined
in the vacuum limit are possibly inappropriate for computations at finite external control parameters, such as
temperature T and/or quark chemical potential µ. Considering NJL-type models to be rooted in QCD, the RG
evolution of gluon-induced four-quark interactions in fact
suggests a dependence of these model parameters on external control parameters [25]. In particular at finite
quark chemical potential, as also discussed in detail in
Refs. [15, 16] (see, e.g., Refs. [9, 11, 12, 26] for reviews),
effective degrees of freedom associated with four-quark
interaction channels other than the scalar-pseudoscalar
interaction channel are expected to become important or
even dominant. In such a situation, a choice for the initial
conditions with a specifically tuned scalar-pseudoscalar
coupling is therefore unfortunate as it may potentially
bias the outcome in terms of symmetry breaking patterns
along the finite-temperature phase boundary.
Thus far, we have not yet discussed the role of the UV
cutoff scale. In the context of NJL-type models, we have
to deal with the existence of a finite UV extent, i.e., the
cutoff scale Λ is limited by a validity bound which in turn
limits the model’s range of applicability in terms of external parameters. The origin of this bound is actually
twofold: First, NJL-type models eventually become unstable in the UV and develop a Landau pole at a certain
scale. Second, these models have a phenomenological UV
extent beyond which the description of the physics in
terms of the models’ effective fields becomes invalid and
the knowledge of the underlying fundamental dynamics,
i.e., quark-gluon dynamics, is ultimately required. As
a consequence, a choice of the UV cutoff scale within
the a priori unknown validity bound either limits the
applicable range of external parameters or, for external
parameters outside of this range, implies that the initial
effective action is already a complicated object itself, see
Ref. [27] for a detailed discussion of these issues. Considering NJL-type models to be embedded in QCD, a possibility to resolve this problem is the determination of the
model parameters by employing RG studies of the fundamental theory, see, e.g., Refs. [25, 28, 29]. In the past
20 years, tremendous progress has been made within the
functional RG framework in the development of a “topdown” approach to QCD, see, e.g., Refs. [20, 21, 30–
50]. The only input in such an approach is given by
the fundamental parameters of QCD, i.e., the current
quark masses and the value of the strong coupling in
the perturbative high-momentum regime. These functional RG studies are basically free of additional model
parameters. In this context, even very good quantitative
agreement of results from lattice QCD and functional RG
studies has been demonstrated at zero and finite temperature for QCD with different flavor numbers, see, e.g.,
Refs. [21, 35, 37, 38, 50].
Whereas the aforementioned RG studies aiming at
quantitative precision constitute essential advances towards predictive first-principle investigations of the QCD

phase diagram, eventually even at high densities, we aim
to take another important step toward such a top-down
first-principle approach to analyze the phase structure of
QCD at high densities with functional methods. With
our analysis of the Fierz -complete NJL model with two
quark flavors in Ref. [16], we have gained valuable insight
into the quark dynamics. In the present work, we now incorporate gluodynamics by extending our Fierz -complete
ansatz with dynamical gauge degrees of freedom, following earlier functional RG studies [36, 37, 39, 45]. In full
QCD, the values of the four-quark couplings are no longer
fundamental parameters since these self-interactions are
fluctuation-induced by the dynamics of the gauge fields.
Taking this aspect into account, the aforementioned issue associated with the determination of model parameters – such as ambiguities related to the possibility to
Fierz -transform given initial conditions and the potential existence of more than one parameter set reproducing equally well a given set of low-energy observables,
or the dependence of the initial conditions on external
control parameters – can in principle be resolved. More
specifically, including gauge dynamics and thus resolving
the fundamental microscopic degrees of freedom allows
the initialization of the RG flow at a large scale Λ associated with the perturbative regime, which effectively corresponds to starting in the vacuum as we have T /Λ  1
and µ/Λ  1. In this way, the finite UV extent as implied
by the validity bound of NJL-type models is surmounted
and the limit on the range of applicability in terms of
external parameters is lifted.
Working in the chiral limit, the strong coupling gs
is the only parameter which is set at a the initial UV
scale Λ. By integrating out fluctuations from this scale Λ
on, the quark-gluon vertex gives rise to 1PI box diagrams with two-gluon exchange which dynamically generate the four-quark interaction channels. Depending on
the strength of the strong coupling and the external parameters, the quark sector may then be driven to criticality, signaling the onset of spontaneous symmetry breaking, e.g., chiral symmetry breaking or diquark condensation of a specific type. Following the approach developed
in our two preceding works [15, 16], we shall consider the
RG flow of the four-quark couplings in the pointlike limit
to study the QCD phase structure at finite temperature
and quark chemical potential. In particular, we analyze
the “hierarchy” of the four-quark couplings in terms of
their strength which shall prove very valuable in order
to gain insight into the symmetry properties of the QCD
ground state in the low-energy limit.
This work is organized as follows: In Sec. II, we discuss
general aspects of the formalism and concepts underlying our study. We begin with a discussion of the relation
of the quark-gluon vertex and four-quark interactions in
Subsec. II A. In Subsec. II B, we then briefly review the
relation of the RG flow of four-fermion couplings to the
onset of phase transitions, including a discussion of the
general structure of the RG flow equations for the fourquark couplings. The scale fixing procedure underlying

3
our present work is discussed in Subsec. II C. The QCD
phase structure and symmetry breaking patterns at finite
temperature and density are then analyzed in Sec. III.
There, we also compare the results for the phase boundary to the one obtained from our previous Fierz -complete
NJL model study [16]. Moreover, we discuss the effect of
explicit UA (1) symmetry breaking and comment on the
curvature of the finite-temperature phase boundary at
small chemical potential resulting from various different
approaches. Our conclusions can be found in Sec. IV.

GENERAL ASPECTS OF THE FORMALISM

A.

Quark-gluon vertex and four-quark interactions

In the present work, we employ the functional RG approach [51] to study the RG flow of QCD starting from
the Euclidean QCD action (see Refs. [17, 52, 53] for reviews):

We emphasize that we exclusively consider the case of
quarks coming in Nc = 3 colors and Nf = 2 flavors.
In the RG flow, the quark-gluon vertex generates quark
self-interactions already at the one-loop level via twogluon exchange. This gives rise to contributions to the
quantum effective action, e.g., of the following form:

where the elements Lj form a ten-component Fierzcomplete basis B of pointlike four-quark interactions to
be specified below. The various terms are associated with
corresponding bare couplings λ̄i and vertex renormalization factors Zj . By construction, the couplings are not
parameters of our calculation but solely generated by
quark-gluon dynamics. This is an important difference
to, e.g., NJL-type model studies where such couplings
represent input parameters.
In the following, we focus on the RG flow of pointlike projected four-quark correlation functions Γ(4) which
eventually corresponds to a calculation of the effective
action at leading order of the derivative expansion. To
be specific, we define the four-quark couplings associated
with the vertex of the form (2) as follows

Here, α, β, γ, δ denote collective indices for color, flavor, and Dirac structures determined by a specific element Lj of our Fierz -complete basis. We add that this

zero-momentum projection does not represent a SilverBlaze-symmetric point [15, 54, 55]. However, it matches
the standard definition of four-quark couplings in conventional low-energy models (see Refs. [3, 4, 9, 10, 56] for
reviews) and BCS-type models (see Refs. [11, 12, 26, 57]
for reviews).
Let us now specify the elements Lj of our Fierzcomplete basis B of pointlike four-quark interactions.
Since Poincaré invariance is explicitly broken in our
calculations at finite temperature and quark chemical
potential, we are only left with rotational invariance
among the spatial components of the various possible
channels. Moreover, a finite quark chemical potential
also explicitly breaks the charge conjugation symmetry. Therefore, with respect to the fundamental symmetries associated with charge conjugation, time reversal, and parity, only invariance under parity transformations and time reversal transformations remain intact. Assuming finally invariance of the channels under SU (Nc ) ⊗ SUL (2) ⊗ SUR (2) ⊗ UV (1), we end up with
a Fierz -complete basis composed of ten elements [16].
Guided by QCD low-energy phenomenology, we choose
four of the ten channels such that they are invariant under SU (Nc ) ⊗ SUL (2) ⊗ SUR (2) ⊗ UV (1) transformations
but break the UA (1) symmetry explicitly:

where, e.g., ψ̄γ5 τi ψ

introduced charge conjugated fields ψ C = C ψ̄ T and
ψ̄ C = ψ T C with C = iγ2 γ0 being related to the charge
conjugation operator. The remaining six channels can
then be chosen to be even invariant under SU (Nc ) ⊗
SUL (2) ⊗ SUR (2) ⊗ UV (1) ⊗ UA (1) transformations:

Of course, this basis is not unique. In principle, we can
combine elements of the basis to perform a basis transformation. However, as indicated above, our present choice
is motivated by the structure of the four-quark channels
conventionally employed in QCD low-energy models. In

4
fact, the scalar-pseudoscalar channel associated with pion
dynamics and chiral symmetry breaking is given by the
channel L(σ-π) . The channel associated with the element
L(S+P )− can be rewritten as (up to a numerical constant)


∼ det ψ̄(1 + γ5 )ψ + det ψ̄(1 − γ5 )ψ ,
(14)
where the determinant is taken in flavor space. This
channel is associated with the presence of topologically
non-trivial gauge configurations violating the UA (1) symmetry. Indeed, such configurations can be recast into a
four-quark interaction channel of the form (14) in the
case of two-flavor QCD [58–64]. The channel (7) may
be viewed as a version of the channel L(S+P )− with a
non-trivial color structure. We add that, for the phenomenologically more relevant three-flavor case, the explicit breaking of the UA (1) symmetry has been suggested
already before the two-flavor case in order to explain the
mass splitting of the η and η 0 in the mesonic mass spectrum [65, 66].
Finally, we have included a channel which allows us
to “measure” the status of the formation of a diquark
condensate of the type
δ a ∼ hiψ̄ C γ5 f εac ψi ,

(15)

which carries a net baryon and net color charge.1 Note
that the channel Lcsc is invariant under SU (Nc ) ⊗
SUL (2) ⊗ SUR (2) ⊗ UV (1) transformations and the corresponding condensate leaves the chiral symmetry intact.
However, the formation of such a diquark condensate
comes along with the breakdown of the UV (1) symmetry, as expected for a BCS-type condensate.2
With respect to our discussion of the effect of UA (1)
symmetry breaking, we add that we can use our Fierzcomplete set of pointlike four-quark interactions to monitor the strength of UA (1) symmetry breaking. Indeed,
requiring that the effective action Γ is invariant under UA (1) transformations, we find the following two sum
rules which are satisfied simultaneously if the UA (1) symmetry is intact:

see Ref. [16] for a more detailed discussion. We shall
come back to the issue of UA (1) symmetry breaking in
Subsec. III B.
To summarize, from here on, we shall consider the RG
flow of pointlike four-quark interactions as generated by

With respect to the diquark channel, we add that our conventions

generators of the SU (Nc ) color group. Normalization factors of
this channel are chosen according to the standard literature [9].

the quark-gluon vertex. The latter implies that the initial conditions of the four-quark interactions are set to
zero at the initial RG scale Λ, i.e., they do not represent parameters of our study as it is the case for QCD
low-energy models. We emphasize again that our set of
four-quark interactions is Fierz -complete, i.e., any other
pointlike four-quark interaction invariant under the symmetries specified above is reducible by means of Fierz
transformations.
Since we consider the RG flow of the four-quark interactions at leading order of the derivative expansion
(i.e., in the pointlike limit as indicated above), the quark
wave-function renormalization factors do not receive contributions directly from the four-quark interactions, see
Ref. [17] for a detailed discussion. Contributions to the
quark wave-function renormalizations resulting from the
coupling of the quarks to the gluons have been found to
be small at this order in earlier studies [32, 35, 39], at
least for RG scales relevant for the present work. Therefore, we do not take into account the running of the quark
wave-function renormalization factors and defer it to future work. Finally, we note that quark self-interactions
of higher order are also generated dynamically in the RG
flow. However, at leading order of the derivative expansion, they do not contribute to the RG flow of the fourquark self-interactions and are thus not included in our
present study. In any case, since the RG flow equations
of the four-quark couplings depend on the strong coupling, we also need to take into account the running of
the strong coupling which we shall discuss below.

B.

Phase transitions and four-quark interactions

The four-quark couplings depend on the chemical potential, the temperature, and the RG scale k. Although
the scale dependence implies that part of the information on the momentum dependence is still taken into account in our RG analysis in an effective manner [67], the
pointlike approximation underlying our present work ignores relevant information of four-quark correlation functions. To be more specific, bound-state information is
encoded in the momentum structure of the quark correlation functions. Therefore, our present approximation only allows us to study the symmetric high-energy
regime [17] whereas the low-energy regime is only accessible in the absence of (spontaneous) symmetry breaking
which is associated with bound-state formation, as it is
the case at, e.g., high temperature. For our purposes, this
is nevertheless sufficient as it enables us to study the approach towards the symmetry-broken low-energy regime.
Indeed, symmetry breaking is ultimately triggered by a
specific four-quark channel approaching criticality as indicated by a divergence of the corresponding coupling.
Such a seeming Landau-pole-type behavior of four-quark
couplings can be traced back to the formation of condensates since the pointlike four-quark couplings can be
shown to be proportional to the inverse mass parame-

5
ters of a generalized Ginzburg-Landau effective potential
for the order parameters in a (partially) bosonized formulation [17, 68, 69]. Thus, if the size of all four-quark
couplings is found to be bounded in the RG flow, the
system remains in the symmetric regime [17, 35–37, 67].
The observation of a divergent four-quark coupling for
a given temperature and quark chemical potential may
therefore be considered as an indicator that the orderparameter potential develops a non-zero ground-state expectation value in the direction associated with a specific
four-quark channel. The critical temperature Tcr (µ) at a
given value of the quark chemical potential above which
no spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs is then defined
as the smallest temperature for which the four-quark couplings still remain finite in the infrared (IR) limit associated with k → 0 [15–17, 36, 37]. However, we emphasize
that our present approach is only able to detect phase
transitions of second order as the definition of the critical temperature is associated with a change from positive
to negative curvature of the order parameter potential at
the origin. In case of a first-order phase transition, a
non-trivial minimum of the potential is formed but the
curvature at the origin remains positive. Consequently,
our criterion for the detection of a phase transition does
not allow to detect first-order transitions. Still, it allows
us to detect the line of metastability [15], see for the first
NJL model analysis of this aspect [70]. In any case, the
nontrivial assumption entering our analysis of the QCD
phase structure in the present work is that it is possible to
relate the dominance pattern of the four-quark couplings
to the symmetry-breaking pattern in terms of condensates, see Refs. [15, 16, 67, 71] for a detailed discussion
of this aspect.
It is reasonable to expect that the symmetry-breaking
patterns associated with the various four-quark channels
change when we vary, e.g., the quark chemical potential.
For example, the diquark channel may become more relevant than the scalar-pseudoscalar channel at high density.
The most dominant channel can be identified by requiring that the modulus of the coupling of this channel is
greater than the ones of all the other four-quark couplings. For such an analysis to be meaningful, it is therefore ultimately required to consider a Fierz -complete set
of four-quark couplings.
For the derivation of the RG flow equations of the fourquark couplings, we employ the Wetterich equation [51]
which is an RG equation for the quantum effective action Γ. Within this framework, the effective action Γ depends on the RG scale k which is related to the so-called
RG “time” t = ln(k/Λ). Note that the scale k defines an
infrared (IR) cutoff scale and Λ may be chosen to be the
scale at which we fix the initial conditions of the RG flow
of the couplings. The general structure of the RG flow
equations for the dimensionless renormalized couplings
λi = Zi k 2 λ̄i is given by

Figure 1. 1PI diagrams contributing to the RG flow (18) of
the four-quark couplings λi . Note that there are two classes
of each diagram which are associated with the signs of the
quark chemical potential appearing in the quark propagators:
one class represents the case of equal signs as depicted by the
blue labels and the other one represents the case of opposite
signs as depicted by the red labels.

with τ = T /k and µ̃τ = µ/(2πT ). The temperature- and
(i)
(i)
chemical-potential-dependent coefficients Amn , Bj and
C (i) are auxiliary functions containing sums of the 1PI
diagrams depicted in Fig. 1. In addition, these functions
also contain the information on the chosen gauge. For
convenience, we shall restrict ourselves to Feynman gauge
in the following. In Eq. (18), terms bilinear in the four(i)
quark couplings with the coefficients Amn are associated
with the purely fermionic diagrams (a) in Fig. 1. Terms
proportional to λj gs2 are generated by the triangle diagrams (b) depicted in Fig. 1. Finally, terms proportional
to gs4 are associated with the box diagrams (c) shown in
Fig. 1. We add that we have dropped an explicit dependence of these loop diagrams on the anomalous dimensions of the quark and gluon fields as these additional
contributions have been found to be subleading in the
symmetric regime [32, 35–37, 72].
For the derivation of the set of RG flow equations (18),
we have made extensive use of existing software packages [73, 74]. Because of the size of the resulting system
of equations for the Fierz -complete set of four-quark couplings, we dealt with the flow equations only numerically
and therefore refrain from listing these equations explicitly here. An explicit representation of the flow equations
for the purely fermionic part as parameterized by the
(i)
matrices Amn can be found in our preceding work [16],
including a discussion of the regularization scheme also
underlying our present work. For the same regularization
scheme, an explicit representation of a Fierz -complete
set of flow equations for the four-quark interactions in
the vacuum limit in case of an SU (Nc ) ⊗ UL (2) ⊗ UR (2)
symmetry can be found in Ref. [35], where the contributions proportional to λj gs2 and gs4 have been taken into
account as well.
In our present approximation, the RG flow of the gauge
sector enters the flow equations of the four-quark couplings only via the running of the strong coupling. In
our numerical analysis in Sec. III, we employ the running
coupling computed non-perturbatively in Refs. [36, 37]
where the same regularization scheme has been used as
in the present work. Let us be more explicit at this point.
In Refs. [36, 37], the running of the gauge coupling has

1

6
been computed at zero and finite temperature, but not
at finite quark chemical potential. An extension of these
non-perturbative studies to finite quark chemical potential is beyond the scope of the present work and therefore
deferred to future work. To estimate the effect of a quark
chemical potential on the running of the strong coupling
and thereby on the flow of the four-quark couplings, we
employ the running strong coupling from Refs. [36, 37]
as obtained for (pure) Yang-Mills (YM) theory (Nf = 0)
and for QCD with two massless quark flavors. The reason
behind is that, at the one-loop level, the quark contribution to the β function of the strong coupling at finite
quark chemical potential and zero temperature has been
found to be identical to the one in the vacuum limit for
RG scales k ≥ µ and to vanish identically for k < µ,
see, e.g., Refs. [41, 50, 75]. This implies that, at least
at the one-loop level at zero temperature, the RG flow
of the strong coupling is identical to the one in the vacuum limit for k ≥ µ but identical to the one in YM
theory for k < µ. Loosely speaking, the YM coupling
and the QCD coupling in the vacuum limit may therefore be viewed as two extremes of the zero-temperature
QCD coupling at finite quark chemical potential. The
stepwise change of the β function of the strong coupling
at k = µ is then smeared out at finite temperature.
In addition to corrections to the strong coupling originating from the presence of a finite quark chemical
potential, one may be worried about possible corrections to the strong coupling arising from the presence
of quark self-interactions. However, provided the flow
of the four-quark couplings is governed by the presence
of fixed points [72], as it is the case in the symmetric
regime [35–37], it follows from the analysis of (modified)
Ward -Takahashi identities that the back-reaction of the
four-quark couplings on the strong coupling is negligible.
For our present analysis, the use of the strong coupling
from Refs. [36, 37] in our set of flow equations for the
four-quark couplings is therefore not only a convenient
but also a consistent approximation.
We close this discussion by adding that the mechanism underlying the dynamical generation of the fourquark couplings and the role of the running gauge coupling for spontaneous symmetry breaking can be already
understood in simple terms by analyzing analytically the
fixed-point structure of the RG flow equations for the
four-quark couplings. Here, we refrain from repeating
this general line of arguments and only refer the reader to
the discussions given in Refs. [35–37, 76–78], see Ref. [17]
for an introduction.

Scale-fixing procedure

As already mentioned above, the initial values of the
four-quark interaction channels are not considered as fundamental parameters in our present approach and are set
to zero at the UV scale Λ. This corresponds to a UA (1)symmetric scenario according to the sum rules (16)

and (17). The case with explicit UA (1)-symmetry breaking is discussed separately in Subsec. III B. In any case,
the four-quark couplings must be generated dynamically
by quark-gluon interactions which removes a potential
bias in the parameter choice as present in low-energy
model studies. In fact, within our present study, we
rather predict the values of the four-quark couplings from
the underlying quark-gluon dynamics. This is a feature
that has already been used in Ref. [14] to constrain the
equation of state of symmetric nuclear matter.
The only free parameter in our study is the value of the
running gauge coupling gs at the initial RG scale Λ. This
value is adjusted at the UV scale Λ = 10 GeV to obtain a
critical temperature Tcr (µ = 0) ≡ T0 = 132 MeV at zero
quark chemical potential, being the value of the chiral
phase transition temperature at µ = 0 found in very
recent lattice QCD studies [79].3 In Sec. III, we shall
use the scale T0 as a reference scale, i.e., we “measure”
all physical observables in units of this scale. The chosen
value for Λ ensures that T /Λ  1 and µ/Λ  1 for the
range of external parameters considered in the present
work and therefore allows us to avoid cutoff artefacts
(and to reduce regularization-scheme dependences) [27].
In order to obtain the critical temperature Tcr (µ =
0) = 132 MeV at µ = 0, we tune the running gauge
coupling at the initial scale Λ. For example, for our
study with a gauge coupling with two quark flavors,
this amounts to choosing αs (Λ = 10 GeV) = gs2 /(4π) =
0.2137. Evolved to the Z-boson mass scale MZ =
91.19 GeV, the value of the gauge coupling fixed in this
way is then about 6% greater than the experimental results [80]. The necessity of a larger initial value for
the running gauge coupling in order to trigger criticality in the quark sector has been observed before in
studies employing approximations of the present type,
see, e.g., Ref. [45]. Only most advanced RG truncations with a very accurate treatment of momentum structures do not require such an “enhancement”, see, e.g.,
Refs. [20, 21]. The latter is of particular importance for a
quantitative description of low-energy observables within
the symmetry-broken regime. For our present work aiming at a study of the onset of spontaneous symmetry
breaking and an analysis of symmetry breaking patterns,
we expect that this plays a secondary role.

Figure 2. Phase boundary associated with the spontaneous
breakdown of at least one of the fundamental symmetries of
QCD as accessible by our Fierz -complete ansatz (red and
blue lines). The red line has been obtained by employing a
strong coupling with two massless quark flavors. To illustrate
the effect of quark contributions to the strong coupling, we
also show the phase boundary as obtained when the strong
coupling from pure Yang-Mills theory is employed, see main
text for details. The gray boxes labeled “1” and “2” specify
two exemplarily points for which the RG flows of the fourquark couplings are shown in Fig. 3.

tential for the UA (1)-symmetric case, i.e., with all fourquark couplings set to zero at the initial RG scale Λ. Recall that we have defined the critical temperature Tcr (µ)
at a given value of the quark chemical potential to be
the smallest temperature for which all four-quark couplings still remain finite in the IR limit k → 0 [15–
17, 36, 37]. Keep also in mind that a divergence in the
flow of one four-quark coupling at a critical scale kcr (T, µ)
entails corresponding divergences in all other channels as
well. However, as discussed in detail in Refs. [15, 16],
the four-quark couplings in general develop distinct relative strengths and it is possible to identify a dominant
four-quark channel, i.e., the modulus of the associated
coupling is (significantly) greater than the absolute values of all the other four-quark couplings, see our general
discussion above.
As a first non-trivial result, we observe a dominance
of the scalar-pseudoscalar coupling in the vacuum limit
(T = µ = 0) with the couplings diverging at a symmetry breaking scale kcr (µ = 0)/T0 ≈ 2.62. Close to
the symmetry breaking scale, we find that the modulus
of the scalar-pseudoscalar coupling is at least two times
greater than the modulus of all other couplings, suggesting that the QCD ground state is governed by chiral
symmetry breaking in the vacuum limit. At first glance,
this is very similar to the situation observed in NJL- and
quark-meson-type studies. However, the crucial difference is given by the initial conditions for the four-quark
couplings. In the present case, we can exclude that the
dominance of the scalar-pseudoscalar channel may have
been triggered by the choice for the initial conditions of

the four-quark couplings since they are set to zero at the
initial scale and are therefore only generated dynamically.
Thus, the dominance of the scalar-pseudoscalar coupling
indicating chiral symmetry breaking is solely generated
by quark-gluon dynamics. This is in line with earlier RG
flow studies of QCD in the vacuum limit [19, 20] and it
has indeed been observed that this dominance entails the
formation of a corresponding chiral condensate [20, 21]
governing the low-energy dynamics.
Increasing the temperature at vanishing quark chemical potential, the dominance of the scalar-pseudoscalar
interaction channel persists even up to high temperatures beyond the critical temperature. The red line in
Fig. 2 depicts the critical temperature as a function of the
quark chemical potential which has been obtained with
the running gauge coupling as computed in Refs. [36, 37]
for Nf = 2, here denoted by αQCD . Following the phase
boundary from small to large chemical potential, we first
observe that the dominance of the scalar-pseudoscalar interaction channel persists up to µ/T0 ≈ 1.7 as indicated
by the red solid line. To illustrate the relative strengths of
the various four-quark couplings in this regime, we show
the scale dependence of the (dimensionful) renormalized
couplings at µ/T0 = 1.0 for T /T0 ≈ 0.95 & Tcr (µ)/T0
(i.e., right above the phase transition) in the left panel
of Fig. 3. This point is indicated in the phase diagram
by the little gray box labeled “1”. For illustrational purposes, the various couplings are normalized by the value
of the scalar-pseudoscalar coupling λ̄(σ-π) at k = 0. We
readily observe that the dynamics is clearly dominated
by the scalar-pseudoscalar coupling. In fact, its modulus
is at least two times greater than the modulus of all other
couplings. According to our line of argument, this dominance indicates that in this regime the phase boundary
continues to be governed by chiral symmetry breaking.
Following the phase transition line, we then encounter
that the exclusive dominance of the scalar-pseudoscalar
channel goes away and a small region from approximately
µ/T0 ≈ 1.7 to µ/T0 = µχ /T0 ≈ 2.0 opens up (as depicted by the red dotted line in Fig. 2). In this region, we observe that the scalar-pseudoscalar channel,
adj
the CSC channel, as well as the (S + P )adj
− -, (V + A)k and (V −A)adj
⊥ -channel are most dominant, meaning that
these channels are significantly greater compared to the
remaining interaction channels. Such a region of “mixed”
dominances might potentially indicate a metastable or
mixed phase [71]. It is noteworthy that four out of this set
of five dominant channels are adjoint interaction channels which may point to a non-trivial color-structure of
the ground state in this regime. However, the appearance of this regime may also very well be a consequence
of the UA (1)-preserving initial conditions as the resulting UA (1)-symmetric RG flow affects the development
of dominances. Indeed, the “entanglement” of several
equally strong four-quark couplings is lifted by taking
into account UA (1)-violating effects, see Subsec. III B.
For µ/T0 & 2.0, depicted by the red dashed line in
Fig. 2, we eventually observe a clear dominance of the

scale dependence of the couplings in this region shown in
the right panel of Fig. 3. There, we show the RG flow
for µ/T0 = 4.0 and T /T0 ≈ 0.74 & Tcr (µ)/T0 (i.e., right
above the phase transition). In the phase diagram, the
corresponding point is depicted by the little gray box labeled “2” in Fig. 3. Note that, in the right panel of Fig. 3,
the couplings are now normalized by the modulus of the
dominant CSC coupling, |λ̄csc | at k = 0. We observe that
the modulus of any other four-quark coupling is at most
less than half the value of the CSC coupling, except for
the (S + P )adj
− coupling. The latter assumes the same
value in the IR as the CSC coupling, only with opposite
sign. The reason for this behavior is that the boundary
conditions with all four-quark couplings initially set to
zero at the UV scale Λ leaves the axial UA (1) symmetry intact, as already mentioned above. Since the RG
flow preserves the symmetries of the initial effective average action, the sum rules (16) and (17) are exactly
fulfilled at all scales k, with the first sum rule implying
λ̄csc = −λ̄(S+P )adj . In fact, the sum rules show that two
−
of the 10 four-quark couplings of our Fierz -complete basis are not independent in the UA (1)-symmetric case. We
shall discuss the effect of UA (1)-violating initial discussions in Subsec. III B.
In Fig. 4, we show the dominance pattern of the
four-quark couplings along the finite-temperature phase
boundary presented in Fig. 2 (as obtained with the twoflavor coupling αQCD ). The values of the dimensionful

renormalized couplings are shown for k → 0 as functions of the quark chemical potential for temperatures
right above the critical temperature Tcr (µ), where we
have normalized the couplings by the scalar-pseudoscalar
coupling λ̄(σ-π) for µ = 0 at k = 0 for convenience.
As already mentioned above, we first observe a clear
dominance of the scalar-pseudoscalar interaction channel for µ/T0 . 1.7, followed by a change of the dominance pattern to a dominance of the CSC coupling for
µ/T0 & 2. In the region of CSC dominance, the intact UA (1) symmetry is again encoded by the fact that
the values of the CSC and the (S + P )adj
− -coupling are
identical, up to their signs. The dominance of the CSC
coupling for µ/T0 & 2 is as clearly visible as the dominance of the scalar-pseudoscalar coupling for µ/T0 . 1.7.
In fact, the ratio of the modulus of the second largest
coupling and the largest coupling is even smaller in this
high-density regime. Note that, in Fig. 4, the values
of the four-quark couplings are extracted at a temperature T slightly above the critical temperature Tcr (µ)
where (T − Tcr (µ))/T0 ≈ 0.004. By this, we ensure that
the RG flow is fully located in the symmetric regime and
the flow can be followed down to k = 0. However, owing
to this small distance to the phase transition line, the
aforementioned region with “mixed” dominances is not
fully resolved in this figure.
The distinct dominance and evident “hierarchy”
among the four-quark self-interactions in the low- and
high-density regime is nicely illustrated in Fig. 4. In view
of this result, it is tempting to speculate whether such a

along the phase boundary (i.e., along the red line in Fig. 2).

change in the “hierarchy” points to the existence of a
nearby tricritical point in the phase diagram. Yet, this
aspect is speculative as the presently employed approximations do not allow a definite answer to this question.
However, we emphasize that the change in the “hierarchy” from a dominance of the scalar-pseudoscalar coupling to a dominance of the CSC coupling at µχ /T0 ≈ 2.0
is a non-trivial outcome of our study as it is completely
determined by the dynamics of the system itself. The
four-quark couplings are initially set to zero at the UV
scale Λ and are dynamically generated by quark-gluon
dynamics in the RG flow. Thus, the dynamics is not affected by any kind of fine-tuning of the boundary conditions of the four-quark couplings which would potentially
favor particular channels.
At this point, let us once more bring to attention that
the dominance of a four-quark coupling only indicates
the onset of the formation of an associated condensate.
It does neither guarantee the actual formation (e.g., IR
fluctuations could restore the associated symmetries) nor
does it strictly exclude the possible formation of other
condensates associated with subdominant couplings. Our
analysis based on the dominance pattern of the fourquark couplings must therefore be taken with some care,
see also our discussion in our preceding works [15, 16].
Still, in the context of condensed-matter physics, the appearance of a clear dominance of a given channel has been
found to be a precursor of the formation of a corresponding condensate [71].
In Fig. 2, we also included results for the finitetemperature phase boundary from a computation where
we have used a running gauge coupling as obtained in
YM theory (depicted by the blue line labeled αYM ). The

phase boundary as well as the dominances agree almost
perfectly with the results from the computation using
the running coupling αQCD . To be specific, we observe
a dominance of the scalar-pseudoscalar coupling at small
quark chemical potential, a regime characterized by a
“mixed” dominance pattern between 1.7 . µ/T0 . 2.0,
and finally a clear dominance of the CSC coupling at
large quark chemical potential. This is noteworthy since
the YM coupling αYM grows more rapidly than the QCD
coupling αQCD when the scale k is lowered. However,
the effect of this difference in the scale dependence is
also to a certain extent compensated by our scale fixing procedure. The initial value of the YM gauge coupling has to be chosen smaller than for the αQCD coupling in order to obtain the same critical temperature
T0 ≡ Tcr (µ = 0) = 132 MeV at zero quark chemical potential. Nevertheless, this observation may be viewed
as an indication that the “hierarchy” of the various couplings in terms of their relative strength is predominantly
determined by the dynamics within the quark sector
whereas the gauge sector as associated with the details
of the running coupling is mostly required to bring the
quark sector close to criticality in the first place. Once
the gauge sector have rendered the four-quark couplings
sufficiently large, they become relevant operators in the
RG flow and the quarks start to develop their “own effective dynamics”. Then, the details of the gauge sector
play a subleading role, at least in the present approximation. Loosely speaking, one may therefore state that we
are basically left with an NJL-type model once the fourquark couplings have been rendered sufficiently large by
the underlying quark-gluon dynamics.

B.

Role of UA (1) symmetry

The initial conditions of the RG flow chosen so far
leave the axial UA (1) symmetry intact. All couplings of
the four-quark self-interactions are set to zero at the UV
scale Λ and are solely generated dynamically by quarkgluon interactions in the RG flow. In, e.g., Refs. [36, 37],
UA (1)-violating channels have been omitted based on the
assumption that they become relevant only in the lowenergy regime governed by spontaneous symmetry breaking. Our Fierz -complete basis B composed of the 10 fourquark interaction channels is effectively reduced to eight
interaction channels in case of the UA (1) symmetry being intact [16]. Recall that the sum rules (16) and (17)
imply that two of the couplings associated with the four
UA (1)-violating interaction channels of our basis B are
not independent. These sum rules are exactly fulfilled at
all scales in the symmetric phase and for all k > kcr in the
phase governed by spontaneous symmetry breaking. In
the latter case, the UA (1) symmetry may potentially still
be broken spontaneously below the symmetry breaking
scale kcr . However, this cannot be resolved within our
present approximation.

Figure 5. Illustration of the scale dependence of the explicit UA (1) breaking as measured by the normalized sum rules R1
(dashed lines) and R2 (solid lines) at µ = 0 (left panel) and at µ/T0 = 4.0 (right panel) for three values of the temperature
for each of the two cases. The strength of the initial explicit UA (1) symmetry breaking is controlled by the value of the
(dimensionless) renormalized coupling of the (S + P )− -channel (“’t Hooft channel”) at the UV scale Λ, exemplarily chosen to
(UV)
be λ(S+P )− = 1.0 in this figure.

NJL model and the role of Fierz completeness [16], we
have observed that UA (1) symmetry breaking affects
the dominances of the four-quark couplings in terms of
their relative strength along the finite-temperature phase
boundary. In particular, we have found explicit UA (1)
symmetry breaking to be important for the formation of
the conventional CSC ground state at intermediate and
large values of the chemical potential. In this work, the
four-quark couplings are now dynamically generated by
quark-gluon dynamics. Following the critical temperature Tcr (µ) as a function of the quark chemical potential, we observe two regions characterized by different
distinct “hierarchies” of the four-quark couplings which
are remarkably robust against a variation of the running
gauge coupling, see Fig. 2 for the UA (1)-symmetric case.
The scalar-pseudoscalar interaction channel dominates
the dynamics at small quark chemical potential, signaling
the formation of the chiral condensate, whereas at higher
quark chemical potential the dominance of the conventional CSC coupling suggests the formation of a diquark
condensate. The latter is observed in spite of the intact
UA (1) symmetry in our considerations thus far. Only for
1.7 . µ/T0 . 2.0, we observe a regime which is characterized by several equally strong four-quark interaction
channels, see our discussion in the previous subsection.
Moreover, the dominance of the CSC coupling is always
accompanied by an equally strong (S + P )adj
− -channel as
a direct consequence of the intact UA (1) symmetry: The
sum rule (16) ties the modulus of the CSC coupling to
the modulus of the (S + P )adj
− coupling.
In order to probe the role of explicit UA (1)-symmetry
breaking in our present study, we now analyze the RG

flow for UA (1)-violating boundary conditions for the fourquark couplings. The strength of UA (1) breaking is effectively controlled by the initial value of the (S + P )−
coupling since the associated four-quark interaction channel is directly related to the so-called ’t Hooft determinant (14), see Refs. [3, 58–63]. In the following, we therefore vary only the initial condition of this coupling but
still set the initial values of the other four-quark couplings to zero at the UV scale Λ. For a given initial value
of the (S + P )− coupling, we then adjust the UV value
of the gauge coupling gs (Λ) such that the value of the
critical temperature at zero chemical potential remains
unchanged, Tcr (µ = 0) = 132 MeV. This ensures comparability between our results for different initial conditions
for the (S + P )− coupling.
As also done in Refs. [15, 16], we begin by analyzing
the fate of the UA (1) symmetry at finite temperature
and quark chemical potential with the aid of the sum
rules (16) and (17). To this end, we first normalize the
two sum rules as follows:

Figure 6. Phase boundary associated with the spontaneous
breakdown of at least one of the fundamental symmetries of
QCD as accessible by our Fierz -complete ansatz now under
the influence of explicit UA (1) symmetry breaking, in comparison to the phase boundary resulting from a corresponding Fierz -complete NJL model study (black line), see also
Ref. [16]. All results (except for those from the NJL model
study) have been obtained by employing a strong coupling
with two massless quark flavors. The strength of the initial
explicit UA (1) symmetry breaking is controlled by the value
of the (dimensionless) renormalized coupling of the (S + P )−
channel (“’t Hooft channel”) at the UV scale Λ. The values of all other four-quark couplings have been chosen to
be initially zero. The phase boundary is shown for UA (1)symmetric boundary conditions as well as for UA (1)-violating
(UV)
initial conditions with λ(S+P )− = 0.01, 0.1, 1.0 . A dominance of the scalar-pseudoscalar interaction channel is depicted by solid lines and a dominance of the CSC channel
by dashed lines. The case of “mixed” dominances occurring
for UA (1)-symmetric boundary conditions is indicated by a
dotted line although hardly visible on the scale of the plot.

of the two cases. Interestingly, we observe the exact
same qualitative behavior as found in Ref. [16] for the
NJL model. At small quark chemical potential close to
the critical temperature Tcr (µ), UA (1) breaking is driven
by the scalar-pseudoscalar channel associated with pion
dynamics and becomes stronger toward the IR as indicated by increasing values of R1 and R2 , with R2  R1 .
At large chemical potential, we find that the strength
of UA (1)-symmetry breaking becomes also stronger as
the phase boundary is approached from above, but now
driven by the dynamics of diquark degrees of freedom as
associated with the CSC channel. As a consequence, R1
and R2 are of the same order of magnitude since both
depend on the CSC coupling, see Eqs. (16) and (17). In
either case, for increasing temperature, UA (1) breaking
as measured by the sum rules remains more and more
on its initial level as determined by the UA (1)-violating
boundary conditions in the UV regime since quark fluctuations become more and more thermally suppressed.
Let us now compare the phase diagram as obtained
with the UA (1)-symmetric initial conditions employed in
the previous subsection, i.e., with all four-quark cou-

plings initially set to zero, to the phase diagrams resulting
from UA (1)-violating initial conditions. The strength of
the explicit UA (1) breaking at the initial UV scale Λ is
controlled by the value of the (dimensionless) renormalized coupling of the (S + P )− channel (“’t Hooft chan(UV)
nel”) which we choose to assume the values λ(S+P )− =
0.01, 0.1, 1.0 . In the following, we shall only present
results from computations using the running gauge coupling for two massless quark flavors. As in the UA (1)symmetric case, the dependence on our specific choice for
the coupling is found to be very mild anyhow. In Fig. 6,
the various phase diagrams as obtained with these three
different choices for the boundary conditions are shown.
It is remarkable how little the critical phase temperature as a function of the quark chemical potential is affected by the strength of the initial explicit breaking of
the UA (1) symmetry, although the strength in terms of
the initial value of the (S + P )− coupling is varied over
three orders of magnitude.4 Across the entire range of
chemical potentials shown in this figure, the variation of
the critical temperature for any given value of the chemical potential is less than 2%.5 In all cases, we observe
a dominance of the scalar-pseudoscalar coupling at small
quark chemical potential, depicted by the solid lines in
Fig. 6. The regime of “mixed” dominances for chemical potentials between 1.7 . µ/T0 . 2.0 appearing in
case of UA (1)-symmetric initial conditions vanishes for
all considered UA (1)-violating initial conditions. Choos(UV)
ing 0.01 ≤ λ(S+P )− ≤ 1.0 for the initial value of the
coupling associated with the UA (1)-violating (S + P )−
channel, we indeed find that the dominance changes directly from the scalar-pseudoscalar channel to the CSC
channel within the region 1.8 . µχ /T0 . 2.0, as indicated
by the dashed lines in Fig. 6. This is similar to what has
been found in a Fierz -complete NJL-model study [16].
The “hierarchy” of the various four-quark couplings in
terms of their relative strength along the phase boundary is shown in Fig. 7, exemplarily for the initial cou(UV)
pling λ(S+P )− = 1.0. This figure shows again the values
of the (dimensionful) renormalized couplings for k → 0
as functions of the quark chemical potential for temperatures (T − Tcr (µ))/T0 ≈ 0.002 (i.e., slightly above the
critical temperature Tcr (µ) for a given quark chemical
potential µ). The values are normalized by the scalarpseudoscalar coupling λ̄(σ-π) for k → 0 at zero chemical
potential. We again observe a clear dominance of the
scalar-pseudoscalar interaction channel for µ/T0 . 2.0

Note that the considered range of values for the (S+P )− coupling
is consistent with the size of the value that is expected from a
direct computation of this quantity at a given scale Λ [63].
For all initial conditions of the computations shown in Fig. 6, the
symmetry breaking scale in the vacuum limit remains at approximately the same value, kcr /T0 ≈ 2.6. Still, a direct quantitative
comparison of the phase boundaries has to be taken with some
care as the different computations do not necessarily lead to the
same values of low-energy observables.

Figure 7. “Hierarchy” of the four-quark couplings in terms of
their relative strength along the phase boundary (blue line in
Fig. 6). To obtain this figure, we have evaluated the renormalized four-quark couplings for k → 0 as functions of the quark
chemical potential for temperatures (T − Tcr (µ))/T0 ≈ 0.002
(i.e., slightly above the critical temperature Tcr (µ) for a given
quark chemical potential). The values of the four-quark couplings are shown for UA (1)-violating initial conditions with
(UV)
λ(S+P )− = 1.0 for the ’t Hooft coupling. To normalize the
couplings, we have used the scalar-pseudoscalar coupling for
k → 0 and zero quark chemical potential.

and a clear dominance of the CSC interaction channel
for larger values of the chemical potential. Compared
to the case with UA (1)-symmetric boundary conditions
(see Fig. 4), these dominances appear even more pronounced in the present case. In particular, the CSC
channel is not accompanied anymore by an equally strong
(S + P )adj
− coupling. The latter now assumes considerably smaller values for µ/T0 & 2.0 in comparison to the
computation with intact UA (1) symmetry, whereas the
CSC coupling assumes even slightly larger values. From
this, we conclude that the breaking of the UA (1) symmetry plays an important role in “shaping the hierarchy” of the four-quark interaction channels and thus in
the formation of associated condensates as indicated by
their dominances. This observation confirms the importance of explicit UA (1) breaking for the formation of the
conventional CSC ground state at large chemical potential as already discussed in Ref. [16] for NJL-type models. In this respect, we also refer again to early seminal
works on color superconductivity, see, e.g., Refs. [81–90].
Noteworthy, we find that the change in the “hierarchy”
from a dominance of the scalar-pseudoscalar coupling to
a dominance of the CSC coupling at µχ /T0 ≈ 2.0 is
remarkably insensitive to the initial strength of explicit
UA (1) symmetry breaking as controlled by the initial cou(UV)
pling λ(S+P )− associated with the “’t Hooft channel”. We
emphasize that this change in the “hierarchy” of fourquark couplings is a non-trivial outcome completely determined by the dynamics of the system itself.
Let us finally compare our results with those from a
Fierz -complete NJL model study [16]. In Fig. 6, we

also show the finite-temperature phase boundary resulting from a Fierz -complete NJL model study (black line).
The corresponding flow equations have been presented
in Ref. [16]. In this computation, the initial scalarpseudoscalar coupling at the UV scale Λ/T0 ≈ 75.76 has
been tuned such that we obtain Tcr (µ = 0) = 132 MeV
for the critical temperature at µ = 0. The remaining initial four-quark couplings are set to zero. Interestingly, we
find that the finite-temperature phase boundary agrees
well with the one obtained from our present study with
a two-flavor running gauge coupling αQCD , at least for
small quark chemical potential. For µ/T0 & 0.5, however, the two phase boundaries start to deviate from each
other significantly. Indeed, at the largest quark chemical
potential shown in Fig. 6, µ/T0 = 4.4, the critical temperature resulting from the NJL model computation is
Tcr /T0 ≈ 0.366. In contrast to that, at the same quark
chemical potential, the computation including dynamical
gauge fields yields a critical temperature that exceeds
the one from the NJL model study by a factor of two:
Tcr (µ = 4.4 T0 )/T0 ≈ 0.731. This observation may have
further phenomenological consequences. For example, in
standard BCS theory, the critical temperature can be directly related to the size of the diquark gap δ a at zero
temperature, i.e., Tcr ∼ |δ| [26, 57, 91]. Thus, the observed increase of the critical temperature in our results
from the computation including dynamical gauge degrees
of freedom may hint to a larger diquark gap at T = 0.
Recall that we use different initial conditions for the
four-quark couplings in our NJL model study and our
study with dynamical gauge fields. This is required since
different mechanisms are at play which drive the quark
sector to criticality. To be specific, in our NJL model
study, it is required to choose a sufficiently large initial
scalar-pseudoscalar coupling to ensure that the RG flow
diverges at a finite symmetry breaking scale kcr for sufficiently low temperatures, signaling the onset of spontaneous symmetry breaking. Apart from the value of the
coupling associated with the ’t Hooft channel, the fourquark couplings in our QCD study are solely dynamically generated and the quark sector is driven to criticality by the gauge coupling becoming sufficiently large,
see Refs. [17, 35–37] for a detailed discussion of the latter mechanism. Of course, this difference also affects the
results at large quark chemical potential, although the
gauge coupling plays a less prominent role in this regime
as the dynamics is largely controlled by the appearance
of a BCS-type instability. One may argue that the initial
conditions chosen in case of the NJL model study actually
favor the scalar-pseudoscalar coupling and do not sufficiently support the dynamics associated with the formation of a diquark condensate or other channels which may
become relevant at large chemical potential. Indeed, the
boundary conditions enforce that the dynamics are initially driven by the scalar-pseudoscalar self-interaction,
at least over a wide range of RG scales. Still, at large
chemical potential, the CSC channel is found to dominate the dynamics even in case of the NJL model. As dis-

cussed in detail in Refs. [16], this can be understood from
an analysis of the fixed-point structure. Our study taking
into account gauge degrees of freedom comes without the
requirement of an initial tuning of a specific four-quark
coupling. It is therefore intriguing that the “hierarchy”
of the various interaction channels in both computations
changes at approximately the same quark chemical potential from the scalar-pseudoscalar coupling to the CSC
coupling, see Fig. 6. This observation indicates that the
“hierarchy” of the interaction channels in terms of their
strength is determined to a large extent by the interplay
of the various four-quark couplings themselves, see also
our discussion in the previous subsection.
As a closing remark, we would like to add that the
comparison of the different phase boundaries shown in
Figs. 2 and 6 have to be taken with some care. Although all computations yield approximately the same
critical scale kcr /T0 ≈ 2.6 (symmetry-breaking scale) in
the vacuum limit, which sets the scale for low-energy observables O ∼ kcr (see, e.g., Ref. [76]), our present approximation does not allow to check whether the different
studies indeed lead to the same values of low-energy observables in the IR limit. This potential issue complicates
a comparison of our results for the phase boundary, as
well as our subsequent comparison of the curvature of the
phase boundary.

The results for the curvature as obtained from various
different studies are summarized in Tab. I.
Compared to our Fierz -complete NJL model study, we
find the curvature to be significantly decreased in our
study including dynamical gauge degrees of freedom. In
fact, the curvature is reduced by approximately 40%.

The curvature of a standard one-channel NJL-model
study in the mean-field approximation is even more than
four times greater than in our present study with gauge
degrees of freedom. This holds true for all settings with
gauge degrees of freedom considered in this work, including computations using a Yang-Mills coupling, a strong
coupling for the two-flavor case, as well as computations
taking into account explicit UA (1) symmetry breaking
(labelled “fRG (QCD)” in Tab. I). Note that the results from our Fierz -complete fRG calculations including
gauge degrees of freedom listed in Tab. I have been obtained with the strong coupling for the two-flavor case.
For the case with explicit UA (1) symmetry breaking, we
(UV)
have chosen λ(S+P )− = 1.0 for the initial condition of the
coupling associated with the ’t Hooft channel. A summary of results for the curvature from lattice QCD calculations with two flavors can also be found in Tab. I. We
observe that the results from our Fierz -complete studies
taking into account gauge degrees of freedom are well in
accordance with those from lattice QCD studies. We add
that low-energy model studies indicate that the inclusion
of IR fluctuation effects tend to further lower the value of
the curvature [92, 97–99]. For the 2 + 1-flavor case, more
recent lattice results for the curvature are also available,
indicating κ ∼ 0.034 . . . 0.21 [100]. The curvature found
in a very recent 2 + 1-flavor fRG-QCD study with physical masses is also in accord with the latter results [50].
In any case, a direct comparison of our present results
to those from 2 + 1-flavor studies is only possible to a
limited extent, if at all. Still, in general, it is reasonable
to expect from our present study that the issue of Fierz incompleteness also affects the results for the curvature
in the 2 + 1-flavor case, as it does in the 2-flavor case (see
Tab. I). Indeed, it has also been observed in a Fierz incomplete two-channel study of a 2 + 1-flavor NJL-type
model that four-quark interaction channels other than
the scalar-pseudoscalar channel can significantly impact
the value of the curvature [101].

IV.

CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we have analyzed the RG flow of fourquark interactions in the pointlike limit in a Fierz complete fashion starting from the classical QCD action
in the UV limit. Working in the chiral limit, the only
parameter of our study in the UA (1)-symmetric limit is
given by the strong coupling gs which we fixed at a large
initial UV scale in the perturbative regime.
With this setting at hand, we found that the inclusion
of gluodynamics leads to an increase of the critical temperatures at large quark chemical potential in comparison to the results from a corresponding Fierz -complete
NJL model study. Assuming that the critical temperature can be related to the size of the zero-temperature
gap in a color superconducting phase of quark matter,
our results therefore suggest that the diquark gap is likely
to be greater than the one found in corresponding NJL

14
model studies, at least within the range of chemical potentials considered in our present work.
Toward the IR limit, the treatment of the four-quark
interactions in the pointlike limit does of course not allow us to access the phase governed by spontaneous symmetry breaking. The introduction of mesonic auxiliary
fields by means of a Hubbard -Stratonovich transformation or applying the more advanced technique of dynamical hadronization, see Refs. [32, 52, 69, 102] and,
e.g., Refs. [20, 21, 39, 45, 50] for their application to
QCD, would enable us to study the dynamics even within
regimes governed by spontaneous symmetry breaking. In
order to gain nevertheless some insight into the structure of the ground state emerging in case of spontaneous
symmetry breaking, we followed the approach of our NJL
model studies in Refs. [15, 16] and analyzed the “hierarchy” of the four-quark couplings.
Our RG analysis of the UA (1)-symmetric case revealed
a clear dominance of the scalar-pseudoscalar interaction
channel associated with chiral symmetry breaking at
small quark chemical potential. Very importantly, this
dominance is not triggered by a specific choice for the
initial conditions of the four-quark couplings since all
four-quark couplings are set to zero at the initial RG
scale, i.e., they are solely gluon-induced in the RG flow.
For µ/T0 & 2.0, we then observe a change in the “hierarchy”. In this regime, the CSC channel associated with
the formation of the most conventional color superconducting condensate in two-flavor QCD now dominates
the quark dynamics. We emphasize that the dominance
pattern as a function of the quark chemical potential as
well as the actual position µχ , where the dominance pattern changes from a scalar-pseudoscalar dominance to a
CSC dominance, are found to be a remarkably robust
feature. The little influence of the considered different
running gauge couplings may be viewed as an indication
that the dominance pattern is largely determined within
the quark sector. The gauge sector as associated with
the details of the running coupling is mostly required to
bring the quarks close to criticality. Once the four-quark
couplings have been rendered sufficiently large by the underlying quark-gluon dynamics, the quarks develop their
“own dynamics” and the details of the gauge sector start
to play a subleading role, at least in the present approximation. At this point, loosely speaking, we are then
basically left with an NJL-type model. Note again that
the dynamics in our present study is not “contaminated”
by any kind of fine-tuning of the initial conditions for the
four-quark couplings which would in general favor particular channels. However, the analysis based on the “hierarchy” of the four-quark couplings must nevertheless be
taken with some care. In fact, it is clear that a dominance
of a specific four-quark coupling does neither guarantee
the formation of an associated condensate in the IR nor
does it exclude the formation of other condensates. Still,
it should also be mentioned that corresponding studies in

the context of condensed-matter theory show that the appearance of a clear dominance of a specific four-fermion
coupling is indeed a precursor for the formation of the
associated condensate [71].
In order to probe the effect of explicit UA (1)-symmetry
breaking on the phase boundary and the dominance pattern of the four-quark couplings, we implemented UA (1)violating initial conditions in form of finite values for
the coupling associated with the so-called ’t Hooft channel. Even at large chemical potential, the considered
strengths of explicit UA (1) symmetry breaking at the initial UV scale showed surprisingly little effect on the shape
of the phase boundary. The same is true for the actual
position of the point µχ , where the dominance pattern
of the four-quark couplings changes qualitatively. Compared to the UA (1)-symmetric RG flow, however, UA (1)violating initial conditions affect the “hierarchy” of the
four-quark couplings along the phase boundary which is
clearly visible in, e.g., the amplification of the dominance
of the scalar-pseudoscalar interaction channel at small
chemical potential as well as of the dominance of the
CSC channel at large chemical potential. From this, we
conclude that explicit UA (1) symmetry breaking plays
indeed an important role in the formation of the condensates, in particular with respect to the formation of the
conventional CSC ground state at large chemical potential [81–90]. Future extensions of our present work should
of course include a direct computation of the ’t Hooftcoupling within our RG flow by following earlier works
in this direction [63].
Of course, our present study can be further improved in
various directions. Still, our analysis already provides an
important insight into the dynamics underlying the QCD
phase structure at finite temperature and quark chemical potential and consolidates the findings obtained from
our preceding Fierz -complete NJL-type model study [16].
Moreover, the inclusion of gauge degrees of freedom combined with the Fierz -complete set of four-quark interactions enables us to identify the relevant effective lowenergy degrees of freedom and to determine, or at least
constrain, from first principles the couplings of a suitably
constructed truncation for the low-energy sector, in particular at large quark chemical potential. In the future,
this may prove very valuable, e.g., to study the thermodynamics of quark matter at high density. Indeed, first
steps into this direction have already been taken very
recently [14].
