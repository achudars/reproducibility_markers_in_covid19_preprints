Quantum fluctuations lead to an anomalous violation of parity symmetry in quantum electrodynamics for an even number of spatial dimensions. While the leading parity-odd electric current
vanishes in vacuum, we uncover a non-cancellation of the anomaly for strong electric fields with distinct macroscopic signatures. We perform real-time lattice simulations with fully dynamical gauge
fields and Wilson fermions in 2 + 1 space-time dimensions. In the static field limit, relevant at early
times, we solve the problem analytically. Our results point out the fundamental role of quantum
anomalies for strong-field phenomena, relevant for a wide range of condensed matter and high-energy
applications, but also for the next generation of gauge theory quantum simulators.

Introduction. Quantum electrodynamics (QED) is well
understood in vacuum and for weak electromagnetic
fields. Much less is known in the strong-field regime
relevant for a wide range of applications in condensed
matter physics [1–4], relativistic nuclear collision experiments [5–8], precision spectroscopy of highly charged
ions [9, 10], or future laser facilities [11]. A typical electric field strength characterizing the strong-field regime
is Ec = m2 /e, where m denotes the electron mass and e
is the gauge coupling [62]. For fields exceeding Ec , the
vacuum of QED becomes unstable against Schwinger pair
production of electron-positron pairs [12].
In recent years, strong-field QED phenomena have also
become a focus of research for quantum simulations [13–
20]. While the first implementation using trapped ions
still concerned the weak-field limit of QED in one spatial
dimension [21], the next generation of experiments aims
at setups in 2+1 space-time dimensions [14, 22, 23] and
with strong fields [24–26]. Among the most intriguing
phenomena that will become accessible is the anomalous
violation of parity by quantum fluctuations in QED for
an even number of spatial dimensions [27–38]. However,
there is a cancellation of the anomalous electric current
with a parity-odd contribution induced by the fermion
mass such that the phenomenon is suppressed for weak
fields in vacuum [27, 28].
In this work, we establish a non-cancellation of the
parity anomaly in the strong-field regime. This is
shown to have dramatic consequences for the presence
of anomalous currents with distinctive macroscopic signatures. The net parity-odd electric currents change
the macroscopic gauge field evolution and lead to a dynamical rotation of the electric field vector. To validate this discovery, we investigate the fundamental processes both analytically, as well as numerically using realtime lattice simulations with second-order improved Wilson fermions [39, 40]. The lattice simulations employ
classical-statistical reweighting techniques for the bosonic
gauge fields, which accurately describe the dynamics in
the strong-field regime including the mutual back-action

of the induced currents and the applied fields [39, 41–49].
Our analytical results neglect back-action and apply only
to not too late times. In their range of validity they are
found to describe the simulation data well.

as well as by a quantum anomaly [27, 28]. The index
α = 1, . . . , Nf labels flavors of the fermion field operator ψ̂ α , with Nf = 1 for QED. Here, Âµ is the gauge
potential, e the coupling, and summation over repeated
indices is implied. For the representation of the Dirac
matrices γ µ with µ = 0, 1, 2 we choose the Pauli matrices
(σ3 , iσ1 , −iσ2 ). The gauge field operator, in terms of the
gauge-invariant field strength tensor F̂νρ = ∂ν Âρ − ∂ρ Âν ,
evolves as

FIG. 1: Overview: Panel (a) illustrates the weak-field limit, where parity-odd currents from the mass term, jm , and the
quantum anomaly, jan , cancel. Panel (b) shows the situation for homogeneous fields with strengths beyond the Schwinger limit
Ec with current jclass from pair production. In this case the total current is not aligned with the applied field E0 because of
parity non-cancellation. Including the mutual back-action of fermions and gauge fields all components rotate, as pictured in
panel (c). The full evolution of the electric field E(t) at times t ≤ 12/m (solid line) and beyond (dotted) is shown in panel (d).

Anomaly non-cancellation in strong background fields.
To extend these results to the strong-field regime, we first

consider a static homogeneous electric field E0 = Ex , 0 .
This turns out to be analytically tractable also in the
presence of field strengths beyond the Schwinger limit.
We solve the Hamiltonian operator equation (1) for an
infinite volume in temporal-axial gauge, with A0 = 0 and
A = −E0 t, for fermion vacuum initial conditions prepared in the remote past [50]. We then construct currents
from bilinears of fermionic field operators in a standard
mode decomposition.
In this setup, the total current includes both parityeven and parity-odd contributions, as indicated in Fig. 1,
panel (b). The parity-even current jclass , pointing along
the x-direction, is due to conventional Schwinger pair
production for strong fields, ubiquitous in one [44], two
(this work) and three [45, 49] spatial dimensions. Conversely, the parity-odd current component along the ydirection represents the sum of the contribution from the

mass term, jm

We find that jm receives two separate contributions
of distinct physical origin, described by an integral over

This phenomenon is illustrated in Fig. 2, where we
show the total parity-violating current over a wide range
of field strengths. We note that eEx /(4π) is an upper
limit for the net parity-odd current. Below we will see
that our analytic results capture the earlier stages of the
fully dynamical evolution, where they can also be used
to benchmark numerical simulations, until back-action of
the fermions on the electric field becomes relevant.
Real-time lattice simulations with Wilson fermions.
In the regime of large fields, real-time simulations in
a Hamiltonian lattice formulation of QED2+1 [52] become feasible using classical-statistical reweighting techniques [39, 41–49]. Discretized on a spatially periodic
lattice with N 2 sites and spacing a, the O(a3 ) improved
Hamiltonian reads [39, 40, 49, 53]

C0 = 1.5, C1 = −0.3, and C2 = −1/30 with Cn>2 = 0.
As initial condition, we consider a free fermionic vacuum with homogeneous field E0 = (Ex , 0), switched-on
instantaneously at initial time t = 0.
Both the mass and Wilson parameter break parity
symmetry, and we extract the parity-odd current compoi
nents from the total fermion electric current jtotal
(t) by
a linear combination of evolutions with different choices
for the signs of m and r [27]:

Here, jtotal
(t){±m,±r} refers to the expectation value of
the lattice current operator as derived from the respective
Hamiltonian Ĥ{±m,±r} given in Eq. (8).
Specifically, we choose for the “physical” fermion
i
m, r > 0 to compute the current jtotal
(t){+m,+r} and
extract the corresponding gauge field evolution. The
latter is then implemented as a (time-dependent) background field for evolutions of the “test” fermions having
i
the other sign combinations required for jtotal
(t){−m,+r}
i
and jtotal (t){+m,−r} . For the strong homogeneous fields
employed in our study, this procedure provides a very
efficent way to compute the parity-odd components [64].
To benchmark our simulations, we first implement a
static field approximation as correspondingly employed
for our analytical results above. The simulation results
for the net parity-odd current, which are extracted after
a short √
period of time following the initial switch-on, for
e = 0.1 m, Nf = 1 and different values of the applied
field strength are summarized in Fig. 2 [65]. The data

points agree to very good accuracy with the analytical
predictions (7) and (4).
Anomalous field rotation. Next we investigate the
fully dynamical case including the mutual back-action
of gauge and fermion fields. For field strengths beyond
the Schwinger limit, the produced fermions and antifermions are accelerated to opposite directions, such that
they counteract the initial electric field. The non-linear
process leads to plasma oscillations, similar to what is
found in 1+1 dimensional [44] and 3+1 dimensional lattice simulations [45, 49].
For QED2+1 non-cancellation of the parity anomaly
leads to a macroscopic non-zero transverse current. Because of the dynamical back-action the orientation of the
electric field changes. As a consequence, the vectors describing the classical conduction current jclass and the
electric field are no longer aligned, as illustrated in panel
(c) of Fig. 1. The interplay of dynamical parity-violation
and classical conduction currents results in a non-linear
rotation of the electric field vector, accompanied by a
characteristic oscillation of its magnitude. This is illustrated in
√ Fig. 1 (d) for initial field E0 = (10Ec , 0) and
e = 0.5 m [66]. Without loss of generality, we consider
Nf = 10 fermion flavors in order to accelerate the dynamics in view of limited computational resources [67].
Throughout the evolution parity-odd currents spend
most of the time perpendicular to the electric field vector.
This is quantified in Fig. 3, which shows the orientation of
the current and electric field vectors introduced in panel
(c) of Fig. 1. This anomalous rotation of the electric field
and currents represents a distinct signal of the violation
of parity out of equilibrium.
In Fig. 4, we display the absolute values of the spatial
currents |jan (t)| (top panel) and |jm (t)| (bottom panel).
Starting from zero at initial time, the currents build up
quickly as a result of the applied field that is switched
on at t = 0. While |jan (t)| oscillates in phase with the
total electric field strength, |jm (t)| is smaller in magnitude and develops a more complicated time-dependence,
demonstrating that anomaly cancellation does not occur.
To gain analytical insights, we compare the fully dynamical simulation results to an adiabatic approximation, where we insert into our estimates (7) and (4)
the time-dependent |E(t)| obtained from the simulations.
The upper panel of Fig. 4 shows for |jan | a very good
agreement of the adiabatic approximation with the full
simulation data after a short initial period of time. The
switching-on effect at t & 0 is not captured by the analytical formulae, where the gauge field is initialized in the
remote past. We checked explicitly that the agreement
holds for a wide range of initial conditions for the gauge
fields, confirming the anomaly far from equilibrium.
In contrast, we observe differences between the full
simulation results and the adiabatic approximation for
the medium-modified current jm (t) once the fields change
on time scales ∼ m−1 , which we attribute to the effects of

higher derivative terms neglected in (7). For small gauge
couplings employed for the results of Fig. 4, the evolution
is comparably slow and the adiabatic approximation still
captures important features of the |jm (t)| evolution for
not too late times. The bottom graph of Fig. 4 shows that
the approximation agrees reasonably well with the lattice
simulation data in a regime, where the electric field already begins to oscillate and its rotation is initiated. At
later times, more rapid changes occur and significant deviations are seen. We find this phenomenon to coincide
with particles approaching the zero mode in momentum
space. In that case, there is interference with further pair
creation in the low-momentum region and the adiabatic
approximation is expected to break down [68].
Conclusions. Our results provide an intriguing example where strong fields make genuine quantum phenomena visible on macroscopic scales, which are otherwise
suppressed in near-vacuum conditions. Using ab initio simulations and analytic techniques, we established
a non-cancellation of the parity anomaly for fields exceeding the Schwinger limit for pair production. Remarkably, we find that even aspects of the fully nonlinear time-dependent processes can be approximately
described with our adiabatic formulae. Together with
the lattice simulation results these give unprecedented
insights into the strong-field regime of QED2+1 with important consequences for associated physical systems.
Moreover, our study will be instrumental for further
developments of quantum simulators for gauge theories
with the help of synthetic materials based on atomic,
molecular and optical physics engineering [13, 14, 17–
21, 26, 54–56]. There are strong international efforts towards quantum simulating QED in two spatial dimensions. Here the construction of magnetic plaquette terms

Our results indicate that the anomalous rotation of the
electric field is practically not affected by the magnetic
sector, such that first benchmark tests of genuinely 2 + 1
dimensional quantum phenomena in QED with the next
generation of quantum simulators may be realized with
a drastically reduced experimental complexity.

pears for the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly in 1 + 1 spacetime dimensions for non-zero fermion mass and weak electric field E  Ec [59].
For all simulations we employ spatially homogeneous
electric field configurations.
We employ lattice parameters in the range of ma =
0.025 − 0.1 and N 2 = 128 × 128 − 256 × 256, depending on the actual field strength to ensure insensitivity to
the lattice regularization.
We employ ma = 0.05, N 2 = 448 × 448 with fermions
of the type m, r > 0. Neither an increase or decrease of
the UV-cutoff by a factor of two (at constant physical
volume), nor a further increase of the lattice volume by
25% lead to qualitative changes of our simulation result.
Here, all Nf fermion flavors have the same mass, such
that no current cancellations between different flavors
with opposite mass signs occur.
In fact, similar effects have been observed in fermion
distributions for time-dependent electric fields with subcycle structure [60, 61].
