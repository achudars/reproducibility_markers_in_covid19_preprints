A generally covariant measurement scheme for
quantum field theory in curved spacetimes

Abstract We propose and develop a measurement scheme for quantum field theory
(QFT) in curved spacetimes, in which the QFT of interest, the “system”, is dynamically coupled to another, the “probe”, in a compact spacetime region. Measurements
of observables in the probe system then serve as proxy measurements of observables
in the system, under a correspondence which depends also on a preparation state of
the probe theory. All our constructions are local and covariant, and the conditions
may be stated abstractly in the framework of algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT).
The induced system observables corresponding to probe observables may be localized in the causal hull of the coupling region and are typically less sharp than the
probe observable, but more sharp than the actual measurement on the coupled theory.
A formula is given for the post-selected system state, conditioned on measurement
outcomes, which is closely related to the notion of an instrument as introduced by
Davies and Lewis. This formula has the important property that individual measurements form consistent composites, provided that their coupling regions can be
causally ordered and a certain causal factorisation property holds for the dynamics;
the composite is independent of the causal order chosen if more than one exists. The
general framework is amenable to calculation, as is shown in a specific example.
This contribution reports on joint work with R. Verch, arXiv:1810.06512.

1 Introduction
A typical first course on quantum mechanics will include some straightforward rules
describing measurements. It might be said, for example, that an ideal measurement
of a quantum mechanical observable returns one of the eigenvalues of the operator
representing the observable, and the system is to be found in the corresponding

eigenstate immediately afterwards, having changed instantaneously. Later, one learns
that essentially every part of this rule is a considerable oversimplification, either
technically or conceptually. Not least, the idea of an instantaneous transition is
obviously problematic in relativistic theories. Quantum measurement theory (QMT)
takes as its task the problem of refining rules of this type and putting them into an
operational context. See [8] for a recent comprehensive account. One strand of this
work is the description of measurement schemes that describe part of the process
by which physical quantities may be measured. A system of interest is prepared,
and then coupled to a probe, itself a quantum mechanical system, which is later
measured. The probe result is then interpreted as a measurement of the system. The
combination of the system, probe, coupling, and the probe observable measured, is
called a measurement scheme for the system observable indirectly measured in this
way.
This contribution describes joint work with Rainer Verch [16], which aims to adapt
these ideas to describe measurements in quantum field theory in possibly curved
spacetimes, using the methods of algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT) [17, 1].
In so doing, we bridge a surprising gap in the literature: research on AQFT, despite
its focus on local observables and local operations, has largely avoided the question
of how such observables may be measured or operations performed; on the other
hand, QMT has typically concentrated on quantum mechanical problems and avoided
questions relating to spacetime localisation. Naturally, there are exceptions, and the
works of Hellwig and Kraus [18, 20, 19] and more recent works [22, 21] may be
mentioned as discussions in which questions of measurement in AQFT have been
addressed. The reader will find much food for thought in the paper of Peres and
Terno [23]. None of these, however, take quite the line that we describe here and,
in particular, none of them consider the curved spacetime context. Again, this is a
surprise, because of the prominence of the Unruh effect [25, 9] in QFT in curved
spacetimes (QFT in CST). (See [7] for a recent discussion of some operational and
interpretative aspects of the Unruh effect.) As mentioned, a full presentation of this
work is given in [16]; our aim here is to present the outlines of the results obtained,
while remaining reasonably self-contained. The main general questions considered
are:
• what is the correspondence between probe observables and system observables?
• in particular, what can be said concerning the spacetime localisation of the
latter?
• what is the appropriate description of state change following measurement,
consistent with covariance?
• how can one combine multiple observations in different spacetime regions, and
the consequent changes of state, in a consistent way?
We emphasise that the framework is on the one hand sufficiently broad to stand as
a general description of measurement schemes in AQFT, while on the other it is
sufficiently concrete to permit calculation in particular models; we will report the
results of such calculations later on. To start, however, we begin by describing the
nature of the system, probe and the coupling between them.

2 System, probe, and coupling
In QMT the system and probe are usually quantum mechanical systems, with individual Hamiltonians HS and HP on respective Hilbert spaces HS and HP . The two
can be treated as a single system with uncoupled Hamiltonian
HU = HS ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ HP

(1)

on the combined Hilbert space H = HS ⊗ HP . A coupling can be introduced and
removed by modifying the Hamiltonian to
HC (t) = HU + Hint (t)

(2)

with Hint (t) = 0 for sufficiently early and sufficiently late times t. Alternatively one
might simply specify a unitary time evolution U(t) on the combined Hilbert space,
with U(t) = 1 for early and late t. The goal is then to understand how measurements
of observables on HP can be interpreted as measurements of observables on HS .
In this section we will introduce analogous structures for two quantum field theories with a coupling confined to a compact region of spacetime. There are two problems. First, we wish to maintain covariance and therefore avoid introducing preferred
time coordinates. This will be dealt with by adapting ideas from AQFT, particularly
in the locally covariant description developed for curved spacetimes [6, 14]. Second,
one might wonder about the physical status of coupling together quantum fields. After all, the interactions of nature are not ours to change – what, then, is the relevance,
of a formalism based on such modifications? The answer to this criticism is that the
couplings represent a proxy for an experimental design that engineers interactions
to occur in the apparatus and tries to screen out extraneous influences. For example,
electromagnetism and QCD are coupled within the standard model. But if we probe
the structure of a nucleus by directing a laser at it, we produce interactions in a
particular spacetime region, and it becomes reasonable to neglect the interactions
between electromagnetism and QCD elsewhere in spacetime. It is also true that by
choosing interaction energies we may exploit the running of coupling constants to
modify the strength of various interactions.
We now explain the formalism in more detail, which requires a short discussion
of AQFT in curved spacetimes. A recent introduction to AQFT in flat spacetimes
can be found in [12]; for an exposition of the locally covariant approach to QFT in
CST, introduced in [6], see [15].
Recall that a time-oriented Lorentzian manifold spacetime M is globally hyperbolic if it contains no closed causal curves and each of its compact sets K has a
compact causal hull J + (K) ∩ J − (K), where J +/− (S) represent the causal future/past
of a set S (where needed, we will denote J(S) = J + (S) ∪ J − (S)). Equivalently, M
contains a Cauchy surface – a subset met exactly once by every inextendible timelike
curve. A subset of M will be called causally convex if it is equal to its causal hull,
which means that it contains every causal curve between any pair of its points. If
O is any open causally convex subset of a globally hyperbolic spacetime M, then

4

Christopher J Fewster

O, equipped with the induced metric and causal structure, is a globally hyperbolic
spacetime in its own right, to be denoted M | O .
We shall be interested in QFTs that can be formulated on a class of globally
hyperbolic spacetimes that is closed under the formation of subspacetimes in the
manner just described. To each such spacetime M, we assume that such the QFT is
described on M by means of a unital ∗-algebra A(M) and subalgebras A(M; O)
sharing the unit with A(M) and labelled by open causally convex (but not necessarily
precompact) subsets O of M. The assumptions needed here are
A1 Isotony Whenever O1 ⊂ O2 ⊂ M, the corresponding local algebras are nested,
A(M; O1 ) ⊂ A(M; O2 ).

(3)

A2 Einstein causality If O1 and O2 are causally disjoint subsets of M then
A(M; Oi ) commute element-wise,
[A(M; O1 ), A(M; O2 )] = 0.

(4)

A3 Compatibility If N is an open causally convex subset of M, then there is an
injective unit-preserving ∗-homomorphism (to be described henceforth as a
monomorphism) αM;N : A(N ) → A(M) whose image is precisely A(M; N),
where N = M | N . We will refer to αM;N as a compatibility map. Whenever
M3 ⊂ M2 ⊂ M1 the compatibility maps obey the relation
αM 1 ;M 2 ◦ αM 2 ;M 3 = αM 1 ;M 3 .

(5)

A4 Timeslice property (existence of dynamics) If N is an open causally convex
subset of M and contains at least one Cauchy surface of M, then αM;N is an
isomorphism; equivalently, A(M; N) = A(M). In conjunction with compatibility, we may deduce that whenever O1 ⊂ O2 ⊂ M and O1 contains a Cauchy
surface of O2 , then
A(M; O1 ) = A(M; O2 ).
(6)
A5 Haag property Let K be a compact subset of M. Suppose that A ∈ A(M)
commutes with every element of A(M; N) for every region N contained in the
causal complement K ⊥ = M \ J(K) of K. Then A ∈ A(M; L) whenever L is a
connected open causally convex subset containing K. This is a weakened form
of Haag duality [17].
Comparing with assumptions standard in flat spacetime (see, e.g., [12]) one notes
that Poincaré covariance has been replaced by the compatibility condition. What
we have described is a cut-down version of locally covariant QFT [6, 15], the full
version of which would describe the theory as a functor from the category of globally
hyperbolic spacetimes to a category of unital ∗-algebras. Einstein causality may be
built in by suitable monoidal [5] or operadic [3] refinements. However we will not
need this level of generality here. On a point of terminology, if A ∈ A(M; O) we
will say that A is localisable in O, or that O is a localisation region for A; due to A1
and A4 there will be many possible localisation regions for a given A. Finally, recall

Generally covariant measurement schemes for QFT in CST

that a state of a theory is a positive normalised linear map ω : A(M) → C, and the
expectation value of observable A ∈ A(M) in state ω is ω(A).
Let two theories A and B be given, each of which obeys the above axioms, with
compatibility maps αM;N and βM;N respectively. We will regard A as describing
the system and B the probe. Then we obtain a further theory U, by defining
U(M) = A(M) ⊗ B(M),

(7)

for each spacetime M, and using υ M;N = αM;N ⊗ βM;N : U(N ) → U(M) as
the compatibility map when N is an open causally convex subset of M. This is the
analogue of the tensor product of the system and probe in quantum mechanics; as
ever in AQFT, the primary focus is on algebras of observables rather than on Hilbert
spaces.
We wish to describe a coupling between the system and probe in an abstract way,
without needing a specific Lagrangian description of the theories involved, and also
without introducing privileged coordinates. Let K be a compact subset of spacetime
M. Then the regions M ± = M \ J ∓ (K) are causally convex and open and constitute
covariantly defined ‘in’ (−) and ‘out’ (+) regions, so that the ‘out’ region has no
intersection with the causal past of K and the ‘in’ region has no intersection with the
causal future of K.
Definition 1 A theory C, with compatibility maps γ M;N , is a coupling of A and B
within K if, there is a family of isomorphisms
χL : U(L) → C(L)

(8)

labelled by the open causally convex subsets L of M \ (J + (K) ∩ J − (K)), with the
following compatibility property: for any two such subsets L, L ′ with L ′ ⊂ L, one
has a commuting diagram
U(L ′ )

υ L;L ′

χL ′

C(L ′)

U(L)
χL

γL;L ′

.

(9)

C(L)

In short, this definition asserts that the theories U and C coincide outside the causal
hull of K, capturing the idea that the coupling is only switched on in this region.
There is a close link to the discussion of equivalence between theories in local
covariant QFT [6, 14, 15].
Many properties of the coupling can be described in terms of a scattering map
defined as follows. For brevity, we denote the compatibility maps αM;M ± associated
with the regions M ± by α± , and the isomorphisms χM ± by χ ± (by construction, M ±
are indeed open causally convex subsets not intersecting the causal hull of K). By
the timeslice property, the monomorphisms α± , β± , υ ± , γ ± , are isomorphisms, so
the same applies to the compositions
κ ± = γ ± ◦ χ ± : U(M ± ) → C(M),

(10)

and also to the retarded (+) and advanced (−) response maps
τ ± = κ ± ◦ (υ ±)−1 : U(M) → C(M),

(11)

and finally to the scattering morphism
Θ = (τ − )−1 ◦ τ + : U(M) → U(M),

(12)

which maps algebra elements from late to early times. The scattering morphism
has important properties [16, Prop. 1]: in particular, it is unchanged if the notional
coupling region K is expanded, but keeping C the same; it also acts trivially on any
subalgebra A(M; L) labelled by a subset L ⊂ K ⊥ .

3 Induced system observables
The measurement scheme may be described loosely as follows. At early times, the
system and probe are separately prepared in states ω and σ respectively. They are
then coupled; finally, at late times, a probe observable B ∈ B(M) is measured. This
description is somewhat imprecise because the actual world of the experiment is
described by the coupled theory C, rather than the separate theories A and B, or
their uncoupled combination U. A little more precisely, what is meant is that, at
early times, one prepares a state of C(M) that has no correlations between system
and probe degrees of freedom, and at late times an observation is made that only tests
degrees of freedom in the probe. The problem of translating statements about the
coupled theory into the language of the uncoupled theory is solved by the response
maps.
Specifically, the state of C(M) corresponding at early times to the product state
ω ⊗ σ of U(M) is given by
ω σ = (τ − )−1∗ (ω ⊗ σ)
(13)
e
where the star denotes the adjoint map, i.e., ω σ (C) = (ω ⊗ σ)(τ − C). Likewise, the
observable B ∈ B(M), may be identified withe1 ⊗ B ∈ U(M) and hence corresponds
to the observable
e = τ + (1 ⊗ B)
B
(14)

of C(M), with the identification being made at late times. The expected measurement
e in the
outcome from the experiment is the expectation value for the observable B
state ω σ , which may be written
e
e = (ω ⊗ σ)(Θ(1 ⊗ B)).
ω σ ( B)
(15)
e
Notice that we use the advanced response to identify the states of the uncoupled and
coupled systems at early times, and the retarded response to identify observables at

late times. This reflects the fundamental time-asymmetry of the measuring process,
which may be sloganized as prepare early and measure late.
e as the expectation value of a system observable in
The goal is to interpret ω σ ( B)
e
state ω. To this end, we introduce the map ησ : A(M) ⊗ B(M) → A(M) defined
by
ησ (A ⊗ B) = σ(B)A,
(16)
extended by linearity, which is a completely positive map closely related to a conditional expectation. Then the map εσ : B(M) → A(M) defined by
εσ (B) = (ησ ◦ Θ)(1 ⊗ B)

(17)

clearly satisfies
e
ω(εσ (B)) = ω((ησ ◦ Θ)(1 ⊗ B)) = (ω ⊗ σ)(Θ(1 ⊗ B)) = ω σ ( B),
(18)
e
which provides an interpretation of the measurement in terms of the induced system
observable εσ (B). In other words, we have a measurement scheme for εσ (B). The
following is proved as [16, Thm 2]
Theorem 1 For each probe preparation state σ, A = εσ (B) is the unique ωe provided that A(M) is separated by its
independent solution to ω(A) = ω σ ( B),
e
states. In general, the map εσ is a completely positive linear map with the properties
εσ (1) = 1,

εσ (B∗ ) = εσ (B)∗,

εσ (B)∗ εσ (B) ≤ εσ (B∗ B) .

(19)

For fixed B, the map σ 7→ εσ (B) is weak-∗ continuous.
An immediate consequence is that each self-adjoint B = B∗ ∈ B(M) is mapped to
a self-adjoint element εσ (B) of A(M). It is important to note that εσ is generally
neither an injection, nor an algebra homomorphism. Indeed, the inequality in (19)
implies
e ω σ ) ≥ Var(εσ (B); ω),
Var( B;
(20)
e
that is, the variance of measurement results in the actual experiment of measuring
e in state ω σ is at least the variance of the hypothetical equivalent measurement of
B
e ω. The failure of ε to be a homomorphism is intimately connected
εσ (B) in state
σ
to the existence of experimental noise, i.e., fluctuations of the probe. As another
illustration, if B is a projection, then εσ (B) is in general not a projection, but rather
an effect; that is, an algebra element A so that both A and 1 − A are positive, i.e.,
0 ≤ A ≤ 1. In general, an effect A models an unsharp zero-one measurement, with
Prob(A = 1 | ω) = ω(A),

Prob(A = 0 | ω) = ω(1 − A)

(21)

in state ω. Thus, sharp (projective) measurements of the probe are to be interpreted
as unsharp measurements of the system. Combining our two observations, it may
be said that εσ (B) is typically less sharp than B, but more sharp than the actual
experimental observation.

An important question concerns the localisation of the induced system observables, which turns on the locality properties of the scattering morphism. Let L be
an open causally convex subset of K ⊥ , so Θ acts trivially on U(M; L). This has
the following consequences. First, if B ∈ B(M; L), we have 1 ⊗ B ∈ U(M; L) and
hence the corresponding induced system observable is
εσ (B) = ησ (Θ(1 ⊗ B)) = ησ (1 ⊗ B) = σ(B)1.

(22)

As one would hope, no information concerning the system can be obtained by
measuring a probe observable at spacelike separation from the coupling region; our
framework does not allow for nonlocal signalling.
Second, suppose that A ∈ A(M; L) be any system observable localised in L.
Then for an arbitrary probe observable B ∈ B(M) one has
[εσ (B), A] = [ησ (Θ(1 ⊗ B)), A] = ησ ([Θ(1 ⊗ B), A ⊗ 1)])

(23)

= ησ (Θ[1 ⊗ B, A ⊗ 1]) = 0,
as Θ leaves A ⊗ 1 invariant. By the Haag property, we infer that εσ (B) may be
localised in any connected open causally convex set containing the coupling region
K (and hence containing its causal hull). We have proved:
Theorem 2 ([16, Thm 3]) For each probe observable B ∈ B(M), the induced
system observable εσ (B) may be localised in any connected open causally convex
set containing K. If B may be localised in K ⊥ then εσ (B) = σ(B)1.
The failure of εσ to be a homomorphism is natural from another perspective.
Suppose two incompatible (noncommuting) system observables Ai (i = 1, 2) are
localisable in the causal hull of K and are in fact induced by probe observables Bi ,
Ai = εσ (Bi ). If εσ were a homomorphism, we would conclude that the Bi are incompatible, which (by Einstein causality) would prohibit the possibility of localising
them in spacelike separated regions. Turning this around, probe measurements in
spacelike separated regions that correspond to the A1 and A2 provide an unsharp
joint measurement of incompatible system observables.

4 Instruments and change of state
Suppose an effect B of the probe is measured, resulting in the value 1 (we also say
that the effect has been observed). How should the system state ω be updated in
consequence? One way of addressing this question is to require that the updated
state ω ′ on A(M) should have the property that
Prob(A; ω ′) = Probσ (A | B; ω) =

Probσ (A&B; ω)
Probσ (B; ω)

(24)

Generally covariant measurement schemes for QFT in CST

9

for all system effects A measured at late times. Here, the middle quantity is the
classical conditional probability, in the original state, that the effect A is observed,
given that B is also observed, with the subscript indicating the likely dependence
on the probe preparation state σ. On the right-hand side, A&B is the joint effect
corresponding to the operator A ⊗ B ∈ U(M). By the reasoning used in the previous
section, we have
Probσ (A&B; ω) = ω(ησ Θ(A ⊗ B)),

Probσ (B; ω) = ω(ησ Θ(1 ⊗ B))

(25)

and so our requirement on ω ′ is
ω ′ (A) =

(Iσ (B)(ω))(A)
,
(Iσ (B)(ω))(1)

(26)

where
(Iσ (B)(ω))(A) := (ω ⊗ σ)(Θ(A ⊗ B)) = (Θ∗ (ω ⊗ σ))(A ⊗ B)

(27)

and the forest of parentheses indicates that Iσ (B) is to be regarded as a map on the
dual space of A(M). Assuming that the algebra separates the states, equation (26)
implies that
Iσ (B)(ω)
(28)
ω ′ :=
Iσ (B)(ω)(1)
is the post-selected system state after selective measurement of the probe.1 The term
‘post-selection’ is used in various ways in the literature; to be clear, the meaning
intended here is given by (24), i.e., the post-selected state is the one in which the
probability of observing a system effect A is equal to the conditional probability, in
the original state, of observing A given that the probe effect is observed.
The pre-instrument Iσ (B) defined by (27) is a positive map on the dual space
A(M)∗ ; that is, it maps positive linear functionals to positive linear functionals.
Davies and Lewis [10] introduced the term instrument to describe a measure on
the σ-algebra of measurement outcomes valued in positive maps A(M)∗ ; our preinstruments are related to instruments as follows: given any measure E valued in the
effects of A(M), then X 7→ Iσ (E(X)) is a (completely positive) instrument in the
Davies–Lewis sense.
The discussion above includes non-selective probe measurement as the special
case B = 1, because the absence of any filtering on the measurement outcome is
equivalent to employing a probe effect that is observed with probability 1 in all states.
Therefore the updated state resulting from the non-selective measurement is
′
ωns
(A) = Iσ (1)(ω)(A) = (Θ∗ (ω ⊗ σ))(A ⊗ 1),

(29)

which is the partial trace of the state Θ∗ (ω ⊗ σ) over the probe. By the locality
′ (A) = ω(A) if A ∈ A(M; K ⊥ ). This
properties of Θ, it follows immediately that ωns
shows that a non-selective measurement cannot influence the results of measurements
1 Actually, one must check that ω′ is indeed a state; see [16].

10

in causally disjoint regions. The general situation for selective probe measurements
is the following [16, Thm 4].
Theorem 3 Consider a measurement of a probe effect B in which the effect is
observed. For each A ∈ A(M; K ⊥ ), the expectation value of A is unchanged in the
post-selected state ω ′ if and only if A is uncorrelated with εσ (B) in the original
system state ω, i.e., ω(Aεσ (B)) = ω(A)ω(εσ (B)).
This includes our non-selective result because εσ (1) = 1 is uncorrelated with every
system observable in every state. In general, updating the state by post-selection
changes expectation values at spacelike separation from the measurement region
(and, one expects, also in its past and future). Theorem 3 shows that the explanation
is simply to do with correlation and inference. To give a non-quantum, non-relativistic
example: if two envelopes, one red and the other blue, are sent through the post to
two addresses, then the recipient of the red envelope may infer that the envelope at
the other address is blue.
It may be clear that our account leans towards, though is not predicated upon, the
view that the state is not a physical entity,2 and away from attempts to extend ideas
like the ‘instantaneous collapse of the wavefunction’ to QFT (cf. [19]). Particularly
if one adopts a more subjective view on the nature of the state, there is a significant
question of consistency to be addressed. Experiments conducted by multiple students
in mutually spacelike separated laboratories might comprise a single experiment
controlled by their supervisor. How can the updated states obtained by the students
be reconciled, covariantly, with the overall update made by the supervisor?
Suppose that two probes are coupled to the system in compact interaction regions
K1 and K2 , so that no point of K2 lies to the past of any point in K1 . At least some
observers regard K2 as occurring later than K1 , though it is not excluded that some
might regard K2 as earlier than K1 (which happens if K1 and K2 are causally disjoint).
To each probe system Bi there is a coupled system Ci and a scattering morphism
Θi on the uncoupled algebra Ui (M) = A(M) ⊗ Bi (M). On the three-fold tensor
product A(M) ⊗ B1 (M) ⊗ B2 (M), these scattering maps may be represented by
Θ̂1 = Θ1 ⊗3 id B2 (M),

Θ̂2 = Θ2 ⊗2 id B1 (M),

(30)

where the subscript on the tensor product indicates the slot into which the identity
is inserted in each case. Alternatively, the two probes may be described as a single
probe with algebra B1 (M) ⊗ B2 (M), coupling region K1 ∪ K2 and a combined
scattering morphism Θ̂ on A(M) ⊗ B1 (M) ⊗ B2 (M). A natural assumption is that
the causal factorisation formula
Θ̂ = Θ̂1 ◦ Θ̂2

(31)

holds – this can be checked in examples but is expected on the basis e.g., of Bogoliubov’s factorisation formula in perturbative QFT [24, 11, 4]. Note that the map Θ̂2
2 ‘[A] wavefunction is not a physical object. It is only a tool for computing the probabilities of
objective macroscopic events’ – Peres and Terno in [23].

appears to the right because our scattering morphisms map from the future to the
past. One of the main results of [16] is the following consistency result.
Theorem 4 ([16, Thm 5]) Consider two probes as described above, with K2 ∩
J − (K1 ) = ∅. For all probe preparations σi of Bi (M) and all probe observables
Bi ∈ Bi (M), the following identity for the pre-instruments holds:
Iσ2 (B2 ) ◦ Iσ1 (B1 ) = Iσ1 ⊗σ2 (B1 ⊗ B2 ).

(32)

If, in fact, K1 and K2 are causally disjoint, we have
Iσ2 (B2 ) ◦ Iσ1 (B1 ) = Iσ1 ⊗σ2 (B1 ⊗ B2 ) = Iσ1 (B1 ) ◦ Iσ2 (B2 ).

(33)

The reader is referred to [16] for the proof, which is a direct calculation. Suppose that
ω1 (B1 ) , 0, so there is a nonzero probability of observing B1 , and that ω1′ (B2 ) , 0,
where ω1′ is the updated state conditioned on the observation of B1 . Then another
′′ conditioned on the obserdirect calculation shows that the post-selected state ω12
′
′ conditioned on
vation of B2 in state ω1 coincides with the post-selected state ω12
the combined effect B1 ⊗ B2 being observed in state ω. In other words, the updating
may be made in stages, and in any order if the Bi have causally disjoint localisation.
No additional assumptions are needed beyond those we have mentioned; no geometric boundaries across which state reduction occurs are needed. The cornerstone is
locality of the interactions in the coupled theories, expressed through (31).

5 A specific model
The general formalism described above is amenable to practical calculation [16].

which converges at least for sufficiently weak coupling ρ [13]. Thus, the (un)coupled
classical field equation is Green hyperbolic [2].
The (un)coupled theory may be quantized by standard means; evidently the uncoupled theory has as its algebra the algebraic tensor product of the algebras for
the free scalar fields of masses mΦ and mΨ respectively. The generators of these
algebras will be denoted Φ( f ) and Ψ( f ), labelled by test functions on M. It is of
particular relevance to find the scattering morphism acting on elements 1 ⊗ Ψ(h) in
the uncoupled algebra. In the case where h is supported in the out region M + , there
is a simple formula
Θ(1 ⊗ Ψ(h)) = Φ( f − ) ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ Ψ(h− ),

and so on. A point of interest here is that none of the computations requires a Hilbert
space representation – everything takes place at the level of the algebras.
A number of general features become apparent in this model. We give two examples. First, recall that the actual experiment takes place on the coupled system
 of
and that probe observable Ψ(h) is identified at late times with observable Ψ(h)
the coupled system, while the system state is identified with a state ω σ . A simple

Given sufficient regularity, λ 7→ ω(eiλΦ(f ) ) and λ 7→ σ(eiλΨ(h ) ) are the characteristic functions of probability measures for measurement outcomes of Φ( f − ) in
state ω and Ψ(h− ) in state σ. Using (44) we see that the measurement outcomes
 in state ω σ – the outcomes of the actual experiment performed – are disof Ψ(h)
e to the convolution of these measures, with characteristic function
tributed according


Ψ(h)
λ 7→ ω σ (e
). This illustrates the general fact that the actual measurement is
e than the hypothetical measurement of the induced observable, due to
less sharp
fluctuations in the probe system. In particular, one has

Var(Ψ(h);
(45)
e
for the variance of the measured observable, assuming for simplicity that σ has
vanishing one-point function.
Second, the localisation of the induced observables can be determined. Taking the
probe observable Ψ(h) as our example (with h ∈ C0∞ (M + )), the induced observable
has localisation determined by the support of f − , contained within the intersection
J − (supp h) ∩ supp ρ. Unsurprisingly, the localisation of the probe observable must
intersect the causal future of the coupling in order to constitute a nontrivial system
measurement.
The general formalism allows one to assert that the induced observable may be
localised roughly within the causal hull of J − (supp h) ∩ supp ρ. It is very tempting
to try to ascribe it the localisation supp f − , particularly if ρ were localised in a
thin tube near a timelike curve, for the spatial dimensions of the causal hull are
proportional (with constant equal to the speed of light) to the temporal duration of
the coupling and it might be convenient to replace this with a much smaller spacetime
volume. A simple argument can be given to disabuse the reader of such temptations.
Consider two induced observables, εσ (Ψ(h)) and εσ (Ψ(h ′)). Their commutator may
be computed as
[εσ (Ψ(h)), εσ (Ψ(h ′))] = [Φ( f − ), Φ( f ′− )] = iE P ( f −, f ′− )1,
where
E P ( f1, f2 ) =

Crucially, the right-hand side of (46) depends on the geometry throughout the region
S = (J + (supp f − ) ∩ J − (supp f ′− )) ∪ (J − (supp f − ) ∩ J + (supp f ′− )).

(48)

Typically, it will be possible to find h ′ so that the supports of f ′− and f − are
equal, whereupon S is the causal hull of supp f − . Consequently, there are questions
concerning the induced observable εσ (Ψ(h)), e.g., it compatibility or otherwise with
another observable, that cannot be answered without knowledge of the geometry of

14

the causal hull of supp f − . It seems unhelpful or misleading, therefore, to ascribe
any smaller localisation to εσ (Ψ(h)).
For example, if the coupling is supported precisely on a timelike curve segment
γ : [0, τ] → M, then the localisation region must include J + (γ(0)) ∩ J −(γ(τ)). For a
uniformly accelerated trajectory of infinite proper duration, as in the Unruh–deWitt
detector analysis, the localisation region becomes an entire wedge region of infinite
spatial extent.

6 Conclusion
The framework set out here, and in full detail in [16], provides a fully covariant
measurement scheme for general QFTs in curved spacetimes, which brings together
quantum measurement theory and algebraic QFT. It is not tied to particular models,
and formulates its assumptions in abstract terms; on the other hand, it allows for
practical computations in specific models. It describes both the correspondence
between observables of the probe and induced system observables, and also the
updating of states by post-selection, with non-selective measurement as a special
case. Several more topics are discussed in [16] but not here, including the role of
gauge invariance and symmetries, and a perturbative treatment of the specific model
studied in 5. It was also shown – for our model – how the product on the probe algebra
could be deformed to make the mapping εσ into a homomorphism, providing a sense
in which the system observables are partially represented within the probe algebra.
Above all, we wish to emphasise three points in particular. First, the localisation
properties of the induced observables were discussed; they may all be localised within
any connected open causally convex neighbourhood of the coupling region K. Such
neighbourhoods necessarily contain the causal hull of K and we have argued in the
context of our model that no smaller localisation region can be expected. Second, the
post-selected states satisfy an important consistency condition that allows multiple
measurements to be combined into overarching measurements whenever they are
subject to a causal order (and independently of the choice of order where relevant).
Finally, incorporating the central insight of AQFT, our approach puts the principle
of locality at its centre.
