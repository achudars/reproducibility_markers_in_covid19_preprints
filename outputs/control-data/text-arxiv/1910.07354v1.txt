We introduce a holographic model encapsulating the dynamics of safe quantum field theories.

The discovery of a holographic description of N = 4 super Yang-Mills led to a revolution in our understanding of
four dimensional gauge theories known as the AdS-CFT
correspondence [1–3]. See also [4–9] for an incomplete
list of references useful for this work. For reviews on
the subject see, for example, [10–14]. Going away from
maximally supersymmetric theories the community concentrated on capturing the non-perturbative dynamics
of asymptotically free quantum field theories via holographic toy-models [15–20]. One of the important properties of asymptotic freedom [21, 22] is that it is a well
defined theory at short distance. This is so because in
the UV is controlled by a non-interacting CFT. Another
way of expressing the same point is that the theory is
cutoff free. This should be contrasted with purely four
dimensional scalar field theories that are trivial because
the only way to eliminate the UV cutoff is for the theory
to be non-interacting at all scales [23–25]. This is also
known as the triviality problem, which limits the predictivity to a scale of maximal UV extension [26]. Freedom
is, however, not the only solution to this problem as long
as the UV is controlled by a CFT which can be interacting. This is the safe scenario [27].
The notable difference between freedom and safety is
that canonical power counting is modified at high energy.
Couplings may become large in the UV and small expansion parameters are often unavailable complicating the
task of discovering asymptotic safety. Nevertheless, by
taking the space-time dimensionality as a continuous parameter a few rigorous results for asymptotically safe UV
fixed points exist [27–34] in the spirit of the ǫ-expansion
[35], or by using large-N techniques [36–44].
The discovery of controllable purely four dimensional
safe quantum field theories [45, 46] demonstrated that
the class of fundamental quantum field theories [47, 48]
is much wider than previously envisioned. Motivated by
this we engineer the first safe hologram by assuming that
the UV and IR conformal dynamics to be described by
AdS spaces.
The physics of an UV safe fixed point that is linked
to an IR gaussian one (related to the loss of asymptotic
freedom) can be captured by this schematic form of the
beta function
β(A) = bA2 (AUV − A)

with b > 0 ,

(1)

with A = g 2 /(4π)2 the gauge coupling strength.
The simplified five-dimensional bulk theory that we
take to describe the gauge dynamics reads


Sbulk = dd xdz |det(gab )| g ab (∂a χ∂b χ) + V (χ) .

Here we do not consider the global flavour dynamics
that can be added later and assume the following nondynamical metric (i.e. no back-reaction, MP l → ∞ limit
[49, 50])

χ is the dilaton and its bulk profile is taken to reproduce
the running of the 4D coupling constant via the relation
eχ(z) = A(z) ,

(4)

with the following relation between the bulk coordinate
z and the RG scale µ
z=

1
.
µ

(5)

In the following, thanks to (4), we will write all the relevant functions directly in terms of A.
It is worth recalling that in the safe scenario the limit
z = 0 corresponds to the UV and it describes an interacting CFT. At z = ∞ we are in the deep IR and therefore
we are describing a non-interacting CFT.
It is convenient to introduce a superpotential-like object W (A) related to the dilaton potential via
L2 V (A) =

1
(A∂A W (A))2 − d W (A) .
2

(6)

with d the dimension of the boundary space time. We
are assuming no gravitational back reaction. This is the
reason why we have a term linear rather than quadratic
in W [51].
The equation of motion of A(z) reads:
z∂z A = A2 ∂A W (A) .

(7)

2
By definition the above is minus the beta function of A
given in (1). This yields:
∂A W = −

β(A)
.
A2

(8)

To obtain simple analytic solutions it is convenient to
split the double zero at the origin of the beta function
into two single zero one at the origin and the other
at a distance ǫ from the origin. The second is an IR
interacting Wilson-Fisher fixed point of the theory in
d = 4 − ǫ dimensions. We shall denote this fixed point
with AIR = ǫ/(bAUV ) and re-write the beta function accordingly.
β(A) = bA(A − AIR )(AUV − A) ,

(9)

up to ǫ corrections to the original AUV . The above returns (1) in the ǫ = 0 limit. Working with (9) we have:


1
W (A) = b A (A − 2(AIR + AUV )) + AUV AIR log (A) ,
2
(10)
up to an integration constant.
One of the important quantities characterising the specific CFT is the scaling exponents related to the first
derivative of the beta function at a fixed point. These
are also related to the operator dimensions of the theory field strength Fµν F µν . The scaling exponents can be
readily computed from the beta function via [52–57]
∆F 2 = d + ∂A β −

β
.
A

(11)

A factor of two appearing in front of β/A in [55] is incorrect [56, 57]. The equation above yields at the two
non-trivial fixed points
∆IR = d + bAIR (AUV − AIR ) ,
∆UV = d − bAUV (AUV − AIR ) .

(12)

In the holographic picture we have
2
∂log
A (V

) = ∆ (∆ − d) ,

(13)

evaluated at the U V and IR fixed points. One finds
either
2
∆ = ∂log
AW

2
or d − ∆ = ∂log
AW ,

(14)

ad the fixed points. Consistency with (11) requires to use
the second expression so that we reproduce (12). The correct anomalous dimension of the field strength, i.e. without the factor of 2 in front of β/A, can be independently
derived from the holographic construction when substituting (8) in the second relation of (14).
We are now ready to solve for the background field in
the coupling range AIR ≤ A ≤ AUV by integrating the
beta function

Via (4) we have also the bulk profile for the dilaton χ(z).
To compute relevant correlation functions in d dimensions we now solve the equation of motion for χ(z, x)

z 2 ∂z2 + ∂x2 χ(z, x) − (d − 1)z∂z χ(z, x) = ∂χ V (χ) . (17)

and linearizing in ξ we get


z 2 ∂z2 ξ(z, k)−(d−1)z∂z ξ(z, k) = k 2 z 2 + ∂χ2 V (χ(z)) ξ(z, k) .

According to the holographic dictionary, knowing ξ(z, k)
allows us to determine the two point correlation function

from the z → 0 limit through the identification

ξ(z, k) → ξ0 (k) z d−∆U V + G2 (k)z ∆U V .

(21)

We now test the correctness of the holographic dual by
derermining an analytic solution for G2 in the k → 0
limit.
In general it is not possible to obtain an exact analytic
expression for ξ(z, k). Therefore we will use an approximate method - the matching procedure [51, 58, 59]: we
first compute the solution in the z → ∞ limit. Here the
equation simplifies to
 2 2

z ∂z − (d − 1)z∂z − k 2 z 2 − ∆IR (∆IR − d) ξ(z, k) = 0 ,

(22)

and with the well behaved solution for any k and large z
we have

Another useful limit is for k → 0 and arbitrary z for
which we have
z 2 ∂z2 ξ(z, k)−(d−1)z∂z ξ(z, k) = ∂χ2 V (χ(z))ξ(z, k) . (24)
The solution in this limit can be written as
ξk→0 (z, k) = c1 (k)ξ1 (z) + c2 (k)ξ2 (z) ,

(25)

This result confirms the expected IR behaviour of the
F 2 operator two point correlation function. It therefore
demonstrates that our holographic engineering of a safe
quantum field theory is well defined. One can now go
beyond this initial investigation by determining the full
G2 dependence on k either numerically or via an approximate analytic solution [49].

4
So far we concentrated on the gauge degrees of freedom, however, in the future, one can also explore flavour
symmetries by opportunely introducing new holographic
bulk fields corresponding, for example, to a fermion bilinear at the boundary.
We are now ready to discuss the holographic engineering of the safe theory discovered in [45] which is
an SU (Nc ) gauge theory featuring gauge fields Aaµ with
a
associated field strength Fµν
, Nf Dirac fermions Qi
(i = 1, · · · , Nf ) transforming according to the fundamental representation of the gauge group (color-index
muted), and an Nf × Nf complex matrix scalar field H
uncharged under the gauge group. The fundamental action is [44, 45]:

We have normalized the couplings with the appropriate
powers of Nc and Nf so that in the Veneziano-Witten
limit Nf /Nc is a finite number. In dimensions different
from four the couplings are dimensionful. We will denote
by βi with i = (g, y, h, v) the β-functions for the dimensionless version of the couplings in Eq. (48), which we will
still call αi for simplicity. We express the β functions in
terms of
δ=

The term linear in αg emerges in d = 4 − ǫ dimensions
[34]. The phase diagram in d = 4 − ǫ dimensions has
been studied in [34]. It is clear that the beta function of
(50) has the same form of (9) and with the identification

Tr is the trace over both color and flavor indices, and
the decomposition Q = QL + QR with QL/R = 12 (1 ±
γ5 )Q is understood. In four dimensions, the model has
four classically marginal coupling constants given by the
gauge coupling g, the Yukawa coupling y, the quartic
scalar coupling u and the ‘double-trace’ scalar coupling
v, which we write as:
2

and IR fixed points are on a globally defined RG line
that separates different physical phases, the separatrix.
On the (peturbative) separatrix the two-loops effective
gauge beta function can be written only in terms of the
gauge coupling:

which in the Veneziano-Witten limit is a continuous parameter taking values in the interval [− 11
2 , ∞).
In four dimensions, once asymptotic freedom is lost
for Nf > 11Nc /2, the theory develops an UV interacting
fixed point controlled by 1 ≫ δ > 0. which is connected
to an infrared free gaussian fixed point. The UV critical
surface is one-dimensional meaning that the Yukawa, and
the two scalar couplings can be written as functions of
the gauge coupling [45]. This also means that the UV

can now determine all the relevant holographic information in terms of the gauge-theory quantities such as:

(52)

The above allows us to map the theory into its geometric
description and compute the F 2 two-point function via
(46).
To determine correlators to flavour symmetries we need
to introduce the related bulk fields and re-determine their
backgrounds and perturbations.
We engineered the first holographic construction of safe
quantum field theories. We have shown that the holographic dual permits to compute relevant correlators of
the underlying gauge dynamics. We then applied our construction to the first known model of four dimensional
safe quantum field theories. In the future we aim at
making the correspondence crispier by, for example, investigating the fate and impact of the global symmetries
of the theory. The holographic engineering can also be
used as a model of non-perturbative safe dynamics emerging at finite number of flavours and colors in [45]. The
formalism can also be employed to analyse the safe dynamics [60, 61] of non-abelian gauge-fermion theories at
finite number of colors and very large number of flavours.
Here one can use the knowledge of the leading order in
the 1/Nf beta function and fermion mass anomalous dimensions [60, 62–64]. Because the UV zero in the beta
function stems from a logarithmic singularity, consistency

5
checks are important [61, 65]. First principle lattice investigations have recently appeared [66] while early studies
can be found in [67]. Finally, adding large charges in the
holographic framework can be used to cross-check the
construction against the large charge expansion for safe
quantum field theories introduced in [68].
