Abstract Coding theory and t-designs have close connections and interesting interplay. In
this paper, we first introduce a class of ternary linear codes and study their parameters. We
then focus on their three-weight subcodes with a special weight distribution. We determine
the weight distributions of some shortened codes and punctured codes of these three-weight
subcodes. These shortened and punctured codes contain some codes that have the same
parameters as the best ternary linear codes known in the database maintained by Markus
Grassl at http://www.codetables.de/. These three-weight subcodes with a special weight distribution do not satisfy the conditions of the Assmus-Mattson theorem and do not admit
2-transitive or 2-homogeneous automorphism groups in general. By employing the theory
of projective geometries and projective generalized Reed-Muller codes, we prove that they
still hold 2-designs. We also determine the parameters of these 2-designs. This paper mainly
confirms some recent conjectures of Ding and Li regarding Steiner systems and 2-designs
from a special type of ternary projective codes.

1 Introduction
We start with a brief recall of t-designs. Let P be a set of ν elements and B a collection of
b k-subsets of P , where ν ≥ 1, b ≥ 1 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ν. Let t be a positive integer with t ≤ k.
The pair D = (P , B ) is called a t-(ν, k, λ) design, or simply t-design, if every t-subset of P
is contained in exactly λ elements of B . The elements of P are called points, and those of

B are referred to as blocks. It is possible for a design to have repeated blocks. A t-design is
called simple if B does not contain repeated blocks. In this paper, we consider only simple
t-designs with ν > k > t. A t-(ν, k, λ) design is called a Steiner system denoted by S(t, k, ν)
if t ≥ 2 and λ = 1.
Linear codes and t-designs are companions. A t-design D = (P , B ) induces a linear code
over GF(p) for any prime p. Let P = {p1 , . . . , pν }. For any block B ∈ B , the characteristic
vector of B is defined by the vector cB = (c1 , . . . , cν ) ∈ {0, 1}ν , where

1, if pi ∈ B,
ci =
0, if pi 6∈ B.
For a prime p, a linear code C p (D) over the prime field GF(p) from the design D is spanned
by the characteristic vectors of the blocks of B, which is the subspace Span{vB : B ∈ B }
of the vector space GF(p)ν . Linear codes C p (D) from designs D have been studied and
documented in the literature (see, for examples, [1, 5, 19, 21]).
On the other hand, a linear code C may induce a t-design under certain conditions,
which is formed by the supports of codewords of a fixed Hamming weight in C . Let P (C ) =
{0, 1, . . . , n − 1} be the set of the coordinate positions of C , where n is the length of C . For
a codeword c = (c0 , . . . , cn−1 ) in C , the support of c is defined by
Supp(c) = {i : ci 6= 0, i ∈ P (C )}.
Let Bw (C ) = {Supp(c) : wt(c) = w and c ∈ C }. For some special C , (P (C ), Bw (C )) is a
t-design. In this way, many t-designs are derived from linear codes [1, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 14, 18,
19, 21]. A major approach to constructing t-designs from codes is the use of the AssmusMattson Theorem [3, 13]. Another major approach to constructing t-designs from linear
codes is the use of linear codes with t-homogeneous or t-transitive automorphism groups
[8, Theorem 4.18]. Interplay between codes and designs could be found in [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8,
10, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 21].
In [9], Ding and Li constructed some t-designs from linear codes and presented some
conjectured infinite families of 2-designs from linear projective ternary codes. Let m ≥ 3 be
an odd integer and let α be a primitive element of GF(3m ). Let C1 and C2 be linear codes
defined by

Let (Ak (Ci ))k=0 and Ak (Ci⊥ ) k=0 denote the weight distributions of Ci and Ci⊥ , respectively, where i = 1, 2. In [9], Ding and Li made the following interesting conjectures of

Conjecture 1 Let Ci be the ternary code in (1) or (2). Let k be an integer satisfying Ak (Ci ) >

The minimum distance of the dual code Ci⊥ is only 4. Hence, the famous AssmusMattson theorem guarantees only 1-designs supported by Ci . When m = 5 and 7, Magma
experimental results showed that Ci is not 2-transitive or 2-homogeneous. Thus, in general,
Ci is not 2-transitive or 2-homogeneous. Consequently, the degree of transitivity or homogeneity of their automorphism groups cannot be employed to proved that the two codes
support 2-designs.
The objective of this paper is to develop a different method to settle these conjectures.
Specifically, using projective generalized Reed-Muller codes, we prove that Conjectures 1
and 2 hold, and Conjecture 3 is true for k ∈ {4, 5, 6, 7}.

2 Preliminaries
In this section, we briefly recall some results on linear codes, quadratic forms, projective
geometries and projective generalized Reed-Muller codes.

Let C be an [n, k, d] linear code over GF(q). Denote by (A0 , A1 , . . ., An ) and (A⊥
0 , A1 , . . ., An )
the weight distributions of C and its dual C ⊥ , respectively. The Pless power moments [13]

to prove the following theorem [13, Theorem 7.3.1].
Theorem 1 Let S ⊆ {1, 2, . . . , n} with #S = s. Then the weight distributions of C and C ⊥
⊥
are uniquely determined by A⊥
1 , . . . , As−1 and the Ai with i 6∈ S. These values can be found
from the first s equations in (3).

2.2 Quadratic forms
An m-ary quadratic form over a field GF(q) is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 2 in m
variables with coefficients in GF(q):
m−1

F(x0 , . . ., xm−1 ) =

∑ ai, j xi x j ,

ai, j ∈ GF(q).

i, j=0

Two quadratic forms F and F ′ over GF(q) are called equivalent if there is an m-by-m nonsingular matrix A such that F ′ (x0 , . . ., xm−1 ) = F((x0 , . . ., xm−1 ) · A). If q is odd, then every
m-ary quadratic form F(x0 , . . ., xm−1 ) over GF(q) is equivalent to the following diagonal
form
a0 x20 + · · · + as−2 x2s−2 + as−1 x2s−1 ,
where ai ∈ GF(q)∗ [16, Theorem 6.21]. The number s is called the rank of F.
For an m-ary quadratic form F over GF(q), set
N(F = 0) = # {(x0 , . . . , xm−1 ) ∈ GF(q)m : F(x0 , . . ., xm−1 ) = 0} .
Suppose that F is equivalent to the diagonal form a0 x20 + · · · + as−2 x2s−2 + as−1 x2s−1 with
ai ∈ GF(q)∗ . Then, one has the following result on N(F = 0) [16]:

N(F = 0) =

where η denotes the quadratic character of GF(q)∗ .

2.3 Designs from projective geometries
Let q be a prime power and m ≥ 2 be an integer. We denote by PG(m − 1, q) the projective geometry of projective dimension m − 1 over the field GF(q). Its elements are the
subspaces of GF(q)m and its incidence relation is the set-theoretic inclusion. A point of the
projective geometry is given in homogeneous coordinates by (x0 , x1 , . . . , xm−1 ) where all xi
are in GF(q) and are not all zero; each point has q − 1 coordinate representations, since
(ax0 , ax1 , ..., axm−1 ) and (x0 , x1 , ..., xm−1 ) yield the same 1-dimensional subspace of GF(q)m
for any non-zero a ∈ GF(q). The 1-dimensional subspaces of GF(q)m are the points of the
projective geometry. The projective dimension of a subspace is defined to be 1 less than the
dimension of the subspace (as a vector space over GF(q)).
For any integer 2 ≤ r ≤ m − 1, let P be the set of points of PG(m − 1, q) and B the
collection of all the subspaces of projective dimension r −1 of PG(m−1, q). Since the action
of the projective general linear group on the points of PG(m − 1, q) is doubly-transitive,
(P , B ) is a 2-design with parameters depending on m, r and q, which will be denoted by
m

PD(r − 1, m − 1, q). The 2-design PD(1, m − 1, q) is a Steiner system S(2, q + 1, qq−1

2.4 Projective generalized Reed-Muller codes
For an inter r ≥ 0, let PP(r, m − 1, q) be the linear subspace of GF(q)[x0 , x1 , . . ., xm−1 ], which
im−1
is spanned by all monomial xi00 xi11 · · · xm−1
satisfying the following two conditions
– ∑m−1
j=0 i j ≡ 0 (mod q − 1),
– 0 < ∑m−1
j=0 i j ≤ r(q − 1).
Each a ∈ GF(q) is viewed as the constant function fa (x0 , x1 , . . . , xm−1 ) ≡ a.
Let {x1 , . . ., xN } be the set of projective points in PG(m − 1, q), where N =
the rth order projective generalized Reed-Muller code PRM(r, m − 1, q) of
given as
PRM(r, m − 1, q) =



qm −1
q−1 . Then,
m

length qq−1
is


f (x1 ), . . . , f (xN ) : f ∈ PP(r, m − 1, q) ∪ GF(q) .

When r > 1, let PRM∗ (r, m − 1, q) be the subcode of PRM(r, m − 1, q) defined by
PRM∗ (r, m − 1, q) =




f (x1 ), . . ., f (xN ) : f ∈ PP(r, m − 1, q) .

Thus, PRM∗ (r, m − 1, q) is the even-like subcode of PRM(r, m − 1, q). For the minimum
weight and the dual of the projective generalized Reed-Muller code, we have the following
[2].
Theorem 2 Let 0 ≤ r ≤ m − 1. Then, the minimal weight of PRM(r, m − 1, q) is

qm−r −1
q−1

and

PRM(r, m − 1, q)⊥ = PRM∗ (m − 1 − r, m − 1, q).
The following theorem gives the relationship between the codes C p (PD(r − 1, m − 1, q))
of designs arising from projective geometries and the projective generalized Reed-Muller
codes [2].
Theorem 3 Let m be a positive integer, p a prime, and 0 ≤ r ≤ m.
(i) The code C p (PD(r − 1, m − 1, p)) from the design of points and projective (r − 1)dimensional subspaces of the projective geometry PG(m − 1, p) is the same as PRM(m −

In this section, we introduce a class of ternary cyclic codes of length 3 2−1 , and determine
the parameters of these codes and their dual codes.
Let m be a positive integer, α be a generator of GF(3m )∗ and β = α2 . Then β is a primitive
3m −1
-th root of unity in GF(3m ). Let l be a positive integer and E = {ki : 0 ≤ i ≤ l} a set of

integers with 0 ≤ k0 < k1 < · · · < kl ≤ m2 . A ternary cyclic code C (E) of length n = 3 2−1 is
defined by

).

To determine the parameters of C (E) and its dual, we need some results on irreducible
polynomials. For an integer e, let Mα−e (x) ∈ GF(3)[x] be the minimal polynomial of α−e
over GF(3). We have the following lemma on Mα−e (x).
Lemma 1 Let k and k′ be two integers such that 0 ≤ k, k′ ≤ m2 . Then

(ii) Mα−(3k +1) (x) = M −(3k′ +1) (x) if and only if k = k .



Proof (i) Note that deg Mα−(3k +1) (x) is the least positive integer d ≤ m such that
(3k + 1)3d ≡ (3k + 1)

(mod 3m − 1).

(6)

It suffices to prove that Equation (6) holds if and only if d = k = m2 or d = m. If d =
k = m2 or d = m, we can easily verify that Equation (6) holds. Conversely, suppose that
(3k + 1)3d ≡ (3k + 1) (mod 3m − 1) and d < m. If k + d < m, then 3k+d + 3d = 3k + 1 and
d = 0, which leads to a contradiction with d > 0. If k +d ≥ m, then (3k +1)3d ≡ 3k+d−m +3d
(mod 3m −1). From 0 ≤ k +d −m ≤ m2 , we have 3k+d−m +3d = 3k +1, i.e., d = k, k +d −m =
0, and d = k = m2 . Part (i) follows.
(ii) Suppose Mα−(3k +1) (x) = M −(3k′ +1) (x). This holds if and only if there exists a positive
α

′

integer d ≤ m such that (3k + 1)3d ≡ 3k + 1 (mod 3m − 1). If d = m, then k = k′ . If d < m
′
and k + d < m, then we have 3k+d + 3d = 3k + 1, which contradicts the fact that d ≥ 1. If
′
d < m and k + d ≥ m, then we get 3k+d−m + 3d ≡ 3k + 1 (mod 3m − 1). Hence k′ = d and
k = m − d. From k, k′ ≤ m2 , one obtains k′ = k = d = m2 . Part (ii) follows.
As a consequence of Lemma 1, we have the following proposition on some parameters
of C (E).

unique quadratic form F ∈ PP(1, m − 1, 3) such that ci = F(ρ(αi )), where n = 3 2−1 . Then,
wt(c) =

3m − N(F = 0)
,

where F was defined in (4) and wt(c) is the Hamming weight of c. Suppose that F is equivalent to the diagonal form a0 x20 + · · · + as−2 x2s−2 + as−1 x2s−1 with ai ∈ GF(3)∗ . Using (4), one
gets

if s ≡ 1 (mod 2),
s
wt(c) =
3m−1 ± 3m−1− 2 , if s ≡ 0 (mod 2).
Since F 6= 0, then s ≥ 1. Thus, wt(c) ≥ 3m−1 − 3m−1−1 = 2 · 3m−2 . In addition, choose F =

x20 − x21 and c = F(ρ(αi )) i=0 . Then, wt(c) = 2 · 3m−2 . Hence, the minimum weight of

4 Shortened codes and punctured codes from C (E)
In this section, we present some ternary codes by shortening and puncturing some subcodes
of C 0, 1, . . . , ⌊ m2 ⌋ with the weight distribution in Table 1, and determine their weight distributions.
Let C be an [n, k, d] code and T a set of t coordinate positions in C . We use C T to denote
the code obtained by puncturing C on T , which is called the punctured code of C on T .
Let C (T ) be the subcode of C , which is the set of codewords which are 0 on T . We now
puncture C (T ) on T , and obtain a linear code CT , which is called the shortened code of C
on T . We have the following result on the punctured code and shortened code of a code C
[13]:
T
(CT )⊥ = C ⊥ .
(8)

To determine the weight distributions of shortened codes from C (E), we will need the
following lemma.

Lemma 2 Let C be an [n, k, d] code over GF(q) and d ⊥ the minimum distance of C ⊥ . Let
i1 , . . ., is be s positive integers and T a set of t coordinate positions of C , where i1 < · · · <
T
is ≤ n and t < d ⊥ . Suppose that Ai (C ) = 0 for any i 6∈ {0, i1 , . . ., is } and A1 ( C ⊥ ), . . . ,

T
As−1 ( C ⊥ ) are independent of the elements of T . Then, the code CT has dimension k − t.
T
Furthermore, the weight distributions of CT and C ⊥ are independent of the elements of
T and can be determined from the first s equations in (3).
Proof Form [13], CT has dimension k − t, and (CT )⊥ = C ⊥
this lemma then follow from Theorem 1.

Magma experiments showed that all the shortened codes C{t1 ,t2 } have the same weight

are not equivalent. Therefore, the automorphism group of the code C is in general not 2homogeneous and 2-transitive.

To determine the weight distributions of some punctured codes from C (E), we need the
next lemma.
Lemma 5 Let C be an [n, k, d] code over GF(q) and let d ⊥ denote the minimum distance of
C ⊥ . Let t be a positive integer and T a subset of the coordinate positions of C , where t < d ⊥
and #T ≤ t. Suppose that Ai (CT ) is independent of the elements of T and depends only on
the size of T . Define
Wi (C , T ) = {c = (c0 , . . ., cn−1 ) ∈ C : wt(c) = i, c j 6= 0 for all j ∈ T } .
Then, #Wi (C , T ) is independent of the elements of T and depends only on the size of T .

dimension k = 2m. For i ∈ {3m−1 − 3 2 , 3m−1 , 3m−1 + 3 2 }, using the definition of C {t1 ,t2 } ,
we deduce that

 Ai (C {t1 ,t2 } ) = Ai (C{t1 ,t2 } ),
A (C {t1 ,t2 } ) = Ai (C ) − Ai (C{t1 ,t2 } ) − #Wi (C , {t1 ,t2 }),
 i−1 {t1 ,t2 }
Ai−2 (C

It then follows from Lemma 5 that

#Wi (C , {t1 ,t2 }) = Ai (C ) − 2Ai (C{0} ) + Ai (C{0,1} ).
The desired conclusions then follow from Theorems 6 and 7.
m

Example 4 Let m = 5, E = {0, 1}, 0 ≤ t1 < t2 ≤ 3 2−1 −1 and C = C (E). Then the punctured

1764z72 + 17604z79 + 17604z80 + 4238z81 + 4806z88 + 3348z89 + 558z90 . This code has the
same parameters as the best ternary linear code known in the database maintained by Markus

Our Magma experiments showed that for many different pairs of {t1 ,t2 } and {t1′ ,t2′ }, the

From Theorem 10, this

Remark 2 Corollary 1 confirmed Conjecture 2, and proved that the Steiner system PD(1, m−
1, 3) is supported by many ternary linear codes. It is an interesting problem to find a linear
code that supports a given design. This is in general a hard problem. In addition, Corollary
1 says that the duals of many subcodes of C 0, 1, . . . , ⌊ m2 ⌋ do not support a new Steiner
system, but the geometric Steiner system PD(1, m − 1, 3).
Let D be a t-(v, k, λ) design. For a majority decoding of the code Cq (D)⊥ , Tonchev
introduced the dimension of D over GF(q), which is defined to be minimum dimension
of all linear codes of length v over GF(q) that contain the blocks of D as the supports of
codewords of weight k [20]. When q = 2, the dimension of D over GF(q) is the same as
the rank of D over GF(q). When q > 2, the rank of D over GF(q) is an upper bound of the
dimension of D over GF(q). Since C 0, 1, . . . , ⌊ m2 ⌋ has dimension m(m + 1)/2, its dual has
dimension (3m − 1 − m(m + 1))/2. As a result, the dimension of PD(1, m − 1, 3) over GF(3)
is upper bounded by (3m − 1 − m(m + 1))/2. Then the following open problem arises.
Open Problem 1 Is the dimension of the Steiner system PD(1, m − 1, 3) over GF(3) equal
to (3m − 1 − m(m + 1))/2.
We will need the following lemma from [8, p. 121] to determine the parameters of some
t-designs.
Lemma 6 Let C be a linear code over GF(3) with minimum weight d. Let c and c′ be two
codewords of weight i and Supp(c) = Supp(c′ ), where d ≤ i ≤ 2d −1. Then c′ = c or c′ = −c.

6 Summary
In this paper, from a ternary linear subcode of C (0, 1, . . . , m−1
2 ) with the weight distribution
in Table 1, some infinite families of 2-designs with various block sizes were confirmed and
their parameters were settled. Notice that the automorphism group of a ternary code with
the weight distribution in Table 1 is in general neither 2-transitive nor 2-homogeneous. In
addition, such codes do not satisfy the conditions in the Assmus-Mattson Theorem. Hence,
we had to use a direct approach to proving that the codes hold 2-designs. This makes the
designs presented in this paper very interesting, as such non-symmetric designs are rare.
Another contribution of this paper is the construction of three-weight, six-weight and
nine-weight ternary linear codes by shortening and puncturing the ternary codes with the
weight distribution in Table 1. The parameters of these codes appear to be new. These codes
include some optimal codes with the same parameters as the best ternary linear codes known
in the database maintained by Markus Grassl at http://www.codetables.de/. These ternary
codes can be employed to obtain secret sharing schemes with interesting access structures
using the framework in [4, 22].
It is still open if a ternary linear code with the weight distribution in Table 1 is always
equivalent to a subcode of C (0, 1, . . ., m−1
2 ).
