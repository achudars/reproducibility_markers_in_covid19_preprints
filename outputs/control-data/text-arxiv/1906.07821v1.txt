We present a study of the flavor changing decays φ → tc of the CP -even and CP -odd scalar
Flavons HF and AF at the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) in the framework
of an extension of the standard model that incorporates an extra complex singlet and invokes the
Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism with an Abelian flavor symmetry. A Monte Carlo analysis
of the signal
√
and the standard model background is presented for a center-of-mass energy of s = 14 TeV and
integrated luminosities in the 300-3000 fb−1 interval. Constraints on the parameter space of the
model from the Higgs boson coupling modifiers κi are obtained and used to evaluate the Flavon
decay widths and the gg → φ → tc production cross section. We analyze the dominant background
by considering realistic acceptance cuts, tagging and misstagging efficiencies, etc. It is found that
with the current integrated luminosity achieved at the LHC, the AF → tc decay is out of the
reach of detection. However, in the HL-LHC, such a decay could be at the reach of detection for
mAF = 200 − 500 GeV once an integrated luminosity of about 1000 fb−1 is achieved. On the other
hand, since the branching ratio of the HF → tc decay is suppressed by two orders of magnitude as
compared to that of the AF → tc decay, it seems to be out of the reach of detection even in the
HL-LHC.

INTRODUCTION

It is well known that the standard model (SM) has been successful in predicting results that have been experimentally
tested to a high accuracy, culminating with the recent discovery of a new scalar boson compatible with the SM Higgs
boson [2, 19, 30]. However, despite its success, some issues remain unexplained by the SM: the lack of a dark matter
candidate, the hierarchy problem, unification, the flavor problem etc. This encourages the study of SM extensions.
In the framework of the SM there are no tree-level flavor changing neutral currents (FCNCs), which are, however,
predicted by several SM extensions, being mediated by the Higgs boson or other new scalar or vector boson particles
[8]. In the context of these models, it is worth studying any signal that could give clues for new physics (NP), such
as the widely studied process φ → τ µ, with φ a CP -even or CP -odd scalar boson [8–10, 18, 20, 25, 31, 34, 35, 37].
FCNC signals can also arise from the top quark decays t → cX (X = φ, γ, g, Z, H) [22, 23, 26, 33], and from the less
studied decay of a new heavy scalar boson into a top-charm quark pair [3], which could be searched for at the LHC
and the future high luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). The latter aims to increase the LHC potential capacity by reaching a
luminosity up to L = 3000 fb−1 around 2035 [6]. The search for FCNC processes also have good prospects at a future
100 TeV hadron collider [7]. In this work we present a study of the φ → tc decay in a SM extension that incorporates a
complex singlet SF via the Froggatt-Nielsen (FN) mechanism, which assumes that above some scale MF a symmetry
(perhaps of Abelian type U (1)F ) forbids the Yukawa couplings, with the SM fermions charged under this symmetry.
However, the Yukawa couplings can arise through non-renormalizable operators. The scalar spectrum of this model
includes both a CP -even Flavon HF and a CP -odd Flavon AF . The former can mix with the SM Higgs boson when
the flavor scale is of the order of a few TeVs. Quite recently, the study of Flavon phenomenology at particle colliders
have attracted considerable attention [12, 14, 15, 24, 32]. Our study not only could serve as a strategy for the Flavon
search, but it can also be helpful to assess the order of magnitude of flavor violation mediated by this particles, which
is an indisputable signature of physics beyond the SM.
The organization of this paper is as follows: in Sec. II we describe the most relevant theoretical aspects of the
Froggatt-Nielsen singlet model (FNSM), which are necessary for our study. In Sec. III we obtain the constraints on
the model parameters from the most recent contraints on the Higgs boson coupling modifiers κi [38]. In addition, we
include the current bounds on Br(t → ch) in order to constraint the gφtc coupling. Sec. IV is devoted to the study of

2
our signal and the potential background as well as the strategy used to search for the φ → tc decay at the HL-LHC.
Finally the conclusion are presented in Section V.
II.

THE FROGGATT-NIELSEN COMPLEX SINGLET MODEL

We now focus on some relevant theoretical aspects of the FNSM. In Ref [16] a comprehensive analysis of the Higgs
potential is presented, along with constraints on the parameter space from the constraints on the Higgs boson signal
strengths and the oblique parameters, including a few benchmark scenarios. Also, the authors of Ref. [11] report a
study of the lepton flavor violating (LFV) Higgs boson decay h → `i `j in the scenario where there is CP violation
induced by a complex phase in the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the complex singlet.
A.

The scalar sector

In addition to the SM-like Higgs doublet, Φ, a FN complex singlet SF is introduced. They are given by


SF =

+ s + ip),

(1)
(2)

where v is the SM VEV and u is that of the FN complex singlet, whereas G+ and Gz are identified with the pseudoGoldstone bosons that become the longitudinal modes of the W and Z gauge bosons.
We consider a scalar potential that respects a global U (1) symmetry, with the Higgs doublet and the singlet
transforming as Φ → Φ and SF → eiθ SF . In general, such a scalar potential admits a complex VEV, namely,
hSF i0 = ue−iα , but in this work we consider the special case in which the Higgs potential is CP conserving, i.e. we
consider the limit with vanishing phase. Such a CP -conserving Higgs potential is given by:

(3)

where m2s2 stands for a U (1)-soft-breaking term, which is necessary to avoid the presence of a massless Goldstone
boson, as will be evident below. Once the minimization conditions are applied, the following relations are obtained:
m21 = v 2 λ1 + u2 λ11 ,
m2s1 = −2m2s2 + 2u2 λs + v 2 λ11 .

(4)
(5)

In this CP -conserving potential, the real and imaginary parts of the mass matrix do not mix. Thus, the mass
matrix for the real components can be written in the (φ0 , s) basis as

The corresponding mass eigenstates are obtained via the standard 2 × 2 rotation
φ0 = cos α h + sin α HF ,
s = − sin α h + cos α HF ,

with α a mixing angle. Here h is identified with the SM-like Higgs boson, with mass mh =125 GeV, whereas the mass
eigenstate HF is the CP -even Flavon.
As for the mass matrix of the imaginary parts, it is already diagonal in the (Gz , p) basis:

and the complex singlet. In Table I we show the coupling constants for the interactions of the SM-like Higgs boson
and the Flavons to fermions and gauge bosons.

III.

CONSTRAINTS ON THE FNSM PARAMETER SPACE

To evaluate the decay widths and production cross sections of the Flavons HF and AF via gluon fusion, we need
the bounds on the parameter space of our model, for which we use the most up-to-date constraints on the Higgs boson
data reported by the CMS collaboration [38]. The free parameters involved in our calculations are the following:
• The mixing angle cα .
• The VEV of the FN complex singlet u.
• The matrix element Z̃tc .

4
• The Flavon masses mHF and mAF .
It turn out that these parameters can be constrained via the Higgs boson coupling modifiers κi [38], which are
defined for a given Higgs boson production mode j → h or decay channel h → j as
κ2j = σj /σjSM

κ2j = Γj /ΓSM
j ,

or

(13)

where σjSM (ΓSM
j ) stands for the pure SM contributions, whereas σj (Γj ) includes new physics contributions. This
f
parametrization allows us to constrain the following FNSM parameters Z̃ij
, u, cα , as well as the Flavon masses mHF
and mAF . We show in Table II the best fit values of the Higgs boson coupling
modifiers κj obtained by combining

the measurements of Higgs boson couplings in proton-proton collisions at s=13 TeV [38].

Constraint on the mixing angle cα

We first constrain the mixing angle cα via the κZ and κW coupling modifiers, which are shown in Fig. 1 as a function
of cα . We also include the regions allowed by the experimental constraints at one and two standard deviations σ. We
observe that κW yields the most stringent constraint cα ≥ 0.95 at one σ, but at two σs both κZ and κW give the less
stringent constraint cα ≥ 0.8

Constraint on Z̃bb and Z̃tt

To calculate the Flavon production cross section via gluon fusion we need the Z̃qq (q = b, t) matrix elements as
well as the VEV u. We use the κt and κb coupling modifiers to constrain these parameters for two cα values, namely,
cα = 0.9, which favors FCNC effects mediated by the SM-like Higgs boson, and cα = 0.99, which favors FCNC effects
mediated by the CP -even Flavon HF , but yields suppressed FCNCs effects mediated by the SM-like Higgs boson. In
Fig. 2 we show the allowed region at 95 % C.L. by the experimental constraints on κt and κb in the u vs Z̃qq planes.
We observe that the upper allowed values of the matrix elements Z̃qq increase as u increases, which is expected since
the corrections from the FNSM to the Higgs boson couplings ghqq behave as ∼ Z̃qq /u.

In our analysis we assume a scenario in which cα = 0.99, but we must be careful to avoid dangerous corrections to
the couplings of the SM Higgs boson, so we use the values Z̃bb = 0.01 and Z̃tt = 0.4, which yield corrections of the
order of O(2%) to the SM couplings ghbb and ghtt .

3.

Constraint on Z̃tc

So far, we only have considered the bound on the diagonal couplings to the heavy quarks. However, we need a
bound on the Z̃tc matrix element in order to evaluate the φ → tc decay. To our knowledge, there are no process
from which we can extract a stringent bound on Z̃tc , but we can assess its order of magnitude by considering the
upper limits Br(t → ch) < 0.16 % [1] and Br(t → ch) < 0.47 % [39] reported by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations,
respectively. We also consider the bound obtained in Ref. [36] by extrapolating the number of events for the signal
and background from 36.1 fb−1 to 3000 fb−1 , assuming that the experimental details and analysis remain unchanged.
Such an expected upper limit is given by Br(t → tc) < 0.00769 %. In Fig. 3 we show the areas allowed in the u vs
Z̃tc plane by the upper limit on Br(t → tc) obtained by the ATLAS collaboration and the expected limit of Ref. [36]
for cα =0.99, and 0.95.
In our analysis we assume the scenario with cα = 0.99, namely, suppressed FCNCs mediated by the SM-like Higgs
boson. Under this assumption we consider the following two scenarios for Z̃tc :
(a) Conservative scenario: Z̃tc = 0.3 and u = 1 TeV.
(b) Optimistic scenario: Z̃tc = 1 and u = 2 TeV.

SEARCH FOR φ → tc DECAYS AT THE HL-LHC
A.

Flavon decays

We now present the behavior of the branching ratios of the main Flavon decay channels, which were obtained
via our own code that implements the analytical expressions for the corresponding decay widths [9]. A cross-check
was done by comparing our results with those obtained via CalcHEP, in which we implemented the corresponding
Feynman rules via the LanHEP package. In Fig. 4 we show the branching ratios of the decays of the CP -odd Flavon
as functions of mAF for the parameter values of Table III, in the scenario with u = 1 TeV and Z̃tc = 0.3. As the
CP -odd Flavon does not couple to gauge bosons at the tree-level, its dominant decay modes are AF → tt, AF → tc,
and AF → bb, with a branching ratio at the O(0.1) level, whereas the branching ratio for the decay AH → τ µ is
one order of magnitude below. Other decay channels such as AF → γγ, AF → Zγ and AF → µµ are considerably
suppressed.
As far as the CP -even Flavon is concerned, the branching ratios for its main decay channels are presented in Fig.
5 for the same parameter values used for the CP -odd Higgs Flavon decays. We observe that the dominant HF decay
channels are HF → W W and HF → ZZ, whereas the subdominant decay channels are HF → tt and HF → tc, whose
branching ratios can be of the order of O(10−2 − 10−3 ) once they are kinematically allowed. Other decay modes such
as HF → bb, HF → τ µ, HF → γγ and HF → gg have branching ratios ranging from 10−6 to 10−4 , whereas the decays
HF → Zγ and HF → µµ are very suppressed.

Production cross sections

We now present a Monte Carlo analysis for the production of both the CP -even and the CP -odd Flavons at the
LHC via gluon fusion gg → φ (φ = HF , AF ), followed by the FCNC decay φ → tc. We apply realistic kinematic
cuts and consider tagging and misstagging efficiencies. We then obtain the statistical significance, which could be
experimentally confirmed. A similar study of the φ → τ µ decay within the same theoretical framework can be found
in [9].
We first present in Fig. 6 the σ(pp → φ → tc) (φ = HF , AF ) cross sections with no cuts, for which we use CalcHEP
with the CT10 parton distribution functions [29]. The number of events for an integrated luminosity of L = 300 fb−1
are shown in the right axis of each plot. We note that for a CP -odd Flavon with a mass of about 350 GeV, there
would be about 3 × 105 signal events at the LHC, which would decrease to about 2 × 105 for a CP -even Flavon.
When mφ increases up to 1000 GeV, there would be only about 1000 AF → tc events and about 400 HF → tc events.
We thus only consider the case of the CP -odd Flavon in the following as the detection of the CP -even Flavon decay
HF → tc seems to be troublesome even at the HL-LHC.

Kinematic cuts

We now turn to the Monte Carlo simulation, for which we use Madgraph [4], with the corresponding Feynman rules
generated via LanHEP. The signal events were generated at LO in QCD and the signal events at NLO with the aid
of MadGraph5 and MadGraph5 aMC@NLO [5], respectively, interfaced
with Pythia 6 [40].
√
The signal and the main background events, generated at s = 14 TeV with integrated luminosities in the L =
300 − 3000 fb−1 interval, are as follows:
• SIGNAL: The signal is gg → AF → tc → b`ν` c with ` = e, µ. We generated 105 events scanning over
mAF ∈ [200, 1000] TeV and considered the parameter values of Table III.
• BACKGROUND: The dominant SM background arises from the final states W jj + W bb̄, tb + tj and tt̄,

in which either one of the two leptons is missed in the semi-leptonic top quark decays or two of the four jets
are missed when one of the top quarks decays semi-leptonically. We generated 105 events for each background
process at NLO in QCD.
The kinematic cuts imposed to study a possible evidence of the φ → tc at the HL-LHC are as follows.
• We requiere two jets with |η j | < 2.5 and pjT > 30 GeV, one them is tagged as a b-jet.
• We require one isolated lepton (e or µ) with |η ` | < 2.5 and p`T > 20 GeV.

• Since a neutrino is included in the final state, we consider 40 GeV of missing transverse energy E
The kinematic analysis was done via MadAnalysis5 and for detector simulations we use Delphes [27]. As far as the
jet reconstruction we use the jet finding package FastJet [17] and the anti-kT algorithm. We include also the following
tagging and misstagging efficiences. We consider the b-tagging efficiency b = 50% and to account for the probability
that a c-jet is misstagged as a b-jet, we consider√c = 14%, whereas for any other jet we use j = 1%.
We now compute the signal significance NS / NS + NB , where NS (NB ) are the number of signal (background)
events once the kinematic cuts were applied. We show in Fig. the contour plots of the signal significance as a function
of the HL-LHC luminosity and the CP -odd flavon mass. We use the values for the model parameters shown in the
Table III and consider the two scenarios described above for Z̃tc . We can conclude that scenario (a) would require
an integrated luminosity of the order of 2000 fb−1 to claim evidence of the CP −odd Flavon decay AF → tc for mAF
in the ∼ 300 − 400 GeV interval, whereas scenario (b) is more promising as it would require an integrated luminosity
of about 1000 fb−1 (1800 fb−1 ) for mAF = 200 (500) GeV. By increasing the integrated luminosity by at least 50% a
cross-check could be performed. We can also observe that at the end of the HL-LHC era the AF → tc signal would
reach a significance as large as ∼ 8σ as long the proper kinematic cuts are applied.

CONCLUSIONS

We study an extension of the SM with a complex singlet that invokes the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism with an
Abelian flavor symmetry. Such a model predicts CP -even and CP -odd Flavons that mediate FCNCs at the tree-level
and thus can decay as φ → tc (φ = HF , AF ), which is the focus of our work. We found the region of the parameter
space consistent with the experimental constraints on the Higgs boson coupling modifiers, which is then used to
evaluate the φ → tc decays along with the pp → φ → tc production cross section at the HL-LHC via gluon fusion. It
is found that the detection of the HF → tc decay seems to be troublesome even at the HL-LHC, so we focus on the
study of the AF → tc decay, which seems to be more promising. We present a Monte Carlo analysis of both the signal
pp → AF → tc → b`ν` c + X and the main standard model background, which allow us to assess the possibility that
this decay could be detected. It is found that for the integrated luminosities expected at the end of the LHC era, the
signal of the AF → tc decay is beyond the reach of detection. However, with the advent of the HL-LCH operating
with luminosities in the L ∼ 1000 − 3000 fb−1 interval, it could be possible to detect the AF → tc signal up the
5–8 σ level for a Flavon mass in the range of 200-500 GeV as long as appropriate kinematic cuts are imposed. The

FIG. 7: Contour plot for the signal significance as a function of the luminosity and the CP −odd flavon mass, mAF , for the
two scenarios described in the text, namely, scenario (a) u = 1 TeV and Z̃tc = 0.3, and scenario (b) u = 2 TeV and Z̃tc = 1.

chances of detecting the signal could get boosted if the tagging and misstagging efficiencies are improved [21]. The
prospect of the HL-LHC [13], which would operate at a center-of-mass energy of 28 TeV and an integrated luminosity
of L = 12000 fb−1 , is very promising for the search of new particles such as the Flavons, and so is the potential
construction of a 100 TeV pp collider [7].
