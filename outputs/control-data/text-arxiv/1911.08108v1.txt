We report crystal growth and below 2.5K superconductivity of Nb0.25Bi2Se3. These
crystals are grown by self flux method. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of as grown
crystal flake shows (00l) plane (c-orientation) growth. The Rietveld refinement of crushed
crystal powder XRD (PXRD) pattern confirms the phase purity of the studied sample having
R-3m space group of rhombohedral crystalline structure. The Raman spectrum of the studied
Nb0.25Bi2Se3 crystal distinctly shows three well defined vibrational modes in terms of A 11g,
Eg2, A21g at around 72, 129 and 173cm-1, which are slightly shifted in comparison to pure
Bi2Se3. Magnetization studies in terms of field cooled (FC) and Zero field cooled (ZFC)
magnetic susceptibility measurements show the diamagnetic transition (Tconset) of the
compound at around 2.5K and near saturation of the same below around 2.1K. The isothernal
magnetization (MH) being taken at 2K, revealed the lower critical field (Hc1) of around 50Oe
and the upper critical field (Hc2) of 900Oe. It is clear the studied Nb0.25Bi2Se3 is a bulk
superconductor. The superconducting critical parameters thus calculated viz. the coherence
length, upper and lower critical fields and superconducting transition temperature for as
grown Nb0.25Bi2Se3 single crystal are reported here.

Introduction
Topological insulators (TIs) with extraordinary quantum properties in terms of their
highly conducting surface and bulk insulating transport properties deep within due to time
reversal symmetry (TRS) protected surface/edge states had attracted the attention of
condensed matter physics community at large [1-3]. Besides several other quantum
properties, more recently superconductivity could be induced in TIs by application of
hydrostatic pressure [4], superconducting proximity effect, and by doping or intercalation of
suitable elements like Cu [5,6], Sr [7,8], Nb [9,10], Tl [11], and Pd [12] etc. Understanding of
the surface conductivity of TIs had yet been to some extent clear in terms of Dirac point
driven electronic structure. The superconductivity of TIs further complicates the situation in
terms of the copper pairs being formed by the edge/surface states driven carriers.
Superconducting TIs do further host some novel properties besides the known usual
superconductivity phenomenon, viz zero biased conduction peak [13], quantized thermal hall
conductivity [14], anomalous Josephson effect [15], odd frequency Cooper pairs [16], and
Majorana Fermions [17] etc. It is clear that the superconducting TIs are very much a suitable
choice for fundamental research related to quantum phenomenon [4-12].
Keeping in view, that Bi2Se3 is one of the most studied topological insulators, in
current short letter, we report the crystal growth and characterization of Nb0.25Bi2Se3
superconductor. Although scant reports exist on superconducting TIs [4-17], yet it is
important to reproduce the new observations in different laboratories. This is main purpose
of the short letter concluding that superconductivity exists in Nb0.25Bi2Se3 below 2.5K with
lower and upper critical fields at 2 K of around 50Oe and 900Oe respectively. This is in
conformity with earlier results [9, 10].
Experimental
Nb0.25Bi2Se3 single crystal was grown by self-flux method in simple automated
furnace via solid state reaction route, as reported by some of us recently [18]. The schematic
heat treatment of Nb0.25Bi2Se3 single crystal is shown in left side inset of Fig. 1. One of the
important issues is to not only very slow cooling (10C/hrs) from 9500C melt to 6000C, but to
quench in ice after annealing for 24 hours at 6000C. This is necessary to avoid the segregation
2

of Nb as an impurity in the matrix. Details can be followed from ref. 18. XRD on
mechanically cleaved crystal flake and powder form had been carried out using Rigaku made
Mini Flex II X-ray diffractometer having Cu Kα radiation of 1.5418Å wavelength. Raman
spectra of as grown Nb0.25Bi2Se3 single crystal are recorded at room temperature using the
Renishaw Raman Spectrometer. Magnetization studies are done on PPMS (Physical Property
measurement System) from Quantum Design (QD).
Results and Discussion

Figure 1 depicts the Rietveld refinement of gently crushed powder XRD pattern of the
Nb0.25Bi2Se3. The studied as grown crystal is crystallized in rhombohedral structure
having R-3m space group [19]. All the observed diffraction lines are indexed on the XRD
pattern. Hardly any un-reacted peak is seen within X-Ray limit. The fitted parameter (χ2)
value is found to be ~7.43, which is reasonably good as far as Reitveld PXRD is concerned.
Atom positions obtained from Rietveld refinement of PXRD data are Bi [0, 0, 0.4018(6)] &
Se [0, 0, 0.2086(5)] and lattice parameters of the grown Nb0.25Bi2Se3 single crystal are a = b =
4.1458(3)Å & c = 28.5759(2)Å of α = β = 90o & γ = 120o. The VESTA software drawn
representative unit cell of the studied Nb0.25Bi2Se3 single crystal can be seen in ref. 18. The
studied crystal morphology as seen from Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) was seen to
be laminar type and the stoichiometric formula being calculated from EDAX analysis is close
to the nominal compositional value, for details see ref. 18. The right hand side inset of Fig. 1
shows the XRD pattern of crystal flake of as grown Nb0.25Bi2Se3 single crystal confirming the
crystalline nature of the same growing in single plane i.e. (00l) only. The intense peaks are
seen for (003n) with n = 1, 2, 3…. etc.

Figure 2 shows the Raman spectrum for both reported [20] pure Bi2Se3 and the
studied Nb0.25Bi2Se3 crystal, one over the other. Clearly alike Bi2Se3, the studied Nb0.25Bi2Se3
crystal also shows the characteristic vibrational modes for these systems i.e. A11g, Eg2, A21g.
These modes are seen at 70.66, 130.20 and 174.547cm-1 for pure Bi2Se3 and at 70.29, 129.99
and 172.23cm-1 for Nb0.25Bi2Se3 respectively. The Raman Shift peaks are observed to move
to lower frequency side in spectra, while the intensity of the peaks found to be decreasing for
A11g and A21g and increasing for Eg2 mode. The observed lower Raman Shift values for

3

studied Nb0.25Bi2Se3 crystal may be due to intercalation of Nb atoms residing in vander waals
gap between two quintuple layers weakening the bonding forces [19-21].
Figure 3 depicts the magnetization versus temperature response of studied
Nb0.25Bi2Se3 crystal under field cooled (FC) and zero field cooled (ZFC) conditions under an
applied field of 20Oe. A clear diamagnetic transition appears in both FC and ZFC plots with
a critical temperature near 2.5K, confirming the onset of superconductivity in studied
Nb0.25Bi2Se3 crystal. The diamagnetic signal observed at 2.5K saturates at around 2.1K, thus
indicating the superconducting transition width to be around 0.4K. Lower inset in Fig. 3
shows MH curve for studied Nb0.25Bi2Se3 crystal at 2, 2.2 and 2.4K i.e., below the critical
temperature. The wide open MH plots confirm the observation of bulk superconductivity
right up to 2.4K. The lower critical field Hc1 is found to be 50Oe and upper critical field Hc2
being 900Oe at 2K. The same are 8.25Oe and 400Oe at 2.2K and 7.10Oe and 200Oe at 2.4K.
The lower critical field (Hc1) is defined as the deviation of linear diamagnetic plot towards
mixed state and is marked with a straight line in the inset of Fig. 3. The upper critical field
(Hc2) is roughly known to coincide with the irreversibility field of a type-II superconductor
isothermal magnetization (MH) plot. This is marked on corresponding plot in inset of Fig. 3.
It is clear from Fig. 3, inset that the studied Nb0.25Bi2Se3 crystal is a type-II superconductor.
Critical field for the studied Nb0.25Bi2Se3 crystal as calculated from the formula Hc =
(Hc1*Hc2)1/2, is found to be 212.13Oe. at 2K Upper critical field at 0K i.e. Hc2(0) is measured
by using the GL equation given below, where t represent reduced temperature T/Tc.

Hc2(0) is found to be 4.1*103 Oe i.e. around 0.4Tesla at 2K. Ginzburg-Landau parameter
Kappa (κ) is determined by using formula Hc2(0)=κ*21/2*Hc and is found to be 13.66 which
is far greater than 1/2½, hence confirming the type-II superconductivity of studied
Nb0.25Bi2Se3 crystal. Coherence length of Nb0.25Bi2Se3 crystal is determined by using the
formula

where Φ0 is flux quanta. The value of flux quanta is 2.0678 x 10-

15

Wb. Thus calculated coherence length ξ(0) of studied Nb0.25Bi2Se3 crystal is found to be

2.83Å. Further, penetration depth λ(0) is determined by kappa parameter using formula κ =
4

λ(0)/ξ(0) which is found to be 38.65Å at 2K. The fundamental superconducting parameters of
studied Nb0.25Bi2Se3 crystal at 2K are given in Table 1.
Conclusion
In summary, in this the short letter we studied low temperature magnetic properties of
Nb0.25Bi2Se3 single crystal which confirms that the sample is superconducting. Various
superconductivity critical parameters viz. critical field, kappa parameter, coherence length
and penetration depth are calculated. Studied Nb0.25Bi2Se3 single crystal is a Type-II
superconductor. The phase purity of the grown crystal is confirmed by PXRD. The Raman
shift in vibration modes due to Nb intercalation is also seen and briefly discussed.
