ABSTRACT
We characterize the incidence and intensity of low-level super-massive black hole activity within the Fornax
cluster, through X-ray observations of the nuclei of 29 quiescent early-type galaxies. Using the Chandra
X-ray Telescope, we target 17 galaxies from the Hubble Space Telescope Fornax Cluster Survey, down to a
uniform (3σ) limiting X-ray luminosity threshold of 5 · 1038 ergs−1 , which we combine with deeper, archival
observations for an additional 12 galaxies. A nuclear X-ray point-source is detected in 11 out of 29 targets.
After accounting for the low mass X-ray binary contamination to the nuclear X-ray signal, the X-ray active
fraction is measured at 26.6% ± 9.6%. The results from this analysis are compared to similar investigations
targeting quiescent early types in the Virgo cluster, as well as the field. After correcting for the different mass
distributions, the measured Fornax active fraction is less than the field fraction, at more than 3σ, confirming
that the funneling of gas to the nuclear regions of cluster members is inhibited compared to those galaxies in
the field. At the same time, we find no statistically significant difference between Fornax and Virgo galaxies,
with only marginal evidence for a lower active fraction in Fornax (1 σ); if real, owing to Fornax’s higher
galaxy number density, this could indicate that galaxy-galaxy interactions are more effective at gas removal
than galaxy-gas effects.

1. INTRODUCTION

The growth of super-massive black holes (SMBHs) appears
to be anti-hierarchical, in the sense that active accretion is
concentrated in higher and lower mass SMBHs at earlier and
later cosmological times, respectively (e.g., Heckman et al.
2004; Shankar 2009; Bongiorno et al. 2012). The peak of
the quasar space densities around z'2 (e.g., Hasinger et al.
< 108 yr quasar lifetimes (Yu & Tremaine
(2005)), and the ∼
2002), imply that “inactive” galactic nuclei host SMBHs accreting at highly sub-Eddington levels in a post-quasar phase
(e.g., Soltan 1982; Croton et al. 2006; Hopkins et al. 2007).
While several studies (e.g., Pellegrini 2005; Soria et al. 2006;
Boroson et al. 2011) have provided a detailed census of lowlevel SMBH ativity within the local universe, including as a
function of the host galaxy properties (Pellegrini 2010), the
impact of environment on the occurrence and intensity of
highly inefficient SMBH activity remains unclear.
Low-level accretion-powered activity in nearby galaxies
may be detected efficiently in sensitive, high spatial resolution X-ray observations, provided that one accounts properly
for contamination from bright X-ray binaries to the overall
nuclear emission. This issue of contamination can be substantially alleviated by restricting the search for highly inefficient

nuclei to (i) early-type galaxies, as they conveniently avoid
the brighter high-mass X-ray binaries produced concurrently
with star formation, as well as (ii) within ∼30 Mpc, such that
the average stellar mass enclosed within the instrument Point
Spread Function (PSF) allows for a low probability of contamination from low-mass X-ray binaries9 (Gallo et al. 2010;
Miller et al. 2012a).
The properties of early-type galaxies in sparsely populated
regions are distinct from their counterparts in denser environments: relative to cluster/group sources, field early-type
galaxies face reduced ram pressure stripping (Gavazzi et al.
2010; Shin et al. 2012) and, on average, contain more cold
gas and tend to have younger stellar populations (e.g., Thomas
et al. 2005). Proposed mechanisms for inhibiting star formation within clusters/groups include gas removal (e.g., starvation through ram pressure stripping, tidal stripping, or thermal
evaporation; Treu et al. 2003; Moran et al. 2007) or morphological quenching (i.e., stabilization of a gas disk through the
build-up of a stellar spheroid; Martig et al. 2009). Such processes would operate at low efficiency within the field. More
recent studies find that the fractional rate for AGN selected by
X-ray luminosity is similar between field and cluster samples
(Martini et al. 2007; Haggard et al. 2010). However, such investigations are concerned with bona fide AGN, i.e., with nuclear X-ray luminosities in excess of around 1043 erg s−1 . In
a first attempt to bridge the gap between AGN and formally
inactive galaxies, and characterize SMBH activity down to
Eddington ratios as low as 10−7 , and also as a function of
environment, our group carried out the AMUSE-Virgo and
AMUSE-field Chandra surveys10 . Together, these surveys include 203 optically selected local early-type galaxies, spanning 4 decades in mass, that are unbiased with respect to nu9 While the normalization of the X-ray luminosity function for high mass
X-ray binaries scales with star formation rate, that of low-mass X-ray binaries
scales with stellar mass (Grimm et al. 2003; Gilfanov 2004).

clear properties (Gallo et al. 2008, 2010; Miller et al. 2012b,a;
Leipski et al. 2012; Baldassare et al. 2014; Plotkin et al. 2014;
Miller et al. 2015). These programs demonstrated a clear difference in the incidence and intensity of nuclear X-ray activity between galaxies living in isolation vs. a dense cluster
such as Virgo: after accounting for the different distributions
in host galaxy stellar mass, 32 ± 6% of the Virgo targets are
found to host an active nuclear SMBH (Gallo et al. 2010), vs.
50 ± 7% for the field (Miller et al. 2012a). Also, the field
early-types possess greater nuclear X-ray luminosities, at a
given host stellar mass, than their cluster counterparts (Miller
et al. 2012b). Additionally, a Bayesian analysis, which includes luminosity upper limits, shows that, for both samples,
the average nuclear X-ray luminosity scales with host stellar
mass as M? +0.8±0.1 . Consequently, the average specific accretion rate hLX /M? i scales with stellar mass as M? −0.2±0.1 ,
implying that black holes in lower mass galaxies tend toward
higher LX /M? ratios compared to higher mass ones (Miller
et al. 2012b). This is not consistent with the uniform specific
Eddington ratio distribution found for AGN (Aird et al. 2012;
Bongiorno et al. 2012) and implies that, in the local universe,
SMBH feeding is relatively more abundant/efficient at the low
luminosity end of the distribution.
Combined, the X-ray and optical diagnostics point toward
the following scenario: Small amounts of gas, possibly from
residual star formation, can continue to fuel a SMBH within
the nuclei of isolated field galaxies well after the assembly of
the major nuclear star cluster mass, whereas gas is more likely
to be depleted from dense cluster members (Baldassare et al.
2014). A remaining uncertainty lies in which environmental
effect is primarily responsible for depleting gas: ram pressure
stripping or galaxy-galaxy interactions. At an average distance of 20 Mpc (Blakeslee et al. 2009), the Fornax cluster
offers the only opportunity to test and discriminate between
different environmental effects on low level SMBH accretion;
at the same time, Fornax is more representative of groups and
poor galaxy clusters, where the majority of galaxies reside. In
fact, Virgo and Fornax show several important differences that
warrant comparisons. Fornax is more regular in shape (e.g.,
Scharf et al. 2005), and likely more dynamically evolved, than
its northern counterpart. It is also substantially smaller and
denser, with a total mass of ' 7 ± 2 · 1013 M (vs. 4 − 7 · 1014
for Virgo), a core radius of 0.4 Mpc (∼ 40% that of Virgo),
and a central galaxy density twice as large. The intra-cluster
temperature is about twice as high in Virgo (k T ' 2.6 keV)
than it is in Fornax (k T ' 1.2 keV).
If ram-stripping (galaxy-gas) were primarily responsible
for the lower X-ray active fraction and average nuclear Xray luminosity in Virgo as compared to the field sample, then
we would expect the active fraction and average X-ray luminosity of Fornax galaxies to be higher than in Virgo (and yet
lower than the field). This is because ram pressure scales
with the product ρ × σ 2 , where ρ is the intra-cluster gas
density and σ is the cluster velocity dispersion; the central gas density and velocity dispersion of Virgo are about
four and two times higher, respectively, than Fornax (Paolillo et al. 2002; Scharf et al. 2005), making Virgo about
15 times more effective at ram pressure stripping compared to Fornax. In contrast, galaxy-galaxy deceleration
induced by dynamical friction scales as n/σ 2 , where n is
the galaxy number density. Since n is twice as high for
Fornax (Davies et al. 2013), the effect of dynamical friction is expected to be a factor of about 10 higher in Fornax
than it is in Virgo.

This paper is structured as follows: In § 2 we describe the
Fornax sample and Chandra data reduction procedures. Results from the X-ray data analysis are presented in § 3, including a quantitative assessment of the low-mass X-ray binary contamination to the nuclear X-ray emission (§ 3.1), and
a linear regression analysis to probe the scaling of nuclear
X-ray luminosity with host stellar mass (§ 3.2). In § 4, we
carry out a mass-weighted comparison between the Fornax
and Virgo/field sample, and summarize our results and conclusions in § 5.
2. SAMPLE SELECTION AND DATA ANALYSIS

Similarly to the Virgo and field Chandra surveys, a sample of Fornax early types that is unbiased with respect to nuclear properties is necessary to carry out a comparative Xray based investigation. The Fornax Cluster Survey11 (hereafter ACS-FCS) is a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Survey program that targets an unbiased
sample of 43 early type Fornax members spanning between
< B < 15.5, corresponding to a factor of 275 in blue lu9.4 ∼
T ∼
minosity (Jordán et al. 2007). It is constructed from the Fornax Cluster Catalog (340 members over 40 deg2 ) by selecting morphological types E, S0, SB0, dE, deN, dS0 and dS0N
down to a limiting BT -magnitude brighter than 15.5. With
the goal to characterize direct environmental effects (galaxygalaxy vs. galaxy-gas) in SMBH accretion to the same depth
as in Virgo, we acquired Chandra imaging observations of a
sub-sample of the FCS targets.
Measurements by the ACSFCS group (Jordán et al.
2007) were used to estimate synthetic Vega B-band magnitudes of the host galaxies (since the synthetic Vega B-band
is close in wavelength to the g0 band, the transformation
introduces only a minimal uncertainty of order 0.02 mag
at most). Stellar masses are then estimated from the g0
and z0 band AB model magnitudes following Table 7 in
Bell et al. (2003).
Chandra ACIS imaging data are available for 29 out of
the 43 early type galaxies that compose the FCS sample:
17 were acquired as part of a dedicated Cycle 17 program
(17700126; PI: Gallo) where each galaxy was observed for
∼ 5 ks, corresponding to an X-ray sensitivity threshold of
∼ 5 × 1038 erg s−1 (we shall hereafter refer to these short,
Cycle 17 pointings as “snapshot” observations), and 12 galaxies were covered in archival Chandra observations, in which
they are within 10 arcminutes from the aimpoint. For cases
in which a galaxy was covered by multiple observations, we
prioritize those observations where (i) the galaxy optical center was closest to the aimpoint, and (ii) with the lowest exposure time, so as to match the sensitivity limit of the Virgo
and field surveys (which enables us to probe nuclear X-ray
activity down to a few 1038 erg s−1 , i.e. the Eddington limit
for a ∼5 M black hole). The properties of the sample are
summarized in Table 1.
Using the Chandra Interactive Analysis of Observation
(CIAO) software, version 4.9, and the calibration database
version 4.7.8, we analyze the observations in a systematic
fashion following the general approach outlined in Gallo et al.
(2008) and Miller et al. (2012a), modulo an updated procedure for determining the optimal aperture size for measuring
the flux (see below). For the 17 galaxies with snapshot observations, we first create new level 2 event and bad-pixel files,
and filter the energy to within 0.5-8 keV where the ACIS is

best calibrated and the background contribution is minimal.
An initial X-ray source list is created for each observation
by running the Mexican-Hat wavelet source detection tool
WAVDETECT , using the default significance threshold of 10−6
(corresponding to roughly one spurious detection per chip),
and wavelet pixel scales of 1, 1.414, 2, 2.828, and 4.
A translational astrometric correction is applied by crossreferencing the identified sources with the USNO-B1 catalog
using the CIAO WCS MATCH script. The resulting transformation matrices are used to update the aspect solution files
and the coordinate parameters in all the event files. Three observations lack sufficient matches for a shift computation and
are not corrected.
We search the background light curve for periods of anomalously high activity using the CIAO DEFLARE script, with
200 s binning. The script makes use of an iterative sigmaclipping algorithm that identifies background intervals > 3σ
off the mean value. A “good time” interval is created for each
observation, and visually inspected for possible artifacts, before being applied as a filter to the level 2 event file. We then
generate an updated point-source list, rerunning WAVDETECT
on the filtered event file, and search for an X-ray source at a
position consistent with the optical center coordinates of the
galaxy.
For the 12 galaxies with archival data, the same general
data reduction procedures are employed. However, for galaxies with stellar masses above 1010 M , we limit our analysis
to the energy range 2-8 keV, so as to minimize diffuse freefree emission from hot gas (at the temperature and luminosity
of the Fornax cluster, the contribution from thermal emission

above 2 keV in the aperture sizes that we use is negligible).
We then use the CIAO SRCFLUX script to compute net
count rates and convert them into fluxes (fX ), with an automatic aperture correction. We also devise and adopt a new
set of criteria to minimize contamination from an unresolved
“glow” of low-mass X-ray binaries to the nuclear X-ray signal – as opposed to X-ray emission from a single, centrally
peaked X-ray source. The Chandra on-axis PSF has an approximately 80% encircled energy fraction at r<0.500 ; a nuclear point source would therefore have the majority of its
counts come from within this region. Thus, for each nuclear
detection reported by WAVDETECT, we choose different apertures depending on the number of counts detected within 0.500
of the nominal galaxy center position, as follows: case (i) ≥10
counts; case (ii) <10 counts; case (iii) no statistically significant detection within r=0.5 00 . In the first case, we use a radius
r≤0.500 , yielding an error of .30% in fX compared to the case
where fX is measured from a (typical) 200 radius extraction region. In the second case, we use a circular region with radius
r=200 . In the case where the number of expected counts from
low mass X-ray binaries (estimated using the luminosity function outlined in § 3.1) within a 200 radius exceeds the measured
number of counts, we accept the larger error and use again a
r= 0.500 radius extraction region, to minimize the contribution from the glow. In the third case, we measure fX from
the smallest aperture that gives a statistically significant detection. Background counts are extracted from a source-free (i.e.,
with off nuclear X-ray sources, when present, masked off) annulus of inner and outer radii of 2000 and 3000 and centered
on the X-ray source centroid position in the event of a detec-

4
tion, and/or the nominal galaxy optical center position in the
case of a non detection. For the purpose of converting count
rates into (0.3-10 keV) fluxes, we adopt an absorbed power
law model with photon index Γ = 2 and use PROP COLDEN
to estimate the neutral hydrogen-equivalent column density
for each galaxy. For the 12 archival galaxies, because many
observations are off-axis, only those in which the galaxy of
interest is close to the aimpoint (FCC 21, 213, 219, 167) are
used in applying the aperture protocol above. For the remaining archival detection (FCC 184), a default aperture of 200 is
used. X-ray luminosities/limits are listed in Table 1 for the
whole sample, whereas Table 2 gives the coordinates of the
detected nuclear X-ray sources. In line with previous work
by our group (Gallo et al. 2010; Miller et al. 2012a,b), errors are taken to be 0.1 on logLX and 0.1 on logM? /M ,
in both cases dominated by the uncertainty in the distance
rather than measurement error.
3. FORNAX NUCLEAR X-RAY EMISSION RESULTS
3.1. Active fraction

The simplest estimate of the active fraction is the fraction
of galaxies with nuclear X-ray sources, which corresponds to
38% for the Fornax galaxies (11 out of 29). The detection
rate for the snapshot survey is 6/17 (35%), whereas among
the archival data it is 5/12 (42%). The slightly higher detection fraction for archival data could be due to the higher
sensitivity (as most archival detections have luminosities below the snapshot sensitivity), but selection bias must also be
important, since several of the observations are of well known
AGN (such as NGC 1316=FCC21, which is Fornax A, and
NGC 1399=FCC213, which is the central galaxy)12
There is a larger detection fraction for more massive galaxies, with a nuclear source detected in 8/14 galaxies with stellar
mass > 1010 M . The average nuclear `X =log[LX /(erg s−1 )]
in the archival and snapshot samples are 38.3 and 38.9, respectively, and this is likely a result in the difference in sensitivity, as 4/5 of the detected archival sources have luminosities
below the snapshot sensitivity. The above values, however,
refer to the measured X-ray luminosities under the implicit
assumption that they trace low level accretion-powered emission form a SMBH. We examine the validity of this assumption below.
3.2. LMXB contribution assessment

With regards to the origin of the nuclear X-ray signal, it is
highly unlikely that any detected source is a coincident background source. The logN -logS distribution given by Moretti
et al. (2003) implies a negligible probability of chance coincidence, with values between 10−4 and 10−5 . X-ray emission
arising from stellar tidal disruption within the nuclear region
is another possible origin (Auchettl et al. 2018), though because of its scarcity, given our sample size its influence on
our analysis is negligible. Thus, we focus on quantifying the
probabilistic contribution to the nuclear X-ray signal from Xray binaries, assessing the nature of the detected nuclear X-ray
emission on a case-by-case basis (for reference, 0.500 , i.e.the
Chandra PSF FWHM, corresponds to about 50 pc at an average distance of 20 Mpc).
12 Per our assessment, both are associated to low probability AGN. This is
due to a combination of the (i) large enclosed nuclear masses and (ii) low Xray luminosity values, in both galaxies. Combined, these yield a high LMXB
contamination fraction probability. We stress that, for both galaxies, strong
evidence for an actively accreting SMBH comes from diagnostics other than
X-rays.

Both the number and cumulative luminosity of low-mass
X-ray binaries (LMXBs) scale proportionally with their host
galaxy’s stellar mass, M? (Grimm et al. 2002; Gilfanov 2004;
Humphrey & Buote 2008), while, for high mass X-ray binaries, they scale with the galaxy’s star formation rate (Grimm
et al. 2003; Lehmer et al. 2010; Mineo et al. 2012). The
star-formation rate in early-type galaxies, while poorly constrained, is undoubtedly very low, so we can safely ignore
the contribution from the latter, and focus on quantifying the
LMXB contribution to the nuclear signal.
The differential X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of
LMXBs in early types is well represented by a broken power
law of the form dN/dL = Ki L−αi , where i = 1, 2, 3 and αi
has different (and progressively steeper) values for three different luminosity intervals in the range 37.3<`X <40.7, and
Ki is the normalization constant (cf. Gilfanov 2004).
In line with previous works (Foord et al. 2017 and references therein), for each galaxy we start by normalizing the
LMXB XLF to the stellar mass enclosed within the nuclear
region, M?,n . We operate under the assumption that the
stellar mass content is traced by the galaxy optical surface
brightness, which we compute by performing standard aperture photometry on the publicly available FCS ACS images
in the F850LP band. For the purpose of determining the radial extent of the nuclear region, we follow the same criteria
as described above for the nuclear X-ray source count extraction region (i.e., the nuclear region here is determined by the
aperture size used in §2; for case (ii), however, an aperture
radius of 0.500 is used). We find nuclear fractional luminosity
values ranging between 2.5% (FCC 43) and 48% (FCC 55).
For each galaxy, the nuclear stellar mass M?,n is estimated by
multiplying the total stellar mass by the fraction of light from
the nucleus, assuming a constant mass-to-light ratio across the
galaxy. New XLF normalization constants Ki∗ are then calculated for each energy interval based on the enclosed stellar
mass.
The expected average total number of LMXBs within
each galaxy nucleus, and their average total luminosity, can
beRcalculated from this re-normalized
R XLF as hNLMXB,tot i
= (dN/dL)dL and hLLMXB,tot i= L(dN/dL)dL, respectively. These expected average values, along with the scatter in the XLF relation and the error in the measurement,
can be used to determine the XRB contamination probability,
PLMXB . In general, sources brighter than hLLMXB,tot i are
likely to be SMBHs (this is especially true above `X =38.67,
where the XLF becomes very steep). However, because XRBs

5
are Poisson-distributed, their luminosity may differ significantly from hLLMXB,tot i, especially if hNLMXB,tot i is less
than 1. More specifically, for low stellar masses, the mean
and median LX arising from LMXBs can differ significantly,
and there is a higher chance of detecting an XRB for a given
sensitivity threshold than expected from hLLMXB,tot i. To account for this discrepancy, we build normalized probability
distributions of the expected total luminosity in LMXBs for
each galaxy, LLMXB,tot , from which the probability PLMXB
can be derived. For each galaxy containing a nuclear X-ray
detection, we simulate the number of LMXBs detected above
our sensitivity threshold 106 times, by drawing 106 Poisson
deviates (N1,i , N2,i , and N3,i ) from the three intervals of the
re-normalized XLF. We assign a luminosity to each LMXB
(for a total of N1,2,3,i different luminosities) through inverse
transform sampling the normalized XLF, then sum to obtain LLMXB,tot . The distribution of LLMXB,tot then allows
PLMXB to be computed for each galaxy.
By definition, the probability that the nuclear X-ray emission arises from a SMBH is PSMBH =(1-PLMXB ), given in Table 2. Roughly half of all detections (6/11) have a PSMBH
value above 90%. Two galaxies, FCC 21 and FCC 184, have
values below 1% (0.00 and 0.77 % respectively). Notably,
FCC 21, the most massive galaxy in the sample and known
AGN, has its nuclear X-ray signal ruled out from SMBH accretion entirely. This is likely due to the strict criteria we
employ to measure the flux (§2), and highlights the conservative nature of our approach, which allows us to provide robust
lower limits on the AGN fraction.
3.3. Dependence on host stellar mass
The active fraction (for a given sensitivity) is the simplest
metric of black hole activity. Motivated by prior work which
established a functional relationship between the nuclear Xray luminosity and host galaxy stellar mass, we also search
for such a relation within our data; specifically, the presence
of a linear relationship in logarithmic space, of the form:

(logLX − 38.62) = β × (logM? − 9.96) + α

(1)

where variables are centered on their respective median values, and 0.1 dex uncertainties are assumed in both variables. The regression analysis is implemented in IDL with
the Bayesian code LINMIX ERR . PRO (Kelly 2007), which accounts for censored data points and yields reliable results with
as many as 90% of the data points having upper limits (Foord et al. 2017). We adopt the default independent variable
mixture modeling, which makes use of three Gaussians, and
a minimum of 10,000 iterations with Gibbs sampling. The
best-fit parameters are estimated as the median values from
10,000 draws from the posterior distributions. 1σ confidence
intervals are estimated as the 16th and 84th percentiles of the
normalized posterior distribution, after verifying that the posterior distributions appear consistent with a normal distribution. Results from the regression analysis are listed in Table
3.
The regression analysis is first run assuming that all nuclear X-ray sources are SMBHs, adopting the LX values listed
in Table 1 for the FCS sample as dependent variables. The
best-fit linear relation is found to be (logLX − 38.62) =

−0.67+0.26
−0.41 +0.37−0.25 ·(logM? −9.96). The slope β = 0.37
is inconsistent with zero at 1.5σ (first line of Table 3). The
Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.37 for our sample also indicates a significant correlation. However, the existence of a

N OTE. — The dependence of X-ray luminosity upon host stellar mass
is parametrized as (logLX − 38.62) = β × (logM? − 9.96) + α, with intrinsic random scatter (σ0 ) included. The reported parameters are medians
of the posterior distributions, and errors are quoted at the 1σ confidence
level.
a The various samples are defined as follows: meas: measured L valX
ues are employed in the regression analysis, regardless of the estimated
LMXB contamination; lmxb: detections probabilistically treated as an upper limit depending on the estimated PSMBH ; weigh: Mass distributionweighted comparison, where a sub-sample of 29 objects (i.e., same size as
the Fornax sample) has been drawn from the larger sample according to
the weighing functions shown in Figure 3; lmxb-weigh: Mass distributionweighted comparison, with detections being probabilistically treated as an
upper limit within each sub-sample. Note that the lmxb and lmxb-weigh
sub-samples are omitted from the field case because the lack of uniform
HST coverage prevented us from re-assessing the LMXB contamination
probabilities following the procedure outlined in §3.2. For each sample
(i.e., row) n indicates the number of targets under consideration, i.e.:
29 for Fornax; 100 for Virgo; 103 for the field; and 29 again for either Virgo or the field once a mass-corrected comparison to Fornax
is performed; ndet refers to the mean number of X-ray detections after accounting for the different mass distribution and/or LMXB contamination; the value of ndet is computed as the average over all
iterations/sub-samples.

correlation cannot be ruled out at >3 sigma confidence.
In order to account for the LMXB contamination, we rerun LINMIX ERR 1,000 times. Within each iteration, and for
each detected source, we draw a uniform deviate U ∈ (0, 1).
If U exceeds PSMBH , the source is then treated as an upper
limit. The posterior distributions of the 1,000 runs are then
combined, from which the fit parameters and errors are calculated in an equivalent manner as above (Table 3). The resulting slope, β = 0.19 (labeled as lmxb), is consistent with
a zero value within 1σ, so we cannot conclude that the X-ray
luminosity is correlated with host stellar mass. The mild discrepancy between the two treatments (i.e., without and with
LMXB contamination included in the fits) likely results from
the linear correlation of between LMXB luminosity and stellar mass. Nonetheless, the best-fit slopes with and without
correction for LMXB contamination are consistent with each
other because of the small sample size.
4. ENVIRONMENTAL DEPENDENCE OF SMBH ACTIVITY

Here we compare the active fraction, average X-ray luminosity, and X-ray luminosity:host stellar mass correlation between the Fornax sample and two other studies addressing
sub-Eddington X-ray emission from galactic nuclei down to
comparably low sensitivities, i.e. the AMUSE Virgo (Gallo
et al. 2010) and AMUSE-field (Miller et al. 2012a,b) Chandra surveys, including 100 early types within the Virgo cluster, and 103 early types in isolation.
Following Miller et al. (2012b), we first consider here any
possible dependence of the Fornax nuclei X-ray luminosities

NGC 1399. Figure 1 shows LX , residual X-ray luminosity
(i.e, with respect to the best-fitting relation with M? ), and Xray detection fraction as a function of the distance from NGC
1399. No statistically significant trends are observed in any
three of these criteria, and thus we shall now proceed in analysis of the Fornax sample in its entirety.
4.1. Nuclear Activity in the Fornax, Virgo, and field samples

For consistency, LX values for Virgo galaxies are recalculated according to the updated photometry protocol outlined
in § 2. Revised PSMBH values also are updated according to
the LMXB contamination assessment technique described in
§ 3.213 .
Looking at the measurements at face value (labeled as meas
values in Table 4), we derive an active fraction of 29/100 =
29.0%, and 52/103 = 50.5% for Virgo and field respectively.
The face-value Fornax active fraction of 11/29 = 37.9% is intermediate between those of the full Virgo and field samples.
If the active fraction in Fornax were the same as in Virgo,
13 The revised photometry and LMXB assessment technique presented in
this work yield a slightly lower rate of nuclear X-ray detections (29 out of
100, as opposed to 32) and more conservative contamination probabilities
compared to those quoted in the original Virgo analysis (Gallo et al. 2010).
Albeit superior, owing to the small number statistics, the new method presented here does not affect our conclusions from a qualitative perspective, in
the sense that the revised, LMXB contamination-corrected active fraction for
the Virgo sample is consistent, within the errors, with the quoted value from
the original paper.

there would be a 2.5% chance of detecting ≥11/29 galaxies,
whereas if it were the same as the field, the chance for detecting ≤11/29 galaxies would be only 0.5%. The average
detected `X are 38.79, 38.72, and 39.13 for the Fornax, Virgo,
and field sample, respectively; the average error in the measured `X , computed by accounting for the errors on distance
and detected X-ray counts, is ±0.45 dex. So whereas the average `X of Fornax and Virgo are in agreement, the field `X
is marginally greater than Fornax. Considering, however, the
strong dependence of nuclear activity and star formation on
M∗ (Treu et al. 2005), we expect any comparison of active
fraction and LX between the samples of Fornax, Virgo, and
the field to be strongly influenced by the differing M∗ distributions. We address this issue below.
4.1.1. Mass and LMXB-Corrected Comparison

Here we carry out a comparison of the Virgo and field samples to Fornax while accounting for the differing mass distributions. We additionally account for the LMXB contamination on the mass-corrected Virgo sample. For the field sample,
owing to the lack of uniform Hubble Space Telescope coverage, we are unable to revise the LMXB contamination probabilities according to the procedure outlined above. This does
not significantly affect the analysis, however, as it is the comparison between Fornax and Virgo galaxies that is of primary
interest. We further emphasize that the three samples are unbiased with respect to nuclear X-ray properties and capture all
SMBH activity at `X > 38.4.
To control for the different host stellar mass distributions,
we construct mass weighted sub-samples drawn from Virgo
and field (100 and 103 galaxies respectively), which have
a mass distribution consistent with that of our smaller Fornax sample (29 galaxies). This is accomplished through the
use of two weighting functions, defined as the ratio of the
Virgo/field mass distribution to that of Fornax, with the distributions estimated as the sum of multiple Gaussians (see Fig.
2). Converted to probability density functions, the weighting
functions are then used to draw 29 galaxies without replacement. A total of 106 such sub-samples are drawn from the
parent Virgo and field samples. The average mass, detection
luminosity, and number of detections are computed from the

7
drawn sub-samples (Fornax values taken as is), along with
25th, 50th, and 75th percentile values, taken as the closest
discrete value for all three classifications. Results from this
comparison are labeled as weigh values in Table 4.
As in §3.2, we then sampled detections according to their
PSMBH value. We note that the LMXB-corrected parameters
for the Fornax sample are compared heuristically by sampling
the same sample multiple times, whereas for the Virgo sample
106 distinctly drawn sub-samples are each individually sampled once. Results from this comparison are labeled as lmxbweigh values in Table 4.
For the Virgo and field mass-weighted samples, we approximate the probability distribution of the number of detections by centering a Poisson distribution on the mean detection value found. We measure an averaged active fraction
of 40%±11.7% and 74%±15.9% for Virgo and field, respectively (Fornax is 38%±11.4%). The mass-weighted Virgo active fraction is thus consistent with that of Fornax, while the
mass-weighted field sample shows an increased disagreement
with Fornax in active fraction, compared to the non-weighted
full field sample. When further correcting for LMXB contamination, the Virgo active fraction is 36.6% ± 11.2%, whereas
Fornax’s active fraction is 26.6% ± 9.6%. These values remain in tentative agreement, although the data suggest that
the Fornax LMXB contamination-corrected active fraction is
smaller: given an average of 7.8 detections in 29 observations,
the probability of detecting > 10 is 9.6%, and of detecting
> 11 is 6.7%.
The average detection luminosity, `X,ndet , for the weighted
Virgo samples is 38.73, less than that of Fornax at 38.79, as
well as that of the weighted field samples at 38.98. Considering that the average error in `X of Fornax is ±0.45, however,
the three samples are in agreement. These average luminosities may be misleading if they tend to come from galaxies
with very different masses; however, in a randomly pulled
Virgo mass-weighted sub-sample, 9 detections are recorded
between 1010 − 1011 M∗ , all with luminosities between 38.4
and 38.8. In the Fornax sample, four detections are found in
the same mass bin, two of which have luminosities above 39,
so the apparently larger luminosities of the Fornax detections
is not due to a large difference in the masses of galaxies containing detections. For the LMXB contamination-corrected,
mass-weighted Virgo sub-samples, the mean `X,ndet is 38.77,
equivalent to that of the LMXB-corrected Fornax sample at
38.77. There is no evidence for any statistically significant
difference between the detection luminosities between Fornax
and Virgo.
When constructing mass-weighted Virgo samples to match
the Fornax mass distribution, we conclude that no statistically significant difference in either the active fraction or average nuclear X-ray luminosity between the two clusters is
found. This is true regardless of whether or not we account for
LMXB contamination, although there is a suggestion that the
active fraction in Fornax may be slightly lower than in Virgo
galaxies with the same mass. Further, as expected, the active
fraction and average luminosity of Fornax are systematically
lower than those of the field sample for both face-value and
mass-weighted comparisons, though the difference is more
pronounced in active fraction, whereas the difference in luminosity remains within the error. The pronounced change of
the Fornax active fraction after accounting for LMXB contamination, relative to Virgo, suggests a greater amount of
LMXB contamination within the Fornax sample (likely due
to the larger fraction of massive galaxies with low nuclear

X-ray luminosities in this sample). Assuming the LMXBcorrected and LMXB-corrected plus mass-weighted comparisons between Fornax/Virgo reflect more accurately the true
active fraction within the samples, the data suggest the active
fraction of Fornax to be lower.
4.2. LX :M? correlation in Fornax, Virgo, field
Next, we compare the best-fit LX :M? relationship for Fornax to that in the Virgo and field samples. Similarly to what
we did for the active fraction and mean luminosity assessment, we first run the regression analysis on the measured
(i.e., non LMXB-contamination-corrected) LX values for the
Virgo and the field galaxies. This is then compared with the
results from LMXB-corrected analysis (labeled as lmxb in
Table 3) , where, for the Virgo sample, LINMIX ERR is run
5,000 times, probabilistically varying each detection as a detection/limit based on their respective PSMBH probabilities.
Best-fitting values of the intercept, slope and intrinsic scatter
are listed in Table 3 and labeled as meas and lmxb sample,
respectively, for the face-value and contamination-corrected
samples (Table 3).

a difference in the incidence and intensity of such activities,
which can be interpreted as evidence of environmental effects
on SMBH fueling and accretion. The Fornax Cluster, being
significantly denser and possessing an intra-cluster temperature roughly twice that of Virgo, offers the opportunity to further examine local low-level SMBH activity and the impact of
different environmental effects. From the ACS FCS, we target
17 Fornax galaxies with the Chandra X-ray Telescope, which
we then combine with 12 existing archival observations, all
of which are unbiased with respect to nuclear properties and
capture all SMBH activity at `X > 38.4. The results from this

The Fornax slope, β = 0.37−0.25

slope within 1 σ, and differs from the field slope at 1.2 σ. The
LMXB-corrected Fornax slope, β = 0.19+0.55
−0.50 , is similarly
consistent with Virgo’s within 1σ.
To control for the different mass distributions, we re-run
LINMIX ERR on 500 (reduced from the 106 samples used previously for feasibility) of the Fornax-matched Virgo and field
sub-samples, and combine the posterior distributions of each
sub-sample, from which we pull the median values for the
intercept, slope and intrinsic scatter. Lastly, we account for
LMXB contamination to the mass-weighted samples by probabilistically varying, within each drawn sub-sample, each LX
10 times according to their PSMBH probabilities, for a total of
5,000 runs. The results from this final comparison are listed
in Table 3 and labeled as weigh and lmxb-weigh, respectively,
and are shown in Figure 3.
The mass-weighted Virgo best-fit slope, β = 0.71+0.45

is consistent, within the errors, with the face-value slope.
Similarly, the slope for mass-weighted plus LMXB-corrected
Virgo sample increases slightly to β = 0.73+0.59
−0.40 , though
again, it is consistent, within the errors, with the face-value
slope. The face-value Fornax slope differs from the massweighted Virgo slope at 1.0 σ, and from the mass-weighted,
contamination-corrected slope at the 1.1 σ level. The best-fit
relations for Fornax and Virgo are shown in Figure 3 (the field
sample is omitted from this comparison as the lack of uniform
HST coverage prevented us from re-assessing the LMXB contamination following our new methodology, outlined in §3.2).

5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Previous studies of local low-level SMBH activity, through
the AMUSE-Virgo and AMUSE field surveys, demonstrate

1. A nuclear X-ray point source consistent with the optical center of the galaxy is found in 11 out of 29 of
the Fornax galaxies. Taking into consideration the contained stellar mass within the nuclear aperture of each
nuclear X-ray detection as well as their respective measured luminosity, we quantify the estimated likelihood
of each detection originating from SMBH powered accretion. We then compute a weighted active fraction of
26.6% ± 9.6%.
2. We employ a Bayesian regression analysis to search for
a linear relationship between the nuclear X-ray luminosity and host galaxy stellar mass, and find a best+0.33
fit relation (`X −38.62) = −0.67+0.26
−0.41 + 0.37−0.25 ·
(logM? − 9.96). The large uncertainties prevent us
from placing strong constraints on the LX :M? relation. When accounting for LMXB contamination for
each detection in the analysis, a lower intercept and
much flatter slope are returned (β = 0.19+0.55
−0.50 ), due to
the high chance of contamination for the higher mass
galaxies in the sample.
3. We compare the incidence and intensity of nuclear activity, measured through their average `X and active
fraction, between Fornax, Virgo and field galaxies. After correcting for the different mass distributions, the
measured Fornax active fraction is found to be less than
the field fraction, at > 3σ. These findings are consistent with the conclusions of Miller et al. (2012a), in that
lower activity is found in cluster galaxies. This is consistent with a scenario where the funneling of gas to the
nuclear regions has been inhibited more effectively in
a cluster environment, arguably via ram pressure stripping or galaxy-galaxy deceleration induced by dynamical friction (see also Baldassare et al. 2014).
4. After accounting for the different mass distributions,
the average `X and active fraction in Fornax and Virgo
are consistent within the errors, although the data suggest that, after LMXB contamination corrections, the
Fornax active fraction may be smaller than Virgo’s. If
significant, this would tentatively suggest that dynamical friction (expected to be a factor ∼10 higher in Fornax than in Virgo), may play a more important role in
gas removal compared to ram-pressure stripping.
