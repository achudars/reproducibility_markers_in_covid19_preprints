TOPLOGICAL PRESSURE FOR CONSERVATIVE C 1 -DIFFEOMORPHISMS
WITH NO DOMINATED SPLITTING
XUEMING HUI
Abstract. We prove three formulas for computing topological pressure of C 1 -generic conservative diffeomorphism and show the continuity of topological pressure with respect to these diffeomorphisms. We prove for these generic diffeomorphisms that there is no equilibrium states with
positive measure theoretic entropy. In particular, for hyperbolic potentials, there is no equilibrium
states.
For C 1 generic conservative diffeomorphism on compact surfaces with no dominated splitting

and φm (x) := − m
log kDx f m k, m ∈ N, we show that there exist equilibrium states with zero
entropy and there exists a transition point t0 for the family {tφm (x)}t≥0 , such that there is no
equilibrium states for t ∈ [0, t0 ) and there is an equilibrium state for t ∈ [t0 , +∞).

Keywords. Topological pressure; measure theoretic entropy; dominated splitting; Lyapunov exponent; Equilibrium states; Phase transition.
1. Introduction
Topological pressure is a natural generalization of toplogical entropy.
The variational principle
R
for topological pressure says that P (f, φ) = supµ∈P(f ) {hµ (f ) + φ dµ}. Here f is a continuous
map from a compact metric space X to itself, φ is a continuous function from X to R and is
refered to as a potential function or observable, and P(f ) is the set of invariant Borel probability
measures of f , P (f, φ) denotes
the topological pressure of (f, φ). If there exists a ν ∈ P(f ) such
R
that P (f, φ) = hν (f ) + φ dν, then ν is called an equilibrium state for (f, φ). In the special case
φ ≡ 0, P (f, 0) = htop (f ) and an equilibrium state is called a measure of maximal entropy for f .
Here we briefly introduce some known results for equilibrium states for smooth dynamical system.
First, if f is C ∞ , there exists an equlibrium state. The idea is that in this situation the entropy map
µ 7→ hµ (f ) is upper semi-continuous [24] and therefore by weak*-compactness of the space of f invariant Borel probability measures, there is an equilibrium state. More generally, expansivity will
gurantee that the entropy map is upper semi-conituous and thus implies the existence of equilibrium
states. In particular, hyperbolic diffeomorphisms are expansive. For an Axiom A diffeomorphism,
there are many important results, see [9]. For example, for a Hölder continuous potential function,
there are at most finitely many ergodic equlibrium states, and the problem of the existence of a
unique equilibrium state is solved by finding a Markov partition. Then using results of David Ruelle
on the Gibbs measure on the subshift of finite type [30], the result for Axiom A diffeomorphisms
follows.

Partially hyperbolic systems are not expansive in general, but when the center direction is onedimensional, we still have the existence of equilibrium states. This is because they are entropy
expansive [6][13], and entropy expansiveness is enough to gurantee the existence of equilibriums
states. When the center direction is more than one dimensional, counter examples are constructed
by Buzzi and Fisher [12]. There are several examples of the equilibrium states of partially hyperbolic
systems, one of the first is known as “ partially hyperbolic horseshoes ”, the existence of equlibrium states was proved by Leplaideur, Oliveira and Rios [21]; the uniqueness results for potentials
constant on the center-stable direction were given by Arbieto and Prudente [2]; several examples
of phase transitions were given by Dı́az, Gelfert, and Rams [17][16][15]. For certain partially hyperbolic horseshoes, the uniqueness of equilibrium states for Hölder potentials with small variation
was proved by Rios and Siqueira [28], and the statistical properties of these equilibrium states were
studied by Ramos and Siqueira [26]. A related class of partially hyperbolic skew-products with
non-uniformly expanding base and uniformly contracting fiber was studied by Ramos and Viana
[27]. Some results on the uniqueness of equilibrium states for partially hyperbolic DA systems on
T3 were proved Crisostomo and Tahzibi [14].
In this paper, we focus on studying the topological pressure and equilibrium states for C 1 -generic
conservative diffeomorphism with no dominated splitting. Using a symbolic coding to determine
equilibrium states does not work in this case, since by a result of Buzzi, Croviser and Fisher [11],
there is no symbolic extention for these diffeomorphisms. Instead, we will prove that for these
diffeomorphisms, there is no equlibrium states with positive measure theoretic entropy for any
continuous potential fucntion. This is a generalization of results in [11], where it is shown that
there is no measure with maximal entropy for these diffeomorphism.
Before stating our main results, we define some notations and concepts. Let M be a d0 dimensional compact orientable Riemannian manifold and Diff 1ω (M ) be the set of diffeomorphisms preserving ω where ω is either a volume form or a symplecetic form. Throughout this paper, we denote the
(f, p) :=
period of p by T (p). Let λ1 (f, p) ≤ λ2 (f, p) ≤ ... ≤ λd0 (f, p) be eigenvalues of Dp f T (p) , λ+
Pd0 +
Pd0 i −

max(λi (f, p), 0), λi (f, p) := max(−λi (f, p), 0) and ∆(f, p) := min( i=1 λi (f, p), i=1 λi (f, p)).
P 0 +
P 0 −
In particular, for conservative system, ∆(f, p) = di=1
λi (f, p) = di=1
λi (f, p).
We say that an invariant compact set Λ has an dominated splitting if there exists a non-trivial
decomposition T M |Λ = E ⊕ F of the tangent bundle of M above Λ in two invariant continuous
subbundles, C > 0 and 0 < λ < 1, such that for all x ∈ Λ, all n ≥ N and all unit vectors u ∈ E(x)
and v ∈ F (x) we have,
kDf n uk ≤ Cλn kDf n vk, ∀n ≥ 1.
Firstly, we have an abstract result, Theorem 3.1, about the lower bound for topological pressure
for a given system (f, φ), where f is a diffeomorphism on a compact Riemannian manifold satisfying
certain properties and φ : M 7→ R is continuous. This will give us three formulas for topological
pressure for a generic diffeomorphism f ∈ Eω (M ), where Eω (M ) denotes the interior of the set of all
diffeomorphisms in Diff 1ω (M ) that do not have a dominated splitting on the entire manifold. This
is always nonempty1.
1One can find a diffeomorphism such that for each 1 ≤ i < d there exists a periodic point p with period m such
0
that Dp f m has d0 simple eigenvalues λ1 , . . . , λd0 such that |λk | < |λk+1 | for each k 6= i and such that λi , λi+1 are
non-real conjugated complex numbers. Then if f has a dominated splitting on the entire manifold, by continuity of
the splitting, we have the dimensions of the finest splitting will be constant which contradicts our construction.

As in [11], we can relate topological pressure to Lyapunov exponents of periodic orbit and the
Birkhoff average of potential function on the periodic orbit. And then by Theorem 3.1, we can
relate that to the topological pressure of horseshoe. More specifically, we have the following.
Theorem 1.1. There exists a residual subset G of Eω (M ) such that for any f ∈ G and any
continuous function φ : M 7→ R we have
P (f, φ) =

sup {∆(f, p) +

By the structual stability of horseshoe, we have the upper semi-continuity of P (f, φ) with respect
to f . And by the fact that the set of continuity points of a semi-continuous function on a Baire
space always contains a residual subset, we have the following.
Theorem 1.2. There is a residual subset G in Eω (M ) such that for any fixed φ ∈ C 0 (M, R), each
f ∈ G is a continuity point of the map f :7→ P (f, φ).
For any C 1 -diffeomorphism f of a compact, d0 dimensional, Riemannian manifold M and for
each integer 1 ≤ k ≤ d0 , we define the following quantity,
σk (f, φ) := lim

sup

n→∞ E∈Grass (T M)

(log | Jac(f n , E)| + Sn φ(πk (E))) .

here πk (E) is the basepoint of E and Sn (φ) is the Birkhoff sum of φ.
Then we have the following formula for topological pressure of generic diffeomorphism in Eω (M ).
Theorem 1.3. There exists a residual subset G of Eω (M ) such that for any f ∈ G and any
φ ∈ C 0 (M, R) we have
P (f, φ) = max σk (f, φ).
1≤k≤d0

In [11], Buzzi, Crovisier and Fisher prove that for a generic diffeomorphism in Eω (M ), there
is no measure with maximal entropy. Similarly, we prove that for these diffeomorphism and any
continuous potential function, there is no equilibrium states with positive measure theoretic entropy.
Theorem 1.4. There exists a residual subset G of Eω (M ) such that for any f ∈ G and any
φ ∈ C 0 (M, R) we have, any equilibrium state of (f, φ) has zero measure theoretic entropy.
It is clear that this is only a generic result. We can easily find diffeomorphisms with positive
topological entropy and no dominated splitting on the entire manifold which has a unique equilibrium state with positive measure theoretic entropy. This can be seen by embedding the Smale
horseshoe on any surfaces using a bump function so that the diffeomorphism is the identity outside
a neighborhood of the horseshoe. Then this diffeomorphism has no dominated splitting on the
entire manifold. See [32] for details of the construction of Smale’s horseshoe. By classical results of
R. Bowen [8][7], for this diffeomorphism and any Hölder continuous potential function, there exist
a unique equlibrium state with positive measure theoretic entropy.
We know that a K-automorphism must have positive measure theoretic entropy [29], therefore
by Theorem 1.4, we have:
Corollary 1.5. Tthere exists a residual subset G of Eω (M ) such that for any f ∈ G and any
φ ∈ C 0 (M, R) we have, if µ is an equilibrium state, then (f, µ) is not a K-automorphism.

Note that it is always true that

φ dµ ≤ P (f, φ).

Following [19], the potential φ will be called
a hyperbolic potential for f if we have strict inequality
R
in the above inequality. By supµ∈Perg (f ) φ dµ ≤ sup φ and inf φ + htop (f ) ≤ P (f, φ), the following
corollary is immeadiate.

Corollary 1.6. There exists a residual subset G of Eω (M ) such that for any f ∈ G and any
φ ∈ C 0 (M, R) we have, there is no Equilibrium states. In particular, if sup φ − inf φ < htop (f ),
then φ is a hyperbolic potential function.

Based on the above general results for a compact Riemannian manifold of arbitrary dimension,
we have some results for conservative diffeomorphisms of compact surfaces. We first recall some
results for conservative diffeomorphisms on compact surfaces.
Let p be a periodic point of period m for a conservative diffeomorphism f on the compact surface
M . We will call p an elliptic periodic point if the linear operator Dp f m : Tp M 7→ Tp M has only
eigenvalues of norm 1 but not equal to 1. In the conservative setting, this means that it has two
conjugate complex eigenvalues on the unit circle. By a result of S. Newhouse in [23], we know that
for a generic diffeomorphism in Eω (M ), the set of all elliptic periodic orbits are dense in M and
each elliptic orbit can be approximated by hyperbolic periodic orbits. This shows that there are
many points with only zero Lyapunov exponents. A result by J. Bochi [4] shows that for C 1 generic
conservative diffeomorphismon on surfaces, either the diffeomorphism is Anosov or the set of points
with only zero Lyapunov exponents has full Lebesgue measure.This result was announced by R.
Mañé around 1980 without a published proof. We want to know if there is an ergodic equilibrium
state with only zero Lyapunov exponents.
By Theorem 1.4, for a generic diffeomorphism in Eω (M ) with a hyperbolic potential function,
there is no equilibrium states. It should not be surprising that for some specific potential functions,
there exist equilibrium states. That is for these diffeomorphism, non-hyperbolic potential functions
1
log kDx f m k, m ∈ N, we have that for f in a residual subset
exist. For example, for φm (x) := − m
of Eω (M ), we can find m depending on f , such that there exists equilibrium states for (f, φm ). We
also prove a result on the phase transition of the family of potential function tφm for t ≥ 0. More
details on the results on compact surefaces can be found in Section 6.
Outline. This paper is outlined as follow. In Section 2, we give the preliminaries for the paper. Section 3 is devoted to a result on a non-trivial lower bound of the topological pressure of
a horseshoe created by a C 1 -perturbation near a periodic orbit with weak domination and large
period. In Section 4, we prove three formulas for topological pressure for C 1 -generic conservative
diffeomorphism with no dominated splitting. In particular, Theorem 1.1 is proved in subsection
4.1, Theorem 1.2 is proved in subsection 4.2 and Theorem 1.3 is given in subsection 4.3. In Section
5, we give the proof of non-exisitence of equilibrium states with positive entropy for these diffeomorphisms (Theorem 1.4). It should be mentioned that many results in section 4 and section 5 are
generalizations of parallel reulsts in [11]. Finally, the last section, Section 6 contains some results
for surface diffeomorphisms.

2. Preliminaries
In this section ,we recall some basic notations, concepts and theorems that will be used. Specifically, we review weak forms of hyperbolicity, topological pressure and perturbation tools for C 1
dynamics.
Let M be a compact orientable connected boundaryless Riemannian manifold with dimension d0 ,
f be a C 1 diffeomorphism and Λ be a compact f -invariant subset of M . Λ is said to be a hyperbolic
set for f , if there is a f -invariant splitting T M |Λ = E ⊕ F and constants C > 0, 0 < λ < 1 such
that the following hold,
kDx f n |E k ≤ Cλn ,
kDx f −n |F k ≤ Cλn
for any non-negative integer n and any x ∈ Λ.
If Λ is a hyperbolic set for a C 1 diffeomorphism f , and x ∈ Λ, the stable manifold of x is
s
W (x) = {y ∈ M : d(f n x, f n y) → 0, n → +∞}. Similarly, we can define the unstable manifold of
x as W u (x) = {y ∈ M : d(f n x, f n y) → 0, n → −∞}.
set Λ is locally maximal if there is an open neighborhood U of Λ such that Λ =
T A hyperbolic
n
n∈Z f (U ). f is called transitive on an invariant set Λ if there is a point x in Λ such that the
closure of its orbit is Λ. A set K is called a horseshoe for a diffeomorphism f if the following hold,
• K is a locally maximal hyperbolic set;
• K is homeomorphic to the Cantor set; and
• f is transitive on K.
The concept of a dominated splitting is a generalization of hyperbolicity.
Definition 2.1. Let N ≥ 1 be a natural number, we say that an invariant compact set Λ has an
N-dominated splitting if there exists a non-trivial invariant decomposition T M |Λ = E ⊕ F such
that for all x ∈ Λ, all n ≥ N and all unit vectors u ∈ E(x) and v ∈ F (x) we have,
kDf n uk ≤ kDf n vk/2.
It says that one subbundle in the splitting is dominated by another one, but we may not have
the uniform contraction and expansion in each subbundle. This definition of dominated splitting is
equivalent to the definition given in the introduction section. It will be useful when we apply some
perturbation techniques. In particular, we will use this definition in Theorem 3.1.
If p is a periodic point for f , we denote by T (p) the period of p and by O(p) its orbit. It is a
saddle if the orbit O(p) is hyperbolic and both E and F are nontrivial.
Definition 2.2. Let T, N be two natural numbers, we say that a periodic point p is T, N-weak if
T (p) ≥ T and O(p) has no N -dominated splitting.
Definition 2.3. A diffeormorphism f with no dominated splitting on a compact manifold M is
one such that the whole manifold M does not have a dominated splitting.
We say that two hyperbolic periodic orbits O1 , O2 are homoclinically related if W s (O1 ) intersects
W (O2 ) transversely, and W u (O1 ) intersects W s (O2 ) transversely. The homoclinic class H(p) of
a hyperbolic periodic point p is the closure of the set of all hyperbolic periodic orbits that are
homoclinically related to O(p).

If ω is a volume or a symplectic form on M , one denotes by Diff1ω (M ) the subspace of diffeomorphisms which preserve ω. We say that a diffeomorphism is conservative if it is in Diff1ω (M ) for a
volume or symplecetic form ω.
For each natural number n, we define a metric dn on a compact metric space (X, d).
dn (x, y) :=

max d(f i (x), f i (y)).

0≤i≤n−1

An (n, ǫ)-Bowen ball Bf (x, n, ǫ) is a open ball with radius
ǫ in dn distance centered at some point
S
x ∈ X. A set E is said to be (n, ǫ)-spanning if X ⊂ x∈E Bf (x, n, ǫ).
Topological pressure is an analog of topological entropy. Let
Pf : X 7→ X be continuous and φ be
the potential function. Denote by Qn (f, φ, ǫ) the infimum of x∈F exp(Sn φ)(x) over all the (n, ǫ)
spanning sets F for X, where Sn φ(x) denote the Birkhorff sum of f at x. Then the following limit
exist and is called the topological pressure of the system (f, φ).

P (f, φ) := lim+ lim sup log Qn (f, φ, ǫ)
n
ǫ→0
n→∞
We denote by P(f ) the set of all Borel probability measures that f preserves, and Perg (f ) the
set of those which are ergodic.
There is a variational principle
for topological pressure just
R like that of entropy. It says that
R
P (f, φ) = supµ∈P(f ) {hµ (f ) + φ dµ} = supµ∈Perg {hµ (f ) + φ dµ}. For a proof of Variational
Principle, see [33].
Let f ∈ Diff 1ω (M ) and µ ∈ P(f ). Then by Oseledet’s theorem, there is a µ full measure set on
which we have a decomposition Tx M = E1 (x) ⊕ · · · Ek(x) (x) such that for any non-zero v ∈ Ei (x)
log kDx f n vk
= λi (x).

where λ1 (x) ≤ λ2 (x) ≤ · · · ≤ λd0 (x), λi (x) is called a Lyapunov exponent of x. If µ is an ergodic
measure then λi is constant almost everywhere for each i.

Perturbative tools.
In order to prove the generic properties, we will need to know how to perturb a diffeomorphism
in C 1 -topology. In this paper, the main perturbative tools we will use are Franks’ Lemma for both
conservative and non-conservative C 1 -diffeomorphism and Mañé’s ergodic closing lemma.
Definition 2.4. Let ∇ be the Levi-Civita connection, u ∈ Tx M and v ∈ Ty M ,
d(u, v) := inf ku − Γγ vk + Length(γ),
γ

1

where γ is a C -curve connecting x and y and Γγ is the parallel transport along γ.
Definition 2.5. The C 1 -topology on the space Diff 1ω (M ) is the topology induced by the following
metric

dC 1 (f, g) = sup max d(Df (v), Dg(v)), d(Df −1 (v), Dg −1 (v)) .
v∈T 1 M

for any f, g in

Diff 1ω (M )

Let f, g ∈ Diff 1ω (M ), g is said to be an ǫ-perturbation of f if dC 1 (g, f ) < ǫ. A property is said to
hold robustly if it holds under ǫ-perturbations for some ǫ > 0.

TOPLOGICAL PRESSURE FOR CONSERVATIVE C 1 -DIFFEOMORPHISMS WITH NO DOMINATED SPLITTING7

Definition 2.6. Let f ∈ Diff 1ω (M ), X ⊂ M be a finite set, V be a neighborhood of X, and ǫ > 0.
A diffeomorphism g ∈ Diff 1ω (M ) is an (ǫ, V, X)-perturbation of f in Diff 1ω (M ) if dC 1 (f, g) < ǫ and
g(x) = f (x) for all x outside of V \ X.
We will use the following strengthening of the classical Franks’ lemma[18].
Theorem 2.7 (Franks’ lemma with linearization [10]). Let f ∈ Diff 1ω (M ), ǫ > 0 small, X ⊂ M be
a finite set and χ : V → Rd0 be a chart with X ⊂ V . For x ∈ X, if Ax : Tx M → Tf (x) M be a linear
map such that
−1
max(kAx − Df (x)k, kA−1
(x)k) < ǫ/2.
x − Df

Then there exists an (ǫ, V, X)-perturbation g of f in Diff 1ω (M ) such that for each x ∈ X the map
χ ◦ g ◦ χ−1 is linear in a neighborhood of χ(x) and Dg(x) = Ax .
This strengthening of Franks’ Lemma allow us to perturb a diffeomorphism locally. This will be
convenient for our construction.
By Riesz Representation Theorem for Borel measures, the space of complex Borel measures on
M can be identified to the dual space of the space of continuous function on M , this gives a natural
topology on the space of complex Borel measures on M .
Definition 2.8. For a sequence of complex Borel measures µn , and a fixed complex Borel measure
µ, we say that µn converge to µ in vague topology if the following holds
Z
Z
φ dµn → φ dµ, ∀φ ∈ C 0 (M )
where C 0 (M ) is the space of continuous function on M .
One can also show that this topology is metrizable, see [33].
Mañé’s ergodic closing lemma [22] says that for any C 1 -diffeomorphism f and any ergodic measure of it, there exists a small C 1 -perturbation g of f having a periodic orbit O that is close to µ in
the vague topology. In [1, Proposition 6.1], the following stonger version of ergodic closing lemma
is proved and the proofs also work in conservative case.
Theorem 2.9 (Ergodic closing lemma). For any C 1 -diffeomorphism f in Diff 1ω (M ) and any µ
in Perg (f ), there is a C 1 -perturbation g of f in Diff 1ω (M ) having a periodic orbit O close to µ in
the vague topology and Lyapunov exponents of O are close to that of µ for f . Moreover f and g
coincide outside a small neighborhood of the support of µ.
The corollary below for C 1 -generic (conservative or dissipative) diffeomorphism is immediate.
Corollary 2.10. For any generic diffeomorphism f in Diff 1ω (M ), and any µ in Perg (f ), there is
a sequence of periodic orbits (On ) which converges to µ in the vauge topology and whose Lyapunov
exponents converge to those of µ.
This will give the following convenient proposition to spread a periodic orbit in a horseshoe
without changing the Lyapunov exponents too much.
Proposition 2.11. [1, Theorem 3.10] For any generic diffeomorphism f in Diff 1ω (M ), any horseshoe K, any periodic orbit O ⊂ K and any ǫ > 0, there is a periodic orbit O′ ⊂ K that is ǫ-close to
K in the Hausdorff distance and the set of Lyapunov exponent of O′ is ǫ-close to that of O.

3. A non-trivial lower bound for Topological pressure
As in [11], we create a horseshoe from a hyperbolic periodic point with large period and weak
domination after a local C 1 perturbation. The topological pressure of the horseshoe after the
perturbation will be bounded by the sum of positive Lyapunov exponents (or the same for the
inverse of the diffeomorphism, whichever is smaller) plus the arithmetic average of the value of φ
on the orbit of the periodic point with an arbitrarily small error.
Theorem 3.1. Given any integer d0 ≥ 2 and numbers C > 0 and ǫ > 0, there exist integers
N, T ≥ 1 with the following property. For any closed d0 -dimensional Riemannian manifold M ,
any diffeomorphism f ∈ Diff 1ω (M ) with Lip(f ), Lip(f −1 ) ≤ C, any φ : M 7→ R continuous, any
T, N -weak periodic point p with period T (p) and any constant δ > 0, there exists ρ > 0 and an
ST (p)−1
(ǫ, V, O(p))-perturbation g of f in Diff 1ω (M ), where V := i=0
B(f i (p), ρ) and B(f i (p), ρ) is the
i
open ball centered at f (p) with radius ρ > 0, such that
• for any x in O(p), Dx f = Dx g and
• g contains a horseshoe K ⊂ V such that
P (g|K , φ|K ) ≥ ∆(g, p) +

1
T (p)

PT (p)−1
i=0

φ(g i (p)) − δ.

Remark 3.2. The perturbation used in this theorem is the same as in the main theorem of [11].
The idea is we can create a horseshoe in V for arbitrary small ρ > 0. This will make the variation
of φ (that is sup φ − inf φ) near each point of the periodic orbit as small as we want. Therefore, the
potential function φ will be almost locally constant, and we can use the main theorem of [11] to get
the lower bound.
Proof. Take ρ to be small enough such that B(f i (p), ρ) ∩ B(f j (p), ρ) = ∅ for any i 6= j and
supx,y∈B(f i (p),ρ) |φ(x) − φ(y)| < δ for each i. We will use a parallel result for topological entropy
in [11, Theorem 4.1]. In [11], it is shown that there exists an (ǫ, V, O(p))-perturbation g satisfying
item 1 of our theorem and a horseshoe K ⊂ V of g such that htop (g|K ) ≥ ∆(g, p). We will prove
that this g works for our theorem.

4. Formulas for topological pressure
In this section, we prove three formulas for topological pressure. This enable us to represent
topological pressure using some information about periodic orbits, horseshoes and Lyapunov exponents. With these formulas, we will be able to prove the non-existence of equilibrium states with
positive entropy for C 1 -generic conservative diffeomorphism.
4.1. Periodic orbits and horseshoes.
By Ruelle’s inequality [31], we have for any ergodic measure µ that
hµ (f ) ≤

for a periodic orbit p.
Lemma 4.2. For any fixed continuous function φ : M 7→ R, the map defined by f 7→ ∆φ (f ) :=
supp∈Per(f ) ∆φ (f, p) from Diff 1ω (M ) to R has a dense Gδ set of continuity points.
Proof. For each α ∈ Q, let Uα+ (resp. Uα− ) be the set of diffeomorphisms f such that for any g
sufficiently C 1 close to f , we have ∆φ (g) > a (resp. ∆φ (g) < a).
For any f with ∆φ (f ) ≥ α, assume that p is a periodic point of f such that ∆φ (f, p) is arbitrarily
close to ∆φ (f ). By Franks’ Lemma (conservative version), we can make a perturbation h of f around
the orbit of p to make ∆φ (h, p) > α. We can also make p a hyperbolic periodic point for h. The
structual stability of hyperbolic periodic orbits and the C 1 -smoothness of h implies that h is in Uα+ .
Therefore, f is in Uα+ .
For those f such that ∆φ (f ) < α and f is not in Uα− , we can find a sequence of diffeomorphisms
hn ∈ Eω (M ) converging to f such that ∆φ (hn ) ≥ α by the definition of Uα− . We know that hn ∈ Uα+ .
Hence, f = limn→∞ hn ∈ Uα+ . This proves that for any f ∈ Diff 1ω (M ), f ∈ Uα+ ∪ Uα− .
T
So Uα := Uα+ ∪ Uα− is open and dense in Eω (M ). If f ∈ α∈Q Uα , α1 , α2 ∈ Q, such that
α1 < ∆φ (f ) < α2 , then we must have f ∈ Uα+1 ∩ Uα−2 . Hence, for any g sufficiently C 1 close to f ,
we have
T α1 < ∆φ (g) < α2 . This proves that f is a continuity point for ∆φ (f ). Hence the generic
set α∈Q Uα is the set of continuity points of ∆φ (f ).

Lemma 4.3. For any continuous function φ : M 7→ R, there exists a residual subset G of Eω (M )
such that for any f ∈ G we have
∆φ (f ) ≤

sup

P (f |K , φ|K )

Horseshoe K

Proof. Let G1 be the set of continuity points of ∆φ over Eω (M ).
Let G2 be the set of f that has a hyperbolic periodic orbit whose homoclinic class H(O) is the
whole manifold M . From [5][3] this set contains a generic subset of Eω (M ).
f ∈ G3 if for any hyperbolic periodic orbit O and any ǫ, there exists a periodic orbit O′ which is
ǫ-dense in H(O) and whose collection of Lyapunov exponents is ǫ-close to the Lyapunov exponents
of O. Hyperbolic periodic points are dense in H(O) by definition. We can then pick finitely many
hyperbolic periodic points that are ǫ-dense in H(O). Then there is a horseshoe containing O that
is ǫ-dense in H(O). By Proposition 2.11 we know that G3 is dense in G2 .
Let f ∈ G1 ∩ G2 ∩ G3 ∩ Eω (M ). This is a dense subset in Eω (M ). We then fix a neighborhood U
of f , N, T as given by the main theorem. Let ǫ > 0 be small, we can find a periodic orbit O such
that ∆φ (f, O) > ∆φ (f ) − ǫ/4. Since f ∈ G2 ∩ G3 , we can replace O by a periodic orbit O(p) which
is ǫ-dense in H(O) = M . This implies that p has a large period, in particular we can chose p such
that its period is larger than T . Since f ∈ Eω (M ), for any N and invariant splitting T M = E ⊕ F ,
there are x ∈ M, n ≥ N, η > 21 , such that for some unit vectors u ∈ E(x), v ∈ F (x), we have the
following,
kDx f n uk > ηkDx f n vk

12

Since O(p) is ǫ-dense in H(O) = M , there is an iteration of p, say f m (p) which is ǫ-close to x. For
any fixed C ∈ (0, 1), we can make ǫ small enough, such that

This proves that p is a T, N -weak periodic point. By Theorem 3.1, we can find g in U having a
horseshoe K whose topological pressure is greater than ∆φ (f, O(p)) − ǫ/4 > ∆φ (f ) − ǫ/2.
By structual stability of horseshoe, this property is open. Since f ∈ G1 , we have a non-empty
open set of diffeomorphisms h having a horseshoe K such that
S P (h|K , φ|K ) ≥ ∆φ (f ) − ǫ/2 >
∆φ (g) − ǫ/2 − ǫ/2 = ∆φ (g) − ǫ. Denote this set by Vf,ǫ . Then f ∈G1 ∩G2 ∩G3 ∩Eω (M) Vf,ǫ is open and
dense in Eω (M ). Then

4.1 and Lemma 4.3 will immediately implies that for a given φ, there is a residual subset Gφ of

C 0 (M, R), the space of real valued continuous functions on M , is separable (because M is compact),
there is a countable, dense subset {ϕ1 , ϕ2 , . . . , ϕn , . . . } of C 0 (M, R). Let Gn be the residual
subset of Eω (M ) on which equation (1) holds for ϕn , then G = ∩∞
n=1 Gn is a residual subset of
Eω (M ) on which equation (1) holds for all ϕn . Since P (f, φ), ∆φ (f ) and supK P (f |K , φ|K ) are all
continuous with respect to φ and {ϕ1 , ϕ2 , . . . , ϕn , . . . } is dense in C 0 (M, R), for any f in G and
any φ ∈ C 0 (M, R), equation (1) holds. This proves Theorem 1.1.

4.2. Continuity of topological pressure.
Proof of Theorem 1.2. By Theorem 1.1, there is a residual subset G of Eω (M ) such that for any
f ∈ G and any φ in C 0 (M, R), P (f, φ) = supK P (f |K , φ|K ) = ∆φ (f ). Here K is a horseshoe of f .
Let {ϕ1 , ϕ2 , . . . , ϕn , . . . } be dense in C 0 (M, R). By Lemma 4.2, there is a sequence of residual
subsets {Gn }∞
n=1 of Eω (M ) such that each f ∈ Gn is a continuity point of the map g 7→ ∆ϕn (g).

Then each f ∈ G ′ = ∩∞

residual subset of Eω (M ). For any f ∈ G ′ and any φ ∈ C 0 (M, R), take a sequence {fn } ⊂ Diff 1ω (M )
such that fn → f . For any ǫ > 0, let ϕm be ǫ/3 close to φ in C 0 -topology, then for any g ∈ Diff 1ω (M )

Since f ∈ G ′ , there exists N ∈ N such that |∆ϕm (fn ) − ∆ϕm (f )| ≤ 3ǫ for all n > N . Hence,
|∆φ (fn ) − ∆φ (f )| < ǫ for all n > N . This shows that each f ∈ G ′ is a continuity point of the maps
g 7→ ∆φ (g) for any φ ∈ C 0 (M, R). Then for any f ∈ G ′′ := G ∩ G ′ , we have
• P (f, φ) = ∆φ (f ) = supK P (f |K , φ|K ).
• f is a continuity point of the maps g 7→ ∆φ (g) for any φ ∈ C 0 (M, R), where g ∈ Diff 1ω (M ).
By the structual stability of horseshoe and the continuity of the potential function, each f ∈ G ′′ is
a lower semicontinuity point for the map f :7→ P (f, φ) for each fixed φ.
For any α > 0, any f ∈ G ′′ , any fe ∈ Diff 1ω (M ) C 1 -close to f (we take it to be so close to f such

semicontinuity together imply continuiy and Theorem 1.2 is proved.

precisely. for any f and any α > 0, there exists N1 , such that for every 1 ≤ k ≤ d0 , every

Proof. This is a trivial generalization of [11, Proposition 5.8]. We point out that the residual subset
G of Eω (M ) does not depend on the potential function φ because it is given by Corollary 2.10. 
By Lemma 4.5 and Lemma 4.6, we have proved Theorem 1.3.
5. No Equilibrium states with positive entropy
In this section, we will prove that for generic diffeomorphism in Eω (M ) and any continuous
potential function, there is no equilibrium states with positive measure theoreitic entropy.
5.1. A concentration phenomenon for ergodic measures with large pressure.
Let R ⊂ Eω (M ) be a dense Gδ subset on which for every φ ∈ C 0 (M, R)
1: f 7→ P (f, φ) is continuous and
2: P (f, φ) = max1≤k≤d0 σk (f, φ) = ∆φ (f ).
We will need the following perturbation lemma, it will be the key to prove the non-existence of
equlibrium states with positive entropy.
Lemma 5.1. For any g ∈ R, any continuous potential function φ, any η ∈ (0, η0 (g)), any δ > 0,
and any periodic saddle O for g, there exists N0 ≥ 0 with the following property.
For any ρ > 0, there is an f0 ∈ R that is η-close to g and satisfies:

3: for any 1 ≤ k ≤ d0 , any E ∈ Grassk (T M ), and any n ≥ N0 ,
log | Jac(f0n , E)| + Sn φ(πk (E)) ≤ (P (f0 , φ) + δ)n
Remark 5.2. This is very similar to the construction in [11, Lemma 6.2]. The difference is the
choice of N2 in the proof. Also notice that the difference between item 3 of this theorem and Lemma
4.4 is that N0 here does not depend on f0 and ρ.
Proof. Let η0 (g) > 0 be small enough such that for any f that are η0 (g)-close to g in C 1 -distance,
we have supE∈Grassk (T M) | Jac(f, E)| ≤ 2 supE∈Grassk (T M) | Jac(g, E)|. The construction of the first
two items are the same as that of [11, Lemma 6.2].
We first define the following for each 0 ≤ k ≤ d0 ,

1: An integer N1 = N1 (g, δ) such that for any diffeomorphism f C 1 -close to g, any E ∈

2: A diffeomorphism G on the tangent bundle TO M , defined as follow. Let Vr be the union
of the r-balls at the the origin in each Tx M, x ∈ O. Then we can find a diffeomorphism G
of TO M and 0 < r1 < 1 < r2 < ∞ such that
• G coincides with Dg(x) outside the unit balls of each space Tx M, x ∈ O, and with
Ux ◦ Dg(x) on Vr1 ∩ Tx M ,
• G is η/2-close to Dg|O , and
• if kuk ≥ r2 , then kGn (u)k ≥ 1 for either all n ≥ 0 or all n ≤ 0.
The first two items follow from Franks’ Lemma, and the third item requires a little bit
explaination. Note that O is a saddle for Dg|O , then let C > 0, λ ∈ (0, 1) be the constants
in the definition of hyperbolic set. And let u = us + uu ∈ Tx M = E s (x) ⊕ E u (x), kuk ≥ r2 .
Then for those u with kus k/kuk ≤ 1 − 1/(Cr2 ), we have the following estimates,

Let Λ be the maximal invariant set of G in Vr2 . Let y ∈ Vr2 , if O(y) ⊂ Vr2 , then
O(y) ⊂ Λ. Hence the item 3 in the above construction of G implies that σk (G, φ) is well
defined and satisfies
σk (G, φ) = max(σk (G|Λ, φ), σk (Dg|O , φ)) = σk (G|Λ, φ)

Construction of f0 .
Franks’ Lemma (conservative version) gives a diffeomorphism g ′ which is linear in a small neighborhood of O and arbitrarily close to g. The dynamics near O for g ′ can be identified with the
linear cocycle Dg over the tangent bundle TO M in an obvious way. We choose R > 0 to be small
and define a perturbation h of g by replacing g ′ in a small neighborhood of O by the diffeomorphism GR : z 7→ RG(R−1 z). Note that we identified the tangent bundle TO M with M in a small
neighborhood of O. In particular, h preserves the set ΛR := RΛ and σk (h|ΛR ) = σk (G|Λ). Also,
the Jacobian is not changed. Hence, GR satisfies the same inequality with the same N2 as G. If we
take R to be so small (this means ΛR is small) that the variation of the potential function φ near
each point in the periodic orbit O is smaller than δ/18. Then for n ≥ N2 ,
log | Jac(GR |ΛnR , E) + Sn φ(πk (E))| ≤ (σk (GR |ΛR ) +

log | Jac(GR |ΛnR , E) + Sn φ(πk (E))| ≤ (σk (GR |ΛR , φ) + δ/3)n
Let N = max(N1 , N2 ). We can choose R to be arbitrarily small once N is given. It is then clear
that any piece of orbit of h of length N coinside with a piece of orbit of g ′ or of GR . Hence, for
any E ∈ Grassk (Tx M ),
log | Jac(hN , E)| + SN φ(πk (E)) < (max(σk (GR |ΛR , φ), σk (g ′ , φ)) + δ/3)N ≤ (σk (h, φ) + δ/3)N
Note that N only depends on g and G. (This is very important for the following proof.) For each
k, choose µ ∈ Perg (h) with σk (h, φ, µ) > σk (h, φ) − δ/12. By Mañé’s Ergodic Closing lemma(2.10),
there is a perturbation h′ with a periodic point p such that σk (h′ , φ, p) > σk (h, φ, µ) − δ/12. Franks’
Lemma (conservative version) gives a further perturbation h′′ with p a periodic saddle of it and
σk (h′′ , φ, p) > σk (h′ , φ, p)− δ/12. By the stability of hyperbolic periodic point p, for any f0 C 1 -close
to h′′ , there is a periodic saddle p′ for f0 close to p such that σk (f0 , φ, p′ ) > σk (h′′ , φ, p) − δ/12.
Hence, we can choose f0 ∈ R which also satisfies the first two items of this Lemma
P (f0 , φ) ≥ σk (f0 , φ) > σk (h, φ) − δ/3

Proposition 5.3. Fix ǫ, α ∈ (0, 1), φ ∈ C 0 (M, R). Then for any f0 in a dense subset of Eω (M ),
there is a constant δ > 0 and a periodic orbit O ⊂ M such that for any f ∈ Eω (M ) C 1 -close to f0

Remark 5.4. This is a routine generalization of [11, Propostion 6.1]. Let z be a point in the
support of an ergodic measure that is Lyapunov
regular and satisfies Birkhoff ’s Ergodic Theorem
S
applied to the indicator function of M \ x∈O Bf (x, ǫ, #O). The idea of the proof is using the fact
that the growth rate of the logarithm of Jacobian when the iteration of the point z is inside a small
neighborhood of the periodic orbit is larger. (This is because that we can perturb the system near
the periodic orbit by Lemma 5.1)This will force the iteration of z to stay close to the periodic orbit
very often since z is a point in the support of a ergodic measure with large pressure. In the proof,
we will need Lemma 5.1 and the fact that N0 only denpends on N , φ, δ, g and the Riemannian
metric.
Proof. We fix φ, ǫ, α and let g ∈ R. Pick an arbitrarily small number 0 < η ≤ η0 (g) with η0 (g) as

Proposition 5.5. There is a dense Gδ set G ⊂ Eω (M ) such that for any ǫ, α ∈ (0, 1), any f ∈ G

Proof. Let {ϕ1 , ϕ2 , . . . , ϕn , . . . } be dense in C (M, R). Fix rational ǫ, α, let f0 ∈ V(ǫ, α, n) be the
dense set in Proposition 5.3, Vf0 ,ǫ,α,n be the open set ofSf0 satisfying the conclusion of Proposition
5.3 with ϕn the potential function. Then the union f0 ∈V(ǫ,α,n) Vf0 ,ǫ,α,n is open and dense in

hµ (f ) + φ dµ > P (f, φ) − δ

then because {ϕ1 , ϕ2 , . . . , ϕn , . . . } is dense in C 0 (M, R), there is a sequence

Hence, for k large enough, P (f, ϕnk )− ϕnk dµ < hµ (f )+δ. This implies µ M \ x∈O Bf (x, ǫ, #O) <

5.2. Non-existence of Equlibrium States with positive entropy.
Proof of Theorem1.4. Let f be in the dense Gδ set G ⊂ Eω (M ) as in the Proposition 5.5. Assume
that there is a equilibrium state µ ∈ Perg (f ) for (f, φ) with positive entropy. By Katok’s entropy
formula [20], we have the following,
1
hµ (f ) = lim lim sup log rf (µ, ǫ, n)
ǫ→0 n→∞ n
where rf (µ, ǫ, n) is the minimal number of Bowen balls Bf (x, ǫ, n) needed to cover a set of µ-measure
greater than 1/2. (1/2 can be replaced by any number between 0 and 1)
Let us fix ǫ > 0 and some ǫ-dense finite set A ⊂ M . Let 0 < α ≪ 1/ log(#A). The Proposition
5.5 gives δ > 0 and a periodic orbit O ⊂ M (where A is disjoint from O). Write N = #O for
convenience. The fact that hµ (f ) > 0 implies N goes to infinity as ǫ goes to zero. If this is not
true, µ will be an atomic measure by Proposition 5.5. This gives us zero measure entropy which
contradicts our assumption.
We need to bound rf (µ, ǫ, n) for large n. For each n, define Zn to be the set of all points z ∈ M
such that
[
#{0 ≤ k < m : f k (z) ∈
/
Bf (x, ǫ, N )} < mα, ∀m ≥ n
x∈O

The above inequality is equivalent to the following,
hm (z) :=
T

m−1
1 X T
1 x∈O Bfc (x,ǫ,N )(f k (z)) < α, ∀m ≥ n

This implies that Zn = m≥n h−1
is measurable. Then Z1 ⊂ Z2 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Zn ⊂ · · · is a
m (−∞, α)S
nest sequence of measurable sets and Z := ∞
n=1 Zn has µ-measure 1 by Birkhoff ergodic theorem.
By the continuity of measure, we have limn→∞ µ(Zn ) = µ(Z) = 1. Hence there exist n1 such that

TOPLOGICAL PRESSURE FOR CONSERVATIVE C 1 -DIFFEOMORPHISMS WITH NO DOMINATED SPLITTING

µ(Zn1 ) ≥ 1/2. Using the same counting argument as in the proof of [11, Theorem 2], we have the
following,

where H(t) = −t log t − (1 − t) log(1 − t).
R
Since µ is an equilibrium state, hµ (f ) + φ dµ > P (f, φ) − δ for any δ > 0, we can take ǫ,
α log(#A) arbitrarily small. We then conclude that
hµ (f ) = lim lim sup
ǫ→0 n→∞

log rf (µ, ǫ, n) = 0

which is a contradiction.

Remark 5.6. There is no essential difference between proof of Theorem 1.4 and the proof of [11,
Theorem 2]. We add the proof here with more details for completeness.
6. Equlibrium states on compact surfaces with zero Lyapunov exponents
We will restrict to the case of compact surface in this entire section.
Since M is a compact surface, we have ∆(f, p) = λ+ (f, p). By Theorem 1.1, we know that ,

closing lemma, we also have the following,
Z
P (f, φ) = sup {λ+ (f, µ) + φ dµ}
µ∈Perg (f )

R
By Theorem 1.4, if there is an equlibrium state, say ν, thenR we must have φ dνR= P (f, φ).
This implies that λ+ (f, ν) = 0. Conversely, if λ+ (f, ν) = 0, φ dν = supµ∈Perg (f ) φ dµ and
R
R
λ+ (f, µ) + φ dµ ≤ φ dν for any ergodic measure µ, then we have ν is an equilibrium state for
(f, φ).

As mentioned in the introduction section, for φm (x) := − m
log kDx f m k, m ∈ N, we have the
following result.
Proposition 6.1. There exists a residual subset G of Eω (M ), such that for any f ∈ G, there exists
m ∈ N such that there exist an equilibrium state for (f, φm ).

Proof. By [23], we can find an elliptic periodic point p for f , let m denote the period of p. For any
ergodic measure µ, by Oseledets’ Theorem [25] and Birkhoff’s Ergodic Theorem, we can find a set
of measure 1 such that for any point x in it, we have the following,

For the elliptic periodic point p, let µp be the corresponding atomic measure.
R It is clear that we

have φm (p) = − m
log kDp f m k = 0 and λ+ (f, µp ) = 0. This gives λ+ (f, µp ) + φm dµp = 0. There
fore for any ergodic measure µ,
Z
Z
λ+ (f, µ) + φm dµ ≤ λ+ (f, µp ) + φm dµp = 0
Hence µp is an equilibrium state for (f, φm ).



We can also consider the family of potential function tφm for t ≥ 0. It is clear from the
Proposition 6.1 that for t ≥ 1, there exists at least one equilibrium state for (f, tφm ). And for
t = 0, we have that P (f, 0) = htop (f ), and there is no equilibrium states for C 1 -generic conservative
diffeomorphism without a dominated splitting by a result of [11]. It is also a special case of Theorem
1.4. Since P (f, tφm ) is continuous with respect to t [33] and is monotone decreasing as t getting
larger, there is a phase transition point t0 . More specifically, we have the following.
1
log kDx f m k. Let
Proposition 6.2. Let f ∈ G and m ∈ N as in Proposition 6.1, φm := − m

where T (p) is the period of p, S(f ) is the set of all the hyperbolic periodic point of f . If 0 ≤ t < t0 ,
there is no equilibrium states for (f, tφm ) and if t ≥ t0 , there is an equilibrium state with zero
entropy.
Proof. Since P (f, tφm ) is continuous with respect to t, min{t | P (f, tφm ) = 0} can be achieved. By
Theorem 1.1,
T (p)−1
X
t
+
φm (f i (p))}
P (f, tφm ) = sup {λ (f, p) +

Since supµ∈Perg (f )

R

φm dµ = 0, (f, tφm ) has equilibrium states if and only if P (f, tφm ) = 0.

By the definition of t0 , there is no equilibrium states if 0 ≤ t < t0 .
Since φm is negative,
R P (f, tφm ) is non-increasing with respect to t. For the elliptic periodic point
p of period m, hµp + tφm dµp = 0. By the Variational Principle of topological pressure and the
fact that P (f, tφm ) is non-increasing with respect to t, we have for all t ≥ t0 , P (f, tφm ) = 0. Hence
(f, tφm ) will have equilibrium state with zero entropy if t ≥ t0 .

For any elliptic periodic point q with period l, a factor of m (including fixed points) will also
give a different equilibrium state µq , so in general, the equilibrium states are not unique.
Notice that a simple perturbation of φm fixing the value on elliptic periodic orbits will also have
equilibrium states. So it seems that the existence of equilibrium states with zero entropy is not
that rare. However, we also have the following lemma, which implies that C 0 -generic potential
function will not have an atomic measure as equlibrium states. (Since for C 1 -generic conservative
diffeomorphism, we only have countably many periodic points)
Lemma 6.3. Let f be a C 1 -generic conservative diffeomorphism of M , let M be a countable set of
ergodic measures which are not supported on a hyperbolic
periodic orbit. Then there exists
R
a residual subset A in C 0 (M, R). such that if φ ∈ A, then φ dµ does not attain its maximum on
M.
Remark 6.4. This lemma holds for d0 -dimensional manifold for any d0 ≥ 2.
R
R
Proof. Suppose that φ dµ = supν∈Perg (f ) { φ dν} for some µ ∈ M. By Corollary 2.11, for C 1 generic conservative diffeomorphism f , there is a sequence of atmoic measure µn supported on
hyperbolic periodic orbit On , such that µn converges to µ in vague topology. Then for any ǫ > 0,
there exists N ∈ N such that for any n > N , we have

We pose the following questions on the equilibrium states of (f, φm ) for any C 1 generic consevative
diffeomorphisms f without a dominated splitting.
Question 6.5. Is the number of ergodic equilibrium states at most countable for f ?
Question 6.6. Are the ergodic equilibrium states for f all atomic measures supported on an elliptic
periodic orbit?
It will be good to understand some ergodic and statistical properties of those equilibrium states
with zero entropy. In order to have a good understanding, we need to know the properties of
those ergodic measures with zero Lyapunov exponents. This might be hard in general, so the
discussion on these kind of topics is not included in this paper. What is clear is that those atomic
measure supported on periodic orbit can not be weak mixing. So in general, if we do not add more
assumptions, we can not get a very strong conclusion.
