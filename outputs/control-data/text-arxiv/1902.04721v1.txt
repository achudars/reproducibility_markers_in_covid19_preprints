Abstract—Cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
are recently getting significant attention due to various practical
use cases, e.g., surveillance, data gathering, purchase delivery,
among other applications. Since UAVs are low power nodes,
energy and spectral efficient communication is of paramount
importance. To that end, multiple access (MA) schemes can
play an important role in achieving high energy efficiency and
spectral efficiency. In this work, we introduce rate-splitting MA
(RSMA) and non-orthogonal MA (NOMA) schemes in a cellularconnected UAV network. In particular, we investigate the energy
efficiency of the RSMA and NOMA schemes in a millimeterwave (mmWave) downlink transmission scenario. Furthermore,
we optimize precoding vectors of both the schemes by explicitly
taking into account the 3GPP antenna propagation patterns. The
numerical results for this realistic transmission scheme indicate
that RSMA is superior to NOMA in terms of overall energy
efficiency.
Index Terms—3GPP, antenna propagation patterns, cellularconnected, energy efficiency, mmWave, NOMA, RSMA, UAVs.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in wireless
networks is considered a key component of next generation
communications systems [1]–[3]. Beside improving the network
coverage through broadband mobile data delivery, UAVs
have already become one of the major building blocks of
various applications involving public safety, disaster relief, and
surveillance, to name a few. In order to speed up deployment
of UAVs in communications scenarios, one common approach
is to employ UAVs as an integral part of the terrestrial wireless
networks. By this way, infrastructure costs associated with
serving flying UAVs are aimed to decrease as much as possible
by making use of the existing network capabilities.
In the cellular-connected UAV concept, existing terrestrial
wireless networks serve flying UAVs while their primary users
are placed on the ground. The terrestrial BSs therefore have
long-term relatively static features (e.g., down-tilted transmit
antenna arrays) which are optimized considering ground users.
The propagation pattern can, however, be shaped taking into
account not only the ground users but also the desired UAVs
through advanced beamforming techniques. A more viable
approach in simultaneously serving UAVs and ground users

& Development (LDRD) Program under DOE Idaho Operations Office Contract
DE-AC07-05ID14517.

is to use state-of-the-art multiple access (MA) transmission
schemes. By adequately allocating available resources (e.g.,
power, time-frequency slots), the interference that arises when
serving multiple users simultaneously can be handled effectively
through novel MA techniques.
Non-orthogonal MA (NOMA) is identified as a promising
MA scheme for 5G and beyond cellular communication
technologies which can also be a smart solution for cellularconnected UAV scenarios [4], [5]. The NOMA transmission
enables serving multiple UAVs at the same time, frequency and
space resources enhancing the spectral efficiency. However,
NOMA may not be the optimal MA scheme for multipleinput single-output (MISO) broadcast channels, except under
overloaded conditions (i.e., user channels are highly correlated
and not orthogonal). Moreover, the optimal user pairing and
decoding order are two main drawbacks of the NOMA strategy
in practical applications, which increase the system complexity.
Space division MA (SDMA) on the other hand is more
suitable for underloaded conditions which however achieves
degraded performance when network load is high. Recently,
rate splitting MA (RSMA) is receiving significant attention
as an effective MA scheme for next generation wireless
communication systems. RSMA is preferable irrespective of
the loading condition. In fact, RSMA enables soft bridging
between two extremes, NOMA and SDMA [6].
In this work, we investigate the energy efficiency of various
MA schemes in a downlink mmWave cellular-connected UAV
network. In particular, we consider RSMA and NOMA as
two MA schemes of interest, and optimize each scheme to
maximize the energy efficiency. Furthermore, we assume that
the BS serving the desired UAVs actually belongs to a next
generation terrestrial wireless network, and that the transmit
antenna array is therefore composed of antenna elements having
3GPP propagation patterns. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first time that the energy efficiency of MA schemes are
being studied in the context of cellular-connected mmWave
UAV network with realistic propagation patterns. The numerical
results verify the superiority of RSMA to NOMA in terms of
energy efficiency in different scenarios.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II,
the system model along with mmWave channel model and
3GPP antenna patterns are presented. The MA schemes are
considered in Section III together with exact energy efficiency

each user to separate data streams, RSMA suggests to transmit
a “common” part of all user messages jointly, and the rest of
each user message through different streams called “private”.
At the receiver side, each user is expected to decode first the
common message (in the presence of all private messages),
cancel the effect of this common message from the received
signal, and decode its own private message (in the presence of
the other private messages).
We assume that the BS encodes part of each stream to
be transmitted to a particular UAV as the common message,
denoted by sc . The rest of the stream for each UAV is then
considered as private message, and is encoded into stream
sk for the kth UAV. In order to mitigate the interference as
much as possible, we consider different beamforming vectors
for each private message as well as the common message.
Assuming that wk and wc represent the beamforming vectors
for the private message of the kth UAV and the common
message, respectively, the overall beamforming matrix can
be given as W = [wc w1 . . . wK ]. In addition, the transmit
signal at the BS after precoding is given as x = Ws where
s = [sc s1 . . . sK ] is the overall message vector.

In the NOMA strategy, kth UAV is expected to first decode
messages of the other UAVs allocated more power (i.e., with
the index m > k). This decoding is performed by treating the
UAVs allocated less power (i.e., with the index m < k) as noise.
Each decoded message is then subtracted from the received
signal in (16) through SIC, and kth UAV finally decodes its
own message sk . In this approach, the the SINR associated
with decoding the message of the mth UAV (at the kth UAV

The NOMA strategy relies on the fact that user messages
are distinct enough in the power domain, and each receiver can
decode its desired message using the SIC approach. To this
end, the NOMA transmitter allocates adequate power to each
UAV’s message, which requires the knowledge of the channel
condition for each UAV. Without any loss of generality, the
UAVs with indices from N = {1, . . . , K} are ordered from the
one allocated less power to the one allocated more power, and
that BS has this information perfectly. Although the power
allocation is jointly optimized in the sequel along with the
beamforming matrix W, it is worth noting that the NOMA
strategy proceeds with allocating less power to the UAVs having
better channel conditions, and vice versa.
Assuming that wk is the beamforming vector for the kth
UAV, the transmit signal at the BS after precoding is given as
x = Ws where W = [w1 . . . wK ]. The received signal at the

C. Successive Convex Approximation (SCA)
The energy efficiency optimization problems for RSMA
and NOMA given by (14) and (20), respectively, are highly
non-convex. Thus, we need to come up with an approximate
algorithm to solve these optimization problems efficiently. As
in [16], we adopt the SCA algorithm [17] as a good match
for this problem. The algorithm proposes to approximate
the non-convex objective function (or the functions in the
constraints) using the first-order Taylor expansion around a
given initial point. By this way, the problem is converted
to a convex optimization problem, and can therefore be
solved efficiently using standard optimization toolboxes (e.g.,
CVX [18], YALMIP [19]). The algorithm proceeds through
iterations such that the optimal values of the variables in the
first iteration are employed as the initial values for the next
iteration. This procedure is repeated until the convergence is
achieved.

served by a terrestrial BS, where the transmit array employs
the 3GPP antenna propagation patterns. We also assume that
the BS serves the desired UAVs simultaneously using either
RSMA or NOMA as the MA scheme. We show that the energy
efficiency of either RSMA or NOMA varies non-monotonically

that the performance gap of RSMA and NOMA appears to be
more significant in favor of RSMA in this particular setting
(as compared to that of Fig. 4).
