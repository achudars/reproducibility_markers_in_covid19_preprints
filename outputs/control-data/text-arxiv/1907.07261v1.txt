ABSTRACT
We present results of long-slit and panoramic spectroscopy of extended gaseous disks in 18 nearby
S0 galaxies, mostly in groups. The gas in our S0s is found to be often accreted from outside that
is implied by its decoupled kinematics: at least 5 galaxies demonstrate strongly inclined large-scale
ionized-gas disks smoothly coupled with their outer HI disks, 7 galaxies reveal circumnuclear polar
ionized-gas disks, and in NGC 2551 the ionized gas though confined to the main galactic plane
however counterrotates the stellar component. The ionized-gas excitation analysis reveals the gas
ionization by young stars in 12 of 18 S0 galaxies studied here; the current star formation in these
galaxies is confined to the ring-like zones coinciding with the UV-rings. The gas oxygen abundance
estimates in the rings are closely concentrated around the value of 0.7 Z and do not correlate either
with the ring radius nor with the metallicity of the underlying stellar population. By applying the
tilted-ring analysis to the 2D velocity fields of the ionized gas, we have traced the orientation of
the gas rotation-plane lines of nodes along the radius. We have found that current star formation
proceeds usually just where the gas lies strictly in the stellar disk planes and rotates there circularly;
the sense of the gas rotation does not matter (the counterrotating gas in NGC 2551 forms stars
currently). In the galaxies without signs of current star formation the extended gaseous disks are
either in steady-state quasi-polar orientation (NGC 2655, NGC 2787, NGC 3414, UGC 9519), or
are acquired recently through the highly inclined external filaments provoking probably shock-like
excitation (NGC 4026, NGC 7280). Our data imply crucial difference of the external-gas accretion
regime in S0s with respect to spiral galaxies: the geometry of the gas accretion in S0s is typically
off–plane.

Ionized gas in S0 galaxies

1. INTRODUCTION

Lenticular galaxies were introduced as a distinct morphological type in the latest version of the
‘Hubble fork’ – the galaxy morphology scheme by Hubble (1936); they were considered by Edwin
Hubble as a transition type between ellipticals and spirals and by definition had large-scale stellar
disks but lacked spiral arms and intense star formation. Since the global structures of lenticular and
spiral galaxies were very similar (see e.g., Laurikainen et al. 2010), and the only prominent difference
was red color of the disks and absence of noticeable star formation regions within them, an idea had
been formulated rather early that lenticular galaxies were former spirals devoid of gas (‘they show
no trace of gas or anything of the sort’, Baade 1975). However further observations in the 21 cm
line had shown that S0 galaxies could be rather rich in neutral hydrogen (see e.g., van Driel & van
Woerden 1991). The origin of this gas and reasons of the frequent absence of current star formation
in the gas-rich S0s remain unclear up to now.
Although lenticular galaxies typically have lower ratio of cold gas mass to their luminosity than
spiral galaxies (Knapp, Turner, and Cunniffe 1985), it has been found that neutral and even molecular
gas is present perhaps in most of them (Welch & Sage 2003; Sage & Welch 2006; Welch, Sage, &
Young 2010), though less than half of gas-rich S0 galaxies with extended cold-gas disks experience
current star formation of HII-region type (Pogge & Eskridge 1993). The kinematics of ionized gas
in S0s is often decoupled from that of their stellar disks that had allowed to Bertola, Buson, and
Zeilinger (1992) to conclude that at least 40% of emission-line S0s acquired their gas from some
external sources rather recently. Later a factor of environment was found to be important: the study
by Davis et al. (2011) and by Serra et al. (2012) showed that among Virgo cluster S0s the gaseous
and stellar components revealed almost always strict kinematical alignment while the non-Virgo
S0s, those in groups and in the field, demonstrated decoupled gas kinematics in 50% of all cases.
By following this logic, we have studied strongly isolated S0s which represent the extreme case of
sparse environment. We observed them with the long-slit spectrographs by aligning our slits with the
photometric major axes (which are thought to trace the orientation of the stellar-disk lines of nodes
in the case of intrinsically round stellar disks.). Our results (Katkov, Sil’chenko, and Afanasiev 2014;
Katkov, Kniazev, and Sil’chenko 2015) have confirmed that without external forces to remove the
gas, lenticular galaxies demonstrate extended ionized-gas disks in more than 70% of all cases, and
about half of them reveal gas counter-rotation with respect to their stellar components. If the gas
has been accreted by S0s from outside, such statistics implies that the directions of gas inflow are
distributed isotropically. However, in the case of strongly isolated S0s the problem of searching for
external gas source (donors) remains unsolved.
Another interesting question which has intrigued us since then is the incidence of star formation
in gas-rich S0s. In our sample of isolated S0s (Katkov et al. 2014, 2015) we found that both the
gas ionized by young stars and the gas excited by shocks could be met in the disks, and it was not
the amount of the gas that governed this dichotomy. By comparing the projections of the gas and
star rotation velocities onto the line of sight along the spectrograph slit (aligned with the stellar-disk
major axis), we have suspected that star formation proceeds when the gas lies strictly in the planes of
stellar disks, independently on the gas spin direction – coincident with the stellar-component spin or
antiparallel to it. However, we cannot determine exactly the orientation of the gas rotation plane by
observing it only with the long slit; panoramic spectroscopy is needed. In this paper we just present
the results of our complex study of the ionized gas in 18 S0s for which we have undertaken both

using the facilities of the Russian 6-m telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory of Russian
Academy of Sciences (SAO RAS).
2. SAMPLE

The sample includes 18 S0 and S0/a galaxies with rather extended gaseous disks detected in
optical-band emission lines; the presence of such disks is either known from our previous works,
e.g. Sil’chenko, Moiseev, and Afanasiev (2009), Ilyina, Sil’chenko, and Afanasiev (2014), Proshina,
Kniazev, and Sil’chenko (2019), or is suspected from extended ultraviolet signal reported in Gil de
Paz et al. (2007). To select the targets suitable to be studied with the scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer, we have firstly undertaken long-slit spectroscopy to trace emission lines toward their
full extension; and so on our sample of nearby S0s is biased toward gas-rich objects. The sample is
not representative over neither galaxy characteristics; it is not volume- or magnitudelimited. However, the absolute-magnitude range of the galaxies under consideration covers full
range of S0 luminosities, which is from MB = −18 to MB = −22 according to van den Bergh (2009)
(Fig. 1, left), and the galaxies are homogeneously red belonging all to the red sequence (Fig. 1, right).
The list of their integrated properties assembled over literature is given in Table 1. The majority of
our galaxies, 13 of 18, demonstrate rings of various size including those seen in the far ultraviolet,
according to the GALEX data, so betraying possible recent star formation. Interestingly, our ringed
S0s are mostly unbarred.

Our long-slit spectral observations were made with the multi–mode focal reducer SCORPIO
(Afanasiev & Moiseev 2005) and its improved version SCORPIO-2 (Afanasiev & Moiseev 2011)
installed at the prime focus of the SAO RAS 6m telescope. Both devices have the same slit size
(6.0 1 in length and 100 in width) with a scale along the slit of 0.00 36/px, while for a similar spectral
resolution SCOPRIO-2 provides a twice larger spectral range. With the SCOPRIO-2 we exposed
the full optical spectral range, namely 3700–7200 Å, by using the volume-phase holographic grating
VPHG1200@540 provided spectral resolution of about 5 Å, whereas with the SCORPIO we probed

VPHG2300G, VPHG1800R, and VPHG1200R providing the resolution of about 2, 2.5, and 5 Å, correspondingly. The log of the observations is presented in Table 2, the positions of the spectrograph
slit against the galaxies images are shown in the Fig. 4.
The data were reduced by a standard way using the IDL software package developed in SAO RAS.
It is at the edges of the slit that we derived the sky background to subtract it from the galaxy spectra,
by applying the linear or polynomial (with the degree of 2–3) fit of the sky background distribution
along the slit at every wavelength. Inhomogeneties of the optics transmittance and variations of the
spectral resolution along the slit were taken into account by using the high signal-to-noise acquisitions
of the twilight spectra. The stellar kinematics was analysed by cross–correlating binned spectra with
spectra of K-giant stars observed the same nights as the galaxies; the description of this technique
and references on the original papers are presented in our previous papers, e.g. Sil’chenko et al.
(2009). The emission lines, namely, the Hα, [NII]λ6583, and [OIII]λ5007 first of all, were used to
derive ionized-gas kinematics, by measuring baricenter positions of the lines; in the central bins where

the stellar continuum is strong we applied gauss-analysis to take into account effects of underlying
Balmer absorption lines and also TiI under [OIII]λ5007. For the latter purpose, we binned the
spectra along the slit to reach signal-to-noise ratio higher than 50-70, and then made gauss-analysis of
the line complexes [NII]λ6548,6583+Hα(emission)+Hα(absorption), Hβ(emission)+Hβ(absorption),
[OIII]λ5007(emission)+TiIλ5007(absorption)+TiIλ5015(absorption). With this analysis we are also
able to derive the equivalent width of Hα line (EWHα ) and the flux ratios of the strong emission
lines: [NII]λ6583 to Hα, [OIII]λ5007 to Hβ, [SII]λ6717 to [SII]λ6731, and Σ[SII] to Hα, which can
be used to diagnose the gas excitation mechanisms with the BPT-diagrams (Baldwin, Phillips, and
Terlevich 1981) and to determine the gas oxygen abundances for the emission-line regions where the
gas is excited by young stars. The example of the emission/absorption lines decomposition near the
center of NGC 3619 is shown in Fig. 2. The sensitivity variations along the wavelength range were
corrected by observing spectrophotometric standard stars the same nights as the galaxies.
As it will be noted further, we study the distribution of the above mentioned emission lines along
the slits in more details for two galaxies – NGC 2551 and NGC 3166. Their spectra demonstrate very
extended emission of diffuse ionized gas together with compact bright clumps. For this particular
analysis we consider the spatial distribution of the line flux ratios measured by fitting single Gaussians
to the observed lines at each position along the slit after subtracting the spectra of stellar population
models obtained with the ULySS software Koleva et al. (2009), as is shown in Fig. 3.

Scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) allows to make 3D–spectroscopic study of the ionizedgas kinematics over large field of view, whereas the narrow interfringe spectral range contains
usually only a single emission line selected by a band–pass filter with FWHM of about 15–30 Å.
Using the information from the long–slit spectroscopy we have preliminarily chosen spectral lines in
which the most extended ionized gas emission could be expected: Hα, [NII]λ6583, or [OIII]λ5007.
The targets were observed at the SAO RAS 6m telescope with the SCORPIO-2 in the FPI mode
by using the interferometer providing spectral resolution of FHWM= 1.7 Å (∼ 78 km s−1 ) and full
spectral range (interfringe) of ∆λ = 35 Å around redshifted [NII] or Hα line, whereas in the [OIII]
emission line these parameters were FHWM= 2.0 Å (∼ 120 km s−1 ) and ∆λ = 20 Å. During the
scanning process, we have consecutively obtained few tens of interferograms fixing different gaps
between the FPI plates covering uniformly the interfringe: 40 frames in the Hα or 30 frames in the
[OIII] spectral ranges. The field of view was 6.0 1. The galaxy NGC 3166 was observed with a previous
version of the focal reducer SCORPIO in the Hα emission line using FPI providing FHWM= 2.5 Å
(∼ 112 km s−1 ) and ∆λ = 29 Å, the number of interferograms was 32. The log of the observations
including exposures times and mean seeing values is presented in Table 3. The data were reduced
using the software package described in details by Moiseev (2002) and by Moiseev & Egorov (2008).
Briefly, the used procedures included standard steps for CCD data reduction (bias subtraction, flatfield corrections, sigma clipping of cosmic-ray hits) and some specific steps: removing interference
rings relating with airglow lines using an azimuthal averaging of brightness in each frame with
masked galaxies and stars (see Moiseev 2002); correction of atmospheric transparency as well as
seeing variations and astrometric shifts of individual interferograms basing on the PSF-photometry
of foreground stars; phase-shift correction (wavelength calibration) basing on the scanning of some
selected lines in the spectra of He-Ne-Ar lamp exposed every evening and morning before and after
the observational night. After the primary reduction the observed data are combined into data cubes,
where to each spaxel of the field of view a 30, 32, or 40-channel spectrum is attributed.

The data cubes were rotated to the ‘standard’ orientation (north at the top). The astrometry
grid was created using the Astrometry.net project web-interface1 (Lang et al. 2010). The optical
continuum and monochromatic images in the emission lines, the line-of-sight velocity fields and
velocity dispersion maps were created from the one-component Voigt profile fitting of the spectra as
described in Moiseev & Egorov (2008). All the velocities presented in the paper are heliocentric.
3.3. Ancillary data
By wishing to expand our gas velocity fields and to reach physical interpretation of what we see,
for our analysis we involve some additional data on our galaxies which can be retrieved in open
data archives. In particular, we use SAURON IFU [OIII] emission-line data collected in the frame
of the ATLAS-3D survey (Cappellari et al. 2011) to refine gas velocity fields in the centers of the
galaxies, and we expand our gas velocity fields into the outermost parts of the galaxies by attaching
interferometric HI data (GMRT observations from the archive of http://wow.astron.nl presented
also in Serra et al. 2012 and Lee-Waddell et al. 2012). The star formation regions distributions over
the galactic disks are studied with the GALEX images (Gil de Paz et al. 2007) obtained in the farand near-ultraviolet bands (FUV and NUV). The general structure of the galactic disks is considered
with the photometric data in the optical bands retrieved from the SDSS (http://www.sdss3.org)
and PanSTARRS (https://ps1images.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/ps1cutouts) archives, and also with
the NIR images of the galaxies in 3.6 mkm and 4.5 mkm bands which have been obtained and made
public in the frame of the Spitzer-telescope galaxy survey S4G (Sheth et al. 2010). Finally, four of

our galaxies were observed with the IFU PMAS/PPAK in the frame of the CALIFA survey (GarciaLorenzo et al. 2015; Sánchez et al. 2012, 2016), and for these galaxies we have also used the fully
reduced datacubes taken from the CALIFA archive, http://califa.caha.es.
4. RESULTS

4.1. Kinematics
The Figs. 4 and 6 present the results respectively of our panoramic and long-slit spectroscopy with
the 6m telescope. The optical continuum centers are posed to the coordinate zero points, (0,0) at the
both axes. The maps are smoothed severely to reach the outermost parts of the gaseous disks – to
the typical angular resolution of 200 –300 , so the circumnuclear regions are somewhat poorly resolved.
However in some galaxies a certain turn of the kinematical major axis (defined as the direction of
maximum line-of-sight velocity gradient) in the very center is seen: in NGC 3166, NGC 3414, and
NGC 7280.
In the central regions of about half of the galaxies their spectral stellar-absorption features are rather
deep forcing the faint ionized-gas emission lines to sink. In those cases the observed gas kinematics
can be strongly affected because the small spectral range of the FPI observations does not allow us
to distinguish the contributions of the nebular and stellar components into the integrated spectrum.
In these cases we could not detect emission lines with the expected velocities in the circumnuclear
regions which are blanked in the FPI maps presented in the Fig. 4. Usually the blanked regions
locate asymmetrically relative the galaxy nucleus (see IC 5285, NGC 774, etc.), because these regions
correspond to the maximal contribution of the bulge luminosity against the distant side of the disk.
This situation is invert to the well-known effect of finding more prominent dust lanes at the nearest
side of a galaxy disk. As concerning the [OIII] data, central parts of some emission-line velocity
fields are available from the surveys undertaken with the SAURON spectrograph (Bacon et al. 2001;
Cappellari et al. 2011). So for NGC 3619 and NGC 4026 we have succeeded to combine the [OIII]
velocity fields derived from the SAURON data cubes and from our FPI data. Namely, we replaced
the central pixels in FPI maps with the SAURON fields if the velocity difference exceeds the limit
of about 50 km s−1 . In the resulting fields the nuclear points (where stellar absorption features are
significant) possesses to the SAURON data, while the outer regions retain the FPI measurements with
a better spectral resolution. Figure 5 illustrates this procedure for NGC 3619. The final ‘combined’
velocity fields were involved further in our analysis described below.
The long-slit cross-sections have been mostly obtained with the slit orientation along the photometric major axis which coincides with the stellar-disk line-of-nodes orientation in the case of an
intrinsically round stellar disk. The round intrinsic shape of stellar galactic disks is statistically
confirmed more than once, both from photometric (Rix & Zaritsky 1995; Andersen et al. 2001) and
kinematical (Franx & de Zeeuw 1992; Cappellari 2016) arguments. However in some our galaxies
where the kinematical major axes for the gaseous disks derived from the panoramic spectroscopy
have been found to deviate strongly from the stellar-disk lines of nodes (photometric major axes),
we have observed two long-slit spectra with different slit orientations, both being presented in Fig. 6;
those galaxies are NGC 2655, NGC 2787, NGC 3414, and NGC 7280. Below we give some comments
on the individual galaxies.
IC 5285. This luminous S0/a galaxy looks a double-ringed one in continuum, with the outer ring
being completely detached from the main disk. Interestingly, being mapped in the emission line Hα

corresponds to the brightest-continuum bin along the slit (to the galactic nucleus).

, instead of the outer ring, it reveals a pair of gaseous spirals started from the tips of the inner ring
(Fig. 4). Perhaps, the inner ring borders a triaxial bulge because the major axis of the inner ring is
turned with respect to the kinematical major axis; evident non-circular gas motions are seen in the
center of the galaxy. In general, the gaseous disk corotates the stellar component (Fig. 6).
NGC 252. The galaxy was reported as a ringed one by Kostyuk (1975). Later we noted a UV-ring
with a radius about 2500 and reported gas excitation by young stars in the ring (Ilyina et al. 2014).
Now in Fig. 4 we present an Hα disk extended up to ∼ 4000 (15 kpc) from the center and rotating with
a very high speed, about 350 km s−1 . The stars corotate (Ilyina et al. 2014); the lower visible stellar
rotation velocity is perhaps due to asymmetric drift – the stellar disk of NGC 252 may be rather
dynamically hot. In the very center, at R < 700 , low-excitation emission line [NII]λ6583 demonstrates
lower rotation velocities than the Hα (Fig. 6); it implies the possible presence of a triaxial potential
though morphologically the galaxy is classified as unbarred, SA0+.
NGC 774. It is another S0 galaxy with a UV-ring (Gil de Paz et al. 2007); it must possess
even current star formation because recently a core-collapse supernova is detected within the ring
(SN2006ee, 1300 to SE from the center). The ionized gas is asymmetrically distributed over the central
part of the galaxy, within R < 2000 , or R <6 kpc (Fig. 4); beyond the borders of the gaseous disk the
stellar rotation velocity curve falls visibly almost to zero (Fig. 6).
NGC 2551. In this galaxy the UV-ring is very bright and clumpy both in the FUV and in the
NUV, and also is rather wide, from R ≈ 1500 to R ≈ 3000 (2–5 kpc) (Gil de Paz et al. 2007). The
extended ionized-gas disk which is coincident radially with the UV-ring (Fig. 4) counterrotates as
a whole with respect to the stellar disk (Sil’chenko et al. 2009). Earlier we published the long-slit
cross-section along the disk major axis (Sil’chenko et al. 2009); now we present a cross-section under
43◦ to the line of nodes (Fig. 6), confirming the gas counterrotation, and also the falling character of
the stellar rotation curve.
NGC 2655. This galaxy is an object of our long-standing interest. Many years ago we started its
spectral study with three long-slit cross-sections (Sil’chenko & Burenkov 1990); then we noted that
the central part of NGC 2655, R < 500 (0.8 kpc), had quite decoupled gaseous kinematics. Our first
interpretation was that it might be an effect of an active nucleus. Later we had made panoramic
spectroscopy with the IFU MPFS of the 6m telescope, and had changed our opinion: in the center of
NGC 2655 we had detected an inner gaseous disk with polar rotation (Sil’chenko & Afanasiev 2004)
that had then been supported by a dust lane perpendicular to the isophote major axis (Sil’chenko &
Afanasiev 2004). This interpretation was later confirmed by discovery of a strongly warped extended
HI disk around NGC 2655 (Sparke et al. 2008). However now, after inspecting the full LOS velocity
field of the ionized-gas component (Fig. 4) and two orthogonal long-slit cross-sections along the major
and the minor axes of the isophotes (Fig. 6), we are again forced to change our opinion. The general
blue-red asymmetry of the gas LOS velocity field is seen in the east-west direction that is fully
consistent with the orientation of the photometric major axis (stellar-disk line of nodes). The visible
effect of the orthogonal turn of the kinematical major axis near the center is produced by a compact
velocity anomaly just to the north and to the west from the nucleus. But when we inspect the
long-slit cross-sections made under good seeing conditions (Fig. 6), we understand that any rotation
cannot be the reason of this anomaly: the line-of-sight velocity of the gas drops by some 400 km s−1
to the north of the nucleus without any mirrored behavior in the south direction. Interestingly, just
in the same place the stellar velocity dispersion rises enormously (Fig. 7) betraying the presence of

a secondary stellar component with strongly different velocity on our line of sight. Evidently, at
R = 800 to the north of the nucleus and along the circumnuclear dust lane to the west of it we see the
consequence of minor merging – the remnant of a gas-rich dwarf satellite destroyed by gravitational
tides and close in projection to the center of NGC 2655.
NGC 2697. It is a rather low-luminosity S0 galaxy for which no SDSS data were found. We have
made our own gri photometry which results are to be presented elsewhere (Proshina et al. 2019); in
the same paper we analyze also the long-slit kinematics. Here we note only a well-sampled ionized-gas
velocity field (Fig. 4) demonstrating regular circular gas rotation.
NGC 2787. It is one more galaxy where we searched for inner polar disk because of the circumnuclear
dust lane perpendicular to the isophote major axis (Sil’chenko & Afanasiev 2004). Presently, by
exploiting the scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer, we succeeded to trace the gas rotation in the
emission line [NII]λ6583 up to R ≈ 2000 , and we saw a turn of the kinematical major axis over this
radius range (Fig. 4). However, in the emission line [OIII]λ5007, by comparing the rotation velocity
projections for the stars and for the ionized gas exposed with the long slit in two different position
angles (Fig. 6), we see also decoupled gaseous kinematics at R > 2000 quite certainly.
NGC 2962. It is a nearby intermediate-luminosity lenticular galaxy with a detached outer stellar
ring at R ≈ 6500 − 8000 (8–10 kpc). The galaxy was included into the survey ATLAS-3D (Cappellari
et al. 2011), and so panoramic spectroscopy of its central part, R < 1500 , with the IFU SAURON
had provided us with the orientations of the stellar and the ionized-gas rotation planes in its inner
part. We found that they are mutually orthogonal (Sil’chenko 2016), so the galaxy possessed the
inner polar disk. However, the major axis of the outer ring is aligned with the stellar kinematical
major axis, and indeed, our scanning Fabry-Perot data (Fig. 4) confirms that the outer gas rotates
in the main galactic plane. Our long-slit cross-section along the galaxy major axis (Fig. 6) reveals
both effects – that the rotation axis of the gas within R = 1500 is orthogonal to the rotation axis of
the stellar component and that at R ≈ 5000 − 6500 the gas rotation comes into consistency with that
of the stellar disk. The outer ring of NGC 2962 is well seen in the ultraviolet bands FUV and NUV
of the GALEX imaging (Marino et al. 2011, see also our Fig. 13).
NGC 3106. This galaxy, including its gas velocity field, was studied in the frame of the CALIFA
survey (Garcia-Lorenzo et al. 2015). They have found an ‘outer’ starforming ring in this lenticular
galaxy with a radius of some 2000 (8 kpc) (Gomes et al. 2016). However, our data with a much larger
field of view reveals a series of starforming rings in NGC 3106 (Fig. 4), among which the ring reported
by the CALIFA is the innermost one. The galaxy is close to face-on, nevertheless the rotation is

Ionized gas in S0 galaxies

19

visible in Fig. 4, and the orientation of the kinematical major axis is measured quite certainly with
our data.
NGC 3166. This S0/a galaxy belongs to a tight triplet of disk galaxies embedded into a common
HI envelope (Haynes 1981). Many signatures give evidences for the current cold gas accretion onto
NGC 3166 from this huge intergalactic gaseous cloud: young age, ∼ 2 Gyr, of the nuclear stellar
population (Sil’chenko & Afanasiev 2006), large extended molecular-gas reservoir within the galaxy
disk (Taniguchi et al. 1994), strongly lopsided structure of the large-scale stellar disk (Bournaud
et al. 2005), multiple twisted dust filaments within the central bulge-dominated part of the galaxy
(Simoes Lopes et al. 2007). The map in Hα emission line (Fig. 4) shows also asymmetric distribution
of the ionized gas, with a prominent Hα arm at 10000 (11 kpc) to the west from the nucleus. The gas
isovelocities turn in the very center of the galaxy into a polar orientation. In the outer parts the gas
starts to strictly corotate the stars only at R > 6000 (Fig. 6), where the large-scale stellar disk begins
to dominate in the total surface brightness (Sil’chenko et al. 2012).
NGC 3182. Though the galaxy surely lacks a bar, it demonstrates a circumnuclear blue (starforming?) ring with a radius of 5.500 (0.8 kpc). Beyond the ring, different emission lines show different
line-of-sight velocity profiles, the low-ionization [NII]λ6583 being the less rapid, and as a whole the
difference between the projected rotation velocities of the gas and stars is unexpectedly large for such
a low-mass galaxy. We can suspect that this S0 galaxy may possess thick disk of diffuse ionized gas.
Such thick gaseous disks are usually lag the fast equatorial-plane rotation of galactic stellar disks and
demonstrate enhanced low-ionization emission lines [NII] and [SII].
NGC 3414. A real structure of this galaxy remains a complete mystery up to now. It looks like a
round homogeneous body (a spheroid? a face-on disk?) with an overlaid thin filament-like structure
in the orientation of P A ≈ 20◦ . There were various interpretations of such a view: it might be
a face-on S0 with a very strong bar (Baggett et al. 1998; Chitre & Jog 2002), but there were also
suggestions that it was a face-on S0 with a polar ring projected onto the center (Whitmore et al.
1990). In any case, we were not surprised that the gaseous kinematics in NGC 3414 is completely
decoupled from the stellar one (Fig. 6). However, in the very center the gas kinematical major axis
turns to stay along the thin bar-like structure – we have obtained the same result from our data with
the scanning Fabry-Perot in the [OIII]λ5007 line (Fig. 4) and from the archive data obtained earlier
for the central part of the galaxy with the IFU SAURON (Sarzi et al. 2006).
NGC 3619. It is another peculiar lenticular galaxy, settling in a rich group and demonstrating
a system of outer shells (Schweizer & Seitzer 1988) – possible results of close interaction or even
merging. It is rather gas-rich, and the distribution of the neutral hydrogen is unusually compact for
S0s (van Driel et al. 1989). In the optical bands, spiral-like dust lanes are projected against the stellar
body to the south from the nucleus implying a circumnuclear gaseous disk settled asymmetrically
with respect to the stellar one. A UV-bright inner ring has been detected in the GALEX survey
(Cortese & Hughes 2009, see also our Fig. 13). The distribution of the Hα emission is also very
asymmetric and extended (Fig. 4); however the ionized gas demonstrates regular rotation with a
possible small kinematical major-axis turn in the very center. The rotation velocities of the gas and
star components reveal very different projections over the full extension of our measurements (Fig. 6),
so we may suppose different spatial orientations of the stellar and gaseous disks in NGC 3619.
NGC 4026. This edge-on S0 galaxy belongs to a very rich galaxy group, almost cluster, Ursa
Major (Odenwald 1986). The Ursa Major cluster lacks meantime any hot intergalactic medium so

20

Sil’chenko et al.

neutral-hydrogen streams survive easily within its volume. NGC 4026 has been studied in the frame
of the ATLAS-3D survey (Cappellari et al. 2011), and a substantial amount of neutral hydrogen has
been detected not only within its disk, but also as a narrow external filament connecting just to the
galaxy center (Serra et al. 2012). So we expected decoupled gaseous rotation in this galaxy. Indeed,
in the very center the [OIII]λ5007 demonstrates rapidly rotating gaseous disk strongly inclined to the
stellar disk – it is seen in our Fig. 4, as well as in the IFU SAURON emission-line data (Sil’chenko
2016). However, beyond the central region, the ionized gas is strictly confined to the stellar disk, and
its rotation follows the stellar component one exactly (Fig. 6).
NGC 4324. This lenticular galaxy inhabits outskirts of the Virgo cluster, and it is very gas rich (see
the Table 1). It is also a part of the ATLAS-3D survey (Cappellari et al. 2011) and demonstrates a
blue starforming ring with a radius of some 2 kpc which also contains all the molecular gas detected
so far (Alatalo et al. 2013). However, Duprie & Schneider (1996) detected HI up to 2 optical radii
in this galaxy that gave a hope that ionized gas also may be extended beyond the inner starforming
ring. Indeed, in Fig. 4 we see clumpy outer starforming regions up to R ≈ 7000 − 9000 (7.5 kpc) from
the center; most of them take part in the general regular rotation of the gaseous disk. However,
a few – for example that to the north-east from the galaxy – do not participate in the rotation of
NGC 4324 and may be gas-rich satellites.
NGC 7280. It is one more lenticular galaxy which attracts our attention for many years. Once
we had found an inner polar gaseous ring in the center of NGC 7280 (Afanasiev & Sil’chenko 2000).
Later, in the frame of the ATLAS-3D survey, it has been confirmed that the neutral hydrogen
distribution in this galaxy is indeed aligned with the polar axis (Serra et al. 2012). This galaxy was
treated as a gas-rich S0 from the beginning (Chamaraux, Balkowski, and Fontanelli 1987), and star
formation was carefully searched for in its disk (Pogge & Eskridge 1993). But there was no current
star formation found in the disk of NGC 7280. Instead, we have discovered counterrotation of the
ionized gas with respect to the stars beyond the central region, at R > 1000 (Sil’chenko 2005). Now,
with a full map of the ionized-gas velocities (Fig. 4), we confirm the central compact polar disk; the
outer gas is distributed asymmetrically and counterrotates with respect to the stars (Fig. 6).
UGC 9519. It is a dwarf lenticular galaxy elongated in P A = 75◦ . However in the frame of the
ATLAS-3D survey an outer HI ring was found by Serra et al. (2012), well beyond the optical borders
of the galaxy, that is elongated in the north-south direction. The long-slit cross-section along the
isophote major axis (Fig. 6) has confirmed the decoupled kinematics of the gas and its probable
external origin. To obtain a full picture, we have observed UGC 9519 with the scanning Fabry-Perot
interferometer in two emission lines, Hα and [NII]λ6583. Our anticipation has justified: the inner
part of the galaxy, R < 1500 , is well mapped just in the emission line [NII]λ6583 while in the outer part
we resolve the outer starforming ring only in the Hα emission line; Fig. 4 represents a combination
of the [NII] data for the radii less than 2000 and of the Hα data for the more outer galactic regions.
The inner gas rotates in the nearly polar plane with respect to the stellar disk; the outer ionized gas
being related surely to the neutral hydrogen detected by Serra et al. (2012) is quite decoupled from
the main body of the galaxy.
UGC 12840. This galaxy is a giant, isolated (Karachentseva 1973), gas-rich lenticular one. Just
in this galaxy Pogge & Eskridge (1993) had found extended star formation in the outer ring. We
also detect a giant ring, with the radius of some 12.5 kpc, emitting in the Hα emission line (Fig. 4).
Though the galaxy looks almost round, b/a > 0.8, the projection of the rotation velocity is large,

about of ∼ 100 km s−1 – and the ionized gas corotates strictly the stellar component. Some noncircular gas motions are possible in the very center of the galaxy.

Sil’chenko et al.

The profit of two-dimensional velocity fields representing spatially-resolved projection of rotation
velocities at various distances from the galactic centers onto our line of sight, is that we can check
the circular character of the ionized-gas rotation and derive spatial orientation of the rotation plane
if the rotation is circular lacking strong radial motions, expansions or inflows. Indeed, in the
case of circular rotation the maximum rotation-velocity projection onto the line of sight is observed
at the line of nodes; in its turn, the intrinsically round stellar disk looks like an ellipse with the
isophote major axis coincident with the line of nodes. So when the gas is confined to the plane of the
galactic disk and while its rotation is circular, we should see the steepest gradient of the observed
line-of-sight velocity (‘kinematical major axis’) along the isophote major axis. If the gas rotation
is non-circular, that must be the case within a non-axisymmetical potential, the kinematical and
photometric major axes would turn in opposite sense with respect to the line of nodes (Vauterin &
Dejonghe 1997). Finally, if we see that the gas kinematical major axis does not coincide with the
stellar-disk line of nodes, but this deviation is not accompanied by the symmetric deviation of the
photometric major axis within the same radial range, it means that the rotation plane of the ionized
gas stands in the space differently from the plane of the stellar disk.
By assuming ionized-gas planar circular rotation within some running radial range, we can
derive two angles of its spatial orientation, in general varying along the radius: an inclination
of the disk plane to our line of sight and a position angle of its line of nodes tracing gas plane
intersection with the sky plane. We have made it by applying to the gas line-of-sight velocity fields
tilted-ring analysis (Begeman 1989) adopted for the ionized-gas FPI data. For this purpose we
have used the IDL software DETKA, as described by Moiseev et al. (2004) and Moiseev (2014).
The method is based on splitting the observed velocity field into elliptical rings (100 –500 in wide)
oriented according to adopted inclination i0 and line-of-sight position angle of the disk P A0 . In
all observed galaxies the center of symmetry of a velocity field lies no further than 100 –200 from the
photometric nucleus (the center of the inner isophotes), therefore the galaxy nuclei were fixed as the
ring centers. The χ2 -minimization was used to fit the observed velocity distribution within every
ring by model of quasi-circular rotation with following parameters: kinematical major axis P Akin ,
inclination i, rotation velocity Vrot , and systemic velocity Vsys . As a null approximation for P A0
and i0 we adopted the orientation parameters according to the photometric data (HyperLEDA and
isophotal analysis results). During the next steps we fixed often the Vsys derived at the first step.
When the patchy character of a velocity field prevented a stable minimization over three
parameters, we chose to fix firstly the inclination i, and then P Akin ; Vrot remained always
free. Sometimes we applied an iterative procedure, fixing i and P Akin by turns. The i
and P Akin were also always fixed in the outer regions, where the elliptical rings contain only few
points in the velocity fields. We also masked some local regions notable for their peculiar kinematics,
deviating by more than 30 − 50 km s−1 from the obtained model; this threshold was individually
selected.
Unfortunately, in the most cases the direct tilted-ring fitting described above gives unstable solutions just for i(r) due to noises and holes in the ionized-gas velocity fields. The uncomfortable
problem consists of relied unphysical chaotic changes of the Vrot produced by strong derived variations of i with radius. The well-known degeneracy between these two quantities was discussed by numerous authors (Begeman 1989; Kamphuis et al. 2015). To avoid this problem
we performed the following evaluation of the i(r) behavior basing on the first-step tilted-ring

analysis results. Namely, at every r we extracted from the velocity field an elliptical ring oriented
in agreement with i0 and P Akin (r) obtained as described above. Then we fitted the velocities in the
ring using only two free parameters: i and Vrot , whereas the P Akin and Vsys were already obtained at
this radius and fixed. The next step was to repeat the procedure by fixing the obtained
i(r) and by leaving P Akin free to refine it. Finally, we were able to obtain stable fitting results
with a reasonable shape of the rotation curve for the considered galaxies, in their central regions as
minimum. The results of this study, including the analysis of the HI velocity fields available in the
references are presented in Sec. 5.2–5.4.
The comparison of the kinematical major axis orientations running along the radius, with the
stellar-disk lines of nodes is given in Fig. 8. In these plots presenting the tilted-ring analysis results
we have also overlaid the results of isophote analysis – the radial variations of the photometric
major-axis position angles. The lines of nodes are fixed from the outermost isophote major-axis
orientation (sometimes taken outside the plotted radial range). In some cases we have also in hands
the orientations of the kinematical major axes for the stellar components; they are obtained with the
same DETKA software by applying it to the data from the ATLAS-3D survey (Cappellari et al. 2011)
or from the CALIFA survey (Sánchez et al. 2012, 2016). In these cases we can check independently
the circular shape of the stellar disk and the axisymmetry of the gravitational potential.
A quick look at the Fig. 8 reveals a great variety of behavior of the gas kinematical major axis in the
gas-rich lenticular galaxies. Sometimes the ionized gas lies in the galactic planes and exhibits regular
circular rotation (NGC 252, NGC 2551, NGC 4324), though the gaseous-disk plane may be warped
together with the stellar plane (NGC 252), or the gas may counterrotate the stellar rotation (NGC
2551, Sil’chenko et al. 2009). Sometimes the gas lies within the decoupled plane homogeneously
inclined to the stellar disk (NGC 2655, NGC 3619). Sometimes the central gas is in the polar plane,
but at larger radii it falls into the main galactic plane – and starts to corotate the stellar disk
(NGC 2962, NGC 4026) or to counterrotate it (NGC 7280, Fig. 6) or to form a completely detached
outer starforming ring (UGC 9519). Sometimes the central region of a galaxy (its bulge?) looks
triaxial, with a twisted isophote major axis, but the ionized gas just within the same radial range
remains to be confined to the plane of the stellar disk and demonstrates regular circular rotation
(IC 5285, UGC 12840, NGC 3106). And the last, perhaps the most interesting class of objects: those
with the ionized gas confined to the galactic planes and demonstrating laminar circular rotation, but
only within a limited radial range – NGC 774, NGC 2697, NGC 3166, NGC 3182. This latter case
will be discussed in some more details below, in Section 5.
4.3. Gas excitation and metallicities
The source of ionized-gas excitation can be determined by analyzing the flux ratios of low-ionization
and high-ionization emission lines to Balmer emission lines – at so called BPT (Baldwin-PhillipsTerlevich) diagrams (Baldwin et al. 1981; Veilleux & Osterbrock 1987). At least, starforming regions
demonstrate quite recognizable emission-line spectra; and the models allow to determine the chemical
composition – mainly oxygen abundances – by using the flux ratios of strong emission lines just for
the case of the gas excited by young stars. We have checked the gas excitation in our S0 galaxies by
studying the emission lines in the long-slit spectra obtained with the SCORPIO/BTA; for NGC 774
and NGC 3106 we have used the public spectral datacubes from the CALIFA survey (Sánchez et al.
2016), for NGC 2697 and NGC 4324 – additional spectral data obtained earlier at the 11m SALT
of the SAAO with the long-slit spectrograph RSS (Proshina et al. 2019) have been involved into our

24

present analysis. Weak and rather homogeneously distributed along the slit emission lines related
to the gaseous disks with strongly decoupled rotation – those in NGC 2655, NGC 2787, NGC 3414,
and NGC 7280, – have all demonstrated shock-like excitation: in their spectra the emission line
[NII]λ6583 is comparable or even stronger than the Hα everywhere along the slit (see 2D spectra
obtained along major axes of the mentioned galaxies in Fig. 9). Also similar pattern of
emission-line ratios is typical for diffuse ionized gas (DIG) that has allowed to explain
diffuse gas excitation in early-type galaxies by old, strongly evolved stars (Binette et al.
1994). The other galaxies demonstrate inhomogeneous clumpy emission-line distributions along
the slit (see the example of such behavior in Fig. 10), and we have measured the emission-line flux
ratios for the individual clumps. We show the BPT diagrams for these measurements in Fig. 11.
The emission from the regions lying under the theoretical ‘maximum starburst line’ from Kewley
et al. (2001) can be in principle explained through photoionization by young stars, but composite
mechanism of excitation might be responsible for the emission from the clumps lying between this
line and empirical Kauffmann et al. (2003) separating sequence. As it follows from Fig. 11, half of
the clumps in NGC 3166 and some regions in NGC 2551 clearly demonstrate dominating mechanisms
of gas excitation different from photoionization by young stars (e.g., by shocks or by old, post-AGB
stars). NGC 774 lies at the border between the HII-region-like excitation and DIG-like or shocklike excitation. All other resolved clumps lie well below the ‘maximum starburst line’, around the
Kauffmann et al. (2003) HII-fitting sequence, and their emission can be explained through pure
photoionization by young massive stars. So we can determine oxygen abundances of the gas in these
clumps by exploring strong-line methods.
In general, accurate oxygen abundances in HII regions can be ‘directly’ derived from measurements of electron temperature-sensitive line ratios, such as
[OIII]λλ4959, 5007/[OIII]λ4363. This is often referred to as the Te -method. However,
in the most cases it is impossible to measure the faint emission lines like [OIII]λ4363 in
distant galaxies. To avoid this problem many empirical and model-based calibrations
relying on strong emission lines only were developed. Despite that, the well-known
problem of discrepancy (up to 0.6 dex) of various metallicity calibrations is still not
resolved (see, e.g., Kewley & Ellison 2008). Here we have used several empirical methods to
derive oxygen abundances 12 + log(O/H), and have compared their results. Because of the limited
spectral range of our data, we selected only those methods that do not demand [OII]λλ3727, 3729
line to be observed: S-method (Pilyugin & Grebel 2016), O3N2, N2 (both from Marino et al. 2013),
and D16 (Dopita et al. 2016). Former three of these methods were calibrated using local HII regions
with well-known oxygen abundances determined through the Te -method. The fourth method, D16,
is a photoionization model-based one.
Every method used by us has its advantages and disadvantages in comparison with others. Thus, only [NII]/Hα ratio is needed for the N2 method, but it is applicable only for
8.0 < 12 + log(O/H) < 8.65, gives very large scatter (0.16 dex at 1σ level) of the yielding values, and
hence provides only rough estimate of the gas metallicity. Another popular method – O3N2 – uses
neighboring emission lines ratios, [OIII]/Hβ and [NII]/Hα, and hence almost does not suffer from uncertainties with reddening correction. This method is applicable within 8.17 < 12 + log(O/H) < 8.77,
and shows large dispersion (in average 0.18 dex, but significantly lower for 12 + log(O/H) > 8.4).
Recent studies have shown that the contamination by a large fraction of DIG affects

the results obtained with O3N2 method in only small extent (Kumari et al. 2019; Poetrodjojo et al. 2019). The S-method is well-calibrated in the range of 7.1 < 12 + log(O/H) < 8.75
and on testing sample yields the results that agree with estimations made by using the Te -method,
with a standard deviation of ∼ 0.05 dex. In its original form this method suffers from reddening
uncertainties (which are rather high in our data) because all involved emission-line fluxes ([OIII],
[SII], [NII]) should be normalized to the flux of Hβ line. Finally, the D16 method demands only
flux ratios of the lines within the red part of a spectrum – [NII]/[SII] and [NII]/Hα. This method
was developed for application to high-z galaxies, and its main advantage is that it doesn’t depend
on the ionization parameter or ISM pressure, and hence it might be used safely also for regions
having enhanced [NII]/Hα ratios (e.g., lying in the composite excitation zone at the BPT diagrams).
However note that it is still calibrated through the photoionization models that do not include
excitation by shocks. This method yields systematically higher oxygen abundances (in comparison with the Te -method) because of the higher solar abundance used as zero-point in calibration
(12 + log(O/H) = 8.77 instead of 8.69). Unfortunately, authors of the original work do not provide
an estimate of typical uncertainty for the D16 calibration.
Taking into account the problems with the metallicity calibrations used in this work, we have
applied some corrections to the results making them more comparable with each other:

• All the values of 12 + log(O/H) obtained with the D16 method were reduced by 0.08 dex to
take into account the different solar oxygen abundance values assumed;

26

Sil’chenko et al.

Figure 10. An example of the clumpy emission lines in the long-slit spectrum of NGC 2551 – the S0 galaxy
with a broad starforming ring.

• As an input for the S-method, we have used the [SII]/Hα and [NII]/Hα line flux ratios and
a proposed theoretical Balmer decrement Hα/Hβ = 2.86 (Osterbrock & Ferland 2006). This
correction allowed us to reduce significantly the final uncertainty of the oxygen abundance
because of getting rid of uncertainties with the reddening estimates.
• All the values beyond the area of applicability of the method used were considered as wrong
ones.
The results of the excitation analysis and oxygen abundance estimates are based on the observed flux ratios presented in Table 4 and are summarized in Table 5, where different columns
correspond to: name of the galaxy; projected distance of the current clump from the galactic center,
in orientation according to Fig. 6; the color excess E(B − V ) derived from the observed Balmer
decrement; electron density ne derived from the [SII]6717/6731 flux ratios (Osterbrock & Ferland
2006) assuming Te = 10000K; BP TN 2 and BP TS2 parameters – the shifts from the ‘maximum
starburst line’ at the corresponding BPT diagram; the oxygen abundance 12 + log(O/H) derived
using four methods described above. The listed uncertainties of the oxygen abundances derived do
not include systematic uncertainties of the methods, which should be added quadratically.
As it follows from Table 5, for the most of the starforming clumps all the methods yield the values
of oxygen abundance consistent with each other within their uncertainties. The strong discrepancies
are observed for the clumps in NGC 2551 and NGC 3166 demonstrating non-HII-like mechanism of
excitation (BP TS2 > 0 and/or BP TN 2 > 0) – the estimated values of oxygen abundance are not
reliable for them. High discrepancy is also observed for the only clump in NGC 774 locating in the

5. DISCUSSION

5.1. Starforming rings in the disk planes of S0 galaxies
We have checked the galaxies of our sample in the MAST Archive to see if they are detected in
the ultraviolet with the GALEX. Indeed, the most of them (12 of 18) are detected in the FUV-band
of the GALEX survey (Gil de Paz et al. 2007), and their UV-morphology looks usually ring-like.
The UV images of the sample galaxies are shown in Fig. 13. High-contrast ring-like UV structures
are clearly visible even in galaxies without rings of very recent star formation traced by the optical
emission lines (e.g. NGC 774, NGC 3619, etc.).2 The UV-rings in NGC 3619 and NGC 4324 were
reported earlier by Cortese & Hughes (2009), this in NGC 2962 – by Marino et al. (2011), and the
UV-ring in NGC 252 was earlier studied by us through long-slit spectroscopy with the SCORPIO of

The central ‘holes’ in the FPI maps of some galaxies (IC 5285, NGC 774, etc.) are caused by strong Hα absorption
line in the galactic spectra produced by underlying stellar population. We could not take this effect into account,
because the spectral range of the FPI data is too small.

detected in the most cases.

the Russian 6m telescope in the optical spectral range (Ilyina et al. 2014). The results of the gas
excitation analysis within the area of UV-bright rings have shown that the UV-bright rings in S0
galaxies have mostly emission-line spectra typical for the gas excited by young massive stars betraying
current star formation. However there are two interesting cases where we have resolved a change
of the gas excitation mechanism along the radius. In NGC 2551 at the inner northern edge of the
starforming ring series, R = 1200 − 1900 , the excitation mechanism is composite – the excitation by
young stars and by shock waves are both involved, and the electron density is increased just at this
radius. In NGC 3166 the distribution of the UV surface brightness is not symmetric with respect to
the center, it is lopsided with the most UV radiation emitted to the west from the nucleus. And the
only radial zone in NGC 3166 which demonstrates the HII-region-like emission-line spectrum is the
western distant (tidal?) arm. All other emission-line rings in NGC 3166 have shock-like or composite
gas excitation. Despite the presence of a large-scale bar in NGC 3166, we would conclude therefore
that its ring-like emission-line structures have probably the tidal or impact origin being a result of
interaction with the neighboring members of the group, NGC 3169 and NGC 3165, and of cold gas
accretion from the common HI group envelope (see below, Subsection 5.2).
We must discuss here that not only in the case of shocks, but also in a case of DIG domination
the enhanced [NII], [SII], and [OIII] lines might be observed. Among the sources considered to
be responsible for DIG excitation are the radiation of old hot pAGB stars (Sokolowsky & BlandHawthorn 1991; Binette et al. 1994), the leakage of hard photons from the star-forming regions
(Hoopes & Walterbos 2003), and the shock waves (see discussion in Zhang et al. 2017). As it was
argued by, e.g., Flores-Fajardo et al. (2011), low-mass evolved stars might be relevant sources of
the gas ionization in S0 galaxies. To consider if the possible contribution of the DIG affects our
conclusion about the presence of shocks in some regions of NGC 2551 and NGC 3166 we made
a following analysis. We identified the regions crossed by our slits that might be related to the
DIG. Various criteria of this exists in the literature: Zhang et al. (2017) proposed to use the Hα
emission-line surface luminosity as an indicator; after conversion to the observed flux per pixel,
F(Hα) < 7.4 × 10−17 erg/s/cm−2 should be considered as DIG excited by old stars. In the same
time, according to Lacerda et al. (2018), EW(Hα) < 3 Å is expected to be a more precise indicator.
In figure 12 we demonstrate the obtained radial profiles of the logarithm of the Hα line flux, EW(Hα),
and emission lines flux ratios for each galaxy. In the second panel from the top we marked those
regions showing EW(Hα) > 3 Å (and hence surely not related to old stars) by squares, while the
regions that might be considered as the DIG are shown by circles. Note that both mentioned criteria
can disagree in particular regions. Since we expect a uniform distribution of the old stars in a galaxy,
we may also expect a similar distribution of their contribution to the ionization. After excluding the
areas with EW(Hα) > 3 and the central part of the galaxies (R < 500 for NGC 2551, R < 1000 for
NGC 3166; the ionization conditions in these regions might significantly differ from the rest of the
galaxy, and it is out of scope of our analysis) we have performed a second-order robust polynomial
fitting of the flux logarithm distribution along the slit. The result is shown in the second panel
of the Fig. 12 by solid line. The same fitting was performed for every emission line analyzed; the
obtained smooth models were subtracted from the observed fluxes. After that we have compared
the emission-line flux ratios in the BPT-diagrams (bottom panel of Fig. 12) before (red color) and
after (blue color) correction for the DIG contribution. As it follows from these plots, the performed
correction changes the position in the BPT-diagrams of the points classified by us as DIG, but almost

32

Sil’chenko et al.

does not influence the flux ratios in the regions with EW(Hα) > 3 Å that were considered earlier
as shocks or star-forming rings. Hence, we may conclude that the presence of the DIG doesn’t
change our conclusions concerning the gas excitation mechanisms in the emission-line clumps. Note
however that we cannot exclude the contribution of the filtered hardened radiation from
HII regions in star-forming rings to the enhancement of [NII], [SII], and [OIII] lines.
The DIG component ionized by the filtered radiation may be more structured than one
ionized by low-mass evolved stars considered above. Hence, one may still expect that
the DIG contribution is significant in the studied clumps if there are nearby massive
star-forming regions (like it is observed in spiral galaxies, e.g., in M51, Greenawalt et
al. 1998 ). However the models of DIG ionized exclusively by filtered quanta doesn’t
fully reproduce the enhanced [OIII] emission lines (Weber et al. 2019), while at least
for NGC 3166 the ratio of [OIII]5007/Hβ is clearly high in comparison with the clumps
related to HII regions (see Figs. 11, 12). So, the ionization by shocks in the clumps
above ‘maximum starburst line’ is a preferred mechanism at least for this galaxy.
Figure 15 presents some correlations (or the absence of any correlations) related to the UV-rings;
for several galaxies (NGC 2697, NGC 2551, IC 5285) we take into account the multiple UV-rings
at various radii. The left upper plot demonstrates that the radial localization of the UV-bright
starforming rings is not casual: the radii of the rings coincide exactly with the zones where the
kinematical major axes are in agreement with the lines of nodes (Fig. 8), or where the gas exhibits
laminar circular rotation in the main planes of the stellar galactic disks. The only point which is not
close to the equality line is NGC 2962 where the outer ring is traced by our scanning Fabry-Perot
only partly due to its extreme patchiness, and the outermost radius catched by the DETKA software
is R ≈ 4000 – only two third of the ring radius. From the overall statistics we can conclude that
the necessary condition of the star formation triggering in a ring of S0 galaxy is gas concentration
strictly in the main plane of a galaxy and laminar circular rotation within this plane. The other
three plots of Fig. 15 demonstrate a surprising homogeneity of the gas metallicities within the starforming rings: they are all concentrated around the slightly subsolar value, −0.15 dex, and do
not correlate neither with the radius of the ring nor with the metallicity of the underlying stellar
population estimated here from the Lick indices measured in our long-slit spectra and confronted
to the evolutionary synthesis models from Thomas, Maraston, and Bender (2003). The metallicities
of the stellar populations are either taken from our earlier works (Ilyina et al. 2014; Proshina et al.
2019), or calculated particularly for this analysis from the spectra obtained with the SCORPIO and
SCORPIO-2; for the latter galaxies we show the index–index diagrams in Fig. 14. The details of the
stellar population analysis are analogous to our earlier works and can be inspected in Ilyina et al.
(2014). The only point with a supersolar metallicity at the Fig. 15 is a starforming ring in NGC 774
which is perhaps dominated by shock-wave excitation (see the BPT analysis above, Fig. 11) and
which gas oxygen-abundance estimate in the Table 5 may hence be unreliable.
To illustrate once more our thesis about star formation suppression by gas accretion from highly
inclined directions, we have calculated integrated star formation rates (SFRs) for our galaxies having
the integrated FUV-magnitudes in the NED, by using the calibrations from Lee et al. (2009); and
then we have compared these SFR estimates with the total gas content in the galaxies, HI+H2 ,
compiled in our Table 1. The comparison – namely, the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation for our sample
– is shown in Fig. 16. One can see that the most galaxies obey the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation with

metallicity index involving magnesium and iron lines, we solve the metallicity-age degeneracy and determine
these stellar population parameters with the SSP evolutionary synthesis models produced by Thomas et al.
(2003). Five different age sequences (red lines) are plotted as reference frame; the blue lines crossing the
model age sequences mark the metallicities of +0.67, +0.35, 0.00, –0.33 from right to left. Large black stars

also plotted for the reference frame.

the logarithmic slope of 1, and this picture is consistent both for the SFR confronting to
the total gas mass, HI+H2 , or to the H2 only. But several galaxies fall below this relation,
and these are the galaxies with large polar HI disks (see the subsection 5.3 and the Table 6) or the
galaxies where we see outer HI filaments orthogonal to the galactic planes in the HI maps by Serra
et al. (2012) (see the next subsection). These galaxies may be very gas-rich, with more than 109
solar masses of neutral hydrogen, as it is observed in NGC 2655 or UGC 9519; but their current star
formation is far less intense than we can expect from the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. Interestingly,
the star formation suppression is also detected in UGC 9519 when we consider its H2
content only. The molecular gas in UGC 9519 is confined to the central part of the

galaxy; but within this central part it is also distributed in the polar plane (Alatalo et
al. 2013)!
5.2. Accretion seen ‘by eye’: neutral hydrogen around NGC 3166, NGC 4026, and NGC 7280
NGC 3166. This galaxy is embedded into a large reservoir of HI together with NGC 3169 (to the
east from NGC 3166) and NGC 3165 (to the west from NGC 3166), see new Aresibo and GMRT 21cm observations in Lee-Waddell et al. (2012)). Outer streams and HI filaments coinciding sometimes
with the UV-bright structures revealed by the GALEX are seen to the east-south from the galaxy.
The asymmetric inner structure of NGC 3166 looks even more striking when we inspect the data
on neutral hydrogen and on the far ultraviolet surface brightness distribution within the galaxy
(Fig. 17 and Fig. 13). The HI is mostly concentrated to the east from the nucleus (and in smaller
degree in the outer western tidal arm – the only place where the ionized-gas emission-line spectrum
reveals excitation by young stars), while the far-ultraviolet radiation – to the west from the nucleus.
Moreover, the F U V − N U V color is extremely red to the east from the nucleus, which may be caused
by asymmetric dust distribution or by other, than star formation, nature of the UV radiation just
over this region. Here it is the point to mention that already Taniguchi et al. (1994) noted the
stronger horn of the CO-line at receding velocities – or to the west from the nucleus where we see
now the extended FUV signal. In the situation when the neutral hydrogen is localized in one half
of the galaxy, and the star formation (UV and Hα) – at the opposite side of the galaxy where the
molecular gas is also more prominent, we can only suggest a recent event of the gas acquisition, less
than one orbital period ago. The whole geometry of the accretion implies the cold atomic gas infall
under almost right angle into the disk to the east from the galactic center where shock gas excitation
dominates in the emission-line spectrum. Further gas re-distribution over the whole galactic disk
proceeds probably in strongly turbulent regime, because we see the gaseous disk precession near

the center (Fig. 8). The gas compression along the trajectories of orbital rotation provides current
formation of molecular clouds and current star formation to the west from the galactic center. So
the star-forming ring in NGC 3166 is still incomplete.
NGC 4026. It is another galaxy where a highly elongated HI filament which is almost perpendicular
to the galaxy plane seen edge-on is observed in the wide galaxy outskirts (Serra et al. 2012). This
time the gaseous stream penetrates NGC 4026 just near the center at the right angle. As a result, we
see nearly polar rotation of the gas traced by the [OIII]λ5007 emission line up to R ≈ 1000 (Fig. 4).
In the outer part of the galaxy, within the area dominated by the large-scale disk, the ionized gas as
well as the neutral hydrogen are confined to the galactic plane (Fig. 17) and rotate together with the
stellar component of the disk. Interestingly, despite the rather large amount of the gas in the galaxy
and its rather regular distribution and kinematics, no traces of star formation are found all over the
galaxy – no Hα emission lines, no far-ultraviolet signal.

NGC 7280. This galaxy is quite similar to NGC 4026 in all aspects but one. Lacking current star
formation and Hα emission lines in the disk spectrum, it has a circumnuclear polar disk, seen both in
the ionized-gas kinematics (Fig. 4) and in the HI distribution (Serra et al. 2012); but in the outer-disk
area the gas counterrotates the stars. NGC 7280 is not exactly edge-on, and our surface photometry
reveals some signs of triaxiality in its center (Afanasiev & Sil’chenko 2000, and see the isophote turn

in Figs. 8 and 17, right); however the outer gas rotation looks circular though in opposite sense than
that of the stars.
5.3. Extended inclined gaseous disks: neutral hydrogen around NGC 2655, NGC 2787, NGC 3414,
NGC 3619, and UGC 9519

40

Sil’chenko et al.

NGC 2655. The galaxy was mapped in HI and analyzed in detail by Sparke et al. (2008). The
outer HI distribution resembled a huge disk, with the radius exceeding the optical one by a factor
of 2, and the orientation of this disk in its outer parts was strongly different from the orientation
of the stellar disk. However, the HI velocity field obtained with a spatial resolution about of 400
(∼ 3.5 kpc) looked bisymmetrical, and Sparke et al. (2008) had constructed a model of a strongly
warped, circularly rotating gaseous disk produced probably by multiple minor mergers a few Gyr
ago. Indeed, NGC 2655 is a center of a group, and several small gas-rich galaxies are still seen not
far from it. The multiple mergers are needed because the total mass of neutral hydrogen in the
galaxy, 2 · 109 solar masses, is too large to be provided by a single satellite sinking. Our present
data revealing strong velocity anomaly close to the center, in some 1000 to the north, puts into doubt
a relaxed character of the gas distribution in the galaxy; perhaps, satellite ingestion by NGC 2655
continues just now. We see no signs of current star formation in and around NGC 2655, and this
conclusion coincides with the opinion by Sparke et al. (2008).
NGC 2787. The galaxy was mapped in the 21 cm line with the WSRT by Shostak (1987). He
reported a HI ring with a radius of 10 kpc, beyond the optical borders of the galaxy, with regular
circular rotation implying the orientation of the line of nodes of the gaseous disk plane in P A = 140◦
±5◦ . It is almost orthogonal to the inner rotation plane of the ionized gas (Fig. 8) and also strongly
different from the orientation of the stellar disk, P A0 = 108◦ . The gaseous disk isovelocity contour
twist in the central part of NGC 2787 may be explained by a strong bar aligned in P A = 160◦ ;
perhaps the gas when inflowing to the center is settling into a main plane of the triaxial potential
orthogonally to the bar major axis. But the outer neutral hydrogen strongly decoupled from the
stellar body is evidently accreted from outside though NGC 2787 is recognized as a completely
isolated S0. Again, any star formation is absent over the whole galaxy extension.
NGC 3414. An extended, regularly rotating HI disk of this peculiar S0 galaxy has been mapped
by Morganti et al. (2006). Earlier the galaxy was included into the first survey with the SAURON
and later classified as a slow rotator though S0 (Emsellem et al. 2007). In fact, the low projected
stellar rotation of NGC 3414 is not unexpected because of the disk orientation nearly face-on (Salo
et al. 2015). However, the gaseous disk extending up to R > 10000 looks much more inclined to the
sky plane, and so much faster rotating, up to Vrot,proj > 150 km s−1 (Morganti et al. 2006). The
kinematical major axis and visible elongation of the large-scale gaseous disk is P Akin,HI ≈ 140◦ (see
Fig. 17) that differs from the stellar isophote major axis, P A = 12◦ (Salo et al. 2015), and from the
thin ‘bar’ elongation in P A ∼ 20◦ . In the very center, R < 1000 , the gas rotation plane starts to
turn, and the kinematical major axis traced by the [OIII]λ5007 emission-line velocity field aligns with
the ‘bar’ (Fig. 4). In Fig. 8 we have plotted the ionized-gas kinematical major axis orientation by
fat black squares (our Fabry-Perot data) and by pale squares (SAURON [OIII]λ5007 velocity map);
both data sets consistently indicate strong turn of the kinematical major axis by ∼ 90◦ , toward
P A < 50◦ at R < 300 . This ‘polar’ velocity structure is aligned with the morphological feature in
P A ∼ 20◦ which is sometimes described as a bar and sometimes – as a polar ring (Whitmore et al.
1990). Since the stellar photometric and gas kinematical major axes coincide at R < 300 , the data
are more consistent with the hypothesis of a polar disk; however this polar disk seen strictly edge-on
lacks any gas at R > 1000 . Again, over the whole extension of the gas distribution any star formation
is absent (Shapiro et al. 2010).

Ionized gas in S0 galaxies

NGC 3619. The neutral hydrogen had been mapped in this galaxy as early as in 1989 (van Driel
et al. 1989) with the WSRT. The whole gas distribution resembled an inner ring embedded into
the optical body of the galaxy. The stellar velocity maps were obtained twice, in the frames of the
panoramic spectral surveys ATLAS-3D (Krajnovic et al. 2011) and CALIFA (Garcia-Lorenzo et al.
2015; Sánchez et al. 2016), and we have made the tilted-ring analysis of the both velocity fields. The
combined analysis of the stellar kinematics and surface brightness distributions retrieved from SDSS
and S4G (Sheth et al. 2010) surveys implies that the stellar disk of this galaxy is seen nearly face-on:
the isophote ellipticity is approximately 0.1 that gives us the inclination of 25◦ under the disk relative
thickness of 0.22 (Chudakova & Sil’chenko 2014), and the kinematical inclination provided by the
tilted-ring analysis is also < 30◦ at R > 1000 . However the visible cold gas rotation velocity in the
inner region of the galaxy measured through the interferometric mapping of CO (Alatalo et al. 2013),
HI (van Driel et al. 1989), and our Hα data, is ∼200 km s−1 resulting in kinematical inclination
estimate of about 50◦ . The line-of-nodes position angles are also different: 85◦ – 90◦ for the gas
against P A0,kin = 50◦ for the stellar component (Fig. 8 and Fig. 17). It means that the gaseous disk
in its central part is strongly inclined with respect to the stellar disk plane; the southern part of the
gaseous disk is the nearest to us because we see a red dust lane projected against the bulge at the
color g − r map (Fig. 17). Interestingly, the UV-ring at the radius of 2000 in NGC 3619 is absolutely
round that implies the gas compression strictly within the plane of the stellar disk. Perhaps, in the
outer parts of the disk the gaseous sheet falls completely into the main plane of the galaxy – see the
profiles of the left plot of Fig. 17 beyond R > 7000 .
UGC 9519. Recent deep mapping of the neutral hydrogen in UGC 9519 by Zhang et al. (2019) has
revealed multi-tiered structure of cold gas distribution in this galaxy. Zhang et al. (2019) identify
three main zones of this distribution: the center, R < 2500 , the inner ring, R = 4000 − 8000 , and the
outer ring at R ∼ 30 , or > 20 kpc! Our Fabry-Perot data obtained in two emission lines, Hα and
[NII]λ6583, trace the central zone which lacks any star formation and rotates with the line of nodes
in P A ≈ 150◦ , in polar orientation with respect to the stellar disk, and also the inner ring, up
to R ≈ 8000 , rotating in a plane with the line of nodes in P A ≈ 20◦ ; so our data are completely
consistent with the HI orientation and rotation (Fig 17). The ‘inner’ ring is detached from the main
galactic stellar body; it demonstrates the gas excitation by young stars (our long-slit data) and high
UV surface brightness (Zhang et al. 2019) so being certainly a starforming ring. Curiously, the
molecular gas is concentrated in the central part of the galaxy (Alatalo et al. 2013) where there is
no star formation; it rotates together with the ionized gas, in the polar orientation with respect to
the main galactic disk.
5.4. Long-lived inclined gaseous disks as treated by dynamics
A problem of possible steady state of inclined gaseous disks was studied more than once as a general
problem of galaxy dynamics. It was provoked partly by impressive phenomenon of large-scale polar
rings, partly by understanding inevitable (common) gas accretion from an arbitrary direction. So in
1980th-1990th this problem had been solved both analytically, for a case of a spheroidal potential –
e.g. by Steiman-Cameron & Durisen (1988), – and by numerical simulations, for a case of triaxial
tumbling potential – e.g. by Colley & Sparke (1996). It was shown that in the case of quasiaxisymmetrical potential the gas acquired under a moderate inclination – say, under 40◦ – had to
settle into a main galactic plane in several precession period, that corresponded for a medium-mass
galaxy to 1 Gyr in the center, R ∼ 1 kpc, and much longer, > 6 Gyr, at R ∼ 10 kpc (Steiman-

42

Sil’chenko et al.

Cameron & Durisen 1988). Christodoulou & Tohline (1993) considered three initial directions of
gas acquisition, from under 10◦ , 40◦ , and 80◦ to the equatorial plane, and had found significant
differences in the gas behavior: the gas acquired under 10◦ settled into the main plane after 22-25
orbital periods, the gas acquired under 40◦ settled after 11-13 orbital period, but after 8 orbital period
the disk started to suffer violent gas inflow to the center; and the gas acquired at 80◦ conserved its
orientation during the Hubble time but suffered also some radial inflow. Finally, within the triaxial
potential the gas could settle in one of two main planes – to that orthogonal to the longest axis or to
that orthogonal to the shortest axis, and the whole dynamical evolution allowed to form steady-state
polar rings/disks (Colley & Sparke 1996).
Recently Mapelli, Rampazzo, and Marino (2015) have presented the simulation of building large–
scale (about 20 kpc in diameter) rings via a minor merger between a lenticular galaxy and its gas-rich
satellite. The estimated living time of the ring structures has appeared to be less than 3 Gyr if the
rings form from prograde encounters, whereas it can reach 4–6 Gyr after counter–rotating or non–
coplanar (inclined by 45◦ or 90◦ ) interactions.
In any case, the dynamical settling of an outer gaseous disk, with a radius of ∼ 10 kpc, requires
a very long time, so for our particular galaxies described in the previous subsection we can consider
them as stationary structures, and so we can try to estimate the accretion direction by comparing
the current spatial orientation of the outer HI disk with that of the stellar disk. We have made this
attempt, and the results are given in the Table 5. The orientations of the HI disks are taken from
the papers mentioned in the previous subsection, and for NGC 3619 and UGC 9519 – from our own
analysis of the WSRT interferometric velocity fields. The orientations of the stellar disks are taken
from the photometric decomposition results of the S4G survey (Salo et al. 2015), and for UGC 9519
we have calculated the orientation parameters of the stellar rotation plane by applying the tilted-ring
technique to the public SAURON data. The last column gives the estimated angles between the
stellar and gaseous planes. For this calculation we have used the formula which is published by
Moiseev (2012). Two values are given for every galaxy because of the uncertainty with the nearest
side of any disk. Interestingly, most galaxies with the steady-state extended HI disks have a possible
variant of their nearly polar orientation with respect to the stellar disks. Only NGC 3619 has the
neutral-hydrogen disk with the certainly intermediate inclination; it is the smallest of all, and it
contains an inner starforming ring. Perhaps, we could also note some additional consequences of the
gas inflow through the inclined gaseous disks: in the galaxies with the large bars, NGC 2787 and
perhaps UGC 9519, the central gas has settled into the planes orthogonal to the long axes of their
bars.
6. SUMMARY

We have presented the results of our spectral study of gaseous disks in 18 S0 galaxies undertaken with the facilities of the Russian 6m telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory; both
panoramic spectroscopy with the scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer and long-slit spectroscopy over
wide spectral range with SCORPIO have been used. The gas in S0s is commonly accreted from outside that is implied by its decoupled kinematics: at least 5 galaxies demonstrate extended, strongly
inclined HI disks smoothly coupled with an inner ionized-gas component, in 3 galaxies we see HI
accretion directly, as thin filaments coming into the galactic disks under right angle; 7 galaxies reveal
circumnuclear polar ionized-gas rotation, and in NGC 2551 the ionized gas – and neutral hydrogen
too (Tang et al. 2008) – though confined to the main galactic plane however counterrotates the stel-

lar component. The ionized-gas excitation analysis at the BPT-diagrams reveals the gas ionization
by young massive stars in 12 of 18 S0 galaxies studied by us; the current star formation in these
galaxies is confined to the ring-like zones coinciding with the UV-rings seen at the galaxy images
provided by the GALEX survey. The UV-ring in NGC 774 though suffering current star formation
(a SNII is detected recently in this galaxy) reveals the gas excitation mostly dominated by shock
waves. We have applied the tilted-ring analysis to the 2D velocity fields of the ionized gas (and also
of the neutral hydrogen in some objects). Tracing the orientation of the gas rotation-plane lines
of nodes along the radius, we have found that current star formation proceeds usually at the radii
where the gas lies in the stellar disk planes and rotates circularly; the sense of the gas rotation does
not matter (NGC 2551 forms stars!). In the galaxies without current star formation the extended
gaseous disks are either in a steady-state quasi-polar orientation (NGC 2655, NGC 2787, NGC 3414),
or are acquired just now through the infalling highly inclined external filaments provoking probably
shock-wave excitation (NGC 4026, NGC 7280). Our data implies perhaps crucial difference of the
external gas accretion regime in S0s with respect to spiral galaxies: the geometry of the gas accretion
in S0s is typically off-plane.
This work is based on the spectral data obtained at the Russian 6m telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory carried out under the financial support of the Ministry of Science and Higher
Education of the Russian Federation. We are grateful to the staff of the Special Astrophysical Observatory and especially to Victor Afanasiev for his great contribution into spectroscopy development
