Abstract
We investigate the noncommutative gauge theories arising on the worldvolumes of D-branes in
non-geometric backgrounds obtained by T-duality from twisted tori. We revisit the low-energy
effective description of D-branes on three-dimensional T-folds, examining both cases of parabolic
and elliptic twists in detail. We give a detailed description of the decoupling limits and explore
various physical consequences of the open string non-geometry. The T-duality monodromies
of the non-geometric backgrounds lead to Morita duality monodromies of the noncommutative
Yang–Mills theories induced on the D-branes. While the parabolic twists recover the wellknown examples of noncommutative principal torus bundles from topological T-duality, the
elliptic twists give new examples of noncommutative fibrations with non-geometric torus fibres.
We extend these considerations to D-branes in backgrounds with R-flux, using the doubled
geometry formulation, finding that both the non-geometric background and the D-brane gauge
theory necessarily have explicit dependence on the dual coordinates, and so have no conventional
formulation in spacetime.

Introduction and summary

One of the most striking features of T-duality, which relates different string backgrounds describing
the same physics, is that it leads to the possibility of non-geometric backgrounds which do not
have a description in terms of conventional Riemannian geometry [1] (see e.g. [2–4] for reviews and
further references). Some non-geometric backgrounds arise as T-duals of conventional geometric
backgrounds, while others are not geometric in any duality frame. Typical examples start with
geometric spaces which admit a torus fibration, with transition functions that are diffeomorphisms
of the torus fibres and shifts of the B-field. T-duality transformations along the torus fibres (using
the standard Buscher rules [5,6] on a covering space) in general lead to T-folds [1]. These are locally
geometric – locally they look like a product of the torus with a patch of the base – but the transition
functions in general involve T-duality transformations on the torus fibres. The Buscher rules give
T-duality in isometric directions. For non-isometric directions, there is a notion of generalised
T-duality that can be applied [7]. For a circular direction in which the fields depend explicitly
on the coordinate x of that circle, a generalised T-duality transforms this to a configuration in
which the fields depend on the coordinate x
e of the T-dual circle. This x
e-dependence means that it
cannot be viewed as a conventional background even locally, but has intrinsic dependence on the
T-dual coordinates, so a doubled geometry formulation is essential. This concept of generalised
T-duality has been checked in asymmetric orbifold limits [7], and is in agreement with the concept
1

of generalised T-duality arising in double field theory [8–10]. We will refer to configurations in which
fields and/or transition functions have explicit dependence on the dual coordinates x
e as essentially
doubled.

In this paper we will consider n-dimensional backgrounds obtained by T-dualising the simplest
examples of torus bundles, which are fibrations of n − 1-dimensional tori T n−1 over a circle S 1 with
vanishing B-field, sometimes referred to as twisted tori [7,11–15].1 The monodromy around the base
circle is a diffeomorphism of the torus fibres, in the mapping class group SL(n − 1, Z). These and
their T-duals give compactifications with a duality twist [11], which are stringy generalisations of
Scherk–Schwarz reductions [13]. For definiteness, we will focus on the case of backgrounds in n = 3
dimensions, where all of our considerations can be made explicit. Then the simplest case is that of
a parabolic monodromy, acting as an integer shift τ 7→ τ + m of the complex structure modulus τ
of the two-torus T 2 . In this case, the torus bundle is the nilfold of degree m, which is T-dual to
a geometric three-torus T 3 with H-flux of the B-field proportional to m [13]. Applying T-duality
transformations then results in a much-studied chain of transformations between geometric and
non-geometric backgrounds [7, 11, 12, 14, 15]. This is conventionally depicted in a schematic form
as [14]
T

k
Hijk ←→

(1.1)

where Ti denotes a T-duality transformation along the i-th coordinate direction. Successive Tdualities take the three-torus with H-flux to a nilfold with what is sometimes called “geometric
flux” f , then to a T-fold with “Q-flux”, and finally a generalised T-duality takes this to an essentially
doubled space with “R-flux”. The cases with f -, H- and Q-flux can be thought of as T 2 conformal
field theories fibred over a circle coordinate x, with monodromy in the T-duality group O(2, 2; Z),
while the case with R-flux is an essentially doubled space which is a fibration over the T-dual circle
with dual coordinate x
e and monodromy in the T-duality group. For more general monodromies,
such as the elliptic monodromies that we consider in detail below, the results are rather different
and do not follow the pattern suggested by (1.1). As we shall see for the elliptic case, acting on the
twisted torus ‘with f -flux’ with either Ti or Tj gives a T-fold, and no dual with only H-flux arises.
A further T-duality then gives an essentially doubled space.
A useful perspective for understanding non-geometry in string theory is to study D-branes in these
backgrounds. D-branes can be used as probes to analyse the geometry of a string background and
to provide an alternative definition of the background geometry in terms of the moduli space of
the probe. D-branes in non-geometric backgrounds were previously discussed from the point of
view of doubled (twisted) torus geometry in [1, 18–20], directly in string theory from a target space
perspective in [21–23], and from open string worldsheet theory in [24, 25].
In the present paper we focus on an approach based on effective field theory, reinterpreting all of
the T-duality transformations in the chain (1.1) for the nilfold and the corresponding chains for
other backgrounds in terms of open strings. In this setting it is important to define a low-energy
scaling limit which decouples the deformations of geometry due to non-locality of strings from
the “genuine” non-geometry due to background fields. In the case of D-branes in flat space with a
constant B-field background, the D-brane worldvolume theory is a noncommutative supersymmetric
Yang–Mills theory [26], and the decoupling limit was carefully set out in [27]; these considerations
were extended to the case of D-branes in curved backgrounds with non-constant B-fields and nonzero H-flux in [28, 29] (see e.g. [30–32] for reviews and further references). This limit is often
neglected in the literature on embeddings of worldvolume noncommutative gauge theories in string
theory.

Closely related non-geometric backgrounds involving torus bundles with T-duality monodromy around singular
fibres were discussed in [16, 17].

To this end, we revisit the problem of formulating effective noncommutative Yang–Mills theories on
D-branes in non-geometric tori in the decoupling limit, extending the earlier work of [22, 23] (see
also [21]) in various directions. In these works, D3-branes in the simplest T-fold background, originating via T-duality from a flat three-torus with H-flux, are shown to have an effective description
as a noncommutative gauge theory on a flat torus. The non-geometry of the background is then
interpreted as the dependence of the noncommutativity parameter on the base coordinate x ∈ S 1
of the original torus fibration, with a monodromy around the circle that is a Morita transformation.
Morita equivalence was understood in [27] as the open string version of T-duality in the decoupling
limit, which is a symmetry of the noncommutative Yang–Mills theory.
In the following we will re-examine D-branes on non-geometric spaces in a more general setting,
allowing for more general monodromies beyond the parabolic ones. The elliptic monodromies are
of particular interest as they give string theory backgrounds directly, without the need to fibre
over some base space [11]. For the particular case of the Z4 elliptic monodromy, we find that the
low-energy effective field theory is defined on a non-geometric torus and that all of its moduli,
including the noncommutativity parameter and the Yang–Mills coupling, have a monodromy in the
base circle coordinate x in such a way as to render the supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory invariant
under Morita duality. To the best of our knowledge, such an example of a noncommutative fibration
with non-geometric torus fibres has not appeared before in the literature. The monodromy also
interchanges D0-brane and D2-brane charges, which swaps the roles of the rank of the gauge fields
and their topological charge in the worldvolume gauge theory.
We also study the effective noncommutative gauge theories in essentially doubled spaces using the
doubled twisted torus formalism of [33–36], in which D-branes have been classified in [19]. Here we
find a dependence of the noncommutative gauge theory on the dual base coordinate x
e ∈ S 1 , thus
further exemplifying the need of the doubled formalism in describing such configurations, another
point of emphasis which is sometimes neglected in the literature. The general picture of the effective
theories on D-branes in non-geometric polarisations of the doubled twisted torus geometry is then
that of a parameterised family of noncommutative Yang–Mills theories with monodromies in x or x
e
that are Morita transformations. These arise as decoupling limits of backgrounds with monodromies
in x or x
e that are T-duality transformations.
An important feature of our considerations is the role of the doubled geometry. For simple backgrounds, there is a conventional geometry which is seen by particles or momentum modes, while
string winding modes will see a T-dual geometry. However, in more complicated settings there is
a doubled geometry which cannot be disentangled to give a separate geometry and dual geometry,
and the momentum and winding modes see different aspects of the full doubled geometry. For a
T-fold, there is a local split, referred to as a polarisation in [1], and local coordinates in a patch
can be split into spacetime coordinates and dual coordinates. However, globally this is not possible
for a T-fold as the T-duality transition functions mix the two kinds of coordinates so that there is
no global polarisation. For essentially doubled spaces, the dependence of the background on the
coordinate conjugate to the winding number means that a conventional undoubled formulation is
not possible even locally. Configurations that are related to each other by T-dualities all arise as
different polarisations of the same doubled geometry. For example, the four configurations in the
duality chain (1.1) all arise as different polarisations of the same six-dimensional doubled space [35].
T-duality can be viewed as changing the polarisation [1].

A polarisation splits the doubled coordinates XM into “spacetime coordinates” xm and dual coordinates x
em . For a conventional configuration, the background fields include the closed string metric
g, the two-form B-field, and the dilaton φ. These background fields depend only on xm and one
obtains the usual spacetime interpretation, at least locally. For an essentially doubled configuration,
some of the fields depend explicitly on the dual coordinates x
em . For a conventional configuration
∂
with explicit dependence on a coordinate xι , a generalised T-duality along the vector field ∂ι = ∂x
ι
3

will change the dependence of the fields on xι to dependence of the fields on the dual coordinate x
eι ,
resulting in an essentially doubled background.

The doubled geometry formulation of D-branes has some interesting features [1]. Consider a Dpbrane wrapped on an n-torus T n with coordinates xm , where m = 1, . . . , n and p ≤ n. Then the
ends of open strings will have p coordinates xiD satisfying Dirichlet boundary conditions on T n
and n − p coordinates xaN satisfying Neumann boundary conditions. The doubled space is a torus
T 2n with coordinates xm , x
em , with m = 1, . . . , n. As T-duality interchanges Dirichlet and Neumann
boundary conditions, the coordinates dual to xiD are p coordinates x
eN i satisfying Neumann boundary
conditions and the coordinates dual to xaN are n − p coordinates x
eD a with Dirichlet boundary
conditions. Then in the doubled torus there are precisely n Dirichlet coordinates xiD , x
eD a , so that
whatever the value of p, the doubled picture is that of a Dn-brane wrapping a maximally isotropic
(Lagrangian) n-cycle in T 2n . As a result, a Dp-brane is secretly a Dn-brane in the doubled space.
The polarisation determines the subset of the n Dirichlet directions which are regarded as physical,
and changing the polarisation changes this subset: a T-duality that changes the polarisation from
one with p Dirichlet physical coordinates to one with q Dirichlet physical coordinates is interpreted
as taking a Dp-brane to a Dq-brane. This picture was developed and extended to more general
doubled spaces in [18, 19].
The effective worldvolume theory on a D-brane is a noncommutative Yang–Mills theory coupling to
a background open string metric GD with noncommutativity bivector θ and gauge coupling gYM . In
general the background fields (GD , θ) as well as the coupling gYM can depend on the coordinates xm .
The action of T-duality on the closed string background (g, B, φ) gives rise to Morita transformations
of (GD , θ, gYM ), as we will review in §2, and in our considerations of D-branes on non-geometric
backgrounds we find open string analogues of T-folds in which the dependence (GD (x), θ(x), gYM (x))
on a circle coordinate x can have a monodromy that is a Morita transformation. Surprisingly, we also
find open string analogues of essentially doubled backgrounds in which (GD , θ, gYM ) have explicit
dependence on a doubled coordinate x
e, possibly with a Morita monodromy. This suggests that the
effective field theory should be defined on the full Dn-brane in the doubled space, and so the fields
can depend on all n Dirichlet coordinates xiD , x
eD a .
One of the complications in the case of the flat three-torus with H-flux and its T-duals is that
they do not define worldsheet conformal field theories, and so are not solutions of string theory.
However, there are string solutions in which these appear as fibres. The simplest case is that in
which these are fibred over a line. Taking an NS5-brane with transverse space R × T 3 and smearing
over the T 3 gives a domain wall solution which is the product of six-dimensional Minkowski space
with R × T 3 , where there is constant H-flux over T 3 and the remaining fields depend explicitly on
the coordinate of the transverse space R [13]. T-duality then takes this to a metric on the product of
R with the nilfold [13,21,22,37,38] that is hyperkähler, as was to be expected from the requirement
that the background is supersymmetric. Then further T-dualities in the chain (1.1) give T-folds
and essentially doubled spaces fibred over a line; the proper incorporation of such spaces in string
theory will be discussed further in [39]. This leads to complications in the analysis of D-branes and
decoupling limits in such backgrounds [22].

Due to the difficulties arising from such fibrations over a line or other space, we will be particularly
interested in examples that do give string theory solutions directly without the need for introducing
a fibration. For the cases with elliptic monodromy, at special points in the moduli space the
background reduces to an orbifold defining a conformal field theory and so provides a consistent
string background. However, we will also be interested in the elliptic monodromy case at general
points in the moduli space; these can arise as fibres in which the moduli vary over a line or a
higher-dimensional base space.
From the effective field theory point of view, the duality twisted reduction from ten dimensions gives
4

a Scherk–Schwarz reduction of ten-dimensional supergravity to a seven-dimensional gauged supergravity. The fact that in general the product of the internal twisted torus with seven-dimensional
Minkowski space does not define a conformal field theory, and so is not a supergravity solution, is
reflected in the fact that the seven-dimensional supergravity has a scalar potential. In the parabolic
monodromy case, the scalar potential has no critical points and so there are no Minkowski vacua,
but there are domain wall solutions which lift to the ten-dimensional geometry given by the twisted
torus fibred over a line. In the elliptic monodromy case, there is a minimum of the potential corresponding to the orbifold compactification to seven dimensions [11], but again there are more general
domain wall solutions in which the moduli vary over a line.
We will also consider the dilaton in what follows. For a given background, T-duality will change
the dilaton according to the Buscher rules. Defining a conformal field theory requires the metric,
B-field and dilaton to satisfy the beta-function equations, but it will be useful to consider general
configurations of metric, B-field and dilaton without necessarily requiring them to satisfy the betafunction equations – they then define more general compactifications, as outlined above.
One of our motivations for revisiting these field theory perspectives is to shed some light on the
relevance of the noncommutative and nonassociative deformations of closed string geometry which
were recently purported to occur in certain non-geometric backgrounds [40–44] (see e.g. [45] for a
review and further references). In contrast to these analyses, here we work in a controlled setting
with (doubled) twisted tori and quantised fluxes, without any linear approximations and with an
exact effective field theory description of the string geometry. Noncommutative and nonassociative
geometries were suggested as global (algebraic) descriptions of T-fold and R-flux non-geometries respectively in the mathematical framework of topological T-duality in [46–49], which strictly speaking
only applies to the worldvolumes of D-branes, but it was further suggested that such a description
should also apply to the closed string background itself. Such a suggestion requires further clarification, insofar that in closed string theory itself there is no immediate evidence for such nonassociative structures. While we reproduce and generalise the noncommutative geometries on D-branes
in parabolic T-fold backgrounds, which were shown by [22, 23] to agree with the expectations from
topological T-duality, we do not directly find a nonassociative geometry on D-branes in R-folds.
Instead, we find that the decoupled noncommutative gauge theory on the D-branes depends explicitly on the transverse doubled coordinate x
e, and so is essentially doubled and it appears that these
cannot be fully understood in an undoubled space.

The organisation of the paper is as follows. In §2 we briefly review, following [27], the well-known
description of the low-energy effective dynamics of D-branes in constant B-fields in terms of noncommutative gauge theory, and in particular its Morita duality on a torus which is inherited from
the T-duality symmetry of the closed string background. In §3 we briefly review some general
aspects of string theory compactifications on twisted tori, which are subsequently used to study
the worldvolume gauge theories on D-branes on three-dimensional T-folds via T-duality. We treat
the cases of parabolic monodromies in §4 and of elliptic monodromies in §5. We demonstrate, in
both cases of parabolic and Z4 elliptic twists, that there exist well-defined low-energy scaling limits
which completely decouple the open strings from closed strings, and wherein the non-geometry of
the T-fold background is manifested in the open string sector as a parameterised family of noncommutative gauge theories which are identified under Morita dualities determined by the particular
type of monodromy around x ∈ S 1 . We give a physical interpretation of the scaling limit which reproduces the mathematical description of the field of noncommutative tori probed by the D-branes,
and of the Morita equivalence bimodules which implement the Morita duality monodromies. In
the case of the elliptic monodromy we examine the theory at the orbifold fixed point where we
find that it is equivalent to an ordinary commutative gauge theory on a flat torus for finite area
and string slope α′ . In §6 we review the doubled twisted torus formalism and the classification of
D-branes therein. This setting allows us to take the final T-duality transformation that describes
5

D-branes in essentially doubled spaces, whose decoupled worldvolume gauge theory is studied in §7
where we find that in this case the D-branes really probe a noncommutative doubled geometry.
For convenience, in Appendix A we summarise the Buscher T-duality rules including dimensionful
factors.

Open string dynamics in B-fields

Consider the standard sigma-model for the embedding of an open string worldsheet Σ into a flat
target space with constant metric g, two-form gauge field B and dilaton φ. We impose boundary
conditions by requiring that the boundary ∂Σ is mapped to a submanifold W of spacetime, which is
the worldvolume of a D-brane. At tree-level in open string perturbation theory, Σ is a disk, which
can be mapped to the upper complex half-plane by a conformal transformation. The boundary of
the upper half-plane with coordinate t ∈ R is then mapped to a curve xi (t) which is the worldline
of the end of the string in the D-brane worldvolume W. We are interested in the dynamics of the
open string ends located on the D-brane. The two-point function of the xi on the boundary of the
upper complex half-plane is given by [27]
xi (t) xj (t′ ) = −α′ Gij log(t − t′ )2 +

which is equivalent to
G = g − (2π α′ )2 B g−1 B ,
Θ = −(2π α′ )2 (g + 2π α′ B)−1 B (g − 2π α′ B)−1 .

(2.3)

Of particular interest is the second term in the open string propagator (2.1), which depends only
on the ordering of the insertion points of open strings on the boundary of the disk and hence leads
to a well-defined target space quantity, independent of the worldsheet coordinates.
In [27] it was shown that there is a consistent decoupling limit where the string slope and closed
string metric scale as α′ = O(ǫ1/2 ) and gij = O(ǫ), with ǫ → 0, which decouples the open and closed
string modes on the D-brane, and in which the bulk closed string geometry degenerates to a point.
In this limit the first contribution to the propagator (2.1) vanishes, while the open string metric
and bivector are finite and are given by
GD = −(2π α′ )2 B g−1 B ,
θ = B −1 .

(2.4)

is described by noncommutative Yang–Mills theory on W. The effective Yang–Mills coupling in
the case of a Dp-brane gauge theory can be determined from the Dirac–Born–Infeld action and is
generally given by [27]

where gs is the string coupling. This is finite in the decoupling limit above if gs e φ = O(ǫ(3−p+r)/4 ),
where r is the rank of the antisymmetric matrix B. These considerations can be extended to curved
backgrounds with non-constant B-field, including those with non-vanishing H-flux H = dB [28,29],
in which case the Moyal–Weyl star-product (2.5) is replaced by the more general Kontsevich starproduct.
This story becomes particularly interesting in the case when Dp-branes wrap a p-dimensional torus
W = T p . In this case, T-duality of the closed string background translates into open string Tduality which acts on the D-brane charges. The T-duality group O(p, p; Z) acts on the closed string

(2.9)

The remarkable feature is that the noncommutative gauge theory on the Dp-brane inherits this
T-duality symmetry. The transformation of the bivector θ on its own is known from topological Tduality to define a Morita equivalence between the corresponding noncommutative tori Tθp and T ep ,
θ
which mathematically preserves their K-theory groups, or more physically the spectrum of D-brane
charges on Tθp and T ep . Thus open string T-duality in the decoupling limit is a refinement of Morita
θ
equivalence, which is referred to as Morita duality of noncommutative gauge theory.
In the mapping of T-duality of the closed string background to Morita equivalence of noncommutative Yang–Mills theory with gauge group U (n), it is generally necessary to introduce a closed
two-form [27, 50, 51]
Φ=

2n

(2.10)

on the D-brane worldvolume, which can be thought of as an abelian background ’t Hooft magnetic
flux, where Qij ∈ Z are the Chern numbers of a U (n)-bundle over T p of constant curvature. The
action is then constructed from a shifted form of the noncommutative field strength tensor
F = F⋆ + Φ 1n .
7

(2.11)

The dependence on Φ simply serves to shift the classical vacuum of the noncommutative gauge
theory, giving the fields twisted periodic boundary conditions around the cycles of T p . Under
T-duality, it is required to transform as
e = (c θ + d) Φ (c θ + d)⊤ + c (c θ + d)⊤ .
Φ

(2.12)

For example, if the components of the noncommutativity bivector θ are rational-valued, then this
can be used to provide a Morita equivalence beween noncommutative Yang–Mills theory with
periodic gauge fields and ordinary Yang–Mills theory with gauge fields having monodromies in
Zn ⊂ U (n) [51]. The inclusion of Φ also enables one to follow the T-duality orbits of the charges
of D-branes wrapping non-contractible cycles of even codimension in the Dp-brane worldvolume,
realised as topological charges in the noncommutative gauge theory, which can be suitably arranged
into vectors of SO(p, p; Z) [27, 50].
One purpose of this paper is to investigate this duality in the cases of twisted tori and the nongeometric backgrounds resulting from these under closed string T-duality.

Compactification on the twisted torus

In the duality-twisted dimensional reductions of string theory on an n-dimensional twisted torus
that we consider here, one first compactifies on an n − 1-torus T d , with d = n − 1. The theory on
this internal space is then the conformal field theory with target space T d , specified by a choice of
modulus taking values in the coset space O(d, d)/O(d) × O(d), which can be represented by a choice
of metric g and B-field on the torus T d . The group O(d, d) then acts naturally on the combination
E = α1′ (g + 2π α′ B) through fractional linear transformations. The automorphism group of the
T d conformal field theory is the subgroup O(d, d; Z), which is the T-duality group symmetry of the
compactified string theory. Configurations related by an O(d, d; Z) transformation are physically
equivalent, and so the moduli space O(d, d)/O(d) × O(d) should be identified under the action of
O(d, d; Z).
The next step is to compactify on a further circle S 1 and allow the modulus E of the T d conformal
field theory to depend on the point x ∈ S 1 . The x-dependence of E(x) is determined by a map
γ : S 1 → O(d, d) given by
γ(x) = exp(x M ) ,

(3.1)

for a (dimensionless) mass matrix M in the Lie algebra of O(d, d). This map has monodromy
M(γ) = γ(0) γ −1 (1) = exp(M ) .

(3.2)

For a consistent string theory background, this monodromy is required to be a symmetry of string
theory, and so it must lie in the T-duality group O(d, d; Z) [11,13]. The condition that this imposes
on the mass matrix M can be thought of as a “non-linear quantisation condition”.
The map γ is a local section of a principal bundle over S 1 with monodromy M(γ). The moduli
of the theory depend on the coordinate x through this section, giving a parameterised family of
conformal field theories over S 1 with moduli E(x), so that after a periodic shift x 7→ x + 1 around
the base S 1 , the conformal field theory returns to itself up to the monodromy M(γ), which is an
automorphism of the T d conformal field theory. Two such bundles are isomorphic, and hence define
equivalent theories, if their monodromies lie in the same O(d, d; Z) conjugacy class.
Suppose that the monodromy M(γ) takes values in the geometric subgroup GL(d, Z) of the duality
group consisting of large diffeomorphisms of the torus T d . In this case we take γ(x) in GL(d, R) ⊂
8

O(d, d), and represent γ(x), M and M by d × d matrices. Then compactifying on T d , followed
by compactification on S 1 with the duality twist M(γ) amounts to compactification on a torus
bundle X over a circle S 1 , often referred to as a twisted torus. We denote the local coordinates on
this fibration by (x, y 1 , . . . , y d ), where x ∈ [0, 1) is the coordinate on the base S 1 of radius r and
(y 1 , . . . , y d ) ∈ [0, 1)d are coordinates on the fibres T d . The metric is given by
ds2X = (2π r dx)2 + h(τ )ab dy a dy b ,

(3.3)

where h(τ ) is the metric on the d-torus, which depends on moduli τ taking values in the coset space
GL(d, R)/SO(d). The x-dependence of τ is defined by

(3.4)
h τ (x) ab = h(τ ◦ )cd γ(x)c a γ(x)d b

for some fixed modulus τ ◦ .

To determine the homologically stable cycles in X which can be wrapped by D-branes, it will prove
useful to have another description of these backgrounds. The twisted torus can also be described
as the quotient GZ \ GR of an n-dimensional non-compact Lie group GR by a cocompact discrete
subgroup GZ , so that much of the local structure of the theory is the same as that for the reduction
on the group manifold GR . In particular, the left-invariant Maurer–Cartan forms and the generators
of the right action of GR are well-defined on the compact space GZ \ GR .
The generators J1 , . . . , Jd , Jx of the Lie algebra of GR then have brackets
[Ja , Jx ] = Ma b Jb
where M = (Ma b ) is the d × d mass matrix
as a group of n × n matrices

SL(2, Z) monodromies

In this paper we will study the examples with n = 3 (d = 2) in detail. In this case the T-duality
group of the string theory compactified on T 2 can be factored as


O(2, 2; Z) ≃ SL(2, Z)τ × SL(2, Z)ρ ⋊ Z2 × Z2 .
(3.13)

The first SL(2, Z) factor is the mapping class group of T 2 which acts geometrically by fractional
linear transformations on the complex structure modulus τ of T 2 , while the second acts on the
complexified Kähler modulus ρ whose imaginary part is the area of T 2 and whose real part is the
restriction of the two-form B-field to T 2 . The Z2 × Z2 factor can be taken to be generated by a
reflection in one direction and a T-duality in one direction.
A further compactification on S 1 with the duality twist M(γ) in the geometric subgroup SL(2, Z)τ
is equivalent to compactification on a T 2 -bundle X over S 1 with monodromy M(γ). The constant
metric h(τ )ab on the T 2 fibers can be written in terms of the complex structure modulus τ = τ1 + i τ2
and the constant area modulus A of the torus as

(3.17)

In the following we will describe D-branes in non-geometric backgrounds associated with these
twisted three-tori. For this, we wrap Dp-branes around suitable p-cycles of X for p = 1, 2, which
become D(p + 1)-branes after T-duality to a T-fold background characterised by a monodromy
M in a non-geometric subgroup of the duality group O(2, 2; Z). We will study the corresponding
noncommutative gauge theory on the D(p + 1)-branes induced by the metric, B-field and dilaton
of the T-fold background, in a scaling limit which decouples open and closed string modes. We
shall generally find embeddings into non-geometric string theory of noncommutative Yang–Mills
theory whose worldvolume geometry and noncommutativity parameter vary over the base coordinate of a non-geometric “bundle”, and hence determine a parameterised family of noncommutative
gauge theories which is globally well-defined up to Morita equivalence, the open string avatar of
T-duality.
As conjugate monodromies define equivalent backgrounds X, the monodromies leading to physically distinct configurations are classified by SL(2, Z) conjugacy classes [11]. Following [7,11,52], the
conjugacy classes can be classified into three sets: parabolic (|Tr(M)| = 2), elliptic (|Tr(M)| < 2)
and hyperbolic (|Tr(M)| > 2). In this paper we will concentrate on the examples of parabolic
monodromies which generate integer translations τ 7→ τ + m of the modular parameter τ , and the
Z4 elliptic monodromies which generate the inversion τ 7→ − τ1 . These examples capture many of
the essential features of the noncommutative gauge theories on D-branes in non-geometric backgrounds.

D3-branes on T-folds: Parabolic monodromies

over T 2 of degree m, with fibre coordinate y 1 and base coordinates (x, y 2 ), while ω is a connection
on this bundle with Chern number m. The B-field vanishes and the dilaton is constant in this
background.
In this case GR is the three-dimensional Heisenberg group whose generators satisfy the Heisenberg
algebra
[J1 , Jx ] = m J2

and

[J1 , J2 ] = 0 = [Jx , J2 ] .

(4.5)

ζ x = dx ,

ζ 1 = dy 1 + m x dy 2

and

ζ 2 = dy 2 .

(4.7)

The Maurer–Cartan equations
dζ x = 0 = dζ 2

and

dζ 1 = m ζ x ∧ ζ 2

(4.8)

imply that H 1 (X, R) = R ⊕ R is generated by ζ x and ζ 2 . By Poincaré duality, the second homology
H2 (X, Z) = Z ⊕ Z is generated by the two-cycles ξx,1 and ξ1,2 dual to ζ x ∧ ζ 1 and ζ 1 ∧ ζ 2 , and in
particular the two-cycle ξx,2 dual to ζ x ∧ ζ 2 is homologically trivial [18]. On the other hand, from
the Gysin sequence for X viewed as a circle bundle it follows that H1 (X, Z) = Z ⊕ Z ⊕ Zm , where
the Z-valued classes are the one-cycles ξx and ξ2 dual to ζ x and ζ 2 on the T 2 base, while the Zm
torsion one-cycle ξ1 is the class of the y 1 circle fiber.

giving a shift in BT 3 by m dy 1 ∧ dy 2 , which represents an integral cohomology class.

4.1

Worldvolume geometry

Let us now wrap a D2-brane around the non-trivial two-cycle ξx,1 . T-duality in the y 1 -direction then
maps the D2-brane to a D1-brane wrapped around the one-cycle dual to ζ x in the flat three-torus
T 3 with metric and B-field given by (4.9), and constant H-flux (4.10). These are both allowed
D-brane configurations, according to the doubled torus analysis of [18].
On the other hand, we can consider T-duality along the abelian (covering space) isometry generated
by the vector field ∂y∂ 2 which maps the D2-brane to a D3-brane filling the T-fold. The metric and
B-field are given by

Noncommutative Yang–Mills theory

In order to get a low-energy limit with pure gauge theory on WD3 in which the massive string
modes are decoupled and gravity is non-dynamical, we need to take the zero slope limit α′ → 0
while keeping G and Θ fixed, which in the present case means keeping the parameters

ǫ → 0, and with all other parameters, including the B-field, held fixed. In this limit the closed
string metric from (4.12) degenerates along T 2 , taking the area to zero while fixing B, whereas the

Since ∂y∂ a θ = 0, the supersymmetric noncommutative Yang–Mills theory on the D3-brane is defined by multiplying fields f, g on S 1 × T 2 together with the Kontsevich star-product [21] (see
also [53])

algebra
[y 1 , y 2 ]⋆ = i θ(x)

[y 1 , x]⋆ = 0 = [y 2 , x]⋆ .

and

(4.25)

2 , which means geometFor fixed x ∈ S 1 the star-product (4.24) defines a noncommutative torus Tθ(x)
rically that varying x ∈ S 1 determines a field of noncommutative tori in the D3-brane worldvolume
WD3 [46, 53].

The noncommutative torus Tθ(x)

SO(2, 2; Z) ≃ SL(2, Z)θ × SL(2, Z)τ /Z2 .

(4.26)

(The Z2 factor is generated by (−1, −1) ∈ SL(2, Z) × SL(2, Z).) Morita transformations in this
group leave invariant the noncommutative gauge theory on the D3-brane filling the T-fold compactification. Here the roles of the two SL(2, Z) factors in the original duality group (3.13) are
interchanged: The SL(2, Z)ρ factor in (3.13) now acts on the D3-brane torus with (4.20) as the
geometric action of the mapping class group SL(2, Z)τ of the T 2 ‘fibres’ with coordinates (y 1 , y 2 ),
leaving θ, the Yang–Mills coupling gYM and the area V = 4π 2 r1 r2 of the torus T 2 with the metric
ds2D3 unchanged, while the SL(2, Z)τ factor in (3.13) now acts as the SL(2, Z)θ Morita transformations
M[V ] = V (c θ + d)2 ,
M[θ] =

aθ + b
,
cθ + d

M[gYM ] = gYM |c θ + d|1/2 .

(4.27)

This is the old statement [27] that Morita equivalence is precisely the structure inherited from
T-duality in the decoupling limit.
Thus by wrapping a D3-brane we gain an alternative perspective on the non-geometric nature of
the T-fold background in terms of noncommutative gauge theory: under a monodromy around the
circle coordinate x, the noncommutativity parameter transforms as θ(x + 1) = θ(x) + m, which is
precisely an SL(2, Z)θ Morita transformation by the pertinent monodromy matrix (4.1)


θ(x + 1) = M θ(x) .
(4.28)

The identification of monodromies in x via T-duality in the closed string sector is realised in the
open string sector via Morita equivalence in Yang–Mills theory on a noncommutative torus. Under
the parabolic monodromy, all other parameters of the gauge theory, including the open string metric
ds2D3 , the area V and the Yang–Mills coupling constant gYM , are invariant.

To summarise, in the case of parabolic twists we have found that although closed strings see nongeometry, open strings see an undeformed conventional geometric torus but the original closed
string non-geometry is now reflected in the noncommutativity bivector θ in the dual gauge theory
description of D3-branes as a θ-deformed noncommutative supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory. The
T-duality monodromy for the geometric moduli of the closed string geometry is mapped to a Morita
monodromy for the moduli of noncommutative Yang–Mills theory.
14

4.3

Interpretation of the decoupling limit

We can give a physical derivation of this noncommutative gauge theory by adapting the description
of [26] which considered the case of vanishing fluxes and constant B-field. The essential features can
be seen already in the low-energy effective theory of a D1-brane on the twisted torus X wrapping
the torsion one-cycle ξ1 , and placed at y 2 = 0 and any fixed point x ∈ S 1 . We can think of the
original torus fibres T 2 of X as the complex plane C, with coordinate z = y 1 + i y 2 , quotiented
by the translations z 7→ z + α and z 7→ z + β τ (x) for α, β ∈ Z. In the scaling limit τ2◦ → 0
taken above, the torus fibre degenerates to the flat cylinder S 1 × R with coordinate y 1 ∈ [0, 1)
quotiented by the additional translations y 1 7→ y 1 + β θ(x); this is not a conventional Hausdorff
space for generic values of x ∈ S 1 , but can be precisely interpreted as the noncommutative torus
2 , which for irrational values of θ(x) is sometimes called the ‘irrational rotation algebra’. In
Tθ(x)
this geometric picture, the Morita invariance under parabolic monodromies around the base circle
2
2
2
is trivially realised as the equality Tθ(x+1)
= Tθ(x)+m
= Tθ(x)
under the identification of the periodic
1
1
coordinate y with y + m.
In the gauge theory on the D1-brane, there are additional light states formed by strings winding
w2 times around y 2 , viewed as open strings connecting the D1-brane and its images on the covering
space over y 2 , which have mass proportional to w2 τ2◦ . The complete low-energy spectrum for τ2◦ → 0
is thus obtained by considering fields fw2 (y 1 ) with an arbitrary dependence on both y 1 ∈ [0, 1) and
on w2 ∈ Z. The open string starting at (y 1 , 0) ends at (y 1 , w2 τ2◦ ), which is identified with the point
(y 1 − w2 θ(x), 0) on the twisted torus. Since open strings interact via concatenation of paths, in
(y 1 , w2 ) space the interaction of two fields fw2 and f˜w̃2 is given by





(4.29)
fw2 y 1 f˜w̃2 y 1 − w2 θ(x) = fw2 y 1 exp − w2 θ(x) ∂y∂ 1 f˜w̃2 y 1 .
By T-duality along the vector field

∂
,
∂y 2

which maps the winding number w2 to a momentum mode

p2 , followed by the usual Fourier transform of p2 = − i ∂y∂ 2 to y 2 , this interaction is given by the
noncommutative star-product f ⋆ f˜ from (4.24) in the gauge theory on the D2-brane in the dual Tfold frame; in particular, this shows that the star-product (4.24) is invariant under the monodromy
θ(x + 1) = θ(x) + m. The open string metric on the D2-brane in the scaling limit is obtained from
(4.20) with all other parameters as above and is the metric on a flat square torus with radii r1 , r2 .
2
This gives a family of D2-brane gauge theories on Tθ(x)
parameterised by x ∈ S 1 , such that after a
monodromy x 7→ x + 1 the noncommutative gauge theory returns to itself up to Morita equivalence,
which is a symmetry of the theory; in particular, this leaves the noncommutative Yang–Mills action
YM = S YM . The fibre over x of this parameterised family of noncommutative
SxYM invariant: Sx+1
x
gauge theories is dual to the low-energy effective theory of a D0-brane placed at y 1 = y 2 = 0 and
x ∈ S 1 on the three-torus T 3 with constant H-flux (4.10).

In this case GR = ISO(2) is the isometry group of the Euclidean plane R2 whose generators
satisfy
[J1 , Jx ] = m ϑ J2 ,

[J2 , Jx ] = −m ϑ J1

and

[J1 , J2 ] = 0 .

(5.7)

The group manifold of ISO(2) has the topology of S 1 × R2 which is compactified by the discrete
group action
y a 7−→ y a + β a ,

(5.8)

where β a ∈ Z for a = 1, 2; then X is topologically S 1 × T 2 . For U =

imply that H 1 (X, R) = R is generated by ζ x . By Poincaré duality it follows that H2 (X, Z) = Z
is generated by ξ1,2 , and in particular now both ξx,1 and ξx,2 are homologically trivial two-cycles.
On the other hand, for the Z4 monodromy, H1 (X, Z) = Z ⊕ Z2 is generated by the Z-valued S 1
base one-cycle ξx dual to ζ x , with the Z2 torsion one-cycle ξ1 given by the class of the y 1 circle
fibre [18].
The metric is given by (3.12). For the parabolic monodromy, T-dualising in y 1 gave a T 3 with
H-flux while T-dualising in y 2 gave a T-fold, but for this elliptic case, dualising in either y 1 or y 2
16

gives the same result, which is a T-fold with H-flux. Starting with the twisted torus metric (3.17),
we apply the Buscher construction along the abelian isometry generated by the vector field ∂y∂ 2 to
get a non-geometric background with metric and B-field given by

Worldvolume geometry

Unlike the parabolic case, here we cannot wrap a D2-brane on the base S 1 of the twisted torus.
Moreover, unlike the parabolic case, T-dualising the twisted torus with Z4 elliptic monodromy in
either of the torus fibre directions results in something non-geometric. Instead, we wrap a D1-brane
around the torsion one-cycle ξ1 as we did in §4.3. T-dualising y 2 gives a D2-brane in the T-fold
background with metric and B-field in (5.10), and dilaton in (5.11). Transforming now to the open
string metric and noncommutativity bivector on the D2-brane using (2.2) we find

Again since ∂y∂ a θ = 0, the star-product incorporating the dynamics of open strings in this background is given in the same form (4.24) quantising the three-dimensional algebra (4.25), which
17

however is no longer based on a Lie algebra but rather some quantum deformation of the Heisenberg Lie algebra determined by the discrete parameters m ∈ 4 Z + 1 and ϑ = π2 .
As before, the non-geometric nature of the closed string background is captured in the noncommutative gauge theory on the D2-brane via Morita equivalence. Under a monodromy in the circle
coordinate x, the noncommutativity parameter transforms in the expected way from (4.27) under
an SL(2, Z)θ Morita transformation corresponding to the elliptic monodromy matrix (5.1):
θ(x + 1) =

(5.17)

However, in contrast with the case of parabolic twists, here the metric on the D2-brane worldvolume WD2 is not globally well-defined, so that the open string sector now simultaneously probes
both a non-geometric and a noncommutative space. This is exactly what is needed to compen2
sate the Morita equivalence of the corresponding noncommutative fibre tori Tθ(x)
and render the
noncommutative Yang–Mills theory on WD2 invariant; in particular, the area of the non-geometric
worldvolume
2
(5.18)
V (x) = 4π 2 r1 r2 − τ1◦ sin(m ϑ x) + cos(m ϑ x)

transforms under a monodromy x 7→ x+ 1 in the expected way from (4.27) under the Morita duality

this reduces to

Finally, the Yang–Mills coupling of the decoupled noncommutative gauge theory in the non-geometric
T 2 -bundle over S 1 is x-dependent and is computed from (2.6) with p = 2 to get

which must be fixed in the zero slope limit, so that now the string coupling scales as gs = O(ǫ1/2 ).
Then the Yang–Mills coupling in the zero slope limit is still x-dependent and given by
gYM (x)2 = 2π ḡs − τ1◦ sin(m ϑ x) + cos(m ϑ x) .

(5.23)

Hence the Yang–Mills coupling also transforms in the expected way from (4.27) under the Morita

Thus again we obtain a family of noncommutative D2-brane gauge theories on Tθ(x)
parameterised
1
by x ∈ S . We stress that there is a well-defined action of the Morita duality transformations
on the gauge theory: all three moduli – the area, the noncommutativity parameter and the gauge
coupling – transform in a way that conspires to leave the gauge theory invariant. The underlying
noncommutative geometries here are new and generalise the field of noncommutative tori obtained
previously in the case of parabolic monodromies.

5.3

Interpretation of the Morita equivalence monodromy

The case of elliptic mondromies exhibits another new feature compared to the case of parabolic
twists. Recall that the parabolic monodromy affects only the noncommutativity bivector θ(x) and
2
2 ; in
is an exact invariance of the noncommutative torus at the topological level, Tθ(x+1)
= Tθ(x)
particular the star-product (4.24) is invariant under integer shifts θ(x + 1) = θ(x) + m. This is
no longer true for the Z4 elliptic twist, which requires the full machinery of Morita equivalence
of noncommutative tori to explain the invariance of the Yang–Mills theory on the D2-brane; this
necessitates, in particular, the non-trivial actions of the elliptic monodromy on the remaining moduli
of the gauge theory described above.
We can give a physical picture for this distinction by including the background magnetic flux
modulus Φ which twists the vacuum of the noncommutative gauge theory as discussed in §2. It
shifts the noncommutative field strength tensor F⋆ defining the Yang–Mills action by a closed twoform Φ on the D2-brane worldvolume to give
F = F⋆ + Φ .

(5.26)

Under a Morita transformation (4.27) with monodromy M, the magnetic flux Φ transforms as
M[Φ] = −(c θ + d)2 Φ + c (c θ + d) .

(5.27)

This also affects the spectrum of D-brane charges on the T 2 fibres: a generic configuration (n, q) ∈ Z2
of n D2-branes wrapping T 2 with q units of D0-brane charge, realised as a background magnetic charge q in U (n) noncommutative Yang–Mills theory, transforms as a vector under SL(2, Z)θ
to

For the parabolic monodromies (4.1) this has no effect; in that case Φ(x + 1) = Φ(x) and the
single D2-brane charge with (n, q) = (1, 0) that we have considered is mapped to itself. Thus we
can consistently set Φ = 0 for the parabolic case and simply write the standard noncommutative
Yang–Mills action in terms of F⋆ and single-valued gauge fields on the T 2 fibre.
In contrast, for the Z4 elliptic monodromy (5.4) the magnetic flux Φ on the D2-brane transforms
as
Φ(x + 1) = −θ(x)2 Φ(x) + θ(x) ,

19

(5.29)

while the single D2-brane charge (1, 0) that we started with is mapped to a single D0-brane charge
(0, −1); the notation (n, q), as above, denotes n units of D2-brane charge and q units of D0-brane
charge. This is solved by
Φ=−

x
dy 1 ∧ dy 2 ,
θ(x)

(5.30)

which should be properly incorporated in (5.26) in order to obtain the correct compactification of the
open string non-geometric background via shifts in x. Choosing the real part of the fixed modular
parameter τ ◦ to be τ1◦ = −1, the two-form (5.30) then correctly interpolates between the D0-brane
charges Φ(0) = 0 and Φ(1) = −1, implying that single-valued gauge fields are mapped to multivalued gauge fields on the D2-brane under the monodromy in the base coordinate x ∈ S 1 [51].
This effect may be interpreted in terms of open string boundary conditions. By observing that the
bivector θ(x) is constant on the D2-brane worldvolume, we can easily adapt the description of open
string ground states given in [27] as Morita equivalence bimodules for a noncommutative torus, as is
also done by [21] in a different context. We start with a single D2-brane placed at some fixed point
x ∈ S 1 , wrapping the T 2 fibre. Since open strings interact by concatenation of paths, the space of
open string ground states on the D2-brane forms an algebra Ax descending from the algebra of open
string tachyon vertex operators in the decoupling limit, which is precisely the algebra of functions
2
on the noncommutative torus Tθ(x)
with the star-product (4.24).
Consider now a string winding once around the x-circle, viewed in the covering space R over S 1
as an open string stretching with its left end on the (1, 0) D2-brane at the point x and with its
right end on some other configuration (n, q) of D2–D0-branes placed at the point x + 1, with the n
D2-branes wrapping T 2 and the q D0-branes located at y 1 = y 2 = 0 on T 2 . The configuration (n, q)
comes with its own algebra Ax+1 of open string ground states, identified as the algebra of functions
2
on Tθ(x+1)
for a suitable monodromy (4.27) of the noncommutativity parameter determined by the
transformation (5.28) of D-brane charges. Quantisation of the stretched open string with these
boundary conditions in the decoupling limit gives a space of states Hn,q which is a left module for
the algebra Ax , acting on the left end of the open string, and a right module for Ax+1 , acting on the
right end of the open string. The actions of Ax and Ax+1 commute because they act at opposite
ends of the open string, and together they generate the complete algebra of observables on the open
string tachyon ground states, acting irreducibly on Hn,q . This implies that the algebra Ax+1 is
the commutant of Ax in this space (and vice-versa), the maximal algebra of all operators on Hn,q
that commute with Ax . In [27] it is shown that the space Hn,q thus defines a Morita equivalence
bimodule over Ax × Ax+1 in this sense, which mathematically implements the Morita equivalence
between noncommutative tori whose algebras of functions are Ax and Ax+1 ; roughly speaking, this
implies that there is a bijective mapping between the “gauge bundles” over the noncommutative tori
2
2
Tθ(x)
and Tθ(x+1)
.
The parabolic Morita duality above dictates that the right end of the open string should also land
on a single (1, 0) D2-brane at x + 1. In this case the Morita equivalence is trivial: The space of open
string ground states H1,0 in the decoupling limit is simply a copy of the algebra Ax itself, or the
2
free bimodule over Ax , with the algebra Ax of functions on the noncommutative torus Tθ(x)
acting
2
2
from the left and the algebra Ax+1 = Ax of functions on Tθ(x+1) = Tθ(x) acting from the right, both
via the star-product (4.24); this identifies H1,0 as the space of functions on an ordinary torus T 2 .
Thus the parabolic monodromies recover the standard free bimodule over Ax .
In contrast, the Z4 elliptic Morita duality dictates that the right end of the open string should land
on a single (0, −1) D0-brane at x+1. The space of open string ground states H0,−1 in this case comes
from quantising a two-dimensional phase space, which is the cover of the torus T 2 with the Poisson
bracket {y 1 , y 2 } = θ(x). This may be identified as an algebra of functions on R in a Schrödinger
20

polarisation in which the algebra Ax acts on H0,−1 , regarded as the space of functions of y 2 , by
representing y 2 as multiplication by y 2 and y 1 as the derivative i θ(x) ∂y∂ 2 . The commutant of Ax in
H0,−1 is generated by operators given as multiplication by y 2 /θ(x) together with the derivative i ∂y∂ 2 ,
which quantise the Poisson bracket {y 1 , y 2 } = θ(x)−1 . This gives the standard Morita equivalence
bimodule over Ax × Ax+1 [27], with the algebra Ax of functions on the noncommutative torus
2
2
2
Tθ(x)
acting from the left and the algebra Ax+1 of functions on Tθ(x+1)
= T−1/θ(x)
acting from the
right.
More general Morita transformations of the D-brane charges, taking the initial configuration of
charges (1, 0) to a configuration (1, 1) with a unit of D0-brane charge inside a D2-brane, are possible
with the Z3 elliptic monodromy, and can be similarly interpreted on the space H1,1 of sections of a
line bundle over T 2 with Chern number 1 [27].

5.4

D2-brane theory at the orbifold point

In twisted dimensional reductions, the scaling limits discussed in this section describe D-branes with
x-dependent noncommutativity parameters θ(x) coupled to gauged supergravity. One of the most
interesting features of elliptic twists, as compared to parabolic twists, is that they each admit a fixed
point in moduli space at which the twisted reduction reduces to an orbifold reduction and so gives
an exact string theory realisation [11]. The fixed point for a given elliptic twist is at a minimum of
the corresponding Scherk–Schwarz potential at which the potential vanishes, and so gives a stable
compactification to Minkowski space [11]. The twist γ(x) at the fixed point is independent of x and
the monodromy M generates a cyclic group of order p for some integer p, Mp = 1. The twisted
reduction at the fixed point then is realised as a Zp orbifold of the theory compactified on T 3 . This
is given by the compactification on S 1 × T 2 orbifolded by the action of M on the T 2 conformal field
theory together with a shift x 7→ x + p1 of the coordinate x of the S 1 . In particular, from (5.5) it
follows that τ ◦ = i is a fixed point of the SL(2, Z) transformation generated by (5.1) for U = 1: In
that case τ (x) = i independently of x ∈ S 1 , and the minimum of the potential gives a Minkowski
vacuum. The construction is a Z4 orbifold of the compactification on S 1 × Tτ2(x)= i with the Z4 twist
of the conformal field theory on the T 2 with τ ◦ = i accompanied by a shift x 7→ x + 14 .
At this point it is not possible to decouple open and closed string modes on the D2-brane, which
would require a scaling limit τ2◦ → 0. In fact, at this point the B-field vanishes and the closed string
metric
2
2
gτ (x)= i = (2π r dx)2 + 2π r1 dy 1 + 2π r2 dy 2
(5.31)

coincides exactly with the T 3 metric for finite string slope α′ and area A. As expected from
the open-closed transformation (2.2) with B = 0, in this case the open and closed string metrics
on the D2-brane coincide while the noncommutativity vanishes, Θ = 0. The dilaton is given by
e φτ (x)= i = (2π α′ /A)1/2 and hence the Yang–Mills coupling at the fixed point is the α′ -independent
constant

gYM τ (x)= i =

Thus in this case the closed string geometry is identical to the open string geometry, and the
worldvolume gauge theory on the D2-brane is that of an ordinary commutative supersymmetric
Yang–Mills theory on a flat torus T 2 ⊂ T 3 . The same is expected to be true for the Z3 (and Z6 )
twist at the fixed point τ ◦ = e π i /3 , which can be viewed as a Z3 orbifold and as a toroidal reduction
with magnetic flux.

D-branes and doubled twisted torus geometry

Having understood the non-geometric T-fold backgrounds, our aim now is to study D-branes in the
essentially doubled space obtained by T-duality in the x-direction. However, T-duality along the
∂
is problematic because the background depends explicitly on x ∈ S 1 : The vector
vector field ∂x
∂
field ∂x
does not generate an isometry of the torus bundle and the Buscher construction can no
longer be applied. For such cases, we use a generalised T-duality [7] which takes a background with
dependence on x to an essentially doubled background in which the fields depend on the coordinate
x
e of the T-dual circle and so are problematic to interpret in conventional terms.

The reduction with duality twist by an O(d, d; Z) monodromy around the x-circle is generalised
to a twisted construction with both a twist along x and along its dual coordinate x
e, so that the
dependence of the moduli E(x, x
e) is through a local section γ : S 1 × S 1 → O(d, d) given by

γ(x, x

both valued in O(d, d; Z). A general non-geometric reduction then gives rise to a torus bundle

noncommutative Yang–Mills theories on D-branes in a doubled geometry of this type which is the
natural lift of the twisted torus backgrounds considered in §3.
We will formulate the theory using a doubled geometry with coordinates (x, x
e, y a , yea ). Such a doubled formulation was first proposed in [33] and developed in [34–36], replacing the doubled torus
with a twisted version, the doubled twisted torus. This 2n-dimensional doubled geometry incorporates all the dual forms of the n-dimensional background, with the different backgrounds arising
from different polarisations, which give different n-dimensional ‘slices’. This doubled geometry has
been recently discussed in [54].

6.1

The doubled twisted torus

Following [35, 36], we extend the twisted torus X = GZ \ GR of §3 to the 2n-dimensional doubled
twisted torus
X = GZ \ GR

(6.3)

where the 2n-dimensional non-compact Lie group GR is the cotangent bundle GR = T ∗ GR = GR ⋉Rn ;
this is a Drinfeld double, and GZ is a discrete cocompact subgroup of GR . The local structure of X
is given by the Lie algebra of GR whose generators JM , M = 1, . . . , 2n, have brackets
[JM , JN ] = tM N P JP ,

(6.4)

with structure constants tM N P satisfying the Jacobi identity t[M N Q tP ]QT = 0. The Lie algebra
admits an O(n, n)-invariant constant symmetric bilinear form ηM N of signature (n, n), and so GR is
a 2n-dimensional subgroup of O(n, n). The generators JM consist of Jm = {Jx , Ja }, a = 1, . . . , d,
m = 1, . . . , n, generating the GR subgroup, and Jem = {Jex , Jea } generating the Rn subgroup.

where fmn p are the structure constants for GR .

The group manifold of GR is parameterised by coordinates (x, y 1 , . . . , y d ) on GR as in (3.6), and coore R = Rn . The quotient by the action of the discrete cocompact subgroup

for O ∈ O(n, n). This is essentially the O(n, n) structure group of generalised geometry, acting on
the generalised tangent bundle T X ⊕ T ∗ X of the n-dimensional twisted torus X. Note, however,
that O(n, n; Z) is not a symmetry in this case. Consider the subgroup GL(n, Z) ⊂ O(n, n; Z). For
T n , the group of large diffeomorphisms is GL(n, Z), but for the n-dimensional twisted torus X,
GL(n, Z) is not a symmetry, although the subgroup GL(d, Z) acting on the T d fibres is. For string
theory on X, or any of its T-duals, there is an O(d, d; Z) T-duality symmetry acting in the conformal
field theory on the T d fibres; in the doubled formalism, this acts as a diffeomorphism on the T 2d
doubled torus fibres of X . For n = 3 (d = 2), this O(2, 2; Z) acting on (y a , yea ) recovers the Tduality orbits of the three-dimensional twisted torus from §4 and §5. For O ∈ O(d, d; Z) ⊂ O(n, n),

The transformation JM 7−→ JN ON M changes the split of the Lie algebra generators JM into
Jn , Jem and so changes the form of the algebra (6.8) to an algebra of the form

[Jem , Jen ] = Qp mn Jep + Rmnp Jp ,

[Jn , Jem ] = −fnp m Jep + Qn mp Jp ,

where the various tensors are determined by the choice of O, and are sometimes referred to as
fluxes.
In [35], these dualities were interpreted in terms of the choice of polarisation, generalising the picture
in [1]. A polarisation splits the tangent bundle T X of X at each point into an n-dimensional
e and the issue is whether the split of
physical subspace Π and an n-dimensional dual subspace Π,
the tangent vectors defines an n-dimensional submanifold (at least locally) which can be viewed as
e define an integrable distribution on X , then there
a patch of spacetime. If the spaces Π and Π
is locally a physical subspace of X and the background is locally geometric. If the distribution
is non-integrable, then there is no such local spacetime and the background is not geometric even
locally; it is essentially doubled. The polarisation splits the 2n Lie algebra generators JM into two
sets of n generators, the Jm and the Jem . The integrability condition is that the Jem generate a
eR ⊂ GR . Then the physical spacetime is defined by the quotient by G
eR . The covering
subgroup G

space for X is GR and the covering space for the physical subspace is the coset GR /G

D-branes in the doubled twisted torus

D-branes in the doubled picture were discussed for the doubled torus and for doubled torus fibrations
in [1, 18], and this was extended to the doubled twisted torus in [19]. Following [19], let us now
describe D-branes in the doubled twisted torus geometry.
The starting point is the doubled sigma-model which was introduced in [35] for maps embedding a
closed string worldsheet Σ in X . These maps pull back the one-forms P M to one-forms P̂ M on Σ.
Introducing a three-dimensional manifold V with boundary ∂V = Σ and extending the maps to V ,
the sigma-model is defined by the action
I
Z
1
1
MM N P̂ M ∧ ∗P̂ N +
K̂ ,
(6.27)
SX =
4 Σ
2 V
where K̂ is the pullback of the Wess–Zumino three-form K to V and ∗ is the Hodge duality operator
on Σ. To recover the ordinary non-linear sigma-model on a physical target space, this doubled
sigma-model is subjected to the self-duality constraint
P̂ M = η M P MP N ∗ P̂ N

(6.28)

which eliminates half of the 2n degrees of freedom by restricting n of them to be right-moving and
n of them to be left-moving on Σ. In [35] this constraint was imposed by choosing a polarisation
and then gauging the sigma-model.
In the case that the structure constants Rmnp in (6.23) vanish, so that the Jem generate a subgroup
e R ⊂ GR , then the reduction to the physical subspace can be achieved by gauging the action of
G
e R . On quotienting by the discrete subgroup GZ and eliminating the worldsheet gauge fields, one
G
eR
obtains a standard non-linear sigma-model on a target space described locally by the coset GR /G
1
d
with coordinates (x, y , . . . , y ), with metric and B-field given from the generalised metric (6.25),
and with physical H-field strength given by
H = dB .

(6.29)

For more general doubled groups that are not Drinfeld doubles, the equation for H has further
terms which are given in [35].
On the other hand, if the structure constants Rmnp in (6.23) are non-zero, then the sigma-model
will depend explicitly on both x and x
e. In this essentially doubled case, the metric and H-field
strength depend on both x and x
e, and it appears that there is no interpretation of the sigma-model
in terms of a conventional n-dimensional spacetime.
26

In [19] it was shown that the same sigma-model action (6.27) can be used to describe the embedding
of an open string worldsheet Σ in the doubled space X . In this case one must specify boundary
conditions by demanding that the string maps should send the boundary ∂Σ of Σ to a given
submanifold W ⊂ X , the worldvolume of a D-brane in the doubled space X . This requires
that the embedding of the boundary ∂V of the three-dimensional manifold V is the sum of the
embedding of Σ with some chain D ⊆ W , and consistency of the Wess–Zumino term in (6.27)
requires that the pullback of the three-form K to D vanishes, K|D = 0. One can then analyse the
boundary equations of motion as well as the self-duality constraint (6.28) with these conditions.
In [19] it is shown that as a result the worldvolume W of a D-brane in the doubled twisted torus
is a subspace of X which is maximally isotropic with respect to the O(n, n)-invariant metric η.
Choosing a polarisation then picks out physical worldvolume coordinates, so that the physical Dbrane wraps that part of the physical space which intersects the generalised D-brane subspace W .
D-branes in the doubled space are specified by complementary Dirichlet and Neumann projectors
that respectively project the tangent bundle of X at each point into subspaces normal and tangential
to the worldvolume wrapped by the D-brane. Both subspaces are null with respect to η, and they are
mutually orthogonal to each other with respect to the doubled metric H. The Neumann projector
moreover satisfies an integrability condition ensuring that the D-brane worldvolume W is locally
a smooth submanifold of X . The vanishing of the Wess–Zumino three-form K on W further
constrains the structure constants tM N P of the Lie algebra of GR which restricts the orientation of
the D-brane in X .
This construction implies, in particular, that for each Neumann condition there is a corresponding
Dirichlet condition. Thus there are always n Neumann directions and n Dirichlet directions on the
doubled twisted torus X , and these directions each form a null subspace of X . As a consequence,
any D-brane in a physical n-dimensional polarisation always arises from a Dn-brane in the extended
2n-dimensional doubled geometry.
As before, we shall study the cases with n = 3 in detail. Starting from the three-dimensional
spacetime polarisation above onto the twisted torus X, we will follow the T-duality orbits of Dbranes in X . The D-brane projectors transform under the action of the T-duality operator O, and
the possible D-branes in the various T-duality frames are classified using the doubled twisted torus
formalism by [19]. In particular, some anticipated worldsheet classification results are confirmed
explicitly in this way; for example, it is known that D3-branes cannot wrap the three-torus T 3
with non-zero H-flux due to the Freed–Witten anomaly [55] (because T 3 is a spinc -manifold and so
anomaly cancellation requires m = [H] = W3 (T 3 ) = 0).

D2-branes on T-folds

We start by rederiving the results of §4 and §5 in the doubled picture, which involve T-duality transformations in the y a direction corresponding to Oya ∈ O(2, 2; Z). Starting from the twisted torus
with metric (3.17) and vanishing B-field, we write the corresponding doubled metric from (6.25):

Reading off the closed string metric and B-field from (6.25) yields precisely (5.10) for the nongeometric T 2 -bundle over S 1 , while (6.26), with vanishing dilaton on the twisted torus, yields
the anticipated dilaton field (5.11). The H-field strength is given by H = dB. In this case the

is locally modelled on the coset GR \ GR but is not globally well-defined, and a global description
of the background in terms of conventional geometry is not possible. However, the T-fold is a
submanifold of the doubled twisted torus X , because O(2, 2; Z) ⊂ GL(4, Z) acts geometrically
on the doubled torus fibres. As the only non-vanishing structure constants are Qx ab = δac Mc b ,
we obtain the allowed D2-brane configuration displayed in Table 1 [19]; as Morita duality acts
entirely within the noncommutative Yang–Mills theory on the D2-brane, and in particular does not
mix gauge theory modes with string winding states, the same picture of a parameterised family
of D2-brane gauge theories fibred over the x-circle emerges in the doubled geometry, returning
to itself under a monodromy x 7→ x + 1 up to Morita equivalence, which is a symmetry of the
noncommutative gauge theory. On the other hand, the D3-brane considered in §4 is not a consistent
worldvolume when embedded as a three-dimensional subspace of the six-dimensional doubled twisted
torus X [19].

D3-branes on essentially doubled spaces

Recall that one motivation for turning to the doubled twisted torus formalism is that it enables us
to perform the generalised T-duality transformation along the non-isometric base direction of the
original T 2 -bundle over S 1 . This maps the original D1-brane configuration to a D3-brane wrapping
an essentially doubled background. In this final section we will discuss how to make sense of the
noncommutative supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory on D3-branes in essentially doubled spaces in
the decoupling limit using the doubled twisted torus formalism.

The explicit dependence on the dual coordinate x
e reflects the non-geometric nature of the essentially
doubled space: In this polarisation the generators Jem do not close to a subalgebra and a conventional
description of the background cannot be recovered even locally.
In this polarisation the Wess–Zumino three-form

KR = − 12 δac Mc b de

(7.4)

vanishes as required on the worldvolume of the D3-brane, which wraps the directions with coordinates (x, y 1 , y 2 ). It is shown by [35] that it is possible to use the self-duality constraint (6.28)
to completely remove the dependence of the doubled worldsheet sigma-model on the pullbacks of
de
xm and write the doubled theory as a non-linear sigma-model for the metric gR and B-field BR
in (7.2), depending explicitly on the winding coordinate x
e, thus rendering the coordinate fields
non-dynamical along the dual directions (e
x, ye1 , ye2 ).
Using (2.2) we now compute the open string metric and noncommutativity bivector on the D3-brane

Noncommutative Yang–Mills theory

To find a decoupling limit with pure gauge theory on the D3-brane worldvolume, we note that the
T 2 -fibre parts of the open string geometry (7.5) coincide with those of the T-folds, given in (5.14),
upon replacing the base S 1 coordinate x with its dual coordinate x
e. Thus the scaling limit will
involve taking α′ = O(ǫ1/2 ), A = O(ǫ1/2 ) and τ2◦ = O(ǫ1/2 ), with ǫ → 0 and the radii (4.19) held
fixed exactly as previously, and in addition r = O(ǫ1/2 ) with the base radius

parabolic twists and from (5.15) (with m ∈ 4 Z + 1 and ϑ = π2 ) in the case of the Z4 elliptic twist.
Note that in this limit, the original twisted torus X and the dual T-fold completely degenerate to
a point, even though the bivector ΘR has no components along the S 1 base.

which requires the string coupling to scale as gs = O(ǫ1/2 ). Then the finite Yang–Mills coupling in
the scaling limit is given by (4.23) in the case of parabolic twists, and by (5.23) (for m ∈ 4 Z + 1
e in the case of the Z4 elliptic twist.
and ϑ = π2 ) with x → x

Since the D3-brane wraps the T 2 fibres over the dual x
e-circle in this case, we now obtain a parameterised noncommutative worldvolume gauge theory, with noncommutative associative star-products

which is invariant up to Morita equivalence under monodromies x
e 7→ x
e + 1, in the same sense as
explained in §4 and §5. This shows that a D3-brane wrapping the essentially doubled space has
a sensible low-energy effective description, which can be understood as a noncommutative gauge
theory over a compactification of the x
e-direction transverse to its worldvolume in the doubled
twisted torus X using Morita duality. Following the discussion of §5.3, in the case of the Z4
elliptic monodromy the noncommutative Yang–Mills action should be augmented by replacing the
noncommutative field strength tensor Fe⋆ with
e ,
Fe = Fe⋆ + Φ

thus exibiting further non-geometric dependence of the noncommutative gauge theory on the winding coordinate x
e.

This can be interpreted as follows. Consider, for example, a D2-brane wrapping the (y 1 , y 2 )directions. As discussed in §1, this is secretly a D3-brane wrapping the (e
x, y 1 , y 2 )-directions in
the doubled space (see Table 1). In the usual (untwisted) case, there is no x
e-dependence of either the closed background (g, B, φ) or the open string moduli (GR , ΘR , gYM ) and one can project
to the “physical space” with coordinates (x, y 1 , y 2 ), obtaining a 2 + 1-dimensional supersymmetric
Yang–Mills theory in (y 1 , y 2 , t)-space as the low-energy effective description of the D2-brane. On
the other hand, in the twisted case, the open string background has a genuine x
e-dependence, and
so the theory cannot be interpreted in the physical space. This results in a worldvolume theory in
the full (e
x, y 1 , y 2 , t)-space. A similar interpretation holds for other D-branes.
