ABSTRACT

We investigate analytically whether in a close encounter with a star, a Dark Matter particle can
be accelerated above the escape speed of a Globular Cluster and be ejected. We find that this
mechanism is not sufficient to eject a massive, extended Dark Matter halo by the present time.
Combined with observations of isolated Globular Clusters that may not have had their halos
tidally stripped, these results cast doubt on the scenario in which Globular Clusters formed in
Dark Matter halos.
Key words: (cosmology:) dark matter – (Galaxy:) globular clusters: general

INTRODUCTION

In the ΛCDM paradigm, Dark Matter (DM) is the first matter constituent to collapse, forming DM halos which serve as the seeds for
galaxy formation. Progressively larger structures are built through
the mergers of halos. This hierarchical structure formation is predicted by theory and is seen in N-body simulations, as well as
observed in the structure of galaxies and galaxy clusters.
One seeming exception to this scenario are Globular Clusters
(GC). Peebles (1984) was the first to propose that GCs form in
extended DM halos. However, observations of many GCs reveal
thin tidal tails that N-body simulations predict should not form if
they possess halos Grillmair et al. (1995); Odenkirchen et al. (2003);
Moore (1996). Moreover, recent studies of several GCs indicate that
the ratio of the mass in DM to stars in several GCs is less than unity
(MDM /M∗ . 1) Shin et al. (2013); Conroy et al. (2011); Ibata
et al. (2013) and is potentially . 10−2 if the DM is a low mass
(m χ ∼ 10 GeV) weakly interacting particle Hurst et al. (2015).
It is now generally thought GCs formed in gas compressed by
shocks Gunn (1980); Harris & Pudritz (1994). However, the formation scenarios of GCs remain controversial in part because of
the complex abundance patterns measured in stars. These observations indicate that GCs must have been much more massive in the
past in order to retain significant amounts of heavy elements that
would have been ejected by supernovae Gratton et al. (2004, 2012);
Conroy & Spergel (2011). As pointed out in Conroy et al. (2011)
this formation scenario is further complicated by the existence of
nuclear star clusters, which demonstrates that at least some GC-like
systems form in DM halos (e.g. Taylor et al. (2015); Böker et al.
(2004); Walcher et al. (2005, 2006)).
As the resolution of N-body simulations has improved it has
become possible to study small stellar populations such as GCs

Phipps et al. (2019). Recently several groups have made progress
on identifying GCs in N-body simulations Ishiyama et al. (2013);
Rieder et al. (2013); Kim et al. (2018); Carlberg (2018); ReinaCampos et al. (2019); Li & Gnedin (2019); Ma et al. (2019); Phipps
et al. (2019). In particular Phipps et al. (2019) identify infant GCs
at z > 6 within the cosmological simulations from the First Billion
Years (FiBY) project. These authors suggest that GCs formed from
high baryon fraction systems embedded within the peaks of their
Galaxy’s host halos. Therefore, these systems may possess a small
number of energetically bound DM particles, yet they still formed
in high DM density environments.
Though they seemingly do not possess DM halos today, GCs
could have had them in the past and subsequently lost their DM. One
mechanism invoked for the removal of the halo is tidal stripping by
the galaxy Bromm & Clarke (2002); Mashchenko & Sills (2005).
While the majority of the Galactic Globular Clusters (GGC) orbit
within strong tidal fields, there does exist a population of isolated
GCs with galactocentric distances rgc > 70 kpc that should not have
lost their halos through tidal interactions. Two such GCs are NGC
2419 (rgc = 89.9 kpc) and MGC1, which at ∼ 200 kpc from M31 is
the most isolated cluster in the local group Harris (1996); Conroy
et al. (2011); Mackey et al. (2010). Observations of both these
clusters indicate that MDM /M∗ . 1 Conroy et al. (2011); Ibata et al.
(2013). Note that several clusters that meet this definition of isolated
actually do show evidence for tidal structures, so it can not be ruled
out that clusters with rgc > 70 kpc have had their hypothetical halos
tidally stripped Sohn et al. (2003); Myeong et al. (2017); Sollima
et al. (2011). In particular, Palomar 4 shows evidence for tidal
structures despite a galactocentric distance rgc = 111.4 kpc Sohn
et al. (2003); Harris (1996).
There are several channels through which GCs could eject DM
halos, e.g. DM decay Peter (2010) and stellar feedback Davis et al.
(2014). In this paper we investigate the following mechanism: In a
close encounter with a star, a DM particle can be accelerated above

2

the escape speed of the GC and be ejected. In principle, the DM halo
can also evaporate if a DM particle slowly builds up speed through
multiple interactions with stars. However, this mechanism is not
efficient in GCs because particles with velocities near the escape
speed spend most of their time near the outskirts of the GC and
therefore, rarely experience an encounter with a star Henon (1969).
Of course, a star does not interact with a single DM particle, but with
many, so the ejection rate is closely related to the dynamical friction
timescale. In Baumgardt & Mieske (2008) it was found using Nbody simulations that the inner portions of the halos of GCs should
be scattered to beyond the half-mass radius in significantly less than
a Hubble time. Note that this provides more opportunity for the halo
to be tidally stripped.
In this paper we will investigate the escape rate of DM particles
from a spherically symmetric stellar system in order to ascertain the
viability of the ejection scenario. As the interaction is gravitational,
we shall not trouble ourselves with the details of the DM particle.
The only assumption we make of the DM particle is that its mass is
significantly less than the mass of a typical star.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: in §2 we
outline the calculation of the escape rate of DM particles from an
isolated, spherical stellar system. In §3 we present our results, and
in §4 we discuss our conclusions.

paper we will denote the local escape velocity simply as ve . Using the
notation of Henon (1969), let e, δ, ϕ be a set of spherical coordinates
for the kick velocity e®. Then from Equation (5), the condition for
escape is
v 2 + e2 + 2ve cos δ > ve2 .

Then we can write the probability that the DM particle will escape
in a time dt as:

Our calculation will follow the approach of a pair of classic papers by Hénon (Hénon (1960); Henon (1969)). We begin with the
assumption that the DM and stellar distributions are spherically
symmetric and that the particle velocities are isotropic. Then, the
number of DM particles in a phase space volume element d 3 r d 3 v

distribution function is g(r, v 0, m 0 ) then the number of stars in the

Equation (15) to Nχ rather than 1 to make this point explicit.

(21)

which is stronger than (12). C1 < C2 requires that,

e < 2(v 0 + v) = e3,

(23)

which further restricts (12). C3 will be the lower limit of the dC
integral when C1 < C3 or when
e > v + ve = e4,

(24)

and C2 will be the upper limit when C2 < C4 or when
e > 2(v 0 − v) = e5 .

(25)

Thus, in order to determine the limits of the integrals in S, we must
consider the order of e1, e2, e3, e4 , and e5 . Elementary calculations
show that

divide the v-v 0 plane into 5 regions A, B, C, D, and E. In region A,

Here we can not simultaneously satisfy e > e1, e > e2, and e < e3 ,
thus region D is forbidden. In region E,
e5 6 e1 6 e3 6 e4 6 e2 .

(34)

So region E is forbidden for the same reason as D. Scattering events
in the forbidden regions do not lead to ejection because the required
kick velocity is too large. In the reference frame of the star, the DM
particle must take a hyperbolic trajectory. There is therefore a limit
to how much the star can ‘bend’ the trajectory of the DM particle.
Relative to the cluster, this translates to a limit on the speed that can
be gained by the DM particle. Mathematically this is manifested
in equations (13) and (14), which involve both the magnitude and
direction of the kick velocity. These equations set the bounds on
the integral of cos δ. In regions D and E the required lower limit on
cos δ becomes greater than the required upper limit, so this portion
of parameter space is forbidden. Now Equation (16) becomes,

functions. We take for the stellar component a Plummer model

4π (r 2 + r 2 )5/2

10-6

(36)

where r0 is the scale radius of the GC and the half-mass radius is
rh ∼ 1.3r0 by definition. As there is little guidance on what the
distribution function of DM in a GC might be, we will also use a
Plummer model for the DM
r χ2
3MDM
,
4π (r 2 + r χ2 )5/2

(37)

where r χ is the scale radius of the DM halo. We choose the Plummer
model for the DM in part because it has some nice mathematical
properties that make it a convenient choice. Moreover, the Plummer
model is reasonably realistic for GCs Henon (1969) and is similar
to the structures of simulated DM halos and elliptical galaxies. One
shortcoming of the Plummer model is that it lacks mass segregation
which is known to occur (e.g. Aarseth (1966)). This in turn implies
that velocities are uncorrelated, but the error is small and there is
no known analytical cluster model with mass segregation Henon
(1969).
Now the gravitational potential is
−GM∗
−GMDM
φ(r) = 
 1/2 + 
 1/2 .
r 2 + r02
r 2 + r χ2

(38)

In general the scale radii of the 2 components need not be the same.
If r χ , r0 the analytic expressions needed to derive the distribution
function become cumbersome and we treat this case numerically.
Due to the assumption of isotropy, the distribution function depends
only on the magnitude of the velocity, or equivalently the kinetic
energy. Figure 1 shows the distribution function f (ε) as a function
of the magnitude of the specific energy ε = 21 [ve2 − v 2 ] for a GC
with M∗ = 2 × 106 M , r0 = 10 pc, and MDM = M∗ . The solid
line is the standard Plummer model in the case that r χ = r0 . The
dashed green line shows the numerical result for this case, which
is in agreement with the analytic case. The dotted line shows the
distribution function in the case that r χ = r0 /10, while the dotdashed line shows the case where r χ = 10r0 . The inset is a zoom
in of the latter case, which shows the feature at ε ≈ 150 (km/s)2 .
Since ε is inversely proportional to r, when r χ = r0 /10 we expect
that most of the DM should be at large ε (small r). The flat part
of the distribution function near ε = 2000 (km/s)2 is the transition
from mostly stars at large r to stars and DM at r ∼ r0 /10. The
distribution function is also pushed to higher energies as more mass
is concentrated in the center, increasing the orbital velocities in that
region. The oppositie is true for the case r χ = 10r0 .
In the case that r0 = r χ we will have the standard Plummer
distribution,

Let us now choose a particular stellar mass spectrum. We begin
with the Initial Mass Function (IMF) from Kroupa (2001). All of
the GGCs should have ages of order ∼ 10 Gyr, meaning that their
Main Sequence (MS) turnoffs should be at approximately 1 M .
Therefore, in order to obtain a crude approximation of the present
day stellar mass spectrum, we simply cut off the IMF at 1 M . Note
that this is highly conservative as stellar remnants such as Neutron
Stars, White Dwarfs, and Black Holes as well as any stars still on
the Giant and Horizontal Branches should contribute to the escape
rate. Furthermore, higher mass stars are given more weight in the
integral over mass in Equation (43). The escape rate scales linearly
for small variations in the mass cut, e.g. raising the cut off mass to

the cut off mass to 0.8 M decreases the escape by a factor of 0.7.
Given the cumbersome nature of Equation (43), it is useful to
have an approximate formula for the escape rate. Performing a fit to

RESULTS

In Figure 2 we consider the result of integrating Equation (43)
numerically for different values of the ratio MDM /M∗ and compare
these results to the GGCs (as well as the cluster MGC1 located in
M31). Contours of the specific escape rate for GCs with r0 = r χ are
shown with solid black lines. The blue triangles represent MGC1,
an isolated cluster orbiting M31, and the isolated population of
GGCs (rgc > 70 kpc) with no evidence of tidal structures. As noted
in §1, most of the GGCs could have lost their DM halos through
tidal interactions with the Galaxy. We shall therefore pay particular
attention to the most isolated GCs. The green circles denote the
remaining GGCs. The solid blue line is the location where the
specific escape rate is 1/τ with τ = 13.8 Gyr the approximate age

GGCs (rg c > 70 kpc) that show no evidence of tidal structures. These
isolated GCs are further considered in Figure 7. The remaining GGCs are
denoted with green circles. The solid blue line is the location where the
specific escape rate is 1/τ with τ = 13.8 Gyr the approximate age of the
Universe. GCs with escape rates comparable to or exceeding this limit should
have ejected a significant portion of their DM halos. However, none of the
clusters reach this limit regardless of the value of MDM /M∗ , with the most
massive halos having the lowest escape rates as expected.

of the Universe Planck Collaboration et al. (2018). GCs with escape
rates comparable to or exceeding this limit should have ejected a
significant portion of their DM halos. However, none of the clusters
reach this limit regardless of the value of MDM /M∗ . Note that
the escape rate is no longer sensitive to the value of MDM /M∗
once this ratio has dropped below ∼ 10−2 . We also note that more
massive GCs have lower escape rates due to their higher escape
speeds, while GCs that are larger in size have lower escape rates
due to the decreased probability of experiencing an encounter at
higher radii. To demonstrate this we integrate Eq. (43) with respect
to all variables save for the radius in the case of a cluster with
M∗ = MDM = 2 × 106 M and r0 = r χ = 10 pc. The resulting
“radial escape rate" is the specific escape rate from a spherical shell
d N (r)
of radius r, which we denote dt . The radial escape rate is shown
in Fig. 3, where we see that it peaks around r ∼ 0.5r0 and has fallen
by nearly two orders of magnitude by r ∼ 2r0 .
In Figs. 4 & 7 we consider the effect of varying r χ with respect to r0 while holding MDM /M∗ = 1. We consider r χ = 10r0 ,
which might correspond to an extended primordial halo, as well as
r χ = 10−1 r0 , which might correspond to a cluster that has had the
outer part of its DM halo stripped by tidal interactions. The results
are obtained by integrating Equation (35) with the appropriate numerically derived distribution functions (see Figure 1). Note that for
r χ = 10r0 , much of the DM exists beyond the stellar content of the
GC and therefore never experiences a close encounter with a star.
Thus we might normalize Equation (35) by the number of DM particles within the stellar content (say within r0 ), rather than the total

number of particles. This choice of normalization would reflect the
escape rate of particles that actually experience close encounters
with stars. In the case of an extended halo, slightly less than 20%
of the DM particles are within r0 , therefore we could multiply the
results for r χ = 10r0 by a factor of ∼ 5 in Figures 4 & 7. This
would still leave the escape rates from extended halos well below
the figure of merit, τ −1 .
We first consider, in Figure 4, a subset of the GGCs whose
properties span those of the full distribution. The parameters for
these clusters are summarized in Table 1, where the masses and
radii are taken from Harris (1996), while the estimates for MDM are

from Shin et al. (2013), and the V-band mass-to-light ratios are from
Baumgardt & Hilker (2018). In actuality, the observations provide
projected half-light radii Rh . We convert these to 3D half-mass radii
rh under the assumptions that mass follows light and rh /Rh = 1.305
as in Kowalczyk & Łokas (2014); Wolf et al. (2010). Note that decreasing r χ increases the escape rate. This result is perhaps counter
intuitive as a smaller halo should have a deeper potential well,
which is correspondingly more difficult to escape from. This can
be seen in the central escape velocities, which we have plotted in
Fig. (5). However, in a smaller halo, the probability of experiencing
an encounter is much higher, which explains the results. Of course,
the opposite is true for larger halos. Though they are easier to escape from, the probability of encounter is decreased. Note, that for
MDM /M∗ = 1 the only halo which exceeds 1/τ is that of Pal 1 in the
case that r χ = 10−1 r0 . However, the escape rate can be increased
by an additional half dex for smaller values of the ratio MDM /M∗ .
Fig 4 then indicates that clusters with MDM /M∗ . 10−2 and r0 not
more than a few parsecs, could have ejected a small remnant halo
after the initial halo was tidally stripped. This also suggests that such
clusters could have significantly dispersed the inner regions of their
halos, even if their halos were larger —consistent with the findings
of Baumgardt & Mieske (2008) based on N-body simulations. The
ejection of DM is also closely related to the two-body relaxation
process, so we might expect the ejection rate to scale with cluster
properties in the same way as the relaxation time. This is demonstrated in Fig 6 where we have plotted the median relaxation time
Harris (1996) and the inverse of the escape rate.
In Figure 7 we consider the escape rates for the most isolated
clusters in the Milky Way and M31, which are marked with blue triangles in Figure 2. The parameters for these clusters are summarized
in Table 2, where the masses and radii are taken from Harris (1996),
while the limits on MDM are from Conroy et al. (2011); Ibata et al.
(2013), and the V-band mass-to-light ratios are from Baumgardt &
Hilker (2018). We convert the observed projected half-light radii to
3D half-mass radii under the assumptions discussed above. Due to
their large sizes (r0 > 10 pc), these clusters all have escape rates far

CONCLUSIONS

GCs are peculiar systems in that they are the largest structures in the
Universe not dominated by DM. Though they do not possess halos
today, it is possible that they did in the past. One viable mechanism
by which GCs can lose DM halos is through tidal interactions with
the Galaxy. However, there exists a population of isolated GCs
which should not have had their halos tidally stripped (if they ever
possessed them). Observations of 2 of these GCs (NGC 2419 &
MGC1) indicate that they do not possess significant halos today
(MDM . M∗ , see Table 2).
In this paper we have investigated an additional mechanism
for the removal of DM from a GC: the ejection of DM in a single
close encounter with a star. We have found that GCs could not have
ejected a significant DM halo—with one exception. GCs that are
sufficiently small could have ejected a small remnant halo after the
majority of the halo was tidally stripped. Our results cast further
doubt on the formation of GCs in extended, massive DM halos.
In the context of WIMP astronomy, GCs remain interesting targets. As the stellar density of a GC is extremely high
(104 − 106 stars/pc3 ), even a subdominant DM halo could have
a density several orders of magnitude greater than that of the Solar
neighborhood ρ χ ∼ 0.4 GeV/cm3 . Current limits on the mass of
any hypothetical DM halo are of order the stellar mass of the cluster.
Our results indicate that such a halo could persist to the present day.
