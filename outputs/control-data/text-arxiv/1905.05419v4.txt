Abstract: In this review article we consider theoretically and give experimental support to the
models of the Fermi-Bose mixtures and the BCS-BEC crossover compared with the strong-coupling
approach, which can serve as the cornerstones on the way from high-temperature to
room-temperature superconductivity in pressurized metallic hydrides. We discuss some key
theoretical ideas and mechanisms proposed for unconventional superconductors (cuprates,
pnictides, chalcogenides, bismuthates, diborides, heavy-fermions, organics, bilayer graphene,
twisted graphene, oxide hetero-structures), superfluids and balanced or imbalanced ultracold
Fermi gases in magnetic traps. We build a bridge between unconventional superconductors and
recently discovered pressurized hydrides superconductors H3S and LaH10 with the critical
temperature close to room temperature. We discuss systems with line of nodal Dirac points close to
the Fermi surface and superconducting shape resonances, and hyperbolic superconducting
networks which are very important for the development of novel topological superconductors, for
the energetics, for the applications in nano-electronics and quantum computations.
Keywords: high-temperature superconductivity, s-wave and d-wave pairing, Kohn–Luttinger and
Migdal–Eliashberg mechanisms, BCS-BEC crossover, Fermi-Bose mixture

1. Introduction
The seminal discovery in 1986 of high-TC superconductivity at 36 K in a doped cuprate
perovskite La2- x BaxCuO4 by K. A. Muller and J. G. Bednorz in IBM Zurich [1,2] determined the
shift of research for room-temperature superconductors from metallic alloys to complex perovskites.
In the first 10 years the critical temperature of gradually increased from 36 K in lanthanum family of
superconducting cuprate perovskites till 90 K in yttrium family YBa2Cu3O7 -d and finally reaching
160 K in

HgBa2Ca2Cu3O8 under a pressure of P = 350 Kbar. This extraordinary progress promised a

technological revolution in electronics, and energetics and provided the driving force for a
tremendous progress in the development of many body theories for condensed matter physics,
inorganic chemistry and material science. Today we see the growing interest on quantum complex
materials. The conventional superconductivity in low-temperature superconductors is described by
the BCS weak coupling theory in a homogeneous metal with pairing on a large Fermi surface with

high Fermi energy. The unconventional high temperature superconductors are characterized by the
breakdown of the standard BCS approximations: 1) a single electronic component, 2) high electron
density and high Fermi energy EF; 3) low values of the ratio w0/EF between the energy cut off of the
attractive interaction w0 and the Fermi energy 4) large Fermi surface and high Fermi momentum kF;
5) superconducting energy gap much smaller than the Fermi energy D << EF; 6) large ratio between
the coherence length x0 and the average distance between electrons.

as a function of the variables

Soon after the discovery of Müller, Anderson and Schrieffer advanced different unconventional
mechanisms for high temperature superconductivity (see e. g. [3, 4, 5]). Many fruitful ideas were
introduced in the first years of HTSC by the leading theorists in USA, Europe, Japan and worldwide
(see e. g. [6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16]). One of the authors of the present review was very active in
unconventional mechanisms focusing on the low density electron systems [17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24]
based on the generalization of Kohn–Luttinger ideas [25,26] in purely repulsive Fermi systems. In
the framework of the Fermi gas model with hard-core repulsion [27], repulsive-U Hubbard model
[28] and the Shubin–Vonsovsky model [29, 30] on different type of 3D and 2D lattices during last 30
years of intensive research we predicted p-, d-, f- and anomalous s-wave pairing in various materials
such as the idealized and bilayer graphene (see Fig. 1), superconducting pnictides and organic
superconductors and superfluid 3He.
It has been shown that the critical temperature of the superconducting transition can be
substantially increased at low densities by considering spin-polarization or the two-band
superconductivity scenario [31,32,33]. These results proved to be very important for related systems
as in polarized 3He - 4He mixtures, imbalanced Fermi-gas in magnetic trap as well as for heavy
fermion superconductors and other mixed valence systems described by the two-band Hubbard
model with one narrow band [34,35,36,37]. Together with T.M. Rice we also considered a
superconductivity scenario in 2D t-J model at low and intermediate electron density [38, 39] with
van der Waals interaction which corresponds to strong onsite Hubbard repulsion and weak intersite
antiferromagnetic (AFM) attraction. The phase-diagram of this model presented in Fig. 2 shows

regions of superconducting phases with different pairing symmetry: p-wave, s-wave and
d 2 2 -pairing. For small values of J / t the phase-diagram of the 2D t-J model becomes equivalent
x -y

to the phase-diagram of the 2D Hubbard model and according to the results [17-19] is unstable at
low electron densities towards p-wave superconductivity of the Kohn-Luttinger [25] type. At large
values of J / t ³ 2 (which usually are not realized in cuprates) the system becomes unstable
towards extended s-wave pairing. For the set electron densities (optimal doping) and the values of
J / t 1/ 2 we get the critical temperature of the d-wave pairing typical for high-TC

(Eq. 1).

This result was generalized by N.M. Plakida et al [40,41] on the opposite case of small hole
densities x = (1 - nel ) 1 using the diagrammatic technique of the Hubbard operators for the
pairing of two spin polarons. The same order of magnitude TC: 100 K for the critical temperature can
be obtained for the d-wave pairing in the Shubin-Vonsovsky model in the intermediate coupling
case for the set of parameters U » 3t , nel » 0.9 [20,21,24] on the 2D square lattice.

We would like to summarize here both the early stage [42-53] and recent [54-58] theoretical
results of the Russian research school in high-TC investigations
The proposed mechanisms of superconductivity in high-TC cuprates range from BCS scenarios
involving electron-phonon or electron-electron interactions, with extended pairs [59] or BEC
scenarios with local pairs [60, 61], with condensates of s-wave or d-wave [4,6,12,8] in models of the
normal phase described by Landau Fermi liquid [62, 63], Luttinger [64] or marginal [13] Fermi liquid
(correspondingly with spinons and holons instead of fermionic quasiparticles), spin-charge
separation [3,6,12,64,65] or spin-charge confinement [11,65], with the presence of pseudogap [66] in
underdoped state, including interplay between superconductivity and antiferromagnetism [67],
formation of stripes [14], the role of the second layer and the c-axis plasmon mode [15] have been
subject of an intensive debate.

In 2015 following theoretical predictions [68, 69] for high Tc in the high pressure metallic phase
H 3 S the record [70] for the superconducting temperature of 203 K was reached. The authors of the
experimental breakthrough claimed that the discovered superconductivity could be explained by e
conventional strong-coupling version of the BCS theory [71] constructed by Migdal and Eliashberg
[72, 73] used to predict the high Tc phase in the dirty limit [69, 70]. It was rapidly shown that by
changing the pressure to reach the maximum critical temperature the chemical potential in H3S is
driven to an electronic topological transition known as a Lifshitz transition for the appearing of a
new piece of a Fermi surface [74,75]. In this regime the Migdal approximation breakdown [76] and it
is not possible to apply the BCS theory to explain the emergence of high temperature
superconductivity. It has been shown that the emergence of high temperature superconductivity in a
multiband scenario near a Lifshitz transition has been described by numerical solution of
Bogoliubov equations [77] and can be qualitatively predicted in the limit of a steep –flat scenario [79]
where the energy dispersion of the appearing band is pushed down to zero as for the case of an
infinite effective mass for strong correlated localized states [78]. An essential point of this proposed
scenario for the emergence of room temperature superconductivity is the theoretical demonstration
that the Lifshitz transition for the appearing of a strongly correlated band is not of 2,5 order but
becomes of first order with appearing of a frustrated phase separation [79], interface
superconducting [80] and a hyperbolic space of filamentary pathways in two dimensional systems
like it was observed in cuprate perovskite superconductors at optimal doping [81].
Recent papers on pressurized hydrides under high pressure support early papers [82] and
support the multigap superconducting scenario in the proximity of a Lifshitz transition [83].
Quite recently two experimental groups [84,85] reported a discovery of even higher critical
temperatures TC: (250–260) K in lanthanum superconducting hydrides LaH10± x at high pressures P:
(170–190) GPa. In this compound according to the Density Functional Theory (DFT) the host atom of
La is at the center of the cage formed by hydrogen atoms. Moreover the authors of [86] on the basis
of numerical calculations predict the topological Dirac nodal line in LaH10 near the Fermi energy EF.
Note that room critical temperatures (RTSC) of the order of 300 K or higher in metallic hydrogen for
very high pressures P: (170–190) Mbar and in hydrogen dominant metallic alloys (at smaller
pressures) were predicted by Ashcroft [87, 88]. The large values of TC in Ashcroft estimates were
facilitated by the high phonon frequencies governed by light mass of hydrogen ions.
Note also that profound numerical calculations of the optimal crystalline structure performed
by Brovman, Yu. Kagan and Kholas [89, 90] show the regions of 3D isotropic phase, quasi-2D planar
phase and quasi-1D filamentary phase on the P–T phase-diagram of metallic hydrogen. In particular
they predict at relatively low pressures and T=0 a strongly anisotropic phase with the proton
filaments embedded in electron liquid. The filaments can move almost freely relative to each other in
the longitudinal direction similar to vortices in superfluid 4He [91] (where we have a vortex crystal
in perpendicular direction to the vortex lines and a free superfluid in parallel direction to the vortex
lines). In the same time the filaments form a rigid triangular lattice in the direction perpendicular to
them which resembles Abrikosov vortex lattice in type-II superconductors [92]. Similarly in the
planar phase the hydrogen layers can move almost freely relative to each other similarly to the
smectic liquid crystals or graphite layers.

2. Superconductivity in the Fermi-Bose mixture model. Theory.
Let us stress that the light mass of hydrogen ions H+ not only guarantees the high values of
Debye frequency but also leads to a large kinetic energy of zero-vibrations and thus to a large value
of DeBoer parameter measuring the ratio of kinetic delocalization energy and potential energy and
responsible for the quantumness of the system [93,39]. This fact brings a highly mobile ionic
subsystem in metallic hydrogen (which resembles superionic crystal but at low temperatures in our

M. Y. Kagan, A. Bianconi Fermi-Bose mixtures and BCS-BEC crossover in high Tc superconductors. arXiv:1905.05419 (2019) 5 of 19

case) close to the limit of the quantum crystal [93,39]. Note that a high mobility of filaments or layers
can promote also rather large values of Lindemann parameter (Lindemann number [93,39]). It
measures the ratio of the root mean square of the displacement of ion to the interionic distance in
metallic hydrogen or in hydrogen dominant alloys and shows that our system is close to the
quantum melting limit. In principle, according to the ideas of Andreev, Lifshitz the ionic lattice of
the quantum crystal can become superfluid at low temperatures (due for example to a flow of
vacancies or other defects relative to the lattice or due to delocalization of fillaments themselves
which can form the macroscopic wave function). This phenomenon is nowadays called a
supersolidity of the quantum crystal [94]. Experimental indications on available today scenarios for
quantum supersolid are discussed by Bianconi group in [81]. The experimental support for
filamentary supersolids can be found in [76, 78] having in mind not only ”new” hydrogen dominant
superconductors but also the “old” cuprate perovskites.

Figure 3. Interplay between Fermi and Bose subsystems in superconducting Ba1-xKxBiO3 [111, 112, 21]: (a)
insulator, x = 0; (b) superconductor, x < 0.37; (c) superconductive metal, x > 0.37; (d) metal, x = 1.

In analogy with neutron stars we can describe the ionic subsystem on the language of biproton
superfluidity which coexists with the BCS Eliashberg superconductivity of the electron subsystem
(probably modified on frequency dependence of effective mass and nonconstant density of states
[95]).
These qualitative considerations press us to consider the superconductivity in metallic
hydrogen on the level of Fermi-Fermi mixture [96] of protons and electrons (as in plasma physics or
in the two components model with one very narrow band [36, 37]) or on the level of Fermi-Bose
mixture of Cooper pairs and protons or even of Bose-Bose mixture [97] of Cooper pairs and
biprotons. Note that the ideas of Fermi-Bose mixture were very fruitful in low temperature physics
describing the search for fermionic (BCS) superfluidity in dilute 3D and 2D solutions of 3He in
superfluid 4He [34,98,99,100] as well as 6 Li - 7 Li or 40 K - 87 Rb mixtures of ultracold atoms
[101,102,103] in restricted geometry of magnetic and dipole traps or on the optical lattices.
Note that in ultracold Fermi gases there is a very effective way to change the magnitude and
the sign of the interaction (more precisely of the s-wave scattering length) between the atoms. This
can be done in the resonance magnetic field, in the regime of Feshbach resonance [104] which is
important for the physics of BCS-BEC crossover in quantum gases. The Fermi-Bose mixture model
corresponds to the two-channel description of the Feshbach resonance [105]. Here we have the
attractive Majorana exchange term which transforms the (extended) Cooper pair consisting of two
fermions in one channel into a real boson (a local pair or dimer) in the other channel.

In the physics of superconductors the model of Fermi-Bose mixture was firstly proposed by T.
D. Lee et al. [106] and Micnas et al. [107]. for superconducting cuprates. In this model the Majorana
exchange term which transforms the Cooper pair in a boson, is present. Later on Larkin,
Geshkenbein and Ioffe [108] phenomenologically advanced this model on the level of
Ginzburg–Landau theory [109] for 2D electron system described by Hubbard type models close to
van Hove singularities and for two-leg ladder systems [110].
Note that the Fermi-Bose mixture model with an additional requirement of the spatial
separation of Fermion and Boson component captures thermodynamic and transport properties as
well as a lot of essential features on the phase diagram of superconducting bismuth oxides
Ba1-xKxBiO3 [111,112]. The local pairs are formed in these materials in BiO6 clusters (see Fig. 1). The
critical temperature

TC

36 K corresponds here to the coherent tunneling of local pairs between

neighboring Bose clusters through the effective barriers formed by Fermi clusters.
The generic Hamiltonian of the Fermi-Bose mixture typically has the form

H = H F + H B + H BF

(Eq.2)

where fermionic and bosonic parts

HF , HB

are Hubbard like and interaction term has a form

resembling electron-phonon interaction.
In the second order of perturbation theory an interaction term also becomes Hubbard-like [102]

H FB = U FB å niF niB

(Eq.3)

and depending upon the sign of

U FB

describes either Fermi-Bose mixture with repulsion [34]

or with attraction [103] between fermions and bosons.
The Fermi-Bose mixture of spinons and holons interacting via a strong confinement potential
[8,65] created by an AFM string [113,114] was considered in [115] for the underdoped high TC
cuprates. The main idea was to describe the superconducting pairing in the strongly underdoped
region of the t-J model on the language of the BCS-BEC crossover for the pairing in the d-wave
channel of two spin polarons (two composite holes or two strings), where the critical temperature in
the BCS phase is governed by (Eq. 1) and its spin-polaronic generalization [40,41]. The crossover
however is probably not smooth, containing quantum critical point (QCP) or even intermediate
phases in between BCS and BEC phase [115].
Note that non-phonon mechanisms of superconductivity can easily explain superconductivity
with the critical temperatures Tc=100 K typical for cuprate perovskites. However to get TC: (250–260)
K typical for metallic hydrogen alloys another type of models such as Fermi-Bose mixture model or
the Fano shape resonance mechanism with exchange interaction between a first BCS and a second
condensate in the BCS-BEC crossover regime model is needed.

3. The 3D and 2D models of BCS-BEC crossover.
Note that to some extent the Femi-Bose mixture model naturally appears in the most difficult
intermediate part of the phase diagram for the BCS-BEC crossover [116,21] between extended
Cooper pairs (dilute BEC regime) and local pairs (or bipolarons [117,118]) which correspond to the
weakly repulsive Bogoliubov gas [119] of composed bosons (see Fig. 4).

Figure 4. The typical phase-diagram of BCS-BEC crossover between extended Cooper pairs and
local pairs in the 3D Fermi gas [116, 21].

Namely for the dilute Bose gas we have two distinct temperatures T * which corresponds to the
formation of local pairs and TC of their Bose-condensation. For intermediate temperatures:

(Eq. 5)

is mostly governed by Einstein formula [120] for the number of pairs density
mass of the pair

nB = n / 2 and the

mB = 2m .However there are nontrivial corrections to Einstein results connected

with weakly repulsive interaction between the local pairs (between the dimers) [121]. This
interaction is defined by the dimer-dimer scattering length a2-2 = 0.6 | a |> 0 [122,123], where a is
an s-wave scattering length for particle-particle interaction. In the same time the crossover (Saha)

where

f 2- 2

1/ ln(1.6 | Eb | / EF ) [129] describes the repulsive interaction between the dimers in

2D.
For the intermediate temperatures in (Eq. 4) we have a new state of matter, namely the normal
(non-superconducting) metal. According to [126, 127] it has very peculiar transport and
thermodynamic properties with a resistivity behaving in semiconducting fashion R µ T .
In the same time in the intermediate coupling case (for the values of the gas parameter
1 £ apF £ 3 [21]) the binding energy of the pair | Eb | becomes comparable with the Fermi-energy
EF. When we increase the density we finally reach the limit

| Eb |£ 2 EF , and the local pairs start to

touch each other. As a result some of the local pairs are crushed and (in the framework of e.g. 3D
Fermi gas with attraction or attractive-U Hubbard model) we have a Fermi-Bose mixture of paired
and unpaired electrons already at low temperatures.
With some precaution we can also describe the low temperature phase in case of intermediate
coupling on the language of the Bose-Bose mixture of two coexisting Bose condensates one in the
limit of extended pairs and a second one in the limit of almost local pairs.

4. Fano resonaces in multigap BCS-BEC superconductivity at Lifshitz transitions
Major schools of unconventional mechanisms for high temperature superconductivity have been
based on the assumption of a “single electronic component” forming the superconducting
condensate. The resonant valence bond theory proposed the condensation of preformed electronic
pairs in a doped Mott insulator [3], the spin fluctuation theory proposed the pairing mediated by
spin fluctuations in a strongly correlated metal [4]. The conventional BCS theory as well consider a
single electronic component both in the weak coupling as well as in the strong coupling limit. In
these standard theories the superconductor is formed by a single quantum condensate. In order to
apply the BCS theory to a large variety of superconductors the complex band structure of metals
with multiple Fermi surfaces is reduced to a single band theory using the “dirty limit
approximation”. However these “standard theories” have been falsified by the results of material
science which has found high temperature superconductivity not in simple elemental metals which
can be reduced to a single electronic component in a single Fermi surface but in complex
multi-components materials with coexistence of multiple distinguishable electronic components
with different orbital symmetries at the Fermi level with multiple different Fermi surfaces going
from A15 intermetallics, doped cuprate perovskites, diborides, iron based superconductors,
pressurized hydrides. In these systems different pairs in multiple portions of the Fermi surfaces
condense in a single macroscopic coherent quantum state formed by multiple superconducting
quantum condensates with different symmetries. While “exchange interaction” between quantum
condensates is not considered and neglected in standard theories of superconductivity it becomes a
key ingredient in multigap superconductors. The role of exchange interaction in the formation of a
quantum heterogeneous matter made of different components was first faced in quantum mechanics
in theories proposed to explain the formation of nuclear matter made by protons and neutrons.
The attractive exchange interaction between bosonic pairs of protons and bosonic pairs of neutrons
in Quantum Mechanics was proposed in 1933 by Majorana [130,131] after Heisenberg proposed the
well known repulsive exchange interaction [132-133] between fermionic particles. Majorana
demonstrated that symmetry played a vital role in bosonic or fermionic systems. In fact his force and
the one of Heisenberg made very different predictions because of their different symmetry

M. Y. Kagan, A. Bianconi Fermi-Bose mixtures and BCS-BEC crossover in high Tc superconductors. arXiv:1905.05419 (2019) 9 of 19

properties. The Majorana exchange interaction opened the road map for both the interaction boson
model [134] and the interaction boson fermion model [135], and today it is at the base of the research
to extract simplicity in complexity applied to a large spectrum of systems where the focus of the
research is to identify the dynamical complex symmetry [136] as shown in Figure 5 for the triangular
hyperbolic tiling, and it was extended to the case of high temperature superconductors with
multiple gaps [137] and in molecular systems. It is now clear that more complex is the system ,the
more important is to search for its symmetry as for example in the vibron model described by the
so-called(4)u algebra and in the electron-vibron model described by even more complicated
superalgebra (4 / )u1 [136].

Figure 5. Tessellation of the hyperbolic Poincare’ plane: showing the (6,4,2) triangular hyperbolic tiling (left
side) that inspired the Escher Circle limit III panting (right side) (From M.C. Escher, Circle Limit III, 1959).

Fano introduced the configuration interaction between a closed channel and an open scattering
channel in Quantum Mechanics in his famous paper published by Nuovo Cimento in 1935 [138]. He
expanded and improved his theory in the 1961 Physical Review paper [139]. The idea of exchange
interaction between pairs formed in the cloud of fermionic particles (which he called “pions”) and a
localized boson, an extension of Fano resonance, was developed in the quantum field theory of
many body systems by Tomonaga [140]. The Fano resonances have been classified as a “Feshbach
resonance” if scattering length of the system in the closed channel is negative and it gives a well
localized boson pair at negative energy; or as a “shape resonance” if the scattering length of the system
in the closed channel is positive and it is a quasi-stationary state at positive energy degenerate with the
continuum [141].
The Bose fermion or Fermi-Bose model for high temperature superconductors is therefore
described as the case of Feshbach resonance driven by Majorana exchange interaction between bosonic
pairs making a BEC condensate with cooper pairs making a BCS condensate [142-144] which is
described in the right panel of figure 6.
In 1993 an alternative theoretical scenario for high temperature superconductors driven by a
Fano resonances of the type called shape resonances [77,80,145-150] was proposed. where the
Majorana exchange term is in action between a cooper pairs in the BCS condensate and the second
condensate of polaronic pairs in the intermediate coupling regime forming a condensate in the
BCS-BEC crossover which is described in the central panel of figure 6. The theoretical proposal was
based on compelling experimental evidence collected from the study of the structure of the 91K
Bi2Sr2CaCuO8+y superconductor that bulk superconductivity emerges in a stack of 2D layers of a
strongly correlated electron liquid confined in finite domains of incommensurate modulated
aperiodic lattice where two electronic components coexist: a first Fermi liquid and a second
polaronic liquid coexisting with a polaronic generalized Wigner charge density wave [145-147].
The “shape resonance driven by Majorana exchange interaction between a first condensate in the
BCS-BEC crossover and cooper pairs in a BCS condensate appears by tuning the chemical potential

M. Y. Kagan, A. Bianconi Fermi-Bose mixtures and BCS-BEC crossover in high Tc superconductors. arXiv:1905.05419 (2019) 10 of 19

to the electronic topological transition called Lifshitz transition in a correlated interacting low
dimensional metal [148-150]. This non-standard and unconventional superconductivity scenario is
completely beyond all BCS approximations and it was described theoretically by solving
numerically the Bogoliubov anisotropic gaps equations at the same time as the density equation,
called Bianconi-Perali-Valletta (BPV) approach [77, 80,148-150].

Figure 6. Three typical cases of non-standard superconducting theories of multigap superconductivity
where Majorana exchange interaction between two different electronic components with different symmetry
plays a key role: left, the case of two BCS condensates in two large Fermi surfaces; center: the case of Fano shape
resonance between a first BCS condensate and a second condensate in the BCS/BEC crossover, right: the case of
Feshbach resonance between a first BCS condensate and a second condensate in the BEC regime typical of the
boson-fermion models.

The BPV theory predicts that the critical temperature is a strong function of the physical
parameters like strain, doping, pressure, uniaxial pressure, charge density, gate voltage etc. which
tune the system near the Lifshitz transition with a strongly anisotropic resonance of the
superconducting critical temperature and the superconducting gap with Fano line-shape not
predicted by standard single band theories.
The “shape resonance” superconducting phase in proximity of two Lifshitz transitions is
supported in cuprates by the fact that the maximum critical temperature occurs at optimum doping
d=0.16 where the Fermi surface is made of disconnected Fermi arcs in the proximity of two
topological electronic transitions. The first one is at d=0.21 where for larger doping a large circular
Fermi surface appears and the second for d=0.125 where the Fermi surface shrinks to only four very
short Fermi arcs in the (p,p) direction with a maximum isotope coefficient [150]. Complexity
emerged in the beginning of the XXI century, as the second key universal feature of cuprate
superconducting perovskites [151-153]. Three key features of high temperature superconductors
were established: i) mesoscopic and nanoscale phase separation [151(see also review article [154]), ii)
multiple electronic components in the normal metallic phase [152], iii) the key role of anisotropic
lattice strain driving the complexity [153] and coexisting multiple superconducting gaps spatially
distributed at nanoscale. The phase separation scenario with spin, charge, lattice nanoscale puddles
with the proliferation of interface filamentary space was called a Superstripes scenario i.e., a
supersolid with a specific symmetry [155] (see also Fig. 6 for illustration).
The BPV theory was presented at the first Stripes conference in 1996, before the discovery of
superfluid condensation of ultracold bosonic gases in 1998 and the superfluid condensation of
fermionic gasses in 2002 driven by the Feshbach resonance mechanism. At the Rome Stripes
conference in 2000 the key role of anisotropic misfit-strain and the strain-doping-temperature phase
diagram in the proximity of a Lifshitz transition have been presented. Few month later in Dec 2000
the superconducting properties of MgB2, a binary metallic non-magnetic system known since fifty
years, have been measured in Japan by Akimitsu. MgB2 was a layered system not expected to be a
BCS superconductor, showing the record of Tc=40K for a binary alloy. It was rapidly claimed that it
was a clear case of superconductivity driven by a Fano shape resonance near a Lifshitz transition for
the appearing of a new spot of a sigma Fermi surface with the key role of a large amplitude zero

point motion at low temperature [156-157]. The BPV model predicted and provided the first
published explanation of the high critical temperature in diborides where the misfit strain and
doping moves the chemical potential in the Al1-x MgxB2 and Sc1-x MgxB2 below the Lifshitz transition
for the appearing the sigma Fermi surface for x>0.5 [156]. It was the first case of a verified prediction
of the BPV theory in a completely different system [148-150]. The second key feature, nanoscale phase
separation, was found by doping MgB2 with aluminum or scandium substitution for Mg [158] which
shifts the chemical potential toward the Lifshitz transition.

Figure 7. Superstripes landscape made of nanoscale striped puddles with a power law size distribution where the
pathways of interface superconductivity connecting two points (where superconducting pairs shown in the figure) can be
mapped to a hyperbolic space [81,155,175,176] providing a case of supersolid [39, 94] driven by strain and doping [152,153]
near a critical point of a Lifshitz transition and of large zero point lattice fluctuations [151,155,157].

The second case of a different practical realization of the Fano shape resonance high temperature
superconducting was reported in 2008 with the discovery of iron based superconductors [159-162] which are
stacks of superconducting iron layers which show a strain doping phase diagram with maximum critical
temperature in proximity of a Lifshitz transition [159-162].
After 2008 new microscopes using focused synchrotron radiation have shown an ubiquitous presence of
nanoscale phase separation in high temperature superconductors in cuprates [81, 163-165] and in iron based
superconductors [166-169] providing the theoretical prediction that nanoscale phase separation is an universal
feature of systems showing Fano shape resonances in proximity of a Lifshitz transition [170-172] in the
superstripes scenario [155] which is called by some authors with the generic name of intertwined or nematic
phase. The theoretical efforts to understand the nanoscale phase separation in high temperature
superconductors has pointed out the complexity of possible variable tilting of local structure in perovskites
[171], the mixing of boson and fermions in the complex symmetry [172,173], the role of anisotropic pseudo-Jahn
Teller vibronic interaction in the polaron formation [174] of these materials with the most recent results pointing
out the role of a non-euclidean hyperbolic space (see Fig, 7) for the filamentary network at the interfaces of
striped puddles in high temperature superconductivity [81,175-176].
Conclusions

In conclusion let us stress that recently discovered superconductivity in bilayer twisted graphene
possibly also corresponds to the regime of BCS-BEC crossover between local and extended pairs in
the d-wave channel (similarly to underdoped cuprates) but with anomalous chiral
superconductivity of d+id type [177] which is in agreement with the phase diagram for idealized
bilayer graphene in AB modification at low doping levels [20,22,23]. The discovery of
superconductivity in graphene with many properties resembling the cuprates helps us to build the
bridge between low temperature topological superconductors based on graphene [177] and bismuth
[178-180] and vanadium oxides [181-184] which are very promising for superconducting
nanoelectronics and quantum calculations (for creation of topologically protected qubits). The band
structure calculations and recent experimental results show the evidence for multigap
superconductivity in pressurized H3S hydrides as well as in the recently discovered
high-temperature superconductor LaH10 [84,85,86] where the superconducting dome occurs
around the Lifshitz transition driven by pressure. Here the key role of Majorana exchange

interaction driving the Fano shape resonance involve the new appearing small Fermi surface spots
with strong pairing interactions where a strongly interacting set of states in the generalized
strong-coupling approach predicted by the model of hydrogen bonds [185] is very important for
hydrogen containing compounds. The evidence of shape resonance involving multiple set of
electronic states in the strong coupling regimes has been stimulating a renewed interest to doped
copper perovskites where the Hubbard models including multiple components showing a
coexistence of coherent quasiparticles, incoherent states and stripe order with nondispersive
quasiparticles close to the Fermi energy [186,187]. Finally the physics of XXI century is reaching a
universal understanding of the emergence of quantum coherence of high temperature which could
be manipulated by controlling the formation of hyperbolic quantum geometries in a nanoscale phase
separation superstripes scenario (see Fig.7) with interacting networks of multiple components
[81,155,175,176,188] by self organization of local structural tilts [171], the polaronic interaction [189],
the zero point motion [74-76] and the mobile dopants [163,190], controlled by anisotropic strain
[153,159,189] in quantum complex materials which can be observed by novel methods using a
scanning sub-micron x-ray beam of focused synchrotron radiation [163].
In conclusion the maximum superconducting critical temperature has been seen to be reached at
near a Lifhsitz transition with a quantum condensate in the new appearing small Fermi surface is in
the BCS-BEC crossover predicted since 1996 [145-149] was first verified in MgB2 in 2001 (191,192).
The key role of Feshbach resonance driven by Majorana exchange interaction to stabilize the
quantum condensates was later confirmed also by the realization of a quasi pure BEC condensate in
fermionic ultracold gases driven by Feshbach resonance [193] the physical properties of a quantum
condensate in the BCS-BEC crossover in a single band case has been discussed for the case

of ultracold gases [194]. Following the evidence for the experimental realization of the transition of
Feshbach resonances in ultracold fermionic gases from negative to positive scattering length [195] in the regime
of superconducting Fano shape resonances as in magnesium diboride [156-158], the theoretical interest focused
in the BCS-BEC crossover first for a single electronic component [196] and recently for two electronic
components [197].
