SIERPINSKI GASKET
SHIPING CAO, SHUANGPING LI, ROBERT S. STRICHARTZ, AND PREM TALWAI
Abstract. We give a discrete characterization of the trace of a class
of Sobolev spaces on the Sierpinski gasket to the bottom line. This
includes the L2 domain of the Laplacian as a special case. In addition,
for Sobolev spaces of low orders, including the domain of the Dirichlet
form, the trace spaces are Besov spaces on the line.

1. Introduction
This work deals with the restriction problem for functions in Sobolev
spaces on the Sierpinski gasket (SG) to the bottom line. A special case was
studied by A. Jonsson in [14], where the trace for the Dirichlet form was
characterized.

Consider the standard Dirichlet form (E, domE) on SG. This form was
studied in connection with the Brownian motion on SG (see [1, 15, 22]), and
was constructed in a pure analytically approach by J. Kigami in [17, 18]. A.
Jonsson showed the following theorem.

The above theorem was extended to a wide class of self-similar sets [7],
where the trace theorem for Dirichlet forms to self-similar subsets were established. Also, read [7, 20] for an application of the trace theorems to
penetrating processes.
Recently, many related works emerge, including the trace theorem on the
middle line of SG (see [5, 21]), and boundary value problems on the upper
half domain of SG (see [3, 6, 12, 23]). However, there have not been further
results telling us what is the trace of the domain of the Lapalcian and other
Sobolev spaces on SG to I. In this work, we will give an answer to the above
question.
Below, we briefly introduce our results. We choose
P µ to be the Hausdoff
measure on SG, satisfying µ(SG) = 1 and µ(A) = 2i=0 13 µ(Fi−1 A) for each
Borel set A. For u ∈ domE, we say u ∈ domL2 ∆(SG) with ∆u = f if
Z
E(u, v) = −
f vdµ
SG

holds for each v ∈ dom0 E := {v ∈ domE : v(qi ) = 0, for i = 0, 1, 2}. In our
work, we consider Sobolev spaces L2σ (SG) with 0 ≤ σ ≤ 2, which can be
defined as follows.
Definition 1.2. Define the Sobolev space L20 (SG) = L2 (SG) with norm
kukL20 (SG) = kukL2 (SG) , and define L22 (SG) = domL2 ∆(SG) with norm kuk2L2 (SG) =
2

kuk2L2 (SG) + k∆uk2L2 (SG) .
For 0 ≤ σ ≤ 2, we define Sobolev spaces to be L2σ (SG) = [L20 (SG), L22 (SG)]σ/2 ,
where [X, Y ]θ denotes the complex interpolation space of X, Y .
In [26], Strichartz gave systematic discussions on Sobolev spaces and other
function spaces, where Sobolev spaces were defined in more general settings.
Related works on properites of Sobolev spaces can be found in [2, 5, 9, 10,
11, 13]. Also read [8, 24] for recent developments on p−Laplacian and the
corresponding Lp Sobolev spaces.
In our first main result, we have two critical orders

domE (see [5]) is included as a special case, the following Theorem 1.3 can
be viewed as a direct extension of Jonsson’s theorem.
Theorem 1.3. Let b1 < σ < b2 and α = α(σ). Then L2σ (SG)|I = Bα2,2 (I).
b1 in the above theorem is the critical order for the continuity of functions
in Sobolev spaces (see [2, 9, 26]), and one can check α(b1 ) = 12 , the well
known critical order for Sobolev spaces on the line. The complicated upper
bound b2 has an explanation in Corollary 3.3, where the trace of harmonic
functions is studied.
On the other hand, Besov spaces on the line segment are no longer the
trace spaces of Sobolev spaces for higher orders. To describe the trace
spaces, we will define a difference operator D. To be more precise, we define
Df (n, k) to be a linear combination of the values of f ∈ C(I) at 2kn and
some neighbouring points. The space Tσ will be discretely characterized as
n

Tσ = f ∈ C(I) :

Details can be found in Definition 3.5 and 4.5. We will prove the following
trace theorem.
Theorem 1.4. Let b1 < σ ≤ 2. Then L2σ (SG)|I = Tσ .
As supplement, we will show that Bα2,2 (I) ⊂ Tσ for b1 < σ <

log 6
log 5 (≈

1.11328), and Bα2,2 (I) = Tσ for b1 < σ < b2 . In addition, Tσ is stable under
complex interpolation.
In the end, we briefly introduce the structure of this paper. In section
2, we will review the Dirichlet form and harmonic functions on SG, and
introduce some notations and tools. In section 3, we will prove Theorem
1.3. Some preparations for Theorem 1.4 will be included. In section 4, we
will construct the trace space Tσ , and prove Theorem 1.4. In Section 5, we
will talk about some related results.
Throughout the paper, we always use the notation f . g if there is a
constant C > 0 such that f ≤ Cg, and write f  g if f . g and g . f .
Also, we will keep using the critical numbers b1 , b2 and the function α(σ)
without further specifying.
2. The Dirichlet form and harmonic functions
For convenience of readers, we briefly reivew the Dirichlet form and the
harmonic functions on SG in this section. Some easy lemmas and important
tools will also be given. More details can be found in books [19, 25].
Recall that SG is the attractor of the i.f.s {Fi }2i=0 , i.e.
SG =

[
i=0

Fi SG.

4

SHIPING CAO, SHUANGPING LI, ROBERT S. STRICHARTZ, AND PREM TALWAI

We call each Fi SG a level-1 cell. More generally, define Wn = {0, 1, 2}n
for n ≥ 1, and set W
S0 = {∅} for uniformity. For each finite word w =
w1 w2 · · · wn ∈ W ∗ = ∞
m=0 Wm , we denote |w| = n the length of the word,
and write Fw = Fw1 Fw2 · · · Fwn for short. In particular, F∅ = Id is the
identity map. We call Fw SG a level-n cell if |w| = n.
We call V0 = {q0 , q1 , q2 } theSset of boundary vertices of SG, and define
the set of level-n vertices Vn = w∈Wn Fw V0 . For convenience, for n ≥ 1, let
Ṽn = Vn \ Vn−1 ,
F∞
S
and set Ṽ0 = V0 . The set of vertices V∗ = ∞
n=0 Ṽn is a dense
n=0 Vm =
subset of SG.
On SG, J. Kigami [17, 18] constructed the self-similar energy form by
defining it as the limit of a sequence of discrete Dirichlet forms on Vn . For
each u ∈ l(Vn ), define
X X
5
En (u) = ( )n
(u(Fw qi ) − u(Fw qj ))2 .
3
w∈Wn i6=j

{En (u)} is a nondecreasing sequence for each u ∈ C(SG), so we can define
E(u) = lim En (u). Set domE = {u ∈ C(SG) : E(u) < ∞}. For u, v ∈ domE,
n→∞
we can use polarization to give a bilinear form

1
E(u, v) = E(u + v) − E(u − v) .
4
It is well known that (E, domE) is a local regular Dirichlet form on SG with
the Hausdoff measure µ.
Given any boundary value h0 ∈ l(V0 ), there is a unique extension h1 ∈
l(V1 ) that minimizes the energy E1 , i.e. E1 (h1 ) = min{E1 (u) : u ∈ l(V1 ), u|V0 =
h0 }. The extension algorithm is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2. The harmonic function with h(q0 ) = a, h(q1 ) =

The above algorithm is local, which means it can be applied to each cell.
So we get a sequence of extensions hn ∈ l(Vn ) that minimize the energy En ,
and hn converges to h ∈ domE. See [25] for details. h is called a harmonic

function, and we denote by H0 the space of harmonic functions on SG.
Clearly, H0 is of three dimension, since each harmonic function is uniquely
determined by its boundary values. The following lemma can be derived
from direct computation.
Lemma 2.1. Let h be a harmonic funciton on SG. For n ≥ 2 and 1 ≤ k ≤
2n−1 , we have
(

5 h( 2n ) + 25 h( 2n ) − 25 h( 2n ), if k is even.

where 0 = q1 , 1 = q2 , 21 = F1 q2 , 14 = F12 q2 and 43 = F22 q1 as we set in
equation (1.1). For larger n, we can do the same computation locally on the
level-(n − 2) cell containing 2k−1
2n . Then, it is direct to check the lemma. 
Analogously to the definition of harmonic functions, for each m ≥ 1 and
x ∈ Ṽm = Vm \ Vm−1 , we can define the tent function ϕx by giving the initial
value on Vm as follows
(
0, if y 6= x,
ϕx (y) =
1, if y = x,
and taking harmonic extension in SG \ Vm . Clearly, ϕx is harmonic in each
level-m cell, and Lemma 2.1 holds for ϕx when n ≥ m + 2.
In our work, we will use the following characterization of Sobolev spaces.

3. An extension of A. Jonsson’s Theorem
In this section, we study the trace theorem for Sobolev spaces of low orders. The result, Theorem 1.3, is a direct extension of A. Jonsson’s trace
theorem. In the following, we will study the restriction map and the extension map seperately. The two parts together imply Theorem 1.3.

6

3.1. A restriction theorem. In this part, we follow A. Jonsson’s idea to
show a restriction theorem. Recall the fact from [16] that for 12 < α < 1, a
function f belong to Bα2,2 (I) if and only if the following expression

is finite and the norm of f in Bα2,2 (I) is equivalent to this expression.
We introduce the following notation to shorten the above expression.
Definition 3.1. Let f ∈ C(I). Define An (f ) to be a vector of length 2n ,
such that

An (f )k = f ( n ) − f ( n ), ∀1 ≤ k ≤ 2n .

Theorem 3.4. Let b1 < σ < b2 and α = α(σ). Then, the restriction map u
to u|I is continuous L2σ (SG) → Bα2,2 (I).

3.2. An extension theorem. In the rest of this section, we develop an
extension map as the right inverse of the restriction map. It suffices to
modify A. Jonsson’s idea. However, we provide another extension map here,
as preparation for further developments in Section 4.
We introduce some new notations here.

Notation. (a). Let Un = Vn ∩ I, Ũn = Ṽn ∩ I and U∗ = V∗ ∩ I. Clearly,
U∗ is the set of dyadic rationals on I.
(b). For each pair (n, k) where n ≥ 0 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n , let w(n, k) be the
unique word in {1, 2}n such that

For example, Fw(n,1) = 11 · · · 1, and Fw(n,2n ) = 22 · · · 2.
(c). Let x(n,k) = Fw(n,k) q0 , and define N Un = {x(n,k) : 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n }. See

With the above definitions and notations, we introduce the following space

Definition 3.6. (a). Let f ∈ C(I). For n ≥ 1 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n , define

by Lemma 2.1. As a consequence, we have

Summing over the above estimate, we get u|I ∈ T̃σ . Obviously ku|I kL2 (I) ≤
ku|I kL∞ (I) . kukL2σ (SG) , so the restriction map is continuous.
Next, we show Ẽ is the desired extension map. It is not hard to see that
1
D̃ϕx(n0 ,k0 ) (n, k) = δn0 n δk0 k ,
5
where δij denotes the Kronecker delta. As a consequence,


D̃ (Ẽf )|I (n, k) = cx(n,k) = D̃f (n, k).
5
In addition, Ẽf (0) = h(0) = f (0), Ẽf ( 21 ) = h( 12 ) = f ( 12 ) and Ẽf (1) =
h(1) = f (1). Combining the above observations, we conclude (Ẽf )|I = f .
It is easy to check the continuity of Ẽ with Theorem 2.2.

The following lemma shows the relationship between two spaces T̃σ and
Bα2,2 (I).
Lemma 3.8. Let α = α(σ). For b1 < σ <

log 6
log 5 ,

we have Bα2,2 (I) ⊂ T̃σ ; for

b1 < σ < b2 , we have T̃σ = Bα2,2 (I).
6
Proof. It is clear that Bα2,2 (I) ⊂ T̃σ for b1 < σ < log
log 5 , as

On the other hand, by Theorem 3.4 and Proposition 3.7, we have T̃σ =
L2σ (SG)|I ⊂ Bα2,2 (I) for b1 < σ < b2 .

Remark. One can check that the linear function f (t) = t on I is not in
6
T̃σ for σ ≥ log
log 5 . So the bound for the range of σ in Lemma 3.8 is sharp.
Combining Proposition 3.7 and Lemma 3.8, we get the extension theorem
as follows.

Theorem 3.9. Let b1 < σ < b2 and α = α(σ). The extension map Ẽ is a
continuous map from Bα2,2 (I) to L2σ (SG) such that (Ẽf )|I = f .
4. A trace theorem for higher order
In Section 3, we developed an extension of A. Jonsson’s theorem. However, for Sobolev spaces of higher orders, the Besov spaces are no longer
the trace spaces. In this section, we work on a discrete characterization of
L2σ (SG)|I for b1 < σ ≤ 2. This includes L22 (SG) = domL2 ∆(SG) as a special case. We still study the restriction theorem and the extension theorem

The idea of the following lemma and Lemma 4.7 can be found in [4],
where pointwise approximations of Laplacians were discussed.
Lemma 4.1. There exist J, J 0 ∈ C(SG) such that for each u ∈ domL2 ∆(SG)
and n ≥ 0, 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n , we have

Proof. First, by the Riesz representation theorem on Hilbert spaces, we
can find J ∈ dom0 E such that D̃v(1, 1) = −E(v, J) for each v ∈ dom0 E.
Define u0 = u − h, where h is the unique harmonic function that h|V0 =
u|V0 . Using the weak formula of the Laplacian and the fact that D̃(h|I )(1, 1) =
0, we get the following desired formula

A same idea works for D̃u(1, 2). The lemma then follows by scaling.

Lemma 4.2. The restriction map R : L2σ (K) → T̃σ is a continuous linear
map for b1 < σ ≤ 2.
Proof. It suffices to prove the argument for 1 ≤ σ ≤ 2. First, for σ = 1,
it is an immediate consequence of Theorem 3.4 and Lemma 3.8.

For general 1 ≤ σ ≤ 2, we can use complex interpolation to deduce the
lemma.

However, T̃2 is actually a larger space than the trace space of L
 2 (SG).

For example, we will see in Corollary 3.3 that ϕx |I ∈ T̃2 \ L2 (SG)|I , where
ϕx is a tent function.
Recall that on SG, for a function u ∈ C(SG), we define the normal derivative at a boundary point to be

The definition can be localized to any vertex in V∗ by scaling, and we use

Inspired by the above observation, we need to include the information of
matching condition into the desired trace space.

which means we additionally require the matching condition on T̃σ . In addition, for small σ, the two spaces coincide as stated by the following lemma.
Lemma 4.6. For b1 < σ < b2 , we have Tσ = T̃σ .
Proof. By the above remark and using Lemma 3.8, we can easily check

Tσ ⊂ T̃σ = Bα2,2 (I) ⊂ Tσ , where α = α(σ).
Lemma 4.6 can be polished, see Corollary 4.11. Parellel to Lemma 4.1,
we have the following lemma 4.7.
Lemma 4.7. There exists J1 , J2 ∈ C(SG) such that for each u ∈ domL2 ∆(SG)

Let ũ = u − h on F1 SG ∪ F2 SG, where h is harmonic on F1 SG ∪ F2 SG with
boundary values h(q1 ) = u(q1 ), h(F0 q1 ) = u(F0 q1 ), h(F0 q2 ) = u(F0 q2 ) and
h(q2 ) = u(q2 ). We can find J0 on F1 SG ∪F2 SG such that EF1 SG∪F2 SG (ũ, J) =

Take J1 = 53 J0 ◦ F1 and J2 = 53 J0 ◦ F2 , then we get the desired equation for
D(u|I )(2, 2). For general cases, we only need to use scaling.

Following a same proof of Lemma 4.2, we finally get the following restriction theorem.
Theorem 4.8. The restriction map R : L2σ (K) → Tσ is a continuous linear
map for b1 < σ ≤ 2.
Proof. For b1 < σ < b2 , the result is an easy consequence of Lemma 4.6
and Proposition 3.7. For σ = 2, the result follows from a similar estimate
as the proof of Lemma 4.2, using Lemma 4.7 and Lemma 4.2. The theorem
then follows by using complex interpolation.

modifying Ẽ.

Combining Theorem 4.8 and 4.10, we finally get Theorem 1.4. Also,
the following corollary shows the relationship of the different traces spaces
discussed in this paper.
Corollary 4.11. Let α = α(σ). Then we have the following relationships.

Proof. (a) is immediately from Lemma 3.8, Proposition 3.7 and Theorem
1.4.
(b). Using complex interpolation, the restriction map maps from L2(1−θ)σ1 +θσ2 (SG)
to [Tσ1 , Tσ2 ]θ , and the extension map maps from [Tσ1 , Tσ2 ]θ to L2(1−θ)σ1 +θσ2 (SG).

Thus T(1−θ)σ1 +θσ2 = L2(1−θ)σ1 +θσ2 (SG)|I = [Tσ1 , Tσ2 ]θ .
5. Related observations and further questions
In this last section, we provide some related results and question that
worth further study.
Another space that we are interested in is
domL∞ ∆(SG) = {u ∈ domE : ∆u ∈ L∞ (SG)}.
With a same method as in the last section, we can derive the following result.
Theorem 5.1. Define
T2∞ = {f ∈ C(SG) : sup

sup

5n |Df (n, k)| < ∞}.

n≥2 1≤k≤2n −1

Then, domL∞ ∆(SG)|I = T2∞ .
Consider the symmetric derivative of the functions. Let f ∈ C(I) and
fix x ∈ Um \ U0 , we define δn f (x) = f (x − 21n ) − 2f (x) + f (x + 21n ). The
symmetric derivative at x is defined to be the renormalized limit of δn f (x),
fs00 (x) = lim 4n δn f (x).
n→∞

Proposition 5.2. Let u ∈ domL∞ ∆(SG) and f = u|I . Then for all x ∈
U∗ \ {0, 1}, we have gs00 (x) = 0.
Proof. Let x = 2kn for some n ≥ 1 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n − 1. By direct
computation and using Theorem 5.1, we have
1
8
1
|δm+1 f (x) − δm f (x)| = | Df (m + 1, 2m+1−n k)| ≤ c( )m−n ,
5
5
5
where c is a constant depends on k∆uk∞ . Summing over the above estimate,
we get
1
1
|δm f − ( )m−n+1 δn+1 f | ≤ c(m − n − 1)( )m−n .
5
5
As an immediate consequence, we get fs00 (x) = limm→∞ 4m δm f (x) = 0. 
On the other hand, δn f (x) should not converge uniformly to 0 in general
cases. Since otherwise, it would imply that f ∈ dom∆(I) with ∆f = 0,
which means f is a linear function. In fact, the following result shows that
f 0 (x) = lim 2n (f (x) − f (x + 21n )) diverges when ∂n→ u(x) 6= 0.
n→∞

We are also interested in Sobolev spaces of higher orders. We believe that
a similar idea would work, but more complicated differences will occur in the
discrete characterization. For example, for 1 < σ ≤ 2, we will need to study
extension algorithm of biharmonic functions, and find suitable difference
operators. The computations are getting messy, so we do not go further in
this direction. Hopefully, readers may get new ideas dealing with this.
Readers may have noticed that b2 plays the important role in that it is
the highest index that Bα2,2 (I) ⊃ L2σ (SG)|I for each α < α(b2 ) as long as
σ ≥ α(b2 ). Noticing that b2 is uniquely characterized by harmonic functions,
we wonder whether biharmonic functions play similarly important roles in
higher order cases. It is also of interest to find the largest index α such that
h|I lies in Bα2,2 (I) for multi-harmonic functions, and what kind of role these
indexes will play. We hope to find a systematic way to deal with these.
