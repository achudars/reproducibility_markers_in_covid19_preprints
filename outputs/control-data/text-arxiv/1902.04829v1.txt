MASS-CONSERVING SELF-SIMILAR SOLUTIONS TO
COAGULATION-FRAGMENTATION EQUATIONS
PHILIPPE LAURENÇOT
Abstract. Existence of mass-conserving self-similar solutions with a sufficiently small total mass
is proved for a specific class of homogeneous coagulation and fragmentation coefficients. The proof
combines a dynamical approach to construct such solutions for a regularised coagulation-fragmentation
equation in scaling variables and a compactness method.

1. Introduction
Coagulation-fragmentation equations are mean-field models describing the time evolution of the
size distribution function f of a system of particles varying their sizes due to the combined effect of
binary coalescence and multiple breakage. The dynamics of the size distribution function f (t, x) of
particles of size x ∈ (0, ∞) at time t > 0 is governed by the nonlinear integral equation
∂t f (t, x) = Cf (t, x) + F f (t, x) ,
in

f (0, x) = f (x) ,

x ∈ (0, ∞) ,

account for the coagulation and fragmentation processes, respectively. In (1.1c), the coagulation
kernel K is a non-negative and symmetric function defined on (0, ∞)2 and K(x, y) = K(y, x) is the
rate at which two particles of respective sizes x and y collide and merge. In (1.1d), a(x) is the overall
fragmentation rate of particles of size x and the distribution of the sizes of fragments resulting from
the splitting of a particle of size y is the daughter distribution function x 7→ b(x, y). Since we discard
the possibility of loss of matter during breakup, b is assumed to satisfy

that is, the fragmentation of a particle of size y only produces particles of smaller sizes and no
matter is lost. Coagulation being also a mass-conserving process, we expect that matter is conserved
throughout time evolution; that is,

Breakdown in finite time of the identity (1.3) may actually occur; that is, there is Tl ∈ [0, ∞) such
that
M1 (f (t)) < M1 (f in ) ,
t > Tl .
This feature is due, either to a runaway growth generated by a coagulation kernel increasing rapidly
for large sizes, a phenomenon known as gelation [25–27], or to the appearance of dust resulting
from an overall fragmentation rate a which is unbounded as x → 0, a phenomenon referred to as
shattering [13, 28]. Loosely speaking, for the coagulation and fragmentation coefficients given by

K(x, y) = K0 xα y λ−α + xλ−α y α ,
(x, y) ∈ (0, ∞)2 ,
(1.4a)

with α ∈ [0, 1], λ ∈ [2α, 1 + α], and K0 > 0, and
a(x) = a0 xγ ,

b(x, y) = bν (x, y) := (ν + 2)xν y −ν−1 ,

0<x<y ,

(1.4b)

with γ ∈ R, ν ∈ (−2, ∞), and a0 > 0, gelation after a finite time occurs when α > 1/2 in (1.4a)
and γ ∈ (0, λ − 1) in (1.4b) [10, 11, 18, 20, 25, 27], while shattering is observed when γ < 0 in
(1.4b) and there is no coagulation (K0 = 0) [3, 13, 28]. In contrast, mass-conserving solutions to
(1.1) satisfying (1.3) for all t ≥ 0 exist when, either λ ∈ [0, 1] and γ ≥ 0, or λ ∈ (1, 2] and
γ > λ−1 [2,4–7,9,10,12,21,23,34,35,38]. The previous discussion reveals that the value γ = λ−1 > 0
is a borderline case with respect to the occurrence of the gelation phenomenon. Indeed, on the one
hand, when λ ∈ (1, 2], γ = λ − 1, and α > −ν − 1 in (1.4), mass-conserving solutions to (1.1) on
[0, ∞) exist when M1 (f in ) is sufficiently small [19], which is in accordance with numerical simulations
performed in [33] for the particular choice
α=1,

λ=2,

γ=1,

ν=0.

(1.5)

On the other hand, gelation (in finite time) takes place when α = 1, λ = 2, γ = 1, ν > −1, and
M1 (f in ) is large enough [7, 33, 37].
Besides, the choice γ = λ − 1 > 0 in (1.4) has another interesting feature. Indeed, in this case,
equation (1.1a) satisfies a scale invariance which complies with the conservation of matter (1.3).
More precisely, if f is a solution to (1.1a) and r > 0, then the function fr defined by
fr (t, x) := r 2 f (r 1−λ t, rx) ,

(t, x) ∈ [0, ∞) × (0, ∞) ,

(1.6)

is also a solution to (1.1a) and M1 (fr (t)) = M1 (f (r 1−λ t)) for t ≥ 0. We then look for particular
solutions to (1.1a) which are left invariant by the transformation (1.6), that is, fr = f for all r > 0;
that is, according to (1.6), r 2 f (r 1−λ t, rx) = f (t, x) for all (r, t, x) ∈ (0, ∞)3 . The choice r = t1/(λ−1)
in the previous identity gives

f (t, x) = t2/(λ−1) f 1, xt1/(λ−1) ,
(t, x) ∈ (0, ∞)2 ,

and raises the question of the existence of mass-conserving self-similar solutions of the form

(t, x) 7−→ t2/(λ−1) ψ xt1/(λ−1) ,
(t, x) ∈ (0, ∞)2 .

(1.7)

In (1.7), the profile ψ is yet to be determined and is requested to have a finite total mass M1 (ψ) = ̺ ∈
(0, ∞). According to the numerical simulations performed in [33], such solutions exist for sufficiently
small values of ̺ and are expected to describe the long term dynamics of mass-conserving solutions to
(1.1) with the same total mass ̺. Thus, the existence, uniqueness, and properties of mass-conserving
self-similar solutions to (1.1a) of the form (1.7) are of high interest.
The purpose of this paper is to provide one step in that direction and figure out whether selfsimilar solutions to (1.1a) of the form (1.6) do exist when γ = λ − 1 > 0 in (1.4). Such a quest
is not hopeless. Indeed, on the one hand, when the parameters in (1.4) are given by (1.5), their
existence is supported by numerical simulations performed in [33], which indicate that there exist
mass-conserving self-similar solutions to (1.1a) of the form (1.7) with M1 (ψ) = ̺, provided the ratio
a0 /(̺K0 ) is large enough. On the other hand, if
α=1,

λ=2,

γ=1,

ν = −1 ,

(1.8)

then, for any ̺ > 0, the existence of a unique mass-conserving self-similar solution to (1.1a) of the
form (1.7) with M1 (ψ) = ̺ is shown in [24] and this particular solution is a global attractor for
the dynamics of (1.1) when the initial condition f in satisfies M1 (f in ) = ̺. The approach developed
in [24] heavily relies on the specific structure of (1.1a) for the choice of parameters (1.8), which allows
us to use the Laplace transform, and is thus not likely to be adapted to the more general setting
considered herein. Instead, we first construct mass-conserving self-similar solution to (1.1a) of the
form (1.7) for a restricted class of daughter distribution functions b by a dynamical approach and
carefully keep track of the dependence of the estimates on the various parameters involved in K, a,
and b. We next use a compactness method to extend the existence result to a broader class of b.
Specifically, we consider

For the above described class of coagulation and fragmentation coefficients, the main result of this
paper guarantees the existence of at least one mass-conserving self-similar solution to (1.1a) of the

m ∈ (0, 1) .

Remark 1.2. The self-similar ansatz (1.7) differs slightly from that of FS in Theorem 1.1, see (1.20).
However, they can both be mapped to each other, up to an X1 -invariant dilation of the profile. Indeed,
if FS (t, x) = sλ (t)2 ϕ (xsλ (t)), (t, x) ∈ (0, ∞)2, is a mass-conserving self-similar solution to (1.1a) of
the form (1.20), then it is actually well-defined for (t, x) ∈ (−1/(λ − 1), ∞) × (0, ∞). Combining
this property with the autonomous character of the coagulation-fragmentation equation (1.1a) implies
that F̃S (t, x) := FS (t − (λ − 1)−1 , x), (t, x) ∈ (0, ∞)2, is also a solution to (1.1a) and satisfies


with ψ(y) = (λ − 1)−2/(λ−1) ϕ y(λ − 1)−1/(λ−1) , y > 0. In other words, F̃S is a mass-conserving
self-similar solution to (1.1a) of the form (1.7) and it has total mass ̺, since M1 (ϕ) = M1 (ψ) = ̺
by (1.15).
On the one hand, Theorem 1.1 and Remark 1.2 provide the existence of mass-conserving self-similar
solutions to (1.1) of the form (1.7) with a sufficiently small total mass for the parameters given by
(1.5), which is in perfect agreement with the numerical simulations performed in [33]. It is yet unclear
whether ̺⋆ is the largest value of ̺ for which a mass-conserving self-similar solution to (1.1) of the
form (1.7) with total mass ̺ exists. However, Theorem 1.1 cannot be valid for any ̺ > 0 in general.
Indeed, when the parameters in (1.9) are given by (1.5), gelation occurs for sufficiently large mass,
as indicated by explicit computations performed in [33,37] and proved in [7] when a0 /(̺K0 ) < 1. On
the other hand, Theorem 1.1 provides the existence of mass-conserving self-similar solutions to (1.1)
of the form (1.7) with a sufficiently small total mass for the parameters given by (1.8), a result which
is far from optimal, since such a solution exists for any value of the total mass, according to [24].
A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the absence of a threshold mass is due to the
non-integrability as x → 0 of the daughter distribution function b−1 , which is not really exploited in
the proof of Theorem 1.1 below.
Let us now describe the approach we use in this paper to prove Theorem 1.1. Owing to the
homogeneity of K, a, and B, inserting the ansatz (1.20) in (1.1a) implies that ϕ solves the integrodifferential equation
y

dϕ
(y) + 2ϕ(y) = Cϕ(y) + F ϕ(y) ,

y ∈ (0, ∞) .

(1.22)

Unfortunately, the equation (1.22) seems hardly tractable as an initial value problem with initial
condition at y = 0. Indeed, on the one hand, the right hand side of (1.22) depends not only on the
past (0, y) of y but also on its future (y, ∞). On the other hand, the left hand side is degenerate, as
the factor y in front of dϕ/dy vanishes at y = 0. Assuming further that y 2 ϕ(y) → 0 as y → 0, one
can get rid of the derivative in (1.22) and show that ϕ also satisfies the nonlinear integral equation

for y ∈ (0, ∞), see [13, 36]. It is however unclear whether this alternative formulation is more helpful
than (1.22) to investigate the existence issue, though it has been extensively used to determine the
behaviour for small and large sizes of the profile of mass-conserving self-similar solutions to the
coagulation equation [16, 26, 31, 32, 36]. We thus employ a different approach here, which has already
proved successful for the coagulation equation [12, 15, 32] and the fragmentation equation [12, 29]. It
relies on the construction of a convex and compact subset of X1 which is left invariant by the evolution
equation associated to (1.22). This evolution equation is actually obtained from (1.1) by using the
so-called scaling or self-similar variables. More precisely, recalling that sλ (t) = (1 + (λ − 1)t)1/(λ−1) ,
t ≥ 0, we introduce the scaling variables
s := ln sλ (t) ,

y := xsλ (t) ,

(1.26a)
(1.26b)

Comparing (1.22) and (1.26a), we readily see that ϕ is a stationary solution to (1.26a), so that
proving Theorem 1.1 amounts to find a steady-state solution to (1.26a). To this end, we shall use
a consequence of Schauder’s fixed point theorem which guarantees the existence of a steady state
for a dynamical system defined in a closed subset Y of a Banach space X which leaves invariant
a convex and compact subset of Y , see [1, Proposition 22.13] and [17, Proof of Theorem 5.2] (see
also [12, Theorem 1.2] for the extension of this result to a Banach space endowed with its weak
topology). Applying the just mentioned result requires identifying a suitable functional framework
in which, not only (1.26) is well-posed, but also leaves invariant a convex and compact subset of the
chosen function space. To achieve this goal, the assumption (1.9f) for any (m, p) ∈ Aν does not seem
to be sufficient and we first construct a family (bε , Bε )ε∈(0,1) of approximations of (b, B), which satisfy
not only (1.9d) and (1.9e), but also (1.9f) for any (m, p) ∈ A0 and Bε ∈ W 1,1 (0, 1). We then prove
that the corresponding rescaled coagulation-fragmentation equation (1.26) is well-posed in X1 for
+
initial conditions f in ∈ Xm
∩ X1+λ satisfying M1 (f in ) = ̺ ∈ (0, ̺⋆ ). We also show the existence of
0
an invariant convex and compact subset Zε of X1 for the associated dynamical system. According to
the above mentioned result, this analysis guarantees the existence of a stationary solution ϕε ∈ X1+ to
(1.26a) satisfying M1 (ϕε ) = ̺. Moreover, it turns out that there is a convex and sequentially weakly
compact subset Z of X1 such that Zε ⊂ Z for all ε ∈ (0, 1). Consequently, (ϕε )ε∈(0,1) is relatively
sequentially weakly compact in X1 and the information derived from Z allows us to prove that cluster
points in X1,w of (ϕε )ε∈(0,1) as ε → 0 solve (1.22), thereby completing the proof of Theorem 1.1.

+
Remark 1.3. In the companion paper [19], we prove that, given an initial condition f in ∈ Xm
∩
0
X2λ−α satisfying M1 (f in ) = ̺ ∈ (0, ̺⋆ ), the coagulation-fragmentation equation (1.1) has a unique
mass-conserving weak solution on [0, ∞) under the same assumptions (1.9) on the coagulation and
fragmentation coefficients. This result is perfectly consistent with the numerical simulations performed in [33], as is Theorem 1.1.

2. Self-similar solutions: a regularised problem
In this section, we assume that K, a, and b are coagulation and fragmentation coefficients satisfying
(1.9) and we fix ̺ ∈ (0, ̺⋆ ).
As already mentioned, two steps are needed to prove Theorem 1.1 and this section is devoted
to the first step; that is, the proof of Theorem 1.1 for a family (bε )ε>0 of approximations of the

Remark 2.1. In fact, if the function B in (1.9e) satisfies (1.9f) for any (m, p) ∈ A0 , as well as
B(0) = 0 and B ∈ W 1,1 (0, 1), then we may take Bε = B. This is true in particular for the parabolic
daughter distribution function corresponding to B(z) = 12z(1 − z), z ∈ (0, 1).
Next, since ̺ ∈ (0, ̺⋆ ), we infer from (2.3) that there is ε̺ ∈ (0, ε0 ) such that

Finally, since m1 + λ − 1 ∈ (m0 , λ) by (1.9a) and (m1 , 1) ∈ Aν by (1.10a), we may fix
m1 + 1 + q1 (λ − 2)
∈ (m0 , λ) .
q1 ∈ (1, 2) such that (m1 , q1 ) ∈ Aν and

The main steps in the proof of Proposition 2.2 are the derivation of (2.11a) and (2.11c). The former
is inspired from [12, Lemma 4.2] and combines a differential inequality for a superlinear moment,
involving here the weight x 7→ x ln x, and a differential inequality for a sublinear moment. The
validity of (2.11a) requires the smallness condition ̺ ∈ (0, ̺⋆ ), the value of ̺⋆ being prescribed by
an algebraic inequality established in [19, Lemma 2.3], see (2.20) below. As for (2.11c), it relies
on the monotonicity of x 7→ xm1 K(x, y) to handle the contribution of the coagulation term, similar
arguments being used in [7,8,22,30] to derive Lp -estimates for solutions to coagulation-fragmentation
equations.
2.1. Scaling variables and well-posedness. Let ε ∈ (0, ε̺). We begin with the existence and
uniqueness of a mass-conserving weak solution to
∂s gε (s, x) = −x∂x gε (s, x) − 2gε (s, x) + Cgε (s, x) + Fε gε (s, x) ,

x ∈ (0, ∞) ,

(s, x) ∈ (0, ∞)2 ,

where Fε denotes the fragmentation operator with b replaced with bε .

Proposition 2.3. Consider an initial condition f in ∈ X1+ ∩ Xm0 ∩ X2λ−α such that
M1 (f in ) = ̺ .

(2.13)

There is a unique mass-conserving weak solution gε to (1.1) on [0, ∞) satisfying

gε ∈ C([0, T ), Xm1 ,w ) ∩ L∞ ((0, T ), Xm0 ) ∩ L∞ ((0, T ), X2λ−α ) for any T > 0 ,

We recall that Nϑ,ε in (2.15) is defined in Proposition 2.2,

Proof. Owing to (1.9a), (1.9b), (1.9c), (2.1c), (2.2a), and the integrability properties of Bε , we are
in a position to apply [19, Theorem 1.2], which guarantees the existence and uniqueness of a massconserving weak solution fε to the coagulation-fragmentation equation
∂t fε (t, x) = Cfε (t, x) + Fε fε (t, x) ,

The next results are devoted to the derivation of a series of estimates satisfied by the weak solutions
to (2.12) provided by Proposition 2.3, except for Lemma 2.12 where the continuous dependence of
Ψε (·; f in ) in X1 with respect to the initial condition is established.
Throughout the remainder of this section, κ and (κi )i≥1 are positive constants depending only on
λ, α, K0 , a0 , B, ν, m0 , m1 , q1 , and ̺. Dependence upon additional parameters is indicated explicitly.
2.2. Moment Estimates. We begin with the derivation of estimates for moments of order m ∈
[m1 , 1], the parameter m1 being defined in (1.14).
Lemma 2.4. Consider ε ∈ (0, ε̺) and f in ∈ X0+ ∩X1+λ such that M1 (f in ) = ̺ and let gε = Ψε (·; f in )
be given by (2.17). For m ∈ [m1 , 1), there is κ1 (m) > 0 depending on m such that, for t ≥ 0,

Consequently, we infer from (1.9b), (2.5), (2.15) (with ϑ(x) = xm , x > 0), and the non-negativity of
gε and K that
d
Mm (gε (s)) ≤ −(1 − m)Mm (gε (s)) + a0 bm,1,ε Mm+λ−1 (gε (s))
ds
≤ −(1 − m)Mm (gε (s)) + a0 (1 + bm0 ,1 )Mm+λ−1 (gε (s)) .
Observing that m + λ − 1 ∈ [1, λ), it follows from (2.14) and Hölder’s inequality that
Mm+λ−1 (gε (s)) ≤ Mλ (gε (s))(m+λ−2)/(λ−1) M1 (gε (s))(1−m)/(λ−1)

Lemma 2.6. Consider ε ∈ (0, ε̺ ) and f in ∈ X0+ ∩ X1+λ satisfying (2.22) and let gε = Ψε (·; f in ) be
given by (2.17). Assume also that f in ∈ Xm for some m > 1 + λ − α. Then there is κ6 (m) > 0
depending on m such that

Mm (gε (s)) ≤ max Mm (f in ), κ6 (m) ,

Proof. Let s ≥ 0. We infer from (2.2) and (2.15) that

On the one hand, since λ > 1, it follows from (2.14), (2.22), and Hölder’s inequality that

Equivalently,
In addition, by (2.5),

̺(1−λ)/(m−1) Mm (gε (s))(m+λ−2)/(m−1) ≤ Mm+λ−1 (gε (s)) .

On the other hand, to estimate the contribution of the coagulation term, we argue as in [19,
Lemma 2.6]. Since m > 1, there is cm > 0 depending only on m such that

we deduce from (2.14), (2.22), and Hölder’s inequality that
Mm+λ−α−1 (gε (s)) ≤ ̺(1+α−λ)/(m−1) Mm (gε (s))(m+λ−α−2)/(m−1) ,

with κ6 (m) := (κ8 (m)/δ̺,m )(m−1)/(m+λ−2) . Lemma 2.6 is then a consequence of the comparison
principle.

We finally return to the behaviour for small sizes.

Lemma 2.7. Consider ε ∈ (0, ε̺ ) and f in ∈ X0+ ∩ X1+λ satisfying (2.22) and let gε = Ψε (·; f in ) be
given by (2.17). For m ∈ [m0 , m1 ), there is κ9 (m) > 0 depending on m such that, if f in ∈ Xm , then

Mm (gε (s)) ≤ max Mm (f in ), κ9 (m)M1+λ,ε ,
s≥0,
where

M1+λ,ε := sup{M1+λ (gε (s))} < ∞ .
s≥0

Proof. We first note that M1+λ,ε is indeed finite according to Lemma 2.6. Next, let s ≥ 0. As at the
beginning of the proof of Lemma 2.4, we infer from (2.2), (2.5), and (2.12) that
d
Mm (gε (s)) ≤ −(1 − m)Mm (gε (s)) + a0 bm,1,ε Mm+λ−1 (gε (s))
ds
≤ −(1 − m)Mm (gε (s)) + a0 (1 + bm0 ,1 )Mm+λ−1 (gε (s)) .

Since m + λ − 1 ∈ (m, 1 + λ), we deduce from Hölder’s inequality that

Mm+λ−1 (gε (s)) ≤ M1+λ (gε (s))(λ−1)/(1+λ−m) Mm (gε (s))(2−m)/(1+λ−m) .

Consequently,
d
(λ−1)/(1+λ−m)

Mm (gε (s))(2−m)/(1+λ−m)

,

with κ9 (m) := (a0 (1 + bm0 ,1 )/(1 − m))(1+λ−m)/(λ−1) . Lemma 2.7 follows from the above differential
inequality and the comparison principle.

Up to now, we have derived estimates which do not depend on ε ∈ (0, ε̺ ) and which will thus be
of utmost importance in the next section to take the limit ε → 0. However, these estimates do not
provide enough control on the behaviour for small sizes for the proof of Proposition 2.2, for which
the next result is required.

Lemma 2.8. Consider ε ∈ (0, ε̺ ) and f in ∈ X0+ ∩ X1+λ satisfying (2.22) and let gε = Ψε (·; f in ) be
given by (2.17). For m ∈ (−1, 0], there is κ10 (m, ε) > 0 depending on m and ε such that

Mm (gε (s)) ≤ max Mm (f in ), κ10 (m, ε)M1+λ,ε

.

s≥0 .

Proof. The proof is exactly the same as that of Lemma 2.7 with the only difference that bm,1,ε cannot
be bounded from above by a constant which does not depend on ε for all m ∈ (−1, 0], though it is
finite due to (2.6).

2.3. Weighted Lq1 -estimate. The last estimate which does not depend on ε ∈ (0, ε̺ ) is the following weighted Lq1 -estimate, the exponent q1 being defined in (2.9).

2.4. W 1,1 -estimate. It turns out that the weighted Lq1 -estimate derived in Lemma 2.9, though at the
heart of the proof of Theorem 1.1, is not sufficient to prove Proposition 2.2, and the final estimate
needed for the proof of Proposition 2.2 is the following W 1,1 -estimate which depends strongly on
ε ∈ (0, ε̺ ).

Lemma 2.10. Consider ε ∈ (0, ε̺) and f in ∈ X0+ ∩ X1+λ satisfying (2.22) and let gε = Ψε (·; f in ) be
given by (2.17). Assume also that f in ∈ Xλ−2 ∩ W 1,1 (0, ∞). Then there is κ12 (ε) > 0 depending on
ε such that

2.5. Invariant Set. The analysis performed in the previous three sections now allows us to construct

Note that we may assume that E̺ : x 7→ ̺e−x belongs to Zε , after possibly taking larger constants
in (2.32) without changing their dependence with respect to the involved parameters. In particular,
Zε is non-empty.
As we shall see now, the outcome of the analysis performed in the previous sections provides the
invariance of Zε for the dynamics of (2.12) when ε ∈ (0, ε̺ ).
Lemma 2.11. Consider ε ∈ (0, ε̺) and f in ∈ Zε . Then Ψε (s; f in ) ∈ Zε for all s ≥ 0. Furthermore,
Zε is a non-empty, convex, and compact subset of X1 .
Proof. Let f in ∈ Zε . Setting gε = Ψε (·; f in ), see (2.17), it satisfies (2.14) by Lemma 2.4, from which
we readily obtain that gε (s) ∈ X1+ and M1 (gε (s)) = ̺ for all s ≥ 0.
Next, let s ≥ 0. We infer from (2.32b) and Lemma 2.4 (with m = m1 ) that gε (s) satisfies (2.32b).
Also, since f in satisfies (2.22) according to (2.32b), we are in a position to apply Lemma 2.6 for
m ≥ 1 + λ > 1 + λ − α and deduce from (2.32c) for f in that (2.32c) is satisfied by gε (s) for any
m ≥ 1 + λ. This property (with m = 1 + λ) along with Lemma 2.7 (with m = m0 ) guarantees that
gε (s) satisfies (2.32d). We further use (2.32c) (with m = 1 + λ) and (2.32d) that we just established
for gε together with (2.31) and Hölder’s inequality to obtain
Mµ1 (gε (s)) ≤ M1+λ (gε (s))(µ1 −m0 )/(1+λ−m0 ) Mm0 (gε (s))(1+λ−µ1 )/(1+λ−m0 )

≤ κ6 (1 + λ)(µ1 −m0 )/(1+λ−m0 ) [κ6 (1 + λ)κ9 (m0 )](1+λ−µ1 )/(1+λ−m0 )

≤ κ9 (m0 )(1+λ−µ1 )/(1+λ−m0 ) κ6 (1 + λ) .

Hence, gε (s) satisfies (2.32e) for s ≥ 0. We now combine the just established property (2.32e) for gε
with Lemma 2.10 and realize that gε (s) satisfies (2.32f) for s ≥ 0. Finally, since f in satisfies (2.32g)
and (2.32h), it follows at once from the already proved property (2.32c) for gε (for m = 1 + λ),

Mass-conserving self-similar solutions to C-F equations

23

Lemma 2.8, and Lemma 2.10 that gε (s) also satisfies (2.32g) and (2.32h). Summarizing, we have
shown that gε (s) ∈ Zε for all s ≥ 0.
Next, the set Zε is convex and its compactness in X1 follows from its boundedness in Xλ−2 ∩ X1+λ ,
the compactness of the embedding of W 1,1 (1/R, R) in L1 (1/R, R), which holds true for all R > 1,
and Vitali’s theorem [14, Theorem 2.24].

To complete the proof of Proposition 2.2, the missing tile is the continuity of weak solutions to
(2.12) with respect to the initial condition which we establish now.
Lemma 2.12. Let ε ∈ (0, ε̺ ).

(a) For s ≥ 0, the map f in 7−→ Ψε (s; f in ), defined in (2.17), is continuous from Zε endowed with
the norm topology of X1 to itself.
(b) For f in ∈ Zε , the map s 7−→ Ψε (s; f in ) belongs to C([0, ∞), X1).

In other words, Ψε : [0, ∞) × Zε −→ Zε is a dynamical system for the norm topology of X1 .

Proof of Lemma 2.12 (a). Consider (f1in , f2in ) ∈ Zε2 and put gi,ε := Ψε (·; fiin ), i = 1, 2. Arguing as in
the proof of [19, Theorem 1.2 (c)], it follows from (2.12) that, for s ≥ 0,

vε (s) := Mα (g1,ε (s)) + Mα (g2,ε (s)) + M2λ−α (g1,ε (s)) + M2λ−α (g2,ε (s)) .
Since both f1in and f2in belong to Zε , so do g1,ε (s) and g2,ε (s) for all s ≥ 0 by Lemma 2.11. Consequently, as m0 < α < 2λ − α ≤ 1 + λ by (1.9a) and (1.14),

We have now established all the properties required to prove Proposition 2.2.
Proof of Proposition 2.2. Let ε ∈ (0, ε̺). Owing to Lemma 2.11 and Lemma 2.12, Ψε is a dynamical
system on Zε endowed with the norm topology of X1 and Zε is a non-empty, convex, and compact
subset of X1 , which is additionally left positively invariant by Ψε . A consequence of Schauder’s fixed
point theorem, see [1, Proposition 22.13] or [17, Proof of Theorem 5.2], implies that there is ϕε ∈ Zε
such that Ψε (s; ϕε ) = ϕε for all s ≥ 0. In other words, ϕε is a stationary solution to (2.12a), from
which we deduce that it satisfies (2.10). Also, since ϕε lies in Zε , it has the properties (2.11) due to
(2.32b), (2.32c), (2.32d), and (2.32f).

3. Self-similar solutions

for all m ≥ 1 + λ. Since q1 > 1 and m1 < 1, we infer from (3.1), (3.2), the reflexivity of
Lq1 ((0, ∞), xm1 dx), and Dunford-Pettis’ theorem that there are ϕ ∈ Xm1 ∩ Lq1 ((0, ∞), xm1 dx) and a
subsequence (ϕεn )n≥1 of (ϕε )ε∈(0,ε̺ ) such that
ϕεn ⇀ ϕ in Xm1 and in Lq1 ((0, ∞), xm1 dx) .

(3.4)

ϕ ∈ Xm and ϕεn ⇀ ϕ in Xm ,

(3.5)

Combining (3.2), (3.3), and (3.4), we further obtain that ϕ ∈ Xm0 and

m > m0 .

that
ϕ ∈ X1+ and M1 (ϕ) = ̺ .
(3.6)
We are left with taking the limit ε → 0 in (2.10). To this end, consider ϑ ∈ Θ1 , the space Θ1 being
defined in (1.17), and note that
|ϑ(x)| ≤ k∂x ϑk∞ x ,

x ∈ [0, ∞) .

Then x 7→ ϑ(x)/x belongs to L∞ (0, ∞) and it readily follows from (3.5) (with m = 1) that

Similarly, χϑ ∈ L∞ ((0, ∞)2) and we argue as in [34], see also [7], to deduce from (1.9a), (1.9c), (1.14),
and (3.5) (with m = α and m = λ − α) that

Finally, by (1.9a), (1.9b), and (3.5) (with m = λ),

y 7→ ya(y)ϕεn (y) ⇀ y 7→ ya(y)ϕ(y) in L1 (0, ∞) ,

Due to (3.10), (3.11), and (3.12), we are in a position to apply [14, Proposition 2.61] (which is a
consequence of Dunford-Pettis’ and Egorov’s theorems) and conclude that

Having established (3.8), (3.9), and (3.13), we may take the limit ε → 0 in (2.10) and deduce that ϕ
satisfies (1.16), thereby completing the proof of Theorem 1.1.
