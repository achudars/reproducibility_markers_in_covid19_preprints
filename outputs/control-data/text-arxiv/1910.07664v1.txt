ABSTRACT

Weak-lensing measurements of the masses of galaxy clusters are commonly based on
the assumption of spherically symmetric density profiles. Yet, the cold dark matter
model predicts the shapes of dark matter halos to be triaxial. Halo triaxiality, and
the orientation of the major axis with respect to the line of sight, are expected to be
the leading cause of intrinsic scatter in weak-lensing mass measurements. The shape
of central cluster galaxies (Brightest Cluster Galaxies; BCGs) is expected to follow
the shape of the dark matter halo. Here we investigate the use of BCG ellipticity
as predictor of the weak-lensing mass bias in individual clusters compared to the
WL
mean. Using weak lensing masses M500
from the Weighing the Giants project, and
M500 derived from gas masses as low-scatter mass proxy, we find that, on average,
the lensing masses of clusters with the roundest / most elliptical 25% of BCGs are
biased ∼ 20% high / low compared to the average, as qualitatively predicted by the
cold dark matter model. For cluster cosmology projects utilizing weak-lensing mass
estimates, the shape of the BCG can thus contribute useful information on the effect
of orientation bias in weak lensing mass estimates as well as on cluster selection bias.

INTRODUCTION

Weak gravitational lensing has established itself as the
method of choice to calibrate the relation between cluster masses and cluster survey observables (von der Linden
et al. 2014; Applegate et al. 2014; Hoekstra et al. 2015; McClintock et al. 2019; Murata et al. 2019). An accurate description of the mass-observable relation is prerequisite for
relating measured cluster number counts to predictions of
the halo mass function, a very powerful probe of cosmology (Allen et al. 2011; Dodelson et al. 2016). Weak-lensing
mass estimates are utilized both as individual cluster mass
estimates in hierarchical cluster cosmology analyses (Mantz
et al. 2010, 2015a; Bocquet et al. 2018), as well as in methods utilizing summary statistics for cluster number counts
and stacked lensing profiles (Rozo et al. 2010; Costanzi et al.

2018). Cluster number counts have placed tight constraints
on a number of cosmological parameters, including dark energy (Vikhlinin et al. 2009; Mantz et al. 2010, 2015a), the
species-summed neutrino mass (Mantz et al. 2015a; Bocquet
et al. 2018) and modified gravity (Schmidt et al. 2009; Mantz
et al. 2015a; Cataneo et al. 2015).
Cluster weak lensing inherently measures projected
masses; to relate these to the spherical overdensity masses
which are used in predictions of the halo mass function,
spherical symmetry is usually assumed. Simulations show
that dark matter haloes have triaxial matter distributions
and that weak-lensing measurements will overestimate the
(spherical overdensity) mass of haloes aligned along the
line of sight and underestimate the mass of haloes oriented
within the plane of the sky. Simulations predict that, although weak lensing is on average an unbiased tracer of
mass, the assumption of sphericity introduces a scatter of
∼20% in weak lensing mass estimates of individual galaxy

clusters in simulations (Meneghetti et al. 2010; Becker
& Kravtsov 2011). Indeed, observationally, Mantz et al.
(2016b) measure an intrinsic scatter of σint = 0.17 ± 0.06
between weak-lensing masses and total cluster masses.
Weak-lensing surveys generally target large samples of
clusters to reduce the impact of the scatter due to halo orientation, which also helps to reduce the inherently large
statistical uncertainty in the weak lensing signal of individual clusters due to shape noise. However, for all methods of
identifying clusters on survey data, the selection property
has large scatter with cluster mass: ∼40% for X-ray luminosity, 20-45% for optical richness, and ∼20% for SunyaevZel’dovich [SZ] decrement (Mantz et al. 2016b; Murata et al.
2018; Farahi et al. 2019). For both cluster richness and the
SZ signal, the scatter is expected to be dominated by orientation bias (Dietrich et al. 2014; Buote & Humphrey 2012;
Angulo et al. 2012; Shirasaki et al. 2016). At a given halo
mass, the scatter between observable and weak-lensing mass
thus becomes correlated, which needs to be accounted for
when addressing selection biases, in the reconstruction of
the mass-observable relation, and the inference of cosmological parameters (Mantz et al. 2010; Mantz 2019). Note that
orientation bias is less significant for X-ray selected samples,
for which the emissivity depends on the square of the density
and only virialized matter contributes to the signal; rather
the scatter in X-ray luminosity at fixed mass is dominated
by the presence and properties of cool cores (e.g. Markevitch
1998).
In the hierarchical structure formation scenario cluster dark matter haloes are generally elongated along the
main filament which feeds matter into the cluster. While the
dynamical friction timescale is large for low-mass infalling
galaxies, it is comparatively short for the most massive, central group galaxies, which thus merge with the Brightest
Cluster Galaxy (BCG). These mergers are mostly dissipationless (De Lucia & Blaizot 2007), so that the BCG shape
will retain information of the infall direction. The dark matter halo and the BCG are therefore thought to be aligned,
as is indicated by simulations (e.g. Schneider et al. 2012)
and observations (Donahue et al. 2016; Wittman et al. 2019;
Durret et al. 2019). Even beyond the BCG, the distribution
of the intracluster light has been shown to follow the distribution of dark matter closely (Montes & Trujillo 2019). The
distributions of both dark matter and stars are expected
to be prolate, so in projection we see roughly circular BCGs
when looking along the major axis and more elliptical BCGs
for other viewing angles. This picture has been confirmed by
studies that show that the (stacked) weak-lensing signal is
anisotropic relative the projected major axis of the central
galaxies in galaxy groups, tracing the projected ellipticity
in the plane of the sky (Oguri et al. 2010; van Uitert et al.
2017; Shin et al. 2018).
We here study the ellipticity of the BCG as a tracer
for the elongation of the cluster dark matter halo along the
line-of-sight. Importantly, while the anisotropy of the shear
signal with relative position angle on the sky largely averages
out for inferences of the ensemble mass, the halo orientation
along the line of sight leads to a biased cluster mass estimate.
The great benefit of using the ellipticity of the BCG is that it
can be determined from weak-lensing-quality imaging data,
and that the BCG is often already determined to serve as
the cluster centre (e.g. Rykoff et al. 2014). The correlation

between BCG ellipticity and weak lensing cluster mass was
already investigated by Marrone et al. (2012) with a sample
of 17 clusters and imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST). They found that the three clusters with the roundest BCGs also have the largest ratios of weak-lensing mass
MWL to the mass inferred from a scaling relation between
Ysph (the Compton Y -parameter integrated in a spherical
volume) and MWL . Similarly, Gruen et al. (2014) found a
correlation between BCG ellipticity and the weak lensing
and SZ mass ratio for 12 clusters. Mahdavi et al. (2013)
found some correlation using masses assuming hydrostatic
equilbrium for a subsample of non cool core systems in their
total sample of 39 clusters. However, clusters are generally
not in a state of hydrostatic equilibrium, resulting in mass
estimates that preferentially scatter towards lower masses.
In this work we study a much larger sample of 51 galaxy clusters using data from the Weighing the Giants project (WtG,
von der Linden et al. 2014). We measure BCG ellipticities
on the same Subaru SuprimeCam imaging from which the
WtG team measured weak-lensing masses (von der Linden
et al. 2014; Kelly et al. 2014; Applegate et al. 2014). We compare the weak-lensing masses to total masses derived from
gas masses, which trace total mass with very low scatter for
the massive clusters studied here (Mantz et al. 2016b). This
analysis should provide the cleanest possible signal of the
effect of triaxiality on weak lensing masses.
The structure of this paper is as follows. In Section 2
we summarize the data used. In Section 3 we detail how the
shape of each BCG was determined through model fitting.
In Section 4 we correlate the BCG shapes with weak lensing masses and in Section 5 we discuss the implications for
cluster cosmology.
The fiducial cosmology adopted in this paper is a flat
ΛCDM model with Ωm = 0.3 and H0 = 100 h km s−1 Mpc−1 ,
where h = 0.7.

DATA

The Weighing the Giants (WtG) project measured weaklensing masses for 51 massive galaxy clusters, using deep
multi-band imaging from SuprimeCam on the Subaru telescope. The details of the SuprimeCam data analysis are presented in von der Linden et al. (2014) and Kelly et al. (2014),
and the details of the cluster mass measurements are presented in Applegate et al. (2014). The clusters are a subset of the clusters in the Brightest Cluster Survey (BCS;
Ebeling et al. 1998, 2000), the REFLEX survey (Böhringer
et al. 2004), and the MAssive Cluster Survey (MACS; Ebeling et al. 2001, 2007, 2010). All of them are selected from
the Rosat All Sky Survey (RASS, Truemper 1993); owing to
the all-sky nature and high flux limit of RASS, and a selection by X-ray luminosity LX > 1045 erg s−1 , these clusters
are among the most massive clusters in the Universe. The
weak-lensing mass estimates were used along with gas-mass
estimates from Chandra imaging for 139 clusters, as well
as the original survey data, for a self-consistent analysis of
cluster scaling relations and cosmology based on these three
surveys in Mantz et al. (2015a, 2016b).
For the present study, we work with the hypothesis that
the scatter in weak-lensing masses is predominantly driven
by the triaxiality of the cluster dark matter halos and the
MNRAS 000, 1–7 (2019)

BCG and halo orientation
orientation of the major axis along the line of sight, as suggested by simulations. To measure the scatter, we need a
“true” halo mass and then compute the residual of the weak
lensing mass. We calculate a “true” halo mass from the
gas mass Mgas measurements from Mantz et al. (2016b)
and the cluster baryon fraction.1 Mgas correlates tightly
with spherical-overdensity mass, regardless of cluster dynamical state (e.g. Nagai et al. 2007; Wu et al. 2015; Truong
et al. 2018; Farahi et al. 2018). Observationally, Mantz et al.
(2016a) verified this tight relation by measuring the scaling relation between Mgas and hydrostatic mass estimates
of relaxed clusters, finding the scatter to be ∼8%, much
smaller than the typical scatter of weak-lensing mass estimates. Note that the measured scatter of 8% would include
both the scatter between true mass and gas mass, and any
systematic scatter between true mass and hydrostatic mass
estimates, although the latter should be minimized for relaxed clusters. In addition, the effect of triaxiality on Mgas is
expected to be small, since the gas follows the gravitational
potential (and isopotential surfaces are rounder than the
isodensity surfaces of the dark matter density) and because
X-ray emission scales with the square of density, meaning
that significant projection would be needed to mimic an increase in gas density. This ensures that the effect of halo
orientation on weak lensing masses remains the dominant
source of scatter in our analysis.
The conversion of Mgas to a low scatter total mass estimate is done using the scaling relation derived by Mantz
et al. (2016b), where weak lensing data was used to set
the average translation. Here we investigate the residual
in that relation. Equivalently we could use Mgas instead of
total mass, but the latter more clearly relates to our hypothesis of weak lensing over- or underestimating the true
mass of a cluster. As in Mantz et al. (2016b), we set the
M500 = Mgas (r500 )/0.125, where M500 is the total, sphericaloverdensity mass of a cluster within the radius r500 , defined
3
as M500 = (4π/3) 500 ρcrit (z)r500
with ρcrit (z) being the critical density at the cluster redshift z. r500 and the enclosed
gas mass, Mgas (r500 ), are determined self-consistently from
the joint cosmology and scaling relations analysis in (Mantz
et al. 2015a, 2016b), which also determined the best-fit cluster baryon fraction to be fgas (r500 ) = 0.125.
We here use weak-lensing mass estimates within the
WL
same aperture, M500
= MWL (r500 ). This is different from
how Becker & Kravtsov (2011) measured the weak-lensing
scatter due to triaxiality in simulations: they used the weaklensing data alone to estimate both M500 and r500 . The mass
of a cluster largely scales the amplitude of the measured tangential shear profile. When the mass (i.e. the lensing profile amplitude) is overestimated, the estimated r500 also increases, leading to a further increase in M500 . The scatter
that we measure here is thus expected to be smaller than
Becker & Kravtsov ’s measurement. In Section 4 we also test
the effect of using the weak lensing mass estimates within
WL
the weak lensing derived aperture r500
.

we here measure the projected ellipticities of the BCGs
from the SuprimeCam imaging in the RC band. For cluster Abell 1835 no RC imaging was available and we used
SuprimeCam IC band data instead. The BCGs for all clusters in the WtG sample were identified in von der Linden
et al. (2014), with positions listed in Mantz et al. (2015b).

MODELING OF THE BCG

We use GALFIT (Peng et al. 2002) to model the surface
brightness profile of the BCG as a single Sérsic profile, whose
shape is determined by the ratio of the minor to major axis
ratio b/a and the position angle. Although a single Sérsic
profile is a simplistic model, it should be sufficient to capture the shape of the BCG, which is the main focus of this
work. We expect the outer envelope of the BCG to be most
aligned with the dark matter halo, so we focus on obtaining
a good fit for the outskirts, where a single Sérsic profile is
often a good approximation (Kormendy et al. 2009).
The cores of clusters are the densest environments on
galaxy scales, so there are often other objects close to the
BCG. This is exacerbated by the fact that astronomical images are projections of a 3D distribution of galaxies. We
therefore take special care to account for any contaminating
light from sources other than the BCG to obtain an accurate
ellipticity estimate. We use the same approach as Wittman
et al. (2019) and Durret et al. (2019) to account for contamination by using a bad pixel map in GALFIT, which specifies
which pixels should be taken into account when fitting a
parametric model to the image. Instead of masking nearby
objects, we also tried to fit their light with GALFIT, but this
method did not produce as reliable fits for the BCGs.
We take the following steps in order to create a model
for the surface brightness profile of the BCG, which we describe further below:
(i) Determine the size of the fitting region
(ii) Detect objects other than the BCG in the region
(iii) Create a mask for all objects but the BCG
(iv) Provide initial guesses for GALFIT
(v) Create a PSF image for GALFIT
(vi) First GALFIT run
(vii) Determine all objects in the model subtracted image
(viii) Create a mask for all objects in the model subtracted image
(ix) Second GALFIT run
The region around the BCG to run GALFIT on is determined by identifying all pixels whose light could possibly be
associated with the BCG, or affect the measured shape of the
BCG. For this we ran SExtractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996)
to create a segmentation map, that specifies which pixels
are part of which detected object. The BCG is identified in
the segmentation map as the object containing the coordinate of the BCG defined by von der Linden et al. (2014).
The SExtractor deblending parameters DEBLEND_NTHRESH,
the number of thresholds for the deblending algorithm, and
DEBLEND_MINCONT, the parameter setting the minimum fraction of light contained within a subregion compared to the
whole region (or minimum contrast) for deblending algorithm, determine whether light is from a single source or several and were set such that there is minimal deblending and

ing to the BCG are then flagged in the bad pixel map. When
SExtractor deblends one or more objects, it automatically
assigns which pixels are associated with which object, so
that this approach works even when the light of the BCG is
blended with other objects. For some clusters, nearby bright
objects were not adequately masked by this procedure. In
those cases we enlarged the masks manually to correct for
it. All pixels flagged in the weight map of the observations,
which notes pixels in the image containing artifacts, are also
flagged in the bad pixel map.
The PSF of the observations is approximated by a circular Moffat profile with a full width at half maximum (α)
set equal to the seeing of the image. We set the other Moffat
parameter (β) equal to 3.5 to limit the effect of the PSF at
large radii. The size of the BCG is much larger than the size
of the PSF and we expect a negligible error in the overall
BCG shape due to the difference between the true PSF and
our approximation.
We use the SExtractor measurements with low deblending thresholds (masking column in Table 2) as the initial guesses for GALFIT. The centres of our BCGs are well
defined but to allow GALFIT a little flexibility to fit a single
Sérsic model, the x and y coordinates of the model are both
allowed to vary by 7 pixels maximum (the pixel scale is 0.200 ).
A constraint on the Sérsic index 0.7 6 n 6 6 is set, which
is a range similar to the results of Durret et al. (2019), who
measured GALFIT parameters for BCGs from HST imaging.
Although for some BCGs, GALFIT returns a best-fit value
of n = 6, allowing larger values of n did not improve the
quality of the fits. Weak constraints are set on other morphological parameters. The profile normalization is allowed
to vary to 2 magnitudes fainter than the SExtractor estimate and the half light radius between 20 pixels smaller
than the SExtractor estimate. Unrestrictive upper limits
were placed on the magnitude and size. No axis ratio of minor axis b divided by major axis a lower than 0.1 is allowed,
as this is not physically expected and indeed in the analysis
no BCG model came close to this value.
Upon visual inspection of the GALFIT results, we find
that a second run of SExtractor and GALFIT is often necessary to refine the fit. This allows us to mask objects that
are too close to the BCG to be deblended by the first
SExtractor run but are distinct objects that bias the best
fit parameters. Such objects can be easily identified in the
model-subtracted-image made by GALFIT even if the initial
BCG model was not fully representative of the real BCG
shape. The detection was done with SExtractor with deblending values as shown in the core deblending column of
Table 2.

BCG in the cluster Abell 68 and the high redshift cluster MACSJ1423.8+2404, respectively. To check that the
shape of the BCG model is reasonable we visually inspected
the model-subtracted images (bottom left). A good GALFIT
model produces a model-subtracted image that is as close
as possible to the noise level, as the background sky noise
is subtracted from the image. As mentioned above, we paid
particular attention to whether the model provides a good fit
across the BCG envelope, rather than its core. If the model
was deemed not to be reasonable, the pixel mask (shown in
white in the bottom right panel) was edited to further mask
the light from nearby objects. In some cases we found that
masking the core of the BCG is necessary to get a better
model for the outskirts, as BCG cores tend to be rounder
than the outer envelope, as can be seen in the residual image
of Figure A2. Out of the total of 51 clusters in our sample
we conservatively judged the GALFIT models to be reliable
for 39 of them, whereas 12 were deemed too uncertain for
the analysis.
The uncertainty on the BCG axis ratio is hard to quantify. GALFIT gives an estimate of the 1σ uncertainty based on
the χ2 distribution, but the manual2 warns that this value
is probably an underestimate. In addition, there is no clear
way to incorporate the change in axis ratio due to blending
with nearby objects. As an estimate of the uncertainty we
compare our measurements to the axis ratios estimated by
Durret et al. (2019, priv. comm). Their very similar analysis fits BCG surface brightness profiles with GALFIT to high
resolution images made with the Hubble Space Telescope.
We compare 15 clusters in common between our sample and
find that the BCGs are consistent with a difference in axis
ratio below 0.12. The standard deviation of the difference
is ∼0.05 and this is the estimate for the uncertainty in our
BCG axis ratio values.

CORRELATION BETWEEN BCG SHAPE
AND WEAK LENSING MASS

In Figure 1 we show the correlation between BCG axis ratio
WL
estimates and the mass ratio M500
/M500 for our sample of
39 clusters with reliable BCG models. The uncertainty on
the mass ratio was computed by combining the statistical
uncertainties of the total mass and weak lensing mass. Although the uncertainties on the measurements for individual
clusters are large, there is a visible trend. Most notably, the
clusters with the roundest BCGs (highest axis ratios) tend
to have high mass ratios, whereas those with the most elliptical BCGs (the lowest axis ratios) tend to have low mass
ratios.
We quantify these trends by measuring the average
WL
mass ratio M500
/M500 for clusters in the top and bottom 25th percentiles in terms of BCG axis ratio, as well
as the range in-between. The results are shown in Table 3.
It is striking that for the clusters with the most elongated
(the roundest) BCGs, the mean mass ratio is ∼ 20% lower
(higher) compared to the expectation value of 1. The significance of the difference is ∼4.3σ between the low-b/a and
the high-b/a samples.

Figure 1. Weak lensing and gas mass ratio as a function of the
axis ratio of the best fit GALFIT Sérsic model for the BCGs. To
improve the readability of the plot we show the size of the uncertainty on b/a 0.05 as the black horizontal line and to better
differentiate data points we slightly offset the axis ratio of each
BCG from its actual value. Colored bands show the average mass
ratio in bins of b/a and indicate that on average BCG axis ratio
correlates with weak lensing scatter. Vertical lines show the b/a
values of the bin edges.

Qualitatively, our result is similar to that of Marrone
et al. (2012). Marrone et al. found that the 3 clusters with
the roundest BCGs (b/a & 0.85), have a mean ratio of
WL
M500
/M500 = 1.76 ± 0.17. Of note here is that Marrone
et al. used the overdensity radius r500 as determined by the
weak-lensing mass estimates by Okabe et al. (2010). Due to
the large scatter in weak-lensing masses, this may boost the
mass ratio measured relative to Ysph integrated to the lensing r500 . Marrone et al. do not find a significant trend for
the most elongated clusters, which may simply reflect their
smaller sample size. If we repeat our analysis using instead
WL
the weak lensing masses inside the radius r500
derived from
weak lensing we find a larger difference between the three
selections. The 10 clusters with the roundest BCGs have
an average mass ratio of 1.33 ± 0.15, more consistent with
the findings of Marrone et al. (2012). The significance of a
non-zero difference between clusters with the most elongated
(roundest) BCGs remains similar at ∼ 4.5σ.
A possible alternative baryonic probe for the orientation
of the dark matter halo is the shape of the X-ray emitting
gas (e.g. Umetsu et al. 2018). Substituting the ellipticity of
the X-ray gas of our clusters (taken from Mantz et al. 2015b)
for the BCG shape we find no trend with the weak-lensing
mass residual. Unlike stars, the intracluster gas is collisional,
so the gas will relax more quickly than stars in the cluster.
We therefore expect the stars to more clearly trace of the
orientation of the halo.

CONCLUSIONS

We have shown that the projected ellipticity of the BCG
is a good predictor of the ratio between weak-lensing mass

estimates and low-scatter mass proxies for a sample of 39
galaxy clusters from the WtG survey. This result supports
our hypothesis, namely that the triaxial nature of dark matter halos, and orientation of the halo major axis with respect
to the line of sight, are dominant drivers of the scatter of
weak-lensing estimates of spherical-overdensity masses. We
find that, on average, the lensing masses of clusters with the
roundest / most elliptical 25% of BCGs are biased ∼ 20%
high / low compared to the average. These bias values are
very similar to those found for the roundest / most elliptical haloes in simulations (Henson et al. 2017). Our analysis
provides the clearest result so far that the large scatter in
weak lensing mass is correlated with BCG ellipticity.
Our result has important implications for cluster cosmology. The assumption for cluster cosmological studies is
generally that for an ensemble of clusters, the halo orientation averages out and that the weak lensing masses are
unbiased. This is fair for clusters selected based on X-ray
luminosity, where the scatter in survey observable is driven
by the presence / absence of cool cores, as long as follow-up
weak-lensing studies target random subsamples. However,
for samples selected in optical richness or SZ, orientation
bias is expected to be a leading source of intrinsic scatter in
the mass-observable relation. Hence, at a given threshold in
survey observable, clusters elongated along the line of sight
are more likely to scatter above the threshold. In addition,
orientation bias leads to correlated scatter between survey
observable and weak-lensing mass; the assumption that the
average mass for samples selected by survey observable can
be modeled with random scatter in the mass-observable thus
no longer holds.
For unbiased estimates of cosmological parameters the
ellipticity distribution of cluster dark matter halos, and its
effect on survey observables and weak-lensing mass estimates, needs to be factored into cluster cosmology analyses.
Large cosmological simulations are not yet able to recreate distributions of cluster galaxies with realistic colours
(DeRose et al. 2019), making any calibration of the effect
of halo orientation unreliable, especially for optical surveys
using red sequence galaxies to detect galaxy clusters. Fortunately, our results shows that BCG ellipticity is a good
proxy for the orientation of dark matter halos along the
line of sight, at least if the optical imaging is deep enough
to securely trace the shape of the BCG envelope. Current
projects such as the Dark Energy Survey (DES), or the HyperSuprimeCam survey (HSC) have already measured BCG

ellipticies and could use them in their analyses to mitigate selection biases. The LSST survey will reach similar
depths as the Subaru imaging used here over much of the
extragalactic sky, providing both statistical and systematic
constraining power. Alternative proxies for halo orientation
could be the distribution of (red sequence) cluster galaxies,
and/or the ellipticity of the hot intracluster gas as measured by X-rays or SZ. With additional mass proxies from
other multi-wavelength projects (eROSITA, SO, CMB-S4),
it should become possible to constrain the ellipticity distribution of cluster dark matter halos from the data themselves.

Figure A2. Top left: Image of the BCG of MACSJ1423.8+2404 at z = 0.539; top right: GALFIT model for the BCG; bottom left: Residual
image, the difference between the image and the model; bottom right: Mask image, white pixels were ignored during the fitting of the
model. The romanized axis labels show the distance to the BCG centre in pixels, whereas the italic labels show that distance in kpc. The
fitting produces a good model for this BCG and this cluster is used in the rest of the analysis. Note that part of the core is excluded as
it is rounder than the outskirts of the BCG.
