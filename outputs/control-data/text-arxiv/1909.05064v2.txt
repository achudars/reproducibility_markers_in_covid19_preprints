Introduction

Quillen has shown that the cohomology of the finite general linear groups with
trivial coefficients in their defining characteristic vanishes in the stable range:
when the cohomological degree is small with respect to the rank of the matrices [10]. Specifically, it is known from Maazen’s thesis [8] that Hd (GLr (F2 ); F2 )
is trivial in the range 0 < d < r/2. Quillen’s (unpublished) stability arguments
had to exclude the field F2 , as does the recent extension of his work by Sprehn
and Wahl [11]. Milgram–Priddy [9] and Lahtinen–Sprehn [7] described nonzero classes far away from this bound. The question remained for a while: what
happens at the ‘edge’ [5] of this region, for Hn (GL2n (F2 ); F2 )? This has now
been answered almost completely by Galatius, Kupers, and Randal-Williams [2,
Thm. B], who extended the stable range substantially, showing the vanishing of
the relative homology Hd (GLr (F2 ), GLr−1 (F2 ); F2 ) = 0 for d < 2(r − 1)/3. It
follows that Hn (GL2n (F2 ); F2 ) = 0 for all n > 4. In contrast, the non-triviality
of H1 (GL2 (F2 ); F2 ) and H2 (GL4 (F2 ); F2 ) is well-known, because of the isomorphisms GL2 (F2 ) ∼
= S3 and GL4 (F2 ) ∼
= A8 , whence the characteristic classes of the
sign and the spin representations give non-zero representatives for them. The purpose of the present text is to resolve the remaining case.
Theorem 1.1. We have H3 (GL6 (F2 ); F2 ) 6= 0.
Hepworth’s work [5, Thm. G] now implies (as Galatius, Kupers, and RandalWilliams [2, Lem. 6.7] explain again) that Theorem 1.1 automatically has the following stronger consequence:
Corollary 1.2. We have dim H3 (GL6 (F2 ); F2 ) = 1, and the non-trivial element is
the third power of the non-zero class in H1 (GL2 (F2 ); F2 ) under block-sum multiplication.

As explained in [2, Sec. 6.3] as well, Theorem 1.1 also solves the remaining case
of a problem posed by Priddy [1, Sec. 5]. A maximal elementary abelian 2–
subgroup M of the group GL2n (F2 ) consists of the block matrices
"
#
1 A
0 1
with A = (ai j ) in the matrix ring Mn (F2 ) ∼
= M. Because the group is elemen∗
tary abelian, we have an isomorphism H (M; F2 ) ∼
= F2 [ αi j ] with the classes αi j in
degree 1. The Milgram–Priddy class (see [9]) is defined as detn = det(αi j ) and
it lives in the invariants Hn (M; F2 )W , where W ∼
= GLn (F2 ) × GLn (F2 ) is the Weyl
group of M in G = GL2n (F2 ). Priddy posed the problem to decide whether or not
we can lift this class along the restriction Hn (GL2n (F2 ); F2 ) → Hn (M; F2 )W .
Corollary 1.3. The third Milgram–Priddy class lifts.
It was known before that the first and second Milgram–Priddy classes lift, and it is
a consequence of the work of Galatius, Kupers, and Randal-Williams that the third
one is the last one that has the chance to do so.
One should think that a singular result like Theorem 1.1 can be checked by computer, and this is true in theory, but currently only in theory. In practice, however,
the computational complexity of this particular problem does not allow for a brute
force approach: the group GL6 (F2 ) has order about ∼ 20 · 109 .
In the following Section 2, we explain a general strategy that we employ here to
reduce our problem to computations that can routinely be done by machine. The
computations themselves are explained in Section 3. All cohomology will be with
coefficients in the prime field F2 unless otherwise indicated.

The strategy

In this section, we explain the general strategy that we exploit in the following
section to show that certain cohomology groups Hd (GLr (F2 )) are non-zero.
The general linear group GL(V ) of a vector space V acts on the chains of subspaces
of V , with the parabolic subgroups as the stabilizer subgroups of this action. The
Borel subgroups are the stabilizers of the maximal chains, the flags. The isotropy
spectral sequence of the action on the space of these chains, the Tits building,
2

establishes a relation between the (co)homological invariants of these groups. We
will use the following result, which holds in arbitrary characteristic:
Proposition 2.1. (Webb [12, Cor. C]) Let G be a finite Chevalley group in defining
characteristic p, then
dim Hd (G) =

∑ (−1)rank(P) dim Hd (P)

P>B

for all d > 0, where the sum is over the proper parabolic subgroups of G that
contain a fixed Borel subgroup B.
This result reduces the computation of the cohomology of G = GLr (F2 ) to the
computation of the cohomology of its proper parabolic subgroups P, which are
much smaller, as we shall see.
Our aim is to show that certain cohomology groups dim Hd (GLr (F2 )) are non-zero.
This follows when we can show that their dimension is odd. (For d = n and r = 2n
we will then know that this dimension is 1, as explained in the introduction.) For
that reason, we can ignore the signs in Proposition 2.1, even though they are easy
to work out.
There is another simplification that we can do. The parabolic subgroups of a general linear group GL(V ) that contain a fixed Borel subgroup are indexed by the
ordered partitions λ = (λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λk ) of λ1 + λ2 + · · · + λk = dim(V ): the dimensions of the associated graded pieces of the chain that corresponds to the subgroup.
We shall write P(λ ) for the parabolic subgroup of an ordered partition λ . There is
an obvious involution
λ = (λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λk ) 7→ (λk , λk−1 , . . . , λ1 ) = λ ∨
∼ P(λ ) of
on the set of ordered partitions, and we have an isomorphism P(λ ∨ ) =
∨
groups. Therefore, the ordered partitions λ with λ 6= λ come in pairs that do not
contribute to the parity of dim Hd (GLr (F2 )). This shows that it is enough to compute dim Hd (P(λ )) for the symmetric ordered partitions λ of r, those with λ ∨ = λ ,
and there are substantially fewer of those.
In summary, we have:
Proposition 2.2.
dim Hd (GLr (F2 )) ≡ ∑ dim Hd (P(λ )) mod 2,
λ

where the summation is over the proper (λ 6= (r) that is) symmetric ordered partitions of r.

We see that the left hand side dim Hd (GLr (F2 )) is non-zero once we have shown
that the right hand side is odd.

The computations

In this section, we explain the computations needed as an input for the arguments
in the previous section to imply our main results.

3.1

The second Milgram–Priddy class

Let us warm up by applying the strategy outlined in the previous section to show
that the second Milgram–Priddy class in H2 (GL4 (F2 )) is non-zero. Of course,
there is an isomorphism GL4 (F2 ) ∼
= A8 , and the non-triviality of its second mod 2
cohomology is well-known. The point here is to explain our strategy of computation in a known case.
For the group GL4 (F2 ), there are only three relevant proper parabolic subgroups
that contain the Borel subgroup, which is a 2–Sylow subgroup: these subgroups
correspond to the symmetric ordered partitions (1, 1, 1, 1), (1, 2, 1), and (2, 2) of
the 4–element set {1, 2, 3, 4}. The parabolic subgroup corresponding to the first
one is the Borel–Sylow, the parabolic subgroup corresponding to the last one is the
Milgram–Priddy subgroup.
We can compute the three relevant cohomology groups using the GAP package
HAP (see [3] and [4]).
Proposition 3.1. The second mod 2 cohomology of the proper parabolic subgroups
of GL4 (F2 ) is as follows.
symmetric partition λ
(1, 1, 1, 1)
(1, 2, 1)
(2, 2)

order of the group P(λ )
64 = 26
192 = 26 · 3
576 = 26 · 9

dim H2 (P(λ ); F2 )
7

Note that all of these subgroup are considerable smaller than the full general linear
group GL4 (F2 ), which is of order 20.160 = 26 · 315.

We check that the sum ±7 ± 4 ± 4 is odd. As explained in the previous section, this
implies that H2 (GL4 (F2 )) is non-zero.

3.2

The third Milgram–Priddy class

We now complete the proof of our main result, Theorem 1.1.
In order to show that the third Milgram–Priddy class is non-zero, we follow the
same workflow as in Section 3.1. Only the computational complexity increases
because of the size of the group GL6 (F2 ).
Of the 32 ordered partitions of the 6–element set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, only 8 are
symmetric, namely (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2, 1, 1), (1, 2, 2, 1), (1, 4, 1), (2, 1, 1, 2),
(2, 2, 2), (3, 3), and (6). The parabolic subgroup corresponding to the first one is
the Borel, which is also a 2–Sylow subgroup of GL6 (F2 ). The parabolic subgroup
corresponding to the last one is GL6 (F2 ) itself and not proper.
For our strategy to work, we need to know the third mod 2 cohomology of the 7
proper parabolic subgroups, and these are small enough so that they can be dealt
with by a machine. Again, we used the GAP package HAP for that (see [3] and [4]).
The result is as follows.
Proposition 3.2. The third mod 2 cohomology of the proper parabolic subgroups
of GL6 (F2 ) is as follows.
symmetric partition λ
(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
(1, 1, 2, 1, 1)
(1, 2, 2, 1)
(1, 4, 1)
(2, 1, 1, 2)
(2, 2, 2)
(3, 3)

order of the group P(λ )
32.768 = 215
98.304 = 215 · 3
294.912 = 215 · 9
10.321.920 = 215 · 315
294.912 = 215 · 9
884.736 = 215 · 27
14.450.688 = 215 · 441

dim H3 (P(λ ); F2 )
47
28
16
5
24
17
6

The table also displays the size of the proper parabolic subgroups, and we
see that they are substantially smaller than the group GL6 (F2 ), which is of
order 20.158.709.760 = 215 · 615.195.

Proof of Theorem 1.1. The sum ±47 ± 28 ± 16 ± 5 ± 24 ± 17 ± 6 is odd. Propositions 2.2 and 3.2 thus imply that dim H3 (GL6 (F2 )) has to be odd as well. Theorem 1.1 follows.
A recent paper [6] by Johnson-Freyd and Treumann contains information about the
third homology of some sporadic finite (simple) groups.
