Alexandre Quesney

Abstract
We extend some results of Bonahon-Wong, Bullock and Turaev concerning the skein algebras of closed surfaces to Lê’s stated skein algebra
associated to open surfaces. We prove that the stated skein algebra with
deforming parameter +1 embeds canonically into the center of the stated
skein algebra whose deforming parameter is an odd root unity. We also
construct an isomorphism between the stated skein algebra at +1 and the
algebra of regular function of a generalization of the SL2 -character variety
of the surface. As a result, we associate to each isomorphism class of irreducible or local representations of the stated skein algebra, an invariant
which is a point in the character variety.

Introduction

A punctured surface is a pair Σ = (Σ, P), where Σ is a compact oriented surface
and P is a (possibly empty) finite subset of Σ which intersects non-trivially each
boundary component. We write ΣP := Σ\P. The set ∂Σ\P consists of a disjoint
union of open arcs which we call boundary arcs.
Warning: In this paper, the punctured surface Σ will be called open if the
surface Σ has non empty boundary and closed if Σ is closed. This convention
differs from the traditional one, where some authors refer to open punctured
surface a punctured surface Σ = (Σ, P) with Σ closed and P 6= ∅ (in which case
ΣP is not closed).
We will consider two related objects associated to a punctured surface,
namely the Kauffman-bracket skein algebra and the SL2 (C)-character variety.
These objects have been well studied in the case where the punctured surface
is closed. They were recently generalized to open punctured surfaces in such
a way that they have a nice behaviour relatively to the operation of gluing
two boundary arcs together. The goal of this paper is to extend some classical results concerning skein algebras and character varieties to the case of open
punctured surfaces. Before we state the main results, let us give a brief historical
background.

Historical background
Closed surfaces. In [CS83], Culler and Shalen defined the SL2 (C) character
variety XSL2 (M ) of a manifold M whose fundamental group is finitely generated.
This affine variety is closely related to the moduli space of flat connections on
a trivial SL2 (C) bundle over M and, therefore, it is related to Chern-Simons
topological quantum field theory, gauge theory and low-dimensional topology;
see [Lab14, Mar09, Mar16] for surveys. If Σ is a closed oriented surface, the
smooth part of XSL2 (Σ) carries a symplectic form, first defined in [AB83] in
the context of gauge theory. This symplectic structure was used by Goldman
[Gol86] to equip the algebra of regular functions C[XSL2 (Σ)] with a Poisson
bracket. A similar Poisson structure for character varieties of punctured closed
surfaces was introduced by Fock and Rosly in [FR99] (see also [AKSM02] for
an alternative construction) in the differential geometric context.
Turaev [Tur88], Hoste and Przytycki [HP92] independently defined the Kauffmanbracket skein algebra SA (Σ) as a tool to study the Jones polynomial and the
SU(2) Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev TQFTs. Skein algebras are defined for any
commutative unital ring R together with an invertible element A ∈ R× and a
closed punctured surface Σ.
Skein algebras are deformations of the algebra of regular functions of character varieties of closed punctured surfaces. In particular, this means that there is
an isomorphism of Poisson algebras between S+1 (Σ) and C[XSL2 (Σ)]. In more
details, this relies on a (non canonical) isomorphism from S+1 (Σ) to S−1 (Σ)
([Bar99]). The latter algebra carries a natural Poisson bracket (see Section 2.5).
An isomorphism of algebras between S−1 (Σ) and C[XSL2 (Σ)] was defined by
Bullock [Bul97], assuming that the skein algebra is reduced, i.e. that its nilradical is null. This latter fact was latter proved independently in [PS00] and
[CM09]. Turaev showed in [Tur91] that Bullock’s isomorphism is Poisson.
In TQFT, skein algebras appear through their non-trivial finite dimensional
representations. Skein algebras admit such representations if and only if the
parameter A is a root of unity. A recent result of Bonahon and Wong in [BW16]
states, in particular, that when A has odd order, there exists an embedding of
S+1 (Σ) into the center of SA (Σ). Since each simple representation induces
a character on the center of the skein algebra, using Bullock’s isomorphism,
one can associate to each isomorphism class of simple representation a point
in the character variety. This invariant is called the classical shadow of the
representation.
Open surfaces. In [Le18], Lê generalized the Kauffman-bracket skein algebras
to open punctured surfaces. He called it the stated skein algebra and we denote
it by Sω (Σ). It depends on an invertible element ω ∈ R× . When the surface
is closed, it coincides with the classical skein algebra with parameter A = ω −2 .
An important feature of the stated skein algebra is its behavior under gluing of
surfaces. More precisely, let a and b be two boundary arcs of an open punctured
surface Σ, and let us denote by Σ|a#b the surface obtained from Σ by gluing a
and b. Lê showed that there is an injective algebra morphism
i|a#b : Sω (Σ|a#b ) ֒→ Sω (Σ)

(1)

which is coassociative in that it does not depend on the order we glue the arcs
2

i.e. for four distinct boundary arcs a, b, c, d, one has i|a#b ◦ i|c#d = i|c#d ◦ i|a#b .
In particular, for each topological triangulation ∆ of Σ, one has an injective
morphism of algebras
i∆ : Sω (Σ) ֒→ ⊗T∈F (∆) Sω (T).

(2)

Here T denotes the triangle, i.e. a disc with three punctures on its boundary.
A punctured surface is triangulable if it can be obtained from a disjoint union
of triangles by gluing some pair of boundary arcs (=faces of triangles) together.
A topological triangulation is the data of such a union of triangles together with
the pairs of glued boundary arcs. In Equation (2), the tensor product runs over
the faces of the triangulation; see Section 2 for precise definitions.
As applications, Lê provided a simple proof that the algebra Sω (Σ) has no
zero divisor (which was proved earlier in [BW11]) and he obtained a simpler
formulation of Bonahon and Wong’s quantum trace map of [BW11].
Motivated by Lê’s construction, the first author defined in [Kor19] a generalization of character varieties to open punctured surfaces. We denote it by
XSL2 (Σ). This (relative) character variety is a Poisson affine variety which
coincides with the classical one when the surface is closed. It shares a similar
gluing property than the stated skein algebra, namely, there exist injective Poisson morphisms i|a#b : C[XSL2 (Σ|a#b )] ֒→ C[XSL2 (Σ)] and i∆ : C[XSL2 (Σ)] ֒→
⊗T∈F (∆) C[XSL2 (T)] between the Poisson algebras of regular functions. However,
the Poisson structure on C[XSL2 (Σ)] depends on a choice of an orientation o of
the boundary arcs of the punctured surface. We denote by {·, ·}o its Poisson
bracket.
Main results
Let Σ be a punctured surface. Lê’s morphism (2) embeds the skein algebra of a
triangulated surface into a tensor product of the skein algebras of the triangle.
However, it does not provide a full description of the stated skein algebra in
terms of these smaller pieces. In a first result we provide such a description; it
goes as follows. Remark that (1) endows the skein algebra of the bigon B (i.e. a
disc with two punctures on its boundary) with a bialgebra structure. It is in fact
a Hopf algebra and one can show that it is canonically isomorphic to the classical
quantum SL2 algebra Cq [SL2 ] described in [Kas95, CP95] (with q = ω −4 ). Note
also that (1) induces Hopf comodule maps: ∆L
a : Sω (Σ) → Sω (B) ⊗ Sω (Σ) and
∆R
b : Sω (Σ) → Sω (Σ) ⊗ Sω (B) obtained by gluing a bigon on a boundary arc,
a or b, of Σ; see Section 2.2 for details.
Theorem 1.1. The following sequence is exact:
∆L −σ◦∆R

i|a#b

b
0 → Sω (Σ|a#b ) −−−→ Sω (Σ) −−a−−−−−→
Sω (B) ⊗ Sω (Σ),

where σ(x ⊗ y) = y ⊗ x.
Theorem 1.1 can be reformulated using coHochschild cohomology, whose
zeroth group (see Definition 2.14 and [HPS09]) computes the skein algebra:
Sω (Σ|a#b ) ∼
= coHH0 (Cq [SL2 ],

3

a Sω (Σ)b ),

where a Sω (Σ)b is seen as a bicomodule over Cq [SL2 ] via the comodule maps ∆L
a
and ∆R
b .
Theorem 1.1 provides, for any topological triangulation ∆ of Σ, an isomorphism of algebras


Sω (Σ) ∼
= coHH0 ⊗e∈E̊(∆) Cq [SL2 ], ⊗T∈F (∆) Sω (T) ,

where the first tensor product runs over the inner edges of the triangulation
and the second over the faces of the triangulation. Hence Sω (Σ) is completely
determined by the combinatoric of the triangulation together with Sω (T) and
its appropriated structures of comodule over Cq [SL2 ]. This is a key feature in
the proofs of the next two theorems.
Our second result is a generalization to open punctured surfaces of Bonahon
and Wong’s main theorem in [BW16] in the case where the root of unity has
odd order. Given N ≥ 1, denote by TN (X) the N -th Chebyshev polynomial of
first kind.
Theorem 1.2. Suppose that Σ has at least one puncture per connected component and suppose that ω is a root of unity of odd order N > 1. There exists an
embedding
jΣ : S+1 (Σ) ֒→ Z (Sω (Σ))

of the (commutative) stated skein algebra with parameter +1 into the center
of the stated skein algebra with parameter ω. Moreover, the morphism jΣ is
characterized by the property that it sends a closed curve γ to TN (γ) and a
(N )
(N )
stated arc αεε′ to αεε′ , where αεε′ is the tangle made by stacking N parallel
copies of αεε′ on top of the others.
In Theorem 1.2, we restrict ourselves to roots of unity of odd orders for
simplicity. Similar results are expected for even orders as well, though the
proofs might be slightly more technical. Theorem 1.2 should be compared to
[LP18, Theorem 8.1]. A marked 3-manifold is a pair (M, N ) where M is an
oriented 3-manifold and N ⊂ ∂M is an oriented sub-manifold whose connected
component are diffeomorphic to [0, 1]. To such a pair and ζ ∈ C∗ , the authors of
[LP18] associate a vector space Sζ (M, N ), which generalizes the Müller algebra.
In [LP18, Theorem 8.1] and for a root of unity ζ such that ζ 4 has arbitrary
order N > 1 (not necessary odd), the authors defined an injective linear map
Φζ : S(ζ)N 2 (M, N ) ֒→ Sζ (M, N ). If (Σ, P) is a punctured surface with no inner
punctures and non-trivial boundary, (M, N ) := (Σ×(0, 1), P×(0, 1)) is a marked
3-manifold and Sζ (M, N ) is a subalgebra of the stated skein algebra Sζ (Σ, P).
If ζ has odd order N > 1, the embedding jΣ of Theorem 1.2 restricts to the
embedding Φζ of [LP18, Theorem 8.1]. T.Lê recently informed the authors that
he had proved an analogue of Theorem 1.2 in the case of roots of unity of even
order as well ([LY]).
In the last result we generalize to open punctured surfaces Bullock’s isomorphism of [Bul97] and Turaev’s theorem of [Tur91]; we prove that the stated
skein algebra is a deformation of the character variety. The fundamental result
in this direction is as follows.
The C[[~]]-module S+1 (Σ)[[~]] := S+1 (Σ) ⊗C C[[~]] is endowed with a star
product ⋆~ . The latter is obtained by pulling-back the product of S+1 (Σ)
4

∼
=

along an isomorphism S+1 (Σ)[[~]] −
→ Sω~ (Σ) of vector spaces, where ω~ :=
exp (−~/4) (see Section 2.5 for details). This equips S+1 (Σ) with a Poisson
algebra structure; its Poisson bracket {·, ·}s is defined by
f ⋆~ g − g ⋆~ f = ~{f, g}s

(mod ~2 ), for all f, g ∈ S+1 (Σ).

See Section 2.5.3 for an explicit description.
Theorem 1.3. Suppose that Σ has a topological triangulation ∆. Let o∆ be an
orientation of the edges of ∆ and o be the induced orientation of the boundary
arcs of Σ. There exists an isomorphism of Poisson algebras
∼
=

Ψ(∆,o∆ ) : (S+1 (Σ), {·, ·}s ) −
→ (C[XSL2 (Σ)], {·, ·}o ) .
Moreover, the above isomorphism exists for small punctured surfaces (see Definition 2.6), for which it only depends on o.
The isomorphism Ψ(∆,o∆ ) induces, by tensoring with C[[~]], an isomorphism
∼
=
of vector spaces C[XSL2 (Σ)][[~]] −
→ S+1 (Σ)[[~]]. Denote by ⋆(∆,o∆ ) the product
on C[XSL2 (Σ)][[~]] obtained by pulling back the product ⋆~ by this isomorphism.
Corollary 1.4. For any triangulable punctured surface Σ, the algebra
C[XSL2 (Σ)][[~]], ⋆(∆,o∆ ) is a deformation quantization of the character variety
with Poisson structure given by o.
Theorems 1.2 and 1.3 allow us to extend Bonahon and Wong’s classical
shadow [BW16] to open punctured surfaces. Indeed, suppose that ω is a root of
unity of odd order. A finite dimensional representation Sω (Σ) → End(V ) that
sends each element of the image of jΣ : S+1 (Σ) ֒→ Sω (Σ) to scalar operators,
induces a character on the algebra S+1 (Σ) ∼
= C[XSL2 (Σ)], hence defines a point
in XSL2 (Σ). To sum up, and calling central these representations, one has the
following.
Corollary 1.5. When ω is a root of unity of odd order and Σ is triangulable,
to each isomorphism class of central representations of the stated skein algebra
Sω (Σ), one can associate an invariant which is a point in the character variety
XSL2 (Σ).
Central representations include the families of irreducible representations,
local representations and representations induced by simple modules of the balanced Chekhov-Fock algebras using the quantum trace map (see Section 3.3 for
details).
Soon after the prepublication of this paper on arXiv, Costantino and Le
prepublished independently in [CL19] some results similar to Theorems 1.2 and
1.3. More precisely, [CL19, Theorem4.7] is identical to Theorem 1.1 whereas
[CL19, Theorem 8.12] is closely related, though different, to our Theorem 1.3.
Instead of using the generalized character variety XSL2 (Σ) defined in [Kor19],
the authors defined a twisted character variety χ(Σ) (without Poisson structure)
and constructed a canonical isomorphism between the stated skein algebra in
+1 and the algebra of regular functions of χ(Σ), whereas our isomorphism in
Theorem 1.3 depends on the non-canonical choice (∆, o∆ ) of a triangulation
5

and an orientation of the edges. Inspired by their enlightening approach, in this
new version of the paper we add the following clarification of the isomorphism
in Theorem 1.3. As explained before, when the punctured surface is closed
the ”standard” isomorphisms between S+1 (Σ) and C[XSL2 (Σ)] are indexed by
spin structures. In Section 3.3, we define the notion of relative spin structure for
punctured surfaces, which coincides with the standard definition when the punctured surface is closed. The motivation for this definition is its good behavior
for the operation of gluing boundary arcs together. In particular we associate
to each combinatorial data (∆, o∆ ), appearing in Theorem 1.3, a relative spin
structure and prove the
Theorem 1.6. The isomorphism Ψ(∆,o∆ ) of Theorem 1.3 only depends on the
relative spin structure associated to (∆, o).
In fact, in Theorem 3.17, we provide explicit formulas for the value of Ψ(∆,o∆)
on stated arcs and closed curves in terms of the relative spin structure. When
the punctured surface is closed, we show that our isomorphism coincides with
the standard isomorphism associated to classical spin structures. We also give,
in Section 3.3.5, a detailed comparison between the isomorphism in Theorem
1.3 and Costantino and Lê isomorphism in [CL19, Theorem 8.12].
Plan of the paper
In the second section we briefly recall from [Le18] the definition and general
properties of the stated skein algebra and prove Theorem 1.1. We then use the
triangular decomposition to reduce the proof of Theorem 1.2 to the cases of
the bigon and the triangle for which the proof is a simple computation. We
eventually characterize the Poisson bracket arising in skein theory. In the third
section, we briefly recall from [Kor19] the definition of character varieties for
open surfaces. Again, using triangular decompositions, we reduce the proof of
Theorem 1.3 to the cases of the bigon and the triangles for which the proof is
elementary. We then introduce and study the notion of relative spin structure
and give in Theorem 3.17 an explicit description of the isomorphism of 1.3, from
which Theorem 1.6 is a straightforward consequence. In the appendix, we prove
a technical result needed in the proof of Theorem 1.2 and derive a generalization
of the main theorem of [Bon17].

Stated skein algebras

2.1

Definitions and general properties of the stated skein
algebras

We briefly review from [Le18] the definition and main properties of the stated
skein algebras.
Definition 2.1. A punctured surface is a pair Σ = (Σ, P) where Σ is a compact
oriented surface and P is a finite subset of Σ which intersects non-trivially each
boundary component. A boundary arc is a connected component of ∂Σ\ P. The
punctured surface is open when ∂Σ 6= ∅ and closed otherwise.
Let Σ = (Σ, P) be a punctured surface and write ΣP := Σ \ P. A tangle
in ΣP × (0, 1) is a compact framed, properly embedded 1-dimensional manifold
T ⊂ ΣP × (0, 1) such that for every point of ∂T ⊂ ∂ΣP × (0, 1) the framing is
parallel to the (0, 1) factor and points to the direction of 1. Here, by framing,
we refer to a thickening of T to an oriented surface. Define the height of a point
(v, h) ∈ ΣP × (0, 1) to be h. If b is a boundary arc and T a tangle, the points
of ∂b T := ∂T ∩ b × (0, 1) are totally ordered by their height and we impose that
no two points in ∂b T have the same height. A tangle has vertical framing if for
each of its points, the framing is parallel to the (0, 1) factor and points in the
direction of 1. Two tangles are isotopic if they are isotopic through the class of
tangles that preserves the partial boundary height orders. By convention, the
empty set is a tangle only isotopic to itself.
Every tangle is isotopic to a tangle with vertical framing. We can further
isotope a tangle such that it is in general position with the standard projection
π : ΣP × (0, 1) → ΣP with π(v, h) = v, that is such that π : T → ΣP is an
T

immersion with at most transversal double points in the interior of ΣP . We
call diagram of T the image D = π(T ) together with the over/undercrossing
information at each double point. An isotopy class of diagram D together with
a total order of ∂b D = ∂D ∩ b for each boundary arc b, define uniquely an
isotopy class of tangle. When choosing an orientation o(b) of a boundary arc
b and a diagram D, the set ∂b D receives a natural order by setting that the
points are increasing when going in the direction of o(b). We will represent
tangles by drawing a diagram and an orientation (an arrow) for each boundary
arc. When a boundary arc b is oriented we assume that ∂b D is ordered according
to the orientation. The data of an isotopy class of diagram and a choice o of
orientations of the boundary arcs define uniquely an isotopy class of tangle. A
state of a tangle is a map s : ∂T → {−, +}. A couple (T, s) is called a stated
tangle. We define a stated diagram (D, s) in a similar manner.
Let R be a commutative unital ring and ω ∈ R× an invertible element.
Definition 2.2. The stated skein algebra Sω (Σ) is the free R-module generated
by isotopy classes of stated tangles in ΣP × (0, 1) modulo the relations (3) and
(4), which are,
the Kauffman bracket relations:

The product of two classes of stated tangles [T1 , s1 ] and [T2 , s2 ] is defined by
isotoping T1 and T2 in ΣP × (1/2, 1) and ΣP × (0, 1/2) respectively and then
setting [T1 , s1 ] · [T2 , s2 ] = [T1 ∪ T2 , s1 ∪ s2 ].
A closed component of a diagram D is trivial if it bounds an embedded disc
in ΣP . An open component of D is trivial if it can be isotoped, relatively to
its boundary, inside some boundary arc. A diagram is simple if it has neither
double points nor trivial component. The empty set is considered as a simple
diagram. Let o be an orientation of the boundary arcs of Σ and denote by ≤o
the total orders induced on each boundary arc. A state s : ∂D → {−, +} is
o−increasing if for any boundary arc b and any points x, y ∈ ∂b D, then x <o y
implies s(x) < s(y). Here we choose the convention − < +.
Definition 2.3. We denote by B o ⊂ Sω (Σ) the set of classes of stated diagrams
[D, s] such that D is simple and s is o-increasing.
By [Le18, Theorem 2.11], the set B o is an R-module basis of Sω (Σ).
Important properties that we will use all along the paper are the following
height exchange moves (5) and (6) proved in [Le18, Lemma 2.4]. Note that the
formula (20) of Lemma 2.4 of loc. cit. contains a misprint. It is corrected here
in (6).

Remark 2.4. An important case that we will be led to consider is the stated
skein algebra at parameter ω = +1. As shown in [Le18, Corollary 2.5] it is commutative; this is a direct consequence of (3) and the height exchange formulas
(5) and (6).
Suppose that Σ has two boundary arcs, say a and b. Let Σ|a#b be the
punctured surface obtained from Σ by gluing a and b. Denote by π : ΣP →
(Σ|a#b )P|a#b the projection and c := π(a) = π(b). Let (T0 , s0 ) be a stated framed
tangle of Σ|a#b P
× (0, 1) transversed to c × (0, 1) and such that the heights
|a#b

of the points of T0 ∩ c × (0, 1) are pairwise distinct and such that framings of the
points of c×(0, 1) are vertical. Let T ⊂ ΣP ×(0, 1) be the framed
tangle F
obtained
F
by cutting T0 along c. Using the partition ∂T = ∂a T π −1 (∂T0 ) ∂b T , a
state on T can be written (sa , s, sb ) where sa , s and sb are states on ∂a T , ∂T0
and ∂b T respectively. Both the sets ∂a T and ∂b T are in canonical bijection
with the set T0 ∩ c by the map π. Hence the two sets of states sa and sb are
both in canonical bijection with the set St(c) := {s : c ∩ T0 → {−, +}}. Let
i|a#b : Sω (Σ|a#b ) → Sω (Σ) be the linear map given, for any (T0 , s0 ) as above,
by:
X
[T, (s, s0 , s)].
i|a#b ([T0 , s0 ]) :=
s∈St(c)

8

Theorem 2.5. [Le18, Theorem 3.1] The linear map i|a#b is an injective morphism of algebras. Moreover the gluing operation is coassociative in the sense
that if a, b, c, d are four distinct boundary arcs, then we have i|a#b ◦ i|c#d =
i|c#d ◦ i|a#b .
Definition 2.6. A small punctured surface is one of the following four connected punctured surfaces: the sphere with one or two punctures; the disc with
only one puncture (on its boundary); the bigon (disc with two punctures on its
boundary).
Definition 2.7. A punctured surface is said to admit a triangulation if each of
its connected components has at least one puncture and is not small.
Definition 2.8. Suppose Σ = (Σ, P) admits a triangulation. A topological
triangulation ∆ of Σ is a collection E(∆) of arcs in Σ (named edges) which
satisfy the following conditions: the endpoints of the edges belong to P; the
interior of the edges are pairwise disjoint and do not intersect P; the edges are
not contractible and are pairwise non isotopic in ΣP , if fixed their endpoints; the
boundary arcs of Σ belong to E(∆). Moreover, the collection E(∆) is required
to be maximal for these properties.
Each connected component of Σ \ E(∆) is called a face and the set of faces is
denoted by F (∆). Given a topological
F triangulation ∆, the punctured surface is
obtained from the disjoint union T∈F (∆) T of triangles by gluing the triangles
along the boundary arcs corresponding to the edges of the triangulation. Very
often, we will let T be both a face (which is an open contractible space) and
the triangle (which is a disc with exactly three punctures on its boundary).
We hope that this abuse of notation is harmless. By composing the associated
gluing maps, one obtains an injective morphism of algebras:
i∆ : Sω (Σ) ֒→ ⊗T∈F (∆) Sω (T).
The stated skein algebra has natural filtrations defined as follows. Let
S = {a1 , . . . , an } be a set of boundary arcs of Σ and fix an orientation o of
the boundary arcs of Σ. For a basis element [D, s] of B o , write d([D, s]) :=
P
≥0
by the formula
a∈S ∂a D . The map d extends to a map d : Sω (Σ) → Z
P
d( i xi [Di , si ]) := maxi|xi 6=0 d([Di , si ]). It follows from the relations (3) and (4)
that for each x, y ∈ Sω (Σ), we have d(xy) ≤ d(x)+d(y). Given m ≥ 0, denote by
Fm ⊂ Sω (Σ) the sub-vector space of thoseSvectors x satisfying d(x) ≤ m. These
sub-spaces satisfy Fm ⊂ Fm+1 , Sω (Σ) = m≥0 Fm and Fm1 · Fm2 ⊂ Fm1 +m2 ,
hence they form an algebra filtration of the stated skein algebra.
Definition 2.9. The sequence (Fm )m≥0 is called the filtration of Sω (Σ) associated
P to the orientation o and the set S of boundary arcs. For an element
X = i∈I xi [Di , si ] ∈ Sω (Σ), developed in the basis B o , we call leading term
of X the element:
X
xj [Dj , sj ].
lt(X) :=
j∈I|d([Dj ,sj ])=d(X)

2.2

Hopf comodule maps

Recall that the bigon B is a disc with two punctures on its boundary. It has
two boundary arcs, say bL and bR . Consider the simple diagram α made of a
9

single arc joining bL and bR . For n ≥ 0, denote by α(n) the diagram made of
n parallel copies of α. Denote by αεε′ the class in Sω (B) of the stated diagram
(α, s) where s(α ∩ bL ) = ε and s(α ∩ bR ) = ε′ . Fix an arbitrary orientation oB
of bL and bR . It is proved in [Le18, Theorem 4.1] that the stated skein algebra

The map ∆ is characterized by the formula ∆(αεε′ ) = (αε+ ⊗ α+ε′ ) + (αε− ⊗

formulas ǫ(αεε′ ) = δεε′ , S(α++ ) = α−− , S(α−− ) = α++ , S(α+− ) = −qα+− and
S(α−+ ) = −q −1 α−+ . The coproduct ∆, the counit ǫ and the antipode S endow Sω (B) with a structure of Hopf algebra. This Hopf algebra is canonically
isomorphic to the so-called quantum SL2 Hopf algebra Cq [SL2 ] as defined in
([Man88], [Kas95] Chapter IV Section 6, [CP95] Definition 7.1.1).

The image of the gluing map

All along this subsection, we fix a punctured surface Σ and an orientation o of
its boundary arcs.
Notations 2.10. For a boundary arc a and a diagram D, we write na (D) :=
|∂a D|. Given n ≥ 1, define the set St(n) := {−, +}n and the subset St↑ (n) ⊂
St(n) which consists of n-tuples (ε1 , . . . , εn ) such that i < j implies εi ≤ εj .
If s = (ε1 , . . . , εn ) ∈ St(n), denote by s↑ = (ε′1 , . . . , ε′n ) ∈ St↑ (n) the unique
element such that the number of indices i such that εi = + is equal to the
number of indices j such that ε′j = +. Given s = (ε1 , . . . , εn ) ∈ St(n), denote
by k(s) the number of pairs (i, j) such that i < j and εi > εj . For s ∈ St↑ (n),
let

Let a and b be two boundary arcs of Σ and consider the filtration associated
to S := {a, b} and o.
Lemma 2.11. Let (D, s) be an o-oriented simple stated diagram and consider
v1 , v2 two points which both belong either to ∂a D or to ∂b D. Suppose that
v1 <o v2 and that there is no v ∈ ∂D such that v1 <o v <o v2 . Further
assume that s(v1 ) = + and s(v2 ) = −. Let s′ be the state of D such that
s′ (v1 ) = −, s′ (v2 ) = + and s′ (v) = s(v) if v ∈ ∂D\{v1 , v2 }. One has lt([D, s]) =
q lt([D, s′ ]).
Proof. This is a straightforward consequence of the boundary relations (4) and
the height exchange formulas (5) and (6).
Let (D, s) be an o-oriented simple stated diagram of Σ and write s =
(sa , s0 , sb ) as above. It results from Lemma 2.11 that we have the equality:
lt([D, (sa , s0 , sb )]) = q k(sa )+k(sb ) lt([D, (s↑a , s0 , s↑b )]).
Fix an orientation oB of the boundary
arcs of the bigon. Consider the filF
tration of Sω (B) ⊗ Sω (Σ) ∼
= Sω (Σ B) associated to the set of boundary arcs
S ′ := {bL , bR , a, b} and the orientations o and oB . Given X ′ ∈ Sω (B)⊗Sω (Σ), we
denote by lt′ (X ′ ) the associated leading term. By definition of the left comodule
map, we have the formula:
X
[α(na (D)) , (sa , s)] ⊗ [D, (s, s0 , sb )]
∆L
a ([D, (sa , s0 , sb )]) =
s∈St(na (D))

The inclusion Im(i|a#b ) ⊂ ker(∆L

then X is a linear combination of diagrams which do not intersect a and b,
hence X belongs to the image of i|a#b . Suppose that lt(X) > 0. We will find an
element Y ∈ Sω (Σ|a#b ) such that lt(i|a#b (Y )) = lt(X). Hence X will belong to
the image of i|a#b if and only if Z := X − i|a#b (Y ) belongs to this image. Since
lt(Z) < lt(X), the proof will follow by induction on lt(X).

From the equality lt′ (∆L

(D, s0 ) ∈ Dmax , for any pair (sa , sb ) ∈ StX ((D, s0 )) and for any state s ∈

such that:

x[D,(sa ,s0 ,sb )] Hs (q)[α(na (D)) , (sa , s)] ⊗ [D, (s, s0 , sb )]
= x[D,(s′a ,s0 ,s′b )] Hs′ (q)[α(nb (D)) , (s′ , sb )] ⊗ [D, (sa , s0 , s′ )].

By the above expression, we have the equality lt(X) = lt(i|a#b (Y )). This
concludes the proof.
Consider a topological triangulationF∆ of Σ. The punctured surface Σ is
obtained from the disjoint union Σ∆ := T∈F (∆) T by gluing the triangles along
˚
their common edges. Denote by E(∆)
⊂ E(∆) the subset of edges which are not
˚
boundary arcs. Each edge e ∈ E(∆) lifts in Σ∆ to two boundary arcs eL and
eR . By composing all the left comodule maps ∆L
eL together (the order does not
matter) one gets a Hopf comodule map

∆L : ⊗T∈F (∆)Sω (T) → ⊗e∈E̊(∆) Sω (B) ⊗ ⊗T∈F (∆)Sω (T) .

Proof. Theorem 1.1 applied to each inner edge provides an isomorphism between
R
Sω (Σ) and the intersection, over the inner edges e, of Ker(∆L
eL − σ ◦ ∆eR ). We
conclude by observing that the latter intersection is Ker(∆L − σ ◦ ∆R ).
We can reformulate the above exact sequence in terms of coHochschild cohomology.
Definition 2.14. Given a coalgebra C with a bi-comodule M , with comodules
maps ∆L : M → A ⊗ M and ∆R : M → M ⊗ A, the 0-th coHochschild
cohomology group is coHH0 (A, M ) := ker ∆L − σ ◦ ∆R .

The center of stated skein algebras at odd roots of

Here we prove Theorem 1.2. We prove it for the bigon, then for the triangle,
and we conclude with the general case. Let us start by the following classical
result.
Lemma 2.15. Let R be a ring and q ∈ R× a root of unity of order N > 1.
Suppose that A is an R-algebra and x, y ∈ A are such that yx = qxy. One has

2.4.1

The case of the bigon

Definition 2.16. Let Rq [M2 ] be the following bi-algebra. As an algebra, it is
generated by elements αεε′ with relations:
α++ α+− = q −1 α+− α++

α++ α−+ = q −1 α−+ α++

α−− α+− = qα+− α−−

α−− α−+ = qα−+ α−−

α++ α−− − α−− α++ = (q

−1

− q)α+− α−+

α−+ α+− = α+− α−+

The counit and coproduct are given successively by ǫ(αεε′ ) = δεε′ , ∆(αεε′ ) =
αε+ ⊗α+ε′ +αε− ⊗α−ε′ and S(α++ ) = α−− , S(α−− ) = α++ , S(α+− ) = −qα+− ,
S(α−+ ) = −q −1 α−+ .
Note that the element detq := α++ α−− − q −1 α+− α−+ is central and grouplike. The Hopf algebra Sω (B) is isomorphic the quotient of Rq [M2 ] by the ideal
generated by (detq −1).
Lemma 2.17. Suppose that q is a root of unity of odd order N > 1.
1. The set B := {αa++ αb+− αc−+ αd−− , a, b, c, d ≥ 0} is a basis of Rq [M2 ].
′
2. The elements αN
εε′ , for ε, ε = ±, are central in Rq [M2 ].
N
N
N
N
3. One has the equality detN
q = α++ α−− − α+− α−+ .

Proof. The fact that B is a basis of Rq [M2 ] is an easy application of the Diamond Lemma for PBW bases of quadratic algebras (see e.g. [LV12, Proposition
4.3.12]). First order the set of generators by α++ < α+− < α−+ < α−− .
The relations of Rq [M2 ] induce the rewriting rules α++ α−− → α−− α++ +
(q −1 − q)α+− α−+ , α+− α−+ → α−+ α+− , α++ α+− → q −1 α+− α++ , α++ α−+ →
q −1 α−+ α++ , α+− α−− → q −1 α−− α+− and α−+ α−− → q −1 α−− α−+ . The critical monomials are α+− α−+ α−− , α++ α+− α−− and α++ α−+ α−− . We then
14

check that the associated graphs are confluents. For the critical monomial
α+− α−+ α−− , the graph is:
α+− α−+ α−−

α−+ α+− α−−

q −1 α+− α−− α−+

q −1 α−+ α−− α+−

q −2 α−− α+− α−+
q −2 α−− α−+ α+−

This graph is obviously confluent. The confluence of the graphs associated to
the critical monomials α++ α+− α−− and α++ α−+ α−− are proved similarly and
left to the reader. The Diamond Lemma [LV12, Proposition 4.3.12] implies that
B is a (Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt) basis of Rq [M2 ].

We first prove Theorem 1.2 for the bigon.
Lemma 2.18. Suppose that q := ω −4 is a root of unity of odd order N >
1. There exists a injective morphism of Hopf algebras jB : S+1 (B) → Sω (B)
characterized by jB (αεε′ ) := (αεε′ )N whose image lies in the center of Sω (B).
Proof. Since the algebra S+1 (B) is the quotient of the free algebra R+1 [M2 ]
by the ideal (det −1) the existence of an algebra morphism jB : S+1 (B) →
Sω (B), characterized by jB (αεε′ ) := (αεε′ )N , follows from the second and third
assertions of Lemma 2.17.
Let us prove that jB is a morphism of bialgebras, hence a morphism of
Hopf algebras. This is done by a direct inspection on each generator; for α++
it is as follows. Recall that ∆(α++ ) = α++ ⊗ α++ + α+− ⊗ α−+ and write
x := α++ ⊗ α++ and y := α+− ⊗ α−+ . Since xy = q −2 yx in Sω (B)⊗2 and
q 2N = 1, by Lemma 2.15 one has (x + y)N = xN + y N . Therefore one has
jB ⊗ jB (∆(α++ )) = ∆(jB (α++ )). The other cases are similar.
It remains to prove the injectivity of jB . Consider an orientation o of the
boundary arcs of B such that both bL and bR point towards the same puncture.
The basis B o of Sω (B) given by Definition 2.3 consists in the set of vectors
′
′
′
αa++ αb+− αc−− and αa++ αb−+ αc−− for which a, b, c, a′ , b′ , c′ ≥ 0 and b′ 6= 0. Since
B o is also a basis of S+1 (B), it follows from the definition of jB that it is injective.

Lemma 2.20. Suppose that ω is a root of unity of odd order N > 1. There
exists an injective morphism of algebras jT : S+1 (T) → Sω (T), whose image lies
in the center of Sω (T), characterized by jT (δεε′ ) := (δεε′ )N for δ ∈ {α, β, γ}
and ε, ε′ = ±. Moreover, if a is a boundary arc of T, the following diagrams
commute:

Proof. We proceed in a similar way than Lemma 2.18, by showing first that the
N
extension of the assignment jT (δεε′ ) := δεε
′ to a morphism of algebras is welldefined. In virtue of Lemma 2.19 and by the rotation automorphism, it is enough
17

to show that αN
εε′ lies in the center of Sω (T) and that jT sends det(Mα ) − 1 and
Mγ CMβ CMα C − 1 to zero.
First remark that the relations (7) and (8) put together coincide with the
defining relations of Sω (B), hence one has an inclusion of algebras φ : Sω (B) ֒→
Sω (T) defined by φ(αεε′ ) = αεε′ . By applying Lemma 2.18, one obtains an
inclusion φ ◦ jB : S+1 (B) ֒→ Sω (T) which coincides with jT on the αεε′ ’s. It
remains to show that the αN
εε′ ’s commute with the βµµ′ ’s and the γµµ′ ’s, and
that jT vanishes on Mγ CMβ CMα C − 1.

The case ε = − and µ′ = + is handled similarly.
Now let us prove that jT is injective. To this end, let us consider the following
basis of Sω (T).
Consider the counter-clockwise orientation o of the boundary arcs of T as
in Figure 1. Given k = (kα , kβ , kγ ) ∈ (Z≥0 )3 , denote by θk the (not simple)
18

diagram αkα β kβ γ kγ ; see Figure 1 for an example. It is proven in [Le18, Proof
of Theorem 4.6] that the set of classes [θk , s], where s is o-increasing, forms a
basis of Sω (T).
By construction, jT sends the elements [θk , s] of S+1 (T), where s is oincreasing, to some basis elements [θN k , s′ ], where s′ is also o increasing, therefore jT is injective.
The proof that jT is a morphism of Hopf comodules is similar to the proof
in Lemma 2.18 of the fact that jB is a morphism of Hopf algebras and is left to
the reader. This concludes the proof.

2.4.3

The general case: proof of Theorem 1.2

In this section we prove Theorem 1.2; we do this in five steps.
In Step 1, we show that the decomposition Theorem 1.1 together with the
two previous sections provide an injective morphism of algebras
j(Σ,∆) : S+1 (Σ) ֒→ Sω (Σ),

(12)

which is central. We study further properties of j(Σ,∆) and we show that it is
does not depend on a topological triangulation ∆. The other steps are devoted
to making explicit the morphism j(Σ,∆) on arcs and loops. In Step 2 to 4, we
suppose that the punctured surface has a non-degenerated triangulation (see
below); in Step 5 we treat the other punctured surfaces.
In Step 2, we prove that j(Σ,∆) sends the stated arcs that have their endpoints on two different boundary arcs of Σ, to their N -th power.
In Step 3, we prove that j(Σ,∆) sends some particular closed curves of ΣP
to their N -th Chebyshev polynomial of first kind.
Step 4 is more involved. We first prove a structural result. Adding a puncture on a surface Σ gives rise to a surjective map from the skein algebra of the
new punctured surface to that of the initial one. We show that j(Σ,∆) commutes
with these surjections (see Proposition 2.28). This uses results of the previous
steps. From this, we prove that j(Σ,∆) sends the stated arcs that have their
endpoints on one boundary arc of Σ to their N -th power, and we prove that it
sends any closed curve of ΣP to its N -th Chebyshev polynomial of first kind.
In Step 5, we treat the remaining cases of connected punctured surfaces that
do not admit a non-degenerated topological triangulation.
These five steps prove Theorem 1.2.
All along this section, Σ is a punctured surface, ∆ a topological triangulation
Σ and ω a root of unity of odd order N > 1. Except for Step 1 and 5, the
triangulation ∆ is required to be non-degenerated, that is, such that each of its
inner edges separates two distinct faces.

The existence of an injective morphism j(Σ,∆) : S+1 (Σ) ֒→ Sω (Σ) follows from
the exactness of the lines and the injectivity of ⊗T∈F (∆)jT . Moreover, since jT
is central, so is j(Σ,∆) .
Let us show that j(Σ,∆) is compatible with the gluing maps.
Lemma 2.21. If a and b are two boundary arcs of Σ, the following diagram
commutes:

The outer triangles commute by coassociativity of the gluing maps. Two of the
three squares commute by Diagram (13). Since i∆ is injective, the remaining
(left-hand side) square commutes.
We now prove that the morphism j(Σ,∆) does not depend on ∆. We first
need a preliminary result.
Lemma 2.22. Let Q be a square (i.e. a disc with four punctures on its boundary) and ∆Q a topological triangulation of Q. If αεε′ ∈ Sω (Q) is the class of a
stated arc, then j(Q,∆Q ) (αεε′ ) = αN
εε′ . In particular, j(Q,∆Q ) does not depend on
∆Q .
Proof. Let e be the inner edge of ∆Q which is a common boundary arc of two
triangles T1 and T2 . Make the intersection α ∩ e transversal and minimal via
an isotopy on α. If the intersection is empty, then α is included in one of the
triangles and the lemma follows from Lemma 2.20. If α ∩ e is not empty, then
it has only one element. Therefore, by letting αTi := α ∩ Ti for i = 1, 2, one has

and remark that xy = q −2 yx. By Lemma 2.15 one has
∆Q
(αεε′ )N = (x + y)N = xN + y N = (jT1 ⊗ jT2 ) ◦ i∆Q (αεε′ ).
i∆Q (αN
εε′ ) = i

Hence one has the equality j(Q,∆Q ) (αεε′ ) = αN
εε′ .
Lemma 2.23. The morphism j(Σ,∆) does not depend on ∆.
Proof. Every two triangulations can be related by a finite sequence of flips on
the edges. Therefore, it is enough to prove that if ∆′ differs from ∆ by a flip of
one edge, then j(Σ,∆) = j(Σ,∆′ ) .
Let e be an inner edge of ∆ that bounds two distinct faces T1 and T2 .
Consider the topological triangulation ∆′ obtained from ∆ by flipping the edge
e inside the square Q = T1 ∪ T2 . Let i : Sω (Σ) ֒→ Sω (Σ \ Q) ⊗ Sω (Q) be the
gluing morphism. By Lemma 2.22, the morphism jQ : S+1 (Q) ֒→ Sω (Q) does
not depend on the triangulation of Q. Therefore, by Lemma 2.21, both the
morphisms j(Σ,∆) and j(Σ,∆′ ) make the following diagram commutative:
S+1 (Σ)
j(Σ,∆′ )

Sω (Σ \ Q) ⊗ S+1 (Q).

This proves that j(Σ,∆) = j(Σ,∆′ ) and concludes the proof.

Step 2: arcs with endpoints in distinct boundary arcs.
Lemma 2.24. If αεε′ ∈ Sω (Σ) is the class of a stated arc such that its endpoints
lie on two different boundary arcs, then jΣ (αεε′ ) = αN
εε′ .
Proof. In virtue of Diagram (13), it is enough to prove that
∆
i∆ (αN
εε′ ) = (⊗T∈F (∆) jT )i (αεε′ ).

(14)

Without lost of generality, we suppose that the arc α is in minimal and
transverse position with the edges of ∆. Let T be a (vertical framed) tangle of
ΣP × (0, 1) that projects on α and such that its height projection is an injective
map. Note that for each T ∈ F (∆), the tangle TT := T ∩ T may have various
connected components; since the height projection is injective, these components
are ordered by height. Let T (N ) be a tangle of N parallel copies of T obtained
by stacking N copies of T , but close enough to have the following property. For
each T ∈ F (∆), if T1 and T2 are two connected components of TT such that T1
(N )
is below T2 , then, in TT := T (N ) ∩ T, each copy of T1 is below all the copies of
T2 . See Figure 2 for an illustration. Note that since α is an arc with boundary
points at two distinct boundary arcs, the tangle T (N ) is a representative of the
N -th product of αεε′ in Sω (Σ); otherwise it may not be true.
The left-hand term of (14) can be described as the cutting of T (N ) along
each edge of the triangulation, and summing the result over all possible states
at each edge. More formally, it is described as follows.

21

(N )

Let K be a subset of edges of ∆ that intersect α. We let StK (α) be the set of
maps s : T ∩ (K × (0, 1)) → {−, +}. Note that StK (α) = ⊔e∈K St{e} (α), which
allows us to write s ∈ StK (α) as ⊔se . We will only consider the two sets K: the
set E of all the internal edges of ∆ that intersect α, and the set K = {e} for
an edge e.
For s ∈ StE (α), write s(N ) := (s, . . . , s) ∈ StE (α)×N . We denote by s0 the
state of αεε′ (so, one has αεε′ = [T, s0 ]).
For s = (s1 , . . . , sN ) ∈ StE (α)×N , we let
(N )

α(s) := ⊗T∈F (∆) [TT

(N )

, (s ⊔ s0 )|∂T ] ∈ ⊗T∈F (∆) Sω (T),
(N )

where we associate, to the k-th copy of TT , the restriction of the state sk .
With this notation, the left-hand term of (14) can be written as
X
i∆ (αN
α(s).
(15)
εε′ ) =
s∈StE (α)×N

Now, let us describe the right-hand term of (14). Note that the construction of T (N ) ensures that, for each triangle T and each state s of TT , one has
(N )
jT ([TT , s]) = [TT , s(N ) ]. Therefore, one has
X

α(s(N ) ).
(16)
⊗T∈F (∆) jT i∆ (αεε′ ) =
s∈StE (α)

Let Y be the set of non-diagonal states StE (α)×N \ {(s, ..., s)|s ∈ StE (α)}.
The sum in (15) and in (16) differ by the sum of α(s) for s ∈ Y .
Let us fix an edge e of E and let us split Y into J ⊔ Ye where Ye is the set of
N -tuples of states at e, that is, Ye = {s ∈ Y | s : T (N ) ∩ (e × (0, 1)) → {−, +}}.
Therefore, showing (14) amounts to showing that
X X
α(s′ ⊔ s) = 0.
s′ ∈J s∈Ye

P
In fact, let us show that, for each s′ ∈ J, one has s∈Ye α(s′ ⊔ s) = 0.
Let T1 and T2 be the two triangles adjoining e and let Q ⊂ ΣP be the
resulting square. Denote by iQ : Sω (Q) ֒→ ⊗T∈F (∆)Sω (T) the corresponding
embedding and write TQ := T ∩ (Q × (0, 1)) . For each s′ ∈ J, one has

The last term is zero by Lemma 2.22. This concludes the proof.

Step 3: closed curves that intersect ∆ nicely.
Definition 2.25. The N -th Chebyshev polynomial of first kind is the polynomial TN (X) ∈ Z[X] defined by the recursive formulas T0 (X) = 2, T1 (X) = X
and Tn+2 (X) = XTn+1 (X) − Tn (X) for n ≥ 0.
The following proposition is at the heart of (our proof of) the so-called
”miraculous cancelations” from [BW16]. We postpone its proof to the Appendix
A.
Proposition 2.26. If ω is a root of unity of odd order N ≥ 1, then in Sω (B),
the following equality holds:
N
TN (α++ + α−− ) = αN
++ + α−− .

Lemma 2.27. Let γ ∈ Sω (Σ) be the class of a closed curve. If the closed curve
can be chosen such that it intersects an edge of ∆ once and only once, then
jΣ (γ) = TN (γ).
Proof. Consider the punctured surface Σ(e) obtained from Σ by replacing e
by two arcs e′ and e′′ parallel to e with the same endpoints and removing the
bigone between e′ and e′′ . Consider the injective morphism i|e′ #e′′ : Sω (Σ) ֒→
Sω (Σ(e)). By Lemma 2.21, the following diagram commutes:
S+1 (Σ)

By cutting γ along e, we get an arc β ⊂ Σ(e) such that ie′ #e′′ (γ) = β++ + β−− .
Consider the algebra morphism ϕ : Sω (B) → Sω (Σ(e)) sending αεε′ to βεε′ .
One has:
jΣ(e) ◦ i|e′ #e′′ (γ) = jΣ(e) (β++ + β−− )
N

++ + α−− )

by Lemma 2.24

= ϕ(TN (α++ + α−− ))
= i|e′ #e′′ (TN (γ)).

by Proposition 2.26

Hence one has jΣ (γ) = TN (γ).
Step 4: adding a puncture. Let Σ′ = (Σ, P ∪ {p}) be a punctured surface
obtained from Σ = (Σ, P) by adding one puncture p ∈ ΣP . The inclusion map
ΣP∪{p} × (0, 1) ֒→ ΣP × (0, 1) induces a morphism of algebras π : Sω (Σ′ ) →
Sω (Σ) which is surjective.

Case 3: Let T0 ∈ F (∆) be a triangle such that, either p is in the interior
of T0 if p is an inner puncture, or p lies in the boundary of T0 if p is in the
boundary of ΣP . Consider the gluing maps i : Sω (Σ) ֒→ Sω (T0 ) ⊗ Sω (Σ \ T0 )
and i′ : Sω (Σ′ ) ֒→ Sω (T′0 ) ⊗ Sω (Σ \ T0 ). One has the following diagram:

Let us show that the inner middle square commutes. By Case 1 and 2, the big
outer square commutes. By definition of π, i and i′ , both the left-hand side and
the right-hand side squares commute. By Lemma 2.21, both the top and the
bottom squares commute. Because i and i′ are injective, these facts make the
inner middle square commutative.
(N )

Let αεε′ be the class of the stated tangle made by stacking N parallel copies

24

(N )

of αεε′ on top of the others. In particular αεε′ = (αεε′ )N if both endpoints of
α lye in different boundary arcs but the equality does not hold in general.
Lemma 2.29. If αεε′ ∈ Sω (Σ) is the class of a stated arc such that its endpoints
(N )
lie on the same boundary arcs, then jΣ (αεε′ ) = αεε′ .
Proof. Since the two endpoints of α lie on the same boundary component, we
can pick a puncture p on this boundary that lies between these two endpoints.
Denote by Σ′ = (Σ, P ∪ {p}) the punctured surface obtained by adding this
puncture. Denote by α′ ⊂ ΣP∪{p} the arc induced by α (so one has π(α′εε′ ) =
αεε′ ). By Lemma 2.24, one has jΣ′ (α′εε′ ) = (α′εε′ )N hence π ◦ jΣ′ (α′εε′ ) = αN
εε′ .
(N )
Proposition 2.28 implies that jΣ (αεε′ ) = αεε′ .
Lemma 2.30. If γ ∈ Sω (Σ) is the class of a closed curve, then jΣ (γ) = TN (γ).
Proof. If the closed curve can be chosen such that it intersects an edge of ∆
once and only once, then this is Lemma 2.27. Otherwise, we can refine the
triangulation by adding an inner puncture in order to have this property. Denote
by Σ′ the resulting punctured surface and let γ ′ ∈ S+1 (Σ′ ) be such that π(γ ′ ) =
γ. Lemma 2.27 implies that jΣ′ (γ ′ ) = TN (γ ′ ) and Proposition 2.28 implies that
jΣ (γ) = TN (γ).
Step 5: exceptional cases. We treat the four connected punctured surfaces
that do not have a non-degenerated topological triangulation.
The disc with only one puncture (on its boundary) and the sphere with only
one puncture have both trivial skein algebra, while the sphere with two punctures has a commutative skein algebra. Therefore, Theorem 1.2 holds trivially
for them.
Let D be a disc with one puncture on its boundary and one inner puncture
and let ∆ be its unique topological triangulation drawn in Figure 4. Let δ be
the unique non trivial arc of D and η be the peripheral curve encircling the inner
puncture.
Lemma 2.31. Theorem 1.2 holds for D.

Figure 4: The punctured surface D obtained from the triangle by gluing two
boundary arcs.
F
Proof. The punctured surface D is obtained from the disjoint union T B of a
triangle and a bigon, by gluing two pairs of boundary arcs a, a′ and b, b′ together
as in Figure 4. Write i := i|a#a′ ◦ i|b#b′ . Define jD : S+1 (D) ֒→ Z (Sω (D)) as
the unique algebra morphism making commuting the following diagram:

reader.

an associative product on A[[~]] such that if f = i fi ~i and g = i gi ~i are
elements of A[[h]], then:
f ⋆ g = f0 g0 mod ~,
where f0 g0 denotes the product of f0 and g0 in A. A star product induces a
Poisson structure on A by the formula:
f ⋆ g − g ⋆ f = ~{f, g} mod ~2 ,

(17)

for all f, g ∈ A. The algebra (A[[~]], ⋆) is called a deformation quantization
of the commutative Poisson algebra (A, {·, ·}). We refer to ([Kon03], [GRS05]
II.2) for detailed discussions. A morphism of star products between (A, ⋆A )
and (B, ⋆B ) is an algebra morphism ψ : A[[~]] → B[[~]] whose restriction to
A ⊂ A[[~]] induces a morphism φ : A → B. Note that such a φ is, in fact, a
morphism of Poisson algebras for the induced Poisson algebra structures. An
∼
=
isomorphism ψ : (A[[~]], ⋆1 ) −
→ (A[[~]], ⋆2 ) of star products is called a gauge
equivalence if ψ(f ) = f (mod ~). If two star products are gauge equivalent,
they induce the same Poisson bracket on A.
To end this preamble, let us mention that deformation quantization is wellbehaved relatively to the tensor product. Indeed, if A[[h]] and B[[h]] are deformation quantizations of A and B respectively, then A[[h]] ⊗ B[[h]] ∼
= (A ⊗ B)[[h]]
is a deformation quantization of A ⊗ B. Note also that the Poisson structure on
A ⊗ B given by (17) is
{f ⊗ g, f ′ ⊗ g ′ } = f f ′ ⊗ {g, g ′ } + {f, f ′ } ⊗ gg ′ ,
for f, f ′ ∈ A and g, g ′ ∈ B.

Formal definition

Let Σ be a punctured surface and o an orientation of its boundary arc. Denote
by S+1 (Σ) the stated skein algebra associated to the ring C with ω = +1 and
denote by Sω~ (Σ) the stated skein algebra associated to the ring C[[~]] with
ω~ := exp (−~/4). The convention is chosen so that q = exp(~). Recall the
basis B o from Definition 2.3. Since B o is independent of ω, one has a canonical
isomorphism of C[[~]]-modules
∼
=

ψ o : S+1 (Σ)[[~]] −
→ Sω~ (Σ).

(19)

Definition 2.32. Pulling-back the product of Sω~ (Σ) along ψ o gives a star
product ⋆~ on S+1 (Σ). We denote by {·, ·}s the resulting Poisson bracket on
S+1 (Σ) given by Equation (17).
Note that for any two orientations o1 and o2 of the boundary arcs of Σ, the
∼
=
automorphism (ψ o2 )−1 ◦ψ o1 : S+1 (Σ)[[~]] −
→ S+1 (Σ)[[~]] is a gauge equivalence,
s
hence the Poisson bracket {·, ·} does not depend on o.
By definition, (S+1 (Σ)[[~]], ⋆~ ) is a quantization deformation of the Poisson
algebra (S+1 (Σ), {·, ·}s ). Moreover, this structure of Poisson algebra is compatible with decompositions of surfaces. More precisely, one has the following.
Lemma 2.33. The gluing maps i|a#b : S+1 (Σ|a#b ) ֒→ S+1 (Σ), the maps
i∆ : S+1 (Σ) ֒→ ⊗T∈F (∆)S+1 (T) and the coproduct maps ∆L , ∆R are Poisson
morphisms.
Proof. This results from the fact that each of these morphisms arises from a
morphism of star products.
2.5.3

Explicit formula

This section is devoted to making explicit the Poisson bracket {·, ·}s on stated
diagrams. It will be expressed in terms of resolutions of stated diagrams, which
are defined at crossings and at points on the boundary arcs.
All along this section, Σ is a punctured surface.
Resolution at a crossing. Let (D, s) be a stated diagram and c a crossing
of D. Denote by D+ and D− the diagrams obtained from D by replacing the
crossing c by its positive and negative resolution respectively:
the crossing c

and its positive

and negative

resolution.

The resolution of (D, s) at the crossing c is defined by
Resc (D, s) := [D+ , s] − [D− , s] ∈ S+1 (Σ).
Resolution at boundary points. Let b1 , ..., bk be the boundary arcs of ΣP .
Definition 2.34. A height order on a stated diagram (D, s) of ΣP is a k–tuple
o = (o1 , ..., ok ) of bijections of sets oi : ∂bi D → {1 < ... < ni }.

27

Note that the product of symmetric groups Sn1 × · · · × Snk acts freely and
transitively on the set of height orders by left composition.
To a height order o on (D, s) corresponds a stated tangle with same height
order and which projects to (D, s). Therefore, one can consider the class of
(D, s, o) in Sω (Σ). If ω = +1, the class [D, s, o] ∈ S+1 (Σ) is independent of o,
and we denote it simply by [D, s].
Let us choose a boundary arc bi and suppose there are two points p1 and p2
o be
of ∂bi D such that oi (p1 ) = oi (p2 ) + 1 (i.e. p1 is the oi –successor of p2 ). Let e
the order on bi that is induced by the orientation of Σ. To alleviate notation,
we write p <eo q for e
o(p) < e
o(q).
Let τ ∈ Sni be the transposition that exchanges the oi order of p1 and p2 .
The resolution of (D, s) along τ , denoted by Resτ (D, s, o) ∈ S+1 (Σ), is given
by
1
[D, s],

where τ s is the state that differs from s only by exchanging the states of p1 and
p2 .

Let us extend the resolution to several points. For two transpositions σ1 and
σ2 of o–consecutive points, let
Resσ1 ◦σ2 (D, s, o) = Resσ1 (D, s, σ2 ◦ o) + Resσ2 (D, s, o).

(20)

Definition 2.35. For a permutation σ ∈ Sn1 ×· · ·×Snk , the resolution Resσ (D, s, o)
is defined via (20), by considering the decomposition of σ into transpositions of
o–consecutive points.
Remark 2.36. The resolution Resσ (D, s, o) is not invariant under isotopy of
(D, s). Also, one has Resid (D, s, o) = 0.
Lemma 2.37. In the skein algebra Sω~ (Σ), the following two statements holds.
1. Let D

and D

be two diagrams that differ from each other only by a

change of a crossing c. One has
[D , s, o] − [D , s, o] = ~ Resc (D , s) mod ~2 .
2. Let (D, s, o) be an o-ordered stated diagram. For π ∈ Sn1 × . . . × Snk one
has
[D, s, o] − [D, s, π ◦ o] = ~ Resπ (D, s, o) mod ~2 .
In the two statements, the resolutions Res are seen in Sω~ (Σ) via the isomorphism ψeo of (19).
28

Proof. The first equality is a consequence of the Kauffman bracket crossing
relation whereas the second is a consequence of the height exchange formulas.
Let us give a few details on the less straightforward case. Remark that (6) is

This provides the second formula for π a transposition of two consecutive points
p2 <eo p1 such that (s(p1 ), s(p2 )) = (+, −).

Proposition 2.38. Let o be an orientation of the boundary arcs of Σ and
(D1 , s2 , o1 ) and (D2 , s2 , o2 ) be two o-ordered stated diagrams such that D1 and
D2 intersect transversally in the interior of ΣP . Let (D1 D2 , s1 s2 ) be the stated
diagram obtained by staking D1 on top of D2 , o1 o2 the resulting height order
and π the permutation sending o2 o1 to o1 o2 . In S+1 (Σ), the Poisson bracket
from Definition 2.32 satisfies
X
s
{[D1 , s1 ], [D2 , s2 ]} =
Resc (D1 D2 , s1 s2 ) + Resπ (D1 D2 , s1 s2 , o1 o2 ).
c∈D1 ∩D2

Proof. In the algebra Sω~ (Σ), the products writes [D1 , s1 , o1 ] · [D2 , s2 , o2 ] =
[D1 D2 , s1 s2 , o1 o2 ] and [D2 , s2 , o2 ] · [D1 , s1 , o1 ] = [D2 D1 , s2 s1 , o2 o1 ]. We pass
from the diagram D1 D2 to D2 D1 by changing each crossing in the intersection
of the diagrams and changing the height order using π, so the formula is a
consequence of Lemma 2.37.
Remark 2.39. When Σ is a closed surface, we recover Goldman’s formula from
[Gol86]. When Σ has non trivial boundary and no inner punctures, the subalgebra of the stated skein algebra generated by tangles with states having only
value + is isomorphic to the Müller algebra defined in [M1̈6] (see [Le18, Section
6] ). The Poisson bracket restricts to the corresponding sub-algebra of S+1 (Σ)
and the resulting Poisson algebra is isomorphic to Yuasa’ s Poisson algebra in
[Yua15].
Example 2.40. The Poisson bracket {−, −}s on S+1 (B) is given by
{α++ , α+− }s = −α+− α++
{α−− , α+− }s = α+− α−−

{α++ , α−+ }s = −α−+ α++
{α−− , α−+ }s = α−+ α−−

{α+− , α−+ }s = 0

{α++ , α−− }s = −2α+− α−+

29

Example 2.41. For the triangle T, the Poisson structure is described by the
previous formulas in Example 2.40 by replacing α by each of the three arcs
α, β and γ, together with the following relations and their images through the
automorphisms τ and τ 2 :

Character varieties

3.1

Character varieties for open surfaces

In this subsection we briefly recall from [Kor19] the definition and main properties of character varieties for open surfaces.
The character variety of a closed punctured connected surface Σ is the algebraic quotient (familiar in geometric invariant theory):
XSL2 (Σ) := Hom (π1 (ΣP ), SL2 (C)) // SL2 (C)
under the action by conjugation of SL2 (C). Recall that by ”closed”, we mean
that Σ is closed though in this case ΣP is not closed when P 6= ∅. In [Gol86],
Goldman defined a Poisson structure on its algebra of regular functions. It
follows from [Bul97, PS00, Bar99, Tur91] that, given a spin structure S on Σ
with quadratic form ωS , there is a Poisson isomorphism
∼
=

φS : (S+1 (Σ), {·, ·}s ) −
→ (C[XSL2 (Σ)], {·, ·}).
For each non-contractible closed curve γ, it is given by φS (γ) = (−1)ωS ([γ])+1 τγ ,
where τγ is the regular function τγ ([ρ]) := Tr(ρ(γ)).
In [Kor19], the first author introduced a generalization of the character varieties to punctured surfaces which are not necessarily closed. We will also denote
it by XSL2 (Σ). Loosely speaking, it can be described as an algebraic quotient
of the following form
XSL2 (Σ) := Hom (Π1 (ΣP , ∂ΣP ), SL2 ) // G,
where Hom (Π1 (ΣP , ∂ΣP ), SL2 ) denotes the set of functors from the relative
fundamental groupoid to the one object category SL2 , and G is the group of
their natural transformations; see [Kor19] for details.
The character variety turns out to be an affine Poisson variety (whose Poisson
structure depends on a choice of orientation of the boundary arcs) and it is
proved in [Kor19, Theorem 1.1] that its algebra of regular functions C[XSL2 (Σ)]
is well-behaved under triangular decomposition: for a topological triangulation
∆, there are an injective morphism i∆ : C[XSL2 (Σ)] ֒→ ⊗T∈F (∆) C[XSL2 (T)] and
Hopf comodule maps ∆L and ∆R such that the following sequence is exact:
i∆

0 → C[XSL2 (Σ)] −→ ⊗T∈F (∆) C[XSL2 (T)]



∆L −σ◦∆R
−−−−−−−→ ⊗e∈E̊(∆) C[SL2 ] ⊗ ⊗T∈F (∆) C[XSL2 (T)] .
30

In the present paper, we proceed by describing the character variety for the
bigone and the triangle, together with the Hopf comodule maps ∆L and ∆R .
Then, in virtue of the above property, we define the character variety for any
punctured surface as the kernel of ∆L − σ ◦ ∆R .
First, recall that sl2 denotes the Lie algebra of the 2 × 2
It has a basis formed by

In order to define the Poisson structure, we will need the following.
Definition 3.1. The classical r-matrices r± ∈ sl2⊗2 are the bi-vectors r+ :=
1
−
:= 12 H ⊗ H + 2F ⊗ E. Their symmetric part
2 H ⊗ H + 2E ⊗ F and r
1
τ = 2 H ⊗H +E ⊗F +F ⊗E is the invariant bi-vector associated to the (suitably
normalised) Killing form and we denote by r+ := E ⊗ F − F ⊗ E =: −r− their
skew-symmetric part.
The classical r-matrices satisfy the classical Yang-Baxter equation (see [Dri83],
[CP95, Section 2.1] for details).
Notations 3.2. Given a a boundary arc of Σ, we write o(a) = + if the oorientation of a coincides with the orientation induced by the orientation of ΣP
and write o(a) = − if the orientation are opposite.
3.1.1

The bigon

Consider the bigon B and write o(bL ) = ε1 and o(bR ) = ε2 .
Definition 3.3. The character
 variety of the bigon is XSL2 (B) := SL2 (C).
x++ x+−
Denote by N =

x−+ x−−
The Poisson bracket associated to o is defined by:
{N ⊗ N }ε1 ,ε2 := r ε1 (N ⊗ N ) + (N ⊗ N )r ε2 .
Here we used the classical notation {N ⊗ N } to denote the matrix defined
by {N ⊗ N }εε′ µµ′ = {xεε′ , xµµ′ }.
Denote the Poisson variety (C[SL2 ], {·, ·}ε1 ,ε2 ) by C[SL2 ]ε1 ,ε2 . Remark that
{·, ·}ε1 ,ε2 = −{·, ·}−ε1 ,−ε2 . By [Kor19, Lemma 4.1], the coproduct ∆ : C[SL2 ]ε1 ,ε2 →
C[SL2 ]ε1 ,ε ⊗ C[SL2 ]−ε,ε2 and the antipode S : C[SL2 ]ε1 ,ε2 → C[SL2 ]−ε1 ,−ε2 are
Poisson morphisms. In particular, the Poisson brackets {·, ·}−,+ and {·, ·}+,−
are the only ones which endow SL2 (C) with a Poisson-Lie structure.
3.1.2

The triangle

Consider the triangle T and fix an orientation o of each of its three boundary
arcs a, b and c. We will use the notation s(α) = t(β) := c, s(γ) = t(α) := b and
s(β) = t(γ) := a. Here, for instance, we think of α as an oriented path joining
a point in c = s(α) (source) to a point in b = t(α) (target).

31

{Nγ ⊗ S(Nβ )}o = (Nγ ⊗ S(Nβ ))ro(a)
{Nβ ⊗ S(Nα )}o = (Nβ ⊗ S(Nα ))ro(c)
Given a boundary arc d ∈ {a, b, c}, we define a left Hopf-comodule ∆L

3.1.3

The general case

Let Σ be a punctured surface, ∆ a topological triangulation of Σ, and o∆ an
orientation of each edge of ∆. For a face T ∈ F (∆), let oT be the orientation
of its boundary arcs given by o∆ . Equip the algebra ⊗T∈F (∆)C[XSL2 (T)]oT with
˚
the Poisson bracket defined in Definition
F 3.4 . Each inner edge e ∈ E(∆) lifts to
two oriented boundary arcs in Σ∆ := T∈F (∆) T. We denote by eL the lift of e
whose orientation coincides with the induced orientation of Σ∆ and by eR the
R
other lift. The comodule maps ∆L
eL and ∆eR induce the comodule maps:



∆L : ⊗T∈F (∆) C[XSL2 (T)]oT → ⊗e∈E̊(∆) C[SL2 ]−,+ ⊗ ⊗T∈F (∆)C[XSL2 (T)]oT ;

∆R : ⊗T∈F (∆)C[XSL2 (T)]oT → ⊗T∈F (∆) C[XSL2 (T)]oT ⊗ ⊗e∈E̊(∆) C[SL2 ]−,+ .
32

Definition 3.5. The character variety XSL2 (Σ) is the affine variety whose algebra of regular functions is the kernel of ∆L − σ ◦ ∆R .
Since the morphisms ∆L and ∆R are Poisson morphisms, the algebra C[XSL2 (Σ)]
is a sub-Poisson algebra of ⊗T∈F (∆)C[XSL2 (T)]oT . Moreover, this algebra is
finitely generated and reduced (see [Kor19, Theorem 1.1]). As an affine variety,
the character variety does not depend on o∆ . Moreover it follows from [Kor19,
Theorem 1.4] that the Poisson structure does not depend on the orientation of
the inner edges, hence only depends on the orientation o of the boundary arcs.
We denote by {., .}o the Poisson bracket on C[XSL2 (Σ)]. By [Kor19, Proposition
2.11], the character variety does not depend, up to canonical isomorphism, on
the triangulation. Moreover when Σ is closed, the Poisson variety XSL2 (Σ) is
canonically isomorphic to the ”classical” (Culler-Shalen) character variety with
its Goldman Poisson structure ([Kor19, Theorem 1.1]).

Lemma 3.6. For ε1 , ε2 ∈ {−, +}, there is a Poisson isomorphism Ψε1 ,ε2 :

For (ε1 , ε2 ) = (−, +), this follows from a direct comparison of Definition 3.3 and
Example 2.40. Indeed, one has:

that Ψo is Poisson by showing that the isomorphism Ψo ◦ (Ψo )−1 is Poisson.

The general case: proof of Theorem 1.3

Consider a topological triangulation ∆ of a punctured surface Σ, together with
a choice o∆ of orientation of its edges. Consider the following commutative
diagram:

In this diagram, both lines are exact and all morphisms are Poisson by Lemma

3.3

Relative spin structures and explicit formulas

The goal of this subsection is to give an explicit formula for the morphism
Ψ(∆,o∆ ) , when evaluated on the generators of S+1 (Σ). A key point is to have
a global method to compute some signs that depend on the combinatorial data
(∆, o∆ ). We provide such a method by introducing the notion of relative spin
structure, which gives a geometric interpretation these signs. We end the section
by relating the Ψ(∆,o∆ ) with the morphism of [CL19, Theorem 8.12].
3.3.1

Relative spin structures

Since the classical identifications between skein algebras of closed punctured
surfaces and character varieties are indexed by spin structures, it is natural
to expect that the combinatorial data (∆, o∆ ) indexing the isomorphism of
Theorem 1.3 encode a generalization of the notion of spin structures which
would have a good behavior for the operation of gluing boundary arcs together.
Before defining this notion, we introduce some notations.
Notations 3.8.
1. For a topological space X, we let Π1 (X) denote its fundamental groupoid: objects are the points in X and morphisms are homotopy classes of oriented paths. We let s and t denote the source and
target maps, which for a morphism α : v1 → v2 are given by s(α) = v1
and t(α) = v2 . By convention, we compose the morphisms from left to
right, i.e. if α1 : v1 → v2 and α2 : v2 → v3 are two paths, their composition is a path α1 α2 : v1 → v3 . For S ⊂ X, we denote by Π1 (X, S) the
full subcategory of Π1 (X) whose objects are points in S. For a group G,
the set Hom(Π1 (X, S), G) denotes the set of functors ρ : Π1 (X, S) → G,

35

where G is seen as a category with one element. With our conventions, if
t(α1 ) = s(α2 ), one has ρ(α1 α2 ) = ρ(α1 )ρ(α2 ).
2. In this subsection, Σ = (Σ, P) will denote a triangulable punctured surface, o an orientation of its boundary arcs and (∆, o∆ ) a combinatorial
data and we equip ΣP with a Riemannian structure compatible with the
orientation. For each boundary arc a, we fix a point va ∈ a. If ∂Σ 6= ∅,
we write V := {va }a where a runs through the set of boundary arcs. If Σ
is closed, we fix an arbitrarily point va in each connected component a of
ΣP and write V := {va }a .
3. Let π : U ΣP → ΣP denote the unitary tangent bundle. For ~v = (v, u) ∈
U ΣP , we denote by −~v = (v, −u) the vector with opposite orientation.
1/2
Denote by θ~v : ~v → −~v the class in Π1 (U ΣP ) of a path making a halftwist in the fiber over π(~v ) in the direction given by the orientation and
1/2 1/2
write θ~v := θ~v θ−~v . For simplicity, for a path α : ~v1 → ~v2 , we will write
1/2

1/2

θ1/2 α and αθ1/2 instead of θ−~v1 α and αθ~v2 with no confusion possible.
When ∂Σ 6= ∅, for each boundary arc a, we denote by ~va ∈ U ΣP the lift of
va pointing in the direction of o. When Σ is closed, we fix an arbitrarily
b + := {~va }a and V
b := {~va , −~va }a .
lift ~va of each va . We write V

Definition 3.9. A relative spin structure on Σ is a functor
b + ), Z/2Z) such that W (θ~v ) = 1 for all ~v ∈ V
b + . We denote
W ∈ Hom(Π1 (U ΣP , V
by Spin(Σ) the set of relative spin structures on Σ.

Remark 3.10. When Σ is closed and connected, an element W ∈ Spin(Σ)
is a group morphism W : π1 (U ΣP , ~v0+ ) → Z/2Z such that W (θ~v+ ) = 1.
0
Since Z/2Z is abelian, such a morphism is equivalent to a group morphism
W : H1 (U ΣP , Z/2Z) → Z/2Z satisfying W ([θ]) = 1. Such a morphism W dee of U ΣP such that the covering on each fiber is
fines a regular double covering U
non trivial. Since Spin(2) is the only non-trivial double covering of SO(2), the
e is the total space of a Spin(2) fiber bundle over ΣP lifting the bundle
space U
of orthogonal frames induced by the metric, hence it defines a spin structure.
There is actually a 1 to 1 correspondence between isomorphism classes of spin
structures and such morphism W (see [Mil63] for details). Therefore a relative spin structure is the same than a ”standard” spin structure in the closed
case. When the surface has non empty boundary, an element W ∈ Spin(Σ)
still induces a group morphism W thus a spin structure. However the functor
W contains more information than W which permits to ”glue” relative spin
structures together.
Let a and b be two distinct boundary arcs of Σ and denote by p : ΣP →
ΣP |a#b the projection. We assume that p is an isometry, that the orientations
by o of a and b coincide when gluing the arcs and that p(va ) = p(vb ) =: vc . The
projection induces a lift ~vc ∈ U ΣP |a#b of vc and a functor
b + ) → Π1 (U ΣP |a#b , V
b a#b ∪ {~vc }).
p∗ : Π1 (U ΣP , V
+

Lemma 3.11. For W ∈ Spin(Σ), there exists a unique W|a#b ∈ Spin(Σ|a#b )
b + ).
such that W|a#b (p∗ (α)) = W (α) for all α ∈ Π1 (U ΣP , V
36

Proof. This follows from the fact that the image of p∗ generates the groupoid
b a#b ∪ {~vc }) in the sense that any path α ∈ Π1 (U ΣP |a#b , V
b a#b ∪
Π1 (U ΣP |a#b , V
+
+
{~vc }) can be written as a composition α = p∗ (α1 ) . . . p∗ (αn ) for some αi ∈
b + ). Hence for W ∈ Spin(Σ), there exists an unique functor W
f :
Π1 (U ΣP , V
a#b
b
f (π∗ (α)) = W (α) for all α ∈
Π1 (U ΣP |a#b , V
∪ {~vc }) → Z/2Z such that W
+
b
f to the full subcategory
Π1 (U ΣP , V+ ), and W|a#b has to be the restriction of W
a#b
b
Π1 (U ΣP |a#b , V
+ ).
Note that the map ra#b : Spin(Σ) → Spin(Σ|a#b ) sending W to W|a#b is
surjective but not injective. Note also that if a, b, c, d are four distinct boundary
arcs, one obviously has ra#b ◦ rc#d = rc#d ◦ ra#b . In particular, once some
combinatorial data (∆, o∆ ) of Σ are fixed, any relative spin structure on Σ
can be obtained by gluing some relative spin structure on each face of the
triangulation.
3.3.2

Lifts of embedded curves and the function w

Let us call embedded arc a smooth embedding α : [0, 1] → ΣP such that
α(0), α(1) ∈ ∂ΣP . To any embedded arc a simple closed curve, we associate
two lifts in U ΣP as follows.
For α an embedded arc oriented from the boundary arc a to the boundary arc
b, isotope α (in the class of embedded arc) such that α(0) = va , (1) = vb , α′ (0)
and α′ (1) are tangent to a and b and such that α′ (0) points in the direction
of a opposite to the orientation induced by the orientation of ΣP and such
that α′ (1) points in the direction of b induced by the orientation of ΣP . The
b of the continuous map
positive
b+ ∈ Π1 (U ΣP , V)
 lift of α isthe homotopy class α
′

α (t)
t → α(t), kα
′ (t)k .
For v a point in a boundary arc a, we write o(v) = 0 if the orientation
of a agrees with the induced orientation of ΣP and o(v) = 1 else. The o-lift
b + ) is defined by the formula
α
bo ∈ Π1 (U ΣP , V

γ

b+ = (θ1/2 )1−o(s(α)) α

(22)

Let γ be a smooth embedded curve and
bv+ and
 v ∈ V ′and define two lifts γ
β (t)
as the homotopy class of a map t → β(t), kβ ′ (t)k where β is a smooth

immersion β : [0, 1] → ΣP isotope to γ such that β(0) = v = β(1) and β ′ (0)
points in the direction induced by the orientation of the surface for γ
bv+ and
o
points in the direction of o for γ
bv . In the case where Σ is closed and γ is in a
connected component b, we impose that b
γv+ = b
γvo is defined from an immersion
′
β such that (β(0), β (0)) = vb .
Notations 3.12. For W ∈ Spin(Σ) and α an embedded arc, we write w(α) :=
W (b
αo ) ∈ Z/2Z. For γ a closed curve we write w(γ) := W (b
γvo ).

Remark 3.13. The value w(γ) associated to a closed curve is obviously independent on the choice of the point v. Moreover, as noted in Remark 3.10, the
value W (b
γ ) only depends on the homology class [b
γ o ] ∈ H1 (U ΣP ; Z/2Z) and is
closely related to the Johnson quadratic form as follows. Let {γi }i=1,...,n be a
collection of simple closed curves. Johnson proved in [Joh80, Theorem 1.A] that

37

P
the class y := ni=1
γio ] + n[θ] ∈ H1 (U ΣP ; Z/2Z) only depends on the homolP[b
n
ogy class of x := i=1 [γi ] ∈ H1 (ΣP ; Z/2Z) hence that the assignation x 7→ y
defines a map (not a morphism) H1 (ΣP ; Z/2Z) → H1 (U ΣP ; Z/2Z). Moreover,
for a (relative) spin structure W , Johnson provedP
in [Joh80, Theorem
Pn 1.B] that
n
the map ω : H1 (ΣP ; Z/2Z) → Z/2Z defined by ω( i=1 [γi ]) := n + i=1 w([γi ])
(mod 2) satisfies the relation
ω([α + β]) = ω([α]) + ω([β]) + h[α], [β]i ,
hence that ω is a quadratic form for (H1 (ΣP ; Z/2Z), h·, ·i), where h·, ·i represents
the intersection form. Hence the values w(γ) in Definition 3.12 are related to the
Johnson quadratic form of the underlying spin structure by ω([γ]) = w(γ) + 1
(mod 2).
3.3.3

Relative spin structures associated to combinatorial data

In order to a assign a relative spin structure to some combinatorial data (∆, o∆ )
in a canonical way, we need to assign to each triangle T, equipped with an
orientation oT of its boundary arcs, a canonical relative spin structure and then
gluing the triangles along their faces. Let α, β, γ be the three paths in Figure
1 which generate the groupoid Π1 (T, V) with relation γβα = 1. Note that
boT = θ−2 . Hence a relative
for any choice of oT , one has the relation γ
boT βboT α
spin structure W on T is described by three element W (b
αoT ), W (βboT ), W (b
γ oT ) ∈
oT
oT
oT
b
Z/2Z such that W (b
α ) + W (β ) + W (b
γ ) = 0. Therefore there exist four
different relative spin structures on T.

Definition 3.14. The distinguished relative spin structure on T is the relative spin structure W such that W (b
αoT ) = W (βboT ) = W (b
γ oT ) = 0. For Σ
a punctured surface with combinatorial data (∆, o∆ ), we associate a relative
spin structure W (∆,o∆ ) ∈ Spin(Σ) by gluing together the distinguished spin
structures on the faces of the triangulation.

Note that the distinguished relative spin structure W on T satisfies w(α) =
w(β) = w(γ) = 0 and w(α−1 ) = w(β −1 ) = w(γ −1 ) = 1.
Remark 3.15. Since we associate to each face a specific (named distinguished)
relative spin structure, there is no reason to believe that every spin structures on
ΣP can be associated to some combinatorial data. Moreover we will not investigate under which condition two combinatorial data induce the same relative
spin structure. In [NR15], Novak and Runkel showed that any spin structure
on a surface can be encoded by the combinatorial data consisting in a triangulation (with no degenerate face), an orientation of the edges and a choice of
distinguished vertex for each face. Moreover they proved that two such combinatorial data induce the same spin structure if and only if they can be related
by a sequence of elementary moves. It would be interesting to compare their
approach to Definition 3.14.
We now state an explicit formula for the values w(α) associated to a relative
spin structure W (∆,o∆ ) . For each edge e ∈ E(∆), fix a point ve ∈ e and let V∆ =
{ve }e∈E(∆) . When ∂Σ 6= ∅, we assume that V∆ ∩∂ΣP = V. When Σ is closed, we
assume that V ⊂ V∆ . Let ~ve ∈ U ΣP be the lift of ve oriented in the direction

Let α be either an embedded arc or a closed curve and choose a decomposition
α = α1 . . . αn , αi ∈ G∆ ,
(23)

such that either αi and αi+1 lies in different faces Ti 6= Ti+1 of ∆, or Ti = Ti+1
is a degenerate triangle, with two boundary arcs glued together to give an arc
c in ΣP , and αi αi+1 crosses c = t(αi ) = s(αi+1 ) transversally. In the above
statement, the indexes i are taken in Z/nZ when α is a closed curve. Note that
such a decomposition is obtained by isotoping α transversally with minimal
intersection to the edges of the triangulation, and then cutting α along the
edges.
Lemma 3.16. The function w associated to the relative spin structure W (∆,o∆ )
is characterized by the formula
 Pn

Pni=1 w(αi ) + Pni=1 oTi (t(αi )) (mod 2) , if α is an embedded arc;
w(α) =

i=1 oTi (t(αi )) (mod 2)
Proof. First note that for the positive lifts, one has the equality
α

This equality follows from the fact that the embedded curve chosen to represent

Equation (22) that αbi + = (θ1/2 )1−o(s(αi )) α
boi (θ1/2 )o(t(αi )) and note that, since
we assume that the faces Ti and Ti+1 are distinct, one has
(1 − oTi (t(αi ))) + oTi+1 (s(αi+1 )) = 2oTi+1 (s(αi )),

(where indexes are understood modulo n when α is a closed curve). When α is
an arc, we thus obtain the equality

Explicit formulas for the isomorphism

In order to describe the isomorphism Ψ(∆,o∆) of Theorem 1.3 more explicitly,
let us recall from [Kor19] a more explicit alternative definition of the character
variety. When Σ is connected, the character variety XSL2 (Σ) is canonically
isomorphic to the following affine variety:

Hom(Π1 (ΣP , V), SL2 (C))
, when ∂Σ 6= ∅;
′
XSL2 (Σ) :=
Hom(Π1 (ΣP , V), SL2 (C)) // SL2 (C) , when Σ is closed and connected.
When Σ is closed and connected, the group SL2 (C) acts on the variety Hom(Π1 (ΣP , V), SL2 (C))
= Hom(π1 (ΣP , v0 ), SL2 (C)) by conjugacy and we take the GIT quotient. Let
us sketch the equivalence with Definition 3.5, we refer to [Kor19] for more details and proofs. First in the case of the triangle T, the equivalence XSL2 (T) ∼
=
XSL2 (T)′ follows immediately from the definitions. Since V ⊂ V∆ , the groupoid
Π1 (ΣP , V) is a full subcategory of Π1 (ΣP , V∆ ). Hence the inclusion of groupoids
induces, by precompositon, a surjective map Hom(Π1 (ΣP , V∆ ), SL2 (C)) →
Hom(Π1 (ΣP , V∂ ), SL2 (C)), which after eventual composition with the GIT
projection map in the closed case, defines an algebraic morphism
p : Hom(Π1 (ΣP , V∆ ), SL2 (C)) → XSL2 (Σ)′ .
Since the groupoid Π1 (ΣP , V∆ ) is generated by the set G∆ with relations δδ −1 =
1, for δ ∈ G∆ and γT βT γT = 1 for T ∈ F (∆), one has a canonical isomorphism
C[Hom(Π1 (ΣP , V∆ ), SL2 (C))] ∼
= ⊗T∈F (∆)C[XSL2 (T)]. The injective map
p∗

i : C[XSL2 (Σ)′ ] −→ C[Hom(Π1 (ΣP , V∆ ), SL2 (C))] ∼
= ⊗T∈F (∆)C[XSL2 (T)], (24)
is a kernel for the morphisms ∆L −σ◦∆R appearing in Definition 3.5 (see [Kor19]
for a proof), hence one has a canonical isomorphism XSL2 (Σ)′ ∼
= XSL2 (Σ) and
we now identify the two varieties.
For α an embedded arc, seen as a path in the fundamental groupoid, and
ε, ε′ = ±, the regular function Fαεε′ ∈C[XSL2 (Σ)] is defined
 on a functor
Fα++ (ρ) Fα+− (ρ)
. For γ a closed
ρ ∈ Hom(Π1 (ΣP , V), SL2 (C)) by ρ(α) =
Fα−+ (ρ) Fα−− (ρ)
curve, represented by an arbitrary path γv ∈ Π1 (ΣP , V), one defines Fγ ∈
C[XSL2 (Σ)] by Fγ ([ρ]) := Tr(ρ(γv )). Since the trace is invariant by conjugacy,
the value Tr(ρ(γv )) does not depend on the choice of base point v nor on the
representative ρ in the class [ρ]. The functions
Fαεε′ andFγ generate the algebra

Fα++ Fα+−
C[XSL2 (Σ)]. For α an arc, we set Nα :=
the 2 × 2 matrix with

Theorem 3.17. For each embedded arc α, one has
Ψ(∆,o∆ ) (Mα ) = (−1)w(α) (C −1 )1−o(α(0)) Nα (C −1 )o(α(1)) .

(25)

For each closed curve γ, one has
Ψ(∆,o∆ ) (γ) = (−1)w(γ) Fγ .

(26)

Remark 3.18. When Σ is closed, recall from Remarks 3.10, 3.13 that W (∆,o∆ )
is a standard spin structure associated to a quadratic form ω such that w(γ) =
ω([γ]) + 1. Hence in the closed case, the isomorphism Ψ(∆,o∆ ) coincides with
the ”standard” isomorphisms described at the beginning of Section 3.1.
Recall that Ψ(∆,o∆) is defined by the following diagram
S+1 (Σ)

For x ∈ S+1 (T), we still denote by x the element in ⊗T S+1 (T) having 1 in
the factors S+1 (T′ ) for T′ 6= T and x in the factor S+1 (T). Hence for δ ∈ G∆
a path in T, the matrix Mδ is considered as a 2 × 2 matrix with coefficients
in ⊗T S+1 (T). Similarly, the matrix Nδ is considered as a 2 × 2 matrix with
coefficients in ⊗T C[XSL2 (T)].
Proof. We first show that if Equation (25) holds for an arc α, then it holds for
α−1 . This fact follows from the facts that w(α−1 ) = w(α) + 1, from the equalities (C −1 )⊺ = C and A−1 = −C −1 A⊺ C −1 for A ∈ SL2 (C) and the following
computation:
Ψ(Mα−1 )

Next let us prove the theorem for the triangle T. The fact that Equation (25)
holds for the arcs αT , βT and γT is an immediate consequence of the definition of
ΨoT in Lemma 3.7 and from the definition of the canonical spin structure in T.
−1
−1
By the preceding arguments, Equation (25) also holds for the arcs α−1
T , βT , γT
and the theorem is proved for T.
In the general case, consider an arc α and choose a decomposition
α = α1 . . . , αn

, αi ∈ G∆

as before. By the gluing formula for stated skein algebras ([Le18, Theorem 3.1]),
one has i∆ (Mα ) = Mα1 . . . Mαn . By definition of the morphism i in Equation
(24), one has i∆ (Nα ) = Nα1 . . . Nαn . By the preceding case of the triangle, one
has
(⊗T ΨoT )(Mαi ) = (−1)w(αi ) (C −1 )1−oTi (s(αi )) Nαi (C −1 )oTi (t(α) .
Hence by Lemma 3.16 one has


(⊗T ΨoT ) ◦ i∆ (Mα ) = i∆ (−1)w(α) (C −1 )1−o(s(α)) Nα (C −1 )o(t(α)) ,
41

and Equation (25) follows from the commutativity of the diagram (27). The
proof for a closed curved is done similarly by taking the trace of the above

Comparison with Costantino-Lê’s isomorphism

Let Σ be a connected punctured surface with non-trivial boundary. Costantino
and Lê defined in [CL19] the twisted character variety χ(Σ) as the space of funcb SL2 (C)) such that ρb(θ1/2 ) = C −1 for any ~v ∈ V.
b Let
tors ρb ∈ Hom(Π1 (U ΣP , V),
~
v
S denote the maximal spectrum of S+1 (Σ). For χ ∈ S , seen
 as a character χ:
χ(α++ ) χ(α+− )
S+1 (Σ) → C∗ , and for α an oriented arc, write χ(α) :=
.
χ(α+− ) χ(α−− )
∼
=

In [CL19, Theorem 8.12], the authors defined an affine isomorphism Θ : S −
→
χ(Σ) sending a character χ to a functor ρb such that χ(α) = ρb(b
α+ ) for any embedded (even immersed) arc and such that χ(γ) = Tr(b
ρ(b
γ + )) for any closed curve.
(∆,o∆ )
Composing Θ with the isomorphism induced by Ψ
, one obtains an isomorphism XSL2 (Σ) ∼
= χ(Σ). By Theorem 3.17, this isomorphism sends a functor

Classical Shadows

Suppose that ω ∈ C is a root of unity of odd order N > 1. A central representation of the stated skein algebra is a finite dimensional representation
r : Sω (Σ) → End(V ) which sends each element of the image of the morphism j of Theorem 1.2 to scalar operators. Fix a topological triangulation
∆ of Σ and an orientation o∆ of its edges. Then r induces a character on
Ψ(∆,o∆ )

S+1 (Σ) −−−∼−−→ C[XSL2 (Σ)] and this character induces a point in the character
=

variety XSL2 (Σ) that we call the classical shadow of r, as in [BW16] in the closed
case. By definition, the classical shadow only depends on the isomorphism class
of r.
To motivate the results of this paper, we list three families of central representations. First irreducible representations are obviously central. Then choose
for each triangle T ∈ F (∆) an irreducible representation rT : Sω (T) → End(VT )
and consider the composition:
i∆

⊗ rT

r : Sω (Σ) −→ ⊗T∈F (∆)Sω (T) −−T−→ End(⊗T VT ).
Such a representation is central and were called local representations in
[BBL07]. Eventually, consider the balanced Chekhov-Fock algebra Zω (Σ, ∆)
defined in [BW11] after the original construction of [CF99]. Given a closed
punctured surface whose set of punctures in non-empty, the authors of [BW11]
defined an algebra morphism (the quantum trace) Tr : Sω (Σ) → Zω (Σ, ∆) that
was extended to open punctured surface in [Le18]. One motivation is the fact
that the representation theory of the balanced Chekhov-Fock algebra is easier to
study than the one of the skein algebras (see [BL07, BW17]). For an irreducible
representation π : Zω (Σ, ∆) → End V of the balanced Chekhov-Fock algebra,

42

we call quantum Teichmüller representation, the composition:
Tr

π

r : Sω (Σ) −→ Zω (Σ, ∆) −
→ End(V ).
Quantum Teichmüller representations are central.

Proof of Proposition 2.26 and application
Proof of Proposition 2.26

We divide the proof of Proposition 2.26 in five lemmas.
Along this section, we write A := ω −2 . Denote by A = ([0, 1]×S 1 , {p, p′ }) the
annulus with punctures p = {0}×{1} and p′ = {1}×{1} in each of its boundary
components and denote by b = {0}×S 1 \{p} and b′ = {1}×S 1 \{p′ } its boundary
arcs. Let γ ⊂ [0, 1] × S 1 be the curve { 21 } × S 1 . Let δ (n) , η (n) ⊂ [0, 1] × S 1 be the
arcs with endpoints b and b′ such that δ (n) spirals n times in the counterclockwise
direction and η (n) spirals n times in the clockwise direction. The arcs are drawn
in Figure 5. By convention, δ (0) and η (0) represent the empty diagram. Denote
by β the arc [0, 1] × {−1}. By convention, if α is one of the arcs β, δ (n) , η (n) , we
denote by αεε′ ∈ Sω (A) the class of the corresponding stated tangle with sign
ε in b and ε′ in b′ . The following lemma and its proof are quite similar, though
stated in a different skein algebra, to [Le15, Proposition 2.2].

Figure 5: The annulus A, the square Q and some arcs and curves.
Lemma A.1. In Sω (A) the elements TN (γ) and βεε′ commute.
Proof. First note that a direct application of the Kauffman bracket skein rela(n+1)

tions implies that γ · δεε′ = Aδεε′ + A−1 δεε′ and γ · ηεε′ = Aηεε′ + A−1 ηεε′
when n ≥ 1. Next we show by induction on n ≥ 0 that Tn (γ) · βεε′ =
(n)
(n)
An δεε′ + A−n ηεε′ . The statements is an immediate consequence of the definitions when n = 0 and a direct application of the Kauffman bracket relations
when n = 1. Suppose that the results holds for n and n + 1. Then:
Tn+2 (γ)βεε′

=

γ · Tn+1 (γ) · βεε′ − Tn (γ) · βεε′

and the statement follows by induction. Similarly we show that βεε′ · Tn (γ) =
(n)
A−n δεε′ + An η (n) . Hence we have:

TN (γ) · βεε′ − βεε′ · TN (γ) = (AN − A−N )(δεε′ − ηεε′ ) = 0.

Denote by Q the square, i.e. a disc with four punctures on its boundary.
Let b1 , . . . , b4 be its four boundary arcs labelled in the counter-clockwise order.
When gluing b1 along b3 , we obtain the annulus with b2 sent to b and b4 sent
to b′ . We denote by i|b1 #b3 : Sω (A) ֒→ Sω (Q) the gluing morphism. Let
α, β, δ (n) , η (n) ⊂ Q be the arcs which are sent to γ, β, δ (n) and η (n) respectively as
in Figure 5. Fix an arbitrary orientation o of the boundary arcs of Q and consider
≥0
the filtration (Fm )m≥0 associated to
. S = {b2 , b4 }. Write d : Sω (Q) → Z the
corresponding map and Gm := Fm F
the corresponding graduation.

Lemma A.2. The following holds:

N
lt (α++ + α−− )N = lt (TN (α++ + α−− )) = αN
++ + α−− .

Proof. First note that in G4 , we have α−− α++ = q 2 α++ α−−
 . So it follows
N
from Lemma 2.15 that in G2N , we have lt (α++ + α−− )N = αN
++ + α−− .
N
Since TN (X) − X is a polynomial of degree strictly smaller that N , the degree of TN ((α++ + α−− ) − (α++ + α−−)) is strictly smaller than 2N , thus
lt (TN (α++ + α−− )) = lt (α++ + α−− )N .

Let α(n) be the diagram made of n parallel copies of α. Using the identifi(n)
(n)
cations ∂δ (n) = ∂η (n) = ∂α(n) ∪ ∂β, we denote by δ(s,ε,ε′ ) , η(s,ε,ε′ ) ∈ Sω (Q) the

classes of the tangles δ (n) and η (n) with states given by a state s of α(n) and a
state (ε, ε′ ) of β.
Lemma A.3. For n ≥ 0 and s a state of α(n) , we have:
h



(n)
(n)
lt [α(n) , s], βεε′ = (An − A−n ) δ(s,ε,ε′ ) − η(s,ε,ε′ ) ,
where we used the notation [x, y] = xy − yx.

Proof. The diagram obtained by stacking α(n) on top of β has n crossings and
thus 2n resolutions using the Kauffman bracket relation. We remark that the
(n)
resolution obtained by replacing each crossing by is An δ(s,ε,ε′ ) while the res(n)

is A−n η(s,ε,ε′ ) . These two
olution obtained by replacing each crossing by
resolutions have degree 2n and all the others resolutions have degrees strictly

(n)
(n)
smaller, thus lt [α(n) , s] · βεε′ = An δ(s,ε,ε′ ) + A−n η(s,ε,ε′ ) . We prove similarly

(n)
(n)
that lt βεε′ · [α(n) , s] = A−n δ(s,ε,ε′ ) + An η(s,ε,ε′ ) and conclude by taking the
difference.
Lemma A.4. If x ∈ Sω (Q) is a polynomial in Sω (Q) in the elements αεε′ such
that d(x) < 2N and such that x commutes with all elements βµ,µ′ , then x is a
constant.
P
ni
Proof. Let x =
i∈I xi [α , si ] be the decomposition in the basis of stated
tangles with increasing states si and denote by 2n < 2N its degree. Suppose
by contradiction
that n 6= 0. Let J = {j ∈ I, such that ni = n} ⊂ I so we have
P
lt(x) = j∈J xj [αn , sj ]. The hypothesis on x and Lemma A.3 imply that:
0 = lt ([x, βεε′ ]) =

X

xj (An − A−n )(δ(sj ,ε,ε′ ) − η(s,ε,ε′ ) ).

(n)

Since the elements δ(sj ,ε,ε′ ) and η(sj ,ε,ε′ ) are linearly independent for n ≥ 1,
we conclude that xj (An − A−n ) = 0 for all j ∈ J. Since 0 < n < N , we obtain
that xj = 0 for all j ∈ J thus lt(x) = 0. This gives the contradiction.
The set B ′ := {αa−+ αb++ αc+− , a, b, c ≥ 0} ∪ {αa−+ αb−− αc+− , a, b, c ≥ 0} forms
a basis of the algebra Sω (B). This fact is Exercise 7 in Chapter IV Section 6
of [Kas95], and is proved as follows. Choose an orientation o of the boundary
arcs of B such that bL and bR points towards different punctures and consider
the filtration associated to S = {bL , bR }. For each element of the basis B o ,
there exists exactly one element of B ′ which has the same leading term. For
x ∈ Sω (B), denote by c(x) ∈ R the coefficient of 1 in the decomposition of the
basis B ′ .
Lemma A.5. One has the equality: c(TN (α++ + α−− )) = 0.
Proof. Let n ≥ 1 be an odd integer and let us show that c ((α++ + α−− )n ) = 0.
The proof will then follow from the fact that TN (X) is an odd polynomial, thus is
a linear combination of such elements, and the fact that c is linear. The product
((α++ + α−− )n ) develops as a sum of terms of the form x = x1 . . . xn where xi
is either α++ or α−− . Using the defining relations of Sω (B), we can further
develop each term x as a linear combination of terms of the form αa−+ αb++ αa+−
and αa−+ αb−− αa+− where 2a + b has the same parity than n. Since n is odd, each
of these summands satisfies b 6= 0 so c(x) = 0.
Proof of Proposition 2.26. Consider the element x := TN (α++ + α−− ) − αN
++ −
αN

S
(Q).
By

its

By

A.1, in Sω (A) the elements TN (γ) and βεε′ commute. The image through the
injective gluing morphism i|b1 #b3 : Sω (A) ֒→ Sω (Q) of TN (γ) and βεε′ are
respectively TN (α++ + α−− ) and βεε′ , thus they commute. By Lemma A.3,
N
the elements αN
++ and α−− also commute with βεε′ so x commutes with each
element βεε′ . Lemma A.4 implies that x is a constant and Lemma A.5 implies
that this constant is null. This concludes the proof.

A.2

A generalization of a theorem of Bonahon

Proposition 2.26 provides the following generalization of the main theorem of
[Bon17]. Let A be an R-algebra and ρ : Cq [SL2 ]⊗k → A be a morphism of
algebras. Let ρi be the i-th component of ρ. For 1 ≤ i ≤ k, consider the
following two matrices with coefficients in A:




ρi (α++ ) ρi (α+− )
ρi (α++ )N ρi (α+− )N
(N )
Ai :=
Ai :=
.
ρi (α−+ ) ρi (α−− )
ρi (α−+ )N ρi (α−− )N
The following proposition was proved in [Bon17, Theorem 1] in the particular
case where ρi (α+− )ρi (α−+ ) = 0 for each i ∈ {1, . . . , k}.
Proposition A.6. If q is a root of unity of odd order N > 1, then one has:


(N )
(N )
TN (Tr(A1 . . . Ak )) = Tr A1 . . . Ak
.
45

Proof. By Proposition 2.26 and using that both ρ and the (k − 1)-th coproduct
∆(k−1) : Cq [SL2 ] → Cq [SL2 ]⊗k are morphisms of algebras, one has:
N
TN ◦ ρ ◦ ∆(k−1) (α++ + α−− ) = ρ ◦ ∆(k−1) (αN
++ + α−− ).
(k−1)
We conclude by remarking that
 ρ◦∆
(α++ + α−− ) = Tr(A1 . . . Ak ) and
(N
)
(N )
(k−1)
N
N
ρ◦∆
(α++ + α−− ) = Tr A1 . . . Ak
, where the second equality follows
from the fact that jB is a morphism of Hopf algebras (Lemma 2.18) hence
commutes with ∆(k−1) .
