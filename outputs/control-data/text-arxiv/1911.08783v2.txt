Abstract
The radionuclide 22 Na is a target of γ-ray astronomy searches, predicted to be produced during thermonuclear runaways driving classical novae. The 22 Na(p,γ)23 Mg reaction is the main destruction channel of
22
Na during a nova, hence, its rate is needed to accurately predict the 22 Na yield. However, experimental determinations of the resonance strengths have led to inconsistent results. In this work, we report a
measurement of the branching ratios of the 23 Al β-delayed protons, as a probe of the key 204–keV (centerof-mass) 22 Na(p,γ)23 Mg resonance strength. We report a factor of 5 lower branching ratio compared to the
most recent literature value. The variation in 22 Na yield due to nuclear data inconsistencies was assessed
using a series of hydrodynamic nova outburst simulations and has increased to a factor of 3.8, corresponding
to a factor of ∼2 uncertainty in the maximum detectability distance. This is the first reported scientific
measurement using the Gaseous Detector with Germanium Tagging (GADGET) system.

1. Introduction
Radionuclides are now routinely observed astronomically using space-based gamma-ray observatories capable of detecting their characteristic emission lines. For example, 26 Al (T1/2 = 0.72 Ma)
and 60 Fe (T1/2 = 2.6 Ma) live long enough to migrate from the stellar events producing them before they decay and manifest as diffuse emission
across the Milky Way. Attempts have been made
to benchmark nucleosynthesis in massive stars and
their supernovae using the relative amounts of observed 26 Al [1–5] and 60 Fe [6], but such benchmarks can only be applied by considering all possible sources in aggregate. More stringent constraints

on astrophysical models of particular events can be
derived using shorter-lived nuclides that manifest
as localized sources such as 44 Ti (T1/2 = 59 a),
which has been observed in the 350-year-old Cas
A core-collapse supernova remnant [7–11] and the
younger remnant of Supernova 1987A [12]. Similarly, the detection of 22 Na (T1/2 = 2.6 a) from a
classical nova explosion has been a long sought constraint [13–19]. Observations with previously and
currently deployed instruments may have been on
the cusp of detecting 22 Na [20–25], and more sensitive future missions are being planned [26, 27].
Accurate model predictions of 22 Na nucleosynthesis in novae are needed to estimate the detectability
distance and for comparison to past searches and
future observations. In addition, 20 Ne/22 Ne ratios
in presolar grains may be used to identify presolar nova grains [28–31]. Usually, neon is incorporated in grains via implantation, since noble gases

do not condense as stable compounds into grains.
However, low 20 Ne/22 Ne ratios suggests that 22 Ne
originated from in situ decay of 22 Na.
The 22 Na yield predicted by nova models is sensitive to the thermonuclear rates of the reactions
associated with explosive hydrogen burning on the
surface of a white-dwarf star accreting hydrogenrich material from a binary companion star [19, 32].
This has motivated the development of innovative experimental nuclear physics techniques, providing rates to improve predictions of the 22 Na
yield [33–46]. While 22 Na is being produced during the thermonuclear runaway driving a nova, the
22
Na(p,γ)23 Mg reaction is actively destroying it.
The 22 Na yield is related inversely to the reaction
rate and, in particular, to the strength of a single
resonance at a center-of-mass energy of 204 keV1 .
Two direct measurements ([34, 35] and [43, 44])
of the resonance strength using proton beams and
radioactive 22 Na targets have yielded values that
differ by a factor of 3.2, which results in a factor
of ≈ 2 variation in the expected 22 Na yield from
classical novae [43]. Another way to determine the
strength is to combine measurements of the proton
branching ratio Γp /Γ of the resonance with its lifetime τ and spin. The most precise literature values
[41, 45] for these quantities yield a strength that is
consistent with that from Refs. [34, 35]. It may be
tempting to consider this the conclusive arbiter for
the two inconsistent directly-measured values, but
it would be prudent to confirm the proton branching ratio and lifetime, as the aforementioned experiments faced significant challenges.
In particular, the 23 Al(βp) experiment of Ref.
[45] suffered from overwhelming β background and
relied heavily on a background subtraction model.
Pollacco et al. [47] showed that a gas filled detector can be used to overcome this problem, and
found indications of a branching ratio for the 204–
keV level significantly lower than in Ref. [45].
Presently, we report a new proton branching ratio for the 204–keV resonance, determined based
on measurements of low-energy 23 Al β-delayed protons with a new system: the Gaseous Detector
with Germanium Tagging (GADGET) [48]. GADGET is optimized for the detection of low-energy,
low-intensity β-delayed protons with complementary high-resolution high-efficiency γ-ray detection.
This Letter reports the first scientific results from

2. Experiment Setup
The experiment was performed at the National
Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL),
where a radioactive beam of 23 Al was produced
by projectile fragmentation. A 150–MeV/u, 75–
pnA primary beam of 36 Ar was accelerated using
the Coupled Cyclotron Facility [49] and impinged
upon a 9 Be transmission target, 1363 mg/cm2 in
thickness. 23 Al was isolated in flight to a purity of
69 % using the A1900 magnetic fragment separator
[50] incorporating a 300 mg/cm2 Al wedge and the
Radio Frequency Fragment Separator (RFFS) [51].
Upon exiting the RFFS, situated about 6 m upstream of GADGET, the main contaminants were
21
Na, 22 Mg, and 16 N, in decreasing order of intensity, as identified with standard ∆E-ToF method.
The beam rate was about 2000 23 Al ions per second. To optimize the 23 Al beam energy and range,
a 2–mm thick rotatable aluminum degrader, located
directly in front of the detection system, was used.
A detailed description of GADGET can be found
in [48]. Briefly, the assembly contains the Proton Detector, which is a cylindrical vessel filled
with P10 gas (set to 780 Torr for this experiment)
that functions both as a beam stop and a chargedparticle detection medium, surrounded by the Segmented Germanium Array (SeGA) [52] for coincident γ–ray detection. The beam was operated in
a pulsed mode, where 23 Al ions (T1/2 = 470 ms)
were accumulated in the Proton Detector for 0.5 s,
and then the beam was stopped for another 0.5 s
to allow their charged particle decay radiations to
be detected by ionization. The ionization electrons
were drifted towards the readout plane by an uniform electric field of 125 V/cm and amplified by
a MICROMEGAS structure [53]. An electrostatic
gating grid was used to protect the MICROMEGAS
from the large signals produced during the implantation periods. The active volume is a cylinder, 40
cm long and 10 cm in diameter. The short range of
the protons in the gas versus the near-transparency
to the β–particles enables the detection of the weak,
low–energy, protons and effectively eliminates an
otherwise overwhelming β background. The MICROMEGAS pad plane is divided into 13 pads,
labeled A-M as shown in Fig. 1. This configuration allows vetoing of high–energy protons that
might escape the active volume and deposit only

which is significantly above the region of interest
for this experiment. For interpretation of the proton spectrum a simplified decay scheme is presented
in Fig. 3. The energy calibration of the spectrum is
internal and based on the proton peak energies reported by Ref. [43] for values up to 583 keV, and on
Ref. [45] for the 866–keV proton peak energy. The
spectrum shows linearity with the reported proton
energies. In Fig. 3 we report a transition from the
8.76–MeV state in 23 Mg to the first excited state of
22
Na, corresponding to a 595–keV proton emission.
This transition is identified based on γ − p coincidences, as shown in Fig. 4. The detector resolution
is not sufficient to separate this proton peak from
the 583–keV proton peak. However, the intensity
of the coincidences is too low to account for the full
intensity of the 583–keV proton peak, and the centroid of the correlated proton peak is at 595 keV.
Therefore, we interpret this proton peak as a double peak with two similar energies. The corrected
decay scheme should affect the interpretation of the
proton intensities reported by Refs. [45, 55, 59, 60].
We do not find the 204–keV protons in coincidence
with any γ–rays except for annihilation 511–keV γ–
rays (see Fig. 4). This confirms that the final state
of the proton emission is the ground state of 22 Na,
and therefore, the initial state is the resonance of
interest.
The intensities of the 204–, 275– and 583–keV
peaks were normalized relative to the 866–keV
peak. Although the detection efficiency of the lowenergy protons is close to unity, there are some
losses due to the wall effect, mostly caused by protons absorbed in the cathode and anode planes, or

part of their energy in the active volume. In addition, it enables analysis of either most of the full
active volume (pads A-E) for higher efficiency, or to
limit the active volume into sub-sections to achieve
lower β background at the cost of efficiency loss
for higher energy protons. In the current experiment, pads F,G,L,M were not instrumented which
resulted in 50% veto efficiency for events in the AE active volume. However, in the case of 23 Al only
a small fraction of the protons are emitted above
∼1 MeV [54], hence the associated background is
insignificant.
3. Data Analysis
Fig. 2 shows the proton energy spectrum for
pad A (red) and for event-level summing of the
five central pads (A–E, blue). The β background is
substantially suppressed relative to previous experiments [45, 55], allowing the extraction of the 204–
keV peak intensity from both spectra. The single
pad spectrum shows further reduced β background
due to the smaller active volume, at the cost of a
fast-declining efficiency as function of proton energy. There are no beam contaminants that emit
β–delayed charged particles, with the exception of
the 16 N that has small α–particle branching ratio
(1.2×10−5 ). In addition, those emissions are mostly
in an energy range of 1.5 MeV to 3 MeV [56–58],
3

by 866–keV protons escaping the detector’s active
volume. A 3D GEANT4 simulation [62] was performed to calculate the efficiency corrections. For
the simulation, the 23 Al distribution along the detector axis was extracted from the drift time of the
595–keV protons relative to the corresponding 583–
keV γ–rays (see Ref. [48] for details). Unfortunately, the transverse distribution of the beam is
only coarsely known, based on the relative counts
in the different pads, which prevents a reliable efficiency calculation of the single pad spectrum for
583–keV protons and higher. For the combined
spectrum, however, the efficiency is a weak function of the transverse beam distribution due to the
5.5-cm-diameter aperture of the cathode that limits the transverse dispersion. On the other hand,
despite the excellent β background suppression in
the present experiment, extracting the intensity of
the 204–keV peak from the combined spectrum
still required modeling of the background with an
exponential function, which was chosen based on
the GEANT4 simulation, while in the pad A spectrum the 204–keV proton peak has a better signalto-background ratio, and the background can be
modeled with a linear function. For those reasons,
we used both spectra to extract the 204–keV proton peak intensity as described below, while for
the other proton peaks we used only the combined
spectrum. The calculated efficiencies for the combined spectrum were  = 0.98, 0.98, 0.97 and 0.93
for the 204–, 275–, 583– and 866–keV protons, respectively. The efficiency correction was assigned
a conservative systematic uncertainty of 3% (relative) by varying the 23 Al distribution along both
the detector axis and transverse plane. The diffusion of the 23 Al atoms was calculated to be less
than 1 cm within two lifetimes, hence the effect
on the transverse distribution is contained in the
systematic studies. Table 1 lists the efficiencycorrected intensities. Since the intensities of both
the 583–keV and 866–keV proton peaks were extracted precisely and accurately in a region with
good signal-to-background ratio in previous experiments, the agreement between the branching ratios
of the 583–keV peak is an additional verification of
the efficiency calculation. The extracted ratio for

telescope used in Ref. [59] was also relatively insensitive to β-particle backgrounds. Therefore, we consider the present value and the one from Ref. [59]
to be the most reliable. The present value provides
a much smaller uncertainty that can be attributed
in part to several orders-of-magnitude higher statistics.

that the 583–keV peak is contributed to by two separate
decays (see Sec. 3 and Fig. 3 for details).

enable reliable extraction of this ratio. We can
then use the intensity ratio between the 275–keV
and the 866–keV proton peaks in the combined
spectrum to extract the ratio between the 204–

agreement with the previous value. While the systematics of both values reflect the same efficiency
calculation, the statistics are practically independent and the combined value is taken by averaging
the above values.

In order to calculate the resonance strength using our new value for the proton branching ratio,
we must adopt a spin and lifetime for the resonance. Multiple arguments have been made for a
(7/2)+ spin and parity assignment, which we adopt
[45, 61, 66]. The only finite literature value for the
lifetime is τ = 10(3) fs from an in-beam gamma-ray
spectroscopy measurement [41]. Using these values would lead to a resonance strength of ωγ =
0.24(8) meV, which is 7 and 23 times lower than
the directly measured values from Refs. [34, 35]
and [43, 44], respectively (see Table 2). A recent
lifetime measurement by Kirsebom et al. [63] did
not yield a finte value, but a 95% C.L. upper limit
of τ < 12 fs corresponding to a lower limit on the
strength. Table 2 summarizes the resulting resonance strengths obtained using various values for
the branching ratios with both lifetimes, and the
direct measurement values.

4. Results and Discussion
We measured the ratio of intensities of the 204–
keV and 866–keV protons in 23 Al(βp)22 Na decay

βp
to be I204
/I866
= 0.063(4). To put this value into
context, it is instructive to review the previous
literature on the lowest-energy proton peak from
23
Al(βp)22 Na decay (Table 1). As suggested by
[45], it seems likely that the “peak” in Tighe et al.
[55] is really misinterpreted low-energy background
or noise combined with a threshold and, therefore,
we believe it is reasonable to disregard the measurement of Ref. [55]. The 204–keV peak intensity
in Sun et al. [60] is consistent with Ref. [45], but
based on very limited statistics. The present value
is consistent with the value reported by Peräjärvi et
al. [59], which has large error bars, but the present
value is a factor of 5 lower than the value in Ref.
[45]. The unique systematic effect in Ref. [45] was
related to the use of a Si implantation detector, for
which a very large subtraction of background from
β particles was required to extract the proton spectrum at the lowest energies. The present work was
carried out with a gas-filled detector specially designed to mitigate β-particle background in the region of interest, strongly reducing uncertainties as-

The implications of adopting various resonance
strengths on 22 Na production in novae was investigated through a series of 12 hydrodynamic simulations performed with the spherically symmetric, time-implicit, Lagrangian code SHIVA [67, 68].

the outer layers of the white dwarf star as it piles up
(50% solar, 50% white dwarf material). The model
was coupled to a nuclear reaction network containing 118 isotopes from 1 H to 48 Ti and 630 nuclear
interactions. The thermonuclear 22 Na(p,γ)23 Mg reaction rate was varied based on different assumptions about the nuclear-data inputs. The total mass
of ejected material was 3.8×1028 g for all cases. The
lowest output 22 Na mass fraction of 1.1 × 10−4 was
obtained using the rates from Refs. [43, 44] (consistent with the value reported in [44]). The highest output 22 Na mass fraction of 4.3 × 10−4 was
obtained using the present branching ratio combined with the lifetime from Ref. [41] for the 204keV resonance and the 275-keV resonance strength
from Refs. [34, 35]. Therefore, uncertainties associated with the 22 Na(p,γ)23 Mg rate translate to an
almost factor-of-four variation in 22 Na yields from
typical ONe novae corresponding to a factor-of-two
variation in maximum detectability distance for the
1.275-keV γ-ray.
Using this new resonance strength value results
in an increased 22 Na production and could lead to a
tension between some nova nucleosynthesis models
published in the literature and observational values
[21, 24] (on the contrary, see Ref. [69]). However,
this result relies on a single lifetime measurement
with 30% uncertainty. Shell-model calculations assuming spin and parity assignment of (7/2)+ predict a much shorter lifetime of ∼ 0.6 − 1.7 fs (see
Ref. [70] for calculation details), yielding a resonance strength of ωγ = 1.4-4.1 meV, which is on
the same order as the direct measurements. We
therefore suggest that the lifetime of the 7.79–MeV
excited state of 23 Mg should be re-measured, ideally to a precision better than 1 fs, prior to use with
the branching ratio to obtain a resonance strength.
Presently, we recommend adopting the more con-

servative lower limit on the resonance strength
based on the present branching ratio and the lifetime limit from Ref. [63].

5. Summary
In summary, we have measured the low-energy
Al β-delayed proton intensities with the best accuracy so far, using a new detection system, GADGET [48]. The result leads to a new proton branching ratio for the key 204–keV resonance, which is a
factor of 5 lower than the most precise and most
recent literature value [45]. If the present value
is used together with the lifetime from Ref. [41]
then the resonance strength is 7 and 23 times lower
than the two direct measurements Refs. [34, 35]
and [43, 44], respectively, compounding the existing discrepancies in this resonance strength. Inconsistencies in nuclear data have now inflated the
uncertainties in the 22 Na yield from nova models by
a factor of two.
