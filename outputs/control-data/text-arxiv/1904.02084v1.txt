Abstract. We prove an optimal order error bound in the discrete H 2 (Ω) norm for ﬁnite diﬀerence approximations of the ﬁrst boundary-value problem for the biharmonic equation in n space dimensions, with
n ∈ {2, . . . , 7}, whose generalized solution belongs to the Sobolev space H s (Ω) ∩ H02 (Ω), for 21 max(5, n) <
s ≤ 4, where Ω = (0, 1)n . The result extends the range of the Sobolev index s in the best convergence
results currently available in the literature to the maximal range admitted by the Sobolev embedding of
H s (Ω) into C(Ω) in n space dimensions.

1. Introduction
The biharmonic equation arises in a number of problems in continuum mechanics, including linear elasticity
and the solution of the Stokes equations modelling the ﬂow of a viscous incompressible ﬂuid; the biharmonic
operator also features in various nonlinear PDEs of practical relevance such as the Cahn–Hilliard equation,
which describes the process of phase separation in a binary alloy, and the Ohta–Kawasaki model for the free
energy of a diblock copolymer melt. The convergence analysis of numerical methods for the approximate
solution of the biharmonic equation has been therefore of considerable interest. We shall not attempt to
review the vast literature in this area: the reader may wish to consult the early papers by Tee [Tee64],
Bramble [Bra66], Smith [Smi68, Smi70], and Ehrlich [Ehr71], for example, for the ﬁrst analytical results in
this direction. For the numerical analysis of ﬁnite diﬀerence approximations of the biharmonic equation in the
context of the approximate solution of the Navier–Stokes equations in planar domains, we point the reader
to the book of Ben-Artzi et al. [BACF13]. In these works the data and the solution to the boundary-value
problems under consideration were assumed to have (suﬃciently) high regularity in spaces of continuously
diﬀerentiable functions.
Finite diﬀerence schemes for the biharmonic equation with nonsmooth source terms were considered by
Lazarov [Laz81], Gavrilyuk et al. [GLMP83], and Ivanović et al. [IĬS86], for example. For a detailed survey
of the relevant literature we refer the reader to the monograph of Jovanović and Süli [JS14], devoted to the
ﬁnite diﬀerence approximation of linear partial diﬀerential equations with generalized solutions.
Our objective in this paper is to prove an optimal-order error bound for ﬁnite diﬀerence approximations
of the ﬁrst boundary-value problem for the biharmonic equation in n space dimensions, with n ∈ {2, . . . , 7},
whose generalized solution belongs to the Sobolev space H s (Ω) ∩ H02 (Ω), for 12 max(5, n) < s ≤ 4, where
Ω = (0, 1)n . One of our main results, Theorem 1.1, improves [JS14, Theorem 2.69] (where the theorem is
proved for n = 2 and s < 72 ) as well as the main result in [GMP83] (where the theorem is proved for n = 2
under the assumption that the third normal derivative of u vanishes at the boundary). The restrictions on
the range of s in [JS14, Theorem 2.69] and on the third normal derivative of u in [GMP83] arise for the
following reason: in order to compare the ﬁnite diﬀerence approximation with the original problem one needs
an extension of the (generalized) solution u from Ω to Rn \ Ω that preserves the Sobolev regularity of u and
has, ideally, zero discrete boundary values. The assumptions in [JS14, Theorem 2.69] and in [GMP83] permit
the use of the symmetric extension of u across ∂Ω for that purpose. In our setting, with 21 max(5, n) < s ≤ 4,
this is no longer possible, and the main novelty of our work is to use a diﬀerent, carefully chosen, extension
of u. This extension will no longer have zero boundary values, but we will show that they can be made small
(in an appropriate norm, in terms of positive powers of the discretization parameter h), so that we can still
close the argument. The strategy of the proof is described in Section 1.2.

The relevance of our results extends beyond the numerical analysis of partial diﬀerential equations, to
statistical mechanics and probability, particularly the study of the so-called membrane model, a model for
a random interface (see the Introduction of [MS19] for an overview), which involves a centered Gaussian
measure on functions, deﬁned on lattices with uniform spacing, whose covariance matrix is given by the
Green’s function of the discrete bilaplacian with Dirichlet boundary data. In fact, the analysis pursued here
was motivated by recent work by Müller and Schweiger [MS19], where estimates for the Green’s function
of the discrete bilaplacian on squares and cubes in two and three dimensions were proved. Very recently,
Schweiger [Sch19] explored the behavior of the maximum of the solution to the four-dimensional membrane
model; for that purpose the estimates from [MS19] are not sharp enough, but methods similar to those in the
present paper can be employed to relate the Green’s function of the discrete bilaplacian with its continuous
counterpart and thereby to obtain the required bounds.
The paper is structured as follows. In the remainder of this introductory section we state our main results,
outline their proofs, and deﬁne the relevant notation that we shall use in the rest of the paper. In Section
2 we recall the deﬁnition of an extension operator, which will play a crucial role in our analysis. In Section
3 we discuss estimates of boundary values using a discrete counterpart of the fractional-order Sobolev norm
1
H 2 (∂Ω). In Section 4 we establish a discrete inverse trace theorem on Ω. In Section 5 we record, for the
sake of completeness, some summation-by-parts formulae that we will need, and in Section 6 we give the
proofs of the main theorems. The discussion is completed by two appendices, the ﬁrst of which concerns
various density results that we need and the second contains some remarks on function space interpolation,
which are of relevance in our analysis.
Our results extend to more general fourth-order elliptic elliptic operators with variable coeﬃcients, such as
those treated in [JS14, Section 2.7], with similar proofs. The main diﬀerence compared to the analysis here is
that in addition to terms appearing in our error bounds one encounters a variety of mixed terms. On can deal
with these as in the proof of Theorem 2.68 in [JS14], using the bilinear Bramble–Hilbert lemma. It should
also be possible to extend our results to other (higher order) elliptic operators, such as the polyharmonic
operator ∆k for k ≥ 3, but the study of that question is beyond the scope of this paper.
1.1. Main results. We mostly follow the notation of [JS14] (see, however, Section 1.3 for the precise
deﬁnitions). Let n ∈ N+ , Ω := (0, 1)n , Γ := ∂Ω. For h ∈ R+ such that h1 ∈ N, let Ωh := Ω ∩ (hZ)n ,
Γh := Γ ∩ (hZ)n , and
Ω̃h := [−h, 1 + h]n ∩ (hZ)n \ {−h, 1 + h}n .
Consider the elliptic boundary-value problem

(1.1)

∆2 u = f

in Ω,

u=0

on Γ,

∂ν u = 0

on Γ,

where ∂ν denotes the derivative in the normal direction (ν is a unit outward normal vector to Γ). We
approximate the solution of this problem by the ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme (compare [JS14, Section 1.9.4])
∆2h U = T h,2,...,2 f
(1.2)

U =0

in Ωh ,
on Γh ,

on Γh .

h
Here U is deﬁned on Ω̃h , D0,ν
U (x) := 2h
U (x + hν) − U (x − hν) 1, and T h,2,...,2 f is a smoothing operator
acting on f , deﬁned by convolving f with a B-spline on the scale h (see below for the precise deﬁnition).
The ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme (1.2) makes sense in any dimension n, as the smoothing operator T h,2,...,2
maps f ∈ H s−4 into a continuous function whenever s > 52 (cf. [JS14, Theorem 1.69]).
Our objective is to prove an error bound in the discrete Sobolev norm k · kHh2 (Ωh ) (which is denoted by
k · kW22 (Ωh ) in [JS14, Section 2.2.4]).

1At the singular points (i.e., at the vertices and points on the faces/edges) of Γh there are up to n possible boundary normal
vectors. For (1.2) we consider all of them. Because U = 0 on Γh by assumption, this corresponds to setting U = 0 at all points
of Ω̃h \ (Ωh ∪ Γh ) that have distance h to a singular point of Γh .

Theorem 1.1. Suppose that 21 max(5, n) < s ≤ 4, and let u ∈ H s (Ω) ∩ H02 (Ω); then, there exists a positive
constant C = C(n, s), independent of h, such that
(1.3)

ku − U kHh2 (Ωh ) ≤ Chs−2 kukH s (Ω) .

This improves [JS14, Theorem 2.69] (where the above result was proved for n = 2 and 52 < s ≤ 4 in the
more general setting of fourth-order elliptic equations with nonsmooth variable coeﬃcients, but the order of
convergence O(hmin{s−2,3/2} | log h|1−|sgn(s−7/2)| ) established there was optimal only in the case of 25 < s < 27 ,
3
and is reduced to the suboptimal rate of O(h 2 ), instead of the optimal rate of O(hs−2 ), for 27 < s ≤ 4) as well
as the main result in [GMP83] (where the theorem was proved for n = 2 under the additional assumption
that the third normal derivative of u vanishes at the boundary).
Our method also yields estimates for other discretizations of the boundary conditions. Consider, for
instance, the ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme
∆2h U ∗ = T h,2,...,2 f
(1.4)

in Ωh ,

U∗ = 0

on Γh ,

Dνh U ∗ = 0

on Γh .


Here again U ∗ is deﬁned on Ω̃h , and Dνh U ∗ (x) := h1 U ∗ (x + hν) − U ∗ (x) . The conditions U ∗ = 0 and
Dνh U ∗ = 0 on Γh are equivalent to U ∗ = 0 on Ω̃h \ Ωh , so that we could equivalently consider the ﬁnite
diﬀerence scheme
(1.5)

∆2h U ∗ = T h,2,...,2 f
U∗ = 0

in Ωh ,
on Ω̃h \ Ωh .

For this diﬀerence scheme we can show the following error bound.
Theorem 1.2. Suppose that 21 max(5, n) < s ≤ 3, and let u ∈ H s (Ω) ∩ H02 (Ω); then, there exists a positive
constant C = C(n, s), independent of h, such that
(1.6)

ku − U ∗ kHh2 (Ωh ) ≤ Chs−2 kukH s (Ω) .

In Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 we made the assumption 12 max(5, n) < s. In view of the fact that the problem
(1.1) makes sense already for s > 32 , the requirement 12 max(5, n) < s might seem surprising. The condition
s > n2 ensures that u is continuous. Otherwise, ku − U kHh2 (Ωh ) and ku − U ∗ kHh2 (Ωh ) would be undeﬁned.
The condition s > 25 implies that T h,2,...,2 f is continuous so that its pointwise values are deﬁned and the
ﬁnite diﬀerence schemes (1.2) and (1.4) make sense. It should be possible to relax the assumption s > n2
by replacing u in the expressions ku − U kHh2 (Ωh ) and ku − U ∗ kHh2 (Ωh ) with a suitably molliﬁed version of u.
Similarly, one can relax the assumption s > 52 by replacing T h,2,...,2 with a stronger molliﬁcation operator.
We will not pursue these alternatives here; see however [Sch19] for a version of Theorem 1.2 with s < 25 .
1.2. Outline of the proof. We discuss the proof of Theorem 1.1 only; the proof of Theorem 1.2 is very
similar. We proceed similarly to the proof of [JS14, Theorem 2.69]. In fact, when s < 27 we could directly
use the argument in [JS14] with only minor notational changes. Let us review that argument here brieﬂy.
We begin by extending u symmetrically across Γ to a H s -function û on (−1, 2)n such that kûkH s ((−1,2)n ) ≤
CkukH s (Ω) . Here and henceforth C signiﬁes a generic positive constant, which may depend on the Sobolev
index s and on the number of space dimensions n, but is independent of the discretization parameter h. Let
E := û − U . Then, E satisﬁes
E=0

on Γh ,

h
D0,ν
E=0

on Γh ,

and we calculate (compare [JS14, Equation (2.209)])
∆2h E = ∆2h û − ∆2h U = ∆2h û − T h,2,...,2 f = ∆2h û − T h,2,...,2 ∆2 û.
Using summations by parts we obtain
k∇2h EkL2h (Ωh ) ≤ k∆2h û − T h,2,...,2 ∆2 ûkH −2 (Ωh ) ,
h

where ∇2h is the discrete Hessian. Now one can use the Bramble–Hilbert lemma (cf. [JS14]) to deduce that
the right-hand side is bounded by Chs−2 kukH s (Ω) , which directly implies (1.3).
When s ≥ 72 one can no longer extend u symmetrically across the boundary while preserving its Sobolev
h
regularity. This means that we cannot make D0,ν
u equal to 0 on Γ, and therefore the above argument based
on summation by parts no longer works.
h
Our alternative approach is as follows. Although we cannot ensure that the boundary values of D0,ν
E are
exactly zero, we will show that they can nevertheless be made small in an appropriate norm. To this end, we
will ﬁrst show (in Section 2) that we can take a slightly diﬀerent extension ũ with kũkH s ((−1,2)n ) ≤ CkukH s (Ω) ,
7
2 ≤ s ≤ 4, such that ũ and its derivatives vanish on the hyperplanes supporting the faces of Γ. This will
allow us to estimate the boundary values in an optimal space. In fact, in Section 3 we prove that
h
[D0,ν
ũ]

Hh2 (Γh )

≤ Chs−2 kũkH s (Ω)

(see that section also for a precise deﬁnition of the Hh2 (Γh )-seminorm appearing on the left-hand side of this
inequality). Then, in Section 4, we prove that for any function g on the boundary there is a lattice function
w such that
w = 0 on Γh ,
h
D0,ν w = g on Γh ,
and
k∇2h wkL2h (Ωh ) ≤ C[g] 21 h .
Hh (Γ )

We shall construct w by giving an explicit extension using the Fourier series representation of the boundary
values, which we then carefully cut oﬀ to comply with the boundary conditions.
h
Let now Ê be such a function w corresponding to g = D0,ν
ũ. We can apply the argument above to E − Ê
(which has zero boundary values) and ﬁnd that


k∇2h (E − Ê)kL2 (Ωh ) ≤ C hs−2 kukH s (Ω) + k∆2h ÊkH −2 (Ωh ) .
h

Thus, by observing that

k∆2h ÊkH −2 (Ωh ) ≤ Ck∇2h ÊkL2 (Ωh ) ≤ C[D0,ν
ũ]
h

Hh2 (Γh )

≤ Chs−2 kukH s (Ω) ,

we directly deduce (1.3). We shall present the details of the argument in Section 6. In that section we shall
also make several remarks that concern possible modiﬁcations and generalizations of the results.
1.3. Notation and preliminaries. Our notation is based on that in [JS14], however we made some changes
that we will review in the following.
C denotes a constant that may change from line to line and may be dependent on the Sobolev index, s,
and the number of space dimensions, n, but is always independent of h. Similarly C(h) denotes a constant
that may change from line to line and may depend on h as well.
For s ≥ 0 and Ξ ⊂ Rn open with Lipschitz boundary we deﬁne the Sobolev space H s (Ξ) as the space of
restrictions of H s (Rn )-functions to Ξ. By H0s (Ξ) we denote the closure of the set of all Cc∞ (Ξ)-functions in
the k · kH s (Ξ) -norm.
Assume that Ξ := I1 × · · · × In , where Ij ⊂ R are (possibly unbounded) open intervals. This assumption
ensures that we have Hn−1 -almost everywhere on ∂Ξ an axiparallel normal vector. Given a k ∈ N0 with
s
(Ξ) the space of all functions u ∈ H s (Ξ) such that the traces of ∂νi u for
k + 12 < s, we denote by H(k)
/ N + 12 , by setting
0 ≤ i ≤ k vanish on each face of ∂Ξ. We extend this deﬁnition to k > s − 21 , provided s ∈
s
s
H(k)
(Ξ) = H(⌊s−1/2⌋)
(Ξ).
s
There are several other equivalent deﬁnitions of H(k)
(Ξ). Let Cc∞ (Ξ) denote the space of functions on Ξ,
which are in C ∞ (Ξ), for which all derivatives admit continuous extensions to Ξ, and which are supported in
K ∩Ξ for some K ⊂ Rn compact. In other words, Cc∞ (Ξ) denotes the set of restrictions of Cc∞ (Rn )-functions
s
to Ξ, where the equivalence follows from Whitney’s extension theorem [Whi34]. Then, H(k)
(Ξ) is also the
s
∞
closure in the H (Ξ)-norm of the set of all functions in Cc (Ξ) whose derivatives up to order k vanish on
s
∂Ξ Furthermore, H(k)
(Ξ) is equal to H s (Ξ) ∩ H0k+1 (Ξ) if s ≥ k + 1, and equal to H0s (Ξ) if s ≤ k + 1. In
s
particular, the space H s (Ω) ∩ H02 (Ω) from the main theorems can now be written as H(1)
(Ω).

The fact that these deﬁnitions are equivalent should not be surprising. Nonetheless we could not locate
a reference for this precise equivalence result, and so we present its proof in Appendix A.
Given a j ∈ N, we let θj be the standard univariate
centered
B-spline of degree j − 1, deﬁned, for example,


as the indicator function of the closed interval − 21 , 12 convolved with itself j − 1 times (cf. [JS14, Section
1.9.4]). Using this, we deﬁne the smoothing operator Tih,j for 1 ≤ i ≤ n as

Tih,j f := f ∗i θj
h
h
where ∗i means convolution in the variable xi . This is a well-deﬁned operator on distributions on Rn .
Furthermore, we set
T h,j,...,j f := T1h,j ◦ · · · ◦ Tnh,j f.

Each θj is in H t (R) for any t < j − 21 . Using this, one can verify (cf. [JS14, Section 1.9.4]) that T h,j,...,j is a
bounded linear operator from H t (Rn ) to Cb (Rn ) whenever t > −j + 12 .

Given a unit vector a ∈ Rn , we deﬁne the diﬀerence quotients Dah v(x) := h1 (v(x + ha) − v(x)), D−a

2. Construction of a good extension
At a certain point in our argument it will be necessary to localize the functions concerned in order to deal
with the 2n corners of Ω = (0, 1)n separately. Actually, it is most convenient to do so right from the start.
Thus we shall use a partition of unity, which allows us to split u into 2n parts localized near the corners.
These
 parts
n can all be dealt with in a similar way, so we focus on one of them and assume that u is supported
in 0, 23 .
s
Recall that H(1)
(Ω) denotes the space of functions u ∈ H s (Ω) for which u and the normal derivative
vanish on ∂Ω.

n
s
Lemma 2.1. Let 23 < s ≤ 4, let u ∈ H(1)
(Ω) be supported in 0, 32 . Then, there exists a function
ũ ∈ H0s ((−1, 1)n ) such that kũkH s ((−1,1)n ) ≤ CkukH s (Ω) , ũ|Ω = u, and ũ = 0, ∇ũ = 0 on the (n − 1)dimensional hyperplanes xi = 0 for i ∈ {1, . . . , n} in the sense of traces.
Because ũ ∈ H0s ((−1, 1)n ), we can extend ũ outside (−1, 1)n by zero to a function in H s (Rn ) (that we
continue to call ũ).
The construction of the extension is classical; see, e.g., [LM72a, Section 11.5]. Nonetheless we give some
details, in particular because a similar construction will be used in Section 4.
Proof. There exist λ−1 , λ−2 ∈ R such that
λ−1 + λ−2 2k = (−1)k

for k ∈ {2, 3}.

6

We also let λ1 = 1. Then we deﬁne the extension ũ of u by
X
X
ũ(x1 , . . . , xn ) =
...
ε1 =1 if x1 ≥0
ε1 ∈{−1,−2} if x1 <0

εn =1 if xn ≥0
εn ∈{−1,−2} if xn <0

For example, for n = 2 we have

for x1 ≥ 0, x2 ≥ 0,
for x1 < 0, x2 ≥ 0,
for x1 ≥ 0, x2 < 0,
for x1 < 0, x2 < 0.

This extension is constructed by applying an extension operator similar to the one in [LM72a, Section 2.2]
once across every hyperplane (or in other words by applying a tensorized version of that extension operator).
One easily checks that both ũ = 0 and ∇ũ = 0 on the face xi = 0 for i ∈ {1, . . . , n}. In addition, the
n
support of ũ is contained in − 32 , 23 ⊂ (−1, 1)n .
s
It remains to show that ũ ∈ H ((−1, 1)n ) and

(2.1)

kũkH s ((−1,1)n ) ≤ CkukH s (Ω) .

4
For this we use interpolation. If s = 4, and u ∈ H(1)
(Ω) observe that by the construction of ũ for k ∈
k
{0, 1, 2, 3} the traces of ∂i ũ from the two sides of {xi = 0} agree. This implies that ũ ∈ H 4 ((−1, 1)n )
1
and kũkH 4 ((−1,1)n ) ≤ CkukH 4 (Ω) . If s = 1 and u ∈ H(1)
(Ω) = H01 (Ω) we can use the same argument to
3
hobtain (2.1) once iagain. Now, by Lemma B.3 from the Appendix, for any 2 < s ≤ 4 the interpolation space

3. Estimate of the boundary values
1

We want to estimate the boundary values in the fractional discrete Sobolev space Hh2 . In order to do so,
we ﬁrst deﬁne the appropriate (semi-)norms.
Let S be a subset of Rn that is contained in an axiparallel (n − 1)-dimensional aﬃne subspace of Rn such
that S ∩ (hZ)n 6= ∅, and let w : S ∩ (hZ)n → R. We then deﬁne

For the discrete trace theorem in the following section we will need to use the extension by zero of D0,ν
ũ and
1

Dνh ũ. Therefore we directly estimate the Hh2 -seminorm of that extension in the following lemma.2 At the
h
ﬁrst glance it might seem problematic that we are extending D0,ν
ũ by zero, because for s ≥ 25 this extension
h
does not preserve the H s -regularity of ũ. However it turns out that it is possible to estimate [D0,ν
ũ] 12 by
Hh

expressions that involve several derivatives in the direction en , but at most one derivative in the directions
ei for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, so our assumptions on the boundary values are suﬃcient.

We can assume that i = n, the other cases being analogous. For simplicity we identify Rn−1 with the
hyperplane Rn−1 × {0} ⊂ Rn , and write x = (x′ , xn ), with x′ := (x1 , . . . , xn−1 ).
Before embarking on the proof of our main result, we state and prove two estimates that we will need.
Lemma 3.2. Let s > 12 max(3, n) and v ∈ H s (Rn ) such that v = 0 and ∂n v = 0 on Rn−1 in the sense
of trace. Let h > 0, let x′ ∈ (hZ)n−1 , x̂′ ∈ Rn−1 × {0} and suppose that |x′ − x̂′ |∞ < h2 . Let further
Qh/2 (x′ ) := x′ + (−h/2, h/2)n−1 be the (n − 1)-dimensional axiparallel cube of edge-length h centered at x′ .
If s ≤ 4, we have that
n

|v(x′ , h) − v(x′ , −h) − v(x̂′ , h) + v(x̂′ , −h)| ≤ Chs− 2 kvkH s (Qh/2 (x′ )×R) ,

(3.3)

and if s ≤ 3 we have that

n

|v(x′ , 0) − v(x′ , −h) − v(x̂′ , 0) + v(x̂′ , −h)| ≤ Chs− 2 kvkH s (Qh/2 (x′ )×R) .

(3.4)

Proof. We begin with (3.3). By scaling and translating we can assume that without loss of generality
that h = 1 and x′ = 0. Because s > n2 the left-hand side of (3.3) is bounded by CkvkH s (Q1/2 (0)×(−2,2)) .
Furthermore it vanishes when v is a polynomial of degree at most 3. Indeed the boundary condition ensures
that each monomial of degree at most 3 has degree at least 2 in xn and the left-hand side vanishes for
such monomials. So (3.3) follows from the Bramble–Hilbert lemma (applied in H s (Q1/2 (0) × (−2, 2))). The
estimate (3.4) can be proved analogously.

Lemma 3.3. Let s > 32 and v ∈ H s ((0, ∞)n−1 × R). Suppose that for all i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1} we have v = 0
on {xi = 0} in the sense of trace, and that furthermore we have ∂n v = 0 on {xn = 0} in the sense of trace.
Let v̂ be the extension by zero in the first n − 1 variables of v to Rn , i.e.,
(
v(x) x ∈ (0, ∞)n−1 × R,
v̂(x) :=
0
otherwise,
and let h > 0. If s ≤ 4, then we have that

H 2 (Rn−1 )

≤ Chs−1 kvkH s ((0,∞)n−1 ×R) ,

and if s ≤ 3, then we have that

≤ Chs−1 kvkH s ((0,∞)n−1 ×R) .

Proof. Let us deﬁne the function spaces Gs ((0, ∞)n−1 × R) for s ∈ [0, ∞) \ 21 , 23 as follows. When s > 32 ,
Gs is the space that is mentioned in the statement of the lemma, i.e.,
(3.6)

Gs ((0, ∞)n−1 ×R) := H s ((0, ∞)n−1 ×R)∩{u : u = 0 on ∂((0, ∞)n−1 ×R)}∩{u : ∂n u = 0 on (0, ∞)n−1 ×{0}}.

and if s < 12 ,

Gs ((0, ∞)n−1 × R) := H s ((0, ∞)n−1 × R).

According to Lemma B.4 from the Appendix we have that, for s ∈

Gs ((0, ∞)n−1 × R) = G4 ((0, ∞)n−1 × R), G1 ((0, ∞)n−1 × R) 4−s ,

Thus it suﬃces to prove (3.5) for s = 4 and s = 1 and (3.6) for s = 3 and s = 1, and then the result follows
by interpolation. We prove the former two statements; the proofs of the latter two are completely analogous.
If s = 1, the condition that v = 0 on {xi = 0} in the sense of trace ensures that v̂ ∈ H 1 (Rn ) and
kv̂kH 1 (Rn ) ≤ kvkH 1 ((0,∞)n−1 ×R) . Now we can use standard trace theorems to bound

If s = 4 the proof is less straightforward. The main diﬃculty is that v̂ is in general not in H 4 (Rn ). Instead
we write
Z h
h2
(h − s)2 3
v(·, h) = v(·, 0) + h∂n v(·, 0) + ∂n2 v(·, 0) +
∂n v(·, s) ds.

This does not make sense as a pointwise equality, but we can interpret it as an equality in H 2 ((0, ∞)n−1 ),
with the integral on the right-hand side being understood as a Bochner integral. Similarly, we have

(h + s)2 3

v(·, −h) = v(·, 0) − h∂n v(·, 0) + ∂n2 v(·, 0) +

Because we know that v(·, 0) = 0 and ∂n v(·, 0) = 0 in H 2 ((0, ∞)n−1 ), we deduce from this that

Proof of Lemma 3.1. We begin with (3.1). As before, we shall assume without loss of generality that i = n,
and we identify Rn−1 with Rn−1 × {0} ⊂ Rn and write x = (x′ , xn ).

Then, gh,n is the restriction of gn to (hZ)n , and our goal will be to relate the discrete Hh -norm of gh,n and
the continuous H 1/2 -norm of gn . We begin by estimating the latter.
Applying Lemma 3.3 to hgh,n we obtain

H 2 (Rn−1 )

≤ Chs−2 kũkH s (Rn ) .

Next, let x′ ∈ (hZ)n−1 , x̂′ ∈ Rn−1 , and suppose that |x′ − x̂′ |∞ < h2 . Recall that Qh/2 (x′ ) = x′ +
(−h/2, h/2)n−1 is the (n − 1)-dimensional axiparallel cube of edge-length h centered at x′ . Then, Lemma
3.2 implies that
n

|ũ(x′ , h) − ũ(x′ , −h) − ũ(x̂′ , h) + ũ(x̂′ , −h)| ≤ Chs− 2 kũkH s (Qh/2 (x′ )×R) .
If x′i > 0 for all i = 1, . . . , n − 1, then
|gn (x′ ) − gn (x̂′ )| =

(3.9)

1
|ũ(x′ , h) − ũ(x′ , −h) − ũ(x̂′ , h) + ũ(x̂′ , −h)|.
2h

On the other hand, if xi ≤ 0 for some i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1}, then ũ(x′ , h) = ũ(x′ , −h) = gn (x′ , 0) = 0 and
(
1
|ũ(x̂′ , h) − ũ(x̂′ , −h)| for x′ ∈ (0, ∞)n−1 ,
′
|gn (x̂ )| = 2h

otherwise.
This, together with (3.9), implies that we have in any case
|gn (x′ ) − gn (x̂′ )| ≤

1
|ũ(x′ , h) − ũ(x′ , −h) − ũ(x̂′ , h) + ũ(x̂′ , −h)|.

Thus we get that

Now let x′ , y ′ ∈ (hZ)n−1 , x̂′ ∈ Qh/2 (x′ ) and ŷ ′ ∈ Qh/2 (y ′ ). We then have that
|gn (x′ ) − gn (y ′ )| ≤ |gn (x̂′ ) − g(ŷ ′ )| + |g(x′ ) − g(x̂′ )| + |g(y ′ ) − g(ŷ ′ )|.

This implies that |gn (x′ ) − gn (y ′ )|2 ≤ 3 |gn (x̂′ ) − gn (ŷ ′ )|2 + |gn (x′ ) − gn (x̂′ )|2 + |gn (y ′ ) − gn (ŷ ′ )|2 , and, using
(3.10), we deduce that
(3.11)
|gn (x′ ) − gn (y ′ )|2 ≤ 3|gn (x̂′ ) − gn (ŷ ′ )|2 + Ch2s−2−n kũk2H s (Qh (x′ )×(−2h,2h)) + Ch2s−2−n kũk2H s (Qh (y′ )×(−2h,2h)) .
Thus, taking the average of (3.11) over all x̂′ ∈ Qh/2 (x′ ) and ŷ ′ ∈ Qh/2 (y ′ ), we obtain

We want to construct a function Ê such that Ê and E agree on Γh and such that the Hh2 -norm of Ê is

k∇2h Êi kL2 (Ωh ) ≤ Chs−2 kukH s (Ω) . Then we can choose Ê = i Êi , which will have the desired properties.
As the Êi can be constructed analogously, we shall focus on Ên only.

≤ Chs−2 kukH s (Ω) .
Unfortunately, ã does not yet have the correct boundary values at {xi = 0} for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. To rectify
this we use a discrete projection from H 2 to H02 . First we deﬁne the corresponding continuous projection.
It is deﬁned in a similar way as the extension we used in the proof of Lemma 2.1, namely by tensorizing the
restriction operator from [LM72a, Section 11.5]. Thus we choose λ−1 , λ−2 ∈ R such that
λ−1 + λ−2 2k = (−1)k+1

for k ∈ {0, 1}.

(i.e., λ−1 = −3, λ−2 = 2); we let λ1 = 1 and deﬁne a restriction operator R : H 2 (Rn−1 ) → H02 ((0, ∞)n−1 )
by
X

Ru(x) :=
ε1 ∈{1,−1,−2}

εn ∈{1,−1,−2}

It is easy to check that we indeed have Ru ∈ H02 ((0, ∞)n−1 ) and kRukH 2 ((0,∞)n−1 ) ≤ CkukH 2 (Rn−1 ) . If we
extend Ru by zero to Rn−1 we can also consider R as an operator mapping H 2 (Rn−1 ) to itself. Note that if

x′ ∈ (hZ)n−1 , then Ru(x′ ) depends only on u|(hZ)n−1 . Thus we can deﬁne Rh : Hh2 ((hZ)n−1 ) → Hh2 ((hZ)n−1 )
by

k∇2h Rh uh kL2h ([0,∞)n−1 ∩(hZ)n−1 ) ≤ Ck∇2h uh kL2h ((hZ)n−1 ) .

h
Indeed, these estimates follow from the discrete chain rule. The only exception are the terms Dih D−i
Rh uh (x′ )
in (4.8), which are not, a priori, controlled on {xi = 0}. However an explicit calculation shows that for such
x′ one has
Rh uh (x′ + hei )

so that these terms, which are ‘crossing the boundary’, are still controlled.3
We now apply Rh along every slice (hZ)n−1 × {xn }, i.e., we set
b(x) := Rh ã(·, xn )(x′ ).

h
Then by construction of Rh we have b = 0 and D0,i
b(x) = 0 on {xi = 0}. Furthermore, b is supported


and we have b = 0 on {xn = 0}. We know that D0,n

n−1
Rh gh,n = gh,n on [0, ∞)

Rh and D0,n
commute.
We next estimate k∇2h bkL2 (Ωh ) = k∇2h Rh ãkL2 (Ωh ) . If i, j ≤ n − 1 then (4.8) implies that
h
kDih D−j
Rh ãkL2 (Ωh ) ≤ C∇2h ãkL2h ((hZ)n−1 ) .

When taking derivatives in the direction en we use (4.7) and the fact that D±n
and Rh commute, to obtain
(for i < n) that
h
h
kDih D−n
Rh ãkL2 (Ωh ) = kDih Rh D−n

and similarly, using (4.6),
h
h
kDnh D−n
Rh ãkL2 (Ωh ) ≤ CkDnh D−n

If we combine the last three estimates and use (4.5) we deduce that

k∇2h bkL2 (Ωh ) = k∇2h ãkL2 (Ωh ) ≤ Chs−2 kukH s (Ω) .
Thus we can set b = Ên , and have shown that Ên has all of the desired properties.

Proof of Lemma 4.2. The proof is quite similar to the proof of Lemma 4.1. Let us outline the diﬀerences.
In Step 2 we use a diﬀerent extension operator, namely

construction of R, and one can therefore also expect Rh to be well-behaved at the boundary.

so that a∗ (x′ , 0) = 0 and D−n
a(x′ , 0) = gh,n

again obtain

5. Summation-by-parts formulae and Poincaré inequalities
For the sake of completeness we record some summation-by-parts formulae that we will use in the following.
These formulae are adapted to the two boundary conditions that we encounter in (1.2) and (1.4). Zero
boundary conditions are easier to deal with, so we begin with those.
Lemma 5.1. Let v, ϕ : Ω̃h → R, and assume that ϕ = Dνh ϕ = 0 on Γh .
We have that

hn ∆2h v(z)ϕ(z) =
(5.1)
i,j=1 z∈Ωh ∪Γh

z∈Ωh ∪Γh

So, if we define the scalar product (f, g)L2h,∗ (Ωh ∪Γh ) on functions f, g : Ω̃h → Rn×n by
(f, g)L2h,∗ (Ωh ∪Γh ) :=

n
X X

hn fi,j (z)gi,j (z),

z∈Ωh i,j=1

we have
(∆2h v, ϕ)L2h (Ωh ∪Γh ) = (∇2h v, ∇2h ϕ)L2h,∗ (Ωh ∪Γh ) .

(5.2)

Furthermore, we have, for any i ∈ {1, . . . , n}, that

h
h
(Dih D−i
v, ϕ)L2h (Ωh ∪Γh ) = (v, Dih D−i
ϕ)L2h (Ωh ∪Γh ) .

(5.3)

Proof. Observe that we have the summation-by-parts identity

for f, g : (hZ) → R such that at least one of f, g has compact support, and i ∈ {1, . . . , n} (this follows from
the one-dimensional case, where it can be easily checked). This immediately implies (5.3).
Next, observe that none of the terms in (5.1) depends on values of v or ϕ outside of Ω̃h . Thus we can
extend v and ϕ by 0 to all of (hZ)n and prove equivalently that
X

hn ∆2h v(z)ϕ(z) =

z∈(hZ)n

hn ∆h v(z)∆h ϕ(z) =

z∈(hZ)n

This follows from repeated application of (5.4).



For the case of the boundary conditions in (1.2), the situation is slightly more involved. We deﬁne, for
i, j ∈ {1, . . . , n} with i 6= j, the set
Γhij := {z ∈ Γh : z + hAij ⊂ [0, 1]n },

where Aij is the discrete square
Aij := {0, ei , −ej , ei − ej },

and note that
z ∈ Γh \ Γhij

=⇒

(z + hAij ) ∩ Ωh = ∅ if i 6= j.

In addition, if we also define for f, g : Ω̃h → R the scalar product

By combining the last four displayed equalities we deduce (5.5). With a similar argument we can obtain
(5.7) from (5.3).

Next, we state Poincaré-type inequalities for the two sets of boundary conditions considered.
Lemma 5.3. Let v : Ω̃h → R, and suppose that ϕ = Dνh ϕ = 0 on Γh . Then,
(5.8)

kvkHh2 (Ωh ) ≤ Ck∇2h vkL2h,∗ (Ωh ) .

h
Lemma 5.4. Let v : Ω̃h → R, and suppose that ϕ = D0,ν
ϕ = 0 on Γh . Then,

(5.9)

kvkHh2 (Ωh ) ≤ Ck∇2h vkL2h,∼ (Ωh ) .

16

STEFAN MÜLLER, FLORIAN SCHWEIGER, AND ENDRE SÜLI

Proof of Lemma 5.3. We can extend v by 0 to (hZ)n without changing the statement of the lemma. Now
observe that for f : (hZ)n → R with support contained in a cube of side-length L, and i ∈ {1, . . . , n}, we
have the Poincaré inequality
h
kf kL2h ((hZ)n ) ≤ CLkD±i
f kL2h ((hZ)n ) .
Indeed this follows from the one-dimensional case, which can be proved by a straightforward summation by
parts. If we apply this inequality to v and ∇v, we easily deduce (5.8).

(
v(z) for z ∈ Ωh
Proof of Lemma 5.4. Let ṽ(z) :=
. Then, ṽ satisﬁes the assumptions of Lemma 5.3, so
0
otherwise
that
kṽkHh2 (Ωh ) ≤ Ck∇2h ṽkL2h,∗ (Ωh ) .
Furthermore it is easy to check that
k∇2h ṽkL2h,∗ (Ωh ) ≤ k∇2h vkL2h,∼ (Ωh )
and
kvkHh2 (Ωh ) ≤ 2kṽkHh2 (Ωh ) ,
and hence we directly deduce (5.9).



6. Proofs of the main theorems
We have already sketched the proof of Theorem 1.1 in the Introduction. We now provide additional
details.
Proof of Theorem 1.1. As was mentioned at the start of Section 2, we can assume that u is supported in
 2 2
0, 3 . Let E : Ω̃h → R be deﬁned by E := u − U . Then,
E=0

on Γh ,

h
h
D0,ν
E = D0,ν

on Γh .

Let Ê be the function from Lemma 4.1. Then,
E − Ê = 0
h
D0,ν (E − Ê) = 0

on Γh ,
on Γh .

Therefore, using the results from Section 5 we deduce that
k∇2h (E − Ê)k2L2

h
h
h,∼ (Ω ∪Γ )

= (∆2h (E − Ê), E − Ê)L2h (Ωh ∪Γh )
= (∆2h E, E − Ê)L2h (Ωh ∪Γh ) − (∇2h Ê, ∇2h (E − Ê))L2h,∼ (Ωh ∪Γh ) .

(6.1)
We can rewrite ∆2h E as follows

∆2h E = ∆2h ũ − ∆2h U = ∆2h ũ − T 2,...,2 f = ∆2h ũ − T h,2,...,2 ∆2 ũ

If we insert this into (6.1) and use the summation-by-parts formula (5.7) we arrive at
n
X
h
(ϕi , Dih D−i
(E − Ê))L2h (Ωh ∪Γh ) − (∇2h Ê, ∇2h (E − Ê))L2h,∼ (Ωh ∪Γh )

The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side here is bounded by Chs−2 kukH s (Ω) by construction of Ê. The
summands of the sum can be bounded using the Bramble–Hilbert lemma as in the proof of [JS14, Theorem
2.68]. Let us sketch the argument for completeness:
Recall that
h,2 h,2
Ti+1 . . . Tnh,2 ∆ũ(x).
ϕi (x) = ∆h ũ(x) − T1h,2 . . . Ti−1
Because s > n2 ,
|∆h ũ(x)| ≤ C(h)kũkL∞ (x+(−h,h)n) ≤ C(h)kũkH s (x+(−h,h)n) .
In addition s >

2

implies according to [JS14, Theorem 1.67] that

h,2 h,2
|T1h,2 . . . Ti−1
Ti+1 . . . Tnh,2 ∆ũ(x)| ≤ C(h)kũkH s (x+(−h,h)n) .

Thus ϕi (x) is a bounded linear functional of ũ ∈ H s (x+(−h, h)n ). This functional vanishes when ũ|x+(−h,h)n
is a polynomial of degree at most 3. Indeed, then ∆ũ(y) is equal to some aﬃne function a(y), and ∆h ũ(x) =
a(x). On the other hand, the smoothing operators Tjh,2 map aﬃne functions to themselves, so that ϕi (x) = 0.
To summarize ϕi (x) is a bounded linear functional of ũ ∈ H s (x + (−h, h)n ) that vanishes on polynomials
of degree at most 3. Hence by the Bramble–Hilbert lemma it is bounded by C(h)[ũ]H s (x+(−h,h)n) for the
range of s as in the statement of the theorem. Using a scaling argument to determine the correct prefactor
of h, we obtain
kϕi kL2h,∼ (Ωh ∪Γh ) ≤ Chs−2 [ũ]H s (Rn ) ≤ Chs−2 kukH s (Ω)

(6.3)

for those s.
Now we substitute (6.3) into (6.2) and obtain the bound
k∇2h EkL2h,∼ (Ωh ∪Γh ) ≤ Chs−2 kukH s (Ω)
for the range of s as in the statement of the theorem. The discrete Poincaré inequality, Lemma 5.4, immediately implies the asserted error bound.

Proof of Theorem 1.2. The proof is the same as that of Theorem 1.1. The only diﬀerences are that we work
with the inner product (·, ·)L2h,∗ (Ωh ∪Γh ) instead of (·, ·)L2h,∼ (Ωh ∪Γh ) , use Ê ∗ instead of Ê, and Lemma 5.3
instead of Lemma 5.4.

Remark 6.1. By Section 4 we know that there are extensions of the boundary values of ũ with controlled
k · k∼ -norm and k · k∗ -norm respectively. In fact, the optimal such extension is in both cases the biharmonic
extension of the boundary values, i.e., the unique function V with the given boundary values that satisﬁes
h
∆2h V = 0 in Ω. Indeed, if ψ is a function such that ψ = 0, D0,ν
ψ = 0 on Γ, then
k∇2h (V + ψ)k2L2

and (∇2h V, ∇2h ψ)L2h,∼ (Ωh ∪Γh ) = 0, and similarly for k · kL2h,∗ (Ωh ∪Γh ) . This means that we could assume Ê to be
discretely biharmonic, and this would simplify the proof of Theorem 1.1 slightly. However, for more general
fourth-order elliptic operators one cannot use this fact, so we chose to avoid it here.
Remark 6.2. Using function space interpolation as in Lemma B.3 it is possible to deduce the intermediate
cases of Theorem 1.1 and 1.2 from the borderline cases s = 4 (or s = 3) and s = 52 + ε. Our method of proof
for s = 4 (or s = 3) however directly yields the desired bounds for all relevant s, without the need to resort
to function space interpolation.

Appendix A. Density results
s
This section is concerned with the various deﬁnitions of the space H(k)
in the Introduction. Let us recall
what we want to prove.

Lemma A.1. Let Let Ξ = I1 × · · · × In , where Ij ⊂ R are (possibly unbounded) open intervals, s ∈ R, s ≥ 0,
and k ∈ N0 such that k + 12 < s. Then, the following spaces are equal:
s
i) H(k)
(Ξ), the space of all u ∈ H s (Ξ) such that the traces of ∂νi u for 0 ≤ i ≤ k vanish on ∂Ξ;
k·kH s (Ξ)

, the closure in the H s (Ξ)-norm of the set of all funcii) u ∈ C ∞ (Ξ) : ∂νi u = 0 on ∂Ξ ∀i ≤ k
∞
tions in C (Ξ) whose derivatives up to order k vanish on ∂Ξ;
min(k+1,s)
iii) H s (Ξ) ∩ H0
(Ξ).

Remark A.2. This result actually holds in far more generality (with basically the same proof): on the one
hand one can replace the condition ∂νi u = 0 for 0 ≤ i ≤ k by the more general condition ∂νi u = 0 for i ∈ K,
where K ⊂ N, as long as s − 12 ∈
/ K. On the other hand one can take Ξ to be any domain with Lipschitz
boundary. The only additional diﬃculty then is to deﬁne ∂νi u in view of the fact that ν is in general only a
measurable function. However if one deﬁnes ∂νi u as the appropriate linear combination of the traces of ∂ α u
for |α| = i (cf. [MM13, p. 156]) the results still hold.
Proof of Lemma A.1. As was already remarked in Section 1.3, for the Lipschitz domain Ξ, every function in
Cc∞ (Ξ) is the restriction of a function in Cc∞ (Rn ) to Ξ. In particular, we have that Cc∞ (Ξ) ⊂ H s (Ξ).
We will prove the inclusions

This follows from general theory (e.g. [MM13, Theorem 3.18]),
 but it is also easy to verify by direct
calculations: we need to check that we can approximate any v ∈ u ∈ Cc∞ (Ξ) : ∂νi u = 0 on ∂Ξ ∀i ≤ k with
Cc∞ (Ξ)-functions in the H min(k+1,s) -norm.
The proof of this assertion proceeds as follows. The assumptions on v imply that the extension v̄ of v
by 0 to Rn is in C k (Rn ). In addition, v̄ ∈ H k+1 (Rn ). To verify this one can use that all derivatives of
v of order k are continuous, have zero trace, and are in H 1 (Ξ). Hence, their extensions by zero belong to
H 1 (Rn ). This is well known for general Lipschitz domains (and is easily seen by a partition of unity argument
and transformation to the half-space situation by composition with a bi-Lipschitz map). Now dilation is
continuous in H k+1 (Rn ), and hence v can be approximated by H0k+1 (Ξ) functions in the H k+1 norm. Thus,
v ∈ H0k+1 (Ξ). Consequently, v can be approximated in the k · kH k+1 norm, and in particular in the possibly
weaker norm k · kH min(s,k+1) by Cc∞ (Ξ) functions.
It remains to prove (A.3). We ﬁrst observe that

To see this we apply the criterion of Burenkov [Bur98, Theorem 2 on p. 49]. The ﬁrst three assumptions of

Appendix B. Remarks on Interpolation
In this section we shall collect and discuss various results on interpolation spaces that were used in our
work. As we only consider Hilbert spaces, we do not need the theory of interpolation spaces in its full
generality and can make some simpliﬁcations.
We consider two separable Hilbert spaces X and Y such that X ⊂ Y is dense and the injection is
continuous. Then, given θ ∈ [0, 1], we can consider the associated interpolation spaces [X, Y ]θ := D(Λ1−θ )
equipped with the graph norm, where Λ is a self-adjoint positive operator on Y with domain X (see [LM72a,
Section 2] for details, starting with the nontrivial fact that such a Λ always exists). Because we are considering
Hilbert spaces, this deﬁnition yields up to equivalence of norms the same space as the complex interpolation
space [X, Y ][θ] or the real interpolation space [X, Y ]θ,2 (see [LM72a, Section 14.2 and Section 15] for proofs).
Thus we will be able to freely use results for either of these interpolation techniques from the literature.
s
Our ﬁrst task is to study whether the spaces H(k)
(Ξ) form an interpolation scale, where Ξ ⊂ Rn is open
and connected. If Ξ has a smooth boundary this was shown in [Gri67] with an alternative proof in [Löf92].
However we are interested in the cases Ξ = (0, 1)n or Ξ = (0, ∞)n , and the two aforementioned proofs do not
easily extend to that case. On the other hand, if Ξ has Lipschitz boundary then there are results concerning
the interpolation scales H s (Ξ) and H0s (Ξ) (see e.g. [Bra95]), but not for our mixed case.
Fortunately, in our case it is possible to use the fact that our domain is a cartesian product in combination
with results from [LM72a] to give a proof of the desired result by induction on the dimension.
We begin by stating a one-dimensional but vector-valued result that we will need in the proof of the
s
following lemmas. In addition to the notation from the Introduction, we deﬁne H#
(I), where I ⊂ R is an
open interval such that 0 ∈ I, as the closure of the linear space of functions u contained in C ∞ (I) ∩ H s (I)
with u′ (0) = 0 in the k · kH s -norm.
Lemma B.1. Let E be a separable Hilbert space, I ⊂ R a (possibly unbounded) open interval, and k ∈ N.
Let s ≥ t ≥ 1, and let θ ∈ (0, 1). If s − 12 ∈
/ {0, 1, . . . , k} and (1 − θ)s − 21 ∈
/ {0, 1, . . . , k}, then we have that

from a simple general tensorization argument, see Lemma B.2 below.
For (B.2) it suﬃces again to consider the case E = R. The inclusion “⊂” is straightforward. For the

kak2[X⊗E,Y ⊗E]θ ≤ 2S ≤ 2(1 + δ)2 kak2[X,Y ]θ ⊗E .

Now we can establish the desired interpolation results in higher dimensions. For the following lemma, we
are interested in the cases Ξ = Ω and k = 1 or Ξ = (0, ∞)n and k = 0.
Lemma B.3. Let Ξ = I1 × · · · × In , where Ij ⊂ R are (possibly unbounded) open intervals. Let K =
{k1 , . . . , km } ⊂ N0 . Let s ≥ t ≥ 0, and let θ ∈ [0, 1]. If none of s − 21 , t − 21 and (1 − θ)s + θt − 12 are in

Proof. The identity (B.3) immediately follows from (B.4) and reiteration, so it suﬃces to establish (B.4).
We proceed by induction on n. The case n = 1 was established in Lemma B.1. Now assume that the
theorem holds for n − 1 dimensions. The following argument is similar to the one in Section 2.1 in [LM72b].
Let Ξ′ = I1 × · · · × In−1 , and write x = (x′ , xn ). If we interpret a function Ξ → R as a function
In → (Ξ′ → R), we claim that
(B.5)

L2 (Ξ) = L2 (In , L2 (Ξ′ ))

and
(B.6)

s

s
H(k)
(Ξ) = L2 (In , H(k)

(In , L2 (Ξ′ )).

Indeed, (B.5) is obvious. For (B.6) one can argue as follows. It is well-known (and can be proved using the
Fourier transform, for example,) that
(B.7)

H s (Rn ) = L2 (R, H s (Rn−1 )) ∩ H s (R, L2 (Rn−1 )).

22

STEFAN MÜLLER, FLORIAN SCHWEIGER, AND ENDRE SÜLI

The sets Ξ′ and In have Lipschitz boundary, and so there exists an extension operator E, mapping H t (Ξ)
continuously to H t (Rn ) for t ∈ {0, s}, that also maps H t (Ξ′ × {xn }) continuously to H t (Rn−1 × {xn }) for
any xn ∈ In . One can construct such an E by ﬁrst applying an appropriate extension operator on each slice
Ξ′ × {xn } ⊂ Rn−1 × {xn } and then extending in the direction en . Using this extension operator, one can
easily check that (B.7) implies also that
H s (Ξ) = L2 (In , H s (Ξ′ )) ∩ H s (In , L2 (Ξ′ )).

From this we want to deduce (B.6) by considering the faces of Ξ separately. We begin with “⊂” in (B.6).
s
Let u ∈ H(k)
(Ξ), and take j ≤ n − 1. Let Ξ′j,± × In be the two faces of Ξ orthogonal to ej . By assumption
the trace of ∂ji u for i ≤ k vanishes on Ξ′j,± × In as an element of H s−j−1/2 (Ξ′j,± × In ) and thus also as
an element of L2 (In , H s−j−1/2 (Ξ′j,± ). In particular, for almost every xn the trace of ∂ji u(·, xn ) vanishes on
s
Ξ′j,± × {xn }. This holds for all j ≤ n − 1 and all i ≤ k, and so u ∈ L2 (In , H(k)
(Ξ′ )). We can argue similarly
s
2
′
for the case j = n to deduce that u ∈ H(k) (In , L (Ξ )) and have thus shown “⊂” in (B.6). The argument for
“⊃” is analogous. Thus we have established (B.6).
s
Now L2 (In , H(k)
(Ξ′ )) is the domain of an unbounded positive operator Λ1 on L2 (In , L2 (Ξ′ )), and Λ1 is
′
s
an operator in x , independent of xn . Similarly, H(k)
(In , L2 (Ξ′ )) is the domain of an unbounded positive
operator Λ2 on L2 (In , L2 (Ξ′ )), and Λ2 is an operator in x′ , independent of xn . In particular, Λ1 and Λ2
commute. Thus we can apply the criterion for the interpolation space of an intersection [LM72a, Theorem
13.1] and obtain that
