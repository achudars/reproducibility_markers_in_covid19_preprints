The crystal lattice of Sr2 IrO4 is investigated with synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction under
hydrostatic pressures up to P = 43 GPa and temperatures down to 20 K. The tetragonal unit cell
is maintained over the whole investigated pressure range, within our resolution and sensitivity. The
c-axis compressibility κc (P, T ) ≡ −(1/c)(dc/dP ) presents an anomaly with pressure at P1 = 17
GPa at fixed T = 20 K that is not observed at T = 300 K, whereas κa (P, T ) is nearly temperatureindependent and shows a linear behavior with P . The anomaly in κc (P, T ) is associated with the
onset of long-range magnetic order, as evidenced by an analysis of the temperature-dependence of
the lattice parameters at fixed P = 13.7 ± 0.5 GPa. At fixed T = 20 K, the tetragonal elongation
c/a(P, T ) shows a gradual increment with pressure and a depletion above P2 = 30 GPa that indicates
an orbital transition and possibly marks the collapse of the Jef f = 1/2 spin-orbit-entangled state.
Our results support pressure-induced phase transitions or crossovers between electronic ground
states that are sensed, and therefore can be probed, by the crystal lattice at low temperatures in
this prototype spin-orbit Mott insulator.

INTRODUCTION

The effect of strong spin-orbit coupling in the physical properties of solids is an active area of research in
contemporary condensed matter physics 1–4. The 5dtransition metal oxides, in particular the RuddlesdenPopper series of strontium iridates Srn+1 Irn O3n+1 , are
of interest due to the rare combination of strong spinorbit interaction and electronic correlations that leads to
a spin-orbit-entangled Mott insulating state (Jef f = 1/2)
5–10. According to powder diffraction experiments, the
layered crystal structure of Sr2 IrO4 (n = 1) can be well
described under a tetragonal space group I41 /acd, featuring a rotation of the IrO6 octahedra by ∼ 11◦ along
the c-axis 11, 12. A significant Dzyaloshinskii-Moriyatype (DM) antisymmetric exchange interaction leads to
a canted magnetic structure with a weak ferromagnetic
moment of 0.06 − 0.14 µB /Ir below TN = 240 K at ambient pressure 12–14. The in-plane magnetic canting angle
is nearly locked to the octahedral rotation 5, 6, 15, 16.
On the other hand, the Jef f = 1/2 state state may be
unstable against a slight distortion of the IrO6 octahedra
due to possible competing orbital configurations 16, 17.
Application of external pressure is expected to induce
changes in the interatomic distances and angles, which
could tune such competing electronic ground states. It is
also generally expected that external pressure should favor a metallic against a Mott insulating state, since the
compressed lattice should increase the hybridization of
the atomic wavefunctions thereby increasing the bandwidths. However, a metallic state is not achieved up
to at least 55 GPa in Sr2 IrO4 , and the resistivity displays a U-shaped curve with pressure 18–20. Our recent
combined synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction (XPD)
and phonon Raman scattering study under pressure at

pressures at T = 20 K (λ = 0.61986 Å). The Miller indices of
selected reflections are indicated.

room temperature revealed a first-order structural phase
transition at ∼ 50 GPa, and anomalous phonon and lattice behavior below 40 GPa that are indicative of electronic instabilities 21. On the other hand, it is desirable to extend the detailed crystallographic investigation
of this system under pressure to the low-temperature
region of the phase diagram, so the relevance of the
electronic/magnetic ground states to the crystal lattice
can be probed. Here, we report a detailed XPD study
in Sr2 IrO4 under hydrostatic pressures up to P = 43
GPa and down to T = 20 K. The long-range magnetic
order is shown to produce an increment of the c-axis
compressibility κc (P, T ) ≡ −(1/c)(dc/dP ), as revealed
both by pressure-dependence (at low temperature) and

temperature-dependence (at P = 13.7 ± 0.5 GPa) of the
lattice parameters. Also, the c/a ratio shows a depletion consistent with an orbital transition above P2 = 30
GPa. Our results demonstrate that pressure-induced
changes in the electronic and/or magnetic ground state
of Sr2 IrO4 have a measurable impact in the crystal lattice at low temperatures, and, conversely, such lattice
anomalies can be used to investigate the nature of the
electronic/magnetic transitions of this and related materials.
EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

The Sr2 IrO4 powder sample was synthesized by standard high-temperature solid-state reaction mechanism as
described in Ref. 21. Pressure-dependent XPD measurements at low temperature were carried out at the
X-ray Diffraction and Spectroscopy (XDS) beamline of
the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS) 22
with λ = 0.61986 Å calibrated with a LaB6 standard
sample. The focal spot size is 90 × 40 µm2 , obtained
with a Rh cylindrical mirror, a LN2 -cooled double flat
Si(111) crystal monochromator, a Rh toroidal focusing
mirror, and a Kirkpatrick-Baez mirror. The diffracted
Debye rings were detected in transmission geometry by

a 2D-detector and the ring intensities were integrated to
yield conventional I versus 2θ diffractograms. A CuBe
diamond anvil cell (DAC) was placed inside a continuousflow liquid He cryostat. Boehler-Almax-type ultralow
fluorescence diamonds with a cullet diameter of 350 µm
were used to generate pressure. The pressure transmitting medium was helium, and gaskets were made of rhenium. The pressure values were obtained using the wellknown ruby R1 fluorescence lineshift method. Pressure
inside the DAC was controlled using a gas membrane.
The pressure-dependent measurements were taken under increasing pressurization after the target temperature
was stabilized. Temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction
data at fixed pressure (13.7 ± 0.5 GPa) were collected
under warming after cooling the cell with residual pressure (< 5 GPa) and applying the desired pressure at
the base temperature. The target pressure was checked
at each temperature. For each measurement run (either
pressure- or temperature-dependent), a new virgin sample was loaded in the pressure cell.

tent with a tetragonal space group I41 /acd are observed
in this pressure range, within our resolution and sensitivity. Rietveld refinements were performed in order to
extract the lattice parameters of this phase under pressure. Since the accuracy of the Bragg intensities was
limited by poor grain statistics (see ref. 21) and possible preferred orientation effects, the atomic positions and
Debye Waller factors were kept fixed in the refinements
at previously reported values at zero pressure (Ref. 12).
Figure 2 shows the full observed and calculated diffrac-

tion profiles at selected pressures, revealing sufficiently
good fits that led to reliable refined lattice parameters.
The pressure-dependence of the a and c latice parameters at 20 K are shown in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), respectively. The corresponding unit cell volume V is given
in Fig. 3(c) (symbols). A Murnaghan equation of state
0
23 P = (B0 /B00 )[(V0 /V (P ))B0 − 1]) yielded a satisfatory
fit (solid line in Fig. 3(c)), with the initial bulk modulus B0 = 162(3) GPa, initial bulk modulus derivative
B00 = 3.6(2) and initial unit cell volume V0 = 777.0(8)
Å3 . The tetragonal elongation (c/a ratio) is given in Fig.
3(d), increasing under pressurization. A clear anomaly
in the c/a curve is seen at P2 = 30 GPa.
Figures 4(a) and 4(b) show the a- and c-axes compressibilities κa (P ) and κc (P ) obtained from the refined
lattice parameters at (a) 20 K and (b) room temperature,
respectively, where the latter was extracted from the data
shown Ref. 21. It can be seen that the κa (P ) curve is
similar at both temperatures, showing a smooth reduction under increasing pressures, whereas κc (P ) is sensitive to temperature. In fact, at 20 K, κc (P ) decreases
from 1.7(1) × 10−3 GPa−1 at 7 GPa to 1.0(1) × 10−3

DISCUSSION

FIG. 5: Temperature-dependence of the tetragonal elongation (c/a ratio) on warming under constant P = 13.7 ± 0.5
GPa.

GPa−1 at P1 ≡ 17 GPa, remaining nearly constant at this
value up to P2 ≡ 30 GPa and further decreasing at higher
pressures. At room temperature, κc (P ) increases slightly
from 1.2(1) × 10−3 GPa−1 at 7 GPa to 1.6(1) × 10−3
GPa−1 at P1 , then decreasing to 1.0(1) × 10−3 GPa−1 at
P2 and steeply approaching to zero at higher pressures.
In order to investigate whether the different κc (P )
curves at T = 20 K and T = 300 K may be related to a phase transition, more detailed temperaturedependent measurements are necessary. Since ∆c(P ) =
RP
− 0 κc (P 0 )dP 0 , the increased c-axis compressibility at
low temperatures and low pressures would be consistent
with a larger integrated c-axis compression −∆c(P ) at
20 K with respect to room T in the low-pressure limit.
In order to further investigate this effect, we obtained
the temperature-dependence of the lattice parameters on
warming while keeping a nearly constant applied pressure 13.7 ± 0.5 GPa. Whereas the slight pressure variations for each change of temperature are sufficient to
induce significant non-statistical fluctuations for both a
and c (not shown), the c/a ratio is much less sensitive
to such pressure variations, yielding a physically meaningful temperature-dependence (see Fig. 5). This ratio
decreases steady on warming up to ∼ 115 K, shows a significant increment above this temperature, and finally
stabilizes at a constant value c/a = 4.725 above 130
K. Considering that κa (P ) is temperature-independent
within our resolution, the increment of c/a(P = 13.7
GPa) above 115 K shown in Fig. 5 is consistent with the
larger κc (P ) at low temperatures and low pressures with
respect to room temperature and low pressures (see Fig.
4).

The κc (P ) curves displayed in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) indicate a change of behavior at P1 = 17 GPa. Also, a clear
anomaly in the c/a ratio is observed at P2 = 30 GPa (see
Fig. 3(d)). Previous Raman scattering data at room
temperature show significant phonon anomalies at both
P1 and P2 (Ref. 21). Also, the magnetic XMCD signal
and antiferromagnetic diffraction peaks at low temperatures disappear at P1 , whereas the XAS L3 /L2 branching ratio appears to show a significant reduction above
P2 (Refs. 19 and 24). Taking all these independent data
into consideration, there is compelling evidence of phase
transitions or crossovers at these critical pressures, which
are manifested at room temperature as well as at low
temperatures. In short, the observed pressure-induced
anomalies in the crystal lattice are likely related to modifications in the electronic structure of this material.
It can be seen in Figs. 3 and 4 that the lattice compression is anisotropic, consistent with previous data 19, 21.
In fact, since κa > κc for all pressures, the tetragonal
elongation c/a increases with P [see Fig. 4(d)]. This is a
reasonable trend, since the compression in the ab-plane
may occur both by a reduction of bond distances and
by an increment of the tilt angle of the IrO6 octahedra
along the c-axis, whereas only the first of these mechanisms is operative for the c-axis compression. Up to P2 ,
the increment of c/a ratio is well captured by a secondorder polynomial [dashed line in Fig. 4(d)]. However,
above P2 the c/a ratio clearly falls below the extrapolated polynomical behavior. For pressures significantly
above P2 , this ratio appears to restablish the same increment rate as the extrapolated polynomial, however with
a constant negative offset. This behavior is suggestive of
an orbital transition at P2 with an increment of Ir 5d electronic density in the ab plane above this pressure. Since
the 5d electronic density in the ideal spin-orbit-entangled
Jef f = 1/2 state shows cubic symmetry with equal xy,
xz and yz orbital occupations, the reported anomaly in
the c/a ratio at P2 is indicative of a breakdown of such
state. A possible scenario that is consistent with our data
is a transition from a Jef f = 1/2 state at low pressures
to a state with fully occupied xy orbitals and a hole in
a combination of xz and yz orbitals above P2 . In fact,
ab-initio electronic calculations indicate that such state
may be energetically viable with repect to the Jef f = 1/2
configuration 17.
The structural anomaly observed at P1 appears to be
more subtle with respect to that at P2 . In fact, no clear
jump is observed in c/a, suggesting that Ir4+ orbital configuration is not substantially altered at P1 . This is consistent with the nearly constant L3 /L2 XAS branching
ratio through P1 19. On the other hand, κc shows a
clear change of behavior at P1 and low temperatures (see
Fig. 4(a)). Our temperature-dependent lattice compres-

5
sion data at P = 13.7 GPa indicates that the increased
compressibility at low pressures is related to a phase transition that occurs at T ∗ ∼ 115−130 K (see Fig. 5), which
coincides with TN for this pressure (see Ref. 24). It is
therefore clear that the increment of κc at low pressures
and low temperatures is associated with the presence of
long-range magnetic order under these conditions. It is
interesting to mention that the reduction of c/a below T ∗
at P = 13.7 GPa contrasts with the behavior at ambient
pressure, where c/a increases below Tc (Ref. 25). Therefore, the anomalies in c/a shown in Fig. 5 most likely
reflect the increment in κc in the magnetically ordered
phase rather than a magnetoelastic coupling at zero pressure.

CONCLUSIONS

In summary, the lattice parameters of pressurized
Sr2 IrO4 shows a tetragonal elongation that is increased
significantly by hydrostatic pressures of the order of tens
of GPa, with anomalies in κc at P1 = 17 GPa at low temperatures and c/a ratio at P2 = 30 GPa. The anomaly at
P2 is interpreted in terms of a transition between competing orbital configurations of the Ir 5d t2g hole, whereas
the anomaly of κc at P1 is associated with the onset of
long-range magnetic order.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

It is not very surprising that the lattice compressibility is sensitive to magnetic order. In fact, the magnetic
energy may modify the lattice spring constants directly
through the spin-phonon coupling [26–28], whereas less
direct mechanisms involving the coupling of magnetic order to the electronic structure through the spin-orbit coupling might also affect the lattice stiffness. However, the
sensitivity of κc but not κa to long-range magnetic order
is interesting, considering that the exchange coupling in
the ab plane is much stronger than along c. This result
is likely a consequence of the much larger magnetic correlation length within the ab plane than along c in the
paramagnetic phase of this material 29, which may effectively wash out the sensitivity of κa to the long-range
magnetic ordering transition.
Finally, we should mention that anisotropic lineshape
broadenings of Bragg peaks were previously reported at
room temperature and for P > P1 21, which was interpreted as a possible sign of a symmetry-breaking instability. This line of reasoning led to the expectation that the
crystal structure should suffer a long-range phase transition at P1 for sufficiently low temperatures, which is
however not confirmed by our present data at least at
T = 20 K. An alternative explanation for the anisotropic
lineshape broadenings reported in ref. 21 is based on the
anisotropic compressibility of the crystal structure (see
Fig. 4). Spatial fluctuations of the stress may occur
and become more pronounced as the applied pressure
increases. This may result in anisotropic strain fluctuations due to the different values of κa and κc , therefore leading to the anisotropic lineshape broadenings of
the Bragg peaks. On the other hand, it is interesting
to note that for Sr3 Ir2 O7 , which is another member of
this Ruddlesden-Popper series with n = 2, a tetragonalmonoclinic transition was observed at pressures close to
15 GPa 30, which is comparable to the critical pressure
P1 for Sr2 IrO4 . Further investigations are necessary to
explore the similarities and differences between these related materials.
