Abstract. A family of exponential martingales of a stochastic Laplacian growth problem is
proposed. Stochastic Laplacian growth describes a regularized interface dynamics in a twofluid system, where the viscous fluid is incompressible at a large scale, while compressible
at a small scale in the vicinity of the interface. Hence, random fluctuations of pressure
near the boundary are inevitable. By using Loewner-Kufarev equation, we study interface
dynamics generated by nonlocal random Loewner measure, which produces the patterns
with viscous fingers. We use a Schottky double construction to introduce a one-parametric
family of functions of random processes on the double closely connected to the correlation
functions of primary operators of the boundary conformal field theory in the Coulomb gas
framework. For a specific value of the parameter, these functions are martingales with respect
to stochastic Loewner flow on the Schottky double. A connection between the proposed
algebraic construction and the physical problem of stochastic interface dynamics relies on the
Hadamard’s variational formula. Namely, the variation of pressure in stochastic Laplacian
growth near the interface is given by the covariance of martingales on the double.

1. Introduction
Loewner approach of studying increasing families of plane compact sets is an important
tool in complex analysis since 1920’s. This approach allows one to parametrize families of
conformal mappings of references domain, e.g., the upper half plane or the unit disk, in terms
of real-valued functions on the real line or the unit circle. The Schramm-Loewner evolution
(SLE) proposed by Oded Schramm in the early 2000’s generalizes the original Loewner method
to the case of growing random fractal curves in the plane domain that satisfy conformal
invariance and domain Markov property [Sch00]. From the physical point of view SLE curves
describe interfaces in the continuum limits of various lattice models of statistical mechanics,
such as the boundaries of spin clusters in the Ising and Potts models, percolation paths, etc.
A more general family of fractals are generated in nonlocal processes, where the growth
takes place at multiple points of the interface simultaneously. These processes can be studied
by the generalized version of Loewner equation, called Loewner-Kufarev equation [Kuf43].
In this equation, the driving function is replaced by the driving measure on the real line or
the unit circle. An important example of nonlocal deterministic growth process is Laplacian
growth (LG) or the Hele-Shaw problem (see Ref. [BKL+ 86] for a review). This diffusiondriven growth process embraces numerous free boundary dynamics including bidirectional
solidification, dendrite formation, electrodeposition, dielectric breakdown, bacterial growth,
and flows in porous media [PL88]. LG stands out against the other nonlocal growth processes,
because of its powerful properties, unusual for most nonlinear growth processes, such as
infinitely many conservation laws [Ric72] and closed form exact solutions [SB84]. A new splash
of interest to LG was provoked by establishing strong connections of the interface dynamics
to major integrable hierarchies, and the theory of random matrices [MWWZ00, KKMW+ 01].

LG is characterized by the finger-like unstable patterns featuring the formation of cusps
at the boundary in a finite time [SB84]. Hence, the problem is ill defined, and a certain
regularization is required. The conventional hydrodynamical regularization is realized through
a surface tension, when pressure along the interface is proportional to its curvature. The
universal fractal structures are observed in the zero-surface-tension limit. However, surface
tension is a singular perturbation of the model, i.e., it has a profound effect upon the evolution
of the interface. Hence, the zero-surface-tension limit of the LG problem is rather tricky.
Fortunately, there exist alternative methods for regularizing the problem. Probably, the best
known are various random walk models of the Hele-Shaw behavior.
In this paper we consider stochastic LG, which describes nonsingular diffusion driven stochastic interface dynamics in the Hele-Shaw cell. A discrete model, which underlies this
process, is based on the random walk model of the LG problem, namely, diffusion-limited
aggregation (DLA) [WS81]. DLA is a process where equal particles with a small size ~ are
issued one by one from a distant source. These particles diffuse as random walkers until hit
the domain and stick to it. Numerical simulations of DLA show the formation of branching
graphs with a width controlled by the size of the particle ~. The typical aggregates take ramified shapes, and develop branches and fjords of various scales. Remarkably, however, that all
grown clusters appear to be monofractals with the numerically obtained Hausdorff dimension
DH = 1.71 ± 0.01, which appears to be robust and universal [Hal00]. DLA is believed to provide a discrete variant of LG, where the particle size, ~, plays a role of a short-distance cutoff
regularizing singularities emerging in fluid dynamics. The relation of stochastic (DLA) and
deterministic (LG) processes remains unclear (see, however, Refs. [HL98, CM01]). A natural
way to proceed is to consider the continuum limit of stochastic growth, which appears to be
non-trivial. It can be anticipated that the DLA dynamics is equivalent to Laplacian contour
dynamics, where the finite-time singularities are resolved on microscale due to noise.
Recently, it was proposed, that LG and DLA can be unified as two opposite limits of
a discrete stochastic LG model [AMW16]. In this model the distant source emits K ≥ 1
uncorrelated particles per time unit. However, no motion of the interface occurs until all of
them hit the boundary. The advance of the interface along the unit normal vector is then
proportional to the number of particles, which hit the given portion of the boundary. Although
the continuum limit of this discrete process is not rigorously obtained yet, a physical intuition
based on statistical mechanics arguments allows one to introduce a continuum analog of this
model [Ale17, Ale19a, Ale19b].
In this work we continue to study stochastic LG in the continuum framework. The model
is described by Loewner-Kufarev equation with a random Loewner measure. It possesses a
family of martingales [Ale19b] closely connected to certain correlation functions of conformal
field theory (CFT) [BPZ84, FMS97]. Let us briefly recall the basic arguments. One can
couple various lattice models of statistical mechanics (described by CFTs at critical points
in the continuum limit) to any planar domains. The Loewner chain generates a sequence
of conformal transformations of the domain, which act in the Hilbert space of CFTs by
the Virasoro algebra spanned by the generators Ln , n ∈ Z, with the commutation relations
[Ln , Lm ] = (n − m)Ln+m + (c/12)(m3 − m)δm+n,0 , where the real constant c is the central
charge. The Verma modules Vc,h with the highest weights h, form the highest weight representation of the algebra. The Verma module, Vc,h , can be reducible for certain values of c and
h, because it may contain the so-called null vectors, i.e., the states in the module, |χi ∈ Vc,h ,
that are both primary and descendant, i.e., Ln |χi = 0 for n > 0. The relevant example is the

null vector at the second level. Requiring the decoupling of the null vector from every correlation function leads to the second order differential equation for the correlation functions
containing the highest weight vector of the degenerate module.
Remarkably, the same second order differential equation also arises when considering stochastic dynamics of interfaces in the plane. The best known example is SLE, where this
equation appears as the necessary condition for certain functions of random processes to be
martingales. Therefore, it is natural to expect, that the null vector constraint for CFT coupled
to the LG problem can be also related to certain martingales of the interface dynamics.
Below, we will try to avoid any application of CFT technique, and study stochastic LG by
the conventional methods of stochastic calculus. The only nontrivial algebraic construction
we used below is a Schottky double of the domain complementary to the growing cluster.
Note, that this construction has already been appeared in the context of deterministic LG
problem [Gus83, KMWWZ04]. One can show, that the interface dynamics in the LG problem
can be considered as an evolution of a certain curve on the Schottky double. As will be detailed
shortly, the martingales are random processes on the double associated with this stochastic
dynamics. A direct connection between the proposed martingales and stochastic LG problem
relies on Hadamard’s variational formula for the Green’s function of the Dirichlet boundary
problem. We will show, that the variation of pressure near the interface can be written in
terms of the covariance of the martingales on the Schottky double.
The article is organized as follows. Section 2 recalls necessary background on Loewner
chains, and both deterministic and stochastic LG problems of simply connected planar domains. We also recall a relation between LG and the Dirichlet boundary problem. This helps
to introduce Hadamard’s formula for the variation of the Dirichlet Green’s function under
smooth deformations of the domain in the stochastic LG problem. Section 3 is devoted to
martingales of stochastic LG. We consider the Schottky double of the domain complementary
to the growing cluster, and define a Loewner flow on the double by continuously continuing
the flow from the one side of the double to another across the interface. Then, we introduce a
one-parametric family of exponential functions of random processes on the Schottky double,
and study their variation with respect to the stochastic flow. For specific value of the parameter, these functions are shown to be the martingales of stochastic Loewner flow. Finally, in
Section 4 we draw our conclusion and discuss some open problems.
2. Laplacian growth
2.1. Loewner chains. Let us consider a continuously decreasing set of simply connected
planar domains, Dt , 0 ≤ t < ∞, and refer to the continuous label t as to time. By the
Riemann mapping theorem there exist conformal maps zt : D → Dt from the exterior of the
unit disk, D, in the auxiliary w plane to the domains Dt in the physical z plane (see Fig. 1).
In order to make the map unique, one imposes the constraints: zt (∞) = ∞, and zt0 (∞) = rt is
a real-valued positive function of time called conformal radius 1. A family of functions (zt )t≥0
is called a Loewner chain. The Loewner equation describes the evolution of the Loewner
chain (zt )t≥0 with time by the following partial integro-differential equation:

Figure 1. The conformal map z = zt (w) from the exterior of the unit disk
D in the auxiliary w plane to the exterior of the growing cluster Dt in the z
plane. The map is normalized as follows: zt (∞) = ∞, and zt0 (∞) = rt , where
the conformal radius, rt , is a real-valued function of time t.
where the function pt (w) is measurable for t ≥ 0 for all w ∈ D, holomorphic in w ∈ D, and
has the negative real part, Re pt (w) < 0 for w ∈ ∂D. It can be written as follows:
Z 2π
dφ eiφ + w
(2)
pt (w) =
ρt (eiφ ),
2π eiφ − w
0
where the Loewner density, ρt (w), is a real-valued positive function on the unit circle, which
drives the time evolution of the chain. Given the initial condition, z0 (w) = w, the LoewnerKufarev equation admits an unique solution. Note, that the function pt (w) has a jump across
the unit circle:
(3)

pt (w) = Re pt (w) + i Im pt (w),

pt (1/w̄) = − Re pt (w) + i Im pt (w),

provided w = lim→0 (1 + )eiθ .
The Loewner density determines the normal velocity of the contour ∂Dt with respect to the
time evolution generated by Loewner-Kufarev equation (1). Indeed, the unit complex tangent
vector to the contour is τ = iwzt0 (w)/|zt0 (w)|, and the outer normal unit vector is n = −iτ .
Thus, by using Loewner equation (1), and taking into account that Re pt (u) = −ρt (u), u ∈ ∂D,
the normal interface velocity, vn (z) = Re[n̄∂t zt (w)], at z = zt (eiφ ) ∈ ∂Dt reads
(4)

vn (zt (eiφ )) = |zt0 (eiφ )|ρt (eiφ ).

Let us briefly mention some particular examples of Loewner chains studied in the literature. The most known example is Loewner evolution generated by a singular Dirac measure,
ρ(eiφ )dφ = δ(eiφ − eiφ0 )dφ, on the unit circle. Because of the locality of the measure, Loewner
evolution describes the growing curve in the exterior (interior) of the unit disk [Loe23]. In
the case when eiφ0 is a position of the Brownian particle, the random evolution of the curve
is known as the Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE) [Sch00]. The locality and continuity of
the Brownian motion implies the absence of branching of SLE curves.
Another natural examples rely on absolutely continuous measures. In these cases the
domain Dt grows at infinitely many points of the boundary simultaneously. In particular, if
the density is ρt (w) = |zt0 (w)|−2 , w ∈ ∂D, then the normal interface velocity (4) is proportional
to the harmonic measure of the boundary, vn (ζ) ∝ |wt0 (ζ)|. Hence, this case corresponds to
the so-called Hele-Shaw flow or the deterministic LG problem.

The harmonic measure is important in what follows. Thus, it is instructive to recall its
definition and basic properties (see Ref. [GM05] for detail). Let us consider a two-dimensional
Brownian motion (Bs )s≥0 starting from z ∈ D, and let T = T (D) be the first exit time.
Then, Bs converges to B̂s ∈ ∂Dt as s ↑ T , with limit B̂T distributed at ∂D. Then, the
harmonic measure, ωD (z, V ), in D from z of a given portion of the boundary V ∈ ∂D is
ωD (z, V ) = Pz [B̂T ∈ V ].
The harmonic measure is conformally invariant, i.e., ωD (z, V ) = ωD0 (f (z), f (V )), where
f : D → D0 . When ∂D is a Jordan curve, the harmonic measure has a density called a
Poisson kernel, HD (z, s), namely, ωD (z, |ds|) = HD (z, s)|ds|. In particular, when D is the
exterior of the unit disk, D, the Poisson kernel is
w + eiφ
,
|w| > 1.
w − eiφ
The conformal invariance of the harmonic measure gives the following transformation of the
Poisson kernel

(5)

(6)

HD (w, eiφ ) = Re

HD (z, s) = |f 0 (s)|HD0 (f (z), f (s)),

where f : D → D0 . Thus, if wt : Dt → D is the conformal map from Dt to the exterior of the
unit disk D, one can obtain an explicit expression for HDt (denoted by Ht below), namely,
(7)

Ht (z, s) = |wt0 (s)| Re

eiφ + ξ
,
eiφ − ξ

eiφ = wt (s), ξ = w̄t (z̄)−1 ,

where bar denotes complex conjugation f (z) = f¯(z̄).
Below, we consider mainly the inverse conformal map, wt : Dt → D, from the domain
Dt to the exterior of the unit disk, D, in the w plane normalized so that wt (∞) = ∞ and
wt0 (∞) = rt−1 . The Loewner-Kufarev equation for the inverse map can be obtained by using
the characteristic equation for (1):
dwt (z)
= pt (wt (z))wt (z).
dt
This equation describes the evolution of the contour in the w plane. Because Re pt (w) < 0,
the contour wt+dt (z), where z ∈ ∂Dt , lies inside the unit disk, i.e., the contour in the w plane
contracts to the origin with time.
It is instructive to recall basics facts about deterministic Hele-Shaw problem first. Afterwards, we will introduce a stochastic LG model in order to study regularized interface
dynamics in the Hele-Shaw cell.

2.2. Deterministic Laplacian growth. The physical formulation of deterministic LG is
deceptively simple. Let Dt+ be a simply connected domain occupied by inviscous fluid or gas
between two parallel close plates (Hele-Shaw cell). The inviscous fluid is surrounded by a
viscous fluid (oil) occupying the rest of the cell, Dt = C \ Dt+ . The viscous fluid is sucked out
the cell by several oil wells in Dt . The Navier-Stokes equation for a quasistatic motion of a
viscous fluid in the Hele-Shaw cell reduces to the Darcy’s law: the fluid velocity, v = −∇Pt ,
equals the pressure gradient (in scaled units), where Pt (z, z̄) is pressure in viscous fluid, and
z = x + iy, z̄ = x − iy are complex coordinates.
Because of incompressibility, ∇ · v = 0, pressure satisfies Laplace equation ∇2 Pt (z) = 0 in
Dt , except the points with sinks or sources of viscous fluid which provide growth. If to neglect

6

surface tension, Pt (z) = const at the interface z ∈ ∂Dt 2. In the case, when the only oil sink
is located at infinity, pressure is a harmonic function in Dt , which diverges logarithmically as
z → ∞. Thus, it is proportional to the Green’s function of the Dirichlet boundary problem,
Pt (z) = −(Q/2π)Gt (z, ∞), where Gt (z, s) is the Dirichlet Green’s function in Dt , and Q is
the rate of the source 3.
Recall, that the Green’s function Gt (z, s) in the domain Dt is uniquely determined by
the following properties: (a) The function Gt (z, s) − log |z − s| is symmetric, bounded, and
harmonic everywhere in Dt in both arguments; (b) Gt (z, s) = 0 if s ∈ ∂Dt . The Green’s
function can be written explicitly in terms of the uniformization map of the domain Dt . In
particular, by using the map wt : Dt → D, one obtains the Green’s function in Dt :
(9)

Gt (z, s) = log

wt (z) − wt (s)
1 − wt (z)wt (s)

.

Now, returning to the Hele-Shaw problem, and taking account of the kinematic identity,
which equates the normal interface velocity, vn (s), and the fluid normal velocity at s ∈ ∂Dt ,
one obtains vn (s) = −∂n Pt (s), where ∂n stands for the normal derivative with the unit normal
vector n pointing inside the domain Dt . Since Pt (z) ∝ Gt (z, ∞), from eq. (9) one determines
the normal velocity, vn (s) = (Q/2π) log |wt0 (s)|, of the interface. Hence, the idealized (without
surface tension) deterministic LG problem with the oil sink at infinity with the rate Q is similar
to the Loewner chain driven by the density [SB84]:
(10)

ρt (eiφ ) = (Q/2π)|zt0 (eiφ )|−2 .

One can show, that Loewner-Kufarev equation with density (10) is equivalent to the following
nonlinear partial differential equation:
h
i
(11)
Im ∂t z̄t (e−iφ )∂φ zt (eiφ ) = Q/2π.
This is a classical LG equation, which was intensely studied earlier.
Although the interface dynamics in the deterministic LG problem obeys nonlinear dissipative equation of motion (11), it is integrable. Namely, the problem possesses infinitely many
conservation laws [Ric72], and exact solutions can be obtained in a closed form [SB84]. However, the idealized deterministic LG is ill-posed: the interface develops cusp-like singularities
in a finite time [SB84]. Therefore, the problem needs to be regularized. One possibility is to
use a conventional hydrodynamical regularization realized through a surface tension. In this
case, the pressure at the interface is proportional to its curvature, P (s) = −χκ(s), s ∈ ∂Dt ,
where the constant χ is the coefficient of the surface tension, and the real-valued function κ(s)
is the curvature of the boundary.4. However, nonzero surface tension destroys a rich mathematical structure of idealized LG, and complicates the analytical analysis. This motivates us
to consider another possible regularizations of problem.
2Without loss of generality one can set P (z) = 0 at z ∈ ∂D .

2.3. Discrete stochastic Laplacian growth. In this section we briefly recall a model for
the regularized interface dynamics in the Hele-Shaw cell. The model is based on the stochastic
realization of the Darcy’s law, namely, diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) [WS81].
Discrete stochastic LG generalizes DLA in what follows. Instead of one particle per time
unit the distant source emits K ≥ 1 uncorrelated Brownian particles one-by-one. However,
no motion of the boundary occurs until all of them hit the interface. The advance of the
interface, δh(s), along the normal vector n(s) at the boundary point s ∈ ∂Dt per time unit
δt is determined by the number of particles, k(s), which hit the given arc of the boundary,
|ds|, times the linear size, ~1/2 , of the particle:
δh(s) = k(s)~1/2 ,

s ∈ ∂Dt .
H
The total number of newly aggregated particles equals ∂D k(s)|ds| = K.
Different outcomes of the aggregation process determine possible growth scenarios. When
K is large, all points of the interface advance simultaneously. Let vn (s) = δh(s)/δt be the
instantaneous normal velocity of the interface at s ∈ ∂Dt . Then, vn is a random variable with
a multinomial distribution [AMW16]. In the large K limit one can recast the multinomial
distribution into Dyson’s circular distribution of eigenvalues of random N × N matrices 5,
whose eigenvalues are proportional to instantaneous normal velocities of N infinitesimal arcs
of the boundary [Ale17]. Namely, various scenarios of the discrete stochastic LG obey the
Gibbs-Boltzmann statistics:

N X

P[vn ] ∝ exp 
vn (si ) log |wt (si ) − wt (sj )|vn (sj ) .

(12)

i=1 j=1

The variation of eq. (13) shows that P is maximal when the vn = v̂n , where v̂n (s) ∝ |wt0 (s)|,
s ∈ ∂Dt . As mentioned previously (see Section 2.2), this process is similar to idealized
deterministic LG driven by a single source at infinity.
Fluctuations of vn around v̂n are forbidden in idealized deterministic LG, because the
viscous fluid is incompressible. However, the discreteness of the aggregation process, and
the finite size of the particles
effectively lead to the two-fluid model compressible on the
√
microscale of the order ~ in the vicinity of the interface, while in the bulk ∇ · v = 0. These
fluctuations are a source of noise for the LG problem. In Ref. [Ale19a] we considered possible
time evolutions of the fluctuations and showed, that the formation of viscous fingers is an
intrinsic feature of the growth process.
2.4. Continuous stochastic Laplacian growth. We propose the following definition of
the stochastic LG model in the continuum limit (see Refs. [Ale19a, Ale19b] for details). It
can be represented as the Loewner chain (zt )t≥0 generated by the density

Figure 2. The Loewner chain (zt )t≥0 describes a family of conformal maps,
zt : D → Dt , from the complement of the unit disk D in the auxiliary w plane
to the domain Dt in the z plane. The map is normalized so that zt (∞) =

corresponding geometrical objects in both planes: the centerlines of fjords in
the z plane, and the branchcuts of zt (w) inside the unit disk in the w plane.

function. In stochastic LG the branchcuts γn (t) evolve with time, because the

In eq. (15) we introduced
pa set of driving processes, ξ = {ξ1 , ξ2 , . . . , ξN } ∈ D , and the
random function, W (q) = κ/2B(q), proportional to the standard Brownian motion B(q)
with the mean zero, E[W (q)] = 0 (where E is the expectation value), and covariance

(17)

Cov[W (q), W (q 0 )] = (κ/2) min(q, q 0 ).

It is assumed that the auxiliary times qn (t) in the right hand side of eq. (15) are connected
to time t by the following differential equation
(18)

dqn (t) = ν|wt0 (ζn0 )|2 dt.

The points ζn0 = z0 (1/ξ¯n0 ), n = 1, 2, . . . , N , are the constants of motion representing the
positions of the tips of N fjords in the long time asymptotic (see Ref. [Ale19b] for details).
Remark 1. Because of stochastic dynamics of the driving processes (15), the bottoms of the
fjords have universal fractals shapes (see Fig. 4). Hence, the ordinary derivative, wt0 (s), is not
well-defined, while the harmonic measure does. The curve ∂Dt can be covered by the disks
B(si , ε) of radius ε centered at the points si ∈ ∂Dt . Let p(si , r) = ω(∂Dt ∩ B(si , r)) be the
harmonic measure of the portion of the curve covered by B(si , r). One can define a subset
∂Dtα ⊂ ∂Dt , consisting of the points s ∈ ∂Dtα , such that p(s, r) ∼ (r/L)α , as r/L → 0, where
L is the diameter of Dt . Hence |wt0 (ζn0 )| in eq. (18) should be replaced by εαn in the vicinity of
fractal boundary, where εn is a distance between ζn0 and the interface. Then, dqn (t) ≈ νε2α

Remark 2. The function ZN is similar to the N -point correlation function of the vertex operators Vαn ,ᾱn (ξn , ξ¯n ) in the CFT framework [FMS97, DF84]. By substituting ZN to eq. (19)
one obtains gn = 0, so that the random processes (15) do not interact with each other. Note,
however, that the anzats for the functions gn (ξ, ξ̄) and ZN (ξ, ξ̄) was originally proposed for
the correlation functions of primary operators [Ale19b]. They differ form the correlation
function of vertex operators by insertions of the so-called screening operators. However, these
insertions do not change the conformal properties of the correlation functions. Hence, the
vertex operators can be used to study critical behavior of the correlation functions, relevant to multifractal analysis of the boundary. Another important advantage of (20) over the
full correlation functions of primary operators is that in the present case the martingales of
stochastic LG can be written in terms of elementary functions (see Proposition 1 below).
The initial condition for the Loewner-Kufarev equation (1) is z0 (w) = w, i.e., the domain
+
in the unit disk. In deterministic LG (11), the initial disk continues to stay as a disk
Dt=0
with a growing radius. Complex irregular shapes typically observed at t > 0 are explained
by tiny uncontrollable initial deviations from a perfect disk, growing because of instability of
the process. In stochastic LG the complex shapes are attributed to random fluctuations of
pressure, parametrized by the processes ξn (t) in eq. (14).
The ansatz for the driving processes (15) can by justified by statistical mechanics arguments [Ale19b]. Namely, by coupling a critical statistical system to Dt , and arguing that
certain quotients of correlation functions of the corresponding CFT should be martingales
with respect to stochastic Loewner chain with density (14), one can obtain a set of stochastic
differential equations for the processes ξn , n = 1, 2 . . . , N , consistent with the conformal symmetry of the statistical systems. From this point of view, the function ZN can be considered
as the multi-point correlation function of N degenerate (at the second level) fields in the
Coulomb gas representation. Although, we will not follow this point of view here, the CFT
interpretation provides a clue to the martingales of stochastic LG.
2.5. Local fluctuations of pressure in stochastic Laplacian growth. Formally, the
Loewner chain with density (14) is similar to the idealized deterministic LG with the oil sink

If ζn = const (n = 1, 2, . . . , N ) these points have a clear physical interpretation as the positions
of oil wells, which inject the oil into the Hele-Shaw cell with the rates νπαn . However,
stochastic dynamics of the driving processes (15) results in non-trivial evolution of the oil
wells with time. We briefly review the pattern formation in stochastic LG in Appendix A

(see Refs. [Ale19a, Ale19b] for details). Therefore, one can introduce the (scaled) effective
pressure field which drives the interface dynamics:
N

Pt (z, ζ) = σGt (z, ∞) −

(22)

where Gt is the Dirichlet Green’s function in Dt , defined in Section 2.2, the set of points
ζ = {ζ1 , ζ2 , . . . , ζN } ∈ Dt , so that ξn = w̄t (ζ̄n )−1 , n = 1, 2, . . . , N .
Note, that the only physical oil sink is located at infinity, while the sources at ζn ’s can be
referred to as the virtual sources [AMW16]. The expression for pressure (22) is valid in the
vicinity of the boundary of the domain, because the short-distance regularization suggested
by the aggregation model effectively leads to compressible fluid on a small scale of the order of
~ near the interface due to a finite size of the particles. In the bulk the fluid is incompressible,
and the pressure is Pt (z) = (Q/2π)Gt (z, ∞). Hence, the virtual sources parametrize local
fluctuations of pressure in the vicinity of the boundary of the domain.
The time evolution of the domain, Dt , generated by the Loewner equation (8), results in
the evolution of the Green’s function Gt in Dt with time. It can be determined by using
Hadamard’s formula, which gives the variation of the Green’s function under smooth deformations of the boundary of the domain. Let dh(s) = vn (s)dt be the thickness between the
curve ∂Dt and the deformed curve ∂Dt+dt counted along the unit normal vector n(s) pointing inside the domain Dt at the point s ∈ ∂Dt . Then, the variation of the Dirichlet Green’s
function reads:

dGt (z, z ) =

where ∂n Gt (z, s) denotes the normal derivative of the Green’s function on the boundary with
respect to the second variable, and the unit normal vector points inside the domain Dt .
Now, after recalling Hadamard’s variational formula for the Dirichlet Green’s function the
following Lemma can be proved:
Lemma 1. Let us consider the effective pressure field, Pt (s, ζ), at s ∈ ∂Dt . Then, the
variation of Pt (s, ζ) with respect to the infinitesimal deformation of the domain generated by
the Loewner chain with density (14) reads

∂n G = 2 Re(nG0 ), of the Green’s function:
(25)

∂n Gt (ζ, s) = −Ht (ζ, s),

where Ht is the Poisson kernel in Dt , which can be written explicitly in terms of the uniformization map (7). Because of eq. (4), Hadamard’s variational formula (23) for the Green’s

3. Martingales of stochastic Laplacian growth
3.1. Preliminaries. In this section we propose a family of local martingales closely connected
to the stochastic LG problem. Roughly speaking, the martingale, Mt , is a random process,
for which the conditional expectation value at the next time instant is equal to the present
value, E[Mtn+1 |Mtn , . . . , Mt1 ] = Mtn . Equivalently, one can show that martingales satisfy
stochastic differential equations without drift terms, dMt = ft (Mt )dBt .
The martingales turns out to be essential objects to study geometrical properties of various
two-dimensional fractal sets generated by Loewner chains. Although some martingales for
SLE can be obtained explicitly by means of stochastic calculus, the methods of conformal
field theory provide a conventional framework to study wide classes of martingales. The
connection between SLEs and CFTs relies on the interpretation of SLE curves as the level
lines of Gaussian free field, which, in turn, emerges as a continuum description of certain
discrete statistical systems. These two-dimensional systems at critical points6 are described
by conformal field theories.
Although we will not use CFT methods below, the conformal field theory provides a clue to
martingales of stochastic LG. Indeed, let us consider a boundary CFT in Dt , which is characterized by the set of scaling operators (primary fields) Φh,h̄ (z, z̄) constituting representations
of the Virasoro algebra. The set of conformal dimensions, (h, h̄), specifies the transformation
of the correlation functions with respect to conformal mappings, e.g.,
Y

(27)
h Φhi ,h̄i (zi , z̄i )iDt =
(wt0 (zi ))hi (w̄t0 (z̄i ))h̄i h Φhi ,h̄i (wt (zi ), w̄t (z̄i ))iD ,
i

i

i

where wt : Dt → D. In the chiral CFT on C the transformation law of correlation functions
completely factorizes into the variation with respect to the holomorphic coordinates zi , and
the variation with respect to the antiholomorphic coordinates z̄i . Thus, one can consider the
coordinates z and z̄ as formally independent.
The holomorphic and antiholomorphic sectors of CFT are no longer independent on the
manifolds with boundaries, because the permissible conformal transformations of both sectors
must obey certain boundary conditions. For the most conventional domains (either the unit
disk or the upper half-plane) the non-chiral N -point correlation functions can be obtained by
considering chiral 2N -point function on C restricted by certain conditions along the unit circle
of the real line. The procedure of extending the domain of the definition of the boundary
CFT naturally leads to the Schottky double construction [SS54]. A possible application of
the Schottky double for studying deterministic LG problem can be found in Refs. [Gus83,
KMWWZ04]. The procedure of doubling of Dt together with the analysis of Ref. [Ale19b]
implies that the martingales of stochastic LG should be the functions of random process on
the Schottky double of Dt . Below, we briefly recall some basic notions of the Schottky double
construction.
The Schottky double Σ̂ of a planar domain with boundary is a compact Riemann surface
without boundary endowed with an antiholomorpic involution j on Σ̂. In order to make a
Schottky double of the bounded domain Dt , we take a copy Dt∗ of Dt , attach Dt∗ to Dt along
6At the critical point the correlation length of the system diverges.

Figure 3. The two sides Dt and Dt∗ of the Schottky double Σ̂ (with the points
∞ and ∞∗ added) are glued together along the boundary ∂Dt . The points
at the boundary are invariant with respect to the antiholomorphic involution.
By the arrows with lines we show schematically the vector field of conformal
transformations on the Schottky double, generated by the Loewner flow on Dt
and its continuation on Dt∗ .
the boundary ∂Dt , and add the points at both infinities (∞, ∞∗ ), so that a compact Riemann
surface Σ̂ is obtained:
(28)

Σ̂ = Dt ∪ ∂Dt ∪ Dt∗ ,

Note, that the Schottky double Σ̂ of the disk Dt is a Riemann sphere. If z ∈ Dt is a
holomorphic coordinate on Dt , let z ∗ ∈ Dt∗ denotes the corresponding point on Dt∗ . The
involution j on Σ is defined by j(z) = z ∗ , j(z ∗ ) = z, and j(z) = z for z ∈ ∂Dt . The
conformal structure on Dt can be extended across ∂Dt to a conformal structure on all of Σ.
The conformal structure on Dt∗ is the opposite to that on Dt . Hence, the function z ∗ → z̄
can be considered as a local coordinate on Dt∗ .
Remark 3. Below, we use the notations z ∗ and z̄, where z̄ always refers to the complex
conjugate of z, while z ∗ is treated as an independent coordinate of the antiholomorphic side
of the Schotky double, which will eventually be set to z̄.
In order to study martingales of stochastic LG it is convenient to consider the inverse
conformal map wt : Dt → D, which satisfies eq. (8). Correspondingly, we will consider the
Schottky double Σ = D ∪ ∂D ∪ D∗ , i.e., the Riemann surface obtained by gluing the exterior of
the disk D and its copy D∗ along the boundary ∂D. The Loewner-Kufarev equation (8) for the
chain (wt )t≥0 generates the infinitesimal conformal transformation wt → wt+dt = wt + (wt )
of D, where (wt ) = wt pt (wt )dt. Since Re p(wt ) < 0 at wt ∈ ∂D, the unit circle contracts
toward the origin with respect to the infinitesimal deformation (wt ). Similarly, one can say
that the time evolution of the contour on the plane can be considered as a certain dynamics
of the curve ∂D on the double Σ.

MARTINGALES OF STOCHASTIC LAPLACIAN GROWTH

13

Let us continue the Loewner flow (wt ) from D to the antiholomorphic side, D∗ , of the
double Σ by requiring the flow to be smooth upon crossing ∂D. By taking into account that
the function pt (w) has a jump across the unit circle (3), and noting that (w)/w = w̄(w)
when ww̄ = 1 and pt (1/w̄) = −p̄t (w̄), one concludes that the Loewner flow on D∗ in the
vicinity of ∂D is ε(w∗ ) = −¯
(w∗ ). Thus, the Loewner flows on both side of the Schottky
double Σ read:
(29)

dwt (z) = wt (z)pt (wt (z))dt,

dwt∗ (z ∗ ) = −wt∗ (z ∗ )p∗t (wt∗ (z ∗ ))dt,

where pt (w) is defined by eq. (2), and the function p∗t (w∗ ) can be written in terms of the
following contour integral:
Z 2π
dφ e−iφ + w∗
∗
∗
ρt (eiφ ).
(30)
pt (w ) =
2π e−iφ − w∗
0
The Loewner density for stochastic LG is given by eq. (14), where the real part of the analytic
function can be replaced by 2 Re f (w) = f (w) + f ∗ (w∗ ). Indeed, at the time instant t, when
the two sides of the Schottky double are glued along the unit circle, the involution between
¯
the sides identifies ξ ∗ with the complex conjugated ξ.
Besides, in addition to the driving processes (15) (where the complex conjugated coordinates, ξ¯n , should be replaced by the coordinates, ξn∗ , on the antiholomorphic side D∗ of the
double), the stochastic random processes ξn∗ ∈ D∗ , n = 1, 2, . . . , N , should be specified. In
order to be compatible with the flow (29) on Σ and eq. (15), the processes ξn∗ are expected
to be semimartingales, which satisfy the following set of coupled differential equations:
(31)

dξn∗
= σdqn − gn (ξ, ξ ∗ )dqn − idW,
ξn∗

n = 1, 2, . . . , N,

where the function gn (ξ, ξ ∗ ) is given by eq. (19), provided that the complex conjugated
∗
∗ N
coordinates {ξ¯n }N
n=1 are replaced by {ξn }n=1 on the antiholomorphic side of the double D .
Below, we will propose a family of functions on Σ, which are the martingales with respect to the stochastic Loewner flow (29) on the Schottky double Σ, driven by the random
processes (15), (31).
3.2. Exponential martingales on the Schottky double. In this section we determine a
family of martingales on the Schottky double with respect to the Loewner flows (29). Let us
proof auxiliary results first. In Appendix A we recall the basic features of Loewner chains
generated in stochastic LG (see Refs. [Ale19a, Ale19b] for details). In particular, on can
argue, that in the discrete time approximation the Loewner chain (zt )t≥0 can be written as
a finite sum of logarithmic terms (see eq. (66) below). Then, we can prove the following
Lemma.
Lemma 2. Let δn (t) = dist(ξn0 (t), ∂D) be the the distances between the poles, ξn0 (t), of zt0 (w)
and ∂D at time instant t. Let us define the following set of points
(32)

S = {z ∈ Dt |∀z : ∃δn (t) dist(wt (z), ∂D) < δn (t), ∂τ |wt0 (z)| = 0},

where ∂τ f = Im[n(z)∂z f ], n(zt (w)) = wzt0 (w)/|zt0 (w)|. Suppose that s ∈ S and consider the
logarithmic function of conformal factors, log(wt0 (s)wt0∗ (s∗ )), where s∗ = j(s) ∈ D∗ . Then,

The auxiliary time, q, is related with the time, t, by dq = ν|wt0 (s)|2 dt.

of the logarithms of the conformal factors:

dt
Let us consider the set S defined in (32). In the previous works [Ale19a, Ale19b] and
Appendix A we argued, that the poles, ξn0 , of zt0 (w) tend to ∂D following an exponential law in
the long time asymptotic, namely, dist(ξn0 (t), ∂D) ∝ exp(−rt /|cn,0 |), where rt is the conformal
radius, and cn,0 is a constant (see eq. (65) below). At the same time, from the results of
Ref. [DMW98] and a similarity of stochastic LG and the deterministic LG with stochastically
moving sources it follows, that dist(zt (1/ξ¯n0 (t)), ∂Dt ) = cn,0 + O(1/rt ), where zt (1/ξ¯n0 ) is the
0
tip of the fjord. Hence, for the points s from the line segment s ∈ [zt (ei arg ξn ), zt (1/ξ¯n0 )] we
have dist(wt (z), ∂D) < dist(ξn0 (z), ∂D). Besides, the harmonic measure reaches local minima,
∂τ |wt0 (z)| = 0 (where ∂τ is the tangential derivative along the interface), at the bottoms of
0
the fjords near the points z = zt (ei arg ξn ). Therefore, the set S is not empty.
Let us consider the point s ∈ S, so that wt (s) tends to ∂D following an exponential law as
rt → ∞. In this case, the difference between the integrals, wt p0 − wt∗ p∗0 , reduces to a single
contour integral around wt (s) (which can be considered as the boundary point wt (s) ∈ ∂D):
(34)

(35)
where

Note, that the density ρt (u) depends both on the holomorphic, and anti-holomorphic coordinates (14). However, at the unit circle one has ū = 1/u, and, therefore, ρt (u) can be
analytically continued away from the unit circle unless one encounters a critical point of
zt0 (w). Therefore, on can use residue theorem to evaluate the integral I(w).
Since s ∈ S , and wt (s) is closer to ∂D than any critical point of zt0 (u)z̄t0 (1/u), only the
residue at w contributes to the contour integral (36). Let us consider the contributions,
I = I1 + I2 , which appear upon differentiating the factor |zt0 (w)|−2 , and the expression in the
right hand side of eq. (14) correspondingly,

can be recast in the form −2|wt0 (s)|−4 Im (n(s)∂s |wt0 (s)|), where n(zt (w)) = wzt0 (w)/|zt0 (w)| is
the unit normal vector at s ∈ ∂Dt . Therefore, one obtains
(38)

I1 (wt (s)) = −8iwt (z)

ρt (wt (s))

Hence, the contribution (38) to the integral I(w) vanishes provided that s ∈ S is a local
extremum of the harmonic measure. In this case the value of the integral I(w) is given
by (37b) solely. Finally, because of eqs. (29) one can show that the difference p(wt ) − p∗ (wt∗ )
is equal to the variation of log(wt wt∗ ).

Remark 4. Below, it will be assumed that in the long time asymptotic the auxiliary times
q, q1 , q2 , . . . , qN can be chosen in such a way that dq = dq1 = · · · = dqN . Indeed, dq =
ν|wt0 (s)|2 dt, and s can be chosen from the subsets of the interface, ∂Dtα ⊂ ∂Dt , where the
harmonic measure scales with the exponent α. Besides, dqn = ν|wt0 (ζn0 )|2 dt, and one can
choose the initial conditions in such a manner, that near the tips of the fjords, ζn0 ’s, the
harmonic measure scales with the exponent α in the long time asymptotic (see Remark 1).
Hence, we will drop the subscripts n to qn ’s in what follows.
Note, that the variations (43) are not symmetric with respect to the interchange (ξ, w) →
(ξ ∗ , w∗ ). Moreover, by taking into account that Re pt (w) = −ρt (w), where ρt (w) is given
by (14), one obtains the coefficients, (κ/2 − 1) and (κ/2 + 1), in front of the second order
poles, (w−ξn )−2 and (w∗ −ξn∗ )−2 , respectively. Thus, these terms do not vanish simultaneously
for a specific value of the diffusion coefficient κ.
Now, we consider the exponential function, exp(γh), of random processes generated by
stochastic Loewner flow (29) on the Schottky double. The following proposition shows, that
for a specific value of the coupling parameter, namely, γ = κ−1/2 , the random processes are
martingales of stochastic Loewner flow on Σ.
Proposition 1. Let us consider the exponential function of the random process h introduced
in Lemma 3:

Mt (w; ξ) := Mt (w, w∗ ; ξ, ξ ∗ ) = e(1/

using Îto’s Lemma (42):

By applying this formula to the exponential function (44) one obtains eq. (45).

In the next section we discuss a connection between a family of exponential martingales,
Mt (w, ξ), of stochastic Loewner flow on the Schottky double Σ, and the stochastic LG of
the interface ∂Dt . The connection relies by the formula, which connects the Hadamard’s
variational formula for the Green’s function to the covariance of the martingales (44).
3.3. One-point exponential martingales and elementary deformations. First, let us
consider a family of the so-called elementary deformations of the domain [KMZ05]. The
elementary deformation of the domain with the base point ζ ∈ Dt is such deformation of Dt ,
that the displacement, δζ h(s), of the infinitesimal portion of the boundary at s ∈ ∂Dt along
the unit normal vector pointing inside Dt is proportional to the harmonic measure of that
portion of the boundary as viewed from the point ζ:
(47)

δζ ht (s) = −

νδt
∂n Gt (ζ, s),

s ∈ ∂Dt ,

ζ ∈ Dt ,

where νδt = δAt is the increment of the area, At , of the domain, and ∂n Gt (ζ, s) is the normal
derivative of the Dirichlet Green’s function with respect to the second variable. The elementary deformation of the domain can be considered as the result of the idealized deterministic
LG with the oil sink with rate ν placed at the point ζ ∈ Dt instead of infinity.
Let tk be the harmonic moments of the domain Dt with respect to the basis z −k /k:
Z

z −k d2 z,
k = 1, 2, . . .
(48)
tk = −

We also introduce t̄k to be the complex conjugated moments, and refer to t0 = (1/π) D+ d2 z
t

as to the area (divided by π) of the bounded domain Dt+ = C \ Dt . These harmonic moments
are nothing but the coefficient
R of the Taylor expansion of the logarithmic gravity potential of
the domain, Π(z) = (−2/π) Dt log |z − z 0 |d2 z, z ∈ Dt+ .
The harmonic moments (t0 , t1 , t̄1 , . . . ) form a set of local coordinates in the space of smooth
closed planar curves [KMZ05, Tak01]. Elementary deformations of the domain δζ allow one
to introduce the vector field,

which spans the (complexified) tangent space to the space of curves. The variation of any
functional of the domain F (t0 , t1 , t̄1 , . . . ) with respect to the elementary deformation with the
base point ζ can be considered as the action of the vector field ∇(ζ): δζ F = ν∇(ζ)F δt.
The elementary deformations plays an important role for studying the integrable structure
of deterministic LG. The variation of the Green’s function, ∇(ζ)Gt (z, z 0 ), with respect to the
elementary deformation (47) can be obtained by using Hadamard’s variational formula:

a key relation which relates the Dirichlet problem and deterministic LG problem with the universal Whitham hierarchy [Kri94], known as dispersionless Toda lattice (see Refs. [KMWWZ04,
MWZ02]).
Let us consider the variation of the Green’s function, G(z, s), at the boundary of the
domain, z ∈ Dt , s ∈ ∂Dt with respect to the elementary deformation with the base point
ζ ∈ Dt . From the Hadamard’s formula (50) it follows:
1
∇(ζ)Gt (z, s) = ∂n Gt (ζ, s)∂n Gt (z, s),
s ∈ ∂Dt .
2
Thus, the variation of the Green’s function at the boundary is given by the product of two
Poisson kernels, Ht (ζ, s) and Ht (z, s), defined by eq. (7). Now, the following proposition can
be formulated.
(51)

Proposition 2. Let us consider elementary deformations of the domain generated by sto(1)

Let Mt (w, ξ1 ), Mt (w, ξ2 ) be the one-point martingales of the corresponding flows, where w =
wt (s), and s ∈ S introduced in Lemma 2. Then, the covariance of dMt (w, ξ1 ) and dMt (w, ξ2 )
is proportional to the variation of the Dirichlet Green’s function Gt (ζ2 , s) with respect to the
elementary deformation of the domain with the base point ζ1 :
(53)

Cov[dMt (w, ξ1 ), dMt (w, ξ2 )] = −α1 α2 Mt (w, ξ1 )Mt (w, ξ2 )∇(ζ1 )Gt (ζ2 , s)dt.

where ζ1 = zt (1/ξ¯1 ), and ζ2 = zt (1/ξ¯2 ).
Proof. Because the driving process W is proportional to standard Brownian motion in the
auxiliary time q one has E[dW dW ] = (κ/2)dq, where E denotes the expectation value. Therefore, the expectation value of the product of the one-point martingales reads:
(54) E[dMt (w, ξ1 )dMt (w, ξ2 )] = −

Since ∂n G equals the Poisson kernel (25), one concludes that the variation of the Green’s
function with respect to the elementary deformation (51) is proportional to the product of
the Poisson kernels, which appear in the right hand side of eq. (54). Because Mt ’s are the
martingales, the covariance is given by the expectation value: Cov[dMt , dMt ] = E[dMt dMt ].

3.4. Multi-point martingales and local fluctuations of pressure. Thus far, we have
considered the sink at infinity with the rate Q/2π as the deterministic sink, i.e., as the sink
with the fixed position. However, the stochastic LG model, introduced in Section 2.4, can be
easily generalized to the case of the source, which moves stochastically with time near infinity.
Henceforth, we assume that the interface dynamics is generated by N + 1 random processes
ξ = (ξ0 , ξ, . . . , ξN ) ∈ D+ , with the rates (α0 , α1 , . . . , αn ), and α0 = −2σ. The stochastic
differential equation for the driving processes (15) should be modified in a trivial way. One
replaces the constant drift toward the origin, −σdqn , with the corresponding interaction terms

As explained in the beginning of Section 2.5, the dynamics of the interface ∂Dt in the z
plane is generated by the set of virtual sources ζ = (ζ0 , ζ1 , . . . , ζN ) ∈ Dt , where ζn = zt (1/ξ¯n ),
n = 0, 1, . . . , N . The effective pressure field in the vicinity of the interface is given by the
linear combination of the Green’s functions (22). Therefore, we have the following corollary
of Lemma 2.
Corollary 1. Let us consider the function (40) of N +1 random processes ξn , n = 0, 1, 2 · · · , N .
Suppose that λ0 = −σ and E(ξ0 ) = 0. Then, the variance of the exponential martingale,
Mt (w, ξ) determines the variation of pressure dPt (z, ζ) with respect to stochastic LG,
(58)

dCov[Mt (w, ξ), Mt (w, ξ)] = Mt2 (w, ξ)dPt (s, ζ),

where w = wt (s), ξn = 1/w̄t (ζ̄n ), and s ∈ S introduced in Lemma 2.
Proof. The statement immediately follows from Lemma 1 and Proposition 2.

4. Conclusion and discussion
In conclusion, we briefly summarize the main result of this work. We studied stochastic
LG problem in the framework of Loewner-Kufarev equation drive by the nonlocal random
measure on the unit circle (14). Because of intrinsic instability of the growth process, tiny
fluctuations of pressure in the vicinity of the interface results in the formation of universal
patterns with deep fjords in the long time asymptotic, which can be studied both numerically
and analytically [Ale19a]. These patterns are closely related with the so-called logarithmic
solutions to deterministic LG problem, which are free of finite-time singularities (cusps) on
the boundary.
In Ref. [Ale19b] it was shown, that certain quotients of correlation functions of boundary
CFTs do not change with respect to conformal transformations generated by the stochastic
Loewner flow. Hence, these functions are martingales of stochastic LG. In this work we
studied martingales by using conventional methods of stochastic calculus. In particular,
we proposed a family of functions (44) on the Schottky double of the exterior domain Dt ,
and studied their variation with respect to stochastic Loewner flow. The proposed family of
martingales are closely connected to CFT correlation functions in the Coulomb gas formalism.
A direct connection between the martingales and stochastic LG problem relies on Hadamard’s
variational formula for the Green’s function of the Dirichlet boundary problem. We showed,

20

O. ALEKSEEV

that the variation of pressure near the interface can be written in terms of the covariance of
the martingales on the Schottky double.
Let us briefly discuss a relation between the family of martingales proposed in this work,
and the results of the previous work [Ale19b]. The exponential martingales introduced in
Proposition 1 are the correlation functions of the so-called vertex operators Vα,ᾱ (z, z̄). The
vertex operators are exponential functions, Vα,ᾱ (z, z̄) = exp(αϕ(z) + ᾱϕ̄(z̄)), of the Gaussian
free field ϕ(z). Correlation functions of product of vertex operators can be easily computed
due to the simple form of the GFF correlators, hϕ(z)ϕ(z 0 )i = − log(z − z 0 ), hϕ(z)ϕ̄(z̄ 0 )i = 0,
and hϕ̄(z̄)ϕ̄(z̄ 0 )i = − log(z̄ − z̄ 0 ). In particular, the function ZN , given by the product (20), is
the correlation function of N vertex operators. We will not go into detail here, and consider
the coupling of the Gaussian free field to the stochastic LG problem in future publication.
By the above short remark we wish to emphasize, that the family of martingales proposed in
this paper is a subclass of martingales proposed earlier [Ale19b]. The Coulomb gas formalism,
mentioned above, allows one not only to obtain the correlation functions explicitly, but also
to determine critical exponents of various lattice models of statistical mechanics. Besides,
this method was applied to find multifractal spectrum of harmonic measure of conformally
invariant SLE curves [Gru06], because the Coulomb gas formalism captures the singular
behavior of CFT correlation functions. Hence, the next step is to use the results obtained in
this paper to study critical exponents associated with the stochastic LG problem.
Another motivation to study stochastic interface dynamics in the Coulomb gas framework
is the Duplantier-Sheffield approach to Liouville quantum gravity [DS11]. In particular, the
Gaussian free field, which naturally appears in the Coulomb gas formalism is a natural object
in Liouville quantum gravity, which determines the random measure on the space of curves.
We believe, that this method can be used in order to couple stochastic LG to random geometry.

Appendix A. The pattern formation in stochastic LG
The LG problem can be rewritten in terms of the Schwarz function, which provides an
elegant geometrical interpretation of the interface dynamics. The Schwarz function is defined
as what follows (see Ref. [Dav74] for details). Let ∂Dt be a sufficiently smooth curve drawn
on the plane. It can be determined by the equation F (x, y) = 0. By replacing (x, y) by the
complex coordinates (z = x+iy, z̄ = x−iy), and solving the equation F ((z + z̄)/2, (z − z̄)/2) =
0 with respect to z̄ one obtains
(59)

z̄ = St (z),

z ∈ ∂Dt .

The analytical continuation of St (z) away from the curve is called the Schwarz function. The
Schwarz function can be decomposed into a sum of two function, St+ and St− , that are regular
in Dt+ and Dt respectively:
St+ (z) =

MARTINGALES OF STOCHASTIC LAPLACIAN GROWTH

following equation [How92]:
(61)

∂t St (z) = 2∂z Wt (z),

where Wt (z) = −Pt (z)+iΨt (z) is the complex potential given by the sum of negative pressure
Pt (z) and the stream function Ψt (z). Since the complex potential for the idealized deterministic LG is Wt (z) = (Q/2π) log wt (z), eq. (61) reduces to ∂t St+ (z) = 0 for z ∈ Dt . From this
equation one concludes that all moments tn , n = 1, 2, . . . , are integrals of motion.
Contrary to the deterministic problem, in the case of stochastic LG the moments, tk , vary
with time. The effective pressure field for stochastic LG (22) attributes the local fluctuations
of pressure in the vicinity of the interface to the set virtual sources in Dt , so that ∇2 P (z, ξ) =

n=1 δ (z − ζn ), where ζn = zt (1/ξn ) ∈ Dt , n = 1, 2, . . . , N . Because the points ζn are the

If ζn = const the Schwarz function has simple poles in Dt with the residues linearly growing
with time. From the physical point of view, this process represents LG with oil wells at
the points ζn with the rates ν. In stochastic LG the time evolution of virtual sources, ζn ,
n = 1, 2, . . . , N , results in the formation of N cuts of the Schwarz function in Dt . Hence, St+ ,
can be represented as a sum of the Cauchy type integrals,

where the integration contours γn (t), n = 1, 2, . . . , N , are the trajectories of the points ζn =
zt (1/ξ¯n ) in Dt , and the Cauchy densities Pn (l) for stochastic LG are determined by the
velocities of these points.
It is instructive to consider stochastic LG in a discrete time framework. Let DI be domain
occupied by viscous fluid at the time instant tI = Iδt. Then, the Schwarz function of its
boundary, ∂DI , can be obtained from eq. (62) (see Ref. [Ale19a] for detail):

St+ , in Dt during ith time unit. Note, that the logarithmic representation of the Schwarz
function (64) is connected to the Causchy representation (63) upon the integration by parts.
The geometrical interpretation of logarithmic singularities of the Schwarz function is straightforward [DMW98]: each logarithmic term in the right hand side of eq. (64) corresponds to the
fjords with parallel walls in the long time asymptotic. The tips of the fjords are located at the
points {{ζn (ti )}Ii=0 }N
n=1 . The widths of the fjords are given by π|cn,i |, while their orientations
are specified by arg(cn,i ). In Fig. 4 we show a typical shape of the interface at the bottom

Re z(eiφ , t), near the bottom of the fjord is plotted for two different values of
the noise strength: (a) corresponds to κ = 6 and (b) corresponds to κ = 16.
The widths of fjords are determined by the ratio ν/Q = 0.04. In the discrete
¯
time framework, the random process ζ(t) = zt (1/ξ(t))
generates a variety
of tiny fjords on the microscale, which correspond to logarithmic terms in
eq. (66). The boxed region in (a) shows the interface in the vicinity of the
point x = 10, y = 0, magnified 20-fold and 200-fold correspondingly. Since the
interface exhibits similar patterns at increasingly small scales, the interface in
the bottoms of fjords has a fractal structure.
of the fjord in the long time asymptotic. A variety of tiny fjords on the microscale form a
fractal pattern in the vicinity of the bottom of deep fjords on the macroscale.
A connection of the Schwarz function to the conformal map, St (z) = z̄t (1/w), where
z = zt (w), implies a one-to-one correspondence between singularities of zt inside the unit
disk, D+ , in the w plane, and singularities of St+ in Dt . In particular, if St+ has a logarithmic
branch point at ζn with the coefficient cn,i , then the conformal map possesses the same branch
point at ξni (tI ) = 1/w̄I (ζ̄n (ti )) with the coefficient c̄n,i . Hence, from (64) one can immediately
determine the conformal map zI : D → DI , namely,

where αk = const, k = 1, 2, . . . , K. Here the logarithmic terms, αk log(w/ak (tI )−1), represent
tiny deviations of the initial domain D0 from a perfect circle. If the initial interface, ∂D0 ,
is a circle, all αk = 0. From eq. (64) it follows, that zt (1/āk (t)) are the constant of motion.
Besides, logarithmic branch points of SI+ at the point ζn (ti ) = zI (1/ξ¯ni (tI )) with i < I also stay
constants with time for the time instants. The positions of these points, i.e., the trajectories
of the processes ζn (t) in the z plane, determine the centerlines of the fjords on the macroscale.
Contrary to the deterministic LG, where the number of singularities of the conformal map
does not change, in stochastic LG the total number of singularities growth linearly with time.
Let us consider a family of abelian domains, whose uniformization maps wt has rational
derivatives wt0 (z) = P (z)/Q(z). Let us define the degree of the abelian domain, deg wt , as

MARTINGALES OF STOCHASTIC LAPLACIAN GROWTH

23

follows: deg wt = max(deg P, deg Q). Let us consider the abelian domain Di of degree M at
time instant ti . Then, a single step of stochastic LG generated by density (14) results in the
algebraic domain Di+1 of degree not higher than M + N . In the continuum limit, δt → 0,
the generation of singularities of the Schwarz function can be interpreted as the evolution of
the branch-cuts of the Schwarz function (63) with time.
Now, let us briefly describe a possible asymptotic behavior of zeroes and poles of the
derivative, zt0 (w), of the conformal map. Although stochastic LG does not preserve the
total number of poles of zt0 (w), the interface evolution during ith growth step is equivalent
to the idealized deterministic Laplacian in presence of N + 1 oil sources: N oil wells
P at
¯
ζn = zt (1/ξn (ti )) with rates ν, and the oil sink at infinity with the rate (Q/2π) + N ν αn .
Hence, an asymptotic behavior of poles and zeroes can be obtained by using the results for
deterministic LG [DMW98].
Let us consider the conformal map zI : D → DI , which has the form (66) with K logarithmic
branch-cuts inherited from the initial conditions (i.e., from singularities of S0+ (z)), and N I
logarithmic terms generated by stochastic LG with density (14). Suppose that the positions
of all singularities of zI (w) are known. Let us show, that stochastic LG during the next time
unit, I + 1, can be reduced to the many-body-type problem for the motion of poles of zt0 (w)
inside the unit disk described by a system of stochastic ordinary differential equations. Since
stochastic LG is equivalent to the idealized deterministic growth with moving source, one has
the following integrals of motion:
(67)

βk = zI+1 (1/āk (tI+1 )),

γn,i = zI+1 (1/ξ¯ni (tI+1 )),

for k = 1, 2, . . . , K, n = 1, 2, . . . , N , and i = 1, 2, . . . , I. During the (I + 1)th growth step,
the conformal map develop N new poles at the points, ξnI+1 (tI+1 ), n = 1, 2, . . . , N , given by
solutions to the set of coupled stochastic differential equations (15). The coefficients, cn,I+1
in front of the logarithmic terms in zI+1 (w) (see eq. (66)) are specified by N equations (68).
The conformal radius, rI+1 , can be determined by the area A, enclosed by ∂DI+1 . Since the
total growth rate is Q, one has ∂t A = Q, we get the equation
(68)

tI+1 =

and c̄n,I+1 , for K = 1, 2, . . . , K, n = 1, 2, . . . , N , and i = 1, 2, . . . , I + 1. Hence, we conclude,
that stochastic LG is a self-consisted problem. It can be recast in the many-body problem
for the dynamics of poles of the conformal map inside the unit circle.
It is known, that the logarithmic solution (66) to idealized LG problem does not produce
cusp at the interface for a wide class of initial conditions [DMW98]. Therefore, poles and
zeroes of zt0 (w) never hit the unit circle. A possible asymptotic behavior of poles can be
obtained by considering the large time asymptotic of the right hand sides of eqs. (67). Because
of eq. (68), the function rt2 growth with time, i.e., rt → ∞ as t → ∞. Then, the only
possibility to cancel the divergent terms in γn,i and βk is to suppose that some points from
the sets {ξni (tI )} and {ak (tI )} tend to the unit circle as tI → ∞ following an exponential
law. We do not give a careful analysis of the asymptotic behavior and refer the reader to
Ref. [DMW98] for the similar analysis in the case of deterministic LG.
