We study high-temperature magnetization transport in a many-body spin-1/2 chain with on-site
quasiperiodic potential governed by the Fibonacci rule. In the absence of interactions it is known that
the system is critical with the transport described by a continuously varying dynamical exponent
(from ballistic to localized) as a function of the on-site potential strength. Upon introducing weak
interactions, we find that an anomalous noninteracting dynamical exponent becomes diffusive for
any potential strength. This is borne out by a boundary-driven Lindblad dynamics as well as unitary
dynamics, with agreeing diffusion constants. This must be contrasted to random potential where
transport is subdiffusive at such small interactions. Mean-field treatment of the dynamics for small U
always slows down the non-interacting dynamics to subdiffusion, and is therefore unable to describe
diffusion in an interacting quasiperiodic system. Finally, briefly exploring larger interactions we find
a regime of interaction-induced subdiffusive dynamics, despite the on-site potential itself having no
“rare-regions”.

INTRODUCTION

How are transport and localization properties altered
when correlations are introduced to local fields, both in
free fermionic and, particularly, in interacting systems?
This is the question we address in this paper, focussing on
a class of quasiperiodic systems. Indeed, in experimental
cold atom systems, quasiperiodic systems are more easily
realized and have been routinely investigated to address
both these aspects1–5
A textbook one-dimensional (1D) system that is able
to describe many gross features of real materials is the
tight-binding model6 , where particles (e.g., electrons)
can hop only between nearest neighbor lattice sites. An
on-site potential can drastically influence the nature of
eigenstates, and as a consequence the dynamics of the
system: an uncorrelated potential can turn extended
states in the clean system to localized states7 , whereas
correlations in the potential can either turn the states to
critical (like in the Fibonacci model)8–11 or induce a fieldstrength induced transition between extended and localized states (Aubry-Andre-Harper, or AAH, model)12,13 .
An important question is what happens to these states
and phases, be it in a random or a quasiperiodic potential, in the presence of interactions. In particular, can localization survive14 , and, if so, under which conditions?
And if not, how do the erstwhile extended states now
transport conserved quantities?
The persistence of localization in the presence of interactions − many-body localization (MBL) − is considered
well established in a range of systems15–17 . There is also
mounting evidence that, in a paradigmatic XXZ model
with random fields18 , prior to the MBL transition slow
subdiffusive magnetization dynamics sets in and contin-

uously slows down to a complete stoppage of transport
as the transition point is crossed19–27 . Note that extracting asymptotics of transport in the ergodic phase can be
difficult 28–30 , see also our comments later on in the text.
What is less established are the critical properties of the
transition itself, like its universality class31 . For instance,
presently employed renormalization group schemes32–34
of merging fully ergodic and fully localized blocks might
predict different critical properties of the transition if
the blocks are allowed to be subthermal; the presence
of such blocks can potentially change or slow down the
“avalanche” instabilities of localized regions against nonlocalized bubbles35–37 . This is because in a subthermal
block one has a scaling relation x ∼ tβ with β < 21 between length and time, meaning that the thermalization
time scales at least as ∼ L1/β , i.e., it is very long for
small β.
In particular, by considering quasiperiodic systems we
may test the heuristic explanation for subdiffusion as
arising from “rare-regions”19,38,39 – regions of abnormally
high potential gradients – that in 1D systems can function as bottlenecks to transport, resulting in subdiffusion
even in the thermal phase. In the absence of rare regions
(like in quasiperiodic systems), however, one therefore
expects only diffusive transport all the way to the MBL
transition. Indeed for the interacting AAH model 40–53 ,
this was to a certain extend observed48,50 , see however
e.g. Refs. 5 and 53. In particular, the analysis of transport for small interactions U reveals50 that the transition
at U = 0 is discontinuous, and that there is no localized
phase around a non-interacting transition at hc = 2 (as
opposed to previous continuity-based suggested phase diagrams at small-U 3,54 ). Such qualitatively different nature of the ergodic phase might also affect the universal-

ity class of the MBL transition in quasiperiodic systems;
indeed the presence of multiple MBL universality classes
has been suggested from numerical evidence45,55 . There
is also evidence that the structure of l-bits deep in the
MBL phase are fundamentally changed due to certain
types of quasiperiodicity56 ; this implies that procedures
to extract them57–59 will likely also need to be modified
to reliably extract the new structure of l-bits.
Motivated by the above considerations we address
the question of transport in the Fibonacci quasiperiodic
model. There are several reasons rendering this an interesting undertaking. First, there is a general question of
how correlations, e.g. random vs. quasiperiodic potential, influence transport and MBL. However, also within
quasiperiodic systems the Fibonacci model offers several
important advantages going beyond the much more commonly studied AAH model. The noninteracting model
is critical, showing eigensystem (multi)fractality8–11,60 ,
for any potential amplitude and therefore serves as one
of the simplest deterministic systems with anomalous
transport61 in closed and open setting62 . We note that
(multi) fractality is typical at Anderson transitions63 .
The natural question that arises is: how much do these
anomalous transport properties that arise from eigenspectrum fractality (and not a priori rare-regions) persist
upon introducing weak interactions to the system? At
low temperatures the interacting model has been studied
using bosonization, finding64,65 an anomalous transport
with the scaling exponent depending on the interaction
strength and the position of Fermi level. On the other
hand at high temperatures, studed in the present paper,
and at strong interaction Ref. 56 interestingly found signs
of nondiffusive transport and an MBL transition despite
the noninteracting problem having no localized phase.
In the present paper we study transport in the in-

teracting Fibonacci model for small interactions at high
temperature and half-filling (zero magnetization). The
phase diagram obtained is shown in Fig. 1 . For small
interactions U and available potential strengths h ≤ 3 we
always find diffusion. Anomalous transport discontinuously breaks down to diffusion for any nonzero U . This
is similar as in the AAH model50 , with some differences
though. One is for instance that at larger potential h
transport is qualitatively faster in the Fibonacci model
than in the AAH model. At larger U = 0.5 and h = 2 we,
perhaps surprisingly, also observe subdiffusion. This is at
variance with a rare-region explanation of subdiffusion
but roughly in-line with Ref. 56 where certain similarity is observed between the AAH and Fibonacci models
at large U . Considering a common discrepancy between
different transport studies, a special care is taken using
large systems L . 1000 and times t . 1000 to show convergence of two different methods to the same transport.
We also show that a mean-field treatment, that would
argue for a dephasing-like explanation of diffusion, is in
fact subdiffusive and therefore fails to correctly describe
dynamics in the Fibonacci model at small U .

NONINTERACTING FIBONACCI MODEL

The noninteracting Fibonacci model is described by
the Hamiltonian:

with a Fibonacci
sequence potential, hk = 2hV (kg) − h,

where g = ( 5 − 1)/2 and periodic V (x) := [x + g] − [x]
with [x] being an integer part of x. Beginning of the
sequence is hk = h(+1, −1, +1, +1, −1, +1, −1, +1, . . .).
To study transport we initialize the system with a
delta function at the central site and compute the meansquared displacement

|ψ(t)i = exp(−itH)|ψ(0)i,

is the unitarily evolved initial state with the Fibonacci
Hamiltonian. We employ a dynamical fit ∆x2 ∼ t2β in
order to discern the rate of transport: β = 1 implies
ballistic transport, β = 0 signifies no transport, and
β = 1/2 denotes diffusive transport. This is in line with
the approach of earlier works61,62,66 but is undertaken
here more systematically (larger system sizes, as well as
inclusion of comparison of finite-size effects). Secondly,
we also consider a new set of initial conditions such that
the system is far from linear response. In particular, the
system is initialized with a fully polarized domain wall
(DW) pure state
|ψ(0)i = |DWi = |↑ · · · ↑↓ · · · ↓i,

(4)

3
where up/down arrows indicates spins initialized in up or
down direction in z-direction. Here the dynamical rate
is quantified by measuring the change in total spin on
either half of the chain:

We will find that βDW = β, therefore we will use only
one symbol from hereon. Note that differently from Ref.
61 we do not consider an inversion symmetric potential
as a special, and only, sample: we have checked that
for dynamics on this sample the exponent only slightly
increases by about 5% compared to the values we have
presented. Indeed the inversion symmetric potential for
the AAH model too is special62 except that there it instead gives a slightly smaller dynamical exponent than
for the case of averaged data or a generic sample.
Let us first summarize the known physics of the model.
In the Fibonacci model the potential is binary, with only
two values ±h, with a quasiperiodic spatial structure following√a Fibonacci sequence, hk = h(2V (kg) − 1), where
g = ( 5 − 1)/2 and periodic V (x) := [x + g] − [x] with
[x] being an integer part of x. Compared to the AAH
model the potential has a broad momentum spectrum67
(instead of a single Fourier component) and is therefore at the other extreme end56 of the Fourier spectrum
broadness (it has as slowly decaying spectrum as possible, compared to as sharply localized one as possible
for the AAH model). One of the consequences is that
the noninteracting version is critical8–11 for any h. The
noninteracting Fibonacci model displays a full spectrum
of transport scaling exponents61,62 , going from ballistic
β = 1 for h = 0 to localized β → 0 for h → ∞. By taking the interacting version we can therefore study, besides
the above mentioned effects that a quasiperiodic potential has, also the question of stability against interactions
of an arbitrary anomalous transport.
Let us now explain the technicalities of the model. The
Fibonacci sequence required for the Fibonacci model may
also be constructed
 from two symbols
  F, S by the subF
1 1
F
stitution rule
→
. The transforS
1 0
S
mation matrix has the eigenvalues g, 1/g. Repeated application of the above rule gives the series of Fibonacci
sequences:
{F, F S, F SF, F SF F S, F SF F SF SF, . . .}.

(6)

Note that the length of each sequence is a Fibonacci
number: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 . . ., and that, by construction, any
sequence always starts with the sequence of any smaller
one. A given cut of length L of any (sufficiently long)
Fibonacci sequence determines one sample or configuration of the quasiperiodic chain of length L, where the
quasidisorder potential hk on site k takes the value ±h
depending on whether the symbol on that site is F or
S respectively; note that the full long sequence is of Fibonacci length but that need not be true for L, the system size under study. Moreover, unlike disordered systems where infinite samples exist even for finite systems,

h, increasing from top to bottom for a single sample; the
crosses indicate data for L = 2001 system averaged over 50
samples. As h increases, the dynamics gets slower and is
anomalous for any nonzero h. Moreover the log-periodic oscillations also increases as h is increased. Only for infinite
h is the chain localized. Note that the domain-wall data
have been scaled by arbitrary constants O(1) in order to highlight the equality of dynamical exponents more clearly. Bottom: Dynamical exponent extracted from all such data in

from L = 2000, 2001 averaged data. it shows a smooth analytic variation with h, interpolating between ballistic β = 1
and localization β = 0.

here only finite number of samples exist: for instance,
on a 3-site chain, the only allowed configurations are
F SF, F F S, SF F, SF S i.e. L + 1 configurations in general. However, note that the second and third configurations are reflections of each other, reducing the effective
number of independent configurations to half of that.
In Fig. 2 we display the spread of an initial wavepacket
that is localized at the chain centre and the transfer
of magnetization across the centre of the chain when it

4
is initialized to a domain wall state (left half of chain
has magnetization -1/2, right half has magnetization
+1/2 at time t = 0). We find that the dynamics is
identical (top panel), implying equality of dynamical
exponents (bottom panel) for these two initial states.
As has been found previously for localized wavepacket
spreading61,62,66 there is a continuous decay of the exponent β with the field strength. Additionally, we find
here that the transport rate is robust and remains the
same even for bulk excitations such as a domain wall inhomogeneity in the system. For h = 0.6, 1.0, 2.0, and
3.0, that we study in the remainder of the paper, we find
β = 0.75, 0.61, 0.46, 0.39, respectively. Diffusive β = 1/2
is in particular achieved at hdiff ≈ 1.6.
In the Appendix A we in addition show convergence with system size, self-similar structure of a noninteracting ψ(t), and the effects of averaging over different potential instances.

with the same Fibonacci sequence for hk . We will use
two different settings to study transport, one will use an
explicit boundary driving that will cause the system to
converge to a time-independent nonequilibrium steady
state (NESS), the other will be looking at a unitary evolution of a particular initial state. Both give consistent
results with the same value of diffusion constant. We
shall first briefly describe both settings and then focus
on the results (Subsection III C).

A.

Nonequilibrium steady state

The simplest way to describe a nonequilibrium setting
with an explicit driving that obeys all the rules of quantum mechanics (preserving positive semi-definiteness of
ρ) is via the Lindblad68,69 master equation,
dρ/dt = i[ρ, H] + Ldis (ρ).

(8)

There are two parts in the r.h.s. generator: one is the
standard commutator that would, standing alone, generate unitary evolution, and the other is a so-called dissipator Ldis that effectively describes a bath. The dissipator is written

right end, σ ± = (σ x ±i σ y )/2. They represent magnetization reservoirs at infinite temperature and induce magnetization (spin) transport. Namely, the driving parameter
µ essentially determines magnetization at the edges such
that in long non-ballistic systems the boundary magnetization converges to hσ1z i = µ at the left edge and to
z
i = −µ at the right edge. We use a small µ = 0.1 so
hσL
that all our results are in a linear response regime. Note
that for µ = 0 the steady state would be ρ∞ ∝ 1, i.e.,
an infinite temperature equilibrium state, and so small µ
will results in a steady state that is at infinite temperature. Such a driving induces only magnetization flow
(energy flow is zero). While justifying strong coupling
that we use (||Lk || ∼ 1) on microscopic grounds is hard70
in the thermodynamic limit (TDL) details of a boundary driving should not matter for bulk physics. This can
indeed be rigorously shown71 for diffusive systems.
After long time a time-dependent solution ρ(t) of
eq. (8) converges to a nonequilibrium steady state
(NESS), ρ(t) → ρ∞ , which is in our case unique. We
find NESS ρ∞ by evolving ρ(t) using time-dependent
renormalization group method (tDMRG)72 . The method
proceeds by writing expansion coefficients of ρ(t) in a
Pauli basis as a product of matrices, a so-called matrix
product operator (MPO) ansatz, and then evolving it in
time by Trotterization into small time steps of length
dt = 0.2 (we use a 4th order Trotter-Suzuki decomposition). Our adaptation for nonunitary evolution is
described in Ref. 73. Two parameters that determine
the required computational effort are the relaxation time
needed to converge to ρ∞ and the matrix product oper-

5
ator (MPO) bond dimension χ. The relaxation time will
increase with system size L, and similarly increase when
transport gets slow. This makes the method work best
for non-localized phases. How the required χ depends on
physical properties is harder to say in advance; we typically find that one needs larger bonds for larger h and/or
when one approaches a possible subdiffusive transition.
If one can afford to have bond sizes of several hundred74 ,
and relaxation times ∼ 103 , this in some cases allows to
study system sizes up to L ∼ 1000 sites (see e.g. Ref. 23),
making the method in that regime by far the best one.
Once the NESS is obtained one can calculate the expectation values in the steady state. For the question of
transport the most important ones are the expectation
value of local magnetization szk = 21 σkz and the associated spin current j,
j := tr[(sxk syk+1 − syk sxk+1 )ρ∞ ],

(9)

which is, due to continuity equation, independent of the
site index k. Expectation value of szk in the NESS goes
(in the TDL) from +µ/2 to −µ/2 across the chain so that
for the case of diffusion one has the Fick’s law

introducing a transport scaling exponent β. If one has a
single scaling exponent then simple dimensional analysis
gives a relation between β of the unitary evolution and
γ of the NESS, namely
β=

γ+1

(13)

To assess the asymptotic transport one needs to simulate evolution up to as long times as possible. For that
one again uses the tDMRG method on a matrix product
ansatz. A decisive quantity is how fast the “entanglement” grows with time, or equivalently, how far in time
one can go with a given maximal χ. While one could
evolve a pure state, it turns out that doing unitary evolution on an ensemble of states, that is on a density operator ρ, can be (structurally) more stable, allowing to
simulate longer times. A good choice of an initial state
for studying magnetization transport is a weakly polarized domain wall75 ,

with a scaling exponent γ 6= 1. γ > 1 signifies subdiffusion while γ < 1 would describe superdiffusion (γ = 0
indicating ballistic transport).
The whole machinery is illustrated in the top Fig. 3.
We always calculate ρ∞ for several χ, thereby checking
the convergence as well as getting an estimate for the
error due to finite χ. In all plots we show data for the
largest χ, or, if the estimated errors are larger than about
∼ 1%, the extrapolated data. For details on the convergence with χ see Appendix B. In Fig. 3(a) we can see that
for small h and U and small system sizes L profiles are
not yet linear as one would expect for a diffusive system.
However for larger systems, e.g. L = 377, the asymptotic
regime is reached with linear magnetization profile. This
is also reflected in the scaling of current j with system
size, Fig. 3(b). For too small systems j(L) does not yet
“feel” the full interacting dynamics and j(L) falls with
L in a slower superdiffusive fashion, being though just
a remnant of the superdiffusive noninteracting physics
(at h = 0.6). However, at larger L the true asymptotic
transport is reached with diffusive j ∼ 1/L scaling.
B.

starting with an initial wave-packet that has a nonstationary Gaussian profile of magnetization one could
look at how the width ∆x of the packet grows with time,

Unitary evolution

Another way to probe transport is by looking at the
spreading on inhomogeneous initial states. For instance,

Transport type can then be assessed by e.g. looking at
how magnetization transported about the mid-point of
the chain grows with time. That is,

In all our simulations we use small m = 10−3 meaning
that we are again in a linear response regime. An example of such a simulation is shown in the bottom Fig. 3.
One obvious observation from Fig. 3(d) is that the interacting case starts to differ from a noninteracting one only
after times larger than ∼ 1/U . After that a further transient time is required to reach the asymptotic transport.
A similar conclusion can be reached observing magnetization profiles in Fig. 3(c). At short t = 32 both interacting and noninteracting profiles look similar and very

6
“noisy” due to (non-interacting) multi-fractality. However, at longer time t = 128 one can see that the interacting dynamics slows down and the profile becomes much
smoother – both being manifestations of the asymptotic
diffusive dynamics.
We again stress, see also e.g. Ref. 23, that if the integrability breaking perturbation is small, be it a small h
or a small U , large times (large systems in the NESS setting) are needed in order to see the true transport type76 .
Ignoring that can lead to incorrect results, an example
being Ref. 77 where too short times are used rendering
most of their claims false78 .
C.

Diffusion for small U

At small U and for a range of potential strengths h ≤ 3
that we are able to reliably simulate we always find diffusive magnetization transport (at high temperature and
half-filling that we study). The diffusion constant agrees
between the NESS and unitary evolutions, see Table I
. Different methods aiming at the same physical quantity should of course agree, but we note that empirically
that is far from being an established fact. For instance,
for random potential different publications often report
even different transport types (see e.g. comparison in
Fig. 1 of Ref. 79). The agreement that we find is therefore nontrivial and gives a further weight to our results.
For the boundary driven Lindblad equation that we use
one can in fact derive a NESS version of Kubo formula
and show rigorously71 that if the dynamics is diffusive
the two settings give exactly the same diffusion constant
D, with a finite-size correction being of order ∼ 1/L.

values of 4 · D, which would be the diffusion constant if we

would use Pauli operators, like σkx σk+1
, instead of spin-1/2
ones, like sxk sxk+1 .

Obtaining diffusion for an arbitrarily small U is surprising. Recall that in the free model (U = 0) the transport type continuously varies with h and therefore an
arbitrary non-interacting β immediately breaks down to
a diffusive β = 1/2 for nonzero U . We have to stress that
this is very different than for a random potential. There
the breakdown happens continuously, going from Anderson localization for U = 0 through a subdiffusive regime
for small nonzero U . That is, if instead of a Fibonacci

Figure 4. Unitary evolution of a weakly polarized domain wall
for the Fibonacci potential (black full curve, average over 5
potential instances) and random binary potential (red dashed
curve, average over 20 random instances) for the same parameters h = 1, U = 0.1 and L = 144. Transport in the
quasiperiodic Fibonacci case is diffusive (Dunit = 0.67), while
it is subdiffusive for the random case.

sequence of potential values, for which one has diffusion,
one takes a random choice hj = ±h at each site, one
instead gets subdiffusion, see Fig. 4. Long-range correlations of the Fibonacci potential are crucial for the observed diffusive transport. Such a discontinuous change
seems in fact to be a common property of quasiperiodic
potentials, it is for instance also observed50 for a cosine
potential in the AAH model, where it could not be explained by simple perturbation theory.
A simplistic picture could use Fermi’s golden rule on
perturbative interaction to argue for the diffusion. This
would predict the scattering rate due to small interaction
to scale as U 2 , which should be in turn reflected in the
scaling of D for small U . Simply using the scaling x ∼ tβ
between space and time would give the scattering length
diverging as ∼ 1/U 2β (note that we are neglecting any
fractality of matrix elements, which changes as a function
of h). Using the scaling ansatz23 j ∼ U 2β−ν f (L U 2β )
for the NESS current, where the scaling function must
have the asymptotics f (x  1) ∼ 1/x due to diffusion
for large L, and f (x  1) ∼ 1/xγ due to an anomalous non-interacting scaling j ∼ 1/Lγ for U → 0, gives
that the diffusion constant diverges as D ∼ 1/U ν with
ν = 2β(1 − γ). Using Eq. (13) one gets ν = 4(β − 12 ). In
Fig. 5(b) we can see that for small U diffusion constant
indeed diverges as D ∼ 1/U ν with the scaling exponent ν
increasing for decreasing h, and being roughly consistent
with the relation ν = 4(β− 21 ). To really confirm this relation however more data would be required. For larger h,
e.g. h ≥ 2, we would presumably need still smaller U to
see a clear power-law dependence with U (with a negative
ν). Namely, for potential amplitudes where the noninteracting case is subdiffusive we observe a nonmonotonous
dependence of D on U , with a maximum being reached
at a fairly small U ≈ 0.1 (see Table I as well as Fig. 15).
We would thus necessitate very small U to reveal small-

Figure 5. Dependence of the diffusion constant on h (top) and
U (bottom). (a) At fixed U , the diffusion constant has a power
law dependence on potential amplitude for the Fibonacci
model (red and green points), while it has an exponential

has a cosine potential (black squares, data from Ref. 50). Everything is plotted as a function of potential variance,

U behavior, in turn requiring very large systems. As a
function of h at fixed U (Fig. 5(a)) one has a power-law
dependence in the available range of h, D ∼ 1/hξ , with
the power ξ ≈ 3.3 for U = 0.1 (and slightly increasing
for smaller U ). This must be contrasted with the AAH
models where the dependence on h is exponential.
Comparing the cases of random, cosine-quasiperiodic,
and Fibonacci quasiperiodic potential one can say that
transport is the fastest in the Fibonacci model, then in
the AAH, while it is the slowest for random potential. All
quasiperiodic potentials are faster than random because
of long-range correlations in the potential (in a sense,
a quasiperiodic potential is “almost” periodic, in which
case one would have ballistic transport). That the Fibonacci is faster than the AAH can on the other hand be
ascribed to a broad momentum-spectrum of the potential67 .

Large interaction

So far we have found only diffusive transport. An important question is can one perhaps get a subdiffusive
transport at larger U ? After all, one of the reasons why
quasiperiodic potential is interesting is to clarify the influence of rare-regions that are argued to be responsible for subdiffusion in random potential19,38,39 , and, of
course, also from a fundamental desire to understand
under which circumstances can one get an anomalous
transport.
Let us say right away that the question of larger U
is very important and demands a careful separate study
– in this work we predominantly focus on small interactions. Namely, at larger U where one approaches a
possible phase transition into subdiffusion, numerics typically gets harder (first, relaxation gets longer because
the transport gets slower, and second, one also typically
needs fairly large χ). Here we therefore report only on a
situation for two sets of parameters.
Data for U = 0.5 and h = 2 is shown in Fig. 6.
Numerics is quite demanding, for instance, despite using χ = 300 in NESS simulations we could achieve only
about 5% accuracy in j for the largest L = 144. Data in
Fig. 6(a) is best fitted by j ∼ 1/L1.14 . Even taking into
account the mentioned ≈ 5% error we can with statistical significance say that the exponent γ is larger than
1 and one therefore has subdiffusion. Observe also that
for the same parameters, using random binary potential
(i.e., just reordering locations of +h and −h potential
from the Fibonacci to a random one) results in much
stronger subdiffusion. We remind that as far as localization is concerned, a binary disorder potential behaves
similarly80,81 as the more frequently studied one with a
box distribution. Further confidence that we are indeed
seeing subdiffusion is provided by unitary evolution of a
weakly polarized domain wall shown in Fig. 6(b). Here
one again needs large χ and one in particular needs to
increase χ for larger times, similarly as in NESS simulations where one has to use larger χ for larger L if one
wants to keep the accuracy constant. Having too small
χ will tend to push dynamics towards a (fake) diffusion,
see e.g. data for χ = 50 − 100 in Fig. 6(b). Too large
truncation due to small χ has a similar effects as classical
noise, e.g. dephasing, which will in the TDL always cause
diffusion regardless of whether one has interaction73,82 or
not83 . The best fitted exponent β ≈ 0.47 is consistent
via eq.(13) with the NESS 1/(1 + γ) ≈ 0.467. We also
observe that for times smaller than about t ≈ 300 the
dynamics is not yet the asymptotic one – the exponent
has clearly not yet converged – while at larger times we
converge to the same β < 0.5 regardless of time (we of
course can not exclude that at still larger times t  103
and L  144 one would eventually end up with diffusion,
however for L ≤ 144 and t < 800 we find no indications
of that).
Observing subdiffusion in a quasiperiodic potential
clearly shows that “rare-regions” can not serve as a uni-

versal “explanation” of subdiffusion. That this is so
should be clear also from the observed subdiffusion in
a non-interacting model for h > hdiff ≈ 1.6!
If, on the other hand, one takes smaller h = 1 and
the same interaction U = 0.5, Fig. 7, one instead of subdiffusion still sees diffusion. Because it is hard to distinguish marginal subdiffusion with γ being close to 1
from true diffusion γ = 1, we fit to the NESS current
data two curves each having two free parameters: one is
j ∼ a/L + b/L2 (theory for diffusion predicts71 finite-size
1/L2 correction), while the other is j ∼ a/Lb . One can
see (Fig. 7) that the first one fits better and therefore
we deem to still have diffusion (phase transition could
though be close to the point U = 0.5, h = 1). For
h = 1 and U = 1 the data we gathered for L ≤ 233
(not shown) also indicated the asymptotic diffusion with

Fully polarized domain wall

All unitary data on previous pages was for a weakly polarized mixed state domain wall with polarization m =
10−3 . While for a system without potential a fully polarized domain wall (DW) pure state
|DWi = |↑ · · · ↑↓ · · · ↓i,

(18)

is a special state and can not be used to infer (generic)
transport, this is not so for a model with nonzero hj like
our Fibonacci chain. We therefore check if the dynamics
of the DW leads to the same transport as that of a weakly
polarized mixed state domain wall (14), or of a driven
NESS. Using pure state tDMRG we evolve the state and
calculate the transfered magnetization ∆Z (17). In Fig. 8
we compare the results with those for a weakly polarized
domain wall. While we can not reach times longer than
about t ≈ 40 for pure-state evolution (despite having
χ ≈ 700) it seems that the growth of ∆Z(t) is similarly
diffusive as for a weakly polarized domain wall.
B.

Mean field dynamics

Let us now try to describe the dynamics of a fully polarized domain wall using a mean field treatment of the
interaction. Standard mean field treatment of a product of two operators AB neglects the term quadratic in
fluctuations, (A − hAi)(B − hBi), leading to a mean field
replacement AB → AhBi + hAiB. Doing that on the

observed diffusive dynamics that suggests itself is the following. We have an XX chain with a Fibonacci potential
and fluctuating magnetic fields. Provided the fluctuating magnetic field is Gaussian and uncorrelated in time
it is equivalent to a so-called dephasing Lindblad equation. That in turn, no matter how small is the dephasing,
in the thermodynamic limit always leads to diffusion83 .
However, as we show, such a “plausible” explanation of
the observed diffusion, is, in fact, wrong.
We shall show that by studying the mean field equations of motion. Although they fail to correctly describe dynamics in a quasiperiodic potential, an interesting open question is whether they can describe dynamics in some other situations, for instance, in a random
potential. Let us first write down equations of motion
for expectation values of observables in a noninteracting
model. Expanding density operator in terms of products
of Pauli operators,

corresponding expansion coefficients. Von Neumann
equation of motion for ρ(t) gives equations for the
expansion coefficients. Using Jordan-Wigner transformation all 2-point expectations of fermionic operators
form a closed set of equations. In spin language all
those expectation values can be compactly encoded
in a Hermitian correlation matrix Ci,k , with the offdiagonal matrix elements being Ci,k := (xz · · · zx +

where η comes from potential and is a diagonal matrix
with elements ηk,k = hk , while J represents hopping and
has nonzero elements only along the two next-diagonals,
Jk,k±1 = Jk±1,k = 1. Note that similar equations, only
with a non-Hermitian H, govern also Lindblad dynamics62 . For a fully polarized domain wall (18) the initial
condition is C(0) = −diag(1, . . . , 1, −1, . . . , −1).
One can obtain different mean field descriptions depending on fluctuations of which operators are neglected.
For our concrete interaction one can for instance work
directly with σkz , or, one can alternatively express σkz in
terms of raising and lowering operators, like σk− σk+ =
(1 − σkz )/2 and σk+ σk− = (1 + σkz )/2, and neglect fluctuations of those. Denoting for later reference the two mean

In version (a) the mean field equations (20) therefore
get an additional term −i U2 [C, Cd ], with the diagonal

In case (b) one has a similar terms plus an additional
i U4 [C, Co ], where Co is equal to two 1st off-diagonals of
C.
In both cases equations become nonlinear and their
behavior has to be analysed numerically. We did that
by integrating them, starting with a DW initial condition, and averaging over all L + 1 different Fibonacci
sequences. Results are shown in Fig. 9. We can see that
while the mean field description might look promising at
short times (e.g., dashed mean-field curves might seem to
follow exact diffusive dynamics up to t ≈ 20), at longer
times mean-field is subdiffusive rather than diffusive. We

10
We note that in Ref. 84 the method used (called a selfconsistent Hartree-Fock method) is essentially the same
as the mean field version (b), Eq. (23). At stronger
quasiperiodic potential and strong U they find, differently than us at small U , that the above mean-field description leads to faster than subdiffusive relaxation. The
applicability of the mean-field equations (20,21,23) needs
to be studied in more detail.

Figure 9. Comparing two mean field variants, listed under
(a) and (b) in the text, for a fully polarized domain wall
in the Fibonacci chain. For comparison, we also show exact
diffusive dynamics of a weakly polarized domain wall (labeled
by dw) for U = 0.5, h = 0.6. Mean field asymptotically always
incorrectly leads to subdiffusion. All data is for L = 233 such
that there are no finite-size effects.

Figure 10. Mean field protocol (a) for L = 233 and h = 0.6
for a binary-disordered chain. Upon introducing interactions,
the erstwhile localized system starts transporting spin fluctuations; for the present case U = 0.5 the transport is subdiffusive as indicated by the straight line fit.

therefore must conclude that the mean field treatment
can not explain the observed diffusive transport in the Fibonacci model at small U . Interactions at the mean-field
level in fact always slow down transport irrespective of
h value. This is manifestly untrue for the exact interacting dynamics where we have seen that interactions either
“enhance” noninteracting subdiffusive transport to diffusion or “degrade” noninteracting superdiffusive transport
to diffusion. However in the case of binary disorder, there
is no magnetization transfer in the absence of interactions
due to Anderson localization; adding interactions at the
mean-field level results in subdiffusive transport for the
parameters chosen in Fig. 10. Moreover we notice that
the dynamical exponent in the presence of mean-field interactions is about the same for both types of disorder
at a given U, h combination (Fig. 9 and 10). From this
we conclude that a mean-field treatment is insufficient to
discriminate the two types of disorder.

V.

CONCLUSIONS

Localization can be attributed to the physics of detuning between the strengths of off-diagonal to diagonal
matrix elements in a local basis, whether in a random or
quasiperiodic system45 . Strong spatial correlations of the
potential in the Fibonacci model prevent any detuningcaused localization in the non-interacting system at finite
potential strength h. Upon introducing weak interactions
we find no many-body localized phase and the transport of spin fluctuations becomes diffusive, β = 12 , bearing no remnant of the spectral-fractality induced anomalous transport in the non-interacting limit. This latter
aspect might be surprising as it suggests that already
a small coherent interaction is sufficient to wash out
multifractality-induced anomalous diffusion in the noninteracting limit (noting that mean-field analysis suggests
that multifractality should still persist in the Fibonacci
model with weak interactions85 ). Diffusive transport in
the Fibonacci system must be contrasted with the binary
disorder case, where there are no spatial correlations, and
which shows instead a subdiffusive dynamics at the same
field-strengths.
In this regard, there are two key differences here from
the widely studied interacting-AAH model that make the
interacting Fibonacci model interesting and worth pursuing further: Firstly, the resulting diffusion constant decays only algebraically with field strength as opposed to
the Aubry-Andre-Harper model50 where there is an exponential decay. Qualitatively, this is in line with the
understanding that the cosine quasiperiodic potential is
less correlated than the Fibonacci one, as reflected for
instance in the existence of a non-interacting localization transition, and therefore shows slower transport,
albeit being diffusive in both cases. However the precise reasons for this difference needs to be understood
more quantitatively and is an interesting, open question. Secondly, whereas the Fermi’s golden rule estimate
ν = 4(β − 12 ) for the diffusion constant scaling D ∼ U −ν
for weak interactions U gives a reasonable quantitative
agreement with numerics, this estimate fails in the AAH
model50 . On a similar note, mean-field analysis also
suggests stronger discontinuity of spectral multifractality in the AAH model upon introducing weak interactions85 . These points suggest that the Fibonacci model is
likely amenable to a more refined perturbative treatment
for understanding its transport and (if any) localization
properties.

Special care is dedicated to demonstrate a quantitative agreement between transport extracted from unitary
dynamics of polarized domain walls or from boundarydriven Lindblad equation steady states, lending credence
to our finding. We also show that mean-field analysis
is unable to account for diffusion in the quasiperiodic
model.
Finally, at larger interaction strength U = 0.5 and
h = 2, we found a regime in parameter space where
on available times t ∼ 800 and system sizes L ∼ 144
weak subdiffusive dynamics occurs. This finding, grossly
agreeing with recent work56 , is surprising: firstly, because the system is far away from the noninteracting
limit such that multifractal effects of eigenfunctions and
spectrum (which resulted in anomalous transport in the
noninteracting limit66 ) should not play a role here, and
secondly because there are no rare-regions which typically are invoked to account for subdiffusive transport19 .
The full explanation of this effect requires further elucidation, starting with uncovering a possible similar effect
in the interacting Aubry-Andre-Harper model by exploring a larger portion of its parameter space.

1000 and h = 3 for domain wall initial conditions with each
curve averaged over different number of samples as indicated.

Appendix A: Finite size effects and log-periodic
oscillations in the free system

In the main text we showed data from L = 8001 for a
single sample. Here we show that there are no finite size
effects by going to smaller system sizes or ensemble averaging i.e. the average asymptotic growth may be reliably
computed from a single sample in a large L system. In
Fig. 11 we display the dynamics for a wavepacket spreading from a central site for L = 8001, 4001, 1001. We see
that they nicely follow each other (before finite-L saturation sets in), and that the dynamical exponent may be
unambiguously determined.
However around the average algebraic growth (whether
for wavepacket spreading or transferred magnetization,
as we see in Fig. 11 and Fig. 2), there are oscillations
around this anomalous dynamics especially at larger h
values. These oscillations result from the self-similar hierarchy developing in the profiles (see Fig. 12) which in
turn arise from the spectral fractality and the subsequent
oscillatory transferring of wavefunction weight between
different peaks for the wavepacket spreading86–90 .
For the domain wall spreading, we find a similar story;
see bottom panel of Fig. 12. There we see a hierarchi-

cal development of mini domain-walls along the chain,
causing recurring magnetization fluctuations along these
new domain walls, resulting in oscillations in the dynamics. However due to the bulk nature of the initial excitations (requiring that excess magnetization be transferred
across half-chain lengths in order for a true reversal or
oscillation in the dynamics), these oscillations are significantly weaker here than in the wavepacket spreading.

Appendix B: Further NESS data and the
convergence with the MPO bond dimension

In Fig. 13 we show data for the NESS current, from
which by fitting 1/L dependence we extract the NESS
diffusion constant DNESS (Table I).
As mentioned, we always check convergence with the
MPO bond dimension χ. Typically the NESS current j
decreases as one increases χ, with a finite-χ correction
scaling in most cases as 1/χ. In cases where the required
χ in order to get precision of order (few) percent would
be prohibitively large we therefore use extrapolation in

Figure 12. Top panel: The wavefunction amplitudes across
the middle half of the chain at the indicated fixed times for
L = 4001 chain at h = 4. As time increases, we see that
the wavefunction peak splits into two, developing a hierarchy;
this self-similar hierarchy (entailing back and forth motion)
is reflected in the above oscillations. Bottom panel: Magnetization profiles of domain-wall in the noninteracting L = 1000
system at fixed times with h = 0.6 and a single sample. Here
too we see a self-similar hierarchy developing in the profiles.

1/χ in order to get closer to a true j. This is shown in
Fig. 14. One can see that a finite χ introduces an additional “truncation noise” that makes transport faster,
i.e., increases j.
In Fig. 15 we show the dependence of j on interaction
for a fixed L and h ≥ 2 where the noninteracting system
is subdiffusive. We can see that the current initially, expectedly, increases with U , reaching a maximum around
U ≈ 0.1. Such small value of the maximum prevents us
to explore more in detail a conjectured power-law dependence at small U , that is to extract the scaling exponent
ν for h ≥ 2.

Figure 14. Convergence of NESS current j with MPO bond
dimension χ. We show one (typical) case of nice convergence
for U = 0.2, h = 3 and L = 55 (blue color, right axis), and
one case of less nice convergence obtained for U = 0.2, h = 2
and L = 144 (red color, left axis). Dashed lines show the used
extrapolation to χ → ∞.

Appendix C: Additional unitary data

In Fig. 16 we show data for different χ and unitary
evolution of a weakly polarized domain wall (14). We
can see that the convergence of Dunit is similarly ∼ 1/χ
as for the NESS setting.
In Fig. 17 we show data for different L and therefore
different Fibonacci sequence realizations. While at short
times there is understandably a difference between realizations (red and green data in Fig. 17), at longer times
diffusion becomes “self-averaging” with very little difference between different Fibonacci sequence realizations.

Figure 15. Scaled NESS current for L = 55 and h = 2 (red,
left axis), and h = 3 (blue, right axis). For both values of h
one has subdiffusion at U = 0. As a function of interaction U
one has a non-monotonous dependence.

Figure 16. Convergence with χ for unitary evolution of a
weakly polarized domain wall. The inset shows the convergence of Dunit (obtained by fitting (4Dunit t/π)1/2 to each
curve for t ∈ [400, 1200]). All is for U = 0.2, h = 2, and
L = 144 (one Fibonacci sequence).

This is also a reason that we typically do not have to do
any averaging. Comparing h = 1 (Fig. 17) and h = 2
(Fig. 16), the absolute size of finite-χ correction is about
the same (about ≈ 0.03 at χ = 200), however, the relative error is for h = 1 almost 10 times smaller than for
h = 2 simply because of larger Dunit . This means that
smaller χ suffices at h = 1 for the same relative precision of Dunit . This is the reason we could afford to go
to t = 2000 and L = 987 for smaller h = 1, and why
on the other hand simulations for larger h are more time
consuming.

We could afford to use χ ≤ 300 (in few cases, e.g. NESS
for U = 0.2, h = 2, even χ = 400, or χ = 500 for unitary
U = 0.5, h = 2). Beware that a mixed state evolution
using tDMRG is about 8 times costlier than a pure state
evolution (each short time-step involves a SVD of a 4χ×4χ
matrix instead of a 2χ×2χ). The total CPU computational
time for all the data gathered was more than 106 corehours!

It makes sense to speak about tranport type only in the
limit of t → ∞, or L → ∞ for the NESS setting. Only
in such limit can one unambgiously distinguish different
scalings ∼ tα .

The claim made in Ref. 77 about superdiffusion for small
h as well as for small U , based on short and narrow range
of times (note that the relevant parameter is the number
of scattering events U 2 t, so a priori taking just smaller U
does not help), are both incorrect, as well as the statement
that there is no finite region of parameters with diffusion.
In fact, it is the opposite, one always has diffusion, see
Ref. 50 for correct statements.
