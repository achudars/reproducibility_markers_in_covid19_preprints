The large-area violet-light-sensitive silicon photodiode PIN is one of the candidates of the lead
tungstate crystal detector readout component of the photon spectrometer in the large heavy ion
collision experiment. The PIN diode was assembled with the lead tungstate crystal and the low-noise
preamplifier into a complete detector unit. The beam test was carried out on the SPS accelerator
at CERN. The energy resolution was measured with the electron beam energy ranging from 5 to 40
GeV. The summation correction method was discussed, and an excellent linearity of the nominal
beam energy versus the peak position of the detector was obtained, which showed the punch-through
effect can be ignored.

INTRODUCTION

ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) [1] is an
experiment at the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) optimized for the study of heavy-ion collisions, at a centreof-mass energy about 5.5 TeV. The prime aim of the experiment is to study in detail the behaviour of matter at
high densities and temperatures, in view of probing deconfinement and chiral-symmetry restoration. The major technical challenge to the experiment is imposed by
the large number of particles created in the collisions of
lead ions. There is a considerable spread in the currently
available predictions for the multiplicity of charged particles produced in a central Pb-Pb collision. The detector
consists essentially of two main components: the central
part, composed of detectors mainly devoted to the study
of hadronic signals and dielectrons in the pseudorapidity
range −1 < η < 1, and the forward muon spectrometer,
devoted to the study of quarkonia behaviour in dense
matter.
The central part of the ALICE detector also includes an electromagnetic calorimeter, PHOS (PHOton
Spectrometer)[2], devoted to the study of photon signals.
It is positioned on the bottom of the ALICE set-up, and
covers approximately a quarter of a unit in pseudorapidity, −0.12 ≤ η ≤ 0.12, and 100 in azimuthal angle. The PHOS electromagnetic calorimeter is optimized
for measuring photons (of 0.5-10 GeV/c), π 0 ’s (of 1-10
GeV/c) and η mesons (of 2-10 GeV/c). Measurement of
higher momenta particles will also be feasible, although
not with optimal energy resolution. PHOS is consists
of 17280 detecting channels of lead-tungstate crystals,
PWO (PbWO4 ), of 2.2×2.2×18 cm3 dimensions, coupled

to large-area PIN-diodes with low-noise preamplifiers.
The PIN diode and APD (avalanche photodiode) are
designed as two candidates of the readout unit of PWO
crystal in PHOS. The PIN diode has better linearity with
large sensitive area, while the APD has higher transmission gain with small area.
PIN diode is a kind of large-area, thick depleted depth
silicon photodiode, which can convert photons into electrons. Different PIN diode has different size and character. So, it has a wide range of applications[3–7], such
as photon detecting, X-ray detecting, -ray detecting, microwave, antenna, mobile, radiotherapy, and scientific research et al.
The Chinese PIN diode was developed by CIAE (China
Institute of Atomic Energy) and Peking university [8]. It
has a large sensitive area of 16 x 17 mm2 , the junction
capacitance is 110-120 pf when it is fully depleted, the
leak current at room temperature is less than 5 nA, and
the quantum efficiency in the violet light region (400-500
nm) is about 82%. The noise of PIN+preamplifier is less
than 527 ENC (equivalent noise charge) at -25.
After the offline basic tests of the main performance of
Chinese PINs, they were taken to CERN and assembled
into a complete PHOS detector unit (PWO + PIN +
Preamplifier) to perform the beam test.

BEAM TEST

The PIN diode connecting with the preamplifier is
bonded to the bottom of the PWO using silica gel, so
that the contact is good enough without bubbles, thus
forming a complete detector unit. 25 detector units are
arranged into a 5x5 detector matrix. As a comparison,
the 3x3 small matrix in the upper left corner are Norwegian PIN samples marked with *, as shown in Figure
1. The detector matrix is placed in the low temperature environment of -25, and installed on the movable

γγ... → ... ). The electrons and photons will be finally
converted to fluorescences in the crystal, and then the
fluorescences are converted to electrical signals in PIN.
In fact, due to the limit of crystal geometry size, some
electrons or -rays of the shower may pass through the
crystal when a high-energy electron hits on the detector.
If the shower particles pass through the crystal longitudinally, they will enter the PIN diode. Because the PIN
diode is not only sensitive to photons, but also very sensitive to charged particles, it will cause the distortion of
the output signal, this is so-called the punch-through effect. If the shower particles pass through the side of the
central crystal and enter other crystals around, the amplitude of the real signal will be reduced, which can be
corrected by a summation method:

platform of X5 beam line of SPS accelerator. Each detector unit can be located to the beam spot by remote
adjusting along X and Y directions, so the experimental
measurement can be carried out.
The electron beam provided by the SPS accelerator
hits the PWO crystal of the detector, and fluorescences
are produced by electromagnetic shower in PWO, then
they are converted into photoelectrons by PIN. The electrical signals output by the preamplifier are sent to the
forming amplifier, and then sent to the ADC. At the same
time, a trigger signal given by the logic combination of
the trigger detector signals is sent to the ADC to open
the ADC gate. The information of the ADC and the
trigger register signal in another CAMAC crate are both
recorded by a multi-parameter acquisition system. The
DAQ system ’CASCADE’ is consists of CAMAC, VME,
SCI high-speed transmission line and a computer with
PCI card. The DAQ PC is working with PAW interface
in Linux system. And the temperature of the detector
matrix is continuously monitored on a separate control
PC. All information is recorded on an event-by-event basis and written to tapes for offline analysis.
The main purpose of the experiment is to measure the
energy resolution of the detector unit in a wide range of
energy using the SPS electron beam. The experiment is
arranged as follows:
(1) The 5x5 detector units are scaned respectively by
a 20 GeV electron beam for energy calibration.
(2) The central detector of each 3x3 small matrix is
scanned by electron beam with different energy from 5
to 40 GeV. Among them, the central detector of No.7 is
measured in detail with more energy points, and others
with less points.

DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULTS

In an ideal case, each detector of the photon spectrometer is an independent detector unit: the incident electrons produce showers in the crystal (e− → γ → e− e+ →

Where Ac is the signal amplitude generated by an event
in the central detector, Ai is the signal amplitude caused
by the same event in the detector around it, and Ac,sum
is the corrected central detector signal. Where ηi,c is
the sum-factor, which is the ratio of peak position of the
central detector with other detector around caused by
the scaning electron beam with the same energy.
The sum-number should be determined according to
the actual situation of the experimental setup. If the
sum-number is too small, some useful signal will be lost,
while if the sum-number is too large and too much noise
will be introduced, the energy resolution will also be reduced. The usual sum-number is as follow:
(1) Sum(1=center): only the single central detector is
used.
(2) Sum(5=1+4): the central detector and the upper,
lower, left and right detectors.
(3) Sum(9=3x3): the 3x3 matrix around the central
detector.
(4) Sum(25=5x5): the 5x5 matrix around the central
detector.
Experimental data analysis shows that the corrected
energy peak position increases and tends to a saturation
value with the increase of the sum-number, and the width
of the peak changes as well. Thus, the energy resolution
is varying with the sum-number too. If the beam energy
is higher, the sum-number should be bigger in order to
get a better energy resolution. As it is shown in Figure
2.
Normally, the correction method with sum(3x3) or
sum(1+4) is the best choice in the experimental energy
range.
The achieved linearity curve, i.e. the nominal beam energy versus the peak position, in ADC channels, is shown
in Figure 3. As can be seen from this figure, the response
of the detector matrix is linear in a wide energy range 540 GeV. The adj. R-square of linear fit is 0.99996. The

result of the excellent linearity of the response of detector shows that the distortion of the signal caused by the
punch-through effect is very small in the energy range.
So, the punch-through effect can be ignored.

Where the energy E is in GeV, a represents the electronic noise, b represents the stochastic term and c represents the constant term. The noise term a includes
contributions from preamplifier noise, digitization noise
and, in principle, pile-up noise, the latter was negligible
in our tests. The stochastic term b takes into account the
fluctuations in the electromagnetic showers and the variations due to photon statistics. The constant term c takes
into account shower leakage at the back end of the crystals, intercalibration errors, non-uniformity in the light
collection and geometrical effects.
We have tested several 3x3 small matrixs with det7,
det13, det17 and det19 (with Norwegian PINs) as the
center respectively. Table I shows the energy resolution

Figure 4 shows the energy resolution curve versus energy of the central det7 3x3 matrix. In general, the energy resolution decreases while the energy increase. The

netic shower into the surrounding detectors, to obtain the
true energy peak and better energy resolution, the corrected method of summation was used. The data analysis
shows that the correction of sum(3x3) or sum(1+4) is the
best choice in the experimental energy range.
The excellent linearity of the nominal beam energy versus the peak position of the detector shows that the distortion of the signal caused by the punch-through effect
is negligible.
An energy resolution comparison of each central unit
at E = 20 GeV is given. It shows that the detector energy
resolution with Chines PINs is equal to or a litter better
than that with Norwegian PINs.
