ABSTRACT
Here we present the analysis of multi-epoch secondary eclipse observations of HD 189733b and HD 209458b
as a probe of temporal variability in the planetary climate using both Spitzer channels 1 and 2 (3.6 and 4.5 µm).
We expect hot Jupiter atmospheres to be dynamic environments exhibiting time varying weather. However, it is
uncertain to what extent temporal variability will be observable when considering disc integrated observations.
We do not detect statistically significant variability and are able to place useful upper limits on the IR variability
amplitudes in these atmospheres. There are very few planets with multi-epoch observations at the required
precision to probe variability in dayside emission. The observations considered in this study span several
years, providing insight into temporal variability at multiple timescales. In the case of HD 189733b, the best fit
eclipse depths for the channel 2 observations exhibit a scatter of 102 ppm about a median depth of 1827 ppm
and in channel 1 exhibit a scatter of 88 ppm about a median depth of 1481 ppm. For HD 209458b, the best fit
eclipse depths for the channel 2 observations exhibit a scatter of 22 ppm about a median depth of 1406 ppm
and in channel 1 exhibit a scatter of 131 ppm about a median depth of 1092 ppm. The precision and scatter
in these observations allow us to constrain variability to less than (5.6% and 6.0%) and (12% and 1.6%) for
channels (1,2) of HD 189733b and HD 209458b respectively.

1. INTRODUCTION

Studying exoplanet atmospheres is challenging since we often are not able to spatially resolve them. They are typically
too faint to disentangle their light from that of their much
brighter host star. Transiting exoplanets provide a unique opportunity to study exoplanet atmospheres in spite of this challenge. Disc integrated secondary eclipse observations provide
valuable information on temperature, albedo, and chemical
composition averaged over the entire hemisphere. Primary
transits give a limb averaged atmospheric molecular spectrum
and pressure - temperature profile. However, we must employ other novel techniques to begin to probe physical and
chemical processes and structures at smaller scales. Temporal variability is one way to probe weather features and their
their movements without spatially resolving them. Variability is also a tool to study portions of the atmosphere inaccessible via other observational techniques. Transmission spectroscopy observations in the near infrared typically probe millibar pressure levels high in the atmosphere. Processes deeper
in the atmosphere are obscured due to the long path lengths of
the transit geometry. Time varying changes in emission may
be indicative of processes occurring deeper in the atmosphere
that are, otherwise, unobservable with current methods and
insturments.

Close-in giant planets (hot Jupiters) are interesting objects
with which to study atmospheric dynamics. They are assumed
to be tidally locked based on their short orbital periods (<5
days) and minimal separation from their host stars. As a result, they experience a constant radiative forcing on their permanent dayside. The combination of the rotation rate and radiative forcing of these planets are predicted to produce large
scale weather structures unlike anything in our solar system.
There have been many efforts to model the circulation and
temperature structure of hot Jupiters with many of these efforts based on the properties of the two most well studied
targets, HD 189733b and HD 209458b (HD 189733b& HD
209). Simulations by Showman & Guillot (2002); Cho et al.
(2003) and Menou et al. (2003) predicted that the Rossby deformation radius and Rhines scale of hot Jupiters should be
comparable to the planetary radius resulting in atmospheric
dynamics comprised of a few jets and large scale polar vortices. They predicted that vortices would be large enough that
their migration could have an affect on the observed eclipse
depth. ? demonstrated that, based on those model predictions, changes in eclipse depth as great as 20% could be observed. Later simulations by Showman et al. (2009) predicted
far more stable atmospheric structures. Variability was predicted to be less than several percent for HD 189733b at 8 µm
and the result of wave dynamics deep in the atmosphere rather

2

Kilpatrick et al.

than migrating vortices.
Agol et al. (2010a) observationally probed model predictions with a multi - epoch set of transit and eclipse observations of HD 189733b at 8 µm. The results of that work placed
an upper limit on eclipse depth variability at 2.7%, effectively
ruling out larger predictions. There have been few other attempts to study temporal variability due to the lack of multiple
observations over a sufficient temporal baseline.
We choose as our targets for this study HD 189733b and
HD 209458b both because of their suitability for observations
with the Spitzer observatory and because they are the only targets with a large number of observations with a single instrument spanning a number of years. These two planets are the
most well studied and characterized exoplanets to date. Both
orbit bright stars, Kmag of 5.5 and 6.3 for HD 189733b and
HD 209458b respectively, making them ideal targets for characterization and have previously observed secondary eclipse
depths >1000 ppm in both warm Spitzer channels 1 and 2.
HD 189733b is arguably the most thoroughly studied exoplanet. It has been observed with photometric (e.g. Ehrenreich et al. 2007; Désert et al. 2009, 2011b) and spectroscopic (e.g. Gibson et al. 2012) transits as well as secondary
eclipse (e.g. Charbonneau et al. 2008a; Agol et al. 2010a) and
phase curve (Knutson et al. 2007, 2009, 2012) observations
across a multitude of wavelengths. In addition to full orbit
phase curves at multiple wavelengths, it is the only planet to
have been mapped via the eclipse mapping technique (Majeau et al. 2012; de Wit et al. 2012; Rauscher et al. 2018). HD
209458b was the first transiting exoplanet discovered (Charbonneau et al. 2000). It has also been observed in both transit and eclipse geometries photometrically (e.g. Charbonneau
et al. 2008b; Diamond-Lowe et al. 2014) and spectroscopically (e.g. Deming et al. 2013; Line et al. 2016) , as well as
full orbit phase curve observations (Zellem et al. 2014).
The large amount of observational and theoretical effort invested into these two canonical hot Jupiters make them perfect
choices for a study of this nature. There are eclipse observations from multiple programs spanning years from which to
build the necessary temporal baseline. Additionally, their orbital properties are well studied and well constrained allowing
for the detection of small signals in their lightcurves due to
planetary thermal structure that can be clearly distinguished
from other potential sources such as orbital eccentricity.
Understanding variability will be essential in current and
future attempts to leverage multiple epoch observations to
build precision for high resolution techniques. When stacking observations, whether it be transmission spectroscopy or
emission photometry, one makes the assumption that each observation is an independent measurement of a constant signal.
Showing that any temporal variability is below the level of
precision of your observations allows them to be combined in
analysis. If this set of Spitzer observations are not sensitive
to temporal variability they can be combined to achieve the
precision necessary to perform eclipse mapping.
Eclipse mapping (Majeau et al. 2012; de Wit et al. 2012)
uses the deviations to the shape of ingress and egress caused
by a non uniform dayside temperature distribution to create
two dimensional thermal maps. In general, one needs ∼10
points over the ingress/egress with a precision of at least a
tenth of the eclipse depth to achieve the necessary resolution
to map hot Jupiters. The only way to achieve that precision
with current observatories is to stack multiple observations.
In the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) era, observing
time will be expensive and full orbit phase curves may prove

too costly. However, mapping may be done much more efficiently with as little as two eclipse observations. Understanding temporal variability then is crucial in knowing if stacking
multi-epoch observations is justifiable in that context. The
observations considered here give the best current insight into
orbit to orbit changes in hot Jupiter atmospheres.
2. OBSERVATIONS

Here we consider all existing secondary eclipse observations of HD 189733b and HD 209458b in channels 1 and 2
(3.6 or 4.5 µm bandpass) . The observations analyzed here
are part of Programs 60021 (PI: H. Knutson), 10103 (PI: N.
Lewis), 90186 (PI: K. Todorov), and 70100 (PI: M. Swain).
The details of each Astronomical Observing Request (AOR)
are displayed in Table 1 and 2. All of the observations were
carried out in sub-array mode (32×32 pixels, 39”×39”). Observations in Program 10103 utilize a 30 minute peak-up observation preceding them to stabilize the image on the detector ‘sweet spot’ and decreases the likelihood of a ramp in the
data (Ingalls et al. 2012). Program 60021 observations are full
orbit phase curves from which we extract the AORs containing the eclipse from the larger data set. Both HD 189733 and
HD 209458 are bright targets with Kmag of 5.5 and 6.3 respectively. As a result, frame times for all of the observations are
0.1 seconds. The two exceptions are the observations of HD
209458b in channel 2 that were conducted with a 0.4 second
frame time and the observations of HD 189733b from program 70100 that were conducted such that the stellar centroid
was near the corner of the pixel so that a longer (0.4 s) exposure time could be used. This technique proved problematic
in that the systematics were not easily corrected with existing
techniques and, as a result, several of these observations were
discarded from this study.
3. DATA ANALYSIS METHODS

3.1. Photometric Extraction
For each AOR we began with Basic Calibrated Data (BCD)
available on the Spitzer Heritage Archive. Each BCD file contains a cube of 64 frames of 64 × 64 pixels. Each set of 64
images comes as a single FITS file with a time stamp corresponding to the start of the first image. We determine the time
of each frame in the set by adding the appropriate multiple
of the frame time to the time stamp of the first image. Each
frame was corrected for bad pixels or NaN values by masking the invalid pixels. Each frame is background subtracted
based on the median pixel value outside of a 10 x 10 pixel box
around the stellar centroid. Pixel values in the background region that deviate from the mean by more than 5 σ are clipped
and the median value remaining is taken to be the background.
Stellar centroid positions for each frame are determined by a
first moment center of mass calculation:
P

j,k (I jk j)
j,k (I jk k)
xcen = P

ycen = P

We perform two-dimensional Gaussian Centroiding as well
but find the first moment calculation to be more stable and
provides less scatter in the extracted photometry.
The noise pixel parameter (β̃) (Lewis et al. 2013; Kilpatrick
et al. 2017) is calculated for each frame as

known as Gaussian Kernel Regression with data (Lewis et al.
2013) and Pixel Level Decorrelation (PLD) (Deming et al.
2015).
Each eclipse fit was based on the model of Mandel & Agol
(2002) for a uniform occultation implemented in python by
the BATMAN package (Kreidberg 2015). The orbital, stellar,
and planetary parameters listed in table 3 were used as input
fixed parameters to the model. Spitzer IRAC data is known to
have an exponential ramp in flux over the first 30–60 minutes
of observing; however the peak-up technique has alleviated
this problem to some extent (Kilpatrick et al. 2017; Ingalls
et al. 2012). As a precaution, each data set was fit in several ways: without alteration, trimmed at 20 minutes from the
beginning of the observation, and with an exponential ramp
model of the form

where each Pi is the response measured in each pixel across
the frame. We also save the 5 x 5 array of background subtracted pixel values about the stellar centroid for each frame.
Each array is normalized such that they sum to one. We then
perform aperture photometry about the stellar centroid using
the aperture_photometry function from the Astropy package
Photutils. Circular apertures of fixed radii ranging from 1.8
- 2.8 pixels and variable radii apertures ranging from βpix ×
{0.7...1.2} and βpix + {-0.6...1.4}. The resultant time series
photometry is then filtered by removing any points that deviate by more than 3 σ from the median values of flux or x,y
position.
3.2. Systematics Correction and Model Fitting
The intrapixel sensitivity variation (Ingalls et al. 2012), the
change in measured flux as a function of stellar centroid position and methods of correction, are well documented (e.g.
Ingalls et al. 2016; Kilpatrick et al. 2017). Here, we employ
two independent methods of correction for this systematic
variation; the Nearest Neighbors method (NNBR), otherwise

where the P̂it ’s are the response of the ith pixel in a 3 × 3
grid around the centroid of the image and DE(t) is the eclipse
model and ∆St is the total flux, including the astrophysical
signal and all systematics, at each time t.
For each AOR the eclipse model and systematics model
were combined and best fit values for all free parameters were
determined using a non-linear, least squares fitting algorithm.
The standard deviation of the normalized residuals (SDNR)
was used as a metric for selecting the best fit out of the 30
different apertures for each AOR. The Bayesian Information
Criterion (BIC) was used to determine the appropriate treatment between various trimming and ramp model options. We
find that no trimming or exponential ramp are necessary in
all cases of Channel 2 observations and the quadratic ramp
with PLD is favored in all Channel 1 observations. The results from the best fit aperture were passed to a Markov Chain
Monte Carlo implemented by emcee (Foreman-Mackey et al.
2013) to derive uncertainties of each free parameter. We use
a number of walkers at least twice the number of free parameters and run for 105 steps per walker before testing for convergence using Gelman Rubin statistics with a threshold for
acceptance of 1.01 (Gelman & Rubin 1992).
4. RESULTS

Here we present the best fit eclipse depths and center of
eclipse times, along with their corresponding uncertainty, for
each of the observations. The results presented in Table 4
are derived using the PLD method with a quadratic temporal
term. No additional trimming or ramps are modeled. The best
fit aperture was consistently a fixed radius aperture between
2.2 and 2.4 pixels. We include in Table 4 the standard deviation of the normalized residuals (SDNR) and the βred factor,
as defined in Gillon et al. (2010), as a measure of correlated
noise remaining in the data after systematic corrections. Included in Figure 1 are representative fits for each of the two
targets in each of the two channels with the systematics removed and binned at two minute intervals. In the case of HD
189733b, the best fit eclipse depths for the channel 2 observations exhibit a scatter of 102 ppm about a median depth of

1827 ppm and in channel 1 exhibit a scatter of 88 ppm about
a median depth of 1481 ppm. For HD 209458b, the best fit
eclipse depths for the channel 2 observations exhibit a scatter
of 22 ppm about a median depth of 1406 ppm and in channel
1 exhibit a scatter of 131 ppm about a median depth of 1092
ppm.
As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the scatter in the data is consistent with the uncertainty in each measurement in all cases
except for the channel 1 HD209 data. Given the number of
observations at the achieved precision, we would expect the
resultant eclipse depths to represent a sampling of a distribution represented by the shaded areas in Figures 2 and 3. The
channel 1 observations of HD209, which exhibit more scatter
than indicated by the error bars, is thought to be due to unresolved systematics. This is further supported by the larger values of βred in channel 1 observations in comparison to channel
2.
4.1. Constraints on Temporal Variability
As a probe of periodic variability in the eclipse depths we
calculate the absolute difference in eclipse depths for each
pair of observations. The absolute difference is plotted against
the time between observations. Small numbers of observations do not lend themselves to more thorough methods of
detecting power at certain time scales such as Lomb-Scargle
periodograms, however, this simple approach would show a
spike in absolute difference at any relevant timescale. The
apparent random scatter of the data points in Figure 4 does
not indicate any periodic structure in any of the observations.
Given that we find no evidence for variability in our observations we compare the standard deviation and the magnitude of
the eclipse depths to constrain variability to less than (5.6%
and 6.0%) and (12% and 1.6%) for channels (1,2) of HD
189733b and HD 209458b respectively. We synthesized a periodic signal over a grid of varying periods and amplitudes to
demonstrate that our observations would be sensitive to variability above the levels of our constraint. We then simulated
measurements using the relevant uncertainty at each of the
observation times. We evaluate the delta BIC for a constant
signal versus a periodic signal at each grid point averaged over
100 trials. We find that the detection threshold is not sensitive
to period over the timescales probed by these observations;

after which it increases rapidly with signal amplitude. This
metric provides evidence that if a signal were present our observations would be sensitive to it.
4.2. Stellar Variability
Stellar variability in the form of spots or plages can affect the measured planetary transit signal, potentially altering
one’s interpretation of its atmospheric composition, particularly for bright targets with large transit signals (Pont et al.
2008; Silva-Valio 2008; Czesla et al. 2009; Wolter et al. 2009;
Agol et al. 2010b; Berta et al. 2011; Carter et al. 2011; Désert
et al. 2011a; Sing et al. 2011; Fraine et al. 2014; McCullough et al. 2014; Oshagh et al. 2014; Damasso et al. 2015;

2018). HD 189733 is an active K0 star which has been observed to vary by as much as ± 1.5% at visible wavelengths
with a rotation period of 11.95 days (Knutson et al. 2012, and

references within) whose variability potentially impacts the
observed transit depth of the planet (McCullough et al. 2014;
Knutson et al. 2012). Although the amplitudes of these variations are reduced as our Spitzer/IRAC observations are in
the infrared (Oshagh et al. 2014; Rackham et al. 2017; Morris
et al. 2018) and of eclipses (Zellem et al. 2017), we examine
the amplitude of these changes in comparison to the scatter
and uncertainty in our eclipse depth measurements.
We employ ground-based monitoring spanning the 2009 to
2014 observing seasons with the Tennessee State University
0.8 m Automated Photoelectric Telescope (APT) at Fairborn
Observatory in southern Arizona (e.g., Henry 1999; Eaton
et al. 2003, Fig. 5). However, most of our Spitzer /IRAC observations occur outside the APT observing season (Fig. 5).
While previous studies have interpolated APT monitoring to
their Spitzer observations (Knutson et al. 2012) using an activity model (Aigrain et al. 2012) to fit the APT data and interpolated it to their Spitzer observations, we conservatively
take the peak-to-trough Strömgren b+y variability observed
by APT from 2009 to 2014 (4.7%) and interpolate it to the
infrared using the scaling presented in Knutson et al. (2012)
(1.6%). Using Equation 7 in Zellem et al. (2017), we estimate

5. DISCUSSION
5.1. Model Predictions
Given that our assessment of atmospheric variability is
in direct relation to the planet’s atmospheric dynamics, we
compare our Spitzer variability estimates to predictions from
three-dimensional general circulation models (GCMs). In
particular, we use GCM simulations of HD 189733b from
Showman et al. (2009) and HD 209458b from Kataria et al.
(2016), respectively, which utilize the Substellar and Planetary Radiation and Circulation (SPARC) model (Showman
et al. 2009). The SPARC model couples the general circulation model maintained at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (the MITgcm, Adcroft et al. (2004)) with a planeparallel, two-stream version of the multi-stream radiation
code developed by Marley & McKay (1999). Further details on these models are provided in Showman et al. (2009)),
Kataria et al. (2016) and references therein.
Using the prescription described in Fortney et al. (2006))
and Showman et al. (2009), we compute simulated eclipse
depths derived from our GCM results for each planet over a
period of 1-2 Earth years (Figure 6). At each Spitzer band-

pass, the simulations, on average, exhibit a periodic variation
in eclipse depth of 1-1.5 % over a period of ∼43 days for HD
189733b and a variation of 0.5-1 % over a period of ∼40 days
for HD 209458b. This predicted variability is the result of a
global sloshing mode or wave dynamics deep in the planetary atmosphere that leave only a small measurable effect at
observable pressures Showman et al. (2009). Therefore, hot
Jupiters such as these should exhibit low (∼1%) variability
over timescales much longer than the planet’s orbital period
and smaller than the typical uncertainty in eclipse depth with
current instruments.
The low observed atmospheric variability of HD 189733b
and HD 209458b with Spitzer is in contrast to observations
of brown dwarfs and solar system gas giants where temporal variability at infrared wavelengths has been observed at
the 10-50% level (see review by Artigau 2018). The low
level of observable infrared variability for hot Jupiters like
HD 189733b and HD 209458b compared with brown dwarfs
and solar system gas giants likely arises from differences
in the relative strengths in radiative and advective processes
taking place in their atmospheres. Because brown dwarfs
are self-luminous and comparatively fast rotators (Torb ∼hrs),
their circulation is dominated by multiple bands of jets and
vortices (Showman et al. 2019). In contrast, the high stellar
insolation and synchronous (and hence slower) rotation of hot
Jupiters results in the emergence of strong day-night forcing
that produce fast (∼1 km/s) planetary-scale jets. The strong
radiative forcing and global-scale circulation patterns in the

variability would manifest as peaks in this plot. The data appears to be randomly scattered suggesting that any variability in the eclipse depths is likely
due to precision limitations rather than any periodic variability in the astrophysical signal.

observable portion of hot Jupiter atmospheres suppress small
scale variations in the planet’s thermochemical structure that
would contribute to large-amplitude variations in the dayside
flux from the planet.
5.2. Further Observational Probes of Variability
Our ability to probe variability in exoplanet atmospheres is
currently limited by the available targets and observational facilities. It is important to remember that facilities like Spitzer
were not originally designed for high-precision time-series
observations. With hot Jupiter targets that orbit bright nearby
host stars like HD 209458b and HD 189733b; per eclipse
precisions on the order of 100 ppm can be achieved with
Spitzer. Future observational facilities, such as JWST , will
both improve the achievable precision on eclipse depth measurements and greatly expand the wavelengths over which
they can be obtained (Beichman et al. 2014). Hot Jupiter
models predict significant variations in temperature, chemistry, and circulation patterns as a function of pressure level in
the atmosphere (e.g. Showman et al. 2009), which translates
into a strong wavelength dependence in the predicted levels
of observable variability (e.g. Lewis et al. 2014). The obser-

The top panel is taken from Showman et al. (2009) and shows the predicted
change in eclipse depth orbit to orbit for HD 189733b at 3.6, 4.5, and 8.0 µm.
The bottom panel shows the predicted variation for HD 209458b at 3.6 and
4.5 µm. In both cases the eclipse depths are scaled by the mean eclipse depth
to illustrate only the relative change.
F IG . 5.— Top : HD 189733’s stellar variability from the 2009–2014 observing seasons with our Spitzer /IRAC observations also indicated (IRAC1
in solid blue and IRAC2 in dotted red). Bottom : Conservatively using
HD 189733’s overall peak-to-trough variability (Top), we estimate its impact
on the planet’s eclipse depth using the prescriptions described in Knutson
et al. (2012) and Zellem et al. (2017). We find that any variability-induced
changes to HD 189733b’s eclipse depths (empty blue diamonds for IRAC2
and empty red squares for IRAC2) fall within our measurement uncertainties. Therefore, HD 189733’s stellar variability does not statistically impact
our measured eclipse depths.

vations presented here at 3.6 and 4.5 µm for HD 209458b
and HD 189733b are predicted to probe a fairly limited pressure range in the ∼1-100 mbar level of these planets atmospheres (e.g. Showman et al. 2009). Future observations of
hot Jupiters at higher precision spanning a larger range of
wavelengths as well as observations of cooler exoplanets will
be critical for expanding our understanding of the physical
processes driving variability, or the lack thereof, in exoplanet
atmospheres.
5.3. Non-Uniform Disc
There is prior evidence of non-uniform thermal distributions in both of the targets studied here. The analysis of the
full orbit phase curves of HD 189733b (Knutson et al. 2012)
provide evidence for an eastward shift of the hottest portion of
the planetary atmosphere with respect to the substellar point
of 5.29 ± 0.59 and 2.98 ± 0.82 hours in channels 1 and 2
respectively. These offsets correspond to longitudinal offsets
of 35◦ ± 4◦ and 20◦ ± 6◦ . Similarly, phase curve analysis of
HD 209458b at 4.5 µm by Zellem et al. (2014) indicates an

offset of 41◦ ± 6◦ .
Williams et al. (2006) and Rauscher et al. (2007) predicted that a non-uniform dayside temperature distribution
will change the shape of ingress/egress in comparison to a
uniformly bright model. Also, as Williams et al. (2006) predicted and Agol et al. (2010a) observed, fitting the eclipse of
a planet with a non-uniform dayside temperature distribution
with a uniform occultation model will result in an apparent

8

Kilpatrick et al.

delay in the eclipse time as a result of these changes to the
shape of ingress/egress when the timing of the eclipse is a
free parameter. In Figures 2 and 3 we plot the difference between the center of eclipse time and what would be expected
by assuming that the eclipse would occur at exactly one half
of a period from the transit. HD 209458b consistently shows
an offset in the eclipse time of 155 ± 25 seconds in Channel
1 and 129 ± 16 seconds in Channel 2. HD 189733b shows an
offset of 28 ± 27 seconds in Channel 1 and 35 ± 13 seconds
in Channel 2.
Figure 7 shows the magnitude of the effect of longitudinal offset on the observed center of eclipse time. We create
a model planet with a hotspot of radius (0.5 Rplanet ) utilizing the python package SPIDERMAN (Louden & Kreidberg
2017). The global (out of hot spot) temperature is set to 1200
K and the hot spot temperature to 1700 K. Starting with the
hot spot centered at the substellar point, we move the hotspot
longitudinally in 1◦ increments and fit at each iteration with a
uniform brightness model with center of eclipse time as a free
parameter. We plot in Figure 7 the delay in eclipse time relative to the predicted time exactly one half period from transit.
Note that some portion of apparent delay is present even in the
0◦ offset case. This is due to light travel time across the solar
system (∼ 45 sec. for HD 209). The offset of the maximum
brightness observed in the phase curves would suggest that
eclipse observations fit with a uniform model should exhibit
an offset in eclipse timing of 40 and 60 seconds (Ch. 1 and
2) for HD 189733b and 90 seconds for HD 209458b channel 2 observations. The secondary eclipse fits presented here
show strong agreement with the phase curve observations of
HD 209458b. We are unable to confirm the phase curve offsets for HD 189733b with the precision attained with this set
of observations.
As a further probe of non-uniformity, we refit the data while
fixing the eclipse time to the expected value based on previous observations of epoch of transit and assuming a circular
orbit. We combine the residuals of all the fits of each target in each channel to probe for any coherent deviations from
the uniform model. Fig. 8 shows the stacked residuals from
all of the channel 2 fits of HD 209. Here we see strong evidence for deviations in the shape of ingress/egress that could
be caused by an eastward shifted hotspot. There are other
factors that could also mimic this effect. The effect of eccentricity and shape of planet are explored in detail by de Wit
et al. (2012). However, the precision with which the orbital
properties of both of these canonical hot-Jupiters have been
characterized allow many of factors to be ruled out or tight
enough constraints to be placed on them to make a significant
detection of non-uniformity likely in future eclipse mapping
studies (Rauscher et al. 2018).

6. CONCLUSION

This analysis of multi - epoch secondary eclipse observations of the canonical hot Jupiters, HD 189733b and HD
209458b, finds no evidence for temporal variability greater
than the precision of our observations. We expect variability

in secondary eclipse depth to be driven by the dynamics of
the atmosphere thus motivating comparison of observations
to GCM predictions. The simulations, on average, exhibit a
periodic variation in eclipse depth of 1-1.5 % for both planets
at both 3.6 and 4.5 µm. Based on the uncertainty in each measurement of secondary eclipse depth, we are able to constrain
variability to less than (5.6% and 6.0%) and (12% and 1.6%)
for channels (1,2) of HD 189733b and HD 209458b respec-

F IG . 8.— Here we stack the residuals from the best fit of each HD 209458b
channel 2 observation with the time of mid eclipse fixed to coincide with
phase 0.5 plus the transit time of light across the system. We bin them into 9
separate bins: one each for pre-eclipse, during eclipse, and post-eclipse and
three each for ingress and egress. The structure shown in ingress/egress is
similar to model predictions illustrated in Williams et al. (2006); Rauscher
et al. (2007) resulting from fitting a non-uniform dayside temperature distribution with a uniform occultation model.

tively. The lack of evidence of variability provides motivation and justification to combine multi - epoch observations to
achieve the precision necessary to perform high spatial resolution techniques such as eclipse mapping. The apparent offset
of the center of eclipse time evident in these observations provides further evidence for a non-uniform dayside temperature
distribution for the planet HD 209458b. We compare the evidence for non - uniformity to previous analyses of full phase
curve observations and find agreement with HD 209458b observations at 4.5 µm. The precision achieved by these observations when phase folding and stacking all like observations
is enough to resolve deviations to ingress/egress caused by
a non - uniform temperature distribution in at least the case
of HD 209458b at 4.5 µm. This level of precision meets the
requirements to utilize the eclipse mapping technique to produce spatially resolved, two dimensional maps of the planetary dayside thermal distribution.
