Abstract: During the last 25 years the scientific community has coexisted with the most fascinating
protocol due to Quantum Physics: quantum teleportation (QTele), which would have been
impossible if quantum entanglement, so questioned by Einstein, did not exist. In this work, a
complete architecture for the teleportation of Computational Basis States (CBS) is presented. Such
CBS will represent each of the possible 24 classical bits commonly used to encode every pixel of a
3-color-channel-image (red-green-blue, or cyan-yellow-magenta). For this purpose, a couple of
interfaces: classical-to-quantum (Cl2Qu) and quantum-to-classical (Qu2Cl) are presented with two
versions of the teleportation protocol: standard and simplified.
Keywords: Interfaces; Quantum Communications; Quantum Entanglement; Quantum Image
Processing; Quantum Teleportation; Superdense Coding.

1. Introduction
1.1 Quantum Teleportation
In 1993 a fundamental paper for the history of Physics was published [1], where a protocol for
the teleportation of an unknown quantum state was proposed without violating the No-Cloning
Theorem [2]. This protocol uses a strange phenomenon of Quantum Mechanics (QMech) known as
Quantum Entanglement (QEnta), in which two or more particles leave their individualities to
become part of something unique and integral. These particles retain the aforementioned attribute
even if they are separated to opposite places in the universe.
Now, if we measure one of those particles, the entanglement disappears, the joint wave
function collapses, and if the measured particle becomes a spin-up, the other instantaneously
becomes a spin-down, and vice-versa. This instantaneity is given independently of the distance that
mediates between both particles, contradicting the very essence of Special Relativity (SRela) [3],
which postulates that nothing can travel faster than light. This curious result was called by Einstein
as "spooky action at a distance", and constitutes the center of one of the most famous paradoxes in
the history of Physics suggested by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen known as
EPR paradox [4]. There is a palliative to this controversy which consists in the impossibility of
transmitting useful information through an instantaneous link based on entanglement [1]. This
palliative constitutes a hot border between two of the main pillars of Physics: the SRela [3] and
QMech [5].
In 1964 John Bell [6] tried to solve this controversy by proposing a theorem based on an
inequality by which the non-locality of QMech could be established as long as it violated such
inequality. Experiments carried out by Aspec [7-9] and others (with and without loop-holes)
apparently established the non-locality of QMech, contradicting what was manifested by the EPR
paradox. Part of the scientific community does not question the non-locality of QMech, since there is
an absolute consensus, however, they are hesitant about the quality of the mentioned experiments.

Since 1997, a series of experiments have demonstrated the practical feasibility of QTele protocol
(QTele) [10-18], even in the presence of noise [19-22]. Thirteen years later, Prof. Hotta [23]
demonstrated how energy could be teleported, triggering all kinds of speculations about the
possible teleportation of matter, by virtue of the close link between matter and energy starting from
the famous Einstein equation, E = m c2, for a particle at rest. Currently, a simplified version of the
original QTele protocol [24, 25] opens up a whole new range of possibilities in Quantum
Communications (QComm) [26-29] thus completing the arsenal of essential tools for Quantum
Technology to be used in the future.
1.2 Superdense Coding
A complementary protocol to the QTele, called Superdense Coding (SDC) [1], allows us to send
classical bits through a quantum channel. Besides, SDC is the foundational basis of a couple of
interfaces needed when handling CBS in a QComm context [27]. Recently, a new SDC protocol based
on a simplified version of QTele has come out with remarkable results [25]. In fact, the mentioned
protocol is presented as the most probable basis for secure communication between Earth and Mars,
in a future mission to Mars.
1.3 Interfaces
The need for Cl2Qu and Qu2Cl interfaces in all branches of Quantum Information Processing
(QIP) is evident [30], however, in no other case as in Quantum Image Processing (QImP) has it
become so evident. Works like Quantum Boolean Image Denoising [31] highlight the imperative
need for an efficient interface between each of the possible 24 classical bits commonly used to encode
each pixel of an image with 3 color channels (red, green, blue) and the internal representation that
said classical bits must have within the quantum computer, that is, as CBS. This conversion cannot
result from a qubits preparation procedure because the images are too large, this must be done
automatically thanks to an interface. For example, for an image of 1920 columns, 1080 rows, 8
bits-by-color, and 3 colors (an image of common size these days), we must prepare 49,766,400 qubits
(in this particular case: CBS). This is highly impractical, since, how long would a similar amount of
qubit preparations take us in a laboratory? The problem of Quantum Measurement (QuMe) [32] has
confined the practicality of QImP to the exclusive use of CBS, as it is exposed in [33]. If we wanted to
work in QImP with generic qubits, we would find ourselves with a problem that does not exist to
date even with Cl2Qu interface for this type of qubit. Besides, it is impossible to recover exactly the
Quantum Algorithm (QAlgo) result because of QuMe [32], as explained in [33]. It happens that the
measurement noise due to QuMe is greater than that admissible in a standard process of Digital
Image Processing (DIP) [34-37]. The distortion in the recovery of a qubit at the output of a QAlgo is
greater than that normally accepted [33], being the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP) and the
complementarity [30], the exclusive responsible for it, as explained in [33]. This is the problem that
fundamentally affects the internal representation technique known as Flexible Representation of
Quantum Images (FRQI) [38] and all its variants. Besides, another famous technique within QImP is
that known as Novel Enhanced Quantum Representation (NEQR) [39]. The problem with NEQR, as
well as all its variants, is that it is not a Cl2Qu Interface, however, they need one. In fact, if we had a
Cl2Qu interface, then why would we need NEQR? On the other hand, the reason why both
techniques (FRQI and NEQR) are accepted within QImP resides in the fact that all the papers that
mention them only involve implementations in a high-level interpreter such as MATLAB® [40], and
not on an optical table as it should be. Under these circumstances everything seems to work, but
when done on an optical table the real outcome is very different.

A generic quantum bit (or qubit) can be expressed thanks to the superposition principle [30] as,

2.2 Color decomposition and bit slicing
First, we need to decompose all digital images in their 3 color components (red, green, blue)
[31]. Thus, we will obtain 24 bitplanes (8 bitplanes for every color) thanks to a procedure known as
bit slicing [31]. We get 8 bitplanes per color, where the 7th bitplane (the closest to the observer) is
called the Most Significant Bit (MSB) being the most morphologically committed bitplane with the
original image [31] (Figure 2). Conversely, bitplane 0 (the furthest from the observer) is the Least
Significant Bit (LSB) and the least morphologically committed bitplane with the original image.
Below, we provide the MATLAB® code [40] necessary for slicing:
function Ibpp = slicer(I,bpp)

function bvpp = d2b(p,bpp)

% Casting of the algorithm:

% Casting of algorithm:

% bpp = bit-per-pixel

[ROW,COL] = size(I);

bvpp = zeros(1,bpp);

for r = 1:ROW

for b = 1:bpp

p = p/2;

Ibpp(r,c,b) = aux(b);
end
end

p = floor(p);
d = d+1;
end

end

bvpp = rot90(rot90(bvpp));

It is evident, from here on, that an element in black in every bitplane is a classical bit equal to 1
and will be represented with a qubit equal to

1 , while, an element in white in every bitplane is a

classical bit equal to 0 and will be represented with a qubit equal to

0 in a future Cl2Qu interface.

Figure 3. Angelina and her 8 bitplanes, including MSB and LSB.

Figure 3 shows the 8 bitplanes of Angelina for the red channel in detail, from MSB (bitplane 7)
to LSB (bitplane 0). Let us observe that as we move from MSB to LSB, different bitplanes are
increasingly unrecognizable compared to the original image, i.e., Angelina. As we can see, LSB is
completely different from the original morphology of Angelina’s picture. This is one reason why the
LSB is Steganography territory [41]. The other reason is that any change in the LSB does not produce
visually detectable changes in the original image.

. This distribution constitutes the entanglement link between Alice

and Bob. After that, we continue with the complete sketch of QTele of Figure 4, where the green line
indicates the border between Alice’s and Bob’s sides, that is, both extremes of the entanglement link.
In Figure 4, a single fine line represents a wire carrying one qubit, while a double line represents a
wire carrying one classical bit [30], while, the classical channel is really a control classical channel for
disambiguation purposes (as we will see below through two bits), while the entanglement link is
really an entanglement data link. On the other hand, in Figure 4, the following blocks mean: SPD
(single photon detectors), {x , z} are Pauli’s matrices activated by the bits {b2, b1} respectively [1, 30],
and EPR is the source of

The last rows of Equation (11) represent Alice’s options inside the SPD. Alice randomly selects
one of the bases and performs the measurement, transmitting to Bob the corresponding classical bits
through a classical channel. Alice's options within the SPD are equally probable and the random
choice that she makes of the base has to do with being sure not to clone the original state between her
and Bob [10, 11].
Table 1 synthesizes the complete process of QTele, where Alice measures two of the possible
qubits of the basis of Equation (8), and therefore, she transmits the corresponding bits b1 and b2 via a
classical channel to Bob. The QMeas process is imperative to make the wave-function of the original
arbitrary state collapse since this is necessary to do so as not to violate the No-Cloning Theorem [2].
In other words, the QMeas process destroys the original arbitrary state [30, 32] eliminating any
possibility of cloning.

The last column of Table 1 represents the local operations realized by Bob in t3 and t4 to
reconstruct the original state

 . At this point, it is important to mention that in literature there are

several concerns regarding the implementation of teleportation protocols using a bigger or smaller
dimensional commitment but always with two classical bits for disambiguation. An interesting
example can be found in [42], which shows that the one-qubit teleportation can be considered as a
state transfer between subspaces of the whole Hilbert’s space of an indivisible eight-dimensional
system. However, this as well as the rest of the papers that manipulate high dimensional quantum
systems for the implementation of QTele protocols do it with two classical bits for disambiguation,
except in the case of the new protocol presented here which does not use disambiguation bits.
On Alice's side, the combination of the modules composed by the following gates: CNOT, H
(Hadamard) and QMeas, constitute what is known as the Bell-State-Measurement (BSM), while on
Bob's side, its modules are unitary operations necessary for the reconstruction of the teleported state.
Alice’s measurement and transmission of the classical bits of disambiguation along with Bob's
unitary operations are the clearest examples of Local Operations and Classical Communications
(LOCC) [43].

From here on, we will follow a procedure similar to that of Table 1 but taking into account how
sensitively the state is affected by noise. In fact, seeing Equation (16), it is evident that it is almost
impossible to recover the state  in an exact way [19-22, 24, 25].

2.5 Simplified Quantum Teleportation - noiseless analysis
Unlike the standard version, the new protocol frees us from the use of a classical channel to
transmit the disambiguation bits, and the use of Pauli’s matrices in Bob's side used to reconstruct the
teleported state from the mentioned disambiguation bits. These simplifications are the underlying
reasons for the title of this paper, that is, simplified protocol.
In the new protocol (Figure 5), block “ 0 reset” does a strict reset of the qubit, while, we need
to produce 00  

instead of   00

used in the standard version. We must highlight as a

fundamental contrast between both versions of QTele (the standard and the simplified) that the
Kronecker product “  ” is not commutative [30].

It is clear from Equation (18) that no disambiguation is necessary. Alice blocks her two branch
thanks to a qubit reset gate [|0>] pair in order to annul all the projections with |1> components in
Eq.(18) and (19). The No-Cloning Theorem [2] is never violated. We can also see in Figure 5 that it is
not necessary for Bob to apply any unitary transformation. This eliminates the classical channel that
is responsible for making teleportation as a whole to be carried out in a time greater than zero, i.e.,
not being instantaneous.
Although this result seems to contradict the relativistic principle of causality [4], the reality is
that this never happens. As we can see in [25], the instantaneity of entanglement is possible without
the need to resort to superluminal signaling and without any contradictions between QMech and
SRela. This last fact then covers the new protocol in a direct and complete way.

The worst consequence of noise in the new protocol is that the teleported state loses its purity,
which means, it would not be on Bloch's sphere, in the more general case, given that C  1 , even so,
the teleported state is recovered without problems or disambiguation. This clearly indicates that the
new protocol is much more robust (immune to noise) than the standard, for generic qubits as well as
for CBS.

2.7 Interfaces
From SDC emerges an extraordinary set of interfaces for an efficient relationship between
classical bits and CBS, and vice-versa. Figure 6 shows the SDC protocol, which is composed of two
well-defined blocks: one which is light blue and the other one pink. The light blue block works as a
Cl2Qu interface, while the pink block works as a Qu2Cl interface. All this, of course, is exclusively
defined to be used with classical bits, and in consequence, CBS.

Figure 6. SDC protocol and the detail of its constituent interfaces.

Next, we will describe how the SDC protocol works from left to right, which is the correct way
of describing how both interfaces (Cl2Qu and Qu2Cl) work. An important detail to highlight before
starting is that we can work with: 2 classic bits to be transmitted (Figure 6), a single classic bit (b1) to
be transmitted and b2 which makes ancilla equal to zero, or N classic bits to be transmitted as a
natural extension of the protocol of Figure 6. This last case will be particularly useful in the practical
application of the interfaces for the treatment of digital images, in such a way that N = 24 and each
application of the protocol implies working with a complete pixel of a color image. For a better
development of the idea, we will work with 2 classic bits extracting Cl2Qu from Figure 6 to form
Figure 7.

At this point, it is important to clarify that the quantum channel of Figure 6 inside the Cl2Qu
interface is obviously unnecessary (Figure 7). In fact, the definitive Cl2Qu interface is absolutely
compact and henceforth it will be considered as a unified block. Finally, we will apply the
Hadamard’s gate to the last set of equations according to Figures 6 and 7 [24, 25], thus,

Here Cl2Qu interface finalizes. Basically, Cl2Qu interface is a block that performs a transfer of
type b1 , b2    b1 , b2  for CBS, i.e., 0,1   0 , 1  .
The pink block of Figure 6 constitutes the Qu2Cl interface. In fact, at the entrance of that block,
we have  b1 , b2  , while at its exit we have b1 , b2  , i.e., QuMe is a Qu2Cl interface in itself. With
this sequence Cl2Qu + Qu2Cl we complete the standard SDC. In this way, the circle closes, and at
least in theory, we should recover at the exit of the pink block the same classical bits that we have
entered at the entrance of the light blue block. Consequently, we can use a coincidence counter to
evaluate the performance of the complete SDC protocol, and to know what the level of coupling
between both interfaces is.
A relevant detail to take into account is that when we measure a CBS, we completely recover its
classical counterpart, a situation very different from what happens with a generic qubit, which does
not have a classical counterpart and if it existed it would be unattainable to obtain it [30, 31, 33]. In
fact, it is only necessary to make a measurement on the z-axis of the Bloch’s sphere (vertical)
avoiding the typical problems associated with QuMe, HUP and reciprocity [30-33].
2.8 Complete architecture to be used
Figure 8 represents a complete architecture for an enhanced SDC. This figure shows both
interfaces where we can appreciate a pair of green blocks labeled QTele between them. Actually,
these blocks can represent the two types of seen teleportations: standard and simplified. Besides,
these blocks constitute the imaginary boundary between Alice’s and Bob’s sides. It is important to
mention that this configuration can be used to transmit a single classic bit at a time, where, b2 could
be considered an ancilla, then, the architecture of Figure 8 would have a single block of QTele or
horizontal thread.

Figure 8. Enhanced SDC using Cl2Qu and Qu2Cl interfaces and two blocks of QTele.

If we expand the idea of Figure 8 by involving the steps necessary to decompose a color digital
image in their corresponding constituent bits, then, we will arrive to Figure 9. This is essentially the
scheme we will use for the experiments in the next section. Figure 9 shows on top the original image
to be teleported, then the three color channels (red, green and blue) of the image are separated. Later,
each color channel is decomposed in 8 bitplanes. The bit of each bitplane is introduced into a Cl2Qu
interface. The equivalent qubits are teleported. Bob receives each qubit with a Qu2Cl interface. With
the obtained bits, the bitplanes are reconstructed, then the three color channels are reassembled and

finally the teleported image is obtained. The lower part of Figure 9 shows a comparison between the
acquired bit of the original image and the recovered bit from the complete architecture. Finally, the
complete comparison of all individual bits becomes the total comparison between both images: the
original and the teleported one for the purpose of evaluating the level of degradation introduced by
the complete procedure using as a metric the coincidence counter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the following section, the intermediate instances of each step of the procedure will also be monitored
and analyzed.
3. Results
3.1. Setup
All experiments of this section consist of implementations on Quirk® [44] simulator. In the
complete architecture for the QTele of Angelina image (Figure 9), we randomly select 100 of the
1920x1080x3x8 bits of the original image, although fewer bits of alternate values (i.e., 0 and 1) and
from different locations would be enough.
We will evaluate the performance in the reconstruction of such bits thanks to a coincidence
counter, which can be seen in the lower part of Figure 9.
Finally, we will clarify the number of qubits used in each simulation carried out with the
Quirk® simulator, as well as the corresponding circuit lay-out, in order to facilitate the reproduction
of all the experiments done here.
3.2. Partial tests
These experiments involve evaluating separately each of the protocols to be used in the final
configuration for the QTele of the image, before proceeding with it. Such experiments aim to
unmask in an individual way the possible responsible for the collectively incorrect results.
3.2.1. Superdense coding
Based on the protocol of Figure 6, we will implement the complete SDC, which is equivalent to
the union between Cl2Qu and Qu2Cl interfaces. Figure 10 represents the complete configuration for
Quirk® simulator with the explicit results inside the figure through a series of activation (on) and
deactivation (off) flags, from {b1,b2}={0,0} to {b1,b2}={1,1}.

Figure 10(d). SDC  Cl2Qu  Qu2Cl on Quirk® for {b1,b2}={1,1}.

For this experiment, we used 4 qubits on the Quirk® simulator. The total coincidences of the
flags (in on or off, at the entrance and exit of the protocol) in the four cases (i.e., 00, 01, 10 and 11)
represent the success in the SDC process. The connection labelled as send represents the optical
channel in yellow in Figure 6, although, as it is obvious, within the Cl2Qu interface such a
connection does not exist. Finally, 3 points in a row represent the border between both blocks.
The experimental implementation for the transmission of 100 classical bits taken into pairs and
their posterior recovering gave us as a result on Quirk® simulator a complete set of coincidences. It
is evident that fewer pairs would have given the same results.
3.2.2. Standard QTele
Figure 11 shows the complete process of Standard QTele, which is only implemented thanks to
3 qubits on Quirk® simulator.
Figure 11(a) remits us to the case of a generic qubit, which has an arbitrary allocation on the
Bloch’s sphere [30]. Figures 11(b) and 11(c) show a pair of particular cases where the qubits are both
CBS, i.e., 0 and 1 , respectively.
As in the case of Figures 4 and 5, a single fine line represents a wire carrying one qubit, while a
double line represents a wire carrying one classical bit [30].
The possibility of a fast, precise and graphically expressive simulation on a complete toolbox
environment, independently of the pertinent code makes Quirk® simulator an attractive choice.

3.3. Standard QTele of a digital image
As we have said, this is the first implementation for the QTele of an image. Figure 13 represents
such implementation on Quirk® simulator.
The architecture of Figure 13 shows the perfect complementation between the Standard QTele
and both interfaces, i.e., Cl2Qu and Qu2Cl. This configuration required 8 qubits.
We must bear in mind that at a certain point the QTele must be separated a considerable
distance between Alice's side and Bob's side. In Figure 13 that separation has not been incorporated
so as not to complicate the graphic.
The 50 pairs of classic bits of type {00,01,10,11} were randomly taken from all those that makeup
Angelina image, in fact, 1920x1080x3x8, according to the procedure of Figure 9. The percentage of
coincidences reached 100 %.

3.4. Simplified QTele of a digital image
Figure 14 shows us the economy in the gates utilization of the Simplified version respect to the
implementation based on the Standard version of QTele, however, we have obtained similar results
in both cases with 8 qubits too.
For this case, we also used 50 pairs of bits randomly selected from the complete set of bits
corresponding to the original image of Angelina. Figure 14 represents the four cases of possible pairs
that we found during the random exploration of the image. These pairs are the same that we used in
the previous case and for SDC, i.e., {00,01,10,11}.
This implementation, like the previous ones, demonstrates the effectiveness and ductility of the
Cl2Qu and Qu2Cl interfaces, which can be successfully reused in other areas of QIP [30], such as
QComp [45], QComm [26-29], and Quantum Internet [46-49], including undoubtedly, Quantum
Cryptography [50], in general, and Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) [51-54], in particular.

4. Discussion
The results of Section 3 show the absolute viability of the procedure consisting of the QTele of
an image, as well as, the complete success of the new interfaces: Cl2Qu and Qu2Cl. Besides, the
simplified version of QTele has demonstrated to have similar results to the standard version, which
is plausible considering the fact that it has fewer quantum gates than the standard version. The two
QTele versions were successful in both the partial and the collective experiments.
The fact that both integrating experiments begin and end with the binary bits belonging to the
pixels of the image to be teleported and the teleported image, respectively, allowed us the use of a
coincidence counter as a metric. This constituted an excellent strategy for evaluating the functional
quality of the integrating architecture, with the same strictness than those individually used in both
QTele protocols and both interfaces.
Another important strategy consisted of the use of Quirk® simulator in each experiment. It let
us know the final outcome following a binary criterion: it works-or-it does not work. This is of great
value since knowing the final outcome, whether or not a specific configuration or architecture
works, is key before mobilizing a huge amount of human resources as well as purchasing and/or
replacing expensive laboratory equipment for an eventual optical table.
The findings have deep implications in the context of all type of digital signal transmission,
where, such signals can represent streaming, multi and hyper-spectral images, video or future TV
broadcasting. Besides, the new interfaces have an excellent projection on QIP [30] in general and
Quantum Computing [45] in particular, in configurations like Cl2Qu-Quantum-Algorithm-Qu2Cl.
Future implementations will be directed to applications outside the laboratory, i.e., practical
uses like Quantum Internet [46-49]. Besides, the projection of the simplified QTele on Quantum Key
Distribution (QKD) [51-54] is very interesting, since this new protocol does not use classical bits for

J. Imaging 2019, 5, x FOR PEER REVIEW

23 of 25

disambiguation via a classical channel, while increasing considerably the level of security of QKD
eliminating well an unnecessary exposition on one of the channels commonly used in it.
On the other hand, we must bear in mind that for both integrating architectures we must
distribute 1920x1080x3x8/2 EPR pairs, in other words, a logistical nightmare. Besides, we must
consider the following:
 the short half-life of the entanglement due to decoherence [55],
 the short half-life of the qubits [56],
 the type of used qubit (trapped ion, superconductor, topological, etc.) [57], and
 the way of distributing the EPR pairs: delivery vs take-out [25].
Finally, Figures 10 to 14 were edited specifically to incorporate the lower labels that demarcate
