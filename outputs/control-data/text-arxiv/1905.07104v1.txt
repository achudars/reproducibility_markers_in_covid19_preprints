Abstract
The non-interacting field belonging to a new SO(1,3) gauge field
theory equivalent to General Relativity is canonically quantized in the
Lorentz gauge and the physical Fock space F Phys for free gauge particles is constructed. To assure both relativistic covariance and positivity
of the norm and energy expectation value for physical states restrictions needed in the construction of the physical Fock space are put
consequentially on state vectors, and not on the algebra of creation
and annihilation operators as usual – alltogether providing the second
step in consistently quantizing gravitation

Introduction

Gravity has defied so far all attempts at consistent quantization. In fact,
Einstein’s theory of General Relativity (GR) and its generalizations turn out
to be either not renormalizable or do not respect unitarity at the quantum
level.
GR itself is not renormalizable in essence due to the fundamental field
g, the metric, or equivalently e, the Vierbein, being of mass-dimension zero.
Simple power-counting allows to demonstrate that the loop expansion of
the quantum effective action contains divergent contributions of ever higher
mass-dimension – destroying renormalizability [1].
All attempts to deal with this fundamental difficulty have failed essentially because all generalizations of GR analyzed in the literature offering a
seeming way out still contain g, or equivalently e, as at least one dynamical
field due to the local translation or coordinate invariance to which these
theories are subject to. As a result in all cases one ends up with either a
non-renormalizable or a non-unitary theory.
In [2] we have started a programme aiming to overcome those difficulties
step-by-step.
Our first step as been to take a point of departure different from the
literature at the classical level already: a theory for classical gravity which
is not equal, but only equivalent to GR, and which in return allows for
renormalizable actions for the fundamental field. In fact in [2] we have
developed a new classical gauge field theory of the Lorentz group SO(1,3)
which a) contains as the only dynamical field the dimension-one Lorentz
gauge field in terms of which all else can be expressed and which allows for
actions renormalizable by power-counting, and b) is equivalent to GR in a
limiting case. Whilst a renormalizability proof seems within reach for this
theory [3], another difficulty has to be resolved first, which arises from the
non-compactness of SO(1,3): establishing that the canonical quantization
of the gauge fields allows for the definition of positive-norm, positive-energy
states and a corresponding relativistically-invariant physical Fock space for
these fields - and that negative-norm states completely decouple.
The second step of our programme and the goal of this paper is exactly
to provide that resolution. We do this by strictly adhering to our guiding principles of keeping to relativistic and SO(1,3) gauge covariance, to
treating the SO(1,3) gauge symmetry strictly as an inner symmetry, and to
renormalizability which were at the origin of developing the SO(1,3) gauge
field theory in the first place [2]. In addition in this paper we intertwine
2

relativistic covariance with positivity of the norm and energy expectation
value for physical states, and consequentially put restrictions needed in the
search of a physical Fock space on state vectors, and not on the algebra of
creation and annihilation operators as usual.
The next step of our programme will have to be the renormalizability
proof of the full quantum theory [3] and the final one to establish the unitarity of the S-matrix on the physical Fock space constructed in this paper.
To establish that canonical quantization of the free gauge fields allows for
the definition of positive-norm, positive-energy states and a corresponding
relativistically invariant physical Fock space we have organized this paper as
follows. In section two we revisit the fundamentals of the new Lorentz gauge
field theory of gravitation which is renormalizable by power-counting and
equivalent to General Relativity. In section three we derive the Lagrangian
of the free Lorentz gauge field theory in the Lorentz gauge which serves as
starting point for the covariant canonical quantization of the non-interacting
theory in terms of the gauge fields and their conjugate canonical momenta
in section four. In section five we recast the theory in terms of the creation and annihilation operators corresponding to the gauge field operators.
In sections six and seven we establish the one-particle subspace of states
F1LG fulfilling the Lorentz gauge condition and the one-particle subspace
of states F1P orthogonal to their dual state with positive semidefinite norm
respectively which in combination allow for the definition of the one-particle
subspace of states F1LG & P with positive semidefinite norm and energy expectation value in section eight. The final three sections are devoted to
Phys
establish the physical one-particle space of states F1
with positive norm
and energy expectation value, to prove the covariance of the quantization apPhys
Phys
proach on F1
and to define the physical n-particle space of states Fn

and the physical Fock space F
for free gauge particles respectively.

Lorentz gauge field theory of gravitation equivalent to General Relativity

In this section we revisit local Lorentz invariance and the corresponding
classical gauge field theory equivalent to General Relativity as developed
in [2] to prepare for the derivation and quantization of the free Lorentz
quantum gauge field theory.
Let us start with some notations around the Lorentz gauge group SO(1,3)
and algebra so(1,3) at the core of the theory. We will mainly work with
3

infinitesimal group elements 1 + Θω (x), where
Θω (x) =

i γδ
ω (x)(Lγδ + Σγδ ) ∈ so(1, 3)
2

(1)

is a local element of the gauge algebra so(1,3), x a point in Minkowski spacetime M4 ≡ (R4 ,η) given in Cartesian coordinates and η = diag(−1, 1, 1, 1) is
the flat spacetime metric with which indices are raised and lowered throughout this paper. Indices α, β, γ, ... denote quantities defined on M4 which
transform covariantly.
Above ω γδ = −ω δγ are the six infinitesimal gauge parameters parametrizing the Lorentz algebra. Treating Lorentz transformations as ”inner” transformations [2] the spacetime-related algebra generators acting on field space
are given by
Lγδ = −Lδγ = −i(xγ ∂δ − xδ ∂γ )
(2)
whilst Σγδ denote the generators of an arbitrary finite-dimensional spin representation of the Lorentz algebra.
Generators of any representation obey the commutation relations
[Jαβ , Jγδ ] = i{ηαγ Jβδ − ηβγ Jαδ + ηβδ Jαγ − ηαδ Jβγ }

(3)

which in effect defines the Lorentz algebra so(1,3).
The action of a local infinitesimal group element 1+Θω (x) on a field ϕ(x)
living in an arbitrary finite-dimensional spin representation of the Lorentz
group is given by
xα −→ x′α = xα

(4)

′

ϕ(x) −→ ϕ (x) = ϕ(x) + δω ϕ(x),
where
δω ϕ(x) = (Θω (x)ϕ)(x)
i
= −ω γδ (x)xδ ∂γ ϕ(x) + ω γδ (x)Σγδ ϕ(x).
2

(5)

In order to define locally gauge-covariant expressions we need to introduce a covariant derivative ∇α (x) as usual which obeys
(∇α (x)ϕ)′ = ∇′α (x)ϕ′

and a related gauge field Bα (x)

living in the Lorentz algebra so(1,3). Above primed quantities refer to
gauge-transformed quantities. For further details we refer to [2].
To deal with the ever more involved algebraic expressions in the further
development of the theory we rewrite the covariant derivative ∇α (x)

field Bα γδ (x) in our theory, and the short-hand notations

We have elaborated in depth why eα ϑ [B] not being a fundamental field
is so crucial for the further development of the theory which turns out to be
both equivalent to General Relativity and renormalizable [2].
As usual we next define the field strength G operator acting on field

The geometrical significance of all: the gauge field B, field strength G and T
as well as R has been further illuminated in terms of a Banach fibre bundle
structure with trivial base manifold M4 and infinite-dimensional fibres for
the various fields in [2].
There we also have given the transformation behaviour of the various
quantities under local Lorentz gauge transformations.

more involved demonstration that counterterms needed to absorb infinite
contributions to the perturbative expansion of the effective action of the full

Taking the limit g → 0 above the surviving dimension-zero and -one terms
can be neglected because the former is an infinite field-independent constant

Covariant Canonical Quantization of the noninteracting theory

In this section, in a fully relativistically covariant way, we canonically
quantize the gauge fields B in the Lorentz gauge whose dynamics is governed
by the non-interacting Lagrangian given by Eqn.(29), and determine the
expressions for the energy and momentum field operators in terms of B.
A usual we start with the gauge fields Bα γδ (t, x) for a fixed time t and
first determine their canonically conjugate momenta

In the remainder of the paper – generalizing the covariant Gupta-Bleuler
treatment of the photon field [4] – we will work our way step-by-step to a
relativistically invariant physical Fock space based on Eqns.(35) and (36)
which will display positive norm and energy for all its states, and in which
only 6 from the original 24 degrees of freedom will survive.

Creation and annihilation operators of the noninteracting theory

In this section we introduce the covariant creation and annihilation operators b† and b respectively and calculate all: their commutation relations
and the expressions for the energy and the momentum operators in terms
of them. We then naively construct the corresponding one-particle pseudo
Hilbert space of states, not yet taking into account neither the Lorentz gauge
fixing nor the physical requirements of positive probability and positive energy.
As usual we first Fourier-transform the hermitean gauge field B introducing b† and b

completely which will be crucial in the further development of our thoughts.
The energy operator acts on | f i as

One-particle subspace of states F1LG fulfilling the
Lorentz gauge condition

In this section we take the first step towards the identification of a viable
physical Fock space by introducing the one-particle subspace of states F1LG
fulfilling the Lorentz gauge condition which is in essence a condition on the
α-index of the polarization tensor fα γδ (k).
Let us start by introducing the negative-frequency part of the gauge field
B by
Z
Bα(−) γδ (x) =

dk̃ bα γδ (k) eikx .

(60)

We then define a one-particle state | f i

| f i ∈ F1LG

(61)

to be in the one-particle subspace of states F1LG fulfilling the Lorentz gauge
condition if (i) holds
(i) :

∂

(62)

which assures that | f i fulfills the Lorentz condition in the mean
hf | ∂ α Bα γδ (x) | f i = 0.

(63)

To fulfill the condition above we have to have
kα fα γδ (k) = k0 f0 γδ (k) + ki fi γδ (k)
= ωk f0 γδ (k) +

for all kα which implies

∀ kα .

(65)

Above we have implicitly introduced a coordinate system in Minkowski space
singling out a time- or 0-axis and three space- or i-axes to which we will
refer to later again. To be specific let one spatial axis be parallel and the
two others be perpendicular to k.

one-particle state vector – in effect reducing the 24 degrees of freedom we
have started with to 4 × 3 = 12, however only 6 coming with positive-norm,
positive-energy and another 6 still coming with negative-norm, negativeenergy.

One-particle subspace of states F1P orthogonal to
their dual state with positive semidefinite norm

In this section we take the second step towards the identification of a viable
physical Fock space by introducing the one-particle subspace of states F1P
orthogonal to their dual state with positive semidefinite norm which will
turn out to be in essence a condition on the γ, δ-indices of the polarization
tensor fα γδ (k).
We start by defining a one-particle state | f i
| f i ∈ F1P
16

(70)

to be in the one-particle subspace of states F1P orthogonal to their dual state
with positive semidefinite norm if the two conditions (ii − a) and (ii − b)
hold
(ii − a) :

(ii − b) :

!

hf | f i ≥ 0
!
hfˆ| f i = 0.

(71)

Above we have introduced the state | fˆi dual to | f i
| fˆi ≡

r Z

2

dk̃ εγδ ηζ f α γδ (k) b†α ηζ (k) | 0i

(72)

which plays a crucial role in the further development of the theory.
In addition to demanding (ii−a) and (ii−b) to hold for individual states
we must require linearity
| f i, | gi ∈ F1P ⇒ | f i + | gi = | f + gi ∈ F1P

(73)

so as to assure F1P is indeed a linear space and prove consistency of the three
requirements alltogether.
To do so we note that the two requirements (ii − a)′ and (ii − b)′
(ii − a)′ :

so that
′

(ii − b) :

fα∗ γδ (k) fα γδ (k) ≥ 0,

fα∗ γδ (k) f α γδ (k)
fˆα∗ γδ (k) fα γδ (k) =

no summation over α!

≥0

(74)

0

are sufficient for (ii − a) and (ii − b) to hold.
On the other hand (ii − a)′ and (ii − b)′ imply for α fixed the existence of
a Lorentz transformation ΛγP η (f, α, k) and an antisymmetric tensor fαP ηζ (k)
such that fα γδ (k) can be written in terms of the three components fαP ij (k)
only [5]
fα γδ (k) = ΛγP η (f, α, k) ΛδP ζ (f, α, k) fαP
with

fαP 0i (k)

=

−fαP i0 (k)

ηζ

(k)

(75)

= 0.

We note that both the Lorentz transformation and ΛP and f P are not
uniquely defined at this point. To completely fix both ΛP and f P we first
′
perform a Lorentz transformation on fα γδ (k) to an arbitrary fαP ηζ (k) ful′
′
filling fαP 0i (k) = −fαP i0 (k) = 0. We then can still perform SO(3) ro′′
′′
tations which respect fαP 0i (k) = −fαP i0 (k) = 0. Let these rotations be
17

parametrized by their rotation vectors α, where the direction of α defines
the rotation axis and its length the rotation angle. To fix ΛP and f P completely we choose the rotation such that its rotation axis is parallel to k and
the coordinate system of the plane perpendicular to k coincides with the
one defined in the preceding section.
We finally note that at this point ΛγP η (f, α, k) may depend on all: f , α
and k.
Let us turn the consideration above on its head and look at the linear
space of tensors fαP ηζ (k) antisymmetric in η, ζ with fαP 0i (k) = −fαP i0 (k) =
0. It is then possible to demonstrate that having fα γδ (k) of the form
fα γδ (k) = ΛγP η (k) ΛδP ζ (k) fαP

ηζ

(k)

(76)

with Λγ η (k) depending only on k, but neither on f nor α, is necessary and
sufficient for (ii − a)′ , (ii − b)′ and the linearity condition to hold which
implies (ii − a), (ii − b) and Eqn.(73) to hold as well.
As a result a general one-particle state | f i ∈ F1P is written as
r Z

dk̃ ΛγP η (k) ΛδP ζ (k) fαP ηζ (k) ΛιP γ (k) ΛκP δ (k) bP †α ικ (k) | 0i

(44) and (45) as bα γδ (k) = ΛιP γ (k) ΛκP δ (k) bP α ικ (k) and b†β ηζ (k) do due to
the covariance of the commutation relations.
Finally the energy operator acts on a one-particle state | f i ∈ F1P as
√ Z
H | f i = 2 dk̃ ωk f P α ij (k) bPα † ij (k) | 0i = H | f P i.

(78)

The norm of such a state becomes
hf | f i =

dk̃ fαP ∗ ij (k) f P α ij (k) = hf P | f P i ≥ 0

(79)

and its energy expectation value
hf | H | f i =

Z

dk̃ ωk fαP ∗ ij (k) f P α ij (k) = hf P | H | f P i ≥ 0.
18

(80)

As a result both the norm and the energy expectation value of a general
state | f i ∈ F1P depend only on the ij-components of the one-particle state
vector – in effect reducing the 24 degrees of freedom we have started with
to 4 × 3 = 12. Note that both the norm and the energy expectation value
are positive semidefinite due to the Eqns.(71) defining F1P .

One-particle subspace of states F1LG & P with positive semidefinite norm and energy expectation
value

In this section we take the third and crucial step towards the identification
of a viable physical Fock space by introducing the one-particle subspace of
states F1LG & P with positive semidefinite norm and energy expectation value
which combines the conditions on the α-index and the γ, δ-indices of the
polarization tensor fα γδ (k) formulated in the two preceding sections.
We start by defining a one-particle state | f i
| f i ∈ F1LG & P

(81)

to be in the one-particle subspace of states F1LG & P with positive semidefinite norm and energy expectation value if the three conditions (i), (ii − a)
and (ii − b) plus the linearity condition hold

state vector – in effect reducing the 24 degrees of freedom we have started
with to 2 × 3 = 6, however only 3 coming with positive-norm, positive-energy
and another 3 still coming with negative-norm, negative-energy. Note that
the 2 in 2 × 3 = 6 comes from the transversality condition as discussed in
section 6.

From Eqn.(91) it becomes obvious that longitudinal states with f P i jk (k)

energy expectation value zero – so in some sense equivalent to the zero state,

Covariance of the quantization approach on F1Phys

In this section we demonstrate the covariance of our approach to canonically quantizing the Lorentz gauge fields on the physical one-particle space
of states F1Phys with positive norm and energy expectation value.
Before starting with the demonstration of the covariance we note that
our approach allows to consistently represent the creation and annihilation
operator algebra given by Eqns.(44) and (45) on the physical one-particle
Phys
space of states F1
with positive norm and energy expectation value and
– as we will show in the next section – on the physical Fock space of states
F Phys . This is an extension of the Gupta-Bleuler approach to the quantization of free gauge fields for compact gauge groups, where positivity of
the norm and energy expectation value of states is assured by the positive
definiteness of the Cartan metric on the gauge algebra, and is in itself an
interesting result.
Let us turn now to the demonstration of the covariance of our approach
to canonically quantize the Lorentz gauge fields. We will split this demonstration into two steps.
The first step starts with a physicist who works in the primed reference
frame to write down a general physical one-particle state

(108)

Note that the state Eqn.(105) does contain a longitudinal part in general.
Next we look at another physicist who works in the unprimed reference
frame related to the primed frame by a Lorentz transformation Λ. This
Lorentz transformation relates the unprimed to the primed quantities as

(110)

with the unprimed b† , b obeying the same creation and annihilation operator algebra given by Eqns.(44) and (45) as do the primed creation and
annihilation operators. In addition we have
kα fα γδ (k) = 0

(i) :

hf | f i = hf ′P hys | f ′P hys i ≥ 0
hfˆ| f i = hfˆ′P hys | f ′P hys i = 0.

fα 0i (k) = −fα i0 (k) 6= 0

(112)

Conclusions

In this paper we have first derived the non-interacting SO(1,3) gauge field
theory in the Lorentz gauge from the interacting Lorentz gauge field theory
of gravitation which is renormalizable by power-counting and equivalent to
General Relativity. We then have canoncically quantized the non-interacting
theory and step-by-step established the relativistically invariant physical
Fock space F Phys for free gauge particles which contains only states with
positive norm and energy expectation value.
As an encouraging result we have at this point successfully completed two
steps out of our four-step programme aiming to establish a renormalizable
quantum theory of gravity – the first step being to establish a theory for
classical gravity which is not equal, but equivalent to GR, and which in
return allows for renormalizable actions for the dynamical field, the second to
show that a proper canonical quantization of the free gauge fields allows for
the definition of positive-norm, positive-energy states and a corresponding
relativistically invariant physical Fock space for these fields.
Obviously much remains to be done – first and foremost the third step of
our programme which is to prove the renormalizability of the full quantum
theory [3] and the final one which is to establish the unitarity of the Smatrix on the physical Fock space constructed in this paper. Then there is
the question about the β-functions for both the pure gravitational theory
and the gravitational theory coupled to all other fields in the standard model
of particle physics.
In addition a deeper understanding is needed of the relativistically invariant mirror Fock space of negative-norm, negative-energy states which can
be constructed in exactly the same way as its positive-norm, positive-energy
Fock space cousin, especially around the question what protects against
transitions from one to the other if the interactions are activated.
Finally as already mentioned in [2] the explanation of phenomena such
as the accelerated expansion of the universe or the galaxy rotation curves
not compatible with the observed matter distribution might after all not
be linked to dark energy or dark matter, but rather to a refined theory of
gravitation at both the classical and the quantum level – the free-field limit
of which we have established in this paper. Further progress is possible.

Abstract
A new SO(1,3) gauge field theory classically equivalent to General
Relativity is quantized and the gauge-fixed path integral representation
of the quantum effective action (QEA) is derived. Both the gaugefixed classical action and the QEA are shown to be invariant under
nilpotent BRST variations of the gauge, matter, ghost, antighost and
Nakanishi-Lautrup fields defining the theory and a Zinn-Justin equation constraining the QEA is derived. Dimensional analysis and the
various linear constraints put on the QEA plus the ones from the nonlinear Zinn-Justin equation are deployed to demonstrate full renormalizability such that all infinities appearing in a perturbative expansion
of the QEA can be absorbed into the gauge-fixed classical action solely
by field renormalizations and coupling redefinitions – alltogether providing the third step in consistently quantizing gravitation

Introduction

This is the third in a series of papers on the classical and quantum theory
of gravitation [1, 2] in which we step-by-step develop a programme aimed
at consistently quantizing gravity.
So far we have taken two steps.
The first step has been to formulate a theory for classical gravity which
is not equal to GR in its outset, yet equivalent to it in its predictions, and
which allows for renormalizable actions in its fundamental dynamical field
[1]. Technically it is a new gauge field theory of the Lorentz group SO(1,3)
which a) contains as the only dynamical field the dimension-one Lorentz
gauge field in terms of which all else can be expressed, which b) allows
for actions at most quadratic in the first derivatives of the gauge field and
renormalizable by power-counting, and which c) is equivalent to GR in its
predictions in a limiting case. In other words it is a candidate theory of
gravitation viable at the classical level which is not plagued by the wellknown flaws preventing consistent quantization in the usual approaches.
The second step has been to establish that the canonical quantization of
the non-interacting gauge field in the SO(1,3) gauge field theory allows for
the definition of positive-norm, positive-energy states and a corresponding
relativistically-invariant physical Fock space for the quantum theory in spite
of the non-compactness of the gauge group SO(1,3) and the corresponding
indefinite Cartan metric on the gauge algebra [2]. This has been achieved by
intertwining relativistic covariance with positivity of the norm and energy
expectation values for physical states, and consequentially putting restrictions needed in establishing a physical Fock space on state vectors, and not
on the algebra of creation and annihilation operators.
The third and current step of our programme is the renormalizability
proof for the full quantum theory including the demonstration that unphysical ghosts decouple which appear in the gauge-fixed path integral quantization of the classical theory, and establishing the pseudo-unitarity of the
S-matrix on the naı̈ve Fock space containing negative-norm, negative-energy
states besides the physical ones.
The final step of our programme will be to establish the unitarity of the
S-matrix on the physical Fock space constructed in [2].
To effectively establish renormalizability of the full quantum theory in
this paper we start in section two revisiting the gauge field theory of the
Lorentz group SO(1,3) at the classical level to then derive gauge-fixed path
integral expressions for the expectation values of physical observables and
2

the quantum effective action (QEA). In section three we rewrite these expressions in terms of path integrals over additional ghost, antighost and
Nakanishi-Lautrup fields allowing in section four in an elegant way to introduce nilpotent BRST field variations and to demonstrate the invariance of
the gauge-fixed classical action and the QEA under these variations. In section five we derive the Zinn-Justin equation which puts crucial constraints
on the QEA and its loop-wise expansion. In section six we finally demonstrate the perturbative renormalizability of the SO(1,3) gauge field theory
which marks a further key step towards a consistent quantum theory of
gravitation.
All fields in this paper are defined on Minkowski spacetime M4 ≡ (R4 ,η)
with points x ∈ M4 given in Cartesian coordinates. η = diag(−1, 1, 1, 1) is
the flat spacetime metric with which indices α, β, γ, . . . are raised and lowered. They appear in quantities defined on M4 which transform covariantly.
All other notations deployed in the paper are explained wherever they appear first.

Path Integral Quantization of the SO(1,3) Gauge
Field Theory

In this section we review some key elements of the SO(1,3) gauge field
theory equivalent to General Relativity developed in [1]. We then quantize
the theory and derive gauge-fixed path-integral representations for gaugeinvariant physical quantities applying the Faddeev-Popov-deWitt approach.
Let us start with the gauge-invariant path integral representing the expectation value of a physical observable O[B]

sure over gauge field space which is invariant under the gauge transformations Eqn.(17) below as demonstrated in Appendix B.

Note that the first terms −ω ηζ xζ ∂η . . . in all the variations above account

approach whilst δω xα = 0 [1].
By construction the action SG [B] in Eqn.(2) is the most general action of
dimension ≤ 4 in the gauge fields Bα γδ and their first and second derivatives
∂β Bα γδ , ∂η ∂β Bα γδ which is locally Lorentz invariant and renormalizable by
power-counting.

The actual proof of renormalizability delivered in this paper requires
the much more involved demonstration that counterterms needed to absorb
infinite contributions to the perturbative expansion of the effective action
of the full quantum theory are again of the form Eqn.(2) plus gauge-fixing
and ghost terms with possibly renormalized fields and coupling constants.

SG [B]+SG [B] coupled to scalar matter is equivalent to General Relativity
with a cosmological constant term as demonstrated in [1].
Let us go back to the path integral in Eqn.(1). It runs over all possible
gauge-equivalent field configurations thence counting a physically relevant
field configuration multiple times in the integration. In order to separate
the part of the integration related to gauge-invariance from the physically
relevant integration over gauge-non-equivalent field configurations we divide the configuration space {Bα γδ } into equivalence classes [Bαg γδ ] of fields
which are gauge-equivalent under the gauge transformation Eqn.(17). The
integrand in Eqn.(1) is then constant over a given equivalence class, and
the integral itself proportional to the infinite volume of the Lorentz gauge
group. In itself this poses no insurmountable problem when calculating
Eqn.(1) non-perturbatively. However, the quadratic part of the action SG
in Eqn.(2) as defined in [2] is not invertible due to zero eigenvalues related
to the gauge symmetry. So in order to perturbatively deal with calculating
integrals of the type of Eqn.(1) we have to factor out the volume of the
Lorentz gauge group in the integration.
Following the Faddeev-Popov-deWitt approach [3, 4] we introduce

vacuum persistence amplitude W [J, K] in the presence of external currents
J and K for the fundamental fields χn and their BRST variations sχn respectively [3].
Let us introduce the shorthand notation χn for the fundamental fields

interacting field operators from which the S-matrix is derived via the LSZ
approach. Also, Γ [χ, 0] is the usual quantum effective action which contains
all connected one-particle irreducible graphs of the interacting theory in the
presence of the current Jχ,0 .
The condition referred to above, a Slavnov-Taylor identity, follows from
the BRST invariance of W [0, 0] for vanishing currents J, K which is easy

Perturbative Renormalizability of the Quantum
Effective Action Γ [χ, K]

In this section we prove the renormalizability of our theory closely following the approach outlined in [3]. First, we use renormalizability in the Dyson
sense to derive the explicit K-dependence of ΓN,∞ [χ, K] which contains the
infinite contributions of order N to the loop expansion of the effective action
P
Γ [χ, K] = ∞
N =0 ΓN [χ, K]. Second, evaluating the Zinn-Justin equation we
(ε)n
n (x) to be nilpotent with D n
find the combination ∆N (x) ≡ ∆n (x) + ε DN
N
(ε)
properly defined below, and the combination ΓN [χ] ≡ SR [χ] + ε ΓN,∞ [χ, 0]
to be invariant under the renormalized BRST field variations δθ(ε) χn (x) =
(ε)n
θ ∆N (x). This will finally allow us to prove the renormalizablity of our
theory.

6.1

K-dependence of ΓN,∞ [χ, K]

In this subsection we use the renormalizability of our theory in the Dyson
sense to derive the explicit K-dependence of ΓN,∞ [χ, K] which contains the
infinite contributions of order N to the loop expansion of the effective action
P
Γ [χ, K] = ∞
N =0 ΓN [χ, K].
We start by noting that ST OT [χ] is by construction a sum of integrals
over Lagrangians of dimension four or less expressed in the fundamental
fields χn – in fact it is the most general BRST-invariant action of dimension
four or less in those fields. As a consequence power-counting allows to show
that the corresponding quantum effective action of the quantized theory only
contains divergent contributions of dimension four or less in those fields –
or is renormalizable in the Dyson sense [5]. They then can be cancelled by
counterterms of dimensionality four or less.
However, there is more to full renormalizability. The action used in
the path integral or canonical quantization of our gauge field theory is constrained by BRST invariance – in fact it is the most general BRST-invariant
17

action of dimension four or less in all the dynamical fields. For the quantum
theory to be renormalizable, i.e. all infinities to be absorbable solely by
field renormalizations and coupling redefinitions, the infinite contributions
to the quantum effective action and the counterterms needed to cancel them
have to satisfy the same BRST constraints up to such renormalizations of
fields and couplings – which guarantees that the counterterms must be of
the same form as the terms in the original action. In other words BRST
invariance and the resulting Zinn-Justin equation are enough of an algebraic
”straightjacket” to assure renormalizability.
The first of a sequence of steps to prove full renormalizability is to determine the K-dependence of the infinite contributions to the effective action
Γ [χ, K] deploying dimensional analysis.
Based on the Dyson renormalizability we can rewrite the action S[χ, K]
in the presence of sources K as
S[χ, K] = ST OT [χ] +

where masses and coupling constants in SR [χ, K] are set to their renormalized values plus the correction S∞ [χ, K] containing all the counterterms
needed to cancel infinities from loop graphs in the perturbative loop expansion of the effective action Γ [χ, K]
Γ [χ, K] =

∞
X

ΓN [χ, K].

(74)

N =0

Above ΓN contains all the diagrams with N loops, plus contributions from
graphs with N − M loops, 1 ≤ M ≤ N , involving the counterterms in S∞
introduced to cancel infinities in graphs with M loops. Note that no source
term Kh γδ for ∆h γδ = 0 appears.
The power-counting rules of renormalization theory imply that after all
infinities in subgraphs of ΓN have been cancelled the infinite part ΓN,∞ [χ, K]
of ΓN [χ, K] must be an integral over a sum of local products of fields χ, K
and their derivatives of dimension four or less [5].
Now it is possible to determine the K-dependence of the infinite contributions to the effective action Γ [χ, K]. To that end we first establish
the dimensions of the various fields. If the fields χn have dimensionality
18

[χn ] ≡ dn then inspection of Eqns.(57) shows that the dimensionality of ∆n
is [∆n ] = dn + 1 and Kn has dimensionality [Kn ] = 4 − [∆n ] = 3 − dn .
So we find the dimensionalities for the various fields to be
[B] = [ω] = [ω ∗ ] = 1,
[h] = [KB ] = [Kω ] = [Kω∗ ] = 2,

(75)

[ψ] = 3/2, [Kψ ] = 3/2,
where we assume the matter field ψ to be a spin- 12 Dirac fermion. The
dimension four quantity ΓN,∞ [χ, K] can then be at most quadratic in any
of the Kn , and terms quadratic in any of the Kn cannot involve any other
fields with the exception of a term quadratic in Kψ which may contain one
additional field of dimension one.
Using ghost number conservation we next demonstrate ΓN,∞ [χ, K] to be
at most linear in Kn . If the fields χn have ghost number |χn | ≡ gn then
inspection of Eqns.(57) shows that the ghost number of ∆n is |∆n | = gn + 1
and Kn has ghost number |Kn | = −|∆n | = −gn − 1.
So we find the ghost numbers for the various fields to be
|B| = |ψ| = |h| = 0,

|ω| = 1,
∗

|Kω | = −2,

|ω | = −1,

|KB | = |Kψ | = −1,

(76)

|Kω∗ | = 0.

This rules out all potential contributions to ΓN,∞ [χ, K] of second order in
Kn with the exception of a potential term of second order in Kω∗ . Now as

of Kω∗ the effective action Γ [χ, K] is linear in Kω∗ through
R
a term − d4 x Kω∗ γδ hγδ and the ΓN,∞ [χ, K] are independent of Kω∗ for
N ≥ 1.
Note that the last equality in Eqn.(77) above follows from the fact that
for transformations

the field variation hF n [χm ]iJχ,K ,K equals its classical value F n [χm ] as is
easily shown in a calculation analogous to the one in Eqn.(63).
In fact, if the effective action Γ [χ, K] is invariant under a variation with

Renormalized BRST Invariance forcing ΓN [χ] to be of
the Form of the original Action ST OT up to possible Field
Renormalizations and Coupling Redefinitions

In this subsection we determine the most general form of the renormalized
(ε)
action ΓN [χ] invariant A) under all the linear symmetry operations under
which the original action is invariant and B) under the renormalized BRST
(ε)n
variations ∆N [χ; x] determined in the preceding subsection.
Let us turn to the final step in our renormalization proof: the demonstration that the most general form of the renormalized action invariant
under i) all the linear symmetry operations under which the original action
(ε)n
is invariant as well as under ii) the renormalized BRST variations ∆N [χ; x]
is of the form of our original BRST-invariant action ST OT up to potential
field and coupling constant renormalizations.
We start with the N -th order contribution to the corrected renormalized
(ε)
action ΓN [χ] ≡ SR [χ] + ε ΓN,∞ [χ, 0] which contains the original renormalized action plus the infinite part of the N -loop contributions to the quantum

it must be the integral over local terms in the dynamical fields and their

with cγδ an arbitrary constant antisymmetric Lorentz tensor – which is a

adds nothing but a total divergence.
Next we turn to determine the most general form of the renormalized
action invariant under all the linear symmetry operations A) to C) under which the original action is invariant. Recalling the dimensionalities
and ghost numbers of the various fields from subsection 6.1 we first note
that ghost number conservation requires that ω and ω ∗ come in pairs, and
antighost invariance that ω ∗ comes together with a derivative ω ∗ ∂ which we
can always shuffle to the left of any other expression in the fields. Alltogether any pair of ω and ω ∗ ∂ carries dimension three, so there cannot be
(ε)
more than one such pair in ΓN [χ] and such a pair can come with only one

Turning to δθ(ε) SB,ψ [χ] we first note that the renormalized BRST variations for the gauge and matter fields Eqns.(95) and (94) are nothing but

(112)

Because terms from δθ(ε) SB,ψ [χ] will not contain any h or ω ∗ they cannot
mix with the terms discussed above and we separately have to have
δθ(ε) SB,ψ [χ] = 0

(113)

which means that SB,ψ [χ] must be locally gauge-invariant under the renormalized gauge transformations defined by the BRST variations Eqns.(94)
27

to (98) for B and ψ with renormalized gauge parameter and gauge algebra
generators as in Eqns.(111) and (112).
As the gauge field action SG [B] in Eqn.(2) is by construction the most
general gauge-invariant action of dimension four or less we conclude that
(ε)
the most general ΓN [χ] compatible with renormalized BRST invariance is

where S̃.. indicates that all gauge algebra generators J in S.. have been replaced by the rescaled generators J˜ as in Eqn.(112). Above we have assumed
that SM and as a consequence S̃M is the most general renormalizable Dirac
matter action coupled to the gauge field.
Inspection of Eqn.(114) shows that apart from the appearance of new
(ε)
constants ΓN [χ] is functionally the same expression in the dynamical fields
as is the action ST OT given by Eqn.(100) with which we have started.
By adjusting the N -th order terms in the corresponding constants in the
original unrenormalized action all the new constants may be absorbed in SR
so that finally
(ε)

ΓN [χ] = SR [χ] + ε ΓN,∞ [χ, 0] = SR [χ].

(115)

For this particular choice of renormalized constants in SR [χ] we then have
ΓN,∞ [χ, 0] = 0.

Conclusions

In two preceding papers we have developed a classical theory of gravitation
equivalent to GR, yet free from the well-known flaws of GR when it comes
to quantization [1], and we have canonically quantized the non-interacting
28

gauge field of that theory and defined the corresponding relativisticallyinvariant physical Fock space of positive-norm, positive-energy particle states
[2].
In this paper we have given full proof of the renormalizability of the quantized theory. In fact we have proven the renormalizability of the perturbatively defined QEA in essence following the steps usually taken to prove the
renormalizability of the QEA of the Standard Model of particle physics. As
in that case the ghosts and antighosts appearing as a byproduct of gaugefixing the path integral expressions for the Green functions of the theory decouple, and the S-matrix is as a result unitary – in our case on the naı̈ve Fock
space of both positive-norm, positive-energy and negative-norm, negativeenergy states related to only the gauge field, and on the physical Fock spaces
related to possible other physical fields.
The last step to be taken in consistently quantizing gravitation will be
the demonstration of the unitarity of the S-Matrix on the physical Fock
space for the gauge field.
And then more real work starts: what about asymptotic freedom versus
the observability of the gravitational interaction – or the β-function of the
theory determining the running of the gauge coupling? What about instantons which definitely exist in the Euclidean version of the theory given that
SO(4) = SU(2) × SU(2), and anomalies? And what about the interplay
(2)
(4)
of SG [B] and SG [B] whereby the former dominates the gravitational interaction at long distances or in the realm of classical physics and the latter
at the short distances governing quantum physics? And what about the
gravitational quanta implied by the latter already in the non-interacting
theory? Could they be at the origin of dark energy – forming a cosmological
radiation background consisting of gravitational quanta in analogy to the
CMB – and helping to resolve the mystery surrounding 70% of the observed
energy content of the Universe? And in that process nicely feeding back as
(0)
a sort of cosmological constant into SG [B] in the current Standard Model
of Cosmology at a phenomenological level? And . . .?
Finally let us take a step back from the more technical aspects and look
at the potentially emerging holistic understanding of the four fundamental
interactions.
Also in the case of gravitation it seems fruitful to take the historically
superbly successful approach to fundamental physics starting with a set of
conservations laws based on observations, then evoking Emmy Noether’s
miraculous theorem linking such conservation laws to global symmetries

29

of local field theories and finally uncovering a related force field and its
dynamics by gauging the global symmetry.
So what the observed conservation of the electric, weak and colour
charges have done for the formulation of the Standard Model the observed
conservation of angular momentum and the observed uniformity of the speed
of light across all Lorentz frames of motion might indeed do for the formulation of a consistent quantum theory of gravitation - and its inclusion in
the existing Standard Model of particle physics.
In that case both A) working from the conservation of energy-momentum
and B) geometrizing gravitation might ultimately prove to have been optical
illusions too close to reality to be easily recognized as such, but not close
enough to provide the final keys to quantize gravitation.
Hence, there might be no ”World Formula” finally, but there might be
very well a consistent framing of all physics across the four observed fundamental interactions and it seems that a programme started long ago resulting in the Standard Model of particle physics might eventually come to its
ultimate fruition by seamlessly including Gravitation.

The so(1,3) Lorentz Gauge Algebra

In this section we introduce notations and normalizations for the so(1,3)
Lorentz gauge algebra central to this work.
The so(1,3) Lie or Lorentz gauge algebra is defined by the commutation
relations
[Jαβ , Jγδ ] = i{ηαγ Jβδ − ηβγ Jαδ + ηβδ Jαγ − ηαδ Jβγ }

+ ηδζ (ηγα ηηβ − ηηα ηγβ ) − ηαζ (ηδα ηηβ − ηηα ηδβ ) (117)
= Cηζ αβ γδ = Cγδ ηζ αβ .

The Cαβ γδ ηζ are antisymmetric in all the pairs of indices Cβα γδ ηζ =
−Cαβ γδ ηζ = . . ., antisymmetric in exchanging two adjacent pairs of indices
Cγδ αβ ηζ = −Cαβ γδ ηζ = . . . and subject to the Jacobi identity
C γδ αβ ηζ C ηζ ρσ τ χ + C γδ ρσ ηζ C ηζ τ χ αβ + C γδ τ χ ηζ C ηζ αβ ρσ = 0

(118)

which follows from
[Jαβ , [Jρσ , Jτ χ ]] + cycl. perm. = [Jαβ , i C ηζ ρσ τ χ Jηζ ] + cycl. perm. (119)
= i2 C ηζ ρσ τ χ C γδ αβ ηζ Jγδ + cycl. perm. = 0.
Let us next we display three sets of so(1,3) generators regularly appearing throughout the paper, namely:
A) the generators of infinitesimal gauge transformations acting on spacetime
