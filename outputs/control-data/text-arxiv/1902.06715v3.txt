We show that supersymmetry is anomalous in N = 1 superconformal quantum field theories
(SCFTs) with an anomalous R-symmetry. This anomaly was originally found in holographic SCFTs
at strong coupling. Here we show that this anomaly is present in general and demonstrate it for the
massless superconformal Wess-Zumino model via an one loop computation. The anomaly appears
first in four-point functions of two supercurrents with either two R-currents or with an R-current
and an energy momentum tensor. In fact, the Wess-Zumino consistency conditions together with
the standard R-symmetry anomaly imply the existence of the anomaly. We outline the implications
of this anomaly.

Anomalies of symmetries play an important role in
quantum field theories. If a global symmetry is anomalous, classical selection rules are not respected in the
quantum theory and classically forbidden processes may
occur. This is a feature of the theory and it is linked
with observable effects. For example, the axial anomaly
explains the π 0 decay and leads to the resolution of the
U (1) problem in QCD [1, 2]. On the other hand, anomalies in local (gauge) symmetries lead to inconsistencies,
such as lack of unitarity, and they must be canceled.
An important corollary is that anomalous global symmetries cannot be consistently coupled to corresponding
local symmetries. Reviews on anomalies in quantum field
theories may be found in [3, 4].
Anomalies in supersymmetric theories.— In this paper we discuss a new anomaly in four-dimensional supersymmetric quantum field theories with an anomalous
R-symmetry: global supersymmetry itself is anomalous.
This anomaly was discovered in the context of superconformal theories that can be realised holographically [5].
Here we show that the same anomaly arises in perturbation theory in the simplest supersymmetric model: the
free superconformal Wess-Zumino (WZ) model.
An anomaly may be detected either by putting the theory on a non-trivial background, or by computing correlation functions on a flat background and checking whether
the Ward identities are satisfied. The latter method was
the one that led to the original discovery of anomalies
via one-loop triangle diagrams [1, 2]. Here we will carry
out the analogous computation for the supersymmetry
anomaly. The anomaly is associated in particular with
anomalous one-loop contributions to four-point correlation functions between two supersymmetry currents and
two R-currents or an R-current and an energy momentum tensor. We will discuss the former in the free superconformal WZ model but analogous contributions would
arise in any supersymmetric theory with a (softly broken)
anomalous R-symmetry. Actually, as will be sketched below and is shown in detail in the companion paper [6],
the WZ consistency conditions [7] together with the stan-

dard triangle anomalies imply that supersymmetry must
be anomalous.
Discussion of anomalies in 4d (super)conformal QFT
has a long history. It has been known since the 1970s
[8, 9] that the trace of the stress tensor Tµµ is anomalous
in the presence of a curved background metric gµν and
background source Aµ for a chiral current Jµ , and the
R-current is similarly anomalous. Moreover, there are
generally mixed anomalies involving two energy momentum tensors and a chiral current [10, 11]. It has also been
known since [12] that the currents sit in a supermultiplet,
as do the anomalies. In particular, the trace anomaly and
the R-current anomaly are in the same multiplet as the
gamma trace of the supercurrent, γ µ Qµ . The latter is
an anomaly in the conservation of the special supersymmetry current, xν γν Qµ . It follows that special supersymmetry (sometimes also called S-supersymmetry) is
anomalous. It was believed however that supersymmetry
itself (sometimes called Q-supersymmetry) is preserved,
i.e. the conservation of Qµ is non-anomalous.
There have been extensive studies in the past regarding anomalies in supersymmetry. It was realised early on
[13–18] that one cannot maintain at the quantum level simultaneously ∂ µ Qµ = 0 and γ µ Qµ = 0 and, if the model
is a gauge theory, gauge invariance: one of the three conditions must be relaxed and the standard choice is to
have a superconformal anomaly. This is the standard superconformal anomaly mentioned above and is distinct
from the anomaly discussed here. Also distinct is the
Konishi anomaly [19, 20], which is a superspace version
of the chiral anomaly in supersymmetric gauge theories.
Another set of studies, reviewed in [21], considers
the effective action for elementary fields and examines
whether it is invariant under supersymmetry including
loop effects; it investigates the conservation of the supercurrent inside correlators of elementary fields and/or
solves the WZ consistency conditions relevant for this
setup, and finds no supersymmetry anomaly. This does
not contradict the results we present below: to find the
anomaly one should either put the theory on a non-

2
trivial background or consider correlation functions of
(classically) conserved currents1 . Studies involving correlators of currents have also appeared but typically only
discuss 3-point functions of bosonic currents. As mentioned above, the supersymmetry anomaly appears first
in 4-point functions involving two supercurrents and two
bosonic currents and to our knowledge these have not
been computed before.
Anomalies associated with correlation functions of conserved currents can be analysed by coupling the currents
to external sources, which in our case form an N = 1 superconformal multiplet. As such, the anomaly we discuss
here could be related to existing superspace results on
anomaly candidates for D = 4, N = 1 supergravity theories [22–26] (in particular, in type II anomalies in [25]),
though we emphasise that in our case the supergravity
fields are external and thus non-dynamical (off-shell).
A supersymmetry anomaly appears in super YangMills (SYM) theory in the WZ gauge when there are
gauge anomalies [27] (see also [28–30]). This anomaly is
easy to understand: in the WZ gauge, supersymmetry
transformations require a compensating gauge transformation and this transfers the anomaly from the gauge
sector to supersymmetry. When the SYM theory is consistent at the quantum level (i.e. the gauge anomalies
cancel) then supersymmetry is also non-anomalous. A
supersymmetry anomaly appears in theories with gravitational anomalies [31–33], as one may anticipate based
on the fact that the energy momentum tensor and the supercurrent are part of the same supermultiplet. Indeed
this supersymmetry anomaly sits in the same multiplet
as the gravitational anomaly.
Here we will discuss a supersymmetry anomaly in consistent QFTs (no gauge anomalies) which have a conserved energy momentum tensor. We also emphasise that
we are concerned with local anomalies, not with beta
functions.
Holographic anomalies.— The anomaly we discuss here
was first computed holographically [5]. In holography,
given a bulk action, one can use holographic renormalisation [34, 35] to compute the Ward identities and anomalies of the dual QFT. AdS/CFT relates N = 1 SCFT
in four dimensions to N = 2 gauged supergravity in
five dimensions. Starting from gauged supergravity in
an asymptotically locally AdS5 spacetime and turning
on sources for all superconformal currents one can compute the complete set of superconformal anomalies. This
computation is available for holographic CFTs, which in

1

To illustrate this point, consider a free fermion in a complex
representation in flat spacetime. This theory has a standard
axial anomaly originating from the 3-point function of the axial
current. However, if one only looks at correlators of elementary
fields these are non-anomalous and the axial current inside such
correlators is conserved.

particular means that the central charges should satisfy
a = c as N → ∞ [34].
Early attempts to compute the supertrace Ward identity can be found in [36, 37] but these missed contributions to the anomaly involving the R-symmetry current
and the Ricci tensor. Following the work of Pestun [38],
there was renewed interest in supersymmetric theories on
curved spacetimes and their holographic duals. The holographic anomalies for bosonic currents were computed
in [39], reproducing (and correcting) known field theory
results [40]. The full superconformal anomalies for the
N = 1 current multiplet were computed holographically
in [5], while [41] obtained the superconformal anomalies
in the presence of local supersymmetric scalar couplings.
An analogous holographic computation relevant to twodimensional SCFTs was reported in [42].
The holographic results leave open the possibility that
the anomaly is special to holographic theories at strong
coupling. In this Letter we show that this is not the
case. One could have anticipated the anomaly based
on the structure of the supersymmetric variation of the
supercurrent, which is of the schematic form δQµ ∼
γν T µν ε+C µνρ ∂ν Jρ ε, where C µνρ is a tensor constructed
from gamma matrices and the metric. The Ward identity
for the 4-point function involving two supercurrents and
two R-currents would then involve terms of the form
∂µx1 hQµ (x1 )Q¯ν (x2 )J κ (x3 )J λ (x4 )i
ν

κ

(1)
λ

∼ δ(x1 − x2 )hδ Q̄ (x2 )J (x3 )J (x4 )i + · · · ,
where the dots denote additional terms (the exact Ward
identity is given (9)). Using the variation of the supercurrent we find that the r.h.s. contains the 3-point function of three R-currents, which is anomalous, and correspondingly one may anticipate (1) will be anomalous.
Similarly, the same 4-point function but with one of the
R-currents replaced by an energy momentum tensor is
expected to be anomalous, since hJ T T i is anomalous.
To determine whether an anomaly appears or not we
need to carry out the computation explicitly. Before we
turn to this, we discuss the consistency condition that
the anomalies must satisfy.
Wess-Zumino consistency.— Let eaµ , Aµ and ψµ denote
the sources (vierbein, gauge field and gravitino) that couple to the superconformal currents and W [e, A, ψ] be the
generating functional of connected graphs. We define the

The transformation rules and the local algebra they satisfy are derived in [6] and are given in Table I.
Assuming the R-symmetry current has the standard
triangle anomalies (i.e. assuming the from of AR in Table II) the WZ consistency conditions (4) may be viewed
as equations to determine the remaining anomalies. This
computation is presented in [6] and the results are summarised in Table II. Note in particular that all anomalies are given in terms of the central changes a and c.
The anomalies of the bosonic currents are in agreement
with the results derived in [39, 40]. The supersymmetry
anomaly AQ that we discuss here is related to the Rsymmetry anomaly AR through the same descent equation that relates the supersymmetry anomaly discussed
in [27] to the corresponding gauge anomaly. However,
as noted earlier, there are important differences in the
physics (in [27] the gauge anomalies must vanish for consistency of the model, while this is not so for the Ranomalies relevant for us), as well as in the context (the
WZ conditions discussed in [27] are for a vector multiplet
in flat space, while the anomalies in Table II are those of
N = 1 conformal supergravity [6]).
Here we only discuss one of the WZ equations: the one
obtained by considering the commutator of R-symmetry
(with parameter θ) with Q-supersymmetry (with parameter ε):

One may wonder whether this anomaly can be removed
by adding a local counterterm Wct to the action such
that Wren = W + Wct is non-anomalous, i.e. δε Wren = 0.
Using the commutator of two supersymmetry variations,
[δε , δε0 ], given in Table I we find
(δξ + δλ + δθ )Wren = 0

⇒

(δξ + δλ )Wren 6= 0 , (6)

since δθ Wren = AR 6= 0. It follows that if one wishes
to preserve supersymmetry Wct must break diffeomorphisms and/or local Lorentz transformations.3 Next, we
calculate this anomaly by one-loop computations within
a specific model.

The conserved currents are given in Table III. We have
included improvement terms so that classically Tµµ =
0, γ µ Qµ = 0 and we are dealing with an N = 1 SCFT.
From the form of the anomaly AQ in Table II follows
that the first anomalous contribution in flat space correlators appears in 4-point functions involving two supercurrents and either two R-currents or an R-current and
an energy momentum tensor. Here we discuss the former,
referring to [44] for a detailed account of both cases.
Since we seek to investigate the possibility of a supersymmetry anomaly, we should not assume the existence
of a supersymmetric regulator: the one-loop computation should not be done in superspace.4 We will instead

Using the explicit form of AR it is easy to see that
δε AR 6= 0 and the WZ consistency condition requires
that AQ 6= 0. This argument does not rely on the theory
having conformal invariance, and thus we expect any 4d
supersymmetric theory with an R-symmetry anomaly to
have a corresponding anomaly in the conservation of the

This expectation has been verified in the followup paper [43].
Note that since AR is a genuine anomaly it is not possible to
set the r.h.s. of the second equation in (6) to zero using a local
counterterm. This implies that there are no further local counterterms that can restore diffeomeorphisms and local Lorentz
invariance.
On the other hand, the form of anomalies respects the symmetries they break and thus one may use superspace to analyse
possible anomaly candidates.

are expressed in terms of the supersymmetry variations
of the currents: δε Qµ =εδQµ +∂ν εδQ0µν and idem for J µ .
A similar Ward identity follows from R-invariance.
One-loop computation.— We now compute (9). Since
the theory is free the complete computation is one-loop.
The 4-point function receives contributions from three
classes of Feynman box diagrams, shown in Figure 1;
this computation is straightforward but tedious.

FIG. 1. Box diagrams contributing to the 4-point correlation
function (8). Zig-zag lines denote R-currents; wavy lines denote supersymmetry currents; straight lines denote fermionic
progagators and dashed lines denote bosonic propagators.

One may verify that (9), as well as the corresponding
R-symmetry Ward identity, are (naively) satisfied by a
simple shift of the loop momentum, much the same way
as the triangle Ward identity is naively satisfied. Again in
parallel with the triangle anomaly, (part of) the one-loop
contributions to the 4-point function are superficially linearly divergent. This implies that there is a momentum
routing ambiguity when using a momentum cut-off regulator (see for example Jackiw’s lectures in [3]).

5
We proceed by taking the ∂κx3 of (9) and subtracting from it the ∂µx1 derivative of the corresponding Rsymmetry Ward identity. By construction, the 4-point
functions cancel and one is left with an identity involving 3-point functions only (namely the terms appearing
on the r.h.s. of the Ward identities). Had these 3-point
functions been non-anomalous, this would be an identity. However, the 3-point functions involve the anomalous hJ J J i correlator and this implies that either (9)
or the corresponding R-symmetry Ward identity should
be anomalous. Assuming the form of the bosonic Ward
identities is standard (i.e. given by the expressions in Table II) the R-symmetry 4-point function Ward identity is
not anomalous and therefore the supersymmetry Ward
identity is anomalous. This computation is the counterpart of (5) but now in terms of Feynman diagrams.
One can then show that there is a momentum routing
such that 1) the triangle R-symmetry anomaly is reproduced; 2) the 4-point R-symmetry Ward identity is nonanomalous and 3) the supersymmetry Ward identity is
anomalous, with the anomaly given in Table II and with
c = 2a = 1/24, which are the values in our model. In
addition, upon taking the gamma trace of the same 4point function, γµ Qµ Q̄ν J κ J λ , one automatically reproduces the AS anomaly given in Table II.
In general, changing the momentum routing one may
move the anomaly from one conserved current to another.
This would be equivalent to adding local finite counterterms and as argued earlier there is no choice of such counterterms that would remove the supersymmetry anomaly
while preserving diffeomorphisms/local Lorentz transformations.
It is also straightforward to check that the same
anomaly is present in the massive WZ model as well.
As in the case of standard triangle anomalies, adding a
mass term modifies the Ward identities but the anomaly
remains the same. This is as expected since the anomaly
arises from the UV behaviour of Feynman diagrams and
the parts of the loop computation that give rise to the
anomaly remain the same.
Implications of the anomaly.— Let us conclude with
a few comments about the implications of this anomaly.
As mentioned earlier, an important consequence is that
a SQFT with such a supersymmetry anomaly cannot
be coupled to dynamical supergravity.5 In the context
of supersymmetric model building, one does not usually
work with theories with an R-symmetry, anomalous or
non-anomalous; non-anomalous R-symmetry is not compatible with gaugino masses (see [45]). More generally,
one does not expect a theory with continuous symmetry

5

The anomalous R-symmetry alone implies that coupling to a
supergravity that gauges the R-symmetry is inconsistent. Here
we see that couplings to supergravity that do not gauge the Rsymmetry are also inconsistent.

to emerge from a consistent quantum theory of gravity,
such as string theory. However, such models may be
considered in bottom-up approaches (see [46] for a recent example). Similar comments apply to bottom-up
string cosmology models. This anomaly also affects supersymmetric localisation computations, as has already
been noted in [5, 6, 41, 42]. However, it is possible that a
suitable non-covariant local counterterm6 may cancel the
rigid supersymmetry anomaly at the expense of breaking
certain diffeomorphisms on a given supersymmetric background. From a more formal perspective, it would be interesting to explore how the supersymmetry anomaly is
captured in index theorems. It would also be interesting
to investigate the existence of such an anomaly in other
dimensions and/or extended supersymmetry.

For theories with a = c such a counterterm evaluated on supersymmetric backgrounds of the form S 1 × M3 , with M3 a Seifert
