Abstract—Over-the-air computation (AirComp) becomes a
promising approach for fast wireless data aggregation via exploiting the superposition property in a multiple access channel. To
further overcome the unfavorable signal propagation conditions
for AirComp, in this paper, we propose an intelligent reflecting
surface (IRS) aided AirComp system to build controllable wireless environments, thereby boosting the received signal power
significantly. This is achieved by smartly tuning the phase shifts
for the incoming electromagnetic waves at IRS, resulting in
reconfigurable signal propagations. Unfortunately, it turns out
that the joint design problem for AirComp transceivers and
IRS phase shifts becomes a highly intractable nonconvex biquadratic programming problem, for which a novel alternating
difference-of-convex (DC) programming algorithm is developed.
This is achieved by providing a novel DC function representation
for the rank-one constraint in the low-rank matrix optimization
problem via matrix lifting. Simulation results demonstrate the
algorithmic advantages and admirable performance of the proposed approaches compared with the state-of-art solutions.

I. I NTRODUCTION
In the near future, it is anticipated that massive number
of Internet of things (IoT) devices and machines will be
connected to wireless networks to automate the operations of
our daily life, thereby providing intelligent services. To this
end, one critical challenge is the need of ultra-fast wireless
data aggregation, which pervades a wide range of applications
in massive machine type communication [1] and on-device
federated machine learning [2]. In particular, we need to
collect and process data distributed among a huge number
of devices rapidly by wireless communication techniques.
However, with enormous number of devices, conventional
interference-avoiding channel access schemes become infeasible since they normally result in low spectrum utilization
efficiency and excessive network latency [3]. To overcome
this challenge, a promising concurrent transmissions solution
named over-the-air computation (AirComp) was proposed via
exploiting the superposition property in a multiple access
channel [4]–[6].
There are extensive research works on investigating the
AirComp systems from the point of view of information theory
[4], signal processing [5], [7], and transceiver beamforming
design [3], [6], [8]. In particular, a uniform-forcing transceiver
design was developed in [6] via the successive convex approximation method to compensate the non-uniform fading of
different sensors. A novel transmitter design leveraging zeroforcing beamforming has recently been proposed in [8] to
compensate the non-uniform fading among different multiple

antennas at IoT devices. In [3], a multiple-input-multiple
output (MIMO) AirComp scheme was further investigated to
enable high-mobility multi-modal sensing. It showed that more
antennas at access point (AP) is able to reduce the performance
degradation in terms of mean-squared-error (MSE). However,
all these approaches are unable to control of the wireless
environments, where in some scenarios the harsh propagation
environments may result in significant deterioration of the
system performance [9]. For instance, high frequency (e.g.,
millimeter wave or terahertz) signals, which are expected to
play a key role in future communication systems, however,
may be blocked even by small objects [9].
To overcome unfavorable signal propagation conditions for
AirComp, in this paper, we propose to boost the performance
of AirComp by developing large intelligent reflecting surfaces
(IRS), which is envisioned to achieve high spectrum and
energy efficiency by controlling the communication environments [10], [11]. An IRS normally does not require any
dedicated energy source and can be integrated easily in the
surrounding walls of the transmitters [12], [13]. Specifically,
an IRS is generally composed of many small passive elements,
each of which is able to reflect a phase-shifted version of the
incident signal [12]–[15]. By intelligently tuning the phase
shifts, we are able to constructively combine reflected signals
with the non-reflected ones to boost the received signal power
drastically, thereby improving the achievable performance of
AirComp.
Although there is a growing body of recent works on
transmit beamforming and IRS phase shifts design [12], [13],
the transceiver design for AirComp raises unique challenges
due to the coupled design of the optimal phase shifts of a
large IRS. In this paper, we propose to jointly optimize the
transceiver and the phase shifts to minimize the MSE for AirComp. However, it turns out that the joint design problem for
AirComp transceivers and IRS phase shifts becomes a highly
intractable nonconvex bi-quadratic programming problem. In
order to address the coupled issue, we propose to optimize the
phase shifts and the decoding vector at the AP alternatively.
It turns out that the decoding vector design problem for
AirComp [3] and the phase shifts matrix design problem
for IRS [13] are both nonconvex quadratically constrained
quadratic programming (QCQP) problems.
A popular way to convexify the nonconvex QCQP problem
is to reformulate it as a rank-one constrained matrix optimization problem via matrix lifting, followed by the semidefinite

the target function f , AP needs to obtain the target-function

In this paper, we aim to recover this target-function variable by
exploiting the superposition property of a wireless multipleaccess channel.
To enhance the performance for over-the-air computation
by controlling the signal propagation environment, we shall
propose to deploy an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) on
a surrounding wall, thereby dynamically adjusting the phase
shift of each reflecting elements according to the channel
state information (CSI). In particular, the IRS controller can
switch between two operational modes, i.e., the receiving
mode for sensing the environment (e.g., CSI estimation) and
the reflecting mode for scattering the incident signals from the
users [13], [14]. The IRS has M elements, each of which rescatters the received incident signals with a phase shift and a

We consider a multi-user MISO communication system
consisting of K single-antenna users and an AP with N
antennas. In the scenario of over-the-air computation, the AP
aims to compute a target function of the aggregated data from
all users [3], [6] , as shown in Fig. 1. Specifically, let xk ∈ C
denote data generated at user k and ψk (·) : C → C denote the
pre-processing function of user k, the target function computed
at AP can be written in the form as

relaxation (SDR) technique to drop the nonconvex rank-one
constraint [16]. However, it was observed that the performance
of SDR approach degenerates in the scenarios with large
number of antennas due to its low probability of returning
rank-one solutions [2], [6], [17]. To address the limitations
of the popular SDR technique, in this paper, we develop a
general framework to solve the rank-one constrained matrix
optimization problem via difference-of-convex (DC) programming. This is achieved by providing a novel DC function
representation for the rank-one constraint, followed by a
majorization-minimization algorithm to solve the resulting DC
problem. Furthermore, simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed approach outperforms the SDR method significantly,
and large IRS is able to dramatically enhance the AirComp
performance.

represent the diagonal phase shifts matrix of the IRS with
θm ∈ [0, 2π] and β ∈ [0, 1] as the amplitude reflection
coefficient on the incident signals. In this paper, we assume
β = 1 without loss of generality. Furthermore, it is well known
that the power of signals reflected by twice or more times can
be ignored due to significant propagation loss [13]. Therefore,
the equivalent uplink channel between users and AP consists
of three components, i.e., AP-user link, IRS-user link, and
IRS-AP link as show in Fig. 1. Additionally, we assume all the
involved channels are constant during a block of transmission.
Let hdk ∈ CN , hrk ∈ CM , and G ∈ CN ×M be the equivalent
channels from user k to the AP, from user k to the IRS, and
from IRS to the AP, respectively. The received signal at AP

optimal transceivers wk ’s, m, and the phase shifts matrix Θ.
Given the decoding vector m and the phase shifts matrix

Although problem (13) is nonconvex and inhomogeneous, it
can be reformulated as a homogeneous nonconvex QCQP
problem [13]. Specifically, by introducing an auxiliary variable
t, we can equivalently rewrite problem (13) as

to satisfy the power constraint (4) on each transmitter scalar.
Given the optimal transmitter scalars wk ’s and the normalizing factor η, the MSE can be further rewritten as
σ 2 kmk2

MSE =

(11)

However, problem P turns out to be highly intractable due to
the nonconvex quadratic constraints with respect to m and Θ.
In Section III, we shall leverage the alternating minimization
approach to solve this problem. A novel alternating DC
programming algorithm is further developed in Section IV.

Obviously, if ṽ ∗ = [v 0 , t0 ]T is a feasible solution to problem
(14), then we can obtain a feasible solution to problem (13)
as v ∗ = v 0 /t0 . The phase shifts matrix Θ∗ can be recovered
from v ∗ trivially. Note that problem (12) is always feasible,
while the feasibility of problem (14) may not be guaranteed.
We thus terminate the alternating algorithm either problem
(14) becomes infeasible during the iterative procedure or the
difference between the MSE of consecutive iterations is less
than a predefined threshold.
To summarize, we propose to solve the nonconvex biquadratic problem P by seeking the optimal solution to
problem (12) and problem (14) in an alternative manner.
Although both problem (12) and problem (14) are still non
convex, we shall reveal the algorithmic advantages in the
following sections.

On the other hand, for a given decoding vector m, problem
P is reduced to a feasibility detection problem. Specifically,
let mH hdk = ck and vm = ejθm , m = 1, · · · , M , we have

To address the nonconvexity issue of problem (12) and problem (14), a natural way is to reformulate them as semidefinite
programming (SDP) problems by the matrix lifting technique
[16]. Specifically, by defining M = mmH , which lifts the
vector m into a positive semidefinite (PSD) matrix with
rank(M ) = 1, problem (12) can be equivalently reformulated
as the following low-rank matrix optimization problem
P1 :

subject to

Tr(M Hk ) ≥ 1, ∀k,
M  0, rank(M ) = 1,

(16)

where Hk = hek (hek )H .
Similarly, we also adopt the matrix lifting technique to
reformulate the nonconvex quadratic constraints in problem
(14). Specifically, let V = ṽṽ H and note that ṽ H Rk ṽ =

Tr(Rk ṽṽ H ). Problem (14) can be equivalently written as the
following low-rank matrix optimization problem

C. Problem Analysis
To further address the nonconvexity in problem P1 and
problem P2 , one popular way is to simply drop the nonconvex
rank-one constraints via the SDR technique [16]. The resulting
SDP problems can be solved efficiently by existing convex
optimization solvers such as CVX [18]. If the optimal solution
to the SDP problem is rank-one, the optimal solution to the
original problem can be recovered by rank one decomposition.
On the other hand, if the optimal solution of the SDP problem
fails to be rank-one, additional steps such as Gaussian randomization [16] need to be applied to extract a suboptimal solution
for the original problem. However, it was observed that for the
high-dimensional optimization problems (e.g., the number of
antennas N increases), the probability of returning a rank-one
solution for the SDR approach becomes low, which yields
significant performance deterioration [6], [17]. To overcome
the limitations of the SDR methods, we instead propose a
novel DC framework in the following section to solve problem
P1 and problem P2 .
IV. A LTERNATING DC A LGORITHM
In this section, we will introduce a novel DC representation for the rank function, following by leveraging the
majorization-minimization technique to iteratively solve the
resulting DC problems.
A. DC Framework for Rank-One Constraint Problems
For ease of presentation, we first consider the DC algorithm
for general low-rank matrix optimization problems with a
rank-one constraint as follows,
minimize
X∈C

subject to

SDR method, we propose to add the DC function in (19) into
the objective function as a penalty component, yielding

Tr(A0 X)
Tr(Ak X) ≥ dk , ∀k,
X  0, rank(X) = 1,

(18)

where the constraint set C is convex. A key observation on
the rank-one constraint is that it can be equivalently written
as a DC function constraint, which is formally stated in the
following proposition [2].
Proposition 1. For positive semidefinite (PSD) matrix X ∈
CN ×N and Tr(X) ≥ 1, we have
rank(X) = 1 ⇐⇒ Tr(X) − kXk2 = 0,
(19)
PN
where trace norm Tr(X) = i=1 σi (X) and spectral norm
kXk2 = σ1 (X) with σi (X) denoting the i-th largest singular
value of matrix X.
In order to enhance a low rank solution for problem (18),
instead of removing the nonconvex rank-one constraint via the

Tr(A0 X) + ρ · (Tr(X) − kXk2 )
Tr(Ak X) ≥ dk , ∀k,
X  0,

subject to

(20)

where ρ > 0 is the penalty parameter. Note that we are able to
obtain an exact rank-one solution X ∗ when the nonnegative
component (Tr(X ∗ ) − kX ∗ k2 ) in the objective function is
enforced to be zero.
B. DC Algorithm
Although problem (20) is still nonconvex, it can be solved in
an iterative manner by leveraging majorization-minimization
techniques, yielding a DC algorithm [19]. The main idea is to
transform problem (20) into a series of simple subproblems
by linearizing the concave term −ρkXk2 in the objective
function. Specifically, we need to solve the subproblem at
iteration t which is given by
minimize Tr(A0 X) + ρ · hX, I − ∂kX t−1 k2 i
X∈C

subject to

Tr(Ak X) ≥ dk , ∀k,
X  0,

(21)

where X t−1 is the optimal solution of the subproblem at
iteration t − 1. It is clear that the subproblem (21) is convex
and can be solved efficiently by existing solvers such as CVX
[18]. In addition, the subgradient ∂kXk2 can be computed
efficiently by the following proposition [2].
Proposition 2. For given PSD matrix X ∈ CN ×N , the subgradient ∂kXk2 can be computed as v1 v1H , where v1 ∈ CN
is the leading eigenvector of matrix X.
The presented DC algorithm converges to critical points
of problem (20) from arbitrary initial points [19]. We thus
summarize the presented DC algorithm in Algorithm 1.

end
end

C. Proposed Alternating DC Approach
In this subsection, we apply the proposed DC framework to
problem P1 and problem P2 . Specifically, to find a rank-one
solution to problem P1 , we propose to solve the following
DC programming problem
minimize
M

subject to

Tr(M ) + ρ(Tr(M ) − kM k2 )
Tr(M Hk ) ≥ 1, ∀k,
M  0,

(22)

where ρ > 0 is the penalty parameter. When the penalty
component is enforced to be zero, problem (22) shall induce a
rank-one solution M ? , we can thus recover the solution m to
problem (12) through Cholesky decomposition M ? = mmH .
To detect feasibility for problem P2 , we propose to minimize the difference between trace norm and spectral norm as
follows,
Tr(V ) − kV k2

minimize
V

subject to

Tr(Rk V ) + c2k ≥ 1, ∀k,
Vn,n = 1, ∀n = 1, · · · , N,
V  0.

(23)

When the objective value of problem (23) becomes zero, we
shall find an exact rank-one optimal solution V ? . By Cholesky
decomposition V ? = ṽṽ H , we can obtain a feasible solution
ṽ to problem (14). If the objective value fails to be zero, we
claim that problem P2 (i.e., problem (14)) is infeasible.
In summary, the proposed alternating DC algorithm for
solving problem P can be presented in Algorithm 2.
Algorithm 2: Proposed Alternating DC Algorithm for
Problem P.
Input : Initial point Θ1 , threshold  > 0.
for t = 1, 2, · · · do
For given Θt , solve problem P1 by Algorithm 1 to obtain
the solution M t .
For given M t , solve problem P2 by Algorithm 1 to
obtain the solution Θt+1 .
if The decrease of the MSE is below  or problem P2
becomes infeasible. then
break

V. S IMULATIONS
In this section, we conduct numerical experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed alternating DC algorithm
for solving problem P and the effectiveness of IRS for the
over-the-air computation systems.

A. Simulation Settings
We consider a three-dimensional (3D) coordinate system
with a uniform linear array of antennas at the AP and a uniform

rectangular array of passive reflecting elements at the IRS,
respectively. The AP and the IRS are respectively located at
(0, 0, 25) meters and (50, 50, 40) meters, while the users are
are uniformly located at region [−50, 50] × [50, 150] meters
as illustrated in Fig. 2. We consider the following pass loss

L(d) = T0 ( )−α ,
(24)

where T0 is the path loss at the reference distance d0 = 1m, d
is the link distance and α is the path loss exponent. In simulations, we set T0 = 30dB, and the path loss exponent α for APuser link, AP-IRS link and IRS-user link are respectively set to
be 3.5, 2.2, 2.8. In addition, we assume Rayleigh fading for all
the considered channels.

are given by hk = L(dk )γ and hk = L(dk )γ r , where
γ d ∼ CN (0, I), γ r ∼ CN (0, I), Here, ddk and drk are the
distance between user k and AP, the distance between
p user
k and IRS, respectively. The channel matrix G = L(d)Γ,
where Γ ∼ CN (0, I) and d is the distance between AP and
IRS. The average transmit signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) P0 /σ 2
is set to be 30 dB. The other parameters are set as follows:
ρ = 5,  = 10−3 ,dc = 10−8 .
We compare our proposed alternating DC algorithm with
the alternating SDR method for solving problem P, i.e., the
SDR method is adopted to solve both problem P1 [16] and
problem P2 [13]. For the SDR method, we remove the rankone constraint in problem P1 and problem P2 and solve
them alternatively via CVX [18], and we stop it when the
difference between the MSE of consecutive iterations is below
 or the SDR approach fails to return a feasible solution
to problem (14). Since the SDR method does not generally
return a rank-one solution, we apply Gaussian randomization
techniques [16] when we fail to obtain a rank-one solution. We
also illustrate the results given by random phase shift method
as the baseline. That is, to solve problem P, we choose a
fixed random phase shifts matrix Θ and minimize the MSE
by solving problem P1 via proposed DC Algorithm 1.
B. Simulation Results
We show the convergence behavior of the proposed alternating DC algorithm and alternating SDR method in Fig. 3(a)
under the setting: K = 16, M = 30, N = 20. It demonstrates
that the alternating SDR method stops at the third iteration
since it fails to find a feasible solution to problem (14)
even with Gaussian randomization techniques. However, the
proposed alternating DC algorithm is able to induce exact
rank-one optimal solutions, thereby accurately detecting the
feasibility of problem (14). This yields good performance with
a small MSE overall.
We compare in Fig. 3(b) the MSE versus different numbers
of the AP antennas N . The number of elements at IRS is fixed
to M = 15 and the number of users is K = 8. Each point
in Fig. 3(b) is averaged over 100 channel realizations. As can
be seen from Fig. 3(b), the MSE decreases significantly as
N increases, which indicates more antennas at AP will bring
better performance for AirComp. Furthermore, the proposed

alternating DC approach significantly outperforms alternating
SDR methods and the baseline.
We further compare in Fig. 3(c) the MSE versus different
number of IRS elements M with fixed N = 10, K = 8. Each
point in Fig. 3(c) is averaged over 100 channel realizations.
From Fig. 3(c), it illustrates that as M increases, the MSE
decreases significantly, which indicates that IRS with larger
number of elements is able to achieve smaller MSE. In
addition, the proposed alternating DC approach outperforms
alternating SDR methods significantly.
Finally, we compare the performance between AirComp
with IRS and the one without IRS. We fix the number of
the AP antennas N = 8. For the case without IRS, we set
the phase shifts matrix Θ = 0 in problem P, and minimize
the MSE by solving problem (22) using the proposed DC
Algorithm 1. For the case with IRS, we fix the the number
of the IRS elements M = 15. We illustrate the results of
the MSE versus the number of users in Fig. 3(d), and each
point is averaged over 100 channel realizations. It shows
that the MSE performance of the case without IRS is bad,
which suggests that deploying IRS in AirComp system can
significantly enhance its performance.
VI. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we proposed to leverage the large intelligent
surfaces to boost the performance for over-the-air computation,
thereby achieving ultra-fast data aggregation. To find the
optimal transceiver and phase shifts design, we proposed
an alternating minimization based approach, which results
in solving the nonconvex QCQP problems alternatively. To
overcome the nonconvexity issue, we further reformulated the
QCQP problems as a rank-one constrained matrix optimization
problem via matrix lifting, followed by a novel DC framework
to address the nonconvex rank-one constraints. Simulation results demonstrated the admirable performance of the proposed
approaches compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.
