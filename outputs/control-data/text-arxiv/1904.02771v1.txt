An acoustic topological insulator (TI) is synthesized using topology optimization, a free material inverse design
method. The TI appears spontaneously from the optimization process without imposing requirements on the
existence of pseudo spin-1/2 states at the TI interface edge, or the Chern number of the topological phases.
The resulting TI is passive; consisting of acoustically hard members placed in an air background and has an
operational bandwidth of ≈12.5% showing high transmission. Further analysis demonstrates confinement of
more than 99% of the total field intensity in the TI within at most six lattice constants from the TI interface.
The proposed design hereby outperforms a reference from recent literature regarding energy transmission, field
confinement and operational bandwidth.

The concept of the topological insulator (TI) stems from condensed matter physics and the quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE)
[1, 2]. Following these seminal works, a growing effort has been dedicated to understanding and designing TIs [3, 4], with
works demonstrating the engineering of TIs within the fields of photonics [5–12], solid mechanics [13–15] and acoustics [16–
20] alike. This surge in interest is partly fuelled by the incredible promise that TIs can provide backscattering protected, edgestate confined, one-way energy transport, robust under a class of structural defects. Such properties are obviously of broad
interest, with numerous applications able to benefit from backscattering protected energy transport, a recent example being
lasing [21]. Three fundamentally different systems for TIs are known: time-reversal breaking; time-reversal invariant; and
Floquet topological systems, each providing different modes of operation [22]. This letter considers the time-reversal invariant
setting in acoustics, allowing for backscattering protected spin-dependent directional energy transport, robust towards defects,
as illustrated in Fig. 1(a).
Acoustic systems intrinsically possess spin-0, thus no Kramers doublets exist, hindering the manifestation of the acoustic
QSHE. This barrier can be overcome by constructing artificial acoustic spin-1/2 states, e.g. by creating circulating acoustic
waves, actively [17] utilizing airflow or passively [18] by engineering an accidental double Dirac cone through a change in
the filling factor of cylindrical metallic rods in a honeycomb lattice. In [18] a time-reversal invariant acoustic TI is engineered
and shown to support topologically protected edge-states in a ≈1.5 kHz wide bulk-bandgap. The TI is demonstrated to largely
suppress backscattering, with the measured transmission dropping at most 5 dB and to perform robustly under geometric defects,
showing a maximum drop in transmission of 4 dB.
As outlined above, significant effort has been invested in the design of TIs, leading to excellent results and new discoveries.
The design procedures have, however, hitherto mainly been based on intuition, and the bottom-up approach of band-structure
engineering. Such approaches do not consider the finite size of the physical structure, disregarding the coupling into and out
of the TI. Further, approaches based on intuition are unlikely to lead to optimal designs, possibly leaving a large performance
potential untapped.
Inspired by the work in [18] this letter proposes a fundamentally different, optimization based approach for the design of
topological insulators. A top-down approach based on inverse design where the backscattering protected energy transport is
targeted directly, with no explicit requirements on the underlying mechanisms or geometries. Hence, the approach does not
impose requirements on the pre-existence of acoustic pseudo spin-1/2 edge-states; nor on the Chern numbers of the two involved
topological phases; nor on band symmetry inversion in reciprocal space. These properties appear spontaneously during the
design process. A TI designed using the proposed approach, is analysed and demonstrated to suppress backscattering from
geometric defects while facilitating spin-dependent, directional energy transport and strong field confinement.
The proposed top-down design approach considers a carefully configured finite material slab; illuminated by an acoustic
source; placed in a homogeneous background medium. It utilizes density based topology optimization [23] to solve the inverse
design problem starting from an initial guess provided by the user and is inspired by work on designing meta-material slabs
exhibiting negative refraction [24]. It is noted that while the topology optimization method and the topological insulator share
the word ”topology” the two uses are not directly related. In topology optimization the word refers to the ultimate spatial design
freedom that allows the algorithm to choose the structural topology which optimizes the objective function. It is noteworthy
that several recent works have demonstrated the benefit of using topology optimization in the design and optimization of exotic
meta-materials and crystals, such as multifunctional optical meta-gratings [25], elastic meta-materials with negative effective
material parameters [26] and self-collimating phononic crystals [27]. Further, two review papers [28, 29] for using inverse
design in photonics show numerous successful uses of topology optimization.
A sketch of the model domain serving as the design platform in this work, is shown in Fig. 1(c). Here ΩA denotes an air
region surrounded by a perfectly matched layer [30], denoted ΩPML . A hexagonally shaped design domain is placed inside

The slab is illuminated by a mono-polar point source, PS , placed in the focal point of a perfectly reflecting parabolic reflector
(n · ∇Ψ(r) = 0 ∀ r ∈ ΓR ).
The careful choice of the 180o rotationally symmetric configuration of ΩdR,1 and ΩdR,2 is key to the proposed approach.
This means that under ideal conditions any power flowing along the interface edge from P1 to P3 (see Fig. 1(d)), will be
indistinguishable from power flowing from P1 to the centre of the slab after which it reverses direction and flows back to P1.
Hence, by minimizing the power flow from P1 to P3 one by extension minimizes back-scattering.

case, Ψ = p where p(r) is the sound pressure and {C1 , C2 } = { ρ1 , κ1 } where ρ(r) and κ(r) are the density and bulk modulus,
respectively. Material parameters for air and aluminium are used [31]. The impedance contrast between the two ensuring that
vibrations exited in the solid are negligible, and thus (1) accurately captures the physics, as verified in [32, 33].
The design problem is formulated as a continuous constrained
S optimization problem and solved using density based topology
optimization. A spatial design field ξ(r) ∈ [0, 1] ∀ r ∈ ΩdR,1 ΩdR,2 is introduced to control the periodic material distributions
in ΩdR,1 and ΩdR,2 by interpolating C1 and C2 between the material parameters as,

Figure 1(b) shows the base design cells in which the material distribution is manipulated to solve the optimization problem.
The content of each base cell is duplicated throughout ΩdR,1 and ΩdR,2 to construct the material distribution (topological phases)
used when solving (1). For the example treated in this letters C3v-symmetry is imposed on both base cells. The designable
region is colored grey and the mirror symmetries are shown using dashed lines. An example of a design for one phase and its

where ΦTotal is the objective function consisting of a linear combination of the terms ΦMaxi , i ∈ {1, 2, 3} and ΦMin , all of which
are integrals of the field intensity magnitude over ΩMaxi , i ∈ {1, 2, 3} and ΩMin , while ΦBG denotes the integral of the field
intensity magnitude over ΩBG , see Fig. 1(d). The constants γj > 0, j ∈ {1, 2, 3} control the constraints (4)-(5) and Φ? is

Here I(Ψ(ξ)) denotes the field intensity and τ? a set of scaling constants. The choice of ΦTotal leads to a maximization of the
energy transmitted into ΩMax1 and ΩMax2 along with a simultaneous minimization of the energy transmitted into ΩMin . That is,
in order to maximize ΦTotal any field emitted by PS , propagating along the interface between ΩdR,1 and ΩdR,2 , must keep ΩdR,1
on its right hand side and ΩdR,2 on its left hand side at all times. This prohibits a change in propagation direction, which would
occur if the field propagated along the interface between ΩdR,1 and ΩdR,2 to ΩMin , as the spatial symmetry is inverted at the centre
of the material slab. This in turn promotes back-scattering protected transport of energy along the interface. The constraint (4)
ensures that a bulk-bandgap exists in both topological phases, as energy is prohibited from propagating into ΩBG . The constraint
(5) may be used to control the ratio of the intensity transmitted to ΦMax1 and ΦMax2 , respectively.
The design problem, (1)-(6), is implemented and solved in COMSOL Multiphysics 5.3 using the deterministic gradientbased optimization method, the globally convergent method of moving asymptotes (GCMMA) [34] to solve (3)-(5). The
objective function gradients are calculated efficiently using adjoint sensitivity analysis [28]. A physically admissible final design,
consisting solely of solid and air and free of numerical artefacts, is assured using the projection and filtering procedure outlined
in [24, 35, 36].

The initial ξ(r)-layout, shown in Fig. 2(a), is chosen to constitute a crystal with a bulk-bandgap at f0 [see the band structure in

4
Fig. 3(a)]. The final material layout obtained from the optimization process is shown in Fig. 2(b), with white/black representing
solid/air.
TheSmax-normalized pressure field at f0 = 20 kHz, along with the initial and optimized material configurations in
ΩdR,1 ΩdR,2 are shown in Figs. 2(c) and 2(d), respectively. The bulk-bandgap of the initial material configuration is clearly
observed. For the optimized TI design it is clear that the vast majority of the energy flowing into port 1 (P1) is transmitted to
either port 2 (P2) or port 4 (P4). Simultaneously a bulk-bandgap is observed for both phases of the TI. Figure 2(e) presents a
frequency sweep of the transmission to ports 2, 3 and 4, normalized to the power flowing through port 1: 10 log10 (|Px |/|P1 |). It
is seen that 99.5% of the acoustic power is transmitted from port 1 to ports 2 and 4 at f0 = 20 kHz. Further, it is seen that the
transmission does not drop below −0.85 dB from 18 kHz to 20.4 kHz.

The above discussion demonstrates that the top-down approach results in the desired macroscopic response. However, as no
explicit requirements on the existence of TI effects were included in the optimization formulation, the macroscopic response
could in principle be based on other effects. That a TI has indeed appeared spontaneously through the optimization process is
revealed in the following analysis.
Figure 3(b) shows the band structure diagram, calculated for the TI super cell shown in Fig. 3(c) using periodic boundary
conditions on the top and bottom edges and Neumann conditions on left and right edges. The bulk-band regions are colored grey
and the two ”crossing” symmetry inverted edge-state bands are colored red and blue corresponding to the positive and negative
pseudo spin-1/2 edge-state modes, shown for f0 = 20 kHz in Figs. 3(d) and 3(e), respectively. From Fig. 3(b) the bulk-bandgap
is seen to stretch from ≈18 kHz to ≈20.4 kHz, a bandgap of ≈12.5%. A narrow gap is seen in the two edge-state bands at the
k|| = 0 point. A similar gap was reported in [18] where it was explained to originate from the imperfect cladding layer rather
than the TI itself. Figure 3(f) presents the band structure for the first six bands of each of the two crystal phases constituting the
TI, revealing degeneracies for bands 2 and 3 and bands 4 and 5 at the Γ-point for both crystal phases.
To further investigate if a TI supporting geometrically robust backscattering protected transport of acoustic energy has been
designed, a series of studies on the effect of introducing defects in the TI are performed. Figure 4 presents four examples, with
Fig. 4(a) showing a slab of the TI without any defects as a reference, while Figs. 4(b)-4(d) show a bend, cavity and disorder
defect, respectively. The three defects all preserve the symmetry of the bulk materials and are shown in Fig. 1(a), where they are
highlighted using green. The slabs are excited by a point source positioned 0.3a from their left edge, at the interface of the two
topological phases. The power, transmitted through the TI, is computed at the right side of the slab for each configuration. The
results of these computations are reported in Fig. 4(e), max-normalized with respect to the non-defect TI.
Figure 4(e), reveals good agreement of the transmitted power inside the bulk-bandgap across the four cases. The largest
deviation between the non-defect and defect structures is 2.5 dB, and intervals showing less than 0.25 dB deviation are observed.
These results support that a TI offering backscattering protected propagation has been designed. The differences in transmission
seen in Fig. 4(e) are orders of magnitude smaller than the differences observed across the majority of the band of operation for
similar defects in a traditional phononic crystal wave-guide, with a worst case value of more than 25 dB reported in [18].

more than 99% of the total power is confined, Pf (d) > 0.99 for [Optim] the optimized TI design and [Ref] the reference. (c) TI super cell,

An important aspect to consider when designing systems for energy/information transport, such as wave-guides, is the
footprint of the system. In the present context, the footprint refers to how wide the material slab must be to confine a certain
fraction of the transported energy. From Fig. 4(a), the pressure field in the TI appears to be confined (to a 30 dB level) inside
approximately 3a from the TI interface edge. An investigation of the spatial confinement of the field is performed using the TI
from [18] as a reference. This is done by calculating the fraction of the total power flowing through the TI within a distance d
from the TI interface edge [see the illustration in Fig. 5(c)],

The results for f0 = 20 kHz are shown in Fig. 5(a). From here it is observed that more than 99% of the power is contained
within d ≈ 3a for the TI design proposed in this letter, while for the reference d ≈ 9a is required. A map showing the distance
d within which 99% or more of the power is confined versus frequency for both TIs is provided in Fig. 5(b). From this map it is
seen that at most a distance of 6a is required to contain 99% of the power for the proposed TI.
In summary, this letter reports on the design of a topological insulator using a top-down approach based on density based
topology optimization. The approach directly targets the desired effect of backscattering protected, directional energy transport.
That the effect is achieved by the resulting TI is demonstrated through numerical studies. Experimental validation of the approach
may be found in [33] where a meta-material exhibiting negative refraction is considered.
The proposed design approach is trivially extendible to photonics, assuming TE or TM polarized light. Further, by introducing
additional design constraints and goals it is straightforwardly extendable to e.g. consider global defects in the TI or to target a

6
maximization of the operational bandwidth in the design process. Hence, the approach has freedom to tailor TIs to operate under
alternative conditions.
