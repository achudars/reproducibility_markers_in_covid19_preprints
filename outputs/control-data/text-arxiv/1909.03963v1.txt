The phenomenon of quantum steering in bipartite quantum systems can be reduced to the question
whether or not the first party can perform measurements such that the conditional states on the
second party can be explained by a local hidden state model. Clearly, the answer to this depends
on the measurements which the first party is able to perform. We introduce a local hidden state
model explaining the conditional states for all generalized measurements on Bell-diagonal states
of two qubits. More precisely, it is known for the restricted case of projective measurements and
Bell-diagonal states characterised by the correlation matrix T that a local hidden state model exists
if and only if RT = 2πNT |det(T )| ≥ 1, where NT is defined by an integral over the Bloch sphere.
For generalized measurements described by positive operator valued measures we construct a model
if RT ≥ 6/5. Our work paves the way for a systematic study of steerability of quantum states with
generalized measurements beyond the highly-symmetric Werner states.

INTRODUCTION

Since its first description in 1935, the EinsteinPodolsky-Rosen (EPR) argument [1, 2] has been at the
center of many debates on the foundations of quantum
mechanics and, at the same time, also a welling source of
inspiration. Pondering on it, Bell introduced the concept
of nonlocality [3]; reconsidering the issue later, Werner
and Primas defined modern notions of classical correlations and entanglement [4–6]. Both the theory of Bell
nonlocality and of entanglement have played a crucial
role in the development of modern quantum information
theory. Based on ideas of Schrödinger, Wiseman and collaborators showed more recently that behind the EPR
argument is yet another concept of quantum nonlocality, called quantum steering [7, 8]. This discovery since
then has caused a new surge of research in quantum information theory. Characterization of quantum steering
has been studied, many connections to different areas of
quantum information were found and applications were
established, for a recent review see Ref. [9].
For explaining the notion of quantum steering, suppose
Alice and Bob share a bipartite quantum state ρ over
the finite-dimensional Hilbert space HA ⊗ HB and Alice
performs measurements on her side. The most general
measurement with n outcomes is described by a positive
operator valued measure (n-POVM). Such a measure E is
a collection of n positive operators,
E = {Ei }ni=1 , Ei ≥ 0,
Pn
fulfilling the normalization i=1 Ei = 11A , where 11A is
the identity operator on HA (similarly, 11B will denote
the identity operator acting on HB ).
After Alice performed the measurement and obtained
the result, Bob’s resulting states form the steering ensemble of conditional states, {TrA [ρ(Ei ⊗ 11B )]}ni=1 . If,
however, the entanglement between the two parties is not
sufficiently strong, the conditional states can be locally

simulated by a so-called local hidden state model [7]. The
strategy of simulating goes as follows. Alice, instead of
providing Bob with a part of the entangled state, simply
sends him an ensemble of states {σλ } indexed by some
variable λ distributed according to a distribution p(λ),
known as local hidden states (LHS).
To simulate the steering corresponding to measurement {Ei }ni=1 , Alice assigns state σλ to outcome i according to certain designed probability Gi (λ). The funcn
tions
Pn G = {Gi }i=1 , thus satisfying Gi (λ) ≥ 0 and
i=1 Gi (λ) = 1 for each λ, are referred to as response
functions. In this way Alice can simulate the steering
ensemble by averaging over states associated to each outcome,
X
TrA [ρ(Ei ⊗ 11B )] =
Gi (λ)p(λ)σλ .
(1)
λ

Here the summation can be reformulated as an integration over an appropriate measure if required. Eq. (1) ensures that Bob, when performing state tomography conditioned on Alice’s outcomes, obtains the same result as
if Alice were steering his system by means of measurement E [7]. If the design of the LHS ensemble {σλ } is
such that for all measurements E Alice can find a response function G such that Eq. (1) holds, we say that
the state is unsteerable; otherwise it is steerable.
This definition also extends naturally to the case where
Alice is limited to certain subsets of measurements. Most
often she is limited to performing projective measurements (or projector values measures, PVMs) only. In this
case, for certain important entangled states LHS models
exist, proving the states to be unsteerable [7]. Some of
these models can also be shown to be optimal, leading to
an exact characterization of steering in these cases. These
include the Werner states [6, 7], the isotropic states [7]
or general two-qubit states [10], where the solution for
Bell-diagonal states is particularly simple [11–13]. If
the most general measurements in quantum mechanics
are taken into account, namely those described by general POVMs, the construction of LHS models is difficult.
The most important known model is arguably the Bar-

2
rett model, which was constructed for Werner states and
isotropic states [14]. Contrary to the models for projective measurements, Barrett’s model has never been
demonstrated to be optimal; in fact evidence indicates
that it is not [10, 15]. Barrett’s model also appeared to
be ad hoc, seemingly limited to only Werner states and
isotropic states, which are highly symmetric.
In this work, we generalize the Barrett construction
of an LHS model to a more general family of two-qubit
states, those which can be considered as a mixture of Bell
states, or Bell-diagonal states. Quantum steering of Belldiagonal states when measurements are limited to projective measurements has been recently understood [11–13].
With our new LHS model for POVMs we can prove the
unsteerability of a significant set of Bell-diagonal states.
Our model is one of the first LHS models for POVMs on
two-qubit states beyond the highly symmetric cases. In
fact there is, to our knowledge, only one other LHS model
for POVMs, which is based on LHS models for projective measurements [16]. The model is, however, more
limited and paradoxically appears to be more effective
only for high-dimensional system rather than for twoqubit states. In our work we also explicitly demonstrate
that our construction is still non-optimal, as it fails to
detect the unsteerability of some separable Bell-diagonal
states.
In the following, we start with introducing the Bloch
four-vector representation of operators acting on qubit
systems. After recalling the known results on quantum
steering of Bell-diagonal states, we will describe the construction of our LHS model for POVMs.

II.

BLOCH REPRESENTATION AND
BELL-DIAGONAL STATES

For a qubit, any operator X can be conveniently presented by a four-vector, xx0 , referred to as the Bloch
representation. This is defined according to the expansion
3

1X
X=
xi σi ,
2 i=0

where T is s (3 × 3) matrix representing the correlation
between them. Without loss of generality, we can assume
that T is diagonal. The reason is that the steering properties of a quantum state are invariant under local unitary
transformations acting on the states. These transformations act as orthogonal transformations on the matrix T ,
and due to the singular value decomposition this can be
used to diagonalize T [17].

III.

STEERING WITH PROJECTIVE
MEASUREMENTS

To explain our construction, we first recall the optimal LHS model for Bell-diagonal states if measurements
are limited to projective ones [11–13]. A projective measurement on Alice’s side corresponds to a pairof effects,
which can be represented by Bloch vectors e11 and e12
with two unit vectors e 2 = −ee1 . As Alice gets outcomes
i ∈ {1, 2}, a direct calculation shows that Bob’s conditional states are

where σk for k = 0, 1, 2, 3 are the Pauli matrices extended
to also include the identity matrix. In particular,
projec
tions or pure states are represented by n1 , with n being
an unit vector. The set of pure states is thus a sphere,
known as the Bloch sphere. Similarly, a two-qubit state
ρ can be most conveniently characterized by its Bloch
tensor,

The states that are diagonal in the Bell basis are those
for which Alice’s and Bob’s reduced states are maximally

where the integral is taken over the surface of the Bloch
sphere with dS being the surface measure. The response
function for projective measurements is chosen as [11]

Comparing this with the conditional states due to the
actual measurements at Alice’s side in Eq. (5), one sees
that RT ≥ 1 suffices to deduce that the corresponding
Bell-diagonal state is unsteerable [11, 18]: If RT = 1 the
LHS model simulates exactly the state, while for RT >
1 the LHS model allows even to simulate a state with
stronger correlations.
The described construction of the LHS ensemble was
later proven to be optimal [12, 13], thus this is also a
necessary condition for the Bell-diagonal state to be unsteerable. In fact, the quantity RT has been generalized
for general states, where it is referred to as the critical
radius of the state [15].
IV.

STEERING WITH POSITIVE OPERATOR
VALUED MEASURES

We now consider the case where Alice makes a POVM.
It is known that in studying steerability of qubits, it is
sufficient to consider POVMs consisting of four rank-1
effects, as these are the extremal POVMs [14, 19]. A
range-1 POVM of 4 outcomes is given by effects αi e1i

Our purpose is to construct a possible LHS model to
model these conditional ensembles of states. The probability distribution of the LHS ensemble is still defined by

response function.
Let us digress for a moment to comment on the rationale behind the construction in Eq. (13) and Eq. (16).
We first notice that the conditional state in Eq. (12) for
POVMs is very similar to that for PVMs in Eq. (5). The
only difference is the prefactor αi in Eq. (12). One thus
might attempt to modify the response function for projective measurements in Eq. (8) by a multiplicative factor αi . Unfortunately, since a POVM has four effects
this does not result in a valid response function, in contrast to projective measurements, since the summation
of the response functions over the outcomes exceeds one.
The strategy is to soften the response function in Eq. (8)
first to the form in Eq. (13) by multiplication with a linear function. The linear softener in Eq. (13) was chosen
to guarantee the subnormalization for all measurements
in Eq. (18). The subnormalization is then corrected by
an additive factor in Eq. (16) such that normalization is
guaranteed and we obtain a valid response function.
Having shown that the response functions in Eq. (16)
are valid, it remains to demonstrate that the simulated
states match the steered states as required by the definition of unsteerability in Eq. (1). We will now show that
the conditional state Alice can simulate is given by

with RT defined by Eq. (10). In a similar manner with
the elaboration of Eq. (9), we can deduce that a Belldiagonal state is unsteerable with POVMs if RT ≥ 6/5.

FIG. 1. Separability, steerability with PVMs and POVMs of
Bell-diagonal states. A general Bell-diagonal state is, up to
local unitary transformations described by three parameters
(s1 , s2 , s3 ), which, without loosing generality, can be assumed
to be positive. The states with all si equal correspond to the
Werner states. Using the original Barrett construction and
the fact that separable states have an LHS model, one can
see that the states in the volume characterized by the greenviolet surface have an LHS model. The surface of states for
which our model works (RT = 6/5) is shown as a yellowgreen grid. The border of unsteerable states with projective
measurements (RT = 1) is shown as a diaphanous surface.
See the text for discussion.

Werner states

For two qubits, the Werner states are given by
Wp = p|ψ− ihψ− | + (1 − p)

(38)

√
where |ψ− i = (|01i − |10i)/ 2 and 0 ≤ p ≤ 1. The
Werner states are certainly a special Bell-diagonal state,
with the critical radius RWp = 1/(2p) [15].The condition
RWp ≥ 1 for it to be unsteerable with PVMs reduces
to p ≤ 1/2, and the condition RWp ≥ 1 for it to be
unsteerable with POVMs reduces to p ≤ 5/12, both of
which are well-known [6, 7, 14].

B.

Axially symmetric Bell-diagonal states

For the case of Bell-diagonal states with axial symmetry, T = diag(−s, −s, −t), the critical radius RT can be

General Bell-diagonal states

Let us finally discuss general Bell-diagonal states with
T = − diag(s1 , s2 , s3 ). In the space of (s1 , s2 , s3 ), the separable Bell diagonal states constitute an octahedron [17],
which is symmetric under the three reflections si → −si .
Moreover RT depends only on the absolute values of si .
We thus can concentrate on the steerability and separability of the Bell-diagonal states in the positive octant
s1 ≥ 0, s2 ≥ 0, s2 ≥ 0.
This situation is depicted in Fig. 1. In the positive
octant, the border separating separable states from entangled state is a triangle with vertices (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0),
(0, 0, 1). Note that separable states are certainly unsteerable with POVMs. The original Barrett model for
Werner states shows that the state corresponding to
(5/12, 5/12, 5/12) is also unsteerable with POVMs. Taking the convex hull of this point (5/12, 5/12, 5/12) with
those of the separable states, we obtain a polytope of
states which are definitely unsteerable with POVMs. The
faces of this polytopes are presented in Fig. 1 together
with the surface RT = 6/5. The figure illustrates that
our model demonstrates a significant new volume of Belldiagonal states to be unsteerable with POVMs, in comparison to what has been known in the literature.
It should be noted, however, that our model does not
work for all the states in the polytope mentioned above.
In fact, the introduced model does not demonstrate the
unsteerability of certain separable states, indicating that
it is not optimal. Extrapolating to the Barrett’s original
construction, one can expect that this well-known model
is also not optimal. This is compatible with the conjecture that POVMs and PVMs are equivalent in quantum
steering with the two-qubit Werner states, which is supported by some numerical evidence [10, 15, 20].
VI.

CONCLUSION

At first sight, Barrett’s construction of an LHS model
for Werner states [14] appears to be ad hoc. Our generalization illustrates a certain rational reasoning behind
the construction. However, the very fact that Eq. (20)
holds only came out though a rather complicated computation. The question whether this identity is a math-

6
ematical coincidence or there is a deeper mathematical
reason underpinned it is an interesting question. We expect that the answer to this question can possibly lead
to LHS models for a much more general class of bipartite
states, shedding light on the role of POVMs in quantum

steering and quantum nonlocality.
