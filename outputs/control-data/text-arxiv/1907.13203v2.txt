We develop a real space renormalization group (RSRG) scheme by appropriately inserting the
long range hopping t ∼ r−α with nearest neighbour interaction to study the entanglement entropy
and maximum block size for many-body localization (MBL) transition. We show that for α < 2
there exists a localization transition with renormalized disorder that depends logarithmically on the
finite size of the system. The transition observed for α > 2 does not need a rescaling in disorder
strength. Most importantly, we find that even though the MBL transition for α > 2 falls in the same
universality class as that of the short-range models, while transition for α < 2 belongs to a different
universality class. Due to the intrinsic nature of the RSRG flow towards delocalization, MBL phase
for α > 2 might suffer an instability in the thermodynamic limit while the underlying systems
support algebraic localization. Moreover, we verify these findings by inserting microscopic details
to the RSRG scheme where we additionally find a more appropriate rescaling function for disorder
strength; we indeed uncover a power law scaling with a logarithmic correction and a distinctly
different stretched exponential scaling for α < 2 and α > 2, respectively, by analyzing system with
finite size. This finding further suggests that microscopic RSRG scheme is able to give a hint of
instability of the MBL phase for α > 2 even considering systems of finite size.

INTRODUCTION

Localization-delocalization transition occurring in
quantum system separates the non-ergodic, reversible
phase from the ergodic, irreversible phase of matter1,2 .
The concept of Anderson localization, observed in single particle picture3 , can be elevated to many-body
localization (MBL) in the interacting system even in
finite temperature4,5 . The intensive investigation of
the above phenomenon unfolds many unusual response
properties6,7 , new nature of quantum entanglement8–10 ,
and non-trivial phases of matter absent in equilibrium11 .
For example, MBL phase violates eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH)12–16 , is characterized by an
area law of entanglement entropy (EE) and localization
length, while delocalized ergodic phase satisfies volume
law for both of them17,18 . On the other hand, in the context of time periodic Floquet system, MBL phase can
help in exploring the Floquet time crystal19,20 . Cold
atomic systems happen to be a good test bed for investigating the MBL transition21,22 . The experimental
search has already began in this field of research to check
the theoretical predictions23,24 . However, it is important to point out that even though analytic perturbative
arguments support the existence of MBL25,26 , very recently the stability of this phase has been questioned in
interacting systems with correlated27 and un-correlated
disorder28 .
It is natural question to ask that whether MBL transition persists for long range hopping: t ∼ r−α as Anderson
showed that single particle localization can not occur in
the presence of long range hopping for α ≤ d where d
is the dimension of the system. Most of the numerical
attempts in one dimensional system show that MBL can
not survive for α < 2 while MBL occurs for α > 229–32 .
Interestingly, perturbative treatment on an effective An-

derson model can show MBL transition even for α < 133 .
Recently, it has been found that a different kind of localization namely, algebraic localization, takes place due to
the presence of long-range hopping34,35 , which gives rise
to some interesting unique phenomena such as anomalous transport36,37 and a sub-extensive scaling of EE38 .
Moreover, in the context of quantum spin chain the long
range interaction is also investigated in detail leading to a
plethora of non-trivial results39–41 . These upsurge of theoretical studies in long range model are highly motivated
by a series of earlier experimental investigations42–48 .
In the context of MBL transition, a promising alternative to the existing exact diagonalization(ED) technique is real space renormalization group (RSRG)
description49–54 . The main advantage of using the RSRG
technique is that it can overcome the system size limitation. Within this approach, we solve a macroscopic
version of the underlying model instead of solving the
actual interacting microscopic model where the Hilbert
space dimension grows exponentially with system size.
The common principle employed in all the RG schemes
is that the collective resonant tunneling processes are energetically favored in the delocalized phase while localized phase supports the formation isolated islands caused
by the suppression of resonant tunneling. Moreover,
there has been a recent proposal to incorporate the microscopic details in the RSRG scheme to study models
with quasi-periodic potential55 . Till now all ED results
suggests the violation of Harris-Chayes-Chayes-FisherSpencer criterion56,57 , which claims the diverging localization length exponent ν ≥ 2/d. Interestingly, ν obtained from RSRG studies satisfies the above criteria.
Much having explored in the field of RSRG technique
with the short range hopping model, our focus here is to
extend the RSRG analysis to the interacting long range
system with hopping as t ∼ r−α . The questions that

2
we would like to answer are how one can identify and
characterize the MBL transition in long range hopping
system with α in presence of nearest neighbor interaction. Overcoming the system size barrier that one encounters in ED, RSRG formalism can decisively convey
that the renormalization of disorder strength is essential to observe the true MBL transition in the thermodynamic limit for this kind of system with α < 2. On the
contrary, MBL transition for α > 2 requires no renormalization of disorder strength. Most interestingly, our
analysis with correlation length exponent ν suggests that
the universality class of the MBL transition occurring for
α < 2 is different than the usual Anderson type which
we observe for α > 2. We then strengthen our findings
by incorporating the microscopic details in the RSRG
scheme where we additionally find a more appropriate
renormalization of disorder strength. We here find that
our numerically obtained scaling functions for the disorder strength are mostly in congruence with analytical
studies considering long range nature of hopping as well
as interaction29,58 . The microscopic RSRG scheme allows
us to get a hint about the instability of the MBL phase
for α > 2 even with the finite size of the system where
macroscopic RSRG predicts a MBL transition. It would
be an interesting question to study the stability of MBL
transition for α > 2 in algebraic localization considering
large system size.
We shall now discuss about the organization of the paper. We first introduce the RSRG algorithm for the long
range system in Sec. II. We also present the prescription
for the calculation of EE and MBS. We then elaborate
on our findings in Sec. III. We here analyze the behavior of EE and MBS to characterize the MBL transition
occurring in finite size system. Next, we briefly discuss
the microscopic input to this RSRG scheme and investigate its consequences. We compare microscopic and
macroscopic RSRG findings by analyzing the histogram
of largest blocks in Sec. IV. Lastly, in Sec. V, we conclude.

RG SCHEME

We now describe in details the implementation of the
RSRG approach, which we employ here to study the longrange models. The main idea is to investigate the structure of resonance clusters, caused by the destabilization
of MBL phase, using appropriate RG rules for our systems. Finding all such generic many-body resonances for
a microscopic models is a challenging problem both analytically and also even numerically. Numerical studies
suffer from severe system size limitations, because of the
exponential growth of Hilbert space dimension with system size L. Hence, instead of solving the full resonance
structure for any such microscopic Hamiltonian, we first
identify small resonant clusters starting from two-sites
resonance pairs. We then examine whether groups of
these small resonant clusters can collectively resonate or
not. We apply these techniques iteratively to identify the

the structure of resonance clusters in the large scale. The
RG rules with technical detail, which is very similar to
the one proposed by Dumitrescu et al.54 , are described
below. We at the same time note that RSRG approach
can be regarded as a certain toy model for MBL transition, whether or not the RSRG rules provide a correct
description of MBL transition is still a subject of debate.
The ED provides a full grasp into complex nature of disordered interacting systems which might not be fully captured by RSRG schemes.
We note that the RSRG approach is not limited to a
certain type of lattice model. However, one can think a
corresponding microscopic model

where ĉ†i (ĉi ) is the fermionic creation (annihilation) operator at site i, n̂i = ĉ†i ĉi is the number operator. µi
is the chemical potential uniformly distributed on the
interval [0, W ]. V  (Jij , W ) is the strength of nearest neighbour interaction. Jij is considered to be the
long-range hopping between i and j-th site leading to
the algebraically localized SPSs. L is the size of the
system. It is noteworthy that once Jij = Ji,i+1 = J,
being restricted to the nearest neighbour only, the i-th
SPS is exponentially localized near site i with energy
i ' µi + O(J 2 /W ). In the case of nearest-neighbour
interaction only, the diagonal energy mismatch is simply
given by ∆Eij = |i − j | ∼ |µi − µj |. Then the idea
of the RSRG scheme is to consider the nearest neighbor interaction V as a perturbation and express the tunneling in terms of SPSs which are exponentially localized in the above case. Hence, the tunneling amplitude
is having the form Γij = V exp(−|i − j|/x0 ) with x0
be the localization length50 . We would like to mention
that for the long-range interacting case29 with Vij n̂i n̂j ,
the energy mismatch
P between two sites i and j becomes
∆Eij ∼ |µi − µj + k6=i,j (Vik − Vjk )n̂k |. In general, the
role of interactions is to set in the multi-particle collective
resonances. For weak interactions, the system remains in
MBL phase and the local integrals of motion associated
with the weakly dressed single-particle orbitals become
few-body local integrals of motion25 . For strong enough
interactions, MBL phase breaks down as the clusters become resonantly linked.
Given these details, we shall now implement the RSRG
scheme with long-range hopping Jij while the interaction
V is considered to be nearest neighbour. At the outset,
we discuss the main philosophy behind our RSRG scheme
that we adopt. For very strong disorder, the resonantly
linked pairs are well separated and their density is very
small. As the disorder weakened, these resonant links
are more frequently formed eventually leading towards
the disruption of localization. One can note that the
process of making the collective resonant links has to be
energetically favored. These could lead to an avalanche

3
mechanism where the system continues to stuck and the
size of the resonant cluster grows58,59 . Therefore, the
delocalization stems from the these avalanches. Below
we shall discuss it with technical detail.
First, we consider a chain of L sites and assign each
sites with some random number λi = [0, W ] identified
as on-site energy. Next, we need to initialize the tunneling matrix elements Γij , which represent the typical
tunneling amplitude between i and j sites. As the singleparticle wave-function of long-range models are found
to be algebraically localized instead of exponential, we
choose Γij = V /|i − j|α , being our initial values. Here
V can be thought of the nearest neighbor interaction
strength; we set V = 0.5 for all our calculations. Then,
we start our RG procedure by comparing the tunneling
matrix elements Γij between sites i and j with the energy mismatch ∆Eij = |λi − λj |. If Γij > ∆Eij , we
merge those sites to build a cluster. We continue this
process iteratively.

formed clusters and ni0 is the number of sites in cluster
i0 . There is an exception if λi0 ≥ δi0 ≥ λj 0 ≥ δj 0 , we then
consider ∆Ei0 j 0 = min(δi0 − λj 0 , δj 0 ). The renormalization rules of Γ during the iterative process are chosen in
the following way. If two clusters are not modified during
a RG step, the coupling between them is set to zero and
if at least one of the two clusters is modified during the
RG step, Γ is given by,

(short range) corresponds to α < 2 (α > 2). However,
we note that the convergence of our RSRG scheme is
much slower compared to the RSRG scheme used previously for systems with exponentially localized SPSs50 .
Hence, our numerical calculations are limited within the
system size L ∼ O(103 ).
As passing remarks, we would like to mention that the
rules of the RSRG scheme imply a thermal cluster of size
lT can thermalize spins which are located at distance
RAL < C 2lT /a fom the core of the inclusion where C is
a constant. The distance RAL grows exponentially with
the size lT of the thermal inclusion and the probability
of thermalizing the whole system by such a thermal inclusion quickly reaches 1 with increasing lT . This means
that the strong disorder phase is, in fact, not stable to inclusion of a sufficiently large thermal region when the size
of the system is thermodynamically large L → ∞. The
uncorrelated nature of the disorder and algebraic structure of single particle states might be responsible for the
above instability. At large W , the probability of occurrence of a thermal cluster of size lT is very small and the
strong disorder phase appears to be localized. However,
the probability grows with system size L eventually leading to thermalization at any W . On the other hand, we
would like to emphasize the difference in the RSRG for
short-range systems where a thermal inclusion of size lT
thermalizes only spins residing within a fixed region REL
that is related to the localization length of the system.
Hence this size of REL would not grow with the system
size L → ∞.

where sth = ln 2 is the characteristic entropy per site
in the thermal phase. This form is believed to be hold
for matrix element of local operators that obey ETH54 .
The RG iterative process terminates when no new resonant bond emerges, i.e. the cluster structure receives no
modifications by further RG steps.
In this paper, we investigate two quantities. 1) Bipartite EE, obtained by dividing the system into two equal
half. After the end of a RG procedure for a given initial disorder
realization, the EE is technically defined as
P
S =
min(m,
n). The sum is over all the clusters
C
which span the interval boundary and m , n are number
of sites which are separated by the partition of the systems for such clusters. 2) Localization length ξ, which
is defined by the maximum block size (MBS) found at
the end of a RG procedure for a particular initial disorder realization. We run our RG procedure for 105 − 106
times for different random realization to obtain average
value of EE and MBS.54 . This technique allows us to
simulate system size up to L ' 500 in contrast to the ED
technique, which is practically impossible to implement
for any size L > 20. We analyze the above quantities
by varying the tunneling exponent α as defined in the
RG nomenclature. However, considering the underlying
physics behind α, one can understand that long range

RESULTS

We here shall describe the behavior of EE and MBS
obtained using RSRG scheme described previously. We
systemically study the critical behavior associated with
the transition in Sec. III A and Sec. III B.

A.

Macroscopic RSRG

Our aim is to probe the transition with disorder
strength W by looking at the behavior of EE density
S/L for different values of L. In fig. 1 (a) with α = 1.2,
we show S/L starts from unity for small W and gradually
it falls with increasing W . S/L → 1(0), refers to the fact
that the system is in a delocalized (localized) phase. We
see that in the small W region, S/L falls more rapidly
for smaller L than larger L while in the large W region,
S/L saturates more quickly for smaller L. As a result, we
see many intersections of S/L between different lengths.
A careful analysis suggests that with increasing L, the
intersection between two consecutive L shifts towards a
higher value of W ; we refer W = Wi where intersection
occurs. One can demarcate the zone between maximum
and minimum value of Wi as ∆W ; this is depicted by
orange dashed line.

FIG. 1. (Color online) Plot shows the variation of entanglement entropy (EE) density S/L as a function of disorder
strength W for three tunneling exponents α = 1.2 in (a),
α = 1.5 in (b) and α = 1.8 in (c) with L = 100, 200, 300 and
500. The intersection point between two consecutive L shifts
towards a higher values of W as one increases W . The orange dashed line represents the disorder window ∆W within
which all the intersection are taking place. One can notice
with increasing α, ∆W shrinks.

Another noticeable observation is that for W 
max{Wi }, S/L does not saturate to a constant value
rather their saturation value increases with decreasing
L. This phase is then no longer a delocalized phase.
For finite size of the system, one can say that there is a
delocalization-localization transition if one varies W from
W  min{Wi } to W  max{Wi }. Therefore, the existence of Wi refers towards a transition but the transition
points becomes system size dependent. We repeat this
investigation for α = 1.5 (see ig. 1 (b)) and α = 1.8 (see
ig. 1 (b)) keeping α < 2. We observe qualitatively similar feature of the transition but the width of ∆W shrinks
and Wi ’s shifts towards lower values.
We here discuss the uniqueness of this observation.
This is in sharp contrast to the short range lattice models that support exponentially localized single particle
states (SPSs)51,60 . For the above kind of model, one can
observe a prominent transition point (designated by Wc )
that does not change with L referring to the fact that the
localization-delocalization transition is sharply defined in
the finite size system. It is obviously stable in the thermodynamic limit. On the contrary, what we observe here
in long range finite size system for α < 2 can better be
referred as a crossover. We note that the analogous microscopic long range Hamiltonian supports algebraically
localized SPSs34 . Precisely, the intersection point Wi is
size dependent hence, a conventional transition signature
between two phases can not be assigned for finite L. The
true existence of the localization-delocalization transition
in thermodynamic limit L → ∞ is therefore a subject of

FIG. 2. (Color online) The plot depicts the variation of EE S
as a function of W for α = 1.2 in (a) and α = 2.5 in (b). (a):
One can observe that the system residing in delocalized phase
(S ∼ L) meets a transition at W ' 20 above which volume
law of EE is no longer satisfied. Inset exhibits a zoomed in
figure for 18 < W < 25 where saturation characteristics of S
still shows L dependence. (b): It shows a clear transition from
delocalized to localized phase above W > Wc = 3.95 where
EE satisfies a clear area law. The inset shows the variation
of S/L with W where Wc is identified by the dashed orange
line.

investigation which we shall present below.
Having discussed the situation with α < 2, we shall
now focus on α > 2 sector. In this case, the system is
expected to show similar behavior as compared to the
short range models31 . We compare the behavior of S between α = 1.2 (see Fig. 2(a)) and α = 2.5 (see Fig. 2(b)).
For α = 1.2 case, S for different L does not show any
coincidence for larger values of W ; although, EE shows a
tendency towards saturation where saturation value increases with increasing L (see the inset for Fig. 2(a) where
a zoomed version of S is plotted for 18 < W < 25). A
clear distinction is seen in α = 2.5 where S for all L
coincides with each other for W > Wc . Once again We
emphasize that for α = 2.5, the inset of Fig. 2(b) depicts
a sharp transition point Wc for all values of L similar to
one observes for short-range models. While comparing
with Fig. 1(a), it is clear that crossover occurs as Wi
becomes a function of L.
One can hence infer that the nature of the phase transition even in finite size system changes from α < 2 to
α > 2 as far as the saturation characteristics of S is concerned. The nature of phase transition for α > 2 refers
to the fact that EE obeys area law for W > Wc . On
the other hand, for α < 2, EE apparently follows a subextensive scaling violating the area law38 ; this is a very
unconventional outcome for a localized phase. Therefore,
the natural question comes whether this saturation behavior is an artifact of the crossover.

We are now in a position to investigate the crossover
phenomena. Instead of considering the bare W , we can
continue our analysis with the renormalized W namely,
W ∗ according to the numerically predicted scaling

L

FIG. 3. (Color online) (a): We show the scaling of intersection
points Wi (solid back, red and green points), obtained from
crossing between different L, with L (in log scale) for α =
1, 2, 1.5 and 1.8. The dashed best fit straight lines show that
Wi ∼ γ ln L where γ depends on α. The brown solid lines
represent the Lη ln L fitting of Wi where we find η  (2 − α);
η = 0.11, 0.08, 0.05 for α = 1.2, 1.5, 1.8. (b): We show the
scaling of EE density, depicted by solid black, green and blue
points, with L (in log scale) with W = 20 for α = 1, 2, 1.3
and 1.4. The dashed violet straight lines confirms the area
law in the localized phase with W ∗ = 3.0.

Having compared S between α < 2 and α > 2, we turn
our focus to investigate about the intersection point more
extensively. One can notice that S/L for a given L intersects with all the other L (denoted by L0 ) in many different positions as denoted by Wi (L, L0 ). The prescription
that we are following is Wi (L, L0 ) → Wi ((L + L0 )/2) =
Wi (L); as a result, we get a large set of data points which
helps in describing the feature of Wi with L more precisely. We have also checked the robustness of our results
by adopting different methods for
√identifying Wi e.g., geometric mean Wi (L, L0 ) → Wi ( LL0 ) = Wi (L). These
different scheme lead to the same scaling function of Wi
as reported below. One can, on the other hand, choose
Wi (L, L + 100) → Wi (L + 50) = Wi (L) as in our analysis
we have L = 100, 200, 300, 400, 500. Figure 3(a) clearly
suggests the intersecting points Wi logarithmically scales
with L: Wi ∼ γ ln L for α < 2. However, the prefactor γ
depends on α. However, we also examine the Lη ln L scaling of Wi ; the best fit value of η appears to be dependent
on α, but η  (2 − α). Note that η = 2 − α has been predicted earlier in long-range interacting models29,58 . As
far as the merit of the scaling is concerned, we check that
our results remain unaltered within numerical accuracy
considering both of the scaling function. Furthermore,
unless L is chosen to be thermodynamically large, one
really can not distinguish between these two scaling function. The power law scaling Lη might prevail for large
L. Both of these scaling apparently prohibits the transition to happen in the thermodynamic limit: L → ∞,
Wi → ∞. On the other hand, γ approaches zero as one
approaches α = 2; this conveys the fact that there exists a sharp transition point Wc which is independent of
L. Hence, the transition obtained for α > 2 is stable at
least in finite system of size L ∼ O(102 ). In the thermodynamic limit L → ∞, the stability of MBL phase might
be obstructed as the length of the influence region RAL
grows with the length of the thermal block lT (see Sec. II,
for detail discussion).

The motivation behind this renormalization is to identify the proper transition point Wc∗ for a thermodynamic
system. Figure 4(a) depicts the variation of S/L as a
function of rescaled disorder W ∗ with α = 1.2. There
one can clearly notice the existence of a critical point
Wc∗ separating the delocalized phase from the localized
phase. We shall extensively describe below this observation with plausible argument.
We now probe the saturation scaling of EE with L for
a large but fixed value of W and W ∗ simultaneously. Figure 3(b) apparently suggests that for α < 2, S/L scales
as L−η with η ' 0.9 in the large W > max{Wi } limit
as depicted by the solid point symbols. Even though,
this observation is in congruence with the non-interacting
case of the microscopic model38 , the scaling exponent
however remains almost independent of the choice of α
unlike the non-interacting case. This might be due to
the mixing of the Hilbert space degrees of freedom for
an interacting system. Moreover, adiabatic continuity
demands that in the weakly interacting case, EE should
also obey the sub-extensive law in the localized phase.
Our macroscopic RG scheme might not be sufficient for
studying this law which is deeply governed by the microscopic nature of the model. However, this outcome goes
against the usual notion of localized phase in the context
of MBL transition. We hence scrutinize our observation
by considering the proper renormalized W ∗  Wc∗ . This
restricts us to stay well inside the localized phase rather
than in the vicinity of the crossover region. We there observe an absolute area law of EE in the finite size system
that is depicted by violet dashed line in Fig. 3(b). Therefore, irrespective of the microscopic nature the renormalization of W again becomes relevant to observe the accurate behavior associated with a MBL phase (we discuss
this at length in Sec. III B). We would like to emphasize
that the deviation from the area law for α < 2 is not an
artifact of the RSRG scheme with nearest neighbour interaction. It rather might be intrinsically caused by the
algebraic nature of the SPSs38 . As discussing the area
law of MBL phase, it is also important to highlight a major difference between the mechanisms of thermalization
for long-range models in comparison to the short-range
models. In short range systems, a thermal inclusion thermalizes only spins in a fixed range depending on the localization length. Contrastingly, for long-range systems a
such thermal inclusion will thermalize the whole systems.
It means that delocalization is much more favorable for
long-range models.
Turning to the Fig. 4(a), the visual inspection shows
that the rescaling of disorder strength leads to an approximate coincidence of all rescaled curve up to a certain

6
point Wc∗ = 0.99; W ∗ > Wc∗ , the coincidence is lost and
they start deviating from each other and S/L saturates to
a higher value as L increases. Therefore, one can obtain
a sharp transition point Wc∗ = 0.99. Having obtained
Wc∗ , one can check the finite size exponent ν, following the data collapse technique near the transition point
for α = 1.2. Our focus would be obtain a proper collapse in the right side of Wc∗ i.e., W ∗ > Wc∗ as the region
W ∗ < Wc∗ is less of our interest. The functional form that
we keep in our mind is S/L = f ((W ∗ − Wc∗ )L1/ν ) near
the transition point. We show in the inset of Fig. 4(a)
that (W − Wc∗ )L1/ν plots of S/L for different L coincide
(maximally for W ∗ ≥ Wc∗ ) with each other near 0 with
ν = 2.5 ± 0.31. To show the robustness of this exponent,
we consider different interaction strength V and α < 2.
We find remarkably that critical exponent obtained for
various settings are well inside the error bar.
On the other hand, we perform a data collapse for
α = 2.5 in Fig. 4(b) keeping the same mathematical
form in our mind near the transition point: S/L =
f ((W − Wc )L1/ν ). We note here that the renormalization of W is no longer required as the a sharp transition
point is obtained from bare W unlike the case for α = 1.2.
Moreover, the localized phase obey area law for W  Wc .
The interesting observation is that with ν = 3.1 ± 0.25,
one can obtain a very nice data collapse around W = Wc
in both the sides.
Extraction of these exponents conveys a lot of physical message about the transition for α < 2 and α > 2.
The transition observed for α = 2.5 is qualitatively different from the one observed for α = 1.2 as far as the
critical exponents are concerned. However, the localized
phases obtained for both sides of α = 2 bear the signature of area law. The nature of data collapse we observe
in Fig. 4(a) with α = 1.2 allows us to convey the message that there might be two different critical exponents
present in left and right side of Wc∗ 31 . By invoking the
concept of correlation length ε in the Hilbert space of the
problem near the transition point, we can write down the
following scaling relation
ε(W ∗) ∼ (W ∗ − Wc∗ )−ν1 ,
ε(W ∗) ∼ (Wc∗ − W ∗ )−ν2 ,

for W ∗ > Wc∗ ,
for W ∗ < Wc∗ .

(3)

Here we consider ν1,2 being the correlation length exponent, when Wc∗ is approached from above i.e., localized
(below i.e., delocalized) phase. This is clearly not the
case for α > 2 as shown in Fig. 4(b) where a single exponent ν = 3.1 can decisively collapse all S/L curves for
different L.
The existence of two different ν in two sides of transition point might be related to the absence of proper
length scale namely, localization length inside the system. Additionally, near the critical point in disordered
system, there exists Griffiths phase61 ; this idea is also
extensively explored in the context of MBL transition49 .
One also needs to consider the effect of Griffiths phase in
describing these exponents. However, what we would like
to emphasize more is that for α < 2, system essentially

FIG. 4. (Color online) We here show the finite size scaling
analysis for α = 1.2 in (a) and α = 2.5 in (b). (a): In order to identify a sharp transition point, we plot S/L as a
function of rescaled disorder W ∗ = W/ ln L. The coincidence
of S/L for different L is observed W ∗ < Wc∗ = 0.99 after
which S/L tends to deviate from each other and eventually
saturates for W ∗  Wc∗ ; this saturation value increases as L
decreases. Inset shows a clear data collapse around 0 (maximally for W ∗ > Wc∗ ) when S/L is plotted as a function of
(W ∗ − Wc∗ )L1/ν with ν = 2.5. (b): We repeat the inset of
(a) in (b) for α = 2.5 considering the fact that Wc = 3.95.
We find a perfect data collapse around 0 when S/L is plotted
as a function of (W − Wc )L1/ν with ν = 3.1. These clearly
suggests that the characteristics of transitions undergoing for
for α < 2 and α > 2 are qualitatively different.

being long range (we reiterate that SPSs of a microscopic
long range Hamiltonian are algebraically localized)34 , the
critical behavior associated with the MBL transition suggests that it belongs to a different universality class as
compared to the MBL transition occurring for α > 2. On
the other hand, the MBL transition happening for α > 2
belongs to the Anderson type universality class for short
range system where SPSs are exponentially localized60 .
We note that ν satisfies Harris criteria56 for the MBL
transition in both the sides of α = 2. It is worth mentioning that the change in the universality class is also
visited in the field of quantum spin chain where the range
of spin-spin interaction is tuned62 . It is indeed a strength
of the RG analysis that even without considering a microscopic Hamiltonian, it can signal the change in the
universality class while range of tunneling matrix element
Γij is varied.
We shall now investigate the behavior of normalized
maximum block size (MBS) ξ/L. As stated above, MBS
acquires the value of 1 in the delocalized phase while in
the localized phase ξ/L → 0. Let us begin by analyzing the Fig. 5(a) and Fig. 5(b) where ξ/L is shown for
different L with α = 1.2 and α = 2.5, respectively. Findings suggest that delocalization (ξ/L ∼ 1) to localization

separated by R. Now the notion of the resonant pair
comes in the picture when the system resides in a delocalized ergodic phase i.e., spins at different sites can club together and behave as a collective spin. In this phase, the
probability to form a resonant pair is P (R) ∼ U0 /(W Rα )
where U0 the energy scale spin-spin interaction and W is
the disorder strength. The density of resonant pair of size
R is then given by np (R) ∼ nRd P (R) ∼ nW −1 R−α+d .
Hence the total number of spin within a volume of Rd becomes Ñ (R) ∼ nW −1 R−α+2d . The effective average dis−1/d
tance is given by np . The effective interaction within
this average distance then takes the form

FIG. 5. (Color online) We here present the findings for maximum block size (MBS). (a):normalized MBS ξ/L shows a
transition from high value (delocalized phase) to low value
(localized phase), although, the intersection points shifts to
higher values of W as one increases system size from L = 100
to 500. Here α = 1.2. (b): We repeat (a) for α = 2.5. Remarkably we find that there exists a sharp transition point
Wc = 3.3 irrespective of the system size L. (c): We show
the intersecting Wi follows similar logarithmic scaling with L
(depicted by the best fit dashed lines) as obtained from EE:
Wi = γ ln L. γ reduces with increasing α < 2. The solid red,
black and green are numerical data points. (d): We show a
scaling of ξ/L with L in a semi-log scale with W = 20.0 as
depicted by solid red, black and green points. The area law
is guaranteed in the localized phase for W ∗ = 3.0 as shown
by the violet dashed line.

(ξ/L  1) crossover is undergoing for all values of L if we
increase W sufficiently W > max{Wi }. The intersection
window ∆W appears a bit earlier than the one observed
in EE for α = 1.2. Figure 5(c) clearly indicates that
Wi logarithmically scales with L. The crossover in the
finite size system would corresponds to a proper transition phenomena if we renormalize W following the same
scaling formula (2); similar to the case of EE, here also
one can define a sharp transition point and data collapse.
On the other hand, ξ/L shows a clear transition point at
Wc = 3.3 for α = 2.5 without any renormalization of
disorder strength. Therefore, the qualitative differences
between these two transitions occurring for α < 2 (i.e.,
long range limit) and α > 2 (i.e., short range limit) are
also visible from MBS analysis. Lastly, Fig. 5(d) suggests
that proper renormalization of W can guarantee the area
law (depicted by violet dashed line) in the localized phase
for α < 2; the deviation from area law is an artifact of
the finite size crossover phenomena.
We shall now make resort to an analytical formulation where one can qualitatively understand the crossover
phenomena in the finite size system29 . Let us begin by
considering a d-dimensional hypercube disordered long
range model with N (equivalent to L) interacting spin1/2 particle with spatial density n. Here two spins are

Therefore, combining these two energy scales in
Eq. (4) and Eq. (5), one can infer that the resonance
can only proliferate if effective interaction exceeds the
characteristic energy. The condition we obtain then
α(α − d)
α
< .
(6)

d
This can be simplified as α < 2d. One can thus argue that
delocalization can take place for sufficiently large system
L  R when α < 2d. In the above argument we concentrate only on the exponent associated with R and subside
the influence of disorder strength W . Therefore, the limit
of large L limit requires proper scaling of W with the system size. What we mean by that is the following: for a
given disorder strength W , tendency towards delocalization increases with L and, equivalently, for a given system
size L, tendency towards localization increases with increasing W . Therefore, critical length Lc (W ) or critical
disorder Wc (L) both can exist. The above line of argument further suggests that if the system size becomes
comparable with the size of the resonant pair L ' R
and Ñ (L) ∼ 1: one can obtain Wc (L) ∼ L(2d−α)/α
and similarly, Lc (W ) ∼ W α/(2d−α) . Hence, interestingly,
for finite L true localization transition happens to be a
crossover. Moreover, for α < 2d, Ñ (L) ranges from very
small value to large value as L varies from very small
value to large value referring to the fact that many-body
delocalization transition is taking place. If thermodynamics limit is taken by considering W and L both simultaneously to infinity keeping W/Wc (L) fixed, one obtains
localized phase for W > Wc (L) and delocalized phase for
W < Wc (L). One can connect it to phase diagram obtained in W − L plain as represented in Ref.31 .
Now the interesting question is how much it is true
that Wc follows an algebraic scaling with L. The resonances occurring inside the system are not of very simple type rather the emerging network of the many-body

8
states coupled by these resonances has a treelike structure. To be precise, resonant structure in the manybody Hilbert space can be viewed as a random regular graph30,31,63 . Moreover, the resonances can be identified distinctly from those encountered on the previous step resulting in an emergence of spectral diffusion
factor64 . Under these circumstances, lattice with connectivity K  1, the critical value of disorder enhanced
by a factor of ln K. Generally, for a lattice of size L,
K = f (L). Hence, Wc should contain a logarithmic and
an algebraic factor dependent on L. However, in this
present case, we find Wc scales as logarithmically. This
could be an artifact of finite size limitation. As we know,
in the large L limit ln L can be suppressed by the algebraic factor while in the small L limit, ln L would be
predominant over the algebraic factor. We additionally
note that in our case of nearest neighbour short range
interaction might not be able to capture the accurate
scaling of critical disorder with finite size of the system;
furthermore, long range interaction might enhance localization and lower the critical disorder as compared to the
short range interaction32,58 . The MBL phase is found to
be destabilized once the long range interaction decays
slower than exponentially59 . We would like to reiterate
that in the thermodynamic limit L → ∞, MBL phase for
α > 2, obtained following macroscopic RSRG scheme,
might suffer from instability. The algebraic nature of the
coupling i.e., algebraic localization can cause this instability. However, from numerical ED study it is not very
conclusive that what is the effect of long range interaction
on MBL transition65 .

B.

Microscopic RG

Even though, we believe our previous RSRG scheme
in Sec. III A is able to capture the main essence of the
long-range models. In this section, we again do similar
studies but now incorporate the microscopic details of a
particular long-range Hamiltonian in the RSRG Scheme.
Specially, using the microscopic RG scheme, the role of
instability of MBL for α > 2 can probed more extensively
even with finite size of system L ∼ O(102 ). The specific
long-range microscopic model, we use to modify the RG
scheme is described by the following Hamiltonian,

respectively. For α > 1 the single particle states of
this Hamiltonian are algebraically localized. We first
carry out ED calculation of this non-interacting Hamiltonian and obtain all single particle energies and eigen-

FIG. 6. (Color online) We here present the findings of EE
putting the microscopic detail of the Hamiltonian (7) in our
RG scheme . (a) EE density S/L decreases from 1 with
increasing the disorder strength W for L = 100, 200, 300,
and 500. Here α = 1.2. The intersection points of S/L
curve between different values of L, shifts to higher values
of W as one increases system size. (b): Intersection points
obtained from (a), depicted by solid red, green and brown
points, scales with system size as L2−α ln L that is represented by the dashed lines. The logarithmic fitting lnL as
depicted by solid lines are not are in good agreement with
the numerical data points, specifically, for α = 1.2 and 1.5.
(c) We again show the variation of S/L with rescaled disorder strength W ∗ = W/L2−α ln L. We identify the transition
point as Wc∗ = 0.19. In the inset, we show data collapse
S/L = f ((W ∗ − Wc∗ )L1/ν ) for ν = 2.25 and for W ∗ > Wc∗ .
(d): We show a scaling of S/L with L in a log-log scale with
W = 80.0 as depicted by solid red points. The area law is
guaranteed for W ∗ = 1.0 in the localized phase as depicted
by the dashed violet line.

states. Given that a typical single-particle eigenstate
with eigenenergy i is of the form ψi ∼ 1/|i − r0 |α ,
where r0 6= i is the localization center. We now initialize our RG scheme by defining ∆Eij = |i − j | i.e., the
difference between the eigenenergies of the Hamiltonian
(7). We consider Γij = 1/|i0 − j0 |α where i0 , j0 are the
localization center correspond to the i-th and j-th eigenstate of the Hamiltonian. We note that the interacting
version of this model has been studied where the MBL
phase is characterized by the algebraically decaying tails
of an extensive number of integrals of motion, unlike the
case of exponentially localized SPSs66 .
In Fig. 6(a), we show the variation entanglement density as function of W for different values of L. Similar to
the outcome from macroscopic scheme, the intersection
point Wi shifts to higher value with increasing L; we note
that the window ∆W and the values of Wi both acquire
higher values compared to the earlier case. In order to
search for the sharp transition point, we then try to estimate the proper scaling law of Wi with L in Fig. 6(b) for
α = 1.2, 1.5 and 1.8. Interestingly, the microscopic in-

This form of renormalization confirms the predicted scaling by Mirlin etal.31 following an ED scheme in interacting spin model where hopping and interaction both
considered to be long range. Even though, the microscopic input that we use here is from a long-range noninteracting model (7), but our RSRG scheme does not
incorporate long-range interaction. Interestingly, we still
manage to mimic the underlying physics of the long
range model unanimously irrespective of the range of
interaction65 . The scaling form (8) also matches well
with the analytical prediction in the context of random
regular graph30 that we discussed in Sec. (III A). Hence,
microscopic detail in RG scheme helps in obtaining more
accurate behavior for the observables. We further check
that logarithmic scaling Wi ∼ lnL (as depicted by solid
lines in Fig. 6 (b)) is not the accurate renormalization of
Wi for the microscopic RG scheme. Here, the algebraic
scaling form prevails referring to the fact that finite size
effect is relatively minimized compared to macroscopic
RG scheme.
A very recent ED study shows that long-range interaction is not able to influence the thermal-MBL transition property of the system in a noticeable manner65 .
Contrastingly, MBL might persist in the presence of
long-range interactions though long-range hopping with
1 < α < 2 delocalizes the system partially, while almost
all the states are extended for α ≤ 1. On the other
hand, our study of microscopic RSRG study with short
range diagonal interaction indicates the fact that critical
disordering follow similar scaling with L as observed in
long-range interacting system.
Similar to the Fig. 4(a), the EE density for different L
coincide with each other when W ∗ < Wc∗ = 0.33, after
that they start deviating from each other for W ∗ ≥ Wc∗ .
For W ∗  Wc∗ , the saturation values of EE density
increases with decreasing L. Comparing Fig. 4(a) and
Fig. 6(c), one can see that the tendency towards saturation is more once the RSRG scheme is embedded with the
microscopic detail. Now we shall investigate the scaling
form of S/L = f ((W ∗ − Wc∗ )L1/ν ) from the data collapse
analysis as shown in Fig. 6(c). We show here that with
ν = 2.25 ± 0.3, one can obtain a nice data collapse for
W ∗ ≥ Wc∗ . We also checked the critical properties for
α = 2.5 where we find exponent ν = 2.9 ± 0.27. Hence,
these values of the critical exponent are well corroborated
to their counterpart obtained from macroscopic RSRG
approach satisfying the Harris criterion56 . Therefore, microscopic RG reconfirms that the universality class for
α < 2 is different than that of the for α > 2. Finally,
in Fig. 6(d), we show that the area law (violet dashed
line) is recovered for localized phase in the the regime
W ∗  Wc∗ .
We now show the variation of S/L with W for α = 2.5

FIG. 7. (Color online) The behavior of EE density as a function of disorder strength W is shown for microscopic RSRG
scheme for α = 2.5 in (a). It clearly suggests that there is finite delocalization-localization cross-over window in W {Wi }
for α = 2.5. We then try to estimate the behavior of Wi with
the system size L considering
√ two fitting function m ln L + n
(dashed lines) and p exp(q ln L) (solid lines) as shown √
in (b).
One can observe that for α being well above 2, p exp(q ln L)
yields apparently better fit compared to m ln L + n. We find
m = 17.2, 16.5, 9.1, 1.0, and n = −78.3, − 79.2, −
43.9, − 3.5 for α = 2.2, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, respectively. We
find p = 4.0 × 10−4 , 4.8 × 10−6 , 2.5 × 10−6 , 0.9 × 10−7 and
q = 4.5, 6.2, 6.1, 6.0 for α = 2.2, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, respectively.

using the microscopic RSRG approach in Fig. 7. Unlike
the case of the macroscopic RSRG scheme, here we find
that Wc increases with L even for α > 2. However, the
scaling of Wc with L becomes much slower compared
to the one obtained before for α < 2. Figure. 7 shows
the variation of Wc with L for α = 2.2, 2.5, 3.0, and
3.5. We find almost equally good agreement by fitting
our results with
√ two functional forms 1) ∼ ln L and 2)
∼ exp(const ln L). The later one has been predicted in
Ref.58,63 for α > 2 in presence of long-range interactions.

IV.

COMPARISON BETWEEN MICROSCOPIC
AND MACROSCOPIC RSRG

In this section, we compare between two RSRG
schemes which we have used in this work. Even though,
both RSRG approaches conclude the critical disorder
strength Wc is an increasing function of L, the finite size
scaling of Wc are not very different in two approaches
at least for α < 2. While the microscopic RSRG predicts Wc (L) ∼ L2−α ln L , the macroscopic RSRG predicts Wc (L) ∼ Lη ln L with η  2 − α for α < 2. We
believe that one of the main reason behind this discrepancy is due to the difference between the spacing distribution of the on-site energies in two approaches. In

10
the microscopic RSRG scheme, the initial on-site energies have been taken from an uniform random distribution and hence, spacing distribution is Poissonian. On
the other hand, in the microscopic RSRG approach, the
on-site energies are taken from the eigenvalues of the microscopic Hamiltonian (7), the spacing distribution of
eigen-energies of the Hamiltonian (7) are not exactly
Poissonian67 , they show the signature of level-repulsion
at least for α < 2. Hence, the microscopic RSRG scheme
promotes avalanche mechanism58,59 . This is presumably
the reason the scaling Wc (L) with L is much faster in
this scheme compared to macroscopic RSRG scheme.
Now we investigate the distribution of the normalized MBS ξ/L for both RSRG schemes and for α = 1.5
and 2.5. We show our results for 4 different values of
quenched disorder of strength W in Fig. 8. One value of
W is chosen such that W  Wc (L) (denoted with black
points in the Fig. 8), for which the peak of the distribution is at ξ/L ' 1 signifying complete delocalization.
Another value of W is chosen such that W  Wc (L) (denoted with blue points in the Fig. 8), for which the peak
of the distribution is at ξ/L  1 and that signifies complete localization. On the other hand, we also show the
results for two other values of W , which are taken from
the vicinity of Wc (denoted with red and green points in
the Fig. 8). The MBS distribution shows bi-modal distribution having two peaks one at ξ/L ' 1 and another at
ξ/L  1. The presence of cluster with MBS ' L in this
regime might refer to the instability of phase transition;
the system flows towards the thermalizing phase due to
its inbuilt avalanche mechanism.
There is no significant qualitative differences between
the distribution of MBS in two RG approaches. However,
the inset plots of S/L vs W suggest (insets of Fig. 8)
that within the microscopic RSRG approach the plateau
region of EE for W  Wc is absent (S/L starts decreasing as soon as W is increased) in comparison to
the macroscopic RSRG scheme. This leads to a few
quantitative differences while the distribution of MBS is
studied. The height of the peak of MBS distribution at
ξ/L ∼ 1 for W  Wc is much less (C ∼ 0.5) for the
microscopic RSRG compared to the macroscopic RSRG
scheme (C ∼ 1). In particular, for delocalized phase observed following microscopic RG, histogram of MBS C
gets distributed over a range 0.5 ≤ ξ/L ≤ 1.0 which is
not observed for macroscopic RG. On the other hand,
the disorder window of cross-over region showing the bimodal distribution becomes shortened for macroscopic
RG compared to microscopic RG. This enhancement in
the cross-over window for microscopic RG again refers to
the fact that Wc -L scaling can differ.
We now show the behavior of the cross-over window
∆W = Wi (Lmax ) − Wi (Lmin ) as a function of α for
macroscopic RG and microscopic RSRG scheme in Fig. 9
(a) and (b), respectively, where Lmax and Lmin are the
largest and the smallest system sizes used for our numerical calculations. It is evident from the plot ∆W vs. α for
macroscopic RSRG , ∆W is significantly small for α > 2

four representative points with specified W . One can clearly
observe from both of the RSRG scheme that the distribution pattern changes from uni-modal (when system remains
deep inside localized/ delocalized phase) to bi-modal (when
the system in the vicinity of delocalization-localization crossover window). For α = 2.5, disorder window of W within
which bi-modal distribution appears, gets reduced compared
to α = 1.5.

compared to α < 2 . Hence, it is almost impossible to
find finite size scaling of Wi in this parameter regime. On
the other hand, within microscopic RSRG scheme ∆W
remains relatively large even for α > 2, hence, it has been
possible to study the system size dependence of Wc (L)
in this parameter regime, which seems to satisfy
√ the following scaling function: Wc (L) ∼ exp(const ln L). In
addition, we also note that area law of EE is satisfied for
α > 2 for both of the cases without rescaling the disorder
strength. Therefore, there are some qualitative changes
occurring around α = 2 which need to be addressed more
extensively in future.
We also like to emphasize that even within macroscopic
RSRG approach ∆W for α ≥ 2, is not strictly zero even
for our choice of system sizes as shown in Fig. 9 (a).
However, the variation of Wi with L within macroscopic
RSRG approach is very small, when L ∈ [50, 500]. Hence
one does not even need to re-scale W with appropriate
L dependent scaling functions to see delocalization-MBL
transition (as shown in Fig. 2 (b)). This does not necessarily mean that MBL phase is stable in the thermodynamic limit. There is always a possibility that if we
could manage to do our calculations for significant large
system sizes compared to what we have presented here,
we might obtain ∆W large enough to find system size
dependence scaling function for Wc . Strikingly, in the
microscopic RSRG approach even for L ∈ [50, 500], we
find ∆W to be large enough to extract a L dependent
scaling function for Wc , which proves the instability of
MBL phase in these models in the thermodynamic limit.

CONCLUSION

In this work, we propose a new RSRG scheme to investigate thermal-MBL transition in a one-dimensional
long-range models with hopping t ∼ r−α , where SPSs are
algebraically localized with localization exponent α > 1.
Within this approach, in presence of nearest neighbour
interaction, we show that indeed there is a crossover between delocalized and localized phase as a function of
quenched disorder W for α < 2. In last few years, there
have been several studies leading to conflicting claims
about the true nature of this transition29,65 . Most of
those studies involve ED that is restricted within small
system size. Our RSRG approach allows us to extend
system size up to L ' 500, with which we can investigate the finite size scaling of transition points systematically. Even though this scaling appears to be dependent
on RG scheme, the most realistic implementation of RG
rules predicts the scaling to be ∼ L2−α ln L. This form
supports the prediction of Ref.31 . We hence propose that
one can still talk about thermal-MBL transition in appropriate thermodynamic limit as function of rescaled
quenched disorder W ∗ = W/L2−α ln L. Moreover, the
apparent deviation from the area law in the MBL phase
is also remarkably resolved upon considering W ∗ . Most

interestingly, with this non-trivial rescaling for α < 2, we
obtain different correlation length exponents associated
with the transition which is qualitatively and quantitatively different from a usual MBL transition observed in
short range system. On the contrary, the MBL transition
for α > 2 requires no rescaling of W and surprisingly, it
belongs to the same Anderson type universality class for
the short range systems.
A recent study claims the range of interactions does not
influence the thermal-MBL transitions as long as longrange hopping is present in the systems 65 . The finite size
scaling of the critical disorder strength obtained from our
calculations matches with analytical prediction for longrange interacting models 31,58 . Our findings qualitatively
supplement ED results along with the possibility that
α = 2 can be a special point. However, for long-range
hopping system without diagonal interaction, the MBL
transition might occur for a > 3/268 ; with diagonal interaction the crossover point a = 3/2 is not found to be
conclusive22 . Combining all these above discussions, we
can infer that the location of the exact crossover point
for short range diagonal interaction (long-range hopping)
is a subject of further study.
One can note that the apparent dissimilarity in the
scaling of critical disorder for macroscopic and microscopic RSRG, might be caused by the average level spacing statistics of the initial input energies of these model
e.g., macroscopic RSRG supports Poissonian distribution while for microscopic RSRG it deviates towards
Wigner-Dyson distribution. This promotes the avalanche
mechanism58,59 in the system, and destabilizes the MBL
phase faster. In this context of stability of MBL phase
for short range system, it is also important to mention
the recent studies. These suggest that in order to observe
a MBL transition, one needs to consider thermodynamically large systems supporting Thouless time scale comparable to Heisenberg time scale28,69–71 . We believe that
it would be interesting to investigate these time scales for
long-range systems as well.
The statistics of many-body energy levels of long-range
systems is experimentally investigated in superconducting circuit72 and trapped ion73–75 . On the other hand,
long range hopping is also realized in laboratory42,44 . We
therefore believe that our findings can be experimentally
testable in near future. One natural extension to our
work would be to analyze the effect of long range interaction and probe the MBL transition which has already been investigated using self-consistent theory and
ED32,76 . An sub-extensive law of EE in the localized
phase is clearly observed for non-interacting system38 ;
then the question becomes in presence of interaction is
this law suppressed and EE tends toward the area law.
Hence, a possible future direction would be to critically
analyze the scaling of EE in a thermodynamically large
system with various other RSRG scheme incorporating
appropriate microscopic detail. On the other hand, the
existence of Floquet time crystal in this long range model
can be another field of research.
