Working with Hamiltonians from chiral effective field theory, we develop a novel framework for describing
arbitrary deformed medium-mass nuclei by combining the in-medium similarity renormalization group with
the generator coordinate method. The approach leverages the ability of the first method to capture dynamic
correlations and the second to include collective correlations without violating symmetries. We use our scheme
to compute the matrix element that governs the neutrinoless double beta decay of 48 Ca to 48 Ti, and find it to have
the value 0.61, near or below the predictions of most phenomenological methods. The result opens the door to
ab initio calculations of the matrix elements for the decay of heavier nuclei such as 76 Ge, 130 Te, and 136 Xe.

Introduction. The discovery that neutrinos oscillate [1–4]
and thus have mass has increased the significance of neutrinoless double beta (0νββ) decay [5], a hypothetical rare process in which a parent nucleus decays into a daughter with
two fewer neutrons and two more protons, while emitting two
electrons but no (anti)neutrinos. The search for this leptonnumber-violating process has become a priority in nuclear and
particle physics; its observation would have fundamental implications for the nature of neutrinos, physics beyond the Standard Model, and cosmology.
0νββ decay can result from the exchange of heavy particles
in lepton-number violating theories, but whatever the cause, a
nonzero decay rate implies a contribution from the exchange
of a light Majorana neutrino, and we focus on that contribution
here. If it dominates, the inverse 0νββ half life is given by

where me is the electron mass, gA the axial-vector coupling,
and G0ν ∼ 10−14 yr−1 is a phase-space factor [6–8]. The
P 2
effective Majorana neutrino mass hmββ i =
k U ek mk contains physics beyond the Standard model through the masses
mk and the elements Uek of the Pontecorvo-Maki-NakagawaSakata flavor-mixing matrix. Certain combinations of these
parameters have been measured, but the individual masses mk
and the combination mββ are still unknown. Equation (1) provides a way to determine hmββ i from a measured half life
(which must be significantly longer than that of any other
process ever observed) if the nuclear matrix element (NME)
M 0ν = hF|O0ν |Ii of the decay operator O0ν between the ground
states of the initial (I) and final (F) nuclei is known. (See Ref.
[9] for the precise form of O0ν .) Since the NME cannot be
measured, it must be computed from theory.
Although calculating an NME is straightforward in principle, the values predicted by nuclear models differ by factors
of up to three, causing an uncertainty of an order of magnitude (or more) in the half-life for a given value of mββ [10]. It
is difficult to reduce this uncertainty because each model has
its own phenomenology and uncontrolled approximations. To

avoid model dependence, several groups have begun programs
to calculate the NMEs from first principles, taking advantage
of the progress in nuclear-structure theory in recent decades
[11–22]. However, applying modern ab initio methods to ββ
decay poses a significant challenge. The 0νββ candidate nuclei are generally heavier and more structurally complicated
than those treated so far, and the NME entails a much more
involved calculation than do matrix elements of the Hamiltonian or other simple operators. Recently, ab initio quantum
Monte Carlo methods have been used to calculate NMEs [23],
but only in very light nuclei that are of no interest to experimentalists.
Among the ab initio methods that can be applied to heavier
nuclei, the in-medium similarity renormalization group (IMSRG) [17, 18] seems particularly promising because its time
and memory requirements scale polynomially with the underlying single-particle basis size, and depend only indirectly
on the particle number A. The IMSRG uses a flow equation
to gradually transform the Hamiltonian so that a preselected
“reference state” becomes the ground state. Like the similar
coupled-cluster approach [16], the method has thus far been
applied only to spherical nuclei, which require only relatively
simple reference states. Here, we extend the IMSRG to deformed nuclei by combining it with the generator coordinate
method (GCM) [24, 25], which successfully describes nuclei with complex shapes in nuclear density functional theory
(DFT) [26–28]. This innovation removes the heavy burden
of capturing collectivity from the IMSRG by using it in conjunction with deformed reference states and subsequently full
GCM wave functions rather than single Slater determinants.
Importantly, it does so without introducing new phenomenology; our ab initio method starts from interactions derived from
chiral effective field theory (EFT), the parameters of which are
fixed in the lightest nuclei, and systematically approaches an
exact solution of the Schrödinger equation as approximations
are removed. We have already tested our new many-body approach in a small shell-model space with a phenomenological
Hamiltonian [10] and in large spaces with a chiral Hamiltonian in nuclei with A = 6 [30]. Here, we compute the NME

2
for the 0νββ decay of 48 Ca to the deformed nucleus 48 Ti. This
particular decay is a natural starting point because 48 Ca is the
lightest candidate for an experiment, and a program to use it
already exists [31].
Methods. The starting point for any ab initio calculation
is a Hamiltonian with coupling constants fit to reproduce
data in few-nucleon systems. We take ours from chiral EFT,
which systematically organizes interaction terms by powers
of a ratio of a typical nuclear momentum scale and a larger
hadronic scale. The fit of parameters for the two-nucleon interaction, carried out at next-to-next-to-next-to leading order
(N3 LO) with a momentum cutoff of 500 MeV/c, is from Entem and Machleidt (EM) Entem and Machleidt [5]. We use the
free-space (not in-medium) similarity renormalization group
(SRG) [6] to transform the interaction so that it has a “resolution scale” of either λ = 1.8 or 2.0 fm−1 . Following Refs.
[1, 7], we construct the three-nucleon interaction directly, with
a chiral cutoff of Λ = 2.0 fm−1 . We refer to the resulting
Hamiltonians as EMλ/Λ, e.g., EM1.8/2.0 ( see Supplemental
Material and Refs. [1, 7] for further details).
To make our Hamiltonians easier to use, we normal order
the three-body interaction with respect to an A = 48 Slaterdeterminant reference state and omit the residual three-body
terms, in what is called the normal-ordered two-body (NO2B)
approximation. We also completely drop all three-body matrix elements involving states with single-particle energies ei
(in units of ~ω, the harmonic-oscillator spacing for our working basis) that sum to e1 + e2 + e3 > 14. We let H(0) stand for
all Hamiltonians generated by these procedures.
Once we have an appropriate H(0), we combine the IMSRG with the GCM to compute properties of 48 Ca and 48 Ti,
in particular their ground-state wave functions and the NME
between them. Roughly speaking, this task has two steps. The
first, as mentioned above, is the construction of a transformed
Hamiltonian for which our chosen reference states are good
approximations to the ground states. We obtain these states
by using H(0) in particle-number projected Hartree-FockBogoliubov (HFB) calculations, with variation after projection [25]. This allows us to explicitly include collective deformation and pairing correlations, which, as we noted earlier, are difficult to generate in the particle-hole-like expansion underlying the IMSRG as practiced so far [18, 36, 37].
The IMSRG flow equation [38] then creates a set of uniR s0
tary transformations U(s) ≡ eΩ(s) = S exp 0 η(s0 ) ds0 (an sordered exponential), where s is the flow parameter and η(s)
is a “generator” that is chosen to make the reference states
increasingly close to ground states as s increases. We employ the Brillouin generator [18], which produces steepest descent in the energy Tr[ρH(s)], where ρ is a density operator
and we use the notation that for any “bare” operator O(0),
O(s) ≡ exp[Ω(s)]O(0) exp[−Ω(s)] is the transformed operator
at flow-parameter s. To make the flow equation tractable, we
truncate all such operators at the NO2B level as well.
Here we encounter a subtlety. If we were treating only a
single nucleus (and were not truncating operators), the ref-

erence state would be the ground state of the RG-improved
Hamiltonian H̃ ≡ H(s = ∞), with the exact ground state energy as its eigenvalue. But our NME calculation requires the
ground states of both the initial and final nuclei, and so we
adapt ideas from Ref. [39] by defining a reference ensemble
via the density operator ρ = cI |ΦI ihΦI | + cF |ΦF ihΦF |, where
|ΦI,F i are the symmetry-restored states with J π = 0+ obtained
by projecting the lowest-energy quasiparticle vacua for each
nucleus onto good angular momentum and particle number,
and cI + cF = 1. Using the techniques of Refs. [40, 41], we
normal-order our Hamiltonian with respect to this reference
ensemble, again discarding explicit three-body pieces to make
the subsequent IMSRG evolution feasible. Then, though neither |ΦI i nor |ΦF i are eigenvectors of H̃ at the end of the evolution, both are reasonable approximations to eigenvectors.
We tolerate loss of exact eigenstates at this stage of the calculation in order to use a single set of transition operators, the
lack of which complicated the calculations in Ref. [10].
So much for our procedure’s first step. The second improves the approximate eigenstates of H̃, which at the conclusion of the flow are the original reference states. Because
the IMSRG evolution incorporates dynamic correlations, involving only a few nucleons, into the RG-improved Hamiltonian H̃, we should be able to obtain close-to-exact eigenvectors by admixing into the states |ΦI,F i other states that differ only in their collective parameters, to allow fluctuations
in the deformation and pairing condensate. We thus use H̃ to
perform a second set of projected-HFB calculations that generate multiple (nonorthogonal) number-projected quasiparticle vacua |ΦZN (Q)i where Q = {qµ , φ} encompasses the collective coordinates most important for spectra and the NME
[42]: quadrupole moments qµ = hΦZN (Q)|r2 Y2µ |ΦZN (Q)i
and an isoscalar (proton-neutron) pairing amplitude φ =
hΦZN (Q)|P†0 + P0 |ΦZN (Q)i. Here P†0 , defined precisely in
Ref. [43], creates a correlated isoscalar pair. We construct
low-lying eigenstates by further projecting the |ΦZN (Q)i onto
states with well-defined angular momentum, |JMZN(Qi )i,
and superposing them using the GCM ansatz
X
|Ψ JMZN i =
F JZN (Qi ) |JMZN(Qi )i .

The weights F JZN (Qi ) are determined by minimizing the expectation value of the evolved Hamiltonian H̃, a procedure
that leads to the Hill-Wheeler-Griffin equation [25]. Since our
approach involves a Hamiltonian, we do not suffer from the
spurious divergences and discontinuities that affect GCM applications in nuclear DFT [44, 45].

from the EM1.8/2.0 interaction, with emax = 8 and ~ω = 16
MeV. For convenience, we use the bare rather than the evolved
quadrupole operators to define β and γ; this convention has no
effect on computed observables. The figure shows that the energy of 48 Ca is minimized for a spherical shape (β = 0, γ = 0),
and that the energy of 48 Ti has a similarly pronounced minimum at a prolate shape with β ∼ 0.2 and γ = 0. The effect
of triaxiality on the low-lying states of both nuclei and on the
NME is negligible.
We compute all observable quantities with the chiral interactions discussed above, for a range of emax and ~ω values (see Supplemental Material for details.) With EM1.8/2.0,
which produces satisfactory ground-state and separation energies through mass A ∼ 80 [2–4, 48], we obtain extrapolated
ground-state energies of -418.26 MeV and -422.27 MeV for
48
Ca and 48 Ti, respectively. Our calculation yields the correct ground-state ordering, but our Qββ =5.57 MeV is somewhat larger than the experimental Q value, 4.26 MeV.
Figure 2 shows the low-lying states of 48 Ti for the same
interactions. The spectrum is clearly rotational but slightly
stretched, a result of our focus on the ground state. Importantly, however, we reproduce the collective B(E2: 2+1 → 0+1 )
reasonably well in all cases. Other ab initio calculations
severely underpredict B(E2)’s [19, 37], which are more sensitive probes of wave functions than are energies; our success is due to the explicit treatment of collectivity. The inclusion of noncollective configurations from isoscalar pairing,
not shown in the figure, slightly compresses the spectra and
changes the B(E2: 2+1 → 0+1 ) by 5-6%, e.g., from 101 e2 fm4
to 96 e2 fm4 for the EM1.8/2.0 interaction.
The energies of the low-lying states are converged to within
a few percent with respect to the basis size. For example,
the 2+ excitation energies in 48 Ti obtained with EM1.8/2.0
or EM2.0/2.0 with ~ω = 16 MeV change by no more than
3 % from emax = 6 through emax = 10 (also see Supplemental Material). Regarding the transitions, we note first that the
correction to the E2 operator from the IMSRG flow alters the
B(E2) values by less than 10%, suggesting that our collective
reference ensemble accounts for quadrupole correlations that

caused large corrections in other work [37]. Thus, we do not
expect them to change significantly as the number of shells
is increased (Fig. 4 supports our expectation). Surprisingly,
even a drastic change of the coefficients (cI , cF ) specifying
the contributions of 48 Ca and 48 Ti to the reference ensemble
from (0.5, 0.5) to (0.1, 0.9) changes the ground-state energy
by a mere 100-200 keV, excited-state energies by 5% or less,
and the B(E2) by only 1%.
We turn next to the 0νββ NME, which we compute with
the usual form for the nuclear current operator [9]. We neglect newly discovered corrections to the decay operator in
chiral EFT [51, 52] and many-body currents [53, 54]. Figure 3 displays NME contributions from components with dif-

ferent values of the generator coordinates. These contributions are multiplied by the weight functions F in Eq. (2) of
both the initial and final states, and then integrated to get the
complete NME. Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show that the contributions hardly depend on the initial deformation βI , as long as
that quantity is between −0.2 and 0.2, but vary strongly with
the final deformation βF . The significant average deformation
of 48 Ti means that the NME will be suppressed. This result
echoes the findings of DFT calculations, which show strong
quenching of NMEs between initial and final states with different shapes [55, 56]. Figures 3(c) and 3(d) illustrate how
the NME is affected by isoscalar pairing, which was shown to
be significant in valence-space GCM calculations with empirical interactions [42, 57]. The ground state of 48 Ti is dominated by configurations with βF ≈ 0.2, and at those values the
isoscalar pairing is significantly smaller than at βF = 0. Thus,
its overall effect on the NME is mild, as panel (d) demonstrates. (Isoscalar pairing in 48 Ca is negligible.)
For this reason and because GCM calculations with energy
density functionals find cancellations between isoscalar and

isovector pairing fluctuations [58], we present results without the isoscalar-pairing amplitude as a generator coordinate.
Table I lists the full NMEs of both nuclei with several interactions. The results in the largest model spaces are relatively
close to one another, ranging from 0.64 to 0.75. All results are
summarized in Fig. 4. We find a noticeable but weak correlation between the NME and the B(E2: 2+1 → 0+1 ) value in 48 Ti,
especially in our largest model space. The weakness may reflect the relative insensitivity of the NME to the correlations at
large nucleon separations that strongly affect B(E2)’s. To extrapolate our results to even larger model spaces, we perform
a Bayesian fit of the parameters in the exponential formula
[30] M 0ν (eMax ) = M 0ν (∞) + a exp(−beMax ). For the interaction EM1.8/20 with ~ω = 16 MeV, we obtain an extrapolated
NME of M 0ν (∞) = 0.57, with an extrapolation uncertainty
range of (+0.08, −0.1); with ~ω = 12 MeV we get 0.66 with
a range of (+0.03, −0.10). With the constraint that the extrapolated values for both oscillator frequencies be equal, we obtain M 0ν (∞) = 0.61 with an extrapolation uncertainty range
of (+0.04, −0.05). For EM2.0/2.0, the oscillation with emax
prevents a similar analysis. Our results carry additional uncertainties that will be investigated further by improving the IMSRG truncation and including isoscalar and isovector protonneutron pairing generator coordinates, as discussed above.
All central values for our NMEs are near or below the predictions of phenomenological models [56, 61–63]. Only a
very recent shell-model study [64] with perturbatively derived
effective interactions and operators yields an even smaller
NME of 0.3. The small size of our NMEs seems to result
from the interplay of valence-space and beyond valence-space
correlations that our no-core approach is able to capture.
Finally, we note a significant renormalization of the NME
by the IMSRG flow. With the unevolved 0νββ operator, the
NME for EM1.8/2.0 at ~ω = 16 MeV and emax = 8 is 0.31
instead of 0.78. A more detailed analysis shows that the
flow incorporates the effects of pairing in high-energy orbitals,
greatly enhancing the J = 0 contribution to the NME. Breaking down the NME by the distance between the decaying nucleons, we confirm that the largest contribution comes from
a peak around 1 fm (cf. Ref. [11]), but contributions at larger
distances are not negligible (see Supplemental Material).
Conclusions. Ab initio methods are essential for the calculation of 0νββ matrix elements with real error estimates. We
have reported the first ab initio calculation of the spectrum
and transition probabilities in a deformed medium-mass nucleus, and significant progress in the ab initio computation of
the NME for the 0νββ decay of 48 Ca. Our approach, based
on a novel method for deformed nuclei that combines the IMSRG and GCM, has been validated in light nuclei against the
no-core shell model (see Ref. [30] and a forthcoming paper)
and allows a systematic exploration of theoretical uncertainties. Here, we reproduce the low-lying (collective) spectrum
and E2 transitions of 48 Ti satisfactorily. Our B(E2) values are
much improved compared to previous ab initio calculations
[37], but retain a significant dependence on ~ω even as we enlarge the model space. This result supports the ideas behind

5
our method: Collective correlations that are omitted due to the
IMSRG truncation can be captured by sophisticated reference
states instead. Fortunately, the correlation between the NME
and the B(E2) value is weak.
Our best estimate of the NME with EM1.8/2.0 is M 0ν =
0.61; for EM2.0/2.0 it would be a few percent larger. These
values are near or below the predictions of most phenomenological approaches [10]. Isoscalar pairing can further reduce
the NME by about 17 %, but the effect might be less when the
calculation also includes isovector pairing fluctuations [58].
To assign an overall error bar, we will implement improved
IMSRG truncations [17, 36, 66], explore additional collective correlations with the GCM, include the (small) effects of
“short-range correlations” by evolving the 0νββ operator to
the same resolution scale as the interaction, and consistently
treat its contributions from higher orders in chiral EFT, including many-body currents [54, 67]. We must also account for a
leading-order contact operator [51] whose coefficient is currently unknown. We do not expect any of these steps (except
perhaps the inclusion of the contact operator) to dramatically
change the matrix element, and therefore plan to apply our
new framework to heavier double beta decay candidate nuclei,
such as 76 Ge and 136 Xe.

In our calculations, we use interactions constructed in
Ref. [1], which yield an empirically reasonable description of
finite nuclei and infinite nuclear matter [2–4].
The two-nucleon interaction is the next-to-next-to-next-to
leading order (N3 LO) potential with a momentum cutoff of
Λ = 500MeV/c constructed by Entem and Machleidt Entem and Machleidt [5], abbreviated as EM in the present
manuscript and elsewhere [1–4]. The resolution scale of this
interaction is lowered by means of a free-space similarity
renormalization group (SRG) evolution to λ = 1.8 fm−1 or
λ = 2.0 fm−1 , respectively [6]. Following the strategy of
Refs. [1, 7], the EM interaction is supplemented with a nextto-next-to leading (N2 LO order chiral three-nucleon force
with cutoff Λ = 2.0 fm−1 ≈ 400 MeV/c whose low-energy
constants cD and cE are fit to reproduce the triton binding energy and matter radius of 4 He (the values of the LECs c1 , 3, 4
are the same as those used in the EM interaction). In this way,
the authors of Refs. [1, 7] aim to account for the evolution
of an initial chiral 3NF to lower resolution, as well as any induced 3NFs from the evolution of the two-nucleon interaction.

STRUCTURE PROPERTIES

Table II lists the detailed information on the low-lying
states of 48 Ti from IMSRG+GCM calculations by mixing axi-

ally deformed configurations. One can see that the low-energy
spectra (except for the ground-state energies) and E2 transition strengths are converged rather well at emax = 10.

TABLE II. The structural properties of 48 Ti from the IMSRG+GCM
calculation with the chiral interactions, in comparison with available
data. All energies are in units of MeV and B(E2) in e2 fm4 . The
results with ∗/† are from the calculations starting from the ensemble
reference state with mixing weight (1/3, 2/3)/(0.1, 0.9). For other
cases, (1/2, 1/2) is used.

Figure 5 shows the energy surfaces of 48 Ca and 48 Ti in the
(β2 , φnp ) plane from the calculation using the EM1.8/2.0 interaction. It is seen clearly that the energy minimum is located
at β2 = 0.0 and β2 = 0.2 for 48 Ca and 48 Ti , respectively.
Besides, the energy surface is rather soft along the neutronproton isoscalar pairing amplitude φnp in both nuclei around
the energy minimum. Therefore, the wave functions of their
ground states, which are relevant for the NME of the 0νββ, are
mainly concentrated along the the valley, as illustrated in Fig.
6. We note that the inclusion of φnp degree-of-freedom only
changes slightly the energies of low-lying states. For 48 Ca ,
the ground-state energy is changed from -413.86 MeV to 413.87 MeV by the EM1.8/2.0 interaction with emax = 8 and
~ω = 16 MeV. For 48 Ti , it is changed from -418.22 MeV to 418.23 MeV. This effect decreases the excitation energy of 2+
state from 1.24 MeV to 1.17 MeV, closer to the data. Figure 7
shows the convergence behavior of the ground-state energies
as a function of the emax . The results are extrapolated with the
exponential formula E(eMax ) = E(∞) + a exp(−b · eMax ). We
find E(∞) = −418.26 MeV for 48 Ca and −422.27 MeV for
48
Ti .

Figure 12 shows distributions of the NME corresponding
to the transition from spherical 48 Ca to 48 Ti with different
quadrupole deformation and isoscalar pairing amplitude. One
can see that the quadrupole correlation quenches the NME
in both the long-ranged and short-ranged region. In contrast,
the isoscalar pairing quenches the NME mainly in the shortranged region. The distributions with deformed final states are
qualitatively similar to those obtained in phenomenological
shell-model calculation of Ref. [11], featuring the appearance
of a robust node at r12 ≈ 2.0 fm.
We decompose the C 0ν (r12 ) further into different J compo-

Figure 13 displays the r-dependence of the C pp
0 nn0 (r12 ) from
the first six largest two-body transition densities. It is seen
that the cancellation between J = 0 and J = 2 components is the main mechanism responsible for the node around
r12 = 2.0 fm, before and after which point the contribution
to the total NME is opposite. It is the large negative contribution from the J = 2 components arising from the strong
quadrupole collectivity in 48 Ti quenches the NME strongly.

negative NME values. However, the bulk of the probability is
concentrated in a rather small interval. For these reasons, we
use the mode of the posterior as a point estimate and the 68 %
highest posterior density credible interval to define its uncertainty. For ~ω = 16 MeV, we get an extrapolated value of
0.57 with an extrapolation uncertainty range of (+0.08, −0.1),
the result for ~ω = 12 MeV is 0.66 with extrapolation uncertainty range (+0.03, −0.1). To improve upon this and to get rid
of the long tails in the posterior distribution, we also perform
a combined fit where the extrapolated value is constrained to
be the same for both oscillator frequencies while the other parameters are independent. The inference on the combined data
set yields a much more narrow distribution of the extrapolated
value and reduces the probability of the slowly decaying solutions. The extrapolated value in this case is 0.61 with an
extrapolation uncertainty range (+0.04, −0.05).

EXTRAPOLATION TO INFINITE MODEL SPACE

†
‡

To get a reliable estimate of the NME extrapolated to infinite model space and its error in the presence of uncertainty in
the calculation results, we perform Bayesian inference on the
parameters of the exponential formula M 0ν (eMax ) = M 0ν (∞) +
a exp(−b · eMax ). The results are displayed in Figure 14. We
use normal priors for the extrapolated value (µ = 0.5, σ = 1)
and for the value at emax = 6, where the expectation value
is set to the central value of the calculation result and we set
σ = 0.2 to allow for some variation in the extrapolating curve.
The prior for the decay constant is a truncated normal distribution (µ = 0.5, σ = 2) with the probability density for values
less than zero removed in order to get a decaying exponential.
We assume Gaussian uncertainties on the resulting values of
the NME.
First, we perform inference separately on the emax sequences for both oscillator frequencies. The uncertainty on
the value of the NME at finite emax allows for two solutions,
one with a large decay constant and an extrapolated value in
the region of 0.6, and one with a small decay constant and
very low extrapolated value. This leads to a posterior distribution of the extrapolated value with a very long tail ranging into
