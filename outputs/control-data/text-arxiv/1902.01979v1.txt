Transport spectroscopy of two-spin states in a double quantum dot can be performed by an AC
electric field which tunes the energy detuning. However, a problem arises when the transition rate
between the states is small and, consequently, the AC-induced current is suppressed. Here, we show
that if the AC field tunes the inter-dot tunnel barrier then for large detuning the transition rate
increases drastically resulting in high current. Multi-photon resonances are enhanced by orders of
magnitude. Our study demonstrates an efficient way for fast two-spin transitions.

INTRODUCTION

A double quantum dot containing two electron spins can be used for the realization of two-qubit operations.1–6
This qubit system is attractive because it is tunable by applying appropriate voltages to surface gate electrodes.1,2
Information on the coupled spin-qubits can be extracted by electrical transport techniques.1,2 It has been demonstrated
that in double dots with spin-orbit interaction (SOI) transitions between the two-spin eigenstates can be induced by
applying an AC electric field to a gate electrode.7–9 In essence the AC field changes periodically the energy detuning
of the double dot, and the transitions give rise to current peaks when the condition nhf ≈ ∆E is satisfied. The energy
splitting of the relevant double dot eigenstates is ∆E, the AC frequency is f , Planck’s constant is h, and the integer
n denotes the ‘n-photon’ resonance. This process enables spectroscopy of the spin states by measuring the current as
a function of the AC field frequency and magnetic field.7–9
The amplitude of the AC electric field is an important parameter, because if it is small the transitions are slow and,
consequently the AC-induced current peaks are suppressed and eventually cannot be probed. This is more evident for
the peaks corresponding to n-photon resonances (n > 1) which are usually visible only when the AC field amplitude
is large.8,9 However, generating a large AC amplitude is a challenging task.10 This is one of the basic reasons that
n-photon resonances are not well studied in semiconductor quantum dot systems.
In this work, we consider a double dot (DD) in the regime of spin selective inter-dot tunneling,11 and in the presence
of an AC electric field. We focus on two SOI-coupled eigenstates, and show that when the AC field tunes the inter-dot
tunnel coupling (barrier) the singlet-triplet12 transitions can be over an order of magnitude faster compared to those
induced when the AC field tunes the energy detuning. This speedup is attractive for spin-qubit applications where
fast operations are needed. The long time scale difference has a strong impact on the AC-induced current peaks.
Specifically, the n-photon resonances which are usually suppressed and are more difficult to probe are enhanced by
orders of magnitude. As a result, the required AC field amplitude can be smaller.
Understanding the effect of tuning periodically the tunnel coupling of a DD is important from a more general
perspective. In impurity-based DDs such that formed, for example, in silicon field-effect-transistors,9,13 the position
of the dots inside the channel is unknown and the effect of applying an AC field to a gate electrode on the dot potential
is unclear. The AC field can modulate the energy detuning and/or the inter-dot tunnel coupling. This scenario has
also been suggested in gated quantum dots1,2,14 , while control over the inter-dot tunnel coupling has been explored
in various experiments.15–18

DOUBLE DOT HAMILTONIAN

We define the triplet states |T±,0 i as well as the singlet states |Snm i where n (m) indicates the number of electrons
on dot 1 (dot 2). The DD is described by the Hamiltonian
HDD = ∆[|T− ihT− | − |T+ ihT+ |] − δ|S02 ihS02 |
√
− 2Tc |S11 ihS02 | − Tso [|T+ ihS02 | + |T− ihS02 |] + H.c.
The Zeeman term is ∆ = gµB B, with g = 2, the tunnel coupling is Tc , the spin-flip tunnel coupling due to the
SOI is Tso , and the detuning is δ. We consider two SOI-coupled eigenstates and demonstrate that by tuning the
inter-dot tunnel coupling with an AC field creates strong n-photon current peaks which allow for spectroscopy of
these eigenstates at smaller AC frequencies. We prove the efficacy of this process through a comparison with the case
where the AC field tunes the energy detuning. Below we address two separate cases. In the first case, the detuning
is time periodic due to the AC field
δ(t) = ε + A sin(2πf t).

FIG. 1: The upper frames show the singlet, triplet levels E1 , E2 as a function of detuning (left), and tunnel coupling (right).
The middle (lower) frames show the singlet-triplet transition probability as a function of time when the AC field tunes the
tunnel coupling (detuning). Results for the n = 1, 2 n-photon resonance are shown for A = 4 µeV, ε = −2.5 meV, tc = 0.35
meV, and tso = 0.035 meV. P is the exact Floquet result, and Pap is the approximate result.

The second term accounts for the AC field which has amplitude A and frequency f . In the first case, the tunnelcouplings are constant in time Tc = tc and Tso = tso . In the second case, the AC field tunes the tunnel barrier, thus,
the tunnel couplings are
Tc (t) = tc + A sin(2πf t),
Tso (t) = tso + xso A sin(2πf t).
In the second case, the energy detuning is constant in time δ = ε. Some experiments8,9,19 have demonstrated that
tso < tc and we assume that the AC field satisfies this condition and take xso = tso /tc , so the ratio Tso (t)/Tc (t) is
constant in time. To compare theoretically the two cases we assume the same amplitude A and only briefly consider
different amplitudes. In the experiment the required gate voltage to generate A can be different for the two cases
and sensitive to many factors, such as, the geometry of the DD, the electrode design, as well as the material, and
screening effects.

SINGLET-TRIPLET TRANSITIONS

We focus on the two lowest eigenstates of the time independent part of HDD , |ψi i = αi |S11 i+βi |T+ i+γi |S02 i+ζi |T− i,
i = 1, 2, and refer to |ψi i as singlet and triplet eigenstates. The eigenenergies Ei shown in Fig. 1 (upper frames)
anticross due to the SOI; specifically we take B = 1.5 T, tso = 0.1tc and plot E1 , E2 versus ε for tc = 0.35 meV, and
also plot E1 , E2 versus tc for ε = −2.5 meV [Ref. 20]. Hereafter, we fix tc = 0.35 meV, tso = 0.035 meV and study
first the coherent transitions between |ψ1 i and |ψ2 i, when the DD is not coupled to the leads. We express the time
evolution of the DD state as follows
|Ψ(t)i =

5
X

si exp(−iκi t/~)|ui (t)i,

i=1

where the parameters si are determined by the initial condition. The Floquet modes |ui (t)i, and Floquet energies κi
satisfy the Floquet eigenvalue problem [HDD (t)−i~∂t ]|ui (t)i = κi |ui (t)i. This is written in a simple form using Fourier
expansion by noting that the Floquet modes have the same periodicity as that of the AC field, i.e., |u(t)i = |u(t + T )i,
T = 1/f , and the Floquet energies can be defined within the energy interval [−hf /2, hf /2). The Floquet problem is
reduced to a matrix eigenvalue problem and is solved numerically.

3
Figure 1 shows the transition probability P (t) = |hψ2 |Ψ(t)i|2 , |Ψ(0)i = |ψ1 i for B = 1.5 T, A = 4 µeV, ε = −2.5
meV, and nhf ≈ ∆E = E2 − E1 , n = 1, 2. This set of parameters does not lead to Landau-Zener dynamics, as that
studied in Ref. 21, because the system is not driven through the anticrossing point. This is inferred directly from the
dependence of E1 , E2 on the detuning and tunnel coupling (Fig. 1). When the AC field tunes the tunnel coupling the
singlet-triplet transition for the single-photon resonance (n = 1) is about 18 times faster compared to the case where
the AC field tunes the detuning. Interestingly, for the two-photon resonance (n = 2) the speedup is on the order of
300. In both cases the transitions are electrically driven mediated by the SOI.
In the weak driving regime transitions take place only between |ψ1 i, |ψ2 i and when the AC field tunes the tunnel
coupling the dynamics is captured by the approximate Hamiltonian22 W = −(∆E − nhf )/2σz + qb σx . This model
predicts the resonant transition probability Pap (t) = sin2 (2πqb t/h), with

and Jn is a Bessel function of the first kind, n = 1, 2, ... denotes the ‘photon’ index. Likewise the case where the AC
field tunes the energy detuning can be examined with the substitutions qb → qd and hbij → hdij , where
hdij = −γi γj ,

i, j = 1, 2

(3)

According to the approximate model the singlet-triplet transition times are quantified by the coupling constants
qb , qd , and these can be very different. For example, if we focus on n = 1 and when the argument of J1 is very small
[J1 (x) ≈ x/2, x ≪ 1] then to a good approximation qb /qd ≈ hb12 /hd12 [Ref. 23]. For large negative detuning where the
two spins are effectively in the Heisenberg regime hd12 ≪ hb12 , because the |S11 i character dominates significantly over
the |S02 i, hence, near the anticrossing point γ1 γ2 ≪ γ1 α2 + γ2 α1 , while the terms proportional to xso have negligible
effect. Away from the anticrossing point the terms proportional to β1 , β2 need to be included. The ratio qb /qd can be
larger for n > 1 compared to n = 1, thus a greater speedup can be achieved for the n-photon resonances. Specifically,
for the n-photon resonances qb /qd ≈ [(hb11 − hb22 )/(hd11 − hd22 )]n−1 hb12 /hd12 , with |hb11 − hb22 | > |hd11 − hd22 |.
The two upper frames of Fig. 2 show the couplings qb , qd [Ref. 23] as a function of the magnetic field B, for ε = −2.5
meV, A = 4 µeV, and nhf = ∆E for each B. In the whole B range qb /qd > 10 for n = 1, and qb /qd > 100 for n = 2
indicating an appreciable speedup when the AC field tunes the tunnel coupling. Near the anticrossing point B ≈ 0.95
T defined by E1 , E2 we have hb11 − hb22 → 0, hence qb → Ahb12 /2 for n = 1, but qb → 0 for n > 1; and similarly for qd .
Equation (1) shows that singlet-triplet transitions vanish if hb12 = 0, but this can occur far from the negative detuning
region of interest, and provided xso 6= 0, due to the (anti-) bonding character of the involved states.22
In the lower frame of Fig. 2 qb /qd is plotted as a function of the detuning for A = 4 µeV. For an order of
magnitude estimation of qb /qd the magnetic field is taken to be 0.5 T higher than that of the anticrossing point.
For large negative detuning, |S11 i dominates over |S02 i thus qb /qd ≫ 1, which indicates a significant speedup in
the singlet-triplet transition rate when the AC field tunes the tunnel coupling. For ε → 0 qb /qd decreases because
the contributions of |S11 i and |S02 i become gradually equal. Eventually, near zero detuning the situation is more
complicated and whether qb or qd is greater depends on the photon index n and the magnetic field.22
To address possible implications in the experiment we consider the scenario where the same AC voltage is applied
to a ‘tunnel-coupling gate’ and separately to a ‘detuning gate’, but results in different AC field amplitudes, Ab and
Ad respectively. We define for the n-photon resonance the effective ratio (qb /qd )(Ab /Ad )n , where qb /qd is given
above and plotted in Fig. 2 (lower frame). An effective ratio greater than unity indicates that faster transitions are
achieved by tuning with the AC field the tunnel coupling. When Ab /Ad > 1 a larger speedup is achieved compared to
Ab = Ad , and the range of the detuning in which the speedup can be probed is extended to smaller absolute values.
The opposite trends occur in the regime Ab /Ad < 1. However, even when Ab /Ad = 0.1 then for example at ε ≈ −2.5
meV, the speedup for the n = 1 − 3 photon resonances is between 2 and 5, and for the n = 4 − 6 photon resonances
is between 10 and 30. The speedup is even better for n > 6 and/or larger negative detuning. In this work, ε/tc ≈ 7
for the maximum ε considered, but ratios on the order of 100 have been probed.1,2
So far we focused on the transitions between the lowest eigenstates |ψ1 i, |ψ2 i and found that for large negative ε
a significant speedup is achieved in the transition rate when the AC field tunes the inter-dot tunnel coupling. The
dependence of the DD eigenstates on the detuning, and specifically the change of character from |S11 i to |S02 i suggests
the generalisation of this result to transitions between the higher eigenstates |ψ4 i, |ψ5 i, which are also coupled by the
SOI, provided the sign of ε is reversed, namely when ε is large positive [Ref. 22]. The large detuning regime for both
negative and positive values has been investigated in a spin-blockaded DD with an AC driven detuning.8

AC-INDUCED CURRENT

To calculate the electrical current flowing through the DD in the presence of the AC field we employ a
Floquet-Markov master equation approach.24,25 The electrons in the leads are described by the Hamiltonian
P
He = ℓ,k,σ ǫℓk d†ℓkσ dℓkσ where the operator d†ℓkσ (dℓkσ ) creates (annihilates) an electron in lead ℓ = {L, R}, with
momentum k, spin σ, and energy ǫℓk . The tunnelling Hamiltonian accounts for the interaction between the DD and
the two leads

and c†iσ is the electron creation operator on dot i with spin σ. The tunnelling rates describing tunnelling events in
and out of the DD with a change in the electron number by ±1, are calculated to second order in the dot-lead tunnel
coupling tT . The matrix elements which are involved in the tunnelling rates are spin dependent and account for
spin blockade effects. We are interested in finding the density matrix ρ(t) of the DD, and in order to facilitate the
calculations we express ρ(t) in the basis defined by the Floquet modes |u(t)i. In the steady-state we assume that
ρst (t) = ρst (t + T ), and ρst (t) is expanded in a Fourier series allowing for the equation of motion to be written in a
matrix form and to be solved numerically. Finally, using ρst (t) and the tunnelling rates we calculate the time average
current over a AC period. The dot-lead coupling constant, proportional to t2T , is Γ = 1.2 GHz (≈ 5 µeV). An important
aspect is that unlike the two-level model that examines the singlet-triplet transitions, the quantum transport model
considers all DD eigenstates to account correctly for the various populations.26,27 These are important not only for
the AC-induced peaks but also for the background current9,27 Ib for A = 0.
Figure 3 shows the current as a function of the AC field frequency f , for different AC field amplitudes A, and
B = 1.5 T, ε = −2.5 meV. Both the background and the AC-induced currents are sensitive to these two parameters.
In the upper frame of Fig. 3 the AC field tunes the inter-dot tunnel barrier. Provided A 6= 0 a current peak is formed
when the resonant condition nhf ≈ ∆E = E2 − E1 is satisfied, with n = 1, 2, ... and Ei being the two lowest
eigenenergies. Thus, the formation of the current peaks is a result of singlet-triplet transitions caused by the AC
field. The single-photon peak (n = 1) is the strongest, whereas multi-photon peaks (n > 1) are successively weaker.
By increasing the amplitude A the current peaks become stronger because the transition rates increase within the
parameter range of this study, and for weak driving the rates are proportional to qb2 . However, the system is not driven
through the anticrossing point (upper frames Fig. 1) to undergo Landau-Zener dynamics. In the chosen frequency
range up to four peaks can be seen, but peaks for n > 4 can equally well be examined.
In the lower frame of Fig. 3 the AC field tunes the energy detuning, and similarly to the upper frame a current peak
is expected when nhf ≈ ∆E. However, the situation is now different, and only the n = 1 peak can be seen, whereas
the n > 1 peaks are suppressed. In addition, the n = 1 peak is much weaker compared to the n = 1 peak in the
upper frame due to the slower transition rate, which scales approximately as qd2 . The suppression of the n > 1 peaks
results from the small value of A; n > 1 peaks are formed provided A is large. For example, for A = 400 µeV the
n = 2 peak in the lower frame [inset to Fig. 3] becomes comparable to that in the upper frame which corresponds to
A = 40 µeV. For n > 2 peaks to be formed the amplitude A has to be even larger. Charge noise arising from voltage
fluctuations on the gate electrodes can affect the AC peaks. However, the peaks can still be probed even when A is
as large as 1.3 meV [Ref. 8], and when the gate electrode design is rather limited.9 The impact of noise on the peaks
depends on the DD fabrication details.
Figure 4 shows the resonant current (maximum value) at different magnetic fields B, for A = 20 µeV and ε = −2.5
meV. The AC frequency corresponds to the (approximate) resonant frequency at each B, i.e., nhf = ∆E. The chosen
range of magnetic field B > 1 T somewhat simplifies the presentation, since for B < 1 T various allowed transitions
between DD eigenstates lead to overlapping peaks. Near the anticrossing point defined by E1 , E2 (B ≈ 0.95 T) the
resonant current in all cases is suppressed, and is approximately equal to the background current Ib . The reason is
that when A = 0 the populations of the two eigenstates forming the anticrossing are almost equal, therefore applying
the AC field has negligible effect.9 Away from the anticrossing the populations are different and the peaks can increase,
though the effect of the SOI decreases with B, so a non monotonous behaviour can be observed. Within a simplified
approach, and assuming that the weak driving regime is a good approximation the behaviour depends on the ratio
qb2 /Γ. If it is large the peak starts to decrease at a high magnetic field. When the AC field tunes the tunnel barrier
the n = 1 peak increases with B, while the n = 2 peak first increases and then starts to decrease; the relative peak
height (measured with respect to Ib ) is maximum at about 1.6 T. This large difference in the two behaviours is due

6
to the fact that qb (n = 1) ≫ qb (n = 2). The increase of the n = 1 peak occurs even at relatively high B, because the
populations are very different, and according to Fig. 2 qb decreases slowly with B in the high B regime. In contrast,
as shown in Fig. 4 when the AC field tunes the detuning only the n = 1 peak can be clearly observed, and this is now
much weaker because qb ≫ qd .
V.

CONCLUSION

We demonstrated that when the AC field tunes the inter-dot tunnel coupling the singlet-triplet transitions can be
over an order of magnitude faster compared to the case where the AC field tunes the detuning. As a result, the AC
field induced current peaks are well-formed at much smaller AC amplitude. Multi-photon resonances are enhanced
by orders of magnitude allowing for spectroscopy at smaller frequencies. Our findings are useful for quantum dot spin
qubits where fast operations are needed with small AC amplitudes and frequencies.

HDD = ∆[|T− ihT− | − |T+ ihT+ |] − δ|S02 ihS02 |
√
− 2Tc |S11 ihS02 | − Tso [|T+ ihS02 | + |T− ihS02 |] + H.c.

(S1)

Here, the singlet state |S20 i is ignored but in all the numerical computations this is taken into account. The eigenenergies and eigenstates of the two electrons are computed by solving the eigenvalue problem HDD |ψi i = Ei |ψi i. Only
the time independent part of HDD is considered and the AC field amplitude is A = 0. For simplicity, we refer to
|ψi i as singlet and triplet eigenstates even when the spin-orbit interaction is nonzero, and we label |ψi i in order of
increasing eigenenergy Ei .
Figure S1 shows the eigenenergies Ei as a function of the detuning (δ = ε for A = 0) for the same parameters as
those used in the main article B = 1.5 T, tc = 0.35 meV, tso = 0.035 meV. The two anticrossing points for ε 6= 0 are
formed by the spin-orbit interaction, and the anticrossing point for ε = 0 is formed by the inter-dot tunnel coupling.
The eigenenergies E1 , E2 are plotted by dashed lines (see also Fig. 1 in the main article) and in the main article we
examine the transitions between |ψ1 i and |ψ2 i. In Sec. IV of the Supplemental Material we generalise our findings to
the transitions between |ψ4 i and |ψ5 i whose eigenenergies E4 , E5 are plotted in Fig. S1 by dotted lines.

APPROXIMATE TWO-LEVEL HAMILTONIAN

In the main article the transitions between the two lowest singlet-triplet eigenstates |ψ1 i, |ψ2 i are studied within the
Floquet formalism. In addition an approximate two-level Hamiltonian is shown to predict the correct features. The
main advantage of this Hamiltonian is that it is time independent and its derivation follows the same methodology
as that presented in Ref. S1. For completeness we briefly outline the basic steps of the derivation here. Because
we are interested in the transitions between the two lowest eigenstates |ψ1 i, |ψ2 i whose levels E1 , E2 anticross, it is
convenient to write the total DD Hamiltonian in the energy basis |ψi i using the notation
HDD = hE + A sin(2πf t)hj .

(S2)

The matrix hE is diagonal with elements Ei , and the matrix hj contains the time independent ‘coupling’ constants
due to the AC field. For the matrix hj we have to distinguish the two different cases for the AC field: when the AC

field tunes the tunnel coupling leading to a time dependent Tc , Tso then hj = hb , and when the AC field tunes the
energy detuning leading to a time dependent δ then hj = hd . When the AC field frequency satisfies nhf ≈ E2 − E1 ,
n = 1, 2, ... and the AC amplitude is small prohibiting transitions to levels Ei , i > 2, we can assume that the dynamics
is restricted solely within E1 , E2 . Under these conditions and for the case of hb we can focus on the following 2 × 2

Here, we ignore a factor of i3n and the derived qb is the coupling constant given in Eq. (1) in the main article. The
approximation is sensitive to the size of the quantities hb11 − hb22 , and hb12 . These depend on the double dot parameters
(detuning, inter-dot tunnel coupling) as well as the magnetic field, and if these quantities are made small then qb can
still be employed for A ∼ hf . A particular case occurs at the anticrossing point where hb11 − hb22 → 0 and W12 in
Eq. (S6) has no time independent terms for n > 1. In the present work this case is not interesting, because the AC
induced current near the anticrossing point is suppressed (Fig. 4 in the main article) due to the vanishingly small
population difference of the two eigenstates forming the anticrossing.
Finally, defining ∆E = E2 − E1 the form of the Hamiltonian W is

INSPECTION OF COUPLING CONSTANTS qb AND qd

Figure S2 shows the coupling constants qb and qd (we consider everywhere the absolute values) as a function of the
energy detuning and magnetic field for the AC field amplitude A = 4 µeV and n = 1. In both cases the maximum
occurs near the anticrossing point which shifts at higher field as the detuning increases. The large negative detuning
regime, where the spins are effectively in the Heisenberg limit, is of particular interest in this work when we focus
on the transitions between |ψ1 i and |ψ2 i. In this regime qb ≫ qd suggesting that singlet-triplet transitions are much
faster when the AC field tunes the inter-dot tunnel coupling instead of the energy detuning. Specifically, for ε . −1.4
meV the transitions can be over an order of magnitude faster. Near zero detuning qb and qd are on the same order
of magnitude.
In Fig. 2 of the main article the coupling constants qb and qd are plotted as a function of the magnetic field for
large negative detuning ε = −2.5 meV. Figure S3 shows qb and qd at different detunings for the AC field amplitude

A = 4 µeV and n = 1. For positive detuning qd can be equal or greater than qb . Moreover, for ε = 0.5 meV qb = 0
at finite magnetic field B ≈ 1.8 T. The reason for this particular behaviour is that hb12 = 0 because xso 6= 0 and
the coefficients in Eq. (2) in the main article have different signs due to the (anti-) bonding character of the states.
However, in the large negative detuning regime and assuming that xso is on the order of tso /tc then hb12 6= 0, because
either positive or negative terms dominate. In contrast, hd12 6= 0 for any value of the detuning.

TRANSITIONS BETWEEN HIGHER EIGENSTATES

In the main article the transitions between the two lowest singlet-triplet eigenstates |ψ1 i, |ψ2 i are examined.
However, the derivation of the two-level Hamiltonian W suggests that W can describe equally well the transitions
between the two eigenstates |ψ4 i, |ψ5 i by simply considering the appropriate matrix elements which couple |ψ4 i to
|ψ5 i and calculating the coupling constants qb , qd . The eigenenergies E4 , E5 are shown in Fig. S1.
We focus on the singlet-triplet eigenstates |ψ4 i, |ψ5 i and plot in Fig. S4 the ratio qb /qd as a function of the energy
detuning for the AC amplitude A = 4 µeV, and n = 1 − 4. As in the main article, the magnetic field is taken to
be 0.5 T higher than that of the anticrossing point. Following the arguments given in the main article we expect
qb /qd ≫ 1 when the |S11 i component dominates over |S02 i. This condition is now satisfied for large positive detuning.
According to Fig. S4, when the AC field tunes the inter-dot tunnel coupling it results in a significant speedup in the
transition rate between the singlet-triplet eigenstates |ψ4 i, |ψ5 i. This speedup is of the same order of magnitude as
that achieved for the eigenstates |ψ1 i, |ψ2 i examined in the main article (see Fig. 2 lower panel). The basic difference
is in the range of the energy detuning. In particular, when the AC field tunes the tunnel coupling the transitions
