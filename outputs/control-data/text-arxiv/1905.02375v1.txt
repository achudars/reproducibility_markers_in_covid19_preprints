THE (IR)REGULARITY OF TOR AND EXT
MARC CHARDIN, DIPANKAR GHOSH, AND NAVID NEMATI

Abstract. We investigate the asymptotic behavior of Castelnuovo-Mumford
regularity of Ext and Tor, with respect to the homological degree, over complete intersection rings. We derive from a theorem of Gulliksen a linearity
result for the regularity of Ext modules in high homological degrees. We show
a similar result for Tor, under the additional hypothesis that high enough Tor
modules are supported in dimension at most one; we then provide examples
showing that the behavior could be pretty hectic when the latter condition is
not satisfied.

1. Introduction
There has been a keen interest in understanding the behavior of reg(I n ) as a function of n, where I is a homogeneous ideal in a polynomial ring Q = K[X1 , . . . , Xd ]
over a field. Geramita, Gimigliano and Pitteloud [15] and Chandler [5] proved that
if dim(Q/I) 6 1, then reg(I n ) 6 n · reg(I) for all n > 1. This bound need not
be true for higher dimension, due to an example of Sturmfels [24]. However, in
[25, Thm. 3.6], Swanson showed that reg(I n ) 6 kn for all n > 1, where k is some
constant. Thereafter, Cutkosky, Herzog and Trung [11, Thm. 1.1] and Kodiyalam
[21] independently showed that asymptotically reg(I n ) is a linear function of n.
Later, in [26, Thm. 3.2], Trung and Wang generalized this result over Noetherian
standard graded ring. This behavior also has been studied for powers of more than
one ideals in [1], [16] and [2].

This generalizes results of Sidman [23], Conca-Herzog [10], Caviglia [4] and
Eisenbud-Huneke-Ulrich [14, Cor. 3.1]. The equality in (1) extends to the
case when Q is standard graded, and M or N has finite projective dimension,
replacing the right hand side by reg(M ) + reg(N ) − reg(Q).

max reg ExtiQ (M, N ) + i = reg(N ) − indeg(M ),

where indeg(M ) := inf{n ∈ Z : Mn 6= 0}.
(3) [8, Thm. 2.4(2) and 3.5] An upper bound of reg(ExtiQ (M, N )) + i is given in
terms of certain invariants of M and N .
When working over standard graded algebras that are not regular (i. e. not a
polynomial ring over a regular ring), one can also bound regularity of Tor modules
under the same kind of hypothesis, for instance the following theorem, which follows
along the same lines as in the proof of [6, Thm. 5.17].
Theorem 1.1. Suppose Q is a standard graded ring over a field, but Q is not a
polynomial ring. Let M and N be finitely generated
graded Q-modules, and d :=

min{dim(M ), dim(N )}. If dim TorQ

(and for i = i0 − 1 if i0 = 1).
This implies that if Proj(Q) has isolated singularities, then the estimate in Theorem 1.1 holds true for i > dim(Q) − 2.
Over complete intersection ring, the following result controls the asymptotic
behavior with respect to both a power of an ideal and the homological degree.
Theorem 1.2. [17, Thm. 5.4] Set A := Q/(f ), where Q is a polynomial ring over
a field, and f = f1 , . . . , fc is a homogeneous Q-regular sequence. Let M and N be
finitely generated graded A-modules, and I be a homogeneous ideal of A. Then,


 
(ii) reg ExtiA (M, N/I n N ) 6 ρN (I) · n − w · 2i + e′ , ∀i, n > 0,
where e, e′ ∈ Z, w := min{deg(fj ) : 1 6 j 6 c}, and ρN (I) is an invariant defined
in terms of reduction ideals of I with respect to N .
Moreover, in [17, 6.6], Ghosh and Puthenpurakal raised the following question.
Question 1.3. For ℓ ∈ {0, 1}, do there exist aℓ , a′ℓ ∈ Z>0 and eℓ , e′ℓ ∈ Z ∪ {−∞}
such that



(ii) reg TorA
2i+ℓ (M, N ) = aℓ · i + eℓ for all i ≫ 0 ?

In this text, we are addressing these questions. We prove that the answer to (i)
is positive, even in a more general
situation, while the answer to (ii) is negative.

However, if dim TorA
(M,
N
)
6
1
for all i ≫ 0, the second question does have a
i
positive answer.
Our main positive result on these questions is the following:
Theorem A (Theorems 3.2 and 3.5). Let Q be a standard graded Noetherian
algebra, A := Q/(f ), where f := f1 , . . . , fc is a homogeneous Q-regular sequence.
Let M and N be finitely generated graded A-modules such that ExtiQ (M, N ) = 0
for all i ≫ 0.
Then,

On the negative side, we provide examples showing that the behavior of the
regularity of Tor modules could be very different without the assumptions as in the
result above.

Example A (Example 4.1). Let Q := K[Y, Z, V, W ] be a polynomial ring with
usual grading over a field K, and A := Q/(Y 2 , Z 2 ). Write A = K[y, z, v, w], where
y, z, v and w are the residue classes of Y, Z, V and W respectively. Fix an integer
m > 1. Set



A
(ii) indeg TorA
i (M, N ) = i and reg Tori (M, N ) = (m + 1)i + (2m − 2).

In this example, TorA
i (M, N ) is supported in dimension 2 for i ≫ 0, its regularity
is eventually linear, but the leading term depends on the module M and could be
arbitrarily large, opposite to the case where TorA
i (M, N ) is supported in dimension
1 for i ≫ 0 – in that case we showed the leading term would then be 22 = 1, as
compared to m + 1 here.
This shows that the finiteness result for the Tor-algebra that we prove under the
condition that TorA
i (M, N ) is supported in dimension 1 for i ≫ 0 can fail if this
hypothesis is removed. Additional results around the hypothesis on the asymptotic
dimension of Tor are given in Remark 3.10 and in Proposition 3.11.
The following example that we develop in the last section shows that the eventual
regularity of Tor could be very far from being linear,
Example B (Example 5.1). Let Q := K[X, Y, Z, U, V, W ] be a standard graded
polynomial ring over a field K of characteristic 2, and A := Q/(X 2 , Y 2 , Z 2 ). We
write A = K[x, y, z, u, v, w], where x, y, z, u, v and w are the residue classes of
X, Y, Z, U, V and W respectively. Set

2. Module structures on Ext and Tor
Most of our results are proved under the following hypothesis.
Hypothesis 2.1. The ring Q is a standard graded Noetherian algebra, A = Q/(f ),
where f := f1 , . . . , fc is a homogeneous Q-regular sequence with wj = deg(fj ), and
M, N are finitely generated graded A-modules such that ExtiQ (M, N ) = 0 for all
i ≫ 0.
2.2. Write A = A0 [x1 , . . . , xd ], where deg(xi ) = 1 for 1 6 i 6 d. When (A0 , m0 )
is local, then following the terminologies in [3, pp. 141], A is *local, i.e., it has a
unique maximal homogeneous ideal m = m0 + A+ . Setting E0 := EA0 (A0 /m0 ),
the Matlis dual of M is defined to be M ∨ := * HomA0 (M, E0 ), where (M ∨ )n =
HomA0 (M−n , E0 ) for every n ∈ Z. In view of [3, Prop. 3.6.16 and Thm. 3.6.17],
the contravariant functor (−)∨ from the category of finitely generated graded Amodules to itself is exact, and M ∨∨ ∼
= M.
2.3 (Eisenbud operators). We need to remind facts about Eisenbud operators
[12, Section 1] in the graded setup. By a homogeneous homomorphism, we mean a
graded homomorphism of degree zero. Let F : · · · → Fn → · · · → F1 → F0 → 0
be a graded free resolution of M over A. In view of the construction of Eisenbud
operators [12, pp. 39, (b)], one may choose homogeneous A-module homomorphisms
t′j : Fi+2 → Fi (−wj ) (for every i) corresponding to fj .
Thus the Eisenbud operators corresponding to f = f1 , . . . , fc are given by t′j :
F[2] → F(−wj ), 1 6 j 6 c, where [−] and (−) denote respectively shift in homological degree and internal degree.
2.4 (Graded module structures on Ext and Tor). The homogeneous chain
maps t′j are determined uniquely up to homotopy; see [12, Cor. 1.4]. Therefore the
maps
HomA (t′j , N ) : HomA (F(−wj ), N ) −→ HomA (F[2], N )
t′j ⊗A 1N : F[2] ⊗A N −→ F(−wj ) ⊗A N
induce well-defined homogeneous A-module homomorphisms

These structures depend only on f , are natural in both module arguments and
commute with the connecting maps induced by short exact sequences.

Theorem 2.5. [19, Thm. 3.1] The graded module Ext⋆A (M, N ) is finitely generated
over A[y1 , . . . , yc ] provided ExtiQ (M, N ) = 0 for all i ≫ 0.
For instance, when Q is a polynomial ring over a field, Ext⋆A (M, N ) is finitely

T = A[y1 , . . . , yc ] = A0 [x1 , . . . , xd , y1 , . . . , yc ],

by taking direct sums over even or odd homological degree components.
In view of (2.5), set a polynomial ring S := Q0 [X1 , . . . , Xd , Y1 , . . . , Yc ], where
deg(Xi ) = (0, 1) for 1 6 i 6 d and deg(Yj ) = (1, −wj ) for 1 6 j 6 c. The modules
stated in (2.6) and (2.7) are canonically Z2 -graded S-modules. For instance, the
2
(i, a)th graded component of E 2⋆ is defined to be Ext2i
A (M, N )a for (i, a) ∈ Z , while
2⋆
the actions of X1 , . . . , Xd , Y1 , . . . , Yc on E are defined by x1 , . . . , xd , y1 , . . . , yc
2(i+1)
respectively. Note that Yj ·Ext2i
(M, N ) for i ∈ Z and 1 6 j 6 c.
A (M, N ) ⊆ ExtA
Thus, in bigraded setup, we have the following result on Ext modules.
Proposition 2.7. If ExtiQ (M, N ) = 0 for all i ≫ 0, then Exteven
A (M, N ) and
odd
2
ExtA (M, N ) are finitely generated Z -graded over S = Q0 [X1 , . . . , Xd , Y1 , . . . , Yc ],
where deg(Xl ) = (0, 1) for 1 6 l 6 d and deg(Yj ) = (1, −wj ) for 1 6 j 6 c.
Recall that for every i, a ∈ Z,

A (M, N )(i,a) = ExtA

where L(i,∗) := a∈Z L(i,a) for a Z2 -graded S-module L.

Proof. By virtue of Theorem 2.5, Ext⋆A (M, N ) is a finitely generated graded module over T = A[y1 , . . . , yc ]. Therefore the graded submodules Exteven
A (M, N ) and
Extodd
A (M, N ) are also finitely generated. Since we are only extending the grading,
the proposition now follows from 2.6.

3. Linearity of regularity of Ext and Tor
2i+1
In this section, we show that reg(Ext2i
(M, N )) are
A (M, N )) and reg(ExtA
asymptotically linear in i, where M and N are finitely generated graded modules over a graded complete intersection ring A. Moreover, a similar result for Tor
modules is proved when dim(TorA
i (M, N )) 6 1 for all i ≫ 0. We use the following
result, which is a consequence of a theorem due to Bagheri, Chardin and Hà.

Proposition 3.1. [1, Thm. 4.6] Let Q0 be a commutative Noetherian ring. Set R :=
Q0 [X1 , . . . , Xd , Z1 , . . . , Zc ], where deg(Xi ) = (0, 1) for 1 6 i 6 d and deg(Zj ) =
(1, gj ) for some gj ∈ Z, 1 6 j 6 c. Let L be a finitely generated Z2 -graded Rmodule. Set Q := Q0 [X1 , . . . , Xd ], where deg(Xi ) = 1 for 1 6 i 6 d.
Then, for every l > 0, there exist al , a′l ∈ {gj : 1 6 j 6 c}, el ∈ Z ∪ {−∞} and
′
el ∈ Z ∪ {+∞} such that

(3.2)
indeg Torl (L(t,∗) , Q0 ) = t · a′l + e′l for all t ≫ 0,

where end(M ) := sup{n ∈ Z : Mn 6= 0} and indeg(M ) := inf{n ∈ Z : Mn 6= 0} for
a graded Q-module M . Hence, there exist a, a′ ∈ {gj : 1 6 j 6 c}, e ∈ Z ∪ {−∞}
and e′ ∈ Z ∪ {+∞} such that

So there exist a finite collection of integers {δpl , tlp,1 : 1 6 p 6 m}, and a subset
l

So the cardinality of each Ep,1 must be at most 2. It can be observed that the equalities (3.1) and (3.2) follow from (3.3) once we set
l
al := max{h : h ∈ Ep,1

l

and

e′l := min{δpl − al · tlp,1 : 1 6 p 6 m for which al ∈ Ep,1

Finally, one obtains the last part from (3.1) and (3.2) by choosing suitable a, a′ , e
and e′ .

Here are our results on the linearity of regularity for Ext and Tor modules.
Theorem 3.2. Let Q be a standard graded Noetherian algebra, A := Q/(f ), where
f := f1 , . . . , fc is a homogeneous Q-regular sequence. Let M and N be finitely
generated graded A-modules such that ExtiQ (M, N ) = 0 for all i ≫ 0.
Then, for every ℓ ∈ {0, 1}, there exist aℓ ∈ {deg(fj ) : 1 6 j 6 c} and eℓ ∈
Z ∪ {−∞} such that

(M, N ) = −aℓ · i + eℓ for all i ≫ 0.
reg Ext2i+ℓ
A
Proof. The theorem follows from Propositions 2.7 and 3.1.



Remark 3.3. More precisely, for every ℓ ∈ {0, 1}, Proposition 3.1 shows that, for

Q [X ,...,Xd ]
(M, N ), Q0 are
Ext2i+ℓ
any j, the initial and ending degrees of Torj 0 1
A
eventually linear functions in i.
Remark 3.4. In Theorem 3.2, if Q is regular, then the assumption on vanishing of
Ext modules over Q is superfluous.
The asymptotic linearity of regularity for Tor modules holds in certain cases.
Theorem 3.5. Let Q be a standard graded Noetherian algebra, A := Q/(f ), where
f := f1 , . . . , fc is a homogeneous Q-regular sequence. Assume Q is *local or the
epimorphic image of a Gorenstein ring. Let M and N be finitely generated graded
A-modules such that,
(i) M has finite projective
dimension over Q,

(ii) dim TorA
i (M, N ) 6 1 for any i ≫ 0.
Then, for every ℓ ∈ {0, 1}, there exist aℓ ∈ {deg(fj ) : 1 6 j 6 c} and eℓ ∈
Z ∪ {−∞} such that

reg TorA
2i+ℓ (M, N ) = aℓ · i + eℓ , ∀i ≫ 0.

We postpone the proof of Theorem 3.5 until presenting ingredients of the proof.

Remark 3.6. In Sections 4 and 5, we show that the condition (ii) in the Theorem 3.5
cannot be omitted.

Theorem 3.8. Let B → Q be a graded epimorphism, A := Q/(f ), where f :=

Then, for any q,

Also condition (i) is always satisfied if B is regular.
Proof of Theorem 3.8. Let FM
• be a graded minimal free resolution of M over A,
and I•P be a graded minimal injective resolution of P over B. Consider the double
complex K•,• defined by

and its associated spectral sequences. The double


q
v p,q
and v E2p,q = ExtpA (M, ExtqB (N, P )) .
E1 = HomA FM
p , ExtB (N, P )

According to Theorem 2.5, condition (ii) implies that the graded A[y1 , . . . , yc ]modules Ext⋆A (M, ExtqB (N, P )) are finitely generated for every q. As these are zero
⋆,q
for all but finitely many q by (i), v E∞
, for any q, as well as the homology H ⋆ of
•,•
the totalization of K are finitely generated graded A[y1 , . . . , yc ]-modules.

On the other hand, since HomB (−, IqP ) is an exact functor, if we start taking
cohomology horizontally, then we obtain the first pages of the spectral sequence:

q 
h p,q
h p,q
E1 = HomB TorA
E2 = ExtqB TorA
p (M, N ), IP ,
p (M, N ), P

and condition (iii) implies that there exists p0 such that h E2p,q = 0 unless q = r or
p,q
q = r − 1, if p ≥ p0 . Hence h E2p,q = h E∞
for p > p0 .
Taking direct sum over p > p0 +r and using the naturality of Eisenbud operators,
as in 2.4, we obtain a short exact sequence of graded A[y1 , . . . , yc ]-modules:

The middle term is a finitely generated graded A[y1 , . . . , yc ]-module, as H ⋆ is so.
Hence the assertion follows.

Remark 3.9. Notice that whenever A is *local Cohen-Macaulay (equivalently Q),
one may apply the same line of proof with B = A, P = ωA and N replaced by a
high syzygy to assume that N is maximal Cohen-Macaulay. In this particular (but
important) situation, the vertical spectral sequence abuts on step 2.
Remark 3.10. Theorem 3.8 with B *local Cohen-Macaulay
shows that if there exits

Remark 3.12. Whenever B is a standard graded Gorenstein ring over a field, and
W or P has finite projective dimension over B, the regularity of W is provided by
the formula [7, 3.2]:

o


reg(W ) = reg(B) + indeg(P ) − min indeg ExtjR (W, P ) + j .
j

Hence Theorem 3.8 offers other choices of P that could be used to deduce the
linearity of the regularity for high Tor modules in specific situations, or to derive
its value. To emphasize this remark, we recall now what Theorem 3.8 and this fact
says whenever Q is a polynomial ring over a field.
Proposition 3.13. Let Q be a polynomial ring over a field, A := Q/(f ), where
f := f1 , . . . , fc is a homogeneous Q-regular sequence. Let M , N and P be finitely
generated graded A-modules and r ∈ N. If

4. Examples on linearity of regularity

Here we construct an example, which shows that the result in Theorem 3.5
does not necessarily
hold true for higher dimension. In this example, though

reg TorA
i (M, N ) is asymptotically linear in i, but unlike Ext modules, the leading
term of the linear function for Tor depends on the modules M and N .
Example 4.1. Let Q := K[Y, Z, V, W ] be a polynomial ring with usual grading
over a field K, and A := Q/(Y 2 , Z 2 ). Write A = K[y, z, v, w], where y, z, v and w
are the residue classes of Y, Z, V and W respectively. Fix an integer m > 1. Set

and N := A/(y, z). Then, for every i > 1, we have


(i) indeg ExtiA (M, N ) = −i − m + 1 and reg ExtiA (M, N ) = −i.


A
(ii) indeg TorA
i (M, N ) = i and reg Tori (M, N ) = (m + 1)i + (2m − 2).

We postpone the proof of Example 4.1 until the end of this section.

Remark 4.2. In Example 4.1(ii), though reg TorA
i (M, N ) is linear in i, but the
leading term is (m + 1), which can be as large as possible depending on M . In
particular, it shows that the result in Theorem 3.5 is not necessarily true for higher
dimension of TorA
i (M, N ). In the proof of Example 4.1(ii), since dim(Ker(Φi )) = 2,
it follows that dim TorA
i (M, N ) = 2 for all i > 1.
Remark 4.3. In view of Theorem 1.1 and Example 4.1(ii), by comparing the coefficients of i from both sides, we can conclude that the inequalities in Theorem 1.1
do not necessarily hold true for higher dimension of Tor modules.
Remark 4.4. With Setup 4.5, the graded modules

 using Proposition 3.11,
as in Theorem 3.5, one obtains that reg TorA
2i (M, N ) is linear in i with leading
coefficient 2, which is a contradiction because reg TorA
2i (M, N ) = 2(m + 1)i +
(2m − 2).

where On denotes the matrix of order n × (n + 1) with all entries 0.
The following relations of Bn and Cn (n > 1) help us to build minimal free
resolution of M .
Proposition 4.6. With Setup 4.5, for every n > 1, Bn Cn+1 + Cn Bn+1 = 0.
Proof. We use induction on n. It can be verified that B1 C2 + C1 B2 = 0 and
B2 C3 + C2 B3 = 0. Assuming the equality Bp Cp+1 + Cp Bp+1 = 0 for p 6 n, we
verify it for n + 1. We may assume that n is even, say 2q. The case when n is odd
can be treated in a similar way. Note that

We are now able to provide a proof for the example.
Proof of Example 4.1. In view of (4.1) and (4.3), it suffices to study the regularity
of kernel and cokernel of the following maps :
Ct

C

n
n
N (−n + 1)n, Ψn := N (n − 1)n −−→
N (m + n − 1)n+1

for all n > 1. Since N is annihilated by (y, z), we can substitute N with R :=
K[V, W ], and v m , wm in the entries of the matrices Cn with V m , W m respectively.
(i) Since In (Cnt ), the ideal of maximal minors of Cnt , has depth = 2, by the
Hilbert-Burch Theorem (cf. [3, Thm. 1.4.17]), we have a graded minimal R-free
resolution of Coker(Ψn ) :
(4.4)

Ct

π

n
0 −→ R(n − 1)n −−−
→ R(m + n − 1)n+1 −→ Coker(Ψn ) = In (Cnt ) −→ 0,

where π sends the standard basis element ei to (−1)i δi , and δi denotes the n × n
minor of Cnt with the ith row deleted for 1 6 i 6 n + 1. Therefore, for every
n > 1, one obtains that Ker(Ψn ) = 0, indeg(Coker(Ψn )) = −m − n + 1 and
reg(Coker(Ψn )) = −n. Thus it follows from (4.3) that for every n > 1,
indeg(ExtnA (M, N )) = min{indeg(Coker(Ψn )), indeg(Ker(Ψn+1 ))}
= −n − m + 1 and
reg(ExtnA (M, N )) = max{reg(Coker(Ψn )), reg(Ker(Ψn+1 ))} = −n.
(ii) By (4.4), since deg(δi ) = mn, we get an exact sequence of graded R-modules:
t
En :=[−δ1 δ2 ··· (−1)n+1 δn+1 ]
Cn
0 −→ R(n−1)n −−→
R(m+n−1)n+1 −−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−→ R(mn+m+n−1).

Applying HomR (−, R), we obtain a complex

→ R(−m − n + 1)n+1 −−−

which is acyclic, due to Buchsbaum-Eisenbud acyclicity criterion [3, Thm. 1.4.13].
Thus (4.5) is a graded minimal R-free resolution of Coker(Φn ), and Ker(Φn ) ∼
=
R(−mn − m − n + 1).
Hence it follows from (4.1) that for every n > 1,

(4.6)
reg TorA
n (M, N ) = max{reg(Ker(Φn )), reg(Coker(Φn+1 ))}

= (m + 1)n + (2m − 2).
Thus (4.2) and (4.6) yield the assertion (ii).

5. Examples on nonlinearity of regularity


A
The aim of this section is to show that reg TorA
2i (M, N ) and reg Tor2i+1 (M, N )
need not be asymptotically linear in i even over a complete intersection ring A. We
give the following example over a codimension three complete intersection ring in
positive characteristic.
Example 5.1. Let Q := K[X, Y, Z, U, V, W ] be a standard graded polynomial
ring over a field K of characteristic 2, and A := Q/(X 2 , Y 2 , Z 2 ). We write A =
K[x, y, z, u, v, w], where x, y, z, u, v and w are the residue classes of X, Y, Z, U, V
and W respectively. Set

and N := A/(x, y, z).
M := Coker

Then, for every n > 1, we have
(i) indeg (ExtnA (M, N )) = −n and reg (ExtnA (M, N)) = −n.

(ii) indeg TorA
n (M, N ) = n and reg Torn (M, N ) = n + f (n), where

A
Remark 5.2. Example 5.1(ii) shows that reg(TorA
2n (M, N )) and reg(Tor2n+1 (M, N ))
are not asymptotically linear as functions of n. Moreover, one obtains that n + 1 6
f (n) 6 2n for every n > 1, while f (n) = n + 1 if n = 2l+1 − 2, and f (n) = 2n if
n = 2l − 1 for l > 1. Therefore

Furthermore, for any α ∈ (2, 3), by choosing any subsequence nα (l) such that
|nα (l) − ⌊2l /(α − 1)⌋| is bounded for all l > 1,
lim

reg(TorA
nα (l) (M, N ))
nα (l)

l→∞

In particular, nα (l) can be a sequence of even (resp. odd) integers. Thus both
A
{reg(TorA
2n (M, N ))/2n : n > 1} and {reg(Tor2n+1 (M, N ))/2n + 1 : n > 1}

are dense sets in [2, 3].
Before proving the claims in Example 5.1, we need to setup some notations and
provide some preliminary lemmas.
Setup 5.3. Along with the hypotheses of Example 5.1, for every integer n > 1, we

Remark 5.4. With Setup 5.3, Bn Cn+1 + Cn Bn+1 = 0 for every n > 1.
A similar relation holds for En and Fn , which helps us to build minimal free

Proposition 5.5. With Setup 5.3, En Fn+1 + Fn En+1 = 0 for every n > 1.
Proof. For every n > 1, the block matrix multiplication yields that

The origin of the nonlinear behavior of regularity in Example 5.1(ii) rely on the
behavior of coefficient ideals in positive characteristic.
Lemma 5.10. Set R := K[U, V, W ], where char(K) = 2. For every n > 1, let Bn be
the set of all monomials in U, V, W which are the coefficients of (U X +V Y +W Z)n ,

Q
Therefore In = ai =1 I2i . It shows that the minimal number of generators of In is
3|Sn| , a fact that we will not use for the proof.
We now use induction on l. Since reg(R/I1 ) = 0, for l = 0, the assertion holds.
Suppose reg(R/In ) = 3(2l − 1) if 2l 6 n 6 2l+1 − 1 for some l > 0. Since R/In
is Artinian, and the regularity is given by the shifts in the last component of the
R/I
R/I
minimal free resolution F• n , applying the Frobenius map, we get F• 2n . So
(5.7)

reg(R/I2n ) = 2(reg(R/In ) + 3) − 3 = 3(2l+1 − 1) if 2l+1 6 2n 6 2l+2 − 2.

Note that I2n+1 = mI2n , where m = (U, V, W ). Considering the exact sequence
0 −→ I2n /mI2n −→ R/mI2n −→ R/I2n −→ 0,
for every 2l+1 + 1 6 2n + 1 6 2l+2 − 1,
(5.8)

reg(R/I2n+1 ) = max{reg(R/I2n ), reg(I2n /mI2n )}
= max{3(2l+1 − 1), 2n} = 3(2l+1 − 1).

Thus the assertion for l + 1 follows from (5.7) and (5.8).



Using the interpretation of Fn given in 5.9, we now prove the following facts.
Lemma 5.11. Set R := K[U, V, W ], where char(K) = 2. Then the R-linear map
n+1
n+2
F
Φn : R(−n)( 2 ) −−n→ R(−n + 1)( 2 ) has the following properties.
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
(v)

For every n > 1, Coker(Φn ) is an Artinian R-module.
For every n > 1, reg(Coker(Φn )) 6 reg(Coker(Φn+1 )) − 1.
reg(Coker(Φ1 Φ2 · · · Φn )) = 3(2l − 1) if 2l 6 n 6 2l+1 − 1 for some l > 0.
reg(Coker(Φn )) = 2(n − 1) if n = 2l − 1 for some l > 1.
reg(Coker(Φn )) = 2(2l − 1) + n − 1 if 2l 6 n 6 2l+1 − 1 for some l > 0.

Proof. (i) Let I(Fn ) be the ideal of maximal minors of Fn . By construction of Fn ,
n+1 
n+1
n+1
and changing the role of U, V and W , one can see that U ( 2 ) , V ( 2 ) , W ( 2 ) ⊂
I(Fn ). Therefore the assertion follows from the fact that Supp(Coker(Φn )) ⊆
Supp(R/I(Fn )), which is shown in [13, 20.4 and 20.7.a].
(ii) By virtue of (i), reg(Coker(Φn )) is the smallest number r such that Φn is
n+1
n+2
F
surjective on the graded components > r + 1. Set Ψn : R(−1)( 2 ) −−n→ R( 2 ) ,
which is same as Φn but the grading is shifted by n − 1. So reg(Coker(Φn )) =
reg(Coker(Ψn )) + n − 1. It can be derived from

that reg(Coker(Ψn )) 6 reg(Coker(Ψn+1 )), and hence
reg(Coker(Φn )) 6 reg(Coker(Φn+1 )) − 1.
(iii) In view of the diagram (5.5), the composition Φ1 Φ2 · · · Φn can be interpreted
by the map δ n : R[X, Y, Z]n −→ R, where δ = U δX + V δY + W δZ . Therefore
Image(Φ1 Φ2 · · · Φn ) is equal to the coefficient ideal of (U δX + V δY + W δZ )n . Hence
the result follows from Lemma 5.10.

Clearly, R[X, Y, Z]n and An both are free R-modules of same rank with ordered
bases Bn′ and Bn′′ respectively. Consider the R-linear map δ n : An → R[X, Y, Z]n
defined by acting δ n on the basis elements of An , where δ = U δX +V δY +W δZ . Let
Gn be the matrix representation of δ n with respect to the described bases. Thus
we have a commutative diagram

Since n = 2l − 1, the composition δ n+1 : An → R[X, Y, Z]n−1 is a zero map. It

follows that the

1 6 i 6 2 , the matrix Gn can be expressed as
(Gn )(i,j) = ǫ(i,j) U n−ai1 −aj1 V n−ai2 −aj2 W n−ai3 −aj3 ,
where ǫ(i,j) = 1 if U n−ai1 −aj1 V n−ai2 −aj2 W n−ai3 −aj3 ∈ Bn as defined in Lemma 5.10,
and ǫ(i,j) = 0 else. Therefore Gn is a symmetric matrix. Hence

is a complex. Note that the ideal of maximal minors of Fn has depth 3. On the
other hand, choosing the (n + 1) rows and columns of Gn indexed by


X n−i Y i : 0 6 i 6 n

and



X n Y n Z n /X n−j Y j : 0 6 j 6 n

respectively, the corresponding submatrix is antidiagonal with entries W n on the
antidiagonal. Similarly, one may consider suitable minors for U and V . Thus the
ideal In+1 (Gn ) of all (n + 1) minors of Gn contains pure powers of U , V and W . So
depth(In+1 (Gn ), R) = 3. Therefore, by Buchsbaum-Eisenbud acyclicity criterion
[3, Thm. 1.4.13], (5.10) is acyclic. So reg(Coker(Φn )) = 2(n − 1).
(v) Set g(n) := reg(Coker(Φ1 Φ2 · · · Φn )). It follows from (i) that every Φn
is surjective on all high enough graded components. Let n = 2l . Then, by
(iii), g(n) > g(n − 1), which implies that the component [Φ1 Φ2 · · · Φn−1 ]g(n) is
onto, but [Φ1 Φ2 · · · Φn ]g(n) is not onto. Therefore [Φn ]g(n) is not onto, and hence

reg(Coker(Φn )) > g(n) = 3(n − 1) by (iii). Along with this inequality, the statements (ii) and (iv) yield that
3(n − 1) 6 reg(Coker(Φn ))

..
.
6 reg(Coker(Φ2n−1 )) − (n − 1)
= 2(2n − 2) − (n − 1) = 3(n − 1).
Therefore all the above inequalities must be equalities, and it follows that
reg(Coker(Φn )) = 2(2l − 1) + n − 1 if 2l 6 n 6 2l+1 − 1 for some l > 0.

With all the ingredients in Lemma 5.11, we are now able to compute the regularity of Ext and Tor modules in Example 5.1.
Proof of Example 5.1. The expressions for indeg are shown in (5.2) and (5.4). In
view of (5.1) and (5.3), it requires to compute the regularity of kernel and cokernel
of the following maps :

for all n > 1. Since N is annihilated by (x, y, z), we can substitute N with R :=
K[U, V, W ], and the entries u, v, w in the matrices Fn with U, V, W respectively.
(i) By the observations made in 5.9, the complex

is acyclic, and it provides a graded minimal R-free resolution of Coker(Ψn ). Therefore, Ker(Ψn ) = 0 and reg(Coker(Ψn )) = −n for every n > 1. Hence the assertion
follows from (5.3).
(ii) It follows from the Koszul complex of U, V, W over R that regularities of
Coker(Φ1 ) and Ker(Φ1 ) are 0 and 2 respectively. So we need to focus on n > 2. By
virtue of Lemma 5.11(v),
(5.12)

reg(Coker(Φn )) = 2(2l − 1) + n − 1

if 2l 6 n 6 2l+1 − 1.

Thus, for every n > 2, since reg(Coker(Φn )) > n − 1, in view of (5.11),
(5.13)

reg(Coker(Φn )) = max{n − 1, reg(Ker(Φn )) − 2} = reg(Ker(Φn )) − 2.

Therefore (5.12) and (5.13) yield that
(5.14)

reg(Ker(Φn )) = 2(2l − 1) + n + 1 if 2l 6 n 6 2l+1 − 1.

It follows from (5.1), (5.12) and (5.14) that

Hence, computing reg(TorA
1 (M, N )) = 3 separately, the assertion follows.
