Abstract Path gain and effective directional gain in
azimuth in urban canyons from actual rooftop base
station sites are characterized based on a massive data
set of 3000 links on 12 streets in two cities, with over 21
million individual continuous wave power measurements
at 28 GHz using vertically polarized antennas. Large
street-to-street path gain variation is found, with median
street path gain varying over 30 dB at similar distances.
Coverage in the street directly illuminated by a roof edge
antenna is found to suffer an average excess loss of 11 dB
relative to free space at 200 m, with empirical slopeintercept fit model representing the data with 7.1 dB
standard deviation. Offsetting the base antenna 5 m
away from roof edge, as is common in macro cellular
deployments, introduces an additional average loss of 15
dB at 100 m, but this additional loss reduces with
distance. Around the corner loss is well modeled by a
diffraction formula with an empirically obtained
diffraction coefficient. Effective azimuthal gain
degradation due to scatter is limited to 2 dB for 90% of
data, supporting effective use of high gain antennas in
urban street canyons.

I. INTRODUCTION
Large amounts of spectrum available at mm wave
bands promise large communication capacities,
provided adequate link budget can be maintained
despite increased propagation losses. Link budget can
generally be improved both through deploying a dense
cell network and using directional antennas for higher
directional gain. Since the cost of deploying a network
increases with cell site density, it is critical to
determine coverage range from each site to allow

assessment of commercial viability in environments of
interest. Since effective directional antenna gain is
reduced by scattering, it is important to quantify the
achievable directional gain in realistic environments.
Numerous measurement campaigns [1]-[19] and
channel modeling using ray-tracing simulations have
been carried out in the past few years aiming for
fundamental understanding of mm wave propagation
in dense urban environments featuring street canyons.
Uncertainty in predicting average local path gain at
a location is due to both location-location variability
(a.k.a. shadow fading) as well as uncertainty due to
estimation of model parameters, i.e. slope and
intercept, based on data fit. High reliability outage
statistics (e.g., 90% coverage), require hundreds of
links for a particular environment to make sure the
model uncertainty is much less than the RMS spread
in the data. That requires many hundreds of link
measurements, as opposed to dozens. Very extensive
measurements of path gain at 3.35, 8.5, and 15.75 GHz
were reported for a single Tokyo street in [5] using a
base station at 4 m and a terminal at 1.6 and 2.7 m. A
two-ray model with an empirically determined ground
height was found to be effective at modeling path loss
for the 2.7 m terminal while a single-slope model did
well for 1.6 m. Similarly, low-height measurements in
[26] found two-ray was effective for lamppost heights,
while a blockage model was needed for peer-peer
links. While such measurements are very useful in
characterizing peer-peer and lamppost coverage, there
is strong commercial motivation in characterizing
coverage from rooftop macro cellular sites. Two high

base station locations were used in [2] to collect
wideband directional data for 43 terminal locations.
Ultra-wideband measurements [30][31] at 30 and 60
GHz were collected from two street canyons using
dual-polarized horn antennas scanning at steps of 30o,
where the transmitter was placed about 17 m high and
the receiver moved to a dozen locations along the
street for a distance up to 140 m, where both canyons
ended with a building. Such measurements are useful
for an initial survey, but a reliable quantitative model
requires hundreds of locations, as mentioned above.
Around-corner propagation along street canyons is
of special importance for coverage planning and intercell interference management. Various path loss
models have been developed in the literature to
characterize around-corner propagation along urban
street canyons. Traditional urban macro (UMa) NLOS
models with exponent close to 4, such as [20][21], are
designed for scenarios where over-the-top propagation
is dominant. For cases where both terminals are below
average building height, such as in Manhattan street
canyon with wall or lamppost mounted base stations,
around-corner propagation is dominant for NLOS
coverage. For sub-6 GHz frequencies (e.g. 430 MHz
to 4860 MHz in [25]), street canyon NLOS models
with Manhattan grid cell layout [21][22][25] have
been extended to mm wave bands in [9] using ray
tracing simulation over regular street grid, and in
[10][17] using field measurements. In [10] the ITU-R
model [22] was fitted using urban street canyon
measurements from multiple cities in multiple
frequency bands, and the NLOS distance exponent
was found to be around 3 over multiple bands. In [17]
the ITU-R model [25] was fitted using 28 GHz aroundcorner NLOS measurements with two different
distances from the corner, and the path loss exponents
were found to be around 4 in one case and around 11
in the other. A dual-slope model, which is essentially
a simplification of ITU-R model [22][25] has been
adopted in [9] using the LOS path to the corner as
reference distance and the unwrapped route distance in
path loss calculation for NLOS segment.
The principal objective here is to characterize
reliably (with empirical model uncertainty much
smaller than shadow fading uncertainty) mm wave
coverage from macro base stations to same-street
outdoor terminals both for roof-edge and offset from
edge base antennas. This is done to assess
improvement in rate offered by mm wave spectrum
over traditional microwave band cellular coverage in
more limited bandwidth. Our work derives its
conclusions based on over 3000 continuous wave (CW
at 28 GHz) links measured at multiple base locations,
collected from 12 streets in Manhattan, NY and
Valparaíso, Chile. There are in total over 21 million
individual CW power samples. Each link

measurement consisted of over 30 azimuth scans.
Slope-intercept fit represents measured path loss in the
street canyons with a RMS deviation of 7.1 dB.
Median degradation suffered by offsetting the base
antenna from the roof edge, as is often done in
practical installations, is found to be 15 dB at 100 m.
We find high effective directional gains are available
even in the presence of street-induced scatter, with
90% of locations suffering under 2 dB gain reduction.
Path gain for around-corner propagation is well
characterized using a diffraction-based model with
empirically-obtained coefficients. The large data set
allows statement of empirical models with 90%
confidence interval of under 1 dB for path gain and
under 0.5 dB for effective directional gain distribution.
The resulting models are used to predict achievable
rates, which are found to exceed 300 Mbps for 90% of
outdoor locations for 12 sites/sq km with 400 m intersite-distance and 800 MHz bandwidth at 28 GHz.
II. MEASUREMENT DESCRIPTION
A.
Measurement equipment
To maximize link budget and data collection speed,
we constructed a narrowband sounder, transmitting a
28 GHz CW tone at 22 dBm into an omnidirectional
antenna (2 dBi, in Manhattan) or a 55o horn (10 dBi,
in Valparaiso). The signal received by the 10o (24 dBi)
horn, rotating in azimuth to collect signals arriving
from all directions, was amplified by several
adjustable gain low-noise amplifiers (5 dB effective
noise figure), mixed with a local oscillator, resulting
in an IF signal centered at 100 MHz with effective
bandwidth of 20 kHz, whose power was measured and
converted to digital values with a power meter and
stored on a computer. Both horn antennas were
vertically polarized, with cross-pol isolation over 25
dB. The complete receiver, including the data
acquisition computer, was mounted on a rotating
platform allowing a full angular scan at speeds up to
300 rpm. Given the sampling rate of 740 power
samples/sec, at 300 rpm, a power measurement was
captured every 2.5 degrees. This angular sampling is
substantially finer than the 10o beamwidth of the
spinning receive horn.
The system was calibrated in the lab and anechoic
chamber to assure absolute power accuracy of 0.15
dB. The full dynamic range of the receiver (from noise
floor to 1 dB compression point) was found to be 50
dB, extensible to 75 dB using switchable receiver
amplifiers. In combination with removable transmit
attenuators (0 to 40 dB, used at very short ranges),
measurable path loss allowing at least 10 dB SNR
ranged from 61 dB (1 meter in free space) to 137 dB
(e.g. 200 m range with 30 dB excess loss). Measurable
path loss extends to 171 dB with directional antenna

gains. This follows from 32 dBm EIRP, 24 dBi receive
horn gain, 75 dB maximum effective receiver gain
(combined LNA/ mixer) and target receive power of 40 dBm to be 10 dB above the -50 dBm noise floor.
B.
Measurement environment
To emulate canyon coverage from a rooftop base,
the spinning horn receiver was placed at roof edges at
multiple commercial base station (BS) heights (as
shown in Fig. 1a). Measurements were done while
placing the rooftop base in view of the street canyon
as well as base antenna offset away from the edge of
the roof, as in many commercial sites. The transmitter,
either an omnidirectional antenna (in Manhattan) or a
55o horn (in Valparaíso), was placed on a tripod in the
middle of a sidewalk (Fig. 1b). Transmitter placements
included both the street in view of the base receiver
(same-street) as well as around-the-corner cases.
Same-street coverage from lamppost-mounted base
was also assessed.
Over 3000 links were measured for dense urban
macro deployments, corresponding to over 21 million
individual power measurements. Measurements were
done from 8 buildings, covering 12 streets, 8 in
Manhattan and 4 in Valparaíso, with BS height
varying from 15 to 51 m and transmitter-receiver
separation from 35 to 800 m, measured every 3 to 6 m.

Street in Manhattan from a roof edge 18 m high above

C.
Data processing
The azimuthal average of received power over all
angular directions, denoted as 𝑃𝑎𝑙𝑙 , has been shown to
be equivalent to the average omnidirectional power
(see detailed derivation given by equation (1)--(6) in
[23]). We can therefore estimate the effective
omnidirectional path gain 𝑃𝐺 from 𝑃𝑎𝑙𝑙 by subtracting
transmit power PT, nominal transmit antenna gain GT
and nominal elevation gain of the receive antenna
Gelev:
𝑃𝐺 = 10 log10 (𝑃𝑎𝑙𝑙 ) − 𝑃𝑇 − 𝐺𝑇 − 𝐺𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑣 [dB]
Both transmit antenna gain and receive elevation
gain are assumed undegraded by scattering. Such
idealization is justified by the observation that the
transmit antenna azimuth beamwidth (55o for the horn
and 360o for omni) employed in measurements is
wider than the expected angle spread. Similar
justification is made for the elevation gain, since the
elevation angular spread has been reported as being
small in channel models such as 3GPP 38.901 [20].
III. PATH GAIN
Same-street measurements were collected with an
outdoor terminal placed at successive positions along
the street (every 3 to 6 m) in the middle of a sidewalk,
and a (spinning horn) receive antenna either at roof
edge directly illuminating that street or, else, offset by
about 5 m from roof edge. Illustration of the two
scenarios is in Fig. 2.
As the distance between the transmitter and the
receiver increases, the first Fresnel zone radius
increases from a few tens of centimeters to over a
meter at 500 m and beyond. We may have a visual
LOS path between the transmitter and the receiver but
the presence of clutter in the first Fresnel zone can
cause substantial loss. To avoid confusion, we use
“same-street” to label links that would have been in
LOS condition if there were no street clutter, and use
“around-corner” for NLOS links collected from
perpendicular streets where the direct paths are
blocked by buildings.

A.
Same-street coverage from roof edge antenna
A typical measurement consisted of placing the
rotating 10o receive horn (BS) at the edge of a roof of
a building and placing a transmitter (omnidirectional
or a 10 dBi horn manually re-aimed towards the
receiver from each transmitter location) on a tripod 1.5
m high at different ranges along a sidewalk,
mimicking a user equipment (UE). No effort was done
to include or exclude blockage by street clutter, such
as vegetation, vehicles, pedestrians, scaffolding. The
intent is to emulate coverage of street in the presence
of such obstructions. In total 1650 same-street links
were measured on 12 streets (Manhattan and
Valparaíso), and each link recorded power samples for
at least 10 seconds (over 7400 samples). All such path
gain vs. distance results are shown in Fig. 3.

lines about 2 dB apart. This is much smaller than path
gain differences at a fixed range between streets within
each city. It is found that the 3GPP UMa LOS model,
which is very close to the free space prediction, has a
RMS deviation from our data of about 12.3 dB, while
the 3GPP UMa NLOS model has 17 dB RMS
deviation from data as shown in Fig. 3. As can be seen,
these models are, correspondingly stronger/weaker
than data collected here by about 12 dB at 200 m. That
may be due to environment here being different than
environments used to define 3GPP models. All streets
measured here contained clutter (vegetation, vehicles,
etc.) which may be responsible for the excess loss
observed. Yet such losses are not as substantial as
“true” NLOS cases, involving blockage by buildings,
which is what the 3GPP NLOS model is intended for.
The comparison to data fit and 38.901 UMa models is
summarized in Table 1.

Slope-intercept fit to the measured path gain with

In (1) A [dB] is the 1-m intercept, n is the distance
exponent, 𝑑 [m] is the distance, and σ [dB] is the RMS
error. The deviation of measured path gain vs. distance
from the linear fit (1) is found to be distributed within
0.4 dB of a log-normal distribution with the same
standard deviation, for 99% of points.
At 40 m the fit line is close to Friis free space
predictions, but at 200 m there is an excess loss of 11
dB, increasing to 20 dB at 500 m. A fit using a fixed
intercept at 1 m (set to be same as Friis) and adjusting
distance exponent only, results in distance exponent
n= -2.48, with rms deviation of 7.5 dB.
Fitting the path gain measurements in 8 street sets in
Manhattan and 4 in Valparaíso separately results in fit

Also shown in Fig. 3 in red is a ray theory prediction
for a canyon, which includes up to 10 reflections from
the walls as well as from the ground. The canyon walls
were represented as vertical planes, with a relative
dielectric constant of 5, appropriate for concrete. The
ray powers are summed incoherently to produce path
gain prediction that is monotonically decreasing with
distance. The ray theory prediction of average power
is higher than in free space, due to wall and ground
reflections. Ray theory is also seen to predict some 13
dB higher power than fit to observations at 200 m. This
is attributed to unmodelled street clutter, such as
scatter by (generally sparse) trees, lampposts, vehicles
and pedestrians. Such objects are generally difficult to
represent in ray theory, both in terms of availability of
environmental details as well as inapplicability of
simple specular reflection models to scatter from
complex, rough objects. This is in contrast to reported
ray tracing accuracy in [19]. We also note that in [9],
fit to ray tracing calculation in LOS without street
clutter results in higher power than free space
prediction, similar to red curve in Fig. 3, again in
contrast to our measurements. We conclude, based on
this study, that simple ray tracing is inadequate to
represent the data collected here even in the case of a
nominally LOS street canyon.

Distributions of measured path gain for individual
streets are shown in Fig. 4, each measured at regular
intervals at ranges from 30 to 500 m. They are left
unlabeled for clarity. At any fixed range the streetstreet variation is strong, with median gains spanning
-102 to -133 dB. This is possibly a consequence of
differing amounts of vegetation and building heights.

Same-street coverage from rooftop antenna
offset from roof edge
Base station antennas are often deployed away from
roof edge, closer to the middle of the building, to
conceal them from street view based on aesthetic
considerations. Naturally, there is concern that street
coverage is degraded due to roof blockage,
particularly at higher frequencies. To emulate
conditions experienced by base station antennas when
offset from the roof edge, the spinning horn receiver
was placed about 5 meters away from roof edge, as is
common, at a height of 1 m above the roof. This
caused line of sight to be blocked by a parapet to the
terminal locations within 100 m or so, depending on
building height, which varied from 19 to 51 m in these
offset measurements. Measured path gain for all 1277
such links on 9 streets are shown in Fig. 6, together
with a slope-intercept fit (including 90% confidence
intervals):

Figure 5. Comparison of path gain on streets with and
without trees, measured at the same roof-edge site.

Impact of different street environment on measured
path gain is illustrated in Fig. 5, containing
measurements along 7th Ave in Manhattan (which has
practically no trees) and along W 11th Street (with a lot
of trees) measured from the same roof-top at the corner
of these two streets. The data from both streets has
been included in the overall data set shown in Fig. 4.
It may be observed that the path gain on the street with
trees has a far higher distance exponent of -8.1 as
opposed to -2.3 on a street with no trees. This leads to
some 23 dB more loss at 500 m. Notably this is so
despite the absence of leaves during these winter
measurements.

Figure 6. Path gain for base offset from roof edge, at 28
GHz. 1277 links on 9 streets. Different symbol types
indicate different streets.

Fitting the measured path gain by adjusting the
slope-only, with a fixed intercept set for 1m to the Friis
value, results in an exponent of n= -2.80, and rms
deviation of 7.7 dB.
At ranges of less than 100 m, where the offset base
station is blocked from direct view of the street, 25 dB
to 50 dB excess loss relative to free space is observed.
at ranges beyond 100 m, path loss is about 20 dB worse
than free space.
Fit to roof-edge data (from Fig. 3) is also plotted in
Fig. 6 for reference. For ranges under 100 m, offsetting
the antenna about 5 meters away from roof edge
introduces over 15 dB average extra loss. At longer
ranges, the difference is reduced. Since the presumed

degradation mechanism is diffraction loss at the roof
edge, the excess loss becomes smaller at longer ranges
where the diffraction angle is small. At very long
ranges, the terminal is no longer blocked by the roof
edge, despite being offset. In addition, reflections from
nearby buildings provide a possibility of nondiffracted paths.
C.
Same-street coverage from lampposts
To assess same-street coverage from lamppostmounted BS, measurements were collected at 422
links on 3 streets with BS receiver mounted at heights
ranging from 8 to 15 m and terminal Tx on the street.
The resulting path gain values, shown in Fig. 7, are
represented by a slope-intercept fit as:

being around-one-corner, and then possibly NLOS
around-two-corners [9][25]. In those geometry-based
models, it is the “Manhattan distance”, i.e., the
unwrapped distance along the route, that is used in
path loss modeling. This is in contrast to traditional
models where Euclidean distances are used, which
may result in large RMS fitting error (11 dB as
reported in [18]) for street canyon NLOS channels.

Plamppost  A  10n log10 d  N (0,  ),
A  60.4 dB, n  2.42,   5.5 dB

Figure 7. Same-street path gain measured for 422 links
with BS on lamppost (8 to 15 m high), terminal on street.

The fitted model shows the path gain in this
environment suffers about 9 dB more loss than free
space at 200 m. Fitting the lamppost data with an
adjustable distance exponent, while fixing the 1-m
intercept to its free space value, results in an exponent
of n=-2.37, and RMS deviation of 5.5 dB. Using the
rooftop-derived slope-intercept values (1) to represent
lamppost data results in only an increase in RMS
deviation to 6.0 dB, suggesting very similar path gain
behavior for roof-edge and lamppost mounted base
stations in same-street coverage. These lamppost
results have been included in the overall street-bystreet path gain distributions reported in Fig. 4.
D.
Around-the-corner coverage from roof edge
As illustrated in Fig. 8, when both roof-edge Rx and
street-level transmitter are on the same street, they are
in “nominally LOS” conditions with possible blockage
from trees or street fixtures. As one terminal moves
around a corner into a perpendicular street, the
propagation channel changes from same-street to

Figure 8. Around-corner measurements with rotating Rx
(red hex star near bottom) on the roof of a six-story
building, and the 1.5m-high Tx, moving along the same
street (red line) and around-corner (blue, orange, and
green lines).

Based on the success of modeling around-corner
propagation along hallways inside buildings [23], we
propose two theory-inspired empirical models,
namely, a single-slope scattering model [23] where the
corner is treated as a new source, and a single-slope
diffraction model where edge-diffraction around the
corner is assumed to be the dominant mechanism. Let
x be the unwrapped distance between the two
terminals, and without loss of generality assuming one
terminal is fixed, and the other terminal moves away
along the street and then turns into a perpendicular
street. As distance x increases, the propagation channel
changes from same-street to around-corner.
The diffraction model is given by
𝑃 + 10𝑛 log10 (𝑥) ,
1 < 𝑥 < 𝑑𝑐
𝑃𝑑 (𝑥) = { 1
(𝑑
(𝑥
𝑃1 − ∆ + 5𝑛 log10 𝑐 − 𝑑𝑐 )𝑥) , 𝑥 > 𝑑𝑐
(3)
where dc is the distance from the fixed terminal to the
corner, P1 is the intercept at 1 m distance, n is the
common distance exponent before and after the

corner, and   0 is the empirical “corner loss”,
replacing diffraction coefficient used in canonical
edge diffraction models. When fixing n=-2 it is similar
to the corner model in [29].
The scattering model is given by

Ps ( x )  
 P1    10n log10 (d c ( xd c )), x  d c
It is also worthwhile to compare (3) and (4) with the

where n1 and n2 are the distance exponents of beforeand after-the-corner segments, respectively.
We validate those models using measurements
collected in Manhattan. We placed the rotating horn
receiver on the roof of a six-story building located at a
street intersection and moved the omnidirectional
transmitter (mounted on a 1.5 m high tripod) along the
sidewalk of a 30 m wide street. The measurement
routes are illustrated in Fig. 8 where the same-street
route is indicated by a red line and three around-corner
routes in blue, orange, and green, respectively. The
surrounding buildings are of various heights, and the
ones blocking the direct path are from 10 to over 20
story high, much higher than the six-story roof where
the base is placed. A total of 98 same-street links (i.e.
before corner) were collected from 91 to 565 m along
the street. Around-corner links were collected on three
perpendicular streets where the corners are 244 m, 332
m, and 414 m away from the base, and the length of
the NLOS paths extend up to 210 m. The measured
data and the single-slope diffraction model are shown
in Fig. 9 and the fitted parameters of the models are
summarized in Table 2. The measured data and the
fitted models indicate that after turning around a
corner in a Manhattan street canyon, signal drops
about 14 dB after 10 m into the corner, and about 21
dB after 50 m into the corner.
The single-slope diffraction inspired model provides
the best fit, with 3.4 dB RMS error using only two
parameters (slope and corner loss). This suggests that
signal re-spreading from the corner are an important
propagation mechanism in urban Manhattan street
canyons (continuous tall buildings on both sides of
streets with no or thin foliage). The dual-slope model
(5) provides larger fitting error despite the fact that it
uses more parameters (two slopes, corner loss) than
the diffraction model (3). Therefore, a diffraction
formulation is apparently better for around-the-corner
path loss in urban street canyons. The scattering model
(4) has the highest RMS error of 6.6 dB. Allowing
floating intercept will only slightly reduce the RMS
error for diffraction model (3) and dual-slope model

(5), but would substantially reduce the RMS error to
4.1 dB for the scattering model (4).

Note that for both diffraction model and the
scattering model, the corner loss is very small, only 2.2
dB for diffraction model and 0 dB for scattering
model. This is in sharp contrast to indoor corridor
around-corner propagation reported in [23]. This may
also be compared to the theoretical edge diffraction
coefficient, which at large diffraction angles (deep
shadow) is on the order of -42 dB at 28 GHz [28].
Similar findings have been reported in around-street
corner measurements for 400 MHz to 4.8 GHz [29]
where an empirical “scattering coefficient” S2
equivalent to  was obtained through fit to
measurements and found to be much larger than the
theoretical edge diffraction coefficient. This was
attributed to scattering from lampposts and other street
furniture. Thus, this level of environmental detail may
render ray tracing impractical for mm wave bands.

IV. EFFECTIVE DIRECTIONAL GAIN IN AZIMUTH
High antenna gain is essential to compensate for the
high propagation losses in mm/cm wave bands.
However, the potential directional gain degradation
caused by angular spread would make it less effective.
In this section we quantify the azimuth directional gain
degradation experienced by the 10o horn at the base2.
The effective pattern of an antenna, as seen from field
power-angular measurement, is the convolution of its
nominal pattern (as measured in an anechoic chamber)
and the channel angular response (scattering pattern).
Channel angular spread widens the effective antenna
pattern and therefore reduces its effective gain. In all
cases, the azimuthal gain is defined as the ratio of the
maximum power to average power over all angles:
max P( )
(6)
Azimuth gain 
2
1
d P( )
2 0
It was found that in many streets the effective gain
for the roof-edge base generally increased weakly with
distance. The implicit angle spread thus decreases with
distance in street canyons. An example of this is
illustrated by plotting normalized azimuth patterns in
Fig. 10, where the blue pattern, measured at 580 m
range, shows an unambiguous main lobe, some 40 dB
above sidelobes, while the black pattern, measured at
100 m, shows a second lobe about 10 dB below the
main lobe, corresponding to a reflection from a
building close to the roof top receiver.

Distributions of measured azimuth gains in both
roof-edge and offset measurements are plotted in Fig.
11. Colored regions around the roof-edge and offset
cases are 90% confidence intervals [27]. In the roofedge case 90% of observed azimuth gains are within 2
dB of the antenna nominal azimuth gain, a reference
measured in an anechoic chamber. When the base
antenna is offset by 5 m from the roof edge, 90% of
observed azimuth gains are within 4 dB of the nominal
gain. The additional degradation may be due to
scattering from nearby roof structures.
Degradation from the nominal 14.5 dB azimuth gain
observed in Fig. 11 may be used to account for gain
degradation in link budget calculations, as well as to
derive corresponding azimuth angle spread. We note
that the gain degradation found in these channels is
small, implying narrow angle spread and supporting
effectiveness of using high gain base antennas in street
canyons. In contrast, high directional antennas are
ineffective in fully scattering channels where power
versus angle is constant on average, although the
angular spectrum instantiation is subject to directiondependent fading. As a result, modest diversity gains
are achievable by selecting the direction with the
highest power instantiation, as shown in Fig. 11 where
the simulated arrivals from different directions follow
the i.i.d. complex Gaussian distribution, as appropriate
in full scattering. The amplitude of the complex sum
is then Rayleigh distributed. The complex channel
spectrum is convolved with the complex antenna
pattern [23] to generate instantiations of the pattern,
whose gain is computed using (6) and plotted as the
“full scattering” distribution in Fig. 11.

To evaluate coverage in dense urban deployment,
we simulate rates in an idealized urban network with
200 m by 50 m rectangular city blocks and with cells
placed at street corners separated by 400 m along a
street, as illustrated in Fig. 12, where blue stars
indicate base station sites. To provide coverage along
all streets, each site is located at the intersection, with
four cells covering four directions along the streets,
but not all streets contain a base station. We use path
loss formulas presented above for same-street (roofedge) (1) and around-the-corner channels (3).
We focus on the downlink (DL) cell rate assuming
800 MHz bandwidth at 28 GHz band. Each cell,
mounted on the roof of a 20 m high corner building is
assumed to have 28 dBm transmit power and 23 dBi
nominal antenna gain. Each UE is assumed to have 6
dBi antenna gain with noise figure of 9 dB. Path loss
models are from Section III and gain degradation is
computed based on our measurements in Sec. IV. The
base station is assumed to aim towards the UE it is
serving and interference from neighboring cells is
included in SINR calculation. Since UEs are served by
the strongest base, they may benefit from macro
diversity. Rates are computed as the Shannon rate of
the 10th percentile DL SINR with a 3 dB
implementation penalty. The resulting coverage map
is illustrated in Fig. 12.

with bases (blue stars) placed at intersections, separated
400 m along a street, 12 sites/sq km.

The SNR/SINR and rate distributions are shown in
Fig. 13 and Fig. 14, respectively. It may be observed
in Fig. 13 that the SNR is 5 dB higher than SINR for
90% of outdoor locations, indicating an interferencelimited (outdoor) system. The 10 th percentile rate for
400m inter-site-distance (ISD) is 350 Mbps for
outdoor terminals. Higher cell densities of 25 and 50
sites/sq km, not shown here due to space limitation,
were found to have similar rate distributions as 12
sites/sq km shown in Fig. 14. Naturally, actual user
rates are impacted by the cell density as it determines
the degree of sharing of bandwidth among users.
Should a different directional gain degradation model
or around-the-corner path loss model be used, or the
base be offset from roof edge, the results might be
different. Their impact on system performance is an
interesting direction for future work.

VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Over 21 million CW power samples in 3000 links on
12 streets in Manhattan, NY and Valparaíso, Chile
were collected to characterize propagation at 28 GHz
in urban canyons from roof top base stations using a
vertically polarized azimuthally rotating horn antenna
at the base, at ranges up to 800 m.
Slope-intercept fit to same-street path gain data from
roof-edge base is found to have RMS deviation of 7.1
dB. Large statistical significance of the data allowed
for high 90% certainty in fit parameters (+/- 2.7 dB for
1-m intercept and +/- 0.12 for slope).
Standard 3GPP models were found to produce 12 to
17 dB RMS loss relative to our data. Measured path
gain was found to suffer excess loss relative to free
space that increased with distance, reaching 11 dB at
200 m. It was found that standard ray tracing in this
simple same-street scenario overpredicts signal
strength (13 dB at 200 m), probably due to the
omission of difficult-to-model scatter from street
objects, such as vehicles, pedestrians and trees.
Separate fits to subsets of data collected in Manhattan
and Valparaíso were within 2 dB of each other, as were
lamppost to street and roof to street. Offsetting the
base antenna 5 m away from the roof edge, towards
the center of the building led to an additional average
loss of 15 dB at 100 m. Around the corner propagation
is well modeled by a diffraction-based model using an
empirical diffraction coefficient of 2 dB.
90% of measured effective azimuthal base antenna
gains were within 2 dB of nominal, indicating low
angle spread compared to the nominal antenna
beamwidth of 10o.
Simulation of network performance for outdoor
users indicated 90% users have a Shannon rate of 350
Mbps or higher, with 400 m ISD and 12 sites/sq km.
For the simulated site arrangement, the majority of
outdoor locations were not in line of sight to any cell.
Quadrupling site density led to near quadrupling of the
shared user rate, consistent with decreased number of
users per cell.
