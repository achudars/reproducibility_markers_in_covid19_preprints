Abstract
For an edge-colored graph G, we call an edge-cut M of G monochromatic if the
edges of M are colored with a same color. The graph G is called monochromatically disconnected if any two distinct vertices of G are separated by a monochromatic edge-cut. For a connected graph G, the monochromatic disconnection
number, denoted by md(G), of G is the maximum number of colors that are
needed in order to make G monochromatically disconnected. We will show that
almost all graphs have monochromatic disconnection numbers equal to 1. We
also obtain the Nordhaus-Gaddum-type results for md(G).
Keywords: monochromatic edge-cut, monochromatic disconnection number,

Introduction

Let G be a graph and let V (G), E(G) denote the vertex set and the edge set of
G, respectively. Let |G| (also v(G)) denote the number of vertices of G, called the
order of G. If there is no confusion, we use n and m to denote, respectively, the
number of vertices and the number of edges of a graph, throughout this paper. For
v ∈ V (G), let dG (v) denote the degree of v. We call a vertex v a t-degree vertex of
G if dG (v) = t. Let δ(G) and ∆(G) denote the minimum and maximum degree of G,
respectively. Sometimes, we also use ∆ to denote a triangle. We use G to denote the

complement graph of G. Let S and F be a vertex set and an edge set of G, respectively.
G − S is a graph obtained from G by deleting the vertices of S together with the edges
incident with vertices of S. G − F is a graph whose vertex set is V (G) and edge set is
E(G) − F . Let G[S] and G[F ] be the vertex-induced and edge-induced subgraphs of
G, respectively, by S and F . The distance of u, v in G is denoted by dG (u, v). For all
other terminology and notation not defined here we follow Bondy and Murty [2].
Throughout this paper, we use Kn , Kn1 ,n2 and Cn to denote a complete graph, a
complete bipartite graph, a cycle of order n, respectively. Let Kn− be the graph obtained
from Kn by deleting an arbitrary edge. K3 is also called a triangle. We call a cycle C
a t-cycle if |C| = t. We use [r] to denote the set {1, 2, · · · , r} of positive integers.
For a graph G, let Γ : E(G) → [r] be an edge-coloring of G that allows a same color
to be assigned to adjacent edges. For an edge e of G, we use Γ(e) to denote the color
of e. If H is a subgraph of G, we also use Γ(H) to denote the set of colors on edges of
H and use |Γ(H)| to denote the number of colors in Γ(H). An edge-coloring Γ of G is
trivial if |Γ(G)| = 1, otherwise, it is nontrivial.
For two vertices u and v of an edge-colored graph G, a rainbow uv-path is a path of
G between u and v such that the edges on the path are colored pairwise differently,
and G is rainbow connected if any two distinct vertices of G are connected by a rainbow
path. An edge-coloring Γ of G is a rainbow connection coloring if it makes G rainbow
connected. For a connected graph G, the rainbow connection number of G, denoted by
rc(G), is the minimum number of colors that are needed in order to make G rainbow
connected. The notion rainbow connection coloring was introduced by Chartrand et
al. in [6].
An edge-cut of a connected graph G is an edge set F such that G−F is not connected.
For an edge-colored graph G, we call an edge-cut R a rainbow edge-cut if the edges of R
are colored pairwise different. For two vertices u, v of G, a rainbow uv-cut is a rainbow
edge-cut that separates u and v. An edge-colored graph G is rainbow disconnected if
any two vertices of G has a rainbow cut separating them. An edge-coloring of G is a
rainbow disconnection coloring if it makes G rainbow disconnected. For a connected
graph G, the rainbow disconnection number of G, denoted by rd(G), is the minimum
number of colors that are needed in order to make G rainbow disconnected. The notion
rainbow connection coloring was introduced by Chartrand et al. in [5].
Contrary to the concepts for rainbow connection and disconnection, monochromatic
versions of these concepts naturally appeared, as the other extremal. For two vertices
u and v of an edge-colored graph G, a monochromatic uv-path is a uv-path of G
whose edges are colored with a same color, and G is monochromatically connected
if any two distinct vertices of G are connected by a monochromatic path. An edgecoloring Γ of G is a monochromatic connection coloring if it makes G monochromatically
connected. For a connected graph G, the monochromatic connection number of G,
denoted by mc(G), is the maximum number of colors that are needed in order to make
2

G monochromatically connected. The notion monochromatic connection coloring was
introduced by Caro and Yuster in [3].
As a counterpart of the rainbow disconnection coloring and a similar object of the
monochromatic connection coloring, we now introduce the notion of monochromatic
disconnection coloring of a graph. For an edge-colored graph G, we call an edgecut M a monochromatic edge-cut if the edges of M are colored with a same color.
For two vertices u, v of G, a monochromatic uv-cut is a monochromatic edge-cut that
separates u and v. An edge-colored graph G is monochromatically disconnected if
any two vertices of G has a monochromatic cut separating them. An edge-coloring
of G is a monochromatic disconnection coloring (MD-coloring for short) if it makes
G monochromatically disconnected. For a connected graph G, the monochromatic
disconnection number of G, denoted by md(G), is the maximum number of colors that
are needed in order to make G monochromatically disconnected. An extremal MDcoloring of G is an MD-coloring that uses md(G) colors. If H is a subgraph of G and
Γ is an edge-coloring of G, we call Γ an edge-coloring restricted on H.
As we know that there are two ways to study the connectivity of a graph, one
way is by using paths and the other is by using cuts. Both rainbow connection and
monochromatic connection provide ways to study the colored connectivity of graph by
colored paths. However, both rainbow disconnection and monochromatic disconnection
can provide ways to study the colored connectivity of graph by colored cuts. All these
parameters or numbers coming from studying the colored connectivity of a graph should
be regarded as some kinds of chromatic numbers. However, they are different from
classic chromatic numbers. These kinds of chromatic numbers come from colorings
by keeping some global structural properties of a graph, say connectivity; whereas
the classic chromatic numbers come from colorings by keeping some local structural
properties of a graph, say adjacent vertices or edges. So, the employed methods to
study them appear quite different sometimes. Of course, local structural properties
may yield global structural properties, and vice versa. But this is not always the case,
say, local connectedness of a graph cannot guarantee connectedness of the entire graph.
So, many colored versions of connectivity parameters appeared in recent years, and we
refer [14, 13, 15, 11, 10, 16, 9] for surveys.
Let G be a graph that may have parallel edges but no loops. By deleting all parallel
edges but one of them, we obtain a simple spanning subgraph of G, and call it the
underling graph of G. If there are some parallel edges of an edge e = ab, then any
monochromatic ab-cut contains e and its parallel edges. Therefore, the following result
is obvious, which means that we only need to think about simple graphs in the sequel.
Proposition 1.1. Let G′ be the underling graph of a graph G. Then md(G) = md(G′ ).
The following result means that we only need to consider connected graphs in the
sequel.
3

Proposition 1.2. If a simple graph G has t components D1 , · · · , Dt , then md(G) =
P
i∈[t] md(Di ).
Let G and H be two graphs. The union of G and H is the graph G ∪ H with vertex
set V (G) ∪ V (H) and edge set E(G) ∪ E(H). If G and H are vertex-disjoint, then let
G ∨ H denote the join of G and H, which is obtained from G and H by adding an edge
between each vertex of G and every vertex of H.
A block is trivial if it is a cut-edge. If e = uv is an edge of G with dG (v) = 1, we call
e a pendent edge of G and v a pendent vertex of G.

Some basic results

Let G be a graph having at least two blocks. An edge-coloring of G is an MDcoloring if and only if it is also an MD-coloring restricted on each block. Therefore,
the following result is obvious.
Proposition 2.1. If a connected graph G has r blocks B1 , · · · , Br , then md(G) =
P
i∈[r] md(Bi ).
By above proposition, if G is a tree, then md(G) = n − 1.
⌋. Furthermore, if G is a unicycle
Proposition 2.2. If G is a cycle, then md(G) = ⌊ |G|
2
|C|
graph with cycle C, then md(G) = n − ⌈ 2 ⌉.
⌋ if G is a cycle.
Proof. By Proposition 2.1, we only prove that md(G) = ⌊ |G|
2
Let G = C be a cycle. Suppose C = v1 e1 v2 e2 · · · vn−1 en−1 vn en v1 . Let r = ⌊ n2 ⌋. For
i ∈ [r] and j ∈ [n], if j ≡ i (mod r), then color ej by i + 1. It is easy to verify that the
edge-coloring of C is an MD-coloring, and so md(C) ≥ r.
Now we prove md(C) ≤ r. If md(C) ≥ r + 1, there is an MD-coloring Γ of C such
that |Γ(C)| ≥ r + 1. Then there exists a color i of Γ that colors only one edge e of C,
say e = ab. Because the monochromatic ab-cut must contain e and some other edges
of C − e, a contradiction.
Because an MD-coloring of G separates any two vertices by a monochromatic cut, it
also separates any two vertices of a subgraph of G. So the following result is obvious.
Proposition 2.3. Let D be a subgraph of a graph G. If Γ is an MD-coloring of G,
then Γ is also an MD-coloring restricted on D.
T
Lemma 2.4. Let H be the union of graphs H1 , · · · , Hr . If i∈[r] E(Hi ) 6= ∅ and
md(Hi ) = 1 for each i ∈ [r], then md(H) = 1.

4

Proof. We prove by contradiction. Suppose Γ is an MD-coloring of H with |Γ(H)| ≥ 2.
Then there are two edges e1 , e2 of H such that Γ(e1 ) = 1 and Γ(e2 ) = 2. W.l.o.g., let
e1 ∈ E(H1 ) and e2 ∈ E(H2 ). Since Γ is an MD-coloring restricted on H1 (also H2 )
and md(H1 ) = md(H2 ) = 1, all edges of H1 are colored by 1 and all edges of H2 are
colored by 2 under Γ, which contradicts that E(H1 ) ∩ E(H2 ) 6= ∅.
Lemma 2.5. If H is a connected spanning subgraph of G, then md(H) ≥ md(G).
Proof. Let H ′ be a graph obtained from G by deleting an edge e = ab where e is in a
cycle of G. If md(H ′ ) ≤ md(G) + 1, let Γ be an extremal MD-coloring of G. Then Γ
is an MD-coloring that is restricted on H ′ , and this implies that e is the only edge of
G colored by Γ(e). However, e is in a cycle of G, and the monochromatic ab-cut has
at least 2 edges, a contradiction. Therefore, md(H ′ ) ≥ md(G).
If H is a connected proper spanning subgraph of G, H can be obtained from G by
deleting some edges in cycles one by one, consecutively. Therefore, the lemma is true.
Corollary 2.6. For any connected graph G, md(G) ≤ n − 1, and the equality holds if
and only if G is a tree.
Proof. Since each connected graph has a spanning tree T , by Lemma 2.5 we have that
md(G) ≤ md(T ) = n−1 if G is connected. On the other hand, if G is a connected graph
with md(G) = n − 1 but G is not a tree, then G has a connected unicycle spanning
subgraph G′ . By Proposition 2.5 and 2.2, md(G) ≤ md(G′ ) < n − 1, a contradiction.
Lemma 2.7. Let G be a connected graph and v ∈ V (G). If v is neither a pendent
vertex nor a cut-vertex of G, then md(G) ≤ md(G − v).
Proof. The following claim is useful for the proof of this lemma and for other proofs
later.
Claim 2.8. For any MD-coloring Γ′ of G, Γ′ (G) − Γ′ (G − v) = ∅.
Proof. We proceed by contradiction. Let e = vu be an edge of E(G) − E(G − v)
and Γ′ (e) ∈
/ Γ′ (G − v). Since dG (v) ≥ 2, there is another edge incident with v, say
f = vw. Because v is not a cut-vertex, there is a cycle C of G with E(C) − E(G − v) =
{e, f }. Because Γ′ is an MD-coloring restricted on C, there are at least two edges
in the monochromatic uv-cut of C and the monochromatic uv-cut contains e. Since
Γ′ (G) − Γ′ (G − v) 6= ∅, f is in the monochromatic uv-cut, i.e., Γ′ (e) = Γ′ (f ). Then,
there is no monochromatic uw-cut in C, a contradiction.
Let Γ be an extremal MD-coloring of G. Then Γ is an MD-coloring restricted on
G − v. By Claim 2.8, Γ(G) − Γ(G − v) = ∅. Therefore md(G) = |Γ(G)| = |Γ(G − v)| ≤
md(G − v).
5

Theorem 2.9. If G is a 2-connected graph, then md(G) ≤ ⌊ n2 ⌋.
Proof. Let F = {C, P1, · · · , Pt } be an ear-decomposition of G where C is a cycle and
Pi is a path for i ∈ [t]. The proof proceeds by induction on |F |. If |F | = 1, then G is
a cycle, the theorem holds. If |F | = t + 1 ≥ 2, let Γ be an extremal MD-coloring of
G. Then Γ is an MD-coloring restricted on G′ , where G′ is a graph obtained from G
by deleting E(Pt ) and the internal vertices of Pt . By induction, we have
|Γ(G′ )| ≤ md(G′ ) ≤ ⌊

n − |Pt | + 1

Suppose that the ends of Pt are a, b and L is an ab-path of G′ . Then C ′ = L ∪ Pt is a
cycle of G. Because Γ is an MD-coloring restricted on C ′ , the monochromatic ab-cut
contains at least one edge of L and at least one edge of Pt , say e. Therefore, there are
at most |Pt | − 1 edges colored by Γ(G) − Γ(G′ ). Since each color of Γ(G) − Γ(G′ ) colors
at least two edges of Pt − e, then |Γ(G) − Γ(G′ )| ≤ ⌊ |Pt2|−1 ⌋. So,
md(G) = |Γ(G)| = |Γ(G′ )| + |Γ(G) − Γ(G′ )| ≤ ⌊

Graphs with monochromatic disconnection number one

In this section we will consider the monochromatic disconnection numbers for some
special graphs, such as triangular graphs (i.e., graphs with each of its edges in a triangle), complete multipartite graphs, chordal graphs, square graphs and line graphs (the
definitions of the last four graphs are as usual, we omit them). We denote the square
graph and the line graph of a graph G by G2 and L(G), respectively.
For a graph G, we define a relation θ on the edge set E(G) as follows: for two edges e
and f of G, we say that eθf if there exists a sequence of subgraphs G1 , · · · , Gk of G with
md(Gi ) = 1 for any i ∈ [k], such that e ∈ G1 and e′ ∈ Gk , and |V (Gi ) ∩ V (Gi+1 )| ≥ 2
for i ∈ [k − 1]. It is easy to check that θ is symmetric, reflexive and transitive and
therefore an equivalent relation on E(G). We call a graph G a closure if eθe′ for any
two edges e, e′ of E(G).
Lemma 3.1. If a graph G is a closure, then md(G) = 1.
Proof. Suppose md(G) ≥ 2 and Γ is an extremal MD-coloring of G. Then there
exist two edges, say e, e′ , of G, such that Γ(e1 ) 6= Γ(e2 ). Since G is a closure, there
is a sequence of subgraphs G1 , · · · , Gk with md(Gi ) = 1 for any i ∈ [k], such that
e ∈ G1 and e′ ∈ Gk , and Gi and Gi+1 have at least two common vertices, say ai , bi ,
6

for i ∈ [k − 1]. Since all edges of each Gi must be colored with a same color under Γ,
Γ(Gi ) = Γ(Gi−1 ). Otherwise there is no monochromatic ai bi -cut. Therefore, Γ(e) =
Γ(G1 ) = Γ(G2 ) = · · · = Γ(Gk ) = Γ(e′ ), a contradiction. So, md(G) = 1.
Theorem 3.2. If G is one of the following graphs, then md(G) = 1.
1. G = H ∨ v where H is a connected graph and v is an additional vertex;
2. G is a multipartite graph other than K1,n−1 and K2,2 ;
3. G is a 2-connected chordal graph;
4. G = H 2 where H is a connected graph;
5. G = L(H) where H is a connected triangular graph.
Proof. (1) If H = K1 , the result holds. If |H| ≥ 2, let T be a spanning tree of G and u
be a leaf of T . By induction, md((T −u)∨v) = 1. Since V (T ∨v)−V ((T −u)∨v) = {u}
and u is neither a pendent vertex nor a cut vertex of T ∨ v, by Lemma 2.7, md(T ∨ v) ≤
md((T − u) ∨ v). Since T ∨ v is a connected spanning subgraph of H ∨ v, by Lemma
2.5, md(H ∨ v) ≤ md(T ∨ v). Therefore, md(T ∨ v) = 1.
(2) We first show that md(K2,3 ) = 1. Any MD-coloring of C4 can have only
two cases, one is trivial and the other is to assign colors 1, 2 to the four edges of C4
alternately. Let H = K2,3 and the bipartition of H be A = {a, c} and B = {b, d, u}.
If md(H) ≥ 2, there is an MD-coloring Γ of K2,3 with |Γ(H)| ≥ 2. Therefore, at least
one of the three 4-cycles of H has a nontrivial MD-coloring. Let the three 4-cycles of
H be H1 = H[a, b, c, d], H2 = H[a, b, c, u] and H3 = H[a, d, c, u]. By symmetry, suppose
that H1 is colored nontrivially, say Γ(ad) = Γ(bc) = 1 and Γ(ab) = Γ(cd) = 2. Then
Γ is a nontrivial MD-coloring restricted on H2 with Γ(au) = 1 and Γ(cu) = 2. It is
obvious that Γ is not an MD-coloring restricted on H3 , which contradicts that Γ is an
MD-coloring of G. Therefore, md(H) = 1.
Let G be a complete bipartite graph other than K1,n−1 and K2,2 . Suppose that A, B
are the bipartition of G with A = {u, v, a1, · · · , as } and B = {u′ , v ′ , b1 , · · · , bt }. Then
at least one of s, t is not zero. Let Gi = G[u, u′, v, v ′, ai ] and G′j = G[u, u′v, v ′ , bj ] for
T
T
i ∈ [s] and j ∈ [t]. Since each Gi or G′j is K2,3 and i∈[s] E(Gi ) ∩ j∈[t] E(G′j ) =
S
S
S
E(G[u, u′, v, v ′]), by Lemma 2.4 we have md( i∈[s] Gi ∪ j∈[t] G′j ) = 1. Since i∈[s] Gi ∪
S
′
j∈[t] Gj is a connected spanning subgraph of G, then md(G) = 1.

Let G = G1 be a complete r-partite graph with r ≥ 3 and let V = {v1 , · · · , vt } be
one part of G. Let Gi = G − {v1 , · · · , vi−1 } for i ∈ {2, · · · , t}. Then each vi is neither
a pendent vertex nor a cut vertex of Gi , by Lemma 2.7, md(G1 ) ≤ md(G2 ) ≤ · · · ≤
md(Gt ). However, Gt = (G − V ) ∨ vt and G − V is a connected graph, which implies
md(Gt ) = 1. Therefore, md(G) = 1.

7

(3) A simplicial order of a graph H is an enumeration v1 , · · · , vn of its vertices
such that the neighbors of vi in H[{vi , · · · , vn }] induce a complete graph. A graph
is chordal if and only if it has a simplicial order (see Corollary 9.22 on page 273 of
[2]). Suppose that a simplicial order of G is u1 , · · · , un and Gi = G[{ui , · · · , un }] for
i ∈ [n − 2] (then G = G1 ). Let Hi = Gi [NGi (ui )]. Since G is 2-connected, each Hi is
a complete graph other than K1 and thus Gn−1 = G[vn−1 , vn ] is a K2 . Therefore, vi is
neither a pendent vertex nor a cut vertex of Gi for i ∈ [n − 2], and hence by Lemma
2.7, md(Gi ) ≤ md(Gi+1 ). So, md(G) ≤ md(Gn−1 ) = 1.
(4) The result holds for G = K2 . We prove it by induction on |G|. If |G| ≥ 3, let
T be a spanning tree of G and v be a leaf of T . Then T 2 − v = (T − v)2 . Since v is
neither a pendent vertex nor a cut vertex of T 2 , then md(T 2 ) ≤ md((T − v)2 ) = 1.
Since T 2 is a spanning tree of G2 , then md(G2 ) ≤ md(T 2 ). Therefore, md(G2 ) = 1.
(5) Let A, B be two edge-induced subgraphs of G. We define
dG (A, B) = min{dG (u, v) : u ∈ V (A), v ∈ V (B)}.
Because the line graph of a triangular graph is also a triangular graph, we only need
to show that L(G) is a closure, i.e., we need to show that for every two edges l1 , l2 of
L(G), l1 θl2 . For each edge ei of G, we denote the corresponding vertex of L(G) by ui .
We proceed by induction on dL(G) (l1 , l2 ).
If dL(G) (l1 , l2 ) = 0, this implies that l1 and l2 has a common vertex. Let l1 = u1u2
and l2 = u2 u3 . If G[e1 , e2 , e3 ] is a triangle (denote it by ∆) of G, then L(∆) is a triangle
of L(G) containing l1 , l2 , and so l1 θl2 ; if just two edges of e1 , e2 , e3 are in a triangle ∆ of
G, suppose ∆ = G[e1 , e2 , e4 ]. Then G[e2 , e3 , e4 ] is a star (call the star S). Because L(∆)
and L(S) are two triangles of L(G) and they have a common edge u2 u4 , and because
L(∆) contains l1 and L(S) contains l2 , then l1 θl2 ; if none of triangles of G contains at
least two of e1 , e2 , e3 , suppose ∆ = G[e4 , e2 , e5 ] is a triangle of G where e4 is adjacent
to e3 and e5 is adjacent to e1 . Then S1 = G[e1 , e2 , e5 ] and S2 = G[e3 , e2 , e4 ] are two
stars of G. Therefore, L(S1 ), L(∆) and L(S2 ) are three triangles of L(G) such that
L(S1 ), L(∆) have a common edge u2 u5 and L(S2 ), L(∆) have a common edge u2 u4 . So,
l1 θl2 .
If dL(G) (l1 , l2 ) = r > 0, let l1 = u1 u2 and l2 = u3 u4 . Suppose P is a shortest path
of L(G) connecting l1 and l2 . Then |P | = r. W.l.o.g., suppose l3 = u3 u5 is a pendent
edge of P . Then dL(G) (l1 , l3 ) = r − 1 and dL(G) (l2 , l3 ) = 0. By induction, l1 θl3 and l2 θl3 .
Therefore, l1 θl2 .
Remark 1: By Theorem 3.2 (2), md(Kn ) = 1 for n ≥ 2. Let v be a minimum
degree vertex of Kn− (n ≥ 4). Then Kn− − v = Kn−1 . Since v is neither a pendent
vertex nor a cut vertex of Kn− , md(Kn− ) ≤ md(Kn−1 ) = 1, i.e., md(Kn− ) = 1 for n ≥ 4.

As we have seen that a lot of graphs have the monochromatic disconnection number
equal to 1. We may guess that the following result holds and it does hold actually.
Theorem 3.3. For almost all graphs G, md(G) = 1 holds.
Proof. Let G ∼ Gn, 1 , that is, G is a random graph on n vertices chosen by picking
2
each pair of vertices as an edge randomly and independently with probability 12 . Let
Auv be the set of events that u and v have at most 2 common neighbors and A =
S
i
u,v∈V (G) Auv . Let Auv be the set of events that u, v have exactly i common neighbors.
S2
Then Auv = i=0 Aiuv . For a vertex w of V (G) − {u, v}, since
P r[w is a common neighbor of u and v] =

This implies that almost all graphs have property that any two vertices have at least 3
common neighbors. We will complete the proof by showing that md(G) = 1 if a graph
G has the property that every two vertices of G have at least three common neighbors.
For any two edges e = ab and f = uv of G, there is a path P of G such that the
pendent edges of P are e and f . Let e1 = x1 x2 and e2 = x2 x3 be two adjacent edges
of P . Then x1 and x3 have three common neighbors (x2 is one of them) and thus e1
and e2 are in a K2,3 of G. This implies e1 θe2 . By transitivity, eθf . Therefore, G is a
closure, and so md(G) = 1 by Lemma 3.1.

Nordhaus-Gaddum-type results

For a graph parameter, it is always interesting to get the Nordhaus-Gaddum-type
results, see [1] and [4, 7, 8, 12, 17, 18, 19] for more such results on various kinds of
graph parameters. This section is devoted to get the Nordhaus-Gaddum-type results
for our parameter md(G).
For a connected graph G, a vertex v is deletable if G − v is connected. Let B be the
set of blocks of G and S be the set of cut-vertices of G. A block tree of G is a bipartite
graph B(G) with bipartition B and S, and a block B has an edge with a cut-vertex
9

v in B(G) if and only if B contains v. Therefore, every pendent vertex of B(G) is a
block (call it leaf-block).
Because B(G) is a tree, there are at least two leaves in B(G) if G has more than one
block. For a leaf-block B of G, there are |B| − 1 deletable vertices in the block. This
implies that every graph has at least two deletable vertices.
Fact 4.1. If G is a connected simple graph with |G| ≥ 2, then G has at least two
deletable vertices. Furthermore, G has exactly two deletable vertices if and only if G is
a path.
Proof. We only need to deal with the case that G is not a path. If B(G) has at least
three leaves, or B(G) has two leaves with one being nontrivial, then G has at least
three deletable vertices; if B(G) has exactly two trivial leaf-blocks, because G is not a
path, there is a nontrivial block B and B has exactly two cut vertices, then B has at
least |B| − 2 ≥ 1 deletable vertices. Therefore G has at least three deletable vertices.
Because a complete graph Kn can be decomposed into two connected graphs if and
only if n ≥ 4, in this section we always assume n ≥ 4.
Lemma 4.2. Suppose G and G are connected spanning subgraphs of Kn with n ≥ 5.
Then there is a vertex v of Kn such that v is deletable for both G and G.
Proof. If both G and G are 2-connected spanning subgraphs of Kn , then every vertex
is deletable for both G and G. So, we assume that at least one of G1 = G and G2 = G
has cut vertices. Let v be a cut vertex of G1 and let S1 , · · · , Sr be the components of
G1 − v. Then Fi = G1 [v ∪ Si ] is a connected graph. It is obvious that G2 − v contains
a complete r-partite spanning subgraph, denote it by H. W.l.o.g., let e = vu1 be an
edge of G2 and u1 ∈ S1 . We distinguish the following cases to discuss.
Case 1: r = 2 and |S2 | ≥ 2, or r ≥ 3.
By Fact 4.1, there is a deletable vertex u2 of F2 and u2 6= v. Then G1 − u2 is
connected. If r = 2 and |S2 | ≥ 2, because H is a complete bipartite graph with
|S2 | ≥ 2, and vu1 is an edge of G2 with u1 ∈ S1 , then G2 − u2 is connected; if r ≥ 3,
then G2 − u2 is also connected. Therefore, u2 is deletable for both G and G.
Case 2: r = 2 and |S2 | = 1. Let S2 = {u2 }.
If F1 is not a path, by Fact 4.1, F1 has a deletable vertex w different from v and u1 .
Then G1 − w is connected. Because u2 connects to all vertices of S1 and vu1 is not
affected in G2 − w, then G2 − w is also connected. Therefore, w is deletable for both
G and G.
If F1 is a path, then suppose y is a leaf of F1 other than v and x connects y in F1 .
Because n ≥ 5, v is not connected to both x and y in F1 . Therefore, vx and vy are
edges of G2 , both G1 − y and G2 − y are connected. Therefore, y is deletable for both
G and G.

Theorem 4.3. Suppose G and G are connected spanning subgraphs of Kn . Then
md(G) + md(G) ≤ n + 1 for n ≥ 5, and md(G) + md(G) ≥ 2 for n ≥ 8. Furthermore,
the upper bound and the lower bound are sharp.
Proof. Because both G and G are non-empty graphs, then md(G) + md(G) ≥ 2 is
obvious for n ≥ 8. So, we need to show that md(G) + md(G) ≤ n + 1 for n ≥ 5.
If n = 5, there are five cases to consider for the graphs G and G, and all of the five
cases imply that md(G) + md(G) ≤ 6 = n + 1 (see Figure 2).
We proceed by induction on n. The theorem holds for n = 5. If n > 5, by Lemma
4.2 there is a deletable vertex v for both G and G. Let G′ = G − v. Then G′ and G′
are connected subgraphs of Kn−1 . By induction, md(G′ ) + md(G′ ) ≤ n. Let Γ be an
extremal MD-coloring of G.
Because n > 5, at least one of dG (v) and dG (v) is greater than 1 (say dG (v) = r ≥ 2).
Then v is neither a pendent vertex nor a cut vertex of G, and so by Lemma 2.7,
md(G) ≤ md(G′ ). If dG (v) ≥ 2, we also have md(G) ≤ md(G′ ); if dG (v) = 1, then
md(G) = md(G′ ) + 1. Therefore, md(G) + md(G) ≤ md(G′ ) + md(G′ ) + 1 ≤ n + 1.
Now we show that the upper bound is sharp for n ≥ 5. Let Bn be a tree with
|Bn | = n and ∆(Bn ) = n − 2. Then Bn is a graph obtained by joining a pendent edge
−
to one of the vertices of Kn−1
with minimum degree. Since G and G are connected
graphs and md(G) = n − 1, md(G) = 2, then md(Bn ) + md(Bn ) = n + 1.
We now show that the lower bound is sharp for n ≥ 8. Let V (Kn ) = A∪B∪{a, b, u, v}
where both |A|, |B| are greater than 1. Let J be a complete bipartite graph with
bipartition A ∪ {a, u} and B ∪ {b, v}. Then C = J[a, b, u, v] is a C4 . Let G be a graph
obtained from J by deleting the edges of C. Let Ga = J − {b, u, v}, Gb = J − {a, u, v},
Gu = J − {a, b, v} and Gv = J − {a, b, u}. Then G is the union of Ga , Gb , Gu and Gv .
Because Ga , Gb , Gu and Gv are complete bipartite graphs other than K2,2 and stars,
by Theorem 3.2 (2), we have md(Ga ) = md(Gb ) = md(Gu ) = md(Gv ) = 1. Thus, by
Lemma 2.4, md(G) = 1 (see Figure 1). For G, since H1 = G[A∪a∪u], H2 = G[a, b, u, v]
and H3 = G[B ∪ b ∪ v] are complete graphs, and E(Hi ) ∩ E(Hi+1 ) 6= ∅ for i = 1, 2,
md(G) = 1 (see Figure 1). Therefore, the lower bound is sharp for n ≥ 8.

Remark 2: By Theorem 4.3, the lower bound of md(G) + md(G) for 4 ≤ n ≤ 7
and the upper bound of md(G) + md(G) for n = 4 are not considered. We will discuss
them below.

Figure 2: The five cases of G and G we talk about when n = 5.
(II) For n = 5, there are ten cases for G and G. However, by symmetry, we only
need to discuss the five cases depicted in Figure 2. Among all the five cases, (3) implies
that the lower bound of md(G) + md(G) is 4.
(III) For n = 6, e(K6 ) = 15. Because G and G are connected spanning subgraphs
of K6 , both e(G) and e(G) are greater than or equal to 5.
If e(G) = 5 and e(G) = 10, then md(G) + md(G) ≥ 6.
If e(G) = 6 and e(G) = 9, then G is a unicycle graph and the length of the cycle is
at most 6. By Proposition 2.2, we have md(G) ≥ 3. So, md(G) + md(G) ≥ 4.
If e(G) = 7 and e(G) = 8, we assume that G has t blocks. If t ≥ 3, by proposition
2.1 we have md(G) ≥ 3. Thus, md(G) + md(G) ≥ 4. If t = 2, G is isomorphic to one

of the four graphs in Figure 3. Because every graph F in Figure 3 has md(F ) = 3,
then md(G) + md(G) ≥ 4. If t = 1, there are three cases to consider (see Figure
4). As shown in Figure 4, we give an extremal MD-coloring for each graph. Because
the last two cases of Figure 4 imply that md(G) + md(G) = 4, the lower bound of
md(G) + md(G) is 4.
(IV) For n = 7, the lower bound of md(G) + md(G) is 2. In fact, we only need
to construct a graph G (see in Figure 5 (1)) and G (see in Figure 5 (2)) such that
md(G) = md(G) = 1.

by Lemma 2.4 we have md(G1 ∪ G2 ) = 1. Because a is neither a cut vertex nor a
pendent vertex of G, then md(G) ≤ md(G − a) = 1.

G[g, a, f, h, b] just has one trivial MD-coloring. Therefore, md(G) = 1. 

Theorem 4.4. If both G and G are connected and |G| = n ≥ 4, then md(G)·md(G) = 9
for n = 4; 4 ≤ md(G) · md(G) ≤ 9 for n = 5; 3 ≤ md(G) · md(G) = 10 for n = 6 and
1 ≤ md(G) · md(G) ≤ 2(n − 1) for n ≥ 7. Furthermore, the bounds are sharp.
Proof. We first show the upper bounds.
13

If n = 4, then G = G = P3 , and so md(G) · md(G) = 9; if n = 5, then because
md(G) + md(G) = 6, we have md(G) · md(G) ≤ 9. The graphs G and G are shown in
Figure 2 (4), implying that md(G) · md(G) = 9.
We will show the upper bounds for n ≥ 6. The proof proceeds by induction on n.
We will show the inductive base n = 6 and the inductive step n > 6 simultaneously.
Let G and G be connected graphs with n ≥ 6. By Lemma 4.2, there is a vertex v such
that both G − v and G − v are connected.
Case 1. dG (v) ≥ 2 and dG (v) ≥ 2.
Then v is not a pendent vertex or a cut vertex of G and G. By Lemma 2.7, md(G) ≤
md(G−v) and md(G) ≤ md(G−v). Therefore, md(G)·md(G) ≤ md(G−v)·md(G−v).
If n = 6, md(G) · md(G) ≤ 9 < 2(n − 1); if n > 6, by induction on n, md(G) · md(G) ≤
md(G − v) · md(G − v) ≤ 2(n − 2) < 2(n − 1).
Case 2. dG (v) = 1 and dG (v) = n − 2.
Let u be the neighbor of v in G. Then, v connects every vertex of V (G) − {u, v} in
G.
If u is not a cut-vertex of G−v, then G−u = v∨(G−{u, v}) and thus md(G−u) = 1.
Therefore, md(G) = 1.
If G − {u, v} has two components S1 and S2 , then G − u = (v ∨ S1 ) ∪ (v ∨ S2 ). Since
md(v ∨ S1 ) = md(v ∨ S2 ) = 1, then md(G − u) = 2. Since u is not a pendent vertex or
cut vertex of G, by Lemma 2.7, md(G) ≤ md(G − u) ≤ 2.
If G − {u, v} has components S1 , · · · , Sk where k ≥ 3, then let wi be a vertex
connects u in Si for i ∈ [k]. Then md(v ∨ Si ) = 1 for i ∈ [k]. We now show md(G) = 1.
Otherwise, there is an MD-coloring Γ of G with |Γ(G)| ≥ 2. Since u is not a pendent
vertex or a cut vertex of G, by Claim 2.8, Γ(G − u) = Γ(G). Then there are two edges
e1 and e2 of G − u such that Γ(e1 ) 6= Γ(e2 ). Since md(v ∨ Si ) = 1 for i ∈ [k], w.l.o.g.,
let e1 = vw1 and e2 = vw2 , then G[u, v, w1, w2 , w3 ] ∼
= K2,3 . This contradicts that Γ is
an MD-coloring restricted on the subgraph G[u, v, w1, w2 , w3]. Therefore, md(G) = 1.
According to the above, md(G) ≤ 2. Since md(G) ≤ n − 1, then md(G) · md(G) ≤
2(n − 1) for n ≥ 6.
The graphs Bn and Bn defined in the proof of Theorem 4.3 show that md(Bn ) ·
md(Bn ) = 2(n − 1). So, the upper bound is sharp for n ≥ 6.
Now we show the lower bounds.
If n = 4, md(G) · md(G) = 9; if n ≥ 7, since there are graphs G and G such that
md(G) + md(G) = 2, then md(G) · md(G) = 1, i.e., the lower bound is sharp.
If n = 5, md(G) · md(G) is minimum when G and G are graphs shown in Figure 2
(3), which implies that md(G) · md(G) = 4.
If n = 6, since md(G) + md(G) ≥ 4, md(G) · md(G) ≥ 3. Let G be a graph
obtained by connecting an additional vertex w to a vertex u of a 5-cycle (which implies
14

md(G) = 3). Then G is a graph obtained by connecting w to every vertex of C5 except
for u. Then u is neither a pendent vertex nor a cut vertex of G, md(G) ≤ md(G − u).
Since G−{w, u} is a path and G−u = v∨(G−{w, u}), then md(G−u) = 1. Therefore,
md(G) = 1, the lower bound is sharp for n = 6.
For ease of reading, the lower bounds and upper bounds of md(G) · md(G) for n ≥ 4
are summarized in the following table.
