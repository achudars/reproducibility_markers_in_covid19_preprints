Introduction

An Hadamard matrix H is an n by n matrix all of whose entries are +1 or âˆ’1
which satisfies HH t = nIn , where H t is the transpose of H and In is the unit
matrix of order n. It is also known that, if an Hadamard matrix of order n > 1
exists, n must have the value 2 or be divisible by 4. There are several conjectures
associated with Hadamard matrices. The main conjecture concerns its existence.
This states that an Hadamard matrix exists for all multiple order of 4. Another
very important conjecture is the following
Conjecture 1. There is no circulant Hadamard matrix with order 4n, n > 1.
This conjecture is known as Ryser conjecture[1]. The only circulant Hadamard
matrix known is

On the circulant Hadamard conjecture the first significant result was made by
R.J. Turyn [2] using arguments from algebraic number theory. He prove that if a
circulant Hadamard matrix of order n exists then n must be of the form n = 4m2
for some odd integer m which is not a prime-power. Another important result
was obtained by Brualdi in [4]. He shown that no circulant Hadamard matrix is
symmetric. Many other important results about this conjecture can be found in
[5], [6],[7],[8] and [9].

The author considers that to reach the proof of the conjectures related to
Hadamard matrices and in general those related with binary sequences it is important to understand the structure of the binary cube Z4n
2 . For this reason was
shown in [10],[11],[12] the relationship between Hadamard matrices and Schur
ring on the group Z4n
2 . Some concepts that we will use in this paper will be
given. We start with the definition of Schur ring.
Let G be a finite
algebra
Pgroup with identity element e and C[G] the group P
of all formal sums gâˆˆG ag g, ag âˆˆ C, g âˆˆ G. For T âŠ‚ G, the element gâˆˆT g
will be denoted by T . Such an element is also called a simple quantity. The
P
P
âŠ¤
transpose of T = gâˆˆG ag g is defined as T = gâˆˆG ag (g âˆ’1). Let {T0 , T1 , ..., Tr }
be a partition of G and let S be the subspace of C[G] spanned by T1 , T2 , ..., Tr .
We say that S is a Schur ring (S-ring, for short) over G if:
1. T0 = {e},
âŠ¤

2. for each i, there is a j such that Ti = Tj ,
P
3. for each i and j, we have Ti Tj = rk=1 Î»i,j,k Tk , for constants Î»i,j,k âˆˆ C.

The numbers Î»i,j,k are the structure constants of S with respect to the linear
base {T0 , T1 , ..., Tr }. The sets Ti are called the basic sets of the S-ring S. Any
union of them is called an S-sets. Thus, X âŠ† G is an S-set if and only if X âˆˆ S.
The set of all S-set is closed with respect to taking inverse and product. Any
subgroup of G that is an S-set, is called an S-subgroup of G or S-group (For
details, see [14],[15]). A partition {T0 , ..., Tr } of G is called Schur partition or
S-partition if T0 = {e} and if for each i there is some j such that Tiâˆ’1 = {g âˆ’1 :
g âˆˆ Ti } = Tj . It is known that there is a 1-1 correspondence between S-ring over
G and S-partition of G. By using this correspondence, in this paper we will refer
to an S-ring by mean of its S-partition.
Let G be a permutation automorphic subgroup of Aut(Zn2 ) and let S(Zn2 , G)
denote an S-ring on Zn2 . Some S-ring importants in Zn2 are:
1. S(Zn2 , Sn ).
Let Ï‰(X) denote the Hamming weight of X âˆˆ Zn2 . Thus, Ï‰(X) is the
number of + in any binary sequences X of Zn2 . Now let Gn (k) denote the
subset of Zn2 such that Ï‰(X) = k for all X âˆˆ Gn (k), where 0 â‰¤ k â‰¤ n.
We let Ti = Gn (n âˆ’ i). It is straightforward to prove that the partition
S(Zn2 , Sn ) = {Gn (0), ..., Gn (n)} induces an S-partition over Zn2 , where Sn â‰¤
Aut(Zn2 ) is the permutation group on n objects.
2. S(Zn2 , Cn ).
Let C denote the cyclic permutation on the components + and âˆ’ of X in
Zn2 such that
C(X) = C (x0 , x1 , ..., xnâˆ’2 , xnâˆ’1 ) = (x1 , x2 , x3 , ..., x0 ) ,

(1.2)

that is, C(xi ) = x(i+1)(modn) . The permutation C is a generator of cyclic
group Cn = hCi of order n. Let XC = OrbCn X = {C i (X) : C i âˆˆ Cn }.
2

Therefore, Cn defines a partition in equivalent class on Zn2 which is an
S-partition.
3. S(Zn2 , âˆ†n ).
Let Î´a âˆˆ Sn act on X âˆˆ Zn2 by decimation, that is, Î´a (xi ) = xai(modn) for
all xi in X, (a, n) = 1 and let âˆ†n denote the set of this Î´a . The set âˆ†n is
a group of order Ï†(n) isomorphic to Zâˆ—n , the group the units of Zn , where
Ï† is called the Euler totient function. Clearly S(Zn2 , âˆ†n ) is an S-partition
of Zn2 .
4. S(Zn2 , Hn ).
We note by RY the reversed sequence RY = (ynâˆ’1 , ..., y1 , y0) of Y and let
Hn denote the permutation automorphic subgroup Hn = {1, R} â‰¤ Sn â‰¤
Aut(Z2n ). Hence Hn defines a partition on Zn2 and S(Zn2 , Hn ) is a Schur
ring.
In [11] was shown that if there is a circulant Hadamard matrix, then must be
contained in G4m2 (2m2 âˆ’ m). Let Sym(Z4n
2 ) denote the S-subgroup of all sym4n
metric binary sequences in Z2 . By the result of Brualdi, no circulant Hadamard
matrix exists in Sym(Z4n
2 ). As we want circulant matrices, then the search must
n
be do in S(Z2 , Cn ). Finally, in the following section the relationship between of
the Schur ring S(Z4n
2 , âˆ†4n ) and the circulant Hadamard matrices will be shown.
Let A be a alphabet and let Aâˆ— denote all finite words defined on A. Any
subsequence of consequtive letters of a word is a subword. Given a word w =
s1 s2 Â· Â· Â· sn , the number n is called the length of w and we denoted this by |w|. A
subset X âŠ† Aâˆ— is a code if it satisfies the following condiction: For all n, m â‰¥ 1
and x1 , ..., xn , y1, ..., ym âˆˆ X
x1 Â· Â· Â· xn = y1 Â· Â· Â· ym â‡’ n = m and xi = yi for i = 1, 2, ..., n.

(1.3)

In [13] was shown the relationship between S-ring on Zn2 and binary codes. In
particular were used codes for to construct S-subgroups over Zn2 . An important
result obtained is that X = {X, CX, C 2 X, ..., C nâˆ’1 X} is a base for all Zn2 , with
X = âˆ’ + + + Â· Â· Â· + ++. Then we will use this base to construct words that could
be circulant Hadamard matrices. Let YG denote the orbit of some Y in Zn2 under
the action of G. If for a code X it is true that X = YG for some Y in Zn2 , then
we will say that X is a G-code.
This paper is organized as follows. In section 2 some results about Ssubgroups of decimation In (a) in S(Zn2 , âˆ†n ) are obtained. In particular will
be shown that if hai â‰¤ hbi, then In (b) â‰¤ In (a). This theorem is the great importance because say us that we must search circulant Hadamard matrices in In (x)
only if x has order a prime number module n. In the section 3 the conjecture
is proved. First, it is shown that if HC is a circulant Hadamard matrix, then
its orbit under the action of âˆ†4n has order 2, where HC is fixed o reversed by
all decimation in âˆ†4n . Then we take H in I4n (x) with xp â‰¡ 1(mod4n), p a
prime, and we suppose that H either is fixed or is reversed under the action of
Î´2n+x . The idea is to show that H seen as a word has length an even number in
contradiction with the result obtain by Turyn.

Schur ring In (a)

In this section, we will construct âˆ†n -codes for S-subgroups of S(Zn2 , âˆ†n ). We
will use the commutation relation C i Î´a = Î´a C ia for to prove all of results.
Let
(PY (0), PY (1), ..., PY (n âˆ’ 1))
denote the autocorrelation vector of Y in Zn2 , where
PY (k) =

nâˆ’1
X

yi yi+k

i=0

is the periodic autocorrelation function at shift k of Y . Let A(Zn2 ) denote the
set of all autocorrelation vectors and let Î¸ : Zn2 â†’ A(Zn2 ) be the map defined by
Î¸(Y ) = (PY (0), PY (1), . . . , PY (n âˆ’ 1)).
The decimation group âˆ†n do not alter the set of values which PX (k) takes on,
but merely the order in which they appear, i.e., if Y = Î´a X then PY (k) = PX (ka).
Therefore, we have the commutative diagram

and Î¸ â—¦ Î´r = Î´r â—¦ Î¸.
Let Y âˆˆ Zn2 such that Î¸(Y ) = (n, d, d, ..., d). Such a binary sequence is known
as binary sequence with 2-levels autocorrelation value and are important by its
applications on telecommunication. We want to construct a âˆ†n -code for some
S-subgroup H of S(Zn2 , âˆ†n ) containing such Y . From (2.1) is followed that
Î¸(Y ) = Î´a Î¸(Y ) = Î¸(Î´a Y ), for all Î´a âˆˆ âˆ†n . Hence Y and Î´a Y have the same
autocorrelation vector. For Y fulfilling Î´a Y = Y for some Î´a in âˆ†n we have the
following definition
Definition 1. Let a be a unit in Zâˆ—n . A word Y in Zn2 is Î´a -invariant if Î´a Y = Y .
Denote by In (a) the set of these Y .
If Y
all Y, Z
that all
module

is in In (a), then Î´r Y is in In (a), too. Also Î´a (Y Z) = Î´a Y Î´a Z = Y Z for
in In (a). Then In (a) is an S-subgroup of S(Zn2 , âˆ†n ). Now, we shall see
factorization of words in In (a) is relationated with cyclotomic coset of a
n. First, we have the following definition

Definition 2. Let a relative prime to n. The cyclotomic coset of a module n is
defined by
Cs = {s, sa, sa2 , Â· Â· Â· , satâˆ’1 }.
where sat â‰¡ s(modn). A subset {s1 , s2 , . . . , sr } of Zn is called complete set of
representatives of cyclotomic coset of a modulo n if Cs1 ,Cs2 ,..., Csr are distinct
and are a partition of Zn .

Take Y = C i1 XC i2 X Â· Â· Â· C ir X in In (a) with X = âˆ’ + + Â· Â· Â· + +. We want
Î´a Y = Y . Then

a complete set of representative of cyclotomic coset of a module n. As In (a) is
an S-subgroup in S(Zn2 , âˆ†n ), Î´r Csi X = Csj X and
XI(a) = {X, Cs1 X, Cs2 X, ..., Csr X}

(2.2)

âˆ—
is a âˆ†n -code for In (a). Hence XI(a)
has order 2r+1 , where r is the number of
cyclotomic cosets of a module n
The following theorem is fundamental for the proof of the circulant Hadamard
conjecture. This show us the relationship between S-subgroups In (a) and In (b)
when hai and hbi are subgroups from the other. Firstly, we obtain the following

Lemma 1. Take a codeword Cs X in XIn (a) . Then Î´r Cs X = Csrâˆ’1 X for all Î´r in
âˆ†n .

Theorem 1. If hbi is a subgroup of hai, then In (a) âŠ† In (b).
Proof. Let Ca1 and Cb1 denote the classes {1, a, a2 , ..., atâˆ’1 } and {1, b, b2 , ..., bsâˆ’1 }.
By hypothesis hbi â‰¤ hai, then Cb1 âŠ† Ca1 . Hence there exists yi in hai such that
Ca1 = Cb1 âˆª y1 Cb1 âˆª Â· Â· Â· âˆª yk Cb1 ,
and k = [hai : hbi]. As clearly yi Cb1 = Cbyi , then
Ca1 X = Cb1 XCby1 X Â· Â· Â· Cbyk X
and Ca1 X âˆˆ In (b). Now, take Î´r in âˆ†n . Then
Î´r Ca1 X = Î´r (Cb1 XCby1 X Â· Â· Â· Cbyk X)

From Lemma 1 is followed that Carâˆ’1 X is in In (b) for all r âˆˆ Zâˆ—n . Accordingly
In (a) âŠ† In (b).
We will use the above theorem to obtain the following corollaries
Corollary 1. Let a be an unity in Zâˆ—4n of order 2k. Then I4n (a) âŠ‚ I4n (ak ).
Proof. It is enough with to note that {1, ak } is a subgroup of hai.
Corollary 2. Let

a serie of cyclic subgroups of hbi. Then
In (b) âŠ‚ Â· Â· Â· âŠ‚ In (a2 ) âŠ‚ In (a1 ) âŠ‚ In (1) = Zn2 .

(2.4)

Proof. A consequence trivial of Theorem 1.
Finally, we will use the previous results to show some lattice of S-subgroups
I4n (a) in Z4n

As noted, it is sufficient to search for circulant Hadamard matrices in those
S-subgroups I4n (x) such that x has order a prime number.

3

There is no circulant Hadamard matrices in
Z4n
2

In this section the conjecture is proved. Firstly, we show that the orbit of all
circulant Hadamard matrix HC has order 2 under the action of âˆ†4n , where HC
is fixed o reversed by all decimation in âˆ†4n . Then we take H in I4n (x) with
xp â‰¡ 1(mod4n), p a prime, and we suppose that H either is fixed or is reversed
under the action of Î´2n+x . The idea is to show that H seen as a word has length
an even number in contradiction with the result obtain by Turyn. All word in
I4n (x) is factorized in terms of some set of subwords here constructed. A very
useful decimation in our proof will be Î´2n+1 , since Î´2n+1 âˆˆ âˆ†4n for all n â‰¥ 1. We
start with the construction of its associated S-subgroup.
Proposition 1. The S-subgroup I4n (2n + 1) has order 23n .
Proof. As (2n + 1)2 â‰¡ 1 mod 4n, then {1, 2n + 1} is a cyclotomic coset of 2n + 1
module 4n, and
C0 = {0},
C2a = {2a}, 0 â‰¤ a â‰¤ 2n âˆ’ 1,
C2b+1 = {2b + 1, 2n + 2b + 1}, 0 â‰¤ b â‰¤ n âˆ’ 1
are all of cyclotomic cosets of 2n + 1 module 4n. Hence
XI4n (2n+1) = {C0 X, C2a X, C2b+1 X}
and |I4n (2n + 1)| = 23n as we desirable.

(3.1)

A first useful result to show that the orbit of a circulant Hadamard matrix
has order 2 is the following. Here will be shown the relationship between the
decimations Î´x and Î´nâˆ’x and Y when this is either fixed or reversed for those.
Theorem 2. If Î´x YC = RYC for some x âˆˆ Zâˆ—n , x 6= 1, n âˆ’ 1, then Y âˆˆ In (n âˆ’ x).
Proof. Obviously the hypothesis Î´1 YC = RYC is never holded. On the other
hand, if Î´2nâˆ’1 YC = RYC , then Y âˆˆ
/ I2n (2n âˆ’ 1). In this case Y âˆˆ I2n (1) = Z2n
2
trivially. The condiction Î´2n YC = RYC is holds even when Y is contained in
I2n+1 (2n) since I2n+1 (2n) = Sym(Z2n+1
) (see [13], Theorem 14). Then Y âˆˆ
2
I2n+1 (1) trivially. Now suppose x 6= 1, n âˆ’ 1 with Y = C i1 XC i2 X Â· Â· Â· C ir X. As
we want Î´x YC = RYC , then
Î´x YC = (C i1 x XC i2 x X Â· Â· Â· C ir x X)C
âˆ’1

âˆ’1

âˆ’1

and
RYC = (C nâˆ’i1 XC nâˆ’i2 X Â· Â· Â· C nâˆ’ir X)C
implies that ik xâˆ’1 â‰¡ n âˆ’ il (modn) or ik â‰¡ n âˆ’ il x â‰¡ (n âˆ’ x)il (modn). Hence
Y âˆˆ In (n âˆ’ x).
Brualdi[3] proved that if there is a circulant Hadamard matrix, then this is
nonsymmetric. We will use this for to show that a circulant Hadamard matrix
never is fixed by all decimation in âˆ†4n .
T
Theorem 3. Suppose H in xâˆˆZâˆ— I4n (x), then HC is no Hadamard.
4n

Proof. Suppose that HC is Hadamard. Then Î¸(H) = Î¸(RH) = Î¸(Î´x H) for all
x âˆˆ Zâˆ—4n . From the above theorem there is y âˆˆ Zâˆ—4n such that Î´y H = RH.
Therefore RH = H and H is symmetric, but there is no symmetric circulant
Hadamard
matrices. Consequently, if HC is Hadamard then never is contained
T
in xâˆˆZâˆ— I4n (x).
4n

As was already announced we will show that the orbit of a circulant Hadamard
matrix has order 2. We take in mind the three commutation relations among Î´r ,
C and R:
Î´r R = RÎ´r C râˆ’1 ,
RC = C nâˆ’1 R,
C i Î´r = Î´r C ir

(3.2)
(3.3)
(3.4)

Theorem 4. Let HC be a circulant Hadamard matrix of order 4n. Then the
orbit of HC has order 2 under the action of âˆ†4n .
Proof. It was already proven that no circulant Hadamard matrix is fixed under
the action of âˆ†4n . Hence the orbit of HC under the action of âˆ†4n is â‰¥ 2.

Suppose HC in I4nC (x). As Î´x RHC = RÎ´x HC = RHC , then is followed that
RHC âˆˆ I4nC (x). Now, suppose p âˆˆ Zâˆ—4n such that Î´p HC = RHC . Then
Î´p RHC = RÎ´p C pâˆ’1 HC = RÎ´p HC = R2 HC = HC .
Thus Î´p HC = RHC implies that Î´pâˆ’1 HC = RHC . In fact, Î´p and Î´pâˆ’1 belong
to Î´4nâˆ’1 S(HC ), where S(HC ) is the stabilizer of HC in âˆ†4n . Let âˆ†4n /S(HC )
denote the set of cosets {Î´x S(HC )} of S(HC ) in âˆ†4n . We want to show that
[âˆ†4n : S(HC )] = 2. As (Î´a Y )C i (Î´a Y ) = Î´a (Y C ia Y ), then (Î´a Y )C i (Î´a Y ) is
a decimation of Y C ia Y . From the commutation relations above Î´x H = H
implies Î´4nâˆ’x H = C 4nâˆ’1 RH for Î´x âˆˆ S(HC ). Hence Î´x (HC ix H) = HC i H
and Î´4nâˆ’x (HC 4nâˆ’ix H) = RC(HC 4nâˆ’i H) implies Î´x (HC ix H)C = (HC i H)C and
Î´4nâˆ’x (HC 4nâˆ’ix H)C = R(HC 4nâˆ’i H)C , respectively, for Î´x âˆˆ S(HC ). Let YC2 denote the vector
YC2 = (1, (Y CY )C , (Y C 2 Y )C , ..., (Y C nâˆ’1 Y )C )

(3.5)

for any Y âˆˆ Zn2 . As (Y C i Y )C = (Y C nâˆ’i Y )C , then YC2 is in correspondence with
the autocorrelation vector
Î¸(Y ) = (PY (0), PY (1), ..., PY (n âˆ’ 1)),
where PY (k) = n âˆ’ 2|Y C k Y |. Then Î´a Î¸(H) = Î¸(Î´a H) = Î¸(H) = Î¸(RH), for HC
being Hadamard and all Î´a in âˆ†4n , implies that either
Î´a HC2 = (Î´a 1, Î´a (HCH)C , Î´a (HC 2 H)C , ..., Î´a (HC 4nâˆ’1 H)C )
= (1, (HC a H)C , (HC 2a H)C , ..., (HC 4nâˆ’a H)C )
= (1, (HCH)C , (HC 2 H)C , ..., (HC 4nâˆ’1 H)C )
= HC2
âˆ’1

or Î´a HC2 = RHC2 . Thus either Î´a H = H or Î´a H = C 4nâˆ’1 RH. Hence âˆ†4n /S(HC )
has only two cosets, since Î´a is arbitrary. Hence the orbit of HC under âˆ†4n is
{HC , RHC }.
Remark 1. In the proof above neither the length nor orthogonality of HC were
considered, but the autocorrelation vector (4n, 0, ..., 0). By changing that vector
for (n, d, ..., d) we will obtain the following result: Let Y be a binary sequence
with 2-level autocorrelation values. Then the orbit of YC has order â‰¤ 2 under the
action of âˆ†n .
On the other hand, it was already established that In (a) is an S-subgroup in
S(Zn2 , âˆ†n ). Now we will show that C n Y is in I2n (a) for all Y in I2n (a). Thus
the action of C n determines a partition on I2n (a). This it is important because
we can obtain the structure of all word Y in I4n (a) such that Y C 2n Y has length
2n. If we can prove that such Y is not Hadamard, then we will have reached the
proof of the conjecture.
Lemma 2. C n Cs X = Cs+n X with Cs X a codeword in XI2n (a) for all a âˆˆ Zâˆ—2n .
10

Proof. This is easily seen by noting that all x in Zâˆ—2n is an odd number and from
nx â‰¡ n(mod2n). Hence

Now we have the following
Definition 3. We will call to Cs X and Cs+2n X codewords C 2n -complementary
in XI4n (a) . If Cs X = Cs+2n X, then Cs X is a codeword C 2n -invariant.
In the following lemmas we will write all word in I4n (x), xp â‰¡ 1(mod4n), p
prime in term of C 2n -complementary and C 2n -invariant subwords.
Lemma 3. Take x in Zâˆ—4n such that x2 â‰¡ 1(mod4n). Then each word in I4n (x)
can contain the following subwords
C a1 X Â· Â· Â· C ar X, where ai âˆ’ ai+1 6= 2n and ai x â‰¡ ai
C b1 XC b1 +2n X Â· Â· Â· C bs XC bs +2n X, where bi âˆ’ bi+1 6â‰¡ 2n and bi x â‰¡ bi

such that Ar X and Dt X contain no any C 2n -complementary pairs and C 2n (Bs X) =
Bs X, C 2n (Eu X) = Eu X and C 2n (Fv X) = Fv X.
Proof. All cyclotomic cosets of x have order either 1 or 2. Thus the subwords
Ar X and Bs X are formed by cosets of order 1 and the subwords Dt X, Eu X and
Fv X are formed by cosets of order 2. The properties of the subwords follow of
its definition.
Lemma 4. Let xp â‰¡ 1 mod 4n, p prime. All word in I4n (x) contains some of
the following subwords:
Ar X
Bs X
Dt X
Eu X

=

=

C a1 X Â· Â· Â· C at X, where ai x â‰¡ ai ,
C b1 XC b1 +2n X Â· Â· Â· C bt XC bt +2n X where bi x â‰¡ bi ,
Cd1 X Â· Â· Â· Cdr X, where |Cdi X| = p,
Ce1 XCe1 +2n X Â· Â· Â· Ces XCes +2n X, where |Cei X| = p.

Proof. As xi 2n â‰¡ 2n mod 4n, then no codeword in XI4n (x) is C 2n -invariant.
Hence Ar X, Bs X, Dt X and Eu X are the only subwords forming all word in I4n (x).

The following lemma allows us to note the decimation Î´p preserves the structure of any written word with the subwords Ar X, Bs X, Dt X, Eu X and Fv X.
Thus we can to find the structure of the subwords and be able to construct the
desired words
Lemma 5. The action of Î´p conserves the structure of Ar X, Bs X, Dt X, Eu X
and Fv X in I4n (x), xq â‰¡ 1(mod4n), q a number prime.
Proof. Suppose x2 â‰¡ 1(mod4n). We want to show that Î´p Ar X contains no C 2n complementary pairs. We have
C 2n Î´p Ar X = C 2n Î´p (C a1 XC a2 X Â· Â· Â· C ar X)
= C 2n Î´p C a1 XC 2n Î´p C a2 X Â· Â· Â· C 2n Î´p C ar X

then pâˆ’1 (ai âˆ’ aj ) â‰¡ 2n(mod4n). But pâˆ’1 6 |4n and the above is not possible
for any pair (i, j). Hence Î´p Ar X contains no C 2n -complementary pairs and also
2
C 2m Î´p Ar X 6= Î´p Ar X, hence Î´p Ar X is distinct of Bs X. Trivially, Î´p Ar X is
distinct of Dt X, Eu X and Fv X. Equally is proved that

and Fv X. Equally it is shown that Î´p conserves the structure of Bs X, Eu X and
Fv X. The case xq â‰¡ 1(mod4n), q an odd prime is proved equally.
Now we are ready for our proof. We will show that I4nC (x), where xp â‰¡ 1
mod 4n and p is a prime, contains no circulant Hadamard matrices by showing
that neither I4nC (2n + x) nor I4nC (x) \ I4nC (2n + x) contains circulant Hadamard
matrices. We start with the case p an odd prime
Theorem 5. There is no circulant Hadamard matrices in I4nC (x) where xp â‰¡ 1
mod 4n, p an odd prime.
Proof. Let Âµ(4n) denote the number of solution of
x2 â‰¡ 1(mod4n),
12

Q
with n = 2mâˆ’2 di phi i . If exist solution to the equation xp â‰¡ 1 mod 4n with p
an odd prime, then Âµ(4n) < 2Ï†(n). Thus XI4n (x) contains codewords of lenght
1 or p. From Theorem 1, I4n (xy) âŠ‚ I4n (x) for all y such that y 2 â‰¡ 1 mod 4n,
particularly for y = 2n + 1. Thus z = xy = 2n + x. Now take a word Y in I4n (x)
such that is not fixed by âˆ†4n . From Theorem 4, if YC is Hadamard, then either
Î´p YC = YC or Î´p YC = RYC for all p âˆˆ Zâˆ—4n . We will use this and the Lemma 4
and we will show that YC is no Hadamard. We will keep in mind that C 4nâˆ’1 RY ,
C nâˆ’1 RY , C 2nâˆ’1 RY and C 3nâˆ’1 RY are in I4n (x).

In any case |Bs X| = 4s. If i = j, then for n an odd number we have bi = n
for some i. Then Bs X contains the subword C n XC 3n X and |Bs X| = 4s+2.

|Eu X| = 4pu. In the special case i = j we have ei = n for n an odd
number and some i. For the same reasons given above we always have
|Eu X| = 4pu.
Therefore if the subwords Ar X, Bs X, Dt X and Eu X have length an even
number, then YC is no Hadamard. Then we must research the case when Y
contain Ar X with |Ar X| = 2r + 1. The words containing Ar X are
Ar X, Ar XBs X, Ar XDt X, Ar XEu X, Ar XBs XDt X,
Ar XBs XEu X, Ar XDt XEu X, Ar XBs XDt XEu X.

(3.85)

The relation Î´2n+x YC = RYC implies Î´2n+1 YC = RYC . Thus if we want
Î´2n+1 (Ar X)C = R(Ar X)C , Î´2n+1 (Bs X)C = R(Bs X)C , Î´2n+1 (Dt X)C = R(Dt X)C
and Î´2n+1 (Eu X)C = R(Eu X)C with the structure of the subwords already constructed, then the ai , bi , di and ei can not be even number since 2k(2n + 1) â‰¡
2k(mod4n). If Y is some word in (3.85), then |Y | = 2m2 + m. But the latter is
not possible because there are exactly 2m2 odd number in Z4m2 . Hence YC is no
Hadamard. Hence there is no circulant Hadamard matrices in I4nC (x).

Now we will do the proof for the case x having order 2, x 6= 2n + 1
Theorem 6. There is no circulant Hadamard matrices in I4nC (x) where x2 â‰¡
1(mod4n) and x 6= 2n + 1.
Proof. Let Âµ be as the previous theorem. By the Sun Ze Theorem

Âµ(4n) =
2d+2 , if m â‰¥ 3
When we compare Âµ(4n) and Ï†(4n) we have two cases.

Therefore phi 1 âˆ’1 (pi

âˆ’ 1) = 2 for all i. Hence for pi > 2 there is not solution. Now
let n = 2
. Then by the Sun Ze Theorem Âµ(2m ) = 4 and as Ï†(2mQ
) = 2mâˆ’1 , then
m = 3 and the solution corresponds to 4n = 8. Now let n = 2mâˆ’2 di phi i , m â‰¥ 3.
Q

Then Âµ(4n) = 2g+2 and Ï†(4n) = 2mâˆ’1 di=1 phi i âˆ’1 (pi âˆ’ 1). So di=1 phi i âˆ’1 (pi âˆ’ 1) =

must be m â‰¥ 3, then g âˆ’ di=1 ki + 3 â‰¥ 3. It holds that di=1 ki â‰¥ 1. Therefore
the only solution is g = 1, k1 = 1 and m = 3 and corresponds to 4n = 24. By
exhaustive search in I8 (3), I8 (5), I8 (7), I24 (5), I24 (7), I24 (11), I24 (13), I24 (17),
I24 (19) and I24 (23), there is no circulant Hadamard matrices in Z82 and Z24

case Âµ(4n) < Ï†(4n).
Take y = 2n + 1 in Zâˆ—4n . Let z = 2n + x. If YC in I4nC (x) is Hadamard, then
either Î´z YC = YC or Î´z YC = RYC .
case Î´z YC = YC .
This case implies that Î´2nâˆ’x YC = RYC . From Lemma 3, Y has the subwords
Ar X, Bs X, Dt X, Eu X and Fv X. By using a similar argument to previous
theorem it is shown that the length of previous subwords is an even number.
case Î´z YC = RYC .
Equally is obtained that Ar X, Bs X, Dt X, Eu X and Fv X have length an even
number. If some subwords have odd length, then the decimation Î´2n+1 guarantees
us that all word Y is formed by subwords C g X with g an odd number and again
YC is no Hadamard. Hence there is no circulant Hadamard matrices in I4nC (x)
and x 6= 2n + 1.
Finally, we proof for the case x = 2n + 1
Theorem 7. There is no circulant Hadamard matrices in I4nC (2n + 1).
Proof. The proof is done with Î´2n+x and xp â‰¡ 1 mod 4n. From Proposition 1
we consider the subwords
Ar X = C 2a1 XC 2a2 X Â· Â· Â· C 2ar X,
Bs X = C 2b1 XC 2b1 +2n X Â· Â· Â· C 2bs XC 2bs +2n X,
Fv X = C 2f1 +1 XC 2f1 +1+2n X Â· Â· Â· C 2fv +1 XC 2fv +1+2n X
19

From Theorem 5 there is no circulant Hadamard matrices YC with Î´2n+x YC = YC .
So we only have the case Î´2n+x YC = RYC . This implies that Î´x YC = RYC . Thus
we have
1. Î´x (Ar X)C = R(Ar X)C . Then

Suppose that the 2ai are not fixed by x. Thus if the first condiction is
fulfilled, then
2ai â‰¡ (4n âˆ’ 2aj x)(mod4n)
(3.89)
and Ar X contains subwords of the form C2ai XC4nâˆ’2ai X where
C2ai = {2ai , 2ai x, ..., 2ai xpâˆ’1 }
and
C4nâˆ’2ai = {4n âˆ’ 2ai , 4n âˆ’ 2ai x, ..., 4n âˆ’ 2ai xpâˆ’1 }.
But this last implies that Î´x Ar X = Ar X. If the third condiction is fulfilled,
then
2ai â‰¡ (2n âˆ’ 2aj x)(mod4n)
(3.90)
and Ar X contains subwords of the form C2ai XC2nâˆ’2ai X where
C2nâˆ’2ai = {2n âˆ’ 2ai , 2n âˆ’ 2ai x, ..., 2n âˆ’ 2ai xpâˆ’1 }.
And again Î´x Ar X = Ar X. The second and fourth cases are not fulfilled if
n is an odd number.
On the other hand, suppose that some 2ai is fixed by x. Then Ar X contains
either the subwords C 2ai XC 4nâˆ’2ai X or the subwords C 2ai XC 2nâˆ’2ai X. If
all 2ai in Ar X is fixed by x, then Î´x Ar X = Ar X. Conversely, if all no 2ai is
fixed by x, then Î´x Ar X = Ar X too. If in 2ai â‰¡ (4n âˆ’ 2aj )(mod4n) we have
i = j, then 2ai = 2n. Thus if Ar X contains C 2n X and some of the subwords C 2ai XC 4nâˆ’2ai X, C 2ai XC 2nâˆ’2ai X, C2ai XC4nâˆ’2ai X, C2ai XC2nâˆ’2ai X,
then Î´x Ar X = Ar X. Therefore, the only Ar X fulfilled Î´x (Ar X)C =
R(Ar X)C is Ar X = C 2n X.
2. Î´x (Bs X)C = R(Bs X)C . For this cases is proved that Bs X contain the
subwords
C2bi XC4nâˆ’2bi XC2n+2bi XC2nâˆ’2bi X,
C 2bi XC 4nâˆ’2bi XC 2n+2bi XC 2nâˆ’2bi X,
XC 2n X,
Hence |Bs X| is an even number.
20

3. Î´x (Fv X)C = R(Fv X)C . Equally is proved that Fv X contain the subwords
C2fi +1 XC4nâˆ’(2fi +1) XC2n+(2fi +1) XC2nâˆ’(2fi +1) X,
C 2fi +1 XC 4nâˆ’(2fi +1) XC 2n+(2fi +1) XC 2nâˆ’(2fi +1) X.
Hence |Fv X| is an even number.
Therefore the only words that can be Hadamard are
Ar XBs X, Ar XFv X, Ar XBs XFv X.
As |Ar XBs X| < 2m2 + m and |Ar XFv X| < 2m2 + m, then the first possibilities
are ruled out. If Y = Ar XBs XFv X , then
2

|Y C 2m Y | = |Ar XC 2m Ar X|
2

= |XC 2m X|
= 2 < 2m2
for m > 1. Hence there is no circulant Hadamard matrices in I4n (2n + 1),
n > 1.
Finally we will obtain the desired theorem
Theorem 8. There is no circulant Hadamard matrices in Z4n
2 .
Proof. We can subdivide Z4n
2 in three subsets, namely, the subset of symmetric
sequences, the subset the sequences of order 8n and the subset of sequences of
order 8n + 4. Already was shown that there are no circulant Hadamard matrices
in the first two subsets. From Theorems 5, 6 and 7 there is no circulant Hadamard
matrices in I(8n+4)C (x) with xp â‰¡ 1(mod(8n + 4)), p a prime. The Theorem 1
guarantees us that a circulant Hadamard matrix must be searched in I4nC (x)
with xp â‰¡ 1(mod4n), p a prime. Hence there is no circulant Hadamard matrices
in Z4n
2 , for n > 1.

Barker conjecture

Take A = (a0 , a1 , ..., anâˆ’1 ) in Zn2 . Define the aperiodic autocorrelation at shift k
of A to be
nâˆ’k
X
C(k) =

(4.1)
i=1

If |C(k)| â‰¤ 1 for k = 1, ..., n âˆ’ 1, then A is called a Barker sequence of length n.
(For details see [2],[16]) The Barker conjecture asserts that
Conjecture 2. There are no Barker sequences of length n > 13 .
It is known that the circulant Hadamard matrix conjecture implies the Barker
conjecture. Then
Theorem 9. There are no Barker sequences of length n > 13 .
