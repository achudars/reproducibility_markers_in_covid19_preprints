Abstract: In phases where translations are spontaneously broken, new gapless degrees of freedom appear in the low energy spectrum (the phonons). At long wavelengths,
they couple to small fluctuations of the conserved densities of the system. This mixing is captured by new diffusive transport coefficients, as well as qualitatively different
collective modes, such as shear sound modes. We use Gauge/Gravity duality to model
such phases and analytically compute the corresponding diffusivities in terms of data of
the dual background black hole solution. In holographic quantum critical low temperature phases, we show that these diffusivities are governed by universal relaxation of
the phonons into the heat current when the dynamical critical exponent z > 2. Finally,
we compute the spectrum of transverse collective modes and show that their dispersion
relation matches the dispersion relation of the shear sound modes of the hydrodynamic
theory of crystalline solids.

Introduction

One of the most celebrated results originating from Gauge/Gravity duality [1–4] is the
computation of the shear viscosity of the N = 4 super Yang-Mills plasma at infinite
N (N is the rank of the gauge group) and ’t Hooft coupling in terms of the entropy
density of a dual black hole in anti de Sitter spacetime, η = s/4π (in natural units)

–1–

[5]. This was conjectured to place a lower bound on the ratio η/s & 1/4π for stronglycoupled phases of matter [6]. Recalling that the entropy density is proportional to the
area of the bulk black hole, this relation is universal in the sense that the complicated
dependence on the boundary sources is encapsulated as a simple combination of data
defined at the black hole horizon [7].
In a relativistic plasma, which is described at long wavelengths by relativistic hydrodynamics (see [8] for a review of relativistic hydrodynamics), the shear viscosity
controls the diffusion of transverse momentum D⊥ = η/( + p), where  and p are the
energy density and pressure.
At nonzero density, relativistic hydrodynamics predicts the existence of another,
incoherent diffusion constant σ0 , associated to processes without any momentum drag.
This diffusivity can also be computed in terms of horizon data [9–11], as well as the
thermal diffusivity that governs energy diffusion [12].
Taken together, these results point at an interesting link between universal low
energy transport properties (diffusivities) and the dynamics close to black hole horizons.
These results have been extended to less symmetric cases describing inhomogeneous
states, such as the so-called holographic lattices that break translations explicitly with
a periodic potential [13–15]. At long distances, charge and energy diffuse in these inhomogeneous systems [16, 17]. The diffusivities are proportional to the dc thermoelectric
conductivities of the system via Einstein relations, which relates them to horizon data
under very general assumptions [18].
More recent developments have considered the effect of breaking translations spontaneously in one or more spatial directions, which can be implemented either in a
homogeneous1 [19–22] or an inhomogeneous way [23–28]. In either case, the incoherent conductivity and associated diffusivity of the boundary theory can be expressed in
terms of horizon data for thermodynamically stable phases [21, 22, 29, 30]. For thermodynamically unstable phases, the incoherent conductivity also features an integral
over the whole spacetime of some combination of background fields.
The effective theory [31, 32] capturing the low energy dynamics of such states with
spontaneous translation symmetry breaking contains more than the two characteristic
diffusivities just mentioned, due to the presence of additional gapless degrees of freedom
(the Goldstones of spontaneous translation symmetry breaking or in other words, the
phonons) and their mixing with charge and energy fluctuations. The theory of Wigner
crystal (WC) hydrodynamics is succinctly reviewed in section 2 and the diffusivities
we are interested in are presented there. Then, in section 3, we give some details of

our holographic setup. A first objective of this work is to extend previous analyses and
show that all of these diffusivities can be expressed in terms of the background black
hole solution, by a combination of data on the horizon and on the rest of the spacetime.
This is done in section 4, and our main new results are equations (4.18) and (4.19).
Positivity of entropy production in WC hydrodynamics places a bound on a combination of the diffusivities, see equation (2.9). The holographic diffusivities obey this
bound, as we discuss in section 5. Interestingly, this bound can be saturated at low
temperatures. This obtains when the phonons relax into the heat current and leads to
simple relations between the diffusivities. We expect this universal relaxation channel
to be at play in generic states of matter at finite temperature. We give a criterion
for the saturation of this bound as a function of the values of the scaling exponents
characterizing the infra-red fixed point of the system and the irrelevant deformations
away from it. Universal relaxation of phonons into a hydrodynamic operator has also
been recently discussed in the context of the melting of the field-induced Wigner solid
in [33].
In section 6, we conclude with an analysis of the spectrum of the system at
nonzero wavevector by computing the longest-lived pair of transverse quasinormal
modes (QNMs) of the dual black hole. We show that they obey the expected dispersion
relation from WC hydrodynamics. At low wavevector and intermediate temperatures,
there is a pair of shear sound modes, characteristic of the long wavelength dynamics of
solids. However, either at very low or very high temperatures, these modes collide on
the imaginary frequency axis and become pseudo-diffusive, with a purely imaginary gap
controlled by a ratio of thermodynamic data and diffusivities. Both collisions occur in
the hydrodynamic regime and the dispersion relation of the modes is well-captured by
the hydrodynamic dispersion relation, see equation (6.1). These results were originally
presented in [34], but have been moved and expanded upon in the present work for
clarity.
We give a number of technical digressions as well as details of our numeric scheme
in some appendices.

Review of Wigner crystal hydrodynamics

We first recap the main features of two-dimensional isotropic Wigner crystal hydrodynamics. More details can be found in [31, 32]. As translations are broken spontaneously
along both spatial directions, the usual conserved densities (energy, charge, momentum) need to be coupled to two Goldstone modes, ϕi , i = x, y. The free energy is

supplemented by terms capturing the effect of the Goldstones:

f = K|q · ϕq |2 + Gq 2 |ϕq |2 .

(2.1)

K and G are the bulk and shear moduli, and characterize the stiffness of phase fluctuations around the ordered state. It is convenient to parameterize the Goldstones by
their longitudinal and transverse contributions, λk = ∇ · ϕ and λ⊥ = ∇ × ϕ. The
corresponding sources sk,⊥ are defined by requiring that λk,⊥ = δf /δsk,⊥ .
To leading order in gradients and keeping only linear terms, the Goldstones obey
the following ‘Josephson’ relations

where v is the velocity, µ the chemical potential, and γ1,2 and ξk,⊥ are diffusive transport
coefficients.
These equations are supplemented by current, heat and momentum conservation
equations (energy can be traded for entropy to linear order):
∂t ρ + ∇ · j = 0 ,

∂t s + ∇ · (jq /T ) = 0 ,

∂π i + ∇j T ji = 0 ,

The underlying conformal symmetry of the holographic setup implies that the stressenergy tensor is traceless, which sets the bulk viscosity to zero.

with the scalar couplings behaving near the AdS boundary, i.e. in the small φ limit, as
Vuv (φ) = −6 − φ2 + O(φ3 ) ,

Zuv (φ) = 1 + O(φ) ,

Yuv (φ) = φ2 + O(φ3 ) .

(3.2)

The model (3.1) enjoys a global shift symmetry ψI 7→ ψI + cI . In this work, we
will be interested in states that break translations homogeneously [36, 37],3 with
ψI = kxI ,

xI = {x, y} .

(3.3)

This Ansatz breaks the shift symmetry as well as spacetime translations to a diagonal
U(1). As a consequence, the background metric, scalar φ and gauge field only depend
on the holographic radial coordinate,
ds2 = −D(r)dt2 + B(r)dr2 + C(r)(dx2 + dy 2 ),

φ = φ(r),

A = A(r)dt .

(3.4)

t, x, y are the time and space coordinates of the dual field theory. Given (3.2) and (3.3),
the dual boundary theory is deformed by two complex scalar operators ΦI ' φeiψI .
These deformations break translations through the spatial dependence of the phases
ψI .
As explained in [19, 21, 22], whether translations are broken explicitly or spontaneously in the boundary theory depends on the asymptotic behaviour of the scalar
φ near the AdS boundary. For our choice of scalar potential, φ decays towards the
boundary as
φ(r → 0) = λr + φ(v) r2 + O(r3 ) .
(3.5)

See [38] for a recent field theoretic investigation of such states.

–6–

In the usual quantization scheme, λ is the source of the operator dual to the bulk field
φ and φ(v) is related to its vev. If λ = 0, the breaking is spontaneous. If λ 6= 0, it is
explicit. In this work we will only consider the spontaneous case.
The condensation of the order parameter itself (i.e. the phase transition between
the normal and ordered phase) is not captured by the model. This is typically mediated
by an instability towards a spatially modulated, inhomogeneous phase which minimizes
the free energy, [25, 26, 28, 39].4 Instead, the holographic model (3.1) with zero scalar
source λ = 0 directly describes the low energy dynamics of the phonons in the ordered
phase, as we shall demonstrate in the remainder of this work.5 As we show below, the
fluctuations of the bulk fields ψI are dual to the phonons. The bulk global symmetry
should then be understood as encoding the shift symmetry of the NG bosons, not as a
symmetry of the fundamental UV theory.6
Finite temperature, finite density states are modeled by charged black holes in the
bulk, which implies the existence of a regular black hole horizon at r = rh . In the
rest of this work, we use a subscript h to denote quantities evaluated at r = rh . The
temperature T and the entropy density s are given by:

φ = φh + . . . .

We will also be interested in the low temperature behaviour T  µ (where µ is
the chemical potential) of these translation-breaking black holes. More precisely, we
would like to study the interplay between spontaneous translation symmetry breaking
and quantum criticality. To do so, we will assume that the scalar φ has a runaway
behaviour as T → 0 and r → +∞ (or equivalently that the horizon value of the scalar
diverges at low temperature), and that the scalar couplings behave for large φ as
V (φ → ∞) = V0 e−δφ ,

Z(φ → ∞) = Z0 eγφ ,

4

YIR = Y (φ → ∞)eνφ .

(3.8)

This can also be realized in models breaking translations homogeneously [21, 22, 40].
Minimizing the free energy would lead to k = 0, i.e. no breaking of translations at all, [21, 22, 29].
This can be remedied by turning on higher-derivative terms in the action with small couplings [21, 22].

A very similar model was considered in [41] to study holographically spin density waves.

and Hawking-Bekenstein entropy s ∼ ξhθ−2 . Combining both
2−θ
formulæ the entropy density scales as s ∼ T z . More details of these solutions can be
found in [42] or more recently [11]. Here, we simply recall that in general the couplings
appearing in (3.8) are related to the scaling exponents characterizing the solution as
κδ = θ ,

κγ = 4 − θ − 2∆Ao ,

κν = 2∆k − 2 .

(3.10)

The exponents ∆Ao ,k ≤ 0 are the scaling dimension of sources of irrelevant operators
breaking particle/hole symmetry or translations of the IR T = 0 critical solution.
For concreteness, in our numerical calculations we work with
√
√
V (φ) = −6 cosh(φ/ 3) , Z(φ) = exp(−φ/ 3) , Y (φ) = (1 − exp φ)2 .
(3.11)
This implies that the critical solution (3.9) is characterized by θ → −∞, z → +∞,
−θ/z = 1 and ∆Ao ,k = 0. As a consequence, it has a vanishing entropy density s ∼ T .
Our results can easily be generalized to other scalings. The numerical results presented
in this paper are for k/µ = 0.1 and λ = 0.
3.2

Holographic renormalization

Holographic renormalization for the spontaneous case was explained in [21], to which we
refer for details. The salient features are the following. The UV expansion of the fields
ψI are modified compared to that of ordinary massless scalars due to their coupling to
the scalar φ. If φ is not sourced λ = 0, then close to the AdS boundary r → 0
ψI =

ψI,(−1)

r
r

(3.12)

where we have used that the operator dual to φ has dimension ∆ = 2 due to (3.11).
This makes clear that the operators dual to the ψI have the same scaling dimension as
the operator dual to φ and that the whole scalar sector of deformations of the UV CFT
is better understood as complex scalar operators dual to bulk complex scalar fields
ΦI ' φeiψI for small φ (ie close to the AdS boundary). φ and the ψI are respectively

–8–

the modulus and phase of the complex scalar, and inherit its scaling dimension. See
[21] for details. Going back to our background Ansatz (3.3), we see that indeed this
corresponds to spontaneous translation breaking, since the source term ψ(−1) is not
turned on. These powers can be generalized easily to the case ∆ 6= 2 and spatial
dimension d 6= 2.
Near the boundary, the metric and gauge field behave in Fefferman-Graham gauge

AC boundary correlators

The Goldstone modes can be identified by acting on the background with the Lie
derivative along ∂/∂~x . It leaves all fields invariant except the ψI ’s. This confirms that
phonon dynamics are captured by the fluctuations δψI , and by computing the retarded
Green’s functions in the limit ω 6= 0, q = 0, we will verify that they take the expressions
predicted by WC hydrodynamics (2.10), (2.11) and (2.12).
At zero density, we can solve the equations analytically in the low frequency limit
and confirm that we correctly obtain the zero density hydrodynamic correlators (2.12)
in appendix A. At nonzero density, we made this check numerically, and we describe
our numerical methods in appendix B.
The outcome of this analysis is that we identify the boundary phonon and its source
along the direction i = x, y as

is easy to compute the boundary correlators encoded in those bulk fluctuations [45].
This entails numerically solving the relevant equations of motion as we describe in

Shear modulus and shear viscosity

We will now evaluate the shear modulus and the shear viscosity holographically using
the low frequency shear correlator (2.10). The low frequency behavior of the shear
correlator can be computed analytically in a standard way, following [9, 46, 47] (see
[20, 48, 49] for computations of the shear correlator in spontaneous holographic setups,
[50–53] in explicit setups). The equation of motion for the metric perturbation hyx =

Diffusivity matrix from horizon data

In this section, we compute the diffusivities σo , γ1 and ξ in terms of a combination
of horizon and UV-sensitive data through a DC analysis, drawing on previous works
[21, 22, 29, 30, 54, 55]. To that end, we turn on the following DC (linear in time)
perturbation:
δax = a(r) − p1 (r) t ,

δhtx = h1 (r) − p2 (r) t ,

δψx = χ(r) − k tδv.
(4.1)
The mode δv corresponds to a vev, and in fact can be set to zero by a Galilean boost
[29, 30]. It is not fixed by the horizon analysis, and represents the freedom to slide the
system back and forth. Upon turning on relaxation, this mode either becomes a source
[34] or is fixed by the horizon analysis [56].
All time dependence drops out from the linearized equations, provided

In order to compute σ0 , γ1 and ξ we can use the relation between the hydrodynamic
correlators (2.11), (2.12) and the expectations values of the related current densities,
namely:
JA = GAB SB ,
(4.12)
with JA = {j, jq , jϕ }, SA = {Ex /(iω), −∇x T /(iωT ), δsϕ } and where jϕ = ϕ̇ (which
can loosely be thought of as the contribution of the phonons to the electric current
[57]). The boundary electric field and temperature gradients are given by the boundary
behaviour of the bulk fields:
Ex = − lim ∂t (δax (r, t) + µδhtx (r, t)) ,
r→0

(4.13)

By rotating to the basis of currents (jinc ≡ χπjq j − χjπ jq , π), Ē can be understood as
the source of the incoherent current jinc , [21]. The incoherent current is the part of the
electric current which does not drag momentum, [9]. In other terms, χjinc π = 0.
Using (4.2) and (4.4), the electric field and temperature gradient can be expressed
in terms of the sources Ē and δsφ :

where χππ is given by (3.17). We can now form the following linear combination of
currents and relate them to the sources we have turned on using the hydrodynamic
correlators (2.11), (2.12):

where χπjq = χππ − µρ. This follows from jq = π − µj, as required by relativistic
symmetry. Undoing the term δv in δψx with a Galilean boost amounts to shifting the
currents j, jq by terms proportional to δv. These terms can in turn be absorbed by a
redefinition of the velocity v x , which finally gives a contribution to jϕ = −δv, recalling
the Josephson relations (2.2). Substituting (4.10) and (4.11) on the left hand side of
(4.15) and (4.16), we find that

Saturation of entropy bound and universal relaxation

WC hydrodynamics predicts a bound coming from positivity of entropy production
[32],
γ12 ≤ σo X ,

which is obeyed by our DC expressions for the diffusivities:
σ0 X − γ12 =

4πsT 2 Zh

(5.2)

See figure 2.
Interestingly, for our specific choice of holographic model, the bound becomes saturated at low temperatures. Indeed, for the z = +∞, θ = −∞, −θ/z = 1 family we
have mostly focussed on, Zh ∼ 1/T , Yh ∼ T 0 and s ∼ T . Saturation of (5.1) relates the
diffusivities σo , X and γ1 to one another. This is reminiscent of the relation between
second-order transport coefficients of fluid hydrodynamics uncovered in [58]. Magnetohydrodynamics is another example where a bound originating from the positivity of
entropy production [59] is saturated in an explicit holographic realization [60].
To understand this feature, we consider the following Kubo formulæ for the diffu-

The Kubo formulæ (5.3), (5.4) involve the operator ϕ̇, which suggests that a memorymatrix type analysis should apply [33]. Relaxation of the Goldstones into the heat
current provides a particularly appealing and universal mechanism for systems at finite
temperature. It contributes to the low energy Hamiltonian via a term
∆H =

1
χπjq

π · jq .

(5.6)

The full Hamiltonian will contain other contributions from non-hydrodynamic operators. Here we assume these other terms do not dominate at low temperatures. The
contribution from (5.6) to ϕ̇ is
ϕ̇ = i[∆H, ϕ] =

jq
.
χπjq

(5.7)

This equation shows that the time evolution of the Goldstone operator is governed by
the heat current, as advertised. Plugging this in the Kubo formulæ above relates the
diffusivities γ1 , ξ to the thermal diffusivity:

where we have also used (2.7). For the θ = −∞, z = +∞, θ/z = −1 state we have
considered in detail in this work, these expressions capture the correct low temperature
behaviour of the diffusivities (see figure 3), and lead to the saturation of the entropy
bound (5.1). At higher temperatures, other, non-universal relaxation channels will
open. For the θ = −∞, z = +∞, θ/z = −1 holographic state, these non-hydrodynamic
operators also contribute to the Hamiltonian (5.6) but give subleading corrections as
T → 0.8
It is interesting to assess how generic the universal relaxation mechanism we have
just described is. To do so, we consider the more general family of IR end points (3.9).
It is clear that if there is no running scalar φ and the IR is AdS2 ×R2 , the entropy bound
is saturated since all factors in (5.2) scale like T 0 at low temperatures, except of course
for the explicit T 2 factor. When there is a running scalar, there are four classes of IR
end points, characterized by the presence or absence of certain dangerously irrelevant
deformations. These are discussed in some detail in [21, 22, 42] and more recently in
[11], so we will be brief here.
There are two potentially dangerously irrelevant deformations, depending on whether
the bulk fields dual to the conserved current and dual to the phonons support the deep
8

See [61] for another holographic example where momentum relaxation due to explicit translation
symmetry breaking is controlled by the heat current.

– 18 –

IR solution or whether they decay faster than other fields in the bulk. These deformations can be usefully characterized by the scaling dimension of the coupling, which
we denote by ∆Ao and ∆k , respectively. In order for the coupling to source an irrelevant/marginal deformation, ∆Ao ,k ≤ 0. The four classes differ by whether both
deformations are marginal, or only one of them is, or both of them are irrelevant. In
the case we have studied numerically and for which the bound is saturated, both deformations are marginal ∆Ao = ∆k = 0. Their expressions in terms of the action couplings
have been given in (3.10)
Evaluating the right-hand side of (5.2) on the solutions (3.9) together with the
expressions (3.8), (3.10) for the IR couplings and recalling that s ∼ T (d−θ)/z , the entropy
bound is saturated provided
2
(z − 2 + ∆Ao + ∆k ) ≥ 0 .
z
We find that this condition is met provided
z > 2 and θ < 2 and 2 − z < ∆Ao ,k ≤ 0 .

(5.9)

(5.10)

In particular, this implies the bound is never saturated for IR end points with relativistic
symmetry z = 1, which only happens when both deformations are irrelevant. If only
one deformation is irrelevant, then the dimension of the coupling is bounded from
below. If both are marginal ∆Ao ,k = 0, then the bound is saturated if the dynamical
exponent z is large enough, z > 2.
In the parameter space spanned by (5.10), we observe that (2 + z − θ) > −∆Ao ,k .
Recalling that sT ∼ T (2+z−θ)/z at low temperature, this suggests that sT terms can
be neglected at low temperatures in (4.17)-(4.19) against other terms that have a nonvanishing zero temperature limit, such as µρ or k 2 IY .9 Doing so leads to

We have verified that these expressions are consistent with our numerics at low temperature. It is straightforward to check that the expressions (5.11)-(5.13) saturate the
entropy bound (5.1).
9

The irrelevant deformation ∆Ao ,k also source deviations from zero temperature. The inequality (2 + z − θ) > −∆Ao ,k implies that those sourced by sT type terms are less important at low
temperatures.

– 19 –

The prefactors are all temperature independent at low T , so all the low temperature
dependence comes from the common factor in parenthesis. Since this common factor is
the same for all three quantities, the saturation of the bound comes from the cancelation
between the prefactors in the limit of low temperature, rather than from the vanishing
of each individual term in (5.1).
On the other hand, requiring (2 + z − θ) > −∆Ao ,k does not imply that the entropy
bound is saturated. It would be interesting to further investigate these cases and to
understand why the universal mechanism (5.6) is not at play there.

Transverse collective excitations at nonzero wavevector

WC hydrodynamics also predicts the existence of a pair of low energy modes in the
transverse channel. They appear as zeroes of the denominator of the hydrodynamic
retarded Green’s functions and their dispersion relation is:10

On the other hand, for larger values of q > 2 Gχππ /(η − ξ⊥ χππ ), the modes collide on

Observe that while the sign of the q 0 damping term is positive for one of the modes,
this does not lead to an instability since q is large. This collision is captured by the
hydrodynamic dispersion relation, since the inequality on q is true if G is small enough.
We expect G to be small also close to a phase transition between a translationally
ordered and a translationally disordered phase.
We compare the exact location of the quasinormal modes determined numerically
to the hydrodynamic approximation in figure 4 as a function of q/µ, and find they
10

This dispersion relation is strictly speaking valid to order q 2 (6.2), but keeping the expression
(6.1) exact in q derived from first order in gradients WC hydrodynamics leads to a better match to
the numerics.

agree very well, including at very low temperatures. We typically observe deviations
when q & T , which suggests that temperature is the cut-off of the effective description
in terms of WC hydrodynamics, whether T is large or small compared to the chemical
potential µ. This gives strong evidence that the low energy excitations of our system
are well described by WC hydrodynamics at all temperatures, and further confirms
that our holographic model should be interpreted as describing the low energy dynamics of (pseudo)phonons coupled to conserved currents. We emphasize that the same
dispersion relation is valid at both low and high temperature. Similar results on the
low-temperature hydrodynamics of translation-invariant black holes have been reported
in past literature [62–64].
In figure 5, we display the QNMs location as a function of T /µ and compare it to
(6.1). Increasing temperature, the shear sound modes collide on the imaginary axis.
At these temperatures, the shear modulus of the system becomes very small (see figure
1), and this is the underlying reason behind the high temperature pole collision (see
figure 5). The same loss of shear rigidity would occur in a real crystal right before
the phase transition to a liquid phase: the solid would no longer support gapless,

transverse sound modes. The two high temperature branches are well-approximated
by (6.3), with ω+ giving the longest-lived mode. In other words, as the spontaneous
component of the system is becoming very small, the system resembles more and more
a fluid (consistently with the gap of (6.3) being proportional to G, which is going to
zero as T → +∞).
At low temperatures, the QNMs also undergo a collision, which is now driven by
the fact that ξ⊥ ∼ 1/T is becoming very large. Once again, the longest-lived mode is
well-approximated by ω+ in (6.3). The gap is inversely proportional to ξ⊥ and decreases
with T , see figure 6. The system resembles more and more a fluid since the phonons
relax faster (they have a larger diffusivity).
Similar collisions between high temperature, gapped, pseudo-diffusive modes leading to low temperature propagating modes have been reported in previous holographic
literature [65–68]. There are important differences. In our case, translations are broken spontaneously, not explicitly. As a consequence, at the longest distances q → 0,
the modes are always gapless, sound modes. The collision we report is ‘coherent’ or
in other words, can be described by a hydrodynamic effective theory (WC hydrodynamics). In contrast, in [65, 67, 68] the breaking is always explicit and the effective
theory is momentum-relaxed fluid hydrodynamics, and breaks down below a certain
temperature where momentum is no longer approximately long-lived. In [66], translations are broken spontaneously, but the transverse propagating modes are gapped.

– 23 –

Gapless propagating modes are found for a nonzero density of defects, and it would
be interesting if they became gapped at shorter distances, while remaining within the
regime of validity of the hydrodynamic description.
Recently, [69] have also reported similar collisions in a holographic massive gravity
model.

Outlook

The main results we have obtained are as follows. Firstly, we have shown that all of
the diffusivities that characterize the low energy dynamics of a holographic state breaking translations spontaneously can be computed in terms of a combination of horizon
and UV-sensitive data. We have focussed on a specific model breaking translations
homogeneously, and it would be natural to extend this computation to inhomogeneous,
more realistic setups. Moreover, in [21, 22, 29, 30], the incoherent conductivity was
computed for thermodynamically stable phases and solely depends on horizon data.11
We have also shown how the low temperature behaviour of these diffusivities and
the saturation of an entropy bound stemming from Wigner crystal hydrodynamics is
explained by the universal relaxation of the phonons into the heat current. We have
studied whether this depends on the infra-red end point controlling the system at zero
temperature. We found that the entropy bound is not saturated in the presence of
sufficiently irrelevant deformations, or for values of the dynamical exponent 1 ≤ z ≤ 2.
Finally, we have studied the spectrum of transverse collective excitations and discovered that for sufficiently low wavectors the pair of longest-lived modes are well captured by the dispersion relation following from WC hydrodynamics, including at low
temperatures where the system is governed by the IR end point consistent with previous low temperature holographic studies [62–64]. We observed deviations as q & T .
In particular, this means that the hydrodynamic description extends outside of the
regime q  T to q ' T where gradients are of the same order as the thermal scale.
This ‘unreasonable effectiveness’ of hydrodynamics could perhaps be understood along
the lines of the recent work [70].
We have only carried out explicit numerical calculations for the special case z =
−θ = +∞. As we have observed, the saturation of the entropy bound will not occur
for phases with z ≤ 2, in particular for z = 1 in the presence of irrelevant deformations. It was shown in [10, 11] that in these cases new long-lived modes emerge at low
temperature and lead to a breakdown of the hydrodynamic description at earlier times
11

This statement is strictly true for the conductivity associated to the incoherent current defined as
jinc = χπq j − χπj jq . Then, σinc = χ2ππ σo . For other choices of normalization, some overall factors of
χππ appear in the incoherent conductivity.

– 24 –

than that set by temperature. A natural future direction would be to study these cases
with spontaneous translation symmetry breaking.
If translations are explicitly broken, the phonons obtain a mass m and are damped,
with a phase relaxation rate Ω (this phase relaxation rate is of a different microscopic
origin than the phase relaxation rate sourced by the proliferation of topological defects
[71] but appears in the effective theory in exactly the same way). WC hydrodynamics
in the presence of relaxation also predicts a bound on the relaxation parameters [32]

In [34], we showed that turning on a small source for the scalar φ in our holographic
model led to a phase whose low energy effective theory was relaxed WC hydrodynamics, until very low temperatures. The bound (7.1) is also saturating as temperature
decreases, suggesting that the pseudo-phonons also relax universally into the heat current. It would be interesting to understand how this depends on the infra-red end point,
the relaxation mechanism and the details of how translations are broken in the holographic model. By now, many other models of pinned translational order are available
[40, 48, 56, 69, 72–74].
In the presence of a magnetic field, the longitudinal and transverse phonons hybridize into a magnetophonon and a magnetoplasmon [75]. For strong magnetic fields
and in the presence of disorder, the magnetophonon is weakly gapped and a hydrodynamic theory can be formulated [33], which appears to fit well some of the data
on two-dimensional electron systems. Universal relaxation of the magnetophonon into
the electric current may dominate (compared to dislocation-mediated melting) in more
disordered samples, and it would be interesting to study this holographically (see [76]
for a recent study of plasmonic response at zero field in the holographic model studied
here).

AC boundary correlators at zero density

First, we need to figure out how to extract the retarded Green’s functions (2.12) from
the asymptotic data. The relevant part of the renormalized on-shell action at quadratic

Numerics

In this appendix we describe how we construct the numerical solutions of the holographic model (3.1) relevant for the analysis presented in the main text.
B.1

Black hole geometries

The action (3.1) admits black hole solutions asymptotic to AdS which realize holographically the (pseudo-)spontaneous breaking of translations. In order to find those
geometries we take the following Ansatz for the metric and matter fields

The resulting equations of motion can be reduced to a system of four ordinary
differential equations (three are second order and one is first order). For the potentials
in eq. (3.11) it is easy to find the following UV asymptotic solution:

where higher order coefficients are functions of λ, v, ρ, and u3 . This is not the most
general asymptotic solution, but that with AdS asymptotics.
In the IR one can find the following near-horizon solution
φ(r) = φh + O(rh − r) ,

At (r) = Ah,1 (rh − r) + O((rh − r)2 ) ,

u(r) = uh,1 (rh − r) + O((rh − r)3 ) ,

c(r) = ch + ch,1 (rh − r) + O((rh − r)2 ) , (B.4b)

(B.5)

determines the temperature of the black hole T = −uh,1 /(4π), and further higher order
coefficients in (B.4) are also determined in terms of φh , Ah,1 , ch , and ch,1 .
It is easy to check that the equations of motion enjoy the scale invariance (t, x, y, r) →
α (t, x, y, r), At → At /α, k → k/α which we use to set the horizon radius rh = 1 in
our numerical computations. Next we generate numerical solutions by integrating the
equations of motion from the IR (r = 1) to the UV (r = 0). However, a generic
solution obtained this way will not have the UV asymptotics (B.3). In particular
c(r) = c0 + c1 r + . . . , and one would need to shoot for c0 = 1, and c1 = 0 to get the
AdS asymptotics (B.3). But one can make use of a further invariance of the equations
under (x, y) → β (x, y), k → k/β, c → c/β 2 to get c0 = 1. This in practice means that
ch is fixed and we are thus left with three IR parameters φh , Ah,1 , ch,1 ; and one UV
condition: c1 = 0. Therefore, we expect to obtain a two-parameter family of solutions.
We can choose those parameters to be the dimensionless ratios T /µ and λ/µ.
In this work we are interested in solutions breaking translations spontaneously.
These are geometries where λ/µ vanishes but v/µ2 does not (solutions with a nontrivial
φ that behaves asymptotically as φ ∼ v r2 + . . . ). As was shown in [21], for the choice
of potentials (3.11) these solutions exist for any value of T /µ. In the following we will
only consider geometries with λ/µ = 0.
B.2

AC Fluctuations

In order to compute the boundary correlators analyzed in section 3.3 we consider the
following consistent set of fluctuations
δgtx = h(r) e−iωt ,

δAx = a(r) e−iωt ,

δψx = ξ(r) e−iωt .

(B.6)

It is easy to check that at linear order in the fluctuations, the equations of motion for a,
h, and ξ are a consistent set formed by two second order and one first order differential
equation.

– 29 –

For a spontaneous background geometry (where λ = 0) the asymptotic UV solution
for the fluctuations at hand takes the form

(B.7a)
h(r) = r−2 h0 + O(r3 ) ,
a(r) = a0 + a1 r + O(r2 ) ,

(B.7b)

ξ(r) = ξ−1 /r + ξ0 + O(r) ,

(B.7c)

where higher order coefficients are functions of h0 , a0 , a1 , ξ−1 and ξ0 . We shall also
write down here the solution for the order r3 contribution to h(r) since it will be used
below in the computation of the holographic Green functions:

s = (h0 , a0 , ξ−1 ) ,

v = (h3 , a1 , ξ0 ) .

(B.14)

Therefore, rewriting the quadratic on-shell action (3.19) in the gauge (B.1,B.6) one gets

two free IR parameters (ah , ξh ) which allow us to construct two independent numerical
solutions by shooting from the IR. A third independent solution is given by (B.11) and
determines the third column in both matrices above.
B.3

Transverse fluctuations

In section 6 we studied the transverse collective excitations of the system at nonzero
wavevector. In order to compute numerically the corresponding QNMs we need to
study the set of fluctuations
δgtx = h(r) e−iωt+qy ,

δgxy = g(r) e−iωt+qy ,

δAx = a(r) e−iωt+qy ,

δψx = ξ(r) e−iωt+qy .
(B.17)

It is easy to check that at linear order in these fluctuations, the equations of motion are
a consistent set of one first order and three second order ordinary differential equations.
In a black hole background with λ = 0 the asymptotic solutions for h(r), a(r), and ξ(r)
have the same form as in eq. (B.7) above, while for g(r) one gets

g(r) = r−2 g0 + O(r2 ) .
(B.18)
Towards the black hole horizon the solution for the ingoing fluctuations also takes
the same form as in Sec. B.2, namely eq. (B.9), with the addition of
i uω

g(r) e

h,1

Now, to compute the QNMs in this sector we will follow [45] and employ the socalled determinant method. Hence we need to obtain four independent solutions for
the fluctuations, and construct the following matrix of sources
 (I) (II) (III)

Finally, the QNMs, namely the complex frequencies where the holographic Green functions have a pole, are given by the values of ω for which the determinant of the matrix
(B.20) vanishes [45].
