Abstract: Quantum chaos is presented as a paradigm of information processing by dynamical systems
at the bottom of the range of phase-space scales. Starting with a brief review of classical chaos as
entropy flow from micro- to macro-scales, I argue that quantum chaos came as an indispensable
rectification, removing inconsistencies related to entropy in classical chaos: Bottom-up information
currents require an inexhaustible entropy production and a diverging information density in phase
space, reminiscent of Gibbs’ paradox in Statistical Mechanics. It is shown how a mere discretization of
the state space of classical models already entails phenomena similar to hallmarks of quantum
chaos, and how the unitary time evolution in a closed system directly implies the “quantum
death?? of classical chaos. As complementary evidence, I discuss quantum chaos under continuous
measurement. Here, the two-way exchange of information with a macroscopic apparatus opens an
inexhaustible source of entropy and lifts the limitations implied by unitary quantum dynamics in
closed systems. The infiltration of fresh entropy restores permanent chaotic dynamics in observed
quantum systems. Could other instances of stochasticity in quantum mechanics be interpreted in
a similar guise? Where observed quantum systems generate randomness, that is, produce entropy
without discernible source, could it have infiltrated from the macroscopic meter? This speculation is
worked out for the case of spin measurement.

1. Introduction
With the advent of the first publications proposing the concept of deterministic chaos and
substantiating it with a novel tool, computer simulations, more was achieved than just a major
progress in fields such as weather and turbulence [1]. They suggested a radically new view of
stochastic phenomena in physics. Instead of subsuming them under a gross global category such
as“chance??or “randomness”, the concept of chaos offered a detailed analysis on basis of deterministic
evolution equations, thus indicating an identifiable source of stochasticity in macroscopic phenomena.
A seminal insight, to be expounded in Sect. 2, that arose as a spin-off of the study of deterministic
chaos, was that the entropy produced by chaotic systems emerges by amplifying structures, initially
contained in the smallest scales, to macroscopic visibility [2].
Inspired and intrigued by this idea, researchers such as Giulio Casati and Boris Chirikov saw its
potential as a promising approach also towards the microscopic foundations of statistical mechanics,
thus accepting the challenge to extend chaos to quantum mechanics. In the same spirit as those
pioneering works on deterministic chaos, they applied standard quantization to Hamiltonian models
of classical chaos and solved the corresponding Schrödinger equation numerically [3], again utilizing
the powerful computing equipment available at that time. What they obtained was a complete failure
on first sight, but paved the way towards a deeper understanding not only of classical chaos, but also
of the principles of quantum mechanics, concerning in particular the way information is processed

on atomic scales: In closed quantum systems, the entropy production characteristic of classical chaos
ceases after a finite time and gives way to a behaviour that is not only deterministic but even repetitive,
at least in a statistical sense, hence does not generate novelty any longer. The “quantum death of
classical chaos” will be illustrated in Sect. 3.1.
The present article recalls this development, drawing attention to a third decisive aspect that is
able to reconcile that striking discrepancy found between quantum and classical dynamics in closed
chaotic systems. To be sure, the gap separating quantum from classical physics can be bridged to
a certain extent by semiclassical approximations, which interpolate between the two descriptions,
albeit at the expense of conceptual consistency and transparency [4,5]. Also in the case of quantum
chaos they provide valuable insight into the fingerprints classical chaos leaves in quantum systems. A
more fundamental cause contributing to that discrepancy, however, lies in the closure of the models
employed to study quantum chaos. It excludes an aspect of classicality that is essential for the
phenomena we observe on the macroscopic level: No quantum system is perfectly isolated, or else we
could not even know of its existence.
The rôle of being coupled to a macroscopic environment first came into sight in other areas
where quantum mechanics appears incompatible with basic classical phenomena, such as in
particular dissipation [6–8]. Here, even classically, irreversible behaviour can only be reconciled with
time-reversal invariant microscopic equations of motion if a coupling to a reservoir with a macroscopic
number of degrees of freedom (or a quasi-continuous spectrum) is assumed. Quantum mechanically,
this coupling not only explains an irreversible loss of energy, it leads to a second consequence, at
least as fundamental as dissipative energy loss: a loss of information, which becomes manifest as
decoherence [9,10].
In the context of quantum dissipation, decoherence could appear as secondary to the energy
loss, yet it is the central issue in another context where quantum behaviour resisted a satisfactory
interpretation for a long time: quantum measurement. The “collapse of the wavepacket” remained an
open problem even within the framework of unitary quantum mechanics, till it could be traced back
as well to the presence of a macroscopic environment, incorporated in the measurement apparatus
[11–16]. As such, the collapse is not an annoying side effect but plainly indispensable, to make sure
that the measurement leaves a lasting record in the apparatus, thus becoming a fact in the sense of
classical physics. Since there is no dissipation involved in this case, quantum measurement became a
paradigm of decoherence induced by interaction and entanglement with an environment.
The same idea, that decoherence is a constituent aspect of classicality, proves fruitful in the context
of quantum chaos as well [17]. It forms an essential complement to semiclassical approximations, in
that it lifts the “splendid isolation”, which inhibits a sustained increase of entropy in closed quantum
systems. Section 3.2 elucidates how the coupling to an environment restores the entropy production,
constituent for deterministic chaos, at least partially in classically chaotic quantum systems. Combining
decoherence with dissipation, other important facets of quantum chaos come into focus: It opens
the possibility to study quantum effects also in phenomena related to dissipative chaotic dynamics,
notably strange attractors, which, as fractals, are incompatible with uncertainty.
The insight guiding this article is that in the context of quantum chaos, the interaction with an
environment has a double-sided effect: It induces decoherence, as a loss of information, e.g., on phases
of the central quantum system, but also returns entropy from the environment to the chaotic system
[17,18], which then fuels its macroscopic entropy production. If indeed there is a two-way traffic, an
interchange of entropy between system and environment, this principle, applied in turn to quantum
measurement, has a tantalizing consequence: It suggests that besides decoherence, besides the collapse
of the wavepacket, also the randomness apparent in the outcomes of quantum measurements could be
traced back to the environment, could be interpreted as a manifestation of entropy that infiltrates from
the macroscopic apparatus. This speculation is illustrated in Sect. 4 for the emblematic case of spin
measurement. While Sections 2 to 3 largely have the character of reviews, complementing the work of

Entropy 2018, xx, 5

various authors with some original material, Sect. 4 is a perspective, it presents a project in progress at
the time of writing this report.
2. Classical chaos and information flows between micro- and macroscales
2.1. Overview
The relationship between dynamics and information flows has been pointed out by mathematical
physicists, such as notably Kolmogorov, much before deterministic chaos was (re)discovered in applied
science, as is evident for example in the notion of Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy [19]. It measures the
information production by a system with at least one positive Lyapunov exponent and represents a
central result of research on dynamical disorder in microscopic systems, relevant primarily for statistical
mechanics. For models of macroscopic chaos, typically including dissipation, an interpretation as a
phenomenon that has to do with a directed information flow between scales came only much later. A
seminal work in that direction is the 1980 article by Robert Shaw [2], where, in a detailed discussion in
information theoretic terms, the bottom-up information flow related to chaos is contrasted with the
top-down flow underlying dissipation.
Shaw argues that the contraction of phase-space area in a dissipative system results in an
increasing loss of information on its initial state, if the state of the system is observed with a given
constant resolution. Conversely, later states can be determined to higher and higher accuracy from
measurements of the initial state. Chaotic systems show the opposite tendency: Phase-space expansion,
as consequence of exponentially diverging trajectories, allows to retrodict the initial from the present
state with increasing precision, while forecasting the final state requires more and more precise
measurements of the initial state as their separation in time increases.
Chaotic systems therefore produce entropy, at a rate given by their Lyapunov exponents, as
is also reflected in the spreading of any initial distribution with a finite extension. The divergence
of trajectories also indicates the origin of this information: The chaotic flow amplifies details of the
initial distribution with an exponentially increasing magnification factor. If the state of the system is
observed with constant resolution, so that the total information on the present state is bounded, the
gain of information on small details is accompanied by a loss of information on the largest scale, which
impedes inverting the dynamics: Chaotic systems are globally irreversible, while the irreversibility of
dissipative systems is a consequence of their loosing local information into ever smaller scales.
We achieve a more complete picture already by going to Hamiltonian systems, systems with a
phase space of even dimension. Their phase-space flow is symplectic, it conserves phase-space area or
volume, so that every expansion in some direction of phase space must be compensated by contraction
in another direction. In terms of information flows, this means that a bottom-up current from small to
large scales, corresponding to chaotic dynamics, will be accompanied by an opposite current of the
same magnitude, returning information to small scales. In the framework of Hamiltonian dynamics,
however, the top-down current is not related to dissipation, it is not irreversible but to the contrary,
complements the picture in such a way that all in all, the time evolution becomes reversible.
A direct consequence of volume conservation by Hamiltonian flows is that Hamiltonian dynamics
also conserves entropy, see Appendix A. As is true for the underlying conservation of volume, this
invariance proves to be even more general than energy conservation and applies, e.g., also to systems
with a time-dependent external force where the total energy is not conserved. It indicates how to
integrate dissipative systems in this more comprehensive framework: Dissipation and other irreversible
macroscopic phenomena can be described within a Hamiltonian setting by going to models that include
microscopic degrees of freedom, typically as heat baths comprising an infinite number of freedoms, on
an equal footing in the equations of motion. In this way, entropy conservation extends to the entire
system.
The conservation of the total entropy in systems comprising two or more degrees of freedom
or subsystems cannot be broken down, however, to a global sum rule that would imply a simple

Entropy 2018, xx, 5

4 of 41

exchange of information through currents among subsystems. The reason is that in the presence of
correlations, there exists a positive amount of mutual information which prevents subdividing the
total information content uniquely into contributions associated to subsystems or individual degrees
of freedom. Notwithstanding, if the partition is not too complex, as is the case for a central system
coupled to a thermal reservoir or heat bath, it is still possible to keep track of internal information flows
between these two sectors. For the particular instance of dissipative chaos, a gross picture emerges
that comprises three components:
•
•
•

a “vertical” current from large to small scales in certain dimensions within the central system,
representing the entropy loss that accompanies the dissipative loss of energy,
an opposite vertical current, from small to large scales, induced by the chaotic dynamics in other
dimensions of the central system,
a “horizontal” exchange of information between the central system and the heat bath, including a
redistribution of entropy within the reservoir, induced by its internal dynamics.

On balance, more entropy must be dumped by dissipation into the heat bath than is lifted by
chaos into the central system, thus maintaining consistency with the Second Law. In phenomenological
terms, this tendency is reflected in the overall contraction of a dissipative chaotic system onto a strange
attractor. After transients have faded out, the chaotic dynamics then develops on a sub-manifold of
reduced dimension of the phase space of the central system, given by the attractor. For the global
information flow it is clear that in a macroscopic chaotic system, the entropy that surfaces at large scales
by chaotic phase-space expansion has partially been injected into the small scales from microscopic
degrees of freedom of the environment.
Processes converting macroscopic structures into microscopic entropy, such as dissipation, are the
generic case. This report, however, is dedicated to the exceptional cases, notably chaotic systems, which
turn microscopic noise into macroscopic randomness. The final section is intended to demonstrate
that processes even belong to this category where this is far less evident, in particular quantum
measurements.
2.2. Example 1: Bernoulli map and baker map
Arguably the simplest known model for classical deterministic chaos is the Bernoulli map [20,21],
a mapping of the unit interval onto itself that deviates from linearity only by a single discontinuity. It
is defined as
(
x 7→ x 0 = 2x (mod 1) =

2x

0 ≤ x < 0.5,

2x − 1

0.5 ≤ x < 1,

(1)

and can be interpreted as a mathematical model of a popular card-shuffling technique (Fig. 1). The
way it generates information by lifting it from scales too small to be resolved to macroscopic visibility
−n
becomes immediately apparent if the argument x is represented as a binary sequence, x = ∑∞
n =1 a n 2 ,
an ∈ {0, 1}, so that map operates as

that is, the image x 0 has the binary expansion
x0 =

∑ a0n 2−n ,

with a0n = an+1 .

(3)

n =1

The action of the map consists in shifting the sequence of binary coefficients rigidly by one position
to the left (the “Bernoulli shift”) and discarding the most significant digit a1 . In terms of information,

Entropy 2018, xx, 5

this operation creates exactly one bit per time step, coming from the smallest resolvable scales, and at
the same time looses one bit at the largest scale (Fig. 3a), which renders the map non-invertible.

Figure 1. The Bernoulli map can be understood as modelling a popular card shuffling technique (a).
It consists of three steps, (1) dividing the card deck into two halves of equal size, (2) fanning the two
half decks out to twice the original thickness, and (3) intercalating one into the other as by the zipper
method. (b) Replacing the discrete card position in the deck by a continuous spatial coordinate, it
reduces to a map with a simple piecewise linear graph, cf. Eq. (1).

By adding another dimension, the Bernoulli map is readily complemented so as to become
compatible with symplectic geometry. As the action of the map on the second coordinate, say p, has to
compensate for the expansion by a factor 2 in x, this suggests modelling it as a map of the unit square
onto itself, contracting p by the same factor 2,

known as the baker map [19,21]. Geometrically, it can be interpreted as a combination of stretching

Figure 2. The baker map complements the Bernoulli map, Fig. 1, by a second coordinate p, canonically
conjugate to the position x, so as to become consistent with the framework of symplectic phase-space
geometry. Defining the map for p as the inverse of the Bernoulli map applied to x, a map of the unit
square onto itself results, see Eq. (4), that is equivalent to a combination of stretching and folding
steps. The figure shows two subsequent applications of the baker map and its effect on the binary code
associated to a set of four phase-space cells.

The information flows underlying the baker map are revealed by encoding also p as a binary
−n
sequence, p = ∑∞
n=1 bn 2 . The action of the map again translates to a rigid shift,

However, it now moves the sequence by one step to the right, that is, from large to small scales. The
most significant digit b10 , which is not contained in the original sequence for p, is transferred from the
binary code for x, it recovers exactly the coefficient a1 that is discarded due to the expansion in x. This
“pasternoster mechanism” reflects the invertibility of the map. The upward information current in x is
turned around to become a downward current in p (Fig. 3b). A full circle cannot be closed, however,
as long as the “depth” from where and to which the information current reaches, remains unrestricted
by some finite resolution, indicated in Fig. 3, as is manifest in the infinite upper limit of the sums in
Eqs. (2,3,6).

Figure 3. Representing the Bernoulli map, Eq. (1), in terms of its action on a symbol string, the position
encoded as a binary sequence, see Eq. (2), reveals that it corresponds to a rigid shift by one symbol
of the string towards the most significant digit (upper panel). Encoding the baker map, Eq. (4), in
the same way, Eq. (6), shows that the upward symbol shift in x is complemented by a corresponding
downward shift in p (lower panel). The loss of the most significant digit in the Bernoulli map or its
transfer from position to momentum in the baker map are compensated by an equivalent gain or loss at
the least significant digits, if a constant finite resolution is taken into account, here limiting the binary
code to N = 5 digits (dashed vertical lines).

Generalizing the baker map so as to incorporate dissipation is straightforward [20,21]: Just insert
a step that contracts phase space towards the origin in the momentum direction, for example preceding
the stretching and folding operations of Eq. (4),

A contraction by a factor a, 0 < a ≤ 1, models a dissipative reduction of the momentum by the
same factor. Figure 4 illustrates for the first three steps how the generalized baker map operates,
starting from a homogeneous distribution over the unit square. For each step, the volume per strip
reduces by a/2 while the number of strips doubles, so that the overall volume reduction is given by
a. Asymptotically, a strange attractor emerges (rightmost panel in Fig. 4) with a fractal dimension,
calculated as box-counting dimension [22],

(8)

For example, for a = 0.5, as in Fig. 4, a dimension D0 = 0.5 results for the vertical cross section of the
strange attractor, hence D = 1.5 for the entire manifold.

Figure 4. A dissipative version of the baker map is created by preceding each iteration of the map,
as in Fig. 2, with a contraction by a factor a in p (vertical axis), not compensated by a corresponding
expansion in x (horizontal axis), see Eq. (7). The figure illustrates this process for a homogeneous initial
density distribution (m = 0) and a contraction factor a = 0.5 over the first three steps, m = 1, 2, 3.
Asymptoticaly for m → ∞, under the alternation of contraction and splitting, the distribution condenses
onto a strange attractor (rightmost panel) with a fractal dimension D = 1.5.

This model of dissipative chaos is simple enough to allow for a complete balance of all information
currents involved. Adopting the same binary coding as in Eq. (6), a single dissipative step of the
mapping, with a = 0.5, (7) has the effect

Figure 5. (a) In terms of binary strings that encode position x and momentum p, resp., including
dissipative contraction by a factor a = 0.5 in the baker map (see Fig. 4) results in an additional digit 0
fitted in between every two binary digits that are transferred from the upward Bernoulli shift in x to the
downward shift in p. (b) Translated to bottom-up (green) and top-down (pink) information currents,
this means that half of the microscopic information arriving at large scales by chaotic expansion is
diverted by dissipation (blue) to the environment, thus returning to small scales, but in adjacent degrees
of freedom.

Combined with the original baker map (6), this additional step fits in one digit 0 each between
every two binary digits transferred from position to momentum (Fig. 4). In terms of information
currents, this means that only half of the information lifted up by chaotic expansion in x is returned
to small scales by the compensating contraction in p, the other half is diverted by dissipation (Fig. 5).
This particularly simple picture of course owes itself to the special choice of a = 0.5. Still, for other
values of a, different from 1/2 or an integer power thereof, the situation will be qualitatively the same.
The fact that the dissipative information loss occurs here at the largest scales, along with the volume
conserving chaotic contraction in p, not at the smallest as would be expected on physical grounds, is
an artefact of the utterly simplified model.

2.3. Example 2: Kicked rotor and standard map
A model that comes much closer to an interpretation as a physical system than the Bernoulli and
baker maps is the kicked rotor [19,21,23]. It can be motivated as an example, reduced to a minimum
of details, of a circle map, a discrete dynamical system conceived to describe the phase-space flow in
Hamiltonian systems close to integrability. The kicked rotor, the version in continuous time of this
model, can even be defined by a Hamiltonian, but allowing for a time-dependent external force,
H ( p, θ, t) =

∞
p2
+ V ( θ ) ∑ δ ( t − n ),
2
n=−∞

V (θ ) = K cos(θ ).

(11)

It can be interpreted as a plane rotor with angle θ and angular momentum p and with unit inertia,
driven by impulses that depend on the angle as a nonlinear function, a pendulum potential, and on
time as a periodic chain of delta kicks. Their strength is controlled by the parameter K.
Reducing the continuous-time Hamiltonian (11) to a corresponding discrete-time version in the
form of a map is not a unique operation but depends, for example, on the way stroboscopic time
sections are inserted relative to the kicks. For instance, if they follow immediately after each delta kick,
tn = lime&0+ (n + e), n ∈ Z, the map from tn to tn+1 reads

It is often referred to as the standard or Chirikov map [19,21,23].
The dynamical scenario of this model is by far richer than that of the Bernoulli and baker maps
and constitutes a prototypical example of the Kolmogorov-Arnol’d-Moser (KAM) theorem [19]. The
parameter K controls the deviation of the system from integrability. While for K = 0, the kicked rotor is
integrable, equivalent to an unperturbed circle map, increasing K leads through a complex sequence of
mixed dynamics, with regular and chaotic phase-space regions interweaving each other in an intricate
fractal structure. For large values of K, roughly given by K & 1, almost all regular structures in phase
space disappear and the dynamics becomes purely chaotic. For the cylindrical phase space of the kicked
rotor, ( p, θ ) ∈ R ⊗ [0, 2π [, this means that the angle approaches a homogeneous distribution over
the circle, while the angular momentum spreads diffusively over the cylinder, a case of deterministic
diffusion, here induced by the randomizing action of the kicks.
For finite values of K, the spreading of the angular momentum does not yet follow a simple
diffusion law, owing to small non-chaotic islands in phase space [24]. Asymptotically for K → ∞,
however, the angular momentum spreads diffusively,

h( pn − h pi)2 i = D (K )n
with a diffusion constant
D (K ) =

(13)

K2
.

(14)

This regime is of particular interest in the present context, as it allows for a simple estimate of the
entropy production. In the kicked rotor, information currents cannot be separated as neatly as in
the baker map into a macro-micro flow in one coordinate and a micro-macro flow in the other. The
complex fractal phase-space structures imply that these currents are organized differently in each
point in phase space. Nevertheless, some global features, relevant for the total entropy balance, can be
extracted without going to such detail.
Introduce a probability density in phase space that carries the full information available on the
state of the system,

involving the Poisson bracket with the Hamiltonian (11). In order to extract the overall entropy
production from the detailed density ρ( p, θ, t), some coarse graining is required. In the case of
the kicked rotor, it offers itself to integrate ρ( p, θ, t) over θ, since the angular distribution rapidly
approaches homogeneity, concealing microscopic information in fine details, while the diffusive
spreading in p contains the most relevant large-scale structure. A time-dependent probability density

This positive rate decays with time, but only algebraically, that is, without a definite time scale.
Even if dissipation is not the central issue here, including it to illustrate a few relevant aspects in
the present context is in fact straightforward. On the level of the discrete-time map, Eq. (12), a linear

2.4. Anticipating quantum chaos: classical chaos on discrete spaces
Classical chaos can be understood as the manifestation of information currents that lift microscopic
details to macroscopic visibility [2]. Do they draw from an inexhaustible information supply on ever
smaller scales? The question bears on the existence of an upper bound of the information density
in phase space or other physically relevant state spaces, or equivalently, on a fundamental limit
of distinguishability, an issue raised notably also by Gibbs’ paradox [28]. Down to which minute
difference between their states will two physical systems remain distinct? The question has already
been answered implicitly above by keeping the number of binary digits in Eqs. (2,3,6) indefinite,
in agreement with the general attitude of classical mechanics not to introduce any absolute limit of
distinguishability.
A similar situation arises if chaotic maps are simulated on digital machines with finite precision
and/or finite memory capacity [29–32]. In order to assess the consequences of discretizing the state
space of a chaotic system, impose a finite resolution in Eqs. (2,3,6), say d x = 1/J, J = 2 N with N ∈ N,
so that the sums over binary digits only run up to N. This step is motivated, for example, by returning
to the card-shuffling technique quoted as inspiration for the Bernoulli map (Fig. 1). A finite number of
cards, say J, in the card deck, corresponding to a discretization of the coordinate x into steps of size
d x > 0, will substantially alter the dynamics of the model.
More precisely, specify the discrete coordinate as
xj =

j = 1, 2, 3, . . . , J,

These matrices reproduce the graph of the Bernoulli map, Fig. 1, but discretized on a ( J × J ) square
grid. Moreover, they incorporate a deterministic version of the step of interlacing two partial card
decks in the shuffling procedure, in an alternating sequence resembling a zipper. For example, for
J = 8, N = 3, the matrix reads

Figure 6. Three versions of the Bernoulli map exhibit a common underlying structure. The graph of
the classical continuous map, Eq. (1), panel (a), recurs in the structure of the matrix generating the
discretized Bernoulli map (b), Eq. (30), here for cell number J = 16, and becomes visible as well as
marked “ridges” in the unitary transformation generating (c) the quantum baker map, here depicted
as the absolute value of the transformation matrix in the position representation, for a Hilbert space
dimension DH = J = 16. Grey-level code in (b) and (c) ranges from light grey (0) through black (1).

A deterministic dynamics on a discrete state space comprising a finite number of states must
repeat after a finite number M of steps, not larger than the total number of states. In the case of the
Bernoulli map, the recursion time is easy to calculate: In binary digits, the position discretized to
2 N bins is specified by a sequence of N binary coefficients an . The Bernoulli shift moves this entire
sequence in M = N = lb( J ) steps, which is the period of the map. Exactly how the reshuffling of
the cards leads to the full recovery of the initial state after M steps is illustrated in Fig. 7. That is, the
shuffling undoes itself after M repetitions!

Figure 7. If the discreteness of the cards in the card-shuffling model, see Fig. 1a, is included in a

figure shows how it leads to a complete unshufling of the cards after a finite number M = lb( J ) of
steps, here for M = 3. Moreover, a binary coding of the cell index reveals that subsequent positions of
a card are given by a permutation of the binary code.

A similar, but even more striking situation occurs for the baker map, discretized in the same
fashion. While the x-component is identical to the discrete Bernoulli map, the p-component is construed
as inverse of the x-component, cf. Eq. (5). Defining a matrix of probabilities on the discrete ( J × J )
square grid that replaces the continuous phase space of the baker map,

in p (vertical axis), in the pixelated two-dimensional state space entail an exact reconstruction of the
initial state, here after M = lb(16) = 4 iterations of the map.

Both the upward shift of binary digits of the x-component and the downward shift of binary
digits encoding p now become periodic with period M = N, as for the discrete baker map. The two
opposing information currents thus close to a circle, resembling a paternoster lift with a lower turning
point at the least significant and an upper turning point at the most significant digit (Fig. 8).
The fate of deterministic classical chaos in systems comprising only a finite number of discrete
states (of a “granular phase space”) has been studied in various systems [29–32], with the same
general conclusion that chaotic entropy production gives way to periodic behaviour with a period
determined by the size of the discrete state space, that is, by the finite precision underlying its
discretization. To a certain extent, this classical phenomenon anticipates the effects of quantization
on chaotic dynamics, but it provides at most a caricature of quantum chaos. It takes only a single, if
crucial, tenet of quantum mechanics into account, the fundamental bound uncertainty imposes on
the storage density of information in phase space, leaving all other principles of quantum mechanics
aside. Yet it anticipates a central feature of quantum chaos, the repetitive character it attains in closed
systems, and it suggests how to interpret this phenomenon in terms of information flows.

3. Quantum death and incoherent resurrection of classical chaos
While the “poor man’s quantization” discussed in the previous section indicates qualitatively
what to expect if chaos is discretized, reconstructing classically chaotic systems systematically in the
framework of quantum mechanics also allows for a much more profound analysis how these systems
process information. It turns out that quantum mechanics directs our view more specifically to the
aspect of closure of dynamical systems. Chaotic systems provide a particularly sensitive probe, more
so than systems with a regular classical mechanics, of the effects of a complete elimination of external
sources of entropy, since they react even to a weak infiltration of entropy from the environment by a
particularly drastic change of their dynamical behaviour.
3.1. Quantum chaos in closed systems
A straightforward strategy to study the effect first principles of quantum mechanics have on
chaotic dynamics is quantizing models of classical chaos. This requires these models, however,
to be furnished with a minimum of mathematical structure, required to apply basic elements of a
quantum mechanical description. In essence, systems with a volume conserving flow, generated by a
Hamiltonian, on an even-dimensional state space can be readily quantized. In the following, basic
consequences of quantizing chaos will be exemplified applying this strategy to the baker map and the
kicked rotor.
3.1.1. The quantized baker map
The baker map introduced in subsection 2.2 is an ideal model to consider quantum chaos
in a minimalist setting. It already comprises a coordinate together with its canonically conjugate
momentum and can be quantized in an elegant fashion [33–35]. Starting from the operators x̂ and
p̂, p̂ = −ih̄d/dx in the position representation, with commutator [ x̂, p̂] = ih̄, their eigenspaces are
constructed as
eipx/h̄
x̂ | x i = x | x i, p̂| pi = p| pi, h x | pi = √
.
2πh̄

(34)

The finite phase space [0, 1[⊗[0, 1[ ⊂ R2 can be imposed on this pair of operators by assuming
periodicity, say with period 1, both in x and in p. Periodicity in x entails quantization of p and
vice versa, so that together, a Hilbert space of finite dimension J results, and the pair of eigenspaces
(34) is replaced by
j
1
x̂ | ji = | ji, p̂|l i = h̄l |l i, j, l = 0, . . . , J − 1, h j|l i = √ e2πi jl/J = ( FJ ) j,l ,
J
J

(35)

that is, the transformation between the two spaces coincides with the discrete Fourier transform, given
by the ( J × J )-matrix FJ .
This construction facilitates the quantization of the baker map enormously. If we phrase the
classical map qualitatively as the sequence of operations
1. expand the unit square [0, 1[ ⊗[0, 1[ by a factor 2 in x,
2. divide the expanded x-interval into two equal sections, [0, 1[ and [1, 2[,
3. shift the right one of the two rectangles (Fig. 2), ( x, p) ∈ [1, 2[ ⊗ [0, 1[ , by 1 to the left in x and by
1 up in p, [1, 2[ ⊗ [0, 1[ 7→ [0, 1[ ⊗ [1, 2[,
4. contract by 2 in p,
it translates to the following operations on the Hilbert space defined in Eq. (35), assuming the
Hilbert-space dimension J to be even,
J −1

1. in the x-representation, divide the vector of coefficients ( a0 , . . . , a J −1 ), | x i = ∑ j=0 a j | ji, into two
halves, ( a0 , . . . , a J/2−1 ) and ( a J/2 , . . . , a J −1 ) with indices running from 0 to J/2 − 1 and from
J/2 to J − 1, resp.,

Entropy 2018, xx, 5

2. transform both partial vectors separately to the p-representation, applying a ( 2J × 2J )-Fourier
transform to each of them,
3. stack the Fourier transformed right half column vector on top of the Fourier transformed left
half, so as to represent the upper half of the spectrum of spatial frequencies,
4. transform the combined state vector in the J-dimensional momentum Hilbert space back to the x
representation, applying an inverse ( J × J )-Fourier transform.
All in all, this sequence of operations combines to a single unitary transformation matrix in the position
representation

Like this, it already represents a very compact quantum version of the Baker map [33,34]. It
still bears one weakness, however: The origin ( j, l ) = (0, 0) of the quantum position-momentum
space, coinciding with the classical origin ( x, p) = (0, 0) of phase space, creates an asymmetry, as
the diagonally opposite corner 1J ( j, l ) = 1J ( J − 1, J − 1) = (1 − 1J , 1 − 1J ) does not coincide with
( x, p) = (1, 1). In particular, it breaks the symmetry x → 1 − x, p → 1 − p of the classical map. This
symmetry can be recovered on the quantum side by a slight modification [35] of the discrete Fourier
transform mediating between position and momentum representation, a shift by 12 of the two discrete
grids. It replaces FJ by

The matrix B J exhibits the same basic structure as its classical counterpart, the x-component of the
discrete baker map (30), but replaces the sharp “crests” along the graph of the original mapping by
smooth maxima (Fig. 6c). Moreover, its entries are now complex. In momentum representation, the
(p

matrix B J correspondingly resembles the p-component of the discrete baker map.
While the discretized classical baker map (32) merely permutes the elements of the classical
phase-space distribution, the quantum baker map rotates complex state vectors in a Hilbert space of
finite dimension J. We cannot expect periodic exact revivals as for the classical discretization. Instead,
the quantum map is quasi-periodic, owing to phases en of its unimodular eigenvalues eien , which in
general are not commensurate. With a spectrum comprising a finite number of discrete frequencies,
the quantum baker map therefore exhibits an irregular sequence of approximate revivals. They can be
visualized by recording the return probability,
Pret (n) = Tr[Û n ]

with the one-step unitary evolution operator h j|Û | j0 i = ( B J ) j,j0 . Figure 9a shows the return probability
of the (8 × 8) quantum baker map for the first 500 time steps. Several near-revivals are visible; the
(x)

figure also shows the unitary transformation matrix ( B J )n for n = 490 where it comes close to the
(8 × 8) unit matrix (Fig. 9b). Even with these caveats, it is evident that there is no exponential decay of
the return probability, as expected for classical chaos [20].

Figure 9. Recurrences in the quantum baker map are neither periodic nor precise, as in the classical
version, see Fig. 8, but occur as approximate revivals. They can be identified as marked peaks (a) of the
return probability, Eq. (40). For the strong peak at time n = 490 (arrow in panel (a)), the transformation
n (b), cf. Eq. (38), here with J = 8, indeed comes close to a unit
matrix in the position representation Bx,J
matrix. Grey-level code in (b) ranges from light grey (0) through black (1).

3.1.2. The quantum kicked rotor
By contrast to mathematical toy models such as the baker map, the kicked rotor allows to include
most of the features of a fully-fledged Hamiltonian dynamical system, also in its quantization. With
the Hamiltonian (11), a unitary time-evolution operator over a single period of the driving is readily
construed [3,36]. Placing, as for the classical map, time sections immediately after each kick, the
time-evolution operator reads
ÛQKR = Ûkick Ûrot ,




Ûkick = exp −ik cos(θ̂ ) , Ûrot = exp −ih̄lˆ2 .

(41)

The parameter k relates to the classical kick strength as k = K/h̄. Angular momentum p̂ and angle θ̂
are now operators canonically conjugate to one another, with commutator [ p̂, θ̂ ] = −ih̄. The Hilbert
space pertaining to this model is of infinite dimension, spanned for example by the eigenstates of p̂,
p̂|l i = h̄l |l i, l ∈ Z, hθ |l i = √

1
2πh̄

exp(ilθ ).

(42)

Operating on an infinite dimensional Hilbert space, the arguments explaining quasi-periodicity
of the time evolution generated by the quantum baker map do not carry over immediately to the
kicked rotor. On the contrary, one expects to see a similar unbounded growth of the kinetic energy as
symptom of chaotic diffusion as in the classical standard map, in the regime of strong kicking. It was
all the more surprising for Casati et al. [3,36] that their numerical experiments proved the opposite:
The linear increase of the kinetic energy ceases after a finite number of kicks and gives way to an
approximately steady state, with the kinetic energy fluctuating in a quasi-periodic manner around a
constantmean value (Fig. 10).

Figure 10. Suppression of deterministic angular momentum diffusion in the quantum kicked rotor.
Time evolution of the mean kinetic energy, E(n) = h p2n /2i, over the first 1000 time steps, for the
classical kicked rotor, Eq. (11), (dotted) and its quantized version, Eq. (58) (solid line). The parameter
√
values are K = 10 and 2πh̄ = 0.15/G (G := ( 5 − 1)/2).

An explanation was found by analyzing the quasienergy eigenstates of the system [37–40]. With a
time-dependent external force, the kicked rotor does not conserve energy. However, the invariance of
the driving under discrete translations of time, t → t + 1, allows to apply Floquet theory [41,42]. It
implies the existence of eigenstates of ÛQKR with unimodular eigenvalues exp(ie), that is, determined
by eigenphases e.
Quasienergy eigenstates can be calculated by numerical diagonalization of ÛQKR . It turns out that
for generic values of the parameters, they are exponentially localized: On average and superposed
with strong fluctuations, eigenstates |φ(e)i have an exponential envelope of width L around a centre
lc ( e ) ,


|l − lc (e)|
.
|hl |φ(e)i|2 ∼ exp −
L

(43)

The localization length is approximately given by L ≈ (K/2πh̄)2 , hence grows linearly with the
classical diffusion constant, cf. Eq. 14. Exponential localization resembles Anderson localization,
a phenomenon known from solid-state physics [43,44]: In crystalline substances with sufficiently
strong “frozen disorder” (impurities, lattice dislocations, etc.), wavefunctions scattered at nonperiodic
defects superpose destructively, so that extended Bloch states compatible with the priodicity of the
lattice cannot build up. In the kicked rotor, however, the disorder required to prevent extended states
does not arise by any static randomness of a potential nor is it a consequence of the chaotic dynamics
of the classical map. It comes about by a dynamical effect related to the nature of the sequence of
phases h̄l 2 (mod2π ) of the factor Ûrot of the Floquet operator (41). If the parameter h̄/2π— in the
present context, it arises as a dimensionless quantity, Planck’s constant in units of a classical action—is
not a rational, these phases constitute a pseudo-random sequence. In one dimension, this disorder of
number theoretical origin is strong enough to localize eigenstates. Since the rationals form a dense
subset of measure 0 of the real axis, an irrational value of h̄/2π is the generic case.
Even embedded in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, exponential localization reduces the
effective Hilbert-space dimension to a finite number DH , determined by the number of quasienergy
eigenstates that overlap appreciably with a given initial state. For a sharply localized initial state,
say |ψ(0)i = |l0 i, it is given on average by DH = 2L. This explains immediately the crossover from
classical chaotic diffusion to localization described above: In the basis of localized eigenstates, a

Entropy 2018, xx, 5

17 of 41

sharp initial state overlaps with approximately 2L quasienergy states, resulting in the same number of
complex expansion coefficients. The initial “conspiration of phases”, required to construct the initial
state |ψ(0)i = |l0 i, then disintegrates increasingly, with the envelope of the evolving state widening
diffusively, until all phases of the contributing eigenstates have lost their correlation with the initial
state, at a time n∗ ≈ 2L, in number of kicks. The evolving state has then reached an exponential
envelope, similar to the shape of the eigenstates, Eq. (41) (Fig. 12, dashed lines), and its width fluctuates
in a pseudo-random fashion, as implied by the superposition of the 2L complex coefficients involved.
This scenario might appear as an exceptional effect, arising by the coincidence of various special
circumstances. Indeed, there exist a number of details and exceptions, omitted in the present discussion,
that lead to different dynamical behaviour, such as accelerator modes in the classical model [24,45]
and quantum resonances for rational values of h̄/2π [46]. Notwithstanding, similar studies of other
models have accumulated overwhelming evidence that in quantum systems evolving as a unitary
dynamics, a permanent entropy production as in classical chaos is excluded. In more abstract terms,
this “quantum death of classical chaos” can be understood as the consequence of two fundamental
principles: the conservation of information under unitary time evolution, cf. App. B, a conservation
law closely analogous to information conservation under classical canonical transformations (App. A),
and the condition that the initial state contains only a finite amount of information.
This interpretation is corroborated by the global parameters characterizing the behaviour of the
quantum kicked rotor. In the presence of localization, the dimension of the Hilbert space effectively
accessible by an initial condition local in angular momentum is DH ≈ 2L. Even if the initial state is a
pure state with vanishing von-Neumann entropy, the maximum information content it could achieve
by incoherent processes or could produce by a quantum dynamics imitating classical chaos is given
by a homogeneous distribution over DH states, hence by I (0) ≈ c ln(2L). Comparing this with the
entropy production by chaotic diffusion, Eq. (21), the cross-over time n∗ , in units of the kicking period,
till the limited initial supply of quantum entropy is exhausted, can be readily estimated. By equating

and setting D (K ) = K2 /2, as in Eq. (14), and d p = h̄, the angular momentum quantum, it turns out to

and in order of magnitude even as to the prefactor.
3.2. Breaking the splendid isolation: quantum chaos and quantum measurement
If the absence of permanent entropy production in closed quantum systems is interpreted as a
manifestation of quantum coherence, it is natural to inquire how immune this effect is to incoherent
processes. They occur in a huge variety of circumstances: in quantum systems embedded in a material
environment, as in molecular and solid state physics, interacting with a radiation field, as in quantum
optics, in dissipative quantum systems where decoherence accompanies an irreversible energy loss,
and most notably in all instances of observation, be it by measurement in a laboratory or by leaving
any kind of permanent record in the environment [47], even in the absence of a human observer.
In the present context, measurements are of particular interest, since they allow to separate
neatly two distinct phenomena, the loss of energy to the environment and the exchange of entropy

Entropy 2018, xx, 5

with it. Quantum measurement has been in the focus of quantum theory from the early pioneering
years on. It provides the indispensable interface with the macroscopic world. The crucial step
from quantum superpositions to alternative classical facts remained an enigma for decades. The
Copenhagen interpretation includes the “collapse of the wavepacket” as an essential element [48], but
treats it as an unquestionable postulate. The first systematic analysis of quantum measurement by von
Neumann [49] already provides a quantitative description in terms of the density operator, rendering
the wavepacket collapse explicit as a reduction of the density matrix to its diagonal elements, but
does not yet illuminate the physical nature of this step, manifestly incompatible with the Schrödinger
equation. It was the contribution of Zurek and others [11–14,50] to interpret this process, in the spirit
of quantum dissipation, as the consequence of the interaction with the macroscopic number of degrees
of freedom of the measurement apparatus (the “meter”) and its environment, to be described in a
microscopic model as a heat bath or reservoir. As one of the major implications of this picture, the
collapse of the wavepacket no longer appears as an unstructured point-like event but as a continuous
process that can be resolved in time [14].
3.2.1. Modelling continuous measurements on the quantum kicked rotor
In this subsection, basic elements of this scheme will be adopted and applied to the quantum
kicked rotor in order to demonstrate how observation can thaw dynamical localization and thus restore,
at least partially, an entropy production as in classical chaos. Reducing quantum measurement to the
essential, a continuous observation of the kicked rotor will be assumed, which leads to an irreversible
record of a suitable observable [51]. Following established models of quantum measurement [11–14,
18,50], these features can be incorporated in a system-meter interaction Hamiltonian [52–54]
HSM = g x̂M x̂S Θ(t),

(47)

where g controls the coupling strength and the Heaviside function Θ(t) switches the measurement
on at t = 0. The operator x̂M , acting on the Hilbert space of the meter, is the observable that indicates
the measurement result (its “pointer operator” [11–14]), and x̂S is the measured observable. In accord
with the objective to study the impact of observation on localization in angular momentum space, we

Alternatively, a simultaneous observation of the full angular-momentum distribution P(l ), so that the
measurement affects homogeneously the entire angular momentum axis, requires assuming a separate

Some models of quantum measurement distinguish explicitly between the meter proper, as a
microscopic system interacting directly with the observed object, and a macroscopic apparatus that
couples in turn to the meter [50], thus only indirectly to the object. Such a distinction is not necessary
in the present context, it suffices to merge meter and environment into a single macroscopic system.
Moreover, we do not conceive a detailed microscopic model of the meter as a heat bath (but see
Sections 4.2, 4.3 below), starting instead directly from an evolution equation that takes the essential
consequences of the meter’s macroscopic nature into account.
Specifically, the response of the meter is assumed to be Markovian, that is, to be immediate on the
time-scales of the measured system, which in turn requires the spectrum of the underlying heat bath

Figure 12. Dynamical localization is destroyed in the quantum kicked rotor with continuous
measurements. Probability distribution P(l ) of the angular momentum l, after the first 512 time
steps, for the measured dynamics of the quantum kicked rotor, Eq. (58) (solid lines), compared to
the unmeasured dynamics of the same system, Eq. (58) (dashed), for (a) weak vs. (b) strong effective
coupling. A continuous measurement of the full action distribution was assumed. The parameter
√
values are K = 5, 2πh̄ = 0.1/G (G := ( 5 − 1)/2), and ν = 10−4 (a), ν = 0.5 (b).

The map alternates the unitary time evolution of the quantum kicked rotor with incoherent
steps that lead to a gradual decay of the non-diagonal elements of the density matrix. In the limit of
strong effective coupling to the meter, γ  1, corresponding to a high-accuracy measurement of the
angular momentum, the density matrix is completely diagonalized anew at each time step, and the
object system leaves the measurement in an incoherent superposition of angular-momentum states, as
required by the principles of quantum measurement (Figs. 11b, 12b). For a weaker coupling, the loss
of coherence per step is only partial, restricting the density matrix to a diagonal band with a Gaussian
profile of width ∼ γ−1 , if hl i is measured, or reducing its off-diagonal elements homogeneously by e−γ ,
if the full distribution is recorded (Figs. 11a, 12a). In any case, decoherence in the angular momentum
representation is equivalent to a diffusive spreading of the angle θ. It imitates the action of classical
chaos in that it effectively destroys the autocorrelation of the angle variable.
The framework set by Eq. (53) is easily extended to include dissipation [55–57]. An additional
term, proportional to the friction constant λ,

induces incoherent transitions between angular momentum eigenstates towards lower values of l,
modelling Ohmic friction with a damping constant λ, as in the classical standard map with dissipation,
Eqs. (23,24,25) [26,27]. In terms of a classical stochastic dynamics, to be detailed in the following
subsection, it corresponds to a drift of the probability density in phase space towards lower angular
momentum.
3.2.2. Semiclassical Langevin approximation for the measured quantum dynamics
Describing the quantum dynamics in terms of a master equation for the reduced density operator
only provides a global statistical account. However, in the semiclassical regime of small h̄, compared
to the periodicity in p of the classical phase space, it can be replaced by an approximate description as
a classical Langevin equation with a noise term of quantum origin that induces diffusion in θ [52–54].
In this limit, the Wigner function, which represents the density operator in a quantum equivalent of
classical phase space (with quantized momentum, though), evolves as a phase-space flow following

Entropy 2018, xx, 5

3.2.3. Numerical results
Numerical experiments performed with both, the quantum map for the density matrix, Eqs.
(57,58), and its semiclassical approximation, Eqs. (60,62), give a detailed picture of the effect of
continuous observation on quantum chaos [52–54]. Figure 11 compares the time dependence of the
mean kinetic energy for the quantum kicked rotor, Eq. (41) (dashed lines), the same system under
continuous measurement, Eq. (58) (solid lines), and the stochastic classical map, Eqs. (60,61) (dotted).
Above all, the data shown provide clear evidence that incoherent processes induced by measurements
destroy dynamical localization. Even for weak coupling to the apparatus, Figs. 11a, 12a, classical angular
momentum diffusion is recovered, albeit on a time scale nc ≈ ν−1 , much larger than the cross-over time
n∗ , cf. Eq. (46), if ν  1/2L, and with a diffusion constant Dqm ≈ D (K )n∗ /nc , reduced accordingly
with respect to its classical value D (K ). For stronger coupling, the measurement-induced diffusion
approaches the classical strength D (K ). Since it randomizes the angle variable indiscriminately, erasing
all fine structure in classical phase space, it ignores deviations of D (K ) from the gross estimate (14),
caused, e.g., by accelerator modes of the classical standard map [24,45]. In fact, measurement-induced
diffusion occurs already for kick strengths K < Kc , below the classical threshold to chaotic diffusion
Kc ≈ 1, where in the exact classical map, diffusion is still blocked by regular tori extending across the
full range θ ∈ [0, 2π [. Moreover, Fig. 13b, showing the angular momentum distribution after 512 time
steps, demonstrates that at this stage, the typical exp(−|l |/L) shape indicating localization has given
way to a Gaussian envelope, characteristic of diffusion.
Figure 13 compares the angular momentum reached after 512 time steps for the measured
quantum system in the description by the master equation (58) (dotted lines) with that obtained for the
noisy map (60) (solid lines). For sufficiently strong coupling, Fig. 13b, it is faithfully reproduced by the
semiclassical Langevin equation (60), as is the overall energy growth, see Fig. 11b (dotted line).

The diffusion constant of the measurement-induced angular momentum diffusion also allows us
to estimate directly the entropy produced by the measured quantum system: Replacing in Eq. (21) the
classical diffusion constant D (K ) by the reduced quantum mechanical value Dqm yields

As the production rate for diffusive spreading is independent of the diffusion constant, it is here
the same as for the classical standard map, İ (t) = c/2t. Such a positive entropy production is
not compatible with entropy conservation in closed quantum systems, App. B. The only possible
explanation therefore refers to the measured quantum system not being closed, so that the entropy
generated actually infiltrates from the macroscopic meter to which it is coupled. This interpretation
becomes plausible also considering the fact that obviously, there must be an entropy flow from the
object towards the meter—or else the measured data could not reach it: There is no reason why the
information current from object to meter should not be accompanied by an opposite current, from
meter to object.
The three phases of the time evolution of, in particular, the weakly (i.e., with small coupling to
the meter) measured quantum kicked rotor can now be interpreted from the point of view of entropy
flows: During the initial phase, n . n∗ , the quantum map follows closely the classical standard map,
producing entropy from its own supply provided by the initial state. Once this supply is exhausted, at
n ≈ n∗ , entropy production stalls, the system localizes and crosses over to quasi-periodic fluctuations.
Only on a much longer time-scale, for n & nc  n∗ , sufficient entropy infiltrates from the meter to
become manifest again in the dynamics of the kicked rotor as diffusive angular momentum spreading.
Incorporating friction gives the opportunity to take a look also at the modifications of classical
dissipative chaos with that are required by quantization, in particular of the fractal geometry of strange
attractors. The master equation (59) as well as the stochastic semiclassical approximation, Eq. (62), can
be solved numerically and compared with the classical dissipative standard map (23) [55–57]. Fig. 14
compares the stationary states approached by these maps for n  1/λ, the time scale of contraction
onto the attractor. The classical strange attractor, Fig. 14a, here represented as its support in ( p, θ ) phase
space, roughly follows a (− sin θ)-curve. The stationary state of the full quantum master equation,
depicted as the Wigner function corresponding to the stationary density operator, Fig. 14c, shows
a smoothed structure that eliminates the self-similarity of the classical fractal geometry. The wavy
modulations visible in panel (c) are owed to the tendency of Wigner function to exhibit fringes where

4. Quantum measurement and quantum randomness in a unitary setting
In the examples discussed in the preceding sections, the central issue was chaotic entropy
production and its suppression by coherence effects in closed quantum systems. Measurement served
as a particular case of interaction with a macroscopic environment, giving rise to a two-way exchange
of information. A transfer of information on the state of the object is the essence of measurement. It
does not even require a human observer, the physical environment can play the rôle of the “witness”
[47]. Conversely, entropy entering the measured object from the side of the apparatus imparts a
stochastic component to the proper dynamics of the object [18]. Quantum chaos is specially sensitive
to this effect, as it amplifies even minuscule amounts of entropy penetrating from outside and displays
them directly as a drastic change of behaviour.
The present section takes up this idea to apply it within the context of quantum measurement,
to situations where inherent instabilities of the measurement process itself, instead of a sensitive
dependence on initial conditions of a measured chaotic system, let us expect similar effects as in the
case of quantum chaos. It is not obvious, though, where in the context of measurement instabilities
should exist, of a kind even remotely comparable to chaotic dynamics. To see this, a final step has to
be added to the above outline of the quantum measurement process.
4.1. Quantum randomness from quantum measurement
The collapse of the wavepacket is not only incompatible with a unitary time evolution, it also
violates the conservation of entropy (App. B). If the measured system is initiated in a pure state,

|ψS,ini i = ∑ aα |αi,

(64)

α

(assuming a discrete basis of eigenstates of the measured operator, x̂ |αi = xα |αi, α ∈ Z) a complete
collapse leads to a mixed state comprising the same components,

Entropy 2018, xx, 5

25 of 41

ρ̂S,ini = |ψS,ini ihψS,ini | → ρ̂S,coll =

∑ pα |αihα|,

p α = | a α |2 .

(65)

α

The increase in entropy from the pure initial state (Iini = 0) is thus
Icoll = −c Tr (ρ̂S,coll ln(ρ̂S,coll )) = −c ∑ pα ln( pα ).

(66)

α

It is readily explained and can be modelled in microscopic detail as a consequence of the entanglement
of the object with the macroscopic apparatus [11–14,18,50], which in the reduced density operator
of the object becomes manifest as information gain. The density operator, reduced to its diagonal,
hα|ρ̂S,coll |α0 i = pα δα0 −α , is interpreted as a set of probabilities pα for the measurement resulting in the
eigenvalue xα of the measured operator x̂.
With this step, the measurement is not yet complete. From the Copenhagen interpretation
onwards [48], all quantum measurement schemes add a crucial final transition, to the object exiting
the process again in a pure state, one of the eigenstates |αi,

(67)

returning the information content to its initial value, Ifin = Iini = 0. This step is sometimes referred
to as “second collapse of the wavepacket”. In contrast to the “first collapse”, though, it is usually
considered to be of little interest for the discussion of fundamentals of quantum mechanics, since it
appears as a mere classical random process, analogous to drawing from an urn.
Indeed, on the face of it, there is not even a credit left in the information balance between initial
and final states. Both are pure. However, the random process behind the phrase “with probability
pα ” does have a quantum mechanical side to it. This applies at least to all measurements of operators
with a discrete spectrum, such as, for example, the angular momentum lˆ featured in the context of the
kicked rotor.
It becomes particularly evident in the case of operators on finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces,
notably and as the simplest possible instance, two-state systems (“qbits”), say H = span{|↓i, |↑i},
x̂ |↓i = − 2h̄ |↓i, x̂ |↑i = 2h̄ |↑i. If the initial state is a Schrödinger cat, neutral with respect to measurements
of x̂,
1
|ψS,ini i = √ (|↓i ± |↑ii),
2

(68)

the results |↓ih↓| and |↑ih↑| are expected with equal probabilities p↓ = p↑ = 0.5. While each outcome
is a pure state with definite eigenvalue, repeated measurements of an ensemble of systems in the
same initial state result in a random binary sequence, distinguished as “quantum randomness” and
considered unpredictable in a more fundamental sense than any classical stochastic process [58]. The
von-Neumann entropy, as canonical measure of the information contained in a quantum system, is not
able to capture the difference between a pure state resulting from a deterministic preparation and an
element of a sequence of pure states which, as an ensemble, represent a prototypical random process.
The mere existence of a set of privileged states, the eigenstates of the measured operator (forming
the “pointer basis”, a term coined by Zurek [11–14]), of course does not imply any instability. To be
sure, the conservation under unitary transformations of the overlap hφ|ψi as a measure of distance
between two states | psi i, |φi ensures that there cannot be any attractors or repellers in Hilbert space
[59]. This situation changes, however, as soon as the non-unitary dynamics of incoherent processes in
the projective Hilbert space is concerned. In quantum measurement, in particular, the quantum Zeno
effect [60,61] plays a pivotal rôle [12]: If a measurement is made on a state vector that is about to rotate

Entropy 2018, xx, 5

26 of 41

away from a pointer-basis state it has been prepared in, for example by a previous measurement, this
subsequent measurement will project the state back to the nearest pointer basis state as indicated by
Eq. (67) [11–14], that is, the state it just departed from. The more frequently the same measurement
is being repeated, the stronger will be its stabilizing effect towards the initial pointer state: it thus
becomes an attractor in the projective Hilbert space of the measured object [11,12].
If there is not just a single such state but a finite or even countably infinite number of attractors,
it is clear that their basins of attraction in projective Hilbert space must be separated by boundaries,
manifolds along which the system is unstable. For example, for a two-state system, the projective
Hilbert space is the Bloch sphere, its poles representing the pointer states, hence the attractors for
measurements of the vertical spin component (Fig. 16). Symmetry already implies that the boundary
separating their basins of attraction, the two hemispheres, must be the equator, representing the
manifold all Schrödinger-cat states as defined in Eq. (68). Of course, the attraction towards the poles is
strongest in their immediate neighbourhood and vanishes for states orthogonal to the pointer states,
as applies to all states along the equator.
The description in terms of an evolution equation for the density operator, such as the master
equation (53), however does not allow to go beyond stating likelihoods, in this example equal
probabilities for the two outcomes. Otherwise, it leaves the second collapse as a black box. A
more profound analysis is possible, though, by going to a detailed microscopic account of the coupled
object-meter system. Since this comprehensive system is closed as a whole, it not only permits a
description in the framework of unitary time evolution. The conservation of entropy moreover opens
the possibility to follow the information interchanged between the two subsystems.
4.2. Spin measurement in a unitary setting
The setup sketched in Sect. 3.2.1 is a suitable starting point for a model of measurements on a
two-state system. In order to include a microscopic account of the meter, it is broken down into a set
of, say, harmonic oscillators with frequencies ωn . The measurement object now reduces to a spin- 12
system. Modifying the object-meter coupling, Eqs. (49,48) accordingly, it now takes the form

where the measured observable is specified as x̂S = σ̂z , the vertical spin component, coupled with a

results. In terms of quantum optics, for instance, it can be interpreted as describing a two-level atom
interacting with a microwave cavity supporting discrete modes n [62].
The model is not complete without specifying the initial state of the total system. Supposing that
it factorizes between object and meter [11,12,49,50],

|Ψini i = |ψS,ini i|ψM,ini i,

(71)

the initial states of the two components can be defined separately. For the object, assume a state that
is neutral with respect to measurements of σ̂z , as in Eq. (68). The initial state of the meter should not
introduce a spatial bias of position or momentum, either, so that h x̂M i = 0, h p̂M i = 0, but otherwise
can be an arbitrary coherent superposition of harmonic oscillator states.

A crucial issue concerning Hamiltonian and the initial condition is their symmetry under spatial
reflections with respect to the direction of the vertical spin component, z → −z. The total Hamiltonian
as well as the initial state of the object should be invariant under this transformation, otherwise the
measurement would be biased. This symmetry is equivalent to parity in the z-direction, effectuated by

operators Π̂z,S = σ̂x for the two-state system and Π̂z,M = exp iπ ∑n â†n ân for the meter [63], so that
the total system must be invariant under the transformation

(73)

Given this invariance, the Hilbert space of the total system decomposes into two eigensubspaces of Π̂z ,

H = H+ ⊗ H− ,

(74)

H+ comprising symmetric, H− antisymmetric states under Π̂z . As the object (two-state) as well as the
meter (boson) sector of the total system can each be decomposed individually into an even and an odd
subspace, the parity subspaces decompose further into
H+ = HS,+ ⊗ HM,+ ⊕ HS,− ⊗ HM,− ,
H− = HS,+ ⊗ HM,− ⊕ HS,− ⊗ HM,+ .

(75)

At the same time, both possible measurement outcomes, | ↓i as well as | ↑i, manifestly break
the invariance under z → −z individually, even if on average, the balance is equilibrated. In the
framework of a unitary time evolution, where the Hamiltonian as well as the initial state of the object
are symmetric, the only possible explanation left is that the asymmetry is introduced by the initial state
of the meter.
Reconstructing the measurement in a unitary account of the full object-meter system allows us to
pursue the time evolution of the total state vector in continuous time. Yet it is desirable, in order to
compare with the standard view of quantum measurement, to record diagnostics that enable assessing
the progress towards a definite classical outcome. Two aspects are of particular significance for this
purpose: The approach of the spin component towards a pure state can be quantified in terms of the
von-Neumann entropy [49] of the reduced density operator

or more specifically as its purity, PS (t) = TrS ρ̂2S (t) . Representing ρ̂S (t) as a Bloch vector a =
( a x , ay , az ), a x := 12 Tr(ρ̂S σ̂x etc., the purity is reflected in its length, PS (t) = 12 (1 + |a|2 ). The asymmetry

4.3. Simulating decoherence by finite heat baths
An essential condition to achieve an irreversible loss of coherence in a system coupled to a
macroscopic environment is that the spectrum of the environment, be it composed of harmonic
oscillators, spins [64], or other suitable microscopic models, be continuous on the energy scales of
the central system, or equivalently, that the number N of modes the environment comprises be large,
N  1. As a general rule, based on energy-time uncertainty, recurrences occur on a time scale 1/∆ω if
the spectrum exhibits structures on the scale ∆ω. However, in the present context of a unitary model
for quantum measurement, it is more appropriate to avoid the limit N → ∞. Evidently, this can be
achieved only if at the same time, irreversibility as a hallmark of decoherence is sacrificed.
This price appears acceptable, though, as long as a faithful description of the processes of interest
is required only over a correspondingly large, but finite time scale, as is the case, for example,
in computational molecular physics and in quantum optics. Numerical experiments simulating
decoherence with heat baths of finite Hilbert space dimension [65–67] provide convincing evidence
that even with a surprisingly low number of bath modes, N of the order of 10, most relevant features of
decoherence can be satisfactorily reproduced, see Fig. 15. This suggests to restrict the dimension of the
meter sector of the Hilbert space underlying the Hamiltonian (70) accordingly to a finite number N,

Like this, the Hamiltonian can be considered as a model of, e.g., a two-level atom in a high-Q microwave
cavity [62]. The mode number N thus assumes the rôle of a central parameter of the model.
Concluding from the experience with similar models comprising finite baths [65,67], the following
scenarios appear plausible:
• For small values N & 1, the time evolution comprises only a few, but typically incommensurate,
frequencies and should appear quasi-periodic.
• Already for moderate numbers, say N = O(10), the unitary model will exhibit some characteristic
features of quantum measurement. In particular, a plausible scenario is that the object state
approaches one of the pointer states and remains in its vicinity for a longer time, before it may
jump to another (in the case of spin measurement, the opposite) pointer state. A similar behaviour
has indeed been observed for standard models of quantum optics and solid-state physics and is
known as “collapses and revivals” [62].
• For N  1, the excursions of the object state away from pointer states will become smaller
and the frequency of switching episodes—spin flips in the case of spin measurements—should
reduce, that is, the times the object spends close to a pointer state should grow very large. In
particular, as soon as the object state is sufficiently close to one of the pointer states, a behaviour
reminiscent of the quantum Zeno effect should emerge [12].
• With these intermediate stages, the limit N → ∞ where a definite measurement result is
irreversibly achieved, while out of reach of finite-bath models proper, could still be approached
through of a continuous transition.
In fact, a similar scenario has been envisaged for a model in the spirit of quantum optics, representing
the object by a two-state atom and meter and environment, respectively, by two microwave cavities
coupled through a waveguide [62].

also referred to as spin-boson Hamiltonian or quantum Rabi model [68,69], is frequently employed as the
standard model for two-level atoms interacting with a bosonic field. It is often considered in a slightly
simplified version: If a rotating-wave approximation is applied that excludes double excitation or
de-excitation processes (generated by σ̂+ â† or σ̂− â), the interaction term reduces to ĤSM = g(σ̂+ â +
σ̂− â† ), denoting σ̂± := 12 (σ̂x ∓ iσ̂y ). With this modification, the spin-boson Hamiltonian is also known
as Jaynes-Cummings model. The emblematic feature exhibited by spin-boson systems are Rabi oscillations,
oscillations of the two-state system between its lower and its upper level with a frequency proportional
to the coupling g. A further simplification of Eq. (79), often called semi-classical Rabi model, replaces the
coupling to the boson mode with frequency ω1 by an external driving with the same frequency [70,71],
Hscl = 12 h̄ω0 σ̂x + gσ̂z cos(ω1 t).
With the Hamiltonian (79), it is straightforward to specify the parity eigensubspaces referred to in
Eq. (75). The even eigenspace comprises states of the form

Numerical results for the quantum dynamics, generated both by the Jaynes-Cummings model [72]
and by the complete spin-boson Hamiltonian [68,69], in a parameter regime relevant for the present
modelling, in particular for strong coupling, exist already and are consistent with the expectations
pointed out here. For the present application to quantum measurement, there is no obvious justification
for a rotating-wave approximation. With the full Hamiltonian (79), the von-Neumann equation for the
density operator, ih̄ dρ̂/dt = [ Hsb , ρ̂] is readily evaluated at t = 0 (App. C). Assuming an initial state

Figure 16. Spin measurement on the Bloch sphere. The quantum dynamics of spin measurements
is dominated by two “pointer states”, eigenstates of the measured operator σ̂z , i.e., | ↑z i and | ↓z i,
represented on the Bloch sphere as North (green dot) and South pole (red dot). Owing to the quantum
Zeno effect, they attract nearby states of the measured system. At the same time, the short-time
evolution of the measured spin for a meter comprising only a single boson mode, Eq. (86), suggests
that a state initiated on the equator of the Bloch sphere (black dot), besides rotating around the equator,
will tend towards one of the poles, depending on the initial state of the meter boson mode.

This result indicates that to second order in time, a state prepared as a Schrödinger cat with
respect to vertical spin will exhibit polarization if the initial state of the boson fulfills a specific
condition. The terms in the sum over α in Eq. (86) only contribute if not all products cα+1 c∗α of two
subsequent expansion coefficients vanish. It has an obvious interpretation in terms of symmetry: The
boson components in the eigensubspaces of the parity operator Π̂z , Eqs. (80,81), are characterized by
encompassing exclusively even or exclusively odd components of each sector, spin and boson, of the
total system. The condition cα+1 c∗α 6= 0 for the boson sector therefore implies that the initial state of the
meter must not belong to either one of the two eigensubspaces, hence must break z → −z parity, while
the initial state of the spin itself has to remain unbiased.
If this preliminary finding is combined with the quantum Zeno effect (Sect. 4.1), a scenario
emerges where initial states, unbiased as to spin polarization, will tend to move away from the equator
of the Bloch sphere, the attraction basin boundary between spin-up and spin-down, in a direction
depending on the initial state of the meter, to become increasingly attracted by that pole of the Bloch
sphere they are already approaching, see Fig. 16.
4.4. A classical analogue of spin measurement
Following a similar research program as in quantum chaos, comparing quantum dynamics to
its closest classical analogue, it would be tempting to study the unitary model for spin measurement
sketched above in some appropriate classical limit. For the boson sector, no approximations are even
necessary, as the heat bath composed of harmonic oscillators is its own classical limit. The two-state
system representing the measurement object, however, is located in the opposite, the extreme quantum
regime. A classical limit in the formal sense does not exist or it. However, a model, closely analogous
in many respects to a spin measurement, can be conceived that already provides relevant insights.

Figure 17. Damped motion in a symmetric double-well potential. In a quartic potential with a
symmetric parabolic barrier (a), Eq. (87), from an initial state with zero momentum in the unstable
equilibrium position on top of the barrier, random impacts from an environment will send the system
√
with equal probability towards one of the potential minima at ± x0 = ± a/b. In the presence of
friction, Eq. (91), it will come to rest, once transient oscillations are damped out, in that well which it
approached initially, giving rise to (b) basins of attraction associated to either one of the wells. The
parameter values of Eq. (91) are a = 0.25, b = 0.01, γ = 0.04.

The fact that, in the limit of a quasi-continuous heat bath, the two opposite pointer states act as
attractors in Hilbert space suggests to compare them with a bistable classical system. A paradigm for
bistability is a double well potential, say a symmetric quartic double-well with a parabolic barrier (Fig.

the total Hamiltonian takes the form

(90)

It is evidently symmetric under the parity operation PxS ,x : ( pS , xS ) → (− pS , − xS ), (p, x) → (−p, −x).
An initial condition that comes as close as possible to Eq. (71), in particular to the Schrödinger cat
state for the spin, would combine the double-well system prepared at rest in the unstable equilibrium
position on top of the barrier (call it a “Buridan’s ass state”), pS (0) = 0, xS (0) = 0, with an arbitrary
initial condition of the heat bath oscillators, p(0) = p0 , x(0) = x0 . Suitable metaphors for this model
are an inverted pendulum or a pencil, initially balanced exactly vertically, tip down on a surface,
exposed to the impinging molecules of the surrounding medium.
As in the quantum model, the number of degrees of freedom N of the heat bath is a decisive
parameter. Already for N = 1, chaotic behaviour is expected for the coupled system. In the limit N →
∞, it should approach an irreversible dynamics, characterized by dissipation. With a position-position
coupling as in Eq. (89) and under similar conditions for the spectrum of the heat bath, it will take the
form of Ohmic friction (proportional to the velocity of the damped degree of freedom). For the object,
this would imply an equation of motion such as

Entropy 2018, xx, 5

33 of 41

mS ẍS = −λ ẋS + axS − bxS3 ,

(91)

with a friction coefficient λ that depends on the microscopic coupling g and the spectrum of the heat
bath. For moderate values of γ, the system will fall from the top of the barrier into one of the wells
and, after oscillations within that well have faded out, remain at rest in that well. As the Hamiltonian
as well as the initial state of the object are parity symmetric, it is the initial conditions of the heat bath
oscillators which determine into which one of the two wells the object will fall. While the boundary
between the basins of attraction of the two wells (Fig. 17b) passes exactly through the origin of phase
space, that is, through the supposed initial state pS (0) = 0, xS (0) = 0, it becomes fuzzy in the presence
of the environment and is displaced slightly towards one of the two wells, depending on the initial
condition of the environment. For the inverted pendulum alluded to above this means that it will tilt
over in a direction determined by the impact of the molecules of the surrounding medium.
A similar model for a classical binary “random” (but in fact deterministic) process, a coin toss,
has been analyzed in all detail in Ref. [73]. Diaconis et al. construct a phase-space plot of the basin
boundaries separating initial conditions of the coin that lead to either one of the two alternative
final outcomes “head” and “tail”, and which shows a marked structure of alternating fine fringes
corresponding to these final conditions. While in the case of coin tosses, the sensitive dependence
on the initial condition of the coin itself serves as random generator, it is microscopic details of the
initial state of the environment that contribute the required entropy in the above classical model of
spin measurement.
4.5. Perspectives
A unitary account of quantum measurements with random outcome, as outlined in this section,
is presently being worked out. Starting from the analytical framework presented here, it requires
massive numerical calculations. The quantum model with finite mode number N can be evaluated in
numerical simulations following a similar strategy as in the cited work on finite heat baths in optics
and quantum molecular dynamics. The classical model of a bistable measurement process gives rise to
sets of coupled Hamiltonian equations of motion that can be integrated using symplectic solvers.
In both cases, the immediate objective is to increase the mode number as far as possible, in order
to come close to an irreversible behaviour, at least on time scales larger than all characteristic times of
the object. The scenario sketched above for sufficiently high values of N is a plausible expectation,
based on arguments involving analogies and extrapolating known results. If it proves correct, a strong
point would be made in favour of an alternative view of quantum randomness. Instead of interpreting
it as a fundamental element of quantum mechanics that remains out of reach of its standard formalism,
it would integrate it in a similar category of in principle deterministic, but practically incalculable
many-body phenomena as, e.g., classical thermal fluctuations or Brownian motion. The randomness
manifest in spin measurement would be revealed as analogous to quantum vacuum state fluctuations,
amplified to macroscopic observability and frozen in a lasting record.
If, on the contrary, quasi-stable measurement outcomes should not be achieved even for values
N  1, this would provide strong evidence that quantum measurement involves a class of randomness
that is fundamentally different from all other known sources of stochastic behaviour and will remain
an alien element in the framework of quantum mechanics. It would constitute a compelling reason
to explore unprecedented ideas—after all, the general problems pointed out above, concerning the
information balance and spontaneous symmetry breaking in the “second collapse”, remain pressing.
An unexpected but important consequence of this view is that it effectively merges the “first”
and the “second” collapse of the wavepacket into a single unitary process. In this way, it avoids the
conceptually inconvenient detour from a pure initial state (a Schrödinger cat) to a mixture, after the
first collapse, and back to a pure state (a definite measurement result) and in particular complies with
entropy conservation throughout the entire measurement.

Entropy 2018, xx, 5

Besides this central message, a unitary account of quantum measurement has various additional
testable implications, which substantiate its strength and facilitate its falsification:
• The approach of the object state to one of the pointer states, as final result of the measurement, will
never be complete. In the limit N → ∞, the discrepancy is expected to become arbitrarily small,
but the postulate of pure states resulting from quantum measurement cannot be accomplished
literally.
• Owing to the unavoidable entanglement between object and meter, the initial state of the
meter does not only affect the final state of the object (the result), the state of the object
upon leaving the apparatus also leaves a trace in the meter, which can then be probed by
the following measurement. This implies the possibility of correlations between subsequent
spin measurements, otherwise incompatible with their randomness, if their separation in time is
extremely short.
• Spin measurements on systems prepared as Schrödinger cats with respect to the measured spin
component, a paradigm of quantum randomness, are in the focus of this work. Notwithstanding,
also “redundant” measurements, performed on systems that are prepared already with a
definite polarization in the measured direction, are of interest in this context: The existence
of a back-action of the meter on the object implies that even in the case of redundant
measurements, albeit with very low probability, the measurement process could alter the spin
polarization—trigger a spin flip—so that the result would not coincide with the state of the spin
upon entering the apparatus.
• The approach outlined herein emphasizes the relevance of the meter state for the measurement
outcome. Besides its initial state proper, this includes also characteristic properties of the meter,
such as its eigenenergy spectrum and the way it couples to the object. Unconventional features,
achieved by some special design, may then be reflected in unexpected features also of the
statistics of the measurement results. If, for example, the “meter” is represented by a microwave
cavity, as is often the case in quantum optics, particular structures in the cavity spectrum could
have an observable effect on the measurement results.
• In state-of-the-art laboratory experiments on quantum randomness [58], photons in
counter-rotating polarization states replace the spins traditionally used as qbits in this context. It
appears possible and tempting to work out the theory developed here so as to apply it to photon
experiments.
Random spin measurements are almost invariably discussed in a special context where indeed
they play a crucial rôle: Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) experiments [74,76? ]. This issue has
deliberately been avoided here, as it is charged with misleading connotations. In particular, in
EPR experiments, quantum randomness is not only inextricably connected to nonlocality, it is even
discussed as depending on it as on a necessary condition [58]. The present approach, however, is
unrelated to this question, and it is not intended to contribute in any sense to the long-standing debate
around nonlocality and hidden-variable approaches. The attempt to understand quantum randomness
within the established framework of non-relativistic unitary quantum time evolution is intended to fill
one of the last gaps where it could appear incomplete, but not to question it, let alone replace it with
hypotheses reviving classical locality.
Yet it cannot be denied that it has implications also for the interpretation of EPR experiments.
Should it be the case that the meter has an impact on individual spin measurements, how then can
spontaneous correlations arise between simultaneous measurements on spin pairs with a space-like
separation? A possible answer could lie in the assumption that the nonlocal common state of the
measured spin pair is coupled to, thus gets entangled with, the initial states of both meters, in a similar
way as a single spin supposedly probes the state of a single meter. The coupling to the nonlocal spin
state would then indirectly also entangle the states of the two apparatuses with one another, even if
they remain separated by a space-like distance. However, this question should be relegated to future

Entropy 2018, xx, 5

35 of 41

research as a particularly intriguing subject, to be addressed once the basic questions raised in this
proposal have been settled.
5. Conclusions
The present report spans a wide arc, from minimalist models of chaos inspired by card shuffling,
through pseudo-chaotic behaviour in pixelated spaces, through the quantum death of classical chaos,
through spin measurement. These diverse subjects do have a common denominator. They allow to
peek, from a macroscopic observation platform, into details of information processing on the smallest
scales, directing attention to a few essential aspects: fundamental limits of total information supply
and storage density on these scales, “vertical” information currents interchanging entropy with large
scales, “horizontal" exchange of entropy with adjacent degrees of freedom of the environment.
They are relevant in particular for an understanding of stochastic processes, collectively perceived
as “randomness”, on the macroscopic level. The analysis presented here supports the view that they
form windows to the microscopic world, exceptional points where information is not dumped into, but
lifted up from small scales, like hot magma ascending from the Earth’s mantle that reaches the surface
in volcanic eruptions. While this idea may be little more than a helpful metaphor in the context of
classical chaos, it suggests surprising consequences if applied to a seemingly unrelated field, quantum
measurement. The randomness generated in quantum measurement can be seen in a similar spirit
as resulting from an instability of the coupled object-meter system as it evolves towards alternative
measurement results. If it can be evidenced that also here, it is information exchanged with the meter
that becomes manifest in the measurement result, that would suggest an interpretation of quantum
randomness as amplified vacuum fluctuations, rather than an irreducible fundamental feature of
quantum systems.
An interpretation and extrapolation of quantum chaos in this sense is but a single example of
the fruitfulness of studying quantum phenomena in terms of information currents. This approach,
originating in and inspired by the success of quantum information science applied to computing, is
developing into an active research area of its own right, with applications in quantum optics, quantum
many-body physics, and other areas waiting to be explored.
While entropy and information currents have proven invaluable tools to understand classical
and quantum chaos, the discussion of randomness in quantum measurement reveals a significant
shortcoming of quantum entropy as an analytical instrument: It is insensitive to the difference between
ordered strings and random strings. Intuitively, a structural criterion for randomness should also
be reflected in a suitable entropy measure for quantum processes, as it is indeed addressed on the
classical level, notably in the context of algorithmic complexity [77–80].

where the operator-valued vector function F̂(t00 , t0 ) maps phase-space points r0 at time t0 along their
trajectory till t00 . Conversely, F̂−1 (t00 , t0 ) traces phase-space vectors back along their trajectory from t00

It suggests itself to change the integration variable from the “new” phase-space coordinate r00 to the
“old” one r0 , involving the Jacobian determinant det(∂r00 /∂r0 ). The (2 f × 2 f )-matrix M, also known as

In the framework of Hamiltonian mechanics, F̂ must be canonical, which requires that M complies
with the symplectic condition Mt J M = J, J denoting the symplectic unit matrix [25]. For the Jacobian,

it means that det( M ) = 1. This allows to rewrite the integration in Eq. (A5) as,

The conservation of information in classical Hamiltonian dynamics, manifest in Eq. (A7), evidently is
a lemma of symplectic phase-space volume conservation under canonical transformations [25]. It is
also as general: For example, it extends unconditionally also to systems driven by a time-dependent
external potential force, which typically do not conserve energy.

Appendix B. Entropy conservation under quantum unitary time evolution
As the most general measure of the information content of the state of a quantum system,
described by the density operator ρ̂(t), define the von-Neumann entropy,
I (t) = −c Tr[ρ̂(t) ln(ρ̂(t))].

(A8)

Based on the density operator, this definition readily covers time evolutions that include incoherent
processes, such as dissipation or measurement. In the special case of a unitary time evolution, generated
by a Hamiltonian Ĥ (t) (that may well depend on time), the density operator evolves according to the
von-Neumann equation [81]

The decisive argument in this derivation is evidently that unitary transformations leave the trace of
transformed operators invariant, in direct analogy to the conservation of phase-space volume under
canonical transformations that guarantees entropy conservation in classical Hamiltonian dynamics, cf.
