AUTOMATIC DISCOVERY OF IRRATIONALITY PROOFS AND
IRRATIONALITY MEASURES
DORON ZEILBERGER AND WADIM ZUDILIN
Dedicated to Bruce Berndt (b. March 13, 1939), on his 80 43 -th birthday
Abstract. We illustrate the power of Experimental Mathematics and Symbolic
Computation to suggest irrationality proofs of natural constants, and the determination of their irrationality measures. Sometimes such proofs can be fully automated, but sometimes there is still need for a human touch.

The Maple packages. This article is accompanied by four Maple packages:
• ALLADI.txt: a Maple package, inspired by the article [1]. It does an automated redux of Theorem 1 in their paper, and extends their results to
proving
R 1 irrationality, and finding irrationality measures, of constants of the
form 0 1/P (x) dx, where P (x) is a quadratic polynomial with integer coefficients.
• GAT.txt: a Maple package
includes the former case, but generalizes it
R 1 that
1
to integrals of the form 0 a+xk dx, where a and k are positive integers.
• BEUKERS.txt: a Maple package for getting integer linear combinations of 1,
DiLog(a/(a−1))), and Log(a/(a−1)) that are very small, for integers a ≥ 2.
• SALIKHOV.txt: a Maple package that generalizes V. Kh. Salikhov’s method
[11] to discover and prove linear independence measure of {1, log(a/(a + 1)),
log(b/(b + 1))} for most pairs of integers 2 ≤ a < b, in particular for {1,
log(a/(a + 1)), log((a + 1)/(a + 2))} for all a ≥ 1.
They are available, along with numerous output files, in the form of computergenerated articles, from the following url:

Preface: Roger Apéry’s Astounding Proof (and Bruce Berndt’s Seminar
Talk) and the Almkvist–Zeilberger algorithm. In 1978, 64-year-old
P∞ 1 Roger
Apéry, announced, and sketched, an amazing proof that ζ(3) =
n=1 n3 is an
irrational number. Some of the details were filled in by Henri Cohen and Don
Zagier, and the completed proof was the subject of Alf van der Poorten’s classic [9].
One of us (DZ) first learned about this proof from an excellent talk by Bruce
Berndt, delivered at the University of Illinois, way back in Fall 1979 (when DZ
had his third postdoc). Hence it is appropriate that we dedicate the present paper

to Bruce Berndt, since it deals with irrationality of constants inspired by Apéry’s
seminal proof, exposited so lucidly by Bruce Berndt.
Another leitmotif of the present paper is the Almkvist–Zeilberger algorithm. Gert
Almkvist and Bruce Berndt co-authored a classic expository paper [2] that won a
prestigious MAA Lester Ford award in 1988. Since Gert Almkvist (1934–2018) was
also a good friend, and long-time collaborator, of the second-named author (WZ),
and both authors are good friends and admirers of Bruce Berndt, it is more than
fitting to dedicate this article to Bruce Berndt.
Apéry’s proof of the Irrationality of ζ(3). Roger Apéry (see [9]) pulled out of
a hat two explicit sequences of rational numbers. The first sequence consisted only
of integers,
2
n  2 
X
n+k
n
,
bn :=
k
k
k=0
while the second one was a sequence of rational numbers,

It was easy to check that pn := lcm(1, . . . , n)3 an are integers and, of course,√ qn :=
2)−3
√
=
lcm(1, . . . , n)3 bn are integers. Then he came up with a real number δ = 44 log(1+
log(1+ 2)+3
0.080259 . . . > 0 such that for some constant C (independent of n)
ζ(3) −

Once all the claims are verified, it follows that ζ(3) is irrational. Indeed, if ζ(3) would
have been rational with denominator c, the left side would have been bounded below
by cq1n . It also follows that an irrationality measure (see [9]) is bounded above by
1 + 1δ = 12.417820 . . . .
Frits Beukers’ Version. Shortly after, Frits Beukers [5] gave a much simpler
rendition of Apéry’s construction by introducing a certain explicit triple integral
n
Z 1Z 1Z 1 
dx dy dz
x(1 − x)y(1 − y)z(1 − z)
,
I(n) =
1 − (1 − xy)z

and pointing out that

√
(i) I(n) is small and can be explicitly bounded: I(n) = O(( 2 − 1)4n );
(ii) I(n) = A(n) + B(n)ζ(3) for certain sequences of rational numbers A(n),
B(n), that can be explicitly bounded; and
(iii) A(n) lcm(1, . . . , n)3 and B(n) lcm(1, . . . , n)3 are integers.
Since, thanks to the Prime Number Theorem lcm(1, . . . , n) is Ω(en ), everything
followed.
(We use the convenient notation F (n) = Ω(cn ) meaning limn→∞ (log F (n))/n = c.)

Shortly after, Krishna Alladi and M. L. Robinson, used one-dimensional analogs to
reprove the irrationality of log 2, and established an upper bound for its irrationality
measure of 4.63 (subsequently improved, see [13]) by considering the simple integral

like 0 1−t2 dt its inverse function, in this case sin x, is much more user-friendly.
We understand Jacobi’s quip in a different way. Rather than start with a famous
constant, say ζ(3) or log 2, and wreck our brains trying to find Beukers-like or Alladi–
Robinson-like integrals that would produce good diophantine approximations, start
with a family of integrals I(n), and see
• whether I(0) is a familiar constant, let’s call it x;
• whether I(n), for integers n > 0, can be written as A(n) − B(n)x, with
{A(n)} and {B(n)} sequences of rational numbers;
• whether I(n) has exponential decay, i.e. is ‘small’;

Since A(n) − B(n)x is so close to 0, B(n)
is very close to x. Write B(n)
as B

where now A (n) and B (n) are integers. How close is A(n)/B(n) = A (n)/B ′ (n)
to x, from a diophantine (rather than numerical-analysis) point of view?
We are looking for what we call ‘empirical delta’, let’s call it δ(n), such that

in other words, we define
δ(n) :=

− 1.

If the values of δ(n) for, say 990 ≤ n ≤ 1000 are all strictly positive, and safely not
too close to 0, then we can be assured that there exists a proof of irrationality, and
a corresponding rigorous upper bound for its irrationality measure.
But being sure that a proof exists is not the same as having one. It would be nice
to have a fully rigorous proof. First, try to find one yourself, and you are welcome
to get help from your computer, that excels not only in number-crunching, but also
in symbol-crunching, but is still not so good in idea-crunching (although it is getting
better and better!).
If you are stuck, you can always email an expert number-theorist and offer him
or her to collaborate with you on the paper
“Proof of the irrationality of x”.
If x was not yet proved to be irrational, and furthermore is sufficiently famous (e.g.
Euler’s constant, γ, or Catalan’s constant, G) you and your collaborator would be
famous too (that what happened to Apéry). If the constant in question is complicated and obscure, it is still publishable, at least in the arXiv. If x is already proved
to be irrational, and there is currently a proved upper bound for the irrationality

measure of x and the implied (rigorous) bound from your sequence A(n)/B(n) is
better (i.e. smaller) than the previous one, you (and your expert collaborator) can
write a paper
“A new upper bound for the irrationality measure of x”,
and you (and your expert collaborator) would be known as the current holders of
the world record of the irrationality measure of x, until someone else, in turn, would
break your record.
In this paper we will show how, using the amazing Almkvist–Zeilberger algorithm
[3] that finds (and at the same time, proves!) a linear recurrence equation with
polynomial coefficients for such integrals I(n), one can accomplish the first four
steps (that we call reconnaissance) very fast and very efficiently, and sometimes
(but not always!) the last ‘rigorous’, step, can also be automated.

The Almkvist–Zeilberger algorithm [3] produces a linear recurrence equation
with polynomial coefficients satisfied by I(n):
(n + 2) I (n) + (−6 n − 9) I (n + 1) + (n + 1) I (n + 2) = 0.

From this we can compute, very fast, many values, and find out the ‘empirical
deltas’. For example,
1827083538922494024488153994990786998947102154393958429773
I(50) = −

+ 15310086199495855930932559804210504653 ln (2) .
This implies the rational approximation to log 2 (by ‘pretending’ that I(50) is zero)
of
1827083538922494024488153994990786998947102154393958429773

2635924360893339481850468164186010894239049450495548604400
whose empirical delta is
0.33269846131126944438 . . .

.

This is encouraging! But we can’t judge from just one data point. We next find
that the ‘empirical deltas’ for n = 51 and n = 53 are 0.31992792581569268673 . . .
and 0.30031107795443952791 . . . , respectively. To get more confidence, we need to
go to higher values of n. The lowest empirical delta between n = 990 and n = 1000
turns out to be
0.28193333613008344616 . . . ,
that is not as good, but is way above 0. It leads to an estimate for the irrationality
measure of 4.5469377751717949058 . This trend persists, so we can be convinced
that the integral I(n) is promising. But this is not yet a rigorous proof.
Writing I(n) = A(n) + B(n) log(2), the next step is to (automatically!) find the
rate of growth of A(n) and B(n). The original proof in [1] used partial fractions,

AUTOMATIC DISCOVERY OF IRRATIONALITY PROOFS

and the saddle-point method, but thanks to the Poincaré lemma (see [9]) we can do
it very fast and automatically.
Note that A(n) and B(n) satisfy the same recurrence. In other words,
(n + 2) A (n) + (−6 n − 9) A (n + 1) + (n + 1) A (n + 2) = 0,

(n + 2) B (n) + (−6 n − 9) B (n + 1) + (n + 1) B (n + 2) = 0.

The ‘constant-coefficient approximation’ of the above recurrence is (taking the leading coefficient in n, that happens to be n1 = n)
Ā (n) − 6Ā (n + 1) + Ā (n + 2) = 0 ,

where Ā(n) is an approximation to A(n) that Poincaré proved has the property that
log Ā(n)
= 1,
n→∞ log A(n)
lim

and similarly for B(n) and B̄(n). The indicial equation of this constant-coefficient
linear recurrence is
1 − 6N + N 2 = 0,
whose roots are
√
√
a = 3 + 2 2, b = 3 − 2 2.
It follows that |A(n)|, |B(n)| = Ω(an ) and that |I(n)| = Ω(bn ), since I(n) is obviously the sub-dominant solution, of exponential decay. There is only one problem, A(n) is not an integer. The computer can easily check, empirically that
A′ (n) := lcm(1, . . . , n)A(n) is an integer for 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, and then try to prove it
in general (or get a little help from a human friend). Then defining
A′ (n) = lcm(1, . . . , n)A(n),

B ′ (n) = lcm(1, . . . , n)B(n),

I ′ (n) = lcm(1, . . . , n)I(n),

we have that A′ (n), B ′ (n) are integers. By the Prime Number Theorem, lcm(1, . . . , n) =
Ω(en ), hence
|A′ (n)|, B ′ (n) = Ω(an en ), |I ′ (n)| = Ω(bn en ).
Since we want

|I ′ (n)| =

This has been improved several times [13], first by Ekaterina Rukhadze [10] (see also
[14]); the current record of 3.57455391 is due to Raffaele Marcovecchio [7].
The novelty of our approach is that it can be taught to a computer, and everything,
except possibly proving the ‘divisibility lemma’ (that in this case is extremely simple,
but in other cases is not so simple).

Using this method, our computer, Shalosh B. Ekhad, proved ab initio, all by itself
(except the simple divisibility lemma) Theorem 1 of [1]. Note that nowhere did
we mention Legendre polynomials (they turned, in hindsight, to be unnecessary).
Furthermore, our approach is streamlined, and the formulation of the theorem is
more explicit.
Theorem (Alladi–Robinson [1], but with a more explicit formulation). Let a and

They were “cherry-picked” from the ‘candidate pool’ of 0 1/(a + bx + cx ) dx with
1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10, with gcd(a, b, c) = 1 that consisted of 841 ‘applicants’, and naturally
we only listed our successes. Of course, all such constants are already proved to be
irrational by heavy-artillery theorems (for example the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem), but these theorems do not give explicit bounds for the irrationality measure,
and may be ineffective.

students.

The Maple packages GAT.txt and BEUKERS.txt. The Maple package GAT.txt
did not produce (so far) anything exciting, so we don’t talk about it here, but the
readers are welcome to explore it on their own.
So far, all our integrals were one-dimensional. The Maple package BEUKERS.txt
tries to tweak Frits Beukers’ elegant proof ]B] of the irrationality of ζ(2), by trying
to see what happens when you look at the double integral
n

The original case of a = 1 gave an irrationality proof (and measure) for ζ(2) =
π /6, and indeed E(0, 1) = ζ(2). The recurrence for E(n, 1) is second-order (the
same one for which Apéry proved the irrationality of ζ(2)). However, things get
more complicated for higher a.
Since E(0, a) = a dilog((a − 1)/a) we hoped that considering the above double
integral would yield irrationality proofs for them. Alas, E(n, a) gets ‘contaminated’
with log((a − 1)/a), and it turns out that
2

E(n, a) = A(n, a) + B(n, a) dilog((a − 1)/a) + C(n, a) log((a − 1)/a) ,

for all n, for three sequences of rational numbers {A(n, a)}, {B(n, a)}, {C(n, a)}.
This can be proved directly, but it follows immediately from the fact that it is true
for n = 0, 1, 2, and that E(n, a) , and hence A(n, a), B(n, a), C(n, a), satisfy the
third-order linear recurrence equation
− a3 (n + 1)2 (a − 1) (32 na + 76 a − 27 n − 66) E(n, a)

+ (32 na + 44 a − 27 n − 39) (3 + n)2 E(n + 3, a) = 0.

This complicated recurrence was obtained using the Apagodu–Zeilberger multivariable Almkvist–Zeilberger algorithm [4].
Using this recurrence we proved that for every integer a ≥ 2, there exists a
positive δ = δ(a) and three sequences of integers C1 (n, a), C2 (n, a), C3 (n, a) such
that

The explicit expression for δ(a) is complicated and we refer the reader to the
computer-generated article
http://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~ zeilberg/tokhniot/oBEUKERS1.txt ,
that contains a fully rigorous proof of this theorem. If we did not know that

8

log((a − 1)/a) was irrational, this theorem would have implied that dilog((a − 1)/a)
and log((a − 1)/a)) can not be both rational. It is not enough, by itself, to prove
the linear independence of {1, log((a − 1)/a), dilog((a − 1)/a)}, but some human
modification of it makes the things work well — see the latest achievements in this
direction, together with historical notes, in the wonderful paper [12] of Georges Rhin
and Carlo Viola.
The Maple package SALIKHOV.txt. We are most proud of this last Maple package, since it generated a new theorem that should be of interest to ‘mainstream’,
human mathematicians. It was obtained by generalizing V. Kh. Salikhov’s proof [11]
of the linear independence of {1, log 2, log 3}. Our computer proved the following
theorem.
Theorem. For any positive integer a, the set of three numbers {1, log(a/(a + 1)),
log((a + 1)/(a + 2))} are linearly independent. In other words there exists a positive
number, ν(a), such that if q,p1 ,p2 are integers and Q = max(|q|, |p1 |, |p2 |) , Q ≥ Q0 ,
where Q0 is a sufficiently large number, then
|q + p1 log(a/(a + 1)) + p2 log((a + 1)/(a + 2))| >

Qν(a)

.

The full proof is in the following article
http://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~ zeilberg/tokhniot/oSALIKHOV2.txt ,
where an exact expression for ν(a) can be found (see also below). The theorem was
previously known to be true for a ≥ 53 by Masayoshi Hata [6] (recently improved,
though somewhat implicitly, by Volodya Lysov to a ≥ 32).
Because of the novelty, we choose this result to feature some human-generated
highlights of the proof. The integrals

Conclusion. Humans, no matter how smart, can only go so far. Machines, no
matter how fast, can also only go so far. The future of mathematics depends on a
fruitful symbiosis of the strong points of both species, as we hoped we demonstrated
in this modest tribute to Bruce Berndt.
