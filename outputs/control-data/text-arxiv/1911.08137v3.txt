Abstract. For finite dimensional free Cp -spaces, the calculation of the Bredon cohomology ring as an algebra over the cohomology of S 0 is used to prove the non-existence of
certain Cp -maps. These are related to Borsuk-Ulam type theorems, and equivariant maps
related to the topological Tverberg conjecture. For certain finite dimensional Cp -spaces
which are formed out of representations, it is proved that the cohomology is a free module
over the cohomology of a point. All the calculations are done for the cohomology with
constant coefficients Z/p.

1. Introduction
For the cyclic group Cp of prime order p, computations of RO(G)-graded cohomology
by Stong and Lewis [16] allow us to compute the cohomology of Cp -spaces. In
this paper, we prove some structural results about the cohomology of Cp -spaces with Z/p
coefficients. In many ways, Z/p is the analogue of Z/p-coefficients in ordinary cohomology
in the non-equivariant case.
For coefficients in a constant Mackey functor, the integer graded cohomology is the
cohomology of the orbit space. If X is a Cp -space with free action, we prove that the
RO(G)-graded cohomology is determined from the cohomology of the orbit space. More
precisely,
HC⋆p (X; Z/p) ∼
= H ∗ (X/Cp ) ⊗ξ∈Cˆp −{1} Z/p[u±
ξ ]
0
H⋆
G (S )

where Ĉp is set of characters of Cp (see Proposition 3.2).
We also compute the module structure of HC⋆p (X; Z/p) over the cohomology of a point
(see Proposition 3.11). The module structure allows us to rule out certain equivariant maps
between free Cp -spaces. More precisely, we deduce Borsuk-Ulam type theorems [14] : If V
and V ′ are two fixed point free Cp -representations, there are no Cp -maps S(V ) → S(V ′ )
if dim(V ) > dim(V ′ ) (see Corollary 4.3). The module structure calculations also allow us
to deduce the topological Tverberg conjecture in the prime case, first proved by Bárány,
Shlosman, and Szücs [1] (see Theorem 4.5).
If X is a finite dimensional free Cp -space, we use the module structure to obtain a
0
numerical bound n(X) such that for every i > n(X) the elements of H ⋆
G (S ) of degree i
⋆
operate trivially on H G (X+ ). This number is related to the Fadell-Husseini index [5] (see
Theorem 4.6).
We also prove a freeness result for certain Cp -spaces. This kind of theorem writes the
cohomology of X as a free module over the cohomology of a point, for certain G-complexes
formed out of cells in unitary G-representations. In ordinary cohomology, with Z-coefficients
this is true if X has even dimensional cells, and with Z/p coefficients this is true for any X.
For the group Cp , Lewis [16] proved a freeness result for certain even dimensional complexes.
There is a condition on the fixed points to deduce that the attaching maps induce the 0

map on cohomology. For this theorem, only the additive structure of the RO(Cp )-graded
cohomology of S 0 is used.
Ferland and Lewis [7] use the ring structure of the RO(Cp )-graded cohomology of S 0 to
remove the condition on the fixed points. They show that for any Cp -cell complex formed
out of representations with even cells, the cohomology is a free module over the cohomology
of S 0 . In this case, the attaching maps do not induce the 0 map on cohomology but it is
proved that the cohomology of the cofibre is still free. This crucially uses the ring structure
0
of H ⋆
Cp (S ).
Kronholm [15] has proved that any C2 -space obtained inductively by attaching representation cells in increasing dimension (called Rep(C2 )-complexes), the cohomology is a free
module over the cohomology of a point when the coefficients are Z/2. This also involves
0
a careful analysis using the ring structure of H ⋆
C2 (S ; Z/2). In this paper, we make the
analogous analysis for Cp where p > 2, and prove that for certain Rep(Cp )-complexes, the
cohomology is free as a module over the cohomology of a point when the coefficients are
Z/p. It is important to note here that the direct generalization does not work in the p odd
case, due to an example of Clover May (see Remark 4.9). We prove the theorem in the case
where the complex does not have cells in consecutive dimension (see Theorem 4.20).

1.1. Organization. In Section 2, we recall some definitions and results from RO(G)-graded
Bredon cohomology theory. We use these methods to write down the cohomology of free
Cp -spaces in Section 3. In Section 4, we describe some applications such as the proof of the
topological Tverberg conjecture in the prime case, and a freeness theorem for representation
complexes.
1.2. Acknowledgements. The authors would like to thank Clover May for pointing out
the conterexample (Remark 4.9) regarding an error in an earlier version of the paper. The
research of the first author was supported by SERB MATRICS grant number 2018/000845.
2. Preliminaries
We recall certain basic ideas and techniques in Bredon cohomology. Along the way we fix
the notations used throughout the paper. The details and proofs of the stated facts may be
found in [19]. The notation G will be used for the cyclic group Cp of prime order p, though
most of the facts in this section also holds for a general finite group.
For a orthogonal representation V of the group G, let D(V ) and S(V ) denote the unit
disc and unit representation sphere in V, with the action induced from that of V . A G-CW
complex is a G-space X with a filtration {X (n) }n≥0 , where X (0) is a disjoint union of Gorbits, and X (n) is obtained from X (n−1) by attaching cells of the form G×H D n along maps
G ×H S n−1 → X (n−1) where H ≤ G and the action of G on D n and S n−1 are trivial. The
space X (n) is defined as the nth -skelelon of X. The attaching map G ×H S n−1 → X (n−1)
is equivalent to the map S n−1 → (X (n−1) )H = (X H )(n−1) . One may deduce that the
category of G-CW complexes is equivalent to the functor category from OG to the category
of CW-complexes, where OG is the orbit category of G with objects are the finite G-sets
and morphisms are the G-equivariant maps between G-sets.
A coefficient system for the group G is a contravariant functor from OG to the category of
abelian groups. Since this diagram category from OG to the abelian group category is an additive category, therefore, we can talk about chains of coefficient systems. In particular, for
a G-space we define the Bredon chain, C ∗ (X; Z), given by assignment G/H → C∗ (X H ; Z).
Definition 2.1. Let M be a coefficient system for a group G and X be a G-space. Define the
n (X; M ) = Hom
nth -Bredon cochains of X with coefficients in M as CG
OG (C n (X, Z); M ).

The cohomology of this complex is defined as Z-graded Bredon cohomology of X with
∗ (X; M ).
coefficients in M and denoted by HG
Equivariant homotopy and cohomology theories are more naturally graded on RO(G),
the Grothendieck group of finite real orthogonal representations of G. To obtain this kind
of theory one needs more structure on the coefficient systems. These are called Mackey
functors.
Definition 2.2. A Mackey functor consists of a pair M = (M ∗ , M ∗ ) of functors from the
category of finite G-sets to Ab, with M ∗ covariant and M ∗ contravariant. On every object
S, M ∗ and M ∗ have the same value which we denote by M (S), and M carries disjoint
unions to direct sums. The functors are required to satisfy that for every pullback diagram
of finite G-sets as below

one has M (α) ◦ M ∗ (β) = M ∗ (δ) ◦ M (γ).
Mackey functors are naturally contravariant functors from the Burnside category BurnG
of G to abelian groups. The objects of BurnG are finite G-sets and the morphisms are
formed by group completing the monoid of correspondences. The representable functor
associated to the G-set G/G is called the Burnside ring Mackey functor A. For a finite
G-set S, AS is the representable functor associated to S.
Example 2.3. For an abelian group C, an immediate example for a Mackey functor is
the constant Mackey functor C defined by the assignment C(S) = Map G (S, C), the set of
G-maps from the G-orbit S to C with trivial G-action.
Equivariant cohomology theories are represented by G-spectra. The naive G-spectra
are those in which only the desuspension with respect to trivial G-spheres are allowed.
Usually, what we mean by G-spectra are those in which desuspension with respect to all
representation spheres are allowed. In the viewpoint of [17], naive G-spectra are indexed
over a trivial G-universe and G-spectra are indexed over a complete G-universe. As we
are allowed to take desuspension with respect to representation-spheres, the associated
cohomology theories become RO(G)-graded.
We consider the orthogonal G-spectra with positive complete model structure to model
the equivariant stable homotopy theory, which can be read off from [12, Appendix A, B]. In
particular, SpG denotes the symmetric model category of orthogonal G-spectra. We denote
the homotopy class of maps by [−, −]G and the equivariant function spectrum F (−, −), a
right adjoint to the smash product ∧ in SpG .
Every G-set S gives a suspension spectrum Σ∞
G S+ in the category of G-spectra. It turns
out that the category with finite G-sets as objects and homotopy classes of spectra maps as
morphisms is naturally isomorphic to the Burnside category. Thus, the homotopy groups
of G-spectra are naturally Mackey functors. For an equivariant orthogonal spectrum X, we
use π⋆ (X) for its RO(G)-graded homotopy groups. In particular, for α = V − W ∈ RO(G),
πα (X) = [S V , S W ∧ X]G .
In non-equivariant homotopy theory, for each abelian group A, there is a construction of
the Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectra HA satisfying

In the category of orthogonal spectra, one also has a construction of Eilenberg-Mac Lane
spectra for each Mackey functor.
Proposition 2.4. Let M be a G-Mackey functor. Then there exist an equivariant EilenbergMac Lane spectrum HM , unique up to homotopy in SpG .
Proof. See [10, Theorem 5.3].



This implies a definition of RO(G)-graded homotopy groups of Equivariant EilenbergMac Lane spectra which, unlike the integer graded ones, are non-trivial in infinitely many
degrees. In fact, equivariant Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectra must arise from Mackey functors.
This is a theorem of Lewis, May, and McClure which we refer from Chapter XIII of [19].
Therefore, we may argue that the integer-graded cohomology associated to coefficient systems extends to RO(G)-graded cohomology theories if and only if the coefficient system has
an underlying Mackey functor structure.
Definition 2.5. An RO(G)-graded cohomology theory consists of functors E α for α ∈
RO(G), from reduced equivariant CW complexes to abelian groups which satisfy the usual
axioms - homotopy invariance, excision, long exact sequence and the wedge axiom.
It is interesting to note that the suspension isomorphism for RO(G)-graded cohomology
theories takes the form E α (X) ∼
= E α+V (S V ∧ X) for every based G-space X and representation V .
We recall that there are change of groups functors on equivariant spectra. The restriction
functor from G-spectra to H-spectra has a left adjoint given by smashing with G/H+ . This
also induces an isomorphism on cohomology with Mackey functor coefficients
H̃ α (G/H+ ∧ X; M ) ∼
= H̃ α (X; res H (M ))
H

G

The RO(G)-graded theories may also be assumed to be Mackey functor-valued as in the
definition below.
Definition 2.6. Let X be a pointed G-space, M be any Mackey functor, α ∈ RO(G).
Then the Mackey functor valued cohomology H αG (X; M ) is defined as
α
H αG (X; M )(G/K) = H̃G
(G/K + ∧ X; M ).

The restriction and transfer maps are induced by the appropriate maps of G-spectra.
The Mackey functor valued cohomology is always the reduced version, so we may only
evaluate it on a pointed G-space. This means that we have G-invariant basepoint. On
the other hand, the Bredon cohomology groups are defined for unpointed G-spaces also, so
when we write the reduced version we put ∼ as a superscript. This explains our notation
⋆
in the rest of the document where we use the notation H̃G
(X+ ).
The next natural question is : What is the structure on a Mackey functor which induces
a ring structure on the cohomology of spaces? There is a box product ✷ on the category of
Mackey functors. For two Mackey functors M , N , this is obtained by taking the left Kan
extension along

3. Cohomology of free Cp -spaces
In this section, we compute the Bredon cohomology of free Cp -spaces. There are two
ingredients in this, first the ring structure on the cohomology and second the module structure over the cohomology of a point. The former is computed in Section 3.1, and the latter
⋆
in Section 3.3. Along the way we also describe the method to compute H̃G
(S 0 ) using the
Tate square, to recalculate the computations by Stong and Lewis [16].
3.1. The cohomology ring structure. Let X be a free G-space. We prove that the
cohomology ring of X is obtained in a neat way from the ordinary cohomology of X/G.
For this purpose, we set up a spectral sequence to compute the Bredon cohomology of a
free G-space X arising from a CW structure on X, which we then proceed to compute
completely. This is the homotopy fixed point spectral sequence in the case X = EG in [13,
Proposition 2.8].
We start with a G-CW structure on X as X = ∪s X (s) . Since X is free the cells are of
the type G/e × D k . We also note that X/G has a CW complex structure with associated
filtration X (s) /G. Thus, we have

In the case p odd, all the representation spheres are orientable so that the action of G on
πt (S − dim(α) ∧ HZ/p) is trivial. In the case p = 2, also the action of G on πt (S − dim(α) ∧
HZ/2) ∼
= Z/2 is trivial. It follows that the boundary d1 matches with the cellular coboundary. Therefore, we have proved the following result.
Proposition 3.1. There is a spectral sequence
G
E2s,t (α) = H s (X/G; πt (S − dim(α) ∧ HZ/p)) ⇒ πα+t−s
(F (X+ , HZ/p))

with boundary dr : Ers,t (α) → Ers+r,t−r+1 (α). The spectral sequences assemble together for
various α into a multiplicative RO(G)-graded spectral sequence
G
E2s,α = H s (X/G; π0 (S − dim(α) ∧ HZ/p)) ⇒ πα−s
(F (X+ , HZ/p))

where s ∈ Z and α ∈ RO(G).

The multiplicative structure of the spectral sequence follows verbatim from [4, Theorem
6.1] applied to X instead of EG. We readily deduce that for every α, the spectral sequence
E2s,t (α) is concentrated at t = − dim(α). Therefore, the spectral sequences degenerate at
the second page. Also, the multiplicative structure on the spectral sequence in Proposition
3.1 implies that everything is a product of the form H s (X/G) ⊗ π0 (S dim(α) ∧ HZ/p). Now

π0 (S dim(α) ∧ HZ/p) fits together as a ring

unambiguous.

In homotopy grading, uW ∈ π n−W (HZ/p)(G/G). We also denote its dual by uW in

fix the notation ξ for this representation. In the calculation of H̃G
(S 0 ; Z/p) ∼
= π−⋆ HZ/p,
one notes that it suffices to restrict ⋆ to the values m + nξ with m, n ∈ Z. For, one may
observe from [6, Appendix B] that S α ∧ HZ/p ≃ HZ/p whenever both the dimension of α
i

and the dimension of αG are 0. It follows that S ξ−ξ ∧ HZ/p ≃ HZ/p, so that there are
invertible classes in the graded commutative ring π⋆ HZ/p in degrees ξ i − ξ, which makes

Proposition 3.9. The action of the Bockstein β on H̃G
(S ) is given by the formula

β(κξ ) = aξ , β(uξ ) = 0, β(uσ ) = aσ , β(aξ ) = 0, β(aσ ) = 0.
Proof. Observe from the computations in Propositions 3.8 and 3.6 that the map q ∗ :

(S 0 ) → H̃G
(EG+ ) is injective on the top cone, so that we may prove the relations
in the statement either in the cohomology of S 0 or in the cohomology of EG+ . We know
that the Bockstein homomorphism is a derivation. Therefore, we have
β(κξ ) = β(uξ x) = β(uξ )x + uξ β(x).
So in order to prove the first equality, it is enough to check that β(uξ ) = 0. Note that for

Hence, we have π∗ (uξ ) = uξ . This yields the Bockstein sends the class uξ to zero. Therefore,
we obtain β(κξ ) = aξ . This completes the proof for p odd.
In the case p = 2, we again use the fact that β is a derivation and β 2 = 0, so that it suffices
to verify that β(uσ ) = aσ . We directly compute a cell structure on S σ as S 0 ∪C2 /e×D 1 with
the boundary map generated by identity which may be identified as C2 /e × S 0 → pt × S 0 .
Therefore, the reduced Bredon homology with constant coefficients Z/k is computed by the
two term cell complex
2
Z/k → Z/k
as the differential is generated by the transfer map which is multiplication by 2. Directly comparing the answers for k = 2 and k = 4, we see that the map H1 (S σ ; Z/4) →

H1 (S σ ; Z/2) is 0. Hence it follows that uσ does not lie in the image of HG

3.3. Module structure of H̃G
(X+ ; Z/p). In this section, we compute the H̃G
(S ; Z/p)⋆
module structure of H̃G
(X+ ; Z/p). Note that this is determined by the action of the
elements uσ , aσ for p = 2, and uξ , κξ and aξ for p odd. We write q : X+ → S 0 for
⋆
(S 0 ; Z/p) act
the map which quotients out X to a single point. Then, the elements in H̃G
via multiplication by their images under q ∗ which is a ring map. Therefore it suffices to
compute the images of the generators under q ∗ . We have already done this for X = EG.
Hence, we readily obtain
⋆
(S 0 ; Z/p)
Proposition 3.10. 1) Let p be an odd prime. Then the action of aξ , uξ ∈ H̃G
⋆
2
on H̃G (EG+ ; Z/p) ∼
= Z/p[x, aξ , u±
ξ ]/(x ) is given by multiplication by the corresponding
elements. The action of κξ equals multiplication by xuξ .

2) Let p = 2. Then the action of aσ , uσ ∈ H̃G
(S 0 ; Z/2) on H̃G

Next we consider a general free G-space X, which is non-equivariantly connected. We
know that if X had some point with a non-trivial stabilizer, then S 0 becomes an equivariant
⋆
retract of X+ , so the map q ∗ identifies H̃G
(X+ ; Z/p) as a subring which is included in
⋆
G ; Z/p). So we restrict our attention to the free case, where X → X/G is a covering
H̃G
(X+
space with G acting on X by Deck transformations. This induces a homomorphism τ :
π1 (X/G) → G ∼
= Z/p, which is well-defined up to a unit in Z/p. This gives an element of
H̃ 1 (X/G; Z/p) which we also denote by τ . We now have the following Proposition regarding

= H ∗ (X/G; Z/2) ⊗
Z/2[u±
σ ] is given by multiplication by the corresponding element. The action of aσ is given
by multiplication by τ uσ .
Proof. We already know the action of uξ (and uσ in the case p = 2) from the calculation
in Proposition 3.2. For proving the rest, we determine the images of κξ and aξ . If p > 2,
the action of aξ follows from the action of κξ using the Bockstein as in Proposition 3.9.
Now, consider the projection map q : X+ → S 0 and its homotopy cofibre C(q). As X
is (non-equivariantly) connected, it readily follows that C(q) is non-equivariantly simply
connected.
For 1), we claim that the induced map
ξ−1
ξ−1
(X+ ; Z/p)
(S 0 ; Z/p) → H̃G
q ∗ : H̃G

is injective. To prove the claim, it is enough to show that the group
[C(q), S ξ−1 ∧ HZ/p]G = 0.
Note that this group fits into the long exact sequence
(3.12)
· · · [C(q), Σ−1 HZ/p]G

/ [C(q), S ξ−1 ∧ HZ/p]G

/ [C(q), S(ξ)+ ∧ HZ/p]G · · ·

H̃ −1 (C(q)/G; Z/p)
associated to the cofibre sequence
S(ξ)+ → S 0 → S ξ
Since, the group in the left is zero, therefore, we only remain to prove the group [C(q), S(ξ)+ ∧
HZ/p]G vanishes. For this consider the cofibre sequence
Cp /e+ → Cp /e+ → S(ξ)+
It gives the long exact sequence
· · · [C(q), Cp /e+ ∧ HZ/p]G

H̃ 0 (C(q); Z/p)

/ [C(q), S(ξ)+ ∧ HZ/p]G

/ [C(q), ΣCp /e+ ∧ HZ/p]G · · ·

H̃ 1 (C(q); Z/p)

Since, C(q) is simply connected, therefore, [C(q), S(ξ)+ ∧ HZ/p]G = 0. Hence, using (3.12),
we obtain [C(q), S ξ−1 ∧ HZ/p]G = 0. Thus, we establish the claim. It follows that q ∗ (κξ ) =
φuξ for some φ ∈ H 1 (X/G) = Hom(π1 (X/G), Z/p) (using Proposition 3.2) which is nonzero.
Now the above is true for any free G-space. Observe that the 1-skeleton of X is a union
of copies of S 1 on which G acts by multiplication by pth roots of 1, which is equivariantly
homeomorphic to S(ξ). We, therefore, must have that φ pulls back non-trivially to the orbit
space S(ξ)/G. This is also homeomorphic to S 1 , with
H 1 (S(ξ)/G; Z/p) ∼
= Hom(π1 (S(ξ)/G), Z/p).

12

SAMIK BASU, SUROJIT GHOSH

Hence, the pullback of φ must send 1 ∈ π1 (S(ξ)/G) ∼
= Z to a unit in Z/p, and thus the
kernel is the image of π1 (S(ξ)). As this is true for every map from S(ξ) to X, the kernel of
φ must be equal to the image of π1 (X). Therefore, φ equals τ up to a unit of Z/p. We may
fix the choice of unit in the definition of τ so that φ = τ . Since the choice of φ is natural,
this choice of τ is natural among equivariant maps between free G-spaces.
For 2), consider the cofibre sequence C2 /e+ → S 0 → S σ and its associated long exact
sequence

Since C(p) is simply connected, the group [C(q), S σ ∧ HZ/2]G is trivial. Thus, the map
σ
σ

apply a similar argument as above to deduce the result.

4. Applications to finite dimensional Cp -spaces
We now restrict our attention to finite dimensional Cp -spaces, and focus on two kinds of
examples – the free case, and the case where the space is formed by attaching cells along
representation spheres. In the former case, we obtain an invariant used to prove theorems
about non-existence of equivariant maps. In the latter case, we obtain a freeness theorem
that the RO(G)-graded cohomology is a free module over the cohomology of point.
4.1. Cohomology of spheres. Let V be a fixed point free Cp -representation, that is,
V G = 0. One has the cofibre sequence
S(V )+ → S 0 → S V ,
where the map S 0 → S V induces the stable map aV . Therefore, we have the associated
long exact sequence

This allows us to compute H ⋆
Cp (S(V )+ ; Z/p) from the formula for the ring structure on
⋆
H̃G
(S 0 ; Z/p) in Propositions 3.6 and 3.8. We have the following useful Lemma.

Lemma 4.2. Let V be a fixed point free representation of Cp . Then,
H VG (S(V )+ ; Z/p) = 0.
dim(V )

Proof. For p = 2, V = dim(V )σ, and we have aV = aσ
. Proposition 3.8 now implies
0 (S 0 ) → H̃ V (S 0 ) induced by multiplication by a is an isomorphism. For p odd,
that H̃G

aV = uaξ

HZ/p ≃ HZ/p. It follows from Proposition 3.6 that H̃C0 p (S 0 ) → H̃CVp (S 0 ) induced by
multiplication by aV is an isomorphism. Now the result is implied directly by (4.1).

Lemma 4.2 allows us to conclude well-known Borsuk-Ulam type theorems [14] for G.
Corollary 4.3. Let V and V ′ be two fixed point free representations of G. Then there does
not exist G-maps from S(V ) → S(V ′ ) if dim(V ) > dim(V ′ ).

(S 0 ; Z/p) = 0, from the calculations of Propositions 3.6 and
Proof. We note that H̃G

H̃G
(S(V ′ )+ ; Z/p) → H̃G

(S 0 ; Z/p)-modules which sends 1 to 1. In degree V ′ , the left hand side is 0 by Lemma

4.2, and the right hand side is generated by 1 · aV ′ . This is a contradiction.

We may also use these techniques to deduce a proof of the “topological Tverberg conjecture” in the prime case. This states that for integers n ≥ 2, d ≥ 1 and N = (d + 1)(n − 1),
and for any continuous map f : ∆N → Rd , there exists n-pairwise disjoint faces σ1 , · · · , σn
of the simplex ∆N such that f (σ1 ) ∩ · · · ∩ f (σn ) 6= ∅. This conjecture was first posed by
Bárány, Shlosman, and Szücs [1], who proved if n is prime. Later, Özaydin [20], Sarkaria
[21], and Volvikov [22] using different techniques extended this result to n a power of some
prime. In [8], Frick describes a counterexample when n is not a prime power and d ≥ 3n + 1.
We have in earlier work observed [2] that the methods in the prime power case do not help
in proving weaker versions (that is, with increased values of N ) if n is not a prime power.
A map f : ∆(d+1)(n−1) → Rd violating the topological Tverberg conjecture gives a Σn equivariant map from the ((d + 1)(n − 1) + 1)-fold join {1, 2, · · · , n}∗((d+1)(n−1)+1) to the
representation sphere S(W ⊕d ) [20], where W is the standard representation of the symmetric
group Σn , of dimension (n − 1). For n = p, restricting to the cyclic subgroup Cp , we get
a Cp -equivariant map from {1, · · · , p}∗((d+1)(n−1)+1) to S(ρ̄⊕(d+1) ), where ρ̄ is the reduced
regular representation.
Observe that the inclusion ECp ((d+1)(p−1)) ⊆ ECp induces an isomorphism in H̃C∗ p (−, Z/p)
for ∗ ≤ (d + 1)(p − 1) − 1 and is injective for ∗ = (d + 1)(p − 1). Since this is an inclusion of free Cp -spaces the result also holds for H̃Cαp (−; Z/p) where α ∈ RO(Cp ) with
dim α ≤ (d + 1)(p − 1). In particular, observe for 1 ∈ H̃C0 p (ECp ; Z/p), Proposition 3.10
yields

Using these formulas, the following theorem provides a key step towards the topological
Tverberg conjecture in the prime case.
((p−1)(d+1))

Theorem 4.5. There does not exist any Cp -map ECp

→ S(ρ̄⊕(d+1) ).

((p−1)(d+1))

Proof. Suppose on contrary there is a Cp -map f : ECp
induces a H̃C⋆p (S 0 )-module map

→ S(ρ̄⊕(d+1) ). Then it

f ∗ : H̃C⋆p (S(ρ̄⊕(d+1) )+ ; Z/p) → H̃C⋆p (ECp((p−1)(d+1)) + ; Z/p)
So, using module structure, we have
f ∗ (a (p−1)(d+1) ξ .1) = a (d+1)(p−1) ξ f ∗ (1).

2

Lemma 4.2 implies that a (p−1)(d+1) ξ .1 = 0. Therefore, this contradicts (4.4).

(p−1)(d+1)

Finally, note that ECp
is a free Cp -space of dimension (p − 1)(d + 1) and
∗(p−1)(d+1)+1
{1, · · · , p}
has connectivity (p−1)(d+1). Therefore, by Cp -equivariant obstruc(p−1)(d+1)
tion theory we have a Cp -map from ECp
→ {1, · · · , p}∗(p−1)(d+1)+1 . Thus a Cp -map

14

((p−1)(d+1))

from {1, · · · , p}∗(p−1)(d+1)+1 → S(ρ̄⊕d+1 ) induces a Cp -map ECp
→ S(ρ̄⊕(d+1) ),
contradicting Theorem 4.5. This contradiction implies the topological Tverberg conjecture
in the odd prime case. In fact, an analogous argument may be written also in the case
p = 2, but then the calculation is equivalent to Corollary 4.3.
4.2. Invariants of finite free Cp -spaces. Let X be a finite dimensional free Cp -space.
α (X ; Z/p) = 0 for dim α sufficiently large. Since the classes
Proposition 3.2 implies that H̃G
+
κξ and aξ raise the total degree (for an element of RO(G) we refer to the total degree as the
⋆
dimension) of H̃G
(X+ ; Z/p) by one or two respectively, so, there is minimum degree n(X)

of κǫξ ajξ , ǫ ∈ {0, 1} which acts trivially. That is,
(

min{2j + ǫ | κǫξ ajξ acts trivially on H̃G
n(X) =

min{j | aσ acts trivially on H̃G (X+ ; Z/2)},

for p odd
for p = 2.

The number n(X) behaves like an index of a G-space in the sense that if there is a G-map

X → Y , n(Y ) ≥ n(X). For otherwise, the map H̃G
(Y+ ; Z/p) → H̃G

be a map of H̃G
We now relate n(X) to the Fadell-Husenni index ([5]) for a G-space X. For a G-space
X and ring R, the Fadell-Husenni index of X is defined to be the kernel ideal of the map
p : EG ×G X → BG in cohomology induced by the G-equivariant projection X → pt :

IndexG (X; R) = Ker(p∗ : H ∗ (BG; R) → H ∗ (EG ×G X; R)).
If G = Cp and R = Z/p, note that the cohomology of BG is free of rank 1 in each degree. We
write i(X) to be the first integer i where the degree i part of IndexG (X; R) is non-trivial.
Theorem 4.6. n(X) = i(X).
Proof. For a free, finite dimensional G-space X we have up to G-homotopy a unique map
φ : X → EG. Also the Borel construction X ×G EG ≃ X/G. Now consider the commutative

Therefore, the result follows immediately from the Propostion 3.10, and the fact that the


4.3. Freeness theorem. We use the calculations from Section 3 to prove a freeness result
for certain G-cell complexes formed out of representations. One defines such a complex as
a Rep(G)-complex as below.
Definition 4.7. A Rep(G)-cell complex X is a G-space with a filtration {X (n) }n≥0 of
subspaces such that
a) X (0) is a finite union of disjoint copies of G/G.
b) For each n, X (n+1) is built up form X (n) by attaching cells of the form D(V ) along the

BREDON COHOMOLOGY OF FINITE DIMENSIONAL Cp -SPACES

15

boundary S(V ) with dim(V ) = n + 1.
c) X = ∪n≥0 X (n) has the colimit topology.
Not all finite G-spaces are representable as Rep(G)-complexes where cells are attached
sequentially in increasing dimension. Note that for G-spheres one may have equivariant
maps (not null-homotopic) which increase the total dimension. For example one has the
map
aξ : S V → S V ⊕ξ
which is non-trivial in cohomology if V is fixed point free (Proposition 3.2). In fact the
mapping cone of aξ : S 0 → S ξ is ΣS(ξ)+ , which is easily verified to have non-free cohomol1 (ΣS(ξ) ; Z/p) is not divisible by a or u but satisfies a · Σ1 = 0.
ogy. In fact Σ1 ∈ H̃G
+
ξ

⋆
One easily verifies analogously that the cohomologies H̃G
(S(kξ)+ ; Z/p) are all non-free.
There are plenty of examples of Rep(G)-complexes. The one point compactification S V
written as union of D(V ) identifying S(V ) to a point is one. Observe from [3, Section 8.1]
that CP (V ), Grk (V ) are also Rep(G)-complexes for a unitary G-representation V .
Our freeness result holds only for Rep(G)-complexes such that there are no cells in consecutive dimensions. In this context we make the following definition.

Definition 4.8. A Rep(G) complex is said to be sparse if it does not have cells in consecutive
dimensions.
An example of a sparse Rep(G)-complex is a complex with only even dimensional cells,
but one may observe easily that these are not all. The freeness result we prove here generalizes the analogous result for p = 2 in [15].
Remark 4.9. The sparseness condition is not present in the case p = 2, however, it is
necessary for a freeness theorem in the p odd case. This is due to the following example
of Clover May of a Rep(Cp )-complex with non-free cohomology. We have a Cp -map λ :
S ξ → S 2 = S ξ /Cp . Let Y be the mapping cone of λ, so that it is a representation complex.
The map λ induces an isomorphism on HC2 p , so that H̃Cnp (Y ) = 0 for all n. Now one may
observe that in H̃C⋆p (S 0 ), for every k there is a n such that H̃Ckξ−n
(S 0 ) 6= 0. It follows that
p
the cohomology of Y cannot have a summand of the type H̃C⋆−V
(S 0 ) and hence, cannot be
p
free.
We now build up the techniques leading to a proof of the freeness result. In view of the
i
j
equivalence HZ/p ∧ S ξ ≃ HZ/p ∧ S ξ for p ∤ i, j, we may assume that all the representations V in the cell complex decomposition contain only the trivial representations, and the
representation ξ.
We begin the proof with a localization theorem, which identifies the cohomology of finite
G-spaces after we invert the element aξ . This is the p odd version of [18, Lemma 4.3] with
a very similar proof. In the rest of the section p is an odd prime, and as a notation we write
⋆
⋆
H̃G
(Y ) for H̃G
(Y ; Z/p).

After a change of basis among ωi of dimension dim(V ) − 1, either one of the following holds
1) d(ω1 ) = 0.
2) ω1 = ν − 1, d(ω1 ) = ν and d(ωi ) = 0 for all i ≥ 2.
Proof. In order to prove the Lemma, we assume d(ω1 ) 6= 0 and then prove the conclusion
in 2). If dim(W1 ) = dim(V ) − 1, we must have W1 + 1 − V is of the form k(ξ − 2) for k > 0,
so that d(ω1 ) = ukξ ν up to units.
After rearranging ωi if necessary we assume that ω1 is the one with the least value of
−|(Wi + 1 − V )Cp | (this equals 2k where Wi + 1 − V = k(ξ − 2)) among {ωi | dim(ωi ) =
C
dim(ν) − 1, dim ω1 p < dim ν Cp , d(ωi ) 6= 0}. Since ω1 has the least value of k we have
t
d(uξ ω1 ) = d(ωi ) for some t, as ωi varies over the set above. We now change ωi to ωi − utξ ω1
to assume d(ωi ) = 0.
For the other ωj we have d(ωj ) = 0 or
d(ωj ) = Σ−1

In each case we may add a multiple of ω1 to ωj to ensure d(ωj ) = 0. Therefore, ω1 is the
only class with a non-trivial differential. We now are reduced to the simpler long exact

Therefore, the class q ∗ (ν) would survive to the aξ -localization and have uξ torsion, which
cannot happen in the cohomology of a finite space by Lemma 4.10.

We start at the crucial step in the proof for a cohomological two cell complex: This is
defined to be a G-space X for which there is a cofibre sequence
Σ−V HZ/p → F (X+ , HZ/p) → Σ−W HZ/p
with dim(W ) < dim(V ) − 1. This gives the long exact sequence

2. H̃G

Proof. If d(ω) = 0, the conclusion 1) holds. Otherwise from Proposition 3.6 we have that

Since the Bockstein of the class ω is zero, the Bockstein of right hand side of the boundary
must be zero. This forces that boundary should be one of the following form

In the latter case, dim(W ) = dim(V ) − 1. Therefore, it suffices to consider the case i). We

Finally we use Proposition 4.16 to prove the freeness result for sparse complexes.

Proof. We use induction on the cellular filtration {X (n) }n≥0 of X. The base case is the
0-skeleton which is a wedge of copies of S 0 . Since X is locally finite, it suffices to prove the

The boundary map d is a H̃G (S 0 ; Z/p)-module map. We first observe that after rearrangement there is a maximal n and elements ω1 , · · · , ωn satisfying the following properties

(ii) dim W1 < · · · < dim Wn < dim V

(iii) dim V Cp < dim W1 p < · · · < dim Wn p .
(iv) After a base change, dω = 0 for the free module generators other than {ω1 , · · · , ωn }.
If ω is not one of ω1 , · · · , ωn ; then there exists 1 ≤ j ≤ n such that dim W ≥ dim Wj and
dim W G ≤ dim WjG . In particular,

for some m, k ≥ 1 (by the Bockstein argument as in Lemma 4.14). Now we apply Proposition
⋆
4.16 to deduce that H̃G
(X+ ) is a free module on ωi′ and ν ′ . In order to complete the
induction we need to verify that β(ωi′ ) = 0. This is where the sparseness property comes in.
Observe from Proposition 4.16 that i∗ (β(ν ′ )) = 0 so that β(ν ′ ) = x.q ∗ ν. Since dim V ′ =
α (S 0 ) = 0 for dim α = 1 and dim αCp > 0, we
dim V , dim V ′Cp > dim V Cp , and that HG

obtain β(ν ) = 0. Analogously i (β(ωl )) = 0, which implies β(ωl′ ) = xq ∗ (ν). We note that
