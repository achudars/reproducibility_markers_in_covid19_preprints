Abstract. The Lyman-α forest 1D flux power spectrum is a powerful probe of several cosmological parameters. Assuming a ΛCDM cosmology including massive neutrinos, we find that
the latest SDSS DR14 BOSS and eBOSS Lyman-α forest data is in very good agreement with
current weak lensing constraints on (Ωm , σ8 ) and has the same small level of tension with
Planck. We did not identify a systematic effect in the data analysis that could explain this
small tension, but we show that it can be reduced in extended cosmological models where
the spectral index is not the same on the very different times and scales probed by CMB
and Lyman-α data. A particular case is that of a ΛCDM model including a running of the
spectral index on top of massive neutrinos. With combined Lyman-α and Planck data, we
find a slight (3σ) preference for negative running, αs = −0.010 ± 0.004 (68%CL). Neutrino
mass bounds are found
P to be robust against different assumptions. In the ΛCDM model with
running, we find
mν < 0.11 eV at the 95% confidence
level for combined Lyman-α and
P
Planck (temperature and polarisation) data, or
mν < 0.09 eV when adding CMB lensing
and BAO data. We further provide strong and nearly model-independent bounds on the
mass of thermal warm dark matter. For a conservative configuration consisting of SDSS data
restricted to z < 4.5 combined with XQ-100 Lyman-α data, we find mX > 5.3 keV (95%CL).

Introduction

Modern cosmological experiments have delivered an impressive amount of high-quality data
on several observables, related either to cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies,
to the Large Scale Structure of the Universe, or to its expansion history. In many cases,
the measurements are so precise that the interpretation of the data is limited by systematic
rather than statistical errors. Nevertheless, a consistent picture is emerging, with the minimal
6-parameter ΛCDM model standing out as the simplest explanation for most observations.
There are still very strong reasons for gathering more and better data. First, the current status of the ΛCDM model is not entirely clear, with intriguing and persistent hints
of anomalies like the small-scale dark matter crisis, the Hubble tension, and the σ8 tension.
To better understand what is going on, we need to combine several types of observations,
sensitive to different systematics. The comparison of different and independent probes is the
best way to get a clue on the origin of these tensions. Second, on the basis of laboratory
experiments and theoretical modelling, we believe that the total neutrino mass very likely
impacts cosmological observables at a level which is not very far from the current detection
threshold. Third, the possible detection of any signature beyond the simplest paradigm of

–1–

a cosmological constant, of some plain cold dark matter, of slow-roll inflation and Einstein’s
gravity would have a very deep impact on our quest for new physics.
The Lyman-α forest flux power spectrum is a powerful tool to study clustering in the
universe at redshifts 2 to 6, on scales that are strongly non-linear today, but were only mildly
non-linear at such high redshifts. Since it extends the lever arm of other cosmological probes
towards smaller scales, it has often been used to constraint the parameters of models affecting
only the smallest scales – like warm dark matter (WDM) [1–4] or interacting dark matter
[5–7] – or altering the global shape of the power spectrum – like non-slow-roll inflation or
massive neutrino free-streaming [8, 9]. Recent data from the Lyman-α flux power spectrum
provide some of the strongest existing bounds on the mass of WDM [10–14]. In combination
with CMB data, they also provide the strongest cosmological neutrino mass bounds to date
[15–19].
A new high precision measurement of the one-dimensional Lyman-α flux power spectrum
was recently published [20], using 43 751 high-quality quasar spectra from the Data Release 14
of the BOSS and eBOSS collaborations [21, 22]. It covers thirteen redshift bins from z = 2.2
to 4.6, up to the wavenumber k = 0.02 s km−1 . This work presents a first cosmological interpretation of this data set. For this purpose, we have assembled a grid of 138 hydrodynamical
simulations with a resolution equivalent to 3 × 30723 particles in a (100Mpc/h)3 box, which
we obtain using a splicing technique, extending the grid from [23] used in previous work.
We have built a likelihood for the new data set, and two analysis pipelines for cosmological
parameter extraction.
In section 2.1 we describe the data sets that we employ in this work. In section 2.2
we explain our settings and assumptions for numerical simulations and for the astrophysical
modeling of the intergalactic medium (IGM). In section 2.3 we have a short discussion on the
frequentist and Bayesian interpretation methodologies. Our results are presented in section
3. We start from the analysis of Lyman-α data alone in section 3.1, and we discuss its
compatibility with Planck and BAO data in section 3.2. In section 3.3 we combine the
Lyman-α, CMB, and BAO data for the ΛCDM model with massive neutrinos, and we show
that the compatibility between Lyman-α and Planck data could be improved in cosmological
models where the effective slope of the spectrum is different on CMB and Lyman-α scales.
In section 3.4 we present our bounds for an example of such a model, involving a running
of the spectral index. We present our neutrino (resp. WDM) mass bounds and discuss their
robustness in section 3.5 (resp. 3.6). Our conclusion are summarized in 4.

Data and Methodology

In this section, we first present the data sets we use. We then recall the modeling of the
Lyman-α forest developed in earlier works and introduce several new improvements. We
finally briefly describe the two interpretation methodologies used throughout this work, which
allow us to test the robustness of the obtained results.

2.1.1

Data
Lyman-α forest 1D flux power spectrum

We use the 1D Lyman-α flux power spectrum measurement from PY15 [17], which is based on
the DR14 BOSS and eBOSS data of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The data consist
of a subsample of 43 751 quasars selected from a parent sample of 180 413 quasars [24–27]
according to the spectrum quality. This sample improves over the one from SDSS BOSS
DR9 used in previous works both in statistical precision (achieving a reduction by a factor
of two) and in redshift coverage. We now have 13 equally-spaced redshift bins covering
the range from z = 2.2 to 4.6, as opposed to 12 bins from z = 2.2 to 4.4 in [28]. These
data also come with systematic uncertainties that result from an in-depth study of relevant
observational (resolution, noise, sky subtraction, continuum fitting) as well as astrophysical
effects (damped Lyman-α systems, broad absorption lines, metal contamination). We thus
perform the analysis on 435 Lyman-α data points, spread evenly over 35 bins in k space (from
k = 0.0011 s km−1 to 0.0195 s km−1 ) and 13 bins in redshift space. Figure 1 illustrates
P the
SDSS DR14 Lyman-α 1D flux power spectrum measurement and the best-fit ΛCDM + mν
model of section 3.1.
We also explore an extended Lyman-α data set by considering the 1D Lyman-α flux
power spectrum measurement from the one hundred XQ-100 quasars [19]. These data cover
three redshift bins at z = 3.2, 3.6, and 3.9. They exhibit a better resolution than the SDSS
data, and thus allow an extension of the analysis to slightly higher k modes, namely to
k = 0.05 s km−1 for z = 3.2, k = 0.06 s km−1 for z = 3.6, and k = 0.07 s km−1 for z = 3.9.
2.1.2

Cosmic microwave background

For the CMB data, we use the Planck 2018 data sets. The likelihoods for the Bayesian
approach are described in [29], and the corresponding publicly available chains are used for the
frequentist approach. We always use the full low-` and high-` temperature and polarization
data, denoted as “P18”. When specified, we also include the Planck 2018 CMB lensing data,
denoted as “lens.”.
2.1.3

Baryon acoustic oscillations

We also combine CMB data with measurements of the BAO scale by 6dFGS [30], SDSS
main galaxy sample [31], BOSS-LOWZ, and CMASS from DR12 [32]. Theses measurements
are henceforth globally denoted “BAO”. The additional constraints that these measurement
provide on cosmological parameters are included in the present work with their full correlation
with CMB data. For the frequentist approach described in section 2.3.1, both CMB and BAO
constraints are taken from the Markov chains publicly available through the official Planck
legacy archive. For the Bayesian approach, the constraints are directly derived from the
likelihoods available through MontePython 3.
2.2

Modeling of the Lyman-α forest 1D flux power spectrum

To predict the theoretical Lyman-α flux power spectrum, we use the set of simulations extensively described in BP14 [23] for the initial grid, in [33] for the active neutrino sector and in

ments generated with second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory 2lpt1 . We include three
particle types: collisionless dark matter, gas and, when relevant, mass-degenerate neutrinos.
We showed in [28] that considering inverted or normal neutrino mass hierarchy yields a flux
power spectrum that differs by less than 0.05% from the degenerate-mass scenario, a level ten
times below the simulation statistical uncertainties and almost two orders of magnitude below
the data uncertainties. The degenerate-mass hypothesis is thus highly justified. We use the
quick-Lyα option to convert gas particles with overdensities exceeding 103 and temperature
below 105 K into stars. The simulations cover the volume of a periodic 100 Mpc/h box,
containing the equivalent of 30723 particles of each type. Following a method originally suggested in [37], we obtain this resolution by splicing together large-volume and high-resolution
simulations, using a transition simulation that corrects the large-box simulation for its lack
of coupling between small and large modes, and the high-resolution simulation for its small
volume. We studied the accuracy of the splicing technique in [28] and [17], and we correct
for residual biases by the nuisance parameters Asplice and η splice . Snapshots are produced at
regular intervals in redshift from z = 4.6 to 2.2, with ∆z = 0.2, thus corresponding to the
same redshift bins as for the Lyman-α data.

The dependence of the Lyman-α flux power spectrum on the parameters ofPinterest
is modeled by a Taylor expansion within a set of cosmological {σ8 , ns , H0 , Ωm , mν or
1/mX , αs } and effective astrophysical {T0 (z = 3), γ(z = 3), Aτ , η τ } parameters. The grid
of simulations required for this interpolation consists of a reference simulation centered on
the Planck 2013 best-fit cosmology [38] and an IGM thermal history in agreement with [39, 40],
completed by simulations where one or two parameters at a time are given off-centered values. These simulations are used to compute a full second-order Taylor expansion around the
Lyman-α flux power spectrum measured for the reference case.
The cosmological parameters cover the range H0 = 67.5 ± 5 km s−1 Mpc−1 , ΩM =
0.31 ± 0.05, ns = 0.96 ± 0.05, σ8 = 0.83 ± 0.05. In all the runs,
P we keep Ωb = 0.0221. To
constrain neutrino masses, additional simulations are run with
mν = 0.4 or 0.8 eV. Where
WDM is assumed, the dark matter particles are thermal relics with masses mX = 2.5 or
5.0 keV. Since ΛCDM is reproduced for mX → ∞, we use 1/mX instead of mX in the Taylor
expansion, and the simulations therefore probe 1 keV/mX = 0, 0.2 and 0.4. When running
of the scalar index is assumed, we use a set of simulations where the running parameter
αs ≡ dns /d ln k is fixed to ±0.04. This allows us to introduce running directly in the Taylor
expansion and thus fully account for its impact on the 1D Lyman-α flux power spectrum,
whether direct or through cross-correlations with the other parameters. This feature was
not included in the previous analysis of PY15 [17], where running was included a posteriori
though a change of ns between large (CMB) and small (Lyman-α) scales according to the
relation ns (k) = ns (kp ) + αs × ln(k/kp ).
Astrophysical parameters are varied in the simulations by modifying the UV background.
The photoheating rates are varied to cover the range γ(z = 3) = 1.3 ± 0.3 and T0 (z = 3) =
14000 ± 7000 K in the outputs, where the IGM temperature is modeled for each redshift
according to the usual relation T = T0 × (ρ/hρi)γ−1 [41]. The photo-ionization rate of each
simulation was fixed by requiring the effective optical depth at each redshift to follow the
τ
empirical law τeff (z) = Aτ (1+z)η , with Aτ = 0.0025±0.0020 and η τ = 3.7±0.4 in agreement
with [39], and where τeff (z) is defined with respect to the mean flux as τeff (z) ≡ − lnhF (z)i.
This renormalization was done at the post-processing stage, as justified in [42], allowing us
to model the impact of different scalings without running new simulations.
The full modeling of the Lyman-α flux power spectrum includes further parameters
to allow for additional freedom in the IGM thermal history and to account for remaining
uncertainties or biases. We thus allow T0 (z) and γ(z) to vary as (1 + z)η , with a broken power
law at z = 3 for T0 and a single power law for γ, as done in several previous works and in
agreement with the recent works of [43, 44]. We also include two amplitudes for the correlated
absorptions by Lyman-α with Si II and Si III, which we use as multiplicative corrections to
the flux power spectrum. The study of WDM requires one to be able to lift the degeneracy
between Jeans smoothing and WDM free streaming. Therefore, for WDM studies, we account
for changes in the redshift of reionization by adding a nuisance term that reproduces the
impact of zreio on the redshift and mode dependence of the flux power spectrum, as was
done in [10]. The remaining parameters are nuisance parameters that allow us to account for
uncertainties or corrections related to noise in the data, spectrograph resolution, bias from the
splicing technique, UV fluctuations in the IGM, residual contamination from unmasked DLA,
and supernova and AGN feedbacks. Details on the fit parameters and on the dependence
with scale and redshift of the nuisance parameters can be found in PY15 [17]. In this work

–6–

we introduce an improved modeling of the AGN feedbacks derived from the detailed study of
[45]. The authors measure a significant and well understood impact of AGN feedback on the
Lyman-α forest properties, which suppresses the Lyman-α 1D flux power spectrum by up to
6% on large scales, and of order 1% on the smallest scales probed by the eBOSS data. The
SN feedback acts on similar scales, and partially compensates the effect of AGNs. We adopt
the new more accurate model from [45] to correct the predicted power spectrum for the AGN
feedback and we use the same study as before from [46] to correct for the SN feedback. For
both feedbacks, we apply a Gaussian prior around the central value of the correction (see
table 2). The definition of all parameters that describe the Lyman-α flux power spectrum
can be found in table 1.
2.3

Interpretation methodology

To assess the robustness of the results, we use two different interpretation methodologies;
frequentist and Bayesian. We briefly explain below how we combine the Lyman-α and CMB
studies in both cases.
2.3.1

Frequentist interpretation

Our determination of the coverage intervals of unknown cosmological parameters is based on
the “classical” confidence level method originally defined by [47]. We start with the likelihood
L x, σx ; Θ), for a given cosmological model defined by the n cosmological, astrophysical and
nuisance parameters Θ = (θ1 , . . . , θn ), and for data measurements x with Gaussian experimental errors σx . In the rest of this paper, we adopt a χ2 notation, which means that the
following quantity is minimized:
χ2 (x, σx ; Θ) = −2 ln(L(x, σx ; Θ)) .

(2.1)

We first determine the minimum χ2min of χ2 (x, σx ; Θ) leaving all the cosmological parameters
free. Then, to set a confidence level (CL) on any individual cosmological parameter θi , we
scan the variable θi : for each fixed value of θi , we minimize again χ2 (x, σx ; Θ) but with n − 1
free parameters. The χ2 difference, ∆χ2 (θi ), between the new minimum and χ2min , allows us
to compute the CL on the variable, assuming that the experimental errors are Gaussian,
Z ∞
CL(θi ) = 1 −

with the χ2 distribution
e−t/2 tNdof /2−1
fχ2 (t; Ndof ) = √
,
2Ndof Γ(Ndof /2)

(2.3)

where Γ is the Gamma function and the number of degrees of freedom Ndof is equal to 1.
This profiling method can be easily extended to two variables. In this case, the minimizations
are performed for n − 2 free parameters and the confidence level CL(θi , θj ) is derived from
Equation (2.2) with Ndof = 2.
In this paper we also combine the χ2 derived from the Lyα likelihood with that of
Planck. In the frequentist analysis, we do not use the Planck likelihoods directly, but we

use the Markov chains available in the official Planck2 repositories instead. For instance, for
the Planck 2018 TT+TE+EE configuration with massive neutrino, we take the chains from
the directory base_mnu/plikHM_TTTEEE_lowl_lowE,
which we reduce to the cosmological
P
parameters {σ8 , ns , Ωm , H0 , mν } that are relevant for our analysis. The distribution of the
chain elements allow us to estimate the posterior probability distributions for each
P parameter
and the correlations between parameters. The flat positive prior applied
to
mν causes a
P
distortion of all posterior probability distributions,
in
particular
for
m
,
and
thus
also for
ν
P
{σ8 , Ωm }, which are strongly correlated with
mν . The posterior probability distribution
becomes asymmetric and cannot be modeled by a simple Gaussian distribution. To account
for such effects, we first apply a Principal Component Analysis on the reduced chain that
allows us to determine the linearly uncorrelated variables, called the principal components.
We then model the distribution of each principal component by several asymmetric Gaussians.
P
We validated this strategy for a few configurations by comparing the limits obtained on mν
with this modeling with the limits derived directly from the MCMC approach using the full
likelihood. The agreement between the two approaches was typically at the level of a few
percent.
2.3.2

Bayesian interpretation

The Bayesian determination of the credible intervals of the parameters is based on their
full posterior distribution according to Bayes theorem. The posterior distribution represents the probability distribution of the estimation of the true parameter value, which was
improved upon by the experiment compared to the prior estimation. To obtain the posterior distribution, we use the implementation of the Metropolis Hastings algorithm from

MontePython 3 [48] for our Monte-Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC). For each case, we run
chains of an average total length of around 7 million steps, out of which on average around
1.5 million steps are accepted. We have explicitly checked that the convergence criteria of
Gelman-Rubin for any parameter of any run are at most |R − 1| < 0.01.
For our cosmological P
parameter basis we choose {ωb , ωcdm , 100θs , ln 1010 As , ns , τreio },
plus a total neutrino mass
mν split beteween three degenerate species. Since this corresponds to the parameter basis in the Planck analysis, one can directly see the improvement
coming from the addition of Lyman-α data. Many of the common degeneracies in CMB data
analyses are removed by choosing appropriate flat priors (e.g. on θs instead of H0 ). However,
we checked explicitly (e.g. with runs assuming a flat prior on H0 rather than θs , σ8 rather
than ln 1010 As , and Ωm rather than ωcdm ) that the choice of the parameter basis does not
significantly influence the results.
The prior range for each astrophysical or nuisance parameter is shown in table 2. Cosmological parameters are all allowed to vary freely without bounds (which amounts to assuming
a flat prior in a wide range compared to the width of the posterior), except for two cases. We
impose τreio > 0.004, since smaller values imply a reionization happening below redshift z = 1,
which causes numerical problems and
P is now excluded by almost all data sets. Additionally,
we
impose
the
physical
limitation
p mν > 0. Note that oscillation experiments constrain
P
mν to be larger P
than at least |∆m232 | ∼ 0.05eV (see e.g. [49], section 14). Assuming
a lower prior edge
mν > 0 still makes sense: it amounts to studying limits on neutrino
masses with minimal assumptions on neutrino decoupling and neutrino stability on cosmological time scales (which is not granted, e.g. [50, 51]). One could adopt a different point of
view and derive cosmological bounds under the assumption that neutrinos
decouple in the
P
standard way and are fully stable, such that the oscillationPprior
mν > 0.05eV applies.
This would lead to slightly weaker cosmological bounds on
mν [52]. Both approaches are
consistent but simply address different questions. In this work, we only explore the first prior
choice.
The 95% CL for the sum of the neutrino masses is always derived as containing 95%
of the full posterior integral, starting from the lower bound of the posterior. The quoted 1σ
uncertainties on the other parameters are those that contain ∼ 68.3% of the posterior centered
around the mean value. Usually the 1D posteriors are close enough to being Gaussian that
we do not display information other than the mean and sigma values.

Results

We present below the results obtained with both methodologies. We first focus on the constraints from Lyman-α data alone, and assess their compatibility with CMB constraints. In
particular, we discuss a mild tension in the Ωm parameter between the CMB and Lyman-α
data. We then combine the data sets, assuming either a minimal cosmology (ΛCDM with
massive neutrinos) or some basic extensions that may reduce this mild tension, with a particular focus on models with a running of the primordial spectral index. We discuss active
neutrino mass bounds and their robustness against different assumptions. Finally, we present
the constraints obtained for warm dark matter in the form of a thermal relic of mass mX or
in the form of a non-resonantly-produced sterile neutrino of mass ms , which are robust with
respect to the aforementioned tension.

3.1

Cosmological constraints from Lyman-α data alone

As was noted in PY15 [17], the Lyman-α forest flux power spectrum only weakly depends on
the Hubble parameter, and is unable to constrain H0 by itself. When using Lyman-α data
alone, we thus adopt the same Gaussian prior constraint as in [10, 11, 20, 28], which is taken
from the Planck 2015 TT+lowP results [53], namely H0 = 67.3 ± 1.0 km s−1 Mpc−1 . Note
that most recent result from [54] using TT, TE, EE, low E + lensing gives H0 = 67.36 ± 0.54,
in perfect agreement with the prior mentioned above. In [28], we explicitly checked that
bounds on other parameters depend very weakly on the choice of H0 prior. In particular, the
Lyman-α posteriors are not significantly different when we combined the Lyman-α data with
an H0 prior taken from the SH0 ES results [55].
The IGM thermal history is one of the main sources of nuisance in this study. To
encompass a large range of possible histories,
we marginalize over the thermal parameters of
P
table 1 to derive constrains either on
mν (sections 3.1 to 3.5) or on the mass of a WDM
thermal relic (section 3.6). We show in appendix A the recovered best-fit thermal history in
each case. Because of the freedom allowed in the modeling, the uncertainties on the thermal
parameters are large, and the 2σ range on T0 , γ and mean flux overlaps with observational
measurements. To further test the robustness of our result, we also investigate how the
constraints we derive depend on our hypotheses and we investigate the impact of a different
thermal model. As shown in appendix A, imposing a thermal model in agreement with a
specific set of measurements [40] has little impact on the measured bounds.
As a sanity check on the interpretation methodologies, we assess the compatibility between the Bayesian and frequentist best-fit values of the cosmological parameters for Lyman-α
data alone, in the standard ΛCDM cosmological model with massless or massive neutrinos.
As shown in table 3, the results for the two methodologies are in excellent agreement, both
for the central value of the parameters and for their uncertainty. The flux power spectrum of
the best-fit model is shown in figure 1. Compared to the previous work of PY15 [17], there
is a noticeable improvement in the agreement between the data and the best-fit model, in
particular for high k and high z.
The best fit on Lyman-α data alone slightly differs from the one obtained on the DR9
data for two cosmological parameters: ns , which increased from 0.938 ± 0.010 in PY15 [17] to

– 10 –

0.954 ± 0.006, and Ωm , which decreased from 0.293 ± 0.014 to 0.269 ± 0.009. We investigated
the origin of this ∼ 1.5 σ shift. Restricting the eBOSS data to the forests in common with
those from DR9, we measure ns = 0.945 ± 0.008 and Ωm = 0.278 ± 0.015. To further mimic
the DR9 selection, we then replace the automated catalogs of Broad Absorption Line quasars
and Damped Lyman-α systems by the visual catalogs that were used in DR9. The fit on the
resulting sample gives ns = 0.935±0.008 and Ωm = 0.282±0.015, in good agreement with the
cosmology obtained with the analysis of PY15 [17] on the DR9 sample. This result concurs
with what was found in a similar study led in [20]. The change in the data is therefore at the
origin of the small shift in best-fit cosmological parameters.

3.2

Mild tension between Planck and Lyman-α data

Before combining the Lyman-α data with CMB data, we compare the results from the
Lyman-α DR14 flux power spectrum (see table 3) and from Planck 2018 (see table 4) with
minimal assumptionsP
on the cosmological model, i.e. in the framework of the ΛCDMν model
with a free value of
mν . The common free parameters in the Lyman-α and Planck likelihoods are the primordial spectrum amplitude and spectral index
P {σ8 or As , ns , }, the fractional density of matter Ωm , and possibly the neutrino mass
mν . There are two more
common parameters Ωb and H0 , but the Lyman-α data are so weakly sensitive to them that
we fixed Ωb and imposed an H0 prior that guarantees agreement with Planck.
For all common parameters but one, we find excellent agreement between the confidence
bounds derived from Lyman-α data and CMB data. This can be checked
P directly from tables
3 and 4, or visually by comparing two-dimensional contours in the { mν , σ8 , ns } plane in
figures 2 and 3. In the Bayesian case, one should look at figure 2 and compare red contours
(Lyman-α) with blue contours (P18+lens+BAO). In the frequentist case, figure 3 shows again
the Lyman-α contours in red and the P18 contours in blue. For instance, for ns , the Lyman-α
and P18+lens+BAO bounds are compatible at the 1.4σ level.
We find a mild tension between the Ωm values derived from CMB data (Ωm ∼ 0.31)
and Lyman-α data (Ωm ∼ 0.27). The tension is present with both methodologies, with or
without massive neutrinos, and with respect to both the P18 and P18+lens+BAO datasets.
For instance, in the ΛCDMν model, the Bayesian (resp. frequentist) analysis returns a 2.5σ
(resp. 3.6σ) tension between the Ωm values derived from the BOSS DR14 flux spectrum and
the P18+Lens+BAO combination. This tension is displayed in the {Ωm , ns } plane in the left
panel of figure 4.
Figure 4 (left panel) shows that for a fixed value of Ωm around 0.31, this mismatch
could instead be interpreted as a mild tension on ns . This is reminiscent of a similar tension
on ns found with previous Lyman-α data from BOSS DR9 discussed in [17]. When fitting
the parameters of the ΛCDM model or its extensions to Lyman-α data, ns and Ωm are
always anti-correlated, because they both affect the overall slope of the flux power spectrum
in the same direction. Therefore the tension on Ωm in the present version of the data set
and likelihood is likely to have the same origin as the tension on ns in the previous version:
whether the tension is interpreted as one on ns or as one on Ωm strongly depends on the
modeling of the data and its systematics. In any case, since the analysis presented in this
work is based on the most up-to date data set and on the most advanced systematic modeling

We stress that the Lyman-α results are nicely consistent with those from weak lensing
(WL) surveys. Over the past years, there has been a mild but persistent tension between
likelihood contours in the (Ωm , σ8 ) plane inferred from Planck data and from WL surveys,
when assuming either a ΛCDM or ΛCDMν cosmology. This is commonly referred to as the
“σ8 tension”, although Ωm is also involved. The tension is actually best seen when quoting results on the combination S8 ≡ σ8 (Ωm /0.3)0.5 which is orthogonal to a direction of degeneracy
in the WL posteriors.
In Figure 5, we show the contours of the new BOSS + eBOSS DR14 Lyman-α data
(combined again with a H0 prior) in the (Ωm , σ8 ) and (Ωm , S8 ) planes, compared with those
from one of the most recent joint analyses [56] of several WL data sets (DES-Y1 [60, 61],
KV450 [62]), and finally compared with Planck contours, assuming in each case a ΛCDM
cosmology. The left panel of Figure 5 shows that the σ8 tension can be equally well interpreted
as an Ωm tension. While the CMB versus WL tension is strongest in the S8 direction, the
CMB versus Lyman-α tension is strongest in the Ωm direction. It is striking to see that WL
and Lyman-α data, which are two late time probes of a similar range of scales, agree with

Instead of using the DES-Y1 redshift distributions [57], these new analyses use photometric redshifts from
COSMOS-2015 [56, 58, 59]. Note also that we are considering a flat ΛCDM model in agreement with the
cited analyses.

Table 5. Tests performed to investigate possible sources of improvement of the consistency between
Lyman-α and Planck likelihoods. Improvement is quantified by ∆χ2 : the χ2 difference between
separate and combined data sets.

We performed a systematic search of the origin of this tension, investigating possible
sources of systematics both at the level of the modeling of the Lyman-α 1D flux power
spectrum and at the level of the Lyman-α data analysis. In table 5, we summarize in each
case the improvement in the consistency of the Lyman-α and the CMB likelihoods, which
we quantify by the change in the χ2 difference between separate and combined data sets. A
negative ∆χ2 indicates an improved agreement, whereas a positive ∆χ2 shows an enhanced
tension. We first considered sub-samples of the Lyman-α data to identify possible regions
in k or in z-space that would pull the fit away from the model preferred by CMB data.
The results are reported in the left column of table 5. We tested the impact of the smallest
scales (cutting out k > 0.017 s km−1 ) as these are the most affected by our knowledge of the
spectrograph resolution and our understanding of the noise power contribution (first row).
We tested removing the large-scale modes (restricting to k > 0.0025 s km−1 ) instead, since
these have the smallest statistical uncertainties and hence a large constraining power on the
slope of the power spectrum (second row). We selected different redshift ranges, keeping
only the lowest redshift bins (rows 3 and 4) that have better statistics, or instead the higher
redshift ones (rows 5 and 6) that are less prone to systematics related to the measurement of
the noise power. None of these tests yielded any significant change in the Lyman-α best-fit
cosmological values.
In a second stage, we modified in several ways the model we use to fit the Lyman-α
data (right column of table 5). The first test was using the correction suggested by [63] to
account for the incompleteness of the masking of the damped Lyman-α systems (DLA) in
the data, instead of the one from [64] that was used in [20]. This had no impact, as shown in
the first row. As detailed in PY15 [17], the splicing technique produces a k-dependent bias
caused by the change of splicing regime at a pre-determined pivot scale. The bias can be
modeled by a broken line with a possible, albeit small, trend for some redshift evolution. We
applied two new correction models to test whether the model we had opted for was responsible
for the different slopes preferred by the Lyman-α and the CMB data. The model adopted
in PY15 [17] includes a low-k slope and a redshift evolution that are taken from the splicing
study, and two free parameters: the high-k slope and the offset at the pivot scale. Alternative
splicing 1 is a model with no redshift dependence, a high-k slope fixed to 0 and two free
parameters: the low-k slope and the offset. Alternative splicing 2 has no redshift dependence,
but allows for variation in both low-k and high-k slopes as well as a free offset. Neither
splicing model yields a notable change on ∆χ2 . Finally, we also tested fitting the Lyman-α

– 15 –

data with a loose flat prior on H0 between 55 and 80 km s−1 Mpc−1 , instead of the usual
Gaussian prior of H0 = 67.3 ± 1.0 km s−1 Mpc−1 . This had negligible impact on the result, as
expected from the earlier studies of [28]. The last two lines of table 5, assuming two distinct
values of ns on large and small scales or a running of ns , refer to the study we describe in
detail in the next two sections, and which leads to a notable improvement on the agreement
between Lyman-α and CMB data.
We cannot exclude the possibility that the tension between the value of Ωm preferred by
CMB and Lyman-α data originates from yet another unidentified systematics (or imperfection
in the computation of the Lyman-α likelihood). Indeed, with statistical uncertainties on the
data points down at the percent level, results on cosmological parameters are now hitting
the systematics floor. Despite the great care that went into their modeling, instrumental
features – such as correction of spectrograph resolution and subtraction of noise power –
affect the lowest redshift bins and the smallest scales at a level comparable to the statistical
uncertainties. Uncertainties also arise on the simulation side, mostly in relation to the use
of the splicing technique mentioned above. Although the bias induced by this approach
was measured to be small, and although we mitigate the risk of an imperfect modeling by
marginalizing over the parameters that correct for the impact of splicing, a residual bias on
the large-scale correction would affect the slope of the 1D flux power spectrum and could be
responsible for the observed tension.
3.3

Combining CMB and Lyman-α data

CMB and Lyman-α data can be combined with different assumptions on the underlying
cosmology.
First, one can adopt the point of view that the tension on Ωm described in section 3.2
is sufficiently small that it should not prevent us from combining the data sets while sticking
to the ΛCDMν model. In this case, the combined limits on cosmological parameters – using
either the frequentist or Bayesian methodology – are presented in table 6. We will come back
to the discussion of the neutrino mass bounds found in this analysis in a dedicated section 3.5.
Since the Planck data has more statistical weight, the Ωm values in the combined fit are driven
to Planck best-fit values, as shown in figure 4. The other cosmological parameters, already
in good agreement between their best-fit values for the two data sets taken individually,
do not change significantly. While Planck data carry no information per se on the IGM
thermal history, they can affect the best-fit values of the astrophysical parameters through
their correlations with the cosmological terms. For instance, the anti-correlation between Ωm
and γ – and to a lesser extent between ns and γ – is causing γ to decrease compared to its
value for the fit with Lyman-α data alone, since both Ωm and ns are increased. All correlation
coefficients, and comments thereof, are provided in appendix B.

Since for a fixed value of Ωm around 0.31, the tension could be interpreted as a tension
in ns , it is interesting to check whether the two data sets can be brought in better agreement
by allowing the overall slope of the CMB and Lyman-α flux power spectra to be independent
of each other. To check this, we first perform an academic study in which we assume different
values of ns in the CMB and in the Lyman-α likelihoods. Our results for that case are
presented in table 7.
In this configuration, the global χ2 decreases by ∼ 13.8 for P18+lens+BAO+Lyman-α
compared to the ΛCDMν fit, which represents an improved compatibility between Lyman-α
and P18+lens+BAO and data. The corresponding two-dimensional {Ωm , ns } contours, displayed in the right panel of figure 4, now feature two distinct regions; one (dashed lines)
for ns (Lyman-α) and another (solid lines) for ns (Planck). The two values of ns are centered
around ns = 0.967 for Planck and ns = 0.941 for Lyman-α data. In the right panel of figure 4,
the improved compatibility shows up in the fact that the red contour (Lyman-α only) is now
in better agreement with the green and yellow dashed contours (combined data set).
Of course, the improved agreement occurs at the price of rather unphysical assumptions.
This exercise is however not completely artificial, because the CMB and Lyman-α data sets
probe different fluctuations (photon perturbations or a tracer of baryons and CDM fluctuations) on different scales and at different times. Thus there could be many physical and
sensible reasons for which the overall slope of the two observables are not correlated in the
way predicted by the ΛCDM or ΛCDMν models.
First, the primordial power spectrum could have a different effective slope ddlnlnPkR due
to physical mechanisms taking place during inflation. For instance, a large curvature in the
inflaton potential could produce a running of the spectral index, i.e. a continuous variation
of ddlnlnPkR with k [65], while a kink in the potential could lead to a feature in the primordial
spectrum with different spectral indices on large and small scale [66].
Second, the growth rate of dark matter could be reduced on small scales during radiation
and/or matter domination, for instance due to small interactions between dark matter and
other species or self-interactions in the dark matter sector, or by a small departure from
Einstein gravity. Since baryons fall in the gravitational potential wells of dark matter, this
reduction would propagate to the baryons and to the flux power spectrum. An example of a
mechanism leading to a small reduction of the effective slope of the matter power spectrum
d ln Pm
d ln k is provided by the scattering dark matter model of [67]. Another case is that of
f (R) gravity, that leads to a scale-dependent linear growth factor with less growth on small
scales [68].
In principle, a dedicated analysis would be needed in order to investigate up to which
extent each of these models can reduce the mild tension between Lyman-α and CMB data.
In this work, we limit ourselves to the most studied among the previous models, featuring a

On the theoretical side, the running of the spectral index is usually connected to the physics of
inflation, but we should keep in mind that it could be seen as an effective parametrization of

the amplitude and of the effective slope of the small-scale matter power spectrum that could
mimick a scale-dependent reduction of the linear growth factor. The simplest inflationary
models predict that the running of the spectral index should be of second order in inflationary
slow-roll parameters and therefore small, |αs | ∼ (ns − 1)2 ∼ 10−3 [65]. Nevertheless, it is
possible to accommodate a larger scale dependence of ns by adjusting the third derivative in
the inflaton potential (see for instance [69, 70]).
On the experimental side, recent CMB experiments have a mixed history of null results
and a-few-sigma detections of running of the scalar index. The final 9-year WMAP analysis
found no evidence of running using WMAP alone, with αs = −0.019 ± 0.025 at 68% CL,
while the combination of WMAP data with the first data releases from ACT and SPT found
a negative running at nearly the 2σ level with αs = −0.022 ± 0.012 [71]. The ACT 3-year
release measured αs = −0.003 ± 0.013 when combining with WMAP-7 [72]. A negative
running was detected at just over 2σ by SPT, αs = −0.024 ± 0.011 [73]. The Planck 2018
results, while roughly consistent with zero running of the scalar spectral index, indicate a ∼ 1σ
preference for negative running, αs = −0.0041 ± 0.0067. Finally, in the paper PY15 [17], we
reported a ∼ 3σ tension on ns when we combined Planck 2015 and the DR9 BOSS Lyman-α
measurement, which yielded αs = −0.0117 ± 0.0033.
The analysis of PY15 [17], however, was simplified: the effect of running on the Lyman-α
likelihood was approximated as a change in the spectral index following the relation ns (k) =
ns (kp )+αs ×ln(k/kp ). In the present work, we performed dedicated simulations accounting for
the full effect of running on the primordial spectrum, and added αs to the list of parameters
in the Taylor expansion of the flux power spectrum and in the Lyman-α likelihood. The
result of our combined fit of CMB and Lyman-α data for the ΛCDMν + αs cosmology are
presented in table 8. The value of the spectral index reported here is defined at the pivot
scale k∗ = 0.05 Mpc−1 .
As in section 3.1, the Bayesian and frequentist approaches provide consistent results.
Allowing a running of ns improves the global fit to P18+lens+BAO+Lyman-α by ∆χ2 ∼ 8.2
compared to the plain ΛCDMν model. This is a bit less than when floating two independent
tilts, which yielded ∆χ2 ∼ 13.8. There are two reasons for this. First, the Lyman-α data
alone shows no preference for negative running, i.e. for a negative curvature in the shape of
the flux power spectrum. Thus, although the χ2 of the combined fit decreases, the Lyman-α
contribution to the total χ2 increases slightly. Second, in the model with running, negative
values of αs also suppress the fluctuation amplitude on the smallest and largest scales probed
by Planck (i.e., in the regions of the Sachs-Wolfe plateau and Silk damping tail). This disfavors
too low values of the running, as shown by the Planck-only bound αs = −0.0041 ± 0.0067.
The fit with two independent ns values does not have this effect on CMB data and allows
for a slightly stronger variation of the spectrum slope between CMB and Lyman-α scales,
explaining the stronger decrease in the best-fit χ2 .
In a model with non-zero running, the Lyman-α data are compatible with significantly
larger values of Ωm than in the ΛCDMν model. With a large negative running, the effective
slope of the spectrum on Lyman-α scales can be small (corresponding to a small effective
ns (Lyman-α)), and thus Ωm can be large. We obtain a detection of running at the ∼ 3σ
level. With both Pl8+Lyman-α and Pl8+Lyman-α +lensing+BAO data sets, we find αs =
−0.010 ± 0.004, in agreement with the previous measurement of PY15.

Neutrino mass bounds

The combination P
of Lyman-α and CMB data presents several advantages. CMB data alone is
more sensitive to mν than Lyman-α data alone, through CMB lensing, the integrated Sachs
Wolfe effect, and the measurement of the angular diameter distance to recombination [74–
76]. Combining the
P data sets helps in breaking degeneracies between cosmological parameters,
such as between
P mν and σ8 (or As ), ns and Ωm . This contributes to further tightening the
constraint on
mν .
P
The constraint on
mν coming from Lyman-α alone (with the H0 prior) are included
in table 3, and those from P18 or P18+lens+BAO in table 4. The joint bounds are presented
in table 6 for the ΛCDMν model, table 7 for the case with two independent spectral indices,
and table 8 for the ΛCDMν + αs case.
P
The joint Lyman-α +P18+lens+BAO on
mν are loosened by a moderate amount
(16%) when switching from the ΛCDMν fit (frequentist bound of 0.89 meV at 95%CL) to the
fit with two free spectral indices (frequentist
bound of 0.104 meV). To understand this, we can
P
look at 2D contours in the (Ωm , mν ) space for these two models, shown in figure 6. The
combined bounds P
are strongly influenced by the fact that Lyman-α data remove a degeneracy
between Ωm and
mν in the CMB+BAO data. Thus the neutrino mass bounds must be
discussed together with the mild ∼ 2σ tension between the values of Ωm preferred by the
two data sets. Since the tension is the strongest in the ΛCDMν model, the neutrino mass is
the most constrained in this case. In the model with two spectral indices, the Lyman-α data
accommodate slightly larger values of Ωm , because they are partly compensated by lower

– 20 –

values of ns at the level of the flux power spectrum. Thus the tension is relaxed and the
neutrino mass bound gets a bit looser. The same trend is true in the ΛCDMν + αs case, but
the neutrino mass bounds remain slightly tighter than in the case with the two ns values.
It is remarkable that all the neutrino mass bounds presented here fall within 20% of
each other, despite the P
very different assumptions on the scale dependence of the spectral
index. Our results for
mν are thus found to be robust against various assumptions on
the possible origin of the mild tension between Lyman-α and Planck data when assuming a
ΛCDMν cosmology. As a final result for neutrino masses, we choose to highlight the bounds
coming from the most conservative ofPour two analyses based on a physical model, namely,
the ΛCDMν +αs analysis. We obtain mν < 0.11eV (resp. < 0.09eV) at the 95% confidence
level for Lyman-α +P18 (resp. Lyman-α +P18+lens. +BAO) data, both from the frequentist
or the Bayesian approach.
Given the results on neutrino oscillations (e.g. [77] for a review), these results put
marginal tension on the
Pinverted neutrino mass hierarchy scenario, which predicts a lower
bound
of
99.5
meV
for
mν . Note however that an analysis adopting the P
“oscillation prior”
P
mν > 0.05 meV would return a looser bound than our analysis assuming
mν > 0. Thus,
inverted hierarchy cannot be considered as disfavored at the 2σ level by our data set.
We also explored the impact of higher-resolution Lyman-α data by including the XQ-100
flux power spectrum measured by [19]. The fit to the extended Lyman-α data set improves
our sensitivity to neutrino masses, with tighter 3σ bounds and steeper likelihood profiles than
in the case of DR14 Lyman-α
P data alone. However, XQ-100 has a very marginal preference for
a non-zero neutrino mass,
mν = 0.13 ± 0.18 eV. Thus the combined bounds from Lyman-α
XQ-100 + DR14 data (including the P
H0 prior) are not stronger than from DR14 data alone
as one may have expected: we find
mν < 0.53 eV for the joint bound. This trend was
already noticed in [19], and shown for instance in their figure 10. The same is true when
CMB data is added onP
top. The limit obtained from DR14 + XQ-100 + P18 data assuming
a ΛCDMν cosmology,
mν < 0.122 eV, is slightly degraded compared to the one shown in
table 6, again in agreement with the study of [19].

Constraints on ΛWDM model

As explained in section 2.2, the simulation grid can also be used to derive constraints on
warm dark matter (WDM) in the form of thermal relics, since we performed simulations with
non zero values of 1 keV/mX . Here, we use the set of WDM simulations presented in [10]
to provide results on thermal relics and non-resonantly-produced (hereafter “NRP”) sterile
neutrinos. We refer to [10] for extensive justification of this approach and we only summarize
the main result here.
As described by Dodelson and Widrow [78], a sterile neutrino population can be produced
by non-resonant oscillations with the active sector in the early Universe (around T ∼ 100MeV
for keV masses). This leads to a quasi-thermal distribution function for the sterile neutrinos,
even if they never reached thermal equilibrium. Thanks to a symmetry in the evolution
equations of linear perturbations, thermal WDM relics with a mass mX produce the same
cut-off in the linear power spectrum as NRP sterile neutrinos with a mass ms inferred from

Since for this category of models, WDM simulations depend on the nature of WDM only
through the input linear power spectrum [79], simulations with thermal relics can also be
used to derive bounds on NRP sterile neutrinos. Other classes, such as resonantly-produced
sterile neutrinos, are of particular relevance. One cannot, however, constrain their mass
through a simple rescaling of mX . It requires a dedicated study that is beyond the scope of
this work.
To constrain the mass of a WDM thermal relic, we use a Lyman-α data set consisting of
the eBOSS DR14 data combined with the XQ-100 data from [19]. The use of high-resolution
data to constrain WDM has recently been subject to debate [80, 81]. On the one hand, they
are expected to be more sensitive to WDM as they better probe the scale range impacted
by the WDM power suppression, as illustrated in Figure 7. On the other hand, this cut-off
is partially degenerate with a similar effect caused instead by a warm IGM. We here use the
same model of the IGM thermal history as in the previous sections, allowing, in addition,
variations of zreio as explained in section 2.2.
The eBOSS DR14 + XQ-100 Lyman-α data constrain the WDM mass to mX > 8.6 keV
(95% CL). Because non-linear structure growth tends to erase the power suppression caused
by the free-streaming of relativistic particles, the sensitivity to mX is more prominent at

high redshift. Thus, the high-redshift data are the ones with the largest constraining power,
despite having the largest statistical uncertainties. This feature is confirmed by the loosening
of the bound as we restrict the data to lower redshifts. We obtain mX > 5.3 keV for z < 4.5,
and mX > 3.9 keV for z < 4.1, both at 95% CL. This trend is also clearly visible in figure 8,
where we show the χ2 profiles for the three configurations. The profile widens (hence the
constraint loosens) as we go from all redshifts (dark blue) to z < 4.5 (blue) then to z < 4.1
(light-blue).
The gain provided by the highest-redshift z = 4.6 bin, however, is two-fold. It is due in
part because the z = 4.6 power spectrum probes structure growth in a more linear regime,
but also because the minimum of the fit then occurs for 1 keV/mX < 0. The FeldmanCousins prescription [82] allows us to derive the limit in such a case, by computing the ∆χ2
with respect to the χ2 at the limit of the physical domain, i.e. where 1 keV/mX = 0. This
method, however, leads to an artificially strong limit, since the χ2 profile in the physical
(mX > 0) region is a very steep function of 1 keV/mX . To be conservative, we hence consider
as our main result the bound obtained in the eBOSS DR14 (z < 4.5) + XQ-100 configuration:
mX > 5.3 keV (95% CL). We highlight the fact that removing the highest z = 4.6 redshift
bin is sufficient to ensure that the best-fit minimum be in the physical region. Further data
restriction does not alter its location. In table 9, we give the best-fit values of some of the main
parameters with the two methodologies. We note an excellent agreement on all parameters.
These new bounds are significantly tighter than the 4.2 keV lower limit derived with
BOSS DR9 (z < 4.5) + XQ-100 by [19] (red curve in figure 8). The improvement mostly
comes from the improved statistical power of the eBOSS DR14 data compared to BOSS
DR9, as is made clear by the comparison of the the limits obtained with the same z < 4.5
redshift range.
Because the IGM thermal history produces a cut-off in the flux power spectrum that is
partially degenerate with the impact of a relativistic particle, we paid particular attention to
the thermal modeling. The recovered T0 (z), γ(z) and mean flux are shown in appendix A.
All three parameters are in perfect agreement with typical observed ranges. We also checked
the impact of a different modeling by imposing a central thermal history in agreement with
the observations of [40] and allowing variations in the amplitude and density dependence of
the UV heating rates (AMPL and GRAD parameters of the hydrodynamical code Gadget).

profiling method, i.e. after minimization over all other free parameters. The curves are the result of
a parabolic fit to the points, extrapolated into the negative region.

This only had a mild impact on the constraints, which led to mX > 4.7 keV for eBOSS
(z < 4.5) + XQ-100. Finally, we give the correlation coefficients between the free parameters
of the fit in appendix B. The 1/mX parameter does not exhibit significant correlation with
any of the parameters describing the thermal history.
As our most robust bound on WDM, we therefore take the eBOSS (z < 4.5) + XQ-100
configuration, marginalizing over the cosmological, astrophysical and nuisance parameters
described in table 1. This leads to mX > 5.3 keV (95% CL), or equivalently to a constraint
on the mass of a non-resonantly produced sterile neutrino ms > 34 keV (95% CL).

Conclusions

In this paper, we present an update of the constraints we derive on several cosmological
parameters using Lyman-α data, either alone or in combination with CMB and BAO data.
Compared to the previous study of PY15 [17], we update both large-scale and small-scale
data sets: we use the most recent 1D Lyman-α flux power spectrum measured with the DR14
BOSS and eBOSS data of the SDSS, as well as the newest Planck 2018 data release.
We perform two statistical analyses in parallel: one based on a Bayesian and the other
on a frequentist interpretation. The two approaches produce results that are in excellent
agreement, demonstrating the robustness of the study. In order to be conservative, we choose
to always report P
as our final result the largest (and hence weakest) bound, whether on the
neutrino masses
mν or on the inverse of the mass of a thermal relic 1/mX .

We find a mild tension between the values of Ωm preferred by the Lyman-α and the
CMB data. Interestingly, the Lyman-α best-fit cosmological parameters are in very good
agreement with current weak lensing constraints on (Ωm , σ8 ). Lyman-α and weak lensing are
two late-time probes of a similar range of scales, and they show a comparable level of tension
with Planck ΛCDM model at the 2 − 3 σ level. Because Ωm and ns have a similar impact on
the Lyman-α flux power spectrum, the small tension on Ωm is likely to have the same origin
as the mild tension on ns previously observed by PY15 [17].
We performed comprehensive tests and did not identify a systematic effect in the data or
in the analysis that would be the origin of this tension. However, we showed that it could be
reduced by considering different scalar indices on CMB and Lyman-α scales, such as produced
by a running of the scalar index. We find a mild preference for a non-zero running of ns at the
level of about 3σ: dns /d ln k ∼ −0.010 ± 0.004. This detection is consistent with the previous
study of PY15. It illustrates the small disagreement in the slopes of the power spectrum
measured independently by BOSS/eBOSS and Planck.
The free-streaming of massive neutrinos causes a step-like suppression in the power
spectrum that is ideally probed by P
comparing the large-scale CMB to the small scale Lyman-α
power spectra. The constraint on
mν thus comes
P from the measurement of σ8 in Lyman-α
data, and from the correlation between σ8 and mν provided by CMB. The value of σ8 is
derived from the normalization of the 1D flux power spectrum, which is essentially unaffected
by the inclusion or not of a variation in the slope of the power spectrum, as in the case of
non-zero running.
PCombining BOSS and eBOSS Lyman-α with Planck CMB data, we find an upper bound
on
mν of 0.10 eV (95% CL) for a ΛCDM model, which only loosens to 0.11 eV when
allowing
for running. When further including CMB lensing and BAO, the limit tightens to
P
mν < 0.09 eV, whether or not running is allowed. These limits improve slightly over those
of PY15 and tend to favor the normal hierarchy neutrino mass scenario.
WDM affects clustering compared to the CDM scenario by suppressing all power below
a scale determined by the particle mass. Thanks to the much improved statistics, the DR14
BOSS and eBOSS data allow us to improve the limit on WDM compared to previous publications. Using a combination of eBOSS (z < 4.5) + XQ-100 Lyman-α data, we constrain the
mass mX of a thermal relic to mX > 5.3 keV (95% CL). It translates to a constraint on the
mass ms of a non-resonantly-produced sterile neutrino of ms > 34 keV (95% CL).
The study presented in this work probably provides one of the most stringent bound on
mν that current high-statistics medium-resolution data can provide. WDM constraints,
less sensitive to low-redshift data more prone to systematics, could still be further improved,
for instance with additional high redshift data. We see two main paths for improvement in
the near future. First, new-generation spectroscopic data from DESI, WEAVE, or 4MOST
will soon be available. With a three to four-fold increase in quasar number density, it will be
possible to further tighten the selection of the quasar spectra and reduce the contamination
from systematic biases. With DESI, the factor of two gain in P
resolution and the reduced
noise will improve the measurement on small scales relevant for
mν . The extension of the
DESI quasar selection to higher redshift is highly relevant to WDM. Secondly, improvements
are also expected on the simulations side. The use of faster and less memory-intensive codes
will allow one to run large-volume hydrodynamic cosmological resolution with the required
P

– 25 –

resolution without having to resort to splicing techniques. Emulator-based techniques can
reduce the uncertainties in the model interpolation and bring them at thePsub-percent level.
Combined, these improvements should allow us to enter the era where
mν is no longer
constrained but measured.

Thermal history

We model the IGM thermal history through a set of parameters given in table 1. The recovered
range of the IGM temperature T (z), density dependence γ(z)
P and mean flux F (z) are shown
in figure 9 for the fits on the sum of the neutrino masses
mν , and in figure 10 for the fit
on the mass of a warm dark matter thermal relic. Current measurements of these parameters
exhibit a wide spread. Values of T0 vary among authors by over a factor 2 (typically between
about 10 000K and 20 000K for redshifts between 2 and 3, decreasing with redshift to around
8 000K at z = 4), and γ can be found between 1.0 and 1.8 [43, 83, 84]. The central simulation
of our simulation grid corresponds to the thermal model of [40]. For the purpose of this
study, thermal parameters are taken as nuisance and we do not try to recover precise values.
Instead, we allow for a lot of freedom in their range and modeling.

history. However, we note that adding them reduces the uncertainty on the thermal parameters through their correlation with cosmological parameters. The main impact is for γ, where
its anti-correlation with ΩM and ns , combined with the light tension between Lyman-α and
CMB data on these parameters, pushes it to low values in the Lyman-α +P18 neutrino mass
fit. In contrast, Lyman-α data alone yield perfectly standard values of γ, T0 and F (z).
To further check the robustness of our results, we tested a different, less flexible, thermal
model. Instead of the one described by the parameters of table 1 that leave the slopes of the
redshift-dependence free, we fixed the shape of the thermal history to that of [40] used in the
central simulation, and we only allowed changes in amplitude and density dependence of the
UV heating rates (AMPL and GRAD parameters of Gadget), effectively changing T0 and
γ at all redshifts. The limits obtained in this case are summarized in table 10. We note that
the recovered thermal history is in excellent agreement with that of the central simulation
in all cases. While considerably reduced, the trends noticed above when we P
included Planck
data are still true (in particular a slightly lower value of γ). The bound on
mν is slightly
tightened when imposing the more constrained thermal model. The looser fit of the paper
therefore yields conservative bounds. The warm dark matter results are only mildly changed.

We provide the correlation coefficients between fit parameters in the case of the
mν fit to
Lyman-α data alone in table 11, and in the case of the 1 keV/mX fit to Lyman-α (z < 4.5)
+ XQ100 data in table 12. For the sake of clarity, we restrict the table to matrix rows and
columns that exhibit at least one coefficient with absolute value exceeding 25%, and we only
show coefficients larger than 20% in absolute value.

Table 12. As table 11 for the WDM fit on Lyman-α (z < 4.5) + XQ100.

P
In the
mν fit, the cosmological parameters show correlation with some of the astrophysical or nuisance parameters, but never at a level exceeding 50%. The largest such
correlations are between ns and Aτ (-48%), between σ8 and η T (z < 3) (-43%), and between

– 29 –

ns and η T (z < 3) (43%). All other correlations with cosmological parameters are below 40%.
In contrast, astrophysical and nuisance parameters show larger degeneracies, often in excess
of 50% correlations. This is why, in particular, we do not have any claims on thermal history
but instead consider parameters that describe it as nuisance, which we marginalize over (in
the Bayesian approach) or leave free in the fit (in the frequentist approach).
In the WDM fit, mX is only slightly correlated to the mean flux (27% with Aτ and
−32% with η τ ) and to ns (−21%). We find no significant correlation of mX with any of the
parameters describing the thermal history.
