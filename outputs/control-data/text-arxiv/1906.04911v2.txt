Abstract
We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for periodic and for elliptic periodic trajectories of billiards within an ellipse in the Minkowski plane in terms of an underlining
elliptic curve. We provide several examples of periodic and elliptic periodic trajectories
with small periods. We observe relationship between Cayley-type conditions and discriminantly separable and factorizable polynomials. Equivalent conditions for periodicity and
elliptic periodicity are derived in terms of polynomial-functional equations as well. The
corresponding polynomials are related to the classical extremal polynomials. In particular, the light-like periodic trajectories are related to the classical Chebyshev polynomials.
The similarities and differences with respect to previously studied Euclidean case are
indicated.

Introduction

Billiards within quadrics in pseudo-Euclidean spaces were studied in [KT2009,DR2012,DR2013].
In [DR2019a, DR2019b], the relationship between the billiards within quadrics in the Euclidean
spaces and extremal polynomials has been studied. The aim of this paper is to develop the
connection between extremal polynomials and billiards in the Minkowski plane.
This paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we recall the basic notions connected
with the Minkowski plane, confocal families of conics, relativistic ellipses and hyperbolas, and
billiards. In Section 3, we give a complete description of the periodic billiard trajectories in
algebro-geometric terms. In Section 4, we use the conditions obtained in the previous section
to study examples of periodic trajectories with small periods.
We also emphasize intriguing connection between the Cayley-type conditions and discriminantly separable polynomials. The notion of relativistic ellipses and hyperbolas enables definition of Jacobi-type elliptic coordinates in the Minkowski setting. Since the correspondence
between Cartesian and elliptic coordinates is not one-to-one, there is a notion of elliptic periodicity which refers to a weaker assumption that a trajectory is periodic in elliptic coordinates. In
Section 5, we provide algebro-geometric characterization of trajectories to be n-elliptic periodic
without being n-periodic. Section 6 provides examples and connections with discriminantly
separable polynomials. In Section 7, we derive a characterisation of elliptic periodic trajectories using polynomial equations. In the last Section 8, we establish the connection between
characteristics of periodic billiard trajectories and extremal polynomials: the Zolotarev polynomials, the Akhiezer polynomials on symmetric intervals, and the general Akhiezer polynomials
on two intervals. We conclude our study of the relationship of billiards in the Minkowski plane
with the extremal polynomials by relating the case of light-like trajectories to the classical
Chebyshev polynomials, see Section 9.
Apart from similarities with previously studied Euclidean spaces, see [DR2019a, DR2019b],
there are also significant differences: for example, among the obtained extremal polynomials
are such with winding numbers (3, 1), which was never the case in the Euclidean setting.

Confocal families of conics and billiards

The Minkowski plane is R2 with the Minkowski scalar product:
p hX, Y i = X1 Y1 − X2 Y2 .
The Minkowski distance between points X, Y is dist(X, Y ) = hX − Y, X − Y i. Since the
scalar product can be negative, notice that the Minkowski distance can have imaginary values
2

as well. In that case, we choose the value of the square root with the positive imaginary part.
Let ℓ be a line in the Minkowski plane, and v its vector. ℓ is called space-like if hv, vi > 0;
time-like if hv, vi < 0; and light-like if hv, vi = 0. Two vectors x, y are orthogonal in the
Minkowski plane if hx, yi = 0. Note that a light-like vector is orthogonal to itself.
Confocal families. Denote by

x2 y 2
E :
+
=1
a
b
an ellipse in the plane, with a, b being fixed positive numbers.
The associated family of confocal conics is:

Cλ

x2
y2
:

a−λ b+λ

λ ∈ R.

(2.1)

(2.2)

The family is shown on Figure 1. We may distinguish the following three subfamilies in the

Figure 1: Family of confocal conics in the Minkowski plane. Solid lines represent relativistic
ellipses, and dashed ones relativistic hyperbolas.
family (2.2): for λ ∈ (−b, a), conic Cλ is an ellipse; for λ < −b, conic Cλ is a hyperbola with
x-axis as the major one; for λ > a, it is a hyperbola again, but now its major axis is y-axis. In
addition, there are three degenerated quadrics: Ca , Cb , C∞ corresponding to y-axis, x-axis, and
the line at the infinity respectively.
√
√
√
The √
confocal family has three pairs of foci: F1 ( a + b, 0), F2 (− a + b, 0); G1 (0, a + b),
G2 (0, − a + b); and H1 (1 : −1 : 0), H2 (1 : 1 : 0) on the line at the infinity.
We notice four distinguished lines:
√
√
x + y = a + b, x + y = − a + b,
√
√
x − y = a + b, x − y = − a + b.

These lines are common tangents to all conics from the family.
Conics in the Minkowski plane have geometric properties analogous to the conics in the
Euclidean plane. Namely, for each point on conic
√ Cλ , either sum or difference of its Minkowski
distances from the foci F1 and F2 is equal to 2 √a − λ; either sum or difference of the distances
from the other pair of foci G1 , G2 is equal to 2 −b − λ [DR2012].
In the Minkowkski plane, it is natural to consider relativistic conics, which are suggested in
[BM1962]. In this section,
of the related analysis.
√ we give a brief account
√
Consider points F1 ( a + b, 0) and F2 (− a + b, 0).
For a given constant c ∈ R+ ∪ iR+ , a relativistic ellipse is the set of points X satisfying
dist(F1 , X) + dist(F2 , X) = 2c, while a relativistic hyperbola is the union of the sets given by
the following equations:
dist(F1 , X) − dist(F2 , X) = 2c,
dist(F2 , X) − dist(F1 , X) = 2c.
Relativistic conics can be described as follows.
√
0 < c < a + b The corresponding relativistic conics lie on ellipse Ca−c2 from family (2.2). The
ellipse Ca−c2 is split into four arcs by touching points with the four common tangent lines;
thus, the relativistic ellipse is the union of the two arcs intersecting the y-axis, while the
relativistic hyperbola is the union of the other two arcs.
√
c > a + b The relativistic conics lie on Ca−c2 – a hyperbola with x-axis as the major one. Each
branch of the hyperbola is split into three arcs by touching points with the common tangents; thus, the relativistic ellipse is the union of the two finite arcs, while the relativistic
hyperbola is the union of the four infinite ones.
c is imaginary The relativistic conics lie on hyperbola Ca−c2 – a hyperbola with y-axis as the
major one. As in the previous case, the branches are split into six arcs in total by common
points with the four tangents. The relativistic ellipse is the union of the four infinite arcs,
while the relativistic hyperbola is the union of the two finite ones.
Notice that all relativistic ellipses are disjoint with each other, as well as all relativistic
hyperbolas, see Figure 1. Moreover, at the intersection point of a relativistic ellipse which is
a part of the geometric conic Cλ1 from the confocal family (2.2) and a relativistic hyperbola
belonging to Cλ2 , it is always λ1 < λ2 .
Elliptic coordinates. Each point inside ellipse E has elliptic coordinates (λ1 , λ2 ), such that
−b < λ1 < 0 < λ2 < a.
The differential equation of the lines touching a given conic Cγ is:
p

dλ1
dλ2
+p
= 0.
(a − λ1 )(b + λ1 )(γ − λ1 )
(a − λ2 )(b + λ2 )(γ − λ2 )

Billiards. Let v be a vector and p a line in the Minkowski plane. Decompose vector v into
the sum v = a + np of a vector np orthogonal to p and a belonging to p. Then vector v ′ = a − np
is the billiard reflection of v on p. It is easy to see that v is also the billiard reflection of v ′ with
respect to p. Moreover, since hv, vi = hv ′ , v ′i, vectors v, v ′ are of the same type.
Note that v = v ′ if v is contained in p and v ′ = −v if it is orthogonal to p. If np is light-like,
which means that it belongs to p, then the reflection is not defined.

Line ℓ′ is the billiard reflection of ℓ off ellipse E if their intersection point ℓ ∩ ℓ′ belongs to
E and the vectors of ℓ, ℓ′ are reflections of each other with respect to the tangent line of E at
this point.
The lines containing segments of a given billiard trajectory within E are all of the same
type: they are all either space-like, time-like, or light-like. For the detailed explanation, see
[KT2009].
Billiard trajectories within ellipses in the Minkowski plane have caustic properties: each
segment of a given trajectory will be tangent to the same conic confocal with the boundary, see
[DR2012]. More about Minkowski plane or higher-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean spaces and
related integrable systems can be found in [BM1962, GKT2007, WFS+ 2009, JJ2015, JJ2017].

Periodic trajectories

Sections 3–8 deal with the trajectories with non-degenerate caustic Cγ , which will mean that
γ ∈ R \ {−b, a}. Such trajectories are either space-like or time-like. The case of light-like
trajectories, which correspond to the degenerate caustic C∞ is considered separately, in Section
9.
The periodic trajectories of elliptical billiards in the Minkowski plane can be characterized
in algebro-geometric terms using the underlying elliptic curve:
Theorem 3.1 The billiard trajectories within E with non-degenerate caustic Cγ are n-periodic
if and only if nQ0 ∼ nQγ on the elliptic curve:
C : y 2 = ε(a − x)(b + x)(γ − x),

(3.1)

with Q0 being a point of C corresponding to x = 0, Qγ to x = γ, and ε = sign γ.
Proof. Along a billiard trajectory within E with caustic Cγ , the elliptic coordinate λ1 traces the
segment [α1 , 0], and λ2 the segment [0, β1 ], where α1 is the largest negative and β1 the smallest
positive member of the set {a, −b, γ}.
Case 1. If Cγ is an ellipse and γ < 0, then α1 = γ, β1 = a. The coordinate λ1 takes value
λ1 = γ at the touching points with the caustic and value λ1 = 0 at the reflection points off the
arcs of E where the restricted metric is time-like. On the other hand, λ2 takes value λ2 = a
at the intersections with y-axis, and λ2 = 0 at the reflection points off the arcs of E where the
restricted metric is space-like.
Case 2. If Cγ is an ellipse and γ > 0, then α1 = −b, β1 = γ. The coordinate λ1 takes value
λ1 = −b at the intersections with x-axis and value λ1 = 0 at the reflection points off the arcs
of E where the restricted metric is time-like. On the other hand, λ2 takes value λ2 = γ at the
touching points with the caustic, and λ2 = 0 at the reflection points off the arcs of E where the
restrictes metric is space-like.
Case 3. If Cγ is a hyperbola, then α1 = −b, β1 = a. The coordinate λ1 takes value λ1 = −b
at the intersections with x-axis and value λ1 = 0 at the reflection points off the arcs of E where
the restricted metric is time-like. On the other hand, λ2 takes value λ2 = a at the intersections
with y-axis, and λ2 = 0 at the reflection points off the arcs of E where the restricted metric is
space-like.
In each case, the elliptic coordinates change monotonously between their extreme values.
Consider an n-periodic billiard trajectory and denote by n1 the number of reflections off
time-like arcs, i.e. off relativistic ellipses, and by n2 the number of reflections off space-like arcs,

i.e. relativistic hyperbolas. Obviously, n1 + n2 = n. Integrating (2.3) along the trajectory, we
get:

(3.2)
ε(a − λ1 )(b + λ1 )(γ − λ1 )
ε(a − λ2 )(b + λ2 )(γ − λ2 )
α1
β1
i.e.

n1 (Q0 − Qα1 ) + n2 (Q0 − Qβ1 ) ∼ 0.

In Case 1, this is equivalent to

n1 (Q0 − Qγ ) + n2 (Q0 − Qa ) ∼ n(Q0 − Qγ ),
since a closed trajectory crosses the y-axis even number of times, i.e n2 must be even, and
2Qa ∼ 2Qγ .
Similarly, in Case 2, it follows since n1 is even, and in Case 3 both n1 and n2 need to be
even.

From the proof of Theorem 3.1, we have:
Corollary 3.2 The period of a closed trajectory with hyperbola as caustic is even.
Theorem 3.3 The billiard trajectories within E with caustic Cγ are n-periodic if and only if:
C2 = 0,

B3 = 0,

the Taylor expansions around x = 0.

Proof. Denote by Q∞ the point of C (3.1) corresponding to x = ∞ and notice that
2Qγ ∼ 2Q∞ .

(3.3)

Consider first n even. Because of (3.3), the condition nQ0 ∼ nQγ is equivalent to nQ0 ∼
nQ∞ , which is equivalent to the existence of a meromorphic function of C with the unique pole
at Q∞ and unique zero at Q0 , such that the pole and the zero are both of multiplicity n. The
basis of L (nQ∞ ) is:
1, x, x2 , . . . , xn/2 , y, xy, xn/2−2y,
(3.4)
thus a non-trivial linear combination

Now, suppose n is odd. Because of (3.3), the condition nQ0 ∼ nQγ is equivalent to nQ0 ∼
(n − 1)Q∞ + Qγ , which is equivalent to the existence of a meromorphic function of C with only
two poles: of order n − 1 at Q∞ and a simple pole at Qγ , and unique zero at Q0 . The basis

There is a 3-periodic trajectory of the billiard within (2.1), with a non-degenerate caustic Cγ
in the Minkowski plane if and only if, according to Theorem (3.3), the caustic is an ellipse,

Since γ1 ∈ (−b, 0), γ3 ∈ (0, a) and γ2 ∈

conics Cγ1 and Cγ3 are ellipses.
In Figures 3 and 4, examples of a 4-periodic trajectories with each type of caustic are shown.

The first factor, −(a + b)2 γ 2 + 2ab(a − b)γ + 3a2 b2 , is a constant multiple of C2 (see Equation
(4.1)), thus it produces 3-periodic trajectories, which have already been studied.
The discriminant of the third factor (a + b)2 γ 2 + 2ab(a − b)γ + a2 b2 is −16a3 b3 , which is
negative, therefore the expression has no real roots in γ.
Next, we consider the second factor: (a + b)(a − 3b)γ 2 + 2ab(a + b)γ + a2 b2 = 0, which has

Cayley-type conditions and discriminantly separable polynomials

Similarly to the case of Euclidean plane [DR2019b], the Cayley-type conditions obtained above
have a very interesting algebraic structure. Namely, the numerators of the corresponding expressions are polynomials in 3 variables. As examples below show, those polynomials have
factorizable discriminants which, after a change of varibles, lead to discriminantly separable
polynomials in the sense of the following definition.
Definition 4.1 ([Dra2010]) A polynomial F (x1 , . . . , xn ) is discriminantly separable if there
exist polynomials f1 (x1 ), . . . , fn (xn ) such that the discriminant Dxi F of F with respect to xi
satisfies:
Dxi F (x1 , . . . , x̂i , . . . , xn ) =

Y

fj (xj ),

j6=i

for each i = 1, . . . , n.

Discriminantly factorizable polynomials were introduced in [Dra2012] in connection with nvalued groups. Various applications of discriminantly separable polynomials in continuous and
discrete integrable systems were presented in [DK2014a, DK2014b, DK2017]. The connection
between Cayley-type conditions in the Euclidean setting and discriminantly factorizable and
separable polynomials has been observed in [DR2019b]. As examples below show, the Cayley
conditions in the Minkowski plane provide examples of discriminantly factorisable polynomials
which, after a change of variables, have separable discriminants. It would be interesting to
establish this relationship as a general statement.
Example 4.2 The expression (4.1) is:
G2 (γ, a, b) = − (a + b)2 γ 2 + 2 ab (a − b) γ + 3 a2 b2 ,
and its discriminant with respect to γ:

which is obviously factorizable.


Dγ G2 = 24 a2 + ab + b2 a2 b2 ,

14

Example 4.3 The expression (4.3) is:
G3 (γ, a, b) = −(ab + aγ + bγ)(ab + aγ − bγ)(ab − aγ − bγ)

and its discriminant with respect to γ is factored as:

Dγ G3 = 26 a8 b8 (a + b)2 .
Example 4.4 The expression (4.5) is:
G6 (γ, a, b) = (a + b)6 γ 6 − 2ab (a − b) (a − 3b) (3a − b) (a + b)2 γ 5

− a2 b2 29a2 − 54ab + 29b2 (a + b)2 γ 4 − 36a3 b3 (a − b) (a + b)2 γ 3

− a4 b4 9a2 + 34ab + 9b2 γ 2 + 10a5 b5 (a − b) γ + 5a6 b6 .

is discriminantly factorizable since its discriminant with respect to γ is:

Dγ G6 = −5 · 244 (27a6 + 81a5 b + 322 a4 b2 + 509a3 b3 + 322a2 b4 + 81ab5 + 27b6 ) (a + b)8 b38 a38 .

Example 4.5 Let us denote the expression (4.6) as:

G8 (γ, a, b) =(3a − b)(a − 3b)(a + b)6 γ 8 + 8ab(a − b)(a + b)6 γ 7

− 4 a2 b2 (3 a4 − 24 a3 b + 10 a2 b2 − 24 ab3 + 3 b4 ) (a + b)2 γ 6



− 10 a4 b4 11 a2 − 18 ab + 11 b2 (a + b)2 γ 4 − 72 a5 b5 (a − b) (a + b)2 γ 3
− 4 a6 b6 (a + 3 b) (3 a + b) γ 2 + 8 a7 b7 (a − b)γ + 3 a8 b8

We find that the discriminant of G8 with respect to γ factors as:

Dγ G8 = −288 a2 + ab + b2 (a + b)18 b74 a74 .
Example 4.6 The discriminant Dγ G12 of the expression in (4.7) is:

Dγ G12 = − 2184 · 72 (a + b)40 (ab)172 ×
× (84375a12 + 506250a11 b + 4266243 a10b2 + 16690590 a9b3 + 34989622 a8b4

so G15 is a discriminantly factorizable polynomial.
Remark 4.8 Since the determinants obtained in Theorem 3.3 are symmetric in a, −b, and γ,
the discriminants with respect to a and b of the polynomials in Examples 4.2–4.7 will be also
factorizable.
Remark 4.9 We observed in the Examples 4.2–4.7 that all polynomials are discriminantly

Elliptic periodic trajectories

Points of the plane which are symmetric with respect to the coordinate axes share the same
elliptic coordinates, thus there is no bijection between the elliptic and the Cartesian coordinates.
Thus, we introduce a separate notion of periodicity in elliptic coordinates.
Definition 5.1 A billiard trajectory is n-elliptic periodic if it is n-periodic in elliptic coordinates joined to the confocal family (2.2).
Now, we will derive algebro-geometric conditions for elliptic periodic trajectories.
Theorem 5.2 A billiard trajectory within E with the caustic Cγ is n-elliptic periodic without
being n-periodic if and only if one of the following conditions is satisfied on C :
(a) Cγ is an ellipse, 0 < γ < a, and nQ0 − (n − 1)Qγ − Q−b ∼ 0;
(b) Cγ is an ellipse, −b < γ < 0, and nQ0 − (n − 1)Qγ − Qa ∼ 0;
(c) Cγ is a hyperbola, n is even and nQ0 − (n − 2)Qγ − Q−b − Qa ∼ 0;
(d) Cγ is a hyperbola, n is odd, and nQ0 − (n − 1)Qγ − Qa ∼ 0;
(e) Cγ is a hyperbola, n is odd, and nQ0 − (n − 1)Qγ − Q−b ∼ 0.
Moreover, such trajectories are always symmetric with respect to the origin in Case (c). They
are symmetric with respect to the x-axis in Cases (b) and (d), and with respect to the y-axis in
Cases (a) and (e).
Proof. Let M0 be the initial point of a given n-elliptic periodic trajectory, and M1 the next
point on the trajectory with the same elliptic coordinates. Then, integrating (2.3) M0 to M1
along the trajectory, we get:
n1 (Q0 − Qα1 ) + n2 (Q0 − Qβ1 ) ∼ 0,
16

where n = n1 + n2 , and n1 is the number of times that the particle hit the arcs of E with timelike metrics, and n2 the number of times it hit the arcs with space-like metrics. We denoted by
α1 the largest negative member of the set {a, −b, γ}, and by β1 its smallest positive member.
The trajectory is not n-periodic if and only if at least one of n1 , n2 is odd, which then leads
to the stated conclusions.

Discriminantly separable polynomials and elliptic periodicity
Since the case n = 2 is trivial, we start with the case n = 3.
From (6.1) and (6.2), we have:
G1 (a, b, γ) = −(a + b)(3a − b)γ 2 − 2ab(a + b)γ + a2 b2 ,
G2 (a, b, γ) = (a + b)(a − 3b)γ 2 + 2ab(a + b)γ + a2 b2 ,
and we calculate the discriminants, which factorize as follows:
Dγ G1 = 16a3 b2 (a + b),

Dγ G2 = 16b3 a2 (a + b).

After corollary 7.2 and relation (7.1), we see that the Pell equations arise as the functional
polynomial conditions for periodicity. Let us recall some important properties of the solutions
of the Pell equations.

Classical Extremal Polynomials and Caustics

8.1

Fundamental Properties of Extremal Polynomials

From the previous section we know that the Pell equation plays a key role in functionalpolynomial formulation of periodicity conditions in the Minkowski plane. The solutions of the
Pell equation are so-called extremal polynomials. Denote {c1 , c2 , c3 , c4 } = {0, 1/a, −1/b, 1/γ}
with the ordering c1 < c2 < c3 < c4 . The polynomials p̂n are so called generalized Chebyshev
polynomials on two intervals [c1 , c2 ] ∪ [c3 , c4 ], with an appropriate normalization. Namely, one
can consider the question of finding the monic polynomial of certain degree n which minimizes
the maximum norm on the union of two intervals. Denote such a polynomial as P̂n and its norm
Ln . The fact that polynomial p̂n is a solution of the Pell equation on the union of intervals
[c1 , c2 ] ∪ [c3 , c4 ] is equivalent to the following conditions:
(i) p̂n = P̂n / ± Ln
(ii) the set [c1 , c2 ] ∪ [c3 , c4 ] is the maximal subset of R for which P̂n is the minimal polynomial
in the sense above.

28

Chebyshev was the first who considered a similar problem on one interval, and this was
how celebrated Chebyshev polynomials emerged in XIXth century. Let us recall a fundamental
result about generalized Chebyshev polynomials [Ahi1947, Akh1990].
Theorem 8.1 (A corollary of the Krein-Levin-Nudelman Theorem [KLN1990]) A polynomial Pn of degree n satisfies a Pell equation on the union of intervals [c1 , c2 ] ∪ [c3 , c4 ] if and
only if there exists an integer n1 such that the equation holds:
Z c3
Z ∞
C
n1
fˆ(s)ds = n
fˆ(s)ds, fˆ(s) = qQ
.
(8.1)

c2
c4
(s
−
c
)
i
i=1
(Here C is a nonessential constant.) The modulus of the polynomial reaches its maximal values
Ln at the points ci : |Pn (ci )| = Ln .
In addition, there are exactly τ1 = n − n1 − 1 internal extremal points of the interval [c3 , c4 ]
where |Pn | reaches the value Ln , and there are τ2 = n1 − 1 internal extremal points of [c1 , c2 ]
with the same property.

Definition 8.2 ([RR2014, DR2019a, DR2019b]) We call the pair (n, n1 ) the partition and (τ1 , τ2 )
the signature of the generalized Chebyshev polynomial Pn .
Now we are going to formulate and prove the main result of this Section, which relates n1 , n2
the numbers of reflections off relativistic ellipses and off relativistic hyperbolas respectively with
the partition and the signature of the related solution of a Pell equation.
Theorem 8.3 Given a periodic billiard trajectory with period n = n1 + n2 , where n1 is the
number of reflections off relativistic ellipses, n2 the number of reflections off the relativistic
hyperbolas, then the partition corresponding to this trajectory is (n, n1 ). The corresponding
extremal polynomial p̂n of degree n has n1 − 1 internal extremal points in the first interval and
n − n1 − 1 = n2 − 1 internal extremal points in the second interval.
Proof. Recall that c1 < c2 < c3 < c4 . From the equation (3.2), one has:

In particular, for n = 3, if the caustic Cγ is an ellipse with γ < 0, then n1 = 1. Such
polynomials and corresponding partitions (3, 1) do not arise in the study of Euclidean billiard
trajectories. On the other hand, if the caustic Cγ is an ellipse with γ > 0, we have n1 = 2.
Such polynomials for γ > 0 can be explicitly expressed in terms of the Zolatarev polynomials,
see Proposition 8.4. Since their partition is (3, 2), they appeared before in the Euclidean case
(see [DR2019b]). The corresponding extremal polynomials p̂3 in both cases γ < 0 and γ > 0
are shown in Figure 22. We will provide in Proposition 8.12 the explicit formulae for such
polynomials in terms of the general Akhiezer polynomials.

Let us recall that the Chebyshev polynomials Tn (x), n = 0, 1, 2, . . . defined by the recursion:
T0 (x) = 1,

T1 (x) = x,

Tn+1 (x) + Tn−1 (x) = 2xTn (x),

polynomials Ln Tn (x) are characterized as the solutions of the following minmax problem:
find the polynomial of degree n with the leading coefficient equal 1 which minimizes the
uniform norm on the interval [−1, 1].

8.2

Zolotarev polynomials

Following the ideas of Chebyshev, his student Zolotarev posed and solved a handful of problems,
including the following ([Ahi1947, DR2019b]):
For the given real parameter σ and all polynomials of degree n of the form:
p(x) = xn − nσxn−1 + p2 xn−2 + . . . pn ,

(8.7)

find the one with the minimal uniform norm on the interval [−1, 1].
Denote this minimal uniform norm as Ln = L(σ, n).
For σ > tan2 (π/2n), the solution zn has the following property ([Ahi1947], p. 298, Fig. 9):
Π1 – The equation zn (x) = Ln has n − 2 double solutions in the open interval (−1, 1) and
simple solutions at −1, 1, α, β, where 1 < α < β, while in the union of the intervals [−1, 1]∪[α, β]
the inequality zn2 ≤ Ln is satisfied and zn > Ln in the complement.

In order to derive the formulas for p̂3 in terms of z3 , let us construct an affine transformation:

We immediately get

Now we get the following

Proposition 8.4 The polynomial p̂3 can be expressed through the Zolotarev polynomial z3 up

p̂3 (s) ∼ z3 (2bs + 1).
To verify the proposition, we should certify that the definition of α and β from (8.9) for
n = 3 and the relations (8.10), (8.11) are compatible with the formula for γ we got before as
Cayley condition, see (4.2).
In order to do that we will use well-known identities for the Jacobi elliptic functions:

then from the previous two relations we get as in ([DR2019b]):

We can express κ in terms of Y and get:

By plugging the last relation into (8.9) for n = 3 we get

Since, at the same time from the Cayley condition we have α = 2t + 1, with t = b/a, we can
express Y in terms of t:

(8.20)

We see that the last formula with the choice of the + sign corresponds to a formula for β from
(8.11). This formula relates β and γ from the Caley condition (4.2). From (8.20), taking the
positive sign in β yields,
√

(8.23)

In order to show that the two expressions in (8.22) and (8.23) are identical, we simplify their
difference that yields zero. This finalizes the verification. (One can observe that the − sign
option from the formula (8.20) would correspond to the − sign in the formula for γ (4.2).
Among the polynomials p̂n the property of type Π1 can be attributed only to those with
n = 2k + 1 and winding numbers (2k + 1, 2k), in other words to those with the signature
(0, 2k − 1).

Akhiezer polynomials on symmetric intervals [−1, −α] ∪ [α, 1]

The problem of finding polynomials of degree n with the leading coefficient 1 and minimizing
the uniform norm on the union of two symmetric intervals [−1, −α] ∪ [α, 1], for given 0 < α < 1
appeared to be of a significant interest in radio-techniques applications. Following the ideas of
Chebyshev and Zolotarev, Akhiezer derived in 1928 the explicit formulae for such polynomials
An (x; α) with the deviation Ln (α) [Ahi1947, Akh1990].
These formulas are especially simple in the case of even degrees n = 2m, when Akhiezer
polynomials A2m are obtained by a quadratic substitution from the Chebyshev polynomial Tm :

(b) The maximum of the modulus of T An on the union of the two intervals [−1, α] ∪ [β, 1] is

37

(c) The function T An takes values ±L with alternating signs at µ = n − m + 1 consecutive
points of the interval [−1, α] and at ν = m + 1 consecutive points of the interval [β, 1]. In
addition
T An (α, m, κ) = T An (β, m, κ) = (−1)m L,
and for any x ∈ (α, β), it holds:
(−1)m T An (x, m, κ) > L.
(d) Let F be a polynomial of degree n in x with the leading coefficient 1, such that:
i.) max|F (x)| = L for x ∈ [−1, α] ∪ [β, 1];
ii) F(x) takes values ±L with alternating signs at n-m+1 consecutives points of the interval
[−1, α] and at m+1 consecutive points of the interval [β, 1].
Then F (x) = T An (x, m, κ).
Let us determine the affine transformations when the caustic is an ellipse.
Case γ ∈ (−b, 0). For h : [−1, α] ∪ [β, 1] → [γ −1 , −b−1 ] ∪ [0, a−1 ], h(x) = âx + b̂, we get

(8.38)

Thus, we have two expressions for γ. One is from the Cayley condition (4.2) and the other is
from (8.36). Similarly as in Example 8.10, we can show that these two expressions are identical.

Periodic light-like trajectories and Chebyshev polynomials

The light-like billiard trajectories, by definition, have at each point the velocity v satisfying
hv, vi = 0. Their caustic is the conic at infinity C∞ . Since successive segments of such trajectories are orthogonal to each other, the light-like trajectories can close only after an even number
of reflections. In [DR2012, Theorem 3.3], it is proved that a light-like billiard trajectory within
E is periodic with even period n if and only if

For k not being relatively prime with n/2, the corresponding light-like trajectories are also
periodic, and their period is a divisor of n.
Applyin the limit γ → +∞ in Corollary 7.2, we get the following proposition.
Proposition 9.1 A light-like trajectory within ellipse E is periodic with period n = 2m if and
only if there exist real polynomials p̂m (s) and q̂m−1 (s) of degrees m and m − 1 respectively if
and only if:

The first condition from Proposition 9.1 is the standard Pell equation describing extremal
polynomials on one interval [−1/b, 1/a], thus the polynomials p̂m can be obtained as Chebyshev
polynomials composed with an affine transformation [−1/b, 1/a] → [−1, 1]. The additional
condition q̂m−1 (0) = 0, which is equivalent to p̂′m (0) = 0 implies an additional constraint on
parameters a and b. We have the following
