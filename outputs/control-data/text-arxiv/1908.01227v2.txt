Abstract: We investigate how the laws of gravity change in the DGP model, if we add
a second, parallel 3-brane, endowed with a localized gravitational curvature term. We
calculate the gravitational potential energy between two static point sources localized on
different branes. We discover a new length scale, which is equal to the geometric mean
of the DGP cross-over scale and the separation of the two branes in the extra dimension.
For distances, which are larger than this new length scale, we recover the original DGP
result, but for smaller distances the gravitational potential is weaker. Furthermore, a
region emerges, where a 4-dimensional observer measures a distance independent force.
We discuss a possible application of the present scenario for deriving rotation curves of
low surface brightness galaxies. Using the Kaluza-Klein description, we observe a curious
pattern, in which even and odd KK-modes contribute to the attractive and repulsive parts
of the gravitational potential, respectively. Finally, since this setup allows for the existence
of a sector of particle species that are interacting arbitrarily weakly with ‚Äùour‚Äù sector,
we discuss the implications of this phenomenon for black holes and the bound on the
number of species. We find that the behavior is qualitatively different from theories with
a normalizable zero-mode graviton.

Introduction

We investigate a particular setup in the braneworld scenario, where two flat (tensionless),
parallel 3-branes are embedded in a 4+1-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, where the
extra dimension is infinite. Apart from the addition of the 2nd brane,1 the scenario, which
we are considering here, is the same as in Ref. [2], where the original DGP model was
proposed. In the DGP model, there is a 5-dimensional (5-d) bulk theory, consisting of
the 5-d Einstein-Hilbert action with the fundamental Planck mass M‚àó , and an embedded,
tensionless 3-brane, which is endowed with a 4-d Einstein-Hilbert action with the observed
Planck mass MP :

In Ref. [1] a similar setup with two parallel branes has been investigated. However, there the extra
dimension is compact.

‚Äì1‚Äì

where y is the coordinate of the extra dimension, |G| is the determinant of the bulk metric,
R5 is the bulk Ricci scalar and |g| (with g¬µŒΩ (x¬µ ) = GAB (x¬µ , y = 0)) and R are the
respective quantities on the brane. Due to the localized curvature term (the second term
in (1.1)), the phenomenology of the DGP model is quite distinctive: Gravity behaves as
M2

5-dimensional for distances above the cross-over scale rc ‚â° MP3 , but changes the regime to
‚àó
4-dimensional behavior for distances below rc . We focus on the gravity part of the model,
although a localized matter action in (1.1) is assumed, which contains the Standard Model
(SM) fields.
Setups with parallel branes are interesting in several respects: One example is brane
inflation [3]. In that scenario, inflation in our universe could have been caused by a relative
motion between branes. Another example was given in Ref. [4], where it was suggested that
(anti-)baryons could be transported to such a parallel brane leading to a new mechanism
of baryogenesis on our brane.
The goal of the present paper is to show how the physical implications of the DGP
model are modified, if there exists a 2nd brane with a localized curvature term. In order
to study this, we will use a somewhat simplified model, explained in detail in Section 2,
and calculate the gravitational potential energy between two static point sources localized
on the opposite, parallel branes (in Section 3). We will find that the 2nd brane enhances
the effects of the DGP model by further weakening the 5-d gravity at certain distances.2
Furthermore, we will discover that the resulting gravitational potential gives rise to a
potentially, phenomenologically interesting new distance independent force in our universe.
Typically, in the context of extra dimensional models, the Kaluza-Klein (KK) language
is adopted, where the presence of the (geometrical) extra dimension is traded for the
presence of a tower of KK-modes, seen by a 4-d observer. Although such a viewpoint is
usually used in the case of a compact extra dimension (since in that case, one gets a discrete
mass spectrum), in Section 4 we will also make use of this KK language and re-derive our
results obtained in the fully 5-d treatment. Besides encountering some interesting features,
this equivalent viewpoint will serve as a cross-check for our main result.
Finally, we wish to address the question, what are the implications on the present
scenario coming from black hole (BH) physics. For general relativity (GR), or theories
that behave like GR up to some distance l‚àó , it has been shown [6‚Äì8] that BH physics (with
a BH size smaller than l‚àó ) puts a consistency bound on the short distance cutoff of GR,
namely
MP
Œõ. ‚àö ,
(1.2)
N
where Œõ is the gravity cutoff and N is the number of species in the theory.3 The physical
meaning of expression (1.2) is that the parameter Œõ‚àí1 marks the lower bound on the scale
of breakdown of semi-classical gravity. For example, the Hawking radiation from a black
hole of the size smaller than this scale cannot be treated as thermal, even approximately.
2

In the original DGP setup [2, 5] it has been found that the localized curvature term shields the short
distance physics on the brane from the strong gravity of the bulk.
3
As can be seen from Eq. (1.2), in theories with a large number of species N , the maximal cutoff can
be significantly lower than the Planck scale.

‚Äì2‚Äì

This is a clear signal that the theory of general relativity requires a UV-completion at
distances shorter than Œõ‚àí1 .
Furthermore, it has been shown in the context of an ADD-type model [9] (see also
[10‚Äì12]) that several setups with multiple branes, where a BH does not intersect with
all of the branes, are classically not static. It was shown that there is a classical time
scale, until which the BH will ‚Äùaccrete‚Äù all of the other branes.4 According to Ref. [9],
in the language of species, this can be understood as a ‚Äùdemocratization‚Äù process for
the BH in the following sense: A semi-classical, thermal, BH should evaporate into all
species ‚Äùdemocratically‚Äù (up to greybody factors). However, as long as the BH does not
intersect certain branes, it cannot evaporate into the species localized on them. So the
process of brane accretion restores that evaporation universality. In this view, the lack of
time-independence in the setup is reflected by the lack of universal evaporation.
However, theories of the form considered in the present work, differ from other extra
dimensional models (like the ADD model [13] or the RS model [14, 15]) in a very important
aspect: they modify gravity at large distances, while coinciding with GR at short distance
scales. Moreover, as opposed to the above outlined ‚Äùaccretion‚Äù scenario, where the tension
of the branes is responsible for the attraction between the BH and the branes, in our setup
the branes are tensionless. Nevertheless, we will show that there would be an (repulsive)
interaction between a BH and the branes. We can, however, switch that interaction off
by sending the distance between the branes to infinity. This is not possible in the ADD
model, because in that case we would need to send the compactification radius to infinity
as well, which would make 4-d gravity to vanish. So how does our scenario fit into the
above species picture? What, if any, information do we get from BH physics? We shall
address these issues in the last section of this paper and investigate the implications for
the bound on the number of species.

Two parallel DGP branes

As was explained in Ref. [2], in order to see the essential features of the DGP scenario,
it is enough to consider a toy model with a bulk scalar field and the respective kinetic
term(s) localized on the brane(s). The full theory, involving a spin-2 particle, will add a
tensor-structure to the scalar field propagator, but the essential results of the present work
will be unaffected.5 Hence, for clarity of presentation, we will exclusively deal with the
simplified scalar field theory in this paper.
The main contribution of the present work is to discuss a setup in the DGP braneworld
scenario, where an additional 3-brane is added, which is parallel (with respect to the extra
dimension) to the one representing our universe. The two branes are separated by a distance
R along the 5th dimension. In particular, we will consider the following scalar field theory:

In case the time scale is larger than the evaporation time, the BH will evaporate first.
Since we only consider the interaction between static sources, the full propagator (including the spin-2
and the spin-0 part) would modify our result by an O(1) numerical factor.

We defined rc ‚â° MP3 , the so-called cross-over length scale, which quantifies the relative
‚àó
strengths of the scalar field propagators on the brane and the bulk, respectively. This
simulates the relative strengths of the 4-d and the 5-d gravity in our toy model.
We want to calculate the potential energy (‚Äùwould-be‚Äù gravitational potential energy)
between two static point sources localized on the different branes, as shown in Figure 1.
In the next section we will perform the 5-d calculation, while in the following section
we will integrate out the extra dimension and use the KK language.

where ‚àÜ is the Laplace operator and G(~x, x~0 ; y, y 0 ) is the Green‚Äôs function. Although the
operator on the left hand side is not translationally invariant along the y-direction, we are
only interested in the setup, where one of the sources is located on the left brane at y 0 = 0
(and x~0 = 0), so the problem reduces to

With this normalization, in the limit R ‚Üí 0, where our system reduces to the original DGP setup, our
potential energy will be only half the value. This is easy to see, since for R ‚Üí 0, (2.1) reduces to the DGP
system with rc ‚Üí 2rc . However, with this choice we recover the usual Newton‚Äôs potential for close enough
point sources on our brane, as we will see in Subsection 3.2.

and it is weaker than the
which we would get without the DGP branes,

since rc œÅ  r2 +R2 . It is also weaker than the D
-potential, which has been found in Ref.
1
1
9
[5], because rc œÅ  rc D . There, it was argued that the DGP brane acts as a kind of
anti-gravity and reduces 5-d gravity to 4-d gravity (see next subsection). Now we find in
the present work that two branes enhance this effect and further weaken the 5-d gravity.
8

The sub-leading terms in this expression were extracted numerically. However, we can understand some
of their features from the following consideration. Note that in going from (3.6) to (3.13), we omitted terms
with positive (possible fractional) powers of r/R (and additional powers of R/rc ), which are subleading
in this regime. What is the next-to-leading power of r/R? On physical grounds, we know that the force
‚àÇ
(J/r) ‚Üí 0 for
along the brane should go to zero for r ‚Üí 0. Also, we can see from (3.6) explicitly that ‚àÇr
r ‚Üí 0. Hence we know that the leading correction (in r/R) to (3.13) has to vanish faster than quadratic.
From this argument it follows that the (magnitude of the) force in the regime r  R is bounded by the
(magnitude of the) force in regime R  r  œÅ and will approach zero eventually. However, to determine
how fast it will approach zero, we resort to a numerical analysis (see appendix A.1), which shows that the
leading correction in (3.13) is cubic in r/R (with a coefficient of order R/rc ).
9
There, the setup contains only one DGP brane and the potential energy is calculated between one point
source on the brane and a second point source outside the brane. D is the larger one of the distances either
along the 3-brane or along the extra dimension.

3.1

Screening of the 5-d force by the branes

In Ref. [5] the propagator for the DGP model (in the presence of one brane) between two
points at y and y0 along the extra dimension was calculated. It was approximated in the
regime r  rc (and hence krc  1) as

Although this result gives us the potential energy between two point sources, we can
interpret it as the potential due to one point source in the presence of a brane, because of
the following reason: For a static point source with mass m1 at (~r, y), the solution for the

But since our scalar field œÜ is essentially the graviton (see footnote 5), the gravitational
‚àí3/2
potential (not the potential energy) is M‚àó
œÜ, which is the same as m12 (1B) V (r; y, y0 )
(from (3.16)). Hence, expression (3.16) can be viewed as the potential energy of a (probe)
point mass m2 at (~x = ~0, y0 ) due to a point mass m1 at location
 (~r, y).

m2

We see that the resulting potential differs from a mere ‚àí M

‚àó r +(y‚àíy0 )
quite dramatically, due to the presence of the DGP-brane. The situation is similar to
the so-called image problem from classical electrostatics, so we can use that intuition to
interpret the present situation. There, we consider the situation of a point charge in the
presence of a perfectly conducting plate. The (positive) point charge induces a negative
charge on the plate and the resulting potential is the same as if a mirror image charge has
been introduced on the opposite side of the plate.
Similarly, the potential in the DGP scenario has a form, as if the brane introduced a
negative (anti-gravitating) mass on the opposite side of the brane (opposite to the probe
mass). For probe masses at y0 ‚â§ 0 (with the source m1 at positive y) the ‚Äùimage‚Äù mass
cancels the 5-d potential, while for probe masses at y0 > 0 the image mass enhances the
attraction between m1 and m2 .
However, there is an important difference to the situation in the electrostatics case. In
the DGP scenario there is still an attractive (but 4-d) potential left (since for |y| + |y0 |  r
1
the last term in (3.16) goes to r1c |y|+|y
). So, if we consider a point mass in the bulk near
0|
the brane, the brane will have a repulsive force on the point mass.
Now let us return to our two-branes setup. In the last section we found that in
the presence of two branes, the attractive potential between two point masses is further
reduced. So we can infer that the effect of the branes is to introduce even stronger repulsive
(anti-gravitating) point masses. Hence, if we would consider a point mass on our brane,

then the parallel brane (if it would be empty of sources) would be repelled.10 This repulsion
in our two-branes setup would be even greater than the repulsion between a brane and a
point source in empty space in the original DGP setup.
3.2

Force along the brane

Although the potential (3.15) is R-dependent, the sources in our scenario are, per construction, localized on the brane, so nothing can move into the bulk (except the graviton
itself). Put differently, every force, which is orthogonal to the brane, is compensated by the
force, which is responsible for localizing the matter on the brane. Hence, in the following
subsection we will be interested in the force along the r-direction.

A brane-observer, carrying a static point source, would measure (in the respective asymptotic regimes) a force as sketched in Figure 2.11
We see that the following picture emerges: Let us assume that we are an observer,
who can be approximated by a static point source with mass m, living on ‚Äùour‚Äù brane at
y = 0. Now consider there is a different static point source with mass M located at the
parallel brane at the location y = R and ~r = 0. We start on our brane at ~r = 0 and probe
10

Of course, strictly speaking in our present construction the branes are boundaries and hence do not
respond to dynamics. However, we can switch gears and consider a situation, where the mechanism, which
localizes a point mass on the brane dominates over the mechanism, which fixes the branes to particular
spacetime points.

the gravitational force along the spatial dimensions of our world. If we start increasing
the world-volume-distance r, we would measure a linearly increasing force, which would

be suppressed by O Rr (with respect to regime (II)) as long as we stay within the region
r  R. However, if we would measure again at R  r  œÅ, we would determine the
m
constant force Fr = ‚àí GM
. Finally, for r  œÅ, we would measure the same (or rather
2œÅ2
GM m
1/2) 4-d force Fr = ‚àí 2r2 , as if the 2nd point source was located on our brane and there
were no extra dimensions. Note that in all of those regimes the force behaves differently
than a usual 5-d force would, which would be due to a source on the parallel brane in the
absence of the localized kinetic term (DGP-term).
Now, it is interesting that in this scenario a (spatially) constant attractive force emerges
beyond some length scale R. Let us entertain the possibility for a moment that this force
could compensate the decreasing force (as we increase r) coming from the baryonic matter
on our brane (in our present scenario this baryonic matter would constitute a galaxy,
centered around ~r = 0). Then, one might hope that such a scenario could explain the fact
that the gravitational force being exerted from, say, the interior of our galaxy, is stronger
than the baryonic mass distribution would imply (see e.g. Ref. [17]) without the need of
postulating the presence of dark matter on our brane.
In the regime R  r  œÅ the mass M of the source on the 2nd brane has to be
much larger than the enclosed baryonic matter on our brane in order to compete with the
baryonic Newton‚Äôs force. So one is forced to take
 2
œÅ
M ‚àº MB (r‚àó )
 MB (r‚àó ),
(3.18)
r‚àó
where MB (r‚àó ) denotes the enclosed baryonic mass at the radius r‚àó , at which the baryonic
Newton‚Äôs force starts to decrease. One also has to assume r‚àó ‚àº R, so that the constant force
does not spoil the observations, which are compatible with the usual baryonic Newton‚Äôs
force for r . r‚àó .
In this scenario, the constant force would dominate at ‚àö
the outer galactic region and the
‚àö
rotation-velocities of orbiting objects would go like v(r) ‚àù GM
r. Although this behavior
œÅ
is not observed in more massive galaxies, where the rotation-curves tend to become flat,
in low surface brightness galaxies the circular velocities at large radii are observed to go as
‚àö
‚àù r [18] or even ‚àù r [19].
Note that for the validity of the above outlined scenario we have to check, if the
Newton‚Äôs force between the baryonic matter on our brane and the observer would not be
modified by the parallel brane in a severe way. For this, we can again approximate the
baryonic matter as a point mass and calculate the potential energy, as given in (5.1), where
r is the distance between the point sources. The integral one has to evaluate for this, is
even more involved than the one we considered previously. Hence the analysis is carried
out numerically and displayed in appendix A.2. We see (from Figure 9) that the Newton‚Äôs
force is unchanged for r  œÅ (regimes (II) and (III)). For œÅ  r  rc , the force crosses
over to the same Newton‚Äôs force, but with one half its value. This is due to the fact that
in this regime the observer is at such a large distance that the two branes appear to lie
on top of each other and hence rc ‚Üí 2rc . Since after r‚àó the Newton‚Äôs force falls off, the

Figure 3: This log-log plot shows the force along the brane as a function of r (in units of R). The
m
‚Äùdark‚Äù force (due to a point source with mass M on the parallel brane), expressed in units of GM
2R2
(which is just f from (A.1)), is plotted as the green solid curve. The green dashed curves are its
asymptotes in regimes (III) and (II), given by rrc and r1c . The red curve is the ‚Äùbaryonic‚Äù force
(due to a point source on the same brane), expressed in the same units. The ‚Äùbaryonic‚Äù force is
‚àÇ
obtained numerically from (A.3), with FB = ‚àí ‚àÇr
VB (see also footnote 18). We did not plot the
2
asymptote ‚àº 1/r , because in the regime r  œÅ it is indistinguishable from FB . The point mass,
which gives rise to FB , is chosen such that both forces are of the same order at r = R. We chose
the ratio rc /R = 106 .

proposed scenario remains valid. Figure 3 summarizes the above statement by comparing
the ‚Äùbaryonic‚Äù force to the ‚Äùdark‚Äù force (which is due to the point source on the parallel
brane). We see that in this scenario, for r  R (the interior of our galaxy), the usual
baryonic force is much larger than the dark force. However, for r & R, the constant dark
force takes over.
It should be emphasized that the above distance independent force was derived for
a point source at the 2nd brane. So it could be interesting to take an extended source
and investigate how the asymptotic rotation-velocities would be impacted. It has been
pointed out [20] that there is a substantial diversity in the rotation curves in low surface
brightness galaxies. This diversity might be explained by varying mass distributions on
the parallel brane. Since in the present scenario only the parallel brane would contain this
‚Äùdark‚Äù matter distribution, it does not have to be weakly interacting, but could even form
a highly localized density distribution.
Let us estimate, very crudely, the values of the involved length scales, such that the
above outlined scenario can be valid. If we wish the distance independent force to be
operational at r & 1 kpc, we should choose R ‚àº 1 kpc. If we then want this regime to hold
up to at least r & 102 kpc, we should take
œÅ & 102 kpc,

(3.19)

because for r & œÅ the potential drops and the rotation-velocity would start to decrease.

‚Äì 11 ‚Äì

Since there is the constraint rc & H0‚àí1 ‚àº 106 kpc from cosmological observations [21],12 we
actually need œÅ & 103 kpc, which is significantly larger than the size of the galaxy. This
constraint, however, does not necessarily imply that the constant force should extend to
galaxy cluster scales, because our analysis shows that the constant force gets corrections as
r approaches œÅ. For example, from Figure 3, we see that the force starts to deviate from its
constant behavior for r & 102 kpc, if we take œÅ = 103 kpc. A more detailed investigation is
needed in order to establish the exact behavior of this new force at those large scales and
to compare the results to predictions made by the usual cold dark matter scenario and to
observations. We will postpone such an investigation to a future work.
Let us finally note that if the above scenario is valid, we have to ask the question, why
is the mass on the parallel brane so tightly related to the mass in the ‚Äùbaryonic‚Äù galaxy,
as seen from (3.18). This question should then be addressed in the investigation of galaxy
formation.

Kaluza-Klein decomposition

The Green‚Äôs function and the resulting potential energy can be derived in the KaluzaKlein language. The advantage of this calculation is that we can gain more insight into
the system and compare the results in both languages.

We observe that the wave profiles quickly tend to zero, except for distinct ‚Äùpeaks‚Äù (of

modes eventually survive and contribute to the resulting potential.
Another interesting observation is that the even wave profile always contributes positively (and hence to the attractive gravitational potential), while the odd wave profile
always contributes negatively (and hence adds a repulsive part to the gravitational potential).
Now we want to see how these wave profiles conspire together, so that the potential
turns out the same way as in the 5-d description. Unfortunately, in the KK-picture, it is
very difficult to approximate the integral (4.9) in all, but the case (I).

Hence, the leading contribution to the potential comes from Jeven and we recover the same
result (for the leading order) as in the 5-d description.
Now, let us go to case (II). In Jeven the tangent is still sub-dominant. However, in Jodd
the story changes. Now x‚àó  rrc and hence for x ‚àº x‚àó the terms in the square-bracket
cancel each other and the integrand has a finite contribution in that integration interval.
We were not able to approximate the result analytically, but numerical calculations show
r
that in the leading approximation (where we take e‚àí rc x ‚àº
= 1) Jodd goes to the same value
as Jeven . So, up to (at least) 2nd order the respective first peaks (see Figure 4) cancel each
other and the resulting potential energy vanishes.
If we examine (4.12a) and (4.12b) more closely (taking into account the Yukawasuppression factor), we find that the first peak of Jeven and Jodd , respectively, together
contribute the same leading factor œÅ1 , which we found in the 5-d calculation. We can
interpret this result as if those modes, which contribute to the repulsive potential (belonging
to the first odd peak), counteract the modes, which contribute to the attractive potential
(belonging to the first even peak), and thus weaken gravity.
In case (III) the square-brackets in the denominators go to zero many times, so many
of the peaks contribute to the result. A numerical analysis again shows that we recover
the leading behavior of (3.13).

Consistency with black hole physics and interpretation in terms of
species

In this last section we want to use our findings to discuss some implications for the present
system, coming from the consistency with BH physics. Although the existence of BH‚Äôs
(and their exact form) in the DGP setup has not yet been conclusively established,16 the
following discussion will be based on the assumption that for distances r  rc there should
exist BH‚Äôs in the DGP model, which have the same properties as the usual 4-d BH‚Äôs in
GR.
6.1

Classically static configuration

In Ref. [9] several scenarios (in the context of the ADD model) have been investigated,
where a BH seemingly could not evaporate into the species localized on one or more branes,
because its size was smaller than the distance to those branes. It has been found that all
of those scenarios corresponded to time-dependent configurations. It was shown that a
(classically) static configuration was only reached, after the BH has accreted all the branes
(or had evaporated altogether) and henceforth could evaporate into all species. This was
interpreted as a ‚Äùdemocratic transition‚Äù from a ‚ÄùNon-Einsteinian‚Äù BH (meaning that it
is not the usual time-independent, universally evaporating BH derived from GR) to a
time-independent, semi-classical BH.
Now we want to apply this investigation to our setting. Let us consider a BH localized
on ‚Äùour‚Äù brane, in the presence of a parallel brane that has some species localized on it,
which are not localized on our brane. In the situations of Ref. [9], the tension of the branes
was the key property in deriving the gravitational interaction between the branes and the
BH, and discovering the ‚Äùaccretion‚Äù mechanism.
However, in our scenario the branes are tensionless, so one might naively suspect that
they would not interact with a BH on our brane. But we found in Section 3 that the branes
in our scenario, due to their DGP-term, would react to a present mass-source, such as a
BH, by repelling it. So unless we treat the branes as fixed boundaries, our configuration
would be again time-dependent. It goes beyond the scope of this paper to investigate, if
16

For some discussions see Ref. [24, 25].

‚Äì 16 ‚Äì

a static configuration can be reached and to determine the time scale. However, the fact
that the 2nd brane does not influence us, if it is very far away (see Section 5), suggests
that there is at least the trivial static configuration, namely with the 2nd brane sent to
infinity. In this case there could be a situation, where a BH on our brane cannot evaporate
into the species on the parallel brane.
This result differs from the result in the ADD case and it seemingly tells us that in
the DGP scenario a BH that does not evaporate universally into all species does not have
the tendency to ‚Äùdemocratize‚Äù its evaporation.
However, it is subtle to adopt such an interpretation. For the authors of Ref. [9]
to interpret the evolution towards time-independence (the accretion of the branes) as the
evolution towards democratization, driven by the presence of the localized species on the
distant branes, it was crucial to note the following relation: Since in a general coordinate
invariant setup the branes have a dynamical origin (they are domain walls, instead of being
merely boundary conditions), they must have a tension, which then will excite particles
(even without additionally localized bulk fields). So an attraction between a BH and the
branes is always accompanied by the presence of localized species on the latter. In our
setup, however, the branes were originally introduced as boundary conditions and hence
they can be tensionless.
So our result either illustrates that in the DGP braneworld an interpretation in terms
of species has its limits. Or the species picture tells us that our construction of two distant
DGP branes is not consistent. For example, it might be the case that it is not possible to
localize different species on the two branes in such a way.
6.2

The dependence of the crossover scale on the number of species

As explained in the introduction, in theories, which tend to GR in the infrared, consistency
with BH physics requires a bound on the gravity cut-off. This bound depends on the
number of species in the theory.17 Now, in our scenario the situation is somewhat different.
We consider a model, which goes to GR at short distances, but not at large distances.
However, it is possible to derive a similar bound in our case, if one assumes the existence
of the usual black holes. Furthermore, assuming the equality of the gravity cutoffs for a
5-d and a 4-d observer leads to an interesting relation between the crossover scale and the
number of species. In the following, we will reproduce the derivation, given in Ref. [28].

where Œõ is the cutoff of classical gravity and N is the number of localized species on the

A similar relation as (1.2) can also be derived using the perturbative argument that the graviton
propagator will get radiative corrections from the N fields [26, 27]. However, we want to emphasize that
the perturbative argument is in fact a naturalness argument, since the radiative corrections could cancel
each other, whereas the non-perturbative (BH) argument leads to a consistency limit.

Although in principle this gravity cutoff could be independent of the gravity cutoff for
the 5-d bulk observer (who only sees one species), the authors in Ref. [28] explore the

and hence, from this point of view, is responsible for the strength of gravity on the brane.
On the other hand, we saw in our discussion in the previous section that if the second
brane is far enough away, then no matter how strong gravity is on that brane, it will not
affect the gravitational laws in our world. So the above assumption of the equality of 5-d
and 4-d gravity cutoffs leads to an interesting observation: even if there is a very high
number of species in the theory (but localized on a different brane), it does not alter the
gravity cutoff in our universe. This is again an implication, which differs from the situation
in models, where there is a normalizable zero-mode of the graviton.

Summary

We have investigated the modification of the original DGP-setup [2] by the addition of
a second 3-brane with a localized curvature term, parallel to the brane, where our SM
fields are localized. We have shown that the potential energy between two static point
masses shows similar properties as in the original DGP-setup, but it also acquires a qualitatively different behavior. By calculating the potential energy between two point masses
on different branes, in the regime, where the cross-over scale rc is much bigger than the
4-dimensional distance r and the brane separation R, we found that a new length scale
‚àö
emerges, namely œÅ = rc R. For œÅ  r, the (leading contribution of the) potential energy
‚àö
goes like 1/r, while for r  œÅ it goes like 1/ R. So we found that in the presence of the
branes, 5-d gravity is screened. Although a screening was already found in Ref. [5] for one
brane, we established that the addition of the 2nd brane weakens gravity even further, so
it behaves weaker (for r  œÅ) than 4-dimensional.
Taking into account higher order contributions to the potential, we found a linear rdependence in the regime R  r  œÅ. Hence, if we consider the force along the 3-brane,
there is a spatially constant attractive force between the point masses. This constant force,
coming from matter sources on the parallel brane, can lead to rotation-velocities of objects,
orbiting e.g. the center of our galaxy, which don‚Äôt decrease, but rather slightly increase.
This might be phenomenologically interesting for low surface brightness galaxies. Here, it
might be worthwhile to consider extended sources on both branes and to investigate, in

‚Äì 18 ‚Äì

a future work, how the potential energy behaves and hence what rotation curves can be
derived.
We derived the potential energy in two different ways: we calculated it in 5 dimensions and derived an expression in terms of KK-modes after performing the dimensional
reduction. In the KK-picture we showed that the even modes contribute only to the attractive potential, while the odd modes contribute only to the repulsive part, thus weakening
gravity.
Finally, we have considered the limiting case, where the 2nd brane is sent far away
(R  rc ). In this case, the laws of gravity on our brane behave like in the original
DGP-scenario and are not influenced by the presence of another brane. If one assumes
the existence of BH‚Äôs at distances r  rc and adopts a species-viewpoint, this result is
interesting for the following reasons. A BH on our brane will just evaporate into species
localized on our brane. The strength of the gravitational potential and the gravity cut-off
in our universe are not altered by the (possibly large) number of species on the distant
brane. This suggests that either the usual bound on the number of species has limited
applicability for a DGP-type model or that the species-viewpoint points to an inconsistency
in our assumed construction of two DGP branes.
To gain more insight, one might investigate in a future work, how a classically static
configuration (where the 2nd brane is at a finite distance) might look like in the presence of
the branes and their repulsive nature. Would the BH also try to accrete the other brane?

Numerical demonstration of the validity of integral approximations
Point sources on different branes

In order to show that the leading order approximations, which we found for the three
specified regimes in Section 3, are correct, we compare the numerical value of J (obtained
by numerical integration of (3.6)), as a function of r, to the two asymptotes JDGP (from
(3.11)), valid for r  œÅ, and ‚àöœÄ2 œÅr , valid for r  œÅ. Since J can be viewed as a function of
the dimensionless variables r/R and rc /R, all functions, plotted in Figure 5, depend just
on r and rc , expressed in units of R. We see that J is approximated excellently by the
given leading order approximations for the two regimes r  œÅ and r  œÅ. Furthermore, if
the ratio rRc is large enough, J can be approximated by a constant for œÅ  r  rc .
Next, let us verify that also the corrections to the leading order terms of J, given in
Section 3, are accurate. Since in Section 3 we are interested mostly in the force along
the brane, where the terms linear in r will drop out, in the remainder of this subsection,
we will perform our numerical analysis exclusively for the force (3.17). In order to plot a
dimensionless quantity f , we define the physical force as

two different colors depending on the value of rc /R. We see that J is approximated very well by the
two asymptotes in the two regimes, separated by œÅ (we have plotted the asymptotes with an offset,
because otherwise the curves would lie on top of each other). The vertical lines show the scales,
which separate the regimes, stated in Section 3. We observe that J does not change its leading
order behavior by crossing r ' R. At r ' œÅ, J crosses over from a linear behavior to the ‚ÄùDGP
behavior‚Äù, where J is approximately constant for r  rc and then crosses over to a 1/r-behavior
for r  rc . The constant part is more pronounced for larger ratios rc /R.

We again consider f as a function of r and rc (in units of R). Figure 6 shows the force
along the brane between two point sources on different branes. We see that the leading
order terms of (3.17) approximate the actual behavior of the force very accurately in the
regimes (I)-(III), given in Section 3.
To justify the corrections to the leading order terms in the expression (3.17), let us
consider regimes (I) and (II) separately. For R  r  œÅ, we compare the numerical value
of f , where we subtracted the leading order term rRc , to the correction terms given in (3.17)
(the numerical prefactors are specified in the caption of Figure 7), in Figure 7.
We see that the two given corrections in (3.17) are in
‚àö good agreement with the numer2 2 r
1 R
ical result, where œÄr2 rc dominates for smaller r, while 3 œÅ3 dominates for larger r, in the
regime (II).
Next, we compare the corrections for œÅ  r, given in (3.17), to the numerical value
2
of f , where we subtracted the leading order term Rr2 . We show in Figure 8 that the two
corrections, given in (3.17), are again quite good approximations for the numerical result,
18

In order to extract a numerical result, we pull the derivative inside the integral of (3.6) and integrate
numerically.

already for rc /R = 106 , the regime (II), where the force can be approximated as constant, extends
over almost two orders of magnitude. Increasing rc /R, extends this region. For r  R, the force
vanishes linearly, while for r  œÅ, it interpolates between a 1/r2 - and a 1/r3 -behavior.

The plot in Figure 9 shows the numerical result for (A.4) for two different values of rRc .
We see that for r  œÅ, JB = œÄ, so we recover the usual Newton‚Äôs potential. In particular,
there is no change of behavior in going from r . R to r & R. Only when r approaches œÅ
does the potential energy crosses over to the DGP-behavior, found in Ref. [2]. So if rc /R is
large enough, there will still be a region, where the potential is approximately Newtonian,
but with half its value (see footnote 7). One of the results of the present work is that we
found the length scale, which differentiates between these two behaviors, to be œÅ.

that JB starts with a constant value of œÄ for r  œÅ, does not change across R and then crosses over
to a DGP-behavior at r ‚àº œÅ, where it goes from a constant value of œÄ/2 to a 1r -behavior. Again,
the constant region (œÄ/2) is more pronounced for larger values of rc /R. The vertical lines show the
scales, which separate the regimes, stated in Section 3.

In principle, every choice of Cm and Dm parametrizes a different solution in the 2-dimensional
