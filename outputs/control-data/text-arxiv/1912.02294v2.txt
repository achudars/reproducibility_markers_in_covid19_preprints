Abstract
We present a model with S3 ⊗ Z2 model plus a sterile neutrino and its phenomenological expectations for the production of charged scalars at the Compact Linear Collider. At tree level, our
model predicts a total cross section in between 0.1 and 10−5 pb for the e− e+ → H + H − process,
considering all possible mass values for the charged scalar in the CLIC experiment. We also show
that this prediction holds regardless of the masses of the other exotic particles and their couplings.

INTRODUCTION

The Standard Model (SM) of fundamental interactions is still an incomplete theory, even
though it was shown as an experimentally proven theory with a high predictive power, once
we have observed dark matter (DM) from galaxy rotation curves, and there is no viable
candidate for DM in the SM as it is today, the SM has an unknown missing piece. We
also have the fact that neutrinos in the SM are non-massive, therefore, to have massive
neutrinos, the only requirement is the addition of right handed (or sterile neutrino) fields to
the SM matter content. However, because neutrinos are only charged under weak isopsin
and hyperchagre, some consequences arise because of the introduction of their right - handed
components, for example, neutrinos can be a majorana particles. This means that neutrinos
are the most elusive of the known particles. Their weak interactions make it very difficult to
study their properties, but, this may be seen as a good quality for the neutrinos, once they
can hold the key to solve several mysteries in particle physics and cosmology. For instance,
the simplest dark matter candidate, at least from the point of view of particle physics, is
the neutrino.
The DM particle candidates may have very different masses (for reviews of DM candidates
see e.g. [1–4]): massive gravitons with mass ∼ 10−19 eV [5], axions with mass ∼ 10−6 eV
[6], sterile neutrinos having mass in the keV range [7], sypersymmetric (SUSY) particles
(gravitinos [8], neutralinos [9], axinos [10] with their masses ranging from eV to hundreds
GeV, supersymmetric Q-balls [11], WIMPZILLAs with the mass ∼ 1013 GeV [12, 13], and
many others). Thus, the mass of DM particles becomes an important characteristic which
may help to distinguish between various DM candidates and, more importantly, may help
to differentiate among different models beyond the SM.
Sterile neutrinos as Dark Matter candidates, with the mass in the keV range, were originally suggested in [7]. Because these particles are neutral with respect to all SM charges,
they have to be massive and, while unstable, they can have a lifetime longer than the age
of the Universe (controlled by the active-sterile mixing parameter). If they exist, they were
produced at high temperatures in the early Universe. The sterile neutrinos are never in
thermal equilibrium, unlike other cosmic relic particles (e.g. photons, neutrinos or hypothetical WIMPs) because of their feeble interaction, so their exact production mechanism is
model-dependent. In Ref.[14] they discuss the most important observational constraints on

2

these particles as DM candidates.
Despite being a candidate for DM known for more than 15 years [7], recently the sterile
neutrinos once again stood out as it was shown in Ref.[15]. If three sterile right-handed
neutrinos are added to the SM, it is possible to explain simultaneously the data on neutrino
oscillations (see e.g. [16–18] for a review) and the Dark Matter in the Universe, without
introducing any new physics above electro-weak scale. Moreover, if the masses of two of these
particles are between ∼ 100 MeV and the electro-weak scale, and are almost degenerate, it is
also possible to generate the correct baryon asymmetry of the Universe (see e.g. [15, 19, 20]).
The third (lightest) sterile neutrino can have a mass in the keV-MeV range and be coupled
to the rest of the matter weakly enough to provide a viable (cold or warm) DM candidate.
In this context, we have proposed an extension of the model with a S3 ⊗ Z2 symmetry
[21, 22] assuming that right-handed neutrinos can be sterile. The model consists of two
scalar doublets and two scalar singlets plus the SM particles, with their potential having
the most general lagrangian allowed by the chosen symmetry. We present a full analysis of
the scalar potential of the model, showing the scalar mass eigenstates, and identify the SM
Higgs boson among these by imposing that its Yukawa couplings are the same in our model
and in the SM.
Models with a S3 symmetry have been studied in a variety of previous works. Among
these, some are: the model’s scalar potential, including its mass eigenstates and selfcouplings [23–25], the quark sector of these models [26], and the neutrino masses and their
mixing [27]. Despite some of these topics overlapping our work, we feel that what we present
here is relevant. In our model two scalar singlets are added, which further increases the
scalar sector and its complexity, leading to different mass eigenstates and Yukawa sectors.
Therefore, our results are not the same as the ones shown in the works just cited.
Also, the extension of the scalar sector brings new charged scalars, which in turn provide
new sources of CP violation, given that they come up in vertices with the form f¯L fR H ± ,
where fL,R denotes left and right-handed fermions. While in the SM we have vertices with
the form f¯L fL W ± that give rise to the CKM matrix, the f¯L fR H ± vertices mixes left and
right-handed fermions, bringing in new combinations of matrices that diagonalize the fermion
mass eigenstates. These new combinations of unitary matrices generate new sources of CP
violation, which are necessary to solve other problems faced by the SM such as the observed
matter–antimatter asymmetry of the Universe [28–30] and mass differences in mesonic sys3

tems [31, 32].
In order to explore the properties and phenomenological consequences of both type of
particles from our model, charged scalars and sterile neutrinos, we are going to study the
tree level process e− e+ → H + H − , where the sterile neutrinos participate as virtual particles
and the charged scalars as final state particles. Because we are studying electron-positron
collisions, we considered the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC), a multi TeV linear electronpositron collider under development [33, 34], to calculate the cross section for the e− e+ →
H + H − process.
CLIC is a TeV-scale high-luminosity linear e+ e− collider under development by international collaborations hosted by CERN. For an optimal exploitation of its physics potential
it is foreseen to be built and operated in stages at center-of-mass energies of 380 GeV, 1.5
TeV and 3 TeV, for a site length ranging between 11 km and 50 km. The high collision
energy combined with the large luminosity and clean environment of the e+ e− collisions
will enable to measure the properties of SM particles, such as the Higgs boson and the top
quark, with unparalleled precision. CLIC might also discover indirect effects of very heavy
new physics by probing the parameters of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory with
an unprecedented level of precision. This includes new particles detected in non-standard
signatures, such as electrically charged scalars. The construction of the first CLIC energy
stage could start as early as 2026 and the first beams would be available by 2035, marking
the beginning of a physics programme spanning 25 − 30 years and providing excellent sensitivity to Beyond Standard Model physics, through direct searches and via a broad set of
precision measurements of SM processes, particularly in the Higgs and top-quark sectors.
The outline of the paper is as follows: first we present the model and its Lagrangian, then
we focus into its scalar sector calculating the mass eigenstates and indentify the SM Higgs
boson within those, and finally calculate the cross-section for the e− e+ → H + H − process in
our model, followed by our conclusions.

THE S3 ⊗ Z2 MODEL PLUS A STERILE NEUTRINO

Here we will use the S3 discrete symmetry in order to obtain a model with 3 Higgs
doublets, being two of them inert. The S3 symmetry consists of all permutations among
three objects. However, the representation of order 3 is reducible and is decomposed in two

being 1 and 10 singlets and 20 a doublet. Besides we have that 1⊗1 = 1 and 10 ⊗10 = 1. For
more details about this and other discrete symmetries see Ref. [35]. The ZN group, that is

where i, j = e, µ, τ and d = 1, 2. In Eq. 2 L is the SM lepton doublet, l is the SM charged

is an energy scale above the electroweak scale for the dimension 5 operator. For more details
about the model see [22], the difference in our work is that we changed the interactions of
Ns to make it lighter than the other right-handed neutrinos.
The scalar SU(2) doublets, D1,2 and S, are introduced to generate Majorana masses for
the left-handed neutrinos, according to the scotogenic model. These doublets may also be
candidates for dark matter, a possibility that was studied in [22]. In order to have a lighter
neutrino than the scale of the heavier Majorana neutrinos we use the S3 symmetry, that
5

separates the right-hand neutrinos into a doublet and singlet (this lighter neutrino may fit
the evidences of lighter sterile neutrinos). However, for the symmetry to be conserved it is
necessary to introduce two scalar singlets (ζ1,2 ), so that the heavier right-handed neutrinos
have Majorana masses on the TeV scale.

where
V (2) = µ2SM S † S + µ2d (D1† D1 + D2† D2 ) + µ2ζ (ζ12 + ζ22 ) + µ212 ζ1 ζ2 ,

+(D1† D1 − D2† D2 )(ζ12 − ζ22 ) + H.c.] + b4 [(D1† D2 − D2† D1 )(ζ1 ζ2 − ζ1 ζ2 )]
V (4c) = c1 (ζ12 + ζ22 )2 + c2 [(ζ1 ζ2 + ζ2 ζ1 )2 + (ζ12 − ζ22 )2 ],
6

where we have used [ζd ζd ]20 = (ζ1 ζ2 +ζ2 ζ1 , ζ1 ζ1 −ζ2 ζ2 ). Here, we will consider all the couplings
to be real parameters i.e., there is no CP violation in the scalar sector. The S3 symmetry
forbids linear terms with the doublets D1 , D2 in the scalar potential and also some of the
Yukawa interactions with charged leptons. This ensures the inert character of the these
doublets after the S3 symmetry is introduced. Notice that, although the term µ212 breaks
softly the S3 symmetry, it happens in the sector of the singlets ζ1,2 and does not spoil the
inert character of the doublets.
From Eq. (4), we obtain the following stability conditions for the potential (i.e., setting
its derivatives to zero):

MASS MATRICES AND EIGENSTATES

The potential in Eq. 4 gives us four mass matrices: one for the charged scalars, one for
the CP-odd neutral scalars and two for the CP-even neutral scalars. In the sections below
we show these matrices and their corresponding eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Also, when
we have ± or ∓, the upper sign corresponds to the vacuum stability criteria from Eq. 8 and
the lower sign to Eq. 9.

where, when we have ± or ∓, the upper sign corresponds to the vacuum stability criteria

follow Ref. [36], where we impose that the Yukawa couplings of the Higgs boson are the

From Eq. 20, Re[S 0 ] is the only one that gives mass to the known fermions, therefore we
will identify it as the SM Higgs. The matrix in Eq. 19 can be diagonalized by an orthogonal

THE e− e+ → H + H − PROCESS AT CLIC

The lowest order contributions to the e− e+ → H + H − process in our model are given by
the diagrams in Fig. 1. For the scalar mass eigenstates we considered solution 10 from the
appendix A 2. The model has two charged scalars, H1± and H2± . In here we assumed that
H1± is the lightest one, and that is the one considered in our cross sections. Taking these
assumptions into account, the relevant vertices for our calculations are:
√ c2 − s2W
H + H − Z → − πα W

where α is the fine structure constant, vSM is the SM vacuum expectation value for the Higgs
field, me is the electron mass, and cW and sW are the cosine and sine of the electroweak
ν
angle, respectively. F1S
and Λ are parameters of the Yukawa sector of our model (Eq. 2),

and v1 and a5 are parameters of the scalar sector of our model.

FIG. 1: Lowest order contributions to the e− e+ → H + H − process.
To calculate the cross sections we considered the three energy stages that CLIC will run
at: 380 GeV, 1.5 TeV and 3 TeV (see Table II). Throughout this section we will consider
ν
X ≡ v1 F1s
/Λ = 0.1 or 0.01 (these values for X allow perturbative calculations). Also, we

will consider a5 = 1 for the coupling constant in the HH1+ H1− vertex, the highest possible
value that allows perturbative calculations.

In Fig. 2 are presented the e+ e− → H1+ H1− cross section predictions for

GeV. The top left graph shows that the contribution of the sterile neutrino to the cross
section is constant in the range mN = [1, 1000] eV, therefore we set mN = 1 eV in the
other plots, which is compatible with the current experimental data [37]. In the top right
graph the partial contributions show the hierarchy of the contributors: the photon is the
main responsible, it is followed by the sterile neutrino with mN = 1 eV and X = 0.1, the
third place is due to the Z gauge boson; then the signal of the neutrino with X = 0.01
is suppressed, and the most marginal participation comes from the Higgs boson. At the
bottom we show the total cross section, taking into account all diagrams from Fig. 1. One
12

can notice that for 0 GeV < mH1 < 130 GeV the total cross section stays in the interval
σ =[1 pb, 0.005 pb].

The top left graph shows that the contribution of the sterile neutrino to the cross section

Fig. 2, this time however, the cross sections are about two orders of magnitude smaller than
before. At the bottom we show the total cross section, taking into account all diagrams
from Fig. 1. One can notice that for 0 GeV< mH1 < 700 GeV the total cross section stays
in the interval σ =[0.01 pb, 0.0001 pb], once again about two orders of magnitude smaller
√
than in the s = 380 GeV case.

In Fig. 4 are presented the e+ e− → H1+ H1− cross section predictions for

√
s = 3 TeV.

Just like in the previous cases, the top left graph shows that the contribution of the sterile
neutrino to the cross section is constant in the range mN = [1, 1000] eV. In the top right
graph the partial contributions follow the same hierarchy from Figs. 2 and 3, where the
√
cross sections are about one order of magnitude smaller than the s = 1.5 TeV case. At
the bottom we show the total cross section, taking into account all diagrams from Fig. 1.
One can notice that for 0 GeV < mH1 < 1400 GeV the total cross section stays roughly in
√
the interval σ =[0.01 pb, 5 × 10−5 pb], about one order of magnitude below than the s =
1.5 TeV case.
Overall, we can expect a cross section for the e+ e− → H1+ H1− process roughly in between
√
0.1 pb and 5×10−5 pb (depending on s and on mH1 ). This is true even if we set X = a5 = 0,
decoupling the sterile neutrino and the Higgs boson from the charged scalars, given that the

contributions from the photon and Z boson are predominant in this case. Other Standard
Model extensions with charged scalars are likely to give similar results if H + H − Z and
H + H − γ vertices are present. Also, had we considered other solutions for the scalar mass
eigenstates, it would only change the e± N H ± and HH + H − vertices, introducing mixing
angles that are likely to reduce these vertices. Therefore, changes in these vertices would give
negligible differences in our total cross section prediction given that the main contribution
comes from the photon, which has its vertex unchanged from choosing other solutions for
the scalar mass eigenstates.
Considering the integrated luminosities shown in Table II, for

√

s =380 GeV, where the

cross section ranges in between 1 pb and 0.005 pb, the first stage of CLIC should give us a
number of events in between 106 and 5 × 103 . Meanwhile, for stage 2, with our cross section
predictions ranging from 0.01 pb up to 0.0001 pb, the number of events should be between
15

2.5 × 104 and 250. Finally, for

√
s = 3 TeV, where we predict σ =[0.01 pb, 5 × 10−5 pb], the

number of events should be between 5 × 104 and 50.

A.

The H1± decay

At first, one would expect to detect these exotic charged scalars through their decay
products, which would leave their signals in the detector. The main decay for H1+ is H1+ →
eN , which leads to ee → eeN N in an electron-positron collider, where the main background
for this process in the SM comes from ee → eēνe ν e .
At a glance, one would expect the H1+ → eN H and H1+ → W + H decays as well (where
H is the SM higgs boson), however, there are no vertices involving H1± and H, which forbids
these processes. This can also be seen from Table I, the exotic particles are charged under
the S3 and Z2 symmetries, while the SM particles aren’t, therefore forbidding these decays.
In the SM σ(ee → eēνe ν e )SM = 4.41 × 10−1 , 5.00 × 10−1 , 1 pb for the center of mass
√
energies s = 380, 1500, 3000 GeV, while in our S3 model σ(ee → eeN N )S3 ∼ 10−24 ,
√
∼ 10−27 , ∼ 10−28 pb for the respective s = 380, 1500, 3000 GeV, considering mN = 1 eV,
ν
mH1+ = 1 GeV and X1 = ν1 F1,s
/Λ = 0.1. Also, the larger mH1+ , the smaller the cross section,

making the contribution of the H1± scalar even smaller for values above 1 GeV. Therefore,
the H1± decay should cause a very small change to the measured σ(ee → eēνe ν e ) cross section
(given that the neutrinos are accounted as missing energy), making them undetectable in
this channel [38, 39].

From the lifetimes shown in Fig. 5, we expect the charged scalar to travel in between
2 × 10−12 s · c up to 7 × 10−10 s · c, equivalent to 0.6 mm up to 21 cm. Therefore, given that
the H1+ → eN signal would be overwhelmed by the ee → eēνe ν e process, and the possibility
of a measurable track in the detector (since the H1± is electrically charged), we expect these
exotic scalars to be detected directly from their tracks in the detector, instead of being
detected through their decay products. The innermost tracker layer is at 165mm from the
center [40], in this case the travel time must be at least 5.504 × 10−10 s, which corresponds
to a mass of roughly 1 TeV according to Fig. 5.

CONCLUSIONS

We have calculated the cross-section at tree-level for the production of charged scalars in
eletron-positron collisions in the S3 ⊗ Z2 model. For our numerical results we considered the
Compact Linear Collider energies and luminosities, so we could have a realistic view of possible experimental results. We have also shown the scalar mass eigenstates and interactions,
necessary to our calculations.
Out of the exotic particles involved in the diagrams for the cross-section, the sterile
neutrino gives a constant contribution to the final result, regardless of its mass. Its coupling
ν
constant (X = F1S
v1 /Λ) to the charged fermions and scalars does have an influence on the

17

final results, but still is a small contribution when compared to the one given by the diagram
with the photon. However, a parameter that noticeably changes the cross-section values is
the charged scalar mass, leading to a difference of orders of magnitude when comparing
the lowest and highest possible cross-section values. In the end, the expected number of
events depend heavily on the charged scalar mass, ranging from 106 all the way down to
250. Therefore, this mass value can make the difference in between an observable and a
non-observable production of these exotic particles. On top of that, given the small cross
section of H1+ → ec NS , the fact that its signal would be overwhelmed by the SM background
from the ee → eēνe ν e process, and the possibility of the charged scalar leaving measurable
tracks in the detector, we expect this particle to be detected directly in case it exists and is
heavy enough (i.e. survives long enough) to reach the innermost tracker.

Appendix A: Diagonalization solutions for the 3 × 3 CP-even mass matrix

In this appendix we show all the solutions for the 3 × 3 CP-even mass matrix discussed
in Sec. V, except the ones where v1 = v2 = 0. In the first subsection we consider the
vacuum stability condition from Eq. 8, and in the second the condition from Eq. 9. All
solutions are presented in the same format: first we show the relations that the parameters
must obey, then the diagonalized matrix with the masses squared, and finally the orthogonal
diagonalization matrix.
