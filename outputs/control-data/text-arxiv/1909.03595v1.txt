ABSTRACT
The Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) has extensively monitored the August
2019 outburst of the 401 Hz millisecond X-ray pulsar SAX J1808.4–3658. In this Letter, we report
on the detection of a bright helium-fueled Type I X-ray burst. With a bolometric peak flux of (2.3 ±
0.1) × 10−7 erg s−1 cm−2 , this was the brightest X-ray burst among all bursting sources observed
with NICER to date. The burst shows a remarkable two-stage evolution in flux, emission lines at
1.0 keV and 6.7 keV, and burst oscillations at the known pulsar spin frequency, with ≈ 4% fractional
sinusoidal amplitude. We interpret the burst flux evolution as the detection of the local Eddington
limits associated with the hydrogen and helium layers of the neutron star envelope. The emission lines
are likely associated with Fe, due to reprocessing of the burst emission in the accretion disk.

1. INTRODUCTION

The proto-typical accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar
(AMXP) SAX J1808.4–3658 (hereafter SAX J1808), was
first discovered through the detection of a thermonuclear (Type I) X-ray burst with the BeppoSAX satellite
in September 1996 (in ’t Zand et al. 1998). With Xray outbursts recurring every 2 − 4 years, this source
has been extensively monitored ever since, leading to
the first detection of accretion-powered millisecond pulsations (Wijnands & van der Klis 1998), and the confirmation that X-ray burst oscillations correspond with
the stellar spin frequency (Chakrabarty et al. 2003).
In each of the eight outbursts from SAX J1808 that occurred between 1996 and 2015, at least one X-ray burst
has been detected (in’t Zand et al. 2001; Bult & van
der Klis 2015; Patruno et al. 2017; Sanna et al. 2017).
The majority of these bursts showed burst oscillations

Einstein Fellow

(Bilous & Watts 2018) and were observed near peak luminosity of their respective outbursts, when the accretion rate was ≈ (3−5)×10−10 M yr−1 (Bult & van der
Klis 2015). Detailed modelling of a well sampled burst
train observed with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer
(RXTE ) in October 2002 (Galloway & Cumming 2006)
demonstrated that these events are examples of X-ray
bursts in the “delayed helium” regime (Narayan & Heyl
2003; Galloway et al. 2017). In brief, these bursts are
due to a thermonuclear flash in a nearly pure helium
layer of the neutron star envelope. This layer of helium
builds up on a timescale of one to a few days, through
a stable β-limited CNO cycle at the base of a hydrogen
layer. The hydrogen layer, in turn, is replenished by the
continuous accretion of gas supplied by a hydrogen-rich
brown dwarf companion star, which resides in a 2.01
hour orbit around the pulsar (Chakrabarty & Morgan
1998; Bildsten & Chakrabarty 2001).
The X-ray bursts of SAX J1808 have also reliably
shown photospheric radius expansion (PRE; see, e.g.,

2
Galloway et al. 2008, for a review). Such PRE may
drive the ejection of burning ashes, whose presence could
cause discrete spectral features in the burst emission
(Weinberg et al. 2006; Yu & Weinberg 2018). Measuring
such spectral lines gives a window into the thermonuclear burning reactions, and can potentially be used to
constrain the neutron star compactness. Additionally,
a large fraction of the burst emission is expected to be
intercepted and reprocessed by the accretion disk (Ballantyne & Everett 2005; Degenaar et al. 2018; Fragile
et al. 2018), providing an opportunity to characterize
the state of the accretion disk through the spectrum of
the reflected burst emission.
Launched in June 2017, the Neutron Star Interior
Composition Explorer (NICER; Gendreau & Arzoumanian 2017) combines good spectral resolution with
superb time-resolution and high throughput in the
0.2 − 12 keV energy band.
These properties make
NICER an ideal instrument to study the evolution of
PRE in Type I X-ray bursts (see, e.g., Keek et al.
2018a,b; Jaisawal et al. 2019), and search for discrete
spectral features (Strohmayer et al. 2019). Hence, when
SAX J1808 began a new outburst in August 2019 (Russell et al. 2019; Goodwin et al. 2019b; Parikh & Wijnands 2019; Bult et al. 2019), we triggered an extensive
NICER monitoring campaign. During this campaign we
detected two X-ray bursts; the first occurred on August
9 and was relatively faint, the second was seen on August 21 and was much brighter. In this Letter we report
on the unusual properties of the August 21 X-ray burst.
The detailed analysis of the earlier burst and the full
NICER campaign will be presented elsewhere.

2. OBSERVATIONS

On 2019 August 21 at 02:04 UTC, NICER observed a
bright X-ray burst from SAX J1808. These data are
available under the NICER ObsID 2584010501. We
processed the data using nicerdas v6a, which is packaged with heasoft v6.26. We applied standard screening criteria, keeping only those time intervals when the
pointing offset was < 5400 , the Earth limb elevation angle was > 15◦ , the elevation angle with respect to the
bright Earth limb was > 30◦ , and the instrument was
outside of the geographic region of the South Atlantic
Anomaly. Additionally, standard background screening criteria were applied, which reject all epochs where
the rate of saturating particle events (overshoots) is
greater than 1 ct s−1 detector−1 , or greater than 1.52 *

cor sax−0.633 , where cor sax1 gives the cut-off rigidity of the Earth’s magnetic field, in units of GeV c−1 . We
then applied the barycorr tool to correct the observed
event times to the Solar System barycenter, where we
used the JPL DE405 planetary ephemeris (Standish
1998) and the optical coordinates of Hartman et al.
(2008). Finally, we estimated the background contributions to our data from NICER observations of the
RXTE blank-field regions (Jahoda et al. 2006).
3. ANALYSIS AND RESULTS

The X-ray burst onset, t0 , occurred on MJD
58716.089362 TDB, which was 442 s into a 1063 s continuous exposure. In the following we focus our analysis
on this exposure and express all times with respect to
the noted onset time.
3.1. Light curve and phenomenology
At t0 the 0.3 − 10 keV count-rate increased rapidly
from an averaged 125 ct s−1 to ≈ 34, 000 ct s−1 over a
timespan of ≈ 4.3 s. The peak rate was maintained for
≈ 3.6 s, before the burst began to decay. The subsequent
decay progressed on a minute-long time scale: at t ' 64 s
the burst rate had dropped to below 5% of the peak rate,
and by the end of the available exposure, at t = 621 s,
the source flux had fallen to 172 ct s−1 . While this rate
was slightly higher than the averaged preburst rate, the
preburst light curve showed a modest upward trend. If
we fit this trend with a linear function, then we find that
the burst rate decayed to the extrapolated intensity at
t ' 580 s.
Two unusual features stand out in the burst light
curve (Figure 1). First, it shows a pronounced double peaked structure, with a local minimum of ≈
15, 000 ct s−1 at t ' 13.1 s and a secondary peak of
≈ 16, 500 ct s−1 at t ' 15.5 s. While double-peaked Xray bursts have commonly been observed, these structures are usually caused by PRE: the temperature of
the photosphere temporarily shifts out of the instrument
passband, causing an apparent dip in the observed Xray rate (Grindlay et al. 1980). Given its low-energy
coverage, NICER is able to follow the temperature of
the photosphere throughout the PRE phase, so any observed dip in the light curve is likely due to a dip in
bolometric flux (Keek et al. 2018a; Jaisawal et al. 2019).
We investigate this in Section 3.4.
Second, there is a noticeable pause during the rise
to the first peak. Initially the flux increases rapidly;

where the tbabs interstellar absorption model (Wilms
et al. 2000) was used with the photoelectric crosssections of Verner et al. (1996), diskbb (Makishima
et al. 1986) is a multi-color disk blackbody component,
and nthcomp (Zdziarski et al. 1996; Życki et al. 1999)
is a thermal Comptonization component. We used an
absorption column density of NH = 2.1 × 1021 cm−2
(Papitto et al. 2009; Di Salvo et al. 2019), and electron
temperature of 30 keV (Di Salvo et al. 2019). We further tied the nthcomp photon seed temperature to the
disk temperature. Our best-fit had a reduced χ2 (χ2r )
of 1.04 for 375 degrees of freedom (dof), yielding an
inner disk temperature of kT = 0.70 ± 0.07 keV and
a power-law photon index of Γ = 2.0 ± 0.4. Using the
cflux model we further measured the unabsorbed 1−10
keV flux to be (2.85 ± 0.05) × 10−10 erg s−1 cm−2 , from
which we extrapolate a bolometric flux (0.01 − 100 keV)
of (4.7 ± 0.5) × 10−10 erg s−1 cm−2 . Assuming a distance
of 3.5 kpc (Galloway & Cumming 2006), a 1.4 M neutron star mass, and a 10 km radius, this corresponds to a
mass accretion rate of Ṁ = 2.9 × 10−11 M yr−1 , which
is ≈ 0.3% of the Eddington rate.

Vertical gray lines were added to guide the eye.

however, between t ' 0.6 s and t ' 1.3 s, this rise
briefly stalls, with the count-rate remaining constant at
≈ 13, 600 ct s−1 . After this pause, the rate continues to
increase toward the maximum, albeit at a slightly slower
pace (Figure 1, inset of top panel). Simultaneously, the
hardness ratio (the 3 − 10 keV rate over the 0.3 − 1 keV
rate) evolves dramatically. As the count-rate begins to
rise, the hardness ratio spikes. Subsequently, the hardness briefly dips, and then stabilizes. It is during the dip
that the pause in count-rate is observed. Additionally,
the previously mentioned dip in count-rate (at t ' 13 s),
coincides with a similar dip in the hardness ratio, suggesting these two features are related.
3.2. Pre-burst emission

We investigated the spectral shape of the burst emission by extracting a spectrum from a 4 s interval at the
peak of the burst (Figure 2). We first attempted to
model this spectrum by adding a blackbody component
to the preburst spectrum model, holding all parameters
except for those of the blackbody constant. At a χ2r of
28 for 631 dof, this model failed to account for a large
excess below 1.5 keV and above 5 keV.
In an attempt to account for the residuals we applied a
free scaling factor to the components describing the preburst spectrum (Worpel et al. 2013), so that our model
was
tbabs(bbodyrad + f(diskbb + nthcomp)),
where bbodyrad is a blackbody component with its normalization proportional to surface area. At a χ2r of 5.4
for 630 dof, this model failed to remove the large residuals. Additionally, at f = 159, the magnitude of the obtained scaling factor is not realistic, as it is much larger
than the f ∼ 2 − 10 that is typically observed (Worpel
et al. 2013).
In an alternative approach to account for the large
soft excess, we adopted a model consisting of the

4
inclination to 65◦ , which is within the range allowed by
modelling of the Fe K line in the persistent emission of
SAX J1808 (Cackett et al. 2009; Papitto et al. 2009;
Di Salvo et al. 2019). We further note that while this
inclination is inconsistent with the ≤ 30◦ limit derived
by Galloway & Cumming (2006), a more sophisticated
◦
analysis of the same burst data yield 69+4
−2 (Goodwin
et al. 2019a). With these parameters held constant, we
obtained a line normalization of 0.62±0.16 ph cm−2 s−1 .
Meanwhile, the 1 keV Gaussian line had a normalization
of 0.27 ± 0.07 ph cm−2 s−1 and standard deviation of
0.05+0.07
−0.02 keV.
In an attempt to apply a physical foundation to our
modelling of these data, we also fit the spectrum using
the reflection models of Ballantyne (2004). This overall
model is summarized as

fixed preburst model plus two blackbody components.
This model provided a much better description of the
data (χ2r of 1.11 for 628), yielding a blackbody with
0.233 ± 0.003 keV and 318 ± 5 km for the soft excess, and
1.83 ± 0.03 keV and 14.7 ± 0.3 km for the higher energy
emission (presumably the photosphere). Some structure still remained in the residuals, most prominently at
1.0 keV and 6.5 keV. The fit was significantly improved
(χ2r of 1.07 for 624 dof) by adding a diskline component (Fabian et al. 1989) at 6.7+0.1
−0.3 keV, along with a
Gaussian line at 1.05 ± 0.02 keV. The signal strength
of the diskline was insufficient to reliably constrain
the disk radius and inclination, giving respective limits of < 13 rg and > 65◦ . Instead, we fixed the inner radius to 11 rg , which is the approximate magnetospheric radius (Bult & van der Klis 2015), and the

where rdblur is a convolution component that applies
the relativistic effects associated with an accretion disk
around a compact object, and the reflection component tabulates reflection spectra calculated for a hydrogen density of nH = 1018 cm−3 , using a grid in temperature (kT ), ionization (log ξ), and Fe abundance (log Fe).
As before, we kept the parameters for the absorption
column and preburst components fixed. The temperature parameter of the reflection table was linked to
the blackbody temperature, and the rdblur parameters were identical to those of the diskline component
discussed above. This model yielded a reasonable description of the continuum (χ2r of 1.2 for 628 dof), but
left a large residual at 1 keV. Adding in a Gaussian component gave a good fit to the data at a χ2r of 0.95 for 633
dof, with a normalization of 0.86±0.15 ph cm−2 s−1 and
standard deviation 0.09±0.02 keV. The best-fit parameters for the reflection component were log ξ = 3.79+0.11

flection flux of (1.87 ± 0.13) × 10−7 erg s−1 cm−2 , indicating the reflection fraction is Frefl /Fbb ≈ 2.3. Finally,
we note that in this model, the photosphere blackbody
had a temperature of 2.05 ± 0.06 keV and a radius of
6.6 ± 0.7 km. While the temperature is consistent with
the double blackbody model, the radius is significantly
smaller.
The double blackbody and reflection models both provide a statistically acceptable description of the spectrum, and give a roughly equivalent interpretation.
Since the double blackbody model is phenomenologically
simpler, it can be fit robustly to much shorter integration times, yielding a higher time resolution view of the

spectral evolution in the burst. In the following we will
therefore focus our analysis on this model.
We extracted spectra from three other distinct time
intervals during the burst: the pause (0.6 s), the dip
(0.7 s), and the second peak (2 s). Each spectrum could
be described with the double blackbody spectrum plus
6.7 keV diskline component. The second peak additionally required an emission line at 1 keV. These spectra are shown in Figure 2 and their best-fit parameters
are listed in Table 1.

Reduced χ2

To investigate the full spectral evolution of the Xray burst, we applied high-resolution time-resolved spectroscopy. We extracted 133 spectra from dynamically allocated intervals. Each interval was constructed to have
at least 0.125 s of exposure, and was increased as needed
to include a minimum of 2000 counts. Each spectrum
was then fit using the double blackbody model. For
simplicity we did not include emission line components,
giving in slightly poorer fit statistics. The resulting evolution in spectral parameters is shown in Figure 3.
The time resolved spectroscopy demonstrates that the
hot (≈ 2 keV) blackbody in our model can be understood as the emission from a neutron star photosphere
that undergoes PRE between t ' 1 s and t ' 13 s. The
radius expansion is moderate, reaching a maximum radius of ≈ 15 km. The cool (≈ 0.2 keV) blackbody, on the
other hand, maintains a stable temperature through the
burst, with its emitting area closely tracking the evolution of the overall flux. This trend further supports the
idea that the soft excess tracks an interaction between
the burst emission and the neutron star environment,
such as the disk reflection model discussed in Section
3.3.
Considering the bolometric flux, we see that the
burst emission reaches a stable peak of (2.40 ± 0.12) ×
10−7 erg s−1 cm−2 when the photosphere is at its largest
extent. As the photosphere begins to contract, the flux
begins to decrease. This cooling trend, however, is interrupted at t ' 15.5. In the following ≈ 3 s, we see the
bolometric flux holding constant, causing an excess over
the cooling trend that coincides exactly with the second peak observed in the light curve. Hence, the spectroscopy confirms that the dip and second peak seen in
the light curve are indeed astrophysical in origin rather
than a passband effect.
Finally, we note a peculiar feature in the spectroscopic
results: the temperature evolution of the photosphere
shows two peaks, marking the start and end of the PRE
phase. These start and end times coincide with the
pause and the dip, respectively. Furthermore, both the

Fractional Amplitude

To search for burst oscillations, we constructed a
1/8192 s time-resolution light curve in the 0.3 − 10 keV
energy band. We then searched for coherent oscillations in a 10 Hz region centered on the known 401 Hz
pulsar spin frequency by applying a sliding window
search method (see, e.g., Bilous & Watts 2018, and
references therein). Specifically, we used window sizes
of T = 1, 2, and 4 s, with strides of T /10 s. For each
window position, we computed a power spectrum and
searched for a signal power in excess of the expected
noise distribution (van der Klis 1989). We detected a
significant oscillation (> 3σ) in all windows between
t = 17.7 s and t = 24.6 s. The fractional sinusoidal amplitude2 of the burst oscillation was (4.0 ± 0.6)%, while
the oscillation frequency was 401 Hz and did not show
any significant drift.
Given the stability of the burst oscillation frequency,
we folded the event times within the noted epoch on the
pulsar spin period to obtain a waveform for the burst
oscillation. For comparison, we also extracted the waveform of the persistent pulsations from the full ObsID,
excluding the burst emission (see Bult et al. 2019 for
a preliminary ephemeris). Both waveforms are shown
in Figure 4. The burst oscillation has a similar profile
and amplitude as the persistent pulsation, but appears
to lead the pulse by 34◦ ± 7◦ .
To resolve the burst oscillation with respect to photon
energy, we applied a sliding window to the instrument

oscillation amplitude and phase. We then repeated this
method for the non-burst data. The resulting amplitude
spectra are shown in Figure 5. Although the averaged
profiles are similar, the energy dependence of the burst
oscillation is very different from that of the pulsar. Particularly notable is that the burst oscillation amplitude
is mostly constant below ≈ 5 keV, but rises sharply at
6 − 7 keV.

from IGR J17062–6143 (Degenaar et al. 2013; Keek et al.
2017), which were associated with ionized Fe L and Fe K
emission lines. Thus, the detection of these lines provides strong evidence that we are seeing the burst emission reflected from the accretion disk. Applying a physically motivated disk reflection model to our data (Section 3.3) indicates that such a reflection component provides a satisfactory description of the soft excess, but
cannot fully account for the emission feature observed
at 1 keV. We suggest that this may be due to the presence of additional elements not currently incorporated in
these models (e.g. Ne). Additionally, this model fit indicated a strong reflection signal, which may indicate that
the accretion disk structure is significantly impacted by
the burst (He & Keek 2016; Fragile et al. 2018).

Figure 5. Top: energy dependence of the burst oscillation
waveform. Bottom: same for the persistent pulsation observed outside the X-ray burst interval. Note that these data
were computed using a sliding window, so adjacent points
are correlated. Additionally, in order to look for decohering
noise, we plot the waveform phase even if the amplitude is
not formally significant. See text for further details.

We detected a bright X-ray burst from SAX J1808
with NICER. The burst showed a peculiar light curve,
with a notable pause during the rise and a double-peaked
structure. Additionally, we detected significant burst
oscillations in the cooling tail of the burst and emission
features in the burst spectrum. We now discuss each of
these findings.
4.1. Reflection
We find that the burst spectrum shows a strong excess at the lowest energies that requires the inclusion
of a second blackbody in the spectral model. A similar
strong soft excess was previously observed in SAX J1808
by in ’t Zand et al. (2013). In contrast to that work,
however, we also observe emission features at 1 keV
and 6.7 keV. A similar complex of emission features

The X-ray burst light curve shows a double-peaked
structure. Given that the second peak in count-rate occurs after the PRE phase, and that this peak is reproduced (albeit less prominently) in the bolometric flux,
we conclude that this feature is astrophysical in origin.
A very similar double-peaked structure in an X-ray burst
from 4U 1608–52 was recently observed with NICER
(Jaisawal et al. 2019). Although that burst showed a
hotter photosphere and lacked the strong soft excess
that we detect in SAX J1808, the rebrightening phase
is nearly identical in both bursts. In each case, the end
of the PRE phase coincides with a pronounced dip in
count-rate, and is followed by a secondary peak.
Jaisawal et al. (2019) considered a number of plausible
origins for the rebrightening of the burst flux, including the ignition of fresh material (Keek & Heger 2017),
stalled thermonuclear flame spreading (Bhattacharyya
& Strohmayer 2006), and waiting points in the rpprocess (Fisker et al. 2004). Our observation of rebrightening in the X-ray burst from SAX J1808 does not rule
out any of these proposed explanations. It does, however, add two new perspectives: first, in SAX J1808
the rebrightening coincides with the onset of burst oscillations, which may be difficult to reconcile a flame
spreading model. Second, in SAX J1808 the dip appears
related to the pause during the rise. If this relation is
real, then whatever physical mechanism underpins these
features may also be related to the rebrightening.
4.3. Burst Oscillations
We found that the X-ray burst shows burst oscillations at the expected 401 Hz spin frequency. Comparing these oscillations with the accretion-powered pulsations, we find that the two waveforms are remarkably

8
similar, but the burst oscillations lead the pulsations by
34◦ ± 7◦ . Similar results were reported from RXTE observations of burst oscillations in SAX J1808 observed
during the cooling phase of an X-ray burst (Chakrabarty
et al. 2003). The fact that the burst oscillations are so
closely matched to the persistent pulsations in terms of
their waveform, suggests that both must arise from geometrically similar, if not the same, confined emitting region (hot-spot) on the stellar surface. With this in mind,
it is interesting to note that the NICER data indicate the
waveform energy dependence of the burst oscillations is
quite different from that of the persistent pulsations.
Some of the difference may simply arise from the strong
reflection component, which is likely not pulsed, and
thus is expected to dilute the measured burst oscillation
amplitude at low energies. A detailed spectral-timing
analysis may be able to determine how much each of
the spectral components is oscillating. Such an analysis, however, is beyond the scope of this initial work.
4.4. Eddington limits
Finally, we note that our analysis of the light curve,
the spectral evolution, and the timing behavior all indicate that each time interval where the NICER countrate of SAX J1808 is between 13,000 ct s−1 and 14,000
ct s−1 is somehow special. At these count rates, the
burst rise pauses, the dip reaches its minimum, and
burst oscillations appear. The bolometric flux measured
at these times was (1.43 ± 0.09) × 10−7 erg s−1 cm−2 ,
which corresponds to a luminosity of (2.08 ± 0.13) ×
1038 erg s−1 . We note that this luminosity is consistent
with the expected local Eddington limit of a hydrogen
envelope of a neutron star (Lewin et al. 1993).
For spherically symmetric emission, the Eddington luminosity as measured by the observer is predicted as
(Lewin et al. 1993; Suleimanov et al. 2017)
Ledd =

4πGM c 1
,
κT (1 + z)

(1)

where M is the neutron star mass, G the gravitational constant, c the speed of light, and z the gravitational redshift. Finally, κT = 0.2(1 + X) cm2 g−1 is
the Thomson electron scattering opacity, with X the
hydrogen abundance in the atmospheric layer. Hence,
we expect that the flux level at which PRE occurs differs depending on the material composition of the neutron star envelope. For a hydrogen layer with cosmic
abundances (X = 0.73), the predicted luminosity is
≈ 2.0 × 1038 erg s−1 , whereas the luminosity of a pure
helium layer (X = 0) is larger by a factor of 1.73. In

SAX J1808, the ratio in bolometric flux between the
peak and pause/dip is 1.68 ± 0.13.
The following scenario now emerges for the X-ray
burst evolution. As the critical ignition point is reached
in the helium layer, the flame front quickly spreads
across the stellar surface and an intense radiation field
starts to diffuse outward. After about 0.5 s, the radiation pressure reaches the local Eddington limit of the
hydrogen layer, causing that layer to expand. Meanwhile, the intensity of the radiation field continues to
increase, either expelling or diluting the hydrogen layer,
so that the observed spectrum becomes dominated the
PRE of the helium layer. Over the following 10 s, we
observe the full helium PRE cycle, causing the photosphere to cool and then heat, as the envelope expands
and then contracts. Once the envelope touches back
down on the stellar surface, the burst flux is still comparable to hydrogen Eddington limit, although at the time
this touchdown occurs, there will likely have been some
mixing of the atmospheric layers. Subsequently, the
photosphere cools, while the radius grows, and then, after about 4 − 5 s, the rebrightening mechanism activates
and quickly thereafter the burst oscillations appear. The
photosphere continues to cool, and after about 10 s both
the rebrightening and oscillations switch off.
The flux levels of the pause and peak are highly suggestive that we are seeing both the hydrogen and helium
Eddington limits in a single X-ray burst. The evolution
of the hardness ratio around the pause further supports
the interpretation that this stall in the rise is related
to the expanding hydrogen layer. The link between
the pause and the dip is weaker, but highly suggestive,
and may yet provide the insight required to uncover the
physics behind intrinsic rebrightening during the tail of
an X-ray burst.
