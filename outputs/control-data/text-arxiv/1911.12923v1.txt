Abstract
Sand electrification is important for aeolian sediment transportation on terrestrial bodies with silicate sand as the main sediment composition. However,
it has not been thoroughly studied for icy bodies such as Titan with organic
sand as the main dune-forming material. We used the colloidal probe atomic
force microscopy (AFM) technique to study triboelectric charging processes
using Titan and Earth sand analogs. We found that it is easy to generate triboelectric charges between naphthalene (a simple aromatic hydrocarbon), polystyrene (an aromatic hydrocarbon polymer), and borosilicate glass
(Earth silicate sand analog). Strong electrostatic forces can be measured after contact and/or tribocharging. In contrast, tholin, a complex organic
material, does not generate any detectable electrostatic forces with contact
or tribocharging within the detection limit of the instrument. If Titan sand
behaves more like tholin, this indicates that the tribocharging capacity of
Titan sand is much weaker than Earth silicate sand and much less than
previously measured by Méndez-Harper et al., (2017), where only simple organics were used for Titan sand analogs. Thus, triboelectrification may not
contribute to increasing interparticle forces between sand particles on Titan
as much as on Earth. Interparticle forces generated by other electrostatic
processes or other interparticle forces such as van der Waals and capillary
cohesion forces could be the dominant interparticle forces that govern Titan
sand formation and sediment transportation on the surface. Titan sand is
also unlikely to produce large electrical discharge through tribocharging to
affect future missions to Titan’s surface.

1. Introduction
Aeolian landforms have been observed on various planetary bodies with
solid surfaces, despite the diverse environmental conditions such as surface
temperature (from <40 K for outer solar system bodies such as Pluto and
Triton to ∼740 K for Venus) and surface atmospheric pressure (from <10−5
bar to ∼90 bar) on these bodies. Other than environmental conditions, the
transporting materials on these bodies are different as well. For the inner
solar system bodies, Venus, Mars, and Earth, the main transporting materials
are silicate sand (Greeley & Iversen, 1985), while it is mainly ices or organics
transporting on the surfaces of outer solar system objects including Titan
(Lorenz et al., 2006), Pluto (Telfer et al., 2018), and Triton (Smith et al.,
1989).
On Titan, the dune particles are interpreted to be made of mainly organics or organic coated ices (e.g., McCord et al., 2006; Soderblom et al., 2007;
Clark et al., 2010). There are several possible candidates that could make up
Titan’s sand particles (see e.g., Barnes et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2018), including complex tholin-like organics, evaporites (dissolved part of the complex
organics in Titan’s liquid hydrocarbon lakes and seas), and water ice that
makes up the bulk of Titan’s crust.
One of the important parameters required to characterize aeolian sand
transportation is the threshold wind speed, the minimum wind speed needed
to saltate sand particles. The threshold wind speed can be derived by a force
balance between gravity, wind drag and lift forces, and the interparticle forces

(Shao & Lu, 2000). Gravity, wind drag and lift forces are mostly affected
by the environmental conditions such as gravity and atmospheric density
(they are also affected by particle density, see Yu et al., 2017a), while the
interparticle forces are not only affected by environmental conditions, but
also intrinsic material properties such as surface energy, surface chemistry
and functional groups, surface roughness, etc. Yu et al., (2017b) has recently
measured the surface energy of one possible Titan sand analog, ”tholin”, to
be around 70 mN/m.
The interparticle forces for wind-blown sand generally include van der
Waals forces, capillary forces due to condensed liquid, and electrostatic forces.
Yu et al. (2017b) used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to directly measure
the interparticle cohesion between Titan aerosol analog tholin particles, and
they found that the van der Waals cohesion between tholin particles is larger
than between silicate sand and analog materials used in the Titan Wind
Tunnel (TWT), where experiments are conducted in ambient air. The above
experiments mainly focused on measuring interparticle forces including van
der Waals forces and capillary forces (when exposed in humid air), while
the contributions from the electrostatic forces are small. In large-scale aeolian dune settings, the saltating grains are constantly colliding and rubbing
together, which could induce electrostatic forces by contact charging and
friction induced tribocharging.
Contact charging, or contact electrification, is the electrical charge that
developed between two materials (identical or different) during their contact
and separation. Tribocharging also includes rubbing (friction) of the two
materials during contact, thus increasing the applied force and frictional energy, and generally produces higher charge density. Both charging processes
depend on the physical and chemical properties of the charging materials,
environmental conditions (e.g., pressure, temperature and relative humidity
(RH)), and the nature of the contact between the surfaces of the charging materials such as contacting geometry and surface roughness (Lacks &
Mohan-Sankaran, 2011).
Electrostatic forces act over a much longer range compared to van der
Waals forces, and thus could affect both the initiation of sediment entrainment (e.g., the threshold wind speed) and particle trajectories after the sediments are lifted off the surface. Furthermore, charged particles injected high
in the air could form strong electric fields with the particles near the surface
or the surface itself, and would further alter the trajectories and charging
properties of the saltating particles (Schmidt et al., 1998; Zheng et al., 2003;
3

Kok and Renno, 2008). Chemistry (tribochemistry) could also be driven by
the charging processes, where the mechanical energy could be turned into
chemical energy during a local discharge, and could alter the chemical properties of the charged grains (Thomas and Beauchamp, 2014; Wu et al., 2018).
Sand electrification has proven to be an important process for terrestrial
wind-blown sand transport. Electric fields and charges on sand grains have
been characterized both in the field (e.g., Schmidt et al., 1998; Zhang et
al., 2004) and in wind tunnel simulation experiments (e.g., Greeley & Leach,
1978, Zheng et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2004). The near surface electric fields
can be up to tens to hundreds kV/m in a saltating sand cloud, pointing
upward, which indicates a negatively charged surface and positively charged
particles (Zheng et al., 2013). It is consistent with particle charge distributions measured in the wind tunnel experiments, where larger particles and
the surface tend to charge positively, and smaller particles tend to charge
negatively. Sand and dust electrification may also be important for aeolian
transport and geologic features on Mars (Krauss et al., 2003; Anderson et
al., 2009) and regolith levitation on the Moon (Singer & Walker, 1962; Sickafoose et al., 2001). The materials tested in the above studies were mainly
terrestrial silicate sand (Earth quartz sand, lunar or Mars regolith simulants),
while sand electrification studies that include analog materials for icy bodies
are necessary to fully understand aeolian processes in the outer solar system
such as Titan.
Méndez-Harper et al. (2017) measured electrification of some organic
molecules as Titan sand analogs by using a tumbler to charge the grains
and then measure the charge distribution of the particles using a Faraday
cage. They found that the organic molecules that they investigated have
higher maximum charge densities in a dry atmosphere (RH<1%) than silicate sands in a humid atmosphere (30%<RH<40%). However, the above
experiments used only simple organics and polymers (naphthalene, biphenyl,
and polystyrene) as Titan sand analogs. An experiment that uses the Titan aerosol analogs, tholin, which could be the precursor of Titan sand by
coagulating into bigger sand-size grains (e.g., Yu et al., 2017b), is needed to
fully characterize the whole spectrum of the charging abilities of Titan sand
candidates.
The difficulty with using tholin is that this material is usually produced
in low yields (e.g., He et al., 2017), prohibiting its use in bulk studies. In this
study we used a novel colloidal probe AFM technique to directly charge and
measure electrostatic forces between single particles so that we can accom4

modate the small material volume of tholin. This technique has been used
to measure the cohesion forces between tholin particles and tholin-coated
borosilicate glass beads (Yu et al., 2017b). In this study, in order to reduce the effect of local surface roughness and geometry, we used smooth
spheres (both bare or coated with other materials) and flat smooth surfaces
for our measurements. All the measurements were done under dry conditions (RH<1%). Controlling the contacting geometry and environmental
conditions can reduce contribution from these factors in electrification, while
enhancing the differences from the physical and chemical nature of the materials themselves. The tumbler experiment (Méndez-Harper et al., 2017)
involves a large number of variables by using materials of various geometries and surface roughness, and charging the terrestrial and Titan analog
materials under different humidity conditions, which could complicate the
interpretation of results on the intrinsic charging capacity of different materials.
Furthermore, with the precise control of both the lateral and vertical
movements of the AFM, we can accurately characterize the process of contact charging and tribocharging individually, while the tumbler experiment
(Méndez-Harper et al., 2017) could involve electrification by multiple processes, not only contact charging and tribocharging, but also fragmentation
charging (exchange of bits of charged materials between contact surfaces).
Performing the experiments on single particle scale could also ensure that
charging occurs only between the same material of the interest, while eliminating the effect of charging between dissimilar materials.
A more detailed description of the technique and our experimental setup
can be found in sections 2.1 and 2.2. In section 3.1, we test the technique
using two materials (mica and silicate glass) that are known to charge each
other (e.g., McGuiggan, 2008). In section 3.1–3.3, we present the triboelectrification results for borosilicate glass, a simple aromatic hydrocarbon
naphthalene, an aromatic hydrocarbon polymer polystyrene, and a complex
organic material called tholin, respectively. We discuss the possible charging
mechanisms for the tested materials in section 4.1, and the implications of
our results on aeolian transport and lightnings on Titan in sections 4.2 and
4.3.

2. Methods
2.1. AFM Colloidal Tip and Surface Preparation
Tholin was produced using the Planetary HAZE Research (PHAZER)
experimental system at Johns Hopkins University, with a 5% CH4 /N2 cold
gas mixture (around 100 K) in a glow plasma discharge chamber (see He et
al., 2017). Tholin was deposited homogeneously on the acid-washed microspheres, colloidal AFM probes (AFM cantilevers with a 20 µm diameter glass
sphere attached to the end of the cantilever), and on mica discs (10 mm diameter). The coated tholin film is very smooth (RMS roughness is ∼1 nm for
1µm×1µm scan, measured by AFM) and has a thickness of approximately
1.3 µm.
Two sources of glass spheres were used: soda lime glass microspheres of
diameter 50–100 µm (Polysciences, Inc.) and sQube (Nanoandmore) 20 µm
diameter borosilicate glass spheres. The 50–100 µm spheres were supplied
in powder form and needed to be attached to the AFM cantilever. To do
this, the microspheres were twice washed with a dilute HCL solution (∼1.05
M/L) and then rinsed with HPLC-grade water eight times in an ultrasonic
cleaner (Lab Safety Supply). They were then dried in a 65 ◦ C oven (Lab
Safety Supply Model No.32EZ28) overnight. After coating with tholin, a
single microsphere was then attached to the AFM cantilever using the AFM
motors to position the sphere at the end of the cantilever and epoxy resin to
glue the sphere to the end of the cantilever. The resulting colloidal probe was
left to sit overnight in ambient air (McGuiggan et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2017b)
to allow epoxy to dry. The sQube colloidal probe AFM cantilevers with a 20
µm diameter glass sphere attached were also purchased. These cantilevers
were directly coated with tholin. This procedure allowed a shorter exposure
of tholin to ambient air. We use spheres of diameter between 20-100 µm,
because the AFM cantilevers we used has a limited spring constant of around
40 N/m, and larger spheres could break the cantilever easily due to gravity.
We made the glass and the polystyrene colloidal AFM probes by gluing a bare acid-washed glass sphere and a polystyrene sphere (diameter
range: 85-105 µm, Cospheric, Santa Barbara, CA) to AFM cantilevers. To
make naphthalene-coated colloidal AFM probe, we dip-coated a glass colloidal AFM probe into a naphthalene-acetone solution and then dried for
30 minutes. The naphthalene surface was made by putting a few drops of
naphthalene-acetone solution on a glass slide and then dried for 30 minutes.

2.2. Charging and Electrostatic Force Measurements
We performed all the charging and force measurements using a Bruker
Dimension 3100 atomic force microscope, which has vertical resolution of
0.1 nm. The AFM was enclosed in a controlled RH environment equipped
with a digital hygrometer (Dwyer Instrument, RH range: 0–100% with ±2%
accuracy, temperature range: -30–85 ◦ C with 0.5 ◦ C accuracy). The RH in
the system can vary between <1% in a dry nitrogen environment, to about
40–50% in ambient air. Before each charging experiment, we flowed dry
nitrogen into the AFM system enclosed in a glove bag and kept the RH< 1%
for at least two hours. The spring constants of the AFM cantilevers are
around 40 N/m, and were calibrated by thermal tuning. The sensitivity of
the AFM photodiode was calibrated by indenting a hard silicon surface.
We performed both contact charging and tribocharging between the AFM
colloidal probes and various surfaces. The AFM setup is shown in Figure
1(a). The colloidal particles on the colloidal probes include soda lime glass
spheres (50–100 µm), polystyrene spheres (85–105 µm, Cospheric), tholincoated glass spheres (50–100 µm and 20 µm for colloidal probes from sQube),
and naphthalene-coated glass spheres (50–100 µm). The planar surfaces we
used include cleaved mica sheets, tholin-coated mica sheets, and naphthalenecoated glass slides. All of the charging experiments were conducted with
RH<1% in dry nitrogen to prevent charge leakage through water in the air
and oxygen contamination of the samples. An insulating PET film was placed
beneath the surfaces to make sure that the generated electrostatic charges
are not conducted outside the system. The experiments we conducted are
summarized in Table 1. The charging method was adopted and modified
from Bunker et al., (2007) and is described below.
For contact charging, we used the colloidal probe to repeatedly contact
the substrate in the normal direction by taking multiple force-distance curves
at a rate of 1 Hz without lateral scanning. For tribocharging, the colloidal
probe was scanned over a 10 µm×10 µm area for 256 lines using contact mode
imaging with a scan speed of 3 Hz. Contact mode was used to ensure that
rubbing and friction between the colloidal probe and the surface is occuring
during the imaging. Immediately after the scanning was completed, a series
of force curves were collected between the colloidal probe and the substrate.
An example force curve and the interactions between the colloidal probe
and the surface are shown in Figure 1(b). Because of the dry environment
(RH<1%), no capillary forces should be involved in the jump-in and pull-off
forces. The jump-in forces could include short-range van der Waals forces
7

and long-range electrostatic forces if generated by charging. The pull-off
forces are an indication of the total cohesion (between the same materials)
or adhesion (between two different materials) forces.
We can also vary the scan speed and scanning area to test different tribocharging strengths. The scan speed can be tuned from 0.5 Hz to 10 Hz,
which are equivalent to between 10 µm/s to 200 µm/s. We can also vary
the scanning area from 10 µm×10 µm, to up to 50 µm×50 µm. After the
charging experiments, the colloidal probes were imaged using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to examine the surface conditions and to measure
for exact size of the colloidal spheres.
The minimum charge (Qlim ) detectable by the AFM between two chemically identical particles with radius R1 and R2 can be estimated as follows.
Assuming the net charges generated on each surface is +Q and -Q, the electrostatic interaction forces (FE ) can be written as (Bichoutskaia et al., 2010):
(+Q)(−Q)
− f (k, R1 , R2 , r),
(1)
r2
where K=1/4πε0 ≈ 9×109 V·m/C, r is the distance between the two particles, and k is the dielectric constant of the material. Because the total net
charge of the two surfaces has to be zero, the first term is always negative
(attractive force). The second term describes the polarization effect and is
always attractive (Bichoutskaia et al., 2010). Here we use the first term to
calculate the detection limit, which provides an upper limit of the detectable
minimum charge.
The vertical resolution of the AFM is 0.1 nm, but to confirm that longrange force exists between the surfaces, not fluctuation of the baseline, a
vertical range deviation to the baseline of at least ∼5 nm is needed. We
can assume a typical spring constant of the AFM cantilever to be 40 N/m,
thus the minimum detectable force by the AFM is 80 nN. The electrostatic
interaction typically happens in a distance range between 0.1 nm and 100
nm. Using the first term of Equation 1, the minimum charge detection limit
Qlim is thus 1.3×10−18 to 1.3×10−15 C, which is lower than the detection
limit of common charge amplifiers (e.g., Qlim ≈ 10−14 C, Méndez-Harper et
al., 2017).

3. Results
3.1. Validation of methodology
To test our experimental setup, we performed charging experiments initially between two different materials that are known to charge each other,
fused silica (soda lime glass sphere) and mica (e.g., McGuiggan, 2008) in
a nitrogen environment (RH<1%). We measured the force-distance curves
before charging, after contact charging, and after tribocharging. We selected
the last set of force curves before charging, and the first sets of force curves
right after tribocharging and show them in Figure 2. Before charging, the
jump-in forces are very small, and the pull-off forces are short-range, around
3.8 µN (Figure 2(a)). After contact charging, the jump-in forces remain
small and short-range, which indicates that no long-range electrostatic interaction was generated from contact charging. The force curve immediately
after tribocharging (Figure 2(b)) shows that both the jump-in forces and
pull-off forces become larger and longer-range (both forces act over a range
of 0.8–1 µm). The jump-in forces are two orders of magnitudes larger than
before charging, ∼5.0 µN, and the pull-off forces are about 5 times larger
than before charging, ∼19.6 µN. It seems electrification can greatly enhance
adhesion between materials, which is observed also by Bunker et al., (2007).
Through the long-range jump-in and pull-off forces, we can calculate the
amount of charge generated on the particle. Using the first term of Equation
1, we can estimate the charge amount (Q) of (4.7 ± 1.7)×10−15 C. With SEM
image, we are able to measure the size of the glass sphere and then calculate

9

the charge to mass ratio (Q/m) to be (9.1 ± 3.4)×10−6 C/kg (glass sphere
diameter 73 µm and density of sphere 2500 kg/m3 ).
We also performed charging between two identical glass surfaces (a colloidal glass sphere and a glass surface) that are reported to charge in granular
systems (Forward et al., 2009). As shown in Figure 2(c), both the jump-in
forces and the pull-off forces are short-range before charging. After contact
charging, both the jump-in forces and the pull-off forces become longer in
range and larger in magnitude. The jump-in forces increase from 0.34 µN
to 1.3 µN (4 times increase), and the pull-off forces increase from 5.4 µN
to 8.4 µN (∼1.5 times increase), both forces act over 0.3 µm after contact
charging. The result is similar after tribocharging. We notice that the extent
of charging between chemically identical materials is weaker than between
different types of materials. The increases in both force magnitudes and the
range of forces between glass surfaces are less than between glass-mica surfaces. The calculated charge amount (Q = (8.8 ± 2.8)×10−16 C) and the
charge to mass ratio (Q/m = (9.3 ± 2.9)×10−7 C/kg, glass sphere diameter
90 µm and density of sphere 2500 kg/m3 , see also Figure 5) are also an order
of magnitude smaller between the two glass surfaces compared to between
glass and mica surface. The charge to mass ratio between two glass surfaces
is within the measured charge to mass ratio range of silicate sand measured
by Méndez-Harper et al., (2017).
3.2. Charging between simple organics
We performed charging experiments between the simple PAH naphthalene and the hydrocarbon polymer polystyrene in a dry nitrogen environment
(RH<1%). Naphthalene is a possible constituent of Titan’s atmosphere
(Waite et al., 2007), and both naphthalene and polystyrene were used by
Méndez-Harper et al., (2017) as the Titan sand analog materials. Figure 3
shows the force curves taken between a coated naphthalene microsphere and
a coated naphthalene surface, right before and after contact charging. We
were able to generate strong long-range electrostatic attraction by continuously contacting the two surfaces. As shown by the approach curves, after
charging, the jump-in forces became two times bigger from 0.25 µN to 0.51
µN. The jump-in forces also act for about an order of magnitude longer range
(>0.3 µm) compared to before charging (0.04 µm). Note that the pull-off
forces also become larger (from 0.51 µm to 0.77 µN) and act longer range
(from 0.08 µm to 0.13 µm) than before charging, which suggests electrification also enhances cohesion between materials. The calculated charge amount
10

is (4.1 ± 0.4)×10−16 C and the charge to mass ratio is (1.4 ± 0.1)×10−6 C/kg
for the force curve after contact charging (sphere diameter 60 µm and density of sphere 2500 kg/m3 , Figure 5), which is in within the measured charge
to mass ratio range by Méndez-Harper et al., (2017). Tribocharging also
strongly charged naphthalene and generated longer-range and larger jump-in
and pull-off forces, but the charging extent was similar to contact charging
(not shown in Figure 3).
For polystyrene, to make sure that the charging is performed between
identical materials, we used the polystyrene colloidal sphere to charge another
polystyrene sphere, because we were unable to find a polystyrene flat surface
with identical polymerization as the polystyrene spheres. We found that,
similar to naphthalene, polystyrene spheres charge strongly between each
other after both contact charging and tribocharging. The charge to mass
ratio is calculated to be (4.6 ± 1.5)×10−6 C/kg for polystyrene (polystyrene
sphere diameter 90 µm and density of sphere 1070 kg/m3 , Figure 5), which
is within the range reported by Méndez-Harper et al., (2017).
3.3. Charging between tholin
For the first time, we also performed charging experiments between Titan
aerosol analog, tholin, which is a complex organic made of various chemical
species (Cable et al., 2012). All the charging experiments and measurements
were conducted in a dry nitrogen atmosphere (RH<1%). Figure 4(a) shows
the set of force-distance curves taken between a coated tholin sphere and
a smooth tholin coated surface, right before charging and after tribocharging. As shown in the force curves after charging, no long-range forces were
observed. The jump-in forces are hardly detectable (less than 0.1 µN) both
before charging and after tribocharging. Actually, we were unable to generate
any long-range electrostatic attractive forces between tholin with either contact or tribocharging. Using the detection limit we derived in the methods
section, we calculated the upper limit of the detected charge amount between tholin surfaces to be 1.3×10−18 C. The resulting charge to mass ratio
is 1.9×10−9 C/kg (sphere diameter 80 µm and density of sphere 2500 kg/m3 ,
see Figure 5), which is two to three orders of magnitude smaller than the
charge to mass ratio generated between glass, polystyrene, and naphthalene
surfaces.
Note that in Figure 4(a) the pull-off forces after charging (1.8 µN) are
even smaller in magnitude than before charging (2.8 µN), which is likely
caused by a difference in contact area or surface roughness after rubbing.
11

The stochastic change of the magnitude of the pull-off forces does not directly
relate to whether the long-range electrostatic forces are present or not. As
shown in the SEM image of the tholin-coated colloidal probe after charging
(Figure 4(b)), cracks are generated and the two contact surfaces could have
different contact area before and after charging, leading to different pull-off
forces. Electrostatic forces, however, are long-range in nature. If electrostatic
forces are generated, a deviation of the force from the flat baseline will be
detected as shown in Figure 2 and 3. But this was not detected between
tholin surfaces. For tribocharging, we tried to increase the scan speeds (from
0.5 Hz to 10 Hz) and scan size (from 10 µm×10 µm to 50 µm×50 µm) to
increase the contact area and rubbing frequency between the tholin surfaces,
but we were still not able to generate any long-range electrostatic forces
within the capacity of the instrument.
4. Discussion
4.1. Charging Mechanism
It was previously believed that contact charging and triobocharging only
happened between different materials with distinct work functions (the energy required to remove an electron from the surface), which results in the
“triboelectric series” (Shaw, 1917). However, charging has been observed
between spatially homogenous and chemically identical contacting insulators
(Lowell and Rose-Innes, 1980; Lowell and Truscott, 1986; Komatsu et al.,
2004; Apocada et al., 2010). However, the underlying driving mechanism
for charge transfer between identical insulators is still unknown. Several
proposed mechanisms include asymmetric rubbing (Lowell and Rose-Innes,
1980) and statistical variations in material properties (Apocada et al., 2010).
The proposed transfer species include electrons, ions, and atomic, nanoscale,
or microscale material bits (Lack and Mohan-Sankaran, 2011). However, on
the local scale, it was found that the magnitude of charge on a charged surface
may not be uniformly negative or positive; instead, the surface may consist
of a mosaic of positively and negatively charged domains in nanoscale dimensions (Pollock et al., 1995; Baytekin et al., 2011). They observed that the
charge density on each mosaic is relatively high, while the overall net charge
is much weaker. They attributed the observation to the local chemical and
nanomechanical inhomogeneity at or near the surface of the material (PDMS
was used in the study). Tholin is a material with more complex chemical
nature (it is made of a mixture of chemicals, see e.g., He et al., 2012; He
12

& Smith, 2014; Sebree et al., 2018), thus the mosaic pattern could be more
complex for tholin compared to PDMS, leading to a weaker overall charge on
the surface, because the mosaics cancel out each other. The instrument used
here measured the overall charge between the surfaces rather than the charge
domain distribution over the surfaces. For future studies we will attempt to
measure these possible charge domains to confirm this hypothesis.
Our results suggest that simple organics like naphthalene and polystyrene
and silicates like glass would charge more easily compared to tholin. Naphthalene and polystyrene would charge strongly by contact charging, while
tholin does not charge under even the most violent abrasive rubbing and
contacts that are allowed by our equipment. The electrical resistivity of all
the test materials in this study are listed in Table 1. They are all insulators
and their electrical resistivities are orders of magnitudes larger than conductors (e.g., metals have resistivities of 10−8 Ω · m). So tholin should not
dissipate charges faster than the other materials.
Although it is a powerful method for characterization of nanoscale interactions between single particles, our charging method with the AFM has a
few limitations. First, the charging/rubbing rate (up to several hundred microns per second) is about two orders of magnitude slower than the natural
charging processes in wind-blown sand (around several cm/s). The impact
velocity of Titan sand is the about 0.5 m/s (Kok et al., 2012; J. Kok, personal communication), and the density of the grain is around 500-1400 kg/m3
(Horst & Tolbert, 2013; He et al., 2017). For AFM, the fastest rubbing gives
the grain a rubbing velocity of 1000 µm/s (10 Hz scan rate with a 50 µm scan
size). The size of the grain is also several times smaller than actual grains on
Titan, thus the collisional energy of the AFM is at least 4 to 5 orders of magnitudes smaller than natural environments on Titan. So we are essentially
measuring the lower limit of the triboelectric charges developed on tholin
particles. It is likely that with higher collisional energies they could charge
each other, but their charging capacity is definitely weaker than polystyrene,
naphthalene, and even glass, because those materials already charge strongly
with the low collisional energies that the AFM generated.
Second, even though we can study the interaction between two single
grains, our method misses the multiple particle interactions in granular systems (Kok and Lacks, 2009), for which electrostatic charging is not only
correlated with the bulk chemical properties of the materials, but also particle size distribution (Forward et al., 2009). We use spherical particles with
size between 20 and 100 µm, which are smaller than the estimated optimum
13

size range of sand grains on Titan (100-300 µm, Lorenz et al., 2006). But the
sphere to flat charging system can simulate a small grain charging a bigger
grain (flat surface corresponds to a grain of infinite radius) in a granular flow
system. Additionally, other materials with similar grain sizes tribocharge
easily (naphthalene, polystyrene, and glass), while tholin does not. This indicates that as a material, tholin has weaker tribocharging capacity compared
to common polymers, simple organics, and Earth silicate sand.
Third, the AFM can only characterize the magnitude of the net electrostatic forces between the two surfaces, without identifying the orientation of
the charge domains on the two surfaces or the detailed surface charge distribution. More advanced characterization methods such as Electrostatic Force
Microscopy (EFM) and Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM) can map
the charge distribution on the material surface and provide more information
on charge domains, which may be useful for future investigations.
4.2. Implications for aeolian processes on Titan
Dunes on Titan are spectrally dark (Soderblom et al., 2007), while most
simple organics (e.g., solid benzene, ethylene, acetylene) are spectrally bright
(Clark et al., 2010), thus they are unlikely to be the only constituents of Titan
sand. A spectrally darker material like tholin would be a better analog for
Titan’s surface sand than the spectrally bright simple organics. If that is the
case, our study would suggest that Titan sand may be unlikely to be formed
by triboelectric coagulation from the aerosol particles, while high cohesion
between the material would instead be more viable (Yu et al., 2017b). As
discussed in Méndez-Harper et al., (2017), Titan’s cold temperature and low
water humidity could help preserve the charges better if electrostatic charges
are produced. However, our experiments show that under room temperature
and low water humidity, tholin has minimal tribocharging capacity (Figure
5). Under the same conditions, glass, an analog for Earth sand, generates
detectable electrostatic charges. Thus, tribocharging of Titan sand may not
be as strong as previously expected by Méndez-Harper et al., (2017). The
triboelectric effect could be also weaker for Titan sand compared to silicate
Earth sand. In other words, tribocharging may not significantly increase the
threshold wind speed on Titan compared to on Earth.
4.3. Implications for lightning on Titan
Electrification of granular materials can result in the build-up of significant electrical charges on a material surface. When the charge becomes high
14

enough, the electrical field that develops between surfaces can exceed the
threshold dielectric strength, leading to electrical breakdown and discharge
of the gas in between. Convective clouds are common sources for lightning,
but sand storms could also generated lightning if the breakdown voltage is
reached through triboelectric charging (Tokano et al., 2001). The dielectric strength of Titan’s atmosphere in the troposphere is similar to Earth’s
troposphere (Fisher et al., 2004), around 3×106 V/m. However, no lightning has been detected on Titan so far (Fischer and Gurnett, 2011), even
though global sand storms were observed during Titan’s equinox (Rodriguez
et al., 2018). Lightning often occurs in very energetic dusty systems, while
our experimental system cannot reproduce similar energetic environments.
However, lightning is also linked to a material’s tribocharging capacity. Our
results suggest that Titan’s sand may not be strongly charged due to the low
charging capacity of tholin, which may contribute to the observation that no
lightning has been detected so far on Titan. Thus electrical discharge generated by sand storms may not be an issue for future surface or near-surface
missions on Titan through tribocharging.
5. Conclusion
To understand the effect of electrification for dune formation on Titan,
we performed contact and triboelectric charging between possible organic
candidates using colloidal atomic force microscopy. This technique can characterize individual charging processes and avoid contamination between the
surfaces. The simple organic naphthalene and the simple hydrocarbon polymer polystyrene were found to be charged very easily against themselves from
repeated contacts, so is for Earth silicate sand. While the complex organic,
tholin, did not generate any detectable electrostatic attraction (<10−15 C)
after even the most violent tribocharging that the instrument is capable of.
Our study indicates that the charging abilities of Titan sand may be much
weaker than previously expected from Méndez-Harper et al., (2017). If Titan
sand is similar in composition to the complex organic, tholin, then the triboelectric effect could be weaker on Titan than on Earth. Thus, triboelectric
charging and the resulting electrostatic forces may not be as important as
van der Waals forces (Yu et al., 2017a,b) for Titan sand. Thus the threshold
wind speed will not increase due to sand tribocharging on Titan. Our study
also agrees with the observation that no lightning was generated on Titan
(Fischer and Gurnett, 2011), even though large sand storms were observed
15

during the search period (Rodriguez et al., 2018).

Figure 1: (a) The AFM setup used for the charging and electrostatic force measurements.
All the experiments were done under RH<1%. Contact charging was done by repeated
contacting the material particle to the material surface, while tribocharging was done by
using the material particle to scan across the material surface. (b) Before and after each
charging experiment, force-distance curves were taken using the AFM. Here is a typical
force curve between a colloidal probe and a smooth surface, the different interaction phases
are described in Yu et al., (2017b). Here we mostly focus on the jump-in forces before
the particle contacts the surface and the pull-off forces when the particle was retracted
from the surface. The jump-in forces in 22
our study could include short-range van der
Waals forces and long-range electrostatic forces, while the pull-off forces are equal to the
adhesion/cohesion forces between the probe and the surface.

Figure 2: Force-distance curves taken between a glass colloidal AFM probe and a cleaved
mica surface before and after a series of charging events in a dry nitrogen atmosphere
(RH<1%). (a) Force curve before charging, it has very weak jump-in forces and some
short-range pull-off forces. (b) Force curve after contact charging, which is similar to the
force curve before charging. (c) The force curve immediately after tribocharging. The
jump-in and pull-off forces after charging become both larger and in longer range than
before charging. (d) The 30th force curve after tribocharging shows charge damping. The
jump-in forces are not long range any more but the magnitude of the pull-off forces remains
similar as just after tribocharging.

Figure 3: Force-distance curves taken between a naphthalene-coated colloidal AFM probe
and naphthalene-coated surface, before charging and after contact charging. The jumpin and pull-off forces after charging become both larger and in longer range than before
charging.

Figure 4: (a) Force-distance curves taken between a tholin-coated colloidal probe and
tholin-coated surface, before charging and after tribocharging. The jump-in forces are
very small for both cases and the pull-off forces are smaller after tribocharging than before charging. (b) An SEM image of the tholin colloidal probe after multiple cycles of
tribocharging (frictional rubbing), as shown in the image, visible cracks are developed
indicating the brittle nature of tholin as measured by Yu et al., (2018).
