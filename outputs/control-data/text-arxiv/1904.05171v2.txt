Using a time-resolved optically-pumped scanning optical microscopy technique we demonstrate
the laser-driven excitation and propagation of spin waves in a 20-nm film of a ferromagnetic metallic
alloy Galfenol epitaxially grown on a GaAs substrate. In contrast to previous all-optical studies
of spin waves we employ laser-induced thermal changes of magnetocrystalline anisotropy as an
excitation mechanism. A tightly focused 70-fs laser pulse excites packets of magnetostatic surface
waves with an e−1 -propagation length of 3.4 µm, which is comparable with that of permalloy.
As a result, laser-driven magnetostatic spin waves are clearly detectable at distances in excess
of 10 µm, which promotes epitaxial Galfenol films to the limited family of materials suitable for
magnonic devices. A pronounced in-plane magnetocrystalline anisotropy of the Galfenol film offers
an additional degree of freedom for manipulating the spin waves’ parameters. Reorientation of
an in-plane external magnetic field relative to the crystallographic axes of the sample tunes the
frequency, amplitude and propagation length of the excited waves.

INTRODUCTION

In magnonics coherent spin waves (SWs) are employed
for encoding, transferring, and processing information [1–
3]. The use of SWs enables scaling of magnonic elements
down to the nanometer range owing to short wavelengths
and the reduction of Joule heating associated with the
charge transfer in conventional electronics. Moreover, an
extended functionality of magnonic devices is provided
by the possibility to manipulate the amplitudes, phases,
and wavevectors of SWs. Progress in the field of magnonics relies on the development of approaches to generate
and transfer SWs in a controllable manner. Efficient
conversion mechanisms between electrical/optical pulses
and collective magnetic excitations are required to couple magnonic elements to electronic and photonic units
[4–6]. For rapid growth of the field of magnonics, it is
essential to extend the range of materials and structures
supporting long SWs propagation distances and enabling
their control [7–11].
Optical radiation allows the magnetic parameters of
materials to be altered reversibly at various timescales
down to femtoseconds [12, 13]. This has led to the emergence of a photo-magnonics [14–20], where laser pulses
are employed as a tool for both driving SWs and manipulating their propagation. In particular, it has been
demonstrated that femtosecond laser pulses enable excitation of SWs with controlled wavevectors and propagation directions [18, 21–23]. However, up to now the effects
of short laser pulses employed to drive SWs have been
limited to ultrafast opto-magnetic phenomena [18, 21–
25], ultrafast demagnetization [17, 26–29], and coherent
energy transfer from elastic waves to the magnon subsystem [24, 30–33]. These mechanisms place constraints
on the properties of the media, the laser pulse parame-

ters, and the excitation geometries, while the excitation
of propagating SWs by other ultrafast magnetic phenomena [13] remains unexplored. Furthermore, the range of
materials where the optical generation of SWs has been
realized is also very limited and, in fact, coincides with
the known suitable media for magnonics [3].
In this Article we examine the feasibility and advantages of excitation of propagating SWs in an anisotropic
ferromagnetic film by ultrafast laser-induced thermal
changes of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy. Using
time-resolved optically pumped scanning optical microscopy (TROPSOM) [17], we reveal propagating magnetostatic surface waves (MSSWs) excited by a femtosecond laser pulse in a thin film of a ferromagnetic metallic alloy Galfenol (Fe0.81 Ga0.19 ) epitaxially grown on a
GaAs substrate. We demonstrate that the propagating MSSWs packets are launched via the laser-induced
thermal decrease of the magnetic anisotropy occurring
on a picosecond time scale and localized within the excitation spot. Owing to this excitation mechanism, the
MSSWs are excited in a simple geometry with an inplane external magnetic field, and their characteristics
can be controlled by the orientation of the in-plane field
with respect to the magnetocrystalline anisotropy axes
of the film. We show that the 20-nm thick Galfenol
film supports an e−1 -propagation length of MSSWs as
large as 3.4 µm, comparable to that of Permalloy – a
model metallic material for magnonics [3]. Our results
promote epitaxial Galfenol to the limited family of materials for magnon-spintronics, reconfigurable magnonics,
and ultrafast photo-magnonics. Furthermore, the ultrafast thermal changes of magnetic anisotropy as a driving
mechanism for the excitation of propagating SWs can
be applied to a broad range of materials without specific constraints imposed on their electronic and magnetic
structures [34].

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS
A.

Sample

For our study, we chose a film of Fe0.81 Ga0.19 with
a thickness d = 20 nm epitaxially grown on a 350-µm
thick (001)-GaAs substrate by magnetron sputtering, as
described elsewhere [35]. The Galfenol film was capped
with 3-nm thick Al and 120-nm thick SiO2 protective
layers. The back-side of the substrate was polished to
optical quality. X-ray diffractometry showed that the
Galfenol film has a mosaic structure with grain sizes of
∼12 nm, and their crystallographic axes misorientation
of ∼1.3 deg. It is well established that thin films of iron
and iron-based alloys epitaxially grown on GaAs exhibit
intrinsic cubic and substrate-induced in-plane uniaxial
magnetic anisotropies [36–39]. In particular, in Galfenol
films on (001)-GaAs substrates the uniaxial anisotropy
axis emerges along the [110] direction [35, 40].

Experimental setup

Optically-excited SWs were studied using the
TROPSOM setup which enables detection of the spatialtemporal evolution of the polar magneto-optical Kerr
rotation ∆θk proportional to the transient changes of the
out-of-plane magnetization component Mz [Fig. 1]. Here
xyz is the laboratory frame with the z−axis directed
along the sample normal and the x−axis chosen to be
along the direction of an external DC magnetic field H.
Optical pulses with nominal duration of 70 fs, central
wavelength of 1050 nm, and 70 MHz repetition rate
generated by the Yb-doped solid-state oscillator laser
system were split into pump and probe parts. The
central wavelength of the pump pulses was converted to
525 nm using a β-BaB2 O4 crystal. The amplitude of the
pump pulses was periodically modulated at a frequency
of 84 kHz using a photoelastic modulator placed between
two crossed Glan-Taylor prisms.
Two microscope
objectives were used to focus the pump and probe pulses
onto the Galfenol film from the cap and the substrate

the MSSW dispersion relation specific to the anisotropic
FeGa film, calculations of the main MSSWs’ parameters
and their comparison to those obtained experimentally
(III E). In Sec. IV we summarize our findings and discuss their possible impact on the field of magnonics.

20 times lower. The microobjective for the probe pulses

mounted on the piezoelectric stage, which moves in the

∆x, ∆y between the pump and probe pulses. The
pump-probe temporal delay t was controlled by a delay
line in the pump pulse optical path. In the experiments
the temporal dependences ∆θk (t) of probe were obtained
at various pump-probe displacements ∆x, ∆y, and at
various azimuthal orientations of the sample defined by
the angle ϕ between the [100] crystallographic axis and
the x-axis. The probe polarization rotation ∆θk (t) was
detected using a conventional scheme with a Wollaston
prism and a balanced photodetector. The signal from the
photodetector was registered using a lock-in technique
with the reference frequency of the pump amplitude
modulation. Thus, only the probe polarization rotation
related to the pump-induced dynamics was detected.
The measurements of SWs propagation were performed
at room temperature and H = 100 mT.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND
DISCUSSION

Laser-induced excitation of propagating spin
waves

Figures 2(a,b) show the spatial-temporal evolution of
∆θK obtained by scanning the pump-probe time delay t
when the pump and probe spots are shifted with respect
to each other by 0 ≤ ∆y ≤ 12 µm at ∆x = 0, i.e. transversely to H. Experimental data for two orientations of
the sample ϕ = 45◦ and ϕ = 60o are presented. The former geometry corresponds to the field applied along the
film hard axis [110]. Two types of pump-induced signal
∆θK (t) can be distinguished depending on whether the
pump and probe spots overlap spatially or not. We show
this in more detail in Fig. 2(c), where the cross-sections of
the spatial-temporal maps at various ∆y are presented.
When the√pump and probe spots overlap spatially, i.e.
at ∆y < 2σ, decaying oscillations of ∆θK (t) are observed. Examination of the dependence of the oscillation frequency on the external field strength [Fig. 2(e)]
confirms that they originate from the laser-induced precession of the magnetization. Outside
the pump-probe
√
spatial overlap, i.e. at ∆y > 2σ, well-defined wavepackets are observed in the ∆θK (t) signal. The tilts of
the signal maxima reveal a positive phase shift of the

propagating waves. Therefore, these wave-packets can
be confidently ascribed to laser-induced MSSWs propagating transversely to H.
Spatial-temporal ∆x − t maps obtained at ∆y = 0
(Fig. 2(d)) have revealed the presence of fast-decaying
backward volume magnetostatic waves (BVMSWs) with
negative phase shifts. Such a difference in the propagation characters of laser-driven MSSWs and BVMSWs appears to be typical for thin metallic films [26–28]. Below
we focus our discussion on the excitation and propagation
of the MSSWs.
As can be seen in Figs. 2(a,b), the parameters of the
magnetization precession at ∆y = 0 and of the MSSWs
at ∆y 6= 0 vary with ϕ. To quantify the azimuthal dependences of the parameters, we fitted temporal signals
∆θK (t) obtained at different ϕ and ∆y with either of the
functions:
∆θK (∆y = 0, t) = A0SW sin(2πf0 t − φ0 )e−t/τ ,
∆θK (∆y, t) = ASW (∆y) sin(2πf t − φ)e

Here A0SW , ASW (∆y) are amplitudes of the precession at
∆y = 0 and ∆y > 0, respectively; τ , f0 and f , φ0 and φ
are the decay time, frequencies, and initial phases of the
precession; w and t0 – width and center position of the
Gaussian packet. Good agreement between the experimental data and the fitted curves is reached [Fig. 2(c)],

4
apart from a small discrepancy at the tails of the precession and wavepackets, which is addressed below in
Sec. III E.

Mechanism of MSSWs’ excitation

Figures 3 (a,b) show the azimuthal dependences f0 (ϕ)
and A0SW (ϕ) at ∆y = 0. The former has a pronounced
4-fold symmetry with a 2-fold distortion. It corresponds
well to the intrinsic cubic magnetic anisotropy defined by
the anisotropy parameter K1 > 0 with easy axes along
[100] and [010] and the substrate-induced in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy defined by the parameter Ku < 0
with an easy axis along [110] expected for such films [38].
A pronounced azimuthal dependence of the amplitude
A0SW (ϕ) of the laser-driven precession [Fig. 3(b)] allows us to identify the excitation mechanism as an ultrafast laser-induced thermal change of the effective magnetocrystalline anisotropy field demonstrated earlier for
a range of Galfenol films of various thicknesses [41, 42].
In brief, excitation of the precession stems from a rapid
decrease of the anisotropy parameters K1 and Ku [43–
45] and of the saturation magnetization Ms [46] in response to the laser-induced increase of electronic and lattice temperatures. For the in-plane orientation of external magnetic field considered here, the amplitude of the
excited precession is a measure of the abrupt reorientation of the total effective field in the sample plane due
to the laser-induced changes of K1 /Ms and Ku /Ms . At
the timescale longer than the electron-phonon thermalization time ∼2 ps, the thermodynamic approximation
for the temperature dependence of anisotropy can be applied [47]. Thus, the decrease of the parameters K1 , Ku
is expected to be stronger than that of the magnetization
Ms , and, therefore, the laser excitation yields an abrupt
decrease of the effective anisotropy field. Experimentally
verified independence of the ∆θk (t) signal on the pump
pulse’s polarization supports the thermal nature of the
excitation mechanism.
In the following we refer to the MSSWs excitation mechanism based on laser-induced thermal change
of the effective magnetocrystalline anisotropy field
∼ (K1 + Ku )/Ms as the ultrafast laser-induced change
of the magnetic anisotropy. This is to distinguish it from
the excitation of the MSSWs via ultrafast changes of the
shape anisotropy related to the demagnetization solely
and demonstrated in [17, 26–29, 48]. The latter mechanism is deliberately excluded here by the chosen experimental geometry with an in-plane external magnetic
field. We can also exclude two other mechanisms of laserinduced MSSWs’ excitation reported earlier. Ultrafast
inverse magneto-optical effects employed in [18, 21–25]
are proven to be efficient in dielectric media mostly (for a
review see e.g. [49]), and are pump-polarization sensitive
which was not the case in our experiments. Driving SWs
by optically-excited elastic waves shown in [24, 30–33]
can, in turn, work in any material with sufficiently strong

magnetoelastic coupling at any laser-pulse polarization.
Furthermore, the magnetoelastic properties of Galfenol
favor such a mechanism. However, excitation of SWs by
elastic waves becomes efficient only near the crossing of
their dispersion curves [50], which is not realized in the
studied film in the range of the applied magnetic fields
used in the experiments (see details in Sec. III D). Nevertheless, in the experiments we have detected two acoustic waves seen as two concentric ripples independently
propagating slower than the SWs, in analogy with the
observations reported in [17].

MSSWs’ propagation length

The azimuthal dependence of the MSSW’s amplitude
ASW (ϕ) at ∆y = 0.5 µm, i.e. close to the edge of the
excitation √
spot, naturally resembles the one for A0SW .
At ∆y > 2σ the situation changes drastically, as the
amplitudes of the MSSWs packets outside the excitation
spot are defined not only by the efficiency of excitation at
the specific field direction [Fig. 3(b)], but by the spatial
decay as well. To single out the latter contribution, we
plot the spatial dependence of the normalized amplitudes
of the MSSWs packets ASW (∆y)/ASW (∆y = 0.5 µm)
[Fig. 3(c)]. The spatial decay is minimum at ϕ = ±45◦
in the so-called ”hard-hard” configuration, where the
equilibrium magnetization and the MSSW’s wavevector

Reconstruction of MSSW dispersion

The ∆y − t maps presented in Figs. 2(a,b) allow us to
reconstruct the dispersion relation f (ky ) for the excited
MSSWs using a 2-dimensional fast Fourier transform
(2D-FFT) of the data outside the pump spot [24, 27, 32].
Figure 4(a) shows the 2D-FFT result for ϕ = 45◦ , at
which the MSSWs possess large Lprop (see Sec. III C).
The 2D-FFT gives an expected near-linear dispersion and
shows that the wavenumbers ky of the MSSWs detected
in the experiment reach about 3.5 rad/µm. As discussed
in Ref. [27] the wavenumbers of the SWs detected in the
optical pump-probe experiment are limited by both the
pump and probe spot sizes, √which yields kσ = 1/σ for
the wavenumbers at the 1/ e-level (see Appendix for
details). Given the spot size σ used in the experiment,
the corresponding value is kσ = 1.3 rad/µm, and the experimentally found largest value 3.5 rad/µm corresponds
approximately to 3kσ . The value also confirms that the
observed MSSWs are not driven by propagating surface
acoustic waves (SAWs) in the GaAs substrate. Indeed,
the SAWs velocity in a (001)-GaAs substrate is 2.7 km/s
[51], which gives a maximum SAW frequency of 1.5 GHz
at a wavenumber of 3.5 rad/µm. The value is well below
the frequencies of the excited MSSWs.
It is important to note that the laser-induced heating and the changes of magnetization and anisotropy are
expected to alter the precession frequency f within the
pump spot. These changes, indeed, can be clearly seen in
f −∆y maps, where f is obtained as the FFT of θK (t) at a
specific position ∆y [Fig. 4(b,c)]. For H applied along the
hard axis (ϕ = 45◦ ) f experiences an increase inside the
heated area. If H is not aligned with the hard axis (e.g.
at ϕ = 30◦ ), the situation is opposite, and f is decreased

with Lprop being the propagation length. This is an
important parameter of SWs, which, in particular, determines whether Galfenol is a suitable material for
magnonic applications. As can be seen in Fig. 3(d), Lprop
demonstrates a pronounced azimuthal dependence with
two maxima corresponding to the geometries with H applied along the hard axes. The largest Lprop = 3.4 µm is
observed when H is aligned along the hardest anisotropy
axis [110]. Importantly, this value is very close to the
propagation length found for optically excited MSSWs
in a 20-nm thick Permalloy film [26].

the MSSWs packets propagate larger distances along the
hard axes, despite small initial amplitudes defined by
the excitation mechanism. In contrast, no propagating
MSSWs packets are observed if H is directed close to
the easy axes (ϕ = 0◦ , ±90◦ ), and the small amplitude
precession is excited.
The experimental dependences ASW (∆y) can be well
fitted by a single exponential decay function [Fig. 3(c)]:

inside the pump spot. Both observations are in agreement with the scenario of the magnetic anisotropy being
decreased abruptly within the laser-excited spot. Indeed,
in the ”hard-hard” configuration the laser-induced ultrafast heating partly suppresses the effective anisotropy
field Ha resulting in an increase of f at H > Ha , as
schematically illustrated in Fig.4(d). The opposite situation is expected in the ”easy-easy” configuration [see
Fig.4(e)].
It should be noted that the laser-induced local decrease
of the eigen frequency f0 can lead to the formation of
a potential well for MSSWs, with eigen frequencies below the spectrum of MSSWs outside this well, as demonstrated in Ref. [52]. Then the escape of the MSSWs from
this well would be strongly suppressed. We do not observe the formation of such traps as they are formed,
when the diameter of the hot spot is several times larger
than the MSSW wavelength. In our pump-probe experiments the shortest excited MSSW wavelength is comparable to the pump spot size. In other words, when the
pump spot size becomes comparable to the length scale
defined by the ratio of the group velocity of a MSSW
to f0 , the precession of the magnetization propagates as
MSSWs from the pump spot to the non-excited area [27].

Theoretical analysis

Dispersion of magnetostatic waves in an anisotropic film

In order to obtain the expression for the spin wave
dispersion f (k) we utilized the approach developed in
Ref. [53] and adapted it to the particular anisotropy of
the studied film. The basic expression for the film’s free
energy density used in our calculations has the form:
∆F = K1 (m21 m22 + m21 m23 + m22 m23 )
+ Ku m1 m2 − µ0 Ms m · H, (4)
where m is the unit vector in the magnetization direction,
and mi is its projection on the crystallographic axis xi
[see inset in Fig. 1]. The form of the in-plane anisotropy
term Ku m1 m2 was chosen after Ref. [38] to accommodate our system of an iron-based alloy grown on a (001)GaAs substrate. Note that Eq. (4) does not contain the
magnetostatic energy term. In the derivation of the dispersion relation the demagnetizing field is accounted for
separately by solving the Maxwell’s equations. Applying the procedures of Ref. [53] to the free enery density
given by Eq. 4, we obtained a transcendental equation
connecting f and k, which can be simplified and written
in a closed form in the limit kd  1 relevant in our case
[54], yielding the dispersion relation for magnetostatic
waves to be:

The discrepancy between the solution of the exact
transcendental equation for f (k) and its approximation
(5) is negligible at k < 5 rad/µm and d = 20 nm. We
note that at k = 0, i.e. in the case of a homogeneous
magnetization precession, Eq. (5) gives exactly the same
dependence f0 (ϕ) as the analytical formula for ferromagnetic resonance frequency in a thin anisotropic film [55].
Having obtained the explicit dispersion relation, we
derived the expression for the precession ellipticity:

|Bα + µ0 Ms (1 − kd/2)|
=

|Mz |
|Bβ + µ0 Ms (kd/2) sin2 ψ|
where ∆Mxy and Mz are the transient changes of inplane and out-of-plane components of the magnetization
precession, respectively. The damping factor as a function of ϕ and k can be found using the relation Ref. [56]:
α = α0

=γ

(9)

where α0 is the Gilbert damping of the precession in the
external field H at k = 0 without the account of demagnetization effects and anisotropy. It is interesting to note
that Eq. (9) leads to an anisotropic damping with higher
and lower values when the magnetization is aligned along
hard and easy axes, respectively.
Once the Gilbert damping parameter is known, the
formula for the propagation length Lprop can be written
in a straightforward way as:

Analysis of the magnetization precession within the
excitation spot

In order to apply the expressions derived above for
a description of the experimentally observed magnetization dynamics, one needs to account for the timescales
of the laser-induced changes of magnetic anisotropy and
magnetization. In metals a few picoseconds after excitation both magnetization and magnetic anisotropy possess
slow relaxations which can be neglected on the timescales
where the precession is observed. Thus, the temporal
profile of the total effective field ∼ (K1 + Ku )/Ms is described below by the Heaviside function.
By analyzing the experimental dependences f0 (ϕ) and
A0SW (ϕ) within the pump spot, we extract the anisotropy
parameters K1 , Ku and saturation magnetization Ms of
the excited and equilibrium film, using the following
procedure. First, the frequency f0 within pump spot
is defined by modified parameters K1 , Ku , and Ms of
the laser-exited material. Fitting the experimental dependence f0 (ϕ) to Eq. (5) with k = 0 [solid line in

7
Fig.3(a)] we get µ0 Ms = 1.56 T, K1 = 2.8 × 104 J/m3
and Ku = −1 × 104 J/m3 .
Having determined the parameters of the film within
the laser-excited area, we now can extract the laserinduced changes of the anisotropy parameters K1 and
Ku with respect to their room temperature (RT) values by analyzing the azimuthal dependence A0SW (ϕ) of
the laser-excited precession [Fig.3(b)]. Indeed, two sets
of the parameters, the initial K̃1 , K˜u and M̃s at RT
and the modified K1 , Ku and Ms of the laser-excited
film, yield the difference between the effective field orientation at equilibrium and upon the excitation. This
difference defines the amplitude of the in-plane compo0
nent ∆Mxy
of the precession. The amplitude of the
out-of-plane component ∆Mz0 can be then found taking
into account the precession ellipticity (8). The fitting
of A0SW (ϕ) ∼ ∆Mz0 then gives the ratios K̃1 /M̃s and
K˜u /M̃s . Using the experimental value of the RT saturation magnetization µ0 M̃s = 1.7 T [57, 58], we obtain
the RT anisotropy parameters K̃1 = 3.33 × 104 J/m3 and
K˜u = −1.03 × 104 J/m3 , which are in a very good agreement with the anisotropy parameters found earlier for a
22-nm FeGa film on a (001) GaAs substrate [58]. We note
that the laser-induced change ∆K1 /K̃1 ≈ −16% shows
rather good agreement with the one reported earlier for a
100-nm Galfenol film [41], while ∆Ms /M̃s ≈ −8% agrees
with the magnitude of the ultrafast demagnetization observed in a thinner Galfenol film [42].

Analysis of the laser-driven spin waves propagation

In order to explain the observed azimuthal dependence Lprop (ϕ), we used Eq. (10). The fitting procedure
at k = 1rad/µm gives the Gilbert damping parameter
α0 = 0.017. As can be seen in Fig. 3(d), Eqs. (9,10)
correctly predict the azimuthal dependence of MSSWs’
propagation. In particular, the theory confirms that the
different propagation lengths for different misorientations
between the H and MSSW’s wavevector are dictated by
the anisotropy of the film. We note that the observed
anisotropy of the propagation of the laser-driven MSSWs
packets is in agreement with the one demonstrated in cubic iron films recently [59]. In both cases the largest propagation length is observed in the ”hard-hard” configuration. In contrast to the experiments with antennae [59],
where the MSSWs’ propagation is one-dimensional, laserinduced MSSWs packets propagating along the y−axis
are spreading slightly along the x−axis as well. Our results show that this spreading does not change the main
features of the propagation of MSSWs packets.
Theoretically obtained MSSWs’ group velocities vgr
are in the range of 5-9 km/s, and are in an agreement
with the experimental values of 4.5-13 km/s. These values of group velocities are typical for MSSWs in thin
metallic films [3].
Finally, having obtained the MSSWs’ parameters, in-

cluding the anisotropic damping α, we have calculated
spatial-temporal ∆y − t maps at different ϕ, following
the procedure described in [18, 21, 24, 27]. In this approach the dispersion relation (5) for MSSWs was used.
Within the area corresponding to the excitation spot the
additional effective field with the Heaviside temporal and
Gaussian spatial profiles were introduced to account for
the localized change of magnetic anisotropy triggering
the precession (see Appendix for details). Figure 2(f)
shows exemplary crossections of the calculated ∆y − t
maps demonstrating good agreement with the experimental data. The calculations show good agreement with
experimentally obtained precession and MSSWs packets [Fig. 2(c,f)]. Importantly, the calculations reveal the
same deviation of the MSSW packets’ shapes from the
Gaussian ones as the experimentally observed signals
∆θK (t), evident in Figs. 2(c,f). The most prominent deviation is observed at large time delays t, i.e. at the tails
of the wavepackets, as was noted by other groups as well
[26, 27, 60]. Our calculations based on the MSSWs’ dispersion relation show that this deviation originates from
the dispersion of SWs generated by a sudden change of
effective field.

IV.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, we have demonstrated laser-induced excitation and propagation of magnetostatic spin waves in
a 20 nm thick epitaxial Galfenol film on a GaAs substrate characterized by pronounced in-plane magnetic
anisotropy. We have shown that ultrafast thermal magnetic anisotropy changes induced by tightly focused femtosecond laser pulses excite propagating MSSWs. The
strong in-plane anisotropy (∼104 J/m3 ) of the film enables the laser-induced excitation of MSSWs in a simple geometry with an in-plane external magnetic field.
The anisotropy of the film provides the possibility to
tune the frequency, amplitude and propagation length
of the excited waves by changing the in-plane field orientation. We find that the propagation length of the
MSSWs in the studied film reaches 3.4 µm, which, along
with other recent results on spin dynamics in Galfenol
films [40, 42, 61], confidently promotes epitaxial Galfenol
to the limited family of metallic materials for magnonics.
Furthermore, epitaxial Galfenol is also known for having a large magnetostriction constant [58] and so offers
the prospect of controlling the SWs propagation via a
voltage-induced strain when, for example, coupled to a
piezoelectric substrate, as was earlier realized in YIG [11].
It is important to note that the laser-induced thermal
magnetocrystalline anisotropy change represents a novel
fundamental process for the excitation of SWs, which
can be applied to a broad range of materials without
limitations on their electronic and magnetic structures.
Finally, we note that introducing laser-induced ultrafast
thermal changes of magnetic anisotropy as a tool to generate SWs can have even broader impact on magnon-

ics. Since abrupt and local changes of the magnetic
anisotropy by laser pulses yield strong local modifications of the SWs’ dispersion relation, they can be seen as
a pathway to realize an ultrafast optically-reconfigurable
magnonic medium for efficient steering and conversion of
SWs [15, 16, 62, 63].

we used the procedure described in Refs. [18, 21, 24, 27].
The probe pulses are reflected normally, so the change of
their polarization is a measure of the transient changes of

APPENDIX: CALCULATION OF
SPATIAL-TEMPORAL MAPS
OF LASER-DRIVEN SPIN WAVES

To calculate the spatial-temporal dependences of
∆θK (r, t) corresponding to the experimental ∆y−t maps,

where h(k, ω) is the Fourier transform of h(r, t) - an effective field describing the effect of the laser pulse excitation
of the sample,  is the ellipticity (8), α is the damping
parameter (9).
We consider the case of thermal changes of anisotropy,
which are approximated by the laser-induced effective field introduced as the difference between the
total effective field in the equilibrium and laserexcited states h(r, t) = −∂∆F (K̃1 , K˜u , M̃s )/∂M +
∂∆F (K1 (r, t), Ku (r, t), Ms (r, t))/∂M [45]. It is assumed
that a few picoseconds after excitation both the magnetization and magnetic anisotropy possess slow relaxation which can be neglected on the time scales of the
magnetization precession. Thus, the field h(r, t) may be
rewritten as h(r, t) ∼ h(r)Θ(t), where Θ(t) is a Heaviside function. Hence, the Fourier transform h(k, ω)
at ω 6= 0 is weighted by i/ω [24]. Next, the pump
beam in our experiments has a spatial profile close to

9

the Gaussian one, i.e. h(r) ∼ exp(−r2 /2σ
√ ). There2 2
0
fore, h(k, ω) ∼ exp(−k σ /2). Thus, kσ = 2/σ gives a
wavenumber for the√excited SW component which amplitude is at a level 1/ e of the component with the highest
amplitude. It is also important to take into account that
the probe spot radius in our experiment is σ, as well.
As a result, the measured
√ wavevnumbers are defined by
an effective width of 2σ [27], and the corresponding
wavenumber is kσ = 1/σ.
Using the procedure described above, the maps of
Mz (r, t) were calculated in the time interval 0–1500 ps for
different ϕ. Calculations were performed for kx , ky with

3kσ . Calculated ∆y − t maps are in a good agreement
with the experiment.
Figure 5 shows the calculated z-component of the magnetization as a function of ∆x, ∆y at different time delays t =0.3, 0.7, and 1 ns (see also supplementary animation file). Excited SWs are mainly propagating in the
y-direction with a pronounced X-shaped pattern. Similar
2-dimensional maps for a Permalloy film are discussed in
the Supplemental Material of Ref. [26]. Slight spreading
of the SWs in the x-direction is clearly seen.
