Abstract
We study chaotic inflation with a Galileon-like self interaction G(φ, X)φ, where G(φ, X) ∝ X n .
General conditions required for successful inflation are deduced and discussed from the background
and cosmological perturbations under slow-roll approximation. Interestingly, it is found that in the
regime where the Galileon term dominates over the standard kinetic term, the tensor-to-scalar ratio
becomes significantly suppressed in comparison to the standard expression in General Relativity
(GR). Particularly, we find the allowed range in the space of parameters characterizing the chaotic
quadratic and quartic inflation models by considering the current observational data of Planck
from the nS − r plane. Finally, we discuss about the issue if the Galileon term is dominant by the
end of inflation, this can affect the field oscillation during reheating.

INTRODUCTION

During the longest part of its lifetime, the universe has undergone a decelerating expansion, being dominated first by radiation and then by matter. However, there are two phases
of accelerated expansion in the history of the universe at very early times and late-times as
well. The first accelerating phase corresponds to inflation [1–4], which is widely accepted as
the standard paradigm for describing the physics of the early universe. The first reason is
due to the fact that several long-standing puzzles of the hot big-bang model (HBB), such as
the horizon, flatness, and monopole problems, find a natural explanation in the framework
of inflationary universe. In addition, and perhaps the most intriguing feature of inflation,
is that it gives us a causal explanation of the origin of the cosmic microwave background
(CMB) temperature anisotropies [5], while at the same time it provides us with a mechanism
to explain the large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe, since quantum fluctuations during
the inflationary era may give rise to the primordial density perturbations [6–11].
The dynamics of inflation can be studied under the so-called the slow-roll approximation
(see, e.g. [12]). When the slow-roll approximation breaks down inflation ends and the
universe enters into the radiation era of standard hot big-bang cosmology. The transition
era after the end of inflation, during which the inflaton is converted into the particles that
populate the universe later on is called reheating [13, 14], the physics of which is complicated,
highly uncertain, and in addition it cannot be directly probed by observations. One may
obtain, however, indirect constraints on reheating according to the following strategy: First
we parametrize our ignorance assuming for the fluid a constant equation-of-state wre during
reheating, and then we find certain relations between the duration of reheating Nre and the
reheating temperature Tre with wre and inflationary observables [15–17].
The second accelerating phase of the universe corresponds to the current cosmic acceleration supported from type Ia Supernovae data [18, 19], CMB data [20–22] as well as Baryon
Acoustic Oscillation data [23, 24]. The most economical ΛCDM model, which is based on a
positive cosmological constant and cold dark matter, suffers from the cosmological constant
problem [25]. Large-scale modifications of General Relativity (GR), such as f (R) theories of gravity [26, 27], Brans-Dicke theory (BD) [28], DGP brane model [29] and Galileon
gravity [30], are capable of explaining the late-time acceleration of the universe without a
cosmological constant. For a review on modified gravity and Cosmology see e.g. [31]. In
2

a little known paper in 1974 Horndeski found the most general scalar-tensor theory having
second order equations of motion [32]. It turns out [33] that Horndeski’s theory includes
both the canonical scalar field and k-essence [34], while at the same time accommodates
f (R) theories, BD theory and galileon gravity [35–38]. The Horndeski theory provides us
with a general framework to accounting for the current accelerated expansion of the universe and the inflationary phase of the very early universe as well. For a review on current
status of Horndeski’s theory see e.g. [39]. Regarding the observational constraints, specially
those coming from measurement of the speed of gravitational waves (GWs) cGW , restrict
dramatically Horndeski’s theory. The nearly simultaneous detection of gravitational waves
GW170817 and the γ-ray burst GRB 170817A provides a tight constraint on cGW [40, 41]
− 3 × 10−15 < cGW − 1 < 7 × 10−16 ,

(1)

which basically means that GWs propagate at the speed of light. Then, in order to have
cGW = 1 irrespective of the background cosmological evolution within Horndeski’s theory,
its Lagrangian is restricted to be [42, 43]
L = f (φ) R + K(φ, X) − G(φ, X) φ,

(2)

leaving this theory constructed only with non-minimally coupling, k-essence, and cubic
Galileon sectors.
Although single-field slow-roll inflation in GR provides us with the best fit to the data
[44], considering alternative, non-standard scenarios, are motivated by the fact that certain
scalar potentials for the inflaton coming from Particle Physics [45–47], such as the chaotic
quadratic or the chaotic quartic ones [48], are ruled out by current data. More generally, the
monomial potential V (φ) = V0 (φ/Mpl )p is ruled out by Planck 2018 data for p ≥ 2 [44]. For
instance, a non-minimal coupling to gravity can save the quartic potential [49, 50]. Potentialdriven Galileon inflation was studied in [51, 52] for a Galileon-self coupling of the form
G(φ, X) = −X/M 3 , bringing chaotic inflation to be compatible with current observations
on the tensor-to-scalar ratio available at that time [20]. Nevertheless, the latest data from the
Keck Array/BICEP2 and Planck collaborations [53] constraints robustly the tensor-to-scalar
ratio. In this direction, in [54] it was studied G-inflation with a generalized expression for
the Galileon-self coupling given by G(φ, X) ∝ X n (suggested for the first time in [55]), while
in [56] the authors proposed the generalization G(φ, X) ∝ φν X n . In both aforementioned
3

works, it was found that the effect of the power n is to suppresses the tensor-to-scalar ratio,
which can be used to explore the viability of certain scalar potentials for the inflaton, e.g.
chaotic one, which is ruled out by current data.
In this way, the main goal of the present work is to study the viability of chaotic monomial
potential V (φ) = V0 (φ/Mpl )p within the G-inflation scenario (2) with the following expression
for the Galileon self-interaction
G(φ, X) =

c
M 4n−1

X n.

(3)

The plan of our work is as follows: In the next section we briefly present the dynamics of
Galileon inflation, and we summarize the basic formulas we shall be using. In section III
we apply the general framework presented in previous section to the chaotic potential, then
we discuss our numerical results for the particular cases of chaotic quadratic and quartic
potentials, and we finally summarize our work in the fourth section.

II.

G-INFLATION

In this section we give a brief review on the background dynamics and the cosmological
perturbations in the framework of G-inflation with a power-law Galileon self-coupling.

A.

Background Dynamics

Our starting point, is the action for the Galileon scenario (2) with minimal coupling to
gravity, i.e. f (φ) =

2
Mpl
,
2

S=

which becomes
Z

√

−g



Mpl2
R + K(φ, X) − G(φ, X) φ d4 x .

(4)

Here, g corresponds to the determinant of metric tensor gµν , Mpl is the reduced Planck mass,
R denotes the Ricci scalar and X = −g µν ∂µ φ∂ν φ/2. The scalar field is denoted by φ and
the functions K and G have an arbitrary dependence on X and φ.
By assuming a spatially flat Friedmann-Lemaı̂tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric and
a homogeneous scalar field φ = φ(t), then the modified Friedmann equations can be written
as [35, 36]
3Mpl2 H 2 + K + φ̇2 (Gφ − KX ) − 3HGX φ̇3 = 0,

(5)

and

where H =

(6)

corresponds to Hubble rate and a denotes the scale factor. In the following,

we will consider that the dots denote differentiation with respect to cosmic time and the
notation KX denotes KX = ∂K/∂X, while KXX corresponds to KXX = ∂ 2 K/∂X 2 , and Gφ
means Gφ = ∂G/∂φ, etc.
From variation of the action (4) with respect to the scalar field we have

2

3HGφX φ̇3 + φ̇2 (9H 2 GX − Gφφ + KφX ) − Kφ − 3H φ̇(2Gφ − KX ) = 0.

(7)

In the specific cases in which the functions K = X − V (φ) (with V (φ) being the effective
potential for the scalar field) and G = 0, standard single field inflation in the context of
General Relativity (GR) is recovered.
In order to study the model of G-inflation, for the function K(φ, X) we choose
K(φ, X) = X − V (φ),

(8)

while for the Galileon self-coupling G(φ, X), following Refs.[54–56], we take a generalized
expression
G(φ, X) =

c
M 4n−1

X n,

(9)

where c is a dimensionless constant to be fixed, M is a mass scale, and n is a positive
integer power. The case n = 1 was studied previously in Ref.[52] for chaotic inflation, whose
theoretical predictions were consistent with data available at that time.
Following Ref.[35], we will consider the model of G-inflation under the slow-roll approximation. In this sense, the effective potential dominates over the functions X, |GX H φ̇3 |.
Thus, under this approach, the Friedmann equation given by Eq.(5) can be approximated
to
3Mpl2 H 2 ≃ V (φ).

(10)

In context of slow-roll approximation, we can introduce the set of slow-roll parameters for
G-inflation, defined as [35]
δX =

KX X
,
Mpl2 H 2

δGX =
5

GX φ̇X
,
Mpl2 H

ε1 = −

Ḣ
,
H2

ǫ2 = −

φ̈
= −δφ .
H φ̇

(11)

From the parameters defined above and combining with the Friedmann equations (5) and
(6), the slow-roll parameter ε1 can be rewritten as
ε1 = δX + 3δGX − δφ δGX .

(12)

Now, from the functions K(φ, X) and G(φ, X) given by Eqs.(8) and (9), respectively, and
considering the slow-roll parameters from Eqs.(11) and (12), the equation of motion for the
scalar field is rewritten as
3H φ̇(1 − ǫ2 /3) +

3nc
X n−1 H 2 φ̇2 (3 − ε1 − 2nǫ2 ) = −V,φ .
4n−1
M

(13)

Within the slow-roll analysis, we are going to consider that the slow-roll parameters
|ε1 |, |ǫ2 | ≪ 1, see Ref.[35]. Then, a leading order of slow-roll approximation, the equation of
motion for the scalar field, given by Eq.(13), yields
3H φ̇(1 + A) ≃ −V,φ ,

(14)

where A being a function defined as follows
A≡3

δGX
3cn
= n−1 4n−1 φ̇2n−1 H.
δX
2 M

(15)

By combining Eqs.(10) and (14), the slow-roll parameter δX may bew rewritten as
δX ≃
where ǫ =

is the usual slow-roll parameter for standard inflation. Accordingly,

the slow-roll parameter ε1 now becomes
ε1 = −

ǫ
Ḣ
≃ (1 + A)δX ≃
.
2
H
1+A

(17)

As it can bee seen from Eq.(17), the conventional slow-roll inflation corresponds to the limit
A → 0, in which ε1 ≃ ǫ ≃ δX . For small M, there appears a regime where the Galileon selfinteraction dominates over the standard kinetic during inflation, i.e. A ≫ 1 (δGX ≫ δX ),
and the evolution of φ slows down relative to those in standard inflation.
An important issue is the appearance of ghosts and Laplacian instabilities in the regime
A ≫ 1 (see , e.g. Ref.[57] for an extensive analysis). From Eq.(15), and noting that, during
6

inflation, V,φ > 0 and φ̇ < 0, in order to avoid the appearance of ghosts and Laplacian
instabilities, we demand the condition c φ̇2n−1 > 0 (c = −1). From Eq.(17), the end of
inflation is now determined by
ǫV (φend ) = 1 + A(φend).

(18)

The number of e-folds in the slow-roll approximation we obtain
Z φ∗
V
1
(1 + A)
dφ̃,
N ≃ 2
Mpl φend
V,φ̃

(19)

where φ∗ and φend are the values of the scalar field when the cosmological scales crosses the
Hubble-radius and at the end of inflation, respectively. As it can be seen, the number of
e-folds is enhanced due to an extra term of (1 + A). This implies a more amount of inflation,
between these two values of the field, compared to standard inflation.

B.

Perturbations

In the following, we present a brief review of the basic relations governing the dynamics of
cosmological perturbations in the framework of G-inflation, based mainly on Refs.[35, 58, 59].
Regarding the power spectrum of the primordial scalar perturbations PS , in the slow-roll
approximation it can be written as
1/2

PS ≃

3/2

(20)

cs k=aH

where the functions qs and εS are defined as
qs = Mpl2 (δX + 2δXX + 6δGX + 6δGXX − 2δGφ ) ,

(21)

and
εS = δX + 4δGX − 2δGφ , where δXX =

KXX X 2

Mpl2 H 2

and δGXX =

(22)

Here, c2s is the propagation speed of a scalar mode squared, which is defined through the
relation
c2s =

In this form, by assuming the explicit form of functions K and G, given respectively by
Eqs.(8) and (9), it is found that the functions qs and εS are rewritten as

qs = 2 (1 + 2nA) , and εS = 2 2 1 + A .

(24)

From Eq.(20) and considering functions already defined above, the scalar power spectrum
in the slow-roll approximation results
PS ≃

8π 2 Mpl2 δX (1 + 4A/3)3/2
12π 2 Mpl6 Vφ2 (1 + 4A/3)3/2

(25)

and the scalar propagation speed squared becomes
c2s =

1 + 4A/3
≤ 1.
1 + 2nA

(26)

In particular, in the limit A ≫ 1, c2s reduces to
c2s ≃

2
,
3n

(27)

where the power n is such that n ≥ 2/3. Then, the background dynamics evolves such that
Eqs.(24) and (26) yield qs > 0 and c2s > 0, avoiding Laplacian instabilities and ghosts.

In the limit A ≫ 1, the scalar power spectrum, given by Eq.(25), becomes approximately

Also, the scalar spectral index nS associated with the tilt of the power spectrum, characterizes its scale dependence and it is defined as nS − 1 =

Thus, from Eq. (25)

Eq.(29) coincides with the expression obtained in standard inflation in GR, where nS ≃

Accordingly, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, defined as r = PT /PS , in the framework of Ginflation under slow-roll approximation can be written as

Again, we note that in the limit A → 0, the tensor-to-scalar ratio coincides with the expression obtained in standard inflation, where r ≃ 16ǫ. Now, in the opposite limit, A ≫ 1, the
tensor-to-scalar ratio r is approximated to

Moreover, the expression of above agrees with Ref.[52] for n = 1. With is, Galileon inflation
becomes phenomenologically distinguishable from standard inflation, which enables us to
explore the viability of certain scalar potentials for the inflaton, such as monomial one,
which is ruled out by current data.

III.

G-INFLATION WITH A CHAOTIC POTENTIAL: RESULTS FOR A ≫ 1

For concreteness and comparison with previous works, we are going to study chaotic
inflation, characterized by a potential of the form
V (φ) = V0 (φ/Mpl )p

,

(p > 0),

(35)

where V0 and p are real constants and Mpl is the reduced mass Planck. In addition, we
shall consider the presence of the Galileon-like self-interaction given by Eq.(9). In order
to derive analytical expressions for the quantities which describe the background dynamics,
we restrict ourselves to the regime dominated by the Galileon term, A ≫ 1 (M → 0).
Otherwise, the full analysis of the model requires numerical solving of the background as
well as perturbation dynamics.

9

For the background dynamics of our concrete model, it is found that A as a function of
the inflaton fields is given by

(39)

It is worth to mention that Eq.(38) evaluated at n = 1 reduces to those found on Ref.[52].
If the power n of the generalized expression of the Galileon-self coupling has a fixed value,
V0 tends to be larger for smaller M. Now, when the mass scale M is fixed, V0 tends to be
smaller for larger n.
The predicted scalar spectral index (31) and the tensor-to-scalar ratio r (34), both expressed in terms of the number of e-folds N , become

(40)
(41)

Again, these expressions reduced to those obtained in Ref.[52] for n = 1. Before study
some particular cases, we way analyse the effect of the power n on the values for nS and
r. In particular, for larger n, the scalar spectral index tends to

(2+p)N −2(p+1)
,
(2+p)N +p

while the

tensor-to-scalar ratio tends to zero. For concreteness, we shall study the quadratic potential
(p = 2) and the quartic one (p = 4) separately.
10

A.

p=2

In first place, we shall focus on chaotic quadratic inflation (p = 2). Then, nS (40) and
r (41) are certain functions of the number of e-folds N and the power n. In this way, we
plot parametrically r versus nS , by varying N and n simultaneously in a wide range, in the
same plot with the allowed contour plots of the latest Planck data as well the theoretical
predictions for standard chaotic quadratic inflation (yellow line), as is shown in Fig.1. On
the nS − r plane, as n increases for a fixed N the shown curves lead to lower tensor-to-scalar
ratio. Hence, the theoretical prediction lies inside the 95 % C.L. region from Planck 2018
[44] when the power n takes the following values:
• For N = 50,
n & 8.

(42)

n & 4.

(43)

n & 5.

(44)

• For N = 60,

• For N = 70,

As it can be seen from Fig.1, for n = 1 the tensor to-scalar ratio becomes slowly decreased
in comparison to the standard scenario, e.g., for N = 60 we have that r ≃ 0.115, which
agrees with Ref.[52]. Nevertheless, this former result was supported by last data of WMAP
[20], the current available data at that time. Otherwise, for n ≃ 4, the scalar spectral index
and tensor-to-scalar ratio becomes nS ≃ 0.968 and r ≃ 0.07 at N = 60, being supported by
current bounds of latest Planck data.
Considering that the lower bound on n for N = 60 is n ≃ 4, Eq.(36), leads to the
following relation
A ≃ 3.23 × 10

−10

Mpl

(45)

which means that, in order to be within the regime A ≫ 1, the mass scale is such that M ≪

1.42 × 10−3 Mpl . Accordingly, the Planck normalization (38) yields V0 ≫ 8.49 × 10−12 Mpl4 .

Now, From the expression for the inflaton potential (35), if we identifying V0 ∼ m2 Mpl2 , the
former constraint on V0 translates into a lower bound for the mass of the inflaton given by

m ≫ 2.91 × 10−6 Mpl2 . In this context, the mass for the inflaton field can be even larger than
those predicted in standard inflation.

B.

p=4

Now, we turn on the theoretical predictions for the particular case of chaotic quartic
inflation (p = 4). In similar fashion as we did for the chaotic quadratic potential, we plot
parametrically r (41) versus nS (40), by varying N and n simultaneously in a wide range, in
the same plot with the allowed contour plots of the latest Planck data, as is shown in Fig.2.
In this case , the theoretical prediction of standard chaotic quartic inflation is not shown
explicitly, since the value of the tensor-to-scalar ratio r is well outside the range constrained
by Planck 2018 data. As it can be seen from Fig.2, as the power n increases for a fixed N ,
the shown curves lead to lower tensor-to-scalar ratio. Moreover, the curve for N = 50 is
always outside the 95 % C.L. region for any value of n. Otherwise, for N = 60 and N = 70,
the theoretical predictions enter to the 95 % C.L. region from Planck 2018 when the power
n takes the following values:

FIG. 2: Allowed contours at the 68 and 95 % C.L., from the latest Planck data [44] and theoretical
predictions in the nS − r plane for chaotic quartic inflation (p = 2) in our model (green-shadow
region).

For a sake of comparison, the tensor-to-scalar ratio for n = 1 at N = 60 is r ≃ 0.164,
which agrees with those found in Ref.[52], being also supported by current observational
data at that time [20], but incompatible with current Planck data. Recall that, in order to
be in agreement with the current upper bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, the power n
of the Galileon coupling must satisfy the lower bound n & 9, for N = 60. Particularly, for
n ≃ 9, the scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio becomes nS ≃ 0.962 and r ≃ 0.06,
being supported by current bounds of latest Planck data.
With regard to the consistency of the dynamics evolving according to the Galileon dominated regime A ≫ 1, from Eq.(36) it is found that the mass scale M for N = 60 satisfies

M ≪ 1.61 × 10−3 Mpl . On the other hand, by identifying V0 ∼ λ Mpl4 , Planck normalization
(38) and the lower limit for M set a lower bound for λ, yielding λ ≫ 3.67 × 10−15 . Hence,
13

the prediction for the coupling λ within standard inflation becomes smaller than those we
already found in our generalized Galileon scenario.

C.

The issue of instabilities when A ≫ 1

As we have seen, for both chaotic quadratic and quartic potential, the tensor-to-scalar
ratio r gets smaller, yielding that the theoretical curves lie inside the 95% C.L. as well as 68%
C.L. observational contours. Nevertheless, if the Galileon self-interaction is still dominating
over the standard kinetic term after the end of inflation, the coherent oscillations of the
inflaton field are spoiled [52]. Roughly speaking, φ̇ passes from φ̇ > 0 to φ̇ < 0 , which
translates into a negative propagation speed squared of a scalar mode, c2s < 0, leading in
turn to the instability of small-scale perturbations.
A possible way out of the issue of above is to study the dynamics of our scenario in
a full regime, without any approximation. As a first approach, we solve numerically the
full background equations of motion (5), (6), and (7) from inflation up to the oscillatory
regime. We restrict ourselves to the case p = 2, and as a first approach, the parameter
values characterizing the model are assumed that do not differ from those already obtained
in the regime A ≫ 1.
The numerical procedure is summarized as follows: we rewrite Eqs.(5), (6), and (7) in
terms of the the number of e-folds N, which relates to the Hubble rate H through dN = Hdt.
Recall that Eqs.(5), (6), and (7) are not independent, hence me may solve a system of two
coupled differential equations for φ(N) and H(N). Considering that slow-roll is an attractor,
the initial conditions for φ, φ̇, and H can be derived from the slow-roll equations themselves.
Then, after solving for φ(N) and H(N), we compute the slow-roll parameter ε1 , the scalar
propagation speed squared c2s as well as the function qs . In order to get 60 e-folds of inflation
and the behaviour of the solutions shown in Figs.(3) and (4), we choose the following set of
values for the specific chaotic quadratic potential (p = 2) model:
n = 4,

M = 1.1 × 10−3 Mpl ,

V0 = 2.02 × 10−11 Mpl .

(48)

The upper plot of Fig.(3) shows the evolution of inflaton field for the last 5 e-folds of
inflation and the subsequent oscillatory stage. As it can seen, the transition from inflation
and the time when damped oscillations take place is almost instantaneous. In practice, the

and at the end of inflation it becomes equal to one at N = 60. Shorty after the end of
inflation takes place the kinetic epoch and then, ε1 becomes to oscillate during around one
e-fold before the numerical computation stop. Since there is no coupling of the inflaton to
other matter components, e.g. a radiation fluid, ε1 will oscillate and does not stabilize to a

FIG. 4: Upper and lower plot depict the evolution of the scalar propagation speed squared c2s and
the function qs during inflation as well as during the oscillatory stage, respectively.

The behaviour of the scalar propagation speed squared c2s during inflation as well as
during the oscillatory stage is shown in upper plot of Fig.(4). In the same plot we compare
the full expression for c2s (blue line) with those obtained under the slow-roll approximation
within the regime A ≫ 1, c2s = 1/6 (by evaluating Eq.(27) at n = 4). As it can be seen,

the full expression for c2s remains constant and positive during the whole inflationary stage,

then right after inflation it is suppressed and then rapidly becomes equal to one, and stars
to oscillate during around one e-fold before the computation stops. In addition, lower plot
16

shows how the function qs evolves during inflation as well as during the oscillatory phase.
In particular, qs increases during the last e-folds of inflation, reaching a maximum value
shortly after the end of inflation and then starts to oscillate, always taking positive values.
In this way, we find that the inflaton oscillates if the mass scale is such that
M & 1.1 × 10−3 Mpl ,

(49)

which in turn provides that the conditions c2s > 0 and qs > 0 are satisfied during and after
inflation. It is worth mentioning that the above results is within the range obtained for
chaotic quadratic inflation for n = 1 in Ref.[52]. At this point we would like to stress that
previous analysis is intended to be a first approach to overcome the issue of instabilities. In
this direction, a further numerical treatment of background as well as perturbative dynamics
is beyond the scope of the present work.

CONCLUSIONS

To summarize, in the present work we studied the viability of chaotic potentials within
G-inflation scenario, where the Galileon self-coupling has a power-law form G(φ, X) =
c
X n,
M 4n−1

with M and n being a mass scale and a positive integer power and M, respec-

tively. Firstly, we developed the theoretical framework of potential driven inflation with this
generalized Galileon self-coupling at background as well as perturbative levels under the
slow-roll approximation. In particular, we derive the expression for the observables as the
scalar power spectrum, scalar spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio. Interestingly, it
was found that in the regime where the Galileon term dominates over the standard kinetic
√
term A ≫ 1, the tensor-to-scalar ratio becomes significantly suppressed by a factor ∼ n A
in comparison to the standard expression in GR. This distinguishability, at phenomenological level, enabled us the explore the viability of certain scalar potentials for the inflaton,
such as monomial one V (φ) = V0 (φ/Mpl )p , which is ruled out by current data for p ≥ 2.
Accordingly, for this monomial potential, we analysed the effect of the power n on the values
for nS and r. In particular, for larger n, the scalar spectral index tends to

(2+p)N −2(p+1)
,
(2+p)N +p

while the tensor-to-scalar ratio tends to zero. As a specific examples, we studied the cases of
chaotic quadratic (p = 2) and quartic quartic (p = 4). For cases, in order to obtain analytic
expressions for the background quantities and observables as the scalar power spectrum,
17

scalar spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio as functions of the number of e-folds,
we restrict ourselves to the regime where the Galileon term dominates over the standard
kinetic term. For each case, by means the current observational bounds on the inflationary
observables, we found constraints on the power n, the amplitude of the potential V0 , and
the mass scale M which characterizes the Galileon self-coupling. In this way, monomial
potential is bring to be compatible with current observations in this generalized Galileon
scenario for A ≫ 1. However, the issue of instabilities arises if the Galileon term is still
dominating over the standard kinetic term after the end of inflation, leading to a negative
propagation speed squared of a scalar mode, c2s < 0, and subsequently to the instability
of small-scale perturbations. In order to clarify this issue, as first approach, we restrict to
solve numerically the full background equations for the chaotic quadratic (p = 2) potential
and it was found that, in order to avoid the appearance of ghosts and Laplacian instabilities
during the subsequent post-inflationary stage, the mass scale M must satisfy the condition
M & 1.1 × 10−3 Mpl . This ensures the coherent oscillations of the inflaton field during reheating and the transition to standard radiation-dominated era of Hot Big-Bang. In this
direction, a more detailed analysis of the post-inflationary phase should be performed in
order to obtain additional constraints on this class of models, particularly from the duration
of reheating Nre and the reheating temperature Tre . We hope to be able to address this
point in a future work.
