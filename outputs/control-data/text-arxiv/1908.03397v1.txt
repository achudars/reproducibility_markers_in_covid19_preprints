Abstract. We consider non-linear evolution equations arising from mean-field limits
of particle systems on discrete spaces. We investigate a notion of curvature bounds for
these dynamics based on convexity of the free energy along interpolations in a discrete
transportation distance related to the gradient flow structure of the dynamics. This
notion extends the one for linear Markov chain dynamics studied in [21]. We show
that positive curvature bounds entail several functional inequalities controlling the
convergence to equilibrium of the dynamics. We establish explicit curvature bounds
for several examples of mean-field limits of various classical models from statistical
mechanics.

1. Introduction
This work is about long-time behavior for mean-field systems on discrete spaces. Meanfield equations describe the large-scale limit of interacting particle systems where the
total force exerted on any given particle is the average of the forces exerted by all other
particles on the tagged particle. They are used to describe collective behavior in many
areas of sciences. Examples include the modeling of granular flows in physics [2] and
collective behavior and self-organization for groups of animals [16, 11]. We refer to [36]
for an introduction to the mathematical theory.
One of the important questions in the mathematical analysis of these equations is their
long-time behavior. In [9], Carrillo, McCann and Villani obtained quantitative bounds
on the rate of convergence to equilibrium for McKean-Vlasov equations in a continuous
setting of the form
∂t ρ = ∇ · [ρ∇(S ′ (ρ) + V + W ∗ ρ)]
under strong convexity assumptions on the potentials S, V and W . The core idea underlying their method was the fact that the PDE has a gradient flow structure, i.e. it
can be recast as
descent
R a gradient
R
R equation ∂t ρ = −∇F (ρ) of the free energy functional F (ρ) = S(ρ) + V dρ + W ∗ ρ dρ in the space of probability measure with
respect to the Kantorovitch-Wasserstein distance W2 , which has a formal Riemannian
description via Otto calculus [32, 33]. The use of such structures in the study of longtime behavior comes from the fact that as soon as the driving functional satisfies some
uniform convexity property (with respect to the particular metric structure), it must
decay exponentially fast towards its minimal value along solutions of the evolution equation. Moreover, we can use convexity to derive strong functional inequalities relating
the distance, the entropy functional and the entropy dissipation functional [33].

1.1. Setup and main results. Our main motivation here is to adapt the approach
of [9] to mean-field equations in a discrete setting. We consider discrete mean-field
dynamics of the form
µ̇(t) = µ(t)Q(µ(t)) ,
(1.1)
where µ is a flow of probability measures on a finite set X and (Q(µ)xy )x,y∈X is a
parametrized collection of Markov kernels. These dynamics naturally arise as scaling
limits of interacting particles systems on graphs where the interaction only depends on
the normalized empirical measure of the system (which indeed corresponds to mean-field
interactions). They generalize linear Markov chains on discrete spaces, which orrepsond
to the case where Q is a constant Markov kernel, independent of µ.
While the Wasserstein gradient flow approach works well on continuous spaces, it fails
in the discrete setting, since the Wasserstein L2 -transport distance does not admit any
non-trivial absolutely continuous curve. In our previous work [19], we derived a gradient
flow structure for (1.1) by replacing the role of the Wasserstein distance with a distance
W constructed via a suitable modification of the Benamou-Brenier formula for optimal
transport, extending similar earlier results for linear reversible Markov chains obtained
in [29, 31, 13]. Under the condition that the rates Q are Gibbs with a potential K :
with respect to a local
P(X ) × X → R (see Assumption 2.1), i.e. Q(µ) is reversible

Gibbs measure of the form πx (µ) = Z(µ) exp −Hx (µ) , with Hx given in terms of
the potential K, we showed that this dynamic is the gradient flow of the free energy

with respect to the distance W on the simplex of probability measures on X , see Proposition 2.2. This built up on previous works [4, 5] that showed that F is indeed a Lyapunov
functional for the flow. An archetypical example, which we shall discuss in some details
later on, is the classical Curie-Weiss model, which corresponds to a mean-field dynamic
on a two-point space. Already this easy model exhibits interesting behavior, such as a
phase transition at an explicit critical value of a temperature parameter.
In the present work, we exploit this gradient flow structure to analize the long-term
behaviour of (1.1) inspired by the approach in [9] by investigating convexity properties
of the free energy along discrete optimal transport paths for a non-linear Markov triple
(X , Q, π) as above. Following the works of Lott, Sturm and Villani [28, 35] for metric
measure spaces and [21, 31] for linear Markov chains, we make the following
Definition 1.1 (Entropic Ricci curvature lower bound). We say that (X , Q, π) has
Ricci curvature bounded below by κ ∈ R (for short Ric(X , Q) ≥ κ) if for any W-geodesic
(µt )t∈[0,1] :
F(µt ) ≤ (1 − t)F(µ0 ) + tF(µ1 ) −

κ

We will show, see Theorem 3.7, that Ricci curvature lower bounds can be characterized
in terms of a discrete Bochner-type inequality by deriving the Hessian of F in the
Riemannian structure W, as well as in terms of the Evolution Variational inequality

Further, we will show that a positive lower bound on the Ricci curvature entails a number
of functional inequalities that control the convergence to equilibrium of the mean-field
systems. These involve a discrete Fisher information functional I : P(X ) → [0, ∞] given

which arises from the dissipation of F along solutions to (1.1) as dt
F(µt ) = −I(µt ). One
of our main results is the following theorem which can be seen as a discrete analog of [9,
Thm. 2.1].

Theorem 1.2. Assume that Ric(X , Q, π) ≥ λ for some λ > 0. Then the following hold:
(i) there exists a unique stationary point π ∗ for the evolution (1.1), it is the unique
minimizer of F. Let F∗ (·) := F(·) − F(π ∗ );
(ii) the modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality with constant λ > 0 holds, i.e. for
all µ ∈ P(X ),

(iii) for any solution (µt )t≥0 to (1.1) we have exponential decay of the free energy:

(iv) the entropy-transport inequality with constant λ > 0 holds, i.e. for all µ ∈ P(X ),

1.2. Examples. We will establish explicit curvature bounds for several examples of (relatively simple) mean-field dynamics, such as the Curie-Weiss model, zero-range mean-field
dynamcis and misanthrope processes. We compute a formula for the second derivative
of entropy along geodesics, and generalize techniques developed in [22, 20] to the present
non-linear situation in order to bound for bounding this second derivative. The nonlinearity of the dynamic gives rise to several extra terms when computing the Hessian of
the free energy functional, which complicates the analysis.
In the case of the Curie–Weiss model, we will show that a positive lower curvature bound
holds down to the critical temperature, see Section 5.1.
Another particular family of dynamic we shall be interested is when the flux of particles
from some site x to a site y is a function of the particle density at site y, that is
f (cy ). In the situation where f is constant, this would correspond to the scaling limit
of independent particles on the complete graph. As in [22, 20], our approach is in some
sense perturbative in nature, and we shall consider rates of the form f (r) = T + g(r),
and show that if g is not too large in some sense, relative to T , then we can derive a rate
of convergence to equilibrium. This is inspired by recent work of Villemonais [39], who
proved that the N particle system has a positive Ollivier-Ricci (or coarse Ricci) curvature
W(µ, π∗ ) ≤

(another notion of curvature, corresponding to a contraction rate for the Markovian
dynamic) independently of the system size, and hence converges to equilibrium in L2
distance, via a uniform estimate on the Poincaré constant of the dynamic. Our approach
has the advantage of yielding rates of convergence in relative entropy via Theorem 1.2,
which is a strictly stronger notion of convergence.
1.3. Connection to the literature. The approach of [9] was later extended to other
potentials [10, 3]. Other approaches developed later include using uniform convergence
estimates for a stochastic particle approximation [12] and coupling arguments [17, 18].
Without convexity, deriving rates of convergence can be quite delicate, since there may
be multiple equilibria [38], unlike what happens for linear diffusions.
Our approach developed here builds on earlier work [29, 31, 13] contructing gradient flow
structures for linear Markov chain dynamics and [21] studying Ricci curvature and its
impact on functional inequalities in this context. It is also related to, but different from
the one developped in [26], which uses convexity of the entropy along a different type
of paths, the so-called entropic interpolations, rather than geodesic paths, to establish
functional inequalities involving relative entropy. In the continuous setting, entropic interpolations are regularizations of geodesics in Wasserstein space, but in the discrete case
it seems that the entorpic interpolations of [26] are related to a gradient flow structure
different from the one of [19] we use here.
Organization. The plan of the paper is as follows. Section 2 introduces the mathematical framework we shall work in. Section 3 introduces the notion of curvature bounds in
our setting, and contains the computation of the Hessian for general dynamics. Section 4
investigates the consequences of Ricci curvature bounds in terms of functional inequalities and convergence to equilibrium for the nonlinear dynamics. Finally, Section 5
investigates curvature bounds for several examples of mean-field dynamics inspired by
classical models of statistical physics.
2. Setup
2.1. Gradient-flow formulation. The main definitions and results from [19] on which
this work will build are collected in this section. The gradient flow structure of (1.1)
is based on the existence of a suitable potential, which is ensured by the following
constraint, which we shall assume to hold throughout the article. We recall that a rate
matrix Q of a Markov chain in the continuous time setting satisfies
∀x 6= y : Qxy ≥ 0

and

Qxx = −

Qxy .

y6=x

Assumption 2.1. Let K : P(X ) × X → R be such that for each x ∈ X , Kx : P(X ) → R
is a twice continuously differentiable. Let {Q(µ) ∈ RX ×X }µ∈P(X ) be a family of rate
matrices that is Gibbs with respect to the potential function K, i.e. for each µ ∈ P(X ),
Q(µ) is the rate matrix of an irreducible, reversible ergodic Markov chain with respect to
the probability measure

x∈X

In particular Q(µ) satisfies the detailed balance condition with respect to π(µ), that is
for all x, y ∈ X
πx (µ)Qxy (µ) = πy (µ)Qyx (µ)
(2.3)
holds. Moreover, we assume that for each x, y ∈ X the map µ 7→ Qxy (µ) is Lipschitz
continuous over P(X ).
We will refer to the triple (X , Q, π) as above for short as a non-linear Markov triple.
The specific form of (2.1) with (2.2) emerges from the detailed balance condition of
an underlying N -particle system, from which the dynamics we are interested arise in
the limit N → ∞ (see [19]). Associated to a non-linear Markov triple (X , Q, π) is the
non-linear master equation
µ̇(t) = µ(t)Q(µ(t)) ,
(2.4)
which is the deterministic evolution equation describing the mean-field limit of the underlying particle system. Based on the above assumption a gradient flow formulation
of (2.4) is established in [19, Proposition 2.13] as we shall briefly recall.
Consider the Onsager operator K[µ] : Tµ∗ P(X ) → Tµ P(X ) given by
K[µ]ψ(x) := −

where Λ(a, b) = 01 a1−s bs ds = log a−log
b is the logarithmic mean. Then the master
equation can be written in gradient flow form using the functional F from (1.2):
dµt
= −K[µt ]DF(µt ) .
(2.5)
dt
In other words, (2.4) is the gradient flow of F with respect to the Riemannian structure
on P(X ) induced by the metric tensor K[µ]−1 . Since this Riemannian metric degenerates
at the boundary of P(X ) we note the following characterization in metric terms. We
consider the distance function on P(X ) that is formally induced by the Riemannian
metric K[µ]−1 , i.e. for µ0 , µ1 ∈ P(X ) we set

W(µ0 , µ1 ) :=

where CE is the set of curves (µt , ψt )t∈[0,1] with t → µt continuous, ψ measurable and
integrable in time, and satisfying the continuity equation
µ̇t = K[µt ]ψt
in distribution sense, and the action functional A is given by

Proposition 2.2 (Gradient flow structure of the mean-field system). Let (X , Q, π) be
a non-linear Markov triple satisfying Assumption 2.1. Then any solution to (2.4) is a
gradient flow of F with respect to the distance W.

6

MATTHIAS ERBAR, MAX FATHI, AND ANDRÉ SCHLICHTING

The distance W and the above gradient flow structure are extensions of the discrete transport distance constructed in [29] and the gradient flow structure of linear Markov chains
to the non-linear case. See [19, Section 2.3] for more background on the construction of
the distance W.
An immediate consequence of the gradient flow formulation (2.5) is the free energy
dissipation relation established in [19, Remark 2.14]:

with Θ : R+ × R+ → R+ defined by Θ(a, b) = (a − b)(log a − log b). In this framework,
the Fisher information can be reinterpreted as the squared modulus of the gradient of
the entropy with respect to the discrete transport metric W, i.e. we have
I(µ) = hDF(µ), K[µ]DF(µ)i .
2.2. Notation. We will use the following notation throughout the paper.
Given a function ψ ∈ RX we will denote by ∇ψ ∈ RX ×X its discrete gradient, given by
∇ψxy = ψy − ψx .
For a function Ψ ∈ RX ×X we denote by ∇ · Ψ its discrete divergence, given by
(∇ · Ψ)x =

Ψxy − Ψyx .

For ψ, φ ∈ RX and Ψ, Φ ∈ RX ×X we will denote the Euclidean inner products by
hψ, φi =

ψx φx ,

hΨ, Φi =

Ψxy Φxy .
2 x,y∈X

Then we have the integration by parts formula
hψ, ∇ · Φi = −h∇ψ, Φi .
For a functions Φ, Ψ in RX ×X , we denote by Φ·Ψ the componentwise
product. Using the


shorthand notation Λ(µ)xy
Λ µx Q(µ)xy , µy Q(µ)yx we can thus write the continuity
equation (2.6) and the action functional (2.7) compactly as


µ̇t + ∇ · Λ(µt ) · ∇ψt = 0 ,

A(µ, ψ) = h∇ψ, Λ(µ) · ∇ψi .

We will switch freely between notations for the components of functions ψ ∈ RX , Ψ ∈
RX ×X as ψx , Ψxy or ψ(x), Ψ(x, y) depending on what is more readable in the presence
of other indices, e.g. a time parameter t.

2.3. Equilibria and qualitative longtime behavior. From the gradient flow formulation, it is straightforward to obtain the following characterization of stationary states,
which is completely analog to the McKean-Vlasov equation on Rn [8, Proposition 2.4
and Corollary 2.5].
Proposition 2.3 (Characterization of stationary points). Let (X , Q, π) be a non-linear
Markov triple satisfying Assumption 2.1. Then, the following statements are equivalent:
(1) π ∗ is a stationary solution to (1.1), that is π ∗ Q(π ∗ ) = 0.
(2) π ∗ is a fixed point of the map µ 7→ π(µ) (2.1), that is π ∗ = π(π ∗ ).
(3) π ∗ is a critical point of F (1.2) on P(X ).
(4) π ∗ is a global minimizer of I (2.9), that is I(µ∗ ) = 0.
The set of all stationary points π ∗ is denoted by Π ∗ .
Moreover, it holds that Π ∗ ⊂ P ∗ (X ), i.e. each stationary point has strictly positive
density.
Proof. (1)⇔(2): Let π ∗ Q(π ∗ ) = 0. The rate matrix Q∗ = Q(π ∗ ) is by assumption the
rate matrix of an irreducible reversible Markov chain with unique reversible measure
π(π ∗ ). In particular, it is also the unique stationary solution to π(π ∗ )Q∗ = 0 and hence
π ∗ = π(π ∗ ). If π ∗ = π(π ∗ ), we calculate using the local detailed balance condition (2.3)
and find

πx (π ∗ )Qxy (π ∗ ) =

πy (π ∗ )Qyx (π ∗ ) = 0 ,

since Q is a rate matrix.
(2)⇔(3): Take µ ∈ P ∗ (X ) and any ν ∈ P(X ). Let µs = (1 − s)µ + sν the standard
linear interpolation. Then, it holds

where we used the relations (2.1) and (2.2). Now, if µ =
= π(π ∗ ) the right hand side
is zero and hence π ∗ a critical point if F. On the other hand, if the right hand side is zero
for all ν ∈ P(X ), it follows that µx = Cπx (µ) for a constant C. Since µ, π(µ) ∈ P ∗ (X ),
we have that C = 1 and hence critical points are fixed points.
(2)⇔(4): Let π ∗ = π ∗ (π). Since I(µ) ≥ 0 for all µ ∈ P(X ), we immediately find
from the local detailed balance condition (2.3) that I(π ∗ ) = 0. Likewise, any global
minimizer π ∗ satisfies by the definition of I that πx∗ Qxy (π ∗ ) = πy∗ Qyx (π ∗ ), that is the
local detailed balance condition (2.3). Since again by assumption Q(π ∗ ) has the unique
reversible measure π(π ∗ ), we conclude that π ∗ = π ∗ (π).
Finally, the positivity follows from the definition of π(µ) in (2.1) and the assumptions
on K implying that H is finite. Hence, π(µ) ∈ P ∗ (X ) for all µ ∈ P(X ) implies in
particular that π(π ∗ ) = π ∗ ∈ P ∗ (X ).

Another useful information provided by the gradient flow information is the free energy
dissipation relation (2.8), which immediately shows that F is a Lyapunov function for the
evolution (1.1). By standard theory, we can conclude the following qualitative longtime
behavior.

8

Proposition 2.4 (Convergence to stationary points). Let Q satisfy Assumption 2.1,
then c(t) → π ∗ for some π ∗ ∈ Π ∗ as t → ∞.
Proof. The proof follows along standard arguments from the theory of dynamical systems
(see for instance [37, Section 6]).
By Assumption 2.1, Q is Lipschitz on P(X ), which implies by standard well-posedness for
ODEs, that the solutions (µt )t≥0 to (1.1) are globally defined and generate a semigroup
on P(X ). The ω-limit is given by
n

o

ω(µ) = ν ∈ P(X ) : µtj → ν for some sequence tj → ∞ .
S

Since P(X ) is compact, each orbit O+ (µ0 ) = t≥0 µt for any µ0 ∈ P(X ) is also compact
in P(X ) and the ω-limit is non-empty and quasi-invariant, that is for ν ∈ ω(µ0 ) it holds
O+ (ν) ⊆ ω(µ0 ). Moreover, again thanks to the compactness of P(X ) follows for any
µ0 ∈ P(X ) that distP(X ) (µt , ω(µ0 )) → 0 as t → ∞ (see also [37, Lemma 6.7]).
Since the free energy functional F is continuous on P(X ) and monotone along the flow,
it follows that ω(µ0 ) consists of complete orbits along which F has the constant value
F ∞ = limt→∞ F(νt ) with ν0 ∈ ω(µ0 ). By the free energy dissipation relation (2.8), it
follows that for any ν0 ∈ ω(µ0 ) and any t > 0 we have
F∞ +

Z

0

t

I(νs ) ds = F ∞

and hence the nonnegativity of I and continuity of trajectories imply I(νs ) = 0 for all s ∈
[0, t]. Hence, ω(µ0 ) consists of all states ν such that I(ν) = 0, which by Proposition 2.3
entails ν ∈ Π ∗ and moreover also that ν is a stationary solution νQ(ν) = 0.

Our purpose in this work can be summarized as giving sufficient conditions for which
the above statement on convergence to equilibrium can be made quantitative (but which
shall automatically enforce that Π ∗ contains a single element).
3. Curvature for non-linear Markov chains
In this section, we introduce a notion Ricci curvature lower bounds for non-linear Markov
chains based on geodesic convexity of the entropy. This generalizes the notion of curvature for linear Markov chains developed in [21] inspired by the approach of Lott, Sturm
and Villani [28, 35] to a synthetic notion of lower bounds on Ricci curvature for geodesic
metric measure spaces.
Let (X , Q, π) be a non-linear Markov chain according to Assumption 2.1 and let F be
the associated free energy functional (1.2) and W the associated transport distance.
Definition 3.1 (Entropic Ricci curvature lower bound). We say that (X , Q, π) has
Ricci curvature bounded below by κ ∈ R (for short Ric(X , Q) ≥ κ) if for any W-geodesic
(µt )t∈[0,1] :
κ
F(µt ) ≤ (1 − t)F(µ0 ) + tF(µ1 ) − t(1 − t)W(µ0 , µ1 )2 .
2
We will show that a lower bound on the Ricci curvature can be characterized equivalently
by a lower bound on the Hessian of the free energy functional F with respect to the
Riemanian structure on P∗ (X ) induced by W, or via an Evolution Variational Inequality
for the non-linear Markov dynamics.

To this end, we first derive the geodesic equation for the distance W as well as an
expression for the first variation of the free energy.
Lemma 3.2 (Geodesic equation). Let (µt )t∈[0,1] be a constant speed geodesic contained
in P∗ (X ). Then the unique potential (ψt )t∈[0,1] such that (µ, ψ) ∈ CE solves

(3.1)

where ∂µ(z) is the derivative with respect to µ(z).

Remark 3.3. In the case of a linear Markov chain, where Q is independent of µ, the
expression (3.1) simplifies to

recovering the geodesic equation derived in [21, Prop. 3.4].

Proof. Since P∗ (X ) is a smooth Riemannian manifold, uniqueness and smoothness of
geodesics imply that the curve µt is smooth, and that there exists a unique (up to
constants) potential ψt such that (µ, ψ) ∈ CE and achieves in the infimum for the action
A(µ, ψ) =

A(µt , ψt ) dt ,

A(µ, ψ) = h∇ψ, Λ(µ) · ∇ψi ,

and moreover ψ is then also a smooth curve. We will derive (3.1) as the corresponding
Euler–Langrange equation. So let µst ∈ P∗ (X ) for s ∈ [−ε, ε] be a smooth perturbation
of µ such that µs0 = µ0 and µs1 = µ1 for all s. Let ψts be the unique potentials such that
(µs· , ψ·s ) ∈ CE. Note that ψts is smooth in s and t. Then we have

and integrated by parts.

To give an expression of the second variation of F, we further introduce the following
notation.
Let ∂µz Q(µ; x, y) denote the partial derivative of Q(·; x, y) with respect to µz . Then we
write
DQ(µ, σ; x, y) :=

M (µ; z, w, x, y) := µx Λ(µ)(z, w) ∂µz Q(µ; x, y) − ∂µw Q(µ; x, y) .

L̂Λ(µ)(x, y) = ∂1 Λ(µ)(x, y)L̂µ µ(x)Q(µ; x, y) + ∂2 Λ(µ)(x, y)L̂µ µ(y)Q(µ; y, x) ,

Remark 3.5. Note that in the case of a linear Markov chain, the last two terms in the
definition of B vanish and we recover the formula of [21] for the second derivative of the
entropy along geodesics.
Lemma 3.6 (Second variation of the free energy). Let (µt )t be a W-geodesic contained
in P∗ (X ) and let (ψt ) be the unique potential such that (µ, ψ) ∈ CE. Then it holds

We can now state the following equivalent characterizations of lower Ricci bounds:
Theorem 3.7. Let κ ∈ R. For a non-linear Markov triple (X , Q, π) the following
assertions are equivalent:
(1) Ric(X , Q, π) ≥ κ ;
(2) For all µ ∈ P∗ (X ) and ψ ∈ RX we have
B(µ, ψ) ≥ κA(µ, ψ) .
(3) The following Evolution Variational Inequality EVIκ holds: for all µ, ν ∈ P(X )
and all t ≥ 0:
1 d+
κ
W(µt , ν)2 + W(µt , ν)2 ≤ F(ν) − F(µt ) ,
EVIκ
2 dt
2
where µt denotes the solution to the non-linear Fokker–Planck equation starting
from µ, i.e. µ̇t = L̂µt µt = µt Q(µt ) and µ0 = µ;
By Lemma 3.6, (2) corresponds to a lower bound κ on the Hessian of F in the Riemannian
structure on P∗ (X ) induced by W. Note that the equivalence of (1) and (2) is a nontrivial assertion, since the Riemannian metric degenerates at the boundary of P(X ).
Proof. The proof is based on an argument of Daneri and Savaré [15] suitably adapted
to the discrete setting. We can follow verbatim the proof of [21, Thm. 4.5] where the
analogue of Thm. 3.7 is proven for linear Markov chains. The core of the argument is
a variation of the action along the evolution equation, [21, Lem. 4.6]. To accommodate
the additional terms arising from the non-linear structure in the present situation, we

have to replace that lemma with Lemma 3.8 below.
Lemma 3.8. Let {µs }s∈[0,1] be a smooth curve in P∗ (X ). For each t ≥ 0, let µst denote
the solution of the non-linear Fokker–Planck equation at time s + t starting from µs and
let {ψts }s∈[0,1] be a smooth curve in RX satisfying the continuity equation
∂s µst + ∇ · (Λ(µst ) · ∇ψts ) = 0 ,

s ∈ [0, 1] .

Then the identity
1
∂t A(µst , ψts ) + ∂s F(µst ) = −sB(µst , ψts )
2

CURVATURE FOR DISCRETE MEAN-FIELD DYNAMICS

13

holds for every s ∈ [0, 1] and t ≥ 0.
Proof. First of all, setting ρst =

µst
π(µst )

we compute as in Lemma 3.4 that

∂s F(µst ) = hlog ρst , ∂s µst i = −hL̂µst µst , ψts i .
Furthermore,
1
1
∂t A(µst , ψts ) = h∂t ∇ψts , Λ(µst )∇ψts i + h∇ψts , ∂t Λ(µst ) · ∇ψts i
2
2
=: I¯1 + I¯2 .
In order to further manipulate I¯1 we first note that
∂t µst = s · L̂µst µst .
Further, we observe that for any φ ∈ RX
h∇φ, Λ(µst ) · ∂t ∇ψts i + h∇φ, ∂t Λ(µst ) · ∇ψts i
= hµst , Lµst φi + sh∂s µst , Lµst φi + shµst , ∂s Lµst φi .

(3.9)

To show (3.9), note that the left-hand side equals ∂t ∂s hµst , φi, while the right-hand side
equals ∂s ∂t hµst , φi. Integrating by parts repeatedly and using (3.9) we obtain
I¯1 = −h∇ψts , ∂t Λ(µst ) · ∇ψts i + hµst , Lµst ψts i + sh∂s µst , Lµst ψts i + shµst , (∂s Lµst )ψts i
= −2I¯2 − ∂s F(µst ) + sh∇ψts , Λ(µst ) · ∇Lµs ψts i + shµst , (∂s Lµs )ψts i

Thus, we arrive at

= − h∇ψts , ∂t Λ(µst ) · ∇ψts i + sh∇ψts , Λ(µst ) · ∇Lµst ψts i + shµst , (∂s Lµst )ψts i .
2
To conclude, it suffices to note that
∂t Λ(µst ) = s · L̂Λ(µst ) + s · RΛ(µst ) ,
further remark that for any φ we have


∂s Lµst φ = DQ(µst , ∂s µst )φ = −DQ µst , ∇ · Λ(µst ) · ∇ψts
and then use again (3.8).

Furthermore, A(µ, ψ) = Λ(µ)(0, 1)(ψ(1) − ψ(0))2 . Thus by Theorem 3.7 we get the
optimal curvature bound κopt by dividing the above identity by Λ(µ)(0, 1) and minimize
in µ. Now, we use the identities

4. Consequences of Ricci bounds
In this section we derive consequences of Ricci curvature lower bounds for non-linear
Markov chains in terms of functional inequalities and the trend to equilibrium for the
dynamics. Throughout this section, let (X , Q, π) be a non-linear Markov triple satisfying
Assumption 2.1.

CURVATURE FOR DISCRETE MEAN-FIELD DYNAMICS

15

We first note the following expansion bound for the transport distance between solutions
to the non-linear Markov dynamics.
Proposition 4.1. Assume that Ric(X , Q) ≥ κ for some κ ∈ R. Then for any two
solutions (µit )t≥0 to the non-linear evolution equation µ̇it = µit Q(µit ), i = 1, 2 we have
W(µ1t , µ2t ) ≤ e−κt W(µ10 , µ20 ) .
In particular, when κ > 0, solutions with different initial data get closer at an exponential
speed.
Proof. This is a consequence of the EVIκ . It follows from [15, Prop. 3.1] applied to the
functional F on the metric space (P(X ), W).

Next we prove some consequences of Ricci bounds in terms of different functional inequalities. These results can be seen as non-linear discrete analogues of classical results
of Bakry and Émery [1] and of Otto and Villani [33]. They extend results that have
been obtained in [21] for linear Markov chains, and are reminiscent of results of Carrillo,
McCann and Villani [9] obtained for McKean–Vlasov equations in a continuous setting.
Let F be the free energy functional associated with (X , Q, π) given by
F(µ) =

X

µx log µx + U (µ),

with

U (µ) =

X

µz Kz (µ),

z∈X

x∈X

and recall that F attains its minimum on P(X ). We set
F∗ (µ) := F(µ) − min F(ν) .
ν∈P(X )

so that min F∗ = 0. Recall that I is the discrete Fisher information, given by
1 X
Θ(µx Qxy (µ), µy Qyx (µ)) ,
Θ(a, b) = (a − b)(log a − log b) ,
I(µ) =
2 x,y∈X
provided µ ∈ P∗ (X ) and I(µ) = +∞ else. Recall that I gives the dissipation of F along
a solution (µt ) to the non-linear Fokker–Planck equation µ̇t = µt Q(µt ). More precisely,
we have
d
F(µt ) = −I(µt ) .
dt
Note further that with ρ = µ/π(µ) we have the expression I(µ) = A(µ, − log ρ). The
next result relates F, I and the transport distance W under a Ricci bound.
Theorem 4.2. Assume that Ric(X , Q, π) ≥ κ for some κ ∈ R. Then the FWI inequality holds with constant κ ∈ R, i.e. for all µ, ν ∈ P(X ),

there is nothing to prove. Denote by µt the solution to µ̇t = µt Q(µt ) with µ0 = µ and
set ρt = µt /π(µt ). Theorem 3.7 yields that EVIκ holds, so in particular for t = 0:

Proof. (i) From Proposition 2.3 we know that the set Π∗ of stationary points is nonempty and that it coincides with the set of local minimizers of F. Assume by contradiction that F has two distinct local minima at points µ0 and µ1 , with F (µ0 ) ≤ F (µ1 ) and
let (µs )s∈[0,1] be a constant speed geodesic connecting µ0 and µ1 . Then we infer from
Ric(X , Q, π) ≥ λ that
λ
s(1 − s)W(µ0 , µ1 )2 .
2
Since µ1 is a local minimum, there is an ǫ > 0 such that F(µ1−ǫ ) ≥ F(µ1 ). This leads
to
λ
F(µ1 ) ≤ F(µ1−ǫ ) ≤ ǫF(µ0 ) + (1 − ǫ)F(µ1 ) − ǫ(1 − ǫ) < F(µ1 ) ,
2
a contradiction. Hence, Π∗ = {π∗ } is a singleton and π∗ is the unique global minimizer
of F.
F(µs ) ≤ (1 − s)F(µ0 ) + sF(µ1 ) −

CURVATURE FOR DISCRETE MEAN-FIELD DYNAMICS

(ii) By Theorem 4.2, we have that FWI(κ) holds. Applying FWI(κ) with µ ∈ P(X )
and ν = π∗ , noting that F∗ (π∗ ) = 0, and using Young’s inequality
1
xy ≤ cx2 + y 2
∀x, y ∈ R, c > 0,
4c
p
with x = W(µ, π∗ ), y = I(µ) and c = λ/2 yields the claim.

(iii) From MLSI(λ) we infer that for a solution (µt )t we have
d
F∗ (µt ) = −I(µt ) ≤ −2λF∗ (µt ) ,
dt
and we obtain (4.2) as a consequence of Gronwall’s lemma.

(iv) It suffices to establish ET(λ) for any µ ∈ P∗ (X ). The inequality for general µ can
then be obtained by approximation, taking into account the continuity of W with respect
to the Euclidean metric on P(X ). So fix µ ∈ P∗ (X ), and let µt be the solution to the
non-linear Fokker–Planck equation starting from µ. From Proposition 2.4 we have that
µt → π∗ as t → ∞ and that
F∗ (µt ) → 0

and

W(µ, µt ) → W(µ, π∗ ) .

(4.3)

The last property follows from the continuity of W with respect to the Euclidean distance.
We now define the function G : R+ → R+ by
G(t) := W(µ, µt ) +
q

r

2
F∗ (µt ) .
λ

Obviously we have G(0) = λ2 F∗ (µ) and by (4.3) we have that G(t) → W(µ, π∗ ) as
t → ∞. Hence it is sufficient to show that G is non-increasing. To this end we show
that its upper right derivative is non-positive. If µt 6= π∗ we deduce from (4.1) that
q
I(µt )
d+

I(µt ) − p

2λF∗ (µt )

where we used MLSI(λ) in the last inequality. If µt = π∗ , then the relation also holds
true, since this implies that µr = π∗ for all r ≥ t.

5. Some examples of curvature bounds
We shall now compute lower bounds on the curvature for several examples of mean-field
dynamics, inspired by classical models of statistical physics.
5.1. Curie-Weiss model. Let us consider the following example also mentioned in [5,
Example 4.2], which is the infinite particle limit of the classical Curie-Weiss model, one
of the simplest examples of Markovian dynamic exhibiting a phase transition. Let us
take X = {0, 1} and define K for β > 0 by
Kx (ν) = Vx + β

X

Wxy νy ,

(x, ν) ∈ X × P(X ),

y∈X

with V ≡ 0, W (0, 0) = 0 = W (1, 1), and W (0, 1) = 1 = W (1, 0). Hence, we have
U (ν) = 2βν0 ν1 .

18

The free energy F(µ) for the Curie-Weiss model is given by

= µ(0) log µ(0) + µ(1) log µ(1) + 2βµ(0)µ(1).

Since µ(0) + µ(1) = 1, we have that the free energy is essentially given by the function
fβ : [0, 1] → R
fβ (u) = u log u + (1 − u) log(1 − u) + 2βu(1 − u)

and fβ′′ (u) =

1
− 4β,
u(1 − u)

Hence, fβ is convex on [0, 1] for β ∈ [0, 1] and non-convex for β > 1.

With this choice, we can estimate the Ricci curvature of the limit with the help of
Lemma 3.9.
Proposition 5.1 (λ-Convexity of Curie-Weiss model with Glauber rates). It holds for
β ∈ [0, 1]
κGlauber = 2(1 − β).
(5.1)
As a consequence of this curvature bound, one can derive the modified logarithmic
Sobolev inequality for the nonlinear dynamic. This inequality could also be derived
from a logarithmic Sobolev inequality for the particle Gibbs sampler of [30] and passing
to the limit in the number of particles. In [26], the mLSI was also derived via convexity
of the entropy, but along a different family of interpolations of probability measures. At
a technical level, the proof of [26] requires differentiating the entropy three times rather
than two, which involves more technical estimates (this is not much of an issue for a twopoint space system like Curie-Weiss, but gets much more complicated for more involved
systems, as the ones we shall see later in this section).

Proof. We set µ(0) = u and µ(1) = 1−u, for which the rates become p(µ) = exp(−β(2u−
1)) = 1/q(u). First, we note that with the notation of Lemma 3.9, we have p′ (µ) =
−2βp(µ) and q ′ (µ) = −2βq(µ).
The expression in the infimum of (3.10) to optimize becomes

u(1 − u)

It will be convenient to do the variable substitution x = 2u − 1. For obtaining the
expression in a compact manner, we introduce two auxiliary functions
g1 (x) := cosh(βx) − x sinh(βx)

and

g2 (x) := sinh(βx) − x cosh(βx).

We then obtain, using the identities up + (1 − u)q = g1 (x), up − (1 − u)q = −g2 (x) and
arctanh(x) = 21 log 1+x
1−x and after some rewriting,

κ(x) = cosh(βx) − βg1 (x) +

(5.2)

g2 (x)
A simple evaluation yields κ(0) = 2(1 − β), where we note βx−arctanh(x)
→ 1 as x → 0.
For the lower bound, we proceed in several steps, we first observe that

cosh(βx) − βg1 (x) = (1 − β) cosh(βx) + βx sinh(βx) ≥ 1 − β .
Now, the claim follows once we have shown
g2 (x)
≥ 1 − x2 .
βx − arctanh(x)

(5.3)

Indeed, the last term in (5.2), combined with the above estimate, is bounded from below
by 1 − (1 − x2 )β ≥ 1 − β, which proves (5.1). To prove (5.3), we do another substitution
and set x = tanh(y). Therefore, the function g2 becomes after transformations by
hyperbolic trigonometric identities
g2 (tanh y) =

sinh(β tanh(y) − y)
.

and we can estimate the left hand side of (5.3) by

observing that cosh(y) ≥ 1 for all y ∈ R and by using the identity 1−tanh2 y = 1/ cosh2 y,
to obtain

5.2. General zero-range/misanthrope processes. In this section, we consider meanfield limits of particle systems with rate matrix of the form
Q(µ; x, y) = p(x, y) c(µx , µy )
These systems generalize usual linear Markov chains encoded in p(x, y) by an additional
dependency of the jump rate on the population density of the departure and arrival site
of the jump. This model, first introduced in [14], incorporates many examples, such
as for instance the zero range process, for which c(µx , µy ) = b(µx ), but also interacting
agent/voter models [39], for which c(µx , µy ) = a(µy ).
Since our method in this section is perturbative in nature, we restrict to the complete
graph as underlying graph, that is p(x, y) = 1 for all x 6= y. In this case the meanfield limit from the N -particle system was derived in [23] and the limit equation was
investigated in [34]. Since positive curvature is know in the case of independent particles
on the complete graph [21], we expect that for c(µx , µy ) = T + c̃(µx , µy ) with bounded
c̃ : P(X ) × P(X ) → [0, ∞), we should also obtain positive entropic curvature for the
nonlinear models when T is sufficiently large.
To have a gradient flow formulation, the chain has to satisfy the local detailed balance
condition (2.3)
πx (µ) c(µx , µy ) = πy (µ) c(µy , µx ) .
(5.4)
For the further analysis, we will focus on the separable case, where for some a, b : [0, 1] →
R+ holds
c(µx , µy ) = b(µx ) a(µy ) .
It is easy to verify that (5.4) is satisfied for
πx (µ) =

1 a(µx )
Z(µ) b(µx )

and

Z(µ) =

X a(µx )

.

i.e. for K given by Kx (µ) = u(µx )/µx .
Example 5.2. There are two subclasses of models of particular interest:
Qxy (µ) = a(µy )

and

Qxy (µ) = b(µx ) .

Both models satisfy the local detailed balance condition (2.3) for
πxa (µ) =

For the first, the interacting agent model from [39] is recovered by setting a(µy ) =
T /d + f (µy ), where d = |X | is the (constant) degree of the complete graph. For these
models, [39] proves a spectral gap via another notion of discrete curvature, but which
is not strong enough to derive the mLSI. In the second case, this dynamic corresponds

to (a scaling limit of) a zero range-process. This type of particle system is commonly
used in statistical physics as a toy model for understanding various large-scale features
of interacting systems (scaling limits, long-time behavior, phase transitions). We refer to [27] for an overview. Long-time behavior of the N -particle system in various
situations was studied for example in [7, 6, 22, 24]. Recently, Hermon and Salez [25] significantly improved on the state of the art using a combination of the Lu-Yau martingale
method and a monotone coupling argument, establishing a modified logarithmic Sobolev
inequality independent of the number of particles for mean-field zero-range processes in
a non-perturbative setting, even in some inhomogeneous situations where the curvature
approach cannot work.
In this separable case, we can prove the following statement.
Theorem 5.3 (Curvature for separable kernels). Assume the rates are separable, given
by
Q(µ; x, y) = b(µx )a(µy ) .
Suppose that
0 < a ≤ a(·) ≤ ā

We will use the following identity for the logarithmic mean
s∂1 Λ(s, t) + t∂2 Λ(s, t) = Λ(s, t) .

(5.11)

To compensate off-diagonal terms, we need the following estimate for the logarithmic
mean [22, Lemma A.2]
r(∂1 Λ(s, t) + ∂2 Λ(s, t)) + Λ(s, t) ≥ Λ(r, s) + Λ(r, t) .

The above basic identities shall be used to estimate the four terms in (3.7), which we
denote by I, II, III and IV in this order of occurrence.

Conclusion: We combine all the estimates of the individual terms in (3.7) from the
rewriting B = I + II + III + IV. There is one small catch. After having applied the first
bound (5.13) to I, we split for λ ∈ (0, 1) the non-negative part I1 into (1 − λ) I1 and
λ I1 , where only to the second term λ I1 the bound (5.14) is applied. The other three
estimates (5.15), (5.16) and (5.17) are applied in a straightforward manner to II, III and
IV, respectively, to arrive at the lower bound

If λ is chosen according to (5.5) and by I1 ≥ 0, we arrive at the bound B(µ, ψ) ≥ κA(µ, ψ)
with κ given in (5.6). The final statement (5.7) follows by simple calculus from the bound
ā ≤ a + Lip a, similar for b̄ ≤ b + Lip b and observing that λ = O(η) in this case.
