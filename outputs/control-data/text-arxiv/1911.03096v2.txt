Anomalous dynamics in which local perturbations spread faster than diffusion are ubiquitously
observed in the long-time behavior of a wide variety of systems. Here, the manner by which such
systems evolve towards their asymptotic superdiffusive behavior is explored using the 1d Lévy walk
of order 1 < β < 2. The approach towards superdiffusion, as captured by the leading correction to
the asymptotic behavior, is shown to remarkably undergo a transition as β crosses the critical value
βc = 3/2. Above βc , this correction scales as |x| ∼ t1/2 , describing simple diffusion. However, below
βc it is instead found to remain superdiffusive, scaling as |x| ∼ t1/(2β−1) . This transition is shown
to be independent of the precise model details and is thus argued to be universal.

Introduction - The Lévy walk has proven to be an
effective instrument for modeling a vast number of phenomena in which transport propagates faster than diffusion. For example, it has been shown to successfully
reproduce the peculiar scaling exhibited by chaotic and
turbulent systems [1, 2], the super-diffusive spreading of
perturbations and associated anomalous transport properties of low-dimensional systems [3–8], the anomalous
tagged particle dynamics observed in disordered media
[9, 10], the spatial evolution of trapped ions and atoms
in optical lattices [11–13] and even the behavior exhibited by living matter [14], on both microscopic [15–17]
and macroscopic scales [18, 19].
In 1d, the Lévy walk describes particles, or “walkers”, whose evolution consists of many random excursions on the infinite line. In each such excursion the
walker draws a random direction, in which it walks for
a random duration u with a fixed velocity of magnitude v [6, 20, 21]. The “walk time” u is drawn from
a heavy-tailed distribution φ (u) whose tail scales as
∝ 1/u1+β for large u, with β called the “order” of the
Lévy walk. The model is well known to exhibit superdiffusive behavior in the regime 1 < β < 2, where
the divergence of all but the zeroth and first moments
of φ (u) profoundly affects the walker’s motion: While
the average walk duration is finite, the second moment’s divergence implies that the walker may persist
in very long excursions [21]. This is manifested in the
probability distribution P (x, t) of finding the walker
inside the space interval (x, x + dx) at time t. For
long times and large distances P (x, t) is dominated by
such long excursions and assumes
the asymptotic form

P0 (x, t) = t−1/β f t−1/β |x| , where f is a known function of the scaling variable t−1/β |x| [21–24]. The asymptotic mean-square displacement

port behavior observed in experiments and numerical
simulations of numerous systems, across a broad range
of scientific disciplines. Yet experimental setups and
numerical simulations alike are inherently confined to
finite laboratories, data sets, computer memory and
graduate program’s duration. Superdiffusive behavior
in general, and a convincing connection to the Lévy
walk model in particular, are consequently hard to establish since the asymptotic limit is difficult to reach in
practice [3, 25–34]. An interesting question which naturally arises in this context is: “How do superdiffusive
systems approach their limiting asymptotic behavior?”.
Namely, “Do superdiffusive dynamics posses any universal features which become visible before the strictly
asymptotic regime is reached?”.
This letter studies the onset of superdiffusion in the
1d Lévy walk of order 1 < β < 2, focusing on the leading correction to the asymptotic probability distribution P0 (x, t), which describes the approach of P (x, t)
towards its asymptotic form. A transition is reported
as β crosses the critical value βc = 3/2. For β > βc ,
the correction scales diffusively as |x| ∝ t1/2 while for
β < βc it is remarkably found to remain super-diffusive,
scaling as |x| ∝ t1/(2β−1) . The leading correction to
the asymptotic MSD similarly undergoes a transition at
β = βc . The transition is shown to depend only on the
tail behavior of φ (u) and is thus argued to be universal.
As such, it should also appear in many of the superdiffusive systems modeled by Lévy walks and could thus be
used to substantially simplify studying their anomalous
properties from finite-time data.
The Model - The 1d Lévy walk of order β describes
“walkers” moving on the infinite line. Their motion consists of many random excursions, all with a fixed velocity magnitude v but each along a random direction and
lasting a random duration u drawn from the distribution

, corre-

[21].

These hallmark results have paved the way for employing the Lévy walk to model the superdiffusive trans-

φ (u) = βtβ0 θ [u − t0 ] u−1−β .

The first line of Eq. (2) describes the walker’s probability to reach x at time t during its initial excursion
while the second describes its probability of arriving to
x at time t following a previous excursion which ended
at position x ± vu at time t − u.
After a Fourier-Laplace transform (see Sec. I of the
SM), Eq. (2) for P (x, t) becomes

β, alongside the corresponding asymptotic scaling regimes,
for v = t0 = 1. For β > 2 the Lévy walk effectively reduces
to Brownian motion, as depicted by the green trajectory
for β1 = 3 which is contained within the diffusive scaling
regime t = x2 (magenta). The black trajectory for β2 =
5/3, contained within the superdiffusive scaling regime t =
|x|5/3 (yellow), consists of “mostly diffusive” motion that is
occasionally interrupted by long bouts of ballistic motion.
These ballistic bouts become more frequent, pronounced and
erratic in the red trajectory for β3 = 4/3, confined to the
superdiffusive scaling regime t = |x|4/3 .

Figure 1 demonstrates a single Lévy walk trajectory
for different values of β, qualitatively illustrating the
difference between simple Brownian motion and the superdiffusive Lévy walk. For β > 2, both the first and
second moments of φ (u) are finite and the Lévy walk
effectively reduces to Brownian motion [21, 22]. For
1 < β < 2, which corresponds to the superdiffusive
regime considered in this letter, the average walk time
remains finite but the second moment diverges, occasionally giving rise to very long excursions which grow
increasingly more probable as β → 1. We hereafter
restrict our discussion to the superdiffusive regime of
1 < β < 2.
The probability of finding the walker inside the interval (x, x + dx) at time t for an initial condition

as |k| ∝ t−1/2 while for β < βc it remains superdiffusive, scaling as |k| ∝ t−1/(2β−1) . The transition is

is thus argued to be universal. The leading correction

procedure are provided in Sec. VI of the SM.
Asymptotic Analysis - To obtain the leading correction to the asymptotic probability distribution, our
strategy will be to study P̃ (k, s) in the following order of limits: We first retrieve the leading behavior of
P̃ (k, s) for small s (i.e. large t), then take the inverse
Laplace transform

tion to P̂0 t |k|

with t |k| kept constant. It will prove convenient to
transform to the dimensionless variables

where `0 = t0 v denotes the typical length-scale of the
model. As demonstrated in Sec. III of the SM, only the
leading term in the expansion of ψ̃ (σ − iq) + ψ̃ (σ + iq)
of Eq. (4) in small σ and |q| enters the leading correction. This agrees with intuition, as ψ (t) in Eq. (2) for
P (x, t) describes the walker’s probability of arriving to
x at time t during its initial excursion. This process
naturally becomes irrelevant in the scaling limit, as |x|
and t grow larger.
We next consider the small-σ behavior of φ̃ (σ ∓ iq),
which appears in the denominator of Eq. (4). Expanding the Laplace transform to first order in σ yields

Universality of βc - We next argue that the transition
at βc = 3/2 is universal by deriving it from a general
walk-time distribution whose tail has the form ∼ u−1−β .
To this end, recall that in Eq. (12) we found that the
large-time properties of P̂ (k, t) are determined by I (q).
As such, we turn our attention to it. Since the duration of a walk cannot be negative, φ (u) must vanish
for u < 0. Thus, the integration range in hcos [qu]iu
and hsin [qu]iu of Eq. (14) can be safely extended to
u ∈ (−∞, +∞), allowing I (q) to be rewritten as

h
i
h
i
I (q) = 1 − Re φ̂ (q) /∂q Im φ̂ (q) ,
(19)
R∞
where φ̂ (±q) = −∞ duφ (u) e∓iqu is the characteristic
function of φ (u), whose Hermitian property φ̂ (−q) =
∗
φ̂ (q) was used to obtain Eq. (19).
The ground is now set to hold a more general discussion on the structure of I (q): Since φ (u) is one-sided,
it is non-symmetric and so its Fourier transform φ̂ (q)
contains both real and imaginary terms. Now, had all
of the moments of φ (u) been finite, φ̂ (q) would have
been an analytic function whose nth power-series coefn
ficient in q would simply be ∝ (i) hun iu . However, due
to its heavy tail, the moments of φ (u) are not all finite
and so additional non-analytic terms must also show
up in φ̂ (q). It is straightforward to show that a heavy

5

tail ∼ u−1−β in φ (u) does indeed result in real and
β
imaginary non-analytic terms in φ̂ (q) which are ∝ |q| .
Therefor, φ̂ (q) must be the sum of two parts: The first
being an analytic power-series in q while the second conβ
tains non-analytic
h
i termsh∝ |q|i . We thus write φ̂ (q) as

Equation (21) has the same structure as in Eqs. (14)
and (15) and must therefor also lead to a transition at
βc = 3/2. We call this transition universal since, as we
have just shown, it can be derived under fairly general
considerations, namely that the tail of φ (u) has the form
∼ u−1−β . The characteristic function φ̂ (q) is explicitly
computed in Sec. IV of the SM, showing it is indeed
of the same form as in Eq. (20). I (q) is computed for
a different walk-time distribution, which shares only its
heavy tail ∼ u−1−β with φ (u), and the same transition
is recovered at βc = 3/2 in section V of the SM.
Conclusions - In this letter, the approach of the probability distribution of a superdiffusive system towards
its asymptotic form was studied using the Lévy walk of
order 1 < β < 2. This approach, described by the leading correction to the asymptotic distribution, was shown
to undergo a transition at the critical value βc = 3/2,
at which its scaling remarkably changes from diffusive

to superdiffusive. The leading correction to the asymptotic MSD also undergoes a transition at the same βc .
The transition was argued to be universal as it depends
only on the tail behavior of the walk time distribution.
These results are especially useful since they can readily be applied to study the many superdiffusive systems
modeled by Levy walks, whose finite-time corrections
are often unavoidable and devastating. Such corrections
are known to pose a significant challenge in the study
of anomalous heat transport [3, 6–8, 24, 35, 36]. For example, the Lévy walk of order β = 5/3 was used in [3] to
model the leading asymptotic superdiffusive spreading
of energy perturbations and entailing anomalous transport of a 1d Hamiltonian system. Yet the connection
between anomalous transport and Lévy walks is suggested to extend to an entire class of similar models [3].
Indeed, a diffusive correction to the asymptotic anomalous energy spreading and heat current have recently
been reported in a stochastic 1d gas system [36]. A
diffusive correction to the current was similarly derived
under nonequilibrium settings for the 1d Lévy walk of
order β > 3/2 in [8]. Both of these results are consistent
with the findings reported in this letter. It would thus
be of great interest to further test these results in additional experimental and numerical superdiffusive setups,
especially ones modeled by Lévy walks with β < βc .
It would also be very interesting to study the onset of
superdiffusion in the related Lévy flight model where
particles draw a “flight distance”, rather than a walk
time, immediately materializing at their new location
[21, 37, 38].

FOURIER-LAPLACE TRANSFORM OF EQ.
(2)

This section outlines the derivation of the FourierLaplace transformed probability distribution P̃ (k, s) in
Eq. (4) of the main text. We start from the main text
Eq. (2) for the walker’s position probability distribution, P (x, t). Taking first
R ∞a Fourier transform of the
equation, using P̂ (k, t) = −∞ dxeikx P (x, t), we obtain

THE TRUNCATED MSD

In this section the theoretical expressions for the truncated mean-square displacement (MSD) are compared
to the results of direct numerical simulations of the Lévy
walk model for β = 4/3 and for β = 5/3. As shown in
the main text Eqs. (7) and (8), at large times the MSD
is given by

and |q| (i.e. large times and distances), which appears
in the numerator of the main text Eq. (4), contributes
to the leading correction to the distribution. As in the
calculation of φ̃ (σ ± iq) of the main text Eq. (10), we
shall first expand in small σ (i.e. large t), neglecting

Replacing the numerator ψ̃ (σ − iq)+ ψ̃ (σ + iq) by its
leading correction m, as done in deriving the main text
Eq. (11), is justified at ∼ O (σ) and for small |q| if the
leading terms in the expansion of P̃ (q, σ) is independent
of all of the other coefficients in Eq. (29) (i.e. the coefficients denoted by lower-case letters). A straightforward
calculation verifies that this is true.

THE STRUCTURE OF φ̂ (q)

In this section we compute the characteristic function

φ̂ (q) of the walk time distribution φ (u) = βtβ0 θ[u−t
u1+β
of the main text Eq. (1) and show it has the same
form recovered in the main text Eq. (20) for a general distribution with the same tail behavior. By definition, the characteristic function φ̂ (q) is given by
R∞
φ̂ (q) = −∞ duφ (u) e−iqu . Carrying out the integration yields
φ̂ (q) = f (q; β) − i

and Γ [x] is the Gamma function. Thus, as argued in the

due to the heavy tail of φ (u).

the steps leading to the Fourier transformed probability
distribution in the main text for long times and large
distances, i.e.

X (t)
which appear in the main text figures. In
sim
each realization the walker
 was initialized at the origin
of the interval − L2 , + L2 with a velocity of magnitude
v pointing towards a random direction ±1 and a walk
time u drawn from the walk time distribution φ (u) of
the main text Eq. (1) with cutoff time t0 . The Lévy
walk dynamics were then run up to time T = 0.45 (L/v),
chosen this way to ensure to ensure that the walker does
not escape the interval. The interval was divided into

10

bins of size ∆x such that L/∆x was an integer number. At each time interval ∆t the walker’s position X (t)
was mapped into the appropriate bin, whose centers are
at xm = m − 12 ∆x − L2 , where m = 1,
 2, ..., L/∆x.
By repeating this procedure for ∼ O 106 realizations,
a histogram for the probability P (xm , tn ) of finding
the walker inside bin xm at time tn = n∆t was ob-

tained, where n = 1, 2, ..., N with N = ∆t
