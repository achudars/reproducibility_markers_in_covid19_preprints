Abstract. A projective variety X ⊂ PN is h-identifiable if the generic element
in its h-secant variety uniquely determines h points on X. In this paper we
propose an entirely new approach to study identifiability, connecting it to
the notion of secant defect. In this way we are able to improve all known
bounds on identifiability. In particular we give optimal bounds for some Segre
and Segre-Veronese varieties and provide the first identifiability statements for
Grassmann varieties.

Introduction
The notion of identifiability is ubiquitous both in applied and classical algebraic
geometry. In general we say that an element p of a projective space PN is hidentifiable via a variety X if there is a unique way to write p as linear combination
of h elements of X. In the classical setting this very often translates into rationality
problems and it is linked to the existence of birational parameterizations. In the
applied set up one usually considers a tensor space and the identifiability allows to
reconstruct a tensor via a subset of special tensors defined by rank conditions or
other special requirements. For applications ranging from biology to Blind Signal
Separation, data compression algorithms, and analysis of mixture models, [DDL1]
[DDL2] [DDL3] [KADL] [Si], uniqueness of decompositions allows to solve the problem once a solution is determined. For all these reasons it is interesting and often
crucial to understand identifiability.
Over a decade ago the notion of h-weakly defective varieties has been connected
to identifiability of polynomials, [Me]. This provided the first systematic study of
identifiability for Veronese varieties. More recently with the work of Luca Chiantini
and Giorgio Ottaviani, [CO], weakly defective varieties have been substituted by
h-tangentially weakly defective varieties to study identifiability problems. In both
approaches to provide identifiability one has to check the behavior of special linear
systems and quite often this is done by an ad hoc degeneration argument. As a
consequence identifiability has been proved in very few cases and quite often the
result obtained are not expected to be sharp, [CO] [BDdG] [BC] [BCO] [Kr].
In this paper we want to develop an entirely new approach to study generic
identifiability, see Definition 6 for the precise set up. Starting from the seminal
paper [CC10], where the geometry of contact loci has been carefully studied, and
the improvement presented in [BBC], we derive identifiability statements for non
secant defective varieties. Even if new this is not really surprising since weakly defectiveness and tangentially weakly defectiveness, thanks to Terracini Lemma, have
secant defectiveness as a common ancestor. With this new approach we are able
to translate all the literature on defective varieties into identifiability statements,
providing in many cases sharp classification of h-identifiability. One of the results

we prove in this direction is the following conditional relation between identifiability
and defectivity, we refer to section 1 for the necessary definitions.
Theorem. Let X ⊂ PN be an irreducible reduced variety. Assume that h > dim X,
X is not (h − 1)-tangentially weakly defective and it is not h-identifiable. Then X
is (h + 1)-defective.
As already mentioned identifiability issues are particularly interesting for tensor
spaces. As a corollary we get the best asymptotic identifiability result so far for
Segre, Segre-Veronese, and Grassmann varieties, that is, tensors and structured
tensors, see section 3. As a sample we state the application to binary tensors.
Theorem. The Segre embedding of n copies of P1 , with n ≥ 5 is h-identifiable for
2n
any h ≤ ⌊ n+1
⌋ − 1.
n

Recall that the generic rank of the Segre embedding of (P1 )n is ⌈ n+1
⌉, therefore
our result shows generic identifiability of all sub-generic binary tensors, qbits if you
2n
like the quantum computing dictionary, in the perfect case, that is when n+1
is an
integer, and all but the last one in general, as predicted by the conjecture posed in
[BC].
The starting point of our analysis was the observation that, in all known examples, when a variety X is not h-identifiable then any element in Sech+1 (X) has
infinitely many decompositions, [CMO] [BBC] [BCO] [BV] [COV1]. Going back
to the ideas in [Me] we realized that the best way to use this observation is to
set a connection between the abstract secant map and the tangential projection.
Via this we reduce the problem to study fiber type tangential projections. The
latter is accomplished via the construction of a map from the Hilbert scheme of
points of the contact loci of h-tangentially weakly defective varieties to a suitable
Grassmannian. Under the right assumptions this is proved to be of fiber type and
it allows us to connect defectivity and non identifiability. This, together with an
improvement of the contact loci geometry studied in [CC10] and [BBC], lead us to
derive identifiability from non defectivity under very mild hypothesis.

Theorem. Let X ⊂ PN be a smooth variety. Assume that πkX : Seck (X) → PN is
generically finite and k > 2 dim X. Then X is (k − 1)-identifiable.
The paper is structured as follows. In section 2 we study the geometry of contact
locus and prove the main general results about the connections between defectivity
and non identifiability. In the final section we apply our techniques to varieties that
are meaningful for tensor decomposition and streamline our argument for those.
We are much indebted with Luca Chiantini for many conversations on the subject
and for explaining us the connection between tangentially weakly defective varieties
and identifiability when we started to work on the subject.
1. Notation
We work over the complex field. A projective variety X ⊂ PN is non degenerate
if it is not contained in any hyperplane.
Let X ⊂ PN be an irreducible and reduced non degenerate variety. Let X (h) be
the h-th symmetric product of X, that is the variety parameterizing unordered sets
of h points of X. Let UhX ⊂ X (h) be the smooth locus, given by sets of h distinct
points.
Definition 1. A point z ∈ UhX represents a set of h distinct point, say {z1 , . . . , zh }.
We say that a point p ∈ PN is in the span of z, p ∈ hzi, if it is a linear combination
of the zi .

FROM NON DEFECTIVITY TO IDENTIFIABILITY

With this in mind we define
Definition 2. The abstract h-Secant variety is the irreducible and reduced variety
sech (X) := {(z, p) ∈ UhX × PN |p ∈ z} ⊂ X (h) × PN .
Let π : X (h) × PN → PN be the projection onto the second factor. The h-Secant
variety is
Sech (X) := π(sech (X)) ⊂ PN ,
and πhX := π|sech (X) : sech (X) → PN is the h-secant map of X.
The irreducible variety sech (X) has dimension (hn + h − 1). One says that X is
h-defective if
dim Sech (X) < min{dim sech (X), N }.
Remark 3. If X is h-defective then the h-secant map is of fiber type.
Note that a general point in sech (X) is a linear combination of h points of X.
Thanks to the non degeneracy assumption a general point in sech (X) ( PN is not
a linear combination of less points on X.
The tricky part in studying secant varieties is the closure. Many different things
can happen, the h points can group in infinitely near cluster or positive dimensional
intersection can appear. As a matter of facts these special loci are really difficult
to control and the main advantage to use birational geometry is the opportunity to
get rid of them.
Definition 4. Let X ⊂ PN be a non degenerate subvariety. We say that a point
p ∈ PN has rank h with respect to X if p ∈ hzi, for some z ∈ UhX and p 6∈ hz ′ i for
any z ′ ∈ UhX′ , with h′ < h.
Remark 5. With this in mind it is easy to produce examples of limits of rank
h points with different rank. If we let one of the point degenerate to the span of
the others we lower the rank. If we let two points collapse the rank, generically,
increases.
Definition 6. A point p ∈ PN is h-identifiable with respect to X ⊂ PN if p is of
rank h and (πhX )−1 (p) is a single point. The variety X is said to be h-identifiable
if πhX is a birational map, that is the general point of Sech (X) is h-identifiable
It is clear, by the above remark, that when X is h-defective, or more generally
when πhX is of fiber type X is not h-identifiable.
The next ingredient we need to introduce is Terracini Lemma.
Theorem 7 (Terracini Lemma). [CC02] Let X ⊂ PN be an irreducible variety.
Then we have
• for any x1 , . . . , xk ∈ X and z ∈ hx1 , . . . , xk i
hTx1 X, . . . , Txk Xi ⊆ Tz Seck (X),
• there is a dense open set U ⊂ X (k) such that
hTx1 X, . . . , Txk Xi = Tz Seck (X),
for a general point z ∈ hx1 , . . . , xk i with (x1 , . . . , xk ) ∈ U .
Terracini Lemma yields a direct consequence of h-defectiveness. If X is hdefective then the general fiber of πhX has positive dimension. Therefore by Terracini the general hyperplane tangent at h points of X is singular along a positive
dimensional subvariety. This property does not characterize defective varieties.
Definition 8. Let X ⊂ PN be a non degenerate variety. The variety X is said hweakly defective if the general hyperplane singular along h general points is singular
along a positive dimensional subvariety.

There is a direct connection, proven in [CC02], between h-weakly defectiveness
and identifiability.
Theorem 9. If X is not h-weakly defective then it is h-identifiable.
The main problem is that it is quite hard in general to verify if a variety is
h-weakly defective.
To overcome this problem the notion of tangentially weakly defective varieties
has been introduced, [CO]. Here we follow the notations of [BBC].
For a subset A = {x1 , . . . , xh } ⊂ X of general points we set
[
MA := h Txi Xi.
i

By Terracini Lemma the space MA is the tangent space to Sech (X) at a general
point in hAi.
Definition 10. The tangential h-contact locus Γh :=: Γ(A) is the closure in X of
the union of all the irreducible components which contain at least one point of A, of
the locus of points of X where MA is tangent to X. We will write γh := dim Γ(A).
We say that X is h-twd (tangentially weakly defective) if γh > 0.
Remark 11. It is clear that if X is h-twd then it is h weakly defective, it is (h+ 1)twd and Γh ⊆ Γh+1 . Using scrolls it is not too difficult to produce explicit examples
of varieties that are h-weakly defective but are not h-twd, see also Remark 19.
For what follows it is useful to introduce also the notion of tangential projection.
Definition 12. Let X ⊂ PN be a variety and A = {x1 , . . . , xh } ⊂ X a set of
general points. The h-tangential projection (from A) of X is
τh : X 99K PM
the linear projection from MA . That is, by Terracini Lemma, the projection from
the tangent space of a general point z ∈ hAi of Sech (X) restricted to X.
2. Relation between twd and defectivity
We start collecting properties of the tangential contact loci that will be useful
for our purpose.
Theorem 13. Let X ⊂ PN be an irreducible, reduced, and non degenerate variety.
Let A ⊂ X be a set of h general points and Γ the associated contact locus. Assume
that Sech−1 (X) ( PN . Then we have:
a) Γ is equidimensional and it is either irreducible (type I) or reduced (type
II) with exactly h irreducible component, each of them containing a single
point of A [CC10, Proposition 3.9],
b) hΓi = Sech (Γ) and Seci (Γ) 6= hΓi for i < h [CC10, Proposition 3.9],
c) for z ∈ hΓi general πhX ((πhX )−1 (z)) ⊂ hΓi, [CC10, Proposition 3.9],
d) if we are in type I γh > γh−1 , [BBC, Lemma 3.5]
e) if γh = γh+1 and Sech+1 (X) is not defective and does not fill up PN we
are in type II, the irreducible components of both contact loci are linearly
independent linear spaces, [BBC, Lemma 3.5],
f) if we are in type I and Sech+1 (X) is not defective and does not fill up PN
then Γh+1 is of type I.
Proof. Points a)–e) are proved in the cited papers under the assumption that
Sech (X) ( PN . Points a)–d) are immediate when Sech (X) = PN and Sech−1 (X) (
PN .

We have only to prove point f). Let A = {x1 , . . . , xh } and B = A ∪ {xh+1 } be
general sets in X. Assume that Γ(B) is of type II. By definition Γ(A) ⊂ Γ(B),
on the other hand by point a) the irreducible component of Γ(B) through x1 does
not contain x2 and therefore it cannot contain Γ(A). This contradiction proves the
claim.

From the point of view of identifiability the notions of weakly defectiveness and
twd behave the same. The following proposition is well known to the experts in
the field but we were not able to found a written version of it.
Proposition 14. [Ch] Let X ⊂ PN be an irreducible, reduced, and non degenerate
variety. Assume that X is not h-twd, then X is h-identifiable.
Proof. Assume that X is not h-identifiable and let z ∈ Sech (X) be a general point.
Let z ∈ hx1 , . . . xh i, for xi general in X. The existence of a different decomposition
yields a new set {y1 , . . . yh } ⊂ X such that z ∈ hy1 , . . . , yh i. Moving the point z in
the linear space hx1 , . . . , xh i yields a positive dimensional contact locus.

Remark 15. We want to stress that h-identifiability is not equivalent to non h-twd.
In [COV2] and [BV] are described examples of Segre and Grassmannian varieties
that are h-identifiable but h-twd.
We aim to study the relation between twd and defectivity. The next lemma is a
first step in this direction.
Lemma 16. Let X ⊂ PN be an irreducible, reduced, and non degenerate variety of
dimension n,
πkX : seck (X) → PN
X

X
is of fiber type.
i) The map πkX is of fiber type if and only if τk−1
ii) Let {x1 , . . . , xk , y1 , y2 } be general points. Then

X
iii) The map (τk−1

Proof. i) By Terracini Lemma πkX is of fiber type if and only if
Tz Seck−1 (X) ∩ Ty X 6= ∅
X
for y ∈ X general. This condition is clearly equivalent to have τk−1
of fiber type.
ii) Assume that X is not k-twd and dim(Γ(x1 , . . . , xk , y1 )∩Γ(x1 , . . . , xk , y2 )) > 0
in a neighborhood of xi . Set

MAi = hTx1 X, . . . , Txk X, Tyi Xi,
the variety X is not k-twd therefore
MA1 ∩ MA2 ) hTx1 X, . . . , Txk Xi.
In particular we have
(MA1 ∩ MA2 ) ∩ Tyi X 6= ∅,
and hence
hTx1 X, . . . , Txk X, Ty1 Xi ∩ Ty2 X 6= ∅.
X

Next we prove a general statement for type II contact loci.
Lemma 17. Let X ⊂ PN be an irreducible, reduced, and non degenerate variety.
Assume that:
a) X is k-twd,
b) X is not (k − 1)-twd
c) the k-contact locus is of type II.
X
Then πk+1
is of fiber type.
Proof. By point i) in Lemma 16 it is enough to prove that τkX is of fiber type. Then
by projection it is enough to prove the latter for k = 2. Let {x1 , x2 , y} ⊂ X be a set
of general points and Γ = Γ(x1 , x2 , y) the contact locus associated to {x1 , x2 , y}.
To conclude the proof it is enough to prove that hTx1 , Tx2 i ∩ Tx X 6= ∅, for x ∈ Γ a
general point.
For a general point p ∈ Γ we set
Γip ⊂ Γ(xi , p)
the irreducible component of the contact locus Γ(xi , p) through p. The contact
locus is of type II, therefore Γip 6∋ x1 , x2 . Note that for a general point x ∈ Γ1p we
have Tx X ⊂ hTx1 X, Tp Xi. Then by semicontinuity for any point w ∈ Γ1p there is a
linear space of dimension n, say Aw ⊆ Tw X, contained in the span.
Set
T(Γ1p ) = hAw iw∈Γ1p .
We may assume that X is not 2-defective, otherwise there is nothing to prove, that
is
(1)
Tx1 X ∩ Tx2 X = ∅,
and, since y is general,
codimT(Γ1y ) (T(Γ1y ) ∩ Tx1 X) = n + 1.

(2)

The variety X is not 1-twd, then there are points z ∈ Γ1y with Az ∩ Tx1 X 6= ∅. Let
z ∈ Γ1y be a point with
(3)
Az ∩ Tx1 X 6= ∅,
The contact locus is of type II, therefore z 6= x1 . We want to stress that this is the
only point in the proof where we use the assumption that Γ is of type II.
If Az ∩ Tx2 X 6= ∅, by Equations (1) and (2) we have
codimT(Γ1y ) (T(Γ1y ) ∩ hTx1 , Tx2 i) ≤ n
and we conclude Ty X ∩ hTx1 , Tx2 i 6= ∅, that is τ2X is of fiber type.
Assume that Az ∩ Tx2 X = ∅. Then we consider the span hAz , Tx2 i. By semicontinuity to this linear space is associated a contact locus and we set Γ2z its irreducible
component passing through z. As before we have
codimT(Γ2z ) (T(Γ2z ) ∩ Tx2 ) = n + 1,
and by Equations (1) and (3) we conclude that
codimT(Γ2z ) (T(Γ2z ) ∩ hTx1 , Tx2 i) ≤ n.
This yields
(4)
Aw ∩ hTx1 , Tx2 i 6= ∅,
for any point w ∈
We have z 6= y1 , then the general choice of the points xi ,
and the assumption that X is not 2-defective ensure that
Γ2z .

Aw ∩ Tx1 X = ∅
for general w ∈

Γ2z .

(5)

We set Γ1w the irreducible component through w of the contact locus associated
to hAw , Tx1 Xi. Again z 6= x1 and the general choice of the xi ensure that z 6∈ Γ1w .
In particular
Γ1w 6= Γ2z .
Set
[

S 2 :=

v∈Γ1y general

Then

Γ2z

is in the closure of S and, for p ∈ Γ1y general, Γ1y is in the closure of

w∈Γ2p general

Hence Γ1y is in the closure of
[

S 1 :=

Γ1w .

w∈Γ2z general
1

In particular the general point of S is a general point of X. By construction we
have
codimT(Γ1w ) (T(Γ1w ) ∩ Tx1 X) ≤ n + 1.
Equations (4) and (5) then give
codimT(Γ1w ) (T(Γ1w ) ∩ hTx1 , Tx2 )i ≤ n
and this concludes the proof.



We are ready to prove our main result that connects twd and defectivity.
Theorem 18. Let X ⊂ PN be an irreducible, reduced, and non degenerate variety
of dimension n. Assume that:
a) X is k-twd,
b) X is not (k − 1)-twd
c) k > n and N ≥ (k + 1)(n + 1) − 1.
X
is of fiber type.
Then πk+1
Proof. Thanks to Lemma 17 we may assume that the contact locus is of type I. By
hypothesis the variety X is k-twd. Let A = {x1 , . . . , xk } ⊂ X be a set of general
points and Γ := Γ(A) the associated contact locus of dimension γ > 0. Let z ∈ hAi
be a general point, τk := τkX : X 99K PM the associated k-tangential projection,
and y ∈ X a general point. For a general set Y := {y1 , . . . , yk−1 } ⊂ Γ let Γ(Y ∪{y})
be the contact locus associated to {y1 , . . . , yk , y}.
X
Assume that πk+1
is not of fiber type. then, by i) in Lemma 16 τk is not of fiber
type and by point iii) in Lemma 16, τk (Γ(Y ∪ {y}) is a linear space of dimension γ
through z := τk (y). This gives a map
χ : Hilbk−1 (Γ) 99K G(γ − 1, M − 1).
The point z is smooth hence all these linear spaces sit in Tz τk (X) ∼
= Pn . In
other words we have a map
χ : Hilbk−1 (Γ) 99K G(γ − 1, n − 1) ⊂ G(γ − 1, M − 1).
Note that dim G(γ − 1, n − 1) = γ(n − γ) and dim Hilbk−1 (Γ) = (k − 1)γ. By
hypothesis k > n and γ > 0 hence we have
(k − 1)γ > γ(n − γ).
Then the map χ is of fiber type and fibers have, at least, dimension γ(k − n+ γ − 1).

Set [Y1 ], [Y2 ] ∈ χ−1 ([Λ]) general points, for [Λ] ∈ χ(Hilbk−1 (Γ)) ⊂ G(γ − 1, n− 1)
X
a general point. The variety X is not (k − 1)-twd and we are assuming that πk+1
is not of fiber type therefore, by ii) in Lemma 16,
dim(Γ ∩ Γ(Yi ∪ {y})) = 0,
in a neighborhood of yi . Since the fiber of χ is positive dimensional we have
Γ(Y1 ∪ {y}) 6⊃ Y2 .

(6)

The contact loci are irreducible then, by Equation (6), we conclude that
Γ(Y1 ∪ {y}) 6= Γ(Y2 ∪ {y}).
Therefore, by point iii) in Lemma 16, the positive dimensional fiber of χ induces a
positive dimensional fiber of τk and we derive, by point i) Lemma 16, the contraX
diction that that πk+1
is of fiber type.

Remark 19. Both assumption b) and c) alone are reasonable and not overdemanding. Unfortunately the combination of them is quite restrictive and narrows
the range of application we are aiming at.
We believe the statement is not optimal with respect to assumption c). But we
are not sure it is true, in full generality, without any assumption of this kind. On
the other hand we strongly believe that for many interesting varieties, like Segre,
Grassmannian, Veronese and their combinations, twd can occur only one step before
the secant map becomes of fiber type. This is not the case for weakly defectiveness
as is shown in [BV]. In [BV, Theorem 1.1 a)] it is proven that G(2, 7) is 2 and 3
weakly defective without being 3-defective. Note that this variety is 3-twd and it
is not 2-twd.
The next result generalizes the main result in [BBC] and it allows to avoid the
bottleneck introduced by conditions b) and c) of Theorem 18 in many interesting
situations.
Lemma 20. Let X ⊂ PN be an irreducible, reduced, and non degenerate variety.
X
Assume that X is not 1-twd and πk+1
is generically finite, in particular X is not
(k + 1)-defective. If X is k-twd then γk < γk+1 .
Proof. The variety X is not 1-twd, then we may assume, without loss of generality,
that
γk−1 < γk = γk+1 .
Then γk+1 < n and Seck+1 (X) ( PN , hence by e) in Theorem 13, the contact
loci are of type II and linearly independent linear spaces. Fix {x1 , . . . , xk , y} ⊂ X
a set of general points and let
Γ(x1 , . . . , xk , y) = ∪k1 Pi ∪ Py
the contact locus. Moreover the assumption γk = γk+1 and point a) in Theorem 13
force
Γ(x1 , . . . , xk−1 , y) = ∪1k−1 Pi ∪ Py ,
with the same Pi ’s. Then
\
hTx1 X, . . . , Txk−1 X, Ty Xi ⊃ hTz Xiz∈Pi ,i=1,. . . , k-1
y∈X

We are assuming that γk−1 < γk therefore

Pi 6⊂ Γ(x1 , . . . , xk−1 ),
and we have a proper inclusion
hTz Xiz∈Pi ,i=1,. . . , k-1 ) hTx1 X, . . . , Txk−1 Xi.

Set
MAi = hTx1 X, . . . , Txk−1 X, Tyi Xi,
for general points y1 , y2 ∈ X. Then we have
MA1 ∩ MA2 ⊃ hTz Xiz∈Pi ,i=1,. . . , k-1 ) hTx1 X, . . . , Txk−1 Xi.
and we conclude that
(MA1 ∩ MA2 ) ∩ Tyi 6= ∅.
This shows that
hTx1 X, . . . , Txk−1 X, Ty1 Xi ∩ Ty2 X 6= ∅.
hence the k-tangential projection τkX is of fiber type and by Lemma 16 we derive
X
the contradiction that πk+1
is of fiber type.

Remark 21. Let us recall that 1-twd varieties are classified in [GH] and are essentially generalized developable varieties. In particular they are ruled by linear
spaces and, with the unique exception of linear spaces, they are singular.
We are ready to apply the above results to get not tangentially weakly defectiveness and hence identifiability statements.
Corollary 22. Let X ⊂ PN be an irreducible, reduced, and non degenerate variety
that is not 1-twd, for instance a smooth variety or a variety that is not covered by
linear spaces. Assume that πkX is generically finite and k ≥ dim X.
Then X is not (k − dim X)-twd and it is not (k − dim X + 1)-twd if πkX is not
dominant. If moreover either k > 2 dim X or πkX is not dominant and k ≥ 2 dim X
then X is not (k − 1)-twd.
In all the above cases X is h-identifiable.
Proof. By hypothesis πh is generically finite for any h ≤ k. Then by Theorem 20 if
it is j-twd
γj < γj+1 .
The contact locus is a subvariety of X, hence γk−dim X = 0. This proves the first
statement.
If πkX is not dominant then the contact locus is a proper subvariety and we have
γk−dim X+1 = 0.
Assume that k ≥ 2 dim X then by the first part X is not j-twd for some j >
dim X. Then we apply Theorem 18 recursively to conclude. We derive identifiability
by Proposition 14.

Remark 23. The first part of Corollary 22 extends the bounds in [BBC] to non
1-twd varieties. The main novelty is the second part that allows to derive identifiability from non defectivity for large enough secant varieties.
3. Application to tensor and structured tensor spaces
As we already mentioned identifiability is particularly interesting for tensor
spaces. In this section we use our main result to explicitly state identifiability
of a variety of tensor spaces. For this we will consider Segre, Segre-Veronese and
Grassmannian varieties and their h-twd properties.
We start with some notation
Notation 24. The variety Σ(d1 , ..., dr ; n1 , ..., nr ) is the Segre-Veronese embedding
Q ni +di

The defectivity of Segre and Segre-Veronese varieties is in general very far from
being completely understood, [AOP] [AB] [AMR], but it is in better shape than
their identifiability. For the latter the best asymptotic bounds we are aware of is
in [BBC].
We start proving the theorem in the introduction.
Theorem 26. Let X = X1k ∼
= (P1 )k . Then X is not h-twd and hence h-identifiable
in the following range:
- (k, h) = (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 4), (6, 9),
- k ≥ 7 h < s(X)
Proof. For k ≤ 5 this is well known, and can be easily checked also via a direct
computation with commutative algebra software. For k = 6 this has been checked
in [BC] by a computer aided computation. Let us fix k ≥ 7. By [CGG, Theorem
4.1] X is never defective. In particular the morphism πhX is generically finite for
h ≤ sk1 . When k ≥ 7 we have
2 dim X = 2k <

2k
− 1 < sk1 ,
k+1

then we can apply Corollary 22.



Remark 27. The Theorem answers positively Conjecture 1.2 in [BC] when the
2k
generic rank is an integer, that is k+1
∈ N. For k ≤ 6 the one listed are the only
identifiable cases.
For 3-factors Segre we plug [CO] directly in Theorem 18 to get the following.
Theorem 28. Let X = Xn3 . Then X is h-identifiable for h < s(X).

FROM NON DEFECTIVITY TO IDENTIFIABILITY

11

Proof. For n ≤ 7 the statement is proved in [CO, Theorem 1.2]. For n > 7, by
[Li], the variety X is not h-defective for h ≤ s3n and by the results in [CO] X is not
h-twd for h = 3n, confront the table in [CO, Theorem 1.2] . Then we are in the
condition to apply Theorem 18 recursively to prove that X is not h-twd, and hence

identifiable, for h < s3n .
For general diagonal Segre we have a similar statement using [AOP].
Theorem 29. Let X = Xnk , with n ≥ 2 and k ≥ 4. Let
n ≥ δ(X) ≡ skn mod(n + 1)
Then X is not h-twd and hence h−identifiable for h < s(X) − δ(X). In particular
when δ(X) = 0 X is h-identifiable for all h < s(X).
Proof. Using the notations in [CO, Theorem 6.7] let α be the greatest integer such
that n + 1 ≥ 2α . First we prove the statement for all but finitely many cases.
Claim 1. If
(k, n) 6∈



(k,6) with k ≤ 6,
(k,4) with k ≤ 5,

(k,5) with k ≤ 5,
(k,3) with k ≤ 4

then X is h−identifiable for h < s(X) − δ(X)



Proof. By [AOP, Theorem 5.2] we know that X is not h-defective as long as h ≤
s(X) − δ(X). The variety Xnk is not h−twd for
h ≤ 2(k−1)α−(k−1) = 2(k−1)(α−1)
by [CO, Theorem 6.7]. Let us assume that n 6= 2. A short hand computation shows
that
2(k−1)(α−1) > dim(X) = kn
is satisfied for every (k, n) in the list. Then, using recursively Theorem 18, we
conclude.

For the case n = 2 it is easy to check that the inequality
3k
⌋ − δ(X2k ) > 4k = 2dim(X2k )
2k + 1
is satisfied for every k ≥ 5 and so we can conclude using Corollary 22. When
(k, n) = (6, 6), (5, 6) we have the inequalities
sk2 = ⌊

s66 − δ(X66 ) > 2 · 36 = 2 dim X66
and
s56 − δ(X65 ) > 2 · 30 = 2 dim X65 .
Then we conclude by Corollary 22.
For all the remaining cases we have that (n + 1)k ≤ 15000 and we may use the
computation in [COV1, Theorem 1.1] to conclude the required identifiability.

The next class of Segre varieties we treat in details is given by
X[k, n] := Pk × (Pn )k+1 .
For these varieties we have
gr(X[k, n]) =

(k + 1)(n + 1)k+1
= (n + 1)k .
(k + 1)n + k + 1

In particular gr(X[k, n]) = s(X[k, n]) is always an integer, that is X[k, n] is always
perfect. Thanks to this special condition we have the following.
Theorem 30. Let X = X[k, n] with n odd and k > 1. Then X is h−identifiable
for h < gr(X).

12

ALEX CASAROTTI AND MASSIMILIANO MELLA

Proof. The proof is entirely similar to that of Theorem 29. Indeed by [AOP, Theorem 5.11] we know that all these Segre are non defective. If
(k, n) 6= (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5)
the inequality
(n + 1)k > 2(k + kn + n) = 2dim(X)
is satisfied and we conclude using Corollary 22. For all the exceptional cases we
have
(k + 1)(n + 1)k+1 ≤ 15000
hence we may apply [COV1, Theorem 1.1].

Remark 31. Defective Segre are expected to be quite rare, beside the unbalanced
ones, see the conjecture in [AOP]. This conjecture has been checked via a computer in many cases, [Va] [COV1]. For all these special values our argument gives
identifiability confirming the numerical computation in [COV1].
Next we apply the same strategy to Segre–Veronese varieties. For this class of
varieties the defectivity results are much weaker and so are our bounds. Again the
special case of binary forms is in better shape. We start recalling the notation of
[LP].
Definition 32. We say that (d1 , ..., dr ; n) is special if
(d1 , ..., dr ; n) = (2, 2a; 2a + 1), (1, 1, 2a; 2a + 1), (2, 2, 2; 7), (1, 1, 1, 1; 3)
for a ≥ 1. Otherwise (d1 , ..., dr ; n) is called not special.
Theorem 33. Let X = Σ(d1 , ..., dr ; 1, .., 1) with r = dimX. Assume that (d1 , ..., dr ; n)
is not special and r ≥ 6. Then X is h−identifiable for h < s(X).
Proof. We are assuming that (d1 , ..., dr ; n) is not special. Then, by [LP, Theorem
2.1], the variety X is not h-defective for h ≤ gr(X). Thanks to Theorem 26 we
may assume, without loss of generality that d1 > 1 and we have
s(X) = ⌊
In particular

(d1 + 1) · · · (dr + 1)
3 · 2r−1
⌋≥
− 1.
r+1
r+1
3 · 2r−1
− 1 > 2r = 2dimX
r+1

holds for every r ≥ 6.
The variety X is not 1-twd and so we conclude by Corollary 22.



For general Segre-Veronese we have the following.
Theorem 34. Let X := Σ(d1 , ..., dr , n1 , ..., nr ) be the Segre–Veronese variety. Assume r ≥ 2,
⌊log (d−1)⌋
n1 2
≥ 2(n1 + . . . + nr ),
⌊log2 (d−1)⌋

and set d = d1 + . . . + dr . Then X is h−identifiable for h ≤ n1

− 1.

Proof. By [AMR, Theorem 1.1] X is not h-defective for
⌊log2 (d−1)⌋

h ≤ n1

− (n1 + ... + nr ) + 1.

In our numerical assumptions Sech (X) ( PN and we may assume
h ≥ 2 dim X.
Then we conclude by Corollary 22.


n

Remark 35. For the Veronese variety of P , that is Σ(d1 , n1 ) it is easy, via Corollary 22 and [AH], to reprove the identifiability results in [Me] and [COV2].

FROM NON DEFECTIVITY TO IDENTIFIABILITY

13

As in the Segre case, for special classes of Segre–Veronese therePare better non
defectivity results. Here we recall the notation in [AB]. Let X := (1, 2; m, n) be
the Segre-Veronese variety Pm × Pn embedded by O(1, 2) in PN where

the meaningful numbers of X. With this in mind we have the following.

Corollary 36. Let X = (1, 2; m, n). If n > r(m, n) and

(m + 1) n+2

m+n+1
then X is not h−twd and hence h−identifiable for h < s(X).
Proof. In our range X is not h-defective by [AB, Theorem 1.1] and Sech (X) ( PN .
Moreover

(m + 1) n+2

s(X) = ⌊
m+n+1
and we may apply Corollary 22 to conclude.

Let us consider now the case of Pm × Pn embedded with O(1, d) for d ≥ 3.
P
Corollary 37. Let X = (1, d; m, n) with d ≥ 3 and m, n ≥ 1. Let

s(X) = max s ∈ N|s is a multiple of (m + 1) and s ≤ ⌊
m+n+1
If s(X) > 2(m + n) then X is not h-twd and hence h-identifiable for h < s(X).
Proof. By [BCC, Theorem 2.3] X is not h-defective for h ≤ s(X) and Sech (X) (
n+d
P(m+1)( d )−1 .
X is smooth, in particular it is not 1-twd. Since
s(X) > 2(m + n) = 2dim(X)
we can apply Corollary 22 to conclude.

Remark 38. Similar statements about subgeneric identifiability of P × P embedded with O(a, b) can be derived applying Corollary 22 using the non defectivity
results in [BBC1].
Finally we consider Grassmannian varieties. For this class of tensor spaces very
few is known about identifiability. To the best of our knowledge the following is
the first non computer aided result for them.
Theorem 39. Let X = G(k, n) such that 2k + 1 ≤ n. Assume that

ALEX CASAROTTI AND MASSIMILIANO MELLA

Proof. By [MR, Theorem 5.4] in our numerical range X is not h−defective and
Sech (X) ( PN . Then we conclude by Corollary 22.

The technique we developed can be applied to many other classes of varieties,
once it is known their defectivity behavior. As a sample we conclude with the
following example.
Example 40. C. Améndola, J.-C. Faugre, K. Ranestad and B. Sturmfels in [AFS]
and [ARS] studied the Gaussian moment variety
G1,d ⊂ Pd
whose points are the vectors of all moments of degree ≤ d of a 1−dimensional
Gaussian distribution. They proved that G1,d is a surface for every d and Sech (G1,d )
has always the expected dimension. In [BBC, Example 5.8] it is shown that G1,d is
not uniruled by lines, in particular it is not 1-twd. As usual let

s(G1,d ) = ⌊
