Diffusion and superdiffusion from hydrodynamic projection

Hydrodynamic projections, the projection onto conserved charges representing ballistic propagation of fluid waves, give exact transport results in many-body systems, such as the exact
Drude weights. Focussing one one-dimensional systems, I show that this principle can be extended beyond the Euler scale, in particular to the diffusive and superdiffusive scales. By hydrodynamic reduction, Hilbert spaces of observables are constructed that generalise the standard
space of conserved densities and describe the finer scales of hydrodynamics. The Green-Kubo
formula for the Onsager matrix has a natural expression within the diffusive space. This space
is associated with quadratically extensive charges, and projections onto any such charge give
generic lower bounds for diffusion. In particular, bilinear expressions in linearly extensive charges
lead to explicit diffusion lower bounds calculable from the thermodynamics, and applicable for
instance to generic momentum-conserving one-dimensional systems. Bilinear charges are interpreted as covariant derivatives on the manifold of maximal entropy states, and represent the
contribution to diffusion from scattering of ballistic waves. An analysis of fractionally extensive
charges, combined with clustering properties from the superdiffusion phenomenology, gives lower
bounds for superdiffusion exponents. These bounds reproduce the predictions of nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics, including the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang exponent 2/3 for sound-like modes,
the Levy-distribution exponent 3/5 for heat-like modes, and the full Fibonacci sequence.

Introduction

Finding organising principles for emergent many-body behaviours is one of the most important
tasks of theoretical physics. Thermodynamics and hydrodynamics offer powerful frameworks,
based on the postulates that states and dynamics emerging at large scales are described by
2

few, long-lived degrees of freedom [1]. However, characterising these degrees of freedom and
quantifying their effects are difficult problems. This is especially true beyond the Euler scale,
where one would like to study the Onsager matrix, representing diffusion, in a model-independent
way. In one dimension, a particularly rich phenomenology of diffusion and superdiffusion is
observed. Nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics (NFH) [2] offers flexible tools and has been
very successful especially for classical, conventional fluids but also beyond, see e.g. [3, 4, 5,
6]. More microscopic methods include the consideration of conserved quantities [7], and in
integrable systems, generalised hydrodynamics [8, 9] and Bethe-ansatz techniques, which have
provided much insight [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. But despite this progress, a framework for
establishing general and rigorous results is still largely lacking.
In this paper, focussing on one dimension, I propose to organise observables of quantum
and classical many-body systems into equivalence classes with Hilbert space structures, which
naturally extract their contributions at finer and finer scales of hydrodynamics. The construction is based on the available one-parameter groups of transformations, such as space and time
translations, and clustering properties of local and quasi-local observables, and is similar to
the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction in C ∗ algebras. The Drude weight, Onsager matrix,
hydrodynamic equations and hydrodynamic entropy production are naturally expressed using
the inner products on Hilbert spaces associated to the ballistic and diffusive scales. In particular, the diffusive Hilbert space Hdif gives rise to a formally exact projection formula for the
Onsager matrix, similar to the standard hydrodynamic projection [1, 18] for the Drude weight.
Superdiffusive scales correspond to a family of Hilbert spaces parameterised by the superdiffusive
exponent.
I explain how these Hilbert spaces can be related to spaces of conserved charges with various
extensivity properties. The linearly extensive charges, studied in greater detail in [19, 20],
represent the ballistic scale. These are simply related to the standard conserved quantities of
many-body systems, such as the total energy and momentum, and are known to bound the
Drude weight [21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. I show, likewise, that the quadratically extensive charges
give rise to generic lower bounds on the Onsager matrix coefficients, generalising Prosen’s lower
bound [7]. Further, fractionally extensive charges give generic lower bounds for superdiffusion
exponents.
Bilinear expressions in conserved quantities are examples of quadratically extensive charges.
Analysing these, I obtain a number of results providing explicit lower bounds for diffusion
and superdiffusion, which are calculable purely from the thermodynamic averages of conserved
densities and currents. The strength of the result depends on the assumed space-time clustering
properties of three-point functions in the state of interest.
Under Lieb-Robinson-type clustering, which is rigorous in quantum chains for instance, the
diagonal Onsager
P matrix element for the current jk is strictly positive, and may be infinite, if
hQi Qj jk ic − mn hQi Qj qm ic Cmn hQm jk ic does not vanish (qi are conserved densities, Qi their
total space integral, Cij is the static covariance matrix, Cij is its inverse, and h· · ·ic are connected correlation functions). A linear response calculation of Euler-scale three-point functions
shows that clustering is in fact controlled by hydrodynamic velocities. This gives stronger lower
bounds. In particular, it reproduces the result from NFH that the diagonal Onsager matrix
elements must be infinite whenever the NFH three-point couplings are nonzero. Further assuming a finer clustering properties set by power laws around ballistic trajectories, I show that the
3

superdiffusion exponent is bounded from below as α ≥ 2/3 if the fully diagonal three-point coupling is nonzero and the scaling function has finite variance. The lower bound is the exponent
of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class that is expected by NFH in this case. I obtain
other lower bounds from partially diagonal three-point couplings and scaling functions with fat
tails, which, if saturated, reproduce exponents for the heat mode (3/5) and for the Fibonacci
sequence [26, 27, 28] predicted by NFH and mode coupling theory [2, 26]. Thus, various aspects
of superdiffusion up to now only accessible via NFH, are seen as consequences of Hilbert space
structures along with clustering from simple superdiffusion phenomenology, without the need
for the hydrodynamic equation or the addition of phenomenological noise.
The space of linearly extensive charges is the tangent space to the manifold of maximal
entropy states. I show that the covariant derivatives are obtained from the bilinear charges. The
Hilbert space they span, the wave scattering space Hscat ⊂ Hdif , has the physical interpretation
as that of two-body scattering states of ballistic waves. In particular, it is seen that states formed
of co-propagating (same-velocity) ballistic waves are at the source of superdiffusion. Projection
onto Hscat reproduces a formula for the Onsager matrix conjectured recently [29] from a ideas
based on NFH. As anticipated in this work, this formula is therefore here shown to provide a
lower bound for the Onsager matrix.
It is observed in [29] that the formula obtained agrees, when specialised to the hydrodynamics
of integrable systems [8, 9], with the exact Onsager matrix. The latter was obtained by a form
factor expansion in [10, 11], and its diagonal part was derived from a linear response mechanism
in [12]. Thus, the projection onto Hscat saturates the Onsager matrix in integrable systems.
From this perspective, the present results and techniques put in a precise framework some of
the ideas in [29, 10, 11, 12].
Finally, interpreting the diffusive and wave-scattering Hilbert spaces, I propose a precise
notion of many-body integrability, paralleling the Liouville condition that the number of conservation laws must agree with that of degrees of freedom.
The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 the hydrodynamic spaces are introduced,
and their relation with the Drude weight and the Onsager matrix are explained. In Section 3,
extensive charges are defined and their consequences on generic lower bounds for diffusion and
superdiffusion are proven. In Section 4, bilinear charges are introduced, and the explicit lower
bounds discussed above are derived. In Section 5, the relation with the hydrodynamic equation,
the geometric interpretation of the ballistic and wave-scattering spaces, and the proposal for
many-body integrability are discussed. Concluding remarks are made in Section 6.

Hydrodynamic spaces

In this section I describe an abstract and general construction which organises observables of
many-body systems into equivalence classes representing their contributions at various scales
of hydrodynamics. One-dimensional systems are the focus, although the extension to higher
dimensions is natural. The construction does not require any specific underlying many-body
system. The basic object is a set of “local observables”, that is a linear space (assumed countabledimensional for simplicity) V over C. The main structure on V is a positive-semidefinite sesquilinear form h·, ·iH on V⊗C V. In order to obtain the Hilbert space H from B, elements in V that have
4

zero norm in the inner product (hence zero inner product with everything else) are moded-out,
and the resulting equivalence classes are completed by Cauchy sequences. Thus we have:
V⊂H

a Hilbert space,

h·, ·iH

an inner product.

(1)

A useful example, where strong mathematical results exist and many of the requirements
below can be shown rigorously, is that of quantum and classical spin chains in the thermodynamic
limit (on infinite length). A framework for these models is that of uniformly hyperfinite C ∗
algebras [30], but I will not explicitly use any detail of this description. In this framework, the
local observables in V can be chosen to be the observables of the chain supported on a finite
number of sites, or the quasi-local observables [31]. We have an anti-linear involution a 7→ a † ,
and on V, a state h· · ·i acts as a positive linear functional, giving the averages or expectations
of local observables.
When a state is given, a natural sesquilinear form is simply the expectation of the products
ha, biH = ha † bi.

(2)

In the context of C ∗ algebras, this is the basis of the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal (GNS) construction,
where zero-norm elements are moded-out and the result is Cauchy completed, as described above.
For convenience, below I assume that a state is given on V, and that the inner product is (2). It
should be clear that many aspects of the general constructions do not actually require a state,
only a formal inner product.
Note that the Hilbert space H is not related to any underlying Hilbert space of quantum
models; this abstract construction is valid for classical and quantum models, deterministic or
stochastic.

2.1

Hydrodynamic reduction

Suppose that there is some action of a one-parameter group of unitary operators Us on H, with
Us Us′ = Us+s′ . I take s ∈ R, but the main property for the present discussion is that the group
be non-compact; there is no difficulty in adapting to s ∈ Z. In the continuous notation, I assume
that Us is “well behaved”, that is, that the resulting inner products are continuous, and, in some
instances, I assume differentiability. By unitarity, Us preserves the inner product,
hUs a, Us biH = ha, biH .

(3)

For instance, Us could be the group of space- or time-translations, or any other symmetry of
the underlying model, under which the state is chosen to be invariant. Again, note that this
does not require the underlying model to be quantum or even deterministic: Us acts, and is
invertible, on the abstract Hilbert space H, and unitarity is the result of an invariance. Note
that in quantum spin chains, time translation is a strongly continuous one-parameter group on
H, hence continuity, and differentiability, is guaranteed [30].
As a guiding principle, emergent properties of many-body systems with respect to the group
Us are essentially those which come out from taking s large in some sense, and are extracted by
looking at invariants. There are two natural ways of extracting invariants.
5

First, one may simply restrict to the subspace
Q = ∩s ker(Us − 1).

(4)

This is the subspace of all observables on which all Us act trivially. This is a closed subspace,
hence we can make orthogonal projections. Let P denote the orthogonal projection onto Q. I
call this process hydrodynamic projection (to be taken in a general sense), and denote it by
H
↓P
Q

(5)

The space Q may be a very small space; for instance, in many natural states of quantum
spin chains, the only local observables that are invariant under space translations are those
proportional to the “identity observable” 1 (the identity operator on the chain)1 , so Q = C1.
The second way goes into more details of the behaviour at large s. We instead consider
the equivalence classes with respect to Us , providing this with a Hilbert space structure by
integrating over s. As the group is non-compact, convergence needs to be imposed, and for this
the kernel needs to be taken away. More precisely, suppose that, for some subspace V′ ⊂ H (the
“nucleus”), there is a property of “projection at infinity”. That is, at large s, the observable
Us a tends, in a weak sense, to an element in Q, for all a ∈ V′ ,
hUs a, biH − hPa, biH → 0 sufficiently fast as |s| → ∞

(a, b ∈ V′ ).

(6)

A precise statement is boundedness of the left-hand side by a quantity proportional to |s|−d for
d large enough (d > 1 is sufficient for many purposes). Then we can form the hydrodynamic
Hilbert space. We consider the new sesquilinear form2
Z
(8)
ha, biH′ = ds h(1 − P)Us a, biH
for all a, b ∈ V. The integral is taken over R. This is positive semidefinite, as by the assumption
(6), we can write it in an explicitly non-negative way,
Z n
Z n
1
dt h(1 − P)Us a, (1 − P)Ut biH
(9)
ds
ha, biH′ = lim
n→∞ 2n −n
−n
(see e.g. [19, Lem 4.2]). We mod out the associated null space, and Cauchy-complete the result,
obtaining a new Hilbert space H′ . On this space, Q ≡ {0} as it is projected out, and Us ≡ 1, as
we integrate over s in (8). Under certain mild conditions [20], it is possible to show that H′ , as
a set, is exactly the completion of the set of equivalence classes of V′ under a ≡ a + q for q ∈ Q,
1
On finite chains, homogeneous sums over the full space are trivially translation invariant; but here the chain
is infinite, so these sums are not within V of H (and are not part of the underlying C ∗ algebra).
2
Note the equivalent ways of writing:

h(1 − P)Us a, biH = h(1 − P)Us a, (1 − P)biH = hUs a, biH − hPa, PbiH .

6

(7)

and a ≡ Us a for s ∈ R. In Section 4 I will assume this. I call this process the hydrodynamic
reduction of H with respect to U , and pictorially represent it as
U

H → H′

(10)

(where I keep the information of the subspace V′ ⊂ H hidden).
Note that if I were averaging over s instead of integrating in (8), then by von Neumann’s
ergodic theorem [32], this would create the projection P. Here I subtract the projection, and
then integrate – looking, so to speak, at the next, nontrivial order.
The condition (6) is assumed to hold on V′ . It might not be satisfied for all elements in
H. It will be convenient to define the H′ -“lower norm” on all of H, which takes values in the
extended non-negative real numbers R̂ = R+ ∪ {∞}, by
Z n

−
ds(1 − P)Us a

(11)
||a||H′ = lim inf

This agrees with the norm ||a||H′ = ha, aiH′ if (6) holds for b = a. The upper norm could also
be considered, but as I will be considering lower bounds, the lower norm is more meaningful.

2.2

Ballistic and diffusive spaces

I now argue that the processes of hydrodynamic projections and reductions are at the basis of
the most fundamental objects of hydrodynamics: the Drude weight and the Onsager matrix,
which control the Euler and diffusive scales of the hydrodynamic equations.
Let me take the examples of homogeneous many-body systems in one dimension, which again
can be quantum or classical, and deterministic or stochastic. There are two natural symmetries
of the states and dynamics, leading to non-compact unitary groups on H: translations in space
and time, ιx and τt respectively. Again, here I use the continuous notation, but all results apply
in the discrete case as well (for instance, x ∈ Z in a quantum chain). In integrable systems,
there is in addition an infinite number of such groups: all the flows associated to the higher
(1)
(2)
Hamiltonians of the integrable hierarchy. For generality, let me take ιx = τx , τt = τt and
(3)
ηs = τs , and assume in total a certain number (which may be infinite) N ≥ 2 of nontrivial
(ℓ)
(ℓ)
flows, τs for ℓ ≥ 1 with τs = 1 for ℓ > N . I also assume that all flows commute.
Consider the following sequential construction. We first construct the hydrodynamic projection H′ of H with respect to ι (with nucleus V′ ⊂ H). On H′ , space translation is trivial,
ιx ≡ 1. However, there is a nontrivial time translation, and under general conditions (see [19,
Thm 6.3] and [20]), including the condition that V′ be in some sense large enough, it is on
H′ a well-behaved one-parameter group of unitaries, still denoted τt . Then, we construct the
hydrodynamic projection H′′ of H′ with respect to τ (with nucleus V′′ ⊂ H′ ). We continue the
process until the last nontrivial flow. Pictorially,
ι

These may be called the hydrodynamic spaces of 0th, 1st, 2nd, ... order. In equations, for
instance,

(13)
ha, biH = dt h(1 − Pτ )τt a, biH′ .
ha, biH = dx h(1 − Pι )ιx a, biH ,
7

Let me also consider the spaces of invariants and associated projections. In fact, as the flows
commute, in general one would expect that projecting onto the invariants of τ (ℓ) produces
invariants of all higher flows. For instance, the identity observable 1 in quantum chains is
trivially invariant under time translations, and all other flows if any. I then simply define
′

Q (ℓ) = ∩ℓ′ >ℓ ∩s ker(τs(ℓ ) − 1)

(14)

and denote in particular Pι : H → Q, Pτ : H′ → Q ′ and Pη : H′′ → Q ′′ . Note that Q (N ) = H(N ) ,
and so if N = 2 then Pη = 1.
I claim that the sequence of spaces of invariants (14) encode the physics of many-body
systems at finer and finer hydrodynamic scales. In particular, I call Q the thermodynamic space,
Q ′ the ballistic space, and Q ′′ the diffusive space:
Q = Hth ,
Thus, pictorially,

Q ′′ = Hdif .

(15)

(16)

I will use the notation
ha, bidif = hPη a, biH′′ .

ha, bibal = hPτ a, biH′ ,

(17)

I now justify this claim by connecting with the Drude weights and Onsager matrix. The connection to the hydrodynamic equation is discussed in Section 5.

2.3

Drude weights and Onsager matrix

Recall that the original inner product comes from an average as per (2). As mentioned, in most
cases, the only translation-invariant local observables are those proportional to the identity,
Hth = C1, thus this is assumed here for simplicity. Then, the projection onto Hth is just
subtracting the average of the observable:
Pι a = 1h1, aiH = 1hai.

(18)

That is, the thermodynamic space is nothing but the set of averages of local observables, and this
indeed describes the thermodynamics. The presence of a higher-dimensional space of ι-invariant
should be associated with phase co-existence, see for instance [30, 33].
Second, we now see that ha, biH′ is just the space-integrated connected two-point function:
Z
(19)
ha, biH′ = dx ha(x)b(0)ic = hAbic
R
where a(x) = ιx a and I denote by capital letters the formal total space integrals, dx a(x) = A.
In quantum spin chains, in any Gibbs state with respect to a local enough Hamiltonian, the
requirement (6) follows for local observables from a standard result of Araki [34]. The inner
8

product (19) and the associated Hilbert space H′ have been studied in the context of many-body
systems [19]. The space of invariants Hbal can be shown rigorously to control the correlation
functions at Euler scales [20]. It is the space of conserved densities of the model; for instance, if
observables q and j are related as
∂t q(x, t) + ∂x j(x, t) = 0

(20)

where a(x, t) = ιx τt a, then clearly ∂t q(x, t) = 0 in H′ , as the action of ιx is trivial, hence
q ∈ Hbal (here seeing q as representing the H′ -equivalence class). Denoting by qi a basis for
Hbal , we have
X
(21)
Pτ a =
qi Cij hqj , aiH′
i

Cij

where
is the inverse of the static covariance matrix Cij = hqi , qj iH′ (see Appendix A).
Of interest is the large-time limit, or time-average, of overlaps where one observable is evolved
in time. By von Neumann’s ergodic theorem (see the precise statement in [20]), this projects
onto Hbal ,
Z T
1
(22)
hτt a, biH′ = ha, bibal .
Da,b = lim
T →∞ 2T −T
If a = ji and b = jj are chosen to be currents associated to conserved densities, then Da,b
is the widely-studied Drude weight characterising ballistic transport [1]. Thus indeed Hbal is
associated to ballistic transport. In particular, we obtain the hydrodynamic projection formula
for the Drude weight [1, 18],
X
Da,b =
ha, qi ibal Cij hqj , bibal .
(23)
ij

Finally, we can re-write the inner product in H′′ as
Z
hZ
i
c
′′
La,b = ha, biH = dt
dx ha(x, t)b(x, t)i − Da,b .

(24)

Taking again a = ji and b = jj , Eq. (24) is nothing else but the Green-Kubo formula for the
Onsager matrix,
Lij = Lji ,jj .
(25)
The Onsager matrix is simply related to the diffusion matrix [1] (see also [11]). Recall that by
construction qi ≡ 0 in H′′ . Hence these are not nontrivial elements of the invariants Hdif . But
it is possible to show that the current observables ji are invariants. This is a result obtained in
a different context [35], and reproduced in Appendix B. That is, if ji ∈ H′′ , then
ji ∈ Hdif .

(26)

The invariance of currents is, of course, a non-empty statement only if there are nontrivial higher
flows, N > 2. Thus we obtain a hydrodynamic projection formula for the Onsager matrix,
Lij = hji , jj idif .
9

(27)

This justifies the claim that the space of invariants Hdif encodes the physics of hydrodynamic
diffusion3 .
Here, however, the requirement (6) (for H′ instead of H) does not follow from standard
results. The limit defining the Onsager matrix may not exist. Nevertheless, at least for the
diagonal elements, one can always define the lower Onsager matrix elements using the lower
norm (11), as
2
2
−
(28)
Lii− = ||ji ||−
La,a
= ||a||−
H′′ .
H′′ ,

These exist in the extended reals for all a ∈ H′ , ji ∈ H′ . The phenomenology suggests that
in typical non-integrable systems, the requirement (6) is indeed broken for many observables,
including some (or all) conserved currents ji , and that one has
Lii− = ∞

for many currents ji in typical non-integrable systems.

(29)

In integrable systems, the Onsager matrix elements appear to be finite for a large class of currents
[10, 11, 12], but not for all [13, 14, 15, 16, 17].
Much like in (23), we can expand in a basis {wα } for Hdif ,
X
ha, bidif =
ha, wα idif C αβ hwβ , bidif ,
(30)
α,β

where C αβ is the inverse of the diffusive covariance matrix Cαβ ,
Cαβ = hwα , wβ iH′′ .

(31)

If we know the elements wα and how to evaluate the components of a and b on these, we have
an exact projection formula for the Onsager matrix. In order for this to be useful, we need to
characterise the basis elements wα . Characterising the elements wα is where all the physics of
diffusion lies. In order to partially address this, I discuss the relation between the hydrodynamic
spaces and extensive charges in Section 3.
Remark 2.1. Observe that the conserved densities qi are defined as elements of H′ , not of
the original space of observables. In trying to define qi as an element of H, there are two
potential problems: it may be a Cauchy sequence of elements of V′ , which converges in H′
but not necessarily in H; and there is ambiguity under shifts qi (x) 7→ qi (x) + a1 and qi (x) 7→
qi (x) + ∂x a(x). Most physical quantities are insensitive to such problems, and thus H′ is the
correct space; but some expressions do require to define qi ∈ H. In many cases, it is possible to
choose V′ ⊂ H (the nucleus for H′ ) large enough so that every basis element qi of Hbal can be
chosen as an equivalence class of some element in V′ , without the need to take Cauchy sequences.
For instance, the set of quasi-local conserved densities in quantum spin chains is believed to be
complete (to form a basis for Hbal ), as can be inferred from the Bethe-ansatz results [31].
R
Remark 2.2. It is usually the case that the conserved charges Qi = dx qi (x) generate flows on
the observables in H, with infinitesimal generator given, on a dense subspace, by the commutator
3

In the present work, the invariance of currents under higher flows does not actually play a fundamental role,
except for the structural symmetry of (16).

10

(Poisson bracket) in quantum (classical) systems, [Qi , ·]. Further, it is also often the case that
many (although not necessarily all) of these flows commute with each other. Throughout, I
(ℓ)
assume that the commuting flows τs are generated by some subset (which may be the full set)
of the conserved charges Qi , and that all Qi ’s are invariant under all such flows (this is part of
the statement (14)).

2.4

Fractional-order spaces and superdiffusion

As mentioned, in the general setup of Subsection 2.1 it may happen that for some elements
a ∈ H the requirement (6) is not satisfied: the vanishing is not strong enough for the integral
(8) to exist. In particular, it may be that ||a||−
H′ = ∞. It is then natural to define Hilbert spaces
at fractional orders. A proposition is, for u ∈ (0, 1),

(40)

For my purposes, the construction of H(u) for u ∈ (1, 2) is the most relevant. In these
cases, if a current observable lies in H(u) , then it still actually lies in the subspace of invariants
Q(u) ⊂ H(u) under higher flows, by the calculation of Appendix B. This space of invariants is,
in some sense, “between” the ballistic and diffusive spaces.
Physically, this space represents superdiffusion. Indeed, recall the phenomenology of superdiffusivity. This purports that the two-point functions of a superdiffusive normal mode qI
(see Appendix A; my convention is that normal modes are labelled by capital letters) take a
scaling form at large x, t
1  x − vIeff t 
f
(41)
hqI (x, t)qI (0, 0)ic ∼
|λt|α
|λt|α

where f (z) integrates to 1, λ > 0 and α ∈ (1/2, 1) (the case α = 1/2 would be normal diffusion).
For the purpose of this discussion, it is sufficient to assume that vIeff = 0 and that f (z) be
symmetric. This does not affect the scaling analysis; for instance, a zero velocity in many cases
can be achieved by appropriate Gallilean or relativistic boosts. In (41) and below, the notation
is slightly abused as we must take qI ∈ V instead of qI ∈ H′ , and use (21) on V. See Remark
2.1.
The precise shape of f (z), which can be obtained from nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics
(NFH) [2], is not important for the present consideration. It will be crucial, however, to distinguish two classes: “normal superdiffusion”, where f (z) decays fast enough at large |z| in order
to have finite variance
Z
dz z 2 f (z) < ∞ (normal superdiffusion),
(42)

and “fat superdiffusion”, where f (z) has infinite variance. In the latter case, a more accurate
characterisation is necessary. Results from NFH [2] suggest that the normalisation coefficient of
the fat tail grows proportionally to t, hqI (x, t)qI (0, 0)ic ∝ |t|xν for some ν, for |x| ≫ |λt|α and at
large |t|. A possible phenomenological explanation is that at very large distances, the fat tail of
superdiffusion should be controlled by ballistic processes, and that with these, the correlation
grows, at fixed position, linearly in time. Thus, in the fat superdiffusion case, I assume

1
− 1+ α
(fat superdiffusion)
(43)
f (z) ∼ c|z|
12

for some c > 0, at large |z|.
By applying time derivatives and space integrals, one extracts the appropriately decaying
current-current correlation function. Then (41) implies that (see Appendix C)
h(1 − Pτ )jI (x, t) (1 − Pτ )jI (0, 0)ic ∼

(45)

at large |t|. In contrast, in the fat superdiffusion case, notwithstanding the overall normalisation
coefficient, the space integral of the right-hand side of (44) does not exist, as it decays as |x|1−1/α .
However, the space integral of the current-current connected correlation function still exists, as
this is a two-point function of local observables. The resolution is that the asymptotic power
law in (44) is valid, for any given t, only in a (large) region of space around x = 0. This region
grows at most proportionally to t if there is a Lieb-Robinson bound. In fact, one would expect
the region to be determined by the available hydrodynamic velocities. For instance, for the heat
mode in anharmonic chains, which is found to have fat superdiffusion by NFH, the region lies
between the two sound modes, see the discussion in [2]. Therefore, integrating over this region,
one obtains
1
(46)
h(1 − Pτ )jI (x, t), jI (0, 0)iH′ ∝ |t|1− α (1 + o(t))

where the nonzero proportionality constant depends on the growth rate of the region, and is not
important in what follows.
Using (43) in the exact asymptotic (44), one in fact finds a vanishing leading-asymptotic
coefficient, (1 − 2α)h(z) + α∂z (zh(z)) ∼ 0 × z 1−1/α . However, the precise coefficient of the
asymptotic as evaluated from (43) is not expected to be meaningful, as it is affected by other
modes at large distances |x| ≫ |λt|α . Thus only the power law of the asymptotic should be
meaningful, and (46) holds.
The above discussion also suggests that fat superdiffusion can only occur for modes whose
ballistic trajectories lie between that of other modes; these provide the linearly increasing region
necessary to contain the power-law decay. However I will not investigate this aspect further.
The discussion from Eq. (41) to Eq. (46) is based on the phenomenology of superdiffusion.
The form (41) says that the normal modes propagate ballistically, with a superdiffusive extension
controlled by the exponent α around the ballistic trajectory of velocity vIeff . Both results (45)
and (46) lead to the divergence of the Onsager matrix element LII , because the resulting power
law is not integrable. Thus, jI is not an element of H′′ , but instead
jI ∈ H(3−2α) (normal superdiffusion)

jI ∈ H(1/α)

(fat superdiffusion)

according to (38). This implies in particular the slightly weaker statements

(49)

Below, when obtaining results concerning superdiffusion, I will make precise clustering assumptions based on the phenomenology of (41) and (43). Further, for accuracy, I simply say that
a current observable jI ∈ H′ has normal (fat) superdiffusion exponent α if Eq. (48) (Eq. (49))
holds. Note that (49) was justified here based on the precise power-law requirement (43) for
fat superdiffusion, which was phenomenologically justified. Different power laws would lead to
different precise definitions of fat superdiffusion. This therefore appears to be a stronger assumption than the simpler finite-variance assumption of normal superdiffusion. However, the fact that
in both cases, the full range u ∈ (1, 2) is covered by the superdiffusion range α ∈ (1/2, 1), is a
good indication that these are generic situations.

Extensive charges and lower bounds on diffusion and superdiffusion

Extensive charges are sequences of observables which represent, in a more concrete fashion, the
equivalence classes discussed in the previous section. They serve here two purposes: first to
make the abstract hydrodynamic Hilbert spaces more concrete, and second to provide a way of
bounding (from below) the physical quantities which they represent, in particular the Onsager
matrix elements and superdiffusion exponents.

3.1

Linearly extensive charges
U

Let me consider the general context of Subsection 2.1, the reduction H → H′ with nucleus V′ .
The concept of extensive charges emerged from Prosen’s work on pseudolocal charges [36, 37],
and was developed in integrable spin chains [24, 25]. I gave a precise construction in [19] in the
context of quantum spin chains. I follow these lines here, and define linearly extensive charges
in the present more general context.
Consider a sequence Q = (Qn ∈ H : n ∈ N). Assume without loss of generality that
Qn = (1 − P)Qn for all n. Suppose there is a subspace D(Q) ⊂ H, the domain of Q, with
V′ ⊂ D(Q), such that the sequence satisfies the following conditions:
1. There exists γ > 0 such that ||Qn ||2H ≤ γn for all n ∈ N large enough.
2. The limit QH′ (a) := limn→∞ hQn , aiH exists for all a ∈ D(Q).
3. There exists k > 0 such that limn→∞ sups,t∈[−kn,kn] |hQn , Us a − Ut aiH | = 0 for all a ∈
D(Q).
A linearly extensive charge for H is an equivalence class of such sequences, under the equivalence
(1)
(2)
Q(1) ≡ Q(2) ⇔ QH′ (a) = QH′ (a) ∀ a ∈ D(Q). That is, the set of such limit-actions of such
sequences is the set of extensive charges.
The first point above states the linear extensivity of the charge. The third specifies that
the charge is extensive with respect to Us , and that it is homogeneous. The second specifies
14

that it acts well on D(Q). I emphasise that there is here no condition on these charges being
“conserved”: in the general setup there is no such notion, as only the one-parameter group U is
considered.
One can show that QH′ (·) is bounded with respect to the lower norm on H′ . As a consequence, on V′ it is continuous with respect to the norm on H′ , and by the Riesz representation
theorem, there exists b ∈ H′ such that
QH′ (a) = (b, a)H′

∀ a ∈ V′ .

(50)

Since V′ is dense in H′ , the map can be extended, by continuity, to all of H′ . This result,
although relatively abstract, has interesting consequences, as we will see.
The proof of boundedness is simple. I reproduce that of [19]. Let a ∈ D(Q). By Point 3
above and the assumption that Qn = (1 − P)Qn , there exists δn with limn→∞ δn = 0, such that
1
hQn , aiH =
2kn

Z

kn

ds hQn , (1 − P)Us a)H + δn .

(51)

The first term on the right-hand side is bounded by using the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality:

In particular, with (50) we find
||b||H′ ≤

Simple examples of such extensive charges are the (equivalence classes of the) sequences of
the form

(55)
Qn =

for b ∈ V′ , where one can take any 0 < k < 1/2. In this simple case, the limit action is
√
QH′ (a) = hb, aiH′ , and the norm is exactly ||b||H′ = γ.
In [19], this construction was used with U = ι space translations. It was also shown that
there is in fact a bijection between the set of linearly extensive charges, and the Hilbert space
H′ . The proof can be applied to the general construction presented here as well. Therefore
linearly extensive charges for H ∼
= H′ .

(56)

charges QH′ instead
This extends the second
R equation of (19) to arbitrary linearly extensive
′
of the particular A = dx a(x) constructed from elements a ∈ V . This establishes that the
correct completion of the space of such integrals of local densities is the Hilbert space H′ . I will
not need the exact isomorphism (56) in what follows.
15

3.2

Quadratically extensive charges

Now concentrate on the specific setup of Subsections 2.2 and 2.3.
There are (at least) two one-parameter groups, space translations ιx and time translations
τt . As the construction in Subsection 3.1 is completely general, we can therefore go further and
construct the linearly extensive charges for H′ . By the general result of Subsection 3.1, every
such charge is bounded on its domain by the lower norm for H′ , and gives rise, when acting
on V′′ , to an element of H′′ . In fact, the space of these is isomorphic to H′′ (which I again
state without proof as this will not be used). I will refer to these as the quadratically extensive
conserved charges for H:
quadratically extensive conserved charges for H
= linearly extensive charges for H′
∼
= H′′ .

(57)

The charges will be denoted QH′′ , and for every such charge, there exists b ∈ H′′ such that
QH′′ (a) = hb, aiH′′

(58)

for all a ∈ V′′ . Note that these are “conserved” by construction, as in H′′ , the group τt acts
R n/2
trivially. Naturally, sequences of the form Qn = −n/2 dt τt b for b ∈ V′′ give rise to linearly
extensive charges for H′ . Most interestingly, we obtain a bound on the H′′ -lower norm – or
Onsager matrix element – of elements of D(Q) on which QH′′ is nonzero:
Theorem 3.1. Let QH′′ be a quadratically extensive charge for H, and a ∈ D(Q). Then
−
La,a

2k
|QH′′ (a)|2 .
γ

(59)

If ji ∈ D(Q) and QH′′ (ji ) 6= 0, then the associated diagonal Onsager matrix element Lii− is
strictly positive (and may be infinite).
Why should linearly extensive charges for H′ be seen as quadratically extensive in H? Intuitively, extensivity for H′ requires, from the viewpoint of H, an integral on an interval of
distance n, whose position is integrated over the full space. As n goes to infinity, we have a
double integral over space. This will be made clearer in Section 4, where explicit examples are
discussed. In particular, there, it is seen that, with Qn supported on regions of length n, and if
a Lieb-Robinson bound is available,
0<k<

1
2vLR

(Qn on length n in space, Lieb-Robinson bound).

(60)

Another reason for the nomenclature lies in a construction by Prosen [7], which I show in
Appendix F leads to elements of H′′ . This construction appears to be slightly more restrictive
than the general definition of quadratically extensive conserved charges that I propose in (57),
because it requires an apparently stronger clustering property, Eq. (160). It is nevertheless useful
in practice.
16

3.3

Fractionally extensive charges

Let me go back to the general setup of Subsection 2.1. There is a natural way of modifying
the construction of linearly extensive charges of Subsection 3.1 in order to connect them to the
fractional-order spaces of Subsection 2.4. I define u-extensive charges for H by modifying Points
2 and 3 as follows, for u ∈ (0, 1):
2(u) . The limit QH(u) (a) := limn→∞ hQn , aiH exists for all a ∈ D(Q).

3(u) . There exists k > 0 such that limn→∞ sups,t∈[−kn1/u ,kn1/u ] |hQn , Us a − Ut aiH | = 0 for all
a ∈ D(Q).

We can bound the resulting charge by using
Z kn1/u
1
ds hQn , (1 − P)Us a)H + δn
hQn , aiH =
2kn1/u −kn1/u

and by bounding the first term as
s

Replacing n by kn1/u in (36), we obtain
√
(2k)−u/2 γ
|QH(u) (a)| ≤ √
||a||−

H(u)

Thus, there exists b ∈ H(u) such that, for all a ∈ H(u) ,
QH(u) (a) = hb, aiH(u) ,

||b||H(u) ≤

(2k)−u/2 γ

2−u

(63)

(64)

In the specific setup of Subsection 2.2, I now define, for u ∈ (1, 2), the u-extensive charges
for H as the (u − 1)-extensive charges for H′ . Therefore, for u ∈ (1, 2),
2(u) . The limit QH(u) (a) := limn→∞ hQn , aiH′ exists for all a ∈ D(Q).

3(u) . There exists k > 0 such that limn→∞ sups,t∈[−kn1/(u−1) ,kn1/(u−1) ] |hQn , τs a − τt aiH′ | = 0 for
all a ∈ D(Q),

and

|QH(u) (a)| ≤
We obtain the following:

Bilinear charges

I consider the specific context of Subsections 2.2 and 2.3. We have the space and time translation
groups ιx and τt , respectively, and a one-dimensional, homogeneous and stationary state h· · ·i.
From it, we form the ballistic space H′ and diffusive space H′′ , as per (16).
The construction of Section 3, and in particular the bounds obtained, are still relatively
abstract. Concrete bounds are obtained by choosing appropriate extensive charges. In this
section, I construct such charges and analyse their consequences. The strength of the bound
obtained depends on the assumption we can make on clustering properties of multi-point correlation functions. I will make in turn various assumptions increasing in strength, obtaining
stronger results: basic clustering properties which are rigorous when a Lieb-Robinson bound is
available, stronger properties based on hydrodynamic velocities obtained by a linear response
argument, and a still stronger clustering assumption from the superdiffusive phenomenology.
The latter will give lower bounds on the superdiffusive exponents, reproducing that of the KPZ
universality class and other exponents found in NFH.
We are looking for a natural space of quadratically extensive conserved charges for H, equivalently linearly extensive charges for H′ (as per the general definition (57)). Following the
explanation in the paragraph after Eq. (53), one can use the
R n one-parameter group of timeevolution τt in order to generate such charges: the sequence −n dt τt a is linearly extensive for
H′ because its support in time grows linearly. However, this is not so useful, as it requires an
explicit evaluation of time-integrated correlation functions as in (24), which is a difficult problem. Instead, we use the general construction and consider charges which are linearly extensive
for H′ (quadratically for H) because of a linear growth in space. Certainly, because of Point
3 (for H′ ), they still must be invariant under time translation, hence these must be conserved
charges.
A natural guess are the bilinear expressions in the total conserved charges, formally Qi Qj .
This closely resembles the quadratic expansion of the current made in [29], and I will establish
the full connection in Section 5. Defining precise objects in H′ , let me then consider the sequence
Z n
dx qi (x)qj ∈ H′ .
(68)
Qij;n = (1 − Pτ )
−n

The resulting charges will be referred to as “bilinear charges”, as they are formed of bilinear
expressions in linearly extensive charges for H.
In definition (68), the qi ’s are now seen as elements of V, the set of local observables, on
which there is an algebra. The result of the product is then seen as an element of H′ (that is,
its equivalence class is taken), and then the projection 1 − Pτ is applied on its integral.
As explained in Remark 2.1, such elements qi ∈ V are in general ambiguous, and are possibly
H′ -Cauchy sequences that are not H-converging, let alone converging in correlation functions.
In order to cure convergence problem, I assume that the basis qi for Hbal is formed of
H′ -equivalence classes of local observables. This means that V should be “large enough”. In
applications to integrable quantum chains, for instance, V may have to include observables
which are quasi-local, supported on infinitely-many sites but with appropriate decay properties
[31]. Indeed, in some chains, there are such observables that enter the basis of the space of
conserved densities, and that are not expressible as Cauchy sequences of strictly local conserved
18

densities. Strong clustering properties are still expected to hold on V. Likewise, I assume that
the conservation laws (20) hold, and that the currents ji are (equivalence classes of) elements
of V. It is shown in [20] that if V is large enough, then this can be done, and strong clustering
properties on V can still be imposed. The assumption that all densities qi are invariant under
(ℓ)
(ℓ)
higher flows (if any) τs , ℓ > 2 translates into similar statements with higher currents ji .
The ambiguity problem is not an actual problem, because we can just choose specific representatives qi ∈ V. However, it would be more satisfying if the resulting quadratically extensive
charge for H were independent of the choice of representatives. Assuming that the only ambiguities are constant shifts qi (x) 7→ qi (x) + a1 and gauge transformations qi (x) 7→ qi (x) + ∂x a(x)
(a ∈ V), it will be simple to see that this follows from the clustering properties I assume. Note
that the constant-shift ambiguity is immediately irrelevant: since Pτ qi = qi , we can replace qi by
qi − 1hqi i in (68). More simply, I will just assume in what follows that qi ’s have zero expectation
values hqi i = 0.
Finally, below the projection formula (21) is used, and assumed to converge, on local observables aV in correlation functions. At places, for notational convenience, the flux Jacobian is
also assumed to have discrete spectrum, and sums over normal modes are taken; but this is not
and essential assumption, and rather it is the locality of projected local observables Pτ a that is
important.

4.1

Diffusion from Lieb-Robinson-type correlations

I assume that there exists v > 0 such that, for all ai ∈ V,
ha1 (x1 , t1 )a2 (x2 , t2 ) · · ·ic → 0 as |xi − xj |, |ti − tj | → ∞, |xi − xj | ≥ v|ti − tj |

for some i 6= j (sufficiently fast, uniformly). (69)

If a Lieb-Robinson bound exists, with vLR the Lieb-Robinson velocity, we can take any v > vLR .
Here “sufficiently fast” is exponential if a Lieb-Robinson bound exists, but for the calculation
below, any high enough power law will suffice. Let me show that the sequence (Qij;n : n ∈ N)
satisfies Points 1, 2 and 3 (Subsection 3.1) of linearly extensive charges for H′ , with V ⊂ D(Q).
Point 1 for H′ is the requirement that ||Qij;n ||2H′ ≤ γn. We have, explicitly subtracting the
projection onto conserved densities,

where I used the diagonal
R basis described in Appendix A. The second term is finite as n → ∞
by clustering (69), as dx hqi (x)qj , qK iH′ = hQi Qj qK ic . Recall that we assume hqi i = 0, thus
the connected 3-point function appears. The first term in (70) can be written as

Here, the first term in the brackets gives a finite value as n → ∞ by clustering of the fourpoint function. The second term is a product of a function of z + x that decays fast enough
and integrates to hqi , qi iH′ , times a function of z − y that decays fast enough and integrates to
hqj , qj iH′ . Thus taking z ∼ y and z + x ∼ 0, there remains a single integral, on an interval of size
2n. As n → ∞, the leading contribution is therefore 2nhqi , qi iH′ hqj , qj iH′ . A similar analysis is
done for the second term, and we have

Note that this gives zero on a = ql (as it should since ||ql ||H′′ = 0). This implies that Qij;H′′ is
(ℓ)
invariant under all higher flows τs with ℓ > 2:

(75)
Qij;H′′ τs(ℓ) (a) = Qij;H′′ (a).

Finally, for Point 3, we use the fact that Qij;L is itself a “conserved quantity”, in the following
sense: from the conservation laws (20),

(76)

By the uniformity requirement of clustering in (69), we can choose any 0 < k ≤ 1/(2v) and
Point 3 holds. Indeed, for all times s1 , s2 in the interval [−n/(2v), n/(2v)], the observable a(t)
“covers” a region of length at most n, and in a connected three-point function with, for instance,
ji (x + n, 0)qj (x, 0), for every x, at least one of ji (x + n, 0) or qj (x, 0) lies outside this interval.
Therefore, the resulting map (74) is a quadratically extensive charge for H. Using (73) and
Theorem 3.1, and optimising the lower bound:

−
then the diagonal Onsager matrix element Lkk
is strictly positive (and may be infinite).

All quantities can be evaluated purely from the thermodynamics of the system. This implies nonzero diffusion whenever (79) holds. For instance, in a conventional Galilean gas, with
conserved mass Q0 and conserved momentum Q1 , sound wave diffusion in a thermal state may
be bounded by taking a = j0 (mass current) and i = 0, j = 1 (the quadratic charge formed out
of mass and momentum charges). This gives an explicit positive lower bound, solely derived
from clustering properties. By nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics, sound wave diffusion is in
fact expected to be infinite in many non-integrable systems, as there is superdiffusion; this is
discussed in Subsection 4.3.

4.2

Diffusion from hydrodynamic correlations

The Lieb-Robinson bound is rigorous, but it is not state dependent, and not optimal. In general,
one expects clustering (69) to hold for velocities v smaller than vLR , up to an optimal value that
is state-dependent; this value can be further optimised for certain observables. A natural guess is
that v in (69) and (78) can be set to the largest hydrodynamic velocity (the largest propagation
velocity of normal modes, see Appendix A).
In fact, one can derive a strong clustering statement by applying simple, if not entirely
rigorous, linear response arguments, of the type used in [38]. It is sufficient to concentrate on
three-point functions involving one observable in V and two conserved densities, and it is useful
to consider these conserved densities to be normal modes qI , qJ .
By the results (135) and (137) of Appendix D, at the Euler scale, local observables b and c
projects onto conserved densities in three-point functions h (1 − Pτ )a(x, t)b(y, 0)c(z, 0) ieul , and
conserved densities of normal modes propagate ballistically,
h (1 − Pτ )a(x, t)qI (y, 0)qJ (z, 0) ieul = hQI QJ (1 − Pτ )aic δ(x − y − vIeff t)δ(x − z − vJeff t).

(80)

As the currents of normal modes project diagonally, Pτ jI = vIeff qI , a similar formula hold with
currents instead of densities, for instance
h (1 − Pτ )a(x, t)jI (y, 0)qJ (z, 0) ieul = vIeff hQI QJ (1 − Pτ )aic δ(x − y − vIeff t)δ(x − z − vJeff t). (81)
The delta-functions arise from the Euler scaling; microscopic three-point functions are expected
to have support around these ballistic trajectories with power-law decay.
Therefore, I make the following clustering assumption (in addition to (69)): for all ǫ > 0,
and for b, c being densities or currents q, j, we have (using I1 = I, I2 = J)
h(1 − Pτ )a(x, t)bI1 (y1 , 0)cI2 (y2 , 0)ic → 0 as |x − yi |, |t| → ∞, |x − yi − vIeffi t| ≥ ǫt

for some i (sufficiently fast, uniformly). (82)

Here “sufficiently fast” should be qualified in view of the discussion of superdiffusion in Subsection 2.4. In the normal superdiffusion case, exponential decay, or decay with high enough power
21

law, away from the ballistic trajectory can be assumed. However, in the fat superdiffusion case,
by (43) one has much weaker power-law clustering in the region around the ballistic trajectory.

For instance, for two-point functions of conserved densities one has O |t| |x − yi − vIeffi t|−1−1/α ,
from (41) with (43). For two-point functions involving currents, powers of |t| decrease and of
|x − yi − vIeffi t| increase. Higher-point functions are subject to different power laws. For instance,
Euler scaling predicts one less power for every observable [38]. Based on this, for my purposes,
the clustering of three-point functions (82) is assumed with bounds by a sum of terms of the
forms


(83)
O |t|−ν |x − yi − vIeffi t|ν−1/α−1 ,
for possibly many values of ν ∈ R, around the ballistic trajectories; and exponential clustering,
or high enough power law, further away, as per (69). This appears the be the weakest assumption
for the theorems below; of course, exponential clustering, as expected around trajectories with
normal superdiffusion, satisfies this bound.
As the clustering bound (82) is stronger than (69), the proof of Subsection 4.1 holds true.
The only part that can be strengthened is the analysis of (77) for Point 3. As a consequence of
(82), one can choose 0 < k ≤ 1/(|vIeff − vJeff | + 2ǫ). In particular, (83) is strong enough for Point
3. Indeed, the contribution from such fat tails to (77) is obtained by integrating (83) over time
on an interval of length of order n (one may assume zero velocity), and then integrating over
space on an interval at distance n that is also of length of order n, because the fat tail is cut by
(69). The result is a power law n1−1/α (up to possible factors log(n)), which vanishes as n → ∞
for any α ∈ (1/2, 1). Thus, using ||qI ||2H′ = ||qJ ||2H′ = 1 and hqI , qJ iH′ = 0 and optimizing over
ǫ:
Theorem 4.2. Let a ∈ V. Under the assumption (82), with decay bounds of the form (83)
around the ballistic trajectories, we have

This implies that in these cases, wIJ are null in H′′ . This is at the root of divergent Onsager

Hscat = span{wIJ } ⊂ Hdif .

This is indeed a subspace of Hdif , as a consequence of (75). By symmetry, a basis is obtained
by considering I ≥ J and K ≥ L. With this, we may project onto Hscat , and we obtain a lower
bound for the matrix La,b defined in (24), and also for the Onsager matrix Lij constructed out

4.3

Superdiffusion

Theorem 4.2 implies that there is superdiffusion for the normal-mode current jK if hQ2I (1 −
Pτ )jK ic 6= 0 for some I. This condition is exactly that found from NFH [2] for superdiffusive
behaviours of normal modes: these coefficients are the “G-couplings” introduced in this context.
In NFH, a variety of superdiffusion exponents and scaling functions are found, depending
on which G-coupling is nonzero. In particular, it is found that if the fully diagonal coupling is
nonzero, hQ2I (1 − Pτ )jI ic 6= 0, then superdiffusion is within the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class, with exponent αI = 2/3. This is the case of sound modes in generic anharmonic
chains and other momentum conserving one-dimensional systems [2]. Further, using modecoupling theory, it is found that if the fully diagonal coupling is zero, hQ2K (1−Pτ )jK ic = 0, but a
partially diagonal coupling is nonzero, hQ2I (1−Pτ )jK ic 6= 0 for some KPZ-superdiffusive mode I,
then superdiffusion is controlled by the Lévy (α−1
K )-stable distribution, with exponent αK = 3/5.
This is the case of the heat mode in generic anharmonic chains [2]. More generally, it is argued
that if the nonzero couplings are a single fully diagonal one, hQ2I (1 − Pτ )jI ic 6= 0, at the root of a
sequence of nonzero partially diagonal ones, hQ2K (1 − Pτ )jK+1 ic 6= 0, K = I, I + 1, . . . , Kmax − 1,
then the superdiffusion scaling functions are Levy distribution with exponents obtained from
the Fibonacci sequence, see [26] for details.
I now propose a natural clustering property, inferred from the superdiffusion phenomenology,
under which the above description emerges naturally, without the need for the hydrodynamic
equation, mode-coupling theory or the addition of noise.
Recall the result (80), which follows from a linear response analysis. With I = J, we have
co-propagation of the normal modes, and this is at the basis of the divergence of the Onsager
matrix element in Theorem 4.2. However, as mentioned, the actual propagation of normal modes
is expected to lead, at least from the viewpoint of correlation functions, to a power-law extension
around the ballistic trajectory. That is, it is only away from this power-law expanding domain
that clustering can be applied. Thus, in addition to (69) and (82), I assume that, for every I,
there exists κ > 0 and u ∈ (1, 2) such that, for b, c being densities or currents q, j,
h(1 − Pτ )a(x, t)bI (y1 , 0)cI (y2 , 0)ic → 0 as |x − yi |, |t| → ∞, |x − yi − vIeff t| ≥ |κt|u−1

for some i (sufficiently fast, uniformly). (95)

I further make the following important assumption, which is suggested by the phenomenology
of superdiffusion: (95) holds for all
u > αI + 1
(96)
where αI is the superdiffusive exponent for mode I. Again, for “sufficiently fast”, the asymptotic
forms (83) (for α = αI ) are expected in the case where the mode I has fat superdiffusion, with
strong enough decay beyond as per (69).
With this, I show that the sequence QII;n , Eq. (68), is a u-extensive sequence on the observable a. According to Subsection 3.3, the derivation of Subsection 4.1 can be repeated without
24

change, up to the step where Point 3 is verified. Instead, we need to verify Point 3(u) of Subsection 3.3. We still obtain (77), but now, using (95), we find that indeed Point 3(u) holds (as
written for u ∈ (1, 2)), and we can take k = κ−1 21/(1−u) . In particular, (83) is strong enough for
Point 3(u) : integrating over t ∈ [−kn1/(u−1) , kn1/(u−1) ] (as required by Point 3(u) ), and then over
1/(u−1) ] (as required by (77) and using the bound (69) that cut the fat tail),
x − yi − vIeff t ∈ [n,
 n
1−1/α
I , possibly times factors log(n). This vanishes as n → ∞ for any α ∈ (1/2, 1).
gives O n
We obtain a u-extensive charge, acting as QH(u) (a) = hQ2I (1 − Pτ )aic . Theorem 3.2 then shows
that if this is nonzero for some current a = jK with normal (resp. fat) superdiffusion exponent
αK , then αK ≥ (3 − u)/2 (resp. αK ≥ 1/u). In combination with (96), and optimising, this
gives:
Theorem 4.3. Under assumptions (95) and (96), with decay bounds of the form (83) around
the ballistic trajectory:
A. If hQ2I (1−Pτ )jI ic 6= 0, and if jI has normal (resp. fat) superdiffusion exponent αI , Eq. (48)

resp. αK ≥

(98)

The sound modes discussed above have nonzero fully diagonal coupling. As the KPZ scaling
function has finite variance, the superdiffusion is normal. The lower bound in Point A, αI ≥ 2/3,
is then in agreement with the KPZ exponent 2/3, which saturates it. The heat mode discussed
above has zero fully diagonal coupling, but nonzero partially diagonal couplings to the sound
modes. As the Levy distribution has infinite variance, superdiffusion is fat in this case. The
lower bound in Point B, taking αI = 2/3, is then αK ≥ 3/5. This is again in agreement with the
superdiffusion exponent found in this case, the bound being saturated. More generally, taking
the sequence of nonzero couplings as discussed above, using the fact that the superdiffusion is
fat, and assuming the bound in Point B to be saturated, we have αK+1 = 1/(αK + 1), and this
reproduces the exponents based on the Fibonacci sequence [26].
Interestingly, we obtain strong statements concerning the relation between exponents and
tails of the distribution. For instance, we deduce that if the partially diagonal coupling of mode
K with mode I is nonzero, hQ2I (1 − Pτ )jK ic 6= 0, if mode I is of KPZ type, and if the exponent
of mode K is smaller than 2/3, as it is indeed observed to be (3/5 < 2/3), then the scaling
function of mode K must have divergent variance. This is indeed the case, as it is the Levy
distribution. This is a nontrivial consequence on the scaling function, inferred solely from the
associated exponent.
Note that one should expect the bounds to be saturated. Indeed, for instance, QH(u) (jI ) is
finite, and one would expect to be able to bound it as in (65) by a finite upper bound on the
optimal u; thus ||jI ||−
should be finite on this optimal u.
H(u)
It is also possible to argue for the KPZ lower bound in the normal superdiffusion case using
factionally extensive charges of the Prosen type, see Appendix G.
25

Remark 4.1. If (95) held for u = α + 1, then we could use this value in Theorem 3.2, and
apply it in order to obtain a bound on the strength of the superdiffusion spreading λ in Eq. (41).
However, I do not expect (95) to hold for u = α + 1, for any κ. Indeed, exactly on the curve
of the superdiffusion growth, there are corrections and clustering is not uniformly vanishing.
One might also hope to weaken Point 3(u) in order to include finite corrections, which might be
supported in small regions and therefore would give vanishing contributions to δn in (61) (here
replacing u by u − 1). However, although the nonzero correlations are only “near” the curve
of superdiffusion growth, I expect the extent of the spatial region on which they lie to grow with
the same power, as tu−1 . Therefore, the correction term δn receives nonvanishing contributions.
Hence, the techniques proposed here seem to be too rough to give bounds on the superdiffusion
strength.

Additional remarks
Maximal entropy states and hydrodynamic equation

The interpretation of Hbal and Hdif was, in Section 2, based on the identification of the Drude
weight and Onsager matrix with inner products on the respective spaces. Here I make a more
direct connection with the hydrodynamic equation itself.
(ℓ)
The state h· · ·i has up to now been assumed to be invariant under the flows τs , including
space and time translations, and to have appropriate clustering properties, Eq. (6) and the
various clustering assumptions in Section 4. A natural set of such states are those which have
maximised
with respect to
P entropy
R all available conserved charges. They are formally of the
iQ
−
β
i
i
form e
, where again Qi = dx qi (x) are the total conserved charges. A better definition
is that the thermodynamic potentials β i generate a flow on the set of states, defined by the
equation
∂
h· · ·i = hQi · · ·i − hQi ih· · ·i.
(99)
−
∂β i
This can be taken as the starting point for a rigorous construction of the states, see [19]. These
maximal entropy states include Gibbs and generalised Gibbs states. An immediate consequence
is that variations in Hth are related to overlaps in Hbal :
−

∂hai
= hqi , aiH′ = hqi , aiHbal .
∂β i

(100)

Note in particular that the thermodynamic potentials β i are defined in a gauge-invariant fashion
(they do not depend on the specific choice of qi as an element of H).
Within this formulation, one can write the hydrodynamic equations in an elegant form that
makes clear the role of Hbal and Hdif . Recall that the hydrodynamic equation is an equation
for how the state h· · ·ix,t depends on x, t, in the manifold of maximal entropy states. Using the
state coordinates β i (x, t), up to diffusive scales, a form of the hydrodynamic equation is

1
Cij ∂t β j + Bij ∂x β j = ∂x Lij ∂x β j .

26

(101)

u=

qi ∂t β i , v =

X

ji ∂x β i ,

(102)

i

where ballistic and diffusive terms are described by the ballistic and diffusive Hilbert spaces. In
particular, the Euler equation is an equation on Hbal ,
u+v=0

(on Hbal , at the Euler scale).

At the diffusive scale, the total hydrodynamic entropy production can be written as
Z
1
∂t S =
dx ||v||2dif ,
2

(103)

(104)

which is obviously non-negative. The diffusive Hilbert space also gives a measure of the distance
of a space-time configuration to the Euler equation, for instance
Z x2

dx hu + v, qi ibal ≤ (N[x1 ,x2 ] + 1) max ||v||dif ||ji ||dif
(105)
[x1 ,x2 ]

x1

where N[x1 ,x2 ] is the number of extrema of hv, ji idif in the open interval (x1 , x2 ).
The hydrodynamic equation (102) is written in an explicitly gauge-invariant form: the inner
products are gauge invariant, and the state coordinates β i also are. Thus, even up to diffusive
scale, the hydrodynamic equation is universal: it does not depend on the choice of the conserved
densities qi as elements of H. In order to extract physical information from (102), however, one
must provide a map from β i to averages of local observables in space-time. This map is not
universal; in general, one chooses a set of densities qi in H and the map is completely fixed by
requiring hqi (x, t)i = hqi ix,t .

5.2

Two-body wave scattering and geometry of the manifold of states

Recall Equation (100) relating β i -derivatives of averages hai to inner products in Hbal . It has a
clear geometrical meaning, obtained by seeing an observable a as a function on the manifold of
states. In symbols, if ω ∈ M are the maximal entropy states, we may see, for any given a ∈ V,
the average hai = a(ω) as a function of the state ω. Then, (100) is an equation for the derivative
of this function with respect to β i . Thus we should identify Hbal with the tangent space at ω,
and qi with a basis of tangent vectors. In particular, on the right-hand side of (100), a ∈ Hbal
is the abstract vector field that is the derivative of the function a(ω). The static covariance
matrix Cij is the metric of this Riemannian manifold. Thus, according to the results of Section
3, the tangent space is the space of linearly extensive conserved charges for H. This, I believe,
gives some clarification to the sense in which linearly extensive conserved charges, as used in the
literature on GGEs, are indeed those that generate the maximal entropy states.
Two natural questions arise: if variations in Hth give overlaps in Hbal , then do variations in
Hbal give overlaps in Hdif ? And, having a Riemannian manifold, could we construct covariant
derivatives? These questions are related. The covariant derivatives can be constructed explicitly

(109)

We recognise the right-hand side of (108) as (up to a minus sign) the action of the bilinear
charge Qij;H′′ constructed in Subsection 4.1, see Eq. (74). That is, the covariant derivative is,
on the vector field a, a quadratically extensive conserved charge for H. Thus, by the results
of Section 3, the space of covariant derivatives (the tangent space to the tangent space) is a
subspace of Hdif ; it is the wave scattering space Hscat spanned by the bilinear charges, Eq. (91).
The remark that covariant derivatives must lie in Hdif also has a geometric underpinning.
Since the metric is covariant, ∇i hqj , qk ibal = 0. Therefore, seeing the left-hand side of (108) as a
linear functional on a, it is null on Hbal . This suggests the hydrodynamic reduction H′ → H′′ ,
which trivialises Hbal . Further, it is clear from (108) that it is invariant under time evolution
τt . Hence, it acts well on the space of equivalence classes on which H′′ is built. The result of
Subsection 4.1 is of course stronger, showing that, as a linear functional on a, the covariant
derivative is in fact bounded with respect to H′′ .
The covariant derivative suggests the definition of a bilinear map

such that
In general, this maps onto a subspace of Hdif ,

(112)

Recall from Subsection 4.2 that these elements of Hscat are explicitly given, in the diagonal basis

The limit in X is to be taken within H′′ , that is, one evaluates this limit after taking the limit
over time in the second equation in (13). The expression within the limit in (113) is a Cauchy
sequence within this Hilbert space, and it is the limit that gives an element of Hscat . Also recall
that (see (90))
(114)
||φscat (qI , qI )||H′′ = 0,
and thus indeed the diagonal of Hbal ⊗ Hbal is omitted in the domain of φscat . It is also shown
in Subsection 4.2 that
hφscat (qI , qJ ), φscat (qK , qL )idif = |vIeff − vJeff |δIK δJL

(I > J, K > L).

(115)

Therefore the set of all these elements φscat (qI , qJ ), with I > J, such that the normal mode
velocities differ, vIeff 6= vJeff , form an orthogonal basis for Hscat .
Recall that qI as an element of H is defined up to constant shifts qI (x) 7→ qI (x) + a1 and
gauge transformations qI (x) 7→ qI (x) + ∂x a(x). Thus in order for the map (113) to be well
defined, we must verify that the result is invariant under these transformation. This is indeed
the case: since qI ≡ 0 in H′′ , then the constant shift leaves the expression invariant; and the
gauge transformation produces, in the integral, boundary terms which are finite in H′′ , hence
their contribution vanishes in the limit X → ∞.
I call φscat the wave scattering map. An interpretation of it is as follows. The elements
φscat (qI , qJ ) represent hydrodynamic two-body scattering states for ballistic waves, where two
interacting, coherent, ballistic waves propagate. The average over space x in (113) represents
the average over all distances between the waves. The factor |vIeff − vJeff | relates to a “density of
state”: the normalisation factor by which we divide the integral in (113) is not the total distance
2X between the observables, but the total time required for them to reach a distance 2X under
ballistic propagation. The fact that the product of conserved densities, in appropriate correlation
functions, are coherently and ballistically transported is expressed mathematically in Formula
(137) in Appendix D, which is derived from the linear response ideas of [38]. The range Hscat of
the map is the wave scattering subspace of Hdif . The overlaps (111), which are geometrically the
covariant derivatives, represent the “probability amplitudes” for the wave scattering state to be
created by the perturbation a. Physically, it can be interpreted in terms of the spreading of the
observable a as it evolves: it is the strength of ballistically propagating coherent pulses of modes
I and J at the fronts. In general, the spreading is formed of a linear combination of many such
fronts. Finally, one may interpret the part of the hydrodynamic entropy production (104) due
to wave scattering Hscat (coming from the part of ||v||dif obtained by projection onto Hscat ) as
that coming from a redistribution of large-scale convective structures towards structures at the
lower diffusive scale.
Applied to the Onsager matrix, with a = ji and b = jj , the lower bound (92) represents the
contribution to diffusion from the scattering of ballistic waves. The projection hφscat (qI , qJ ), ji idif
29

is the amplitude for the current observables to absorb or produce two coherent ballistic waves,
and the denominator represents the amplitude of overlap between the waves.
The expression for Lijscat = Ljscat
from (92) agrees with the formula obtained in [29] from
i ,jj
a proposal akin to nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics. It is worth explaining the relation
between the formalism of this work and that developed here; I believe my derivation provides a
number of clarifications which may be useful for future studies.
First, the heuristic expansion of the current observable in powers of density observables has
the more precise meaning of an expansion within the Hilbert space Hscat . Hence, the proposal
in [29] is valid as an exact formula for observables that lie within Hscat . It is important to note
that ji generically does not lie within this space, and thus there are corrections, as anticipated
in [29]. From the theory developed here, one can further establish that corrections are present
for any observable a ∈ H′′ that is not invariant under the higher flows, as these do not lie in
Hdif .
Second, the heuristic arguments given in [29] for the ballistic propagation of two normal
modes, which is crucial in order to relate space-integrals to time-integrals, is shown here to arise
from the linear-response formula proven in Appendix D. This states how products of conserved
densities in three-point functions can be evolved according to their ballistic transport. Crucially,
this shows that one needs to project out the conserved space in order for this ballistic transport
formula to hold, clarifying why the projection has to be performed in [29].
scat is seen in the present work as arising from a projection
Finally, the formula (92) for La,b
on a Hilbert space. This shows that this formula gives in general a lower bound. This is
important, for instance, in order to fully justify, as in Theorem 4.2, the argument made in [29]
that superdiffusion must occur – diffusion is infinite – if (in my notation) hwII , aiH′′ 6= 0.

5.3

Integrability

This section is more speculative and concerns the relation between many-body integrability and
the structure of the Hilbert spaces discussed above.
The classical notion of integrability is based on the Liouville condition, that the number
of commuting conserver quantities must agree with the number of conservation laws. This
leads to the well known solution by quadrature of the system. The extension of this concept
to thermodynamic systems, which possess infinitely-many degrees, such as the thermodynamic
limit of quantum or classical gases, or field theories, is a challenging problem. Is the presence of
infinitely-many conserved quantities sufficient for integrability? The problem is even starker in
quantum chains: in finite volumes, there always are as many conserved quantities in involution
as the dimension of the quantal Hilbert space: the projectors on the Hamiltonian eigenspaces.
How should we define, without recourse to any particular technical solution procedures, the
notion of integrability in infinite chains?
A basis for the answer to these questions has been suggested for a long time: one must consider conserved charges with appropriate locality properties. The Hilbert spaces constructed in
this paper, and in particular the results [20] on Euler-scale hydrodynamic projections, formalise
the notion of locality in a mathematically precise fashion. Thus it is natural to ask if we can
define integrability using these. Here I propose that this is the case.
First, one can verify, as is shown in [29], that the expression for Lijscat from (92) reproduces
30

the exact result of [10, 11] for the Onsager matrix Lij in integrable models. Hence, in integrable
models, the wave scattering bound is saturated
Lij = Lijscat

(integrable systems).

(116)

This observation is in agreement with the interpretation of the calculation in [10, 11], which used
a spectral decomposition of the current-current two-point function in terms of matrix elements of
particle and holes excitations above a finite-density Bethe background. In this calculation, it is
indeed seen that only the 2-particle-hole-pair terms in the spectral decomposition contribute to
the Onsager matrix, the result being interpreted as a two-body scattering process. The partial
expansion formula (92) is a generalisation to arbitrary many-body models of this calculation
and of its underlying physical interpretation.
One might want to define integrable systems by the requirement that their diffusion be
solely due to wave scattering states. I propose that this observation in fact points to a more
fundamental definition of integrability in terms of its space of conserved charges. Recall the
setup of Subsection 2.2, in particular the higher flows and their invariants (14). Recall that the
wave scattering space – the space of covariant derivatives – is a subspace of the diffusive space,
Hscat ⊂ Hdif ,

(117)

itself invariant under all higher flows (if any), Hdif = Q ′′ . Clearly, if there is only a finite number
of conserved flows, then Hdif is relatively big, while Hscat is relatively small. The extreme case is
if ι and τ are the only flows; then Hdif = H′′ while Hscat is composed of a single element w12 . As
the number of conserved quantities increase, the space Hdif decreases and Hscat increases: the
conserved quantities restrict diffusion, but increase the wave scattering contributions within it.
Thus, with enough conserved quantities, the spaces may become equal. Therefore I propose the
following definition: a many-body system is integrable if and only if there are enough conserved
flows in involution such that
Hscat = Hdif

(definition of integrability).

(118)

That is, in integrable systems, once the complete set of conserved densities {qi } has been found
at the ballistic level, giving Hbal ⊂ H′ and generating conserved flows in involution, then at the
diffusive level, in Hdif ⊂ H′′ , there are no new conserved degrees of freedom. The geometric
meaning is that not only the tangent space of the state manifold generates the space of flow
invariants in the first-order hydrodynamic space H′ , but also the covariant derivatives generate
the space of flow-invariants in the second-order hydrodynamic space H′′ .
This definition immediately explains why the wave scattering subspace saturates diffusion,
Eq. (116). Indeed, as mentioned current observables are in general invariant under higher flows,
hence elements of the diffusive subspace Hdif , Eq. (26). As a consequence, the definition (118)
implies that in integrable systems
ji ∈ Hscat as an element of Hdif
and this immediately implies (116).
31

(integrable systems)

(119)

This proposal appears to be supported by the form factor calculations of [11]. Performing a
similar calculation for an arbitrary observable instead of currents, one obtains an infinite series,
not only the two particle-hole terms (I refer to [11] for the discussion of particle-hole states).
However, requiring that the observable be in Hdif , hence invariant under all higher flows (as
an element of H′′ , not as a local observable, which would be too strong), all processes in this
series must conserved momenta. As only two integrals are made (over space and time), it must
be that only the two particle-hole terms remain, and therefore the inner product involving this
observable in Hdif can be projected onto Hscat .
Finally, it is also possible to describe free systems. I note three proposal or sets of results
which I now put together. First, it is proposed in [39] that the difference between free and
interacting integrable models is that in the former, diffusion vanishes, while in the latter it does
not. Second, it is proposed in [40] that free models are exactly those for which the natural flux
Jacobian4 Ai j = ∂hji i/∂hqj i, is independent of the state. Third, it is shown [41] in a large class
of spin chain models with “free-particle” description that there is a choice of gauge (a choice
of explicit conserved densities and currents in the spin chain) such that the current operators
is itself a conserved density. I now show that these statements, along with the proposal (118),
agree with the following definition of free models:
ji = 0 as an element of Hdif

(definition of free systems)

(120)

Indeed, if, in an appropriate gauge, current observables are conserved densities, then ji ∈ Hbal
as elements of H′ . As a consequence, since Hbal → {0} in the hydrodynamic reduction to the
diffusive space, (120) holds. Another way of seeing this is that if the natural flux Jacobian is
state-independent, then the diagonal basis in Appendix A is state-independent, and therefore
hwIJ , jj iH′′ = 0, from Eq. (74). Hence, Pscat ji = 0, and combined with my proposal for integrability (118) that ji ∈ Hscat , this gives (120). Clearly, with (120), the Onsager matrix vanishes,
in agreement with the proposal [39].

Conclusion

I have described a procedure for constructing certain Hilbert spaces which give information
about the hydrodynamic properties of a many-body system. This is a general procedure, which
generalises the standard setup of ballistic hydrodynamic projections. In particular, I have defined
the second order hydrodynamic space H′′ , in which the diffusive Hilbert space lies Hdif ⊂ H′′ .
The diffusive space is the space of invariants under higher Hamiltonian flows, if there are any
such flows (such as in integrable systems); otherwise it is all of H′′ . I have explained how the
Onsager matrix, describing diffusion, is written as an inner product in Hdif . I have also defined
fractional-order spaces H(u) , and those lying between the ballistic and diffusive spaces, u ∈ (1, 2),
are associated with superdiffusion.
I have shown that quadratically extensive conserved charges give elements of H′′ . The
construction gives a slightly different, and stronger, version of the lower bound for diffusion
4

The natural flux Jacobian is that obtained in any system of coordinates, on the manifold of maximal entropy
states, that is linear in the average conserved densities hqi i. For instance, in general, the system formed by the
normal modes at every point on the manifold is nonlinear. See [40].

32

found by Prosen [7]. I have explained how one can write a hydrodynamic projection formula
for the Onsager matrix which extends such lower bounds to a formally exact expression, much
like standard hydrodynamic projections for the Drude weights [1, 18] extend the Mazur bound
[21, 22, 23, 24, 25] based on linearly extensive charges.
I have constructed particular elements of Hdif associated to bilinear expressions in linearly
extensive conserved charges. Their contribution to diffusion describes the effects of the scattering
of ballistic waves; their overlaps with local observables can be interpreted as representing the
ballistic fronts of observable spreading. These elements span what I call the wave scattering
space Hscat ⊂ Hdif . Geometrically, they describe the covariant derivatives on the manifold of
maximal entropy states.
The action of bilinear charges are completely calculable by the knowledge of the averages
of local observables. They give rise to explicit lower bounds for the Onsager matrix, whose
strength depends on the clustering properties of three-point functions. Using solely clustering
of the Lieb-Robinson type, I show that nonzero diffusion can be established from the evaluation of an integrated three-point function, available from the thermodynamic averages of
currents. Using an Euler-scale linear response principle, I have obtained expressions for threepoint functions involving conserved densities, which suggest sharper clustering properties based
on hydrodynamic propagation velocities. These sharper clustering properties imply a stronger
diffusion lower bounds. Further, from the three-point function result, the full projection onto
Hscat is evaluated, giving a matrix lower bound. This matrix lower bound agrees with that
conjectured recently using different, less rigorous methods [29], and is saturated in integrable
models [10, 11, 12].
Assuming that clustering is controlled by hydrodynamic velocities, I have shown that if
the diagonal G-coupling of nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics (NFH) is nonzero, then there
must be superdiffusion (the associated Onsager matrix element is infinity). Assuming clustering
properties inferred from the general superdiffusion phenomenology further implies that the superdiffusive exponent is bounded from below by 2/3 if the scaling function has finite variance,
the exponent of the KPZ universality class. I likewise bound the heat-mode exponent by 3/5
and recover the Fibonacci sequence predicted in the context of NFH. These are obtained without
the use of the hydrodynamic equation, and without adding noise or using mode-coupling theory,
and give a strong confirmations of results from NFH.
I have speculated that an accurate definition of integrability can be obtained by the coincidence of Hscat with Hdif : with enough conserved quantities in involution, diffusion is limited
enough, yet there is enough wave scattering, so that diffusion is purely from scattering of ballistic
waves. This parallels the usual statement that integrability is the presence of as many conserved
quantities in involution as degrees of freedom. I noted that generically, observables, in integrable
and non-integrable systems, are not supported on the wave scattering subspace, this being a particularity of current observables in integrable systems. Generic observables therefore have more
involved spreading structure. In free models, current observables are null in the diffusive space,
hence there is no diffusion.
Adding the complementary space H1 within the diffusive space, Hdif = Hscat ⊕ H1 , and H2
within the second order hydrodynamic space, H′′ = Hdif ⊕ H2 , we have
H′′ = Hscat ⊕ H1 ⊕ H2 .
33

(121)

The spaces H1 and H2 will be studied in forthcoming works. Here I point out that one might get
insight by considering the various hydrodynamic structures that may form besides ballistically
propagating waves. For instance, in general, shocks may develop, which will contribute to
diffusion. This points to the idea of constructing asymptotic hydrodynamic states based on
such structures, giving rise to hydrodynamic spectral decompositions of multi-point functions
paralleling the form factor expansion in integrable models [42, 11, 43].
A particular family of fluid equations, of which the hydrodynamics of integrable systems
is part, is that of linearly degenerate fluids, see [44, 45, 46, 47]. Linearly degenerate fluids do
not develop shocks, and one might therefore conjecture that they admit purely wave scattering
diffusion. It would be interesting to study wave scattering processes in linearly degenerate
hydrodynamics, and understand how they connect with integrable systems in more depth.
The sequential construction (16) points to the possibility of studying finer hydrodynamic
scales when higher flows are available (such as in integrable systems). Effectively, in the hydrodynamic equation probing the finer scales, at the nth stage of the sequence, one expands
the dispersion relation of the nth flow to the nth power of momentum, as the lower powers are
projected out by the lower stages. There is no need to choose the sequence of flows in any particular order (for instance, any flow of the hierarchy can be used for generating time evolution),
but in certain situations, it may be natural to order the flows by the power of momentum they
correspond to (for instance, in Galilean systems the momentum is p, the energy p2 /2, and other
linearly extensive conserved charges of integrable systems carry higher powers of p). Naturally,
extending (57), these higher spaces should be spanned by charges of higher-order extensivity.
Importantly, the construction suggests that there are as many meaningful hydrodynamic scales
as there are commuting flows; in particular, in conventional, non-integrable systems (N = 2),
this suggests that there are no hydrodynamic scales beyond the diffusive scale: the hydrodynamic
assumption that conserved densities on time slices fully describe the local averages is broken. In
integrable systems (N = ∞), there are infinitely many hydrodynamic scales, supposedly forming
an asymptotic expansion of local averages.
Fractional-order spaces H(u) may also be nontrivial for orders u ∈ (0, 1), that is, lying
between the thermodynamic and ballistic spaces. In one dimension, thermal states for local
quantum-chain hamiltonians are exponentially clustering, hence such fractional spaces are trivial.
However, at zero temperature, there may be quantum phase transitions, where clustering is
power-law and spaces of fractional orders between 0 and 1 should become nontrivial. Hence, at
orders u ∈ (0, 1), nontrivial fractional order spaces are associated with quantum criticality, and
at orders u ∈ (1, 2), they are associated with superdiffusion, which can be argued to correspond
to dynamical phase transitions [40].
Finally, it is clear that, as for the linearly extensive charges [19], most aspects of the present
theory can be generalised to higher-dimensional models, where it would be interesting to connect
with proposed general results, e.g. [48].

is the inverse of the matrix Cij . By general principles [2, 9, 11, 49], Bij = Bji , implying

The matrix Cij is like a “metric”, used to raise and lower indices.
It is known that one can diagonalise the flux Jacobian A,
A = R−1 v eff R

(124)

where v eff = diag(vIeff ) is the diagonal matrix of normal-mode velocities of the Euler
dynamics of the model. The columns of the matrix R−1 are the eigenvectors of A.
eigenvectors can be chosen to form an orthonormal basis with respect to the form given
matrix C−1 , and therefore we can choose R to satisfy

Currents as invariants

This is based on Subsection 2.3. It is sufficient to consider the infinitesimal generators of the
flows, Qℓ . By (14), all conserved quantities Qi ’s are conserved with respect to all flows. Then, in
H′ , we have Pτ ([Qℓ , a]) = 0 because h[Qℓ , a]Qi ic = 0. Further, every flow generates its currents,
(ℓ)
so that [Qℓ , qi ] = ∂x ji . Hence, we have

Superdiffusive scaling of current correlation functions

Consider the form (41) of the two-point function of the normal modes qI (x, t). I will show that
this implies (44) for the two-point function of the associated current jI (x, t). For normal modes,
as the flux Jacobian has been diagonalised, (1 − Pτ )jI = jI − vIeff qI . It is sufficient to assume
vIeff = 0, which simplifies the calculation.

Hydrodynamic projections for three-point functions

Euler-scale correlation functions ha1 (x1 , t1 )a2 (x2 , t2 ) · · · ax (xn , tn )ieul are connected correlation
functions of local observables at large space-time scales,
lim λ−n+1 ha1 (λx1 , λt1 )a2 (λx2 , λt2 ) · · · an (λxn , λtn )ic ,

λ→∞

where ai (λxi , λti ) are averages over “fluid cells” of extent o(λ) around the space-time points
(λxi , λti ). Fluid cell averaging may be done in a variety of ways, see for instance the discussion
in [1] and in [38, 50]. Euler-scale correlation functions may be evaluated by the linear-response
principles proposed in [38]. Here, I show two fundamental formula for Euler-scale three-point
correlation functions using linear response arguments. The first result is
h (1 − P)a(x, t) b(y, 0) c(z, 0) ieul = h (1 − P)a(x, t) Pb(y, 0) Pc(z, 0) ieul

(135)

where here and below P = Pτ . Thus, upon projecting out conserved densities at (x, t), the
only contribution from observables at time 0 come from their projection on the conserved densities.
Recall that the projection is with respect to the inner product ha, bi := ha, biH′ =
R
dx ha(x)b(0)ic , and is written explicitly as (21):
X
Pa =

The second formula is

(137)

where the three-point coupling is
hb, qi , qj i =

Z

dydz hb(0)qi (y)qj (z)ic .

(138)

That is, upon projecting out conserved densities at x, t, conserved densities at y, 0 and z, 0 can
brought to time t by their Euler-scale propagators, and the overlap with the observable at x, t
is the three-point coupling. Recall that, at the Euler scale

Proof. A proof for (135) and (137) is as follows. Consider the average ha(x, t)i as evolved from
an inhomogeneous initial state. By linear response [38], one can insert the Euler-cell averages
of b(y, 0) and c(z, 0) by deformation of their conjugate thermodynamic in the initial condition,
β a (y) and β b (z), respectively. We evaluate the final result in the homogeneous, stationary
state (the latter is not necessary for the general linear response argument, but sufficient for our
purposes). This gives:

We evaluate the derivative by applying it to each factor, and then specialising to the stationary

the term
ha(x, t)c(z, 0), qi iCij hqj (x, t)b(y, 0)ieul .
(142)

On the term Cijx,t , the inverse of the matrix C, we use the rule of differentiation of inverse
matrices and obtain similarly
− ha, qi iCij hqj (x, t)c(z, 0), qk iCkl hql (x, t)b(y, 0)ieul .

(143)

Using (136), the result is
h (1 − P)a(x, t) b(y, 0) c(z, 0) ieul = h (1 − P)a(x, t) c(z, 0), qi iCij hqj (x, t)b(y, 0)ieul .

(144)

Specialising to b(y, 0) = qk (y, 0), this gives
h (1 − P)a(x, t) c(z, 0) qk (y, 0) ieul = h (1 − P)a(x, t) c(z, 0), qi iSi k (x − y, t).
Specialising to c(z, 0) = ql (z, 0), and applying (145) to h(1 − P)a(x, t)c(z, 0), qi i =

Representation of bilinear charges

Using the matrix notation, let us introduce the projected three-point coupling symmetric matrix
Maij = h(1 − P)a, qi , qj i

(148)

where here and below P = Pτ , as well as the Euler-scale correlation matrix
Eaij (x, y, t) h (1 − P)a(0, 0) qi (x, t) qj (y, t) ieul .

(149)

Ea (x, y, t) = ST (x, t)Ma S(y, t)

(150)

Then, from (137),
where we used space-time reversal symmetry. Diagonalising the flux Jacobian as (124) we get
Ea (x, y, t) = ST (x, t)Ma S(y, t)
= R−1 δ(x − v eff t)RMa RT δ(y − v eff t)R−T
Since

Prosen’s quadratically extensive charges

For definiteness I take again the situation of Subsection 2.2, with ιx and τt the space and time
translations; however the construction is rather general.
Prosen introduced in [7] charges which grow quadratically with the length of the region
on which they are supported, and showed that they led to a lower bound for diffusion. The
quadratically extensive charges defined in Subsection 3.2 are not exactly of the same type. Here
I discuss Prosen’s construction, but now interpreted via the Hilbert space structures I have
introduced. I reproduce a diffusion bound that is slightly stronger than that obtained in [7],
and that agrees with the bounds one can obtain from the charges of Subsection 3.2.
ι
Here, the condition of projection at infinity (or clustering) (6), used sequentially for H → H′ ,
ι
and then for H′ → H′′ , as it is in Subsection 3.2, is not quite strong enough. Instead, a stronger
condition is needed: a projection at infinity that is uniform with respect to both ιx and τt
h(1 − Pτ )(1 − Pι )a(x, t), biH → 0

sufficiently fast and uniformly as |x|, |t| → ∞

(a, b ∈ V).
(160)
′
Of course, in my original construction, Pι acts on H, but Pτ acts on H . Here and below,
however, we need to consider both acting on H. For this purpose, we select a representative
in H of the H′ -equivalence class for each conserved density qi (as discussed in Section 4), and
apply the basic formula (21). The results below are independent of the choice of representative.
By the usual hydrodynamic projection arguments, projecting out the conserved quantities as in
(160) indeed should make the correlator vanish in all of space-time fast enough.
Consider a sequence Q = (Qn ∈ V : n ∈ N) of elements of V ⊂ H. Assume, without loss of
generality, that Qn = (1 − Pτ )(1 − Pι )Qn .
Suppose the sequence satisfies the following conditions:
1′ . There exists γ > 0 such that ||Qn ||2H < γn2 for all n ∈ N.
2′ . The limit QH′′ (a) := limn→∞ hQn , aiH exists for all a ∈ V.
3′ . There exists k > 0 and v+ > v− ∈ R such that limn→∞ sup(x,t),(y,s)∈Dn,k,v ,v |hQn , a(x, t)−
− +
a(y, s)iH | = 0 for all a ∈ V, where
n
Dn,k,v− ,v+ = (x, t) : −kn + v+ t < x < kn + v− t, |t| <

2kn o
.
v+ − v−

(161)

Condition 1′ is the quadratic extensivity. Condition 2′ is the usual requirement of the existence
of the limit action. Condition 3′ is the requirement of space-time translation invariance. The
special (possibly slanted) diamond shape of the domain Dn,k,v− ,v+ is from the intuition that Qn
is essentially homogeneous and time-independent on an interval [−kn, kn], but under evolution,
the effect of its boundary points moves within the interval; the left (right) boundary point move
at velocity v+ (v− ). This is the picture of quadratically extensive “almost” conserved charges
considered by Prosen (see [7, Fig. 1]). The terminology “almost” was used because of the motion
of the boundary points. However this motion is generic, and the result (the limit action of Point
2’) is truly time-translation invariant; hence I find there is no need for the adverb “almost”.
40

In quantum spin chains, or whenever a Lieb-Robinson bound exists, typically one can take
any
v+ = −v− > vLR ,

vLR the Lieb-Robinson velocity.

(162)

vLR represents the maximal velocity of propagation of local disturbances as set by the dynamics.
The Lieb-Robinson velocity is not state dependent, but for a given state it is generically an overestimate of the actual propagation velocities. It is natural to assume that it is the spectrum
of the flux Jacobian (see Appendix A) that describes all relevant velocities, much as I did in
Subsection 4.2, although this is hard to make rigorous for any given sequence Q. Under this
hydrodynamic picture, one may take any
v− < inf(v eff ),

v+ > sup(v eff )

(hydrodynamic picture),

(163)

and this ultimately gives stronger bounds.
Note that with the uniform clustering condition (160), the inner product (13) on H′′ can be
written as
Z
dxdt h(1 − Pτ )(1 − Pι )a(x, t), biH
(164)
ha, biH′′ = lim
n→∞ nD

for any bounded open domain D ∈ R2 containing 0, and a formula similar to (9) holds:

(165)

We need to prove that QH′′ is bounded with respect to H′′ . The proof of boundedness is
similar to the case of linearly extensive charges. By Point 3′ , there exists k > 0, v+ > v− ∈ R,
and δn > 0 with limn→∞ δn = 0, such that
Z
v+ − v−
dxdt hQn , (1 − Pτ )(1 − Pι )a(x, t)iH + δn

4k2 n2 Dn,k,v
where I used |Dn,k,v− ,v+ | = 4k2 n2 /(v+ − v− ). The first term on the right-hand side is bounded
by using the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality:

||b||H′′ ≤
QH′′ (a) = hb, aiH′′ ∀ a ∈ V,

2k

(168)

(169)

Using known space-time uniformity of correlation functions in order to establish Point 3′ ,
and in particular quantifying the clustering property (160), the result (169) and (168), with
41

(162), can be expressed in a quite rigorous fashion in quantum spin chains; see the arguments
in [7].
Therefore we obtain a statement that parallels (59),
La,a ≥

4k2
|QH′′ (a)|2 .
(v+ − v− )γ

(170)

With a Lieb-Robinson bound, (162), in the second line, v+ = −v− = vLR (taking the limit over
all bounds for La,a ). With the hydrodynamic picture (163), in the second line we can instead
set v− = inf(v eff ), v+ = sup(v eff ).
Let me make the connection with Prosen’s bound (obtained in the context of quantum chains)
more explicit. Following Prosen, I assume that there is no ballistic transport, hence Pτ = 0,
which simplifies the discussion. Prosen requires a sequence (Qn ) such that limn→∞ hQn aic exists,
which is quadratically growing, hQ2n ic ≤ γn2 for some γ > 0. Without loss of generality, Qn is
hermitian, and n represents the length of the interval on which Qn is supported. Prosen assumes
Qn to be almost homogeneous (homogeneous except near the boundaries of the support), and
almost conserved (the time derivative only involves terms at the boundaries of the support).
These requirements can be seen to satisfy the three points 1′ , 2′ and 3′ above. With strong
enough clustering (for instance, exponential) and v+ > v− ∈ R the maximal and minimal
propagation velocities, then in (170) we take k = 1/2, and we havex
|hQn aic |2
.
n→∞ (v+ − v− )γ

La,a ≥ lim

(171)

where I use the explicit form QH′′ (a) = limn→∞ hQn aic .
This is an improvement on the bound found in [7] in two ways. First, with the Lieb-Robinson
bound, the denominator is 2vLR γ. This is a stronger bound than that with factor 8 instead of 2
found in [7]. The difference can be traced back to the use of a reduced volume of integration in
[7], instead of the full diamond Dn,k,v− ,v+ . Second, the hydrodynamic velocities are bounded by
the Lieb-Robinson velocity |v+ | < vLR and |v− | < vLR . Thus, within the hydrodynamic picture,
the result is stronger.

G

Superdiffusion bound from Prosen-type charges

I show that one may obtain the superdiffusion bound os Subsection 4.3 by using instead the
Prosen-type charges of Appendix F.
The form (41) also suggests that we define an α′ -sequence (Qn ∈ V), for α′ > 0, as one that
satisfies Points 1′ and 2′ of Appendix F, as well as the following space-time invariance condition:
3′′ . There exists k > 0 and λ > 0 such that limn→∞ sup(x,t),(y,s)∈Dn,k,λ |hQn , a(x, t)−a(y, s)iH | =
0 for all a ∈ V, where
o

′
Dn,k,λ = (x, t) : −kn + |λt|α < x < kn − |λt|α , |λt| < (kn)1/α .
42

(172)

The region Dn,k,λ is an elongated, curvy diamond, whose sides are power-law curves with power
α′ . This is simply the region where we would expect space-time invariance for the Prosen-type
charge generated by the sequence
hZ n
i2
QII;n = (1 − Pτ )(1 − Pι )
dx qI (x) .
(173)
−n

Indeed, its boundaries should move at the velocity vIeff = 0 (assumed to vanish for simplicity) but
extend superdiffusively, and uniformity in space-time is only expected away from this extension.
Hence, the sequence Qn = QII;n chosen as (173) is expected to be an α′ -sequence for all α′ > α.
Naturally, with this sequence, the result is
lim hQII;n , aiH = QII;H′′ (a) = hQ2I aic .

(174)

n→∞

Note that the volume of the region is
|Dn,k,λ | =

Let us apply this on jI . Consider (45), and the fact that, thanks to (41), the two-point function
h(1 − Pτ )(1 − Pι )jI (x, t), jI (0, 0)iH is supported along a ballistic trajectory of velocity vIeff = 0,
as per (44). Thus, at large n, we have

This is valid for all α′ > α, and the tightest lower bound is obtained by taking α′ as near to

2
(180)
α≥ .

43

This shows that there is superdiffusion. Furthermore, the lower bound on α is indeed the
expected KPZ superdiffusive exponent. Clearly, if we further impose that the bounding argument
above, for |QII;H′′ (jI )|, gives a finite bound, proportional to the finite norm ||jI ||H(3−2α) , then we
must have α = (2 − α′ )/2; but as α ≥ 2/3, we must choose α′ = α and we obtain α = 2/3. The
consideration α′ = α is more subtle however; Point 3′′ must be modified to account for finite
corrections. These corrections can be argued to scale appropriately under integration, and the
bounding argument can be modified accordingly. A precise analysis may produce bounds on λ;
however this is beyond the scope of this paper.
