A BSTRACT
Data on nuclear level densities extracted from transmission data or gamma energy spectrum store
the basic statistical information about nuclei at various temperatures. Generally this extracted data
goes through model fitting using computer codes like CASCADE. However, recently established
semiclassical methods involving no adjustable parameters to determine the level density parameter
for magic and semi-magic nuclei give a good agreement with the experimental values. One of the
popular ways to paramaterize the level density parameter which includes the shell effects and its
damping was given by Ignatyuk. This damping factor is usually fitted from the experimental data
on nuclear level density and it comes around 0.05 M eV −1 . In this work we calculate the Ignatyuk
damping factor for various nuclei using semiclassical methods.

Introduction

Use of statistical ideas, for understanding nuclei comprising of closely spaced energy levels in their excited states, was
proposed by Bohr [1]. This is subsumed in the usage of level density for understanding the distribution of neutron
resonances, evaluating reaction cross sections and other experimental observables [2]. The study of level density has
been of interest even till the recent times [3]. Most of the computer codes which are utilized to evaluate the level
density of a nucleus are based on back-shifted Fermi gas (BSFG) formula [4] and constant temperature (CT) formula
[5]. The free parameters involved in these formulae can be experimentally obtained by fitting known energy levels
of complete level schemes at low excitation energies together with neutron resonances at the neutron binding energy
[6, 7, 8]. Gilbert and Cameron [9] proposed a formula for nuclear level density, composed of four parameters, which
combines the BSFG formula at high excitation energies with a CT formula for lower energies. By fitting the four
constants in both regions, experimental data may be well-reproduced [10].
However, all these models may not explain well the dependence of the level density on quantities of significant interest
like temperature, deformations [11] and angular momentum [12]. Phenomenological relations are used to describe
the thermal damping of the shell effects with increasing excitation energies [13, 14, 15] by exploiting microscopic
calculations for level density parameter to evaluate nuclear level density. One such widely used expression for fitting
the excitation energy (E ∗ ) dependent level density parameter, a(E ∗ ), by incorporating the role of shell effects was
given by Ignatyuk [13] as,


a(E ) = ã 1 + ∗ {1 − exp(−γE ∗ )}
E
∗


(1)

where ã = A/n M eV −1 is the asymptotic value of nuclear level density parameter. γ is called the damping coefficient
and δW denotes the shell correction energy which is given as the difference between the experimental binding energy
of a nucleus and the binding energy calculated from the liquid drop model [16]. The damping coefficient γ, has no
known exact expression and is often employed as a fitting parameter. It has the typical value between 0.04 to 0.07
MeV−1 (see for example, [17]).

A PREPRINT -

Semiclassical methods have been very useful in understanding complex systems like deformed nuclei [18, 19]. These
have been gainfully employed to obtain analytic expression for the ground states of deuteron [20] and triton [21], in
understanding shell effects in the light of chaos [22], nuclear dissipation [23, 24], nuclear cluster energies in astrophysical context [25] and even studying statistical properties of the nuclei [26]. Recent work [27] on the melting of
shell effects in magic and semi-magic nuclei with excitation energy, based on semiclassical trace formulae derived by
Brack and Jain [28], has resulted in level density parameter within 10%-15% of the experimental values and BSFG
model calculations with no adjustable parameters.
Here, we continue this line of work to evaluate the damping coefficient appearing in Ignatyuk prescription (1) which
is employed extensively to quantify the disappearance of shell effects at higher excitation energies. For N i-, Sn- and
P b- isotopes, we also study the energy average of the damping coefficient from 0 − 10 M eV of excitation energy and
its variation with the A/n model in a phenomenological way. In Table 1, for ã = A/8 M eV −1 , the calculated average
values of γ are given. The variation of damping coefficient with excitation energy E ∗ for different n is studied for
some P b- isotopes in Fig. 4. We further investigate the asymptotic behaviour of n in the regime where it is known that
the shell effects ‘melt’ due to high excitation energies. These studies may hint towards shape transitions and how the
nuclear potential changes.

Semiclassical Ignatyuk Formula

The expression (1) has variables of excitation energy E ∗ , excitation energy dependent level density parameter a(E ∗ ),
the parameter n used in the asymptotic model of ã = A/n M eV −1 , and the damping coefficient γ. E ∗ and a(E ∗ ),
can be determined semiclassically [27]. Then for a set value of n, we can evaluate damping coefficient γ.
The level density parameter a(T ) at finite temperature T is given as [29],

aT =

gT (µ)

(2)

where gT (µ) is the finite-temperature single-particle level density of the system at chemical potential µ. For realistic
nuclear level density parameter calculations, we exploit the single-particle level density for a spherically symmetric
harmonic oscillator potential with spin-orbit interactions at finite temperature [27] which may be split as,

gT (E) = g˜T (E) + δgT (E)

From equation (9), we can find the excitation energy as a function of temperature and consequently, we can have
excitation energy dependent level density parameter a(E ∗ ). These excitation energies E ∗ are used in (12) along with
corresponding level density parameters a(E ∗ ) to find γ at various excitation energies. The method of finding E ∗ and
a(E ∗ ) using the semiclassical trace formula [27] for magic and semi-magic nuclei having no adjustable parameters,
leading to temperature dependent level density parameter to be exact.

effects, or when shell effects have completely vanished. 48 N i also attains spherical symmetry (n = 10) when shell
effects are assumed to be completely washed off.
The excitation energy E ∗ as a function of temperature T is evaluated utilizing expression (9) after evaluation of
chemical potentials corresponding to neutrons and protons according to (7). Also, the level density parameter is
determined using (8) for N 6= Z.
In (12), the excitation energy, E ∗ , is a continuous variable and the only free parameter is in the asymptotic level density
parameter ã = A/n MeV−1 , which is usually taken between A/7 to A/10 MeV−1 . We calculate γ for ten nuclei
involving N i-, Sn- and P b- isotopes for various excitation energies between 0 − 10 MeV. The average of these values
for different n’s are plotted in Figs. 1, 2 and 3. The typical values of damping coefficient using n = 8 are given in
Table 1. These values have been studied experimentally for the P b- isotopes, and our evaluated values lie close to this
experimentally accepted range [17].

P b), and it tends to zero as n goes towards 10. Since n = 10 corresponds to harmonic oscillator potential, we can
say that as the system approaches a spherical symmetry, the shell contribution reduce for P b- isotopes.
A nuclear potential corresponding to an isotropic harmonic oscillator potential corresponds to ã = A/10, which has an
analogy to spherical nuclear shapes [33]. The semiclassical study in [27], for harmonic oscillator potential with spinorbit interactions also asserts this where the theoretically value of n comes out to be 10 for over 90 magic/semi-magic
nuclei.
In N i isotopes (Fig.1), we see a decreasing trend in γ as the n, changes. The damping parameter in 48 N i and 58 N i
approach to zero at around n = 8.4 and n = 9.5, respectively. This hints towards agreement with approaching the
spherical shape as the shell effects contribution decreases.
In Sn isotopes (Fig. 2), the δW values of 112,114,116 Sn are closer to zero as compared to other nuclei. This clearly
shows the contribution of the δW values in the dependence of γ with n. There is a steeper change of γ with n for
these Sn− isotopes.

Figure 4: Variation of γ with excitation energy for isotopes of P b for different values of n = A/ã. It can be seen that
as excitation energy increases, the γ values decrease, indicating the decrease of shell contributions. The shell contributions are lesser for higher n values, suggesting that as a spherical symmetry is achieved, the damping approaches to
zero.
In the case of P b- isotopes (Fig. 3), there is a decrease of γ with the increase of n values. These values come close to
the predicted value of γ ≈ 0.05 [17] for between n = 6 to n = 7 for 204−210 P b, and these values approach zero as n
approaches 10. For 182 P b, these values tend to zero much faster due to the δW value being closer to zero.
Fig. 4 shows the variation of γ with excitation energy E ∗ for various values of n for P b isotopes. Here it is visible
that the least damping, and hence closer is the value of the level density parameter to its asymptotic value, is observed
for n = 10. These low values of γ are achieved at n = 9 for 204 P b. This damping also decreases with the increase in
excitation energy, hinting the melting of shell effects with the increase in E ∗ .

with 58 N i and 182 P b, lie on n = 8.
Next, we fix the excitation energy E ∗ = 2 M eV and then find the best value of n for which a specific nucleus has γ
in the region of experimentally extracted values. These best values for excitation energy 2 M eV are plotted in Fig.
6. As per our calculations, best n differs from 10 for N i-, Sn- and P b- isotopes, which implies the role of pairing
correlations and deformation must be included in the potential as well to have better agreement with the experimental
values.

Asymptotic behaviour of n

The asymptotic value of the level density parameter, ã is given by ã = A/n. At high excitation energies, since the
shell effects melt away, the contribution of the γ-term becomes zero. The semiclassical formalism gives us excitation
energy dependence of the level density and this level density parameter at high energies (E ∗ > 10 M eV ) correspond
to the melted shell regime where the level density parameter approaches ã. For higher energy dependence of n, we
use the relation of ã, and find the dependence of n with excitation energy. Such systematics give hints of the form of
the nuclear potential corresponding to harmonic oscillator (n = 10) or of Woods-Saxon type (n = 8). In deformed
nuclei, such studies have been useful to understand shape transitions of nuclei with excitation energy [34].
From Figures 7 ,8 and 9, we see that the asymptotic values of level densities generally approach a constant value with
increase in excitation energy, hinting a similar nuclear potential guiding them throughout the excitation energy. They
remain between 9 and 10 for 48,58 N i, 112,114,116 Sn and 182−210 P b.
A calculation on the same lines for a known deformed nucleus, like 56 N i, which is known to exhibit shape coexistence
[35], shows asymptotic level density follows n = 12 trend. This may hint towards the contribution of pairing and
deformation in the nuclear potential.

Conclusions

We have calculated the damping coefficient, γ appearing in the Ignatyuk fitting prescription for ten nuclei involving
N i-, Sn- and P b- isotopes. These values of the damping parameter are found in agreement with values used by
experimentalists while analyzing the nuclear data in case of P b- isotopes. Further, the excitation energy dependence
of γ has been studied. As the excitation energy increases, the shell effects start to vanish, which means that the
level density parameter should approach the value of ã. This means that as excitation energy increases, γ should
decrease and tend to zero. This is demonstrated for many nuclei, an important illustrative instance is shown for the
P b- isotopes. As the value of n approaches n = 10, it is seen that the γ values attains the minimum values, suggesting
that the nucleus retains its spherical symmetry. We have further studied the asymptotic behaviour of n, which shows
