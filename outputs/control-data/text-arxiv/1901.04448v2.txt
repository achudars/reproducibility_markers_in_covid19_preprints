Abstract.
Systematic classification of Z2 × Z2 orbifold compactifications of the heterotic–string was
pursued by using its free fermion formulation. The method entails random generation of string
vacua and analysis of their entire spectra, and led to discovery of spinor-vector duality and
three generation exophobic string vacua. The classification was performed for string vacua
with unbroken SO(10) GUT symmetry, and progressively extended to models in which the
SO(10) symmetry is broken to the SO(6) × SO(4), SU (5) × U (1), SU (3) × SU (2) × U (1)2 and
SU (3) × U (1) × SU (2)2 subgroups. Obtaining sizeable numbers of phenomenologically viable
vacua in the last two cases requires identification of fertility conditions. Adaptation of machine
learning tools to identify the fertility conditions will be useful when the frequency of viable
models becomes exceedingly small in the total space of vacua.

1. Introduction
String theory provides a viable framework to explore the synthesis of quantum mechanics with
gravity. It gives rise to a multitude of phenomenological models that reproduce the main features
of the Standard Model (SM), such as the presence of three generations with the correct gauge
charges. A realistic string vacuum should reproduce the detailed structure of the Standard
Model spectrum, including the masses of elementary particles and flavour mixing. A desirable
property of phenomenological string vacua is the SO(10) embedding of the SM states, which
is motivated by the observed gauge charges and couplings. Existence of fundamental scalar
doublets to facilitate electroweak symmetry breaking is indicated by the observation at the
LHC of a scalar resonance compatible with the SM Higgs particle. The observed mechanism
is compatible with a perturbative elementary coupling. Supersymmetrising the SM spectrum
maintains the perturbative coupling up to the heterotic–string unification scale, thus enabling
consistent perturbative unification of the Standard Model with gravity.
The caveat to the successful unified framework provided by string theory is the enormous
number of potentially realistic string vacua. In the absence of clear indications from experiment
for supersymmetry, or for any other extension of the SM that augments the electroweak
symmetry breaking sector, the only method to constrain possible extensions of the SM is
by fusing it with gravity. Otherwise, the SM may be augmented with an infinite number of
continuous parameters. Synthesising the Standard Model with gravity therefore provides the
only meaningful contemporary route to gain further insight into the basic properties of the

fundamental matter and interactions. On the other hand, it should be also acknowledged that
our current understanding of string theory is rudimentary and progress may take longer than
that available for winning contemporary accolades. At present there is no concrete criteria that
singles out a specific string vacuum, or particular class of string models, as phenomenologically
preferable. Contemporary research in string phenomenology aims to explore large classes of
string compactifications and their properties.
2. Realistic string models in the free fermionic formulation
Among the most realistic string models constructed to date are the heterotic–string models in the
free fermionic formulation [1]. These models correspond to toroidal Z2 ×Z2 orbifolds with discrete
Wilson lines [2]. They produce an abundance of three generation models with various unbroken
SO(10) subgroups, including SU (5) × U (1) [3, 4]; SO(6) × SO(4) [5, 6]; SU (3) × SU (2) × U (1)2
[7, 8]; SU (3) × U (1) × SU (2)2 [9, 10], whereas the subgroup SU (4) × SU (2) × U (1) does
not produce viable models [11]. The free fermionic models produced the first known Minimal
Standard Heterotic String Models (MSHSM) [7, 8] that give rise solely to the spectrum of the
Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) in the observable charged sector, and have
been used to study many of the issues pertaining to the phenomenology of the Standard Model
and unification [14]. Other classes of string compactifications are investigated [15].
In the free fermionic construction of the heterotic string in four dimensions all
the extra degrees of freedom needed to cancel the conformal anomaly are represented
as free fermions propagating on the two dimensional string worldsheet [1].
In the
conventional notation the 64 lightcone gauge worldsheet fermions are denoted by:

where the six compactified coordinates of the internal manifold correspond to {y, ω|ȳ, ω̄}1,··· ,6
and the different symmetry groups generated by sixteen complexified right–moving fermions
are indicated. String vacua in the free fermionic formulation are defined in terms of boundary
condition basis vectors that denote the transformation properties of the fermions around the
noncontractible loops of the worldsheet torus, and the Generalised GSO (GGSO) projection
coefficients of the one loop partition function [1]. The free fermion models correspond to Z2 × Z2
orbifolds with discrete Wilson lines [2].
3. Realistic free fermionic models – old school
Three generation free fermionic models were constructed since the late eighties [3, 7, 5, 9]. The
early models were built by following a trial and error method, using a common structure that
underlined all the models, which consisted of a common set of five basis vectors known as the
NAHE–set [13], denoted as {1, S, b1 , b2 , b3 }. The gauge symmetry at the level of the NAHE–
set is SO(10) × SO(6)3 × E8 , with forty–eight multiplets in the spinorial 16 representation of
SO(10), arising from the three twisted sectors of the Z2 × Z2 orbifold b1 , b2 and b3 . The basis
vector S produces N = 4 spacetime supersymmetry, which is broken to N = 2 by the inclusion
of b1 and to N = 1 by the inclusion of both b1 and b2 . The action of b3 either preserves or
removes the remaining supersymmetry.

The second stage in the old school free fermionic model building consisted of augmenting the
NAHE–set with three or four additional basis vectors. The basis vectors beyond the NAHE–set
break the SO(10) gauge group to one of its subgroups and simultaneously reduce the number of
generations to three. In the standard–like models of [7] the additional basis vectors are denoted
as {α, β, γ}. They reduce the SO(10) gauge symmetry to SU (3) × SU (2) × U (1)B−L × U (1)R .
and the weak hypercharge is given by the combination
1
U (1)Y = (B − L) + T3R ∈ SO(10)!
2
Each of the sectors b1 , b2 and b3 gives rise to one generation which form complete 16
representations of SO(10). The models contain the required scalar states to break the gauge
symmetry further and to produce a quasi–realistic fermion mass spectrum [14].
4. Classification of fermionic Z2 × Z2 orbifolds – modern school
Since 2003 systematic classification of Z2 × Z2 orbifolds has been pursued by employing the
free fermionic model building tools to derive and analyse the spectrum and leading coupling of
these heterotic–string vacua. The initial classification method was developed in [16] for type II
superstring. It was extended in [12] to string vacua with unbroken SO(10) gauge group; and to
vacua with: SO(6)×SO(4) subgroup in [6]; SU (5)×U (1) subgroup in [4]; SU (3)×SU (2)×U (1)2
subgroup in [8]; SU (3) × U (1) × SU (2)2 subgroup in [10]. In the free fermionic classification
method the string vacua are generated by a fixed set of basis vectors, consisting of between
twelve to fourteen basis vectors, B = {v1 , v2 , . . . , v14 }. The models with unbroken SO(10) gauge
group are generated with a basis of twelve basis vectors

This vector combination plays an important role in the free fermionic systematic classification
method as it induces a map between sectors that produce SO(10) spinorial and vectorial
representations. The breaking of the SO(10) symmetry to the SO(6) × SO(4) subgroup is
obtained by including in the basis the vector [6]
v13 = α = {ψ̄ 4,5 , φ̄1,2 },

whereas the breaking to the SU (5) × U (1) subgroup is obtained with the vector [4]

and the breaking to the SU (3) × SU (2) × U (1)2 is obtained by including both vectors in (3)
and (4) as two separate vectors, v13 and v14 in the basis [8]. The breaking of the SO(10) gauge
symmetry to the SU (3) × U (1) × SU (2)2 subgroup is achieved with the inclusion of the basis

where the diagonal terms and below are fixed by modular invariance constraints. The remaining
fixed phases are determined by imposing N = 1 spacetime supersymmetry and the overall
chirality of the chiral and supersymmetry generators. Varying the 66 phases randomly scans a
space of 266 (approximately 1019.9 ) Z2 × Z2 heterotic–string orbifold models. A particular choice
of the 66, ±1 phases corresponds to a distinct string vacuum with massless and massive physical
spectrum. The analysis proceeds by developing systematic tools to analyse the entire massless
spectrum, as well as the leading top quark Yukawa coupling [18].
The power of the classification method is rooted in the structure of the set of basis vectors
in eq. (1). The Z2 × Z2 orbifold has sixteen fixed points per twisted plane. Each of these
fixed points can give rise to massless states in different representations of the unbroken four
dimensional gauge group. The basis vectors in eq. (1) enables the analysis of the GGSO
projection of each of these states individually. For example, states that arise in the 16 spinorial
(1,2,3)
representation of SO(10) are obtained from the Bpqrs sectors given by
1
Bpqrs
= S + b1 + pe3 + qe4 + re5 + se6

where p, q, r, s = 0, 1, whereas states that arise in the 10 vectorial representations of SO(10)
(1,2,3)
are obtained from the sectors Bpqrs + x, with the x–vector given in eq. (2). Thus, the initial
classification was developed in [12] for sectors producing spinorial 16 and 16 representations
and progressively extended to cover the entire Fock space. From the form of eq. (6) it is noted
that whenever the overlap of periodic fermions in a sector ξ and the vector vj is empty, the
operator on the left side of the equation is positive. Hence, depending on the choice of the
GGSO phase on the right side of eq. (6), the given state is either in or out of the spectrum.

code determines which p, q, r, s combinations survive the projectors and produce physical states.
Similar expressions are obtained for the the entire massless states producing sectors. In a
similar manner to the projectors the chirality of the surviving states is obtained. Thus, the
entire physical spectrum is determined, for a given randomly generated GGSO configuration.
Models that satisfy specific phenomenological requirements are fished out and their charges and
couplings can be analysed in greater detail. Using this free fermionic classification methodology
several seminal results were obtained. The first, illustrated in figure 1, is the discovery of a duality
under the exchange of the total number of (16+16) spinorial and 10 vectorial representations of
SO(10), and hence dubbed as spinor–vector duality [17]. This duality, akin to mirror symmetry,
results from the breaking of the right–moving N = 2 worldsheet supersymmetry and is a general
property of heterotic string vacua in which the right–moving N = 2 worldsheet supersymmetry is
broken. In the heterotic–string models with (2, 2) worldsheet supersymmetry the SO(10) gauge
symmetry is enhanced to E6 , and these vacua are self–dual under spinor–vector duality. This
enhancement resembles the same phenomenon under T –duality in which an enhanced symmetry
is generated at the self–dual point. The two cases, however, operate with respect to different
sets of moduli. Whereas T –duality acts with respect to the internal compactified space moduli
fields, spinor–vector duality operates with respect to the Wilson line moduli fields [17].

exophobic string vacua [6]. Heterotic–string vacua in which the SO(10) symmetry is broken to
a subgroup, while maintaining the SO(10) embedding of the weak hypercharge, necessarily give
rise to states in the spectrum that do not satisfy the SO(10) charge quantisation conditions.
Some of these states may carry fractional electric charge, which is highly constrained by
experiments. However, the exotic states may be confined to the massive spectrum, and not
arise as massless states. Such vacua are dubbed as exophobic string vacua. As illustrated in
figures 2 and 3, three generation exophobic string vacua were found in the space of fermionic
Z2 × Z2 orbifolds with SO(6) × SO(4) gauge symmetry but not with SU (5) × U (1). The two
figures demonstrate again the utility of the free fermion classification method in extracting
definite properties of the entire space of scanned vacua. Additional results from the random
classification method include the derivation of a string derived extra Z ′ model [19], and string
derived SU (6) × SU (2) GUT model [20].
5. What do we need machine learning for?
As elaborated in section 4 the free fermionic classification method provides a powerful tool
to extract definite properties and results from the space of Z2 × Z2 heterotic–string orbifolds.
In this section we would like to illustrate how the random classification method reaches the
limit of its utility. It demonstrates the need for the application of novel computer methods
in the classification program. The limitation of the random search method is apparent when
considering the classification of the vacua with SU (3) × SU (2) × U (1)2 (Standard–like Models
(SLM)) [8] or SU (3) × U (1) × SU (2)2 (Left–Right Symmetric (LRS)) [10] SO(10) subgroups.
Unlike the SO(6) × SO(4) and SU (5) × U (1), both SLM and LRS cases contain two vectors
that break the SO(10) symmetry. In the case of SLM models the basis necessarily contains
both vectors v13 of eq. (3) and v14 of eq. (4). The number of independent GGSO phases hence
increases from 66 to 78, or 1019.8 compared to 1024.5 . In the case of the LRS models the single
basis vector v13 ≡ α in eq. (5) is sufficient to break the SO(10) symmetry to the LRS subgroup.
However, the vector 2α breaks the SO(10) symmetry as well. The consequence in both cases is
the proliferation of sectors that break the SO(10) symmetry and give rise to exotic states. Table
1 shows the results of a random scan in a space of 1011 SLM heterotic–string vacua, where heavy
Higgs states are those required to break the extra U (1) symmetry embedded in SO(10), to the
Standard Model weak hypercharge. Here we note a distinction with respect to the SLM models
using the “old school” method. To break the extra U (1) along supersymmetric flat directions at
high scale requires the existence in the spectrum of the string SLM the SM singlet state in the
16 representation of SO(10), and its complex conjugate. The “old school” SLM models do not
give rise to the complex conjugate state [7]. The “old school” SLMs give rise to exotic Standard

Model singlets with 1/2 U (1)Z ′ charge, which are used to break the U (1)Z ′ symmetry along flat

not obtained in the random search approach. Moreover, models with light Higgs are not found
either. The difficulty stems from the fact that the frequency of three generation models with
viable Higgs spectrum is highly diminished. In table 2 we display similar data in the case of LRS
models. The results again illustrate the relative scarcity of viable models in the total sample of
vacua. In the case of LRS models we find a three generation model with viable Higgs spectrum
at a frequency of 3/1010 . These results demonstrate the limitation of the random search method
for extracting phenomenologically viable models from the total space.

6. Towards machine learning
To remedy the situation a new strategy is required. One possible approach is the genetic
algorithm approach developed in [21]. However, while this approach is efficient in extracting
phenomenologically viable models, the insight into the structure underlying the larger space of
vacua is lost, as it does not provide a classification algorithm. Hence, global properties, like
the spinor–vector duality cannot be gleaned in this approach. Consequently a new strategy is
required. The basic principle of the new strategy is to reduce the total number of vacua in
the space which is being scanned by identifying some condition on the GGSO phases that are
amenable for extracting phenomenologically viable vacua.
In the case of the SLMs fertility conditions are identified at the SO(10) level, i.e. involving
phases in the 12×12 sub–matrix of the total 14×14 complete matrix of the Standard–like models
[7]. These fertility constraints reduce the total number of independent phases to 44. At the
SO(10) level we perform a random search. As each SO(10) breaking stage reduces the number
of generations by a factor of two, we require SO(10) models with at least twelve generations.
Each one of the extracted SO(10) models is now amenable to produce three generation SLMs.
We refer to these phase configurations as fertile cores. Around each of these fertile cores we now
perform a complete classification of the remaining GGSO phases involving the SO(10) breaking
vectors α and β. Using this methodology generates some 107 SLMs, including new Standard–like
Models with novel features that were not obtained in the “old school” trial and error method,
including models with additional vector–like Q and Q and N and N states. Adaptation of
similar fertility like conditions in the case of the LRS classification is currently underway [22].

7. Conclusions
The Z2 × Z2 orbifold provide a case study how string theory may relate to the Standard
Model particle data. Early constructions consisted of isolated examples of three generation
models, whereas the more modern random classification method yielded of the order of 107
viable three generation models with differing SO(10) subgroups. In addition to producing
viable three generation models for phenomenological investigations, the classification method
provided penetrating insight into the global properties of the space of (2, 0) heterotic–string
compactification, via e.g. the observation of spinor-vector duality. However, the random method
has reached the limit of its usefulness, as seen in the case of the SLMs and LRS models. The
case is therefore made for adopting novel computer methods, such as reinforced learning into the
classification program, with the basic question at hand whether a computer code can identify
the fertility conditions that are amenable for phenomenological considerations.
