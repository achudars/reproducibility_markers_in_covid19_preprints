Pion beta decay, π + → π 0 e+ ν(γ), provides a theoretically clean ±0.3% determination of the
CKM matrix element Vud . Although impressive, that result falls short of super-allowed nuclear
beta decays where an order of magnitude better precision already exists. Here, we advocate a
new strategy for utilizing pion beta decay, based
on its utility in determining Vus /Vud via the

K
π
ratio RV = Γ (K → πlν(γ)) /Γ π + → π 0 e+ ν(γ) which provides a measure of f+
(0)|Vus |/f+
(0)|Vud |
independent of the Fermi constant and short-distance radiative corrections. Its dependence on the
ratio of two hadronic vector current form factors provides an interesting computational goal for
K

lattice gauge theory studies. Employing a recent lattice based value f+
(0)/f+
(0) = 0.970(2), we
find Vus /Vud = 0.22910(91) compared to Vus /Vud = 0.23131(45) obtained from RA = Γ(K →
µν(γ))/Γ(π → µν(γ)). Those independent Vus /Vud determinations exhibit a 2.2σ discrepancy.

That tension suggests: a needed shift in the lattice f+

range 0.961(4), experimental/theory input changes or “new physics” effects. Other features and
implications of RV and RA are also discussed.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The Standard Model (SM) of elementary particle physics includes a three-generation Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa
(CKM) [1, 2] 3 × 3 quark mixing matrix, Vij , i = u, c, t, j = d, s, b, which satisfies unitarity, V † = V −1 . That condition
gives rise to orthonormal relationships among its rows and columns. Of special interest is the first row constraint
|Vud |2 + |Vus |2 + |Vub |2 = 1.

(1)

Neglecting the tiny |Vub |2 ≃ 2 × 10−5 contribution [3], it simplifies to approximately the original Cabibbo [1] twogeneration relationship
|Vud |2 + |Vus |2 = 1.

(2)

An unambiguous experimental deviation from eq. (2) would signal the presence of “new physics” beyond SM (BSM)
expectations. BSM examples include right-handed weak currents, charged Higgs scalars, leptoquarks, Z ′ box diagram
loop effects, exotic muon decay amplitudes that effectively modify the value of the Fermi constant etc. Such a discovery
would have major repercussions; but, first, its acceptance would require evidence of high significance (5 or more sigma
effects) as well as confirmation by other measurements.
Up until recently, eq. (2) appeared to be well satisfied [3, 4]. However, a novel dispersion relation (DR) approach
[5] to super-allowed nuclear beta decay loop effects found an increase in the electroweak radiative corrections that
reduced Vud from 0.97420(21) to
|Vud | = 0.97370(10)NP(10)RC

DR Result [5],

(3)

where NP (nuclear physics) and RC (radiative corrections) label the uncertainty sources. A subsequent calculation
[6] based on a somewhat different approach found
|Vud | = 0.97389(10)NP(14)RC

CMS [6].

(4)

When used with the Vus average [3] from Kl3 (K → πlν) and Kl2 (K ± → l± ν) decays
|Vus | = 0.2245(8) Error scale factor 2,

(5)

the two approaches lead to roughly 3 and 2 σ deviations from unitarity respectively. Those discrepancies could be
early hints of “new physics” starting to show up as an effective deviation from CKM unitarity. Alternatively, missing
nuclear physics effects and theoretical uncertainties might eventually resolve the problem [7] more conventionally.

2
The current Vus situation requires some explanation. Kl3 decays considered alone give a relatively small
|Vus | = 0.2234(8) Kl3 decays.

(6)

In contrast, the ratio [8]
RA =

Γ(K → µν(γ))
,
Γ(π → µν(γ))

(7)

is generally considered a more dependable constraint, since common uncertainties in kaon and pion decays tend to
cancel in the ratio. That is particularly important for lattice gauge theory input calculations of fK + /fπ+ . From the
experimental constraint RA = 1.3367(28), one finds
|Vus |fK +
= 0.2760(4).
|Vud |fπ+

(8)

fK +
= 1.1932(19),
fπ +

(9)

|Vus |
= 0.23131(45).
|Vud |

(10)

Then using the lattice value [9]

one obtains

Agreement with three-generation unitarity requires
|Vud | = 0.97428(10) and |Vus | = 0.2253(4).

(11)

Those SM expectations are 2 or more σ different from some of the current |Vud | and |Vus | values shown above. RA ,
being rather free of theoretical and experimental uncertainties, currently represents our best first row CKM constraint
and should be taken seriously.
Having set the stage for CKM inconsistencies we now introduce and examine a weak vector current analog of
RA for which short-distance electroweak and some part of the QED radiative corrections as well as muon lifetime
normalization dependence via the Fermi constant cancel in the ratio. Our new vector current analog of RA may also
provide a useful target for testing lattice gauge theory calculations. The specific ratio we first consider is
RV =

Γ(KL → π ± e∓ ν(γ))
,
Γ(π + → π 0 e+ ν(γ))

(12)

which compares radiative inclusive Kl3 for the KL and πe3 decay rates. The KL is chosen because it is, currently,
the best measured. The denominator decay rate is generally viewed as a theoretically pristine method for measuring
Vud ; but, unfortunately, it is not quantitatively competitive with more precise determinations of that matrix element.
Nevertheless, we will show that RV is competitive as a normalization for Ke3 and its use for the determination of Vus
in much the same way but currently with about a factor of 2 less precision than RA . The two ratios are complementary
in that one tests the weak charged vector current while the other one probes the axial-vector analog.
II.

PION BETA DECAY

The branching ratio [10] for pion beta decay, π + → π 0 e+ ν(γ), is 1.038(6) × 10−8 where we have taken the liberty
to increase the published central value by +0.2%, in keeping with an updated [3] normalizing BR(π + → e+ ν(γ)) =
1.2325(23) × 10−4 . Used in conjunction with the pion lifetime 26.033(5) × 10−9 s, it implies the experimental decay
rate
Γ(π + → π 0 e+ ν(γ)) = 0.3988(23) s−1 ,

(13)

which can be compared with the rather precise SM theoretical prediction [11–14]

where the +0.0334(10) represents our estimate of the electroweak and quantum electrodynamics (QED) radiative
corrections and their uncertainty [13–17]. Its relatively small theoretical uncertainty is justified by the good agreement
between the current algebra [12, 14] and chiral perturbation theory [13] calculations of the radiative corrections.
Both include a universal short-distance 0.0234 electroweak correction combined with a 0.010(1) long-distance QED
contribution. Solving for Vud leads to
|Vud | = 0.9739(29).

(19)

That value is in good accord with expectations from CKM unitarity; but it is not competitive with super-allowed
nuclear beta decays which are more precise by better than an order of magnitude [4]. Even further improvement by
an additional factor of 2 or 3, which appears to be possible but challenging [15] would not make pion beta decay
directly competitive for determining Vud . However, we note that currently, the ±0.6% fractional uncertainty in the
pion beta decay rate (see eq. (13)) is similar to individual Kl3 rates used in the determinations of Vus . So, it can be
used to normalize Kl3 decay widths without a significant increase in the overall uncertainty and allows the potential
for further improvement. Those features provide the basis for our following discussion.
III.

THE RATIO RV

We begin by considering the KL (3e) partial decay width, traditionally normalized in terms of the muon lifetime
derived Fermi constant, Gµ . It has a form similar to eq. (14),

where Em = 0.26838 GeV is the maximum pion energy in the KL rest frame and λ+ = 0.0282(4) parametrizes the
K
average linear energy dependence (slope) of the form factor f+
[3]. Although we employ only the average λ+ term
in the form factor expansion for illustrative simplicity, the IK value found is very close, within (roughly) 1 σ, to
the result for IK obtained keeping higher order terms in the form factor expansion that is fit to the physical decay
spectrum. Alternatively, IK can be obtained using a dispersive approach. We actually employ the updated dispersive
value IK =0.15470(15) [19] in our following analysis. The radiative corrections (RCπ,K ) in eq. (14) and eq. (20) are
to a very good approximation equal in magnitude and cancel (up to the uncertainties) in the ratio, RV , defined in
eq. (12),

≃ 1 + RCK − RCπ = 1.000(2)K (1)π .

(23)

Cancellation includes common uncertainties in the short distance electroweak and QED radiative corrections. Shortdistance cancellation is expected; but the QED long-distance 0.010(2) cancellation with 0.010(1) appears to be
accidental. Long distance SM effects for other K decay modes will differ somewhat, numerically [18, 20] from
RCK = 0.0334(20) and do not fully cancel. Their remainders and correlated theory uncertainties are included as

4
part of the K contribution when we average over all Kl3 decay modes. The current underlying radiative correction
uncertainty is estimated to be about 0.2% at the decay rate level [20]. It represents a theoretical limitation for future
Kl3 extractions of Vus . We note, however, that further reduction in the radiative corrections uncertainty may be
possible using the current algebra formalism [12] for Kl3 decays as a check on chiral perturbation theory, an approach
recently advocated by Seng, Galviz and Meißner [21]. It could, in principle, allow one to refine the calculation of
RCπ − RCK and compare with the values we have taken from [12, 14, 18, 20]. Given the current excellent agreement
among the different Kl3 decay modes, we don’t expect major changes; but better precision along with a check of the
long distance QED corrections would be welcome. At present, experimental improvement in RV up to about a factor
of 3 can be envisioned before confronting theoretical uncertainty in the radiative corrections.
The usual method for extracting Vus is to compare the KL (3e) partial width theory with experiment to obtain the
K
constraint f+
(0)Vus = 0.2165(6). Employing a lattice gauge theory calculation for the form factor, is then used to
determine Vus at about the 0.3% level. Its value depends on the form factor as well as factorized electroweak short
and QED long-distance radiative corrections along with the Fermi constant, all of theoretical origin and assumed to
K
be consistent with the definitions of Vus and f+
(0) employed. Next, as an alternative, we normalize relative to pion
beta decay which provides a different perspective on testing CKM unitarity and a means to search for the presence
of “new physics”. Of course, a similar exercise can be carried out for any of the Kl3 neutral and charged kaon decay
modes. Then, the results (including correlated errors) can be averaged to somewhat reduce the uncertainties.
The ratio RV , defined in eq. (12), has the current experimental value
RVexp =

τπ × BR(KL → π ± e∓ ν(γ))
26.033(5) ns × 0.4056(9)
= 1.9884(115)(93) × 107 ,
=
τKL × BR(π + → π 0 e+ ν(γ))
51.16(21) ns × 1.038(6) × 10−8

(24)

where the first uncertainty stems from the pion partial width and the second from the KL lifetime and branching
ratio. The latter can be reduced by roughly a factor 2/3 by averaging over all Kl3 partial widths after accounting for
differences in phase space, QED corrections, particle masses, a second form factor for muon modes and in the case of
charged kaons strong isospin breaking [20, 22, 23].
The experimental value of eq. (24) should be compared with the SM prediction [18, 19, 22–25]

eq. (26) includes uncertainties from IK and RCK . Together they contribute about (22) to the (58). The radiative

breaking [26] for the neutral kaon. (The charged kaon form factor requires [27] about a 2.8(3)% increase to fully
account for its difference with the neutral kaon case. That shift is consistent with expectations due to strong isospin

breaking resulting from pion-etamixing.) The pion form factor, f+

and can be usually ignored. However, we retain the form factor ratio f+

such as finite size effects, to cancel.
Equating RV experiment and theory followed by weighted averaging over all Kl3 modes, allowing for correlated

where the central value has remained nearly unchanged; but, the kaon dependent uncertainty has been reduced by
about a factor of 2/3. We note that the χ2 /degree of freedom for the five Kl3 modes was found [19, 25] to be an
acceptable 0.98/4; so, it is not necessary to scale up the error. The goodness of the fit also helps validate the relative

for 2+1+1 quark flavors by about 2.2σ. That discrepancy can also be illustrated by inserting f+
(0)/f+
(0) = 0.970(2)
in eq. (27) which leads to Vus /Vud = 0.22910(91). It differs from eq. (10) by a related 2.2σ. If we only used KL (e3)
in our comparison, the 2.2σ difference would have been 2.0σ. Averaging over the five decay modes has not had a
dramatic effect. It does, however, demonstrate the consistency of our experimental and theoretical input.
The roughly 2σ discrepancy was already observed some time ago in global K decay fits [18]. Currently, averaging
over the five kaon beta decay modes indicates about a 2.6σ discrepancy with the unitarity based RA = 0.23131(45)
constraint for Vus . An alternative interpretation of the apparent lattice value discrepancy is the need for an additional
K
roughly −0.01 electromagnetic radiative correction relating electromagnetically free f+
(0) = 0.97 obtained from pure
lattice QCD with the form factor appropriate for the decay rate formula in eq. (20). Such an effect would increase the
central value of Vus to 0.2253, consistent with RA and CKM unitarity. If instead new physics is responsible for the
discrepancy, it is less likely due to short-distance electroweak radiative corrections, muon lifetime Gµ normalization
or some other effect common to numerator and denominator which cancels in the RV ratio. We note that a similar
K
discrepancy occurs in 2+1 flavor lattice gauge theories which predict f+
(0) = 0.968; supporting the interpretation
that a reduction in the lattice form factor by about −0.01 may be the most likely route to CKM unitarity. To resolve
this situation, additional lattice studies and scrutiny are needed.
K
We also note that employing Vus /Vud = 0.22910(102) suggested from RV , lattice f+
(0) = 0.970(2) plus threegeneration unitarity implies Vud = 0.97474(22) which exceeds eq. (11). That makes it more difficult to reconcile with
the current super-allowed nuclear beta decay discrepancy.
We averaged over all five Kl3 decay modes to reduce the second error in eq. (26) by roughly a factor of 2/3. Future
improvements in kaon measurements are expected [18, 23] to further reduce that part of the uncertainty by another 2/3,
leaving the partial width of pion beta decay as the dominant uncertainty in the error budget by about a factor of 2.5.
Improving the experimental pion partial beta decay width by a factor of 2 to 3 would bring the overall experimental
error budget for RV down by roughly a factor of 2. At that level, averaging over kaon modes becomes more important.
Such a reduction in the Vus /Vud uncertainty derived from RV along with a similar improvement in RA will together
strongly restrict or provide evidence for the existence of “new physics” at potentially high significance. The latter
scenario would be more likely if the Vud from super-allowed beta decays continues to show a deviation from CKM
unitarity. Neutron lifetime and decay asymmetry precision measurements should also help resolve the Vud problem
[6, 30]. Indeed, the larger radiative corrections found in [5, 6] combined with a unitarity favored 0.97428 for |Vud | and
1.2762 for gA predict a neutron lifetime of about 878 s with a small uncertainty.
More precise experimental measurements are clearly needed to reconcile CKM unitarity or unveil evidence for “new
physics.” Our study of pion beta decay and the utility of RV will hopefully reinvigorate interest in that experimental
effort. More specifically, on the basis of its complementary role, we advocate a new experiment on pion beta decay
designed to improve measurement of that rare branching ratio by an overall factor of 2 to 3 [10]. At that level,
combined with anticipated Kl3 improvements, it could provide the best determination of Vus or at least a consistency
check on lattice calculations. In addition, we encourage the lattice gauge theory community to examine the possibility
K
(0) and the form factor
of a reduced uncertainty to 0.001 and check for a difference in the definition of the lattice f+
as defined by RA
Note Added: After our paper was submitted for publication, a preprint by the PACS Collaboration appeared
K
[31]. It finds for a large lattice with 2+1 quark flavors, f+
(0) = 0.960(5). Also, a paper by X. Feng et al. [32] was
posted on the arXiv. It confirms our our calculation of the pion beta decay rate using a novel lattice approach and
reduces the theoretical uncertainty by a factor of 3, strengthening our result and its call for an improved experimental
measurement of that rare decay mode.
