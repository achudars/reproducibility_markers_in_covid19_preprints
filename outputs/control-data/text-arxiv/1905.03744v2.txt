ABSTRACT
We investigate individual distances and luminosities of a sample of 889 nearby candidate red supergiants
with reliable parallaxes (̟/σ̟ > 4 and RUWE < 2.7) from Gaia DR2. The sample was extracted from the
historical compilation of spectroscopically derived spectral types by Skiff (2014), and consists of K-M stars that
are listed with class I at least once. The sample includes well-known red supergiants from Humphreys (1978),
Elias et al. (1985), Jura & Kleinmann (1990), and Levesque et al. (2005). Infrared and optical measurements
from the 2MASS, CIO, MSX, WISE, MIPSGAL, GLIMPSE, and NOMAD catalogs allow us to estimate the
stellar bolometric magnitudes. We analyze the stars in the luminosity versus effective temperature plane and
confirm that 43 sources are highly-probably red supergiants with Mbol < −7.1 mag. 43% of the sample is made
of stars with masses > 7 M⊙ . Another ≈30% of the sample consists of giant stars.

1. INTRODUCTION

The Milky Way is the closest laboratory for resolved stellar populations and a prototype of spiral galaxies. Nonetheless our position within the disk and dust obscuration render
its study difficult. Red supergiants (RSGs) are the brightest
stars seen at infrared wavelengths, being young and cold objects with typical luminosity above 104 L⊙ . RSGs are tracers of stellar populations from 4 to 30 Myr, with masses from
about 9 to 40 M⊙ (e.g. Ekström et al. 2012; Chieffi & Limongi
2013); from their numbers and luminosities one can evaluate
Galactic star formation in this range of time. The distribution
of known spectral types of Galactic RSGs peaks at spectral
types M0–M2 (Elias et al. 1985; Davies et al. 2007).
Having said that, the current census of RSGs, including the
M-types is highly incomplete, with little being known about
their spatial distribution (see for example, Davies et al. 2009;
Messineo et al. 2016). At optical wavelengths, catalogs of
RSGs have been compiled by locating bright late-type stars
in directions of OB associations. Humphreys (1978) lists 92
RSGs, Elias et al. (1985) list 90 RSGs, Levesque et al. (2005)
analysed the spectra of 62 RSGs, Jura & Kleinmann (1990)
list ≈ 135 RSGs. Gehrz (1989) predicts at least 5000 RSGs.
Overall, less than a thousand Galactic late-type stars of class
I are known, with only about 400 RSGs. Their detection is
extremely difficult since their colors are similar to those of giant late-type stars and knowledge on their distances is poor,
and because their colours and magnitudes overlap with those
of the more numerous Asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars
(from low masses to Super-AGBs of 9-10 M⊙ ). Furthermore,
even though associations and clusters make it easier to detect
massive stars, it appears that only ≈ 2% of inner Galaxy supergiants are associated with stellar clusters (Messineo et al.
2017). Pulsation properties and chemical abundances are required for identifying the stage of evolution and the nuclear
burning that has occurred.
Gaia data allows us to classify individual stars by provid∗ THE

ing their distances. We prepared a catalog of bright late-type
stars reported at least once with class I, i.e., as stars of K- or
M-type and luminosity class I in the spectroscopic catalog of
Skiff (2014), and with data from Gaia DR2. Historical spectroscopic records provided spectral types that in combination
with Gaia parallaxes and photometric data enabled us to measure the stellar luminosities. With that in hand, we were able
to extract a catalog of genuine stars of luminosity class I and
to derive average magnitudes per spectral type. In Sect. 2, we
describe the sample, their parallaxes, and available infrared
measurements. In Sect. 3, we estimate the stellar luminosities
and provide average values per spectral type. In Sect. 4, we
summarize the results of our exercise.
2. OBSERVATIONAL DATA

2.1. The sample and available spectral types
We compiled a list of about 1400 K-M stars of class
I with latitudes |b| < 10◦ from the historical records of
stellar spectral types by Skiff (2014). All late-type stars
with at least one classification as luminosity class I were
retained. In addition, we cross-matched Skiff’s list with
existing Galactic compilations of RSGs, for example by
Humphreys (1978), Elias et al. (1985), Kleinmann & Hall
(1986), Jura & Kleinmann (1990), Caron et al. (2003),
Levesque et al. (2005), Figer et al. (2006), Davies et al.
(2008), and Verhoelst et al. (2009). We also made use
of the recent Galactic spectroscopic catalogues of bright
late-type stars by Blum et al. (2003), Comerón et al. (2004),
Clark et al. (2009), Liermann et al. (2009), Rayner et al.
(2009), Negueruela et al. (2010), Negueruela et al. (2011),
Verheyen et al. (2012), Dorda et al. (2016), Messineo et al.
(2017), and Dorda et al. (2018). Sources with available spectral types and good parallaxes (see Sect. 2.2) are listed in
Table 2. For sources listed in these recent catalogs, spectral classifications provided in the corresponding papers have
been retained (see footnotes to Table 2). The catalog by Skiff
(2014) collected spectroscopic classifications of Galactic stars
available from the literature, with some entries dating back to
1930–1950. For each star from one to a dozen entries were
available. For stars for which only one reference is given (that
to Skiff’s database) we listed a spectral type range as well as
the adopted spectral type, which is the mean (or most recent)

2

of the measured spectral types.

2.2.1. Astrometric quality filtering and best sample
The goal of this work is to build a catalog of secure known
K-M stars of class I, candidate RSGs, in Gaia DR2, and therefore to derive their average absolute magnitude for each spectral type. This means that here we calculate the luminosity
of the candidate RSGs by direct integration of their stellar
energy distribution (SED), independently of colours or other
information that might be obtained from the spectral energy
distribution. Hence, we rely on the Gaia DR2 parallax only to
estimate the distances of the sources in our sample. In order to
make sure the corresponding luminosity estimates are robust
we will apply a rather conservative filtering on the quality of
the parallax data, as described in the following.
Throughout the text we indicate with σ̟ the external
error
of the parallax3, which is defined as σ̟ (ext) =
p
2
k × σ̟ (int)2 + σ2s , where σ̟ (int) is the internal error provided by DR2, and k = 1.08 and σ s = 0.021 mas for G < 13
mag (bright), and k = 1.08 and σ s = 0.043 mas for G & 13
(faint).
In order to select sources with good quality astrometry we
analysed the ̟/σ̟ ratio and the so-called renormalized unit
weight error (RUWE) which the Gaia team recommends to
use instead of the filtering on the unit weight error described
in appendix C of Lindegren et al. (2018). The RUWE can be
calculated using lookup tables available from the ESA Gaia
web pages4 and it is described in detail in a publicly available
technical note (Lindegren et al. 2018). In Fig. 1 we show the
RUWE as a function of G for all the sources in our sample.
Stars for which ̟/σ̟ > 4 are indicated separately as
well as stars for which no colour information is available (for
which the value of the RUWE is less certain, this concerns
52 out of the 1342 sources in the sample). From this figure it is clear that most sources for which ̟/σ̟ > 4 have a

2.2. Available parallaxes
Gaia data were taken from the recently released Gaia DR2
catalog (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018, 2016), which contains 1.7 billion sources. Typically, for parallaxes of stars
brighter than G = 14 mag, quoted uncertainties are about
0.04 mas, ≈ 0.1 mas for G = 17 mag and ≈ 0.7 mas for
G = 20 mag (see Luri et al. (2018)). Luminous late-type stars
are characterised by brightness fluctuations due to convective motions and pulsation. The photocenters do not correspond to the stellar barycenters, but fluctuate around it (e.g.,
Chiavassa et al. 2011; Pasquato et al. 2011). This motion in
general does not lead to systematic parallax errors, however,
it degrades the goodness of fit of the astrometric solution
(Chiavassa et al. 2011).
Initial celestial positions were taken from the catalog of
Skiff (2014) and SIMBAD (Cambrésy et al. 2011) and improved with the positions of available 2MASS matches. Gaia
matches were searched using a radius of 1.′′ 5. This resulted in
1342 Gaia sources, providing matches for 96% of the initial
sample of late-type stars.
For 7.5% of the sample parallaxes were available from both
the Gaia DR2 and Hipparcos catalogs (ESA 1997); the mean
difference of parallaxes is 0.08 mas, with a dispersion around
the mean of 1.21 mas for stars with Gaia parallaxes larger than
2 mas.

(in red) and RUWE = 2.7 (in gray). The large brown dots indicate stars for
which ̟/σ̟ (ext)> 4, while the dark-green crosses indicate stars for which
no colour information is available from Gaia DR2.

RUWE value below 1.4 (the threshold value recommended in
Lindegren et al. 2018). A few stars with high signal to noise
parallax values are located at 1.4 < RUWE < 2.7. This suggests that a more relaxed filtering at RUWE < 2.7 is adeguate
for RSGs, so as to retain the brightest stars for which the
RUWE values may be affected by photocenter motions.
We further restricted our sample to stars with ̟/σ̟ > 4
in order to ensure robust distance estimates. We motivate this
in the next section. In the end we thus retained 889 sources
with ̟/σ̟ > 4 and RUWE < 2.7. The parallax range of the
sources after filtering is 0.19 to 7.53 mas.
2.3. Distance estimates
The proper use of parallaxes in the distance estimation
problem has been extensively reviewed in the context of
Gaia DR2 by Luri et al. (2018). Their recommendation is
not to use the inverse of the parallax as a distance indicator but to combine the parallax with other information and
treat the estimation of distance as an inference problem. In
our case we wish to use only the parallax in order to establish the luminosity of our stars independent from other
information and in that case the Bayesian distance estimation method proposed by Bailer-Jones (2015), in particular
using the exponentially decreasing space density prior, is a
good choice (Luri et al. 2018). We will use the distances
estimated by Bailer-Jones et al. (2018) for our selection of
source with good quality and precise parallaxes, and motivate this as follows. For parallaxes with ̟/σ̟ (ext) > 4
the Bailer-Jones et al. (2018) distances by design give essentially the same result as the 1/̟ estimator, because for any
reasonable length scale, L, of the exponentially decreasing
space density prior the likelihood dominates the posterior on
the distances. At larger relative parallax error, the prior plays
a stronger role which would make our luminosity class estimates somewhat dependent on the Galactic model employed
as a prior by Bailer-Jones et al. (2018). We verified that for

our sources the relative differences between the 1/(̟ − ̟0 ) 5
and Bailer-Jones et al. (2018) distance estimates are less than
5 per cent (see Fig. 2), with no trends as a function of the
value of L. A summary of relative differences between the
1/(̟ − ̟0 ) and the Bailer’s distances (RBJ ) are provided in
Table 1.
Using the distance estimates from Bailer-Jones et al. (2018)
even for our sample with very precise parallaxes has the added
advantage that the uncertainties on the distance estimates (as
well as on the distance moduli used below) are well defined.
On the contrary, the 1/̟ distance estimator follows a probability distribution which cannot be normalised and thus has
no expectation value or variance. Parallax uncertainties propagated into distance uncertainties (σd ≈ σ̟ /̟2 ) are thus
formally meaningless for the 1/̟ distance estimator (see
Luri et al. 2018).
2.3.1. RSGs related to clusters and radio parallaxes
In this work, we treated the stars individually. However, in
Table 2 we have annotated possible associations with known
clusters, which is based on current literature. Only 13% of
the sample was found associated. Memberships are not the
focus of this work as they require an extensive and careful
revision of each open cluster. For example, with Gaia DR2
data doubt is cast even upon the association of η Car with the
young cluster Trumpler 16 (Davidson et al. 2018).
The 22 RSGs reported in Table 2 as associated to the Per
OB1 association yield an average ̟ + 0.029 = 0.51 mas
with a dispersion around the mean of 0.13 mas, or an average
̟ + 0.029 = 0.54 mas with a dispersion of 0.11 mas when
including only the best quality sources. The annual parallax
of maser spots measured toward S Persei is 0.413 ± 0.017 mas

(Asaki et al. 2010). Unfortunately, the Gaia parallax of S Persei (G=7.80 mag) has a large uncertainty, ̟ = 0.22 ± 0.13
mas, RUWE=1.27, ̟/σ̟ (ext)=1.67.
Zhang et al. (2012) and Choi et al. (2008) reported on astrometric observations of H2 O masers around the red supergiant
VY Canis Majoris (G = 7.17 mag). The trigonometric parallax is 0.88 ±0.08 mas, corresponding to a distance of 1.140.11
−0.09
kpc. Unfortunately, Gaia measurements are highly uncertain
(̟ = −5.92 ± 0.89 mas, RUWE=17.19).
The red hypergiant VX Sgr (G = 7.17 mag) has a
trigonometric parallax of 0.64 ± 0.04 mas, corresponding to
a distance of 1.56+0.11
−0.10 kpc (via water maser observations,
Xu et al. 2018). Chen et al. (2007) had estimated a distance
of 1.57 ± 0.27 kpc with SiO maser observations. Gaia parallax is ̟ = 0.79 ± 0.27 mas, 1.36+1.02
−0.41 kpc (RUWE=1.96,
̟/σ̟ (ext)=3.17). VX Sgr remains outside of our selected
889 stars because of its low ̟/σ̟ , however, the radio parallax and Gaia parallax agree within 23%.
The red supergiant PZ Cas (G = 6.64 mag) has an annual parallax of 0.356 ± 0.026 mas, corresponding to a
distance of 2.81+0.22
−0.19 kpc (from water maser observations,
Kusuno et al. 2013). Gaia measurements are consistent within
errors (̟ = 0.42 ± 0.09 mas, 2.22+0.53
−0.36 kpc, RUWE=1.06,
̟/σ̟ (ext)=4.67). PZ Cas is listed in Table 2. The radio and
Gaia parallaxes agree within 18%.
2.4. Photometric catalog
Photometric JHKs measurements from the Two Micron
All Sky Survey (2MASS) catalog (Skrutskie et al. 2006;
Cutri et al. 2003) were available for 97% of the sample in Table 2. Their Ks values range from −4 mag to about 12.5 mag.
Of the Ks magnitudes 43% are brighter than Ks = 4 mag, and
magnitudes are based on the fitting of the wing of the PSF on
the 51ms exposures (red flag Rk = 3, see Table 2). For 6.5%
of these stars, we were also able to retrieve J, H, and K measurements in the Catalog of Infrared Observations, CIO 5th
edition, by Gezari et al. (1996); the average difference at 2 µm
is 0.13 mag with σ = 0.14 mag. For the remaining 2.7% of
the sample with missing near-infrared measurements, we used
the photometry of Morel & Magnenat (1978), Liermann et al.
(2009), Messineo et al. (2010), and Stolte et al. (2015). For
the faintest star OGLE BW3 V 93508 (K = 13.9 mag) the
measurements are from Lucas et al. (2008).
For 78% of the stars mid-infrared measurements from
the Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX, Egan et al. 2003;
Price et al. 2001) were available. For 27% of the sample 24
µm measurements from MIPSGAL by Gutermuth & Heyer
(2015) were available. For 32% of the sample there
were GLIMPSE measurements (Churchwell et al. 2009;
Benjamin et al. 2005); for 96% mid-infrared measurements
from 3.6 µm to 22 µm were available from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) (Wright et al. 2010). We used
an initial search radius of 5′′ and selected the closest matches.
The MSX matches were at an average distance of 1.′′ 3 with
σ=0.′′ 9 from the 2MASS positions; the WISE matches at an
average distance of 0.′′ 4 (σ=0.′′ 4). The Gaia positions were
searched to within 1.′′ 5 of the 2MASS positions, and have an
average displacement of 0.′′ 17 and a σ=0.′′ 13 from the 2MASS
centroids; 2MASS stars are the closest matches to the Gaia
sources and also the brightest Ks sources. Matches were confirmed with a visual inspection of 2MASS and WISE images,
as well as of the stellar energy distribution (SED). Notes on
the matches are provided in Appendix A.

3. LUMINOSITIES

3.1. Bolometric magnitudes
We estimated the stellar luminosities using the photometric measurements, an extinction power law with an index of
1.9 (Messineo et al. 2005), and the distance moduli derived
from the Gaia parallaxes. For spectral types from K0 to M5,
intrinsic J−Ks and H−Ks colours were taken from Koornneef
(1983). For M6–M9 types intrinsic colours were derived from
the colours of giants (e.g. Koornneef 1983; Montegriffo et al.
1998; Cordier et al. 2007) and the average offset between the
colours of giants and supergiants of types M3–M5 were applied. Bolometric corrections to the absolute K-magnitudes
were provided by Levesque et al. (2005). In addition to
this calculation, we performed a direct flux integration using
the JHKs measurements, and the mid-infrared measurements
from MSX, WISE, GLIMPSE, and MIPSGAL. Measurements were dereddened with extinction ratios as described in
Messineo et al. (2005). The integral under the stellar energy
distribution (SED) was estimated with the trapezium method;
flux extrapolations at the red-extremes were performed with a
linear interpolation passing through the last reddest data-point
and going to zero flux at 500 µm, while at the blue-extreme
(bluer than J-band) we use a black body extrapolation (see
Messineo et al. 2017). Red extrapolation contains about 5‰
of the flux. The average difference between the Mbol calculated with the BCKS and those calculated by integrating under
the SED is 0.05 mag with a σ=0.18 mag. Inferred Mbol values
are listed in Table 6.
We estimated de-reddened BV photometry, Vo and Bo , by
using the estimated AKs and assuming R = 3.1 and the extinction ratios in Messineo et al. (2005).
3.2. Luminosity classes and nuclear burnings
The MK system was established in 1943 by Morgan and
Keenan, and it is an empirical system for the stellar spectral classification. It is based on a known atlas of standard
stars with spectral types and luminosity classes (Morgan et al.
1943). Stellar spectra are classified by direct comparison
with spectra of standard stars observed at the same resolution
and with the same instrument. Through quantitative spectral
analysis one can estimate gravity, g, or Teff , however, such
quantities are external to the definition of MK system itself.
While spectroscopic indicators of luminosity for dwarfs and
evolved late-type stars are at our disposal from atomic lines
and molecular bands, the separation of giants and supergiants
remains difficult. Furthermore, spectroscopic optical and infrared classifications may provide somewhat different results
(Gray & Corbally 2009); supplementary information on distances, luminosities, and chemical composition is necessary.
Higher extinction renders the MV versus Bo − Vo unsuitable
for studies of the inner Galaxy, and it is useful to translate the
optical quantities into infrared quantities and theoretical quantities. Furthermore, it is useful to look at these diagrams by
keeping in mind which types of nuclear burnings may occur.
AGBs and RSGs are cold objects with similar ranges of effective temperatures, therefore spectral types. They overlap in
luminosity. AGB stars can even be brighter than RSGs, and
it is not known apriori from the luminosity classes the type of
internal nuclear burnings and neither their distances.

5

AGB stars are stars of low or intermediate masses (. 9
Msun) burning helium and hydrogen in shells, with a degenerate core of CO. AGB stars from 6.5 to 9.5 M⊙ experience
off-center nuclear burnings and from 9 to 10 M⊙ can even
reach iron core state and evolve into neutron star.
As Iben (1974) writes, massive stars are stars which do not
develop a strongly electron-degenerate core until all exoergic reactions have run to completion at the center. RSGs are
massive stars from ≈ 9 to ≈ 40 M⊙ (Ekström et al. 2012).
Most of them are burning He when they reach the RSG phase.
For a RSG of 9 M⊙ models predict Mbol from −4.5 to −6.8
mag and spectral types from K0 to M4.5, while for a RSG of
25 M⊙ , Mbol ≈ −8.8 mag and spectral type K5 (see Table 4).
Observations closely follow the new evolutionary tracks by
Ekström et al. (2012). The Mbol values of the ≈ 90 Galactic
RSGs recently analysed by Levesque et al. (2005) range from
Mbol =−3.63 mag to Mbol = −10.36 mag.
A few observational luminosity benchmarks of late-type
stars of low and intermediate masses are here useful. The tip
of red giant branch stars in Galactic globular clusters occurs
at Mbol = −3.6 to −3.8 mag in metal-rich globular clusters,
such us 47 Tuc (e.g. Ferraro et al. 2000); members brighter
than that are thermally pulsing TP-AGBs. The maximum luminosity that more massive AGB stars can reach is about −7.1
mag (Vassiliadis & Wood 1993). Very massive AGB stars
may experience hot-bottom burning which further increases
their luminosity, but this phenomenon primarily affects metal
poor populations and is thus expected to only moderately affect the Milky Way disk population. The latest models of
Doherty et al. (2015) predict that a super-AGB of 9 M⊙ would
reach Mbol = −7.6 mag. Therefore, AGBs do have a large
overlap in luminosity with RSGs, and may enter the luminosity classes Ia, Ib, and Ib-II; for example, as pointed out by
the kind referee, α Her is an AGB of 2–3 M⊙ with class IbII (Moravveji et al. 2013), and NGC6067 hosts several AGBs
of 6 M⊙ with types K0-K4 and classes Iab-Ib, Iab-Ib and Ib
(Alonso-Santiago et al. 2017).
However, observationally, we can see that field AGB stars
in the Baade’s Windows with Mbol from ≈ −5.0 to −7.1 mag
are large amplitude pulsators (Miras) (e.g. Alard et al. 2001),
and generally have late-M spectral types, M4-M9 (i.e. Teff
cooler than 3500 K, Alard et al. 2001; Blanco et al. 1984);
similarly, the 4 Mira stars (V1-V4) at the tip of the red branch
of the globular cluster 47 Tuc have spectral types M4-M5
(Glass & Feast 1973; Skiff 2014). By contrast, semiregular
AGB pulsators are typically fainter than Mira AGBs: −2.5 &
Mbol & −5.0 mag, while Miras have −3.6 & Mbol & −7 mag
(e.g., Alard et al. 2001).
In conclusion, only stars brighter than Mbol ≈ −7.5 mag
(masses > 15 M⊙ ) are certain RSGs; late-type stars earlier
than M4 and with Mbol . −5.0 mag are expected to have
masses & 5 − 7 M⊙ . For field late-type stars fainter or redder than that, AGB stars are the dominant population when
Mbol < −3.6 mag (see Table 4).
3.2.1. Reference RSGs
We consider as reference RSGs those stars included in the
catalogs of Kleinmann & Hall (1986), Levesque et al. (2005),
Caron et al. (2003), Jura & Kleinmann (1990), Elias et al.
(1985), and Humphreys (1978). These sources are expected
to be RSGs, because they are located in the direction of OB
associations. In the upper-left panel of Fig. 3, we show
their luminosities, log(L/L⊙ ), versus Teff (theoretical plane);
in the lower panel, we show their absolute and dereddened

the catalogs of Caron et al. (2003, blue crosses), Kleinmann & Hall (1986, cyan asterisck), Levesque et al. (2005, red pluses), (Jura & Kleinmann 1990, magenta
diamonds), Elias et al. (1985, orange squares), and Humphreys (1978, green triangles). An average error bar is drawn on the right-upper corner. The two magenta
long-dashed horizontal lines marks Mbol =−3.6 mag (tip of the red giant branch), and −7.1 mag (AGB limit). The long-dashed cyan line marks the Eq. (1); RSGs
appear brighter and bluer than that locus (see text). Stellar tracks from models at solar metallicity and including rotation are from Ekström et al. (2012); from the
bottom to the top: the black dotted-dashed curve marks a stellar track of a 7 M⊙ star; the green long-dashed curve marks a 9 M⊙ track; the black dotted curve a
12 M⊙ track; the green dotted-dashed curve shows a 15 M⊙ track; the black long-dashed the track of a 20 M⊙ track, and the top green dotted line that of a 25 M⊙ .

Ks , Kso −DM versus Jo − Kso (observational plane); DM is the
distance moduli. By comparison with the stellar tracks, we estimated initial masses from about 7 to 25 M⊙ (Ekström et al.
2012). Among them, the brighest star appears to be SW
Cep with Mbol = −8.42 mag. MY-Cep is the only M7.5 I included in the sample. A few stars were discarded as reference RSGs, because they appeared too faint for luminosity
class I (Mbol > −3.6 mag, as shown in Fig. 3); those stars
are IRC+40105, 6 Aur, 1 Pup, sigOph, IRC +00328, 33 Sgr,
12 Peg, BD+47 3584, 56 Peg (Jura & Kleinmann 1990), CD57 3502 (Elias et al. 1985), CPD-59 4549, HD 142686, and
HD 150675 (Humphreys 1978).
3.2.2. Hertzsprung-Russell diagram
All reference RSGs, but MY Cep, appear located along the
ascending stellar tracks in Fig. 3. They are located to the
left of the following equation (which is roughly parallel to the
ascending parts of the tracks at the low Teff end):
log(L/L⊙ ) = 51.3 − 13.33 × log(Teff ) ,
(1)
where log(Teff ) ranges from 3.54 to 3.6 (i.e., from M4 to K1,
Levesque et al. 2005).
The temporal evolution of an AGB star is characterised by
large excursion in the Mbol versus Teff diagram. During the

thermal pulses the luminosity increases and Teff decreases.
For example, a star 3 M⊙ may reach Mbol =≈ −2 mag during the early-AGB phase and Mbol =≈ −5 mag during thermal
pulses (e.g., Vassiliadis & Wood (1993)).
In Fig. 4, we show the luminosities of stars in Table 6, and
we verify their positions on the Mbol versus Teff diagram by using the described observational benchmarks and the features
appearing in Fig. 3:
A Area A contains late-type stars with Mbol . −7.1 mag,
those are expected to be mostly RSGs.
B Area B contains stars with −5.0 >Mbol > −7.1 mag and
earlier than an M4. This area is rich in stars with masses
larger than 7 M⊙ .
C Area C contains late-type stars with −5.0 >Mbol > −7.1
mag and later than an M4. This area is expected to be
dominated by AGBs (4-9 M⊙ ).
D Area D contains late-type stars with −3.6 >Mbol > −5.0
mag and bluer than Eq. (1). This area contain AGBs of
intermediate masses and some faint K-type 9 M⊙ stars
at the onset of their cold phase (Mbol = −4.5 mag).

Mbol < −7.1 mag (Area=A). Orange asterisks mark sources with Mbol < −5.0 mag and types < M4 (Area=B). Cyan squares mark sources with −3.6 >Mbol > −5.0
mag and bluer that Eq. (1) (Area=D). Brown pluses (Mbol < −5.0 mag) and green pluses (−3.6 >Mbol > −5.0 mag) indicate the Areas C and E. Gray diamonds
indicate giants, i.e., stars fainter than Mbol ≈ −3.6 mag (tip of the red giant branch, Area=F). The two magenta long-dashed horizontal lines mark Mbol =−3.6
mag (tip), mag, and Mbol =−7.1 mag (AGB limit). For comparison, we add some rotating stellar tracks with solar metallicity by Ekström et al. (2012). From the
bottom to the top: the black dotted-dashed curve marks a stellar track of a 7 M⊙ star; the green long-dashed curve marks a 9 M⊙ track; the black dotted curve a
12 M⊙ track; the green dotted-dashed curve shows a 15 M⊙ track; the black long-dashed the track of a 20 M⊙ track, and the top green dotted line that of a 25 M⊙ .
Right Panel: Absolute and dereddened Ks magnitudes versus de-reddened J−Ks colors. Data points are as described in the left panel.

E Area E contains late-type stars with −3.6 >Mbol > −5.0
mag and redder than Eq. (1). This area is expected to be
dominated by old and more abundant AGBs (2-3 M⊙ ).
F Area F contains late-type stars with Mbol > −3.6 mag.
Those stars are fainter than the tip of the red giant
branch.
In Fig. 4, in the theoretical Mbol versus Teff diagram as well
as in the observational Kso −DM versus Jo − K so diagram, we
mark the areas defined above with different colors. These luminosity areas are also added in Table 6. In Fig. 5, we show
an histogram of the spectral types of the 889 sources with
̟/σ̟ > 4 and RUWE < 2.7.
Reference RSGs appear to be made by stars with class Ia
and Iab (35%), as well as of stars with class Ib (33%). In Figs.
3 and 5, the distribution of reference RSGs appears similar to
that of stars Ia and Iab, with stars falling mostly in the Area A
and B; but it’s different than that of class Ib stars, which are
sparsely distributed over the Area A,B,C,E, and F.
From Table 2, about 43 sources (5%) are found to be located
in the Area A (Mbol . −7.1 mag). Among them there are two
stars, HD 99619 and HD 105563 A, with previous uncertain
class. 312 sources (35%) are located in Area B and are likely
more massive than 7 M⊙ . About 30% of the sample is made
of stars fainter than the tip of the red giant branch (Area F).
A large number of RSGs detected at infrared wavelength
(about 300) was included in the presented compilation; however for most of those stars parallaxes are not available
in DR2 (Table 5 shows only 16 stars from infrared catalogs), (for example, Davies et al. 2008, 2007; Liermann et al.
2009; Clark et al. 2009; Negueruela et al. 2010, 2011, 2012;
Messineo et al. 2017).
3.3. Gaia variables
We searched our sample for the presence of Gaia variables
and found that only 137 stars of the initial 1342 source with
Gaia data were flagged as variables (Holl et al. 2018), and 90
out of the 889 with good parallaxes (about 10%). The spectral
types of all 90 but one variables range from K5 to M7, and 83
of them are automatically classified by the Gaia pipeline as

long period variables, LPVs, including Mira and semiregular (SR) stars. Their average variation in G-band is 0.51 mag
with a dispersion around the mean of 0.38 mag, including two
stars with variations above 2.5 mag (0.1%), which are in Area
C and E. There are 65 (out of 90) variables in Area A and
B; their variations in G-band range from 0.2 mag to 0.8 mag,
with a mean variation of 0.41 mag and dispersion around the
mean of 0.14 mag. Similar values are found with the 9 variables of class Ib (a mean of 0.46 mag and a σ = 0.33 mag).
There are 9 variables fainter than Mbol > −3.6 mag (Area F),
with 7 of them later than M5. Their mean variation is 0.63
mag and σ = 0.45 mag.
An analysis of the G-band light curves will be presented
elsewhere.
3.4. Average magnitudes per spectral type.
In Table 7 we present average magnitudes per spectral type
of stars of class I and with Mbol < −5.0 mag, and of stars with
−3.6 <Mbol < −5.0 mag. This table is useful for Galactic star
counts (e.g. Wainscoat et al. 1992). In Table 2 of Just et al.
(2015) infrared luminosities of Hipparcos stars per classes are
also provided; for example, their K-M2 I-II stars have MK =
−9 mag. For stars with spectral types K-M2 I and Mbol < −5.0
mag, our Table 7 provides an average MK = −8.40 mag with
σ=0.39 mag.
Additionally, in Tables 8 and 9 we present average magnitudes per spectral type of stars of classes Ia and Iab and of
stars in the reference RSG sample.
In Fig. 7, we plot the calculated average magnitudes per
spectral types of stars with classes Ia and Iab, as well as of
stars in the reference RSG sample, versus the Teff values. Teff
were estimated from the spectral types with the temperature
scale given by Levesque et al. (2005). For stars with Teff from
3650 k to 3950 k, Mbol values seem to decrease with decreasing Teff values.
3.5. Spatial distribution
The bright cool stars here analyzed span 360◦ of longitude
(Fig. 6). By using the estimates of distances in Table 2, we
obtained the distribution on the Galactic plane shown in Fig.

6. Late-type stars brighter than Mbol =−5.0 mag (0.8 × 104
L⊙ ) appear radially more distant from the Sun than the whole
sample, with heliocentric distances ranging from ≈ 200 to
≈ 4600 pc. Star eta Per (K3 Ib-II) is 239 pc away from us
(̟ = 4.21 ± 0.37 mas), and HD 200905 (K4.5 I) is 283 pc
away (̟ = 3.59 ± 0.42 mas). Antares (alpha Sco, M1.5 Iab)
with an estimated distance of ≈ 170 pc does not have Gaia
parallax measurement yet. PER286 (M2.0 Ib) has an estimated distance of 4.2 kpc (̟ = 0.20 ± 0.04 mas).
4. SUMMARY
In order to create a catalog of stars with luminosity class
I, candidate RSGs, from Gaia DR2, we collected 1406 bright
late-type stars with at least one spectroscopic record as class I.
Spectral types were taken from the collection by Skiff (2014),
and in the majority of cases appeared within the uncertainty
of 2 subclasses (i.e., the range of types reported for a single entry). For well known sources, such as those analyzed
by Dorda et al. (2018), Dorda et al. (2016), Levesque et al.
(2005), Jura & Kleinmann (1990), Elias et al. (1985), and
Humphreys (1978), spectral types and luminosity classes
were taken from these works. At the present time, only a fraction equal to 13% of this sample is known to be associated
with open clusters. For each source, we collected available
photometric measurements from 2MASS, CIO, MSX, WISE,
MIPSGAL, GLIMPSE, and NOMAD catalogs and estimated
their apparent bolometric magnitudes.
We retrieved parallaxes for 1342 sources from Gaia DR2, of
which 1290 have a (GBP − GRP ) colour. After a data filtering
based on signal to noise and astrometric quality (̟/σ̟ > 4
and RUWE < 2.7), we were left with a best-quality sample of
889 sources.
With the parallactic distances, we were able to estimate the
stellar luminosities, and to build Mbol versus Teff diagrams of

stars with different classes.
The Galactic catalog of RSGs, i.e., of very likely massive
stars because of luminosity and associations with OB stars,
by Humphreys (1978), Elias et al. (1985), Jura & Kleinmann
(1990), Levesque et al. (2005), Caron et al. (2003) contains
170 stars. 118 of these reference RSGs had good parallaxes
in DR2 and Mbol < −3.6 mag. While these reference RSGs
appear to contain stars of class Ia, Iab (40%) as well as class
Ib (31%), their distribution on the Mbol versus Teff diagrams
resembles that of class Ia, Iab, with 81% of them located in
Area A and B. Only 44% of class Ib stars with Mbol < −3.6
mag fall in Area A and B.
For 609 stars (68% of 889 analysed stars), Mbol values were
found smaller (brighter) than −3.6 mag, with 536 of them already reported in previous literature exclusively as of classes
I or II. 5% of the them appear highly-probable massive stars
(stars in Area A), while 41 % of them are stars in Area A and
B, likely more massive than 7M⊙ .
A fraction equal to ≈ 30% of the sample appears to be made
of stars fainter than the tip of the giant branch (Area F).
A natural output of this luminosity exercise is a tabulated
average of absolute magnitudes of luminous late-type stars
and RSGs per spectral type. This finer grid of magnitudes
will help to predict distances of extragalactic luminous latetype stars.
This catalog is a little exercise on the use of accumulate
spectroscopic knowledge in support of the Gaia mission. The
catalog serve for high-resolution follow-up spectroscopy, for
example, with ongoing large spectroscopic surveys such as
LAMOST and GALAH. This is important to understand the
evolution and nucleosynthesis occurring in RSGs and massive
AGBs (and super-AGB stars). Luminosities, spectral types,
and chemistry are key ingredients for an improved study of
the Galactic structure and its recent history.

APPENDIX
A. NOTES ON PHOTOMETRIC DATA
Typically, initial coordinates by Skiff (2014) are good to within a few arcseconds. A few coordinates were corrected with
SIMBAD. An iterative process was needed to make sure to properly identify the counterparts at different wavelengths. The
Galactic plane is crowded with sources.
For stars at longitude |l| > 1◦ and latitude |l| > 0.5◦ , measurements were associated automatically with a selection of good
flags to ensure quality. MSX upper limits measurements were discarded, and WISE sources were chosen with a minimum

signal-to-noise larger than 2. GLIMPSE matches were associated with a magnitude cut at 10 mag, and when a WISE source
was existing positional coincidence was inspected. The searched stars were usually the brightest at near- and mid-infrared
wavelengths, and chart identification was easy. 2MASS matches are as in the WISE and GLIMPSE catalogs. Due to saturation
and centroid problems, a few 2MASS identifications had to be fixed (e.g. BD+54 315, VY CMa, Cl* Westerlund 1 26, MZM29,
MZM33, RSGC1-F08, IRAS 17433−1750). For stars HD 126152, HD 149812, HD 227793, BD +36 4025, which have good
quality parallaxes but no 2MASS errors, we assumed an error in Ks =0.8 mag (see the quality flag provided in Table 6). For
omi02 Cyg, JK photometry was taken from Morel & Magnenat (1978). For stars [MMF2014] 78, [MFD2010] 5, [GLIMPSE9]-

Notes: The identification number (Id) is followed by the 2MASS JHK measurements with corresponding red flags (Rj,Rh,Rk) and quality flags
(Qj,Qh,Qk), CIO JHK magnitudes, MSX A, C, D, E magnitudes, WISE W1, W2, W3, W4 magnitudes, MIPS 24 µm magnitude, the NOMAD BVR
magnitudes, and the Nstar value.
(+ ) Nstar=XYZ, where X=number of MSX detected within the search radius; Y= number of WISE stars within the search radius; Z= number of
GLIMPSE stars with 8 µm magnitudes < 10 within the search radius. A value equals to 9 indicates that the counter is not available.
(∗ )If the 2MASS quality flags are equal to ’M’ the measurements have other origins as specified in Appendix A.
A few WISE and MSX measurements were discarded (Appendix A).

6, and [MMF2014] 46/[MFD2010] 8, HST HK data were available (Messineo et al. 2010); for the faint OGLE BW3 V 93508,
near-infrared magnitudes are from Lucas et al. (2008). For the highly-crowded central region (|l| < 1.0◦ and |b| < 0.5◦ ), only the
K-band photometry of Liermann et al. (2009) is provided, and for stars IRC−30320 , IRC−30322, [RHI84] 10−565, MZM115

Matches were confirmed with a visual inspection of 2MASS and WISE images, as well as of their SEDs. After the visual
inspection, a few measurements were discarded as of poor quality (e.g., confused, highly saturated, or strong background emission) and not compatible with the SED. For stars [MMF2014] 46, GLIMPSE9-6, RSGC2-8, RSGC2-14, 2MASS J184517600343051, and 2MASS J18451722-0343136, MSX matches were removed. For stars Cl* Westerlund 1 20, Cl* Westerlund 1 75,
[MMF2014] 46, GLIMPSE9-6, RSGC1-F08, RSGC1-F05, and RSGC1-F01, WISE matches were removed because they are
blended with other sources. For stars [HSD93b] 48, [MNG2014] vdB-H 222 778, [MNG2014] vdB-H 222 664, [MNG2014] vdB-

Notes. The identification number (Id) from 2 is followed by the spectral type and class adopted from literature, Sp(adopt) and Class(adopt), by the area
occupied in the Mbol vs. Teff plot (Area), the Teff value, the intrinsic J-Ks and H-Ks colors, the extinction AKs (JK) and AKs (HK) derived from the JK and
HK colors, the adopted BCKs , the dereddened Ks , Kso , two estimates of bolometric magnitudes, the DM obtained with the distances of Bailer-Jones et al.
(2018), a flag for best near-infrared photometry (Mbol-Q), the dereddened V magnitude, Vo , and the stellar radius (R) estimated with the equation of
Josselin & Plez (2007).
A few AKs values are negative. No extinction correction was applied for these stars.
(a ) For BCK , values are calculated with the formula of Levesque et al. (2005) and a typical error of 0.06 mag is assumed (average difference between the
BCK values of two spectral types).
(b ) The errors on the Kso values are estimated by propagating the photometric errors and the AKs errors.
(c ) The Mbol values are obtained with the BCK , their errors are estimated by propagating the errors on Kso , BCK , and DMs.
(d ) The Mbol2 values are obtained via integration under the SED (see Sect. 3.1). Errors are estimating by lowering the curve by subtracting the photometric
errors, and by lifting up the curve by adding the photometric curve. The DM error is then added by Taylor’s propagation law. (e ) DM is here the distance
module obtained with the Bailer distance. Its error is obtained using the quoted high and low values Bailer-Jones et al. (2018).
( f ) Mbol-Q is set to unity when ̟/σ̟ > 4 and RUWE < 2.7 (889 sources), set to 2 when ̟/σ̟ > 4 and RUWE < 2.7 and JHKs quality flags are A
(2MASS) or B (2MASS) or C (2MASS) or D (2MASS) or M (HST photometry) (see Appendix).

H 222 479, [MMF2014] 78, 2MASS J18410261−0552582, HD 195214, and 2MASS J18392955−0544222 only W4 measurements were removed because sources were too faint or confused at this longer wavelength. For stars 2MASS J173618392217306, RSGC1-F07, RSGC1-F10, RSGC1-F03, 2MASS J18395282-0535172, both W3 and W4 magnitudes were discarded.
For HD 14580 and Cl* Westerlund 1 26, W1 and W2 magnitudes did not fit their SED.
