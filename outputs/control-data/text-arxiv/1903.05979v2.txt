Abstract
While it is still not possible to describe the neural-level connections of the human brain, we can
map the human connectome with several hundred vertices, by the application of diffusion-MRI
based techniques. In these graphs, the nodes correspond to anatomically identified gray matter
areas of the brain, while the edges correspond to the axonal fibers, connecting these areas. In our
previous contributions, we have described numerous graph-theoretical phenomena of the human
connectomes. Here we map the frequent complete subgraphs of the human brain networks: in
these subgraphs, every pair of vertices is connected by an edge. We also examine sex differences
in the results. The mapping of the frequent subgraphs gives robust substructures in the graph: if
a subgraph is present in the 80% of the graphs, then, most probably, it could not be an artifact of
the measurement or the data processing workflow. We list here the frequent complete subgraphs
of the human braingraphs of 414 subjects, each with 463 nodes, with a frequency threshold of
80%, and identify 812 complete subgraphs, which are more frequent in male and 224 complete
subgraphs, which are more frequent in female connectomes.

Introduction
Diffusion MRI-based macroscopic mapping of the connections of the human brain is a technology that was developed in the last 15 years [1, 2, 3, 4]. Applying the method, we are able to
construct braingraphs, or connectomes, from the diffusion MRI images [1, 5, 6]: the vertices of
the graph are anatomically labeled areas of the gray matter (called “Regions of Interests”, ROIs),
and two such ROIs are connected by an edge, if a complex workflow, involving either deterministic or probabilistic tractography, finds axonal fibers between the two ROIs. Therefore, one can
construct graphs, with up to 1015 nodes and several thousand edges, from the MR image of each
subject.
The analysis of these graphs is a fast-developing and an important area today: these connections form the “hardware” of all brain functions on a macroscopic level [2, 3, 4]. Naturally,
it would be exciting to map the neuronal scale human connectome, too: here the nodes were
the individual neurons, and two nodes (or neurons), say X and Y, would be connected by a directed edge, say (X, Y ), if the axon of X were connected to a dendrite of Y . Unfortunately, to
date, the neural-level connectome of only one adult organism is described: that of the nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans with 302 neurons, in the year 1986 [7]. In larval state, two more neuronal
level connectomes are published: the larva of the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster [8], and the
tadpole larva of the Ciona intestinalis [9]. Despite of some exciting, very recent developments
[10], the complete connectome of the adult Drosophila melanogaster with 100,000 neurons, is not

determined yet. Humans have 80 billion neurons in their brains. Therefore, the mapping and the
analysis of the neuronal scale human connectome is out of our reach today.
There are numerous results published for the analysis of the diffusion MRI-computed human connectomes, e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4]. Our research group has also contributed some more graphtheoretically oriented analytical methods, like the comparison of the deep graph theoretical parameters of male and female connectomes [11, 12, 13], the parameterizable human consensus
connectome [14, 15], the description of the individual variability in the connections of the major
lobes [16], the discovery of the Consensus Connectome Dynamics [17, 18, 19, 20] the description
of the frequent subgraphs of the human brain [21], and the Frequent Neighborhood Mapping of
the human hippocampus [22].
The reasons of our graph-theoretical approach are listed as follows:
(i) Graph theory has a long history of great successes, starting with the paper of Leonhard
Euler in 1741 on Königsberg’s bridges [23].
(ii) “Pure mathematical” graph theory and its applications in computer engineering reached an
exceptionally high level of development in the late XXth and in the early XXIst century, just
mentioning three famous examples: the Strong Perfect Graph Theorem [24], Szemerédi’s
Regularity Lemma [25], and the intricate parallel algorithms for multiprocessor routing in
[26].
(iii) Graph theoretical definitions and notations are well-developed, clear, and usually catch the
deep and most relevant properties of the networks examined.
Frequent edges and subgraphs: a robust analysis
The data acquisition and processing workflow, whose results are the braingraphs or structural
connectomes, has numerous delicate steps. Naturally, errors may occur in MRI recordings and
processing, as well as in segmentation, parcellation, tractography and graph computation steps
[1, 27, 28]. When we have hundreds of high-quality MR images, we can analyze the frequently
appearing graph edges or subgraphs, in order to derive robust, reproducible results, appearing
in high fraction of the brains imaged. By analyzing only the frequently appearing structural
elements, the great majority of data acquisition and processing errors will be filtered out.
Our first effort for describing frequent edges in human connectome was the construction of
the Budapest Reference Connectome Server [14, 15], in which the user can select the frequency
threshold k% of the edges, and the resulting consensus connectome contains only those edges,
which are present in at least k% of the subjects. The generated consensus connectome can be
both visualized and downloaded at the site https://pitgroup.org/connectome/.
The frequent, connected subgraphs of at most 6 edges are mapped in the human connectome
in [21]. The frequencies were compared between female and male connectomes, and strong sex
differences were identified: there are connected subgraphs, which are significantly more frequent
in males than in females, and there are a higher number of connected graphs that are more
frequent in females than in males.
The direct connections of important brain areas are of special interest: correlations between
the present or missing connections and psychological tests results or biological parameters may
enlighten the fine structure-function relations of our brain. For error-correction reasons, the
frequent neighbors of the relevant brain areas form the robust objects of study: small errors in
the data processing workflow will most probably have no effects on the frequent connections. In
our work [22], we have introduced the method of the Frequent Neighborhood Mapping, which
describes the frequent neighbor sets of the given nodes of the braingraph. In [22], we have
demonstrated the method by mapping the frequent neighborhoods of the human hippocampus:
one of the most deeply studied part of the brain. We have mapped the frequent neighbor sets
2

of the hippocampus, and we have found sex differences in the frequent neighbor sets: males
have much more frequent neighbor sets of the hippocampus than the females; therefore, the
neighborhoods of the men’s hippocampi are more regular, with less variability than those of
women. This observation is in line with the results of [11, 12, 13], where we have shown that the
female connectomes are better expander graphs than the braingraphs of men.
In the present contribution, we are mapping the frequent complete graphs of the human
connectome, based on the large dataset of the Human Connectome Project [29]. Our dataset
contains the braingraphs of 414 subjects. A recently appeared work [30] deals with complete
subgraphs in braingraphs of 8 subjects, each with 83 nodes. Our results are derived from 414
braingraphs, each of 463 nodes. Therefore, we are able to find frequent structures, i.e., frequent
complete subgraphs in our dataset of 414 graphs (while it is not feasible to derive frequent
structures from 8 graphs).
Cliques vs. complete subgraphs
Here we intend to clarify some graph theoretical
terms. A complete graph on v vertices

contains (undirected) edges, connecting all the v2 = v(v−1)/2 vertex-pairs: that is, in a complete
graph, each pair of vertices are connected by an edge.
If we have a graph G on n vertices, we can look for the complete subgraphs H of G: all the
vertices and the edges of H need to be vertices and edges of G (i.e., H is a subgraph of G), and,
moreover, H needs to be a complete graph.
The complete subgraph of the maximum vertex-number of G is called a clique. The clique
number of graph G, ω(G), is the number of vertices in the largest complete subgraph of G.
Computing the clique number ω(G) is a well-known hard problem: it is NP-hard [31], that is, it
is not probable that one could find a fast (i.e., polynomial-time) algorithm for computing ω(G).
Moreover, in general, not only the exact value of ω(G) is hard to compute, but it is also very
difficult to approximate, even roughly [32]. In special cases, however, when the number of the
vertices is only several hundred, and the graph is not too dense, that is, it has not too many edges,
then all the frequently appearing complete subgraphs can be computed relatively quickly by the
apriori algorithm [33, 34]. The computational details are given in the Materials and Methods
section.
Our goal in the present contribution is to map the frequently appearing complete subgraphs in
human connectomes. We need to make clear that our analysis is done on 463-vertex braingraphs.
Therefore, if a complete subgraph is found, it does not imply the neuronal level existence of
complete subgraphs. It implies, however, that the macroscopic ROIs, corresponding to the vertices
of the complete graphs discovered, are connected densely to each another, probably even on the
neuronal level.
In the literature one may find numerous references to the “rich club property” of some networks,
related to the braingraph [35, 36]. Here we prefer using classical graph theoretical terms instead
of this “rich club property”, consequently, we intend to map those densely connected subgraphs
of the human connectomes, which form complete graphs, and appear in at least the 80% of the
all braingraphs considered.
Discussion and Results
First we review the frequent complete subgraphs of the human braingraph, next we analyze
the significant differences in their frequencies in males and in females.

Frequent complete subgraphs of the human connectome
Supporting Table S1 contains the complete subgraphs of the human connectomes appearing in
at least 80% of the graphs of the 414 subjects examined. In each row, the vertices of the complete
subgraphs are listed, together with their frequencies of appearance. Note, that the vertices of a
complete graph uniquely determine its edges. The list is redundant in the following sense: if a
k-vertex complete graph has frequency at least 80%, then all of its complete subgraphs are also
listed. We find that this redundancy helps in the analysis of the results, as it will be clear from
what follows.
We would like to emphasize the following very simple, but powerful fact: If a given subgraph
U has a frequency, say `%, then all subgraphs of U has frequency at least `%. This is the central
point in the apriori algorithm [33, 34], and it was noted and applied in [21, 22].
The ROIs in Table S1 carry the names of the resolution-250 parcellation labels
(where the number 250 refers to the approximate number of vertices in each hemisphere;
the graphs of resolution-250 contain 465 vertices, not just 250), based on the Lausanne 2008 brain atlas [37] and computed by using FreeSurfer [38] and CMTK [39, 5],
given at https://github.com/LTS5/cmp_nipype/blob/master/cmtklib/data/parcellation/
lausanne2008/ParcellationLausanne2008.xls. The “lh” and the “rh” prefixes abbreviate the
“left-hemisphere” and “right-hemisphere” terms of localizations.
Complete subgraphs appearing in each subject
Here we list the maximal complete subgraphs from supporting Table S1, which are present in
all of the braingraphs, and contains at least three nodes:
L1:
L2:
L3:
R1:
R2:
R3:
R4:

(Left-Caudate)(Left-Pallidum)(Left-Putamen)(Left-Thalamus-Proper),
(Left-Hippocampus)(Left-Putamen)(Left-Thalamus-Proper),
(Left-Putamen)(Left-Thalamus-Proper)(lh.insula 1)
(Right-Caudate)(Right-Pallidum)(Right-Putamen)(Right-Thalamus-Proper)
(Right-Hippocampus)(Right-Putamen)(Right-Thalamus-Proper)
(Right-Putamen)(Right-Thalamus-Proper)(rh.insula 2)
(rh.superiorfrontal 7)(rh.superiorfrontal 8)(rh.superiorfrontal 9)

Note that L1 and L2 correspond to R1 and R2, and L3 almost corresponds to R3. Complete
graph R4 has no correspondence in the left hemisphere (which are present in each subject), but
in the left hemisphere, the superiorfrontal regions are also connected densely, as one can verify
easily from Table S1.
We believe that the connections between the above-listed areas are very strong in each subject:
so strong that they are not affected by measurement errors and individual variability.
The largest frequent complete subgraphs
The largest complete subgraphs, which are present in at least the 80% of the subjects, have
seven vertices, and they are located in the left hemisphere. The first one connects the left putamen
with six vertices in the left frontal lobe (B1), the second one connects the left caudate and the
left putamen ROIs to five left frontal areas (B2):
B1:
(Left-Putamen) (lh.lateralorbitofrontal 4) (lh.lateralorbitofrontal 6) (lh.lateralorbitofrontal 7)
(lh.parstriangularis 3) (lh.rostralmiddlefrontal 12) (lh.rostralmiddlefrontal 9)
(lh.medialorbitofrontal 2)
B2:
(Left-Caudate)
(Left-Putamen)
(lh.lateralorbitofrontal 7)
(lh.rostralanteriorcingulate 1) (lh.rostralmiddlefrontal 12) (lh.rostralmiddlefrontal 9)
There are 48 different 6-vertex complete subgraphs, which are present in at least 80% of the connectomes. Only 6 of these are situated in the right hemisphere, the other 42 are in the left hemisphere.

right hippocampus and the right amygdala are present in much more complete subgraphs than the left ones; the
left thalamus-proper, the left putamen and the left pallidum are present in much more complete subgraphs than
the right ones.

Complete subgraphs across the hemispheres
Since the neural fiber tracts, connecting the two hemispheres of the brain, are very dense in the corpus
callosum, their tractography in the diffusion MR images is difficult since the fiber-crossings cannot always
be tracked reliably [40, 41].
We have found only relatively few frequent complete subgraphs of the human connectome, which have
nodes from both hemispheres. Here we list those, which are present in more than 80% of the braingraphs
studied; therefore, they are most probably not false positives. Again, we are listing only the maximal
complete subgraphs for clarity. We note that most ROIs in the list are the parts of the striatum: each
complete subgraph contains either a caudate nucleus or a nucleus accumbens of either the right- or the
left hemisphere:

(Left-Caudate)(Right-Caudate)(rh.rostralanteriorcingulate 2)
(Left-Thalamus-Proper)(Right-Accumbens-area)(Right-Thalamus-Proper)

Counts of the hippocampus, thalamus, putamen, pallidum and the amygdala in the frequent complete subgraphs
In this section we count the appearances of certain ROIs in the frequent complete subgraphs, with
a frequency threshold of 80%. Our results show that there are considerable differences between the
hemispheres in these numbers: The right hippocampus and the right amygdala are present in much more
complete subgraphs than the left ones; the left thalamus-proper, the left putamen and the left pallidum
are present in much more complete subgraphs than the right ones (Table 1).

Sex differences
Mapping sex differences in the human connectome is a hot and fast-developing area of research. In
our earlier works we have shown - first in the literature - that in numerous well-defined graph theoretical
parameters, women have “better connected” braingraphs than men [11, 12, 13]. In the work [21] we have
mapped the frequent subgraphs of the human brain of at most 6 vertices, and have found sex differences:
there are numerous frequent connected subgraphs, which are more frequent in men than in women, and,
similarly, which are more frequent in men than in women. In the study of [22], we have mapped the
neighbor-sets of the human hippocampus and found also significant sex differences in these sets.
Here we compare the frequencies of the complete subgraphs of the connectomes of men and women.
We have found significant differences in the frequencies of some complete subgraphs, with the advantage
at men and women, too.

5

We have found much more complete subgraphs with significantly higher frequency in men than in
women. More exactly, Supporting Table S2 lists 224 complete subgraphs, with significantly higher frequency in females than in males, while Table S3 lists 812 complete subgraphs, where their frequencies in
males were higher than in females (with p=0.01, and the inclusion threshold was a minimum 80% for the
larger frequency).
This observation, in a sense, shows that men’s connectomes show less inter-personal variability in
complete subgraphs than those of women. This observation is in contrast with our findings in [21], where
we have shown that women have much more 6-vertex frequent subgraphs than men: but in [21] we
required connectedness, and not completeness.

Figure 1: A complete subgraph with four vertices, which is present in all 414 human connectomes examined. The
vertices of the depicted subgraph are Right-Caudate, Right-Pallidum, Right-Putamen, Right-Thalamus-Proper.
The supporting Table S1 contains all the complete subgraphs with frequency of at least 80%, Table S2 contains
the complete subgraphs, where the frequency of their appearance in females is significantly higher (p=0.01) than
in males; Table S3 contains those, where the frequency is significantly higher in males than in females. The
supporting tables are available at http://uratim.com/cliques/tables.zip.

Materials and Methods
The Data Source and the Graph Computation
The data source of the present study is the website of the Human Connectome Project at the address
http://www.humanconnectome.org/documentation/S500 [29]. The dataset contains the HARDI MRI
data of healthy human young adults between the ages of 22 and 35 years.
The CMTK toolkit [5], together with the FreeSurfer tool and the MRtrix tractography processing tool [42] were applied in the graph generation. In the MRtrix tool, we have applied ran-

6

domized seeding and deterministic streamline method, with 1 million streamlines. We have studied here graphs with 463-vertex resolution. The parcellation data is given in the CMTK nypipe
GitHub repository https://github.com/LTS5/cmp_nipype/blob/master/cmtklib/data/parcellation/
lausanne2008/ParcellationLausanne2008.xls.
Further particularities of the graph processing workflow are described in [6], where the http://
braingraph.org repository is also given. The braingraphs, analyzed here, can be accessed at the https:
//braingraph.org/cms/download-pit-group-connectomes/ site, choosing the “Full set, 413 brains, 1
million streamlines” option.

The Algorithm
In general, in a graph G, finding the size of the largest complete subgraph, called the clique-number,
and denoted by ω(G), is a hard problem: it is NP-hard [31]. Naturally, finding the largest complete
subgraph itself cannot be easier than finding its size ω(G); therefore, it is also hard.
Finding the largest complete subgraphs in sparse graphs (i.e., graphs with relatively few edges, compared to the number of its vertices) is usually not a very difficult task, since in these graphs, regularly,
there are not too many large complete subgraphs. Finding only the frequently appearing complete subgraphs further simplifies the computational tasks, and we can apply an algorithm, which resembles in
many points to the apriori algorithm for finding frequent item sets [34, 33], and this algorithm is very
fast in the practice.
Now we describe the algorithm: A frequent complete subgraph is characterized by the list of its
vertices and the set of its edges. At the beginning, for an (undirected) edge (vi , vj ), let these two lists be
given as ([vi , vj ], {(vi , vj )}), where i < j.
In general, the vertices of the complete subgraphs are listed in the increasing order of their indices,
and the vertices of each edge are listed also in the increasing order of its indices; otherwise, the particular
order of the edges is indifferent, since they are elements of an unordered set, and they are stored also as
a set.
Now we describe the generating, “apriori” step. Let
L1 = ([v1 , v2 , ..., vk ], {(v1 , v2 ), (v1 , v3 ), ...(vk−1 , vk )})
and
L2 = ([u1 , u2 , ..., uk ], {(u1 , u2 ), (u1 , u3 ), ...(uk−1 , uk )})
be two frequent complete subgraphs of size k. If the first k − 1 vertices of L1 and L2 are the same,
and the last ones differ, we will consider generating a new, k + 1-vertex complete graph, as follows: if
v1 = u1 , v2 = u2, ...vk−1 = uk−1 and vk 6= uk , then, by the notation vk+1 = uk , we verify the suitable
frequency of the complete graph L = ([v1 , v2 , ...vk , vk+1 ], {(v1 , v2 ), (v1 , v3 ), ...(vk , vk+1 )}).
It is easy to see that in the edge list only the last one, (vk , vk+1 ) is new, all the others are already the
edges of the frequent subgraphs L1 or L2 .
In generating L one needs to make sure that the vertices in the vertex-list are ordered by their indices,
and that the frequency of L is above the inclusion threshold.
The apriori generating step is correct, since if L is frequent, then both L1 and L2 were frequent.
Additionally, every k + 1-vertex complete graph is generated only once, since the vertices are in increasing
order: (v1 , v2 , . . . , vk+1 ) can be generated only from (v1 , ...vk ) and (v1 , ...vk−1 , vk+1 ).

Statistical Notes
The frequent complete subgraphs were chosen in the following way:
First, the subjects were partitioned into two disjoint sets, by the parity of their ID number’s second
digit from the right. Next, in both sets, the complete graphs with the minimum frequency of 80% were
identified, as it was described in the previous section. Only those complete subgraphs were retained,
which have had a minimum frequency of 80% in both sets under consideration. Then the frequency of
these subgraphs were re-calculated for the whole dataset: these frequencies are given in the supplementary
tables.
In the computation of sex differences, we have applied χ2 tests to identify significant differences in
the frequencies of the complete subgraphs. Our null hypothesis was that the frequencies are the same

7

in males and females, and we refute this hypothesis with p=0.01. The secondary statistical errors were
handled by Holm-Bonferroni corrections [43]. The un-corrected and the corrected p values are listed in
supplementary Tables S2 and S3.

Conclusions
By an apriori-like algorithm, we have mapped the frequent (>80%) complete subgraphs of 414 subjects, each with 463 vertices. The largest frequent complete subgraph has 7 vertices. Most of the largest
frequent subgraphs are located in the left hemisphere. We have also identified the frequent complete
subgraphs, containing vertices from both hemispheres, and identified complete subgraphs with significant
frequency-differences between the sexes. We have found that men have much more frequent complete
subgraphs than women: this result contrasts our earlier finding [11], where we have shown that women
have much better connectivity-related parameters in their connectomes than men in a following sense:
while women have better connected braingraphs than men (as it is very precisely described in [11]), the
dense subgraphs of men show less inter-individual variability than in women.
