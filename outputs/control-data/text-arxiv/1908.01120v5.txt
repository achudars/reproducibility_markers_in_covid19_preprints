Entangled resources enable quantum sensing that achieves Heisenberg scaling, a quadratic improvement on the standard quantum limit, but preparing large N spin entangled states is challenging in the presence of decoherence. We present a quantum control strategy using highly nonlinear
geometric phase gates which can be used for generic state or unitary synthesis on the Dicke subspace with O(N ) or O(N 2 ) gates respectively. The method uses a dispersive coupling of the spins
to a common bosonic mode and does not require addressability, special detunings, or interactions
between the spins. By using amplitude amplification our control sequence for preparing states ideal
for metrology can be significantly simplified to O(N 5/4 ) geometric phase gates with parameters that
are more robust to mode decay. The geometrically closed path of the control operations ensures
the gates are insensitive to the initial state of the mode and the sequence has built-in dynamical
decoupling providing resilience to dephasing errors.

Introduction.— Quantum enhanced sensing offers the
possibility of using entanglement in an essential way to
measure fields with a precision superior to that which
can be obtained with unentangled resources [1–4]. Entangled resources allow the measurement sensitivity to
scale as 1/N with respect to the resources applied
√ (socalled Heisenberg scaling), compared to the 1/ N obtained otherwise (the standard quantum limit, or shotnoise limit) [4–6].
Creating large-scale entanglement in multipartite systems for the purposes of metrology is a difficult problem for a number of reasons. There is the difficulty in
precisely constructing the required quantum state using
realistic quantum operations, the need to protect that
quantum state from decoherence and loss [7], and the
problem of carrying out a number of quantum measurement operations on the state with precise control.
From a metrology perspective, there is also the issue
that many schemes claim to achieve Heisenberg limit by
virtue of quadratic scaling of the Fisher information of
the system [8]. While this ensures that there is an observable which has an uncertainty that scales as 1/N with
respect to some resource, it does not specify what that
observable is, or require it be a convenient experimentally measurable quantity. There have been attempts to
address these problems in various ways. For example,
to mitigate the decoherence issue, recent work has suggested using quantum error correction assisted metrology (see [9] and references therein) or phase protected
metrology [10]. Such workarounds require the ability to
perform complex quantum control in the former case or
engineered interactions in the latter.
Here we present a state preparation scheme and measurement protocol using geometric phase gates generalizing Ref. [11]. Our protocol addresses the issues of state
preparation, decoherence protection, and choice of measurement operator. It is relatively simple to engineer as
it involves only the coupling of an ensemble of qubits to
a common bosonic mode, e.g. a cavity or mechanical oscillation, as well as simple global control pulses on the

spins and mode. As such it is adaptable to a variety of
architectures at the forefront of quantum control including NV centres in diamond, trapped ion arrays, Rydberg
atoms, and superconducting qubits.
Unlike previous work our scheme does not require special engineering of the physical layout of the spins, special
detunings for adiabatic state preparation, addressability,
or direct interaction between the spins. Furthermore,
it exceeds the performance of spin squeezing protocols
because of the highly nonlinear nature of the geometric
phase gates used. Another advantage is that due to the
geometric nature of the gate, it is completely insensitive
to variations or uncertainties in the rate at which the
perimeter is traversed.
Furthermore, our protocol has dynamical decoupling
built in, providing resilience against dephasing during
the state preparation, which is the dominant source of
noise in many physical implementations. While dynamical decoupling has been considered [12] in the context
of the Møllmer-Sørenson geometric gate [13], our scheme
extends this to a highly nonlinear geometric phase gate
and a full quantum state preparation algorithm.
Method.— We consider a collection of two-level
spin half systems, and define the collective raising
and
angular momentum operators as J + =
PN lowering
+
−
= (J + )† , and the components of the total
j=1 σj , J
angular momentum P
vector are J x = (J + + J − )/2, J y =
+
−
z
(J − J )/2i, J = j (|0ij h0| − |1ij h1|)/2. Dicke states
are simultaneous eigenstates of angular momentum J and
J z : |J = N/2, J z = M i, M = −J, . . . , J.
Consider the measurement of a field which generates
a collective spin rotation about an axis perpendicular to
ẑ given by U (η) = exp [iη(J x sin δ + J y cos δ)]. For a
measurement operator O on the system, the single shot
estimation of the parameter η has variance
(∆η)2 =

(∆O(η))2
.
|∂η hO(η)i|2

(1)

When the measured observable is O = J z 2 , the parame-

2
ter variance is [14]
(∆η)2 = (∆J x 2 )2 f (η) + 4hJ x 2 i − 3hJ y 2 i − 2hJ z 2 i

× (1 + hJ x 2 i) + 6hJ z J x 2 J z i (4(hJ x 2 i − hJ z 2 i)2 )−1

Assuming the number of spins n is even, we consider

The system and the mode are decoupled at the end
of GPG cycle. Also, if the mode begins in the vacuum
state, it ends in the vacuum state and the first operation R(−θJ z ) in Eq. (3) is not needed. In the GPG it is
necessary to evolve by both R(θJ z ) and R(−θJ z ). This
can be done by conjugating with a global flip of the spins
x
x
R(θJ z ) = e−iπJ R(−θJ z )eiπJ , implying that the GPG
can be generated regardless of the sign of the dispersive coupling strength g. Furthermore, because R(±θJ z )
commutes with H0 at all steps, this conjugation will cancel the free evolution accumulated during the GPG.

Note it is not essential that we know the angle δ of the
field direction in the x̂ − ŷ plane [15].
The best known quantum algorithm for deterministically preparing a Dicke state |J, M i requires O((N/2 +
M )N ) gates and has a circuit depth O(N ) [16]. This
works even for a linear nearest neighbour architecture,
but requires a universal gate set and full addressability.
Other proposals exist [17–20], but they all suffer from
drawbacks such as not scaling beyond a few spins, strong
adiabaticity or geometry, contraints, requiring large initial Fock states of motional modes, and couplings causing
transitions outside the Dicke space.
In our setup we assume N spins with homogeneous
energy splittings described by a free Hamiltonian H0 =
ω0 J z which can be controlled by semi-classical fields performing global rotations generated by J x , J y . Additionally, we assume the ensemble is coupled to a single quantized bosonic mode â. Our scheme requires a dispersive
coupling between the n spins and the bosonic mode of
the form V = ga† aJ z .
The geometric phase gate (GPG) makes use of two basic operators [11, 21], the displacement operator D(α) =

gives W (`) = e−iπ|J,`−N/2ihJ,`−N/2| meaning it applies a

For N odd we can use N GPGs with the same angles
θk , φk (`) as above but with χ = 2(Nπ+1) .
Given the control toolbox above of global rotations and the GPGs, one can synthesize an arbitrary
unitary P
operator on the Dicke subspace.

as U =

K(λk ) is any unitary extension of the state synthesis mapping |J, −Ji → |λk i. The phasing unitary
is the same as W (0) but with χ → λk /(N + 1).

gives very accurate results when optimized over the
4N − 4 free parameters {βs , θs , φs , χs } [22]. The overall
complexity in GPG count using this approach is N for
state synthesis and 5N 2 /2 for unitary synthesis.
While the general state synthesis approach above can
be used for building Dicke states, the N − 1 action angles {χs } that optimize state fidelity are O(1) and this
has implications for noise due to mode decay as described below. We now describe a way, based on amplitude amplification, to improve matters by only using the GPGs that appear in W (`) that have action
angles O(1/N ), and with the added advantage of providing an analytical solution to the Dicke state synthesis problem. Starting with all spins down, i.e. in
|J, −Ji, let the target state be |wi = |J, 0i. We will
make use of the operators Uw = e−iπ|wihw| = W (N/2)
y
y
and Us = e−iπ|sihs| = eiJ π/2 W (0)e−iJ π/2 . In total the
operators Uw and Us each use N/2 GPGs. The orbit
of the initial state |si under the operators Uw and Us ,
is restricted to a subspace spanned by the orthonor|si−|wihw|si
mal states |wi and |s0 i = √
, exactly as in

Grover’s algorithm. The composite pulse is one Grover
step UG = Us Uw . Geometrically, relative to the state
|s0 i, the initial state |si is rotated by an angle δ/2 toward |wi, where δ = 2 sin−1 (|hw|si|), and after each

The fidelity overlap of the output state ρ of the protocol
with the target state is F = Tr(|wihw|ρ). For the Grover
method it is easily calculated as
p

F = sin2 ((#G + 1/2)δ) > 1 − 2/πN .
p
While the fidelity error falls off at least as fast as 2/πN
for all N  1, if N is near a value where the argument
in Eq. (4) is a half integer, i.e. d32(2k + 1)4 /π 5 e, with
k ∈ Z, the error will be much lower. For example, at
N = (10, 70, 260, 700, 1552) the fidelity error is (1.84 ×
10−4 , 1.57 × 10−5 , 1.68 × 10−6 , 3.65 × 10−8 , 1.92 × 10−8 ).
The number of GPGs needed to prepare the Dicke state
by the Grover method is c × N 5/4 with a constant c < 1.
The effectiveness of our scheme when used for metrology is shown in Figure 1, which shows the precision ∆η
obtainable as a function of N , compared to that obtained
from both the standard quantum limit and the ultimate
Cramér-Rao bound. It also shows the fidelity obtainable
as a function of the number of spins N . The achievable
fidelity is clearly optimized for specific spin values.
We have focused on preparing the state |J, 0i, but
with simple modifications our protocol can prepare any
Dicke state |J, M i. First use the initial state |si =
y
eiM J |J, −Ji, and second substitute the operators Uw =
y
y
W (M + N/2) and Us = eiM J W (0)e−iM J where M =
cos−1 (M/J). Now the relevant overlap is |hw|si| =
|dJM,−J (−M )|, and for J − |M |  1, |dJM,−J (−)| ≈
√
( πJ sin M )−1/2 [23], implying #G = O(N 1/4 ).
Finally, measurement of J z 2 could be done by again
coupling the spins to the bosonic mode but now with
a linear coupling Vm = gm J z (a† + a) which generates
a mode displacement depending on the collective spin
projection. When the mode is in a number diagonal
state, e.g. a thermal state, with mean excitation number n̄, the measurement of n̂ after a coupling time τ is
hn̂i = n̄ + (gm τ )2 hJ z 2 i. If mode number and quadratic
spin operator measurements are difficult there are alternatives. One is estimation by a classical average over
2
Pp
, where M (k) is
p experiments: E[hJ z 2 i] = k=1 M (k)
p
the outcome of the kth measurement of J z [24]. Another is, after accumulating the signal, one could invert
the state preparation and measure |J, −JihJ, −J| which
gives the same precision scaling as Eq. (1), but doesn’t
require number resolved excitation counts.
There will be errors due to decay of the bosonic mode
during the operations, as well as decoherence due to en-

fidelity. We now address these.
Mode damping.— We treat the mode as an open quantum system with decay rate κ. In order to disentangle the spins from the mode, the third and fourth
displacement stages of the k-th GPG should be modified to D(−αk ) → D(−αk e−κθk /g ) and D(−βk ) →
D(−βk e−κθk /g ). For simplicity we choose |αk | = |βk |.

and ΓM,M 0 and ∆M,M 0 are given in the Supplementary
Material [26].
The full operation is a concatenation of these imperfect
processes E (k) (ρ), and we characterise its accuracy with
the process fidelity Fpro (E, U ), which measures how close
a quantum operation E is to the ideal operation U [28].
For each GPG we can readily find the lower bound on
the process fidelity (see Supplementary Material [26])
Fpro (E, UGPG ) > e−6πχk κ/f (θk )g cos(χk 4πκ/f (θk )g).
Note the scaling of the exponent with 1/N since the action angles χ are O(1/N ). For the composite phasing
map, numerically we find the tighter bound for the fi2
delity Fpro (E, W (`)) > e−π κ/g which is notably independent of N .
Dephasing: We next address spin decoherence. We assume that amplitude damping due to spin relaxation is
small by the choice of encoding. This can be accommodated by choosing qubit states with very long decay times

either as a result of selection rules, or by being far detuned from fast spin exchange transitions. Hence we will
focus on dephasing. Due to the cyclic evolution during
each GPG, there is error tolerance to dephasing because
if the interaction strength between the system and environment is small compared to g, then the spin flip pulses
used between each pair of dispersive gates R(θa† a) will
echo out this noise to low order.
For a given input density matrix ρ(0), the output after a total time T has off-diagonal matrix elements that
0 2
decay as ρM,M 0 (T ) = ρM,M 0 (0)e−(M −M ) A(T ) . For the
global dephasing map the numbers M, M 0 ∈ [−N/2, N/2]
are in the collective Dicke basis, while for local dephasing
it is with respect to a local basis M, M 0 ∈ [−1/2, 1/2].
Our argument for suppression of dephasing works for
both cases. Global dephasing is the most deleterious
form of noise when the state has large support over coherences in the Dicke subspace, due to decay rates that scale
quadratically in the difference in M number. However, it
leaves the total Dicke space, and in particular the target
Dicke state, invariant. Local dephasing induces coupling
outside the Dicke space, but with a rate that is at most
linear in N .
Consider the evolution during the N/2 control pulses
to realize either of the phasing gates Us or Uw . Assuming
Gaussian bath statistics, the effective dephasing rate can
be written as the overlap of the noise spectrum S(ω)
and the filter function |f (ω)|2 [47, 48]. As shown in the
Supplementary material [26], for our pulse sequence to
lowest order in ω/g we find

Comparison with the case where no spin flips are applied
is plotted in Fig. 2 showing there is substantial decoupling from the dephasing environment when the spectral
density has dominant support in the range ω < g/2.
The freedom to apply the GPGs in any order allows
for further improvement. Consider coupling to a zero
temperature Ohmic bath with noise spectrum S(ω) =
αωe−ω/ωc with cutoff frequency ωc /g = 0.1. For N = 20,
the ratio of the effective decay rate for the linearly ordered sequence of GPGs above to that with no decoupling is A(T )/A0 (T ) = 0.0085. However, by sampling
over permutations of the ordering of GPGs we find a sequence [49] achieving A(T )/A0 (T ) = 0.0026. Examples
of the effectiveness of our decoupling protocol on sensitivity for various values of A(T ) are shown in Figure 3.
Effectiveness on the fidelities can be found in the Supplementary Material [26].
Error-tolerant states.— The state preparation method
we have described has inherent tolerance to decoherence.
However once the state is prepared further errors such as
qubit loss or dephasing could accumulate. Strategies to
address this by using superpositions of Dicke states were

steps are given in the Supplementary Material [26]. Superpositions of Dicke states also arise as code words of
so-called permutationally invariant quantum codes [46],
and of recently discovered codes which admit Gaussian
Clifford operations [34] which our method could also prepare.
Implementations.— The scheme we have presented is
amenable to a variety of architectures which allow collective dispersive couplings between spins and an oscillator. These include: trapped Rydberg atoms coupled
to an microwave cavity [35, 36], trapped ions coupled to
a common motional mode [37] or to an optical cavity
mode [38], superconducting qubits coupled to microwave
resonators [39], and NV centres in diamond coupled to a
microwave mode inside a superconducting transmission
line cavity [40].
One contender to test our scheme is Rydberg atoms
coupled to microwave cavities. Recently the dispersive
detection of small atomic Rydberg ensembles coupled to
a high-Q microwave cavity was reported [36]. Their numbers suggest a ratio of κ/g ≈ 0.8 (with κ = 2π × 11.8 kHz
and g = 2π × 14.3 kHz). The collective coupling rate
observed was a few MHz, suggesting an additional pathway to improving γ/g by orders of magnitude by encoding spins through collective subensembles. Consider
an encoding where each spin is composed of n physical spins with logical states |0i = |j = n/2, −ji and
|1i = |j = n/2, −j + 1i, i.e. the permutationally invariant states of zero or one excitation shared among the
n spins. If the spins within each logical qubit interact,
e.g. via dipole-dipole interactions, there will be a dipoleblockade to larger numbers of excitations. Hence collective rotations frequency-tuned to the transition energy
E1 − E0 will be collective but only act on this qubit subspace.√The dispersive interaction strength is enhanced by
g → g n, provided the number n is similar for all logical
spins. Using this kind of encoding, dispersive coupling
with strength g ≈ 2π × 2.2 MHz was obtained with NV
ensembles in diamond bonded onto a transmission line
resonator with quality factor Q ≈ 4300 at the first harmonic frequency ω1 = 2π × 2.75 GHz. Microwave cavities with much higher quality factors, e.g. Q ≈ 109 , have
been realized [42] which for the same dispersive coupling
could provide κ/g ≈ 10−6 .

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Gate fidelity with cavity decay

Cavity field decay at a rate κ acts as a source of error
for the many body interactions which the cavity mode
mediates. Consider the the joint evolution of the spins
and the mode. The coupling of the mode to its environment is treated as irreversible and thus can be described
by the standard master equation in Lindblad form. The
equation of motion for the joint state is

We ignore decay during the displacement stages of the
evolution (i.e. we assume these are done quickly relative
to the decay rate), and we assume that the system particles do not interact with the field during these steps. For
simplicity we evaluate the performance when the cavity
begins in the vacuum state, in which case there are seven
time steps to consider:

with an evolution operator

U = e−i2χ sin(φ+θJ ) ,

D(−β)e−iτ5 V D(−α)eiτ3 V D(β)e−iτ1 V D(α).
Let τ5 = τ3 = τ1 so that the periods of spin field coupling
are all equal in duration. In order that the field state
return to the vacuum at the end of the sequence, we
choose α0 = α−κτ1 , β 0 = β −κτ1 for the parameters of the
second two displacement operators. The total sequence
then yields the output state:

A loose upper bound on precision as function of
fidelity

The precision of the estimation parameter η is expressed as
(∆η)2 = (∆J x 2 )2 f (η) + 4hJ x 2 i − 3hJ y 2 i − 2hJ z 2 i

× (1 + hJ x 2 i) + 6hJ z J x 2 J z i (4(hJ x 2 i − hJ z 2 i)2 )−1
(23)

(20)

To check how the precision scales in relation to the
fidelity, F , we can calculate the precision assuming an
input density matrix, ρ = a|J, 0ihJ, 0| + b1, where |J, 0i
is our ideal Dicke state, 1 is the identity matrix of size
(N + 1) × (N + 1) and a and b are related to fidelity as
a = (1 + 1/N )F − 1/N and b = (1 − F )/N . We choose
this form for the input density matrix so that applying a
global dephasing map to the output state of our protocol would make it diagonal in the |J, M i basis but keep
the population in |J, 0i constant. Assuming the diagonal matrix elements (except the |J, 0ihJ, 0| entry) are
equally weighted is a maximally unbiased assumption.
After calculating the variances and expectation values
of the angular momentum operators as they appear in
Equation (23), then taking the high fidelity limit F → 1
and assuming large N , the precision is found to be
p
(24)
(∆η)2 = 2/(N (N + 2)) + (1 − F )/10,

Here we are computing the overlap of the JamiolkowskiChoi representations of the maps as states in the Hilbert

where 2/(N (N + 2)) is the Cramér-Rao bound. Numerically we find this approximate form is extremely good
for 1 − F < 10−2 .

The process fidelity Fpro (E, U ) measures how close a
quantum operation E is to the ideal operation U as measured by some suitable metric. The fidelity measure we
use is the overlap between the induced JamiolkowskiChoi state representations of the operations. The process fidelity is readily computed using the fact that the
noise map E(ρS (0)) commutes with the target unitary U .
Hence, we can compute the fidelity which measures how
close the noisy map E 0 (ρS (0)) = U † E(ρS (0))U is to the
ideal operation, i.e. the identity operation:
Fpro (E, U ) = Fpro (E 0 , I) =S,S 0 hΦ+ |ρE 0 |Φ+ iS,S 0 .

For our choice of the input density matrix, there appears to be a lower bound to the precision (as a function
of N ) that is set by the fidelity. If we would want the
overall expression to fall off as 1/N 2 , i.e to achieve the
Heisenberg scaling, then we would need the error 1 − F
to scale as 1/N 4 . While this requirement is demanding
in terms of performance, it should be noted that we have
assumed that all the populations in |J, M i, M 6= 0 are
equal when in fact the non-zero terms in the output density matrix are much more concentrated near the target
state |J, 0i for our protocol. As the precision involves
4
terms like expectation values of J z , error terms with
support on states far away from |J, 0i will give large errors. Thus, we are overestimating the error in this case
and this should be viewed as a loose upper bound on the
precision.

Dephasing rates and compensation via dynamical
decoupling

The explicit form of the filter function is
|f (ω)|2 =

Due to the cyclic evolution during each GPG, there
is error tolerance to dephasing because if the interaction
strength between the system and environment is small
compared to g, then the spin flip pulses used between
each pair of dispersive gates R(θa† a) will echo out this
noise to low order.
For a given input density matrix ρ(0), the output after a total time T has off-diagonal matrix elements that
0 2
decay as ρM,M 0 (T ) = ρM,M 0 (0)e−(M −M ) A(T ) . For the
global dephasing map the numbers M, M 0 ∈ [−N/2, N/2]
are in the collective Dicke basis, while for local dephasing
it is with respect to a local basis M, M 0 ∈ [−1/2, 1/2].
Our argument for suppression of dephasing works for
both cases. Global dephasing is the most deleterious
form of noise when the state has large support over coherences in the Dicke subspace, due to decay rates that
scale quadratically in the difference in M number. However, it leaves the total Dicke space, and in particular the
target Dicke state, invariant. In contrast, local dephasing induces coupling outside the Dicke space, but with a
rate that is at most linear in N .
Consider the evolution during the N/2 control pulses
to realize either of the phasing gates Us or Uw . Assuming
Guassian bath statistics, the effective dephasing rate can
be written as the overlap of the noise spectrum S(ω) and
the filter function |f (ω)|2 (see e.g. [47, 48]):

In comparison, consider evolution where no spin flips
are applied during the sequence, in which case the bare
functions are C (0) (t) = 1∀t ∈ [0, T ), and |f (0) (ω)|2 =
4 sin2 (T ω/2)/ω 2 . Results are plotted in Fig. 3 in the
main paper and show there is substantial decoupling from
the dephasing environment when the spectral density has
dominant support in the range ω < g/2. For 2πkω/g 
1, the summands in f (ω) can be expanded in a Taylor
series in ω/g and to lowest order we find
g 2 |f (ω)|2 ≈

This approximation is valid for ω/g < 1/πN , and,
as shown in Fig. 3 in the main paper, for 1/πN <
ω/g < 1/2 the function is essentially flat with an average value g 2 |f (ω)|2 ≈ 3 independent of N . In the region 1/πN < ω/g < 1/2 the bare filter function is oscillatory and has an average g 2 |f (0) (ω)|2 ≈ 13.63, while

≈ 0.22, provided the noise

spectrum is sufficiently flat there. The effectiveness of
this decoupling on precision and state precision fidelity
is shown in Figure 4.
Further, the aforementioned freedom to apply the
GPGs in any order allows room for further improvement.

ratio of the effective decay rate for the linearly ordered

A(T )/A0 (T ) = 0.0085. However, by sampling over permutations of the ordering of GPGs we find a sequence
[49] achieving A(T )/A0 (T ) = 0.0026.

Preparation of error-tolerant states

The state preparation method we have described so far
has some inherent tolerance to decoherence. However,
once the state is prepared, further errors could accumulate such as qubit loss or dephasing, while waiting for the
accumulation of the measurement signal. Some strategies
to address this were recently proposed in Ref. [44] where

Here the number of spins N = k × n × u, and the parameters u and n determine the robustness of the states
to some number of loss and dephasing errors respectively,
while k is a parameter to scale the number of qubits in the
superposition (larger k means better performance). The
case u = 1 tolerates erasure errors; specifically, the state
|ϕ1 i has a large quantum Fisher information obeying
Heisenberg scaling when the number of erasure errors is
less than n. We will consider the state performing well in
the presence of one erasure error: u = 1, n = 2, k = N/2,
which can be written
√
1
(27)
|ϕ1 i = (|J, −Ji + 2|J, 0i + |J, Ji).
2
The case u = 2 tolerates a constant number of dephasing errors. We will focus on the state with u = 2, n =
1, k = N/2 which tolerates one dephasing error and can
be written
1
|ϕ2 i = √ (|J, −Ji + |J, 0i).
2

(28)

We now describe how to make these states using our
protocol. A key ingredient to prepare a superposition of
Dicke states is to perform a controlled state preparation.
If we introduce an ancilla spin A which can be allowed
to couple to the mode when the other spins do not (e.g.
by detuning the other spins far away from the dispersive
coupling regime), then a controlled displacements of the
mode can be done:
Λ(β) = |0iA h0| ⊗ 1 + |1iA h1| ⊗ D(β)
= D(β/2)R(π|1iA h1|)D(−β/2)R(−π|1iA h1|).
(29)
†
Here R(π|1iA h1|) = eiπa a|1iA h1| , meaning only the ancilla state |1iA couples to the mode. Now replacing the
displacements D(β) and D(−β) with the controlled displacements Λ(β) and Λ(−β), the effect is a controlled
GPG (see also Ref [45]):
Λ(UGPG ) = |0iA h0| ⊗ 1 + |1iA h1| ⊗ UGPG .

(30)

Thus by simply replacing all instances of GPGs with controlled GPS we can achieve a controlled Grover step uniy
tary G. Note the unitary eiJ π/2 conjugating W (0) in
Us does not need to be controlled, meaning the entire
#G
unitary UG
can be made into a controlled unitary
#G
Λ(UG
) = (|0iA h0| ⊗ 1 + |1iA h1| ⊗ UG )#G .

(31)

This is not quite enough. The state preparation of a
#G
Dicke states described above applies UG
to a particular

10
initial state, namely the spin coherent state |si. We will
also require a way to perform a controlled rotation on all

Without having direction interactions between the ancilla and the other spins it is not obvious how to do this.
However, it is possible to mediate the interaction with
the mode by choosing φ = 0 and θ  1 in one instance
