Introduction
In the previous paper we considered polynomials of binomial type, i.e. the sequences of polynomials

Pn
n
with property pn (α + β) =
k=0 k pk (α)pn−k (β), which we call associated to formal power series
f (x) ∈ x + x2 C[[x]], if the property f (∂/∂α)pn (α) = npn−1 (α) holds (such a series always exists for polynomials of binomial type, see [Dlt]). Also, we studied their canonical continuations to the complex index.
Particularly, we were interested in polynomials νn (α), associated to the function xeEi(x)−ln |x|−γ , and
having the property ανn′ (α − 1) = nνn (α). As it was demonstrated, this property is the direct corollary
of the fact, that the function xe−x is the image of the function xeEi(x)−ln |x|−γ under the transformation
T: f → f /f ′ . Given the potential benefits, the author suggested to look at the sequences of the form
... → f → f /f ′ → f f ′ /(f ′2 − f f ′′ ) → ..., which we call T-chains.
In Section 1 the general question about “eigenfunctions” of nonlinear operator T is raised, which was solved
in a particular case of periodic T-chains in the previous paper.
In Section 2 possible ways to generalize the trivial identity (ln α)′ = α−1 in the domain of continuations
of binomial polynomials are discussed.
In the final third section we provide a different perspective on polynomials of binomial type of integer
index, based on the properties of “derivation” and “shift” operators. We then apply the acquired knowledge
to obtain new formulae for the Taylor series of function (xeEi(x)−ln |x|−γ )inv .

On the equation Tf (x) =

f (px)
p

In this section we study the equation f (x)/f ′ (x) = f (px)/p in the domain x + x2 C[[x]].
As it was demonstrated in the previous paper, in case p = −1 the solution of this equation
takes the form f (x) = (eAx − 1)/A for some constant A, since from the condition p = −1
it follows that T2 f = f , which means the T-chain for such f is periodic, and hence it must
be the series of exponent. This section is divided into several parts. At first, we provide
the main properties of solutions of this equation. Then the particular cases p2 = −2 and
p4 = −4 are considered. And finally, we discuss general properties of the supplementary
series ϕn (x), which are defined below.
The main properties of solutions
Proposition 1.1.
Tf (x) =

f (px)
⇒ ∃n ∈ N : pn = −n
p

(1.1)

Proof : Suppose such f (x) is nontrivial, i.e. there exists the least n > 1, such that the
coefficient of xn+1 is not equal to zero. The first n terms of the series f (x) determine the
first n terms of the series Tf , thus
f ≈ x + αxn+1 ⇒ Tf ≈ x − nαxn+1
But
Tf ≈ x + αpn xn+1 , α 6= 0 ⇒ pn = −n
Proposition 1.2. Suppose f ≈ x + αxn+1 . Then it follows that
Tf (x) =

f (px)
⇒ f (x) = x + A1 xn+1 + A2 x2n+1 + ...
p
for some Ai .

(1.2)

Proof : Suppose f (x) = x + B1 x2 + B2 x3 + .... Then, since f ′ (x)f (px) = pf (x), we have
the following relation
Bk (k + pk ) = −

k−1
X

(m + 1)pk−m Bm Bk−m

m=1

As it is assumed, we have B1 = B2 = ... = Bn−1 = 0, and Bn is the first nonzero
coefficient. Then it follows from the recurrence relation that Bn (n + pn ) = 0. We put
A1 := Bn . Now notice that since n + pn = 0, we have k + pk 6= 0 ∀k > n. That
means Bn+1 , Bn+2 , ..., B2n−1 are equal to zero as the sums of zero components. So the first
nontrivial relation is B2n (2n + p2n ) = −Bn2 pn (n + 1). 2n + p2n 6= 0, hence the coefficient
A2 := B2n is determined by Bn . Similarly, B2n+1 , B2n+2 , ..., B3n−1 are equal to zero as the
sums of zero components, and the next nontrivial component is Bn B2n , which takes place
in the expansion of B3n . Using the same argument on each step, we obtain that f (x) is of
the form x + A1 xn+1 + A2 x2n+1 + ... for some Ai .

Proposition 1.3.
Tf (x) =

f (px) n
, p = −n, f (x) = x + A1 xn+1 + A2 x2n+1 + ...
p

Then the following holds:
(k − (−n)k−1 )Ak =

k−1
X

(nm + 1)(−n)k−m−1 Am Ak−m

(1.3)

m=1

Proof : Take the recurrence relation for the coefficients of f , obtained in the previous
proposition, and exclude the terms, whose indices are not divisible by n. Substituting
pn = −n and dividing by −n, we obtain the desired result.
So the first few terms in the expansion look like this:
f (px) n
, p = −n ⇒
p
n + 1 2 2n+1 (n + 1)(n2 − n − 1) 3 3n+1
⇒ f (x) = x + Axn+1 +
A x
+
A x

n+2
(n + 2)(n2 − 3)
(n + 1)(n6 − 2n4 + 4n3 − n2 − 6n − 2) 4 4n+1
+
A x
+ ...
(n + 2)2 (n2 − 3)(n3 + 4)

Tf (x) =

for some A. Let us denote this expression by fn (A1/n x)/A1/n .
Since in case n = 1, this series turns into (e2Ax − 1)/2A, it is interesting to look at coefficients of x/f (x), as a sort of generalization of the generating function of Bernoulli numbers.
Proposition 1.4. Suppose A1/n x/fn (A1/n x) =
following relation holds true:
k−1

(k − (−n)

)Bk =

k−1
X

P∞

k=0 Bk x

nk .

Then B1 = −A, and the

(−n)m−1 Bm Bk−m

(1.4)

m=1

d 1
Proof : The equality for B1 is obvious. Taking the action of −x2 dx
x on the series x/f (x),
we obtain the recurrence relation.

So the first few terms look like:
A1/n x
A2 x2n
A3 (n − 1)x3n
A4 (n4 − n2 + 4n − 2)x4n
n
=1
−
Ax

(n + 2)(n2 − 3)

A5 (n − 1)(n2 + 2)(n4 − n2 + 3n − 1)x5n
+ ...
−
(n + 2)2 (n2 − 3)(n3 + 4)(n4 − 5)
One may notice, that altought it is quite easy to calculate the coefficients of considered
series, it is hard to recognise any pattern in their behaviour (compared to the case n = 1).
In order to promote greater understanding of the operator T, we suggest to consider the
action of its conjugate QTQ, where by Q we denote the operator (·)inv (f (f inv (x)) = x) for
conciseness of notation. It should be noted, that − ln(1− x) is the image of ln(1 + x) under
its action, and arctan(x) is the image of arcsin(x). Such an approach allows us to link together the solutions of equations Tf (x) = 1p f (px) and TQf (x) = 1p f (px), and here is why.

(1.5)

ϕ2 = (g2 )inv , i.e.

QTQ

ϕ1 −−−−→ ϕ2

Then it follows that x(ϕ1 )′ = g2 (ϕ1 ) ⇒ (x(ϕ1 )′ )inv = g1 (ϕ2 ). Hence T(x(ϕ1 )′ )inv =
= g2 (ϕ2 )/(ϕ2 )′ = x/(ϕ2 )′ ⇒ (ϕ2 )′ = x/T(x(ϕ1 )′ )inv
Observation 1.2: If pn (α) is a sequence of polynomials of binomial type, then for any α:

This statement immediately follows from the Lagrange inversion theorem [Lag]:

And so this statement is true not only for polynomials of binomial type, generated by eαϕ(x) ,
but for any sequence of polynomials, generated by (ϕ(x)/x)α (here ϕ(x) ∈ x + x2 C[[x]]).
Remark 1.1. In the previous paper we considered the action of operator Qe−x Q, taking
into account how the polynomials of binomial type change under its action on correspondα
pn (α + n), and
ing functions (we recall that the polynomials transform like pn (α) → α+n
so in particular case of the image of f inv (x) = x we end up with Abel polynomials [Abl]).
Then, according to the latter observations, the following relations are equivalent:

Observation 1.3 (conjugation x1/n ◦ (·) ◦ xn ): Note that for the formal power series
f (x) ∈ x + x2 C[[x]] the conjugation x1/n ◦ f (x) ◦ xn : f (x) → x(f (xn )/xn )1/n is well-defined.
For the simplicity we denote the result by f 1/n (xn ). Then the following holds:
T(f

1/n

(xn )) = (Tf )(xn ) · x1−n

Q(f

1/n

(xn )) = (Qf ) /n (xn ), and hence

TQ(f

1/n

(xn )) = (TQf )(xn ) · x1−n

1

(1.7)

Such an observation allows us to rewrite the property Tf (x) = 1p f (px) in terms of inverse
functions. Suppose pn = −n and the first coefficient of f is equal to A. Then the series of
f inv has the following form:
f inv (x) = x − Axn+1 +

(A(n + 1))2 x2n+1 (A(n + 1))3 (2 + 4n − 3n2 )x3n+1
+
+ ...
n+2
2(n + 2)(n2 − 3)
4

which in case n = 1 turns into ln(1 + 2Ax)/2A. For convenience we put A−1 = n(n + 1)
and rewrite it in the form:
−n ln((f inv )′ )(x /n ) = x −
1

x3 (17n − 29)
3x2
+
− ... ∈ x + x2 C[[x]]
2(n + 2) 6(n + 2)(n2 − 3)

Let us denote the resulting series by ϕn (x). Then for general constant A the following holds:
Z x 1
− ϕ (An(n+1)tn )
1/n inv
1/n
e n n
(fn (A x)/A ) =

(1.8)

Thus the property QTQ f inv (x) = 1p f inv (px) implies that
Z x 1

QTQ

And hence, according to (1.5), this property can be rewritten in the following form:
1
− n ϕn (xn )

TQ xe

= xe n

ϕn (−nxn )

or, taking (1.7) into account:
−ϕn (x)

TQ xe

1

= xe n

ϕn (−nx)

(1.9)

Note that this relation can be considered as a definition of the series ϕn (x) ∈ x + x2 C[[x]].
Remark 1.2. It should be noticed that the existense of such a series ϕn (x) does not
necessarily mean, that n must be a natural number. The condition n ∈ N is used only
when one wants, going in the opposite direction, to construct the meaningful series fn (x),
which consists of the powers xdn+1 . The equation for f can be rewritten in another form,
according to Observation 1.3, as follows: T f n (x1/n ) = xf (px1/n )/(px1/n ). That means
with the solution of equation T x exp(M q1 (x)) = x exp(M q1 (−px)/p) at our disposal, we
can construct the solution of equation TQ x exp(−M q2 (x)) = x exp(M q2 (−px)/p) (in this
case, however, q2 may not be the invertible series, being of the form xk + xk+1 C[[x]]). Let
us do it without using the trick with conjugation by the powers of x.
Proposition 1.5. Suppose for some σ, q ∈ x + x2 C[[x]], M, p ∈ C we have
M q(x)

T

−−−−→ xe

p −M σ(x)

x(1 − M xσ ′ (x)) e

−1

TQ

−−−−→ x(1 + M pxσ ′ (−px))

e

M
p σ(−px)

Proof : Obviously,
[(x exp(−M σ(x)))′ ]p = (1 − M xσ ′ (x))p exp(−M pσ(x))
In addition, from the assumption it follows that:
σ(x exp(M q(x))) = q(x)
q(x exp(−M σ(x))) = σ(x) and
x(1 + M xq ′ (x))−p = x exp(M q(−px))

Thus the existence of companion equation (1.9) for the series ϕn is the direct corollary
of this proposition. In particular, that means we can consider the general series ϕp ∈
x + x2 C[[x]], whenever the equation
−ϕp (x)

TQ xe

ϕp (−px)

has the solution for given p. At this point the only case ϕ1 (x) = ln(1 + x) is known. Let
us consider some other interesting cases.
The equation T2 f (x) =

f (2x)
2

As it was mentioned in the previous paper, the equation T2 f (x) = f (2x)/2 has two elementary solutions: sin x and tan x. In this paragraph we provide the general solution of
this equation.

Proof : By definition,
Θ′k (x)2 = (1 − Θ2k (x))(1 − k2 Θ2k (x)) ⇒ Θ′′k (x) = 2k2 Θ3k (x) − (k2 + 1)Θk (x)
Also, the Jacobi elliptic function obeys the addition theorem (see [Jac]):
Θk (x + y) =

Θk (x)Θ′k (y) + Θ′k (x)Θk (y)
1 − k2 Θ2k (x)Θ2k (y)

Hence

Corollary 1.1: ∀A ∈ C the series Θk (Ax)/A is also a solution of this equation.
Notice that we don’t really need to know the whole addition formula to prove this theorem,
the duplication formula only is required. Thus we can use another approach to prove this
theorem. Consider the chain, whose main properties were overviewed in the previous paper
(we use the notation ∆p = (epx − 1)/p, yp = ∆p e−x ):
T

yp −−−−→

which, obviously, goes on in the following way:
Z x

QTQ

That means the only thing required to prove the theorem is to notice, how the transformation T(∆−p /(1 − ∆−p )) = ∆p (1 − ∆−p ) looks like in terms of inverse series.
Remark 1.3. It should also be mentioned that the addition formula for the redefined

(note: this statement is nothing more than the brief reformulation of the following two
facts: if f (x) ≈ x + f1 x2 + ... + fk xk+1 , then the polynomials Am (f1 , ..., fm ) in expansion
Tf (x) ≈ x + A1 x2 + ... + Ak xk+1 indeed do not depend on the higher-order coefficients
fm+1 , fm+2 , ..., and that the polynomial Ak depends on fk linearly with coefficient −k, i.e.
Ak (f1 , ..., fk + q) = Ak (f1 , ..., fk ) − kq)
Proposition 1.7. Suppose T2 f (x) = f (2x)/2. Then f (x) = −f (−x).
Proof : Suppose such f (x) is nontrivial, i.e. there exists the least n > 1, such that the
coefficient α of xn+1 is not equal to zero. Then
f

n+1

= x + αxn+1 ⇒ (T2 f )

n+1

= x + n2 αxn+1

On the other hand, we have (T2 f )|n+1 = x + 2n αxn+1 . Hence 2n = n2 ⇒ n = 2 or n = 4.
Consider only the first case without loss of generality, i.e. f 3 = x + αx3 , where now α
can be equal to zero. Now if there exist some Ai and some q, such that
f

2n+2

= x + A1 x3 + A2 x5 + ... + An x2n+1 + qx2n+2

Then
(T2 f )

2n+2

= x + 22 A1 x3 + 24 A2 x5 + ... + 2n An x2n+1 + (2n + 1)2 qx2n+2

according to Proposition 1.6 and the fact that the coefficients Ai of odd powers x2n+1 can
not give contributions to the coefficient of even power x2n+2 under the action of T. But it
means that (2n + 1)2 q = 22n+1 q, and since the equation (2n + 1)2 = 22n+1 does not have
any integer solutions, we have q = 0. It means that all of the coefficients of even powers
in the expansion of f are equal to 0.
Proposition 1.8. Suppose f is the solution, which has the expansion f |5 = x+ αx3 + βx5 .
Suppose k, A is any pair of solutions of the system of equations −A2 (k2 + 1) = 3!α,
A4 (1 + 14k2 + k4 ) = 5!β. Then f (x) = Θk (Ax)/A.
Proof : One can easily derive the first few terms of Jacobi function from its definition and
obtain the expansion

That means it coincides with the expansion of f right up to the fifth term. Now suppose
q is the first deviation between the expansions of some term x2n+1 , i.e.

So either (2n)2 = 22n , or q = 0. But we have n > 2 due to the choice of k, A ⇒ (2n)2 6= 22n ,
hence q = 0.
That means the series Θk (Ax)/A are the only series of the form ∈ x + x2 C[[x]], satisfying
the equation T2 f = f (2x)/2.

And so the following identities are true:

Proof : According to Observation 1.7, if ϕp (x) has the expansion ϕp (x) = A1 (p)x +
+A2 (p)x2 + ..., and A1 (p) = 1, one can write down the following relation, comparing

k=2

m1 +...+mk =n
mi >0

That means, if p 6= −2, p2 6= 3, p3 6= −4, ..., then the condition A1 (p) = 1 determines the
sequence An (p). So, if Am (p) in case p → 0 converge to some value Am (0) for each m < n,
then An (p) converges too and
n

1 X δn,k − nk
An (0) =

k!
k=2

X

Am1 (0)...Amk (0)

m1 +...+mk =n
mi >0

(here, as usual δn,k = 1, if n = k, and 0 otherwise). Thus all An (0) are well-defined.
Similarly, we can rewrite this relation in the following form:
(n(−p)1−n − 1)An (p) =

n
X
(−p)1−k − nk (−p)1−n

k!

k=2

Then, since A1 (∞) is defined, we can conclude that An (∞) are well-defined too and are in
fact trivial: ∀n > 1 An (∞) = 0. Hence, limp→0 ϕp (x) = ϕ0 (x) and limp→∞ ϕp (x) = x in
the sense described above. Then it follows that the two other limits limp→0 ϕp (px)/p = x
and limp→∞ ϕp (px)/p exist, since the operator TQ is invertible. In case p = 0 we end up
with the equation

Remark 1.4. Then it follows from this proposition that the behaviour of free terms
and leading coefficients of numerators and denominators of rational functions An (p) is
relatively well understood.
General comment on section 1
Taking into account Remark 1.2, it is reasonable to consider the equation TQf (x) = 1p f (px).
It has the formal solutions whenever pn = n for some natural number n, to be more precise

TQ xe

for all n 6= 2, by the definition of ϕ−n , according to (1.7). In case p2 = 2 the solution takes
the form x + A1 x5 + A2 x9 + ..., i.e. it coincides with solution of the same equation in case
p4 = 4. It is interesting to know, if these series converge in some domain or they are purely
formal power series.
Since the chain yp → Typ → ∆p (1 − ∆−p ) provides the major part of known examples
of ϕn for different n, one can consider other chains of transformations QTQ for different
expressions, containing the functions γp = ypinv . An interested reader might find the main
examples in Appendix A.

Some properties of canonical continuations of polynomials
of binomial type

In this section we continue to study the formal series ps (α), which is the natural generalization of polynomials of binomial type pn (α). The main topic discussed here is about
the derivative ∂/∂s: its connection with alternative definition of logarithm, as an “integral”,
related to the “derivation” f (D), and how it allows to prove reflection formulae for ps (α)
in specific cases.
Here we use the following notation: the falling factorials x(x − 1)...(x − n + 1) are denoted
by (x)n ; an operator ∂/∂α is denoted by D for conciseness. Also we use the expression
f (x)
ps (α) or, alternatively, pfs (α) for f (x) ∈ x + x2 C[[x]] to denote the formal series
ps (α) ∈ αs + αs−1 C[[α−1 ]], which is determined by condition

ln α, defined by the condition Dαq ln α = αq−1 + qαq−1 ln α.

And that is indeed α lnf α.
Remark 2.3. It should be mentioned that from the relation f (D)ps (α) = sps−1 (α)
it follows that f (D)ṗs (α) = ps−1 (α) + sṗs−1 (α). Substituting s = 0, we obtain the
relation f (D)ṗ0 (α) = p−1 (α) = f ′ (D) · α−1 . Similarly, for s = 1, we end up with
the relation f (D)ṗ1 (α) = 1 + lnTf α, which is indeed true, since we have an identity
f (D)α = f ′ (D) + αf (D) for operators and the definition of lnf α.
There is one nice property, that the continuations of trivial polynomials for f (x) = x
ps (α) = αs have:
∂ αs ln α
= α−1
∂α αs
Such an indentity is trivial by itself, but it should be noticed that the numerator is
equal to the series ṗs (α), the denominator is equal to ps (α), and the RHS of this identity is
simply p−1 (α). There is no such an apparent structure in general, but in case of deformation
x → ∆p = (epx − 1)/p such a property is preserved with minor changes, which follows from
14

the properties of generalized harmonic numbers. But for the sake of correctness we need
to avoid the use of identity
∆p

ps (α) = p

s

Γ( αp + 1)
Γ( αp + 1 − s)

since we deal with the series, reflecting the asymptotic properties of Γ-function. In comparison, the series
Γ(− αp + s)
∗
s
ps (α) = (−p)
Γ(− αp )
from our formal point of view has the same properties, but represents completely different
class of functions, coinciding with the previous one only for integer values of s. Such a
confusion appears when we deal with functions, not the series, because the kernel of operator ∆p (D) is nontrivial and consists of all p-periodic functions. Although this distinction
does not affect our study, the caution is still required. That is how the inaccurate use of
the explicit formulae for general falling factorials ex − 1
(α)s for different functional
continuations leads to incoherent results with generalized harmonic numbers
∂
(α)s = (α)s (−γ + Hα−s )
∂s

∂
(α)s = (α)s (ln(−1) − γ + Hs−α−1 )

to make which agreeable one needs more than just fixing the meaningful value for logarithm
of negative unit. It is still necessary to notice the difference between bracketed expressions,
which in functional terms can be written as π cot(π(s − α)), the function that lies in the
kernel of eD − 1 because of its 1-periodicity. Consider the following statement, in which
we do not use the conventional functional notation on purpose.
We note only that the logarithm of any series of the form αs +αs−1 C[[α−1 ]] is well-defined
and is of the form s ln α + A1 α−1 + ... for the formal element ln α, as in general raising to
any power h is well-defined. Also it follows from the standard convolution identities that
eAD gh = (eAD g)h and, in particular, eAD ln g = ln(eAD g) for any g ∈ αs + αs−1 C[[α−1 ]].

epD ps+1 (α) = (α+p)ps (α). Then it follows that (epD −1)ps+1 (α) = (α+p)ps (α)−ps+1 (α).
On the other hand, by definition, (epD − 1)ps+1 (α) = p(s + 1)ps (α), hence ps+1 (α) =
= (α − ps)ps (α), as expected. Then

ps (α)p1−s (α) = ps (α)p1−s (α) is provided by the following theorem.

Theorem 2.2. Suppose f 6= g and pfs (α)pg1−s (α) = pgs (α)pf1−s (α). Then there exist
p, A, B, such that f (x) = ∆p (1 + A∆−p ), g(x) = ∆p (1 + B∆−p ), or, in other words, this
equation does not have any solutions other than those considered above.
The proof is divided in a few parts.
Proposition 2.5.
pfs (α)pg1−s (α) = pgs (α)pf1−s (α) ⇒ g(x) = f (x)(1 + AT−1 f (x))
for some constant A, or, equivalently g(x) = T2 eAx T−2 f (x).

Proof : Take the logarithmic derivative of LHS and RHS of this equation and set s = 0
(or, equivalently s = 1). According to Proposition 2.1, we have
ṗf0 − ṗg1 α−1 = ṗg0 − ṗf1 α−1 ⇐⇒ lnTf α − lng α = lnTg α − lnf α
Hence the following holds
xf ′ (x)

f (x)
g(x)
g(x)
f (x)
by definition of lnM α for any M (x). Now integrate this expression, after dividing by x:
C + ln(f (x) · T−1 f (x)) = ln(g(x) · T−1 g(x))
But f, g, T−1 f, T−1 g ∈ x + x2 C[[x]], and thus C = 0. Hence
f (x) · T−1 f (x) = g(x) · T−1 g(x)
By definition, f = T−1 f /(T−1 f )′ , so we can rewrite the expression above again
(T−1 f (x))′

(T−1 g(x))′

⇐⇒ −1
= A + −1
(T−1 g(x))2
(T−1 f (x))2
T g(x)
T f (x)
Hence T−2 g(x) = eAx T−2 f (x) or, equivalently, g(x) = f (x)(1 + AT−1 f (x))
Proposition 2.6.
pfs (α)pg1−s (α) = pgs (α)pf1−s (α) ⇒ f ′ (x) + g ′′ (0)f (x) = g ′ (x) + f ′′ (0)g(x)
Proof : Substituting the value s = 2 (or, equivalently s = −1) into the equation and using
the simple fact that pf2 (α) = α(α − f ′′ (0)), we obtain
α(α − f ′′ (0))pg−1 (α) = α(α − g′′ (0))pf−1 (α)
Taking into account the formulae pf−1 (α) = −αf (D) · α−1 and αg(D) = −g′ (D) + g(D)α,
we can rewrite the expression above in the following manner:
(−g′ (D) + g(D)(α − f ′′ (0)))

1
1
= (−f ′ (D) + f (D)(α − g′′ (0)))

Also f (D)1 = g(D)1 = 0, thus
(g′ (D) + f ′′ (0)g(D))

= (f ′ (D) + g′′ (0)f (D))
α
α

and hence f ′ (x) + g ′′ (0)f (x) = g ′ (x) + f ′′ (0)g(x)
Now we are ready to prove the theorem. Substituting g = f (1 + AT−1 f ), since (T−1 f )′ =
= (T−1 f )/f and g ′′ (0) = f ′′ (0) + 2A, one can easily obtain:
f ′ (x) + f (x)(f ′′ (0) + 2A) = [f (x)(1 + AT−1 f (x))]′ + f ′′ (0)f (x)(1 + AT−1 f (x)) ⇒
⇒ 2Af (x) = Af ′ (x)T−1 f (x) + AT−1 f (x) + Af ′′ (0)f (x)T−1 f (x)
The latter can be rewritten in the following form:
2A

1
T−1 f

(x) = A

f′
1
(x) + A (x) + Af ′′ (0)
f
f

18

Now, since we are interested in nontrivial solutions, we can divide both sides by A 6= 0 and
integrate. Then it follows that
f · T−1 f
′′
= e−f (0)x
−2
2
(T f )
But such an equation is equivalent to the following one:
(q ′ )2 − qq ′′ = ef

′′ (0)x

for q = T−2 f

Differentiating and rearranging the summands, we obtain:
q ′ (q ′′ − f ′′ (0)q ′ ) = q(q ′′′ − f ′′ (0)q ′′ )
Now if q ′′ − f ′′ (0)q ′ = 0, then q(x) = ∆f ′′ (0) (x). Otherwise, in case q ′′ − f ′′ (0)q ′ 6= 0, there
exists some constant C, such that
q′
q ′′′ − f ′′ (0)q ′′
= ′′
⇒ Cq(x) = q ′′ (x) − f ′′ (0)q ′ (x)
q
q − f ′′ (0)q ′
Then it follows that ∃c1 , c2 : q(x) = (ec1 x − 1)e−c2 x /c1 , and that includes the case q ′′ =
= f ′′ (0)q ′ . Hence f can be expressed as


1 − e−c1 x
ec1 x − 1
1 − c2
f (x) =

c1
Thus g can be expressed as
ec1 x − 1
g(x) =



1 − e−c1 x

and that proves the theorem.

General comment on section 2
The formula for ṗs /ps , successfully found in case yp
ps is not surprising, although it is not
obvious, if it has any natural generalization. In case f (x) = ex − 1
pn (α) there exists an
identity (αe−D )n = pn (α)e−nD for operators, and thus the operator (α f1′ (D))n = (αe−D )n
is proportional to the operator of multiplication by pn . Such a property is important,
because in this case the operator of division by pn (α) can be written down explicitly like
e−nD (αe−D )−n . Taking into account that for all s we have (αe−D )n ps (α) = ps+n (α), we
obtain that also (αe−D )−n ṗn (α) = ṗ0 (α) ⇒ ṗn (α)/pn (α) = ṗ0 (α−n). That is why we can
write down the expression for f (D)ṗn (α)/pn (α) in this case. On the other hand, in case
f = T2 yp there is no such apparent relation between the shift operator Anf := (α f1′ (D))n
and corresponding polynomials, but there is another equality of operators

On the basic properties of derivation and shift operators

In this section we study the main properties of operators αf ′ (D)−1 and f (D), which
we call shift and derivation respectively. The properties provided allow us to understand
the behaviour of polynomials pgn under the transformations T−1 f → f → Tf of associated
series more fully. In conclusion, we introduce two additional formulae for the sequence an ,
considered in the previous paper.
As usual we denote the falling factorials x(x − 1)...(x − n + 1) by (x)n . For conciseness,
the operators αf ′ (D)−1 and f (D) are sometimes denoted by Af and Df respectively.
Proposition 3.1. Consider some polynomial qn (α) of degree n, which has the coefficient
−1
of leading term equal to 1. Suppose T−1 f (x)
pTn f (α). Then the following holds:
−1 f

pTn

(α) =

1
(αf (D))n · qn (α)
n!

(3.1)

In particular,

1
(αf (D))n · pfn (α)
n!
Proof : The operators Af , Df clearly satisfy Df Af = 1 + Af Df . Then it folows from this
relation that Anf Dfn = (Af Df )n . To be precise: the latter obviously holds in case n = 1,
and if it holds for some k, from the simple corollary
−1 f

pTn

(α) =

Df Af = 1 + Af Df ⇒ Dfn Af = nDfn−1 + Af Dfn
it follows that
(Af Df )k+1 = (Af Df )k (Af Df − k) = Akf Dfk Af Df − kAkf Dfk =
k+1
= Akf (kDfk−1 + Af Dfk ) − kAkf Dfk = Ak+1
f Df

Hence, indeed AnT−1 f DTn−1 f = (αf (D))n . Acting with the latter operator on the polyno−1 f

mial qn (α), we obtain: (αf (D))n · qn (α) = AnT−1 f DTn−1 f · qn (α) = n!AnT−1 f · 1 = n!pTn
In particular, setting qn (α) =

pfn (α),

(α).

we obtain the remaining statement.
−1

The latter proposition shows the way to express polynomials pTn f (α), which does not
require the Lagrange inversion theorem and computation of the series of powers (T−1 f )−k .
We use this method below to provide some new formulae for the sequence an :

But for now consider a few more statements.

inv

Proposition 3.2. (formal). Suppose that the action of operator f ′ (D)−1 is well-defined
not only in case of the series ∈ αs C[[α−1 ]], but in more general case, as for polynomial
f ′ (x)−1 = P (x) or exponent f ′ (x)−1 = epx . Suppose f (x) has a simple zero ρ: f (ρ) = 0,
f ′ (ρ) 6= 0 and has an expansion f (x + ρ) ≈ f ′ (ρ)x + A1 x2 + ... at that point. Consider
the polynomials f (x + ρ)(f ′ (ρ))−1
pρs (α). Then if Af = αf ′ (D)−1 , the following formal
identity holds true:
pρn (α) = f ′ (ρ)n e−αρ Anf · eαρ
(3.2)
20

Proof : If the action of f ′ (D)−1 on exponent is well-defined, then the result must be of the
following canonical form: f ′ (D)−1 · eαt = f ′ (t)−1 eαt . Expanding the operator Anf in sum
Pn

Remark 3.1. Of course, the latter proposition makes sense only in special cases, for
example, if f (x) = ex − 1. In such “nice” cases the following equality of operators holds

Consider the function xeEi(x)−ln |x|−γ

Proof : Since T xeEi(x)−ln |x|−γ = xe−x , according to (3.1), for any polynomial qn (α) of
degree n with the coefficient of leading term equal to 1, we have n!νn (α) = (αDe−D )n qn (α).
Consider two cases: qn (α) = αn and qn (α) = (α)n . The main idea of this proof is to rewrite

General comment on section 3
Going back to Proposition 3.2, in which we considered the formal identity for the polynomials, associated to the expansion of the same function at other points, it should be
noticed that one can obtain more precise statement. For that purpose one can look at
more general structure of formal series αs eαt C[[α−1 ]] for some formal element t. Now one
can define the action of f (D) on exponent, considering f (x) as an element of more general
structure C[x, t]. Then we may consider the following expansion by the variable x with
formal power series of t as coefficients:

Now one can verify the following operator identities:
Df Asf = sAfs−1 + Asf Df ; Asf Ahf = Ahf Asf = Afs+h
and the evaluation
Asf · eαt = f ′ (t)−s pts (α)eαt
where pts (α) for t = 0 are equal to the ordinary canonical continuations of polynomials,
and in general are naturally given by definition

In particular, such an approach allows us to define the operator ln Af , for which the
following holds:
ln Af · ps (α) = ṗs (α)
With regard to Theorem 3.1, one may derive, actually, more general statement from Proposition 3.1, which can be used as an alternative to the Lagrange inversion theorem, precisely:

It is left to notice that in addition to ψ(x) = QT−1 xe−x , we have ψ(x) = x ∂x

Conclusion
The main goal of this study was to investigate the equation f /f ′ = f (px)/p. The fact, that
solutions of this equation in case p4 = ±4 are actually known, came as a surprise to me,
but now, when the answer to this question is known, it doesn’t seem really that surprising.
Unfortunately, we are far from full understanding of the structure of this equation, but
it is hoped, that one can say something else about the resulting series apart from their
coefficients.

Appendix B

Theorem. Consider f (x) = ∆p (1 + A∆−p ). Suppose Af = αf ′ (D)−1 , Df = f (D).
Then if we denote the falling factorials by (x)n , for any integral n the following holds:


n+1 ′
2n+1 n
2n+1 α
+n
Af f (D)
Af = p
p
2n+1
Proof : It is sufficient to prove the statement for any p 6= 0, since the case p = 0 is
the degeneration of general one. Expand the brackets and put τ = A/p. Then f ′ (x) =
= (1 + τ )epx − τ e−px , and hence (f ′ (D))2 = 1 + 2p(1 + 2τ )Df + p2 Df2 , f ′′ = p2 f + p(1 + 2τ ).
−1
It is sufficient to show that if gn = An+1
f ′ (D)2n+1 Anf , then gn gn−1
= α2 − n2 p2 , since
f
g0 = α.

f + Af

Now use the equality of operators Df Anf = nAfn−1 + Anf Df , to rewrite the latter expression
in the following manner:
(1 + 2τ )(1 + 2n)pAf − n(2n + 1)p2 + p2 (2n + 1)Af Df + A2f −

− 2np(1 + 2τ )Af + 2p(1 + 2τ )A2f Df + n(n + 1)p2 − 2np2 Af Df +

+ p2 A2f Df2 =

= −n2 p2 + A2f + p2 Af Df + p(1 + 2τ )Af + 2p(1 + 2τ )A2f Df + p2 A2f Df2 =
= −n2 p2 + p2 Af Df + p(1 + 2τ )Af + A2f f ′ (D)2

It is left to notice the explicit formula
A2f = α2
