ABSTRACT

Blueshifted absorption lines are seen in high inclination black hole binary systems in
their disc dominated states, showing these power an equatorial disc wind. While some
contribution from magnetic winds remain a possibility, thermal and thermal-radiative
winds are expected to be present. We show results from radiation hydrodynamic simulations which show that the additional radiation force from atomic features (bound-free
and lines) are important along with electron scattering. Together, these increase the
wind velocity at high inclinations, so that they quantitatively match the observations
in H 1743-322, unlike purely thermal winds which are too slow. We highlight the role
played by shadowing of the outer disc from the (sub grid) inner disc Compton heated
layer, and show that the increase in shadow from the higher Compton temperature
after the spectral transition to the hard state leads to strong suppression of the wind.
Thermal-radiative winds explain all of the spectral features (and their disappearance)
in this simplest wind system and magnetic winds play only a minor role. We speculate that thermal-radiative winds can explain all the spectral features seen in the
more complex (larger disc size) binaries, GRO J1655-40 and GRS 1915+105, without
requiring magnetic winds.

INTRODUCTION

Outflowing gas is ubiquitous in accreting systems across
mass scale from protostars (e.g.Bachiller 1996; CarrascoGonzález et al. 2010) through to both stellar mass compact
objects in X-ray binaries (e.g. Remillard & McClintock 2006;
Dı́az Trigo & Boirin 2016) and supermassive black holes in
active galactic nuclei (AGN) at the centre of galaxies (e.g.
Heckman et al. 1990; Hagino et al. 2016). These outflows,
as either highly collimated jets (e.g. Burrows et al. 1996;
Mirabel & Rodrı́guez 1999; Remillard & McClintock 2006)
or wider angle winds (e.g. Tombesi et al. 2010; Ueda et al.
2009), can have a large mass and/or kinetic power so they
can have a significant impact on the accretion environment.
The important open questions in the field are how these outflows are driven, whether there are common processes across

these very different objects, and whether there is a causal
relation between jets and disc winds. Here we address these
questions in the specific setting of the Galactic Compact
objects.
Low-mass X-ray binary systems, both neutron star binaries (NSBs) and black holes binaries (BHBs) can show
blueshifted absorption lines from highly ionised ions. These
winds are fairly slow, typically less than 1000 km/s (Miller
et al. 2015), seen preferentially in high inclination systems
(e.g. the compilation by Ponti et al. 2012) where the binary
separation is large (e.g. Dı́az Trigo & Boirin 2016).These features indicate an equatorial disc wind launched from large
radii, where the latter is indicated both by the wind preference for large systems and its slow velocity. The final observational constraint is that the winds are seen only when
the spectra are soft and fairly luminous, in disc dominated
states, rather than in the Compton dominated hard state
(Ponti et al. 2012; Ponti et al. 2014). The spectral change
can be explained as a transition between a disc and hot ac-

cretion flow, where the collapse of the larger scale height hot
flow into a geometrically thin disc also triggers the collapse
of the steady compact radio jet (see e.g. the review by Done
et al. 2007). This association of the onset of the wind with
the suppression of the jet was first noted in GRS 1915+105
by Neilsen & Lee (2009), who suggested that the same magnetic field responsible for the jet in the hard state underwent
a reconfiguration to power a wind by Lorentz force (magnetic
wind) in the soft state. This is consistent with the general
disappearance of the wind in the hard states (see e.g. Ponti
et al. 2012), though not with the simultaneous observation
of jets and winds in more complex intermediate states (e.g.
Kalemci et al. 2016; Homan et al. 2016), nor does it explain
the preference of winds for systems with larger discs. Also,
the current magnetic wind models (Fukumura et al. 2010) require a special configuration of the large scale magnetic fields
threading accretion disc, but the existence of such magnetic
fields is unknown.
Instead, thermal winds have a clear link to both disc size
and illuminating spectrum and luminosity. The pioneering
work by Begelman et al. (1983, hereafter B83) showed that
bright X-ray emission from the inner disc and corona heats
the surface of the disc at larger radii to the Compton temperature, TIC . This temperature depends only on the spectrum
of the radiation, so the entire disc surface has a heated atmosphere at this temperature, which is unbound at radii RIC
where this temperature means that particles have enough
energy to escape i.e.kTIC = GMc µm p /RIC where where µ is
the mean molecular weight, set to 0.61. This launches a thermal wind at radii larger than the inverse Compton radius,
RIC ∼ (6.4 × 104 /TIC,8 ) Rg (Rg = GMc /c2, TIC,8 = TIC /108 K),
giving a clear dependence on both the spectrum (through
TIC ) and the disc size, as observed.
However, such thermal wind solutions were disfavoured
due to a single, highly anomalous, wind from GRO J1655-40,
where the wind launch radius could be inferred from density
diagnostics. The observed ionisation state was unusually low
for these winds, at ξ = L/nR2 ∼ 100, while the density measured from metastable levels was quite high. The observed
luminosity was fairly low, so the derived launch radius was
much smaller than RIC , ruling out a thermal wind (Miller
et al. 2006a; Kallman et al. 2009; Luketic et al. 2010; Neilsen
& Homan 2012; Higginbottom & Proga 2015). However, the
unusual properties of the broad-band continuum seen during
this observation indicate that the intrinsic source luminosity
may be substantially underestimated, with the wind being so
strong that it has become optically thick (Done et al. 2007;
Uttley & Klein-Wolt 2015; Neilsen et al. 2016; Shidatsu et al.
2016).
Done et al. (2018, hereafter D18) revisited the thermal
wind models of B83, combining their analytic equations for
the mass loss rate with the hydrodynamic results of Woods
et al. (1996) to predict the wind observables of column density, ionisation state and velocity as a function of spectral
shape, luminosity and inclination. They stressed that the
observed winds are generally seen at fairly high L/LEdd , and
suggested that radiation force could play an important role,
so that the winds are more accurately described as thermalradiative rather than simply thermal.
Here we show the first hydrodynamic simulations of
thermal-radiative winds with realistic illuminating spectra
and full opacities. We tailor these simulations for the typ-

ical BHB system H 1743-322, where Chandra grating data
clearly detect the wind during a soft state, but show only
tight upper limits on similar absorption features during a
hard state. We show that the wind velocity in the soft state
is much faster than predicted by purely thermal winds (see
also Luketic et al. 2010; Higginbottom & Proga 2015), but
that the radiation force from the combination of electron
scattering and atomic opacities (both edges and lines) produces additional driving which increases the wind velocity
at high inclinations, matching well to that observed. We
show that the strong suppression of the wind when the system switches to the hard state is predicted by the thermalradiative wind models as claimed in D18, but for a rather
different reason, more connected to radiation transfer effects
in the inner disc atmosphere than to the different outer
disc wind properties. These simulations demonstrate that
thermal-radiative winds are the origin of most (perhaps all)
of the outflows seen in Galactic compact binaries.

THE BHB H 1743-322

There are currently four BHBs which show wind features
in their soft states, namely GRO J1655-40, GRS 1915+105,
H 1743-322 and 4U 1630-472 (see e.g. the compilation of
Ponti et al. 2012). The anomalous features of the wind in one
observation of GRO J1655-40 are discussed above (though
see Higginbottom et al. 2018) for a thermal wind simulation of a more normal soft state. GRS 1915+105 has a mean
luminosity around Eddington, so radiation force will be extremely important. It also typically shows complex spectra
rather than standard soft or hard states, and has a truly
enormous disc so needs a very large simulation domain. The
system parameters for 4U 1630-472 are not well known and
it has a very large galactic column which makes determining
the soft state disc luminosity difficult.
This leaves H 1743-322 as the best object to model in
detail. This object has recurrent transient outbursts, switching from hard to soft on the fast rise, and soft to hard
on the slower decline. Chandra High Energy Transmission
Grating (HETG) observations during a standard disc dominated state in 2003 show blueshifted absorption lines from
Fe XXV and Fe XXVI (ObsID:3803, see Miller et al. 2006b),
with only upper limits on these absorption lines in the hard
state in 2010 (ObsID:11048, see Miller et al. 2012). We reanalyse the data of soft state, and fit with Gaussian absorption line (gabs in xspec) to get columns and velocity. We find these values are within ±1σ errors of those of
previously reported i.e the column and velocity of Fe XXV,
NXXV = 8.2+1.2
× 1016 cm−2 and VXXV = 370 ± 120 cm−2 ,
−1.1
while those of Fe XXVI are NXXVI = 4.0 ± 0.3 × 1017 cm−2 and
VXXVI = 630+80
km/s.
−120
We adopt system values from Shidatsu & Done (2019),
where M = 7M , D = 8.5 kpc, and inclination of 75 ± 3◦
(Steiner et al. 2012). We note that these are different to
those assumed in D18, so that the observed bolometric luminosities from the RXTE PCA data for the soft and hard
state correspond to L/LEdd = 0.3, and 0.06 (compare to 0.1
and 0.02 in D18).
The remaining key parameter which determines the
strength of a thermal wind is the disc size, Rdisc . This is
quite poorly known. D18 assume Rdisc = 5RIC to connect

The thermal-radiative wind in H 1743-322
to the hydrodynamic simulations of Woods et al. (1996) but
Shidatsu & Done (2019) note that the outburst frequency
puts the source on the edge of the disc instability, similarly
to GX339-4. We use the MAXI lightcurve to measure the
mean X-ray luminosity over a 10-year time span. The mean
MAXI 2-20 keV count rate is about 10 times lower than the
count rate seen during the low/hard state (L/LEdd = 0.06)
used by Shidatsu & Done (2019), This converts to a mean
mass transfer rate of ∼ 6 × 1016 g s−1 , where the disk instability condition predicts an orbital period of ∼ 7 hours (Coriat et al. 2012). Assuming the companion star has a similar
mass ratio as in GX339-4 then this implies a Roche lobe
size of 1.7 × 1011 cm, and hence a disc radius of 1.2 × 1011 cm
(70% Roche lobe size), which is 0.2 RIC . This is the point at
which thermal winds are launched, so the wind will depend
quite sensitively on size scale here. Given the uncertainties,
we start first by calculating the wind produced by a disc
with Rdisc = RIC , and then explore the effect of changing
parameters.

COMPUTATIONAL METHOD
Code Overview

Our radiation-hydrodynamic simulation code was developed
by Takahashi & Ohsuga (2013), described most recently in
Nomura et al. (2016). This is similar to the code used in
earlier work by Proga et al. (2000); Proga & Kallman (2004).
We solve the standard equations of motion in spherical polar
coordinates, including the radiation force on the material,
together with the continuity equations for mass and energy
equation, where the latter includes a net heating/cooling
term for the material, L. This is defined by


ρ 2
ρL =
[Γ(ξ, T) − Λ(ξ, T)]
(1)
µm p
where mass density and number density are related byρ =
nµm p . The heating, Γ, and cooling, Λ, rates per unit volume
are calculated by cloudy (Ferland 2003), although the simple heating and cooling functions are employed in Nomura
et al. (2016). These depend on the shape of the illuminating spectrum, which is discussed in more detail in the next
section, as well as on the temperature T and ionisation parameter

where Fx is the X-ray flux and L x is the X-ray luminosity
at each grid point. These are defined from the intrinsic luminosity, Lx0 , which is modified for absorption/scattering
along the line of sight so that L x = Lx0 e−τ(R,θ) . We assume
that the corona and inner disc are both effectively a central
point source, so that
Õ
τ(R, θ) =
M(ξ, T)κes ρ(R, θ)δR + τ0 (θ)
(3)
where κes = 0.34 cm2 g−1 is the mass-scattering coefficient for
free electrons, τ0 is optical depth of inner corona discribed in
Sec.3.3 and M(ξ, T) is the force multiplier defined by Tarter
& McKee (1973). This force is calculated by cloudy and
accounts for the additional opacity from continuum process
(bound-free; photoelectric absorption edges) and line process

(bound-bound transitions) (Fig.2b), but does not include
the additional force from velocity shifts as the velocity is
low. This also defines the radiation force on the material as

fractions of Fe XXV and Fe XXVI, fXXV (ξ, T) and fXXVI (ξ, T)
at each point of ξ and T.

In the simulation grid, we set angle of disk from mid-plane
αd (R) = arctan{Hd (R)/R − Hd (Rin )/Rin } in order to set αd =
0 (θ = π/2) at inner radius of computational domain Rin (see
also, Appendix.A).
We apply the axially symmetric boundary at the rotational axis of the accretion disk, θ = 0 so that ρ, p and
vr are symmetric, while vθ and vφ are antisymmetric). We
apply a reflecting boundary at θ = π/2 so that ρ, p, vr and
vφ are symmetric, but vθ is antisymmetric. Outflow boundary conditions are employed at the inner and outer radial
boundaries, so that matter can freely leave but not enter
the computational domain. We set our radial computational
grid from R = (0.01 − 1)Rout , with 120 values logarithmically
spaced. Our assumed value of Rout = 6.6 × 105 Rg is coincidentally equal to RIC for the Compton temperature of the
soft state SED of 1.0 × 107 K.
We set a specific polar angle grid to follow the shape
of the disc surface, so we take 120 values of θ to cover the
disc/atmosphere transition for angles θ > π/2− αd (Rout ) and
another 120 values to cover the wind region with constant
solid angle d(cos θ) = sin θdθ. In p
the disc zone and disk surface, we set v R = 0, vφ = vk = GMc /R sin θ at each time
step.
We initially set temperature T(R, θ) = 1.1 ×
107 (R/6Rg )−3/4 K, density ρ0 (R, θ) = 1.0 × 10−33 g cm−3 (exp
cept in the disk region), v R (R, θ) = 0, vθ (R, θ) = GM/R sin θ
and vφ (R, θ) = 0.
For comparison with observation, we calculate the ion
density of Fe XXVI and Fe XXV from simulations via nXXVI =
n AFe fXXVI (ξ, T) and nXXV = n AFe fXXVI (ξ, T), where
AFe = 3.3×10−5 is iron abundance relative to hydrogen which
is the same value as Miller et al. (2006b). We use these to
define the ion column density along any line of sight, and
to calculate the column density weighted mean velocity for
each ion.

3.2

Ionisation state calculations

We focus first on the soft state, where the absorption lines
are detected, and show the SED from quasi-simultaneous
RXTE PCA data (ObsIDs P95368-01-01-00) in Fig. 1a. We
use this to calculate the heating and cooling rates from
cloudy, assuming that the illuminated gas is optically thin.
Fig.1b shows the heating and cooling rates for material
at a given temperature and pressure ionisation parameter

The vertical dashed line shows ξH,min = 1.7 × 102 which is the
ionisation parameter of disc surface.

Ξ = Prad /Pgas = L/(4πR2 cnkT) = (ξ/T) × 1/(4πck) where ξ is
the standard ionisation parameter defined above. Thermal
equilibrium is produced when the heating rate per unit volume is equal to its cooling rate, as indicated by the heavy
black line in Fig.1b. The blue region to the left of this curve
shows that the cooling rates are larger than the heating
rates, whereas the opposite orange region shows that the
heating rates are larger rate than cooling rates. The solutions with positive slope, i.e, dT/dΞ > 0 are thermally stable
because if the temperature rises slightly from this curve fixing Ξ, the cooling rates are larger than the heating rates and
the temperature goes down. For the opposite reason, those
with negative slope are thermally unstable. The changing
points of the sign of slope are instability points.
This thermal equilibrium curve has a very complex
shape, with four stable branches separated by regions of instability and/or rapid change (Fig.1b, with zoom in Fig.1c).
This is very different to the single S shaped thermal equilibrium curve using in B83, where there is a minimum pressure
ionisation parameter associated with the material on the
hot branch, Ξh,min at the temperature ∼ 12 TIC which marks
the bottom of the heated atmosphere, while the maximum
pressure ionisation parameter associated with material on

the cold branch Ξc,min , marks the top of the disc. Instead,
for this more complex shape, we take the minimum pressure ionisation parameter of the long middle branch (associated with partially ionised Oxygen and Iron L shell) to
mark the bottom of the heated atmosphere at i.e. we set
ΞH,min = Ξm,min = 8.2, where T  TIC .
Fig.2a shows this equilibrium curve in the standard ionisation parameter representation. The Ξm,min point corresponds to material with ξ = 170, where the soft X-ray opacity is already substantial. The maximum pressure ionisation parameter on the cold branch, Ξc,max ∼ 7.4 has standard ξ ∼ 14 (see Fig.2a), so it is underneath layers with
14 ≤ ξ ≤ 170. This material has very substantial opacity so
it seems very unlikely that it can be irradiated directly by
the source SED. Hence we assume the disc surface also has
Ξm,min i.e. we set ΞC,max = Ξm,min . These are almost identical
in Ξ (see Fig.1c), but quite different in ξ due to their very
different temperatures. We use thermal equilibrium to set
density at the disc surface to ξ = 170. At each time step,
the density of disc surface is update via n = L x /(170R2 ) and
check that temperature is hotter than that of the viscous
heated disc across the entire grid.

3.3

Inner attenuating corona

The original thermal wind paper of B83 gives an overview
of the structure of the Compton heated upper layers of the
disc for optically thin material. In this limit, the heated
material above the inner disc forms a static atmosphere
with scale height Hc /R ∼ (vIC /vg ) = (TIC /Tg )1/2 where vg
(Tg ) is the escape velocity (virial temperature). This gives
Hc ∼ [2R3 /RIC ]1/2 . However, Begelman & McKee (1983,
hereafter BM83) shows that it is easy for this heated atmosphere to go optically thick in the radial direction along the
disc plane, so it forms an inner attenuation zone, reaching

This gives Ris = 0.18RIC for L/LEdd = 0.3 for our assumed system parameters with the soft state SED. We incorporate the sub-grid physics of this inner attenuating corona
by changing the illumination pattern onto the disc in the
outer regions which are covered by the hydrodynamic grid.
We define a critical angle from the mid-plane αc = Hc /Ria
and assume that the optical depth from the centre to any
point on the disc surface has τ = exp[1−(α/αc )2 ] and use this
to attenuate the X-ray luminosity by e−τ before it enters the
grid.

RESULTS FOR FIDUCIAL SOFT STATE
SPECTRAL ENERGY DISTRIBUTION

We run a series of simulations as described below, with
parameters and resulting mass loss rates given in Tab.1.
All simulations run for 9 sounds crossing time (cIC /RIC =
p
kTIC /(µm p )/RIC ). This correspons to 1.7 × 105 s.

mean Vr [km/s]

For our soft state simulation this gives Ria ∼ 0.0004RIC ∼
200Rg . This radius is on scales which are more than an order
of magnitude smaller than the starting point of our radial
grid, so this structure cannot be resolved by our simulation.
However, it strongly affects the wind properties in the simulation range as it casts a shadow over the disc surface out to
large radii (see Fig.3). The outer disc is only directly irradiated again when the disc scale height increases by a large
enough factor that it rises above the shadow zone. For an
irradiated disc with scale height given by equation 4, then
the shadow cast by the inner attenuation zone ends at Ris ,
where the disc is directly illuminated again. The geometry
gives Hd /Ris = Hc /Ria so that

Fiducial Simulation: effect of radiation force

We first run a fiducial simulation, for the soft state SED in
Fig.1, assuming L/LEdd = 0.3. We include all radiation force
terms (electron scattering, bound-free and line), attenuation
of these effects and fiducial inner corona defined by Eq.3.
The derived density and temperature structure are shown
in the Appendix (top left in Fig.B1) and the total mass loss
rate through the outer boundary is 21 × 1018 g s−1 (see Table
1). The black lines in Fig.4 show the column density (upper
panel) and velocity (lower panel) as a function of inclination

angle for this simulation, with Fe XXVI as the solid line and
Fe XXV as dashed.
We compare this to the results from a simulation where
we turn off all the radiation force terms and their attenuation
except inner corona (M = 0 in Eq.3), so that the wind only is
thermally driven (top middle in Fig. B1 and red lines in Fig.
4). This simulation has much lower total mass loss rate, of
8.7×1018 g s−1 , so it is clear that radiation force is important,
and that this wind is better described as thermal-radiative
rather than simply thermal. The thermal wind has a very
low velocity at high inclination angles, close to the equatorial
plane of the disc, so it has very large column density in these
directions. Neither of these matches well to the observations
at the inferred high inclination angle of H 1743-322 (shown
by the cyan points).
Including the full radiation force terms gives a dramatic
increase in velocity at large inclination angles. This is be-

cause this material close to the disc is mainly on the middle
branch of the thermal equilibrium curve i.e. is at an ionisation parameter close to ξ ∼ 170, with the corresponding
temperature which is substantially less than the Compton
temperature, so the material forms a mainly static atmosphere rather than an outflowing corona (Higginbottom &
Proga 2015; Higginbottom et al. 2018). The presence of the
middle branch of the S curve for this soft continuum spectrum gives the difference between these calculations and the
earlier exploration of Proga & Kallman (2002), where they
showed that the radiative force was negligible for a much
harder continuum.

Instead, when radiation force is included, this warm,
partially ionised material has enough opacity for bound-free
and bound-bound opacity to accelerate it out so it can escape
as a wind. This increases in velocity more than offsets the
increased amount of material which escapes, so the column
density decreases.

We investigate which term of the radiation force is most
important at any ξ. Fig.2b shows force multiplier of the continuum process (red), lines process (green) and their sum
(black) at thermal equilibrium state. Radiation force on free
elections may have some impact on the simulations, but at
our luminosity of only 0.3LEdd , this alone is not enough to
unbind much material. We run an additional simulation including only this term, and find a total mass loss rate of
8 × 1018 g s−1 , so same within 10%. than the purely thermal wind. Fig.2b shows that the radiation force on lines
and photo-electric opacities have similar magnitudes, and
that adding all the terms together gives a force multiplier
of around M = 9.6 at ξ = 170, thus the ratio of total radiation force to gravity is M × L/LEdd = 0.3 × 9.6 > 1. Neglecting
line opacity but including electron scattering and bound-free
gives a force multiplier of 3.6, so this is just enough to get to
unbind the material when it is launched, but not enough to
continue accelerating it once it becomes more ionised. We
rerun a simulation including only electron scattering and
bound-free opacities and find a mass loss rate of 9.8 × 1018
g s−1 . Thus it is the combination of all opacity sources which
is important at high but subcritical L/LEdd values, and a single correction factor for L/LEdd (as in D18) is too simplistic
to describe the behaviour revealed

nosity and disc size depend on the assumed system parameters which are poorly known. The analytic models give a
dependence on NH ∝ log Rdisc /Rin where Rin = 0.2RIC is the
launch radius of the wind. However, the reduction in column
required from the data is not simple to produce in the analytic approximation of D18 as Fe XXVI should decrease by
factor 5 but that of Fe XXV should decrease by 2 orders magnitude at 75◦ . However, we note that our disc size is already
only Rdisc = RIC , and the analytic approximations probably
become unreliable as we approach the wind launch radius.
Instead, we reduce the disc size to Rdisc = 0.18Rout ,
which is the same radius as inner shadow radius as well as
the wind launch radius, then we re-run the simulation including full radiation force. We run the simulation over the
same grid as before, but set a very low density at mid-plain
(θ = 90◦ ) when the radius is larger than the disc radius. The
blue line in Fig. 5 shows the results of this simulation. We
can reproduce the ion columns seen in the data, and in particular we now have a higher column of Fe XXVI than Fe XXV,
indicating a higher ionisation state for the wind. The wind
is launched, but only just! The mass loss rate is 20 times
smaller than that of fiducial simulation, so the density of
the wind is quite low. It is still slightly overshadowed, so the
disc is not fully illuminated by the central source, but the
drop in overall mass accretion rate reduces the density sufficiently for the ionisation parameter to be higher than before.
This means that the contribution of line and photo-electric
absorption to the driving is almost negligible. This wind is
driven by the combination of radiation force on electrons and
gas pressure gradient force, and its velocity matches well to
that measured in the data.
We explore the effect of some of the other parameters
input into the fiducial simulation below in order to illustrate
their impact on the predicted wind, but this is our best
match overall to the observed data.

Changing luminosity:L/LEdd = 0.5 and 0.1

Figure 6. As Fig.4 but for L = 0.5LLdd .

We now consider the effect of changing luminosity. We run
an additional set of simulations with L/LEdd = 0.5 for the
same SED. This changes the radius of inner attenuation zone
and the outer disc scale height, so that the shadow extends
to Ris = 0.22Rout . Fig. 6 shows the resultant column density
(upper) and velocity (lower) for this simulation including all
radiation forces (green) compared to a purely thermal wind
at the same luminosity (yellow). The purely thermal results
are very similar to those at L/LEdd = 0.3, with very low
velocity at high inclination angles, and consequently large
column density. This material is again mainly on the middle
branch of the ionisation instability, so it does not have high
enough temperature to escape. However, including radiation
force on this material makes even more difference at these
higher luminosities, so the column is lower and the velocity
higher than for L/LEdd = 0.3, bringing the models closer to
the observed data points (cyan).
We also run a simulation including all radiation force
terms with the same SED but L/LEdd = 0.1. Fig.7 shows
the column and velocity from this (violet) compared to
L/LEdd = 0.3 (black) and 0.5 (green) including all radiation
force terms. The column densities in each ion are remarkably
similar, but the velocity increases dramatically at high in-

clination angles, and the total mass loss rate increases from
1.8 to 21 to 28 × 1018 g s−1 .
Fig.7 clearly shows that thermal-radiative winds are fast
enough to match the observations for L/LEdd & 0.3, but
that these luminosities give columns which are a factor 3–10
larger than observed. There are multiple ways we can reduce
the wind efficiency. As we already indicated in Sec.4.2, the
first is by reducing the size or height of the outer disc (the
system parameters are quite uncertain, and the disc scale
height need not exactly follow the irradiated disc shape (see
e.g. Kimura & Done 2019), the second is by changing the irradiation pattern as a function of angle. Section 3.3 assumed
a very simple exponential attenuation with angle produced
by the inner corona. Density structure in the inner corona
could give slightly stronger attenuation of both the disc and
X-ray source at large inclination angles, or the different radiation pattern of the flat disc and more isotropic X-ray source
could give different spectral illumination of the disc surface
compared to that observed.

Changing the extent of the shadow from the
inner attenuation zone

We quantify the ideas above by simply reduce the illumination of the outer disc by changing the shadow size to
Ris /RIC = 1.0 on each of the simulations for L/LEdd = 0.3
and 0.5, including full radiation force.
The lines in black and orange on Fig. 8 shows the effect
of this for L/LEdd = 0.3, while the lines in green and magenta
show this for L/LEdd = 0.5. The extended shadow means
that the illuminating flux is lower for the given simulation,
which means that the wind mass loss rate is lower (D18).
However, the velocity remains mainly unchanged, as once
the wind rises up it sees the same radiation force as before.
Hence this makes the column lower, whilst maintaining the
fast velocity, giving a better match to the data (cyan).
A changing radiation pattern from the flat disc and
more isotropic X-ray source would have a similar effect in
reducing the illumination of the disc surface, but keeping
the full radiation force on the wind once it rises up, though

RESULT FOR THE HARD STATE
SPECTRAL ENERGY DISTRIBUTION

We now consider the predicted wind properties in the hard
spectral state. The yellow line in Fig. 9a shows the observed
SED after the switch to the hard state. This has a much
higher Compton temperature than the soft state (black),
and the thermal equilibrium curve is now closer to the classic S curve of B83. The luminosity is fairly low, but the
high Compton temperature means that the thermal wind
can be launched from closer to the black hole than in the
soft state, so it can be more highly ionised (see D18). However, the key new aspect in this work is the realisation that
the inner attenuation zone also responds to the changing
SED. The higher Compton temperature means that this has

higher scale height, so it now casts a deep shadow over the
entire outer disc, with Ris = 11Rout . This completely suppresses the thermal wind unless the hard X-ray source has
scale height which is larger than the inner attenuation zone
Hc ∼ 20Rg . The response of the wind to the changing SED is
not then simply due to the wind being launched from closer
in, and being more highly ionised, as suggested by D18. Instead, here there is no thermal wind since the outer disc is
not irradiated. The inner attenuation zone responds to the
changing SED, increasing in scale height and hence increasing the shadow cast over the disc.
We run a final simulation for this hard state to confirm
that the wind is suppressed sufficiently to match with the
observational data. We use the hard state spectrum to calculate a new set of heating and cooling rates. These define
the disc surface at Ξc,max = 12, Tc,max = 3.5 × 104 K which
gives the ξc,max = 22 from thermal equilibrium curve (blue
line in Fig.9b). Thus, we set the density at the disc surface
as n = L x /(22R2 ) at each time step and the grid size is same
as Sec.4. We include the illumination attenuation from the
inner corona but do not include line force as this is entirely
negligible for highly ionised, very optically thin material.
Fig. 10 shows that the predicted iron columns are more
than a factor 10 lower than the observational upper limits
(the density and temperature structure are Fig. B3), so our
thermal wind simulation can indeed explain the disappearance of the wind in the hard state. This is because of over
ionisation by the hard X-ray and large size of inner corona.
In the hard state, when the thermal instability once occurs,
the temperature rapidly heats up to the Compton temperature TIC = 7.0 × 107 K (Fig. B3). This rapid rise gives strong
gas pressure gradient force, so velocity is lager than that of
soft state (Fig.10b). The large velocity lead the low density
if we consider mass continuity, also the large inner corona
suppress the wind density.
However, there is still a wind, and the mass loss rate is
over half of the mass accretion rate. We can understand this
result by using the analytic estimates in D18. These show
that the critical luminosity, where the Compton heating is
sufficient to produce a wind from RIC , is Lcrit ∼ 0.04. This
is below the observed luminosity of Lbol = 0.06 LEdd , but
the attenuation by the inner corona means that the flux
illuminating the inner edge of the hydrodynamic grid is a
factor 10 lower. Thus L/Lcrit ∼ 0.1, but the disc is large
compared to RIC (Rout /RIC = 7.0), so the wind is still quite
effective (see cyan line in Fig 3 of D18). Thermal winds have
a large impact on the mass available for the outburst for
systems with a large disc, explored in more detail in Dubus
et al (2019, in prep).

DISCUSSION

We have shown results from the first radiation hydrodynamic simulations of a thermal-radiative wind. Including the
radiation force gives important differences to the structure of
the thermal wind for L > 0.1LEdd (Sec.4.1 ,4.3). We include
electron scattering, bound-free absorption and line opacity
as these all give corrections which are of similar order, and
all of them together act to produce a force multiplier which is
large enough for these sub-Eddington flows to become superEddington. Thermal winds alone are too slow to match to

10

the observed winds (see also Higginbottom et al. 2018), but
these thermal-radiative winds can produce both the column
density and velocity of the material seen in the soft state of
H1743-322.
We identify the key role played by the inner static
corona, on size scales of a few hundred Rg (Sec.4.4, ). This
material is part of the Compton heated atmosphere of the
disc, but is on size scales much less than RIC so it is bound,
and has H  R. Nonetheless, it is important in determining
the illumination of the outer disc where the wind arises. It
is very easy for this corona to become optically thick in the
equatorial plane, so that it shadows much of the outer disc
from the inner disc emission. This material is below our grid
scale, so we incorporate it analytically following BM83. The
scale height of the inner corona casts a shadow which prevents direct illumination of the outer disc until it rises out of
this shaded zone because of the intrinsically concave (saucerlike) shape of the disc. The small scale height of the inner
attenuating corona in the soft state means that the outer
disc is directly illuminated in the soft state. Conversely, the
much larger scale height of the inner corona in the hard
state completely shadows the entire disc, so the wind is suppressed. This contrasts with the explanation in D18 where
the thermal wind is still present in the hard state, but is less
visible due to its higher ionisation which is a consequence of
its smaller launch radius (Sec.5). Reality may be a mixture
of the two, as the structure of the hard X-ray source itself
is changing during the transition. The inner disc evaporates
into an X-ray hot flow whose scale height probably increases
as the source dims. Evidence for this is that the electron temperature increases as shown by Motta et al. (2010), which
can be modelled by an expanding hot flow region (Gardner
& Done 2014; Kara et al. 2019; Marcel et al. 2018). The disc
only starts further out, so the inner shadow corona starts
further out, and the larger scale height of the X-rays means
that some fraction can directly illuminate the outer disc as
they extend above the shadow corona. A change in illumination pattern should have observable consequences on the
optical continuum as well as on the X-ray wind properties.
In bright BHB the optical continuum is generally due to reprocessing of X-rays in the outer disc, showing that the outer
disc is illuminated (van Paradijs 1996). This reprocessed optical emission can be seen directly in broadband spectra in
the soft state (Hynes et al. 2002; Kimura & Done 2019),
and especially in fast variability, where the optical emission
is variable on timescales of ∼ 1 − 20 s, lagged behind but
correlated with the X-rays (O’Brien et al. 2002). The hard
state is more complex, but close to the spectral transition
there are still clear signatures that part of the optical emission is produced by reprocessing in the outer disc (Hynes
et al. 2009; Veledina et al. 2017 for Swift J1753, though this
reprocessing signal disappears as the source dims:Veledina
et al. 2017). Simultaneous fast optical and X-ray variability
data can directly measure the changing irradiation pattern
on the disc and test these models of an inner attenuation
zone.
The inner corona can also have an impact on the soft
state spectrum. The shadow affects the corona structure
when it becomes optically thick along the disc direction, but
this is also associated with a vertical optical depth which is
∼ 0.05. Thus 5% of the inner disc flux is scattered rather
than being directly produced in the disc photosphere, and

so at this level, it is clear that the disc emission should differ
from even the best pure disc photosphere calculation such
as those of Davis et al. (2005); Davis & Hubeny (2006). This
high ionisation state layer on top of the disc will also change
the reflected coronal flux from the disc, with around 5% of
the corona flux being scattered from this much higher ionisation state layer than from the disc itself.

CONCLUSIONS

We show that thermal-radiative winds can match the observed wind properties in H1743-322. This includes both
the column density and velocity of the wind seen in the
soft state. We confirm the results of Higginbottom et al.
(2018) that thermal winds alone are too slow, but we show
that radiation pressure (on both electrons and ions) has a
significant effect, producing a force multiplier which transforms these sub-Eddington luminosities to being effectively
super-Eddington. Our model also shows the disappearance
of the wind in the hard state due to complete shadowing
of the outer disc by the inner static corona. There is no
requirement for a magnetic wind to explain the behaviour
of the absorption features observed in this source. We will
use Monte Carlo radiation transfer to explore the detailed
spectra (as in Tomaru et al. 2018) in future work.
The other black hole candidates which show absorption
features from winds are likely also explained by thermalradiative winds, especially those sources which have superEddington luminosities i.e. GRS 1915+105 and (probably)
the anomalous wind seen in one observation of GRO J165540.

APPENDIX A: BASIC EQUATION AND
NUMERICAL METHOD
In this section, we include for completeness the full hydrodynamic equations. We solve these in spherical polar coordinates (R, φ, θ).

where ρ is the mass density, v = (v R, vθ , vφ ) is the velocity,
p is the gas pressure, e is the internal energy per unit mass,
and g = (gR, 0) is the gravitational acceleration of the black
hole. We assume an adiabatic equation of state p/ρ = (γ −1)e
with γ = 5/3.
We set the computational domain from Rin = 0.01Rout ≤
R ≤ Rout , 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2. We solve over NR = 120 grid points
in R and Nθ = 240 grid points in θ. The radial grid is set
with geometric spacing as
Ri = Rin (Rout /Rin )i/N R , (0 ≤ i ≤ NR )

(A6)

We set the polar angular grid in two sections, one to
follow the scale height of the disc to resolve the irradiated

launch region (Eq. 4) and one to sample the wind behaviour
over the rest of the domain. We define these using the angle
from the mid-plain α j = π/2 − θ Nθ −j, (0 ≤ j ≤ Nθ )

where θ 0 = 0, θ Nθ = π/2. The disc surface is the top of Eq.A7.
At each time step, the density of disc surface is updated via
n = L x /(170R2 ), where L x is the filtered continuum.
We run cloudy before the hydrodynamic code, changing the ionisation parameters and temperature to generate
tables of net heating/cooling rate L(ξ, T) and force multiplier
M(ξ, T) in order to input into the hydrodynamic simulations.
This assumes the optically thin limit, which is justified for
the very highly ionised wind conditions which we are trying to reproduce here. The calculation grid of cloudy is
an 301 × 121 logarithmically spaced grid (ξ, T) in a domain
1.0 × 103 ≤ T ≤ 1.0 × 109 and 1.0 × 10−3 ≤ ξ ≤ 1.0 × 1012 .
The hydrodynamic terms for an ideal fluid are solved
using an approximate Reimann solver, the HLL method
(Harten 1983). We treat the radiation force as an explicit
external force term using the force multiplier supplied via
biliner interpolation from pre-calculated cloudy table. The
numerical procedures are i) calculation of Eq.A1–A4 and
Eq.A5 except for the net heating/cooling term, ii) implicit
update of temperature by zbrent root finding method (Press
et al. 1992) (see, also Dyda et al. 2017, A1.2) using net heating/cooling rate via biliner interpolation from pre-calculated
table by cloudy.
The time step is determined using the CourantFriendrichs-Levi condition. At each grid, we calculate
min(δR, Rδθ)
δt = 0.3 p
(v R + cs )2 + (vθ + cs )2

(A8)

where δR, δθ are the grid sizes, while cs is the isothermal
sound speed. The minimum value of δt in all grids is used
as the time step.

APPENDIX B: DENSITY AND
TEMPERATURE STRUCTURE OF ALL
SIMULATIONS
We show the density and temperature structure of simulations with L/LLEdd = 0.3, 0.5 (Fig.B1), that of hard state
(Fig.B3) and the all column densities in Tab. 1.
This paper has been typeset from a TEX/LATEX file prepared by
