[Abstract] LiOsO3 is the first experimentally confirmed polar metal. Previous works
suggested that the ground state of LiOsO3 is just close to the critical point of metal-insulator
transition. In this work the electronic state of LiOsO3 is tuned by epitaxial biaxial strain,
which undergoes the Slater-type metal-insulator transition under tensile strain, i.e., the G-type
antiferromagnetism emerges. The underlying mechanism of bandwidth tuning can be
extended to its sister compound NaOsO3, which shows an opposite transition from a
antiferromagnetic insulator to a nonmagnetic metal under hydrostatic pressure. Our work
suggests a feasible route for the manipulation of magnetism and conductivity of polar metal
LiOsO3.

I. INTRODUCTION
It is well known that metals cannot exhibit ferroelectric distortions because of the
screening effects of the conduction electrons. However, in 1965, Anderson and Blount
suggested that the loss of inversion symmetry could occur in metallic materials through a
continuous structural transition so that polar metals could exist [1]. The first success in the
experimental finding of polar metal is LiOsO3, which was reported to undergo a second-order
structural phase transition from the centrosymmetric structure (space group R 3 c) to the
non-centrosymmetric structure (space group R3c) at temperature T=140 K with metallic
behavior unchanged [2].
The novel properties of polar metal have attracted much attention since the first
experimental report about LiOsO3 in 2013. The major concerns of LiOsO3 are not only the
potential applications but more importantly possible couplings between the ferroelectricity
and metallicity which are usually mutually exclusive. Many efforts have been devoted into
understanding the origin of the ferroelectric-like distortion in the metallic state of LiOsO3, and
1

the microscopic mechanism has been investigated [3-6]. Although several previous
experimental and theoretical studies have demonstrated the primary issues of polar metal, the
physics of LiOsO3 is still puzzling and controversial [2,7-9].
Previous works based on both local density approximation (LDA) + U and LDA +
dynamic meaning field theory (DMFT) both suggested that the ground state of LiOsO3 is just
located near the critical point of metal-insulator transition [10]. If the Coulomb repulsion of
Os5+ is weak enough, the strong hybridization between Os’s 5d and O’s 2p orbitals and
spin-orbit coupling (SOC) will suppress the local magnetic moment in LiOsO3 completely
and then the ground state should be metallic. But if the Coulomb repulsion is significant, a
G-type

antiferromagnetic

(G-AFM)

structure

would

be

established

with

every

nearest-neighboring spins oppositely aligned, and meanwhile LiOsO3 will become an
insulator. For the half-filling t2g orbital of Os5+, the Hubbard U will ideally split the t2g orbitals
into full-filled lower Hubbard bands and empty upper Hubbard bands, with the opposite signs
of periodic potential on each nearest neighbor, i.e. the Slater-type metal-insulator transition
[see Fig. S1 in Supplementary Materials (SM)] [11].
Up to now all experimental evidences showed that LiOsO3 should be a nonmagnetic (NM)
weak-correlated metal, which is different from other 5d3 osmium oxides such as NaOsO3,
Cd2OsO7, etc [12-14]. As clarified in Ref. [10], the main factor that makes LiOsO3 different
from NaOsO3 is the difference between their lattice structures. The Os-O-Os network is more
compact in LiOsO3 than that in NaOsO3, so the 5d-2p hybridization is stronger and the
effective hopping between the nearest-neighbor Os’s 5d orbitals is larger in LiOsO3 than that
in NaOsO3. Hence, the band widths of 5d orbitals in LiOsO3 are relatively wider than those in
NaOsO3. Then the narrower 5d bands of NaOsO3 favor a stable G-AFM structure.
Then it is natural to expect that the suppressed magnetic ordering of LiOsO3 could be
revived by reducing the kinetic energy of 5d electrons which enhances the electron
localization. Puggioni et al. proposed a strategy of electronic structure control in LiOsO3 by
enhancing the electronic correlations in the LiOsO3 layers of an ultrashort period
LiOsO3/LiNbO3 superlattice, and their calculation showed that the insulating and magnetic
state of LiOsO3 could be driven by the reduction of bandwidth of t2g orbitals in the
superlattice geometry [15].
In this manuscript, we will consider an simpler route, i.e. to apply biaxial strains, to tune
the distances between ions in the Os-O-Os network of LiOsO3. Then under the tensile case,
the itinerant electrons should be more localized and the magnetic order is expectable.
Although the strain effects were addressed before, the magnetism was neglected [16,17].
Using the first-principles density functional theory (DFT), our calculation reveals that LiOsO3
2

will turn into G-AFM insulator with the unchanged crystal symmetry under tensile biaxial
strain. Our results suggest an alternative route for the manipulation of the physical properties
and functionality of LiOsO3.
II. COMPUTATION METHODS
The DFT calculations are performed using the pseudo-potential plane wave method as
implemented in Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) [18-20]. The electron
interactions are described using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) of the generalized
gradient approximation (GGA) [21]. The projected augmented wave (PAW) [22]
pseudo-potentials with a 500 eV plane-wave cutoff are used, including three valence electrons
for Li (1s22s1), nine for Na (2s22p63s1), fourteen for Os (5p66s25d6), and six for O (2s22p4).
Starting from the experimental structures, the lattice constants and all atomic coordinates are
fully relaxed within the initial space group, until the Hellman-Feynman forces on every atom
are converged to less than 1.0 meV/Å. A 13×13×7 mesh for the cell of LiOsO3 in R3c
hexagonal phase (containing 30 atoms), and a 13×13×13 mesh for the unit cell of NaOsO3 are
used for the Brillouin-zone sampling.
The Coulomb repulsion in correlated electron systems is usually characterized by the
on-site Hubbard U. Since the Coulomb repulsion should be insignificant in 5d systems
because of the spatially extended 5d orbitals, we have carefully investigated the ground state
of LiOsO3 by performing two different types of DFT + U methods [10]: the LDA + U method
introduced by Liechtenstein et al. in which the exchange splitting J and the Hubbard U are
considered separately and the simplified LSDA (local spin density approximate) + U method
introduced by Dudarev et al. which only needs a parameter Ueff =U-J [23,24]. In the LDA + U
case, the suitable value of Hubbard U in LiOsO3 should be in the range of 1.0~2.0 eV; but in
LSDA+U case, the value of Ueff should be small enough (~0 eV), i.e. a bare LSDA calculation
is a proper choice.
In our calculations, the space groups are kept unchanging upon the external strain or
pressure, i.e. structural transition is not taken into account although it may occur in some
cases [25,26]. To guarantee this assumption, the dynamic stability of lattice will be checked
using its phonon spectrum as well as the elastic coefficients [27] (Fig. S2 in SM). The
ferroelectric polarization for the insulating state is calculated using the Berry phase method
[28,29]. The total spontaneous polarization P for a given crystalline symmetry can be
calculated as the sum of ionic and electronic contributions.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
We take the hexagonal cell of LiOsO3 in the non-centrosymmetric phase of R3c as the
3

reference structure, as shown in Fig. 1(a). First, previous works have proved that the magnetic
phase of LiOsO3 could only be NM or G-AFM whatever the condition is [3,9,10,15]. So in
the following we only consider the competition between the NM phase and G-AFM phase.
The total and partial density of states (DOS) are shown in Fig. 1(b-c). As expected, LiOsO3 is
insulating in the G-AFM state while the NM state is metallic. For both cases, Os’s 5d orbitals
and O’s 2p orbitals are overlapped around the Fermi level, suggesting the strong hybridization
between them. Due to the crystalline electric field, the Os’s 5d orbitals are split into the t2g
triplet manifold and eg doublet manifold. Thus the magnetic configuration will be formed by
the total moment of the half-filled t2g orbitals of Os5+.

total and partial density of states (DOS) of LiOsO3 (per f.u.) in (b) NM state and (c) G-AFM
state, calculated by LSDA.
In order to reduce the t2g bandwidth of Os5+ via making Os-O-Os network looser, we
consider to apply biaxial strain which can be achieved in experiments by epitaxial growth
techniques. In crystals with R3c space group, the lattice parameter a equals to the lattice
parameter b. The a/b plane biaxial strain is defined as  =(a-a0)/a0, where a0 is the optimized
lattice parameter for the fully relaxed LiOsO3. We study the ground state of LiOsO3 under an
appreciable range of strains, from -5% to 5%, while the negative numbers represent
compressive strain and the positive numbers represent tensile strain. With constrained a/b, the
out-of-plane lattice parameter c and internal atomic coordinates are fully relaxed, and the
crystal symmetry of the LiOsO3 cell is kept unchanged at the R3c space group during the
optimized process (whose stability is further verified, see Fig. S2 in SM).
To accurately confirm the magnetic order of LiOsO3 under biaxial strains, first we
perform the LSDA + SOC calculation on LiOsO3, here the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is
considered because that several works have found that SOC may play a significant role in the
magnetic properties of 5d osmium oxides [14,30-32]. We compare the total energy of LiOsO3
cell in the NM state and G-AFM state. The results are summarized in Fig. 2(a-c). We can see
4

that the energy difference between the total energy of LiOsO3 cell in the NM state and
G-AFM state varies with the magnitude of strain. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the total energy of
LiOsO3 in the NM state would gradually go beyond that in the G-AFM state as the magnitude
of strain increasing, which means the ground state of LiOsO3 turn from the NM phase to
G-AFM phase. Within a certain range of tensile strain (~>2%), the G-AFM state would be the
most stable for LiOsO3. In other cases, the ground state of LiOsO3 would remain in the NM
state. In practice, the possible substrate candidates may be LiTaO3 (~2.15% larger) or the (111)
surface of LaAlO3 or YAlO3 (6.1% or 3.8 % larger). The magnetic moment and band gap are
also growing with the tensile strain, as presented in Fig. 2(b-c), indicating that the G-AFM
phase becomes more and more stable as the magnitude of tensile strain increases.

The energy difference between the G-AFM state and NM state (E=ENM–EG-AFM). (b) The
magnetic moment of Os ion in the G-AFM state. (c) The band gap of LiOsO3 in the G-AFM
state.
In order to reveal the underlying physical mechanism, the calculated structural parameters
of LiOsO3 as a function of strain are shown in Fig. S3 in SM. Under the tensile condition, the
nearest-neighbor Os-Os distance (as well as Os-O-Os bond angle) becomes larger due to the
expanded in-plane lattice constant although the out-of-plane lattice constant is shrunk. The
compressive strain leads to the opposite tendency. Obviously, the longer Os-O bond and the
larger distance between the nearest-neighbor Os-Os pair reduce the orbital hybridization and
5

thus the bandwidth.
To verify the mechanism of tensile strains, the partial DOS of 5d orbitals of each Os in
the G-AFM state is plotted in Fig. 3(a). Here two cases are compared: unstrained and +3%
tensile strained. As expected, the band width of t2g orbitals in the latter case is narrower that in
the former case. So when the magnitude of tensile strain go beyond the critical point, the 5d
electrons of Os5+ would tend to be localized and prefer to establish the G-AFM structure,
which agrees with our expectation.

and +3% tensile strained, calculated by LSDA. (b) The calculated ferroelectric polarization (P)
along the c-axis as a function of biaxial strain .
The linear optical properties LiOsO3 in the G-AFM state under tensile strains is also
studied as a fringerprint of electronic structure. The calculated linear optical absorption
coefficients before phase transition (undistorted) and after phase transition (+3% tensile strain)
are shown in Fig. S4 in SM. Two main absorption peaks exist: one is located between 1.0 eV
and 1.3 eV, the other is located between 3.5 eV and 4.5 eV. The first absorption peak is
probably caused by electron transition from O’s 2p orbital below Fermi level to Os’s t2g
orbital, and the second absorption peak may be caused by electron transition from O’s 2p
orbital to Os’s eg orbital. The valleys located between 2.2 eV and 2.5 eV should be attributed
to the gap between eg orbital and t2g orbital. It is obvious that the location of absorption peak
is red-shifting under tensile strain, indicating that the energy level of Os’s 5d orbital is
decreasing. This feature confirms that tensile strain could make the bandwidth of 5d orbitals
narrower as we expected.

6

In addition to above LSDA calculations, we also perform LDA+U calculation on strained
LiOsO3 (the magnitude of strain is set to +3%) to confirm that our results is not dependent on
particular computing method. We set J/U = 0.25 and restrict the range of U in 1.0~2.0 eV. The
energy difference between the G-AFM phase and NM phase and the magnetic moment of
Os5+ are shown in Fig. S5 in SM as a function of U. In the LDA+U calculation, the tensile
strain can enlarge the energy difference between G-AFM phase and NM phase and increase
the local magnetic moment. Hence, both the LSDA calculation and LDA+U calculation reach
the same conclusion.
Since the G-AFM structure could open a gap in the Fermi level of LiOsO3, we can
calculate the spontaneous ferroelectric polarization in the non-centrosymmetric LiOsO3 cell.
The ferroelectric polarization is calculated using the Berry phase approach. The polarization is
presented in Fig. 3(c) as a function of strain, which decreases with the increasing magnitude
of strain. Clearly, the polar displacements in LiOsO3 will be reduced by tensile biaxial strains.
This result is easy to be understood since the polar displacements in LiOsO3 are
predominantly along the c-axis [2], and thus the reduced lattice constant along the c-axis
suppresses the polarization.
Consequently, since we can manipulate the ground state of LiOsO3 by applying tensile
strain, then could we change the G-AFM insulating phase in NaOsO3 into NM metallic phase
via compressive strain considering the similarities of their structures? Our calculation indeed
predicts that such magnetic transition can occur when the biaxial compression is beyond -8%
(Fig. S6 in SM), which may be too large in practice.
Considering the feasibility for experiment, we consider the hydrostatic pressure on
NaOsO3 crystal instead, which can reach a similar effect. We optimize the structure of
NaOsO3 under pressures and then study the magnetic and electronic properties at the ground
state. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the ground state of NaOsO3 would turn into NM metallic phase
under a relatively large pressure (>35 GPa) while the crystal symmetry is kept unchanged
(whose dynamic stability is further verified according to the elastic coefficients. See SM for
more details). Even for the G-AFM state, the pressure can suppress the local magnetic
moment, as shown in Fig. 4(b). We compare the partial DOS of undistorted cell with the one
under 50 GPa, as shown in Fig. 4(c), which indicates that the band widths of 5d orbitals are
clearly wider under pressure. That means the applied hydrostatic pressure makes the Os-O-Os
network more compact so that the 5d electrons will be more delocalized and the effective
hopping between nearest-neighbor Os-Os pair’s 5d orbitals are larger, eventually lead to the
quenching of the local moment of Os5+ (5d3) in NaOsO3.

IV. CONCLUSION
In summary, we have performed first-principles calculations to study the effects of biaxial
strains on LiOsO3. It is revealed that the ground state of LiOsO3 would change from NM
metal into G-AFM insulator under tensile biaxial strain. This magnetic phase transition would
cause a Slater-type metal-insulator transition. The physical mechanism for the strain-induced
phase transition in LiOsO3 can also be applied to NaOsO3. Oppositely, the ground state of
NaOsO3 would turn from G-AFM insulator into NM metal under sufficiently large hydrostatic
pressure. Our results suggest a feasible way to manipulate the electronic and magnetic
properties of polar metal LiOsO3. Our work would motivate new applications of polar metal
materials.
