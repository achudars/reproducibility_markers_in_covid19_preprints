Abstract
We study portal interactions connecting visible and dark sectors, and involving local interactions of a
photon, a dark photon and a axion-like particle (ALP) at future e+ e− colliders. These interactions,
mediated by higher-dimensional effective operators, may arise at one-loop by kinetic mixing between
dark and ordinary photons, or, for massless dark photons, by direct short-distance contributions.
We explore these portal interactions for a heavy ALP with masses between about 10 GeV and
230 GeV by investigating the sensitivity of the production e+ e− → γγγ̄ to the effective couplings,
where the dark photon γ̄ gives rise to missing momentum in the final state. We will show how an
appropriate choice of missing-energy and missing-mass cuts can optimize the signal to standardmodel background ratio. Exclusion regions for the effective photon-dark-photon-ALP couplings
versus the ALP mass are worked out for a few representative values of the collision energy and
integrated luminosity, as presently envisaged by future e+ e− projects.

INTRODUCTION

The persistent global consistency of the Standard Model (SM) predictions against the data collected so far at the
CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is radically changing our perspective on the origin of possible new physics beyond
the SM, and on its characteristic energy scale. This is also supported by the Higgs boson discovery [1], which is in
good agreement with SM expectations [2, 3]. On the other hand, the growing evidences for dark matter (DM) [4], and
the lack of suitable DM candidates in the SM framework are strengthening the possibility of the existence of physics
beyond the SM, provided DM does not have a purely gravitational origin, as in the case of primordial black holes. A
proper new physics model should be able to explain the correct dark-matter relic abundance and other experimental
constraints coming from the direct and indirect searches for DM, while keeping itself well decoupled from ordinary
matter in order to escape present TeV-range constraints in the LHC searches.
The present picture can motivate the idea that the new physics responsible for DM might reside in a hidden or
Dark Sector (DS), the latter consisting of new particles which are singlets under the SM gauge interactions. The
DS can eventually interact with the SM via some portal-type interactions, mediated by heavy messengers which can
communicate tree-level interactions between the SM and the DS fields [5]. This mechanism can give rise to lowenergy effective interactions between SM and DS particles induced by higher-dimensional operators, the latter being
suppressed by the characteristic scale of the messenger fields. Then, a quite heavy messenger sector might naturally
explain why the new physics, and in particular the DM sector, is still escaping all direct and indirect searches [5].
A DS might contain a light or ultralight subsector. It might also be charged under its own long-distance interactions,
in complete agreement with cosmological and astrophysical observations. Long-range forces mediated by a massless
dark photon, corresponding to an exact U (1)D gauge symmetry in the DS, might also have a role in this picture. A
DS scenario of the latter kind, which aims to solve the hierarchy puzzle of the SM Yukawa couplings, also providing
natural DM candidates, has been recently proposed in [6, 7], implying a possible deep connection between the origin
of Flavor and the DM interpretation.

Dark-photon scenarios (both in the massive and massless cases) have been extensively considered in the literature in new-physics extensions of the SM gauge group [5],[8]. They have also been investigated in cosmology and
astrophysics [9–16], mainly for improving models predictions.
In collider physics, most of present dark-photon searches focus on massive dark photons, where the broken U (1)D
gauge field naturally develops by kinetic mixing a tree-level (milli-charged) interaction with ordinary charged matter [8]. However, a massless dark photon can behave in a radically different way with respect to a massive one.
Indeed, the kinetic mixing among the ordinary photon and a massless dark photon can be rotated away, restricting
dark-photon interactions with ordinary matter to higher-dimensional operators [8]. Most of present astrophysical and
laboratory constraints applying to massive dark photons can be evaded in the massless case, allowing for potentially
large U (1)D couplings in the DS [13].
The DS could also contain the so-called Axion-Like Particles (ALP’s), a, loosely referring to neutral light (or
ultralight) scalar (or pseudo-scalar) particles. These particles can be present in SM extensions motivated by the
solution to the strong-CP problem (in which case the ALP is a QCD axion [17]) or can be pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone
bosons corresponding to spontaneously broken continuous symmetries, either in the visible or in the DS, or a moduli
field in string models [18–21].
In the literature, the phenomenological aspects, including collider search of ALP’s, have been extensively studied [22–28]. Most of these studies focus on the ALP effective coupling to photons and/or gluons via the usual
a F µνF̃µν and a GµνG̃µν types of interaction, involving the photon and gluon field-strength tensors, respectively. In a
possible theory UV completion, this kind of effective interactions could result (at one loop) from integrating out some
heavy messenger fields connecting the dark and the observable sectors. Then the effective scale could be identified
with the typical mass of the messengers running in the loop, properly rescaled by the product of internal couplings
and loop factor suppressions.
While fixed-target experiments [29, 30] and B factories [31] are particularly useful for searching new weaklycoupled particles like ALP’s in the MeV-GeV range, high-energy colliders are more effective for constraining ALP
masses above a few GeV’s. Collider investigations carried out so far in this context, involving the aforementioned
dimension-five operators, mostly focused on tri-photon and/or mono-photon+missing-energy signatures (depending
on the ALP stability at the detector length scale) in the context of past and future e+ e− collider experiments as well
as of (HL-)LHC experiments [22, 23, 25–28].
Motivated by the above scenarios, we analyze a different type of portal interactions, that is Dark-ALP portals which
connect the visible sector and the DS via a higher-dimensional effective operator aF µνF̄˜µν , involving a photon γ, a
dark photon γ̄ and an ALP a, being F̄µν the dark-photon field strength. The aγγ̄ interaction can arise from the usual
ALP coupling with photons, a F µνF̃µν , after rotating away the kinetic mixing in the photon dark-photon sector, or
can directly be induced at one loop by short-distance effects, after integrating out some heavy messenger fields. The
same kind of interactions has been considered in the context of various low-energy constraints in [32–34].
<
We are now going to focus on a massive ALP scenario, with the a mass Ma in the range of 10 GeV <
∼ Ma ∼ 230 GeV,
and a massless dark photon. Indeed, the new effective operator not only provides a rich phenomenology in the context
of astrophysical and cosmological observations, including the possibility of low-energy observations, but also opens up
new ALP search strategies at collider experiments. In particular, we propose to look at the di-photon plus missingenergy channel e+ e− → γγγ̄ with the aim to probe both the a F µνF̃µν and a F µνF̄˜µν types of effective operators, in
the context of future e+ e− collider experiments. As we will argue, this new channel not only has a better signal-tobackground ratio compared to the conventional tri-photon channel, even before imposing any hard cut on the final
state objects. It also has more distinct kinematical features as compared to its SM background counterpart, thanks to
the presence of a massless invisible dark-photon in the final state. We will illustrate how such signal can be efficiently
separated from the SM background by adopting various unconventional kinematic observables. In particular, we find
that requiring an almost vanishing missing mass in the final state is particular effective in separating most of the SM
background.
While in the following we will assume new interactions involving a pseudoscalar ALP coupling, our results can be
easily generalized for a neutral scalar particle.
The present search can be of relevance for the various e+ e− collider projects that are presently under discussion, in
particular for the linear colliders ILC [35], and CLIC [36], and for the circular options FCC-ee [37, 38] and CEPC [39].
We will assume as reference for the collision center-of-mass (c.m.) energies, and integrated luminosities, the ones
corresponding to the FCC-ee staging [40]. A straightforward projection for the setup corresponding to a different
machine can be done in most cases.
We have organized the present paper in the following way. In the next section, we discuss the theoretical framework
under consideration, and various constraints relevant for the present study. In Section III, after presenting the LEP
data implications on the present model, we suggest a new collider search strategy and corresponding event selection
criteria at future e+ e− colliders. Section IV contains the results of our analyses. Finally, our conclusions are reported

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

A portal interaction connecting the dark sector and the visible sector can be parametrized in the following way
Lef f =

Λ

(1)

where F µν and F̄µν are respectively the field strength of the photon γ and the dark photon γ̄, a is the ALP field,
Caγ γ̄,aγ γ̄ are dimensionless couplings, and Λ is some high energy scale1 [32]. In principle, one could also add a term
C γ̄

of the form aγ̄
Λ a F̄ F̄µν which might be present as well if one consider a specific UV completion of the low energy
theory. In our analyses this term doesn’t play any role apart from modifying the ALP decay width, and hence the
branching fractions of ALP decays.
In specific UV completions of the low energy theory, all these effective couplings can be related to each other.
However, their connection will be in general model dependent. For instance, one could have an additional vertex
C
involving the Z boson, namely aΛZ γ̄ aFZµνF̄˜µν , where FZµν is the Z field strength, related to the interactions in Eq.(1).
In the following, we will take these couplings as independent parameters, assume that the contribution from CaZ γ̄
is negligible with respect to the two photon’s operators, and consider only the effects of the two dominant terms
in Eq.(1).

energy of e+ e− collisions. Actually, the existing experimental limits related to ALP searches are mostly sensitive to a
light ALP [in particular, lighter than O(GeV)], and come from e.g. beam dump and light shining wall experiments,
LSND and MinibooNE experiments, lepton g − 2 [5]. Given the ALP mass range we consider in the present analysis,
most of the stringent bounds on the axion coupling Caγγ /Λ in Eq.(1) carried out for very light ALP’s can be neglected.
III.

DARK-ALP PORTAL WITH HEAVY ALP’S AT e+ e− COLLIDERS

In order to probe both the ALP-photon-photon, aγγ, and ALP-photon-dark-photon, aγγ̄, couplings, as defined in
Eq.(1), we study the e+ e− → γγγ̄ process at electron-positron colliders, where the dark photon γ̄ behaves in the
detector just like a neutrino, i.e. giving rise to massless missing momentum [41].
One of the main advantages of the di-photon+missing-energy channel over the conventional tri-photon
√ channel
(associated to the process e+ e− → aγ → γγγ) is the smaller SM background. As for illustration, at s ' MZ
the SM background in the tri-photon channel is about 4 pb with nominal cuts on the photon energy p
(Eγ > 2 GeV)
and rapidity (|η| < 2.5) along with the isolation between any photon pair (∆R > 0.01 where, ∆R = ∆η 2 + ∆φ2 ),
whereas that in the di-photon+missing-energy channel coming from γγν ν̄ production is about 0.1 pb. √
As collision c.m. energy, we consider the energies foreseen by the FCC-ee present staging, that is s ' [MZ ,
160 GeV, 240 GeV], with
integrated luminosity L ' [150, 10, 5] ab−1 , respectively [40] (leaving aside here possible
√
higher energy runs at s ' 365 GeV). The corresponding results for the ILC and CEPC cases, and some extrapolation
to the CLIC energies, can be anyway obtained in a quite straightforward way from the present discussion.
The e+ e− → γγγ̄ process arises from the couplings in Eq.(1) via the Feynman diagrams detailed in Figure 1. The
two diagrams interfere in a constructive way. Assuming Caγγ = Caγ γ̄ = 1, the contribution due to interference varies
from 4% to about 17% of the total cross section within the ALP mass range considered in this analyses. The dominant
contributions come from the incoherent sum of the individual sub-processes. The impact of interference effects can of
course change as one moves away from the Caγγ = Caγ γ̄ = 1 assumption (a similar behaviour affects the ALP total
width corresponding to the decays a → γγ̄, γγ).

The factor 2 in the second term has been introduced to take into account the effect of the Wick contractions in the first term arising
from the matrix element with two external photon states.

FIG. 1: Feynman diagrams for the signal sub-processes e+ e− → γa → γγγ̄ and e+ e− → γ̄a → γγγ̄

In the e+ e− → γγγ̄ process, the ALP is produced on-shell, and it further undergoes a two body-decay to γγ or
γγ̄. This helps a lot in the characterisation of the signal versus the SM background, which is mainly arising from
the e+ e− → γγ ν̄ν process, for an invisible dark photon. Indeed, one can treat the signal events as a 2 → 2 → 3
process (modulo interference effects) and the momenta of the final state particles are correspondingly constrained, with
different constraints for different subprocesses. On the other hand, the background e+ e− → γγ ν̄ν is characterised by
2 → 4 and 2 → 3 → 4 sub-processes, and the corresponding phase-space behaviour is in general significantly different
from the signal one. The presence of the missing momentum associated to a single invisible massless dark photon in
the final state will provide a crucial additional handle to separate the signal from the SM background.
In the following we use the MadGraph5 event generator [42] to simulate both the signal and the background
events. We have implemented the effective ALP vertices using the FeynRules packages (v2.0) [43]. The output of the
FeynRules (UFO model files) is then interfaced with MadGraph5 (v2.6.3.2).

LEP Analysis

The effective aγγ̄ interactions between the ALP, photon and dark-photon can already be tested and constrained
using the existing LEP data [44]. The L3 collaboration searched√for single or multi-photon events with missing
energy arising from e+ e− → ν̄νγ(γ), in the c.m. energy range s = (189 − 208) GeV, with a total integrated
luminosity of 619 pb−1 . In Table I, we show the number of predicted signal events in our model, and the expected
SM background events, along with the observed data in the multiphoton+missing-energy channel, after applying the
set of cuts described in [44].

We have also estimated the corresponding 2σ exclusion limits on the model parameters (i.e., Caγγ and Caγ γ̄ , at
fixed Ma and Λ) coming from the LEP analysis, and presented them in the following sections. Note that the LEP
analysis of the multiphoton+missing-energy channel has not been optimized for the e+ e− → γγγ̄ process. In the next
subsection, we will discuss the relevant optimization strategy in the context of future e+ e− colliders.

Future e+ e− colliders

In this section we discuss the prospect of the e+ e− → γγγ̄ in the context of future e+ e− colliders. We start by
discussing the signal cross section and the event selection criteria taking into account various kinematical distributions.
First we plot in Figure 2 the ALP total decay width (left), and the total e+ e− → γγγ̄ cross section (right) versus
the ALP mass, assuming Caγγ = Caγ γ̄ = 1 and Λ = 1 TeV. The left plot shows how, even for ALP masses as low as
10 GeV, the ALP is not stable on the detector length scale down to couplings of the order Caγγ , Caγ γ̄ ∼ 10−4 , with
Λ ∼ 1 TeV, for which the decay length is of the order of 0.1 mm. For narrower ALP widths, a displaced-vertices
strategy might be in order.

In order to reconstruct signal events as events containing at least two isolated photons with some missing energy,
we impose the following set of basic cuts on the final-state observables (in the following, we call C1 this set of basic
cuts for the diphoton+missing-energy events):
• minimum energy for each photon, Eγ > 2. GeV,
• maximum rapidity for each photon, |ηγ | < 2.5,
• angular separation between any pair of photons greater than 15o ,
/ T > 5. GeV.
• minimum missing transverse energy, E

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We now present the results of our analyses. The final choice of the event selection criteria is a natural consequence
/
of the kinematic distributions discussed in the previous section.
√ The combination of the missing energy E and missing
/
mass M cuts reduces the SM background substantially. For s ' MZ and 160 GeV, the optimized choice of cuts is
independent of the ALP masses. This is because both the missing-energy and the missing-mass distributions have
/ distributions,
very small or almost negligible overlap with background events. On the other hand, on the basis of E

9
√
one
a mild Ma dependence is expected at s = 240 GeV. However, we could obtain a significance very close to √
corresponding to the Ma dependent optimized cuts, by adopting the same (rescaled) cut choice as used at lower s.
In Tables II, III and IV, we present the numerical results of our analysis for a few representative Ma benchmarks
in order to illustrate the effects of the cut-flow on the signal and the background events discussed earlier, at various
e+ e− collision energies. The signal events reported correspond to Caγγ = Caγ γ̄ = 1 and Λ = 1 TeV, and can be
easily rescaled for different couplings and energy scale. We name σcut , the residual cross sections after applying the
complete cut-flow to the process phase-space.

γγν ν̄ background at s = 240 GeV (versus Ma ), applying the C1 set of basic cuts as described in the text, followed by further

In Figures 9, 10 and 11, we show the exclusion plot in the (Cax , Ma ) plane, where Caγγ = Caγ γ̄ = Cax , for various
c.m. energies and corresponding expected integrated luminosities. The 2σ limit has been obtained by assuming for
the signal significance the following definition

10
where S and B are the numbers of observed signal and background events, respectively, corresponding to the
residual signal and background cross sections σcut in Tables √
II–IV. One can see that the 2σ reach for Ma ∼10 GeV
is less sensitive compared to the one for Ma ∼ 20 GeV, at s = 160 and 240 GeV, despite the large production
cross section in this mass region. The decrease in sensitivity at low Ma is due to the effect of the photon isolation
requirement when the two photons coming from the ALP decay are mostly collimated. This effectively reduces the
cut efficiency. On the other hand, the 2σ limit on the couplings becomes less sensitive at larger Ma values, because
of the corresponding lower production cross section.

and have much better reach in the (Caγγ , Caγ γ̄ ) plane, thanks to both a higher luminosity and to the optimized
selection strategy. The significance definition in Eq.(6) is used everywhere to make this comparison.

LEP analysis as described in the text. We have assumed Λ = 1 TeV.

One can notice from the plots in Figures 12 and 13, that when one of the couplings is much lower than the other,
the sensitivity to the smaller coupling is independent of the latter. This feature arises from the scaling of the cross
section with the couplings, when ignoring interference effects. Indeed, the cross section for the e+ e− → γγγ̄ process
2
scales as σ(e+ e− → γγγ̄) ≈ Caγγ
[σ1 + ΓΓ12 σ2 ] for Caγγ  Caγ γ̄ , while for Caγ γ̄  Caγγ the scaling is given by
Γ2
+ −
2
σ(e e → γγγ̄) ≈ Caγ γ̄ [ Γ1 σ1 + σ2 ] [where the factors σ1 = σ(e+ e− → γa), σ2 = σ(e+ e− → γ̄a), Γ1 = Γ(a → γγ),
and Γ2 = Γ(a → γγ̄) are all evaluated at Caγγ = Caγ γ̄ = 1 and Λ = 1 TeV]. Therefore the total cross section in either
of these limits roughly scales with the smallest of the two couplings squared, and becomes independent of the other.

shown. The black dashed line in the left figure represents the bound coming from the LEP analysis as described in the text,
for Ma = 150 GeV. We have assumed Λ = 1 TeV.

Furthermore, the sensitivity of the exclusion limit in the (Caγγ , Caγ γ̄ ) plane for fixed Ma is not symmetric in the
two couplings. The sensitivity reach for Caγ γ̄ is indeed slightly better than that for Caγγ . This is because, the partial
widths Γ2 and Γ1 enter in the expression for the cross sections describing the scaling (just defined) in inverted ratios,
and ΓΓ12 > 1.
Figures 12 and 13 indeed show that, when there is a clear hierarchy in the aγγ and aγγ̄ couplings, the 2σ exclusion
dependence is restricted to just the smallest coupling. However, in case a e+ e− → γγγ̄ signal were detected, our
analysis would not be able to distinguish the corresponding hierarchical ordering of the two couplings.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have considered an axion-like particle with mass in the range (10−230) GeV, coupled to a photon and a massless
dark-photon through higher-dimensional effective operators. Such operators may occur naturally in a theory which
includes light pseudo-scalar and dark-photon particles, and can be generated at the loop level by heavy messenger
particles charged under both U (1)em and U (1)D . We have investigated the future collider prospects for a scenario
including these effective operators. In particular, we have thoroughly studied and lay down the strategy to probe a
Dark-ALP portal as defined in Eq.(1), at future e+ e− colliders. The conventional search for three-photon final states
/ signature arising from the e+ e− → γγγ̄ process,
(which does not include the aγγ̄ coupling) is replaced by the 2γ + E
with the missing momentum arising from the dark-photon in the collision final state well characterized by a vanishing
missing mass. We assumed a prompt ALP decay on a typical-detector length scale. The main SM background
coming from the e+ e− → γγν ν̄ channel can then be controlled by proper cutflows on the most sensitive kinematic
/ and missing mass M
/ . Relevant kinematical distributions and consequent
variables, namely the missing energy E
selection strategies for the e+ e− → γγγ̄ process have been analysed. The missing mass variable associated to the
dark photon turns out to be particularly efficient for the S/B optimization. Projections at future e+ e− colliders for
the corresponding constraints on the aγγ and aγγ̄ couplings have been discussed. For ALP masses not too close
to the production threshold, the FCC-ee has in general the potential to constrain down to O(10−3 − 10−4 ) the
ALP-photon-photon (aγγ) and ALP-photon-dark-photon (aγγ̄) couplings, as defined in Eq.(1), assuming Λ = 1 TeV.
Note that our analysis is not sensitive to the CP-property of the produced scalar particle, and can also be effectively
used to probe possible couplings of CP-even scalars to photons and dark-photons, if occurring in particular new physics
scenarios.
The corresponding search strategies for the ILC, CLIC, CEPC collision-energy and integrated-luminosity setups
can be inferred by the present analysis in a quite straightforward way.
