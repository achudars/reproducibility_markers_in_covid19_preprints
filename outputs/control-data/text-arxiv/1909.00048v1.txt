CLOSED SUBSETS OF A CAT(0) 2-COMPLEX ARE
INTRINSICALLY CAT(0)
RUSSELL RICKS

Abstract. Let κ ≤ 0, and let X be a locally-finite CAT(κ) polyhedral 2complex X, each face with constant curvature κ. Let E be a closed, rectifiablyconnected subset of X with trivial first singular homology. We show that E,
under the induced path metric, is a complete CAT(κ) space.

CAT(κ) spaces are a well-studied generalization of nonpositive curvature from
Riemannian manifolds to metric spaces. Many combinatorial constructions, such
as Mκ -polyhedral complexes, involve gluing together pieces of well-understood
CAT(κ) spaces to form new ones. We extend the class of known examples by taking closed subsets of 2-dimensional polyhedral CAT(κ) spaces and considering the
induced path metric; under proper assumptions, these subspaces are also CAT(κ).
In [3], we showed that any closed, simply-connected, rectifiably-connected subset
of the plane (with a constant curvature κ ≤ 0 metric) is a complete CAT(κ) space
when endowed with the induced path metric. In this paper, we extend this result
to similar subspaces of a CAT(κ) polyhedral 2-complex. In particular, we prove
the following result.
Theorem A (Theorem 6.1). Let E be a closed, rectifiably-connected subspace of a
locally-finite CAT(κ) Mκ -polyhedral 2-complex X, where κ ≤ 0. If H1 (E) = 0 then
E, under the induced path metric, is a complete CAT(κ) space.
(Throughout this paper, we assume κ ≤ 0.)
We remark that another potential route to prove Theorem A is to solve the
isoperimetric inequality for simple closed curves [2]. Unfortunately, it is not clear
how to do this; in particular, the behavior of simple closed curves can be rather
subtle in a CAT(κ) 2-complex (see Example 1.4 below, for instance), and there is
no general 1-Lipschitz retraction from the full 2-complex to a closed subset, even if
the subset is contractible.
The paper proceeds as follows: We first generalize some aspects of the Jordan
Curve Theorem to the context of CAT(κ) 2-complexes (Theorem 2.8). This allows
us to make assertions about the behavior of curves in Y at the points where they
are locally geodesic (Lemma 3.4). Finally, we reduce the theorem to the case where
X is planar, and use a characterization of angles proved in [3, Theorem B].
The author would like to thank Eric Swenson for suggesting the problem.

Let X be a geodesic space, and let ∠p (q, r) be the angle at p in the comparison
triangle 4(p, q, r) in Mκ2 for 4(p, q, r). Suppose σ : [0, 1] → X and τ : [0, 1] → X are
constant-speed geodesic segments emanating from the point p ∈ X, with σ(1) = q
and τ (1) = r. The Alexandrov angle between σ and τ is defined as
∠p (σ, τ ) = lim

If X is uniquely geodesic, we can define Alexandrov angle at p between q and r to
be
0
∠p (q, r) = lim+ sup ∠(0)
p (σ(t), τ (t )).
→0

0<t,t0 <

We will use the following characterization of CAT(κ) spaces [1, Proposition II.1.7(4)].
Definition 1.1. For a geodesic metric space X, and κ ≤ 0, we say that X is
(κ)
CAT(κ) if ∠p (q, r) ≤ ∠p (q, r) for every triple of distinct points p, q, r ∈ X.
Every CAT(κ) space (with κ ≤ 0) is a CAT(0) space, and every CAT(0) space
is uniquely geodesic. For more on CAT(κ) spaces, we refer the reader to [1].
Definition 1.2. For distinct points x and y in a uniquely geodesc metric space Z,
write [x, y]Z for the geodesic in Z between x and y.
Throughout this paper, we will assume X is a locally-finite CAT(κ) Mκ2 -polyhedral
2-complex. The technical hypotheses that X be locally finite and that each face of
X has curvature κ ensure that every point p ∈ X has a conical neighborhood —that
is, an open neighborhood isometric to a convex open set in the κ-cone over the link
of p, and this isometry maps p to the cone point [1, Theorem I.7.39].
We will often identify a simple closed curve with its image throughout the paper.
Definition 1.3. Let γ be a simple closed curve in X. Define the interior of γ to
be
Int γ = {x ∈ X r γ : [γ] 6= 0 ∈ H1 (X r {x})} .
Note that γ ∪ Int γ is the intersection of the images of all singular 2-chains with
boundary γ. In particular, γ ∪ Int γ is compact.
We remark that the interior of a simple closed curve can be somewhat subtle, as
the following example illustrates.
Example 1.4. Let X be the CAT(0) Euclidean 2-complex formed by gluing three
flat half-planes H1 , H2 , H3 = {(x, y) : x ≥ 0}, along the boundary edge of each. Let
γ be a simple closed curve in X that follows the following pattern (see Figure 1):
Trace arcs from (0, −1) to (0, 1) in H1 , then from (0, 1) to (0, −2) in H2 , then from
(0, −2) to (0, 3) in H3 , then from (0, 3) to (0, −3) in H1 , then from (0, −3) to (0, 2)
in H2 , then from (0, 2) to (0, −1) in H3 . The interior of γ is homeomorphic to a
punctured torus (not a disk). It is also not open in X.
Notice that replacing H1 by π1 in the definition of Int γ defines a strictly larger
set in this example—the point (0, 0) ∈ X, for instance, lies in Intπ1 γ but not in
IntH1 γ.
2. The Curve Theorem
The interior of a simple closed curve in X is not open in general, but it is when
restricted to the faces (i.e., open 2-cells) of X.

Figure 1. The interior of the simple closed curve γ of Example 1.4
is not homeomorphic to a disk, nor is it open. And though γ is
nullhomologous in γ ∪ Int γ, it is not nullhomotopic (in particular,
γ does not bound a disk in γ ∪ Int γ).
Lemma 2.1. Let γ be a simple closed curve in X. Then the intersection of Int γ
with each face of X is open in X.
Proof. Suppose x ∈ Int γ lies on a face Xf of X. Find δ > 0 such that U :=
BX (x, δ) ⊂ Xf r γ. Let y ∈ U ; since U is homeorphic to the closed disk, we have a
deformation retraction of U r {y} to ∂U . Thus X r U is a deformation retract of
Xr{y} by the Pasting Lemma. Hence the inclusion XrU ,→ Xr{y} is a homotopy
equivalence. So we have ismorphisms H1 (X r {x}) → H1 (X r U ) → H1 (X r {y}).
Thus [γ] 6= 0 ∈ H1 (X r {x}) gives us [γ] 6= 0 ∈ H1 (X r {y}), hence y ∈ Int γ.
Therefore U ⊂ Int γ, which proves Xf ∩ Int γ is open in X.

For completeness of exposition, we now prove two simple lemmas.
Lemma 2.2. Let D be the closed unit disk in the plane, and let x ∈ ∂D. For
every open neighborhood U of x, there is an open neighborhood V ⊂ U of x, a point
z ∈ V ∩ Int D, and a deformation retraction D r {z} → ∂D such that the image of
D r V lies in ∂D r V .
Proof. Let U be an open neighborhood of x. Then there is some δ > 0 such that
V := B(x, δ) ⊂ U . Pick z ∈ V , and let f be the radial projection of D r {z} onto
∂D. By convexity of V , f −1 (V ) ⊂ V . Thus f is a deformation retraction such that
f (D r V ) ⊂ ∂D r V .

Lemma 2.3. Let α : [0, 1] → B be a topological embedding into a space B such
that α([0, 1]) r (α(0) ∪ α(1)) is open in B. Let A = α([0, 1]). Assume there is a
continuous map σ : S 1 → B of the unit circle to B, and let C = σ −1 (A). If σ|C is
a bijection onto A then [σ] 6= 0 ∈ H1 (B).

Proof. Let f : B → C/∂C be given by f |A = (σ|C ) and f (b) = ∂C for b ∈ B r A.
Let h : C/∂C → S 1 be a homeomorphism. Then h ◦ f ◦ σ is a degree ±1 map
S 1 → S 1 , hence (h ◦ f )∗ [σ] 6= 0. Therefore [σ] 6= 0.

We now extend one important feature of the Jordan Curve Theorem to X: The
interior of a simple closed curve γ in X accumulates on each point of γ. We first
prove this result for points of γ on the faces of X.
Lemma 2.4. Let γ be a simple closed curve in X, and let x be a point on γ that
lies on a face of X. Then Int γ accumulates on x.
Proof. Let r > 0 be such that BX (x, r) lies in a face of X. Let δ ∈ (0, r) be given;
we show there is some point of Int γ in BX (x, δ). Note we may assume δ is small
enough that γ * BX (x, δ). Fix δ 0 with δ < δ 0 < r.
Let p and q be the endpoints of the maximal arc α of γ in BX (x, δ) on which x lies.
By choice of r, the geodesics [x, p]X and [x, q]X uniquely extend to geodesics [x, p0 ]X
and [x, q 0 ]X , respectively, with p0 , q 0 ∈ ∂BX (x, δ 0 ). Note that (up to reparametrization) there are two arcs in ∂BX (x, δ 0 ) from q 0 to p0 ; let β1 be one and β2 the other.
Let η1 and η2 be the concatenated paths ηi = α ∗ [q, q 0 ]X ∗ βi ∗ [p0 , p]X (see Figure
2). Thus η1 and η2 are simple closed curves in BX (x, r).

Figure 2. The curve η1 = α ∗ [q, q 0 ]X ∗ β1 ∗ [p0 , p]X .
For i = 1, 2, let Ui be the bounded component of BX (x, r) r ηi guaranteed by
the Jordan Curve Theorem. Note that U1 and U2 are disjoint, and by Schoenflies,
each Ui is homeomorphic to the closed unit disk. By Lemma 2.2, we may find a
nondegenerate subarc α0 of α containing x, points zi ∈ Ui ∩ BX (x, δ), and deformation retractions of Ui r {zi } onto ηi mapping (γ r α0 ) ∩ BX (x, r) to ηi r α0 . Pasting
these deformation retractions together with the geodesic retraction (projection) of
X onto BX (x, δ 0 ), we have a deformation retraction f : X r {z1 , z2 } → η1 ∪ η2 such
that γ ∩ f −1 (α0 ) = α0 . Thus
H1 (X r {z1 , z2 })

f∗

/ H1 (η1 ∪ η2 )

is an isomorphism that maps [γ] 7→ f∗ [γ] 6= 0 by Lemma 2.3. Hence [γ] 6= 0 ∈
H1 (X r {z1 , z2 }). By Mayer-Vietoris (recall that X is contractible) we have an

isomorphism
H1 (X r {z1 , z2 })

/ H1 (X r {z1 }) ⊕ H1 (X r {z2 })

induced by inclusions, and thus [γ] 6= 0 in at least one of H1 (X r {z1 }) and H1 (X r
{z2 }). Therefore, either z1 or z2 is an element of Int γ.

We now drop the hypothesis that x lie on a face of X.
Lemma 2.5. Let γ be a simple closed curve in X. Then Int γ accumulates on
every point of γ. In fact, the points of Int γ that lie on faces of X so accumulate.
Proof. Let x ∈ γ, and let δ > 0 be given. We will show that there is some point of
Int γ in BX (x, δ). If some y ∈ γ ∩ BX (x, δ) lies on a face of X, Lemma 2.4 gives us
a point of Int γ in BX (x, δ). So suppose γ ∩ BX (x, δ) lies in the 1-skeleton of X.
Then there is a y ∈ γ ∩ BX (x, δ) that lies on an edge of X, and a δ 0 ∈ (0, d(x, y))
such that BX (y, δ 0 ) contains no vertices of X but γ ∩BX (y, δ 0 ) is a geodesic segment
along the edge.
For each face Xf of X that touches the edge, choose a point yf ∈ Xf such
that 21 δ 0 < d(yf , y) < δ 0 . Let P be the set of all points yf . Since B X (y, δ 0 ) r P
deformation retracts onto ∂BX (y, δ 0 )∪(γ ∩ BX (y, δ 0 )), by Lemma 2.3 we have [γ] 6=
0 ∈ H1 (X rP ). Now P is discrete and closed by construction, and X is contractible
and locally contractible, so the inclusions X r P → X r {p} induce an isomorphism
H∗ (X r P )

H∗ (X r {p}).

Thus one of the points yf must lie in Int γ.



Our next goal is to prove a replacement property for openness of the interior
Int γ of a simple closed curve γ in X, to use when not on a face of X. We prove
Int γ has the geodesic extension property, in a local sense.
Lemma 2.6. Let γ be a simple closed curve in X. Then Int γ locally extends
geodesics; that is, every geodesic [p, q]X ⊂ Int γ extends to a geodesic [p, q 0 ]X ⊂ Int γ
with [p, q]X ⊂ [p, q 0 ]X .
Proof. Let [p, q]X ⊂ Int γ be a geodesic in X. Find  > 0 such that D := BX (q, )
is a conical neighborhood of q, and γ ⊂ X r D. Now D r {q} deformation retracts
onto ∂D, and X deformation retracts onto D via geodesic projection, so pasting
together gives a deformation retraction f : X r {q} → ∂D.
Let C = {y ∈ ∂D : ∠q (p, y) < π}. Since X is locally finite, the topological
boundary P = ∂C in ∂D is finite, so ∂D r P is a disjoint union of metric graphs.
By the link condition on X [1, p. 206], the component C of ∂D r P is contractible,
and there is a lower bound on the length of circles in ∂D; hence there exists a finite
set Q ⊂ ∂D r C such that ∂D r Q is a disjoint union of trees. The long exact
sequence

that each y ∈ Vy . Then we have a commutative diagram

Since the maps f∗ and Φ are both injective, and [γ] 6= 0 ∈ H1 (∂D), there must be
some q 0 ∈ Q such that (φ ◦ f∗ )([γ]) 6= 0, where
/ H1 (∂D, ∂D r {q 0 })

φ : H1 (∂D)

is the associated component function of Φ. (Hence by naturality of the long exact
sequence, φ is the map in the long exact sequence of the pair (∂D, ∂D r {q 0 }).)
Since q 0 ∈ ∂D r C, we have ∠q (p, q 0 ) = π, and therefore [q, q 0 ]X extends the
geodesic segment [p, q]X to [p, q 0 ]X . Thus it remains only to show [q, q 0 ]X ⊂ Int γ.
Define W ⊂ D and U ⊂ ∂D as follows. If q 0 lies on a face of X, then let F be the
open face containing q 0 , and let W = F ∩ D and U = F ∩ ∂D. On the other hand,
if q 0 lies on an edge of X, then let G = [q, q 0 ]X , let F be the union of all open faces
containing q 0 in their closure, and let W = (F ∪ G) ∩ D and U = (F ∪ G) ∩ ∂D. Now
let x ∈ [q, q 0 ]X r {q, q 0 } be arbitrary. By construction, W is a conical neighborhood
of q 0 in X, so we have a deformation retraction g : X r {x} → ∂W . Also, ∂W r {q 0 }
deformation retracts onto ∂W r U , which deformation retracts onto {q}, being a
cone over q. Thus ∂W r {q 0 } is contractible, so the long exact sequence gives us

commutes, and thus q ∈ Int γ implies x ∈ Int γ for all x ∈ [q, q 0 ]X r {q, q 0 }. By
compactness of γ ∪ Int γ, we obtain q 0 ∈ Int γ, and the theorem is proved.

Thus we can extend another feature of the Jordan Curve Theorem to X.
Corollary 2.7. Let γ be a simple closed curve in X. Then Int γ extends geodesics
to γ—that is, every geodesic [p, q]X ⊂ Int γ extends to a geodesic [p, q 0 ]X ⊂ γ ∪ Int γ
with [p, q]X ⊂ [p, q 0 ]X , q 0 ∈ γ, and [p, q 0 ]X r {q 0 } ⊂ Int γ.
Proof. Let a0 = sup {d(p, q 0 ) : q 0 ∈ X such that [p, q]X ⊂ [p, q 0 ]X ⊂ γ ∪ Int γ}. By
compactness of γ ∪ Int γ, there is some q 0 ∈ γ ∪ Int γ such that dX (p, q 0 ) = a0 and
[p, q]X ⊂ [p, q 0 ]X ⊂ γ ∪ Int γ. By Lemma 2.6, q 0 ∈
/ Int γ; hence q 0 ∈ γ.
0
Now, it is conceivable that q is not the only point of γ on [p, q 0 ]X . If so, by
compactness of γ we may find the closest point q 00 to p on [p, q 0 ]X ∩ γ. Then the
conclusion of the lemma holds with q 00 in place of q 0 .

Combining Lemma 2.5 and Corollary 2.7, we obtain the following theorem.
Theorem 2.8 (“The Curve Theorem”). Let γ be a simple closed curve in X. Then
Int γ accumulates on every point of γ. Moreover, Int γ extends geodesics to γ.
3. Detecting intrinsic geodesics
Let E be a fixed closed, rectifiably-connected subspace of X with the induced
subspace metric (also written d), such that H1 (E) = 0. Let Y be the space E,
endowed with the induced path metric, dY .
Lemma 3.1. Let Z be a complete, rectifiably-connected metric space. Then Z, with
the induced path metric, is complete and geodesic.
Proof. This is proved in Lemma 2.1 and Corollary 2.2 of [3].



Of course this implies Y is complete and geodesic.
Lemma 3.2. If the geodesic [x, y]X in X between x and y satisfies [x, y]X ⊂ E,
then [x, y]X is the unique geodesic in Y between x and y.
Proof. This result is immediate from the definitions.



Lemma 3.3. Let γ be a simple closed curve in E, and α be a subarc of γ that is
geodesic in Y . If x, y ∈ α such that [x, y]X lies in γ ∪ Int γ, then [x, y]X ⊂ α.
Proof. Since H1 (E) = 0, we know Int γ ⊂ E. Apply Lemma 3.2.

Lemma 3.4. Let C be a closed convex subspace of X and γ be a simple closed
curve in E. Define distC : X → R by distC (p) = d(p, C). Let p be a point on γ
where distC attains its maximum on γ but is not locally constant on γ. Then γ is
not locally geodesic in Y at the point p.
Proof. Suppose, by way of contradiction, that V is a conical neighborhood of p in
X such that γ ∩ V is geodesic. By Lemma 2.5, there is a sequence pk → p in X such
that each pk lies on a face of X and pk ∈ Int γ. For each pk , let rk ∈ C be the closest
point to pk in C, and let x0k , yk0 be points of X r{pk } such that the Alexandrov angle
π
X
0
X
0

0
in X satisfies ∠X
pk (xk , rk ) = 2 = ∠pk (yk , rk ) and ∠pk (xk , yk ) = π. By Lemma 2.1,
we may assume x0k , yk0 are near enough to pk that the geodesic [x0k , yk0 ]X in X satisfies
[x0k , yk0 ]X ⊂ Int γ. By Corollary 2.7, we can extend [x0k , yk0 ]X to a geodesic [xk , yk ]X
in X such that [xk , yk ]X ⊂ γ ∪Int γ and xk , yk ∈ γ. Taking the limit of the geodesics
[xk , yk ]X in X as k → ∞, we obtain a (possibly degenerate) geodesic [x, y]X in X;
by compactness, [x, y]X ⊂ γ ∪ Int γ and x, y ∈ γ. Since each pk ∈ [xk , yk ]X , we also
see that p ∈ [x, y]X .
We consider three cases for x and y. Case 1: x = p = y. Then eventually
xk , yk ∈ V ∩ γ, contradicting Lemma 3.3. Case 2: x 6= p and y 6= p. Then γ locally
follows the geodesic [x, y]X in X. But now p cannot be a local maximum for distC
without forcing distC to be locally constant at p because distC is convex in the
CAT(0) space X. So Cases 1 and 2 are impossible.
Finally, Case 3: Exactly one of x, y equals p. We may assume x 6= p and y = p.
Choose w, q ∈ [x, p]X r {x, p} such that the geodesic [w, p]X in X extends the
geodesic [w, q]X in X. By Lemma 2.5, there is a sequence qk → q in X such that
each qk lies on a face of X and qk ∈ Int γ. Note that [w, qk ]X r {w} ⊂ Int γ for
all sufficiently large k ∈ N because V is a conical neighborhood of p in X. By
Corollary 2.7, we may extend each geodesic [w, qk ]X in X to a geodesic [w, zk ]X
in X such that zk ∈ γ and [w, zk ]X r {w, zk } ⊂ Int γ. Passing to a subsequence
if necessary, we may assume (zk ) converges in X to some point z ∈ γ. Notice
p ∈ [x, z]X by simpleness of γ. Since [x, z]X ⊂ γ ∪ Int γ by compactness, if p 6= z
then γ is locally geodesic in X at p, and we obtain a contradiction as in Case 2
above; on the other hand, if p = z then eventually zk , w ∈ V ∩ γ, contradicting
Lemma 3.3 as in Case 1 above. Thus in every case, we obtain a contradiction. The
statement of the lemma follows.

Corollary 3.5. Y is uniquely geodesic.
Proof. Suppose, by way of contradiction, that σ and τ are distinct geodesics in
Y from x ∈ Y to y ∈ Y . We may assume σ and τ intersect only at x and y.
Put C = [x, y]X and γ = σ ∪ τ . By Lemma 3.4, one of σ and τ is not locally
geodesic at some point (away from x and y), contradicting our hypothesis on σ and
τ . Therefore, Y is uniquely geodesic.

4. Bootstrapping the planar case
In the proof of [3, Theorem B], the essential construction is that of two unique
(though not necessarily distinct) geodesic segments we call “limit segments,” based
at a given vertex, p, of a simple geodesic triangle T , with two important features:
(1) The limit segments extend through T ∪ Int T to the opposite side of T .
(2) The angle between the limit segments equals the Alexandrov angle of the
triangle at p (this is the content of [3, Theorem B]).

We will follow the same general outline, creating limit segments and proving that
the angle between them equals the Alexandrov angle of the triangle at the vertex.
The first part of the proof is to reduce to the case where [3, Theorem B] applies.
We begin with some terminology.
Definition 4.1. A geodesic triangle T in Y is called simple if it is a simple closed
curve in Y (or, equivalently, in X).
Definition 4.2. Let p and q be distinct points in Y , and let σ : [0, 1] → Y be a
constant-speed geodesic with σ(0) = p and σ(1) = q. Let  > 0 be small enough
that BX (p, 2) is a conical neighborhood of p in X. For t ∈ (0, 1], let Rq,t be the
geodesic from p through σ(t) in X of length . If the geodesics Rq,t limit uniformly
onto a geodesic Rq in X, we call Rq the limit segment of σ at p (of length ).
Since we will be talking about angles in both X and Y , we will distinguish
between them by placing the space as a superscript, as follows.
Definition 4.3. Let Z be a metric space. We will write ∠Z
p (q, r) for the Alexandrov
(κ),Z

angle ∠p (q, r) in Z and ∠p

(κ)

(q, r) for the Mκ2 -comparison angle ∠p (q, r) in Z.

We restate [3, Theorem B] in the current context.
Theorem 4.4 (Theorem B of [3]). Assume X = Mκ2 and E is simply connected.
Let T be a simple geodesic triangle in Y with vertices p, q, and r. For all sufficiently
small  > 0, both limit segments Rq and Rr of T exist at p, both Rq and Rr lie
completely in T ∪ Int T , and


∠Yp (q, r) = ∠X
p (Rq , Rr ).

We would like to use this theorem to prove the general case, but first we have to
properly transfer the setting.
Lemma 4.5. Let C be a closed, convex subspace of X. Let A be a path-connected
metric subspace of E, and let B be the union of all geodesics [x, y]Y in Y between
all points x, y ∈ A, taken as a metric subspace of E. If A ⊂ C, then B ⊂ C.
Proof. First suppose, by way of contradiction, that A ⊂ C but there is a point
z ∈ B r C. By definition of B, we know z lies on a geodesic [x, y]Y in Y for some
x, y ∈ A. We may assume that [x, y]Y ∩ C = {x, y}. Since A is path connected, we
may find a path in A ⊂ C ∩ E joining x and y; we may of course assume this path
is injective. Concatenating this path with the geodesic [x, y]Y , we obtain a simple
closed curve in E. By Lemma 3.4, [x, y]Y must stay in C or it cannot be a geodesic
in Y ; this contradicts our choice of [x, y]Y . Therefore, we must have B ⊂ C.

Lemma 4.6. Let D be a closed, convex subspace of X which isometrically embeds
in Mκ2 . Let T be a simple geodesic triangle in Y with vertices p, q, r ∈ D. Then
T ∪ Int T ⊂ D ∩ E and is compact, simply connected, and rectifiably connected as a
subspace of D, and convex as a subspace of Y .
Proof. Let C be the convex hull of {p, q, r} in X; note that C is closed. By
Lemma 3.4, T must lie in C. Now C, as a convex subspace of a CAT(0) space, is
contractible. Therefore, there is a singular 2-chain in C with boundary T ; hence
T ∪ Int T , being the intersection of all singular 2-chains with boundary T , must lie
in C. Thus T ∪ Int T ⊂ C ⊂ D. Let ϕ : D → Mκ2 be an isometric embedding. Note
that ϕ(C) is the convex hull of {ϕ(p), ϕ(q), ϕ(r)} in Mκ2 , and ϕ(Int T ) = Int ϕ(T ) is

the interior of ϕ(T ) guaranteed by the Jordan Curve Theorem in Mκ2 . In particular,
T ∪ Int T , as a metric subspace of X, is topologically a closed disk by Schoenflies.
Let F0 = T ∪ Int T as a metric subspace of X. Since H1 (E) = 0, we know
Int T ⊂ E and therefore F0 ⊂ E. Let Z0 = F0 as a metric subspace of Y . Let
Z1 be the union of all geodesics [x, y]Y in Y between all points x, y ∈ Z0 , with Z1
taken as a metric subspace of Y . Let F1 = Z1 as a metric subspace of X. Since F0
is topologically a closed disk, F0 is path connected. Thus F1 ⊂ C by Lemma 4.5.
But now F0 ⊂ F1 ⊂ C ⊂ D. Since C is the convex hull of the vertices of T
in a disk of Mκ2 , no geodesic [x, y]Y in Y can stay in C and yet leave F0 without
violating the hypothesis that the sides of T are geodesics in Y . Thus F1 = F0 , i.e. Z0
is convex. This implies F0 is rectifiably connected, and the lemma is proved.

The next lemma gives some surprising teeth to Lemma 4.6.
Lemma 4.7. Let p ∈ Y , and let V be a conical neighborhood of p in X. Every
simple geodesic triangle in Y with one vertex p and other two vertices q, r ∈ V lies
inside a closed, convex subspace C of X that isometrically embeds in Mκ2 .
Proof. Let q, r be points of E ∩ V such that the geodesic triangle T in Y with
vertices p, q, r is simple. Let C be the convex hull of {p, q, r} in X; note that C
is closed and C ⊂ V . By Lemma 3.4, T must lie in C. Now if ∠X
p (q, r) = π,
then C is the geodesic [q, r]X in X; however, this means T ⊂ C cannot be simple,
contradicting our hypothesis. Thus ∠X
p (q, r) < π.
Let ρ be radial projection in X r {p} to the link of p in X, and let G be the
geodesic in the link between ρ(q) and ρ(r). Let D = (ρ−1 (G) ∩ V ) ∪ {p}. Since V
is a conical neighborhood about p, it follows that D is convex. Thus C ⊂ D; since
D isometrically embeds in Mκ2 , so does C.

Corollary 4.8. Let p ∈ Y , and let V be a conical neighborhood of p in X. Let T
be a simple geodesic triangle in Y with one vertex p and other two vertices q, r ∈ V .
There exists  > 0 such that both limit segments Rq and Rr of T exist at p, both

We began this section by mentioning two important features that held in the
planar case, which we wanted to extend to the general case. We can now prove
existence of limit segments in the general case, along with Feature 2.
Theorem 4.9. Let T be a simple geodesic triangle in Y with vertices p, q, and r.
For all  > 0 small enough, both limit segments Rq and Rr of T exist at p, and


∠Yp (q, r) = ∠X
p (Rq , Rr ).

Proof. Let V be a conical neighborhood about p in X. Since the existence of limit
segments of T at p is local, and Y uniquely geodesic, we may assume q, r ∈ V . The
theorem follows from Corollary 4.8.

5. Extending limit segments
We now turn to proving Feature 1 of the limit segments in the general case. We
begin with a result about variations of geodesics in Y .

Lemma 5.1. Let pk → p and qk → q in Y . For each k ∈ N let σk : [0, 1] → Y be the
constant-speed parametrization of the geodesic in Y from pk to qk . Then the maps
σk converge uniformly in X to the constant-speed parametrization σ : [0, 1] → Y of
the geodesic in Y from p to q.
Proof. Let ι : Y → E be the setwise identity map, ι(y) = y ∈ E for all y ∈ Y . For
each k ∈ N let σkE = ι ◦ σk , and note that σkE : [0, 1] → E is dY (pk , qk )-Lipschitz.
Since pk → p and qk → q in Y , we know dY (pk , qk ) → dY (p, q). Since E is proper, by
the Arzelà-Ascoli Theorem the maps σkE have a uniform limit σ E : [0, 1] → E, which
is dY (p, q)-Lipschitz. By uniqueness of geodesics in Y , we must have σ E = ι◦σ. 
Remark. If the uniform convergence in Lemma 5.1 was in Y instead of in X, then
we could say geodesics in Y vary continuously in their endpoints.
Corollary 5.2. Let ι : Y → E be the setwise identity map, ι(y) = y ∈ E for all
y ∈ Y . Let τ0 , τ1 : [0, 1] → Y be two continuous paths in Y , and for each s ∈ [0, 1]
let σs : [0, 1] → Y be constant-speed parametrization of the (possibly degenerate)
geodesic [τ0 (s), τ1 (s)]Y in Y from τ0 (s) to τ1 (s). Then the map f : [0, 1]×[0, 1] → E
defined by setting f (s, t) = ι(σs (t)) for all s, t ∈ [0, 1] is continuous in X.
Thus a variation of geodesics in Y is a homotopy in E ⊂ X (see Figure 3).

Figure 3. A variation of geodesics in Y gives a homotopy in E
(as a subset of X), by Corollary 5.2.
This homotopy allows us to compare interiors of two related triangles (a similar
statement for generic simple closed curves in Y would be false).
Lemma 5.3. Let T be a simple geodesic triangle in Y with vertices p, q, r. Let
Tb be a simple geodesic triangle in Y with vertices p, q 0 , r0 , where q 0 ∈ [p, q]Y and
r0 ∈ [p, r]Y . There is some  > 0 such that Int T ∩ BX (p, ) = Int Tb ∩ BX (p, ).
Proof. Let P ⊂ Y be the broken-geodesic path P = [q 0 , q]Y ∪ [q, r]Y ∪ [r, r0 ]Y
in Y , and Q ⊂ Y the quadrilateral Q = P ∪ [r0 , q 0 ]Y . Let G be the geodesic
[q, r]X between q and r in X. By Lemma 3.4, p globally maximizes distG (the
distance in X to G) among points of T . Hence by compactness, there is some
 > 0 such that distG (x) ≤ distG (p) −  for all x ∈ P . Let C ⊂ X be the closed,
convex subspace C = {x ∈ X : d(x, G) ≤ }. Then P ⊂ C, and by Lemma 4.5,
Q ⊂ C. Corollary 5.2 guarantees a nulhomotopy of Q in E. Applying Lemma 4.5
again, we see that this nulhomotopy lies completely in C. Therefore, T and Tb are
homotopic in E by a homotopy that is constant on X rC ⊃ BX (p, ). In particular,
Int T ∩ BX (p, ) = Int Tb ∩ BX (p, ).

Lemma 5.4. Let T be a simple geodesic triangle in Y with vertices p, q, r. For
small enough  > 0, both limit segments Rq and Rr of T at p lie completely in
T ∪ Int T .

lemma.

Lemma 5.5. Let T be a simple geodesic triangle in Y with vertices p, q, r. For
small enough  > 0, the limit segment Rq of T at p can be extended to a geodesic
in X from p to q 0 ∈ [q, r]Y ⊂ T , with [p, q 0 ]X ⊂ T ∪ Int T . Similarly, the limit
segment Rr can be extended to a geodesic in X from p to r0 ∈ [q, r]Y ⊂ T , with
[p, r0 ]X ⊂ T ∪ Int T .
Proof. Choose  > 0 small enough that both limit segments Rq and Rr of T at p
lie completely in T ∪ Int T (possible by Lemma 5.4). If Rq enters Int T , then by
Lemma 2.7 we can extend Rq to a geodesic [p, q 0 ]X in X that lies completely in
T ∪ Int T with q 0 ∈ T ; by Lemma 3.3, q 0 ∈ [q, r]Y , as desired. So assume Rq ⊂ T .
Assume first that Rq ⊂ [p, q]Y . We may assume Rq and Rr lie in a conical
neighborhood V of p in X. Let w be the midpoint of Rq ; by Lemma 2.5, we
may find be a sequence of points wk ∈ Int T such that wk → w in X and each
wk lies on a face of X. For each k ∈ N, let [pk , wk ]X be the maximal subarc of
the geodesic [p, wk ]X in X between p and wk such that [pk , wk ]X r {pk } ⊂ Int T .
By Lemma 2.7, we can extend [pk , wk ]X to a geodesic [pk , xk ]X in X such that
xk ∈ T and [pk , xk ]X r {pk , xk } ⊂ Int T . Because p and w lie in the conical
neighborhood V , for all sufficiently large k we find [p, xk ]X r {p} lies on a face of
X, and thus pk ∈ T . Since T is simple and [p, q]Y follows Rq , which is a geodesic in
X with one endpoint p and midpoint w, we see that eventually every pk ∈ [p, r]Y
(possibly pk = p) and pk → p. Since wk ∈ Int T lies on [pk , xk ]X , by Lemma 3.3
we must have xk ∈ [p, q]Y or xk ∈ [q, r]Y . In the first case, we have a new simple
geodesic triangle in Y with vertices p, pk , xk formed by concatenating the geodesics
[p, pk ]Y ⊂ [p, r]Y ⊂ T , [pk , xk ]X ⊂ E, and [xk , p]Y ⊂ [q, p]Y ⊂ T . But this simple
geodesic triangle has all its vertices along the (closed, convex) geodesic [p, xk ]X in
X; by Lemma 3.4 the whole triangle must lie in [p, xk ]X , making it degenerate and
therefore not simple. Thus only the second case is possible: xk ∈ [q, r]Y . Taking
the limit of geodesics [pk , xk ]X in X as k → ∞, we obtain a geodesic [p, x]X in
X; by compactness, x ∈ [q, r]Y and [p, x]X ⊂ T ∪ Int T . Thus we have proved the
lemma in this case, too.
Finally, assume that Rq is not a subset of [p, q]Y . Since Rq ⊂ T , we must have

Rq ⊂ [p, r]Y . But then Rr = Rq ⊂ [p, r]Y . So, swapping the roles of q and r in the
previous paragraph, we can extend Rr = Rq in T ∪ Int T to [q, r]Y , as desired.
The proof for the limit segment Rr is completely similar.

6. Curvature
We finally arrive at the main result of the paper.
Theorem 6.1. Let E be a closed, rectifiably-connected subspace of a locally-finite
CAT(κ) Mκ -polyhedral 2-complex X, where κ ≤ 0. If H1 (E) = 0 then E, under
the induced path metric, is a complete CAT(κ) space.
Proof. Let Y be the space E, with the induced path metric. We want to show
(κ),Y
that ∠Yp (q, r) ≤ ∠p
(q, r) for every triple of distinct points p, q, r ∈ E. So let
T be a geodesic triangle in Y with distinct vertices p, q, r ∈ E. If T is not simple
in a neighborhood of p in X, then by uniqueness of geodesics, either p lies on the
geodesic [q, r]Y in Y or both geodesics [p, q]Y and [p, r]Y in Y must coincide for some
(κ),Y
distance from p. In the first case, T is degenerate with ∠Yp (q, r) = ∠p
(q, r) = π.
(κ),Y

(q, r). Thus we may assume T is simple in a
In the second, ∠Yp (q, r) = 0 ≤ ∠p
neighborhood U of p.
Let [q, q 0 ]Y be the maximal subarc (possibly degenerate) of the geodesic [q, r]Y
in Y such that [q, q 0 ]Y coincides with the geodesic [q, p]Y ⊂ T in Y from q to
p. The geodesic triangle in Y with vertices p, q, q 0 is therefore degenerate with
(κ),Y
(q, q 0 ) = 0. By Alexandrov’s Lemma [1, Lemma II.4.10], it
∠Yp (q, q 0 ) = ∠p
suffices to prove the theorem when q = q 0 . Similarly, we may assume the geodesics
[r, q]Y and [r, p]Y in Y do not coincide near r. Thus we may assume T is simple.
By Theorem 4.9 and Lemma 5.5, we have a geodesic [p, q 00 ]X in X from p to
00
q ∈ [q, r]Y such that [p, q 00 ]X ⊂ T ∪ Int T . The geodesic triangle in Y with vertices
p, q, q 00 is either simple, in which case the equation in Theorem 4.9 applies, or both
edges of the triangle from p coincide for some positive distance out from p; in either
(κ),Y
(q, q 00 ). By Alexandrov’s Lemma [1, Lemma II.4.10],
case, ∠Yp (q, q 00 ) = 0 ≤ ∠p
it suffices to consider the case q = q 00 . A similar argument holds for r in place of q.
Thus we may assume both geodesics [p, q]Y and [p, r]Y in Y lie completely in X.
Now d(p, q 0 ) = dY (p, q 0 ) and d(p, r0 ) = dY (p, r0 ). And since d(q 0 , r0 ) ≤ dY (q 0 , r0 ),
we see directly that
0 0
(κ),X 0 0
∠Yp (q 0 , r0 ) = ∠X
(q , r ) ≤ ∠p(κ),Y (q 0 , r0 ).
p (q , r ) ≤ ∠p

0 0
(q 0 , r0 ) by the CAT(κ) inequality.) Thus Y is CAT(κ).
(Recall ∠X
p (q , r ) ≤ ∠p
Completeness comes from Lemma 3.1.
