Abstract
In this paper we consider actions of the free group on two generators. We prove that an action of this group on a compact manifold
of dimension greater or equal to two that is C 0 -stable must have the
shadowing property. We also construct both a C 0 and a C 1 -stable
action on S 1 .

Introduction.

Given a topological group G and a metric space (X, d), a dynamical system is
formally defined as a triplet (G, X, Φ), where Φ : G× X → X is a continuous
function with Φ(g1 , Φ(g2 , x)) = Φ(g1 g2 , x) for all g1 , g2 ∈ G and for all x ∈ X.
The map Φ is called an action of G on X. It is possible to associate to each
element of g ∈ G a homeomorphism Φg : X → X where Φg (x) = Φ(g, x).
For every x ∈ X we define the orbit of x as O(x) = {Φg (x) : g ∈ G}. A
non-empty set M ⊂ X is called minimal for the action if O(x) = M for any
x ∈ M.
A group G is finitely generated if there exists a finite set S ⊂ G such that
for any g ∈ G there exist s1 , ..., sn ∈ S with g = s1 . · · · .sn . The set S is
called a finite generator of G. If S is a finite generator of G and for all s ∈ S
we have that s−1 ∈ S, then the set S is called a finite symmetric generator.
For usual dynamical systems, that is when the group is ZZ and the action is
Φ(n, x) = f n (x), we say that a sequence {xn } is δ-pseudotrajectory if
d(f (xn ), xn+1 ) < δ, ∀n ∈ Z.
It is possible to generalize this concept to dynamical systems (G, X, Φ) as
introduced in [OT]: A G-sequence in X is a function F : G → X. We denote
1

this function by {xg } where F (g) = xg . Let S be a finite symmetric generator
of G. For δ > 0 we say that a G-sequence {xg } is a δ-pseudotrajectory if
d(Φs (xg ), xsg ) < δ, ∀g ∈ G and ∀s ∈ S.
Given a dynamical system (G, X, Φ), we say that Φ has the shadowing property if for any ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that for any δpseudotrajectory {xg } there exists a point y ∈ X with
d(xg , Φg (y)) < ε, ∀g ∈ G.
A finite symmetric generator S of G is uniformly continuous if for every
ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that d(x, y) < δ implies d(Φs (x), Φs (y)) < ε for
every s ∈ S. It was proved in [OT, Proposition 1] that the shadowing property does not depend on the finite symmetric generator S if it is uniformly
continuous.
In the case of homeomorphism and diffeomorphisms (G = ZZ) there is
a strong relationship between stability and the shadowing property. An
homeomorphism f : X → X is C 0 -stable if for every ε > 0, there exists
δ > 0 such that if g is another homeomorphism on X with dC 0 (f, g) :=
supx∈X {d(f (x), g(x)} < δ then there exists a continuous and surjective
function h : X → X with hg = f h and dC 0 (h, id) < ε. When X is
a manifold and f : X → X is a diffeomorphism, we say that f is C 1 stable if there exists δ > 0 such that g is another diffeomorphism with
dC 1 (f, g) := M ax{dC 0 (f, g), dC 0 (Df, Dg)} < δ, then there exists a homeomorphisms h : M → M with hg = f h. In [W] was proved that every
C 0 -stable homeomorphism in a compact manifold of dimension greater or
equal to two, has the shadowing property. This property is also valid for
C 1 -stable diffeomorphisms. The concepts of C 0 and C 1 stability can by generalized for actions as follows: let S be a finite generating set for a group G.
We denote by Act(G, X) the set of actions in X, and we define a metric d0S
on Act(G, X) by
e Φ) := M axs∈S {dC 0 (Φ
e s , Φs )}, for Φ,
e Φ ∈ Act(G, X).
d0S (Φ,

We say that an action Φ ∈ Act(G, X) is C 0 - stable if for every ε > 0, there
e ∈ Act(G, X) with d0 (Φ,
e Φ) < δ then there exists
exists δ > 0 such that if Φ
S
e g = Φg h, for every
a continuous and surjective function h : X → X, with hΦ
g ∈ G and dC 0 (h, id) < ε. It is not hard to prove that this definition does
not depend on the generator S if X is a compact set (see [CL, Lemma 2.2]).
When X is a manifold M , let C 1 (M ) be the set of C 1 maps f : M → M .
Let S be a finite generator of G. Let
Act1 (G, M ) = {Φ ∈ Act(G, M ) : Φs ∈ C 1 (M ) for all s ∈ S}.

We denote by F2 the free group generated by two elements. Let us state our
main result:
Theorem A Let (F2 , M, Φ) be a dynamical system with M a compact manifold of dimension greater or equal to two. If Φ is C 0 -stable then Φ has the
shadowing property.
An action Φ ∈ Act(G, X) is expansive if there exist α > 0 such that for
every x, y ∈ X with x 6= y there exists g ∈ G such that d(Φg (x), Φg (y)) > α.
Let X be a compact metric space. In [CL] was proved that if the action
Φ ∈ Act(G, X) is expansive and has the shadowing property then Φ is C 0 stable. In section 2, we construct a C 0 and C 1 -stable action of G = F2 on
S 1 that is not expansive. This shows that the expansive property is not a
necessary condition for the stability.

Example of a C 0 and C 1-stable action.

In this section, we consider the free group F2 with finite symmetric generator
S = {a, a−1 , b, b−1 }. We are going to construct a C 0 and C 1 -stable action Φ
in S 2 whose minimal set K is a Cantor set. The generator of the action will
be Φa and Φb where Φa , Φb : S 2 → S 2 will be defined later.
We begin defining a function fa : [0, +∞] → [0, +∞], fa ∈ C 1 , as figure

1. Considerer the intervals Ja y Ja−1 = fa−1 (Ja ) such that (see figure 1):
1. |fa−1 (x)−fa−1 (y)| > 2|x−y| for all x, y ∈ Ja (and consequently |fa (x)−
fa (y)| < 1/2|x − y| for all x, y ∈ Ja ).
2. |fa−1 (x) − fa−1 (y)| < 1/2|x − y| for all x, y ∈ Ja−1 .
Now we defining Φa : S 2 → S 2 (in polar coordinates) and the intervals
Ia y Ia−1 such that
• Φa (r, θ) = (fa (r), θ).
• Ia = {(r, θ) : r ∈ Ja and θ ∈ [0, 2π)} and Ia−1 = {(r, θ) :
Ja−1 and θ ∈ [0, 2π)}

It is clear that Φa : S 2 → S 2 is a north-south pole diffeomorphism, with
Ω(Φa ) = {Na , Sa }, ( Sa ∈ Ia , Na ∈ Ia−1 ) and verifies
−1
• ||Φ−1
a (x) − Φa (y)|| > 2||x − y|| for all x, y ∈ Ia (and consequently
||Φa (x) − Φa (y)|| < 1/2||x − y|| for all x, y ∈ Ia ).
−1
• ||Φ−1
a (x) − Φa (y)|| < 1/2||x − y|| for all x, y ∈ Ia−1 .

Now we consider Φb : S 2 → S 2 north-south pole diffeomorphism, with
Ω(Φb ) = {Nb , Sb } defined analogously to Φa . Note that it is possible to
construct Φa and Φb so that they verify the following properties:
1. I a ∩ I s = ∅, for s ∈ {b, b−1 } and I a−1 ∩ I s = ∅, for s ∈ {b, b−1 }
2. ||Φa (x) − Φa (y)|| < 1/2||x − y|| for all x, y ∈ Ib ∪ Ib−1 .
−1
3. ||Φ−1
a (x) − Φa (y)|| < 1/2||x − y|| for all x, y ∈ Ib ∪ Ib−1 .

4. ||Φb (x) − Φb (y)|| < 1/2||x − y|| for all x, y ∈ Ia ∪ Ia−1 .
−1
5. ||Φ−1
b (x) − Φb (y)|| < 1/2||x − y|| for all x, y ∈ Ia ∪ Ia−1 .

Let Φ be the action generated for Φa and Φb . The figure 2 shows the
dynamic of the action of Φ on the intervals Ia , Ia−1 , Ib and Ib−1 .
The following properties are very useful for our purpose. Since they are
not hard to prove we omit its proof.

Some of our proofs are by induction in the length of the elements g ∈ G.
Thus we need to define the length of an element g ∈ G. The elements of
length one are a, a−1 , b and b−1 . The elements of length n are obtained from
the elements of length n − 1 as follows: Let g = sn−1 ....s1 be an element
of lengths n − 1 with sj ∈ {a, a−1 , b, b−1 }. Then the elements of length n
′
generated by g are g = s.g with s 6= (sn−1 )−1 . The length of g is denoted by
|g|. It is clear that an element g ∈ G can be written from S in different ways,
for example g = gaa−1 . Note that if g = sn ....s1 with sj ∈ {a, a−1 , b, b−1 },
then |g| ≤ n. We say that g = sn ....s1 is written in its normal form if |g| = n.
It is easy to prove that the normal representation is unique. From now on
we will consider g ∈ G written in its normal form.

{yn }, {zn } be with yn , zn → x and h(yn ) → y, h(zn ) → z. Note that
y, z ∈ X1 \ X1 because h is a homeomorphisms. As y 6= z there exists Φg such that d(Φg (y), Φg (z)) > α. So, for n big enough you have

Now, by the Lemma 2.5 we can extend h to ∂K ec .

To finish, it is necessary to extend h to KΦe . Let I be a connected
component of KΦe . Let x, y ∈ ∂I ⊂ ∂K ec . Note that the map h is defined in

h(y) are in K, then there exists g ∈ G such that d(Φg (h(x)), Φg (h(y))) > α.

C 0-stability implies shadowing property.

Here we will considerer the dynamical system (F2 , M, Φ) where M is a compact manifold of dimension greater or equal two.

10

Recall that given g ∈ F2 we denoted by |g| the length of g.
Given δ > 0 and n ∈ N , we say that {xg }|g|≤n , xg ∈ M , is a δ − n pseudotrajectory if d(xsg , Φs (xg )) < δ for all s ∈ {a, a−1 , b, b−1 }, for all g ∈ F2 with
|g| ≤ n.
Lemma 4.1 If for all ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that if for all n ∈ N
and for all {xg }|g|≤n δ − n, pseudotrajectory there exists y ∈ M such that
d(Φg (y), xg ) < ε, |g| ≤ n, then Φ has the shadowing property.
Proof:
Given ε, choose δ as in the statement of the lemma. Let {xg } be a δ
pseudotrajectory. For any n ∈ N we consider {xg }|g|≤n , that is a δ − n
pseudotrajectory included in {xg }. By hypotheses, there exist yn such that
d(Φg (yn ), xg ) < ε for |g| ≤ n.
Let {ynk } be a subsequence of {yn } such that ynk → y. Given g ∈ F2 let
nk be such that |g| ≤ nk and d(Φg (y), Φg (ynk )) < ε.
Then d(Φg (y), xg ) ≤ d(Φg (y), Φg (ynk )) + d(Φg (ynk ), xg ) < 2ε. And the
proof is finished.
For the proof of the next lemma see [NS, Lemma 13].
Lemma 4.2 Let M be a compact manifold of dimension greater than or
equal to two. Suppose a finite collection {(pi , qi ) ∈ M × M for i = 1, ..., r} is
specified together with a small λ > 0 such that
1. d(pi , qi ) < λ for all i, and
2. if i 6= j then pi 6= pj and qi 6= qj .
Then there exists a diffeomorphism f : M → M such that
(a) d(f, id) < 2πλ, and
(b) f (pi ) = qi (1 ≤ i ≤ r).
Lemma 4.3 If the action Φ is C 0 -stable then the map Φa−1 Φb is C 0 -stable.
Proof: Let f be C 0 -close to Φa−1 Φb . So Φa f is C 0 -close to Φb . We conside generated by Φa and Φa f . As Φ is C 0 -stable, there exists
erer the action Φ
a semiconjugacy h such that : hΦa = Φa h and hΦa f = Φb h. Therefore
Φa hf = Φb h and hf = Φa−1 Φb h.
Remark 5 As the map Φa−1 Φb is C 0 -stable there is no an open set U ⊂ M
such that every point of U is a periodic point, with all of them with the same
period.
Lemma 4.4 Let Φ be a C 0 -stable action. Given η > 0 there exists δ0 > 0
such that if {xg } is a δ-pseudotrajectory for Φ with δ < δ0 , then there exists
{e
xg } such that:
11

• d(xg , x
eg ) < η and

• Φa (e
xa−1 g ) = Φb (e
xb−1 g ) for all g ∈ F2 .
Proof:
Let {xg } be a δ-pseudotrajectory. We will define an equivalence relation
in {xg }. We say that xg is equivalent to xg′ if there exists n ∈ ZZ such that
g = (b−1 a)n g′ . Let [xg ] be the class of element of xg . Note that there exists
g0 ∈ F2 with minimum length such that [xg ] = [xg0 ] = {x(b−1 a)n g0 : n ∈ Z}.
Therefore the class [xg ] can be thought as a sequence {zn } such that zn =
x(b−1 a)n g0 , n ∈ ZZ.
Let’s prove that {zn } is a δ + δ1 -pseudotrajectory for the map Φb−1 Φa ,
where δ1 (δ) = M ax{d(Φb−1 (x), Φb−1 (y)) : d(x, y) < δ}.
d(Φb−1 Φa (zn ), zn+1 ) = d(Φb−1 Φa (x(b−1 a)n g0 ), x(b−1 a)n+1 g0 ) ≤
d(Φb−1 Φa (x(b−1 a)n g0 ), Φb−1 (xa(b−1 a)n g0 ))+d(Φb−1 (xa(b−1 a)n g0 ), x(b−1 a)n+1 g0 ) < δ1 (δ)+δ.
As the map Φb−1 Φa is C 0 -stable, then it has the shadowing property (see
′
′
[W] ). So given η > 0 there exists δ0 such that if δ1 (δ) + δ < δ0 then there
exists y such that
d((Φb−1 Φa )n (y), zn ) < η.
Therefore, for each [xg0 ] there exists yg0 ∈ M such that
d((Φb−1 Φa )n (yg0 ), x(b−1 a)n g0 ) < η.
Now, we define {e
xg } such that x
eg = (Φb−1 Φa )n (yg0 ) if g = (b−1 a)n g0 .
Note that xa−1 g is equivalent to xb−1 g , so Φb−1 a (e
xa−1 g ) = x
eb−1 g . Therefore Φa (e
xa−1 g ) = Φb (e
xb−1 g ) and d(xg , x
eg ) < η. So given η > 0 it is enough
′
to take δ0 such that δ1 (δ0 ) + δ0 < δ0 .
Proof of Theorem A.
Given η > 0, let δ0 be given by Lemma 4.4. Let {xg } be a δ pseudotrajectory with δ < δ0 . For each n ∈ N , let {xg }|g|≤n be, a δ − n pseudotrajectory.
Again, by Lemma 4.4 there exists {e
xg } such that d(xg , x
eg ) < η for |g| ≤ n.
By construction, x
eg = (Φb−1 Φa )m (yg0 ). As |g| ≤ n, by Remark 5, it is pos′
′
sible to take yg0 such that x
eg 6= x
eg′ if g 6= g with |g| ≤ n and |g | ≤ n.
By Lemma 4.1 it is enough to prove the Theorem A for a δ − n pseudotrajectory.
Given ε > 0 let
e is an action with d0 (Φ,
e Φ) < ρ then
• ρ > 0, ρ < ε/2, such that, if Φ
S
e g = Φg h for all g ∈ F2 .
there exists h : M → M , d(h, id) < ε/2 and hΦ

• η > 0, η < ε/2. We take δ < δ0 small enough such that for any {e
xg }
as above, (|g| ≤ n) with d(xg , x
eg ) < η there exists a diffeomorphisms
f : M → M , given by Lemma 4.2, such that:
