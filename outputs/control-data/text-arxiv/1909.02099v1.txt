ABSTRACT
We report the detection in Chandra ACIS archival data of an elongated soft (< 3keV) X-ray feature
to the south of the Compton Thick Active Galactic Nucleus (CT AGN) galaxy IC 2497, coincident
with the emission line feature known as Hanny’s Voorwerp. The data are consistent with the
spatial correspondence between X-ray, optical emission line, and radio features detected in
nearby obscured AGNs (e.g., ESO 428-G014). The X-ray luminosity of the (0.3 – 3.0 keV) soft
feature is ~1.2 x 1040 erg s-1. We infer an [OIII]/Soft-X-ray ratio in the range of ~ 200, consistent
with the highest values measured in some of the clouds of NGC 4151. Overall, given the
uncertainties, Hanny’s Voorwerp appears to be a feature consistent with the ionization cone
emission of nearby AGNs. We estimate an X-ray recombination time of ~2 x 107 yr, longer than
the [OIII] recombination time (~8000 yr). This suggests that extended soft X-ray components may
be a better diagnostic of overall long-term activity, while detection of an [OIII] HV would point to
a time-limited activity burst.
1. Introduction
The serendipitous discovery of an emission line feature (Hanny’s Voorwerp), ~20 kpc south of the
massive spiral galaxy IC 2497 (D~225 Mpc; 1” ~1 kpc; NED) led to the hypothesis of a past quasar
outburst ~105 yr ago in this apparently quiescent galaxy (Lintott et al. 2009; Schawinski et al.
2010). This discovery led to follow up work, which established associated radio emission (Jozsa
et al. 2009) and defined the detailed characteristics of the emission line feature (Keel et al. 2012).
Using Chandra, soft, slightly extended (~1 kpc), X-ray emission was reported in IC 2497, with an
emission temperature of ~1 keV, leading to the hypothesis of a hot bubble heated either by a
low-activity nucleus over a long time, or as a result of past intense quasar activity (Sartori et al.
2016). A Chandra-NuSTAR combined spectral study (Sartori et al. 2018) showed that the nucleus
of IC 2497 has the X-ray spectrum typical of a highly-obscured CT AGN with nuclear NH ∼ 2 × 1024
cm−2, and current intrinsic luminosity Lbol ∼ 2–5 × 1044 erg s−1, a factor of ~50 lower than implied
by the optical emission line properties of the Hanny’s Voorwerp (HV).
As IC 2497 is a CT AGN, then it may have the more extended X-ray emission seen in many other
obscured AGNs along the outflow axis (e.g., Bianchi et al. 2006, Levenson et al. 2006; Wang et al
2011a, b; Paggi et al 2012; Maksym et al. 2017, 2019; Fabbiano et al. 2018a). Moreover, the
optical spectrum shows a strong Ne V line (Lintott et al. 2009), which requires soft X-rays (> 0.2
keV) for ionization. We therefore undertook a search for low surface brightness extended
emission in the Chandra data, to compare its properties with those of other obscured nearby
AGNs that our group has been studying in detail. In this paper we report our results.

2. Data Analysis and Results
For this study we have used the two archival Chandra ACIS-S Cycle 13 observations of IC 2497
(obsid 13966 and 14381; PI: Schawinski). This is the same data used in the previous Chandra work
(Sartori et al. 2016, 2018). For this analysis, we used the latest version of CIAO (4.11), and the
version of the display and analysis tool DS9 included in CIAO 4.111. Following the CIAO threads,
we merged the datasets, to obtain a merged event file with a total 112 ks exposure. Comparison
with the parent images showed that no additional astrometric correction was needed. Given the
relatively few detected counts, we used the ACIS-S native instrumental binning of the data for
our analysis (0”.492 pixel size. Note that the ACIS-S pixel size is larger than the Chandra PSF
FWHM, ~0.2’’.) For display purposes, we performed a simple Gaussian smoothing of the image,
using the DS9 Gaussian smoothing function, with a radius of 5 image pixels and sigma of 2.5
pixels. The result is shown in Figure 1. Using wider smoothing functions (up to 4 pixel Gaussian)
does not change the results.
An elongated feature is evident at low energies, extending ~20’’ to the south of the IC 2497
central source, in the direction of HV. This feature is visible in the energy range (0.3-3.0 keV),
corresponding to the soft spectral component of IC 2497 (Sartori et al 2018), but it is the clearest
in the 0.3-1.5 keV band (Figure 1). Imaging in the 3-7 keV band results in a single point-like source
at the position of the nucleus of IC 2497. This is the source responsible for the hard continuum
and Fe Ka emission of the CT AGN (Sartori et al 2018).
A comparison of the counts in the ten azimuthal sectors shown in Figure 1 (radii=12”-32”) yields
44.3 net counts in the southern sector (0.3-1.5 keV), with a 5s statistical significance. The
background counts were estimated from the other sectors, with the exclusion of the two sectors
adjacent to that containing the feature. The data quality and analysis are similar to that in the
original discovery observation of extended emission in NGC 4151 (Elvis et al. 1983). Assuming a
thermal optically thin emission with kT~1 keV (consistent with the results of Sartori et al. 2016),
and a line of sight2 NH=1.3 x 1020 cm-2, the corresponding (0.3-3.0 keV) flux3 is ~2 x 10 -15 erg cm-2
s-1, corresponding to a luminosity of this feature of ~1.2 x 1040 erg s-1.

3. Discussion
Figure 2 shows the contours of the extended southern soft X-ray feature, overlaid onto the [OIII]
Hubble image of HV from Sartori et al. (2016). The X-ray feature overlaps HV and appears, at low
significance, to join it with the AGN nuclear source. This correspondence of soft extended X-ray
emission and emission line features is typical of what we have observed in the ionization cones
of nearby AGNs, as is the luminosity of the extended feature ~1040 erg s-1 (e.g., NGC 4151, Wang
et al. 2011b; Mkn 573, Paggi et al 2012; ESO 428-G014, Fabbiano et al 2018a). The most similar
case may be that of another probable “quasar relic”, NGC 5252 (Dadina et al., 2010), which show
similar soft X-ray and [OIII] spatial coincidence on a factor two smaller physical scale.

In these nearby AGNs we have also found correspondences between extended X-ray features
(both soft and, in ESO 428-G014, also at energies > 3 keV) and radio jet emission. Interestingly,
the same X-ray radio correspondence may occur in IC 2497, as shown by a comparison of the
Chandra X-ray contours with Figure 2 of Jozsa et al. (2009). The 1.4 GHz radio continuum is also
elongated in the N-S direction, overlapping the HV region, roughly in the same direction as the
soft X-rays, reinforcing the similarity with nearby AGNs. Both radio continuum, optical emission
line regions, and the Chandra emission to the south, reside in a local minimum of HI column
density (see Figure 2 of Jozsa et al. 2009) in the clouds that are found both to the E and W of the
radio continuum emission, at the redshift of IC 2497.
3.1 Inferred Physical Parameters
If the X-ray emission is mostly due to photoionization of a gas with the density inferred from the
HI measurements (Jozsa et al. 2009), assuming the peak column density (ne ~3x10-3 = NH/D ~
2x1020cm-2/~20 kpc), then its recombination time would be 2 x 107 yr (see Wang et al 2010,
Reynolds et al. 1995), much longer than the optical line recombination time of a few 1000 yr for
the hydrogen Balmer lines (Lintott et al. 2009; Keel et al. 2012). The [OIII] recombination time
would be ~70 times shorter (Binette and Robinson 1987). The X-ray emission would then persist
after the central continuum and [OIII] have faded. Using a more representative HI column
density, and so a lower density, would lengthen the recombination time. This suggests that we
might expect soft X-ray emission all the way back to the nucleus, and that “X-ray HVs” should be
more common than [OIII] HVs.
In the thermal case, using the detected X-ray luminosity and a volume of 20 kpc length and 2kpc
radius, we obtain gas densities of ~1 x 10-2 cm-3 and a longer cooling time, ~109 yr. In this case,
the X-ray emission would persist far longer than the optical emission. The NH estimate for the
cold HI gas (see above) gives a density comparable (within a factor of ~3) with that of the X-ray
gas, hence a much lower pressure. So, if the X-rays are thermal, the X-ray gas cannot be thermally
confined by the HI clouds. However, the thermal expansion timescale for a ~kpc typical size D is
tth ~ D / cs ~ 1kpc / 100 km s-1 ~ 107 yr. A 105 yr old event would not then have dissipated yet.

Hubble image of Hanny’s Voorwerp from Sartori et al. (2016), which also includes the peak
position of the X-ray emission of IC 2497 (in colors).
3.2 Comparison with Photoionized Extended components of AGNs
The Chandra spectra of extended X-ray regions in nearby AGNs show both thermal and
photoionization components, with photoionization dominating (e.g., Wang et al. 2011b; Paggi et
al 2012; Fabbiano et al 2018a). Comparison of the [OIII] and soft (0.5 – 2 keV) X-ray luminosity of
extended features in nearby AGNs shows a small range of ratios (Bianchi et al. 2006). Bianchi et
al. (2006) demonstrated that higher [OIII]/X-ray ratios correspond to lower values of the
ionization parameter U, defined as the ratio of the incident ionizing flux over the cloud density.
With Chandra, cloud by cloud comparisons in NGC 4151 from HRC (Wang et al. 2009) and ACIS
observations (Wang et al. 2011b) suggest consistent ratios, with values ~10 to 15, over a large
range of radii (~20pc -~2000pc; see Figure 3).
The constant ratio of photoionized clouds in NGC 4151 is suggestive of emission from an
expanding wind (Wang et al. 2009, 2011b; Figure 3). Although this is not necessarily a general
feature. In NGC4151, the exception are clouds where thermal emission by radio jet driven shocks
may occur, increasing the X-ray emission, and two inner clouds, where the ratios are significantly
larger, implying relatively lower X-ray fluxes (Wang et al 2009; see left panel of Figure 3). Wang
et al. (2009) suggest that these lower fluxes may result from the effect of intervening absorbers,
covering the nuclear source. Alternatively, the [OIII] / soft X-ray ratio may be larger because of a
higher density in these clouds as they are swept up by the outflow. Different localized regions in
ESO 428-G014 also appear to be consistent with different ionization parameters (Fabbiano et al
2018b).

Using the integrated [OIII] flux for HV from Lintott et al. (2009) ~3.2 x 10-13 erg cm-2 s-1, and the
(0.5-2 keV) luminosity of ~1x1040 erg s-1 (for the parameters of Section 2), we estimate the
[OIII]/soft X-ray luminosity ratio of the extended feature to be ~200.
Figure 3. compares this value with the clouds of NGC 4151 (Wang et al. 2009, 2011) and the
average ratios of other nearby Seyferts (see the left panel of Fig. 3, from Wang et al. 2009). The
HV ratio is higher (lower ionization parameter), than the average ratios shown in this figure, but
perhaps comparable (given the uncertainties) with the highest values obtained for some of the
NGC 4151 clouds.

Figure 3. – This figure is an adaptation of Figure 6 of Wang et al. (2009; left panel) and Figure 15
of Wang et al. (2011b; right panel). We have added the estimated [OIII] to soft X-ray flux ratio for
the HV feature (pink rectangle). While quite uncertain, this ratio is consistent only with the
highest values measured from individual clouds in NGC 4151 (the circles with error bars). The
filled circles identify the clouds in NGC 4151, where the X-ray emission is likely to contain an
additional thermal component from the interaction with the radio jets (Wang et al 2009; Wang
et al 2011a). As explained in Wang et al. (2009), the blue, red, green, and magenta lines indicate
the [O III]/X-ray ratios for NGC 7212, NGC 3393, Mrk 3, and NGC 1386 (Bianchi et al. 2006),
respectively. The dotted, dashed, solid, and dot-dashed lines are the CLOUDY model predicted
values from Bianchi et al. (2006) for different radial density profiles: ne ∝ rβ where β = −1.6, −1.8,
−2, and −2.2, respectively.
Since the recombination time estimated for [OIII] is shorter than that estimated for the X-rays
(Section 3.1), these high ratios cannot be due to the different time scales of ‘fading’ of a past
quasar outburst. They may reflect differences in the incident ionizing flux and / or local cloud
density relative to those observed in the majority of cases displayed in Figure 3. In contrast, the
NGC 5252 relic has a low (~0.5-2) [OIII] / soft X-ray ratio (Dadina et al. 2010), comparable to the
radio jet termination (thermal) regions in NGC 4151. Interestingly, Lintott et al. (2009) also find a

low ionization parameter log U = -2.2 in the HV, from the [OII] 3727 to the [OIII] 5007 line ratio,
although they also report high ionization lines (HeII 4616 and [NeV] 3346, 3426,) suggesting a
complex emitting medium.
4. Conclusions
A new search of the Chandra images of IC 2497 for low surface brightness emission has led to the
discovery of an elongated soft X-ray feature connecting the AGN with the emission line feature
known as Hanny’s Voorwerp. The X-ray feature is roughly spatially consistent with the radio
continuum emission at 1.4 GHz (Jozsa et al. 2009). However, both the limited statistics of the Xray data, and the relatively large radio beam of the Jozsa et al. data, impede a detailed
comparison of these features. The present data are overall consistent with the spatial
correspondence between X-ray, optical emission line, and radio features detected in nearby AGN
(see e.g., ESO 428-G014, Fabbiano et al 2018b).
The average (0.5 – 2. keV) X-ray luminosity ~1 x 1040 erg s-1, compared to the inferred [OIII]
luminosity L[OIII]~4-14 x 1041 erg s-1, is consistent with the highest values measured in some of
the clouds of NGC 4151 (Wang et al. 2009; 2011b), although higher than average values for other
nearby Seyferts. Overall, given the uncertainties, Hanny’s Voorwerp could be a feature consistent
with the ionization cone emission of nearby AGNs. If both [OIII] and soft X-ray emission are due
to photoionization, the X-ray recombination time is ~2 x 107 yr, longer than the [OIII]
recombination time (a few 1000 years or less). This suggest that extended soft X-ray components
may be a better diagnostic of overall activity, while detection of an [OIII] HV would point to a
time-limited activity burst.
Future deeper high-resolution X-ray and radio observations will be needed to explore this
extended emission at higher resolution and statistical significance. Unreasonably long exposure
times would be required to pursue this investigation with Chandra, because of the deterioration
of the ACIS response at the lower energies. With Chandra we could achieve comparable data
quality on HV as the Einstein Observatory could yield for the extended emission of NGC 4151
(Elvis et al. 1983). To reach the level of detail Chandra gives for NGC 4151 (e.g., Wang et al 2011a,
b) for HV will require Lynx. The proposed Lynx mission would give 1000 counts in ~75 ksec,
sufficient for detailed mapping and spectra.
