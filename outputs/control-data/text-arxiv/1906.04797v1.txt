Summary
The displacements representations of the type used by Christensen and Lo (1979)
are modified to allow for analytical treatment of problems involving spherical and
circular material surfaces that possess constant surface tension. The modified
representations are used to derive closed-form expressions for the local elastic fields
and effective moduli of a macroscopically isotropic composite materials containing
spherical and circular inhomogeneities with the interfaces described by the complete
Gurtin-Murdoch and Steigmann-Ogden models.

Keywords: Circular and spherical inhomogeneities, Christensen-Lo solutions, GurtinMurdoch and Steigmann-Ogden models, Effective properties
1. Introduction
In their paper, Christensen and Lo (1979) presented new micromechanical scheme, the
generalized self-consistent scheme, for the evaluation of the effective shear moduli of
macroscopically isotropic composites containing cylindrical and spherical inhomogeneities.
The scheme utilizes the three phases model that involves a spherical or circular
inhomogeneity, a spherical or circular annulus of matrix material, and an infinite outer
region of equivalent homogeneous material subjected to uniform far-field load.
For the case of arbitrary load, the rigorous solution of such model problem would involve
the use of infinite series (inner and outer spherical harmonics in three dimensions or Laurent
and Taylor series in two dimensions) and could be quite complex. Instead, Christensen
and Lo (1979) suggested to use the closed-form representations for the displacements in
spherical and cylindrical coordinate systems for the special far-field load - simple shear. The

representations were not new; they have been used earlier for various problems involving
spherical or circular boundaries, see Love (1927) for the three-dimensional case and Savin
(1961) for the two-dimensional one. However, they became much more popular after
publication of Christensen and Lo (1979) paper and have been extensively used for the
problems involving inhomogeneities with interphases, imperfect interfaces, and material
surfaces, see e.g. Benveniste et al. (1989), Herve and Zaoui (1993), Duan et al. (2006), Xu
et al. (2016), Zemlyanova and Mogilevskaya (2018a), among many others.
We note that another type of displacement representations for the axisymmetric problems
with spherical surfaces was suggested in e.g. Goodier (1933), see also Lurie (1964), and used
for the problems with imperfect interfaces and material surfaces in e.g. Duan et al. (2005,
2007), He and Li (2006), Lim et al. (2006), Mi and Kouris (2006). While the solution
for the case of simple shear far-field load can be obtained from the superposition of the
appropriately chosen axisymmetric solutions, see e.g. Hashin (1991), the related procedure
requires an additional step and the derivations associated with that step.
One limitation of Christensen and Lo (1979) type representations is that they are not valid
for the problems with surface and interface effects as they do not include surface tension.
Another limitation is that they involve unknown coefficients, which in many cases have to
be found numerically from the system of linear algebraic equations, thus not allowing for
accurate identification of all governing problem parameters.
The concept of surface tension is important in modeling of various nano-sized phenomena
where the influence of the surface becomes more significant due to the high surface-areato-volume ratio, see e.g. Cahn and Larch (1982), Miller and Shenoy (2000), Sharma and
Ganti (2002, 2004), Sharma et al. (2003), Dingreville et al. (2005), Lim et al. (2006), He
and Li (2006), Huang and Wang (2006), Mi and Kouris (2006), Mogilevskaya et al. (2008,
2010), Ru (2010), Chhapadia et al (2011), Kushch et al. (2011, 2013), Chatzigeorgiou et
al. (2017), Javili et al. (2017), and many others.
The models proposed by Gurtin-Murdoch (1975, 1978) and Steigmann-Ogden (1997,
1999) are the most studied continuum models of material surfaces with surface tension.
In these models, the interface between the material constituents is treated as either a
membrane (Gurtin-Murdoch model) or a shell (Steigmann-Ogden model) of vanishing
thickness possessing surface tension as well as corresponding surface elastic properties.
Only a few closed-form solutions of the inhomogeneity problems involving the complete
Gurtin-Murdoch model have been reported so far, perhaps due notorious difficulties in
handling effects introduced by surface tension. Quite naturally, the benchmark problems,
for which analytical solutions could be constructed, involve regular shapes of material
surfaces. These solutions have been reported for the case of circular inhomogeneity in
e.g. Mogilevskaya et all. (2008), Jammes et al. (2009), for elliptical inhomogeneity in
Kushch et al. (2014), for spherical inhomogeneity in Lim et al. (2006), He and Li (2006),
Kushch et al. (2011, 2013), and spheroidal inhomogeneity in Kushch (2018), Kushch et al.
(2018). The methods used in these publications were quite complex, which was justified
for the problems involving multiple inhomogeneities. However, for the important case of
a single inhomogeneity, often used in various single-inhomogeneity-based homogenization
schemes, it is desirable to devise simpler solution by modifying the representations used by
Christensen and Lo (1979).
To the best knowledge of the authors, no publication reports the solution of the problem
of a spherical inhomogeneity with the interface described by the complete Steigmann-Ogden

model (with a full set of interface parameters) and non-hydrostatic loading conditions. The
first and the only publication that considered the Steigmann-Ogden model for spherical
inhomogeneity was by Zemlyanova and Mogilevskaya (2018a) who presented the solutions
for two particular cases: (i) hydrostatic load (when the problem becomes one-dimensional)
and (ii) deviatoric load & zero surface tension (when the problem can be solved by using
classical Christensen and Lo type displacement representations). As stated above, the latter
representations are not valid for the cases involving surface tension and that was the reason
why the authors of that work have not been able to solve the problem in more general
setting. The two-dimensional solutions for the problem of circular inhomogeneities with the
complete Steigmann-Ogden interface model are reported in Zemlyanova and Mogilevskaya
(2018b) and Han et al. (2018). However, they too were obtained with tedious algebra that,
for the case of a single inhomogeneity, could be avoided, if simpler representations of the
type used by Christensen and Lo (1979) could be modified to include surface tension.
Thus, the goal of the present paper is three-fold. First, we present new Christensen and Lo
(1979) type representations to allow for simple analytical solutions of the problems involving
spherical and circular material surfaces possessing constant surface tension. Second, using
the obtained representations, we derive new analytical solution for the problem of a
spherical inhomogeneity with the interface described by the complete Steigmann-Ogden
model. Finally, we provide closed-form analytical expressions for the coefficients involved in
those representations for the cases of the complete Gurtin-Murdoch and Steigmann-Ogden
models. We emphasize again that the focus of the present paper is not on the modification
of micromechanical scheme of Christensen and Lo (1979) but rather on the representations
they used to obtain it. The new representations devised here could be used in variety of
micromechanical schemes one of which, Maxwell’s (1873) homogenization scheme, is used
in the present paper.
The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we review the Christensen and Lo
representations for the case of simple shear far-field load and, for completeness, provide
similar representation for the case of hydrostatic load. In Section 3 (with the details provided
in Appendix A), we use analytical solutions for the problems of a circular inhomogeneity
with the complete Gurtin-Murdoch (Mogilevskaya et al., 2008) and Steigmann-Ogden
(Zemlyanova and Mogilevskaya, 2018b) interfaces to construct the Christensen and Lo
(1979) type representations for the hydrostatic and simple shear far-field loads. In Section
4 (with the details provided in Appendix B), we use analytical solution of Kushch et al.
(2011) to presents analogous representations for the problem of a spherical inhomogeneity
with the complete Gurtin-Murdoch interface. In Section 5, we use the representations of
Section 4 to obtain new analytical solution for the problem of a spherical inhomogeneity
with the interface described by the complete Steigmann-Ogden model. In Section 6, we
use this solution in combination with Maxwell’s (1873) methodology to derive the singleinhomogeneity based estimate of the effective shear modulus of macroscopically isotropic
material containing spherical inhomogeneities with interfaces described by the complete
Steigmann-Ogden model. In Section 7, we present a summary of our results and conclusions.

2. Christensen and Lo (1979) representations for circular and spherical
inhomogeneities
Consider the problem of a circular (Fig.1a) or a spherical (Fig.1b) inhomogeneity of radius
∞
R embedded into an infinite matrix and subjected to uniform far field load σkj
, k, j =
1, . . . , d, where d = 2 in two dimensions and d = 3 in three dimensions. The center of the
inhomogeneity is located at the origin of the Cartesian coordinate system. Assume also
that the bulk material of the matrix (inhomogeneity) is linearly elastic and isotropic; the
corresponding elastic moduli for the two phases are shear modulus µ(µI ) and Poisson’s ratio
ν(νI ). The interface conditions between the matrix and inhomogeneity are not specified at
this time.

Note that the representations of Eqs. (2.1)-(2.5) are not valid for the problems with
surface tension. We add also that Christensen and Lo (1979) considered a three-phase
model and their set of representations included expressions for the displacements inside the
third phase (interphase), which is not present in the problems under study that deal with
material surfaces of vanishing thicknesses.
For the completeness, we also list here the representations for the case of hydrostatic

load (the only non-vanishing far-field stresses are σkk
= σh∞ , k = 1, . . . , d ). Such
representations are often used for the evaluation of the effective bulk modulus. The problem

3. Representations for a circular inhomogeneity with the Gurtin-Murdoch and
Steigmann-Ogden interfaces
Consider circular inhomogeneity shown on Fig.1a. In both models, the displacements are
continuous across the interface but the tractions undergo jumps. The tractions jump
conditions for the more general Steigmann-Ogden model (characterized by the elastic
parameters µ0 , λ0 , surface tension σ0 , and bending parameters ζ0 and χ0 ) can be written
as, see Zemlyanova and Mogilevskaya (2018b)

in which ur and uϑ are local components of the surface displacements in the local coordinate
system (r, ϑ) shown in Fig 1a, σrr , σrϑ are the corresponding components of tractions in
that system, and the subscript “,” indicates differentiation, e.g. uϑ,ϑ = ∂uϑ /∂ϑ.
The tractions jump conditions for the Gurtin-Murdoch model could be recovered from
Eqs. (3.1), (3.2) by assuming that the bending parameters vanish, i.e. ζ0 = 0 and χ0 = 0.
If the entire system is subjected to uniform far-field load, both problems can be solved
analytically using complex variables formalism, see Mogilevskaya et al. (2008), Zemlyanova
and Mogilevskaya (2018b). Using these solutions (briefly reviewed in Appendix A) and some
algebra, the polar coordinates of the displacements everywhere in the composite system can
be expressed in the following closed forms:

last two expressions of Eqs. (A16) of Appendix A. The meanings of remaining parameters
involved in Eqs. (3.3)-(3.5) are also explained in that appendix.
It follows from the representations of Eqs. (3.3), (3.4) that the only difference between
them and those of Christensen and Lo (1979) are in radial components of the displacements,
which now has the following forms:

Consider spherical inhomogeneity shown on Fig.1b. In the Gurtin-Murdoch model, the
displacements are continuous across the interface but the tractions undergo jumps. The
tractions jump conditions for the model (in which the interface is characterized by the
elastic parameters µ0 , λ0 and the surface tension σ0 ) can be written as, see Kushch et al.
(2013), Zemlyanova and Mogilevskaya (2018a), (the latter paper had a misprint, missing

at the following component representations of Eqs. (4.10), (4.11):

Eqs. (B5)-(B7) presented in Appendix B.
It can be seen that the only difference between the representations of Eqs. (4.12)-(4.17)
and those of Christensen and Lo (1979) is in radial displacements, which now have the

Eqs. (5.4)-(5.9) involve the components of the tensor of changes of curvature κ and the
bending stiffness parameters χ0 , ζ0 .
Now, assuming simple shear load at infinity, we propose to use the representations of Eqs.
(4.12)-(4.17) for obtaining the new solution for the problem of a spherical inhomogeneity
with the complete Steigmann-Ogden interface. In Zemlyanova and Mogilevskaya (2018a),
the solution for the simple shear far-field load was only presented for the case of zero surface
tension.
Substitution of the representations of Eqs. (4.12)-(4.17) into Eqs. (5.1)-(5.3) leads to the
following expressions for the jumps of boundary tractions:

The first and third equations of Eqs. (5.10) are identical to the corresponding equations
involved in Eqs. (B3) from Zemlyanova and Mogilevskaya (2018a). The second equation of
Eqs. (5.10) is corrected version of the second equation involved in Eqs. (B3) from the same
paper, which had a misprint that, however, have not affected the results presented there.
The use of Eqs. (5.10) together with the conditions of continuity of displacements
across the boundary of the sphere leads to the linear system of four equations to find
the unknown coefficients Eqs.(2.4)-(2.5). This linear system and its solution are presented
in the Appendix C.
To illustrate the effects of the Steigmann-Ogden interface parameters, we consider the
example similar to that presented in Zemlyanova and Mogilevskaya (2018a) that involves a
cavity of radius R = 5 nm and assume that the normalized simple shear stress at infinity is
σd /µ = 0.000028818

(5.11)

We also adopt the following three values of the normalized surface tension:
σ0 /µR = 0, σ0 /µR = 0.0067435, σ0 /µR = 0.0097983

(5.12)

The rest of the parameters for the example are chosen to be identical to the following
ones used in Zemlyanova and Mogilevskaya (2018a):

ν = 0.3, µ0 /µR = 0.030156, λ0 /µR = 0.060312, γ/µ = 0.00028382

(5.13)

On Fig. 2, we plotted the normalized hoop stress σθθ /µ along the meridian line ϕ = 0
at the cavity surface (0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2). It can be seen that the surface tension has significant
effect on the normalized hoop stress variation. The normalized stress becomes compressive
when σ0 6= 0 and its absolute value increases with the increase in the surface tension. It
could also be observed from the plots of Fig. 2 that, for this special case of simple shear
far-field load, the variation of the hoop stress with the angle θ is small with the maximum
(minimum) achieved at θ = 0 ( θ = π/2), respectively.

The normalized stress σzz /µ along the same meridian line ϕ = 0 at the cavity surface is
plotted on Fig. 3. Here too, the surface tension has significant effect on the stress variation
reaching its maximum at θ = 0 and minimum at θ = π/2. We also notice that, for the
simple shear far-field load, the variation of σzz /µ with the angle θ is more pronounced than
that of σθθ /µ.
To illustrate size-dependence of the surface related stresses, consider an additional example
of the matrix made from anodic alumina (µ = 34.7GPA and ν = 0.3) containing the
cavity whose radius varies from R = 5 nm to R = 20 nm. We fix the value of surface
tension as σ0 = 1.7N/m and that of the simple shear stress as σd = 100 MPA. The value
of R-independent parameter parameter γ is chosen to be the same as the corresponding
expression in Eq. (5.13), while the remaining parameters are chosen as
µ0 = 5.2321N/m, λ0 = 10.4641N/m

(5.14)

which for R = 5 nm are consistent with the parameters used in expressions of Eq. (5.13).
Fig. 4 illustrates the variation of the normalized hoop stress σθθ /σd along the line ϕ = π/2
at the cavity surface (0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2) for various values of R. For comparison, we also plotted

6. Effective properties of the isotropic particulate composites with the
complete Steigmann-Ogden model of interfaces
The new analytical solution of previous section will now be used to derive the
single-inhomogeneity-based approximation formula for the effective shear modulus of

14

ET AL.

macroscopically isotropic composites containing spherical inhomogeneities with the
interfaces described by the complete Steigmann-Ogden model. Similar formula for the
effective bulk modulus was reported in Zemlyanova and Mogilevskaya (2018a,b).
To obtain shear modulus µef , we will use Maxwell’s (1873) concept of equivalent
inhomogeneity, see e.g. McCartney (2010), Mogilevskaya et al. (2012), and apply the same
two-stage procedure as in Mogilevskaya et al. (2018) and Zemlyanova and Mogilevskaya
(2018a,b).
On the first stage, the problem involving a composite system containing an inhomogeneity
with the complete Steigmann-Ogden interface and subjected to simple shear far-field load is
solved twice, once with both the external load and surface tension included and the second
time with just surface tension. The solution of the second problem is then subtracted from
that for the first problem. This procedure is needed to eliminate the residual effects due
to the presence of the surface tension, see Mogilevskaya et al. (2010). As the results, the
displacements in the matrix will be given by Eqs. (4.15)-(4.18) with D0 = 0 and remaining
coefficients found from the system of Eqs. (C1)-(C2) of Appendix C.
Then, we equate the coefficient D4 for the leading 1/r2 (dipole) term in the obtained
displacements with that related to the problem involving the equivalent perfectly bonded
inhomogeneity of the same radius with the unknown shear modulus µeq to find the value of
that modulus.
On the second stage, the obtained modulus of the equivalent inhomogeneity could be used
in any single-inhomogeneity-based homogenization scheme for perfectly bonded spherical
particles. Here, we will use the following Maxwell type approximation formulae, McCartney
(2010):
µeq + µ∗ + cµ∗ (µeq /µ − 1)
µef
=
µ
µeq + µ∗ − c (µeq − µ)

(6.1)

with c being the volume fraction of the equivalent inhomogeneity and
µ∗ = µ

9K + 8µ
µ 9λ + 14µ
=
6 (K + 2µ)
2 3λ + 8µ

(6.2)

The solution for the problem of perfectly bonded inhomogeneity can be extracted from
Eq. (4.18) by assuming vanishing surface parameters. The coefficient for the leading 1/r2
(dipole) term for that case is (5 − 4ν) D4eq / (1 − 2ν) in which
D4eq = −

(µeq /µ − 1) σd∞ R3
5
2 (9λ + 14µ) + 2 (µeq /µ) (8λ + 3µ)

(6.3)

with λ = K (3) − 2µ/3.
Thus, assuming that D4eq = D4S−O , µeq could be obtained as
D4S−O
4µ + 5λ
µeq
= 1 − 2R−3

−3
µ
1 + 4 (D4 R /σd ) (3µ + 8λ) /5 σd∞
in which D4S−O /σd∞ can be found from Eqs. (C4) of Appendix C.
Using the following notation:

(6.5)

and substituting Eq. (6.4) into Eq. (6.1), we obtain the following expression for the effective
shear modulus µef :

To illustrate the effects of the Steigmann-Ogden interface parameters on the effective
shear modulus of the composite material with overall isotropy, we consider the example
of the preceding section with the parameters given by Eqs. (5.11)-(5.13) and use Eq.
(6.6) to estimate µef . Fig. 4 presents the plots of the normalized effective shear modulus
as a function of the volume fraction of the cavities; the plot for the classical case with
µ0 = λ0 = γ = σ0 = 0 (solid line) is presented there as well. It could be seen from Fig. 4
that while the effects of surface elastic parameters lead to the increase in overall stiffness
of the composite, the influence of surface tension is insignificant as its variation does not
noticeable affect the value of µef /µ.

Fig. 5 Normalized effective shear modulus for the composite material with overall isotropy

To separate the influences of the elastic interface parameters, we assumed that σ0 = 0
and evaluated, using the single-inhomogeneity based estimate of Eq. (6.6), the values
of the normalized effective shear modulus for three different cases: i) classical case with
no surface effects, ii) the case with γ/µ = 0 (G-M model), and iii) the case with with
γ/µ = 0.00028382 (S-O model). The remaining elastic parameters were taken from the
corresponding expressions of Eq. (5.13). The estimates for all three cases are presented in
the Table 1 for three values of the volume fractions.
It could be seen from the table that, for the parameters considered, the combined influence

of the surface elasticity parameters µ0 , λ0 on the normalized effective shear modulus is
significantly larger than the influence of the bending parameter γ, especially for the smaller
volume fractions of the cavities.
7. Conclusions
This paper presents two new important contributions to the studies of the surface/interface
effects in heterogeneous media.
The first contribution is the analytical representations similar to those of Christensen
and Lo (1979) that could be used for solutions of various problems involving spherical and
circular material surfaces that possess constant surface tension. These representations are
derived here for the first time. While in the present paper we used them for the analysis of
two specific interface models, we envision that they could be used for the analysis of various
Eshelby-type problems, including new problems that might emerge in studies of surface
effects. The obtained representations significantly simplify the solutions of such problems
and can be useful in the comparative studies of various surface/interface models and their
influences on the local behavior of the fiber- and particle reinforced nano composites. They
should be especially valuable for the researchers of engineering community as they are
presented in ready-to use forms and require relatively little algebra. In addition, they could
be extremely valuable to the researchers in the area of Micromechanics as they allow for
easy construction of various single-inhomogeneity-based estimates for overall properties of
such materials.
The second contribution is the new analytical solution of the problem of a spherical
inhomogeneity with the interface described by the complete Steigmann-Ogden model. This
solution is important for the analysis of the local and overall behavior of nano-scale
materials and, at the very least, the investigators who want to numerically solve more
complicated problems involving material surfaces could utilize our solution as benchmark
example. This solution was readily obtained with the use of the new Christensen and
Lo’s type representations for the displacements, while the alternative and may be more
straightforward approach to obtain it would require the use of tedious algebra of spherical
harmonics. The attractive feature of this new solution is that all the coefficients involved in
it are provided as closed-form analytical expressions. This allows for accurate identification
of all governing dimensionless problem parameters and their influences on the solution.

As the Steigmann-Ogden model reduces to that of Gurtin-Murdoch, Eqs. (C1)-(C3) should
reproduce the corresponding equations of Eqs. (B5)-(B7), when the bending parameters vanish,
i.e. γ = 0. After some algebraic manipulations, not shown here, we have verified that this was,
indeed, the case.
The system of Eqs. (C1)-(C2) can be solved analytically leading to the following expressions for
the coefficients A1 , A2 , D3 , D4 :
A1 /D1 = F (E22 − E12 )/(E11 E22 − E12 E21 )
A2 /D1 = F (E11 − E21 )R−2 /(E11 E22 − E12 E21 )
