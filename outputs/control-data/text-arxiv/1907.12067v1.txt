Abstract
We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for Poincaré Lie superalgebras in any dimension and signature to be isomorphic. This reduces
the classification problem, up to certain discrete operations, to classifying the orbits of the Schur group on the vector space of superbrackets.
We then classify four-dimensional N = 2 supersymmetry algebras,
which are found to be unique in Euclidean and in neutral signature,
while in Lorentz signature there exist two algebras with R-symmetry
groups U(2) and U(1, 1), respectively. By dimensional reduction we
construct two off shell vector multiplet representations for each possible signature, and find that the corresponding Lagrangians always
have a different relative sign between the scalar and the Maxwell term.
In Lorentzian signature this is related to the existence of two nonisomorphic algebras, while in Euclidean and neutral signature the two
theories are related by a local field redefinition which implements an
isomorphism between the underlying supersymmetry algebras.

Introduction

Supersymmetry can be defined in any space-time signature. Besides Lorentzian signature, Euclidean signature has received a good deal of attention because of its relevance for the functional integral formalism, non-perturbative
effects, and the construction of stationary solutions through dimensional
reduction to an auxiliary Euclidean theory. Other signatures have been
studied less, but naturally arise in string theory in a variety of situations.
Firstly, string theory with local N = 2 supersymmetry on the worldsheet
3

has a four-dimensional target space with neutral signature (2, 2), and excitations corresponding to self-dual gravity and self-dual Yang-Mills theory
[1, 2]. Secondly, F-theory may be viewed as a twelve-dimensional theory in
signature (2, 10) [3], and hidden symmetries of M-theory suggest an embedding into a thirteen-dimensional theory with signature (2, 11) [4]. Thirdly,
space-time signature can be changed in type-II string theory and in M-theory
by a chain of T- and S-duality transformations, once T-duality along timelike directions is admitted [5, 6, 7]. This leads to an extended web of string
theories, M-theories and of the world volume theories of the corresponding
branes. The world volumes of some of these branes can host Yang-Mills
type theories where the gauge ‘group’ is a Lie supergroup [8]. Supergravity
theories with non-standard space-time signature have been discussed within
the framework of exceptional field theory in [9]. Being able to construct and
relate supersymmetric theories systematically across signatures is therefore
of considerable interest.
On the mathematical side, N -extended Poincaré Lie superalgebras in

general signature (t, s) have been constructed and classified, in arbitrary dimension and for arbitrary N , in [10]. This work was extended to a classification of polyvector charges (BPS charges) in [11]. While this construction

allows one to obtain all Poincaré Lie superalgebras, it does not immediately provide a classification up to isomorphism, for the following reason:
the essential ingredients in extending a Poincaré Lie algebra g0 = p(V ) =
∼ Rt,s , to a Poincaré Lie superalgebra are: (i) the
so(V ) + V , where V =
specification of a spinorial module (spin 1/2 representation) S which serves
as the odd part, g = g0 + g1 = (so(V ) + V ) + S, and (ii), the specification
of the superbracket on S. More precisely, as shown in [10], one needs to
specify a real, symmetric, vector-valued, Spin0 (V )-equivariant bilinear form
Π : S × S → V , which defines the restriction of the superbracket to S × S,

[s, t] := Π(s, t) for all s, t ∈ S. Such vector-valued bilinear forms form a
vector space, and, as shown in [10], a basis can be constructed in terms
4

of so-called admissible bilinear forms β : S × S → R. While all possible

Poincaré Lie superalgebras can be obtained this way, one still needs criteria
which allow one to decide whether the algebras defined by any two given

superbrackets are isomorphic, or not. This is the problem which we address
and solve in the first part of this paper. Theorem 1 gives a necessary and sufficient condition for two Poincaré Lie superalgebras to be isomorphic, while
subsequently Corollary 1 shows that the classification problem amounts to,
essentially (see Remark 1), classifying the orbits of the so-called Schur group
C ∗ (S) on the space of superbrackets. The Schur group is the subgroup of

GL(S) the elements of which commute with the action of Spin0 (V ). The
stabilizer subgroup of the Schur group on a given orbit is the R-symmetry
group of the corresponding supersymmetry algebra.
As an application of this general result we obtain the classification of
four-dimensional N = 2 supersymmetry algebras for all signatures (0, 4), . . . ,

(4, 0). Here N = 2 supersymmetry refers to supersymmetry algebras whose
odd part is the complex spinor module S ∼
= C4 , that is the representation by
Dirac spinors. Note that for some signatures this is the minimal supersymmetry algebra. Since signatures (t, s) and (s, t) are physically equivalent, as
they are related by going from a mostly plus to a mostly minus convention
for the metric, or, for neutral signature, swapping of time-like against spacelike dimensions, there are three cases to consider: Euclidean, Lorentzian
and neutral signature. In all cases the space of N = 2 superbrackets is

four-dimensional, and different isomorphism classes of N = 2 supersymmetry algebras are represented by elements in different open orbits of the
Schur group. In cases where the N = 2 supersymmetry algebra is non-

minimal, N = 1 supersymmetry algebras are related to lower-dimensional

orbits. While in Euclidean and in neutral signature the N = 2 supersym-

metry algebra is shown to be unique up to isomorphism, we find that there
are two Lorentzian N = 2 supersymmetry algebras, distinguished by their

R-symmetry groups, which are U(2) and U(1, 1) respectively. The super5

symmetry algebra with non-compact R-symmetry group is of the same type
as the ‘twisted’ or ‘type-*’ supersymmetry algebras that occur when timelike T-duality is applied to ‘conventional’ theories, the prime example being
the map between IIA/B and IIB∗ /IIA∗ string theory [5]. The trademark of
these Lorentzian signature theories is that some fields have the ‘wrong sign’
in front of their kinetic term, that is, some fields have negative kinetic energy. While this feature raises the question whether such theories are stable,
there are good reasons for admitting them within string theory, as has been
argued in [6].
In a second part of this paper, starting from Section 5, we turn to explicit
off shell field theory representations of four-dimensional N = 2 theories for
all signatures. We make use of the five-dimensional vector multiplet theories

which were constructed in [12] for all six signatures (0, 5), . . . , (5, 0). In five
dimensions the space of superbrackets is one-dimensional, that is the superbracket is unique up to rescaling, which leads to a unique vector multiplet
theory in each signature. Performing all ten possible dimensional reductions we obtain two vector multiplet theories in each of the five signatures
(0, 4), . . . , (4, 0), which correspond to specific points in the four-dimensional
space of superbrackets on four-dimensional space-time. We then show that
the two theories in Lorentz signature realize two non-isomorphic supersymmetry algebras, while for the theories in Euclidean and neutral signature we
find explicit local field redefinitions relating them.
Our approach allows us to extract the essential information about the
structure of supersymmetric theories from the classification of supersymmetry algebras, and this way to extend previous results about vector multiplet
theories in various signatures in four and five dimensions. We construct full
off shell vector multiplet representations and the corresponding Lagrangians,
including fermionic terms. Vector multiplets coupled to supergravity have
been investigated before in an approach based on the dimensional reduction
of the bosonic on-shell Lagrangians and of the Killing spinor equations of
6

ten- and eleven-dimensional supergravity [13, 14, 15]. We find the same
types of scalar target space geometries, namely special Kähler in Lorentz
signature and special para-Kähler in Euclidean and in neutral signature.
The relative signs between scalar and vector terms agree with [15], and like
[14] we find that that the relative sign between the scalar and vector term in
Euclidean signature is conventional and can be changed by a field redefinition. However the transformation proposed in [14] is a strong-weak coupling
duality, and therefore acts non-locally on the vector potential, while ours is
local, defined at the level of the off shell vector multiplet representation, and
is induced by an isomorphism of the underlying supersymmetry algebras.
The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 presents our general result on the classification of Poincaré Lie superalgebras up to isomorphism, while Section 3 carries out the classification of N = 2 supersymmetry algebras in four dimensions. These two sections can be read as a self-

contained mathematical treatment of supersymmetry algebras. Sections 4
and 5 present the vector multiplet representations of four-dimensional N = 2
supersymmetry algebras for all signatures. While using and relating to the
results of Section 3, readers primarily interested in physics applications can
start reading at Section 4 and look back into Sections 2 and 3 for a more
detailed explanation. Section 4 reviews the five-dimensional supersymme∼ C4 , and then carries
try algebras based on the complex spinor module S =
out the reduction to four dimension, which allows us to relate the resulting
four-dimensional supersymmetry algebras to the classification. It then introduces the doubled spinor formalism, which we use in constructing field
∼ S ⊗ C2
theory representations. The idea is to work with two copies S ⊕ S =
of the spinor module, which allows us to disentangle the actions of Lorentz

group and of the Schur group, and then to restrict to the physical degrees of
freedom by conveniently imposing a reality condition using the above tensor
product decomposition. Besides Majorana and symplectic Majorana conditions, this involves modified Majorana conditions similar to those used in [6]
7

in the context of type-II∗ string theories. Section 4 provides a self-contained
account of this doubled spinor formalism, and applies it to construct isomorphisms between four-dimensional supersymmetry algebras, to be used
later to relate theories obtained by dimensional reduction.
Section 5 contains the four-dimensional vector multiplet representations
and Lagrangians obtained by reduction from five dimensions. Since there
are ten distinct cases we have used a notation which permits us to condense
them into four distinct types. Details of computations, which can easily be
adapted from [16] have largely been omitted. After presenting the field representations and Lagrangians, we discuss which theories in a given signature
are equivalent.
Background material on Clifford algebras and γ-matrices has been relegated to Appendix A. Appendix B contains details of some computations,
which we have included for completeness.

Classification of Poincaré Lie superalgebras in
arbitrary dimension, signature and number of
supercharges

Consider the pseudo-Euclidean vector space V = Rt,s ∼
= Rt+s with its stanP
Pt
i i
dard scalar product hv, wi = − i=1 v i wi + t+s
i=t+1 v w . We denote by S

an arbitrary non-trivial module of the Clifford algebra Cl(V ), considered
as a module of the Lie algebra so(V ) ∼
= spin(V ), that is, an arbitrary sum
of irreducible spinor modules. Then γ : Cl(V ) → End S, a 7→ γa = γ(a),

denotes the corresponding Clifford representation. Let g = so(V ) + V + S

be the direct sum of the vector spaces so(V ), V , S. We endow g with the
Z2 grading g0 = so(V ) + V , g1 = S.
We consider on g = g0 + g1 all possible Lie superbrackets [·, ·] of the

following form:

[A, B] = AB − BA , [A, v] = Av , [v1 , v2 ] = 0 , [A, s] = A · s := ρS (A)s ,
8

[s1 , s2 ] = Π(s1 , s2 ) ∈ V ,
for all A, B ∈ so(V ), v, v1 , v2 ∈ V and s, s1 , s2 ∈ S, where ρS denotes the

spinorial representation of so(V ) on S and where Π ∈ (Sym2 S ∗ ⊗ V )Spin0 (V ) ,

is a symmetric, Spin0 -equivariant vector-valued bilinear form on S.

Such Lie superalgebras (g, [·, ·]) are called Poincaré Lie superalgebras. All

such brackets Π are linear combinations of brackets of the form Πβ , where
β is a super-admissible bilinear form on S [10]. Πβ is defined as follows:
hΠβ (s1 , s2 ) , vi = β(vs1 , s2 ) ,

(2.1)

for all s1 , s2 ∈ S, v ∈ V . The admissibility of the form β is defined by the
existence of σ, τ ∈ {±1}, called the symmetry, and the type of β, respectively,

such that

β(s1 , s2 ) = σβ(s2 , s1 ) ,
β(vs1 , s2 ) = τ β(s1 , vs2 ) ,

(2.2)

for all s1 , s2 ∈ S, v ∈ V . An admissible form is called super-admissible if
στ = 1. All admissible bilinear forms were described in [10]. In particular,
all the brackets Π defining Poincaré Lie superalgebras are known explicitly.
In general, the space of brackets is higher-dimensional and for a given
pair Π, Π′ ∈ (Sym2 S ∗ ⊗ V )Spin0 (V ) one needs to decide whether the cor-

responding Lie superalgebras (g, [·, ·] = [·, ·]Π ) and (g, [·, ·]′ = [·, ·]Π′ ) are

isomorphic. This is the classification problem for Poincaré Lie superalgebras up to isomorphism. In this section we explain how this problem can

be solved in general. In the next section we will apply the method in four
dimensions for the case where the spinorial module S is the complex spinor
module S, that is the representation on Dirac spinors, regarded as a real
representation.
Theorem 1

Assume that the signature (t, s) of V is different from (1, 1).

Two Poincaré Lie superalgebras (g, [·, ·]) and (g, [·, ·]′ ) are isomorphic if and
9

only if there exists ψ = ψ ′ · a ∈ Pin(V ) · C(S)∗ , where ψ ′ ∈ Pin(V ) and

a ∈ C(S)∗ , such that

Π′ (ψs1 , ψs2 ) = ϕ(Π(s1 , s2 )) ,

(2.3)

Π′ (ψs1 , ψs2 ) = −ϕ(Π(s1 , s2 )) ,

(2.4)

or

for all s1 , s2 ∈ S, where ϕ is the image of ψ ′ under the homomorphism

Ad : Pin(V ) → O(V ) induced by the adjoint representation of Pin(V ) on

V . Here C(S)∗ = ZGL(S) (spin(V )) denotes the group of invertible elements

of the Schur algebra C(S) = ZEnd(S) (spin(V )). The product Pin(V ) · C(S)∗

denotes the subgroup of GL(S) generated by Pin(V ) and C(S)∗ . (Notice that
Pin(V ) normalizes C(S)∗ .)

Proof: Every isomorphism φ : (g, [·, ·]) → (g, [·, ·]′ ) maps gi to gi , i = 0, 1.

It also maps V to V , since V is precisely the kernel of the representation

of g0 on g1 , which is induced by the adjoint representation of g with either
bracket. We define:
ϕ := φ|V ∈ GL(V ) , ψ := φ|S ∈ GL(S) .
It follows that φ induces an automorphism ξ of the quotient so(V ) =
(so(V ) + V )/V . Even more is true. The subalgebra φ(so(V )) ⊂ so(V ) + V

is conjugate to so(V ) by a translation, as follows from H 1 (so(V ), V ) = 0.
Therefore, up to composition of φ with the inner automorphism of (g, [·, ·]′ )
induced by the above translation, we can assume that φ(so(V )) = so(V ).
Now we can identify ξ = φ|so(V ) ∈ Aut(so(V )). Therefore φ is an isomorphism if and only if ξ, ϕ, ψ satisfy the following system of equations:
ξ(A)ϕ(v) = ϕ(Av) ,

(2.5)

ξ(A)ψ(s) = ψ(As) ,

(2.6)

10

and (2.3), for all A ∈ so(V ), v ∈ V and s1 , s2 ∈ S. Equation (2.5) determines

ξ ∈ Aut(so(V )) in terms of ϕ as ξ = Cϕ , where Cϕ : A 7→ ϕ◦A◦ϕ−1 denotes

the conjugation by ϕ. Now (2.5) is a condition solely on ϕ:

ϕ ∈ NGL(V ) (so(V )) = {A ∈ GL(V ) | A∗ h·, ·i = ±λh·, ·i,

λ > 0} .

Here we have used that a linear transformation which normalizes the Lie
algebra so(V ) (and therefore the group SO0 (V )) preserves the scalar product
up to a (possibly negative) factor, which is true for all signature (t, s) with
the exception of (t, s) = (1, 1). Note if t 6= s, the resulting group is precisely
the linear conformal group

CO(V ) = {A ∈ GL(V ) | A∗ h·, ·i = λh·, ·i,

λ > 0} = R∗ · O(V ),

since anti-isometries only exist if t = s. The next lemma shows that (2.6)
implies ϕ ∈ CO(V ) for all signatures (t, s) 6= (1, 1).
Lemma 1

Assume that t = s ≥ 2, and let ξ be the automorphism of

so(V ) induced by an anti-isometry ϕ ∈ GL(V ). Then there is no ψ ∈ GL(S)
normalizing the image of spin(V ) in End S and acting on spin(V ) ∼
= so(V )
as ξ.
Proof: Since the homomorphism Ad : Pin(V ) → O(V ) is surjective we can

assume without loss of generality that ϕ is given by ϕ(ei ) = e′i , ϕ(e′i ) = ei ,
where (e1 , . . . , et , e′1 , . . . , e′t ) is an orthonormal basis with time-like vectors
ei . Then ξ interchanges ei ej with −e′i e′j (i 6= j) and ei e′j with −e′i ej = ej e′i
(i, j arbitrary).

We proceed by induction starting with the case t = 2 (since the claim
is not true for t = 1). Without loss of generality we can assume that the
Clifford module S is irreducible. Then we can realize S in signature (2, 2)
as S = R2 ⊗ R2 , where γe1 = J ⊗ I, γe2 = K ⊗ I, γe′1 = 1 ⊗ J, γe′2 = 1 ⊗ K,
where I, J, K = IJ are pairwise anti-commuting operators on R2 such that

J2 = K2 =

1 = −I 2 . Then ξ preserves the elements J ⊗ K, K ⊗ J and
11

interchanges 1⊗I with −I ⊗1 and J ⊗J with −K⊗K. In fact, these elements

obtained by pairwise multiplying the above Clifford generators form a basis
of spin(V ). Now we can write ψ ∈ End(S) in the form
ψ = 1 ⊗ A0 + I ⊗ A1 + J ⊗ A2 + K ⊗ A3 ,

(2.7)

where Aa ∈ End(R2 ), a = 0, . . . , 3. Now one can easily solve the system of

equations

ψ ◦ (J ⊗ K) = (J ⊗ K) ◦ ψ,
ψ ◦ (1 ⊗ I) = −(I ⊗ 1) ◦ ψ,

ψ ◦ (K ⊗ J) = (K ⊗ J) ◦ ψ,
ψ ◦ (K ⊗ K) = −(J ⊗ J) ◦ ψ,

which corresponds to (2.6). We find that the only solution is ψ = 0, showing
that for t = 2 there is no ψ ∈ GL(S) with the desired properties.

To pass from t to t + 1 we write the irreducible Clifford module in sig-

nature (t + 1, t + 1) as S = R2 ⊗ (R2 )⊗n , where γei = J ⊗ Li , γe′i = J ⊗ L′i ,

γen+1 = I ⊗ 1, γe′ n+1 = K ⊗ 1 and Li , L′i are Clifford generators in signature
(t, t). Then we write ψ ∈ End(S) as (2.7), where now Aa ∈ End((R2 )⊗n ).
The equation (2.6) is now a system of equations for the Aa , which contains
the following equations:
Aa Li Lj = −L′i L′j Aa

(i 6= j),

Aa Li L′j = Lj L′i Aa

(2.8)

and also equations involving γen+1 and γe′ n+1 . By induction, the equations
(2.8) already imply Aa = 0. In fact, this system for a single A corresponds
to the equation (2.6) in signature (t, t).



Since a homothety with factor µ on S accompanied by µ2 on V defines
an automorphism of any Poincaré Lie superalgebra, we can assume that
ϕ ∈ O(V ). It is known that the homomorphism Ad : Pin(V ) → O(V )

is surjective for dim V even, while the image is SO(V ) if dim V is odd.
Irrespective of the dimension of V , there either exists ψ1 ∈ Pin(V ), with

Ad(ψ1 ) = ϕ, or there exists ψ2 ∈ Pin(V ) with Ad(ψ2 ) = −ϕ, or both. Any

such ψi solves equation (2.6), and all solutions are of this type.
12

This shows that ψ coincides, up to an element of the Schur group C(S)∗ ,

either with a pre-image ψ1 of ϕ or with a pre-image ψ2 of −ϕ under the

map Ad : Pin(V ) → O(V ). In the former case (2.3) holds, whereas in the

latter case the equation

Π′ (ψs1 , ψs2 ) = −ϕ̃(Π(s1 , s2 ))
holds, where ϕ̃ = −ϕ is the image of ψ under Ad : Pin(V ) → O(V ). Con-

versely, any solution (ψ, ϕ) of (2.3) or (2.4) defines an isomorphism from
(g, [·, ·] = [·, ·]Π ) to (g, [·, ·]′ = [·, ·]Π′ ) or from (g, [·, ·]−Π ) to (g, [·, ·]′ = [·, ·]Π′ ),

respectively. This proves the theorem since the Lie superalgebras (g, [·, ·]Π )

and (g, [·, ·]−Π ) are isomorphic. An isomorphism is given by (A, v, s) 7→

(A, −v, s).



The above theorem allows us to reduce the classification of Poincaré Lie

superalgebras up to isomorphism to the classification of the orbits

OΠ = C(S)∗ · Π ∪ C(S)∗ · γe1 · Π .
if V is definite or if V is indefinite and t, s are both odd.
Using Theorem 1 we obtain:
Corollary 1

Assume that dim V is even, with V ∼
6= R1,1 .

1. V is definite, or V is indefinite and t, s are odd. Then two Poincaré Lie
superalgebras (g, [·, ·] = [·, ·]Π ) and (g, [·, ·]′ = [·, ·]Π′ ) are isomorphic if

and only if Π, −Π, γe1 Π, or −γe1 Π is related to Π′ by an element of
the Schur group C(S)∗ .

2. V is indefinite and t, s are both even. Then two Poincaré Lie superalgebras (g, [·, ·] = [·, ·]Π ) and (g, [·, ·]′ = [·, ·]Π′ ) are isomorphic if and

only if Π, −Π, γe1 Π, −γe1 Π γet+s Π, −γet+s Π, γe1 et+s Π or −γe1 et+s Π,
is related to Π′ by an element of the Schur group C(S)∗ .

Remark 1 We will find in Section 3 that in dimension four, and for S = S
the complex spinor module, the element γe1 and γet+s in Proposition 1 and
Corollary 1 are not needed, that is OΠ = C(S)∗ · Π and two Poincaré Lie
superalgebras (g, [·, ·] = [·, ·]Π ) and (g, [·, ·]′ = [·, ·]Π′ ) are isomorphic if and
only if Π or −Π is related to Π′ by an element of the Schur group C(S)∗ .

Classification of Poincaré Lie superalgebras based
on four-dimensional Dirac spinors in arbitrary
signature

3.1

The general setting

Now we apply the method in four dimensions for the case where the spin(V )
module S is the complex spinor module S, regarded as a real module. According to Corollary 1, to classify the Poincaré Lie superalgebras in this
case, we need to determine first the Schur group C(S)∗ for all possible sig-

natures (t, s), t + s = 4, and classify the orbits of the Schur group on
(Sym2 S∗ ⊗ V )Spin0 (V ) . Then we need to determine the orbits of the involu-

tion induced by γe1 , and for t, s both even also of γe4 and γe1 γe4 , on this set
of orbits.

For reference, we will now list the Clifford algebras, spinor modules and
Schur algebras that are relevant in four dimensions. We use a notation
where K(N ) denotes the algebra of N × N matrices over K ∈ {R, C, H},

and where mK(N ) := K(N ) ⊕ · · · ⊕ K(N ) is the m-fold direct sum of the

algebras K(N ). The algebra mK(N ) has precisely m inequivalent irreducible
representations, given by the natural action of one factor K(N ) on KN , while

the other factors act trivially. Recall that all real Clifford algebras Ct,s are
isomorphic to matrix algebras of the form mK(N ), while all complex Clifford
algebas Cln are of the form mC(N ), where m ∈ {1, 2}. The same is true for

0 and Cl0 . It follows that Cl0 has either a
the even Clifford algebras Clt,s
n
t,s

unique irreducible module Σ (if m = 1), or precisely two irreducible modules
∼ Σ2 (if m = 2). The most general Cl0 module is of the form S = pΣ
Σ1 6=
t,s

or S = p1 Σ1 ⊕ p2 Σ2 , and the corresponding Schur algebra is C(S) = K(p) or
C(S) = K(p1 ) ⊕ K(p2 ). Similar results hold for Cln0 .

Now we specialize the discussion to four dimensions and the case where

S = S is the complex spinor module. We start with the complex Clifford
algebra Cl4 and its even subalgebra Cl40 , which are listed in Table 1.

algebras for all signatures that occur in four dimensions.

even subalgebras, the Schur algebras C(S) and C(SR ) of the complex and
real spinor module, and the relations between the complex and real spinor
modules S, SR and semi-spinor modules S± , SR± .
The real spinor module SR is the Spin(t, s)-module obtained by restricting an irreducible Clt,s -module. SR either irreducible or decomposes into
two irreducible real semi-spinor modules SR± , which may or may not be isomorphic to one another. The decide whether SR is reducible, we need to

only signature where real spinors are irreducible is (1, 3). In the remaining
cases real spinors decompose into real semi-spinors, SR = SR+ ⊕ SR− . The real
16

0 is simsemi-spinor modules are isomorphic if and only if the algebra Clt,s

ple. The relation between the complex spinor module S and the real spinor
module SR , and the relation between the complex semi-spinor modules S±

and real semi-spinor modules SR± follow by dimensional reasoning. We have

also listed the Schur algebras Ct,s (SR ) = ZGL(SR ) (spin(t, s)) = EndClt,s
0 (SR )

and Ct,s (S) = ZGL(S) (spin(t, s)) = EndClt,s
0 (S) of SR and S, where the latter

is considered as a real module. While the Schur algebras Ct,s (S) are relevant

for our classification problem, the Schur algebras Ct,s (SR ) are included for

comparison with Table 1 of [11].

Elements a ∈ Ct,s (S)∗ of the Schur group act on vector-valued bilinear

forms Π ∈ (Sym2 S∗ ⊗ Rt,s )Spin0 (t,s) by the contragradient (or dual) represen-

tation

(a, Π) 7→ Π′ = a · Π = Π(a−1 · , a−1 ·) .
By considering one-parameter subgroups a(u) = exp(uA), where A ∈ Ct,s (S)

is an element of the Schur algebra regarded as a Lie algebra, we obtain the
corresponding infinitesimal action
(A, Π) 7→ Π′ = A · Π := −Π(A·, ·) − Π(·, A·) .
Recall that if β is an admissible bilinear form on S, as defined in (2.2),
then the corresponding admissible vector-valued bilinear form Πβ is given by
(2.1). If β is an admissible bilinear form, then an endomorphism A ∈ End(S)
is called β-admissible if the following conditions hold:

1. Clifford multiplication either commutes or anti-commutes with A. The
type of A is τ (A) = 1 in the first case and τ (A) = −1 in the second.
2. A is either β-symmetric or β-skew. The β-symmetry of A is σβ (A) = 1
in the first case and σβ (A) = −1 in the second.
3. If S is reducible, S = S+ + S− , then either AS± ⊂ S± or AS± ⊂ S∓ .

The isotropy of A is ι(A) = 1 in the first case and ι(A) = −1 in the
second.

17

For reducible S we can also define the isotropy ι(β) of a bilinear form β
to be ι(β) = 1 if S± are mutually β-orthogonal, β(S± , S∓ ) = 0, and to be
ι(β) = −1 if S± are mutually β-isotropic, β(S± , S± ) = 0. A non-degenerate
admissible bilinear form automatically has a well defined isotropy.

It was shown in [10] that if β is admissible and if A is β-admissible, then
βA := β(A·, ·)
is admissible. Moreover, the space of Spin0 -invariant bilinear forms admits a
basis (βA1 , . . . , βAl ), consisting of admissible forms βAi , where Ai ∈ Ct,s (S),

i = 1, . . . , dim Ct,s (S) are the elements of a basis of the Schur algebra, and

where β is a non-degenerate admissible bilinear form [10]. The vector-valued

bilinear form ΠβA associated to the admissible bilinear form βA is symmetric,
and hence defines a Poincaré Lie superalgebra, if and only if βA is superadmissible, σ(βA )τ (βA ) = 1. Note that any basis of admissible forms will
split into two disjoint subsets, one consisting of super-admissible forms, the
other of admissible forms with σ(βA )τ (βA ) = −1.

The following short calculation shows that the infinitesimal action of the

Schur group on vector-valued bilinear forms can be expressed as an action
on the underlying bilinear forms:
hΠβ (As1 , s2 ) + Πβ (s1 , As2 ) , vi = β(γv As1 , s2 ) + β(γv s1 , As2 )
= (τ (A) + σβ (A))β(Aγv s1 , s2 ) = (τ (A) + σβ (A))βA (γv s1 , s2 )
= (τ (A) + σβ (A))hΠβA (s1 , s2 ), vi .
Therefore:
−A · Πβ = (τ (A) + σβ (A))ΠβA =

(

2τ (A)ΠβA ,

if τ (A)σβ (A) = 1 ,

0,

if τ (A)σβ (A) = −1 .

This shows that a β-admissible Schur algebra element only acts non-trivially
on a super-admissible form if it maps it to another super-admissible form.
The β-admissible Schur algebra elements A ∈ Ct,s (S) with σβ (A)τ (A) = −1
18

generate the connected component of the stabilizer (or isotropy group) of
Πβ ,
StabCt,s (S)∗ (Πβ ) = {a ∈ C(S)∗ |β(γv a·, a·) = β(γv ·, ·)} ⊂ Ct,s (S)∗ .
Up to conjugation the stabilizer only depends on the Ct,s (S)∗ -orbit of Πβ ,

and is therefore isomorphic for all superbrackets which define isomorphic
Poincaré Lie superalgebras.

We define the R-symmetry group GR of a

Poincaré Lie superalgebra with bracket Π as GR = StabCt,s (S)∗ (Π).

3.2

Minkowski signature

Minkowski signature can be realised either with the mostly plus convention,
(t, s) = (1, 3) or with the mostly minus convention (t, s) = (3, 1). While
the Clifford algebras Cl1,3 ∼
= R(4) and Cl3,1 ∼
= H(2) are distinct, the even

0 ∼ C(2) ∼ Cl0 , and hence the resulting Spin (1, 3)Clifford algebras Cl1,3
=
= 3,1
0

and Spin0 (3, 1)- representations are equivalent. Since also the Schur algebras
C1,3 (S) ∼
= C(2) ∼
= C3,1 (S) are the same, the classification of Schur group

orbits, and hence of Poincaré Lie superalgebras will not depend on which

convention we use for the signature. For definiteness we will work in the
mostly plus convention, (t, s) = (1, 3). Our conventions for Clifford algebras
are summarized in Appendix A.
A convenient model of S for signature (1, 3) can be constructed by taking
tensor products of real factors R2 , using that the real Clifford algebra can
be realised as a product: Cl1,3 ≃ Cl0,2 ⊗ Cl1,1 ≃ R(2) ⊗ R(2) ≃ R(4). We
define:

I=

1

0

0 −1

!

, J=

0 1
1 0

!

, K = IJ =

0

−1 0

.

Note that I and J are two anticommuting involutions, so that their product
K is a complex structure anticommuting with I, J. Combined with the 2× 2
identity matrix

1 = 12 they generate the real algebra R(2), which can be

identified with the algebra H′ of para-quaternions, see Appendix B of [12].
19

Clifford generators can be realised as follows:
γ0 = K ⊗ I , γ1 = I ⊗ 1 , γ2 = J ⊗ 1 , γ3 = K ⊗ K .
These generators act on the real spinor module SR ≃ R4 ≃ R2 ⊗ R2 . The
corresponding spin(1, 3) representation is real and corresponds to Majorana

spinors. We could proceed to construct a Poincaré Lie superalgebra of the
form g = so(1, 3) + R1,3 + SR , which in physics terminology is the N =

1 supersymmetry algebras based on Majorana spinors, and which is the
minimal supersymmetry algebra in signature (1, 3). But our main interest
is to classify Poincaré Lie superalgebras of the from g = so(1, 3) + R1,3 + S,

that is N = 2 supersymmetry algebra where the supercharges form a Dirac

spinor. We will see later that in our description the N = 1 supersymmetry
algebra corresponds to a special (higher co-dimension) orbit of the Schur
group. We now proceed with the N = 2 case and therefore consider two
copies of the real spinor module

SR ⊕ SR ≃ SR ⊗ R 2
which we identify with the complex spinor module by equipping the additional factor R2 with the complex structure K:
S ≃ SR ⊗ C , C ≃ (R2 , K) .
Real bilinear forms on S can be constructed as tensor products of bilinear
forms on the three factors R2 . On each factor R2 we use the following basis
of bilinear forms: g is the standard positive definite symmetric bilinear form,
with representing matrix the identity. Then we use I, J, K to define:
η = g(I·, ·) = g(·, I·) ,

η ′ = g(J·, ·) = g(·, J·) ,
ǫ = g(K·, ·) = −g(·, K·) .
20

The symmetric bilinear forms η and η ′ have split signature, while the antisymmetric bilinear form ǫ is the Kähler form associated to the metric g and
complex structure K.
For later use, we list the symmetry σβ (A) of the endomorphisms A =

1, I, J, K with respect to the bilinear forms β = g, η, η′ , ǫ in Table 3.

By inspection, K ⊗ J and

0 . Since (K ⊗ J)2 = −1 the Schur algebra of the real spinor module is
Cl1,3

C(SR ) = h1 ⊗ 1 , K ⊗ Jialgebra ≃ C .
The action of the above Clifford and spin generators is trivially extended, by
taking the tensor product with
spinor module S =

1 acting on the third factor, to the complex

⊗ R2 . Therefore, as in Table 2

C(S) = C(SR ) ⊗ R(2) ∼
= C ⊗ R(2) ≃ C(2) .
The simple algebra C(2) contains both the quaternions H and the paraquaternions (aka split-quaternions) H′ ≃ R(2) as subalgebras, due to the

following isomorphisms of real algebras:

C ⊗ H′ ≃ C(2) ≃ C ⊗ H .
21

A subalgebra of C(2) isomorphic to H′ is
h1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ I , 1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ J , 1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ Kialgebra ,
and a subalgebra isomorphic to H is
hK ⊗ J ⊗ I , K ⊗ J ⊗ J , 1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ Kialgebra .
These subalgebras do not commute, and they intersect on the subalgebra
h1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ 1, 1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ Ki ∼
= C.
We introduce

γ∗ := iγ0 γ1 γ2 γ3 , γ∗2 = 1 ,
which is, up to sign, the real volume element of Cl1,3 , see Appendix A. In
our model
γ∗ = −K ⊗ J ⊗ K ,
where the last factor corresponds to multiplication by ‘i’ with our choice of
complex structure on S. The eigenspaces of γ∗ are the complex semi-spinor
modules S± , whose elements are the Weyl spinors.

To determine the super-admissible bilinear forms on S ∼
= R2 ⊗ R2 ⊗ R2 ,

we start by identifying those bilinear forms on SR which have a definite
type. Out of the sixteen basic forms, only the two listed in Table 4 qualify.
Since the Spin group does not act on the third factor R2 , we obtain super-

in a basis of four super-admissible forms on S, which are listed with their

element Id generates a subgroup R>0 of the Schur group which acts by rescalings. The element I = K ⊗ J ⊗ 1 stabilizes all four super-admissible
forms, which implies that the lower half of the table is obtained from the
upper half by flipping signs. Together Id and I generate the center C∗ of
the Schur group C(S)∗ = GL(2, C).

Let us first study the action of the subgroup SL(2, C) which is the uni-

versal cover of the connected Lorentz group SO(1, 3)0 . This has two (real-)
inequivalent four-dimensional representations, the vector representation and
the (Weyl) spinor representation. The latter has only one open orbit. To
show that we have at least two open orbits, we compute the stabilizer groups
of the forms Πβi , by reading off from the above tables which endomorphisms
act trivially, see Table 8.
Since Πβ0 has a compact stabilizer, while Πβa , a = 1, 2, 3 have noncompact stabilizers, we have at least two open orbits, which implies that

SL(2, C) operates in the vector representation.1 In fact, the non-abelian
factors are precisely the stabilizers so(3) ≃ su(2) and so(2, 1) ≃ su(1, 1)

of time-like and space-like vectors under the action of the Lorentz group.
It follows that there are at least two non-isomorphic N = 2 superalgebras
with R-symmetry groups which are isomorphic to U(2) = U(1) · SU(2) and

U(1, 1) = U(1) · SU(1, 1).

Since U(1) ⊂ C(S)∗ acts trivially, we see that C(S)∗ acts as the linear con-

formal pseudo-orthogonal group CSO0 (1, 3) := R>0 × SO0 (1, 3) on the space

of superbrackets, which we can identify with four-dimensional Minkowski
space R1,3 by choosing the spin-invariant scalar product for which the Πβi

form an orthonormal basis. The Schur group C(S)∗ acts with six orbits:
the three open orbits of time-like future-directed, time-like past-directed

and space-like vectors, the two three-dimensional orbits of non-zero null future or past-directed vectors, and the origin. Since the superbrackets Πβ
and Π−β define isomorphic Poincaré Lie superalgebras, there are only four
non-isomorphic Poincaré Lie superalgebra structures, distinguished by the
isomorphism type of their stabilizers in the Schur group:
1. The time-like orbits of Π±β0 define isomorphic supersymmetry algebras
with non-degenerate superbrackets and R-symmetry group U(2). This
is the standard N = 2 superalgebra.
1

It is straightforward to work out the explicit matrix representation, which is indeed
the vector representation of SO0 (1, 3). In the following we will not need an explicit matrix
representation.

25

2. The space-like orbit, which contains Πβa , a = 1, 2, 3, defines a supersymmetry algebra with non-degenerate superbracket and R-symmetry
group U(1, 1). This is a non-standard ‘twisted’ N = 2 supersymme-

try algebra similar to the twisted supersymmetry algebra of type-II∗
string theories.

3. The orbits generated by null vectors correspond to isomorphic supersymmetry algebras with partially degenerate superbrackets. Without
loss of generality, we can consider the bracket Π 1 (β0 +β1 ) . We note that
1
2 (β0

± := 2 (1 ± E1 ) are

projection operators onto the eigenspaces of E1 with eigenvalues ±1.

The bilinear form Π 1 (β0 +β1 ) has the four-dimensional kernel Π−
S and

SR = ΠE
+ S. The isotropy group of this bracket in the Schur group

C ∗ (SR ) = C∗ is the U(1) generated by IE1 . Since in our classification

there is no other non-trivial supersymmetry bracket with a non-trivial
kernel, this supersymmetry algebra must be the standard N = 1 supersymmetry algebra.

4. The zero vector defines a completely degenerate superbracket corresponding to the trivial supersymmetry algebra.

3.3

Neutral signature

In signature (2, 2) the real Clifford algebra is Cl2,2 ∼
= R(4), and the real
spinor module is SR = R4 , which will allow us to use a real model similar to
signature (1, 3). Since the even real Clifford algebra is 2R(2), real spinors

modules, hence of real type, and self-conjugate as complex Cl2,2

In physics terminology, elements of SR , S± and SR± are Majorana spinors,
Weyl spinors and Majorana-Weyl spinors respectively. Due to the absence
of invariant quaternionic structures on S, we cannot define symplectic Majorana spinors. The Majorana condition allows one to define an N = 1

superalgebra, which we will recover when classifying the orbits of the Schur
group. The existence of Majorana-Weyl spinors is consistent with the existence of an even smaller ‘N = 1/2’ superalgebra, which would be chiral in
the sense of only involving superbrackets between supercharges of the same
chirality. We will be able to decide later whether such a supersymmetry
algebra exists.
As in signature (1, 3) we take S ∼
= R2 ⊗ R2 and S ∼
= R2 ⊗ R2 ⊗ R2 . On

where now I is a complex structure on R2 , while J, K are involutions. Since
I, J, K anti-commute they satisfy the para-quaternionic algebra, making
manifest that R(2) ≃ H′ as associative algebras, where H′ is the algebra

of para-quaternions.

On R2 we choose the following basis of bilinear forms: g0 = g, g1 =
gI, g2 = gJ, g3 = gK, where g is the standard symmetric positive definite
bilinear form, and where gI = g(I·, ·), etc. The symmetry of these basic

bilinear forms is listed in Table 9 together with the gi -symmetry of the basic
endomorphisms.

Note that this basis is different from the one we used for signature (1, 3) in Section

3.2.

γ2 γ3 = K ⊗ K , γ2 γ4 = −K ⊗ J , γ3 γ4 = −1 ⊗ I .

By inspection, the only endomorphisms commuting with the spin generators
are linear combinations of 1 ⊗ 1 and I ⊗ I. The Schur algebra of the real

Generators of the Schur algebra C(S) are obtained by tensoring the two

generators of C(SR ) with the four basic endomorphisms acting on the third
factor R2 . In other words we have the following direct decomposition of

vector spaces:
C(S) = (1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ H′ ) ⊕ (I ⊗ I ⊗ H′ ) ,
where H′ = h1, I, J, Ki. To obtain a decomposition C(S) = C(S)+ ⊕ C(S)− ∼

We choose the basis vi = Πβi , i = 1, 2, 3, 4 in the space of superbrackets. The
infinitesimal action of the generators of the Schur algebra on superbrackets
is summarized in table 12. It preserves the scalar product on the space of

In table 12 Rij denotes the rotation by 90 degrees in the plane spanned

full, non-connected Schur group

C(S)∗ = GL(2, R) × GL(2, R) = (R>0 × SL± (2, R)) × (R>0 × SL± (2, R))
where SL± (2, R) is the subgroup of GL(2, R) consisting of matrices A with
| det(A)| = 1, it suffices to determine the action of the two group elements

P− + J+ and P+ + J− on the four-dimensional space of Lie superbrackets.
In fact these two elements generate a subgroup Z2 × Z2 of the Schur group

which acts simply transitively on the four components of the Schur group.
A straightforward calculation shows that P− + J+ interchanges v1 and v2
as well as v3 and −v4 . Similarly P+ + J− interchanges v1 and v2 as well

as v3 and v4 . This implies that the image of the Schur group under the

representation on the four-dimensional space of superbrackets is precisely
CO0 (2, 2) ∪ ξCO0 (2, 2), where ξ = P+ + J− is the involution which maps v1
to v2 and v3 to v4 , and

CO0 (2, 2) = R>0 × SO0 (2, 2) = R>0 × SL(2, R) · SL(2, R)
is the connected component of the identity of the conformal linear group.
30

Note that ξ is an anti-isometry and therefore interchanges space-like and
time-like vectors.
The action of the connected group CO0 (2, 2) has four orbits: the two
open orbits of time-like and space-like vectors separated by the lightcone,
the three-dimensional orbit of non-zero null vectors, and the origin. The
two open orbits cannot be distinguished by the isomorphism type of their
stabilizers, which are CO0 (2, 1) ∼
= CO0 (1, 2) = R>0 × SO0 (1, 2). Under the

full Schur group there are only three orbits since the orbits of time-like and
space-like vectors are mapped to each other by ξ. The open orbit of the
full Schur group corresponds to a unique N = 2 supersymmetry algebra in
signature (2, 2). The connected R-symmetry group is R>0 × Spin (1, 2) ∼
=
0

R>0 × SL(2, R).

Note that Spin0 (1, 2) ⊂ Spin0 (2, 2) ∼
= SL(2, R) × SL(2, R) is

a diagonally embedded SL(2, R)-subgroup of the maximally connected Schur
group C(S)∗0 = GL+ (2, R) × GL+ (2, R).

Consider next the orbit of non-zero null vectors. Without restriction of

Since J 2 = 1, the operators ΠJ± = 12 (1 ⊗ 1 ⊗(1 +J)) are projection operators
onto the eigenspaces ΠJ± S of

1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ J with eigenvalues ±1. Since 1 ⊗

1 ⊗ J commutes with the Clifford generators, the vector-valued bilinear
form Π 1 (β1 +β2 ) has a four-dimensional kernel ΠJ− S and defines a non-trivial
2

Poincaré Lie superalgebra with spinor module SR = ΠJ+ S. Therefore there is
a unique N = 1 supersymmetry algebra in signature (2, 2). Its connected Rsymmetry group, that is the stabilizer of Π 1 (β1 +β2 ) in the identity component
2

of the Schur group C(SR )∗ , is the group SO0 (1, 1) generated by I ⊗ I ⊗ J.
The volume element ω of the Clifford algebra is3

ω = −γ∗ = γ1 γ2 γ3 γ4 = I ⊗ I .
3

The definition of γ∗ includes a minus sign, which is needed for consistency with our
conventions for dimensional reduction in later sections.

31

All four super-admissible bilinear forms βi have isotropy ι(βi ) = 1, that is
βi (S± , S∓ ) = 0. Since ω anti-commutes with the Clifford generators, the
corresponding vector valued bilinear forms are isotropic, Πβi (S± , S± ) = 0.

This implies that one cannot define a non-trivial ‘N = 12 ’ supersymmetry
algebra where the independent supercharges form a single Majorana-Weyl
spinor. This also follows from our classification of orbits.

3.4

Euclidean signature

In signature (0, 4) the real Clifford algebra is Cl0,4 = H(2) and the real spinor
module is SR = H2 ∼
= C4 . This shows that SR carries a quaternionic, and
therefore a complex structure, and is equal to the complex spinor module,
0 = 2H, the real spinor module
SR = S. Since the even Clifford algebra is Cl0,4

decomposes into two inequivalent real semi-spinor modules, SR = SR+ + SR− ,
6 SR− , which coincide with the complex semi-spinor modules, SR± = S± .
SR+ ∼
=

The semi-spinor modules carry a quaternionic structure, and therefore are
self-conjugate as complex modules, S± ∼
= S± . The complex spinor module is
also self-conjugate, S ∼
= S. Since the semi-spinor modules are not equivalent
the Schur algebra of S = SR is
C(S) = C(SR ) = 2H .
Due to the absence of an invariant real structure, there are no Majorana
spinors. The existence of an invariant quaternionic structure allows us to
rewrite a Dirac spinor as a pair of symplectic Majorana spinors, and since the
quaternionic structure preserves chirality (maps S± to S± ), Weyl spinors can
be rewritten as pairs of symplectic Majorana-Weyl spinors. Since Cl0,4 ∼
=
Cl4,0 , we do not need to consider signature (4, 0) explicitly.
Since Cl0,4 is a quaternionic matrix algebra, we will use a different type
of model than for the other signatures. We define the following operators
on H2 :
(Ia )a=0,1,2,3 = (Id, Ri , Rj , Rk ) , (Ia′ )a=0,1,2,3 = (Id, Li , Lj , Lk ) ,
32

where Rq , Lq , with q ∈ H denotes right and left multiplication by quater-

nions, respectively. We also introduce the following matrix operators which
act on H2 from the left:
D=

0

1

1 0

!

,

E=

1

0

0 −1

!

.

We note that Ia , Ia′ span quaternionic algebras which commute with each
other and with D, E. The operators D and E are two anti-commuting
involutions,
D 2 = Id , E 2 = Id and {D, E} = 0 ,
and therefore their product is a complex structure, (DE)2 = −Id, which

anti-commutes with D and E. Hence they generate an algebra isomorphic
to the para-quaternionic algebra H′ ∼
= R(2).
It is straightforward to verify that
γ α = IDIα′ , α = 1, 2, 3 , γ 4 = IDE ,
where I = I1 , satisfy the relations of generators for Cl0,4 . The generators
γ 1 γ 2 = −Lk , γ 1 γ 3 = Lj , γ 1 γ 4 = −Li E , γ 2 γ 3 = −Li ,

γ 2 γ 4 = −Lj E , γ 3 γ 4 = −Lk E

of spin(4) act diagonally on H2 . We also note that the Cl0,4 volume element
γ∗ = γ 1 γ 2 γ 3 γ 4 = −E

(3.1)

is proportional to the identity on the factors of S = SR = H + H, which are
±
therefore the semi-spinor modules S±
R = SR = H.

We remark that by adding γ 0 = IE, we obtain a set of generators for
the five-dimensional Clifford algebra Cl1,4 , which is associated to a theory
in signature (1, 4). By dimensional reduction over time one can then obtain
a theory in signature (0, 4) [16]. The model used in this paper differs from
the one used in [16] by exchanging D and E. The representation used in
33

the present paper is a ‘Weyl’ representation where the volume element acts
diagonally on SR = SR+ + SR− .
We now turn to the construction of admissible bilinear forms. On SR =
H + H we obtain a non-degenerate spin(4)-invariant positive definite scalar
product g by taking the direct sum of the standard scalar products on the
factors. The group Spin (4) ∼
= SU(2) × SU(2) acts isometrically on H2 by
0

left multiplication, while the Schur algebra

C(S) = C(SR ) = hIa , Ia E|a = 0, 1, 2, 3i ∼
= 2H
acts by multiplication from the right. On each factor S± ∼
= H, Lq and Rq
with q = i, j, k are isometries of the standard scalar product, and therefore
leave the scalar product g on H2 invariant. Since L2q = −1, these operators
are g-skew. D and E are isometries of g, but since they are involutions,

they are g-symmetric. The Clifford generators act isometrically with respect to g, and since they are involutions, (γ α )2 = Id = (γ 4 )2 , they are
g-symmetric. Hence g is super-admissible: σg = τg = 1. To obtain a basis
of admissible forms for the space of Spin(4)-invariant real bilinear forms,
we take gA := g(A·, ·), where A runs over a basis of the Schur algebra

which consists of admissible endomorphisms. To show that we can choose

{Ia , Ia E|a = 0, 1, 2, 3} as such a basis, we compute the g-symmetry and type

of these endomorphisms. Obviously the complex structures Iα are g-skew,

wheras D and E are g-symmetric. Since Iα and E commute, σg (Iα E) = −1.
With regard to the type we note that I = I1 commutes with γ α = IDIα′

and γ 4 = IDE, while I2,3 anticommute: τ (I1 ) = 1, τ (I2,3 ) = −1. Since E

anticommutes with D it anticommutes with γ α and γ 4 : τ (E) = −1, and
τ (I1 E) = −1, τ (I2,3 E) = 1. See Table 13 for a summary.

Using that with σg = τg = 1 we have σ(gA ) = σg σg (A) = σg (A) and

τ (gA ) = τg τ (A) = τ (A), it follows from the table that all eight forms are
admissible, and that four of them, namely
{βi |i = 1, 2, 3, 4} = {g , g(I2 ·, ·) , g(I3 ·, ·) , g(EI1 ·, ·)}

CSO(4) := R>0 × SO(4)

once we remove the origin. Therefore there are two orbits: the open orbit of non-zero vectors and the origin. There is one non-zero superbracket

We close this section by showing explicitly how each of the brackets

Πβi , i = 1, 2, 3 can be obtained from Πβ0 = Πg . This amounts to finding
A ∈ C(S)∗ such that
A−1 · Πg = Πg (A·, A·) = Πgf (A)
with f (A) = I2 , I3 , EI1 . We consider invertible elements of the Schur algebra
of the form
A = aId + bI1 E + cI2 + dI3 , a2 + b2 + c2 + d2 6= 0 .
We compute
g(γv As, At) = (a2 − b2 − c2 − d2 )g(γv s, t) − 2abg(I1 Eγv s, t)
−2acg(I2 γv s, t) − 2adg(I3 γv s, t) ,
using the symmetry and type of the various automorphisms. This determines:
f:

A = aId + bI1 E + cI2 + dI3
7→ f (A) = (a2 − b2 − c2 − d2 )Id − 2abI1 E − 2acI2 − 2adI3 .

Now we can read off how to obtain the basis Πβi by action with elements of
the Schur group on Πg , see Table 16. Note that the overall sign of A is free,
since we insert it twice into the bilinear form.
We remark that the semi-spinor modules are g-orthogonal, g(S± , S∓ ) =

0. Since the operators EI1 , I2 , I3 commute with the volume element γ 1 γ 2 γ 3 γ 4 =
−E, all superbrackets vanish on S+ ⊗ S+ + S− ⊗ S− .

Relating the five- and four-dimensional Poincaré
Lie superalgebras

Our goal in the remaining sections of this paper is to obtain vector multiplet
representations for the N = 2 supersymmetry algebras we have classified in
the previous section. This will be done by dimensional reduction of the five-

dimensional off-shell vector multiplets constructed in [12]. In preparation
for this we will investigate in this section how the super-admissible bilinear
forms underlying five- and four-dimensional supersymmetry algebras with
spinor module S can be expressed in physicist’s notation, and how they are
related to each other by dimensional reduction. Our conventions for Clifford
algebras and γ-matrices are summarized in Appendix A.

4.1

Super-admissible bilinear forms on S and the associated
Schur algebras

On the complex spinor module S one can always find matrices A and C
which relate the γ-matrices to the Hermitian conjugate and transposed γmatrices, respectively, as in A.1. The matrices A and C in turn define on S
the Dirac sesquilinear form
A(λ, χ) = λ† Aχ
and the complex Majorana bilinear form
C(λ, χ) = λT Cχ .
38

Both forms are Spin0 (t, s)-invariant, and their real and imaginary parts define four real admissible bilinear forms Re(A), Im(A), Re(C) and Im(C).
The forms A and C are independent of the representation which we choose
for the γ-matrices, up to conventional signs or phase factors which we have
fixed for convenience by imposing certain conditions on the γ-matrices, see
Appendix A for details. The Dirac sesquilinear form depends on the signature, while the Majorana bilinear form only depends on the dimension.
In even dimensions we can define four additional real admissible bilinear
forms by inserting the chirality matrix γ∗ into one argument of the above
four bilinear forms. For Re(C) and Im(C) this is equivalent to replacing the
charge conjugation matrix C by the second inequivalent charge conjugation
matrix γ∗ C, which has opposite type, τ (γ∗ C) = −τ (C). Therefore there are

at most eight linearly independent real admissible bilinear forms on S that
can be built out of A, C, γ∗ .

In five dimensions there is a unique real super-admissible bilinear form on
S, which can be taken to be Re(A) for t = 0, 1, 4, 5 and Im(A) for t = 2, 3 [12].
In four dimensions the eight bilinear forms constructed above are linearly
independent and therefore form a basis for the eight-dimensional space of
real Spin0 (t, s)-invariant bilinear forms on S.
On S we can also define a matrix B, which relates the γ-matrices to
the complex-conjugated γ-matrices, (A.1),(A.2). It satisfies BB ∗ = ǫ1,
with ǫ ∈ {±1} depending on the signature. Therefore it either defines

a Spin0 (t, s)-invariant real structure (for ǫ = 1) or a Spin0 (t, s)-invariant
quaternionic structure (for ǫ = −1) on S. Defining the complex anti-linear
map

(ǫ)(α)

JS

(λ) = α∗ B ∗ λ∗ ,

where α ∈ C is a phase factor, |α| = 1, we find
) = ǫ1 ⇔ BB ∗ = ǫ1 .

(ǫ)(α) 2

(JS

The phase α reflects that the equations (A.2) are invariant under phase
39

transformations B 7→ αB. We have fixed this invariance by the conven-

tional choice B = (CA−1 )T , but we will find it convenient to adjust reality
conditions using the phase factor α.

We denote by I the natural complex structure of S which acts through
multiplication by the imaginary unit i. In the case ǫ = −1 the anti-linear

map J (−1)(α) defines a second complex structure on S which anticommutes
with I. Therefore I, J (−1)(α) generate an algebra isomorphic to the quaternion algebra H, and commutes with the Spin0 (t, s) representation. This
explains why one says that J (−1)(α) defines a quaternionic structure on S.
Similarly, for ǫ = 1 the real structure J (+1)(α) anticommutes with I, and
therefore I and J (+1)(α) generate an algebra isomorphic to R(2), which can
be interpreted as the algebra of para-quaternions, H′ ∼
= R(2), see the appendix of [12] for details. Therefore we will say that J (+1)(α) defines a
para-quaternionic structure on S, and treating both cases in parallel we will
also say that J (ǫ)(α) defines an ǫ-quaternionic structure on S.
Also note that if we consider S as a real module, then J (ǫ)(α) provides
it with a complex structure for ǫ = −1 and with a para-complex structure

for ǫ = 1.4 To treat both cases in parallel we will say that J (ǫ)(α) defines an
ǫ-complex structure.
In five dimensions S is C-irreducible. The natural complex structure I
and the Spin0 (t, s)-invariant ǫ-quaternionic structure J (ǫ)(α) already generate the full Schur algebra
C(S) = Hǫ :=

(

H−1 := H ,
H+1 := H′ ∼
= R(2) ,

as can be seen by comparison to Table 17. Note that the Schur algebra Ct,s (S)

0 ). The complex spinor module S is Cis determined by the pair (Clt,s , Clt,s

irreducible in any odd dimension, and by comparison to the classification
4

A para-complex structure is a product structure, that is an endomorphism J of the
tangent bundle such that J 2 = 1, with the additional property that the eigenspaces of J
have equal dimension at each point. See [16] for details.

of Clifford algebras, all types of pairs which are possible already appear in
Table 17. Therefore the Schur algebra Ct,s (S) is equal to either H or to
H′ ∼
= R(2) in any odd dimension.
In four dimensions S decomposes into two C-irreducible complex semispinor modules S± , which are the eigenspaces of γ∗ . And there exist two
C-matrices C± of opposite type τ (C∓ ) = ±1, which are related though
multiplication by γ∗ , that is, C± = γ∗ C∓ . Associated to these are two

B-matrices B± , which define either two quaternionic structures, two real
structures or one quaternionic and one real structure. It is easy to see that
the two structures are of the same type if B± commutes with γ∗ and of
opposite type if B± anticommutes with γ∗ . The relevant relations between
C± , B± and γ∗ have been collected in (A.4) – (A.6). We will refer to ǫquaternionic structures which commute with γ∗ as Weyl compatible and to
ǫ-quaternionic structures which anti-commute with γ∗ as Weyl-incompatible.
In four dimensions the following cases occur:
1. Signatures (0, 4) and (4, 0). B± both define quaternionic structures,
and generate, together with the natural complex structure I of S the

41

full Schur algebra C0,4 (S) = C4,1 (S) = H ⊕ H. In these signatures it is

possible to define two different types of symplectic Majorana spinors,
which can be decomposed into symplectic Majorana-Weyl spinors.
Due to the absence of a Spin(t, s)-invariant real structure it is not
possible to define Majorana spinors. Consequently the N = 2 super-

symmetry algebra based on the complex spinor module is minimal,
that is, there is no smaller N = 1 supersymmetry algebra, as we also
have seen by classifying the orbits of the Schur group.

2. Signatures (1, 3) and (3, 1). B− defines a quaternionic structure and
B+ defines a real structure. Together with the natural complex structure I they generate the full Schur algebra C1,3 (S) = C3,1 (S) = C(2),

which contains a subalgebra isomorphic to H generated by I, B− and a

subalgebra isomorphic to H′ generated by I, B+ . The centre C ⊂ C(2)

is generated by Iγ∗ . We can define symplectic Majorana spinors, and
also Majorana spinors, but neither of these conditions is compatible
with imposing a chirality condition. The existence of Majorana spinors
allows the existence of a smaller N = 1 supersymmetry algebra, which
in our model is associated to the light-like orbit of the Schur group.

3. Signature (2, 2). B± both define real structures, and generate, together with the natural complex structure I the full Schur algebra
C2,2 (S) = R(2) ⊕ R(2) ∼
= H′ ⊕ H′ . We can define two types of Majorana spinors, but no symplectic Majorana spinors. The existence

of Majorana spinors allows the existence of a smaller, N = 1 super-

symmetry algebra, which in our model is associated to the light-like

orbit of the Schur group. Since the Majorana conditions are Weylcompatible, Majorana-Weyl spinors exist. However, there is no associated ‘N = 1/2’ supersymmetry algebra, since superbrackets are
isotropic and pair supercharges of opposite chirality.
We remark that in any even dimension two C-matrices of opposite type ex42

ist, giving rise to two inequivalent B-matrices, for which our classification of
ǫ-quaternionic structures is exhaustive. Thus in any even dimension I, B±

generate algebras isomorphic to either 2H or C(2) or 2H′ . Moreover, the

0 ) and a compariSchur algebra Ct,s (S) is determined by the pair (Clt,s , Clt,s

son of Table 2 to the classification of Clifford algebras shows that all possible
combinations already occur in four dimensions. Thus I, B− , B+ generate the
full Schur algebra Ct,s (S) in any even dimension.

4.2

Dimensional reduction of super-admissible bilinear forms
on S

The Spin0 (t, s)-invariant sesquilinear form A(t,s) (·, ·) on the Dirac spinor

module S(t,s) in 5 = t + s dimensions, which is unique up to scale, is
Spin0 (t′ , s′ )-invariant for all t′ , s′ with t′ + s′ = 4 and t′ ≤ t, s′ ≤ s.5

In this section we will relate this form to the classification of Spin0 (t′ , s′ )invariant forms in four dimensions. To do this it is sufficient to express the
corresponding endomorphism A(t,s) as a product of four-dimensional gamma
matrices, and then to compare the result with the latter classification.
To distinguish the five- and four-dimensional γ-matrices we denote the
γ-matrices generating Cl0,5 by Γ1 , . . . , Γ5 , while four-dimensional γ-matrices
will be denoted γµ . We use a representation where Γ1 · · · Γ5 =
obtain γ-matrices for the other signatures we define

Γ′i

1. To

:= −iΓi .

Our

standard γ-matrices for Cl1,4 are Γ′1 , Γ2 , . . . , Γ5 , and for the other signatures we proceed analogously, by replacing the space-like γ-matrices Γi by
their time-like counterparts Γ′i . Time-like dimensional reductions are always carried out over the 1-direction, while space-like reductions are carried
out over the 5-direction. In five dimensions the unique (up to normalization) super-admissible bilinear form on S(t,s) is given by the real part of
the Dirac sesquilinear form for t = 0, 1, 4, 5 and by its imaginary part for
t = 2, 3. Let h(ψ, φ) = ψ † φ be the standard sesquilinear form on S ∼
= C4 .
5

Whenever we need to keep track of the signature, we denote the complex spinor
module associated with the real Clifford algebra Clt,s by S(t,s) .

43

The Dirac sesquilinear from is A(t,s) (·, ·) = h(·, A(t,s) ·), where A(t,s) denotes
both the A-matrix in signature (t, s), and the associated Spin0 (t, s)-invariant

sesquilinear form. By expressing A(t,s) in terms of γ-matrices representing
the four-dimensional Clifford algebra Clt′ ,s′ , where t′ +s′ = 4, we can rewrite
A(t,s) (·, ·) as a Spin (t′ , s′ )-invariant sesquilinear form on S(t′ ,s′ ) ∼
= C4 , and
0

either its real or its imaginary part is a super-admissible real bilinear form β

defining a four-dimensional supersymmetry algebra. Writing β in the form
β = g(·, Φ·), where Φ ∈ End(St′ ,s′ ), and where g is the standard symmet-

ric positive definite bilinear form on R4 ⊂ C4 , allows us to compare with

the tables in Section 3, so that we can express the super-admissible bilinear
forms β = g(·, Φ·) obtained by dimensional reduction in the bases chosen
there. Since models with flipped signatures are equivalent, we only need to
consider reductions to the signatures (0, 4), (1, 3) and (2, 2).
4.2.1

Reduction (0, 5) → (0, 4)

We relate the five-dimensional and four-dimensional γ-matrices according to
γ i = γi = Γi for i = 1, 2, 3, 4. The chirality matrix is γ∗ = Γ5 = γ1 · · · γ4 =

−E, where E is the generator defined in Section 3.4, see equation (3.1) Only

a space-like reduction is possible, and since A(0,5) = 1, the super-admissible
form is the standard bilinear form:
ReA(0,5) (·, ·) = Re h = g = β1 ,
where β1 is the first element of our basis of super-admissible forms for signature (0, 4).
4.2.2

Reduction (1, 4) → (0, 4)

We relate the γ-matrices by γ i = γi = Γi+1 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4. The A-matrix
is A(1,4) = Γ′1 = −iΓ1 = −iγ1 · · · γ4 . In the model for signature (0, 4) given

in Section 3.4, γ1 · · · γ4 = γ 1 · · · γ 4 operates as −E, and multiplication by i
operates as I = I1 = Ri . Here we use that on S(0,4) = H2 ∼
= C4 the natural
44

complex structure operates as multiplication by i from the right. Therefore


ReA(1,3) (·, ·) = Re h(·, A(1,3) ·) = Re (h(·, −IE·)) = −g(·, IE·) = β4 ,

where β4 = β1 (IE·, ·) is the fourth element of our basis for super-admissible

bilinear forms on S(0,4) . In Section 3.4 we have shown that the Schur group
operates with a single open orbit, and we have shown that the Schur group
elements A = ± √12 (Id − IE) map β1 to β4 .

For time-like reductions, we define the chirality operator by
γ∗ = iΓ′1 = Γ1 = Γ2 · · · Γ5 = γ1 · · · γ4 .

Then the operator E acts indeed by multiplication with −γ∗ . We also define

γ0 := Γ′1 , so that γ∗ = iγ0 = −iγ 0 , as in [16].
4.2.3

Reduction (1, 4) → (1, 3)

We relate the γ-matrices by γ0 = Γ′1 and γ i = γi = Γi+1 for i = 1, 2, 3. The
A-matrix A(1,4) = Γ′1 = γ0 operates as K ⊗ I ⊗ 1 in the model given in
Section 3.2 for S(1,3) ∼
= R2 ⊗ R2 ⊗ R2 . Therefore

ReA(1,3) (·, ·) = Re h(·, Γ′1 ·) = g(·, K·) ⊗ g(·, I·) ⊗ g = −β0 ,

where β0 is the first element of our basis for the super-admissible bilinear
forms on S(1,3) . The element β0 belongs to the time-like open orbit under
the action of the Schur group by R>0 · SO0 (1, 3) transformations.
For space-like reductions we define the chirality operator as

γ∗ = Γ5 = Γ1 Γ2 Γ3 Γ4 = iΓ′1 Γ2 Γ3 Γ4 = iγ0 γ1 γ2 γ3 =: γ5 .
This definition of γ5 is consistent with [16].
4.2.4

Reduction (2, 3) → (1, 3)

We relate the γ-matrices by γ0 = Γ′2 , γi = Γi+2 , i = 1, 2, 3. In our representation Γ′1 = Γ′2 Γ3 Γ4 Γ5 = γ0 γ1 γ2 γ3 . In the model given in Section 3.2 for
45

S(1,3) we have γ∗ = iγ0 γ1 γ2 γ3 = γ5 , which acts through multiplication by

−K ⊗ J ⊗ K. The A-matrix is A(2,3) = Γ′1 Γ′2 = −iγ∗ γ0 . Now


ImA(2,3) (·, ·) = Im h(·, Γ′1 Γ′2 ·) = Im (h(·, −iγ∗ γ0 ·)) = −Re (h(·, γ∗ γ0 ·)) .

Since γ0 acts through multiplication by K ⊗ I ⊗ 1, the product γ∗ γ0 acts
through multiplication by −1 ⊗ K ⊗ K, so that

ImA(2,3) (·, ·) = g ⊗ g(·, K·) ⊗ g(·, K·) = β3 ,
where β3 is the fourth element of our basis for super-admissible bilinear
forms on S(1,3) . Since β3 belongs to the second, space-like open orbit of the
action of the Schur group by R>0 · SO0 (1, 3) transformations, the bilinear

forms β0 and β3 define non-isomorphic Poincaré Lie superalgebras. Thus the

two non-isomorphic N = 2 supersymmetry algebras in Minkowski signature
can both be realized through dimensional reduction, one coming from fivedimensional Minkowksi signature, the other from an exotic five-dimensional
signature with two time-like directions. The non-equivalence of the two
dimension reductions is as expected, because it was shown in [12] that the
five-dimensional R-symmetry group is SU(2) in signature (1, 4), but SU(1, 1)
in signature (2, 3). Note that this matches with the non-abelian parts of the
stabilizer groups computed in Section 3.2.
4.2.5

Reduction (2, 3) → (2, 2)

We relate the γ-matrices by Γ′1 = γ1 , Γ′2 = γ2 , Γ3 = γ3 , Γ4 = γ4 .
The volume element is −γ∗ := γ1 · · · γ4 = −Γ1 · Γ4 = −Γ5 . We compute


ImA(3,2 (·, ·) = Im h(·, Γ′1 Γ′2 ·) = −Re h(·, iΓ′1 Γ′2 ·) .

In the model given in Section 3.3 for S(2,2) ∼
= R2 ⊗ R2 ⊗ R2 , Γ′1 Γ′2 = γ1 γ2 acts

through multiplication by I ⊗ 1 ⊗ 1, while multiplication on i acts through
multiplication by

1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ I. Therefore

ImA(3,2) (·, ·) = −g(·, I·) ⊗ g ⊗ g(·, I·) = −g1 ⊗ g0 ⊗ g1 = −β4
46

where β4 is the fourth element of our basis for super-admissible bilinear
forms on S(2,2) . The chirality operator satisfies
γ∗ = Γ5 = Γ1 · · · Γ4 = −γ1 · · · γ4 .
4.2.6

Reduction (3, 2) → (2, 2)

We relate the γ-matrices by Γ′2 = γ1 , Γ′3 = γ2 , Γ4 = γ3 , Γ5 = γ4 . The
volume element is −γ∗ := γ1 · · · γ4 = Γ′2 Γ′3 Γ4 Γ5 = −iΓ′1 . The A-matrix is

A(3,2) = Γ′1 Γ′2 Γ′3 = −iγ∗ γ1 γ2 . Therefore


ImA(3,2) (·, ·) = Im h(·, Γ′1 Γ′2 Γ′3 ·) = Im (h(·, −iγ∗ γ1 γ2 ·)) = Re (h(·, −γ∗ γ1 γ2 ·)) .

In the model given in Section 3.3 for S(2,2) , −γ∗ acts through multiplication
by −I ⊗ I ⊗ 1 and γ1 γ2 through multiplication by −I ⊗ 1. Therefore
ImA(3,2) (·, ·) = −g ⊗ g(·, I·) ⊗ g = g ⊗ g(I·, ·) ⊗ g = β1 ,

where β1 is the first element in our basis for super-admissible bilinear forms
on S(2,2) . We have shown in Section 3.3 that β1 and β4 belong to the
same orbit, namely the time-like open orbit of the action of the connected
Schur group by CO0 (2, 2) = R>0 · SO0 (2, 2) transformations. Therefore the

Poincaré Lie superalgebras defined by β1 and β4 are isomorphic. We have
also shown that the full Schur group acts with a single open orbit, so that

there is only one N = 2 supersymmetry algebra in signature (2, 2), up to
isomorphism.

Doubled Spinors
General considerations

Later in this paper we will obtain four-dimensional off-shell vector multiplets
for all possible signatures by dimensional reduction of their five-dimensional
counterparts, which have been constructed in [12]. Like [12] we will use
doubled spinors, which are a generalisation of symplectic Majorana spinors,
47

to describe the fermionic sector. The idea is to start with two copies S ⊕ S of

the complex spinor module, and then to recover S by imposing a Spin0 (t, s)invariant reality condition. This is always possible since S⊕S ∼
= S⊗C C2 , and
since S either carries an invariant quaternionic structure (this is the familiar
case of symplectic Majorana spinors), or an invariant real structure. On C2
we define a complex anti-linear map by

Given any admissible real bilinear form β on S we can obtain a superadmissible complex bilinear form b = β ⊗ M on S ⊗ C2 , by choosing M to

be symmetric if σ(β)τ (β) = 1 and antisymmetric if σ(β)τ (β) = −1.

6
We use a notation which is adapted to the NW-SE convention for raising and lowering
the indices i, j = 1, 2. The fact that i, j, . . . occur in anti-lexicographic ordering in several
formulae is a consequence of our NW-SE style notation and does not indicate matrix
transposition.

48

As bilinear form on C2 we always choose either the standard symmetric
complex bilinear form gC2 or the standard antisymmetric complex bilinear
form εC2 on C2 . Using the matrices

representing these bilinear forms, we have M (·, ·) = gC2 (·, M ·), where M = δ

or M = ε.

To have an admissible complex bilinear form on S to start with, we
use the one defined by the charge conjugation matrix C, so that b ∝ C ⊗

M , where we allow a normalization factor for which a convenient value
will be chosen later. In even dimensions there are two inequivalent charge
conjugation matrices C± , so that we can define two super-admissible bilinear
forms b± ∝ C± ⊗ M± , where M± is chosen such that the vector-valued

bilinear form b± (γ µ ·, ·) is symmetric. By restricting b± to the real points

with respect to the invariant real structure ρ, we obtain super-admissible
real bilinear forms b±|ρ on (S + S)ρ ∼
= S.
We remark that the doubled spinor module S ⊕ S can be viewed as the

complexification of the complex spinor module S, as follows. Firstly, S and
S ⊕ S carry by construction a representation of the complex Clifford algebra

Clt+s and of the complex spin group Spin(t + s, C), and the complex bilinear
form b ∝ C ⊗ M is Spin(t + s, C) invariant. Since S carries an invariant ǫ(ǫ)(α)

complex structure JS
, it is self-conjugate as a complex Spin(t, s) module,
∼ S̄. Therefore S⊕S is the complexification of S, regarded as a real module:
S=
SC := S ⊗R C ∼
= S + S̄ ∼
=S+S∼
= S ⊗C C2 .

The doubled spinor module, equipped with a super-admissible complex bilinear form, defines a complex Poincaré Lie superalgebra gC = so(VC )+VC +SC ,
where VC = V ⊗ C. If we extend ρ in the obvious way to gC , the restriction
of gC to the real points of ρ picks a real form gρ ∼
= so(V ) + V + S ⊂ gC .
49

In [12] this observation was used to construct the vector multiplet theories
with t + s = 5 as real forms of an underlying ‘holomorphic master theory.’
So far our discussion of doubled spinors has applied to all dimensions
and signatures. We now specialise to the dimensions t + s = 5, 4 which
we consider in this paper. In five dimensions the space of super-admissible
bilinear forms is one-dimensional [10], see [12] for a detailed account of the
material reviewed in the following. The unique charge conjugation matrix C
satisfies στ = −1, see Table 21, so that C ⊗ ε, where ε = εC2 is the standard
anti-symmetric complex bilinear form on C2 , is a super-admissible form on

S ⊗ C2 .

The various signatures (t, s), t + s = 5 can be grouped into two classes,

see also Table 17
1. t = 0, 1, 4, 5. For these signature the super-admissible real bilinear
form on S is ReA(t,s) , where A(t,s) (ψ, φ) = h(t,s) (ψ, φ) = ψ † A(t,s) φ is
the standard Spin0 -invariant sesquilinear form. The complex spinor
module S carries a quaternionic structure, and the Schur group H∗ =
R>0 × SU(2) acts as R>0 , that is by rescaling on the one-dimensional

space of superbrackets. The R-symmetry group is SU(2).

2. t = 2, 3. The super-admissible real bilinear form on S is ImA(t,s) , the
complex spinor module carries a real structure, and the Schur group
R>0 · SU(1, 1) acts again by rescalings, so that the R-symmetry group
is SU(1, 1).

(α)(ǫ)

The real structures used in [12] are ρ = JS

(ǫ)

⊗ JC2 with ǫ = −1 for

t = 0, 1, 4, 5 and with ǫ = 1 for t = 2, 3. By adopting the normalisation

b := − 12 C ⊗ ε and making a suitable choices for the phases α (see the
first column of Table 18), we can arrange that the restriction b|ρ of b to
(S ⊕ S)ρ ∼
= S is
(
Re(A) for t = 0, 1, 4, 5 ,
b|ρ =
Im(A) for t = 2, 3 .
50

In four dimensions we have two inequivalent charge conjugation matrices:
C− , which is equal to the five-dimensional charge conjugation matrix, C− =
C, and C+ = γ∗ C− . Their invariants σ (symmetry), τ (type) and ι (isotropy)
can be found in Table 21 in Appendix A.1. We choose a representation where
γ∗ is real and symmetric, and commutes with C± , which is possible in four
dimensions, see Appendix A.1 .
Note that both bilinear forms C± are orthogonal ι = 1, that is C± (S± , S∓ ) =
0. Since γ∗ anticommutes with all γ-matrices this implies that the vector-

valued bilinear forms C∓ (γ µ ·, ·) are isotropic, C± (γ µ S± , S± ) = 0. Since

σ(C− )τ (C− ) = −1 and σ(C+ )τ (C+ ) = 1, we can construct two super-

admissible isotropic vector-valued complex bilinear form on S ⊗ C2 : (C− ⊗
ε)(γ m ·, ·), which is the reduction of the five-dimensional complex bilinear

form, and (C+ ⊗ δ)(γ m ·, ·), which does not have a five-dimensional uplift.

Using the formulae collected in Appendix A.2 we can dimensionally re-

duce the five-dimensional reality conditions chosen in [12] to obtain the
corresponding reality conditions in four-dimensions. The resulting reality
conditions are listed in Table 18.
4.3.2

Doubled spinor formulation for signature (0, 4)

We have shown in Section 3.4 that in Euclidean signature all N = 2 Poincaré

Lie superalgebras are isomorphic to each other. Starting in five dimensions, we can obtain two theories through the reductions (0, 5) → (0, 4) and
(1, 4) → (0, 4), which we will want to relate explicitly by a field redefinition

later. Therefore we now investigate how superbrackets formulated using
doubled spinors are related to one another in signature (0, 4).
In four dimensions, we can independently choose either C+ or C− to

define a complex bilinear form and either B+ or B− to impose a reality
condition. Both B+ and B− define quaternionic structures on S so that we
have two types of symplectic Majorana spinors. There are four combinations

Here (0, 5✁) is a shorthand notation for the reduction (0, 5) → (0, 4). The

bilinear forms based on C+ cannot be obtained directly from dimensional

reduction. In this section we will show that one can independently map the
two complex bilinear forms and the two reality conditions to one another,
and thus obtain explicit maps between all four real superbrackets within the
doubled spinor formalism.
Mapping reality conditions, preserving the bilinear form
Let λi be a doubled spinor subject to a reality condition of the form
(λi )∗ = αB− λj Mji ,

where M is a two-by-two matrix.
We would like to find a linear transformation (λi ) 7→ (Ψi ), such that Ψi

satisfy the reality condition

(Ψi )∗ = βB+ Ψj Mji .

In signature (0, 4) we have γ∗ B− = B− γ∗ = B+ .
We make the following ansatz:
1
λi = √ (a1 + bγ∗ )Ψi .
2
The operator a1 + bγ∗ is invertible for a 6= ±b, and Ψi is given by
1
Ψi = √ (a∗ 1 + b∗ γ∗ )λi ,

where a, b ∈ C satisfy |a|2 + |b|2 = 2 and ab∗ + ba∗ = 0.

α.

In table 18 the phase

factors of the reality conditions in signature (0, 4) are related by β = −iα

so that the reality conditions can be mapped by setting a = 1, b = −i:
1

λi = √ (1 − iγ∗ ) Ψi ⇔ Ψi = √ (1 + iγ∗ ) λi .

(4.5)

Since a1 + bγ∗ commutes with γ∗ , the chirality of spinors is preserved under

the transformation. To see how expressing λi in terms of Ψi acts on the
complex bilinear forms, compute
(γ m λi )T C± χj Mji

Here we used that γ∗ is symmetric and γ∗ C± = C± γ∗ , as well as γ∗ γ m =

−γ m γ∗ . Thus the four super-admissible bilinear forms are invariant up to

a factor, and strictly invariant for the choice a = 1, b = −i. Thus we can

map the two reality conditions to each other while preserving any of the two
super-admissible complex bilinear forms.
Mapping bilinear forms, preserving reality conditions

Next we look for a map relating the two complex bilinear forms C− ⊗ ǫ and

C+ ⊗ δ to one another. For this it is helpful to use the natural embedding

S± ⊂ S to define ‘twice-doubled spinors’:

λI = [λi+ , λi− ] = [λ1+ , λ2+ , λ1− , λ2− ] ∈ S+ ⊕S+ ⊕S− ⊕S− ⊂ S⊕S⊕S⊕S ∼
= S⊗C4 ,
where I = 1, 2, 3, 4 is an index for the extended internal space C4 . We can
now use a concise block-matrix type notation for the bilinear form C− ⊗ ε:
(C− ⊗ ε)(γ m λ, χ) = (γ m λi+ )T C− χj− εji + (γ m λi− )T C− χj+ εji

In terms of components, this is
λi+ = Ψi+
λi− = −εij Ψj− = Ψj− εji ⇔ Ψi− = −λj− εji .

(4.7)

Note that when using twice doubled spinors, we only need to consider linear transformations which act on the extended internal index I, but not
on spinor indices. This disentangling of spinor and internal indices with
respect to the action of the Schur group is an important advantage of the
‘twice-doubled’ notation. It reflects that while the Schur group only acts
55

on internal space of the doubled spinor formalism in odd dimensions, it can
act differently on the chiral components of a spinor in even dimension. This
is taken care of in the twice-doubled notation by doubling the auxiliary
internal space.
The map defined by (4.6), (4.7) works for any signature, but whether it
preserves reality conditions depends on the signature. In signature (0, 4) γ∗
commutes with B± , and therefore reality conditions can be imposed consis-

tently on the symplectic Majorana-Weyl spinors λI± . We should therefore

expect that any of the two reality conditions is preserved. To verify this note

first that S is block-diagonal and manifestly preserves chirality. It is also
manifest that λi+ and Ψi+ satisfy the same reality condition. Now assume
that (λi− )∗ = αB∓ λj− εji . Then
(Ψi− )∗ = −(λj− )∗ εji = −αB∓ λki εkj εji = αB∓ λi− = αB∓ Ψj− εji ,
and we see that the reality condition is preserved. Thus the map defined
by S interchanges the complex vector-valued bilinear forms while preserving
any of the two reality conditions in signature (0, 4).
The following diagram summarizes the situation. We can independently
change the reality condition by (4.5) and the complex bilinear form (4.7).
These two operations are indicated by ‘RC’ and ‘Bil’ respectively.

Doubled spinor formulation for signature (1, 3)

The Lorentzian case differs in several ways from the Euclidean case. We
have shown in Section 3.2 that there are two non-isomorphic supersymmetry
algebras distinguishable by their R-symmetry groups, which are U(2) and
U(1, 1) respectively. Moreover, from Section 4.2 we know that the first case
56

can be realized through reduction from (1, 4), while the second arises by
reduction from (2, 3).
On the complex spinor module S the B-matrix B− induced by dimensional reduction defines a quaternionic structure, while B+ defines a real
structure. Therefore theories can be formulated using either symplectic Majorana spinors or Majorana spinors. Within the doubled spinor formalism it
is natural to consider six real supersymmetry algebras, which are obtained
by combining the two complex bilinear forms C− ⊗ ǫ and C+ ⊗ δ with the

following three reality conditions:

(λi )∗ = αB− λj ǫji ,

(4.8)

(Ψi )∗ = βB+ Ψi = βB+ Ψj δji ,

(4.9)

(ϕi )∗ = γB+ ϕj ηji .

(4.10)

The first and second condition are the standard symplectic Majorana and
standard Majorana condition, respectively. The third condition is a Majorana condition which couples a pair of spinors through the matrix

which differs from the standard Majorana condition by a relative sign. Such
reality conditions have appeared in [6], where they were used to define the
‘twisted’ supersymmetry algebras of type-II∗ string theories. In the terminology of [6] the reality conditions (4.9) and (4.10), (4.11) are referred to
as O(2) Majorana and O(1, 1) Majorana, respectively. In our approach it is
crucial that the matrices entering into the definition of the (complexified)
superbracket and into the reality condition are chosen independently. Since
57

the R-symmetry group is an invariance group of the super-bracket rather
than the reality condition, we will call (4.9) the standard or diagonal Majorana condition and (4.10) the twisted Majorana condition. The twisted
Majorana condition was used in [12] to formulate five-dimensional vector
multiplets in signatures (2, 3) and (3, 2).
From Section 4.1 we know that in signature (1, 3) reality conditions are
not compatible with chirality, since complex conjugation flips the chirality
of a spinor. Therefore chiral projections of reality conditions take the form
(λi± )∗ = αB− λj∓ Mji , (λi± )∗ = αB+ λj∓ Mji ,
′ , ε }. In order to relate reality conditions to one
with Mji ∈ {δji , ηji , ηji
ji

another it is useful to note that B± γ∗ = B∓ implies

B+ λi+ = B− λi+ , B+ λi− = −B− λi− .

(4.12)

The standard N = 2 superalgebra, GR ∼
= U(2)
By dimensional reduction from five dimensions, we obtain a representation
of the standard N = 2 algebra in terms of symplectic Majorana spinors. By

comparison to Table 18 we see that the reduction (1, 4) → (1, 3) corresponds
to the following combination of a bilinear form with a reality condition:


i ∗
j
C− ⊗ ε, (λ ) = αB− λ ǫji , with α = −1 .

In signature (1, 3) Majorana spinors are more commonly used. To rewrite
symplectic Majorana spinors in terms of Majorana spinors we adapt the
map given in the appendix of [16]:7

Note that there is a typographic mistake in formula (A.13) of [16].

58

(4.13)

where we used that (−1)t γ∗ B± = B± γ∗ = B∓ . It is straightforward to

check that (Ψi )∗ = βB+ Ψi , so that this formula exchanges the two reality

conditions, and simultaneously exchanges the vector-valued bilinear forms,
up to a phase factor:
[C− ⊗ ε](γ µ λ, χ) =
Of course

β

α

(4.14)

must be real, since the restrictions of both vector-valued bilinear

forms to their respective real points are assumed to be real-valued. By
choosing α = β we can adjust the phase factor to unity.
Alternatively, we can work with twice-doubled spinors and use the map
Bil defined by (4.6) which exchanges the bilinear forms C− ⊗ ε and C+ ⊗ δ.

In signature (1, 3) this map acts non-trivially on the reality conditions, since
complex conjugation anti-commutes with chiral projection.
If λi are symplectic Majorana spinors, then their chiral projections satisfy
(λi± )∗ = αB− λj∓ εji .
Using the component form (4.7) of the map Bil we compute
(Ψi+ )∗ = (λi+ )∗ = αB− λj− εji = −αB− Ψj− = αB+ Ψi− ,

(Ψi− )∗ = −(λj− )∗ εji = −αB− λk εkj εji = αB− λi+ = αB− Ψi+ = αB+ Ψi+ .

Thus the map Bil exchanges symplectic Majorana and Majorana spinors in
signature (1, 3).
Since we will show in the next section that the other four combinations of
complex bilinear forms with reality conditions correspond to the second, nonequivalent N = 2 superalgebra, we can summarize this section as follows:
(
C− ⊗ ε,
(λi )∗ = αB− λj εji ← (1, 4✁) ,
(4.15)
GR = U(2)
C+ ⊗ δ,
(Ψi )∗ = βB+ Ψi .
Here (1, 4✁) is a short-hand notation to indicate the reduction (1, 4) → (1, 3).

The second line is the most commonly used formulation of the standard N =
59

2 supersymmetry algebra in terms of Majorana spinors. For comparison, we
will give a formulation of the twisted N = 2 supersymmetry algebra in terms
in Majorana spinors in (4.18).

The twisted N = 2 supersymmetry algebra, GR ∼
= U(1, 1)
We now turn to the second family of N = 2 algebras, which have R-

symmetry group U(1, 1). This algebra can be realized by reduction from
five dimensions with signature (2, 3), which can be related to the three remaining combinations of complex bilinear forms and reality conditions:

where α, β, γ, δ are phase factors. Transformations which relate these four
combinations can easily be found using the twice doubled formalism. Since
the computations are similar to previous computations, we only give a summary and add some explanatory comments. Further details have been relegated to Appendix B.1. The map defined by the matrix S in (4.6) exchanges
the two bilinear forms. While it preserves reality conditions in Euclidean
signature, it changes them in Minkowski signature. Specifically, if we use S
to relate ΨI to ΩI , then S maps the standard Majorana condition to the
symplectic Majorana condition. And if we apply S to λI , it maps the symplectic Majorana condition to the twisted Majorana condition, but with the

form (ηij

complex bilinear form C+ ⊗ δ, together with a reality condition of the form

(ϕi )∗ = αB+ ϕj ηji

obtain the pair

(C+ ⊗ η ′ , (ϕi )∗ = γB+ ϕi ) ,

(4.18)

where the Majorana condition is standard, while the complex bilinear form
is C+ ⊗ η ′ . This is the form in which twisted supersymmetry algebras in ten

dimensions were defined in [5].
4.3.4

Doubled spinor formulation for signature (2, 2)

The situation in signature (2, 2) is again different. We have shown in Section 3.3 that as in Euclidean signature the Schur group acts with a single
open orbit, corresponding to a unique N = 2 superalgebra with connected
R-symmetry group GR ∼
= R>0 × SO0 (1, 2). From Section 4.2 we know that
62

the algebra corresponding to the time-like open orbit of the Schur group can
be obtained by dimensional reduction from either signature (2, 3) or (3, 2),
while the isomorphic algebras corresponding to the space-like orbit cannot
be obtained directly by dimensional reduction. In signature (2, 2) both B−
and B+ define a real structure, implying that we there are different types
of Majorana spinors, but no symplectic Majorana spinors. As discussed
in Section 4.3.3 we can impose either the standard or the twisted Majorana condition on pairs of spinors. Together with the choice of a complex
superbracket on the doubled spinor module, we have eight different real superbrackets, corresponding to the following combinations between complex
superbrackets and reality conditions:

The two theories obtained by dimensional reduction have the vector-valued
bilinear form C− ⊗ ε and the off-diagonal Majorana condition with either

B− or B+ , see table 18.

It is straightforward to find linear transformations which relate the eight
real superbrackets to one another. Since the required computations are
very similar to computations we have done before, we only give a brief
summary and provide some comments, while the details have been relegated
to Appendix B.2. Firstly, the map defined by (4.6) can be used to map the
two complex bilinear forms to one another. For standard Majorana spinors
this preserves the reality condition, while for twisted Majorana spinors it
exchanges B± with B∓ . Secondly, the maps defined by the operators
63

√1 (1±
2

iγ∗ ) exchange B+ and B− in any of the reality conditions while preserving
the matrix Nij = δij , ηij . Thirdly, one can map standard Majorana spinors
with respect to B± to twisted Majorana spinors with respect to B∓ . This
reflects that B± differ by a relative sign between the semi-spinor modules,
which is equivalent to changing the signature of the bilinear form on the
auxiliary space of the twice-doubled spinor module. Combining these three
maps any of the eight superbrackets can be related to any other.

Four-dimensional N = 2 supersymmetric vector
multiplets and their Lagrangians

5
5.1

General considerations

We will now present the four-dimensional off-shell supersymmetry transformations and Lagrangians which are obtained by dimensional reduction of
the five-dimensional supersymmetry transformations and Lagrangians constructed in [12]. Since the actual computational steps are essentially the
same as in [16], where the reductions (1, 4) → (1, 3) and (1, 4) → (0, 4) were

carried out, we will only state the final results. All details required to repli-

cate these results can be found in [16], [12] and in the preceding sections and
appendices of this paper. Compared to [16], one has to manage various factors of −1 and i, which is taken care of by our conventions for dimensionally
reducing Clifford algebras and reality conditions.

To make the paper self-contained, we still need to review the relevant
properties of five- and four-dimensional vector multiplets. The field content
of a theory of nV five-dimensional off-shell vector multiplets is
(σ I , λiI , AIµ , YijI ) ,
where I = 1, . . . , nV , i = 1, 2. The fields σ I are real scalar fields. All couplings in the five-dimensional Lagrangian are encoded in a real function, the
Hesse potential F(σ I ) (sometimes also called the prepotential). The scalar
64

2 F
and vector coupling matrices are proportional to the Hessian FIJ = ∂IJ

of the function F. The theory also contains a Chern-Simons term, with

couplings proportional to the third derivatives FIJK of F. Since gauge in-

variance (up to boundary terms) requires FIJK to be constant, the function

F must be a cubic polynomial in σ I .8 The resulting geometry is called affine

special real geometry, see the end of Section 4 of [16] for the precise definition.
Roughly speaking, an affine special real manifold is a pseudo-Riemannian
manifold whose metric, when written in terms of certain coordinates, which
are unique up to affine transformations, is the Hessian of a cubic real polynomial. The fields λiI , i = 1, 2, are pairs of spinors, subject to either a
symplectic Majorana condition or a twisted Majorana condition:
(
αt,s Bλj εji , t = 0, 1, 4, 5 ,
(λi )∗ =
.
αt,s Bλj ηji , t = 2, 3 .
The unit norm complex coefficients αt,s are chosen according to Table 3 in
[12], and have been listed in Table 18. With this convention the brackets on
S and S⊗C2 have both standard form. The fields AIµ , µ = 1, . . . , 5 are vector
fields, and Yij are auxiliary fields, which form a symmetric tensor under the
action of the R-symmetry group, which is SU(2) for t = 0, 1, 4, 5 and SU(1, 1)
for t = 2, 3. The auxiliary fields are subject to the following R-symmetry
invariant reality condition, which is induced by the reality condition imposed
on the spinors:
(Y ij )∗ =

(

Y kl εki εlj , t = 0, 1, 4, 5 ,
Y kl ηki ηlj , t = 2, 3 .

All together, a vector multiplet has 8 + 8 off-shell degrees of freedom, which
reduce to 4 + 4 on-shell degrees of freedom upon imposing the equations of
motion. We refer to [12] for further details.
Starting from the six possible signatures (t, s), t + s = 5 in five dimensions, there are ten different reductions to the five signatures (t′ , s′ ),
8

To have standard kinetic terms in signature (1, 4) one must impose in addition that
FIJ is positive definite.

65

t′ + s′ = 4 in four dimensions. The procedure of reduction is standard and
straightforward. We use the notation and conventions of [16], which allow
us to present the final expressions in a concise form. When reducing over
the direction labeled by the index ∗, the five-dimensional vector fields AIµ

decompose into four-dimensional vector fields AIm and scalars bI = AI∗ . In
the reduction (1, 4) → (1, 3) the five-dimensional scalars σ I combine with

the scalars bI = AI∗ into complex scalars X I = σ I + ibI . The scalar manifold

is an affine special Kähler manifold, as required by global N = 2 super-

symmetry. For time-like reductions (1, 4) → (0, 4), the kinetic terms of
the scalars σ I and bI come with a relative sign and cannot be combined

into a complex scalar. As shown in [16] the scalar geometry of Euclidean
four-dimensional rigid vector multiplets is affine special para-Kähler, that
is the complex structure is replaced by a para-complex structure. One can
introduce para-complex scalar fields X I = σ I + ebI , where the para-complex
unit e satisfies ē = −e and e2 = 1. More generally, the special geometry of
rigid and local vector and hypermultiplets in Euclidean signature involves

the para-complex analogues of the familiar special Kähler, hyper-Kähler and
quaternionic Kähler geometries. We refer to [16, 17, 18, 19] for details.
When carrying out the ten possible reductions from five to four dimensions we find that the target space geometry only depends on the fourdimensional signature, and not on the five-dimensional parent theory. In
Lorentz signature the target space is affine special Kähler, in Euclidean and
neutral signature it is affine special para-Kähler. The relative signs between
the kinetic terms of σ I and bI are listed in Table 20, while the types of target
space geometries are listed in Table 19. These results are consistent with
[15].
Before displaying the supersymmetry transformations and Lagrangians,
we explain the ε-complex notation introduced in [16, 18]. Depending on
context a ‘bar’ over a scalar X denotes complex or para-complex conjugation:
X I = σ I + ibI ⇒ X̄ I = σ I − ibI , X I = σ I + ebI ⇒ X̄ I = σ I − ebI .
66

When referring to both the complex and para-complex case simultaneously,
we use the term ε-complex, where ε = −1 means complex, and ε = 1 means

para-complex, and we define iε = i, e, respectively. The field content of a
four-dimensional vector multiplet is
(X I , λiI , AIm , YijI ) ,
where X I are ε-complex scalars, λiI are pairs of spinors subject to a reality condition, AIm , m = 1, 2, 3, 4 are vector fields, and YijI are auxiliary
symmetric tensor fields, subject to the reality condition induced by the one
imposed on the spinors. Since we construct the four-dimensional theories
by the reduction of five-dimensional theories, the reality conditions of λiI
and YijI are inherited from the five-dimensional theory, see Table 18. Note
however that because the space of superbrackets is four-dimensional in four
dimensions, we can change the superbracket by field redefinitions after the
dimensional reduction. In the doubled formalism this changes the reality
conditions imposed on λiI and Yij .
In four dimensions the supersymmetry transformations and the Lagrangian can be organised into ε-holomorphic and ε-anti-holomorphic terms,
which are paired with chiral projections of the spinors. To write expressions
uniformly, it is necessary to modify the chiral projection in the para-complex
case such that it includes a factor e. In order to see explicitly why this is
necessary, recall that since γ∗ B± = (−1)t B± γ∗ in four dimensions, complex
conjugation acting on spinors preserves chirality in the signatures t = 0, 2, 4
with para-complex scalar geometry, but exchanges chiralities in the signatures t = 1, 3 with complex scalar geometry,
(
Bλj± Mji , t = 0, 2, 4 ,
(λi± )∗ = α
Bλj∓ Mji , t = 1, 3 ,
where λi± = 12 (1 ± γ∗ )λi . Following [16] we therefore define modified chiral

67

projectors:
1
Π± = (1 ± Γ∗ ) , Γ∗ =
2
and correspondingly λi± :=

(

eγ∗ , t = 0, 2, 4 ,
γ∗ ,

t = 1, 3 ,

1 ± Γ∗ )λi . Since e2 = 1, the operators Π±

are still projection operators. If we define the conjugation (λiI
± ) of the

chiral projection of a spinor to include para-complex conjugation, chirality
is flipped under ∗ in all signatures:
jI
∗
(λiI
± ) = αBλ∓ Mji .

Note that
γ∗ λi± = ±eλi± ⇔ Γ∗ λi± = ±λi± .

satisfy:

where ∗ is ε-complex conjugation on the tangent space of the scalar manifold.

Formulas in Euclidean and neutral signature include both factors of i and

of e. To avoid confusion, we point out that i corresponds to the action of the
complex number on the spinor module, while e corresponds to the action of
the para-complex numbers on the para-complexified tangent bundle of the
scalar manifold. We refer to [16] for details.
In special ε-Kähler geometry, all couplings are encoded in a single function F(X I ), which is ε-holomorphic in the ε-complex scalars X I . When
68

obtaining a four-dimensional vector multiplet theory by dimensional reduction, the prepotential is given by the extension of the cubi Hesse potential
F(σ I ) from real to ε-complex values, F(X I ) = F(σ I + iε bI ). Without

a proportionality factor between Hesse potential and prepotential we obtain a parametrization known as ‘old conventions’ in the literature. The
parametrization according to the ‘new conventions’ is obtained by setting
F (new) =

1
(old) .
2iǫ F

We will use the old conventions to display our results.

As the Hesse potential is a cubic polynomial, so is any prepotential

obtained by dimensional reduction. However, in four dimensions any εholomorphic prepotential defines a valid vector multiplet theory as long as
the scalar and vector coupling matrices NIJ , which in the old conventions
are given by NIJ = Re(FIJ ) are non-degenerate.9 Since the only term involving the fourth derivative FIJKL is a four-fermion term, one can take

the supersymmetry variations and Lagrangians obtained by dimensional reduction, allow F to be a general ε-holomorphic function, and obtain the
four-fermion term by checking which terms proportional to FIJKL are gen-

erated by supersymmetry, see [16] for details. We will not work out the
four-fermion terms in this paper, but write the Lagrangian in a form which
remains valid if the prepotential is a general ǫ-holomorphic function. In

particular, while FIJK is a real constant when obtained from dimensional
reduction, we will distinguish between FIJK and F̄IJK when organising

terms into ε-holomorphic and ε-anti-holomorphic components.

In the following sections we present the supersymmetry transformations and Lagrangians for the ten different reductions from five- to fourdimensional vector multiplet theories. Using the ε-complex notation, the
ten different reductions can be combined into only four ‘types’ of supersymmetry transformations and Lagrangians. Table 19 lists for each reduction
to which type it corresponds, and for convenience also the scalar geometry,

In new conventions the scalar and vector coupling matrices are given by NIJ =

in signature (1, 3) one must then impose that ImFIJ
is negative definite.

The supersymmetry variation parameters are doubled spinors denoted ǫ =
(ǫi ) and are subject to the same reality conditions as the doubled spinors λ =
70

(λi ), which are listed in table 18. For all theories obtained by dimensional
reduction the underlying complex superbracket is defined by the complex
bilinear form C− ⊗ ε, and therefore indices i, j = 1, 2 are raised and lowered

using εij and εij , irrespective of the reality condition, in the same way as in
[12], namely
λi = εij λj , λi = λj εji , εik εkj = −δji ,

which conforms with the NW-SE convention. We use the notation ✓
∂ =
γ m ∂m .
With regard to the splitting into ε-holomorphic and ε-anti-holomorphic
parts it is important to keep in mind the following notational conventions:
the operation ¯· denotes ε-complex conjugation for scalars X I , but, as be-

fore, Majorana conjugation based on the charge conjugation matrix C− for

spinors λI . The chiral projectors for spinors include a factor e for those
signatures where the target geometry is para-complex. The real structure
relating ε-holomorphic and ε-anti-holomorphic expressions is the combined
complex/para-complex conjugation ∗, which acts on both the target space
and the spinor module. Spinors are Grassmann-valued, and we use a convention where complex conjugation does not reverse the order of factors
in monomials.10 The self-dual and anti-self-dual projections of tensors are
defined using projections which include a factor e for signatures where the
target space geometry is para-complex. Note that (5.2) agrees with (5.64)
of [16], which is the original reference for the reductions (1, 4) 7→ (0, 4) and

(1, 4) 7→ (1, 3).
Lagrangians

The following Lagrangians, obtained by dimensional reduction, are by construction invariant under the supersymmetry transformations given in the
previous section. With regard to the overall sign of the Lagrangian, we have
10

If one converts our expressions to the convention where complex conjugation reverses
the order of Grassmann variables, this leads to additional factors of (powers of) i.

71

adopted the convention that the sign of the coefficient of the Maxwell term
is always negative. This is motivated by the fact that in Lorentz signature
this choice of sign corresponds to positive kinetic energy of the Maxwell
field, irrespective of whether we choose the mostly plus or the mostly minus
convention.

Note that this Lagrangian agrees with (5.70) of [16].11 Also note that the
fermions are symplectic Majorana spinors, while in signature (1, 3) one would
normally write the theory in terms of Majorana spinors. This can be done
using the isomorphism found in Section 4.3.3. In fact it was checked in [16],
that upon rewriting the theory in terms of Majorana spinors one obtains
supersymmetry transformations and Lagrangians which are consistent with
the literature.

(In-)Equivalent theories and the relative signs of scalar
and vector kinetic terms

We now continue our discussion of the properties of the ten vector multiplet
representations and Lagrangians that we have obtained in the five distinct
signatures. From the classification of four-dimensional N = 2 Poincaré

Lie superalgebras, combined with our knowledge of R-symmetry groups, we
already know in which cases the two theories in any given signature must
be equivalent.
The structure of all ten vector multiplet theories is the same, the only
difference being relative signs between bosonic terms and relative factors of
i between fermionic terms. We focus on the bosonic terms in the following.
The relative signs between the kinetic terms of the scalars σ I = ReX I
and bI = ImX I have already been discussed. They are related to whether
the target geometry is complex or para-complex, which in turn depends on
the signature, or more precisely on the Abelian factor of the R-symmetry
group [16], which is U(1) for complex and SO(1, 1) for para-complex target
geometry. We now turn to the relative sign between the scalar and the
I F J|mn . All relevant signs have
vector term (Maxwell term) F 2 ∝ NIJ Fmn

been listed in Table 20. As already mentioned our convention for the overall
75

sign is that the vector term always comes with a negative sign. The signature
of NIJ depends on the choice of the prepotential and the range of the scalar
fields. We focus on the model-independent overall sign between scalar and
vector terms.

Table 20: Relative signs between vector kinetic terms and scalar kinetic
terms for the ten possible dimensional reductions.

5.6.1

Euclidean signature

The Euclidean signatures (0, 4) and (4, 0) are equivalent. We discuss the
case (0, 4) for definiteness. The target space geometry is para-Kähler, and
the relative sign between scalar and vector terms is different for the reductions (0, 5) → (0, 4) and (1, 4) → (0, 4). Since we have shown in Section

3.4 that the Euclidean N = 2 supersymmetry algebra is unique up to iso-

morphism, we expected that the two sets of supersymmetry transformations
and Lagrangians are related by a field redefinition, which we will now identify explicitly. The relation between the two supersymmetry algebras in the
doubled spinor formulation was found in Section 4.3.2, see formula (4.4).
In the following we denote the spinors resulting from the Type 2 reduction
76

(0, 5) → (0, 4) by λi and the spinors resulting from the Type 1 reduction

(1, 4) → (0, 4) by λ̃i . Then (4.5) becomes

1
1
λi = √ (1 − iγ∗ ) λ̃i = √ (1 − ieΓ∗ ) λ̃i ,
(5.10)
2
2
where we expressed the standard chirality matrix γ∗ in terms of the matrix

Γ∗ = eγ∗ , which we use in the para-holomorphic formalism. The inverse
transformation is
1
1
λ̃i = √ (1 + iγ∗ ) λi = √ (1 + ieΓ∗ ) λi .
2
2
The chiral projections are related by:
1
λi± = √ (1 ± ie)λ̃i± .
2
Note that the positive and negative chirality terms transform with a relative
sign. We will also need the relations between the following spinor bilinears:
¯ ∗ λ̃ = −ieǫ̃Γ
¯ ∗ λ̃ ⇒ ǭ± λ± = ∓ieǫ̃¯± λ̃± ,
ǭλ = −iǫ̃γ
¯ m λ̃ ⇒ ǭ± λ∓ = ǫ̃¯± λ̃∓ ,
ǭγ m λ = ǫ̃γ

¯ mn γ∗ λ̃ = −ieǫ̃γ
¯ mn Γ∗ λ̃ ⇒ ǭ± γ mn λ± = ∓ieǫ̃¯± γ mn λ̃± .
ǭγ mn λ = −iǫ̃γ
Note that the vector bilinear remains the same, as it must since the vector bilinear defines the complex supersymmetry algebra, which remains unchanged. The scalar and tensor bilinear transform non-trivially, and with a
relative sign between terms of positive and negative chirality.
Substituting (5.10) into the supersymmetry transformations (5.4), and
using the above relations, we obtain

where changes of relative factors have been indicated in boldface. Comparing
to the supersymmetry variations (5.2) for the reduction (1, 4) → (0, 4) we
see that they agree up to factors of e which can be aborbed by setting

X̃ I = −eX I . Thus we have identified a field redefinition which maps the

two vector multiplets to each other. Turning our attention to the Lagrangian
we find that applying (5.10) to (5.5) gives

This has to match with (5.3) upon setting X̃ I = −eX I . To see that this
is indeed the case, we need to work out the effect of this transformation on

the prepotential and its derivatives. The prepotential is a para-holomorphic
function and transforms as a scalar:
F̃ (X̃) = F(X) .
For the para-holomorphic transformation X̃ I = −eX I the Jacobian is
∂ X̃ I
= −eδJI ,
∂X J
and therefore derivatives transform according to
F̃I = −eFI , F̃IJ = FIJ , F̃IJK = −eFIJK ,
¯ = eF̄ , F̃
¯ = F̄ ,
F̃
I
I

¯

IJK = eF̄IJK .

This precisely produces all the factors e that are needed for matching with
(5.3). Note that the second derivatives of F, and therefore the tensor NIJ
78

which enters into defining the scalar metric, do not change. The only bosonic
term affected by the transformation is the scalar sigma model term, where
the overall sign flips:
¯ J N = −∂ X̃ I ∂ m X̃
¯JN ,
∂m X I ∂ m X J NIJ = (−e)(−ē)∂m X̃ I ∂ m X̃
IJ
m
IJ
where we used that eē = −e2 = −1. Thus changing the vector multiplet

representation from one Euclidean N = 2 superalgebra to a different, but

isomorphic one flips the relative sign between scalar and vector terms.

For clarification we emphasize that while the use of the para-complex
unit e is convenient for stressing the analogy with complex target space geometries, it is not essential for understanding the sign flip. As explained in
detail in [16], one can can equivalently work with so-called adapted coordiI = σ I ± bI , which are real lightcone coordinates. In this formalism
nates X±

one uses standard chiral projectors for fermions, and instead of a paraholomorphic prepotential there are two real prepotentials F± (X± ), which

are, in general, independent functions. This avoids using the para-complex

unit e. But the scalar manifold carries a para-complex structure irrespective
of whether we use para-holomorphic or real coordinates. By rewriting the
action of multiplication by e from para-holomorphic to real coordinates
I
I
I
eX I = e(σ I + ebI ) = bI + eσ I ⇒ X±
= (σ I ± bI ) → X̃±
= (bI ± σ I ) = ±X±
,

we see that this indeed induces a relative sign between X+ and X− , and a
change in the sign of the scalar kinetic term:
I m J
I m J
∂m X+
∂ X− NIJ = −∂m X̃+
∂ X̃− NIJ .

We remark that our transformation is different from the one advocated in
[14], which is a duality-like rotation of the field equations combined with
multiplying the vector (X I , FI ) by e. This transformation flips the sign of
the vector term, while the extra factor e has the effect of keeping the sign
of the scalar term the same. While the net effect on the bosonic Lagrangian
79

differs from our transformation only by an overall sign, their transformation
is non-local, and was interpreted as a strong-weak coupling duality. In contrast, our transformation is local, works for the off-shell representation and
the Lagrangian, includes fermionic terms, and is induced by an isomorphism
between two Euclidean N = 2 superalgebras that arise from dimensionally

reducing five-dimensional supersymmetry algebras.

When listing our Lagrangians we have fixed the overall sign of the Lagrangian by the convention that the sign of the vector term is always negative, so that relative signs show up in front of the scalar term. The two fourdimensional Euclidean supergravity theories discussed in [14] by the sign of
the vector term, while the scalar and Einstein-Hilbert term have the same
sign. While the full treatment of supergravity in the superconformal approach requires working out the Weyl multiplet in arbitrary signature, we remark that the Einstein-Hilbert term will have a prefactor −e(X I F̄I −FI X̄ I ),

which is then fixed to a constant value by imposing the so-called D-gauge.

This term changes sign under the redefinition X̃ I = −eX I , thus giving rise
to the same pattern of relative signs as in [14].
5.6.2

Neutral signature

Neutral signature can be realized by the reductions (2, 3) → (2, 2) and
(3, 2) → (2, 2), which are of Type 3 and of Type 4, respectively. Since

the five-dimensional theories are related by going from a mostly plus to a
mostly minus convention for the metric, we expect them to be equivalent.
In fact, we have proved in Section 3.3 that there is a unique neutral signature N = 2 superalgebra up to isomorphism, and therefore both theories

should be related by a field redefinition. Using the explicit expressions given

in Sections 4.2.5, 4.2.6 and 4.3.4 it is straightforward to work out the field
redefinition explicitly along the same lines as in the previous section for
Euclidean signature. As there are no new features, we refrain from giving
details.
80

5.6.3

Minkowski signature

Here we have to consider the reductions (1, 4) → (1, 3), (2, 3) → (1, 3) and
(4, 1) → (3, 1), (3, 2) → (3, 1). The four-dimensional signatures (1, 3) and
(3, 1) are related by going from a mostly plus to a mostly minus convention

from the metric, and from Section 3.2 we know that there are two classes
of non-isomorphic N = 2 superalgebras: the standard one with compact

R-symmetry U(2) and the twisted (or type-*) one with non-compact Rsymmetry group U(1, 1). Since the five-dimensional theories in signature

(1, 3), (3, 1) have R-symmetry SU(2), while those in signature (2, 3), (3, 2)
have R-symmetry SU(1, 1), we see that while reductions from Minkowski
signature to Minkowski signature give (of course) a realization of the standard supersymmetry algebra, we can obtain the twisted Minkowski signature
supersymmetry algebra by reducing five-dimensional theories with two timelike directions. Looking at the respective Lagrangians we see that this time
the relative sign between scalar and vector terms immediately distinguishes
both cases. Since in Minkowski signature these signs are tied to the kinetic
energy of scalar and vector fields being positive or negative, it is clear that
they have invariant physical meaning. In contrast, in Euclidean and neutral
signature we have seen that these signs can be changed by local field redefinitions relating representations of distinct but isomorphic supersymmetry
algebras.
In [15] the bosonic Lagrangians and Killing spinor equations of two
N = 2 Lorentzian supergravity theories differing by the sign of the vector

term relative to the scalar term and also relative to the Einstein-Hilbert
term were obtained by dimensional reduction of five dimensional supergravity with one or two time-like dimensions. This is consistent with our
results, and we expect that the theory with inverted sign for the vector
term realizes the N = 2 supersymmetry algebra with R-symmetry group
U(1, 1). In particular, we expect that upon coupling to supergravity the
Einstein Hilbert term will have the same sign relative to the vector term as
81

the scalar term, because within the superconformal formalism the EinsteinHilbert term arises from a term of the form Dm X I D m X̄ J NIJ (X, X̄), where
Dm is the covariant derivative with respect to superconformal transformations. Since the Einstein-Hilbert term also obtains a contribution from the
superconformal hypermultiplet sector, a full derivation will require to formulate hypermultiplets and the Weyl multiplet in arbitrary signature, which
we leave to future work.

Conclusions

In this paper we have classified all N = 2 supersymmetry algebras in four

dimensions, and, by dimensional reduction of five-dimensional theories in

arbitrary signature, we have provided two off-shell vector multiplet representations and the associated Lagrangians for each four-dimensional signature. We have seen that the relative sign between scalar and vector terms is
conventional in Euclidean and neutral signature, but discriminates between
two inequivalent supersymmetry algebras in Lorentz signature.
Since the vector spaces of superbrackets have been constructed in [10]
for all dimensions and signatures, carrying out a full classification appears
feasible along the lines of the present paper. This would then also include
the case of signature (1, 1), which was excluded from Theorem 1. Such a
classification should also list the corresponding R-symmetry groups and BPS
extensions, the latter based on the results of [11]. Moreover, it is desirable
to more directly relate the formalism used in [10, 11] to the language used in
the physics literature. This would include a description of the basis of superadmissible forms using the matrices A, B, C and relating spinor modules to
doubled spinor modules, as we have done in this paper for four-dimensional
N = 2 supersymmetry algebras.

Part of this programme will be addressed in an upcoming paper [20]

which will develop an extension of the doubled spinor formalism to provide

82

realizations of N -extended supersymmetry algebras in arbitrary dimension
and signature, and for any N , with explicit separation of the actions of

the Lorentz and of the R-symmetry group, thus making R-symmetry mani-

fest. Regarding physical applications further steps will include hypermultiplets, and Weyl multiplets, thus facilitating the coupling to supergravity. So
far off-shell formulations of five- and four-dimensional N = 2 supergravity
within the superconformal approach are available in signature (1, 3),(1, 4)

and (0, 4) [21, 22, 23]. This formalism allows to include higher curvature
terms through explicit dependence of the prepotential on the Weyl multiplet. Following the strategy of [12] and of the present paper, it should be
possible to extend existing results to arbitrary signature. This would allow
one to extend the study of BPS solutions with higher derivative terms to
arbitrary signature. In the past years there has been work on the classification of four-dimensional BPS solutions both in Euclidean signature, see for
example [24], [25], and in neutral signature, see for example [26, 27], and
as well on so-called phantom solutions of Lorentzian signature theories with
flipped gauge kinetic terms [28, 29, 30].
More generally, we expect that further developing the approach used in
[12] and in the present paper will be useful for exploring the extended network of string and M-theories across dimensions and signatures. In particular it should provide a new perspective on generalized Killing spinor equations and non-standard supergravity theories, which have been discussed under names such as ‘fake-/pseudo-Killing spinor equations’ and ‘fake-/pseudosupergravity,’ following [31, 32, 33], see also [34] for an overview and more
references. It seems clear that fake-/pseudo-supersymmetry is trelated to
existence of de Sitter and type-* superalgebras, non-compact R-symmetries
and their gaugings, and time-like T-duality [5, 35, 36], the common feature
being the analytic continuation of ‘conventional’ theories and Killing spinor
equations. Therefore a more unified picture requires a systematic way of
dealing with complexification and reality conditions. In [37, 38] it was shown
83

that all maximal supergravities in ten and eleven dimensions arise from contractions of different real forms of a complex ortho-symplectic Lie superalgebra. Our approach is similar in spirit but instead of ortho-symplectic Lie
superalgbras it works directly with Poincaré Lie superalgebras, it allows to
study the space of all possible superbrackets, and it provides a new way
of dealing with complexification and reality conditions through the doubled
spinor formalism.

Clifford algebras
Conventions for γ-matrices

The real Clifford algebra Clt,s is represented by matrices γ µ , µ = 1, . . . t+s =
n satisfying
{γ µ , γ ν } = 2η µν 1 , (η µν ) = diag(−1, . . . , −1, 1, . . . 1) .
This is the same convention as in [16, 12], which differs from [39] by a relative
sign in the defining relation of the Clifford algebra, and a relative sign in
the definition of η µν . The net effect is that Clt,s refers to the same real
associative algebra.

84

The γ-matrices are chosen such that they are either Hermitian or antiHermitian matrices:
(γ µ )† =

(

−γ µ , µ = 1, . . . t,

γµ ,

µ = t + 1, . . . t + s .

We will refer to the anti-Hermitian γ-matrices as time-like and to the Hermitian γ-matrices as space-like, though for physics purposes we take min{t, s}
to be the number of dimensions interpreted as time. This reflects that we
conventionally prefer the ‘mostly plus’ convention for Minkowski signature.
There exist matrices A, B, C which relate the γ-matrices to the Hermitian conjugate, complex conjugate and transposed matrices [40, 16]:
(γ µ )† = (−1)T Aγ µ A−1 ,
(γ µ )∗ = (−1)t τ Bγ µ B −1 ,
(γ µ )T

(A.1)

= τ Cγ µ C −1 ,

where σ, τ ∈ {±1}. The parameters σ, τ are related to the parameters ε, η

used in [40] by σ = −ε and τ = −η. Note that σ = σ(C) and τ = τ (C) are

the symmetry and type of the Spin0 (t, s)-invariant complex bilinear form
(‘Majorana bilinear form’)
C(λ, χ) = λT Cχ
on S defined by the charge conjugation matrix C. We choose a representation
where C is Hermitian and unitary, which is always possible [40]:
C −1 = C † = C .
The matrix A defines the Spin0 (t, s)-invariant sesquilinear form (‘Dirac
sesquilinear form’)
A(λ, χ) = λ† Aχ
on S. In Minkowski signature A is proportional to the time-like γ-matrix.
For general signature we choose the product of all time-like γ-matrices, with
85

index in the lower position:
A = γ1 · · · γt ,
where γµ = ηµν γ ν . For signature (0, n) we take A = 1. We note that
A† = (−1)t(t+1)/2 A = A−1 = (−1)t γt · · · γ1 .
We choose the matrix B as B := (CA−1 )T . It satisfies
BB † = 1 , BB ∗ = ±1

(A.2)

and therefore defines either a real structure or a quaternionic structure on
the complex spinor module S. We note that if we multiply B by a phase
α ∈ C, |α| = 1, the matrix Bα = αB still satisfies (A.2), and defines a real
or quaternionic structure.
The volume element
ω = γ1 · · · γt+s
of the real Clifford algebra Clt,s satisfies
2

ω =

(

(−1)t 1 ,

for t + s = 1, 4 mod 4 ,

(−1)t+1 1 , for t + s = 2, 3 mod 4 ,

(A.3)

and
γµ ω = ωγµ (−1)t+s+1 .
One can therefore define a matrix γ∗ with γ∗2 =
γ∗ = ±iω, depending on (A.3).

1 by setting γ∗ = ±ω or

In odd dimensions, S is irreducible and γ∗ commutes with all γ-matrices,

therefore γ∗ ∝

1. In this case γ∗ distinguishes the two inequivalent rep-

resentations of the complex Clifford algebra Clt,s . From the physics point
of view the choice of a representation is conventional because both Clifford
representations induce equivalent representations of Spin(t, s). In even dimensions γ∗ anticommutes with all γ-matrices. The complex spinor module
86

S is reducible and decomposes into complex semi-spinor modules S± , which
are irreducible Clt+s -modules with projection operators
Π± =

1
(1 ± γ∗ ) : S → S± .
2

The chirality matrix γ∗ generalises the ‘γ5 ’-matrix of four-dimensional Minkowski
space to arbitrary dimension and signature.
In odd dimensions, the charge conjugation matrix C is unique up to
equivalence, while in four dimensions there are always two inequivalent
charge conjugation matrices C± which are distinguished by their type τ .
Following physicist conventions [40] we use the notation C± = C∓τ , i.e.
τ (C± ) = ∓τ . The existence of at least two inequivalent charge conjugation

matrices follows from the observation that if C is a charge conjugation matrix, so is γ∗ C, which has the opposite value of τ . In five dimension the
charge conjugation matrix C has invariants σ = −1 and τ = +1. In four

dimensions we choose C− := C, with σ− = σ = −1 and τ− = τ = +1 and

C+ = γ∗ C− with σ+ = −1 and τ+ = −τ = −1 as the two inequivalent

charge conjugation matrices.

Since we have two inequivalent charge conjugation matrices C± in even

dimensions, we also have two inequivalent ‘B-matrices’, B± := (C± A−1 )T .
The matrices C± and B± are related to each other through multiplication
by γ∗ . To obtain explicit relations, we use that in dimensions divisible by
four we can choose a representation where C± commute with γ∗ , and where
γ∗ is real and symmetric [40]. In such a representation it is straightforward

87

Dimensional reduction of the matrices A, B and C

For any reduction from 5 to 4 dimensions we take the four-dimensional
charge conjugation matrix C− to be equal to the five-dimensional charge
conjugation matrix C:
C = C− .
We choose a representation where C± = γ∗ C∓ = C∓ γ∗ ,
The relation between A-matrices is:13

A(t,s) = Γ′1 · · · Γ′t = A(t,s−1) = Γ′1 A(t−1,s) ,

12
In even dimensions not divisible by four there are similar relations which differ from
those given here at most by signs. In this paper we only need explicit expressions in four
dimensions.
13
The relations for A and A−1 apply in any number of dimensions.

88

which implies
(A(t,s) )−1 = (−1)t Γ′t · · · Γ′1 = (A(t,s−1) )−1 = (−1)t Γ′1 (A(t−1,s) )−1 .
In four dimensions we have two B-matrices. Using that σ− = σ+ = −1 we

have γ∗ B± = (−1)t B∓ and B± γ∗ = B∓ . We choose γ∗ = Γ5 for space-like

and γ∗ = iΓ′1 for time-like reductions. Then the space-like reduction of the
five-dimensional B-matrix is B− ,
(t,s−1)

B (t,s) = (C(A(t,s) )−1 )T = (C− (A(t,s) )−1 )T = B−

,

while the time-like reduction of the five-dimensional B-matrix is proportional to B+ :
B (t,s) = (C− (−1)t Γ′1 A(t−1,s) )T = −i(−1)t (C− γ∗ A(t−1,s) )T

The map (C− ⊗ ε, (λi )∗ = αB+ λj ηji ) ↔ (C+ ⊗ δ, (ϕi )∗ = αB+ ϕj ηji )
We start with the pair (C− ⊗ ε, (λi )∗ = αB+ λj ηji ) which we obtain from the
reduction (2, 3) → (1, 3). The map defined by (4.7) exchanges C− ⊗ ε with

is a matrix operating on the auxiliary space C4 . The matrix T satisfies
T2 =

1, T = T T . It combines the map (4.6) which acts differently on

positive and negative chirality, with a basis change induced by a basis change
on the auxiliary space C2 of doubled spinors.
The map (C− ⊗ ε, (Ψi )∗ = αB+ Ψi ) ↔ (C+ ⊗ δ, (Ωi )∗ = αB− Ωj εji )
Next we apply the map (4.6) to the pair (C− ⊗ ε, (Ψi )∗ = αB+ Ψi ), where
Ψi satisfies the standard Majorana condition.

Ωi+ = Ψi+ , Ωi− = Ψj− εji ⇔ Ψi− = −Ωj− εji .
Taking the complex conjugates we obtain:
(Ωi+ )∗ = (Ψi+ )∗ = αB+ Ψi− = −αB+ Ωj− εji = αB− Ωj− εji

(Ωi− )∗ = (Ψj− )∗ εji = αB+ Ψj+ εji = αB− Ψj+ εji ,

where we used (4.12). Thus (Ωi )∗ = αB− Ωj εji , which shows that the map
Bil exchanges standard Majorana spinors with symplectic Majorana Weyl
spinors. In twice doubled spinor notation, the relation between (ΨI ) =
(Ψ1+ , Ψ2+ , Ψ1− , Ψ2− ) and (ΩI ) = (Ω1+ , Ω2+ , Ω1− , Ω2− ) is given by
ΩI = SJI ΨJ ,
where S = (SJI ) was defined in (4.6).
90

The map (C+ ⊗ δ, (ϕi )∗ = B+ ϕj ηji ) ↔ (C+ ⊗ δ, (Ωi )∗ = βB− Ωj εji )
We claim that it is possible to exchange the off-diagonal Majorana condition
with the symplectic Majorana condition while preserving the vector-valued
bilinear form.
The first way to establish this isomorphism is to rewrite Majorana spinors
in terms of symplectic Majorana spinors:

Superbrackets in signature (2,2)

Here we work out explicitly how to relate the eight real superbrackets which
can be defined in the doubled spinor formalism can be mapped to one another.

92

Exchanging B+ and B−
Let us assume that spinors λi , Ψi satisfy the reality conditions
(λi )∗ = αB− λj Nji ,
(Ψi )∗ = βB+ Ψj Nji ,
where Nji can be either ηji or δji . We take the same map as in (0, 4):
1
1
λi = √ (1 − iγ∗ )Ψi ⇔ Ψi = √ (1 + iγ∗ )λi .
2
2
Since the B-matrices are signature-dependent, we need to check that the
reality conditions are mapped to each other:

which is the correct reality condition for β = −iα. Note that in signature
(2, 2) A = γ0 γ1 so that γ∗ B− = B− γ∗ = B+ . The computation which shows

the invariance of the bilinear form is independent of the signature and is the
same as for signature (0, 4).
Exchanging δij and ηij
We use the twice doubled notation since it turns out that the required transformations needs to act chirally. Suppose λi satisfy the standard Majorana
condition with respect to one of the two real structures:
(λi± )∗ = αB± λj± .
In four dimensions B± γ∗ = B∓ for all signatures, hence:
(λi± )∗ = ±αB∓ λj± .

(ϕi± )∗ = αB∓ ηij ϕj± .

Thus the combined transformation F W maps Majorana spinors with respect
to B± to twisted Majorana spinors with respect to B∓ . But we have already
seen that we can subsequently exchange B+ and B− , so that we can exchange
δij and ηij without changing the B-matrix.
Changing the bilinear form
To relate the complex bilinear forms C− ⊗ ε and C+ ⊗ δ we can take the map

defined by (4.6). While this always maps the complex bilinear forms to one
another, we have to check how it acts on the reality conditions. Suppose
that
(λi± )∗ = αB± Nij λj± ,
where Nij can be either δij or ηij . Define
Ψi+ = λi+ , Ψi− = εij λj− .

94

Then
(Ψi+ )∗

=

αB± Nij Ψj+

,

(Ψi− )∗

=

−αB± εij Njk εkl Ψl−

=

(

αB± δij Ψj− ,

−αB± ηij Ψj− .

Using that B± Ψi± = ±B∓ Ψi± this can be rewritten:
(
αB± Ψi± ,
Nij = δij ,
(Ψi± )∗ =
j
αB∓ Ψ± ηji , Nij = ηij .
Thus while the standard Majorana conditions are preserved, for the twisted
Majorana condition B+ and B− get exchanged. However we have already
found a map which just exchanges B± . Therefore the two complex bilinear
forms, the two B-matrices B+ and B− , and δij and ηij can be exchanged
separately and all eight real superbrackets can be mapped to one another.
