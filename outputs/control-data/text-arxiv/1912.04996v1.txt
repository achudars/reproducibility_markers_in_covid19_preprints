Abstract. We present classification and explicit form of all constant solutions of
the Yang-Mills equations with SU(2) gauge symmetry for an arbitrary constant nonAbelian current in pseudo-Euclidean space Rp,q of arbitrary finite dimension n = p + q.
We use the method of hyperbolic singular value decomposition and the method of twosheeted covering of orthogonal group by spin group to do this. Nonconstant solutions
of the Yang-Mills equations can be considered in the form of series of perturbation
theory. The results of this paper are new and can be used to solve some problems in
particle physics, in particular, to describe physical vacuum and to fully understand a
quantum gauge theory. The results of this paper generalize our previous results for
the case of arbitrary Euclidean case Rn .

Keywords: Yang-Mills equations, hyperbolic singular value decomposition, SU(2), cubic

1. Introduction.
The law of elementary particles physics is given by quantum gauge theories [6]. We
need exact solutions of classical Yang-Mills equations to describe the vacuum structure
of the theory and to fully understand a quantum gauge theory [17]. The well-known
classes of solutions of the Yang-Mills equations are described in detail in classical papers
[27, 11, 18, 4, 26, 3, 2] and various reviews [1, 29], etc.
In this paper, we present all constant solutions of the Yang-Mills equations with
SU(2) gauge symmetry for an arbitrary constant non-Abelian current in pseudoEuclidean space Rp,q of arbitrary finite dimension n = p + q. The case of arbitrary
Euclidean space Rn , which is much simpler, was considered in the previous work [23].
The presentation is given independently. The relevance of the study is explained by the
fact that the Yang-Mills equations describe electroweak interactions in the case of the
Lie group SU(2). The results of this paper for an arbitrary current are consistent with
the results [21, 22] for zero current and arbitrary compact Lie algebra. The results of this
paper are new and can be used to solve some problems in particle physics, in particular,
to describe physical vacuum [10, 12] and to fully understand a quantum gauge theory.
Covariantly constant solutions of the Yang-Mills equations are discussed in
[14, 16, 25], constant solutions of the Yang-Mills-Proca equations are discussed in [15]
using Clifford algebra formalism.
2. The main ideas.
Let us consider pseudo-Euclidean space Rp,q of arbitrary finite dimension n = p + q,
p, q ≥ 1, n ≥ 2. We denote Cartesian coordinates by xµ , µ = 1, . . . , n and partial
derivatives by ∂µ = ∂/∂xµ . The metric tensor of Rp,q is given by the diagonal matrix
η = diag(1, . . . , 1, −1, . . . , −1) = kηµν k = kη µν k,
| {z } | {z }
p

p + q = n.

(1)

q

We have the following system of algebraic equations for the constant solutions of
the Yang-Mills equation in the case of the Lie group SU(2):
[Aµ , [Aµ , Aν ]] = J ν ,

ν = 1, . . . , n,

(2)

where Aν and J ν are components of tensor fields with values in the Lie algebra su(2).
We take the basis of su(2) τ a = 2i1 σ a , a = 1, 2, 3, where σ a are Pauli matrices, with
[τ a , τ b ] = ǫabc τ c , where ǫabc is the antisymmetric Levi-Civita symbol, and represent the
potential and the current in the form
Aµ = Aµa τ a ,

J µ = J µa τ a ,

Aµa , J µa ∈ R.

We obtain the following system of 3n equations (k = 1, 2, 3, ν = 1, 2, . . . , n) for 3n
expressions Aνk and 3n expressions J νk
Aµc Aµa Aνb ǫabd ǫcdk = J νk ,

ν = 1, . . . , n,

k = 1, 2, 3.

We can consider (3) as the system of equations for the components of two real matrices
An×3 = ||Aνk || and Jn×3 = ||J νk ||. The case of arbitrary Euclidean space has been
considered in [23]. Now we are interested in the case of arbitrary pseudo-Euclidean
space Rp,q , p ≥ 1, q ≥ 1.
We use the method of hyperbolic singular value decomposition (HSVD) in our
considerations. There are several classical papers on the HSVD [19, 20, 5, 28, 13]. The
generalization of HSVD without the use of hyperexchange matrices in presented in [24].
This new formulation of HSVD naturally incudes the ordinary SVD [7, 8], which is
also widely used in different applications. Let us formulate this new formulation of the
HSVD for the case of real matrices A ∈ Matn×N (R). We denote any zero block of matrix
by Θ.
Theorem 1 [24] Assume (1), p + q = n. For an arbitrary matrix A ∈ Matn×N (R),
there exist matrices R ∈ O(N) and L ∈ O(p, q) such that




Θ Θ Θ Θ 

where the first block of the matrix ΣA has p rows and the second block has q rows,
Xx and Yy are diagonal matrices of corresponding dimensions x and y with all positive
uniquely determined diagonal elements (up to a permutation), Id is the identity matrix
of dimension d.
Moreover, choosing R, one can swap columns of the matrix ΣA . Choosing L, one
can swap rows in individual blocks but not across blocks. Thus we can always arrange
diagonal elements of the matrices Xx and Yy in decreasing order.
Here we have
d = rank(A) − rank(AT ηA),

x + y = rank(AT ηA),

x is the number of positive eigenvalues of the matrix AT ηA, y is the number of negative
eigenvalues of the matrix AT ηA.
Let us call ΣA (4), where all diagonal elements of the matrices Xx and Yy are
positive and in decreasing order, the canonical form of the matrix A ∈ Matn×N (R).
The canonical form is uniquely determined for any matrix A ∈ Matn×N (R), the
corresponding matrices L and R are not uniquely determined. One can find the
algorithm for computing the HSVD in [24]. For arbitrary matrix A ∈ Matn×N (R),
we can always find the matrices L, R, and ΣA from the formulation of Theorem 1.
Lemma 1 The system of equations (3) is invariant under the transformation
A → Á = AP,

J → J´ = JP,

P ∈ SO(3)

and under the transformation
J → J´ = QJ,

A → Â = QA,

Q ∈ O(p, q).

Proof.
The proof is similar to the proof of Lemma 1 in [23]. The system (2) is
invariant under the transformation
Áµ = S −1 Aµ S,

J´ν = S −1 J ν S,

S ∈ G = SU(2),

because of the gauge invariance and the fact that an element S ∈ SU(2) does not depend
on x ∈ Rp,q here.
Let us use the theorem on two-sheeted covering of the orthogonal group SO(3) by
the spin group Spin(3) ≃ SU(2). For arbitrary matrix P = ||pab || ∈ SO(3), there exist
two matrices ±S ∈ SU(2) such that
S −1 τ a S = pab τ b .
We conclude that the system (3) is invariant under the transformation
A´µ = S −1 Aµ τ a S = Aµ S −1 τ a S = Aµ pa τ b = A´µ τ b ,
A´µ = Aµ pa ,

J´µ = S −1 J µa τ a S = J µa S −1 τ a S = J µa pab τ b = J´µb τ b ,

J´µb = J µa pab .

The Yang-Mills equations are invariant under the orthogonal transformations of
coordinates. Namely, let us consider the transformation xµ → xˆµ = qνµ xν , where
Q = ||qνµ || ∈ O(p, q). The system (3) is invariant under the transformation
Âν = qµν Aµ = qµν Aµa τ a = Aˆνa τ a ,
Jˆν = qµν J µ = qµν J µa τ a = Jˆνa τ a ,

Aˆνa = qµν Aµa ,
Jˆνa = qµν J µa .

The lemma is proved. 
Combining gauge and orthogonal transformations, we conclude that the system (3)
is invariant under the transformation

Aνb → Aˆνb = qµν Aµa pab , An×3 → Ân×3 = Qn×n An×3 P3×3 ,

Jbν → Jˆνb = qµν J µa pab , Jn×3 → Jˆn×3 = Qn×n Jn×3 P3×3
for any P ∈ SO(3) and Q ∈ O(p, q).
Theorem 2 Let A = ||Aνk ||, J = ||J νk || satisfy the system of 3n cubic equations (3).
Then:
1) There exist matrices P ∈ SO(3) and Q ∈ O(p, q) such that the matrix QAP is
in the canonical form (with parameters xA , yA , dA )

where β ∈ R \ {0}; elements of the diagonal matrices K, L, M, N are arbitrary nonzero
real numbers.
Proof.
1) Let the system (3) has some solution Aµa , J µa . Let us synchronize gauge
transformation and orthogonal transformation such that A = ||Aµa || is in the canonical
form (4). Namely, we take P ∈ SO(3) and Q ∈ O(p, q) such that QAP = ΣA .

Note that we can always find the matrix P ∈ SO(3) from the special orthogonal
group in the HSVD. If it has the determinant −1, then we can change the sign of all
elements of the matrices P and Q.
Note that the matrix ΣA has at most one nonzero entry in each row. We must take
a = c in (3) and b = k 6= a = c for Levi-Civita symbol to obtain nonzero summands.
The product of two Levi-Civita symbols in (3) equals −1. We obtain the following
expression
3
n
´ ν X X µµ ´ µ 2
−Â k
η (Â a )
a=1;6=k µ=1

Note that for each fixed k, we have the sum of ± squares of all elements of the matrix
´
Â but not in the k-th column. Summands of identity blocks Id are reduced because of
different signs. Thus we have no more than two summands in this sum for each pair ν
and k.
´ν
´ν
´ νi
We see that if Â k = 0, then Jˆ k = 0. If we have two elements Â k = 1 for some
´ νi
i = 1, 2, then the corresponding elements Jˆ , i = 1, 2 must be the same (not necessarily
k

equal to 1). That is why other identical diagonal blocks αId , α ∈ R are allowed for
the matrix QJP instead of blocks Id . Finally, we obtain specific form of the matrix
QJP from the statement of the theorem and the system of no more than three different
equations

a=1;6=k µ=1

2) - 3) We can change the matrices Q ∈ O(p, q) and P ∈ SO(3) such that the new
matrix QJP will be in the canonical form because:
(i) we can change the order of columns of the matrix QJP by multiplying P by the
± permutation matrix (see Theorem 1 and [24] for details), which belongs to the
group SO(3);
(ii) we can change the order of rows in each of two blocks of the matrix QJP by
multiplying Q by the matrix of the form
!
S1 Θ
∈ O(p, q),
Θ S2
where S1 and S2 are permutation matrices of the order p and q respectively (see
Theorem 1 and [24]);
(iii) we can change signs of some elements of the matrices Z and W by multiplying the
matrix Q ∈ O(p, q) by the diagonal matrix with ±1 on the diagonal, which is also
belongs to the group O(p, q);
(iv) the blocks αId (in the cases α 6= 0 and α 6= 1) can be reduced to the blocks Id by

Using the same transformations (i) - (iv) for the matrix A, we obtain the specific form
of this matrix from the statement of the theorem. Namely, the order of columns is
changing respectively, the order of rows in each of two blocks of the matrix QAP is
changing respectively, some elements of the matrices X and Y become negative. In the
cases α 6= 0 and α 6= 1, the blocks IdA are multiplied by β := α1 . 
Remark 1. Suppose we have known matrix Jn×3 = ||J νk || and want to obtain all
solutions An×3 = ||Aνk || of the system (3). Let us denote the canonical form of the
known matrix J for some Q ∈ O(p, q), P ∈ SO(3) by
QJP = ΣJ .
We use the statements 2) and 3) of Theorem 2 and Lemma 1. The system (3) takes the
following form under the transformation (5) of no more than 3 independent equations
for (each column) k = 1, 2, 3 and unique corresponding ν = ν(k) (corresponding row):

η µµ (Aµa )2 = J νk .

Below we present a general solution of the system (6) in different cases.
Finally, we obtain all solutions ΨA of the system (3) but in some other system of
coordinates depending on Q ∈ O(p, q) and with gauge fixing depending on P ∈ SO(3).
The matrix
A = Q−1 ΨA P −1
will be solution of the system (3) in the original system of coordinates and with the
original gauge fixing.
A −1 −1
, for all Q1 ∈ O(p, q) and P1 ∈ SO(3)
Remark 2. Note that Q−1 Q−1
1 Ψ P1 P
J
J
such that Q1 Σ P1 = Σ , will be also solutions of the system (3) in the original system
of coordinates and with the original gauge fixing because of Lemma 1.
Let us give one example. If the matrix J = 0, then all singular values of this matrix
equal zero and we can take identity matrices Q = In , P = I3 for its HSVD. We solve the
system (6) for J = 0 and obtain all solutions ΨA of this system. We have Q1 ΣJ P1 = ΣJ
for ΣJ = 0 and any Q1 ∈ O(p, q), P1 ∈ SO(3). Therefore, the matrices Q1 ΨA P1 for all
Q1 ∈ O(p, q) and P1 ∈ SO(3) will be solutions of the system (3) because of Lemma 1.
Remark 3. In the case of constant potential of the Yang-Mills field, we have the
following expression for the strength
F µν = −[Aµ , Aν ] = −[Aµa τ a , Aνb τ b ] = −Aµa Aνb ǫabc τ c = F µνc τ c .

(7)

For each solution, we calculate nonzero components of the strength (we write only one
for each pair F µν = −F νµ ). Also we calculate the invariant F 2 = Fµν F µν , which is
present in the Lagrangian of the Yang-Mills field. We have
1 X µµ νν µν 2
η η (Fa ) I2 .
F2 = −
2 µ<ν
Because of the equations (6), we have nonzero F 6= 0 only for the solutions with
dA + xA + yA ≥ 2, and we have nonzero F 2 6= 0 only for the solutions with xA + yA ≥ 2.
Let us consider the cases n = 2 and n ≥ 3 separately below.
3. The results for the case n = 2: R1,1 .
Let us consider the case of pseudo-Euclidean space of dimension n = 2 (p = q = 1). Note
that two dimensional Yang-Mills theory is discussed in many papers ([9] and others).
This case is much simpler than the case n ≥ 3, but we discuss this case in details for
the sake of completeness and to show our method, which is discussed above.
The parameters xJ , yJ , dJ of the matrix J can take the values 0, 1 such that
xJ + yJ + 2dJ ≤ 2.
3.1. The case dJ = 0.
Let us consider the nondegenerate case dJ = 0. We will see below that the problem
actually is reduced to the solution of the following system
b1 (b2 )2 = j1 ,

b2 (b1 )2 = j2 ,

(8)

where b1 = ±a1 , b2 = ±a2 for some potentials a1 , a2 . The general solution of the system
(8) is discussed in [23].
Lemma 2 [23] The system of equations (8) has the following general solution:
(i) in the case j1 = j2 = 0, has solutions (b1 , 0), (0, b2 ) for all b1 , b2 ∈ R;

(ii) in the cases j1 = 0, j2 6= 0; j1 6= 0, j2 = 0, has no solutions;

(iii) in the case j1 6= 0, j2 6= 0, has the unique solution

For all these potentials ΨA , we have zero strength F = 0. This also follows from the

the cases of other signatures. We will show it below.

The results are summarized in Table 1. In the case n = 2, p = q = 1, the Yang-Mills
equations have nonzero strength F 6= 0 only in the case
dJ = 0,

xJ = yJ = 1,

i.e. when rank(J) = rank(J T ηJ) = 2, and the number of positive eigenvalues and the
number of negative eigenvalues of the matrix J T ηJ is the same and equals 1.

4. The results for the case Rp,q , p + q = n ≥ 3, p ≥ 1, q ≥ 1.
Let us consider the case n = p + q ≥ 3, p ≥ 1, q ≥ 1 for known Jn×3 = ||J νk || and
unknown An×3 = ||Aνk ||. Let us denote the elements of the diagonal blocks XxJ and YyJ
of the matrix ΣJ by j1 , j2 , j3 and the elements of the diagonal blocks K, L, M, N of the
matrix ΨA (see Theorem 2) by a1 , a2 , a3 .
4.1. The case dJ = 0.
In the case dJ = 0, the problem actually is reduced to the solution of the following two
systems of three cubic equations:
b1 ((b2 )2 + (b3 )2 ) = j1 ,
b2 ((b1 )2 + (b3 )2 ) = j2 ,

(15)

b3 ((b1 )2 + (b2 )2 ) = j3
and
b1 ((b2 )2 − (b3 )2 ) = j1 ,

b2 ((b1 )2 − (b3 )2 ) = j2 ,
2

(16)

2

b3 ((b1 ) + (b2 ) ) = j3 .

The systems (15), (16) have the following symmetry. Suppose that (b1 , b2 , b3 ) is a
solution of (15) or (16) for known (j1 , j2 , j3 ). If we change the sign of some jk , k = 1, 2, 3,
then we must change the sign of the corresponding bk , k = 1, 2, 3. Without loss of
generality, we can assume that all expressions jk , k = 1, 2, 3, in (15) and (16) are
nonnegative. In (15), the expressions bk , k = 1, 2, 3 will be nonnegative too. In (16),
the expression b3 will be nonnegative, the expressions b1 and b2 will be arbitrary real
numbers.
The general solution of the system (15) and its symmetries are discussed in [23],
where we obtain the same system in the case of arbitrary Euclidean space Rn . We
remind these statements (Lemmas 3 and 4) here without proof for the convenience of

reader. We present general solution of the system (16) and its symmetries in Lemmas
5 and 6.

is a conserved quantity for a pair of solutions (b1 , b2 , b3 ) and (b′1 , b′2 , b′3 ) of the system
(15), where all numbers b1 , b2 , b3 , b′1 , b′2 , b′3 are nonzero.
Lemma 4 [23] The system of equations (15) with nonnegative parameters j1 ≥ 0,
j2 ≥ 0, j3 ≥ 0 has the following general solution:

Proof.

The detailed proof is given in Appendix A. 

4.1.1. The case dJ = 0, rank(J) = 3. We have the following four subcases 1) xJ = 3,
yJ = 0; 2) xJ = 0, yJ = 3; 3) xJ = 1, yJ = 2; 4) xJ = 2, yJ = 1. It is important which
of the three diagonal elements of the matrix J are from the first p indices and which of
them are from the last q indices, and this depends on xJ and yJ . In different cases, we
obtain different system of equations, because of the signs before the summands (ak )2 ,
k = 1, 2, 3.
We remind that we consider only positive elements j1 , j2 , j3 (they are called
hyperbolic singular values of the matrix J) for simplicity.
In the case dJ = 0, xJ = 3, yJ = 0, we have

−a2 ((a1 )2 + (a3 )2 ) = j2 ,

−a3 ((a1 )2 + (a2 )2 ) = j3 .

This system is reduced to the system (15) using the change of variables bk = −ak ,
k = 1, 2, 3. We have one or two solutions. This depends on the numbers j1 , j2 and j3 .

We must verify all 20 cases for (dA , xA , yA ), 0 ≤ dA , xA , yA ≤ 3, dA + xA + yA ≤ 3. We
have no solutions in 14 cases, and we have solutions in 6 cases. Below we present these
6 cases.
In the case dA = xA = yA = 0, we have zero matrix ΨA = Θ. So, we have trivial
solution A = 0, F = 0, F 2 = 0.

5. Summary for the case of arbitrary Rp,q , p ≥ 1, q ≥ 1.
Let we have the Yang-Mills equations (3) in pseudo-Euclidean space Rp,q , p ≥ 1, q ≥ 1,
with known constant current J µ = J µa τ a and unknown constant potential Aµ = Aµa τ a ,
and the corresponding unknown strength F µν (7).
(i) For the matrix J = ||J µa ||, we can always calculate three parameters dJ , xJ , yJ ,
which are uniquely determined, dJ + xJ + yJ = rank(J), xA is the number of
positive eigenvalues of the matrix J T ηJ, yA is the number of negative eigenvalues
of the matrix J T ηJ, dJ = rank(J) − rank(J T ηJ) (see Theorem 1).

(ii) We can always calculate hyperbolic singular values j1 , j2 , j3 of the matrix J, which
are also uniquely determined. The corresponding matrices Q ∈ O(p, q), P ∈ SO(3)
from hyperbolic SVD are not uniquely determined.

(iii) For the corresponding p, q, dJ , xJ , yJ , j1 , j2 , j3 , we can obtain all solutions of (3),
and they are represented in Tables 2, 3, 4.
(a) The explicit form of these solutions in terms of A and F is given in specific
coordinate system (which is determined by the matrix Q ∈ O(p, q) from
hyperbolic SVD) and specific gauge fixing (which is determined by the matrix
P ∈ SO(3) from hyperbolic SVD, the connection S ∈ SU(3) for gauge fixing is
the two-sheeted covering of P ∈ SO(3)) for each current J.
(b) We can obtain the corresponding solutions in the original system of coordinates
and with the original gauge fixing (see Remarks 1 and 2), using P and Q.
(c) We calculate the invariant F 2 for all constant solutions. It is gauge invariant
and invariant under coordinate transformations, and it is present in the
Lagrangian of the Yang-Mills field.
We summarize results in Tables 2 (nondegenerate case dJ = 0, rank(J) = 3), 3
(degenerate case dJ = 0, rank(J) < 3), and 4 (degenerate case dJ 6= 0). We remind that
we consider only positive numbers j1 , j2 , j3 . They are called hyperbolic singular values
of the matrix J.
Note that in the particular case of Minkowski space R1,3 , not all the cases are
realized. We should take p = 1, q = 3 in Tables 2, 3, and 4.

6. Conclusions.
The main result of this paper is the presentation of all constant solutions of the YangMills equations with SU(2) gauge symmetry for an arbitrary constant current in pseudoEuclidean space of arbitrary finite dimension. Using the invariance of the Yang-Mills
equations under the orthogonal transformations of coordinates and gauge invariance,
we choose a specific system of coordinates and a specific gauge fixing for each constant
current and obtain all constant solutions of the Yang-Mills equations in this system
of coordinates with this gauge fixing, and then in the original system of coordinates
with the original gauge fixing (see Remarks 1 and 2). We prove that the number of
constant solutions of the Yang-Mills equations in terms of the strength F depends on
the parameters dJ , xJ , yJ and hyperbolic singular values of the matrix of current J.
The explicit form of these solutions and the invariant F 2 can always be written using
hyperbolic singular values of the matrix J.
Note that we can consider nonconstant solutions of Yang-Mills equations in the form
of series of perturbation theory using all constant solutions as a zeroth approximation.
The problem reduces to solving systems of linear partial differential equations. This
will allow us to give a local classification of all solutions of the classical SU(2) YangMills equations. The results of this paper are new and can be used to solve some
problems in particle physics, in particular, in describing physical vacuum [1, 10, 12, 17].
In this paper, we discuss mathematical structures and constructions. Relating the
proposed mathematical constructions to real world objects goes beyond the scope of this
investigation. The explicit formulas for constant solutions are fundamental for the Yang-

Mills field and should be interesting for physicists. We plan to obtain classification and
explicit form of all constant solutions of the Dirac-Yang-Mills equations using results of
this paper for the case of Minkowski space. Another interesting task is to obtain results
on all constant solutions of the Yang-Mills equations in the case of the Lie group SU(3),
which is important for describing strong interactions.

Appendix A: Proof of Lemma 6.
The first four cases of Lemma 6 are easily verified.
(v) Let us consider the case j1 = 0, j2 6= 0, j3 6= 0. We have
b1 ((b2 )2 − (b3 )2 ) = 0,

b2 ((b1 )2 − (b3 )2 ) = j2 ,

b3 ((b1 )2 + (b2 )2 ) = j3 .

We obtain b1 = 0 or b2 = ±b3 . In the case b1 = 0, we get one solution

(102)

In the case b2 = b3 , we get
b3 ((b1 )2 − (b3 )2 ) = j2 ,

b3 ((b1 )2 + (b3 )2 ) = j3 .

Adding and subtracting both sides of these equations, we obtain
2b3 (b1 )2 = j2 + j3 ,

2(b3 )3 = j3 − j2 .

If j2 = j3 , then b3 = 0, j2 = −j3 , j2 = j3 = 0, and we obtain a contradiction. If
√
j2 = −j3 , then b1 = 0 or b3 = 0. If b1 = 0, then b2 = b3 = 3 j3 . We already have this
solution (102). If b3 = 0, then j3 − j2 = 0, j2 = j3 = 0, and we obtain a contradiction.
In the case

Note that (103) is equivalent to j3 > j2 .
In the case b2 = −b3 , we get
−b3 ((b1 )2 − (b3 )2 ) = j2 ,

b3 ((b1 )2 + (b3 )2 ) = j3 .

Adding and subtracting both sides of these equations, we obtain
2(b3 )3 = j2 + j3 ,

2b3 (b1 )2 = j3 − j2 .

If j2 = −j3 , then b3 = 0, j2 = j3 , j2 = j3 = 0, and we obtain a contradiction. If j2 = j3 ,

then b1 = 0 or b3 = 0. If b1 = 0, then b2 = −b3 = − 3 j2 . We already have this solution
(102). If b3 = 0, then j2 + j3 = 0, j2 = j3 = 0, and we obtain a contradiction. In the
case

(vi) Let us consider the case of all positive j1 > 0, j2 > 0, j3 > 0. We use the

we get the system for two variables y and z:

42

From the first equation (106), we obtain
(A − y)z 2 = y(Ay − 1).

(108)

Let us consider two cases: A = 1 and A 6= 1.
In the case A = 1, we can rewrite (1−y)z 2 = y(y −1) in the form (1−y)(y +z 2 ) = 0.
If y = 1, then using
the second equation (106), we get 2z = B(1−z 2 ), i.e. z 2 + B2 z−1 = 0.
√
2
We have z = −1± B1+B . If y = −z 2 , then we substitute this expression into the second
equation (106) and obtain z(1 + z 4 ) = B(z 4 − z 2 ), z 5 − Bz 4 + Bz 2 + z = 0. Dividing
√
2
both sides by z 3 and using notation s = z √
− z1 , we get s2 − Bs + 2 = 0, s = B± 2B −8 .
√
2
We have z 2 − sz − 1 = 0 and obtain z = s± 2s +4 for each s. Thus in the case B ≥ 2 2,
we have 2 or 4 additional solutions.
The results for the case A = 1 can be summarized as follows.
If j1 = j2 > 0, j3 > 0, then we have 2 solutions

In the second case, we have also b±

Now let us consider the case A 6= 1. We have A 6= y. Really, suppose that A = y.
Since (108), we get A = 1, i.e. a contradiction. Using (108), we get

z2 =

Dividing both sides by y 3 and using notation t = y +

Let us find extrema of the function f (t): f ′ (t) = 3t2 + 2t( BA − A − A1 ) = 0. The

function has one extremum at the point t = 0 that equals f (0) = − 4B

has one solution 2 < t1 < A + A1 .
Suppose that −2 < T and f (T ) > 0. These conditions take the form (B 2 −A2 −1) <
3A and (B 2 − A2 − 1)3 > 27A2 B 2 . Raising the first inequality in the third degree and
comparing with the second one, we get 27A2 B 2 < 27A3 , i.e. B 2 < A. On the other
hand, the second inequality implies B 2 > A2 + 1. We obtain A2 + 1 < A, A2 − A + 1 < 0,
i.e. a contradiction.
This means that if the cubic equation has another solutions except the first one
t1 > 2, then they are less than −2. Thus all solutions of (112) are suitable for us.

The number of these solutions is from 1 to 3 and it depends on A and B. We have
two solutions in the case f (T ) = 0, i.e. (B 2 − A2 − 1)3 = 27A2 B 2 . We have one
solution in the case (B 2 − A2 − 1)3 < 27A2 B 2 , we have three solutions in the case
(B 2 − A2 − 1)3 > 27A2 B 2 . We can get the explicit form of these solutions using Cardano
formulas.

2
Let us prove that (B 2 −A2 −1)3 > 27A2 B 2 is equivalent to B 3 > A 3 +1. Considering
the equation (B 2 − A2 − 1)3 − 27A2 B 2 = 0 as a cubic equation for B 2 , we can find one
2
of the roots B 2 = (A 3 + 1)3 . We get
(B 2 − A2 − 1)3 − 27A2 B 2 = (B 2 − (a + 1)3 )(B 4 + B 2 ((a + 1)3 − 3(1 + a3 )) + (a2 − a + 1)3 ),

where a := A 3 . This equation has no other roots because the discriminant for the
2
corresponding quadratic equation is negative (we use 0 < a = A 3 6= 1)
D = −27a2 (a − 1)2 < 0.
