ABSTRACT

Galactic outflows are thought to eject baryons back out to the circum-galactic medium
(CGM). Studies based on metal absorption lines (Mg ii in particular) in the spectra
of background quasars indicate that the gas is ejected anisotropically, with galactic
winds likely leaving the host in a bi-conical flow perpendicular to the galaxy disk. In
this paper, we present a detailed analysis of an outflow from a z = 0.7 “green-valley”
galaxy (log(M∗ /M ) = 9.9; SFR = 0.5 M yr−1 ) probed by two background sources
part of the MUSE Gas Flow and Wind (MEGAFLOW) survey. Thanks to a fortuitous
configuration with a background quasar (SDSSJ1358+1145) and a bright background
galaxy at z = 1.4, both at impact parameters of ≈ 15 kpc, we can – for the first
time – probe both the receding and approaching components of a putative galactic
outflow around a distant galaxy. We measure a significant velocity shift between the
Mg ii absorption from the two sightlines (84 ± 17 km s−1 ), which is consistent with the
expectation from our simple fiducial wind model, possibly combined with an extended
disk contribution.

INTRODUCTION

Galaxies are surrounded by a complex multi-phase medium,
the circumgalactic medium (CGM; Tumlinson et al. 2017
for a recent review). Accretion from this CGM onto galaxies
and winds from the galaxies into the CGM are believed to
be key ingredients in regulating the evolution of galaxies.
The detailed study of absorption features detected in
bright background sources is one of the main observational tools helpful in characterizing the physical properties and kinematics of the CGM gas. Among various transitions, the Mg iiλλ2797, 2803 doublet is an especially useful tracer of the cool, photo-ionized component of the CGM
(T ≈ 104−5 K; e.g., Bergeron & Stasińska 1986). Its strength,

easy identifiability as a doublet, and convenient rest-frame
wavelength have allowed the collection of large statistical
samples of Mg ii absorbers (e.g. Lanzetta et al. 1987; Steidel
& Sargent 1992; Nestor et al. 2005; Zhu & Ménard 2013) at
redshifts 0.1 . z . 2.5. Follow-up observations of the fields
surrounding the absorbers have identified galaxies associated to the absorbers and, hence, clearly established that
the Mg ii absorbing gas is found in the haloes of galaxies
(e.g. Bergeron 1988; Bergeron & Boissé 1991; Steidel 1995;
Steidel et al. 2002; Nielsen et al. 2013a,b).
Subsequently, large observational efforts have been put
into mapping the spatial distribution and kinematics of the
Mg ii absorbing gas w.r.t. the galaxies in whose haloes the
gas resides. The major result from these studies is that the
Mg ii absorbing gas is not isotropically distributed around
the galaxies (e.g. Bordoloi et al. 2011; Bouché et al. 2012;

et al. 2019; Martin et al. 2019; Schroetter et al. 2019). Instead, the observations support a two-component geometry:
a bi-conical outflow perpendicular to the galaxy disk and
an extended gas disk approximately co-planar with the stellar disk. This allows to split the Mg ii absorber sightlines
into an outflow and a disk sub-sample, which can be used to
study the kinematics of the outflows (e.g. Bouché et al. 2012;
Kacprzak et al. 2014; Muzahid et al. 2015; Schroetter et al.
2015, 2016, 2019; Rahmani et al. 2018b; Martin et al. 2019)
and the extended gas accretion disks (e.g. Steidel et al. 2002;
Chen et al. 2005; Kacprzak et al. 2010, 2011b; Bouché et al.
2013, 2016; Ho et al. 2017; Ho & Martin 2019; Rahmani
et al. 2018a; Zabl et al. 2019), respectively.
The aforementioned results have been obtained statistically by collecting single sightlines around many galaxies.
A step forward would be to directly map the geometry of
the CGM around individual galaxies. Such “tomography” requires multiple or very extended bright background sources
behind the CGM of an individual galaxy.
Taking advantage of the comparably large extent that
galaxies in the local Universe span on the sky, Bowen et al.
(2016) have used four different background quasars to firmly
conclude for an individual galaxy that the absorbing gas is
distributed in an extended gas disk. However, having multiple sufficiently bright background galaxies covering the halo
of a single galaxy is rare, especially at high redshift where
the virial radius corresponds to a fraction of an arcminute.
The few studies beyond the local Universe were either
using quasars by chance aligned close to each other (e.g.
D’Odorico et al. 1998; Crighton et al. 2010; Muzahid 2014),
multiple imaged lensed-quasar pairs (e.g. Rauch et al. 1999;
Lopez et al. 1999, 2007; Ellison et al. 2004; Rubin et al.
2018), or extended galaxies (e.g. Péroux et al. 2018; Lopez
et al. 2018, 2019). The main focus of these studies was to
characterize the coherence scale of the absorbing gas.
In this paper, we present a tomographic study of the
CGM around a z = 0.70 galaxy surrounded by two bright
background sightlines which was discovered in the MUSE
Gas FLow and Wind (MEGAFLOW) survey (Schroetter
et al. 2016 -paper I-; Zabl et al. 2019 -paper II-; Schroetter et al. 2019 -paper III-). This survey consists of 79 strong
Mg ii absorbers towards 22 quasar sightlines which have been
selected to have (at least) three Mg ii absorbers with restframe equivalent widths EW0λ2796 > 0.3 Å and 0.4 < zabs <
1.5.
The paper is organized as follows. We present our observations in §2, the galaxies and absorption sightlines in
the field in §3, a model for the CGM in §4. We compare our
CGM model to our data and discuss our results in §5. Finally, we present our conclusions in §6. Throughout, we use
a 737 cosmology (H0 = 70 km s−1 , Ωm = 0.3, and ΩΛ = 0.7)
and we state all distances as ’proper’ (physical) distances.
A Chabrier (2003) stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF) is assumed. We refer to the [O ii] λλ3727, 3729 doublet simply as
[O ii]. All wavelengths and redshifts are in vacuum and are
corrected to a heliocentric velocity standard.

OBSERVATIONS
MUSE data

We observed the field around the quasar SDSSJ1358+1145
with MUSE (Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer; Bacon et al.
2006, 2010) for a total integration time of 3.11 hr. The first
four exposures (4x1500 s=1.67 hr; 2016-04-09), which constitute the data used in papers II&III, were taken with
the nominal wide field mode without adaptive optics (AO)
(WFM-NOAO-N), as MUSE’s AO system was not yet available at the time. After identifying the science case of the
present work, we realized a potential benefit from using
MUSE’s extended mode for subsequent observations of the
field. Therefore, we completed the observations in extended
wide field mode, while additonally taking advantange of the
available AO (4x1300 s=1.44 hr; 2018-03-14; WFM-AO-E).
Extended mode increases the blue wavelength coverage from
4750 Å to 4600 Å with the trade-off of some second order
contamination at wavelengths & 8000 Å. The extra coverage
helps to better constrain the continuum around Mg ii λ2796
at z = 0.704, the redshift of the foreground galaxy whose
CGM we study in this work.
We reduced the data identically to paper II, except that
we were using DRSv2.4 (Weilbacher et al. 2012, 2014, 2016),
which allows for the reduction of the AO data. The combined
AO and non-AO data have a point source Moffat full width
at half maximum (FWHM) of 000 .55 at 7050 Å. Using the
depth estimator from paper II, this exposure time (3.11 hr)
and this seeing results in an [O ii] point source detection
limit of 2.7 × 10−18 erg s−1 cm−2 . 1
2.2

UVES data

We observed the quasar SDSSJ1358+1145 with the VLT
high-resolution spectrograph UVES (Ultraviolet and Visual
Echelle Spectrograph; Dekker et al. 2000) for a total integration time of 2966 s in the night of 2016-04-07. Further details
about observation, reduction, and continuum normalisation
are given in paper II.

RESULT
Identification of background sightlines

The main galaxy at z = 0.704 (main) was discovered
through association with an EW0λ2796 = 2.5 Å Mg ii absorber
towards the quasar SDSSJ1358+1145 from MEGAFLOW at
an impact parameter of b = 200 .3 (16.8 kpc).
This quasar sightline is particularly interesting as it contains two additional very strong Mg ii absorbers with a restframe equivalent width EW0λ2796 = 1.8 and 2.6 Å at redshifts
zabs = 0.81 and 1.42, respectively. The galaxy counterparts
of the zabs = 0.81 and zabs = 1.42 absorbers have been described in paper III (wind sample) and paper II (accretion
sample), respectively. They are galaxies with log(M∗ /M )
of 9.3 and 9.9, and are at relatively small impact parameters of 100 .6 and 300 .6 from the quasar, as also expected from
the known Mg ii EW–impact parameter anti-correlation (e.g.
1

The estimate is for ≈ 7000 Å. The detection limits are higher
at shorter and longer wavelengths (see e.g. Bacon et al. 2017).

Lanzetta & Bowen 1990; Bouché et al. 2006; Kacprzak et al.
2011a; Chen et al. 2010; Nielsen et al. 2013b). We refer to
these galaxies in the following as back2 and back1 , respectively.
Thus, together with the quasar, the main (z = 0.704)
galaxy has potentially three background sightlines (quasar,
back1 , and back2 ) that can probe the CGM kinematics. In
addition to the quasar, back1 is a useful background source,
as it has a very bright UV continuum.2 back2 is not a useful
background source, due to intractable contamination from
the close-by quasar. The orientation of all three sightlines
w.r.t. the z = 0.704 galaxy is shown in Fig. 1(A) and listed
in Table 1. The listed uncertainties are resulting from the uncertainties on position angle and centroid of the main galaxy
(cf. §3.2 and Appendix A).

3.2

The main galaxy’s properties

The spectrum of the main z = 0.704 galaxy is shown in Fig.
2. The galaxy shows visibly weaker line emission than is
typical for star-forming galaxies on the star forming “main
sequence” (MS) at this redshift (e.g. Speagle et al. 2014;
Boogaard et al. 2018). Quantitatively, we found the galaxy
to have a stellar mass of log(M∗ /M ) =9.8+0.4
−0.0 and a star
−1
formation rate (SFR) of 0.5+0.3
.
−0.2 M yr
The corresponding specific SFR (sSFR = 0.07 ±
0.06 Gyr−1 ) is −0.6+0.2
−0.6 dex (or ≈ 1.5σ) below the MS prediction for z = 0.70 (Boogaard et al. 2018). This means our
galaxy is similar to ’green valley’ galaxies.
We determined the stellar mass and SFR as in paper II.
In short, we estimated M∗ from SED fitting using our custom code coniecto (see also Zabl et al. 2016) on 13 pseudomedium band filters created from the MUSE spectrum.3
Other values obtained from the SED fit are listed in Table 2.
The (instantaneous) SFR was determined starting from the
measured [O ii] flux, correcting it for extinction using the
Calzetti et al. (2000) law with the strength of the extinction estimated from the M∗ − E(B − V ) relation of Garn &
Best (2010), and converted to a SFR using the Kewley et al.
(2004) relation.
We estimated the [O ii] flux from a fit to the [O ii]
morpho-kinematics using the 3D fitting tool galpak3d
(Bouché et al. 2015). This fit provided us also with a best-fit
estimate of the kinematics (see Table 2). The steps involved
in the galpak3d fitting were again identical to those described in paper II. However, as the [O ii] flux is low for this
galaxy, it was not possible to robustly measure the kinematics and morphology (inclination in particular) based on [O ii]
alone.4 Thus, we decided to constrain the inclination, i, using
a continuum map in a pseudo r-band image created from the

2

The full spectral energy distribution (SED) of the z=1.42 back1
galaxy is shown in the Supplementary Appendix of paper II. The
galaxy has a M2800 Å absolute total magnitude of -20.8, which is
slightly brighter than the characteristic Schechter magnitude at
its redshift (Dahlen et al. 2007).
3 Different from paper II, we assumed a delayed τ star formation
history (SFH) (SFR ∝ t × exp(−t/τ ), with t being the elapsed
cosmic time since the galaxy started forming stars.
4 This is the reason why the galaxy was not part of the sample
in paper III.

MUSE cube. We determined the galaxy morphology, including i and position angle, P A, from this continuum map using
galfit (Peng et al. 2010). Further, we used the appropriate
PSF for the r-band as determined from the quasar. The fit
was complicated by systematic residuals from the close-by
quasar. Nevertheless, we could obtain a robust estimate of
i = 71 ± 5 deg and P A = 37 ± 8 deg. Details about the fit
and the method to estimate the uncertainties are given in
Appendix A. Finally, we fit the [O ii] kinematics with galpak3d using i and the P A as obtained from the continuum
(i = 71 deg, P A = 37 deg).

3.3

Absorption in CGM of the main galaxy

The CGM around the z = 0.704 main galaxy can be probed
in absorption at multiple locations using the spectra of the
background quasar and the back1 galaxy. While high spectral resolution spectroscopy is only available for the quasar,
we can use the MUSE data cube to probe Mg ii absorption
with the same spectral resolution in both sightlines.

3.3.1

Mg ii absorption at the resolution of MUSE

Mg ii is the strongest among the CGM metal absorption
lines covered by the MUSE data at this redshift and hence
the most useful to probe the CGM with low signal-tonoise (S/N) background galaxy sightlines. We show in panel
E of Fig. 1 the observed z=0.704 Mg ii absorption both
for the quasar (orange) and the back1 (red) sightlines
(Mg ii λ2796 -dotted-, Mg ii λ2803 -solid-). The figure shows
that Mg ii absorption is not only visible in the quasar sightline (EW0λ2796 = 2.7 Å), as per selection, but also in the
back1 sightline (EW0λ2796 = 2.0 Å).
Despite the moderate spectral resolution (190 km s−1
at 4700 Å), the absorption profiles encode interesting information. First, a velocity shift is clearly visible between the
two sightlines. The absorption in the back1 galaxy sightline is redshifted w.r.t. that in the quasar sightline by
84 ± 17 km s−1 , with the absorption in the two sightlines
centred at 110 ± 17 km s−1 and 25.8 ± 0.4 km s−1 , respectively. We obtained these velocity measurements by simultaneously fitting both components of the Mg ii doublet with
Gaussians. Second, we measured a EW0λ2796 /EW0λ2803 ratio
close to one in both sightlines. This means the Mg ii absorption is strongly saturated.5 Third, we find that the flux
reaches almost zero at peak absorption. For both sightlines,
this means, when accounting for the resolution of MUSE,
that the Mg ii absorption is spread over a large velocity
range. For the extended galaxy sightline (back1 ), this further means that the Mg ii coverage must be complete over
the extent of the aperture from which we have extracted the
background spectrum. The non-circular extraction aperture,
which was chosen to optimize the S/N, included 29 spatial
pixels corresponding to an area of 1.2 arcsec2 .

The EW0λ2796 /EW0λ2803 ratio for optically thin absorption is
2:1.

Absorption at the resolution of UVES

In the previous section, we compared Mg ii absorption along
both the galaxy and the quasar sightline at the same moderate spectral resolution of MUSE. For the quasar sightline, we can use the high spectral resolution UVES spectrum
(8 km s−1 ) to study the kinematics in more detail. In Fig. 3,
we show one line each for Mn ii, Zn ii, Fe ii, Mg ii, Mg i, Na i.
This is a subset of the low ionization lines covered by the
UVES spectrum. In addition to the data, a multi-component
fit is shown. For this fit, the positions and total number of
velocity components in the absorption system were derived
from all identified species. Their wavelength positions were
then fixed to avoid degeneracy with blended features. For individual elements, only a subset of components was selected
and fitted with a single Gaussian each with the evolutionary
algorithm described in Quast et al. (2005) and applied in
Wendt & Molaro (2012).
As expected from the MUSE spectrum, the Mg ii λ2796
absorption covers a broad velocity range - from −130 to
205 km s−1 - and is strongly saturated for most of this
range. Unsaturated or weakly saturated lines, such as the
Mg i λ2852 line, are more useful to identify sub-structures.
Based on these transitions, we identified three main components, which are indicated in Fig. 3 and labeled with A
(red), B (magenta), and C (orange). They are offset from
the systemic redshift of the foreground galaxy by −49, 10,
and 100 km s−1 , respectively.
From the UVES spectrum, [Zn ii/Fe ii] is measured for
components A+B to be ∼ 1.1±0.1,6 which indicates a significant amount of depletion for intervening systems (De Cia
et al. 2016) of ≈ 0.3 dex (≈ 1.5 dex) for Zn (Fe), respectively. This level of depletion is also associated with more
metal rich absorption systems with [Zn/H] around 1/2 solar
(De Cia et al. 2016).

CGM TOY MODEL

Mg ii absorption around a galaxy is in observations predominantly found either along the galaxy’s minor or major axis
(e.g. Bordoloi et al. 2011; Bouché et al. 2012; Kacprzak et al.
2012; Nielsen et al. 2015; Martin et al. 2019), see also paper II
and paper III. A natural explanation for this dichotomy is
a simple model of a bi-conical outflow perpendicular to the

galaxy disk. This picture has gained support both from the
theoretical and observational sides, i.e. predictions from cosmological hydro simulations (winds e.g., Dubois & Teyssier
2008; Shen et al. 2012, 2013, disks: e.g., Pichon et al. 2011;

for a review, disks: e.g., Putman et al. 2009; Wang et al.
2016; Ianjamasimanana et al. 2018).
In the following, we investigate a toy model implementation for kinematics and morphology of a disk+outflow model
to interpret the observed absorption features in both the
quasar and back1 sightlines.

Model parameters
Biconical outflow

For the outflow model, we assume that a galaxy launches
winds from its central region into a bi-conical outflow with
half-opening angle θout . We allow the cone to be devoid of
Mg ii within an inner opening angle, θin , as indicated by
larger samples of wind pairs (e.g. papers I & III, Bouché
et al. (2012)). For the wind kinematics, we assume that the
gas flows outward radially with an outflow velocity, vout ,
that does not change with distance from the galaxy. From

corresponds to the systemic redshift of the main galaxy (z = 0.70344) as measured from the [O ii] emission.

mass conservation, this constant velocity necessitates a radial density ρ(r) ∝ r−2 , which is normalized at 1 kpc with
ρ1 ≡ ρ(1kpc). We also account for random motions of the
encountered gas with σgas . Moreover, we assume that the gas
does not change its ionization state and that it is smoothly
distributed. Thus the wind parameters are θout , θin , vout and
ρ1 and σgas which are listed Table 3.

The cone opening angle θout is ≈ 30 deg, and the inner cone is θin ≈ 15 deg, consistent with typical values
in paper III. The outflow velocity vout is assumed to be
150 km s−1 , corresponding to the typical vout in paper III.
The intrinsic dispersion σgas is chosen somewhat arbitrarily
to be 10 km s−1 . All parameters of the fiducial model are
summarized in Table 4.

4.1.2

Extended gas disk

However, as the sightlines are at relatively small impact parameters (at 8.8 kpc and 16.8 kpc), a contribution from a
thick extended gas disk cannot be ruled out. We model this
extended gaseous disk as an exponential profile with scale
length hr in radial direction. In the direction perpendicular
to the disk (z-direction), we assume an exponentional profile with scale height hz . The gas density is normalized at
the disk mid-plane in the disk center with ρ0 . For the disk’s
kinematics, we assume that the gas is rotating parallel to
the disk midplane with a circular velocity vcirc , which we
assume to be identical to vmax from the galaxy rotation. In
addition, the gas velocity vector can also have a radial infall
component, vr , which is added to the tangential component

to be ∼ 10 km s−1 appropriate for the temperature of lowionization gas. The density ρ0 will be adjusted in order to

Simulated absorption lines

We use our code cgmpy to calculate the Mg ii absorption
profile which the outflow cones and/or the extended gas
disk would imprint on a background source. In short, the
code calculates for each of small steps (= 1 pc) along the
line-of-sight (LOS) the LOS velocity, vlos;step , and the column density, Nstep , which can subsequently be converted
to an optical depth, τstep (vlos ). The full τ (vlos ) distribution
for the complete sightline is then obtained by summing up
the τstep (vlos ) from each step and each component without
the turbulent velocity dispersion σgas . We account for this
random motions of the gas (σgas ) by convolving the optical
depth distribution with a Gaussian of the selected σgas . Finally, the absorption profile is obtained by taking e−τ (vlos )
and convolving with the instrumental line spread function
(LSF).
In the case of an extended sightline (such as for ‘back1 ’),
the absorption from the extended object is calculated by
taking the average over individual sightlines flux weighted
over an elliptical aperture centered on the galaxy (for back1
with an area of ∼ 1 arcsec2 ).

not expect this simple toy model to account for all data features nor do we attempt to formally fit it to the data. Thus,
if the model can, at least approximately, explain most of
the absorption in both background sightlines, the simple toy
model can be viewed as a description of the main galaxy’s
CGM.

5.1

The fiducial (wind-only) model

We first tested the performance of a fiducial biconical
outflow-only model (cf. §4.1.1) given that both the quasar
and back1 are positionned along the minor axis of the host
galaxy, i.e. without an extended gas disk.
Here, the model’s orientation is set by the measurement
of the galaxy’s inclination i (see §3.2). However, as the sign of
the galaxy inclination cannot be constrained with the available data (see e.g. Ho & Martin 2019), we were left with two
possible solutions. Here, we choose the sign of the inclination such that the absorbing gas in the cones is outflowing.
This outflow assumption requires that redshifted absorption
must originate from the far-side cone, and consequently, the
back1 galaxy sightline crosses this far-side cone. Panels B
and C of Fig. 1 show the adopted orientation.
For our ‘fiducial’ outflow model, we assume a value for
θout (35 deg), which is at the higher end of typical values
found in paper III. We made this choice, to ensure very high
coverage over the extended back1 galaxy sightline in the
model, as required by the observed absorption strength (see
§3.3.1).
In Fig. 4 (row 1 - ‘Fiducial wind’), we overlay the resulting absorption profiles over the UVES and MUSE data
for the ‘qso’ (Cols 1, 2 and 3) and ‘back1 ’ (Col. 4) sightlines.
Column 1 (2) show the model for the quasar sightlines for
Mg ii (Mg i), respectively, where we scaled the Mg i density
by 1/600 compared to Mg ii according to Lan & Fukugita
(2017). Comparing our UVES data to the model for the
quasar sightlines shown in Cols. 1 ans 2, we find that the
absorption is made of two separate components which arise
from the assumption of an empty inner cone. These two
components might correspond to components A and B in
the observed spectrum (see §3.3.2). Comparing our MUSE
data and the fiducial wind model (Cols 3 and 4), we find
that the model and data match qualitatively for the blue(red-) shifted absorptions in the quasar (galaxy) sightlines
absorption shown in Col. 3 (4), respectively. However, there
are some discrepancies between the model and the data.
The main discrepancy is that the wind model cannot
explain the redshifted third component C. Another discrepancy is that, for the quasar absorption, the model predicts
MNRAS 000, 1–13 (2015)

a blue-shift (−75 km s−1 ) whereas the observed absorption
is close to systemic at ≈ +25 km s−1 .
A model with lower outflow velocity (vout ≈ 75 km s−1 )
would better match to components A and B in the Mg i absorption (Fig. 4; row 2 - ‘Slow wind’). However, it underpredicts the redshift compared to the Mg ii data in the
back1 galaxy sightline. Note that this potential velocity difference between the two sightlines could indicate deceleration of the gas with distance from the galaxy, as the quasar
sightline is probing gas at a larger impact parameter than
the back1 sightline does (16.8 kpc vs 8.8 kpc). Strong, nongravitational, deceleration in an outflow could be due to drag
forces (in observations e.g., Martini et al. 2018; in simulations e.g., Oppenheimer et al. 2010). However, this interpretation would require the strong assumption that the two
opposite cones have the same velocity profile.

5.2

Disk model

Given the limitations of the fiducial wind only-model, and
the relatively small impact parameters, we discuss the extended gaseous disk model presented in §4.1.2. Indeed, the
two minor-axis sightlines cross the disk midplane at galactocentric radii of 26 kpc (0.21 rvir ) and 51 kpc (0.42 rvir ),
within the extent of co-rotating gas disks from paper II and
Ho et al. (2017). Before discussing a potential combination
of wind and disk-model, we test whether a simple thick disk
model similar to Steidel et al. (2002); Kacprzak et al. (2010);
Ho et al. (2017) can potentially explain all absorption on its
own.
In Fig. 4 (row 3 - ‘Disk’), we overlay the resulting absorption profiles over the MUSE and UVES data as before.
Comparing the UVES data to our model shows that a thick
disk model can only explain component B in the Mg i spectrum.8 As for the wind model, the thick disk model cannot
explain the redshifted third component C. However, component A in the UVES spectrum could be accounted for with
an extension of this disk model with a radial inflow component (shown in row 4 of Fig. 4 - ‘Disk + infall’). The observed velocity of −49 km s−1 would require a radial velocity
component of vr ≈ −40 km s−1 = −0.4 vvir .9 Such a radial

8

We note that a very thin disk would have a narrower profile,
hence a lower equivalent width, and also a lower velocity shift
than a thick disk. This is, because a sightline crossing a thick
disks encounters different velocities at different heights above the
disk, up to sin(i)vcirc (e.g. Steidel et al. 2002).
9 v ≈ −40 km s−1 is enough to match the observed blueshift of
r
component A, because the model has also a contribution from the
rotational component (vcirc ).

Combined disk and wind

The observed absorption might be a combination of aborption from both a disk and an outflow component. As discussed in §5.1, the ouflow component alone, a faster wind
(150 km s−1 ) matches better the observed absorption in the
back1 sightline, while a slower wind (75 km s−1 ) matches
better the absorption in the qso sightline. For the following, we assume a wind speed of 100 km s−1 as a compromise
to match approximately both sightlines with a single wind
speed. Fig. 4 (row 5 - ‘Disk + wind’) shows the resulting
absorption profile when combining the disk and this wind
toy model (The same model is also shown in Fig. 1, panel
D). While imperfect, the toy model is qualitatively in agreement with the observed spectra, apart from component C.
Component C might be an unrelated component, similar to
the high-velocity clouds (HVC) seen around the Milky Way
(e.g., Wakker & van Woerden 1997 for a review). In summary, a plausible interpretation of the observed kinematics
in the two sightlines is absorption in a bi-conical outflow
with a potential disk contribution.

inflow velocity is feasible, based on results from simulations
(e.g. Rosdahl & Blaizot 2012; van de Voort & Schaye 2012;
Goerdt & Ceverino 2015; Ho et al. 2019) and observational
studies targeting the major axis sightlines (e.g. Bouché et al.
2013, 2016; Rahmani et al. 2018a, paper II).

Feasibility of the outflow

As discussed in §3.2, the SFR of the main galaxy is low
compared to star-forming galaxies with similar mass at similar redshift. This raises the question whether the energy
and the momentum that are required to explain the wind
are at all feasible. To answer this question, we estimated
the mass outflow rate, Ṁout , the energy-outflow rate, Ėout ,
and the momentum outflow rate, ṗout . These estimates can
subsequently be compared to the estimated SFR and the
corresponding energy and momentum deposition rates from
supernovae (SNe).
We estimated Ṁout for the bi-conical outflow of cool
gas using Eq. 5 from paper III. As inputs to the equation we assumed θout = 35 deg, θin = 15 deg, b = 15 kpc,
vout = 100 km s−1 , log(NH i /cm−2 ) = 20.0. Here, we estimated the H i column density using the EW0λ2796 - H i relation from Ménard & Chelouche (2009) and Lan & Fukugita
(2017), which has an uncertainty of around 0.3 dex. Using
these values in the equations we obtain Ṁout = 2.0 M yr−1 .
This corresponds with the assumed vout = 100 km s−1 to
Ėout = 6.0 × 1039 erg s−1 and ṗout = 1.3 × 1033 g cm s−1 .
A comparison of Ṁout to the estimated SFR allows us to
infer the mass-loading (η = Ṁout /SFR), which characterizes
the efficiency of a star formation powered wind to remove gas
from the galaxy. Assuming that the wind was powered by
the current SFR of 0.5 M yr−1 , we infer η ≈ 4. This value
can be compared to measurements of η both from individual estimates (quasar sightlines e.g. paper III, Bouché et al.
2012; Schroetter et al. 2015; down the barrel: e.g. Weiner
et al. 2009; Martin et al. 2012; Rubin et al. 2014; Sugahara
et al. 2017), indirect observational evidence (e.g. Zahid et al.
2014; Mitra et al. 2015), or simulations (e.g. Hopkins et al.
2012; Muratov et al. 2015). For the mass and redshift of our
main galaxy, the values in these studies typically range from
η ≈ 1–10 (see also discussion in paper III). Hence, we conclude that the η corresponding to our preferred model seems
feasible.
A direct comparison of the measured Ėout and ṗout to
the momentum and energy injected by SNe leads to a similar

conclusion. Per 1M yr−1 of star formation SNe deposit mechanical energy and momentum with rates of approximately
1.6 × 3 × 1041 erg s−1 (from Chisholm et al. 2017 based on
Leitherer et al. 1999) and 1.6 × 2 × 1033 g cm s−1 (Murray
et al. 2005).10 This means that our measured values correspond to energy and momentum loading of 3% and 80%,
respectively. These values are comparable to those found by
Chisholm et al. (2017) for a sample of local star-forming
galaxies when considering the relevant mass range.11
Finally, we note that the actual loading factors could
be smaller. The SFR might have been higher at the time
when the wind was launched. It would have taken the wind
≈ 200 Myr (≈ 100 Myr) to travel to the quasar (back1 ) sightline, assuming vout = 100 km s−1 . With the limited available
data we cannot rule out that there was a significant burst
of star-formation about 200–300 Myr ago, as motivated by

CONCLUSIONS

It is now statistically well established that there is a dichotomy in the spatial distribution of the cool circumgalactic medium (CGM) gas probed through Mg ii absorption, where the two components have been identified as arising in an extended gas disk and a bi-conical outflow. In this
paper, we present a rare chance alignment of a quasar and
a UV-bright background galaxy at relatively small impact
parameters (16.8 and 8.8 kpc) from a z = 0.7 foreground
galaxy. As the two sightlines are close to the foreground
galaxy’s projected minor axis, but on opposite sides of the
major axis, the configuration is ideal to test the bi-conical
outflow component. Through studying the observed absorption both in MUSE and UVES data from the MEGAFLOW
survey, and comparison to modeled absorption, we reached
the following conclusions:

10

J. Zabl et al.

• Both sightlines show very strong Mg ii absorption
(EW0λ2796 > 2.0 Å).
• We find a significant velocity shift of 84 ± 17 km s−1
between the two sightlines.
• The observed velocity shift is in broad agreement with a
bi-conical outflow toy model with a moderate outflow velocity of ≈ 100 km s−1 , possibly combined with a disk model.
• The foreground galaxy has a relatively low sSFR (0.07±
0.06 Gyr−1 ), which puts the galaxy 0.6 dex below the MS at
z = 0.7. However, the mass-loading (η) required to explain
the modelled outflow is not unrealistic high (η ≈ 4). Moreover, the sSFR may have been higher when the wind was
launched, ∼ 108 yr.
This study presented a ‘tomographic’ study (i.e. with
multi-sightline) of the CGM around an individual galaxy in
the distant Universe (z ≈ 0.7), and hence goes beyond the
statistical inference from single sightline samples. While we
find the data to be in broad agreement with our fiducial
CGM model, we cannot rule out alternative explanations.
A comparison of the CGM model to larger samples of rare
multi-sightline cases, including cases with even more sightlines as e.g. provided by background groups or gravitationally lensed arcs (e.g. Lopez et al. 2018, 2019), will be an
important test for our assumed geometry. Additionally, it
will be necessary to test the geometry against observations
of the CGM in emission (e.g. Finley et al. 2017; Rupke et al.
2019).

APPENDIX A: UNCERTAINTY ON
INCLINATION AND POSITION ANGLE
In our analysis, we tied the orientation of our toy model (§4)
to the orientation of the main foreground galaxy. Therefore,
a robust measurement of position angle (P A) and inclination
(i) is important. As discussed in §3.2, the measurement of
the galaxy’s morphology is somewhat complicated by residuals from the PSF subtraction. The residuals made a formal
assessment of the uncertainties based on the χ2 doubtful.
Therefore, we preferred to rely on a visual assessment of the
uncertainties. For this purpose we created galfit models
deviating from the best fit model either in P A or inclination. Fig. A1 shows models and residuals all for the best-fit
model, the P Abest − 15 deg, P Abest + 15 deg, ibest − 10 deg ,
ibest + 10 deg . Except for the modified P A or i, we used in
each case identical morphological parameters to those in the
best fit model. The only free fit parameter in each of the
alternative models was the total flux. Both for P A ± 15 deg

Figure A1. Data, galfit model, and residuals (data-model) are shown for each of five models in the top, center, and bottom row,
respectively. The data, which are identical in each of the four columns, are a pseudo broadband r image created from the MUSE cube.
The main foreground galaxy is to the left and the back1 background galaxy is to the right (north is to the top, east to the left; different
orientation from Fig. 1). The white region to the lower left masks residuals from the quasar subtraction. Left column: Best fit galfit
model, where both main and back1 were fit simultaneously. The main galaxy has best fit P Abest = 37 deg and ibest = 71 deg assuming
a n = 1 Sersic profile. Center left column: This column and the other three columns show the best fit model with either the P A
or i of the main galaxy adjusted. Here, P A = P Abest − 15 deg; Center column: P A = P Abest + 15 deg; Center right column:
i = ibest − 10 deg; Right column: i = ibest + 10 deg.

and i ± 10 deg the residuals are much stronger than for the
best-fit model and the models seems essentially inconsistent
with the data. Therefore, it seems plausible to define these
P A and incl differences as 2σ uncertainties. In summary, we
conclude therefore that the 1σ uncertainties for P A and i
are 8 deg and 5 deg, respectively.
In addition to the uncertainty in P A and i, there is also
a small uncertainty on the centroid. We estimated this uncertainty through comparison between the continuum centroid obtained from this galfit fit and the [O ii] centroid
obtained from galpak3d fit. We find a deviation of 000 .16
between the two centroids. Therefore, we can assume as 1σ
uncertainty 000 .1 both in right ascension and declination.

APPENDIX B: IMPACT OF UNCERTAINTIES
ON INCLINATION AND POSITION ANGLE ON
MODELS
In this section, we asses the impact of the uncertainties for
i and P A on the simulated absorption in our toy models.
In Fig. B1 we show the ‘Slow wind’ model (see. Table 4)
with either i or P A changed compared to the fiducial values
(row 1). Rows 2 and 3 show the result for changing the i by
±5 deg (i.e., 66 deg and 76 deg), while keeping the fiducial
value for the P A. Rows 4 and 5 show the impact of varying
the P A of main by ±10 deg. Assuming ∆P A ± 10 deg means

that the azimuthal angle α is changed by ∓10 deg both for
the quasar and the back1 sightline (equally) compared to
the values stated in Table 1. All other parameters are kept
identical to those listed for the ‘Slow wind’ model in Table 4
and shown in the first row of Fig. B1.
In general, the differences between the absorption profiles for these variants appear small. The strongest visible
impact is for ∆P A = +10 deg (corresponding to α = 71 deg
for quasar and α = −119 deg for back1 ). In this case, the
Mg i absorption profile is not double-peaked and the Mg ii
absorption in the back1 sightline is visibly weaker than in
the fiducial model. The double peak is absent, because the
distance from the minor axis is larger than in the fiducial
case and, consequently, the quasar sightline does not cross
the hollow part of the cone. The weaker Mg ii absorption
for back1 is also a consequence of a larger distance from
the minor axis. At α = −119 deg part of the extended back1
galaxy sightline is no longer covered by the cone at all, which
reduces the effective EW0λ2796 .
In Fig B2, we test the impact of the same i and P A
variations, but now for the ‘Disk’ model (see Table 4). Here,
the differences in absorption strength appear stronger than
in the wind case. This is especially the case for changes in
i. Here, the strength varies - especially for the Mg i absorption in the quasar sightline - as the sightline crosses the disk
mid-plane at larger galacto-centric radii, the larger the i is.
We note, though, that most of the changes could be comMNRAS 000, 1–13 (2015)

values stated in the row labels. For further details, see Appendix B.

pensated for by merely choosing a disk with higher density.
For the variations with P A, the centroid of the absorption
shifts, but only slightly.
In summary, we can conclude that the uncertainties on i
and P A/α, as estimated in Appendix A, only subtly change
our simulated profiles. Therefore, we can conclude that our
conclusions in §5 are not impacted by these uncertainties.
