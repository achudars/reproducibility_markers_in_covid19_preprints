Abstract
Nonlinear-optical refraction is typically described by means of perturbation theory near the
material’s equilibrium state. Graphene, however, can easily move far away from its equilibrium
state upon optical pumping, yielding strong nonlinear responses that cannot be modeled as mere
perturbations. So far, one is still lacking the required theoretical expressions to make predictions
for these complex nonlinear effects and to account for their evolution in time and space. Here, this
long-standing issue is solved by the derivation of population-recipe-based expressions for graphene’s
nonperturbative nonlinearities. The presented framework successfully predicts and explains the
various nonlinearity magnitudes and signs observed for graphene over the past decade, while also
being compatible with the nonlinear pulse propagation formalism commonly used for waveguides.

INTRODUCTION

Over the past decade there has been a rapidly growing interest in the theoretical [1, 2] and
experimental [3–13] investigation of nonlinear-optical refraction in graphene using free-space
and waveguided excitation configurations. This new research field was pioneered by the experiments of Hendry et al. showing an exceptionally large effective graphene nonlinearity
(3)

|χgr | ∼ 10−7 esu [3] or, equivalently, an effective nonlinear index |n2,gr | ∼ 10−13 m2 W−1 .
The research results reported since then seem to point in different directions, and have
made it a major challenge to fully understand graphene’s nonlinear-optical behavior. The
experimental data include both positive- [4, 9] and negative-valued [6–8, 12] effective nonlinearities with a magnitude compatible with that of Hendry’s experiments [3], as well as much
smaller nonlinearities [10]. From the theory point-of-view, calculations for the perturbative
(3)

nonlinearity χgr [1, 2] give rise to nonlinearities that are two orders of magnitude smaller
(3)

than |χgr | ∼ 10−7 esu measured in the aforementioned experiments. Strictly speaking, using
perturbation theory implies that the graphene remains close to its initial equilibrium state,
but this is not necessarily the case [14].
Most of the experiments carried out so far were conducted using an exfoliated or chemicalvapor-deposition (CVD)-grown graphene sample without intentional doping. As such, when
using optical excitation wavelengths, one-photon absorption (1PA) in the graphene layer is
unavoidable, and the resulting free-carrier generation can give rise to nonlinearities outside
the perturbative regime with strong changes not only in temperature [11, 15] but also in
chemical potential [13]. These changes will be time- and space-dependent when dealing with
propagating excitation pulses. What is more, our recent investigations on the evolution of
the spectral bandwidth of pulses propagating in graphene-covered waveguides [12] have
shown the need for a nonperturbative treatment of graphene’s nonlinear-optical refraction,
with saturation playing an important role in the carrier dynamics. For telecom excitation
wavelengths, we observed that this ’saturable photoexcited carrier refraction’ yields a strong,
negative nonlinearity from a phenomenological point of view, but we did not yet present a
mathematical description for the refraction efficiency as a function of graphene’s microscopic
properties [12].
Microscopic models used for calculating the ultrafast carrier dynamics and the resulting
nonlinear-optical response of graphene are generally built upon the equation of motion for
2

the density matrix [14]. Over the years, these models have been applied for describing the
nonlinear-optical physics in both large-area graphene and graphene nanoribbons [1, 2, 16–19].
Although many-particle interactions such as carrier-carrier and carrier-phonon scattering
can be rigorously included in this framework [16, 17], the complexity and computational
intensiveness of this modeling motivate simpler treatments of this microscopic physics based
on the relaxation-time approximation. Indeed, this approach was employed e.g. in [2], where
graphene’s perturbative optical nonlinearity was calculated solving the semiconductor Bloch
equations, and also in [18, 19], where nonperturbative phenomena in graphene were studied
by means of the generalized Bloch equations for massless Dirac fermions [20]. Whereas
the latter calculations are suitable for time-dependent excitations outside the perturbative
regime, another approach is needed, however, to deal with propagating optical pulses e.g.
in waveguides, in which case the nonlinear response for a given electric field is typically
described by means of a closed-form expression.
In this letter, we show that graphene’s nonlinear refraction efficiency for time- and spacedependent excitations outside the perturbative regime can be predicted using an easily
accessible formalism based on the so-called population recipe [14]. More specifically, the
refraction efficiency can be obtained from the excitation-induced instantaneous change in
both temperature and chemical potential, and from the resulting instantaneous change in the
linear conductivity of graphene, in line with the population recipe. We derive an expression
that links the conductivity change with the commonly used effective nonlinear index n2,gr
and with the free-carrier refraction (FCR) coefficient σFCR introduced in [12]. Finally, we
showcase the validity of our formalism for a wide variety of experiments in free space and
waveguides.

II.

RATE EQUATION AND POPULATION RECIPE

Semiconductor nonlinearities resulting from the optical excitation of free carriers can
often be described by means of the so-called population recipe, where the equilibrium carrier concentrations that enter into the linear conductivity are replaced by the photoexcited
carrier concentrations [14]. In this section we investigate whether this general ansatz for
semiconductors could also hold for graphene. Let us assume a single-mode electric field
√
propagating in the z-direction, E(x, y, z, t) = A(z, t)/( 4 N ) e(x, y, ω0 ) e−iω0 t eiβ(ω0 )z + c.c.,
3

where ω0 is the mean spectral frequency of the light beam, N is a normalization constant
such that |A(z, t)|2 equals the power, e denotes the transverse distribution of the electric
field, and β corresponds to the propagation constant. If a current density J is produced due
to the interaction between the electric field and a material such as graphene, exhibiting 1PA
characterized by its conductivity σij (ω0 ), then the electromagnetic energy converted into free
carriers per unit volume and unit time is given by ∂t w = J·E ≈ |A(z, t)|2 e∗i σij ej /(2N ), where
the last equation assumes a cycle averaging of the field [21]. In view of this equation, the dependence on space and time coordinates in w can be separated as w(x, y, z, t) = u(z, t)v(x, y).
Since u can show complex dependences on A as several carrier-related processes may exist,
effective models are often employed to deal with these phenomena [12, 22]. Along the same
lines, we will study the temporal dynamics of the photoexcited carrier concentration based
on the following rate equation for u:

∂t u = (1 −

u
u
)|A(z, t)|2 − ,
usat
τc

(1)

where usat and τc are phenomenological parameters that account for saturation and decay
mechanisms, respectively. The 1PA-induced carrier concentrations evolving in z and t can
then be computed by means of a spatial average (over (x, y)) of w/(h̄ω0 ), where h̄ is the
reduced Planck constant. In the Supporting Information (SI) we show that Equation (1)
can be derived from the generalized Bloch equations for massless Dirac fermions [20] on
> 100 fs) and that the light
condition that the optical pulse width T0 is sufficiently long (T0 ∼
intensity satisfies I0  (1.8 × 10−9 W m2 )/λ40 [18, 19] with λ0 = 2π c/ω0 and c the speed of
light in vacuum (e.g. I0  3 × 1014 W/m2 for λ0 = 1550 nm). The implications of these
conditions are further discussed in Section 4.
Now we explore how u behaves far from ∂t u = 0 solving Equation (1) by the integrating
factor method,

where |A(z, t)|2 = P0 U (z, τ = t/T0 ), with P0 being the input peak power. To facilitate
4

interpretation, a saturation time τsat = usat /P0 and a saturation power Psat = usat /τc have
been defined. The last step in Equation (2) assumes T0  τsat and T0 ∼ τc [12].
Important here is that Equation (2) can be recovered from the steady-state solution of
Equation (1) (∂t u = 0) if the time-independent steady-state power |A(z)|2 is replaced by
the instantaneous power |A(z, t)|2 . Hence the photoexcited carrier densities in graphene
could behave as carrier densities in ‘instantaneous’ steady states. As such, graphene’s
non-perturbative response could still be well described by means of the steady-state linear conductivity but with the carrier density at equilibrium replaced by the photoexcited
densities calculated along Equation (1). This carrier-induced instantaneous change in the
linear conductivity then translates into the nonlinear response of the material.

III.

NONLINEAR INDEX AND FCR COEFFICIENT

To implement the approach outlined above for modeling graphene’s nonlinear response for
propagating pulses in the non-perturbative regime, we need to find explicit functional dependences of the chemical potential µ and temperature T on the carrier concentration. To determine these, we consider that the probability of occupation of a state with energy E within the
time scale of the excitation pulse is given by instantaneous Fermi-Dirac distributions. The
density of states in graphene near the Dirac point is approximately ρgr = 2|E|/(π(h̄vF )2 ),
where vF ≈ 106 m s−1 is the Fermi velocity. The 2D densities of electrons n and holes p are
calculated as n(µ, T ) = 2/(π(h̄vF )2 ) µ2 J1 (ζ)/ζ 2 and p(µ, T ) = 2/(π(h̄vF )2 ) µ2 J1 (−ζ)/ζ 2 ,
where ζ = µ/(kB T ), J1 (ζ) is a Fermi-Dirac integral and kB is the Boltzmann constant [23].
We aim at deriving closed expressions for µ = µ(n) and T = T (n) taking into account the
electroneutrality condition, which relates n and p. To illustrate our approach we assume an
initial hole density p0 [7, 8, 12], so p = p0 + n.
To obtain explicit solutions µ = µ(n) and T = T (n), we use two fitting functions as
specified in the SI and after some algebra derive:

Here σ0 = e2 /4h̄ is the universal conductivity, with −e being the electron charge, and Γintra
and Γinter are scattering parameters for intraband and interband transitions, respectively.
This result accounts for the interband and intraband motion of electrons around the Dirac
cone at the single-particle level [1, 2]. Equation (5) with µ and T as defined in Equation
(3) and (4), incorporating the effect of photoexcited carriers n[A(z, t)], accounts for the

In contrast to the works reporting a nonlinear index for graphene, we already analyzed
our experiments with graphene-covered waveguides in [12] in terms of a nonlinear carrierrefraction response of the form −σFCR Nc embedded in the commonly used nonlinear pulse
propagation formalism. Here Nc is a 1D carrier density defined at each z-distance along the
waveguide. Using [22] as our starting point we derive an expression for our FCR coefficient:

duration, making it a robust measure for graphene’s nonlinear response.

COMPARISON WITH EXPERIMENTS IN LITERATURE

Most of the experiments to measure graphene’s nonlinearity at optical wavelengths have
been performed using exfoliated or CVD graphene without intentional doping. As such, for
most of those graphene samples the exact p0 value has not been measured. However, typical
ranges of unintentional doping values for exfoliated and CVD graphene can be found in [24]
and [25], respectively. Based on these works we will consider an average doping level of
p0 = 9 × 1012 cm−2 for exfoliated graphene and an average doping level of p0 = 4 × 1012 cm−2
for CVD graphene. To illustrate the behavior of n2,gr , Figures 1(a-d) show the calculated
(1)

Im(∆σyy /σ0 ) vs. Ñc = (vF /ω0 )n1/2 at two commonly used wavelengths λ0 = 0.8 µm and
λ0 = 1.55 µm and at the doping values for exfoliated and CVD graphene. Note that these
graphs are robust against changes in the scattering rates Γintra,inter . According to these
results and Equation (7), n2,gr is expected to switch sign between 0.8 µm and 1.55 µm with
positive (negative) values at the shorter (longer) wavelengths (see SI for a discussion in terms
of interband and intraband contributions). This prediction is in full agreement with the
experiments reported so far (see Table I) and shows the tunability of graphene’s nonlinearity
sign in the near-infrared. Our theory also puts forward the so far undetermined (negative)
sign of n2,gr in Hendry’s seminal experiments [3].
Besides predicting correct signs for n2,gr , Equation (7) also provides orders of magnitude
8

compatible with most nexp
2,gr values in Table I (including the highest values), within its oneorder-of-magnitude precision. This correspondence is remarkable as our calculations were
carried out with estimated parameter values nsat = 1017 m−2 and τc = 1 ps [12, 26] (see Table
I). Equation (7) also recovers the scaling of n2,gr with pulse duration in the sub-ps excitation
regime as experimentally observed in [8, 9]. Furthermore, as discussed in the SI, according
to our theory the nonlinear response is mainly introduced by the dynamical behavior of the
temperature rather than chemical potential and its switching in sign is mainly produced by
changes in the interband contribution.
When verifying again the conditions defining the validity area of our theory (namely
> 100 fs and I0  (1.8 × 10−9 W m2 )/λ4 ) we find that these conditions are essentially
T0 ∼
0
fulfilled for all works enlisted in Table I except for [5], where 15-fs-long pulses at high optical
intensities were used. The latter explains why our theory underestimates nexp
2,gr reported in [5]
by several orders of magnitude (see result marked with an asterisk in Table I). In experiments
with very short pulses such as in [5], the intraband carrier thermalization that follows right
after the interband excitation might still be ongoing at the end of the pulse duration. Under
such circumstances, the intraband contribution to the conductivity change might not be
important, in which case a much higher positive nonlinearity value could be produced by
theory (see SI). Further theoretical developments will be required to check this hypothesis.
This being said, the accessible theory presented here does yield a good match with all
other data in Table I observed for ps and sub-ps pulse lengths. This underlines the general
applicability of our model for a wide range of excitation conditions.
Finally, we want to emphasize that σFCR as specified in Equation (8) is a more robust
parameter than n2,gr to quantify graphene’s nonlinear response outside the perturbative
regime. For the σFCR value that we measured in graphene-covered waveguides [12], we find
an excellent agreement with our theoretical prediction (see bottom of Table I).
In conclusion, with our population-recipe-based theory we can adequately predict graphene’s
nonlinear refractive response for propagating pulses outside the perturbative regime. With
our expressions for n2,gr and σFCR , one can readily calculate how the nonlinear effects
evolve over time and distance. Our work explains the differences in sign and magnitude
of graphene’s nonlinear coefficients measured over the past decade, and also provides the
long-needed framework for conceptualizing, designing, and optimizing graphene-enhanced
nonlinear-optical (on-chip) devices.
