A NEW DEFINITION OF THE DIMENSION OF
GRAPHS

XINRUI ZHAO

ABSTRACT. Enlighted by the recent work of Hao Huang on sensitivity conjecture
[arXiv: 1907.00847], we propose a new definition of the dimension of graphs and
establish a relationship between the chromatic number and the dimension.

Dimension is a well-established and crucial notion in both geometry and algebra,
which reflects the degrees of freedom and plays an essential role in classifying objects.
It reveals, especially in geometry, the local picture of the subject. Since they are all in
the continuous setting, it is natural to ask what happens when moving to the discrete
case. In this paper, I would like to establish a new definition of the dimension of
graphs and understand how it plays with other properties of graphs.
As mentioned by Erd ̈ s, Harary and Tutte [1], there is a concept of dimension of
graphs defined according to the minimum dimension of Euclidean space such that the
graph can be put into keeping all edges of length 1 and vertices distinct. It reflects the
complexity of graphs in the sense of rigidity, which is more a global property instead
of telling what happens locally. Moreover, since the main concern is on the distance
between vertices and the intersections between edges are permitted, some graphs may
1

have extremely low dimension benefiting from the regularity of their structure. For
( ≥ 2) are all of dimensions 2 in that sense, which is kind of

example,

counterintuitive as they are certainly different locally.
Motivated by the resent work of Huang [2] on sensitivity conjecture, which
reveals that for any 2 + 1 points in

, there must be a point which has degree not

less than √ . It inspires me a new definition of dimension of graphs, which could
reflect the more local difference of graphs than the former one. On the other hand, I
will show that in some sense this dimension controls the former one from above.
Now let’s come to the definition part. Given a graph G = (V, E), where V stands
=( ,

for the vertices and E stands for the edges. Let
then we first define the sub-dimension of
( )=

∶

(
|

as

)⊂

,
|

|

) be a subgraph of G,

Or more concisely with the notation ∆(

( )

∈

|

) = max deg( ),
∈

subdim( ) =

(
|

min

|

,
|

)⊂

∆(

)

|

And finally, we define
( )=

∶
Here

(

,

)⊂

( )

is maximal means that it contains all the edges inside

belong to

whose vertices

.

The reason why we define in this way is the following. Since we want the
definition reflects the difference between

, it is very natural to introduce the

dimension of sub-dimension based on the work of Huang, which show that they are
2

√

for

.

The primary reason of taking the definition as the maximum among all
sub-dimension of the subgraphs is that we want the concept of dimension to reflect
the local behavior of the graph, which indicates that it should be at least
non-decreasing with respect to the inclusion relation. Another reason is that
sub-dimension is sometimes degenerate which is certainly not wanted, while the
dimension is always non-zero for graphs with edges from the monotonicity.
It is deserved to be pointed out that when calculating the sub-dimension, we take
subgraphs which have more than

+ 1 points. Here we take the floor function.

To make it more clearly, here I would like to give some simple examples.

EXAMPLE 1:
For a linear graph with n (n ≥ 4) points, the dimension is 1 as when we take
more than

+ 1 points from it, there must be two of them adjacent from the

drawer principle. On the other hand we can take 1, 2, 4, 5, … 3i+1, 3i+2… which
clearly realizes the lower bound 1. Since the sub-dimension are all 1, the dimension is
1 from the definition.

EXAMPLE 2:
For loops with n (n ≥ 5) points, similar as before, we can use the drawer
principle and the specific construction in example to conclude that they are all of
dimension one. It is reasonable because locally a loop looks exactly as linear graph
while the difference is shown only when we move to the global picture, which is not
supposed to be reflected by its dimension.

EXAMPLE 3:
For complete graph K , no matter taking any
maximal edge set, it would form a K
sub-dimension of K

is

, which has degree

. So the

. Since any subgraph with maximal edges of K

complete graph, we know that its sub-dimension is at most
K

+ 1 points from it with

.

EXAMPLE 4:
For complete bipartite graph

,

(m ≤ n), if n ≠ m, then its sub-dimension

is 0 since we can take the points in the side corresponding to n. If n = m, then the
best strategy is to take

+1 and m −

+1. Since any sub-graph of

,

m, b ≤ n, a ≤ b). So the dimension of

respectively and the sub-dimension is

with maximal edge set is of the form
,

(m ≤ n) is

,

(a ≤

+1.

After considering these examples, it might be natural to come back to our
motivation, that is, the Q . Huang’s work [2] is equal to say that the sub-dimension
of Q

is √ . As we have defined the dimension as the maximum of sub-dimension

of sub-graphs with maximal edge set, it is not clear at this point whether Q ’s
dimension is √

as a sub-graph of it might be weird. It is natural, however, to

guess that the dimension of Q

is also √ , while it is indeed the case using the

symmetric structure of Q .

Theorem 1:
dim(
Proof:

)= √

From Huang’s work [2], we know that the sub-dimension of Q

is at least

√ . To verify that the lower bounded is achieved, we would need to introduce a
construction given by Chung [3].
Lemma 1

such that the degree of

Using this lemma, we are now ready to prove that the dimension of Q

with maximal edge set has

sub-dimension less or equal to √ . Take a sub-graph G = (V , E ) ⊂ Q
maximal edge set E , which means that it contains all the edges of Q

with

between

vertices in V . It now suffices to prove that the sub-dimension of G is equal or less
than √ . Here we use the symmetry of

such sets while each has

+ 1 points.
Consider the intersection of them with G , the sub-graph we fixed before. Here

we will use the probability type argument. Since each

sub-dimension of G is not more than √ . Combined with the construction of G ,
we concluded that the dimension of

With exactly the same argument, we can show that

This theorem shows that the definition of dimension is reasonable and realizes
our motivation, which indeed reveals the local difference among

.

Now since we are in the world of graphs, it would be natural to ask what the
interaction between the dimension and other concepts in graph theory is. Since the
concept is completely new, I believe there would be many results waiting to be found.
Here we will give some fundamental results which could be enlightening.
Firstly we would like to show that the dimension controls the chromatic number
χ, which is the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices such that no
two adjacent vertices having the same color.
Theorem 2:
( )≤(

( )+ )∙⌈

| |⌉

Proof: To prove this theorem, we need to characterize the chromatic number in the
language of degrees, which is stated in the following lemma

Lemma 2
If G is of chromatic number n, then there is a sub-graph
each point in

of G such that

′ has degree not less than n-1

Proof :
We consider the critical sub-graph, which means that taking out any vertex will
make the chromatic number decrease 1. It is deserved to be pointed out that taking
any point out of a graph will either keep the chromatic number or let it reduce 1. Since
we can keep taking out vertices that are not relevant to the chromatic number, we will
ultimately reach a critical sub-graph G′ of G with chromatic n.
Since it is critical, we know that taking out any point will make its chromatic
number to be n-1. Suppose there is indeed a point x in G′ with degree less than n-1,
7

then we can first take x out and color the rest points. After that we take back x and
choose a suitable color among those n-1 ones, which is possible since x has degree
less than n-1 and forbids at most n-2 colors. This construction contradicts with the
fact that G′ has chromatic number n. So we know the assumption that x has degree
less than n-1 is wrong, which proves the lemma for lemma 2
Now we come back to the proof of theorem 2. From the definition of dimension,
we know that there is a sub-graph G of G with

| |

+ 1 point and has degree not

more than dim(G), which means that each point of G has degree less or equal to
dim(G). From the lemma we know that the chromatic number of G′ is at most
dim(G)+1. After that we delete all the points of G′ from G and continue what we did
before. Since the dimension is monotonic, dim(G) is not less than dim(G\G′).
Continue the process until we get a point at last.
In this process we get split the vertex set of G into at most ⌈

| |⌉ distinct

groups, each having chromatic number at most dim(G)+1. So we can now color them
in the way that vertices in the different groups has completely different colors, while
inside the same group we know their chromatic number is not more than dim(G)+1
from the argument above. Thus the chromatic number of G is at most (dim(G) + 1) ∙
⌈

| |⌉.
In the proof above we apply the strategy that split the whole graph into several

distinct sub-graphs and treat them separately. One might try to find a finer estimate
with more consideration on the interaction between the sub-graphs mentioned above,
which could be tricky and needs more information on the structure of the graph.
Recall that there is a former definition of graph proposed by Erd ̈ s, Harary and
Tutte in [1], which we may denote it as
Since it is not good at revealing the local structure of the graph, we proposed the
8

new definition mention above. Now it would be natural to think about the relationship
between those two concepts of dimension. Now we can show that in some sense
is controlled by dim from above.
Corollary 1:
( )≤ (

( )+ )∙⌈

| |⌉

Proof:
Here we introduce a Lemma proposed in Ref. [1]
Lemma 3 ( [1] )
( )≤

( )

Proof:
Firstly, we reserve two dimensions for each color, which means that we need
2χ(G) dimensions in total. Set the coordinates such that points are all in the

√

-circle

and have non-zero coordinates only when restricting to the two dimensions
corresponding to their color. For example, those with the color 1 has coordinates like
(a,b,0,0,…,0), where

+

= . Since any two adjacent points must have different

colors, we know that the distance between them must be 1 for lemma 3
Now the corollary 1 is immediately gotten from theorem 2 and lemma 3, because
(G) ≤ 2χ(G) ≤ 2(dim(G) + 1) ∙ ⌈

| |⌉
