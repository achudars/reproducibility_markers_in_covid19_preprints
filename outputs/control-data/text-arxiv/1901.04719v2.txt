ABSTRACT
Context. Simultaneous γ-ray measurements of γ-ray burst spectra and polarization offer a unique way to determine the
underlying emission mechanism(s) in these objects, as well as probing the particle acceleration mechanism(s) that lead
to the observed γ-ray emission
Aims. We examine the jointly observed data from POLAR and Fermi-GBM of GRB 170114A to determine its spectral
and polarization properties, and seek to understand the emission processes that generate these observations. We aim to
develop an extensible and statistically sound framework for these types of measurements applicable to other instruments.
Methods. We leveraged the existing 3ML analysis framework to develop a new analysis pipeline for simultaneously modeling the spectral and polarization data. We derived the proper Poisson likelihood for γ-ray polarization measurements
in the presence of background. The developed framework is publicly available for similar measurements with other
γ-ray polarimeters. The data are analyzed within a Bayesian probabilistic context and the spectral data from both
instruments are simultaneously modeled with a physical, numerical synchrotron code.
Results. The spectral modeling of the data is consistent with a synchrotron photon model as has been found in a
majority of similarly analyzed single-pulse gamma-ray bursts. The polarization results reveal a slight trend of growing
polarization in time reaching values of ∼ 30% at the temporal peak of the emission. We also observed that the
polarization angle evolves with time throughout the emission. These results suggest a synchrotron origin of the emission
but further observations of many GRBs are required to verify these evolutionary trends. Furthermore, we encourage the
development of time-resolved polarization models for the prompt emission of gamma-ray bursts as the current models
are not predictive enough to enable a full modeling of our current data.

1. Introduction
Polarization measurements from astrophysical objects are a
key piece of information to decipher the physics and geometry of regions that emit the observed photons. The emission
from γ-ray bursts (GRBs) has been notoriously difficult to
understand due to the complexity of modeling their broadband, prompt γ-ray emission. Recent results have provided
evidence that the prompt emission is the result of synchrotron radiation from electrons accelerated to ultra-high
energies via magnetic reconnection (Burgess et al. 2014;
Zhang et al. 2016, 2018; Burgess et al. 2019). Measurements
of the optical polarization from a GRB’s prompt emission
have similarly pointed to a synchrotron origin of the emission (Troja et al. 2017). However, spectral modeling of photospheric based emission has also provided adequate fits to
a subset of GRBs (Ryde et al. 2010; Ahlgren et al. 2015;
Vianello et al. 2018b). Measurements of polarization can
break this degeneracy (Toma et al. 2009; Gill et al. 2018).

Photospheric emission will typically produce unpolarized
emission although a moderate polarization level is possible
in special circumstances (Lundman et al. 2018) and predicts very specific changes of the polarization angle (Lundman et al. 2014). On the other hand, synchrotron emission
naturally produces a range of polarized emission depending
on the structure of the magnetic field and outflow geometry
(Waxman 2003; Lyutikov et al. 2003; Granot 2003). Thus,
being able to fit synchrotron emission to the observed spectrum while simultaneously detecting polarization provides
a clear view of the true emission process.
Several reports of polarization measurements have been
produced by a variety of instruments. An overview of which
can be found in (S. Covino 2016). Of these measurements,
those by non-dedicated instruments like those reported by
BATSE and RHESSI suffer from problems with instrumental effects or poorly understood systematics (McConnell
2017) making it impossible to draw conclusions based on

these results. Additionally, several measurements were performed using data from two instruments onboard the INTEGRAL satellite, IBIS, and SPI. Several of the GRB polarization measurements performed by these instruments
do not suffer from obvious errors in the analysis and allow
us to constrain the polarization parameter space. However,
for several of these measurements systematic uncertainties
also make it difficult to draw conclusions (McGlynn, S. et al.
2007). Furthermore as stated in for example (Pearce et al.
2019), a lack of on-ground calibration of the instrument
responses of both IBIS and SPI to polarized beams creates additional doubt on the validity of polarization results
from these instruments within the community. This indicates the importance of performing polarization measurements with carefully calibrated and dedicated instrumentation. More recently, the AstroSAT collaboration has reported preliminary polarization analysis results of several
GRBs on the arXiv e-Print archive (Chattopadhyay et al.
2017). The systematics and procedures related to obtaining
these measurements is not immediately clear. The quoted
error distributions contain unphysical regions of parameter space (polarization degrees greater than 100%) and are
thus questionable. Past measurements of polarization by
the first dedicated GRB polarimeter, GAP, provided hints
of polarized emission (Yonetoku et al. 2011). The results
presented there indicate an overall low polarization potentially resulting from an evolution of the polarization angle
during the long multipulse GRB, something also reported
in (Götz et al. 2009) for GRB 041219A. Measurements by
COSI provided an upper limit on the polarization degree
(Lowell et al. 2017). The statistics of these measurements
do not, however, allow constraints on the emission mechanisms. Furthermore, the techniques for all these measurements relied on background subtraction. As both the background and signal counts are Poisson distributed, subtraction is an invalid procedure that destroys statistical information, thus all reported significances are questionable.
The POLAR experiment (Produit et al. 2018) on board
the Chinese space laboratory Tiangong-2 observed 55 GRBs
and reported polarization measurements for five of these
GRBs (Zhang et al. 2019). Time-integrated analysis of these
GRBs resulted in strict upper limits on the polarization degrees. The most likely polarization degrees found in that
analysis are non-zero but remain compatible with an unpolarized emission, leading to the conclusion that GRBs are at
most moderately polarized. Using time-resolved analysis it
was however found that the polarization of GRB 170114A
was most compatible with a constant polarization degree of
∼ 28% with a varying polarization angle. Summing polarized fluxes with varying polarization degrees produces an
unpolarized flux. The detection of an evolution in polarization angle within this single pulse GRB could explain
the low polarization degrees found for all five GRBs. The
results presented in (Zhang et al. 2019) do not, however
allow for a detailed time-resolved study of the remaining
four GRBs, nor do they allow determination of the nature
of the evolution of the polarization angle in GRB 170114A.
Coincidentally, several of the GRBs observed by POLAR were simultaneously observed by the Fermi -GBM. In
this paper, we present a technically advanced modeling of
the polarization and spectral data simultaneously with data
from both instruments. This allows the incorporation of information contained in both data sets leading to improved
sensitivity and an altogether more robust analysis. This

work is organized as follows: The methodology and modeling is described in Sections 2 and 3 and the results are
interpreted in Section 4.

2. Data analysis and methodology
For the analysis herein, we have developed a new approach
of simultaneously fitting both the spectral data from POLAR and GBM along with the POLAR scattering angle
(SA) or polarization data (the subset of POLAR data usable for polarization analysis selected with cuts as defined
in (Li et al. 2018)). This simultaneous fitting alleviates the
need for approximate error propagation of the spectral fits
into the polarization analysis. Using the abstract data modeling capabilities of 3ML1 (Vianello et al. 2015), a framework
was developed to directly model all data simultaneously
with a joint-likelihood in each dataset’s appropriate space.
Below, we describe in detail each part of the methodology.
We focus on the analysis of GRB 170114A (Veres 2017)
which is a single-pulse, bright GRB lasting approximately
10s which allows us to performed detailed time-resolved
spectroscopy. The event occurred on January 14th 2017
with an initially estimated fluence between 10-1000 keV of
∼ 1.93·10−5 erg cm−2 . The high peak flux of the GRB triggered an autonomous repoint request for the F ermi satellite, however, no LAT detection of photons occurred.
2.1. Location and temporal analysis
Spectral and polarization analysis for both GBM and POLAR rely on knowledge of the sky-position (δ) of the GRB
in question. As they are both all-sky surveyors, GBM and
POLAR lack the ability to image GRBs directly. However, using the BALROG technique (Burgess et al. 2018),
we can use the spectral information obtained in the GBM
data to locate the GRB. Using a synchrotron photon model
(see Section 3), we were able to locate the GRB to RA=
13.10 ± 0.5 deg, DEC=−13.0 ± 0.6 deg. Using this location,
spectral and polarization responses were generated for all
data types. We note that a standard GBM position 2 exists
and, along with their uncertainties, was used for the polarization results presented in (Zhang et al. 2019), however,
the standard localization technique has known systematics and now possess arbitrarily inflated error distributions
(Connaughton et al. 2015). We find the BALROG derived
location much more precise than that of the standard location analysis (see Fig 1), allowing us to reduce the systematic errors included in the polarization results presented in
(Zhang et al. 2019). Additionally, it has now been shown
that the BALROG locations as systematically more accurate (Berlato et al. 2019).
The chief focus of this analysis is temporal variation in
the polarization parameters. We computed the minimum
variability timescale (MVT) (see Vianello et al. 2018b, for
details) on the POLAR SA light curve. The MVT infers
the minimum timescale above the Poisson noise floor of
which variability exists in the data. This yields an MVT of
∼ 0.3 s (Fig. 3). For completeness, the MVTs for both the
GBM and POLAR spectral light curves were computed as
well. Both analyses yield similar results. Therefore, we were

able to analyze data on this timescale without the concern
of summing over evolution of spectral (Burgess & Ryde
2015). However, the raw polarization data do not allow for
us to check for variability in the polarization angle prior to
fitting. Therefore, it is possible that the angle could change
on a timescale smaller than our selected time-intervals. This
could reduce the overall inferred polarization.
With the MVT determined, we utilized the Bayesian
blocks algorithm (Scargle et al. 2013) to objectively identify temporal bins for the analysis. The SA light curve was
utilized to perform the analysis. The temporal bins created
are on the order of the MVT. A total of nine bins were selected and used for spectral and polarization analysis (see
Table 4.1).
2.2. Spectral analysis
The standard γ-ray forward-folding approach to spectral
fitting is adopted, in which we have sky location (δ) dependent responses for both the GBM and POLAR detectors
(Rγ ) and fold the proposed photon model (nγ ) solution
through these responses to produce detector count spectra
(npha ). Thus,

GRB. Both POLAR and GBM have Poisson-distributed total observed counts, and their backgrounds determined via
fitting polynomials in time to off-source regions of the light
curves. Thus, Gaussian-distributed background counts are
estimated by integrating these polynomial models over the
source interval of interest. The uncertainty on these estimated counts is derived via standard Gaussian uncertainty
propagation. This leads us to use a Poisson-Gaussian likelihood3 for each detector for the spectral fitting.

This is known as PGSTAT in XSPEC.

To enable performing joint fits of the spectra and the polarization a novel analysis technique was developed. Traditional polarization analysis techniques, such as those employed in (Yonetoku et al. 2011; Chattopadhyay et al. 2017)
as well as in (Zhang et al. 2019), rely on fitting data to responses produced for a specific spectrum. This method does
not allow joint fits of both the spectrum and polarization
parameters, nor does it allow naturally including systematic
uncertainties from the spectral fits into the systematic uncertainties of the polarization. Here, in order to model the
polarization signal seen in the data, we invoked a forwardfolding method similar in concept to our approach to spectral analysis. We simulated polarized signals as function of
polarization angle, degree and energy to create a matrix of
SA distributions (often called modulation curves within the
field of polarimetry) which can be compared to the data via

where nθ are counts in SA bin k, and Rθ is the simulated
response of the corresponding scattering bin. In words, we
convolved the photon spectrum over the j th photon energy
bin with the polarization response to properly weight the
number of counts observed in each SA bin. Figure 4 demonstrates how changes in polarization angle and degree appear
in the POLAR data space. Hence, our need to simultaneously fit for the photon spectrum which allows for direct
accounting of the uncertainties in the weighting.
POLAR observed SAs are measured as detector counts
and thus Poisson distributed. The pollution of the source
signal by background cannot be handled by background
subtraction as has been done in previous work. Instead,
a temporally off-source measurement of the background
polarization is made in order to model the background
contribution to the total measurement during the observation intervals. The background measurement is Poisson
distributed in each of the k scattering bins. Due to the temporal stability of the background, as presented in (Zhang
et al. 2019), we fit a polynomial in time to each of the k scattering bins via an unbinned Poisson likelihood. This allowed
us to reduce the uncertainty of the background by leveraging the temporal information. We were able to estimate the
on-source background contribution (bkθ ) by integrating the
polynomials over time and propagating the temporal fit errors. This implies that the polarization likelihood is also a
Poisson-Gaussian likelihood just as with the spectral data.
We verified that our approach allowed us to identify the
latent polarization parameters via simulations in Appendix
B. The count rates are corrected for the proper exposure
by computing the total dead-time fraction associated with
each interval. The method employed for dead-time calculation is equivalent to that of Zhang et al. (2019).
The full joint likelihood of the data is thus a product
over the spectral and polarization likelihoods which is detailed in Appendix C (see also Figure 5). We re-emphasize
that the spectral model and polarization model communiArticle number, page 4 of 20

The green lines for both angles represent the polarization degree p̄ = 0, and the red lines p̄ = 100. Thus, we can see how
various sets of polarization parameters can be identified in the
data. The peaks with a 90◦ periodicity are the result of POLAR’s square shape, while the visible modulation with a 360◦
period is a result of the incoming direction of the photons with
respect to the instrument’s zenith. By forward-modeling the instrument response, the systematics induced by geometrical effects are properly accounted for.

cate with each other through the likelihood. This implies
that the posterior density of the model is fully propagated
to both datasets without any assumptions such as Gaussian
error propagation. As is seen in the following sections, the
resulting parameter distributions can be highly asymmetric.
In a perfect world where all instruments are crosscalibrated over the full energy range, the instruments’ various responses would predict similar observed fluxes for each
measurement. However, we allowed for a normalization constant between GBM and POLAR to account for any unmodeled discrepancies between the instruments. Both POLAR’s polarization and spectral data are scaled by these

assumption. However, as discussed in Section 5, the theoretical predictions for GRB synchrotron models are not
mature enough for us to assume such a prior at the current
time. Nevertheless, in our work we tested Gaussian priors
centered at moderate polarization and found that the data
allowed for this assumption. Moreover, we found that our
recovered φ was not affected by out choice of prior on p̄.

constants which are unity when no correction is required4 .
This constant scale for the effective area by no means accounts for energy-dependent calibration issues.
In order to obtain the posterior parameter distributions,
we used MULTINEST (Feroz et al. 2009; Buchner et al. 2014)
to simulate the model’s posterior. MULTINEST utilizes nested
sampling which is suitable for the multimodal distributions
we observe, as well as for the non-linear model and highdimension of our parameter space. For the polarization
parameters, we used uninformative priors of appropriate
scale. The effective area normalizations are given informative (truncated Gaussians) priors centered at unity with a
10% width. The priors for the spectral modeling are discussed in the Section 3. We ran MULTINEST with 1500 live
points to achieve a high number of samples for posterior
inference. Model comparison was not attempted and thus
we did not use the marginal likelihood calculations5 .
As stated, for both p̄ and φ, we used uninformative priors in each parameters’ domain. This is a valid choice for
φ, but we note that an informative prior for the expected
polarization from synchrotron emission could be used as an

For our numerical calculations we created a 300-point
grid, logarithmically distributed in γ. The linear equations
in the implicit scheme form a tridiagonal matrix which is
solved numerically with standard methods. The method of
Chang & Cooper (1970) is numerically stable and inexpensive as well as shown to conserve particle number in the
absence of sources and sinks. Thus, we are able to solve for
the synchrotron emission spectrum quickly during each iteration of the fit. The numeric code is implemented in C++ and
interfaced with Python into astromodels (Vianello et al.
2018a).
The overall emission is characterized by five parameters:
B, γinj , γcool , γmax , and p. However, a strong co-linearity

A&A proofs: manuscript no. 35056corr

exists between B and γinj as their combination sets the
peak of the photon spectrum. Thus, both parameters serve
as an energy scaling which forces the setting of one of the
parameters. We chose to set γinj = 105 though the choice
is arbitrary and does not affect our results. It is therefore
important to note that all parameters are determined relatively, that is, the values of γcool and γmax are determined as
ratios to γinj . Similarly, the value of B is only meaningful
when determining the characteristic energies of γcool and
γmax or hνcool and hνmax respectively. In other words, with
our parameterization the spectra are scale free. The degeneracies can be eliminated by specifying temporal and radial
properties of the GRB outflow which we have neglected in
this analysis.
Ideally, we would fit for the full set of parameters in
the model. However, the already high-dimensionality of the
model does not allow us to fit for the cooling regime of the
model simultaneously with the polarization due to computational time constraints. Therefore, we first fit the spectral data alone to determine the amount of cooling present
in the data. All spectra were found in the slow-cooling
regime (Sari et al. 1998; Beniamini & Piran 2013). Thus,
we fixed the ratio of γcool to γinj during the full fits to the
slow-cooling regime. Tests revealed that the cooling had
no impact on the recovered polarization parameters. Additionally, the lack of high-energy data (via the Fermi -LAT)
forces us to fix γmax such that the synchrotron cutoff is
above the spectral window. We obtain three parameter fit
for the spectrum: B, p and the arbitrary spectral normalization (K). B and K are given uninformative scale priors
and p a weakly-informative, Gaussian prior centered around
p = 3.5. The effective area constants applied to the POLAR
response are given truncated Gaussian priors centered at
unity with a width of 10% to reflect our prior belief that
the instruments are well-calibrated to one another6 .

was excluded for this single pulse GRB with 99.7% confidence. The analysis presented here does, however, allow
us to study the time evolution in significantly more detail.
This is because, unlike in the study (Zhang et al. 2019), the
polarization degree is not forced to be equal over all the
studied time intervals but is instead left as a free parameter, while the number of studied time bins is increased from
three to nine. Despite this significant increase in free parameters constraining measurements can still be performed. We
observe no polarization at the beginning of the pulse and
moderate (∼ 30%) polarization as time proceeds. Interestingly, we observe a large change in the polarization angle
with time (see Figure 8). Although the time intervals used
in this study are different from those used in (Zhang et al.
2019), it can be deduced that the polarization angles found
here agree with those in (Zhang et al. 2019). The end of the
pulse has a relatively weak signal and thus poorly identified polarization parameters. The 68% credible regions are
listed in Table 4.1. Clearly, the level of polarization during the peak of the emission is probabilistically equivalent
to both moderate, low or even 0% polarization during several intervals whereas during the beginning of the emission
the polarization is definitely low even though the ratio of
background to total signal is high.
We stress that it is not appropriate to perform model
comparison on nested model parameters, for example, comparing between zero polarization and greater than zero polarization. This includes the use of Bayes factors (Chattopadhyay et al. 2017) which are ill-defined for improper
priors and for comparing between discrete values of a continuous parameter (Gelman et al. 2013). Polarization is not
a detected quantity, but a parameter. Given that we have
detected the GRB, it is important to quote the credible
regions of the polarization parameter rather than perform
model comparison between discrete values.

4. Results

4.2. Spectra

In the following two sections, we present the results from
the combined polarization and spectral analysis separately.
Corner plots of the important (non-nuisance) parameter
marginal distributions are displayed in Appendix D.

POLAR and GBM observed data both agree in overall spectral shape and relative normalization of the observed flux.
Moreover, the spectral results demonstrate that the synchrotron spectrum is a good, predictive description of the
spectral data as displayed in Figure 9. This is both a confirmation that past studies with synchrotron relying on GBM
data alone are reliable, as well as the outstanding calibration between the GBM and POLAR.
As noted above, it is not possible to disentangle the
intrinsic parameters of the synchrotron emission without
further assumptions. Therefore, we only quote the injection energy in Table 4.1. The evolution of the spectrum
is shown in Figure 10. The temporal evolution of the νFν
spectral peak follows a broken power law. We find values between approximately three and four for the electron power
law injection spectral index. These values are steeper than
those of the canonical index expected from shock acceleration (Kirk et al. 2000).
It is possible that other physical spectral models also
provide acceptable, predictive, fits to the data. However,
these models – for example subphotospheric dissipation –
have yet to demonstrate acceptable spectral fits on a large
sample of GRBs. Moreover, the numerical schemes (Pe’er &
Waxman 2005) required to compute the emission form these
models are more complex than that of our synchrotron
modeling, require far more computational time, and are not

4.1. Polarization
The POLAR polarization data are well described by our
modeling of the POLAR instrument. The scattering angle data show good agreement between the data and the
model as demonstrated in Figure 6. In order to validate the
model’s ability to generate the data, we performed posterior
predictive checks (PPCs) (Betancourt 2018) of the polarization data for all time intervals. For a subset of posterior
samples chosen with appropriate posterior probability, latent polarization and spectral models were generated and
subsequent data quantities where sampled from the likelihood. The model was able to sufficiently generate replicated
data similar to the observed (see Figure 7) in most cases.
It is likely that minor deficiencies still exist in the instrumental responses.
The polarization observed here is compatible with that
presented in (Zhang et al. 2019) where an unpolarized flux

require special geometrical setups to produce polarization.
This makes them more predictive, and indeed a pertinent
set of models to test.

5. Discussion
For the first time, the polarization and spectrum of GRB
prompt γ-ray emission has been fitted simultaneously. Furthermore, the spectral data have been described with a
physical synchrotron model consistent with the spectral
data of two very distinct spectrometers. We argue that it
is unlikely for the spectral and polarization data to conspire to point toward an optically thin synchrotron origin
of the emission. However, the current predictive power of
GRB prompt emission polarization theory is not developed
enough for our measurements to definitively select synchrotron over other emission mechanisms. Therefore, we
speculatively leverage previous spectral results that show
that synchrotron emission is dominant mechanism in singlepulse GRBs.
Burgess et al. (2019) argue that the observation of synchrotron emission in GRBs invalidates the standard fireball
model (Eichler & Levinson 2000). Similar predictions were

made before they were supported by data (e.g., Zhang &
Pe’er 2009). These results allude to a magnetically dominated jet acceleration mechanism possibly resulting in comoving emission sites or mini-jets (Barniol Duran et al.
2016; Beniamini et al. 2018). These results were arrived at
considering spectral analysis alone. The moderate polarization degree observed in this work requires a development in
the prediction of the temporal polarization predictions of
these models in order to fully interpret their meaning.
While our observations provide broad ranges for the observed polarization degree, the changing polarization angle
is easily observed. Although an evolution of the polarization
angle has been reported before for multipulse GRBs using
data from both the GAP and IBIS instruments, (Yonetoku
et al. 2011; Götz et al. 2009) this intrapulse evolution has
not been observed before. Figure 11 shows the way in which
the both the peak of the synchrotron spectrum and the polarization angle grossly track each other in time. Detailed
model predictions for the evolution of the polarization angle
during the GRB are not available. We are therefore not able
to interpret the change in angle and encourage the community to develop detailed predictions which can be fitted to
our data in the future. With more predictive models, appropriate informative priors can be adopted. Moreover, spec-

Fig. 8. Posterior polarization results. The radial coordinate represents polarization degree and the angular coordinate the polarization angle. The polarization angle here is transformed to equatorial coordinates. The contours are for the 30th , 60th , and 90th
percentiles of the credible regions. The plots are reflected about the periodic boundary of 180◦ for visual clarity. For the last three
time intervals, we do not display contours and instead show the posterior samples as the parameters are poorly identified. The
arrows that point from the last to the current position are meant as visual guides only.

tral parameters can be formulated in terms of polarization
parameters making the models stricter and the data more
useful. Thus, we are hopeful that models are developed in
the near future.
The combination of POLAR and GBM observations
of GRBs enables energy-dependent polarization measurements and is a project currently under development. These

measurements will allow us to decipher if polarization increases around the peak of the photon spectrum which
would be a signature of synchrotron emission, or if the polarization is higher at low energies as predicted by Lundman
et al. (2018). We encourage researchers to carry out further
multimessenger studies and missions to answer these questions.

6. Software availability
The analysis software utilized in this study are primarily
3ML and astromodels. We have designed a generic, preliminary, polarization likelihood for similar X-ray polarization instruments both within 3ML7 and astromodels8 . Additionally, the POLAR pipeline9 we have developed is fully
designed to be easily modified for other instruments with
polarimetric data. We note that these software distributions are preliminary, and we encourage the community to
participate in their development.

Appendix A: The POLAR polarization response
The POLAR instrument is described in full detail in (Produit et al. 2018). The instrument design is such that issues found in previously reported polarization measurements are mitigated, for example fast electronics allows to
record events within a 50 ns coincidence window, thereby
removing chance coincidence induced events which can induce fake polarization. The POLAR response was modeled
using the POLAR simulation software presented in Kole
et al. (2017) which was previously used for the analysis
presented in (Zhang et al. 2019). The spectral and polarization response are produced using the same simulation set.
Different event selections were applied to produce the spectral and polarization response; whereas all clean photonlike triggers, as defined in Li et al. (2018), were used for
the spectral response, additional cuts are applied in the
event selection for the polarization response. This causes
the count rate to be higher in the spectral light curve than
in the polarization light curve as seen in Figure 2. The selection criteria for polarization events are equal to those
previously used in Zhang et al. (2019). In this event selection only triggers containing at least two energy depositions
in non-neighboring bars are selected.
Simulations were performed for a grid of polarization
parameters with steps of three degrees in φ while for p̄ only
0 and 100% were simulated. All additional values of p̄ on
the grid can be produced by combining these results. Such a
grid in polarization space was produced for photon energies
in the range of 30 to 850 keV in steps of 5 keV, thereby
producing a 3D grid of the instrument response. The final
result of each simulation is a binned modulation curve, with
a total number of 360 bins, normalized to the effective area
of POLAR for the specific photon energy. We note here
that the effective area is found to be independent of the
polarization, as could be naively expected. Therefore, the
polarization sensitivity is proportional to the source counts,
and thus highest in the ∼50-150 keV range.
Uncertainties in the simulated response are taken into
account by adding an additional uncertainty to each bin
in addition to that coming from the statistical uncertainty.
As presented in (Li et al. 2018) the main uncertainty in
the response stems from uncertainties of the gain calibration. The propagation of this uncertainty to the polarization response was studied here and is found to result in a
typical relative uncertainty of 2% for each bin in the polarization response. All other uncertainties, such as those
from other calibration parameters or uncertainties in the
mass model of both POLAR and the surrounding materials, are found to be negligible, as previously presented in
(Li et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2019). The systematic uncertainties in the polarization stemming from spectral uncertainties are naturally included by fitting for the spectrum
and the polarization at the same time. Finally, unlike in
the results presented in (Zhang et al. 2019) the location induced uncertainty is negligible in this analysis due to the
highly precise location acquired using the BALROG.

Appendix B: Polarization assessment
We wish to validate our analysis method via simulations to
verify that under the assumption of the true model our inferences are identifiable. Therefore, we created simulations
of both spectra and polarization for sets of (φ, p̄) and an

The true simulated polarization degrees and lines are demonstrated with green lines and gray rays respectively. The posterior

our posteriors encapsulate the simulated values directly without
resorting to the statistical approximations of past works.

assumed power law spectrum and fit them with the same
likelihood used for real data. To avoid pathologies that can
be introduced with energy dispersion, we assumed an x-ray
detector with an identity response and simulate a simple
power law photon spectrum. Both the POLAR response
and a simulated background are included as we are mainly
concerned with validating our polarization inferences.The
background simulations were performed by sampling events
from real in-orbit data recorded by POLAR in a period both
before and after the GRB 170114A. It should be noted here
that the SA distribution of the POLAR background was
found to be very stable (Zhang et al. 2019).
We simulated a nested grid of φ ∈ {0◦ , 160◦ } in steps
of 20◦ and p̄ ∈ {0, 90} in steps of ten. We simulated at
both low and high signal-to-noise ratio levels. The partial
results from the high signal-to-noise ratio simulations are
shown in Figure B.1. Simulations at lower signal-to-noise
ratios provide similar results but with broader parameter
credible regions. From our simulations, we are satisfied that
our construction of the likelihood provides valid inferences.
In Figure B.2 we display the posterior samples of the
POLAR polarization and spectral normalization constants.
The values obtained are not dissimilar from the values typically found between GBM detectors when those parameters
are allowed to vary in the fits (Yu et al. 2016).

Appendix C: The likelihood
Here we specify the full likelihood utilized in the analysis.
We first defined basic distributions, that is, the Gaussian
and Poisson distributions respectively:

The data from POLAR and GBM are inherently Poissondistributed as they are counting experiments. The total
count data in the ith detector channel (Ni ) are a mixture
of latent source(si ) and background (bi ) events. The transient nature of GRBs allowed us to naively separate the
source observations into temporally on- and off-source regions. The background could then be modeled temporally
in each detector channel as a polynomial resulting in estimate of the background counts (Bi ) with and associated
error (σBi ). Thus our data for each detector channel (both
PHA and SA channels) are the total counts Ni , Bi , and
σBi . It is immediately obvious that we cannot simply subtract the background counts from the data as we (i) cannot

know which counts are background and (ii) the background
process has statistical properties. Thus, we must model the
joint probability of the total and background process as

πPG (Ni | si , bi , Bi , σBi ) = πP (Ni | si + bi ) πN (Bi | bi , σBi ) .
(C.3)

In our situation we did not have a spectral or polarization
model for the background process. Thus, we adopt the common procedure of maximizing the probability with respect
to bi a priori leading to the profile likelihood referred to as
PGSTAT10 .

Previous γ-ray polarization estimates have been
achieved via background-subtracted data with the assumption of a Gaussian likelihood. This is improper and can
lead to systematically biased results. There have also been
attempts to transfer the statistical techniques used in optical polarimetry (Vaillancourt 2006; Quinn 2012) to γ-rays.
These techniques are invalid for measurements that infer
latent polarization via a secondary measurement such as
the Compton scattering angle of a photon. Moreover, these
techniques assume that none of the inherent difficulties of
γ-ray photon measurement are present, namely, low counts
and dispersion both in energy and scattering angle. We have
dealt with this first issue via the proper Poisson-based likelihood. The second issue via our modeling of the responses
of our instruments directly in the inference process.

Appendix D: Parameter corner plots
Here we present the parameter corner plots for the time
intervals described in the analysis sections. See Figures D.1
-D.9 for these distributions. We have also plotted the posterior samples from the polarization analysis on a Cartesian
grid for completeness in Figure D.10.
