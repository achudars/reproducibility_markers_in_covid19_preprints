The importance of the classical channel in
the impurity transport of optimized
stellarators

In toroidal magnetic confinement devices, such as tokamaks and stellarators, neoclassical
transport is usually an order of magnitude larger than its classical counterpart. However,
when a high-collisionality species is present in a stellarator optimized for low PfirschSchlüter current, its classical transport can be comparable to the neoclassical transport.
In this letter, we compare neoclassical and classical fluxes and transport coefficients
calculated for Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) and Large Helical Device (LHD) cases. In W7X, we find that the classical transport of a collisional impurity is comparable to the
neoclassical transport for all radii, while it is negligible in the LHD cases, except in
the vicinity of radii where the neoclassical transport changes sign. In the LHD case,
electrostatic potential variations on the flux-surface significantly enhance the neoclassical
impurity transport, while the classical transport is largely insensitive to this effect in the
cases studied.

1. Introduction
The most developed concepts for achieving controlled thermonuclear fusion are the
tokamak and stellarator. Both the tokamak and the stellarator utilize a strong toroidal
magnetic field to confine a hot plasma in which fusion reactions take place.
When such a plasma is in a steady-state, loss of particles and energy mainly occurs as
a result of micro-turbulence, collisions, or direct losses of particles on unconfined orbits.
The two latter processes – and the resulting transport of particles and heat – is referred
to as collisional transport, and can be modeled within the framework of drift-kinetics.
Historically this is the dominant transport channel in the core of stellarators because of
the large transport due to particles on unconfined orbits (Beidler et al. 2012).
Collisional transport can be further separated into two additive components: classical
transport, which is due to the gyro-motion of particles around the magnetic field-lines,
and neoclassical transport, which is due to the complex orbits carried out by the center
of gyration as it moves in the magnetic field. The latter typically leads to much larger
transport than the former (Pfirsch & Schlüter 1962), and also accounts for the unconfined
orbits in stellarators, with a very strong unfavorable scaling towards reactor-relevant
high temperatures. Thus, much effort has been devoted to reducing the neoclassical
transport in stellarators, resulting in optimized stellarators such as Wendelstein 7-X
(W7-X) (Nührenberg & Zille 1986), while classical transport is often neglected.
However, it has not been widely appreciated that, as a result of optimizing for
low neoclassical transport and Pfirsch-Schlüter current, the neoclassical transport of
impurities in W7-X can now be comparable to the often neglected classical transport.
The main purpose of the present note is to raise attention to this circumstance.
To understand why the classical transport is relevant in an optimized stellarator, we
employ recent analytical results on neoclassical transport for a collisional impurity (Braun

2
& Helander 2010; Helander et al. 2017; Newton et al. 2017) to show that the ratio of
classical to neoclassical fluxes is proportional to a geometrical factor (2.1), which turns
out to be larger than one in W7-X.
Motivated by these results, we present a general expression for the classical transport,
using the linearized Fokker-Planck operator and allowing for an arbitrary number of
species. The employed collision operator is frequently used in modern neoclassical solvers,
and the results can thus be directly compared with the output from such codes. In the
final sections, we look at a few example magnetic configurations, where we compare the
magnitude of the classical transport to that of the neoclassical transport calculated with
the Sfincs† drift-kinetic solver (Landreman et al. 2014), and investigate the collisionality
dependence of the ratio of classical to neoclassical transport.

2. Motivation
Before performing a detailed analysis, it is useful to consider a simple (but experimentally relevant) limit, where the importance of classical transport in a stellarator is
apparent. For this purpose, we summarize results from earlier work (Buller et al. 2018;
Braun & Helander 2010; Helander et al. 2017).
At fusion-relevant temperatures, the bulk hydrogen species of the confined plasma will
be in a low-collisionality regime. However, as the collisionality increases with charge,
high-Z impurities (with Z being the charge number) can still have high collisionality.
Such impurities can occur, for example, in experiments using tungsten plasma-facing
components, which is the favoured material for the divertor of future fusion reactors
(Bolt et al. 2002). These plasmas will thus be in a mixed-collisionality regime, with lowcollisionality bulk and high-collisionality impurity ions.
In this regime, the ratio of classical to neoclassical impurity particle fluxes calculated
from the mass-ratio expanded collision operator is given by a purely geometrical factor
(Buller et al. 2018)

Here, ψ is a radial coordinate (a flux surface label), h·i is the flux-surface average, Γz is
the flux of impurity ions, hΓz · ∇ψi(N)C is the radial (neo)classical impurity flux averaged
over the flux-surface, B is the magnetic field, B = |B|, and j is the current density, here
defined by j × B = ∇p(ψ), ∇ · j = 0; with jk and j⊥ being the current components
parallel and perpendicular to B, and p the total pressure.
Equation 2.1 also enters into the ratio of classical and neoclassical transport at yet
higher collisionalities: in the Pfirsch-Schlüter regime, where both bulk and impurity ions
are collisional. This can be shown using the expression for neoclassical transport derived
by Braun & Helander (2010) together with the expression for classical transport in,
for example in Buller et al. (2018). For stellarators optimized for low jk /j⊥ (such as
W7-X), the (2.1) ratio will be large and classical transport will thus dominate at high
collisionality. This will be verified by numerical simulations in Sec. 4.

3. Linearized Fokker-Planck operator
In this section, we write down the classical particle and heat transport due to a
linearized Fokker-Planck operator. The flux-surface averaged radial classical transport

a − 2 Ta Γa , where Ta
is the temperature of species ’a’.
For a magnetized plasma, it is useful to separate out the dependence of the distribution
function on the gyrophase. Only the gyrophase-dependent part of f , which we denote by
f˜, contributes to R and G perpendicular to the magnetic field, and thus to the classical
fluxes (3.1)–(3.2). For a magnetized plasma with an isotropic Maxwellian, it is well-known
that (Hazeltine 1973)
f˜a1 = −ρa · ∇fa0 ,

(3.5)

where ρa = B × vma /(Za eB 2 ) is the gyro-radius vector.
With (3.5), we can readily evaluate the classical transport given by (3.1)–(3.4). Lately
in stellarator research, the importance of flux-surface variation of the electrostatic potential has been recognized (Garcı́a-Regaña et al. 2017); such effects can be incorporated
into the classical transport by including the flux-surface varying part of the potential in
the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution f0 (Hinton & Wong 1985)

where ln Λ the Coulomb logarithm, and 0 the vacuum permittivity. These expressions
are valid for all collisionalities. In (3.9) and (3.10), the effect of Φ̃ is to induce a weighting
over the flux-surface due to the flux-surface variation of na and its radial gradient. Note
that the radial electric field (from hΦi and Φ̃) does not contribute in the above expression,
even when d ln η/dψ is expressed in terms of (3.7).
In (3.9)–(3.10), the |∇ψ|2 factors correspond to the j⊥ factor in (2.1), while the jk
factor in (2.1) arises due to the neoclassical transport (Braun & Helander 2010; Helander
et al. 2017). In the following section, we will evaluate the above expression for example
magnetic configurations.

4. Comparison to neoclassical calculations
In this section, we will compare the classical transport from (3.9) to the neoclassical
transport calculated with the drift-kinetic solver Sfincs. Unlike analytical calculations
of the neoclassical transport (Buller et al. 2018; Calvo et al. 2018), this procedure is
not limited to a specific collisionality regime, which will let us assess the importance of
classical transport for any collisionality.
For this study, we will look at two stellarator configurations, where the neoclassical
transport coefficients have been calculated across a wide range of collisionalities. Specifically, we will look at a simulated W7-X standard configuration case at the radial location
rN = 0.88, with T = 1 keV and impurity parameters Z p
= 6, Zeff = 2.0, studied by Mollén
et al. (2015). The normalized radius is defined as rN = ψt /ψt,LCFS , with ψt the toroidal
flux and ψt,LCFS its value at the last-closed flux-surface. Since W7-X has been optimized
for a low parallel current, and the standard configuration has low neoclassical transport
compared to other configurations, we here expect the classical transport to dominate
at high collisionality, as indicated at the end of Sec. 2. In addition, we will look at a
scenario based on an impurity hole plasma (#113208, t = 4.64 s, rN = 0.6, T = 3.2 keV)
of the Large Helical Device (LHD), where we replaced the mixture of helium and carbon

5
impurities with purely carbon (Zeff = 3.44) for the sake of comparison. This magnetic
configuration has been investigated in several studies, using both neoclassical (Velasco
et al. 2017; Mollén et al. 2018) and turbulence codes (Nunami et al. 2016).
Effects of Φ̃ and the radial electric field are not included in this demonstration (they
are zero in the simulations), as this would make the drift-kinetic equation nonlinear,
and add the complexity of finding the ambipolar electric field at each step. These effects
are not expected to strongly affect the classical transport, which is independent of the
radial electric field, and typically not as sensitive to Φ̃ as the neoclassical transport (Buller
et al. 2018). The neoclassical transport can be both enhanced or reduced by these effects,
which thus would affect the relative importance of classical transport. These effects will
be touched upon in Sec. 5. As Φ̃ = 0 in this section, the density is a flux-function, and
ηa = na .
We scan the collisionality by artificially scaling the collision frequency. For each point
in the collisionality scan, we calculate the neoclassical and classical transport coefficients
of the hydrogen bulk ion and the carbon impurity. The transport coefficients for the
(neo)classical fluxes are defined such that

where a = i, z for ions and impurities. We have neglected the effects of electron collisions
on the ion fluxes due to the small electron-to-ion mass-ratio, and assumed that the bulk

B00 2Ta /ma ab
where B00 , G and I are related to the Boozer representation of the magnetic field (see,
for example, Mollén et al. (2018)) and ι is the rotational transform. As seen in the left
panels of Fig. 1, the impurity transport coefficients in the W7-X geometry are dominantly
classical already for ν̂CC & 1. The cross-species contributions are dominantly classical
already for ν̂CC & 0.1, for both the bulk and the impurity ions. On the other hand, in LHD
– which has not been optimized for low |jk |/|j⊥ | – the classical transport for both species
at most collisionalities is at least an order of magnitude smaller than the neoclassical
transport. An exception to this is the Da,T coefficient, where the classical transport
becomes comparable or greater than the neoclassical transport at very high collisionalities
(ν̂CC & 100). Another exception occurs in the collisionality range νCC ∼ [0.1, 1], where
the cross-species neoclassical Dz,ni and Di,nz coefficients transition between different
signs.

5. Discussion
We have seen that the neoclassical and classical transport coefficients can be comparable in a W7-X standard configuration, even at modest impurity collisionality (ν̂CC & 0.1−
1), although the previously discussed simulations do not include effects of electrostatic
potential variation within and across flux-surfaces and collisions with electrons. To
demonstrate the relative importance of neoclassical and classical transport in realistic
scenarios with these effects included, we consider two cases in which the full neoclassical
behaviour has previously been analyzed by Mollén et al. (2018): a simulated neutral-beam

heated high-mirror W7-X scenario with inward electric field and neon impurities, and the
impurity hole LHD case of the previous section with an additional helium impurity.
The classical and neoclassical fluxes are shown in Fig. 2 (left panels, W7X; right panels,
LHD). We note that in the W7-X case, the classical to neoclassical neon flux ratio is
around 0.5 in magnitude at most radii, and its sensitivity to a finite Φ̃ is weak. This is
consistent with neon being the only collisional impurity in this discharge (with ν̂NeNe ∼
[0.5, 2.5])
In the LHD case, the classical flux is generally small, although the classical to neoclassical flux ratio for carbon and helium diverges at discrete points, where the neoclassical
flux crosses zero. Additionally, for Φ̃ = 0, there is a radial range (0.6 . rN . 0.8), with
small outward neoclassical carbon flux, where the neoclassical flux is only 5 times as
large as the classical. When the effect of Φ̃ is included, there is a large increase in the
neoclassical carbon flux for rN & 0.4, with the result that the classical-to-neoclassical
flux ratio remains small for these radii.
As all species in the LHD case are in a low collisionality regime, it is unlikely that the
low neoclassical transport for Φ̃ = 0 is due to small neoclassical transport coefficients,
when compared to the classical coefficients. Rather, it may be that the contributions
from the different neoclassical transport coefficients cancel out approximately. Including
potential variations both changes the individual transport coefficient and somewhat

reduces the ambipolar radial electric field in this case, both of which could affect this
cancellation.
The classical fluxes are comparable to the neoclassical fluxes in W7-X, and should not
generally be neglected in an analysis of the collisional transport. Based on this conclusion,
we have implemented the classical fluxes (3.9)–(3.10) as a post-processing step to the
neoclassical codes Sfincs and Dkes; see the supplementary material for an example
implementation in python.
As a final remark, we note that since the neoclassical transport in W7-X is sufficiently
low to be comparable to the classical, the transport due to micro-turbulence can become
relatively more important. It may thus be necessary to consider the effect of turbulence
on stellarator impurity transport in the future, which is often excluded due to the
computational expense of simulating turbulence in stellarator geometry (Nunami et al.
2013). Recent experimental studies by Langenberg et al. (2018) and Geiger et al. (2019)
already point strongly in that direction.
