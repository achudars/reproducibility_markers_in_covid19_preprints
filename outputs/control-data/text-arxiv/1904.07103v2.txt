Abstract
It is well known that stationary geometrically ergodic Markov chains are β-mixing (absolutely
regular) with geometrically decaying mixing coefficients. Furthermore, for initial distributions other
than the stationary one, geometric ergodicity implies β-mixing under suitable moment assumptions.
In this note we show that similar results hold also for subgeometrically ergodic Markov chains. In
particular, for both stationary and other initial distributions, subgeometric ergodicity implies βmixing with subgeometrically decaying mixing coefficients. Although this result is simple it should
prove very useful in obtaining rates of mixing in situations where geometric ergodicity can not be
established. To illustrate our results we derive new subgeometric ergodicity and β-mixing results
for the self-exciting threshold autoregressive model.

Introduction

Let Xt (t = 0, 1, 2, . . .) be a Markov chain on the state space X with n-step transition probability
measure P n and stationary distribution π. If the n-step probability measures P n converge in total
variation norm to the stationary probability measure π at rate r n (for some r > 1), that is,
lim r n kP n (x ; ·) − π(·)k = 0,

n→∞

π a.e.,

(1)

the Markov chain is said to be geometrically ergodic. It is well known that for stationary Markov chains,
geometric ergodicity implies that so-called β-mixing coefficients (or coefficients of absolute regularity)
β(n), to be defined formally in Section 2, converge to zero at the same rate, limn→∞ r n β(n) = 0 (see,
e.g., Doukhan (1994, p. 89), Bradley (2005, Thm 3.7), or Bradley (2007, Thm 21.19)). For initial
distributions other than the stationary one, a similar mixing result has been obtained by Liebscher
(2005, Propn 4).
We are interested in counterparts of these mixing results when the convergence in (1) takes place
at a rate r(n) slower than geometric, that is,
lim r(n)kP n (x ; ·) − π(·)k = 0,

n→∞

π a.e..

(2)

When (2) holds with suitably defined rates r(n) slower than geometric, the Markov chain is called
subgeometrically ergodic. The main result of this note establishes that for both stationary and other
initial distributions, subgeometric ergodicity implies β-mixing with subgeometrically decaying mixing
coefficients, that is, limn→∞ r̃(n)β(n) = 0 for some rate function r̃(n).
To illustrate some common rate functions, consider the expression
γ

r(n) = (1 + ln(n))α · (1 + n)β · ecn · edn ,

α, β, c, d ≥ 0, γ ∈ (0, 1), n ≥ 1.
γ

γ

In the case α, β, c, d > 0 the four terms above satisfy edn /ecn → ∞, ecn /(1 + n)β → ∞, and
(1 + n)β /(1 + ln(n))α → ∞ as n → ∞, and this hierarchy can be used to define different growth rates.
Ordered from the fastest to the slowest growth rate, a growth rate is called geometric (sometimes also
exponential) if the dominant term is edn (with d > 0; note that edn = r n with r > 1 iff d > 0),
γ
subexponential if the dominant term is ecn (c > 0 and above d = 0), polynomial if the dominant
term is (1 + n)β (β > 0, c = d = 0), and logarithmic if the dominant term is (1 + ln(n))α (α > 0,
β = c = d = 0).
To provide some brief background on subgeometric ergodicity, we note that the first subgeometric
ergodicity results for general state space Markov chains were obtained by Nummelin and Tuominen
(1983) and Tweedie (1983); the subgeometric rate functions r(n) considered were introduced by Stone
and Wainger (1967). Tuominen and Tweedie (1994) gave a set of conditions that imply the convergence
in (2) and, in particular, formulated a sequence of so-called drift conditions to establish subgeometric
ergodicity. Subsequent work by Fort and Moulines (2000), Jarner and Roberts (2002), Fort and
Moulines (2003), and Douc et al. (2004) lead to a formulation of a single drift condition to ensure
subgeometric ergodicity, paralleling the use of a Foster-Lyapunov drift condition to establish geometric
ergodicity (see, e.g., Meyn and Tweedie (2009, Ch 15)).
The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 contains necessary mathematical preliminaries.
Section 3 reviews the relation of geometric ergodicity and β-mixing, while the corresponding results in
the subgeometric case are given in Section 4. The general results obtained are exemplified in Section 5
where subgeometric ergodicity and β-mixing results for the self-exciting threshold autoregressive model
are presented. Section 6 concludes, and all proofs are given in an Appendix.

Preliminaries

To formalize the discussion in the Introduction, consider Xt (t = 0, 1, 2, . . .), a time-homogeneous
discrete-time Markov chain on a general measurable state space (X, B(X)). Comprehensive treatments
of the relevant Markov chain theory can be found in Meyn and Tweedie (2009) or Douc et al. (2018).
Let µ be any initial measure on B(X), and suppose that X0 has distribution µ. Denote the transition
probabilities with P (x ; A) (x ∈ X, A ∈ B(X)) and let (Ω, F, Pµ ) denote the probability space of the
Markov process {X0 , X1 , . . .}. As usual, Px denotes the probability measure corresponding to a fixed
initial value X0 = x and P n (x ; A) = Px (Xn ∈ A) (x ∈ X, A ∈ B(X)) signifies the n-step transition
probability measure.
Next consider the rate of convergence of the n-step probability measures P n to the stationary
probability measure π. To this end, for any two probability measures λ1 and λ2 on (X, B(X)), the total
variation distance is defined as kλ1 − λ2 k = 2 supB∈B(X) |λ1 (B) − λ2 (B)| = sup|h|≤1 |λ1 (h) − λ2 (h)|,
where the last supremum runs over all B(X)-measurable functions h : X → R bounded in absolute
R
value by 1 and λi (h) = X λi (dx)h(x) < ∞. The n-step probability measures P n converge in total
variation norm to the stationary probability measure π at rate r(n), n ≥ 0, if
lim r(n)kP n (x ; ·) − π(·)k = 0,

n→∞

π a.e..

(3)

If (3) holds we say that the Markov chain Xt is ergodic with rate r(n); geometric ergodicity obtains
when r(n) = r n for some r > 1.
To define the β-mixing coefficients, let Fkl , 0 ≤ k ≤ l ≤ ∞, signify the σ-algebra generated by
{Xk , . . . , Xl }. For the stochastic process {X0 , X1 , . . .} the β-mixing coefficients β(n), n = 1, 2, . . ., are
defined as (Doukhan (1994, Sec 1.1); Bradley (2007, Ch 3))

Process Xt is said to be β-mixing (or sometimes absolutely regular) if limn→∞ β(n) = 0. As with the

The geometric case

We start by briefly discussing the relation of geometric ergodicity and β-mixing; although these results
are well known, comparing them with the subgeometric case will be illuminating. In case of a stationary
Markov chain (i.e., one with initial distribution π), this relation is particularly simple. As was first
shown by Nummelin and Tuominen (1982, Thm 2.1), a geometrically ergodic Markov chain satisfies,
R
for some r > 1, limn→∞ r n π(dx) kP n (x ; ·) − π(·)k = 0; given expression (5), the β-mixing property
immediately follows and the mixing coefficients satisfy limn→∞ r n β(n) = 0. Statements of this result
can be found for instance in Doukhan (1994, p. 89), Bradley (2005, Thm 3.7), and Bradley (2007, Thm
21.19). For initial distributions other than the stationary one, a corresponding result seems to have
first appeared in Liebscher (2005, Propn 4).
To facilitate comparison with the subgeometric case, we present the ergodicity and mixing results
as consequences of a particular drift criterion; as is discussed in Meyn and Tweedie (2009), this is
how geometric ergodicity is often established. We use the following traditional Foster-Lyapunov type
geometric drift condition (cf. Meyn and Tweedie (2009, Thm 15.0.1)).1 Here 1C (·) signifies the indicator
function of a set C.
Condition Drift–G. Suppose there exist a petite set C, constants b < ∞, β > 0, and a measurable
function V : X → [1, ∞) such that supx∈C V (x) < ∞, satisfying
E [V (X1 ) | X 0 = x ] ≤ V (x) − βV (x) + b1C (x),

x ∈ X.

For the definition of a ‘petite set’ appearing in this condition, and for the concepts of irreducibility
and aperiodicity in the theorem below, we refer the reader to Meyn and Tweedie (2009). Theorem 1
summarizes the relation between geometric ergodicity and β-mixing.
Theorem 1. Suppose Xt is a ψ-irreducible and aperiodic Markov chain and that Condition Drift–G
holds. Then
(a) Xt is geometrically ergodic, i.e, for some r1 > 1, limn→∞ r1n kP n (x ; ·) − π(·)k = 0 for all x ∈ X.

(c) Xt is β-mixing and the mixing coefficients satisfy, for some r3 > 1, limn→∞ r3n β(n) = 0.
Moreover:

Parts (a) and (b) are very well known (see for instance Meyn and Tweedie (2009, Thm 15.0.1)
for part (a) and Nummelin and Tuominen (1982, Thm 2.3) for part (b)) and so is also the mixing
result in the stationary case (see the references given earlier). Part (c) for general initial distributions
was obtained by Liebscher (2005, Propn 4), although our formulation is somewhat different from his
1

As a technical remark, note that in Condition Drift–G we assume the function V to be everywhere finite (i.e.,
V : X → [1, ∞)) and such that supx∈C V (x) < ∞. In contrast, in Meyn and Tweedie (2009, Thm 15.0.1) it is only
assumed that V is extended-real-valued (i.e., V : X → [1, ∞]) and finite at some one x0 ∈ X. Our stronger requirements
hold in most practical applications and lead to more transparent exposition and proofs.

(our formulation and proof avoid the use of so-called ‘Q-geometric ergodicity’ employed by Liebscher;
for completeness, our proof of Theorem 1, which may be of independent interest, is provided in a
Supplementary Appendix). Part (d) elaborates parts (b) and (c) as well as their relation in the
stationary case.

The subgeometric case

We seek a counterpart of Theorem 1 in which the geometric rate r n is replaced by some slower rate
function; such rate functions were already exemplified in the Introduction. More formally, the subgeometric rate functions we consider are defined as follows (cf., e.g., Nummelin and Tuominen (1983)
and Douc et al. (2004)). Let Λ0 be the set of positive nondecreasing functions r0 : N → [1, ∞) such
that ln[r0 (n)]/n decreases to zero as n → ∞. The class of subgeometric rate functions, denoted by Λ,
consists of positive functions r : N → (0, ∞) for which there exists some r0 ∈ Λ0 such that
0 < lim inf
n→∞

r(n)
r(n)
≤ lim sup
< ∞.
r0 (n)

(6)

Typical examples are obtained of rate functions r for which these inequalities hold with (for notational
convenience, we set ln(0) = 0)
γ

r0 (n) = (1 + ln(n))α · (1 + n)β · ecn ,

α, β, c ≥ 0, γ ∈ (0, 1).

The rate function r0 (n) is called subexponential when c > 0, polynomial when c = 0 and β > 0, and
logarithmic when β = c = 0 and α > 0.
In analogy with the geometric case, subgeometric ergodicity and mixing results are most conveniently obtained by verifying an appropriate drift condition. The following drift condition for subgeometric ergodicity is adapted from Douc et al. (2018, Defn 16.1.7).2
Condition Drift–SubG. Suppose there exist a petite set C, a constant b < ∞, a concave increasing
continuously differentiable function φ : [1, ∞) → (0, ∞) satisfying limv→∞ φ′ (v) = 0, and a measurable
function V : X → [1, ∞) such that supx∈C V (x) < ∞ and
E [V (X1 ) | X 0 = x ] ≤ V (x) − φ(V (x)) + b1C (x),

x ∈ X.

Note that if φ(v) = ηv (η > 0), one obtains Condition Drift–G (but assumption limv→∞ φ′ (v) = 0
rules this out; as we are interested in subgeometric rates of ergodicity, assuming this means no loss of
generality, see Douc et al. (2018, Remark 16.1.8)).
Following Douc et al. (2004) we next introduce a rate function, denoted by rφ . First define the
R v dx
, where φ is as in Condition Drift–SubG. The definition implies that Hφ is a
function Hφ (v) = 1 φ(x)

nondecreasing, concave, and differentiable function on [1, ∞), and it has an inverse Hφ−1 : [0, ∞) →
[1, ∞) which is increasing and differentiable (see Douc et al. (2004, Sec 2.1)). Thus, we can define the
rate function
rφ (z) = (Hφ−1 )′ (z) = φ ◦ Hφ−1 (z).
Douc et al. (2004, Lemma 2.3 and Proposition 2.5) show that this rate function is subgeometric and
that Condition Drift–SubG implies the convergence (3) at rate rφ (n).
2

A somewhat more general drift condition, for instance allowing for V to be extended-real-valued, is given in Douc
et al. (2004).

Theorem 2 summarizes the relation between subgeometric ergodicity and β-mixing. Here ⌊k⌋
denotes the integer part of the real number k.

holds. Then

r̃φ (n) such that lim supn→∞ r̃φ (n)/rφ (n1 ) < ∞ where n1 = ⌊n/2⌋.
Moreover:
R
(d) In the stationary case (µ = π) condition X π(dx)V (x) < ∞ is not needed, (b) and (c) hold with

γ
r̃φ,0 (n) = (1 + ln(n))α · (1 + n)β · ec̃n for some 0 < c̃ < c2−γ , then lim supn→∞ r̃φ (n)/rφ (n1 ) < ∞.
Of the results in Theorem 2, part (a) is given in Proposition 2.5 of Douc et al. (2004). Part (b)
can be obtained by combining Theorem 4.1 of Tuominen and Tweedie (1994) and Proposition 2.5 of
Douc et al. (2004), but in the proof we make use of the work of Nummelin and Tuominen (1983).
Part (c) is new and illuminates the relation between subgeometrically ergodic Markov chains and their
β-mixing properties, thereby providing a counterpart of a result obtained by Liebscher (2005, Propn 4)
in the case of geometric ergodicity. Part (d) is analogous to its counterpart in Theorem 1 and provides
further insight to parts (b) and (c) whereas part (e) makes part (c) more concrete in the case of the
most common rate functions. For completeness, we give a detailed proof in the Appendix.
As discussed in Douc et al. (2004, Sec 2.3) and Meitz and Saikkonen (2019, Thm 1), there is
a connection between the function φ and the rate function rφ , which can be used to find out the
latter in particular cases. For instance, polynomial rate functions are associated with cases where
the function φ is of the form φ(v) = cv α with α ∈ (0, 1) and c ∈ (0, 1], and then the rate obtained
is rφ (n) = nα/(1−α) (an alternative form is rφ (n) = nκ−1 with κ = 1 + α/(1 − α) already given by
Jarner and Roberts (2002)). In the subexponential case the function φ is such that v/φ(v) goes to
infinity slower than polynomially so that a possibility, given in Meitz and Saikkonen (2019, Thm 1),
1/(1+α)
for
is φ(v) = c(v + v0 )/[ln(v + v0 )]α for some α, c, v0 > 0. This results in the rate rφ (n) = (ed )n
some d > 0 which is faster than polynomial. A logarithmic rate is an example of a rate slower than
polynomial. Then the function φ is of the form φ(v) = c[1 + ln(v)]α for some α > 0 and c ∈ (0, 1], and
the resulting rate is rφ (n) = [ln(v)]α (see Douc et al. (2004, Sec 2.3)).
Theorem 2 (or 1) also provides information about the moments of the stationary distribution of Xt .
Specifically, once part (a) of Theorem 2 (or 1) has been established, one can deduce from Condition
R
Drift–SubG (or Drift–G) and Theorem 14.3.7 of Meyn and Tweedie (2009) that X π(dx)φ(V (x)) < ∞
R
(or X π(dx)V (x) < ∞). This can be very useful when one aims to apply limit theorems developed for
β-mixing processes where moment conditions are typically assumed.

6

We close this section by noting that Condition Drift–SubG can also be used to obtain more general
ergodicity results than provided in Theorem 2. Without going into details we only mention that
Theorem 2.8 of Douc et al. (2004) and Theorem 1 of Meitz and Saikkonen (2019) show how a stronger
form of ergodicity, called (f, r)-ergodicity, can be established.

Example

To illustrate our results we consider the self-exciting threshold autoregressive (SETAR) model studied
by Chan et al. (1985). These authors analyzed the model
Xt = ϕ(j) + θ(j)Xt−1 + Wt (j),

Xt−1 ∈ (rj−1 , rj ],

(7)

where −∞ = r0 < · · · < rM = ∞ and for each j = 1, . . . , M , {Wt (j)} is an independent and identically
distributed mean zero sequence independent of {Wt (i)}, i 6= j, and with Wt (j) having a density that
is positive on the whole real line. They considered the following conditions
θ(1) < 1,

θ(M ) < 1,

θ(1)θ(M ) < 1,

(8a)

θ(1) = 1,

θ(M ) < 1,

0 < ϕ(1),

(8b)

θ(1) < 1,

θ(M ) = 1,

ϕ(M ) < 0,

(8c)

θ(1) = 1,

θ(M ) = 1,

ϕ(M ) < 0 < ϕ(1),

(8d)

θ(1) < 0,

θ(1)θ(M ) = 1,

ϕ(M ) + ϕ(1)θ(M ) > 0,

(8e)

and showed that the SETAR model is ergodic if and only if one of the conditions (8a)–(8e) holds (Chan
et al. 1985, Thm 2.1). Moreover, if E[|Wt (j)|] < ∞ for each j, they showed that condition (8a) ensures
geometric ergodicity (Chan et al. 1985, Thm 2.3). To our knowledge, in the cases (8b)–(8e) no results
regarding the rate of ergodicity have as yet appeared in the literature and our Theorem 4(b) below
indicates that geometric ergodicity may not always hold without stronger assumptions.3
We consider rates of ergodicity and β-mixing in case (8d) when the autoregressive coefficients θ(1)
and θ(M ) equal unity. For intuition, note that due to nonzero intercept terms ϕ(1) and ϕ(M ), both
the first and the last regimes exhibit nonstationary random walk type behavior with a drift. As the
intercept terms satisfy ϕ(M ) < 0 < ϕ(1), the drift is increasing in the first regime and decreasing
in the last regime. This feature prevents the process yt from exploding to (plus or minus) infinity,
thereby providing intuition why ergodicity can hold true. It is noteworthy that ergodicity is in no
way dependent of the behavior of the process in the middle regimes (2, . . . , M − 1) which can exhibit
stationary, random walk type (with or without drift), or even explosive behavior.
In their results, Chan et al. (1985) allow for regime dependent distributions for the error term
Wt (j). To obtain our results for the case (8d), we strengthen the assumptions on the error term and,
in particular, assume that the error distribution is the same in each regime (this stronger assumption is
needed to apply the results mentioned in the proof of Theorem 3 below, and relaxing it appears less than
straightforward). To compensate, we obtain results for a model more general than the SETAR model
(7) with (8d). Specifically, we formulate our results in terms of the general nonlinear autoregressive
3

Meyn and Tweedie (2009, Sec 11.4.3 and Sec B.2) also discuss the (geometric) ergodicity of the SETAR model (7),
reproducing the ergodicity result of Chan et al. (1985, Thm 2.1) as their Proposition 11.4.5. On their p. 541, Meyn and
Tweedie (2009) also state that (our additions in brackets) “in the interior of the parameter space [the union of (8a)–(8e)]
we are able to identify geometric ergodicity in Proposition 11.4.5 . . . the stronger form [geometric ergodicity] is actually
proved in that result” but no formal proof is given for this statement.

where the function g : R → R and the error term εt satisfy the following conditions:
(A1) g is a measurable function with the property |g(x)| → ∞ as |x| → ∞ and such that there exist
positive constants r and M0 such that
|g(x)| ≤ (1 − r/ |x|) |x|

for |x| ≥ M0

and sup|x|≤M0 |g(x)| < ∞;

(A2) {εt , t = 1, 2, . . .} is a sequence of independent and identically distributed mean zero random
variables that is independent of X0 and the distribution of ε1 has a (Lebesgue) density that is
bounded away from zero on compact subsets of R.
Model (9) with conditions A1 and A2 is a special case of models considered by Fort and Moulines
(2003, Sec 2.2), Douc et al. (2004, Sec 3.3), and Meitz and Saikkonen (2019, Secs 3–4). These authors
consider much more general models but for clarity of presentation we have simplified the model as
much as possible while still being able to obtain results for the SETAR model (7) with (8d) (the
first two of the abovementioned papers consider a multivariate version of (9), whereas the third one
considers a higher-order generalization of (9); the inequality constraint for the function g in condition

A1 is also more general in these papers where it is only required that |g(x)| ≤ 1 − r |x|−ρ |x| for some
0 < ρ ≤ 2).
The following Theorem establishes ergodicity and β-mixing results for model (9) with varying rates
of convergence. The proof (in the Appendix) makes use of results in Fort and Moulines (2003), Douc
et al. (2004), and Meitz and Saikkonen (2019) to obtain rates of ergodicity, as well as Theorems 1 and
2 above to obtain rates of β-mixing (only the subgeometric mixing results in parts (b) and (c) are
new).

r(n) = ns0−1 . Moreover, if the initial state X0 has distribution such that E [|X0 |s0 ] < ∞, then Xt
is also β-mixing and the mixing coefficients satisfy limn→∞ ns0−1 β(n) = 0.
Theorem 3 shows that there is a trade-off between rates of ergodicity and β-mixing and finiteness of


moments of the error term. The fastest geometric rate is obtained when E ez0 |ε1 | < ∞ (z0 > 0) so that
 
ε1 has finite moments of all orders and the slowest polynomial rate is obtained when only E ε21 < ∞.
R
As discussed after Theorem 2, we also have X π(dx)φ(V (x)) < ∞ so that there is a similar trade-off
between these convergence rates and finiteness of moments of the stationary distribution (expressions
of V and φ are available in the proof of Theorem 3).

Above it was mentioned that Fort and Moulines (2003), Douc et al. (2004), and Meitz and Saikkonen
(2019) consider (subgeometric) ergodicity of models more general than (9) with conditions (A1) and
(A2). Making use of our Theorems 1 and 2, subgeometric rates of β-mixing can straightforwardly be
obtained also for these more general models. We omit the details for brevity.
In a series of papers, Veretennikov and co-authors also considered the model (9) with function g

satisfying |g(x)| ≤ 1 − r |x|−ρ |x| for some 1 ≤ ρ ≤ 2. Using methods very different from ours, they
obtained results on subgeometric ergodicity and subgeometric rates for β-mixing coefficients. The cases
1 < ρ < 2 and ρ = 2 are considered in Veretennikov (2000), Klokov and Veretennikov (2004, 2005), and
Klokov (2007) and are shown to lead to subgeometric rates. For the case ρ = 1 relevant for the SETAR
example, these papers refer to Veretennikov (1988, 1991) and Veretennikov and Gulinskii (1990). A
result corresponding to our Theorem 3(a) can be found in Veretennikov and Gulinskii (1990, Thm 1)
but subgeometric rates, such as those in our Theorem 3(b) and (c), do not seem to be established in
the case ρ = 1.
We now specialize the results above to the SETAR model (7) with (8d). It is easy to see that this
P
model, with the function g in (9) defined as g(x) = M
j=1 [ϕ(j) + θ(j)x]1{x ∈ (rj−1 , rj ]} (with 1{·}
denoting the indicator function), satisfies the condition in A1. Namely, for x large enough and positive
we have |g(x)| = g(x) = x + ϕ(M ) = |x| − (−ϕ(M )) whereas for x small enough and negative we have
|g(x)| = −g(x) = −x−ϕ(1) = |x|−ϕ(1), so that the inequality in A1 holds for M0 > max{|r1 | , |rM −1 |}
and r = min{ϕ(1), −ϕ(M )} (and the supremum condition is obviously satisfied).
Part (a) of the next theorem simply restates the result of Theorem 3 for the SETAR model (7)
with (8d), whereas part (b) establishes that geometric ergodicity cannot hold under the weaker moment
assumptions of Theorem 3(b) and (c).
Theorem 4. Consider the SETAR model (7) with the parameters satisfying (8d) and the error terms
satisfying Wt (j) = εt (j = 1, . . . , M ) with εt as in (A2).
(a) Sufficient conditions for geometric, subexponential, and polynomial ergodicity and β-mixing of Xt
are as in parts (a), (b), and (c) of Theorem 3, respectively.


(b) If E ez0 |ε1 | = ∞ for all z0 > 0, then Xt is not geometrically ergodic.

Theorem 4(b) shows that for the SETAR model (7) with (8d), the subgeometric rates of Theorem
3(b) and (c) cannot be improved to a geometric rate unless stronger moment assumptions are made
regarding the error term. This result is obtained by making use of a necessary condition for geometric
ergodicity of certain specific type of Markov chains in Jarner and Tweedie (2003) (using their necessary
condition to obtain this result appears possible only in case (8d) out of (8a)–(8e)).

Conclusion

In this note we have shown that subgeometrically ergodic Markov chains are β-mixing with subgeometrically decaying mixing coefficients. Although this result is simple it should prove very useful in
obtaining rates of mixing in situations where geometric ergodicity can not be established. An illustration using the popular self-exciting threshold autoregressive model showed how our results can yield
new subgeometric rates of mixing.

Appendix
This Appendix contains the proofs of Theorems 2–4; proof of Theorem 1 is provided in the Supplementary Appendix. Proofs of Theorems 1 and 2 make use of the following handy inequality for the
β-mixing coefficients due to Liebscher (2005, Proposition 3). (Note that our Lemma 1 below includes
an additional factor of 12 compared to Liebscher’s Proposition 3; cf. our expression for β(n) in (4) and
his eqn. (27).) Again, ⌊k⌋ denotes the integer part of the real number k.
Lemma 1. Suppose Xt is a Markov chain with stationary distribution π and that the initial state X0
has distribution µ. Then

where n1 = ⌊n/2⌋.
In the proof below, notation Eµ [·] is used for the conditional expectation of a F0∞ -measurable
random variable conditioned on the initial state X0 with distribution µ. When conditioning is on
R
X0 = x the notation Ex [·] is used; these are connected via Eµ [·] = X µ(dx)Ex [·]. We also define the
concept of return time to a measurable set A as τA = inf {n ≥ 1 : Xn ∈ A}. For brevity, in the proof
we refer to Nummelin and Tuominen (1983) and Douc, Fort, Moulines, and Soulier (2004) as NT83
and DFMS04, respectively.
Proof of Theorem 2. First note that, due to the assumed irreducibility and aperiodicity, the petite
set C in Condition Drift–SubG is small (Meyn and Tweedie (2009, Thm 5.5.7)). We first show that
sup Ex

by Theorem 2.1 of Tuominen and Tweedie (1994) this implies the subgeometric ergodicity in (a) (for
related results implying (a), see also NT83, Theorem 2.7(i); Tweedie (1983), Theorem 1(iii); DFMS04
Proposition 2.5). It is shown in DFMS04 (Proposition 2.1 and Lemma 2.3) that Condition Drift–SubG
implies the existence of a sequence of drift functions Vk (x), k = 0, 1, 2, . . ., such that, for k ≥ 0,
E [Vk+1 (X1 ) | X 0 = x ] ≤ Vk (x) − rφ (k) + b̃rφ (k)1C (x),
where b̃ = brφ (1)(rφ (0))−2 (see their Proposition 2.1 and top of their page 1358) and rφ ∈ Λ (see
their Lemma 2.3). Applying Proposition 11.3.2 of Meyn and Tweedie (2009) with Zk = Vk (Xk ),
fk (x) = rφ (k), sk (x) = b̃rφ (k)1C (x), and stopping time τC we obtain (DFMS04, Proposition 2.2, also
states this conclusion; note also that by their eqn (2.2) we have V0 (x) ≤ V (x))

By the condition supx∈C V (x) < ∞ (in Condition Drift–SubG), we obtain (10). Now, Theorem
2.1 of Tuominen and Tweedie (1994) ensures that limn→∞ rφ (n) kP n (x ; ·) − π(·)k = 0 so that the
subgeometric ergodicity in (a) is established (note that as V0 (x) ≤ V (x) holds with V (x) assumed
everywhere finite, the set S(f, r) in Theorem 2.1 of Tuominen and Tweedie (1994) coincides with X so
that the aforementioned convergence holds for all x ∈ X).
R
To prove (b), suppose the initial state X0 has distribution µ such that X µ(dx)V (x) < ∞. We will
use Theorems 2.7(i,ii) and 2.2 of NT83, but first we obtain a property of the rate function rφ (z) (which is

Ex

well-known for members of Λ0 , but not for members of Λ). Recall that rφ (z) = (Hφ−1 )′ (z) = φ ◦ Hφ−1 (z)
so that rφ′ (z)/rφ (z) = φ′ ◦ Hφ−1 (z). As φ′ is nonincreasing (see Douc et al. (2004, first paragraph of
Sec 2.1)) and Hφ−1 is increasing, it follows that rφ′ (z)/rφ (z) = φ′ ◦ Hφ−1 (z) is nonincreasing. Therefore
Rx
also the function ln(rφ (x))/x = x1 0 (rφ′ (s)/rφ (s))ds (x > 0) is nonincreasing. Following the proof of
Lemma 1 in Stone and Wainger (1967) (which relies only on their property (iii) on their p. 326) yields
the desired property rφ (m + n) ≤ rφ (m)rφ (n) for all m, n > 0.

X µ(dx)V (x) < ∞ implies
Eµ [rφ (τC )] < ∞,

so that the condition in Theorem 2.7(ii) of NT83 is satisfied. Therefore, by Theorems 2.7(i,ii) and 2.2
of NT83,

Next consider part (d). In the stationary case (µ = π) the result limn→∞ rφ (n) π(dx) kP n (x ; ·) − π(·)k =

Thus (b) holds in the stationary case. Regarding part (c) in the stationary case, note from (5) that
R
now β(n) = π(dx) kP n (x ; ·) − πk, n = 1, 2, . . ., so that (b) and (c) are clearly equivalent (and hold
with the same rate rφ (n)).

The term in square brackets converges to zero as n → ∞ by parts (b) and (d) and, by assumption,

Proof of Theorem 3. The ergodicity results of parts (a) and (b) could be obtained using results
in Douc et al. (2004, Sec 3.3) and those in part (c) using results in Fort and Moulines (2003, Sec
2.2); for clarity of presentation, we will in all parts rely on the results in Meitz and Saikkonen (2019),
henceworth MS19. Model (9) with conditions (A1) and (A2) is a special case of the model considered
in MS19 (with p = ρ = 1 in that paper). Of the assumptions made in MS19, Assumption 1 holds due
11

to A1 and either Assumption 2(a) or 2(b) holds due to A2 and the moment conditions assumed in
parts (a)–(c) of Theorem 3. Therefore we can make use Theorems 2 and 3 in MS19 to obtain suitable
ergodicity results.
(a) In this case Assumption 2(a) of MS19 holds with κ0 = 1 and we apply their Theorem 2(ii). From
the proof of that theorem (Case p = 1) it can be seen that Condition Drift–G holds with V (x) = eb1 |x|
for some b1 ∈ (0, z0 ) which can be chosen as small as desired. From Theorem 2(ii) of MS19 we obtain
that Xt is geometrically ergodic with convergence rate r(n) = (ec )n (for some c > 0), that is, r(n) = r1n
for some r1 > 1. To obtain results on β-mixing, we next apply Theorem 1 of the present paper. If
the initial state X0 has distribution such that E[ez|X0 | ] < ∞ for some z > 0 (and noting that above b1
can be chosen small enough so that b1 ≤ z holds), then by Theorem 1 Xt is β-mixing and the mixing
coefficients satisfy, for some r3 > 1, limn→∞ r3n β(n) = 0.
(b) In this case Assumption 2(a) of MS19 holds with κ0 ∈ (0, 1) and we apply their Theorem
2(i). From the proof of that theorem (Case p = 1) it can be seen that Condition Drift–SubG holds
κ0
with V (x) = eb1 |x| (for some b1 ∈ (0, β0 ) which can be chosen as small as desired) and φ(v) =
c0 (v + v0 )(ln(v + v0 ))−α (for some c0 , v0 > 0 and α = 1/κ0 − 1). From Theorem 2(i) of MS19 we
κ
obtain that Xt is subexponentially ergodic with convergence rate r(n) = (ec )n 0 (for some c > 0). To
obtain results on β-mixing, we next apply Theorem 2 of the present paper. If the initial state X0 has
κ0
distribution such that E[ez|X0 | ] < ∞ for some z > 0 (and noting that above b1 can be chosen small
enough so that b1 ≤ z holds), then by Theorem 2 Xt is β-mixing and the mixing coefficients satisfy,
κ
for any c̃ ∈ (0, z2−κ0 ), limn→∞ r̃(n)β(n) = 0 with r̃(n) = (ec̃ )n 0 .
(c) In this case Assumption 2(b) of MS19 holds with either s0 = 2 or s0 ≥ 4 and we apply their
Theorem 3(ii) (in which exactly the cases s0 = 2 and s0 ≥ 4 are available). From the proof of that
theorem (the end of Step 4 and Case p = 1) it can be seen that Condition Drift–SubG holds with
V (x) = 1 + |x|s0 and φ(v) = cv α (for some c > 0 and α = 1 − 1/s0 ). From Theorem 3(ii) of MS19
we obtain that Xt is polynomially ergodic with convergence rate r(n) = n (s0 = 2) or r(n) = ns0 −1
(s0 ≥ 4). To obtain results on β-mixing, we next apply Theorem 2 of the present paper. If the initial
state X0 has distribution such that E [|X0 |s0 ] < ∞, then Xt is β-mixing and the mixing coefficients
satisfy limn→∞ nβ(n) = 0 (s0 = 2) or limn→∞ ns0 −1 β(n) = 0 (s0 ≥ 4).

Proof of Theorem 4. Part (a) follows immediately from Theorem 3 and the discussion preceding
it noting that the SETAR model (7) with (8d) satisfies the condition in A1. To prove (b), assume


that E ez0 |ε1 | = ∞ for all z0 > 0 but that Xt would be geometrically ergodic. We will use results
of Jarner and Tweedie (2003) to show that this leads to a contradiction. To this end, note that for
the SETAR model (7) with the parameters satisfying (8d) the function g in our equation (9) equals
P
g(x) = M
j=1 [ϕ(j) + θ(j)x]1{x ∈ (rj−1 , rj ]} which can be written as
P −1
g(x) = [ϕ(1) + x]1{x ≤ r1 } + [ϕ(M ) + x]1{rM −1 < x} + M
j=2 [ϕ(j) + θ(j)x]1{x ∈ (rj−1 , rj ]}
PM −1
= x + ϕ(1)1{x ≤ r1 } + ϕ(M )1{rM −1 < x} + j=2 [ϕ(j) + θ(j)x − x]1{x ∈ (rj−1 , rj ]}

or as g(x) = x + g̃(x) where g̃(x) is bounded. Also recall that it is assumed that the error terms satisfy
Wt (j) = εt (j = 1, . . . , M ) with εt as in (A2). These facts show that the SETAR model (7) with (8d)
can be expressed in the form of equation (3) in Jarner and Tweedie (2003) so that Xt is what Jarner
and Tweedie (2003) call a “random-walk-type Markov chain”. (Note also that this holds only in case
(8d) out of (8a)–(8e).) Theorem 2.2 of Jarner and Tweedie (2003) shows that a necessary condition for
the geometric ergodicity of a random-walk-type Markov chain Xt with stationary probability measure

12

R
π is that there exists a z > 0 such that R ez|x| π(dx) < ∞. This can be shown to be in contradiction


with our assumption that E ez0 |ε1 | = ∞ for all z0 > 0 as follows.
R z|x|
Suppose z > 0 is such that R e π(dx) < ∞ and assume that X0 , and hence also X1 , has
the stationary distribution π. Thus E[ez|X0 | ] < ∞ and E[ez|X1 | ] < ∞. As 0 < ezx ≤ ez|x| and
0 < e−zx ≤ ez|x| , it follows that E[ezX0 ], E[e−zX0 ], E[ezX1 ], and E[e−zX1 ] are all positive and finite.
As X1 = X0 + g̃(X0 ) + ε1 with X0 and ε1 independent, E[ezX1 ] = E[ezX0 ezg̃(X0 ) ]E[ezε1 ] (due to the
nonnegativity of the exponential function, this holds whether the expectations involved are finite or
equal +∞). As 0 < E[ezX0 ], E[ezX1 ] < ∞ and g̃(X0 ) is bounded this implies that 0 < E[ezε1 ] < ∞.
An analogous argument yields that 0 < E[e−zε1 ] < ∞. Finally, nonnegativity of the random variables
involved implies that E[ez|ε1 | ] = E[ezε1 1{ε1 ≥ 0} + e−zε1 1{ε1 < 0}] ≤ E[ezε1 ] + E[e−zε1 ] < ∞, yielding
a contradiction.

Proof of Theorem 1. For brevity, we refer to Nummelin and Tuominen (1982) and Meyn and
Tweedie (2009) as NT82 and MT09, respectively. We use Theorem 2.5(ii) of NT82 to prove (a).
To this end, first note that, due to the assumed irreducibility and aperiodicity, the petite set C in
Condition Drift–G is small (MT09, Theorem 5.5.7). We first show that, for some r > 1,
supx∈C Ex [r τC ] < ∞;
cf. Theorem 2.5(ii) of NT82. We proceed as in the proof of Theorem 15.2.5 in MT09 and, for the β in
Condition Drift–G, choose an r ∈ (1, (1 − β)−1 ) and set ε = r −1 − (1 − β) so that 0 < ε < β and ε is
the solution to r = (1 − β + ε)−1 . Now we may reorganize the drift condition as
E [V (X1 ) | X 0 = x ] ≤ r −1 V (x) − εV (x) + b1C (x),

x ∈ X.

Define Zk = r k V (Xk ), k = 0, 1, 2, . . ., so that E[Zk+1 | F0k ] = r k+1 E[V (Xk+1 ) | F0k ] and thus
E[Zk+1 | F0k ] ≤ r k+1 {r −1 V (Xk ) − εV (Xk ) + b1C (Xk )} = Zk − εr k+1 V (Xk ) + r k+1 b1C (Xk ).
Applying Proposition 11.3.2 of MT09 with fk (x) = εr k+1 V (x), sk (x) = br k+1 1C (x), and stopping time
τC we obtain

Theorem 2.5(iii) of NT82 it suffices to prove that Eµ [r ] < ∞. As Eµ [r ] = X µ(dx)Ex [r τC ], the
inequality Ex [r τC ] ≤ c3 V (x) + c4 obtained above implies Eµ [r τC ] < ∞ and hence the validity of (b)

R 2.1 of NT82 imply that limn→∞ r̃2 π(dx) kP (x ; ·) − π(·)k = 0 for some r̃2 > 1 (and

(c) in the stationary case, note from (5) that now β(n) = π(dx) kP n (x ; ·) − π(·)k, n = 1, 2, . . ., so
that (b) and (c) are clearly equivalent (and hold with the same rate r̃2 ).
To prove (c) in the general case, recall that n1 = ⌊n/2⌋ so that n/2 − 1 < n1 ≤ n/2, and note that
for any ρ > 1 and n ≥ 2, 1 = ρ1−n/2 ρn/2−1 < ρ1−n/2 ρn1 = ρ(ρ1/2 )−n ρn1 . Now choose r3 such that
