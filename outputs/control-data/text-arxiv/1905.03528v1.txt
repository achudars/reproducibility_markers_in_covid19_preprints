Abstract
The international Future Circular Collider (FCC) study [1]
aims at a design of p-p, e+ e− , e-p colliders to be built in a
new 100 km tunnel in the Geneva region. The e+ e− collider
(FCC-ee) has a centre of mass energy range between 90
(Z-pole) and 375 GeV (t t¯). To reach such unprecedented
energies and luminosities, the design of the interaction region is crucial. The crab-waist collision scheme [2] has
been chosen for the design and it will be compatible with all
beam energies. In this paper we will describe the machine
detector interface layout including the solenoid compensation scheme. We will describe how this layout fulfills all the
requirements set by the parameters table and by the physical
constraints. We will summarize the studies of the impact of
the synchrotron radiation, the analysis of trapped modes and
of the backgrounds induced by single beam and luminosity
effects giving an estimate of the losses in the interaction
region and in the detector.

LAYOUT AND DESIGN CRITERIA
The FCC-ee collider with 100 km circumference and a
wide range of beam energies, from 45.6 to 182.5 GeV, aims
at unprecedented levels of energies and luminosities. The
requirements at the collision point for the accelerator and
detector make the interaction region (IR) one of the most
challenging parts of the overall design, this region is named
machine detector interface (MDI). Table 1 summarizes the
most relevant beam parameters for the MDI design.
To reach the target luminosity of 2.3 × 1036 cm−2 s−1 at
the Z-pole the crab-waist collision scheme is a necessary
ingredient together with pushing the beam current to the
limit, obtainable with double rings. The baseline optics for
the FCC-ee double-ring collider is described in Ref. [3].
The main characteristics of the optics design are two interaction points (IPs) per ring, horizontal crossing angle of

30 mrad at the IP and the crab-waist scheme with local chromatic correction system. A so-called tapering of the magnets
scales all the magnetic fields with the local beam energy as
determined by the SR. This optics is being improved and
modified, for instance one of the most relevant modification
for the IR design is the reduction of βx∗ to 15 cm at the Z to
mitigate the coherent beam-beam instability [4]. Nominal
emittances are very small and especially in the vertical plane
the target value of y = 1 pm at the Z-pole poses stringent
requirements on misalignment tolerances as well as on coupling correction. The design restricts the total synchrotron
radiation (SR) power at 100 MW, thus the stored current per
beam varies from 1.4 A at Z to 5.4 mA at t t¯. Following the
LEP2 experience where the highest local critical energy was
72 keV for photons emitted 260 m from the IP [5] the FCCee optics design maintains critical energies from bending

magnets below 100 keV starting from 100 m from the IP;
critical energy from the first bend after the IP is higher, being 691 keV at t t¯. An asymmetric optics has been designed
to meet these goals on the critical energy. The asymmetry
allows each beam to come from the inner ring to the IP, to
be bent strongly after the IP and to be merged back close to
the opposite ring. Outside the IR, the FCC-ee and FCC-hh
trajectories are on the same footprint while an additional
tunnel is necessary for 1.2 km around the IP in order to allow
for the crab-waist collision scheme with large crossing angle.
The collider layout is shown in Figure 1 with the two beam
trajectories.
Figure 2 shows an expanded horizontal view for the region
±3 m from the IP. The free length between the interaction
point (IP) and the first final focus quadrupole (QC1) L∗ is
2.2 m. The IR is symmetric and the two beam pipes are
merged together at about 1 m from the IP and the distance
between the magnetic centres of the two QC1 for the two
beams is only few cm. In Figure 2 are also shown the main
components such as the first focusing quadrupole named
QC1 in yellow. The first element at about 1 m from the IP
is the luminosity counter, magenta in the plot and in red
and blue the instrumentation and cables, followed by the
compensating solenoid in light green and by the screening
solenoid starting at about 2 m and out of this plot. The High
Order Mode (HOM) absorber is in dark yellow, the Tungsten
shielding outside the vacuum pipe is in light blue. The detector solenoid, a cylinder with half-length 4 m and a diameter
of around 3.8 m, is outside this picture. Its peak value is 2 T.
To reduce multiple scattering effects in the luminosity monitor the vacuum chamber from ±0.9 m from the IP will be
made of Beryllium followed by a Copper vacuum chamber
throughout the final focus doublet. Synchrotron radiation
mask tips are also shown in the plot, they are placed in the

horizontal plane just in front of QC1 at 2.1 m from the IP to
intercept SR scattered particles. At the mask tips the horizontal aperture will be reduced from 15 mm to 12 mm. The
beam pipe will be at room temperature and water cooling
is foreseen throughout the IR, including inside the superconducting final focus quadrupoles. The compactness of
the MDI design, as result of the available space to host all
the necessary components is a challenge. An integration
study with an assembly concept is in progress, to study the
feasibility of this design. In addition to the elements shown
in Figure 2, also beam position monitors, flanges, bellows,
cryostat, vacuum pump need to be placed.

SOLENOID COMPENSATION SCHEME
The crab-waist collision scheme requires very small vertical beam sizes at the IP which implies the first final focus
quadrupole to be strong and close to the IP. It needs to be
so close to the IP that it is located inside the main detector solenoid. The additional ingredient for the crab-waist
scheme is the large crossing angle, which brings the two
beam trajectories to pass off-axis from the detector solenoid,
inducing also an increase of the vertical emittance. To handle
this unwanted effect, the detector solenoid field maximum is
set at 2 T and, on the other hand, a compensation solenoid is
foreseen as close as possible to the IP. A screening solenoid
is also needed to surround QC1 to avoid transverse beam coupling. A compact design is needed to leave a large physics
detector acceptance; the accelerator components are required
to stay below an angle of 100 mrad from the beam axis. This
design gives an overall emittance blow-up estimate of 0.3 pm
for two IPs at the Z-pole.
The stringent requirements of the final focus quadrupoles
can be satisfied by using canted-cosine-theta (CCT) technology. It is an iron-free design with crosstalk and edge
effect compensation, giving a field quality of better than
one unit for all multipoles. Dipole and skew quadrupole
correctors can be incorporated without increasing the length

of the magnetic system. The vertical emittance blow-up
due to residual magnetic field has been estimated with SAD,
finding an increase of 0.3 pm. A full mechanical and thermal engineering analysis has been performed as well. In
order to prove feasibility, a prototype of this design is under
construction at CERN.

IR TRAPPED MODES AND HIGH ORDER
MODE ABSORBER
The high beam currents produce electromagnetic waves in
the IR. The geometry of the beam pipe in the IR is as constant
and smooth as possible to avoid unwanted electromagnetic
trapped modes and heating problems. However, in the IR the
two beams may generate electromagnetic waves where the
vacuum chambers are combined into one near the collision
point [6]. This region is shown in Figure 3. The high order

and 2.91 kW power. This effect can be mitigated by HOM
absorbers, with slots oriented perpendicular to the HOM
electric field, allowing the mode field to easily propagate
through these slots and, at the same time, the beam field,
will not pass. Water cooled absorbers are above and below
the slots. They will be placed in the region where the two
beam pipes are split in two, and just after the luminosity
calorimeter, symmetrically from the IP. Figure 4 shows the
HOM absorbers design, which includes a water cooling
system to avoid heating.

modes (HOM) that interact with a beam particle may cause
local heating in the IR and typically their frequencies are
in the range of several GHz. Other electromagnetic waves,
excited by the beam, with a frequency above the cutoff will
travel away from the IR and may cause heating downstream
the ring. 3D calculations have been carried out using CST [7]
and HFSS [8] codes. The numerical simulations show that
there is a trapped mode with a frequency of 3.459 GHz

The large crossing angle together with the high beam energy may induce high SR in the IR and consequently into the
detector. We can state that the SR in the IR drives the layout
design. One of the most significant constraints is the requirement on the critical energy and power of the synchrotron
radiation generated upstream of the IR that may shine into
the detector. An additional constraint of the FCC-ee layout
is the compatibility with FCC-hh, which drives the infrastructure design. In order to combine the two requests of a
large crossing angle and the need to prevent high energy SR
fans from going into the IP, the IR optics have been designed
asymmetrically so that the incoming beam from both sides
comes from the inner ring and the outgoing beam exits to the
outer ring. In this way the outgoing beams are more strongly
bent than the incoming beams thereby lowering the SR energy from the incoming beams. Independent approaches are
used to evaluate the main source of the SR background in
the IR region coming from photons emitted by beam particles passing through the last bending magnets and by higher
amplitude particles in the final focus quadrupoles.
MDISim, SYNC_BKG and SYNRAD+ are used to evaluate the radiation critical energy, the SR fans and to design
the IR layout including masks, shieldings and the beam pipe.
MDISim [9] is a toolkit that combines existing standard tools
MAD-X [10], ROOT [11] and GEANT4 [12,13]. It reads the
MAD-X optics files, and uses its twiss output file to generate
the geometry and the magnetic field information in a format which can be directly imported in GEANT4 to perform
full tracking, including the generation of secondaries and
detailed modelling of the relevant processes. SYNC_BKG

traces beam macroparticles through sliced magnets and is a
modified version of a code developed at LBNL by Al Clark
(see ref. [14] for a detailed description of the two methods
and studies). SYNRAD+ [15] is used to perform a full simulation of the optical interaction, including reflection as well
as absorption, of the incident radiation with the beam pipe
material. It takes as input a geometry either from CAD or
STL format and the magnetic fields and it generates and
tracks SR photons starting from a given beam distribution.
To reduce SR backgrounds to tolerable limits the first criteria was to set a minimum distance for the bending magnets
from the IP and the maximum critical energy for incoming
beam. The synchrotron radiation flux reaching the detectors
can be further reduced by the combination of fixed and movable masks (collimators), as well as by optimizing surface
to reduce X-ray reflection. We foresee fixed mask tips at
2.1 m upstream of the IP, just in front of the first final focus
defocusing quadrupole, in order to intercept this radiation
fan and prevent the photons from directly striking the central
Be beam pipe. The next level of SR background then comes
from photons that strike near the tip of these masks, forward
scatter through the mask and then strike the central beam
pipe. At the top energy, most of these scattered photons
will penetrate the Be beam pipe and then cause backgrounds
in the detector. To reduce the effect of this SR source on
the experiment we propose to add a thin layer (of the order of 5 µm) of high-Z and high conductivity material such

as gold inside the Be beam pipe. This will also minimize
beam pipe heating from image charge currents. Table 2 is
a partial summary of the SR study with details about the
photon rate from the last soft bend upstream the IP for all
the running beam energies of the FCC-ee. In this study the
beam has been considered on-axis. No SR from dipoles or
quadrupoles hits directly the central beam pipe. Figure 5
shows the MDISim simulation for the SR generated in the
last bending magnets before the IP for the t_208_nosol optics for the top energy.The upper plot shows the origin of
these photons in the last bending magnets, as generated by
a beam starting at the red arrow. The lower plot shows the
energy distribution of the SR generated by the last bend
before the IP. These SR photons have been tracked into the
CLD and IDEA detectors, showing good agreement with
the SYNC_BKG simulation and showing the effectiveness
of the masking system. Figure 6 shows the hits per bunch
crossing with and without the Tungsten shielding.
As a next step more detailed simulations will be performed
on the SR, namely using more realistic optics including the
solenoidal field, including misalignments and realistic beam
distributions that may be slightly off-axis through the final
focus quadrupoles. In addition, presently GEANT4 doesn’t
include SR reflection and this effect will be studied as well.
SR collimators to intercept far bends are planned, as from
the LEP experience.

The deleterious effects of the background is a very important issue in the IR, detector and Machine Detector Interface designs. Beam induced backgrounds are scattering
processes leading to particles loss; inelastic beam-gas scattering has been simulated in the MDI region. Scattering
of the stored electrons and positrons with thermal photons
responsible for single beam particle losses at high energies
is also presently under study as from [16]. Luminosity backgrounds are produced at the collision point. Beamstrahlung
induced backgrounds have been studied in full simulation.
They generate backgrounds at the interaction point and are
mostly forward directed leaving the IR. Detailed background
studies are in progress to design the MDI region with proper
shieldings and collimators. The impact of machine beam

losses in the detector is being considered with full GEANT4
simulation for all the background sources. We briefly describe the study performed for these background sources.

Inelastic beam-gas scattering
A precise and effective methodology to perform a detailed
study of beam-gas scattering especially in the IR is provided
by MDISim. Beam gas induced background has been studied
in B-factories (PEP-II and KEKB) and in Super-B factories.
SuperKEKB is now starting to benchmark simulation studies
with real data [17].
The MDISim toolkit was used to generate the files needed
to perform a full GEANT4 simulation for the different beam
running energies. A constant beam pipe diameter of 70 mm
is considered throughout the ring except for the section from
-10 m to 10 m around the IP, shown in Figure 7. A constant
gas pressure of 10−7 Pa (or 10−9 mbar) is assumed for our
study.
The vacuum chamber in QC2 has a diameter of 40 mm, in
QC1 of 30 mm. The transition is considered in the simulation
with conical tapering from 30 mm to 40 mm as well as
from 40 mm to 70 mm (from QC2 to the arcs) in about one
meter of longitudinal distance. The beam pipe with magnetic
elements was reconstructed in the simulation from ±850 m
from the IP. Primary particles were generated starting at
-830 m from the IP, with realistic distributions in transverse
phase space, according to the optical parameters of the beam
in that point of the machine, and tracked for about 1000 m.
The simulations were performed for a residual gas consisting of N2 molecules. This represents a worst case, since the

actual residual gas in the beam pipe is expected to contain
only a certain fraction of this molecule. Table 3 gives the
expected particle loss rates both for the whole simulated
machine section and for the ± 20 m around the IP, for all the
four energy runs. We predict loss rates of roughly 100 MHz
per Ampere of beam current around the IR. As expected,
the highest loss rate is found for the Z-pole energy, essentially due to the high current configuration. IR losses are
concentrated in the regions where the vacuum chamber gets
smaller as the beam approaches the interaction point.
Beam-gas simulation results have been also weighted with
a realistic pressure profile evaluated with MolFlow [18] for
the fcc_213 optics at the top energy for about 600 m upstream
the IP. About 40% of increase in the expected losses has been
found.
First estimates of the background induced by these offenergy scattered particles in the luminosity calorimeter show
that the impact is at safe values, mostly thanks to the high-Z
shielding [19].

e+ e− pairs and γγ → hadrons
Beamstrahlung induced backgrounds have been simulated
with GuineaPig++ [20] namely coherent and incoherent pair
creation (CPC and IPC) and γγ → hadrons. This effect
has been simulated through the detector with full simulation
studies [21]. The Coherent Pair Creation (CPC) is strongly
focused on the forward direction and is negligible at FCC.
The Incoherent Pair Creation (IPC) is expected to be one
of the main sources of backgrounds. The impact of this
background source has been evaluated for the two FCC-ee
proposed detectors CLD (Clic Like Detector) and IDEA.
The CLD detector has been derived from CLIC detector
model and it has been optimized for FCC-ee experimental
conditions. CLD has a 2 T main solenoid field, with vertex
detector (VXD) with 3 double layers (barrel) and 4 discs
(barrel) and a Silicon tracker. The forward region has a cone
of 100 mrad reserved for accelerator use.
The IDEA detector has a vertex detector (MAPS), an
ultra-light draft chamber PID (DCH) and 2 T field.
The CLD maximum occupancy per bunch crossing for the
IPC and SR is low, being about ∼ 4 · 10−4 in the VXD for the
top energy and ∼ 1.6 · 10−4 in the tracker. The drift chamber
average occupancy results low as well, being ∼2.9 % for the
IPC and ∼0.2 % for the SR at the top.

Radiative Bhabha and Beamstrahlung loss map

Figure 7: Loss map in the IR.The loss peaks correspond to
the restriction of the vacuum chamber between the last drift
and final focus quadrupole QC2.

Radiative Bhaba and Beamstrahlung are luminosity background sources that can cause beam losses in the IR also due
to multiturn effects. GuineaPig++ [20] and BBBREM [22]
are used for the radiative Bhabha scattering generator, then
multiple turns particle tracking is performed with SAD [23]
to determine the IR loss maps. All the beam energies have
been considerd, from 45.6 GeV to to the top energy. At
45.6 GeV, the radiative Bhabhas are all lost up to about 70 m
downstream the first IP. At 175 GeV, the radiative Bhabhas are lost mainly in the first half of the ring, and high
energy particles that get eventually lost reach the second IP.

These particles loss distributions are then tracked into the
sub-detectors with a full GEANT4 simulation.
For the Beamstrahlung background, the beam-beam element was inserted at both IPs and tracking for a thousand
turns with full lattice was considered. Particle losses are
mainly concentrated 5 m around the IP in the vertical plane
and losses happen mainly in the first few turns. The impact
on detector performance is still under investigation although
we are expecting it not to be a major issue.

CONCLUSIONS
The FCC-ee Machine Detector Interface baseline conceptual design is ready. Many details have been studied
and work is in progress to develop more and more realistic
simulations. The solenoid compensation scheme foresees
a vertical emittance blow-up of 0.3 pm. Improvements and
alternative designs are on-going.
Beam induced and luminosity backgrounds have been
studied. Loss maps have been evaluated for inelastic beamgas scattering, and also for radiative Bhabha and beamstrahlung processes similar study is in progress. Luminosity
processes have been directly simulated in the detectors and
incoherent pair creation is the dominant effect but always at
safe values for both detector designs, CLD and IDEA. At
the present level of simulations we find that the SR masking results are very efficient for protecting the detectors and
maximum occupancy is under control and at safe values.
