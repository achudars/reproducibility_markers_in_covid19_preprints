Abstract
The ternary nitride CaZn2N2, composed only of earth-abundant elements, is a novel
semiconductor with a band gap of ~1.8 eV. First-principles calculations predict that
continuous Mg substitution at the Zn site will change the optical band gap in a wide
range from ~3.3 eV to ~1.9 eV for Ca(Mg1−xZnx)2N2 (x = 0–1). In this study, we
demonstrate that a solid-state reaction at ambient pressure and a high-pressure synthesis
at 5 GPa produce x = 0 and 0.12, and 0.12 < x  1 polycrystalline samples, respectively.
It is experimentally confirmed that the optical band gap can be continuously tuned from
~3.2 eV to ~1.8 eV, a range very close to that predicted by theory. Band-to-band
photoluminescence is observed at room temperature in the ultraviolet–red region
depending on x. A 2% Na doping at the Ca site of CaZn2N2 converts its highly resistive
state to a p-type conducting state. Particularly, the x = 0.50 sample exhibits intense
green emission with a peak at 2.45 eV (506 nm) without any other emission from
deep-level defects. These features meet the demands of the III-V group nitride and
arsenide/phosphide light-emitting semiconductors.

Rapid exploration of novel functional materials, composed only of earth-abundant
elements, has urgently been required for the future realization of a sustainable society.
Furthermore, such functional materials will lead to highly efficient energy conversion,
storage, and optoelectronic functionalities, such as electron transport and light emission,
and will be able to replace those materials currently being used, such as heavy, rare, and
toxic elements. To fulfill such a role, nitrides are promising candidates because they are
environmentally benign and remain unexplored compared with other materials systems,
such as oxides, chalcogenides, and pnictides (e.g., arsenides and phosphides). The
primary reason for such exploration results from the very high stability of a nitrogen
molecule with triple bonding compared with an oxygen molecule, chalcogen, or
pnictogen. N2 is therefore inactive even at high temperatures and under high pressures
without appropriate catalysts, which has led to the historical reluctance for the wider
exploration of nitrides compared with other compounds. This is the reason associated
with the requirements of more active nitrogen sources, such as ammonia and discharged
plasma, for novel nitride research, which themselves involve an immense amount of
time and effort to obtain. Thus, the currently commercialized nitride semiconductors
have mostly been limited to III-V group nitrides, GaN and its based alloys, with
appropriate band gaps intentionally tuned by solid-solution alloying techniques.
A light-emitting semiconductor with electron current injection is one of the key
components in practical optoelectronic devices. Although such components have been
commercially used, especially the III-V group alloy semiconductors, such as
(Ga,Al,In)N- and (Ga,Al,In)(As,P)-based materials, there remains a strong demand on
next-generation materials to exhibit a higher performance in terms of light brightness,
quantum efficiency, and color accuracy (i.e., emission bandwidth) [1]. However,
irrespective of the rapid growth in science and technology, light-emitting
semiconductors have a serious issue, so called the green gap problem, where the
emission quantum efficiency drastically decreases to ca. 20% in the particular
wavelength region around green light, even for the practical III-V group-based
light-emitting diodes [2]. This is mainly because of the large in-plane lattice mismatch
between In-based III-V alloys and single-crystal substrates, and the thermal instability
3

of In-based III-V nitride alloys. Thus, no highly efficient green-light emitting
semiconductor material has yet been realized for next-generation optoelectronic devices.
Therefore, it is necessary to explore and discover novel semiconductor materials, which
possibly have higher thermal stability and more compatible in-plane lattice mismatches
with III-V group nitrides, with a high quantum efficiency of light emission in the green
wavelength region (band gap = 2.3−2.5 eV, wavelength λ = 500−550 nm).
Recent progress of materials informatics, which combines comprehensive
first-principles calculations with experimental validations, has led to an acceleration in
the discoveries and/or predictions of novel ternary nitride semiconductors, such as
ZnSnN2 [3], Cu(Nb, Ta)N2 [4], LaWN3 [5], and CaZn2N2 [6], which all were previously
unknown. Therefore, materials informatics provides the possibility to overcome the
above-mentioned historical lack of exploration research of novel functional nitride
compounds. CaZn2N2 [6] was predicted through such an approach, and was proposed
with experimental validation as a novel promising optoelectronic functional nitride
semiconductor with a band gap of ~1.8 eV because of its small electron and hole
effective masses and direct transition-type energy band structure with a wide tunability
of its optical band gap of isomorphism nitrides by an alloying technique similar to III-V
group semiconductors. In Ref. [6], it was predicted that the band gaps could be widely
tuned from ~3.3 eV (for CaMg2N2, i.e., ultraviolet region) to ~1.6 eV (for SrZn2N2) and
~0.4 eV (for CaCd2N2) (i.e., red–infrared region) by solid-solution alloying at both the
Ca and Zn sites. This prediction indicates that this nitride is a promising host candidate
as a light-emitting semiconductor with high electron and hole transport properties in the
widely tunable ultraviolet–infrared wavelength region.
In this study, we focused on an earth-abundant Ca(Mg1−xZnx)2N2 (x = 0–1) complete
solid-solution nitride system because its band gap is controllable in the range of ~1.9 eV
to ~3.3 eV, following the computational prediction. Here we experimentally report the
validity of the prediction; that is, its band gap is tunable, the x = 0.50 sample exhibits an
intense green band-to-band emission without deep defect emission even at room
temperature and it can be doped to a p-type semiconductor by 2% Na doping at the Ca
site.

Structure and phase purity of Ca(Mg1−xZnx)2N2 (x = 0–1)
Figure 1(a) shows XRD patterns of polycrystalline Ca(Mg1−xZnx)2N2 (x = 0–1). The
results of Rietveld analysis are summarized in Fig. S1. We confirmed that the main
crystalline phase of all the samples had the same crystal structure as that of both end
members, CaMg2N2 [7] and CaZn2N2 [6], which consisted of a hexagonal structure of a
_

trigonal system with P3 m1 (No. 164); that is, successful fabrication of complete
solid-solution samples between x = 0 and 1. With an increase in x, the three diffraction

peaks of 1011 & 0111, 1012 & 0112, and 0003 of the Ca(Mg1−xZnx)2N2 main phase,
which are surrounded by dotted squares in Fig. 1(a), were continuously shifted to higher
2θ positions. Corresponding to this peak shift, both the a- and c-axis lattice parameters
shrank with increasing x [see Fig. 1(b)]. Compared with the calculated results by
first-principles structure relaxation [6], the absolute values of both end members (x = 0
and 1) and their variation trend with a change in x well-agreed with each other, although
the calculated values were slightly smaller than the observed values. Because the ionic
radii of Mg2+ and Zn2+ are almost the same, that is, 57 pm for Mg2+ and 60 pm for Zn2+
in the case where the coordination numbers = 4 [8], this variation trend with changing x
implied that the chemical bond between (Mg,Zn) and N was more covalent than ionic
because the covalent bond radius of Zn is slightly smaller than that of Mg. Note that a
small amount of BN was observed at 2θ = ~26.8°, which is indicated by vertical arrows
in Fig. 1(a). It was very difficult to completely remove this BN impurity in some
samples because a high pressure and a high temperature of 5.0 GPa and 1300 °C were
applied to the mixed-powder disks tightly contacted with capsules made of BN in the
high-pressure cells. However, this thin BN impurity located only around the outside
wall of the resulting disk samples, that is, the BN impurity did not diffuse inside the
bulk region of the samples. It should be noted that we observed that the phase stability
in air became strong with increasing x, that is, the x = 0 sample was unstable in air
because it decomposed into an amorphous-like hydroxide Ae(OH)2 (Ae = Mg, Ca) just
after air exposure, which is similar to the result reported on binary nitride precursors,
Mg3N2 and Ca3N2 [9]. In contrast, the x ≥ 0.50 samples were stable at room temperature
5

in air. In addition, the sample purity strongly depended on the x content. The volume
fraction of the main phase and impurity concentration for each x sample are summarized
in Fig. 1(c). Phase purity of the x = 0 sample was the best (~90%) among all the x
contents. Addition of Zn decreased the volume fraction of the main phase to 50–60% for
the x = 0.29–1 samples. Accordingly, the Mg3N2 impurity slightly increased up to ~20%
at x = 0.29, and the metal Zn impurity drastically increased at x ≥ 0.69.

Optical properties of Ca(Mg1−xZnx)2N2 (x = 0–1)
Figure 2 shows the optical properties of polycrystalline Ca(Mg1−xZnx)2N2 (x = 0–1)
at room temperature. With an increase in x, the absorption edge (nearly equal to the
optical band gap energy in this case) continuously shifted to the lower energy side from
~3.2 eV to ~1.8 eV [see black slope lines for (αhν/s)2 versus hν plots (data plotted by
solid lines) in Fig. 2(a)]. This continuously controllable band gap agreed well with the
calculated results [6] although all of them were slightly lower than the calculated values
[see Fig. 2(b)]. Accordingly, band-to-band PL originating from each band gap was
clearly observed even at room temperature [see open circles and vertical bars in Fig.
2(a)]. For the x = 0 sample, an additional large and broad emission band that peaked at
~2.6 eV was observed. The decay curve of this emission band was decomposed into 2
components, which were a relatively short component of <~30 ns and a longer
component of ~670 ns (see Fig. S2). Although the exact origins of these two lifetimes
were unclear, we propose possible origins: the former could be related to a small
amount (7 mol%) of the Mg3N2 impurity because the energy position is close to the
band gap of Mg3N2 (~2.5 eV) [10] and/or a recombination originating from defects in
Mg3N2 [11]. The latter could originate from defects such as donor–accepter pairs in
CaMg2N2 because the sample has a defective polycrystalline nature and the lifetime of
~670 ns is close to those of donor–acceptor pairs with a short donor–acceptor distance
<< 10 nm of conventional semiconductors [12]. For the x = 0.29 sample, we confirmed
that the emission lifetime of an emitting band that peaked at ~2.8 eV was ~7 ns (see Fig.
7

S3), which is comparable to the pulse width of the excitation laser we used, that is, the
exact lifetime could not be estimated by this experiment. However, the information of a
short lifetime was sufficient to assign it to a band-to-band transition. Therefore, we
concluded that the ~2.8 eV PL band originates from a band-to-band emission for x =
0.29. In addition, an emission band that peaked at a ~3.1 eV was observed. This PL
originated from the BN impurity [13], because we also observed the same emission
band from the x = 0.50 and 0.69 samples when we set the observation wavelength
region of the spectrometer around this region (data not shown) and a small amount of
BN impurity was commonly observed in these 3 samples in their XRD patterns [see
vertical arrows at 2θ = ~26.8° in Fig. 1(a)]. Consequently, based on the above
experimental optical properties at room temperature, we continuously and widely tuned
the optical band gaps and emission bands from ~3.2 eV (λ = ca. 390 nm, ultraviolet
region) to ~1.8 eV (ca. 670 nm, red region) in complete solid-solution samples of
Ca(Mg1−xZnx)2N2 (x = 0–1). In particular, it should be noted that the x = 0.50 sample
exhibited intense green light emission that peaked at ~506 nm (= ~2.45 eV) even at
room temperature.

In this study, we focused on light-emitting semiconductors in the green color region
(i.e., band gap = 2.3−2.5 eV, λ = 500−550 nm). Thus, we examined the PL properties of
the x = 0.50 sample in more detail because the PL band was located in the appropriate
wavelength region for green emission. Figure 3(a) shows the temperature dependence of
the PL spectra. We observed three emission bands, A–C. Band A originated from a small
amount of a BN impurity [13], as discussed in the former section. Band B was assigned
to the band-to-band transition because the emission peak position at 300 K was almost
the same as that of the absorption edge observed in Fig. 2(a). Band C arose from
deep-level defects and/or impurity phases because the energy deference between B and
C was ~200 meV at 20 K, although the origin was unclear because the emission peak
energy of band C did not depend on the measurement temperature and almost
disappeared at ≥150 K. Because a similar temperature dependence has been reported for
a Mg acceptor in GaN:Mg [14], band C could have similar origins, that is, point defects
trapped at doped-impurity sites (e.g., band-to-impurity transitions). Owing to the
band-to-band recombination, the energy of band B shifted to the lower energy side with
increasing temperature from 2.49 eV at 20 K to 2.45 eV at 300 K [see Fig. 3(b)]. At 75–
100 K, an anomalous PL peak shift from 2.48 eV to 2.49 eV (i.e., a blue shift with
increasing temperature) was observed. The possible origin of this anomalous shift was
as a result of a transition from bound excitons to free excitons, as observed in
room-temperature-exciton (i.e., electron – hole pairs stable at room temperature)
materials, such as ZnO [15] and LaCuOS [16]; whereas details of its origin should be
discussed using more high-resolution and continuous wave-excited PL measurements on
higher quality samples, such as single crystals and epitaxial films. The PL intensity was
decreased by approximately one order of magnitude from 20 K to 300 K, owing to
temperature deactivation [see Fig. 3(b)]. However, the emission observed in the x = 0.50
sample shown in Fig. 2(a) was also clearly observed at room temperature. Next, we
examined the emission lifetime of bands B and C. The estimated lifetimes at 20 K were
~2 ns for band B and ~250 ns for band C (see Fig. S4). Because the pulse width of the
10

excitation Nd:YAG we used was ~7 ns, the lifetime of band B could not be exactly
estimated. This result suggested that the emission band B originated from bound/free
excitons because the lifetime was sufficiently shorter than several nanoseconds. The
relatively fast lifetime of ~250 ns for band C was roughly consistent with the above
proposed origin, that is, point defects trapped at doped-impurity sites because the
lifetime of Mg acceptor in GaN:Mg has been reported to be on the subnanosecond order
[17]. However, these above assignments are tentative and speculated possibilities.

Electronic transport properties of Na 2%-doped (Ca1–yNay)(Mg1−xZnx)2N2 (x =
0.67 and y = 0.02)
Although Na-undoped (Ca1–yNay)(Mg1−xZnx)2N2 (x = 0–1 and y = 0) samples were
all too highly resistive to measure the electrical conductivity (much higher than 106 Ω
cm), 2% Na-doping exhibited measurable conductivity. Figure 4(a) shows an
_

_

enlargement of the strongest 1011 & 0111 peak region (2θ = ca. 33°) in the XRD
pattern of the Na 2%-doped polycrystalline sample. The Rietveld analysis result is
shown in Fig. S5. The main phase purity was low, 25%, while those of Zn and Mg3N2
impurities that might possibly exhibit electrical conduction were also small, 8% and
15%, respectively. Thus, it was considered that such small amounts of possibly
electrical conductive impurities should not dominate the electrical conduction of the
sample. Irrespective of almost the same ionic radii of Ca2+ and Na+, the XRD peak
slightly shifted to the higher 2θ side by Na doping, which indicated its lattice shrinkage.
This variation trend of lattice parameters was attributed to the participation of a covalent
nature in the bonding between (Ca,Na) and N, as was also observed in Fig. 1(b).
Although the undoped sample with x ≥ 0.5 was chemically stable, the Na-doped sample
with x ≥ 0.5 was quite sensitive to air exposure. The temperature dependence of ρ
exhibited a thermally activated-type behavior, which implied that metallic zinc did not
contribute to the electronic conduction. The inset of Fig. 4(b) is the result of a
thermoelectric power measurement at room temperature. These data indicate p-type
electrical conduction with a positive Seebeck coefficient of +2.3 µV/K. However, the
activation energy estimated using an Arrhenius plot (see Fig. S6) was ~330 meV, which
suggested that relatively deep acceptor levels formed within the energy band gap upon
Na doping. We also tried n-type carrier doping by adding La or Y to the Ca site, but no
enhancement of electrical conduction was observed. These results indicated that we
could successfully obtain a p-type semiconducting sample with an appropriate band gap
near green emission by selecting proper x and Na doping amounts.

In summary, we synthesized Ca(Mg1−xZnx)2N2 (x = 0–1) by conventional solid-state
reaction for x = 0 and 0.12 and high-pressure synthesis at 5 GPa for 0.12 < x  1 in
Ca(Mg1−xZnx)2N2. It was experimentally validated that the optical band gaps can be
14

tuned continuously from ~3.2 eV to ~1.8 eV. Owing to the direct transition-type band
structure, ultraviolet–red band-to-band photoluminescence was clearly observed in the
entire x = 0–1 region even at room temperature. p-type electrical conduction was also
demonstrated by 2% Na doping at the Ca site. Especially, the sample with x = 0.50
exhibited an intense green band-to-band emission, which is strongly demanded in III-V
group light-emitting semiconductors.

Experimental Methods
Three polycrystalline binary nitrides, calcium nitride (Ca3N2), magnesium nitride
(Mg3N2), and zinc nitride (Zn3N2), were used as starting precursors for undoped (Ca1–
yNay)(Mg1−xZnx)2N2

(x = 0–1, y = 0, i.e., not hole carrier-doped) polycrystalline samples.

Ca3N2 powder was synthesized by heating Ca metal (purity: 99.99%), which was put on
a rolled Fe foil in a silica-glass tube, at 900 °C for 10 h under a N2 gas flow atmosphere
(G1 grade, flow rate of N2 gas = 100 mL/min.). For Mg3N2 powder, Mg metal (purity:
99.5%) was reacted with N2 gas in almost the same manner as that of the Ca3N2
precursor. All these processes, including heating, were performed in an Ar-filled glove
box (oxygen concentration ≤ 0.0 ppm, dew point < –100 °C) without exposure to air
because both the binary nitrides are sensitive to air; that is, the silica-glass tube furnace
was directly connected to the glove box. Such a direct nitridization process of alkali
earth metals under N2 atmosphere is similar with previous reports [18, 19]. The Zn3N2
powder we used was a commercially available product (purity: 99%). Colors of the
precursor powders were rubric black for Ca3N2, dark chrome-yellow for Mg3N2, and
gray for Zn3N2, which were roughly consistent with their reported optical band gaps of
~1.5 eV for Ca3N2 [20], ~2.5 eV for Mg3N2 [10], and ~0.85 eV for Zn3N2 [21]. Ca3N2
and Mg3N2 powders were synthesized just before mixing and heating experiments for
syntheses of Ca(Mg1−xZnx)2N2 (x = 0–1) and were completely used within two days as it
was difficult to store them without degradation even in the glove box for a long time,
such as ~1 week.
To synthesize polycrystalline Ca(Mg1−xZnx)2N2 (x = 0 and 0.12), a conventional
solid-state reaction was employed. Stoichiometric mixtures of Ca3N2, Mg3N2, and
15

Zn3N2 precursor powders with the molar ratios of Ca3N2:Mg3N2:Zn3N2 = 1:2(1−x):2x
were pressed into disks (size: diameter of ~6 mm and height of ~7 mm) in the glove box,
which were sealed in Ar-filled stainless tubes, followed by a heating process at 1050 °C
for 24 h, as has previously been reported for CaMg2N2 [7].
In contrast, to synthesize Zn-substituted nitrides with higher x, Ca(Mg1−xZnx)2N2
(0.12 < x  1) solid-solutions, we used a belt-type high-pressure apparatus [22] to
realize a high nitrogen chemical potential during the chemical reaction between
precursors in the high-pressure cells. Stoichiometric mixtures of each binary precursor
were pressed into disks, which were put into BN capsules, followed by setting up in
high-pressure cells made of NaCl (+10 wt% ZrO2) with a graphite heater. We also
examined Na doping at the Ca site for hole-carrier doping because the ionic radius of
Na is close to that of Ca (100 pm for Ca2+ and 102 pm for Na+ for the case where their
coordination numbers = 6) [8], whereas the atomic/covalent bond radius of Na is
slightly smaller than that of Ca. A commercially available NaN3 reagent powder
(99.5%) was used as a sodium source. As-received NaN3 was thermally annealed in a
vacuum of ~10–2 Pa at 250 °C for 6 h to purify before mixing. We mixed the precursor
powders so as to be (Ca1–yNay)(Mg1−xZnx)2N2 (x = 0.67 and y = 0.02).
The pressure and heating temperature of the high-pressure cells, including BN
capsules and pressed disks in the glove box for the synthesis of undoped and Na-doped
Ca(Mg1−xZnx)2N2 (0.12 < x  1), were commonly increased to 5.0 GPa and 1300 °C,
respectively, and they were then kept for 30 minutes. The final size of the
high-pressure-synthesized samples was a diameter of ~5.5 mm and thickness of ~2 mm
(after polishing). More details of the experimental procedure and apparatus of the
high-pressure synthesis is reported in Ref. [6].
Crystal structures of the samples, such as crystalline phases and lattice parameters,
were determined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) with the Bragg-Brentano
geometry with a Cu Kα radiation source at room temperature, where an Ar-filled
O-ring-sealed sample holder was used because the Mg-rich samples (x < 0.5) were
sensitive to air. The lattice parameters of the main phase were determined by the Pawley
method using the TOPAS ver. 4.2 program (Karlsruhe, Germany: Bruker AXS GmbH).
16

Rietveld analysis was performed to estimate the volume fraction of each crystalline
phase observed and x in Ca(Mg1−xZnx)2N2 [i.e., crystallographic site occupancy of the
(Mg,Zn) site] using the TOPAS program after initially determining the lattice
parameters by the Pawley method because it was difficult to exactly distinguish the
main phase of Ca(Mg1−xZnx)2N2 from some impurity phases, such as Zn and Mg3N2, by
conventional spectroscopic quantitative techniques, such as X-ray fluorescence
spectroscopy and electron probe microanalysis.
Diffuse reflectance (R) spectra were measured at room temperature with a
spectrophotometer in the wavelength (λ) region of 200–2400 nm. The obtained R
spectra were converted using the Kubelka−Munk function (1–R)2/(2R) = α/s [23], where
α and s denote the optical absorption coefficient and scattering factor, respectively, to
obtain the quasi-optical absorption spectra. The optical band gap of each sample was
estimated from plots of (αhν/s)2 versus hν, where h and ν are the Planck constant and
frequency, respectively, because the band structures of both end members (i.e., x = 0 and
1) have been reported to be of the direct transition type [6]. Photoluminescence (PL)
spectra and emission lifetimes at 20–300 K were attained with a CCD camera and a
spectrometer under excitation by 3ω of a Nd:YAG laser (λ = 355 nm, pulse width = ~7
ns); whereas only for the CaMg2N2 (i.e., x = 1) sample, 4ω of the Nd:YAG (λ = 266 nm)
was used because of the widest bandgap in Ca(Mg1−xZnx)2N2 (x = 0–1).
Electronic transport properties were measured only for the (Ca1–yNay)(Mg1−xZnx)2N2
(x = 0.67 and y = 0.02) sample because the electrical resistivity of the other undoped
samples (i.e., x = 0–1 and y = 0) was too high to measure their transport properties. We
initially confirmed the electrical conduction with a conventional electric tester in the
glove box because the Na-doped sample was air sensitive. The temperature dependence
of the electrical resistivity, and thermoelectric power (ΔV) as a function of difference in
temperature (ΔT) at room temperature (i.e., the Seebeck effect) were measured with a
physical property measurement system. For these electrical measurements, we
transferred the Na-doped sample from the glove box to the measuring system within ~1
min together with surface protection using commercially available Apiezon grease to
disturb the degradation.
