DISTRIBUTION OF BOUNDARY POINTS OF EXPANSION AND
APPLICATION TO THE LONELY RUNNER CONJECTURE
T. AGAMA
Abstract. In this paper we study the distribution of boundary points of expansion. As an application, we say something about the lonely runner problem.
We show that given k runners Si round a unit circular track with the condition
that at some time ||Si − Si+1 || = ||Si+1 − Si+2 || for all i = 1, 2 . . . , k − 2, then
at that time we have
D(n)π
||Si+1 − Si || >
k−1
for all i = 1, . . . , k − 1 and where D(n) > 0 is a constant depending on the
degree of a certain polynomial of degree n. In particular, we show that given at
most eight Si (i = 1, 2, . . . , 8) runners running round a unit circular track with
distinct constant speed and the additional condition ||Si − Si+1 || = ||Si+1 −
Si+2 || for all 1 ≤ i ≤ 6 at some time s > 1, then at that time their mutual
distance must satisfy the lower bound

for some constant C > 0 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ 7.

1. Introduction
The lonely runner conjecture is the assertion that given n runners round a unit
circle with constant distinct speed and starting at a common time and place, there
must exist a time for which their mutual distances should be at least n1 . The
conjecture has been verified for many special cases. For instance in [2], it has been
shown that the conjecture hold for six runners. It is also shown in [1] for at most
seven runners. In this paper, by studying the distribution of boundary points of an
expansion, we verify this conjecture in it’s crude form with an extra conditioning
for at most eight runners. We obtain a conditional result of this conjecture by
showing that:

for all i = 1, . . . , k − 1 and where D(n) > 0 is a constant depending on the degree
of a certain polynomial of degree n.

3. Distribution of boundary points of expansion
In this section we study the distribution of the boundary points of any phase of
expansion. We first introduce the notion of integration of polynomials along the
boundaries of various phases of expansion, which we then use as a main tool. We
launch the following definition in that regard.
Definition 3.1. Let f (x) = cn xn + cn−1 xn−1 + · · · + c1 x + c0 be a polynomial of
degree n, then we call the tuple
Sf = (cn xn , cn−1 xn−1 , . . . , c1 x + c0 )
= (g1 (x), g2 (x), . . . , gn (x))

the tuple representation of f . By the integral of f (x) along the boundary of the
mth phase expansion, we mean the formal integral

and where Se = (1, 1, . . . , 1) is the unit tuple, and O∆Si ,Si+1 and OSe are the
position vectors of ∆Si ,Si+1 and Se , respectively, with Si = (a1 , a2 , . . . , an ) and
Si+1 = (b1 , b2 , . . . , bn ).
Remark 3.2. It is in practice very difficult to ascertain the local distribution of
boundary points of expansion. However, we can show that if we shrink the space
bounded by the boundary of an expansion, then points on the boundary should be
closely packed in some sense. We use the notion of integration along boundaries as
a black box.
Theorem 3.3. Let f (x) := cn xn + cn−1 xn−1 + · · · + c1 x + c0 be a polynomial of
degree n. Then

closest pair of boundary points, the inequality

Remark 3.4. Theorem 3.3 in the affirmative tells us that we can use the area as a
yardstick to determine the distribution of points on the boundary of any phase of
expansion.

4. Rotation of the boundary of expansion
In this section we introduce the concept of rotation of the boundary of an expansion.
Definition 4.1. Let (γ −1 ◦ β ◦ γ ◦ ∇)m (Sj ) be an expansion with corresponding
boundary B m (Sj ). Then we say the map ∨ is a rotation of the boundary B m (Sj ) if
∨ : B m (Sj ) −→ B m (Sj ).

We say an expansion admits a rotation if there exist such a map. In other words,
we say the map ∨ induces a rotation on the expansion. We say the boundary is
stable under rotation if || ∨ (Sa )|| ≈ ||Sa || for Sa ∈ B m (Sj ). Otherwise we say it is
unstable.
Remark 4.2. Next we prove a result that indicates that boundary points of an
expansion whose boundary occupies a small enough region must be stable.
Proposition 4.1. Let f (x) := cn xn +· · ·+c1 x+c0 ∈ R[x], a polynomial with degree
n ≥ 3. Let (γ −1 ◦ β ◦ γ ◦ ∇)m (Sf ) be an expansion with corresponding boundary
B m (Sf ) admits a rotation ∨. If
Z

Bm (Sf )
m<n

then the boundary B m (Sf ) is stable.

f (t)dt < 1

6

T. AGAMA

Proof. Let f (x) := cn xn + · · · + c1 x + c0 ∈ R[x], a polynomial with degree n ≥ 3.
Let (γ −1 ◦ β ◦ γ ◦ ∇)m (Sf ) be an expansion with corresponding boundary B m (Sf )
admits a rotation ∨. Suppose also that
Z

f (t)dt < 1

m

B (Sf )
m<n

then it follows from Theorem 3.3 that ||Si || ≈ ||Si+1 || for all 1 ≤ i ≤ #B m (Sf ) − 1
with Si , Si+1 ∈ B m (Sf ). It follows that for the rotation ∨ : B m (Sf ) −→ B m (Sf ),
we have that for any Si ∈ B m (Sf ), then
∨(Si ) = Sk
for some Sk ∈ B m . It follows that || ∨ (Si )|| = ||Sk || ≈ ||Si ||, thereby ending the
proof.

Definition 4.3. Let (γ −1 ◦ β ◦ γ ◦ ∇)m (Sj ) be an expansion with corresponding
boundary B m (Sj ). Then we say the map ∨ is a rotation of the boundary B m (Sj )
with frequency s if
∨s : B m (Sj ) −→ B m (Sj ),
where ∨s = ∨ ◦ ∨ ◦ · · · ◦ ∨ is the s-fold rotation on the boundary of expansion.
Remark 4.4. It is important to recognize that rotation with frequency s is the time
for which points on the boundary of expansion are allowed to be in motion by an
induced rotation.
Proposition 4.2. Let (γ −1 ◦ β ◦ γ ◦ ∇)m (Sj ) be an expansion with corresponding
boundary B m (Sj ). Then any permutation
σ : B m (Sj ) −→ B m (Sj )
where σ(Si ) = Sσ(i) for 1 ≤ i ≤ #B m (Sj ) for Si ∈ B m (Sj ) is a rotation of the
boundary of expansion.

5. Spherical defoliation of the boundary of expansion
Definition 5.1. Let B m (Sf ) and Sk−1 be the boundary of the mth expansion and
the k dimensional unit sphere, respectively. Then by the spherical defoliation of
the boundary of expansion, we mean the map
Λ : B m (Sf ) −→ Sk−1
such that for any Sa ∈ B m (Sf ), then we have
Λ(Sa ) =

Sa

6. Application to the Lonely runner conjecture
Theorem 6.1. Given k runners Si round a unit circular track with the condition
that at some time ||Si − Si+1 || = ||Si+1 − Si+2 || for all i = 1, 2 . . . , k − 2, then at
that time we have
D(n)π
||Si+1 − Si || >
k−1
for all i = 1, . . . , k − 1 and where D(n) > 0 is a constant depending on the degree
of a certain polynomial of degree n.
Proof. First assume any polynomial g(x) := b1 xn + · · · + b1 x + b0 for some choice
of n so that the size of the boundary of expansion #B m (Sg ) = k for some m < n.
The under the condition ||Si − Si+1 || = ||Si+1 − Si+2 || for all i = 1, 2 . . . , k − 2 at
some time, we set

and apply the s-fold rotation ∨ = ∨ ◦ ∨ ◦ · · · ◦ ∨ on the boundary B m (Sg ). Then
by Proposition 4.1 points on this boundary are now unstable for time s > 1 with
each moving at distinct speeds and satisfying the lower bound
C(n)π
k−1
for all i = 1, . . . , k−1 and where D(n) > 0 is a constant depending on the degree of a
certain polynomial of degree n. Since some point on the boundary of expansion may
not be a point on the unit circle, we apply the spherical defoliation Λ : B m (Sg ) −→
Sk , and we obtain
||Si+1 − Si || >

D(n)π

for all i = 1, . . . , k − 1 and where D(n) > 0 is a constant depending on the degree

Lemma 6.2. Let f (x) := c3 x3 + c2 x2 + c1 x + c0 be a polynomial of degree 3 and
suppose ||Si − Si+1 || = ||Si+1 − Si+2 || for all 1 ≤ i ≤ 6. Then

that
