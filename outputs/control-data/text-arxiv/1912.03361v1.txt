An algebraic structure, Quotient Algebra Partition or QAP, is introduced in a serial of
articles. The structure QAP is universal to Lie Algebras and enables algorithmic and
exhaustive Cartan decompositions. The first episode draws the simplest form of the
structure in terms of the spinor representation.

Introduction

This serial of articles give a thorough exposition for the framework called Quotient Algebra
Partition (QAP). Originally discerned in 2005 [1] in the motivation of constructing Cartan
decompositions [9–11], a QAP is a partition over a Lie algebra that consists of abelian subspaces closed under commutation relations. Lie algebras and Lie groups are commonly known
by their algebraic features from structures and geometric properties as applied to symmetric
spaces [2,3]. While, the QAP structure particularly manifests their combinatorial traits [4–6].
As an opening discussion slightly amended from the original version [1], the 1st episode
provides a simplest picture for the QAP structure in terms of the spinor representation.
The structure of this form permits algorithmic and exhaustive Cartan decompositions of
type AI. In the successive episode [4], the framework QAP is rephrased in the language
of the s-representation for spinor generators, cf. Appendix B. Thanks to this language, a
QAP of the simplest form is established under a minimum number of conditions governed
by a bi-subalgebra of rank zero, i.e., a Cartan subalgebra. Besides, all Cartan subalgebras
of su(N ) are classified and generated shell by shell through the process of the subalgebra
extension. Thirdly [5], a quotient algebra partition undergoes further partitions generated by
bi-subalgebras of higher ranks. The refined versions of quotient algebra partitions of higher
ranks allow not only Cartan decompositions of type AI but also decompositions of types AII
and AIII, resorting to an operation called the tri-addition. A special type of transformations,
referred to as s-rotations, are introduced to attain the computational universality. It shows
mappings preserving the QAP structure are composed of spinor-to-spinor s-rotations. In the
final episode [6], two kinds of partitions on unitary Lie algebras are created by nonabelian
bi-subalgebras, which reveals a partition duality. By applying appropriate coset rules, the
two partitions return to a quotient algebra partition when the generating bi-subalgebra is
abelian. Of significance is the universality of the QAP structure to classical and exceptional
Lie algebras. A newly unveiled application of this framework [7] asserts that every action

admits fault tolerance in every quantum code. This may pave a way for scalable fault tolerance
quantum computation.
Although most of examinations focus on su(N ) of a nodal dimension, i.e., N = 2p , the
structure QAP is universally existing in an arbitrary Lie algebra of finite dimension. In this
episode, the structure QAP is portrayed in the simplest form mainly in the spinor representation. Within a QAP, the algebra is partitioned into a certain number of abelian subspaces, and
these subspaces form an algebra under an abelian and binary operation. Structured binarily
and combinatorially, the framework QAP algorithmically produces exhaustive decompositions
over a Lie algebra level by level, and thus also resulted factorizations for the associated group
actions. The presentation offers two views of a QAP structure, i.e., the quotient algebra and
co-quotient algebra.

Conjugate Partition

To have a quick access to the structure of a quotient algebra, the exposition will begin with
examples for the Lie algebras su(6) and su(8). Although the structure is representation
independent, simply for convenience, the generators of these algebras are written in tensor
products of the Pauli and Gell-Mann matrices.
The first step of introducing the quotient-algebra structure to the Lie algebra su(N ) is to
select a center subalgebra and let it be denoted by A. In this preliminary episode, only the
basic forms, quotient algebras of rank zero, will be concerned. To construct a such quotient
algebra, an arbitrary Cartan subalgebra, a maximal abelian subalgebra, is taken from the
algebra su(N ). With this choice of the center subalgebra, more abelian modules will be
discerned. An abelian subalgebra of 7 elements as listed in the central column of Fig. D.1 is
an example of the center subalgebra for su(8), A = {σ3 ⊗ I ⊗ I, I ⊗ σ3 ⊗ I, I ⊗ I ⊗ σ3 , σ3 ⊗
σ3 ⊗ I, σ3 ⊗ I ⊗ σ3 , I ⊗ σ3 ⊗ σ3 , σ3 ⊗ σ3 ⊗ σ3 }. It may be easiest to form a Cartan subalgebra
within a Lie algebra by collecting all its diagonal generators. The second step is to assign an
arbitrary generator s ∈ su(N ) − A as a seed, for example I ⊗ I ⊗ σ1 at the left hand side of the
center subalgebra in Fig. D.1(a). Four other generators are produced at the right hand side
by calculating the commutator of the seed with all elements of the center subalgebra, i.e.,
mapping the seed by the adjoint representation adA (s) = [s, A]. Then in the reverse step,
three more generators are added to the LHS column as shown in Fig. D.1(b) after calculating
the commutator [g0 , A], where g0 is an arbitrary generator in the RHS column.
A nice property is observed that both the modules of these two columns are abelian. Let
W1 and Ŵ1 denote the vector subspaces respectively spanned by the generators in the LHS
and RHS columns and each of them is considered the conjugate of the other, noting that
[W1 , Ŵ1 ] ⊂ A. Via the same procedure, more conjugate pairs of abelian subspaces {Wi , Ŵi }
are produced by taking a seed outside the center subalgebra and the existing conjugate pairs,
from {W1 , Ŵ1 } to {Wi−1 , Ŵi−1 }, and calculating the required commutators of the adjoint
representation adA . The exposition will temporarily be based on the current version of the
algorithm primitive.
Halting while no any seed generator being left, this procedure leads to a partition of the
original algebra, for instance the one given in Fig. D.2. As stated in the following Lemma,
there always exists a such conjugate partition for the Lie algebra su(N ).
Lemma 1 With an abelian subspace A suitably taken as the center subalgebra, the Lie

Zheng-Yao Su

algebra su(N ) admits the conjugate partition consisting of A and a finite number q of
conjugate pairs {Wi , Ŵi }, 1 ≤ i ≤ q, namely,
su(N ) = A ⊕ W1 ⊕ Ŵ1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Wi ⊕ Ŵi ⊕ · · · ⊕ Wq ⊕ Ŵq ,

(2.1)

where the subspaces Wi and Ŵi are abelian and obey the commutation relations, ∀ 1 ≤ i ≤ q,
[Wi , A] ⊂ Ŵi , [Ŵi , A] ⊂ Wi and [Wi , Ŵi ] ⊂ A.

(2.2)

This lemma also provides the definition of the conjugate partition that is generally associated
to quotient algebras of any ranks [4–6]. The proof of this partition for quotient algebras of
rank zero will be given in Theorem 1.

Quotient Algebra

In addition to the conjugate partition composed of a certain number of abelian subspaces,
of great interest is an algebraic structure embedded among these subspaces. Let a conjugate
partition of su(8) illustrated in Fig. D.2 be taken as an example. It is easy to verify the fact
that the commutator of any two elements from two subspaces of the partition must be either
{0} or included in a third subspace. This closure feature reveals the algebraic structure of
thematic attention, the quotient algebra.
Definition 1 For a conjugate partition generated by the center subalgebra A and comprising
a number q of conjugate pairs of abelian subspaces {Wi , Ŵi }, 1 ≤ i ≤ q, the subspaces form a
quotient algebra, denoted as a multiplet of partition {Q(A; q)} ≡ {A, Wi , Ŵi ; 1 ≤ i ≤ q}, if
the condition of closure is satisfied under the operation of the commutator: that is, there
always exists a unique third pair {Wk , Ŵk } for two arbitrary conjugate pairs {Wi , Ŵi } and
{Wj , Ŵj }, 1 ≤ k 6= i, j ≤ q, such that
[Wi , Wj ] ⊂ Ŵk , [Wi , Ŵj ] ⊂ Wk and [Ŵi , Ŵj ] ⊂ Ŵk ;

(3.1)

here the center subalgebra A acts as the identity of the operation within a conjugate pair, i.e.,
∀ 1 ≤ i ≤ q,
[Wi , A] ⊂ Ŵi , [Ŵi , A] ⊂ Wi and [Wi , Ŵi ] ⊂ A.
(3.2)
In brief, a quotient algebra is a partition of a given algebra where each partitioned subspace
is abelian and considered an individual module, and more importantly these modules are
closed under the operation of the commutator following the condition of closure. The number
of conjugate pairs is essential, for which indicates the rank of a quotient algebra. Yet, the
notation of the algebra allows the abbreviation {Q(A)} when the number specification is no
needed. There exists the quotient-algebra structure not only in su(2p ) but also in the Lie
algebra su(N ) of dimension N 6= 2p . As shown in Fig. D.3 similarly, the center subalgebra of
5 diagonal operators {I ⊗ σ3 , µ3 ⊗ I, µ8 ⊗ I, µ3 ⊗ σ3 , µ8 ⊗ σ3 } generates a quotient algebra in
su(6). Being a generating set of su(3), the generators µj , j = 1, 2, . . . , 8, denote the Gell-Mann
matrices, ref. Appendix A. In this quotient algebra, the subspaces Wi or Ŵi are spanned by
either 2 or 3 generators, in contrast to equally 4 in those of su(8). To construct a conjugate
partition and the corresponding quotient algebra, the center subalgebra is not restricted to a

4

subspace of diagonal generators. Figures D.4 and D.5 present instances of quotient algebras
for su(8) and su(6) acquired by taking other choices of center subalgebras. These instances
foretell the following theorems.
Main Theorem Every Lie algebra su(N ) admits structures of quotient and co-quotient
algebras up to rank r0 and its quotient and co-quotient algebras of rank r are respectively
isomorphic to those of su(2p ), where 2p−1 < N ≤ 2p , 0 ≤ r ≤ r0 ≤ p, and the dimension has
the factorization N = 2r0 N ′ with N ′ being odd.
Similar to a quotient algebra, a co-quotient algebra [5] is an algebraic structure realizing
the conjugate partition and the condition of closure as prescribed in Definition 1, which
instead is generated by a center subalgebra quite different from that for a quotient algebra.
The systematic exposition of quotient and co-quotient algebras requires the language of the
s-representation, ref. Appendix B. Phrased in the s-representation, these structures can
be classified into different “ranks” according to the kinds of their center subalgebras. The
complete treatment of quotient and co-quotient algebras shall be given in the 2nd and the
3rd episodes [4, 5], thus to which the proof of Main Theorem is postponed. At this beginning
stage, only the simplest scenario, the quotient algebra of rank zero generated by a Cartan
subalgebra, will be asserted.
Theorem 1 Every Cartan subalgebra A of the Lie algebra su(N ), 2p−1 < N ≤ 2p , can
generate a quotient algebra of rank zero {Q(A; 2p − 1)}.

Proof. To prove this theorem along with Lemma 1, the Lie algebra su(2p ) of dimension
N = 2p will be considered first, and then followed by the extension to general dimensions
as stated in Corollary 1. Rather than constructing the general form of a rank-zero quotient
algebra with resort to the s-representation as in the 2nd episode [4], a straightforward proof
in a simpler language will be presented here.
For every Cartan subalgebra A ∈ su(N ), there exists a transformation U ∈ SU (N ) to map
A to its intrinsic coordinate or eigenspace, where all elements of the subalgebra A are
simultaneously diagonalized. Let the Cartan subalgebra consisting of only diagonal operators
be regarded as the intrinsic Cartan subalgebra or the intrinsic center subalgebra and
written in the reserved notation C. In other words, owing to the connectedness of the group,
there exists U ∈ SU (N ) for every A ∈ su(N ), such that U AU † = C. Thus, it suffices to give
the exposition mainly in the intrinsic coordinate.
λ-Representation. The vector space of the intrinsic center subalgebra C of su(4) for example is spanned by the 3 diagonal operators, I ⊗ σ3 = diag{1, −1, 1, −1}, σ3 ⊗ σ3 = diag{1, −1,
−1, 1} and σ3 ⊗ I = diag{1, 1, −1, −1}, or equivalently by another set of 3 independent operators diag{1, −1, 0, 0}, diag{1, 0, −1, 0} and diag{1, 0, 0, −1}. In general, it is of convenience to
have a generating set of the intrinsic center subalgebra C of the Lie algebra su(N ) formed by
a number N − 1 of N × N diagonal operators: diag{1, −1, 0, · · · , 0}, diag{1, 0, −1, 0, · · · , 0},
. . . and diag{1, 0, · · · , 0, −1}. According to the algorithm primitive, calculating the commutators of a seed generator with C, or mapping the seed by the adjoint representation adC ,
produces the generators in the conjugate subspace. To examine this operation, the so-called
λ-representation, an extension of the well-known Gell-Mann matrices, is employed. In this

Zheng-Yao Su

representation, a λ-generator λij is an off-diagonal N × N matrix and plays the role of σ1 ,
where the only two nonzero entries the (i, j)-th and (j, i)-th are both written to be 1. Another
λ-generator λ̂ij , being the conjugate of λij and an off-diagonal N × N matrix too, takes the
role of σ2 and has nonzero values only at the (i, j)-th and the (j, i)-th entries that are assigned
with −i and i respectively. More details of this representation are referred to Appendix A.
According to Eqs. A.1-A.3, the adjoint representation adC leaves a λij or a λ̂ij invariant
within the pair. The λ-generators may well act as building blocks to form the conjugate pairs
of abelian subspaces. In terms of these generators, some combinatorial traits will be read in
the following construction of conjugate partitions and quotient algebras.
Binary Partitioning. A set of the λ-generators in an appropriate grouping can serve as a
basis for an abelian subspace of a quotient algebra. Such a grouping implies a specific partition
on the subscripts of the λ-generators. Since two of these generators commute as long as there
having no repetition in their subscripts, a maximal abelian subspace in su(N ) − C is spanned
by a set of N/2 elements: {λij or λ̂kl : the subscripts of the generators are assigned according
to a partition of the integers from 1 to N , i, j, k, l = 1, 2, . . . , N }. For instance, two sets of
4 generators {λ15 , λ̂26 , λ37 , λ̂48 } and {λ16 , λ̂28 , λ̂37 , λ̂45 } in su(8) respectively form an abelian
subalgebra. Although both the partitions of generator subscripts lead to creating an abelian
subspace, only the former kind fits the further use to hold a quotient algebra. Generators
of conventional types bring in the clue. Take one spinor generator σ3 ⊗ I ⊗ σ1 ∈ su(8) for
example, which reads as λ12 + λ34 − λ56 − λ78 in the λ-representation and is a vector in the
subspace W1 spanned by the 4 generators λ12 , λ34 , λ56 , and λ78 . By exercising the algorithm
primitive described above, the 4 independent generators of the conjugate subspace Ŵ1 are
produced from the commutator [σ3 ⊗ I ⊗ σ1 , C]. Conversely, the commutator [ĝ, C], ĝ being
any one of the 4 conjugate generators in Ŵ1 , fills in the rest 3 independent generators of the
subspace W1 . These two elementary steps are in practice implementing Eqs. A.1 and A.2. A
critical observation is noted that the subscripts of the λ-generators so produced in the same
conjugate pair share a common binary pattern of partitioning, here particularly termed as
the binary partitioning. For the subspace W1 , the subscripts of the λ-generators have the
common pattern of bit-wise addition i′ + j ′ = 001, here i′ = i − 1 and j ′ = j − 1 being
written in their binary expressions. Since the mapping adC leaves a λ-generator invariant
in its conjugate pair, all generators belonging to the same pair should retain the identical
subscript pattern of the binary partitioning. That is, the binary partitioning is an invariant
under the adjoint representation adC . It is legitimate to encode such a subscript pattern into
a binary string and attach the string to the conjugate pair. The subspaces W1 and Ŵ1 are
hence redenoted as W001 and Ŵ001 .
Conjugate Partition. The continued step is to arbitrarily pick a spinor generator as a
seed outside this conjugate pair and the center subalgebra. The example σ3 ⊗ σ1 ⊗ σ1 =
λ14 + λ23 − λ58 − λ67 exhibits another pattern of the binary partitioning i′ + j ′ = 011 with
the subscripts of the λ-generators i′ = i − 1 and j ′ = j − 1 in their binary expressions. Then
the conjugate pair W011 and Ŵ011 are obtained by calculating the commutators guided in
the algorithm primitive. Likewise, via this procedure the abelian subspaces, associated to the
strings from 001 to 111, appear pair by pair, ref. Fig. D.6. These 7 conjugate pairs along

6

with the center subalgebra C form a conjugate partition of su(8). This procedure is generally
applicable to the Lie algebra su(2p ), of which every spinor generator in the λ-representation
carries a certain subscript pattern of the binary partitioning. Let a binary string of p digits
encode a subscript pattern. Say associated to the string ζ ∈ Z2p , an arbitrary spinor generator
gζ ∈ su(2p ) is taken as a seed outside C and the existing conjugate pairs. With the aid of
Eqs. A.1 and A.2, a new conjugate pair {Wζ , Ŵζ } is created through the mappings [gζ , C] and
[ĝζ , C], where ĝζ is a generator yielded from the former commutator. Such a step is recursively
applied until no generator is left and a total number 2p − 1 of conjugate pairs attached
with distinct binary-partitioning strings all have appeared. Therefore, a conjugate partition,
Eq. 2.1, completes in the Lie algebra su(2p ). The invariance of the binary partitioning within
a conjugate pair as formulated in Eq. 2.2 is a straightforward implication of Eqs. A.1-A.3.
Quotient Algebra. Most importantly, the binary partitioning encodes the structure of a
quotient algebra. A such structure becomes manifest as being articulated in the phrasing of
the binary partitioning. For three abelian subspaces associated to three binary-partitioning
strings of p digits ζ, η and ξ, the condition Eq. 3.1 reads as [Wζ , Wη ] ⊂ Ŵξ , [Wζ , Ŵη ] ⊂ Wξ ,
and [Ŵζ , Ŵη ] ⊂ Ŵξ . According to Eqs. A.4-A.6, the commutator of two λ-generators in su(2p )
with the subscripts (i, j) and (j, k), or (k, j), contributes a λ-generator of the subscript (i, k);
here i, j and k are three distinct integers. Suppose that the subscript (i, j) is associated to
the string ζ and (j, k) to η, and thus there have the identities of bit-wise additions i′ + j ′ = ζ
and j ′ + k ′ = η for i′ = i − 1, j ′ = j − 1 and k ′ = k − 1 in their binary expressions. The string
associated to the resulted subscript (i, k) is then coerced to be ζ + η, for j ′ + j ′ = 0. In this
phrasing, the intrinsic Cartan subalgebra is in nature an abelian subspace attached with the
identity string, the string of all zeros, i.e., C = W0 = Ŵ0 . It reaches the conclusion that the
condition of closure Eq. 3.1 as well as the conjugate partition Eq. 3.2 can be pronounced in
one elegant formulation, ζ, η ∈ Z2p ,
[Wζ , Wη ] ⊂ Ŵζ+η , [Wζ , Ŵη ] ⊂ Wζ+η , and [Ŵζ , Ŵη ] ⊂ Ŵζ+η .

(3.3)

This formulation hints a feature of binary combinatorics in quotient algebras. An example
for su(8) is illustrated in Fig. D.8.
The intrinsic quotient algebra of rank zero {Q(C; 2p − 1)} given by, actually “partitioned
by,” C ⊂ su(2p ) is therefore validated. The quotient algebra of rank zero {Q(A)} given by
another Cartan subalgebra A is always transformable to the former one by a unitary action
U ∈ SU (2p ). Namely, the two quotient algebras are equivalent under a conjugation mapping
{Q(A)} = U † {Q(C)}U provided U AU † = C.
Subscript Multiplication. Apparently there are many more options of conjugate partitions. To fulfil the condition of Lemma 1 in su(2p ), the binary partitioning is not a unique
choice of the subscript arrangement. As aforementioned, a conjugate partition is achieved
as long as the λ-generators in an abelian subspace of every conjugate pair have no repetition in their subscripts. However, to further realize the structure of a quotient algebra, the
consistence in the subscripts, i.e., following the binary partitioning or its equivalence, is necessary. Take an abelian subspace V ⊂ su(8) for example that is spanned by the 4 generators,

Zheng-Yao Su

V = span{λ16 , λ25 , λ37 .λ48 } ⊂ W100 ∪ W101 . This grouping of subscripts is considered inconsistent due to bearing two different strings of the binary partitioning. As a consequence, a
half of the 8 generators produced from the commutator [V, W011 ] fall in the subspace W110
and another half in W111 . Specifically, the inconsistence causes the partition to violate the
condition of closure. It will be shown immediately that, to accommodate in su(2p ) the structure of the intrinsic quotient algebra of rank zero given by C ⊂ su(2p ), the subscripts of the
λ-generators are obliged to follow the binary partitioning or its permutations.
For this purpose, the following demonstration is to reexamine how the condition of closure
is satisfied under the operation of a commutator for two abelian subspaces in the intrinsic
quotient algebra. Thanks to Eqs. A.4-A.6, a commutator operation can be reduced to as
simple as a subscript multiplication of two integer pairs: (i, j) ∗ (j, k) = (i, k), where i, j and k
are the three different subscripts of the two λ-generators in a commutator and an integer pair
here has no order, i.e., (i, j) = (j, i). The other multiplications are corresponding to the case
either {0} for two commuting generators, or the inclusion in C for two generators belonging
to one conjugate pair. The subscript table of su(4) is rendered as follows,
(1, 2) (3, 4)
(1, 3) (2, 4)
(1, 4) (2, 3)
which represents the 3 conjugate pairs of a conjugate partition. Simply displaying the conjugate pairs of a conjugate partition, a subscript table is orderless in the sense that there is no
order for integer pairs in one row and no order either for these rows in the table. Since the
multiplication of two integer pairs from any two rows always falls in the rest row, this table
represents a quotient algebra in su(4) too. An easy check leads to the fact that all permutations of the 4 integers make the table unchanged, noting the orderless of a subscript table. It
indicates that the binary partitioning is invariant with respect to the subscript permutation
as the dimension N = 4.
Now proceed to the subscript table of su(8),
(1, 2)
(1, 3)

(3, 7)

(7, 8)
(6, 8)

(4, 8).

There are drawn only 4 rows of integer pairs in the table to represent 4 conjugate pairs. For
according to the condition of closure, the other 3 rows of integer pairs are already decided by
these 4 rows. This may be called the pre-decision rule that, for a quotient algebra of su(2p ),
the other 2p −p−1 conjugate pairs are determined by a number p of independent pairs. Before
the interaction row {(1, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (4, 8)} being taken into account, any permutations
respectively exercised in the integer sets {1, 2, 3, 4} and {5, 6, 7, 8} are permitted, for these
two sets are disjoint and have no “interaction.” Yet, some inconsistency may be introduced
to the pairs while a such partial permutation is carried out along with the consideration of
the interaction row . An example is as the table,
(1, 2) (3, 4) (5, 7) (6, 8)
(1, 3) (2, 4) (5, 6) (7, 8)

(1, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (4, 8).
where the integers 6 and 7 are interchanged in the first 3 rows, the beginning rows, but no
corresponding permutation is followed in the 4th row, the interaction row. The order of a
row here is referring to the display order in the table and has no meaning to the conjugate
partition. This table is literally equivalent to
(1, 2)
(1, 3)

(4, 8).

where the original integer pairs, complying with the binary partitioning, are preserved in
the first 3 rows, and the interchange of integers 6 and 7 instead takes place in the 4th row.
The condition of closure is violated when the interaction row is multiplied by either one of
two beginning rows, the 1st and the 2nd, in the table. This instance is no atypical. Any
permutation of integers in the beginning rows can be transferred to as a permutation in the
interaction row once the binary partitioning is recovered in the former rows. Thus, whether
the condition of closure is met is depending on if the integer pairs are consistently arranged
in the interaction row.
A recursive argument is developed for the general assertion. The subscript table of the Lie
algebra su(2p ) can be prepared by, in addition to one interaction row, gluing the two tables of
su(2p−1 ) in the way that each of the 2p−1 − 1 beginning rows is acquired by collecting integer
pairs of the identical binary partitioning from the two tables. The integer pairs in one table
are written in those from the 1st set of 2p−1 integers s1 = {1, 2, . . . , 2p−1 }, and the pairs in the
other table are in integers from the 2nd set s2 = {2p−1 + 1, 2p−1 + 2, . . . , 2p }. The interaction
row consists of 2p−1 integer pairs (x, y) where x ∈ s1 and y ∈ s2 . Suppose that there exist
in the interaction row at least two integer pairs (a, b) and (c, d), a, c ∈ s1 and b, d ∈ s2 ,
inconsistent in the binary patterns of their associated strings, i.e., ηa + ηb 6= ηc + ηd with
ηa , . . . , ηd respectively denoting a − 1, . . . , d − 1 in their binary expressions. There should have
one beginning row that contains the two integer pairs (b, d) and (a′ , c), leaving the integer a′ to
be decided. They share the identical pattern ηb +ηd = ηa′ +ηc , for these two integer pairs are in
one beginning row and cling to the binary partitioning. The multiplication of these two rows
of integer pairs produces, among the others, the pairs (a, d) and (a′ , d). Then, a contradiction
occurs ηa′ = ηb + ηc + ηd 6= ηa , which fails the condition of closure. The implication is hence
derived that, to keep closed the multiplication of integer pairs, the interaction row must be
obedient to the binary partition if the beginning rows have been so. As leaned earlier, the
binary partitioning is fully respected by su(4), whose subscript table is invariant under all
integer permutations. The recursive argument thus starts with su(8), p = 3, and let its
conjugate pairs form according to the binary partitioning. Immediately it asserts that, for
the Lie algebra su(2p ), only the conjugate partition following the binary partitioning admits
the structure of the intrinsic quotient algebra of rank zero {Q(C; 2p − 1)}.
Even so, this assertion does not deny a global permutation that applies the same permutation of integers to every row of the table. For in a such circumstance still the binary
partitioning is fulfilled and integers are permuted simply as labelling indices. It concludes

Zheng-Yao Su

the sufficient and necessary criterion that, up to a permutation on the subscripts of the
λ-generators, the conjugate partition admitting the quotient algebra {Q(C)} in su(2p ) is
unique, the one conforming to the binary partitioning. That is to say, the complete set of
conjugate partitions carrying {Q(C)} is obtained by exhaustively permuting the subscripts of
λ-generators initiated by the binary partitioning. However, these variants are composed of
generators in superpositions of noncommuting spinors and of no current interest.
Algebra Isomorphism. As the dimension N is not a power of 2, the Lie algebra su(N )
admits as well the structures of conjugate partitions and rank-zero quotient algebras. The
reason can be read from an example of a conjugate partition for su(6) as in Fig. D.7. Written in
the λ-representation similarly, this partition comprises 7 conjugate pairs of abelian subspaces
in addition to a center subalgebra of 5 generators. An explicit distinction between Figs. D.6
and D.7 lies in the change that all the generators with subscripts larger than the dimension
N = 6, i.e., with 7 or 8 here, are removed from the latter. As suggested earlier, the generating
set {d1l : l = 2, 3, . . . , 8} is a convenient choice for the intrinsic center subalgebra of su(8). It
has the interpretation that the (i, j)-th entry of an generator is responsible for contributing
to transformations on the plane spanned over the i-th and the j-th dimensions. There are no
the 7th and the 8th dimensions in su(6) and transformations involving these two dimensions
are forbidden. A generator with either one of these two subscripts then ought to be set to 0
or simply removed from the partition. As a result, all the rest of 8 × 8 matrices of generators
originally for su(8) are nil in the 7th and the 8th rows and columns. Undergoing the removal
of the 7th and the 8th rows and columns, a number 35 of remaining generators of 6×6 matrices
suffice for the formation of the algebra su(6). Conversely speaking, with the recoverage of the
7th and the 8th rows and columns despite being nil, these generators support an embedding
of su(6) in the space of su(8).
On the other hand, since only those with subscripts greater than the dimension N = 6
are removed, all the λ-generators of subscripts less than or equal to the dimension survive
the removing. Belonging to an abelian subspace of the intrinsic quotient algebra of su(8)
respectively, either in a conjugate pair or in the center subalgebra, these survived generators
sustain the original conjugate-partition structure and realize the condition of closure all the
same. An isomorphism of the quotient algebra is therefore guaranteed for su(6) and su(8).
This removing process is applicable to every Lie algebra su(N ) for 2p−1 < N < 2p : Let
the λ-generators λij , λ̂ij ∈ su(2p ) and those in C = Span{d1l , l = 2, 3, . . . , 2p } ⊂ su(2p ) be
removed from the intrinsic quotient algebra {Q(C; 2p − 1)} of su(2p ) iff l, i or j > N . As a
consequence, the Lie algebra su(N ) is spanned by a number N 2 −1 of the remaining generators;
from the (N + 1)-th to the 2p -th rows and columns in the matrices of these generators are nil
and allow a further removal. Still all the generators with subscripts ranging from 1 to N reside
in the conjugate pairs and the center subalgebra respectively, which are structurally inherited
from the quotient algebra {Q(C; 2p − 1)}. The relations amongst these abelian subspaces of
removed versions, Eqs. 3.1-3.3, are preserved accordingly. Also, it is plain to verify that none
of the subspaces of {Q(C; 2p − 1)} reduce to null due to the removing. The following corollary
is hence asserted. 
Unitary Lie algebras of certain dimensions enjoy the isomorphism of quotient algebras.

Quotient Algebra Partition and Cartan Decomposition for su(N ) I

Corollary 1 The quotient algebra of rank zero of the Lie algebra su(N ), 2p−1 < N < 2p , is
isomorphic to that of su(2p ).
The concept of the binary partition is essential to characterizing the structure of a quotient
algebra and is heavily engaged in the argument above, which however will become natural
as being translated into the s-representation [4]. Appendix B may be consulted for a quick
glance. Not only performed as a basic tool in those of rank zero, also the removing process is
applicable to quotient algebras of higher ranks. The extension leading to similar isomorphisms
in higher ranks will be elaborated in the proof of Lemma 19 preceding to Main Theorem in [5].

Scheme Implementation

With the validation of Theorem 1, the construction of a quotient algebra is complied into an
algorithm as follows.
Quotient Algebra {Q(A)} Construction for su(N ), 2p−1 < N ≤ 2p ,
with a center subalgebra A ⊂ su(N )
The step of preparation:
Find the unitary transformation U that has A diagonalized, i.e., mapping A to the intrinsic
center subalgebra C by U AU † = C.
The 1st step:
Choose a generator g11 ∈
/ C as a seed and calculate the commutator [g11 , C], which produces
a set of a finite number r̂1 of abelian generators ĝ1 = {ĝ11 , ĝ12 , · · · , ĝ1r̂1 }, and then let the
subspace Ŵ1 =< ĝ1 > be spanned by ĝ1 ; in the reverse step, the commutator [ĝ1i , C], ĝ1i ∈ ĝ1 ,
adds the other r1 − 1 abelian generators to the set g1 = {g11 , g12 , · · · , g1r1 }, which forms the
conjugate subspace W1 =< g1 >.
.........
The l-th step:
Sl−1
With a generator gl1 ∈ su(N )− C 1 {Wi , Ŵi } taken as the l-th seed, the commutator [gl1 , C]
yields a set of abelian generators ĝl = {ĝl1 , ĝl2 , · · · , ĝlr̂l } and let the subspace Ŵl =< ĝl >
be spanned by the set ĝl ; in the reverse step, the commutator [ĝli , C], ĝli ∈ ĝl , contributes
another abelian set gl = {gl1 , gl2 , · · · , glrl }, which forms the conjugate subspace Wl =< gl >;
Divide or merge the conjugate pair(s) into refined pair(s) according to the condition of closure
whenever necessary.
.........
End when no generator remains.
The construction of the intrinsic quotient algebra {Q(C)} completes;
Map {Q(C)} to the quotient algebra {Q(A)} by the transformation {Q(A)} = U † {Q(C)}U .
Algorithm.

The step of merging commuting conjugate pairs is necessary on occasion when a conjugate
pair is created in part through calculating the commutator of the center subalgebra and a
seed generator. Simple examples are available in constructing quotient algebras of su(4) in the
λ-representation. By Eqs. A.1 and A.2, the commutator [g, C] yields only a single generator
ĝ, with g being a λij or a λ̂ij and C being the intrinsic center subalgebra of su(4). There are
two options of merging, for instance, either {λ12 , λ34 } ∪ {λ̂12 , λ̂34 } or {λ12 , λ̂34 } ∪ {λ̂12 , λ34 }
for the two commuting conjugate pairs {λ12 } ∪ {λ̂12 } and {λ34 } ∪ {λ̂34 }. Hence, in addition

to the original one as in Figs. D.9 and D.10, the 2nd version of the quotient algebra is
rendered as in Fig. D.11. This is simply the freedom within a conjugate pair which allows the
two distributions either λij ∈ Wl and λ̂ij ∈ Ŵl or λij ∈ Ŵl and λ̂ij ∈ Wl for each pair of
generators {λij , λ̂ij } as long as conforming to the condition of closure. However, the generators
in the 2nd version involve superpositions of noncommuting spinor generators, such as the part
(σ1 ± σ2 ) of the 2nd qubit in spinor generators of a subspace λ12 ± λ̂34 = 12 (I − σ3 ) ⊗ (σ1 ± σ2 ).
A form of this kind is beyond the current interest.
On the other hand, dividing existing conjugate pairs into refined pairs will become compelling while constructing (co-)quotient algebras of higher ranks [5, 6]. Since center subalgebras in these occasions are a subset of a Cartan subalgebra, every subspace of a such
(co-)quotient algebra is a refined subset partitioned from that of a quotient algebra of rank
zero following the condition of closure Eq. 3.1. More often, the two subspaces of a conjugate
pair are of the same size, i.e., spanned by the same number of generators and thus rl = r̂l . In
fewer cases of (co-)quotient algebras of higher ranks, one of the two subspaces of a conjugate
pair may reduce to null. In practice, there is no order to generate conjugate pairs. Yet, it is
not only essential but also helpful during the construction to check the commutation relations
among the produced subspaces by the condition of closure. At certain stages for instance, the
seed generators needed are better learned by applying this condition to existing pairs.
For the Lie algebra su(2p ), a quotient algebra of rank zero can be directly constructed with
the algorithm by taking a non-intrinsic Cartan subalgebra as the center subalgebra, and every
the subspace Wl or Ŵl is spanned by the same number rl = r̂l = 2p−1 of generators. Starting
with the intrinsic quotient algebra and exercising the conjugate transformation is additionally
required for that of dimension not being a power of 2. Thanks to the algebra isomorphism
and the removing process, there is an alternative way to build quotient algebras of rank zero
{Q(A)} for su(N ) as 2p−1 < N < 2p . Compared with the former edition, this alternative
is likely to be more efficient in particular when the dimension N is large. Implemented on
those of rank zero as an example, the procedure is as simple as follows. The first step is
ˆ of su(2p ) via
to derive the intrinsic quotient algebra {Q(C)} of su(N ) from that {Q(C)}
ˆ
conducting the removing process upon the latter, here C and C being the intrinsic Cartan
subalgebras of su(N ) and su(2p ) respectively. Then in the 2nd step, the quotient algebra
{Q(A)} is obtained right after the conjugate transformation {Q(A)} = U † {Q(C)}U , noticing
that the Cartan subalgebras A ⊂ su(N ) and Â ⊂ su(2p ) share the identical conjugate action
U such that U AU † = C and U ÂU † = Cˆ with A ⊂ Â. Being the unique superset of the
designated counterpart A ⊂ su(N ), the Cartan subalgebra Â ⊂ su(2p ) can be easily decided
in terms of the λ-representation. As to the conjugate transformation, it is convenient to carry
out the calculation in the s-representation, ref. Appendix B, and the form of the action U
will be explicitly given in [4, 6]. The procedure closes at rewriting {Q(A)} in the preferred
representation.
Cartan Decomposition. One of immediate applications of (co-)quotient algebras is the
Cartan decomposition [2, 3]. The algebraic structure of a (co-)quotient algebra enables a
systematic production of Cartan decompositions. A Cartan decomposition of the Lie algebra
su(N ) is referred to as a decomposition su(N ) = t ⊕ p, where the subalgebra t and the subset
p satisfy the condition [t, t] ⊂ t, [t, p] ⊂ p, [p, p] ⊂ t and Tr{t p} = 0. The decomposition is

12

Quotient Algebra Partition and Cartan Decomposition for su(N ) I

not unique. Within a quotient algebra of rank zero of 2p − 1 conjugate pairs, there have in
total 2p choices of Cartan decompositions.
A Cartan decomposition chosen in a quotient algebra is equivalent to a determination of
the subalgebra t, which is formed by taking the union of one subspace of every conjugate
pair following the condition of closure. An example can be prepared in a rank-zero quotient
algebra of either su(8) or su(6), which has 7 conjugate pairs as shown in Figs. D.2-D.5.
The subalgebra t is formed by taking either one subspace of every conjugate pair therein.
However, due to the condition of closure, when the first two subspaces are chosen from the
first two conjugate pairs, the 3rd one from the 3rd pair is also decided. A reminder is that
the conjugate pairs are orderless and the order assignment here is temporarily for the pair
selection. Namely, any two conjugate pairs can be specified as the first two pairs, by which
the 3rd pair is decided due to the condition of closure. Likewise, let the 4th conjugate pair be
arbitrarily picked from the remaining pairs, which together with the early selections decides
the following 5th, 6th and 7th pairs. Then the subspaces from the 5th, 6th and 7th conjugate
pairs are determined once the choice from the 4th conjugate pair is made. For instance, if the
set {W1 , W2 , Ŵ3 , Ŵ4 } is selected, the set to follow is only {W5 , W6 , Ŵ7 }. The subalgebra t is
formed by the union of these two sets t = {W1 , W2 , Ŵ3 , Ŵ4 , W5 , W6 , Ŵ7 }. The subset p is the
union of the center subalgebra A and the remaining subspace in every conjugate pair. It is
plain to confirm the orthogonality Tr{t p} = 0 of the subalgebra and the subset so arranged.
There are in total 23 choices of t from this given quotient algebra. In general, once more a
demonstration of the pre-decision rule on a quotient algebra of 2p − 1 conjugate pairs, the
other 2p − p − 1 subspaces in the subalgebra t are determined by a number p of independent
selections following the condition of clousre Eq. 3.1.
It is noticed that, besides the other 7 alike, the center subalgebra A is a maximal abelian
subalgebra of p. This indicates the category that these decompositions are of type AI [2],
because the maximal abelian subalgebra of the subset p is a Cartan subalgebra of the original
Lie algebra. It will be asserted in a continued episode [5] that the complete set of type-AI
decompositions of a unitary Lie algebra can be acquired by collecting those determined from
quotient algebras of rank zero generated by all its Cartan subalgebras. The determinations
of the other two categoris of decompositions, the types AII and AIII, with quotient algebras
of higher ranks will also be illustrated in the same episode.
5

Recursive Decomposition

As a merit of the structure, a quotient algebra admits the recursive decomposition level by
level. The formation of the above subalgebra t is considered the 1st-level decomposition of
su(N ) and let it be redenoted as t[1] , noting su(N ) = t[0] ⊕ p[0] the 0th-level decomposition
of itself with t[0] = su(N ) and p[0] = {0}. Being a subset of abelian subspaces respecting
the condition of closure equally well, the subalgebra t[1] bears the structure of the quotient
algebra {Q(A[2] ; 2p−1 − 1)}, where A[2] denotes an arbitrary maximal abelian subalgebra of
t[1] assigned as the center subalgebra of the 2nd level. There are in total 2p−1 choices of the
subalgebra of the 2nd level t[2] , for t[1] is partitioned by A[2] into 2p−1 − 1 conjugate pairs.
Similarly, the quotient algebra {Q(A[l] ; 2p−l − 1)} = t[l−1] is constructed at the l-th-level
decomposition for the subalgebra of the (l − 1)-th level t[l−1] , where the center subalgebra
A[l] is a maximal abelian subalgebra of t[l−1] and there has 2p−l choices of the subalgebra of

Zheng-Yao Su

13

next level t[l] . As this process is recursively continued for p times to the final level and the
quotient algebra {Q(A[p] ; 1)} is attained, the Lie algebra su(N ) is fully decomposed.
Directing a such recursive decomposition, a decomposition sequence seqdec is defined
to be the sequence of designated center subalgebras in the recursion order and at last the
subalgebra of the final level, i.e., seqdec = {A[l] : l = 1, 2, · · · , p + 1, A[1] = A and A[p+1] =
t[p] }. Precisely speaking, in a decomposition sequence, the designated center algebra of the
l-th level A[l] ought to be a maximal abelian subalgebra of the subset p[l] of the decomposition
of this level t[l−1] = t[l] ⊕ p[l] . In a decomposition of type AI, the category concerned in this
episode, a maximal abelian subalgebra of p[l] is also a maximal abelian subalgebra of t[l−1] ,
0 < l ≤ p, and it is favorable to take an abelian subspace Wi or Ŵi of the original quotient
algebra {Q(A); 2p − 1)} to be the center subalgebra at every level [4]. More complicated
sequences involving different types of decompositions will be studied in continued episodes [6].
Operator Factorization. According to the KAK theorem [2,3], a Cartan decomposition of
the Lie algebra su(N ) leads to factorizations of actions in SU (N ). That is, there exist vectors
s1 , s2 ∈ t and a ∈ A for every g ∈ su(N ) such that the corresponding group action eig has
a particular form of factorization eig = eis1 eia eis2 , if a Cartan decomposition su(N ) = t ⊕ p
is realized and A is a maximal abelian subalgebra of p. When the decomposition of type
AI is concerned, the computation of a such factorization is operationally equivalent to the
well-known SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) in matrix analysis.
As a consequence of repeating the KAK theorem at each level, a recursive decomposition of
the algebra su(N ), 2p−1 < N ≤ 2p , results in a recursive factorization of an action in SU (N ).
Through the factorization prescribed in the theorem, the action turns into a product of a
number 22p − 1 of component terms eia[l],j contributed from the maximal abelian subalgebras
of decomposition levels and these terms are arranged in the order of a binary bifurcation tree.
A term of the form eia[l],j , a[l],j ∈ A[l] as 1 ≤ l ≤ p and a[p],j ∈ t[p] , is contributed from the
center subalgebra designated at the l-th level or from the subalgebra of the final level. Let
the order of the term in the factorization be written in a binary string of p + 1 digits and
denoted by τlj , 0 ≤ l ≤ p and j = 1, 2, . . . , 2l . The binary-bifurcation-tree order has the first
bit “1” of the string τlj , counting from the rightmost, appear at the (p − l + 1)-th digit. Some
calculation facilities of factorizations led by decomposition sequences of type AI will be given
in [4] and others by sequences of different types will be expounded in [5, 6].
Following a decomposition sequence, the recursive decomposition of a transformation in
SU (N ) implies a path on the manifold of the group. A subalgebra designated in the sequence
may be conceived as a post or a node during the course of the mapping. Rather than in a
serial manner, these posts are visited in a hierarchically recursive order, patterned in a binary
bifurcation tree, which exhibits the nature of recursive decompositions of Lie groups. The
course of a path on the manifold is adjustable by changing designations of subalgebras in the
decomposition sequence. To have a better picture of possible paths upon the group SU (N ),
it is necessary to locate all the Cartan subalgebras of su(N ). The algorithm of the subalgebra
extension introduced in Appendix C suffices the need.
Since every subalgebra in a decomposition sequence is abelian, a transformation in SU (N )
is fully factorized into a product of actions eiωα gα . Wherein a gα is a generator in the chosen
representation and ωα is the parameter acquired by such as the operation of SVD if the type-

14

Quotient Algebra Partition and Cartan Decomposition for su(N ) I

AI decomposition is concerned. Suppose that the dimension N has the prime factorization
N = 2r0 P1 r1 · · · Pf rf , here Pj , j = 1, . . . , f , being a prime greater than 2. An option of
convenience is to put the generators of su(N ) in tensor products of the spinor generators and
those of su(Pj ) phrased in the λ-representation, ref. Appendix A. Each algebra gα thus reads
as a tensor product of Pauli martices, λ-generators and an appropriate number of identity
operators.
Playing a role of a quantum gate, a contributed action eiωα gα is considered local if it
has only one single non-identity operator, i.e., a generator of su(2) or su(Pj ), in the tensorproduct form of gα , and considered nonlocal if otherwise. Accordingly, a decomposition of the
associated algebra as above described makes an arbitrary unitary transformation factorized
into a product of local and nonlocal transformations. Moreover, it is straightforward to further
factorize a nonlocal transformation into a product of local and bipartite actions of an any
specified format resorting to some elementary identities of Lie algebras [6]; a bipartite action
here is referring to a transofmration involving two parties such as, but not restricted to, the
CNOT gate. As an immediate result of an application to an arbitrary unitary operator, this
decomposition scheme also provides an alternative and simple proof for the computational
universality of quantum gates. Refer to [5] for a general proof of the universality.
Corollary 2 An any bipartite gate plus one qubit is computaionally universal.
Since being flexible and offering great freedom to decide paths of decompositions, structures
of quotient algebras expounded in this serial are anticipated to be of help to many inquiries,
not merely confined to determining optimal gate arrangements subject to certain imposed
constraints. More details of various applications derived from these structures and related
schemes will be systematically elucidated elsewhere [4–8].

of the Dirac notation, the generators read as λij = |iihj| + |jihi| and λ̂ij = −i|iihj| + i|jihi|.
Playing the part of σ3 , a diagonal N × N matrix dkl is defined as dkl = |kihk| − |lihl|. A
generating set of the Lie algebra su(N ) can be formed by the N (N − 1)/2 pairs of λij and λ̂ij
in addition to any N − 1 independent diagonal operators dkl , such as d1l , l = 2, 3, . . . , N . It
is plain to confirm that Tr{λ̆ij λ̆kl } = 0 and Tr{λ̆ij C} = 0, λ̆ij 6= λ̆kl , where λ̆ij denotes either
a λij or a λ̂ij and C is the intrinsic center subalgebra of su(N ). Since C ⊂ p, the condition
of orthogonality Tr{tp} = 0 is guaranteed at each level of the decomposition. Although not
compulsory in the decomposition, the orthogonality

An example is the set of the Gell-Mann matrices for su(3), here denoted by µj , 1 ≤ j ≤ 8,

This representation has advantages as well even if the dimension N is a composite number,
say N = 2r0 P1 r1 · · · Pf rf and Pj being primes greater than 2, j = 1, . . . , f . First, let the table
of a quotient algebra for su(2r0 ) be produced by taking an arbitrary center subalgebra in the
spinor representation and exercising the algorithm instructed in Section 4. Before starting
the algorithm, a quick way to build a similar table for su(N ) is then to write the center
subalgebra in tensor products of the spinor generators and the generators of those su(Pj ) in
the λ-representation.

The s-representation is an expression of convenience for spinor generators. Let a 1-qubit
spinor be rephrased in digits, namely Saǫ11 = (|0iha1 |+ (−1)ǫ1 |1ih1 + a1 |), where the bit a1 or ǫ1
is either 0 or 1. Specifically, the elementary Pauli matrices are rewritten in the forms S 00 = I,
S 10 = σ3 , S 01 = σ1 and −iS 11 = σ2 . Being a tensor product of 1-qubit shares, a p-qubit spinor

to the product form of Eq. B.1, it suffices to affirm the relation of Eq. B.2 by verifying the

1-qubit component S11 in an n-qubit spinor Sαζ = i=1 Saǫii , and the accumulated exponent
ζ · α of the phase (±i)ζ·α is modulo 4. While, this phase is often neglected if no confusion
arises. Owing to Eq. B.2, a spinor is involutory

For the Lie algebra su(N ) of dimension 2p−1 < N < 2p not being a power of 2, all the
corresponding conditioned subspaces in the quotient-algebra structure can be obtained by
applying the removing process. In practical calculations, it requires also a reverse process,
the embedding, which has su(N ) be embedded in the space of su(2p ). In an operational
sense, a such embedding process is simply to rewrite the generators of su(N ) in terms of the
s-representation. The set of λ-generators is a suited choice in general as a generating set for
su(N ). To relate to the s-representation, the subscripts of the λ-generators are relabelled in
p-digit strings such that L 0ω,α = iλ̂i,j , L 1ω,α = λi,j and L 1ω,0 − L 1ω+α,0 = 2di,j , where L ǫω,α ≡
|ω ihω + α | + (−1)1+ǫ |ω + α ihω |, i − 1 = ω, j − 1 = ω + α, ω, α ∈ Z2p and ǫ = 0, 1. Apparently,
the generator L ǫω,α belongs to the conditioned subspace Wα or Ŵα in the quotient algebra
{Q(C[0] )} of the intrinsic Cartan subalgebra C[0] . The embedding of su(N ), 2p−1 < N < 2p ,
to su(2p ) is realized by the substitution via the following formulae, here ζ, α, ω ∈ Z2p and
ǫ ∈ Z2 ,

Appendix C Abelian Subalgebra Extension
As aforedescribed, a path on the group manifold of SU (N ) is depending on designations of
subalgebras in a decomposition sequence. For the expositions of quotient algebras of higher
ranks as well [5,6], it becomes essential to search the Cartan subalgebras of su(N ). Toward this
purpose, an easy method taking advantage of quotient algebras of rank zero is here introduced.
This method considers only Cartan subalgebras composed of “basis generators” and ignores
those in superpositions of noncommuting generators. The intrinsic center subalgebra C is
always a convenient choice to start with. Inside an example for su(4) shown in Fig. D.9, the
center subalgebra C = {σ3 ⊗ I, I ⊗ σ3 , σ3 ⊗ σ3 } is placed in the central column of the quotient
algebra. In this quotient algebra, each abelian subspace of the conjugate pairs can find one
corresponding generator in C such that the subspace recovers to be a Cartan subalgebra by
absorbing this generator. For instance, the Cartan subalgebra {I ⊗ σ1 , σ3 ⊗ σ1 , σ3 ⊗ I} is
gained by taking the union of W1 and {σ3 ⊗ I} ⊂ C. Consequently, 6 Cartan subalgebras
of nearest neighbors are extended from C. They form the set of Cartan subalgebras of the
extension of the 1st shell.
Similarly, the Cartan subalgebras of the 2nd-shell extension are constructed from the 6
quotient algebras given by the Cartan subalgebras obtained in the 1st shell. Among other
redundancies, there appear 8 new subalgebras in this shell and no more new member in the
following shells. In other words, the Lie algebra su(4) has 15 Cartan subalgebras in total.
Based on structures of quotient algebras of rank zero, it will be proved in [4] that all the
Cartan subalgebras of the Lie algebra su(N ), 2p−1 < N ≤ 2p , can be found in the first p
shells of the extension. The success of the method is attributed to the key clue that, within
the quotient algebra {Q(A)} given by a Cartan subalgebra A, there exists a commuting subset
B ⊂ A, i.e., [W, B] = 0, for every abelian subspace W ∈ {Q(A)}. Then, another Cartan
subalgebra W ∪ B is extended from A by taking the union of the subspace and the the subset
B, which is known as a maximal bi-subalgebra of A in the language of the s-representation.
For a Lie algebra of dimension a power of 2, the identical set of Cartan subalgebras is
acquired irrespective of with which subalgebra the extension begins. A reminder is that the

20

Quotient Algebra Partition and Cartan Decomposition for su(N ) I

set of Cartan subalgebras of the Lie algebra su(N ) with 2p−1 < N < 2p is obtained by applying
the removing process to the original set of su(2p ). Since each of its Cartan subalgebras has
the same number 2(2p − 1) of nearest neighbors and any one of these subalgebras is reachable
within p shells of the extension regardless of the starting member, it may be of help to envision
the set of Cartan subalgebras of su(2p ) in terms of a hypercube-like topology.
