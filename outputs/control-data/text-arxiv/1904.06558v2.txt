Abstract. We study the magnitude of semiclassical gravity effects near the formation
of a black-hole horizon in spherically-symmetric spacetimes. As a probe for these effects
we use a quantised massless scalar field. Specifically, we calculate two quantities derived
from it: the renormalised stress-energy tensor (a measure of how the field vacuum
state affects the spacetime) and the effective temperature function (a generalisation of
Hawking temperature related to the energy flux of the field vacuum). The subject of
our study are spacetimes which contain a spherical distribution of matter and an empty
exterior Schwarzschild region, separated by a surface which is moving in proximity to
the Schwarzschild radius rs = 2M , with M the total mass. In particular, we analyse
the consequences of three types of surface movement: an oscillation just above rs ,
a monotonous approach towards rs in infinite time and a crossing of rs at different
velocities. For a collapsing matter distribution which follows the expected dynamical
evolution in general relativity, we recover the standard picture of black-hole formation
and its tenuous semiclassical effects. In more general dynamical regimes, allowing
deviations from the standard classical evolution, we obtain a variety of different effects:
from the emission of Hawking-like radiation without the formation of a horizon, to
large values of the renormalised stress-energy tensor, related to the Boulware vacuum
divergence in static spacetimes.

1. Introduction
The theory of quantum fields in curved spacetimes remains, to this day, one of the
leading methods for studying quantum corrections to the evolution of the spacetime
geometry. Historically, one of the most notable results originating from this theory is
that of Hawking radiation [1]: the formation of a black hole entails the emission of
thermal radiation, which through back-reaction can translate into the slow depletion of
the black-hole mass. This quantum effect was later also shown to occur in the presence
of cosmological horizons in an expanding universe [2].
The semiclassical theory is characterised by keeping a classical spacetime
background framework, but introducing quantum corrections to the energy momentum
density which governs its dynamics. This is achieved through calculating the
renormalised stress-energy tensor (RSET) of quantum fields, which takes the stressenergy content of the quantum vacuum to the same footing as the classical matter term
in the Einstein equations. This semiclassical approach can be considered an intermediate
step in the way toward a quantum theory of gravity, in which the interactions of matter
and spacetime would reveal their quantum characteristics more naturally and fully (see
e.g. [3] for a discussion on its interpretation as an approximation to quantum gravity).
The general consensus is that this approximation is valid in regions of spacetime
with sufficiently low, non-Planckian curvature (e.g. the horizon of astrophysical black
holes), where it provides insightful information about quantum corrections to classical
general relativity. These corrections are, however, suppressed by Planck’s constant,
and although they have far-reaching conceptual implications, they appear practically
irrelevant for most astrophysical processes. Still, there might exist situations in which
this suppression could be overcome, as we will see in this work.
When quantising a field in a curved spacetime, there is no preferred slicing in
spacelike hypersurfaces (orthogonal to a timelike vector field) on which to define an
operator algebra. This leads to a corresponding ambiguity in the choice of the vacuum
and particle states of the field. An interesting example which illustrates this ambiguity,
and is particularly relevant to this work, is the following. If we consider a static black
hole and quantise with respect to the Schwarzschild time coordinate, we get a definition
of particles which becomes more similar to the one in Minkowski spacetime the farther
away from the horizon you are, matching perfectly in the asymptotic region where
spacetime is flat (the corresponding vacuum state is known as the Boulware vacuum
[4, 5]). However, at the horizon itself operator expectation values in this state present
a divergent behaviour, owing to the irregularity of the Schwarzschild time coordinate
there. This particular quantisation is therefore deemed as nonphysical, backing up the
idea that there should not exist eternal black holes in our universe which would require
it. A somewhat more physically reasonable scenario is that of an asymptotically flat
(ignoring cosmological backgrounds) spacetime with an initially dispersed distribution
of matter, which eventually collapses to form a black hole. In it, we can choose an
asymptotically Minkowskian quantisation in the asymptotic past, which can be extended

Semiclassical gravity effects near horizon formation

to the whole spacetime (through the solutions of the field equation). The vacuum state
for this quantisation is known as the in vacuum, for which the Hawking radiation result
was obtained, and in which, unlike the case of the Boulware vacuum state, observables
are regular at the horizon. The in vacuum is in fact the physical vacuum state one
should consider when dealing with a black-hole formation process in an asymptotically
flat spacetime.
When using this vacuum, the overall resulting picture is that any stellar-mass object
which collapses rapidly toward the formation of a horizon generates extremely small
RSETs. It is important to stress that “rapidly” in the previous sentence corresponds
precisely to the standard situation one would expect when working in the framework of
general relativity (defined by the Einstein field equations coupled to matter satisfying
the standard energy conditions [6, 7]) and taking into account the forces that are known
to play a role in stellar evolution. In these situations, semiclassical effects are in fact so
small, that the collapse would proceed in almost exactly the same manner as in classical
general relativity, forming a trapping horizon and continuing until the appearance of
a Planck curvature region (see e.g. [8, 9] for the first treatments of this problem and
[10, 11] for modern retakes). The crucial hypothesis of “rapid approach toward the
formation of a horizon” is, therefore, perfectly sensible in most scenarios. However,
the presence of a quantum bounce at Planck curvatures [12, 13, 14] or the presence
of metastable states before horizon formation [10] might lead to situations in which
this hypothesis is questionable. For instance, the divergent behaviour of the Boulware
vacuum may be taken as a hint of the possibility that even in a physical vacuum, the
surroundings of a black-hole horizon may be a region where semiclassical corrections
become large enough to be relevant to the evolution of the system. Indeed, as we will
show, the hypothetical formation of ultracompact objects sustained very close to horizon
formation (an alternative to black holes [15, 16, 17, 18, 19]) appears to require at least a
semiclassical treatment. Generally, if the RSET contribution overcomes its suppression
by Planck’s constant and becomes comparable to the classical stress-energy tensor, then
a complete, non-perturbative semiclassical treatment of the problem is in order.
In this work we study the values of the RSET for the in vacuum of a free massless
scalar field in spherically-symmetric geometries which approach the formation of a
horizon in different ways. Previous works with the same motivation have checked some
of the semiclassical effects produced by a collapse of matter which quickly decelerates
just before reaching the formation of a horizon [20, 21]. Our present goal is to more
generally identify the precise geometric characteristics of the dynamical situations which
would cause large back-reaction close to horizon formation.
In section 2 we start by reviewing the definitions of the functions which measure
the deviation from classical physics. One of them is the already mentioned RSET,
which directly serves as a source in the Einstein equations. The other is the effective
temperature function (ETF) introduced in [22]. This is a generalisation of the Hawking
temperature which characterises the flux of outgoing radiation at future infinity. As was
shown in [23], this function is directly related to the term in the RSET evaluated in

Semiclassical gravity effects near horizon formation

dynamical vacua which regularises the divergence at the horizon of the static Boulware
vacuum.
Also in sec. 2, we will introduce the generic structure of the geometries we will use,
namely a Schwarzschild exterior and a Minkowski interior, separated by a thin spherical
shell which moves radially along some timelike curve. We will provide a physical
interpretation for the relations between the static null coordinates corresponding to
the interior and exterior regions, which will allow us to understand how the modes of
the massless field are dispersed when crossing the shell. After this, we will move on to
specifying what types of trajectories for the shell will be used: oscillations close to (but
above) the horizon, asymptotic approach to horizon formation and actual formation of a
horizon at low velocities. These are the three types of curves which exploit the physics
of being close to horizon formation. Before embarking on a detailed study of these
cases, we will explain briefly the different notions of horizon that one can define and
their relevance for our analysis. In this introduction we have been deliberately vague in
this respect; let us only advance that “horizon” must be identified with the notion of
apparent/trapping horizon and not with event horizon, unless explicitly stated. Let us
also note that most of the results in this paper will be phrased in terms of an exterior
Schwarzschild geometry, but they are in fact more general and will apply equally to any
exterior geometry with a non-zero surface gravity at the horizon.
In section 3 we will study shell trajectories which oscillate just above the
Schwarzschild radius rs = 2M , M being the mass of the shell (note that we will always
be using natural units G = ~ = c = 1). This will serve as an example which illustrates
how the relations between the null coordinates are associated to semiclassical effects in
different dynamical regimes close to horizon formation.
In section 4 we will explore shell trajectories which approach the horizon so slowly
that they do not reach it in finite time. For this case, as we will show, the thin-shell
approximation misses some important effects. Therefore we will extend our study to
an arbitrary spherically-symmetric geometry for the interior region. The results we are
interested in will be obtained through a study of the asymptotic future values of the
ETF, which will allow us to compare the in vacuum state to the Boulware vacuum.
In section 5 we will go back to the thin-shell approximation and study geometries
in which a horizon is formed in finite time. In this case the asymptotic behaviour of
both the ETF and the RSET are well-known [1, 8] so we will focus on their values at
times close to the formation of the horizon. Particularly, we will vary the velocity at
which the shell crosses the r = 2M surface, paying close attention to the lower velocity
results. In the final section we will summarise our findings.
2. Preliminaries
The overall aim of this work is to gauge the magnitude of semiclassical effects in a series
of specific dynamical and spherically-symmetric geometries, characterised for being close
to the formation of a horizon. As is common in black-hole physics, we will use a single

Semiclassical gravity effects near horizon formation

massless scalar field as a probe. For the calculation of the RSET, we will be making
use of an analytic approximation to its exact form, which amounts to considering only
the s-wave contributions and neglecting the backscattering effects of the geometry. As
we will see, the closeness of the spacetime to the formation of a horizon is going to be
a key factor for the behaviour of the RSET.
2.1. Renormalised stress-energy tensor in 1+1 dimensions
The analytic approximation to the RSET we will be considering takes advantage of
the conformal invariance of a massless scalar field equation in 1+1 dimensions. All
4-dimensional spherically-symmetric metrics can be written as
ds2 = −C(u, v)dudv + r2 dΩ22 ,

(1)

where C(u, v) is a positive function of the radial null coordinates (non-zero for
regular coordinates). The calculation of the dimensionally reduced 1+1 RSET attends
exclusively to the {u, v} coordinates, i.e. to the radial-temporal part of the geometry.
In this approximation, C(u, v) is the conformal factor which rescales the otherwise flat
two-dimensional spacetime.
A massless scalar field φ can be Fock-quantised on this background with a basis of
solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation given by the ingoing and outgoing modes

e−iωu ,
φuω = √

φvω = √
e−iωv ,

(2)

where ω > 0. Such a basis exists for any pair of null coordinates which cover the
spacetime. Choosing a particular pair amounts to a choice of vacuum and particle
states of the quantum field.
The RSET is the renormalised vacuum expectation value of the stress-energy tensor
operator constructed with the quantum field. For a choice of null coordinates {u, v} and
a corresponding vacuum |0i, the components of the RSET in this same coordinate basis
are (see [24])

Only the trace of the RSET depends explicitly on the curvature: Tµµ = R/24π (see
e.g. [3, 24, 25]). On the other hand, the traceless part of the RSET can be expressed
in a geometric form in terms of the norm of the timelike vector field ∂t = ∂u + ∂v that
defines the vacuum state |0i [26]. This means that the traceless (and state-dependent)
part of the RSET could in principle become large in regions of low curvature.

The choice of quantisation modes and vacuum state for this theory is arbitrary. In a
different vacuum state 0̃ , corresponding to a quantisation characterised by a different

where g 0 ≡ ∂ũ g(ũ) and h0 ≡ ∂ṽ h(ṽ). With these expressions we can see that a change
in the vacuum state translates into the addition of outgoing and ingoing radiation flux
terms (which can be positive or negative).
Apart from the RSET, we are interested in studying the values of the effective
temperature function (ETF) [22], defined as

for the outgoing radiation sector, and likewise substituting u’s for v’s (and g for h) for
the ingoing sector. In the case of a spacetime representing the formation of a black hole,
the usual Hawking effect is reflected in the constant value κuuout
= 1/2 = 2πTH , where TH
in
is the Hawking temperature in natural units. In more general terms, if κuũ or κvṽ remain
constant for a sufficiently long period of time (defined by an adiabaticity condition), the
vacuum state defined by the {ũ, ṽ} coordinates (through the modes in (2)) will be seen
by an observer with proper coordinates {u, v} as a thermal state of outgoing or ingoing
radiation respectively [22].
This function is also directly related to the outgoing and ingoing radiation fluxes
which appear in the RSET after a change of vacuum state [23]. Specifically, equations (5)
can be written as

(7c)

In other words, the information about the difference between the RSETs in two different
vacuum states is entirely contained in their relative ETFs (and first derivatives thereof).

7

Semiclassical gravity effects near horizon formation

When calculating either of these quantities, the information about the choice of
vacuum state is encoded in specific sets of null coordinates. The fact that the RSET
is defined by relations between null coordinates is the reason why its expression is not
generally given by geometric quantities that can be reduced to curvature invariants, and
why it can in principle become large in regions of low curvature (as we will see explicitly).
For the spacetimes we will study, we are interested in calculating these quantities for
two special quantum vacuum states: the in and the out states. The in-state (out-state)
is the one defined by affine null coordinates at past (future) null infinity. In order to
carry out the calculation, we will want to extend these sets of coordinates throughout
the whole spacetime, if possible, and obtain the relations between them. However, if
there is a horizon present at some point, one or both of these extensions may cover
the spacetime only partially. For example, in a collapsing geometry which starts being
almost flat and ends up forming a black hole, the in-state corresponds to the natural
Minkowski vacuum at the asymptotic past which then evolves according to the dynamics
of the system. On the other hand, the out-state would correspond asymptotically to
the Boulware state, and its extension backward in time would cover only the region of
spacetime outside the event horizon.
2.2. Thin-shell geometries with spherical symmetry
The geometries that we will analyse all consist of an internal Minkowskian region pasted
to an external Schwarzschild region of mass M through a moving timelike shell. In the
interior region one can write the metric as
2
ds2− = −du− dv− + r−
dΩ2 ,

(8)

where the subscript “−” refers to the interior region, and the radial null coordinates are
related to the Minkowski time t− and radius r− through
u− = t− − r− ,

v− = t− + r− .

(9)

Equivalently we can construct natural null coordinates in the Schwarzschild region as
2
ds2+ = −|f (r+ )|du+ dv+ + r+
dΩ2 ,

(10)

where f (r) = 1 − 2M/r is the redshift function, and in this case the null coordinates
are related to the Schwarzschild time t+ and radius r+ through
∗
u+ = sign [f (r+ )] (t+ − r+
),

∗
v+ = t+ + r+
.

(11)

∗
∗
Here r+
is the tortoise coordinate obtained by integrating dr+
= dr+ /f (r+ ). The
u+ coordinate goes from −∞ to +∞, that is, between past null infinity and the
Schwarzschild radius (if the exterior region reaches that far in). Inside the Schwarzschild
radius (but outside the shell) we must define a different coordinate ui+ , given by the same
∗
relation to t+ and r+
as u+ above, and which goes from −∞ at the horizon, until it

8

reaches some point of the spacelike singularity at some finite value. On the horizon
itself, relations with this variable can only be obtained as a limit from either side. The
sign of f (r+ ) ensures that u+ and ui+ advance in the same direction as u− , both outside
and inside the horizon.
The two geometries are connected by a thin spherical shell of mass M . In general,
this matching is only possible if the shell’s radial position follows a spacetime curve
of the same causality type as seen from either side. In our case, we will require that
this be a timelike trajectory, parametrised by v− = T− (u− ) from the inside and by
v+ = T+ (u+ ) from the outside. Of course, given one of these curves the other is also
fixed. For convenience we will also define the velocity parameters
α− ≡

dv−
du−

shell

α+ ≡

(12)
shell

(which are simply the derivatives of T± ), both of which take values in (0, ∞) for a
timelike trajectory. For an ingoing shell to approach the speed of light would imply
approaching the limit α± → 0. On the other hand, for an outgoing shell reaching the
speed of light α± → ∞. A static shell has α± = 1.
In order to complete the definition of this geometry, we must require that the metric
be continuous at the shell. This will allow us to determine the trajectory of the shell as
seen from one side if it is defined on the other. It will also allow us to extend the “+”
coordinates into the “−” region and vice versa.
From matching the null part of the line elements we obtain the functions defined
in (4),

which can be expressed in either the “+” or “−” variables. From matching the radial
parts we get the relation between the velocity parameters of the shell from either side,

4α− f + (1 − α− )2 .

(14)

Thus if we define the trajectory in terms of T− , we can obtain T+ by integrating α+ from
the same initial radial position. We can also obtain the relations u+ (u− ) and v+ (v− ) by
integrating the functions g and h.
From the square root in (14) we deduce a condition for the continuous matching
of the geometries, namely that the α− parameter which defines the movement of their
separation surface must be such that 4α− f + (1 − α− )2 remains positive. In other
words, α− must tend to zero (the infalling shell must approach light-speed) inside the
Schwarzschild radius in such a way as to compensate the increasingly negative value of
the redshift function. The parameter α− which satisfies
4α− f |shell + (1 − α− )2 = 0

(15)

defines the slowest possible collapse inside the event horizon as seen from the (rapidly
disappearing) Minkowski region.

Let us focus on the function g outside the Schwarzschild radius,

(16)

The presence of the term 1/ f is to be expected, as it represents the redshift experienced
by an outgoing light ray. This can be seen most clearly in the case of a static shell (which,
of course, would sit outside the horizon), for which α± = 1. There, it is necessary for
a rescaling of the coordinates compatible with a matching of the angular parts of the
geometry.
The α− /α+ term has a purely dynamical origin. The velocity of the shell seen by
a static observer on one of its sides is different from the one seen by a static observer
on the other. In their respective null coordinates this can be seen as a change in the
slope of the line tangent to the shell trajectory, namely α− → α+ (see fig. 1). From the
perspective of the shell, which can use the appropriate coordinates for each side, this
looks something like a spacetime refraction phenomenon. If a light ray incides with an
angle θ with respect to the shell trajectory from the inside, it exits with an angle θ0
related to the first by
tan θ0
α−

.
(17)

For the angles formed by an ingoing ray, the relation is the inverse of the above.
Another way to interpret the α− /α+ term is as a kind of Doppler effect, even
though technically there is no interaction between the matter in the shell and the light
ray crossing it which could cause absorption and reemission. The effect can be seen
clearly with the following. If we define
R(t± ) ≡ r|shell (t± ) and Ṙ = dR/dt− ,
then

R0 = dR/dt+ ,

(18)

1 + Ṙ
1 + R0 /f (R)
, α+ =
.
(19)
1 − R0 /f (R)
1 − Ṙ
That is, the quotient α− /α+ represents the Doppler shift for a ray that is “absorbed”
at one side by a shell moving at a velocity Ṙ and “reemitted” on the other by a shell
α− =

Semiclassical gravity effects near horizon formation

10

moving at a different velocity, R0 /f (R). If the geometry on both sides were the same,
there would be no net effect, as these velocities would be the same.
It is worth mentioning that there may be a difficulty in interpreting the above
expressions at the Schwarzschild radius, since the coordinate t+ used for the derivative
in the second equation in (19) is not regular there. To see the behaviour of α+ more
clearly we can switch to a regular time coordinate, say the Painlevé-Gullstrand τ+
defined as the proper time of a free-falling observer from infinity in the Schwarzschild
region [27], which satisfies
p
1 − f (r+ )
dr+ .
(20)
dτ+ = dt+ +
f (r+ )
We can then define the radial velocity R,τ ≡ dR/dτ+ , which is regular at the horizon.
Then the second equation in (19) becomes
p
1 + R,τ /(1 + 2M/R)
p
α+ =
,
(21)
1 − R,τ /(1 − 2M/R)

from which we can see that at r = 2M , α+ = 0p
and the function g in (16) diverges.
In light of these results, we will call the 1/ |f | terms in the functions g and h the
“redshift” terms, and the ones with a quotient of α’s the “Doppler” terms. Combining
equations (13), (19) and (21) we can write the total functions as
s

in which all quantities are evaluated at the points where the lines u = const. and
v = const. intersect the shell trajectory respectively. We could work directly with these
expressions instead of (13) by defining the trajectory through the velocities Ṙ and R,τ ,
which must satisfy a relation similar to (14). However, throughout this work we will keep
using the α± parameters, as they are more natural and simple when dealing with the
relations between null coordinates needed for the calculation of semiclassical quantities.
2.4. Geometries near horizon formation
The geometries we are going to study are all characterised by being close to horizon
formation in a specific sense that is clarified in this section. Probably the bestknown characterisation of black holes is the classical one in terms of event horizons,
the definition of which exploits the notion of future null infinity in asymptotically flat
spacetimes [28]. However, event horizons display a number of undesirable features, such
as their lack of univocal relation with strong gravitational fields [29], or their nonlocal
nature that forbids their detection in experiments (that necessarily take place in finite

Semiclassical gravity effects near horizon formation

11

regions of spacetime) [30]. Even if the geometries analysed below contain event horizons,
the notion of being close to horizon formation that is relevant to our analysis is always
described in terms of local properties of spacetime and matter fields, and is closely
related to (quasi-)local definitions of the boundaries of black holes in terms of apparent
horizons. One can alternatively use the concept of trapping horizons or other equivalent
definitions (see [31], for instance, for a review); however, in the situations analysed
here, all these definitions become equivalent, so there is no need for us to discuss their
differences. In some of the geometries analysed below, the position of apparent/trapping
horizons and event horizons are coincident. This should not be taken as an indication
that our results are tied in any way with the formation of event horizons. In fact, it is
always possible to deform these geometries in a way that event horizons are removed
completely, but the local geometric conditions that eventually lead to their formation
in the undeformed geometries are maintained for arbitrarily long times (for geometries
in which apparent/trapping horizons are formed in finite time, this would imply that
they remain present for a large, but finite, amount of time), which would yield the same
results but for arbitrarily small deviations.
One of the shortcomings of these (quasi-)local definitions of the boundaries of black
holes (with respect to the notion of event horizon) is their non-uniqueness [32]. This issue
disappears in practice when dealing with spherically-symmetric backgrounds, as one can
focus on trapping horizons that are spherically-symmetric as well, the location of which
turn out to be determined by the quasi-local Misner-Sharp mass [33] that measures the
overall energy enclosed in a given sphere [34]. When the external geometry to the shell
is the Schwarzschild geometry, the location of the horizon defined this way is simply the
Schwarzschild radius.
In this work, “close to horizon formation” will therefore mean that the shell has
trajectories exploring the surroundings of the Schwarzschild radius. There, we expect
to find interesting semiclassical effects, and we want to understand their dependence
on the precise dynamical properties of the spacetime as it approaches this point. To
this end, we have chosen three types of shell trajectories, the study of which we believe
will lead to the necessary insight for any general situation. The first type of situation,
studied in sec. 3, is when a shell oscillates between two radii, outside but near the
Schwarzschild radius. This situation models in the easiest terms ultracompact objects
subject to small pulsations. Varying the characteristics of this oscillation will allow us to
explore a wide range of short-term dynamical behaviours. The second type of situation
(sec. 4) will explore the consequences of a long-term monotonous dynamical behaviour,
particularly one which we expect (both a priori and based on results of sec. 3) to
present interesting semiclassical effects – a shell approaching the Schwarzschild radius
asymptotically in a regular time coordinate. As we will see, in this study it will become
apparent that we need to go beyond the thin-shell approximation. The asymptotic
approach can be stopped at any time, so that these configurations could model, for
example, a relaxation phase towards an ultracompact object. For the third type we go
back to thin shells, and conclude our study with the case in which they actually form

Semiclassical gravity effects near horizon formation

a horizon in finite regular time, though they do so while moving at an arbitrarily slow
pace. Our analysis here, which is an extension to [10], allows us to clearly see how the
strength of semiclassical effects depends crucially on the collapsing velocity at horizon
formation. This will provide a counterpoint to the already well-known results for a shell
collapsing at high velocities or even light speed (see e.g. [25]).
It is worth mentioning at this point that our analysis throughout this work will
be purely geometrical, and thus goes beyond the Einstein equations. In other words,
we will be exploring the effects of a geometry on semiclassical quantities without being
concerned with how the geometry itself is generated. In other words, we will not require
that the evolution of the geometry be governed by the Einstein equation with a stressenergy tensor which satisfies some energy conditions. Although it is certainly interesting
to study the properties of the matter content (both classical and semiclassical) which
would generate the geometries in question, this lies beyond the scope of the present work.
Instead, our geometry-based results will just point the way toward the configurations
which should be analysed in further detail in future works in the context of semiclassical
gravity.
3. Oscillating thin shells
In this section we will study the behaviour of the functions g and h, which relate the
“+” and “−” coordinates, when the shell gets near the formation of a horizon, but
does not reach it. Nonetheless, it will follow a trajectory which covers a wide range
of dynamical configurations, in which both the redshift and Doppler effects will have
significant contributions to the values of these functions and their derivatives. Namely,
we will consider a high-speed radial oscillation about a point just above the surface with
radius rs = 2M (in the following, we will always take rs = 1 for numerical evaluations).
We will use three parameters to describe this movement: the distance d of the centre
of oscillation to the horizon, the amplitude A and the frequency ω. Then, the radius at
which the shell is located will follow the spacetime curve (see fig. 2)
R(t− ) = rs + d + A sin(ωt− ).

(23)

In order to avoid the formation of a horizon and maintain a timelike trajectory, the
parameters must satisfy the relations
A < d and Aω < 1.

(24)

We stress once again that the purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of
the relation between dynamical regimes close to horizon formation and the magnitude of
semiclassical effects, and not to provide a self-consistent solution with a classical matter
content which satisfies some energy conditions. Thus we only impose that the shell be
causal, with no further restrictions to its trajectory.

A = 0.099 and ω = 10). The dashed line represents the r = 2M (= 1) surface,
and the diagonal lines represent a light ray entering and exiting the interior region.
Although not perceived in the figure, the thick oscillatory curve does not touch the
r = 2M line.

Since the trajectory is described in terms of the interior coordinate system, we can
obtain the simple expression for the interior velocity parameter
α− =

rs + Aω cos(ωt− )
,
rs − Aω cos(ωt− )

(25)

while for α+ we must use eq. (14). To evaluate these quantities on the points where the
shell trajectory intersects the lines of constant u or v we must solve a transcendental
equation, which we will do numerically. First we will obtain the individual values of the
functions g and h, which represent the change in the coordinate description of outgoing
and ingoing radial light rays respectively. Then we will calculate the quotient g/h with h
evaluated at a point of entry v− of a light ray into the Minkowski region and g evaluated
at the point of exit u− , which carries information of how light rays suffer a temporal
dispersion by passing through this region. Looking at eq. (9) we can see that an ingoing
ray v− connects with an outgoing ray with u− = v− , so the quotient we are looking for is
g(v− )/h(v− ). This quantity will also describe the evolution of the in quantum vacuum
state, defined at the asymptotically flat region at past null infinity, and its comparison
with the out vacuum state, defined at future null infinity.
In figure 3 we observe the values of the functions g and h evaluated at u− and
v− = u− , representing the dispersion of a light ray when it is exiting and entering
the interior region respectively. The net effect, given by g/h, reduces to nearly unity
when g(u− ) ' h(u− ), which occurs when the shell is oscillating very slowly (at low ω)
compared to the time it takes for light to cross it (in the static limit, g/h = 1). At higher
frequencies the light rays enter and exit at completely different points of the oscillation,
as in the case represented in fig. 2, and the net effect becomes appreciable. It is easy
to notice that there are some special cases for this net effect corresponding to different
resonances between the oscillation frequency and the crossing time of the light ray: say,
when it enters crossing a maximum and also exits crossing one, or crossing a minimum,

and three different frequencies: ω = 10, ω = 0.5 and ω = 0.1. The peaks are produced
when the shell is nearly at the closest point to the horizon, as will be discussed
below. We observe that at low frequencies the functions practically coincide since
the light rays enter and leave the interior region in a time much smaller than ω −1 ,
so the in-crossing and out-crossing dispersion effects would almost cancel out (i.e.
g(u− )/h(v− = u− ) ' 1). At somewhat larger frequencies the light rays enter and exit
at appreciably different points of the oscillation and the functions attain a relative
displacement. Finally, at frequencies which make the shell move at nearly light-speed
the displacement is greater still, and the peaks become somewhat tilted to one side for
each function, due to the fact that the peaks of the sine function in t− become tilted
when seen in the u− and v− coordinates (in opposite directions).

and a few other such situations. These will be studied in more detail in the following
subsection.
3.1. Resonance between in-crossing and out-crossing effects
From equations (13) we can obtain the expression for the total temporal dispersion
suffered by a light ray entering the shell at a point “in” and exiting at a point “out”,

where in the first step we have made use of the fact that for rays reflecting at the origin
dv− |in /du− |out = 1, as can be seen from (9). We can see again that for a static shell,
for which the surface redshift function would be constant and α± = 1, this quotient
reduces to unity. For a moving shell the effects can cancel out again only in one special
case, which occurs when not only the in and out redshift functions are the same, but
also when α− = 1 (and therefore α+ = 1 as well, as can be seen from eq. (14)) at

15

both points. For the case of an oscillating shell this can occur only when a light ray
exists such that it both enters and exits at a minimum or at a maximum of R(t− ).
Then the effects cancel out locally, but they continue being non-trivial for the rest of
the light rays. These local resonances are possible only when the frequency, amplitude
and distance from the horizon satisfy the relations

for a ray entering and exiting at a minimum, and likewise

for a maximum. These expressions are obtained simply by comparing the ray crossing
time and the oscillation periods in the coordinate t− . The upper bound on the values of
n comes from the causal restriction Aω < 1. For a shell following an arbitrary (known)
radial motion such cases can be found just as easily.
On the other hand, if we want to see when a maximisation of duout /dvin in eq. (26)
takes place, a more detailed analysis is necessary. First, we may notice that when a light
ray enters at a maximum of R(t− ) and exits at a minimum, the total redshift effect is
maximised. For such a ray to exist, the relation between the parameters must be

In fig. 4 we observe the three terms of the rhs of eq. (26) plotted (without the square
roots) for this case. The peaks of the redshift term, which correspond to precisely the
light rays described, reach their highest possible values for the parameters A and d used.
Also in fig. 4, we observe that the individual Doppler terms have distinct maxima.
For the in-crossing term the maximum is produced for a ray which enters slightly after
the one which maximises redshift (which enters at a maximum of R), during the in-fall
of the shell. For the out-crossing term it is produced for a ray which exits slightly before
redshift maximising one (which exits at a minimum of R), so again during an in-fall
of the shell. Guided by this result, we can look for the conditions which maximise the
individual Doppler terms, and also see whether there is a frequency for the shell at
which the two peaks coincide to make a maximum net effect. In fig. 5 we can directly
see the values which α− /α+ takes at different redshifts f and velocity parameters α− .
At the very minimum of the oscillation of the shell (the closest point to r = rs ),
α− /α+ = 1 and there is no Doppler effect for any redshift f . When the shell is moving
outward (α− > 1) but is still close to the horizon (f  1), from eq. (14) we get

that is, at a constant velocity the Doppler term has a linear dependence on the redshift
function, with a slope which grows rapidly as α− → 1+ and which tends to 1 as α− → ∞.

parameters d = 10, A = 9.99 and ω = 0.1. The region with a sharp gradient close to
the horizon (f = 0) is produced around α− = 1 (1/2 in the graphic), corresponding
to the transition from falling inward (during which time α− < 1) to going outward
(during which α− > 1). At f → 1 the value of the Doppler term tends to 1 smoothly,
as the interior and exterior geometries become the same.

of their product gives duout /dvin ) for an oscillation with parameters d = 0.1, A = 0.099
and ω ' 9.42, given by eq. (27) with n = 3. In this case we see the Doppler term clearly
dominates. Right: in-crossing and out-crossing Doppler terms plotted separately. We
observe the almost-coincidence of the two Doppler peaks, produced for two very close
rays passing through the shell slightly before the one which enters and exits at a
minimum of the oscillation. This near-coincidence results in the dominance of the net
Doppler term in the left graph.

its precise position is influenced by two factors: at a constant f it is maximum at
the highest velocity (lowest α− ), increasing parabolically as α− decreases, while at a
constant velocity it is maximum at the lowest f , with a hyperbolic divergence at f = 0.
If α− approaches 1 while f approaches 0, that is, if the shell tends to a full stop just
before the formation of the horizon, then, when f is sufficiently small, the hyperbolic
divergence dominates over the parabolic tendency to zero and the maximum is reached
at a point very close to the minimum value of f , just before the region of very large
gradient observed in fig. 5 is entered. If, on the other hand, the shell oscillations are
produced far away from the Schwarzschild radius rs , the maximum Doppler effect is
reached closer to the point of maximum in-fall velocity (minimum α− ).
As an example, in fig. 6 we can see the almost-coincidence of the two Doppler
peaks (it looks exact in the figure) for an oscillation which bounces at d − A = 10−3 rs ,
with a frequency ω which allows rays which enter at a minimum of R to also exit at
a minimum. The rays which maximise the in-crossing and out-crossing Doppler effects
almost coincide with the ones which cancel out the redshift effect, and even more so
with each other. Even when the peaks do not exactly coincide, due to their widths the
net Doppler effect given by their product can be very close to its maximum possible
value.
To conclude, these resonant cases have allowed us to understand the behaviour of
the quotient g/h around its highest values, and relate it to specific dynamical regimes
of the shell. As we will see, the observed regions of rapid increase or decrease will have
significant influence on the behaviour of semiclassical effects.

3.2. Semiclassical effects
So far we have studied the dispersion of light rays (or analogously, of modes of the
massless scalar field) which cross the oscillating shell and pass through the interior
Minkowski region. From these results we can directly calculate the semiclassical
quantities discussed earlier, namely the ETF and the RSET. The behaviour of these
quantities will be similar to that of the dispersion functions described above, as the
former are constructed simply from derivatives of the latter. The structure of peaks
and plateaus for each period of the oscillation will merely become more exaggerated for
these new functions. For reference, the structure of the ETF due to a single interval
of deceleration during collapse has been previously studied with some detail in [21].
Our study is based on considerably different dynamics, but the results are qualitatively
similar.

In fig. 7 we can see the ETF κuuout

seen in the in vacuum state by an inertial observer at future null infinity, calculated with
the relation between the in and out coordinates given by the product of the functions
plotted in fig. 4 through eq. (26). As can be guessed by observing the curves in

contributions. On the other hand, the largest negative and positive peaks are produced
on the regions of large gradient on either side of the maximum of the redshift contribution
(keep in mind that the horizontal axes of the two plots are rescaled versions of each
other). Between each set of peaks there is a region of smoothly decreasing temperature,
with values around the Hawking temperature.
In fig. 8 we have plotted the outgoing radiation flux at future null infinity, defined
as the difference between hTuout uout i evaluated for the in and out vacuum states. From
equations (7) we see that this quantity depends on κuuout
and its derivative, explaining the
in
somewhat similar, but amplified, characteristics. This quantity alone is representative of
the highs and lows of the RSET during the oscillation, since the term which is missing
is simply the Boulware vacuum polarisation, which maintains low values in the uout
coordinate (outside the horizon it is below the Hawking flux value in fig. 8). It is the uout
coordinate itself which tends to become non-regular, leading to a general amplification
of both terms (tending to a divergence at the horizon if they do not perfectly compensate
each other).
In fig. 9 we observe the ETF for the oscillation which maximises the net Doppler
effect. The two most notable differences with respect to the case which maximises
redshift are the somewhat cleaner large peaks, caused by a better overall coincidence
in the aspects of the in-crossing and out-crossing effects around the minima of the
oscillation, and a less clean intermediate region, caused in turn by a worse coincidence
there.
In order to give a more general picture of the semiclassical effects produced by
this type of shell trajectory, we can study the consequence of changing the order of
magnitude of each of the oscillation parameters. First, in fig. 10 we see the behaviour of

Figure 8. Difference between the uout uout components of the RSET in the in and out
vacuum states, corresponding to the outgoing flux of radiation which appears at future

to the rays which enter at a maximum of the oscillation and exit at a minimum, which
maximises the redshift effect, and a more flat intermediate region of values near that

the ETF for an oscillation with the same proximity to the horizon (between 0.001 and
0.201 times rs ) but with a much lower velocity, reaching at most about 0.15% of the
speed of light. In this case all semiclassical fluxes are greatly diminished, approaching
the static shell limit in which the radiation temperature and flow become zero.
Another possibility is to maintain the maximum proximity to the horizon (10−3 rs )
and the large maximum speed (∼ 99% the speed of light), but to vary the amplitude of
the oscillation. Decreasing the amplitude leads to a qualitatively similar result for the
ETF: each period contains a cluster of large peaks (larger as the amplitude decreases)
surrounded by a region of values close to the Hawking temperature. On the other hand,
increasing the amplitude to above 0.1rs leads to a general decrease in the values at both
the peaks and the intermediate regions.

Figure 10. ETF in the outgoing radiation sector, for an oscillation at a low velocity
(less then or equal to 0.15% the speed of light) and with a radial proximity to the
horizon between 10−3 rs and 0.2rs (the same as in all the cases seen so far). Compared
to the cases with higher velocities, we observe a significant decrease of its values and
a smoothing of its derivative.

The last parameter we can vary is the proximity to the horizon. Understandably,
if the shell oscillates very far from the horizon, the ETF and its first derivative become
very small, even if the maximum velocities are large. On the other hand, if the shell
is close to the horizon, around 10−3 rs or closer at the minimum of the oscillation, and
its amplitude is not very large, then the closer it is, the larger the peaks become, but
the intermediate region again remains at values around the Hawking temperature on
average.
4. Approaching the horizon asymptotically
For the case of an oscillating shell studied so far, we have noted that the highest values of
the functions which measure the dynamical semiclassical effects are produced when the
horizon is approached at very low velocities (around the minima of the oscillation). In

Semiclassical gravity effects near horizon formation

21

fig. 5 this was seen through the large gradient in the Doppler term around α− = 1 at low
values of the redshift function f , since both the ETF and the RSET have a dependence
precisely on the derivatives of this term. To explore the gap between the cases in which
the shell bounces back before forming a horizon, and the ones in which it continues
to fall and forms a black hole (which will be the subject of the next section), we can
study shell trajectories which tend to the r = rs surface asymptotically, i.e. those that
approach the f → 0 and α− → 1− limit monotonously and reach it in an infinite regular
time parameter. In [35] it was first shown that configurations of this sort can lead to
Hawking-like radiation with arbitrarily long duration without necessarily forming any
type of horizon. Then in [36] the same authors analysed more detailed configurations
having in mind an analogue gravity setting. The present study reproduces those results
and extends them further, with a more generalised approach in the construction of the
geometries.
To start with, we can use the same formalism as in the previous section,
approximating a spherical distribution of matter with an infinitesimally thin shell.
Following the same scheme as before, we can decide on a shell trajectory and then
see how the ETF behaves, from which we can also guess how the RSET is modified in
the dynamical in vacuum with respect to the Boulware vacuum. Taking, for example,
the trajectory R = rs (1 + e−v− /rs ) we obtain the ETF plotted in fig. 11, which rapidly
tends to zero.
When the ETF tends to zero, it leaves the RSET in the exterior Schwarzschild region
to approach the divergence it has in the Boulware vacuum as the shell approaches rs , as
can be seen clearly from eqs. (7). In the Boulware vacuum, when matter has crossed its
Schwarzschild radius there is a 1/f (r − rs ) type of divergence (with f being the redshift
function) [5, 37]. In this case, as the ETF between the in and Boulware vacua tends to
zero, the values of the RSET for the in vacuum in the exterior r > R region approach
those for the Boulware vacuum. The plot in fig. 11 therefore represents the decreasing
difference in time between the physical RSET and a quantity which at the shell surface
increases as 1/f (R) ∼ 1/(R − rs ) ∼ ev/rs , i.e. exponentially in time.
In fact, it turns out that for any such asymptotic approach of the shell to its
Schwarzschild radius the result is qualitatively the same: an ETF which tends to
zero and an RSET with rapidly increasing values. To understand why this occurs,
we can look at the definition of the ETF in eq. (6), and see that it only has a finite
(constant) asymptotic value if the relation duin /duout is asymptotically an exponential
in uout . Additionally, if the shell has positive mass and is in continual in-fall, then
light rays become more dispersed in time after travelling through it and escaping.
This implies that the asymptotic relation between the coordinates must be of the type
duin /duout ∼ e−kuout , with k > 0. Integrating this relation, we see that uout reaches
infinity for a finite value of uin , i.e. the outgoing light rays need to be trapped inside a
finite spatial region after some moment. The dynamics of an infinitesimally thin shell
cannot trap light rays in such a way without also forming a horizon in finite time, so
a non-zero asymptotic flux of field particles is only obtained when the collapsing shell

mentioned. If the Schwarzschild radius is only reached asymptotically, no light ray ever
gets trapped.
So from this result it may seem that if a distribution of matter approaches the
formation of a horizon only asymptotically, then the exterior vacuum polarisation would
always tend to its values in the Boulware vacuum. However, we cannot generalise the
result obtained for an infinitesimally thin shell in such a way. Very often, shells provide
a good and simple model for collapse scenarios, giving quite similar results to more
realistic models of matter, for instance making any shell a thick one. But when studying
asymptotic results in the vicinity of a horizon, the effect of even the tiniest width for
the shell can change the result entirely, as we will see below. This can be seen as an
interesting illustration of the idea that horizons can act as a magnifying glass of high
energy physics (in this case represented by the detailed structure inside a thin shell).
4.1. Light-ray trapping without horizon formation
Essentially, the reason why the result is different when a finite-volume matter-filled
region is introduced (instead of a thin shell) is because the resulting geometry can trap
light rays inside a finite spatial region without forming an apparent horizon in finite
time, only tending to its formation asymptotically in time. More specifically, in such
a case outgoing light-ray trajectories would remain confined inside the Schwarzschild
radius for an arbitrarily long, or even infinite period of time (as measured by the regular
coordinate vin ), tending to escape only asymptotically in time and thus never doing so.

Figure 12. Conformal diagrams of two spacetimes in which light rays are trapped
inside a finite spatial region. The curves indicate surfaces of constant radius. The
dash-dotted curve is the Schwarzschild radius r = rs . The diagram on the left
represents confinement which only lasts a finite time, without the formation of an event
horizon. The diagram on the right represents confinement which lasts all the way to
the asymptotic future null region, forming an event horizon. These two cases have an
initial region of identical semiclassical (and classical) behaviour. In the second case
an inner Cauchy horizon may also form, resulting in an extendibility of the geometry
analogous to that of an extremal charged black hole.

Fig. 12 shows a conformal diagram of this type of spacetime, for both the case in which
light rays eventually escape as well as the case in which they do not. In terms of the
expansion of these null geodesics, this situation would be characterised by an expansion
which tends to zero at the Schwarzschild radius r = rs only asymptotically in time, as
opposed to the standard black-hole formation scenario, in which it becomes zero after a
finite time. This confined state of the light rays at least gives the ETF the possibility of
having a finite asymptotic value. Whether that cuts off the growing values of the RSET
as the Boulware divergence is approached is another matter still.
To clarify, if this light-trapping behaviour were to be maintained asymptotically,
even if no apparent horizon were formed in finite time, the null surface described
by the first trapped radial ray would in fact become an event horizon. However, by
manipulating the geometry further one could stop this asymptotic tendency at any time
and let the trapped light rays out of their spatial confinement. The interesting thing
is that before one does so, a Hawking-like flux of radiation can be maintained for an
arbitrarily long period of time, without the need to form any sort of horizon. On the
other hand, if this (quasi)thermal flux were slightly different from the case of Hawking
radiation (or absent altogether, as in the thin shell case), the RSET would again tend
to a divergence at the Schwarzschild radius.
To see when each of these possible outcomes actually takes place, we will present
and categorise a large family of spherically-symmetric geometries which trap light rays
while having only an asymptotic tendency to form a horizon. For the complete picture,

Semiclassical gravity effects near horizon formation

consider a spacetime given by an exterior patch of a Schwarzschild geometry and an
interior patch with an arbitrary (spherically-symmetric) distribution of matter, given
by the line element in advanced Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates
ds2 = −f (v, r)dv 2 + 2y(v, r)dvdr + r2 dΩ2 ,

(33)

where f and y are arbitrary functions which depend on the characteristics of the matter
content. The two regions are separated by an in-moving spherical surface located at a
radius R(v). For convenience we will define the coordinate d ≡ r − rs , which is just the
radial distance from the Schwarzschild radius. Outgoing radial light rays in the interior
part of the geometry will follow the trajectories given by the differential equation
d0 (v) =

1 f (v, d + rs )
,
2 y(v, d + rs )

(34)

where 0 denotes the derivative with respect to v. For the exterior geometry y(v, r) = 1
and f (v, r) = f (r) = 1 − rs /r. We will define the generalised redshift function in both
regions as
(
1 − rrs , r > R(v),
F (v, r) ≡ f (v,r)
(35)
, r ≤ R(v).
y(v,r)
In the absence of an apparent horizon, F will be positive everywhere. At the interface
r = R we will assume that it is at least continuous, and that there its value is a minimum
of the function in the radial direction, which tends to zero asymptotically in the temporal
direction. With this setup, it turns out that whether or not light rays get trapped in
the interior region depends only on F at R and its first non-zero spatial derivative on
the interior side. Thus, it is completely independent of the exterior geometry, so we can
afford to be a bit lax with the matching conditions and only require continuity of the
metric for now.
We can expand the generalised redshift function F in a power series in the
coordinate d around the curve dR (v) ≡ R(v) − rs (approaching from the inside, and
assuming analyticity there) and write eq. (34) as
d0 (v) =

1 dR (v)
+ k1 [dR (v) − d(v)] + k2 [dR (v) − d(v)]2 + · · · ,
2 rs + dR (v)

(36)

where the first term ensures continuity with the metric in the exterior Schwarzschild
region. The coefficients ki can, in principle, also be variable in time, but we will focus
on cases in which the first non-vanishing one remains constant (or sufficiently close) at
large times. Since we will only focus on asymptotic solutions, its possible early-time
variability and the values of the higher order coefficients will not be relevant.
We will define three categories for the possible functions dR (v), covering all
monotonous asymptotic approximations to the d = 0 surface (the Schwarzschild radius).
Then we will see the most general conditions the coefficients ki must satisfy in each case
for light rays to get trapped.

We have said that the redshift function F has a minimum at dR , so km > 0. The value
of m can be thought of as a measure of the width of this minimum (on the inside), as
the larger it is, the smoother the function becomes around dR . In the limit m → ∞ it
becomes constant in d at equal times, making its approach
to zero extend to all points

of the interior region. Each of these radial points would then mark an asymptotic
marginally trapped surface.
In order to look for trapped solutions (remaining inside d < 0 but close to dR at
large times), we have to make some assumption about their asymptotic behaviour. If
we assume that the (−d)m term dominates on the rhs of (38), we obtain that if

which, compared to the previous solutions through the inequality (39) can be seen to
be asymptotically closer to d = 0, and therefore corresponds to the first trapped light
ray. All light rays passing through the distribution of matter in a radial direction after
the one which has the above asymptotic solution become trapped inside.
Exponential approach: We now consider a surface trajectory of the type
dR (v) = rs e−γv ,

with γ real and positive.

(42)

In this case we have the same differential equation (38), only with exponentials instead
of polynomials. If the degree m of the first non-zero term in the expansion is strictly
greater than 1, then the solution which is asymptotically below d = 0 but gets closest to
it, i.e. the first trapped ray, can be obtained by assuming that the rhs of the equation
is dominated by terms of order e−γv . The result is
rs
d ∼ − e−γv .
(43)

On the other hand, if m = 1, then asymptotically we must consider the terms with
e−γv and d(v) in the differential equation. Then it turns out that there are asymptotic
trapped solutions only if
γ > k1 .

Their expressions up to order e−γv are

where again c is an integration constant. The first trapped light ray corresponds to
c = 0, while subsequent trapped ones correspond to values c < 0. The limit c → 0+
corresponds to the last escaping ray.
Super-exponential approach: If dR (v) approaches zero faster than an exponential (e.g.
a Gaussian), then light rays are trapped for any m ≥ 1. The first trapped solution is
asymptotically proportional to the integral of dR (v) (the error function for a Gaussian).

Semiclassical gravity effects near horizon formation

4.2. Asymptotic temperature
Having seen a quite general family of geometries for which escaping light rays do
get trapped, we can now connect them with the outside and check how semiclassical
effects behave around the Schwarzschild radius, where an apparent horizon is formed
asymptotically. At first, we will allow a discontinuity in the first derivatives of the metric
components at the surface R and see what values the ETF takes. After that we will
consider a case in which the transition is smoothed out (with zero spatial derivatives
for F on both sides of its minimum, making it behave like the redshift function in an
extremal charged black-hole formation process) and see how the result changes.
Let us first trace the trajectories of the light rays in the exterior geometry, from
the moment in which they cross the surface located at R (at the escape time vet ) until
they reach future null infinity, and explain how the ETF is calculated. To label the
specific light rays at future infinity, we will use the parameter v∞ given by the origin of
the asymptotic straight line which the ray tends to follow, as can be seen by looking at
fig. 15. Integrating the outgoing null geodesic equation in the Schwarzschild region, we
can obtain this parameter as a function of the surface point,
v∞ = vet − 2R(vet ) − 2rs log[R(vet ) − rs ].

(46)

When a horizon is formed in finite regular time (and remains present forever), v∞
diverges as the argument of the logarithm tends to zero, while the rest of the terms
vet − 2R(vet ) remain finite and negligible. Then,
R(vet ) − rs ∼ e−v∞ /2rs ,
= 1/2rs is simply the multiplicative constant in this exponential
and the ETF κuuout
in
when the other term (in this case R(vet ) − rs ) tends to a simple zero. In this case we
see that the internal structure of the collapsing matter distribution is not in any way
reflected in the asymptotic ETF, hence why the Hawking temperature of black holes
depends only on their Schwarzschild radius.
On the other hand, when a horizon is formed asymptotically, both the logarithm
and vet diverge on the rhs of (46). If they both diverge logarithmically, then the ETF
is modified and can now reflect some of the characteristics of the interior geometric
structure. If either of them diverges hyperbolically, then the ETF shuts down altogether,
tending to zero roughly as 1/v∞ .
This last behaviour is precisely what occurs in the case for the sub-exponential
approach of the surface to the Schwarzschild radius, in which vet in (46) diverges
hyperbolically. When the ETF tends to zero, the RSET on the surface approaches
its Boulware divergence, as was the case for the infinitesimal shell.
For the case of the exponential approach, the result is the first of the abovementioned: both terms in (46) diverge logarithmically. For k1 6= 0 (and γ > k1 , as
is necessary for light rays to be trapped), the contribution of each divergence (in the

(48)

which is always less than the Hawking temperature, approaching it only in the γ → ∞
limit (an infinitely quick collapse). If k1 = 0, the result is the same as the above taking
k1 → 0, also making the lower bound on the possible values of γ zero.
Lastly, for the case of the super-exponential approach to the Schwarzschild radius,
the dominant divergence in (46) is a logarithmic one with the same coefficient as in the
case of horizon formation in finite time, leading to an asymptotic Hawking temperature
with the same value. As an example, let us consider a surface trajectory of the type
n

dR = rs e−(γv) ,

with n ≥ 2.

(49)

Then the diverging terms in v∞ corresponding to vet and the logarithm are respectively
1
[log()]1/n − 2rs log(),

so the dominant divergence is simply the same logarithm as in the Hawking case.
We can therefore say that if a collapse is sufficiently quick, then, as far as longterm semiclassical effects above the horizon are concerned, there is no difference from the
case of the formation of a black hole in finite time: the Boulware divergence is canceled
out and there is a flux of Hawking radiation. On the other hand, if the collapse is
slower, then the asymptotic ETF decreases according to the speed of collapse and to

one particular characteristic of the internal structure: the first spatial derivative of F
at the surface. We can say that anything further in this region remains invisible to the
ETF, just as the whole structure was invisible for a quicker collapse. For a sufficiently
slow collapse, when the ETF becomes zero, the internal structure again becomes hidden
asymptotically, only this time the semiclassical effects become indistinguishable not from
the case of a dynamic black-hole formation, but from the case of a static black hole.
4.3. A smooth transition: the extremal black hole
Up to this point we have considered a generalised redshift function F with a minimum
which has a discontinuity in the first derivative, as is seen in fig. 13. The slope on
the outside has always been finite, given by the derivative of the Schwarzschild redshift
function, and has appeared implicitly in the calculations through the quantity rs . For
the slope on the inside we have analysed the cases in which it may be finite or zero.
We will now explore the case in which both the slope on the inside and on the
outside of the minimum may be zero. Particularly, we will modify the external static
geometry being revealed beyond the surface R(v) in such a way that the slope (and
subsequent derivatives) on the outside can have an arbitrary value at horizon formation,
maintaining however an asymptotically Schwarzschild structure, as shown in fig. 16. We
are going to show that, in accordance with the results in [36], the asymptotic ETF will
be zero if the slope on the outside is zero, even for an exponential approach of R to the
horizon.
To show this, let us trace the trajectories of light rays in this new exterior geometry,
from the moment in which they cross R (at the escape time vet ). For the region close
to rs , we can write the differential equation which governs their movement as a power

distance dR (v) in (36) for the interior geometry),

(51)

If the exterior geometry is static, then the coefficients ki are constant, although for
our purposes we will only need the first non-zero one to be asymptotically constant,
similarly to our previous calculations for the interior region. Let us call this first nonzero coefficient km , so that the light rays close to d = 0 will move according to
d0 (v) ' km d(v)m .

(52)

For a Schwarzschild exterior km = k1 = 1/(2rs ). In general, if m = 1 then the solutions
of the above equation are
d(v) ' dR (vet )ek1 (v−vet )
(53)
for rays crossing the surface at dR (vet ) = R(vet ) − rs . On the other hand, for m > 1 the
solutions are

When the exterior geometry was Schwarzschild, we calculated light-ray dispersion
through the variation in the quantity v∞ , defined from the integration of null trajectories
through the whole exterior region, up to infinity. We did so because this parameter
offered the most obvious relation with the label uout which is used to define the out
vacuum state (they are in fact proportional to each other). However, to calculate the
ETF we only need to study the divergent part of the dispersion, which occurs long
before the light rays reach infinity. In fact, for the behaviour of the ETF at large times
we only need to trace their trajectories up to an arbitrarily small distance ε away from
the surface where the horizon forms asymptotically, i.e. up to rs + ε.
We will define a new parameter vε as the moment light rays cross the rs + ε surface
(which is always outside the surface R(v) at large enough times), as shown in fig. 17.
This parameter will take the place of v∞ in the study of the divergence in the dispersion
of the trajectories of light rays which get arbitrarily close to the first trapped one. For
the above solutions with m = 1 we have

where the second relation shows that at large times, so long as ε is finite, the value of vε
is in fact independent from this distance parameter. Approaching the last escaping light
rays we have dR (vet ) → 0 and vet → ∞. From the results in the previous subsection, we
know that if the divergence in vet is logarithmic or quicker, then the ETF has a finite
asymptotic value. On the other hand, if vet diverges more slowly, then the ETF shuts
down.

(56)

In this case, no matter how quickly vet diverges, the parameter vε always has a dominant
hyperbolic divergence, making the ETF shut down asymptotically in time as 1/vε .
This result shows that if this slope of F on the outside is asymptotically zero, then
the ETF tends to zero even for an arbitrarily quick collapse. Consequently, the RSET
in the in vacuum tends to its values in the Boulware vacuum, approaching a divergence
as F tends to zero. This case should not be confused with the one of the thin shell
approaching the Schwarzschild radius asymptotically, as although the ETF and RSET
have the same asymptotic behaviour, light rays behave quite differently (in one case
they get trapped and in the other they do not).
A more similar case in which semiclassical effects have the same long-term behaviour
is that of a spacetime in which an extremal charged black hole forms in finite time. In
it, the generalised redshift function has a smooth minimum (with zero slope on both
sides) which, unlike in our model, reaches zero in finite time (and stays at zero from
then on). In this case there is again an absence of an asymptotic flux of particles at
future null infinity [38, 39].
5. Horizon formation at different velocities
Up to this point we have analysed the consequences of staying in the region of large
gradient in fig. 5 outside the Schwarzschild radius, but approaching it asymptotically.
We have also considered a variation of this problem involving a more general distribution
of matter. The final step in our study is to see exactly what happens when the
Schwarzschild radius is crossed in finite null time. Particularly, we have already shown
for this case that the asymptotic ETF is always 1/2rs , and it is a well-known fact that
this provides an additional term in the RSET with respect to its Boulware vacuum value
that precisely regularises the divergence at the horizon [8].

Semiclassical gravity effects near horizon formation

32

In this section we will be interested in semiclassical effects produced in a finite time
interval around the formation of a horizon by a shell collapsing at different velocities
lower than the speed of light at the moment of crossing the horizon. Past studies in this
direction, although detailed, have usually involved only a shell collapsing at light-speed
(e.g. [40]), justified by the fact that during astrophysical black-hole formation, the
velocity of falling matter is expected to be high when crossing the horizon. By contrast,
as mentioned earlier, the goal of this work is to thoroughly study the semiclassical effects
produced in more general dynamical situations.
Since in this case the asymptotic solutions for both the ETF and RSET are known,
we will be more interested in short-term dynamical effects. At horizon formation, large
values of the RSET are to be expected if the in vacuum approximates the static Boulware
vacuum in some way (say, in the case of a very slow collapse). Therefore, it is at the
horizon itself where we might expect the most clear estimate of how large semiclassical
effects can become. We will thus be interested in obtaining the total values of the RSET
components there. To give them a more physical interpretation, we will also calculate
the corresponding values of the vacuum energy density and the radial pressure measured
by free-falling observers.
5.1. Conformal factor at the horizon
In order to obtain the values of the RSET in the in vacuum, we need to calculate the
conformal factor C(uin , vin ) which allows us to write the part of the metric (1) restricted
to the time-radius subspace, in the uin , vin null coordinates,
ds2(2) = −C(uin , vin )duin dvin .

(57)

Just as a reminder, the in vacuum state of the dimensionally reduced problem is defined
by the plane waves in the asymptotic Minkowski region at past null infinity, which is
entirely within the asymptotic region of the exterior Schwarzschild geometry if the shell
never reaches the speed of light in the past. The ingoing modes, labelled by vin , either
fall directly into the singularity or are reflected at the origin r− = 0 and from there either
escape before the formation of the horizon and reach future null infinity, or fall into the
singularity. If they reach future null infinity, they can be labelled by the coordinate uout ,
the value of which is a function of the previous label vin . Any point in the geometry
outside the event horizon (both on the exterior and interior of the shell) can be labelled
by a pair (uout , vin ). In the notation introduced in eqs. (8) and (10), vin is simply v+
and uout is u+ . The dispersion of the light rays between past and future null infinity is
given by
du+ dv−
g(u− )
duout

(58)

h(u− )
where we have made use of the relation du− = dv− for the reflection of light rays at the
origin, and where u− is a function of vin through the inverse of the integral of h(u− ).
Studying the values of g(u− ) and h(v− ), defined in (13), from −∞ until the formation

Semiclassical gravity effects near horizon formation

33

of the horizon for different trajectories of collapse, one can see that h is of order one
throughout. On the other hand, g always has a divergence at the horizon since u+
reaches an infinite value while u− is still finite. The contrast in this behaviour implies
that the approximation
dv−
' 1,
(59)
dvin
that is, the approximation of considering our vin coordinate as the Minkowski v− ,
captures the relevant physical effects produced in the dynamics around the formation of
the horizon. It is easy to check that introducing a function h which is different from 1,
but of the same order of magnitude, would not change the general aspects of the results.
This approximation, apart from simplifying the calculations which follow, also allows us
to fix the trajectory of the shell only in an arbitrarily small region around the point of
horizon-crossing.
From this point on we will drop the subscripts from the two null coordinates we
will use for the most part: v ≡ v+ and u ≡ u− (we will not use uout since it is divergent
at the horizon). Also, we will mostly use the radial coordinate in the exterior region, so
r will always refer to r+ .
From equations (10) and (13) we see that the conformal factor of the dimensionally
reduced geometry as a function of u and v is
C(u, v) = |f (r(u, v))|g(u).

(60)

Since we are interested in calculating the RSET at the horizon, where large values
might be expected for it, we must evaluate the above quantity and at least its first two
derivatives there. A minor inconvenience in that process is the fact that the explicit
form of r(u, v) is not generally available, and numerical calculations cannot be relied
upon either, since at the horizon f is zero and g diverges. To handle this difficulty, we
will use an expansion for r(u, v) around the line corresponding to the horizon, where
u = uh = const.,
1
r(u, v) = q0 (v) + q1 (v)(u − uh ) + q2 (v)(u − uh )2 + · · · ,
2

(61)

where qi is the i-th derivative of r with respect to u evaluated at uh , namely, qi =
∂ i r/∂ui |u=uh . In order to calculate the RSET components, we will need up to second
derivatives of the conformal factor in u. To evaluate them we must use the expansion
of r(u, v) in u up to third order, due to the 1/(u − uh ) divergence generally present in
g(u). This means that we need only q0 , . . . , q3 .
Let us now see how to calculate these coefficients. The lowest order one q0 (v) is
just the value of r at the horizon, namely, the constant rs = 2M . The rest of them can
be obtained through the relations
∂r

(62)

as we show in the following. The first of these equations evaluated at uh gives q1 (v),
but its rhs is just as difficult to evaluate as the conformal factor itself. However, we can
make use of the second equation to write the cross-derivative

(63)

Taking into account that f 0 (r) evaluated at the horizon is just 1/rs , the evaluation
of this equation at uh gives us a first order differential equation for q1 (v), namely
q10 (v) = q1 (v)/(2rs ). Using this method recursively allows us to write analogous
equations for all the coefficients qi (v) in (61). For the ones relevant to our calculation
of the RSET we obtain

Initial conditions for these equations can be found by fixing the zero of the v coordinate
at the point of horizon formation, and considering the relation r+ = r− at the surface
of the shell.
For a shell which crosses the horizon with an approximately constant radial velocity
as seen from the inside (α− = dv− /du− ' const.), from equations (9) and (12) we get
the relation

the important aspects of our final results do not change if they have different values).

5.2. RSET evaluated at the horizon for the “in” vacuum
We now have everything prepared to calculate the RSET components at the horizon.
Substituting the solutions (66) into the series expansion (61), we see how f depends on
u and v up to third order in (u − uh ). As for resolving the dependence of g in r (which
appears through α+ ), we must remember the definition of this function (13) which tells
us that it is evaluated at the shell surface. Therefore, close to the horizon, we can simply

use the expression for r given in (65). With these functions we can obtain C(u, v) up
to second order in (u − uh ) (remember g has a leading term 1/(u − uh )),

Their behaviour can be read easily, except perhaps for the first constant term in the
parenthesis in hTuu i, which has been plotted as a function of α− in fig. 18. The following
observations can be made:
• Firstly, the components seem to grow exponentially on the horizon as time passes.
This, however, turns out to be a consequence of the coordinate system in which they
are expressed. In a system more appropriate for the static Schwarzschild region, say
the Eddington-Finkelstein advanced coordinates (v, r), this behaviour is suppressed
by factors of 1/C arising from the relation ∂u/∂r. A more detailed analysis of the
energy density and flux perceived by a free-falling observer will follow shortly.
• The second thing one might notice is that hTvv i is constant, and therefore completely
independent from the dynamics of the collapse. This is an obvious consequence of
the fact that we have chosen the Eddington-Finkelstein v coordinate, which is not
affected by the interior Minkowski region.
• Finally, we note that the hTuu i component diverges as α− → 1, that is, as
the collapse becomes slower, approaching the static limit. As we will see, the
1/(1−α− )n terms are suppressed exponentially in the regular Eddington-Finkelstein
coordinates when a long time has passed since the formation of the horizon, but
they play an important role near the point of horizon formation.
5.3. Energy density, flux and pressure observed by free-falling observer at the horizon
Let us consider the four-velocity w of a free-falling observer in the Schwarzschild
geometry expressed in (u, v) coordinates, evaluated at the moment of horizon crossing.

As an aside, we note that the conformal factor at the horizon,
C(uh , v) = (1 − α− )ev/2rs ,

(73)

is not equal to 1 when v = 0, where the geometry must match with the interior
Minkowski region, because we are not using the Minkowski v− coordinate. If we were,
we would have to multiply C by h = dv+ /dv− , which at the point of horizon formation
has the value h = 1/(1 − α− )).

We thus see that the growing exponentials appearing in eqs. (68) do not show up in
the scalar quantities in (72). In fact, these turn out to have constant, finite asymptotic
values that depend on the initial condition β0 of the free falling observer

When these values are approximately reached, the system can be said to have
thermalised, as all other terms are suppressed exponentially. A measure of the time
it takes to do so, in the v coordinate, for a slow collapse (when α− is close to 1) is given
by the value

In fig. 19 we see plots for ρ, Φ and p for two different values of β0 , which make the
asymptotic values of ρ and p have different signs. Except for the case of extremely small
values of β0 , the asymptotic values of the previous quantities are always negligibly small
due to the suppression of the RSET by Planck’s constant (which has been omitted in
the choice of units). However, this smallness can be compensated during the transient
phase of the collapse. Near the point of horizon formation we have 1/(1 − α− )4
terms, originating from the 1/(1 − α− )2 term in hTuu i in (68) and from the 1/C 2 term
evaluated from (73). These terms can be made arbitrarily large if α− is very close to 1,
compensating the suppression by Planck’s constant.
With these results we see that the RSET approaches a physical divergence in the
static limit α− → 1. At the limit itself this divergence is hardly surprising, as for a
static shell the in vacuum essentially becomes the Boulware one. What is interesting
is the fact that this limit can be approached through the single velocity parameter α−
of the shell when it crosses the horizon, without imposing any conditions on its past
evolution. This seems to indicate that during the formation of a black hole, if by some
mechanism the collapse of matter were to be slowed down just before it forms a horizon,
its subsequent evolution would become a problem which requires a full semiclassical
treatment.
6. Summary and conclusions
In the standard picture of a black-hole formation process, the pressure of a star fails to
support its structure and matter begins to accelerate in an inward direction, acquiring
very high speeds by the time a horizon is formed. In this scenario, the semiclassical
theory presents no significant deviations from its classical counterpart [8, 9, 10, 11].
This is true throughout the collapse, except perhaps when the curvature approaches

Figure 19. Perceived energy density, flux and pressure at the horizon, as a function
of the Eddington-Finkelstein v coordinate, for β0 = 0.5 (free fall from r0 → ∞) and
for β0 = 30 (free fall from r0 ' 1.017rs ), in the Schwarzschild region of a collapse with
parameter α− = 0.9 (vtherm ' 9.2rs ). The point v = 0 marks the formation of the
horizon. Immediately after, we observe these function have very large (negative) values.
This is a direct consequence of the proximity of the parameter α− to 1, as discussed
in the text. On the other hand, the asymptotic values are always small (except for
observers which start their free fall very close to the horizon, where β → ∞). The sign
of the asymptotic energy density and pressure depend of the velocity of the observer
(they are negative for slower observers), while the outgoing flux is always positive, in
accordance with the evaporating black-hole scenario.

Planckian values, in the final stages before a singularity is formed, although it is not
clear whether the semiclassical theory is applicable there at all. However, whether
semiclassical effects become important in scenarios involving matter approaching the
formation of a horizon in a different manner is less well understood, and worth studying
in detail in order to determine the possible self-consistency of models of gravitational
collapse beyond general relativity.
Our study is inspired by the possible behaviour of matter in such situations, covering
nonetheless a very large family of geometries due to the many unknowns in their
evolution. In section 3 we begun by analysing the case of an oscillating distribution
of matter in the thin-shell approximation, which periodically approaches the formation
of a horizon but bounces back just before it is formed. Through the ETF we saw periods
of emission of Hawking-like radiation in between the bounces. Although the ETF in
these periods was always around the Hawking value 1/2rs , its particular shape was
strongly influenced by how the in-crossing and out-crossing dispersion effects resonated
with each other for individual modes. The bounces themselves caused a significant

Semiclassical gravity effects near horizon formation

39

dispersion in the out-crossing modes, which translates into sharp increases of both the
ETF and RSET. In general, we saw that semiclassical quantities (which depend on
the derivatives of the terms measuring light-ray dispersion) become largest near the
Schwarzschild radius at low speeds.
To further explore this low-velocity regime, in section 4 we analysed surface
trajectories which approach the Schwarzschild radius monotonously, but reach it only
asymptotically. In this case we saw that semiclassical effects are very sensitive to
the structure of the geometry close to the surface, so we needed to go beyond the
thin-shell approximation and use an arbitrary spherically-symmetric geometry for the
interior. With minimal assumptions, we showed that the values of the ETF and RSET
at large times depend only on a few characteristics of the geometry through one of its
degrees of freedom, which we called the generalised redshift function, particularly: the
speed at which its minimum approaches zero (i.e. the speed at which the formation
of an apparent horizon is approached) and its spatial derivatives on both sides of this
minimum. Depending on these quantities, the dynamical in vacuum can behave as in
the usual case of black-hole formation in finite time, or it can become similar to the
static Boulware vacuum (generally at lower speeds of approach). In the latter case
the RSET acquires very large values around the Schwarzschild radius, tending to a
divergence asymptotically.
In section 5 we went back to the thin-shell approximation, and analysed the case
of a trajectory which forms a horizon in finite time. The parameter we were interested
in was the speed at which the shell crossed the Schwarzschild radius. We calculated
the values of the RSET at the horizon, and the corresponding energy density, flux and
pressure perceived by free-falling observers, with a dependence on this speed parameter.
We saw that at low speeds these physical quantities can become arbitrarily large (and
also stay large for longer at lower speeds), approaching a divergence in the static limit.
To conclude, we remark that a clear-cut result from all the above situations is
that semiclassical back-reaction on the geometry (through the RSET) is a necessary
ingredient in analysing any geometry in which matter happens to be moving at very low
velocities (much lower than the speed of light) when close to horizon formation. As a
purely kinematic exercise, our analysis shows the richness of the situations around the
threshold of horizon formation. Beyond that, although no complete dynamical scenario
has yet been developed in which matter actually enters such low-velocity regimes, it
is important to note that such a possibility is not excluded either. This offers the
exploration of alternative scenarios with which to compare the standard black-hole
paradigm.
