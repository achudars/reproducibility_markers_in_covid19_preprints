We generalize the celebrated heavy quark expansion to nonlocal QCD operators. By taking nonlocal heavy-light current on the light-cone as an example, we confirm that the collinear singularities
are common between QCD operator and the corresponding operator in heavy quark effective theory
(HQET), at the leading power of 1/M expansion. Based on a perturbative calculation in operator
form at one-loop level, a factorization formula linking QCD and HQET operators is investigated
and the matching coefficient is determined. The matching between QCD and HQET light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) as well as other momentum distributions of hadron can be derived
as a consequence.

Hadrons are multi-scale strong interaction systems.
Heavy hadron—the hydrogen atom of strong interaction, plays an unique role of understanding and examining quantum chromodynamics (QCD). When one of the
quarks in a hadron is heavy comparing with strong interaction scale, i.e., M ≫ ΛQCD , the hard scale M is expected to disentangle from the infrared scale. This leads
to the heavy quark effective theory (HQET) [1–3], which
has proved an effective approach of studying heavy flavor
hadrons, especially in B-meson physics. For a review of
HQET, see Refs. [4, 5].
The HQET action can be derived by expanding the
QCD action in series of the inverse powers of M , which
is known as the heavy quark expansion (HQE). The HQE
for local composite operators is also extensively explored.
For example, consider the heavy-light axial-vector current q̄γ µ γ 5 Q, its HQE gives
q̄γ µ γ 5 Q = C(M, µ)q̄γ µ γ 5 hv + O(1/M ),

(1)

where q̄ is light quark, Q is the heavy quark field in QCD,
while hv is the heavy quark field in HQET, with velocity index v. A matching coefficient C(M, µ) is introduced due to the different ultraviolet (UV) behavior of
the full and effective theories. The matching coefficient
can be calculated in perturbation theory, while the infrared physics is only enclosed in the operators. This
relation holds at operator level, so the matching equation as well as the matching coefficient are independent
of hadron states.
Even in local field theories, one can construct not only
local composite operators, but also nonlocal operators.
In QCD and its effective theories, the nonlocal operators are crucial for understanding inner structure of
hadrons. One important type of such operators are the
bilocal quark operators q̄(z)[z, 0]ΓQ(0), in which the two
quark fields are located on the light-cone (i.e., z 2 = 0 but
z 6= 0), with µ being the renormalization scale that defines the operator. The parton momentum distributions
in a hadron, e.g., parton distribution functions (PDFs)

and light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs), are defined through the matrix elements of light-cone operators. These distributions are indispensable ingredients
for QCD factorization theorems. For example, for many
B-meson exclusive decay processes, the decay amplitude
can be factorized in terms of hard scattering kernel and
B-meson LCDAs [6–12], where the B-meson LCDAs are
defined by the matrix elements of heavy-light operators
on the light-cone in HQET [13]. The other case is that
the two parton fields are separated off the light-cone. The
space-like operators attract lots of attentions in the past
few years, thanks to the development of large momentum effective theory [14, 15] and many other approaches
designed for accessing parton physics from lattice calculation, e.g., pseudo-PDFs [16, 17] and lattice crosssections [18, 19].
When the heavy quark mass M ≫ ΛQCD , analogous to
local operators, the bilocal operators are also expected to
be factorized into hard functions and HQET bilocal operators. The matching for the first inverse moment of
LCDAs in QCD and HQET was derived in Ref. [20].
A factorization theorem for LCDAs was proposed recently [21], which connects B-meson LCDAs defined in
QCD and HQET, based on the perturbative calculation
on the LCDAs of heavy-light mesons [22]. In this work,
we will focus on the operators instead of the momentum distributions, because factorization holds at operator level, taking matrix elements and Fourier transforms
are irrelevant for establishing a factorization theorem.
The goal of this work is to derive the HQE for nonlocal
QCD operators, or in other words, the nonlocal generalization of Eq. (1). Without loss of generality, we will
study the HQE for the nonlocal heavy-light current in
which two quark fields are separated on the light-cone,
similar discussions might be easily generalized to other
nonlocal operators. Based on the factorization formula in
the operator form, the factorization for B-meson LCDAs
and other structure functions can be naturally derived.
In QCD, a gauge invariant nonlocal light-cone operator
composed by a light quark field and a heavy quark field
can be expressed as q̄(z)[z, 0]ΓQ(0), where q̄(z) denotes
the light-quark with mass m, and M is the mass of the
R1
heavy quark field Q(0), [z, 0] ≡ P exp[igs 0 dλz · A(λz)]

2
is a Wilson line located on the light-cone. The position
of light quark is z = z − n, with n being a unit light-cone
vector, n2 = 0. Γ is a certain Lorentz structure. For the
sake of simplicity, we consider a special case O(z, 0) ≡
q̄(z)[z, 0]/
nγ 5 Q(0), which corresponds to the leading twist
LCDA of B-meson. The corresponding HQET operator
e 0; v) ≡ q̄(z)[z, 0]/
is denoted as O(z,
nγ 5 hv (0), where hv
is the heavy quark field in HQET, related to the large
component of Q under M → ∞ limit, v (v 2 = 1) is
the velocity vector of heavy quark. hv is constrained by
v/hv = hv and equation of motion v · D hv = 0.
When the heavy quark mass M is large, the heavy
quark and QCD Lagrangian can be expanded in series of
1/M . The full heavy quark field Q is expressed by the
effective heavy quark field hv as (see, e.g., Refs. [4, 5])

with the help of Eq. (2). The operators with superscript

If the radiative corrections are included, however, HQE
will generally modify the UV behavior. Taking M → ∞
in radiative correction of O(z, 0) cannot be reduced to
O(z, 0; v) when ultraviolet (UV) singularities exist, then
a matching is needed. Because the matching is related to
hard scale M , the matching coefficient can be evaluated
in perturbation theory. When the interaction is included,
the position of quarks will be generally shifted, which
means that HQE of O(z, 0) will be a superposition of
O(ᾱz, βz; v), with 0 < β < ᾱ < 1. The HQE formula
proposed in this work is

where t ≡ v · z − i0, ᾱ ≡ 1 − α. C(α, β, t, M, µ, µ
e; αs ) is
the matching coefficient, which can be evaluated in perturbation theory. To confirm the matching formula and
evaluate the matching coefficient, one should first calculate the radiative corrections of both QCD and HQET
operators.
Since the nonlocal operator is defined in position space, it is natural to perform calculation in
coordinate-representation. Furthermore, the coordinaterepresentation calculation can be done in operator form.
We work in D = 4−2ǫ dimensions so that the UV and soft

singularities are regularized in dimensional regularization
(DR). The light-quark mass m serves as the regulator for
the collinear (mass) singularity.
The radiative corrections to operator O(z, 0) involve
UV singularity, so the operator should be renormalized
first. Here we adopt the modified minimal subtraction (MS) scheme. The renormalization group equation
(RGE) for O(z, 0, µ) is [23]

with T (u) denoting a test function. It indicates that
under renormalization, the nonlocal operator will get
mixed with all the operators of the same type but with
smaller separation between two quarks. By taking the
forward hadron-to-hadron or meson-to-vacuum matrix
elements and performing Fourier transform, this equation
will be reduced to the nonsinglet part of the DokshizerGribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi equation for PDFs [24–
26], or the Efremov-Radyushkin-Brodsky-Lepage equation for LCDAs [27–29], respectively [30]. Recently the
evolution of light-cone operators are known up to threeloops [31–34].

on-shell renormalization constants for q and Q, respectively. The second term in Eq. (10) is from the interaction between light quark and Wilson line, while the
third term is from heavy quark—Wilson line interaction.
The last two terms are from light quark—heavy quark
interaction. Note that there is a scheme dependence on
the treatment of γ 5 in DR: one is the naive DR scheme
that γ 5 anti-commutes with all γ µ [35]; another choice is
the ’t Hooft-Veltman scheme [36, 37], in which γ 5 anticommutes with γ µ for µ = 0, 1, 2, 3 but commutes with γ µ
for µ = 4, · · · , d − 1. Without loss of generality, we simply adopt naive scheme in this work. We also note that
ǫIR is not expanded at this stage, because the existence of
soft singularities located at α = β = 0. Such expansion
is only safe when the soft singularities are isolated (e.g.,
by introducing plus-prescriptions for the integrals).
Our result in Eq. (10) is valid for arbitrary m and M .
To compare with previous result on LCDA for mesons
with non-equal quark masses (e.g., K and Bc ), one can
sandwich the operator O(z, 0, µ) between vacuum and the
lowest Fock state, then Fourier transform to momentum
space. By recalling Eq. (8), this is equivalent to a convolution between K and δ(x − ᾱu0 − β ū0 ). With the kernel
given in Eq. (7), and eliminating the contribution from
decay constant, we will arrive at the result for LCDA,
which was firstly calculated by Bell and Feldmann [22]
and later further explored in NRQCD re-factorization
approach [38, 39]. Another special case is u0 = 1/2, i.e.,
m = M , then Eq. (10) describes the one-loop correction
to the operator with equal quark masses, which can be
used to mesons like π 0 and ηc , etc.
Since the topic of this work is the matching of heavylight operator, what we are interested in is the M → ∞
limit. After some efforts, we arrive at

culated in the same manner with QCD case. We denote
e 0; v) ≡ q̄(z)[z, 0]/
HQET operator as O(z,
nγ5 hv (0), and
add a tilde upon other related variables to distinguish
from the QCD ones. We adopt the MS scheme again for
renormalization. Unlike the QCD case, there is a 1/ǫ2UV
UV divergence. In HQET, the heavy quark is described
by a Wilson line along the v-direction. The interaction
between the v- and n-Wilson lines generates a cusp singularity, therefore light-cone singularity and cusp singularity appear simultaneously and leads to the 1/ǫ2UV -pole.
The cusp singularity and corresponding cusp anomalous
dimension was computed at two-loop order long time
ago [40, 41] and recently has been known up to threeloops [42, 43]. The light quark—Wilson line interaction
contributes equally to both QCD and HQET operators.
The heavy quark—light quark interaction is UV finite.

If the anomalous dimension from decay constant is

The first term arises from the interaction between the
heavy quark and Wilson line. A similar result in which
the collinear divergence is regularized in DR was reported
in Refs. [47, 48]. In Eq. (15) the 1/ǫ and 1/ǫ2 poles
have already been subtracted in MS. We note that to
reproduce the LCDA in Ref. [22] one should perform the
Fourier transform before subtracting the 1/ǫi poles, during to the ln it singularities. In contrast to QCD, the
HQET nonlocal operator is non-analytic when z → 0 because of the logarithmic and double-logarithmic dependence on t, therefore can not approach to local operator
smoothly, and the local OPE does not exist [49]. The
singularities at z → 0 also lead to the 1/ω behavior in
B-meson LCDA φ+
B (ω) at ω → ∞.
With the one-loop corrections to QCD and HQET operators, we are now able to see how factorization formula
Eq. (4) works. Since the matching coefficient is calculable in perturbation theory, one can expand it in series of
αs
C(α, β,t, M, µ, µ
e; αs ) = C (0) (α, β)

αs CF (1)
C (α, β, t, M, µ, µ
e) + O(α2s ).
2π

(16)

At tree-level, the QCD and HQET operators are same, so
the factorization formula Eq. (4) holds and the tree-level
matching coefficient is simply C0 (α, β) = δ(α)δ(β).
The one-loop matching coefficient can be extracted by
comparing the O(αs ) terms on the both sides of Eq. (4),
the result is

C (1) (α, β, t, M, µ, µ
e) =K (1) (α, β, m, M, µ)e−iMβt
e (1) (α, β, m, t, µ
−K
e).
(17)
The reason for the phase factor e−iMβt is following: the
radiative correction changes the location of heavy quark
in QCD operator from 0 to βz, then according to Eq. (2),
the heavy quark in QCD and HQET is related by a phase
factor e−iMβt at leading order of 1/M expansion, this
phase factor finally enters the matching coefficient. In
momentum representation, it turns the residue momentum of heavy-quark to the total momentum.
By recalling Eqs. (11), (15) and (17), one can evaluate
the matching coefficient at one-loop level, the value reads

One can see that the collinear divergences in QCD and
HQET operators, which are represented by ln m2 , are
canceled. The matching coefficient C (1) (α, β, t, M, µ, µ
e)
is free of collinear and soft singularities, indicating that
the factorization also holds at one-loop level. By sandwiching the both sides of matching equation between vacuum and meson sates, then performing Fourier transforms that demanded by the definitions of LCDAs, one
can get the matching formula for B-meson LCDAs defined in QCD and HQET, which has been addressed in
Ref. [21]. However, the full result for QCD operator,
Eq. (10), can not be matched onto HQET, because the
ln m2 terms in Eqs. (10) and (15) do not match. This
indicates that the factorization only holds at the leading
power of 1/M expansion.
We also note that only the n
/ γ 5 component of axialcurrent is considered in this paper. If the analysis is performed for all the components, i.e., γ µ γ 5 , Lorentz struc-

(18)

tures like z µ γ 5 and many others will enter the expansion
formula. HQE for a general current will be a straightforward generalization of this work.
In summary, we have generalized the heavy quark expansion to nonlocal heavy-light current on the light-cone.
Based on a perturbative calculation in operator form, we
confirm up to one-loop accuracy that the QCD nonlocal heavy-light current can be matched onto the corresponding HQET operator by a factorization theorem. All
soft singularities are canceled, both for QCD and HQET
operators; while the collinear singularities are common
and can be canceled between QCD and HQET operators.
The matching coefficient is determined at one-loop and
leading power of 1/M expansion, which does not involve
any infrared scale. The matching between leading twist
LCDAs defined in QCD and HQET can be derived by
taking matrix elements and Fourier transforms. The results presented in this paper might be useful to resum the

5
large logarithms of Q/M and M/ΛQCD . Furthermore, if
the B-meson LCDA in QCD is calculable by lattice QCD
through large momentum effective theory, it would provide another way of accessing B-meson LCDA in HQET
comparing with Ref. [50].
The work reported in this paper can be generalized
along many directions: (a) It will be straightforward of
applying the method described in this paper to study
other heavy-light currents on the light-cone; (b) It will
be also interesting to study the heavy quark expansion
for nonlocal heavy-heavy operators; (c) In this paper the
nonlocal current is located on light-cone. A study on the
heavy quark expansion for equal-time operators would be
important for lattice simulations of heavy meson LCDAs,
through large momentum effective theory or Ioffe time

pseudo-distribution approach.
