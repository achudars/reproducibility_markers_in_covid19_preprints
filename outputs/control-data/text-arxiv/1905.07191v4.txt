Domains and domain walls are among the key factors that determine the performance of ferroelectric materials. In recent years, a unique type of domain walls, i.e., the sawtooth-shaped domain walls, has been observed
in BiFeO3 and PbTiO3 . Here, we build a minimal model to reveal the origin of these sawtooth-shaped domain walls. Incorporating this model into Monte-Carlo simulations shows that (i) the competition between the
long-range Coulomb interaction (due to bound charges) and short-range interaction (due to opposite dipoles) is
responsible for the formation of these peculiar domain walls and (ii) their relative strength is critical in determining the periodicity of these sawtooth-shaped domain walls. Necessary conditions to form such domain walls
are also discussed.

Domains, which are typical regions with aligned magnetic moments or electric dipoles, can largely influence phase
transitions and physical properties of magnetic or ferroelectric materials. For ferroelectrics, many attentions have been
paid to investigate domains’ characteristics and properties [1–
5]. When changing from the paraelectric to the ferroelectric
phase, the symmetry of equivalent dipole directions is broken, giving rise to regions with different polarization directions while each region has a preferred polarization direction.
Ferroelectric domain walls have received extensive attention
due to various novel phenomena, including stable patterns on
the nanometer scale. Domains have been carefully analyzed to
reveal the correlation between the micro/nanoscale structure
and the properties of the materials [6–9], often through high
resolution X-ray diffraction technique [10, 11]. For instance,
polarization switching is a critical link between domains and
material performance [12–17]. In bulk ferroelectrics, the domain structure, closely related to phase structure, was thoroughly discussed along with domain size and morphology. On
an even smaller scale, polar nanoregions as a special type of
domains have also been discussed [18–23].
Recently, charged domain walls have attracted much
investigation[24, 25]. They are a special type of interface between two domains that is ultrathin (usually on the nanoscale),
where bound carries arise from the abrupt change of polarization causing discontinuity on the interface. For instance,
the head-to-head polarization leads to a positive charge while
tail-to-tail configuration results in negative charge. Due to the
competition between the electrostatic energy (aligned dipoles
usually have smaller electrostatic energy) and the domain wall
energy (the extra energy necessary to have domains), domains can have very different morphologies, such as rhombohedral, orthorhombic, and tetragonal domains [26]. However, it was still quite surprising when sawtooth-shaped 180◦

domain walls were observed in multiferroic BiFeO3 (BFO)
(see Fig. 4(a) of Ref. [27]), which has a spontaneous polarization along the pseudocubic h111ic direction (that can be
as large as 90-95 µC/cm2 [28]) and a high Curie temperature (TC = 820 ◦ C) [29–31]. Note that the BiFeO3 sample of
Ref. [27] was cut along 1̄1̄0 and 11̄0 while extending 55
nm vertically when high resolutiontransmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were taken. More recently, Zou et
al. [32] also observed serrated 180◦ domain walls in PbTiO3
(PTO) thin films prepared by pulsed laser deposition. This
PTO thin film was 100 nm thick and epitaxially grown on a
(100)-oriented single crystal SrTiO3 substrate (see Figs. 2 and
4 of Ref. [32]). These observations indicate that sawtoothshaped domain wall constitute a general phenomenon in ferroelectrics, not limited to multiferroics or magnetic materials
[33, 34]. The bound charge on domain walls can be quite
large (for BFO, the bound charge is estimated to be 1.64 |e0 |,
where e0 is the electron charge [35]), which can strongly affect
the conductivity of the material by attracting free charge carriers, making them good candidates for domain wall electronics
[36–38]. Recent research also show that negative capacitance
is also closely related to dipole patterns and domain structures
[39, 40].
While charged domain walls have been known for a long
time [41] and different aspects had been investigated including
their conductivity [24, 25, 36, 42, 43]; their influence on other
dipoles and enhancement of material performance [44, 45];
their dynamics of the charged domain wall and interaction
with electric field [46–50], we are not aware of theoretical
work to explain the formation mechanism of the sawtoothshaped charged domain walls in ferroelectric materials. In this
work, we explore possible causes of this unique phenomenon
of sawtooth-shaped domain walls, finding that the long-range
Coulomb between bound charges and the short-range interac-

such peculiar domain walls.

morphology. During the simulation, the position of the bound
charges (rr i ) are tracked and changed to minimize the free energy. In each MC simulation at 300 K, we perform 320,000
sweeps of all the r i . We will first show the simulation results
and then discuss how the parameters (J and Z) can affect the
morphology.

domain wall. The symbol “ ” between dipoles represents bound
charges formed by head-to-head dipoles. (b) When a dipole is reversed, the domain wall and the position of one bound charge change
accordingly, and two pairs of opposite electric dipole pairs are generated at the left and right sides of the reversed dipole. (c) Another
configuration can also involve two pairs of opposite dipoles.

As a matter of fact, in order to understand the sawtooth domain walls, we propose a minimal model with just short-range
interaction between opposite dipoles and long-range Coulomb
interaction due to bound charges arising from the head-tohead dipoles, and following a similar approach as the effective Hamiltonian [51–56] to simulate 2D and 3D ferroelectric materials. We assume that (i) electric dipoles of opposite directions already exist in the system, and (ii) a boundary
exists between the two groups of opposite dipoles (see Fig.
1). As bound charges accumulate on the boundary, their positions can be used as dynamic variables in simulations while
the number of bound charges is fixed, which determines both
the Coulomb energy and the short-range interaction as Fig. 1
shows. Therefore, the total energy for the system is given by:
E tot = E cc ({rr i }) + E short ({rr i })

(1)

where r i is the position of the ith bound charge. E short is the
short-range energy when neighboring ions have relative shifts
[51]. For the 2D case shown in Fig. 1, the short-range interaction on the domain wall can be expressed as E short = JN,
where J > 0 is the additional energy associated with opposite neighboring dipoles and N (depending on {rr i }) is the
number of opposite dipole pairs. E cc = 21 ∑i, j Z 2 /εr r i − r j
is the long-range charge-charge Coulomb energy, where Z is
the bound charge, ε is the relative permittivity, and the energy
unit is Hartree. Since the sawtooth domain wall induces bound
charges and opposite dipole pairs, E tot can also be regarded as
the formation energy of the domain wall. For simplicity, we
use the energy of Fig. 1(a) as the reference energy E0 , implicitly subtracting E0 from E tot hereafter. It shall be emphasized
that the proposed energy terms constitute a minimal model
that, as we will show, demonstrate why sawtooth domain wall
arises. More sophisticated phenomenological model will be
discussed in the Supplemental Material.
Using the total energy of Eq. (1), Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations are employed to find the equilibrium domain wall

Figure 2. sawtooth-shaped domain wall in a 60 × 60 2D lattice.

For the 2D case, we use a 60 × 60 supercell to mimic a planar sample. The bound change is chosen as Z = 1.16 |e0 |,
which is an approximate estimation from the R3c phase
BiFeO3 [35], while the short-range interaction parameter is
taken to be J = 0.00586 Hartree (1 Hartree = 27.2 eV). The
relative permittivity is εr = 7.164 which renders a Coulomb
energy of Z 2 /εr a0 . We note J and εr can be inferred from the
parameters used in the effective Hamiltonian for BFO[31, 57–
59] and the value of J is compatible with the formation energy
calculation of domain walls [60–62]. We note that the exact
value of J or Z is not so important to give rise to the sawtooth domain wall.
 In addition, as we will see, the parameter
α = J/ Z 2 /εr a0 will largely determine the configuration.
Figure 2 displays a typical 2D simulation result, in which
the sawtooth domain walls can be clearly seen. The domain walls have an inclination of 71.47◦ (the inclination will
be determined by energy analysis) and can steadily exist for
200,000 MC sweeps. For the 3D case, we use the Ewald
method [63], which naturally models the periodic boundary
conditions of the supercell, to accelerate the evaluation of the
Coulomb energy. The short-range interaction is treated similarly as in 2D, except that four nearest neighbors need to be
considered instead of two. We note that, considering experimental situation (e.g., PTO on STO where ferroelectric regions are separated by non-ferroelectric ones), we do not assume bound charge exist on the top-bottom boundary. Moreover, for the 2D case, direct summation of Coulomb energy

Using a 40 × 10 × 40 supercell, we carry out 320,000
sweeps of MC simulation at 300 K, and the resulting domain
wall is shown in Fig. 3(a). Figure 3(b) shows the cross section at y = 8 where a triangular sawtooth domain wall can be
clearly seen. To compare to experimental HRTEM images, we
have also projected the dipoles along the y direction, averaging along each column, which results in Fig. 3(c). This figure
not only demonstrates the sawtooth domain walls, but can also
explain the smaller dipoles separating the two domains as observed in experiment [see Fig. 5(a) of Ref. [27]].
As we have seen, this model, which involves only Coulomb
and short-range interactions, is adequate to reproduce the sawtooth domain walls. With this model, it is also possible to
reveal and understand how Z and J can affect the domain
wall morphology. To simplify the analysis, we use the 2D
case as an example and only consider triangular sawtooth
domain walls with different inclinations (see Fig. 4). The
length of q
the domain wall can be formally defined as (in unit
of a0 ) ∑i (xi+1 − xi )2 + (yi+1 − yi )2 , where r i = a0 (xi , yi ) is
the position of the ith charge and a0 is the lattice constant. As
shownqin Fig. 4, xi+1 − xi = 1, therefore the length is given

by ∑i 1 + (yi+1 − yi )2 . Because the bound charge can only
shift in the up and down directions, it can be further simplified

which can unambiguously determine the triangular domain
wall. One advantage of this definition is that the shortrange energy is directly proportional to l (see Fig. 5a), i.e.
E short = Jl. The Coulomb energy also depends on l as E cc =
E cc (l) − E0cc where E0cc = Z 2 γ/a0 (in unit of Hartree) and γ is
a constant calculated according to the charge positions shown
in Fig. 4(a).
As l increases, the domain wall becomes sharper (i.e., the
inclination increases) [see Fig. 4(b)]. Given a domain wall
length, we can numerically calculate its constituent energies,
which are shown as symbols in Fig. 5. It can be seen that the
Coulomb energy and the short-range interaction energy show
opposite trends with the length of domain wall. The shortrange interaction increases with l, since larger l means more
opposite dipole pairs. The Coulomb energy decreases with l
due to the increase of bound charge distance.
To proceed further, we propose to use E cc =
Z 2 γ 1+bl 2
to describe how the Coulomb energy
a0 εr 1+al 2 − 1
changes with l, where γ = 220.8 for a 60 × 60 simulation
box. As a matter of fact, this expression can be used to fit
the numerically computed Coulomb energy in Fig. 5, giving
a = 1.99 × 10−4 and b = 7.18 × 10−5 . The total energy is
then given by

which can be derived by first considering the decrease of the
long-range energy with l (the blue line with solid circles in
Fig. 5(a)). The variation of the total energy with l is also
shown in Fig. 5(a). The equilibrium domain wall length l0
can be found by minimizing the total energy with respect to
l, and its dependence on J/(Z 2 /εr a0 ) is shown in Fig. 5(b).
This result indicates that the parameter α ≡ J/(Z 2 /εr a0 ) is
crucial for determining the domain morphology (which is independent of their absolute value) and larger α tends to bind
the bound charges closer to each other.
In the simulations that generate Figs. 2 and 3, α = 0.22 is
used. The resulting domain wall length and sawtooth period
are consistent with the theoretical estimation. In numerically
obtaining l0 for Fig. 5(b), we find that when α > 1.29, no
solution can be found for l0 , which is consistent with our numerical findings (not shown here) that arbitrarily chosen J and
Z cannot support the existence of such domain walls.
It shall be noted that the precondition for the above analysis is that triangular domain walls already exist. The constraint of α < 1.29 can be understood by estimating the two
energies of the configuration shown in Fig. 4(b). Assuming
that two neighboring bound charges are shifted by y vertically,
the short-range interaction is NJy (N = 60 for the 60 × 60
simulation box), while the Coulomb energy pertaining to this
configuration is the horizontal line of bound charges [Fig.

0 or α < ∑n=1 1/n − 1/ n + y2 /y ≤ 0.42 where the
maximum is reached when y = 1.7. This result further constrains the parameters that can form sawtooth domain walls,
indicating that there is an upper bound for α to make the sawtooth domain walls possible. This constraint, which is necessary to form sawtooth domain walls, is also verified using MC
simulation. For the 3D case, using the parameters chosen for
BFO, we found when α < 0.806, the sawtooth domain wall is
possible.
In addition to the constraint on α, it was pointed out that
180◦ domain occurs when no (or very small) epitaxial strain
are applied from the substrate, while 90◦ or other domain
patterns are expected with larger values [32, 65, 66]. This
can be understood with the strain-dipole coupling [51], where
the dipoles experience extra energy from strain, which likely

5
makes their flipping more difficult comparing to a partial rotation of 90◦ , effectively increasing the J parameter. In addition,
similar to magnetic domain walls [67], dislocation, impurity,
and defect can also hinder domain wall growth.
The effect of these parameters on the sawtooth domain
walls will be further discussed later. Since charged domain
walls can be compensated by free charge carriers [44, 68], the
tendency of the wall to be inclined is reduced as the Coulomb
interaction is reduced (α becomes larger). Depending on the
value of J, the sawtooth domain could still exist if J is small
enough. On the other hand, we need to note that charged domain walls are not always compensated by free carrier, such
as the hybrid perovskite materials [69].
In summary, we have built a minimal model to reveal
the origin of the sawtooth-shaped domain walls observed in
ferroelectric materials. Our model based MC simulations
show that the competition between the long-range Coulomb
energy from bound charges and the short-range interaction
energy are responsible for the formation of these peculiar
domain walls. Further analysis also shows that the combined
parameter J/ Z 2 /εr a0 is critical in determining the inclination of the sawtooth-shaped domain walls and its value has to
satisfy certain conditions for this unique type of domain walls
to appear in ferrolectrics.

In this supplemental material we show that adding another factor to the minimal model
will make our results compare even better to experiments. This further confirms that our
model indeed captures the most important factors that give rise to the sawtooth domain
walls.

Figure 1. Inclination flat domain wall can arise with the minimal model when the thickness is much
larger than the width of the simulation box.

We have shown that the the minimal model shows that inclined domain walls can develop
in ferroelectrics, which can turn into sawtooth domain walls when they encounter interfaces
or interacting with other domain walls. The reason is that the inclined flat domain wall
will eventually contact with the interface resulting in effective charges accumulating along
a straight line, which has higher energy than the swatooth domain wall. However, in the
extreme case that the thickness is much larger than its width (which is not very likely ), the
inclined flat domain wall can indeed be seen in the 2D simulations as seen in Fig. 1.
To address this issue, other factors need to be considered and added on top of those
adopted in the minimal model. The most likely factor, in our opinion, is that the Coulomb
interaction range is limited due to screening imposed by the dipoles in the background. In
2

fact, Zhou et al indicate that the locking of the inclined flat domain wall may contribute
to the formation of the zig-zag domain wall [1], which hints toward the fact that far-away
domain walls develop independently of each other and become zig-zag when they eventually
meet and interlock. This observation supports the idea to use a Coulomb interaction of
limited range.
As a matter of fact, while the minimal model has absorbed dipoles to the background,
they still exist in the real system and reorient slightly in accordance with the electric field
they experience. Such dipole dynamics, while small, could effectively screen the interaction
between bound charges, resulting in short-range Coulomb interaction (e.g., like the Yukawa
potential). Furthermore, bound charges can attract free charge carriers or charge defects,
which can compensate the bound charge, effectively reducing the interaction between the
bound charges [2]. To address such effects, we can add additional a factor to our model, i.e.,
using a finite Coulomb interaction range.

Figure 2. Simulation results for the 2D case when Coulomb interaction range is limited.

Figure 2 the sawtooth domain walls in 2D after limiting Coulomb interaction range. In
this simulation, we have used a 500 × 200 simulation box, and carry out 320,000 sweeps

of MC simulation at 300 K. Here we still use the parameters in the manuscript for the
simulation. The short-range interaction parameter is taken to be J = 0.00586 Hartree. The
effective bound change Z = 1.16 |e0 | and the relative permittivity εr = 7.164 are used in this

simulation, similar to those used in the main text. However, in this simulation, we have limit
the Coulomb between two bound charges to 15a0 With such a model, The simulation results
clearly show that the sawtooth domain wall can exist stably in the system, not affected by
the size of the simulation box. However, we have verified that the domain wall morphology,
and the period in particular, is affected by the interaction strength and the range of the
3

Coulomb interaction specified.

Figure 3. Simulation results for the 3D case when the Coulomb interaction range is limited. (a)
3D view of the simulation results; (b) A cross section in the y-z plane obtained at x = 23; (c) A
projection of 10 y-z layers along the x direction (x = 30 . . . 40).

For the 3D case, we empoly the Ewald method and periodic boundary conditions to
perform the simulation in a 40 × 40 × 40 box with the same parameters as in the 2D case.

In addition, we also set the limitation on the Coulomb interaction range to 10a0 (since the

simulation box size is smaller than the 2D case). After 30,000 Monte Carlo sweeps (i.e.,
30000 × 402 attempts to move the domain wall), the simulation results show domain walls

converges to a series of conical peaks as shown in Fig. 3(a). Figure 3(b) shows a cross section
of the domain wall in the y-z plane at x = 23 and Fig. 3(c) shows a cross section o shows
4

a projection of 10 y-z layers along the x direction (to compare to the results shown in the
main text) where the position of the domain wall is determined by averaging the positions
in those 10 layers. Both of Fig. 3(b) and (c) clearly show sawtooth domain walls.
An important feature for the 3D case is that, whether we cut the sample along x or y,
the sawtooth wall will always appear. As a matter of fact, Jia et al have indicated that
the striped domains are filled with sawtooth domain walls that can be seen along different
projection directions [3], supporting our simulation results. In addition, Fig. 4 shows a
similar projection as Fig. 3(c), but also records the averaged dipole values with negative
(positive) values indicate dipoles pointing upward (downward), which may be used to explain
the smaller dipoles seen on the domain wall as seen in experiments [3]. Finally, we have also

z

tried simulation boxes with different sizes, obtaining qualitatively similar results.
