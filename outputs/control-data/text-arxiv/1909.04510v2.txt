ABSTRACT
The collective behaviour of neural networks depends on the cellular and synaptic properties of the neurons. The phaseresponse curve (PRC) is an experimentally obtainable measure of cellular properties that quantifies the shift in the next spike
time of a neuron as a function of the phase at which stimulus is delivered to that neuron. The neuronal PRCs can be classified
as having either purely positive values (type I) or distinct positive and negative regions (type II). Networks of type 1 PRCs tend
not to synchronize via mutual excitatory synaptic connections. We study the synchronization properties of identical type I and
type II neurons, assuming unidirectional synapses. Performing the linear stability analysis and the numerical simulation of
the extended Kuramoto model, we show that feedforward loop motifs favour synchronization of type I excitatory and inhibitory
neurons, while feedback loop motifs destroy their synchronization tendency. Moreover, large directed networks, either without
feedback motifs or with many of them, have been constructed from the same undirected backbones, and a high synchronization
level is observed for directed acyclic graphs with type I neurons. It has been shown that, the synchronizability of type I neurons
depends on both the directionality of the network connectivity and the topology of its undirected backbone. The abundance of
feedforward motifs enhances the synchronizability of the directed acyclic graphs.

Introduction
For several decades, there has been a continuing research interest in the synchronization phenomenon due to its widespread
application in natural and artificial systems ranging from neural dynamics1–3 , cardiac pacemaker cells4 , and power grid
networks5 to social networks6 . Particularly, synchronization plays a key role in the proper functionality of brain neurons.
The synchronization of neuronal networks has been associated with many cognitive processes including memory formation7 ,
directed attention8, 9 , and the processing of sensory stimuli10 .
Synchronization patterns mainly depend on the dynamical properties of individual oscillators as well as the underlying
structural connectivity. It has been found that brain neurons have different types of intrinsic dynamics that close to threshold,
they may be grouped into two excitability classes: Type I and Type II. These two types of neurons are different in terms of
the bifurcation structure observed during their transition to firing. Type I oscillations arise via a saddle-node-onto-limit-cycle
bifurcation, whereas type II oscillations are initiated by Andronov-Hopf bifurcation. In addition, type I neurons exhibit a
continuous frequency-current curve, whereas type II neurons show a discontinuous frequency-current curve11, 12 .
The aforementioned excitability type of a single neuron can be quantified by the phase response curve (PRC) which is an
experimentally obtainable measure based on the transient change in the cycle period of the neuron in response to an external
stimulus13 . Different profiles of the neuronal phase response curve arise for different types of neurons in that in type I neurons,
any excitatory perturbation causes an acceleration of the next spike, while in type II neurons, perturbations cause acceleration
or delay of the next spike depending on the phase at which the perturbation is delivered to that neuron. These qualitatively
different responses to stimulation lead to dramatically different synchronization patterns in neural networks. Previous studies
have shown that, type I cells exhibit relatively poor propensity for synchronization under excitatory couplings, while type II
cells are synchronized better11, 14–16 . Experimental results verify the neurons’ ability to switch between types as well as the
coexistence of both cell types in the brain17–19 . For instance, changes in the neocortical synchronization during sleep-wake
cycle are often associated with excitability changes in the cortical neurons20, 21 .
Regarding the underlying network connectivity, Master Stability Function is a well-known formalism providing estimation
of the synchronization stability in the networks of coupled identical oscillators22 . According to this formalism, the spread of the
eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix is a synchronizability index. That is, the more compact the eigenvalues, the more likely the
synchronous state will be stable. This index works well when comparing synchronizability of chaotic oscillators and identical
Kuramoto oscillators. Using the index, it can be shown that complete graphs and directed acyclic graphs with identical node

in-degrees are optimal networks provided that they embed an oriented spanning tree23, 24 .
An entirely different approach to explore the impact of network structure on synchronization is investigating important
and dominant topological features of networks known as motifs25–28 . Motifs are significantly over represented subgraphs that
have been recognized as the building blocks of many real-world networks in various domains29 . Therefore, it’s important
to understand how the global dynamics are affected by the network motifs. For example, previous studies have shown that
feedback loop motifs contribute to two phenomena: responses to noise and dynamical stability30, 31 .
In this paper, we investigate the role of network motifs in synchronization of directed neural networks with type I or type II
neurons. Among various network motifs, we focus on two distinct categories: (I) feedback loops (FBL) and (II) feedforward
loop motifs (FFL). These motifs are commonly highlighted features observed in real-world networks and have attracted a great
deal of attention in the literature32, 33 . In order to study the dynamics of a large collection of such motifs, we generate two
different directed graphs, with the same undirected skeleton, constructed only from FFLs or FBLs. These directed graphs
are called directed acyclic graph (DAG) and balanced directed graph (BDG), respectively. Both analytical and simulation
results show that type I excitatory and inhibitory neurons are synchronized in directed acyclic networks (i.e. networks without
any feedback loops). However, these neurons fail to synchronize in undirected networks. In fact, feedback loops destroy
synchronization of the networks with identical type I neurons.

Material and Methods
Structure of the networks
An orientation of an undirected graph is an assignment of a single direction to each of its edges, turning the initial graph into a
directed graph. In this paper, using two different algorithms, we built different orientations of a graph such that the number of
feedback loops (FBLs) is maximized in one orientation and minimized in the other one. These algorithms are described bellow.
It has been shown that, the number of feedback loops increases by enhancing the correlation between the in- and out-degrees
of the nodes34 . Therefore, we start with an undirected graph, and try to assign each edge a single direction in such a way that
the in-degree and the out-degree of any given node are almost the same. The Eulerian cycle in an undirected graph is a cycle
that visits every link exactly once. An undirected graph has an Eulerian cycle if and only if every vertex has an even degree.
Eulerian orientation of a graph is an orientation that directs the edges along the Eulerian path such that every vertex has the
same number of incoming and outgoing edges. The resulting directed graph is called a balanced directed graph (BDG) and has
maximum number of feedback loops. In a network in which some nodes are of odd degree, we can still build an orientation
in a way that the resulting directed graph is almost balanced. To this end, a new fake node is added to the undirected graph
and any existing node with an odd degree is connected to this new node. Since every undirected graph has an even number of
nodes with odd degree, all the nodes in the new undirected graph have even degree and we can build the Eulerian orientation of
the new graph. After orienting the graph, the fake node is removed with all its adjacent links. In this manner, the difference
between in- and out-degree of each node is at most one and the oriented graph is almost balanced35 .
Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are constructed by extending the residual degree gradient method36, 36, 37 . At first, each
node is labeled by a residual degree which determines the number of adjacent undirected links. The residual values drop
as more adjacent links are assigned directions. Thus, initial and final residual values for each node equal to its degree and
zero, respectively. In each iteration of assigning the directions, the node with the smallest residual degree is selected and all
of its adjacent undirected links are assigned incoming directions. The residual values are updated afterwards and iterations
are repeated until there are no undirected edges left in the network. Since each node will have incoming links only from the
previously chosen nodes, the constructed graph will be acyclic. It is probable that this method gives rise to a disconnected
DAG which in turn leads to an incomplete synchronization. Therefore, to avoid drawing incorrect conclusions when comparing
synchronizability of different graphs, we have considered just connected DAGs in our simulations.
It should be noted that, directed and undirected networks should have the same number of nodes and arcs (i.e. unidirectional
links) to be comparable in terms of their synchronizability. To this end, we double the number of arcs while giving directions to
the links of an undirected graph. Therefore, the adjacency matrix of an undirected graph is defined as ai j = 1, if nodes i and
j are connected, and ai j = 0, otherwise. Whereas, the adjacency matrix of a directed graph is defined as, ai j = 2, if a link is
directed from node j to node i, and ai j = 0, otherwise.
Phase response curve (PRC)
The phase response curve (PRC) is an illustrative tool to determine the phase shift of an oscillating neuron in response to
a brief current pulse delivered at various phases of the cell cycle15 . It can be defined as, PRC = 1 − TTθ0 . Where T0 is the
unperturbed cycle period of the neuron, and Tθ is the cycle period when the neuron is perturbed at phase θ . Therefore, positive
and negative values of PRC indicate phase advances and delays, respectively. As mentioned before, neurons are classified into
two excitability classes: type I and type II. Type I neurons always respond to a small excitatory stimulus by advancing the next
spike. Therefore, they have positive values of PRC for all phases. In contrast, type II neuron, can advance or delay the next

spike depending on the phase at which the perturbation is delivered to them. Therefore, for type II neurons, the PRC versus θ
diagram, contains both positive and negative regions. Studies verify that the Hodgkin-Huxley neurons have PRC II excitability
type, while the Wang-Buzsáki and Traub neurons have PRC I excitability type38 .
Dynamics of the neurons
Neurons can be modeled using both phase oscillators and conductance-based models. Since phase models are simple enough
to be mathematically tractable, the networks of coupled phase oscillators have been widely studied to model biological and
physical systems including neuronal networks. On the other hand, the detailed investigation of the neuronal dynamics and
systematic parameter variation is possible through the use of conductance-based models. Here, we choose the extended
Kuramoto model (simulating dynamics of coupled phase oscillators) and Wang-Buzsáki and Traub neuron model (simulating
the dynamics of coupled spiking neurons) to consider different aspects in the synchronization of neuronal networks. In the
following, each model is explained with its corresponding synchronization order parameter.
Phase model

We use the extended Kuramoto model39, 40 to analyse the dynamics of directed networks with type I or type II oscillators. This
model assumes a network as a collection of N coupled phase oscillators such that the evolution of the ith oscillator is given by:
θ̇i = ωi +

(1 − cos(θ j − θi ))
K N
ai j G(θi , θ j ), G(θi , θ j ) = ui sin(θ j − θi ) + (1 − ui )
∑
N j=1

(1)

where θi is the phase of the ith oscillator and K is the overall coupling strength. The adjacency matrix of the graph is given by
A = (ai j ). Type I and type II oscillators are distinguished by ui = 0 and ui = 1, respectively. The function G(θ ) corresponds to
the phase response curve of the oscillator (see the figure S1). In our simulations, the initial values of θi are randomly drawn
from a uniform distribution in the interval [0, 2π], and natural frequencies are identical. The degree of synchrony of the phase
oscillators is quantified by the Kuramoto order parameters r, which is defined as r(t) = N1 h| ∑Ni=1 eiθi (t) |i. Here, h. . . i represents
averaging over different network realizations and initial conditions. The magnitude is 0 ≤ r ≤ 1. The extreme cases are r = 1
(coherent state) and r = 0 (incoherent state). The time average of r after achieving a steady state is symbolized by R.
Neuronal model

We used Wang-Buzsáki model to analyse the dynamics of the networks with type I inhibitory interneurons. The Wang-Buzsáki
neuron model includes the following differential equation41 :

where Cm is the capacitance of the neuron and v is the neuron’s membrane potential. h and n are time-varying activation
variables that depend on voltage-dependent rate functions ( αh , βh , αn , βn ). s, α and β are activation variable and rate functions
for synapses. φ is the control parameter which directly alters the time constants of sodium inactivation and potassium activation.

F is a scaling factor which is given by F(v) = 1/(1 + exp(−(v − θsyn )/2)). Here, θsyn is a parameter which must be set high
enough to have neurotransmitter release only when a spike has been emitted in the presynaptic neuron. INa , IK , IL , Isyn , and Iapp
represent sodium (Na+ ), delayed rectifier potassium (K + ), leakage, synaptic and external currents, respectively. The currents
are modeled by the following equations:
IL = gL (v − EL ), INa = gNa m3∞ h(v − ENa ), IK = gK n4 (v − EK ), Isyn,i =

where gL , gNa , gK , and gsyn are the maximal values of the conductances for leak, sodium, potassium and synaptic currents,
respectively, and EL , ENa , EK , and Esyn are their respective reversal potentials. K is the coupling strength and the summation
in Isyn,i occurs over all neighbours of the ith neuron. The steady state activation parameter of the sodium current is m∞ =
αm /(αm + βm ). The parameters of the Wang-Buzsáki model41 are summarized in the table S1. The rate functions are given by
the following functions:
αm = −0.1(v + 35)/(exp(−0.1(v + 35)) − 1), αh = 0.07 exp(−(v + 58)/20), αn = −0.01(v + 34)/(exp(−0.1(v + 34)) − 1),
βm = 4 exp(−(v + 60)/18), βh = 1/(exp(−0.1(v + 28)) + 1), βn = 0.125 exp(−(v + 44)/80).

We have also used the the Traub pyramidal excitatory type I neuron model42 . The equations describing the model is
= −INa − IK − IL − Isyn + Iapp , where gating variables m, n and h obey equations of the type ẋ = αx (v)(1 − x) − βx (v)x.
The rate functions are:

Cm dv
dt

αm = 0.32(v + 54)/(1 − exp(−(v + 25)/4)), αh = 0.128exp(−(v + 50)/18), αn = 0.032(v + 52)/(1 − exp(−(v + 52)/5))
βm = 0.28(v + 27)/(1 − exp((v + 27)/5) − 1), βh = 4/(1 + exp(−(v + 27)/5)), βn = 0.5 exp(−(v + 57)/40).

Synaptic gates satisfy ṡ = α(1 − s)/(1 + exp(−(v + 10)/10)) − β s, and synaptic current to the ith neuron is evaluated from
Isyn,i = K ∑ j∈Ni gsyn s(Vres ), where Ni are neighbors of the ith neuron and Vres is resetting membrane potential. The parameters
of the Traub neuron model, which corresponds to AMPA-receptor-mediated synapse, are summarized in the table S2.

There are various measures to quantify the level of synchrony in a large population of neurons within a network. Among
the various metrics, we choose the interspike distance synchrony measure, denoted as B. As one would expect, the minimum
interval between spikes of different neurons in synchronized state is less than that of asynchronous state. Based on this idea, the
spike synchrony measure is defined as follows43 :
p 2

hτx iτ − hτx i2τ

B=
−1 √
(2)
hτx i
N
where, N is the number of neurons in the network and τx = tx+1 − tx denotes the interspike interval of the merged set of network
spikes. Here, the inter-spike intervals are calculated between different neurons. h. . . iτ denotes the averaging over all intervals. It
can be shown that B is bounded between 0 and 1, where B = 1 and B = 0 represent fully synchronized and asynchronous states,
respectively. The voltage synchrony44 is another commonly used measure that has been investigated in the supplementary
material.

Results
First, we studied the synchronization stability of the FBLs and FFLs connecting identical type I or type II phase oscillators
analytically. For different motifs, we considered the reduced two-dimensional systems of the phase differences (the equations
are provided in the supplementary material). As expected, we found stable (unstable) synchronous states for type II excitatory
(inhibitory) FFLs and FBLs. On the other hand, we observed stable asynchronous state for type I excitatory and inhibitory
FBLs, and stable synchronous state for type I excitatory and inhibitory FFLs. In fact, both eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix,
for the synchronous state of the type I FFL, are zero. Consequently, this fixed point is globally stable, but not asymptotically. It
means that, if one perturbs the system and then leaves the system alone, the time dependence of the perturbation is milder than
exponential. The phase portraits of the type I and type II excitatory and inhibitory oscillators situated in different motifs are
plotted in the figure 1.
We also numerically investigated the synchronization stability of the type I and II identical excitatory phase oscillators
including different motifs (detailed explanation of the method is found in the supplementary material and the article written by
Wolf et al45 ). The evolutions of the three Lyapunov exponents for the type I and the type II FBLs and FFLs are demonstrated
in the first and the third rows of the figure 2. The steady Lyapunov exponents versus coupling strengths are plotted at the
second and the fourth rows of the figure 2. We can see that, as we expected from the analytical results, all the three Lyapunov
exponents for the type I FFLs are zero. The bottom panels of the figure 2 illustrate the evolution of the stationary order
parameter for the type I and II excitatory phase oscillators connected by FBLs and FFLs with various coupling strengths. As
anticipated, the results display the stable synchronous state for the type II FBLs and FFLs, and the type I FFLs. Therefore, the
feedforward loop motif is an optimal structure for synchronization of the identical excitatory type I phase oscillators. This is
also correct for the identical inhibitory type I phase oscillators (see figure 1).

strictly lower triangular form by a permutation matrix. Therefore, as we can see, our orientation algorithm constructs DAGs
correctly from different undirected graphs. The Laplacian matrix of directed network is defined as L = Din − A, where Din is
a diagonal matrix of in-degrees and A is the adjacency matrix. Real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian
matrices are shown in the bottom panels. The real parts and the imaginary parts of the complex eigenvalues have their own
information as the real parts reflect the undirected topology of the network and the imaginary parts reflect the effects of directed
links and loops35, 48 . For example, since the eigenvalues of a lower triangular matrix are the same as its diagonal entries, the
Laplacian eigenvalues of a DAG are real and equal to the in-degrees of its nodes. Therefore, as we expected DAGs do not have
any FBL and their eigenvalues are real. On the other hand, we can see that the variance of the imaginary part of the small-world
BDGs is higher than that of the scale-free BDGs. It is because of the fact that clustering coefficient of a small-world network
is higher than clustering coefficient of scale-free networks with the same number of nodes and arcs. Therefore, small-world
BDGs have higher number of FBLs than scale-free BDGs. In addition, because of the hubs (i.e. large-degree nodes in the
undirected graphs), the real parts of the eigenvalues of the scale-free BDGs are more spread out than small-world BDGs. On the
other hand, the real parts of the eigenvalues of the scale-free DAGs are compacter than small-world DAGs, because they have
narrower in-degree distributions. Note that based on our orientation algorithm the source node would be a hub in a scale-free
DAG. Now that we understood the structural differences between our directed networks, in the following we will compare the
synchronizability of type I and type II oscillators on these structures.
As mentioned, unlike FBLs, FFLs favour synchronization in networks of type I oscillators. However, in real world networks
motifs are merged together to form more complex structures. In order to see the effects of FFLs and FBLs in the synchronization
of the large networks, we constructed two different directed networks from the same undirected backbone. Balanced Directed
Graphs (BDGs) with many FBLs, and Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) without any FBL. The flow of information in the BDGs
is similar to their undirected backbone, but the information flow in the DAGs is directed from the source node to the rest of the
graph. Therefore, BDGs and DAGs are very different, even if they have the same undirected skeleton.
The synchronizability of the scale-free networks with different link-directionalities has been investigated in the figure 4. We
can see that type II oscillators are synchronized on all the three network structures. However, type I excitatory oscillators can be
synchronized only on DAGs. This proves that FBLs are harmful for synchronization of type I oscillators, while FFLs enhance
their synchronization. In addition, we found similar synchronization level for BDGs and undirected graphs. This result is in
agreement with previous finding that the synchronization condition for the symmetrized network guarantees synchronization in
the asymmetrical network with node balance49 . According to the plot of the Lyapunov exponents versus the coupling strengths,
all the Lyapunov exponets of the type I DAG are small. Therefore, we considered very long time simulation to estimate the
Lyapunov exponents of type I DAG. The results confirm that the absolute values of all the exponents are smaller than 10−5 (see
figure S2). Thus, the synchronous state for type I scale-free DAGs is globally stable but not asymptotically. This is similar to

the synchronous stability of their building blocks, i.e. the FFL motifs (see figure 1). The type I inhibitory phase oscillators are
also synchronized well on the DAG structures (see figure S3).
In order to better investigate the role of undirected topology of the DAGs on their synchronization, we construct the
DAGs from scale-free networks (p(d) ∝ d −γ ) with different scaling exponents (γ). As we know, increasing the scaling
exponents leads to more degree-homogeneous networks. Figure 5 shows the synchronization of the DAGs constructed from
the mentioned scale-free networks. The result shows that increasing the scaling exponents, decreases the clustering coefficient
and synchronizabilty of scale-free DAGs. The underlying reason is that, by reducing the scaling exponent in networks with
power-law degree distributions, the source node (the node with zero in-degree where the information flow starts from ) would
be able to reach every other node in the network easier. This characteristic has been previously shown for synchronization of
directed networks of type II oscillators30 .
The effect of gradually adding feedback loops to the DAGs is also investigated. The results show that the synchronizability
of the directed network decreases nonlinearly with increasing the number of the feedback loops (see figure S4).
In reality inhibitory and excitatory neurons work together to perform complex tasks. It has been suggested that excitatory
and inhibitory inputs of a neuron are balanced, and this balance is important for the highly irregular firing observed in the
cortex50 . Our results show that disconnected hybrid networks that are formed by feedforward motifs that their effective nodes
(i.e. nodes which have outgoing edges) are purely inhibitory or excitatory, can provide balance networks with incoherent
dynamics (see figure S5).
In the preceding parts, we investigated the synchronization of type I and type II phase oscillators, and we showed that
type I excitatory and inhibitory oscillators which are connected by DAGs are synchronized. However, previous studies have
shown that type I neurons are only synchronized with inhibitory synaptic connections41 . To address this concern, we study the
synchronizability of our oriented networks using conductance-based neuron models. First, we consider the type I Wang-Buzsáki
inhibitory neurons connected by scale-free directed networks. The characteristics of the Wang-Buzsáki model neurons have
been presented in the supplementary figure S6. This model has been used to show that gamma rhythm (20-80 Hz), which is
observed during behavioural arousal, can emerge in an undirected random network of interconnected inhibitory neurons41 .
However this rhythmic behaviour is only observed in the dense networks. Top panels of the figure 6 represent interspike
distance synchrony level of the type I Wang-Buzsáki neurons connected via scale-free undirected (U), BDG, and DAG by
inhibitory synapses in the Φ − Iapp parameter spaces. The results verify that type I Wang-Buzsáki neurons are not synchronized
on the sparse undirected graph and BDG. In contrast, there exists a parameter region in which neurons can be synchronized in
the scale-free DAGs. Moreover, it has been shown that synaptic time constants potentially play a role in the determination
of network frequency, and our results confirm this. In fact larger time constant makes the overall decay slower. Therefore,
increasing τsyn decreases the oscillation frequency for different values of the applied currents. In addition, we can see that
the synchrony index displays a peak at the small values of the τsyn . This would mean that synchrony is high only within a
restricted range of frequencies. These findings are consistent with the previous results obtained for dense undirected networks41 .
Here, the decay time constant of 10 ms that we used is consistent with GABAA receptor51 . The parameter φ also affects the
synchronization of the networks. In fact, decreasing φ reduces the firing rate by producing a deep afterhyperpolarization (see
figure S7). In our simulation, a spike is detected when the voltage of membrane reaches a fixed threshold (−55 mV) from a
lower value.
A similar behaviour is seen for the synchronization of the DAGs constructed by excitatory type I neurons by using Traub
neuron model (see figures 7 and S8 ). However, for excitatory neurons the oscillation frequency increases as the time constant

increases. The results on neuron models are also confirmed by using voltage synchrony measure (see the figures S9 and S10).

Discussion
The observed complex spatiotemporal neural activity patterns reflect both the connectivity and dynamic properties of individual
neurons. Two types of neuronal activities are found based on their different responses to the small depolarizing current pulses.
Type I neurons only speed up the oscillation when they receive the stimulus, whereas type II neurons experience both phase
advance and delay, depending on the timing of the perturbation. Previous studies have shown that, synchonizability of type
II neurons is higher than type I neurons in excitatory networks, while inhibition is more stabilizing the synchrony of type
I neurons52–56 . Adaptation can stabilize the synchrony of excitatory type I neurons by changing their PRC14 . But without
adaptation, excitation is desynchronizing even for fully connected identical type I neurons beyond the weak coupling regime57 .
However, the master stability formalism suggest that fully connected network is an optimal structure for the synchronization of
identical type II neurons. Therefore, the master stability approach can not be applied to investigate the synchronizability of
the networks of type I neurons. On the other hand, neurons are connected to each other through synapses which are mostly
unidirectional in passing signals. Based on the observations mentioned above, we studied synchronization properties of directed
networks of identical type I or type II neurons, assuming excitatory and inhibitory interactions.
Motifs are significantly over-represented subgraphs of a complex network, and play important roles in shaping its emergent
behaviours. Therefore, firstly we focused on the synchronization properties of two different motifs in directed networks:
feedback loops and feedforward loop motifs. Performing the linear stability analysis and the numerical simulation, we showed
that synchrony can emerge in the feedforward loops with identical type I oscillators and purely excitatory or inhibitory
connections. In fact, this synchronous state is globally stable but not asymptotically. Therefore, a small perturbation to the
synchronous state would cause the system to converge to the fixed point milder than exponentially. However, the asynchronous
state turns out to be asymptotically stable for feedback loops constructed from identical type I phase oscillators with purely
excitatory or inhibitory connections. The analytical results obtained are compared and found to comply with the results
obtained by using the extended Kuramoto model simulation. Next, we studied the synchronization of various types of neurons
coupled via large directed networks. To this end, we used different methods for assigning the link directions to construct two
different directed networks from the same undirected backbone, referred to as balanced degree graph (BDG ) and directed
acyclic graph (DAG). Precisely, many feedback loops are merged together to construct a BDG and only feedforward loop
motifs are combined to make a DAG. Both the linear stability analysis and the numerical simulation confirmed that identical
type I neurons connected by DAGs via strictly excitatory or inhibitory synapses are fully synchronized, while they are not
synchronized when they are connected by BDGs. We can see that the steady Lyapunov exponents of type I DAGs are zero.
This is in agreement with the result we found for the synchronization of feedforward loops. Therefore, studying the dynamics
of the motifs can provide an intermediate step to better understand the synchronization of the larger collections. Besides the

directionality, we showed that the undirected topology of the graphs also affects the synchronization of directed networks. The
DAGs constructed from undirected networks with higher clustering coefficients, have higher number of feedforward motifs and
higher synchronizability. In fact, a DAG is more synchronizable when all of its nodes are easily reachable from the source
node. The results are also verified using conductance-based Wang–Buzsáki and Traub neuron models. In reality inhibitory and
excitatory neurons work together to perform complex tasks. In general, excitatory and inhibitory inputs of a neuron are said to
be balanced, and this balance is important for the highly irregular firing observed in the cortex50 . The global dynamic of motifs
with hybrid effective nodes is very complex and directly related to the initial phase values. However, Our investigation suggests
that excitatory-inhibitory balance and incoherent dynamics can be provided by merging inhibitory and excitatory feedforward
motifs. Investigating the synchronization of neurons with different excitability types is important to understand the function of
the diffuse modulatory cholinergic systems in the brain20 . Our main result is that edge directionality significantly alter the
synchronizability of the type I neurons with purely excitatory connections, and it can not be ignored. Further studies are clearly
required to determine the interplay between neuronal excitability, frequency, edge directionality, and network synchronization.

Phase model
Analytical study of the stability of the synchronized motifs
In this section, we study the stability of the feedback and feedforward loops constructed
from the identical type I or type II phase oscillators.
We consider the reduced two-dimensional systems of the phase differences. Therefore, we define ωi = ω, θ1 − θ2 = φ1 , θ2 − θ3 = φ2 , θ1 − θ3 = φ1 + φ2 . Two phases
θ1 (t) and θ2 (t) are synchronized if their difference φ1 (t) is bounded at the stationary
state.
Using equation 1 (from the main text) and considering the type II phase oscillators
(ui = 1) situated in a FBL, the phase differences φ1 (t) and φ2 (t) clearly satisfy the
following equations:
φ˙1 = −σ [sin(φ1 + φ2 ) + sin(φ1 )] ,
φ˙2 = σ [sin(φ1 ) − sin(φ2 )] ,

(1)

2π
This system has different fixed points (φ∗1 , φ∗2 ) = (0, 0), (0, ±π), (±π, 0), (± 2π
3 , ± 3 ).
∗
∗
Where, the synchronous state (φ1 , φ2 ) = (0, 0) is stable (unstable) for excitatory (inhibitory having negative σ) phase oscillators.
In the case of the identical type II FFLs, the evolutions of the phase differences
are given by the following equations:

φ˙1 = −σ sin(φ1 ) ,
φ˙2 = σ [sin(φ1 ) − sin(φ2 ) − sin(φ1 + φ2 )] ,

(2)

The system has one stable (unstable) fixed point ((φ∗1 , φ∗2 ) = (0, 0)) for excitatory
(inhibitory) oscillators, and two lines of unstable fixed points (±π, φ∗2 ) for both exci1

tatory and inhibitory oscillators. Therefore, according to the above equations identical
excitatory type II motifs are synchronized, but not the inhibitory ones.
For the identical type I FBLs, the reduced two-dimensional system is as follows:
σ
φ˙1 = [cos(φ1 ) − cos(φ1 + φ2 )] ,
2
σ
˙
φ2 = [cos(φ2 ) − cos(φ1 )] ,
2

(3)

2π
This system has three fixed points: (φ∗1 , φ∗2 ) = (0, 0), (± 2π
3 , ± 3 ). In the cases of
2π
2π
∗
∗
((φ1 , φ2 ) = (± 3 , ± 3 )), the phases of oscillators are located at three equidistant
points around the unit circle (i.e. asynchronous state). In fact, asynchronous states are
stable for excitatory and inhibitory type I FBLs.
In the case of the identical type I FFLs, the evolutions of the phase differences are
given as follows:

σ
φ˙1 = − (1 − cos(φ1 )) ,
2
σ
˙
φ2 = [cos(φ2 ) − cos(φ1 ) + cos(φ1 + φ2 ) − 1] ,
2

(4)

This system has just one fixed point at (φ∗1 , φ∗2 ) = (0, 0). At this fixed point, both
eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix are zero. Therefore, this fixed point is globally stable, but not asymptotically stable. In fact, if one perturbs the system and then leaves
the system alone, the time dependence of the perturbation would be milder than exponential. Therefore, identical type I excitatory and inhibitory FFLs are synchronized.
The phase plane portraits have been depicted on the figure 1 of the manuscript.

Phase response curve of a phase oscillator
The phase response curve of a phase oscillator modeled by the generalized Kuramoto
model is given by G(θ) = u sin(θ) + (1 − u) (1−cos(θ))
. Where u = 0 and u = 1
2
correspond to the type I and type II oscillators, respectively (see figure S1).

Calculation of the Lyapunov exponents
Considering our continuous dynamical system in an n-dimensional phase space, we
monitor the long-term evolution of an infinitesimal n-ellipsoid of initial conditions.
The ith one-dimensional Lyapunov exponent is then defined in terms of the length of
the ellipsoidal principal axis pi (t) [1]:
λi = lim

t→∞

pi (t)
1
log2
,
t
pi (0)

(5)

where the Lyapunov exponents will be arranged such that: λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ ... ≥ λn . The
λ1 and λn correspond to the most rapidly expanding and contracting principal axes,
respectively. We simultaneously solve n equations of the system and n × n equations
of the linearized system. The growth of the corresponding set of vectors is measured,
2

and as the system evolves, the vectors are repeatedly reorthonormalized (e.g. every 50
time steps) using the Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization (GSO). This makes the vectors
maintain a proper phase space orientation.
The simulation programs were written in C++ and using Runge Kutta 4th order
integration scheme from Boost odeint library and time step of 0.01 time unit.
The steady-state is determined by convergence test. The simulation program memorizes subsequent values of each lyapunov exponent λi in N buffers of a fixed capacity
(e.g 2500 points). When the buffers are full, the program calculates standard deviation
of all the values in each of N buffers. If the standard deviation of values in any buffer
is too high (compared to a fixed threshold e.g. 10−6 ), then the buffers are cleared and
computations are continued. Otherwise, if the value of standard deviation for each
buffer is below a fixed threshold, the calculations are terminated. The final value of λi
returned by the program is equal to the average of all the values λi memorized in the
ith buffer [2].
The Lyapunov exponents versus time for identical type I and type II excitatory
phase oscillators connected by different scale-free networks are depicted in the Figure S2.

Synchronization of the inhibitory phase oscillators
Figure S3 compares the synchronizability of the excitatory and the inhibitory scalefree undirected and oriented graphs. We can see that only the DAGs constructed from
type I inhibitory oscillators are synchronized.

Gradually adding feedback loops to the DAGs
The effect of gradually adding feedback loops to the DAGs is investigated in the figure S4. The loops are added randomly to the DAGs and their number is calculated by
Trace(A3 )/3. We can see that the synchronizability of the scale-free directed networks
decreases nonlinearly with increasing the number of feedback loops. The high standard
deviations indicate the fact that in addition to the number of the feedback loops, their
positions are also important on the network synchronization.

Merged inhibitory and excitatory feedforward motifs
We show that type I inhibitory and excitatory connected DAGs (i.e. the networks that
have a single source node from which all other nodes are reachable) are synchronized.
However, in reality inhibitory and excitatory neurons work together to perform complex tasks. To address this issue, we consider the aggregation of two feedforward
motifs that their effective nodes (i.e. nodes which have outgoing edges) are purely inhibitory or excitatory (see Figure S5). The results show that, type I oscillators (but not
the type II ones) are synchronized when these motifs are merged together and form a
larger connected network. On the other hand, when the motifs joined to each other and
generate a disconnected network, the global synchronization of the oscillators breaks,
as one would expect. The results we derive are not changed qualitatively by swapping

3

excitatory and inhibitory nodes. In general, excitatory and inhibitory inputs of a neuron are said to be balanced, and this balance is important for the highly irregular firing
observed in the cortex. It seems that, disconnected networks constructed from motifs
with pure effective nodes can provide these kinds of patterns. Note that, the global
dynamics of motifs with hybrid effective nodes is more complex and directly related
to the initial phase values. Therefore, further investigations are required to understand
the relationship between structure and dynamics of large hybrid networks.

Neuron model
Characteristics of the neuron models
Tables S1 and S2 summarize the values we used in our simulations for the parameters of the Wang-Buzsáki and Traub models. The characteristics of Wang-Buzsáki
and Traub type I neurons are presented in the figure S6 and figure S8, respectively.
As we expected, the frequency-current curve for type I neurons is continuous and the
neuron fires at arbitrarily low frequencies. In addition, the phase response curve is an
exclusively positive curve.

Voltage synchrony measure
We also used the voltage synchrony measure to monitor the degree of spike synchrony
in the networks. This measure provides evaluations of long-term fluctuations in the
global potential as described by the following formula:
M=

1
N

p

hVg (t)2 it − hVg (t)i2t
,
PN p
hVi (t)2 it − hVi (t)i2t
i=1

Vg (t) =

Vi (t).
N i=1

where N is the number of neurons in the network, and Vg (t) is the average membrane
potentials of the neurons in the population (global potential). Here, h. . . it denotes
time-averaging over a large time interval. To normalize the measure, this value is
divided by the average fluctuations in the membrane potentials of single neurons. The
value of M is bounded between 0 and 1, where M = 1 and M = 0 indicate fully
synchronized and asynchronous states, respectively.
The synchronizations of type I Wang-Buzsáki inhibitory and Traub excitatory neurons connected by scale-free DAGs have been also investigated using voltage synchrony measure (see figure S9 and figure S10). The results are similar to that of found
using interspike distance synchrony measure (see figures 6 and 7 in the manuscript).
It means that there exist parameter regions in which type I inhibitory and excitatory
neurons are synchronized on scale-free DAGs.

The effects of parameter φ of the Wang-Buzsáki model
The parameter φ in the Wang-Buzsáki mode affects Neuronal afterhyperpolarizations.
Decreasing φ means reducing αh , βh , αn , and βn , that is to say slowing down h and

n. Therefore, decreasing φ reduces the firing rate by producing a deep afterhyperpolarization. The difference between the lowest value of the voltage and the firing threshold
is about 15 mV at φ = 5. This is in agreement with experimental results for fast-firing
inhibitory interneurons. However, for φ = 9 this difference disappears and the spikes
can not be distinguished (see figure S7).
