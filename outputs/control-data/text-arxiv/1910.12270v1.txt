A BSTRACT
We perform both analytical and numerical bifurcation analysis of a forest-grassland ecosystem
model coupled with human interaction. The model consists of two nonlinear ordinary differential equations incorporating the human perception of forest/grassland value. The system displays
multiple steady states corresponding to different forest densities as well as regimes characterized
by both stable and unstable limit cycles. We derive analytically the conditions with respect to the
model parameters that give rise to various types of codimension-one criticalities such as transcritical,
saddle-node, and Andronov-Hopf bifurcations and codimension-two criticalities such as cusp and
Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations. We also perform a numerical continuation of the branches of limit
cycles. By doing so, we reveal turning points of limit cycles marking the appearance/disappearance
of sustained oscillations. These far-from-equilibrium criticalities that cannot be detected analytically give rise to the abrupt loss of the sustained oscillations, thus leading to another mechanism of
catastrophic shifts.

Introduction
Many ecosystems are characterized by a rich nonlinear behaviour including multistability as well the appearance of
sustained oscillations and catastrophic shifts [25, 22, 19, 16, 3]. For example, catastrophic/regime shifts have been
observed in shallow lakes[26], the North Pacific, in the North Sea and Caribbean coral reefs [6], in regions of northern
Africa going abruptly from vegetated to desert conditions.
Frequently, the disturbances in ecosystems that drive such regime shifts are caused by human interactions [20, 11, 2,
12]. Thus, the understanding from a mathematical point of view of how disturbances/and or state changes influence
the dynamics of ecosystems is very important in order to prevent and control ecological disasters [25, 21]. From a
nonlinear dynamics perspective, a sudden shift from one regime to another can be observed if the system has different
coexisting stable regimes [25, 15, 21, 14, 23]. In such cases, as a consequence of a vector state perturbation, the

A

PREPRINT

system may jump to a different stable state due to the crossing of its basin of attraction boundary [21]. Another way, in
which sudden transitions may be observed is by parameter perturbations beyond a bifurcation point [21]. Thus, many
studies in the field pinpoint the significance of bifurcation theory to explain, analyse and ultimately forecast beforehand
sudden regime shifts [18, 25, 24, 1, 17, 20, 14, 9, 4, 8, 28]. However, despite the well-established tools of bifurcation
theory, many studies still use simple temporal simulations and/or simple linear numerical analysis to study models
that are used to approximate real-world ecosystems. Recently, we have stressed the importance of using the arsenal
of analytical and numerical methods of bifurcation theory and particularly that of codimension-2 bifurcation analysis
to systematically identify and characterize criticalities in ecological models and in general in physicalm biological
and natural systems [23]. However, only few studies have used both analytical and numerical bifurcation analysis
(i.e. not just temporal numerical simulations for the verification of the analytical findings, which do not suffice to
identify and trace in the parameter space branches of far-from-equilibrium bifurcation points such as limit points of
limit cycles), thus to study in a combined and complete way not only bifurcations at equilibrium but also bifurcations
far-from-equilibrium (see for example [10, 18, 28, 13, 5, 29]).
Here, we provide both analytical and numerical bifurcation results for a forest-grassland model with human interaction proposed by Innes et al. [15]. Forest-grassland mosaic ecosystems are typical examples of ecosystems where
two species (forest and grass) compete for the same food (soil, sunlight and space) and their dynamics are strongly
affected by human interactions [15, 1]. Despite the simplicity of the model, as we show, its nonlinear dynamical
behavior is very rich including various types of codimension-one and codimension-two criticalities. We derive analytically the conditions for the onset of these criticalities including the codimension-one transcritical, saddle-node and
Andronov-Hopf bifurcations as well as the codimension-two cusp and Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations. We also perform a two-parameter numerical bifurcation analysis to identify far-from-equilibrium criticalities such as limit points
of limit cycles that cannot in principle be found analytically. By doing so, we provide a full picture of the mechanisms pertaining to the onset of codimension-one and codimension-two criticalities in a combined way. In the next
section, we briefly present the mathematical model. We then provide the analytical results and consequently perform
a numerical continuation of the limit cycles and construct the two-parameter bifurcation diagram to fully characterize
the different dynamical regimes.

1 Model Description
The model describes the dynamics of a simple mosaic ecosystem of two species, grassland and forest under the human
impact. Let f and g be the proportion of forest and grassland in the ecosystem, with f + g = 1. Humans influence
the fate of the evolution by selecting one of the species based on their abundance or lack. Let x be the percentage
of the human population that prefer forest; thus, 1 − x is the ratio of people that prefer grassland. Each individual
can alter his/her preference to forest or grassland according to some social-depended rules (educational or mimetic),
or according to the perceived value of the forest. The coupled model of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) reads
[15]:
 df
dt = w (f ) (1 − f ) f − νf − J (x)
(1)
dx
dt = sx (1 − x) U (f )
where ν express the transition rate from forest to grassland due to natural processes and w(f ) is the rate of transition
from grassland to forest mainly induced due to fire modelled by the following relation:
c
(2)
w (f ) =
f
+b
−k 1−f
1+e
The w function is of sigmoid type while the properties of its shape depend from the parameters b, c and k; c gives the
maximum value, while b, k are related to the rate of activation of w.
The human influence is represented in the above system of ODEs by the term J(x) = h(1 − 2x), where h is the
potential magnitude of human influence on the ecosystem. The human interaction has a positive or negative feedback
on the perceived value of the forest: if the majority prefers forest (i.e. x > 1/2) the society will enhance forest
recreation (i.e −J(x) > 0) by reforestation; instead if social opinion favours grassland then the human impact leads
to deforestation (i.e −J(x) < 0). The perceived value of the forest U (f ) is given by: U (f ) = (1 − f ) − f = 1 − 2f .
For more details on the model see Innes et al. 2013[15].

2 Analytical Results
We first give a geometrical description for the multiplicity of fixed point solutions. Then, we derive analytically
the fixed point solutions and characterize their stability. Consequently, we proceed with the construction of the one2

parameter bifurcation diagrams with respect to the human influence h as well as the k parameter. Then, we provide
the conditions for the existence of the saddle-node and Andronov-Hopf bifurcations.
2.1 Fixed Point Solutions-Stability Analysis
Setting the derivative of the second equation of Eq.(1) equal to zero, we get three solutions: x = 0, the x = 1 and
f = 1/2.
Starting with x = 0 and substituting to the first equation of Eq.(1) and setting this to zero, we obtain
w (f ) (1 − f ) f − νf − h = 0

(3)

The above equation defines a nonlinear function of fixed points for the forest density f (0 ≤ f ≤ 1) with respect to h
when x = 0:
h = h (f ) = w (f ) (1 − f ) f − νf
(4)
In Fig.1 we have plot h(f ) for a specific choice of the values of the other parameters of the model.
For x = 1, we get a symmetric expression for the parameter h for the second branch of fixed points (f (h), x = 1) i.e.
h = h (f ) = −w (f ) (1 − f ) f + νf

(5)

This is the mirror case of the fixed points corresponding to x = 0 with respect to the y-axis (see blue line in Fig.1).
Finally, for f = 1/2 and by setting zero the first equation of the system (1), we get:
c
w (1/2) (1/4) − ν/2 = h (1 − 2x) ⇔
− 2ν = 4h(1 − 2x)
1 + eb−k
The above gives rise to another family of solutions of fixed points (f = 1/2, x) with x given by:

2.1.1 A Geometrical Description of the Multiplicity of Fixed Points
Fig.2 shows the fixed point solutions for x = 0, x = 1 as they result from Eq.(4) and Eq.(5) as intersection points of
the graphs of the functions νf and w (f ) (1 − f ) f − J(x) for various choices of the values of the other parameters.

parameter values, there are no fixed points solutions for positive values of h. (b) x = 1. Depending on h, the number

fixed points for the x = 0 branch of solutions. Fig.2(b) depicts the intersection of the graphs for the x = 1 branch of
solutions. As h increases, the number of steady state regimes first increases from one to three and then decreases to
zero. Finally, it should be considered that the branch of steady state solutions f = 1/2 exists for all values of h.
For k = 6.5, ν = 0.2 the intersections of the graphs are depicted in Fig.2(c),(d) as h is varied. In particular, in Fig.2(c)
we show fixed points corresponding to x = 0 and in Fig.2(d) the ones corresponding to x = 1. As it is shown, for
x = 0, as h is larger than 0, the number of solutions goes from three to two, indicating that h = 0 is a bifurcation point.
When h > 0.07, there are no solutions corresponding to x = 0. For the case of x = 1, when h > 0, there are three
solutions, two of them disappearing at h = 0.1. Again for very high values of h, there are no solutions corresponding
to x = 1.
While this graphical analysis can give a quick idea of the number of solutions for different values of h, it cannot give
a precise information about the stability and type of bifurcations that may appear. Moreover, dynamic regimes like
periodic solutions cannot be detected. Thus, in what follows, we perform a systematic analytical study of the stability
of fixed point solutions and their bifurcations.
2.1.2 Stability Analysis of Fixed Points
The stability of the above families of fixed points is determined from the eigenvalues λ1 , λ2 of the Jacobian matrix
of 1 evaluated at the fixed points.
The Jacobian matrix of 1 reads:

2h
J=
(8)
−2sx(1 − x)
s(1 − 2x) · (1 − 2f )
Clearly, when x = 0 or x = 1, the Jacobian matrix has an upper triangular form since J2,1 is vanished. In these
cases, the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix are real and equal to the diagonal elements. This implies that any loss of
hyperbolicity (for x = 0 or x = 1) cannot be due to Andronov-Hopf bifurcations.

The determinant of the Jacobian matrix for x = 0 is given by:

or

Note that:


det(J)|x=0 = w′ (f ) · (f − f 2 ) + w (f ) · (1 − 2f ) − v · s (1 − 2f )

(10)

det(J)|x=1 = −det(J)|x=0

(11)

Eq.(11) provides the stability relation between the x = 0 and x = 1 branches: the stability of one branch implies the
instability of the other. Thus, it suffices to study the stability properties of just one of them, for example the x = 0
solution branch. From Eq.(2), the derivative of w with respect to f is given by:

(12)

Note that both w(f ) and w′ (f ) are always positive (i.e. w is a positive increasing function of f ). The trace of J at
x = 0 is given by:

T r(J)|x=0 = w′ (f ) · (f − f 2 ) + w (f ) · (1 − 2f ) − v + s (1 − 2f )

(13)

Thus, for x = 0, we examine separately two cases that mark the onset of a critical point: (a) J2,2 = 0 (resulting from
f = 1/2 (see Eq.(9))) and (b) J1,1 = 0.
As we prove in the next section, the case (a) corresponds to the appearance of a transcritical bifurcation, while the case
(b) corresponds to the appearance of a saddle-node bifurcation.
2.2 Transcritical Bifurcations
We examine the case when the two branches of fixed points intersect at (f ∗ , x∗ ) = (1/2, 0). Note by Eq.(7) and Eq.(6),
that the value of the parameter h that results to x = 0 in Eq.(7) is given by: h∗ = w(1/2)/4 − ν/2 or equivalently by:
h∗ =

c
− ν/2
4(1 + eb−k )

(14)

That is, for the above parameter value h∗ , the above families of branches of fixed points (i.e. the ones defined by (a)
x = 0 and h(f ) (given by Eq.(4)) and (b) f = 1/2 and x (given by Eq.(7)) intersect at (f = 1/2, x = 0).
Depending on the values of the other parameters, i.e. c, b, k, the value of h∗ may change sign.
The upper triangular form of the Jacobian matrix evaluated at (f ∗ , x∗ ) = (1/2, 0) implies that J22 = λ2 = 0, while
c·keb−k
the second eigenvalue is given by (see Eq.(9)): λ1 = w′ (1/2) · (1/4) − ν = (1+e
b−k )2 − ν.
Clearly if λ1 is of constant sign around f = 1/2:
c · keb−k

(15)

then the second eigenvalue J22 = λ2 = s(1 − 2f ) changes sign with respect to f , when f ∈ ( 12 − ǫ, 21 + ǫ): (when
λ2 = s(1 − 2f ) > 0 ⇔ f < 1/2 and when λ2 = s(1 − 2f ) < 0 ⇔ f > 1/2).
If λ1 < 0,i.e. when
λ1 = w′ (1/2) · (1/4) − ν < 0 ⇔

(16)

A

PREPRINT

then we have a change of stability of solutions from unstable (λ2 > 0(f < 1/2), λ1 < 0) to stable
(λ2 < 0(f > 1/2), λ1 < 0).
If λ1 > 0, i.e. when
λ1 = w′ (1/2) · (1/4) − ν > 0 ⇔

c · keb−k

−ν >0

(17)

the transition is from unstable nodes (f < 1/2) (two positives eigenvalues) to saddle nodes (two eigenvalues with
opposite sign).
We summarise the above results in the following Theorem.
Theorem 1 The point (f ∗ , x∗ ) = (1/2, 0) is a critical point for the branch of fixed point solutions defined by x = 0.
The value of the parameter h∗ that defines this criticality is given by h∗ = 4(1+ec b−k ) − ν/2. In the case where (16)
holds true, there is a change of stability from unstable states when f < 1/2 to stable states when f > 1/2. If Eq.(17)
holds, then the x = 0 branch remains locally unstable.
To determine the type of bifurcation at (f ∗ , x∗ ) = (1/2, 0), we proceed as follows.
The Jacobian matrix at (f ∗ , x∗ ) = (1/2, 0) reads:
J=



w′ (1/2) 1/4 − ν
0


2h
0

(18)

meaning that rank(J)f =1/2,x=0 = 1 and the derivative of the system Eq.(1) with respect to the parameter h is
Jh (1/2, 0) = e1 = [1, 0]T , meaning that
Jh (1/2, 0) ∈ Range(J(1/2, 0)) = span{[1, 0]T }.

(19)

Then, (f ∗ , x∗ ) = (1/2, 0) is a simple bifurcation point [27] and since there are exactly two intersecting branches, we
conclude that this type of bifurcation is a transcritical bifurcation.
The stability of the f = 1/2 branch can again be determined with the aid of Eq.(7) and Eq.(14). Thus, the solution x
for the branch f = 1/2 can be re-written as:
h∗
(20)
x = 1/2(1 − )
h
For h < h∗ < 0 =⇒ 1 > h∗ /h =⇒ x > 0, (while if 0 > h > h∗ , we have the opposite (non-physical) scenario i.e.
x < 0). The determinant along the f = 1/2 branch of solutions is:
det(J)|f =1/2 = 4s · h · x(1 − x)
Note that 1 − x > 0 and assuming that s is constant, if h < h∗ < 0
h∗ < h < 0 =⇒ det(J)|f =1/2 > 0.

(21)
=⇒

det(J)|f =1/2 < 0, and, if

Here, we comment that the stability properties of this branch are not independent from the stability of the x = 0
branch. The trace of the Jacobian at f = 1/2 is:
T r(J)|f =1/2 = w′ (1/2) · 1/4 − ν

(22)

Then, assuming that T r(J)|f =1/2 < 0 (and in combination with the sign of the determinant) this is translated as a
change from unstable (h < h∗ < 0) to stable (h∗ < h < 0) fixed point solutions. But the assumption T r(J)|f =1/2 <
0 is identical with Eq.(16), which defines the change of stability on the x = 0 branch around the critical point
(f ∗ , x∗ ) = (1/2, 0), from unstable (f < 1/2) to stable (f > 1/2) solutions (see Eq.(16-17)).
To conclude, at the fixed point (x∗ , f ∗ ) = (0, 1/2) we have an exchange of stability, which is characteristic of
transcritical bifurcation. We state the following theorem:
Theorem 2 The system undergoes a transcritical bifurcation at (f ∗ , x∗ ) = (1/2, 0). In the cases where Eq.(16) and
h∗ < 0 hold true, then, as h and f increase, the two branches x = 0 and f = 1/2 exchange their stability from
unstable to stable state and vice versa.

2.3 Saddle-Node and Cusp Bifurcations
2.3.1 Bifurcations on the x = 0 branch of fixed point solutions
Here, we examine the second case (J11 = 0) for the existence of non-hyperbolic points on the branch x = 0, (see
Eq.(9)).
For this case, we obtain:
J11 (f ) = w′ (f ) · (f − f 2 ) + w(f ) · (1 − 2f ) − ν = 0

The system of Eq.(4),Eq.(24) defines the appearance of critical points (the Jacobian becomes singular). The two
nonlinear equations can be solved numerically (e.g. by the Newton-Raphson method) with respect to the unknowns
h, f . We will show analytically, that depending on the value of the parameters h, k and ν > 0, the above nonlinear
system can have at most two solutions. Furthermore, we show that the corresponding criticalities are saddle-node
bifurcations.

f = 1. In the neighborhood of f = 0, it converges to a constant function the −ν, while, in the neighborhood of f = 1,
it converges asymptotically to (1 − 2f ) − ν. Between the two boundaries, J1,1 has a bell shape resulting from the

stability properties of the x = 0 branch near the turning points results in a straightforward manner from the signs of
eigenvalues. We assume that the roots of J11 have the following order 1/2 < ρ1 < ρ2 . This ordering can be achieved

points. In addition, if the conditions b > k and Eq.(16) are imposed i.e. (1/2 < ρ1 < ρ2 ), then stability properties are
determined according to Table 1.

2.3.2 Bifurcations on the x = 1 branch of fixed point solutions
In this section, we conduct our analysis for the second symmetric branch of fixed point solutions, x = 1. Following
the previous analysis, we study the transcritical bifurcation at the point (1/2, 1) and the stability properties of turning
points.
The determinant of Jacobian matrix along the x = 1 is given by:
det(J)|x=1 =

w′ (f ) · (f − f 2 ) + w (f ) · (1 − 2f ) − ν
0

2h
−s · (1 − 2f )

(33)

and similar to the x = 0 case, the triangular form of the Jacobian matrix gives immediately the eigenvalues on the
branch: λ′1 = J11 = λ1 and λ′2 = J22 = −s(1 − 2f ) = −λ2 . For the simplicity of the presentation, we suppose that
hold true the same assumptions for λ1 (i.e. Eq.(16)) and for the ordering of the roots of J11 as in the previous case.
The determinant becomes singular at (f, x) = (1/2, 1), while if f > 1/2 =⇒ λ′2 > 0 and if f < 1/2 =⇒ λ′2 < 0.
Near the point (1/2, 1) and as the parameter h increases, the x = 1 branch changes stability from stable to unstable.
The critical value of the parameter h on the bifurcation point resulting from Eq.(5) by setting f = 1/2 is given by:
h∗∗ = −h∗ = −w(1/2)/4 + ν/2 or
h∗∗ = −

c
+ ν/2
4(1 + eb−k )

(34)

The Jacobian matrix evaluated at the point (1/2, 1) is exactly the same as the one evaluated at x = 0 (Eq.(18)) and the
condition Eq.(19) continues to be valid, concluding that at (1/2, 1) a transcritical bifurcation appears.
The stability of the f = 1/2 branch near the critical point (1/2, 1) can be determined as follows. By substituting h∗∗
(given by Eq.(34)) into Eq.(7) we get:
x = 1/2(1 +

h∗∗
)
h

(35)

Assuming that h∗∗ > 0, then for h > h∗∗ > 0 =⇒ 1 > h∗∗ /h =⇒ 1 − x = 1/2(1 − h∗∗/h) > 0. The determinant
reads:
det(J)|f =1/2 = 4s · h · x(1 − x)
(36)
concluding that det(J)|f =1/2 > 0 for h > h∗∗ > 0 and det(J)|f =1/2 < 0 for h∗∗ > h > 0. Since the condition given
by Eq.(16) holds true, the sign of the trace of the Jacobian reads:
T r(J)|f =1/2 = w′ (1/2) · 1/4 − ν < 0.

(37)

The above implies that as h increases, the stability of the branch f = 1/2 changes from unstable (f < 1/2) to stable
(f > 1/2).
We summarize the above results with the following theorem.
Theorem 5 The system ( 2) undergoes a transcritical bifurcation at (f ∗ , x∗ ) = (1/2, 1). In the cases where Eq.(16)
and h∗∗ > 0 hold true, then, the two branches x = 1 and f = 1/2 exchange stability at that bifurcation point. The
value of the parameter h on the bifurcation point is given by h∗∗ = − 4(1+ec b−k ) + ν/2.
The stability properties of the x = 1 branch can easily be calculated from Eq.(11) and from the analysis of the J11
function. Table 2 summarizes the stability along the branch x = 1 with respect to the sign of the eigenvalues. We
observe that for f > 1/2, the branch of solutions remains unstable. At the turning points ρ1,2 , the transition is from
saddle to unstable nodes (in ρ1 ) and again back to saddles.
Theorem 6 Assuming that Eq.(15) and Eq.(28) hold, then the x = 1 branch of solutions posses two turning points.
In addition if the conditions b > k and Eq.(16) are imposed i.e.(1/2 < ρ1 < ρ2 ), then the stability properties of the
branch are determined according to Table 2.
As an example of the above analysis, we present the bifurcation diagram of f with respect to h for k = 6.5, ν = 0.9,
s = 10 (Fig.4). Solid lines depict stable solutions, while dashed lines unstable ones. Note that for this choice of the
values of s, k, ν, there are no fixed point solutions for x = 0 (h > 0); hence this bifurcation branch corresponds

Starting from small values of h, the system has two solutions, one stable corresponding to x = 1 and another unstable
for f = 1/2. As h increases, the ”S" branch crosses the horizontal line and the two branches exchange their stability
through a transcritical bifurcation (T R) at (f, x, h) = (0.5, 1, 0.447). The ”S" branch also displays two saddle-node
bifurcation points (SN 1) at (f, x, h) = (0.58, 1, 0.494) and (SN 2) at (f, x, h) = (0.67, 1, 0.404). Between (SN 1)
and (SN 2), the system displays four steady states and just one of these is stable.

Returning back to Fig.1, we are now in the position to characterize the types of bifurcations and stability of the solution
branches. Fixing the values of the parameters at s = 10, k = 6.5, b = 11, ν = 0.2, the annotated bifurcation diagram
of f with respect to the parameter h is shown in Fig.5.
Solid lines depict stable fixed points, while dashed lines depict unstable ones. As discussed above, there are three
branches of steady states: one inverted “S branch corresponding to x = 0, an “S" branch corresponding to the locus of
steady states with x = 1, and the horizontal line corresponding to the fixed points with f = 0.5. In order to understand,
from a nonlinear dynamical point of view, the behaviour of the x = 0 branch of fixed points, we show the bifurcation
diagram also for negative values of h. In particular, in Fig.5 the stability of each fixed point is reported: (−, −) are
stable nodes with two negative eigenvalues; (−, +) are saddles with one negative and one positive eigenvalue, and
(+, +) are unstable nodes with two positive eigenvalues. It is apparent, that the branch of the fixed points x = 0

appears with a mirror “S"-shape with respect to the x = 1 “‘S" branch (as we proved in the previous section). Both the
“S"-shaped branches (x = 0 and x = 1) cross the horizontal line f = 1/2 giving rise to two transcritical bifurcations
(T R1 for the x = 1 branch, T R2 for the x = 0 branch) on which the branches of fixed points exchange their stability.
Thus, looking just at the positive values of h, up to the value corresponding to the saddle node bifurcation SN 4, there
are six steady states: two stable nodes (one for x = 0 and one for x = 1), three saddles (one for x = 0,one for x = 1
and one for f = 1/2) and one unstable node (for x = 0). Multistability and multiplicity of fixed points is observed
in a wide range of parameters, whereas as the parameter h passes the value of one corresponding to the saddle-node
point SN 1, only one stable steady state exists.

When the human influence is strong enough, the system reaches an balanced equilibrium with 50% of grass and 50%
of forest. On the other hand when the human influence is weak, then multiple stable steady states may occur and
thus catastrophic transitions are possible between steady states with a very different percent of grass and forest as we
discuss in the next section.
2.4 Catastrophic shifts
In an ecosystem, catastrophic shifts occur when the system passes from a stable regime to another completely different
regime in an abrupt way as a consequence of environmental or external disturbances. When this happens, the recovery
of the previous state is extremely difficult due (in the majority of the cases) to hysteresis effects. From a dynamical
point of view, a catastrophic shift may occur in two ways: (a) as a consequence of perturbations of the vector state in
a parameter region where the system has multistability, and/or (b) as a consequence of a perturbation of the value of a
11

parameter near criticality.
In the first case, if the system has more than one stable regime for a specific value of the bifurcation parameter (here,
the parameter h), then as a consequence of a perturbation in the vector state (here x or f ), the system may jump from
one equilibrium to another. As each stable regime is characterized by its own basin of attraction (the set of all the
initial conditions leading to the same stable regime), a perturbation to the vector state may bring it to another basin of
attraction which drives the system to a different stable state.

t = 100. Perturbation of the (a) forest state f variable, (b) the grass g variable. (c) The corresponding phase diagram.
The dashed line is the separatrix between the attraction basins of the two stable states.
This phenomenon is illustrated in Fig.6, where temporal simulation results are reported for an h parameter value
belonging to the region of multistability [0; SN 4]. In this region, there are two stable steady states: one corresponding
to x = 0 and one to x = 1. Starting from an initial condition within the basin of attraction of x = 1, the system
reaches first the steady state x = 1 and then, when a perturbation is imposed (around t=100), the system finally
reaches the steady state x = 0 (see Fig.6(a),(b)). Indeed, as a consequence of the state vector perturbations, the
system trajectory crosses the separatrix of the attraction basins of the two stable states (see Fig.6(c)).
The second way with which a catastrophic transition may occur is when one equilibrium disappears as a consequence
of a perturbation of the value of the bifurcation parameter near the critical point. In this case, the system reaches a new
stable equilibrium in an abrupt way. Such transitions are observed for example when a parameter crosses a critical
value corresponding to a catastrophic bifurcation such as a saddle-node bifurcation point. This case is illustrated in
Fig.7, where it is clearly shown that if the system is at the stable steady state x = 0 just before the critical value
of SN 4, then a small perturbation of the parameter leads the system to another equilibrium (x = 1) with a sharp
transition.

2.5 Andronov-Hopf and Bogdanov-Takens Bifurcations
First, we examine the existence of periodic solutions due to the appearance of Andronov-Hopf bifurcations. Since
the two branches x = 0, x = 1 have always real eigenvalues, we seek for Andronov-Hopf points on the third branch
which is the f = 1/2. The Jacobian matrix along the f = 1/2 branch of solutions reads:
J(f = 1/2) =

P (λ) = |A − λI|

= λ2 − (w′ (1/2) 1/4 − ν)λ + 4sxh(1 − x)

(38)

(39)

If the discriminant of the characteristic polynomial is negative, i.e. ∆ < 0 and the roots are passing the y−axis with
non zero slope, then the assumptions for the Andronov-Hopf bifurcation are satisfied. In that case, the eigenvalues are
summing up to zero or equivalently:
λ1 + λ2 = T r(J) = 0 ⇔ w′ (1/2) 1/4 − ν = 0

which is the opposite of Eq.(15). The characteristic polynomial given by Eq.(39) takes the form:

with roots λ1,2 = ±2i sxh(1 − x) while x must satisfy Eq.(7) and that xh(1 − x) > 0 (taking that s > 0). Eq.(41)
is independent from h and together with Eq.(7) define a system of equations which has always a solution for each h
with only restriction the positiveness of the product of xh(1 − x). Taking into account Eq.(7) we then obtain:

In the case where h > 0, the last inequality holds if h > −h∗ = h∗∗ . In order to better understand the above behaviour,
we performed a two-parameter bifurcation analysis with respect to the parameters h, k.
2.5.1 Two-parameter Bifurcation Analysis for the Andronov-Hopf Points
In the (h, k) parameter plane, the locus of the Andronov-Hopf points defined by Eq.(41) are horizontal lines since
Eq.(41) is independent from h. With constant ν, Eq.(41) is written as (h satisfies Eq.(43)):

the Eq.(44) has two uneven roots with respect to k which can be expressed in an implicit form as:

resulting to k1 = 7.439 and k2 = 15.31 (these values correspond to the horizontal lines in Fig.8(a)). In the same figure,
we also depict the two-parameter continuation of turning points, resulting from the system of equations Eq.(4),(24)
and Eq.(5),(24). In Fig.8(b), we depict the continuation of turning points for higher values of k and also for h < 0. In
Fig.8(b), two symmetric branches with respect to the vertical line h = 0 exist, approaching asymptotically k-infinity

as h → 0 (see Fig.8(b)).
An explanation of this asymptotic behavior is provided by using elements of singular two-scale analysis for the function
(24). The domain of forest mass variable f is f ∈ [0, 1]. Assuming that k >> 0, then in the scale of order of 1/k i.e.

O(1/k), a bell shape front appears. Since J11 (0) ≈ −ν and J11 (b/(b + k)) = cb
4 + 2(k+b) − ν → 4 + 2 − ν > 0
then one root of J11 (the turning point) belongs to the interval [0, b/(b + k)] i.e. 0 ≤ ρ1 ≤ b/b + k. As k increases,
this implies b/b + k → 0 =⇒ ρ1 → 0. From Eq. (4) or Eq.(5), we obtain h → 0, which is the asymptotic behavior
in the neighborhood of h = 0.
The second asymptotic behavior results in the slow scale (f > 1/k). Then, the large value of k vanishes the first part
of J11 concluding J11 → (1 − 2f ) − ν. Setting J11 = 0 in order to take the second root ρ2 , we obtain ρ2 ≈ 1−ν

corresponding value of h is given from Eq.(4) and Eq.(5) resulting to the asymptotic values of h i.e.

where the ± correspond to x = 0, x = 1 branches, respectively.
Of particular interest is the case when Eq.(41) holds true along the x = 0 or x = 1 branches, respectively (opposite
signs in (15)). Based on our analysis, this case occurs when one of the saddle-node points (on x = 1, x = 0 branches)
collapse with the transcritical points at the f = 1/2 branch (which happens when the first root of J11 , ρ1 = 1/2). In
that case, the Jacobian matrix has the form:

Similarly for x = 1, the system is the same, except that x = 1 and h = h∗∗ , with (fc2 , xc2 , hc2 , kc2 ) =

Setting f → f − 1/2, the Taylor expansion of the vector field of Eq.(1) around the point (1/2, 0) reads:

where a2 (k) = c(((16k 2 e2(b−k) )/(e(b−k) + 1)2 + (e(b−k) 8(k − k 2 ))/4(e(b−k) + 1))2 − 1/(eb−k) + 1)),
a1 (k) = ((ckeb−k )/(eb−k + 1)2 − ν) and finally a0 (k) = h − ν/2 + c/4(eb−k + 1).
In the 2D-parametric space (h, k), the following scenarios appear: For h > h∗∗ and nearby the parameter values, a
horizontal line starts giving the locus of Andronov-Hopf bifurcations i.e. Eq.(44). This also implies a1 = a0 = 0, i.e.
two equilibria collapse via a saddle-node bifurcation. The above cases are characteristic of Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations (whose existence is confirmed also through the two-parameter numerical bifurcation analysis that is presented in
the next section).

3 Numerical Bifurcation Analysis
As we have shown analytically, the simple model of forest-grassland dynamics with human interaction proposed
by Innes et al.[15] exhibits a reach nonlinear behaviour with saddle-node bifurcations, transcritical bifurcations,
Andronov-Hopf bifurcations that give rise to sustained oscillations as well as codimension-two bifurcations including cusp points and Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations.
With an appropriate choice of the parameter values (for example for h = 0.5 there are transient oscillations and
periodic regimes as the parameter k increases. In particular, Fig.9 reports several simulations for different increasing
values of k (with the same initial conditions). Starting from very small values of k, the system quickly reaches a stable
state (see Fig.9(a)). Long transient oscillations appear as k is further increased (see Fig.9(b)). The time length of the
transient oscillations also increases with the k parameter and for larger values of k, the system manifests a permanent
oscillating behavior (see Fig.9(c)).

while the red line to x (a) k = 4, (b) k = 4.57 and (c) k = 4.7.
Although the above analytical results provide a complete picture of various types of bifurcations of fixed points, it is
not possible to find other types of “far-from-equilibrium" bifurcations such as limit (turning) points of limit cycles that
can mark the onset of another type of catastrophic shift. For that purpose, one has to resort to the tools of numerical
bifurcation analysis and in particular to the numerical continuation of limit cycles. This involves the solution of a
boundary value problem. Let us consider for example the following system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations
(that can also result from the discretization of a system of Partial Differential Equations, by e.g. finite differences or
finite elements methods):

where x ∈ Rn denotes the state vector, p ∈ R is the bifurcation parameter and F ∈ C r .

Then, one seeks solutions that satisfy the periodicity condition:
x(t) = x(t + T )

(51)

where T denotes the (unknown) period to be computed together with x. This is accomplished by solving the following
rescaled with t′ = Tt boundary value problem:
ẋ = T F (x, p), x(0) = x(1)
s.t.h(x, p) = 0

(52)

where h(x, p) = 0 is the so-called pinning condition which factors out the infinite periodic solutions due to transnational invariance in time. A general pinning condition that is implemented also in MATCONT (a numerical continuation toolbox) is realized by the integral:

h(x, p) =

where ẋold (t) is the tangent vector of a previously calculated limit cycle. For the solution of the above boundary value
problem, MATCONT uses orthogonal collocation, while for the continuation paste limit points, the Moore-Penrose
technique is used [7].
The results on the numerical bifurcation analysis of limit cycles are presented in the next section.
3.1 Numerical-Continuation of Limit Cycles
We first computed numerically the one-parameter bifurcation diagram of the limit cycles by fixing different values of
h using k as the bifurcation parameter. We used Matcont [7] to construct the bifurcation diagram of limit cycles with
respect to the parameter k, for various values of h, ν = 0.2. The continuation of limit cycles with MATCONT was
performed using 20 mesh points and 4 collocation points, with absolute and relative convergence tolerances set equal
to 1E −04 , thus guarantying the reliability of the numerical solution of the boundary value problem. The one-parameter
bifurcation diagram is shown in Fig.10. Solid lines depict stable steady solutions, while dashed lines the unstable ones.
Limit cycles are indicated with circles: filled for stable and empty for unstable.
Solid lines refer to stable steady solutions, whereas dashed lines refer to unstable ones. Limit cycles are indicated with
circles: filled for stable and empty for unstable.

Starting from very small values of k, the fixed point branch of solutions loses its stability through a subcritical
Andronov-Hopf bifurcation point (H1) as predicted analytically. From H1, a branch of unstable limit cycles arises
which gains stability through a turning (limit) point cycle bifurcation (LP C1). As noted, this point is a far-fromequilibrium bifurcation and cannot be computed without the aid of numerical bifurcation analysis. The limit cycles
are stable in the range [LP C1; LP C2], whereas a branch of unstable limit cycles connects the bifurcation LP C2 with
a second subcritical Andronov-Hopf bifurcation (H2). It is clear that, for this value of the parameter, there are two
ranges of bistability, [LP C1; H1] and [H2; LP C2]. It is worth noting, as also shown analytically, that an increase
of the value of h from 0.7 to 15, the critical values of the k parameter, where the two Andronov-Hopf bifurcations H1
and H2 occur do not change, thus leaving unchanged the range where the limit cycles are the only stable regimes. On
the other hand, the critical values of k where the limit point bifurcation of limit cycles LCP 2 change, thus making the
bistability windows [H2; LP C2] wider and wider, whereas the bistability range [LP C1; H1] remains the same.
3.2 Catastrophic Shifts on Periodic Regimes
Similar analysis for the catastrophic shifts we obtain on the periodic regime. The one-parameter bifurcation diagram of
limit cycles elucidates the mechanism. Fig.11 shows different responses of the system under different disturbances. In
particular, Fig.11(a), (b) show two temporal simulations after a weak perturbation (Fig.11(a)) and a strong perturbation
(Fig.11(b)) of the state vector. In the first case, the system reaches again the final steady state, whereas with a strong
perturbation, the system approaches a dynamic periodic regime. Finally, in Fig.11(c), the system exhibits a catastrophic
shift from the periodic regime to the steady state as consequence of a parameter perturbation.

3.3 Two-Parameter Numerical Bifurcation Analysis
To get a complete picture of the system’s dynamics and the mechanisms that govern them, we performed a twoparameter numerical bifurcation analysis in the (k, h) parameter plane. The resulting bifurcation diagram is shown in
Fig. 12. There, we show the loci of the saddle-node bifurcations SN 1 and SN 4 (shown in Fig.5), the Andronov-Hopf
bifurcations H1 and H2 and the limit point bifurcations of the limit cycles (LP C1) and (LP C2).
It is clear that, for large values of the human impact, as reflected by the parameter h, the bifurcation values LCP 1
and LCP 2 remain constant. The loci of the various bifurcations delimit the parameter regions in different dynamics.
In the case of strong human impact i.e. for higher values of h, the dynamics are characterized from the following
scenarios (regions denoted as A, B, C in Fig.12): In region A we have stable limit cycles and unstable steady states.
In region B we have stable and unstable limit cycles and stable steady states. In region C we have stable steady states.
We observe that as the value of h increases, the corresponding critical point LP C2 remains almost unchanged with
respect to k, k ≈ 30, concluding that the human interactions do not have any impact on the fire effect. Instead, in the
regime of low values of h, (reflecting weak human impact), the dynamics can be categorized in the following regions
(see Fig.5). In the region D we have stable steady states (x = 0 branch, monostability). In the region F, we have
stable steady states (x = 1 branch alternates with f = 1/2 at BT point of H2) while, the region E is characterized by
multistability of steady states (see Fig.5). In the region G, we have stable steady states (x = 1 branch, monostability).

Figure 12: Two-parameter bifurcation analysis with respect to the parameters h, k; the values of the other parameters
are set as b = 11, c = 1, s = 10, ν = 0. As presented in the previous sections the continuation of the turning points
(SN 1, SN 4) and the Andronov-Hopf points was made analytically (section 2). Continuation of the limit points of the
limit cycles was achieved using numerical bifurcation techniques. BT denote the Bogdanov-Takens points.

4 Discussion
We performed an analytical and numerical one- and two-parameter bifurcation analysis of a forest grassland model
which considers dynamically human interactions and their preference based on the rarity perception value. We show
that despite the simplicity of the model, the nonlinear dynamic behavior is very rich including multistablity of states
due to saddle-node and transcritical bifurcations, the appearance and disappearance of sustained oscillations due to
Andronov-Hopf bifurcations and due to the existence of limit points of limit cycles. In this context, we derived
analytically the conditions that mark the onset of such transitions and derived the loci of the bifurcations in the twoparameter space (reflecting the impact of the human influence and the effect of the fire on the rate of the reproduction
of the forest). The conditions that meet codimension-two bifurcations such as Bogdanov-Takens which mark the
coincide of saddle-node bifurcation (turning) points with Andronov-Hopf and saddle homoclinic bifurcations and
cusp points, which mark the appearance/dissapearence of saddle-node bifurcations, are also given. Moreover, we
performed a numerical bifurcation analysis to trace far-from-equilibrium criticalities, such as limit points of limit
cycles, whose analytical computation is prohibitive. By doing so, we constructed the full two-parameter bifurcation
diagram providing a full characterization of the dynamical regimes.
