MANIFOLDS OF POSITIVE RICCI CURVATURE
ALEJANDRA RAMÍREZ-LUNA

Abstract. Let M n+1 be an orientable compact Riemannian manifold with
positive Ricci curvature. We prove that the Almgren-Pitts width of M n+1
is achieved by an orientable index 1 minimal hypersurface with multiplicity 1
and optimal regularity. This extends to dimensions n + 1 ≥ 8 the results of
Ketover-Marques-Neves [2] and X. Zhou [6].

1. Introduction
Let M n+1 be an orientable compact Riemannian manifold. A problem of great
interest is the search of minimal hypersurfaces in M n+1 . The min-max theory is a
method established by F. Almgren and J. Pitts to produce minimal hypersurfaces.
They showed the existence of a smooth, closed, embedded minimal hypersurface in
a Riemannian manifold when 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 ([1], [4]) . Schoen and Simon [5] generalized it to the case of dimension n ≥ 6 (when n ≥ 7 this hypersurface might have a
singular set of Hausdorff codimension greater than or equal to 7). Let Zn (M n+1 )
be the space of integral cycles and Φ : [0, 1] → Zn (M n+1 ) (which will be denoted
by {Φs }1s=0 ) be a sweepout. Denote by Π all the mappings Λ which are homotopic
to Φ in Zn (M n+1 ). We define the width of M n+1 as
L(Π) := inf { max Hn (Λ(x))}.
Λ∈Π x∈[0,1]

Theorem 1.1. [4][5] Under the above conditions L(Π) > 0, and there exists a
stationary integral varifold V , whose support is a disjoint collection of connected,
closed, singular, minimal hypersurfaces {Σi }li=1 , with singular sets of Hausdorff
dimension no larger than n − 7 (which may have multiplicity mi ∈ N), such that
Pl
V = i=1 mi [Σi ], and
l
X
mi Hn (Σi ) = L(Π).
i=1

The characterization of these hypersurfaces has been studied over the last years.
Xin Zhou characterized the min-max hypersurface when Ricg > 0, first for 2 ≤ n ≤
6 and then for n ≥ 7, after work of Marques-Neves [3] when n = 2.
Theorem 1.2. [6] Let (M n+1 , g) be any (n + 1) dimensional connected, closed,
orientable Riemannian manifold with positive Ricci curvature. Then the min-max
hypersurface Σ is either:

Remark 1.3. In the proof of the last theorem we can see that L(Π) = Hn (Σ), if Σ
is orientable or L(Π) = 2Hn (Σ), if Σ is non-orientable.
Later on, Ketover, Marques and Neves [2] ruled out the second possibility in the
last theorem when 3 ≤ n + 1 ≤ 7
Theorem 1.4. [2] For 3 ≤ n+1 ≤ 7, the Almgren-Pitts width of an orientable Riemannian manifold M n+1 with positive Ricci curvature is achieved by an orientable
index 1 minimal hypersurface with multiplicity 1.
In this paper we complete the characterization by showing that orientability also
holds in high dimensions. Our main result is:
Theorem 1.5. The Almgren-Pitts width of an orientable Riemannian manifold
M n+1 with positive Ricci curvature is achieved by an orientable index 1 minimal
hypersurface with multiplicity 1 and optimal regularity.
Remark 1.6. If M is non-orientable the Theorem 1.5 is true with orientable index 1 changed by 2−sided index 1 and considering the Almgren-Pitts width with
coefficients in Z2 .
The proof of Theorem 1.5 will be carried out by contradiction. By Theorem
1.2 and Remark 1.3 suppose the min-max hypersurface Σ is non-orientable and
L(Π) = 2Hn (Σ). It will suffice to show the existence of a sweepout {Λs }1s=0 in
M n+1 such that
sup Hn (Λs ) < 2Hn (Σ).

We will start with the family given by Xin Zhou (see Theorem 2.2). We will modify
it as in [2] to obtain the desired sweepout.
In fact, the family will begin in the same way that Xin Zhou began the distance
family {Σt } until an appropriate time δ0 . At the fixed moment δ0 , a cylinder
of constant height δ0 will be opened up to an appropriate radius R. Then, with
constant radius R the family given by Zhou will be continued but at every moment h
the cylinder of radius R and height h will appear and the interior of the intersection
between the cylinder mentioned above and Σh will be removed.

2. Preliminary concepts and theorems
In this section we give some concepts and theorems needed along the paper.
Let (M n+1 , g) be a connected, closed, orientable Riemannian manifold and Σ a
closed, embedded, orientable hypersurface in M n+1 with singular set of Hausdorff
co-dimension no less than 7. We consider M n+1 embedded in RN for some N .
Notation 1. The following notations and definitions are given by Xin Zhou in
section 2 in [6].
• C(M ) is the space of sets Ω ⊂ M with finite perimeter.
• [[Ω]] is the corresponding integral current with the natural orientation when
Ω ∈ C(M ) or Ω is a closed, orientable hypersurface in M with a singular
set of Hausdorff dimension no larger that n − 7.
• M and F are the mass norm and flat norm of the space of k−dimensional
integral currents in RN with support in M n+1 , respectively.
Notation 2. Let us denote,
• Bt (p) := {x ∈ M ; d(p, x) < t}.
• Ct,h (p) := {expq (sη(q)); q ∈ ∂Bt (p) ∩ Σ; s ∈ [−h, h]}
• Bt,h (p) := {expq (hη(q)) : q ∈ Bt (p) ∩ Σ} ∪ {expq (−hη(q)) : q ∈ Bt (p) ∩ Σ}

where η is a unit normal vector field defined in a neighborhood of p in the regular
part of Σ.
Definition 2.1. If Σ has singularities let us denote by Sing(Σ) the set of singularities of Σ and S the set of connected, closed, minimal, hypersurfaces Σ of M n+1
with Sing(Σ) of codimension no less than 7. We say Σ ∈ S has optimal regularity.
The following result was proven in [6] (see Proposition 3.6 of [6]). Let Σ ∈ S be
a non-orientable hypersurface in M . Consider the distance family {Σt } given by
Σt := {x ∈ M n+1 : dist(x, Σ) = t}.

where dist(x, Σ) is the non-signed distance function.

Proposition 2.2. [6] Assume that Ricg > 0. For any Σ ∈ S non-orientable, the
distance family {Σt }t∈[0,d(M)] satisfies:
• Σ0 = Σ
• Hn (Σt ) < 2Hn (Σ), for all 0 < t ≤ d(M )
• When t → 0, Hn (Σt ) → 2Hn (Σ), and Σt converge smoothly to a double
cover of Σ in any open set U ⊂ M \ Sing(Σ) with compact closure Ū .

where d(M ) is the diameter of M n+1 .

Remark 2.3. Notice that dist(x, Σ̄) is achieved by a regular point of Σ. Also, in
the proof of the last proposition we have the estimate
√
(2.1)
Hn (Σt ) ≤ 2 cosn ( κt)Hn (Σ),
where κ is a constant such that Ricg ≥ nκ.
d(M)

Remark 2.4. Using a change of variables, we can consider {Σt }t=0 in the interval
[0, 1] ({Σs }1s=0 ).

3. MAIN RESULT
The reader can find in Section 4 of [6] the precise definitions of width and sweepouts in Almgren-Pitts min-max theory.
Theorem 3.1. The Almgren-Pitts width of an orientable closed Riemannian manifold M n+1 with positive Ricci curvature is achieved by an orientable index 1 minimal
hypersurface with multiplicity 1 and optimal regularity.
Proof. Because of Theorem 1.4 we can assume n ≥ 7. We are going to proceed by
contradiction. Let Σn be the min-max hypersurface. By Theorem 1.2 and Remark
1.3 we can suppose Σ is a closed embedded non-orientable minimal hypersurface
such that L(Π) = 2Hn (Σ). (Notice that Σ might have a singular set of codimension
at least 7). The idea is to create a sweepout {Λs }1s=0 in M n+1 such that
sup Hn (Λs ) < 2Hn (Σ),

(3.1)

s∈[0,1]

which by definition of L(Π) would be a contradiction.
By Proposition 2.2 and Remarks 2.3 and 2.4, we have a sweepout {Σr }1r=0 of
n+1
M
and δ > 0 such that Σ0 = Σ,
(3.2)

sup Hn (Σr ) < 2Hn (Σ) and Hn (Σh ) ≤ 2Hn (Σ) − Ah2 ; ∀h ∈ [0, δ],

r∈[δ,1]

for some constant A > 0. We are going to modify {Σr }1r=0 from r = δ0 to r = 0
for some δ0 ≤ δ that will be specified later. At the instant r = δ0 we will start to
open up a cylinder of height δ0 in a point p ∈ Σ (away from the singularities of Σ)
of radius t = 0 to t = R, for an R that will be given below. We have the following
Euclidean comparisons. There exists an R > 0 so that for any p ∈ Σ and t ≤ R
there holds
(3.3)

ctn ≤ Hn (Σ ∩ Bt (p)) ≤ Ctn

(3.4)

ctn−1 ≤ Hn−1 (Σ ∩ ∂Bt (p)) ≤ Ctn−1 .

Also there exists h0 > 0 so that whenever h ≤ h0 one has the next area bounds
(3.5)
and
(3.6)

chtn−1 ≤ Hn (Ct,h (p)) ≤ Chtn−1

ctn ≤ Hn (Bt,h (p)) ≤ Ctn .

Let p ∈ Σ such that BR (p) ∩ Σ does not contain singular points. Let us define
(3.7)

Λh,t := {Σh ∪ Ct,h (p)} \ Bt,h (p).

If follows from equations (3.2), (3.5) and (3.6) that
(3.8)

Hn (Λh,t ) ≤ 2Hn (Σ) − Ah2 + Chtn−1 − ctn .

The maximum value of the function f (t) := Chtn−1 − ctn is at the point

Therefore from inequality (3.8) there is a B > 0 (independent of t) such that for
all t ≤ R

(3.9)

(3.10)

t=

Hn (Λh,t ) ≤ 2Hn (Σ) − Ah2 + Bhn .

Making h0 smaller we have that for all h ≤ h0 and t ≤ R

Notice that in the previous step it was important to have n > 2. When n = 2 it is
necessary to consider the catenoid estimate [2]. Moreover, when t = R we obtain
from inequality (3.8)
(3.11)

(3.12)

Hn (Λh,t ) ≤ 2Hn (Σ) −

Hn (Λh,R ) ≤ 2Hn (Σ) − Ah2 + ChRn−1 − cRn .

Making h0 smaller again so that h0 ≤

cR
2C

we obtain for h ≤ h0

c
Hn (Λh,R ) ≤ 2Hn (Σ) − Ah2 − Rn .
2
The last inequality tell us that opening the hole up to time t = R we decrease area
by a definite amount depending on R and not on h.
Let δ0 = min{δ, h0 }. Since Λδ0 ,0 = Σδ0 , we can continue our sweepout by
1
concatenating {Λδ0 ,t }R
t=0 with {Σr }r=δ0 . From inequality (3.11) we have control of
Hn (Λδ0 ,t ). In fact, for all t ≤ R
(3.13)

(3.14)

Hn (Λδ0 ,t ) ≤ 2Hn (Σ) −

We continue our sweepout by concatenating {Λh,R }0h=δ0 to {Λδ0 ,t }R
t=0 . From inequality (3.13) we also have control of Hn (Λh,R ). In fact, for all h ≤ δ0
(3.15)

c
Hn (Λh,R ) ≤ 2Hn (Σ) − Rn .

Let us define the sweepout {Λs }1s=0 described above:

if
0 ≤ s ≤ 1/3

Λδ0 ,−3Rs+2R
if 1/3 ≤ s ≤ 2/3
Λs =

Σ3(1−δ0 )s+3δ0 −2 if
2/3 ≤ s ≤ 1

By inequalities (3.2), (3.14) and (3.15), the sweepout {Λs }1s=0 is such that
(3.16)

sup Hn (Λs ) < 2Hn (Σ).

Contradiction, which finishes the proof of Theorem 3.1.
