We explore the potential of current and next generation of coherent elastic neutrinonucleus scattering (CEνNS) experiments in probing neutrino electromagnetic interactions. On the basis of a thorough statistical analysis, we determine the sensitivities
on each component of the Majorana neutrino transition magnetic moment (TMM),
|Λi |, that follow from low-energy neutrino-nucleus experiments. We derive the sensitivity to neutrino TMM from the first CEνNS measurement by the COHERENT
experiment, at the Spallation Neutron Source. We also present results for the next
phases of COHERENT using HPGe, LAr and NaI[Tl] detectors and for reactor neutrino experiments such as CONUS, CONNIE, MINER, TEXONO and RED100. The
role of the CP violating phases in each case is also briefly discussed. We conclude
that future CEνNS experiments with low-threshold capabilities can improve current
TMM limits obtained from Borexino data.

INTRODUCTION

One of the major recent milestones in particle physics has been the discovery of neutrino
oscillations [1–5]. It implies that neutrinos are massive and, hence, new physics must exist in
order to provide neutrino masses and mixings [6, 7]. Massive neutrinos are expected to have
non-trivial electromagnetic properties such as magnetic moments and charge radius [8–15].
Here we focus on the former. Although the expected magnitude of magnetic moments is
typically small, it is rather model-dependent and constitutes a precious probe of physics
beyond the Standard Model (SM).
The recent observation of neutral-current coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering
(CEνNS) by the COHERENT experiment [16, 17] has given access to a wide range of

new physics opportunities. This has prompted numerous proposals to search for physics
beyond the SM [18–21] with a special focus on non-standard neutrino interactions with
matter [22–28], sterile neutrinos [29–31], novel mediators [32–35] and dark matter [36, 37].
Moreover, CEνNS has been also suggested as a prominent tool towards exploring important
nuclear structure parameters [38, 39], as well as implications for physics within [40, 41] and
beyond the Standard Model [42–44]. Very recently, it has been emphasized the need for
taking into account also the incoherent channel of neutrino-nucleus scattering at momentum
transfers (q) beyond the coherency frontier, e.g. qRA  1 [45] (RA is the nuclear radius),
which are particularly relevant for neutrino floor studies at direct detection dark matter
experiments [46–48].
Here, we examine the potential of the upcoming experiments to probe neutrino magnetic
moments in their most general realization, namely transition magnetic moments (TMMs)
of Majorana neutrinos [8]. We explore the discovery potential of these experiments to subleading effects associated to neutrino TMMs through the measurement of the CEνNS event
rate. Then, upon the work presented in [49–51], we build up a dedicated study on low-energy
neutrino-nucleus processes, in the light of current and upcoming CEνNS experiments. In
particular, we examine the potential of planned reactor neutrino experiments CONUS [52],
CONNIE [53], MINER [54], TEXONO [55] and RED100 [56], and several variants of the
recent COHERENT experiment [16, 17, 57] at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) in
probing neutrino TMMs. We quantify the sensitivities expected for different target materials,
detector sizes, thresholds, efficiencies, exposure times and baseline choices. Our results are
determined on the basis of a dedicated χ2 analysis that takes into account as well the
quenching effects, relevant for high purity sub-keV threshold detectors. We conclude that
neutral-current coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering studies at these facilities offer
the capability of probing electromagnetic neutrino properties such as neutrino TMMs with
improved sensitivities, hence providing a sensitive way to test for new physics in the neutrino
sector. Beyond the analysis of CEνNS experiments, in this work we update the discussion
given in Refs. [49–51] concerning the sensitivity of ν − e scattering to the effective neutrino
magnetic moment using the solar neutrino data from the Borexino collaboration [58]. We
also briefly comment on alternatives to probe the effective neutrino magnetic moments using
other neutrino sources that contribute to the neutrino floor in dark matter direct detection
experiments, such as solar and geoneutrinos, as well as atmospheric and diffuse supernova
neutrinos.
The paper has been organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we introduce the main theoretical
background and derive the expressions for the effective neutrino magnetic moments corresponding to the various neutrino sources under study. In Sect. 3, we discuss the main
features associated with the relevant electromagnetic CEνNS processes, while in Sect. 4 we
define the experimental configurations and setups for the different CEνNS experiments of

3
interest. Our results are presented in Sect. 5. A brief discussion, including updated constraints from the recent Borexino data, and comments on other neutrino sources that might
be relevant to the neutrino floor in dark matter direct detection experiments are given in
Sect. 6. Finally, the main conclusions are given in Sect. 7.

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

The effective Hamiltonian that accounts for the spin component of the Majorana neutrino
electromagnetic vertex is expressed in terms of the electromagnetic field tensor Fαβ , as [7, 8]
1
M
HEM
= − νLT C −1 λσ αβ νL Fαβ + h.c. ,

(1)

with λ = µ − i being an antisymmetric complex matrix (λαβ = −λβα ) and, hence, µT = −µ
and T = − are two imaginary matrices. Therefore, three complex or six real parameters
are required to describe this object. The corresponding Hamiltonian relevant to the Dirac
neutrino case reads
1
D
HEM
= ν̄R λσ αβ νL Fαβ + h.c. ,
(2)
2
where λ = µ−i is a complex matrix, subject to the hermiticity constraints µ = µ† and  = † .
Comparing Eqs. (1) and (2), it becomes evident that neutrino electromagnetic properties
constitute a prime vehicle to distinguish between the Dirac and Majorana neutrino nature. In
contrast to the Dirac case, vanishing diagonal moments are implied for Majorana neutrinos,

ii = ii = 0. In the simplest SU(2)L ⊗ U(1)Y model, the Majorana magnetic and electric
transition moments (with i 6= j) take the form [9]

where GF is the Fermi coupling constant, mνi is the mass of the neutrino mass eigenstate
νi , Uαi denote the elements of the neutrino mixing matrix, while mlα and MW correspond
to the charged lepton and W boson masses, respectively.
In this work, we will focus on the study of the Majorana transition magnetic moment
M
µij . For simplicity, we will drop the superscript M referring to Majorana neutrinos from
now on. The effective neutrino magnetic moment, observable in a given experiment, can be
expressed in terms of the neutrino magnetic moment matrix and the amplitudes of positive
and negative helicity states, denoted by the 3−vectors a+ and a− , respectively. In the flavor
basis one finds [59]

In this context, the definition λαβ = εαβγ Λγ has been introduced, and the neutrino TMMs
are represented by the complex parameters [50]
Λα = |Λα |eiζα ,

Λi = |Λi |eiζi .

(7)

The effective neutrino magnetic moment in the flavor basis, shown in Eq. (5), can be translated into the mass basis through a rotation, by using the leptonic mixing matrix. Then, by
introducing the transformations
ã− = U † a− ,

ã+ = U T a+ ,

λ̃ = U T λU ,

(8)

the effective neutrino magnetic moment in the mass basis takes the form [51]

Effective neutrino magnetic moment at reactor CEνNS experiments

For CEνNS studies at reactor neutrino experiments, the only non-zero parameter entering
Eq. (5) or Eq. (9) is a1+ , corresponding to the initial ν̄e flux. Then, in the flavor basis, the
effective Majorana TMM strength parameter relevant to reactor CEνNS experiments such
as CONUS, CONNIE, MINER, TEXONO and RED100, can be cast in the form [51]
µFν̄e , reactor

2

= |Λµ |2 + |Λτ |2 ,

(10)

where |Λµ | and |Λτ | denote the elements of the neutrino transition magnetic moment matrix
λ describing the corresponding conversions from the electron antineutrino to the muon and
tau neutrino states, respectively. The above expression, in the mass basis becomes 1 [49]
2

(11)

− s12 sin 2θ13 |Λ2 ||Λ3 | cos(δCP + ζ2 − ζ3 ) ,

1

Note that, in the symmetric parametrization of the neutrino mixing matrix for Majorana neutrinos, where
U = R23 (θ23 ; φ23 ) R13 (θ13 ; φ13 ) R12 (θ12 ; φ12 ) and δCP = φ13 − φ12 − φ23 [6], all the CP phases entering
in the effective neutrino magnetic moment in Eq. (11) are of Majorana type.

5
where |Λi | and ζi are the moduli and phases characterizing the neutrino TMM matrix in
the mass basis, see Eq. (7). We have also defined |Λ|2 = |Λ1 |2 + |Λ2 |2 + |Λ3 |2 and used
the standard abbreviations cij = cos θij , sij = sin θij for the trigonometric functions of the
neutrino mixing angles. As usual, δCP refers to the Dirac CP phase of the leptonic mixing
matrix.
The expression above can be further simplified by defining a new set of phases ξi as the
differences of the TMM phases: ξ1 = ζ3 − ζ2 , ξ2 = ζ3 − ζ1 and ξ3 = ζ1 − ζ2 . Note that
ξ2 = ξ1 − ξ3 and, therefore, only two ξi phases are independent. In the following, we will
express the effective neutrino magnetic moments as a function of the δCP and ξi phases.
With this notation, the effective neutrino magnetic moment in Eq. (11) will be expressed as
µM
ν̄e , reactor

2

=|Λ|2 − c212 c213 |Λ1 |2 − s212 c213 |Λ2 |2 − s213 |Λ3 |2
− c213 sin 2θ12 |Λ1 ||Λ2 | cos ξ3

− c12 sin 2θ13 |Λ1 ||Λ3 | cos(δCP − ξ2 )

(12)

− s12 sin 2θ13 |Λ2 ||Λ3 | cos(δCP − ξ1 ) .

It is interesting to notice that a degenerate case arises when the arguments of the cosine
functions in Eq. (12) are set to zero. Indeed, in this particular case one has [60]
µM
ν̄e , reactor

2

= |Λ|2 − (c12 c13 |Λ1 | + s12 c13 |Λ2 | + s13 |Λ3 |)2 ,

(13)

that will vanish for the following values of |Λi |
|Λ1 | = c12 c13 |Λ|,

|Λ2 | = s12 c13 |Λ|,

|Λ3 | = s13 |Λ|.

(14)

Hence, for this special case, reactor experiments become insensitive to the neutrino magnetic
moment.

2.2.

Effective neutrino magnetic moment at SNS facilities

We now focus on DAR-π neutrinos produced at the SNS and we express the relevant
neutrino magnetic moment accordingly. Assuming the same proportion of delayed (νe , ν̄µ )
and prompt (νµ ) neutrinos at the SNS, the relevant non-zero amplitudes are a1− = 1, a2+ = 1
and a2− = 1, respectively. In Ref. [49], the authors explored TMMs at neutrino-electron scattering experiments and obtained their results by assuming all relevant non-vanishing helicity
amplitudes at accelerator neutrino facilities. In contrast, in the present work, by exploiting
the fact that the SNS employs a pulsed beam and can therefore distinguish between the
prompt and delayed neutrino fluxes [26, 42], we consider separately the TMMs corresponding to the prompt and the delayed flux. For prompt neutrinos at the SNS (e.g. the only

6
non-vanishing entry being a2− = 1), the effective magnetic moment strength parameter in
the flavor basis is expressed as

F
µνµ , prompt = |Λe |2 + |Λτ |2 ,

while for delayed neutrinos (a1− = 1, a2+ = 1) we find

Notice from Eqs.(12) and (17)–(19) that the factors accompanying |Λi | involve different CP
phase and mixing angle combinations for the DAR-π and reactor CEνNS experiments. This
will have a direct impact on the results presented in Sect. 5.

ELECTROMAGNETIC CONTRIBUTION TO CEνNS

Within the SM, the interaction of a neutrino with energy Eν scattered coherently upon a
nucleus (A, Z) is theoretically well studied [45, 61–63]. The CEνNS cross section is usually
expressed in terms of the nuclear recoil energy TA , as [64]

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

We find it useful to devote a separate section to discuss the main features of our calculation
procedure. For ionization detectors, a significant part of the nuclear recoil energy is lost into
heat, so the measured energy (electron equivalent energy) is lower. We take into account this
energy loss by considering the quenching factor Q(TA ), that is calculated from the Lindhard
theory [71]

Here, we not only examine the sensitivity of CEνNS experiments to TMMs according
to their current setup, but also explore their long-term prospects. To this purpose, we
also consider a future experimental setup with larger detector mass, improved threshold
capabilities and an increased time of exposure. Note that, even in the adopted future setups,
the input values follow the proposal of each experiment. Therefore, they are quite realistic,
leading to reasonable projected sensitivities. The details of the assumed experimental setups
are shown in Table I.

Reactor Neutrinos

In reactor neutrino experiments, electron antineutrinos are generated by the beta-decay
of the fission products of 235 U, 238 U, 239 Pu and 241 Pu. We calculate the energy distribution
fν̄e (Eν ) by employing the expansion of Ref. [72], whereas for energies below 2 MeV, due to
lack of experimental data, we consider the theoretical calculations given in Ref. [73]. The
neutrino flux Φν depends on the power of the reactor plant and the baseline for the relevant
experiment (see Refs. [52–56]). In all cases we assume a flat detector efficiency of 50% in
the event identification and a benchmark of 1 yr data taking.

Neutrinos at the Spallation Neutron Source

The first CEνNS measurement by COHERENT became feasible by employing a CsI[Na]
detector with mass mdet = 14.57 kg located at a baseline of L = 19.3 m from the DAR-π
source with an exposure time of 308.1 days. Following the recipe of the COHERENT data
release [17], we adequately simulate the DAR-π neutrino spectra in terms of the pion and
muon masses, mπ and mµ , following the Michel spectrum [74]

where Eνmax ≤ mµ /2 ≈ 52.8 MeV. The latter accounts for the monochromatic muon neutrino
beam (Eν = 29.9 MeV) produced from pion decay at rest, π + → µ+ νµ (prompt flux with
τ = 26 ns), and the subsequent νe and ν̄µ neutrino beams resulting from muon decay µ+ →
νe e+ ν̄µ (delayed flux with τ = 2.2 µs) [75]. The neutrino flux is Φν = rNPOT /4πL2 , with
r = 0.08 representing the number of neutrinos per flavor produced for each proton on target
(POT), e.g. NPOT = 1.76 × 1023 corresponding to the 308.1 days of exposure during the first
run. For the future COHERENT detector subsystems HPGe, LAr and NaI[Tl], we assume
an exposure period of 1 yr, which corresponds to NPOT = 2.09 × 1023 .
The COHERENT signal was detected through photoelectron (PE) measurements, hence,
in our simulations we translate the energy of the scattered nucleus TA in terms of the number
of the observed PE, nPE , through the relation [16]
nPE = 1.17

NUMERICAL RESULTS

For a given CEνNS experiment, the total cross section is evaluated as a sum of the
individual cross sections corresponding to each isotope composing the detector material. By
taking into account the stoichiometric ratio of the atom, η, and the detector mass, mdet , the
number of target nuclei per isotope is evaluated through Avogadro’s number, NA

In order to extract the current constraints on TMMs |Λi | from the first phase of COHERENT (with a CsI detector), we perform a statistical analysis using the following χ2

Here, the measured number of events is Nmeas = 142, while a1 and a2 are the systematic
parameters accounting for the uncertainties on the signal and background rates, respectively,
with fractional uncertainties σa1 = 0.28 and σa2 = 0.25. Following Ref. [16], the statistical

uncertainty is given by σstat = Nmeas + B0n + 2Bss , where the quantities B0n = 6 and
Bss = 405 denote the beam-on prompt neutron and the steady-state background events
respectively. Our statistical analysis regarding reactor as well as the next generation of
COHERENT CEνNS experiments, within the framework of current and future setups, is
based on a single nuisance parameter. In this case, the χ2 function is defined as

FIG. 2: ∆χ2 profiles for every element of the TMM matrix, |Λi |, at CEνNS experiments
for vanishing |Λj |, |Λk | and all phases set to zero. The results in the upper (lower) panel
are for SNS (reactor) neutrino experiments in their current setup. The color bands in the
upper panels indicate the limits expected from each SNS experiment.

We begin our sensitivity analysis by considering a single non-vanishing TMM parameter
|Λi | at a time, in the current setup. As a first step, for the sake of simplicity, in our
calculations we set all complex phases to zero, assuming all TMMs as real parameters.
We will discuss the impact of non-zero phases on our reported sensitivities at the end of
this section. The extracted constraints from the first CEνNS measurement in CsI along
with the projected sensitivities from the next phase HPGe, LAr and NaI[Tl] COHERENT
subsystems, are shown in the upper panel of Fig. 2 for prompt and delayed neutrinos. From
the first run of the COHERENT experiment, the following 90% C.L. bounds are obtained

On the other hand, the lower panel of Fig. 2 presents the corresponding projected sensitivity from the reactor CEνNS experiments CONUS, CONNIE, MINER, TEXONO and
RED100. The results presented in Fig. 2 indicate that the prospects for probing electromagnetic neutrino properties are better for reactor-based experiments. This is a direct
consequence of their sub-keV recoil threshold capabilities in conjunction with the fact that
the reactor neutrino energy distribution is peaked at much lower energies, compared to
DAR-π neutrinos. We stress, however, that when considering the full SNS beam, instead of
the individual prompt and delayed components, this difference is reduced significantly. As

in the current setup. We also display the projected sensitivities for the HPGe, LAr and
NaI[Tl] detector subsystems of COHERENT. The color labeling is same as in Fig. 2.

an illustrative example, by assuming the full SNS beam in the current configuration of the
CsI detector, the corresponding 90% C.L. upper bounds on (|Λ1 |, |Λ2 |, |Λ3 |) are (42.8, 40.0,
43.6) in units of 10−10 µB . Similarly, for the future detector materials of COHERENT, the
projected sensitivities read, Ge: (16.5, 15.3, 16.6), LAr: (8.9, 8.4, 9.1) and NaI: (8.6, 8.0,
8.6), all in units of 10−10 µB .
For completeness, we now examine the attainable sensitivity for different values of the
factor F which corresponds to the luminosity of each studied experiment, entering in the
calculation of the event number in Eq. (33). To be conservative, we fix all other inputs to
their default values according to the current setup and, as previously, we assume all TMMs to
be real. We then calculate the sensitivities on |Λi | for SNS and reactor CEνNS experiments
by scaling-up our simulations with the new luminosity factor F 0 . With this approach, it
becomes feasible to probe the sensitivity on TMMs for several combinations of detector mass,
exposure period, detector baselines and power of the source. To motivate this approach, we
recall that the SNS should increase its operation power and also that MINER is planning
towards a moveable core strategy. Our corresponding results are depicted in Fig. 3. They

F 0 /F . 40, whereas beyond that point the improvement becomes weaker.
We are now interested in exploring simultaneous constraints on the effective neutrino
magnetic moment parameters from the current as well as projected CEνNS data, according to the setups reported in Table I. Assuming two real non-vanishing TMMs at a time,
in Fig. 4 we present the allowed regions in the |Λi | − |Λj | plane extracted from the available CsI COHERENT data for the prompt and delayed beams. The corresponding regions
for the next generation of COHERENT detectors are also shown. As can be seen from
the plot, the installation of LAr and NaI[Tl] detector subsystems will offer improvements
of about one order of magnitude, after one year of data taking. Figure 5 shows the projected sensitivities expected at various detector subsystems of COHERENT in the future
setup, with an improvement of at least one order of magnitude. As commented above, a
combined analysis of the full SNS beam, would have the potential to place even stronger
limits. Turning now to reactor-based CEνNS experiments, we perform a similar analysis as
previously described and present the projected sensitivities assuming the current (future)
setup in the upper (lower) panel of Fig. 6. In both cases, the two-dimensional contour plots
confirm that CEνNS experiments can be regarded as suitable facilities to probe Majorana
electromagnetic properties with improved sensitivity. Indeed, as we will see in Sect. 6, with
the next-generation upgrades, future measurements will have the potential to significantly

improve upon the best current constraints, obtained from Borexino solar neutrino data. Finally, from Figs. 4-6, one sees that the resulting sensitivities have a slightly different shape
in the |Λ2 | − |Λ3 | plane compared to the other two panels for the case of SNS neutrinos. On
the other hand, reactor neutrino experiments show a similar but more pronounced effect in
the |Λ1 | − |Λ2 | plane. This is due to its stronger dependence on the mixing angles and CP
phases.
Before closing our discussion concerning the prospects of probing TMMs at CEνNS facilities, we examine the robustness of our results by exploring the impact of the CP phases on
the derived sensitivities in the |Λi | − |Λj | plane. As before, we assume a vanishing value for
the remaining |Λk |. As an illustrative example, Fig. 7 shows the different 90% C.L. contours
in the current setup obtained from the prompt beam at the COHERENT experiment (upper panel) and the projected reactor neutrino experiment CONNIE (lower panel). For SNS
neutrinos, we have verified that the most conservative sensitivity (outer curve) corresponds
to ξk = 0 and δCP = π, while the strongest one (inner curve) corresponds to ξk = π and
δCP = 0. On the other hand, for reactor neutrinos the most conservative sensitivity contour
(outer curve) corresponds to ξk = δCP = 0, while the most aggressive one (inner curve) is
obtained for ξk = π and δCP = 0. All calculations refer to the current configuration, so that

COMPARISON WITH THE CURRENT BOREXINO LIMIT

As already discussed, the neutrino magnetic moment observable at a given experiment
is actually an effective parameter depending on the neutrino mixing parameters as well as
the oscillation factor describing the neutrino propagation between the source and detection
points [12, 69], i.e.

Note that, for the case of the short baseline CEνNS experiments discussed in the previous
sections, the oscillation factor can be safely ignored, since there is no time for neutrino
oscillations to develop.
To compare our results with current limits on TMMs, we analyze the recent solar neutrino
data from Borexino phase-II [58] (see also Refs. [77–79]). In this case, the expression for the

the effective neutrino magnetic moment was reported: µM

ν, sol < 2.8×10
can be directly translated into a limit on the TMM parameters |Λi |, as presented in Fig. 8.
There, we show the corresponding 90% C.L. bounds in the two-dimensional (|Λi |,|Λj |) plane
when the third element |Λk | is set to zero.

Before closing, it is worth mentioning that the effective neutrino magnetic moments can
be also studied in other rare-event experiments. This is well-motivated by the improved
precision expected in the next generation of oscillation and dark matter direct detection
experiments, see Ref. [80]. In this framework, interesting neutrino sources such as geoneutrinos, atmospheric neutrinos and diffuse supernova background neutrinos that contribute
to the “neutrino floor” at dark matter detectors can be envisaged. They would be expected
to provide complementary information on neutrino electromagnetic properties.

Note our Eq. (38) differs from Eq. (7) of Ref. [58].

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we have examined the potential of the current and next generation of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering experiments in probing neutrino magnetic moment
interactions. We have performed a detailed statistical analysis to determine the sensitivities
on the three elements of the Majorana neutrino transition magnetic moment matrix, |Λi |,
that follow from low-energy neutrino-nucleus experiments. We have used for the first time
the CEνNS measurement by the COHERENT experiment at the Spallation Neutron Source
in order to constrain the Majorana neutrino transition magnetic moments. By assuming the
future setup upgrades in Table I we have also presented the expected sensitivities for the
next phases of COHERENT using HPGe, LAr and NaI[Tl] detectors, as well as for reactor
neutrino experiments such as CONUS, CONNIE, MINER, TEXONO and RED100. Our

20
results for the current and future sensitivities on the TMM elements |Λi | are illustrated in
Figs. 2 to 6 and summarized in Table II. From the table, one sees that improvements of at
least one order of magnitude compared to the current setup might be expected from future
CEνNS measurements. Indeed, our results show that the next generation CEνNS experiments has promising prospects to probe TMMs at the 10−11 µB level at least. It follows
that upcoming reactor-based CEνNS experiments with low-threshold capabilities have the
potential to compete with the current limits from ν̄e − e scattering data derived in Ref. [49]
or with the best current limit reported from Borexino, and translated to our general parameterization in Sect. 6 (see also the last row of Table II). As a final remark, we comment that,
although the results reported in Table II have been obtained under the assumption of real
TMMs, we have also discussed the role of the CP violating phases.
