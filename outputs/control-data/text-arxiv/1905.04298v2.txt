GALOIS ACTION ON HOMOLOGY OF GENERALIZED FERMAT
CURVES
ARISTIDES KONTOGEORGIS AND PANAGIOTIS PARAMANTZOGLOU

Abstract. The fundamental group of Fermat and generalized Fermat curves
is computed. These curves are Galois ramified covers of the projective line
with abelian Galois groups H. We provide a unified study of the action of
both cover Galois group H and the absolute Galois group Gal(Q̄/Q) on the
pro-ℓ homology of the curves in study. Also the relation to the pro-ℓ Burau
representation is investigated.

1. Introduction
In [15] we have studied the actions of the braid group and of the absolute Galois
group on a cyclic cover of the projective line. In that article we have exploited the
fact that in a ramified cover X → P1 of the projective line we can remove the ramified points and in this way we obtain an open cover X 0 → Xs := P1 \{P1 , . . . , Ps } of
the projective line minus the ramified points. Fix a point x0 ∈ Xs and an arbitrary
but fixed preimage x′0 ∈ X 0 . By covering space theory the open curve X 0 can
be described as a quotient of the universal covering space X̃s by the fundamental
group of the open curve π1 (X 0 , x′0 ) < π1 (Xs , x0 ) ∼
= Fs−1 , where Fs−1 is the free
group in s−1 generators. Also the group π1 (X 0 , x′0 ) can be described as a subgroup
of Fs−1 by using the Screier lemma technique, see [15, sec. 3].
Y. Ihara in [12], [11] observed that for a fixed prime ℓ, if we pass to the proℓ completions of the fundamental groups of the above curves, then the absolute
Galois group Gal(Q̄/Q) can be realized as a group of automorphisms of Fs−1 and it
can also act on certain subgroups Fs−1 , corresponding to topological covers of Xs ,
here by Fs−1 we denote the free pro-ℓ group in s − 1 generators. The fundamental
group of Xs admits the presentation
π1 (Xs , x0 ) ∼
= hx1 , . . . , xs |x1 x2 · · · xs = 1i.
In this way we can unify the study of both Braid group and the absolute Galois
group on (co)homology spaces of cyclic curves. In [15, thm. 1] the fundamental
group Rℓk of the open cyclic cover Yℓk of the projective line minus s-points is
computed to be equal to

Definition 1. Given a group F we will denote by F ′ the derived subgroup of F ,
that is F ′ = [F, F ].

In this article we continue this study by focusing on the case of certain abelian
coverings of the projective line. We begin by studying the classical Fermat curves
Fern given as projective algebraic curves by the equation
Fern := {[x : y : z] ∈ P3 : xn + y n + z n = 0}.
The Fermat curve Fern forms a ramified Galois cover of the projective line ramified
over three points, {0, 1, ∞} with Galois group H0 = Z/nZ × Z/nZ. More precisely
the fundamental group of X3 = P1 \{0, 1, ∞} is isomorphic to the free group F2 in
two generators a, b. Here we may fix a point x0 in X3 and take as a, b the homotopy
classes of loops circling once clockwise around the points 0, 1 of P1 . There is also a
third loop c circling around ∞, but the homotopy class of this loop can be expressed
in terms of a, b in terms of the relation abc = 1. When we remove the preimages of
the three ramified points {0, 1, ∞} from Fern we obtain the open Fermat curve Fer0n ,
which is a topological covering of X3 . Let RFern = π1 (Fer0n , x′0 ) be the fundamental
group of the open Fermat curve Fer0n and x′0 ∈ Fer0n is a fixed preimage of the point
x0 ∈ X3 . The group RFern is known to be isomorphic to han , bn , [a, b]i < F2 , while
H0 = F2 /RFern = F2 /han , bn , [a, b]i.
Using this quotient we can define the following generators for the group H0 , namely
′
α = aRFern and β = bRFern . Let RFer
denote the commutator group of the
n
fundamental group RFern of Fern . The group F2 acts on F2 by conjugation, that
is for every two elements x, y ∈ F2 we define xy = yxy −1 . Notice also that the
′
homology group RFern /RFer
becomes an H0 -module by defining
n
′
.
xα = axa−1 , xβ = bxb−1 for x ∈ RFern /RFer
n

This action is well defined and independent of the selection of the representative of
the class α, β ∈ H0 .
Theorem 2. The fundamental group RFern of the open Fermat curve Fer0n is the
subgroup of the free group F2 = ha, bi on the generators

where Jhαi (resp. Jhαi ) denotes the coaugmentation module for the cyclic group hαi

The proof of the above theorem can be found in section 2.2 and in particular in
proposition 16.
The generalized Fermat curves play the role of Fermat curves in the more general
setting of abelian coverings of Xs = P1 \{P1 , . . . , Ps }, s > 3. Their automorphism
group was recently studied by R. Hidalgo, M. Leyton-Álvarez and the authors in
[10].
A generalized Fermat curve of type (k, s − 1), where k, s − 1 ≥ 2 are integers,
is a non-singular irreducible projective algebraic curve Ck,s−1 defined over a field
k admitting a group of automorphisms H0 ∼
= (Z/kZ)s−1 so that Ck,s−1 /H0 is
the projective line with exactly s branch points, each one with ramification index
k. Such a group H0 is called a generalized Fermat group of type (k, s − 1). Let
us consider a branched regular covering π : Ck,s−1 → P1 , whose deck group is
H0 . Let Rk,s−1 be the fundamental group of the open generalized Fermat curve
0
Ck,s−1
= Ck,s−1 \π −1 (Xs ) of type (k, s − 1).
By composing by a suitable Möbius transformation (that is, an element of
PSL2 (C)) at the left of π, we may assume that the branch values of π are given by
the points ∞, 0, 1, λ1 , . . . , λs−3 , where λi ∈ C\{0, 1} are pairwise different, that is
we can take Xs = P1 \{∞, 0, 1, λ1, . . . , λs−3 }, s > 3.
A generalized Fermat curve of type (k, s − 1) can be seen as a complete intersection in a projective space Ps−1 , defined by the following set of equations

Observe that topologically the construction of generalized Fermat curves does not
depend on the configuration of the ramification points. On the other hand the
Riemann surface/algebraic curve structure depends heavily on this configuration.
For instance the automorphism group depends on the configuration of these points,
see [10].
The genus of Ck,s−1 can be computed using the Riemann-Hurwitz formula:

g(k,s−1) = 1 +

((s − 2)(k − 1) − 2).

It is known [6] that generalized Fermat curves, have the orbifold uniformization
H/Γ in terms of the Fuchsian group
(5)

Γk = hx1 , x2 , . . . , xs | xk1 = · · · = xks = x1 x2 · · · xs = 1i.

The surface group is given, see [6], [18] as Fs−1 · hxk1 , . . . , xks−1 , (x1 · · · xs−1 )k i. We
will compute the genus of the generalized Fermat curves by two more different
methods in eq. 19 and in section 5.1.2.
Recall that Rk,s−1 denotes the fundamental group of the open generalized Fermat

curve Ck,s−1
and set Fs−1,k = Fs−1 /Rk , where Rk is the smallest closed subgroup

Proof. This theorem is proved using the Schreier lemma in section 2.3. The transition from the first set of generators of eq. (6) to the second set of non free generators
of eq. (7) is done in proposition 21.

In our pro-ℓ setting we are interested in generalized Fermat curves of type (ℓk , s−

Let k ⊂ C and let k̄ be the algebraic closure of k. The generalized Fermat curves
behave in general in the same way if k is a field of characteristic p 6= ℓ, but in this
article we need to use fundamental groups and the theory of covering spaces so it is
easier to assume that k ⊂ C, instead of working with algebraic fundamental groups
in the sense of Grothendieck [7], [8]. In general there will be no difference if we
work over a field of characteristic zero.

where k̄(Cℓk ,s−1 )unrab is the maximal abelian unramified extension of the function
field k̄(Cℓk ,s−1 ).
Proof. The group theoretic interpretation of homology given in eq. (8) is proved in
section 5.1. The analysis into characters is proved in section 4 and in particular in
proposition 35.

We would like to construct a “curve” Cs which is a Galois cover of the projective
line ramified over the set of s-points with Galois group Gal(Cs /P1 ) = Zℓs−1 . This
“curve” can only be defined as the limit case of the generalized Fermat curves
Cℓk ,s−1 .
We can avoid the definition of such
a “curve” by working in the language
of (infinite) Galois extensions of function fields as shown on the diagram on
the right.
In this way instead of considering a
simple generalized Fermat cover we
consider all of them, together.

The situation is similar with the pro-ℓ Burau representation, defined in [15]. We
also in section 5.1.5 how we can pass from the Zℓs−1 -covers corresponding to generalized Fermat curves, to the Zℓ -case corresponding to the pro-ℓ Burau representation,
using the ideas of [16].
Section 2 is devoted to the application of Schreier lemma to Fermat curves 2.1
and generalized Fermat curves 2.3 and the computation of homology by passing
to the abelianization of the fundamental group. Section 3 is an introduction to
Ihara’s ideas on the study of the absolute Galois groups as a profinite braid [11], [12]
following [14]. In section 4.1 we compute the Alexander module for the generalized
Fermat curves, while section 5 is devoted to the Zℓs−1 cover of the projective line,
seen as a limit of Cℓk ,s−1 curves and the relation to the Tate modules of them.
Finally we consider the passage to the Burau representation by comparing the
corresponding Crowell sequences, in terms of the viewpoint developed in [16].

thorough report and all remarks and corrections, which significantly contributed to
improving our article.
1.1. Geometric Interpretation. We consider a Galois covering π : Ȳ → P1 of
the projective line ramified above the points in S ⊂ P1Q̄ , and the corresponding
covering of compact Riemann surfaces. We also assume that the genus g of Ȳ is
≥ 2. The curve Y0 = Ȳ \π −1 (S) is a topological covering of Xs = P1C \S, which
can be described in terms of covering theory and corresponds to a subgroup R0 of
pro−ℓ
π1 (P1C \S) ∼
(P1C ). Denote by R̄0 the closure of R0 in π1pro−ℓ (P1C ).
= π1 (P1Q̄ \S) → π1
We have seen in [15] and we will see in section 2.1 how this group R0 can be
computed by using the Schreier lemma. For an application of this method to cyclic
covers of the projective line we refer to [15]. In order to pass from the open curve
to the corresponding closed Riemann surface we consider the quotient by the group
Γ, which is the closure in the subgroup of Fs−1 generated by the stabilizers of
ramification points, that is
Γ = hxe11 , . . . , xess i,

(9)

where e1 , . . . , es are the ramification indices of the ramification points of π : Ȳ → P1 .
In this article for some elements g1 , . . . , gt in a certain group we will denote by
hg1 , . . . , gt i the closed subgroup generated by the elements {g1 , . . . , gt }.
Notice that if e1 = e2 = · · · = es then Γ is the closure of the group Γk defined
in eq. (5). Later, for e1 = . . . = es = ℓk we will denote this group by Rk . The
group R = R0 /R0 ∩ Γ corresponds to the closed curve Ȳ as a quotient of the
hyperbolic plane. This geometric situation can be expressed in terms of the short
exact sequence of groups where the map ψ is the natural onto map defined by
sending aΓ 7→ aR̄0 · Γ.

In this article we focus on the study of Fermat and generalized Fermat curves.
Namely, in sections 2.1 and 2.3 we compute the fundamental group of the corresponding curves. We also treat the classical Fermat curves s = 3 since this

computation is elementary, while for the generalized Fermat curves s ≥ 3 more advanced tools are needed, namely the usage of Alexander modules and the Crowell
exact sequence.
2. Generalized Fermat Curves
2.1. Fermat Curves. These curves are ramified curves over P1 \{0, 1, ∞} with
deck group Z/nZ × Z/nZ. We have π1 (P1 \{0, 1, ∞}, x0) ∼
= ha, bi. This curve
= F2 ∼
is a generalized Fermat curve Cn,s−1 for s = 3.
Definition 5. The commutator [a, b] of two elements a, b in a group is defined as
[a, b] = aba−1 b−1 .
Lemma 6. For any two elements x, y of a group and any positive integer j we have

Proof. See [5, 0.1 p.1].



We will employ the Schreier lemma for describing the fundamental group of the
Fermat curve of level n, as explained in [15, sec. 3]. More precisely a (right)
Schreier Transversal of a subgroup H of a free group Fs−1 = hx1 , . . . , xs−1 i with
basis X = {x1 , . . . , xs−1 } is a set T = {t1 = 1, . . . , tn } of reduced words such that
each right coset of H in Fs−1 contains a unique word of T called the representative of
this class and all initial segments of these words also lie in T . For every g ∈ Fs−1 we
will denote by ḡ the element of T with the property Hg = H ḡ. Schreier’s lemma, see
−1
[15, lemma 6] asserts that H is freely generated by the elements γ(t, x) := txtx ,
t ∈ T , x ∈ X and tx 6∈ T , γ(t, x) 6= 1.
A Schreier transversal T for the subgroup RFern ⊂ F2 such that F2 /RFern ∼
=
Z/nZ × Z/nZ is given by ai bj , 0 ≤ i, j ≤ n − 1. The fundamental group of the
Fermat curve is isomorphic to RFern .
Lemma 7. The group RFern is characteristic, that is every automorphism σ ∈
AutF2 keeps RFern invariant.
Proof. The group RFern ⊂ F2 = ha, bi, can be generated by the elements an , bn , [a, b].
The automorphism group of the free group Fn , and in particular of F2 , is generated by Nielsen transformations ni and nij [4, th. 1.5 p. 125] which are defined
as follows: The automorphism ni sends a free generator xi 7→ x−1
and leaves all
i
other generators unchanged while the automorphism nij sends xi 7→ xi xj and leaves
all other generators unchanged. It is evident from the relations of RFern , see also
lemma 8, that ni (RFern ) = RFern and nij (RFern ) = RFern .

#A3 = n

Proof. This is a direct consequence of the Schreier lemma. Notice also that the
above given sets together give rise to n2 + 1 generators as predicted by Schreier
index formula. Indeed, we compute #A1 +#A2 +#A3 = n+(n−1)2+n = n2 +1. 

Every ramification point of the Fermat curve is surrounded by a path γi and there
are 3n such paths. We can verify that our computation is correct so far, by computing the genus of the closed Fermat curve. We add the 3n missing points and
we observe that the rank of RFern equals 2g + 3n − 1 so the Schreier index formula

Remark 17. The short exact sequence is in some sense a generalization of the

We will now employ the Schreier lemma [4, chap. 2 sec. 8], [19, sec. 2.3 th. 2.7]
in order to compute the free subgroup Rk,s−1 ⊂ Fs−1 , where Rk,s−1 is the subgroup
of Fs−1 corresponding to the curve Ck,s−1 and is isomorphic to the fundamental
group of Ck,s−1 . We will introduce some new notation first:
Definition 18. For any i := (i1 , . . . , is−1 ) ∈ Zs−1 , define
i

s−1
xi := xi11 xi22 · · · xs−1

We also set
e1 = (1, 0, . . . , 0), e2 = (0, 1, . . . , 0), . . . , es−1 = (0, . . . , 0, 1).
Lemma 19. A Schreier Transversal for Rk,s−1 < Fs−1 is given by
T = {xi : i = (i1 , . . . , ij , . . . , is−1 ) ∈ Zs−1 and 0 ≤ ij ≤ k − 1},

For ν+1 = s−1 the desired equality is trivial. We will use the following commutator

Similarly to the computation of the classical Fermat curves we change to a more
suitable basis.
Proposition 21. Recall that i = (i1 , . . . , is−1 ), 0 ≤ i1 , . . . , is−1 ≤ k − 1. A gener′
ating set for Rk,s−1 /Rk,s−1
is given by
i

Ãs−1 = {(xks−1 )ξ1,s−2 }
i

i

Ãν = {(xkν )ξ1,ν−1 ·ξν+1,s−1 }, for 1 ≤ ν ≤ s − 2
i

Ã′ν = {[xj , xν ]ξ1,s−1 }, for 0 ≤ j < ν ≤ s − 1, 1 ≤ ij , iν ≤ k − 2.
Proof. Notice that eq. (13) for i 6= ν implies that

The result follows using the generating set given in eq. (16), lemma 20 and eq.
(18).

Remark 22. For the homology of the closed curve we have:
H1 (Ck,s−1 , Z) =

′
Rk,s−1 /Rk,s−1
.
hγ1 , . . . , γsks−1 i

Using eq. (4) and the fact that rank H1 (Ck,s−1 , Z) = 2gCk,s−1 it is easy to verify
that
(19)

(s − 2)k s−1 + 1 − (s · k s−2 − 1) = 2gCk,s−1 .

In the above formula we have subtracted one from the number of invariant elements
γi since γ1 · · · γsks−2 = 1.
Describing the action in this case is not as straightforward as it was for the case
of classical Fermat curve. We will use the theory of Alexander modules instead and
postpone this computation to section 4.1.

3. On the representation of Ihara
3.1. Pro-ℓ braid groups. Let ℓ be a prime number and let Fs denote the pro-ℓ
free group with s free generators. Let S ⊂ P1Q̄ be a set consisted of s points, s ≥ 3,
on the projective line and suppose that P ∈ Q for all P ∈ S − {∞}. In this way
the absolute Galois group corresponds to “pure braids”. Ihara in [11] introduced
the monodromy representation
IhS : Gal(Q̄/Q) → Aut(Fs−1 ).
pro−ℓ
(P1Q̄ − S) is the pro-ℓ étale fundamental group and is
Here the group Fs−1 ∼
= π1
known to admit a presentation
V

(20)

Fs−1 = hx1 , . . . , xs |x1 x2 · · · xs = 1i,
V

where · denotes the pro-ℓ completion of a finitely generated group. Given a set
{xi , i ∈ I} in a topological group we will denote by hxi , i ∈ Ii the topological
closure of the group generated by the group elements xi , i ∈ I. In [11] Ihara
studied the case S = {0, 1, ∞}. This is an interesting case since by Belyi’s theorem
[2] the branched covers of P1 \{0, 1, ∞} are exactly the curves defined over Q̄. The
case s ≥ 3 is also interesting and was also considered by Ihara, see [13]. Using
a Möbious transformation we can assume that the set S consists of the elements
0, 1, λ1 , · · · , λs−3 , ∞.
The Ihara representation can be explained in terms of Galois theory as follows:
Consider the maximal pro-ℓ extension M of Q(t) unramified outside the set S. The
Galois group Gal(M /Q̄(t)) is known to be isomorphic to the pro-ℓ free group Fs−1
of rank s − 1. A selection of generators x1 , . . . , xs−1 corresponds to an isomorphism
i : Fs−1 → Gal(M /Q̄(t)), such that i(xν ) (1 ≤ ν ≤ s) generates the inertia group
of some place ξν of M extending the place Pi of Q̄(t), corresponding to the i-th
element of the set S.
We have the following exact equence:

Every element ρ ∈ Gal(Q̄/Q) gives rise to an element ρ∗ ∈ Gal(M /Q(t)), which
is unique up to an element of Gal(M /Q̄(t)), and so we obtain an isomorphism
x 7→ ρ∗ xρ−1 ∈ P̃ (Fs−1 )/Int(Fs−1 ), where

P̃ (Fs−1 ) := φ ∈ Aut(Fs−1 )|φ(xi ) ∼ xi

Y. Ihara [11, p.52], proved that the action of σ ∈ Gal(Q̄/Q) on the topological
generators of Fs−1 is in P̃ (Fs−1 ) that is
N (σ)

σ(xi ) = wi (σ)xi

where N (σ) ∈ Z∗ℓ and wi (σ) ∈ Fs−1 is the element defining the conjugation. In this

By selecting the representatives of elements P̃ (Fs−1 ) we can define the Ihara

where ≈ denotes conjugacy by an element of the subgroup of Fs generated by the

character χℓ : Gal(Q̄/Q) → Z∗ℓ . For more details on these constructions see [11,
prop.3 p.55], [14, prop. 2.2.2].
3.2. Magnus embedding. We will explain now the Magnus embedding following
[14]. This embedding is given by the map
(23)

Fs−1 → Zℓ [[u1 , u2 , . . . , us−1 ]]nc

of Fs−1 into the “non-commutative” formal power series algebra (xi 7→1 + ui for
1 ≤ i ≤ s − 1). Let H denote the abelianization of Fs−1 , and H the abelianization
of Fs−1
H := gr1 (Fs−1 ) = H1 (Fs−1 , Z)

H =: gr1 (Fs−1 ) = H1 (Fs−1 , Zℓ ) = H ⊗Z Zℓ .

The term gr1 above has its origin on the graded Lie algebra corresponding to a
(pro-ℓ) free group, see [11, p. 58] and [17]. Following [14], [20] we consider the
tensor algebras
M
M
T (H) =
H ⊗n ,
T (H) =
H⊗n ,

⊗n

where H = Zℓ and H
:= H ⊗Zℓ · · · ⊗Zℓ H (n-times) (resp. H 0 = Z, H ⊗n =
H ⊗Z · · · ⊗Z H) ). If u0 , . . . , us−1 is a Zℓ basis of the free Zℓ -module H, then
T (H) = Zℓ hu1 , . . . , us−1 i,

is the non-commutative polynomial algebra Zℓ [[u1 , u2 , . . . , us−1 ]]nc over Zℓ , appearing in the right hand side of eq. (23).
We will denote by Tb(H) the completion of T (H) with respect to the m-adic
topology, where m is the two sided ideal generated by u1 , . . . , us−1 and ℓ. This
algebra is the algebra of non-commutative formal power series over Zℓ with variables
u1 , . . . , us−1 :
Y
Tb(H) =
H⊗n = Zℓ hhu1 , . . . , us−1 ii.

Let Zℓ [[Fs−1 ]] be the complete group algebra of Fs−1 over Zℓ , and let
εZℓ [[Fs−1 ]] : Zℓ [[Fs−1 ]] → Zℓ

be the augmentation homomorphism. Denote by IZℓ [[Fs−1 ]] := ker εZℓ [[Fs−1 ]] the
augmentation ideal. The correspodence xi 7→ 1 + ui for 1 ≤ i ≤ s − 1 induces an
isomorphism of topological Zℓ -algebras, the pro-ℓ Magnus isomorphism.

Example 23. The map Θ sendsPZℓ [Z] = Zℓ [t, t−1 ] to Zℓ [[u]] by mapping Θ(t) =
∞
1 + u and Θ(t−1 ) = (1 + u)−1 = i=0 (−1)i ui . The image Θ(Zℓ [t, t−1 ]) is not onto
T̂ (H), but Zℓ [[Zℓ ]] = Zℓ [[F1 ]] is mapped isomorphically to T̂ (H) by Θ.
For an multiindex I = (i1 , . . . , is−1 ) we set uI = ui1 · · · uis−1 . The coefficient of
uI in Θ(α) is called the Magnus coefficient of α and it is denoted by µ(I, α), that
is
X
µ(I, α)uI .
Θ(α) = εZℓ [[Fs−1 ]] (α) +
|I|≥1

For certain properties of the Magnus embedding and a fascinating application to
ℓ-adic Milnor invariants we refer to [20, chap. 8], [14, sec. 3.2].
3.3. Milnor invariants. Consider the group H := Fab
s−1 = Fs−1 /[Fs−1 , Fs−1 ]. For
f ∈ Fs−1 denote by [f ] its image in H. We will write H as an additive Zℓ -module,
which is generated by [u1 ], . . . , [us−1 ]. Notice that the following relation holds:
[u1 ] + · · · + [us−1 ] + [us ] = 0.
Every automorphism φ ∈ Aut(Fs−1 ) gives rise to a linear automorphism of the free
Zℓ -module H and we will denote it by [φ] ∈ GL(H).
Lemma 24. The elements wi (σ) ∈ Fs−1 can be selected uniquely so that
χ (σ)

(1) IhS (σ)(xi ) = wi (σ)xi ℓ wi (σ)−1 , where χℓ is the ℓ-cyclotomic character.

(2) In the expression [wi (σ)] = c1 [u1 ] + · · · + cs−1 [us−1 ], cj ∈ Zℓ , we have



For a multiindex I = (i1 , . . . , in ), 1 ≤ i1 , . . . , in ≤ s − 1 the ℓ-adic Milnor
number for σ ∈ Gal(Q̄/Q) is defined as the ℓ-adic Magnus coefficient of wi (σ), for
I ′ = (i1 , . . . , in−1 ), that is
µ(σ, I) := µ(I ′ , win (σ)),
see [14, eq. 3.2.2]. It is clear that the selection of wi (σ) describes completely the
action of Gal(Q̄/Q) on Fs−1 .
3.3.1. The commutative Magnus ring. In this article we will consider actions of
Aut(Fs−1 ) or Aut(Fs−1 ) on certain Z-modules (Zℓ -modules) M defined as quotients
ab
of subgroups of the (pro-ℓ) free group. For example on Fs−1
or on Fab
s−1 . We would
like for M to be an abelian group (we also choose to write M additively) and we
will entirely focus on the case M = R/R′ , where R < Fs−1 (or R < Fs−1 ).
The group Fs−1 (resp. Fs−1 ) acts on itself by conjugation. This action can be
translated as an T (H) (resp. T̂ (H)) module structure on M , by setting
αwα−1 = Θ(α) · w,
for w ∈ Fs−1 (resp. w ∈ Fs−1 ).

Lemma 25. If M = R/R′ and [R, F′s−1 ] ⊂ R′ (resp. [R, Fs−1
] ⊂ R′ ) then the
induced conjugation action on M satisfies

(24)

ab · m = ba · m, for all a, b ∈ T̂ (H)(resp. T (H)) and m ∈ M.

′
Notice that the inclusion F′s−1 ⊂ R (resp. Fs−1
⊂ R) implies the desired condition
for the action to commute.

Proof. For a, b ∈ Fs−1 and r ∈ R we compute
abrb−1 a−1 = ba[a−1 , b−1 ]r[a−1 , b−1 ]−1 a−1 b−1 .
′
So a sufficient condition for eq. (24) to hold is [R, F′s−1 ] ⊂ R′ (resp. [R, Fs−1
] ⊂ R′ ).
This condition is satisfied if F′s−1 ⊂ R (resp. Fs−1 ⊂ R) then eq. (24) holds.


Therefore, if the assumption of lemma 25 holds, instead of considering the action
of the non-commutative ring T̂ (H) (resp. T (H)) it makes sense to consider the
action of the corresponding abelianized ring.
Definition 26. Consider the commutative Zℓ -algebra of formal power series
A
(25)

=
∼
=

Zℓ [[ui : 1 ≤ i ≤ s]]/ h(1 + u1 )(1 + u2 ) · · · (1 + us ) − 1i
Zℓ [[ui : 1 ≤ i ≤ s − 1]].

The algebra A is the symmetric algebra of H over Zℓ , and there is a natural quotient
map T̂ (H) → Sym(H) = A .
Remark 27. As we noticed already the action of σ ∈ Gal(Q̄/Q) can be described
in terms of the cocycles w1 (σ), . . . , ws−1 (σ). But then we can find elements
̟1 (σ) = Θ(w1 (σ)), . . . , ̟s−1 (σ) = Θ(ws−1 (σ)) ∈ A
such that
(26)

χ (σ)

σ(xi ) = ̟i (σ) · xi ℓ

.

Therefore, in order to understand the action of Gal(Q̄/Q) on M = Fs−1 /F′s−1 it
makes sense to consider the A -module structure of M .
4. Alexander modules
4.1. Definition and Crowell exact sequence. We will use the notation of section 1.1 for the groups R̄0 , R = R̄0 /Γ ∩ R̄0 ∼

sequence in eq. (10). The group G = Fs−1 /Γ admits the presentation:
(27)

V

G = hx1 , . . . , xs |xe11 = · · · = xess = x1 · · · xs = 1i .

On the other hand since we assumed that F′s−1 ⊂ R̄0 , (see lemma 25) the group
Fs−1 /R̄0 · Γ is isomorphic to a quotient of the abelian group Z/e1 Z × · · · × Z/es−1 Z.
Recall that ψ : Fs−1 /Γ → Fs−1 /R̄0 · Γ. Set
A R̄0 ,Γ = Zℓ [[Fs−1 /R̄0 · Γ]],
and define the map εA R̄0 ,Γ : Zℓ [[Fs−1 /R̄0 · Γ]] → Zℓ to be the augmentation map
corresponding functorially to the map Fs−1 /R̄0 · Γ → {1Fs−1 /R̄0 ·Γ }, see [20, 8.3

For a description of the Alexander module in terms of differentials in non-commutative
algebras we refer to [16]. Notice that when the group Fs−1 /R̄0 · Γ is finite then we
will write Zℓ [Fs−1 /R̄0 · Γ] instead of ZP
ℓ [[Fs−1 /R̄0 · Γ]]. In this
P case εA R̄0 ,Γ is the
augmentation map sending finite sums g∈Fs−1 /R̄0 ·Γ ag g to g∈Fs−1 /R̄0 ·Γ ag ∈ Zℓ .

In what follows F′s−1 = R̄0 in the context of eq. (10). The structure of F′s−1 /F′′s−1

βs+1 (1, x̄1 , . . . , x̄1 · · · x̄s−1 ) = (Σ1 β1 , . . . , Σs βs )

rankZℓ Q = s(ℓk )s−2 + (ℓk )s−1 − 1.
We would like to compute the cokernel of Q as a Zℓ [H0 ]-module. This computation lies within the theory of integral representation theory. This seems a very
difficult problem since a complete set of representatives of the classes of indecomposable modules for groups of the form (Z/ℓk Z)t seems to be known only for t = 1
and k = 1, 2, see [22]. In this article we will not consider the problem in the integral representation setting and instead we will consider the simpler problem of
determination of the H0 -action on the space H1 (Ck,s−1 , F), where F is a field which
contains Zℓ and the ℓk -roots of unity. Let us fix a primitive ℓk root of unity ζℓk .
Set
I := (Z ∩ [0, ℓk ))s−1 .
If i ∈ I , set is := i1 + · · · + is−1 . Now define
(36)

z(i) := #{j : 1 ≤ j ≤ s and ij ≡ 0

Lemma 33. We have the following decomposition

Im(Q) ⊗ F =

where ci ∈ N is the multiplicity of the corresponding character.
Proof. Consider the decomposition given in lemma 32. The module F[H0 ] contains

O
F[H0 ] =
Fχi

On the other hand the modules Σi F[H0 ] for 0 ≤ i ≤ s − 1 are trivially acted on by
elements x̄i . This means that
M
Σi F[H0 ] =

i∈I
i=(ν1 ,...,νi−1 ,0,νi+1 ,...,νs−1 )

Also the module Σs F[H0 ] contains elements which are invariant by elements of
−1
the group generated by x̄1 · · · x̄s−1 , since x̄s = x̄−1
1 · · · x̄s−1 . This means that all

= s(ℓk )s−1 − s(ℓk )s−2 − (ℓk )s−1 + 1 = (s − 1)(ℓk )s−1 − s(ℓk )s−2 + 1.

Similarly the decomposition in eq. (39) follows by the decomposition of F[H0 ] into
characters.

rank Rℓk /(Rk ∩ Rℓk )

The above abelianization corresponds to the Zℓ -homology of the generalized Fermat
curves of type (k, s − 1). The above rank coincides with the genus computation
given in eq. (19).

Let us write
H1 (Cℓk ,s−1 , F) =

M

FC(i)χi

i∈I

for some integers C(i). By lemma 34 and the short exact sequence given in (29) we
obtain eq. (40).

Remark 36. For the case of classical Fermat curves we have s = 3. The character
χ0,0,0 has z(0, 0, 0) = 3 and C0,0,0 = 0. Similarly the characters χ0,i,i , χi,0,i for
1 ≤ i ≤ ℓk − 1 and the character χi,j,i+j with i + j ≡ 0 mod ℓk have z(0, i, i) =
z(i, 0, i) = z(i, j, i + j) = 1 so their contribution is C(0, i, i) = C(i, 0, i) = C(i, j, i +
j) = 0. All other characters χ(i,j,i+j) have z(i, j, i + j) = 0 and their contribution
is C(i, j, i + j) = 1. In this way we arrive to the same result as in eq. (2).
R

Example 37. Let us now compute Aψ ℓk
of the group generated by

,Rk

and Rℓk is the the pro-ℓ completion
k

{xi1 xj x−i−1
: 2 ≤ j ≤ s − 1, 0 ≤ i ≤ ℓk − 2} ∪ {xℓ1
1

−1

xj : 1 ≤ j ≤ s − 1}.

This group corresponds to the open cyclic cover of order ℓk of P1 ramified fully
above s-points of the projective line, see [15, lemma 11]. Let Rk = Γ be the
k
k
smallest closed normal subgroup of Fs−1 generated by xℓ1 , . . . , xℓs−1 . We have the
short exact sequence
1 → Rℓk /Rℓk ∩ Rk → Fs−1 /Rk → Z/ℓk Z → 0.
We compute A Rℓk ,Rk = Zℓ [Z/ℓk Z], which is an Zℓ -module of rank ℓk . On the other
R ,R
hand observe that the Zℓ -module Aψ ℓk k is given by exactly the same cokernel as
F′

′

the module A Fs−1 ,Rk . The only difference is that Aψ s−1
module while A Rℓk ,Rk is a Zℓ [Z/ℓk Z]-module.

,Rk

is a Zℓ [(Z/ℓk Z)s−1 ]-

So following exactly the same method as in example 30 we conclude that
Rℓk ,Rk

rankZℓ Aψ

= s · ℓk − s − ℓk + 1 = (s − 1)ℓk − s + 1.

Also we compute the rank
ab
R ,R

rank Rℓk /(Rℓk ∩ Rk )

ab
corresponds to the Zℓ -homology of the above curves,
The module Rℓk /Rℓk ∩Rk
corresponding to Rℓk and its rank is twice the genus of the curve, in accordance
with the genus formula given in [15, eq. 21].
5. Galois modules in terms of the Magnus embedding
5.1. The group F′s−1 /F′′s−1 as an A -module. In this section we will study the
A -module structure of F′s−1 /F′′s−1 . This is the arithmetic analogon of the Gassner
representation, as Ihara points out in [12]. This consideration leads to the Galois
representation of the Tate module, see section 5.1.4. Finally in section 5.1.5 we
will study the passage from the Gassner representation to the Burau by seeing the
generalized Fermat curve as a cover of the projective line.

5.1.1. Application to Generalized Fermat curves. Consider the the smallest closed

Set λ̄ = {0, 1, ∞, λ1 , . . . , λs−3 } and let M be the maximum pro-ℓ extension of

Let Kkur and Kkunrab be the maximal unramified and maximal abelian unramified
extensions of Kk respectively. Also let K ′ be the maximum abelian unramified
extension of K and K ′′ be the maximum abelian unramified extension of K ′ . By
covering space theory, the fields K ′ , K ′′ correspond to the groups F′s−1 and F′′s−1 ,
respectively. The function field Kk corresponds to the group F′s−1 Rk and is equal
to the function field of the generalized Fermat curve.

The aim of this section is the following characterization of the maximal unramified abelian extension Kkunrab of the function field Kk of the generalized Fermat
curve. This is a generalisation of a similar construction by Ihara for the classical
Fermat curves, see [11, sec. II, p. 63]
Theorem 38. We have that Gal(Kkunrab /Kk ) ∼

The last genus computation also follows from the following proposition which identifies unramified Z/ℓk Z-extensions of a curve X with the group of ℓk -torsion points
of the Jacobian J(X).
Proposition 39. Let Y be a complete nonsingular algebraic curve defined over a
field of characteristic prime to ℓ. The étale Galois covers of Y with Galois group
1
Z/ℓk Z are classified by the étale cohomology group Het
(Y, Z/ℓk Z) which is equal to
the group of ℓk -torsion points of Pic(Y ).
Proof. See [9, Ex. 2.7], [23, sec. 19].

5.1.2. Crowell sequence for generalized Fermat curves. We will use the notation of
section 4 where R̄0 = F′s−1 and Γ = Rk , R = F′s−1 /(Rk ∩ Fs−1 ) ∼

Notice also that the commutator identity for quotients imply that F′s−1,k = F′s−1 ·
Rk /Rk = R. Here we use the presentation Fs−1 ∼

(Z/ℓk Z)s−1 . We have the short exact sequence

The later element is in Rk since by definition Rk is normal in Fs−1 . The limit
an → N (σ) is in Rk since this group is by definition closed. The result follows. 
′

It is clear that A Fs−1 ,Rk = Zℓ [H0 ] can be considered through the vertical map ω
′
as an A -module and inherits an action of Gal(Q̄/Q) by ω, by writing α ∈ A Fs−1 ,Rk
as the image of an element α′ ∈ A , that is α = ω(α′ ) and defining
σ(α) = σ(ω(α′ )) = ω(σα′ ).
By lemma 40 this action is well defined. On the other hand an element φ = [xi , xj ] ∈
F′s−1,k /F′′s−1,k = F′s−1 /(F′s−1 ∩ Fs−1′′ Rk ) is sent to the element
F′

F′s−1 ,Rk

′

The module Aψ
is an A Fs−1 ,Rk -module, described by the sequence given
in eq. (30) and by the matrix Q given in eq. (34) and is naturally acted on
by the absolute Galois group. Observe also that the map θ sends the class of
[xi , xj ] to d[xi , xj ] = ui dxj − uj dxi , and this element is annihilated by the elements
Pℓk −1 ν
Σi =
ν=0 x̄i for 1 ≤ i ≤ s. We can see this by direct computations or by
F′

observing that in Aψ s−1

,Rk

we have

Σi · βi = βs+1 x̄1 · · · x̄i−1 .
and the image θ[xi , xj ] has the s + 1 coordinate βs+1 = 0. The above observation
generalises the definition of ideal an in eq. (8) in the article of Ihara, [11].
Therefore,
F′

H1 (Cℓk ,s−1 , Zℓ ) ∼
= θ((F′s−1,k )ab ) ⊂ Aψ s−1

,Rk

′

is acted on by A Fs−1 ,Rk /hΣi : 1 ≤ i ≤ si, and Gal(Q̄/Q) acts on it in terms of the
F
,R
action given in eq. (26). Indeed, Aψ s−1 k is identified with the cokernel of the
F

matrix Q, i.e. an element in Aψ s−1

,Rk

is the class of an s-tuple which is sent to

σ : (β1 , . . . , βs ) + Im(Q) 7−→ (σβ1 , . . . , σβs ) + Im(Q).
This action is well defined since the space Im(Q) is left invariant under the action
N (σ)
of Gal(Q̄/Q). Indeed, in the commutative ring A Fs−1 ,Rk , the action σ(x̄i ) = x̄i
so σ(Σi ) = Σi , and invariance follows by eq. (35).
5.1.4. On Jacobian variety of Generalized Fermat curves. Consider the ℓ-adic Tate
module T (Jac(Cℓk ,s−1 )) of the Jacobian of the generalized Fermat curves Cℓk ,s−1 :

where the inverse limit is considered with respect to the maps T (Jac(Cℓk+1 ,s−1 )) →

(x0 , . . . , xs−1 ) 7→ (xℓ0 , . . . , xℓs−1 ).
Let C̄ℓk ,s−1 = Cℓk ,s−1 ⊗SpecQ SpecQ̄. Consider also the inverse limit

F′s−1 ∼

F′′s−1

(49)

See [1, sec. 13] for the explicit isomorphism in the case of Fermat curves.
The geometric interpretation of this construction is that for fixed s-number of
points we can consider all generalized Fermat curves seen as (Z/ℓk Z)s ramified
covers of the projective line, for k ∈ N. In this way we obtain a curve Cs , which is
a Zℓs−1 cover of the projective line. The Burau representation and the pro-ℓ Burau
representation can be defined in terms of such an infinite Galois cover, see [15].
This construction leads to the definition of a subspace Tprim ⊂ T which is a
free A -module of rank s − 2. Observe that the submodule of a free module is not
necessarily a free module and F′s−1 /F′′s−1 is not necessarily free. For example in the
following short exact sequence
0

/ (F′s−1 )ab = F′s−1 /F′′s−1

/ A s−1 d1 / A

/ Zℓ

/0

F′s−1 /F′′s−1 is contained in the free A -module A s−1 , but is free itself. The A module F′s−1 /F′′s−1 contains the free module of rank s − 2 (see [21],[14, Th. 5.39])

In the case of Fermat curves, i.e. s = 2 we have that (F′s−1 /F′′s−1 )prim = F′s−1 /F′′s−1
and F′s−1 /F′′s−1 is a free A -module, generated by [x1 , x2 ]. Notice that the injective
d

map d : F′s−1 /F′′s−1 −→ A s−1 is given by sending a representative
[xi , xj ] → d([xi , xj ]) = (1 − xj )dxi − (1 − xi )dxj
= −uj · dxi + ui · dxj .
Proposition 41. Let G be either Gal(Q̄/Q) or the braid group Bs . An element in
g ∈ G induces an action on both T and Tprim . In particular the subspace Tprim is
a free A -module. Thus we have a cocycle map
ρ : Gal(Q̄/Q) → GLs−2 (A )

This cocycle can be given in terms of the matrix

Remark 42. In [14, sec. 5.3] this cocycle is identified as the Gassner representation
and the relation with the classical definition in terms of Fox derivatives see [3,
chap. 3] is studied. The Gassner cocycles when restricted to a certain subgroup
Gal(Q̄/Q)[1] ⊂ Gal(Q̄/Q) give rise to a representation instead of cocycle, see [14].
5.1.5. From generalized Fermat curves to cyclic covers of P1 . We will now relate
the Crowell sequences for the generalized Fermat curves and cyclic covers Ȳℓk of
the projective line as they were defined in [15] using the results of [16]. This will
provide the relation of the Gassner representation to the Burau representation. The
analogon of the Burau representation was defined in [14, p.675] by reduction of the
Gassner representation. Here we also consider this reduction with respect to the
curve definition of the Burau representation.

The passage for the corresponding representations from Cℓk ,s−1 to Ȳℓk corresponds
to the passage from the Gassner representation to the Burau representation, see [3,
prop. 3.12] and [14, sec. 5].
Set R̄ℓk be the fundamental group of the closed curve Ȳℓk , which can be computed

The map φ1 : T → TR on Tate modules is given by the first vertical map. The
action module structure is given by the commutating diagram
/T
A ×T

where the horizontal maps are the module actions and the first vertical map sends
(a, t) 7→ (φ3 (a), φ1 (t)). The map φ3 is the reduction identifying the variables
x1 , x2 , . . . , xs−1 . Let G be as in proposition 41. The map φ2 is defined in a similar
way as in eq. (47). In particular from the reduction T → TR we obtain the diagram
/ GLs−2 (A )
