LORENTZIAN GEODESIC FLOWS AND INTERPOLATION
BETWEEN HYPERSURFACES IN EUCLIDEAN SPACES
JAMES DAMON
Abstract. We consider geodesic flows between hypersurfaces in Rn . However, rather than consider using geodesics in Rn , which are straight lines,
we consider an induced flow using geodesics between the tangent spaces of
the hypersurfaces viewed as affine hyperplanes. For naturality, we want the
geodesic flow to be invariant under rigid transformations and homotheties.
Consequently, we do not use the dual projective space, as the geodesic flow in
this space is not preserved under translations. Instead we give an alternate
approach using a Lorentzian space, which is semi-Riemannian with a metric
of index 1.
For this space for points corresponding to affine hyperplanes in Rn , we give
a formula for the geodesic between two such points. As a consequence, we
show the geodesic flow is preserved by rigid transformations and homotheties
of Rn . Furthermore, we give a criterion that a vector field in a smoothly
varying family of hyperplanes along a curve yields a Lorentzian parallel vector
field for the corresponding curve in the Lorentzian space. As a result this
provides a method to extend an orthogonal frame in one affine hyperplane
to a smoothly “Lorentzian varying”family of orthogonal frames in a family of
affine hyperplanes along a smooth curve, as well as a interpolating between two
such frames with a smooth “minimally Lorentzian varying”family of orthogonal
frames.
We further give sufficient conditions that the Lorentzian flow from a hypersurface is nonsingular and that the resulting corresponding flow in Rn is
nonsingular. This is illustrated for surfaces in R3 .

Introduction
We consider the problem of constructing a natural diffeomorphic flow between
hypersurfaces M0 and M1 of Rn which is in some sense both “natural”and “geodesic”viewed in some appropriate space (as in figure ).
There are several approaches to this question. One is from the perspective
of a Riemannian metric on the group of diffeomorphisms of Rn . If the smooth
hypersurfaces Mi bound compact regions Ωi , then the group of diffeomorphisms
Diff (Rn ) acts on such regions Ωi and their boundaries. Then, if ϕt , 1 ≤ t ≤ 1, is a
geodesic in Diff (Rn ) beginning at the identity, then ϕt (Ω) (or ϕt (Mi )) provides a

Figure 1. Diffeomorphic Flow between hypersurfaces of Euclidean space induced by a “Geodesic Flow”in an associated space
path interpolating between Ω0 = ϕ0 (Ω) = Ω and Ω1 = ϕ1 (Ω). Then, the geodesic
equations can be computed and numerically solved to construct the flow ϕt . This is
the method developed by Younes, Trouve, Glaunes [Tr], [YTG], [BMTY], [YTG2],
and Mumford, Michor [MM], [MM2] etc.
An alternate approach which we consider in this paper requires that we are given
a correspondence between M0 and M1 , defined by a diffeomorphism χ : M0 → M1 ,
which need not be the restriction of a global diffeomorphism of Rn (and the Mi
may have boundaries). Then, if we map M0 and M1 to submanifolds of a natural
ambient space Λ, we can seek a “geodesic flow”between M0 and M1 , viewed as
submanifolds of Λ, sending x to ϕ(x) along a geodesic. Then, we use this geodesic
flow to define a flow between M0 and M1 back in Rn .
The simplest example of this is the “radial flow”from M0 using the vector field U
on M0 defined by U (x) = ϕ(x) − x. Then, the radial flow is the geodesic flow in Rn
defined by ϕt (x) = x + t · U (x). The analysis of the nonsingularity of the radial flow
is given in [D1] in the more general context of “skeletal structures”. This includes
the case where M1 is a “generalized offset surface”of M0 via the generalized offset
vector field U .
In this paper, we give an alternate approach to interpolation via a geodesic flow
between hypersurfaces with a given correspondence. While the radial flow views
each hypersurface as a collection of points, we will instead view each as defined
by their collection of tangent spaces. This leads to consideration of geodesic flows
between “dual varieties”. The dual varieties traditionally lie in the “dual projective
space”. However, the geodesic flow induced on the dual projective space with
its natural Riemannian metric does not have certain natural properties that are
desirable, such as invariance under translation. Instead, we shall define in §3 a
‘Lorentzian map”to a hypersurface T n in the Lorentzian space Λn+1 defined by
their tangent spaces as affine hyperplanes in Rn+1 . So instead of representing
hypersurfaces in terms of “dual varieties”, we instead represent them as subspaces
of Λn+1 , which is the subspace of points in Minkowski space Rn+2,1 of Lorentzian
norm 1. Then, we use the geodesic flow for the Lorentzian metric on Λn+1 , and
then transform that geodesic flow back to a flow between the original manifolds in
Rn .
To do this we determine in §4 the explicit form for the Lorentzian geodesics in
Λn+1 between points in T n . We show these geodesics lie in T n and show in §5
that these geodesics are invariant under the extended Poincare group. Given a

Figure 2. a) Hypersurface M0 and radial vector field U define
a generalized offset surface M1 obtained from a radial flow of the
skeletal structure (M0 , U ). This gives a nonsingular “Geodesic
Flow”in Rn . In b) there is no nonsingular geodesic flow in Rn from
M0 to M1 ; however, there is a nonsingular Lorentzian geodesic flow
from M0 to M1 (see §9)
Lorentzian geodesic between two points in T n , there corresponds a smooth family
of hyperplanes Πt .
We further give in §6 a criterion for “Lorentzian parallel vector fields” in a family
of hyperplanes Πt along a curve γ(t) in Rn , and then determine the Lorentzian
parallel vector fields over a Lorentzian geodesic corresponding to vector fields with
values in Πt . Using this, we determine for an orthonormal frame {ei,0 } in Π0 , a
smooth family of orthonormal frames {ei,t } in Πt which correspond to a Lorentzian
parallel family of frames along the Lorentzian geodesic. Using this we further
determine a method for interpolating between orthonormal frames {ei,0 } in Π0 and
{ei,1 } in Π1 .
In §§7 and 8 we relate the properties of hypersurfaces M̃ of T n with corresponding properties of the envelopes formed from the planes defined by M̃ . In §7 we give
a diffeomorphism between the Lorentzian space T n with the dual projective space
RP n ∨ , which is a Riemannian manifold. The classification of generic Legendrian
singularities in RP n ∨ gives the form of the singular points of images and this is
used to give criteria for the lifting to a hypersurface in Rn+1 as the envelope of the
family of corresponding hyperplanes.
Finally, in section 9 we give in Theorem 9.2 the existence and continuous dependence of the corresponding “Lorentzian geodesic flow” between two hypersurfaces
M0 and M1 in Rn+1 and in Theorem 9.3 we give a sufficient condition for the flow
to be nonsingular. As a special case we consider in §10 the results for surfaces in
R3 .

1. Overview
As mentioned in the introduction there are two main methods for deforming
one given hypersurface M0 ⊂ Rn to another M1 . One is to find a path ψt in G,
which is some specified a group of diffeomorphisms of Rn , from the identity so that
ψ1 (M0 ) = M1 (and ψ0 (M0 ) = M0 ).
Another approach involves constructing a geometric flow between M0 and M1 .
Several flows such as curvature flows do not provide a flow to a specific hypersurface
such as M1 . An alternate approach which we shall use will assume that we have a
correspondence given by a diffeomorphism χ : M0 → M1 and construct a “geodesic
flow”which at time t = 1 gives χ. The geodesic flow will be defined using an
associated space Y. We shall consider natural maps ϕi : Mi → Y , where Y is a
distinguished space which reflects certain geometric properties of the Mi .

Definition 1.1. Given smooth maps ϕi : Mi → Y and a diffeomorphism χ : M0 →
M1 A geodesic flow between the maps ϕi is a smooth map ψ̃t : M0 × [0, 1] → Y
such that for any x ∈ M0 , ψ̃t (x) : [0, 1] → Y is a geodesic from ϕ0 (x) to ϕ1 ◦ χ(x)
Remark . We shall also refer to the geodesic flow as being between the M̃i =
ϕi (Mi ). However, we note that it is possible for more than one xi ∈ M0 to map
to the same point in y ∈ Y, however, the geodesic flow from y can differ for each
point xi .
Then, we will complement this with a method for finding the corresponding flow
ψt between M0 and M1 such that ϕt ◦ ψt = ψ̃t , where ϕt : ψt (M0 ) → ψ̃t (M0 ).
We furthermore want this flow to satisfy certain properties. A main property is
that the flow construction is invariant under the action of the extended Poincare
group formed from rigid transformations and homotheties (scalar multiplication).
By this we mean: if M0′ = A(M0 ) and M1′ = A(M1 ) are transforms of M0 and
M1 by a transformation A formed from the composition of a rigid transformation
and homothety, and Mt is the flow between M0 and M1 , then A(Mt ) gives the flow
between M0′ and M1′ .
We are specifically interested in a “geodesic flow”which will be a flow defined
using the tangent bundles T M0 to T M1 so that we specifically control the flow of
the tangent spaces. At first, an apparent natural choice is the dual projective space
RP n∨ . Via the tangent bundle of a hypersurface M ⊂ Rn (⊂ RP n ) there is the
natural map δ : M → RP n∨ , sending x 7→ Tx M . The natural Riemannian structure
on the real projective space RP n∨ is induced from S n via the natural covering
map S n → RP n , so that geodesics of S n map to geodesics on RP n∨ . However,
simple examples show that the induced geodesic slow on RP n∨ is not invariant
under translation in Rn . For example, this Riemannian geodesic flow between the
hyperplanes given by n · x = c0 and n · x = c1 is given by n · x = ct , where
ct = tan(t arctan(c1 ) + (1 − t) arctan(c0 )). It is easily seen that if we translate the
two planes by adding a fixed amount d to each ci , then the corresponding formula
does not give the translation of the first.

We will use an alternate space for Y, namely, the Lorentzian space Λn+1 which is
a Lorentzian subspace of Minkowski space Rn+2,1 . In fact the images will be in an
n-dimensional submanifold T n ⊂ Λn+1 . On Λn+1 it is classical that the geodesics
are intersections with planes through the origin in Rn+2,1 . This allows a simple
description of the geodesic flow on Λn+1 . We transfer this flow to a flow on Rn
using an inverse envelope construction, which reduces to solving systems of linear
equations. We will give conditions for the smoothness of the inverse construction
which uses knowledge of the generic Legendrian singularities.
We shall furthermore see that the construction is invariant under the action
of rigid transformations and homotheties. In addition, uniform translations and
homotheties will be geodesic flows, and a “pseudo rotation”which is a variant of
uniform rotation is also a geodesic flow.
2. Semi-Riemannian Manifolds and Lorentzian Manifolds
A Semi-Riemannian manifold M is a smooth manifold M , with a nondegenerate
bilinear form < ·, · >x on the tangent space Tx M , for eaxh x ∈ M which smoothly
varies with x. We do not require that < ·, · >x be positive definite. We denote the
index of < ·, · >(x) by ν. In the case that ν = 1, M is referred to as a Lorentzian
manifold.
A basic example is Minkowski space which (for our purposes) is Rn+2 with
bilinear form defined for v = (v1 , . . . , vn+2 ) and w = (w1 , . . . , vn+2 )

There are a number of different notations for this Minkowski space. We shall use
Rn+2,1 . We shall also use the notation < ·, · >L for the Lorentzian inner product
on Rn+2,1 .
A submanifold N of a semi-Riemannian manifold M is a semi-Riemannian submanifold if for each x ∈ N , the restriction of < ·, · >(x) to Tx N is nondegenerate.
There are several important submanifolds of Rn+2,1 . One such is the Lorentzian

By contrast the restriction of < ·, · >L to Hn+1 is a Riemannian metric of constant negative curvature −1. There is natural duality between codimension 1 submanifolds of Hn+1 obtained as the intersection of Hn+1 with a “time-like”hyperplane
Π through 0 (containing a “time-like”vector z with < z, z >L < 0) paired with the
points ±z ′ ∈ Λn+1 given where z ′ lies on a line through the origin which is the
Lorentzian orthogonal complement to Π.
Many of the results which hold for Riemannian manifolds also hold for a SemiRiemannian manifold M .

2.1 (Basic properties of Semi-Riemannian Manifolds (see [ON]).
For a Semi-Riemannian manifold M , there are the following properties analogous
to those for Riemannian manifolds:
(1) Smooth Curves on M have lengths defined using | < ·, · > |.
(2) There is a unique connection which satisfies the usual properties of a Riemannian Levi-Civita connection.
(3) Geodesics are defined locally from any point x ∈ M and with any initial
velocity v ∈ Tx M . They are critical curves for the length functional, and
they have constant speed.
(4) If N is a semi-Riemannian submanifold of M , then a constant speed curve
γ(t) in N is a geodesic in N if the acceleration γ ′′ (t) is normal to N (with
respect to the semi-Riemannian metric) at all points of γ(t).
(5) Any point x ∈ M has a “convex neighborhood” W , which has the property
that any two points in W are joined by a unique geodesic in the neighborhood.
(6) If γ(t) is a geodesic joining x0 = γ(0) and x1 = γ(1) and x0 and x1 are
not conjugate along γ(t), then given a neighborhood W of γ(t), there are
neighborhoods of W0 of x0 and W1 of x1 so that if x′0 ∈ W0 , and x′1 ∈ W1 ,
there is a unique geodesic in the neighborhood W from x′0 to x′1 .
Then, as an example, it is straightforward to verify that for any z ∈ Λn+1 , the
vector z is orthogonal to Λn+1 at the point z. Suppose P is a plane in Rn+2,1
containing the origin. Let γ(t) be a constant Lorentzian speed parametrization of
the curve obtained by intersecting P with Λn+1 . Then, by a standard argument
similar to that for the case of a Euclidean sphere, γ(t) is a geodesic. All geodesics of
Λn+1 are obtained in this way. It follows that the submanifolds of Λn+1 obtained
by intersecting Λn+1 with a linear subspace is a totally geodesic submanifold of
Λn+1 .

3. Definition of the Lorentzian Map
We begin by giving a geometric definition of a Lorentzian map from a smooth
hypersurface M ∈ Rn , as a natural map from M to Λn+1 ; and then giving that
geometric definition an algebraic form.
3.1. Geometric Definition of the Lorentzian Map. First, we let S n denote the
unit sphere in Rn+1 centered at the origin, and we let en+1 = (0, . . . , 0, 1) ∈ Rn+1 .
Then, stereographic projection defines a map p : S n \{en+1 } → Rn sending y to
the point where the line from en+1 to y intersects Rn . Given a hyperplane Π
in Rn , it together with en+1 spans a hyperplane Π′ in Rn+1 . We can identify
Rn+1 with Rn+1 × {en+2 } ⊂ Rn+2,1 by translation in the direction en+2 . The
intersection of this plane with S n+1 is an n-sphere. Then, via this identification of
Rn+1 with the hyperplane in Rn+2,1 defined by xn+2 = 1, we form the hyperplane
Π′′ in Rn+2,1 spanned by Π′ together with 0. This hyperplane is time-like because
Π′′ intersects Rn+1 × {en+2 } in a hyperplane Π′ which intersects the unit sphere
in Rn+1 × {en+2 } in a sphere, hence it intersects the interior disk. Then, the
duality defined by the Lorentzian inner product associates to the hyperplane Π′′
the Lorentzian orthogonal line ℓ through the origin. As the hyperplane is time-like,
ℓ has non-empty intersection with Λn+1 in a pair of points z and −z.
In order to obtain a single valued map, there are two possibilities: Either we
consider the induce map to Λ̃n+1 = Λn+1 / ∼, where ∼ identifies each pair of points
z and −z of Λn+1 ; or we need on Π a unit vector field n orienting Π. Given the
normal vector n, it defines a distinguished side of Π. Then we obtain a distinguished
side for Π′ and then Π′′ , which singles out one of the two points in Λn+1 on the
distinguished side. We shall refer to this second case as the oriented case. We shall
use both versions of the maps.
The geometric definition is then as follows.
Definition 3.1. Given a smooth hypersurface M ∈ Rn , with a smooth normal
vector field n on M , the (oriented) Lorentz map is the natural map L : M → Λn+1
defined by L(x) = z, where to Π = Tx M is associated the plane Π′′ , Lorentzian
orthogonal line ℓ, and the distinguished intersection z with Λn+1 .
In the general case where we do not have an orientation for M , we define L̃ :
M → Λ̃n+1 by L̃(x) is the equivalence class of ±z in Λ̃n+1 .
In fact, from the algebraic form of this map to follow, we shall see that it actually
maps into an n dimensional submanifold T n of Λn+1 . We give a specific algebraic
form for this map.
3.2. Algebraic (Coordinate) Definition of the Lorentzian Map. We can
give a coordinate definitions for the maps. If Tx M is defined by n · x = c, where
x = (x1 , . . . , xn ). Then, Π′ contains Tx M and en+1 and so is defined by n · x +
cxn+1 = c. Then, Π′′ contains Π′ × {en+2 } and the origin so it is defined by
n · x + cxn+1 − cxn+2 = 0. Thus, the Lorentzian orthogonal line ℓ is spanned by
(n, c, c), which we write in abbreviated form as (n, cǫ) with ǫ = (1, 1). Hence,
the map L : M → Λn+1 sends x to (n, cǫ), and the general case sends it to
the equivalence class in T̃ n determined by (n, cǫ). We shall be concerned with
a subspace of Λn+1 where this duality corresponds to hypersurfaces of Rn . The
general correspondence is used in [OH] to parametrize (n − 1)-dimensional spheres
in Rn .

LORENTZIAN GEODESIC FLOWS

We need on M a smooth normal unit vector field n orienting M . Given the
normal vector field n, it defines a distinguished side of Tx M .
In fact, the image lies in the submanifold T n of Λn+1 defined by
Tn

=

{(n, cǫ) : n ∈ S n−1 , c ∈ R}

which we can view as a submanifold T n ⊂ Λn+1 ; or in the general case it lies in
T̃ n .
Definition 3.2. Given a smooth hypersurface M ∈ Rn , with a smooth normal
vector field n on M , the (oriented) Lorentz map is the natural map L : M → T n
defined by L(x) = (n, cǫ), where Tx M is defined by n·x = c. In the general case, we
choose a local normal vector field and then L̃(x) is the equivalence class of (n, cǫ)
in T̃ n .
In the following we shall generally concentrate on the oriented case and the map
L, with the general case just involving considering the map to equivalence classes.
Using L or L̃, we are led to considering the geodesic flow in Λn+1 , and obtain
the induced geodesic flow on Λ̃n+1 . Once we have determined the geodesic flow
between points in T n , there are two questions concerning L to lift the flow back to
hypersurfaces in Rn . One is when L is nonsingular, and at singular points what can
we say about the local properties of L when M is generic. The second question is
how we may construct the inverse of L when it is a local embedding (or immersion).
4. Lorentzian Geodesic Flow on Λn+1
We give the general formula for the geodesic flow between points z0 = (n0 , d0 ǫ)
and z1 = (n1 , d1 ǫ) in T n .
Several Auxiliary Functions.
To do so we introduce several auxiliary functions. We first define the function
λ(x, θ) by

(4.1)

λ(x, θ)

=

(

sin(xθ)
sin(θ)

x

θ=
6 0
θ=0

Then, sin(z) is a holomorphic function of z, and the quotient sin(xθ)
sin(θ) has removable
singularities along θ = 0 with value x. Hence, λ(z, θ) is a holomorphic function
of (z, θ) on C × ((−π, π) × i R), and so analytic on R × (−π, π). Also, directly
computing the derivative we obtain
(
∂λ((x, θ)

Remark . In fact, we can recognize λ(n, θ) for integer values n as the characters
for the irreducible representations of SU (2) restricted to the maximal torus.
We also introduce a second function for later use in §5. For − π2 < θ <
define

Then, there is the following relation
θ
λ(x, θ) + λ(1 − x, θ) = µ(1 − 2x, )
2
This follows by using the basic trigonometric formulas sin(x) + sin(y) = 2 cos( 12 (x −
y)) sin( 12 (x + y)) and sin θ = 2 sin( 21 θ) cos( 21 θ). There are additional relations between these two functions that follow from other basic trigonometric identies.
(4.3)

Geodesic Curves in Λn+1 joining points in T n .
We may express the geodesic curve between z0 = (n0 , c0 ǫ) and z1 = (n1 , c1 ǫ)
in Λn+1 using λ(x, θ) provided n1 6= −n0 . We let − π2 < θ < π2 be defined by
cos θ = n0 · n1 .
Proposition 4.1. Provided n1 6= −n0 , the geodesic curve γ(t) in Λn+1 between
points γ(0) = z0 and γ(1) = z1 in T n for the Lorentzian metric on Λn+1 is given
by
(4.4)

γ(t)

=

λ(t, θ) z1 + λ(1 − t, θ) z0

for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1

Furthermore, this curve lies in T n for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1. Hence, T n is a geodesic submanifold of Λn+1 .
We can expand the expression for γ(t) and obtain the family of hyperplanes Πt
in Rn . Expanding (4.4) we obtain
(4.5)

λ(t, θ) n1 + λ(1 − t, θ) n0

λ(t, θ) c1 + λ(1 − t, θ) c0

and

Then the family Πt is given by
(4.6)

Πt

{x = (x1 , . . . , xn ) ∈ Rn : x · nt = ct }

We can also compute the initial velocity for the geodesic in (4.4).
Corollary 4.2. The initial velocity of the geodesic (4.4) with θ 6= 0 is given by
θ
· (projn0 (n1 ), (c1 − cos θ c0 )ǫ)
sin θ
where projn0 denotes projection along n0 onto the line spanned by w. If θ = 0,
then n0 = n1 and the velocity is (0, (c1 − c0 )ǫ) (with Lorentzian speed 0).

(4.7)

γ ′ (0)

=

Remark . Note that
k(projn0 (n1 ), (c1 − cos θ c0 )ǫ)kL = kprojn0 (n1 )k
which equals sin θ. We conclude that the Lorentzian magnitude of γ ′ (0) is θ. Since
geodesics have constant speed, the geodesic will travel a distance |θ|. Hence, |θ| is
the Lorentzian distance between z0 and z1 .
Proof of Proposition 4.1. Let P be the plane in Rn+1,1 which contains 0, z0 and z1 .
The geodesic curve between z0 and z1 is obtained as a constant Lorentzian speed
parametrization of the curve obtained by intersecting P with Λn+1 . We choose a
unit vector w ∈ Π such that n1 is in the plane through the origin spanned by n0
and w. Let 0 ≤ θ < π be the angle between n0 and n1 so cos θ = n0 · n1 . Then,
n1 − (n1 · n0 ) n0 is the projection of n1 along n0 onto the line spanned by w whose
direction is chosen so that n1 − cos θ n0 = sin θ w.

LORENTZIAN GEODESIC FLOWS

11

Then, a tangent vector to Λn+1 ∩ P at the point z0 is given by
(4.8)

(n1 − cos θ n0 , (c1 − cos θ c0 )ǫ) = (sin θ w, (c1 − cos θ c0 )ǫ)

Then, we seek a Lorentzian geodesic γ(t) in the plane P beginning at (n0 , c0 ǫ) with
initial velocity in the direction (sin θ w, (c1 − cos θ c0 )ǫ). Consider the curve
(4.9)

γ(t) = (cos(tθ)n0 + sin(tθ)w, (cos(tθ)c0 +

sin(tθ)
(c1 − cos θ c0 ))ǫ)
sin(θ)

First, note that γ(0) = z0 , and γ(1) = z1 . Also, this curve lies in the plane spanned
by z0 and (4.8). Also,
kγ(t)kL = k cos(tθ)n0 + sin(tθ)wk = 1
as n0 and w are orthogonal unit vectors. Hence, γ(t) is a curve parametrizing
Λn+1 ∩ P . It remains to show that γ ′′ is Lorentzian orthogonal to Λn+1 to establish
that it is a Lorentzian geodesic from z0 to z1 . A computation shows
γ ′′ (t) = −θ2 (cos(tθ)n0 + sin(tθ)w,

sin(tθ)
(c1 − cos θ c0 )ǫ)
sin(θ)

which is −θ2 γ(t), and hence Lorentzian orthogonal to Λn+1 .
Because of the fraction sin(tθ)
sin(θ) , we have to note that when θ = 0, then n0 = n1
and γ(t) takes the simplified form
γ(t) = (n0 , c0 + t(c1 − c0 ))ǫ)
which is still a Lorentzian geodesic between z0 to z1 .
Lastly, we must show that this agrees with (4.4). First, consider the case where
θ 6= 0.

w=
(n1 − cos θ n0 )

Substituting this into the first term of the RHS of (4.9), we obtain

which by the formula for the sine of the difference of two angles equals

Analogously, we can compute the second term in the RHS of (4.9), to be

This gives (4.4) when θ 6= 0. When θ = 0, n0 = n1 and the derivation of (4.4) from

Remark 4.3. We have alread seen that the geodesic flow between the planes
n0 · x = c0 and n1 · x = c1 induced from the geodesic flow in RP n∨ corresponds
to the geodesic flow between (n0 , c0 ) and (n1 , c1 ), which is given by the unit speed
curve in the intersection of the plane P , containing these points and the origin,
with the unit sphere S n . If we replaced (4.4) by linear interpolation
(4.10)

γ(t)

=

t (n1 , c1 ) + (1 − t) (n0 , c0 )

for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1

then the curve lies in the plane P and its projection onto the unit sphere does
parametrize the geodesic, but it is not unit speed, and as we remarked earlier it is
not invariant under translation and hence not under rigid transformations.
5. Invariance of Lorentzian Geodesic Flow and Special Cases
We investigate the invariance properties of Lorentzian geodesic flows and the
properties of these flows in special cases.
Invariance of Lorentzian Geodesic Flow. We first claim the Geodesic flow
given in Proposition 4.1 is invariant under the extended Poincare group generated
by rigid transformations and scalar multiplications. By this we mean the following.
If γ(t) = (nt , ct ) is the Lorentzian geodesic flow between hyperplanes P0 and P1
defined by n0 · x = c0 , respectively n1 · x = c1 , then ψ̃(γ(t)) is the Lorentzian
geodesic flow between hyperplanes ψ(P0 ) and ψ(P1 ).
Proposition 5.1. The Lorentzian geodesic flow is invariant under the extended
Poincare group.
Proof. Suppose zi = (ni , ci ) ∈ T n , i = 1, 2, and let Πi be the hyperplane determined
by zi . Let ψ be an alement of the extended Poincare group. It is a composition of
scalar multiplication by b followed by a rigid transformation so ψ(x) = b A(x) + p,
with A an orthogonal transformation. Then, Π′i = ψ(Πi ) is defined by
(5.1)

ψ̃(zi ) = ψ̃(ni , ci ) = (A(ni ), bci + ni · p).

If cos(θ) = n0 · n1 , then by (4.4) the Lorentzian geodesic flow is given by γ(t)
defined by
(5.2)

(nt , ct ) = (λ(t, θ)n1 + λ(1 − t, θ) n0 , λ(t, θ) c1 + λ(1 − t, θ) c0 )

defining the family of hyperplanes Πt . Then, by (5.1) Π′t = ψ(Πt ) is defined by
n′t · x = c′t , where ψ̃(γ(t)) is defined by
(5.3)
(n′t , c′t ) = (A(λ(t, θ)n1 + λ(1 − t, θ) n0 ), b(λ(t, θ))c1 + λ(1 − t, θ))c0 ) +
A(λ(t, θ)n1 + λ(1 − t, θ) · p))
= λ(t, θ) (A(n1 ), bc1 + A(n1 ) · p) + λ(1 − t, θ) (A(n0 ), bc0 + A(n0 ) · p)
= λ(1 − t, θ)ψ̃(z1 ) + λ(1 − t, θ)ψ̃(z0 )
which is the geodesic flow between Π′0 defined by ψ̃(z0 ) and Π′1 defined by ψ̃(z1 ).

Remark 5.2. An alternate way to understand Proposition 4.1 is to observe that
the extended Poincare group acts on Rn × Rǫ sending (v, cǫ) 7→ (A(v), (bc+ v ·w)ǫ).
This action preserves the Lorentzian inner product on this subspace and preserves
T n . Hence, it maps geodesics in T n to geodesics in T n .
Special Cases of Lorentzian Geodesic Flow. We next determine the form of
the Lorentzian geodesic flow in several special cases.
Example 5.3 (Hypersurfaces Obtained by a Translation and Homothety). Suppose
that we obtain Π1 from Π0 by translation by a vector p and multiplication by a
scalar b. The correspondence associates to x ∈ Π0 , bx′ = x + p ∈ Π1 . Then, the
geodesic flow is given by the following.

LORENTZIAN GEODESIC FLOWS

13

Corollary 5.4. Suppose Π0 is the hyperplane defined by n0 · x = c0 , with n0 a unit
vector, and Π1 is obtained from Π0 by multiplication by the scalar b 6= 0 and then
translation by p. Then the Lorentzian geodesic flow Πt is given by the family of
parallel hyperplanes defined by n0 · x = ct where ct = (1 + (b − 1)t)c0 + tn0 · p.
Proof. If Π0 is defined by n0 · x = c0 , with n0 a unit vector, then, Π1 is defined by
n1 · x = c1 where n1 = n0 and c1 = bc0 + n0 · p. Thus, Π1 is parallel to Π0 .
Thus, as n1 = n0 , θ = 0 and λ(t, 0) = t, so the geodesic flow Πt is given by
t(n0 , c1 ǫ) + (1 − t)(n0 , c0 ǫ) = (n0 , ((1 − t)c0 + t(bc0 + n0 · p))ǫ)
(5.4)

= (n0 , ((tb + 1 − t)c0 + t(n0 · p))ǫ)

so that Πt is defined by n0 · x = ct where ct = (1 + (b − 1)t)c0 + t(n0 · p).
This defines a family of hyperplanes parallel to Π0 where derivative of the translation map is the identity; hence, under translation n0 is mapped to itself translated
to x′ = x + p. Thus, under the correspondence, n1 = n0 . Also, If n0 · x = c0 is the
equation of the tangent plane for M0 at a point x, then the tangent plane of M1 at
the point x′ is
n1 · x′ = n0 · (x + p) = c0 + n0 · p
Hence, c1 = c0 + n0 · p.
As n0 = n1 , θ = 0. Thus the geodesic flow on T n is given by
t(n0 , c1 ǫ) + (1 − t)(n0 , c0 ǫ) = (n0 , c0 ǫ) + (0, (tn0 · p)ǫ) = (n0 , (n0 · (x + tp))ǫ)
Thus, at time t the tangent space is translated by tp. Thus, the envelope of these
translated hyperplanes is the translation of M0 by tp.

Remark 5.5. If a hypersurface M1 is obtained from the hypersurface M0 by a
translation combined with a homothety x′ = ψ(x) = bx + p, then for each x ∈ M0
with image x′ ∈ M1 the Lorentzian geodesic flow will send the tangent plane Tx M0
to the tangent plane Tx′ M1 by the family of parallel hyperplanes given by Corollary
5.4. Thus, for each 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, the hyperplane under the geodesic flow will be the
tangent plane Txt Mt , where for ψt (x) = (1 + (b − 1)t)x + tp, Mt = ψt (M0 ) and
xt = ψt (x) ∈ Mt . Thus, the Lorentzian geodesic flow will send M0 to the family of
hypersurfaces Mt = ψt (M0 ).
Example 5.6 (Hyperplanes Obtained by a Pseudo-Rotation). Second, suppose
that Π0 and Π1 are nonparallel affine hyperplanes. Then, W = Π0 ∩ Π1 is a codimension 2 affine subspace. The unit normal vectors n0 and n1 lie in the orthogonal
plane W ⊥ with n0 · n1 = cos(θ) with −π/2 < θ < π/2. Since the Lorentzian
geodesic flow commutes with translation, we may translate the planes and assume
that W contains the origin. Then, both c0 and c1 equal 0. Thus, by Proposition
4.1, the Lorentzian geodesic flow from Π0 to Π1 is given by (nt , ct ǫ) for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1,
where
(5.5)

(nt , ct ǫ) = (λ(t, θ) (n1 , c1 ǫ) + λ(1 − t, θ) (n0 , c0 ǫ)

Thus, nt = λ(t, θ)n1 + λ(1 − t, θ)n0 , while ct ≡ 0. Hence, the hyperplane Πt is
defined by nt · x = 0 so it contains W . However, its intersection with the plane W ⊥
is the line orthogonal to nt , which by the above expression for nt , does not give a
standard constant speed rotation in the plane. We refer to this as a pseudo-rotation.
Instead consider a rotation A of hyperplanes Π0 to Π1 about an axis not containing W . We consider the form of the pseudo-rotation. As an example, consider the

14

Figure 4. Lorentzian Geodesic Flow between a hyperplane Π0
and a rotated copy Π1 , where the rotation is about a subspace not
containing W = Π0 ∩ Π1 , is given by a “pseudo–rotation”. The
path of the rotation is indicated by the dotted curve, while that
for the pseudo rotation is given by the curve, which lifts out of the
plane of rotation before returning to it (although it does remain in
a plane parallel to W ⊥ ).
case of a rotation A about the origin in a plane (which pointwise fixes an orthogonal subspace. Choosing coordinates, we may assume that the rotation A is in the
(x1 , x2 )–plane and rotates by an angle ω. We suppose Π0 , defined by n0 ·x = c0 . As
A(n0 ) · A(x) = n0 · x = c0 , if we let x′ = A(x), then the equation of the hyperplane
Π1 is defined by A(n0 ) · x′ = c0 . Hence, n1 = A(n0 ) and c1 = c0 .
To express the geodesic flow, we write n0 = v + p where v is in the rotation
plane and p is fixed by A. Hence, n1 = A(v) + p. Thus, the angle θ between n0
and n1 satisfies
cos θ = n1 · n0 = A(v) · v + p · p
As kn0 k = 1, we obtain v · v + p · p = 1. Also, A(v) · v = kvk2 cos ω. Hence,
cos θ = 1 + kvk2 (cos ω − 1)

(5.6)
We recall that by (4.3)

θ
λ(t, θ) + λ(1 − t, θ) = µ(1 − 2t, )
2
Using the expressions for n0 and n1 , we find the geodesic flow is given by
= λ(t, θ) (A(n0 ), c0 ǫ) + λ(1 − t, θ) (n0 , c0 ǫ)
(5.7)

θ
θ
= ((λ(t, θ)A(v) + λ(1 − t, θ) v) + µ(1 − 2t, ) p, µ(1 − 2t, )c0 ǫ)
2
2

We note that µ(1−2t, 2θ ) is a function of t on [0, 1] which has value = 1 at the end
points, and has a maximum = sec( 12 θ) at t = 12 . Thus, the geodesic flow (nt , ct ǫ)
has the contribution in the rotation plane given by λ(t, θ)A(v) + λ(1 − t, θ)v which
is not a true rotation from v to A(v). Also, the other contribution to nt is from
µ(1 − 2t, θ2 )p which increases and then returns to size p (see Fig. 4). In addition,
the distance from the origin will vary by µ(1 − 2t, θ2 )c0 . This is the form of the
pseudo rotation from Π0 to Π1 . This yields the following corollary.

LORENTZIAN GEODESIC FLOWS

15

Corollary 5.7. If Π1 is obtained from Π0 by rotation in a plane (with fixed orthogonal complement), then the Lorentzian geodesic flow is the family of hypersurfaces
obtained by applying to Π0 the family of pseudo rotations given by (5.7).
6. Families of Lorentzian Parallel Frames on Lorentzian Geodesic Flows
A Lorentzian geodesic flow from hyperplanes Π0 to Π1 may be viewed as a
minimum twisting family of hyperplanes Πt joining Π0 to Π1 . If in addition, we
are given orthonormal frames {ei 0 } for Π0 and {ei 1 } for Π1 , we ask what form
a minimum twisting family of smoothly varying frames {ei t } for Πt should take?
We give the form of the family of “Lorentzian parallel” orthonormal frames in Πt
beginning with {ei 0 }, and then use this family to construct a family of frames from
{ei 0 } to {ei 1 } which can be made to satisfy various criteria for minimal Lorentzian
twisting.
Criterion for Lorentzian Parallel Vector Fields.
Given a smooth curve γ(t), 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 in Rn and a smoothly varying family of
affine hyperplanes {Πt } satisfying:
1) γ(t) ∈ Πt for each t;
2) γ(t) is tranverse Πt for each t.
We let nt denote the smooth family of unit normals to the hyperplanes Πt .
Then there is a corresponding curve in Λn+1 defined by γ̃(t) = (nt , ct ǫ) where
ct =< γ(t), nt >. Let et denote a smooth section of {Πt }, by which we mean that
if we view et as a vector from the point γ(t) lies in the hyperplane Πt for each t.
There is then a corresponding vector field ẽt on γ̃(t)defined by ẽt = (et , β(t)ǫ). This
vector field is tangent to Λn+1 as the vector Nt = (nt , ct ǫ) is Lorentzian normal to
Λn+1 at γ̃(t) so < Nt , ẽt >L =< nt , et >= 0.
We give a criterion for ẽt to be a Lorentzian parallel vector field along γ̃(t).
Lemma 6.1 (Criterion for Lorentzian Parallel Vector Fields). The smooth vector
field ẽt is Lorentzian parallel along γ̃(t) if :
∂et
= ϕ(t)nt for a smooth function ϕ(t)
i)
∂t
R
ii) β(t) = ϕ(t)ct dt for each t.

Proof. As Nt is Lorentzian normal to Λn+1 at γ̃(t), it is sufficient to show that
∂ẽt
= α(t)Nt for some function α(t). Then, by i) and ii)
∂t
∂et ′
∂ẽt
= (
, β (t)) = (ϕ(t)nt , β ′ (t)ǫ)
∂t
∂t
(6.1)
= ϕ(t)(nt , ct ǫ) = ϕ(t)Nt
Hence, ẽt is Lorentzian parallel.



Hence, a smooth section et of {Πt } extends to a Lorentzian parallel vector field
ẽt provided condition i) is satisfied and using condition ii) to define β(t).
Example 6.2. Suppose Πt is the normal hyperplane to γ(t) at the point γ(t) for
each t. Then the condition that et is a section of Πt is that < et , γ ′ (t) >= 0. Then,
by Lemma 6.1 the condition that et is moreover a parallel vector field is that there

16

J. DAMON

∂et
= ϕ(t)γ ′ (t). These two conditions are the
∂t
criteria in [WJZY] and other papers quoted there that for the normal family of
affine planes in R3 the vector field et has “minimum rotation”.

is a smooth function ϕ(t) so that

Remark 6.3. In the case when the family of affine hyperplanes {Πt } are not
normal, then the vectors nt and γ ′ (t) are not parallel so the condition in Lemma
6.1 replaces the role of γ ′ (t) in both conditions by nt .
Then, for each such vector field ζ(t) and smooth function β(t), we define a
smooth tangent vector field to Λn+1 (in fact T n ) along γ(t) by ζ̃(t) = (ζ(t), β(t)ǫ).
We observe that at each point (nt , ct ǫ), ζ̃(t) is Lorentzian orthogonal to (nt , ct ǫ)
and so is tangent to Λn+1 . Moreover, because of the form of ζ̃(t), it is also tangent
to T n . However, there may be no specific choice of β(t) possible for ζ̃(t) to be
a Lorentzian parallel vector field on T n . We say that the smooth section ζ(t) of
{Πt } is a Lorentzian parallel vector field if there is a smooth function β(t) so that
ζ̃(t) is a Lorentzian parallel vector field on T n . For example, in the special case
that the section ζ(t) ≡ v is constant we may choose β(t) ≡ 0, and the vector field
ζ̃(t) = (ζ(t), 0 · ǫ) is constant and so is a Lorentzian parallel vector field.
Thus, given a set of such vector fields {ζi (t) : i = 1, . . . , k} which are sections
of {Πt } together with smooth functions βi (t), then we obtain a set of vector fields
{ζ̃i (t) : i = 1, . . . , k} on γ(t) tangent to T n . Then, the existence of Lorentzian
parallel families of frames for {Πt }is given by the following.
Proposition 6.4. Let γ(t) = (nt , ct ǫ) be a Lorentzian geodesic defining the family
of hyperplanes {Πt } in Rn . If {ei 0 , 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1} is an orthonormal frame for Π0 ,
there is a (smoothly varying) family of orthonormal frames {ei t , , 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1}
for {Πt } such that the vector fields {ẽi t , 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1} form a family of Lorentzian
parallel vector fields on T n which are Lorentzian orthonormal.
Proof. First, if Π0 and Π1 are parallel then Π1 is a translation of Π0 , so by Corollary
5.4 the Lorentzian geodesic flow Πt is a family of hyperplanes parallel to Π0 so the
family of frames is the “constant” family obtained by translating {ei 0 } to each
hyperplane in the family. The corresponding family {ẽi t } is also constant, and
hence Lorentzian parallel.
Next we consider the case where Π0 and Π1 are not parallel. We first construct
the required Lorentzian parallel family beginning with a specific orthonormal frame
for Π0 . Then, we explain how to modify this for a general orthonormal frame.
We have Π0 is defined by n0 · x = c0 , and Π1 , by n1 · x = c1 with n0 · n1 = cos(θ)
for −π/2 < θ < π/2. Then, as earlier in §5, W = Π0 ∩ Π1 is a codimension 2 affine
subspace, and every hyperplane Πt in the Lorentzian geodesic flow γ(t) = (nt , ct ǫ)
from Π0 to Π1 contains W .
We let e2 , . . . , en−1 denote an orthonormal frame for W . Then, the ei define
constant vector fields ei along the Lorentzian geodesic with each ei ∈ W ⊂ Πt .
These allow us to define ẽi , which are parallel vector fields on Λn+1 (in fact T n
along the Lorentzian geodesic γ(t).
Hence, to complete them to an orthonormal frame, we need only construct a
unit vector field e1,t which is a smooth section of {Πt } orthogonal to W for each
0 ≤ t ≤ 1 and show that the resulting vector field ẽ1,t is a Lorentzian parallel vector
field on γ(t).

LORENTZIAN GEODESIC FLOWS

17

The subspace of any Πt orthogonal to W is one dimensional, so there are two
choices for a unit vector spanning it. For Π0 we choose e1,0 so that n0 , e1,0 , e2 , . . . , en−1
is positively oriented for Rn . Likewise we choose e1,1 for Π1 so that n1 , e1,1 , e2 , . . . , en−1
is positively oriented for Rn . Then, we define
(6.2)

e1,t = λ(t, θ)e1,1 + λ(1 − t, θ)e1,0

We first claim that e1,t is a unit vector field such that e1,t ∈ Π̃t for all 0 ≤ t ≤ 1.
That e1,t is a unit vector field follows from the calculation for nt in Proposition
4.1. Second, we compute
e1,t · nt = (λ(t, θ)e1,1 + λ(1 − t, θ)e1,0 ) · (λ(t, θ)n1 + λ(1 − t, θ)n0 )
(6.3)

= (λ(t, θ)λ(1 − t, θ))(e1,1 · n0 + e1,0 · n1 )

To see the RHS of (6.3) is zero, we consider the two positively oriented orthonormal
bases for W ⊥ : n0 , e1,0 and n1 , e1,1 . If we represent n1 = an0 +be1,0, then necessarily
e1,1 = −bn0 + ae1,0 . Then,
e1,1 · n0 + e1,0 · n1 = −b + b = 0
We also note that e1,t is orthogonal to W̃ for all t. Thus, the resulting tangential
vector fields ẽ1,t , ẽ2 , . . . , ẽn−1 are mutually Lorentz orthogonal and are Lorentzian
unit vector fields. The vector fields ẽi , i = 2, . . . , n − 1 are constant and hence
Lorentzian parallel. It remains to show that ẽ1,t is Lorentzian parallel. We claim
that if β(t) = θ1 c′t , then ẽ1,t = (e1,t , β(t) · ǫ) is a Lorentzian parallel tangent vector
field along γ(t). As γ(t) is a Lorentzian geodesic, γ ′ (t) is Lorentzian parallel along
γ(t). We will show that with the given β(t), ẽ1,t = 1θ γ ′ (t).
From the proof of Proposition 4.1, by (4.9), γ(t) can be written
(6.4)

γ(t) = (cos(tθ)n0 + sin(tθ)w, (cos(tθ)c0 +

sin(tθ)
(c1 − cos θ c0 ))ǫ)
sin(θ)

Hence,
(6.5) γ ′ (t) = θ(− sin(tθ)n0 + cos(tθ)w, (− sin(tθ)c0 +

cos(tθ)
(c1 − cos θ c0 ))ǫ)
sin(θ)

⊥
⊥

Both {n0 , n⊥
0 } and {n1 , n1 } have positive orientation in W ; hence e1,0 = n0 and

⊥
e1,1 = n1 If we represent n1 = an0 + bn0 , then n1 = −bn0 + an0 and in (6.5) the
⊥
unit vector w = n⊥
0 if b > 0 and −n0 if b < 0.
Second we represent e1,t in the same form as (6.4). To do so we compute the
⊥
unit vector in the same direction as the projection of e1,1 (= n⊥
1 ) along e1,0 (= n0 ).
Then, by the above, e1,1 = −bn0 + ae1,0 . Thus, the corresponding w for this case
⊥
is either w1 = −n⊥
0 if b > 0 or n0 if b < 0. Thus, by the calculation in the proof
of Proposition 4.1, in either case we obtain

e1,t = cos(tθ)n⊥
0 + sin(tθ)e1,0
(6.6)

= − sin(tθ)n0 + cos(tθ)n⊥
0

This equals the first component of (6.5), which implies the equality e1,t = θ1 n′t .
The last step is to obtain the result for any orthonormal frame {fi,0 } in Π0 .
There is an orthogonal transformation A so that A(ei,0 ) = fi,0 . If we express
Pn−1
Pn−1
fi,0 = j=1 ai,j ej,0 . Then, we can define vector fields f˜i,t = j=1 ai,j ẽj,t . Since
the f˜i,t are constant linear combinations of Lorentzian parallel vector fields,and
hence are Lorentzian parallel themselves. As they are obtained by an orthogonal

18

transformation of an orthonormal frame field, they also form an orthonormal frame
field.

Interpolating between Orthonormal Frames. Now we consider given frames
{ei,0 } in Π0 and {fi,1 } in Π1 , such that {n0 , e1,0 , . . . , en−1,0 } and {n1 , f1,0 , . . . , fn−1,0 }
have the same orientation (which we may assume are positive. We may first construct the Lorentzian parallel family of orthonormal frames {ei,t }. Then, the
smoothly varying family {nt , e1,t , . . . , en−1,t } will retain positive orientation for
each t. Hence, {ei,1 } and {fi,1 } have the same orientation. Thus, there is an orthogonal transformation B of Π1 such that B(ei,1 ) = fi,1 and det(B) = 1. Again we
may represent B using the basis {ei,1 } by an orthogonal matrix bi,j . As det(B) = 1,
there is a one parameter family exp(sE) so that exp(E) = B for a skew symmetric
matrix E. Then, given a smooth nondecreasing function ϕ : [0, 1] → [0, 1] with
ϕ(0) = 0 and ϕ(1) = 1, we can modify the Lorentzian parallel family {ei,t } by
{exp(ϕ(t)E)(ei,t )}, which is a family of orthonormal frames. In this family we see
that the “total amount of twisting” from Lorentzian parallel family is given by the
orthogonal transformation B (or skew-symmetric matrix E). The introduction of
the twisting in the family is given by the function ϕ.
Example 6.5 (Planes in R3 ). In the case of planes Π0 and Π1 in R3 with n0 6= ±n1
and n0 · n1 = cos(θ), we can easily construct the family of Lorentzian parallel
frames by letting e2,t be a constant unit vector field in the direction of n0 × n1 , and
ẽ1,t = θ1 n′t for the Lorentzian geodesic flow γ(t) = (nt , ct ) from Π0 to Π1 . Then,
{e1,t , e2,t } gives a Lorentzian parallel family of frames.
If e′1 , e′2 is another frame for Π0 with the same orientation as e1,0 , e2,0 , then there
is a rotation with rotation matrix R so that Rei,0 = e′i . Then {Re1,t , Re2,t } gives a
Lorentzian parallel family of frames beginning with e′1 , e′2 . Furthermore, if {f1 , f2 }
is a positively oriented frame for Π1 , then there is a rotation matrix Sω by an
angle ω so that Sω Rei,1 = fi . Then, for ω(t), 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, a nondecreasing smooth
function from 0 to 1, the family of rotations Sω(t) provides an interpolating family
{Sω(t) Re1,t , Sω(t) Re2,t } from {e1,0 , e2,t } to {f1 , f2 }. The flexibility in the choice of
ω(t) allows for many criterion to be included in choosing the interpolation.
Remark 6.6 (Interpolation for Modeling Generalized Tube Structures). Generalized tube structures for a region Ω can be modeled as a disjoint union Ω = ∪t Ωt
of planar regions Ωt ⊂ Πt for a family of hyperplanes {Πt } along a central curve
γ(t). The geometric properties and structure of the tube can be computed using
a smoothly varying family of frames ej,t for {Πt } (see e.g. [D2] and [D3]). This is
used in [MZW] for the 3-dimensional modeling of the human colon, where normal
planes to an identified central curve are modified in high curvature regions to form a
Lorentzian geodesic, and the family of frames with minimal twisting in the sense of
Example 6.2 are extended to a Lorentzian parallel family of frames in the modified
family of planes. This structure can then be deformed in various ways for better
visualization.
Example 6.7 (Family of Normal Planes to a Curve in R3 ). A second situation
is for a regular unit speed curve α(t) in R3 with κ 6= 0. Then there is the Frenet
frame {T, N, B} defined along α(t). Then, {N, B} provides a family of orthonormal
frame for the planes Πt passing through and orthogonal to α(t). The Lorentzian

LORENTZIAN GEODESIC FLOWS

19

map for the family of planes is given by γ(t) = (T(t), α · α′ ǫ). Then,
d2
(α · α′ )ǫ)
d2 t
Thus, for this family to be a Lorentzian geodesic family of planes, γ ′′ (t) must be
Lorentzian orthogonal to Λ4 . For this, we must have that the first term is a multiple
of T, which implies κ′ , τ ≡ 0. Thus, α is a plane curve with constant curvature κ,
so it is a portion of a circle and α · α′ ≡ 0. Then, B is constant so it is Lorentzian
parallel, and γ ′′ (t) = (−κ2 T, 0ǫ) = −κ(−κT, 0ǫ), and so it follows that (N, 0ǫ) is
Lorentzian parallel. Hence, {N, B} is a Lorentzian parallel family of orthonormal
frames. We summarize this with the following
γ ′′ (t) = κ′ N + κ(−κT + τ B),

Proposition 6.8. If α(t) is a regular unit speed curve in R3 with κ 6= 0, then
the family of normal planes Πt to α(t) is a Lorentzian geodesic family iff α(t) is a
portion of a circle. In this case the Frenet vector fields {N, B} forms a Lorentzian
parallel family of orthonormal frames in Πt .

7. Dual Varieties and Singular Lorentzian Manifolds
Before continuing with the analysis of the geodesic flow in Λn+1 and the induced
flow between hypersurfaces in Rn , we first explain the relation of the Lorentzian
map with a corresponding map to the dual projective space.
Relation with the Dual Variety. Suppose that M ⊂ Rn is a smooth hypersurface. There is a natural way to associate a corresponding “dual variety”M ∨
in the dual projective space RP n ∨ (which consists of lines through the origin in
n+1 ∗
the dual
). Given a hyperplane Π ⊂ Rn , it is defined by an equaPn space R
b. We associate the linear form α : Rn+1 → R defined by

α(x1 , . . . , xn+1 ) = i=1 ai xi − bxn+1 . As the equation for Π is only well defined
up to multiplication by a constant, so is α, which defines a unique line in Rn+1 ∗ .
This then defines a dual mapping δ : M → RP n ∨ , sending x ∈ M to the dual of
Tx M .
In the context of algebraic geometry in the complex case, this map actually extends to a dual map for a smooth codimension 1 algebraic subvariety M ⊂ CP n , and
then the image M ∨ = δ(M ) is again a codimension 1 algebraic subvariety of CP n ∨ .
There is an inverse dual map δ ∨ for smooth codimension 1 algebraic subvarieties
of CP n ∨ to CP n defined again using the tangent spaces. Hence, δ ∨ : M ∨ → CP n .
It is only defined on smooth points of M ∨ (which may have singularities); however
it extends to the singular points of M ∨ and its image is the original M .
In our situation, we are working over the reals and moreover M will not be
defined algebraically. Hence, we need to determine what properties both δ and M ∨
have. We also will explain the relation with the Lorentz map.
Legendrian Projections. Given M , we let P (Rn+1 ∗ ) denote the projective bundle over Rn given by Rn ×RP n ∨ , where as earlier RP n ∨ denotes the dual projective
space. Then, we have an embedding i : M → P (Rn+1 ∗ ), where i(x) = (x, < αx >),
with αx the linear form associated to Tx M as above. We let M̃ = i(M ). There is
a projection map π : P (Rn+1 ∗ ) → RP n ∨ . Then, by results of Arnol’d [A1], π is a
Legendrian projection, and for generic M , M̃ is a generic Legendrian submanifold

20

of P (Rn+1 ∗ ) and the restriction π|M̃ : M̃ → RP n ∨ is a generic Legendrian projection. This composition π|M̃ ◦ i is exactly δ. Hence, the properties of δ are exactly
those of the Legendrian projection. In particular, the singularities of M ∨ = π(M̃ )
are generic Legendrian singularities, which are the singularities appearing in discriminants of stable mappings, see [A1] or [AGV, Vol 2].
In the case of surfaces in R3 , these are: cuspidal edge, a swallowtail, transverse
intersections of two or three smooth surfaces, and the transverse intersection of a
smooth surface with a cuspidal edge (as shown in Fig. 5). The characterization
of these singularities implies that as we approach a singular point from one of the
connected components, then there is a unique limiting tangent plane, and in the
case of the cuspidal edge or swallowtail, the limiting tangent plane is the same for
each component. Hence, for generic smooth hypersurfaces M ⊂ Rn , the inverse
dual map δ ∨ extends to all of M ∨ , and again will have image M .

Legendrian surfaces: a) cuspidal edge, b) swallowtail, c) transverse
intersection of cuspidal edge and smooth surface, d) transverse

of three smooth surfaces.
Finally, we remark about the relation between the dual variety M ∨ and the
image ML = L(M ) (or ML̃ = L̃(M )). To do so, we introduce a mapping involving
RP n ∨ and T̃ n . In RP n ∨ , there is the distinguished point ∞ =< (0, . . . , 0, 1) >.
On RP n ∨ \{∞}, we may take a point < (y1 , . . . , yn , yn+1 ) >, and normalize it by

) = c · (y1 , . . . , yn , yn+1 ),

where c = (

Then, ny =
is a unit vector. We then define a map ν : RP n ∨ \{∞} →
n
′
T̃ sending < (y1 , . . . , yn , yn+1 ) > to (ny , yn+1
ǫ). This is only well-defined up to
multiplication by −1, which is why we must take the equivalence class in the pair
of points. If we are on a region of RP n ∨ \{∞} where we can smoothly choose a
direction for each line corresponding to a point in RP n ∨ , then as for the case of

LORENTZIAN GEODESIC FLOWS

21

the Lorentzian mapping, we can give a well-defined map to T n . This will be so
when we consider M ∨ for the oriented case. In such a situation, when the smooth
hypersurface M has a smooth unit normal vector field n, it provides a positive
direction in the line of linear forms vanishing on Tx M .
Then, we have the following relations.
Lemma 7.1. The smooth mapping ν̃ : RP n ∨ \{∞} → T̃ n is a diffeomorphism.
Second, there is the relation between the duality map δ and the Lorentz map L̃
(or L).
Lemma 7.2. If M ⊂ Rn is a smooth hypersurface, then the diagram (7.1) commutes, i.e. ν̃ ◦ δ = L̃. If, in addition, M has a smooth unit normal vector field n,
then there is the oriented version of diagram (7.1), ν ◦ δ = L.

As a consequence of these Lemmas and our earlier discussion about the singularities of M ∨ , we conclude that ML̃ (or ML ) have the same singularities. Thus,
we may suppose they are generic Legendrian singularities.
Remark 7.3. Although by Lemma 7.1 RP n ∨ \{∞} is diffeomorphic to T̃ n , the
first space has a natural Riemannian structure while on T̃ n we have a Lorentzian
metric. Hence, ν̃ is not an isometry and does not map geodesics to geodesics.
Proof of Lemma 7.1. There is a natural inverse to ν̃ defined as follows: If z = (n, cǫ)
and n = (a1 , . . . , an ), then we map z to < (a1 , . . . , an , −c) >. We note that
replacing z by −z does not change the line < (a1 , . . . , an , −c) >. This gives a welldefined smooth map T̃ n → RP n ∨ \{∞} which is easily checked to be the inverse of
ν̃.

Proof of Lemma 7.2. If Tx M is defined by n · x = c with n = (a1 , . . . , an ), then
δ(x) =< (a1 , . . . , an , −c) >. Then, as knk = 1, ν̃(< (a1 , . . . , an , −c) >) =
(a1 , . . . , an , c, c) = (n, cǫ), which is exactly L(x).

Inverses of the Dual Variety and Lorentzian Mappings. We consider how
to invert both δ and L̃. We earlier remarked that in the complex algebraic setting,
the inverse to δ is again a dual map δ ∨ . As ν̃ is a diffeomorphism, and diagram 7.1
commutes, inverting δ is equivalent to inverting L̃. Also, constructing an inverse is
a local problem, so we may as well consider the oriented case.
Proposition 7.4. Let M ⊂ Rn be a generic smooth hypersurface with a smooth unit
normal vector field n. Suppose that the image ML under L is a smooth submanifold
of T n . Then, M is obtained as the envelope of the collection of hyperplanes defined
by n · x = c for L(x) = (n, cǫ).
Proof of Proposition 7.4. We consider an (n − 1)-dimensional submanifold of T n
parametrized by u ∈ U given by (n(u), c(u)ǫ). The collection of hyperplanes are
given by Πu defined by F (x, u) = n(u) · x − c(u) = 0. Then, the envelope is defined

22

J. DAMON

by the collection of equations Fui = 0, i = 1, . . . , n − 1 and F = 0. This is the
system of linear equations
(7.2)

i) n(u) · x = c(u)

and ii) nui (u) · x = cui (u), i = 1, . . . , n − 1

A sufficient condition that there exist for a given u a unique solution to the
system of linear equations in x is that the vectors n, nu1 , . . . , nun−1 are linearly
∂
), for S the shape operator for M , linear indeindependent. Since nui = −S(
∂ui
pendence is equivalent to S not having any 0-eigenvalues. Thus, x is not a parabolic
point of M . For generic M , the set of parabolic points is a stratified set of codimension 1 in M . Thus, off the image of this set, there is a unique point in the
envelope.
Also, if we differentiate equation (7.2)-i) with respect to ui we obtain
(7.3)

nui (u) · x + n(u) · xui = cui (u)

Combining this with (7.2)-ii), we obtain
(7.4)

n(u) · xui = 0,

and conversely, (7.4) for i = 1, . . . , n−1 and (7.3) imply (7.2)-ii). Thus, if we choose
a local parametrization of M given by x(u), then as x(u) is a point in its tangent
space, it satisfies (7.2)-i), and hence (7.3), and also n being a normal vector field
implies that (7.4) is satisfied for all i. Thus, (7.2)-ii) is satisfied. Hence, M is part
of the envelope. Also, for generic points of M , by the implicit function theorem,
the set of solutions of (7.2) is locally a submanifold of dimension n − 1. Hence, in
a neighborhood of these generic points of M , the envelope is exactly M . Hence,
the closure of this set is all of M and still consists of solutions of (7.2). Thus, we
recover M .
Second, to see that the equations (7.2) describe the inverse of the dual mapping,
we note by Lemmas 7.1 and 7.1 that ν̃ is a diffeomorphism, δ −1 = L̃−1 ◦ ν̃, and the
preceding argument gives the local inverse to L̃.

8. Sufficient Condition for Smoothness of Envelopes
To describe the induced “geodesic flow”between hypersurfaces M0 and M1 in
Rn , we will use the Lorentzian geodesic flow in T n and then find the corresponding flow by applying an inverse to L. We begin by constructing the inverse for
a (n − 1)-dimensional manifold in T n parametrized by (n(u), c(u)ǫ), where u =
(u1 , . . . , un−1 ). We determine when the associated family of hyperplanes Πu =
{x ∈ Rn : n(u) · x = c(u)} has as an envelope a smooth hypersurface in Rn .
We introduce a family of vectors in Rn+1 given by ñ(u) = (n(u), −c(u)). We also
∂ ñ
denote
by ñui . Next we consider the n-fold cross product in Rn+1 , denoted
∂ui
by v1 × v2 × · · · × vn , which is the vector in Rn+1 whose i-th coordinate is (−1)i+1
times the n × n determinant obtained from the entries of v1 , . . . , vn by removing
the i-th entries of each vj . Then, for any other vector v,
v · (v1 × v2 × · · · × vn ) = det(v, v1 , . . . , vn )
We let
h̃ = ñ × ñu1 × · · · × ñun−1

LORENTZIAN GEODESIC FLOWS

23

We let H(ñ) denote the (n − 1) × (n − 1) matrix of vectors ñui uj . Then we can
form H(ñ) · h̃ to be the (n − 1) × (n − 1) matrix with entries ñui uj · h̃. Then, there
is the following determination of the properties of the envelope of {Πu }.
Proposition 8.1. Suppose we have an (n−1)-dimensional manifold in T n parametrized
by (n(u), c(u)ǫ), where u = (u1 , . . . , un−1 ). We let {Πu } denote the associated family of hyperplanes. Then, the envelope of {Πu } has the following properties.
i) There is a unique point x0 on the envelope corresponding to u0 provided
n(u0 ), nu1 (u0 ), . . . , nun−1 (u0 ) are linearly independent. Then, the point is
the solution of the system of equations (7.2).
ii) Provided i) holds, the envelope is smooth at x0 provided H(ñ) · h̃ is nonsingular for u = u0 .
iii) Provided ii) holds, the normal to the surface at x0 is n(u0 ) and Πu0 is the
tangent plane at x0 .
Proof of Proposition 8.1. We use the line of reasoning for Proposition 7.4. the
condition that a point x0 belong to the envelope of {Πu } is that it satisfy the system
of equations (7.2). A sufficient condition that these equations have a unique solution
for u = u0 is exactly that n(u0 ), nu1 (u0 ), . . . , nun−1 (u0 ) are linearly independent.
Furthermore, if this is true at u0 then it is true in a neighborhood of u0 . Thus,
we have a unique smooth mapping x(u) from a neighborhood of u0 to Rn . By the
argument used to deduce (7.4), we also conclude
(8.1)

n(u) · xui = 0,

i = 1, . . . , n − 1

Hence, if x(u) is nonsingular at u0 , then n(u0 ) is the normal vector to the envelope
hypersurface at x0 , so the tangent plane is Πu0 . Thus iii) is true.
It remains to establish the criterion for smoothness in ii). As earlier mentioned
the envelope in the neighborhood of a point x0 is the discriminant of the projection
of V = {(x, u) : F (x, u) = n(u)·x−c(u) = 0} to Rn . It is a standard classical result
that at a point (x0 , u0 ) ∈ V , which projects to an envelope point x0 , the envelope
is smooth at x0 provided (x0 , u0 ) is a regular point of F (so V is smooth in a
∂2F
neighborhood of (x0 , u0 )) and the partial Hessian (
(x0 , u0 )) is nonsingular.
∂ui uj
For our particular F this Hessian becomes H(n) · x0 − H(c), where H(n) is the
(n−1)×(n−1) matrix of vectors (nui uj ), and H(n)·x0 denotes the (n−1)×(n−1)
matrix whose entries are nui uj · x0 . This can also be written H(ñ) · x̃0 , where x̃0
is the extension of x0 to Rn+1 by adding 1 as the n + 1-st coordinate.
Now x0 is the unique solution of the system of linear equations (7.2). This
solution is given by Cramer’s rule. Let N (u0 ) denote the n×n matrix with columns
n(u0 ), nu1 (u0 ), . . . , nun−1 (u0 ). By Cramer’s rule, if we multiply x̃0 by det(N (u0 ))
we obtain (−1)n h̃. Thus, multiplying H(ñ)· x̃0 by det(N (u0 )) yields (−1)n H(ñ)· h̃.
∂2F
(x0 , u0 )).

Hence, the nonsingularity of H(ñ) · h̃ implies that of (
∂ui uj
Although Proposition 8.1 handles the case of a smooth manifold in T n , we saw
in §7 that usually the image in T n of a generic hypersurface M in Rn will have
Legendrian singularities and the image itself is a Whitney stratified set M̃ . Next,
we deduce the condition ensuring that the envelope is smooth at a singular point
x0 .

24

J. DAMON

Because M̃ has Legendrian singularities, it has a special property. To expain it
we use a special property which holds for certain Whitney stratified sets.
Definition 8.2. An m-dimensional Whitney stratified set M ⊂ Rk has the Unique
Limiting Tangent Space Property (ULT property) if for any x ∈ Msing , a singular
point of M , there is a unique m-plane Π ⊂ Rk such that for any sequence {xi } of
smooth points in Mreg such that lim xi = x, we have lim Txi M = Π
Lemma 8.3. For a generic Legendrian hypersurfaces M ⊂ Rn , if z ∈ M̃ , then
M̃ can be locally represented in a neighborhood of z as a finite transverse union of
(n − 1)-dimensional Whitney stratified sets Yi each having the ULT property.
Transverse union means that if Wij is the stratum of Yi containing z than the
Wij intersect transversally.
Proof. The Lemma follows because M̃ consists of generic Legendrian singularities,
which are either stable (or topologically stable) Legendrian singularities. These are
either discriminants of stable unfoldings of multigerms of hypersurface singularities
or transverse sections of such. Such discriminants are transverse unions of discriminants of individual hypersurface singularities, each of which have the ULT property
by a result of Saito [Sa]. This continues to hold for transverse sections.

We shall refer to these as the local components of M̃ in a neighborhood of z.
There is then a corollary of the preceding.
Corollary 8.4. Suppose that M̃ is an (n − 1)–dimensional Whitney stratified set
in T n such that: at every smooth point z of M̃ , the hypotheses of Proposition 8.1
holds; and at all singular points M̃ is locally the finite union of Whitney stratified
sets Yi each having the ULT property. Then,
i) The envelope of M of M̃ has a unique point x ∈ M for each z ∈ M̃reg , and
M is smooth at all points corresponding to points in M̃reg .
ii) At each singular point z of M̃ , there is a point in M corresponding to each
local component of M̃ in a neighborhood of z.
Proof. First, if z ∈ M̃reg and satisfies the conditions of Proposition 8.1, then there
is a unique envelope point corresponding to z and the envelope is smooth at that
point.
Second, via the isomorphism ν̃ and the commutative diagram (3.1), the envelope
construction corresponds to the inverse δ ∨ of δ (or rather a local version since
we have an orientation). Under the isomorphism ν̃, for each point z ∈ M̃sing
there corresponds a unique point in the envelope for each local component of M̃
containing z. It is obtained as δ ∨ applied to the unique limiting tangent space of z
associated to the local component in M̃reg .

9. Induced Geodesic Flow between Hypersurfaces
We can bring together the results of the previous sections to define the Lorentzian
geodesic flow between two smooth generic hypersurfaces with a correspondence. We
denote our hypersurfaces by M0 and M1 and let χ : M0 → M1 be a diffeomorphism
giving the correspondence. Note that we allow the hypersurfaces to have boundaries.
We suppose that both are oriented with unit normal vector fields n0 and n1 . We
also need to know that they have a “local relative orientation”.

LORENTZIAN GEODESIC FLOWS

25

Definition 9.1. We say that the oriented manifolds M0 and M1 , with unit normal
vector fields n0 and n1 , and with correspondence χ : M0 → M1 are relatively
oriented if there is a smooth function θ(x) : M0 → (−π, π) such that n0 (x) ·
n1 (χ(x)) = θ(x) for all x ∈ M0 .
An example of a Lorentzian geodesic flow between curves in R2 is illustrated in
Figure 6.

M0
M1

Figure 6. A nonsingular Lorentzian Geodesic Flow between the
curve M0 in R2 and the curve M1 , which was obtained from M0
via a composition of a rigid motion and a homothety. The correspondence is given by the combined transformations, and then
the relative orientation is a constant angle. As remarked in b) of
Figure 2 there does not exist a nonsingular geodesic flow between
M0 and M1 in R2 .
If the preceding example in Figure 6 is slightly perturbed, then the existence of
a nonsingular Lorentzian flow is guaranteed by the next theorem.
Theorem 9.2 ( Existence, Smooth Dependence and Stability of Lorentzian
Geodesic Flows ).
Suppose smooth generic hypersurfaces M0 and M1 are oriented by smooth unit
normal vector fields ni , i = 0, 1 and are relatively oriented by θ for the diffeomorphism χ : M0 → M1 .
(1) (Existence and Smoothness:) Then for the given relative orientation, is a
smooth Lorentzian geodesic flow ψt : M0 × [0, 1] → T n between M0 and M1
given by (9.1).
(2) (Stability:) There is a neighborhood U of χ in Diff (M0 , M1 ) (for the C ∞ –
topology) such that if χ′ ∈ U, then M0 and M1 are relatively oriented for
χ′ and the map Ψ : U → C ∞ (M0 × [0, 1], T n ) mapping χ′ to the associated
Lorentzian flow ψ̃t′ is continuous.
(3) (Smooth Dependence:) Let χs : M0 s → M1 s be a smooth family of diffeomorphisms between smooth families of hypersurfaces for s ∈ S, a smooth
manifold (i.e. Mi s is the image of Mi × S under a smooth family of embeddings) so that M0 s and M1 s are relatively oriented for χs for each s
by a smooth map θ(x, s) : M0 s → (−π, π) in (x, s). Then, the family of

26

J. DAMON

Lorentzian Geodesic flows ψ̃s,t : M0 × S × [0, 1] → T n between M0 s and
M1 s is a smooth function of (x, s, t).
Proof. Using the form of the Lorentzian geodesic flow given by Proposition 4.1 we
have the Lorentzian geodesic flow is defined by
(9.1)

ψt (x)

=

λ(t, θ(x)) z1 (x) + λ(1 − t, θ(x)) z0 (x)

for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1

Here z0 (x) = (n0 (x), c0 (x)) for Tx M0 defined by n0 (x) · x = c0 (x), and z1 (x) =
(n1 (x), c1 (x)) for Tχ(x) M1 defined by n1 (x) · x = c1 (x). As zi (x) and θ(x) depend
smoothly on x ∈ M and λ(t, θ) is smooth on [0, 1]×(−π, π), ψt (x) is smooth in (x, t).
Hence, the Lorentzian flow is a smooth well-defined flow between (n0 (x), c0 (x)ǫ)
and (n1 (χ(x)), c1 (χ(x))ǫ)
For smooth dependence 3), we use an analogous argument. We use (9.1) but with
θ(x) replaced by θ(x, s) and each zi (x) by zi (x, s) = (n1 (x, s), c1 (x, s)) where Tx M0 s
is defined by n0 (x, s)·x = c0 (x, s) and Tχ(x,s) M1 s is defined by n1 (x, s)·x = c1 (x, s).
Finally to establish the stability, given χ for which M0 and M1 are relatively oriented via the smooth function θ(x), we let δ(x) be a smooth nonvanishing function
such that δ(x) < 1/3(π − θ(x)) and lim δ(x) = 0 as x approaches any “unbounded
boundary component at ∞” of M0 . Then, as (−π, π) is contractible there is a
Whitney open neighborhood U of χ such that if χ′ ∈ U then there is a smooth
θ′ : M0 → (−π, π) such that n0 (x) · n1 (χ′ (x)) = cos(θ′ (x)) and |θ′ (x) − θ(x)| < δ(x)
for all x ∈ M0 . Furthermore, θ′ depends continuously on χ′ . Thus, the corresponding flow in (9.1) defined by θ′ depends continuously on χ′ .
Specifically, given χ′ ∈ U, consider the mapping χ′L : M0 → T n × T n defined
by x 7→ ((n0 (x), c0 (x)), (n1 (x), c1 (x))), where (n0 (x), c0 (x)) defines the tangent
space Tx M0 and (n1 (x), c1 (x)) defines the tangent space Tχ′ (x) M1 . Then, χ′L is
defined using the first derivatives of the embeddings Mi ⊂ Rn and χ′ composed
with algebraic operations. Each such operation is continous in the Whitney C ∞ –
topology and so defines a continuous map L′ : U → C ∞ (M0 , T n × T n ). Lastly, the
Lorentzian flow ψt is defined by (4.4), and is the composition of L′ with algebraic
operations involving the smooth functions λ(x, θ), and is again continuous in the
C ∞ –topology. Hence, the combined composition mapping χ′ → ψt is continuous in
the C ∞ –topology.

Remark . We note there are two consequences of 2) of Theorem 9.2. First, M0
and M1 may remain fixed, but the correspondence χ varies in a family. Then the
corresponding Lorentzian geodesic flows vary in a family. Second, M0 and M1 may
vary in a family with a corresponding varying correspondence, then the Lorentzian
geodesic flow will also vary smoothly in a family.
Nonsingularity of Level Hypersurfaces of Lorentzian Geodesic Flows in
Rn .
It remains to determine when the corresponding Lorentzian geodesic flows in
Rn will have analogous properties. We give a criterion involving a generalized
eigenvalue for a pair of matrices.
We consider the vector fields on M0 , n0 (x) and n1 (χ(x)). For any vector field
n(x) on M0 with values in Rn , we let N (x) = (n(x) | dn(x)) be the n × n matrix
with columns n(x) viewed as a column vector and dn(x) the n × (n − 1) Jacobian
matrix. If we have a local parametrization x(u) of M0 , then we may represent the

LORENTZIAN GEODESIC FLOWS

27

vector field n as a function of u, n(u). Then, N (x(u)) is the n × n matrix with
columns n(u), nu1 (u), . . . , nun−1 (u). We denote this matrix for n0 by N0 (x), and
that for n1 (χ(x)) by N1 (x) (or N0 (u) and N1 (χ(u)) if we have parametrized M0 ).
By i) of Proposition 8.1 the Lorentzian geodesic flow in Rn will be well-defined
provided the corresponding matrix Nt (x) is nonsingular at all points of the flow
ψ̃t (x). We determine this by decomposing Nt (x) into two parts.
First, there is the parametrized family of n × n–matrices
et (x) def
N
= λ(t, θ) N1 (x) + λ(1 − t, θ) N0 (x)

(9.2)

This captures the change resulting from the change in x. To also capture the
∂θ
change resulting from that in θ, we introduce a second matrix
n0 whose first
∂u
∂θ
n0 , for
column equals the vector 0 and whose j + 1–th column is the vector
∂uj
j = 1, . . . , n − 1. Then, the nonsingularity criterion will be based on whether the
∂θ
pair of matrices (Ñt (x),
n0 ) does not have a specific generalized eigenvalue.

ψ̃t (M0 ), and we let Mt denote the envelope of M̃t .
Then there are the following properties for the envelopes Mt of the flow for all

Theorem 9.3. Suppose smooth generic hypersurfaces M0 and M1 are oriented by
smooth unit normal vector fields ni , i = 0, 1 and are relatively oriented by θ(u). Let
ψ̃t be the Lorentzian geodesic flow between M̃0 and M̃1 which is smooth. If Mt is
the family of envelopes obtained from the flow M̃t = ψ̃t (M̃0 ), then suppose that for
each time t, M̃t has only generic Legendrian singularities as in §7 (as e.g. in Fig.
5). Then,

(1) Mt will have a unique point corresponding to z = ψ̃t (x) ∈ M̃t provided (9.4)
is nonsingular.
(2) The envelope Mt will be smooth at points corresponding to a smooth point
z ∈ M̃t satisfying (9.4) provided H(ñt (x))· h̃t (x) is nonsingular. Here h̃t (x)
is defined from ñt (x) as in §8.
(3) At points corresponding to singular points z ∈ M̃t , there is a unique point
on Mt for each local component of M̃ in a neighborhood of z. This point
is the unique limit of the envelope points corresponding to smooth points of
the component of M̃t approaching z.
Remark 9.4. We observe that as a result of Theorem 9.3, we can remark about the
uniqueness of the resulting geodesic flow from non-parabolic points of M0 . Then,
N0 (u) is non singular for each non-parabolic point x(u). If N1 (χ(u)) is sufficiently
et (u) will be nonsingular. This is given by a C 1 -condition on

and n1 (χ(u)), has small variation as a function of u, then the term σ(t, θ)

be small in the C 0 sense. Thus, if it is sufficiently small, then together with the C 1
closeness of (nonsingular) N0 (u) and N1 (χ(u)) implies that Nt′ (u) is nonsingular.
Hence, by i) of Theorem 9.3 the flow is uniqely defined. Together these are C 2
conditions on N0 (u) and N1 (χ(u)).
Proof of Theorem 9.3 . For 2), given that 1) holds, we may apply ii) of Proposition 8.1. For 3) we may apply Corollary 8.4. To prove 1), we will apply i) of
Proposition 8.1. We must give a sufficient condition that Nt (x) is nonsingular for
0 ≤ t ≤ 1. We choose local coordinates u for a neighborhood of x0 . For a geodesic
(nt (u), ct (u)ǫ) between (n0 (u), c0 (u)ǫ) and (n1 (u), c1 (u)ǫ) given by (4.4), we must
compute nt ui (u). We note that not only ni , i = 1, 2 but also θ depends on u. We
obtain

Remark . If n1 (χ(x0 )) 6= n0 (x0 ), then there is a neighborhood x0 ∈ W ⊂ M0 such
that n1 (χ(x)) 6= n0 (x) for x ∈ W . Then, there is a smooth unit tangent vector field
w defined on W such that n1 (χ(x)) lies in the vector space spanned by n0 (x) and
w(x), and n1 (χ(x)) · w(x) ≥ 0 for all x ∈ W . Then, smoothness follows explicitly
using the geodesics given in Proposition 4.1 by (4.4).

10. Results for the Case of Surfaces in R3
Now we consider the special case of surfaces Mi ⊂ R3 , i = 1, 2 for which there
is a correspondence given by the diffeomorphism χ : M0 → M1 . We suppose
each Mi is a generic smooth surface with n0 = (a1 , a2 , a3 ) and n1 = (a′1 , a′2 , a′3 )
smooth unit normal vector fields on M0 , respectively M1 . We assume that X(u1 , u2 )
is a local parametrization of M0 . Each ai is a function of (u1 , u2 ) via the local
parametrization X(u1 , u2 ). Likewise, each a′i is a function of (u1 , u2 ) via the local
parametrization χ ◦ X(u1 , u2 ) Also, let ni (u) · x = ci (u) define the tangent planes
for M0 at X(u1 , u2 ), respectively M1 at χ(X(u1 , u2 )).
We let
nt = (a1 t , a2 t , a3 t ) = λ(t, θ) (a′1 , a′2 , a′3 ) + λ(1 − t, θ) (a1 , a2 , a3 )
and ct (u) = λ(t, θ) c1 + λ(1 − t, θ) c0 . Then,

a1 t a1 t,u1

Nt = a2 t a2 t,u1

Remark . Note here and what follows we use the following notation. For quantities
defined for a flow, we denote dependence on t by a subscript. We also want to denote
partial derivatives with respect to the parameters ui by a subscript. To distinguish
them, the subscripts appearing after a comma will denote the partial derivatives.

Existence of Envelope Points. The sufficient condition that there is a unique point
Xt0 (u) in the Lorentzian geodesic flow in R3 at time t = t0 is that (10.1) evaluated
at t = t0 and u = (u1 , u2 ) is nonsingular. Then, the unique point is the solution of
the linear system.

Smoothness of the Envelope. For the smoothness of Mt0 at the point Xt0 (u1 , u2 ),
we let
ñt0 = (a1 t0 , a2 t0 , a3 t0 , −ct0 )
evaluated at u = (u1 , u2 ). Also, we let h̃t0 = ñt0 × ñt0 u1 × ñt0 u1 , which is the
analogue of the cross product but for vectors in R4 . It is the vector whose j–th
entry is (−1)j+1 times by taking the 3 × 3 determinant of the submatrix obtained
by deleting the j–th column of

Then, we form the 2×2–matrix H(ñt (u))· h̃t ) with ij–th entry nt,ui uj (u) · h̃t (u)
for u = (u1 , u2 ). Then, from Theorem 9.3, we conclude that for a point uniquely
defined by (10.2) the envelope is smooth at Xt0 (u) if H(ñt0 (u)) · h̃t0 (u) is nonsingular.

Envelope Points corresponding to Legendrian Singular Points. Third, the generic
Legendrian singularities for surfaces are those given in Fig. 5). For these:
(1) At points on cuspidal edges or swallowtail points z ∈ M̃t , there is a unique
point on Mt which is the unique limit of the envelope points corresponding
to smooth points of M̃t approaching z.
(2) At points z ∈ M̃t which are tranverse intersections of two or three smooth
surfaces, or the transverse intersection of a smooth surface and a cuspidal
edge, there is a unique point in Mt for each smooth surface passing through
z (and one for the cuspidal edge).
Example 10.1. As an example, we consider the Lorentzian geodesic flows between
the surfaces M1 given by z = 2 − .2(x2 + y 2 ), M2 given by z = .5 − .05(x2 + y 2 ),
and M3 given by z = 4 − .5(x2 + y 2 ). We consider two correspondences and the
resulting Lorentzian geodesic flow between them. The first assigns to each point
in M1 the point in M3 with the same coordinates (x, y) so the points on the same
vertical lines correspond. For the second, each point in M2 corresponds to the point

LORENTZIAN GEODESIC FLOWS

31

in M3 in the same vertical line. For the third, we assign to each point (x, y, z) of
M2 the point ( 52 x, 25 y, 52 z + 3.2) in M3 .
Although for the first two there are simple Euclidean geodesic flows in R3 along
the vertical lines, these are not the Lorentzian geodesic flow lines.

the geodesic flow curves not intersecting.

For the third, M3 is obtained from M2 by a combination of the homothety of
multiplication by 25 combined with the translation by (0, 0, 3.2). Hence, for the

By the circular symmetry of each surface about the z-axis, we may view the
Lorentzian geodesics in a vertical plane through the z-axis. We may compute both
the level sets of the Lorentzian geodesic flow and the corresponding geodesics using
Proposition 8.1 and solving the systems of equations (7.2). We show the results
of the computations using the software Maple in Figures 7 and 8. The Lorentzian
geodesic flow between M1 and M3 with the vertical correspondence is nonsingular,
as shown by the level sets and geodesic curves in Figure 7. By comparison, the
Lorentzian geodesic flow between M2 and M3 for the vertical correspondence is
singular. We see the cusp formation in the level sets in Figure 8 a). The singularities
result from the intersection of the geodesics seen in and the individual flow curves
in b). We also see that the increased bending of the geodesics versus those in
Figure 7 result from the increases in the changes in tangent directions, leading to
the formation of cusp singularities. By contrast, for the second correspondence
resulting from the action of the element of the extended Poincare group, geodesics
are straight lines as shown in Figure 9 and the flow is nonsingular.

Figure 9. Lorentzian geodesic flow between M2 and M3 in a
vertical plane through the z-axis for the correspondence arising
from the action of an element of the extended Poincare group given
by a homothety combined with a translation. The geodesics are
straight lines and the flow is nonsingular.

Remark 10.2. For the surfaces, the flows are obtained by rotating the planar
figures in Figures 7, 8 and 9. The rotation of Figure 8 yields a circular cusp edge
which evolves from a single point on the axis of symmetry. Hence, the creation
point for the cusp singularities does not have generic form.
