We study the analytic properties of the ’t Hooft coupling expansion of the beta-function at the
leading nontrivial large-Nf order for QED, QCD, Super QED and Super QCD. For each theory,
the ’t Hooft coupling expansion is convergent. We discover that an analysis of the expansion
coefficients to roughly 30 orders is required to establish the radius of convergence accurately, and
to characterize the (logarithmic) nature of the first singularity. We study summations of the betafunction expansion at order 1/Nf and identify the physical origin of the singularities in terms of
iterated bubble diagrams. We find a common analytic structure across these theories, with important
technical differences between supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric theories. We also discuss the
expected structure at higher orders in the 1/Nf expansion, which will be in the future accessible with
the methods presented in this work, meaning without the need for resumming the perturbative series.
Understanding the structure of the large-Nf expansion is an essential step towards determining the
ultraviolet fate of asymptotically non-free gauge theories.

INTRODUCTION

The discovery of four dimensional asymptotically safe
quantum field theories [1] has spurred recent phenomenological and theoretical interest. The original result made
use of the Veneziano limit, in which one considers a large
number of both colors and flavors. These theories feature perturbative safety and contain not only gauge and
fermion degrees of freedom but also scalars. It is therefore theoretically and phenomenologically important to
investigate the ultraviolet fate of non-asymptotically free
gauge theories featuring a small number of colors but
still a large number of flavors. In particular, one wishes
to either exclude or demonstrate that a large number
of flavors can lead to an asymptotically safe scenario in
gauge-fermion theories.
This quest has revitalized the study of quantum field
theories at a large number of flavors Nf . The timeliness of our investigation is further corroborated by the
fact that the large Nf non-asymptotically free regime of
gauge-fermion theories is being, for the first time, investigated via first principle lattice simulations where we
expect the first results to appear soon [2].
An intriguing property of this limit is that, at each
order in the 1/Nf expansion, only a finite number of underlying topologies contributes, where each gauge line is
dressed with matter loops. Correspondingly, at fixed order in 1/Nf the number of diagrams grows polynomially
with the loop order, suggesting that a closed form resummed result with a finite radius of convergence may
be achievable.
The first notable study is large-Nf Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) [3], while large-Nf Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) was considered later in [4]. A historical summary of the techniques and earlier results can be
found in [5, 6]. The generalization to a wide class of semisimple gauge-Yukawa theories appeared only recently in

[7–12]. For gauge theories with different fermion matter representations the new phase diagram as a function
of the number of flavours and colors was put forward
in [13, 14], and it was termed Conformal Window 2.0,
extending and generalizing the original phase diagram of
[15, 16] to contain, besides an infrared conformal window,
also an ultraviolet (safe) one.
In the limit of a large number of matter fields, it is
natural to introduce the ’t Hooft coupling

with the gauge coupling g and the Dynkin index S2 (R),

where each β (k) (K) has itself a perturbative expansion
in the ’t Hooft coupling K. Similar expansions hold for
anomalous dimensions and other critical quantities.
Asymptotic freedom is lost for theories at finite number of colors and large number of flavors, and therefore
such theories can only be fundamental if they develop an
interacting fixed point in the ultraviolet. This cannot occur in perturbation theory without Yukawa interactions
[1, 17], but it may occur non-perturbatively above a critical number of flavors [9]. To see how this might work,
let us schematically consider the leading nontrivial order

LARGE Nf QED

QED is structurally the simplest gauge theory, but it
still has a rich perturbative and non-perturbative structure, which we probe here in the large Nf limit. The
QED beta-function has been computed in [3] at the leading non-trivial order in the 1/Nf expansion:

β (1)

At this order the function β (1) (K)/K 2 must develop a
singular behavior for the beta-function to develop a zero
as Nf → ∞. This indeed happens for QED and QCD,
as summarized in [5, 9, 14].
In this paper we investigate this phenomenon further
and make a systematic study of the analytic structure
of the ’t Hooft coupling expansion of the leading largeNf beta-function for QED, QCD, Super QED (SQED)
and Super QCD (SQCD). We discover that for each theory the ’t Hooft coupling expansion is convergent, but
a large number of expansion coefficients are needed in
order to determine accurately the radius of convergence
and to extract the logarithmic nature of the first singularity of the theory. Additionally, by a detailed investigation of the summation properties of the beta-function
at leading order of 1/Nf , we identify the physical origin of the singularities from the iterated self-energy diagrams. We find a universal analytic structure across
the theories investigated here, while being able to resolve
important physical differences between supersymmetric
and non-supersymmetric theories.
The paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II, we investigate large-Nf QED and introduce the relevant mathematical tests and tools that we use for the various theories. These include the asymptotic analysis of the expansion coefficients and Padé approximants. We then identify the physical origin of the poles. We extend this analysis to QCD, SQED, and SQCD in Sec.III. There we also
elucidate and highlight the crucial differences among the
various theories. We present our conclusions in Sec. IV.
In App. A, we briefly review Darboux’s theorem, relevant
for the large-order behavior of the expansion coefficients,
and in App. B, we describe on a technical level how we
extracted the numerical coefficients of the beta-function.

In the coefficients cn we recognize characteristic π powers and zeta values, familiar from algebraic properties
of Feynman perturbation theory and harmonic polylogarithms [18, 19].
Before discussing the analytic structure of the integral representation in (4), consider the following pragmatic question: suppose, as is often the case, one were
given only a finite number of terms of the expansion
in (6), what could we learn about the physical nature
of the expansion? There is a well-developed formalism
to address such a question [20, 21]. The first observation is that the expansion is convergent. This can be
confirmed by a variety of simple ratio tests: for exam(1)
ple, the radius of convergence c∗ can be deduced from
(1)
(1) −1/n
the limit c∗ = limn→∞ |cn |
, or from the limit
(1)
(1) (1)
1/c∗ = limn→∞ |cn /cn−1 |. However, more information about the physics of the expansion can be obtained
by applying Darboux’s theorem [20–22], which relates
the rate of growth of the perturbative expansion coefficients to the behavior of the expansion about the leading
and subleading singularities. Note that this is a stronger
statement than simply saying that the location of the
nearest singularity determines the radius of convergence.
The expansion coefficients also encode further information about the nature of the singularity. The general

argument is summarized in App. A.

Asymptotic Analysis of Expansion Coefficients

Our goal in this section is to deduce physical informa(1)
tion from a finite number of expansion coefficients cn in
(6). We studied these coefficients up to order M = 60,
and from 60 terms we obtain a great deal of asymptotic
information. Using Richardson extrapolation [23] with
these 60 coefficients, we learn that as n → ∞

R1 = − 70π2 , and R2 = 336π2 , identifications that can be
confirmed to higher precision using higher-order Richardson extrapolations. We explain the origin of these coefficients below in (12).
Thus, using Darboux’s theorem (see App. A), from
these 60 perturbative expansion coefficients we learn
that: (i) the radius of convergence is 15/2; (ii) the lead(1)
ing singularity of βQED (K) at K∗ = 15/2 is a logarith2

mic branch point, with coefficient 21 R0 K 2 = 14K
45π 2 ; (iii)
there are no higher-order corrections associated with this
singularity; (iv) there are higher-order corrections asso27
ciated with further singularities at K = 21
2 , and K = 2 .
Interestingly, we need approximately M = 30 terms of
the expansion to be able to deduce precise information
about the leading singularity. With fewer than M = 30
terms, even identifying the radius of convergence to be
15/2 is noisy, see Fig.2. To extract accurately the second
and third singularities, and their coefficients, we require
M ≈ 40 and M ≈ 50, respectively.
Thus, the leading behavior of the 1/Nf correction to
the beta-function as K approaches the radius of convergence is

This physical information has been deduced from a finite number of terms in the perturbative expansion of

Recall that the poles in (12) are simple poles of the integrand of the beta-function in (4). After integration over

the beta-function, which were found above [see, e.g., (8)]
by a numerical Darboux analysis of the coefficients of
the perturbative expansion of the beta-function to finite

Padé Approximations

Padé approximation is a commonly used method for
studying perturbative expansions in physical systems
[23, 24]. Given the integrand FQED (x) in (5) expressed
in terms of gamma functions, there is a unique analytic
continuation beyond its radius of convergence. However,
if we only had a finite number of terms of the expansion,
not its full analytic form, we could still probe beyond the
radius of convergence using Padé approximation.
Padé approximants construct analytic continuations of
truncated Taylor series (i.e., polynomial) approximations
to functions, expressing the given polynomial as a ratio of
two polynomials of lower order, with coefficients determined purely algorithmically. Padé approximants thus
convert a polynomial to a rational function, which can
also be expressed as a partial fraction expansion, whose
residues and poles are determined by the coefficients of
the original truncated Taylor series. This means that
Padé approximants tend to be quite good at representing function with poles, while they are less good at representing functions with branch cuts [23, 24].

is algorithmic, leading to a ratio of two polynomials
PR (x) and QS (x), of order R and S respectively, where
R + S = M . It is in fact a built-in function in symbolic
mathematics languages such as Maple or Mathematica.
We took up to 60 terms of the expansion about x = 0
of the integrand FQED (x), and converted it to a diagonal Padé approximant P [M/2,M/2] (x), for various values of M . In Fig. 3 we display the function FQED (x)
together with the diagonal Padé approximants starting
from M = 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 coefficients. With M = 20
coefficients we do not even ”see” the first pole. With
M = 30 coefficients we accurately probe the first pole,
but not the second pole. For the second pole we need
approximately M = 40 coefficients, while with M = 50
coefficients we accurately resolve the third pole. These
numbers are consistent with the number of coefficients
required in the ratio test and asymptotic analysis of the
beta-function coefficients in Sec. II A, to resolve the logarithmic singularities of β (1) (K).

approximant P [M/2,M/2] for M terms in the perturbative expansion in (13). Progressively more poles are resolved as the
order of the Padé approximant is increased.

In fact, a full Padé analysis constructs the “Padé
table”, of all Padé approximants P [R,S] (x), with R +
S = M . It turns out that certain off-diagonal approximants are even better at representing the integrand function FQED (x). This can be understood from
the analytic representation of the integrand in (11).
Given that trigonometric and gamma functions have

representations, we see that

the Γ 1 + x3 /Γ 12 + x3 factor in (11) is naturally represented as a near-diagonal

extra trigonometric factor in the numerator. Thus a Padé
representation whose numerator is a higher-order polynomial than the denominator polynomial will represent the
analytic structure of the actual function FQED (x) more
accurately. We have confirmed that this is the case, starting from the 60 expansion coefficients, but we note that
the simple diagonal Padé representations shown in Fig. 3
are already remarkably precise.

Physical Origin of the Poles

We have seen that the finite radius of convergence,
K∗ = 15
2 , of the expansion of the 1/Nf beta-function
(1)
βQED (K) can be traced directly to the leading pole of the

Γ 52 − x3 factor in the integrand function FQED (x). This
gamma factor arises because it enters the leading 1/Nf
computation via iteration of the basic building block of
the one-bubble self-energy diagram, whose amplitude Π0
is given by


Γ2 2 − 2 Γ 2

regularized in d = 4 − . In the resummation, this amplitude typically enters the full beta-function as its inverse,

5
1/Π0 , and its argument is rescaled with the value of the
1/-pole1 [6].
For the QED computation, the value of the 1/-pole in
(14) is 32 . Consequently, we expect the resummed 1/Nf
beta-function to contain the factor

iii) No further singularities emerge, or a new singular
structure appears further away from the leadingorder one. This would be an indication that the
putative fixed point in (9) is indeed physical. For
example, the leading isolated pole, like the one that
we will see appearing in QCD in the next section,
is a candidate for this scenario since it is not due
to the fermion self-energy amplitude.

Indeed, this factor appears in the integrand function
FQED (x), and governs the pole structure underlying the
asymptotics of the perturbative expansion coefficients,
and the structure of the Padé approximations to the integrand function FQED (x).
Knowing this, one
 can devise improved expansions in
2
which this Π−1
x
factor is factored out, with only the
0
3
remaining factors needing to be analyzed. Not surprisingly, this leads to noticeable improvement of the resulting Padé approximations, and a much faster approach to
the asymptotic behavior of the expansion coefficients.
The general idea of using Padé approximants to study
the behavior of beta-functions is significant for analyzing higher orders in the 1/Nf expansion, for which no
closed-form resummation formula is currently known. In
particular, these methods may allow us to access the
leading-order pole structure at higher orders in the 1/Nf
expansion, if enough coefficients can be extracted from
the relevant diagrams. This information has quantitative
implications for the stability, size, and structure of the
asymptotically safe conformal window. One can imagine
the following possible scenarios at higher orders in the
1/Nf expansion:

Of course, even the ultimate confirmation of a nonperturbative zero in a generic beta-function away from
the origin, is typically insufficient to establish the existence of a physical conformal field theory. Other critical quantities such as the variation of the a-function
or anomalous dimensions can potentially violate physical bounds [13, 25].

The beta-function at order 1/Nf for an SU (Nc ) gauge
theory was first calculated in [4], and written in a closed
integral form in [5]. The result is:

i) A new singular structure may emerge closer to the
origin, de facto, disconnecting the putative fixed
point in (9) from the Gaußian fixed point at the
origin. The detailed structure of the new singularity would determine whether or not the theory
remains UV safe to this order. Alternatively if the
radius of convergence of the series keeps shrinking
as the order in 1/Nf increases, the UV fixed point
could eventually disappear.

ii) The current singular structure, and its location,
could be further reinforced by higher-order corrections. This possibility is partially supported by the
fact that the fermion self-energy amplitude is responsible for the singular structure of the theory.
The order of the pole in the integrand might become stronger because n bubble chains appear in
diagrams at the order O(1/Nfn ). In this case the
ultimate UV fate of the theory will depend on the
character, sign, and strength of the reinforced singular structure.

where d(G), d(R) are the dimensions of the group G
and the representation R, and similarly for the quadratic
Casimirs C2 . This result is very similar to that for QED
and agrees with it in the Abelian limit C2 (G) → 0 and
d(G)/d(R) → 1. The gamma factor Γ 25 − x3 produces
the same pole pattern as in QED. However, a new isolated simple pole appears at x∗ = 3, leading to a smaller
radius of convergence, K∗ = 3. This effect is purely due
to the non-Abelian nature of the theory, as can be seen
also from its residue:

Since the leading singularity for QCD is closer to the origin than for QED, fewer perturbative orders are required
to resolve it using an asymptotic or Padé analysis. For
example, for Nc = 3 and with fermions in the fundamental representation, the leading residue can be extracted
with O(10−3 ) accuracy from the asymptotic expansion
of the coefficients already at ∼14th order. Retaining up
to 15th order in the expansion of the integrand, the Padé
approximant P [7,7] (x) gives a good reconstruction of the
integrand within the radius of convergence. A similar
analysis can be carried out for the other poles in the integrand: the results for the theories considered here are
summarized in Fig. 4. Note that our result for QED is
compatible with [26] where an expansion up to the 24th
order was not sufficient to find a stable zero in the betafunction.
Our results across the various theories indicate that
the main factor determining the number of coefficients
needed to resolve a given pole is the distance of the latter to the origin2 . As discussed in the end of Sec. II C,
the behavior near the leading pole is associated with the
amplitude factor Π−1
0 , so we expect a similar relation between the number of coefficients and the location of the
poles at the next orders in the 1/Nf expansion. Furthermore, since no closed form re-summed perturbative
expressions are known at higher order in 1/Nf , this motivates the importance of a similar Padé analysis of the
perturbative series at 1/Nf2 .

Notice again that the integrand expression for QCD in
(17) agrees with the one for QED in (5) the Abelian limit.
For each of the SUSY beta-functions in (21) and (22), the
integrand function F (x) has its first singularity as a simple pole at x = 3 with a negative residue3 , see Tab. 1.
For example, this opposite sign explains the different behavior of the beta-function near the first singularity, as
shown in Fig. 1 for QED and SQED. Due to this negative
sign for SQED and SQCD, the associated logarithmic singularity of the beta-function cannot provide a cancellation between the first two orders in the large-Nf expansion (3), and therefore no non-perturbative fixed point
arises.

In our convention the coupling K is twice the coupling defined
in the original works, where the pole appeared at x = 3/2.

It is interesting to note that this conclusion holds also
in the NSVZ scheme, which can be related to DRED in
by an order-by-order coupling redefinition [29], see also
[30] for details on such a relation. The well known NSVZ

We dropped the NSVZ label, as this quantity is scheme
independent at the alleged fixed point. In the limit
Nf  Nc , the theory has lost asymptotic freedom and
therefore such a fixed point has to develop in the UV.
However due to the violation of the a-theorem [25, 32, 33]
it is disconnected from the IR Gaußian fixed point. The
absence of an UV fixed point smoothly connected to
the origin agrees with the large-Nf result in the DRED
scheme, where, in fact, no UV fixed point is seen to complete the Gaußian.

CONCLUSIONS

Our analysis of the convergence properties of the leading 1/Nf behavior of QED, QCD and their supersymmetric cousins has revealed several interesting features.
We observe the emergence of a common analytic structure stemming from the leading 1/Nf corrections, with
the important difference that the coefficient of the logarithmic branch singularity is positive for QED and QCD,
but it switches sign for their supersymmetric counterparts. The sign plays a crucial rôle when considering
the UV fate of these theories. For example for the supersymmetric case it implies that the theories are not
fundamental, in agreement with other non-perturbative
analyses.
We have demonstrated, by direct comparison with the
full result, that the analysis of the large-order behavior of

the ’t Hooft coupling expansion is able to identify the location and nature of the leading logarithmic singularities,
including the overall sign and magnitude of their coefficients. This suggests that a large-order analysis can be
used in the near future to tackle the next-to-leading order
in the 1/Nf expansion, in the absence of a closed-form
result. These corrections are crucial to test the singular structure of the leading 1/Nf result, with important
consequences for the UV fate of these theories.

Appendix A: Darboux’s Theorem and Large-order
Behavior of Expansion Coefficients

Darboux’s theorem says that for a convergent series
expansion, the behavior of the expansion in the vicinity
of a nearby singularity is determined by the large-order
growth of the expansion coefficients about another point
(say z = 0) [20–22]. For example, suppose a function f (z)
has the following expansion in the vicinity of a point z0 :

−p
z
f (z) ∼ φ(z) 1 −
+ ψ(z) ,
z → z0 , (A1)
z0
where φ(z) and ψ(z) are analytic near z0 . Then the Taylor expansion coefficients of f (z) near the origin have
large-order growth

This argument can be run in reverse, so that an analysis
of the large-order behavior of the coefficients bn enables
us first to determine the radius of convergence z0 , and
then also the nature p of the singularity; for example, a
pole, or a branch-cut, and what type of branch-cut. The
overall factor determines φ(z0 ), and further sub-leading
information determines higher orders of the expansion of
φ(z) about z0 . If the singularity is logarithmic,

The O(1/Nf ) beta functions discussed in this work are
known in their resummed form, so we can re-expand them
to 60 orders and perform a Padé analysis. The motivation for this is to obtain an estimate of how many perturbative terms are required in order to identify both
the location and nature of the leading singularity, with
a view towards a direct perturbative computation of the
O(1/Nf2 ) beta functions, for which no resummed version
is currently known. It is not a priori clear whether one
might need 10 terms, or several hundred. Our work has
shown that at O(1/Nf ) roughly 30-40 perturbative terms
are required, due to the lower order oscillatory behavior,
which we have associated with the appearance of the amplitude factor in (14). Since these factors appear also in
an O(1/Nf2 ) computation, we expect that at least the
same number of perturbative coefficients would be necessary in such a computation at a given higher order in
the 1/Nf expansion. We now comment briefly on the
steps required to make such a computation feasible at
higher orders in the 1/Nf expansion. To this end, we
first describe how the O(1/Nf ) perturbative expansion
is obtained in the diagrammatic approach.
The diagrams that contribute to the beta function at

the order 1/Nf in QED and QCD are displayed, e.g.,
in [9]. For the contraction of the diagrams one can use
the Mathematica package FeynCalc [34], which performs
the trace over Lorentz and Dirac indices in d dimensions. Complicated diagrams can be traced with the
symbolic manipulation system FORM [35, 36], as well
as the Mathematica package FormTracer [37]. The contracted diagrams can be evaluated with standard multiloop techniques along the lines of [38–41]. The diagrams
contain fully dressed gauge propagators and thus one has
to apply reduction formulas that only hit non-dressed
propagators.
This procedure can be extended to higher orders in
the 1/Nf expansion, to determine the perturbative coefficients up to arbitrary order in the coupling but subleading in 1/Nf . At higher order in 1/Nf , the loop-order
and the number of dressed propagators increases. Thus,
at higher order in 1/Nf , we expect that more efficient
reduction formulae will be required.
Another complication at higher order in 1/Nf is that
at any order the integrated diagrams contain gamma and
hypergeometric functions, which need to be expanded in
 = d−4. For the n-th loop coefficient we need to expand
these functions up to n−1 . These expansions are slow,
and at higher order in 1/Nf there will be more such factors to expand. Analytic expansions are only known for
specific cases or only to low order. Thus in our O(1/Nf )
computation, we used numerical expansion methods, in
particular the package NumExp [42]. This numerical precision will need to be balanced with the precision required
for the subsequent Padé analysis.
