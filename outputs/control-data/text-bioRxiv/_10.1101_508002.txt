Abstract

12

Biodiversity can be represented by different dimensions. While many diversity

13

metrics try to capture the variation of these dimensions they also lead to a

14

‘fragmentation’ of the concept of biodiversity itself. Developing a unified measure

15

that integrates all the dimensions of biodiversity is a theoretical solution for this

16

problem, however, it remains operationally impossible. Alternatively, understanding

17

which dimensions better represent the biodiversity of a set of communities can be a

18

reliable way to integrate the different diversity metrics. Therefore, to achieve a

19

holistic understand of biological diversity, we explore the concept of dimensionality.

20

We define dimensionality of diversity as the number of complementary components

21

of biodiversity, represented by diversity metrics, needed to describe biodiversity in an

22

unambiguously and effective way. We provide a solution that joins two components

23

of dimensionality — correlation and the variation — operationalized through two

24

metrics, respectively: Evenness of Eigenvalues (EE) and Importance Values (IV).

25

Through simulation we show that considering EE and IV together can provide

26

information that is neglected when only EE is considered. We demonstrate how to

27

apply this framework by investigating the dimensionality of South American small

28

mammal communities. Our example evidenced that, for some representations of

29

biological diversity, more attention is needed in the choice of diversity metrics

30

necessary to effectively characterize biodiversity. We conclude by highlighting that

31

this integrated framework provides a better understanding of dimensionality than

32

considering only the correlation component.

Introduction

36

Biodiversity encompasses all variation present in life, from genetic material to

37

populations, communities and higher levels of biological organization like entire

38

ecosystems (Wilson 1997). In addition to its broadness in scale and complexity, the

39

central position of the concept of biodiversity in ecological studies justifies efforts to

40

develop measures that properly operationalize the concept. These efforts are reflected

41

in the immensurable number of diversity metrics that have appeared as attempts to

42

encompass all the variation in biodiversity. However, although these diversity metrics

43

allow the description of different dimensions, as the number of them increases the

44

concept of biodiversity becomes operationalized in disparate ways that convey no

45

precise information. This lack of consensus in operationalization of the concept of

46

biodiversity led Hulrbert (1971) to propose the idea of the non-concept of species

47

diversity, in which he advocated that the many metrics of biodiversity be summarized

48

in only a few relevant ones that can be used to express adequately and unambiguously

49

the concept of biodiversity.

50

Long since Hulrbert´s seminal work, there has been a pronounced increase in

51

the number of metrics that quantify characteristics of biological diversity other than

52

the traditional taxonomic-based metrics, revealing that patterns of diversity for some

53

communities can be best described using other components of biological diversity,

54

such as functional and phylogenetic components (Graham and Fine 2008, Cisneros et

55

al. 2014). However, these findings are not consensual (e.g Lamb et al. 2009), since

56

some phylogenetic and functional metrics can be strongly correlated with traditional

57

metrics (Tucker and Cadotte 2013, Tucker et al. 2018), deepening the question of

58

which metrics represent the fundamental components of biological diversity

59

(Hulrbert, 1971). A theoretical approach to searching for fundamental variation in

60

biodiversity is to integrate the many sources of information in a unique framework.

61

This integration can be achieved by investigating the relationships among existing

62

metrics. A previous work that proposed this integration based it on quantifying a

63

characteristic of biodiversity known as dimensionality (Stevens and Tello 2014).

64

Dimensionality can be defined, at the community scale of biological

65

organization, as the amount of information needed to effectively characterize the

66

variation presented in a given biodiversity representation, by means of diversity

67

metrics. Communities with high dimensionality require more dimensions to be

68

effectively described than communities with low dimensionality (Stevens and Tello

69

2014). Quantifying the dimensionality of biodiversity currently involves searching for

70

the degree of complementarity in spatial or temporal variation among multiple metrics

71

of diversity, which is obtained mainly through a measure denominated Eveness of

72

Eigenvalues (hereafter EE) (Stevens and Tello 2014).

73

Stevens and Tello´s EE metric is obtained by Principal Component Analysis

74

(PCA) of a matrix of diversity metrics (hereafter matrix M, sensu Ricotta 2005) for a

75

set of communities, and calculating an evenness metric for the eigenvalues of the axes

76

that represent this fundamental biodiversity space. The logic behind EE is that, if the

77

diversity metrics used to characterize communities have low complementarity, almost

78

all of the fundamental variation in biodiversity will be concentered in a few axes,

79

producing a low EE. On the other hand, if diversity metrics are completely

80

complementary with each other (variation in biodiversity will be equally distributed

81

among axes) the EE of the communities will be 1.

82

The EE metric represents, in a simple way, the degree of complementarity

83

among the dimensions of biodiversity represented by diversity metrics, which

84

comprises what we call here the correlation component of dimensionality (see also

85

Tucker and Cadotte 2013, Lamb et al. 2006 for uses of correlation component).

86

However, EE ignores another source of information in dimensionality — the amount

87

of variation, or importance, that each diversity metric presents in fundamental

88

biodiversity space. This comprises what we call here the variation component of

89

dimensionality.

90

Suppose a situation in which diversity metrics are highly correlated (Figure 1

91

A) and each metric accounts for a similar amount of variation in fundamental

92

biodiversity space (Figure 1B). This situation has low complementarity among

93

dimensions of biodiversity and high redundancy in the amount of variation that each

94

metric captures in fundamental biodiversity space (represented as the length of the

95

arrows in 1B). Consequently, we could rely on any of these diversity metrics to

96

effectively represent the variation in biodiversity of these communities. On the other

97

hand, communities with low complementarity may present a situation in which one of

98

the metrics captures almost all the variation in the fundamental biodiversity space

99

(Metric 2 in Figure 1C), indicating low redundancy of metrics. Following the current

100

approach to measuring dimensionality, EE would indicate similar patterns of

101

dimensionality for communities in 1B and 1C. However, the choice of metric in 1C is

102

of greater importance than in 1B, in which the metrics are highly redundant regarding

103

the information captured. Therefore, considering only the correlation component does

104

not provide enough evidence to support the decision of which diversity metrics to use

105

to effectively characterize biological diversity for two communities with similar EE,

106

because it disregards the variation component inherent to dimensionality.

107

Finding a measure that captures the variation component of dimensionality is

108

not an impediment for effectively characterizing dimensionality, since it can be

109

operationalized by the metric Importance Values (hereafter IV) proposed by Wilsey et

110

al. (2005). However, since the common way to quantify dimensionality (Stevens and

111

Tello 2014) is limited to capturing only the correlation component, the development

112

of a unified framework that combines both correlation and variation components

113

would provide a way to better represent the dimensionality of biodiversity.

114

Therefore, our aim was to update the concept of dimensionality of biodiversity

115

and its operationalization by integrating the correlation and variation components

116

through EE and IV in a framework for quantification of dimensionality. To do this we

117

show, through simulation, how EE and IV together can distinguish situations with

118

different degrees of complementarity of dimensions of diversity and redundancy of

119

information that each metric captures. We then present an empirical example of the

120

investigation of dimensionality by applying the integrated framework to communities

121

of small mammals (cricetids and marsupials). Specifically, we evaluated the level of

122

complementarity and redundancy for different sets of diversity metrics used to

123

describe the biodiversity of cricetids and marsupials, highlighting how the proposed

124

dimensionality framework facilitates the first step of biological assessment — the

125

choice of metrics to be used for characterizing biodiversity.

Material and Methods

128

Investigating the dimensionality of biodiversity: obtaining EE and IV

129

Our framework for investigating the dimensionality of biodiversity comprises

130

three steps. The first step is to calculate matrix M, which, for the sake of simplicity,

131

will contain three metrics of diversity for the simulation analysis: a measure of

132

functional diversity (FD [Petchey & Gaston 2006)]), a measure of phylogenetic

133

diversity (PD [Faith 1992]) and richness. We chose a simplistic approach with only

134

three metrics since our objective with the simulation analysis was to focus on showing

135

how IV can reveal patterns that are not detected by using only EE. We were more

136

interested in the patterns of correlation and variation of diversity metrics in

137

biodiversity space than the particularity of the metrics themselves. We present a more

138

realistic exploration of the integrated framework in the section Assessing the

139

dimensionality of biodiversity in small mammal communities.

140

The second step involves performing a PCA of matrix M using a standardized

141

correlation matrix. As will be shown next, the standardization method applied to

142

matrix M prior to the PCA must differ between the calculation of EE and IV.

143

The third step is to calculate the dimensionality metrics EE and IV. We

144

calculate EE using Camargo´s evenness index in Equation 1, following the original

145

proposition of Stevens and Tello (2014):

Equation 1

147

Camargo’s evenness index (Camargo 1993) is calculated using the axes (A) and their

148

respective eigenvalues (eih and ejh) from a PCA of the standardized matrix M, in

149

which the metrics were scaled to have a mean of zero and equal variances. The higher

150

the value of EE, the higher the complementarity the communities have in relation to

151

the dimensions of biodiversity represented in matrix M. On the other hand, lower EE

152

values indicate lower complementarity in the dimensions used to characterize the

153

communities. IV is calculated according to the method proposed by Wilsey et al.

154

(2005), using a matrix (M) standardized by the maximum values of each diversity

155

metric. This standardization removes the effect that the different units of each

156

diversity metric have, without modifying their original variation. To obtain IV for

157

each diversity metric in matrix M we apply Equation 2, in which IVi represents the IV

158

of diversity metric i, r2ij is the squared correlation of diversity metric i with PCj, and

R2j is the amount of variation that PCj accounts for in ordination space (biodiversity

space).

Equation 2

PC varies from 1 to j and corresponds to the number of significant

163

eigenvectors in the PCA, evaluated by the Kaiser-Gutmann criterion. The greater the

164

IV the more variation the diversity metric accounts for in biodiversity space. IV

165

approaches 1 when the diversity metric accounts for almost all the variation and

166

approaches zero when the metric accounts for little variation. Sets of communities

167

with highly uneven IV values for diversity metrics possess low redundancy in metric

168

importance, while communities with highly even IV values possess high redundancy

169

regarding the amount of information captured by each metric.

170

Testing the assessment of the dimensionality of diversity using EE and IV

171

To assess the effectiveness of EE and IV in acquiring information regarding

172

correlation and variation of dimensionality in matrix M, the following conditions

173

must be met: (1) EE values must not differ for set of communites simulated in

174

scenarios with the same level of correlation among diversity metrics, and must differ

175

among communities that have different levels of correlation among diversity metrics;

176

(2) for scenarios with low and high correlation, IV must be similar among metrics that

177

have similar variation in biodiversity space (e.g. Figure 1B), and differ for scenarios

178

in which variation in biodiversity space is mainly due to a single metric (e.g. situation

179

represented Figure 1C, Metric 2 must have a higher IV than Metric 1). We evaluate

180

whether EE and IV can recover these patterns by simulating communities with

181

varying degrees of correlation and variation for each metric in biodiversity space

182

obtained from matrix M.

183

The simulations were based on a pattern-oriented procedure, producing

184

diversity metrics with patterns of correlation and variation that represent four

185

scenarios with the following characteristics: In the HiC/EqV (High Correlation and

186

Equal Variation) scenario the diversity metrics are highly correlated and have similar

187

variation in biodiversity space. The HiC/DifV (High Correlation and Different

188

Variation) scenario has diversity metrics that are highly correlated and vary in

189

importance of each metric in biodiversity space. The LoC/EqV (Low Correlation and

190

Equal Variation) scenario has diversity metrics with low correlation and similar

191

importance in biodiversity space. Finally, the LoC/DifV (Low Correlation and

192

Different Variation) scenario has diversity metrics with low correlation and dissimilar

193

importance in biodiversity space.

194

We generate scenarios HiC/EqV and HiC/DifV by starting with a phylogeny

195

that was simulated by a birth-death processes (function sim.bdtree from the package

196

geiger [Harmon, Weir, Brock, Glor, & Challenger, 2008]) where a species, chosen

197

randomly, initiates the procedure by colonizing a given community. Subsequent

198

addition of species to the community depends on the species that are already present

199

in that community. Communities at one extreme will only contain species that are

200

phylogenetically closely related to each other (top 10%), with the phylogenetic filter

201

becoming less restrictive until communities do not have any phylogenetic filter that

202

restricts coexistence of species (least restrictive condition). Since we simulated a

203

continuous trait that was conserved over the phylogenetic tree — evolved according

204

to a Brownian motion model, using the function rTraitCont (Paradis et al. 2004) with

205

the ρ [rho] parameter set to 3 — with the number of species in each community

206

gradually increasing (less phylogenetic filter, more species), the procedure created a

207

gradient of phylogenetic, functional and taxonomic diversity metrics. In order to

208

generate differences in variation of the diversity metrics, in scenario HiC/ DifV we

209

simulated a trait that evolves according to a regime of stabilizing selection (Ornstein-

210

Uhlebeck model with the strength of selection set by the parameter α at 0.8) that

211

restricts trait variation to within an optimal range (represented by a θ [theta] of 0).

212

This allowed us to generate a set of communities in which the diversity metrics were

213

highly correlated but variation of FD was much lower than that of richness and PD

214

since the traits that were used in the calculation of FD were restricted by the selection

215

process.

216

We generated the scenario LoC/DifV by following the same procedures

217

described above for scenario HiC/EqV, however, the trait was simulated to have low

218

phylogenetic signal and the phylogenetic tree used to calculate PD was modified to

219

simulate a process of evolution in which most speciation occurs near the root (a star-

220

like phylogeny). This procedure resulted in low correlation between PD and FD, since

221

the relationship between phylogeny and traits was disrupted. Additionally, low

222

variability for PD and richness metrics was obtained since we set the simulations to

223

produce communities with the same number of species but with the phylogenetic

224

filtering acting in community assembly. Consequently, most of the variation in this

225

scenario is due to the FD metric. Finally, to generate scenario LoC/EqV we simulated

226

communities in which all species in the phylogenetic tree had an equal probability of

227

occurring in any community (no phylogenetic filtering acting on the assembly), and

228

set the richness to be very similar for all communities. This procedure generated

229

metacommunities with low correlation and similar amounts of variation for all

230

diversity metrics.

231
232

We generated 999 sets of communities for each scenario described above,
with the metacommunities of all scenarios being composed of 50 communities with a

233

minimum of 20 and a maximum of 200 species. The phylogenetic filter was set to act

234

gradually on the communities, increasing by the order of 10% (start by selecting the

235

top 10% most phylogenetically similar species, followed by the top 20% and so on

236

until 90% of the species have been selected from the pool). Details and an illustration

237

of the simulation procedures and scenarios are presented in the supplementary

238

material Appendix S1, along with a link to an interactive module that we produced to

239

illustrate the simulation procedure used in this work.

240

Finally, we tested whether the values of EE and IV met our theoretical

241

expectations. We checked if EE values differed between scenarios with low

242

correlation and scenarios with high correlation (scenarios HiC/DifV and HiC/EqV

243

versus scenarios LoC/EqV and LoC/DifV). To effectively capture the correlation

244

component of dimensionality EE must be higher in scenarios with low correlation

245

among diversity metrics than in scenarios with high correlation. To test for

246

differences among IV values of each metric in the scenarios we used a graphical tool

247

called profile of importance (Wilsey et al. 2005) and quantified differences in IV of

248

each metric by calculating F values obtained from a linear model (Equation 3). F

249

values allow the IV values of the three dimensions (PD, FD and richness) to be

250

compared and to determine if the IV values of the DifV scenarios (scenarios

251

HiC/DifV and LoC/DifV) differed more from each than did the IV values calculated

252

for the EqV scenarios (scenarios HiC/EqV and LoC/EqV). The simulation scenarios

253

and the theoretical expectations regarding EE and IV follow the schematic

254

representation present in Figure 2.

258

throughout the South American continent. We constructed matrix M for these

259

communities by calculating eight diversity metrics that represent different dimensions

260

of taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic components of biological diversity. The

261

choice of metrics was based on the works of Tucker et al. (2017) and Scheiner (2019),

262

which together represent the most complete compilation and classification of metrics

263

of taxonomic, functional (Scheiner, 2019) and phylogenetic diversity (Tucker et al.

264

2017). We chose at least one metric for each of the richness, divergence and

265

regularity dimensions of the three components of biodiversity considered here. The

266

taxonomic component was represented by richness; the functional component by FD

267

(richness dimenson, Petchey and Gaston 2006b), FEve (regularity dimension) and

268

FDiv (divergence dimension, Villéger et al. 2008); and the phylogenetic component

269

by PD (richness dimension, Faith 1992), MNTD (divergence dimension, Webb et al.,

270

2002), PSV (divergence dimension, Helmus et al., 2007) and PEve (regularity

271

dimension, Villéger et al. 2014).

272

Traits used to calculate functional metrics comprised life-history attributes —

273

weight, head-body length, diet and form of locomotion. Species were categorized

274

according to their diet as insectivores, herbivores, granivores, omnivores, frugivores,

275

piscivores, seed predators and leaf predators, and according to their modes of

276

locomotion as terrestrial, semifossorial, semiaquatic, arboreal and scansorial. Some

277

species were allocated to more than one diet and locomotion category. All calculated

278

diversity metrics require a distance matrix or a functional dendrogram obtained from

279

a distance matrix. Therefore, to obtain the functional distance matrix we used Gower

280

distance (Pavoine et al. 2009) for traits that have different statistical characteristics

281

(numerical and categorical).

282

The phylogenetic hypothesis used to calculate phylogenetic indices was

283

obtained from the mammalian phylogenies of Bininda-Emonds et al. (2007) and

284

Fabre et al. (2012), the latter of which was used to improve the phylogenetic

285

resolution to species level. Seven species present in our data were not included in the

286

phylogeny Fabre et al. (2012), so we included these species as polytomies within their

287

respective genera. Divergence times for our phylogeny were estimated in millions of

288

years by equally distributing the ages of undated nodes, based on the know ages

289

present in Bininda-Emonds et al. (2007) and Fabre et al. (2012), using the BLADJ

290

algorithm of Phylocom software (Webb et al. 2008). The phylogenetic hypothesis and

291

the original references compiled to assemble the community data used in this work

292

are provided in Figure S2 and Table S1 of Appendix 2 of the supplementary material.

293

The metrics EE and IV were calculated as previously described, with the

294

number of axes used in IV calculation being determined by the Kaiser-Gutmann stop

295

criterion. We also compared the observed values of EE with a null distribution of 999

296

EE values generated by a null model that randomizes a species incidence matrix while

297

preserving differences in richness among sites and mixing species frequency

298

(performed with the sim3 function from the EcoSimR package [Gotelli and Ellison

299

2013a]). Using this null model we tested the null hypothesis that observed EE values

300

do not differ from expected EE values according to variation in richness. We

301

implemented a function called dimensionality to calculate EE values from matrix M.

302

The function allows the user to choose the evenness method that will be used in the

303

308

Kaiser-Gutmann stop criterion and a bootstrap procedure that re-sampled matrix M

309

999 times and recalculated IV for each metric so that we generated confidence

310

intervals for the IV value of each diversity metric. We performed all calculations with

311

a standardized matrix M (scaled to a mean of zero and unit variance for the

312

calculation of EE values and standardized by the maximum values of each metric for

313

the calculation of IV values). Bootstrapped IV values were submitted to an Ordinary

314

Least Square (OLS) linear model to test for differences in the importance of the

315

components of diversity that assemble matrix M:

predicted value of IV for the diversity metric i,  the effect of a given dimension over

explanatory variable, in order to assess differences in importance among diversity

metrics. For both models we performed a Tukey test to assess pairwise differences in

328

importance among dimensions and metrics.

The dimensionality framework was applied to four different configurations of

combination of functional metrics and richness; and a combination of functional and

332

phylogenetic metrics. We performed these analyses to show how dimensionality can

333

change depending on the components of diversity used in matrix M, and what the

334

implications of different values of EE and different similarities among metrics IV

335

(represented as Camargo´s evenness of IV metrics) are on the choice of diversity

336

metrics to be used to represent the biodiversity. For these analysis we also computed

337

EE as the mean value calculated from a bootstrap procedure equivalent to that used

338

for the IV metric, in order to generate confidence intervals.

339

Results

340

Simulated data

341

Our simulation revealed that EE and IV, when used together, acquire information

342

regarding two aspects of dimensionality: correlation among metrics and the variation

343

that each metric accounts for in biodiversity space. This complementary information

344

that IV brings to the analysis of dimensionality is evidenced in Figure 3. Thus,

345

different patterns of redundancy in information captured by the metrics can be

346

obtained for a given level of correlation, with greater differences among IV values in

347

scenarios HiC/DifV and LoC/DifV (right side of Figure 3) than in HiC/EqV and

348

LoC/EqV (left side of Figure 3).

349

The differences in EE between scenarios of high and low correlation (Figure

350

1, comparison between EE of upper and lower graphics), but not between scenarios of

351

different and equal variation (Figure 1, comparison between EE bars in the same row)

352

support our argument that this metric captures only the correlation component of

353

dimensionality.

354

The ability of IV to capture the degree of redundancy in biodiversity

355

information of the metrics was clear mainly for the HiC/DifV scenario, in which the

356

attribute used to generate communities exhibited low variation (OU model) and,

357

consequently, the FD metric presented lower IV than richness and PD metrics. It is

358

worth noting that differences among the IV of metrics was greater in scenario

359

LoC/EqV than in scenario HiC/EqV (Figure 1, lower right graphic), since it is not

360

possible to obtain high redundancy in metric information (indicated by similar IV

361

values among metrics) along with high values of complementarity (indicated by high

362

EE). High redundancy in the importance of metrics is only possible for communities

363

with low EE (low complementarity of dimensions), as demonstrated by scenario

364

HiC/EqV. The magnitude of the differences in IV among metrics for each scenario is

365

shown in Figure S3 of Appendix S3 of the supplementary material.

366

Small mammal communities

367

We obtained a moderate value for complementarity for the small mammal

368

communities, as indicated by an EE of 0.49 for matrix M calculated with all eight

369

diversity metrics. The correlation component of dimensionality, at least for the three

370

analyzed components of diversity (functional, phylogenetic and taxonomic), may be a

371

consequence of spatial gradients of species richness, as evidenced by comparing

372

observed EE with that expected by the null model distribution of EE (Figure S4 in

373

Appendix 3 of the supplementary material).

374

Only two axes of the PCA were significant according Kaiser-Guttman criterion

375

(representing 70% of all the variation in matrix M), and composed the fundamental

376

biodiversity space in which IV was calculated. Observed IV values for the eight

377

diversity metrics ranged from 0.19 for PSV (27% of all the variation in biodiversity

378

space) to 0.003 to FDiv (0.3% of all the variation in biodiversity space). Bootstrap

379

means and confidence intervals for IV for all metrics are illustrated in Figure 4

380

through the IV profile (sensu Willig and Hollander 1995), evidencing PSV as the

381

metric capturing most of the variation in biodiversity space, followed by richness.

382

The linear OLS model showed significant variation in IV among diversity metrics

383

(F-value= 3.428; p<0.05), while the Tukey test revealed that the greatest difference in

384

importance was between taxonomic and functional components of biodiversity

385

followed by the difference between phylogenetic and functional components

386

(difference between observed means of 0.092 and 0.064, respectively; Figure S5 of

387

Appendix 3). This finding highlights the importance of considering the taxonomic and

388

phylogenetic dimensions in characterizing the biodiversity of communities of

389

cricetids and marsupials.

390

Analysis of dimensionality for matrix M containing functional metrics and

391

richness had the highest complementarity (highest EE) and lowest redundancy in

392

metric importance (biodiversity representation with similar values of IV, as indicated

393

by a lower evenness of IV than obtained for other sets of metrics) (Figure 5). PSV

394

was the metric that captured the most information in matrix M containing

395

phylogenetic metrics and richness (30% of all the variation in biodiversity space) and

396

phylogenetic and functional metrics (31% of all the variation in biodiversity space), as

397

well as for matrix M containing all metrics (24% and of all the variation in

398

biodiversity space). For matrix M that considered only functional metrics and

399

richness, richness captured most of variation (47% of all the variation in biodiversity

400

space). Despite the high variability, as indicated by the confidence intervals of IV and

401

EE evenness , it is worth noting that IV evenness remains constant for different mean

402

values of EE, with the greatest IV evenness being for the set of metrics that had the

403

lowest EE value (matrix M with phylogenetic metrics and richness).

404

Discussion

405

Our results with simulated data evidence the need for a dimensionality framework

406

that integrates both EE and IV in order to effectively characterize dimensionality by

407

considering its two components —correlation and variation in biodiversity space.

17

408

Operationalizing these two components through EE and IV reveals their

409

complementarity (by means of EE) and, given some level of complementarity, the

410

degree of redundancy in information captured by the metrics used to express these

411

dimensions (through IV). Therefore, our proposed dimensionality framework

412

represents a step beyond the current approach to operationalizing dimensionality, as

413

proposed by Stevens and Tello (2014) by distinguishing the degree of redundancy in

414

information that each diversity metric captures.

415

Our integrated dimensionality framework joins other propositions in helping

416

to choose metrics for the biological characterization of communities. We are aware

417

that the main guide for choosing diversity metrics must be the objectives of the work.

418

However, regardless of the objective, it is desirable to use diversity metrics that

419

encompass complementary components of biological diversity and account for a

420

satisfactory amount of the information present in the biodiversity component being

421

investigated (Ricotta 2005b). In this respect, Saito et al. (2015) showed that

422

phylogenetic, functional and traditional taxonomic indices present complementary

423

information and should be used to adequately characterize and monitor biodiversity of

424

stream macroinvertebrate communities. Ouchi-Melo et al. (2018) performed an

425

integrated assessment to identify areas of conservation interest in the Cerrado biome,

426

and evidenced the importance of considering traditional together with functional and

427

phylogenetic metrics. Although both of these works considered the complementarity

428

component by accounting for correlation among metrics, they did not account for

429

redundancy in the amount of variation that each metric captures in biodiversity space,

430

thus facing the same problem presented by using the EE metric alone. The

431

dimensionality framework presented here, therefore, represents the most general and

432

complete framework to date for guiding researchers in their choice of metrics to be

433

used for biological assessment by considering both complementarity among

434

biological dimensions and the amount of information that metrics can capture.

435

It is worth pointing out that the dimensionality of diversity can be investigated

436

at any spatial and temporal scale, and using any configuration of matrix M. Even for

437

works that focus on only one component of biodiversity, the investigation of

438

dimensionality can be important for knowing which aspects of biodiversity are worthy

439

of being included in biological assessment. Tucker et al. (2017) identified three

440

complementary components of the phylogenetic component: richness, divergence and

441

regularity. Thus, research focused on phylogenetic diversity can address whether

442

these three components are complementary dimensions in the analyzed communities

443

and which metrics are the most important to measure in order to best represent

444

variation in these dimensions. As we showed in our empirical example with small

445

mammal communities, dimensionality will depend on the representation of biological

446

diversity used in matrix M, which influences practical decisions regarding which

447

metrics are the most important for characterizing biodiversity.

448

At least for the cricetid and marsupial communities analyzed here,

449

characterizing diversity through functional and taxonomic components requires great

450

care in the choice of diversity metrics to be used. This is because this situation has the

451

highest complementarity regarding diversity dimensions (highest EE value),

452

indicating the need to rely on different components of diversity to effectively describe

453

biodiversity, and a moderate level of redundancy in metrics, indicating that some

454

metrics account for disproportionately more information than others. In this example,

455

richness accounted for more information than the other metrics, but consideration of

456

other components that represent functional information is also important for

457

effectively characterizing biological diversity. This functional component can be

19

458

represented by FDiv or FEve, which are very redundant in information. On the other

459

hand, if the characterization of small mammal communities was focused on

460

phylogenetic and taxonomic components, the choice of metrics to be used would

461

require less caution since complementarity among dimensions is lower and

462

redundancy of information is greater, indicating that all the metrics capture similar

463

amounts of information of biodiversity space.

464

When considering matrix M with all eight diversity metrics, applying the

465

dimensionality framework to small mammal communities revealed that cricetids and

466

marsupials possess intermediate to low levels of complementarity (mean EE of 0.51

467

±0.025). Together with low complementarity, low levels of redundancy among the

468

metrics was found when considering the three components of biodiversity together

469

(mean IV evenness of 0.63 ±0.082). Consequently, we suggest that the choice of

470

diversity metrics to effectively represent these communities must encompass the three

471

components of diversity — choosing the PSV metric, which accounts for the highest

472

IV, and two other complementary metrics to represent taxonomic (richness) and

473

functional components (FD that has the highest IV among functional metrics, as

474

shown in Figure 6).

475

The patterns of IV values for small mammal communities contrasted with the

476

findings of Wilsey et al. (2005) and Lyashevska and Farnsworth (2012), who

477

concluded that richness was the least important diversity metric for representing

478

variation in community structure (grassland and marine benthic communities,

479

respectively). Although we did not considered abundance-based metrics, as these

480

studies did, we point out that patterns of complementarity and redundancy can differ

481

depending on the taxonomic group being investigated and the metrics being used (as

482

already emphasized by our empirical application of the IV framework with different

20

483

configurations of matrix M). This finding highlights the need to understand

484

contingencies in the correlation and variation components of the dimensionality of

485

different communities.

486

We only used metrics that capture three sources of information from

487

biodiversity (phylogenetic, functional and taxonomic), since they are the main

488

assessed components of diversity and represent important metrics for capturing

489

different dimensions of these components (Tucker et al. 2017). Despite the limited

490

number of metrics presented in this work, the dimensionality framework used here is

491

highly flexible in the sense that it can be applied to a matrix M that contains many

492

more dimensions (Ricotta 2005). Therefore, we could represent diversity in a much

493

more complete manner, with metrics that capture other quantifiable components such

494

as genomic (e.g. Nei 1978), proteomic (e.g. Gotelli et al. 2013b) or any other

495

dimension that can be quantified.

496

Conclusion and future directions

497

This work represents an upgrade of the operationalization of the concept of

498

dimensionality presented by previous works. We demonstrate that including the

499

correlation component of dimensionality with the variation component, through the

500

use of EE and IV, in the same framework more effectively characterizes the

501

dimensionality of biodiversity.

502

Besides conceptual and operational advances, the dimensionality framework

503

proposed here provides evidence regarding practical situations in which the choice of

504

diversity metrics is more critical for effectively characterizing biodiversity. The use of

505

this dimensionality framework can help identify these different situations and assist in

506

choosing metrics.

507

Since the evidence presented in the literature regarding characterization of

508

dimensionality is limited (Lyashevska and Farnsworth 2012, Stevens and Tello 2014,

509

2018, Stevens and Gavilanez 2015), and based only on specific groups of organisms,

510

some questions still need to be addressed to provide a more complete understanding

511

and generalization of the role that some factors play in the dimensionality of

512

ecological communities. For instance, one might wonder if some dimensions of

513

diversity are consistently more informative than others when describing diversity

514

patterns among different taxa, or if distinct factors (historical, evolutionary and/or

515

ecological) generate predictably higher or lower levels of dimensionality across

516

communities.

Figure 1: A) A set of communities described by two diversity metrics (Metric 1 and

609

Metric 2) that are highly correlated. This pattern of correlation can be related to two

610

diversity metrics that account for similar amounts of variation in the reduced

611

biodiversity space (B, high redundancy), or be a situation in which one metric has

612

disproportional importance for capturing variation in biodiversity space (C, low

613

redundancy).

614

Figure 2: Schematic representation of simulated scenarios and expected outcomes for

615

EE and IV. The abscissa represents the variation component of dimensionality.

616

Metacommunities were simulated to show similar values of variation among metrics

617

(lower left quadrant) or different values of variation among metrics (lower right

618

quadrant), so that, respectively, similar and different IV values among diversity

619

metrics are expected. The ordinate represents the correlation component of

620

dimensionality. Metacommunities were simulated that had metrics with high (upper

621

right panel) and low correlation, so that, respectively, low and high EE values are

622

expected.

Figure 3: Bar plots showing IV and EE calculated for metacommunities simulated

624

according different scenarios (HiC/EqV, HiC/DifV, LoC/EqV and LoC/DifV) using

625

PD, FD and richness metrics in matrix M. For each of these scenarios situations were

626

presented in which the metrics contribute similarly or unequally in biodiversity space

627

( variation in ordinate axis) and are highly or lowly correlated (variation in abscissa

628

axis).
