Abstract
Objective: To assess genetic modifiers of Parkinson’s disease (PD) age at onset (AAO)
penetrance in individuals carrying common and rare LRRK2 risk alleles
Methods: We analysed reported genetic modifier DNM3 rs2421947 in 724 LRRK2 p.G2019S
heterozygotes using linear regression of AAO. We meta-analysed our data with previously
published data (n=754). VAMP4 is in close proximity to DNM3 and is associated with PD. We
analysed the effect of the rs11578699 VAMP4 variant on pG2019S penetrance in
786 LRRK2 p.G2019S heterozygotes. We also evaluated the impact of VAMP4 variants using
AAO regression in 4882 patients with PD carrying a common LRRK2 risk variant (rs10878226).
Results: There was no evidence for linkage disequilibrium between DNM3 rs2421947
and VAMP4 rs11578699. Our linear regression AAO of 724 p.G2019S carriers showed no
relationship between DNM3 rs2421947 and AAO (beta = -1.19, p = 0.55, n =708). Metaanalysis with previously published data did not indicate a significant effect on AAO (beta = 2.21, p = 0.083, n = 1304), but there was significant heterogeneity in the analyses of new and
previously published data. VAMP4 rs11578699 was nominally associated with AAO in patients
dichotomized by the common LRRK2 risk variant rs10878226 (beta=1.68, se=0.81 p=0.037).
Interpretation: Analysis of DNM3 in previously unpublished data does not show an interaction
between DNM3 and LRRK2 G2019S for AAO, however the inter-study heterogeneity may
indicate ethnic-specific effects of DNM3 rs2421947. Analysis of sporadic PD patients stratified
by the PD risk variant rs10878226 indicates a possible interaction between LRRK2 and VAMP4.

Introduction (words: 427)
The p.G2019S coding variant in the LRRK2 gene is the most common high penetrance mutation
causing parkinsonism. The mutation occurs in 1-40% of PD cases, varying by ethnicity (1).
LRRK2 parkinsonism is broadly similar to “idiopathic” disease in clinical manifestations and age
at onset (AAO), generating interest in its potential as a therapeutic target with broader
application to PD (2). In addition to rare pathogenic mutations, genome wide association studies
(GWAS) show that common variation in LRRK2 is a risk factor for sporadic PD (3) (23).
There is a wide range in PD AAO among p.G2019S carriers. It is estimated that the heritability
of PD AAO (~0.11) is lower than the overall heritability of risk for PD (~0.27) (4). Currently the
strongest genetic association with AAO is through genetic risk score (GRS). There is overlap
between the heritability of risk, as quantified in the GRS, and AAO. As LRRK2 is a functionally
complex protein with many protein-protein interaction domains, there may be diverse genetic
modifiers that vary in effect size and frequency. Trinh and colleagues (5) presented evidence of
modification by a common variant haplotype tag in DNM3 (rs2421947), for which the median
onset of LRRK2 parkinsonism for GG homozygotes was 12·5 years younger than that of CC
homozygotes (direction of effect GG < GC < CC), suggesting that the C allele or a linked variant
may be protective against the development of PD. Similarly, Fernandez-Santiago and
colleagues (6) observed a consistent trend for the rs2421947 G allele on AAO in LRRK2
p.G2019S carriers, with median onset 3 years younger in patients with the G allele, though the
result was not significant. Foo and colleagues (2018) found no impact of DNM3 in PD AAO in
individuals carrying Asian LRRK2 risk alleles (24).
In the largest GWAS meta-analysis of idiopathic PD the nearby VAMP4 gene variant
rs11578699, located 113,325 bp from DNM3 rs2421947, emerged as a statistically significant
PD risk association, raising the possibility the effect of DNM3 may relate to linkage
disequilibrium with VAMP4 (7). LRRK2 has a role in both monogenic and idiopathic/sporadic
forms of PD and overlap in genetic modifiers may exist.
We carried out a large replication candidate gene study investigating the impact of reported
genetic modifier DNM3 rs2421947 and the nearby GWAS association VAMP4 rs11578699 on
AAO. We specifically sought to replicate the discovery finding, to determine whether the
association might vary with ethnicity and whether linkage disequilibrium with VAMP4 may be
relevant to this association. We analyzed a multi-ethnic cohort of European, North African, and
Ashkenazi Jewish LRRK2 p.G2019S carriers and a larger cohort of European patients with and
without the LRRK2 common risk allele.
Methods
Data collection
Patient cohorts: LRRK2 p.G2019S heterozygotes were identified from cohorts in the
International Parkinson’s Disease Genomics Consortium (IPDGC) and other collaborative
centres. Data from 724 LRRK2 p.G2019S heterozygotes was contributed by the National
Institute of Health (NIH), University College London (UCL), McGill University (MU) (samples
were collected in Columbia University (CU) and Sheba Medical Centre (SMC)), Sorbonne
University (SU) (in collaboration with Habib Bourguiba hospital, Sfax, Tunisia, and Blida
Hospital, Blida, Algeria), National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), and
the University of Tübingen (TU). Data from two published studies analyzing DNM3 rs2421947

and LRRK2 p.G2019S parkinsonism with AAO was also included comprising 754 participants
(5, 6). All studies willing to participate and currently holding minimum required data for LRRK2
p.G2019S carriers were included: PD onset age or sampling age for asymptomatic carriers; and
DNM3 rs2421947 or a high RSQ proxy SNP. Where these studies had also genotyped VAMP4
rs11578699 or a high RSQ proxy, these data were also included in the analysis of the VAMP4
gene (n=786). Patients with PD without a known Mendelian or high risk genetic cause of
disease were collated from the UK-wide Tracking Parkinson’s study (8) and from IPDGC
datasets. Summary statistics for DNM3 rs2421947 and VAMP4 rs11578699 were obtained from
the most recent large-scale PD GWAS (7) and PD AAO GWAS (4). All studies were approved
by each respective institutional ethics review committee and all participants provided written
informed consent. All studies were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (9).
Genetic analyses: Genotyping was performed on different platforms (Neurochip array, NeuroX
array, TaqMan assays, Infinium OmniExpress-24, and Illumina HumanCore Exome array) at
participating centres. The LRRK2 p.G2019S mutation was directly genotyped. Sanger sequence
or KASPar verification of the DNM3 rs2421947 variant was carried out on data subsets at study
specific centres. Where the variant DNM3 rs2421947 was imputed, only RSQ values above
0.85 were used, and only RSQ values above 0.75 were used for VAMP4 rs11578699 (table-e1),
as the RSQ quality of available data for variants VAMP4 rs11578699 was lower. 1478 LRRK2
p.G2019S carriers were identified across study cohorts. 2052 samples from patients with
idiopathic PD from the Tracking Parkinson’s disease study passed quality control and had no
identified genetic cause of disease (8). 96 patients with PD were excluded due to missing AAO
data; therefore 1956 patients with PD and without LRRK2 p.G2019S were included in further
analysis. Summary statistics and patient data from the most recent PD GWAS included over
37.7K cases, 18.6K ‘proxy-cases’ and 1.4M controls. The most recent PD AAO GWAS included
data from 28.6K patients (4,7).
Statistical analyses: Data from the studies were pooled. We calculated Hardy-Weinberg
Equilibrium (HWE) for VAMP4 rs11578699 and DNM3 rs2421947 in p.G2019S carriers. QC
HWE for iPD and controls is summarized in the recent large-scale PD GWAS. We assessed
linkage disequilibrium (LD) measures RSQ and D’ between DNM3 rs2421947 and VAMP4
rs11578699 in different populations to evaluate the possibility that an extended haplotype block
might explain the relationship between DNM3 and LRRK2 (table e-2). The allele based Fisher’s
exact test was used to compare DNM3 rs2421947 and VAMP4 rs11578699 minor allele
frequencies (MAF) between LRRK2 p.G2019S heterozygotes of different ethnic backgrounds
and with idiopathic PD (table 1). Student’s t-tests and ANOVA were used to assess differences
in AAO by genotype (table 2). We then analyzed the effect of DNM3 rs2421947 (figure 1) on
AAO in idiopathic PD in the Tracking Parkinson’s dataset using linear regression of AAO, and
Kaplan Meier survival analysis. Next, we analyzed patients with LRRK2 p.G2019S of Ashkenazi
Jewish, North African and European ethnicity using linear regression of AAO with available
covariates of sex, ethnicity, relatedness and study centre of origin (figure 2). AAO was
regressed by DNM3 rs2421947 genotypes, and separately for rs11578699 VAMP4 genotypes.
We meta-analyzed DNM3 rs2421947 data from all previously unpublished datasets using linear
regression models (figure 2B). We pooled these data with previously published data and metaanalyzed again with the same methods (figure 2C and D). We then analyzed VAMP4
rs11578699 impact on AAO with linear regression (figure 2E and F). Bonferroni or other
corrections for multiple testing were not performed as this is a candidate gene-based study.
Finally, we analyzed the impact of VAMP4 rs11578699 on AAO in idiopathic PD carrying the
LRRK2 rs10878226 variant. LRRK2 rs10878226 has also been implicated in PD risk (odds ratio
[OR], 1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08–1.33; p = 6.3×10−4, n=6129) (3).

Gene expression: Gene expression profiles of DNM3 rs2421947 and VAMP4 rs11578699
were assessed using publicly available Web-based resources: BRAINEACv.2
(www.braineac.org) (11); GTEx (www.gtexportal.org); and Allen Brain Atlas (www.brainmap.org) (12), and evaluated based on the significance level required for inclusion in
colocalization (COLOC) analysis (appendix e-1).
Results
DNM3 rs2421947 and VAMP4 rs11578699 genotypes were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in
controls.
There was no LD between DNM3 rs2421947 and VAMP4 rs11578699, as assessed through
RSQ and D’, within or across population samples, indicating that these are independent variants
(table e-2)
We investigated the possibility that ethnic variation in allele frequency might explain a variable
effect of DNM3 on affected LRRK2 penetrance. Aside from the Norwegian cohort DNM3
rs2421947 MAF (C) of 0.69 (vs. other Europeans p=0.00012), all DNM3 rs2421947 MAF in the
study were between 0.43-0.51 (table 1). There was no difference between Ashkenazi Jews and
European frequencies (p=0.94); or between Ashkenazi Jews and North Africans (p=0.28); nor
between Europeans and North Africans (p=0.54) at this locus. Publicly available allele
frequencies (http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org) were similar (table 1). VAMP4 rs11578699 MAF
were between 0.15-0.30 in different populations.
We assessed possible association between these variants and p.G2019S genotype using the
allele based Fisher’s exact test. There was no association between DNM3 rs2421947 and
p.G2019S genotype in all PD cases (p=0.42). There was no significant difference in DNM3
allele frequencies between patients with PD and asymptomatic heterozygotes (asymptomatic
p.G2019S heterozygotes were of Ashkenazi Jewish, North African, and European non-Jewish
ethnicity), as assessed through Fisher’s Exact test (p=0.056). When the previous data was
meta-analyzed with the current data there was a significant association between DNM3
rs2421947 and PD affected status in p.G2019S heterozygotes (p=3.1x10-5) by the Fisher’s
Exact test, although there were differences between populations (Table 1). Mean sampling age
for p.G2019S heterozygotes without PD was 56 years across all ethnicities; 63 years in AJ
subjects; and 56 years for Europeans.
In the most recent PD GWAS there was no genome-wide significant association between DNM3
rs2421947 and PD by logistic regression, (p=0.0051). There was no association between
VAMP4 rs11578699 and LRRK2 p.G2019S status in European PD (p=0.60) and no significant
difference in VAMP4 rs11578699 MAF between LRRK2 p.G2019S patients and asymptomatic
carriers by the Fisher’s Exact test (p=0.64).

We then assessed the relationship between AAO and DNM3 rs2421947 and VAMP4
rs11578699 (table 2) using t-tests and ANOVA. There was no effect of DNM3 rs2421947 on
AAO as assessed through ANOVA (p=0.55, F=0.59, df=2, n=708). When meta-analysed with
data from previous cohorts there was a nominal effect of DNM3 on AAO (2 years difference
between G and C genotypes), (p=0.021, F=3.88, df=2, n=1304).

We carried out a multi-ethnic meta-analysis of newly contributed data of DNM3 rs2421947 GG
versus CC and CG genotypes against onset age in 724 LRRK2 p.G2019S carriers, using a
random effects model on disease-free survival. Linear regression meta-analysis on PD AAO
was not significant (beta = -1.19, p = 0.55, n =708), though I2 heterogeneity was 86.9%, p <
0.01. The impact of GG versus CC and CG was not significant in sub-group analyses (figure 2).
When our new data was pooled with the two previous studies and meta-analysed, linear
regression meta-analysis of LRRK2 p.G2019S AAO was not significant (beta = -2.21, p = 0.083,
n = 1304). I2 total heterogeneity for linear regression meta-analysis was 82.3%, p<0.0001
(figure 2).

Meta-analysis of the impact of VAMP4 rs11578699 (the genome-wide significant association in
a recent large-scale Parkinson’s disease GWAS) on AAO in LRRK2 p.G2019S parkinsonism
was not significant for CC versus TT and TC genotypes (beta = -0.25, p=0.75, n=756). ). I2 total
heterogeneity was <0.001%, p=0.75 (figure 2).
We evaluated the possibility of ethnic specific effects using linear regression of AAO (figure 2).
Though in each subgroup analysis confidence intervals overlapped zero, there appeared to be a
trend towards earlier onset in G allele carriers of Ashkenazi Jewish ethnicity, consistent with
previously reported data, and in the discovery data effects were strongest in Arab Berbers
suggesting ethnic specific effects.
Using cox proportional survival analysis, we studied the discovery data and subsequent cohorts
separately (GG versus CC and CG as described previously). There was a strong association
between rs2421947 and PD AAO in discovery data (hazard ratio [HR] 1.59, 95% CI 1.28-1.97,
p<0.001). This was also present through AAO linear regression analysis (beta = -4.93, p =
0.00019). The association was absent in our replication data (hazard ratio [HR] 1.09, 95% CI
0.95-1.26, p = 0.22).
We meta-analyzed the samples studied in this paper with the discovery data (Figure 2).

indicated. Analyses are carried out on ethnicity subgroups: Ashkenazi Jewish (Summary: AJ),
European (Summary: EU), and North African (Summary: NA).
Finally, we investigated the possibility that might be an interaction between the GWAS defined
common LRRK2 risk allele (rs10878226) and VAMP4. We analyzed 4882 cases with PD
carrying the LRRK2 risk variant minor allele using linear regression of AAO and plotting of the
Kaplan Meier curve, as shown in Figure 3. TT versus TC and CC VAMP4 rs11578699
genotype was nominally significantly associated with AAO risk in this cohort (beta=1.68,
se=0.81, p=0.037, n=4882). VAMP4 rs11578699 was not significantly associated with AAO risk
in idiopathic PD cases without the LRRK2 rs10878226 risk variant (beta=-0.28, se=0.48,
p=0.56, n=14970). Far fewer patients with idiopathic PD had been genotyped for DNM3
rs2421947 in the PD GWAS cohort (table 1), meaning we were not able to assess interaction
between DNM3 and the LRRK2 risk allele.

We then reviewed VAMP4 and DNM3 human brain gene expression and co-expression data
from the BRAINEACv223 (11), GTEx, and Allen Atlas databases (12) (figure e-3). VAMP4
rs11578699 is an eQTL for VAMP4 expression: NES: 0.29, p = 3.5x10-9 (cerebellum, GTEx
database); NES: 0.32, p = 6.5x10-7 (cerebellar hemisphere, GTEx database). DNM3 rs2421947
did not appear to be an eQTL for DNM3 expression in the brain in the GTex database, though
VAMP4 and DNM3 gene expression in brain were high (figure e-3).
Discussion
We have analyzed the effect of DNM3 rs2421947 on AAO in LRRK2 p.G2019S parkinsonism.
We have not replicated the association between DNM3 and LRRK2 p.G2019S AAO in this study
or in meta-analysis with all available data. In the original discovery analysis, there was a
difference of 12.5 years between DNM3 rs2421947 GG and CC genotypes (meta-analysis HR
1·61, 95% CI 1·15–2·27, p=0·02). In our data the AAO difference between GG and CC
genotypes was 1.4 years, which was not significant. Using AAO regression, meta-analysis of
independent sample series in newly genotyped samples did not identify a significant difference
in AAO between genotypes (beta = -1.19, p = 0.55, n =708). Similarly, when discovery and
replication data was analyzed together there was no significant effect of DNM3 rs2421947 on
AAO (beta = -2.21, p = 0.083, n = 1304). However, there was significant heterogeneity in
replication and combined DNM3 regression meta-analyses.
In “sporadic” PD, consistent with the recent AAO GWAS (4), our study indicated that DNM3
rs2421947 does not affect AAO in non-p.G2019S disease.
We did not identify linkage disequilibrium between DNM3 and VAMP4, nor an independent
effect of VAMP4 on LRRK2 penetrance. Analysis of carriers of a common LRRK2 risk SNP
provided nominally significant support for a potential interaction between VAMP4 and LRRK2,
which requires replication in larger sample sizes. Gene expression analysis indicated that
VAMP4 rs11578699 is an eQTL for VAMP4 expression.
One possibility for the lack of replication of DNM3 modification of p.G2019S AAO is that
heterogeneity in the sample may limit the observed effect in the meta-analysis; this has
previously led to non-replication in independent samples in genome-wide association studies
(13) (14). Significant heterogeneity was observed in the linear regression meta-analysis of
replication and combined data in this study, which may be explained by ethnicity effects. The
impact of DNM3 may vary between ethnicities or be population specific, and the strongest
effects were seen in Ashkenazi Jewish p.G2019S carriers although not reaching significance
(Figure 2). Further studies in large numbers of Ashkenazi Jewish and Arab patients are
needed.
Due to its role in innate immunity LRRK2 may have been under different selective pressures in
human evolution, relating to differences in environmental pathogens. Interestingly, LRRK2
p.G2019S penetrance varies across ethnic groups. Hentati and colleagues (15) have reported
a later AAO in LRRK2 p.G2019S carriers from Norway as compared to Tunisian patients. Lee
and colleagues (16) indicated later AAO penetrance for Ashkenazi Jewish PD p.G2019S
carriers compared to non-Jewish carriers through plotting of estimated cumulative risk, though
this was not significant; penetrance was 42.5% (95% CI: 26.3-65.8%) in non-Ashkenazi Jewish
relatives compared to 25% (95% CI: 16.7%-34.2%) in Ashkenazi Jewish heterozygous relatives.
These data imply that there may be potential protective factors in the relatively homogeneous

Norwegian and Ashkenazi Jewish population and that ethnic and population effects are likely to
be very important in analyzing this variant. Our analysis and comparison of background allele
frequencies in this study suggest that this is unlikely to primarily relate to VAMP4 and DNM3.
However, there may be other rare variant effects that will emerge with fine mapping of this
region.
The LRRK2 common risk variant analysis is of interest; the variant is not a proxy for p.G2019S
in Europeans, so this represents an independent marker of PD risk. Around a quarter (24.6%)
of sporadic PD cases carry the common LRRK2 risk variant rs10878226, which is associated
with PD (combined odds ratio [OR], 1.20, 95% CI, 1.08-1.33, p=6.3×10-4, n=6129) (3). Our
common LRRK2 variant analysis indicates a possible interaction between common variation in
LRRK2 and VAMP4, which requires further study. VAMP4 and LRRK2 are both involved in
synaptic vesicle dynamics, which has relevance to the etiology of PD. Underscoring this
possibility, analysis of VAMP4 and DNM3 expression indicated that both are highly expressed in
the brain, though these are not in LD and likely represent independent signals.
Modifiers of the penetrance of LRRK2 p.G20129S are likely to be therapeutic targets and may
be important in genetic counselling. Our large study, aggregating new and previously published
data has indicated significant heterogeneity across studies, but not provided robust replication
of an interaction between DNM3 and LRRK2 p.G2019S. Further genome-wide studies in
different populations are needed, to resolve the determinants of the variable penetrance seen in
individuals with p.G2019S.

Supplementary methods
For the meta-analyses data was divided into the same ethnicity subgroups (Ashkenazi Jewish,
North African, and European), and study centre specific groups. Where there were <60
datapoints from a particular study centre for DNM3 rs2421947, data was pooled, and study
centre of origin was used as a covariate. Cox proportional hazards model analyses and linear
regressions for p.G2019S carriers were carried out on GG versus CC and CG genotypes, as
exploratory data analysis indicated a dominant protective effect of the minor C allele. For the
VAMP4 rs11578699 variant these survival methods were carried out on CC versus TC and TT
due to the smaller number of TT genotypes available. Family relatedness, sex, and principal
components of ancestry were used as covariates, where available, in each analysis.
A random-effects model was used in meta-analyses. Natural logs of hazard ratios for GG versus
CC and CG genotypes were taken for DNM3 rs2421947, and for CC versus TC and TT for
VAMP4 rs11578699. The log of standard errors was calculated using outputted hazard ratio
confidence intervals, using the Taylor expansion with leading term (also known as the delta
method) (17).

RSQ and D’ were calculated in PLINK 1.9 (18). The allele based Fisher’s Exact test, ANOVA,
Student’s t tests, and linear regressions (PD onset age regressed on DNM3 rs2421947
genotype, and separately VAMP4 rs11578699 genotype) were performed in base R RStudio
(19). Cox proportional hazards survival analysis and Kaplan Meier curves were carried out using
the Terry Therneau “Survival” package (20) in RStudio (19). Time-to-event in survival analyses
was the self-reported age at which a participant developed motor symptoms of PD. For
p.G2019S carriers without PD time-to-event was right-censored from sampling age. Metaanalysis was carried out in metafor (21) and metaviz R packages (22).
We supplemented the analysis of LRRK2 p.G2019S by analysing time-to-event (by DNM3
rs2421947 and VAMP4 rs11578699) genotypes in PD cases carrying the LRRK2 risk variant
rs10878226 (4). We identified 4882 PD cases heterozygous or homozygous for the minor risk
allele from the 21,242 PD cases in IPDGC datasets. Linear regression of AAO, Kaplan Meier
and Cox proportional hazards analyses were then performed on VAMP4 rs11578699 genotypes
against age at onset. These methods were carried out on TT versus TC and CC genotypes as
exploratory data analysis indicated an effect of the homozygous T allele on AAO. Covariates of
sex, ethnicity (PC1-PC10) and dataset were used. We carried out the same analysis on 14970
PD cases not carrying the LRRK2 rs10878226 variant.
Gene Expression
The BRAINEACv2 database hosts data on brain tissues (frontal cortex, temporal cortex, parietal
cortex, occipital cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, putamen, substantia nigra, medulla,
cerebellum, and white matter) from 134 healthy controls. The GTEx database consists of 8555
samples from 53 tissues (including 13 brain regions) from 544 donors. The Allen Human Brain
Atlas database microarray data is from 8 neuropathologically normal individuals of varying
ethnicity, and covers ~150 brain regions.

Cox proportional hazard analysis
DNM3 did not influence time to the development of disease in idiopathic PD by the Cox
proportional hazards model (hazard ratio [HR] 0.98, 95% CI 0.89-1.07, p = 0·60, n=1956) for
GG versus CC and CG carriers. DNM3 rs2421947 did not significantly affect the age associated
hazards of developing p.G2019S parkinsonism through random effects meta-analysis in our
previously unpublished data (hazard ratio [HR] 1.09, 95% CI 0.95-1.25, p = 0.20, n=724), as
shown in Figure 2 . I2 heterogeneity was <0.01% (p = 0.42). When our new data was pooled
with the two previous studies and meta-analysed, there was a nominally significant effect of
DNM3 rs2421947 on AAO in LRRK2 p.G2019S parkinsonism ([HR] 1.14, 95% CI, 1.02-1.27, p
= 0.025, n = 1478). I2 total heterogeneity was 22.8%, p=0.37.
VAMP4 rs11578699 was nominally associated with disease AAO in idiopathic PD cases
