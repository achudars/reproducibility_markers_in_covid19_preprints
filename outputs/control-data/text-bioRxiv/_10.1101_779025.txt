Abstract

24

HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND) affect over half of HIV-infected individuals

25

worldwide, despite antiretroviral therapy (ART). Therapeutically targetable mechanisms

26

underlying HAND remain elusive. We developed a human-induced pluripotent stem cell (HiPSC)

27

based model; whereby, we independently differentiate HiPSCs into neurons, astrocytes, and

28

microglia and systematically combine to generate a tri-culture with or without HIV-infection and

29

ART. scRNAseq analysis on tri-cultures including HIV-infected microglia revealed inflammatory

30

signatures in the microglia and EIF2 signaling in all three cell types. Remarkably, EFZ alone

31

induced a similar response to infection. Treatment with the antiretroviral compound Efavirenz

32

(EFZ) mostly resolved these signatures; However, EFZ increased RhoGDI and CD40 signaling in

33

the HIV-infected microglia. This activation was associated with a persistent increase in TNFa

34

expression. This work establishes a tri-culture that recapitulates key features of HIV infection in

35

the CNS and provides a new model to examine the effects of HIV infection and its treatment with

36

antiretrovirals.

Introduction

38

HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND) are a chronic, progressing spectrum of

39

diseases that lead to a range of neurologic disorders, including HIV-associated dementia. The

40

major pathologic manifestation that persists in HAND patients with antiretroviral treatment

41

(ART) is synaptodendritic damage and the accumulation of microglia, the immune cell in the

42

central nervous system (CNS); however, the mechanisms underlying synaptic damage remain

43

elusive. Synapse loss is associated with infiltration of macrophages from outside of the CNS and

44

activation of microglia. Both HIV-infected macrophage populations can release cytokines, viral

45

proteins, and excitotoxins, which can lead to synaptic damage (Saylor et al., 2016). Activated

46

microglia aberrantly phagocytosing synapses have been described in multiple neurological

47

disorders including: Alzheimer’s, Frontotemporal Dementia, and Multiple Sclerosis (Keren-Shaul

48

et al., 2017; Lui et al., 2016; Salter & Stevens, 2017; Zrzavy et al., 2017). While patients on ART

49

experience milder forms of HAND, they still experience chronic inflammation (Kolson, 2017).

50

Infected microglia and uninfected, but active microglia may be working in tandem to slowly

51

release proinflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species that, over time, can lead to

52

synaptodendritic damage.

53

Inflammation, via various pathways, plays a large role in the neurodegeneration seen in

54

HAND. Our lab and others have implicated the unfolded protein response (UPR), a part of the

55

integrated stress response (ISR) in neurodegeneration including in HAND (Walter & Ron, 2011).

56

EIF2 activation, downstream of UPR activation, has been implicated in HAND (C. Akay et al., 2012;

57

K. A. Lindl, Akay, Wang, White, & Jordan‐Sciutto, 2007), progressive supranuclear palsy and

58

Alzheimer’s disease (Stutzbach et al., 2013). CD40 has also been implicated in viral replication

59

control and microglia activation during HIV infection (D'Aversa, Eugenin, & Berman, 2008;

60

Kornbluth, 2000; Sui et al., 2007). CD40 signaling is implicated in multiple cellular processes

61

including inflammatory response. Specifically, CD40 activation can lead to, CD40 activation can

62

lead to activation of the NF-κB non canonical pathway and the production of IL-8 and TNFa

63

(D'Aversa et al., 2008; Homig-Holzel et al., 2008). TNFa, in turn, can activate the NADPH oxidase

64

complex (Y.-S. Kim, Morgan, Choksi, & Liu, 2007). Similarly, RhoGDI normally anchors Rac1, but

65

during inflammation, Rac1 is released from RhoGDI and moves to the plasma membrane where

66

it interacts with the NADPH oxidase complex which creates superoxide when activated

67

(Wilkinson & Landreth, 2006) and regulates cytokine and neurotoxin release by microglia

68

exposed to HIV-Tat (Turchan–Cholewo et al., 2009). Understanding how various endogenous

69

pathways may influence HAND using a therapeutic relevant model is important.

70

While the major pathological manifestation of HAND is synaptodendritic damage, the

71

response during initial exposure to HIV and ART is unknown partly because current models for

72

HIV-mediated neuroinflammation are limited by species differences and human tropism of the

73

virus. For instance, the HIV-1 Tat transgenic mouse model exhibits neuroinflammation and

74

behavioral deficits, but only expresses a single viral protein from astrocytes (Carey, Sypek, Singh,

75

Kaufman, & McLaughlin, 2012; B. O. Kim et al., 2003; Langford et al., 2018). Another HIV-1

76

transgenic mouse model has neuroinflammation, but is missing two of the genes, gag and pol,

77

and is expressed in every cell in the body (Reid et al., 2001). Lastly, while isolated microglia from

78

human patients can give great insight, it is only a snapshot of the end stage of the disease.

79

Therefore, the development of a novel in vitro human system allowing the interaction of the main

80

cell types involved in HAND is needed to further understand the neuropathogenesis and develop

81

novel therapeutics.

82

We have developed a Human-induced pluripotent stem cell (HiPSC) based model whereby

83

we separately differentiate HiPSCs into forebrain-like excitatory neurons, astrocytes, and

84

microglia then combine them to create a tri-culture, with or without HIV-infection of the

85

microglia, and with or without ART. Our protocol rapidly produces microglia-like cells (iMg) that

86

express multiple classical markers in mono-culture, productively infect with HIV, and respond to

87

ART. In addition, we have developed a differentiation protocol for astrocyte-like cells (iAst) that

88

express hallmark proteins. Utilizing this system, we investigated the effects of Infection (Inf),

89

Infection with the antiretroviral Efavirenz (EFZ) (Inf+EFZ), and EFZ treatment alone (Uninf+EFZ),

90

compared to uninfected tri-cultures (Uninf) and to each other. We found that EFZ treatment in

91

infected conditions did not simply attenuate the inflammatory response but created a distinct

92

reaction. In addition, EFZ treatment alone invoked its own discrete inflammatory response. We

93

revealed gene expression changes leading to activation of EIF2 signaling in iMg, iAst, and iNrn,

94

and highly activated inflammatory cytokine signaling in iMg in the Inf condition. EIF2 signaling

95

persisted exclusively in the iNrns in the Inf+EFZ condition. While infection lead to increased

96

inflammation in the iMg, it also led to decreased synaptophagy. EFZ treatment in infected

97

cultures did not reverse the phagocytosis impairment but did quell the inflammation except for

98

distinct gene activation of CD40 and RhoGDI signaling in the iMg. Lastly EFZ treatment itself lead

99

to a very similar response as Inf. Our system has reveals the complex roles of the individual cell

100

types during infection ± ART and how ART alone can elicit an inflammatory response.

114

iMicroglia exhibit similar gene and protein expression as other iPSC-derived microglia

115

We modified two previously published protocols to generate the iMg (Abud et al., 2017;

116

Paluru et al., 2014) (Figure 1a). The first step is a nine-day differentiation of iPSCs into

117

CD41+CD235+ common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) (Paluru et al., 2014). The second step is a

118

modified 11-day protocol (Abud et al., 2017) that produces a highly pure population of iMg. We

119

tested this protocol on four separate cell lines. These iMg show ramification (Figure 1-figure

120

supplement 1a), express several classical markers, including: CX3CR1, IBA1, and P2RY12, at the

121

protein and RNA level (Figures 1b and 1c) in mono-culture, and have a significantly different gene

122

expression profile than monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) (Figure 1-figure supplement

123

1b). We validated the findings in BulkRNAseq with qRT-PCR. The iMg exhibited a 179-fold, 28-

124

fold, and 11-fold increase in CX3CR1, P2RY12, and TMEM119 respectively over MDMs (Figure 1d-

125

1f). Importantly they also express CCR5 (Figure 1-figure supplement 1c), one of the co-receptors

126

necessary for HIV infection (Deng et al., 1996). Utilizing PCA, we compared our iMg to human

127

MDMs we generated and the primary human adult and fetal microglia, iPSCs, induced

128

hematopoietic progenitor cells, and iMicroglia from (Abud et al., 2017). PCA revealed considerate

129

clustering of our iMg (pink) to the primary human microglia (blue) and previously published iPSC-

130

derived microglia (light orange) (Figure 1g).

144

iMg Are productively infected with HIV and respond to multiple antiretrovirals

145

We investigated the effects of HIV infection and ART in an iMg mono-culture. We first

146

determined infectivity of the iMg. We exposed the iMg to 50ng/mL of the CSF-derived, R5-tropic

147

JAGO strain of HIV (Chen et al., 2002). We performed a 15-day infection, based on prior studies

148

of MDMs (O'Donnell et al., 2006) which resulted in 94.5 ± 5.5% of the iMg positive for the HIV

149

capsid protein P24 (Figures 2a and 2b) and exhibited vast syncytia (Figure 2-figure supplement

150

1b). 89.1 ± 3.8% of P24(+) iMg were multi-nucleated (Figure 2c), and 100% of P24(-) iMg were

151

single-nucleated (Figure 2d). Reverse transcriptase activity showed peak viral production

152

occurred near day 15 (Figure 2e). iPSCs did not become infected at this concentration (Figure 2-

153

figure supplement 2b). We infected four separate iMg lines; however, one was heterozygous for

154

the CCR5Δ32 mutation, leading to impaired infection (Liu et al., 1996) (Figure 2-figure

155

supplement 2c and 2d). Therefore, we excluded it from all future analysis. To our knowledge, this

156

this the first time iPSC-derived microglia have been infected with HIV.

157

We tested two antiretroviral treatments that target different parts of the HIV life cycle,

158

Darunavir (DRN) and efavirenz (EFZ) (Figure 2-figure supplement 2a). DRN is a protease inhibitor

159

that prevents assembly of new virus (Wood & Flexner, 1998), and EFZ is a non-nucleoside reverse

160

transcriptase inhibitor that prevents reverse transcription of the viral genome (De Clercq, 2004).

161

We opted to focus on EFZ, as it is still a first line drug in many parts of the world (Best &

162

Goicoechea, 2008; Taramasso et al., 2018), Further, because it blocks HIV infection at the reverse

163

transcription phase, we can study non-productively infected, HIV-exposed cells alongside

164

productively infected cells.. Importantly, the infected iMg responded as expected to EFZ (Figures

165

2a, 2b, and Figure 2-figure supplement 2a). At day 15, 29.2 ± 6.3% of the iMg were infected

166

(Figures 2d and Figure 2-figure supplement 1c). 94.4 ± 1.72% of P24(+) iMg in the infected + EFZ

167

mono-culture were multi-nucleated (Figure 2d), and 100% of P24(-) iMg in the infected + EFZ

168

mono-culture were single-nucleated, same as the infected condition (Figure 2e).

169
170

Infected iMg produced proinflammatory cytokines at peak infection, and EFZ treatment

171

reduced the response

172

We also explored the changes in cytokine production over the course of infection ± EFZ.

173

Infection led to increased production of several pro-inflammatory cytokines, specifically IL-1b, IL-

174

1a, TNFa, and most prominently, IL-8 (Figures 2f-2i). However, the two other cytokines tested: IL-

175

6 and IL-10, did not change across any condition (Figure 2-figure supplement 3a-3c). IL-8

176

production was increased in cultured, infected, fetal microglia (Tatro, Soontornniyomkij,

177

Letendre, & Achim, 2014), and IL-1b RNA was increased in laser-captured microglia from brain

178

samples of HIV-infected patients (Ginsberg et al., 2018). Infected iMg cultures exposed to EFZ

179

had mitigated, non-significant responses to IL-1b, IL-8, TNFa, and IL-1a (Figures 2f-2i), suggesting

180

a reduced inflammatory reaction. Uninf, Uninf+EFZ and the DMSO vehicle control did not

181

elucidate a cytokine reaction across the six cytokines tested (Figure 2-figure supplement 3a-3e

182

and Figure 2-figure supplement 4a-4d).

183
184

Infected iMg have impaired cell cycle regulation and DNA repair and increased expression of

185

inflammatory genes

186

Bulk RNAseq of three iMg lines ± HIV infection revealed significant changes in cell cycle

187

regulation and DNA repair (Figure 2-figure supplement 5a). Infected immune cells will die quickly

188

after infection (Cummins & Badley, 2010), and we observed a high percentage of giant multi-

189

nucleated cells. Thus, it is unsurprising to see that most of the top canonical pathways altered

190

involved cell cycle and DNA repair. While no inflammatory pathways were identified by IPA

191

analysis, many inflammatory genes involved in the complement system, NF-κB signaling, and

192

TNFa signaling were significantly upregulated (Figure 2-figure supplement 5c). In addition, other

193

inflammatory genes including IL1b, CCL8, and FOS were also upregulated (Figure 2-figure

194

supplement 5c).

195

Collectively, these data show that the iMg exhibit an inflammatory response similar to the

196

that seen in the brain with increased production of IL-8, IL-1b, IL-1a, and TNFa. This inflammatory

197

response is strongly attenuated with Efavirenz treatment. Bulk RNAseq analysis revealed changes

198

in cell cycle and inflammation between uninfected and infected iMg, as expected.

212

iNeurons were produced utilizing the NGN2 differentiation protocol

213

We utilized a published NGN2 protocol (Zhang et al., 2013) to generate a homogenous

214

population of glutamatergic, forebrain-like excitatory neurons (Figure 3-figure supplement 1a

215

and 1b). Symptoms of HAND include loss of working memory, fine motor skills, and executive

216

function (Kathryn A. Lindl, Marks, Kolson, & Jordan-Sciutto, 2010; Saylor et al., 2016). Several of

217

these functions are controlled by the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, where most neurons

218

are excitatory, glutamatergic neurons (Fuster, Bodner, & Kroger, 2000; Masterman & Cummings,

219

1997; Miller, 2000). We confirmed these neurons generate synapses (Figure 3-figure supplement

220

1c).

221
222

iAstrocytes exhibit similar gene and protein expression as immature primary Astrocytes

223

We noticed that by day 2 of the NGN2 differentiation, the cells took on a neural precursor-

224

like phenotype, expressing the neural progenitor markers Nestin and NCAM (Lendahl,

225

Zimmerman, & McKay, 1990; Marmur et al., 1998), and the astrocyte marker SOX9 (Kang et al.,

226

2012) (Figure 3-figure supplement 2a). Since neural progenitors can differentiate into astrocytes

227

in vivo, we attempted to shift the neural differentiation at day 2 from neurons to astrocytes by

228

removing the NGN2-inducing agent doxycycline, and adding FGF-2, EGF, and FBS to promote

229

astrocyte differentiation (Figure 3a). After 90 days, a homogenous-appearing population of iAst

230

were produced (Figure 3b). Bulk RNAseq revealed similar expression of several key genes for

231

immature astrocytes between iAst and primary, fetal human astrocytes (Hu Ast) (Figure 3c and

232

3e). qRT-PCR validation of THBS1 confirmed no difference in expression Hu Ast and iAst (Figure

233

1d). The overall gene expression profile of the iAstrocytes is similar to fetal human primary

234

astrocytes (Figure 3e). We confirmed several of these genes at the protein level, including Nestin,

235

Glutamine Synthetase, THBS1 and SOX9 (Figure 3b), with 84.5 ± 22.9% expressing SOX9, 97.4 ±

236

2.3% expressing Nestin, 91.3 ± 2.4% expressing Glutamine Synthetase, and 46.5 ± 24.8%

237

expressing THBS1, an important protein in early synaptogenesis (Christopherson et al., 2005)

238

(Figure 3b); however, they did not express GFAP (Figure 3-figure supplement 2b). Additionally, in

239

mono-culture, they do not express the conventional glutamate transporter GLT-1 or GLAST

240

(Figure 3-figure supplement 2b and 2c). Although in tri-culture, scRNAseq showed expression of

241

GLT-1 (Figure 3-figure supplement 2e), which was not found in bulk RNAseq at the mono-culture

242

stage. Neuronal activity regulates GLT-1 in astrocytes (Awabdh et al., 2016; Perego et al., 2000;

243

Swanson et al., 1997), suggesting the iAst have a more in vivo-like phenotype when in the more

244

physiologically relevant tri-culture.

iAst respond to HIV-induced cytokines produced by the iMg

247

We also exposed the iAst in mono-culture to the most highly expressed cytokines in the

248

HIV-infected iMg, to determine if the cytokines produced by infected iMg can elicit an

249

inflammatory response in the iAst. We exposed the iAst to IL-1b and IL-8 at 10ng/mL for eight

250

hours and then analyzed the supernatants on the same six-cytokine panel. We found that, of the

251

six cytokines tested, the iAst produced increased amounts of IL-1a (Figure 2-figure supplement

252

5b), suggesting that the iMicroglia can elicit an inflammatory response in the iAst. In addition, it

253

is interesting that IL-1a was released given its role in producing A1 astrocytes (Liddelow et al.,

254

2017).

255
256

The HiPSC-derived tri-culture is sustainable with iAst and iMg derived from novel

257

differentiation protocols

258

In order to study the cell-cell interactions during HIV infection and subsequent

259

antiretroviral treatment (ART), we developed a novel tri-culture system of HiPSC-derived

260

microglia (iMg), neurons (iNrn), and astrocytes (iAst) by separately differentiating each cell type,

261

infecting the iMg (± ART), then co-plating the different populations into a carpet culture for

262

analysis. The tri-culture is able to survive for at least 2 weeks (Figure 3f).

271

scRNAseq identified each of the three cell types in all four conditions

272

Next, we studied the cell types’ reactions in a more physiologically relevant tri-culture. To

273

create the tri-culture, we began the iNrn differentiation, added the iAst at D5 of the iNrn

274

differentiation, after the Ara-C had been removed, and added the iMg at D7 of the iNrn

275

differentiation. The tri-culture was maintained for an additional 14 days, to D21 of the iNrn

276

differentiation (Figure 4a). To assay gene expression changes in each of the three cell types during

277

HIV infection ± EFZ, we conducted scRNAseq on the tri-culture under four conditions: Uninf, Inf,

278

Inf+EFZ, and Uninf+EFZ (Figure 4a). Cells were sequenced from the Uninf (n=6,564), Inf (n=7,431),

279

Inf+EFZ (n=7,111), and Uninf+ EFZ (n=10,071) conditions. All conditions were then aggregated

280

and initially analyzed through the cellranger pipeline (10x Genomics, v.3.0.1). Secondary analysis

281

was performed using the Seurat package in R. We generated 16 unbiased clusters (Figure 4b).

282

First, we separated the clusters by cell type, then broke down each cell cluster by condition. We

283

assigned clusters to one of the three cell types by expression of several key genes: iMg by

284

expression of IBA1, PU.1, and CD4; iNrn by expression of MAP2 and SYN1; and iAst by expression

285

of THBS1 and SOX9 (Figures 4c-4e). There were four clusters (cluster 5, 10, 12, and 13) that did

286

not fit into any of the three cell types by expression of the chosen markers (Figure 4b and 4f). To

287

determine what the fourth cell type might represent, we examined the expression of the top 20

288

genes in each of the 4 cell types (Figure 4g). The gene expression pattern of the undesignated

289

cells best matched the iAst, but scRNAseq did not capture expression of THBS1 or SOX9,

290

suggesting these cells represent less mature versions of the iAst. Hence, they were excluded from

291

further analysis (Figure 5a). We then separated each cell type by condition (Figure 5b).

301

iMg exhibit the largest inflammatory response by gene expression

302

After the scRNAseq was separated by cell type (Figure 5a) and condition (Figure 5b), We

303

examined a panel of inflammation, DNA accessibility, mitochondria, and translation/UPR-related

304

genes to determine which of the three cell types had the greatest changes in relevant gene

305

expression (Figure 5c). The iAst had the most prominent change in translation and UPR related

306

genes, with increased expression of several ribosomal genes and EIF2S2, a subunit of EIF2, in the

307

Inf condition compared to Uninf. Whereas, the iNrn had the largest increases in DNA accessibility

308

genes, including several histone-related genes. Not surprisingly, the iMg population showed the

309

highest expression of inflammatory and mitochondria related genes. Inf iMg had increased

310

expression of several inflammatory cytokine genes, including CXCL8 and IL-1b. This corroborates

311

with the increased production if IL-8 and IL-1b in infected iMg in mono-culture. The Inf+EFZ iMg

312

had lower expression levels than Inf iMg for these genes, again corroborating with the mono-

313

culture cytokine production. Although, the Inf+EFZ iMg had increased expression of the

314

inflammatory genes FOS and APOE, compared to control. These results suggest that the iMg are

315

mostly responsible for the inflammatory response during infection ± EFZ; however, there are

316

distinct responses ± EFZ. To further investigate the differences, we next performed pairwise

317

comparisons of each cell type across all four conditions.

326

Inflammatory pathways and EIF2 signaling were consistently dysregulated among all three cell

327

types during infection, but iMg were the most affected

328

We first compared the Inf condition to Uninf. Several inflammatory pathways were highly

329

activated in Inf iMg compared to Uninf iMg, including Il-8 and NF-κB signaling. One of the top

330

pathways dysregulated in Inf iMg compared to Uninf was the EIF2 pathway (Figures 6b). EIF2

331

signaling is involved in the UPR and, more broadly, the ISR (Cui, Li, Ron, & Sha, 2011; Janssens,

332

Pulendran, & Lambrecht, 2014; Walter & Ron, 2011). The EIF2 pathway was not only dysregulated

333

in iMg, but also was consistently increased in the iAst and iNrn (Figure 6-figure supplement 1a

334

and 1b). However, only iMg had increased expression of ATF4, the downstream transcription

335

factor of the PERK arm of the ISR, which leads to increased cytokine production (Masuda,

336

Miyazaki-Anzai, Levi, Ting, & Miyazaki, 2013) in Uninf v Inf (Figure 5c). Previously, we have shown

337

that the PERK arm of the ISR is activated in neurons and astrocytes from human brain samples

338

with HAND (C. Akay et al., 2012; K. A. Lindl, Akay, Wang, White, & Jordan-Sciutto, 2007).

339
340

Infection+EFZ had distinct increased activation of RhoGDI and CD40 pathways

341

We next compared Uninf to Inf+EFZ, expecting to see a dampened immune response

342

compared to Inf. Many of the top affected pathways in Inf iMg were related to inflammation;

343

however, there does seem to be a stark difference between Inf iMg and Inf+EFZ iMg (Figures 6b

344

and 6d). The Inf+EFZ had a much milder inflammatory reaction, where RhoGDI and CD40 signaling

345

were the only upregulated pathways compared to Uninf iMg (Figure 6d and 6e). RhoGDI

346

negatively regulates Rac, which functions in multiple inflammation pathways (Wilkinson &

347

Landreth, 2006), and CD40 activates NF-κB signaling (D'Aversa et al., 2008; Homig-Holzel et al.,

348

2008). A milder inflammatory response corroborates well with lesser disease severity seen in

349

HAND patients who are taking ART (Saylor et al., 2016).

350

The scRNAseq data suggest the microglia were most affected by the infection ± EFZ, with

351

major changes to EIF2 signaling, inflammatory, oxidative damage, and phagocytic gene pathways.

352

However, the distinct activation of RhoGDI and CD40 in the Inf+EFZ condition suggests the

353

combination of Inf+EFZ creates a distinct effect. We thus further investigated the effects of

354

Inf+EFZ treatment compared to Inf and Uninf+EFZ treatment.

355
356

Inf+EFZ has an attenuated, but distinct inflammatory response compared to Inf and Uninf+EFZ

357

Inf iMg had increased activity in several inflammatory pathways including IL-6 signaling,

358

neuroinflammation signaling, and Fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytosis compared to Inf+EFZ

359

(Figure 6-figure supplement 2a and 2b), suggesting the Inf+EFZ had an overall lower immune

360

response. However, the EIF2 signaling pathway, part of the UPR, was lower in Inf iMg compared

361

to Inf+EFZ (Figure 6-figure supplement 2b).

362

We next compared Uninf+EFZ to Inf+EFZ (Figure 6-figure supplement 2c). EIF2 signaling

363

was increased in the Inf+EFZ iMg (Figure 6-figure supplement 2d), similar to the Inf and Inf+EFZ

364

comparison (Figure 6-figure supplement 2b). However, inflammatory pathways including

365

neuroinflammation and ROS/iNOS signaling were higher in Uninf+EFZ compared to Inf+EFZ iMg

366

(Figure 6-figure supplement 2d). Inf+EFZ iMg again had increased activation of the CD40 and

367

RhoGDI pathways (Figure 6-figure supplement 2d and 2e) compared to Uninf+EFZ, suggesting a

368

distinct inflammatory response with the combination of infection and EFZ treatment.

369

iAst had activation of the neuroinflammation and RhoGDI signaling pathways in Inf+EFZ

370

than Uninf+EFZ (Figure 7-figure supplement 1e). These results show a stark difference in

371

responses to EFZ treatment alone and EFZ treatment with infection, suggesting combinatorial

372

and probably interacting effects of infection and EFZ treatment.

381

Uninf+EFZ creates an inflammatory response similar to Inf

382

Inf+EFZ had a starkly different response than Uninf+EFZ. So, we further investigated the

383

effect of EFZ treatment alone compared to Uninf and Inf treatments. ART can be used as a

384

preemptive treatment against HIV infection; however, it has various inflammatory and

385

neurotoxic side effects (Cagla Akay et al., 2014; Robertson, Liner, & Meeker, 2012). How ART

386

affects different cell types in co-culture has not been explored. We compared Uninf+EFZ to the

387

Uninf (Figures 7a, 7b, and Figure 7-figure supplement 1a and 1b) and Inf (Figures 7c, 7d, Figure

388

7-figure supplement 1c and 1d) and found a surprisingly similar gene expression profile to the Inf

389

condition, especially in the iMg and iAst. The pairwise comparison of Uninf and Uninf+EFZ

390

revealed multiple inflammatory pathways increased in Uninf+EFZ iMg, with neuroinflammation

391

signaling as the most activated pathway (Figure 7b). Several of the other pathways activated,

392

including IL-6 and IL-8 signaling, were also found in the Uninf v Inf comparison (Figure 6b). EIF2

393

signaling was increased in Uninf+EFZ iNrn compared to Uninf (Figure 7-figure supplement 1b),

394

similar to Inf iNrn (Figure 6-figure supplement 1b). EIF2 signaling was not increased in the iAst,

395

unlike in the Inf comparison, and there was a reversal for sirtuin signaling with inhibition in the

396

Uninf+EFZ versus Uninf (Figure 7-figure supplement 1a), suggesting Uninf+EFZ elicits a similar,

397

but not identical inflammatory response as Inf.

398

We found iMg had higher activation of neuroinflammation signaling and NRF2-mediated

399

oxidative stress response in Inf compared to Uninf+EFZ (Figures 7c and 7d). iNeurons had higher

400

oxidative phosphorylation activation; however, we found no statistically significant changes in

401

any canonical pathways in iAst between the conditions (Figure 7-figure supplement 1c and 1d),

402

suggesting an inflammatory response by iMg and change in mitochondria function in neurons in

403

response to HIV infection of the former.

404

Infection, EFZ treatment alone, and infection with EFZ treatment all induced distinct

405

responses not only across conditions, but also across cell types within conditions. These data

406

reveal a potential downside to pre-emptive ART use and suggest that the inflammatory response

407

from Infected to Inf+EFZ to Uninf+EFZ is not a linear regression as one might expect, but rather

408

three distinct responses. We further investigated these gene pathway changes by testing for

409

cytokine production and phagocytic abilities.

Synaptophagocytosis is impaired in Inf, Inf+EFZ iMg, and Uninf+EFZ iMg

424

We interrogated the ability of iMg to phagocytose synaptic material to further explore

425

the possible differences in the responses to infection ± EFZ and EFZ treatment alone. Fcγ receptor

426

mediated phagocytosis pathway was activated in the Inf iMg as well as the Uninf+EFZ iMg

427

compared to Uninf iMg (Figures 6b and 7b). Aberrant synaptophagy by microglia has been

428

implicated in multiple neurological disorders including Alzheimer’s and Frontotemporal

429

dementia (Hong et al., 2016; Lui et al., 2016). Many antiretrovirals, including Efavirenz, have

430

reported neurotoxic effects (Ciccarelli et al., 2011; Robertson et al., 2012) and reduce

431

phagocytosis (Giunta et al., 2011). In addition, HIV-infected macrophages and uninfected

432

macrophages exposed to HIV display decreased phagocytic capabilities, specifically through the

433

Fcγ receptor-mediated pathway and not complement, due to Nef and Tat inhibiting endocytosis

434

(Debaisieux et al., 2015; Giunta et al., 2008; Mazzolini et al., 2010), but human microglia

435

synaptophagocytosis has never been tested.

436

In order to determine their ability to phagocytose synapses, we generated tri-culture of

437

the iMg with the iNrn and iAst and examined them 14 days after adding the iMg (Figure 4a). The

438

cultures were subjected to immunofluorescence for IBA1, the lysosomal marker LAMP1, and the

439

pre-synaptic marker SYN1. We found colocalization of SYN1 in the LAMP1+ lysosomes of the iMg

440

(Figure 8a and 8b), suggesting that the iMg phagocytize synaptic material. We confirmed that

441

iMg are in contact with iNrns (Figure 8c), and importantly, only the iMg are infected as only they,

442

and not the iNrns (Figure 8d) or iAstrocytes, show P24 immunofluorescence. Additionally, RT

443

activity confirmed that the iMg in the infected condition remain productively infected (Figure 9a).

444

We were also able to delineate infected from uninfected iMg in the Inf+EFZ condition by multi-

445

nucleation (Figures 2c, 2d, and Figure 8-figure supplement 1a).

446

We utilized confocal imaging and 3D reconstruction to measure the total synaptic volume,

447

as indicated by synaptophysin immunofluorescence, within the iMg. The Inf iMg showed reduced

448

synaptophagocytosis compared to Uninf iMg. In addition, in the Inf+EFZ condition, the infected

449

(multinucleated) have reduced phagocytosis; however, the uninfected (single-nucleated) iMg in

450

the Inf+EFZ condition trended lower but was not statistically significant. Lastly, Uninf+EFZ

451

condition iMg also had impaired synaptophagocytosis (Figure 8e and 8f). Multiple factors from

452

the virus itself, the immune response, and the effects of antiretrovirals are acting on the iMg

453

during HIV infection. All these factors may play a role in reducing synaptic phagocytosis and

454

warrant future study.

455

While the Fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytosis pathway was activated in Inf iMg, several

456

of the genes dysregulated including: ACTB, ACTR3, ARPC2, FYB1, RAC1, and VASP (data not

457

shown), were associated with the nascent phagosome and phagosome formation, which is

458

targeted by Nef in impairing phagocytosis (Dirk et al., 2016; Mazzolini et al., 2010), suggesting a

459

compensatory increase in gene expression for genes associated with the target for Nef, early

460

endocytosis. This finding may partially explain the apparent paradox in increased pathway

461

activity of Fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytosis, but impaired phagocytosis in Inf iMg.

462

To confirm that differences in apparent iMg synaptophagy are not secondary to reduced

463

numbers of synapses overall in a given culture condition, we also measured local and random (50

464

µm radius areas with no iMg) synapse density to ensure the uninfected microglia were not in a

465

more synapse dense area (Figure 8-figure supplement 2a and 2b). In fact, there was no significant

466

difference in iMg-proximal or random synapse density across all conditions (Figure 8-figure

467

supplement 2c and 2d). This finding aligns with previous studies that demonstrate inhibition of

468

phagocytosis by viral proteins Tat and Nef in both infected and uninfected macrophages,

469

(Debaisieux et al., 2015; Giunta et al., 2008; Mazzolini et al., 2010), and is also consistent with

470

ART-related impairment of phagocytosis (Giunta et al., 2011).

all the groups (Figure 9b-9d). In addition, there was no increase in TNFa in the Inf tri-culture;

487

however, the Inf+EFZ condition did have increased TNFa (Figure 9d). The Inf and Inf+EFZ tri-

488

cultures also did not exhibit increases in IL-6 or IL-10, similar to our mono-culture findings (Figure

489

2-figure supplement 3c and 3d). These data combined with the scRNA data suggest there are

490

distinct influences on the inflammatory response during infection alone and infection with EFZ.

491

iMg in the Inf condition exclusively had increased expression of IL-8 and IL-1b genes (Figure 5c).

492

In addition, IL-8 and NF-κB signaling were activated only in iMg in the Inf condition by scRNAseq

493

(Figure 6b) Interestingly, TNFa regulates AP-1 (FOS) (Clark, Vagenas, Panesar, & Cope, 2005), a

494

CD40 signaling pathway gene that is upregulated in Inf+EFZ iMg when compared to the Uninf

495

(Figures 5c and 6d). These results further suggest distinct inflammatory reactions from Inf and

496

Inf+EFZ that are mostly caused by the iMg.

Discussion

498

We describe, to our knowledge, the first HiPSC tri-culture model to investigate the

499

interdependent and individual roles of microglia, astrocytes, and neurons in the context of HIV

500

infection. In recent years, there have been several new differentiation protocols for these cell

501

types (Abud et al., 2017; Santos et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2013) and several iPSC/primary cell co-

502

cultures that have studied various neurological disorders (Lin et al., 2018; Park et al., 2018). This

503

model goes one step further, exploring gene expression changes with scRNA sequencing in the

504

context of viral infection and relevant drug treatments to begin to unfurl a particularly difficult

505

disease to study.

506

Although there are missing components to this model, it is still able to recapitulate several

507

findings in vivo, such as increases in IL-8 and IL-1β production and EIF2 signaling (C. Akay et al.,

508

2012; Ginsberg et al., 2018; Tatro et al., 2014). It has also discovered novel changes that require

509

further investigation but could lead to advancements in therapeutics. This system allowed us to

510

identify sirtuin pathway dysregulation, which has been implicated in aging and Alzheimer’s, but

511

not HAND (Cho et al., 2015; Jesko, Wencel, Strosznajder, & Strosznajder, 2017).

512

We were also able to show that the microglia seem to be the main culprit in the initial

513

response to HIV infection; however, at least within the two-week period of this study, iMg

514

infection does not lead to aberrant phagocytosis of synapses. This falls in line with previously

515

reported impaired phagocytosis by HIV-infected or exposed macrophage (Debaisieux et al., 2015;

516

Mazzolini et al., 2010). With Nef and Tat targeting early stages of the phagocytosis, and most of

517

the genes dysregulated in the Fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytosis target early endocytosis, it is

518

likely that the increased pathway activation is a compensation mechanism. Infection with

519

HIVΔNef could confirm this.

520

In addition, we discovered a starkly different immune response at the gene and functional

521

level in Inf versus Inf+EFZ. CD40 and RhoGDI activation could be controlled by the increased

522

production of TNFa, that was only found in the Inf+EFZ condition. This persistent immune

523

activation highlights the need for further studies into the role that antiretrovirals play in

524

propagating the chronic inflammation seen in HIV patients today (Kolson, 2017; Saylor et al.,

525

2016). The mitigated reaction we observed with EFZ treatment is consistent with human studies

526

showing a reduced severity of HAND with the widespread use of antiretroviral therapies (Saylor

527

et al., 2016), but also with its persistence despite control of viral load. Further, we revealed a

528

substantial immune response to EFZ treatment alone. This warrants further study as people take

529

ART as a preventative measure (Spinner et al., 2016).

530

HiPSC cultures are particularly useful for studying HIV neuropathology, since human

531

primary neuronal cells and postmortem tissue are limited in availability and not amenable to

532

molecular manipulation. In addition, HIV only infects human cells, rendering the interpretation

533

of results from animal models more convoluted. Hence, mechanistic studies of the influences of

534

HIV and ART on human neural cells are limited. This tri-culture system allows us to better study

535

the mechanisms of early HIV infection in the brain; however, there are caveats to this system

536

that must be considered. Each of the iPSC-derived cell types are similar to their in vivo

537

counterparts by gene and protein expression, as well as, function, but are not exact. In addition,

538

the iCells’ gene expression profile at the end stage of differentiation is relatively immature and

539

more closely represents early stages of development in vivo. Our culture system allows

540

reductionist study of three key cell types over weeks but may be refined by inclusion of additional

541

cell types, and further optimization to model HAND in the adult setting.

542

This tri-culture has validated several findings in the field as well as produced multiple novel

543

findings for HIV neuropathology. However, this model is not restricted to HIV neuropathology

544

and can also be utilized to study other neurological disorders. This highly tractable, reductive

545

system can be genetically and pharmacologically modified at any stage. These differentiations

546

could also be used on patient-derived cells, creating a disease-relevant, patient-specific tri-

547

culture system. Similar cultures have been developed (Haenseler et al., 2017; Park et al., 2018),

548

but not to this complexity, as rapid a differentiation, or with a focus on viral infections. The tri-

549

culture can be another, instrumental tool in understanding the workings of complex neurological

550

disorders and in developing novel therapeutic strategies.

Materials and Methods

552

Human induced pluripotent stem cell lines

553

HiPSC lines for the iNrn and iAst were generously received from Herbert M. Lachman, MD.,

554

Einstein University, Bronx, New York. All lines were trained over to a feeder-free system with

555

Stem MACS iPS-Brew XF media (Miltenyi Biotec 130-104-368). Lines were tested for mycoplasma

556

using Lookout mycoplasma PCR detection kit (Sigma MP0035). iPSC lines for the iMg were

557

cultured by the Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Core (CHOP).

558
559

iNeuron differentiation of iPSCs

560

iPSCs were transfected with two plasmids VSVG.HIV.SIN.cPPT.CMV.mNgn2.WPRE and

561

VSVG.HIV.SIN.cPPT.CMV.rTTA.WPRE, produced by Marius Wernig (Stanford University) and

562

packaged by the University of Pennsylvania Viral Vector Core. Cells were exposed to 1ug/mL

563

polybrene (Sigma Aldrich TR-1003). Media is fully exchanged six hours after exposure. iPSCs are

564

differentiated according to a previously published method (Zhang et al., 2013). In brief, after

565

transfection, iPSCs were exposed to N2 media containing 5 mL N2 Supplement-B (Stemcell

566

Technologies 07156), 0.5mL 55mM β-mercaptoethanol (Life technologies 21985-023), 0.5mL

569

F12 (Gibco 11320-033) for 24 hours (DIV0). Cells were then exposed to puromycin (5ug/mL,

570

Sigma P9620) for 24 hours in the same N2 media (DIV1). iNeurons were re-plated 24 hours later

571

(DIV2) to experiment appropriate plates coated with Matrigel GFR (Corning 354230). Cells were

572

washed 2x in PBS and lifted with StemPro accutase (Thermo Fisher Scientific A11105-01) for 5min

573

at 37°C. Cells were spun down at 1000RPM for 5min at RT. Cells were resuspended and plated

iAstrocyte differentiation of iPSCs

582

iPSCs transfected with the NGN2 virus were put through the first two days of the iNeuron

583

differentiation. On day 3, cells were exposed to Astrocyte differentiation media: N2 media

584

(without BDNF, NT-3, laminin, and doxycycline), 10% FBS (Hyclone SH30071.03HI), B-27 with

585

vitamin-A (Thermo Fisher Scientific 17504044), FGF-2 (20ng/mL, R&D Systems 233-FB-025) and

586

EGF (20ng/mL, R&D Systems 236-EG-200). After 30 days, EGF was removed and FGF2 reduced to

587

5ng/mL. After 70 total days, cells were switched into Astrocyte Media (Sciencell 1801).

588

Experiments were performed after 90 total days of differentiation. After DIV90, iAstrocyte stocks

589

were frozen down.

590
591

iMicroglia differentiation of iPSCs

592

iPSCs were differentiated into common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) according to the published

593

protocol (Paluru et al., 2014) by the Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Core (CHOP). CMPs were plated

594

at 333K cells / well in a 24-well Cellbind plate (Corning 3337). CMPs were differentiated in iMg

595

media (RPMI 1640 media (GE Healthcare Life Sciences SH30027.01) with 10% FBS (Hyclone

596

SH30071.03HI), Recombinant Human IL-34 (100ng/mL, R&D systems 5265-IL-010), CSF-1

Human TGF-β1 (50ng/mL, Peprotech 100-21). Half media changes were performed every two

599

days for 11 days.

601

Tri-culture combination

602

iNeurons were differentiated as described above and re-plated on DIV2 to Matrigel (Corning

603

604

70k cells/well in iN media. On DIV5 of iNeuron differentiation, the iAstrocytes were added at 50k

605

cells/well. On DIV7 of iNeuron differentiation, iMicroglia were added at 100k cell/well. Cultures

606

were taken out to DIV21 of iNeuron differentiation. Of note, this preparation creates a “carpet-

607

culture” of the three cell types that is roughly 50um thick

609

Human astrocytes

610

Three separate donors for human astrocytes were obtained from Sciencell. Cells were plated on

611

PLL-coated plates (Sigma Aldrich P6282) and grown for two weeks in Astrocyte media (Sciencell

612

1801) and then RNA was extracted.

613
614

iAstrocyte cytokine exposure

615

iAstrocytes in mono-culture were exposed to IL-1b (R&D Systems 201-LB-005) or IL-8 (R&D

616

Systems 208-IL-010) at 10ng/mL or PBS vehicle control for 8 hours. Supernatants were collected

617

and sent for cytokine analysis.

619

HIV infection

620

iMicroglia were differentiated to D11. On D11, they were exposed to 50ng/mL of JAGO strain HIV

621

(UPenn Center of Aids Research; CFAR) for 24 hours. Media was fully exchange after 24 hours

622

and collected. Full media exchanges occur every 3 days for 15 days. If antiretroviral treatment

623

was used, it was started on day 6 of infection and added with each media exchange. Efavirenz

624

(U.S. Pharmacopeia 1234103) was used at 20nM and Darunavir (Prezista TMC114) at 4.5µM.

626

Monocyte-derived macrophage differentiation

627

We receive donated buffy coat from New York Blood Center from three donors (D471, D446,

628

D470). Buffy coat was diluted 1:1 with PBS (without Ca2+ and Mg2+) (Invitrogen 14190144). 15

629

mLs of Ficoll (Sigma Aldrich 26878-85-8) was added to 50mL conical tubes. 25mLs of Buffy

630

Coat/PBS was slowly layered onto the Ficoll. Samples were spun at 1200 rpm for 45 minutes with

631

no brake. The peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) layer was removed and placed into a

632

new 50mL conical tube, and the volume was brought up to 50mL with PBS. The PBMCs are spun

633

at 450Xg for 10 minutes. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet resuspended in 10mLs

634

of Red Blood Cell Lysis buffer (Sigma Aldrich 11814389001). Cells were shaking at RT for 10

635

minutes. Volume was brought up to 50mLs in PBS and spun at 450Xg for 10minutes. The

636

supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in DMEM with 10% FBS + Gentamicin

637

(Thermo Fisher Scientific 15750060). The PBMCs were plated on 6-well tissue culture plate for 5

Bulk RNA-seq

701

RNA was extracted using previously described with RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen 74104) and frozen at

702

-80°C. Samples were sent to the Center for Applied Genomics (CAG) for sequencing. In short, the

703

Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA library kit (Illumina RS-122-2201) for RNA-seq was utilized

704

for preparation of the libraries for sequencing. Libraries were produced using liquid handler

705

automation with the PerkinElmer Sciclone instrument. This procedure started with a ribosomal

706

RNA (rRNA) depletion step. The depletion step uses target-specific oligos with specialized rRNA

707

removal beads to remove both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial rRNA from the total

708

RNA. Following this purification, the RNA was fragmented using a brief, high-temperature

709

incubation. The fragmented RNA was then reverse transcribed into first-strand cDNA using

710

reverse transcriptase and random primers. Second strand cDNA was generated using DNA

711

Polymerase which was then used in a standard TruSeq Illumina-adapter based library

712

preparation. Library preparation consisted of four main steps: unique adapter-indexes were

713

ligated to the RNA fragments, AmpureXP bead purification occurred to remove small library

714

fragments, the libraries were enriched and amplified using PCR, and the libraries underwent a

715

final purification using AmpureXP beads. Upon completion, library quality was assessed using an

716

automated electrophoresis instrument, the PerkinElmer Labchip GX Touch, and qPCR using the

717

Kapa Library Quantification Kit and Viia7 real-time PCR instrument. Libraries were diluted to the

718

appropriate sequencer loading concentration and pooled accordingly to allow for the desired

719

sequencing depth. RNA libraries were sequenced in one lane of the Illumina HiSeq2500

720

sequencer using the High Output v4 chemistry and paired-end sequencing (2x100bp).

DPBS without Mg2+ and Ca2++0.04% BSA. Up to 20,000 cells were sent for sequencing per sample.

726

Samples were sent to CAG for sequencing.

728

Bulk RNA-seq analysis

729

RNA-seq reads were demultiplexed using the DRAGEN genome pipeline (Goyal et al., 2017).

730

FASTQ files were aligned to hg19 reference using the STAR (v.2.6.1) (Dobin et al., 2013) aligner

731

with default settings. Generated BAM files were read into the R statistical computing

732

environment. Gene counts were obtained using the GenomicAlignments package. Differential

733

expression analysis was performed using the R/Bioconductor package DESeq2 which uses a

734

negative binomial model (Love, Huber, & Anders, 2014). Analysis was performed using standard

735

parameters with the independent filtering function enabled to filter genes with low mean

736

normalized counts. The Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment was used to estimate the false discovery

737

rate (Padj) and correct for multiple testing. Genes were then analyzed using the Ingenuity IPA

738

software (QIAGEN Inc.). Additional published RNA-seq data was utilized for comparative analysis

739

from project accession SRP092075 (Abud et al., 2017). Datasets were obtained and converted to

740

fastq format using the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) tool provided by NCBI. Fastq-formatted data

741

was analyzed similarly to the bulk RNA-seq samples using the DRAGEN pipeline and integrated

742

into the experimental R data object.

743
744

Single Cell RNA-seq analysis

745

Next-generation sequencing libraries were prepared using the 10x Genomics Chromium Single

746

Cell 3’ Reagent kit v2 per manufacturer’s instructions. Libraries were uniquely indexed using the

747

Chromium i7 Sample Index Kit, pooled, and sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq sequencer in a

748

paired-end, single indexing run. Sequencing for each library targeted 20,000 mean reads per cell.

749

We had a mean of 39,227 reads per cell post-normalization with 2,165 median genes per cell.

750

Data was then processed using the Cellranger pipeline (10x genomics, v.3.0.2) for demultiplexing

751

and alignment of sequencing reads to the GRCh38 transcriptome and creation of feature-barcode

752

matrices. Individual single cell RNAseq libraries were aggregated using the cellranger aggr

753

pipeline. Libraries were normalized for sequencing depth across all libraries during aggregation.

754

Secondary analysis on the aggregated feature barcode matrix was performed using the Seurat

755

package (v.3.0) within the R computing environment. Briefly, cells expressing less than 200 or

756

more than 5000 genes were excluded from further analysis. Additionally, cells expressing >20%

757

mitochondrial genes were excluded from the dataset. Log normalization and scaling of features

758

in the dataset was performed prior to principal component dimensionality reduction, clustering,

759

and visualization using tSNE. Cell types were identified using expression of canonical cell markers

760

in microglia (AIF1, SPI1, CD4), neurons (MAP2, SYN1), and astrocytes (THBS1, SOX9). Differentially

761

expressed genes and identification of cluster or cell type specific markers were identified using a

762

wilcoxon rank sum test between two groups. P-value adjustment was performed using

763

bonferroni correction based on total number of genes in the aggregated dataset. Genes were

764

then analyzed using the Ingenuity IPA software (QIAGEN Inc.).

765
766

qRT-PCR

767

RNA was extracted by RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen 74104). cDNA was generated using SuperScript

768

VILO Master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific 11755050). RNA expression was measured using

769

Taqman

(Hs01881698_s1), TMEM119 (Hs01938722_u1), THBS1 (Hs00962908_m1), and GAPDH

771

(Hs02786624_g1). 30ng of cDNA was used per well, with three technical replicates per probe per

772

sample. qRT-PCR is run on an Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System. All

773

expression levels were normalized to GAPDH expression.
