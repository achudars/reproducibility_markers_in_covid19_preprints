Abstract

Introduction

Errorless chromosome segregation requires loadbearing attachments of the plus ends of spindle
microtubules to chromosome structures named
kinetochores. How these end-on kinetochore
attachments are established following initial lateral
contacts with the microtubule lattice is poorly
understood. Two microtubule-binding complexes, the
Ndc80 and Ska complexes, are important for efficient
end-on coupling and may function as a unit in this
process, but precise conditions for their interaction are
unknown. Here, we report that the Ska-Ndc80
interaction is phosphorylation-dependent and does not
require microtubules, applied force, or several
previously identified functional determinants including
the Ndc80-loop and the Ndc80-tail. Under force, Ska
stabilizes end-on microtubule attachments in parallel
with the Ndc80-tail, which we reveal to be essential for
end-tracking by Ndc80 multimers. Modulation of forcecoupling efficiency demonstrates that the duration of
stalled microtubule disassembly predicts whether a
microtubule is stabilized and rescued by the
kinetochore, likely reflecting a structural transition of
the microtubule end.

Correct attachment of chromosomes to spindle microtubules
during eukaryotic cell division allows daughter cells to inherit
the appropriate complement of chromosomes from their
mothers and is therefore essential for life. Macromolecular
structures named kinetochores generate physical links
between chromosomes and microtubules (Musacchio and
Desai, 2017). Kinetochores are built on specialized
chromosome loci known as centromeres, and consist of
centromere-proximal and centromere-distal layers of
interacting proteins, known as the inner and the outer
kinetochore. Within the latter, the 10-subunit Knl1-Mis12Ndc80 (KMN) network functions both as a microtubulecapturing interface and as a control hub for a cell cycle
checkpoint (spindle assembly checkpoint, SAC) that halts
cells in mitosis until the correct configuration of
chromosomes on the mitotic spindle (bi-orientation) has
been reached.
Upon entry into M-phase (mitosis or meiosis) and spindle
assembly, chromosomes are initially transported to the
spindle poles, where the microtubule density is highest, and
from there to the spindle’s equatorial plane, forming lateral
attachments to the microtubule lattice. CENP-E, a
kinetochore-localized, microtubule-plus-end-directed motor

plays an essential function in this process (Bancroft et al.,
2015; Barisic et al., 2014; Cai et al., 2009; Chakraborty et al.,
2019; Kapoor et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2008; Kitajima et al.,
2011; Magidson et al., 2011; Shrestha et al., 2017; Tanaka et
al., 2005). In a poorly understood process of “endconversion”, kinetochores engage the microtubule-binding
interface of the KMN network and transition from binding
to the lattice to binding to the dynamic plus ends of the
microtubules, which become embedded into the
kinetochore’s outer plate (Dong et al., 2007; Kuhn and
Dumont, 2017; McIntosh et al., 2013; Wan et al., 2009).
These so-called end-on attachments persist during
polymerization and depolymerization of the dynamic ends of
microtubules, and couple pulling forces produced by
depolymerizing microtubules to chromosome movement
(Akiyoshi et al., 2010; Grishchuk et al., 2005; Miller et al.,
2016; Powers et al., 2009; Volkov et al., 2018). Furthermore,
kinetochores control the dynamics of the plus ends, likely by
balancing the action of MCAK (kinesin-13, a microtubule
depolymerase) and Kif18 (kinesin 8, a microtubule stabilizer)
and possibly other plus end-associated proteins (Auckland
and McAinsh, 2015; Monda et al., 2017).
The molecular underpinnings of end-on attachment and
tracking by kinetochores, and hence of force-coupling,
remain unclear. However, two protein complexes, the Ndc80
and Ska complexes, have emerged for a prominent
involvement in this process (Figure 1A) (Auckland and
McAinsh, 2015; Monda and Cheeseman, 2018). The Ndc80
complex is part of the KMN network, which is stably bound
to kinetochores during mitosis (Cheeseman and Desai,
2008). The KMN is crucially required for end-on
microtubule attachment, and interference with its function
leads to severe defects in chromosome alignment and SAC
abrogation (Cheeseman et al., 2006; DeLuca et al., 2005;
DeLuca et al., 2006; Kim and Yu, 2015; McCleland et al.,
2003). In both humans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the four
subunits of Ndc80 (NDC80/HEC1, NUF2, SPC25, and
SPC24) have high coiled-coil content and form a ~60-nm
dumbbell structure in which highly elongated NDC80:NUF2
and SPC25:SPC24 sub-complexes meet in a tetramerization
domain (Figure 1B) (Ciferri et al., 2005; Ciferri et al., 2008;
Huis in 't Veld et al., 2016; Valverde et al., 2016; Wei et al.,
2005). At one end of Ndc80, two closely interacting
calponin-homology (CH) domains near the N-terminal ends
of NDC80 and NUF2 form a globular structure that binds
the microtubule. An ~80-residue basic tail preceding the
NDC80 CH domain (Ndc80-tail) has also been implicated in
microtubule binding, and phosphorylation by Aurora kinase
activity has been proposed to modulate electrostatic
interactions with the negatively charged MT lattice (Alushin
et al., 2012; Cheerambathur et al., 2017; Cheeseman et al.,

2002; Cheeseman et al., 2006; Ciferri et al., 2008; DeLuca et
al., 2006; DeLuca et al., 2011; DeLuca et al., 2018;
Guimaraes et al., 2008; Long et al., 2017; Miller et al., 2008;
Shrestha et al., 2017; Tooley et al., 2011; Umbreit et al., 2012;
Wei et al., 2007; Ye et al., 2015; Zaytsev et al., 2015; Zaytsev
et al., 2014).
At the opposite end of Ndc80, C-terminal RWD domains in
SPC25 and SPC24 mediate interactions with other
kinetochore subunits to dock Ndc80 complexes onto the rest
of the kinetochore (Musacchio and Desai, 2017). The coiledcoils flanking the globular domains form an apparently rigid
rod, with a distinctive hinge point coinciding with a ~38residue insertion (residues 427-464 of human NDC80,
Figure 1B), known as the Ndc80 loop (Ciferri et al., 2008;
Wei et al., 2005). The Ndc80 loop was proposed to be a site
of interaction for other microtubule-binding proteins, a
feature essential for end-on attachment and coupling to
microtubule dynamics, or a tension sensor (Hsu and Toda,
2011; Maure et al., 2011; Schmidt et al., 2012; Varma et al.,
2012; Wan et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2012).
The Ska complex is crucially required to stabilize
kinetochore-microtubule attachment (Auckland et al., 2017;
Daum et al., 2009; Gaitanos et al., 2009; Hanisch et al., 2006;
Ohta et al., 2010; Raaijmakers et al., 2009; Rines et al., 2008;
Sauer et al., 2005; Theis et al., 2009; Welburn et al., 2009). Its
three subunits (SKA1, SKA2, and SKA3) are paralogs that
interact through N-terminal coiled-coil segments and can
further oligomerize into a dimer of SKA123 trimers (Figure
1C) (Helgeson et al., 2018; Jeyaprakash et al., 2012;
Maciejowski et al., 2017; Schmidt et al., 2012; van Hooff et
al., 2017). Ska can target microtubules autonomously through
a microtubule-binding winged-helix-like domain in the Cterminal region of SKA1 (Abad et al., 2014; Schmidt et al.,
2012). Depending on the severity of depletion, ablation of
SKA results either in a metaphase-like arrest with weak
kinetochore fibres, reduced inter-kinetochore tension, and
SAC activation, or in a more dramatic alignment defect
similar in severity to that observed upon Ndc80 depletion,
despite lack of evident kinetochore damage (Daum et al.,
2009; Gaitanos et al., 2009; Hanisch et al., 2006; Ohta et al.,
2010; Raaijmakers et al., 2009; Rines et al., 2008; Sauer et al.,
2005; Theis et al., 2009; Welburn et al., 2009). However,
while Ndc80 is required for the SAC response (Kim and Yu,
2015; McCleland et al., 2003), Ska is not and its ablation
results in strong SAC activation, prolonged mitotic arrest,
and frequent cell death in mitosis. Ska is not present in all
eukaryotes, but an evolutionary distinct complex, Dam1,
usually performs an analogous, complementary function in
organisms devoid of Ska (van Hooff et al., 2017).

Biochemical reconstitutions and various biophysical analyses
have shed light into how Ndc80 and Ska contribute to
microtubule binding, end-coupling, and load-bearing. Ndc80
interacts with the microtubule lattice by introducing a “toe”
of the NDC80 CH domain into the interface between
tubulin monomers and by additionally harnessing the Nterminal tail to increase binding affinity (Alushin et al., 2012;
Alushin et al., 2010; Ciferri et al., 2008; DeLuca and
Musacchio, 2012; Sundin et al., 2011; Tooley et al., 2011; Wei
et al., 2007). Ndc80 has reduced binding affinity for features
attributed to depolymerizing microtubule ends, such as
curling protofilaments (Powers et al., 2009; Welburn et al.,
2009). On the contrary, intrinsic features of the MT-binding
domain of SKA1 allow it to interact preferentially with
curved protofilaments that likely mimic a depolymerizing
end (such as those obtained with certain microtubule
poisons), compared to baseline affinity to the microtubule
lattice (Abad et al., 2014; Maciejowski et al., 2017; Schmidt et
al., 2012). Individual Ndc80 complexes are unable to track
microtubule ends (Lampert et al., 2010; Powers et al., 2009;
Schmidt et al., 2012; Volkov et al., 2018), suggesting that
Ndc80 lacks intrinsic microtubule end-tracking properties,
but it acquires the end-tracking activity in the context of
multimerization (Powers et al., 2009; Volkov et al., 2018).
Ska, on the other hand, can track depolymerizing and
polymerizing plus ends as a dimer and possibly even as a
monomer (Helgeson et al., 2018; Monda et al., 2017; Schmidt
et al., 2012). Finally, both Ndc80 and Ska, each on their own,
can form load-bearing attachments to microtubules when
sparsely distributed on the surface of a bead trapped in an
optical tweezer (Helgeson et al., 2018; Powers et al., 2009).
Thus, Ndc80 and Ska have, each in their own right, features
expected of an end-coupler. Furthermore, these complexes
may physically interact and bind microtubules in
cooperation. First, Ska critically requires Ndc80 for
kinetochore recruitment and its kinetochore levels increase
after Ndc80-mediated end-on attachment (Chan et al., 2012;
Gaitanos et al., 2009; Hanisch et al., 2006; Raaijmakers et al.,
2009; Welburn et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2017). Second, Ska
complexes promote the tracking of Ndc80 of
depolymerizing microtubule ends in vitro, and appear to
increase the survival probability of attachments in vitro, both
in the absence and in the presence of load (Helgeson et al.,
2018; Powers et al., 2009; Schmidt et al., 2012). Importantly,
Ska loads on kinetochores that are already bound to
microtubules, and its kinetochore localization appears to be
negatively regulated by Aurora kinase activity (Chan et al.,
2012; Hanisch et al., 2006; Redli et al., 2016; Schmidt et al.,
2012; Sivakumar and Gorbsky, 2017). Collectively, these
observations have raised the interesting perspective that the

interaction of Ska and Ndc80 may be directly regulated by
force (Cheerambathur et al., 2017; Helgeson et al., 2018).
In the absence of assays exposing direct binding of Ska and
Ndc80, previous studies have focused on effects on
kinetochore recruitment after mutational perturbation of the
two complexes, or on effects caused by combining Ska and
Ndc80 on microtubules. For instance, the Ndc80 loop was
identified as a crucial enabler of Ska binding (Zhang et al.,
2012; Zhang et al., 2017). However, observations that Ska
may interact on microtubules with Ndc80bonsai, an engineered
Ndc80 that lacks the loop region (Ciferri et al., 2008), seems
inconsistent with this requirement (Janczyk et al., 2017). In
another study, the Ndc80 N-terminal tail was shown to
regulate the localization of Ska to kinetochores
(Cheerambathur et al., 2017). In yet another study, the Cterminal disordered region of SKA3 was shown to be
sufficient for a direct interaction with an NDC80:NUF2 subcomplex after phosphorylation in vitro by the Cdk1:Cyclin B
kinase complex (Zhang et al., 2017). This observation
requires further scrutiny, however, because other regions of
Ska, such as a “bridge” region (residues 92-132) of SKA1, are
required for kinetochore recruitment of Ska (Abad et al.,
2014). How phosphorylation regulates the interaction of Ska
with kinetochores, and specifically with Ndc80, thus remains
an important and unresolved question, not least because
recombinant Ska and Ndc80 seem to interact on
microtubules in the absence of phosphorylation (Helgeson et
al., 2018; Janczyk et al., 2017; Schmidt et al., 2012).
These fragmented and contradictory views may reflect
experimental conditions that fall short of capturing crucial
properties (e.g. composition, geometry, force-induced
conformational changes) of real kinetochore-microtubule
attachment sites. Here we identify, for the first time,
conditions for the physical interaction of homogeneous, fulllength recombinant Ska and Ndc80 in the absence of
microtubules or applied force, and discuss them in light of
previous work. The role of Aurora B in Ska recruitment is
more complex than hitherto believed, because its kinase
activity does not alter the interaction of the two complexes.
Experimenting with total internal reflection fluorescence
(TIRF) microscopy and optical tweezers, we harnessed our
reconstitution to dissect how the Ndc80:Ska interaction
affects microtubule end-tracking and force-coupling. We
demonstrate that Ska extends Ndc80-mediated stalls of
microtubule depolymerisation, often at higher stall forces,
and identify the duration of a force-induced stall as a
potentially crucial parameter in determining whether an endon bound microtubule will restore its growth. In contrast,
phosphorylation of the Ndc80-tail by Aurora B kinase
specifically
weakened
end-on
Ndc80-microtubule
attachments under force by shortening the stalls. Taken

complex. SKA1, SKA2, and SKA3 contain an N-terminal coiled coil (CC) region that mediates complex formation and dimerization. SKA1 contains a microtubule

understanding the molecular basis of kinetochoremicrotubule attachment.

We co-expressed human SKA1, SKA2, and SKA3 from a
single baculovirus in insect cells and purified the resulting
Ska complex using consecutive metal-affinity, ion-exchange,
and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). SEC-MALS
(multiangle light scattering) and SV-AUC (sedimentation
velocity-analytical ultracentrifugation) analyses identified
recombinant SKA as a dimer (Figure S1), in line with
previous reports (Helgeson et al., 2018; Jeyaprakash et al.,
2012; Maciejowski et al., 2017; Schmidt et al., 2012).
SKA3 is strongly phosphorylated in mitosis, and at least
three kinases, Aurora B, MPS1, and CDK1, have been
implicated in its phosphorylation (Chan et al., 2012; Gaitanos
et al., 2009; Maciejowski et al., 2017; Theis et al., 2009;
Zhang et al., 2017). Among these kinases, CDK1 appears to
have a prominent role, because its inhibition suppresses the
mitotic phosphorylation of Ska (Zhang et al., 2017).
Furthermore, CDK1 phosphorylation of a ~310-residue Cterminal extension of SKA3, predicted to be largely
intrinsically disordered and unstructured, has been proposed
to promote binding to Ndc80 (Zhang et al., 2017). To verify
these results, we phosphorylated Ska in vitro with
CDK1:Cyclin B. This resulted in a readily detectable shift of
the SKA3 subunit (Figure 1B). By mass spectrometry, we
identified twelve of the fourteen CDK consensus sites in the
C-terminal part of SKA3102-412 (SKA3C) as being
phosphorylated (Figure 1C and Table S1). These included
two threonine sites within a conserved TPTP358-361 sequence
whose phosphorylation was previously shown to be required
for kinetochore recruitment of the Ska complex (Zhang et
al., 2017) (Figure 1C). To test if the phosphorylation of Ska
impacts its binding to Ndc80, we mixed both purified
complexes at low micromolar concentrations and assessed
their interaction using SEC. Sortase-mediated replacement of
the C-terminal polyhistidine tag on SKA1 with a fluorescent
label permitted specific monitoring of Ska. This allowed us
to demonstrate that phosphorylated Ska, when mixed with
Ndc80, elutes earlier from a SEC column, indicative of
complex formation (Figure 1D, light and dark green traces).
Ska that had been treated with λ-phosphatase after
CDK1:Cyclin B treatment did not form a complex with
Ndc80, indicating that this interaction depends on the
phosphorylation of Ska by CDK1:Cyclin B (Figure 1D,

black traces). Consistent with multiple phosphosites in
SKA3C and the importance of phosphorylation for
Ska:Ndc80 binding, Ska lacking SKA3C did not bind Ndc80
(Figure 1E, orange traces). Collectively, these results
demonstrate, for the first time, a direct interaction between
full length Ndc80 and Ska complexes, and identify SKA3C
for being necessary for this interaction.
Alanine substitution of Thr358 and Thr360 in SKA3
prevented the recruitment of Ska to the kinetochore in vivo
(Zhang et al., 2017). Mutations T358A and T360A in SKA3
also prevented formation of the Ska:Ndc80 complex in vitro
(Figure 1F). Thus, effective phosphorylation by
CDK1:Cyclin B at other SKA3 sites, as judged by the
phosphorylation induced shift of SKA3 on SDS-PAGE, was
not sufficient to mediate Ska3:Ndc80 complex formation. It
has also been shown that two phospho-mimetic mutations,
T358D and T360D, are sufficient to promote robust Ska
kinetochore localization when twelve additional potential
phosphorylation target sites were mutated to alanine (Zhang
et al., 2017). However, neither unphosphorylated nor
phosphorylated Ska containing the T358D and T360D
mutations bound Ndc80 (Figure 1G), indicating that a single
negative charge at positions Thr358 and Thr360 cannot
functionally replace phosphate groups in our reconstituted
system. This contradicts previous results obtained with a
phosphorylated SKA3 fragment and a GST-NUF2:NDC80
sub-complex (Zhang et al., 2017). Taken together, our results
demonstrate the formation of a stable Ska:Ndc80 complex
and show that phosphorylation of Thr358 and Thr360 in
SKA3 by CDK1:Cyclin B is necessary for its formation.

Ska binds the NDC80:NUF2 coiled coil and the
Ndc80-loop is dispensable
We next set out to identify the Ndc80 regions that mediate
the interaction with Ska. Phosphorylated Ska did not bind to
an SPC24:SPC25 dimer, or to two engineered constructs,
named Ndc80dwarf and Ndc80bonsai, that lack large fragments
of the extensive coiled-coils in the Ndc80 subunits (Figure
2A, orange traces; Figure S1). The latter observation is at
odds with a previous report that identified an interaction
between Ska and Ndc80bonsai (Janczyk et al., 2017). In this
previous study Ska without phosphorylation, and Ndc80bonsai
had been incubated on microtubules, a condition that might
expose residual, low binding affinity. Collectively, our
observations suggested a potential requirement of the
NDC80:NUF2 coiled coil in Ska binding. To test this idea,
we generated Ndc80jubaea, an extended Ndc80bonsai analogue
that is also amenable to bacterial expression. Ndc80bonsai
contains a total of 17% of the coiled coil in all Ndc80
subunits, while Ndc80jubaea covers 66% of it. Importantly,

Ndc80jubaea bound phosphorylated Ska (Figure 2A, blue
traces). Collectively, these results demonstrate that
NDC80286-504:NUF2169-351 encompasses the Ska binding site,
and that the Ndc80 tetramerization domain is not required
for the interaction with Ska.
Previous analyses identified the Ndc80-loop (NDC80427-464)
as a prime candidate for Ska binding, because loop deletions
or sequence inversions prevent kinetochore recruitment of
Ska in vivo (Zhang et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2017). To address
the function of the Ndc80-loop directly, we designed, and
successfully expressed and purified, Ndc80 constructs with a
partially or entirely deleted loop region. To our surprise,
these “loopless” truncation constructs retained the ability to
form a complex with Ska (Figure 2D). This crucial
observation indicates that impaired recruitment of Ska to
kinetochores in cells expressing deleted or modified Ndc80loop sequences does not reflect impairments of the Ska
binding site, but rather a regulatory role of the Ndc80-loop
that enables Ska recruitment.

Structural characterization of the Ska:Ndc80 interaction
Both Ska and Ndc80 are elongated and contain flexible or
disordered fragments, a challenge for high-resolution
structural characterisation. Electron microscopy after lowangle metal shadowing visualized the highly characteristic,
~80 nm long, 8-subunit Ndc80:Mis12 subcomplex of the
KMN network (Figure 2E). However, while Ska was visible
with this technique despite its small size, no conspicuous or
characterizing structural features were revealed (Figure 2E).
Conjugation of a globular tetramer incorporating one
Traptavidin (T) (Chivers et al., 2010) and three Streptavidin
protomers (abbreviated as T1S3; 88-kDa) to C-terminally
biotinylated SKA1 (30 kDa) facilitated the recognition of
rotary-shadowed SKA1 and revealed Ska dimers with a ~10
nm separation between SKA1C and the N-terminal coiled
coils of SKA1, SKA2, and SKA3 that form the Ska
dimerization interface (Jeyaprakash et al., 2012) (Figure 2E
and Figure S2). The T1S3 labelling enabled us to localize Ska
bound to Ndc80:Mis12. A dimer of Ska bound a single
Ndc80:Mis12 without apparently inducing multimerization
of Ndc80. The position of SKA1T1S3 near the middle of
Ndc80 is consistent with the binding of SKA3 to the
NDC80:NUF2 coiled coil and highlights how the
microtubule-binding domains of the Ska dimer are
positioned relative to the CH-domains of NDC80:NUF2.
(Figure 2E).
To complement these low-resolution micrographs with a
proximity map, we determined potential contacts within the
Ska:Ndc80 complex using DSBU (disuccinimidyl dibutyric

urea) crosslinking followed by mass spectrometry (Pan et al.,
2018). The three datasets (Ska, Ska:Ndc80, and Ndc80)
contain a total of 233 unique intramolecular and 253 unique
intermolecular crosslinks (Figure 2F, Figure S2, and Table
S2). Despite our inability to distinguish the two copies of
each subunit in the Ska dimer, we can draw several
conclusions from the proximity maps. First, the extensive
contacts of the unstructured SKA3102-412 with the rest of Ska
largely disappear upon phosphorylation by CDK1:Cyclin B
and binding to Ndc80 (Figure 2F, blue crosslinks). In the
Ndc80-bound form, the phosphorylated SKA3C contacts the
NDC80:NUF2 coiled coil and appears to reach into the
portion of this coiled-coil that forms the tetramerization
domain (SKA3 residues 247, 254, 394, 399, 408, 410; Figure
2F, orange and green crosslinks). Second, the SKA1
microtubule-binding domain (MTBD) and SKA379 from at
least one of the Ska protomers are proximal to the Ndc80
tetramerization domain (Figure 2F, green crosslinks).
Deletion of the MTBD of SKA1 does not interfere with
Ska:Ndc80 binding (Figure S1), and these contacts do not
reflect an essential interaction between the SKA1MTBD and
Ndc80. Third, crosslinks between the unstructured Ndc80tail with various regions of Ndc80 and with SKA3399, 410
emphasize the flexibility of the entire complex and the
accessibility of the Ndc80-tail (Figure 2F, black crosslinks).
Taken together, this structural analysis combining low-angle
rotary shadowing and cross-linking/mass spectrometry
demonstrates that the NDC80:NUF2 coiled-coil harbours a
direct binding site for SKA3 that is phosphorylated at
Thr358 and Thr360, that the Ndc80-loop is dispensable for
Ska recruitment in vitro, and that at least one MTBD of
SKA1 in a Ska dimer is positioned near the Ndc80
tetramerization domain (Figure 2G).

Aurora B does not affect Ska:Ndc80 binding in vitro
In previous studies, Aurora B kinase activity has been shown
to counteract the recruitment of Ska to kinetochores. This
crucial observation appears to link the establishment of
robust microtubule attachment with the suppression of
Aurora B and the recruitment of SKA (Chan et al., 2012;
Janczyk et al., 2017; Sivakumar and Gorbsky, 2017). Aurora
B kinase phosphorylates the N-terminal tail of Ndc80 and
this weakens microtubule attachments (see Introduction).
While previous studies advocated a requirement of the
Ndc80-tail for kinetochore recruitment of SKA in vivo
(Cheerambathur et al., 2017; Janczyk et al., 2017), deletion of
the unstructured Ndc80-tail does not perturb binding of
phosphorylated Ska to Ndc80 in our reconstituted system

Figure 3 - Aurora B kinase activity does not disrupt Ska:Ndc80 binding
a) Full-length (fl) and tailless (Δ80) Ndc80 both bind phosphorylated Ska, as analyzed by SEC and SDS-PAGE. b) A Ska:Ndc80 complex was exposed to Aurora B
kinase or lambda-phosphatase. Low amounts of Ska:Ndc80 impair the detection of Ska by coomassie but fluorescent SKA1 was clearly detected. Deposphorylation
disrupted the Ska:Ndc80 complex but Aurora B phosphorylation did not. Kinase activity is indicated by the shift in elution volume of Aurora B treated Ndc80:Ska
and by the altered migration of phosphorylated NDC80 after gel filtration on the phostag SDS-PAGE. The asterisk marks Aurora B kinase.

(Figure 3A). This suggests that the Ndc80-tail, like the
Ndc80-loop, contributes indirectly to the recruitment of Ska
by establishing a proper kinetochore-microtubule interface
rather than by providing a docking site.
Aurora B also phosphorylates SKA1 and SKA3 on at least
seven consensus and non-consensus sites, including four in
the MTBD, but Aurora B phosphorylation has only small
effects on the interaction of Ska with microtubules in vitro
(Abad et al., 2014; Chan et al., 2012; Schmidt et al., 2012).
Furthermore, enhanced Ska recruitment to kinetochores
upon Aurora B inhibition is also observed when
microtubules are depolymerized (Chan et al., 2012; Janczyk
et al., 2017; Sivakumar and Gorbsky, 2017), arguing that
Aurora B does not control Ska recruitment to kinetochores
by modulating its binding affinity for microtubules.
We therefore asked if Aurora B controls the interaction of
Ska with Ndc80. Exposure of pre-formed Ska:Ndc80
complex to Aurora B did not affect the stability of the
Ska:Ndc80 complex. Aurora B activity was confirmed by a
shift in the elution volumes of Ndc80 and Ndc80:Ska from a
SEC column and by the altered migration of the NDC80
subunit in phostag SDS-PAGE (Kinoshita et al., 2009)
(Figure 3B, black and red traces). Conversely,
dephosphorylation of pre-formed Ska:Ndc80 complex by
lambda-phosphatase displaced Ska from Ndc80. Thus,
deletions of the Ndc80-tail or of the Ndc80-loop, and
Aurora B activity, all of which prevent kinetochore

recruitment of SKA in vivo, do not affect Ska:Ndc80 binding
in vitro. This suggests that Ska recruitment is licensed by
particular features of the kinetochore-microtubule interface
that signal successful bi-orientation.

Ndc80-

A single microtubule-binding site in the kinetochore contains
multiple closely spaced Ndc80 complexes, with recent
estimates converging on 6 to 8 complexes per attachment
site (Huis in 't Veld et al., 2016; Suzuki et al., 2015; Weir et
al., 2016). To address how physical clustering affects the
microtubule binding properties and other interactions of
Ndc80, we previously engineered an oligomerization module
allowing controlled binding of 1, 2, 3 or 4 Ndc80 complexes
(Volkov et al., 2018). We observed that multivalency has a
dramatic effect on the residence time of Ndc80 on
microtubules, increasing it by more than an order of
magnitude for every Ndc80 added (Volkov et al., 2018). In
force measurements with optical tweezers, sparse coating of
beads with multivalent Ndc80-modules resulted in more
efficient force-coupling than dense distributions of individual
Ndc80 complexes (Volkov et al., 2018).
Our present work indicates that clustering of Ndc80 is not
required to bind Ska in vitro, but we decided to investigate
possible effects of this interaction on Ndc80 clusters, as

these are likely to provide a more realistic representation of
the kinetochore distribution of Ndc80. As before, we
harnessed tetrameric T1S3-modules (like the one we used to
increase the size of Ska for visualization in rotary shadowing
experiments (Chivers et al., 2010)) to immobilize three
Ndc80 complexes onto the same particle (Figure 4A). T1S3[Ndc80]3 modules contain three Streptavidin subunits that
are covalently modified with fluorescent Ndc80, while the
available Traptavidin remains available for immobilization, if
needed.
We started by asking how Aurora B affects the plus end
binding properties of Ndc80 in the presence of Ska.
Phosphorylation of the Ndc80-tail tunes the affinity of
Ndc80 for microtubules in vitro and in vivo (see for instance
(Long et al., 2017; Zaytsev et al., 2015)). From a mechanistic
perspective, however, if and how phosphorylation of the
Ndc80-tail influences force-coupling with dynamic
microtubules is poorly understood. To address this, we
exposed trivalent Ndc80 modules to Aurora B kinase
activity. Efficient phosphorylation of the Ndc80-tail was
confirmed by a shift in SEC, mass spectrometry, and phostag
SDS-PAGE analysis (Figure 4B-C and Table S3). We
further assembled T1S3-[Ndc80]3 modules containing
NDC80Δ80, i.e. lacking the tail altogether. Consistent with
our previous observations (Volkov et al., 2018), trivalent
Ndc80 assemblies bound to the microtubule lattice for
minutes and efficiently followed depolymerizing microtubule
ends (Figure 4D). Remarkably, Aurora B phosphorylation
or truncation of the NDC80-tail did not influence the
residence time of T1S3-[Ndc80]3 on the microtubule lattice
(Figure 4D-E). Conversely, truncation of the Ndc80-tail,
but not its phosphorylation by Aurora B, prevented trivalent
Ndc80 from following the shortening ends of microtubules
(Figure 4E-F). Thus, these results identify the Ndc80-tail as
being crucial to attach Ndc80 to depolymerizing microtubule
ends. We conclude that trivalent Ndc80 modules bind the
microtubule lattice stably through their CH-domains, but rely
on the tails, regardless of their state of phosphorylation, to
remain attached to a shortening microtubule end in the
absence of a resisting force.
Previously, we used optical tweezers to study the ability of
reconstituted kinetochore particles immobilized on beads to
capture force generated by a depolymerizing microtubule.
We found that multivalent Ndc80 modules stall microtubule
depolymerization under microtubule-generated forces up to
5-6 pN (Volkov et al., 2018). These stalling events either
induced a rescue of microtubule growth or were followed by
an Ndc80-microtubule detachment event and continued
microtubule depolymerisation (Volkov et al., 2018).

Using a similar experimental setup, we compared T1S3[Ndc80]3 modules with unmodified, phosphorylated, or
truncated Ndc80-tails (Figure 4G). In the absence of an
independent way to resolve tubulin dynamics at the
microtubule end with high resolution, we assumed that every
detachment event was preceded by a stall and imposed a
lower limit of 2 milliseconds on the stall duration. Consistent
with the inability to tip-track shortening microtubules
(Figure 4C), tailless trivalent Ndc80 modules (NDC80Δ80)
dissociated rapidly from depolymerizing microtubules and
never rescued microtubule shortening (Figure 4H-I, orange
trace). Force-induced stalls by unphosphorylated Ndc80
modules were followed by microtubule regrowth in 21
events, and by detachment in 36 events (Figure 4H-I, blue
trace). In contrast, Ndc80 modules exposing a
phosphorylated tail detached from microtubule ends without
rescue in 20 of 21 events (Figure 4I, green trace). Thus,
Ndc80 modules phosphorylated by Aurora B detached from
shortening microtubule ends under force despite their ability
to tip-track depolymerizing microtubules without load
(Figure 4F). A closer inspection of the stalls generated by
modules with Aurora B-phosphorylated or truncated Ndc80
revealed a negative correlation between pulling force and
attachment time during stall (Figure 4I, green and orange
symbols). This correlation is expected for a typical
intermolecular bond. Unphosphorylated Ndc80 modules
behaved differently and remained bound to microtubule
ends independently of the force applied (Figure 4I, blue
symbols). In line with our previous analyses (Volkov et al.,
2018), there was a correlation between the force at stall and
the likelihood of a rescue (Fig 4I, Suppl. Figure 3). In
addition, in this and subsequent experiments described in
Figure 5, the duration of the stall emerged as an apparently
critical parameter in determining the likelihood of a rescue
after stall. Specifically, we did not observe rescues for stalls
that ended within ~1 second, even for high stall forces.
Rescues were only observed for longer stalls, albeit not as an
obligate outcome, because detachments were also observed
(Figure 4I).

Ska stabilizes end-on Ndc80-microtubule interactions
under force
Since trivalent Ndc80 modules are very efficient microtubule
tip-trackers by themselves (Figure 4F), we did not expect to
see much additional effect from adding Ska in the
depolymerizing-plus-end tracking assay. Thus, we added
fluorescently labelled Ska to flow chambers with dynamic
microtubules and trivalent Ndc80Δ80 modules, which are
instead very poor trackers. CDK1-phosphorylated Ska
associated, at subnanomolar concentrations, with Ndc80Δ80

trimers and promoted their movement with shortening
microtubule ends (Figure 5B-C). At concentrations of 1 or
10 nM, phosphorylated Ska effectively conferred tip-tracking
ability to the Ndc80Δ80 modules whereas dephosphorylated
Ska did not. Increasing the concentration of either
phosphorylated or dephosphorylated SkaC to 100 nM
conferred tip-tracking ability to trivalent Ndc80Δ80 modules
in both cases, reflecting low-affinity, phosphorylationindependent Ska:Ndc80 binding on a microtubule decorated
with Ska. The effect strictly depended on microtubule
binding by Ska, since addition of Ska lacking the SKA1MTBD
did not confer tip-tracking ability to trivalent Ndc80Δ80
modules (Figure 5C). These results demonstrate that upon
binding to Ndc80, Ska creates an additional microtubule endbinding site which enables tip-tracking of the Ndc80Δ80:Ska
complex (compare Figure 5B and 4D).
We next set out to test if the presence of Ska influences
force-coupling and kinetochore-microtubule attachments.
For this purpose, we bound Ska to glass beads coated with
trivalent Ndc80 modules (Figure 5D). We then compared
the fluorescence of Ska and Ndc80 on beads. As expected,
phosphorylated Ska bound more strongly than nonphosphorylated Ska to multivalent Ndc80 on the beads,
while a Ska complex incorporating SKA3∆C failed to bind
(Figure 5E and Figure S3A). As real-time monitoring of the
presence or absence of Ska in the DIC-based opticaltweezers setup is not feasible, we included soluble Ska at a
concentration of 100 nM to the flow chambers in force
experiments to ensure saturation of Ndc80 binding sites on
the beads. As shown in Figure 5B, at this concentration Ska
associates with the microtubule lattice. Furthermore, and in
agreement with our TIRF microscopy observations (Figure
5B-C), at these high Ska concentrations, phosphorylated and
unphosphorylated Ska behaved indistinguishably in force
measurements (Figure S3B). In our comparison of the
effects on force-coupling deriving from the presence or
absence of Ska, we therefore pooled observations from both
forms of Ska.
At all force levels, stalls were typically longer in the presence
of Ska (an example is shown in Figure 5F), independently of
the Ndc80-tail construct used (Figure 5G-I). While stalls for
intact unphosphorylated Ndc80 in absence of Ska were
limited to 5 seconds (in 56 of 57 cases, Figure 4I), stall
durations for the intact Ndc80 in presence of Ska exceeded 5
seconds in 17 out of 40 cases (Figure 5G and Figure S3).
We also observed a fraction of beads coated with
unphosphorylated Ndc80 that stalled microtubules at forces
reaching ~10 pN, exceeding the limit of 6 pN observed in
absence of Ska (Figure 5G). The ability of Ska to stabilize
the microtubule binding of Ndc80 under force strictly

depended on the microtubule binding domain of SKA1
(Figure S3C). Importantly, Ska reversed the negative
correlation between the force at stall and its duration for
trivalent Ndc80 modules with phosphorylated or deleted
Ndc80-tails (Figure 5H-I). Consequently, under these
conditions, the duration of stalls frequently reached values
(>1 s) that were almost never observed for these Ndc80
constructs without Ska (Figure 4I). This, in turn, correlated
with a large increase in the fraction of microtubules
undergoing rescue during stall (Figure 5H-I).
In some cases, the presence of Ska resulted in force-induced
stalls that persisted for tens of seconds and were deliberately
ended by increasing the stiffness of the trap and detach the
Ndc80-coated bead from the microtubule end. After bead
detachment, these microtubules failed to undergo rescue or
disassembly, as if they obtained a hyper-stable, frozen state
during the stall. This condition was apparently independent
of Ska:Ndc80 interactions, because it was observed in
presence of 100 nM soluble Ska independently of its
phosphorylation state and even with Ska lacking the SKA3C.
These hyper-stable microtubules were only observed when
Ska and an unphosphorylated Ndc80-tail were combined (7
out of 57 events; Figure S3B-D), suggesting that Ska
decorates and stabilizes microtubule ends undergoing forceinduced stalling with contributions of the Ndc80-tail (Figure
5G, Figure S3B-D).

Discussion
Kinetochore recruitment of Ska is a late mitotic event that
signals the completion of bi-orientation and the
establishment of kinetochore tension (Auckland et al., 2017;
Chan et al., 2012; Gaitanos et al., 2009; Hanisch et al., 2006;
Raaijmakers et al., 2009; Welburn et al., 2009; Zhang et al.,
2017). The precise molecular requirements for kinetochore
recruitment of Ska, however, had not been identified,
motivating the present analysis. To shed light on this
mechanism, we developed assays that, for the first time,
allowed us to identify and dissect a direct interaction of the
full-length versions of these complexes. We conclude that 1)
the direct interaction of Ska and Ndc80 requires CDK1mediated phosphorylation of SKA3; 2) phosphomimetic
mutants of residues 358 and 360 of SKA3 are insufficient to
bypass the requirement for CDK1; 3) the NDC80:NUF2
coiled-coils, but not the Ndc80-tail or -loop, are necessary
for the interaction.
Our conclusions partly agree with a previous analysis
showing that CDK1-mediated phosphorylation of the Cterminal region of SKA3 is important for Ska:Ndc80 binding
(Zhang et al., 2017). Similarly to that study, we find that

Ndc80bonsai does not bind Ska, an observation that
contradicts another recent report (Janczyk et al., 2017). On
the other hand, Zhang and co-workers (2017) concluded that
Ska interacts with the Ndc80-loop, which is required for Ska
recruitment in vivo (Zhang et al., 2012). We show here that
both the Ndc80-loop and the Ndc80-tail, another Ndc80
region previously implicated in the interaction with Ska
(Cheerambathur et al., 2017), are dispensable for the
Ska:Ndc80 interaction. Instead, Ska interacts primarily with
the coiled-coils of NDC80:NUF2 (Figure 2G). Thus, Ska
may fail to bind Ndc80bonsai because the latter lacks most of
the Ndc80 coiled-coils. The role of the Ndc80 coiled-coils in
Ska binding agrees with a recent report in which the
interaction of Ska and Ndc80 had been studied in the
absence of phosphorylation (i.e. under conditions where the
two complexes do not interact in solution) but in presence of
microtubules (Helgeson et al., 2018). While these
observations suggest that microtubules facilitate an
interaction of unphosphorylated Ska and Ndc80,
microtubule binding is not a strict requirement for
kinetochore localization of Ska, as the latter localizes to KTs,
but not to spindle MTs, also upon deletion of the SKA1
microtubule-binding domain (Abad et al., 2014; Schmidt et
al., 2012).
Importantly, our demonstration that Ska interacts directly
and robustly with Ndc80 in the absence of tension does not
support the idea that microtubule-generated tension exposes
an otherwise cryptic binding site for Ska on Ndc80
(Cheerambathur et al., 2017). Robust kinetochore
localization of Ska in cells with depolymerized microtubules
when Aurora B is inhibited also argues against a direct role
of force in Ska:Ndc80 interaction (Chan et al., 2012; Redli et
al., 2016; Sivakumar and Gorbsky, 2017). Aurora B kinase is
believed to be exquisitely sensitive to kinetochore tension,
and these observations renew the interest in the mechanisms
allowing it to control Ska localization (Krenn and Musacchio,
2015). We show in vitro that Aurora B activity does not
hamper the Ska:Ndc80 interaction, despite successful
phosphorylation of Ska and Ndc80, suggesting that Aurora B
plays an indirect role on the Ska:Ndc80 interaction. It is
notable that another condition shown to prevent biorientation, the deletion of the Ndc80-loop, also prevents
Ska recruitment to kinetochores without disrupting the
potential for this interaction in vitro. Collectively, these
observations point to the Ndc80:Ska interaction as a crucial
node of tension sensing in the kinetochore, and future
studies will have to address the mechanistic basis of this
phenomenon, including the exact role of Aurora B and of
the postulated feedback mechanisms identifying Ska as an
Aurora B activator (Redli et al., 2016), possibly through
interactions with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) (Janczyk et al.,

2017; Schmidt et al., 2012; Sivakumar and Gorbsky, 2017;
Sivakumar et al., 2016; Welburn et al., 2009).
With the demonstration that Ska and Ndc80 interact directly
in a single complex, a crucial question is how this interaction
affects the kinetochore-microtubule interface (Figure 6A).
In previous studies, Ska (without phosphorylation) was
shown to promote the ability of Ndc80 to track the
depolymerizing ends of microtubules (Helgeson et al., 2018;
Schmidt et al., 2012). The significance of this observation,
however, is partly unclear, because Ndc80 can track
depolymerizing ends of microtubules when part of an
oligomer, its normal condition within kinetochores (Powers
et al., 2009; Volkov et al., 2018). Furthermore, either
complex has been shown to be able to form load-bearing
attachments to microtubules in isolation (Helgeson et al.,
2018; Powers et al., 2009; Tien et al., 2010; Volkov et al.,
2018). When added to Ndc80, Ska was shown to increase the
survival probability of Ndc80 connections with
microtubules, but independently of applied force, an effect
likely reflecting lattice stabilization at high Ska concentrations
rather than the direct interaction of Ska and Ndc80
(Helgeson et al., 2018).
An ongoing challenge for in vitro studies is to investigate the
kinetochore-microtubule interface as a unit, using systems
that approximate stoichiometry, composition, and regulation
of real attachment sites. Here, after identifying conditions
that promote Ska:Ndc80 binding, we combined
phosphorylated Ska to Ndc80 trimers that we have
previously characterized as microtubule end trackers and
good force couplers (Volkov et al., 2018). An original
conclusion of our studies is that, after oligomerization of
Ndc80, the NDC80 N-terminal tail is dispensable for robust
binding to the microtubule lattice but is required for tracking
a depolymerizing microtubule end in the absence of force.
Deletion of the Ndc80-tail or its phosphorylation by Aurora
B impaired the ability of Ndc80 to stall and rescue
microtubule shortening and promoted detachment from
microtubule ends under force.
End-on attachments in vitro can stall microtubule
depolymerization in a force-dependent manner and trigger a
switch to a growing state. In case of unphosphorylated
Ndc80 complexes, rescue events were more likely for high
stalling forces, as reported previously (Volkov et al., 2018).
Here, we discovered that such rescue events only occurred
after stall duration reached a threshold of approximately ~1
second (Figure 4I). This temporal threshold appeared to
persist in the presence of Ska, whereas forces required to
produce rescue events in the presence of Ska varied widely
(Figure 6B). Binning of data obtained with the entire range
of tested Ndc80 and Ska complexes readily revealed stall

The fraction of rescues was plotted against
stall duration after pooling and binning of all
data. Detachment is more likely in the absence
of Ska and when the Ndc80-tail is
phosphorylated. An unphosphorylated Ndc80tail and the presence of Ska decrease
microtubule detachment and increase the
fraction of force-induced microtubule rescues.

duration as a good indicator for the binary outcome of a
force-induced stall (detachment or rescue) (Figure 6C). We
therefore speculate that the threshold of ~1 second reflects a
general property of a force-induced switch from a
depolymerization to polymerization, possibly the time
needed to stabilize protofilaments mechanically and assemble
a growth-supportive GTP-tubulin cap (Figure 6D). The
presence of Ska increased the overall duration of
microtubule stalls and stabilized microtubule plus-ends. We
speculate that, in our experimental setup and in vivo, Ska
stabilizes kinetochore-proximal protofilaments in a forcedependent manner. Although many molecular details remain
unclear, the idea that Ska both requires and promotes forcecoupling at the kinetochore-microtubule interface is
consistent with gradual and tension-dependent recruitment
of Ska to kinetochores during chromosome congression
(Auckland et al., 2017). Kinetochore-microtubule
interactions need to be reversible in the absence of tension
and stabilized upon bi-orientation. Although the
reconstitution of a bona fide tension-sensitive kinetochoremicrotubule interface requires additional components and
remains a long-term goal, our data in the absence of Ska
recapitulate
tension-stabilized
kinetochore-microtubule
attachments. These results establish the N-terminal tail of
Ndc80 as a crucial force-coupling element, demonstrate that

phosphorylation of the Ndc80-tail by Aurora B ensures
reversible and tension-sensitive kinetochore-microtubule
interactions, and provide mechanistic insight into the welldescribed in vivo effects of mutations that mimic
constitutively phosphorylated or unphosphorylated Ndc80tails. How phosphorylation of the Ndc80-tail and Ska levels
at the kinetochore are tuned in a tension-sensitive manner
and whether phosphatases play a role remain open questions
of great interest.

Materials and Methods

Expression and purification of Ska
Expression cassettes from pLIB vectors containing SKA1SORT-HIS,
SKA2, and SKA3 were combined on a pBIG1 vector using Gibson
assembly as described (Weissmann et al., 2016). See the tools and
reagents table for the different constructs used. Baculoviruses were
generated in Sf9 insect cells and used for protein expression in
Tnao38 insect cells. Between 60 and 72 hours post-infection, cells
were washed in PBS (10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4, 2.7 mM
KCl, 137 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) and stored at -80 °C. All subsequent
steps were performed on ice or at 4 °C. Cells were thawed and
resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM
NaCl, 10% v/v glycerol, 2 mM TCEP, 20 mM imidazole, 0.5 mM
PMSF, and protease-inhibitor mix HP Plus (Serva)), lysed by
sonication, and cleared by centrifugation at 108,000g for 60
minutes. The cleared lysate was filtered (0.8 µM) and applied to 5 or
10 ml HisTrap FF (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in washing buffer
(20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10% v/v glycerol, 1 mM
TCEP, 20 mM imidazole), washed with ca. 35 column volumes, and
eluted with 2 column volumes of elution buffer (washing buffer
with 400 mM imidazole). Relevant fractions were pooled, diluted 5fold with buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 30 mM NaCl, 5% v/v
glycerol, 1 mM TCEP) and applied to a 25 ml Source15Q (GE
Healthcare) strong anion exchange column equilibrated in buffer A.
Bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 30 mM to
500 mM NaCl in 180 ml. Relevant fractions were concentrated in
10 kDa molecular mass cut-off Amicon concentrators (Millipore)

equilibrated in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5% v/v
glycerol, 1 mM TCEP. Relevant fractions were pooled,
concentrated, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C.
Ska complexes with deletions or point mutations were purified in
the same way.

Expression and purification of Ndc80dwarf, Ndc80jubaea,
Ndc80bonsai, and SPC24/25
E. coli BL21(DE3)-Codon-plus-RIPL cells containing the
Ndc80dwarf or Ndc80jubaeae pGEX-6P-2rbs vector were grown at
37°C in Terrific Broth in the presence of Chloramphenicol and
Ampicillin to an OD600 of ~0.8. Protein expression was induced
by the addition of 0.4 mM IPTG and cells were incubated ~14 hr at
18°C. Cells were washed in PBS and pellets were stored at -20 °C or
-80 °C. All subsequent steps were performed on ice or at 4 °C. Cells
were thawed and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH
8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 10% v/v glycerol, 2 mM TCEP, 1 mM EDTA,
0.5 mM PMSF, protease-inhibitor mix HP Plus (Serva)), lysed by
sonication and cleared by centrifugation at 75,600 or 108,000g for
60 minutes. The cleared lysate was bound to Glutathion-Agarose
resin (3 ml resin for 5L expression culture, Serva) equilibrated in
washing buffer (lysis buffer without protease inhibitors). The beads
were washed extensively and protein was cleaved of the beads by
overnight cleavage with 3C PreScission protease (generated inhouse). The eluate was concentrated using 30 kDa molecular mass
cut-off Amicon concentrators (Millipore) and applied to a Superdex
200 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 50 mM Hepes,
pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 2 mM TCEP, 5% v/v glycerol. Relevant
fractions were pooled, concentrated, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen,
and stored at -80 °C. Nuf2 Val15 was mutated to Met in
Ndc80jubaeae. Ndc80bonsai and SPC24/25 were expressed and purified
in a similar fashion as described previously (Ciferri et al., 2005;
Ciferri et al., 2008).
Expression and purification of Ndc80full-length
Expression cassettes from pLIB vectors containing NDC80, NUF2,
SPC25HIS, SPC25SORT-HIS, SPC24, and SPC24SPY were combined on
a pBIG1 vector using Gibson assembly as described (Volkov et al.,
2018; Weissmann et al., 2016). See the tools and reagents table for
the different constructs used. Baculoviruses were generated in Sf9
insect cells and used for protein expression in Tnao38 insect cells.
Between 60 and 72 hours post-infection, cells were washed in PBS
and stored at -80 °C. All subsequent steps were performed on ice or
at 4 °C. Cells were thawed and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM
Hepes, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 10% v/v glycerol, 2 mM TCEP, 20
mM imidazole, 0.5 mM PMSF, protease-inhibitor mix HP Plus
(Serva)), lysed by sonication and cleared by centrifugation at
108,000g for 60 minutes. The cleared lysate was filtered (0.8 µM)
and applied to a 10 ml HisTrap FF (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in
washing buffer (lysis buffer without protease inhibitors). The
column was washed with approximately 35 column volumes of
washing buffer and bound proteins were eluted with elution buffer
(washing buffer containing 300 mM imidazole). Relevant fractions
were pooled, diluted 5-fold with buffer A (50 mM Hepes, pH 8.0,
25 mM NaCl, 5% v/v glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM TCEP) and
applied to a 25 ml Source15Q (GE Healthcare) strong anion
exchange column equilibrated in buffer A. Bound proteins were

equilibrated in 50 mM Hepes, pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 2 mM TCEP
(with or without 5% v/v glycerol). Size-exclusion chromatography
was performed under isocratic conditions at recommended flow
rates and relevant fractions were pooled, concentrated, flash-frozen
in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C.

Expression and purification of Aurora B and CDK1:Cyclin-B
kinases
E. Coli BL21(DE3)-Codon-plus-RIPL cells containing the pGEX6P-2rbs GST-Aurora B45-344:INCENP835-903 vector (Girdler et al.,
2008) were grown to an OD600 of approximately 0.4 at 25°C and
protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.1 mM IPTG
for ~14 hr at 20°C. All subsequent steps were performed on ice or
at 4 °C. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP, 1 mM EDTA, 1
mM PMSF), lysed by sonication, and cleared by centrifugation at
75,000g for 30 minutes. Cleared lysates were applied onto a 5 ml
GSH column (GE Healthcare), washed, and exposed overnight to
3C PreScission protease (generated in-house). After cleavage,
Aurora B45-344:INCENP835-903 was concentrated and applied to a
Superdex 200 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 25
mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP, 5% v/v
glycerol. Relevant fractions after size-exclusion chromatography
were pooled, concentrated, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and
stored at -80 °C.
CDK1:Cyclin-B was expressed and purified as described (Huis in ‘t
Veld et al., 2016). In brief, a pBIG1 vector containing codonoptimized GSTCDK1 and HISCyclin B1HIS was used to express
CDK1:Cyclin-B in Tnao38 insect cells. Cells were thawed and
resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl,
5% v/v glycerol, 2 mM TCEP, a bit of lypholized DNAse, 1 mM
PMSF), lysed by sonication and cleared by centrifugation. The
cleared lysate was filtered (0.8 µM) and applied to a 5 ml GSH
column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in washing buffer (lysis buffer
without DNAse and PMSF). The column was washed and bound
proteins were eluted using washing buffer containing 20 mM
glutathione. Relevant fractions were pooled, concentrated, and
applied to a Superdex 200 10/300 column (GE Healthcare)
equilibrated in 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 5% v/v
glycerol, 2 mM TCEP. Relevant fractions after size-exclusion
chromatography were pooled, concentrated, flash-frozen in liquid
nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C.
In vitro phosphorylation and fluorescent labeling
The C-terminal polyhistidine tag on SKA1 was replaced with a
fluorescent peptide in an overnight labeling reaction at 10 °C.
Sortase, Ska, and peptide were used in an approximate molar ratio
of 1:10:100. Ska complexes were exposed to Aurora B or
CDK1:Cyclin-B (with ATP and MgCl2) or lambda-phosphatase
(with MnCl2) during the Sortase labeling reaction or, in the case of
pre-formed Ska:Ndc80 complexes, in a separate reaction.
Phosphorylation was assessed using SDS-PAGE followed by ProQ
diamond stain (Thermo Fisher), Phostag-SDS-PAGE (Kinoshita et
al., 2009), and mass spectrometry (as described (Huis in 't Veld et
al., 2016)).

4°C using a AKTAmicro system (GE Healthcare) mounted with a
Superose 6 5/150 increase column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in
size-exclusion chromatography buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 200
mM NaCl, 2% v/v glycerol, and 2 mM TCEP) and operated at or
near the recommended flow rate. Typically, fractions of 80 µL were
collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The absorbance of
fluorescently labeled proteins was followed during chromatography
using the AKTAmicro Monitor UV-900 (GE Healthcare) and by
SDS-PAGE using a ChemiDoc MP system (Bio-Rad).
SEC-MALS
SEC-MALS was performed on a Dawn Heleos II System with an
Optilab T-rEX RI detector (Wyatt) and a 1260 Inifinity II LC
system (Agilent). The Superose 6 increase 10/300 column (GE
Healthcare) was pre-equilibrated with running buffer (50 mM
HEPES pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 10% Glycerol and 1mM
TCEP). Analysis was performed at room temperature with 100 µl
Ska complex that was pre-diluted in running buffer from 6.7 mg/ml
to 1 mg/ml.
Analytical ultracentrifugation
Sedimentation velocity AUC was performed at 42,000 rpm at 20°C
in a Beckman XL-A ultracentrifuge. Purified Ska complexes were
diluted to approximately 10 µM in a buffer containing 20 mM TrisHCl, 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM TCEP and loaded into standard
double-sector centerpieces. The cells were scanned at 280 nm every
minute and 500 scans were recorded for every sample. Data were
analyzed using the program SEDFIT (Schuck, 2000) with the model
of continuous c(s) distribution. The partial specific volumes of the
proteins, buffer density and buffer viscosity were estimated using
the program SEDNTERP. Data figures were generated using the
program GUSSI.
Crosslinking and Mass spectrometry
To prepare Ska:Ndc80 for analysis by crosslinking and mass
spectrometry, Ska was in vitro phosphorylated by CDK1:Cyclin-B
as described above, purified using size-exclusion chromatography
using a superose 6 increase 5/150 column (GE Healthcare) in
crosslinking buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 8, 250 mM NaCl, 5% v/v
glycerol, and 2 mM TCEP), and bound to Ndc80. Binding to
Ndc80 was confirmed using analytical size-exclusion
chromatography (see Supplementary Figure 2C). Approximately
100 µg of Ska, Ska:Ndc80 in crosslinking buffer were crosslinked by
DSBU using an in-house generated protocol described in detail in
Pan et al., 2018. The Ndc80 dataset was prepared in a similar way
(Pan et al., 2018). Proximity maps were visualized in circos plots
(Krzywinski et al., 2009) and arranged using Adobe Illustrator.
Alignments
Multiple species alignments of NDC80 and SKA3 were generated
using Clustal Omega (Sievers et al., 2011) and curated in Jalview 2
(Waterhouse et al., 2009).

GmbH). Specimens were mounted and dried in a MED020 highvacuum metal coater (Bal-tec). A Platinum layer of approximately 1
nm and a 7 nm Carbon support layer were evaporated subsequently
onto the rotating specimen at angles of 6-7° and 45° respectively.
Pt/C replicas were released from the mica on water, captured by
freshly glow-discharged 400-mesh Pd/Cu grids (Plano GmbH), and
visualized using a LaB6 equipped JEM-1400 transmission electron
microscope (JEOL) operated at 120 kV. Images were recorded at a
nominal magnification of 60,000x on a 4k x 4k CCD camera F416
(TVIPS), resulting in 0.18 nm per pixel. Particles were manually
selected using EMAN2 (Tang et al., 2007).

Assembly of TS-Ndc80 modules
T1S3 and T3S1 assemblies were assembled from Traptavidin (T;
addgene plasmid #26054) and Dead Streptavidin-SpyCatcher (S;
addgene plasmid # 59547). Both plasmids were kind gifts from
Mark Howarth (Chivers et al., 2010; Fairhead et al., 2014). T1S3[Ndc80]3 modules were prepared as described previously (Volkov et
al., 2018). In brief, a mixture of Ndc80 (or Ndc80Δ80) and T1S3 (1.8
µM) with an approximate 10-fold molar excess of Ndc80 was
incubated for 12-16 hours at 10 °C in the presence of protease
inhibitor mix (Serva). Sortase (4 µM) and GGGGKTMR (137 µM)
were included in the reaction to fluorescently label SPC25. In order
to phosphorylate Ndc80 (19 µM), CDK1:Cyclin-B (75 nM), Aurora
B (2.1 µM), ATP (1.25 mM) and MgCl2 (10 mM) were also included
in the overnight reaction. Reaction mixtures were applied to a
Superose 6 increase 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in
20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 2% v/v glycerol, 2 mM
TCEP. Relevant fractions were pooled and concentrated using 50
kDa molecular mass cut-off. Amicon concentrators (Millipore),
flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Efficient
phosphorylation of NDC80 was confirmed by mass spectrometry
and phostag-SDS-PAGE.

Tubulin and microtubules
Digoxigenin-labelled tubulin was produced by labelling homepurified porcine brain tubulin (Castoldi and Popov, 2003) according
to published protocols (Hyman et al., 1991). All other tubulins were
purchased from Cytoskeleton Inc. GMPCPP-stabilized seeds were
made by two rounds of polymerization in 25 µM tubulin (40% digtubulin) supplemented with 1 mM GMPCPP (Jena Biosciences) as
described (Volkov et al., 2018).
TIRF microscopy
Chamber preparation and microscopy were performed as described
(Volkov et al., 2018). In brief, both coverslips and slides were
cleaned in oxygen plasma, immediately silanized, and later
assembled in a chamber using double-sided tape. The chambers
were first incubated with ~0.2 µM anti-DIG antibody (Roche) and
passivated with 1% Pluronic F-127, followed by GMPCPP seeds
(diluted 1:200 – 1:1000) and then the reaction mix. The reaction
mix contained MRB80 buffer supplemented with 8 µM tubulin (46% labelled with HiLyte-488), 1 mM GTP, 1 mg/ml κ-casein,
0.01% methylcellulose, 4 mM DTT, 0.2 mg/ml catalase, 0.4 mg/ml
glucose oxidase and 20 mM glucose; this mix was centrifuged in
Beckman Airfuge for 5 min at 30 psi before adding to the chamber.
Imaging was performed at 30°C using Nikon Ti-E microscope
(Nikon) with the perfect focus system (Nikon) equipped with a Plan

Apo 100X 1.45NA TIRF oil-immersion objective (Nikon), iLas2
ring TIRF module (Roper Scientific) and a Evolve 512 EMCCD
camera (Roper Scientific). Images were acquired with MetaMorph
7.8 software (Molecular Devices). The final resolution was 0.16
µm/pixel. The objective was heated to 34°C by a custom-made
collar coupled with a thermostat, resulting in the flow chamber
being heated to 30°C. All images were analysed using Fiji
(Schindelin et al., 2012).
Preparation of beads for force measurement
1 µm glass COOH-functionalized beads (Bangs Laboratories) were
coated with PLL-PEG (Poly-L-lysine (20 kDa) grafted with
polyethyleneglycole (2 kDa), SuSoS AG) containing 1-10% PLLPEG-biotin, then saturated with T1S3-[Ndc80]3 modules as
described (Volkov et al., 2018). Coating density was determined for
each bead preparation, and bead preparations containing on average
100-1000 Ndc80 copies per bead were used for optical trapping.
This surface density was previously identified to be the optimal for
efficient coupling of microtubule-generated force and rescue of
shortening microtubules ends (Volkov et al., 2018). For
experiments shown in Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure 3, T1S3[Ndc80]3-coated beads were additionally incubated with 400 nM
SKA complex followed by extensive washing.
Flow chambers with GMPCPP-stabilized seeds were prepared as
described above, the reaction mix contained MRB80 buffer with
10-12 µM tubulin, 1 mM GTP, 1 mg/ml κ-casein, 4 mM DTT, 0.2
mg/ml catalase, 0.4 mg/ml glucose oxidase and 20 mM glucose.
This reaction mix was centrifuged in Beckman Airfuge for 5 min at
30 psi, and then supplemented with freshly prepared beads with or
without additional 100 nM of SKA complex.
Laser tweezers and experiments with the beads
DIC microscopy and laser tweezers experiments were performed as
described (Volkov et al., 2018). Images were captured using
QImaging Retiga Electro CCD cameras and MicroManager 1.4
software. At the start of each experiment 50 frames of bead-free
fields of view in the chamber were captured, averaged, and used
later for on-the-fly background correction. The images were
acquired at 8 frames per second, subjected to background
substraction and each 10 consecutive frames were averaged. The
signal from the quadrant photo-detector (QPD) signal was sampled
at 10 kHz without additional filtering. Experiments were performed
at 0.4-0.8W of the 1064 nm laser resulting in a typical trap stiffness
of 0.03-0.07 pN/nm. Trap stiffness was determined for each bead
after it detached from a microtubule. If a microtubule was stalled by
a bead for more than 90 s, the power of the trapping laser was
increased to 4W (corresponding to a typical trap stiffness of 0.4
pN/nm) and the bead was ruptured from the microtubule using
100 nM steps of the piezo stage. A typical force required to rupture
a bead from a microtubule exceeded 40 pN.
QPD traces were analysed in MatLab R2013b. Each force trace was
analysed manually and confirmed to correspond with a respective
DIC movie in both the time of force development and the direction
of microtubule. The stall force was determined as a difference
between the stall level and the free bead level along the microtubule
multiplied by trap stiffness, corrected for the nonlinear increase of
the force as a function of the distance from the trap centre
(Simmons et al., 1996).

Figure S1 - Ska forms a dimer of a heterotrimer and the formation of a Ska:Ndc80 complex does not require the Ndc80 tetramerization region or the
SKA1MTBD
a) SEC-MALS analysis reveals that Ska is predominantly a dimer of a heterotrimer at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Small amounts of monomeric Ska were
determined as monomeric (eluting ~16.5 ml) or multimeric (eltuting before the dimeric Ska). b) Sedimentation velocity AUC of Ska highlighted sample purity and
the dimeric and elongated nature of the complex. Truncation of the C-terminal region of SKA3 and the MTBD of SKA1 show that the N-terminal coiled-coils of
SKA1, SKA2, and SKA3 are sufficient for dimerization. c) Multiple species alignment of the region in SKA3 that has been implicated in the binding to Ndc80. The
P symbols mark residues that were phosphorylated by CDK1:Cyclin-B in vitro. The conservation analysis is part of track shown in Figure 1C. d) Ndc80, Ndc80dwarf, and Ndc80-dwarf in the presence of an excess of SPC24:SPC25 were tested for their ability to bind phosphorylated Ska. Ndc80-dwarf binds SPC24:SPC25
stoichiometrically. Phosphorylated Ska only binds to full-length Ndc80. e) An overview of all the Ndc80 constructs that were used. f) Deletion of the MTBD of
SKA1 does not interfere with the phosphorylayion dependent binding of Ska to Ndc80. All SKA subunit are visible in the input gel, but only the larger SKA3 is
visible by coomassie staining in the analysed fractions after size-exclusion chromatography. SKA1 was labelled with HiLyte-647 and could be followed specifically
during size-exclusion chromatography and through in-gel fluorescence.

Figure S2 - Sample preparation for electron microscopy and crosslinking mass spectrometry
a) The input for the preparative size-exclusion was analysed by SDS-PAGE followed by coomassie staining and in-gel fluorescence of SKA1. The samples were not
boiled prior to electrophoresis, and the T1S3 tetramer was not dissociated. The shift of SKA1TMR-biotin-T1S3 compared to SKA1TMR-biotin thus indicates successful and
near complete labelling of SKA1 with T1S3. Ndc80 (N), Mis12 (M), Ska, and T1S3 are shown for comparison. b) Size-exclusion chromatography was used to
separate the input sample shown in panel A. Fractions were analysed as indicated and labelled. Fractions indicated with A and B were analysed by electron
microscopy (see Figure 2E). c) A Ska:Ndc80 complex was prepared for chemical cross-linking. Complex formation was assessed with a fraction of the material prior
to the DSBU treatment. The near complete shift of Ska (light green) into a Ska:Ndc80 complex (dark green) is important to interpret the proximity map resulting
from the cross-linking mass spectrometry analysis.
