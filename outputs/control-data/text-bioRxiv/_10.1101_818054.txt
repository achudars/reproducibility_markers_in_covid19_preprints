Antagonistic activity of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subsp. amyloliquefaciens against multidrug
resistant Serratia rubidaea

Abstract
Serratia rubidaea a member of the Enterobacteriaceae family, is a Gram-negative opportunistic
pathogen, known to survive harsh environmental conditions and responsible for hospital associated
infections. Specifically, S. rubidaea can withstand desiccation and survive on hospital surfaces and
equipments as well as have acquired antimicrobial resistance determinants for different commercial
antibiotics. The expansion of this multidrug resistant pattern suggests that the treatment of S.
rubidaea infections will become increasingly difficult in near future. Although some measures were
taken to control this species, an inhibition mechanism is remaining unknown. To design effective
means to control the dissemination of S. rubidaea, an in-depth analysis is required. In the present
study, one possible candidate was isolated from the soil of Sundarban Mangroove Forest (Bangladesh)
that has important physiological effects to inhibit this pathogenic bacterium. The bacterial isolate was
initially

identified

as

Bacillus

amyloliquefaciens subsp. amyloliquefaciens

using

identification system and confirmed to be B. amyloliquefaciens strain through 16S rDNA sequence
analysis. The growth and antagonistic activity of this potential strain was shown to be stable under wide
range of pH, temperature and salinity (NaCl). Moreover, the novel B. amyloliquefaciens isolate can also
inhibit Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other pathogenic
bacteria. These results suggest that B. amyloliquefaciens might have potential antimicrobial properties
and further research is required for future use of this bacterium as biological controls of S. rubidaea or
development as new drugs for pathogenic bacteria.

Introduction

The genus Serratia rubidaea is gram-negative speculator pathogens, known to survive harsh
environmental surroundings and is a leading cause of hospital acquired infections. This species was
first described as Bacterium rubidaea in 1940 and presently recognized as S. rubidaea [1]. Serratias
are widely distributed saprophytic bacterium and has been found in soil, air, water as well as plants.

This bacterium is usually responsible for human opportunistic infections [2]. It can cause infections in
severely ill patients receiving broad-spectrum antimicrobials or those that have undergone surgery or
other invasive procedures including sepsis, bacteremia, urinary tract infections (UTIs), wound and
pulmonary infections [3, 4]. Treatment of S. rubidaea infection is often complicated by multidrugresistant phenotypes. This species has essential resistance to several antimicrobial groups, including
some classes of beta-lactams and tetracyclines [1, 2, 5]. The expansion of this multidrug resistant
pattern suggests that the treatment of S. rubidaea infections will become increasingly difficult in the
future. At present, spreading of antibiotic resistant bacteria is becoming a major public health problem
in all over the world [6, 7]. So here is an urgent need to search new compounds or the sources of new
compounds to control S. rubidaea. Although some measures were taken to clinically control this
species, except an inhibition mechanism is remaining unknown.
Biological control by using antagonistic bacteria is widely expected to become an alternative method
for the prevention and control of bacterial diseases. Microbial antagonism is a biological process in
which certain microorganisms suppresses the growth of other microorganisms through competition for
nutrients or secreting the inhibitory substances [8, 9]. In an antagonistic relationship, several
microorganisms can indirectly inhibit other microorganisms or reduce their growth by changing pH,
osmotic pressure and surface tension. In another way, a number of microorganisms can directly restrain
other microorganisms through producing bacteriocin, antibiotic, toxic components and/or antimicrobial
substances [10, 11]. Numerous studies have suggested that these substances are typically antimicrobial
proteins or peptides that inhibit the growth of sensitive bacterium or execute them by interfering with
the synthesis of cell wall or by forming pores in the cell membrane [12-14]. In a study, J.G. Burgess et
al reported about 35% of surface-associated bacteria of Scottish coastal seaweed and invertebrate
species that produce antimicrobial compounds [15]. Furthermore, Hans-Peter Grossart et al., also
reported about several isolates from the Southern Californian Bight that showed antagonistic activity
towards other bacteria [16]. In recent years, many studies have been emerged the antimicrobial
properties of the genus Bacillus. The Gram positive, aerobic, rod-shaped endospore forming bacteria of
the genus Bacillus are most notably produced antimicrobial substances as secondary metabolites [17].
Shelar et al., determined that antimicrobial substances produced by Bacillus atrophaeus JS-2 showed
antagonistic activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms [18]. The Gram
positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis is a vital producer of industrial enzymes and can also able to

demonstrate antagonism behavior to other bacteria. Recently, Das et.al., isolates one novel Bacillus
subtilis AN11 strain from Bhitarkanika mangrove forest, Odisha, India that have strong antagonistic
activity against major fish bacterial pathogens [8]. These observations suggest the involvement of
Bacillus genus in responses to pathogen resistance processes.
Bacillus amyloliquefaciens is a non-pathogenic soil bacteria closely related to the species B. subtilis
[19]. This bacterium is gram positive rods along with peritrichous flagella consent to motility. The cells
often appear as long chains unlike many other Bacillus species that form as single cells. Similar to
other Bacillus species, B. amyloliquefaciens forms endospores allowing continued existence for a long
time period. Endospores appear centrally in the cells which do not have a swollen appearance [20, 21].
This species have impressive capacity to synthesize non ribosomal secondary metabolites with
antimicrobial activity [22, 23]. On the basis of phylogenic analysis and physiological characteristics,
recently B. amyloliquefaciens divided in to two sub species: the plant associated B. amyloliquefaciens
subsp. plantarum and non plant associated B. amyloliquefaciens subsp. amyloliquefaciens [24]. In the
present study, one novel B. amyloliquefaciens subsp. amyloliquefaciens species was isolated from the
soil of Sundarban Mangrove Forest, Bangladesh. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the
antagonistic activity of B. amyloliquefaciens subsp. amyloliquefaciens against S. rubidaea. The
inhibition profiles of B. amyloliquefaciens subsp. amyloliquefaciens were conducted in response to
different temperature, pH and salinity (NaCl). Furthermore, antagonistic spectrum of B.
amyloliquefaciens was analyzed using various bacterial pathogens. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first report on a promising antagonistic B. amyloliquefaciens subsp. amyloliquefaciens strain from
Sundarban Mangrove Forest soil in Bangladesh against S. rubidaea. The obtained results give new
insight in the development of bio-controls agent to prevent and control S. rubidaea infections.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1 Collection of soil samples
Sundarban Mangrove Forest of Bangladesh was selected for the collection of soil samples. Soil samples
were collected in March, 2018 from different locations. Collected soil samples were kept in sterilized
plastic bags and immediately brought to the laboratory and was preserved in refrigerator before and
after analyses. The pH of the soil samples were determined by using a digital pH meter (Jenway 3310
pH meter, U.K.) making soil paste at 1 : 2 (Soil : Water) ratio.

2.2 Screening of antagonistic bacteria
Once delivered to the laboratory, samples were taken to the procedure for isolation. Pour plate
technique was used to isolate the desired organisms. Samples (1 gm) were used directly and also
diluted to 10ˉ¹, 10ˉ2, 10ˉ³, 10ˉ4 and 10ˉ5 using sterile distilled water. Different samples and dilutions
were plated into Muller Hinton Agar (MHA) medium (HiMedia) and Tryptic Soya Agar (TSA)
medium (HiMedia). The plates were incubated at 37°C for 24-48 h. Based on inhibition zone discrete
bacterial colonies were selected for isolation and were purified by repeated streaking method. Isolated
colonies were preserved in a refrigerator at 4°C. The identification of these bacterial strains was carried
out on the basis of morphological characteristics, Gram staining characteristics, BIOLOGTM
identification system and PCR identification system.
2.3 Morphological Characterization
Antagonistic isolates were purified by continuous subculture on Nutrient agar (NA) medium
(HiMedia). Colony morphologies (color, shape and size) and microscopic observations were examined
after 24 h incubation. The morphological characteristics of the isolates were checked by Gram staining
procedure [25].
2.4 Identification by BIOLOGTM System
For the species-level identification of antagonistic isolates, BIOLOGTM identification system was
applied (BIOLOGTM, USA) base on the utilization of 71 carbon sources and 23 chemical sensitivity
assays in GEN III microplate test panels. The isolates were cultured on biolog universal growth (BUG)
agar medium. All microplates and inoculating fluid were pre-warmed at 37°C for 30 mins. After 18 h
incubation the inoculum of antagonistic bacterial isolates were added to the inoculating fluid-A for
obtaining the desired turbidity which is (90-98) % T because the target cell density must be in the range
of (90-98) % T for protocol-A of GEN III Microbial ID 20 assay techniques on GEN III microplate.
The cell suspension was then poured into the multichannel pipette reservoir and the tips of multiChannel. Repeating Pipettor was filled by drawing up the cell suspension from the reservoir and all 96
wells were inoculated with accurately 100μl of bacterial suspension. The microplate was then covered
with its lid and incubates at 37°C for 18 to 24 h. After incubation, the microplate was placed into the
Micro Station Reader for analysis to obtain ID result and the result was given through comparing with
database using the software program MicroLog 4.20.05 (BIOLOG™, USA) [26]. The scope of the 96

assay reactions, coupled with sophisticated interpretation software, delivers high level of accuracy that
is comparable to molecular methods.
2.5 DNA Extraction and PCR amplification of antagonistic bacterial
Heat-thaw method was applied for the DNA extraction [27]. Isolates were grown in Nutrient broth
(NB) (Difco™) at 37°C for 24 h. 1ml broth culture was taken into eppendrof and centrifuged for 5 mins
at 10000 rpm. Following, pellet was collected then 100µl RNase free water (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
was added and uniformly mixed by vortexing. At 100°C in water bath the eppendrof tubes were boiled
for 10 mins and immediately after boiling the tubes were placed into ice for another 10 mins then the
tubes were centrifuged for 5 mins at 10000 rpm. The supernatant was collected and store at -20°C
which contains bacterial DNA.
For PCR amplification, the reactions were carried out in 30µl mixture composed of 22.5µl PCR
MasterMix (Invitrogen), 1.2 µl of each forward and reverse primer (primers F27/ R1492), DNA
template 2µl and 3.1 µl RNase free water (Thermo Fisher Scientific) 35 cycles using a thermal cycler
(BioRad) and amplification conditions were 94°C for 1 min, 60°C (for primers F27/ R1492) for 1 min,
and extension at 72°C for 1 min followed by final extension was conducted at 72°C for 5 min using a
PCR minicycler (Eppendorf Ltd., Germany). After amplification, PCR products were investigated with
1.0% agarose (Invitrogen) gel in 1X TAE buffer (50X TAE buffer, Thermo Fisher Scientific) by
electrophoresis (Compact XS/S, Biometra) and DNA bands were visualized with ethidium bromide
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) under ultraviolet (UV) transilluminator (Biometra).
2.6 Antibiotic resistance profiles of S. rubidaea
The selected strain was investigated for their antibiotic resistance proﬁles as recommended by the
Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI; Wayne, PA, USA). The strain was grown overnight
(24 h) into NB medium at 37°C. Petri dishes containing 20 ml of MHA medium allowed to solidify at
room temperature and swabbed with inoculated broth. In this study, 18 (eighteen) different types of
antibiotic discs such as Penicillin G (10 µg), Ampicillin (10 µg), Vancomycin (30 µg), Erythromycin
(15 µg), Imipenem (10 µg), Amikacin (30 µg), Doxycycline (30 µg), Gentamicin (10 µg), Nalidixic
acid (30 µg), Nitrofurantoin (300 µg), Neomycin (10 µg), Tetracycline (30 μg), Cephotaxime (30 µg),
Kanamycin (30 µg), Ceftazidime (30 µg), Ciprofloxacin (5 µg), Metronidazole (5 µg) and Tobramycin
(10 µg) were used. The agar plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Diameter (in mm) of the inhibition

zone was measured using an antibiotic zone scale. Inhibition zones diameters of antibiotics were
compared to those defined by Charteris et al., 1998 [28] and results were expressed in terms of
resistance, moderate susceptibility or susceptibility by comparing with the interpretative zone diameters
provided in the performance standards for antimicrobial disc susceptibility tests.
2.7 Antagonism assay
For the determination of growth and antagonistic activity of these isolates, three major selection criteria
were chosen such as different temperatures, a range of pH and different concentrations of salinity
(NaCl) [29]. For this purpose, active cultures (incubated for 16-18 h) were used.
2.7 .1 Thermal stability assay
NB medium was prepared and transferred to tubes in 5 ml. Then 50μl cultures inoculated to that tubes
and incubated for 24 h at 15°C, 20°C, 25°C, 30°C, 35°C, 37°C, 40°C, 45°C, 50°C and 55°C. After these
incubation periods, cells growth at different temperatures was observed and recorded. Growth was
monitored at OD 600 nm (Thermo Multiskan EX). At the same time antagonistic activity of the isolates
were also observed by the agar well diffusion method.
2.7 .2 pH stability assay
The influence of pH on the growth and antagonistic was measured with varying range of pH from 4.5,
5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.0, 7.5 and 8.0. The low pH value of the NB was adjusted to 1M HCl. The
inoculated broths were then incubated for 24 h at 37°C. Antagonistic activities of the isolates were also
observed within the same pH range.
2.7 .3 Salinity (NaCl) stability assay
The isolates were tested for the tolerance against different NaCl concentrations. The growth rate of
bacterial cultures in NB containing different levels (1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6% and 7%) of NaCl was
determined. In addition, antagonistic behaviors of the isolates were observed under the identical NaCl
concentration.
2.8 Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of
B. amyloliquefaciens
The supernatant of B. amyloliquefaciens isolats was filtered through 0.2 μm membranes and used to
determine the MIC and MBC. In brief, the supernatant were diluted in 96-well plates by two fold serial

dilutions using MHB. Then S. rubidaea of approximately 105-106 CFU/ml was added into each well,
mixed gently and then incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The last concentration that provided clear solution
when compared to the growth control was recorded as the MIC. The MBC was evaluated by pipette
each dilution from the clear wells, diluting with PBS pH 7.2 and then 10 μl of each dilution was
dropped onto NA medium for colony counts. The interpretation was that the MBC must have decreased
≥3 log10 CFU/ml or 99.9% of the bacterial cell count when compared to growth control.
2.9 Bio-control of S. rubidaea using B. amyloliquefaciens
S. rubidaea at 105-106 CFU/ml (approximately) were co-cultured with 105-106 CFU/ml (approximately)
of B. amyloliquefaciens isolate in NA medium in Erlenmeyer flasks (250 ml) and incubated for 24 h at
37°C with 200 rpm shaking. The experiment was done in triplicate. S. rubidaea cultured in the same
condition was used as a control. The viability of S. rubidaea was measured after 24, 48, 72 and 96 h
using the plate count method on NA medium, respectively.
2.10 Antimicrobial activity of B. amyloliquefaciens against others pathogenic bacteria
The selected strain was investigated for antimicrobial activity against a variety of pathogenic
microorganisms. Agar well diffusion method was modified and used to detect antimicrobial activities
[30, 31]. These assays were performed in triplicate. The plates were poured with 20 ml MHA media.
Nine different pathogens belonging to both gram-positive and gram-negative groups such as Bacillus
cereus ATCC 10876, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 11774, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 9144, Escherichia
coli ATCC 11303, Salmonella typhi ATCC 13311, Shigella flexneri ATCC 12022, Enterobacter
faecalis ATCC 29212, Vibrio parahemolyticus ATCC 17802, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853.
The pathogenic strains were grown in NB medium for 24 h and spread on the surface in MHA plate.
Three wells of each plate were made by using a sterile borer and 10 µl of the supernatant of the B.
amyloliquefaciens were placed into three well. The plates were preinoculated at room temperature for
the diffusion and incubated overnight at 37°C for 24 h. The plates were examined for zones of
inhibition. At the end of the incubation, inhibition zone diameters were measured.
2.11 Partial analysis of bacterial metabolites
Protein was precipitated according to the Acetone precipitation method [32]. Broth media with B.
amyloliquefaciens cells were centrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C and supernatant were
collected. Ice cold (-20°C) acetone was added three times (150µl) the sample volume (50µl) to the

ependrof tube. After mixing well and incubating at -20°C for overnight, centrifugation was done at
13,000-15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C temperature. Supernatant was disposed and the acetone was
allowed to evaporate from the uncapped tube at room temperature for 30 minutes. 200µl of SDS buffer
was added to the protein pellet and to determine the protein profiles extracted though Acetone
precipitation method, SDS-PAGE analysis (Bio-Rad, USA) was done with 5% stacking and 10%
separating gel at 20 mA followed by comassie blue staining dyes. After the run had been completed,
the gel was stain and destains in 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant blue and 10% Acetic acid for approximately
2 h at 100 rpm.
2.12 Statistical Analysis
All experiments were carried out in triplicate. Data were presented as the mean ± standard deviation
(SD) for the indicated number of independently performed experiments. P < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVAs).
3.0 Results and Discussion
3.1 Isolation, purification and morphological determination
Soil samples were properly diluted with sterile water and plated into MHA medium thus incubated at
37°C. After 24 h incubation bacterial growth with zone-inhibition assay was observed. According to
Lategan et al. and Haipeng Cao et al., zones of inhibition >12 mm against other organism were
considered as susceptibility to this isolate [22, 33]. In the present study, only one isolate was found to
exhibit strong antagonistic activity to the other organism, displaying 29 mm inhibition zones. (Figure
01). Thus, the isolates (both resistant and sensetive) were chosen for further study. The selected isolates
were observed by optical microscope to determine their morphology. The microscopic study of the
isolates showed the resistant strain to be Gram-positive rods, where the sensitive bacteria designated
itself as Gram-negative coccoid rod-shaped less than 1 μm in diameter. Further microscopic
observation demonstrated that the resistant strain sporulated aerobically without swelling of cell,
indicated that tested strains belong to the genus Bacillus and presumptively resistance to high
temperatures. On the other hand the sensitive strain does not produce spore.

3.2 Identification of isolates using BIOLOGTM system
The strains were correctly identified with BIOLOG™ system up to the species level. The BIOLOGTM
system aims to provide a rapid, convenient approach to bacteria identification with a database of 3000
species. The result indicates that the resistant strain identified as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens ss
amyloliquefaciens and the sensetive strain was identified as Serratia rubidaea. For further confirmation
these isolates examined for three replications. Table 01 shows the result of BIOLOGTM identification

3.3 Molecular Identification
For additional confirmation, these isolates were further identified using RT-PCR (Reverse
transcription) method. PCR amplification against the conserved regions in 16s rDNA genes of resistant
strain gave the 1400 base pair (bp) products (Fig. 2A) where 1450 bp amplicon was observed for the
sensitive strain (Fig. 2B). In the previous study, A.M. Hanafy et al., 2016 reported about B.
amyloliquefaciens that was around 1400 bp long and this data is very much consistent to our present
result [34]. Similarly, the data of RA Bonnin et al 2015 support the sensitive isolate identification as S.
rubidaea [2].

3.4 Multidrug resistance pattern of S. rubidaea
Increasing evidences suggest that the speculator bacteria S. rubidaea exhibit a resistant profile toward a
number of commercial antibiotics that leads major health problem and seriously threatens to control
this bacteria [35, 36]. To determine the resistance patterns of S. rubidaea, culture and sensitivity test
was performed. In the present experiment, eighteen (18) commercial antibiotics were used to compare
the zone of inhibition. According to this test the isolate of S. rubidaea was defined as multi drug
resistance (MDR) strain as they were resistant to three or more unique antimicrobial classes: including
aminoglycosides, quinolones, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor
combination (Fig 03 and Table 02).

3.5 Inhibition potentiality tests of B. amyloliquefaciens against S. rubidaea
Agar well diffusion method is widely used to evaluate the antimicrobial activity [37]. In this present
study, well diffusion method with 6 mm diameter was used to evaluate the potentiality of B.
amyloliquefaciens against S. rubidaea. The MHA plate is inoculated by spreading a volume of S.
rubidaea inoculums over the entire agar surface. Then, a hole is punched aseptically with a sterile cork
borer and a volume (20-100 µl) of the B. amyloliquefaciens inoculum is introduced into the well. After
that, agar plates are incubated at 37ºC for 24 h. The antimicrobial agent of B. amyloliquefaciens diffuses
in the agar medium and inhibits the growth of the S. rubidaea (Fig.4A). For further confirmation of the
potentiality of B. amyloliquefaciens, cross test was also performed (Fig.4B) that indicating B.
amyloliquefaciens may have some active substances which inhibit the growth of opportunist S.
rubidaea. As a next step, the whole above mention procedure was done for TSA medium, which gives
the identical outcome as MHA medium.
In order to further understand the activities of B. amyloliquefaciens against S. rubidaea, the mode of
action of whole bacterial cell culture and the cell free supernatant (CFS) was recorded separately. For
the preparation of CFS, bacterial culture was incubate in broth media and harvested by centrifugation at
8500 rpm for 10 minutes at 4ºC. To determine the antimicrobial spectrum, whole bacterial cell (100μl)
and CFS (100μl) were placed in 6mm diameter well on both MHA and TSA media. After 24 h of
incubation results were observed and recorded in table 03. This experiment was repeated for three
times. The result indicated that CFS of B. amyloliquefaciens can restrain the growth of S. rubidaea
where as whole bacterial cell more actively suppress the growth of S. rubidaea with in the same time
period (Fig. 4C and 4D).

3.6 Physiological parameters on growth of B. amyloliquefaciens
Morphological feature of B. amyloliquefaciens indicating that, the bacterial colony was light gray in
color, opaque with a rough matted surface and having irregular edge. The earlier studies reveled that
most of the antibiotics and/or antibiotic like substances were formed both during spore formation and
by actively multiplying cells [38]. In this present study, we found that the bacterium B.
amyloliquefaciens is very fast growing and has an optimum growth after 16 h that produce spore after
24 h of incubation. Important biochemical tests viz. carbon and nitrogen source utilization, geletin
liquefaction test, voges proskauer (VP) test and H2S tests were carried out (Table 03) for recognizing
the nature of B. amyloliquefaciens. The result of biochemical tests indicated that, the selected strain can
utilize majority of carbon and nitrogen sources. The previous studies specify that Saccharomyces yeast
exhibit negative result in both indole and H2S production [19, 24]. The present study also comply the
same phenomenon as previous studies.

Optimization of culture conditions is very important for maximum microbial growth as well as
inhibition capacity of microorganisms [39, 40]. Among the physical and chemical parameters, optimum
temperature, pH range and salt concentration are the most important as well as the time period is also
very significant [41, 42]. To acquire maximum growth of B. amyloliquefaciens, optimum growth
condition was confirmed by the measurement of optical density (OD) at 600 nm (OD600). As showed in
Fig. 05, the growth rate of isolate was expressed constitutively at different temperatures with the
highest level at 37°C. The organism can able to grow at 50°C but unable to grow below 20°C (Fig. 5A).
In the case of pH tolerance test, the growth of the isolate decrease at low pH and found to the maximum

growth rate at pH 6.5 as well as the growth declined at pH 8.0 (Fig. 5B).Tolerance to sodium chloride
was determined by testing their ability to grow in the presence of different concentrations of NaCl
(1.0%, 2.0%, 3.0%, 4.0%, 5.0%, 6.0% and 7.0%). According to the test result, the isolate was grows up
to 7.0% NaCl concentration but there was a rapid decrease in growth after 3.0% NaCl concentration
(Fig. 5C). Furthermore, to find out the optimum growth at different time periods the representative
isolate B. amyloliquefaciens was observed at various time phase. The maximum growth occurred
during the early stationary phase (24 h). During the extended stationary phase of incubation, the
activity of the organism decreased considerably to a complete termination of activity (72 h) (Fig. 5D).

3.7 Inhibition profiles of B. amyloliquefaciens against S. rubidaea in response to different
temperature, PH and salinity
The use of antagonistic bacteria is widely expected to become an alternative method for the prevention
and control of bacterial diseases. B. amyloliquefaciens are now recognized as a bacterium with an

impressive capacity to synthesize secondary metabolites with antimicrobial activity [43]. Numerous
studies have suggest that unusual surroundings such as temperature, PH, time period, dose and other
matters differentially trigger the inhibition capability of bacteria [16, 44]. Antagonistic activity of B.
amyloliquefaciens was tested at different temperatures (30ºC, 35ºC, 40ºC, 45ºC and 50ºC) with in
different time (24, 48 and 72h) periods. The temperatures were selected on the basis of optimum
growth condition of B. amyloliquefaciens. The culture showed prominent growth on selected media at
all tested temperature; however, no antagonistic activity against S. rubidaea was indicated at 50ºC with
in 72 h time period (Fig. 6A).
Among physical parameters, pH of the growth medium plays an important role in inhibition
competence of organism. Most of the earlier studies revealed that pH 6.0 to 7.0 is optimum for the
growth and inhibition ability of the majority bacterial strains [22, 45]. In this present study, we also
found that the pH 6.0 is required for the optimum growth of B. amyloliquefaciens. So, the inhibitory
effect of B. amyloliquefaciens against S. rubidaea was investigated at different pH (6.0-8.0). At pH 6.5,
more or less fifty percent (50.0%) inhibition of radial growth of S. rubidaea was shown by B.
amyloliquefaciens, which decreased nearly thirty percent (30%) at pH 8.0 (Fig. 6B). So the result
reveled that, optimal conditions for antagonistic activity were found to be 37°C and pH 6.5 at 24 h,
while the maximum growth was also observed at 37ºC and pH 6.5 within the same time period. A shift
in temperature and pH below and above this value resulted in considerable reduction in the growth and
also the antagonistic activity of B. amyloliquefaciens against S. rubidaea. However, adequate level of
growth and zone of inhibition was still observed at 30ºC to 45ºC and pH 6.0 to 7.5.
In correspondence to temperature and pH, saltinity (NaCl) enhancement also significantly affect the
antagonistic behavior of B. amyloliquefaciens. Though the growth of antagonistic isolates was
optimally observed up to 7.0% of salt concentration, but the level of inhibition of B. amyloliquefaciens
against S. rubidaea was observed up to 2.0% of salinity level at 24h. Although an increase was
observed up to 4.0% of salinity, but no activity was observed against the indicator isolate after 72 h of
incubation (Fig. 6C).

3.8 Dose dependent inhibition patterns of B. amyloliquefaciens
The inhibitory zone produced by B. amyloliquefaciens against S. rubidaea is shown in Table 05. To
evaluate the dose dependent inhibition patterns optimum temperature, pH and salinity were maintained,
as well as 24 h incubation period was also determined. The zone sizes were ranged from 8.0 mm to
29.0 mm in various concentrations of bacterial suspension. The highest zone was recorded at 30μl
concentration. The MIC value of B. amyloliquefaciens recorded as 200 μl/ml against the test bacteria.
On the contrary the MBC value noticed at 300 μl/ml against S. rubidaea (Table 06).

3.10 Antagonistic growth kinetics of B. amyloliquefaciens against bacterial pathogens
The previous studied indicating that the strains B. amyloliquefaciens possess good antagonistic activity
against a broad spectrum of microorganisms such as Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus,
Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as against certain types of fungi [46]. To obtain the
antagonistic growth kinetics of B. amyloliquefaciens against pathogenic bacteria, nine different human
pathogens belonging to both gram-positive and gram-negative were used in this study as test pathogen.
The averages diameters of inhibition zones were given in Table 07. The result revealed that B.
amyloliquefaciens exhibited various degrees of inhibitory activities against the gram-positive and gramnegative pathogenic bacteria, indicating a broad spectrum of inhibition pattern of this organism.
Maximum inhibitory activity was observed against Bacillus cereus followed by Bacillus subtilis and E.
coli. On the other hand B. amyloliquefaciens showed the least susceptibility to Salmonella entertidis.
Interestingly, previous reports indicating the antibacterial spectrum of B. amyloliquefaciens about
closely related gram-positive bacteria only, while no inhibitory activity was observed against gramnegative bacteria, especially E. coli [23, 47]. Nonetheless, in the present study we found that the B.
amyloliquefaciens showed antagonistic activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
The mode of action (bacteriostatic or bactericidal) of B. amyloliquefaciens isolate on test organisms
was also determined by inoculating from zone of inhibition on NA. Although B. amyloliquefaciens
exhibits wide range of zone of inhibition but it was bacteriostatic for most of the pathogen. The above
result indicating that the isolate might produce some substances that have inhibitory effect for a wide
range of bacteria.

3.11 Partial analysis of bacterial metabolites
The secondary metabolites (protein or enzyme or others) of B. amyloliquefaciens were determined by
SDS-PAGE (10% gel) and was compared with the standard protein marker obtained from Promega,
USA (Fig. 11). In 2003, Peng et al. reported that B. amyloliquefaciens produce a strongly fibrinolytic
enzyme called subtilis in DFE which can be used in the treatment of Thrombo-embolism is a
complication of medical diseases and surgical procedures [48]. This fibrinolytic enzyme located at “31
KDa”. In this present study, we also noticed purified enzyme on SDS-PAGE with a molecular weight
of approximately 31 KDa which is concurrence with the previous results.

4.0 Conclusion
The numbers of multidrug resistant microbial strains are continuously increasing. This situation
provided the impetus to the search for new antimicrobial substances to control multidrug resistant
organisms. Several microorganisms have provided a source of hope for novel drug compounds. Results
obtained from this study indicated that, unique characteristics of B. amyloliquefaciens exhibit strongest
antimicrobial activity than the commercially available antibiotics. For instance, Ciproflaxacin showed
the maximum zone of inhibition (20 mm) against S. rubidaea, where the B. amyloliquefaciens showed
the maximum zone of inhibition (29 mm) against S. rubidaea. Moreover, B. amyloliquefaciens can also
inhibit a broad range of other pathogenic bacteria. Further genomic analysis about B. amyloliquefaciens
would be useful for prevention and control S. rubidaea as well as will be good candidates for the
development of new antimicrobial drugs.
