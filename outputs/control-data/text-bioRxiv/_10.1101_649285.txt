Abstract Transcriptional bursts render substantial biological noise in cellular transcriptomes. Here, we investigated the
theoretical extent of monoallelic expression resulting from transcriptional bursting and how it compared to the amounts of
monoallelic expression of autosomal genes observed in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. We found that
transcriptional bursting can explain frequent observations of autosomal monoallelic gene expression in cells. Importantly,
the burst frequency largely determined the fraction of cells with monoallelic expression, whereas both burst frequency and
size contributed to allelic imbalance. Allelic observations deviate from the expected when analysed across heterogeneous
groups of cells, suggesting that allelic modelling can provide an unbiased assessment of heterogeneity within cells. Finally,
large numbers of cells are required for analyses of allelic imbalance to avoid confounding observations from transcriptional
bursting. Altogether, our results shed light on the implications of transcriptional burst kinetics on allelic expression patterns
and phenotypic variation between cells.

Introduction
Cells of identical background and type may show phenotypic differences (Symmons and Raj, 2016) and stochasticity
in the transcriptional process itself is known to generate cellular variability (Elowitz et al., 2002). In mammalian cells,
diploidy may give rise to phenotypic differences due to the unequal expression of two functionally different alleles. Indeed,
since mammalian genes are transcribed in discrete bursts (Elowitz et al., 2002; Chubb et al., 2006; Raj et al., 2006;
Suter et al., 2011) there are periodic fluctuations in the abundance of transcripts originating from each allele, which have
implications for the allelic expression within cells over time and may further extend to phenotypic differences (Reinius and
Sandberg, 2015).
The introduction of allele-sensitive single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed that RNA from substantial numbers of autosomal
genes were only detectable from a single allele in individual cells at any given time point (Deng et al., 2014). This autosomal
random monoallelic expression (aRME) is consistent with the concept of transcriptional bursting (Nicolas et al., 2017),
in particular since subsequent work demonstrated that the allelic patterns were primarily due to a stochastic process in
somatic cells rather than a mitotically heritable characteristic (Reinius et al., 2016). Furthermore, allele-specific RNA FISH
of autosomal genes in situ has shown that transcriptional bursting can explain the observed aRME in three selected cases
(Symmons et al., 2019). However, the explicit relationship between aRME and transcriptional burst kinetics has not been
systematically explored.
The two-state model of transcription (Peccoud and Ycart, 1995; Raj et al., 2006) (Figure 1A) has been extensively used
to investigate quantitative relationships between burst kinetics and other gene-level measurements (Raj et al., 2006; Suter
et al., 2011; Kim and Marioni, 2013). This model has four gene-specific parameters that may accommodate different
kinds of kinetics, mainly characterized by the burst frequency and size, with frequency normalized by mRNA degradation
rates. A main limitation to broadly investigating the implications of transcriptional burst kinetics has been the challenge of
obtaining reliable allelic estimates of transcriptional burst kinetics in diploid cells for sufficiently large numbers of genes.
However, this barrier was recently overcome by advances in the inference of transcriptional burst kinetics from allele-sensitive
scRNA-seq (Kim and Marioni, 2013; Larsson et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2017), culminating in the demonstration that

enhancers drive burst frequencies and that core promoter elements effect burst size (Larsson et al., 2019).
In the present study, we used parameters of burst kinetics inferred from thousands of genes of a mouse cross breed
(CAST/EiJ × C57BL/6J) (Larsson et al., 2019). We showed that most genes have a pattern of expression that is consistent
with the concept of dynamic aRME (Reinius and Sandberg, 2015), wherein monoallelic expression occurs due to independent
bursts of transcription from each allele. The inferred kinetic parameters predict the fraction of monoallelic expression on
each allele with high precision. We furthermore showed, in vitro and in vivo, that the fraction of monoallelic expression is
mainly driven by the frequency of transcriptional bursts rather than burst sizes, whereas allelic imbalance is a consequence
of both burst frequencies and size.

Results
We first investigated the theoretical impact of transcriptional burst kinetics on random monoallelic gene expression, using the
two-state model of transcription (Figure 1A). Importantly, a vast number of combinations of burst frequencies and sizes
results in the same level of mean expression, which is readily observable in scRNA-seq data (Figure 1B). To investigate
where in parameter space monoallelic gene expression patterns occur, we first calculated the probabilities of generating
monoallelic expression for two alleles with identical transcriptional kinetics throughout kinetics parameter space. The
parameters (𝑘𝑜𝑛 , 𝑘𝑜𝑓 𝑓 , 𝑘𝑠𝑦𝑛 ) describe the distribution of transcripts at steady state (Methods) and give the probability of detecting
a transcript from the allele of a given gene, 𝑃 (𝑛 > 0|𝑘𝑜𝑛 , 𝑘𝑜𝑓 𝑓 , 𝑘𝑠𝑦𝑛 ), where 𝑛 is the number of transcripts. By conditioning the
probabilities on the total probability of expression 𝑃 (monoallelic|expressed) , we find that genes with low burst frequency (𝑘𝑜𝑛 )
and size (𝑘𝑠𝑦𝑛 ∕𝑘𝑜𝑓 𝑓 ) are always monoallelically expressed given that there is expression at all (Figure 1C). A combination of
high burst frequency and size gives exclusively rise to biallelic states, while intermediate combinations of these extremes lie
on a spectrum in-between. If we do not condition on expression, we can observed a ridge of states of monoallelic expression
where biallelic and no expression dominate on either side of the ridge (Figure 1D).
As transcriptional burst kinetics are inferred on each allele independently (Larsson et al., 2019), we asked to what extent
the measurements of monoallelic and biallelic expression from scRNA-seq experiments concur with the model predictions. To
this end, we used inferred transcriptional burst kinetics of genes on the CAST and C57 alleles from 224 individual primary
mouse fibroblasts (Larsson et al. (2019), CAST/EiJ × C57BL/6J) which resulted in 4,905 autosomal genes with reliable
kinetics inferred for both alleles after filtering (Methods). In these cells, we calculated the fraction of monoallelic expression
from both alleles and considered whether the monoallelic expression was affected by the burst kinetics of the genes. We found
that the observed fraction of monoallelic expression show the same relationship with the burst kinetics as predicted by theory,
with a ridge of monoallelic expression appearing across the parameter space of burst kinetics (Figure 2A). Furthermore,
we estimated the probabilities of observing a cell which is either silent, biallelic, monoallelic on CAST or monoallelic on
C57 for all genes, assuming that transcription occurs independently on each allele. The predicted fractions of cells in each
state were highly correlated with the observed fraction of cells in each category (Spearman 𝑟 = 0.98, 0.99, 0.92 and 0.93
respectively), (Figure 2B) demonstrating that modelling transcription using the two-state model at each allele independently
is in agreement with experimental allelic expression analyses by scRNA-seq.
The theoretical results indicated that changes in aRME can be achieved by modulation of either burst frequency or size. To
investigate which parameter of transcriptional bursting is the most decisive factor for aRME in the cell, we examined the profile
of burst frequency and size in relation to monoallelic expression to isolate their relative contributions. The burst frequency of
the CAST and C57 alleles compared to their fraction of monoallelic expression showed a striking relationship (Figure 2C).
At lower burst frequencies, we observed very low amounts of monoallelic expression because there was predominantly no
expression from either allele in any cell. The fraction of monoallelic expression increased as the burst frequency increased,
up until the point where biallelic expression became the predominant observation and monoallelic expression then declined.
This relationship was also clear in the theoretically predicted case which demonstrated that our model predictions were
consistent with the biological data (Supplementary Figure 1). The same analysis on burst size showed that the distribution of
monoallelic expression was almost uniform over burst size with a tendency of genes with large burst sizes to have more biallelic
expression (Figure 2D). Therefore, while burst size has the theoretical capability to influence the amount of monoallelic
expression in cells, it plays a minor role relative to burst frequency. The predominant role of burst frequencies in determining
monoallelic gene expression can also be seen in the slope of the ridge of monoallelic expression (Figure 1D,Figure 2A)
To extend the inference and analyses of transcriptional burst kinetics to cell types in vivo, we sequenced individual cells
from dorsal skin of the same mouse cross breed (C57BL/6JxCAST/EiJ). In the 354 single-cell transcriptomes (post quality
control), we identified 10 clusters (Figure 3A) that could be assigned to cell types of variable heterogeneity using existing

skin single-cell transcriptomics data (Joost et al., 2016). The relationship between burst kinetics and random monoallelic
gene expression for cells in vivo was consistent with the data from primary fibroblasts (Supplementary Figure 2).
Due to the heterogeneous cellular composition of certain clusters, we could quantify how well each cell-type cluster
predicted its own biallelic expression based on the model of independent allelic transcriptional bursting (Methods). We
anticipated that high heterogeneity within a cell cluster would show an underestimation of predicted biallelic expression due
to subsets of heterogeneous cells with higher burst frequency for certain genes. Indeed, the median observed-to-expected
ratio of biallelic expression (O/E ratio) based on all cells (irrespective of clustering) indicated a clear transcriptome-wide
underestimation of biallelic expression (median = 2.1, 𝑛 = 10,543 genes).
To examine the potential of allelic-expression modelling as an unbiased method to assess the degree of heterogeneity
within groups of cells, we first examined housekeeping genes as they would have less cell-type-specific transcriptional burst
regulation compared to other genes and thereby have observed biallelic call frequencies closer to the expected value (an O/E
ratio closer to 1). Indeed, housekeeping genes had a significantly lower O/E ratio compared to randomly selected subsets
of genes, and were close to the ratio observed in the fibroblast cells (𝑝 < 10−5 , permutation test, Figure 3B). Importantly,
the stratification of cells into clusters greatly improved the O/E ratio compared to randomly selected sets of cells, with
the exception of three clusters (containing mixed unassigned cells, partly endothelial and dermal papillae cells, 𝑝 < 10−3 ,

permutation test, Figure 3C). Therefore, the observed-to-expected biallelic expression due to transcriptional bursting may be
a valuable metric to quantify the heterogeneity within an assigned cell cluster.
Investigating gene expression at the discrete level of monoallelic and biallelic expression is natural at the single-cell level
as it is frequently observed due to transcriptional bursting. However it is also important to assess the consequences of
transcriptional bursts on the continuum of allelic bias or imbalance. To this end, we calculated the theoretical probabilities
of the allele of a gene occurring in larger or equal amounts than the other allele, 𝑃 (𝐶57 > 𝐶𝐴𝑆𝑇 ), 𝑃 (𝐶𝐴𝑆𝑇 > 𝐶57) and
𝑃 (𝐶𝐴𝑆𝑇 = 𝐶57), in the primary fibroblasts. The probability of equal expression is dominated by the outcome of no expression
on either allele, which is predictably related to the burst frequencies of the two alleles of the gene (Supplementary Figure 3).
Most genes have very similar kinetics between the two alleles and therefore a close to equal probability of unequal expression
for each allele, as measured by 𝑃 (𝐶57 > 𝐶𝐴𝑆𝑇 |𝐶57 ≠ 𝐶𝐴𝑆𝑇 ) (Supplementary Figure 3).
The probabilities were in good agreement with the observed fractions of allelic bias (Figure 4A). By comparing the fold
changes in burst size and frequency between alleles to their observed fraction of allelic bias, we found that the relative
differences in transcriptional burst kinetics in burst frequency as well as size tended to affect allelic bias for that gene
(Figure 4B). Interestingly, simultaneous relative changes in both burst frequency and size may cancel each other out. For
example, a reduction in burst size may be compensated by an increase in burst frequency (Figure 4B; visualized along the
diagonal of the scatter plot). By using linear regression with allelic bias as the dependent variable, we determined that relative

changes in both burst frequency and size together explain the allelic bias to a high degree (𝑅2 = 83.7%) and both relative
changes have significant impact on allelic bias (Table 1). Thus, the imbalanced gene expression of CAST and C57 alleles
arise from genetic variation in regulatory enhancers and promoter sequences (Larsson et al., 2019), affecting both burst
frequencies and sizes.

To determine the extent to which transcriptional bursting may give rise to false positives in studies of allelic imbalance
in single cells, we simulated the expression from two alleles with kinetics identical to those inferred from the C57 allele for
different number of cells (Figure 5A, 𝑛 = 10, 20, 50, 100, 1,000 and 10,000 cells). We then estimated the allelic imbalance
for all genes based on a model that expected equal expression from both alleles. At a low number of sequenced cells, the
variance in expression due to transcriptional bursting severely impacts the allelic imbalance measurements and give rise to a
high number of false positives, but becomes increasingly stable with a higher number of cells (Figure 5B). In relation to

mean expression, we find that it is only for low-expressed genes that false positive allelic imbalance becomes frequent, and
this declines as the number of simulated cells increases (Figure 5C).

Discussion
In this study, we explored if transcriptional burst kinetics can explain observed patterns of random monoallelic gene expression
of autosomal genes (Reinius and Sandberg, 2015). We report a striking resemblance between theory and observations in
allelic expression patterns, which provides explicit support that transcriptional burst kinetics result in frequent monoallelic
expression of autosomal genes. Moreover, we conclude that burst frequency largely determines the extent to which a gene is
monoallelically expressed in somatic diploid cells, whereas both burst frequency and size contribute to allelic imbalance.
We additionally explored to what extent transcriptional bursts can lead to spurious observations of allelic imbalance in cell
populations. In full agreement with single-molecule RNA FISH analyses of allelic gene expression in cells in vivo, we also found
that lowly expressed genes can be falsely identified as having allelic imbalance simply due to their stochastic transcription
(Symmons et al., 2019). The number of false positives of allelic imbalance that we present is likely a conservative estimate,
as we do not include genes for which the burst kinetic inference procedure fails and therefore exclude many genes which have
even lower expression level than the genes analyzed herein. Here, we also did not extensively model the technical noise present
in the library preparation or the variability during sequencing. However, simply increasing the numbers of cells investigated
for example in an RNA-sequencing experiment might not fully mitigate this effect, since cellular proportions of the cell type
constituents combined with their cell-type specific expression might still result in a number of genes which are subject to
noisy allelic imbalance estimates due to transcriptional bursting. To what extent this can explain the scarce numbers of
autosomal genes with clonally propagated monoallelic gene expression is currently unknown, but it is interesting in this
context to note that most previously identified genes were detected at very low levels (around two RNA transcripts per cell on
average when expressed, (Reinius and Sandberg, 2015; Eckersley-Maslin et al., 2014; Gendrel et al., 2014). It is clear
that future studies of monoallelic gene expression and allelic imbalance in diploid cells need to consider the consequences of
stochastic transcription.
There is current great excitement in using single-cell RNA-sequencing to identify and characterize cell types, sub-types
and cellular states throughout human tissues and in model organisms (Regev et al., 2017; Han et al., 2018). In these
efforts, methods that can determine the quality of cell type assignments are important and allelic modelling of transcriptional
kinetics could be a strategy for unbiased evaluation of the homogeneity within assigned cell clusters. Here, we suggest biallelic
status as a measure of cellular heterogeneity within a cluster of cells. We show that housekeeping genes and our in vivo

cell clusters from mouse skin show an observed-to-expected biallelic expression ratio which is lower than what would be
expected by chance. If there is heterogeneity with regards to the kinetic bursting parameters between the cells we would
expect to observe biallelic expression at a much higher frequency than what would be predicted and therefore a higher biallelic
O/E ratio. In model organisms, this can easily be achieved by profiling cells of F1 offspring of characterized parent strains.
However, phased haplotypes may also be obtained for human cells in the transcribed parts of the genome from the single-cell
RNA-sequencing data itself (Edsgärd et al., 2016), which would allow for such modelling.
Transcriptional bursting results in considerable cellular heterogeneity in cases of two functionally different alleles (e.g. see
Montag et al. (2018)). It is however not clear if such variation has phenotypic consequences. Interestingly, transcriptional
bursting was recently shown to impact T-cell linage commitment (Ng et al., 2018) which raise the intriguing question whether
cell fate decisions in general could be affected by stochastic transcription. Since burst frequency is preferentially encoded in
enhancer regions (Larsson et al., 2019) it is likely that mutations in cis-regulatory sequences or trans-activating factors
may affect the penetrance of phenotypes. This may be particularly relevant in the case of lineage commitment, which exhibits
switch-like irreversible activation. In the case of allelic imbalance, burst size may play a relatively larger role in terms of
phenotype. The relative abundances of protein products resulting from translation of the two different alleles may be affected
by burst size which could be relevant in the case of phenotypes that result due to the stoichiometric constraints present in
signalling pathways and gene networks.

The model used for stochastic gene expression is a particular case of a birth-and-death process in a Markovian environment.
In short, the model has the states (𝑖, 𝑛) where 𝑖 ∈ {0, 1} indicates if the gene is active or not, and 𝑛 is the number of RNA
transcripts in the cell.
In the off state, the gene can turn on with the rate 𝑘𝑜𝑛 . In the on state, the gene can turn off with rate 𝑘𝑜𝑓 𝑓 and produce one
RNA transcript with the rate 𝑘𝑠𝑦𝑛 . Regardless of the state, one RNA transcript can be degraded with rate 𝛾. At the steady state
of this process, the stationary distribution can be shown to be described by the Poisson-beta distribution, in which we let

The resulting marginal distribution 𝑃 (𝑛|𝑘𝑜𝑛 , 𝑘𝑜𝑓 𝑓 , 𝑘𝑠𝑦𝑛 ) is the probability distribution for the amount of RNA transcripts observed
at steady state given the rates 𝑘𝑜𝑛 ,𝑘𝑜𝑓 𝑓 and 𝑘𝑠𝑦𝑛 .

Inference of transcriptional burst kinetics.
We inferred kinetic bursting parameters for 7,191 and 7,186 genes for the C57 and CAST allele respectively from 224 F1
cross-breed (CASTxC57) adult tail fibroblasts. We then applied a goodness-of-fit test to these parameters to assess how
well the parameters describe the data and found that 5,586 and 5,601 genes fit the model for the C57 and CAST alleles
respectively. The intersection of kinetic parameters between both alleles after accounting for the goodness-of-fit test and
removing genes on the X chromosome result in 4,905 usable genes for our analysis. The method to infer these parameters
given allele-sensitive scRNA-seq data and the goodness-of-fit test is described in Larsson et al. (2019) and the code for
doing so is available at https://github.com/sandberg-lab/txburst.

Calculating the probabilities and observed fractions for silent, biallelic, monoallelic expression and allelic
bias.
Given the parameters inferred in Larsson et. al. we can calculate the probability of allele expressing a given gene or not
at the time of sampling. We define a function of the probability of observing 𝑘 UMI counts for an allele of gene 𝑔 given the
parameters, 𝑃 (𝐾 = 𝑘|𝑘𝑜𝑛 , 𝑘𝑜𝑓 𝑓 , 𝑘𝑠𝑦𝑛 ).
With the resulting genes we can calculate the probabilities of an allele of the genes not being observed, i.e.
𝑝𝑔𝐶57 = 𝑃𝑔𝐶57 (𝐾 = 0|𝑘𝑜𝑛 , 𝑘𝑜𝑓 𝑓 , 𝑘𝑠𝑦𝑛 )

199

and
𝑝𝑔𝐶𝐴𝑆𝑇 = 𝑃𝑔𝐶𝐴𝑆𝑇 (𝐾 = 0|𝑘𝑜𝑛 , 𝑘𝑜𝑓 𝑓 , 𝑘𝑠𝑦𝑛 ).

expression on no allele 𝑝𝑠𝑖𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑡 = 𝑝𝑔𝐶57 𝑝𝑔𝐶𝐴𝑆𝑇
monoallelic expression on the C57 allele 𝑝𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑜𝐶57 = (1 − 𝑝𝑔𝐶57 )𝑝𝑔𝐶𝐴𝑆𝑇
monoallelic expression on the CAST allele 𝑝𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑜𝐶𝐴𝑆𝑇 = (1 − 𝑝𝑔𝐶𝐴𝑆𝑇 )𝑝𝑔𝐶57
biallelic expression 𝑝𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑐 = (1 − 𝑝𝑔𝐶𝐴𝑆𝑇 )(1 − 𝑝𝑔𝐶57 )

These probabilities assume that the alleles burst independently. Since our probabilities closely follow the observed
fractions this assumption seems to be correct. The contour plots in Figure 1C and Figure 1D are based on 100x100
parameter combinations where 𝑘𝑜𝑓 𝑓 is varied to change burst size while is held constant at 100.
For each gene, we calculated the fraction of no expression, monoallelic on C57, monoallelic on CAST and biallelic expression
by averaging the following conditional statements over the cells where 𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑙𝑒 refers to the number of actual UMI counts for that
allele in that cell:
•
•
•
•

No expression: 𝑛𝐶57 = 0 and 𝑛𝐶𝐴𝑆𝑇 = 0
Monoallelic expression on the C57 allele: 𝑛𝐶57 > 0 and 𝑛𝐶𝐴𝑆𝑇 = 0
Monoallelic expression on the CAST allele: 𝑛𝐶𝐴𝑆𝑇 > 0 and 𝑛𝐶57 = 0
Biallelic expression: 𝑛𝐶𝐴𝑆𝑇 > 0 and 𝑛𝐶57 > 0

For the comparisons between predicted and observed values we used spearman correlations.

where 𝑎1 and 𝑎2 is the number of RNA transcripts from allele 1 and 2 respectively and 𝑛 is the highest number of RNA
transcripts for 𝑎1 with a non-zero probability of being observed. For each gene we then find three probabilities 𝑃 (𝐶57 > 𝐶𝐴𝑆𝑇 ),
𝑃 (𝐶𝐴𝑆𝑇 > 𝐶57) and 𝑃 (𝐶𝐴𝑆𝑇 = 𝐶57)

Preparation, sequencing and analysis of skin cells.
Skin tissue was dissected from 9 week old female F1 offspring of matings between CAST/EiJ and C57BL/6J mice (approval
by the Swedish Board of Agriculture, Jordbruksverket: N95/15). Cells were dissociated from skin as described in Joost et
al. 2016, or using GentleMACS ( Miltenyi Biotec); with both methods giving similar cell yields and viability. Briefly, for the
GentleMACS method, dorsal skin was cut and minced into small pieces (approximately 1x1mm) and incubated in HBSS
(Sigma) + 0.04% BSA (Sigma) + 0.2% Collagenase Ia (Sigma) at 37°C for 60 minutes with occasional agitation. Thereafter this
slurry was processed on a GentleMACS (Miltenyi Biotec) with 2x Program D, cell-strained (70um) and washed. Residual
tissue was further treated with HBSS + 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA (Sigma) at 37°C for 15 minutes and processed likewise. For the
Joost et al method, GentleMACS dissociation was substituted with manual disaggregation by smashing tissue fragments
against a cell strainer with the piston from a 5 mL syringe. Cells were sorted into 384-well plate by FACS, and subject to
Smart-seq2 single-cell RNA-sequencing library creation (Picelli et al., 2014). The single-cell libraries were sequenced on
an Illumina HiSeq4000, the sequence fragments aligned to the mouse genome (mm10) and summarized into expression
levels (RPKMs) and allele-resolved expression, as previously described (Larsson et al., 2019). Single-cell data was processed
and analysed using Seurat (version 2.3.4), including log-normalization, regression of the total number of detected reads,
identification of genes with most biological variation (n=1000), SNN-based clustering (distances in PCA-space, using the 20
top principal components), followed by manual curation of certain clusters (endothelial cells, dermal papillae, dendritic cells,
mixed cluster). Cells with less than 100k mapped reads were excluded from the analysis (30 cells). The allelic expression
levels were used for transcriptional burst kinetics inference, as described above. The discrepancy in scale between burst
size values in the smart-seq2 data and the Larsson et al. (2019) data is due to UMIs, for a more detailed discussion see
Larsson et al. (2019).

Assessing heterogeneity of cell-type clusters by observed-to-expected biallelic expression
We sequenced 384 cells from the dorsal skin (in telogen) of the C57BL/6JxCAST/EiJ cross breed using smart-seq2 (Picelli
et al., 2014), see above for details. To calculate the observed-to-expected ratio of biallelic expression for each gene, we
calculated the expected fraction of cells with biallelic expression based on the model of independent bursts of transcription,
𝐸𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑐 (𝑔) =

⎧
⎪1
𝐼(𝑛) = ⎨

246
247

if 𝑛 > 0
if 𝑛 = 0.

We then calculate the observed number of cells with biallelic expression for that gene, 𝑂𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑐 (𝑔), to combine them to obtain
𝑂𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑐 (𝑔)∕𝐸𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑐 (𝑔). The list of housekeeping genes was obtained from (Li et al., 2017).
