Abstract

24

The spatial architecture of the islets of Langerhans is hypothesized to facilitate synchronized

25

insulin secretion between β cells, yet testing this in vivo in the intact pancreas is challenging.

26

Robo βKO mice, in which the genes Robo1 and Robo2 are deleted selectively in β cells, provide

27

a unique model of altered islet architecture without loss of β cell differentiation or islet damage

28

from diabetes. Combining Robo βKO mice with intravital microscopy, we show here that Robo

29

βKO islets lose synchronized intra-islet Ca2+ oscillations between β cells in vivo. We provide

30

evidence that this loss is not due to a β cell-intrinsic function of Robo, loss of Connexin36 gap

31

junctions, or changes in islet vascularization, suggesting that the islet architecture itself is

32

required for synchronized Ca2+ oscillations. These results will have implications for

33

understanding structure-function relationships in the islets during progression to diabetes as

34

well as engineering islets from stem cells.

Introduction

36

The islets of Langerhans, which comprise the endocrine pancreas, are highly organized

37

micro-organs responsible for maintaining blood glucose homeostasis. Islets are composed of

38

five endocrine cell types (α, β, δ, PP, and ε) which, in rodents, are arranged such that the β cells

39

reside in the core of the islet, while other non-β endocrine cells populate the islet mantle1.

40

Human islet architecture is more complex; however, it still follows non-random patterning in

41

which multiple core-mantle-like units comprise a single islet2. In both rodent and human islets,

42

respective stereotypical islet architectures prioritize homotypic over heterotypic interactions

43

between endocrine cell types3. The biological reason for preferential homotypic interactions

44

between endocrine cells is not completely clear, but it has been suggested to be important for

45

dictating the level of Connexin36 (Cx36)-mediated electrical β cell-β cell coupling, thus

46

controlling synchronization of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) between neighboring

47

β cells4,5.

48

Synchronous insulin secretion between β cells is triggered when glucose from the blood

49

enters the β cells through glucose transporters. As this glucose is metabolized, the ratio of

50

intracellular ATP/ADP in the cells increases. The rise in ATP causes ATP sensitive K+ channels to

51

close, resulting in membrane depolarization. The resultant depolarization causes voltage-gated

52

Ca2+ channels to open, triggering an influx of Ca2+ into the cell, which in turn promotes

53

exocytosis of insulin granules6-8. This chain of events is cyclical and thus results in oscillations of

54

membrane potential, cytosolic Ca2+ levels, and insulin secretion in response to glucose9.

55

Because β cells within an islet are gap-junctionally coupled, and thus electrically coupled, these

56

oscillations are synchronous across all islet β cells10. It is thus hypothesized that preferential β
3

57

cell homotypic contact allows for the necessary amount of gap junctions to form between

58

neighboring β cells in order to synchronize the oscillations in an entire islet, facilitating pulsatile

59

insulin secretion5,11. Indeed, modeling experiments in which the number of homotypic β cell-β

60

cell nearest neighbor connections is lowered within an islet result in predicted perturbation of

61

synchronous Ca2+ oscillations5. If this in silico prediction is correct, then disrupting spatial

62

organization of the different endocrine cell types within the islet alone, without affecting any

63

other property of the cells, should be sufficient to disturb synchronized insulin secretion

64

between β cells. However, direct empirical evidence for this hypothesis is lacking.

65

Most genetic mouse models that show disruption of islet architecture also display

66

defects in glucose homeostasis12. However, in many of these models, the disrupted islet

67

architecture phenotype is linked to either developmental defects in β cell differentiation or

68

maturation13-24 or to pathologies related to β cell damage in diabetes25-30. This introduces a

69

strong confounding factor for studying the role of islet architecture on β cell function.

70

Therefore current mouse models of disrupted islet architecture unsuitable for directly testing

71

the hypothesis that the preferential homotypic β cell-β cell interactions, dictated by canonical

72

islet architecture, regulate synchronized insulin secretion between β cells within the same islet.

73

Recently, we have described a mouse model in which the cell-surface receptors Robo1

74

and Robo2 are deleted specifically in β cells (Robo βKO), resulting in disruption of canonical

75

endocrine cell type sorting within the islets31. Unlike other models of disrupted islet

76

architecture, the β cells in the islets of Robo βKO express normal levels of markers for β cell

77

differentiation and functional maturity, and do not display markers of β cell damage or stress.

78

We reasoned that this model would allow us to directly test the role of islet architecture on

79

synchronous islet oscillations between β cells in a fully differentiated, non-diabetic islet setting.

81

Results

82

Robo βKO islets express mature β cell markers despite having disrupted islet architecture and

83

endocrine cell type intermixing

84

We have previously shown that genetic deletion of Robo1 and Robo2 selectively in β

85

cells using either Ins1-Cre; Robo1Δ/Δ2flx/flx or Ucn3-Cre; Robo1Δ/Δ2flx/flx mice (Robo βKO) results in

86

disrupted islet architecture and endocrine cell type sorting without affecting β cell death,

87

proliferation, or the expression of the β cell maturation markers MafA and Ucn331. To verify

88

that β cells in Robo βKO islet are truly mature, we expanded the analysis to look at transcript

89

levels of all maturity markers. We performed RNA sequencing and differential gene expression

90

analysis on FACS-purified β cells from both Robo βKO and control islets, and observed no

91

change in transcript levels of any hallmark β cell maturity or differentiation genes (n=2 mice of

92

each genotype; Supplemental Figure 1). Thus, unlike other mouse models with disrupted islet

93

architecture, β cells in Robo βKO islets maintain maturity and differentiation despite loss of

94

normal islet architecture.

95
96

Robo βKO islets have fewer homotypic β cell-β cell contacts than control islets

97

In silico simulations where the degree of β cell-β cell coupling is changed through a

98

decrease in homotypic nearest neighbors predict that disruption in islet architecture will disrupt

99

synchronous intra-islet Ca2+ oscillations and hormone secretion pulses3,5,32. To test whether β

100

cells in Robo βKO islets have fewer homotypic β cell neighbors on average than control islets,

101

we performed nearest neighbor analysis on islets from pancreatic sections from Robo βKO and

102

control mice (Figure 1). We found that Robo βKO islets possess significantly fewer β cell-β cell

103

contacts (n=9-11 islets for 3 mice from each genotype; control 75.35%, Robo βKO 50.37%,

104

p=0.01), and homotypic contacts in general when compared to control islets (n=9-11 islets for 3

105

mice from each genotype; control 83.7%, Robo βKO 64.43%, p=0.0008). We also found that

106

Robo βKO islets possess significantly more β cell-α cell contacts (n=9-11 islets for 3 mice from

107

each genotype; control 11.21%, Robo βKO 25.99%, p=0.02), and heterotypic contacts in general

108

when compared to control islets (n=9-11 islets for 3 mice from each genotype; control 16.3%,

109

Robo βKO 35.57%, p=0.0008). Together, this suggests that Robo βKO islets make fewer

110

homotypic β cell-β cell connections compared to control islets. We reasoned that the altered

111

degree of homotypic β cell-β cell interaction in Robo βKO islets together with the seemingly

112

retained β cell maturity provide a unique model by which to test the hypothesis that endocrine

113

cell type organization affects synchronous insulin secretion in the islet.

114
115

Robo βKO islets display unsynchronized Ca2+ oscillations in vivo

116

To investigate how the reduced homotypic β cell-β cell connections in Robo βKO islets

117

affects insulin-secretion dynamics, we adopted a novel intravital Ca2+ imaging method which

118

enables imaging of islet Ca2+ dynamics in situ within the intact pancreas33. In brief, this method

119

employs an intravital microscopy (IVM) platform and adeno-associated viral (AAV) delivery of

120

insulin promoter-driven GCaMP6s, a fluorescent Ca2+ biosensor, to quantitate β cell Ca2+

121

dynamics in vivo in both Robo βKO and control islets. This method thus allows for retention of

122

the islet’s in vivo microenvironment, blood flow, and innervation, and provides more realistic

123

conditions than in vitro approaches allow for.

124

We verified that synchronous Ca2+ oscillations are maintained in vivo in islets by

125

measuring GCaMP6s intensity of β cells within AAV8-RIP-GCaMP6 infected islets of control

126

(Robo WT) mice (Figure 2). As expected, control mice displayed whole islet synchronous Ca 2+

127

oscillations for at least 10 minutes after glucose elevation (n=3 islets from 1 mouse; Figure 2

128

and Supplemental Video 1). We quantified the degree to which these oscillations are

129

synchronous within the islet by analyzing the amount of correlation between GCaMP6s active

130

areas within individual islets. While oscillations vary in frequency between islets, the degree of

131

correlation between β cells within any one islet is very high, confirming that control islets

132

possess highly synchronous intra-islet Ca2+ oscillation in vivo (fraction of GCAMP6s activity with

133

correlated Ca2+ oscillations=0.97±0.005, n=3 islets from 1 mouse; see Figure 4A).

134

Conversely, we found that most Robo βKO islets display asynchronous intra-islet Ca2+

135

oscillations in vivo (Figure 3, Supplemental Figure 2, Supplemental Videos 2 and 3).

136

Quantification of this asynchronous behavior through correlation analysis of GCaMP6s activity

137

within individual Robo βKO islets revealed significant reduction in intra-islet correlated

138

oscillation areas compared to controls (fraction of GCAMP6s activity with correlated Ca2+

139

oscillations=0.62±0.1, n=8 islets from 4 mice, p<0.01; Figure 4A). Further, asynchronous Robo

140

βKO islets showed spatially distinct areas within the islet that oscillated synchronously with

141

immediate β cell neighbors but not with more distant regions within the same islet (Figure 3C-

142

D, and Supplemental Figure 2). This was not due to differences in the proportion of GCaMP6s

143

positive cells showing elevated Ca2+ activity within Robo βKO islets compared to controls

(control islets 0.98±0.008 fraction active, n=3 islets from 1 mouse; Robo βKO islets 0.96±0.02

145

fraction active, n=5 islets from 3 mice, p=0.35; Figure 4B).

146

Interestingly, 3 out of the 8 Robo βKO islets imaged showed synchronous Ca2+ activity in

147

greater than 90% of GCaMP6s positive areas (Figure 4A, Supplemental Figure 3 and

148

Supplemental video 4). Moreover, upon performing organ clearing and imaging on Robo βKO

149

pancreata, we observed multiple islets with relatively few α cells penetrating the β cell core

150

(Figure 5, Supplemental Videos 5 and 6). It is likely that those Robo βKO islets with normal

151

architecture are the same islets which retain synchronous Ca2+ oscillations. Together, these

152

observations suggest that some mechanisms governing synchronous Ca2+ oscillations within an

153

islet are not controlled intrinsically by Robo expression within β cells. This fits with the

154

hypothesis that architecture of the islet itself facilitates synchronous oscillations.

155

Further, analysis of the speed of wave propagation and time lag in the highly correlated

156

Robo βKO islets showed a trend towards a reduction in wave propagation speed (Figure 4C) and

157

an increase in time lag (Figure 4D) when compared to controls, though these failed to reach the

158

threshold for statistical significance (control islets wave propagation: 119.5±49.13µm/sec, n=3

159

islets from 1 mouse; Robo βKO islets wave propagation: 38.67±16.6µm/sec, n=3, p=0.1940;

160

control islets phase lag: 0.057sec ±0.005, n=3 islets from 1 mouse: Robo βKO islets phase lag:

161

0.083±0.01sec, n=3, p=0.0934; Figure 4C-F). Islets with sub-optimal coupling have been shown

162

to display full synchronization in Ca2+ oscillations, but with lower wave velocity10. Because there

163

is a trend toward slower wave velocity, these Robo βKO islets may still have sub-optimal

164

coupling due to architecture changes despite their fully synchronized Ca2+ oscillations.

166

Robo βKO islets retain the ability to form gap junctions and have similar levels of

167

vascularization

168

Besides a decrease in β cell-β cell homotypic contacts within the islet, a possible

169

explanation for the loss of synchronized whole islet Ca2+ oscillations in Robo βKO islets is that β

170

cells in Robo βKO islets no longer possess the gap junctions necessary for adequate electrical

171

coupling. Indeed, the phenotype described above is reminiscent of that observed in mice

172

heterozygous for a Cx36 null allele10,34. To test whether Robo βKO mice form fewer gap

173

junctions between β cells, we measured the area of Cx36 protein immunofluorescence

174

normalized to islet area in Robo βKO and control islets (Figure 6). We observed no difference in

175

Cx36 immunofluorescence between Robo βKO islets and controls (Figure 6B), suggesting that

176

loss of synchronous intra-islet Ca2+ oscillations is not due to failure of gap junction formation in

177

β cells (control islets: 0.01±0.002 Cx36 signal/µm2, Robo βKO islets: 0.01±0.001 Cx36

178

signal/µm2, n=10-15, p=0.17 islets from 4 mice of each group).

179

Another possible explanation for the observed uncoupling of intra-islet Ca2+ oscillations

180

in Robo βKO islets is that β cell-β cell contact in Robo βKO is disrupted due to physical blocking

181

by non-endocrine tissue. To determine if other non-endocrine architectural changes within the

182

islet occur in Robo βKO mice we quantified the amount of matrix components secreted by

183

vessels as a surrogate for vasculature (laminin, and collagen IV) in Robo βKO and control islets.

184

In all cases we found no significant difference in area of vessel matrix components (Figure 7)

185

between Robo βKO and control islets, suggesting that interfering blood vessels are likely not the

186

cause of loss of whole islet synchronous Ca2+ oscillations (normalized laminin β1 area: control

191

Discussion

192

In this study, we provide evidence for the importance of islet architecture for proper

193

islet function in vivo. When islet architecture is disrupted while β cell maturity is retained in

194

Robo βKO mice, synchronized Ca2+ oscillations are perturbed in the in vivo islet. This is not due

195

to loss of Cx36, or change in amount of islet vascularization. Robo βKO β cells possess fewer

196

homotypic nearest neighbors than controls, suggesting a limited capacity to electrically couple

197

β cells across the islet. Taken together, these data indicate that islet architecture itself,

198

uncoupled from β cell maturity or availability of gap junction machinery is important for

199

coordinated insulin secretion between β cells.

200

Robo, and its ligand Slit, have been previously shown to affect Ca 2+ oscillations in β cell

201

in vitro35. However, while it is possible that intrinsic β cell factors rather than the disrupted islet

202

architecture alone contribute to disruption of synchronized Ca2+ oscillations in Robo βKO islets

203

in our experiments, this is not likely the driving force. If this was the case, then we would expect

204

a highly penetrant asynchronous oscillation phenotype in Robo βKO islets, yet more than one-

205

third of Robo βKO islets analyzed showed highly synchronized Ca2+ oscillations. Instead, these

206

results suggest that deletion of Robo alone in β cells is not sufficient to abolish synchronicity.

207

Moreover, Robo βKO islets show a heterogeneous spectrum of disrupted architecture within

208

the same animal, with some islets displaying severe endocrine cell type intermixing while

209

others retain relatively normal architecture. Thus it is likely that islets with relatively normal

210

architecture correspond to the islets that display more synchronous Ca2+ oscillations. Moreover

211

phenotypic heterogeneity is likely not due to an incomplete deletion of Robo in a subset of

212

islets. This is evident by the fact the islets were detected during the Ca2+ imaging experiment by

213

the fluorescent labeling of β cells with the H2B-mCherry lineage-tracing reporter31, which uses

214

the same Cre that is used to delete Robo in those β cells. Thus expression of H2B-mCherry

215

precludes inefficient Cre expression and recombination.

216

It also remains possible that other components of islet architecture besides endocrine

217

cell type sorting contribute to disruption in Ca2+ oscillations found in Robo βKO islets.

218

Specifically, while we have shown that the amount of vascularization between Robo βKO islets

219

and controls is similar, we cannot draw conclusions on whether the pattern of vessels is

220

unchanged. Further, it is possible that amount and patterning of innervation may vary between

221

Robo βKO and controls. This is particularly of interest because Robo has known roles in

222

angiogenesis and axon guidance, and thus could affect precisely how the islet is innervated and

223

vascularized36.

224

Finally, our results may have implications towards directing islet architecture in the

225

pursuit of generating bona fide islets from stem cells in vitro for the treatment of diabetics.

226

Thus far, most efforts to create such stem cell derived islets have focused on creating

227

homogenous functionally mature β cells37. Such efforts have been largely successful in terms of

228

creating β cells that display insulin secretory profiles close to those of primary β cells38. Yet

229

despite their seeming resemblance to mature native β cells, islets made from stem cell-derived

230

β cells fail to fully match the function of isolated primary islets37,38. This has been partially

231

attributed to the fact that stem cell derived islets formed in vitro thus far have been simply

232

clusters of homogenous β cells, rather than an organized heterogeneous population of β cells

233

and other islet cell types37. Because of the importance of heterogeneous cell types in

234

controlling glucose homeostasis, it has become evident that achieving correct β cell

235

heterogeneity is needed to generate better islets in vitro39. However, it is likely that addition of

236

these cells without recapitulation of islet architecture will not generate islets with optimum

237

function and β cell coupling.

Animals

260

The experimental protocol for animal usage was reviewed and approved by the University of

261

Wisconsin-Madison Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) under Protocol

262

#M005221 and Protocol #M005333, and all animal experiments were conducted in accordance

263

with the University of Wisconsin-Madison IACUC guidelines under the approved

264

protocol. Robo1Δ,2flx40, Ins1-Cre41, Urocortin3-Cre42 and Rosa26-Lox-Stop-Lox-H2BmCherry43

265

mice were previously described. All mouse strains were maintained on a mixed genetic

266

background. Control colony mates in all analyses were Robo+/+ with the either Ins1-Cre or Ucn3-

267

Cre.

Immunofluorescence

270

Pancreata were fixed with 4% PFA at 4°C for 3h, embedded in 30% sucrose and frozen in OCT

271

(Tissue-Tek). Pancreatic sections (10 µm) were stained using a standard protocol. The following

272

primary antibodies and dilutions were used: guinea pig anti-Insulin (1:6, Dako, IR00261-2),

273

mouse anti-Glucagon (1:500, Sigma G2654), rabbit anti-Glucagon (1:200, Cell Signaling 2760S),

282

RNA sequencing

283

RNA was isolated from FACS sorted lineage-traced β cells31 from control and Robo βKO mice

284

using phenol chloroform extraction (TRIzol). DNA libraries were generated using Takara’s

285

SMART-Seq v4 Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing (Takara, Mountain View, California, USA) for

286

cDNA synthesis and the Illumina NexteraXT DNA Library Preparation (Illumina, San Diego, CA,

287

USA) kit for cDNA dual indexing. Full length cDNA fragments were generated from 1-10ng total

288

RNA by SMART (Switching Mechanism at 5’ End of RNA Template) technology. cDNA fragments

289

were fragmented and dual indexed in a single step using the Nextera kit’s simultaneous

290

transposon and tagmentation step. Quality and quantity of completed libraries were assessed

291

using Agilent DNA series chip assay (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and Invitrogen Qubit

292

ds DNA HS Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA), respectively. Each library was standardized

293

to 2nM. Cluster generation was performed on Illumina cBot, with libraries multiplexed for

294

1x100bp sequencing using TruSeq 100bp SBS kit (v4) on an Illumina HiSeq2500. Images were

295

analyzed using standard Illumina Pipeline, version 1.8.2.

297

Intravital Imaging

298

Mouse pancreata were exposed in anesthetized mice by making a small incision on the right

299

side of the mouse, and externalizing the tip of the pancreas. A glass dish was placed over the

300

exposed pancreas and the mouse was placed on a microscope stage with isoflurane anesthesia

301

for the remainder of imaging. Islets were identified on the surface of the pancreas by detecting

302

Histone H2BmCherry fluorescent nuclei labeled by β cell-specific lineage-tracing reporter31.

303

Once islets were identified, mice were given injections of 1g/kg body weight glucose (30% in

304

saline) intraperitoneally. Blood glucose levels were monitored through tail vein bleeds. Once

305

the blood glucose reached ~300 mg/dL, GCaMP6s activity was identified using the microscope

306

eye piece. When imaging a time course of GCaMP6s intensity, a z-stack was set to 8 or 12 slices

307

each 8µm apart. Images were captured every 10 or 30 seconds respectively over 10 minutes at

308

a resolution of 512x512 pixels. After time courses were recorded, high resolution image z-stacks

309

were taken with 60 z planes taken 1µm apart or 8 z-planes taken 8µm apart at 1024x1024 pixel

310

resolution. For some images, rhodamine-dextran was injected retro-orbitally to mark the

311

vasculature of the islets in vivo.

312
313

Gap junction and vasculature quantification

314

Cx36 levels were quantified from images of islets co-stained with rabbit anti-Cx36 (Invitrogen)

315

and Guinea Pig anti-insulin antibody. Vasculature levels were quantified from images co-stained

316

with rat anti-Laminin β1 or rabbit anti-col IV and guinea pig anti-insulin. 8 Z-planes were taken

317

1µm apart on a Leica SP8 Scanning Confocal microscope using a 40x oil immersion objective

318

(Cx36) or 20X (vasculature). Threshold masks were made of both channels for each islets, and

319

the area of each staining was measured using FIJI’s analyze particles functions. The area of gap

320

junctions, blood vessels (marked by their respective antibody) was divided by the area of insulin

321

for each islet. 10-14 islets were analyzed for n=2-8 mice for each genotype. Student’s T-test was

322

performed to obtain P values.

Nearest Neighbor Analysis

325

β cells were identified using the lineage tracer Rosa26-Lox-Stop-Lox-H2BmCherry crossed to

326

Ucn3-Cre and tissue sections were stained with antibodies against glucagon and somatostatin

327

to identify α and δ cells respectively. The 3D Tissue Spatial Analysis Toolbox for Fiji44 was used

328

to identify specific cell types using the above markers and to calculate the number of cell type

329

specific nearest neighbors from all identified endocrine cells. Analysis was performed on 9-11

330

islets from n=3 mice from each genotype.

332

Whole Organ Clearing and Imaging

333

Pancreata were fixed in 4% PFA for 3 hours at room temperature, then dehydrated stepwise in

334

methanol (33, 66%, and 100%) for 15 mins each step. Samples were then bleached using

335

MeOH:H2O2:DMSO bleaching buffer in a 2:1:3 ratio at RT for 24 hr, and then stored in methanol

336

overnight. Next, Samples were freeze-thawed for at least 5 cycles of 24 hour freeze then 2 hour

337

thaw in -80°C-RT to facilitate antibody penetration. Samples were then rehydrated stepwise

338

back to TBST (33%, 66%, 100%), at least 15 min/step, reducing the MeOH during each step.

339

Samples were then blocked in TBST with 10% donkey serum, 5% DMSO and 0.01% NaAz for 12-

340

24 hr at RT. Samples were then incubated with primary antibodies (Dako guinea pig anti-Insulin

341

and CST Rabbit anti-glucagon) in blocking buffer for 48 hr- 72 hr, then washed overnight in

342

TBST. Following wash, samples were incubated with secondary antibodies (594 anti-glucagon

343

and 647 anti-insulin) for 48-72 hr at RT, then washed overnight in TBST. Whole pancreata were

344

then mounted in low melting temp agarose for imaging. Whole pancreata were imaged using a

custom light sheet microscope. 2D images were collected in a 3 mm x 5 mm field of view every

346

10 um over a 5 mm volume to generate the 3D reconstruction. Imaris was used to assign

347

surface volumes to pancreas morphology, insulin surfaces, and glucagon surfaces by intensity

348

thresholding.

Time Course Image Analysis

351

All images were analyzed using previously published methods45 with custom Matlab

352

(Mathworks) scripts. For activity analysis, images were smoothed using a 5x5 pixel averaging

353

filter. Areas without significant fluorescence were removed. Saturated areas were also removed

354

by limiting the area to intensity below the maximum value. Photobleaching was adjusted for by

355

removing any linear trend. Any islets with significant motion artifacts were removed or time

356

courses were shortened to the time over which no significant movement occurred

357

(displacement of <0.5 cell width). For the time course of each pixel in the image with significant

358

fluorescence, a peak detection algorithm was used to determine if the areas had peak

359

amplitudes significantly above background. A region was considered “active” if the

360

corresponding time course for each pixel had a peak amplitude >2.4x background. The fraction

361

of active area was calculated as the number of pixels detected as “active” across all z-planes,

362

normalized to the total number of pixels that showed significant fluorescence across all z-

363

planes that were not saturated. Islets with significant background fluorescence from spectral

364

overlap of channels were excluded from activity analysis because “inactive” cells were

365

indistinguishable from background and therefore total islet area could not be accurately

366

calculated. Coordination was determined based on coincident timing of identified peaks, where

367

areas were segmented by identified peaks occurring at similar time points. The cross

368

correlation of the time courses for two 5x5 pixel subregion was taken. If the correlation

369

coefficient was >0.75, then the two subregions were considered highly coordinated and merged

370

into a larger region. The coordinated area was calculated as the number of pixels in the largest

371

area of coordination across all z-planes normalized to the total number of pixels of the islet that

372

were determined to be ‘active’ for all planes. This analysis is based on previous analysis 45, but

373

adjusted for 3-dimensional data. Phase lag and wave propagation speed was determined as

374

in10, where 2 regions were chosen manually within a coordinated area within the same z-plane.

375

The phase lag of these regions was calculated from a Fourier transform of each time course.

376

First the peak frequency was identified from the power spectrum, as generated from a Fourier

377

transform of each time course. At each peak frequency the phase was then calculated. The

378

phase lag was calculated from the difference in phase between each region, and converted into

379

a time lag according to (𝑑𝑡=(1𝑓)∗𝑡𝑎𝑛−1(𝜑1−𝜑2)), where 𝜑1−𝜑2 is the phase difference, and 𝑓 is

380

the sampling frequency of the time courses analyzed. Speed was calculated by dividing the

381

distance between the two regions by the time lag. For phase and speed analysis only islets with

382

>90% coordinated area was used. All statistical analysis was performed in Prism (Graphpad) or

383

Matlab. First a F-test was used to determine if variances were equal then a Student’s t-test or

384

Welch t-test (for unequal variance) were utilized for determining whether activity,

385

coordination, phase lag and speed were significantly different. p<0.05 was considered

386

significant.
