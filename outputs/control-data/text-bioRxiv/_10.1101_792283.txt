Abstract

11
12

The loss of crop yield due to weeds is an urgent agricultural problem. Although

13

herbicides are an effective way to control weeds, more sustainable solutions for weed

14

management are desirable. It has been proposed that crop plants can communally

15

suppress weeds by shading them out. Shade avoidance responses, such as upward leaf

16

movement (hyponasty) and stem or petiole elongation, enhance light capture of

17

individual plants, increasing their individual fitness. The shading capacity of the entire

18

crop community might, however, be more effective if aspects of shade avoidance are

19

suppressed. Testing this hypothesis in crops is hampered by the lack of well-

20

characterized mutants. We therefore investigated if Arabidopsis competitive

21

performance at the community level against invading competitors is affected by the

22

ability to display shade avoidance. We tested two mutants: pif4pif5 that has mildly

23

reduced petiole elongation and hyponasty and pif7 with normal elongation but absent

24

hyponasty in response to shade. Although pif4pif5 performed similar to wildtype, we

25

found that pif7 showed significantly increased canopy biomass and suppression of

26

invading competitors as compared to its wildtype. Our data thus show that modifying

27

specific shade avoidance aspects has potential for plant community performance. This

28

may help to suppress weeds in crop stands.

Introduction

44

Competition from weeds accounts for substantial yield losses in global crop

45

production systems (Bridges, 1994; Liebman et al., 2001; Oerke 2006). Weed control

46

is usually accomplished by the extensive use of herbicides, and although these can be

47

effective, they are costly and have negative side effects on people’s health and the

48

environment (Buhler, 2002; Chauhan and Johnson, 2010). There is, therefore, an

49

urgent need for novel methods to suppress weeds in a cost-effective and sustainable

50

manner.

51

Light is the core energy source for all plants, and when grown at high planting

52

densities, individual plants consolidate light capture by growing away from the shade

53

cast by neighboring plants, a process called shade avoidance (de Wit et al., 2016a).

54

Proximate plants are detected through the red (R) : far-red (FR) light ratio (R:FR) in the

55

light reflected between plants, a ratio that decreases because of selective absorption

56

of R light for photosynthesis and reflection of FR light. When weeds emerge in a crop

57

vegetation, FR reflection becomes more intense due to the presence of more plant

58

biomass, leading to strong reduction of R:FR (Pierik and Testerink, 2014). Several

59

studies have shown that under low R:FR conditions, crops develop phenotypes such

60

as inhibition of lateral branching (tillering) in wheat (Ugarte et al., 2010), formation of

61

smaller tubers and longer stem in potato (Boccalandro et al., 2003) and increased stem

62

elongation in maize (Dubois et al., 2010). All these morphological changes have a

63

negative impact on crop productivity (Robson et al., 1996; Boccalandro et al., 2003).

64

One approach to improve crop yield and suppress weeds, is by optimizing the shading

65

capacity of the entire crop community, for example by optimizing planting patterns

66

and plant phenotypic responses to density. In Evolutionary Agroecology (a.k.a.

67

Darwinian Agriculture) it is proposed that shade avoidance responses that enhance

68

individual plant performance, actually reduce performance of the entire community

69

of crop plants (Weiner et al., 2010).

70

Studies on cereal crops have shown that optimization of cropping pattern and density

71

based on the community, rather than the individual performance, led to a more

72

effective weed suppression and increased crop productivity (Weiner et al., 2001;

73

Olsen et al., 2005, 2006; Kristensen et al., 2008). This has for example been shown to

74

increase wheat yield by up to 30% (Weiner et al., 2001). This major improvement may

75

be explained by the fact that crop plants growing in uniform patterns can collectively

76

create a stronger shade over the weeds than those sown in for example row planting

77

patterns. In other words, crop plants can collectively suppress weeds much better

78

than individual plants would be capable of. Since shade avoidance responses have a

79

major impact on the 3D architecture of the plant, they strongly impact the shading

80

capacity of a uniform plant community. Here, we will investigate to what extent

81

modulation of shade avoidance responses at high planting density can improve

82

shading capacity, competitor (weed) suppression and canopy plant performance.

83

Shade avoidance responses are typically elicited upon detection of a reduced R:FR

84

ratio, and are further promoted by depletion of blue light when the canopy closes (

85

(Ballaré, 1999; de Wit et al., 2016b). Shade avoidance responses include upward leaf

86

movement (hyponasty), elongation of stems and petioles and inhibition of branching

87

(Franklin, 2008; Pierik and de Wit, 2013; de Wit et al., 2016b). These responses help

88

plants reposition their leaves away from the shade and into the light. Shade avoidance

89

responses have been observed in most crop species and also in a variety of wild

90

species, including the genetic model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Ballaré, 1999;

91

Franklin, 2008; Martínez-García et al., 2010; Casal, 2012; Gommers et al., 2013).

92

In responses to low R:FR, phytochrome photoreceptors are inactivated (Ballaré, 1999;

93

Franklin et al., 2003; Kozuka et al., 2010) and this relieves their repression of

94

Phytochrome Interacting Factors (PIFs) (Li et al., 2012; Jeong and Choi, 2013; Leivar

95

and Monte, 2014), a class of transcription factors that promote the expression of

96

growth promoting genes (Oh et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2013). PIF4, PIF5 and PIF7 are

97

the dominant PIF proteins involved in shade avoidance in Arabidopsis (Lorrain et al.,

98

2008; Koini et al., 2009; Hornitschek et al., 2012; Li et al., 2012; Pantazopoulou et al.,

99

2017).

100

Shade avoidance responses in crops are often associated with reduced yield, because

101

resource investments are rerouted from harvestable organs towards stem elongation

102

(Robson et al., 1996; Boccalandro et al., 2003; Carriedo et al., 2016). These responses

103

furthermore create a more open canopy architecture, which allows more light

104

penetration that in turn facilitates weed growth.

105

Here, we will investigate if canopy planting patterns and modifications of shade

106

avoidance responses can indeed optimize canopy architecture to suppress

107

competitors by improved shading capacity. We will compare Arabidopsis thaliana

108

wildtype with well-described mutants for aspects of the shade avoidance syndrome;

109

an opportunity that does not (yet) exist in other plant species. We show that the pif7

110

mutant that lacks a hyponastic response, but has preserved petiole elongation

111

responses to neighbors, performs significantly better at high density, uniform planting

112

patterns, than does its corresponding wildtype. Modest inhibition of both elongation

113

and hyponasty in the pif4pif5 double mutant on the other hand did not affect plant

114

performance. Consistent with our hypothesis, a canopy of pif7 plants was better able

115

to suppress competing invaders than was a shade avoiding wildtype canopy.

116

Our data indicate that modifying plant canopy architecture through altered shade

117

avoidance characteristics provides great opportunity to control weed proliferation in

118

cropping systems in a sustainable way.

additional nutrients [6 g of slow release fertilizer (Osmocote ‘plus mini’ Ammonium

129

Nitrate Based Fertilizer; UN2071; Scotts Europe BV, Heerlen, The Netherlands) and 6

130

g MgOCaO (17%; Vitasol BV, Stolwijk, The Netherlands]. The pif4pif5pif7 plants were

131

sown in a different pot three days after canopy plants for germination. Sowing was

132

followed by stratification for four days (dark, 4°C). After stratification plants were

133

moved to a short-day growth chamber (9 h/15 h of light/dark period respectively; R:FR

134

was 2.3 and PAR = 150 µmol m-2 s-1). When canopy plots were 15 days old (seeds of

135

the canopy were sown directly in plots), competitor pif4pif5pif7 seedlings (12 days

136

old) were transplanted into the plot (Fig. S1). The canopy plots were grown for another

137

29 days and subsequently harvested. Measurements were performed on four plants

138

for each plot. Petiole and lamina length of the three longest leaves from each plant

139

were measured with a digital caliper. Individual plant leaf area was scanned and

140

determined with image-J software. Shoot dry weight was recorded with a digital scale,

141

after drying the tissue at 70°C oven for three days. Plot biomass and LAI were

142

calculated from the four individuals by extrapolating to the full plot and density. The

143

heights of the canopies were measured with a ruler while the canopy cover was

144

determined from top photographs using the Plant CV software (Gehan et al., 2017). In

145

the canopy cover measurements by the PlantCV, we exclude the outer plants of the

146

canopy to avoid edge effects. The height and the canopy cover measurements were

147

taken every five days, starting from the day 20 of canopy growth. Seed output was

148

recorded in separate experiments with the same growth conditions, three months

149

after sowing. Every 10 days (starting from the sowing day) plants were watered with

150

nutrients, on all other days they were watered with tap water. When the first silique

151

from each pot turned brown, watering was stopped. The number of siliques was

152

measured, after two weeks of ripening. Petiole angles (hyponasty) (Fig.3 and Fig.4)

153

and lamina length (Fig. S5) of the fifth-youngest leaf were measured digitally with

154

image J. Pictures were taken every day for 13 days, starting at day 28 (t=0).

R:FR measurements

157

The R:FR measurements started at day 20 (before the competition starts, (de Wit et

158

al., 2012)] by using the Spectrosense2-Skye light sensor with a glass fiber extension

159

with 0.6 cm light collection area. The sensor was placed inside of the canopy plot (Fig.

S1A) and measured the R:FR from four different directions and on four different

161

positions, resulting in 16 measurements per time/per pot. When canopy closure

162

occurred, the sensor was placed under the canopy, without causing any damage to

163

the plants or interfering with the canopy shade. The measurements were always taken

164

from the same position in all densities and patterns.

171

[uniform (equal distance between the plants) and row (bigger distance between the

172

rows of the plants but smaller distance between the plants within the rows), See Fig.

173

S1B)]. In uniform pattern, the distance between the plants was 3 cm, 2 cm and 1 cm

174

in low, medium and high density respectively. In row pattern, the distance between

175

the rows was always 5 cm while within the rows the distance between the plants were

176

0.6 cm, 1.25 cm and 2 cm in high medium and low density respectively. For the

177

canopies consisting of pif4pif5 and pif7 plants only high density-uniform pattern was

178

used. The number of competitor pif4pif5pif7 plants and their positions which were

179

transplanted into the high density-uniform pattern plots were the same in all the

canopies [16 plants per pot (1111 plants m-2)] (Fig. S1C).

192

A functional-structural plant (FSP) model (Vos et al., 2009) of Arabidopsis rosettes,

193

previously used and described in (Bongers et al., 2017, 2019; Pantazopoulou et al.,

194

2017), was used to simulate Arabidopsis plant types, using the simulation platform

195

GroIMP and its radiation model (https://sourceforge.net/projects/groimp/).

196

Arabidopsis rosettes were represented by a collection of leaves (represented by a

197

petiole and lamina) whose appearance rate and shape were based on empirical data

198

(Bongers et al., 2017). The leaves individually grew in time in 3D based on light

199

interception, photosynthesis and plant-wide carbon allocation principles (for detailed

200

explanations of the principles see Evers, 2016; Bongers et al., 2017). In addition, leaves

201

showed petiole elongation and hyponastic responses based on the virtual touching of

202

leaves and the perception of R:FR (Bongers et al., 2017). Therefore, individual growth

203

and shade avoidance responses depended on the capture of light (represented by PAR

204

intensity) and the perception of R:FR within the simulated canopy.

205

The light source emitted PAR representing 220 μmol m-2 s-1 and a R:FR ratio of

206

2.3, which corresponded to the growth chamber experiments. 100 plants were placed

207

in a uniform grid of 10 × 10 with an inter-plant distance of 1 cm, of which only the

208

middle 16 plants were used for analyses. Plants grew for 44 days based on the PAR

209

captured, photosynthesis rates and carbon allocation patterns (Evers, 2016; Bongers

210

et al., 2017). Each model time step, which represented 24 hours, hyponastic responses

211

could occur if leaves touched or if R:FR perception at the lamina tip was below 0.5

212

(Bongers et al., 2017; Pantazopoulou et al., 2017). The strength of the hyponastic

213

responses depended per model scenario; plants could increase their leaf angle with 0,

214

0.2, 1, 5, 10, 15 or 20 degrees per day. The angle of the leaves over time was therefore

215

a function of the number of times in which touch and/or low R:FR perception occurred

216

per individual leaf, with a maximum leaf angle of 80 degrees. The intensity of PAR that

217

reached the soil was captured by 64 virtual soil-tiles (each 0.25 cm2) underneath the

218

16 middle plants.

Results

225

The effect of planting density and pattern on Col-0 performance

226

To investigate the effect of sowing pattern and density on Arabidopsis thaliana

227

(hereafter Col-0) performance, we grew canopy plots in three different densities (low,

228

medium and high) and two different patterns (uniform and row) (Fig. 1A). The R:FR

229

showed a reduction in all densities and patterns through time, reflecting the growing

230

canopy (Fig. 1B). However, the strongest and most rapid decline of R:FR was observed

231

in high density/uniform pattern, where the R:FR was decreased from approximately

232

2.0 to 1.1 after eight days of measurements hinting at a rapidly closing canopy (Fig.

233

1A). This was not the case for the row pattern in high density, where the R:FR was still

234

high, presumably because the inter row distance was higher than in the uniform

235

pattern. Low and medium density showed reduction of R:FR (less than 1.5) at day 36

236

(Fig. 1B), indicating that the canopy remained more open for a longer period of time.

237

The leaf area index (LAI) expresses the amount of leaf area per unit soil area and

238

reflects the closure status of the canopy. LAI increased more strongly in the uniform

239

than in the row pattern and mostly in the medium and high densities (Fig. 1C).

240

Interestingly, leaf lamina length decreased with increasing plant density, irrespective

241

of the planting pattern (Fig. S3A). The opposite was observed for petiole length, where

242

the high density induced the strongest elongation (Fig. S3B). Enhanced petiole

243

elongation, combined with reduced lamina size, are classic aspects of shade

244

avoidance.

245

Furthermore, there was a strong and significant effect of the density and planting

246

pattern on Col-0 biomass. The row pattern produced Col-0 plants with the smallest

247

dry weight, indicating that the intraspecific competition was higher in rows compared

248

to the uniform pattern. In terms of planting density, the total biomass of the plot in

249

high density and uniform pattern was higher than the other densities (medium, low)

250

than the row pattern (Fig. 1D).

251

The number of siliques per square meter for the different density and planting

252

patterns was consistent with biomass (Fig. 1E), which suggests that the uniform-

253

planting pattern at the high density would result in the highest yield per unit area.

256

Using a previously published 3D computational Arabidopsis model (Bongers et al.,

257

2017), we determined the percentage of light penetration in the canopy through time

258

and under control of different degrees of hyponasty. Seven different hyponastic

259

scenarios were simulated; from 0 degrees up to 20 degrees hyponastic growth (Fig. 2).

260

The simulations show that canopies, consisting of plants with minimal hyponastic

support the notion that upward leaf movement responses to neighbors may facilitate

266

light penetration through the canopy, which can be beneficial for weed growth.

to neighbors (e.g. 0,0.2, 1 and 5 degrees) create strong reduction of light

On the other hand, scenarios with faster hyponasty allowed for less light

267

To test experimentally if altered hyponastic growth can regulate canopy

268

closure and light penetration, we selected previously published mutants with altered

269

shade avoidance characteristics. The pif7, pif4pif5 double and pif4pif5pif7 triple

270

knockouts have reduced hyponastic responses to shade cues in short-term

271

experiments (Pantazopoulou et al., 2017) and we verified their responses to

272

prolonged shade cue conditions. Reduction in R:FR resulted in the elevation of Col-0

273

petiole angle (hyponasty) during the first two days (day 29 and 30), while petiole

274

elongation was promoted from day 28 until 34 (Fig. 3A-D). pif7 had a similar petiole

275

elongation response as did Col-0 in all the treatments but its hyponastic response to

276

low R:FR was entirely absent, whereas its response to green shade (reproducing

277

canopy shade) was severely reduced (Fig. 3A & 3B). pif4pif5 showed a phenotype

278

initially similar to wild-type both in terms of petiole angle and elongation, but the

279

petiole elongated slightly less through time in low R:FR. On the other hand,

280

pif4pif5pif7 was unresponsive to low R:FR for both traits (Figure 3C & 3D). Green filter

281

triggered a continuous shade avoidance phenotype in Col-0 (hyponasty and petiole

282

elongation) from day 28 up to 36 (8 days) (Figure 3B & 3D). Hyponastic responses were

283

reduced in pif4pif5 and not observed at all in pif7 and pif4pif5pif7 under these severe

284

shade conditions (Fig. 3A & 3C). In general, Col-0 shade avoidance responses

285

(hyponasty & petiole elongation) were stronger in green shade than in low R:FR alone.

286

Overall, pif4pif5 was less responsive than Col-0, whereas pif4pif5pif7 was fully

287

insensitive to the different light conditions. Interestingly, pif7 showed similar petiole

288

growth as Col-0 and a similarly absent hyponastic response as in pif4pif5pif7.

289

The impact of different magnitudes of hyponastic responses in canopy closure,

290

was tested by growing canopies of Col-0, pif7 and pif4pif5. We decided not to use the

291

pif4pif5pif7 triple mutant as a canopy plant, but as an invading competitor in

292

establishing canopies. High density, uniform planting patterns were used, since these

293

closed their canopies most effectively (Fig. 1). Here, we monitored the canopy closure

294

state through time by using the imaging analysis PlantCV (Fig. 4). Data showed that

295

pif7 canopies developed a better soil cover than Col-0 and pif4pif5 early in the canopy

296

development (day 20 until 25). The pif4pif5 canopies remained more open than pif7

297

canopies for another five days but percentage of the covered soil area was not

298

significantly different from Col-0 canopies at day 30. At later stages all canopies had

299

developed nearly full closure without. The pif4pif5 canopies display reduced petiole

300

elongation compared to pif7 and Col-0 (Fig. 3D), resulting in a relatively low canopy

301

height for this double mutant (Fig. S4B). The height of pif7 canopies was also reduced

302

as compared to Col-0 (Fig. S4B), presumably because of the reduced upward leaf

303

movement in this mutant (Fig. 3A)

Performance of canopy and competitor plants during competition

306

To test the impact of separate shade avoidance traits on competitor suppression and

307

canopy performance, we used as canopy plants the strong shade avoider Col-0, the

308

mild reduction of shade avoidance genotype pif4pif5, and pif7 which does not show

309

hyponasty but does induce petiole elongation upon low R:FR (Fig. 3). As an invading

310

competitor we used pif4pif5pif7, which was planted between the canopy plants. To

311

estimate shade avoidance responses of the different genotypes in true canopies,

312

rather than independent light treatments, we measured petiole and lamina length at

313

the end of the canopy development. pif7 canopy plants displayed the largest lamina

314

compared to Col-0 and pif4pif5 canopy plants during competition. Petiole length was

315

enhanced upon competition in Col-0 and pif7 but not in pif4pif5 canopy plants (Fig.

316

S6). The strong lamina and petiole elongation but not hyponasty (fig. 3 and fig S4B)

317

responses of pif7 during competition could have resulted in the higher biomass and

318

LAI compared to the other two genotypes (Fig. 5). This also had a strong effect on

319

pif4pif5pif7 competitor performance. The faster closed canopy and plant growth of

320

pif7 during competition was associated with a reduction in growth of pif4pif5pif7

321

competitors (Fig. 6A & 6B). On the other hand, the improved light exposure of

322

pif4pif5pif7 competitor plants under the rapidly closed canopy of pif4pif5 was

323

associated with enhanced biomass and leaf area (L.A.) of the competitor triple mutant

324

compared to the other genotypes (Fig. 5, 6A & 6B). Indeed, the pif4pif5pif7 competitor

325

hardly survives under the pif7 canopy while the percentage of survival between Col-0

326

and pif4pif5 was similar (Fig. 6C).

Discussion

330

The adaptability of to changing environments and their competitive potential makes

331

them a major threat for agricultural yields when they interact with crop plants (Oerke,

332

2006). Studies in the past decades found that crop sowing uniformity in high density

333

can positively affect yield and suppress weeds (Weiner et al., 2001; Olsen et al., 2006;

334

Kristensen et al., 2008). A second way to improve crop yield and suppress weeds,

335

according to the principles of Evolutionary Agroecology would be by controlling the

336

shade avoidance properties of the crops in a way that would minimize light

337

penetration through the canopy down to the soil where weeds sprout (Weiner et al.,

338

2010). Since only very few well-defined shade avoidance mutants exist in crops

339

(Carriedo et al., 2016; Kebrom and Mullet, 2016; Weiner et al., 2017), we tested the

340

impact of shade avoidance modulation on canopy performance and weed suppression

341

in the model species Arabidopsis thaliana.

342

Although petiole elongation, combined with upward leaf movement (hyponasty), will

343

increase access to light at the individual plant level (Ballaré and Pierik, 2017;

344

Pantazopoulou et al., 2017), the reduced leaf lamina growth that typically occurs in

345

shade avoiding Arabidopsis (de Wit et al., 2015) may counterbalance the predicted

346

gain in photosynthesis of individual plants (Fritz et al., 2018). Part of the shade

347

avoidance responses will have been triggered through the drop in R:FR inside the

348

canopies (Fig. 1B). However, shade avoidance responses, and especially hyponasty,

349

can on their turn also affect the R:FR inside the canopy by affecting the extent to which

350

a vertical canopy structure is formed in this otherwise horizontally growing rosette

351

species (de Wit et al., 2012). Modulating shade avoidance traits in different canopy

352

structures may thus affect light distribution inside these canopies. Indeed, using a 3D

353

Arabidopsis plant model (Bongers et al., 2017), we found that slow-down of

354

hyponastic growth upon shade detection in all canopy plants can clearly reduce light

355

penetration through the canopy down to soil level (Fig. 2). To test the consequences

356

of this scenario experimentally and also monitor the effect that these canopies can

357

have on competitor performance we used Arabidopsis mutants that had similar

358

hyponastic responses variations as used in the 3D plant model. As a competitor, we

359

used the pif4 pif5 pif7 triple mutant, which remained unresponsive in terms of

360

hyponasty and petiole elongation under the long-term shade conditions. The

361

pif4pif5pif7 would not be able to outgrow the canopy plants, allowing us to 1) mimic

362

the crop-weed competition where crops (like cereals) typically have a size advantage

363

and 2) record the effect of different canopy architectures (i.e. pif7 and pif4pif5) on

364

competitor performance. The canopy architecture of pif7 had a strong negative impact

365

on the performance of competitor pif4pif5pif7 and a positive impact on its own canopy

366

biomass (fig. 5A). Under these conditions, the pif4pif5pif7 competitor biomass and

367

survival rate were significantly lower than under Col-0 and pif4pif5 canopy

368

architectures (Fig. 6A & 6C). We propose that the much faster closing of the pif7

369

canopy together with the larger LAI as compared to the Col-0 and pif4pif5 canopies

370

(Fig. 4, S4 & fig. 5B), resulted in less light availability for the competitor, leading to

371

reduced performance of the competitor.

372

Interestingly, despite the fact that the pif4pif5 canopy architecture showed mild

373

reduction of shade avoidance responses, the competitor pif4pif5pif7 performed

374

similar in Col-0 and pif4pif5 canopy. We speculate that the advantage of modestly

375

reduced shade avoidance in pif4pif5 for communal competitor suppression might be

376

outweighed by its reduced overall growth rate, which still leads to a relatively open

377

canopy.

378

As mentioned above, pif4pif5pif7 lacks any shade avoidance response to plant density,

379

signaled by low R:FR and green filter (fig. 3). This allowed us to study if the resident

380

canopy architecture can be optimized such that growth in the understory can be

381

inhibited by shading the invading competitors. Future studies could be designed to

382

include competitors that can show shade avoidance responses and thus have the

383

capacity to compete stronger against the dominant canopy. It would be possible then

384

that the invading competitors could even escape from the shade-casting canopy

385

altogether and enhance their individual fitness at the expense of the collective fitness

386

of the dominant canopy. If good mutants come available for upright-growing, stem-

387

forming plants, these could be used to test scenario’s of a more vertically layered

388

canopy, representing many of the staple crops world-wide, for weed-suppression.

389

Our data show that losing one of the shade avoidance responses in Arabidopsis

390

canopy, hyponasty, has potential to suppress competitors. Translating this to crop-

391

weed competition scenario’s depends on the architecture of the crop plant but could

392

potentially improve weed suppression and reduce yield losses due to weeds.
