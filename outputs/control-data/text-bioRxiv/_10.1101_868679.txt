Summary

Cancers arise through the acquisition of oncogenic mutations and grow through clonal
expansion1,2. Here we reveal that most mutagenic DNA lesions are not resolved as mutations
within a single cell-cycle. Instead, DNA lesions segregate unrepaired into daughter cells for
multiple cell generations, resulting in the chromosome-scale phasing of subsequent
mutations. We characterise this process in mutagen-induced mouse liver tumours and show
that DNA replication across persisting lesions can generate multiple alternative alleles in
successive cell divisions, thereby increasing both multi-allelic and combinatorial genetic
diversity. The phasing of lesions enables the accurate measurement of strand biased repair
processes, the quantification of oncogenic selection, and the fine mapping of sister chromatid
exchange events. Finally, we demonstrate that lesion segregation is a unifying property of
exogenous mutagens, including UV light and chemotherapy agents in human cells and
tumours, which has profound implications for the evolution and adaptation of cancer
genomes.

Sequencing and analysis of cancer genomes has identified a wealth of driver mutations and
mutation signatures1,3. These mutation signatures have revealed how environmental
mutagens cause genetic damage and elevate cancer risk3–5. Analyses of the genes driving
carcinogenesis has identified underlying cellular deficiencies that can help direct cancer
therapies6–8. The diversity of mutation patterns identified from cancer genome sequencing is
testament to the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of exogenous and endogenous
exposures, mutational processes, and germline variation amongst patients. A recent study of
diverse human cancers identified 49 distinct single base substitution signatures, with almost
all tumours demonstrating evidence of at least three signatures3.
Such intrinsic heterogeneity leads to overlapping mutation signatures that confound our
ability to accurately disentangle the biases of DNA damage and repair, or to interpret the
dynamics of clonal expansion. Transcription coupled repair (TCR) partially reduces the
mutational burden on the actively transcribed genome, but its analysis has been inherently
limited by many factors. For example, the requirement to compile tumours of diverse
aetiologies to achieve sufficient mutations to analyse, the absence of accurate
measurements of transcription in the cell of origin, and an inability to evaluate on which
strand mutagenic lesions occur9.
We reasoned that a more controlled and genetically uniform cancer model system would
overcome some of these limitations and complement human cancer studies. By effectively
re-running cancer evolution hundreds of times, we aimed to explore the processes of
mutagenesis, DNA repair, and clonal expansion in cancer development at high resolution,
and with good statistical power.
We chemically induced liver tumours in fifteen-day-old (P15) male C3H/HeOuJ inbred mice
(subsequently C3H, n=104) using a single dose of diethylnitrosamine (DEN), thus greatly
extending our previous study10. To provide a genetic comparison and a validation dataset in
a divergent mouse strain11, we treated a cohort of CAST/EiJ mice with DEN (subsequently
CAST, n=84). Tumours were isolated 25 or 38 weeks post-DEN treatment for C3H and
CAST, respectively (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Table 1); each tumour was processed in
parallel for histopathological and DNA analysis. Tumours fulfilling the histological inclusion
criteria (Methods) proceeded to sequencing.
Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 371 independently-evolved tumours from 104
individual C3H mice (Supplementary Table 1) revealed that each diploid genome harboured
~60,000 somatic point mutations (Fig. 1b), which equates to 13 mutations per megabase
and is comparable to human cancers caused by exogenous mutagen exposure such as
tobacco smoking and UV exposure12,13. Insertion-deletion mutations, larger segmental
changes, and aneuploidies were rare (Extended Data Fig. 1a-f). The tumour genomes were
dominated (76%) by T→N/A→N mutations (where N represents any alternate nucleotide,
Fig. 1c), consistent with previous studies implicating the long-lived thymine adduct O4-ethyldeoxythymine as one of the principal mutagenic lesions generated by bioactivation of DEN in
the liver by cytochrome P450 (CYP2E1)14. Deconvolution of mutation signatures revealed, in

addition to the predominantly T→N signature (subsequently DEN1), a second signature
(DEN2) that is typically present at a low level, but prominent in a minority of tumours
(Extended Data Fig. 1g-j). DEN2 is characterised by C→T/G→A substitutions which likely
represent the other principal mutagenic adduct of DEN14, O6-ethyl-2-deoxyguanosine, which
can be repaired by the enzyme MGMT15.
Known driver mutations were identified in the EGFR/RAS/RAF pathway10,16,17 (Fig. 1d)
validating this well controlled model system of liver tumourigenesis. These exhibited a strong
propensity to be mutually exclusive: in 82% of C3H tumours only a single known driver
mutation was observed. Similar results were replicated in CAST mice, though the proportion
of driver gene usage differed (Extended Data Fig. 1i,j).

Strikingly, in each tumour genome we observed multi-megabase segments with pronounced
Watson versus Crick strand asymmetries of mutation spectra (Fig. 2). We define Watson
strand bias as an excess of T→N over A→N mutations, when called on the forward strand of
the reference genome, and the opposite as Crick strand bias. These biased regions show
23-fold (median) excess of their preferred mutation over its reverse complement. The
asymmetric segments have a median span of 55Mb and often encompass an entire
chromosome (Fig. 2a-d). The scale of these segmental asymmetries is orders of magnitude
greater than those generated by TCR9, APOBEC mutagenesis18,19 or produced by replication
strand asymmetries9,20. Despite the segmental strand asymmetry, the mutation load remains
approximately uniform across the genome (Fig. 2e) and asymmetric segments do not
correspond to deletions or other changes in DNA copy-number (Fig. 2f).
This pervasive, strand-asymmetric mutagenesis can be explained as the consequence of
DEN-induced lesions remaining unrepaired prior to genome replication. The first round of
genome replication after DEN exposure results in two sister chromatids with independent
lesions on their parent strands (Fig. 2j). The daughter strand is produced using a lesioncontaining template whose complement is synthesised with reduced replication fidelity over
damaged nucleotides, resulting in nucleotide misincorporation errors complementary to the
lesion sites. These two sister chromatids necessarily segregate into separate daughter cells
during mitosis and the heteroduplexes of lesions with paired mismatches are resolved into
full mutations by subsequent replication cycles (Fig. 2j). We subsequently refer to this
phenomenon as “lesion segregation”.
The haploid X chromosome always contains segments with either a strong Watson or Crick
bias. On autosomal chromosomes, in addition to Watson or Crick biases, we also observe an
unbiased state (Fig. 2g). We interpret this unbiased state as the aggregated biases of the
two allelic autosomal chromosomes with conflicting strand asymmetries. More explicitly,
when both copies of a chromosome have Watson strand bias, the genome shows a Watson
strand bias (e.g. chromosome 15 in Fig. 2a-c); when one copy of the autosome has Watson
bias and the other a Crick bias the two will cancel each other out and therefore appear
unbiased (e.g. chromosome 19 in Fig. 2a-c). Under lesion segregation, these asymmetries
represent the random retention of Watson or Crick strand biased segments over the whole
genome, and are essentially the output of two independent 1:1 Bernoulli processes,
analogous to two fair coin flips. In such a model, we would expect (1) 50% of the autosomal
genome and (2) 100% of the haploid X chromosome to show mutational asymmetry; both
predictions are supported by the observed data (Fig. 2g,i). A small fraction of tumours (3.5%)
are outliers (Fig. 2g,i) with absent or muted mutational asymmetry; these features are
associated with atypically low variant allele frequency distributions, indicating they may be
polyclonal or polyploid (Supplementary Table 1).
The lesion segregation model predicts mutational asymmetries should span whole
chromosomes, yet within a chromosome we commonly observe discrete switches between
multi-megabase segments of Watson and Crick strand bias (Fig. 2a-d,g). Such switches
likely represent sister chromatid exchanges resulting from homologous recombination (HR)
mediated DNA repair events21 (Extended Data Fig. 4a) that are typically invisible to

The observed rate of sister-chromatid exchange positively correlates with the genome-wide
load of point mutations (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). The presence of typically 27 (median)
sister chromatid exchanges in each of 371 diploid tumour genomes meant we were well
powered to detect recurrent exchange sites and biases in genomic context (Extended Data
Fig. 2c,d). After filtering out three genomic locations that correspond to reference genome
mis-assemblies (Fig. 2g; Extended Data Fig. 3a,b), we find that sister chromatid exchanges
occur throughout the genome, with modest enrichment in transcriptionally inactive, late
replicating regions and depletion in transcriptionally active and early replicating loci
(Extended Data Fig. 4b).
The fine mapping (~20kb resolution) of sister chromatid exchange events allowed us to test
the fidelity of HR between sister chromatids. Aggregate analysis indicated that sister
chromatid exchange sites have approximately double the rate of point mutations compared
to the remainder of the genome, suggesting HR may be an error-prone process. However
the spectrum of point mutations in these regions did not differ from the rest of the tumour
genomes (Extended Data Fig. 4c-f). A shift in spectrum would be expected if additional
mutations had been introduced during the homologous repair process, independent of the
chemically induced lesion repair. We propose that a model of Holliday intermediate branch
migration can explain these observations (Extended Data Fig. 4g and would mean that, to
the limit of our resolution, the HR process is error-free. Under this model the observed
increase in mutation rate is actually a HR driven increase in mutational diversity within the
cell population.
Lesion segregation reveals oncogenic selection
The random segregation of sister chromatids into daughter cells would result in 50% Watson
strand and 50% Crick strand lesion retention on average across tumours. The majority of the
genome conforms to this prediction (Fig. 2h). We observe striking deviations from this 50:50
ratio at loci spanning known murine hepatocellular carcinoma driver genes (Fig. 2h). For
example the Braf T→A mutation at codon 584 is a known oncogenic driver10 and observed in
153/371 of the C3H tumours. Presuming that the Braf mutation was DEN induced, we would
expect the mutation to have occurred in a chromosomal segment that retained T-lesions on
the same strand as the driver T→A change. Indeed this is the case (94%; 144/153 tumours
retain lesions on the expected strand, Fisher’s exact test p=3.6x10-19, rejecting the 50:50 null
expectation). In contrast, we would not expect tumours lacking the Braf mutation to show a
systematic bias in the lesion strands retained at this genomic locus, and our observations
again match expectations (47% Crick bias, 53% Watson bias, p=0.88, not rejecting the 50:50
null expectation). We applied this general test for oncogenic selection at sites with sufficient
recurrent mutations to have statistical power. Our results confirmed significant oncogenic
selection of previously identified driver mutations in Hras, Braf and Egfr, but did not support it
at two other recurrently (n>33) mutated sites, demonstrating the specificity of this test
(Extended Data Table 1).

DNA repair with lesion strand resolution
Resolving DNA lesions to specific strands in a single mutagenised cell cycle presents a
unique opportunity to investigate strand-specific interactions with DNA damage and repair in
vivo, such as quantifying the efficiency and biases of TCR. Transcription-coupled nucleotide
excision repair specifically removes DNA lesions from the mRNA template strand rather than
from the non-template strand in expressed genes (Fig. 3a)23,24. To explore this, we generated
total transcriptomes of liver tissue from P15 C3H and CAST mice, corresponding to the
known tissue of origin as well as the exact developmental timing of DEN mutagenesis.
For each gene in each tumour, we resolved whether the lesion strand was the mRNA
template or non-template strand, and calculated mutation rates stratified by both expression
level and lesion strand (Fig. 3b). As expected, TCR was highly specific to the template
strand and correlated closely with gene expression. Among genes without detectable
expression, there was no reduction or observable transcription strand-bias in the mutation
rate. In contrast, the mutation rate of the most highly expressed genes was reduced by
79.8±1.0% if the tumour inherited lesions on the template strand. We also detect a small
transcription-associated decrease in mutation rate for lesions on the non-template strand:
10.7±1.4% reduction in rate relative to lowly-expressed genes.
We next considered the specificity of TCR, comparing the rates of mutation for each
trinucleotide context (n=64 categories) between template and non-template strands, stratified
by expression level (Fig. 3c,d). All measures are rates, thus taking into account sequence
composition differences between sets of genes and DNA strands. The most common
mutations (T→N), have an 82% (s.d. 6.8% across sequence contexts) lower rate on the
template strand than the non-template strand for highly expressed genes; the non-template
mutation rate is the same regardless of expression level (Fig. 3d, dark-blue lines are close to
vertical), consistent with expectations23.
Mutations from C and G on the template strand also show a high efficiency of TCR (70%
(s.d. 7.8%) and 34% (s.d. 21%) respectively, Fig. 3d). For these mutation classes, however,
there is also a consistent transcription-dependent reduction of mutation rate when the lesions
are inferred to be on the non-template strand (lines are deflected left, rather than vertical).
This may indicate the targeting of non-transcription coupled repair processes to accessible
genic regions. Notably, though comparatively rare, mutations from adenine on the lesion
containing strand are increased with transcription (Fig. 3d). This unexpected observation
could be due to the activity of error-prone trans-lesion DNA polymerase Pol-η which targets
transcribed regions, where it is known to promote mutations specifically at A:T base-pairs25.
Prior analyses of transcription coupled repair could not resolve the lesion containing
strand9,23,26. Consistent with these previous findings, we observe reduced mutation rates
broadly across the transcription start site (TSS) region and into the body of active genes
(Fig. 3e). A notable feature of this profile is the relative increase in mutation rate for the core
promoter located in the 200 nucleotides immediately upstream of the TSS27. Including lesion
strand information in the analysis (Fig. 3f) shows the relative increase in mutation rate over
the core promoter to be a result of high rates of TCR upstream and downstream, but a
relative depletion of TCR activity over the promoter itself, results that are replicated in CAST

active promoters28 in shaping the observed mutation patterns.

Lesion segregation generates genetic diversity
The lesion segregation model (Fig. 2j) predicts that a segregating lesion may template
multiple rounds of replication in successive cell cycles. In such a scenario, each replication
across the lesion could incorporate different incorrectly paired nucleotides - or even the
correctly paired nucleotide - opposite a persistent lesion. Consistent with this notion,
hundreds of multi-allelic mutations have recently been reported from single cell sequencing
of human cancer samples29.
We investigated the extent of multi-allelic variation within our data by analysing the
sequencing reads at the sites of identified mutations. For example, a nucleotide position with
multiple high-confidence reads supporting a reference T, mutation to A and also mutation to
C would be considered multi-allelic. We find that on average 8% of mutated sites in DEN
induced tumours exhibit evidence of multi-allelic variants (n=1.8 million sites across our C3H
data set), though this value ranges from <1% to 25.7% between tumours (Fig. 4a). As a
control we performed equivalent analysis on sites that had been called as mutated in a
randomly selected proxy tumour (Methods). On average, only 0.098% (95% CI: 0.0430.25%) of these control sites show evidence of non-reference nucleotides by the same
criteria.
We further validated the multi-allelic variant calls from whole genome sequencing within
independently performed deep exome sequencing of the same tumours10. The second and
subsequent alternate alleles show the same profile of read depth-dependent validation rate
as the called mutant allele, and clear separation from control analyses with mis-paired
exome and genome sequence (Fig. 4b).
The independent generation of multi-allelic variation at sites across the genome produces
combinatorial genetic diversity that is not expected under a model of purely clonal expansion.
This combinatorial diversity can be directly visualised in pairs of mutated sites close enough
to be spanned by individual sequencing reads (Fig. 4c,d). Analysis of such reads
demonstrates the presence of combinations of alleles between bi-allelic sites that requires
lesions to have been replicated over, without generating a mutation in some cell divisions
(Fig. 4d). As expected for orthogonal measures of the generated genetic diversity, the
tumour-wide level of combinatorial diversity from such proximal mutation pairs is closely
correlated with the multi-allelic rate (Fig. 4e), and highlights the consistently high variance of
these measures between tumours.

295

300

305

The explanation for this inter-tumour variance becomes evident when plotting the distribution
of multi-allelism along each tumour genome (Fig. 4f-i). Tumours with high rates of genetic
diversity typically have uniformly high rates of multi-allelism across their genome (Fig. 4g).
They likely developed from a first generation daughter of the original DEN mutagenised cell,
in which all DNA is a duplex of a lesion containing and non-lesion containing strand.
Replication over lesion containing strands in subsequent generations therefore produces
multi-allelic variation at a uniform rate throughout the genome.
Tumours with lower total levels of genetic diversity exhibit discrete genomic segments of high
and low multi-allelism (Fig. 4h,i). These tumours can be explained as having developed from

a cell a few generations subsequent to DEN treatment. Each mitosis following DEN exposure
is expected to dilute the lesion containing strands present in each daughter cell by
approximately 50% per generation, assuming random segregation. Only fractions of the
genome retaining the lesions will go on to generate multi-allelic and combinatorial genetic
diversity in the daughter lineages. As expected from the lesion segregation model with sister
chromatid exchange, the multi-allelic patterns mirror the mutational asymmetry segmentation
pattern. Tumours with uniformly low levels of multi-allelism can similarly be explained as
having developed from a still later generation cell that had not inherited any lesion containing
strands.

315

320

325

By estimating the fraction of chromosomal segments that are multi-allelic, we can infer the
cell generation post-DEN exposure that the tumour grew from (Fig. 4j). This indicates that
67% of C3H and 21% of CAST tumours developed from the first generation daughter cell
following DEN exposure, indicating the single large burst of mutations was instantly
transformative. For the remainder, the observed fractions of multi-allelic segments cluster
around expectations for second and subsequent cell generations, suggesting that either an
additional mutational hit, the generation of a specific mutation allele combination, or an
external trigger is required for transformation. Intriguingly, there is a bias in driver gene
usage between early and late transforming tumours (Fig. 4k) with Egfr driven tumours
significantly later to transform. Analysis of the mutational landscape from lesion segregation
revealed novel mechanisms of generating and sampling genetic diversity, as well as giving
insights into the earliest events in oncogenesis.

Lesion segregation is ubiquitous

Lesion segregation is a major feature of DEN mutagenesis in mouse liver. This immediately
raises two important questions: are other DNA damaging agents also characterised by lesion
segregation? And does lesion segregation occur in human cells and cancers? A recent study
exposed human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to 79 known or suspected
environmental mutagens and found 41 of them produced nucleotide substitutions above
background expectations5. Although not previously noted in these data, we found that many
of these mutagenic exposures generated chromosome-scale lesion segregation patterns in
the same manner as our in vivo DEN model (Fig. 5a; Extended Data Fig. 6a-d).
To allow generalised searching of genomic mutation data, we identified the most common
nucleotide substitution type in each sample (e.g. C→T/G→A in simulated solar radiation
exposure, Fig. 5a) and applied runs-based tests to quantify the segmental asymmetry of
those informative mutations. The application of runs-based tests (e.g. the rl20 metric) (Fig.
5b-f) revealed that segmental mutational asymmetry is a common feature of DNA damaging
mutagens (Fig. 5d). We detect significant mutational asymmetry in every sample with good
statistical power (>1,000 informative mutations, Fig. 5g), including multiple clinically relevant
insults, including sunlight (simulated solar radiation, SSR), tobacco smoke (BPDE) and
chemotherapeutic agents (temozolomide). We conclude that the chromosome-scale
segregation of lesions and the resulting strand asymmetry of mutation patterns is a general
feature of all tested DNA damaging mutagens.

In prior work from the same laboratory as Kucab et al., components of the mismatch repair
pathway were disabled and other mutator phenotypes were genetically engineered. These
experiments all generate mutations through mechanisms that are independent of DNA
damage30. Cells were grown from single clones, sequenced and analysed as for the iPSC
mutagenesis data, and showed a similar range of mutation counts. As their mutations are
independent of DNA lesions, they were not expected to show lesion segregation patterns.
Confirming this expectation no significant asymmetry was detected (Fig. 5e).
A common feature of our DEN mutagenesis experiment and mutagen exposure in human
IPS cells5 is the application of a single mutagenic insult. Our lesion segregation model
predicts that mutagen exposures over multiple cell cycles would progressively mask the
mutational strand asymmetry pattern as independent patterns are successively
superimposed. Most exogenous mutagens implicated in the pathogenesis of human cancers
are encountered as repeated episodic exposures, for example smoking or UV exposure.
Therefore, even though we have shown that UV exposure does cause lesion segregation in
human cells (Fig. 5a) it is unlikely that the mutational asymmetry diagnostic of lesion
segregation would be detected in skin cancers.
Despite the low prior expectation of detecting lesion segregation patterns in clinical human
cancers, we used the same algorithm as for human iPS cells to analyse the cancer genomes
from the International Cancer Genome Consortium3 (n=19,778 cancers from 22 cancer
primary sites). This analysis identified multiple cancers that are highly significant (Fig. 5f) and
clearly show mutational asymmetry patterns characteristic of lesion segregation (Extended
Data Fig. 7a-c). The majority of these tumours are renal, hepatic or biliary in origin, and

show a high mutation rate and strand asymmetry of T→A/A→T mutations, consistent with
known aristolochic acid exposure3 (Supplementary Table 2). We conclude that lesion
segregation is likely to be a general feature of mammalian cells with episodic or continuous
exposure to mutagens, though visualised most clearly in homogenous cell populations
subjected to single doses of a mutagen.

Discussion
Here we show that most mutagenic DNA lesions are not resolved as mutations within a
single cell-cycle. Instead, lesions segregate unrepaired into daughter cells for multiple
cellular generations, resulting in the chromosome-scale strand asymmetry of subsequent
mutations. Initially discovered in a well-powered in vivo model of oncogenesis, we also
demonstrate that lesion segregation is ubiquitous to all tested mutagens, occurs in human
cells, and is evident in human cancers. The striking pattern of mutation asymmetry that we
observe occurs as a result of a single mutagenic treatment. Since most cancers are subject
to multiple damaging events over their life history, they will acquire new waves of segregating
lesions after each exposure, thus resulting in mutually confounding mutation patterns.
Hence, although the mutation asymmetry pattern is most pronounced in bulk sequencing of
liver and kidney cancers in human cohorts, lesion segregation has likely shaped all genomes
that have suffered DNA damage, which has important implications for tumour evolution and
heterogeneity.
The lesion segregation model makes several predictions, which we confirmed in our
experimental results in both C3H and CAST mice, and are further validated in published
human datasets. As predicted for the random segregation of lesion strands, segmental
asymmetry is present throughout the haploid X chromosome and 50% of the remaining
genome. While the genome-wide pattern of strand retention within and between tumours is
random, it is focally biased over regions containing driver genes, which itself provides a novel
approach to detect oncogenic selection. The persistence of lesions for more than one cellular
generation predicts the presence of multi-allelic sites, which are abundant in our in vivo
experimental system, and were recently described in smaller numbers in human cancers29
and a well-controlled cell lineage tracking system31.

Our discovery of pervasive lesion segregation challenges long standing assumptions in the
analysis of cancer evolution32. For example, the widely used infinite sites model33 does not
allow for recurrent rounds of mutation at the same site, such as those generated by
segregating lesions. It also provides new opportunities for understanding cancer evolution,
through the use of the mutational asymmetry and multi-allelic-rate patterns to track events
during oncogenesis and, in some instances, to quantify selection. A far-reaching implication
of lesion segregation is that it may provide a window of opportunity for a cancer to sample
the fitness of mutation combinations within the lineage, circumventing Muller’s ratchet34 and
Hill-Robertson interference: low efficiency of selection due to the inability to separate
mutations of opposing fitness effects35,36. Consequently, DNA damaging chemotherapeutics,
particularly large or closely spaced doses that generate persistent lesions, could
inadvertently provide an opportunity for efficient selection of the resulting mutations. This
insight may guide the development of more effective chemotherapeutic regimens.
Consistent with our initial motivation, the ability to resolve lesion strandedness has enabled
more refined analyses of DNA damage and repair processes. For example, our analysis of
transcription coupled repair revealed with unforeseen clarity how frequent bidirectional
transcription shapes the distribution of mutations at transcription start sites. Our data also
afforded high resolution mapping of sister chromatid exchange events, quantifying for the

first time the increased mutational diversity at sites of homology driven repair. Both of these
practical applications of lesion segregation provide new vistas for the exploration of genome
maintenance and fundamental molecular biology.
Once identified, lesion segregation is a deeply intuitive concept. DNA damage and lesion
formation occurs independently on the Watson and Crick strands and those surviving DNA
repair persist through mitosis. Replication over these segregating lesions generates
combinatorial genetic diversity, thus providing opportunities for selection and adaptation long
assumed to be impossible in a clonally expanding population. The discovery of pervasive
lesion segregation profoundly revises our understanding of how the architecture of DNA
repair and clonal proliferation can conspire to shape the cancer genome.

Mouse colony management
Animal experimentation was carried out in accordance with the Animals (Scientific
Procedures) Act 1986 (United Kingdom) and with the approval of the Cancer Research UK
Cambridge Institute Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body (AWERB). Animals were
maintained using standard husbandry: mice were group housed in Tecniplast GM500 IVC
cages with a 12-hour light / 12-hour dark cycle and ad libitum access to water, food (LabDiet
5058), and enrichments.
Chemical model of hepatocarcinogenesis

15-day-old (P15) male C3H and CAST mice were treated with a single intraperitoneal (IP)
injection of N-Nitrosodiethylamine (DEN; Sigma-Aldrich N0258; 20 mg/kg body weight)
diluted in 0.85% saline. Liver tumour samples were collected from DEN-treated mice 25
weeks (C3H) or 38 weeks (CAST) after treatment. All macroscopically identified tumours
were isolated and processed in parallel for DNA extraction and histopathological
examination. Non-tumour tissue from untreated P15 mice (ear, tail, and background liver)
was sampled for control experiments.
Tissue collection and processing

575

580

Liver tumours of sufficient size (≥2 mm diameter) were bisected; one half was flash frozen in
liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C for DNA extraction, and the other half was processed for
histology. Tissue samples for histology were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 24 h,
transferred to 70% ethanol, machine processed (Leica ASP300 Tissue Processor; Leica,
Wetzlar, Germany), and paraffin embedded. All formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
sections were 3 μm in thickness.
Histochemical staining
FFPE tissue sections were haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained using standard laboratory
techniques. Histochemical staining was performed using the automated Leica ST5020;
mounting was performed on the Leica CV5030.

585

Imaging
Tissue sections were digitised using the Aperio XT system (Leica Biosystems) at 20x
resolution; all H&E images are available in the BioStudies archive at EMBL-EBI under
accession S-BSST129.

Tumour histopathology

595

H&E sections of liver tumours were blinded and assessed twice by a pathologist (S.J.A);
discordant results were reviewed by an independent hepatobiliary pathologist (S.E.D).
Tumours were classified according to the International Harmonization of Nomenclature and
Diagnostic Criteria for Lesions in Rats and Mice (INHAND) guidelines 37. In addition, tumour
grade, size, morphological subtype, nature of steatosis, and mitotic index were assessed

or vascular invasion.
Sample selection for WGS
600

605

Tumours which met the following histological criteria were selected for whole genome
sequencing (C3H n=371, CAST n=84): (i) diagnosis of either dysplastic nodule (DN) or
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), (ii) homogenous tumour morphology, (iii) tumour cell
percentage >70%, and (iv) adequate tissue for DNA extraction. Neoplasms with extensive
necrosis, mixed tumour types, a nodule-in-nodule appearance (indicative of an HCC arising
within a DN), or contamination by normal liver tissue were excluded. Since carcinogeninduced tumours arising in the same liver are independent 10, multiple tumours were selected
from each mouse to minimise the number of animals used. A subset of normal (non-tumour)
samples from untreated mice were also sequenced (C3H n=13, CAST n=7).

Whole genome sequencing

615

Genomic DNA was isolated from liver tissue and liver tumours using the AllPrep 96
DNA/RNA Kit (Qiagen, 80311) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA quality was
assessed on a 1% agarose gel and quantified using the Quant-IT dsDNA Broad Range Kit
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). Genomic DNA was sheared using a Covaris LE220 focusedultrasonicator to a 450 bp mean insert size.

620

625

WGS libraies were generated from 1 μg of 50 ng/ul high molecular weight gDNA using the
TruSeq PCR-free Library Prep Kit (Illumina), according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Library fragment size was determined using a Caliper GX Touch with a HT DNA 1k/12K/Hi
Sensitivity LabChip and HT DNA Hi Sensitivity Reagent Kit to ensure 300-800 bp (target
~450 bp).
Libraries were quantified by real-time PCR using the Kapa library quantification kit (Kapa
Biosystems) on a Roche LightCycler 480. 0.75 nM libraries were pooled in 6-plex and
sequenced on a HiSeq X Ten (Illumina) to produce paired-end 150 bp reads. Each pool of 6
libraries was sequenced over eight lanes (minimum of 40x coverage).
Variant calling and somatic mutation filtering

630

Sequencing reads were aligned to respective genome assemblies (C3H = C3H_HeJ_v1;
CAST = CAST_EiJ_v1) 38 with bwa-mem (v.0.7.12) 39 using default parameters. Reads were
annotated to read groups using the picard (v.1.124) 40 tool AddOrReplaceReadGroups, and
minor annotation inconsistencies corrected using the picard CleanSam and
FixMateInformation tools . Bam files were merged as necessary, and duplicate reads were
annotated using the picard tool MarkDuplicates.

635

640

Single nucleotide variants were called using Strelka2 (v.2.8.4) 41 implementing default
parameters. Initial variant annotation was performed with the GATK (v.3.8.0) 42 walker
CalculateSNVMetrics 43. Genotype calls with a variant allele frequency < 0.025 were
removed. Although inbred strains were used, fixed genetic differences between the colonies
and the reference genome, as well as small numbers of germline variants segregating within

the colonies were identified. For each strain, fixed differences were identified as homozygous
changes present in 100% of genotyped samples were filtered out. Segregating variants were
filtered based on the excess clustering of mutations to animals with shared mothers. To
generate a null expectation taking into account the family structure of the colonies, the
parent-offspring relationships were randomly permuted 1,000 times. For each count of
recurrent mutation (range 5 to 371 inclusive), we determined the null distribution of expected
distinct mothers. Comparing this to the observed count of distinct mothers for each recurrent
(n>4) mutation, those with a low probability (p<1x10-4, pnorm function from R (v.3.5.1) 44)
under the null were excluded from analyses.

650
Copy number variation between tumours within strains was called using CNVkit (v.0.9.6) 45.
Non-tumour reference coverage was provided from non-tumour control WGS data (C3H
n=11, CAST n=7) and per tumour cellularity estimates (see below) were provided.

RNA-sequencing
Total RNA was extracted from P15 liver tissue (n=4 biological replicates per strain) using
QIAzol Lysis Reagent (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNase
treatment and removal were performed using the TURBO DNA-freeTM Kit (Ambion, Life
Technologies), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentration was
measured using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher); RNA integrity was
assessed on a Total RNA Nano Chip Bioanalyzer (Agilent)
Total RNA (1 μg) was used to generate sequencing libraries using the TruSeq Stranded
Total RNA Library Prep Kit with Ribo-Zero Gold (Illumina), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Library fragment size was determined using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent).
Libraries were quantified by qPCR (Kapa Biosystems). Pooled libraries were sequenced on a
HiSeq4000 to produce ≥40 million paired-end 150 bp reads per library.

Transcript abundances were quantified with Kallisto (v.0.43.1)46 (using the flag --bias) and a
transcriptome index compiled from coding and non-coding cDNA sequences defined in
Ensembl v9147. Transcripts per million (TPM) estimates were generated for each annotated
transcript and summed across alternate transcripts of the same gene for gene-level analysis.
Transcription start sites (TSS) for each gene were annotated with Ensembl v91 and based
upon the most abundantly expressed transcript. RNA-seq data are available at Array
Express at EMBL-EBI under accession E-MTAB-8518.
Genomic annotation data

Mouse liver proximity ligation sequencing (HiC) data were downloaded from GEO
(GSE65126) 48, replicates were combined, then aligned to GRCm38 49 and processed using
the Juicebox (v.7.5) and Juicer scripts 50 to obtain the HiC matrix. Eigenvectors were
obtained for 500kb consecutive genomic windows over each chromosome from the HiC
matrix using Juicebox and subsequently oriented (to distinguish compartment A from B)
using GC content per 500kb bin. We used progressiveCactus 51 to project the 500kb

windows into the C3H reference genome and Bedtools (v.2.28.0) to merge syntenic loci
between 450 and 550 kb in size, removing the second instance where we observed overlaps.
Genic annotation was obtained from Ensembl v91 47for the corresponding C3H and CAST
reference genome assemblies (C3H_HeJ_v1, CAST_EiJ_v1). Genomic repeat elements
were annotated using RepeatMasker (v.20170127) 52 with the default parameters and
libraries for mouse annotation.
The analysable fraction of the genome

705

Analysis and sequence composition calculations were confined to the main chromosome
assemblies of the reference genome (chromosomes 1-19 and X). Using WGS of non-tumour
liver, ear and tail samples (C3H n=11, CAST n=7) collected and sequenced
contemporaneously with tumour samples, genome sequencing coverage was calculated for
1kb windows using multicov in Bedtools (v.2.28.0) 53. Windows with read coverage >2 s.d.
from the autosomal mean were flagged as suspect in each tumour. Read coverage over the
X chromosome was doubled in these calculations to account for the expected hemizygosity
in these male mice. Any 1kb window identified as suspect in >90% of these non-tumour
samples was flagged as “abnormal read coverage” (ARC) and masked from subsequent
analysis. This masked 12.7% of the C3H and 11.5% of the CAST reference genomes
yielding analysable haploid genome sizes of C3H = 2,333,783,789 nt and CAST =
2,331,370,397 nt.
Mutation rate calculations

710

715

720

Mutation rates were calculated as 192 category vectors representing every possible single
nucleotide substitution conditioned on the identity of the upstream and downstream
nucleotides. Each rate being the observed count of a mutation category divided by the count
of the trinucleotide context in the analysed sequence. To report a single aggregate mutation
rate, the three rates for each trinucleotide context were summed to give a 64 category vector
and the weighted mean of that vector reported as the mutation rate. The vector of weights
being the trinucleotide sequence frequency of a reference sequence, for example the
composition of the whole genome. In the case of whole genome analysis, the same
trinucleotide counts are used in (1) the individual category rates calculation and (2) the
weighted mean of the rates, cancelling out. For windowed comparisons of mutation rates, the
weighted mean is calculated using the genome wide composition of trinucleotides rather than
the local sequence composition, providing a compositionally adjusted mutation rate estimate.
For mutation rates in TCR analysis, the same compositional adjustment was carried out but
using the trinucleotide composition of the aggregate genic spans of genome (minus ARC
regions) for normalisation.
Mutation signatures

725

The 96 category “folded” mutation counts for each of the 371 C3H tumours were
deconvolved into the best fitting number (K) of component signatures using sigFit (v.2.0) 54
with 1,000 iterations and K set to integers 2 to 8 inclusive. A heuristic goodness of fit score
based on cosine similarity favoured instances where K=2. The DEN1 and DEN2 signatures
reported were obtained by running sigFit with 30,000 iterations for K=2. Analysis of CAST

tumours gave less distinct separation of signatures so the C3H derived DEN1 and DEN2
were used for both strains. To fit signatures to each tumour we used sigFit provided with the
DEN signatures and additional SPONT1 and SPONT2 signatures that were derived from
equivalent WGS analysis of spontaneous (non-DEN induced) C3H tumours.

735

Driver mutation identification
Driver mutations in the known oncogenic driver genes Egfr, Braf, Hras, and Kras were
previously identified for C3H 10 and the orthologous mutations identified in CAST derived
tumours were annotated as driver mutations.

740

750

Mutational asymmetry segmentation and scoring
For each tumour a focal subset of “informative” mutation types were defined, T→N/A→N
mutations, in the case of DEN-induced tumours. The order of focal mutations along each
chromosome was represented as a binary vector (e.g. 0 for T→N, 1 for A→N). Vectors
corresponding to each chromosome of each tumour were processed with the cpt.mean
function of the R Changepoint (v.2.2.2) 55 package run with an Akaike information criterion
(AIC) penalty function, maximum number of changepoints set to 12 (Q=12), and
implementing the PELT algorithm for optimal changepoint detection. Following segmentation,
the defined segments were scored for strand asymmetry, taking into account the sequence
composition of the segment. For example in tumours with T→N/A→N informative mutations
the number of Ts on the forward strand is the count of Watson sites GW and the number of
T→N mutations is μW which together give the Watson strand rate RW=μW/GW. The forward
strand count of As and mutations from A likewise give the Crick strand rate RC=μC/GC. From
these two rates we calculate a relative difference metric, the mutational asymmetry score
S=(RW -RC)/(RW+RC) .

755

760

765

770

The parameter S scales from 1 all Watson (e.g. DEN T→N mutations) through 0 (50:50
T→N:A→N) to -1 for all Crick (e.g. DEN A→N). For the categorical assignment, S ≥ 0.3 is
Watson strand asymmetric, S ≤ -0.3 Crick strand asymmetric and in the range -0.3 < S < 0.3
symmetric, though more stringent filtering was applied where noted. Segments containing
<20 informative mutations were discarded from subsequent analyses.
To test for oncogenic selection at sites with recurrent mutations, mutational asymmetry
segments overlapping the focal mutation were categorised based on their asymmetry score
S, as above. The test was implemented as a Fisher’s exact test with the 2x2 contingency
table comprising the counts chromosomes (two autosomes per cell) stratified by Watson
versus Crick asymmetry and the presence of the focal mutation in the tumour. Tumours
containing another known driver gene or recurrent mutation within the focal asymmetry
segment were discarded from the analysis. We estimated the minimum recurrence of a
mutation necessary to reliably detect oncogenic selection through simulation. Biased
segregation of chromosomes containing drivers was modelled using the observed median
excess of T→N over A→N lesions (23 fold), and random segregation of non-driver containing
strands (1:1 ratio). Our model predicted >33 C3H recurrences or >41 CAST recurrences
would give 80% power to detect oncogenic selection if present.

Tumour cellularity estimates
We calculated tumour cellularity as a function of the non-reference read count in autosomal
chromosomes (1-R/d)*2 where R is the reference read count at a mutated site and d is the
total read depth at the site. For each tumour these values were binned in percentiles and the
midpoint of the most populated (modal) percentile taken as the estimated cellularity of the
tumour. Given the low rate of copy number variation across the DEN induced tumours, no
correction was made for copy-number distortion.

Since lesion segregation, mutation asymmetry patterns allow the long-range phasing of
chromosome strands, they can detect discrepancies in sequence order and orientation
between the sequenced genomes and the reference. We identified autosomal asymmetry
segments that immediately transitioned from Watson bias (S > 0.3) to Crick (S < -0.3) or vice
versa without occupying the intermediate unbiased state (-0.3 > S < 0.3); such “discordant
segments” are unexpected. Allowing for ±100kb uncertainty in the position of each exchange
site we produced the discordant segment coverage metric. At sites with discordant segment
coverage >1 we calculated percentage consensus for mis-assembly M=ds/(ds+cs) where ds
is the number of discordant segments over the exchange site and cs the number of
concordant: where either Watson or Crick mutational asymmetry extends at least 1x106
nucleotides on both sides of the exchange site.
Sister chromatid exchange site analysis
Identified sister chromatid exchange sites were aggregated across tumours from each strain.
Exchange sites within 1x106 nt of known and proposed reference genome mis-assembly
sites were excluded from analysis. The mid-point between the flanking informative mutations
was taken as the reference genome position of the exchange event, and the distance
between those flanking mutations as the positional uncertainty of the estimate. To generate
null expectations for mutation rate measures, the coordinate of an exchange was projected
into the genome of a proxy tumour and the mutation rates and patterns measured from that
proxy tumour (repeated 100 times). The permutation of tumour identifiers for the selection of
proxy tumours was a shuffle without replacement that preserved the total number of
exchange sites measured in each tumour.
The comparison of mutation spectra between windows was calculated as the cosine distance
between the 96 category trinucleotide context mutation spectra for the whole genome and
that calculated for the aggregated 5kb window. The 96 categories were equally weighted for
this comparison.
Exchange site enrichment analysis used Bedtools 53 shuffle to permute the genomic positions
of exchange sites into the analysable fraction of the genome (defined above). Observed
rates of annotation overlap were compared to the distribution of values from 1,000 permuted
exchange sites. For genic overlaps we used Ensembl v91 47 coordinates for genic spans;
gene expression status was based on the summed expression over all annotated transcripts
for the gene from P15 liver from the matched mouse strain. Expression thresholds were
defined as >50th centile for active and <50th centile for inactive genes.

Transcription coupled repair calculations
For each protein coding gene, the maximally expressed transcript isoform was identified from
P15 liver in the matched strain (TPM expression), subsequently the primary transcripts. In
the case of ties, transcript selection was arbitrary. Genes were partitioned into five categories
based on the expression of the primary transcript: expression level 0 (<0.0001 TPM) and four
quartiles of detected expression.
Using the segmental asymmetry patterns of each tumour and the annotated coordinates
(Ensembl v91) of the selected transcripts, we identified transcripts completely contained in a
single Watson or Crick asymmetric segment and located at least 200kb from the segment
boundary at both ends. We also applied strict asymmetry criteria of mutational asymmetry
scores S > 0.8 for Watson and S < -0.8 for Crick asymmetry segments, though analysis with
the standard asymmetry thresholds and no segment boundary margin give similar results
and identical conclusions. For each transcript in each tumour we then used both the
transcriptional orientation of the gene and the mutational asymmetry of the segment
containing it to resolve the segregated lesions to either the template (anti-sense) or nontemplate (sense) strand of the gene. Transcripts contained in mutationally symmetric regions
or not meeting the strict filtering criteria were excluded from analysis.

840

We then analysed mutation rates stratifying by gene expression level and the template/nontemplate strand of the lesions but aggregating between tumours within the same strain. The
transcription start site coordinates used correspond to the annotated 5’ end of the primary
transcripts.

Multi-allelic variation

850

855

Aligned reads spanning genomic positions of somatic mutations were genotyped using
Samtools mpileup (v.1.9) 56. Genotypes supported by ≥2 reads with a nucleotide quality
score of ≥20 were reported, considering sites with two alleles as biallelic, those with three or
four alleles as multi-allelic. The fraction of called mutations exhibiting multi-allelic variation
was calculated for the analysable fraction of the genome, across 10Mb consecutive windows
and also for each of the mutational asymmetry segments calculated for each tumour.
A null expectation for the multi-allelic rate estimate was generated per C3H tumour; genomic
positions identified as mutated across the other 370 tumours were down-sampled to match
the mutation count in the focal tumour. Any of these proxy mutation sites with a nonreference genotype supported by ≥2 reads and nucleotide quality score ≥20 at the focal site
were referred to as “multi-allelic” for the purposes of defining a background expectation for
the calling of multi-allelic variation. For each tumour, this was repeated 100 times and the
mean reported.

865

We used whole exome sequencing (WES) of fifteen C3H tumours from 10) that have
subsequently been used to generate WGS data in this study as a basis for validating multiallelic calls. Multi-allelic variant positions derived from WGS were genotyped in WES using
Samtools mpileup, as described above. Only sites with ≥30x WES coverage were considered
and alleles were found to be concordant if a WGS genotype was supported by ≥1 read in the

WES data. To provide a null expectation, the analysis was repeated using WES data from a
different tumour and validation rates reported for all versus all combinations of mismatched
WGS-WES pairs (152-15=210).
870

To quantify combinatorial genetic diversity for each tumour, pairs of mutations located
between 3-150nt apart were phased using sequencing reads that traversed both mutation
sites. Distinct allelic combinations were counted after extraction with Samtools mpileup using
only reads with nucleotide quality score ≥20 over both mutation sites.

Estimating the cell generation of transformation

Knowing the faction of lesion segregation segments that generated multi-allelic variation
across a tumour genome allows the inference of the generation time post-mutagenesis of the
cell from which the tumour developed, because each successive cell generation is expected
to retain only 50% of the lesion containing segments. We estimate this fraction as follows.
Let p denote the fraction of multi-allelic segments and let q be its complement, i.e. the
fraction of non-multi-allelic segments, for each tumour genome. Segment boundaries being
sister chromatid exchange sites or chromosome boundaries. In order to determine p, we repurpose the quadratic Hardy-Weinberg equation: p+q=p2+2pq+q2 =1, which holds since the
two possible fractions need to sum to unity. Given an asymmetric segment of interest in the
diploid genome, there are 3 distinct scenarios: (i) both chromosomes are multi-allelic (p2), (ii)
One of the chromosomes is multi-allelic and the other is not (pq+qp) and (iii) both
chromosomes are non-multi-allelic (q2). The first two scenarios are not distinguishable from
the data as both appear multi-allelic (m). However, in the third scenario, for a segment to be
non-multi-allelic (biallelic, b), both chromosomal copies have to be non-multi-allelic. As
described below, q2 can be estimated directly from the data and is subsequently used to
estimate p=1-sqrt(q2) and hence the cell generation number of transformation postmutagenesis.
The estimation of q2 requires computing the ratio q2=b/(b+m). We can directly observe the
counts of b as non-multi-allelic segments. The number of autosomal chromosome pairs
(n=19) and count of sister chromatid exchange events (x) give the total number of segments
in the genome b+m=n+x. Exchange events are not expected to align between allelic
chromosomes which will result in the partial overlap of segments between allelic copies.
Although this increases the number of observed segments (b and m) relative to actual
segments, assuming the independent behaviour of allelic chromosomes and that segment
length is independent of multi-allelic state, this partial overlap does not systematically distort
the quantification of b or the estimation of q2.
To call a non-multi-allelic segment (b) we require less than 4% multi-allelic sites. The
threshold based on the tri-modal frequency distribution of multi-allelic rates per-segment,
aggregated over all 371 C3H tumours. The 4% threshold separates the lower distribution of
multi-allelic rates from the mid and higher distributions.
To test for the enrichment of specific driver gene mutations in early generation versus late
generation transformation post-DEN treatment, we applied Fisher’s exact test (fisher.test
function in R) to compare the generation 1 ratio of tumours with, versus those without, a focal

mutation to the same ratio for tumours inferred to have transformed in a later generation. We
report the same odds ratios calculated requiring that the “with focal mutation” tumours had a
driver mutation in only one of the driver genes: Hras, Braf, or Egfr.
Cell-line and human cancer mutation analysis

920

Somatic mutation calls were obtained from DNA maintenance and repair pathway perturbed
human cells 30. Of the 128,054 reported single nucleotide variants, 6,587 unique mutations
(genomic site and specific change) were shared between two or more sister clones, so likely
represent mutations present but not detected in the parental clone. All occurrences of the
shared mutations were filtered out leaving 106,688 mutations for analysis, although the
inclusion of these filtered mutations does not alter any conclusions drawn. Somatic mutation
calls from mutagen exposed cells 5 were obtained, no additional filtering was applied to these
sub-clone mutations.

Somatic mutation calls from the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) 57 were
obtained as simple_somatic_mutation.open.* files from release 28 of the consortium, one file
for each project. These somatic mutations have been called from a mixture of whole genome
and whole exome sequencing. Of the 18,965 patients represented (and not embargoed in
the release 28 dataset), 116 were excluded from analysis; these represent a distinct whole
exome sequenced subset of the LICA-CN project that appear to show a processing artefact
in the distribution of specific mutation subsets. ICGC mutations were filtered to remove
insertion and deletion mutations and also filtered for redundancy so that each mutation was
only reported once for each patient.
The rl20 metric and runs tests
Amongst only the informative mutations (e.g. T→N/A→N in DEN) three consecutive T→N
without an intervening A→N is a run of three. The R function rle was used to encode the runlengths for binary vectors of informative mutations along the genome of a focal tumour.
Ranking them from the longest to the shortest run, we find the set of longest runs that
encompass 20% of all informative mutations in the tumour. The run-length of the shortest of
those is reported as the rl20 metric. The threshold percent of mutations was defined as having
to be less than 50%, as on average only 50% of the autosomal genomes are expected to
show mutational asymmetry patterns. On testing with randomised data, the value of 20%
gave a stable null expectation (maximum observed value of a run of five) and still
encompassed a large fraction of the informative mutations. All rl20 results reported were
implemented so that runs were broken when crossing chromosome boundaries.
The Wald-Wolfowitz runs test was performed using the runs.test function of the R randtests
(v.1.0) 58 library. It was applied to binary vectors of informative changes as described above,
with threshold=0.5.
The Wald-Wolfowitz runs test significance is inflated by coordinated dinucleotide changes,
such as those produced by UV light exposure and also other local mutational asymmetries
such as replication asymmetry 9 and kataegis events 18,59. The rl20 metric appears robust to
most such distortions but we find it efficiently detects kataegis events that are in an otherwise

indicate the total genomic span of mutations in the rl20 subset of mutation runs: kataegis
events typically span a tiny (<5%) fraction of the whole genome.

Extended Data Fig.2 | The frequency of sister chromatid exchanges is correlated with the point
mutation burden. a, The relationship between single nucleotide substitution mutation load and
detected sister chromatid exchange events in C3H tumours. Tumours with low cellularity (pink) have
high mutation load and form a sub-group with few detected sister chromatid exchange events; these
are suspected to be polyclonal tumours. b, As for a but showing CAST derived tumours. c, Evaluation
of the relationship between mutation load and ability to detect sister chromatid exchange events.
Mutations from C3H tumour 94315_N8 (shown in Fig. 2) randomly down-sampled and segmentation
analysis applied. Y-axis shows the percentage of sister chromatid exchange events detected (100
replicates, 95% C.I. pink). X-axis is on a log-scale: 95% of C3H and >95% of CAST tumours have
mutation counts to the right of the blue vertical line. Down-sampling other tumours gave comparable
results. d, The same down-sampling data as shown in panel c but the y-axis shows the percent of
mutations with the correct (same as full data) mutational asymmetry assignment.

Extended Data Fig.3 | Localising candidate reference genome assembly errors. Genome
coordinates shown on the x-axis. Separate plots are shown for the C3H (a) and CAST (b) strains.
Immediate switches between Watson and Crick mutational strand asymmetry are not expected on
autosomes unless both copies of the chromosome have a sister chromatid exchange event at
equivalent sites. However, inversions and inter-chromosomal translocations between the sequenced
genomes and the reference assembly are expected to produce immediate asymmetry switches.
Recurrent evidence of such a site indicates a systematic discrepancy between the sequence of the
reference genome and the actual genomic DNA sequence. The discordant segment coverage (DSC)
count (black y-axis) shows the number of informative tumours (those with either Watson or Crick
strand asymmetry at the corresponding genome position) that suggest a tumour genome to reference
genome discrepancy at the indicated genomic position. The consensus support (brown y-axis) plotted
as triangles shows the percentage of informative tumours that support a genomic discrepancy at the
indicated position (only shown for values >50% support). The two sites on chromosome 6 in C3H
correspond to a previously identified C3H strain specific inversion that is known to be incorrectly
oriented in the C3H reference assembly60. Similarly we detect four candidate mis-assemblies in the
CAST reference genome, though these could represent mouse colony specific chromosomal
rearrangements. The candidate mis-assembly on C3H chromosome 14 is at an approximately
orthologous position to the chromosome 14 site in CAST suggesting that this may represent a
rearrangement shared between strains or a missassembly in the BL6 GRCm38 reference assembly
against which other mouse reference genome assemblies have been scaffolded.

Extended Data Fig.4 | Locally elevated mutational diversity is driven by sister-chromatid
exchange. a, Double strand breaks (DSBs) and other DNA damage can trigger homologous
recombination (HR) mediated DNA repair between sister chromatids. The repair intermediate resolves
into separate chromatids through cleavage and ligation; grey triangles denote cleavage sites for one of
the possible resolutions that would result in a large-scale sister-chromatid exchange event. b,
Enrichment analysis of sister chromatid exchanges sites (red) compared with null expectations from
randomly permuting locations into the analysable fraction of the genome (grey distributions), the black
boxes denote 95% of 1,000 permutations. Sister chromatid exchange events are enriched in later
replicating and transcriptionally less active genomic regions (Hi-C defined compartment B), and
correspondingly depleted from early replicating active regions. c, Aggregating across n=9,645 sister
chromatid exchange sites, the observed mutation rate approximately doubles at the inferred site of
exchange (x=0). Aggregate mutation rates (brown) were calculated in consecutive 5kb windows.
Compositionally matched null expectation was generated by permuting each exchange site into 100
proxy tumours and calculating median (black) and 95% confidence intervals (grey) while preserving
the total number of projected sites per proxy tumour. d, The elevated mutation count is not the result
of a high mutation density in a subset of exchange sites, rather it is a subtle increase in mutations

across most exchange sites. Heatmap showing mutation counts calculated in consecutive 5kb
windows across each exchange site. Rows represent each exchange site, rank-ordered by total
mutation count across each 400kb interval. e, The distribution of positional uncertainty in exchange
site location approximately mirrors the decay profile of elevated mutation frequency. f, Divergence of
mutation rate spectra is shown as cosine distance between the analysed window and the genome
wide mutation rate spectrum aggregated over all C3H tumours. Despite the elevated mutation
frequency, there is no detected distortion of the mutation spectrum. g, A model based on HR repair
intermediate, branch migration that produces heteroduplex segments of (i) mismatch:mismatch
(circles) and (ii) lesion:lesion (red triangles) strands. Subsequent strand segregation would increase
the mutational diversity of a descendant cell population but not the mutation count per cell (key as per
Fig. 2).

Recurrently mutated sites in both C3H and CAST with sufficient estimated power to detect oncogenic
selection through biased strand retention analysis (required >33 C3H recurrences or >41 CAST
recurrences). Odds ratio values >1 indicate the predicted correlation of driver mutation and
Watson/Crick strand retention in tumours with the candidate driver mutation, but not for those without
the mutation. The Fisher’s exact test P-value is shown after Bonferroni correction. Known driver
indicates the mutation or its orthologous change has previously been implicated as a driver of
hepatocellular carcinoma10. The CAST 6:37451282_A/T mutation is orthologous to the C3H
6:37548568_A/T mutation.

Extended Data Fig.5 | Replication of transcription coupled repair with lesion strand resolution
in Mus castaneus. a, Transcription coupled repair of template strand lesions is dependent on
transcription level (P15 liver, transcripts per million (TPM)). Confidence intervals (99%) are shown as
whiskers, where broad enough to be visible. b, Comparison of mutation rates for the 64 trinucleotide
contexts: each context has one point for low and one point for high expression. c, Data as in panel b
plotted on log scale; there is a line linking low and high expression for the same trinucleotide context.
d, Sequence composition normalised profiles of mutation rate around transcription start sites (TSS). e,
Stratifying the data plotted in d by lesion strand reveals much greater detail on the observed mutation
patterns, including the pronounced influence of bidirectional transcription initiation.

Extended Data Fig.6 | Additional examples of mutation patterns generated by lesion
segregation from a diverse range of clinically relevant mutagens. a, Despite the low total
mutation load (1,308 nucleotide substitutions, 842 informative T→A changes), the mutational
asymmetry of lesion segregation (plotted as per Fig. 2a-c) is evident for aristolochic acid exposed
clone MSM0.3_s25. b,c, Equivalent asymmetry plots for other mutagenised, human induced
pluripotent stem cells. d, Summary mutation asymmetry ribbons (as per Fig. 2d) for all mutagen
exposed clones with rl20 >5, which illustrates the independence of asymmetry pattern between
replicate clones, almost universal asymmetry on chromosome X, and approximately 50% of the
autosomal genome with asymmetry over autosomal chromosomes. The dominant mutation type is
indicated for each mutagen. In those clones with low mutation rates, some sister exchange sites are
likely to have been missed leading to reduced asymmetry signal (e.g. on the X chromosome,
Extended Data Fig. 2c).
