Abstract: Quantitative assessment of changes in macro-autophagy is often performed through
manual quantification of the number of LC3B foci in immunofluorescence microscopy images.
This method is highly laborious, subject to image-field selection and foci-counting bias, and is
not sensitive for analyzing changes in basal autophagy. Alternative methods such as flow
cytometry and transmission electron microscopy require highly specialized, expensive
instruments and time-consuming sample preparation. Immunoblots are prone to exposure-related
variations and noise that prevent accurate quantification. We report a high-throughput,
inexpensive, reliable, and objective method for studying basal level and flux changes in latestage autophagy using image cytometry and acridine orange staining.

Macro-autophagy (referred to as autophagy hereafter) is a cellular recycling mechanism
used for maintaining cytoplasmic homeostasis and surviving a variety of cellular stresses (1, 2).
The most common inducer of autophagy is nutrient deprivation, although pharmacologic
activation using the mTOR inhibitor, PP242, also induces autophagy (3) (Figure 1).

Increases in autophagosomes can be caused by either autophagy induction or inhibition of
downstream processing such as lysosomal fusion (2, 9) (Figure 1). Therefore, it is important to
analyze late stage autophagy, such as changes in autolysosome levels, to directly study
autophagic induction. Acridine orange (AO) is a fluorophore that accumulates in a protonatedform inside acidic vesicular organelles (AVO) such as autolysosomes. At high concentrations,
AO dimerizes causing a metachromatic shift from green to red (Figure 1), which can be
measured for studying late-stage autophagy. Thomé et al. can be referenced for detailed
chemical and concentration changes (10). AO can be assessed using fluorescence microscopy
or flow cytometry, but these approaches suffer from the limitations described above (Table 1).
We have used image cytometry as a quantitative, high-throughput, objective, and inexpensive
method (referred to as ‘AO assay’ from hereafter) that can be used to measure changes in basal
autophagy and autophagic flux using acridine orange. The AO assay is a useful screening tool
and reliable, unbiased complement to the more qualitative and expensive approaches
described above for studying autophagy.

The first step in autophagy induction involves the formation of a double membraned
autophagosome that engulfs cellular materials and subsequently fuses with the lysosome to form
an autolysosome, where cellular materials are degraded (4). Protein light-chain 3B-II (LC3B-II)
is a key marker found on autophagosome membranes and its levels are studied using
immunofluorescence (IF), immunoblot, flow cytometry, and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) to understand changes in autophagy (2). LC3B-II is degraded upon autolysosome
formation, and thus inhibitors of autolysosome formation such as Bafilomycin A1 are used to
accumulate LC3-IIB for a standard amount of time to study autophagic flux (2, 5). However, the
quantification of immunofluorescence is subject to imaging field-selection bias, counting bias,
and observer variations even when using semi-automated quantification methods (6).
Immunoblot quantification is subject to incorrect results from minor loading errors and from
over-saturation of house-keeping or target proteins in an attempt to distinguish differences in the
protein of interest (7). TEM requires specialized equipment and specific expertise for
interpreting data and thus can be prone to misinterpretation (8). Flow cytometry requires
specialized equipment and time-consuming sample preparation and is better suited for discerning
the proportion of a sample that is undergoing autophagy. These methods are summarized and
compared in Table 1.

UM-SCC47 cells were cultured in black-wall, clear-bottom 96-well plates (the outer
wells were left empty as they were prone to noise/ incorrect read-outs) and on 8-well IF slides. IF
was used as a qualitative, established comparison for the AO assay. Cells were treated with
DMSO, PP242 (500nM or 2μM) both with and without Bafilomycin A1 (Baf, 100nM) for 24

hours. For IF, 24 hours post-treatment, slides were fixed and tagged with LC3B (D11) XP Rabbit
mAb (Cell Signaling Technology #3868), fluorescently conjugated (Alexa Fluor 488), stained
with DAPI (Invitrogen Fluoromount-G with DAPI), and 3 random fields imaged using a 40x
objective (Olympus BX41 inverted microscope with XM10 camera). The area of LC3B foci was
quantified using FIJI and normalized to cell count (11). A 2-way ANOVA multi-variance test
(alpha .05) was performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). Both
basal autophagy (Baf-) and autophagic flux (Baf+ minus Baf-) was assessed (Figure 2A/B). A
different IF slide was washed with 1X phosphate buffered saline at pH 7.4 (1xPBS) and stained
with 1μg/ml acridine orange solution diluted in 1xPBS. The slide was cover-slipped and
immediately imaged as described above using a 20x objective (Figure 2C/D).

For the image-cytometer based AO Assay, 24 hours post-treatment, 96-well plates were
washed three times (100μL/well) with 1xPBS. 50μL of 1μg/ml AO was added to each well and
the plates were incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. Cells were then washed two times
(100μL/well) with 1X PBS. 50μL of 1X PBS was added per well, and then the plates were read
on the SpectraMax i3 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader Platform with MiniMax 300 Imaging
Cytometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) using the SoftMax Pro software (v6.4).

The monochromator and MiniMax settings were used on the software (Supplemental
Figure 1). The monochromator setting was used to measure excitation/emission wavelengths of
500/526 (green) to assess intensity of unprotonated, diffuse AO staining DNA (nonautophagic staining), and 460/650 (red) to assess intensity of dimerized, protonated AO
concentrated in AVOs (autophagic staining) (10). The MiniMax setting was used to count the
number of cells per well as we have previously described (12). The red intensity signal per well
was divided by the green intensity or the cell count to assess the level of autophagy and to assess
the efficacy of the two normalization methods: controlling to green intensity as recommended by
Thome et al. vs. controlling to cell count as previously done by Fowler et al. (10, 12). The
statistical analysis performed on the IF data was performed on the AO assay recorded values.
Basal level autophagy and autophagic flux (Baf- minus Baf+) was graphed along with a 95%
confidence interval.

As shown in Figure 2A/B, imaging LC3B demonstrates a dose-dependent increase in
autophagic flux but does not demonstrate a dose response in basal autophagy. However, the
quantified results should be viewed with caution as slight changes in the threshold used for
quantification can drastically change the results (Supplemental Figure 2). We recommend using
the IF images as a qualitative comparison. The graph in Figure 2B shows a significant increase in
autophagic flux, but not basal level autophagy, following 2μM PP242 treatment. The higher fold
change in basal autophagy after 500nM PP242 treatment compared to 2μM treatment as well as
the low LC3B foci areas reflect the insensitivity of the assay to analyzing basal level changes.

Fluorescent images of AO stained cells show a dose-dependent increase in basal
autophagy (Figure 2C, top row) as illustrated by increased red intensity and decreased green
intensity. In the Baf- group, the increase in red cytoplasmic intensity in conjunction with a
decrease in green nuclear intensity with increasing doses of PP242 reflects a PP242 dosedependent increase in basal autophagy (10). In the Baf+ group, no significant differences are
observed between groups since Baf inhibits late stage autophagy (i.e. accumulation of AVOs).
Regardless, the Baf can be used for quantitatively studying autophagic flux (red/green ratio of
Baf+ subtracted from Baf-, Figure 2D). The graph shows basal autophagy and autophagic flux
measured by the image cytometer using AO (plating density: 5000 cells per well). An increase in
both flux change and basal autophagy is seen following 2μM PP242 treatment, but not after
500nM PP242 treatment. This data is consistent with the images in Figure 2C where a decrease
in green but only a slight increase in red staining is seen after 500nM treatment. However, in the
2μM group, a clear shift from green to red is observed. The same trend is seen in Figure 2A and
2B as well, with a clear increase in LC3B puncta following 2μM PP242 treatment, but not much
change after 500nM treatment (Baf+ group). A correlation of autophagic flux between LC3B
and AO shows an R2 value of .9508 (Supplemental Figure 3) thereby confirming the
sensitivity and accuracy of the AO assay. The efficacy of this assay was also confirmed
using other cancer cell lines and other autophagy inducers/inhibitors (Data not shown).

To assess the effect of cell plating density and compare different normalization methods,
we repeated the experiment using a range of plated cell densities (Figure 2E). At low densities,
inconsistent results are seen (1,000 and 2,000 cells/well) while better consistency in this cell line
is seen at plating densities between 3,000-6,000 cells/well. Similar results were seen independent
of the normalization method used: green nuclear intensity vs. cell count. Due to the significantly
faster analysis using green intensity, this is our preferred approach. We also compared results
across different plates and saw no consistent differences (Figure 2F).

This data demonstrates the value of image cytometry of AO to assess changes in basal
autophagy and autophagic flux. The inexpensive nature of this assay, its ability to be used in
high-throughput screens, and the objective nature of the data analysis make this assay a useful
tool and complement to more qualitative approaches to studying autophagy.
