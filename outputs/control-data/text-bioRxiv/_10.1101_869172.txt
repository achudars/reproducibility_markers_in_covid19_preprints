Abstract
Argonaute proteins use nucleic acid guides to protect organisms against transposons
and viruses. In the eubacterium Thermus thermophilus, the DNA-guided Argonaute
TtAgo defends against transformation by DNA plasmids. Here, we report that TtAgo
also participates in DNA replication. TtAgo binds small DNA guides derived from the
chromosomal region where replication terminates and associates with proteins known to
act in DNA replication. T. thermophilus deploys a single type II topoisomerase, gyrase.
When gyrase is inhibited, T. thermophilus relies on TtAgo to complete replication of its
circular genome; loss of both gyrase and TtAgo activity produces long filaments that fail
to separate into individual bacteria. We propose that the primary role of TtAgo is to help
T. thermophilus disentangle the catenated circular chromosomes made by DNA
replication.

Main text
In all domains of life, short nucleic acid guides direct Argonaute (AGO) proteins to
defend against transposons, viruses, or plasmids. Among sequenced eubacterial
genomes, ~17% encode AGO proteins, whose in vivo functions remain poorly
understood (1–3). Prokaryotic AGOs often reside in genomic neighborhoods populated
by genes acting in host defense (4). Unlike eukaryotic Argonautes which bind RNA
guides, some prokaryotic AGOs use DNA guides to target DNA cleavage. Such DNAguided, DNA endonucleases include TtAgo (TT_P0026) from Thermus thermophilus, a
Gram-negative eubacterium that thrives at 65°C, (5–7). In vivo, TtAgo reduces
susceptibility to transformation by DNA plasmids (5), and, when produced in E. coli,
randomly acquires guide DNAs from plasmids and the genome. T. thermophilus
encodes its genes on both a large circular chromosome (~1.9 Mb) and one (HB27
strain) or more (HB8 strain) megaplasmids as large as 0.27 Mb (8–10). Each cell
contains 4–7 copies of the chromosome and megaplasmid, which segregate randomly
between daughter cells (11, 12). In both HB27 and HB8, TtAgo resides on the
megaplasmid with other host defense genes.
In eukaryotes, RNA-guided human and plant AGOs can acquire RNA guides
from double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) breaks and act in DNA repair, and human AGO2
associates with Rad51 (13–15). In Drosophila S2 cells, Ago2 can similarly acquire RNA
guides from dsDNA breaks (16, 17). That some prokaryotic AGOs bind small DNAs
(smDNA) suggests potential roles in replication, repair or recombination. In prokaryotes,
smDNA guides may be readily available, at least in E. coli, because the repair and
recombination complex RecBCD generates smDNAs that integrate as spacers into
CRISPR loci via replication-dependent mechanism (18). We sought to understand the
role of TtAgo in vivo in T. thermophilus.

TtAgo binds smDNA guides from the terminus of replication
In vivo, TtAgo binds 15–18 nt long DNA guides that derive mainly from a 39 kb region
on the T. thermophilus chromosome, directly opposite the origin of replication (Fig. 1).
We used a polyclonal antibody raised against the entire TtAgo protein to
immunoprecipitate the nucleic acids associated with TtAgo in wild-type or mutant T.
thermophilus HB27 strains grown at 65°C (Fig. 1, A to C and fig. S1A and B). Long
(>1000 nt) and short (15–18 nt), 5′ monophosphorylated nucleic acids coimmunoprecipitate with wild-type TtAgo (Fig. 1D). Sensitivity to DNase and resistance to
RNase identified the nucleic acids associated with TtAgo as DNA. High-throughput
sequencing of the long DNAs showed that they mapped essentially to the entire
chromosome and megaplasmid (fig. S1C). In contrast, within both the chromosome and
megaplasmid, the smDNAs mainly derived from a region 183° clockwise from the
annotated origin of replication (ori) (Fig. 1E). Among the 15–18 nt sequences mapping
just once to the genome (96% of reads), 90% aligned to the chromosome and 10% to
the megaplasmid, a distribution comparable to the relative sizes of the two genomic
components (88% and 12% of the genome, respectively), indicating that neither is
preferentially sampled. As observed for TtAgo expressed in E. coli (5), the smDNAs coimmunoprecipitated with TtAgo in vivo typically began with cytidine, but otherwise had a
GC content identical to the T. thermophilus genome (fig. S1, D and E)
That TtAgo binds smDNAs from a ~39 kbp region directly opposite the origin of
replication suggests these ssDNA guides arise from a region encompassing the
terminus (ter), where replication of the circular chromosome and megaplasmid finishes,
producing catenated daughter chromosomes that must be separated by topoisomerase
II enzymes. Because the terminus has not yet been defined for T. thermophilus, we first
used GC skew analysis, a method that identifies the origin and terminus of replication
based on the distinct nucleotide content of the leading and lagging DNA strands (skew

calculated as [G-C]/[G+C]) (19). Cumulative GC skew analysis placed the ori of the
strain HB27 chromosome at 1,541,431 bp, < 2 kbp from the site (1,540,040 bp for our
lab strain by long-read sequencing and de novo assembly) deduced from the location of
the gene encoding the replication initiating factor dnaA, which typically initiates
replication by binding a site immediately after its own coding sequence (20) (Fig. 1E).
Cumulative GC skew analysis located the chromosomal terminus site 187° opposite the
ori at 626,088 bp, within the region to which the co-immunoprecipitated smDNAs align
(Fig. 1E). This method also identified the terminus of the megaplasmid at 187° opposite
its ori and within the 25 kbp region generating abundant TtAgo-bound smDNAs.
Cumulative GC skew analysis of the T. thermophilus HB8 strain similarly showed that
the 15–18 nt DNA guides associated with TtAgo mapped opposite the origin of
replication (fig. S1F).
Second, we used high-throughput, short-read DNA sequencing to identify ori and
ter. In logarithmically growing bacteria, DNA replication typically initiates more often
than it concludes. Consequently, chromosomal sequences from ori are overrepresented, while those from ter are under-represented in logarithmically growing cells
relative to those that have reached stationary phase (21, 22). The ratio of logarithmic to
stationary phase genomic sequencing coverage placed ter 183° clockwise from ori at
597,500 bp, again within the region producing abundant smDNAs bound to TtAgo (fig.
S1G).
Catalytically inactive TtAgo fails to accumulate high levels of smDNA guides
Guide acquisition by TtAgo is poorly understood. Purified TtAgo has been reported to
cleave dsDNA without sequence specificity, suggesting that TtAgo itself initiates guide
production (23). Supporting this idea, smDNAs do not co-purify with catalytically inactive
TtAgoD478A,D546A (henceforth double point-mutant, TtAgoDM) when over-expressed in E.
coli grown at 37°C (5). We produced both mutant and wild-type TtAgo in E. coli and

purified each protein to apparent homogeneity. In agreement with earlier studies, we did
not detect either smDNA-directed or sequence-independent cleavage of single-stranded
target DNA during a 16 h incubation at 65°C, even when purified TtAgoDM, loaded with a
smDNA guide, was present 45,000-fold above its KD, a 50-fold excess over the singlestranded DNA (ssDNA) target fully complementary to the DNA guide (fig. S2A). Under
these same conditions, purified wild-type TtAgo, guided by the same smDNA, cleaved
the ssDNA target within 1 h; ssDNA cleavage required the smDNA guide. However, we
failed to detect any cleavage of dsDNA by wild-type, purified recombinant TtAgo, either
in the presence or absence of a smDNA guide (fig. S2B), and TtAgo bound dsDNA 40fold more weakly than ssDNA guides (fig. S2D). Our data suggest that TtAgo is a DNAguided, single-stranded DNA endonuclease devoid of detectable sequence-independent
double-stranded DNase activity.
Further evidence against a role of TtAgo in the initial generation of its own
smDNA guides comes from analysis of the nucleic acids associated with TtAgoDM
immunoprecipitated from T. thermophilus grown at 65°C. As reported previously for
TtAgoDM expressed in E. coli, (5), in vivo, TtAgoDM bound 25–35 nt RNA (Fig. 2A), and
these small RNAs mapped throughout the genome. Unlike in E. coli, TtAgoDM in vivo
also bound smDNA guides that had the same length distribution as those associated
with wild-type TtAgo, typically began with cytidine, and mapped to a region
encompassing the chromosomal terminus (Fig. 2, B and C, and fig. S1D). Notably, 86%
of the uniquely mapping smDNA sequences co-immunoprecipitated with TtAgoDM also
co-purified with TtAgo (Fig. 2D). However, the guides associated in vivo with the
catalytically inactive protein were ~20 -fold less plentiful than for wild-type TtAgo, even
though in vivo, wild-type and mutant TtAgo proteins accumulated to equivalent levels
and were immunoprecipitated with the same efficiency; recombinant TtAgo and TtAgoDM
were both equally active and bound smDNA guides with similar affinities (Fig. 2E and

fig. S2, C and D). We conclude that the TtAgo DNA endonuclease acts in smDNA
loading or amplification, but not in their initial production.
TtAgo and gyrase collaborate to terminate DNA replication
The observation that TtAgo binds smDNA guides from the chromosomal and
megaplasmid termini suggests that in vivo the protein participates in DNA replication or
genome maintenance. To explore this idea, we screened wild-type (ago) and null
mutant (Δago) HB27 strains for their susceptibility to a panel of replication inhibitors and
DNA damaging agents. We observed no difference in growth between ago and Δago
grown in the presence of the DNA damaging agents 4-Nitroquinoline 1-oxide or methyl
methanesulfonate; the DNA crosslinking agents cisplatin or mitomycin C; the
ribonuclease reductase inhibitor hydroxyurea; or the gyrase subunit B inhibitor
novobiocin. However, the Δago strain was more sensitive to the gyrase subunit A
inhibitor ciprofloxacin than wild-type ago (Fig. 3A and fig. S3A). Increasing
concentrations of ciprofloxacin slowed the growth of Δago, but they did not decrease the
viability of the mutant strain, compared with ago (fig. S3, B and C). Under these
conditions, the abundance of wild-type TtAgo-associated smDNA guides mapping to the
terminus increased (fig. S4, A to C).
The mechanism by which the agents inhibit replication gives insight into the role
of TtAgo in vivo. Hydroxyurea inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, depleting available
dNTPs. The lack of differential susceptibility between ago and Δago suggests
replication elongation does not rely upon TtAgo. The increased sensitivity of Δago to
ciprofloxacin, which inhibits gyrase A, but not to novobiocin, which interferes with the B
subunit of the gyrase heterodimer, further restricts the possible roles for TtAgo in DNA
replication. Gyrase A cleaves both strands of dsDNA, forming a covalent DNA-enzyme
bond. Gyrase B uses ATP energy to induce negative supercoiling (24). The negative
twist generated by gyrase B is captured by re-ligation of the ends of the dsDNA by

gyrase A. Gyrase can also use the same mechanism to unlink catenated dsDNA circles
(25, 26). In E. coli, a second topoisomerase II enzyme, topo IV, decatenates the circular
chromosomes generated by DNA replication. T. thermophilus lacks topo IV. Thus, the
ability of gyrase A to break and rejoin dsDNA is predicted to decatenate replicated DNA
in T. thermophilus. When gyrase A is inhibited by ciprofloxacin, T. thermophilus should
therefore be unable to separate the catenated DNA circles generated by replication.
Failure to decatenate daughter chromosomes is predicted to impair nucleoid
segregation and prevent complete septation, causing individual cells to remain
connected and form long filaments. Contrary to this expectation, wild-type ago grew
essentially normally, showing only a modest increase in median cell length in the
presence of ciprofloxacin (Fig. 3, B and C). How then does T. thermophilus complete
replication without gyrase A function?
Successful nucleoid segregation and complete septation when gyrase A activity
is inhibited requires TtAgo: both the Δago and agoDM strains formed long filaments
when gyrase A was inhibited by ciprofloxacin (Fig. 3B). When the media contained
ciprofloxacin, both Dago and agoDM cells were significantly longer than wild-type, TtAgoexpressing cells (p = 3.8 × 10−11 for both; Tukey test). Moreover, in the presence of
ciprofloxacin, Dago cells were significantly longer than agoDM (p = 4.6 × 10−11; Tukey
test), consistent with the small amount of DNA guides present in the catalytically
inactive TtAgoDM strain (Fig. 3C). We conclude that TtAgo, loaded with smDNA guides
corresponding to the terminus, can facilitate completion of replication in T. thermophilus.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and stimulated emission depletion
(STED) microscopy images of wild-type and mutant T. thermophilus strains grown in
ciprofloxacin underscore the requirement for TtAgo in nucleoid segregation and
complete septation. By TEM, the daughter nucleoids of wild-type ago cells were set
back from the cell wall (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the daughter nucleoids of Dago and agoDM
cells lay close to the septal junctions within long filaments of incompletely separated

cells. Longitudinal cross-sections of Dago and agoDM filaments showed that the
nucleoids of adjacent segments were joined by a thin fiber that extended from cell to cell
along the length of the filament. To determine whether this fiber corresponds to DNA,
we stained the cells with PicoGreen, a dye whose fluorescent emission increases
~2,000-fold when bound to dsDNA (27), and examined them using STED microscopy
(Fig. 4B). In the presence of ciprofloxacin, the thin fiber extending between cells stained
brightly with PicoGreen in both Dago and agoDM, consistent with the cells being linked
by dsDNA. No PicoGreen-staining material was observed between wild-type ago cells.
We conclude that in the absence of both gyrase A and TtAgo function, newly replicated
T. thermophilus chromosomal DNA cannot be decatenated, blocking completion of
septation.
TtAgo binding partners implicate recombination in the completion of DNA
replication
The identity of proteins associated with TtAgo suggests that the protein collaborates
with recombination factors both to generate DNA guides and to separate catenated
chromosomes (Fig. 5 and fig. S5A). The T. thermophilus genome encodes an
AddA/AddB helicase-nuclease complex, which, like RecBCD, initiates repair of doublestrand breaks by homologous recombination and is required for completion of
replication (28–30). Mass spectrometry analysis of the proteins that specifically coimmunoprecipitated with TtAgo identified both AddA and AddB, as well as the
recombination factors Rad52 and ArgR (XerA), the ssDNA-binding protein SSB, and the
histone-like protein HU, consistent with TtAgo acting at DNA. (TtAgo appears to bind
sites of persistent ssDNA generally: RepA, which initiates DNA copying at oriC, also copurified with TtAgo, and TtAgo bound smDNAs mapping to the origin of replication [Fig.
1E]). Supporting the idea that TtAgo acquires its guides from the stalled replication forks
that accumulate at the end of replication of circular chromosomes, TtAgo co-purified

with PriA, which helps re-start stalled replication forks; RecJ, an exonuclease that
repairs stalled forks; TopoI, which relieves negative supercoiling behind replication
forks; and PolA, which replaces the RNA primers on the lagging strand of the fork with
DNA. Proteins acting at the end of replication (GyrA and GyrB), in DNA repair (UvrB),
and in cytokinesis (FtsE), also co-immunoprecipitated with TtAgo. Many of these TtAgo
interacting proteins likely bind via protein-protein interactions, because (1) their
association persisted when the lysate was incubated with DNase before
immunoprecipitation (Fig. 5 and fig. S5B), and (2) many of the proteins associated with
wild-type TtAgo also associated with catalytically inactive TtAgoDM, despite the mutant
protein binding >20-fold fewer smDNA guides (Fig. 5). Notably, the recombination
proteins AddA and AddB, which co-purified with wild-type TtAgo even after DNase
treatment, were not significantly associated with TtAgoDM, perhaps because they bind
only TtAgo loaded with a smDNA guide. Figure S5C provides a complete list of proteins
specifically co-immunoprecipitating with TtAgo.
Discussion
Argonaute proteins defend against viral infection, silence transposons, inhibit
transformation by plasmids, direct transcriptional silencing, promote mRNA decay, and
repress translation. Our data expand the list of Argonaute functions to include ensuring
successful replication of circular chromosomes: in vivo, TtAgo, binds ~16 nt DNA guides
derived from the terminus of replication and facilitates decatenation, enabling
subsequent nucleoid segregation and cytokinesis. In the laboratory, we can detect the
function of TtAgo in chromosomal replication only when GyrA is inhibited; future
experiments will be needed to determine whether TtAgo confers a long-term selective
advantage to T. thermophilus under more natural conditions.
How does TtAgo, a DNA-guided, DNA-binding, DNA endonuclease facilitate
chromosome decatenation? Under normal physiological conditions, the gyrase

heterodimers first cut both DNA strands of one newly replicated chromosome in the
terminus, forming a covalent DNA-enzyme complex with one strand of each of the two
resulting gate-segments (G-segments) (24, 31) (Fig. 6A). The other daughter
chromosome, the transfer-segment, is passed through this break, decatenating the two
circles. Finally, the G-segments covalently linked to Gyrase A are ligated to each other,
regenerating a circular chromosome and allowing the two chromosome copies to
partition between daughter cells. In the presence of ciprofloxacin, the G-segments are
trapped as DNA-enzyme intermediates, blocking decatenation and eliciting
filamentation. We propose that TtAgo-guide complex can bypass this block by binding
complementary ssDNA sequences in the terminus (32). Once bound, TtAgo resolves
catenanes either (1) by slicing the ssDNA to generate a double-strand break which can
then be resected by TtAgo-associated AddAB, triggering recombination or (2) by simply
bringing recombination factors, such as Rad52, ArgR, or AddAB, to the terminus. We
favor the second model, because the severity of filamentation in the catalytically inactive
agoDM strain was significantly less than in Δago. Our data suggest that smDNA guides
derived from the terminus direct TtAgo to the terminus, and that TtAgo associated
proteins, rather than endonucleolytic cleavage of DNA, drive decatenation itself.
Published observations provide additional support for this model: (1) expression of the
TtAgo MID-PIWI domain in E. coli enhances sequence-directed recombination (33), and
(2) in E. coli, a region identical in size and location to the T. thermophilus smDNA locus
is a site of hyperrecombination (34, 35).
How does TtAgo acquire guides from the terminus region? As replication forks
approach the terminus, forks stall, often causing nicks and dsDNA breaks (36, 37) (Fig.
6B). We can imagine two mechanisms by which TtAgo can exploit DNA breaks to obtain
guides. First, TtAgo may bind the free 5′ monophosphate at nicks in dsDNA, perhaps at
nicks beginning with a 5′ cytidine, reflecting the protein’s preference for targets bearing
a guanosine across from the first guide nucleotide (23, 38). Although TtAgo prefers to

bind ssDNA, the protein’s in vivo concentration (>200 nM) far exceeds its in vitro KD (30
nM) for binding 5′ monophosphorylated dsDNA. Next, TtAgo would cleave the target
strand, providing an entry point for its associated AddAB complex to degrade both the
target DNA strand and trim the 3′ end of the guide strand, liberating a ~16 nt ssDNA
guide bound to TtAgo. Alternatively, AddAB may generate free smDNAs that its
associated TtAgo can then bind. The finding that TtAgoDM is largely devoid of guides
favors the first model, but a detailed dissection of guide acquisition may require
development of a cell-free T. thermophilus lysate that recapitulates the process.
Do Argonaute proteins decatenate chromosomes or otherwise participate in DNA
replication, recombination, or repair in other prokaryotes? Although Argonaute proteins
can be found across prokaryotes, only some are predicted to retain cleavage activity
(1). Our data suggest that species harboring active Argonaute proteins comprise the
most promising candidates for exploration. A broad survey of these strains may require
the development of a metagenomics approach to identifying Argonaute guides in
complex mixtures of bacteria. Given the growing problem of bacterial resistance to
antibiotics, identifying Argonaute functions in prokaryotes could provide a starting point
for developing drugs that block DNA replication or cytokinesis in combination with
existing antibiotics.

Methods summary
Detailed materials and methods can be found in the supplementary materials. Briefly,
we prepared marked wild-type and mutant strains by homologous recombination using
vectors containing a thermostable kanamycin resistance gene for selection, and the
genomes verified by long-read sequencing. Small DNA guides bound to TtAgo were
prepared for sequencing using a splint ligation technique (39) and visualized using
Circos software. Proteins co-immunoprecipitating with TtAgo were identified by LCMS/MS. Spot plating assays were performed by plating serial dilutions of logarithmic
phase T. thermophilus on gellan-gum fortified agar containing the inhibitor of interest.
Gross external morphology was imaged by SEM. Lengths of filaments were determined
from DIC microscopy images of fixed cells. The nucleoid was characterized by TEM and
STED microscopy.

Fig. 1. TtAgo expression and TtAgo-bound nucleic acids. (A) Study strains: wildtype T. thermophilus strain HB27; ago, wild-type bearing a thermostable kanamycin
resistance gene (htk) at the endogenous ago locus; agoDM, D478A, D546A mutant
expressing catalytically inactive TtAgo; Δago, a deletion mutant lacking the ago gene.
(B) Detection of TtAgo expression at OD600 = 0.5. rTtAgo: purified, recombinant TtAgo.
(C) Immunoprecipitation of TtAgo from lysates of the bacteria in (B). (D) DNase and
RNase digestion of nucleic acids bound to TtAgo following dephosphorylation and
radiolabeling. (E) Alignment to the wild-type HB27 genome of TtAgo-bound small DNAs
sequenced using a method that requires a 5′ monophosphorylated end. Reads are
grouped in 100 bp bins. Inner grey circle: ratio of DNA content between logarithmic and
stationary phases. Inner green circle: cumulative GC-skew analysis. Bar graph
illustrates length distribution of genome-mapping 5′-phosphorylated DNA guides bound

microscopy analysis of strains grown in the presence or absence of 12.5 µM
ciprofloxacin. (C) Length distribution of T. thermophilus cells grown in the presence or
absence of 12.5 µM ciprofloxacin. Two-way ANOVA: ciprofloxacin and genotype effect
on length (F (2, 2277) = 77.743, p < 2 × 10−16); ciprofloxacin effect on length (F (1,
2277) = 612.90, p < 2 × 10−16); genotype effect on cell length (F (2, 2277) = 3.537, p =
0.03). Tukey test: ciprofloxacin treated cells were significantly longer than untreated
cells (7.1 µm, p = 3.8 x 10−11, 95% CI [6.5, 7.9]); treated Dago cells were longer than
ago (2.8 µm, p = 3.8 × 10−11, 95% CI [2.8-3.4]; treated agoDM cells were longer than ago
(1.7 µm, p = 3.8 × 10−11, 95% CI [1.5-2.0]); treated Dago cells were longer agoDM (1.6
µm, p = 4.6 × 10−11, 95% CI [1.3-1.9])
