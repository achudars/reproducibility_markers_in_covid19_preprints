Abstract

11

Current methods for monitoring marine fish diversity mostly rely on trawling surveys,

12

which are invasive, costly and time-consuming. Moreover, these methods are selective,

13

targeting a subset of species at the time, and can be inaccessible to certain areas. Here, we

14

explore the potential of environmental DNA (eDNA), the DNA present in the water column

15

as part of shed cells, tissues or mucus, to provide comprehensive information about fish

16

diversity in a large marine area. Further, eDNA results were compared to the fish diversity

17

obtained in pelagic trawls. A total of 44 5L-water samples were collected onboard a wide-

18

scale oceanographic survey covering about 120,000 square kilometres in Northeast Atlantic

19

Ocean. A short region of the 12S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced through

20

metabarcoding generating almost 3.5 million quality-filtered reads. Trawl and eDNA samples

21

resulted in the same most abundant species (European anchovy, European pilchard, Atlantic

22

mackerel and blue whiting), but eDNA metabarcoding resulted in more detected fish and

23

elasmobranch species (116) than trawling (16). Although an overall correlation between fish

24

biomass and number of reads was observed, some species deviated from the common trend,

25

which could be explained by inherent biases of each of the methods. Species distribution

26

patterns inferred from eDNA metabarcoding data coincided with current ecological

27

knowledge of the species, suggesting that eDNA has the potential to draw sound ecological

28

conclusions that can contribute to fish surveillance programs. Our results support eDNA

29

metabarcoding for broad scale marine fish diversity monitoring in the context of Directives

30

such as the Common Fisheries Policy or the Marine Strategy Framework Directive.

Introduction

34

Monitoring of marine biodiversity provides a baseline for policy implementation

35

towards a sustainable use of the marine environment and its resources. Among the traditional

36

methods for surveying marine fauna, trawling has been widely used, as identification and

37

quantification of large volumes of organisms is considered a reliable method for monitoring

38

fish and other marine animal populations (ICES, 2015; Massé, Uriarte, Angélico, & Carrera,

39

2018). Fish surveys using trawls are conditioned by the gear’s own characteristics (e.g., mesh

40

size, area of opening) and deployment parameters (e.g., towing speed, depth and diel

41

variation) (Heino et al., 2011). Consequently, besides being invasive and time consuming,

42

fish trawling in pelagic environments can be largely selective affecting diversity estimates and

43

knowledge of species composition (Fraser, Greenstreet, & Piet, 2007; ICES, 2004). For

44

instance, due to their large body size, fast swimming speed, and in some cases, scarcity, many

45

elasmobranch species are not thoroughly surveyed (Rago, 2004). Therefore, alternative

46

methods are needed, and advances in DNA sequencing and bioinformatics have opened new

47

avenues to assess marine biodiversity in a non-invasive manner (Danovaro et al., 2016; Rees,

48

Maddison, Middleditch, Patmore, & Gough, 2014).

49

In particular, the analysis of environmental DNA (eDNA), that is, the genetic material

50

shed and excreted by organisms to the environment, to characterise the biological

51

communities present in an environment (P. Taberlet, Coissac, Hajibabaei, & Rieseberg, 2012)

52

is gaining increasing attention for monitoring aquatic environments (Thomsen & Willerslev,

53

2015). Community composition can be inferred from eDNA samples through metabarcoding,

54

whereby the eDNA is collected from the water column through filtering, selectively amplified

55

through PCR using primers targeting a given barcode from a particular taxonomic group and

56

sequenced (Pierre Taberlet, Coissac, Pompanon, Brochmann, & Willerslev, 2012). The

57

resulting sequences are then compared against a reference database to perform biodiversity

58

inventories (Deiner et al., 2017). Most studies using eDNA metabarcoding for monitoring fish

59

communities are based in freshwater environments and have shown that eDNA

60

metabarcoding provides overall

61

methods such as visual surveys, trawling or electrofishing (Hänfling et al., 2016; Minamoto,

62

Yamanaka, Takahara, Honjo, & Kawabata, 2012; Pont et al., 2018).

estimates that are equivalent or superior to traditional

63

As opposed to freshwater systems, the marine environment has in general a larger

64

water-volume to fish biomass ratio and is influenced by currents, implying that the eDNA is

65

less concentrated and disperses quicker (Hansen, Bekkevold, Clausen, & Nielsen, 2018).

66

This, coupled with a higher sympatric marine fish diversity, suggests that monitoring fish

67

diversity through eDNA sampling could be particularly challenging in the marine

68

environment. Indeed, only a handful of studies have applied eDNA metabarcoding for

69

monitoring fish and elasmobranchs in natural marine environments (e.g., O’Donnell et al.,

70

2017; Stat et al., 2017). Among them, only a few have compared eDNA and other traditional

71

surveying methods and are based on a very small area of a few square kilometres either in

72

ports (Jeunen et al., 2019; Sigsgaard et al., 2017; Thomsen et al., 2012) or in coastal areas

73

(Andruszkiewicz et al., 2017; DiBattista et al., 2017; Yamamoto et al., 2017) or have

74

performed comparisons at family level taxonomic assignments (Thomsen et al., 2016). Thus,

75

although these studies envision eDNA metabarcoding as a promising method for non-

76

invasive, faster, more efficient and reliable marine surveys, this needs still to be tested in the

77

context of a fishery survey covering a broad marine area.

78

The Bay of Biscay is a biogeographical area in the North Atlantic Region covering

79

more than 220,000 Km2, at which the main economic activities include commercial fishing.

European pilchard Sardina pilchardus, the European hake Merluccius merluccius, the

82

Atlantic Mackerel Scomber scombrus and the Atlantic horse mackerel Trachurus trachurus

83

are dominant in the area (ICES, 2018). Fish diversity in the Bay of Biscay has been accounted

84

using mainly observational methods, fish trawling and acoustic surveys; thus, there is room

85

for incorporating and assessing the performance of eDNA-based surveys. This paper aims to

86

test the potential of eDNA metabarcoding to assess the fish community composition in a large

87

marine area, such as the Bay of Biscay. For that aim, we have compared eDNA

88

metabarcoding based estimates with those derived from fishing trawls catches and have

89

related eDNA metabarcoding based estimates with the known spatial distribution and

90

ecological patterns of the species in the area.

Methods

93

Sample collection

94

Fish catches and water samples were collected during the BIOMAN 2017 survey (Santos,

95

Ibaibarriaga, Louzao, Korta, & Uriarte, 2018) between the 5th and the 29th of May 2017

96

covering the area of about 120,000 km2 between the French continental shelf and the Spanish

97

shelf (Figure 1) on board the Emma Bardán and Ramón Margalef research vessels. Fish

98

catches were obtained on board the R/V Emma Bardán pelagic trawler. The trawl had an 8

99

mm mesh size cod end, and towing time and speed were 40 min and 4 knots, respectively. A

100

total of 44 stations were used for trawling. Although station depths varied between 26 and

101

3000 m, the maximum fishing depth was 156 m. Onboard, fish were morphologically

102

identified to species level or, when doubt, to the smallest taxonomic rank (e.g., family or

103

genus). Biomass estimates were standardised as Kg caught per taxa. Water samples were

104

collected on board the R/V Ramón Margalef research vessel using the continuous circuit

105

intake of the ship at 4.4 m depth in 44 additional stations (Figure 1). A total of 5 L sea water

106

per station was filtered through Sterivex 0.45 µm pore size enclosed filters (Millipore) with a

107

peristaltic pump and kept at -20 °C until further processing.

108
109

DNA extraction and amplicon library preparation

110

DNA extractions were performed using the DNeasy® blood and tissue kit (Qiagen)

111

following the modified protocol for DNA extraction from Sterivex filters without preservation

112

buffer by Spens et al. (2017). DNA concentration was measured with the Quant-iT dsDNA

113

HS assay kit using a Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, California, USA). DNA

114

from all 44 samples was amplified with the teleo_F/telo_R primer pair (hereafter ‘teleo’),

115

targeting a short region ( 60 bp) of the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene, combined with the

116

human blocking primer teleo_blk (Valentini et al., 2016). PCR amplifications were done in a

117

final volume of 20 µl including 10 µl of 2X Phusion Master Mix (ThermoScientific,

118

Massachusetss, USA), 0.4 µl of each amplification primer (final concentration of 0.2 µM), 4

119

µl of teleo_blk (final concentration of 2 µM), 3.2 µl of MilliQ water and 2 µl of 10 ng/µl

120

template DNA. Samples from 4 stations were also amplified i) using the same procedure but

121

without the blocking primer and ii) using the mlCOIintF/dgHCO2198 primer pair (hereafter

122

‘mlCOI’), targeting a short region ( 310 bp) of the COI gene (Meyer, 2003). The

123

thermocycling profile for PCR amplification included 3 min at 98 °C; 40 or 35 cycles (for

124

‘teleo’ and ‘mlCOI’, respectively) of 10 s at 98 °C, 30 s at 55 or 46 °C (for ‘teleo’ and

125

‘mlCOI’, respectively) and 45 s at 72 °C, and finally, 10 min at 72 °C. PCR products were

126

purified using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, California, USA) following

amplicons in the second PCR reaction following the ‘16S Metagenomic Sequence Library

130

California, USA). Multiplexed PCR products were purified using the AMPure XP beads,

131

quantified using Quant-iT dsDNA HS assay kit using a Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer (Life

132

Technologies, California, USA) and adjusted to 4 nM. 5 µl of each sample were pooled,

133

checked for size and concentration using the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies,

134

California, USA), sequenced using the 2 x 300 paired end protocol on the Illumina MiSeq

135

platform (Illumina, California, USA) and demultiplexed based on their barcode sequences.

137

Reference database

138

Two reference databases were created for the ‘teleo’ barcode. A first ‘global’ database

139

included all Chordata 12S rRNA and complete mitochondrial genome sequences available

140

from GenBank (accessed in February 2018). By performing an all-against-all BLAST

141

(Altschul, Gish, Miller, Myers, & Lipman, 1990), potential sources of contamination or

142

erroneous taxonomic assignments were removed such as human contaminations (e.g., non-

143

human labelled sequences that matched at 100% identity with the Homo sapiens 12S rRNA

144

sequence) or cross-contaminated sequences (e.g., sequences arising from the same study that,

145

even when belonging to different genus, were 100% identical). All sequences were trimmed

146

to the ‘teleo’ region. Taxonomy for the GenBank sequences was retrieved using E-utilties

147

(Sayers, 2008) and modified to match that of the World Register of Marine Species: WoRMS

148

(Horton et al., 2018), forcing for seven taxonomic levels, i.e., Phylum, Subphylum, Class,

149

Order, Family, Genus, Species. This ‘global’ reference database contains 10,284 ‘teleo’

region sequences. For the second database, only sequences from target species were retrieved

151

so that more exhaustive error checking was possible. The list of the 1,858 fish species

152

expected in the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean areas was compiled from FishBase

153

(http://www.fishbase.org) and their corresponding scientific names

154

obtained from NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). For the retrieved records, only those

155

covering the ‘teleo’ region were selected and aligned (Table S1). A phylogenetic tree was

156

built with RAxML (Stamatakis, 2014) using the GTR-CAT model and visualized with iTOl

157

(Letunic & Bork, 2016). The tree was visually inspected and the records corresponding to

158

misplaced species were removed from the database. This ‘local’ reference database contains

159

‘teleo’ region sequences of 612 species. For the ‘mlCOI’ barcode, the reference database

consisted in the COI sequences and their corresponding taxonomy obtained from the BOLD

173

chimeras, which were detected based on the UCHIME algorithm (Edgar, Haas, Clemente,

174

Quince, & Knight, 2011). Reads were clustered into OTUs using vsearch (Rognes, Flouri,

175

Nichols, Quince, & Mahé, 2016) at 97% similarity threshold and into SWARMs using Swarm

176

(Mahé, Rognes, Quince, de Vargas, & Dunthorn, 2014) with a d value of 1. In both cases, the

177

LULU post-clustering algorithm (Frøslev et al., 2017) was applied with a minimum threshold

178

of sequence similarity for considering any OTU/SWARM as an error of 97%. Taxonomic

179

assignment of unique reads and of representative sequences for each OTU or SWARM was

180

performed using the naïve Bayesian classifier method (Wang, Garrity, Tiedje, & Cole, 2007)

181

implemented in mothur using the 12S rRNA and COI databases described above. Reads with

182

the same taxonomic assignment were clustered into phylotypes.

184

Biodiversity analyses

185

Analyses were performed with the R packages Phyloseq (McMurdie and Holmes

186

2013) and Vegan (Oksanen et al., 2019). Sampling stations were classified into three

187

categories considering their depth and distance from the coast (see Map in Figure 1): shallow

188

stations where maximum station depth was <90 m, medium stations, when depth ranged

189

between 90 and 127 m and, deep stations where depth was >127 m. To assess differences in

190

fish diversity across sampling zones (i.e., according to shallow, medium and deep stations) we

191

calculated the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index for relative abundance of species with the

192

function ordinate using only phylotypes with more than 10 reads. These distances were then

193

ordinated using a non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) as implemented in Phyloseq

194

and differences between stations were tested with PERMANOVA (1,000 permutations) using

195

the function adonis within the R package Vegan previous testing for homogeneity of variance

196

using the function betadisper. A linear model was used on species with more than 1,000

197

reads, to test for the effect of the abundance of reads (previously standardised according to the

198

overall number of reads and stations per zone), and the distance from the coast. An overall

199

correlation between the log-transformed values of the number of reads obtained and the

200

biomass caught per species was explored with the Pearson correlation coefficient as

201

implemented in R package Stats. For an even geographic distribution between water and fish

202

sampling sites, a total of nine water sampling sites north La Rochelle were removed for the

203

correlation analysis. In addition, in order to compare eDNA and trawling based estimates at a

204

smaller scale, we created groups of stations so that this comparison was possible. For that

205

aim, we combined the data from all eDNA and trawling stations within < 20nm of each

206

eDNA station in what we call mega-stations. A total of 30 mega-stations resulted. A mantel

207

test as implemented in the R package ade4 (Dray & Dufour, 2007) was used to explore

208

differences between geographic and Bray-Curtis distances of the mega-stations. The list of

209

species commonly reported from the Bay of Biscay was obtained mainly from i) Basterretxea,

210

Oyarzabal, and Artetxe (2012), ii) the AZTI’s database on fish bottom trawling discards in the

211

area gathered according to EU regulation 2017/1004 of 17 May 2017, iii) the data obtained

212

from fish pelagic trawling during BIOMAN surveys from 2003 until 2019, iv) the ICES

218

We obtained a total of 4,640,913 raw ‘teleo’ reads from which 3,366,264 (72%) were

219

retained after quality check for downstream analyses. The average number of ‘teleo’ reads per

220

sample was 70,131 (Table S2). Using the ‘global’ database, 99.88% of the reads were

221

classified as Actinopterygii or Elasmobranchii. The remaining 0.12% (4,343 reads) were

222

classified as mammals (40.16%) and birds (9.60%), with half of the reads (50.24%) not

223

classified into Class level (Figure S1). Only 14 reads in eight samples were specifically

224

assigned to H. sapiens. From these, two samples did not include the specific blocking primer

225

used, suggesting that samples held very little contamination from external sources. Using the

226

‘local’ database, 99.98% of the reads were classified either as Actinopterygii or

227

Elasmobranchii and, depending on the clustering method used, the number of taxa recovered

228

varied. SWARM clustering yielded 90 OTUs identified at the species level (including 95.5%

229

of the reads) and vsearch, 109 (including 95% of the reads), whereas not clustering reads into

230

OTUs, but using phylotypes, resulted in 116 Actinopterygii and Elasmobranchii species

231

(including 95% of the reads) identified. Further analyses were based on phylotypes assigned

232

to the species level (Table S3) as no additional information is provided by using OTU

233

clustered reads. From the 116 identified species, 50 included more than 10 reads.

234

More than half of the reads are assigned to European anchovy, E. encrasicolus

235

(51.67%), followed by European pilchard, S. pilchardus (27.67%), Atlantic mackerel,

236

Scomber scombrus (4.96%), blue whiting, Micromesistius poutassou (2.36%), white

237

seabream, Diplodus sargus (1.52%) and axillary seabream Pagellus acarne (1.20%), which

238

together represent 89.4% of the reads (Figure 2A). A small percentage of the reads (0.27%)

239

were classified as Elasmobranchii, including seven species such as the Greenland shark,

240

Somniosus microcephalus, the blue shark, Prionacea glauca and the undulate ray, Raja

241

undulata (Figure 2B).

242

As for the four samples amplified with ‘mlCOI’ primers, we obtained 389,665 raw

243

reads from which, 324,731 (83%) were retained for downstream analyses. The average

244

number of ‘mlCOI’ reads per sample retained after quality filtering is 81,183 (Table S2).

245

Using the BOLD database, 89.86% of the reads were classified into Phylum, 80.87% of which

246

were metazoans, and among them 47.88% were classified as arthropods and 2.51% as

247

chordates (Figure S2). Within chordates 74.56% of the reads were classified as Actinopterygii

248

(1.87% of the overall reads), resulting in only seven taxa classified into species (Figure S2).

Comparison with fish trawling

Trawling operations during the BIOMAN survey resulted in a total of 18 taxa caught,

252

from which lanternfishes (Fam. Myctophidae) and mullets (Mugil sp.) were the only ones not

253

classified into species level. Qualitatively, a total of 10 species were identified both from the

eDNA and trawling catches (Figure 3A). Six species were collected during catches and not

255

detected through eDNA, namely Sprattus sprattus, Trachurus mediterraneus, Boops boops,

256

Zeus faber, Trisopterus luscus, and Capros aper (Table S4); from these, there are no

257

sequences for T. mediterraneus and B. boops in the reference database and the fact that we

258

find T. minutus in eDNA suggest that this could be actually T. luscus. To assess the

259

relationship between the biomass of fish caught and the number of reads obtained through

260

eDNA, data from T. mediterraneus and T. trachurus were combined into Trachurus spp. and

261

that from T. luscus and T. minutus into Trisopterus spp. There was an overall correlation

262

between fish biomass and number of reads per species although not significant at p < 0.05

263

(Figure 3B). E. encrasicolus was the most abundant species for both methods, whilst the

264

relative abundance for some species like Dicentrarchus labrax, M. poutassou and S.

265

pilchardus was higher when using eDNA. In contrast, the relative abundance of M.

266

merluccius, S. scombrus and Trachurus spp. was higher in catches than when using eDNA

267

(Figure 3B; Table S4). At a local scale, no significant correlation between eDNA and trawling

268

based abundances was found (Mantel test, r = -0.04 p = 0.646). In fact, eDNA data showed a

269

more constant abundance of the three most abundant species (E. encrasicolus, S. pilchardus

270

and S. scombrus), compared to trawl data, which showed in general a higher number of

271

species per station, except for those eight stations were E. encrasicolus was dominant (> 94%

272

of the catch) (Figure S3).

273
274

Species distribution patterns

275

A significant correlation was detected between species abundance differences and

276

geographic distances between stations both for eDNA (R2 = 0.38 p < 0.01) and trawling

277

stations (R2 = 0.20 p < 0.01). Yet, although for eDNA, pairs of distant stations tend to be

278

more different in taxonomic composition, pairs of nearby stations cover the full range of

279

Bray-Curtis distances (Figure 4). Comparisons between samples within same or distinct depth

280

category (shallow, medium, deep) or within same or distinct sampling methods (eDNA,

281

trawling) had no effect over the observed patterns (Figure S4).

282

The overall compositional pattern of our data showed significant differences between

283

species occurrence and sampling sites according to their zone (e.g., shallow, medium and

284

deep stations) (PERMANOVA F2,43 = 2.24, p < 0.05) (Figure 5). Within the main species

285

contributing to the spatial ordination of our data, two main groups can be broadly observed.

286

On one side, species like E. encrasicolus, M. merluccius, Coris julis S. scombrus, M.

287

poutassou, Lophius piscatorius, S. microcephalus, Xenodermichthys copei, and P. glauca

288

tended to be more abundant in deeper stations and their relative abundances increased in sites

>127m-deep (Figure 6). In contrast, a second loop in the spatial ordination of the data include

290

other species such as Gobius niger, Ammodytes dubius, D. sargus, Argentina silus, D. labrax,

291

S. pilchardus, Mola mola and Scomber colias (Figure 5). This information correlates with a

292

pattern of higher abundance in <90m-deep sites for, e.g., S. pilchardus, D. sargus, M. mola, A.

293

dubius, D. labrax and S. colias (Figure 4B). Relatively to the abundance of reads and station

294

depth, four species, namely A. silus, Glaucostegus cemiculus, G. niger and Pagellus

295

bogaraveo, remain unchanged between shallow and deep stations. Specifically, for

296

elasmobranch species, a pattern nicely correlated with higher relative abundances of typical

297

demersal species like R. undulata in shallow sites and pelagic species like S. microcephalus

298

and P. glauca in medium and deep sites (Figure 6). Species like Labrus merula and Buenia

299

affinis were among the most abundant in number of reads (>1,000 per species) but have not

300

been previously reported for the Bay of Biscay.

302

Discussion

303

This study shows how eDNA metabarcoding provides a comprehensive overview of

304

the fish diversity in a large-scale marine area. Compared to fish trawling, eDNA

305

metabarcoding was able to “capture” a larger number of fish species. Both, eDNA and

306

trawling based estimates (in number of reads and biomass, respectively) indicate that E.

307

encrasicolus represents half of the abundance, which is consistent to the known large and

308

stable anchovy population in the Bay of Biscay (Erauskin-Extramiana et al., 2019; Santos,

309

Uriarte, Boyra, & Ibaibarriaga, 2018; Uriarte, Prouzet, & Villamor, 1996) and with the fact

310

that the BIOMAN survey took place during the anchovy spawning season. The seven most

311

abundant species in fish trawling representing >1% of the total biomass were T. trachurus, S.

312

scombrus, T. mediterraneus, M. merluccius, M. poutassou, S. pilchardus and B. boops, which

313

were all, except those not present in the reference database (B. boops and T. mediterraneus),

314

also found in the eDNA metabarcoding data, and four of them (E. encrasicolus, S. pilchardus,

315

S. scombrus and M. poutassou) were also among the most abundant species from eDNA data.

316

Thus, concerning the most abundant species in the Bay of Biscay, eDNA and trawling data

317

provided comparable conclusions.

318

The following three species were caught during fish trawling but were absent from

319

eDNA data despite being present in the reference database, Z. faber, S. sprattus and C. aper.

320

One possible explanation for this false negative detection could be the little abundance of this

321

species’ DNA in the water, as suggested by the small and reduced number of catches (2.07 Kg

322

in 3 sites, 1.07 Kg in 2 sites and 0.34 Kg in 2 sites, respectively). In fact, a small number of

323

reads, i.e., 591, was also detected for Solea solea, a species from which 0.05 Kg were caught

324

in a single station. If this is the case, filtering larger volumes of water and increasing

325

sequencing depth could improve detection. Alternatively, reference sequences for Z. faber S.

326

sprattus and C. aper could be undetected errors in the reference database (Li et al., 2018), or

327

correspond to alternative intraspecific variants. On the other hand, in accordance with

328

previous studies, eDNA data resulted in about 100 more species (35 with more than 10 reads)

329

than trawling data collected simultaneously (Thomsen et al., 2012; Thomsen et al., 2016;

330

Yamamoto et al., 2017). For example, species such as D. sargus, P. acarne, M. mola, D.

331

labrax, L. piscatorius, Chelon ramada, A. dubius, G. niger, Ctenolabrus ruperstris, A. silus,

332

S. microcephalus and B. affinis were not found in catches, but were more abundant in eDNA

333

reads than the 5th most abundant species (M. merluccius) in catches. The fact that eDNA

334

results in a higher number of species could be partially attributed to the efficiency of the

335

method to detect benthic or coastal species, difficult to catch by pelagic trawling nets, focused

336

on small and medium-size pelagic species. To check to what extent eDNA is able to detect in

337

surface waters (4 m) demersal species we compared the results with the ICES International

338

Bottom Trawling Surveys (IBTS surveys) data for the Bay of Biscay from 2003 to 2019

339

(ICES, 2013) and with the 2017 Pélagiques Gascogne (PELGAS) integrated survey in the

340

same area (Mathieu et al., 2019). eDNA metabarcoding data was able to detect at least 31 out

341

of 164 species reported for the Bay of Biscay by IBTS surveys and 13 out of 45 species by

342

PELGAS survey (Figure S5). Although not being a thorough comparison, as time periods and

343

sampling seasons at least from IBTS surveys are different, the comparison provides an overall

344

sense of eDNA as a potential method for surveying a large marine area in a relatively simple

345

way. Differences in eDNA and pelagic trawl catchability can also explain the differences in

346

relative abundances of the species found by the two kind of sampling methods, such as S.

347

pilchardus, M. poutassou and D. labrax, with higher number of eDNA reads relative to the

348

biomass caught, or T. trachurus, S. scombrus and M. merluccius, showing the opposite.

349

However, similarity between both eDNA and trawling stations suggests that stations further

350

apart tend to be more different.

351

largely affected by the production rate from each organism, diffusion of the molecules in the

352

water and its inherent degradation (Collins et al., 2018; Murakami et al., 2019; Thomsen et

353

al., 2012). But also, PCR amplification stochasticity and sequencing depth are known to affect

354

the number of reads obtained from an eDNA sample (DiBattista et al., 2017; Zinger et al.,

355

2019).

The amount, quality and stability of DNA molecules are

356

T. minutus, a morphologically similar species to T. luscus was identified through

357

eDNA, which make us raise the hypothesis that specimens collected from catches were

358

misidentified as T. luscus, potentially being T. minutus as eDNA revealed. This would not be

359

an isolated case where morphological characteristics difficult to observe hamper taxonomic

360

identification, and other available data (e.g., DNA) is needed for species identification

361

(Dayrat, 2005). A remarkable case are lanternfishes of the Myctophidae, where species

362

identification is based on the morphology and the shape and size of photophores, which are

363

extremely fragile and seldom recovered intact (Cabrera-Gil et al., 2018). In this case, eDNA

364

can play a major role for species identification as this study has shown, where at least five

365

myctophid species were identified through eDNA. On the other hand, erroneous database

366

records or missing sequences can bias eDNA based estimates. The quality and completeness

367

of the reference database is crucial for taxonomic classification of eDNA data (Callahan,

368

McMurdie, & Holmes, 2017). For example, two species were among the most abundant in our

369

dataset, but not reported previously in the Bay of Biscay, namely L. merula and B. affinis. A

370

careful examination suggests that, although L. merula could be misled by its close relative L.

371

bimaculatus, occurring in the Bay of Biscay, the sequences attributed to B. affinis seem to be

372

correctly assigned (Figure S6), suggesting that eDNA was able to detect species not

373

previously reported in the area despite in low abundance.

374

Besides species diversity, eDNA also provides information on species distribution,

375

which is comparable to that expected in the area. For instance, the number of reads assigned

376

to the pelagic species M. poutassou and S. scombrus increased in stations deeper than 90m,

377

where preferred habitats for these species occur (Ibaibarriaga et al., 2007). A contrasting

378

pattern was observed for the greater argentine A. silus, a species commonly found at depths

379

between 50 and 200m (Basterretxea et al., 2012), but found in our data at shallower stations.

380

This could also suggest an incongruence with species identification with a close relative, in

381

this case A. sphyraena commonly found over the continental slope (Basterretxea et al., 2012),

382

but with no 12Sr RNA sequence in our reference database, or DNA from A. silus (even in its

383

form of egg or larvae) dispersed to shallower stations. Similarly, species like S. pilchardus, D.

384

sargus, D. labrax, P. acarne and Alosa spp. showed a distribution for this dataset in stations

385

less than 90m depth, as our eDNA revealed. Available data on the diversity of elasmobranch

386

species in the Bay of Biscay is limited, as most of these species are discarded from

387

commercial fisheries and landing data is incomplete (ICES, 2017; Rodríguez-Cabello, Pérez,

388

& Sánchez, 2013; Rusyaev & Orlov, 2013). Hence, in agreement to previous studies, our data

389

supports eDNA as a potential mechanism for detecting and studying the distribution of

390

elusive and deep-water species, which normally go undetected in fish trawl surveys, e.g.,

391

elasmobranchs, (Thomsen et al., 2016). In any case, eDNA results also revealed an ecological

392

pattern for elasmobranchs. For instance R. undulata, which has a high-site fidelity occurred

393

only in shallow waters (ICES, 2014), whilst large sharks as S. microcephalus, P. glauca and

394

Lamna nasus predominantly occurred in deeper sites.

395

Aside from biological factors (e.g., individual shedding rate, persistence of DNA in

396

the water) that can alter the quantity of eDNA released to the environment, technical

397

considerations can introduce biases on the quality and number of reads generated per species

398

and hence inferences driven from them (Dejean et al., 2011; Lamb et al., 2019; Thomsen et

399

al., 2016). Reference databases are crucial to secure taxonomic assignment for data derived

400

from eDNA samples (Zinger et al., 2019). While recent analyses on the taxonomic annotation

401

of metazoan GenBank sequences suggest their reliability for eDNA metabarcoding studies

402

(Leray, Knowlton, Ho, Nguyen, & Machida, 2019; Li et al., 2018), we encountered the need

403

of including a thorough curation step for our ‘global’ database giving several mislabelled

404

sequences. Species-level annotations were not considered in Leray et al. (2019), and we found

405

incorrectly annotated sequences at all taxonomic levels. As environmental samples contain

406

highly complex DNA signal from various organisms, primer choice is critical for species-

407

level identification (Collins et al., 2019). We found that for our samples, the eukaryote

408

universal COI primers result in a very small proportion of reads assigned to Actinopterygii.

409

This is due to the fact that the primers target a large number of taxonomic groups, so larger

410

coverage is needed for producing robust data (Alberdi, Aizpurua, Gilbert, Bohmann, &

411

Mahon, 2018; Corse et al., 2019; Gunther, Knebelsberger, Neumann, Laakmann, & Martinez

412

Arbizu, 2018; Stat et al., 2017). The use of more specific primers in our study allowed the

413

specific detection of both Actinopterygii and Elasmobranchii. (Kelly, Port, Yamahara, &

414

Crowder, 2014; Miya et al., 2015). Yet the amount of reads attributed to Elasmobranchii is

415

small as ‘teleo’ primers were not specifically designed for this taxa, e.g., Kelly et al. (2014),

416

and recent developments on elasmobranch-specific primers (Miya et al., 2015) could

417

potentially be a powerful tool to increase the elasmobranch diversity in future marine surveys.

418

In addition, for closely related species such as Alosa alosa and Alosa fallax, the target barcode

419

was exactly the same, so being cautious we consider them as Alosa spp. Another crucial

420

methodological step is the clustering method. We showed that using a clustering method (i.e.,

421

vsearch and swarm) decreased the number of identified species, probably because the

422

algorithm merged sequences from different species into singular OTUs. Recent studies have

423

suggested that clustering techniques and the use of percentages of similarities specially in

424

short (<100 bp) sequences might mislead diversity estimates (Calderón-Sanou, Münkemüller,

425

Boyer, Zinger, & Thuiller, 2019; Callahan et al., 2017; Xiong & Zhan, 2018). Thus, procuring

426

a taxonomically comprehensive database with good quality sequences, and accurate data

427

curation steps is crucial for producing robust and reproducible ecological conclusions from

428

eDNA metabarcoding methods (Collins et al., 2019; Weigand et al., 2019). Including a

429

human-specific blocking primer in our samples had little effect, as we indeed detect, although

430

a small percentage (< 0.01%), reads identified as H. sapiens. The use of blocking primers in

431

metabarcoding analysis has been previously used to block dominant taxa in a specific

432

samples, for instance host DNA from diet analysis (Jakubavičiūtė, Bergström, Eklöf, Haenel,

433

& Bourlat, 2017), or human DNA from ancient samples (Boessenkool et al., 2012). Our

434

results suggest that our samples held very little contamination from external sources such as

435

human manipulation, air or input from land.

436

Alternative ways to survey marine biodiversity and unbiased evaluations of the

437

ecosystem components are needed as these provide the baseline for policy implementation in

438

the context of global marine directives (e.g., Common Fisheries Policy or the Marine Strategy

439

Framework Directive). eDNA metabarcoding is becoming a more accessible method that

440

generates reliable information for ecosystem surveillance and invites its application on regular

441

marine monitoring programs (Bohmann et al., 2014; Lacoursière-Roussel, Rosabal, &

442

Bernatchez, 2016; Takahara, Minamoto, Yamanaka, Doi, & Kawabata, 2012). Results in this

443

study have shown that eDNA samples provide information on fish diversity in a broad-scale

444

marine area such as the Bay of Biscay. We detected almost ten times more fish and

445

elasmobranch species compared with pelagic trawling. Some of these species can be

446

considered elusive or difficult to capture with traditional fishing methods. In addition,

447

ecological data was driven from eDNA, thus opening new avenues using molecular methods

448

in broad-scale marine surveys.

Figure 1. Study area and sampling sites for the BIOMAN 2017 survey in the Bay of Biscay.
Triangles represent eDNA sampling sites where station depth was <90 m, squares, eDNA
sampling sites with depths between 90 m and 127 m, and circles, eDNA sampling sites with
>127 m depths. Crosses are located where pelagic fishing trawls were deployed. 100 m and
200 m isobaths are shown.

Figure 5. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) plot, with a stress of 0.15, showing
the similarity of species from each sample based on their relative abundance. The ellipse
shows the 95% distance based on the centroid of the 3 sampling zones groups (coastal, neritic
and oceanic). Spatial patterns of the species with >1,000 reads are shown.
