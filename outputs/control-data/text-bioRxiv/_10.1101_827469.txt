Abstract

14

Bacterial resistance against antibiotics often involves multiple mechanisms that are

15

interconnected to ensure robust protection. So far, the knowledge about underlying

16

regulatory features of those resistance networks is sparse, since they can hardly be

17

determined by experimentation alone. Here, we present the first computational approach to

18

elucidate the interplay between multiple resistance modules against a single antibiotic, and

19

how regulatory network structure allows the cell to respond to and compensate for

20

perturbations of resistance. Based on the response of B. subtilis towards the cell wall

21

synthesis-inhibiting antibiotic bacitracin, we developed a mathematical model that

22

comprehensively describes the protective effect of two well-studied resistance modules

23

(BceAB and BcrC) on the progression of the lipid II cycle. By integrating experimental

24

measurements of expression levels, the model accurately predicts the efficacy of bacitracin

25

against the B. subtilis wild-type as well as mutant strains lacking one or both of the

26

resistance modules. Our study reveals that bacitracin-induced changes in the properties of

27

the lipid II cycle itself control the interplay between the two resistance modules. In particular,

28

variations in the concentrations of UPP, the lipid II cycle intermediate that is targeted by

29

bacitracin, connect the effect of the BceAB transporter and the homeostatic response via

30

BcrC to an overall resistance response. We propose that monitoring changes in pathway

31

properties caused by a stressor allows the cell to fine-tune deployment of multiple resistance

32

systems and may serve as a cost-beneficial strategy to control the overall response towards

33

this stressor.

Importance

36

Antibiotic resistance poses a major threat to global health and systematic studies to

37

understand the underlying resistance mechanisms are urgently needed. Although significant

38

progress has been made in deciphering the mechanistic basis of individual resistance

39

determinants, many bacterial species rely on the induction of a whole battery of resistance

40

modules, and the complex regulatory networks controlling these modules in response to

41

antibiotic stress are often poorly understood. In this work we combine experiments and

42

theoretical modelling to decipher the resistance network of Bacillus subtilis against bacitracin,

43

which inhibits cell wall biosynthesis in Gram-positive bacteria. In response to bacitracin

44

stress we find a high level of cross-regulation between the two major resistance modules and

45

quantify their effects on bacterial resistance. To rationalize our experimental data, we expand

46

a previously established computational model for the lipid II cycle through incorporating the

47

quantitative action of the resistance modules. This leads us to a systems-level description of

48

the bacitracin stress response network that captures the complex interplay between

49

resistance modules and the essential lipid II cycle of cell wall biosynthesis and accurately

50

predicts the minimal inhibitory bacitracin concentration in all the studied mutants. With this,

51

our study highlights how bacterial resistance emerges from an interlaced network of

52

redundant homeostasis and stress response modules.

Introduction

58

Computational approaches significantly improved our understanding of bacterial responses

59

to environmental conditions, which often comprise multiple interconnected modules

60

orchestrated in complex regulatory networks. For instance, mathematical modelling

61

elucidated differences in signalling and signal processing in bacterial chemotaxis in Bacillus

62

subtilis and Escherichia coli (1, 2), contributed to our understanding of how environmental

63

and cellular conditions shape the complex phosphorelay-system controlling sporulation and

64

competence in B. subtilis (3-5), and helped to uncover the regulatory mechanisms of σF-

65

dependent sporulation control in Bacillus subtilis (6, 7). In all of these studies, the overall

66

cellular response towards environmental changes involves an intricate interplay between

67

different regulatory modules, which can hardly be understood without theoretical frameworks.

68

The cell envelope stress response (CESR) is another example for a particularly

69

important, multi-layered regulatory network in bacteria, as it provides effective protection

70

against crucial cell wall-targeting antibiotics, including the antimicrobial peptides (AMPs)

71

bacitracin, ramoplanin and vancomycin. In many bacteria, the CESR involves orchestrated

72

expression of various resistance determinants that protect against these AMPs via an array

73

of mechanisms (8). These include, for instance, changes in cell envelope composition to

74

shield cellular targets from AMPs (9), production of resistance pumps to remove AMPs from

75

their site of action (10), enzymatic or genetic modifications of target structures to prevent

76

AMP binding (11), or the synthesis of immunity proteins to degrade AMPs altogether (12).

77

Although many of the resistance mechanisms are well-described and we have a good

78

understanding of the gene regulatory control of individual resistance modules, the complex

79

interplay and cross-regulation between individual resistance modules remains poorly

80

understood. Given that eight out of the twelve bacterial pathogens on the WHO’s priority list

81

have acquired resistance towards cell wall-targeting antibiotics (https://www.who.int/news-

82

room/detail/27-02-2017-who-publishes-list-of-bacteria-for-which-new-antibiotics-are-urgently-

83

needed), theoretical models rationalizing the cellular response towards such drugs are

84

urgently needed.

85

To address this knowledge gap, we here focussed on the resistance network of B.

86

subtilis towards bacitracin (BAC), an AMP that interferes with the lipid II cycle of cell wall

87

biosynthesis (Fig. 1) (13). Briefly, within this essential pathway the peptidoglycan (PG)

88

precursors

89

pentapeptide are sequentially attached to the lipid carrier molecule undecaprenyl phosphate

90

(UP) by MraY and MurG, thereby forming lipid II (Fig. 1). Subsequently, lipid II is flipped

91

across the cytoplasmic membrane via the flippases MurJ and Amj, where the PG monomer

92

(GlcNAc-MurNAc-pentapeptide) is incorporated into the growing cell wall by various

93

redundant penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). This leaves the lipid carrier in its pyrophosphate

94

form (UPP), which has to be recycled to UP by dephosphorylation (in B. subtilis via the UPP

95

phosphatases BcrC, UppP and, to a minor degree, YodM (14-16) to allow a new round of PG

96

monomer transport. Bacitracin blocks the cycle by forming a tight complex with UPP (UPP-

97

BAC), which efficiently prevents recycling of the lipid carrier and ultimately leads to lysis of

98

cells (17, 18). Like in many Gram-positive bacteria, bacitracin resistance in B. subtilis is

99

mediated by multiple resistance determinants, which are transcriptionally up-regulated in

100

response to bacitracin treatment (reviewed in (19). The most effective (primary) resistance

101

determinant is the ABC transporter BceAB (20), which protects UPP from the inhibitory grip

102

of bacitracin (Fig. 2A) – presumably by breaking UPP-BAC complexes and thereby shifting

103

the binding equilibrium towards the free form of UPP (21). The second line of defence is

104

mediated by the UPP phosphatase BcrC, which increases the rate of UPP dephosphorylation

105

and thereby promotes progression of the lipid II cycle (14, 15, 23, 24) (Fig. 2A).

106

Simultaneously, B. subtilis induces production of the phage shock-like proteins LiaI and LiaH

107

(23,25), which only play a minor role in bacitracin resistance and seem to be involved in

108

stabilization of membrane integrity by a mechanism that is yet to be determined (26, 27).

Expression of bceAB is activated by a two-component system comprising the histidine

kinase BceS and the response regulator BceR (15, 20, 23, 28). BceS forms a sensory

111

complex with BceAB in the membrane (29, 30), which acts as a “flux-sensor” reporting on the

112

antibiotic load experienced by each individual transporter – thereby activating further

113

transporter expression only if their detoxification capacity approaches saturation (21).

114

Expression of BcrC is primarily controlled by the extracytoplasmic function sigma factor σ M

115

(14, 31). While the physiological input triggering activation of σM still remains elusive (32, 33),

116

the broad range of inducing conditions, including cell wall antibiotics, salt, ethanol and others,

117

suggests that it is not a specific chemical compound but rather a cellular cue upon cell

118

envelope damage that activates the σM response (34). Interestingly, despite the seemingly

119

unrelated input stimuli for the BceAB and the BcrC resistance modules – with BceAB being

120

activated by a “drug-sensing” mechanism (=antibiotic flux) and BcrC by a “damage-sensing”

121

mechanism – previous work revealed that there is a high level of inter-dependency between

122

the modules (27). In particular, in mutants lacking the ABC transporter BceAB, the secondary

123

layers of resistance are induced more strongly and vice versa, suggesting that this

124

compensatory regulation is the origin of robust cell wall homeostasis in B. subtilis.

125

In this study, we set out to decipher the regulatory interplay between these two

126

resistance determinants by considering the dynamics of the lipid II cycle as a pivotal

127

connection between drug- and damage-sensing resistance modules. To this end, we took

128

advantage of a recently established computational model for the lipid II cycle, which

129

describes the dynamics of PG synthesis based on biochemical parameters of the involved

130

enzymes and cycle intermediates (35). By integrating the existing mathematical description

131

of the lipid II cycle with a previously established model for BceAB resistance module (21) and

132

a novel theoretical description of the BcrC module (Fig. 2A), we developed a systems-level

133

description of the bacitracin stress response that captures the minimal inhibitory

134

concentration (MIC) of a wild-type B. subtilis strain, as well as several mutants deleted for

135

resistance systems individually or in combination. Additionally, our theoretical and

136

experimental analyses reveal that an increased total number of lipid carriers, i.e. the sum of

137

UP, UPP, lipid I and lipid II, as well as an accumulation of the lipid carrier UPP in a ΔbcrC

138

mutant are the origin of the significantly higher impact of the BceAB resistance module on

139

bacitracin resistance when BcrC is lacking. As our model does not include any additional

140

layers of regulation, our results show that the properties of the lipid II cycle itself contribute to

141

the homeostatic control of the overall resistance response towards bacitracin. Thus, the

142

theory presented here not only provides a comprehensive quantitative description of the

143

bacitracin resistance network in B. subtilis, but also uncovers regulatory mechanisms of the

144

multi-layered response towards this antibiotic.

145
146

Material and Methods

147

Bacterial strains and growth conditions

148

Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli were routinely grown in lysogeny broth (LB medium) at

149

37°C with agitation (200 rpm). Transformations of B. subtilis were carried out as described

150

previously (36). All strains used in this study are derivatives of the wild-type strain W168 and

151

are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Kanamycin (10 mg ml-1), chloramphenicol (5 mg ml-1),

152

tetracycline (10 mg ml-1) and erythromycin (1 mg ml-1) plus lincomycin (25 mg ml-1) for

153

macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (“MLS”) resistance were used for the selection of the

154

B. subtilis mutants used in this study. Solid media contained 1.5% (w/v) agar.

155
156

Luciferase assays

157

Luciferase activities of B. subtilis strains harboring pAH328-derivates were assayed using a

158

Synergy2 multi-mode microplate reader from BioTek® (Winooski, VT, USA), essentially as

159

described in (27). Briefly, the reader was controlled using the software Gen5TM (version

160

2.06). Cells were inoculated 1:1000 from fresh overnight cultures and grown to OD 600 = 0.1–

161

0.5. Subsequently, cultures were diluted to OD600 = 0.01 and split into 100 μl per well in 96-

162

well plates (black walls, clear bottom; Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany). Cultures

163

were incubated at 37°C with linear agitation (medium intensity) and the OD600 as well as

164

luminescence were monitored every 5 min. After one hour, freshly diluted Zn2+-bacitracin was

165

added to the indicated final concentrations and incubation and monitoring every 5 min was

166

resumed for 8h. Specific luminescence activity is given by the raw luminescence output

167

(relative luminescence units, RLU) normalized by cell density (RLU/OD600). Please note that

168

the luminescence sensitivity of the microplate reader used in this study is lower than in our

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/827469; this version posted November 3, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

169

previous work (27), such that for a given strain the relative luminescence units (RLU)

170

reported here are ~10-50 fold lower than previously reported. Also, in the present work we

171

used a more stringent cleaning procedure for test tubes (used for overnight- and

172

daycultures), which completely avoids the use of detergents and instead relies on

173

mechanical cleaning and autoclaving only. With this procedure we found that the basal

174

expression of cell wall stress modules (in the absence of antibiotics) is slightly lower than

175

with the previous procedure, explaining, for instance, why the observed luminescence activity

176

of the PbceA-lux construct in Figure 2B (iii) remains at a low level between 0 μg/ml and 3 x 10-2

177

μg/ml bacitracin and only increases at higher antibiotic concentrations, while we found a

178

slight increase of luminescence activity at these concentrations before (27). These subtle

179

differences in expression levels only affect the qualitative behavior under non-induced

180

conditions (no bacitracin), and neither impact the development of the computational model,

181

nor affect the conclusions from this work.

182
183

Minimal inhibitory concentration assays

184

For concentration-dependent growth experiments, cells were grown as described for the

185

luciferase assays and OD600 was measured analogously. The growth rate within the first hour

186

after bacitracin addition was determined to monitor the concentration-dependent effects of

187

bacitracin on cell growth (Fig. 2B(i)). The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was defined

188

as the concentration of antibiotic that fully inhibited growth, i.e. for which the growth rate

189

equals zero.

190
191

Relative quantitative RT-PCR

192

Bacillus subtilis W168 and ΔbcrC cells were collected at OD600 between 0.3-0.5 (measured in

193

a spectrophotometer) and suspended in Trizol (Ambion). The cells were lysed through bead

194

beating with 0.1mm zirconia beads. RNA was extracted from exponentially growing cells with

195

Trizol Reagent. DNA was removed with DNase (Thermo Scientific) and the DNase was then

196

heat-deactivated in the presence of EDTA. RT-qPCR was performed with the Luna Universal

197

One-Step RT-qPCR Kit (New England Biolabs). 1 µl of 10-fold diluted RNA was added to 4 μl

198

of rtPCR mix and subjected to a reverse transcription step at 55C and 45 cycles of PCR (10

199

seconds at 95C and 30 seconds at 60C). The average CT value of three technical

200

replicates of three biological replicates for each sample was used in ΔΔCt relative expression

201

analysis (37). The reference genes were the constitutively expressed genes recA

202

(BSU16940) and gyrB (BSU00060).

204

Computational model and simulations

205

A detailed description of the model assumptions and equations for the bacitracin resistance

206

network, as well as additional analyses of the model are given in the Supplementary Text.

207

The numerical calculations of the differential equations of the model as well as the individual

208

simulations were performed with custom scripts developed in MATLAB TM software (The

209

MathWorks, Inc.).

210
211

Results

212

The common purpose of the UPP phosphatase BcrC and the ABC transporter BceAB is to

213

ensure progression of the lipid II cycle under bacitracin treatment, since bacitracin inhibits an

214

important step of this cycle (Fig. 2A). Consequently, to study the impact of the two resistance

215

modules on lipid II cycle homeostasis, we successively integrated the resistance modules

216

into a detailed computational description of the lipid II cycle (35). This previously established

217

theory predicts the rate of peptidoglycan synthesis (jPG) of a B. subtilis strain devoid of any

218

inducible resistance determinants under antibiotic perturbation (Fig. 2A, upper central panel)

219

and thus served as the basis of our mathematical model of the overall bacitracin resistance

220

network. In a first step, we included the BcrC module and studied its protective effect on the

221

lipid II cycle (Fig. 2A, left panel). In a second step, we investigated the interaction of the two

222

resistance modules by integrating the pre-existing theory of the BceAB module (21) into the

223

model (Fig. 2A, right panel). In this full model, we were able to study the impact of the two

224

modules on bacitracin resistance, by quantifying the shift in the bacitracin concentration at

225

which the PG synthesis rate reaches its half-maximal level (IC50) to higher values (Fig. 2A,

226

lower panel).

227
228

Impact of the UPP phosphatase BcrC on bacitracin resistance

229

In our previous computational description of the lipid II cycle (35) we made the simplifying

230

assumption that the enzymes involved in lipid II cycle progression feature constant

231

expression levels under antibiotic treatment, but it is known that the UPP phosphatase BcrC

232

is upregulated in response to bacitracin treatment. Also, the model did not include the activity

233

of the BceAB transporter and, as such, was only able to predict the approximate MIC for

234

bacitracin in a ΔbceAB mutant strain of B. subtilis (35). Thus, the first step in arriving at a

235

more realistic description of lipid II cycle homeostasis was to include the bacitracin-

236

dependent up-regulation of bcrC expression into our computational model for the ΔbceAB

237

mutant strain. To experimentally assess bcrC expression in response to bacitracin treatment

238

under our experimental conditions, we integrated a PbcrC-luxABCDE reporter construct into

239

the chromosome of a ΔbceAB mutant and measured luciferase activity 1 hour after addition

240

of various bacitracin levels (Fig. 2B(i), green). The PbcrC promoter activity clearly correlated

241

with increasing levels of bacitracin, leading to a maximal ~6-fold induction at 3 μg/ml

242

bacitracin treatment compared to the untreated condition. In contrast, wild-type cells only

243

displayed a ~3-fold PbcrC induction reached at 10-fold higher bacitracin levels (30 μg/ml) (Fig.

244

2B(i), black), suggesting that the additional expression of bceAB in the wild-type mitigates

245

the demand for bcrC expression, as discussed further below. Furthermore, we investigated

246

the impact of the BcrC resistance module on bacitracin resistance, by comparing the growth

247

of a ΔbceAB mutant and a ΔbceABΔbcrC double mutant. In doing so, we were able to study

248

the resistance contribution of BcrC alone, and avoided any compensatory upregulation of

249

bceAB expression that may complicate the interpretation of a comparison between wild-type

250

and a ΔbcrC mutant strain. By defining the MIC as the lowest antibiotic concentration leading

251

to zero growth rate after bacitracin addition, we observed a 2.3-fold lower MIC value for the

252

ΔbceABΔbcrC mutant (Fig. 2B(ii); light blue star, MICΔbceABΔbcrC ~ 6.3 μg/ml) compared to the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/827469; this version posted November 3, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

253

ΔbceAB mutant (Fig. 2B(ii); green star, MICΔbceAB ~ 14.5 μg/ml), consistent with earlier results

254

(27). This clearly confirmed that the BcrC resistance module by itself contributes significantly

255

to the growth of B. subtilis under bacitracin treatment.

256

Next, we incorporated the observed up-regulation of bcrC into our existing model of the lipid

257

II cycle, with the goal of accurately predicting the antibiotic susceptibility towards bacitracin in

258

the ΔbceAB mutant strain. Briefly, the previous model of the lipid II cycle (35) considered

259

Michaelis-Menten kinetics for all characterized enzymes, while the mostly unknown flipping

260

reactions of the intermediates UPP, UP and lipid II were described by first order kinetics (see

261

Supplementary Text 1 for a detailed description of the model). To integrate the different

262

levels of bcrC expression in response to bacitracin into our model, we modified the

263

mathematical description of the dephosphorylation reaction of UPP. Since the speed of every

264

enzymatic reaction within the lipid II cycle is proportional to the concentration of the enzymes

265

that catalyse the reaction - according to Michaelis-Menten theory - the bacitracin-induced

266

increase in BcrC levels implies an increase in the speed of UPP dephosphorylation (Fig.

267

3A,C). However, the dephosphorylation of UPP is additionally catalysed by a second

268

phosphatase UppP in B. subtilis, the expression of which is independent of bacitracin (14-16)

269

(Fig. 3B). Thus, the total speed of the UPP dephosphorylation reaction is proportional to the

270

weighted sum of the bacitracin-dependent contribution from BcrC and the bacitracin-

271

independent contribution from UppP (Fig. 3C), as indicated in Eq. (1).

273

Here, the factor 𝑥 𝐵𝑐𝑟𝐶 quantifies the fractional contribution of BcrC and 1 − 𝑥 𝐵𝑐𝑟𝐶 the

274

fractional contribution of UppP to the total phosphatase activity in the absence of bacitracin,

275

respectively. Moreover, the upregulation of BcrC levels under bacitracin treatment leads to a

276

fold-induction of the UPP phosphatase activity according to a factor 𝑓 𝐵𝑐𝑟𝐶 (𝐵𝐴𝐶) , which

277

ranges from 1 to a maximal fold-change (Fig. 3A). Thus, the stronger the contribution of BcrC

278

towards the overall phosphatase activity (higher 𝑥 𝐵𝑐𝑟𝐶 ), the more pronounced the

279

acceleration of the UPP dephosphorylation reaction in response to bacitracin (Fig. 3C). To

280

determine the unknown parameter 𝑥 𝐵𝑐𝑟𝐶 , we first assumed that the BcrC protein level is

281

proportional to the detected luminescence output from the PbcrC-luxABCDE reporter in the

282

bceAB mutant (Fig. 2B(i)). We then simulated the model of the lipid II cycle for different

283

values of 𝑥 𝐵𝑐𝑟𝐶 and monitored how the up-regulation of BcrC in response to bacitracin

284

affects the overall rate of PG synthesis (Fig. 3D). Here, it turned out that in case of negligible

285

impact of BcrC to the total phosphatase activity ( 𝑥 𝐵𝑐𝑟𝐶 = 0), the UPP phosphatase remains

286

constant for all bacitracin concentrations, such that the PG synthesis rate decreases

287

hyperbolically with increasing bacitracin concentration, as seen before (35). In contrast, for

288

high values of 𝑥 𝐵𝑐𝑟𝐶 , i.e., in case the total phosphatase activity is dominated by BcrC, the

289

up-regulation of BcrC (and thus phosphatase activity) leads to a speed-up (and thus to a

290

peak) of the PG synthesis rate at intermediate bacitracin levels. Ultimately, this shifts the IC50

291

value – the antibiotic concentration reducing the PG synthesis rate to 50% of its unperturbed

292

rate – to higher values. Studying the dependence of the predicted IC50 values on different

293

values of 𝑥 𝐵𝑐𝑟𝐶 showed that the IC50 matched the experimentally measured MIC of the

294

ΔbceAB mutant when UppP and BcrC have approximately equal contributions to the overall

295

phosphatase activity (Fig. 4A).

296
297

The total amount of lipid carrier is increased under bcrC deletion to ensure close-to-

298

optimal PG synthesis rate

299

If the two phosphatases make approximately equal contributions to the overall phosphatase

300

activity, one would predict that the deletion of one of the phosphatases should have

301

significant impact on cellular physiology even in the absence of cell wall antibiotics. In fact,

302

within our model the deletion of bcrC significantly reduces the speed of the

303

dephosphorylation reaction of the lipid II cycle – leading to an accumulation of UPP

304

compared to a model with wild-type bcrC activity (Fig. 5A,B). Given that the lipid II cycle can

305

be approximated as a closed-loop system in which the total amount of lipid intermediates

306

running through the cycle stays constant (35), the accumulation of UPP simultaneously

307

reduces the concentrations of all other lipid II cycle carriers (Fig. 5B). In addition, especially

308

the shortage of lipid II directly leads to a distinct reduction of the overall rate of PG synthesis

309

of the lipid II cycle, since lipid II ultimately releases the PG monomers for incorporation into

310

the cell wall (see theoretical description of the PG synthesis rate in the Supplementary files).

311

Hence, within the simulated range of BcrC and UppP contributions to the overall

312

phosphatase activity, the lack of BcrC was predicted to reduce the rate of PG synthesis

313

below its half-maximum for some of the parameters tested. Furthermore, the model predicted

314

relatively low IC50 values since the overall PG synthesis rate was already reduced and very

315

small amounts of bacitracin should be sufficient to further decrease it to the assumed critical

316

rate of 50% of its optimal level.

317

However, such a reduction in the overall rate of PG synthesis even without bacitracin

318

treatment would cause clear defects in cell growth, which was neither observable in the

319

absence of bacitracin nor under low bacitracin concentrations when monitoring the growth of

320

ΔbceABΔbcrC mutant strain. Instead, the growth rate of the double mutant was only slightly

321

affected without bacitracin (Supplementary Fig. S1) and the experimentally determined MIC

322

(Fig. 2B(ii), light blue) was significantly higher than the IC50 values predicted by the model.

323

These results led us speculate that B. subtilis uses additional routes to respond to the

324

deletion of bcrC – thereby ensuring a close-to-optimal rate of PG synthesis – probably by

325

increasing the concentrations of lipid II. How does the cell implement this homeostatic

326

control? As previous studies revealed, σM not only regulates the expression of bcrC in

327

response to bacitracin, but also induces individual steps of the methylerythritol phosphate

328

(MEP) pathway (e.g. ispD-F), which is responsible for early steps of lipid carrier (UPP)

329

synthesis (31, 38). Indeed, it was shown that the expression of σM itself is significantly

330

increased in a mutant strain lacking BcrC (15). Hence, we hypothesized that the lipid II

331

concentrations might be homeostatically regulated by σM-dependent control of the production

332

of new lipid carrier. To test this hypothesis, we used RT-qPCR to quantify transcript levels of

333

σM-regulated genes involved in the production of UPP synthesis. As illustrated in Fig. 4B, we

334

found that during exponential growth in LB medium (without bacitracin) expression of both

335

ispD and ispF was 2-fold higher in the bcrC deletion strain compared to the wild-type strain.

336

Furthermore, the UPP synthetase encoded by uppS, which is not part of the σM-regulon, did

337

not show differential expression between both strains (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that

338

the upregulation of early steps of UPP synthesis in a bcrC deletion mutant may increase the

339

overall abundance of lipid carriers in the lipid II cycle, thereby counteracting the bottleneck

340

induced by UPP phosphatase deletion.

341

Hence, we asked how a higher total concentration of the lipid II cycle intermediates

342

(in the following referred to as “LII intermediates”) would affect the model prediction for a

343

bcrC deletion mutant (see Supplementary Text for a detailed description). As we did not

344

know the precise change in LII intermediates in the bcrC deletion strain, we simulated the

345

model for different fold-changes in LII intermediates and predicted the IC50 under bacitracin

346

treatment. Here it turned out that an increase in LII intermediates raises both the lipid II

347

concentrations and the overall PG synthesis rate (Fig. 5C) and thus, ensures progression of

348

the lipid II cycle without bacitracin treatment – as suggested by the fact that growth of the

349

bcrC deletion strain was not drastically reduced when compared to the wildtype

350

(Supplementary Fig. S1). Accordingly, the model predicts that higher levels of LII

351

intermediates in the ΔbceABΔbcrC mutant lead to higher IC50 values under bacitracin

352

treatment (Fig. 4C; dependence along vertical axis). The model also predicts that the higher

353

the contribution of BcrC to the overall phosphatase activity, the higher the required fold-

354

change in LII intermediates to reach the same IC50 values in the ΔbceABΔbcrC mutant (Fig.

355

4C; dependence along horizontal axis). This underlines the idea that upregulation of LII

356

intermediates can compensate for the lack of UPP phosphatase activity. However, we also

357

noted that some of the tested parameter combinations led to predictions in which the PG

358

synthesis rate in the mutant (jPGΔbceABΔbcrC) was higher than the rate in the WT (jPGWT), which is

359

physiologically implausible (Fig. 4C; shaded area). Thus, to arrive at a physiologically

360

plausible parameter set we performed parameter optimization to simultaneously fit the

361

experimental MIC values of the ΔbceAB and ΔbceABΔbcrC mutant strains while meeting the

362

constraint jPGΔbceABΔbcrC ≤ jPGWT. This resulted in a set of parameters in which BcrC was the

363

dominant phosphatase ( 𝑥 𝐵𝑐𝑟𝐶 = 63(±9.5)%) and in which the LII intermediate level was

364

upregulated 6.2( ± 0.7)-fold, resulting in a close-to-optimal PG synthesis rate and IC50

365

predictions ranging closely around the measured MICs for both mutant strains (Fig. 4A,C; red

366

stars). These results are in line with previous experimental studies in B. subtilis (16), showing

367

that a bcrC deletion lead to a stronger reduction in resistance against bacitracin than a

368

deletion of uppP. Hence, by integrating the homeostatic control of the overall LII intermediate

369

level in response to a lack of BcrC, we arrived at a theoretical model that quantifies the

370

impact of BcrC as secondary resistance module on the progression of the lipid II cycle – both

371

in the absence and in the presence of bacitracin.

372
373

Interaction between the BcrC and BceAB resistance modules

374

Next, we focussed on the interplay between the primary and secondary resistance modules

375

BceAB and BcrC, respectively. As noted above, it turned out that the presence of BceAB in

376

the wild-type mitigates the demand for bcrC expression, as reflected in a ~2-fold lower fold-

377

induction in PbcrC activity upon bacitracin treatment in the wild-type compared to the ΔbceAB

378

mutant (Fig. 2B(i); black vs. green line). Vice versa, we found that the PbceA promoter displays

379

a ~10-fold lower activity in wild-type compared to a ΔbcrC mutant, suggesting that also the

380

presence of BcrC reduces the demand for bceAB expression in wild-type cells. These results

381

clearly indicate a high level of cross-regulation between the resistance modules, which we

382

wanted to rationalize via our computational model.

383

In order to complete the computational model of the bacitracin resistance network in

384

B. subtilis wild-type, we next integrated the BceAB transporter into our theory of the lipid II

385

cycle. To this end, we took advantage of a previously developed theoretical description of the

386

BceAB resistance module in B. subtilis (21). Briefly, this model is based on differential

387

equations describing the binding of bacitracin (BAC) to UPP (yielding UPP-BAC complexes),

388

the up-regulation of bceAB expression in response to increasing UPP-BAC complexes and

389

ultimately the release of bacitracin from UPP catalysed by increasing BceAB transporters

390

levels. Here, the relative bacitracin flux (𝐽𝐵𝐴𝐶 ) experienced by each BceAB transporter is

391

described by Michaelis-Menten kinetics,
𝐽𝐵𝐴𝐶 =

[𝑈𝑃𝑃 − 𝐵𝐴𝐶 ]
,
𝐾𝑀 + [𝑈𝑃𝑃 − 𝐵𝐴𝐶 ]

392

where 𝐾𝑀 is the UPP-BAC concentration at which the catalytic rate of BceAB reaches its

393

half-maximal value. Importantly, within this model 𝐽𝐵𝐴𝐶 not only sets the rate at which UPP is

394

released from the inhibitory grip of bacitracin, but also regulates expression of bceAB

395

expression via the flux-sensing mechanism depicted in Fig. 2A and as detailed in the

396

Supplementary Text. Combining this model for the BceAB module with the equations for the

397

lipid II cycle – including the bacitracin-dependent up-regulation of the BcrC module –

398

ultimately led us to a comprehensive computational model for both resistance modules in the

399

B. subtilis wild-type strain (see Supplementary Text 1 for a detailed model description).

400

We then asked whether this full model is in quantitative agreement with the data

401

describing the bacitracin response of the BceAB module in wild-type cells. To this end, we

402

fixed all parameters for the lipid II cycle to the optimal values derived above and imposed

403

that the regulation of BcrC protein levels is proportional to the P bcrC promoter activity

404

measured in the wild-type strain (Fig. 2B(i); black data). Then we estimated the additional

405

parameters describing the induction of the BceAB resistance module by a fit to the

406

experimental PbceA promoter activity (Fig. 2B(iii), black data); see Materials and Methods for

407

details of the fitting procedure and Supplementary Table 3 for parameter values. This led us

408

to a parameter combination for which the model output closely resembles the observed

409

response of PbceA towards bacitracin (Fig. 6A), suggesting that the model accurately captures

410

the cross-regulation between the two resistance modules. Importantly, when studying the PG

411

synthesis rate within this model (Fig. 6B; black line), it turned out that with increasing

412

bacitracin concentration the increasing production of BcrC and BceAB stabilized the PG

413

synthesis rate even in the presence of bacitracin, and increased the IC50 to a value close to

414

the MIC experimentally measured in the wild-type strain (Fig. 6B; black star MICWT ~ 125

415

μg/ml). These results show that the computational model of the bacitracin resistance network

416

now precisely rebuilds the interplay of the two resistance modules and suggests that the

417

simultaneous induction of the two resistance modules jointly mediate lipid II cycle

418

homeostasis under bacitracin treatment.

419

To further test the validity of our model, we demanded that it should be able to

420

correctly predict the behaviour of a ΔbcrC strain, in which BceAB is the sole genuine

421

resistance determinant under bacitracin treatment (Fig. 6A; red data points). Due to the lack

422

of BcrC in this strain, our model predicts that these cells produce higher levels of LII

423

intermediates (similar to the ΔbcrCΔbceAB double mutant), which also leads to a higher

424

abundance of UPP in the cell. This increased exposure of UPP then leads to higher levels of

425

the bacitracin-bound form UPP-BAC in the presence of the antibiotic, which in turn serves as

426

the stimulus for the activation of the PbceA promoter via the previously described flux-sensing

427

mechanism. Accordingly, our model predicts that the accumulation of UPP-BAC in the ΔbcrC

428

strain triggers a ~10-fold higher PbceA promoter activity compared to the wild-type strain (Fig.

429

6A; red dashed line), in qualitative agreement with the increased PbceA activity in the ΔbcrC

430

strain determined experimentally (Fig. 6A; red data points). Also, without invoking any further

431

parameter fitting, for a strain lacking BcrC the model-predicted IC50ΔbcrC = 22 μg/ml closely

432

matches the experimentally determined MIC of a ΔbcrC mutant (Fig. 6B; MICΔbcrC ~ 25

433

μg/ml). This suggests that the simulated response of the BceAB resistance module – in

434

conjunction with the elevated pool of LII intermediates – accurately capture the physiology of

435

the system under bacitracin treatment.

436

One striking discrepancy between our model and the experimental data, however,

437

was visible in the absence of bacitracin, where our experiments showed that the promoter

438

activity of PbceA was also ~10-fold higher than in the wild-type (Fig. 6A). This result is not

439

compatible with the idea that UPP-BAC is the sole substrate for the flux-sensing mechanism

440

via the BceAB transporter (triggering the activation of PbceA), because UPP-BAC cannot be

441

formed in the absence of bacitracin and thus the signalling mechanism should be inactive.

442

However, it was previously hypothesized that UPP itself somehow triggers (futile?) ATP

443

hydrolysis by BceAB and that high levels of UPP may contribute to the activation of PbceA (27,

444

39). Such an interaction seems plausible, given that the recognition of the UPP-BAC

445

complex by BceAB likely involves interactions with both the UPP as well as the BAC

446

moieties, raising the possibility that BceAB has some residual affinity for UPP. Interestingly,

447

as noted above, the model predicts a significantly higher concentration of UPP in the ΔbcrC

448

mutant compared to the wild-type (Fig. 5C) – as caused by the expected increase of the

449

overall concentration lipid II cycle intermediates as well as the reduced overall phosphatase

450

activity in the absence of BcrC. To test if futile activation of PbceA by these elevated UPP

451

levels can explain the higher basal promoter activity observed in the ΔbcrC mutant, we

452

modified the theoretical description of the total load per BceAB transporter, 𝐽𝑙𝑜𝑎𝑑 , which is

453

proportional to the rate of ATP hydrolysis and in turn regulates the promoter activity of PbceA,

454

as follows:

463

respectively. Within these equations an increasing level of UPP increases the overall load

464

465

increase in UPP leads to a reduction of the flux of bacitracin release, 𝐽𝐵𝐴𝐶
, induced by

466

competitive binding to the transporter. Strikingly, by modifying the model as depicted, the

467

predictions of PbceA promoter activation differed significantly between the simulated scenarios

468

(Fig. 6A; red solid line). While the model output for the wild-type equalled the prediction of

469

the former model, the modified model predicted a significant elevation of PbceA promoter

470

activities in a strain lacking BcrC, which closely resembles the experimental data for the

471

ΔbcrC strain (Fig. 6A). Thus, our results of the modified model support the hypothesis of

472

futile activation of PbceA by UPP under BcrC deletion (Fig. 6C). However, since the model

473

modifications did not affect the IC50 predictions of the various mutants (see Supplementary

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/827469; this version posted November 3, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

Text), the effect of UPP on PbceA activation is likely negligible under bacitracin treatment and

475

solely affects the level of basal promoter activity.

476
477

Discussion

478

Building on the experimental characterization of the bacitracin resistance network in B.

479

subtilis (27), we here present the first theoretical description of this regulatory network. The

480

mathematical model developed here not only accurately predicts the efficacy of bacitracin in

481

the wild-type and various mutant strains lacking one or both of the resistance modules (Fig.

482

6B), but also uncovers important regulatory features of the resistance network. By

483

successively incorporating mathematical descriptions of the individual resistance modules

484

into a pre-existing theory of the lipid II cycle, we showed that the interplay between the two

485

major resistance determinants (BceAB and BcrC) is strictly linked to the properties of the lipid

486

II cycle, which change in response to bacitracin.

487

One important insight of our analysis is that BcrC is the more dominant UPP

488

phosphatase compared to UppP - dictating the bulk of the overall UPP recycling rate in the

489

lipid II cycle of B. subtilis. This is also reflected by the fact that bcrC expression is

490

significantly elevated under bacitracin stress (Fig. 2B(i)), while uppP is constitutively

491

expressed (14-16), implying even more pronounced changes in the total phosphatase activity

492

in response to bacitracin than previously appreciated. These results are in accordance with

493

experiments showing that a bcrC deletion significantly reduced the resistance towards

494

bacitracin in B. subtilis, while a deletion of uppP only had moderate effects (14,16). In fact, to

495

ensure a strong protective effect in response to cell envelope stress, it seems physiologically

496

plausible for the cell to activate expression of the phosphatase contributing strongest to the

497

progression of the lipid II cycle.

498

Another finding arising from the combination of theory and experiment was the

499

homeostatic control of lipid II cycle intermediate levels in a ΔbcrC mutant – ensuring the

500

close-to-optimal progression of the cycle despite the lack of the important phosphatase BcrC.

501

To counteract the depletion of the lipid II pool caused by a shortage of UPP phosphatase

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/827469; this version posted November 3, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

502

activity, we found two σM-controlled genes, ispD and ispF, involved in the de novo synthesis

503

of UPP to be significantly up-regulated. While we did not directly prove that this leads to an

504

increase in the overall abundance of lipid II cycle intermediates, our experimental and

505

theoretical results indirectly support this hypothesis in three ways: (1) The ΔbcrCΔbceAB

506

double mutant is significantly more resistant to bacitracin than naively predicted by a model

507

with constant total lipid II cycle intermediate pools, suggesting that a compensatory up-

508

regulation of these pools contributes to bacitracin resistance in this mutant. (2) Under

509

bacitracin treatment the PbceA promoter is ~10-fold more active in a ΔbcrC mutant compared

510

to the wild-type, suggesting that the major substrate, UPP-BAC, of the BceAB transporter is

511

more abundant in the mutant, which in turn triggers stronger activation of PbceA via the flux-

512

sensing mechanism described in (21). (3) Even in the absence of bacitracin the ΔbcrC

513

mutant displays a ~10-fold higher PbceA activity than the wild-type, suggesting that the

514

elevated UPP pool in this mutant is sufficient to trigger some futile ATP hydrolysis by the

515

BceAB transporter, which then activates PbceA via the flux-sensing mechanism.

516

From a systems-level perspective, the up-regulation of lipid carrier production seems

517

to be a particularly elegant way to maintain cycle homeostasis under antibiotic treatment,

518

because it naturally preserves the relative balance between the different lipid II cycle

519

intermediates. In fact, in a closed-loop system like the lipid II cycle, the stoichiometry

520

between the intermediate pools is only determined by the catalytic rates and abundances of

521

the enzymes catalysing cycle progression and not the overall abundance of all intermediates

522

(35). Thus, the sequestration of one cycle intermediate by an antibiotic (such as bacitracin,

523

vancomycin or nisin) will lead to the stoichiometric reduction of all other intermediates. One

524

possible way to accelerate lipid II cycle progression would be the simultaneous up-regulation

525

of all lipid II cycle-associated enzymes. In contrast to such a fine-tuned, orchestrated

526

regulation, our results suggest that the cell compensates this shortage by de novo synthesis

527

of cycle intermediates, which rapidly equilibrates among the different stages of the lipid II

528

cycle intermediates and naturally replenishes intermediate levels in the correct stoichiometry.

529

We suggest that this strategy implements a robust way of ensuring lipid II cycle homeostasis.

530

Although we did not decipher the exact stimulus for activation of the BcrC resistance

531

module, our theory revealed that the regulation of bcrC and bceAB expression are tightly

532

interconnected via the properties of the lipid II cycle itself. Since the activation of the

533

resistance determinants in response to bacitracin go along with significant changes in the

534

concentrations of the different lipid II cycle intermediates, it is plausible that not only BceAB

535

but also the BcrC resistance module somehow responds to these changes. Indeed, it seems

536

advantageous to regulate the overall resistance against bacitracin by responding to changes

537

in the properties of the lipid II cycle, since this does not demand additional regulatory

538

structures for each resistance module, which might be costly to produce and would further

539

complicate the resistance network. More generally, monitoring the physiological state of the

540

pathway itself may serve as a cost-effective strategy to regulate the interplay between the

541

different resistance determinants protecting the cell against cell envelope stress.

542

Ultimately, this study clearly highlights how mathematical modelling provides a better

543

understanding of sophisticated cellular responses towards environmental conditions, in

544

particular antibiotic treatment. By combining existing theoretical descriptions of the various

545

modules of the cellular response, a comprehensive model of the complex network structure

546

evolved. Successive integration of additional modules of the cellular response into the

547

growing model enabled us to study both the basal regulatory features of every individual

548

layer as well as the factors determining the interplay between them within the whole network.

549

We showed that a simple existing model can be expanded to develop a more and more

550

complex picture, and eventually the model itself could even become a building block when

551

describing a network on a broader scale. This approach can act as a blueprint for acquiring

552

true systems-level understanding of complex regulatory structures, not only describing the

553

organisation of resistance system against other antibiotics, but also more generally multi-

554

tiered response networks that can be expected across many bacterial species and a range of

555

environmental stressors.

Figure 1. Scheme of the cell wall biosynthetic pathway and its inhibition by bacitracin.

687

The lipid II cycle of cell wall biosynthesis is responsible for the translocation of PG precursors

688

across the cytoplasmic membrane and represents the rate-limiting step in this process. The

689

cytoplasmic production of UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide (M) from UDP-GlcNAc (G) is catalysed

690

by the MurA-F ligases. Subsequently, at the internal leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane the

691

translocase MraY and the transferase MurG sequentially attach UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide

692

and UDP-GlcNAc to the lipid carrier undecaprenyl phosphate (UP), giving rise to the lipid I

693

and lipid II intermediates, respectively. Various flippases translocate lipid II to the outer leaflet

694

of the cytoplasmic membrane, where penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) incorporate the

695

subunits into the growing PG layer. In order to recycle the resulting pyrophosphorylated state

696

of the lipid carrier (UPP), dephosphorylation by UPP phosphatases (UppPs), including BcrC,

697

yield the initial substrate UP for another round of PG subunit transport. Lipid carrier recycling

698

requires flipping of UP to the internal leaflet by a yet unknown mechanism. Finally, dilution of

699

lipid carriers is counterbalanced by cytoplasmic synthesis of UPP, which involves the

700

isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway with the undecaprenyl pyrophosphate synthetase UppS

701

catalyzing the last committed step. Likewise to UP flipping, the required mechanism to

702

present UPP to the externally acting phosphatases is unknown. Bacitracin inhibits the lipid II

703

cycle by binding to UPP, thereby preventing UPP dephosphorylation and progression of the

704

cycle.

Figure 2. Modular composition of the bacitracin stress response network and its

707

experimental analysis in B. subtilis. (A) Our theoretical model of the bacitracin stress

708

response network is based on three interconnected modules. At the core of the model is a

709

previously established theoretical description of the lipid II cycle module (center panel), which

710

predicts the PG synthesis rate (jPG) of a B. subtilis strain devoid of any inducible resistance

711

determinants under antibiotic perturbation (35). The dynamic variables within the model are

712

the concentrations of the lipid II cycle intermediates (blue bubbles) in the inner and outer

713

leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane, as indicated by the subscripts IN and OUT. To arrive at

714

a model for wildtype cells, we first incorporated the action of the σM module (left panel), in

715

which an unknown cue activates the anti-σ factors YdhL and YhdK in response to cell

716

envelope stress, triggering the release of σM and the concomitant up-regulation of BcrC and

717

an array of further σM-dependent genes. As a second module we incorporated the action of

718

the ABC transporter BceAB (right panel), in which a complex of the histidine kinase BceS

719

and the BceAB transporter jointly act as a sensor for bacitracin flux, triggering

720

phosphorylation of the response regulator BceR and concomitant up-regulation of bceAB

721

expression. Both resistance modules are qualitatively expected to increase resistance (lower

722

panel) by shifting the bacitracin concentration at which the PG synthesis rate reaches its half-

723

maximal level (IC50) to higher values. (B) Experimental analysis of resistance module gene

activity in strains carrying a ΔbceAB deletion, because the flux-sensing mechanism activating

739

PbceA strictly relies the presence of BceAB (21). The coloured stars indicate the experimental

740

MIC values, calculated as the concentration at which a linear interpolation between the data

741

points crosses the zero line. In case of the wild-type strain, the MIC was calculated by a

742

linear extrapolation to the zero line, given that the highest concentration tested did not fully

743

inhibit growth.

Figure 3. Different contributions of BcrC and UppP to the overall UPP phosphatase

747

activity lead to variable levels of protection against bacitracin. To capture the influence

748

of the BcrC module to lipid II cycle homeostasis, the bacitracin-dependent induction profiles

749

of the two phosphatases bcrC (A) and uppP (B) are used as proxies for their contributions to

750

the total UPP phosphatase activity. Given that no biochemical characterization regarding the

751

relative phosphatase activities of the two proteins exists, we introduce the parameter 𝑥 𝐵𝑐𝑟𝐶

752

describing the relative contribution of BcrC (and (1 - 𝑥 𝐵𝑐𝑟𝐶 ) the contribution of UppP) to the

753

overall phosphatase activity in the absence of bacitracin. The bacitracin-dependent overall

754

phosphatase activity varies according to these impacts of BcrC and UppP, as illustrated in

755

panel (C). Integrating the bacitracin-dependent UPP phosphatase activity in (C) in the model

756

for the lipid II cycle (35) leads to predictions for the PG synthesis rate in (D). This shows that

757

the stronger the contribution by 𝑥 𝐵𝑐𝑟𝐶 , the higher the bacitracin concentration at which the

758

PG synthesis rate reaches its half-maximal value, which we define as the IC50. Previous work

759

showed that this IC50 serves as a good proxy for the experimental MIC for various cell wall

760

antibiotics (35).

Figure 4. Calibration of a model integrating the lipid II cycle with the BcrC resistance

763

module. (A) Combining the lipid II cycle module with the BcrC module (cf. Fig. 2A) leads to a

764

model describing a ΔbceAB mutant strain. Predictions of this model for the IC50 value (the

765

bacitracin concentration at which the PG synthesis rate declines to 50% of the unperturbed

766

value) are shown under various contributions of BcrC ( 𝑥 𝐵𝑐𝑟𝐶 ) to the overall UPP

767

phosphatase activity (red line). The linear increase of the IC50 value with 𝑥 𝐵𝑐𝑟𝐶 is the result of

768

the stronger overall phosphatase activity incurred by BcrC up-regulation (cf. Fig. 3C, D). The

769

dashed line shows the experimental MIC of bacitracin in a ΔbceAB mutant and the red star

770

indicates the optimal parameter obtained by in our constrained optimization approach (see

771

Supplementary Text). (B) In the absence of bacitracin, expression of ispD and ispF is up-

772

regulated in a ΔbcrC mutant relative to the B. subtilis wild-type, as quantified by RT-qPCR

773

described in Materials and Methods. Given that ispD and ispF are involved in early steps of

774

UPP de novo synthesis, this suggests that the deletion of bcrC triggers elevated levels of

775

lipid II cycle intermediates, which may in turn compensate for the reduced UPP

776

dephosphorylation rate in this mutant. (C) Predictions of the bacitracin IC50 in a model for the

777

ΔbceABΔbcrC double mutant (color code) as a function of various contributions of BcrC to

778

the overall UPP phosphatase activity (x-axis) and the fold-change of total lipid II cycle

779

intermediates as induced by the bcrC deletion (y-axis). Within this model, the higher 𝑥 𝐵𝑐𝑟𝐶 in

780

the model in the ΔbceAB mutant, the stronger the bcrC deletion in the double mutant

781

reduces the IC50 value. Accordingly, in order to achieve a similar IC50 value (=same color in

782

the background), higher 𝑥 𝐵𝑐𝑟𝐶 fractions require higher up-regulation of the total abundance

783

of lipid II cycle intermediates in this model. The dashed line indicates the experimental MIC

784

of bacitracin in a ΔbceABΔbcrC double mutant. The parameters below the solid black line

785

represent physiologically plausible combinations, in which the PG synthesis rate in the

786

mutant (jPGΔbceABΔbcrC) does not exceed the rate in the wild-type (jPGWT). The red star indicates

787

the optimal parameter set obtained by in our constrained optimization approach (see

788

Supplementary Text).

Figure 5. Model-predicted distribution of lipid II cycle intermediates in the ΔbceAB and

793

ΔbceABΔbcrC mutant strains. The distribution of the different lipid II cycle intermediates

794

without bacitracin treatment is highly asymmetric. The lipid II cycle is located around the cell

795

membrane, which is indicated in grey. Lipid II cycle intermediates are illustrated with blue

796

circles, while the size of the circles correlates with the concentration of the respective

797

intermediate. UPPOUT, UPOUT and LIIOUT represent the fraction the intermediates UPP, UP

798

and Lipid II, respectively, which is located at the outer leaflet of the cell membrane.

799

Accordingly, the fraction of intermediates located at the inner leaflet of the cell membrane is

800

described by UPIN and LIIIN. UPPIN is not displayed, as this lipid intermediate is not directly

801

involved in the lipid II cycle. Lipid I (LI) is solely present on the inner leaflet of the cell

802

membrane. The de novo synthesis of new lipid carrier in the form of UPP is indicated. The

803

thickness of the arrows correlates with the fluxes from one intermediate state into the next

804

one within the lipid II cycle. In addition, the rate of PG synthesis is displayed. (A) When

805

BceAB is lacking (ΔbceAB), the concentrations of the various lipid II cycle intermediates

806

equal the concentrations predicted in the basic model without bacitracin stress response

807

determinants (35). While UPPOUT is most abundant, the concentrations of LI and LIIIN and

808

LIIOUT are two orders of magnitude lower. UPIN and UPOUT are present in intermediate

809

concentrations. (B) When additionally deleting bcrC (ΔbceABΔbcrC), the rate of UPP

810

dephosphorylation is significantly reduced and lipid intermediates accumulate in the form of

811

UPPOUT, as this is the substrate of the respective reaction. Since the lipid II cycle is a close-

812

loop-system (35), all other concentrations are depleted concomitantly. However, as UPPOUT

813

is still the most abundant intermediate in the lipid II cycle, its concentration is not raised

814

significantly. The distinct reduction (>50%) of the concentrations of UP OUT, UPIN, LI, LIIIN and

815

LIIOUT leads to significantly reduced fluxes within the lipid II cycle. In particular, the reduction

816

of the concentration of LIIOUT of ~75% leads to a decreased rate of PG synthesis, far below

817

the half-maximal level. (C) However, the model predicts a nearly unaffected rate of PG

818

synthesis when a 6.6-fold increase in total lipid intermediates (caused by a higher rate of

819

UPP de novo synthesis) in response to bcrC deletion is expected. While the concentration of

820

UPPOUT is massively increased, all other lipid II cycle intermediates are as abundant as in the

821

ΔbceAB scenario. Consequently, the similar concentrations of LIIOUT imply similar rates of PG

822

synthesis in both the mutant lacking BceAB exclusively (ΔbceAB) and the mutant lacking

823

both resistance modules (ΔbceABΔbcrC).

revealing that although the model captures the overall increase in PbceA activity under

832

bacitracin treatment, it does not describe the elevated basal promoter activity in the absence

833

of bacitracin (see Supplementary Text for details). The red solid line shows the prediction of

834

the model when the BceAB/BceS flux-sensing complex recognizes unbound UPP as a

835

secondary substrate, which leads to a futile flux and triggers signaling in the BceRS two-

836

component system. (B) Schematic model behavior in wild-type and ΔbcrC mutant at identical

837

bacitracin concentrations, illustrating that the higher UPP pool in the ΔbcrC mutant leads to

838

higher UPP-BAC levels and thus to stronger activation of the BceRS signaling cascade when

839

compared to the wild-type. (C) The model behavior of the PG synthesis rate under bacitracin

840

treatment for B. subtilis wild-type and mutant cells, generates predictions for the respective

841

IC50 values (arrows), which are close to the experimental MIC values of the corresponding

842

strains.
