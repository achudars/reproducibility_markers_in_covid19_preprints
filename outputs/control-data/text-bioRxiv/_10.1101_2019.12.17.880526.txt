Abstract

33

Most fungal viruses have been identified in plant pathogens, whereas the presence of viral

34

particles in human pathogenic fungi is less well studied. In the present study, we observed

35

extrachromosomal double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) segments in various clinical isolates of

36

Malassezia species. Malassezia is the most dominant fungal genus on the human skin surface,

37

and species in this group are considered to be etiological factors in various skin diseases

38

including dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis, and atopic dermatitis. We identified novel dsRNA

39

segments and our sequencing results revealed that the virus, named MrV40, belongs to the

40

Totiviridae family and contains an additional satellite dsRNA segment encoding a novel

41

protein. The transcriptome of virus-infected M. restricta cells was compared to that of virus-

42

free cells, and the results showed that transcripts involved in ribosomal biosynthesis were

43

down regulated and those involved in energy production and programmed cell death were

44

increased in abundance. Moreover, transmission electron microscopy revealed significantly

45

larger vacuoles for virus-infected M. restricta cells, indicating that MrV40 infection

46

dramatically altered M. restricta physiology. Our analysis also revealed that a viral nucleic

47

acid from MrV40 induces a TLR3-mediated inflammatory immune response in bone marrow-

48

derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and this result suggests that a viral element contributes to

49

the pathogenesis of Malassezia.

Importance

52

Malassezia is the most dominant fungal genus on the human skin surface and is associated

53

with various skin diseases including dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis. Among Malassezia

54

species, M. restricta is the most widely observed species on the human skin. In the current

55

study, we identified a novel dsRNA virus, named MrV40, in M. restricta and characterized

56

the sequences and structure of the viral genome along with an independent satellite dsRNA

57

viral segment. Moreover, we found altered expression of genes involved in ribosomal

58

synthesis and programmed cell death, indicating that virus infection altered the physiology of

59

the fungal host cells. Our data also showed that the viral nucleic acid from MrV40 induces a

60

TLR3-mediated inflammatory immune response in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells

61

(BMDCs), indicating that a viral element likely contributes to the pathogenesis of Malassezia.

62

This is the first study to identify and characterize a novel mycovirus in Malassezia.

Introduction

65

Viruses have been observed in many fungal species since their first identification in

66

mushrooms (1). Fungal viruses, also known as mycoviruses, possess different forms of viral

67

genomes including double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), and

68

single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). It is estimated that 30–80% of all fungal species, mainly

69

endophytic fungi, are infected with viruses. Unlike viruses that infect other organisms, the

70

transmission of fungal virus occurs vertically by cell division or horizontally via mating or

71

hyphal anastomosis, with no extracellular phase of the virus life cycle. dsRNA segments have

72

predominantly been found for fungal viruses and, taxonomically, the fungal dsRNA viruses

73

are classified into seven families: Chrysoviridae, Endornaviridae, Megabirnaviridae,

74

Quadriviridae, Partitiviridae, Reoviridae, and Totiviridae (2).

75

The model fungus Saccharomyces cerevisiae also carries a dsRNA virus that belongs to the

76

Totiviridae family and is known as the L-A virus. A unique feature of fungal viruses of the

77

Totiviridae family is their capability to produce the killer toxin that lyses susceptible neighbor

78

strains, whereas the virus-containing strain (also known as a killer strain) is immune to the

79

toxin. Studies of how the virus produces killer toxins in S. cerevisiae showed that killer toxins

80

are encoded by a satellite dsRNA segment, known as the M satellite, within the L-A virus. To

81

date, four different killer toxins, K1, K2, K28, and Klus have been described (3-6). The S.

82

cerevisiae L-A virus forms icosahedral particles with a diameter of approximately 39 nm (7).

83

The virus possesses a non-segmented 4.6-kb dsRNA genome consisting of two open reading

84

frames (ORFs), gag and pol, which overlap by 130 base pairs (bp) (8). gag encodes a major

85

76-kDa capsid protein (CP), and a 180-kDa minor protein species is encoded as a Gag-Pol

86

fusion protein by a −1 ribosomal frame-shift event (9, 10). The C-terminus of the Gag-Pol

87

fusion protein possesses viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) activity (8). The

88

ribosomal frameshift is an interesting feature in a compact viral genome and has been

89

commonly found in various viral genomes as a mechanism to allow viruses to express

90

overlapping ORFs. Studies of S. cerevisiae L-A virus revealed that the mechanism of

91

frameshifting is based on the sequence structures including a canonical slippery heptamer, 5′-

92

X XXY YYZ-3′ (X= A, U or G; Y=A or U; Z=A, U, or C) and RNA pseudoknot (11).

93

Fungal viruses have also been considered as biocontrol agents in the field of agriculture. For

94

example, a virus causes hypovirulence in the chestnut blight fungus Cryphonectria parasitica

95

(12, 13), and a virus mediates the biocontrol of other phytopathogenic fungi such as

96

Helminthosporium victoriae, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, and Botrytis cinerea (14).

97

Although viral infections in fungal cells are widespread, the interactions between the fungal

98

virus and its host are not well understood. One of the most studied host defense mechanisms

99

is RNA silencing. Several studies have shown that RNA silencing functions as an antiviral

100

defense mechanism against C. parasitica in fungi. Disruption of the dicer pathway in C.

101

parasitica increases the susceptibility to virus infections (15), and p29 was identified as a

102

suppressor that inhibits expression of the genes required for RNA silencing-mediated viral

103

defense in the fungus (16). Similarly, conserved RNA silencing-mediated antiviral defense

104

systems have been identified in Aspergillus nidulans, Rosellinia necatrix, and Fusarium

105

graminearum (17-19).

106

Malassezia is the most dominant fungal genus on the human skin surface and is considered as

107

an etiological factor in various skin diseases including dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis, and

108

atopic dermatitis (20-23). Eighteen Malassezia species have been identified; among them, M.

109

restricta is the most abundant on the human skin (20). Recent studies showed an increased

110

burden of M. restricta on the scalp of patients with dandruff, indicating an association

111

between dandruff and the fungus although its role as a pathogenic organism is still unclear,

112

and the host susceptibility should be taken into consideration (21, 24-27). Most fungal viruses

113

are found in plant pathogenic fungi, whereas few examples of viral particles have been

114

identified in human pathogenic fungi such as Candida albicans (28). In the present study, we

115

observed extrachromosomal dsRNA segments in various M. restricta clinical isolates which

116

represented a novel viral genome and its satellite. Sequence analysis revealed that the virus

117

belongs to the Totiviridae family and that the additional satellite dsRNA segment encodes a

118

novel protein. The interactions between the viral elements and the fungal host, and the impact

119

of the virus on fungal interactions with immune cells were evaluated.

Results

122

Identification of extrachromosomal dsRNA segments in Malassezia

123

Extrachromosomal nucleic acid bands were observed in total nucleic acid extracts of the M.

124

restricta strains isolated in our recent study (29). Among the strains, M. restricta KCTC

125

27540 was used to identify extrachromosomal segments. Total nucleic acids were extracted

126

from the strain and digested with DNase I, RNase A, and RNase T1. The extrachromosomal

127

segments and ribosomal RNA were resistant to DNase I, indicating that they were neither

128

ssDNA nor dsDNA. RNase A degraded all nucleic acids except for genomic DNA, whereas

129

RNase T1, which catalyzes the degradation of ssRNA, removed ribosomal RNA only (30).

130

These results suggested that the extrachromosomal segments correspond to dsRNA, and that

131

M. restricta KCTC 27540 possesses two separate extrachromosomal segments estimated by

132

agarose gel electrophoresis to be approximately 4.5 and 1.5 kb (Fig. 1A).

133

To confirm whether the extrachromosomal segments observed in other M. restricta clinical

134

isolates were also dsRNA, total nucleic acid extracts from the strains other than M. restricta

135

KCTC 27540 were treated with DNAse I and RNase T1. The extrachromosomal segments

136

remained unaffected after enzyme treatment, indicating that they are also dsRNA, as in M.

137

restricta KCTC 27540 (Fig. 1B). Moreover, other Malassezia species including M. globosa,

138

M. pachydermatis, and M sympodialis showed similar extrachromosomal dsRNA segments

139

suggesting that these segments are common characteristics of Malassezia species (Fig. 1C).

140

Agarose gel electrophoresis revealed extrachromosomal segments composed of at least two

141

separate dsRNA fragments except for M. restricta KCTC 27543, which showed a single

142

dsRNA fragment. Additionally, the large fragments of dsRNA showed similar sizes (~5.0 kb),

143

whereas the small dsRNA segments varied in size in different strains (Fig. 1B and 1C). We

144

hypothesized that the dsRNA segments from Malassezia strains represent the dsRNA

145

elements of mycoviruses, which are prevalent in all major fungal taxa (2).

146

Sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation was conducted to purify virus particles to confirm that

147

the dsRNA segments in the Malassezia strains were indeed viral elements. The separated

148

nucleic acids and proteins in each fraction were analyzed. Two dsRNA fragments (~5.0 and

149

~1.7 kb) were clearly visible in fractions 1–6 following agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2A).

150

Moreover, the results of sodium dodecyl sulfate-poly acrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-

151

PAGE) showed that fractions 3–6 contained protein bands with an estimated molecular

152

weight of ~77 kDa (Fig. 2B). This molecular weight is similar to that of the known capsid

153

protein of the S. cerevisiae mycovirus (9, 31, 32). Fractions 3–6 were subsequently evaluated

154

by microscopy to visualize mycovirus particles in M. restricta. Transmission electron

155

microscopy (TEM) images showed virus-like particles with an isometric shape and a

156

diameter of 43 nm (Fig. 2C). These results support the hypothesis that the extrachromosomal

157

dsRNA segments formed the genome of mycovirus in M. restricta KCTC27540. We named

158

the viral particle as MrV40 (M. restricta KCTC 27540 Mycovirus). The large and small

159

dsRNA viral fragments were named as MrV40L and MrV40S, respectively. In addition to

160

evaluating images of the purified virus particle, we examined the morphology of M. restricta

161

KCTC27540 cells containing the mycovirus for comparison with virus-free cells of M.

162

restricta KCTC 27527 by TEM. The results showed that, in general, the size of vacuoles in

163

the virus-containing strain was significantly larger than those in the virus-free strain,

164

suggesting that the virus influences vacuole size in M. restricta (Fig. 3).

165
166

Determination of dsRNA sequence of MrV40L

167

The complete sequence of MrV40L was determined by a combination of the Illumina MiSeq

168

technique and the Sanger sequencing method using purified viral dsRNA. The length of the

169

complete assembled sequence of MrV40L was 4,606 bp, and two overlapping open reading

170

frames (ORFs), designated as ORF1 and ORF2, were identified (Fig. 4A). ORF1 corresponds

171

to the region from nucleotides (nt) 28 to 2,097 and encodes a polypeptide of 689 amino acids

172

with a molecular weight of 77 kDa. ORF2 corresponds to the region from nt 1,949 to 4,538

173

and encodes a polypeptide of 862 amino acids with a molecular weight of 98 kDa. The results

174

of BLAST analysis showed that the protein sequences of ORF1 and ORF2 were highly

175

similar to the capsid protein (CP; the Pfam families of LA-virus_coat, PF09220) and viral

176

RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RDRP; the Pfam family of RDRP_4, PF02123) of S.

segobiensis virus L belonging to the genus Totivirus (Totiviridae family) with 53%

179

motifs, which are commonly found in totiviruses, were found within ORF2, supporting the

180

classification of MrV40 as a totivirus (Fig. 4B) (34). Moreover, phylogenetic analysis with

181

known amino acid sequences of RDRP of dsRNA mycoviruses demonstrated that the RDRP

182

encoded by the MrV40L genome was clustered with totiviruses (Fig. 4C). Thus, MrV40L is a

183

dsRNA viral genome encoding CP and RDRP, and we propose that MrV40 belongs to the

184

Totivirus genus.

185

Next, we analyzed the genomic sequences of dsRNA viruses in other clinical M. restricta

186

isolates to confirm that they were similar to those of MrV40L, and thus belong to the

187

Totivirus genus. RT-PCR was performed using four primer sets corresponding to the sequence

188

of the conserved regions of CP and RDRP in the MrV40L genome (Fig. 5A). The results

189

showed that six of 11 viruses generated RT-PCR products, suggesting the presence of viral

190

genomes similar to MrV40Ls, while the remaining samples had dissimilar viral genomes (Fig.

191

5B).

192

Furthermore, we performed phylogenetic classification of the same viruses found in other

193

clinical M. restricta isolates by multilocus sequence typing of the 1,075-bp region, 638 bp of

194

ORF1, and 437 bp of ORF2, corresponding to gag and pol, respectively, within the viral

195

genomes. The results revealed that the viruses were classified into three clades: clade Ⅰ

196

(MrV12L, MrV16L, MrV40L, MrV79L, MrV80L, and MrV82L), clade Ⅱ (MrV18L,

197

MrV43L, MrV83L, and MrV50L), and clade Ⅲ (MrV24L) (Fig. 5C). Additionally, the

198

sequences of the 1,075-bp region of MrV40L, MrV79L, and MrV82L in the clade I were 100%

199

identical, suggesting that they originated from the same lineage.

Determination of dsRNA sequence of MrV40S

202

To determine the sequence of MrV40S, the dsRNA segments of MrV40S were extracted from

203

agarose gels and then subjected to cDNA cloning and sequencing (See Materials and

204

Methods). Using the partial sequences obtained from cDNA clones and the sequences

205

obtained from repeated 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), we successfully

206

determined the complete sequence of MrV40S. The sequence of MrV40S was 1,355 bp, and

207

a single ORF was identified in the 3′ region (from nt 773 to 1,097) which encoded a

208

polypeptide of 124 amino acids with a molecular weight of 15.6 kDa. The ORF was

209

designated as ORF3. Although we obtained the complete sequence of MrV40S, no

210

homologous protein sequence was identified by BLAST analysis using all currently available

211

databases.

212

Mycoviruses belonging to totivirus, particularly the S. cerevisiae LA-virus, often possess a

213

satellite dsRNA segment known as M dsRNA, which is responsible for producing a killer

214

toxin that excludes neighboring yeast cells. Because MrV40L resembles M dsRNA, we

215

predicted that MrV40S produces a protein that inhibits other Malassezia strains and/or other

216

fungal and/or bacterial cells residing on the skin. To test the toxin-like activity of the protein

217

produced from MrV40S, ORF3 was cloned and the protein was heterologously expressed in

218

Escherichia coli and purified (Fig. 6A). The activity of the purified protein was evaluated

219

against several pathogenic fungi and bacteria including M. restricta, C. albicans,

220

Cryptococcus neoformans, E. coli, and Staphylococcus aureus. Unexpectedly, the purified

221

protein displayed no growth inhibitory effect on the microbial cells tested (data not shown).

222

Based on these results, we concluded that the novel protein produced from ORF3 likely has

223

no toxin-like activity against the microorganisms tested, and further functional studies are

224

required to characterize its function.

225

M dsRNA in S. cerevisiae produce several variants of killer toxins, M1, M2, M3, and Mlus,

226

and they showed limited homology in their protein sequences (4-6). Based on this

227

information, we compared the sequences of satellite dsRNA genomes between MrV40S and

228

that in other M. restricta strains containing the small dsRNA segments. Reverse transcription

229

(RT)-PCR was conducted using a series of primers specific to MrV40S. The results suggested

230

that among the nine strains tested, only the satellite dsRNA in M. restricta KCTC 27582

231

possessed a similar dsRNA segment. These data indicate that the satellite dsRNA genome

232

sequences are highly variable (Fig. 6B).

233
234

MrV40 altered transcriptome profiles in the host M. restricta strain

235

To understand the influence of MrV40 on the host physiology, we sequenced and compared

236

the transcriptomes of M. restricta KCTC27540 containing MrV40 and a strain sterilized by

237

numerous serial passages, named as the virus-cured strain (see Materials and Methods, and

238

Fig. S1). Transcriptome analysis showed that 258 and 809 genes were up- and down-

239

regulated by more than 2-fold, respectively, in the virus-infected strain compared to the virus-

240

cured strain (Table 1 and Table S1). These results indicate that the presence of the virus may

241

impact a number of physiological processes in M. restricta.

242

In S. cerevisiae, numerous genes are known to be involved in maintaining its dsRNA virus

243

(35) and are categorized into two groups: MAK (maintenance of killer) and SKI (superkiller).

244

At least 25 MAK genes have been reported (36); among them, MAK3, MAK10, and PET18

245

were shown to be required for the maintenance of both S. cerevisiae L-A virus and its M

246

satellite, whereas all other MAK genes are responsible only for the M satellite (37-42). We

247

couldn’t find the homologs of MAK10 or PET18 in the genome of M. restricta, suggesting

248

that a different or modified virus maintenance mechanism may be present in the fungus

249

compared to S. cerevisiae (Table 2). The results also showed that among the MAK homologs,

250

MAK1, MAK5, MAK11, MAK16, MAK21, MAK7, and MAK8 were downregulated by more

251

than 2-fold. In S. cerevisiae, these genes, except for MAK1, were involved in 60S ribosomal

252

subunit biosynthesis and M satellite maintenance. Thus, we predicted that MrV40 reduced

253

ribosomal biogenesis within the host. Additionally, M. restricta contained a series of SKI

254

homologs. However, no genes were differentially expressed in M. restricta KCTC27540

255

containing MrV40 compared to the virus-cured strain, indicating that the function of SKI

256

genes was not critical for maintaining the virus.

257

In addition to the genes involved in virus maintenance, we observed upregulation of

258

numerous genes required for the TCA cycle and the electron transport chain, including

259

MRET_1104 (NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) Fe-S protein 7), MRET_1378 (succinate

260

dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) iron-sulfur subunit), MRET_1953 (NADH dehydrogenase

261

(ubiquinone) Fe-S protein 1), MRET_2042 (fumarate hydratase, class II), MRET_2097

263

component), MRET_3173 (dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase) and MRET_4117 (aconitate

264

hydratase) (Table 3). These results suggest that virus maintenance and propagation may

265

require higher energy production in the host cell.

266

The overall dysregulation of primary metabolism may disturb the normal cell physiology in

267

the M. restricta strain infected with MrV40. Indeed, we observed up-regulation of genes

268

involved in programmed cell death in the fungal host cells. For example, the expression of

269

MRET_3200 (p38 MAP kinase), MRET_1134 (programmed cell death 6-interacting protein),

270

and MRET_2499 (autophagy-related protein, ATG101), which are associated with

271

programmed cell death, was upregulated by 4.43-, 3.14-, and 2.83-fold in the virus-infected

272

fungal cells, respectively. Moreover, MRET_0103 (FAS-associated factor), which is involved

273

in Fas-induced cell death, was found to be strongly upregulated (8.80-fold) in the presence of

274

the virus within the fungal host (43). It is well-known that programmed cell death is triggered

275

during virus infection (44, 45), and our findings agree with this observation. Differential

276

expression of numerous genes involved in energy metabolism and programmed cell death

277

may have influenced the abnormally larger vacuole in the MrV40-containing strain observed

278

by TEM (Fig. 3C).

279
280

MrV40 induced the TLR3-mediated immune system

281

Since it was first reported that fungal viral dsRNA induces cytokine production in rabbits (46-

282

48), several studies have demonstrated that Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) plays a central role in

283

viral dsRNA recognition and production of inflammatory cytokines in innate immune cells

284

(49, 50). Additionally, a recent study showed that S. cerevisiae viral dsRNA stimulates the

285

immune system through TLR3 in a human embryonic kidney cell line (51). We therefore

286

investigated whether MrV40 itself or the virus-containing Malassezia cells alter the

287

expression patterns of TLRs and cytokine production in mammalian cells. To this end, bone

288

marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) obtained from C57BL/6 mice, which have been

289

used as a model to study the interactions between fungal cells, including Malassezia, and the

290

innate immune system in a mammalian host (52, 53), were used in our study.

restricta strains (KCTC 27540 and KCTC 27550), and virus-free M. restricta strains (KCTC

293

27527 and KCTC 27539) were co-incubated with BMDCs, and the expression of TLRs and

294

cytokines were analyzed. First, we found that TLR3 expression was significantly induced by
14

295

purified dsRNA, whereas the expression of other TLRs were unchanged. These results were

296

supported by observation of highly increased expression of TLR3 in the cell lysates of the

297

virus-infected Malassezia strains KCTC 27527 and KCTC 27539 compared to virus-free

298

strains. However, the purified capsid protein from MrV40 did not alter the expression level of

299

any TLR, indicating that dsRNA, but not the capsid protein, induced TLR3 expression (Fig.

300

7A).

301

We also evaluated the expression of several inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis

302

factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, interferon (IFN)-α and IFN-γ, in response to

303

MrV40 dsRNA, capsid protein, and M. restricta cell extracts with or without the virus.

304

Particularly, IFN-α and IFN-γ were examined because they are known to be involved in the

305

antiviral response in mammals (54). The results of the cytokine analysis indicated that

306

purified MrV40 dsRNA and the cell extracts of the M. restricta strains containing the virus

307

showed significantly increased production of all cytokines tested. However, a relatively small

308

increase was observed in BMDCs treated with purified capsid protein, suggesting that the

309

MrV40 capsid contributes to cytokine production, but the contribution of the protein is

310

marginal (Fig. 7B). Cytokine profiles were also measured in homozygous TLR3 knockout

311

mice, as our observations suggested a connection between TLR3 and cytokine production

312

upon MrV40 treatment. As shown in Fig. 7B, compared to wild-type BMDCs, cytokine levels

313

in BMDCs isolated from TLR3 knockout mice were not significantly altered. These data

314

suggest that increased production of the cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-α, and IFN-γ in

315

response to MrV40 was TLR3-dependent in BMDCs. Our data also showed that the MrV40

316

capsid proteins caused a marginal increase in cytokine expression in both wild-type and TLR3

317

knockout BMDCs, indicating that the response to the viral capsid is TLR3-independent.

318

Notably, small increases in the production of TNF-α and IFN-α in TLR3 knockout mice in

319

response to the cell extract of virus-infected M. restricta KCTC 27540 were ignored in our

320

results because only one sample among the two virus-infected strains displayed an increase.

321

The change in IL-10 in the same mutant BMDCs was also excluded because the differences

322

were statistically insignificant. Overall, our data suggest that dsRNA in MrV40 triggers an

323

increase in the production of cytokines involved in inflammation and that TLR3 plays a

324

central role in the host response.

325
326

Discussion

327

In the current study, we detected dsRNA virus in several clinical isolates of Malassezia

328

species. Among them, MrV40 identified in M. restricta KCTC 27540 was selected, and its

329

genome structure, effects on host gene expression, and influence on the mammalian immune

330

response were evaluated. Our data showed that MrV40 consists of two RNA segments, which

331

we named as MrV40L and MrV40S. The results of genome sequence analysis suggested that

332

these segments were 4,606 and 1,355 bp, respectively, and belong to the totivirus. Typically,

333

the genomes of the viruses belonging to the genus Totivirus consist of non-segmented dsRNA

334

with sizes between 4.6 and 7.0 kb, and contain two ORFs, gag and pol. Studies have

335

specifically examined the genome structure of Totivirus because of the overlapping nature of

336

the two ORFs, where a -1 frameshift occurs, resulting translation of the fusion protein (2).

337

The overlapping ORFs and frameshift were frequently observed in a compact viral genome to

338

translate proteins and were found in several dsRNA and ssRNA viruses; these ORFs allow

339

ribosomes to translate CP and RDRP continuously with a missing CP termination codon (11,

340

55, 56). It was reported that the mechanism of frameshifting in the viral genome is based on
16

341

the pseudoknot structure of the mRNA for efficient slipping via a slippery site (57). For

342

example, in the genome of the S. cerevisiae L-A virus, the 5′ ORF (gag) encodes a 76-kDa

343

CP and the 3′ ORF (pol) encodes an RDRP which is expressed as a 180-kDa CP-RDRP

344

fusion protein generated by a -1 ribosomal frameshift (8, 11). In our study, MrV40L (the

345

major dsRNA segment in MrV40) contained two overlapping ORFs, ORF1 and ORF2. We

346

identified a putative slippery site heptamer, 5′-GGGTTTT-3′, at the region from nt 1, 968 to

347

1,974 for the -1 ribosomal frameshift, which may be associated with production of the fusion

348

protein of 170 kDa in MrV40L. A previous study suggested that in the S. cerevisiae L-A virus,

349

the rate of ribosomal frameshifs was approximately 1.8%, giving 120 CP and 2 CP-RDRP

350

fusion protein molecules per virus particle (11). Considering the low efficiency of producing

351

the fusion proteins by ribosomal frameshifting, we expected to observe a significantly lower

352

translation rate of the fusion protein; indeed, the putative 170-kDa band was not detected by

353

SDS-PAGE. In addition to MrV40L, we determined the sequence of the satellite dsRNA

354

segment MrV40S and found that it consists of 1,355 nt containing a single ORF, ORF3,

355

producing a novel 15.6-kDa protein. As observed for other totiviruses, the possible toxin-like

356

activity of the protein was investigated in our study, but no growth inhibitory activity against

357

several bacteria and fungi was observed.

358

It has been estimated that 30–80% of fungal species in nature are infected with viruses, and a

359

fungal host normally shows no specific symptoms upon infection (14). However, several

360

genes were shown to be required for maintaining and propagating viruses in the host fungal

361

cells. In S. cerevisiae, numerous chromosomal genes are known to be involved in viral

362

propagation and expression of the viral killer toxin (35). Furthermore, several genes are

363

known to be responsible for maintaining the L-A virus and M dsRNA in S. cerevisiae. The

364

MAK genes are required for the propagation and maintenance of the L-A virus and M dsRNA
17

365

in S. cerevisiae (58). Among the MAK genes, MAK3, MAK10, and PET18 are required for the

366

maintenance of both L-A virus and M dsRNA, whereas all other MAK genes are responsible

367

only for M dsRNA (37-42). Particularly, MAK3 encodes an N-acetyltransferase and is

368

required for N-acetylation of the coat protein (37, 59). A previous study showed that the coat

369

proteins without acetylation failed to self-assemble, resulting in the loss of all dsRNA viruses

370

(38). MAK10 and PET18 (MAK30+MAK31) encode a non-catalytic subunit of N-terminal

371

acetyltransferase and a protein of unknown function, respectively. Mutant strains lacking

372

each gene contained unstable viral particles, indicating that the genes are involved in the

373

structural stability of LA-virus and M dsRNA (39). MAK1 (MAK17, TOP1) encodes DNA

374

topoisomerase I, and other MAK genes including MAK2, MAK5, MAK11, MAK16, MAK21,

375

MAK7 (RPL4A), MAK8 (TCM1), and MAK18 (RPL41B) are related to 60S ribosomal subunit

376

assembly (42, 60, 61). All mutant stains lacking the above genes showed decreased levels of

377

free 60S ribosomal subunits and the inability to maintain M dsRNA, suggesting that stable

378

propagation of the satellite dsRNA depends on 60S ribosome synthesis (41, 42). In addition

379

to the MAK genes, the SKI gene family has been shown to be involved in the maintenance

380

and propagation of virus in S. cerevisiae. SKI1 (XRN1) encoding a 5′-3′ exonuclease is

381

involved in the degradation of uncapped mRNA including viral mRNA, and SKI2, SKI3,

382

SKI6, SKI7, and SKI8 block the translation of viral mRNAs (62-64).

383

In the current study, homologs of most MAK and SKI genes were identified in M. restricta.

384

The results of the transcriptome analysis suggested that most MAK genes were downregulated,

385

which may in turn reduce ribosome synthesis in the M. restricta strain containing MrV40. In

386

contrast, no SKI homolog showed significantly altered transcript levels in the M. restricta

387

strain harboring MrV40. Moreover, we found increased expression of genes involved in

388

energy metabolism and programmed cell death in the M. restricta strain containing the virus.

389

Overall, our transcriptome analysis revealed that the expression of only a few genes was

390

altered upon virus infection in M. restricta. Although the differential expression patterns

391

differed from that of M. restricta, S. cerevisiae also displayed relatively small changes in

392

fungal host gene expression upon virus infection, possibly because of co-adaptation of the

393

virus within the fungal host (65). Maintenance and propagation of virus within the fungal

394

host may be involved in the post-transcriptional mechanism and may contribute to the

395

minimal changes in host gene expression. Notably, the possibility that an RNA silencing

396

pathway in M. restricta cells influences virus maintenance was excluded because of the

397

absence of homologous genes required for the pathway in the genome of the fungus.

398

In addition to transcriptome analysis, we directly investigated whether the virus influences

399

the cellular morphology of M. restricta and the structures of its intracellular organelles by

400

TEM. We observed significantly larger vacuoles in virus-infected M. restricta cells. An

401

increased vacuole size upon virus infection has been reported previously. The

402

phytopathogenic fungus Botrytis porri infected with dsRNA virus 1 showed the formation of

403

abundant vacuoles (66), and turnip mosaic virus induced the large central vacuole in

404

Nicotiana benthamiana plant cells (67). Particularly, in N. benthamiana, turnip mosaic virus

405

particles were shown to accumulate in vacuoles and be protected by the organelle membranes

406

against the harsh host environment, particularly during xylem vessel differentiation.

407

Furthermore, virus accumulation in vacuoles in plant-to-plant virus transmission has been

408

suggested (67). Although the expression of genes involved in vacuole biogenesis was not

409

altered in transcriptome analysis in M. restricta cells containing the virus, there may be a

410

relationship between vacuole functions and MrV40 in M. restricta. Therefore, additional

411

physiological studies are needed.

412

TLR3 is well-conserved in most vertebrates, localizes on the endosomal transmembrane, and

413

plays a role in immune and non-immune cells. It has been suggested that TLR3 senses viral

414

dsRNA taken up through endocytosis and contributes to defending the host against viral

415

infection by regulating the expression of a range of cytokines (49, 68). A previous study

416

demonstrated a significant decrease in cytokines (IFN-α/β, IFN-γ, and IL-12p40) and increase

417

in viral PFU in the spleen of Tlr3−/− mice infected with mouse cytomegalovirus (69). We

418

found that TLR3 expression was significantly increased by purified dsRNA from the MrV40

419

particles and cell lysates of M. restricta containing the virus. The dsRNA and cell lysates also

420

showed increased production of cytokines involved in inflammation. However, in Tlr3−/−

421

BMDCs, the production of all cytokines in the cells treated with purified dsRNA from

422

MrV40 and cell lysates of virus containing M. restricta was attenuated, suggesting that TLR3

423

plays a central role in the host response against dsRNA of MrV40 and mediates the

424

production of the cytokines. Similarly, the Leishmania parasite L. guyanensis infected with

425

the dsRNA virus belonging to Totivirus induced a TLR3-mediated inflammatory immune

426

response within the vertebrate host, indicating that the Leishmania RNA virus (LRV1)

427

functions as an innate immunogen. Moreover, in Leishmania, LRV1 was suggested to

428

stimulate the inflammatory immune response and increase the severity and persistence of the

429

parasite (70). However, whether MrV40 causes hyper- or hypo-pathogenesis of M. restricta

430

remains unclear. Therefore, further studies to characterize the potential function of MrV40 as

431

an innate immunogen are needed.

432

Overall, our study demonstrated the existence of a dsRNA virus within M. restricta. We also

433

determined the sequences and structure of the viral genome along with the independent RNA

segment. Moreover, we identified viruses not only from different strains of M. restricta but

435

also from other Malassezia species, although variation in the viral genomes was observed.

436

Evidence that the viral nucleic acid from MrV40 induces a TLR3-mediated inflammatory

437

immune response was obtained, suggesting that a viral element contributes to the

438

pathogenesis of Malassezia.

were obtained as previously described and cultured on Leeming and Notman agar (LNA)

medium at 34°C for 3 days (29, 71-73). Among these strains, M. restricta KCTC 27540 was

1 mL of 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and the suspension was centrifuged at

458

16,000 g at 4°C for 30 min to remove large particles. The supernatant was overlaid on

459

sucrose solution with a gradient concentration ranging from 10% to 40% (w/v) and

460

centrifuged at 70,000 g at 4°C for 2 h. Fractions (700 μL/each fraction) were collected from

461

the top of the ultracentrifuged sucrose gradient solution. Each fraction was analyzed by 1%

462

agarose gel electrophoresis and 8% SDS-PAGE to detect dsRNA segments and protein,

respectively. Methods for cell fixation and TEM are described in the Supplementary

Determination of MrV40L and MrV40S sequences

467

The reference genome sequence was required to obtain the complete sequence of MrV40L by

468

Illumina Miseq. We first obtained the partial fragment of MrV40L and determined its

469

nucleotide sequence. Briefly, 1 μg of cDNA obtained as described above was amplified using

470

1 μM of the tagged oligo_1 primer to bind the tag and 1.25 units of Taq DNA polymerase

471

(BIONEER, Daejeon, Korea). The amplicons were cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega,

472

Madison, WI, USA), transformed into E. coli DH10B, and sequenced with the universal M13

473

primers. The resulting partial sequences of MrV40L showed high similarity with the genome

474

of Scheffersomyces segobiensis virus L isolate NRRL Y-11571, which was used to assemble

475

the reference genome in our study. To sequence the entire genome of the virus from M.

restricta KCTC 27540, dsRNA was purified using Cellulose A (Advantec, Taipei, Taiwan)

from total cell extract as described previously (74). After purification, purified dsRNA was

remaining genomic DNA remained. The sequencing library was constructed using the TruSeq

480

Stranded Total RNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) following the

481

manufacturer’s instructions and excluding poly-A selection. The resulting library was

482

sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq instrument according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

483

The generated raw sequences, 250-bp paired-end reads, were assembled by CLC Genomics

484

Workbench v7.5 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and the resulting contigs were identified by

485

BLASTN of the NCBI nucleotide database. Based on the reference genome, two contigs of

486

MrV40L were assembled. The gap between the contigs was sequenced by gap-filling RT-PCR

487

using primers Linkage1_V40 and Linkage2_V40) (see Table S2), and both termini were

488

sequenced by RACE PCR using a 5′/3′ RACE Kit, 2nd Generation (Roche, Basel, Switzerland)

489

according to the 5′ RACE protocol described by the manufacturer.

490

To determine the MrV40S genome, the RACE PCR method was used because we failed to

491

find any contig of MrV40S. Like MrV40L, the partial sequence of cDNA from MrV40S was

492

amplified using the tagged oligo_1 primer. The amplicons were cloned into the pGEM-T

493

vector (Promega) and sequenced. Using the partial sequence obtained, 5′ RACE PCR was

494

performed and repeated until no additional sequence was found.

In silico analysis

497

To identify the ORFs in MrV40L and MrV40S, the nucleotide sequences of the genomes

498

were analyzed by ORFfinder (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/orffinder/). To predict ribosomal

499

frameshift signals, a putative slippery site was identified using FSFinder2 (75). The amino

acid sequences of CP and RDRP of MrV40L were analyzed using the Pfam database

phylogenetic reconstruction analysis was performed by the neighbor-joining method with

505

1,000 bootstrap replications (77, 78).

506
507

Mice and cell culture

508

Wild-type C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Orient Bio Co. (Gyeonggi-do, Korea). TLR3-/-

509

(B6;129S1-Tlr3tm1Flv/J, 005217) mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor,

510

ME, USA). All animal experimental procedures were reviewed and approved by the

511

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Hanyang University (protocol 2018-0085)

512

and performed in accordance with Korean Food and Drug Administration guidelines. All

513

animals were maintained in a specific pathogen-free environment. Primary BMDCs were

514

isolated from C57BL/6 mice and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium for 3–5

515

days in the presence of 20 ng/mL recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating

516

factor (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) as described previously (79). Cell cultures

517

were stained to detect dendritic cells with CD11c-FITC (eBiosciences, San Diego, CA, USA).

518
519

Cytokine measurement

520

Mouse cytokines in the culture supernatants were measured with a BD OptEIA ELISA set

521

(BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) as described previously (80). All assays were

522

performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and

523

lipopolysaccharide served as a negative and positive controls, respectively.

MrV40L_RDRP_F2 and MrV40L_RDRP_R2 (see Table S2 in supplemental material). (C)

910

MrV-Ls were clustered into three clades (clade Ⅰ, Ⅱ, and Ⅲ). Multiple alignment of

911

nucleotide sequences of combined parts of gag and pol from 11 MrV-Ls was analyzed by the

912

neighbor-joining method with bootstrap test (1,000 replicates) in MEGA X (78, 81, 82). The

913

evolutionary distances are in units of the number of base substitutions per site.

920

ORF3 was heterologously expressed in E. coli and purified using a His-tag column. (B) RT-

921

PCR results. The primers specific to MrV40S were used to amplify satellite dsRNA from

922

other M. restricta strain containing small dsRNA segments. The following primers were used:

923

lane 1, MrV40S_F5 and V40S_SP1; lane 2, MrV40S_ORF_F1 and MrV40S_R1 (see Table
