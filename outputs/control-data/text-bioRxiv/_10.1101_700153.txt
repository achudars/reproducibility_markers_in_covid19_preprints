Abstract:
Knowledge about synthetic lethality can be applied to enhance the efficacy of

12

anti-cancer therapies in individual patients harboring genetic alterations in their cancer

13

that specifically render it vulnerable. We investigated the potential for high-resolution

14

phenomic analysis in yeast to predict such genetic vulnerabilities by systematic,

15

comprehensive, and quantitative assessment of drug-gene interaction for gemcitabine

16

and cytarabine, substrates of deoxycytidine kinase that have similar molecular structures

17

yet distinct anti-tumor efficacy. Human deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) was conditionally

18

expressed in the S. cerevisiae genomic library of knockout and knockdown (YKO/KD)

19

strains, to globally and quantitatively characterize differential drug-gene interaction for

20

gemcitabine and cytarabine. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that autophagy,

21

histone modification, chromatin remodeling, and apoptosis-related processes influence

22

gemcitabine specifically, while drug-gene interaction specific to cytarabine was less

23

enriched in Gene Ontology. Processes having influence over both drugs were DNA

24

repair and integrity checkpoints and vesicle transport and fusion. Non-GO-enriched

25

genes were also informative. Yeast phenomic and cancer cell line pharmacogenomics

26

data were integrated to identify yeast-human homologs with correlated differential gene

Introduction:

38

Genomics has enabled targeted therapy aimed at cancer driver genes and

39

oncogenic addiction [1], yet traditional cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents remain among

40

the most widely used and efficacious anti-cancer therapies [2]. Changes in the genetic

41

network underlying cancer can produce vulnerabilities to cytotoxic chemotherapy that

42

further influence the therapeutic window and provide additional insight into their

43

mechanisms of action [3,4]. A potential advantage of so-called synthetic lethality-based

44

treatment strategies is that they could have efficacy against passenger gene mutation or

45

compensatory gene expression, while classic targeted therapies are directed primarily at

46

driver genes (Fig. 1A). Quantitative high throughput cell array phenotyping of the yeast

47

knockout and knockdown libraries provides a phenomic means for systems level, high-

48

resolution modeling of gene interaction [5-9], which is applied here to predict cancer-

49

relevant drug-gene interaction through integration with cancer pharmacogenomics

50

resources (Fig. 1B).

51

Nucleoside analogs include a diverse group of compounds with anticancer,

52

antiviral, and immunosuppressive efficacy [10]. The anti-cancer agents have tissue-

53

specific efficacy ranging from solid tumors to leukemias, yet details about how these

54

agents confer differential activity are unknown [10,11]. Gemcitabine (2’,2’-difluoro 2’-

55

deoxycytidine, dFdC) and cytarabine (Ara-C) are deoxycytidine analogs that undergo

56

the first step of conversion to their active triphosphate forms by deoxycytidine kinase

57

(dCK) (Fig. 1C). The nucleoside triphosphate analogs can be incorporated into DNA and

58

inhibit the functions of polymerases and other enzymes involved of DNA metabolism.

59

For example, gemcitabine inhibits ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), which limits the

60

production of deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs) that are needed for DNA synthesis and

61

repair [11]. Gemcitabine has been used as a single agent in the treatment of some

62

cancers, such as pancreatic, and in combination with platinum-based drugs in non-small

63

cell lung, breast, and ovarian cancers [12-15]. Cytarabine, on the other hand, has been

64

an important agent in treatments for acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic

65

leukemia [16].

66

Deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) phosphorylates deoxycytidine to deoxycytidine

67

monophosphate (dCMP), similarly phosphorylating gemcitabine and cytarabine to

68

dFdCMP and AraCMP, respectively. UMP/CMP kinase and the nucleoside diphosphate

69

kinase are subsequently involved in conversion to the triphosphate form (Fig. 1C).

70

Reduced expression of dCK or high expression of RNR subunits RRM1 and RRM2 is

71

associated with increased gemcitabine resistance [10,12,17-21]. Genomic analyses have

72

suggested genetic influences on the efficacy of gemcitabine or cytarabine [22-26], which

73

we model here at a systems level by surveying gene-drug interaction to elucidate biology

74

underlying differential anti-cancer efficacies of the respective drugs, and thereby aid in

75

predicting treatment outcomes based on individual patient cancer genetic profiles.

76

Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not have a dCK homolog and is thus naturally

77

resistant to gemcitabine and cytarabine. To examine the gene-drug interaction networks

78

for gemcitabine and cytarabine in yeast, we introduced human dCK into the yeast

79

knockout and knockdown (YKO/KD) library by the synthetic genetic array (SGA) method

80

[27-29], and conducted phenomic analysis on the resulting double mutant library by

81

quantitative high throughput cell array phenotyping (Q-HTCP) [6-8,30], using multiple

82

growth inhibitory concentrations of gemcitabine or cytarabine (Fig. 1B). Cell proliferation

83

parameters (CPPs) obtained by Q-HTCP were used to quantify and compare drug-gene

84

interaction for gemcitabine vs. cytarabine. The unbiased results provide a systems level

85

resource of genetic and biological information about the cytotoxicity of these drugs,

86

incorporating knowledge about genes that either buffer or promote their effects [3,5]

87

Recent advances in cancer pharmacogenomics have provided gene expression

88

and drug sensitivity data from hundreds of cancer cell lines, establishing associations

89

between gene expression and anti-cancer efficacy for many compounds, including

90

gemcitabine and cytarabine [31-33]. We investigated the potential utility of a yeast

91

phenomic model of chemotherapy sensitivity and resistance for predicting causality in

92

correlations between differential gene expression and drug sensitivity by generating a

93

network-level drug-gene interaction resource. The resource integrates cancer

94

pharmacogenomic and yeast phenomic data, using the results to query the cancer

95

genetics literature in order to obtain systems level biological insights about how yeast

96

phenomic models help predict cytotoxic chemotherapy efficacy based on unique genetic

97

alterations specific to each individual patient’s cancer (Fig. 1A).

102

the context of driver gene-mediated oncogenesis. Driver genes promote cancer and

103

influence the expression of passenger genes (black arrows), which also leads to

104

genomic instability and alterations in the genetic buffering network. The genetic buffering

network (blue arrows) maintains cellular homeostasis, and is altered in cancer cells by

genomic instability, thereby creating the potential for drug-gene interaction that

increases the therapeutic window of anti-cancer agents (red arrows). Drug-gene

108

interaction can either involve driver or passenger genes directly, or the compromised

109

genetic buffering network, which are systematically characterized by the quantitative

110

yeast phenomic model. (B) The synthetic genetic array (SGA) method was used to

111

enable tet-inducible human dCK expression in the yeast knockout and knockdown

(YKO/KD) collection. The phenomic model incorporates treatment of individually grown

cultures of the YKO/KD collection, and 768 replicate Ref strain cultures, with increasing

HLD media, with dCK induced by addition of doxycycline. Drug-gene interaction profiles

116

were subjected to REMc and GO term analysis to characterize phenomic modules with

Materials and Methods:

121

Strains, media and drugs

122

We obtained the yeast gene knockout strain library (YKO) from Research

123

Genetics (Huntsville, AL, USA) and the knockdown (KD) collection, also referred to as

124

the Decreased Abundance of mRNA Production (DAmP) library, from Open Biosystems

125

(Huntsville, AL, USA). The YKO library is in the genetic background of BY4741 (S288C

126

MATa ura3-∆0 his3-∆1 leu2-∆0 met17-∆0). Additional information and strains can be

127

obtained at https://dharmacon.horizondiscovery.com/cdnas-and-orfs/non-mammalian-

128

cdnas-and-orfs/yeast/#all. Some mutants appear multiple times in the library and they

129

are treated independently in our analysis. HLD is a modified synthetic complete medium

130

[8] and was used with 2% dextrose (HLD) as the carbon source. Doxycycline

131

hydrochloride (BP26535) was obtained from Fisher Scientific. Gemcitabine (Gemzar)

132

was obtained from Eli Lilly and Company (0002-7502-01). Cytarabine was obtained from

133

Bedford Laboratories (55390-131-10).

134

A tet-inducible dCK query allele was constructed in the SGA background in the

135

following way: An integrating plasmid for doxycycline-inducible gene expression was

136

constructed by subcloning 3’UTR and 5’ORF targeting sequences from the LYP1 locus

137

into pJH023 [34], creating pJH023_UO_lyp1, and the reverse VP16 transactivator (Tet-

138

ON), obtained by PCR from pCM176 [35], was fused to the ACT1 promoter by overlap

139

PCR and subcloned into pJH023_UO_lyp1, replacing the VP16 transactivator (Tet-OFF)

140

and creating the “Tet-ON” construct, pML1055 [36]. pML1055 was digested with NOT1

141

and transformed into strain 15578-1.2b_LYP1 (MAT his3∆1 leu2∆0 ura3∆0

142

can1∆0::PGAL1-TADH1-PMFA1-his5+sp hmr∆0::URA3ca), which was derived by backcrossing

143

145

pML1055 between the promoter and ORF at the LYP1 locus was selected with

146

nourseothricin, giving rise to yDW1 (MAT his3∆1 leu2∆0 ura3∆0 can1∆0::PGAL1-TADH1-

147

PMFA1-his5+sp hmr∆0::URA3ca Pact1-revTetR-VP16-natMX-PtetO7-LYP1). Tet-inducible

148

LYP1 in yDW1 was verified phenotypically by doxycycline-dependent SAEC sensitivity

149

[36]. Overlap PCR was performed to fuse deoxycytidine kinase (from a plasmid, gift of

150

Bo Xu and William Parker, Southern Research) and the HPH gene (from pFA6a-HBH-

151

hphMX4) [37], introducing flanking sequences for replacement of the LYP1 ORF (see

152

Additional File 1, Table S1 for primers). The PCR product was transformed into yDW1

153

(Additional File 2, Fig. S1) and transformants selected on hygromycin were confirmed

154

by doxycycline-induced sensitivity to gemcitabine and cytarabine, yielding yMI16.

155

The synthetic genetic array (SGA) method, a way to introduce an allele of

156

interest into the YKO/KD library and recover haploid double mutants [28,29], was used to

157

derive a haploid YKO/KD collection with doxycycline-inducible dCK expression.

159
160

Quantitative high throughput cell array phenotyping (Q-HTCP)
Q-HTCP, an automated method of collecting growth curve phenotypes for the

161

YKO/KD library arrayed onto agar media, was used to obtain phenomic data [38]. A

162

Caliper Sciclone 3000 liquid handling robot was used for cell array printing, integrated

163

with a custom imaging robot (Hartman laboratory) and Cytomat 6001 (Thermo Fisher

164

Scientific, Asheville, NC, USA) incubator. Images of the 384-culture arrays were

165

obtained approximately every 2-3 hours and analyzed as previously described [9,38]. To

166

obtain CPPs, image analysis was performed in Matlab and data were fit to the logistic

167

equation, G(t) = K/(1 + e−r(t−l)), assuming G(0) < K, where G(t) is the image intensity of a

168

spotted culture vs. time, K is the carrying capacity, r is the maximum specific growth

169

rate, and l is the moment of maximal absolute growth rate, occurring when G(t) = K/2

170

(the time to reach half of carrying capacity) [7]. The CPPs, primarily K and L, were used

171

as phenotypes to measure drug-gene interaction.

172
173
174

Quantification of drug-gene interaction
Gene interaction was defined by departure of the corresponding YKO/KD strain

175

from its expected phenotypic response to gemcitabine or cytarabine. The expected

176

phenotype was determined by cell proliferation phenotypes of the mutant without

177

gemcitabine or cytarabine, and with 5ug/mL doxycycline, together with those of the

178

reference strain with and without gemcitabine or cytarabine [5,6,9,34]. The concentrations

179

of gemcitabine or cytarabine (ug/mL) were chosen based on phenotypic responses

180

being functionally discriminating in the parental strain. Gemcitabine, cytarabine, or

181

doxycycline, alone, did not alter cell proliferation (Fig. 2C-F; Additional File 2, Fig.

182

S2A-D).

183

Interaction scores were calculated as previously described [9,39], with slight

184

modifications, as summarized below. All media conditions used for interaction score

185

calculation had 5 ug/mL doxycycline to express dCK. Variables were defined as:

186

Di = concentration (dose) of gemcitabine or cytarabine

187

Ri = observed mean growth parameter for parental Reference strain at Di

188

Yi = observed growth parameter for the YKO/KD mutant strain at Di

189

Ki = Yi – Ri, the difference in growth parameter between the YKO/KD mutant (Y i) and

190

Reference (Ri) at Di

191

K0 = Y0 - R0, the effect of gene KO/KD on the observed phenotype in the absence of

192

gemcitabine or cytarabine; this value is annotated as ‘shift’ and is subtracted from all K i

193

to obtain Li

194

Li = Ki - K0, the interaction between (specific influence of) the KO/KD mutation on

195

gemcitabine or cytarabine response, at Di

196

For cultures not generating a growth curve, Yi = 0 for K and r, and the L

197

parameter was assigned Yi max, defined as the maximum observed Yi among all

198

cultures exhibiting a minimum carrying capacity (K) within 2 standard deviation (SD) of

199

the parental reference strain mean at Di. Yi max was also assigned to outlier values (i.e.,

200

if Yi > Yi max).

201

Interaction was calculated by the following steps:

202

1) Compute the average value of the 768 reference cultures (Ri) at each dose (Di):

203

2) Assign Yi max (defined above) if growth curve is observed at D0, but not at Di, or if

204

observed Yi is greater than Yi max.

205

3) Calculate Ki = Yi - Ri.

206

4) Calculate Li = Ki – K0

207

5) Fit data by linear regression (least squares): Li = A + B*Di

208

6) Compute the interaction value ‘INT’ at the max dose: INT = Li-max = A + B*Dmax

209

7) Calculate the mean and standard deviation of interaction scores for reference strains,

210

mean(REFINT) and SD(REFINT); mean(REFINT) is expected to be approximately zero, with

211

SD(REFINT) primarily useful for standardizing against variance (Additional File 1,

212

Tables S2-S5; Additional Files 3-4).

213

8) Calculate interaction z-scores:

214

z-score(YKOINT) = (YKOINT – mean(REFINT ))/SD(REFINT)

215

z-score(YKOINT) > 2 for L or < -2 for K are referred to as gene deletion enhancers

216

of gemcitabine or cytarabine cytotoxicity, and conversely, L interaction score < -2 or K

217

interaction scores >2 are considered gene deletion suppressors. Because the CPP

218

distributions for KD strains were different from the reference strain, we used the mean

219

and standard deviation from the KD plates only as a conservative measure of variance

220

where z-score(KDINT) = (KDINT – mean(KDINT ))/SD(KDINT).

223

Recursive expectation-maximization clustering (REMc) and heatmap generation
REMc is a probability-based clustering method and was performed as previously

224

described [40]. Clusters obtained by Weka 3.5, an EM-optimized Gaussian mixture-

225

clustering module, were subjected to hierarchical clustering in R (http://www.r-

226

project.org/) to further aid visualization with heatmaps. REMc was performed using L

227

and K interaction z-scores (Fig. 3A). The effect of gene deletion on the CPP (in the

228

absence of drug), termed ‘shift’ (K0), was not used for REMc, but was included for

229

visualization in the final hierarchical clustering. Additional File 5, Files A-B contain

230

REMc results in text files with associated data also displayed as heatmaps. In cases

231

where a culture did not grow in the absence of drug, 0.0001 was assigned as the

232

interaction score, so that associated data (‘NA’) could be easily indicated by red coloring

233

in the shift columns of the heatmaps.

234
235
236

Gene ontology term finder (GTF)
A python script was used to format REMc clusters for analysis with the command

237

line version of the GO Term Finder (GTF) tool downloaded from

238

http://search.cpan.org/dist/GO-TermFinder/ [41]. GTF reports on enrichment of Gene

239

Ontology (GO) terms by comparing the ratio of genes assigned to a term within a cluster

240

to the respective ratio involving all genes tested. Additional File 5, File C contains GTF

241

analysis of all REMc clusters. GO-enriched terms from REMc were investigated with

242

respect to genes representing the term and literature underlying their annotations [42].

245

Gene ontology term averaging (GTA) analysis
In addition to using GTF to survey functional enrichment in REMc clusters, we

246

developed GTA as a complementary workflow, using the GO information on SGD at

1. Calculate the average and SD for interaction values of all genes in a GO term.

249

2. Filter results to obtain terms having GTA value greater than 2 or less than -2.

3. Obtain GTA scores defined as |GTA value| - gtaSD; filter for GTA score > 2.

258

PharmacoDB holds pharmacogenomics data from cancer cell lines, including

259

transcriptomics and drug sensitivity [33]. The PharmacoGx R/Bioconductor package [43]

260

was used to analyze the GDSC1000 (https://pharmacodb.pmgenomics.ca/datasets/5)

261

and gCSI (https://pharmacodb.pmgenomics.ca/datasets/4) datasets, which contained

262

transcriptomic and drug sensitivity results. A p-value < 0.05 was used for differential

263

gene expression and drug sensitivity. For gene expression, the sign of the standardized

264

coefficient denotes increased (+) or decreased (-) expression. The biomaRt R package

265

[44,45] was used with the Ensembl database [46] to match yeast and human homologs

266

from the phenomic and transcriptomic data, classifying yeast-human homology as one to

267

one, one to many, and many to many. The Princeton Protein Orthology Database

268

(PPOD) was also used to manually review and further consider homology [47].

demonstrated for the reference strain (Fig. 2A-F), as the two nucleosides exerted

279

cytotoxicity only if dCK was induced by the addition of doxycycline. Induction of dCK had

280

no effect on proliferation in the absence of gemcitabine or cytarabine (Fig. 2C-F).

281

Interaction scores were calculated by departure of the observed CPP for each

282

YKO/KD strain from that expected based on the observed phenotypes for the reference

283

strain treated and untreated with drug and the YKO/KD strain in the absence of drug,

284

incorporating multiple drug concentrations, 768 replicate reference strain control

285

cultures, and summarized by linear regression as z-scores [6-8,30,34,38]. Gene

286

interaction scores with absolute value greater than two were selected for global analysis

287

and termed deletion enhancers (z-score_L ≥ 2 or z-score_K ≤ -2) or deletion

288

suppressors (z-score_L ≤ -2 or z-score_K ≥ 2) of drug cytotoxicity, revealing functions

289

that buffer or promote drug cytotoxicity, respectively [39] (Fig. 2).

305

Growth inhibition was greater for gemcitabine than for cytarabine (Fig. 2A-F),

306

however, the phenotypic variance was also less for cytarabine, such that interactions of

307

smaller effect size were detectable and the range of scores was greater (Additional File

308

1, Table S6). The CPP, ‘L’, (the time at which half carrying capacity is reached), is most

309

sensitive to growth inhibitory perturbation, while ‘K’ (carrying capacity) reports on more

310

extreme growth differences (Fig. 2A-H). Low correlation between the gene-drug

311

interaction profiles suggested differential buffering of these two drugs, consistent with

312

their distinct anti-tumor efficacies (Fig. 2I-J).

313
314
315

Functional analysis of gene-interaction modules
Recursive expectation-maximization clustering (REMc) was used to identify

316

modules of genes that shared similar profiles of buffering or promoting nucleoside

317

toxicity of gemcitabine or cytarabine [40] (see Fig. 3A-F; Table 1; Additional File 5). As

318

described previously, REMc results were assessed with GO Term Finder for Gene

319

Ontology functional enrichment [41] and heatmaps generated by first adding data

320

regarding the main effect of the gene knockout or knockdown (i.e., no drug) on cell

321

proliferation, termed ‘shift’ (see methods), followed by hierarchical clustering [40,41]. GO

322

Term Average (GTA) scores, which are based on the average and standard deviation of

323

drug-gene interaction for all genes of each GO term [39], were used as a complement to

324

REMc/GTF for identifying functions that buffer or promote drug effects (Table 2, Fig. 4,

325

and Additional File 6, Files A-C). Yeast-human homologs were judged, regarding

326

causality of differential gene expression associated with sensitivity to gemcitabine or

327

cytarabine, by the correspondence of yeast phenomic and cancer pharmacogenomics

328

results, thus establishing a model resource to test the utility of yeast phenomics to inform

329

cancer genetic profiling for predicting drug-specific, anti-tumor efficacy (Fig. 3G-H).

366

Heatmaps were also produced systematically to visualize drug-gene interaction profiles

367

for all genes assigned to GO terms identified by REMc/GTF or GTA; these are referred

368

to as term-specific heatmaps, and are grouped by GO term parent-child relationships

369

(Additional File 7).

370

Cancer pharmacogenomics data in PharmacoDB were mined using PharmacoGx

371

[43] and biomaRt [44,45] with the GDSC1000 [31,49] or gCSI [32,50] datasets to match

372

yeast drug-gene interaction by homology to differential gene expression in gemcitabine

373

or cytarabine sensitive cancer cell lines (Fig. 3G-H; Additional File 8). Yeast gene

374

deletion enhancers identified human homologs underexpressed in gemcitabine or

375

cytarabine sensitive cells, termed UES, while yeast gene deletion suppressors identified

376

human homologs overexpressed in drug sensitive cells, termed OES (Fig. 3G).

377

The analysis was focused on the GDSC database, because it had expression

378

data available for both gemcitabine and cytarabine; however, analysis of the gCSI data

379

was also conducted for gemcitabine (Additional File 8, File A). Differential expression

380

was analyzed: (1) across all tissue types, to consider interactions that might be

381

applicable in novel treatment settings; (2) in hematopoietic & lymphoid tissue; and (3) in

382

lung tissue, as cytarabine and gemcitabine are used to treat HaL and lung cancers,

383

respectively. Gemcitabine is also used for pancreatic cancer; however, the number of

384

cell lines tested (30) was lower than for lung (156) or HaL (152). Thus, yeast genes that

385

were deletion enhancing or suppressing were catalogued with human homologs that

386

were UES or OES in PharmacoDB (Figs. 3G-H, Tables 3-5, and Additional File 8).

387

In summary REMc, GTF, and GTA revealed functional genetic modules that

388

alternatively buffer (deletion enhancing) or promote (deletion suppressing) drug

389

cytotoxicity [5,40,51], and illustrated whether the effects were shared or differential

390

between gemcitabine and cytarabine (Fig. 4). Yeast phenomic information was

391

integrated with pharmacogenomics data results according to yeast-human gene

392

393

sensitivity in cancer cell lines (Figs. 5-7). This approach serves to generate hypotheses

394

regarding whether differential expression of a particular gene is causal for increased

395

drug sensitivity [52], and ultimately whether yeast phenomic models can improve the

396

predictive value of cancer pharmacogenomics data in the context of precision oncology

397

[53-58].

Functions that respond to gemcitabine and cytarabine similarly

Genetic modules that buffer cytotoxicity of both gemcitabine and cytarabine

401

To characterize gemcitabine and cytarabine, which have similar molecular

402

structures and mechanisms of action, yet different spectra of anti-tumor efficacy, we first

403

surveyed for buffering genes shared in common. Examples of genes with deletion

404

enhancing interactions for both drugs are displayed in clusters 2-0.2-0, 1-0-14, 2-0.2-2

405

and 2-0.16-1 (Fig. 3B). GO enrichment was observed in these clusters for the DNA

406

integrity checkpoint, positive regulation of DNA replication, and the Mre11, RecQ

407

helicase-Topo III, CORVET, HOPS, GET, and Ubp3-Bre5 deubiquitination complexes

408

(Fig. 4, Table 1). GTA identified many of the same functions and additionally revealed

409

the terms vesicle fusion with vacuole and checkpoint clamp complex (Table 2). We

410

mapped yeast gene-drug interactions to respective human homologs in PharmacoDB to

411

find evidence for evolutionary conservation of gene-drug interaction (Fig. 5C-D,

412

Additional File 8, Files B-D) and buffering mechanisms.

DNA integrity checkpoint and repair-related complexes
As gemcitabine and cytarabine triphosphate analogs are incorporated into DNA,

425

we anticipated shared interactions with genes functioning in DNA metabolism and repair.

426

Overlap was observed, however there were differential effects between genes assigned

427

to the same gene ontology terms, such that GO TermFinder enrichment in REMc

428

clusters was less than might have been expected. For example, deletion enhancing

429

gene-drug interaction for the GO term, DNA integrity checkpoint, was enriched in cluster

430

1-0-14, which displayed deletion enhancement for both gemcitabine and cytarabine

431

(Table 1, Figs. 3 and Fig. 5A). However, its child term, intra-S DNA damage

432

checkpoint, was not GO-enriched because of differential clustering among drug-gene

433

interactions associated with the term (Additional File 5, File C). Similarly, intra-S DNA

434

damage checkpoint was not identified by GTA due to variation in interaction between

435

genes assigned to the term, highlighting the utility in displaying the phenomic data for

Enriched complexes functionally related to the DNA integrity checkpoint function

443

while TOP3 had a similar, but slightly weaker interaction pattern in cluster 1-0-16

transcription elongation, and deletion of RECQL5 increases cancer susceptibility [75,76].

470

Human TOP3A was also UES for cytarabine in lung tissue (Fig 5C; 2-0.16-1). TOP3A is

471

underexpressed in ovarian cancer, and mutations in TOP3A are associated with

472

increased risk for acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, suggesting

473

potential cancer vulnerabilities if somatic, but can also occur in the germline, which

474

would lead to enhanced host toxicity [90-92].

475

The checkpoint clamp in yeast is comprised of Rad17/hRad1, Ddc1, and Mec3,

476

which function downstream of Rad24/hRad17 in the DNA damage checkpoint pathway

477

[70-72] to recruit yDpb11/hTopB1 to stalled replication forks and activate the

478

yMec1/hATR protein kinase activity, initiating the DNA damage response [73]. The

479

human homolog of yeast RAD24, RAD17, was UES for gemcitabine in both lung and

480

hematopoietic & lymphoid tissue (Fig. 5C; 1-0-14), representing a synthetic lethal

481

relationship of potential therapeutic relevance. Consistent with this finding in yeast,

482

depletion of hRAD17 can sensitize pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine [74].

483

Mre11, Xrs2, and Rad50 constitute the Mre11 complex, which participates in the

484

formation and processing of double-strand DNA breaks involved in recombination and

485

repair [126], and clustered together in 1-0-14 (Figs. 5B-C). Deficiency in the Mre1

486

complex is known to sensitize human cells to nucleoside analog toxicity [127], as also

487

seen in cancer cell lines deficient for other checkpoint-signaling genes, such as Rad9,

488

Chk1, or ATR, [128]. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in DNA damage response (ATM

489

and CHEK1) have been associated with overall survival in pancreatic cancer patients

490

treated with gemcitabine and radiation therapy [129]. Taken together, the results highlight

491

evolutionarily conserved genes that function in DNA replication and recombination-

492

based repair and are required to buffer the cytotoxic effects of both cytarabine and

493

gemcitabine.

495
496

Positive regulation of DNA-dependent DNA replication initiation
The term, positive regulation of DNA-dependent DNA replication initiation, was

497

identified by REMc/GTF and GTA for buffering interactions with both drugs, though

498

stronger for gemcitabine (Tables 1 and 2). Genes representing this term were FKH2,

499

RFM1, and SUM1 (Fig. 5B). The origin binding protein, Sum1, is required for efficient

500

replication initiation [130] and forms a complex with Rfm1 and the histone deacetylase,

501

Hst1, which is recruited to replication origins to deacetylate H4K5 for initiation [131].

502

HST1 was also a strong deletion enhancer but was observed only for the L parameter

503

and clustered in 2-0.2-2. The forkhead box proteins, Fkh1 and Fkh2, contribute to proper

504

replication origin timing and long range clustering of origins in G1 phase [132], and

505

appear to buffer the cytotoxicity of gemcitabine more so than cytarabine, with FKH2

506

deletion showing a stronger effect than its paralog (Fig. 5B). Multiple human forkhead

507

box protein homologs (yFKH2/hFOXJ1/FOXG1/FOXJ3/FOXH1) (Fig. 6D) were

508

observed as UES in PharmacoDB, of which FOXJ1 underexpression is a marker of poor

509

prognosis in gastric cancer [133], reduced expression of FOXG1 is correlated with worse

510

prognosis in breast cancer [134], FOXJ3 is inhibited by miR-517a and associated with

511

lung and colorectal cancer cell proliferation and invasion [135,136], and FOXH1 is

512

overexpressed in breast cancer, and FOXH1 inhibition reduces proliferation in breast

513

cancer cell lines [137]. Although not UES in PharmacoDB, inhibition of the HST1

514

homolog, SIRT1, by Tenovin-6 inhibits the growth of acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells

515

and enhances cytarabine cytotoxicity [138], enhances gemcitabine efficacy in pancreatic

516

cancer cell lines, and improves survival in a pancreatic cancer mouse model [139]. Thus,

517

loss of this gene module that positively regulates DNA replication initiation appears to be

518

robustly involved in oncogenesis and is also synthetic lethal with gemcitabine and

519

cytarabine.

521
522

Endosomal transport and related processes
GO annotated processes, enriched by REMc/GTF and GTA and having deletion

523

enhancement profiles, related to endosome transport included vesicle fusion with

524

vacuole (VAM3 and VPS33), the CORVET/HOPS (VPS41, VPS8, VPS16, PEP3,

525

VPS33, VAM6, and VPS3), ESCRT (VPS27, VPS24, DID4, MVB12; HSE1 and SRN2

526

were gemcitabine specific), GET complex (GET1, GET2; 2-0.14-0), and Ubp3-Bre5

527

deubiquitination (UBP3 and BRE5) complexes (Tables 1-2, Fig. 5E). The CORVET and

528

HOPS tethering complexes function in protein and lipid transport between endosomes

529

and lysosomes/vacuoles, are required for vacuolar fusion, recognize SNARE complexes,

530

help determine endomembrane identity, and interact with the ESCRT complex [140,141].

531

The ESCRT complex recognizes ubiquitinated endosomal proteins to mediate

532

degradation through the multivesicular body pathway [142,143]. The Ubp3-Bre5

533

deubiquitination complex maintains Sec23, a subunit of COPII vesicles required for

534

transport between the ER and Golgi, by cleaving its ubiquitinated form [144]. The GET

535

complex (GET1-3) mediates insertion of tail-anchored proteins into the ER membrane, a

536

critical process within the secretory pathway for vesicular trafficking [145-147]. Thus,

537

these complexes, which function in processes related to endosomal transport, appear to

538

be critical for buffering the toxicity of nucleoside analogs.

539

Several deletion enhancing, endosomal genes had human homologs associated

540

with UES in cancer cell lines and/or reported roles in cancer biology (Figs. 5E, 6D),

541

including: (1) VPS41/VPS41, in which a single nucleotide polymorphism is associated

542

with familial melanoma [148]; (2) VPS27/WDFY1, which is regulated by NPR2 to

543

maintain the metastatic phenotype of cancer cells [149,150]; (3) human homologs of

544

yeast HSE1, TOM1 and TOM1L2, TOM1L2 hypomorphic mice having increased tumor

545

incidence associated with alterations in endosomal trafficking [151]; (4) VPS8/VPS8 and

546

VAM6/VPS39, which are predicted to be homologous members of the CORVET complex

547

[152]; and (5) VPS21/RAB21/RAB22A, where RAB21 promotes carcinoma-associated

548

fibroblast invasion and knockdown inhibits glioma cell proliferation [93,94], and RAB22A

549

promotes oncogenesis in lung, breast, and ovarian cancer [95-97]. Thus, it seems tumors

550

arising in the context of deficiencies in certain endosomal trafficking genes could be

551

vulnerable to gemcitabine and/or cytarabine.

552
553

‘Non-GO-enriched’ homolog pairs with corresponding UES and deletion enhancement

554

We next explored yeast-human homologs exhibiting yeast deletion enhancement

555

and underexpression sensitivity in cancer, systematically and regardless of whether their

556

functions were enriched within Gene Ontology (Table 3, Fig. 5C). ‘Non-enriched’

557

interaction can be explained by a small total number of genes performing the function,

558

only select genes annotated to a term impacting the phenotype, by genes contributing to

559

a function without yet being annotated to it, by novel functions, and other possibilities.

560

With regard to the above, human homologs of the yeast type 2C protein

561

phosphatase, PTC1, included PPM1L and PPM1E (Fig. 5C; 1-0-14). PPM1L has

562

reduced expression in familial adenomatous polyposis [69], while PPM1E upregulation

563

has been associated with cell proliferation in gastric cancer [68]. Such differential

564

interactions of paralogs could result from tissue specific expression and functional

565

differentiation of regulatory proteins. Previously, we reported ptc1-∆0 to buffer

566

transcriptional repression of RNR1 [34], which is upregulated as part of the DNA damage

567

response to increase dNTP pools [153].

568

The microtubule binding proteins, yBIM1/hMAPRE2/hMAPRE3, were deletion

569

enhancing in yeast and UES in cancer for gemcitabine (Fig. 5C; 1-0-14), of which

570

frameshift mutations were reported in MAPRE3 for gastric and colorectal cancers [81],

571

however, MAPRE2 is upregulated in invasive pancreatic cancer cells [80], demonstrating

572

that the yeast phenomic model could help distinguish causal influence in cases of

573

paralogous gene expression having what appear to be opposing effects on phenotypic

574

response of cancer cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy.

575

NAM7 is a yeast RNA helicase that was deletion enhancing for both drugs,

576

though slightly stronger for cytarabine, while its human homologs HELZ, HELZ2, and

577

UPF1, were UES only with cytarabine (Fig. 5C; 1-0-14). HELZ has differential influence

578

in cancer, acting as a tumor suppressor or oncogene [61-64]. UPF1 downregulation is

579

associated with poor prognosis in gastric cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, and

580

mutations often occur in pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma [65-67]. Thus, it is

581

possible cytarabine could have efficacy for patients with mutational loss of function in

582

members of this helicase family.

583

ASF1/ASF1B (Fig. 5C; 2-0.16-1) functions in nucleosome assembly as an anti-

584

silencing factor, and is one of the most overexpressed histone chaperones in cancer

585

[82]. The yeast phenomic data suggest that anti-cancer approaches that target ASF1 as

586

a driver [154] could be augmented by combination with gemcitabine or cytarabine.

587

AVL9/AVL9 (Fig. 5C; 2-0.16-1) functions in exocytic transport from the Golgi [83].

588

AVL9 knockdown resulted in abnormal mitoses associated with defective protein

589

trafficking, and increased cell migration with development of cysts [84], but also reduced

590

cell proliferation and migration in other studies [85]. Regardless, the yeast phenomic

591

model together with pharmacogenomics data would predict that functional loss of AVL9

592

renders cells vulnerable to cytarabine.

PMR1 is a P-type ATPase that transports Mn++ and Ca++ into the Golgi. Several

594

of its human homologs ATP1A1, ATP1A2, ATP1A3, ATP1A4, ATP2C1 were UES, either

595

for gemcitabine or cytarabine, in the PharmacoDB analysis (Fig. 5C; 2-0.16-1). Reduced

596

expression of ATP1A1 can promote development of renal cell carcinoma [86], reduced

597

expression of ATP1A2 is associated with breast cancer [87], and mutations in ATP2C1

598

impair the DNA damage response, and increase the incidence of squamous cell tumors

599

in mice [88,89]. Like with FKH2 (described above), PMR1 deletion enhancement points

600

to multiple human homologs that are both implicated in the cancer literature to promote

601

cancer when underexpressed, yet are also UES in the pharmacogenomics data,

602

suggesting a potentially clinically useful synthetic lethal vulnerability.

603

KTI11/DPH3 (Fig. 5C; 1-0-14), is a multi-functional protein involved in the

604

biosynthesis of dipthamide and tRNA modifications important for regulation of

605

translation, development and stress response [77,78], and has promoter mutations

606

associated with skin cancer [79]. It was observed to be UES only for cytarabine and in

607

hematopoietic and lymphoid cancer (the context cytarabine is used clinically).

608

ACB1 binds acyl-CoA esters and transports them to acyl-CoA-consuming

609

processes, which is upregulated in response to DNA replication stress [155]. Human

610

homologs of ACB1 exhibiting UES (Fig. 5C; 2-0.16-1) included: (1) DBI, which is

611

upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma and lung cancer, and its expression is

612

negatively associated with multidrug resistance in breast cancer [101-103]; (2) ACBD4,

613

which promotes ER-peroxisome associations [98] and is upregulated by a histone

614

deacetylase inhibitor, valproic acid, in a panel of cancer cell lines [99]; and (3) ACBD5,

615

which also promotes ER-peroxisome associations, but its link to cancer is unclear [100]..

616

Thus, it appears this gene family may influence epigenetic processes that buffer the

617

cytotoxic effects of gemcitabine and cytarabine.

620

Deletion suppression of toxicity for both nucleosides
As opposed to deletion enhancing interactions, which represent functions that

621

buffer the cytotoxic effects of the drugs, deletion suppression identifies genes that

622

promote toxicity, thus predicting overexpression sensitivity (OES) in pharmacogenomics

623

data that represent causal tumor vulnerabilities. REMc/GTF identified as deletion

THO (2-0.8-1), RNA cap binding (1-0-3), and the NuA3b histone acetyltransferase

626

complexes (1-0-7) (Additional File 5, File C), while GTA identified mitochondrial

627

translational elongation and the nuclear cap binding complex (Additional File 6, File A).

628

However, the respective term-specific heatmaps revealed weak effects and high shift for

629

many of the genes (Additional File 2, Fig. S3), highlighting the utility of this phenomic

630

visualization tool for prioritizing findings, and leading us to shift our focus to individual

631

yeast-human homologs identified in gene deletion suppressing clusters that were OES in

632

the pharmacogenomics analysis, as detailed below.

633

In cluster 2-0.8-1, yeast-human homologs with correlated gene deletion

634

suppression and OES for both gemcitabine and cytarabine (Fig. 5D; Table 3) included:

635

(1) YTA7/ATAD2/ATAD2B, which localizes to chromatin and regulates histone gene

636

expression. ATAD2 overexpression portends poor prognosis in gastric, colorectal,

637

cervical, hepatocellular carcinoma, lung, and breast cancer, and thus overexpression

638

sensitivity could represent the potential to target a driver gene [119-125]; (2) PIF1/PIF1, a

639

DNA helicase, which is involved in telomere regulation and is required during oncogenic

640

stress [113]; (3) RPS1B/RPS3A, which is a small subunit ribosomal protein that is

641

overexpressed in hepatitis B associated hepatocellular carcinoma and non-small cell

642

lung cancer [114,115]; (4) LEO1/LEO1, which associates with the RNA polymerase II and

643

acts as an oncogene in acute myelogenous leukemia [156]; (5) ELO3/ELOVL1/ELOVL2/

644

ELOVL4/ELOVL6, which constitutes a family of fatty acid elongases that function in

645

sphingolipid biosynthesis, among which ELOVL1 is overexpressed in breast and

646

colorectal cancer tissue [107,108], ELOVL2 is upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma

647

[109], and ELOVL6 is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis in liver and

648

breast cancer [110,111]; (6) MDL2/ABCB10, which is a mitochondrial inner membrane

649

ATP-binding cassette protein and is upregulated in breast cancer [112]; (7) CPR3/PPIA,

650

which is a mitochondrial cyclophilin that is upregulated in lung cancer, esophageal, and

651

pancreatic cancer [104-106]; and (8) SAC3/MCM3AP/SAC3D1, which is a nuclear pore-

652

associated protein functioning in transcription and mRNA export, with MCM3AP being

653

upregulated in glioma cells [116], while SAC3D1 is upregulated in cervical cancer and

654

hepatocellular carcinoma [117,118]. Yeast gene deletion suppression together with

655

overexpression sensitivity of human homologs in cancer reveals potential therapeutic

656

vulnerabilities that can be further explored in both systems.

658

Gemcitabine-specific gene interaction modules

659

Gemcitabine-specific gene deletion enhancement

660

Gemcitabine-specific deletion enhancement indicates genes for which loss of

661

function increases vulnerability to gemcitabine to a greater extent than cytarabine.

662

Therefore, these genes provide insight into cytotoxic mechanisms that are unique

663

between the two deoxycytidine analogs. Representative clusters were GO-enriched for

664

intralumenal vesicle formation (1-0-10), peptidyl-tyrosine dephosphorylation (1-0-0), and

665

the Set1C/COMPASS and HDA1 complexes (Fig. 3C, Fig. 6A-C, Table 1). GTA

666

identified negative regulation of macroautophagy, protein urmylation, and the RAVE,

667

GATOR (Iml1), and Elongator holoenzyme complexes (Fig. 6A, Table 2).

668

Pharmacogenomics integration is highlighted for clusters 2-0.2-1, 1-0-10, and 1-0-0 (Fig.

669

6D; see also, Additional File 8). Taken together, the results suggest that autophagy-

670

related processes and perhaps others less well characterized by GO buffer cytotoxicity

671

of gemcitabine to a greater extent than cytarabine.

Autophagy related processes
Autophagy-related processes and complexes consisted of intralumenal vesicle

693

formation (1-0-0; BRO1, DOA4, DID4, VPS24, VPS4), the GATOR/SEACIT/Iml1

694

complex (NPR2, NPR3), autophagosome maturation (VAM3, CCZ1), negative regulation

695

of macroautophagy (PHO85, PCL5, KSP1, SIC1, PHO80), and the RAVE complex

696

(RAV1, RAV2) (Fig. 6A).

697

Of the autophagy-related complexes, Npr2 and Npr3 form an evolutionarily

698

conserved heterodimer involved in mediating induction of autophagy by inhibition of

699

TORC1 signaling in response to amino acid starvation [216], and also promoting non-

700

nitrogen starvation induced autophagy [217] (Fig. 6A). The RAVE complex (RAV1/2)

701

promotes assembly of the vacuolar ATPase [218,219], which is required for vacuolar

702

acidification and efficient autophagy [220]. Gene deletion strains in the term negative

regulation of macroautophagy (PHO85, PHO80, and SIC1) [221], which seemed from the

704

automated assessment to suggest an opposing effect, were less compelling following

705

detailed visualization of the data, due to the associated high shift and cytarabine deletion

706

enhancing interaction (Fig. 6A).

707

Regarding the term intralumenal vesicle formation, Vps24 and Did4 are

708

components of the ESCRT-III complex (see Figs. 5E and 6A), which functions at

709

endosomes, and the ATPase Vps4 is required for disassembly of the complex [222].

710

Doa4 interacts with Vps20 of ESCRT-III to promote intralumenal vesicle formation, which

711

also requires BRO1 [223]. Pharmacogenomics correlation revealed UES in cancer cell

712

lines for DID4/CHMP2A/CHMP2B (Fig. 6D; 1-0-10). During autophagy, CHMP2A

713

translocates to the phagophore to regulate separation of the inner and outer

714

autophagosomal membranes to form double-membrane autophagosomes [171].

715

CHMP2B is a member of the ESCRT-III complex required for efficient autophagy and

716

has reduced expression in melanoma [172,173], raising the hypothesis that gemcitabine

717

could have efficacy in that context.

718

Other genes involved in autophagy-related processes that had human homologs

719

UES in cancer cell lines included: (1) PEP12/STX12 (Fig. 6D; 1-0-10), a t-SNARE

720

required for mitophagy [180], for which underexpression is associated with risk of

721

recurrence [181]; and (2) VPS30/BECN1, knockdown of which enhances gemcitabine

722

cytotoxicity in pancreatic cancer stem cells [170]. Furthermore, gemcitabine treatment

723

has been found to upregulate autophagy in pancreatic or breast cancer, which buffers

724

drug cytotoxicity as inferred by the combination of gemcitabine with autophagy inhibitors

725

increased killing of cancer cells [224-226]. Thus, autophagy-related findings from the

726

yeast model appear consistent with and to build upon previous cancer cell models.

727
728
729

Histone modification and chromatin remodeling
GTF/REMc identified the Hda1 and Set1C/COMPASS (1-0-0) complexes as

730

gemcitabine-specific deletion enhancing, which was confirmed by term-specific

731

heatmaps (Fig. 6B). The Set1C complex has been characterized to have a role in cell

732

cycle coordination [227], which may be reflected by greater deletion enhancing

733

interaction for the K than for the L CPP. The Set1C/COMPASS complex catalyzes

734

mono-, di-, and tri- methylation of histone H3K4, which can differentially influence gene

735

transcription depending on the number of methyl groups added [228-231], and was

736

implicated by BRE2, SWD1, SWD3, SDC1, SPP1, and SHG1 (Fig. 6B). The SWD1

737

ortholog, RBBP5, which was UES with gemcitabine in lung tissue (Additional File 8,

738

File C; 1-0-4), is upregulated in self-renewing cancer stem cells in glioblastoma and

739

necessary for their self-renewal, is involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in

740

prostate cancer cells via its role in H3K4 trimethylation, and is upregulated in

741

hepatocellular carcinoma [232-235]. Furthermore, gemcitabine sensitivity of pancreatic

742

cancer cell lines was enhanced by H3K4me3 inhibition with verticillin A [233].

743

Histone deacetylases also influence cell cycle regulation [236], and the three

744

genes that make up the yeast Hda1 deacetylase complex (homologous to mammalian

745

class II Hda1-like proteins [237,238]) were gemcitabine deletion enhancers (Fig. 6B).

746

Similar effects in cancer cells include HDAC6 knockdown in pediatric acute myeloid

747

leukemia cells, which enhances cytarabine-induced apoptosis [158-160] and the use of

748

histone deacetylase inhibitors in combination with gemcitabine, which augments killing of

749

pancreatic cancer cell lines [161-165] and HeLa cells [99].

750
751

Peptidyl-tyrosine dephosphorylation

752

REMc/GTF identified peptidyl-tyrosine dephosphorylation (1-0-0), for which the

753

term specific heatmap (Additional File 7) revealed six genes previously characterized

754

for their requirement in oxidant-induced cell cycle arrest and RNA virus replication

755

[239,240], OCA1-6. Two additional tyrosine phosphatases, YMR1, and PTP1, had similar

756

interaction profiles (Fig. 6C). OCA1-3 deletions enhance growth defects associated with

757

reactive oxygen species or caffeine treatment [239,240], and OCA1-4 and OCA6 are

758

deletion suppressors of the cdc13-1 mutation [241]. Although it does not have a tyrosine

759

phosphatase motif, Oca5 deletion also displayed gemcitabine-specific enhancement,

760

consistent with the other genes annotated to this module (Fig. 6C). However, due to the

761

regulatory nature and limited evolutionary conservation of tyrosine phosphorylation, it is

762

not obvious how to predict functionally homologous genetic modules in cancer cells.

Elongator holoenzyme complex and protein urmylation

767

ELP3, ELP4, and ELP6) (Additional File 2, Fig. S4). Protein urmylation involves the

768

covalent modification of lysine residues with the ubiquitin-related modifier, Urm1 [242].

769

The Elongator holoenzyme complex has function in tRNA wobble position uridine

770

thiolation (Additional File 2, Fig. S4), which occurs using Ure1 as a sulfur carrier [243-

771

245]. The two processes share the ELP2 and ELP6 genes and may be distinct modules

772

buffering gemcitabine cytotoxicity. However, several genes involved in tRNA wobble

773

uridine modification have roles in cancer development and deficiency in this pathway

774

enhances targeted therapy in melanoma [246,247], implicating this module as potentially

775

important for personalized anti-cancer efficacy of gemcitabine.

778

Gemcitabine-buffering by non-GO-enriched yeast-human homologs
Homologs with correlated gemcitabine-specific yeast gene deletion enhancement

779

and cancer cell UES (clusters 2-0.2-1, 1-0-10, and 1-0-0) included the family of

780

nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NDKs) (Fig. 6D; Table 4). A single member of the

781

NDK family, YNK1, exists in yeast, while the human genome encodes several paralogs

782

(NME genes) (Additional File 8, File A). The NDKs transfer the gamma phosphate of

783

ATP to nucleoside diphosphate as the final step of purine and pyrimidine nucleoside and

784

deoxynucleoside triphosphate biosynthesis and salvage [248,249]. Thus, NDK appears to

785

modulate gemcitabine toxicity by differential activity for endogenous substrates vs.

786

nucleoside analog drugs. In yeast, deletion enhancement by YNK1 was selective for

787

gemcitabine, however the effects in cancer cells are potentially more complex due to

788

multiple NDK genes. In PharmacoDB, NME3 and 5 were UES for gemcitabine, while

789

NME4, 6, and 7 were OES for cytarabine, implicating differential specificity of NME

790

genes for natural and/or medicinal nucleosides as well as possibly influences of other

791

kinases, which have, for example, been shown to act on gemcitabine diphosphate [250].

792

NME5 overexpression was previously associated with gemcitabine-resistant cancer, and

793

its knockdown can increase gemcitabine efficacy [182]. Thus, the anti-cancer efficacy of

794

gemcitabine could be influenced by differential expression and activity of NDK isoforms

795

across tissues [251], such that NME gene expression could be predictive of response to

796

nucleoside analogs, or perhaps targeted for synergistic anti-tumor activity.

797

KEX2 is the yeast member of the calcium-dependent proprotein convertase

798

subtilisin/kexin type serine proteases, which functions in the secretory pathway. Four of

799

the seven human homologs of KEX2 were UES in the pharmacogenomics analysis (Fig.

800

6D; 1-0-10), including: (1) PCSK1, which can be downregulated by pancreatic cancer

801

derived exosomes [176], (2) PCSK2, which has reduced expression in lung cancer [177],

802

(3) PCSK5, which is also reduced in lung cancer and, furthermore, when reduced in

803

triple negative breast cancer, leads to loss of the Gdf11 tumor suppressor [177,178], and

804

(4) PCSK7, which has been reported both to have reduced expression in lung cancer

805

and increased expression in gemcitabine resistant cells [177,179]. Thus, loss of this gene

806

family may create cancer-specific vulnerabilities to gemcitabine cytotoxicity.

807

NMA1 and its human homologs NMNAT1, NMNAT2, and NMNAT3 are nicotinic

808

acid mononucleotide adenylyltransferases involved in NAD biosynthesis and

809

homeostasis, which were found to be UES for both gemcitabine and cytarabine (Fig. 6D,

810

1-0-0). Loss of function mutations and underexpression of NMNAT1 are associated with

811

increased rRNA expression and sensitivity to DNA damage in lung cancer cell lines

812

[166], consistent with the hypothesis that they could have deletion enhancing therapeutic

813

benefit in cancers treated with gemcitabine or cytarabine.

814

RAD54 is a DNA-dependent ATPase that stimulates strand exchange in

815

recombinational DNA repair, which is a known vulnerability of cancer [252]. The human

816

homolog of RAD54, ATRX, was UES by PharmacoDB analysis (Fig. 6D, 1-0-0), and loss

817

of ATRX has been associated with improved response to gemcitabine plus radiation

818

therapy in glioma patients with IDH1 mutations [168].

819

SCS2/VAPB is an integral ER membrane protein that was deletion enhancing

820

and UES for gemcitabine (Fig. 6D, 1-0-0). VAPB regulates phospholipid metabolism and

821

interacts with ACBD5 (also described above) to promote ER-peroxisome tethering [100]

822

and promotes proliferation in breast cancer via AKT1 [169].

823

YPT32/RAB2A/RAB2B (Fig. 6D, 1-0-0) is a Rab family GTPase involved in the

824

trans-Golgi exocytic pathway, which accumulates during replication stress in yeast [155].

825

RAB2A overexpression promotes breast cancer stem cell expansion and tumorigenesis

826

[174], and downregulation of RAB2B by miR-448 promotes cell cycle arrest and

827

apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells [175].

828

CLB5, a B-type cyclin, is involved in initiation of DNA replication and G1-S

829

progression, for which promoter hypermethylation of the human homolog, CCNA1, is

830

associated with multiple cancers [157], and which was found to be UES with gemcitabine

831

(Fig. 6D, 1-0-0).

832
833

Gemcitabine-specific gene deletion suppression

834

Representing this class of gene interaction, pharmacogenomics integration is

835

highlighted for clusters 2-0.8-0 and 1-0-7 (Fig. 6E). Although there was limited Gene

836

Ontology enrichment, the term phosphatidylserine biosynthetic process (UME6 and

837

CHO1), and the GARP (VPS51-54), and Lem3p-Dnf1p complexes were identified (Fig.

838

6F, Table 2). Ume6 is involved in both positive and negative regulation of the

839

phosphatidylserine synthase, Cho1 [253,254]. Phosphatidylserine exposure to the

840

plasma membrane is a marker of yeast and mammalian apoptosis [255], the latter of

841

which is induced by gemcitabine [256]. In pancreatic cancer cells, addition of the

842

sphingolipid, sphingomyelin, enhances gemcitabine cytotoxicity through increased

843

apoptosis [256,257]. Moreover, GARP complex deficiency leads to reduction of

844

sphingomyelin [258], and accumulation of sphingolipid intermediates, consistent with the

845

hypothesis that reduced sphingolipid metabolism alleviates gemcitabine-mediated

846

apoptosis. Lem3 complexes with Dnf1 or Dnf2 to form phospholipid flippases at the

847

plasma and early endosome/trans-Golgi network membranes and regulate

848

phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine membrane content [259,260],

849

potentially further influencing the apoptotic response. The Lem3-Dnf1 and Lem3-Dnf2

850

flippases are regulated by the serine/threonine kinase Fpk1 [261], which is also a

851

gemcitabine-specific deletion suppressor (Fig. 6F).

852
853

Correlation of gemcitabine-specific gene deletion suppression with OES in cancer cells

854

Although yeast genes associated with GO-enriched terms from gemcitabine-

855

specific deletion suppression (2-0.8-0 and 1-0-7) did not have human homologs that

856

were OES in GDSC, several homologs of ‘non-GO-enriched’ genes were OES (Fig. 6E;

857

Table 4). These included: (1) YGR054W/EIF2A, a eukaryotic initiation factor orthologous

858

between yeast and human that has been implicated in translation of upstream ORFs as

859

part of tumor initiation [215]. Thus, gemcitabine treatment in the context of EIF2A

860

overexpression may increase efficacy; (2) EFT2/EEF2/EFTUD2 (eukaryotic translation

861

elongation factor 2), which further implicates translational regulation as a gemcitabine-

862

targetable cancer driver. EEF2 is overexpressed in numerous cancer types [198] and

863

EFTUD2 knockdown induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells [199]; (3) RPP2B/RPLP2,

864

a component of the 60S ribosomal subunit stalk that is overexpressed in gynecologic

865

cancer [214], again suggesting dysregulated translation promotes gemcitabine toxicity;

866

(4) RPA49/POLR1E, a component of Pol1 [203-205] that has higher expression in

867

bladder cancer and has been recently proposed as a novel target for anti-cancer therapy

868

[206]; (5) OLA1/OLA1 is a GTPase that is conserved from human to bacteria [200]. It is

869

implicated in regulation of ribosomal translation [201] and has increased expression

870

associated with poorer survival in lung cancer patients [202]. The interactions described

871

above suggest gemcitabine may be more effective in the context of “oncogenic

872

ribosomes” [262]. (6) CKA2, the alpha catalytic subunit of casein kinase 2, has two

873

human homologs, CSNK2A1 and CSNK2A2, which were OES with gemcitabine. They

874

can be upregulated in cancer [186-191] and are considered targets for treatment [193]; (7)

875

CLB2/CCNA2/CCNB1, a B-type cyclin involved in cell cycle progression, of which both

876

CCNA2 and CCNB1 are overexpressed in breast and colorectal cancer [194-197].

877

Moreover, the observation that CLB2 deletion (suppressing effect) opposes that of CLB5

878

(deletion enhancing; see above Fig. 6D, 1-0-0) has been previously described in the

879

context of loss of the S-phase checkpoint [263]; (8) SKY1/SRPK1 (serine-arginine rich

880

serine-threonine kinase), which is overexpressed in glioma, and prostate, breast, and

881

lung cancer [207]; (9) SNC2/VAMP8, which functions in fusion of Golgi-derived vesicles

882

with the plasma membrane and is overexpressed in glioma and breast cancer [208,209];

883

(10) YPT6/RAB34, which functions in fusion of endosome-derived vesicles with the late

884

Golgi and is overexpressed in glioma, breast cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma [211-

885

213]; (11) TOP1/TOP1/TOP1MT, Topoisomerase I, which has increased copy number in

886

pancreatic and bile duct cancer [210]; (12) ALD6, which encodes cytosolic aldehyde

887

dehydrogenase, and was a deletion suppressor for both gemcitabine and cytarabine,

888

having multiple homologs that were OES (ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2, ALDH1B1, and

889

ALDH7A1. ALDH1B1). Overexpression of ALDH genes is observed in colorectal and

890

pancreatic cancer [183,184] and is a prognostic marker of cancer stem cells [185].

Cytarabine-specific gene interaction modules

893

Cytarabine-specific gene deletion enhancement

894

Cytarabine-specific deletion enhancement suggests functions that buffer cytotoxic

895

effects of cytarabine to a greater extent than gemcitabine, potentially informing on

896

differential activities of the drugs. There was no notable GO enrichment by REMc/GTF,

897

but four functions of potential relevance were revealed by GTA (Fig. 7A, Table 2). Two

898

of them, the HIR complex (HIR1-3, HPC2) and sphinganine kinase activity (LCB4, LCB5)

899

were relatively weak, being deletion enhancing only for the L CPP (Fig. 7A). LCB4/5

900

homologs that were UES in PharmacoDB included: (1) CERKL (Additional File 8, Files

901

B-C; 1-0-6), a ceramide kinase like gene that regulates autophagy by stabilizing SIRT1

902

[264], a gene mentioned above for its inhibition being synergistic with cytarabine against

903

acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells [138], and (2) AGK, which is overexpressed in

904

hepatocellular carcinoma, glioma, breast, and cervical squamous cell cancers [265-268].

905

Two stronger interaction modules, evidenced by deletion enhancement for both the K

906

and L CPPs, were protein localization to septin ring (HSL1 and ELM1) and the Sec61

907

translocon complex (SBH1, SBH2, and SEC61) (Fig. 7A, Table 2). In yeast, Hsl1 and

908

Elm1 are annotated as “bud sensors” to recruit Hsl7 to the septin ring at the bud site to

909

degrade the mitotic inhibitor, Swe1 [269]. The HSL1 homologs, BRSK1 and BRSK2,

910

were UES in the cancer data. BRSK1 is mutated in gastric and colorectal carcinoma

911

[270] and its decreased expression is associated with breast cancer [271], but BRSK2 is

912

overexpressed in pancreatic cancer, where it is AKT-activating [272]. PharmacoDB also

913

identified the SEC61 homolog, SEC61A1, which is upregulated in colon adenocarcinoma

914

tissue [273].

Human genes that have deletion enhancing yeast homologs and confer cytarabine UES
We identified human genes that were UES to cytarabine and homologous to

927

yeast genes in REMc clusters (1-0-9 and 2-0.13-0) displaying a pattern of cytarabine-

928

specific deletion enhancement (Fig. 7B; Table 5). Cancer-relevant examples include:

929

(1) Ptm1, which is a protein of unknown function that copurifies with late Golgi vesicles

930

containing the v-SNARE, Tlg2p, but interestingly, its human homologs, TMEM87A and

931

TMEM87B, were UES for cytarabine and identified in a study focused on cytarabine

932

efficacy in acute myelogenous leukemia [281].

933

(2) NAP1/NAP1L3/NAP1L4, which is a nucleosome assembly protein involved in nuclear

934

transport and exchange of histones H2A and H2B and also interacts with Clb2, is

935

phosphorylated by CK2, and has protein abundance that increases in response to DNA

936

replication stress [155]. NAP1L3 is overexpressed in breast cancer [280].

937

(3) CCH1, which is a voltage-gated high-affinity calcium channel with several homologs

938

that were UES, including: CACNA1A, underexpressed in breast, colorectal, esophageal,

939

gastric, and brain cancers; CACNA1B, underexpressed in breast and brain cancers;

940

CACNA1C, underexpressed in brain, bladder, lung, lymphoma, prostate, and renal

941

cancers; CACNA1E, underexpressed in breast, brain, gastric, leukemia, lung, and

942

prostate cancers; and CACNA1F, underexpressed in lymphoma [274];

943

(4) IZH1, a yeast membrane protein involved in zinc ion homeostasis, having a human

944

homolog, PAQR1/ADIPOR1 that encodes the adiponectin receptor protein 1, which is

945

differentially regulated in breast cancers [278,279];

946

(5) FAT1, a yeast fatty acid transporter and very long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase

947

that corresponds to SLC27A2 (very long-chain acyl Co-A synthetase), which is

948

underexpressed in lung cancer [275], and SLC27A3 (long-chain fatty acid transport),

949

which is hypermethylated in melanoma [276];

950

(6) FOL2/GCH1, a GTP-cyclohydrolase that catalyzes the first step in folic acid

951

biosynthesis. Downregulation of GCH1 occurs in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma

952

[277].

Discussion:

955

Informative phenomic models have been developed for multiple human diseases,

956

including cystic fibrosis, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer [30,282-284]. Molecular

957

models include mutations in conserved residues of yeast homologs of a disease gene

958

and introduction of human alleles into yeast. Complementation of gene functions by

959

human homologs, and vice versa, has demonstrated evolutionary conservation of gene

960

functions [285-287]. Like their basic functions, gene interactions are conserved [288,289]

961

and yeast is unique in its capability to address complex genetic interactions

962

experimentally [290]. Here, we model how yeast phenomic assessment of gene-drug

963

interaction could be employed as part of a precision oncology paradigm to predict

964

efficacy of cytotoxic chemotherapy based on the unique cancer genetic profiles of

965

individual patients.

966

To model the networks that buffer deoxyribonucleoside analogs, we humanized

967

yeast by introducing deoxycytidine kinase into the YKO/KD strain collection, as yeast do

968

not encode dCK in their genomes, and thus cannot activate the unphosphorylated drugs.

969

We hypothesized that gemcitabine and cytarabine would have different buffering

970

profiles, despite their similar mechanisms of action, due to their distinct anti-cancer

971

efficacies. Results of the unbiased yeast phenomic experiments confirmed this

972

expectation, revealing distinct, though partially overlapping, gene interaction networks.

973

Differential interaction predominated despite the similarity of the molecules, illustrating

974

that distinct mechanisms for buffering anti-cancer cytotoxic drug responses can be

975

inferred from yeast phenomics and thus applied to predict how an individual’s cancer

976

genome could influence responses to treatment [3,5].

977

Deletion enhancement of both gemcitabine and cytarabine suggested processes

978

that function to buffer nucleoside analog cytotoxicity in common (Fig. 5), in contrast to

979

buffering mechanisms that acted differentially in response to the drugs. Functionally

980

enriched processes that buffered both drugs to a similar extent included the intra-S DNA

981

damage checkpoint, positive regulation of DNA-dependent DNA replication initiation,

982

vesicle fusion with vacuole, and the Mre11, checkpoint clamp, RecQ helicase-Topo III,

983

CORVET, HOPS, ESCRT, GET, Ubp3-Bre5 deubiquitination complexes.

984

Among the drug-specific deletion enhancing interactions, autophagy, histone

985

modification, chromatin remodeling, and peptidyl-tyrosine dephosphorylation buffered

986

gemcitabine more so than cytarabine (Fig. 6). There were only a few cytarabine-specific

987

deletion enhancing GO-enriched terms, but there were many individual genes with

988

human homologs having cancer relevance that buffered cytarabine relatively specifically

989

(Fig. 7). On the other hand, genes that preferentially promote cytotoxicity were observed

990

primarily for gemcitabine, and enriched functions were related to apoptosis, including

991

phosphatidylserine biosynthesis, and the GARP and Lem2/3 complexes (Fig. 6).

992

The model we constructed incorporates the powerful pharmacogenomics

993

datasets and analysis tools from PharmacoDB, mining them by integration of yeast

994

phenomic drug-gene interaction experiments. We integrated yeast phenomic and

995

PharmacoDB data to identify, across the respective datasets, correlations between

996

deletion enhancement and underexpression sensitivity or deletion suppression and

997

overexpression sensitivity. Deletion enhancement indicates genes that are biomarkers

998

and synergistic targets to augment drug efficacy and expand the therapeutic window,

999

whereas deletion suppression identifies genes that promote drug cytotoxicity, and thus

1000

confer sensitivity when hyper-functional and resistance when deficient. A particularly

1001

attractive class of drug-gene interaction is overexpression sensitivity involving driver

1002

genes, however anti-cancer efficacy could be conferred by lethal drug-gene interactions

1003

involving passenger genes, tumor suppressor genes, or components of genetic buffering

1004

networks that become compromised due to genomic instability (Fig. 1A). The cancer

1005

literature revealed many deletion enhancing/UES and deletion suppressing/OES genes

1006

to have roles in cancer, suggesting that integration of yeast phenomic models and

1007

pharmacogenomics data could have clinical utility for choosing cytotoxic treatments

1008

based on gene expression profiles of individual cancers. While predictions sometimes

1009

involved GO-enriched processes, often the genes were identified individually.

1010

The utility of phenomic data (i.e., Q-HTCP of the YKO/KD library) to help predict

1011

causal associations between gene expression changes and cell sensitivity in response

1012

to drugs derives from prior work demonstrating that genes differentially expressed after

1013

drug treatment do not significantly overlap with those that influence sensitivity and

1014

resistance [52]. As far as we know, this work represents the first application of this

1015

fundamental observation from yeast to systems level experimental data from human

1016

cells. Literature-based validations of the yeast phenomic model of nucleoside analogs in

1017

human cancer cell lines and other cancer models are exemplified in Table 6. These

1018

examples illustrate that integrative, systems level drug-gene interaction modeling

1019

employing the experimental power of S. cerevisiae phenomics could be applicable to

1020

cancer genomic profiling for systems level, precision oncology.

1029

In summary, the yeast phenomic model of nucleoside analog toxicity appears to

1030

serve as a valuable resource for interpreting cancer pharmacogenomics data regarding

1031

gene-drug interaction that could be predictive of patient-specific chemotherapeutic

1032

efficacy. Since it’s not possible to collect comparable phenomic information from human

1033

populations or cancerous tissue alone [5], systems level yeast phenomic models can

1034

help expand and integrate relevant (i.e., evolutionarily conserved) aspects of the

1035

extensive cancer literature with regard to cancer-specific vulnerabilities to cytotoxic

1036

therapies. A deeper understanding of how genomic instability influences the genetic

1037

network that buffers chemotherapeutic agents like nucleoside analogs could guide future

1038

research to personalize anti-cancer therapies based on cancer genomic profiles unique

1039

to individual patients. Thus, a future direction for this work should include development

1040

of algorithms that prospectively predict chemotherapy response in individual patient

1041

cancer cells, which could be tested as part of a prognostic evaluation. Most cytotoxic

1042

chemotherapeutic agents are used in combination, so another direction for yeast

1043

phenomic analysis of anti-cancer agents would be to characterize clinically relevant drug

1044

combinations.

1047

Conclusions:
A humanized yeast phenomic model of deoxycytidine kinase was developed to

1048

map drug-gene interactions modulating anti-proliferative effects of nucleoside analogs in

1049

a eukaryotic cell and to investigate the relevance of the resulting networks for precision

1050

oncology by integration with cancer pharmacogenomics-derived associations between

1051

gene expression and cancer cell line drug sensitivity. The yeast phenomic model

1052

revealed gene-drug interaction for the two deoxycytidine analogs, gemcitabine and

1053

cytarabine, to be largely different, consistent with the distinct types of cancer for which

1054

they are used clinically. The model overall suggested evolutionary conservation of drug-

1055

gene interaction that could be used as a resource to predict anti-cancer therapeutic

1056

efficacy based on genetic information specific to individual patients’ tumors. Yeast

1057

phenomics affords a scalable, high-resolution approach to model, at a systems level, the

1058

genetic requirements for sensitivity and resistance to cytotoxic agents and thus the

1059

potential to resolve complex influences of genetic variation on drug response to more

1060

accurately. Global and quantitative models of the distinct genetic buffering networks

1061

required to maintain cellular homeostasis after exposure to chemotherapeutic agents

1062

could aid precision oncology paradigms aimed at identifying composite genomic

1063

derangements that create enhanced cancer cell-specific vulnerabilities to particular anti-

1064

cancer drugs.
