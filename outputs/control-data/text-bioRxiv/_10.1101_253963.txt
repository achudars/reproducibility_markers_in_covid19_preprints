Abstract

22

Human pigmentation is a highly diverse and complex trait among populations, and has drawn

23

particular attention from both academic and non-academic investigators for thousands of

24

years. Previous studies detected selection signals in several human pigmentation genes, but

25

few studies have integrated contribution from multiple genes to the evolution of human

26

pigmentation. Moreover, none has quantified selective pressures on human pigmentation over

27

epochs and between populations. Here, we dissect dynamics and differences of selective

28

pressures during different periods and between distinct populations with new approaches. We

29

propose a new model with multiple populations to estimate historical selective pressures by

30

summarizing selective pressures on multiple genes. We use genotype data of 19 genes

31

associated with human pigmentation from 17 datasets, and obtain data for 2346 individuals of

32

six representative population groups from worldwide. Our results quantify selective pressures

33

on light pigmentation not only in modern Europeans (0.0249/generation) but also in

34

proto-Eurasians (0.00665/generation). Our results also support several derived alleles

35

associated with human dark pigmentation may under directional selection by quantifying

36

differences of selective pressures between populations. Our study provides a first attempt to

37

quantitatively investigate the dynamics of selective pressures during different time periods in

38

the evolution of human pigmentation, and may facilitate studies of the evolution of other

39

complex traits.

Author Summary

42

The color variation of human skin, hair, and eye is affected by multiple genes with different

43

roles. This diversity may be shaped by natural selection and adapted for ultraviolet radiation

44

in different environments around the world. As human populations migrated out from Africa,

45

the ultraviolet radiation in the environment they encountered also changed. It is possible that

46

the selective pressures on human pigmentation varied throughout human evolutionary history.

47

In this study, we develop a new approach and estimate historical selective pressures on light

48

pigmentation not only in modern Europeans but also in proto-Eurasians. To our best

49

knowledge, this is the first study that quantifies selective pressures during different time

50

periods in the evolution of human pigmentation. Besides, we provide statistical evidence to

51

support several genes associated with human dark pigmentation may be favored by natural

52

selection. Thus, natural selection may not only affect light pigmentation in Eurasians, but also

53

influence dark pigmentation in Africans.

Introduction

56

Human pigmentation—the color of human skin, hair, and eye—is one of the most diverse

57

traits among populations. Its obvious diversity has attracted attention from both academic and

58

non-academic investigators for thousands of years, as noted by Charles Darwin one century

59

ago [1] and as noticed by ancient Egyptians more than 4000 years ago [2]. Why human

60

pigmentation diverges, however, remains a central puzzle in human biology [3]. Some

61

researchers have proposed that the diversity of human pigmentation is adapted for ultraviolet

62

radiation (UVR) and driven by natural selection [4–6]. Dark skin may prevent sunburn

63

amongst individuals in low latitude areas with high UVR, while light skin may protect infants

64

against rickets in high latitude areas with low UVR [5–9]. A better understanding of how

65

natural selection shapes the diversity of human pigmentation could provide relevant and

66

beneficial information for public health [4–6].

67

During the last decade, many studies have applied statistical tests to detect signals of

68

natural selection in several human pigmentation genes [10–18]. These genes encode different

69

proteins, including: signal regulators—ASIP, KITLG, MC1R—stimulating the melanogenic

70

pathway; possible enhancers—BNC2, HERC2—regulating pigmentation gene expression;

71

important enzymes—TYR, TYRP1, DCT—converting tyrosine into melanin; putative

72

exchangers—OCA2, SLC24A4, SLC24A5, SLC45A2, TPCN2—controlling the environment

73

within melanosomes; and an exocyst complex unit and molecular motor—EXOC2,

74

MYO5A—conveying vesicles and organelles within the cytoplasm [19–33]. These proteins

75

work at different stages of the melanogenic pathway, illustrating that human pigmentation is a

76

complex trait affected by multiple genes with different roles.

77

Previous studies applied two groups of methods to detect natural selection. One group of

78

methods detects unusually long extended haplotype homozygosity [10–16, 34, 35]. The other

79

group of methods identifies extremely local population differentiation [10, 12–15, 17]. By

80

applying both groups of methods, previous studies have aimed to interpret the evolution of

81

individual pigmentation genes; however, few studies have integrated contributions from

82

multiple genes to the evolution of human pigmentation. Moreover, none of these studies have

83

quantitatively investigated the historical selective pressures of pigmentation genes during

84

different epochs, and compared the differences of selective pressures between different

85

populations. Therefore, it is necessary to perform an extensive quantification of selective

86

pressures on human pigmentation using a creative approach.

87

Results and Discussion

88

The model

89

On the basis of a previous study [36], we measure selective pressures by (genic) selection

90

coefficients. For any single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) L, we can estimate the

91

expectation of the selection (coefficient) difference per generation between populations i and j

92

by
𝑑𝑖𝑗 (𝐿) = [ln

93

𝑝𝑖 (𝐿)
−
𝑞𝑖 (𝐿)

ln

𝑝𝑗 (𝐿)
𝑞𝑗 (𝐿)

] /𝑡𝑖𝑗 ,

(1)

94

where p and q are the frequencies of derived and ancestral alleles in a population, respectively;

95

and tij is the divergence time of the populations i and j from their most recent common

96

ancestor. Details of the calculations are described elsewhere [36].

97

We can extend Eq. 1 to summarize selection differences of multiple SNPs, because a

98

complex trait is usually affected by multiple loci. Here, we take two bi-allelic SNPs as an

99

example. We can estimate the selection difference of a trait affected by two SNPs between

100
101

populations i and j using
𝑑𝑖𝑗 (𝐿1 𝐿2 ) = [ln

𝑝𝑖 (𝐿1 𝐿2 )
−
𝑞𝑖 (𝐿1 𝐿2 )

ln

𝑝𝑗 (𝐿1 𝐿2 )
𝑞𝑗 (𝐿1 𝐿2 )

] /𝑡𝑖𝑗 ,

102

where 𝑝(𝐿1 𝐿2 ) is the frequency of the combination carrying two alleles associated with one

103

possible outcome of a trait, such as light pigmentation; 𝑞(𝐿1 𝐿2 ) is the frequency of the

104

combination carrying two alleles associated with another outcome of the same trait, such as

105

dark pigmentation. With linkage equilibrium between L1 and L2, we have 𝑝(𝐿1 𝐿2 ) =

106

𝑝(𝐿1 )𝑝(𝐿2 ) and 𝑞(𝐿1 𝐿2 ) = 𝑞(𝐿1 )𝑞(𝐿2 ). Thus,

107
108
109
110
111

𝑑𝑖𝑗 (𝐿1 𝐿2 ) = 𝑑𝑖𝑗 (𝐿1 ) + 𝑑𝑖𝑗 (𝐿2 ).
We further assume the distribution of selection difference in each SNP is identical and
independent. Therefore, the variance of 𝑑𝑖𝑗 (𝐿1 𝐿2 ) is
var[𝑑𝑖𝑗 (𝐿1 𝐿2 )] = var[𝑑𝑖𝑗 (𝐿1 )] + var[𝑑𝑖𝑗 (𝐿2 )].
The confidence interval (CI) of 𝑑𝑖𝑗 (𝐿1 𝐿2 ) becomes 𝑑𝑖𝑗 (𝐿1 𝐿2 ) ± 1.96√var[𝑑𝑖𝑗 (𝐿1 𝐿2 )].

112

More generally, for a trait with n SNPs in linkage equilibrium as well as independent and

113

identically distributed selection differences, the expectation and variance of the total selection

114

difference in this trait is

115

𝑑𝑖𝑗 (𝐿1 𝐿2 ⋯ 𝐿𝑛 ) = ∑𝑛𝑖=1 𝑑𝑖𝑗 (𝐿𝑘 )

.
var[𝑑𝑖𝑗 (𝐿1 𝐿2 ⋯ 𝐿𝑛 )] = ∑𝑛𝑖=1 var[𝑑𝑖𝑗 (𝐿𝑘 )]

(2)

116

Based on Eq. 2, we develop a new approach for dissecting historical selective pressures

117

over epochs of the human evolutionary history. We simplify the evolutionary history of six

118

representative human populations as a binary tree (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1. Time-varied selective pressures on an evolutionary tree. We model the evolutionary

121

history of six representative human populations as a binary tree. Here, si (i = 0, 1, ..., 10)

122

denotes the selection coefficient of the i-th epoch and can be obtained by estimating selection

123

differences between paired populations. The numbers on the branches indicate different

124

epochs. Divergence times between populations were based on previous studies [37–40]. We

125

assumed one generation time is ~30 years. We obtain an optimal solution deviated least from

126

neutral evolution using a probabilistic approach. The optimal solution (/generation) is 𝑠1∗ =

127

−0.0188, 𝑠2∗ = −0.0204, 𝑠3∗ = −0.00614, 𝑠4∗ = 0.0249, 𝑠5∗ = 0.00622, 𝑠6∗ = −0.00480, 𝑠7∗ =

129

zero suggest natural selection favored light pigmentation, while those less than zero indicate

130

natural selection preferred dark pigmentation.

131
132

When k is the most recent common ancestor of i and j, we can divide dij in Eq. 1 into
separate terms:
𝑝

𝑝

𝑝

𝑝

133

𝑑𝑖𝑗 𝑡𝑖𝑗 = (ln 𝑞𝑖 − ln 𝑞𝑘 ) − (ln 𝑞𝑗 − ln 𝑞𝑘 ).

134

We can further divide the selection difference between paired populations into multiple terms,

135

if there are multiple branches between them. For example, using the notations and

136

demographic model in Fig. 1, we can estimate the total selection difference between East and

137

West Africans as

𝑑21 𝑡1 = − (ln 𝑞1 − ln 𝑞𝑟 ) + (ln 𝑞2 − ln 𝑞𝑤) + (ln 𝑞𝑤 − ln 𝑞𝑟 ).

138

139

Let 𝑠1 = (ln

140

we have

𝑝1

𝑞𝑤

𝑠10 = (ln

− ln 𝑟 ) /(𝑡1 − 𝑡2 ), then

𝑑21 𝑡1 = −𝑠1 𝑡1 + 𝑠2 𝑡2 + 𝑠10 (𝑡1 − 𝑡2 ).

141
142

Therefore, we can represent the selection difference between paired populations as a

143

combination of selection coefficients during different time periods. Using matrix algebra, we

144

can represent the selection differences of all the paired populations in Fig. 1 as

To obtain the optimal solution, we propose a probabilistic approach. Under neutral

149

evolution (NE), we consider each estimated s as an independent random variable following a

normal distribution with a mean of zero and a variance of σ2. For each solution with ten

151

variables, the summation below follows a chi-square distribution with ten degrees of freedom:
∑10
𝑖=1

152

𝑠𝑖2
~𝜒 2 (10).
𝜎𝑖2

153

Therefore, we have Pr(|s|2 > |sa|2 | NE) ≥ Pr(|s|2 > |sb|2 | NE), if |sa|2 ≤ |sb|2 for solutions a and b.

154

Here, |s|2 is the norm of a vector s. In other words, we can choose the most conservative

155

solution with the least deviation from neutral evolution using a probabilistic approach. Thus,

156

the optimal solution s* is
s ∗ = T + d,

157

(4)

158

where T+ is the pseudo-inverse of T.

159

Selective pressures over epochs

160

We applied our new approach with genotype data of worldwide populations from 17 publicly

161

available datasets (Table S1). After data cleaning (Materials and Methods), we obtained 2346

162

individuals and grouped them into six population groups based on their geographic locations

163

(Table S2). We also selected 52 SNPs in 19 genes for analysis due to their association with

164

human pigmentation in published genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or phenotype

165

prediction models (Table S3). We then used Eq. 2 with 31 SNPs not in strong linkage

166

disequilibrium (r2 < 0.8) to estimate the total selection differences on human pigmentation

167

(Materials and Methods). The maximum differences were observed between Europeans and

168

the two African populations, while the minimum difference was observed between West and

169

East Africans (Table 1). The estimated 95% confidence intervals (CI) indicate the difference

170

between East and West Africans, as well as between Oceanians and East Asians, is likely due

171

to genetic drift (Table 1). We further assessed the significance levels of the observed selection

172

differences by randomly sampling 10,000 sets of 31 SNPs in the genome and obtained the

173

empirical distributions of population differences (Fig. 1). The differences from random sets of

174

SNPs were close to zero, whereas those from SNPs associated with human pigmentation were

175

significantly departure from zero (Fig. 1). This suggests that most population differences on

176

SNPs associated with human pigmentation are possibly contributed by natural selection and

177

not confounded by genetic drift.

189

We then solved the linear system (Eq. 4) with the observed selection differences on

190

human pigmentation (Table 1). Our estimate shows that the modern European lineage had the

191

largest selective pressure (𝑠4∗ = 0.0249/generation) on light pigmentation than the other

192

branches (Fig. 1), suggesting that recent natural selection favored light pigmentation in

193

Europeans. Recent studies using ancient DNA could support our observation of recent

194

directional selection in Europeans [18, 41]. Our results also reveal the selective pressure on

195

light pigmentation in the ancestral population of Europeans and East Asians (𝑠8∗ = 0.00665/

196

generation). This shared selection is also supported by other studies, revealing that ASIP,

197

BNC2, and KITLG were under directional selection before the divergence of ancestral

198

Europeans and East Asians [16, 34]. We further applied SLiM 2 [42] to examine whether the

199

optimal solution could reproduce the observed selection differences (Table 1). We set up a

200

human demographic model according to previous studies and used the optimal solution as

201

selection coefficients during different periods (Materials and Methods). The simulated

202

selection differences were close to the data and little affected by the initial frequency of the

203

beneficial allele (Fig. 3). This also illustrates that though we assume genic selection, our

204

model could approximate genotypic selection in diploids (Materials and Methods).

Selection differences between populations

218

We also separately quantified selection differences of individual SNPs associated with human

219

pigmentation (Table S4) using Eq. 1. Ten SNPs were removed because of their low derived

220

allele frequencies among populations in our data (Materials and Methods). Statistical tests

221

suggest that selective pressures in many loci differed significantly between populations (p <

222

0.05). The remaining 42 SNPs were categorized into five groups (Fig. 4).

229

Red color (positive numbers) indicates selective pressures of populations in rows are larger

230

than those in columns; blue color (negative numbers) indicates selective pressures of

231

populations in rows are smaller than those in columns. Populations are abbreviated as follows:

232

1, West Africans; 2, East Africans; 3, Oceanians; 4, Europeans; 5, North Asians; 6, East

233

Asians

234

In the first group, derived alleles may be affected by Eurasian-shared selection (Fig. 4A).

235

Among these SNPs, rs6119471 (ASIP) has large selection difference between Eurasians and

236

Africans (Table S4). The derived allele of rs6119471 (ASIP) is almost fixed across Eurasians

237

but maintains a low frequency in Africans (Fig. S2). Recent studies applied this SNP to

238

predict dark/non-dark pigmentation phenotype in humans [43]. This may be explained by

239

different selective pressures on this SNP among populations. Other SNPs, such as rs642742

240

(KITLG) and rs10756819 (BNC2), exhibit non-significant differences, suggesting that

241

selection may contribute less to the diversity of these SNPs.

242

Our results also indicate that two SNPs in MC1R (rs2228479 and rs885479) largely differ

243

between Eurasians and Africans (Table S4). Previous studies used variants in MC1R to solve a

244

long-standing puzzle, regarding whether light pigmentation in low UVR areas is caused by

245

directional selection or the relaxation of selective pressures [18, 44, 45]. The relaxation of

246

selective pressures would suggest that the diversity of MC1R variants increased in Eurasians

247

due to the lack of selective constraints. In this scenario, the genetic diversity of MC1R

248

variants could be largely attributed to genetic drift. In contrast, directional selection would

249

suggest that MC1R variants were under positive selection in Eurasians. In this scenario,

250

genetic drift cannot explain the genetic divergence of MC1R between Africans and Eurasians.

251

Our statistical results show that the divergences of rs2228479 and rs885479 between

252

Eurasians and Africans are highly significant departure from neutral evolution (Table S4),

253

suggesting that directional selection is the more likely explanation. Experimental evidence

254

suggests that the derived allele of rs2228479 could cause lower affinity for alpha-melanocyte

255

stimulating hormone than the ancestral allele [46]. Another study showed that the derived

256

allele of rs885479 carries a lower risk of developing freckles and severe solar lentigines than

257

the ancestral allele in East Asians [47]. These studies revealed the potential roles of these

258

MC1R variants in pigmentation phenotypes.

259

In the second group, derived alleles may be affected by African-specific selection (Fig.

260

4B). All these derived alleles are in/near two genes (DDB1 and MFSD12) and were recently

261

associated with human dark pigmentation [48]. The previous study [48] did not find signals of

262

positive selection at MFSD12 using Tajima’s D or iHS. Our method [36] show that these

263

SNPs in MFSD12 differ significantly between Africans and Eurasians—possible signals of

264

directional selection (Table S4). From the first and second groups, we can observe that

265

directional selection not only affects derived alleles associated with light pigmentation in

266

Eurasians, but also influences derived alleles associated with dark pigmentation in Africans.

267

This observation suggests that human pigmentation is under directional selection with

268

diversifying orientations among different populations. Thus, the previous view that the dark

269

pigmentation in Africans is the result of purifying selection on ancestral alleles is incomplete

270

[45]. Moreover, these new loci illustrate that we still have little understanding of the genetic

271

diversity within African populations, and more research in this area is needed [49].

272

The third and fourth groups display European- and Asian-specific selection, respectively

273

(Fig. 4C and 4D). One notable SNP is rs1426654 (SLC24A5), which had the largest selection

274

difference between Europeans and East Asians in our study (0.005774/generation). Previous

275

studies reported that this SNP is under strong directional selection in Europeans [10–15].

276

Another notable SNP is rs1800414 (OCA2), which had a large selection difference between

277

East Asians and other populations. This reveals a potential role of rs1800414 (OCA2) on light

278

pigmentation in East Asians. Several studies have suggested directional selection on this SNP

279

in East Asians [50, 51]. These large selection differences indicate the significant contributions

280

of these SNPs to light pigmentation in Europeans and East Asians, respectively. Other SNPs

281

in these groups also support the hypothesis that recent natural selection for light pigmentation

282

independently occurred in Europeans and Asians since they diverged [14, 50, 51].

283

Interestingly, Oceanians comprise both African-specific (DDB1) and Asian-specific (OCA2)

284

selection. However, due to limited sample size of Oceanians in our data from publicly

285

available resources (Table S2), it should be cautious to interpret these results. Thus, it would

286

be helpful to analyze larger datasets of Oceanians to confirm our observation.

287

The last group includes the five remaining SNPs (Fig. 4E), which exhibit specific

288

selection differences between limited population pairs. Among them, the derived allele of

289

rs1800401 (OCA2) and the ancestral allele of rs12896399 (SLC24A4) are both associated with

290

dark pigmentation (Table S2). Only rs12896399 (SLC24A4) differs significantly between

291

West Africans and Eurasians (Table S4). This may be a selection signal associated with dark

292

pigmentation in West Africans, again indicating possible genetic diversity within African

293

populations. We note that rs35264875 (TPCN2) and rs12821256 (KITLG) might be affected

294

by selection in both East Africans and Europeans. A recent study showed that rs12821256

295

might have large effect on the skin pigmentation in South Africans [52]. The other two SNPs,

296

rs3829241 (TPCN2) and rs642742 (KITLG), also differ between Eurasians and Africans (Fig.

297

4A). These similar patterns of TPCN2 and KITLG might suggest some connection between

298

them.

299

Compared with previous studies [10–18], our study has three advantages. First, our

300

approach considers the fluctuation of selective pressures that was ignored by previous studies.

301

Our results provide more information about the dynamics of selective pressures during human

302

evolution. Second, we summarize selective pressures based on multiple human pigmentation

303

genes (Eq. 2), while previous studies usually tested selection signals in individual human

304

pigmentation genes. Moreover, we simultaneously interpret selective pressures in multiple

305

populations, whereas previous studies separately investigated selection signals in single

306

population. Third, we do not need to assume population continuity as in those ancient DNA

307

studies [18, 41], because our study is based on genetic data from only present-day

308

populations.

309

We note that our investigation has several limitations. First, our model is based on the

310

infinite population size model. The limited sample size would affect our results, therefore, we

311

grouped populations into a large population group based on their geographic locations to

312

mitigate the effect of sample size. Analysis of data with larger sample size could improve our

313

estimate, as more and more genomic datasets become available. Second, although we chose

314

the solution that deviates least from neutral evolution as the optimal solution, we cannot

315

exclude the possibility of other solutions. This reflects the difficulty of analyzing historical

316

selective pressures, which is a well-recognized challenge in population genetics [53]. Our
16

317

solution provides a first step toward resolving the dynamics of selection in the evolution of

318

human pigmentation. This solution may be improved by combining both ancient and modern

319

human genetic data, as well as by using a Bayesian framework with varied selection

320

coefficients among loci for inference. Adding more population groups would also possibly

321

improve the solution, because this would provide more constraints in the linear system (Eq. 4).

322

Third, our results may be affected by a severe bottleneck. A recent study [53] suggests a more

323

severe Out-of-Africa bottleneck in human evolutionary history than in the model used in our

324

simulation. This would probably reduce the selection differences between Eurasians and

325

Africans, leading to an underestimation of selective pressures. Fourth, our results may also be

326

affected by population migration and sub-structure. We used knowledge from previous studies,

327

principle component analysis and F3 test to rigorously prune potential admixed populations,

328

including South Asians, Central Asians, the Middle East People and Americans. Removing

329

these populations would lose information of selective pressures on human pigmentation in

330

these lineages; however, as a first step to explore the historical selective pressures in the

331

evolution of human pigmentation, we focused more on reducing the bias induced by

332

population admixture. New methods explicitly accounting for population admixture would be

333

helpful to provide more comprehensive view on the dynamics of selective pressures during

334

the evolution of human pigmentation. Besides, we demonstrate that our estimate provides

335

lower bounds of selection differences on human pigmentation when migration or

336

sub-structure exists (Text S1). Finally, our candidate SNPs may be biased. For example, our

337

results indicate small genetic differences on human pigmentation between these two

338

populations (Table 1), while recent studies [52] suggest Oceanians are darker than East Asians

339

in skin pigmentation using melanin index. One possible reason is that some Oceanian-specific

340

or East-Asian-specific SNPs are missing. This is because we selected candidates based on

341

results from published GWAS or phenotype prediction models, and most of these studies used

342

samples with European ancestry [55]. More studies on non-European populations could

343

resolve this missing diversity and enhance our knowledge on the evolution of human

344

pigmentation.

345

To summarize, we extended an established method [36] to dissect dynamics of selective

346

pressures over epochs. Our study provides the first attempt to resolve time-varied selective
17

347

pressures in the evolution of human pigmentation. The fluctuation of selective pressures is an

348

important factor in evolution [53], but few studies have revealed time-varied selective

349

pressures in human populations. Our study also provides information on differences of

350

selective pressures between distinct population groups. Further studies are in progress to

351

verify our present views on the evolution of human pigmentation.

352

Materials and Methods

353

Data preparation

354

Seventeen datasets [40, 56–71] containing genotype data from worldwide human populations

355

were obtained from the listed resources (Table S1). After downloading, all the genotype data

356

were liftovered to genomic coordinates using the Human Reference Genome hg19. A merged

357

dataset containing 6531 individuals was obtained after removing duplicated and related

358

individuals. After merging, SNPs with call rate less than 0.99 or individuals with call rate less

359

than 0.95 were removed. SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium were further removed by

360

applying a window of 200 SNPs advanced by 25 SNPs and an r2 threshold of 0.8

361

(--indep-pairwise 200 25 0.8) in PLINK 1.7 [72]. The remaining 61,597 SNPs were used for

362

further analysis. In order to mitigate the bias induced by population migration, potential

363

admixed populations, such as the Middle East People and South Asians, were excluded

364

according to previous studies [40, 56–71], principal component analysis (PCA) using

365

SMARTPCA (version: 13050) from EIGENSOFT (version: 6.0.1) [73, 74], and F3 test using

366

ADMIXTOOLS (version: 3.0) [75]. Finally, 2346 individuals were obtained and divided into

367

six groups according to their geographic regions for further analysis. These groups are West

368

Africans, East Africans, Oceanians, Europeans, North Asians and East Asians. The PCA plot

369

(Fig. S1) shows that these 2346 individuals were properly separated into six population

370

groups.

373

Data imputation

374

Genotypes of 19 human pigmentation genes with 500-kb flanking sequences on both sides

375

were obtained from the genotype datasets. Haplotype inference and genotype imputation were

376

performed on the selected genotypes using BEAGLE 4.1 [76, 77] with 1000 Genomes phase

377

3 haplotypes as the reference panel. During phasing and imputation, the effective population

378

size was assumed to be 10,000 (Ne = 10000), and the other parameters were set to the default

379

values. Ten SNPs (rs1110400, rs11547464, rs12203592, rs1800407, rs1805005, rs1805006,

380

rs1805007, rs1805008, rs1805009, rs74653330) were removed because of their low derived

381

allele frequencies in our datasets after imputation (Fig. S2). Because rs12203592 (IRF4) was

382

removed, 18 genes with the remaining 42 SNPs were used for further analysis.

388

We used Eq. 1 to estimate the selection differences of the remaining 42 SNPs. We then used

389

Eq. 2 and selected 31 SNPs not in strong linkage disequilibrium (r2 < 0.8) as well as known

390

phenotypes to estimate the total selection differences on human pigmentation between

391

populations. These SNPs were: rs3829241, rs56203814, rs916977, rs1800414, rs10424065,

392

rs6119471, rs1408799, rs11230664, rs1407995, rs4959270, rs1800401, rs2378249, rs1042602,

rs2228479, rs35264875, rs12896399, rs26722, rs16891982, rs885479, rs28777, rs1800404,

395

rs10756819, rs2402130. To dissect selective pressures over epochs, we applied Eq. 4 with the

396

total selection differences from the selected 31 SNPs and the divergence times shown in Fig.

397

398

Reproducing the observed selection differences from the optimal solution

399

We used SLiM 2 (version: 2.6) [42] to simulate a demographic model of human evolution

400

(Fig. S3) to examine whether the optimal solution could reproduce the observed selection

401

differences. We varied the initial frequency of the beneficial allele with 0.001 and 0.01. We

402

divided the optimal solution by 31 to obtain the average selection coefficient for each SNP,

403

because we used 31 SNPs to estimate the total selection differences on human pigmentation

404

(Text S2). We used the effective population size of each population estimated by previous

405

studies [78, 79]. We set both the mutation rate and the recombination rate to 1 ×

406

10-8/generation/site. In each run, we simulated a fragment with 106 base pairs, and set the

407

50,000th site under selection. We repeated each set of parameters more than 10,000 times, and

408

analyzed those results in which beneficial alleles were not fixed or lost in all the populations.

409

We compared the average selection differences from simulation with the observed selection

410

differences.

We noticed that the selection coefficient in SLiM 2 measures differences in fitness

fitness of genotype Aa is 1 + s = 1 + 0.5s . If s' is the selection coefficient in SLiM 2, then s'

Text S1. The effects of migration and substructure.

701

 pˆ
pˆ j
In this section, we examined how the estimated selection difference dˆij =  ln i − ln
 qˆi
qˆ j


702

is affected by population migration and substructure in theory. Here, pˆ i and qˆi are the

703

observed derived and ancestral allele frequencies in the population i, respectively; pˆ j and

704

qˆ j are the observed derived and ancestral allele frequencies in the population j, respectively;

705

and t is the divergence time from populations i and j to their most recent common ancestor.

706

We demonstrated that dˆij provides a lower bound of selection difference between

707

populations i and j when migration or substructure exists. We first provide two inequalities

708

that will be used later.

709

Inequality 1: If a  b  0 , c  d  0 , then ac  bd and

710

Proof: a  b  0 , c  d  0 , then ac  bc , bc  bd . Therefore, ac  bd . Furthermore,

711

ac + ab  bd + ab , which is the same as a ( b + c )  b ( a + d ) . Therefore,

712

Inequality 2: If a1  0, a2  0,L , an  0 , a =  ai / n , then max a1 , a2 ,L , an   a ,

a+d a
 .

i =1

713

min a1 , a2 ,L , an   a .

714

Proof: Let amax = max a1 , a2 ,L , an  , then

amax − a =   amax −  ai  / n

,

715

n

=  ( amax − ai ) / n  0
i =1

716

because amax  ai .

717

Let amin = min a1 , a2 ,L , an  , then

because amin  ai .
For the proofs in below, we assume dˆij  0 without loss of generality. If dˆij  0 , then

721

we can exchange i and j, and still obtain dˆ ji  0 .

722

The effect of migration

723

Suppose there is α proportion of individuals in the population i, which actually come from the

724

population j; also, there is β proportion of individuals in the population j, which actually come

725

 1
from the population i. Here,  ,   0,  , because we assume migrants should not become
 2

726

the majority of another population. Then we have
pˆ i
qˆi
pˆ j
qˆ j

727

= (1 −  ) pi +  p j
= (1 −  ) qi +  q j
.
= (1 −  ) p j +  pi
= (1 −  ) q j +  qi

728

Here, pi and qi are the true derived and ancestral allele frequencies in the population i,

729

respectively; p j and q j are the true derived and ancestral allele frequencies in the

730

population j, respectively. Therefore,

731

732

pˆ i qˆ j = (1 −  ) pi +  p j  (1 −  ) q j +  qi 
= (1 −  )(1 −  ) pi q j +  (1 −  ) p j q j +  (1 −  ) pi qi +  qi p j
qˆi pˆ j = (1 −  ) qi +  q j  (1 −  ) p j +  pi 
= (1 −  )(1 −  ) qi p j +  (1 −  ) p j q j +  (1 −  ) pi qi +  pi q j

.

Further, we have

pˆ i qˆ j − qˆi pˆ j = (1 −  )(1 −  ) ( pi q j − qi p j ) +  ( qi p j − pi q j )
733

= (1 −  )(1 −  ) −   ( pi q j − qi p j )

.

= (1 −  −  ) ( pi q j − qi p j )

734

 1
Because  ,   0,  , then 1 −  −   0 ; and pˆ i qˆ j  qˆi pˆ j , therefore, pi q j − qi p j  0 .

migration exists between populations i and j, the estimated selection difference is lower than

740

the true value.

741

The effect of substructure

742

Scenario 1: The population j has k subpopulations.

743

If the population j has k subpopulations, then pˆ j =

744

allele frequency in the subpopulation k of the population j. And N j is the population size of

745

the population j, N j =  k N jk . We denote the minimum of p jk as min ( p jk ) . Because

746

q jk = 1 − p jk , then max ( q jk ) = 1 − min ( p jk ) . Based on Inequality 2, pˆ j  min ( p jk ) ,

747

qˆ j  max ( q jk ) . Therefore, ln

Scenario 2: The population i has l subpopulations.

If the population i has l subpopulations, then pˆ i =

In summary, if populations i and j have subpopulations, and their estimated selection

difference is larger than zero, then at least one pair of their subpopulations has selection
