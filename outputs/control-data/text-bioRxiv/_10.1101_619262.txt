Abstract
Autozygosity, meaning inheritance of an ancestral allele in the homozygous state is known to lead bi-allelic
mutations that manifest their effects through the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. Autosomal recessive
mutations are known to be the underlying cause of several Mendelian metabolic diseases, especially among the
offspring of related individuals. In line with this, inbreeding coefficient of an individual as a measure of cryptic
autozygosity among the general population is known to lead adverse metabolic outcomes including Type 2
diabetes (T2DM); a multifactorial metabolic disease for which the recessive genetic causes remain unknown. In
order to unravel such effects for multiple metabolic facades of the disease, we investigated the relationship
between the excess of homozygosity and the metabolic signature of T2DM. We included a set of 53 metabolic
phenotypes, including 47 metabolites, T2DM and five T2DM risk factors, measured in a Dutch genetic isolate of
2,580 people. For 20 of these markers, we identified 29 regions of homozygous (ROHs) associated with the nominal
significance of P-value < 1.0 × 10-3. By performing association according to the recessive genetic model within these
selected regions, we identified and replicated two intronic variants: rs6759814 located in KCNH7 associated with
valine and rs1573707 located in PTPRT associated with IDL-free cholesterol and IDL-phospholipids. Additionally,
we identified a rare intronic SNV in TBR1 for which the homozygous individuals were enriched for obesity.
Interestingly, all three genes are mainly neuronally expressed and pointed out the involvement of glutamergic
synaptic transmission pathways in the regulation of metabolic pathways. Taken together our study underline the
additional benefits of model supervised analysis, but also seconds the involvement of the central nervous system
in T2DM and obesity pathogenesis.

Introduction

2

Consanguineous marriages between close relatives as a result of assertive mating is known to cause

3

severe metabolic diseases in the off-spring(VERNON 2015). In addition to that, moderate inbreeding due to isolation

4

in populations has been shown to cause unfavorable outcomes among with cardio-metabolic and neuropsychiatric

5

parameters(VERWEIJ et al. 2014; HOWRIGAN et al. 2016). The previous report shows evidence that inbreeding

6

associates with an increase in blood pressure, glucose and decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-

7

C), intelligence quotient (IQ) and height(MCQUILLAN et al. 2012). In the decade, technological advances in

8

metabolomics allow researchers to capture the biochemical status in an organism. As one of the most common

9

metabolic disorders, studying the metabolomics of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is particularly promising as the

10

deregulation of biochemical processes is involved in the pathophysiology of T2DM. In line with this, many

11

circulating metabolites have been found associated with T2DM: including phospholipids, branch-chain amino-acids

12

and lipoprotein subclasses(WANG et al. 2005; WANG et al. 2011; LIU et al. 2017).

13

In our previous report, we tested the evidence of recessive SNP effects. We revealed that six out of the

14

eight quantitative metabolite genetic loci showed a recessive rather than an additive effect on the metabolite

15

(DEMIRKAN et al. 2015). This raises an important question of whether such recessive variants are relevant for

16

metabolic diseases such as T2DM and its markers. In order to answer this question and find genetic loci that act

17

under recessive inheritance, we first defined runs of homozygosity (ROHs) that relate to T2DM and its circulating

18

profile in blood in the genetically isolated ERF population and then looked for the causal recessive variants within

19

the loci using coding variants. We focused on a set of 47 metabolites which we selected based on their correlation

20

to inbreeding in the population(DEMIRKAN et al. 2019). On top of that, we additionally studied the five commonly

21

measured metabolic phenotypes, i.e. body-mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR), fasting glucose, insulin and

22

homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), as well as T2DM case/control status in the ERF

23

population.

Study population

27

The Erasmus Rucphen Family genetic isolate study (ERF) is a prospective family-based study located in

28

Southwest of the Netherlands. This young genetic isolate was founded in the mid-eighteenth century and minimal

immigration and marriages occurred between surrounding settlements due to social and religious reasons. The

30

study population includes 3,465 individuals that are living descendants of 22 couples with at least six children

31

baptized. Informed consent has been obtained from patients where appropriate. The study protocol was approved

32

by the medical ethics board of the Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam, the Netherlands(SANTOS et al. 2006). The

33

baseline demographic data and measurements of the ERF participants were collected around 2002 to 2006. All the

34

participants filled out questionnaires on socio-demographics, diseases and medical history and lifestyle factors,

35

and were invited to the research center for an interview and blood collection for biochemistry and physical

36

examinations including blood pressure and anthropometric measurements have been performed. The participants

37

were asked to bring all their current medications for registration during the interview. Venous blood samples were

38

collected after at least eight hours of fasting. Baseline type 2 diabetes was defined according to the fasting plasma

39

glucose ≥ 7.0mmol/L and/or anti-diabetic treatment, yielding 212 cases and 2,564 controls, totaling up to 2,776.

40

The follow-up data collection of the ERF study took place in May 2016 (9 to 14 years after baseline visit). During

41

the follow up a total of 1,935 participants' records were scanned for the incidence of type 2 diabetes in general

42

practitioner’s databases. Additionally, a questionnaire on type 2 diabetes medication surveyed on 1,232

43

participants in June 2010 (4 to 8 years after baseline visit) was referred if a participant were not included in May

44

2016 follow-up. This effort yielded the inclusion of 18 otherwise missed extra cases, yielding a total of 349 cases

45

and 2,427 controls in the current study.

46
47

Metabolite measurements

48

Metabolic markers were measured by five different metabolomics platforms using the methods which

49

have been described in earlier publications(DEMIRKAN et al. 2012; GONZALEZ-COVARRUBIAS et al. 2013; DEMIRKAN et al.

50

2015; DRAISMA et al. 2015; KETTUNEN et al. 2016). In total 562 metabolic markers including sub-fractions of

51

lipoproteins, triglycerides, phospholipids, ceramides, amino acids, acyl-carnitines and small intermediate

52

compounds, which throughout this article will be referred as “metabolites”, were measured either by nuclear

53

magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry or by mass spectrometry (MS). The platforms used in this research are:

54

(1) Liquid Chromatography-MS (LC-MS, 116 positively charged lipids, comprising of 39 triglycerides, 47

71

the experiments were carried out at the Metabolomics Platform of the Genome Analysis Center at the Helmholtz

72

Zentrum München, Germany as per the manufacturer’s instructions. The laboratories had no access to phenotype

73

information.

75

Genome-wide SNP measurements

76

Genotyping in ERF was performed using Illumina 318/370 K, Affymetrix 250 K, and Illumina 6K micro-

77

arrays. All SNPs were imputed using MACH software (www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/MaCH/) based on the

78

Hapmap2 (release 22, build 36). Individuals were excluded for excess autosomal heterozygosity, mismatches

79

between called and phenotypic gender, and if there were outliers identified by an identical-by-state (IBS) clustering

80

analysis.

82

Defining ROHs and regression

83

We used Hapmap2 (release 22, build 36) imputations for the extraction of homozygosity per loci per

84

individual. The best guess information used for SNPs with imputation quality (R2) > 0.95. The algorithm used to

85

define the region-wise homozygosity was developed by the ROHGEN consortium as explained before(CEBALLOS et

86

al. 2018). In brief, the genome was divided into 3 Mb windows (n=992) and for each window, a plink sliding window

87

routine was used to identify the proportion of >1.5 Mb homozygosity within the window. For each window, a

88

maximum of one heterozygous SNP and five missing measurements were allowed. All SNP ids were mapped to the

89

human genome build 19 (hg19) coordinates. The regression analyses were performed using mixed models,

90

adjusting for genetic relatedness using a genomic kinship matrix; age, sex, and first 10 principal components were

91

used as covariates in the model.

92
93

Exome sequence measurements

94

Exomes of 1,336 randomly selected individuals from the ERF study cohort were sequenced at the Center

95

for Biomics of the Cell Biology department, at the Erasmus MC, The Netherlands. Sequencing was done at a median

96

depth of 57x using the Agilent version V4 capture kit, on an Illumina Hiseq2000 sequencer, using the TruSeq

97

Version 3 protocol. The sequence reads were aligned to hg19, using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) and the

98

NARWHAL pipeline(LI AND DURBIN 2009), (BROUWER et al. 2012) (LI et al. 2009). Subsequently, the aligned reads were

99

processed further, using the IndelRealigner, MarkDuplicates and Table Recalibration tools from the Genome

100

Analysis Toolkit (GATK)(MCKENNA et al. 2010) and Picard (http://picard.sourceforge.net). This was necessary to

101

remove systematic biases and to recalibrate the PHRED quality scores in the alignments. After processing, genetic

102

variants were called, using the Unified Genotyper tool from the GATK(MCKENNA et al. 2010). For each sample, at

103

least four Gigabases of sequence was aligned to the genome. Functional annotations were also performed using

104

the SeattleSeq annotation 138 database. About 1.4 million SNVs were called. After removing variants with low

105

quality, out of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE, P-value < 10-6) and low call rate (< 99%), and samples with a low

106

call rate (< 90%), we retrieved 543,954 very high-quality SNVs in 1,327 individuals.

107
108

Exome chip measurements

109

Study participants from the ERF study whose exomes were not sequenced (N = 1,527) were genotyped

110

on the Illumina Infinium HumanExome BeadChip, version 1.1, which contains over 240,000 exonic variants selected

111

from multiple sources together spanning 12,000 samples from multiple ethnicities. Calling was performed with

112

GenomeStudio. We removed subjects with a call rate < 95%, IBS > 0.99 and heterozygote ratio > 0.60. Ethnic

113

outliers identified using a principal component analysis with 1000 Genomes data and individuals with sex

114

discrepancies were also removed. The SNVs that were monomorphic in our sample or had a call rate < 95% were

115

removed. After quality control, we retrieved about 70,000 polymorphic SNVs in 1,515 subjects.

116
117

Genetic association analyses

118

Exome chip and sequence-based genetic variants

119

All tests were performed using RVtests (version 20150630), adjusted by age, sex and familial relatedness

120

using a genome wide-autosomal kinship matrix(ZHAN et al. 2016). Single variant association analyses were

121

performed for variants that have more than five copies of homozygous presentation in the population, using a

122

recessive genetic model.

123
124

Imputation-based genetic variants

125

The SNPs with less than five minor allele counts were excluded. The exclusion criteria for SNPs were HWE

126

with P-value < 1.0 × 10-6 or SNP call rate < 98%. The associations of the significant metabolites within the genotype

127

in these regions were performed by linear regression with ProbABEL software in both recessive model and

128

dominant model in order to capture the homozygous model for both effect and non-effect alleles. The residuals

129

of the metabolites with age, sex and family-relationship matrix were calculated by the polygenic function in R

130

package GenABEL and used in the region-wide associations. The associations within the regions were performed

131

using the 1000G phase 1, release v3. All SNP ids were mapped to hg19 coordinates. The genotype data of a

132

population-based cohort, Rotterdam Study(IKRAM et al. 2017) (n = 6,291), was also used to replicate the findings.

133

Candidate genes within the ROH were selected by in-house developed automated pathway search

134

algorithm as explained before(DEMIRKAN et al. 2015). The selection algorithm combines information from GTEx-

135

eQTL, GWAS catalog, ConsensusPathDB(KAMBUROV et al. 2011), UniProtKB(MAGRANE 2011), OMIM(MCKUSICK 1998),

136

TCDB(SAIER JR et al. 2006), ExPASy(GASTEIGER et al. 2003) and KEGG database(KANEHISA AND GOTO 2000) for each

137

genetic loci.

141

In total, 47 metabolites selected in ERF population in an earlier report(DEMIRKAN et al. 2019) in addition to

142

T2DM and five T2DM-related phenotypes were included in the ROH regression analysis with 992 windows

143

constructed genome-wide. These analyses yielded 3,334 window-metabolite pairs with association p-value < 0.05.

144

However, none of the associations passed either the false discovery rate (FDR), or Bonferroni threshold defined as

145

correction by the number of windows tested times the independent dimensions in the highly correlated data(LI

146

AND JI 2005) (0.05/ (992 × 27) = 2.02 × 10-6). Out of 3,334, 1,734 association pairs showed consistent direction with

147

the initially calculated association to inbreeding coefficients from our earlier report(DEMIRKAN et al. 2019). We

148

focused on the suggestive top loci with association P-value < 1.0 × 10-3 for further analysis. These associations with

149

ROH and phenotypes are given in Table 1. The list included 29 genomic loci identified as full or partial homozygosity

150

within a 3MB, influencing 20 different outcomes, in total making up 51 suggestive pairs of association for follow-

151

up. In some loci, the neighboring regions were correlated indicating that the ROH detected was indeed larger than

152

3MB window (Supplementary Figure 1). The top significant ROH which is shared by 33 individuals is located at 36

153

to 39 MB on chromosome 4 and is associated with four small size LDL components (S-LDL-Free cholesterol, S-LDL-

154

phospholipids, S-LDL-cholesterol, S-LDL-ApoB) and included candidate genes TLR and PGM2. The second top ROH

155

shared by 43 individuals is located at 63 to 66 MB on chromosome 3, and is associated with a lifetime risk of T2DM

156

(β = 0.43, P-value=5.43 × 10-6) and included candidate genes PSMD6 and ADAMTS9 (Table 1). ROH located at

157

chromosome 4, 30-33 Mb was highest frequently shared (420 individuals). The strongest association was found

158

between this ROH and S-LDL-Free cholesterol (β = 1.35, P-value = 7.48 × 10-5), followed by S-LDL-cholesterol, S-

159

LDL-phospholipids and S-VLDL-triglycerides. For the rest 26 top ROH the number of carrier individuals ranged

160

between 20 to 118. Distributions of the 29 ROH in ERF population are provided in Supplementary Figure 2.

Association with exonic variants

164

For each locus, the association for the minor allele under the recessive models has been tested, results

165

are shown in Table 2a and Table 2b with sequence and chip-based genotyping sets respectively. We used three

166

steps of variant filtering. First, we adopted a liberal variant list and included all the SNVs that are captured within

167

the sequence data, also including the intergenic and intronic variants that are captured around the exons. For each

168

region, we set up a region-wide Bonferroni threshold based on the number of SNVs tested and based on that we

169

identified the significantly associated SNVs. By this way five SNVs from exonic sequences were detected inside

170

genes TTC7A (rs57182920, intronic, with XL-HDL-Cholesterol), FRMD4B (rs73095903, intronic, with M-VLDL-TGs),

171

CSMD3 (rs72685825, intronic, with S-HDL-ApoA1), PREX1 (rs3746820, synonymous, with IDL-phospholipids),

172

LAMA5 (rs35653162, intronic, with glucose) in addition to one SNV detected inside a non-transcribed pseudogene

173

EXOC5P1 (rs6551721, exonic, with Phosphatidylcholine diacyl C 40:6) as shown in Table 2 and Supplementary

174

Table 1. By using the exome chip derived genetic data, we detected three SNVs; one located inside KCNH7

175

(rs6759814, intronic, with valine), and two from intergenic regions (rs6469084, associated with S-HDL-ApoA1 and

176

rs6101991 associated with IDL-phospholipids) detected passing the pre-defined region-specific association

177

thresholds (Table 3 and Supplementary Table 2). Second, we limited the analysis to synonymous and non-

178

synonymous SNVs stop codons, UTR and splice variants only. By this way, additional two synonymous SNVs located

179

in OXR1 (rs1681904, with S-HDL-ApoA1) and FRMD4B (rs62254461, with M-VLDL-triglycerides) were found using

180

the exonic sequences (Table 2). Using the same approach one missense coding SNV in the exome chip was found

181

associated within KRT15 gene (rs1050784, with T2DM) (Table 3). Third, we filtered the dataset such that we

182

focused on only to those missense and premature stop codons. However, no SNVs were found associated using

183

such strict filtering.

184
185

Association with common variants and intergenic regions

186

Table 4 and Supplementary Table 3 shows the region-wide association with 1000 genome imputed

187

genotypes within the candidate ROHs. The locus zoom plots of loci with significant SNPs are given in

188

Supplementary Figure 3. In total, common genetic variants in six regions passed the region-wide FDR. These

189

included rs59997916 (intronic MAGI1, with T2DM), rs10866392 (intronic LINCO2506, with S-LDL-Free cholesterol),

190

rs73240383 (intronic, NWD2, with S-LDL-ApoB), rs71562230 (intergenic near SLC22A16, with S-VLDL-triglycerides),

191

rs1573707 (intronic, PTPRT, with IDL-Free cholesterol, IDL-phospholipids) and rs75320186 (upstream of BIRC7,

192

with glucose).

193

In order to investigate the effect of these variants in the outbred population, Rotterdam Study we set out

194

a replication. Out of the 18 genetic associations coming either from exome sequencing, exome chip or imputation

195

sets, we were able to test 12 in the Rotterdam study as 6 of the phenotypes were not available for replication.

(Table 5 and Supplementary Table 4). After correcting for multiple testing, we replicated two intronic genetic

variants are located in genes KCNH7 (rs6759814) and PTPRT (rs1573707).

198
199

Shared rare homozygous SNVs within the ROH regions

200

In parallel to the association analysis explained above, we searched for overweight (BMI > 25.0 kg/m2),

201

obese (BMI > 30.0 kg/m2) and T2DM cases among the ROH carriers who also share the same rare (MAF <0.05)

202

genetic variants identified by exome sequence or exome chip. By this way, we found additional 28 rare variants

203

were shared exclusively by the ROH carriers within the genomic regions of interest. After exploring the phenotypes

204

of the individuals homozygous for these exclusive 28 rare SNVs, for 18 of them, we detected an enrichment of

205

cases of T2DM and obesity, clustering among 32 homozygous individuals. Eight out of 32 had T2DM (25.0%), 19

206

were overweight (59.4%) and 11 were obese (34.4%). Among the 18 rare SNVs, rs116175783 located in TBR1 can

also be detected in the Rotterdam Study in eight homozygous persons. Six of them (75.0%) were overweight and

208

one was obese in the Rotterdam Study. In ERF one out of the two homozygous individuals is obese and has T2DM,

209

whereas the other homozygous individual is overweight (Table 6).

Discussion

212

We report an in-depth association mapping effort for a total of 53 selected metabolic phenotypes by using

213

three sets of independently generated genotype data. First, we point out increased homozygosity in 29 genomic

214

loci influencing 20 different outcomes, suggesting 51 outcome-genomic locus pairs to be investigated by more in-

215

depth analysis. By using the recessive genetic model for association testing, we detected and replicated 2 intronic

216

genetic variants inside genes KCNH7 and PTPRT. Additionally, within the ROHs we report 18 rare variants in a group

217

of individuals enriched by cases of obesity and T2DM. Among these 18 rare variants, 17 were specific to ERF

218

population, whereas one (rs116175783, located in TBR1) was also found in the Rotterdam study, and remarkably

219

six out of eight homozygous individuals are overweight.

220

Evolutionary selection is less effective in eliminating recessive deleterious alleles since it needs two copies

221

to reduce the fitness of the organism, those tend to become more frequent than expected. The most favorable

222

setting to observe the effect of recessive deleterious genetic variants is consanguineous families or inbred

223

populations. Harmful effects of close consanguinity in humans have been shown for several of outcomes including

intelligence(FAREED AND AFZAL 2014), schizophrenia(MANSOUR et al. 2010), bipolar disorder(MANSOUR et al. 2009),

225

hypertension(RUDAN et al. 2003), heart disease(SHAMI et al. 1991), cancer(LEBEL AND GALLAGHER 1989), but notably

226

also for metabolic health(ISAACS et al. 2007) and T2DM(GOSADI et al. 2014). Since consanguinity is strongly

227

associated with risk for multifactorial disease, it is more than likely that unknown homozygous regions of the

228

genome explain a significant portion of familial aggregation among other possible mechanisms(HOPPENBROUWERS

229

et al. 2007). ROHs have been associated with several human traits such as personality(VERWEIJ et al. 2012),

230

schizophrenia(KELLER et al. 2012), short stature(MCQUILLAN et al. 2012) and birth height(VERWEIJ et al. 2014).

231

To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating metabolomics phenotypes by homozygosity

232

mapping. We show that the homozygosity of the minor C allele of synonymous SNV rs6759814 located in KCNH7

233

associates with branch chain amino acid valine in our study. KCNH7 belongs to the ERG subfamily of voltage-gated

234

potassium channels and is widely expressed by the central nervous system. Voltage-gated potassium channels

235

have diverse functions including regulating neurotransmitter release, heart rate, insulin secretion, neuronal

236

excitability, epithelial electrolyte transport, smooth muscle contraction, and cell volume.

237

Earlier we showed an association of another intronic genetic variant (rs1474260) in KCNH7 and a

238

polyunsaturated ether-phosphatidylcholine (PCae36:5) in a meta-analysis, using the additive genetic

239

model(DEMIRKAN et al. 2012). The second replicated SNV is another synonymous intronic variant (rs1573707) in

240

PTPRT associated with IDL-Free cholesterol, IDL-phospholipids. PTPRT is a member of the protein tyrosine

241

phosphatase (PTP) family. PTPs are known to be signaling molecules that regulate a variety of cellular processes

242

including cell growth, differentiation, mitotic cycle, and oncogenic transformation. It is of note that both KCNH7

243

and PTPRT are neuronal proteins associated with glutamate receptor signaling pathway (p-value=5.5 x 10-4 for

244

KCNH7 and p-value= 2.6 x 10-7 for PTPRT gene expression in blood) as classified by Gene Ontology (GO)- biological

245

process terms, and summarized by genenetwork.nl (accession date: 16.4.2019). Additionally, both proteins map

246

to regulation of insulin secretion (p-value=6.6 x 10-4 for PTPRT and p-value=3.5 x 10-4 for KCNH7) among the

247

biological processes classified by GO (www.genenetwork.nl, accession date: 16.04.2019). Finally, by looking at

248

shared homozygous SNVs exclusively by the individuals sharing homozygous regions, we show that a rare genetic

249

variant (rs116175783) shared by a total of 10 individuals in both ERF and Rotterdam Study is interesting as all of

250

the individuals are either overweight or obese. TBR1 is also a neuronal protein mainly involved in the regulation of

251

glutamergic synaptic transmission (P-value = 3.1 x 10-7) associated with behavioral fear response (P-value = 2.7 x

10-7). Remarkably, feeding behavior (P-value = 8.1 x 10-3) is one of the top GO terms for this gene. Based on GWAS

253

using additive genetic model TBR1 was found associated with gene-based also associates with sodium in blood (P-

254

value = 3.8 x 10-10), educational attainment (P-value = 1.8 x 10-8), diagnosed High blood pressure (2.7 x 10-8) but

255

also with BMI (6.1 x 10-6) to some degree (http://atlas.ctglab.nl/PheWAS, accession date: 16.04.2019). In our study,

256

the region harboring TBR1 was initially selected because the homozygosity was associated with a decrease in XL-

257

HDL-cholesterol level.

258

Overall by combining the power of recessive inheritance in a genetically isolated population with a wide

259

range of metabolic pathways, we pointed out several genetic loci that could be of interest for further research. By

260

performing fine mapping within these genetic loci we found and replicated two genetic variants in i.e. KCNH7,

261

PTPRT involved in glutamergic synaptic pathways by using recessive genetic association models. In addition, we

262

found a rare SNV in another synaptic gene, TBR1, for which the homozygous carriers are enriched in obese

263

phenotype. Taken together our study underline the additional benefits of model supervised analysis but also

264

seconds the involvement of the central nervous system in T2DM and obesity pathogenesis.
