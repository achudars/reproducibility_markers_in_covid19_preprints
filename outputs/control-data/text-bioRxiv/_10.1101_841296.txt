Introduction

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most severe primary brain cancer and represents

more than 15% of all brain tumors. Despite an aggressive treatment comprising surgical

resection and a combination of irradiation and chemotherapy (“Stupp protocol”), patient’s

survival post-diagnosis remains short with a median overall survival of 15 months [1]. The

lack of efficacy of the current treatments is mostly due to the intratumor heterogeneity at

diagnosis with the presence of multiple driver alterations [2], as well as to different tumor

cell types that exhibit various sensitivity to anti-cancer agents. Finally, it is also due to the

diffuse nature of GBM tumors that makes complete resection difficult. Another limitation for

the discovery of new improved therapeutic approaches

is the lack of a

relevant animal

model that extensively recapitulates current GBM patient disease and standard of care.

In

the

past

couple

of

years,

we

have

demonstrated

that

the

Unfolded

Protein

Response (UPR) plays an instrumental role in GBM development [3-8]. More precisely, we

have shown that IRE1, the most conserved UPR sensor, signals in tumor cells to remodel the

tumor microenvironment to favor tumor growth and most likely to alter the response to

treatment. We demonstrated that the IRE1/XBP1s (spliced XBP1) axis exhibits pro-oncogenic

properties

whereas

angiogenesis and tumor cell migration/invasion. This observation was then used to stratify

GBM patients, and we showed that survival of patients with tumors exhibiting high XBP1s

and low RIDD was significantly reduced compared to that of patients with low XBP1s and

high RIDD tumors [8]. These observations point toward the IRE1/XBP1s axis as a potentially

relevant therapeutic target which, when inhibited in XBP1s high tumors would i) slow down

tumor growth by impairing the pro-tumoral remodeling of the tumor stroma and ii) sensitize

tumor cells to the current treatments [8].

To further test the potential impact of the pharmacological targeting of IRE1/XBP1,

we propose to use an IRE1 RNase inhibitor, MKC8866 [9] which has been shown to be

effective in other cancer models [10], in preclinical models of GBM. However, the current

preclinical

GBM

models,

poorly

recapitulate

the

clinical

handling

of

GBM

patients

and

therefore would not be appropriate to test the therapeutic potential of IRE1 inhibition. In

study,

Stupp-like treatment applied to mice - Three days after the resection, we proceeded to apply
the Stupp protocol, consisting in three steps: (1) irradiation: the objective of radiotherapy is

to deliver a dose of ionizing radiation sufficient to ensure tumor control and to prevent

cancer recurrence. The effectiveness of anti-tumor treatment is based on a compromise

between the quality of tumor control and damage to healthy tissue, it is the benefit/risk

balance [12]. Mice were anesthetized, and placed in a lead dome to cover the entire animal

to prevent ionizing radiation from reaching the healthy tissues of the animals. A hole of a

few centimeters was made in the lead dome, corresponding to the resection area of the

tumor, in order to irradiate only the area of interest and protect the rest of the animal. The

Following the completion of Stupp-like procedure, described in Figure 2, mice were

sacrificed at first clinical signs. Brains were collected, fixed in paraformaldehyde (PFA 4%),

embedded in paraffin prior to immunohistochemical analysis using anti-vimentin antibodies.

This revealed the impact of surgery on tumor size and aggressiveness (Figure 3A), as well as

the effects of irradiation/TMZ treatment, which appeared to reduce tumor size and ability to

infiltrate surrounding parenchyma (Figure 3A, SIT). Mouse survival was then evaluated upon

these treatments (Figure 3B), and showed that while surgery did not have any significant

impact, Stupp-like treatment doubled mouse survival, thereby recapitulating observations

made in patients following this protocol. Moreover, we analyzed the impact of surgery on

was

evaluated

post

implantation and revealed that local IRE1 inhibition did not significantly (neither positively

nor negatively) modify mouse survival following resection (Figure S1). As we initially showed

that IRE1 signaling and more particularly the IRE1/XBP1s axis contributed to the remodeling

of the tumor stroma, we then sought to evaluate how the intra-operative application of the

IRE1 RNase inhibitor

impacted

on tumor characteristics.

To this end,

we

first evaluated

tumor structures at sacrifice using H&E staining (Figure S1B). This showed that although the

fibrin microgels appeared to exhibit a controlled tumor development (compared to non-

resected tumors), implantation of the Pangen sponges did not modify (rather amplified)

tumor development. The H&E analysis did not allow the characterization of other tumor

properties. Collectively, implantation of the devices containing the IRE1 inhibitor did not

Following

these

observations, we decided to abandon the “sponge” approach as it was estimated very toxic.

Moreover, the Pangen sponge was outperformed by the fibrin/collagen microgels regarding

specific controlled release of the drug. As a consequence, we have since focused only on the

fibrin/collagen gels and kept working with MKC8866 as this compound produced minimal

toxicity (not shown).

UPR branches IRE1, PERK and ATF6 also appeared to be altered in response to TMZ (Figure

response of these cells to different stressors, we evaluated the impact IRE1 RNase inhibition

on cell sensitivity to TMZ. To do so, TMZ IC50 was determined for GL261 and evaluated to

range to 800

μM (Figure 4E), and did not vary upon combined radiation. Remarkably, GL261

cells’ sensitivity to TMZ was increased upon treatment with MKC8866, phenomenon further

amplified with combined irradiation (Figure 4E). These results suggest that TMZ-induced

blocked by MKC8866, decrease the cell ability to cope with TMZ treatment. Consequently,

these data suggest that combining Stupp treatment with MKC8866 might be an interesting

approach to enhance treatment efficacy.

To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the combination of MKC8866 with Stupp-like

treatment using the fibrin-collagen gel plug as delivery tool. Surgery and drug implant were

carried out and the first line of treatment including radiation/chemotherapy was done in the

previous series of experiments (Figure 5A). Mouse survival was evaluated and brains were

collected as sacrifice. In the first instance we evaluated the impact of MKC8866, Stupp-like

treatment and combined therapy on tumor morphology at sacrifice. The new plugs of 2 mm

were appropriate in terms of size and conformation, they adjusted perfectly to the resection

cavity. Our latest results show that tumors developing in the presence of the MKC8866

containing plug and upon Stupp treatment present a totally different phenotype from those

developing

under

treatment

alone.

This

phenotype

corresponds

to

tumors with tumor escape significantly delayed (Figure 5B). Furthermore, when necrosis was

measured in tumors collected at sacrifice (H&E staining), we observed that the combination

of Stupp treatment and MKC8866 yielded much important necrosis, reflecting treatment

efficacy (Figure 5C). At last, we tested whether combined MKC8866 and Stupp treatment

impacted on mouse survival. This allowed us to establish survival curves (Figure 5D) that

demonstrate the positive impact of MKC8866 contained fibrin/collagen graft (1-2

μl) etither

μM (Figure 5D, green) or 100 μM (Figure 5D, orange) concentration on the efficiency

of Stupp treatment. We found that MKC8866 yielded a significant increase of mice survival

(of about 20%) compared to Stupp alone however with no significant impact of the drug

concentration used in the gel (Figure 5D) whereas it was observable in cell culture (Figure

S2). This suggested that the main limitation in our experimental design was the capacity of

the fibrin/collagen gel to control the delivery of the drug over time. Collectively, our results

show that IRE1 RNase inhibition might represent an appealing approach to enhance the

efficiency of current treatments towards GBM and that further work is needed to improve

drug delivery to the tumor site.

Discussion

Herein, we established a novel murine preclinical model of GBM that recapitulates standard

therapy for human patients. This model includes surgical resection of the tumor and Stupp-

like treatment combining irradiation and TMZ-based chemotherapy. Our model relies on the

use of GL261 cells that exhibit a genome harboring the majority, if not all mutations, driving

the glioblastomagenesis. These mutations and/or copy number variations were observed in

genes involved in the 3 main pathways affected in GBM (the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK),

P53, RB1 pathways, Figure 1 [14]). Furthermore, GBM related genes, harboring one SNV in

GL261 and two DNA copies (Tables S1-S3) had variable mutation allele frequency (MAF)

values ranking between 6 and 100%. This MAF distribution strongly suggests that multiple

different

clones

compose

the

parental

GL261

line

(up

to

5).

Altogether

these

GL261

characteristics recapitulate molecular features observed for primary GBM at diagnostic with

the presence of multiple drivers and/or multiple GBM clones [2]. Therefore, this cell line very

likely constitutes a valuable GBM model for preclinical studies in mice.

The use of such model in the context of our discovery regarding the role of IRE1

signaling in GBM [15] has allowed us to test the impact of IRE1 pharmacological inhibition in

enhancing the efficacy of Stupp treatment as already demonstrated in other contexts, for

instance for the sensitization of Triple Negative Breast Cancers (TNBC) to paclitaxel therapy

[10, 16]. In contrast with the approaches carried out with TNBC which included systemic

injection of MKC8866 [10, 16], the available pharmacological inhibitors

did not pass the

blood brain barrier and as such we had to design a novel type of therapeutic strategy which

would allow the controlled release of the drug during Stupp treatments. As such, we took

advantage of the surgical step to use the peri-surgical implantation of a biocompatible graft

containing the drug (Figure S1). This was achieved by using a fibrin/collagen graft (1-2

corresponding to non-toxic concentrations in cell culture and in animals. The grafts were

implanted at the time of surgery and mice were then exposed to Stupp-like treatments. Both

macroscopic exploration, immunohistochemistry and Kaplan-Meier survival curves (Figure 5)

indicated that combination of MKC8866 with Stupp treatment enhanced its efficacy, leading

to increased necrosis within the tumor and to prolonged mouse survival.
