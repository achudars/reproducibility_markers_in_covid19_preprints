Abstract

29

During central nervous system (CNS) development, spatiotemporal gene

30

expression programs mediate specific lineage decisions to generate neuronal

31

and glial cell types from neural stem cells (NSCs). However, little is known

32

about the epigenetic landscape underlying these highly complex developmental

33

events. Here, we perform ChIP-seq on distinct subtypes of Drosophila FACS-

34

purified neural stem cells (NSCs) and their differentiated progeny to dissect the

35

epigenetic changes accompanying the major lineage decisions in vivo. By

36

analyzing active and repressive histone modifications, we show that stem cell

37

identity genes are silenced during differentiation by loss of their activating

38

marks and not via repressive histone modifications. Our analysis also uncovers

39

a new set of genes specifically required for altering lineage patterns in type II

40

neuroblasts, one of the two main Drosophila NSC identities. Finally, we

41

demonstrate that this subtype specification in NBs, unlike NSC differentiation,

42

requires Polycomb-group (PcG)-mediated repression.

Introduction

45

During development of the central nervous system (CNS), neural stem cells

46

(NSCs) divide asymmetrically to generate daughter cells with self-renewing

47

capacity but also complex neurogenic and gliogenic lineages. Regulation of this

48

process requires tightly and highly dynamic control of multiple cell fate

49

decisions. For cells to commit to their ultimate cell identity, spatiotemporal gene

50

expression programs are required. It is assumed that activation of lineage-

51

specific genes and silencing of stem cell genes is accompanied by changes in

52

chromatin states. How histone modifications change over time during

53

neurogenesis in vivo, however, is not very well described.

54

The Drosophila larval CNS has become a key model for the fundamental

55

mechanisms underlying brain development and chromatin states (Homem &

56

Knoblich, 2012). The larval CNS is populated by distinct types of NSCs (called

57

neuroblasts in Drosophila), which vary in abundance, neuronal output and

58

division mode. Together, these NBs give rise to the majority of the adult brain’s

59

neurons (Truman & Bate, 1988). The majority of the central brain NBs are of

60

Type I (NBIs). Each NBI gives rise to another NBI and a ganglion mother cell

61

(GMC), which divides once more to generate two differentiated neurons of glia.

62

Type II neuroblasts (NBIIs) instead are a rare subpopulation with only 8 NBII

63

per brain lobe (Fig. 1A) (Bello, Izergina, Caussinus, & Reichert, 2008; Boone &

64

Doe, 2008; Homem & Knoblich, 2012; Sousa-Nunes, Cheng, & Gould, 2010).

65

Unlike NBIs, NBIIs divide into one NBII and one transit-amplifying cell called

66

intermediate neural progenitors (INPs). They generate many more neurons,

67

because INPs continue to divide asymmetrically for 5-6 times, each time giving

68

rise to a GMC that divides into two neurons or glia cells. (Bello et al., 2008;

69

Boone & Doe, 2008; Homem & Knoblich, 2012). Other than lineage structure

70

and size, cell markers can also be used to differentiate NB subtypes. While

71

NBIs express both Asense (Ase) and Deadpan (Dpn) (Bowman et al., 2008),

72

NBIIs only express Dpn (Bello et al., 2008). During neurogenesis, both NB

73

subtypes divide asymmetrically to give rise to their respective progeny (Kang &

74

Reichert, 2014). Brain tumors form if the asymmetric segregation of cell fate

75

determinants during NB cell division is disrupted (Betschinger, Mechtler, &

76

Knoblich, 2006; Juergen A Knoblich, 2010). Among these determinants are the

77

TRIM-NHL protein Brain tumor (Brat) and the Notch inhibitor Numb (Arama,

78

Dickman, Kimchie, Shearn, & Lev, 2000; Betschinger et al., 2006; Bowman et

79

al., 2008; Jürgen A Knoblich, Jan, & Jan, 1995; Lee et al., 2006a; Lee,

80

Wilkinson, Siegrist, Wharton, & Doe, 2006b). While Brat-depletion results in the

81

generation of ectopic NBII-like tumor NBs (tNBs) at the expense of

82

differentiated brain cells (Bowman et al., 2008), simultaneous loss of Brat and

83

Numb causes the NBI-like tNBs to overproliferate (see Results).

84

In many cell types, transitions in chromatin states are regulated by the

85

evolutionary conserved Polycomb (PcG) and Trithorax (TrxG) group proteins.

86

PcG and TrxG have emerged as antagonistic regulators that silence or activate

87

gene expression, respectively (Kingston & Tamkun, 2014; Levine et al., 2002;

88

Schuettengruber, Chourrout, Vervoort, Leblanc, & Cavalli, 2007). These

89

multimeric protein complexes regulate the transcriptional state of genes by

90

post-translationally modifying amino acid residues of histone tails (Kingston &

91

Tamkun, 2014; Levine, King, & Kingston, 2004). PcG proteins exert a

92

repressive activity via two main complexes, the Polycomb repressive

93

complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2). Although PRC1 and PRC2 can exist in

94

various compositions and associate with context-specific accessory proteins,

95

both PRC1 and PRC2 have been shown to contain a specific core set of

96

proteins including subunits with catalytic activity (Bracken, Dietrich, Pasini,

97

Hansen, & Helin, 2006; Simon & Kingston, 2009). Within PRC2, Enhancer of

98

zeste (E(z) in Drosophila, EZH1/2 in mammals) catalyzes the trimethylation of

99

lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K27me3) (Cao & Zhang, 2004). H3K27me3 is

100

recognized by PRC1, which in turn includes the histone 2A ubiquityltransferase

101

Sce (RING1A/B in mammals) (de Napoles et al., 2004). Histone modifications

102

associated with active transcription are deposited by TrxG proteins (Kassis,

103

Kennison, & Tamkun, 2017), which counteract repressive histone acetylation

104

or methylation marks, in particular by trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone 3 at

105

active promoters (Byrd & Shearn, 2003; Dou et al., 2005; Petruk et al., 2001)

106

(Kim et al., 2005).

107

Although well-known for their role in long-term transcriptional memory, PcG and

108

TrxG complexes are highly dynamic during development and thus facilitate

109

cellular plasticity (Kwong et al., 2008; Negre et al., 2006). In the last decade, it

110

has been shown that PcG and TrxG complexes are crucial to ensure correct

111

neurogenesis in mammals (Hirabayashi et al., 2009; Lim et al., 2009; Pereira

112

et al., 2010) as well as in Drosophila (Bello, Holbro, & Reichert, 2007; Touma,

113

Weckerle, & Cleary, 2012). Despite the strength of genetic in vivo experiments,

114

however, global analysis of the histone modifications underlying their function,

115

and therefore target genes, has mainly been performed in vitro. This constitutes

116

a real knowledge-gap as recent studies demonstrated that the chromatin states

117

may vary significantly between in vivo tissues and their related in vitro cell lines,

118

mainly due to culture conditions (R. Xie et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2013). Given

119

also that epigenetic changes are highly context – and developmental time-

120

dependent, providing in vivo datasets to investigate chromatin states of different

121

cell types in complex tissues will increase our understanding of how the

122

epigenetic landscape dynamically defines cellular states.

123

In recent years, in vivo studies made use of Drosophila to shed light on the

124

dynamics of chromatin state changes during embryonic neural differentiation

125

(Ye et al., 2016) and during larval stages (Aughey, Estacio-Gómez, Thomson,

126

Yin, & Southall, 2018; Marshall & Brand, 2017). Profiling the binding of

127

chromatin remodelers has highlighted the plasticity of chromatin states during

128

differentiation (Marshall & Brand, 2017). Although binding of chromatin factors

129

is associated with active or repressive chromatin, binding does not necessarily

130

reflect downstream histone modifications. For example, the histone marks can

131

change drastically between parasegments of the Drosophila embryo while the

132

occupancy of PcG proteins remains unchanged (Bowman et al., 2014). Thus,

133

investigating the dynamics of chromatin states based on chromatin marks is

134

crucial for understanding the functional specialization of cells during

135

development. Moreover, how PcG/TrxG complexes target genes on the

136

chromatin level between different subtypes of progenitor cells during neuronal

137

differentiation, or tumorigenic transformation has remained elusive.

138

Here, we use the Drosophila larval CNS to track in vivo changes of histone

139

modifications not only upon differentiation, but also between different

140

populations of neural stem cells and their tumorigenic counterparts. We

141

developed a FACS-based method to sort different cell types and perform ChIP-

142

Seq for the active histone mark, H3K4me3, and the repressive mark,

143

H3K27me3. Our FACS-based approach provides an in vivo dataset that reveals

144

dynamic histone modifications during neuronal differentiation. In particular, we

145

observed that self-renewal and cell division genes are repressed independently

146

of H3K27me3 levels. In contrast, we further show that H3K27me3-mediated

147

repression is crucial for silencing lineage-specific stem cell factors, including

148

known factors as wells as a new set of genes that are specific to NBIIs. Finally,

149

we present genetic evidence for the requirement of these new NBII-specific

150

factors for self-renewal and demonstrate the role of PcG complexes in defining

151

different subtypes of neural stem cells.

153

Profiling repressive and active histone modifications of neural stem cells

154

and neurons.

155

H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 are two major histone modifications associated with

156

TrxG-activated and PcG-repressed states, respectively. However, these

157

histone modifications have not yet been analyzed independently in distinct

158

subtypes of neural stem cells in Drosophila. To analyze H3K4me3 and

159

H3K27me3 histone marks in different brain cell types by ChIP-Seq, we

160

combined genetic labeling with a protocol for generating sequencing libraries

161

from picogram quantities of DNA (Bowman et al., 2014). The NB subtype-

162

specific GAL4 drivers ase-GAL4 (NBI lineage-specific) and wor-GAL4, ase-

163

GAL80 (NBII lineage-specific), allowed us to preferentially label distinct NB

164

lineages with nuclear-localized fluorophores (stinger::GFP or RFP). Indeed,

165

GFP expressed by ase-GAL4 exclusively labeled NBI lineages (positive for both

166

Dpn and Ase) and was not expressed in NBIIs (only Dpn+) (Fig. 1B). To amplify

167

the production of rare NBIIs and at the same time generate tumor NBs (tNBs),

168

RNAi constructs against the cell fate determinants brat and numb, were

169

expressed using the mentioned driver lines. Depletion of brat in larval brains

170

with a NBII-specific driver resulted in the overproliferation of NBII-like tNBs,

171

evident by an increase in Dpn+, Ase- cells (Fig. 1C). In contrast, simultaneously

172

depleting numb and brat by an NBI-specific driver resulted in overgrowth of

173

(Dpn+, Ase+) NBI-like tNBs (Fig. 1B). Therefore, this strategy allowed us to

174

generate fluorescently labeled distinct NB cell types and neurons.

175

Besides central brain NB lineages, the larval brain consists of embryonic

176

neurons, mushroom body neuroblasts and cells of the optic lobes. To avoid

177

impurities from these structures NBI, neurons and tNBs were isolated according

178

to fluorescence intensity and cell size by flow cytometry (Berger et al., 2012;

179

Harzer, Berger, Conder, Schmauss, & Knoblich, 2013). Purified cell populations

180

were then analyzed by ChIP-seq for H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 histone

181

modifications (Fig. 1D).

182

The H3K4me3 signal peaked around transcriptional start sites (TSSs), whereas

183

the H3K27me3 signal occurred in broad domains covering gene bodies. For

184

example, in all cell types the ubiquitously expressed gene RNA polymerase II

185

subunit 215kDa contained a H3K4me3 peak at the TSS which was devoid of

186

H3K27me3 signal (Fig. S1A). In contrast, the gene caudal showed no

187

H3K4me3 peak, but instead high H3K27me3 levels over the gene body (Fig.

188

S1B). This is in accordance with the fact that the function of caudal is mostly

189

restricted to the larval digestive system. Moreover, caudal is not expressed in

190

the larval CNS (modENCODE data and (Berger et al., 2012)) and has been

191

shown to inhibit neuroblast specification upon misexpression (Birkholz, Vef,

192

Rogulja-Ortmann, Berger, & Technau, 2013).

193
194

Self-renewal and cell cycle genes are repressed during differentiation in

195

a H3K27me3-independent manner

196

To investigate changes in the epigenetic landscape during neurogenesis, we

197

collected NBIs and neurons as described above in duplicates. We subtracted

198

the individual inputs from their respective samples to generate coverage tracks.

199

The read counts for H3K27me3 localization were analyzed over the whole gene

200

body, but the reads for H3K4me3 were counted 500 bp downstream of the TSS.

201

From this data, regions with differential signals were identified between different

202

cell types. Finally, we performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis

203

on differentially marked genes in NBIs and neurons (Fig. 2A) identifying five

204

distinct groups of genes. Three clusters were dependent on H3K27me3-

205

mediated repression. Cluster 1 showed a decreased H3K27me3 signal upon

206

differentiation, while cluster 3 showed an increased H3K27me3 signal in

207

neurons. These clusters were not enriched for genes of a particular pathway or

208

biological process when analyzed with gene ontology enrichment analysis.

209

Another example of H3K27me3-mediated repression was cluster 5. While

210

cluster 1 and 3 showed changes in H3K27 signal and no or mild changes in

211

H3K4me3, genes in cluster 5 (22 genes) showed a drastic switch from a

212

H3K4me3+ H3K27me3- to a H3K4me3- H3K27me3+ chromatin state upon

213

differentiation. Cluster 5 included the lncRNAs cherub, pncR002:3R and sphinx

214

and transcription factors nab and vvl (Fig. 2B).

215

The other two clusters (Cluster 2 and 4) were mainly dependent on changes in

216

H3K4me3 signal. Cluster 2 showed an increase in H3K4me3 levels in neurons,

217

while cluster 4 contained a large number of 318 genes and was characterized

218

by a loss of H3K4me3 upon differentiation. These gene loci had either a small

219

increase in H3K27me3 or were completely devoid of both marks (H3K4me3

220

and H3K27me3) in neurons (Fig. 2A, C, D). Gene ontology enrichment analysis

221

(Supplement table 1) showed that cluster 4 genes were enriched for genes

222

involved in self-renewal (e.g. stem cell proliferation p=0,002) and mitosis-

223

related processes (e.g. DNA replication p=3,04E-21), which are both processes

224

that cease upon differentiation. In support of this finding, protein complexes

225

essential for cell division were enriched in cluster 4 (Fig. 2E), whereas bona

226

fide NB self-renewal transcription factors such as vfl, klu, and dpn as well as

227

asymmetric cell division regulators (G𝛼i, mud, insc, bora) appeared in cluster

228

5. This suggests that during differentiation stem cell-promoting genes lack a

229

H3K27me3 mark and that their repression could be mediated through

230

mechanisms independent of PcG. This result is corroborated by previous data

231

indicating that the genes mira, CycE, stg and dpn are enriched in HP1-

232

associated chromatin in Drosophila neurons (Marshall & Brand, 2017).

233

Thus, these data suggest that a small group of genes is controlled by

234

H3K27me3-repression upon differentiation, whereas most stem cell–related

235

genes are turned off via an additional mechanism, potentially involving HP1

236

enrichment. This result is surprising considering H3K27me3 datasets indicate

237

spreading of PcG-repressed regions upon neural differentiation in mammals

238

(Södersten et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2013) and suggests that different strategies

239

of epigenetic control of neurogenesis have been established across evolution.

240
241

Subtype-specific neuroblast genes are controlled by TrxG and PcG

242

Next, we wanted to address whether alterations of histone modifications can be

243

observed between different types of NB lineages. To this end, we made use of

244

tNBs which are of a different origin. RNAi of both brat and numb induced tumors

245

made of NBIs while the depletion brat alone initiates tumors consisting of NBIIs

246

(Fig. 1B-C). We reasoned that features occurring in NBII-like tNBs but absent

247

in NBI-like tNBs would likely be specific to NBII lineages rather than due to

248

tumorigenesis. We performed hierarchical clustering analysis between NBIs,

249

NBI-like tNBs and NBII-like tNBs as described above and identified two NBII-

250

specific sets of genes (Fig. 3A and Fig. S2). The first cluster of genes showed

251

a decrease in H3K4me3 in NBII-like tNBIIs compared to NBIs and no or only

252

mild changes when compared to NBI-like tNBIs (NBII cluster1). Moreover, these

253

loci showed no or only modest increases in H3K27me3. As a key example,

254

among this set of genes, we found the NBI-specific transcription factor asense,

255

which showed clear H3K4me3 signals in NBI and brat numb depleted NBI-like

256

tNBs but no signal in NBII-like tNBs (Fig. S3A).

257

In the second gene cluster (NBII cluster 2), NBII-like tNBIIs showed increased

258

H3K4me3 signal and lower H3K27me3 occupancy. Interestingly, previous

259

genetic evidence has suggested a role of trithorax in maintaining different

260

subtypes of neuroblast lineages. In particular, the two loci buttonhead and Sp1

261

are required to specify NBII from neuroectoderm (Álvarez & Díaz-Benjumea,

262

2018) and to maintain NBII lineages (Komori, Xiao, Janssens, Dou, & Lee,

263

2014; Y. Xie et al., 2014). Indeed, both genes are H3K4me3 positive in NBII-

264

like tNBIIs and have reduced intensity of H3K27me3 signal in NBI-derived

265

numb tumors as well as NBIs (Fig. 3B). Our clustering identified additional

266

genes with a similar pattern (Fig. 3A). Two of these H3K4me3 positive NBII-like

267

NBII-specific genes were the homeodomain transcription factor Distal-less (Dll)

268

and the transcriptional coactivator eyes absent (eya). We decided to further

269

focus on and characterize the contribution of these two genes in NBII

270

specification as previous work showed that Dll enhancer was active in NBII

271

lineages (Izergina, Balmer, Bello, & Reichert, 2009) and eya was mainly

272

expressed in NBIIs (which we confirmed by immunostaining (Fig. 3D)). Dll-or

273

eya-depleted brains resulted in smaller NBII cells (Fig. 3E and Fig. S2B) with a

274

reduced number of INPs (Fig. 3F), which indicates reduced stemness (Song &

275

Lu, 2011; Wissel et al., 2018). In contrast, NBI lineages showed normal NB

276

growth and unaffected GMC numbers (Fig. 3G and Fig. S2C). Thus, our data

277

indicate that these two genes are required to maintain NBII lineages. This would

278

further suggest that NB subtype-specific genes are regulated by PcG and TrxG.

279

Finally, tNB-specific changes were mostly H3K4me3 changes (reduction in tNB

280

cluster 1 and gain in tNB cluster 2+3) (Fig. 3A and Fig. S2) while only minor

281

changes were observed for H3K27me3. This suggests that tumor specific

282

changes are mediated by TrxG proteins rather than PcG.

283
284

PRC 1 and 2 are required for neuroblast maintenance

285

Our data suggest that both TrxG and PcG complexes play an important role in

286

maintaining NBI and NBII identities. TrxG-dependent maintenance of NBII

287

identity was shown to rely on the target genes buttonhead and Sp1 (Álvarez &

288

Díaz-Benjumea, 2018; Komori et al., 2014). By contrast, the role of PcG in NB-

289

subtype specification, besides HOX gene repression, remains largely

290

unexplored. During brain development, loss of PcG repression leads to ectopic

291

expression of HOX genes, which in turn induces apoptosis and depletion of

292

both type I and type II NBs (Bello et al., 2007). In accordance with these

293

previous findings, our ChIP-seq data revealed high levels of H3K27me3 at the

294

two HOX gene clusters Antennapedia and Bithorax complex in both NBIs and

295

NBIIs (Fig. S4A).

296

To investigate whether PRC-mediated repression is only required to prevent

297

HOX gene-induced apoptosis or plays a broader role in neurogenesis, we

298

blocked apoptosis by expressing the baculovirus caspase inhibitor gene P35.

299

To this end, RNAi constructs against components of PRC2 (E(z), Su(z)12) or

300

PRC1 (Sce) were expressed in NBs using the general NB driver line insc-GAL4,

301

which resulted in a great decrease in NBI and NBII cell numbers (Fig. 4A). Upon

302

p35 expression in a PcG-depleted background, GFP+ NB lineages could be

303

restored (Fig. 4B) as previously reported (Bello et al., 2007).

304

Although RNAi constructs were expressed with the same driver line in NBIs and

305

NBIIs, blocking apoptosis in PRC2-depleted lineages restored NBI but not NBII

306

cell numbers (Fig. 4C, D). In contrast, the number of NBs in PRC1-depleted

307

brains was restored, suggesting PRC1, unlike PRC2, seem to only target the

308

HOX genes and therefore prevent apoptosis of NBs (Fig. 4D). However, these

309

restored NBIIs still exhibited a smaller cell size (Fig. 4F) than their control NBIIs.

310

These results indicate that in addition to its function as anti-apoptotic in both

311

type I and type II NB, that NBIIs require PRC2 is required specifically in NBIIs

312

to maintain self-renewal potential. These data therefore suggest that PcG-

313

dependent repression targets more genes in addition to the HOX genes to

314

maintain NBII.

315
316

PcG proteins prevent premature NB differentiation

317

Although the number of NBIs was restored in apoptosis-inhibited PcG-depleted

318

conditions, the NBI cell size was reduced (Fig. 4E). NBs must maintain a certain

319

growth rate to maintain their self-renewal potential and prevent differentiation

320

(Song & Lu, 2011). We therefore analyzed these apoptosis-inhibited NBIs and

321

their self-renewal potential. RNAi constructs against PRC1 and PRC2

322

components were expressed together with P35, and NBs were analyzed at 6h

323

after pupal formation (APF), timepoint at which NB start to exit proliferation (Fig.

324

S4B). While the number of NBI in both PRC1- and PRC2-depleted brains were

325

restored in third instar larval brains upon P35 expression, NB numbers were

326

significantly decreased at 6h APF along with the fact that the diameter of the

327

remaining ones was significantly lower compared to control (Fig. S4C, D).

328

Altogether, these data show that even though the number of NBs were restored

329

in apoptosis-inhibited, PRC-depleted lineages, these NBs fail to maintain their

330

self-renewal potential as reported by their smaller size and early differentiation

331

compared to their wild-type counterparts. These results altogether indicate that

332

PcG proteins are required to maintain stemness both in type I and type II NBs

333

but with different sensitivities.

334

To address the physiological consequences of premature NB differentiation, we

335

analyzed the viability of PcG-depleted flies. RNAi-mediated knockdown of PcG

336

proteins with and without p35 expression using insc-GAL4, led to lethality

337

during development (data not shown). This observation further confirms our

338

previous results that neurogenesis of NBI lineages is not fully restored.

339

However, this approach suffers from the caveat that the insc promotor is active

340

in some cells of the larval gut and salivary glands. To exclude that lethality could

341

originate from abnormal development of other tissues, we next used a brain-

342

restricted NBI lineage-specific driver line ase-GAL4. Similar to insc-Gal4, ase-

343

Gal4-mediated loss of PcG proteins led to a decline in NBI numbers and size,

344

which could be rescued by blocking apoptosis (Fig. S5A, B). These phenotypes

345

were nonetheless weaker, which we could explain by the strength of insc-Gal4,

346

is higher expressed than ase in NBIs (Berger et al., 2012). However,

347

immunostainings could confirm that PcG RNAi upon p35 rescue NBI lineages

348

using ase-GAL4 still showed a significant decrease in H3K27me3 signal (Fig.

349

S5C). Therefore, these results further confirm that PcG promotes self-renewal

350

beyond preventing apoptosis also in NBI.

351

When PcG proteins were depleted with ase-GAL4 driven RNAi during NBI

352

development, the majority of eggs failed to develop into adult flies (Fig. S5D).

353

Between 3-18% of laid eggs hatched, but flies showed neurological

354

abnormalities, and became stuck in the fly food leading to death. Similarly,

355

preventing apoptosis in these PcG knockdown backgrounds did not rescue the

356

number of viable flies (Fig. S5D). Therefore, NBIs and NBIIs depend on PcG

357

proteins for proper neuron production, although at different sensitivities. In

358

summary, these results suggest that PRC1 and 2 maintain NB neurogenesis by

359

silencing genes that induce apoptosis and genes whose expression leads to

360

differentiation.

Discussion

363

We provide a resource of histone modification datasets for different types of

364

neural stem cells and their differentiated progeny. In combination with

365

chromatin accessibility (Aughey et al., 2018) and binding maps of chromatin

366

remodelers (Marshall & Brand, 2017) of Drosophila brain cells, we hope that

367

our dataset will serve as an useful community resource. We show that during

368

differentiation, stem cell identity genes are silenced in a PcG-independent

369

manner, which supports previous findings showing that these genes are

370

silenced through HP1 enriched chromatin (Marshall & Brand, 2017).

371

Additionally, PcG-mediated silencing is unlikely to instruct the stepwise

372

inactivation of stem cell genes during differentiation as loss of H3K27me3 did

373

not induce ectopic NBs.

374

Here, we take advantage of in vivo genetic labeling to investigate chromatin

375

dynamics of different NB subtypes. As the type II NBs are very lowly abundant,

376

we used tumor NBs of type I and type II origins as a proxy in order to obtain

377

enough material to be able to compare these two cell types. We further

378

validated each change observed by comparing tumor to healthy type I NBs and

379

excluded artifacts due to the tumorigenic state of the cells. Our data show that

380

both TrxG and PcG are required to establish NBII identity. We identify a set of

381

NBII-specific genes, including previously identified btd (Komori et al., 2014) and

382

Sp1 (Álvarez & Díaz-Benjumea, 2018). We further identified Dll and eya which

383

are specifically required for NBII maintenance. It has been previously described

384

that btd acts as an activator of Dll in the development of the ventral imaginal

385

discs (Estella, Rieckhof, Calleja, & Morata, 2003). This suggests that in NBII-

386

identity specification the Trithorax-target btd could act together with Dll and eya.

387

Such a mechanism would explain why the loss of btd causes a distinct

388

phenotype compared to the loss of Dll and eya. Interestingly, a NBI to NBII

389

conversion is observed only in 18% of NBIs ectopically over-expressing btd

390

indicating that either cofactors are missing or that the chromatin of btd targets

391

is inaccessible (Komori et al., 2014). Our data of NB subtype-specific genes

392

being characterized by H3K27me3 repressive chromatin favor the latter.

393

Therefore, as opposed to TrxG-activated stem cell and mitosis genes, the

394

repression of NBII-specific genes is ensured by PcG-mediated H3K27me3

395

histone modifications suggesting that Polycomb plays a role in defining the

396

diversity of neural stem cell lineages. Moreover, our data indicates that PcG

397

repression is required not only for the silencing of HOX genes but also for the

398

self-renewal capacity of NBs. Unlike TrxG (Komori et al., 2014), the loss of

399

catalytic subunits of PcG complexes did not convert NBIIs to NBIs or vice versa.

400

This suggests that NB subtype-specification cannot be explained solely by an

401

absence of repression but requires a further activation mechanism. Strikingly,

402

loss of PcG complexes caused a significant decrease in the numbers of NBs.

403

Interestingly, across all the cell types, developmental genes such as cad, eve,

404

peb, scr, and slp1, as well as genes involved in embryonic NB temporal

405

patterning (hb, kr, pdm, cas and grh), are heavily marked with H3K27me3. It is

406

therefore possible that PcG-mediated repression is required to silence these

407

developmentally crucial genes in addition to the HOX genes. Thus, the

408

observed reduction in NB stemness might be caused by the de-repression of

409

these genes.

410

Besides an overall decreased NB maintenance, we observed increased

411

sensitivity of NBII lineages upon reduction of PRC2 activity. Interestingly, opa

412

and ham, two previously described temporal switch genes in NBII lineages

413

(Abdusselamoglu, Eroglu, Burkard, & Knoblich, 2019), are also enriched with

414

H3K27me3 in NBs. Ectopic expression of these genes limits self-renewal of

415

NBs and causes NBs to disappear (Abdusselamoglu et al., 2019; Eroglu et al.,

416

2014). In the future, investigating the downstream targets of PcG in different

417

NB subtypes could reveal the underlying mechanisms of subtype-specification.

418

In conclusion, our data provide a useful resource to investigate how chromatin

419

state dynamics orchestrate the diversity and correct progression of neural stem

420

cell lineages.

Preparation of soluble chromatin

461

50000 sorted cells of interest were pelleted by centrifuging at 3000 rpm for 10

462

min. The cell pellet was resuspended in complete media. Fixation was

463

performed with formaldehyde (final concentration 1%) for 5 min at room

464

temperature. After quenching with glycine (final concentration 125 mM) for 3

465

min at room temperature, cells were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min and the

466

supernatant was discarded. Cells then were resuspended in 100 µl 1X PBS

467

with CaCl2 (final concentration: 1mM) and TritonX100 (final concentration:

468

0.1%) and incubated with 5 Units micrococcal nuclease (Worthington

469

Biochemical, LS004798) at 37°C for 3 min. After incubation, the sample was

470

immediately transferred on ice and 2.5 µl 0.5 M EDTA, 6.25 µl 0.2 M EGTA and

471

1.25 µl 1X PBS were added in order to stop the reaction. After adjusting the

472

sample volume to 300 µl with 1X PBS and sonication was performed with a

473

microtip sonicator (OmniZRuptor 250, Omni International; microtip, power

474

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation

479

The volume of thawed chromatin samples was adjusted to 500 µl with 50 µl

480

10X lysis buffer (1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH8, 0.1% Na-Deoxycholate,

481

0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine, 1% TritonX100), 140 µl water and 10 µl of 50X

482

complete protease inhibitor. After 5min incubation on ice, samples were spun

483

down at maximum speed for 10 min at 4°C. While supernatant was transferred

484

to fresh tubes, 5 µl was saved as input sample (1%) at 4°C. Samples were

485

incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. And then, incubated with

486

10 µl Dynabeads Protein A for 1 hour at 4°C. After 6 washes with lysis buffer

487

containing 100 mM NaCl and 1% TritonX100, ChIP DNA was eluted twice with

488

125 µl fresh elution buffer (0.2% SDS, 0.1M NaHCO3, 5 mM DTT) at 65°C for

489

10 min. The input DNA volume was adjusted to 250 µl with elution buffer. To

490

achieve reversal of crosslinking, 1 M Tris-HCl (10 mM final concentration) and

491

500 mM EDTA (2 mM final concentration) were added to samples. Antibodies

492

used for ChIP were: H3K27me3 (Active Motif, 39155) and H3K4me3 (Millipore

493

07-473).

494

Library construction

495

Library construction was performed as previously described (Bowman et al.,

496

2013). In short, after the ChIP sample volume was adjusted to 37.5 µl, end

497

polishing reaction (50 µl) was performed by incubating the sample with 1X T4

498

ligase buffer (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA), 0.4 mM dNTPs, 7.5U T4 Polymerase

499

(NEB), 2.5U Klenow polymerase (NEB), 25U polynucleotide kinase for 30 min

500

at 20°C in a thermocycler. To clean-up the samples, Solid Phase Reversible

501

Immobilization (SPRI) beads (Agencourt AMPure XP, Beckman Coulter) were

502

used at a 1.8X beads ratio. Once, DNA was eluted with 16.5 µl water, A-tailing

503

reaction (25 µl) was performed. To do so, 16 µl sample with 1X NEB buffer 2,

504

0.2 mM dATP, 7.5U Klenow 3’-5’ exo minus (NEB) were incubated for 30 min

505

at 37°C. SPRI cleanup was performed with 1.8X beads ratio and DNA was

506

eluted with 9.5 µl of water. Adapter ligation reaction (25 µl) was performed by

507

incubating 9 µl of sample with 1X rapid T4 ligase buffer (Enzymatics, Beverly,

508

509

(Enzymatics) for 15 min at room temperature. SPRI cleanup was performed

510

once again with 1.6X beads ratio and DNA was eluted with 10.5 µl water.

511

Finally, library amplification was performed by setting up a PCR reaction (50 µl)

512

with 1X Phusion HF master mix (NEB), 0.2 uM universal primer, 0.2 uM

513

barcoded primer, 1X SYBR Green I (Invitrogen), and 0.5 µl Rox (USB). Then,

514

PCR reaction was performed using an Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-

515

Time PCR System. Program used was as followed: an initial denaturing for 30

516

seconds at 98°C, followed by multiple cycles of 10 seconds denaturation at

517

98°C, 20 seconds annealing at 64°C, and 45 seconds extension at 72°C.

518

Reactions were terminated at the end of the extension phase, after SYBR green

519

reported reaction kinetics in the log phase for several cycles.
