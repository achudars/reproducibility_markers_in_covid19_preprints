Abstract
Bisulfite sequencing is widely used to detect 5mC and 5hmC at single base resolution. It is the most
accepted method for detecting these cytosine modifications, but it does have significant drawbacks.
DNA is frequently damaged resulting in fragmentation, loss of DNA and inherent biases introduced to
sequencing data. To overcome this, we developed a new method called Enzymatic Methyl-seq (EMseq). This method relies on two sets of enzymatic reactions. In the first reaction, TET2 and T4-bGT
convert 5mC and 5hmC into substrates that cannot be deaminated by APOBEC3A. In the second
reaction, APOBEC3A deaminates unmodified cytosines converting them to uracils. The protection of
5mC and 5hmC permits the discrimination of cytosines from 5mC and 5hmC. Over a range of DNA
inputs, the overall fraction of 5mC and 5hmC in EM-seq libraries was similar to bisulfite libraries.
However, libraries made using EM-seq outperformed bisulfite converted libraries in all specific
measures examined including coverage, duplication, sensitivity and nucleotide composition. EM-seq
libraries displayed even GC distribution, improved correlation across input amounts, increased
numbers of CpGs confidently assessed within genomic features, and improved the accuracy of
cytosine methylation calls in other contexts. Bisulfite sequencing is known to severely damage DNA
thus making library construction for lower DNA input very difficult. We show that EM-seq can be used
to make libraries using as little as 100 pg of DNA. These libraries maintain all of the previously
described advantages over bisulfite sequencing thus opening new avenues for research and clinical
applications. Even with challenging input material, EM-seq provides a method to detect methylation
state more reliably than WBGS.

Introduction
There are approximately 2.6 billion cytosines in the human genome, and when both DNA strands are
considered, 56 million of those are followed by guanines (CpGs) [1]. In mammalian genomes, 70% to
80% of CpG are modified [2]. Cytosines modified at the 5th carbon position with a methyl group result in
5-methylcytosine (5mC) and oxidation of 5mC results in the formation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine
(5hmC). These modifications are important due to their impact on a wide range of biological processes
including gene expression and development [3]. Cytosine modifications are often linked with altered
gene expression, for example, methylated cytosines are often associated with transcriptional silencing
and are found at transcription start sites of repressed genes [4] or at repetitive DNA and transposons
[5]. Recently however, it has been reported that some genes can be activated by 3’ CpG island
methylation during development [6]. The ability to accurately detect 5mC and 5hmC can have profound
implications in understanding biological processes and in the diagnosis of diseases such as cancer.
To date, bisulfite sequencing has been the accepted standard for mapping the methylome. Sodium
bisulfite chemically modifies DNA and results in the conversion of unmethylated cytosines to uracils
(Supplemental Figure 1), however, 5mC and 5hmC are not converted under these reaction conditions
[7]. Sequencing distinguishes cytosines from these modified forms as they are read as thymines and
cytosines respectively [8]. Despite its widespread use amongst epigenetic researchers, bisulfite
sequencing also has significant drawbacks. It requires extreme temperatures and pH which causes
depyrimidination of DNA resulting in DNA degradation [9]. Furthermore, cytosines are damaged
disproportionately compared to 5mC or 5hmC. As a result, sequencing libraries made from converted
DNA have an unbalanced nucleotide composition. All of these issues taken together result in libraries
with reduced mapping rates and skewed GC bias plots, with a general under-representation of G- and Ccontaining dinucleotides and over-representation of AA-, AT- and TA-containing dinucleotides, when
compared to a non-converted genome [10]. Therefore, the damaged libraries do not adequately cover
the genome, and can include many gaps with little or no coverage. Increasing the sequencing depth of
these libraries may recover some missing information, but at steep sequencing costs.
These bisulfite library limitations have driven the development of new approaches for mapping 5mC and
5hmC, in combination or independently, for epigenome analysis. The methylation dependent restriction
enzymes (MDRE), MspJI and AbaSI were used to detect 5mC or 5hmC throughout the genome [11, 12]
and the use of AbaSI was further adapted for use in single cell 5hmC detection [13]. These methods also

have drawbacks that are related to the enzymatic properties of MDRE, such as variable target site
cleavage efficiency that results in potential biases within data sets. Another enzymatic method, ACE-seq,
uses two enzymes, T4-phage b glucosyltransferase (T4-bGT) and apolipoprotein B mRNA editing
enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3A (APOBEC3A). T4-bGT protects 5hmC against enzymatic
deamination by APOBEC3A. Cytosines and 5mCs are deaminated to uracil and thymine respectively and
then sequenced as thymines and 5hmCs are sequenced as cytosines. Comparing the reads to an
unconverted genome enables the identification of 5hmCs [14]. Recently, TET-assisted pyridine borane
sequencing (TAPS), which combines an enzymatic and chemical reaction to detect 5mC and 5hmC was
published [15].TET1 is used to oxidize 5mC and 5hmC to 5-carboxycytosine (5caC). The 5caCs are then
reduced to dihydrouracil (DHU) using pyridine borane. Subsequent PCR converts DHU to thymine,
enabling cytosines and the corresponding cytosine modifications to be differentiated. This method is
potentially hindered by the difficulty to prepare hyperactive TET1, which is required for complete
oxidization of 5mC to 5caC.
Currently, only destructive conversion methods are available to detect methylated cytosines. Here we
describe Enzymatic Methyl-seq (EM-seq), the first method to use only enzymatic reactions for single
base resolution mapping of 5mC/5hmC. Enzymatic Methyl-seq provides a much-needed alternative to
bisulfite sequencing. This method utilizes two enzymatic steps to differentiate between cytosine and its
modified forms, 5mC and 5hmC. The results described herein show that enzymatically converted DNA is
not fragmented in the same way as bisulfite converted DNA resulting in less biased sequencing data,
even genome coverage and increased detection of CpGs. The ability to obtain a complete methylome
has been incredibly difficult to achieve using bisulfite sequencing. EM-seq opens up new avenues to
investigate methylomes and gain a deeper understanding of development and disease.

RESULTS
Enzymatic Detection of 5mC and 5hmC on Genomic DNA
Enzymatic detection of 5mC and 5hmCs requires two sets of reactions. The first reaction uses ten-eleven
translocation dioxygenase 2 (TET2) and T4 phage b-glucosyltranferase (T4-bGT). TET2 is a Fe(II)/alphaketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase that catalyzes the oxidization of 5-methylcytosine to 5hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC), and 5-carboxycytosine (5caC) in three
consecutive steps with the concomitant formation of CO2 and succinate (Figure 1A). T4-bGT catalyzes
the glucosylation of the formed 5hmC as well as pre-existing genomic 5hmCs to 5-(β-

glucosyloxymethyl)cytosine (5gmC) (Figure 1B). These reactions protect 5mC and 5hmC against
deamination by APOBEC3A (Figure 1C, Figure 3C). This ensures that only cytosines are deaminated to
uracils, thus enabling the discrimination of cytosine from its methylated and hydroxymethylated forms.
The following sections characterize the catalytic actions of TET2, T4-bGT, and APOBEC3A.
Activity of TET2 and T4-bGT on 5mC and 5hmC
A previously described engineered form of mouse TET2, mTET2CDD [16] was used in the experiments
described throughout this paper and will be referred to as TET2. TET2 oxidizes greater than 99.5% of
5mC sites in NA12878 genomic DNA (gDNA) with up to ~85% being found in the 5caC oxidized form
(Figure 2A). The oxidation efficiency of TET2 on 5mC was examined in gDNA from different organisms
(Figure 2B) with 99% and higher of the 5mCs being efficiently oxidized in mouse and human gDNAs as
well as Arabidopsis thaliana, which has methylation occurring in CpG (24%), CHG (6.7%), and CHH (1.7%)
contexts [17]. Furthermore, TET2 oxidizes 96% of 5mC on Xanthomonas oryzae (bacteriophage XP12)
gDNA (Figure 2B). The 3% difference in the efficiency for the oxidation of XP12 gDNA compared to
mammalian or Arabidopsis gDNA is attributed to XP12 having 100% of its cytosines methylated and
therefore it is a far more difficult substrate for TET2 than mammalian or plant gDNA (for example only
1.5% methylation of cytosine content is found in human gDNA [18]). In addition to TET2, T4-bGT is an
important component of the enzymatic system that enables discrimination of 5mC/5hmC from
unmodified cytosine by glucosylating 5hmC and blocking APOBEC3A deamination. The results obtained
show that T4-bGT effectively glucosylates all 5hmC formed by TET2 to 5gmC. 5fC and 5caC are also
formed during the course of the TET2 reaction (Figure 2A). The combined action of TET2 and T4-bGT
ensures that 5mCs and 5hmCs are modified (Figure 2C) and are no longer substrates for APOBEC3A.
APOBEC3A substrate specificity
The deamination activity of an engineered form of APOBEC3A (NEB, Ipswich, MA) was determined using
single stranded oligonucleotides that share the same core sequence and contain a single cytosine or
methylated cytosine preceded by either thymine, uracil, guanine, adenine, or 5mC/cytosine
(Supplementary Table 1). In general, APOBEC3A favored cytosine containing oligonucleotides over their
5mC counterparts by 5-10 fold depending on the dinucleotide combination (Figure 3A, 3B).
Oligonucleotides with either thymine or uracil preceding cytosine or 5mC (Supplementary Table 1)
showed higher observed rate constants (kobs) for deamination than the rest of the substrates (Figure 3B).
However, by extending the reaction time, all substrates were fully deaminated.

In addition to APOBEC3A activity based on dinucleotide context, we tested more extensively the effect
of APOBEC3A on cytosine and several of its derivatives. Time course reactions confirm that both
cytosine and 5mC are deaminated efficiently by APOBEC3A with cytosine being approximately a 2-fold
better substrate (Figure 3C). On the other hand, only 50% of 5hmC substrate is deaminated by the
enzyme indicating that there could possibly be a product inhibition effect. 5fC is a very poor substrate
with minimal deamination detected whereas 5caC and 5gmC show no reactivity with APOBEC3A. These
data demonstrate that APOBEC3A selectively deaminates cytosine and 5mC and partially deaminates
5hmC while exhibits no activity on 5fC, 5caC, and 5gmC. Therefore, an enzymatic approach for detecting
5mC and 5hmC that uses TET2, T4-bGT, and APOBEC3A can be used for specific mapping of 5mC and
5hmC within the genome.
TET2 and APOBEC3A maintain DNA integrity
Sodium bisulfite treatment of DNA is destructive. We postulated that non-chemical conversion of DNA
to detect 5mC and 5hmC using the enzymes described above for oxidation, glucosylation and
deamination would maintain DNA integrity. To evaluate this, bisulfite and enzymatically converted
NA12878 gDNA was PCR amplified using primers that were designed to amplify amplicons ranging in size
from 543 bp to 2945 bp. Enzymatically converted DNA generated PCR products that ranged in size from
543 bp to 2945 bp (Supplemental Figure 3). Bisulfite converted DNA however, could only amplify up to
the 1181 bp PCR product. These data strongly indicate that DNA is more intact using enzymatic
conversion compared to chemical conversion and therefore can facilitate better detection of 5mC and
5hmC across the genome.
EM-seq is superior to bisulfite sequencing
Taking advantage of these initial studies into TET2, T4-bGT and APOBEC3A and their potential for
detection of 5mC and 5hmC while maintaining DNA integrity, Enzymatic Methyl-seq (EM-seq), a highthroughput sequencing method was developed. It incorporates the oxidation/glucosylation (TET2/ T4bGT) and deamination (APOBEC3A) steps with Illumina NEBNext library preparation to produce a
method that is robust, accurate and reproducible in the characterization of CpG modifications (Figure 4).
EM-seq and bisulfite libraries were made using 10, 50 and 200 ng of NA12878 gDNA. Compared to
bisulfite libraries, EM-seq libraries produce higher library yields using fewer PCR cycles for all DNA inputs
(Figure 5A) and they also contained fewer sequencing duplicates resulting in more useable reads (Figure

5B). This ultimately increases the effective coverage of the EM-seq libraries across the genome. In
addition, EM-seq libraries display a more normalized GC bias profile than bisulfite libraries which have
an AT rich and GC poor profile (Figure 5C). Combining this observation with its even dinucleotide profile,
(Supplementary Figure 4) provides compelling evidence that EM-seq libraries do not contain the same
biases of bisulfite sequencing. These basic metrics provide the basis for the subsequent CpG analysis and
the superior performance demonstrated by the EM-seq libraries.
EM-seq and bisulfite NA12878 libraries have similar cytosine methylation for all DNA inputs: CpG
methylation is around 52% while for CHG and CHH contexts methylation is <0.6% (Figure 6A). Two
internal controls, unmethylated lambda and CpG methylated pUC19, were included during library
construction. Cytosine methylation of unmethylated lambda DNA in CpG, CHG and CHH contexts were
<0.6% and for pUC19, CpG methylation was around 96% and <1.6% in the CHG and CHH contexts
(Supplemental Figure 5). Furthermore, CpG coverage and the percent CpG methylation per base are
represented by data analyzed using methylKit (Supplemental Figure 6). These data also demonstrate
increased coverage of CpGs by EM-seq as well as the expected percentage of methylation per base with
the majority of CpGs being found at 0% and 100%. Intermediate methylation is also more apparent with
EM-seq than bisulfite sequencing. We also compared methylation state between EM-seq and bisulfite
libraries at increasing coverage depths. There are 56 million CpGs in the human genome, considering
both DNA strands [1]. EM-seq detects approximately 54 million CpGs for the NA12878 genome at a
coverage depth of 1x for the 10, 50 and 200 ng inputs, however, bisulfite libraries cover at best
approximately 45 million CpGs for 50ng and 200ng inputs, but only 36 million CpGs for the 10ng input
(Figure 6B and 6C). Furthermore, when the sequencing depth is increased to 8x, CpGs covered by
bisulfite drop significantly compared to EM-seq. EM-seq libraries covered approximately 7 times more
CpGs at 10ng inputs and 2.2 time more CpGs at 200ng inputs (Figure 6B and 6C). However, at the
highest coverage depths >11x, bisulfite covers many more CpGs (Figure 6B). This is a result of the biased
nature of the bisulfite libraries showing excess coverage over AT rich regions and uneven genome
coverage (Figure 5B, Supplemental Figure 5). In order to compare the number of CpGs covered by EMseq and bisulfite sequencing, correlation analysis was performed at a 1x coverage depth. Correlations
between only EM-seq libraries across input amounts were consistently better compared to bisulfite
libraries (Figure 6D and 6E). Expansion of the correlations to include comparison of EM-seq and bisulfite
libraries (Supplemental Figure 7) also demonstrates similar patterns of correlations, with EM-seq

outperforming bisulfite libraries. Overall this data indicates that EM-seq does identify the same CpGs as
bisulfite as well as other CpGs that are only identified using EM-seq.
Increased CpG coverage in EM-seq libraries also translates into an increased number of CpGs identified
in genomic features (Figure 7). Interestingly, there is minimal shift in the pattern of genomic feature
representation as input amount varies between the 10 to 200 ng NA12878 gDNA inputs at 1x coverage
depth (Figure 7A). When compared to bisulfite libraries, at an 8x minimum coverage depth, EM-seq
libraries identified more CpGs for all of the examined genomic features. Consistent with more even
coverage observed in EM-seq libraries, most CpGs were observed in both methods or only in EM-seq.
Only a small number of CpG were covered only in WGBS libraries (Figure 7B and 7C). This phenomenon
was observed over a wide range of genomic features including repetitive elements, such as SINE or LINE
sequences, regulatory gene regions such as promoters, and transcription start sites (TSS). Additional
analysis of CpG coverage and their associated methylation within 2 kb of the TSS at 1x coverage depth
again shows that EM-seq libraries have a higher depth of coverage compared to bisulfite libraries for all
three DNA inputs (Figure 7D). Furthermore, increasing the minimal coverage depth to 8x demonstrates
not only higher coverage (7E), but that the EM-seq libraries more confidently represent the cytosine
methylation status (Figure 7F). Transcription start sites are expected to have limited CpG methylation.
EM-seq libraries display low levels of CpG methylation across the TSS. These results are not confined to
TSS. Coverage data for other genomic features and regulatory elements is similarly even. (Supplemental
Figure 8).
To further investigate whether EM-seq can be used to generate libraries using DNA inputs less than 10
ng, libraries were made using 100 pg to 10 ng NA12878 gDNA. 810 million total human reads were
sampled from low input libraries and relevant standard protocol libraries. Sequencing metrics are shown
in Supplemental Figure 9. These low input libraries displayed the same characteristics observed for 10 200 ng DNA libraries. Global methylation data for these libraries in the CpG, CHG and CHH contexts
(Figure 8A, Supplemental Figure 10) were similar to standard EM-seq libraries and all libraries had even
coverage across GC bias plots (Figure 8B). Due to additional PCR cycles, the number of unique reads
were reduced in the 100 pg and 500 pg libraries. This is reflected in the minimum coverage plot where
at 1x minimum coverage depth, approximately 24 million and 50 million CpGs were detected
respectively. It is worthwhile noting that for the 10 ng WGBS libraries, only 37 million CpGs were
detected, further demonstrating the increased ability of the EM-seq method to identify CpG methylation

state over WGBS. The 1 ng and 10 ng low input EM-seq libraries both covered 54 million CpGs, the same
number as identified using the standard protocol 10-200 ng libraries. Further analysis of CpG
methylation using correlation plots (Supplemental Figure 11), comparison of the number of genomic
features observed (Supplemental Figure 12), as well as heatmaps showing CpG coverage over specific
genomic features (Supplemental Figure 15) all indicate that the low-input libraries perform very well.
The 500 pg – 10 ng DNA inputs identified similar numbers of CpGs within the genomic features and the
100 pg input covered slightly fewer CpGs (Figure 8C, Supplemental Figure 12A), likely due to additional
PCR duplication. In addition, methylKit CpG methylation plots indicate that methylation is as expected
with the majority of CpGs falling into either 0% methylation or 100% methylation (Supplemental Figure
13). In order to further compare the low input EM-seq method to standard EM-seq libraries and WGBS
libraries, 10 ng inputs for both library types were downsampled to 810 million total human reads. In all
comparisons, from correlation (Supplemental Figure 11B), methylation distribution histograms
(Supplemental Figure 14) and genomic feature coverage (Supplemental Figures 12B, 15D, 15E) show
that the low input and standard EM-seq methods produced similar results, with higher number of CpGs
detected and more even coverage when compared to WGBS libraries.

Discussion
The most routinely applied method to detect 5mC and 5hmC in gDNA uses sodium bisulfite. Despite its
popularity, it does have drawbacks as it is known to damage DNA and is often associated with under- or
over- conversion of cytosines [19-21]. To overcome these issues, we developed EM-seq, an enzymatic
method to determine the methylation status of cytosines. This method relies on a trio of enzymes, and
their ability to optimally oxidize 5mC, glucosylate 5hmC, and deaminate unmodified cytosines to
thymines. The TET2 enzyme used in this study has robust activity converting 99.5% of 5mC to its
oxidative forms. Combining T4-bGT with TET2 effectively protects both 5mC and 5hmC, but not
cytosines, from subsequent deamination by APOBEC3A. This enzymatic manipulation of cytosine, 5mC
and 5hmC enables discrimination of 5mC/5hmC from cytosine in high-throughput sequence data. 5mC
and 5hmC are sequenced as cytosines whereas cytosines are sequenced as thymines. These nucleotide
classifications use the same designations associated with bisulfite sequencing which allows the EM-seq
method to seamlessly integrate with any preferred pipeline for bisulfite data including, Bismark and
bwa-meth. This is useful as it avoids the need to invest in the design of new analysis methods.

Analysis of EM-seq and bisulfite libraries shows that both methods have very similar global methylation,
but differences become noticeable with more locus-specific analysis. Traditional bisulfite sequencing
fragments DNA, making it hard to sequence all mappable CpGs in a genome whereas enzymatically
converted DNA does not suffer from the same fragmentation bias. More even genome coverage is
especially relevant to assessment of CpG methylation state. An important consideration in generating
methylomes is the amount of sequencing required to adequately cover all relevant sites in genome
adequately. Using the same number of reads, EM-seq libraries cover more CpGs across all genomic
features, so it is more economical than bisulfite libraries. EM-seq libraries can be longer (up to 350 bp,
not shown), have even GC bias profiles, have dinucleotide distributions similar to unconverted DNA
libraries, and can be used to generate long amplicons. Correlation analysis of CpG methylation illustrates
the reproducibility and superiority of EM-seq over bisulfite sequencing. It is becoming increasingly clear
that methylation plays important roles in cancer and embryonic development. Bisulfite induced damage
and uneven coverage have limited methylation assessment in these and other areas of research. EMseq’s increased coverage of CpGs, combined with the accuracy of methylation calls and flexible input
requirements opens up areas of research that were previously inaccessible.
The adaptation of enzymatic conversion for high-throughput sequencing enhances the study of the
whole methylome and permits DNA profiling from challenging samples. These include lower DNA inputs
as well as more diverse types of input material. Bisulfite sequencing has traditionally been difficult to
apply to cell free DNA and Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) DNA, primarily due to low inputs
and the presence of DNA damage. The EM-seq results herein demonstrate that the method can
overcome these challenges and provides researchers with the required tools to probe new avenues of
research. We demonstrated that EM-seq can be used with as little as 100 pg DNA and that the
methylation and CpG coverages follow similar trends as seen with 10-200 ng DNA inputs. In addition to
short-read sequencing, enzymatic conversion has the potential to be optimized for long read sequencing
using PacBio or Oxford Nanopore, as well as enzymatic equivalents for reduced representation bisulfite
libraries (RRBS), use of converted DNA to probe arrays, perform target enrichment and long-amplicon
sequencing. We envision most of the improvements to these applications coming from the intact nature
of the DNA that is associated with the enzymatic conversion found in EM-seq and resultant
improvements to coverage profiles.

New methods to capture the methylation or hydroxymethylation status of cytosines have recently been
reported. TET-assisted pyridine borane sequencing (TAPS) combines enzymatic oxidation of 5mC to 5caC
with a chemical deamination step of 5caC. The method can also be modified to detect 5hmC, by
glucosylating 5hmC to 5gmC prior to TET oxidation. Another method, ACE-seq relies solely on enzymes
to glucosylate 5hmC before deaminating both cytosine and 5mC to uracil but provides no information
on 5mC. Both of these methods have drawbacks. TAPS requires significant investment in the
development and validation of new analysis tools for data analysis, shows more biased coverage of CpG
Islands than EM-seq, and has not been shown to work with inputs below 1 ng of DNA [15]. Sequencing
data produced from EM-seq libraries can be analyzed using pipelines currently used for bisulfite data,
shows almost no coverage bias toward any specific genomic feature and can work with inputs as low as
100 pg of DNA. Combining ACE-seq data with bisulfite data can identify 5mCs, but this method is limited
by the quality of the bisulfite data. EM-seq detects both 5mC and 5hmC and the method can be
modified to only detect 5hmC, in a similar manner to that of ACE-seq to produce a more complete
picture of the methylome.
In stark contrast to bisulfite converted sequencing libraries, the DNA incorporated into EM-seq libraries
suffers from little to no damage and has very few biases associated with it. This combined with the fact
that the EM-seq method allows accurate calling of DNA methylation, enhances the potential of this
method for extraction of information from challenging samples, including low input, FFPE damaged and
cell free DNA. The method thereby enables discovery in areas of methylome research that have been
inaccessible to bisulfite sequencing.
Many researchers are pursuing multi-omics based approaches to better elucidate the various
mechanisms involved in gene regulation. Inclusion of EM-seq methylome information in these studies
will provide a more complete understanding of epigenomics and therefore when combined with mRNA
expression levels (RNA-seq), chromatin state determinations (ATAC-seq, NOMe-seq, NicE-seq, Hi-C,
Histone modifications), and regulatory factor occupancy (ChiP-seq) data will lead to enhanced multiomic comparisons. This ultimately will lead to a more complete understanding of cell regulation.

Materials and Methods
TET2 and APOBEC3A protein
Generation, expression and purification of the TET2 construct mTET2CDD are described previously [16].
The APOBEC3A protein was produced by (NEB, Ipswich, MA).
E14 Embryonic Stem (ES) Cell culture
ES cells were cultured as described [22]. Briefly, cells were grown in GMEM (Invitrogen) media
containing 10% FBS (Gemcell), 1% non-essential amino acids (NEAA) (Hyclone), 1% sodium pyruvate
(Invitrogen), 50 μM -mercaptoethanol (Sigma), and 1× LIF (Millipore). To maintain the undifferentiated
state, ES cells were grown on 0.1% gelatin-coated culture dishes (Stem Cell Technologies).
DNA substrates
Mouse NIH/3T3 and human Jurkat DNA were from NEB (Ipswich, MA), and XP12 phage DNA was
obtained from Dr. Peter Weigele (NEB, Ipswich, MA). E14 gDNA was extracted using QIAGEN DNeasy
Blood and Tissue Kit following manufacturer’s instructions (QIAGEN). NA12878 gDNA was obtained from
Corriell Cell Repositories (Camden, NJ). Unmethylated lambda DNA was obtained from Promega
(Promega, Madison, WI) and Arabidopsis gDNA from Biochain, CA. CpG methylated pUC19, was made by
transforming pUC19 plasmid (NEB, Ipswich, MA) into dam-/dcm- competent E.coli cells (NEB, Ipswich,

MA). Unmethylated pUC19 was extracted using the Monarch Plasmid Miniprep Kit (NEB, Ipswich, MA).
10 µg of pUC19 was CpG methylated in vitro using 40 units of M.SssI (NEB, Ipswich, MA) in a 200 µl final
reaction volume for 2 h at 37 °C. The reaction was cleaned up using NEBNext Sample Purification beads
with two 80% ethanol washes. CpG methylated pUC19 DNA was eluted in 100 µl H2O before repeating
the methylation reaction to minimize the presence of any unmethylated CpGs.
Enzymes and oligonucleotide substrates
All enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA) unless otherwise noted. Oligonucleotides
were synthesized by IDT (Coralville, IA).
Preparation of gDNA substrate mTET2 kinetics experiments
6 µg of gDNA was made up to 100 µl using 10mM Tris 1mM EDTA, pH 8.0 buffer and sheared to 1500 bp
using the Covaris S2 instrument. The sample was sheared using settings of 5% duty cycle, intensity 3 and
200 cycles/burst for 40 s. Sheared DNA was purified using either the Monarch PCR and DNA Cleanup kit
(NEB, Ipswich, MA) or QIAquick Nucleotide Removal Kit (QIAGEN). The purified DNA was eluted in H2O
and used in the TET reaction.
TET2 end timepoint reaction
A master mix containing 50 mM TRIS pH 8.0, 2 mM ATP, 1 mM DTT, 5 mM sodium ascorbate, 5 mM αKG,
varying concentrations of TET2 and 2 ng/µl gDNA was prepared in a final volume of 50 µl. The reaction
was initiated with the addition of 50 μM FeSO4 and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. The DNA sample was
then treated with 0.8 Units of Proteinase K (NEB, Ipswich, MA) for 60 min at 50 °C and subsequently
purified using Oligo Clean & Concentrator kit (Zymo Research) and analyzed for oxidized 5mC
modifications using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
according to the procedure and instruments described previously [16].
TET2 time-course reaction
A master mix containing 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 2 mM ATP, 1 mM DTT, 5 mM sodium ascorbate, 5 mM α-KG,
0.58 µg/µl or 10 μM TET2, and 50 μM FeSO4 was prepared in a 50 μl total volume and the reaction was
initiated with the addition of 0.9 ng/µl XP12 gDNA and was incubated at 37 °C. 20 μl aliquots were
removed at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 15, 60, and 120 min, and added to 200 μl isopropanol to quench the reaction.
The samples were centrifuged for 2 min at 13,000 rpm, dried using a SpeedVac vacuum concentrator

and resuspended in 50 μl of H2O. 0.8 U of Proteinase K (NEB, Ipswich, MA) was added and incubated for
60 min at 50 °C and the DNA was purified using the Oligo Clean & Concentrator kit (Zymo). DNA was
analyzed for oxidized 5mC modifications using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) according to the procedure and instruments described previously [16].
Glucosylation of 5hmC containing oligonucleotide
For the APOBEC3A substrate assay, a single stranded oligonucleotide containing 5hmC (Supplemental
Table 2) was glucosylated at the 5hmC. 10 μg of substrate was incubated with 40 U of T4-bGT
supplemented with 40 μM UDP-glucose in a 500 μl reaction for 16 h at 37oC.
APOBEC3A substrate specificity and site preference analysis
The oligonucleotides used for the quantitative analysis of APOBEC3A site preference are shown in
Supplemental Tables 1 and 2. Each oligonucleotide was assayed as follows. 2 μM ssDNA oligonucleotide
and 0.2 μM APOBEC3A in 1x reaction buffer (50 mM Bis-Tris, pH 6.0, 0.1% Triton X-100) were incubated
at 37°C. Incubation times varied according to the oligonucleotide being assayed. For the site preference
analysis, timepoints of 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 20 h were used. For substrate specificity assays, C and 5-mC
incubation times were 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256 min. For the oligonucleotides containing 5hmC,
5fC or 5caC, time points of 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 min, 5 and 22 h were used. Reactions were quenched
with 8 volumes of ethanol and the DNA was recovered by using the DNA Clean and Concentrator kit
(Zymo Research). DNA samples were digested to nucleosides using the Nucleoside Digestion Mix (NEB,
Ipswich, MA). Global nucleoside content analysis was performed by LC-MS or LC-MS/MS as noted (see
conditions below). For the site preference and substrate specificity assays, the data points were best
fitted by a single exponential equation to follow the disappearance of the appropriate nucleotide: C,
5mC, 5hmC, 5fC, or 5caC or U and T appearance (KaleidaGraph, Synergy Software).
Global nucleoside analysis using LC-MS and LC-MS/MS
LC-MS analysis was performed on an Agilent LC-MS System 1200 Series equipped with a G1315D diode
array detector and a 6120 Single Quadrupole Mass Detector operating in positive (+ESI) and negative (ESI) electrospray ionization modes. LC was carried out on a Waters Atlantis T3 column (4.6 × 150 mm, 3
μm) with a gradient mobile phase consisting of 10 mM aqueous ammonium acetate (pH 4.5) and
methanol. The relative abundance of each nucleoside was determined by UV absorbance.

LC-MS/MS analysis was performed in duplicate by injecting digested DNA on an Agilent 1290 UHPLC
equipped with a G4212A diode array detector and a 6490A Triple Quadrupole Mass Detector operating
in the positive electrospray ionization mode (+ESI). UHPLC was carried out on a Waters XSelect HSS T3
XP column (2.1 × 100 mm, 2.5 μm) with the gradient mobile phase consisting of 10 mM aqueous
ammonium formate (pH 4.4) and methanol. MS data acquisition was performed in the dynamic multiple
reaction monitoring (DMRM) mode. Each nucleoside was identified in the extracted chromatogram
associated with its specific MS/MS transition: dC [M+H]+ at m/z 228 →112, 5mC [M+H]+ at m/z
242→126, 5hmC [M+H]+ at m/z 258→142, 5fC [M+H]+ at m/z 256→140 and 5caC [M+H]+ at m/z
294→178. External calibration curves with known amounts of the nucleosides were used to calculate
their ratios within the analyzed samples.
Long Amplicon Generation
Sodium bisulfite conversion: 200 ng of NA12878 DNA was converted using the EZ DNA MethylationGold Kit (ZYMO Research, Irvine, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Enzymatic
5mC/5hmC Conversion: 200 ng of NA12878 DNA was incubated with 16 μg of TET2 enzyme in a buffer
containing 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 2 mM ATP, 1 mM DTT, 5 mM sodium ascorbate, 5 mM a-KG and 50 µM
Fe(II) for 30 min at 37oC, in a final volume of 50 µl. 20 U of T4-bGT (NEB, Ipswich, MA) and 1 µl of 50x
UDP-glucose were added and incubated for 30 min at 37oC. Then, 0.8 U of Proteinase K (NEB, Ipswich,
MA) was added and incubated for 30 min at 37oC. DNA was purified using a Genomic DNA Clean &
Concentrator (ZYMO Research, Irvine, CA). The DNA was then denatured by adding formamide to 20%
(v/v) at and incubating for 10 min at 90oC. DNA was deaminated using 0.26 μg of APOBEC3A in a 100 μl
reaction volume for 3 h. 3 µl from 100 µl of enzymatically converted and 1 µl from 15 µl of bisulfiteconverted DNA were PCR amplified with Q5U polymerase (NEB, Ipswich, MA) and primers
(Supplemental Table 3) using the following cycling conditions: 98oC for 30 s, then 35 cycles of 98oC for 10
s, 63oC for 20 s, and 68oC for 2 min. The resulting PCR products were 543, 1181, 1750, 2207 and 2945 bp.
PCR amplicons were visualized on a 2% agarose gel run in 1x TBE buffer and stained with ethidium
bromide.
Enzymatic Methyl-seq
10, 50 and 200 ng of NA12878 gDNA was combined with 0.1 ng CpG methylated pUC19 and 2 ng
unmethylated lambda control DNA and made up to 50 µl with 10 mM Tris 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0. The
DNA was transferred to a Covaris microTUBE (Covaris, Woburn, MA) and sheared to 240-290 bp using

the Covaris S2 instrument. DNA was sheared twice for 40 s at Duty Cycle: 10%, Intensity: 4, Cycles/Burst:
200. The 50 µl of sheared material was transferred to a PCR strip tube to begin library construction.
NEBNext DNA Ultra II Reagents (NEB, Ipswich, MA) were used according to the manufacturer’s
instructions for end repair, A-tailing and adaptor ligation of 0.4 µM EM-seq adaptor
(A5mCA5mCT5mCTTT5mC5mC5mCTA5mCA5mCGA5mCG5mCT5mCTT5mC5mCGAT5mC*T and
[Phos]GAT5mCGGAAGAG5mCA5mCA5mCGT5mCTGAA5mCT5mC5mCAGT5mCA). The ligated samples
were mixed with 110 µl of resuspended NEBNext Sample Purification Beads and cleaned up according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. The library was eluted in 29 µl of water. DNA was oxidized in a 50 µl
reaction volume containing 50 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM DTT, 5 mM Sodium-L-Ascorbate, 20 mM a-KG,
2 mM ATP, 50mM Ammonium Iron (II) sulfate hexahydrate, 0.04 mM UDG (NEB, Ipswich, MA), 16 µg
mTET2, 10 U T4-bGT (NEB, Ipswich, MA). The reaction was initiated by adding Fe (II) solution to a final
reaction concentration of 40 µM and then incubated for 1 h at 37oC. Following this, 0.8 U of proteinase K
(NEB, Ipswich, MA) was added and before incubation for 30 min at 37oC. At the end of the incubation,
the DNA was purified using 90 µl of resuspended NEBNext Sample Purification Beads according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. DNA was eluted in 17 µl of water and 16 µl was then transferred to a new
PCR tube and denatured by addition of 4 µl of formamide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and incubation
at 85oC for 10 min. The DNA was then deaminated in 50 mM Bis-Tris pH 6.0, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 µg
BSA (NEB, Ipswich, MA) using 0.2 µg of APOBEC3A. The reaction was incubated at 37oC for 3 h and the
DNA was purified using 100 µl of resuspended NEBNext Sample Purification Beads according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. The sample was eluted in 21 µl water and 20 µl was transferred to a new tube.
1 µM of NEBNext Unique Dual Index Primers and 25 µl NEBNext Q5U Master Mix (M0597, New England
Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) were added to the DNA and amplified as follows: 98oC for 30 s, then cycled 4 (200
ng), 6 (50 ng) and 8 (10 ng) times according to DNA input, 98oC for 10s, 62oC for 30 s and 65oC for 60 s. A
final extension of 65oC for 5 min and hold at 4oC. EM-seq libraries were purified using 45 µl of
resuspended NEBNext Sample Purification Beads and the sample was eluted in 21 µl water and 20 µl
was transferred to a new tube. Low input EM-seq libraries for 100 pg – 10 ng gDNA inputs were
processed as for the 10 – 200 ng gDNA inputs and used 2U T4-bGT. Libraries were quantified using
D1000HS Tape for TapeStation (Agilent) prior to sequencing on an Illumina NovaSeq instrument.

samples were sheared using the same conditions as EM-seq and processed through NEBNext Ultra II
library preparation. TruSeq DNA Single indices (Illumina, San Diego, CA) were used instead of the EM-seq
adaptor. Bisulfite conversion was performed using EZ DNA Methylation-Gold Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine,
CA) following manufacturer’s instructions.
DNA Analysis
Paired-end reads from WGBS and EM-seq libraries were sequenced on the same flowcells,
demultiplexed using Picard’s IlluminaBasecallsToFastq 2.18.17. Fastq reads were adapter trimmed
(trimadap from bwakit) and aligned to a reference genome including the GRCh38 analysis set and
sequences used as controls (phage lambda, puc19c, phage T4 and phage XP12) (Supplemental Table 5)
using bwameth. Reads were duplicate marked (samblaster) before sorting (sambamba). Figures were
generated from the same number of reads for each library, randomly sampled (sambamba view -t 8 -s
${frac_of_largest}). Methylation amounts by contig and context were calculated using Methyldackel
mbias and extracted using Methylation extract (default settings). The GC Bias plot was generated using
Picard’s CollectGCBiasMetrics and Insert size distribution was created with CollectInsertSizeMetrics.
We assessed the number of “usable reads” using “samtools view -F 0xF00 -q 10 -c $bam”
A nextflow workflow containing the analysis detail is available in the supplemental materials.
Due to excess control concentration in the low-input experiment, downsampling was performed to
produce equivalent numbers of human reads and replicates were assessed independently before
combination for final methylation assessment. Summary fractions are expressed as fractions of human
reads (instead of total reads). Otherwise, softward methods remained the same as for the standard
protocol libraries. Software versions: Methyldackel 0.3.0, bwameth=0.2.0, bwa=0.7.17, bwakit=0.7.15,
samblaster=0.1.24, sambamba=0.6.6, picard=2.18.14.

(A) Titration of TET2 (0 – 32 µg) with NA12878 gDNA shows that at all TET2 concentrations ³ 99% of 5mC
(blue) is oxidized to 5hmC (orange), 5fC (gray), and 5caC (yellow) with 5caC constituting ~ 70-85% of
total oxidized product. (B) TET2 activity on different genomic DNAs. ³ 99% of 5mC is converted to its
oxidized forms for all gDNAs in the presence of 16 µg TET2 except for Phage XP12 where 5mC
conversion was >95%. All reactions were performed with 200 ng gDNA in a total volume of 50 µL at 37
°C for 60 min. (C) LC-MS spectra showing the activity of TET2 and T4-bGT on Xp12 genomic DNA. rA is

Enzymatic Methyl-seq mechanism of action and workflow
(A) Principle pathways that are important for enzymatic identification of 5mC and 5hmC using Enzymatic
Methyl-seq. The actions of TET2 (blue) and T4-bGT (purple) on 5mC and its oxidation products, as well as
the activity of APOBEC3A (green) on cytosine, 5gmC and 5caC are shown. The red cross represents no
APOBEC3A activity. T4-bGT glucosylates 5hmC (pre-existing 5hmC and that formed by the action of
TET2). TET2 converts 5mC through the intermediates 5hmC and 5fC into 5caC. APOBEC3A has limited
activity on 5fC and undetectable activity on 5gmC and 5caC (Figure 3C). Uracil is replaced by thymine
during PCR and is read as thymine during Illumina sequencing. (B) DNA is sheared to approximately 300
bp, end repaired and 3’ A-tailed. EM-seq adaptors are then ligated to the DNA. The DNA is treated with
TET2 and T4-bGT before moving to the deamination reaction. The library is PCR amplified using EM-seq
adaptor primers and can be sequenced on any Illumina sequencer.

EM-seq Illumina libraries are superior to bisulfite libraries
10 ng, 50 ng or 200 ng of NA12878 DNA were spiked with control DNA (2 ng unmethylated lambda DNA
and 0.1 ng CpG methylated pUC19) and Illumina libraries were made using either EM-seq or the Zymo
Gold Bisulfite Kit prepped for Illumina sequencing using NEBNext Ultra II DNA library kit reagents.
Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 and 324 M read pairs per library were used for
analysis. (A) EM-seq uses less PCR cycles but results in more PCR product than whole genome bisulfite
libraries (WGBS) for all NA12878 input amounts. (B) Table of sequencing and alignment metrics for EMseq and WGBS libraries using 324 million Illumina read pairs. Metrics were calculated using bwa-meth,
Samtools, and Picard. Theoretical coverage is calculated using the number of bases sequenced/total
bases in the GRCh38 reference. Percent mapped refers to reads aligned to the reference genome
(grch38+controls), Percent Dups refers to reads marked as duplicate by Picard MarkDuplicates, Percent
Usable refers to the set of Proper-pair, MapQ 10+, Primary, non-Duplicate reads used in methylation
calling (samtools view -F 0xF00 -q 10). Effective Coverage is the Percent Usable * Theoretical coverage.
(C) GC-bias plot for EM-seq and WGBS libraries. EM-seq libraries display an even GC distribution while
WGBS libraries have an AT- rich and GC-poor profile.

EM-seq accurately represents methylation
EM-seq and bisulfite libraries were made using 10, 50 and 200 ng of NA12878 DNA with control DNA (2
ng unmethylated lambda and 0.1 ng CpG methylated pUC19). Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina
NovaSeq 6000 (2 x 100 bases). 324 million paired reads for each library were aligned to a human +
control reference genome (see supplemental materials) using bwa-meth 0.2.2. and methylation
information was extracted from the alignments using MethylDackel. The top and bottom strand CpGs
were counted independently, yielding a maximum of 56 million possible CpG sites. (A) NA12878 EM-seq
and whole genome bisulfite library (WGBS) methylation in CpG, CHH and CHG contexts are similarly
represented. Methylation state for unmethylated lambda control and CpG methylated pUC19 control
DNAs are shown in Supplemental Figure 5. (B) The number of CpGs covered for EM-seq and bisulfite
libraries were calculated and graphed at minimum coverage depths of 1x through 21x. (C) The number
of CpGs detected were compared between EM-seq and bisulfite libraries at 1x and 8x coverage depths.
CpGs unique to EM-seq libraries, bisulfite libraries or those that were common to both are represented
in the Venn diagrams. (D, E) Methylkit analysis at minimum 1x coverage shows good CpG methylation
correlation between 10 ng and 200 ng NA12878 EM-seq libraries (D) and WGBS libraries (E). Methylation
level correlations between inputs and replicates of EM-seq libraries are better than for WGBS libraries.

The reduction in observations of disagreement (upper left and lower right corners) is particularly
striking. Correlation between EM-seq and WGBS libraries at 10 ng, 50 ng, and 200 ng NA12878 DNA
input are shown in Supplemental Figure 7.

EM-seq Accurately determines methylation status of cytosines at key genomic features
324 million EM-seq and bisulfite paired reads were analyzed for each library and annotated using
Homer. (A) The number of CpGs covered within each genomic feature group is similar for 10 ng, 50 ng,
and 200 ng DNA inputs at 1x coverage. (B,C) EM-seq and WGBS cover a wide and variable range of
genomic features at 8x minimum coverage. Genomic features found only with EM-seq, only with
bisulfite or those common to both types of library are shown. (D) Heat map of CpG coverage for +/- 2kb
of the TSS for the three DNA inputs for EM-seq and bisulfite libraries at a minimum coverage of 1x. (E)
Percent of CpGs covered at a minimum of 8x coverage, +/- 2kb, across transcription start sites (TSS) and
(F) Methylation status for EM-seq and bisulfite libraries using 8x minimum coverage depth. EM-seq
libraries show less CpG methylation and more accurately represent the expected CpG methylation
pattern.

Minimum Coverage

Low DNA input EM-seq libraries
Low input EM-seq libraries were made using 100 pg, 500 pg, 1 ng and 10 ng of NA12878 DNA. Libraries
were sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 and evaluated for consistency before combining technical
replicates and sampling 810 million total human reads from each for methylation calling. (A)
Methylation levels are as expected for all DNA inputs at around 53%. (B) GC-bias plot for EM-seq library
replicates show even GC distribution. (C) CpG coverage as a function of minimum coverage depth is
similar to standard-protocol libraries and shows the impact of library complexity and duplication on
coverage.
