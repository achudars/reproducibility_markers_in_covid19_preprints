Abstract

11

Protein-protein interactions (PPI) can be conveniently represented as networks, allowing the

12

use of graph theory in their study. Network topology studies may reveal patterns associated to

13

specific organisms. Here we propose a new methodology to denoise PPI networks and predict

14

missing links solely based on the network topology, the Organization Measurement (OM)

15

method. The OM methodology was applied in the denoising of the PPI networks of two

16

Saccharomyces Cerevisiae datasets (Yeast and CS2007) and one Homo Sapiens dataset

17

(Human). To evaluate the denoising capabilities of OM methodology, two strategies were

18

applied. The first compared its application in random networks and in the reference set

19

networks, while the second perturbed the networks with the gradual random addition and

20

removal of edges. The application of OM methodology to the Yeast and Human reference sets

21

achieved an AUC of 0.95 and 0.87, in Yeast and Human networks, respectively. The random

22

removal of 80% of the Yeast and Human reference sets interactions resulted in an AUC of 0.71

23

and 0.62, whereas the random addition of 80% interactions resulted in an AUC of 0.75 and

24

0.72, respectively. Applying the OM methodology to the CS2007 dataset yields an AUC of

25

0.99. We also perturbed the network of the CS2007 dataset by randomly inserting and

26

removing edges in the same proportions previously described. The false positives identified

27

and removed from the network varied from 97%, when inserting 20% more edges, to 89%

28

when 80% more edges were inserted. The true positives identified and inserted in the network

29

varied from 95% when removing 20% of the edges, to 40% after the random deletion 80%

30

edges. The OM methodology is sensitive to the topological structure of the biological networks.

The obtained results suggest that the present approach can efficiently be used to denoise PPI

32

networks.

Introduction

34

Proteins are central players in every organism, as they are required for virtually every single

35

cellular function. However, proteins are required to interact with one another to fulfil their

36

functions. For this reason, disease states may appear, if the physiological interaction between

37

two proteins is disrupted [1].

38

Protein-protein interactions (PPI) networks are a subset of complex biological networks that

39

have specific topological properties, such as a high clustering coefficient, the presence of

40

hierarchy, heterogeneity and a power-law-like degree distribution [2]. The guilt-by-associa tio n

41

hypothesis states that two proteins sharing many interactive neighbours are likely to hold

42

functional homogeneity and localization coherence [3]. These characteristics suggest that

43

network topology alone may be a viable option for PPI network denoising. PPI network

44

denoising corresponds to find interactions that do not exist and to find missing interactio ns.

45

Methods to determine protein interactions are not accurate and organisms are not yet fully

46

known, being important to denoise PPI networks to have more precise models of the organis ms.

47

Protein interactions can be represented as graphs, allowing the use of graph theory in their

48

study. As such, different methods were developed to denoise biological networks [reviewed in

49

4]. These include repeating experiments [5, 6], using prior knowledge about proteins [7, 8],

50

using functional or structural annotations [9-13] and using comparisons with theoretica l

51

distributions constructed from known data and network topology-based approaches [14-18].

52

The herein proposed approach falls under the latter category.

53

An approach, called Non-Convex Semantic Embedding (NCSE) evaluates the reliability of

54

interactions in a PPI network trying to learn a Euclidean embedding under the geometric

55

assumption of PPI networks [19] and it was tested in three data sets of Yeast Saccharomyces

56

Cerevisiae. Computational methods based on machine learning were also applied to evaluate

57

the reliability of PPI and tested in Yeast and Helicobacter Pylori PPI datasets [20, 21].

58

In a recent study, Lü et al. [22] proposed the structural consistency index and the Structural

59

Perturbation Method (SPM). On the one hand, the structural consistency index can reflect the

60

inherent link predictability of a network without knowing its organization a priori, allowing to

61

estimate the explicability of the organization of a network, and to supervise mechanistic

62

changes during the evolution of the network. On the other hand, the SPM performs link

63

prediction by removing a percentage of the edges in a network, thus perturbing the remaining

64

network by that percentage. This is based on the strong correlation between independent

65

network perturbations, which suggests that the missing edges, i.e., False Negative (FN)

66

interactions can be identified by perturbing the networks with an additional set of known

67

interactions, i.e., True Positive (TP) interactions.

68

Luo et al. [4] proposed the Collaborative Filtering-enhanced Topology-based (CFT) method to

69

perform protein interatomic mapping on sparse High-Throughput Screening (HTS) PPI data,

70

since the performance of network topology-based approach usually deteriorates when using

71

sparse network data. This approach is based on the notion that the solution space of the

72

interatomic mapping and the solution space of the personalized recommendations are similar.

73

Each protein is represented as a feature vector that describes their interactions in the network.

74

In addition, the feature vector is used to calculate the corresponding similarity vector that

75

represents the interactions through the Functional Similarity weight, creating an Inter-

76

Neighbourhood Similarity (I-Sim) for modelling PPIs. Functional parameters for each protein

77

in the dataset are obtained from Gene Ontology (GO), allowing the use of functional similar ity

78

measures. Denoising of the input HTS-PPI data is performed via the integration of saturation-

79

based strategies into the I-Sim, achieving a precise relationship model. Their method was

80

applied to three different datasets and compared with three other algorithms (Interactio n

81

Generality [14], Czekanowski-Dice distance [15], and Functional Similarity weight [16]),

82

showing better performance on large, sparse HTS-PPI datasets. Since they use GO annotatio ns

83

to characterize their proteins, this approach is likely to underperform when considering less

84

studied organisms.

85

A different strategy termed Intrinsic Geometry Structure (IGS) was proposed by Yi Fang et al.

86

[23]. IGS is a geometry-based approach which uses heat diffusion in the PPI network to collect

87

structural information about all paths connecting two given nodes, thus defining intrins ic

88

relationships among them. They use a maximum likelihood-based algorithm to determine the

89

optimal dissipation time, predicting the global structure of the PPI network from the local

90

structure. After performing heat diffusion for the optimal dissipation time, the intrins ic

91

geometric structure of the PPI network is revealed. One of the main advantages of the IGS

92

method is its robustness against missing protein associations and sparse PPI data. Their method

93

was tested with the S. cerevisiae (CS2007) network [24], a network of the bottlenose dolphin

94

community [25], and a network of known terrorist cells [26]. In addition, they compared the

95

performance of IGS with two other methods, the Multi-Dimensional Scaling-based (MDS)

96

method [27] and the Hierarchical Random Graph (HRG) method [28], showing that IGS

97

performed slightly better than MDS when tested with the CS2007 dataset and better than IGS

98

and HRG for the other datasets tested. Their analysis was based only in the Area Under the

99

Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC) values.

100

Among the described works, the MDS method proposed by Kuchaiev et al. [27] is the only one

101

relying in PPI network topology that was applied in a Homo Sapiens PPI dataset. To address

102

the sparsity problem of the networks, Luo et al. [4] uses collaborative filtering, but the method

103

was not tested on perturbed networks, i.e., when added random noise. The IGS method [23]

104

was compared to the MDS method using the Yeast Saccharomyces Cerevisiae PPI dataset, and

105

both methods were tested in perturbed networks with the same percentages (from 10% till

106

80%). However, they were not able to determine which of the edges recovered belong to

107

removed group, or which of the edges removed are then recovered.

108

In this paper, we introduce the Organization Measurement (OM) method to denoise PPI

109

networks based exclusively in the network topology. Topological measures are used to find

110

trends that characterize interacting and non-interacting proteins distributions. A high

111

confidence set of protein interactions is used to construct a network, followed by the calculatio n

112

of the weights of interactions and non-interactions in the network. The OM weighted matrix is

113

obtained and used to find distribution trends that allow to distinguish interaction distributio ns

114

from non-interaction distributions. The OM threshold value that better distinguishes these types

115

of distributions is then used to identify False Positive (FP) interactions and FN (novel)

116

interactions. This way, an OM topological model is built to be used in the denoising of a

117

network, resulting in a better approximation of the expected network.

118

Materials and Methods

119

This section will describe how we obtained the datasets used in the experiments and the

120

topological measures used with the Organization Measurement (OM) methodology, includ ing

121

the new Neighbourhood Clustering (NC) proposed measure. It will also describe the OM

122

methodology, how to obtain the OM matrix of weights and how to determine the threshold

123

value, giving a description of the OM methodology pipeline (Fig 1) to denoise networks.

124

For each organism, we collected a set of high-confidence PPI interactions. Although these PPI

125

do not reflect the entirety of the protein interaction networks of the selected organisms, they

126

were used to construct the known PPI network of each organism, i.e., their reference sets.

127

In the application of the OM methodology, various topological measures were calculated to

128

characterize these networks, based on the assumption that these measures will allow the

129

identification of topologic patterns to support network denoising. In this paper, we use the term

130

“denoising” to define the identification of FP and FN interactions, removing the former cases

131

from the network while adding the latter. The methodology proposed here can also be used to

132

rank the level of confidence of the interactions already presented in the network. Differ e nt

133

topological measures can identify different patterns and thus, here we consider that differe nt

134

topological measures can contribute to the denoising process.

matrix from the adjacency matrix, another section will describe how to determine the OM THR

value using the ROC curve and a last section will describe how to use the threshold in the

Datasets

150

The Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) database [29]

151

contains known and predicted protein interactions of various organisms. PPI in STRING derive

152

from five main sources: (1) genomic context predictions; (2) high-throughput experime nta l

153

methods; (3) conserved co-expression experiments; (4) automated text mining, and; (5)

154

previous knowledge from third-party databases. Each interaction in STRING has an associated

155

score for each prediction method and has a Combined Score (CS) that range from 0 to 1000,

156

indicating the degree of confidence of each interaction. Calculation of the CS considers several

157

parameters, such as the number and the quality of different sources indicating that a PPI occurs.

158

The interactions derived by experimental methods with a score greater than 900 have been

159

considered of high-confidence in multiple works [30, 31]. Therefore, the reference sets used in

160

this work comprise experimentally determined PPI data obtained from STRING with a score

161

greater than or equal to 900.

162

These data were collected from two different organisms, namely the Yeast Saccharomyces

163

Cerevisiae (Yeast) and Homo Sapiens (Human) [29]. Using these data, an undirected network

164

is constructed for each organism and the main component is extracted.

165

Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the reference set networks obtained for Yeast and

166

Human, including the number of nodes, the number of edges, the average degree and network

167

density. The observed average degree and density values are highly suggestive that these are

168

biological networks are sparse, i.e., they have much less edges than the complete network with

169

the same set of nodes. Our high-confidence networks (i.e., PPIs obtained from the STRIN G

170

database with experimental source score greater than 900) comprised 29,319 interactio ns

171

between 3,937 proteins for the Yeast dataset and 16,931 interactions between 4,943 proteins

172

for the Human dataset.

173

Additionally, we used a high confidence external dataset compiled by Collins et al. [24] and

174

referred to as CS2007 hereafter, to compare the proposed methodology with other topology-

175

based denoising methods [23, 27, 32]. This dataset comprises 9,074 PPIs between 1,622 unique

176

proteins from Yeast Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. To ensure a direct comparison between the

OM methodology and the existing methods we followed their approaches and only used the

largest connected component. The largest connected component of the dataset compiled by

Collins et al. [24] includes 8,323 interactions between 1,004 proteins (Table 1).

Measures for similarity and diversity analysis of network data

184

Protein interactions can be conveniently modelled as a network, where each node represents a

185

protein and each edge represents an association between two proteins. The most commonly

186

used technique to quantify the interaction profile similarity of protein interaction networks (or

187

any type of biological network) relies on association indices. Bass et al. [33] performed a

188

comprehensive review on the selection of association indices for the analysis of gene similar ity.

189

In their work, the Jaccard (JC), Geometric and Cosine indices were shown to be the most

190

versatile, as though not excelling in any particular task, their strengths were the most balanced

191

out of all evaluated measures. A review of similarity indices can also be found in [34].

192

Daminelli et al. test the application of different association indexes to bipartite networks [35].

193

A more recent study reports that the JC measure performs better than three other measures in

194

a specific model [36].

195

The JC measure is defined as the ratio of the intersection of the number of neighbours of nodes

196

𝑖 and 𝑗 divided by their union (i.e., the ratio of nodes shared between 𝑖 and 𝑗 divided by the

197

total number of nodes connected to both):
𝐽𝐶𝑖𝑗 =

|Γ(𝑖 ) ∩ Γ(𝑗)|
|Γ(𝑖 ) ∪ Γ(𝑗)|

198

where Γ(𝑖 ) is the set of neighbours of i. We also explored and tested additional measures and

199

two of them that gave good results were Betweenness (BETW), and Katz indexes.

200
201

The implementation of Betweeness (BETW) used was:
(2)

𝐵𝐸𝑇𝑊𝑖𝑗 = (𝐵𝐸𝑇𝑊𝑖 + 𝐵𝐸𝑇𝑊𝑗 )/2
202

where

𝐵𝐸𝑇𝑊𝑖 = ∑
𝑙 ,𝑚∈𝑉

𝑛𝑠𝑝(𝑙, 𝑚|𝑖)
𝑛𝑠𝑝(𝑙, 𝑚)

(3)

203

where 𝑉 is the set of nodes, 𝑛𝑠𝑝(𝑙, 𝑚) is the number of (𝑙, 𝑚) shortest paths and 𝑛𝑠𝑝(𝑙, 𝑚|𝑖)

204

is the number of those paths passing through the node 𝑖.

205

The implementation of Katz used was:

𝐾𝐴𝑇𝑍𝑖𝑗 =

(𝐾𝐴𝑇𝑍𝑖 + 𝐾𝐴𝑇𝑍𝑗 )
2

(4)

𝐾𝐴𝑇𝑍𝑖 = 𝛼 ∑ 𝐴𝑑𝑗𝑖𝑙 𝑥 𝑙 + 𝛽

(5)

𝑙

206

with 𝐴𝑑𝑗 the adjacency matrix of the network with eigenvalues . It was used 𝛼 = 1⁄𝑚𝑎𝑥

207

and 𝛽 = 0, when Katz centrality is the same as the eigenvector centrality.

208

Based on the idea that closely associated proteins are more likely to interact, that the network

209

modularity is associated with the Clustering Coefficient (CC) [37] and a high mean CC of a

210

community can be used to identify those that are functionally homogeneous [38], we

211

implemented a novel measure to emphasize the relevance of the CC concept associated to the

212

neighbourhood concept in a network. This measure was called Neighbourhood Clustering (NC)

213

measure and is defined as the ratio of the sum of the CC of the nodes shared between i and j

214

divided by the sum of the CC of the total number of nodes connected to both i and j:

𝑁𝐶𝑖𝑗 =

∑ 𝐶𝐶 (Γ(𝑖) ∩ Γ(𝑗))
∑ 𝐶𝐶 (Γ(𝑖) ∪ Γ(𝑗))

(6)

215

where Γ(𝑖 ) is the set of neighbours of i.

216

Organization measurement matrix

217

In Fig 1 we summarize the pipeline of the proposed OM methodology. Once the PPI network

218

(Reference Set) for the or’ganism is constructed, its respective adjacency matrix is built,

219

followed by its transformation into a weighed matrix, the OM matrix. The OM matrix is used

220

to find distribution trends that allow to distinguish interactions and non-interactions. The

221

weights for interactions and non-interactions are calculated using topological measures and

222

using the information about the interactions of the network.

223

The adjacency matrix of the PPI network A, with 𝑁 proteins and 𝑀 interactions is defined

224

as 𝑎𝑑𝑗𝐴 = [𝑎(𝑖, 𝑗)], where 𝑎(𝑖, 𝑗) = 1, if there is an interaction in A between nodes 𝑖 and 𝑗.

225

Otherwise, 𝑎(𝑖, 𝑗) = 0. A topological measure is applied to A to determine a weight for each

226

(𝑖, 𝑗) to transform the adjacency matrix 𝐴 into a transformed matrix 𝐴𝑤 = [𝑎𝑤 (𝑖, 𝑗)], where

227

𝑎𝑤 (𝑖, 𝑗) is the weight of (𝑖, 𝑗) in 𝐴, calculated using the topological properties of the network.

228

The weight 𝑎𝑤 (𝑖, 𝑗) represents the strength value of the edge (𝑖, 𝑗) per the topological measure

229

used and aims to capture patterns associated to the network that can originate signatures that

230

identify the PPI network of each organism. This weight was used to characterize interactio n

231

and non-interaction distributions of the PPI network to determine the separation border

232

between them.

233

Organization measurement threshold value determination

234

One of the assumptions made in this work is that the PPIs in the reference datasets are true.

235

This assumption can be made due to the sparsity of protein interaction networks and the

236

rigorous criteria chosen to filter TP interactions. However, the same cannot be said for the non-

237

interactions, as the presence of FN PPI is highly likely.

238

The value that best distinguishes both interactions and non-interactions distributions was called

239

the OM threshold value. First, we collect protein interactions data of a specific organism and

240

then a network is built (Fig 1). Then, the respective adjacency matrix is constructed, followed

241

by its transformation into a weighted matrix, the OM matrix, using the topological measures

242

of interest. Finally, the ROC curve is calculated and used to determine the optimal cut-off,

243

corresponding to the threshold value that separates the interaction distributions from non-

244

interaction distributions. We considered as the optimal cut, the point closest to (0,1) in the ROC

245

curve, where sensitivity equals specificity. Different topological measures were tested and the

246

respective cut-off values were determined. The outcomes of these experiments are described

247

in the “Results and discussion” section.

248

Organization measurement methodology to find spurious and new interactions

249

An accepted assumption in network topology-based approaches is that interacting proteins in

250

a local community and closer to one another in the network are most likely involved in similar

251

functions, or part of the same pathways [39-41]. The use of topological measures that capture

252

this information should be prioritized, as they are expected to better grasp patterns in

253

incomplete networks, thus allowing the approximation of incomplete input networks to the real

254

networks.

255

From each reference set (Reference Set) PPI network we calculated its adjacency matrix. Then,

256

after calculating the respective weights, the adjacency matrix is transformed into a weight

257

matrix. Finally, the threshold that best separates PPI and non-PPIs was determined through the

258

finding of the optimal cut-off of the ROC curve. This threshold was applied to detect spurious

259

and missing PPI in the network (Data Set), to obtain a better approximation of the true network.

260

In the example network shown in Fig 1, there are five nodes representing five different proteins,

261

in addition to six edges that could represent the interactions between them (Data Set).

262

Assuming the example network approximates the current knowledge of a given biologic a l

263

network, not all true interactions are represented and the existence of FP is expected. Once the

264

threshold value is calculated, using the reference set (Reference Set), it is applied to the OM

265

matrix of the Data Set, to identify FP and FN interactions. FP interactions are then removed

266

from the network, whereas FN interactions are added.

267

Results and Discussion

268

The OM methodology was tested with different topological measures and was evaluated using

269

three different scenarios. Next subsections will describe the results obtained with the

270

experiments made.

271

Analysis of different topological measures to identify the optimal threshold value

272

A key component of the proposed method is the determination of the threshold value to

273

discriminate between protein interactions and non-protein interactions distributions. As such,

274

we decided to test the OM methodology with different topological measures to determine

275

which better discriminates PPI from non-PPI. The four topological measures used were the JC,

276

the BETW, the KATZ and the proposed new measure, the NC. Fig 2 shows the ROC curves

277

when using this methodology with four different topological measures for the Yeast and

278

Human organisms and Fig 3 shows the same information, but after data normalization between

279

0 and 1. Table 2 shows the respective AUC values obtained. Best results were achieved when

280

using OM methodology with the JC and NC measures.

In addition to testing the OM methodology with these measures, we calculated the cut- off

293

values for both the optimal cut and the accuracy cut, using the JC and NC measures, those that

294

previously gave better results. The optimal cut calculates the point closest to (0,1) in the ROC

295

curve, where sensitivity equals specificity, whereas the accuracy cut calculates the maximum

296

accuracy and the respective cut-off value. In the next experiments, to determine OM THR, we

297

calculated the cut-off values for the optimal cut, obtaining good results.

that the NC measure gave a slightly better result than JC and so we will describe forward the

Evaluation of the organization measurement methodology in different scenarios

309

To assess whether the OM methodology is sensitive to the network topology, we applied it to

310

a randomly generated protein network, with the same number of nodes and edges as their

311

respective reference sets (for Yeast and Human). If the OM methodology can distinguis h

312

between interactions and non-interactions in the reference data sets but fails to do so in the

313

random networks, one can assume that it captures the inherent topological structure of a real

314

network.

315

To further evaluate the performance of OM methodology two other experiments were

316

performed. First, while maintaining the same number of nodes (proteins), we randomly added

317

incrementing percentages of edges (proteins interactions), 20%, 40%, 60% and 80%, not

318

belonging to the reference set network, building four networks and removed the same

319

percentages of edges from the reference set network, building more four networks. This was

320

performed for the Yeast, Human and CS2007 reference set networks. After each addition or

321

removal, we used the OM methodology to denoise the networks. To further assess the ability

322

of the proposed methodology for network denoising, we also determined the percentage of

323

inserted TN removed from the respective CS2007 perturbed networks and the percentage of

324

TP retrieved from the respective CS2007 perturbed networks. A thorough description of the

325

results of these experiments are shown in the following sub-sections.

Organization measurement methodology performance comparison: random network

327

versus reference set network

328

The only criteria selected to generate the random networks was that the resulting randomize

329

networks were required to comprise the same number of nodes and edges. Thus, we generated

330

10 networks for each organism to be tested using the NC measure.

331

Fig 4 shows the ROC curves, the separation of classes (PPI e non-PPI) curves and the accuracy

332

curve, when applying the OM methodology with the NC topological measure to one of the

333

Yeast (left column) and Human (right column) random networks generated with the same

334

number of nodes and edges of the respective reference sets. Analysing their ROC curves, we

335

can see a clear distinction in performance between the application of OM methodology to the

336

random network (Fig 4) and the subsets of the real networks (Fig 2). The AUC obtained after

337

using the proposed method in all 10 random networks generated was close to 0.5 for both

338

organisms (Yeast and Human), while for the subset of the Yeast network and Human network

339

the AUC was 0.9534 and 0.8708, respectively.

346

Random insertion of edges

347

To evaluate the performance of the OM methodology for denoising PPI networks, we perturbed

348

the networks of the reference sets by randomly adding incrementing percentages of edges to

349

the networks of the Yeast and Human reference sets and the CS2007 reference set.

350

We created four noisy networks for each data set, adding 20% more edges to the origina l

351

network, followed by 40%, 60% and 80%. These intervals were selected following the research

352

conducted by Yi Fang et al. [23]. Fig 5 shows the ROC curves when the OM methodology is

353

applied to the networks of the Yeast and Human reference sets and to the four noisy networks

354

generated from each of them. We can observe a decreasing of performance when we increase

355

the percentage of the random edges added.

To be able to compare the performance of OM methodology with other network-based

randomly inserting edges in the same proportions previously described. Fig 6 shows the

After denoising the networks with the OM methodology, we also calculated the percentage of

384

Random deletion of edges

385

To evaluate the performance of the OM methodology for the identification of missing

386

interactions, four new networks were created for each dataset (i.e., Yeast, Human, and CS2007

387

reference sets) by removing increasing percentages of edges from the respective reference set

388

networks. Edge removal was performed in the same proportion as edge addition: 20%, 40%,

389

60% and 80%. By removing increasing percentages of edges from the respective reference set

390

networks, we are creating smaller sparse networks and at the same time we are deteriorating

391

their inherent structure. The results are shown in Fig 7, representing the ROC curves, when the

392

OM methodology is applied to the eight noisy networks referred previously, of the Yeast and

393

Human reference set networks.

400

These results show a scenario alike the one observed after randomly adding edges, as greater

401

reductions in the number of edges result in greater performance drops, but the performance

402

drops are steeper in the Human organism.

403

Fig 8 shows a graphic of the AUCs values, when the OM methodology is applied to the four

404

noisy networks obtained from the CS2007 network, referred previously, compared to the MDS

and IGS methodologies [23]. OM methodology has a better performance compared to the IGS

406

and MDS methodologies, except when 80% of the interactions are removed from the CS2007

407

reference set, where the application of IGS gives better results. Further details are in Table 6,

where we can observe that 95% of the TP removed could be detected when the OM

methodology is applied to the perturbed network, when 20% of the interactions of the reference

Analysis

422

Different topological measures were used to identify the optimal threshold, with the Yeast and

423

Human reference sets and comparative testing showed (Figs 2 and 3 and Table 2) that the best

424

results were obtained using the JC and the NC measures, and thus we decided to use both in

425

some experiments of this work. JC is a widely known measure frequently used in network

426

denoising and missing link prediction. It also considers the neighbourhood information, which

427

is aligned with the “guilt-by-association” principle. The same applies to the NC index,

428

proposed herein, where the concept of CC is also taken into account.

429

The OM methodology was then applied to the Yeast and Human datasets, using the JC and the

430

NC measures and after analysing Tables 3 and 4, where the AUC values and the cut-off values

431

for both the optimal cut and the accuracy cut for the Yeast and Human reference sets obtained

432

are shown, it can be seen that the NC measure performed better than the JC measure at

433

discriminating between protein interactions and non-interactions and for this reason the NC

434

measure was used in the evaluation of the OM methodology.

435

Three different scenarios were considered to evaluate the OM methodology. The first one uses

436

randomly generated protein networks, with the same number of nodes and edges as their

437

respective reference sets (Yeast and Human). Observing the Fig 4 we can see that the AUC,

438

obtained when applying the OM methodology to one of the random networks, was close to 0.5

439

for both organisms (Yeast and Human), while for the Yeast and Human reference sets, the

440

AUC was 0.9534 and 0.8708, respectively (Fig 2), which shows that OM is sensitive to the

441

inherent topological structure of a real network. These results show that the OM methodology

442

cannot distinguish between interactions and non-interactions in random networks, but can

443

capture the inherent rules of biological networks, not present in random networks.

444

The second scenario used to evaluate the performance of OM methodology, consisted in

445

applying OM to networks obtained from the two Yeast and Human reference sets, where the

446

number of nodes (proteins) was maintained, but where a random percentage of edges (proteins

447

interactions), 20%, 40%, 60% and 80%, not belonging to the reference set network, were

448

added, and the third scenario is similar to the second but instead of adding, the same random

449

percentages of edges were removed from the reference set network.

450

In the second scenario (random insertion of edges), as expected, greater increments of random

451

edges resulted in greater performance reductions (Fig 5). The performance reductions were

452

steeper in Human, which could be attributed to one major reason: the percentage of FN is most

453

likely greater in the Human interactome than in the Yeast interactome. Thus, it could be argued

454

that the Yeast reference set is a more reliable, better representation of the actual Yeast

455

interactome, than the Human reference set is of the real Human interactome. When we add

456

these percentages of random edges, the inherent structure of these biological networks becomes

457

deteriorated, because we are probably adding TN.

458

In the third scenario (random deletion of edges), greater reductions in the number of edges

459

result in greater performance drops compared to the second scenario, but the performance drops

460

are steeper in the Human organism (Fig 7). This could be explained by the fact that we are

461

removing TP from both networks. However, since the Yeast network seems to be a closer

462

representation of its true network than the Human network, the accentuated deterioration in the

463

structure of the Human network could explain this behaviour.

464

So, when comparing the results between edge addition and edge removal in Yeast and Human

465

reference sets (Figs 5 and 7), we witness that the overall performance reductions were quite

466

dissimilar. Adding just 20% more edges contributed to a reduction of approximately 0.08 in

467

AUC for Yeast, and 0.06 AUC for Human. Further addition of edges beyond this point did not

468

decrease the AUC as sharply. Contrariwise, after removing 20% of the existing edges, the AUC

469

decreased by roughly 0.02 for both Yeast and Human, with greater performance drops afte r

470

each percentage of edges removal.

471

The better performance observed for the Yeast interactome could be explained by its smaller

472

size compared to the Human interactome, in addition to being relatively well-studied, meaning

473

that input data quality plays an important role in the performance of computational methods.

474

Additionally, the negative impact in performance observed after randomly adding edges

475

suggests that the OM methodology is very sensitive to high percentages of FP and FN.

476

To compare the performance of OM methodology with other network-based methodologies

477

proposed by other researchers, CS2007 network reference set was perturbed by randomly

478

inserting edges in the same proportions previously described in scenario two and by randomly

479

deleting edges in the same proportions previously described in scenario three. OM

480

methodology was compared to the MDS and IGS methodologies [23]. Figs 6 and 8 show the

481

AUC values when these methodologies were applied to this dataset and it can be seen a general

482

improvement in the performance when the OM methodology is applied compared to the MDS

483

and IGS methodologies. When 80% of random TP of network interactions are removed, the

484

AUC of IGS is superior than the AUC od OM and MDS. This could not mean, in this case, that

485

OM is worst, since removing 80% of the TP makes the model very close to a random network

486

and a denoising method, for consistency, should not be able to detect structure in such

487

networks.

488

Further analysis was conducted for these last networks with added random percentages of FP

489

interactions. OM methodology was applied and the percentage of FP interactions removed was

490

calculated (Table 5). Interestingly, most of the randomly inserted FP interactions were

491

promptly identified, even when the network was heavily perturbed, with 89% of the FP

492

removed after contaminating the network with 6,658 random interactions. These results suggest

493

that the OM methodology can indeed capture the inherent topology of biological networks.

494

Interestingly, we observed that the number of TP identified after randomly removing edges

495

from the CS2007 dataset plummets after removing 60% of TP (Table 6). Still, the OM

496

methodology seems to identify most missing links up to that point. These findings suggest that

497

the OM methodology can assess whether the topological structure of a network is according to

498

the characteristic topology of biological networks.

499

OM methodology could still work well in less-studied interactomes, when the subset of the

500

interactome of interest is a representative sample of the structure of the entire interacto me,

501

meaning that the percentage of FP and FN cannot hide the inherent structure behind the

502

biological networks of the organisms.

503

Conclusions

504

Currently, low-throughput experimental methods are the only effective way to validate protein

505

interactions. While high-throughput experimental methods to obtain PPIs exist, the obtained

506

results have very high noise. As such, computational methods are required to speed data

507

acquisition and to reduce the data contamination. Methods relying exclusively in the topology

508

of biological networks are simpler and faster, as it appears that networks topology may reveal

509

patterns or signatures associated with the kind of organism and the type of interactions. If we

510

can use, effectively, only the topology to denoise biological networks, we have a simple

511

computational method suitable for incomplete interactomes, without the need of extra

512

biological knowledge.

513

This paper introduces the OM methodology for denoising biological networks, a methodology

514

that: a) uses exclusively the topology of the network; b) enables, easily, to separate the

515

distributions of interaction and non-interaction proteins in PPI networks; c) does not use known

516

distributions as approximations; and d) provides a topological way of detecting FP interactio ns

517

and find new interactions. The main innovation of the OM methodology is related with its

518

ability to combine the advantages of using exclusively the topology without taking

519

approximations to known distributions and without using external knowledge to detect

520

interactions that do not exist or to find new interactions with a better performance than some

521

documented used methodologies. This paper also introduces a new network topologic measure,

522

the NC measure, which is used with the OM methodology and yielded better results, compared

523

to other known and current topological measures.

other domains, where there is an inherent structure, to predict new interactions and elimina te
