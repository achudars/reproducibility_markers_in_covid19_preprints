SUMMARY:
Bacterial ribosome biogenesis and translation occur in the same cellular compartment.
Therefore, a biochemical gate-keeping step is required to prevent immature ribosomes
from engaging in protein synthesis. Here, we show that the abundant ribosome
assembly factor, RbfA, creates this checkpoint by suppressing protein synthesis by
immature E. coli 30S subunits. After 30S maturation, RbfA is released by initiation factor
3 (IF3), which remains bound to 30S subunits to promote translation initiation. Genetic
interactions between RbfA and IF3 show that IF3 is important for RbfA release during
logarithmic growth. Moreover, IF3 is the main pathway for RbfA release in stationary
phase when the activity of a less abundant RbfA-release factor, RsgA GTPase, is
inhibited by the alarmone (p)ppGpp. By gating the transition from 30S biogenesis to
translation initiation, RbfA and IF3 maintain the integrity of bacterial protein synthesis
under a range of growth conditions and especially under stress.

INTRODUCTION:
Unlike yeast and other eukaryotes, ribosome biogenesis in bacteria occurs in the
same cell compartment as protein synthesis (Klinge and Woolford, 2019; Shajani et al.,
2011). Although bacteria lack membrane compartments, they must nevertheless
encode robust biochemical checkpoints that gate the transition from ribosome
biogenesis to translation. A barrier that prevents immature ribosomes from entering
protein synthesis is essential for all cells, because translation by immature ribosomal
subunits is inefficient and error prone (Andrade et al., 2018; ClatterbuckSoper et al.,
2013; Cole et al., 2009; Davies et al., 2010; Roy-Chaudhuri et al., 2010; Soudet et al.,
2010). How immature ribosomes are prevented from initiating translation in bacteria is
not well understood. It is also not known whether the same checkpoint mechanism
operates during log phase growth and in poor growth conditions that cause immature
subunits to accumulate (Shajani et al., 2011).
In yeast, 40S ribosome assembly factors act as fidelity checkpoints at the last
stages of pre-40S maturation prior to translation initiation (Strunk et al., 2011, 2012),
through the formation of 80S-like complexes. These late assembly factors interact with
the regions of the pre-40S ribosome that are recognized by translation initiation factors.
A similar quality control step has not been clearly demarcated in bacteria (Datta et al.,
2007; Guo et al., 2011). The binding sites of bacterial assembly factors also overlap the
binding sites of translation initiation factors IF1, IF2 and IF3 (Datta et al., 2007; Guo et
al., 2011; Hussain et al., 2016), however, suggesting that bacterial assembly factors
may also prevent translation initiation by immature subunits. It is not known which
factors mark the end of 30S biogenesis and the start of translation initiation.
Ribosome binding factor A (RbfA) is a strong candidate for the last gatekeeper in
30S biogenesis. The most abundant 30S subunit assembly factor, RbfA overexpression
suppressed genetic defects in pre-16S processing (Dammel and Noller, 1995; Gibbs et
al., 2017; Thurlow et al., 2016) while rbfA deletion impaired 30S biogenesis at low
temperatures (Jones and Inouye, 1996; Xia et al., 2003). RbfA was associated with late
assembly intermediates (pre-30S) and with mature 30S subunits, but not with 70S
ribosomes or polysomes (Connolly and Culver, 2013; Dammel and Noller, 1995; Goto et
al., 2011). A low-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of a 30S•RbfA complex

showed that RbfA binds near the mRNA decoding A- and P-site and displaces the top of
16S helix (H) 44 and H45, rendering the complex unsuitable for joining with 50S
subunits (Datta et al., 2007).
The exclusion of RbfA from 70S ribosomes (Connolly and Culver, 2013; Dammel
and Noller, 1995; Goto et al., 2011) indicates that RbfA must be released before 30S
subunits can initiate translation. RbfA is known to be released from mature 30S subunits
by the GTPase RsgA (YjeQ) (Goto et al., 2011). In current models, GTP hydrolysis
induces a conformational change within RsgA that promotes the release of RbfA and
RsgA. Dissociation of RbfA and RsgA allows 16S helices H44 and H45 to dock with the
30S platform, making the 30S subunit suitable for translation (Goto et al., 2011; Guo et
al., 2011; Pedro Lopez-Alonso et al., 2017; Razi et al., 2017).
Despite the well-characterized activity of RsgA GTPase, several observations
suggested to us that additional E. coli proteins displace RbfA from 30S ribosomes. First,
RsgA is nonessential, and the level of RsgA is about tenfold less than the amount of
RbfA during logarithmic growth (Thurlow et al., 2016). Second, it is not known what
prevents RbfA from rebinding recycled 30S subunits. Additionally, the GTPase activity
of RsgA that is necessary for RbfA release was shown to be inhibited by (p)ppGpp
(Corrigan et al., 2016), which accumulates during stationary phase (Peterson et al.,
2005; Potrykus and Cashel, 2008). These observations suggested that E. coli employs
a second RbfA-release factor, especially under adverse conditions.
To test this possibility, we surveyed ribosome-associated proteins for their ability
to displace RbfA. Among the proteins tested, IF3 was uniquely able to release RbfA
from fully mature 30S subunits but not from immature pre-30S complexes. We also
found that RbfA inhibits protein synthesis by pre-30S subunits in the presence of IF3,
suggesting that RbfA acts as a gatekeeper to prevent premature entry of pre-30S
subunits into the translation cycle. Biochemical and genetics results further showed that
IF3 is essential for displacing RbfA during stationary phase. Altogether, the results
demonstrate that RbfA and IF3 enforce the barrier between ribosome biogenesis and
translation, creating a checkpoint that is sensitive to the quality of the 30S decoding site.

RESULTS:
The multi-functional initiation factor IF3 releases RbfA from 30S subunits
We employed an ultracentrifugation pelleting assay and an ultrafiltration assay
(Goto et al., 2011; Jeganathan et al., 2015; Shoemaker and Green, 2011) to investigate
the binding and release of RbfA from E. coli ribosomal 30S subunits under various
conditions. In order to distinguish RbfA from ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) of similar
size, we fluorescently labeled RbfA with Cy5 at position 2 (Figure S1A), which is
exposed in the NMR structure of RbfA (Huang et al., 2003) and is not essential for RbfA
function (Figure S1B). Fluorescent labeling enabled accurate quantitation of bound and
free RbfA.
In each pelleting assay or filtration assay, 30S•Cy5-RbfA complexes were
incubated with translation initiation factors or mRNA, and the bound Cy5-RbfA was
separated from the unbound protein by pelleting the reaction mixture through a sucrose
cushion or by filtration. In accordance with previous data (Goto et al., 2011), we
observed that RbfA remained bound to mature 30S subunits for tens of minutes (t1/2 >
30 min) (Figure S2A). This confirmed that RbfA forms long-lived complexes with free
30S subunits in the absence of other factors.
We next tested whether components of the translation initiation complex could
displace RbfA. Filtration and pelleting assays showed that neither r-protein bS1, which
acts during translation initiation, nor sodB mRNA could displace RbfA (Figure S2B, C).
RbfA also remained stably bound to 30S subunits in the presence of either IF1 or IF2
(Figure 1A, lanes 8 and 9 and Figure 1C). By contrast, we observed that RbfA
dissociated from 30S subunits in the presence of 4 µM IF3, as demonstrated by a >80%
decrease in the Cy5 fluorescence intensity in the pelleted fraction after
ultracentrifugation (Figure 1A, lane 10 and Figure 1C). The addition of IF1 or IF2 to
reactions with IF3 did not affect the ability of IF3 to promote dissociation of RbfA from
30S subunits, suggesting that IF3 acts alone on the 30S•RbfA complex (Figure S2A).
We confirmed that the ability of IF3 to remove RbfA depends on its association with the
30S subunit, since IF3-K110L, which does not bind 30S ribosomes (De Bellis et al.,
1992), was not able to remove RbfA (Figure 1B, lane 9 and Figure 1C). To confirm that
the RbfA release promoted by IF3 is meaningful, we compared this reaction to the

known RbfA release by the RsgA GTPase. RsgA was more efficient at RbfA release; in
the presence of 5 µM GTP, 500 nM RsgA was as effective as 4 µM IF3 (Figure 1B, lane
10 and Figure 1C). However, IF3 levels are typically ~20 times higher than RsgA levels
during logarithmic growth; relative to 30S subunits the approximate copy numbers are
100:20:8–10:1 30S:IF3:RbfA:RsgA (Gibbs et al., 2017; Howe and Hershey, 1983;
Liveris et al., 1991; Thurlow et al., 2016). Thus, these experiments suggested that IF3
provides an equally likely mechanism for removing RbfA from 30S subunits.
Conformational change of full length IF3 is required for RbfA release
IF3 is a 180 amino acid protein with two globular domains separated by a flexible
linker. The C-terminal domain, which performs many of the functions of full-length IF3
including selection of the correct start codon (Petrelli et al., 2001), can bind the 30S
subunit alone. The isolated N-terminal domain does not bind 30S subunits, but is
nonetheless required for wild-type growth (Ayyub et al., 2017). Upon binding to 30S
subunits, the N- and C-terminal domains of IF3 can adopt extended, intermediate, and
compact conformations, owing to the dynamics of the inter-domain linker that are
essential for IF3′s function in translation initiation (Elvekrog and Gonzalez, 2013).
Given these properties of IF3, we asked whether the conformational dynamics of
IF3 is needed to promote the release of RbfA from 30S subunits. We used the IF3
mutation Y75N, which is located in the highly conserved linker region and is known to
be critical for the start codon selection activity of IF3 (Maar et al., 2008; Sussman et al.,
1996). This mutation does not affect IF3 binding to 30S subunits, but it disfavors the
extended conformation of IF3 (Elvekrog and Gonzalez, 2013). We found that the Y75N
mutation reduced the amount of RbfA released compared to WT IF3 (Figure 2A and
2C), suggesting that IF3′s ability to fluctuate into the extended conformation is required
for optimal release of RbfA from 30S subunits. To completely abrogate the
conformational dynamics, we separated IF3 into N-terminal and C-terminal fragments
and tested their ability to remove RbfA from 30S subunits (Figure 2B and 2C). As
expected, the separated domains individually or in combination failed to remove RbfA
from 30S subunits, suggesting that conformational changes of the full-length IF3 are
important for displacing RbfA.

Timing the release of RbfA during 30S subunit biogenesis
To identify at which step RbfA acts during 30S biogenesis, we sought to
determine the influence of 30S subunit composition on the process of RbfA release by
IF3. We found that RbfA does not bind with naked 16S 5’ domain RNA, 16S or 17S
rRNA, nor with early 30S assembly intermediates reconstituted in vitro (Figure S3A, B,
and C), consistent with previous studies showing that RbfA acts during late 30S subunit
assembly or maturation (Connolly and Culver, 2013; Dammel and Noller, 1995; Datta et
al., 2007; Goto et al., 2011).
Late 30S assembly intermediates were purified from a △rbfA strain grown at low
temperature that causes pre-30S complexes to accumulate (ClatterbuckSoper et al.,
2013). These pre-30S particles contain unprocessed 17S pre-rRNA and lack some rproteins (Figure 3A). Cy5-RbfA was allowed to bind pre-30S particles as before, then
challenged with IF3, followed by ultracentrifugation. Although RbfA readily binds pre30S particles, IF3 was not able to promote the release of RbfA from these complexes.
Thus, IF3 preferentially releases RbfA from mature 30S subunits (Figure 3B), as shown
previously for RsgA (Goto et al., 2011).
To understand why RbfA could not be released from pre-30S subunits, we
compared the lifetimes of RbfA bound to pre-30S and mature 30S subunits by removing
free RbfA by ultrafiltration at various times. Figure 3C shows that the half-life of the pre30S•RbfA complex was > 60 min as observed previously (Goto et al., 2011), and was
unaffected by the presence of IF3. Whereas, the amount of RbfA bound to mature 30S
subunits significantly decreased after 20 min in the presence of IF3. These experiments
suggested that the structure of the pre-30S particles either stabilizes RbfA binding so
that it cannot be removed by IF3, or prevents IF3 from acting on the complex.
To test whether IF3 fails to release RbfA because IF3 cannot bind pre-30S
complexes, we monitored the release of Cy5-RbfA in the presence of Cy3-IF3, followed
by detection of Cy3 signal to determine whether IF3 was retained with the 30S or pre30S complexes after filtration. Both complexes were able to bind IF3 in the presence of
RbfA (Figure 3D). This result suggested that either conformational changes in the linker
of IF3 are compromised on pre-30S subunits, or that these conformational changes

occur but cannot dislodge RbfA from pre-30S subunits (Figure 3D, Lanes 10 and 11).
Importantly, in a similar experiment with mature 30S subunits, we observed that IF3
remains bound to 30S subunits after removing RbfA (Figure 3D, lanes 13 and 14).
Thus, IF3 can bind both mature and immature complexes, but cannot displace RbfA
from pre-30S particles.
We sought to determine if IF3 binds pre-30S particles in vivo by analyzing
purified pre-30S or 30S samples for the presence of IF3 by Western blotting (Figure
3E). The complexes were fractionated by sucrose gradient sedimentation and validated
by measuring rRNA and protein composition (as in Figure 3A). We found that IF3 copurifies with pre-30S subunits in an △rbfA strain. Additionally, IF3 was previously

detected by Western blotting in pre-30S particles in a △ybeY strain (Davies et al., 2010)

and by mass spectrometry in pre-30S particles containing 16S mutations that block
folding of a helix junction (Sharma et al., 2018) (Figure S4). Together, these data
confirmed that the interaction of IF3 with pre-30S particles is physiologically
measurable. Furthermore, pre-30S subunits have been found in 70S and polysome
fractions of △rbfA, △rimM, △ybeY, and △rpsO strains (ClatterbuckSoper et al., 2013;
Davies et al., 2010; Roy-Chaudhuri et al., 2010), suggesting that some pre-30S
complexes are competent for translation and therefore must interact with IF3.
RbfA release marks the transition from ribosome biogenesis to translation
initiation
Methylation of 16S A1518 and A1519 in H45 by the conserved RNA methylase
KsgA is thought to be one of the last steps in the 30S subunit biogenesis preceding
translation initiation (Connolly and Culver, 2013; Connolly et al., 2008; Thammana and
Held, 1974). Therefore, we wondered if H45 methylation promotes RbfA release by IF3.
First, we used primer extension to confirm that pre-30S complexes purified from an

∆rbfA strain are methylated by KsgA, as indicated by the presence of a reverse
transcription stop at residue A1519 (Figure 4A, lane 4). This showed that RbfA is not
required for H45 methylation, consistent with the proposal that RbfA acts downstream of
KsgA (Connolly and Culver, 2013).

Next, to determine whether H45 methylation is required for RbfA release, we
purified unmethylated near-mature 30S (nm30S) subunits from two strains lacking KsgA
activity:

∆ksgA deletion (Baba et al., 2006) and TPR201, which harbors a catalytically

dead ksgA allele (Andrésson and Davies, 1980). nm30S subunits purified from these
strains were not methylated at A1519 (Figure 4A, lanes 6 and 7), although they contain
the full complement of r-proteins (Connolly and Culver, 2013) and the mature 16S rRNA
5′ end (Figure S5A). Pelleting assays showed that RbfA was able to bind to these
nm30S particles, but its release by IF3 was compromised. IF3 was unable to promote
release of RbfA from nm30S subunits from the ∆ksgA strain, and only partially able to
release RbfA from TPR201 nm30S subunits (Figure 4B, upper panel and Figure 4C).
The absence of H45 methylation also reduced the ability of RsgA to release RbfA from
both types of nm30S subunits (Figure 4B, lower panel and Figure 4C). Thus, while
methylation by KsgA is not essential for RbfA recruitment, it is important for RbfA
release.
We next examined the difference in IF3 binding to nm30S subunits to determine
if this could explain IF3’s reduced ability to promote the release of RbfA from these
subunits. nm30S subunits from ∆ksgA and TPR201 strains were incubated with Cy5RbfA and Cy3-IF3 and then subjected to native PAGE (Figure 4D). We observed
colocalization of Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescence in the native gel for all of the 30S
complexes tested, indicating that IF3 and RbfA can both bind to methylated and nonmethylated 30S subunits. Furthermore, we observed FRET from Cy3-IF3 to Cy5-RbfA
(EFRET ~ 0.2 to 0.3), indicating that IF3 and RbfA can bind 30S, nm30S or pre-30S
complexes at the same time. IF3 interacted less tightly with unmethylated nm30S
subunits than with 30SWT subunits, however, judging from the intensities of individual
protein bands. Connolly & Culver (2013) also showed that IF3 binds less tightly to
nm30S subunits from ∆ksgA cells, supporting our observation. Together, these data
show that KsgA methylation of H45 enhances IF3 binding, and that methylation is
important for the efficient removal of RbfA from 30S subunits. These results explain why
RbfA overexpression is toxic to cells lacking KsgA (Connolly and Culver, 2013),
because RbfA cannot be released from nm30S subunits.

RbfA suppresses translation by pre-30S ribosomes
We previously observed that pre-30S ribosomes are partially active in protein
synthesis and enter the polysome fraction in an E. coli strain lacking RbfA
(ClatterbuckSoper et al., 2013), supporting the idea that RbfA normally prevents
translation by immature subunits. Since IF3 and RbfA can bind 30S subunits
simultaneously, we wondered if RbfA release is required for efficient translation
initiation. To test this, we compared the activity of pre-30S (∆rbfA), nm30S (∆ksgA and
TPR201) and mature 30S subunits in an in vitro translation assay using purified
components (Shimizu et al., 2001) in the presence or absence of excess RbfA (Figure
4E). Pre-30S∆rbfA subunits were intrinsically less active (29 ± 0.3%) than mature 30S
subunits, consistent with previous work (ClatterbuckSoper et al., 2013). In contrast,
nm30S subunits had normal activity. Importantly, the addition of RbfA substantially
inhibited translation by pre-30S∆rbfA and nm30S (∆ksgA and TPR201) complexes, while
it did not inhibit translation by WT 30SMRE600 subunits (Figure 4E). Increasing the
concentration of IF3 in the translation assay did not improve the translation efficiency for
any of the 30S complexes tested. We concluded that IF3’s inability to release RbfA from
immature particles (pre-30S∆rbfA, nm30S∆ksgA, and nm30STPR201), even when IF3 was
provided in excess, markedly decreased the activity of these subunits. These data
suggest that RbfA senses incomplete maturation of 30S subunits (as in case of pre30S∆rbfA and nm30S from ∆ksgA and TPR201 strains) and directly prevents their
premature entry into translation, providing a last checkpoint for ribosome biogenesis.
RbfA and IF3 are genetically linked
The results above show that IF3 can displace RbfA from mature 30S subunits in
vitro, but not from immature subunits. To determine if this activity of IF3 is important in
vivo, we looked for a genetic interaction between RbfA and IF3. Since IF3 is essential,
we used a non-lethal IF3-Y75N mutation (infC362; (Sussman et al., 1996)), which is
fortuitously defective in its ability to release RbfA from 30S subunits (Fig. 2A). Figure
5A shows that the infC362 strain grows similarly to the parental E. coli strain. When
these strains were transformed with a plasmid expressing RbfA (p15BHA), however,
leaky expression of RbfA in the absence of IPTG inhibited the growth of cells

expressing IF3-Y75N but not cells expressing wild type IF3 (Figure 5A). This level of
RbfA expression is enough to complement an E. coli ∆rbfA strain (Dammel and Noller,
1995), suggesting that RbfA and IF3 are genetically linked. The leaky expression of
RbfA was also toxic when the infC362 cells were grown in minimal media (Figure 5B),
which slows ribosome biogenesis and makes cells more dependent on ribosome
assembly factors. The genetic interaction between IF3 and RbfA was confirmed by plate
assays, which also showed that RbfA over-expression induces the cold sensitivity of
infC362 cells (Figure 5C). We concluded that wild type IF3 plays an important role in
removing RbfA from 30S subunits, which becomes even more important at low
temperature or when nutrients are limited.
To pinpoint the reason for RbfA toxicity in the IF3-Y75N background, the
polysome profile of infC362/p15BHA strain was compared with infC362 strain. Figure
5D shows that excess RbfA reduced the size of the 70S and polysome peaks, with a
concomitant increase in the amounts of free 30S and 50S ribosome subunits. This is
consistent with an inability of IF3-Y75N to displace RbfA, which in turn stabilizes free
30S subunits. This reduction in the numbers of active ribosomes was not due to a
defect in 30S biogenesis because we did not observe a defect in 16S rRNA 5′
processing as judged by primer extension (Figure S5B).
IF3 is the predominant pathway for RbfA release during stationary phase
Since the genetic interaction of IF3 and RbfA is stronger in low nutrient
conditions, we reasoned that IF3 may be the dominant factor that releases RbfA during
stationary phase, when the GTPase activity of RsgA is inhibited by (p)ppGpp (Corrigan
et al., 2016). To test this possibility, we measured RbfA release in a mixture containing
combinations of RsgA, GTP, ppGpp and IF3. We found that ppGpp inhibits the release
activity of RsgA by ~55% (Figure 6A, lane 10 and Figure 6B), yet did not inhibit IF3’s
ability to release RbfA from 30S subunits (Figure 6A, lane 11 and 12 and Figure 6B).
These data suggest that IF3 can promote the release of RbfA when ppGpp levels are
high enough to inhibit RsgA, as is the case during stationary phase.
Because ribosome biogenesis is sharply reduced in stationary phase or when
nutrients are limiting (Dennis and Bremer, 2008; Gourse et al., 1996; Murray et al.,

2003), we asked whether a checkpoint for biogenesis is needed under these conditions.
To measure the amount of ribosome biogenesis during stationary phase, we purified
total rRNA from cells in mid-log or stationary phase (Figure 6C) and measured the
amount of unprocessed 17S pre-rRNA by primer extension (ClatterbuckSoper et al.,
2013; Gupta and Culver, 2014). Immature 17S rRNA was present during both growth
stages tested, although the proportion of immature rRNA was three times lower during
stationary phase (2% vs. 6%; Figure 6D). We next tracked de novo ribosome synthesis
by pulse labeling the rRNA with 3H-uridine in cells in log phase (3 h, OD600nm ~0.6-0.8)
and stationary phase (10 h, OD600nm ~1.6-1.8), to determine whether newly synthesized
rRNA is assembled into mature ribosomes (Figure 6E). The numbers of ribosomes and
polysomes are expected to be lower in stationary phase (Reeve et al., 1984).
Nevertheless, after 10 min, newly formed tritiated ribosomal subunits were observed in
the polysome fractions from cells in stationary phase, indicating that ribosome
biogenesis continues even when nutrients are limiting (Figure 6E).
DISCUSSION
Here, we show that a translation initiation factor, IF3, robustly displaces RbfA, the
most abundant 30S subunit assembly factor in E. coli. Because RbfA is only released
from 30S subunits when assembly and maturation are complete, this suggests that the
opposing effects of RbfA and IF3 on pre-30S particles set up a checkpoint between 30S
biogenesis and protein synthesis (Figure 7). Each protein interacts with 16S H44
(decoding center), explaining how this checkpoint senses the assembly status of the
30S active site (Figure S6). After 30S maturation, a hand-off from RbfA to IF3
(30S•RbfA 30S•IF3) leads to formation of a 30S translation initiation complex.
RbfA as a gatekeeper for 30S ribosomes
During active growth conditions, bacteria must ensure the fidelity of translation by
preventing the entry of pre-30S particles into translation, which are inefficient and errorprone (Andrade et al., 2018; ClatterbuckSoper et al., 2013; Davies et al., 2010; RoyChaudhuri et al., 2010). We found that RbfA directly inhibits translation by immature
pre-30S particles (Figure 4E), providing a gatekeeping mechanism. Congruent with this

role, RbfA forms stable complexes with pre-30S subunits (Figure 3B, C) that are not
dissociated by either RsgA or IF3 (Figure 4B, C). In the cryo-EM structure of the
RbfA•30S complex, RbfA dislocates 16S helices H45 and the top of H44 (Datta et al.,
2007), preventing initiator tRNA binding and the formation of bridges B2a and B3 with
the 50S subunit. One possibility is that RbfA senses incomplete maturation of 30S
subunits by testing the stability of interactions around the 30S decoding center, which is
the last region of the 30S subunit to fold. This may also explain why RbfA release is
sensitive to KsgA methylation of A1518 and A1519, which stabilizes tertiary interactions
between H45 and H44 (Boehringer et al., 2012; Pedro Lopez-Alonso et al., 2017). In
yeast, late assembly factors were also suggested to prevent the premature entry of pre40S into translation cycle by blocking formation of the 43S pre-initiation complex (Strunk
et al., 2011).
Mechanism of RbfA release by IF3
It has been known for some time that RbfA does not bind with 70S ribosomes or
polysomes, indicating that RbfA is released from 30S subunits before they enter
translation (Connolly and Culver, 2013; Dammel and Noller, 1995; Goto et al., 2011;
Jones and Inouye, 1996). Our observation that RbfA does not interact with the 30S preinitiation complex (30SIC) (Figure S3D, lane 3) further suggested that RbfA is released
before or during initiation of translation. Although IF2 was previously reported to
genetically interact with RbfA (Jones and Inouye, 1996), in our assays, only IF3 is able
to release RbfA from mature 30S subunits (Figure 1 and S2).
Although our results don’t reveal how IF3 displaces RbfA from mature 30S
ribosomes, cryo-EM and single molecule FRET findings suggest a plausible pathway for
RbfA displacement (Figure S6). Cryo-EM structures showed that IF3 initially interacts
with the 30S subunit through its N-terminal domain which binds the platform near uS11
(Elvekrog and Gonzalez, 2013; Hussain et al., 2016). This interaction anchors IF3 to
30S subunits and allows for a conformational change within the linker region that
extends the C-terminal domain towards the top of H44, where it reinforces docking of
H44 and H45 and stabilizes the tRNA anti-codon in the P-site (Elvekrog and Gonzalez,
2013; Hussain et al., 2016; López-Alonso et al., 2017). Together these observations

suggest that IF3 and RbfA exert opposite and mutually exclusive effects on docking of
H44 and H45, which can explain how IF3 binding favors RbfA dissociation. In-cell
footprinting indicated that H44 is at least partially unfolded in free 30S subunits
(McGinnis et al., 2015) and completely undocked in pre-30S complexes
(ClatterbuckSoper et al., 2013), supporting the notion that this region of the 30S
ribosome can fluctuate between docked and undocked conformations.
By contrast with IF3, RsgA uses GTP hydrolysis to induce conformational
changes that promote the release of RbfA (Goto et al., 2011; Guo et al., 2011; Pedro
Lopez-Alonso et al., 2017; Razi et al., 2017). Although this likely requires folding and
docking of 16S H44 and H45, we cannot exclude the possibility that RsgA and IF3
displace RbfA by different mechanisms. An important difference is that RsgA itself
dissociates from the 30S complex upon GTP hydrolysis. By contrast, IF3 remains
bound after RbfA dissociates, and could be physiologically more important for
preventing RbfA rebinding and toxicity. This idea is further supported by the fact that the
N-terminal region of RsgA, which is important for RbfA release, is weakly conserved or
absent from many bacteria (Razi et al., 2017).
RbfA release by IF3 increases stress tolerance
Our data indicate that RbfA release by IF3 is even more critical at low
temperature and when nutrients are limited (Figure 5). Ribosome biogenesis continues
during stationary phase, albeit slowly (Figure 6D and E). However, as the GTPase
activity of RsgA is inhibited by rising levels of (p)ppGpp (Figure 6A and B), IF3 is
increasingly needed to remove RbfA from newly made 30S subunits. RsgA has been
shown to promote 70S ribosome dissociation into 30S and 50S subunits (Guo et al.,
2011; Himeno et al., 2004), which may explain why inhibition of RsgA by (p)ppGpp is
advantageous to the cell. During adaptation to low temperature and starvation, 70S
ribosomes can also enter hibernation by forming 100S dimers (Starosta et al., 2014;
Wada et al., 2000). Interestingly, IF3 is known to compete with hibernation factors for
binding to ribosomes following termination, suggesting a competition between recycling
and hibernation (Seshadri and Varshney, 2006; Yoshida et al., 2009). It will be

interesting to see which of these pathways is more important for maintaining cell
survival under stress conditions.
Translation using pre-30S subunits is a survival strategy under stress
When pre-30S particles accumulate during stress, they participate in translation
to ensure survival. The results of our in vitro translation assays support previous reports
that pre-30S complexes can enter the polysome pool in the absence of RbfA or when
30S assembly has stalled (ClatterbuckSoper et al., 2013; Davies et al., 2010; RoyChaudhuri et al., 2010). We suggest that when the accumulation of pre-30S subunits
exceeds RbfA concentrations, free pre-30S complexes which are competent can enable
translation under different adverse growth conditions (Figure 7).
Together, our data support a model in which RbfA normally prevents the
premature entry of pre-30S complexes into translation by exploiting the instability of 16S
rRNA interactions within the immature decoding site (Figure 7). After 30S maturation,
RbfA binding is destabilized, and RsgA or IF3 can release RbfA to keep up with the
demand for new 30S subunits during logarithmic growth. Since IF3 remains bound with
mature 30S subunits after RbfA release, the release of RbfA by IF3 therefore marks end
of ribosome biogenesis and beginning of translation initiation.

chloramphenicol. Inset: incorporation of 3H-uridine into polysomes.

Figure 7. A model depicting pathways involving release of RbfA from 30S
subunits
Under normal growth conditions (blue background), RbfA strongly interacts with
immature pre-30S particles and prevents their entry into translation. Both RsgA and IF3
can promote the release of RbfA from mature 30S subunits. However, when RsgA
releases RbfA, free 30S subunits can again bind to RbfA, leading to a futile cycle. 16S
H44 and H45 in free 30S subunits can fluctuate into an undocked state
(ClatterbuckSoper et al., 2013; McGinnis et al., 2015). By contrast, when IF3 releases
RbfA from mature 30S subunits, IF3 remains bound and ready to form a translation
initiation complex (30SIC). During stationary phase, RsgA is inhibited by (p)ppGpp and
RbfA is mainly released by IF3. Under stress (red background), when the pre-30S level
exceeds the amount of RbfA, some pre-30S complexes can also translate mRNAs.

Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and
will be fulfilled by Sarah A. Woodson (swoodson@jhu.edu).
METHOD DETAILS:
Strains and culture conditions
Strains are listed in the Key Resources Table. All bacterial strains were grown in
LB media unless stated otherwise. Media were supplemented with antibiotics (100
µg/ml ampicillin, 25 µg/ml kanamycin, 10 µg/ml tetracycline, and 100 µg/ml
kasugamycin) as required.
Growth analysis: E. coli strains JK382 (parental) and JK378 (infC362) were
transformed with either p15BHA over-expressing RbfA (Dammel and Noller, 1995;
Sussman et al., 1996) or with empty vector (pSE420), and were grown overnight at 37
ºC in LB media supplemented with 10 µg/ml tetracycline plus 100 µg/ml ampicillin.
These strains were sub-cultured in fresh media containing 50 µg/ml ampicillin and the
optical density (OD600nm) was recorded at the indicated intervals. For growth analysis
under nutrient limited conditions, cells were grown overnight as above and sub-cultured
into minimal media:1X MOPS (Teknova # M2101), 2 mM K2HPO4 (Teknova #M2102),
0.1 µg/ml thiamine, 0.4% glucose, supplemented with antibiotics as above as previously
reported (Mechold et al., 2002).
Plate assays
For plate assays, a single colony from a freshly prepared plate was re-streaked
on plates containing LB agar and antibiotics, and incubated at either 37 ºC or 18 ºC.
Plates were imaged after 1-3 days. For the rbfA complementation assay, p15B-RbfAA2C-HA was transformed into BX41 (∆rbfA) cells. MRE600, BX41 and (BX41/ p15BRbfA-A2C-HA) strains were grown on LB agar plates with no antibiotics, 25 µg/ml

kanamycin, and 100 µg/ml ampicillin plus 25 µg/ml kanamycin, respectively, in
duplicates. Plates were grown at 37 °C or 22°C, and imaged after 1-2 days.
Plasmids
Plasmids are listed in the Key Resources Table. QuikChange mutagenesis and
domain separation was carried out in pProEx-HTb-IF3 to obtain pProEx-HTb-IF3-K110L
(primers- IF3-K110L-F 5’AGGTATTACTCCGCAGCCTGATTC3’ and IF3-K110L-R
5’GGAGTAATACCTGATAGTCGCCTTC3’) and pProEx-HTb-IF3-Nter (primers- IF3Nter-F 5’TAACTCGAGGCATGCGG3’ and IF3-Nter-R
5’GATAACTTTTTGCTTTTTCTTCTG3’) and pProEx-HTb-IF3-Cter (primers- IF3-Cter-F
5’CAGGTTAAGGAAATTAAATTCCG3’ and IF3-Cter-R 5’AATGGATCCCATGGCG3’).
QuikChange mutagenesis was also carried out on plasmid p15BHA to obtain p15BRbfA-A2C-HA (primers- p15BHA-F
5’GAATAAACCATGGATGTGCAAAGAATTTGGTCGCC3’ and p15BHA-R
5’GGCGACCAAATTCTTTGCACATCCATGGTTTATTC3’) for the RbfA
complementation assay.
Ribosome purification
Mature ribosomes were purified from MRE600 following the protocol of
(Spedding, 1990). Near mature 30S (nm30S) subunits were isolated from JW0050-3
(∆ksgA) and TPR201 cells following the same protocol, except that the cell lysis was
performed in an ethanol-dry ice bath. Pre-30S subunits were purified as follows: BX41
(ΔrbfA) cells were grown in 5 ml LB at 37 °C for 9 h with shaking at 250 rpm. A 2 ml
aliquot was transferred to 200 ml LB supplemented with 25 µg/ml kanamycin and grown
overnight at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm. 50 ml of this culture was then transferred to
two flasks each containing 2 l LB supplemented with 25 µg/ml kanamycin. The cultures
were grown at 37 ˚C until O.D.600 ~0.7, after which the cultures were shifted to a shaking
incubator pre-cooled at 17 °C and grown until O.D.600 ~ 1.2 (ClatterbuckSoper et al.,
2013). The cultures were stored at 4 °C for 30 min before pelleting cells at 4,000 x g for
10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were washed once with 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 15 mM
MgCl2 and re-pelleted as above and stored at -20 °C until needed. The pellets were

resuspended in 15 ml lysis buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 15 mM MgCl2 and
1 mg/ml lysozyme (hen egg white; Sigma #L7651) (freshly prepared). The cells were
incubated for 5 min with intermittent vortexing, frozen in an ethanol-dry ice bath, and
allowed to thaw at room temperature. Cell lysates were cleared twice by centrifugation
at 20,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C. 10-40% sucrose gradients in 60 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5,
30 mM MgCl2, 300 mM NH4Cl, 6 mM DTT, 3 mM β-mercaptoethanol were prepared in
SW28 rotor tubes (Beckman Coulter) using a gradient master (BioComp). An equal
quantity of cleared lysate (OD260nm ~100) was layered onto each gradient and spun at
25,000 rpm for 2 hours at 4 °C (SW28 rotor; Beckman Coulter). The fraction
corresponding to pre-30S particles was collected using a fractionator (BioComp) and
analyzed for the presence of 17S rRNA on a 1.5% agarose-TAE gel. The protein
component was analyzed by 4-20% SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad #4561093). Pooled fractions
were concentrated using 100 kDa MWCO ultrafiltration tubes (Millipore # UFC510096)
and exchanged 3-5 times with buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, 40 mM NH4Cl, 60 mM
KCl, 10 mM MgCl2). Aliquots were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C
until further use.
Protein purification and fluorescence labeling
E. coli proteins S1, RbfA, RsgA, IF1, IF2, and IF3 (WT, mutant and domains) with
histidine tags were purified from BL21(DE3) cells harboring the respective plasmids
listed in the Key Resources Table. Over-expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG at 37
°C. Pellets were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, 500 mM NaCl) using
sonication, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 x g for 20 min.
Cleared lysates were passed through a 5 ml HiTrap Ni-column (GE Healthcare
#17040901) pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was washed with 25 column
volumes of lysis buffer containing 30 mM imidazole and 25 column volumes of lysis
buffer with 30 mM imidazole plus 1 M NaCl. His-tagged protein was eluted using lysis
buffer plus 500 mM imidazole. Protein-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed in
50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 300 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 6 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 10%
glycerol after the purity was checked by SDS PAGE. For fluorophore labeling, the
protein of interest containing a single cysteine was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 80

mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 M KCl, 1 mM TCEP. A maleimide conjugate of Cy5 or Cy3 dye
(GE Healthcare#PA25031, PA23031) was dissolved in anhydrous DMSO (Molecular
Probes #D12345), mixed with the protein of interest following the manufacturer’s
instruction and incubated for 2-3 h at room temperature in the dark. Reactions were
quenched with 6 mM β –mercaptoethanol, and the labeled protein was re-purified
through Ni-column, concentrated in 3 kDa MWCO filtration units (Millipore#UFC900324)
and exchanged with dialysis buffer as described above. Subsequently, concentrated
proteins were dialyzed a second time against a large excess of dialysis buffer,
aliquoted, snap frozen and stored at –80 °C. The labeling efficiency and concentration
were checked by UV absorption (Nanodrop; Thermo Scientific). IF3 was used before
and after removing the histidine tag by TEV protease.
Ultracentrifugation pelleting assay and Ultrafiltration assay
200 nM pre-30S or 30S subunits was incubated with 400 nM Cy5-RbfA in buffer
A with 3 mM DTT (Buffer A*) for 15 min at 37 °C (300 µL total volume is sufficient for 6
pelleting assays). Unbound Cy5-RbfA was removed by passing the reaction mixture
through a 100 kDa MWCO filtration unit (Millipore#UFC510096) for 5 min at 10,000 x g.
The filter was washed twice with 200-400 µl buffer A* by centrifugation as above and
the complexes were recovered by centrifugation at 1,000 x g following the
manufacturer’s instructions. To monitor the release of Cy5-RbfA in a pelleting assay
(Jeganathan et al., 2015; Shoemaker and Green, 2011), the pre-30S or 30S•Cy5-RbfA
complex (50 µL) was incubated with excess IF1/IF2/IF3/mRNA/S1 (individually or in
combination) in buffer A* for 15 min at 37 °C in a 100 µl reaction volume. 10 µl of this
mixture was saved as “input” and 90 µl was separated through a 2 ml 1.1 M sucrose
cushion in buffer A by ultracentrifugation in a SW50 rotor (Beckman Coulter). The pellet
was dissolved in 30 µl buffer A*, and 10 µl of the input and pellet samples was mixed
with 2 µl 2X Tricine loading dye (Bio-Rad#161-0739) and boiled for 2 min at 95 °C and
resolved by 4-20% SDS PAGE. Gels were scanned for Cy5 signal using a Typhoon
imager (GE Healthcare) and quantified using ImageQuant (GE Healthcare) before
staining with Coomassie blue. For monitoring release with a filtration assay as
previously described (Goto et al., 2011; Jeganathan et al., 2015), unbound Cy5-RbfA

was removed from the release reaction mixture by passing the reaction mixtures again
through a 100 kDa MWCO filtration unit as above, and input and retentate was further
processed similar to pelleting assay.
30S assembly intermediates were prepared by mixing 100 nM 17S rRNA
(transcribed) with purified recombinant primary assembly r-proteins (S4, S7, S8, S15,
S17, and S20) or primary plus secondary r-proteins (S4, S7, S8, S15, S17, and S20
plus S6, S16, S9, S13, S18, and S19) (200 nM) as previously described (Culver and
Noller, 1999; Traub and Nomura, 2006) in HKM20 buffer (80 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 330
mM KCl, and 20 mM MgCl2) at 42 °C for 1 h. 17S rRNA or native 30S subunits was
also incubated with Cy5-RbfA separately as controls. The reaction mixtures were then
layered onto 1.1 M sucrose cushions and analyzed as described above.
Primer extension
Primer extension on total RNA extracted from E. coli (BW25113) and BX41 (∆rbfA) or
rRNA purified from 30S fractions was performed using primers 5′ labeled with either
32

P-or Cy5. The 16S 5′ end was analyzed with primer 161

(5’GCGGTATTAGCTACCGT3’) or primer 323 (5’ AGTCTGGACCGTGTCTC3’) as
described previously (ClatterbuckSoper et al., 2013). For checking the methylation of
16S A1518 and A1519, 5′-32P-labeled primer 1523 (5’GGAGGTGATCCAACCGC3’)
(Seistrup et al., 2017) was used on rRNA purified from immature and mature 30S
subunits. In all cases, the rRNA was purified using RNeasy kit (Qiagen# 74104).
In vitro translation assay
Purified pre-30S, nm30S or 30S subunits and native 50S subunits were
incubated with or without 3 µM RbfA and combined with in vitro translation components
(PURExpress; New England Biolabs # E3313S). Each reaction mixture (15-20 µl) was
supplemented with 1 µl 35S methionine (1 µCi, Perkin Elmer #NEG009T001MC) and 1
µl RNase inhibitor (Promega#N2615) and incubated at 37 ºC for 2 h in an incubator.
The reaction was stopped by placing tubes on ice for 5 min, followed by the addition of
2 µl 2X Tricine loading dye (Bio-Rad#161-0739). 8-10 µl of each reaction was loaded

without boiling onto a 4-20% SDS PAGE. The gel was then dried under vacuum,
exposed overnight against a phosphor screen and imaged using a Typhoon scanner.

H-Uridine pulse labeling and polysome profiling
BW25113 cells were first grown overnight in LB at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm,

then transferred to fresh 5 ml LB at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm. After 3 h or after 10
h, 50 µl 3H-Uridine (50 µCi, PerkinElmer#NET174001MC) was added to the culture,
which was allowed to grow for another 9 min, before the addition of 25 µg/ml
chloramphenicol for 1 min. Cells were harvested, washed with cold 10 mM Tris-HCl
pH7.5 and 15 mM MgCl2, and pellets stored at –80 °C. To analyze polysome profiles,
cell lysate was prepared as above. Equal amounts of cleared lysate containing total
ribosomes (OD260nm ~20) was separated through 10-40% sucrose gradient in the buffer
as above for 2.5 h at 35,000 rpm in a SW41 rotor (Beckman Coulter). The gradients
were analyzed using a fractionator (Biocomp) and the A260nm recorded. Fractions (250
µl) covering the entire gradient were collected in 96-well plate and 3H-uridine
incorporation was measured by liquid scintillation counting (Beckman). rRNA analysis
was performed using primer extension as described above.
Western blot
Western blot analysis was performed as previously described (Connolly and Culver,
2013; Goto et al., 2011). Briefly, reaction mixtures (0.5-1 µg), cell lysates (40-60 µg) or
30S fractions (5-10 µg) (concentrated using 3 kDa MWCO filtration tubes) from
polysome profiling experiments were separated by 4-20% SDS PAGE and transferred
to a PVDF membrane (Novex#LC2002) and probed with polyclonal antibodies against
IF3. Antibody binding was detected using a secondary goat anti-rabbit WesternDot-655
antibody (ThermoFisher, W10814), following the manufacturer’s protocol. Membranes
were imaged using a Typhoon scanner.
Native PAGE experiments
Co-localization assays were performed by incubating Cy5-RbfA and Cy3-IF3,
together or separately, with or without pre-30S (∆rbfA), 30S (MRE600), nm30S (∆ksgA)

or nm30S (TPR201) subunits (100 nM each reactant) in buffer A* for 15 min at 37 ºC in
a 10 µl reaction mixture. 2 µl native loading dye (50% sucrose, 0.02% bromophenol
blue) was added before loading 8 µl on a native 4% PAGE (acrylamide: bis-acrylamide
37.5:1, Bio-Rad#1610148). The gel was run at ~15.5 ºC for ~45 min in 1X THEM buffer
(56 mM Hepes-K+, 34 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA) before
scanning with 532 nm excitation (Cy3) and an emission filter at 610 nm for FRET
(Typhoon). The FRET efficiency (E) was calculated from (Sabanayagam et al., 2004).

where ‫ܫ‬஺஽ is the intensity of the acceptor in the presence of the donor (i.e. FRET) and ‫ܫ‬஽
is the intensity of the donor. The gels were also imaged with 633 nm excitation (Cy5).
For binding of RbfA with the 16S rRNA 5’ domain, an extended 5’domain RNA
was transcribed and annealed with Cy3-SA5 oligonucleotide as previously described
(Abeysirigunawardena et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2014). The 5′ domain•Cy3-SA5 complex
was incubated with Cy5-RbfA, with or without 5’ domain binding ribosomal proteins (S4,
S17, S20, and S16), at 37 °C for 15 min in HKM20 buffer. For measuring binding of
RbfA with 16S (native) or 17S rRNA (transcribed), increasing concentrations of 16S (10100 nM) or 17S (20-100 nM) rRNA was incubated with 100 nM Cy5-RbfA at 37 °C for
15 min in HKM20 buffer. The complexes were resolved and analyzed as described
above.
For binding of RbfA with the 30S translation initiation complex (30SIC), 30S
subunits were first incubated at 42 °C for 30 min in an initiation complex buffer (ICB)
containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 70 mM NH4Cl, 30 mM KCl, 7 mM MgCl2 as
previously described (Julián et al., 2011). The initiation complex was formed by
combining 100 nM 30S subunits, 500 nM mRNA (sodB), 300 nM fMet-tRNAfmet, 300 nM
each IF1, IF2 and IF3, and 300 nM GTP in ICB at 37 °C for 15 min. Subsequently, 100
nM Cy5-RbfA was incubated with 50 nM initiation complex in ICB at 37 °C for 15 min. 2
µl native loading dye was added and the reaction mixtures were resolved and analyzed
as described above.
