The temperature-response was highly heritable (H2 = 0.81) and positively related to a later
start and end of stem elongation as well as an increased final height (FH). Genome-wide
association mapping revealed three temperature-responsive and four temperatureirresponsive QTL. Furthermore, putative candidate genes for temperature-response QTL were
frequently related to the flowering pathway in A. thaliana while temperature–irresponsive
QTLs corresponded with growth and reduced height genes. These loci, together with the loci
for start and end of stem elongation accounted for 49% of the variability in height.

This demonstrates how high throughput field phenotyping in combination with environmental
covariates can contribute to a smarter selection of climate-resilient crops.

In wheat, the timing and dynamics of stem elongation are tightly linked to temperature. It is
yet unclear if and how these processes are genetically controlled. We aimed to identify
quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling temperature-response during stem elongation and to
evaluate their relationship to phenology and height. Canopy height of the GABI wheat panel
was measured between 2015 and 2017 in bi-weekly intervals in the field phenotyping platform
(FIP) using a LIDAR. Temperature-response was modelled using a linear regression between
stem elongation and the mean interval temperature.

Introduction

38

The critical phase for yield formation in wheat is stem elongation (SE); happening between
the phenological stages of terminal spikelet initiation and anthesis (Slafer et al., 2015). The
1

Temperature is a major abiotic factor affecting plant growth and development. As a
consequence of Global warming, wheat production could decrease by 6% per °C global
temperature increase (Asseng et al., 2015). While heat stress during critical stages can
drastically reduce yield (Gibson and Paulsen, 1999; Farooq et al., 2011), warm temperatures
can decrease yield by accelerating development and thereby shortening critical periods for
yield formation (Fischer, 1985; Slafer and Rawson, 1994). However little is known about how
temperature affects development and growth, and how this is genetically controlled.

start of SE coincides with the transition from vegetative to reproductive development, when
the apex meristem differentiates from producing leaf primordia to producing spikelet
primordia (Trevaskis et al., 2007; Kamran et al., 2014). During SE, florets are initiated at the
spikelets until booting (Kirby, 1988; Slafer et al., 2015). An increased duration of stem
elongation increases the number of fertile florets due to longer spike growth and higher dry
matter partitioning to the spike (González et al., 2003). This in turn increases the number of
grains per spike and therefore yield (Fischer, 1985). Modifying the timing of the critical
phenological stages (transition to early reproductive phase and flowering) and SE duration has
been proposed as way to increase wheat yield or at least mitigate adverse climate change
effects on yield (Slafer et al., 1996; Miralles and Slafer, 2007; Whitechurch et al., 2007). The
recent warming trend causes a faster advancement in phenology. For example over the past
decade flowering time occurred earlier in Germany, which is attributable to both, increased
temperature and selection for early flowering (Rezaei et al., 2018).

Final height is also an important yield determinant. During the “green revolution” wheat yields
increased by the introduction of reduced height genes (Rht). The resulting dwarf and semi
dwarf varieties benefit from improved resource allocation from the stem to the spike and
reduced lodging, allowing more intensive nitrogen application (Hedden, 2003). Gibberellin
insensitive Rht genes (Rht-A1, Rht-B1, and Rht-D1) were shown limit cell wall extensibility
which decreases growth rates (Keyes et al., 1989) without affecting development (Youssefian
et al., 1992). Whilst the allele Rht-B1c (Wu et al., 2011) and the GA sensitive Rht12 dwarfing
gene (Chen et al., 2013) delay heading.

The main abiotic factors affecting the timing of floral initiation and flowering are temperature
and photoperiod; with temperature affecting both vernalisation and general rate of
development (Slafer et al., 2015). These developmental transitions are controlled by major
genes involved in the flowering pathway, namely; vernalisation (VRN), photoperiod (PPD) and
earliness per se (EPS) genes (Slafer et al., 2015). The PPD and VRN genes define photoperiod
and vernalisation requirements which jointly enable the transition to generative development
and define time to flowering. Whereas EPS genes fine tune the timing of floral transition and
flowering, after vernalisation and photoperiod requirements are fulfilled (Zikhali and Griffiths,
2015). While vernalisation and photoperiod response are well known, the role of temperature
per se remains less clear. Temperature affects all developmental phases and warmer ambient
temperatures generally accelerate growth and development in crops (Slafer and Rawson,
1994, 1995a,c; Atkinson and Porter, 1996; Fischer, 2011; Slafer et al., 2015). But it is unclear,
if temperature-response governs growth rate and development independently. If so, the
question remains whether there is enough genetic variability in temperature-response to be
used in a breeding context (Parent and Tardieu, 2012).

Genotypic variation for growth response to temperature was reported for wheat leaf
elongation rate (Nagelmüller et al., 2016), as well as for canopy cover growth (Grieder et al.,
2015). Kiss et al. (2017) reported significant genotype by temperature interactions in the
timing of stem elongation as well as temperature dependent differences in the expression of
VRN and PPD genes under controlled conditions. Under field conditions, the response of stem
elongation to temperature has not yet been investigated in high temporal resolution.

In recent years, new high throughput phenotyping technologies have enabled monitoring
plant height with high accuracy and frequency in the field (Bendig et al., 2013; Friedli et al.,
2016; Holman et al., 2016; Aasen and Bareth, 2018; Hund et al., 2019). We have previously
demonstrated that the ETH field phenotyping platform (FIP, Kirchgessner et al., 2016) can be
used to accurately track the development of canopy height in a large set of wheat genotypes
using terrestrial laser scanning (Kronenberg et al., 2017). Considerable genotypic variation was
detected for the start and end of SE which correlated positively with final canopy height
(Kronenberg et al., 2017).

While many temperature-independent factors affecting plant height are known, the
influences of temperature-dependent elongation and timing of the elongation phase is less
clear. To address this, we aimed to dissect final height into the following components: i)
temperature-independent elongation, ii) temperature-dependent elongation and iii) the
duration of the elongation phase determining by the start and end of the process. To achieve
this we present a method to assess and measure these three processes under field conditions
by means of high-frequency, high-throughput phenotyping of canopy height development.
The resulting data were combined with genetic markers to identify quantitative trait loci
controlling the aforementioned processes.

Field experiments were conducted in the field phenotyping platform FIP at the ETH research
station in Lindau-Eschikon, Switzerland (47.449°N, 8.682°E, 520 m a.s.l.; soil type: eutric
cambisol). We used a set of approximately 330 winter wheat genotypes (335 – 352 depending
on the experiment) comprising current European elite cultivars (GABI Wheat; Kollers et al.,
2013), supplemented with thirty Swiss varieties. These were monitored over three growing
seasons in 2015, 2016 and 2017. Details about the experimental setup for the growing seasons
2015 and 2016 are described in Kronenberg et al. (2017). Briefly, the field experiments were
conducted in an augmented design with two replications per genotype using micro plots with
a size of 1.4 by 1.1 m. In the growing season 2017, the experiment was repeated again, with
minor changes in genotypic composition. This resulted in 328 genotypes present across all
three experiments.

Canopy height was measured twice weekly from the beginning of shooting (BBCH 31) until
final height using a light detection and ranging (LIDAR) scanner (FARO R Focus3D S 120; Faro
Technologies Inc., Lake Mary USA) mounted on the FIP (Kirchgessner et al., 2016). Canopy
height data was extracted from the LIDAR data as described in Kronenberg et al. (2017). Spatial
heterogeneity at each measuring date was corrected by applying two-dimensional P-splines
to the raw canopy height data within each year using the R-package SpATS (Rodríguez-Álvarez
et al., 2018). The start, end, and duration of stem elongation with final canopy height (FH)
were extracted from the height data as described by Kronenberg et al. (2017): Normalized
canopy height was calculated as percent of final height at each day of measurement for every
plot and then linearly interpolated between measurement points. Growing degree-days until
15% final height (GDD15) and 95% final height (GDD95) were used as proxy traits for start and
end of stem elongation, respectively. SE duration was recorded in thermal time (GDDSE) as

well as in calendar days (timeSE), as the difference between GDD95 and GDD15 (Kronenberg et
al., 2017).

125

In order to investigate short-term growth response to temperature, average daily stem
elongation rates (SER) were calculated for each plot as the difference (∆) in canopy height (CH)
between consecutive timepoints (t):

where T is the ambient temperature, a is the coefficient of the linear regression (i.e. growth
response to ambient temperature; slpSER~T) and ε denotes the residual error. bTcrit is the model
intercept, estimated at the temperature, at which the correlation between intercept and slope
is zero (intSER~T). Tcrit was determined empirically for each year by sequentially estimating the
intercept between 1°C and 22°C Fig. 1A). Per definition, the intercept would be estimated at
T = 0 °C, i.e. far outside the range of observed temperatures. In the observed data, an intercept
at T = 0°C correlated strongly negative with the slope (Fig. 1A) and, thus, did not add much
additional information concerning the performance of the evaluated genotypes. Grieder et al.
(2015) performed a similar analysis for the canopy cover development during winter and
found a similar, strongly negative correlation between temperature-response (slope) and
growth at 0°C (intercept). Likewise an intercept at 20°C at the upper range of the observed
data was correlated strongly positive with the slope. Hence, Tcrit is the turning point from
negative to positive correlation as the position of the intercept increases, which is the point
where intercept and slope are independent. Therefore, two genotypes can show the same
growth at Tcrit but differ markedly in temperature-response (Fig. 1B), have the same
temperature-response but differ in growth at Tcrit (Fig. 1C), or differ for both, intercept and
slope (Fig. 1D). Following this, intSER~T would be interpreted as intrinsic, temperatureindependent growth, hereinafter referred to as “vigour”.

Statistical Analysis

All statistical analysis were performed in the R environment (R Core Team, 2018). Best linear
unbiased estimations (BLUEs), predictors (BLUPs) and broad sense heritabilities (H2) were
determined for all traits using the R-package asreml (Butler, 2009). In a first step, BLUEs were
calculated within each year using:

157

𝑌 = 𝜇+𝑔+ 𝜀

Where Y is the respective trait (FH, GDD15, GDD95, GDDSE, intSER~T or slpSER~T), μ is the overall
mean, g the fixed genotype effect and 𝜀 is the residual error.

In a second step, 3-year BLUPs were calculated using

where Y are the single-year BLUEs for the respective traits derived from eq. 3, μ is the overall

The 3-year BLUPs of GDD15, GDD95, GDDSE, FH, intSER~T, and slpSER~T were used for correlations
and genome wide association study (GWAS).

The genetic basis of temperature-response was investigated by GWAS. GWAS was performed
on the different traits to compare the phenotypic correlations with the underlying genetic
architecture of the traits. As a positive control final height data made in Germany and France
by Zanke et al. (2014b) was also compared and analysed.

Genotyping data was made previously by the GABI wheat consortium represented by the
Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research (IPK; Zanke et al., 2014a) using the
90K illumina SNP-chip (Cavanagh et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014). Monomorphic SNPs were
discarded. The remaining markers were mapped to the IWGSC reference genome (Consortium
(IWGSC) et al., 2018) by BLASTN search using an E-value threshold < 1e-30. The genome
position with the lowest E-value was assigned as the respective marker location. Markers that
could not be unequivocally positioned were dropped. After filtering SNPs with a minor allele
frequency and missing genotype rate < 0.05, a total of 13,450 SNP markers and 315 genotypes
remained in the set. The reference genome position of RHT, PPD, VRN and putative EPS genes
was determined with BLASTN search as described above using published GenBank sequences
(Table S1).

We used a mixed linear model (MLM) including principal components among marker
alleles as fixed effects and kinship as random effect to account for population
structure (Zhang et al., 2010). This approach was chosen to stringently prevent type I
errors. The MLM GWAS was performed using the R Package GAPIT (v.2, Tang et al.,
2016). Kinship was estimated according to VanRaden (2008).
In a generalised linear model (GLM) framework implemented in PLINK (Purcell et al.,
2007), association analysis was performed using SNP haplotype blocks consisting of
adjacent SNP triplets. Using haplotype blocks takes the surrounding region of a given
SNP into account, thus increasing the power to detect rare variants (Purcell et al.,
2007)
Finally, the FarmCPU method (Liu et al., 2016) was used, which is also implemented in
GAPIT. FarmCPU tests individual markers with multiple associated markers as

covariates in a fixed effect model. Associated markers are iteratively used in a random
effect model to estimate kinship. Confounding between testing markers and kinship
is thus removed while controlling type I error, leading to increased power (Liu et al.,
2016).

For all methods, a Bonferroni correction was applied to the pointwise significance threshold
of α = 0.05, to avoid false-positives. Hence, only markers above –log10(P-value) >= 5.43
considered significant.

Linkage disequilibrium (LD) among markers was estimated using the squared correlation
coefficient (r2) calculated with the R package SNPrelate (Zheng et al., 2012). A threshold of r2
= 0.2 (Gaut and Long, 2003) was applied to calculate the chromosome specific distance
threshold of LD decay. Putative candidate genes were identified by searching the IWGSC
annotation of the reference genome (Consortium (IWGSC) et al., 2018) for genes associated
with growth and development within the LD distance threshold around the respective MTA.

We measured the canopy height of 710 – 756 plots per year, containing 335 – 352 wheat
genotypes, for three consecutive years. In each season measurements were made between
17 and 22 times during stem elongation. Thus resulting in an average of 122 canopy height
measurement points per genotype. From these data we extracted growth rates and the timing
of critical stages. Plot based growth rates within single years indicate a clear relation between
growth and temperature for the period of stem elongation, as depicted in Fig. 2. Towards the
end of the measurement period in June, there was a larger deviation, which was also reflected
in the quality of plot based linear model fits of SER versus temperature (see eq. 2), summarized
in Fig. S1. For the 2015 and especially the 2016 experiment, R2 values were low and except for
the 2017 experiment, the parameter estimates were not statistically significant (Fig. S1A).
Inspection of the best and worst model fits however shows, that failure of fitting the model
for single plots was levelled out by the replications within genotypes (Fig. S1B), therefore
allowing for confident estimates of genotypic means of the model parameters (see below).
Analysis of variance revealed significant (P < 0.001) genotypic effects for both slpSER~T and
intSER~T within single years as well as across three years. Both traits showed high heritabilities
across years (H2 = 0.81 for slpSER~T and H2 = 0.77 for intSER~T) and very high heritabilities within
single years (Table 1). Using the BLUPs of slpSER~T, intSER~T and temperature sum for stem
elongation (GDDSE), final height could be predicted with high accuracy across different years
(0.82 <= R2 <= 0.85) by training a linear model on the BLUPs of one year and predicting it on
the BLUPs of another independent year. Training the model on the 3-year BLUPs resulted in a
prediction accuracy of single years between R2 = 0.93 and R2= 0.95 (Fig. 3). High heritabilities
within years (0.75 <= H2 <= 0.99) as well as across three years (0.54 <= H2 <= 0.98; Table 1),
were also found for other traits; final height, start of SE, end of SE and SE duration.

To evaluate the relationships between the traits measured, Pearson correlation coefficients
were calculated for each trait pair. If not indicated otherwise, the reported correlations were
highly significant (P < 0.001)

245
246

Positive correlations were found among GDD15, GDD95 and FH (0.36 <= r <= 0.64, Fig. 4),
indicating that taller varieties were generally later. Temperature response (slpSER~T) and vigour
(intSER~T) also showed a strong, positive relationship with final height (r = 0.85 and r = 0.65,
respectively). However, only temperature-response correlated with GDD15 and GDD95 (r = 0.63
and r = 59, respectively), whereas vigour did not (r < 0.26, Fig. S2).

As expected, stem elongation duration in thermal time (GDDSE) was negatively correlated with
GDD15 (r = -0.44) and positively correlated with GDD95 (r = 0.4). But, GDDSE did not correlate
with final height (r = -0.01, P = 0.878) or temperature-response (r = 0.006, P = 0.289). Although
GDDSE negatively correlated with vigour (r = -0.32). In contrast, SE duration in calendar days
(timeSE) was negatively correlated with temperature-response (r = -0.35) and GDD15 (r = -0.82),
indicating a longer SE phase for earlier genotypes. Other weak correlations (r < 0.3), that are
not discussed, are shown in Fig. S2.

Prior to MTA analysis we evaluated population structure and LD. Principal component analysis
of the marker genotypes revealed no distinct substructure in the investigated population. The
biplot of the first two principal components showed no apparent clusters, with the first
component explaining 8% and the second component explaining 3.3% of the variation in the
population (Fig. S5). This is consistent with prior work using the same population (Kollers et
al., 2013; Yates et al., 2018). On average across all chromosomes, LD decayed below an r2 of
0.2 at a distance of 9 MB. There was however considerable variation in this threshold among
the single chromosomes (Table S2).

Genome-wide association results differed markedly depending on the applied model. Using a
MLM with kinship matrix and PCA as covariates resulted in no significant MTA for any trait
(Fig. S3). In contrast, the GLM using the haplotype method yielded 2949 significant MTA for α
< 0.05 and 1846 MTA for α < 0.001 respectively. However, investigation of the respective QQplots showed large P-value inflation in the haplotype method whereas the P-values were
slightly deflated when using the MLM approach (Fig. S3, Fig. S4). In contrast, with FamCPU the
QQ-plots (Fig. 5) showed no P-value inflation, except for some markers. This pattern is
expected, if population structure is appropriately controlled. Therefore, FarmCPU was chosen
to be the most appropriate method for the given data, despite identifying less significant MTA.

As a positive control we compared our final height data and associated markers with data
made by Zanke et al. (2014b). Final canopy height correlated strongly between the two studies
(r = 0.95), which is in accordance with the high heritability of the trait. In this study, we found
11 significant MTA for final height (Table 2, Fig. 5). Zanke et al. (2014b) reported 280 significant
MTA for final height across several environments. Of these, only marker
RAC875_rep_c105718_585 on chromosome 4D overlapped with the MTA found in this study.
However, by considering flanking markers, we found that of the remaining ten significant MTA

for final height, six were in LD with MTA found by Zanke et al. (2014b; Table S3). The significant
MTA found for FH in this study are near known genes controlling FH. For example,
Tdurum_contig64772_417, is 4 MB upstream of Rht-B1 and RAC875_rep_c105718_585, is 7
MB downstream of Rht-D1 on their respective group 4 chromosomes.

For slpSER~T we detected one significant (LOD = 5.77) MTA on chromosome 1B
(wsnp_Ex_c1597_3045682) and two almost significant (LOD = 5.39 / LOD = 5.02) MTA on
chromosomes 4B (CAP7_c10839_300) and 5D (IAAV7104), respectively (Fig. 5). All associated
markers for slpSER~T yielded small but significant allelic effects ranging from -0.049 mm °C-1d-1
to -0.041 mm °C-1d-1 (Table 2). The GWAS for intSER~T yielded four significant MTA on
chromosomes 2B, 4B, 4D and 5D respectively (Table 2, Fig. 5). Start and end of SE yielded four
MTA each (Table 2, Fig. 5).

Comparing the GWAS results for temperature-response, vigour, final height, GDD15 and GDD95
revealed no common quantitative trait loci (QTL) between slpSER~T and any other trait. Only
one marker (Excalibur_c74858_243) was significantly associated with both GDD15 as well as
GDD95. The lack of overlap, of MTA, between temperature-response, vigour and timing of
critical stages indicate they are genetically independent. However, there is a genetic
connection between vigour and FH on the one hand and between the start and end of stem
elongation on the other.

To identify potential causative genes underlying the QTL, we searched the reference genome
annotation around the respective QTL intervals. For temperature-response we found an
increased presence of genes or gene homologues involved in the flowering pathway, i.e.
EARLY FLOWERING 3, FRIGIDA and CONSTANS (Table 3). Around the QTL associated with
vigour the annotation showed genes associated with growth (i.e. GRAS, CLAVATA, BSU1,
Argonaute) as well as developmental progress (i.e. Tesmin/TSO1-like CXC domain, BEL1,
AGAMOUS (Table 4). Importantly, we found GAI-like protein 1 6MB upstream of marker
Kukri_rep_c68594_530, which we identified as RHT-D1 by blasting the RHT-D1 sequence
(GeneBank ID AJ242531.1) against the annotated reference genome.

The phenotypic correlations show a strong connection between temperature-response,
vigour and FH as well as weaker connections between GDD15, GDD95 and FH. In order to
examine this interdependency on a genetic level, we used a linear model to predict FH with
the SNP alleles of the QTL for slpSER~T, intSER~T, GDD15 and GDD95 as predictors. The model was
able to predict FH with an accuracy R2 = 0.49, with significant contributions by QTL of all three
traits (Fig. 6, Table 5).

Discussion
In this study we present a method to measure temperature response during stem elongation
of wheat using high throughput phenotyping of canopy height in the field. The results show a
highly heritable genotype-specific ambient temperature response of wheat which affects both
growth and timing of the developmental key stages. We modelled temperature-response in a

simple linear framework with the intercept estimated at the temperature of zero correlation
to the slope. This allowed for the decomposition of growth dynamics into a genotype-specific
vigour component and temperature-response component. Thereby we could assess
interdependence between vigour and temperature-response to plant height and the timing
of developmental key stages.

Linear models were used before to describe wheat growth response to temperature for leaf
elongation (Nagelmüller et al., 2016), canopy cover (Grieder et al., 2015) as well as stem
elongation rate (Slafer and Rawson, 1995a). Others proposed the use of a more complex,
Arrhenius type of function to account for decreasing growth rates at supra optimal
temperatures (Parent and Tardieu, 2012). Wheat has its temperature-optimum at around
27°C (Parent and Tardieu, 2012). As temperatures in the measured growth intervals during
stem elongation did not exceed 25°C and given the temporal resolution of the data, a simple
linear model is justified (Parent et al., 2018).

The results of the correlation analysis show a clear connection between FH and temperatureresponse (slpSER~T) as well as between FH and vigour (intSER~T). This is consistent with part i)
and ii) of our hypothesis: Final height can be described as a function of temperatureindependent growth processes and as a function of temperature-response during SE.
Importantly, among all components, the temperature-response was a major driver of final
height and also had a strong influence on the timing. Temperature-response delayed the
beginning of stem elongation leading to a later start and end of the whole phase. This finding
might appear counter intuitive: given the assumption that plants develop faster under higher
ambient temperatures a more responsive genotype should develop faster compared to a less
responsive one. Slafer and Rawson (1995b) reported an accelerated development towards
floral transition with increasing temperatures up to 19°C whereas higher temperatures slowed
development. In that respect, a more responsive genotype would experience a stronger delay
of floral transition under warm temperatures.

In terms of their correlation to FH, the effects of the timing of start and end of stem elongation
(part iii) of the initial hypothesis) are less distinct. Final height was more a function of faster
growth than duration of growth, especially since genotypes with a strong temperatureresponse have a shorter duration of SE. However, the timing of start and end of stem
elongation was linked with temperature-response. Based on this result and the according
correlations, it would appear that temperature-response influences FH directly as well as
indirectly by mediating start and end of stem elongation.

The question, whether these trait correlations are due to pleiotropic effects will substantially
impact the breeding strategy (Chen and Lübberstedt, 2010). If these effects are pleotropic,
they have a huge impact on breeding as they indicate that temperature-response, timing and
height are to a large degree determined by the same set of genes. Alternative explanations
are linkage and population structure. As the examined traits are major drivers of adaptation
to the different regions of Europe we anticipate a very strong selection for both, temperature
response as well as timing of critical stages. The GABI wheat panel is made of wheat varieties
from different regions of Europe. Even if there is no apparent population structure at neutral
markers, there may be a strong population structure at selected loci with strong effect on local

adaptation. However, pleiotropy between height and flowering time is known for maize and
rice, supporting the hypothesis of pleiotropy here. The DWARF8 gene of maize encoding a
DELLA protein is associated with height and flowering time (Lawit et al., 2010) and strongly
associated with climate adaptation (Camus-Kulandaivelu et al., 2006, page). The rice GHD7
locus has a strong effect on number of days to heading, number of grains per panicle, plant
height and stem growth (Xue et al., 2008). To further examine the relationship among the
different traits we consider the following GWAS analysis using stringent correction of
population structure.

373

The GWAS results indicate an independent genetic control of final height, temperature
response and the timing of critical stages. Whereas vigour and FH as well as start and end of
SE appear to be partly linked. Yet, final height could be predicted with surprising accuracy
using the QTL for temperature response, vigour, start and end of SE which reflects the
correlations found in the phenotypic data.

Previous studies investigating the control of developmental key stages in wheat with respect
to temperature generally adopted the concept, that after fulfilment of photoperiod and
vernalisation, EPS genes act as fine tuning factors independent of environmental stimuli
(Kamran et al., 2014; Zikhali and Griffiths, 2015). Temperature, apart from vernalisation is
thought to generally quicken growth and development independent of the cultivar (Slafer and
Rawson, 1995b; Porter and Gawith, 1999; Slafer et al., 2015). A genotype-specific temperature
effect on the duration of different phases was not considered (Takahashi &Yasuda 1971, Slafer
& Rawson 1995c). It was however reported, that photoperiod effects vary depending on
temperature (Slafer and Rawson, 1995c). Under long days, Hemming et al. (2012) reported
faster development and fewer fertile florets under high compared to low temperatures.
Temperature-dependent effects were also found for different EPS QTL (Slafer and Rawson,
1995c; Gororo et al., 2001). It has previously been suggested, that EPS effects could be
associated with interaction effects between genotype and temperature fluctuations (Slafer
and Rawson, 1995c; van Beem et al., 2005).

The mechanisms of ambient temperature sensing and its effects on growth and development
are not yet well understood (Sanchez‐Bermejo and Balasubramanian, 2016). However,
important findings regarding ambient temperature effects on flowering time as well as on
hypocotyl elongation have come from the model species Arabidopsis thaliana (Wigge, 2013).
With respect to these two traits, Sanchez‐Bermejo and Balasubramanian (2016) reported
distinct genotypic differences in temperature-sensitivity. According to their results, the
flowering pathway genes FRIGIDA (FRI), FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) and FLOWERING LOCUS T
(FT) are major candidate genes for ambient temperature mediated differences in flowering
time (Sanchez‐Bermejo and Balasubramanian, 2016). In the present study, we found FRI
homologues near two of the three QTL for temperature-response. FRI and FLC acts as main
vernalisation genes in A. thaliana (Johanson et al., 2000; Amasino and Michaels, 2010). In
wheat, these genes are not yet well described. However, FLC orthologues were found to act
as flowering repressors regulated by vernalisation in monocots (Sharma et al., 2017).

402
403

Another promising candidate gene for temperature response found near the QTL on
chromosome 1B is EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3). In A. thaliana, ELF3 was found to be a core

part of circadian clock involved in ambient temperature response (Thines and Harmon, 2010).
In Barley, ELF3 was shown to be involved in the control of temperature dependent expression
of flowering time genes (Ejaz and von Korff, 2017). A mutant ELF3 accelerated floral
development under high ambient temperatures while maintaining the number of seeds (Ejaz
and von Korff, 2017). Furthermore, ELF3 has been reported as a candidate gene for EPS1 in
Triticum monococcum (Alvarez et al., 2016).

One important aspect we could not address in the current study is the interaction of genotype
specific temperature response with vernalisation and photoperiod (Slafer and Rawson, 1995c;
Gol et al., 2017; Kiss et al., 2017). It also remains unclear if and to which extent temperature
response varies across different developmental phases and how temperature-response
relates to other environmental stimuli such as vapour pressure deficit or radiation.
Nevertheless, the results of this study present valuable information towards a better
understanding of temperature response in wheat and may be of great importance for
breeding. Temperature-response could provide a breeding avenue for local adaptation as well
as the control of plant height.

With the recent advancements in UAV-based phenotyping techniques, the growth of canopy
cover and canopy height can be measured using image segmentation and structure from
motion approaches (Bareth et al., 2016; Aasen and Bareth, 2018; Roth et al., 2018). Thus,
temperature-response can be investigated during the vegetative canopy cover development
(Grieder et al., 2015) and during the generative height development as demonstrated here. It
can also be assessed in indoor platforms (e.g. Parent and Tardieu, 2012) and the field using
leaf length tracker (Nagelmüller et al., 2016) measuring short-term responses of leaf growth
to diurnal changes in temperature. Combining this information may greatly improve our
understanding about the genetic variation in growth response to temperature.

Conclusion

Supplementary Data

Modern phenotyping platforms hold great promise to map the genetic factors driving the
response of developmental processes to environmental stimuli. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first experiment dissecting the stem elongation process into its underlying
components: temperature-dependent elongation, temperature-independent vigour and
elongation duration. The independent loci detected for these traits, suggest that it is possible
to select them independently. The detected loci may be used to fine tune height and the
beginning and end of stem elongation as they explain a substantial part of the overall
genotypic variation. With increases in automation, growth processes may be monitored in the
field on a daily basis or even multiple times per day. This will increasing the precision in
assessing genotype responses to the fluctuation in meteorological conditions and quantifying
the relationship of these responses to yield. Remote sensing by means of unmanned aerial
vehicles in combination with photogrammetric algorithms will allow to measure these traits
in breeding nurseries. We believe that this is paving the road for a more informed selection to
climate adaptation within individual growing seasons.

Fig. 1: Illustration and interpretation for the parameters of the applied temperature
response model (eq. 2). A: Distribution of Pearson correlation coefficients between intercept
and slope of the linear model for individual years, depending on the temperature, at which
the intercept is estimated. Dotted vertical lines indicate the critical temperature (T crit) for
individual years used to estimate the intercept. B-D: Illustration of the relation between
intercept and slope on contrasting genotypes (dashed and dash-dotted lines). B: same vigour
but different in temperature-response. C both have the same T-response but differ in vigour.
D Genotypes differ in vigour as well as in T-response. Horizontal and vertical dotted lines
indicate vigour and Tcrit respectively. The two contrasting genotypes per example (B-D) were
selected from the 2017 data based on their vales for slope and intercept.
