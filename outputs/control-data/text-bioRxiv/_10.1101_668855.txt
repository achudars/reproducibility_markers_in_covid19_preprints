ABSTRACT

CTCF binding contributes to the establishment of higher order genome structure by demarcating
the boundaries of large-scale topologically associating domains (TADs). We have carried out an
experimental and computational study that exploits the natural genetic variation across five closely
related species to assess how CTCF binding patterns stably fixed by evolution in each species
contribute to the establishment and evolutionary dynamics of TAD boundaries. We performed
CTCF ChIP-seq in multiple mouse species to create genome-wide binding profiles and associated
them with TAD boundaries. Our analyses reveal that CTCF binding is maintained at TAD
boundaries by an equilibrium of selective constraints and dynamic evolutionary processes.
Regardless of their conservation across species, CTCF binding sites at TAD boundaries are
subject to stronger sequence and functional constraints compared to other CTCF sites. TAD
boundaries frequently harbor rapidly evolving clusters containing both evolutionary old and young
CTCF sites as a result of repeated acquisition of new species-specific sites close to conserved
ones. The overwhelming majority of clustered CTCF sites colocalize with cohesin and are
significantly closer to gene transcription start sites than nonclustered CTCF sites, suggesting that
CTCF clusters particularly contribute to cohesin stabilization and transcriptional regulation. Overall,
CTCF site clusters are an apparently important feature of CTCF binding evolution that are critical
the functional stability of higher order chromatin structure.

The three-dimensional organization of mammalian genomes comprises distinct structural layers
that associate with important functions and range across various scales (Hansen et al., 2018a;
Merkenschlager and Nora, 2016; Ruiz-Velasco and Zaugg, 2017). At a scale of tens to hundreds
of kilobases, chromatin is partitioned into topologically associating domains (TADs), which are
defined as genomic regions with a high frequency of self-interaction, while few or no interactions
are observed between neighboring TADs (Dixon et al., 2012; Nora et al., 2012). As a consequence
of their insulating structure TADs modulate connections between regulatory elements, such as
promoters and enhancers, and thus play an essential role in transcriptional regulation (Mifsud et
al., 2015; Nora et al., 2012; Pombo and Dillon, 2015; Schoenfelder et al., 2015; Symmons et al.,
2014). TAD structures are reported to be highly conserved across species and cell types (Dixon
et al., 2012; Vietri Rudan et al., 2015).

Despite the importance and conservation of TADs, the mechanisms underlying their stability and
evolution remain elusive. A large body of evidence supports a model where the CCCTC-binding
factor (CTCF), colocalized with the cohesin protein complex, plays a causal role in the formation
and maintenance of TADs (Phillips-Cremins et al., 2013; Sofueva et al., 2013; Zuin et al., 2014).
CTCF is a ubiquitously expressed zinc-finger protein with a deeply conserved DNA-binding domain
(Filippova et al., 1996; Klenova et al., 1993; Moon et al., 2005; Ohlsson et al., 2001). It is
responsible for diverse regulatory functions including transcriptional activation and repression as
well as promoter and enhancer insulation. Its diverse functions are based on its role in promoting
interactions between distant genomic elements by mediating chromatin loop formation
(Baniahmad et al., 1990; Lobanenkov et al., 1990; Ong and Corces, 2014). A loop extrusion
mechanism of TAD formation has been proposed wherein the cohesin protein complex slides
along chromatin forming a growing loop until it meets two CTCF molecules bound with convergent
orientation. This architecture then prevents cohesin from sliding further, demarcating the TAD
boundaries (Fudenberg et al., 2016; Sanborn et al., 2015). This model explains why these
boundaries usually harbor CTCF binding sites. Nevertheless, there are ubiquitous CTCF-bound
regions with diverse functions throughout the genome, while only a small fraction of them occur at
TAD boundaries (Dixon et al., 2012). This has made it challenging to delineate the precise role of
CTCF binding in establishing and stabilizing TAD structures.

Several recent perturbational studies experimentally provide some insights into the role of CTCF
in determining local and genome-wide three-dimensional chromatin organization. Local disruption
of CTCF binding can lead to abrogation of TAD insulation and formation of ectopic cis-regulatory
interactions between neighboring TADs (Gómez-Marín et al., 2015; Guo et al., 2015; Nora et al.,
2012; Ong and Corces, 2014; Pombo and Dillon, 2015), although TAD structures have been
reported to remain intact (Barutcu et al., 2018; Nora et al., 2012; Sanborn et al., 2015). Local TAD
disruptions may also lead to disease (Flavahan et al., 2016; Ibn-Salem et al., 2014; Lupiáñez et
al., 2015, 2016). Upon acute, transient genome-wide depletion of CTCF there is marked disruption

to chromatin loop and TAD structures (Kubo et al., 2017; Nora et al., 2017), but the degree of TAD
destabilization remains controversial. The impact of this CTCF-mediated insulation on gene
expression remains poorly understood. Indeed, experimental approaches that disrupt CTCF
binding remain limited by the fundamental roles of CTCF in development and cell viability.

The binding profiles of CTCF in present-day eukaryotic genomes are shaped by repeated waves
of transposable element insertions carrying CTCF binding sequences across mammalian
genomes (Bourque et al., 2008; Schmidt et al., 2012; Schwalie et al., 2013; Thybert et al., 2018).
Mammalian-conserved sites resulted from ancestral expansions, while recent expansions have
established lineage-specific binding patterns. For example, the B2 family of short interspersed
nuclear elements (SINEs) active in the mouse-rat ancestor shaped the CTCF binding profile of all
Muridae species and specific members of the B2 family remain active in a lineage-specific manner
(Bourque et al., 2008; Schmidt et al., 2012; Thybert et al., 2018). The human and macaque
genomes also share a large fraction of CTCF-associated transposable elements despite the
absence of recent large-scale insertional activity (Schwalie et al., 2013). Moreover, representative
mammals share conserved CTCF binding sites at their TAD borders (Dixon et al., 2012; Rao et
al., 2014; Vietri Rudan et al., 2015).

The evolutionary history of CTCF binding facilitates a complementary approach to understanding
the role of CTCF in TAD stability. Specifically, we can leverage the natural genetic variation
between species as opposed to experimental approaches using targeted or systemic CTCF
binding disruption. We can thus investigate the consequences of CTCF binding changes stably
fixed by evolution as a version of an in vivo mutagenesis screen (Heinz et al., 2013). A unique and
important advantage of this approach is that the physiological cellular system can be assumed to
be in stable and homeostatic equilibrium (Gasch et al., 2016). CTCF is ideally suited to such an
evolutionary approach because in each species the CTCF binding profile is composed of
substantial numbers of both deeply conserved and evolutionarily recent sites (Schmidt et al., 2012;
Thybert et al., 2018).

Here we performed CTCF ChIP-seq in five mouse strains and species, which have similar
genomes and transcriptional profiles, to give insight into the establishment and stability of TADs.
Our analysis of the genome-wide CTCF binding exploits natural genetic variation between species
to assess the evolutionary dynamics of TAD boundary demarcation. We also investigated how
local losses of CTCF binding impact gene expression in the neighboring TADs. We revealed that
TAD borders are characterized by clusters of both evolutionarily old and young CTCF binding sites.
In addition, CTCF bound regions at TAD borders, regardless of age, exhibit increased levels of
sequence constraint compared with CTCF binding sites not associated with TAD boundaries. Such
clusters are consistent with a model of TAD boundaries in a dynamic equilibrium between selective
constraints and active evolutionary processes. As a result, they apparently retain a redundancy of
CTCF binding sites that give resilience to the three-dimensional genome structure.

RESULTS

Mus-conserved CTCF binding sites commonly occur at TAD borders

To investigate the evolution of CTCF binding with respect to the boundaries of topologically
associating domains (TADs), we experimentally identified CTCF enriched regions in the livers of
five Mus species: Mus musculus domesticus (C57BL/6), M. musculus castaneus (CAST), M.
spretus, M. caroli, and M. pahari. We characterized the conservation level of the identified CTCF
binding sites based on whether they are shared by all species (Mus-conserved or 5-way), fewer
than five species (4-way, 3-way, 2-way) or are species-specific (1-way) (Fig. 1A). The most
common categories were the Mus-conserved and species-specific CTCF binding sites (Fig. 1A,
S1). We found ~11,000 Mus-conserved CTCF binding sites, which made up more than a quarter
(~27%) of the total number of CTCF sites identified in C57BL/6J (Fig. S1). This is consistent with
previous observations of high CTCF binding conservation across eutherian mammals, especially
compared with other transcription factors such as HNF4A and CEBPA (Kunarso et al., 2010;
Schmidt et al., 2010, 2012).

We then intersected the CTCF binding profiles with TAD borders identified using Hi-C in C57BL/6J
liver (Vietri Rudan et al., 2015). We projected the CTCF sites identified in each of the five Mus
species onto the C57BL/6J genome assembly (GRCm38/mm10) (Fig. 1B). After grouping all the
CTCF sites by conservation level, we measured the distance from each CTCF site to its closest
TAD boundary. Based on this distance and the resolution of the TAD map used, we distinguished
between TAD-boundary-associated (d £ 50kb) and non-TAD-boundary-associated CTCF binding
sites (d > 50kb). We observed that, although CTCF sites of all conservation levels associate with
TAD boundaries, more highly conserved CTCF sites were, on average, located closer to TAD
boundaries (Fig. 1C). Overall, 41% of the Mus-conserved CTCF sites, as compared to 23% of
species-specific sites, were found to lie within 50kb of TAD boundaries (Fig. S2). Our finding of a
progressive evolutionary trend between TAD boundaries and CTCF binding conservation, even
among closely related species, supports previous reports that shared human-mouse (Rao et al.,
2014) and mouse-dog binding sites overlap with the boundaries of TADs (Vietri Rudan et al., 2015).

Shifting the perspective from CTCF bound regions to TAD boundaries, we found that the majority
of TAD borders overlap with highly-conserved CTCF binding sites. Nevertheless, a small fraction
of the boundaries did not harbor any Mus-conserved CTCF binding events. In particular, twelve
percent had CTCF sites conserved only in one, two or three out of the five studied Mus species
(Fig. S3). Furthermore, nearly 5% of TAD boundaries apparently do not overlap with any CTCF
occupancy (Fig. S3). One potential interpretation is that, although the connection between CTCF
binding and TAD boundaries was consistently observed, it may not strictly necessary feature for
demarcation of TAD boundaries as suggested by Hansen et al., 2018a.

25
In summary, the majority of CTCF binding sites are conserved across five mouse species.
Moreover, 41% of Mus-conserved CTCF binding sites were associated with a TAD boundary, while
the vast majority (>95%) of all TAD boundaries have at least one CTCF binding site.

CTCF binding sites at TAD boundaries are under strong evolutionary constraint
To investigate the role of TAD boundary association in shaping the characteristics of CTCF binding
sites we first assessed the relationship among CTCF conservation level, TAD boundary
association, and CTCF motif strength. Specifically, we identified CTCF motifs from our ChIP-seq
peaks and calculated their binding affinity (see Methods). CTCF is known to bind to a 33/34 base
pair region of the genome consisting of a primary sequence motif (M1) and a shorter secondary
motif (M2) (Schmidt et al., 2012). We found that overall binding affinity was significantly greater for
boundary-associated CTCF sites compared to non-boundary-associated sites (Mann-Whitney U
test, p < 2.2e-16) (Fig. 2A). We asked whether this increase in affinity is driven by the fact that
many Mus-conserved CTCF sites overlap with TAD boundaries. Although motif binding affinity
increased with the CTCF binding site conservation level, TAD-boundary-associated CTCF binding

sites consistently had greater binding affinity than non-boundary-associated sites (Mann-Whitney
U tests between TAD-boundary-associated and non-TAD-boundary-associated sites: p5-way= 3.9e11, p4-way= 5.2e-13, p3-way= 6.1e-07, p2-way= 0.06, p1-way= 0.001) (Fig. 2B). In addition, we confirmed
that, independent of conservation level, CTCF binding sites at TAD borders show higher ChIP
enrichment than non-TAD-boundary-associated CTCF sites, (Fig. 2C, 2D) consistent with the
stronger predicted affinity for CTCF. Overall, our results give new insight into the observation that
mammalian-conserved CTCF sites have higher motif affinity than species-specific sites (Schmidt
et al., 2012; Vietri Rudan et al., 2015). Importantly, for all CTCF binding sites, including speciesspecific ones, proximity to a TAD boundary was associated with an increase in binding affinity (Fig.
2B, 2D). This implies that CTCF binding motifs at TAD boundaries may be under stronger selective
constraint than the motif sequences of non-TAD-boundary-associated CTCF peaks.

(A) CTCF-bound sites at TAD boundaries contain motifs with higher binding affinity
for CTCF than non-TAD-boundary-associated sites (Mann-Whitney U test: p-value
< 2.2e-10). (B) Although the binding affinity of CTCF sites is generally proportional
to the conservation level of the site (how many species it is shared by), CTCF sites
at TAD boundaries have stronger binding affinity than non-TAD-boundaryassociated sites, independent of their conservation level (Mann-Whitney U tests
between TAD-boundary-associated and non-TAD-boundary-associated sites: p1way= 0.001, p2-way= 0.06, p3-way= 6.1e-07, p4-way= 5.2e-13, p5-way= 3.9e-11). (C) TADboundary-associated CTCF peaks display higher ChIP enrichment scores, as
calculated by MACS, than non-TAD-boundary-associated peaks (Mann-Whitney U
test: p-value < 2.2e-10). (D) TAD-boundary-associated CTCF peaks, at every
conservation level, display stronger ChIP enrichment than non-TAD-boundaryassociated peaks (Mann-Whitney U tests: p1-way < 2.2e-16, p2-way= 0.002316, p3way< 2.2e-16, p4-way< 2.2e-16, p5-way= 2.047e-12). (E) The most information-rich
bases of the primary CTCF M1 motif at TAD boundaries display higher rejected
substitution (RS) scores compared to non-TAD-boundary-associated motifs. The
bottom panel shows the position weight matrix of the CTCF M1 motif from Schmidt
et al., 2012. (F) The observation in (E) is independent of the conservation level of
the CTCF sites, as shown for subsets of sites at each conservation level.

To investigate this hypothesis, we explored evolutionary sequence constraint of the CTCF binding
motif itself. We estimated sequence constraint by measuring the rejected substitution rate (RS
score) at each position of every 19 base-long primary CTCF binding motif (M1) and compared the
score between (a) TAD-boundary-associated and (b) non-TAD-boundary-associated regions (Fig.
2E, 2F). RS score is a measure of sequence constraint and reflects the number of base
substitutions that were rejected at a specific genomic position as a result of purifying selection,
compared to the number of substitutions that would have occurred if the sequence was evolving
under neutral selection (Cooper, 2005). We found that the M1 motif in TAD-boundary-associated
sites displayed higher RS scores compared to the motifs of non-TAD-boundary-associated sites
(Fig. 2E). We further compared the mean RS score per base between the two categories for CTCF
sites at every conservation level and confirmed the generality of this observation (Fig. 2F). We
also established that this observation was not caused by an enrichment of specific motif instances
at TAD boundaries (Fig. S4).

Taken together, CTCF binding sites at TAD boundaries are subject to stronger evolutionary
constraints than the CTCF binding sites that are located further away, and that this relationship is
independent of evolutionary origin of the site.

Having observed that localization of CTCF sites at TAD boundaries affects their sequence and
functional conservation, we questioned whether CTCF binding near TAD boundaries appears to
evolve by specific mechanisms. Previous results demonstrate that the binding profile of CTCF in
eukaryotic genomes is, to a large extent, the consequence of repeat element expansion (Bourque
et al., 2008; Schmidt et al., 2012; Sundaram et al., 2014; Thybert et al., 2018). We searched for
potential differences in the transposon classes that drive CTCF binding expansion at TAD
boundaries compared to the whole genome. We grouped the CTCF sites based on whether they
locate at TAD boundaries or not, and for each group we calculated the number of CTCF peak
centers that were embedded in SINEs, long terminal repeats (LTRs), long interspersed nuclear
elements (LINEs), and DNA transposons. As expected, the greatest fraction of CTCF sites in both
categories were found to be SINE-derived (Fig. 3A) (Bourque et al., 2008). The fraction of SINEderived CTCF sites at TAD borders was slightly, but not significantly, larger than in the rest of the
genome (χ2 test without Yates correction: p = 0.01), implying that SINEs may have uniform potential
to establish a CTCF site at both TAD boundaries and other genomic regions. Similarly, CTCF sites
of LTR origin did not show significant differences between the two categories (χ2: p = 0.015). In
contrast, the relative proportion of DNA transposon-derived CTCF sites was increased at TAD
boundaries (χ2: p = 0.0003) but accounted for less than 3% of the TEs that contribute to CTCF
binding (Fig. 3A). The depletion of LINE-derived CTCF binding sites at TAD boundaries compared
to the background genome was the most striking difference (χ2: p = 3.147e-15; Fig. 3A) suggesting
that CTCF binding site formation via LINE expansion is significantly less common at TAD borders
than genome-wide.

(A) Fractions of TAD-boundary-associated versus non-TAD-boundary-associated
CTCF binding sites that are embedded in different TE classes. LINE-embedded
CTCF-sites are under-represented at TAD boundaries (χ2 test without Yates
correction: p = 3.12e-15), while DNA-transposon-embedded CTCF sites are overrepresented (χ2 test: p = 0.0003), although accounting for just 3% of the TADboundary-associated sites. SINE-derived CTCF sites (χ2 test: p = 0.01) and LTRassociated CTCF sites (χ2 test: p = 0.015) show no significant differences between
the two categories. The top bar shows the percentage of the C57BL/6J genome
sequence that corresponds to each TE class, for reference. (B) Fraction of
sequence length of TAD boundary regions (TAD boundary +/- 50kb) occupied by
each TE class, compared to random genomic regions of equal length. SINE
sequences are significantly over-represented (Mann-Whitney U test: p < 2.2e-16),
while LINEs are significantly depleted at TAD boundaries (p < 2.2e-16). DNA
transposons are slightly, but significantly, enriched at TAD borders (p= 9.72e-14),
although they account for only 1% of the sequences of the studied regions on
average. Representation of LTR sequences shows no significant difference
between TAD boundaries and random genomic regions (p= 0.005; significance
threshold: 0.001).

We further assessed the representation of SINE, LTR, LINE, and DNA transposon sequences
around TAD boundaries, independent of whether they carry CTCF binding sites. In particular, we
determined the fraction of the 100kb TAD border regions occupied by different transposon classes
and compared these with random genomic regions of similar size and distribution. SINE
sequences were significantly enriched at TAD boundaries (Mann-Whitney U test: p < 2.2e-16; Fig.
3B) (Dixon et al., 2012). The fraction of LTR-derived sequences at TAD boundaries was only
marginally higher than random genomic regions (p=0.005), and the fraction of DNA transposon
sequences was also slightly higher at TAD borders (p = 9.72e-14; Fig. 3B). In contrast, LINE
sequences were significantly under-represented at TAD boundaries, compared to random
genomic regions (Mann-Whitney U test: p < 2.2e-16; Fig. 3B), suggesting that TAD boundaries
are depleted of LINEs, which may explain why LINE-derived CTCF sites appear under-represented
at TAD boundaries (Fig. 3A). Considering the characteristic length of LINE elements, this
observation potentially indicates that the insertion of long sequences such as LINEs is negatively
selected at TAD borders. This result is complementary to recent reports of selection against long
sequence deletions at the functional regions of TAD boundaries (Fudenberg and Pollard, 2019).
Moreover, it extends our previous observations and reinforces the hypothesis that in addition to
TAD-boundary-associated CTCF sites being subjected to stronger sequence and functional
constrains, TAD boundary regions as a whole are under stronger evolutionary pressure
(Fudenberg and Pollard, 2019).

TAD borders harbor clusters of conserved and nonconserved CTCF binding sites

To gain further insight into the architecture of TAD boundaries we investigated the organization of
CTCF binding sites within them. In particular, we examined how the density of CTCF binding sites
is related to distance from the TAD boundary. By grouping the CTCF binding sites based on
conservation level we observed that, as expected, TAD borders were highly enriched for
conserved CTCF binding events (Fig. 4A). However, species-specific CTCF binding sites were,
surprisingly, also enriched at TAD boundaries (Fig. 4A). Thus, TAD boundaries harbor both
numerous conserved CTCF binding sites and a high concentration of species-specific CTCF sites.
Additionally, TAD-boundary-associated sites were consistently close to a neighboring site (median
distance » 5.3kb-5.9kb) regardless of their conservation level (Fig. 4B). In contrast, CTCF binding
sites not associated with a TAD boundary were further apart from each other (Mann-Whitney U
test: p < 2.2e-16) and the median distance to their closest neighboring site was dependent on
conservation level: 7kb for 5-way conserved sites to 10.5kb for species-specific sites (Fig. 4B).

according to the maximum conservation level of CTCF binding they contain. Each
violin plot shows the distribution of the total number of CTCF sites that occur at the
TAD boundaries in the category. TAD boundaries with at least one Mus-conserved
site (right-most violin plot) also have a higher number of CTCF sites overall (higher
redundancy). In contrast, TAD boundaries that do not contain any speciesconserved CTCF sites (left-most violin plot) have much lower numbers of CTCF
binding sites. There is a progressive association between presence of individual
conserved CTCF sites with higher abundance of CTCF sites. (E) The bars

conservation level of CTCF binding they contain. Dark green demarcates TAD
boundaries with clustered CTCF sites; light green shows TAD boundaries with only
singleton sites. TAD boundaries that harbor species-conserved CTCF sites also
contain CTCF site clusters. (F) Schematic representation of evolutionarily dynamic
clusters of CTCF sites that commonly occur at TAD boundaries. TAD borders
usually have at least one 5-way conserved CTCF site that is clustered with other
sites of lower conservation, including species-specific ones. These CTCF clusters
preserve CTCF binding potential at TAD boundaries.
We asked whether TAD borders have a specific structure of CTCF sites by investigating potential
ancestral clusters from the full set of CTCF binding sites projected to the C57BL/6J genome (n =
56,625; Fig. 1B). We defined a CTCF cluster as a group of at least two CTCF binding sites that
are each less than 10kb apart on the genome. After clustering we found that 23,232 (43%) sites
were singletons whereas 32,393 (57%) were part of 11,507 clusters. Interestingly, we observed
that the CTCF sites belonging to a cluster were significantly enriched at TAD borders than singleton
CTCF sites (Fig. 4C). This finding strongly implies that clusters of CTCF binding sites are a
fundamental architectural structure of TAD boundaries.

To further characterize the CTCF binding clusters at TAD borders, we asked how features such
as redundancy, clustering, and presence of both conserved and nonconserved binding events
lying in close proximity are associated with each other. We found that TAD borders with at least
one 5-way conserved CTCF site contained both a higher number of CTCF sites overall (Fig. 4D)
that mainly belong to clusters (Fig. 4E). This shows that Mus-conserved CTCF sites at TAD
boundaries usually form clusters with other, more recently evolved CTCF sites (Fig. 4F).

We questioned whether this phenomenon is solely a characteristic of TAD boundaries or is it also
found in other part parts of the genome. We identified 5-way conserved CTCF sites that were not
associated with TAD boundaries (selected as d > 80kb from the TAD border to ensure the entire
cluster would be d > 50kb) and inspected the CTCF binding profile around them. We observed that
additional CTCF sites of various conservation levels, including high numbers of species-specific
CTCF sites, were generally accumulated around these Mus-conserved sites (Fig. S5). Overall,
Mus-conserved CTCF binding events are usually part of CTCF binding clusters, rather than

appearing as singleton sites. Moreover, although the clusters are apparently stably anchored at 5way CTCF sites, the cluster as a whole seems to be evolving dynamically, allowing for integration
of many evolutionarily younger lineage-specific sites.

Finally, we investigated whether the evolutionary characteristics of clustered CTCF binding across
the five species were recapitulated when looking at a single species. We confirmed the enrichment
of C57BL/6J CTCF sites of any conservation level at TAD boundaries (Fig. S6A) and that clustered
CTCF sites in C57BL/6J were also more highly enriched at TAD boundaries than singleton CTCF
sites (Fig. S6B), as observed in all Mus species (Fig. 4A, 4C). Moreover, we found that half of
C57BL/6J CTCF binding sites were clustered, similar to the full set of Mus CTCF binding regions
(Fig. S6C). We also found that the conservation of whole clusters of CTCF sites in C57BL/6J was
similar to that of individual CTCF binding sites (Fig. S6D). This implies that clusters of CTCF sites
are evolving under selective pressure similar to that underlying the conservation of individual CTCF
binding sites.

15
In summary, clusters of CTCF binding sites of all conservation levels are a common characteristic
of TAD boundaries maintained by dynamic evolutionary processes with species-specific sites
playing a prominent role. In addition, CTCF clusters with similar characteristics can also be found
distant to TAD borders suggesting a broader role in genome function.

Clusters of CTCF binding sites colocalize with cohesin and regulate gene expression

25

30

To gain further insight into possible additional functional roles of CTCF binding site clusters, we
performed ChIP-seq for the cohesin subunit RAD21 in C57BL/6J. CTCF is known to interact with
cohesin to form chromatin loops (Ong and Corces, 2014; Parelho et al., 2008; Rubio et al., 2008;
Stedman et al., 2008; Wendt et al., 2008; Xiao et al., 2011). To control for the longer genomic
regions spanned by CTCF clusters we extended the genomic intervals around the singleton CTCF
sites such that the mean of their length distribution was equal to that of the CTCF site clusters (Fig.
S7). We found that CTCF site clusters were significantly more likely to overlap with regions
enriched for RAD21; 93% compared with only 69% for singleton CTCF sites (χ2 test, p <2.2e-16)
(Fig. 5A). This suggests that clusters of closely located CTCF binding sites help stabilize cohesin
and may represent anchors of chromatin loops or TAD boundaries.

(A) 93.7% of the clusters of CTCF binding sites colocalize with the cohesin subunit
RAD21, while the respective fraction of extended singleton CTCF sites is 69% (χ2
test: p < 2.2e-16). The singleton CTCF binding regions were extended by a few
kilobases prior to intersection with RAD21 binding regions to ensure the mean of
their length distribution is equal to the mean length distribution of clusters of CTCF
sites. (B) CTCF sites that belong to clusters (clustered) are located closer to gene
TSSs (Median distance = 5.3kb) than singleton CTCF sites (Median distance =
10.9kb) (Mann-Whitney U test: p < 2.2e-16).

CTCF is also known to bind near gene promoters (Chen et al., 2012). We measured the distance
of each CTCF site belonging to a cluster to the nearest transcription start site (TSS) and compared
this distribution to the corresponding distances for singleton CTCF sites. We found that CTCF sites
belonging to a cluster are generally located significantly closer to TSSs (Median distance = 5.3kb)
than singleton CTCF sites (Median distance = 10.9kb) (Mann-Whitney U test, p < 2.2e -16; Fig.
5B) which suggests that clusters of CTCF sites may also play an integral role in regulating gene
expression.

CTCF binding sites at TAD boundaries are thought to enhance contact insulation between
regulatory elements of adjacent TADs (Schoenfelder et al., 2015) and therefore their disruption
can lead to local ectopic interactions between promoters and enhancers (Flavahan et al., 2016;
Guo et al., 2015; Nora et al., 2012). However, the impact of such disruptions on local gene
expression has not been systematically investigated. Here, we took advantage of natural genetic
variation in closely related mouse species and our own CTCF binding data to study the effect of
CTCF binding site loss in a model fixed by evolution. This approach offers significant advantages
over many other experimental approaches, such as disruption of specific CTCF sites (Barutcu et
al., 2018; Guo et al., 2015; Lupiáñez et al., 2015; Nora et al., 2012), haploinsufficiency models
(Kemp et al., 2014), or transient acute depletion systems (Kubo et al., 2017; Nora et al., 2017) in
which there is global disruption of cellular equilibrium.

We investigated the instances at TAD boundaries where a CTCF binding event was conserved in
all but one of the five study species. We estimated the impact of these changes on the expression
of proximal genes using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in C57BL/6J, CAST, and M. caroli. First, we
identified either CAST-specific (Fig. 6A) or M. caroli-specific losses of individual CTCF binding
events at TAD boundaries (Fig. 6D). For each of these lost CTCF sites, we found the closest
upstream and the closest downstream one-to-one orthologous gene in all three species (Fig. 6A,
6D) and calculated the relative gene expression of this gene pair (expressed as log2 fold-change)
in each of the species (see Methods). We then compared these relative expression patterns
among the three species.

We found no impact on insulating function due to species-specific losses of individual CTCF
binding events at TAD borders (Fig. 6B, 6C, 6E, 6F, 6H, 6I). This suggests that expression patterns
of genes at the borders of TADs are robust to the losses of individual CTCF binding even in cases
where the binding event is preserved in multiple other closely related species. We propose that
the observed CTCF clusters, which may function interchangeably or additively, contribute to the
maintenance of this functional resilience.

DISCUSSION

20

We used the natural genetic variation of five closely related species to investigate and characterize
features of CTCF binding at TAD boundaries. Our analyses reveal that CTCF binding sites at the
boundaries of TADs are generally subject to stronger sequence constraints compared to CTCF
sites in the background genome. Nevertheless, the CTCF binding profile at TAD borders seems
to also be evolving under the effect of dynamic evolutionary processes. This is indicated by
numerous gains of new species-specific CTCF binding sites close to species-conserved ones,
giving rise to mixed clusters containing both evolutionary old and young CTCF binding sites.

25

Our data show that CTCF binding is largely conserved across Mus species, consistent with prior
studies that demonstrate conservation across mammals (Kunarso et al., 2010; Schmidt et al.,
2010, 2012). Our data also indicate that the boundaries of TADs commonly overlap with Musconserved CTCF sites, similar to observations from more distantly related mammalian lineages
(Rao et al., 2014; Vietri Rudan et al., 2015). We show that a significant fraction of species-specific
CTCF sites also localize in the vicinity of TAD borders, and that CTCF binding sites at TAD
boundaries have both stronger sequence constraints and stronger binding affinity, independent of
their conservation across species. Our data also reveal discrepancies in the expansion of TE
classes at TAD boundary regions compared to the background genome. Specifically, TAD
boundaries are relatively depleted of both LINE elements and LINE-derived CTCF binding sites,
suggesting negative selection against insertions of long—and potentially disrupting—sequences
at TAD boundaries. This is complementary to observed structural variant depletion at TAD
boundaries as an effect of purifying selection (Fudenberg and Pollard, 2019). Overall, these
observations suggest that the functional role of CTCF binding at TAD boundary regions is

maintained by multiple evolutionary mechanisms including local sequence constraint, new site
acquisition, and rejection of insertions and deletions.

Our results show that dynamically conserved regions that contain clusters of CTCF sites are
another common characteristic of TAD boundaries. These clusters comprise both conserved
CTCF binding events, which were apparently fixed at TAD boundary regions in the common
ancestor, and divergent sites, which are the result of more recent gains or losses within the distinct
mouse lineages. These clusters suggest a mechanism by which local turnover events can largely
preserve TAD structure and function. Indeed, a recent study has demonstrated CTCF binding site
turnover at loop anchors mediated by TEs, and it suggested that this is a common mechanism of
contributing to conserved genome folding events between human and mouse (Choudhary et al.,
2018). Based on these observations, we conclude that the formation of CTCF binding site clusters
serves as an additional evolutionary buffering mechanism to preserve the CTCF binding potential
of TAD boundaries and ensure resilience of higher order chromatin structure by maintaining a
dynamic redundancy of CTCF binding sites.

Evolutionarily conserved clusters of CTCF binding sites may help explain previous observations
of TAD structures remaining intact upon experimental disruption of individual or multiple CTCF
sites, assuming that such clustered CTCF binding sites can be used interchangeably to provide
higher order resilience against local disruptions. For example, Nora et al. showed that the deletion
of a TAD boundary is followed by ectopic cis-interactions locally but adjacent TADs do not merge;
they hypothesize that there must be additional elements within TADs that “act as relays when a
main boundary is removed” (Nora et al., 2012). Furthermore, Barutcu et al. demonstrated that TAD
structures are preserved upon deletion of the CTCF-rich Firre locus from a TAD boundary (Barutcu
et al., 2018). They hypothesize that additional CTCF binding sites outside the Firre locus may
serve to recruit CTCF and thus help maintain the TAD boundary. In addition, a recent study on
CTCF hemizygosity suggested that, within genes, adjacent CTCF sites may have subtle additive
effects on gene expression (Aitken et al., 2018), suggesting that clustered CTCF sites may
enhance other CTCF functions. We also found that gene expression around TAD boundaries in
cases of species-specific losses of individual CTCF sites is highly robust. As a whole, our results
strongly suggest that the dynamic conservation of genomic regions harboring clusters of CTCF
sites is an important feature of CTCF binding evolution, which is critical to the functional stability
of higher order chromatin structure. Interestingly, such clusters are also found in genomic regions
other than TAD borders. It is possible that these regions are related to the establishment of higher
order chromatin structure, potentially representing unidentified TAD boundaries or loop anchors,
or other functional and regulatory roles of CTCF.

Further insight into the functional implications of CTCF site clusters come from our result that CTCF
clusters colocalize with the cohesin subunit RAD21 to a greater frequency than singleton CTCF
sites. Moreover, we demonstrate that clustered CTCF sites are located significantly closer to TSSs
than singleton sites. Together, these suggest that clusters play an important role in stabilizing

cohesin at specific genomic regions, as well as in transcriptional regulation. These observations
may provide new mechanistic insight to the previously proposed dynamic loop maintenance
complex (LMC) model, in which cohesin associates with a genomic region for a significantly longer
time than CTCF molecules (Hansen et al., 2017). Specifically, our observations of clustered CTCF
binding sites support the proposed rapid unloading and rebinding of CTCF molecules in close
genomic proximity, which facilitates rapid cohesin translocation on DNA between CTCF binding
sites that act as occasionally permeable boundary elements (Davidson et al., 2016; Hansen et al.,
2017). This process apparently facilitates gene transcription by allowing RNA polymerase II to
push cohesin along gene bodies (Borrie et al., 2017; Davidson et al., 2016; Heinz et al., 2018).

10

15

Finally, it is tempting to speculate a connection between our identified clusters of closely located
CTCF binding sites on the genome and the reportedly observed 3D “clusters” (or “hubs”) of CTCF
protein molecules (Hansen et al., 2018b, 2018c). In particular, Hansen et al. have proposed a
guided mechanism where an RNA strand can bind to and gather together multiple CTCF protein
molecules near cognate binding sites. These CTCF molecule hubs apparently enhance the search
for target binding sites, increase the binding rate of CTCF to its related sites (also as part of the
LMC model) and are often implicated in chromatin loop formation (Hansen et al., 2018b, 2018c).
It is possible that our identified CTCF site clusters act synergistically with this mechanism as
nearby sites for the concentrated CTCF molecules to bind.

20

25

In conclusion, we identified dynamic evolutionary clusters of CTCF binding sites as a feature of
TAD boundary architecture and we propose that these likely contribute to the remarkable resilience
of TAD structures and gene expression to losses and gains of individual CTCF binding sites. Thus,
further studies of seeking a definitive understanding of the functional roles of CTCF might require
consideration of extended regions that harbor clusters of multiple CTCF sites.

METHODS

ChIP-seq experiments and data analysis
To characterize the CTCF binding profile in Mus musculus castaneus (CAST/EiJ) and M. spretus
(SPRET/EiJ), we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments followed by highthroughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) using adult liver tissue. ChIP-seq libraries and input control
libraries from three biological replicates of each species were prepared as described in Schmidt et
al., 2009. Subsequently, libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq2000 (Illumina) to produce 100bp
paired-end sequence fragments.

10
In addition, we obtained published CTCF ChIP-seq data from the livers of Mus musculus
domesticus (C57BL/6J), Mus caroli/EiJ, and M. pahari/EiJ (Thybert et al., 2018). Three biological
replicates from each species were used.

We aligned sequenced reads from CAST and M. spretus to the reference genome assemblies
CAST_EiJ_v1 and SPRET_EiJ_v1 (Lilue et al., 2018), respectively, with BWA mem version 0.7.12
(Li and Durbin, 2010) discarding reads with more than three occurrences . We also mapped the
retrieved raw ChIP-seq reads from C57BL/6J, M. caroli and M. pahari to the genomes GRCm38
(mm10), CAROLI_EIJ_v1.1, and PAHARI_EIJ_v1.1 (Cunningham et al., 2019; Lilue et al., 2018),
respectively, using the same method for the sake of performing matched analyses in all species.
CTCF enrichment peaks were called with MACS 1.4.2 (Zhang et al., 2008) with a p-value threshold
of 0.001. For downstream analyses, we used peaks identified in at least two replicates of each
species.
We also performed ChIP-seq in C57BL/6J liver to identify genomic regions enriched for the cohesin
subunit RAD21, using also an input control library from C57BL/6J liver from Thybert et al., 2018.
Sample preparation and chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed as described in Schmidt
et al., 2012 using 10μg RAD21 antibody (Abcam, ab992, lot GR12688-8). Immunoprecipitated
DNA and 50ng of input DNA was used for library preparation using the ThruPLEX DNA-Seq library
preparation protocol (Rubicon Genomics, UK). Library fragment size was determined using a 2100
Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Libraries were quantified by qPCR (Kapa Biosystems). Pooled libraries were
deeply sequenced on a HiSeq2500 (Illumina) according to manufacturer’s instructions to produce
single-end 50bp reads. We obtained sequenced reads and mapped them to the mouse genome
assembly GRCm38 using BWA 0.6.1 (Li and Durbin, 2010). We then called RAD21 peaks using
MACS2 2.1.2.1 with default options (Zhang et al., 2008).
TADs
We used the boundaries of mouse liver TADs published by Vietri Rudan et al., 2015. We
considered as TAD boundaries the start and end nucleotides of each TAD, while in some of the
analyses (where indicated in the following methods description) we used a window of +/- 50kb
around them to study TAD boundary regions.

Conservation of CTCF binding sites in Mus species
To investigate the conservation of CTCF binding across the studied Mus species, we first found
the orthologous alignments of the CTCF ChIP-seq peaks in the genomes of the other species.
These orthologous CTCF regions across mice were obtained using an extended version of the
eutherian mammal Endo-Pecan-Ortheus (EPO) multiple genome alignment that also included the
genomes of CAST, M. spretus, M.caroli, and M. pahari (Thybert et al., 2018). Once the orthologous
regions of CTCF sites were identified in all Mus species, we cross-validated the binding of CTCF
in each species using the corresponding ChIP-seq data. Specifically, we considered that a CTCF
site was conserved if it (a) it had an orthologous alignment across species and (b) the orthologous
alignments also contained a CTCF ChIP-seq peak (Fig. 1B).
Binding affinity and sequence constraint of CTCF motifs
To identify CTCF binding motifs, we retrieved the FASTA sequences of all CTCF peaks in
C57BL/6J, using bedtools getfasta v.2.25.0 (Quinlan and Hall, 2010) and scanned these
sequences for the primary CTCF binding motif (M1) from the JASPAR database (Mathelier et al.,
2014) using Find Individual Motif Occurrences (FIMO) from the MEME suite v.4.12.0 (Bailey et al.,
2009; Grant et al., 2011) with default parameters. We extended the identified 19 base-long M1
motifs to include 20 bases upstream and 20 bases downstream in order to allow discovery of the
extended version of the motifs (M1 and M2). Finally, we calculated the binding affinity of these
sequences for CTCF using DeepBind v.0.11 (Alipanahi et al., 2015), as in Aitken et al., 2018, and
compared the significance of the difference between distributions of the affinity values between
motifs found in TAD-boundary-associated and non-TAD-boundary-associated CTCF peaks at
each conservation level (Fig. 2A-B).
To retrieve Rejected Substitution (RS) scores for each position of every identified 19 base-long
M1 motif in C57BL/6J, we obtained pre-calculated GERP (Cooper, 2005) conservation scores for
each nucleotide of these mouse M1 sequences from Ensembl (Herrero et al., 2016). The RS score
of a genomic position was calculated as the difference of observed to expected substitutions. We
then averaged the RS score per position among all motifs and compared these averaged RS
scores of TAD-boundary-associated M1 motifs with non-TAD-boundary-associated motifs (Fig. 2E,
2F).
ChIP-seq enrichment of identified CTCF peaks
The CTCF sites that we identified in each species were the intersection of the CTCF peaks called
in ³ 2 biological replicates. We calculated the ChIP-seq fragment enrichment of each CTCF site
by averaging the ChIP enrichment scores, reported by MACS, over the replicates. We then
compared the significance of the difference between the distributions of average ChIP enrichment
between TAD-boundary-associated and non-TAD-boundary-associated CTCF sites of each
conservation level using Mann-Whitney U tests (Fig. 2C, 2D).

Motif word usage analysis
We scanned all CTCF peaks from each of the five species for the primary CTCF binding motif (M1)
using FIMO from the MEME suite as described above. From the 19-base M1 motif instances

identified in each species we retrieved the central most informative 14-mer and estimated its
frequency of occurrence as: the number of occurrences of the 14-mer word in CTCF binding
regions divided by the number of occurrences of the word in the whole genome of the species
using the procedure of Schmidt et al., 2012. We filtered out any motif word that occurred fewer
than five times in the whole genome. We illustrated the occurrence frequency of the motif words
in each species on a heatmap which is sorted by distance to the closest TAD border (Fig. S4).
Association of CTCF binding sites with classes of transposable elements
We used the full set of CTCF sites identified in all species and projected them on to the C57BL/6J
genome (GRCm38), as well as published transposable elements in C57BL/6J (Thybert et al., 2018;
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/research/flicek/publications/FOG21). We intersected the center of each
CTCF binding site with the transposable elements and reported the number of CTCF site centers
that overlapped with each TE class. The overall representation of each TE class in the whole
genome that is shown as a reference (marked as “background” in Fig. 3A) was calculated as: the
total length of all TEs belonging to each class (SINE, LINE, LTR, DNA) sequences divided by the
total genome length.
Representation of TE classes at TAD boundary regions
As for Fig. 3B, we defined TAD boundary regions as genomic windows of 50kb upstream and 50kb
downstream of the boundaries of TADs. To evaluate the representation of each TE class, we
summed the length of sequences corresponding to each TE class that occurred within each TAD
boundary region and divided that by the total length of the TAD boundary region, i.e.100kb. To
retrieve random genomic regions of similar length and distribution, we shuffled the TAD boundary
regions using bedtools shuffle v2.2.5.0, having first excluded chromosome Y, genome scaffolds,
and chromosome ends, where TADs are not called. We repeated the same calculation for TE class
representation as above for these shuffled TAD boundaries, i.e. random genomic regions. We then
plotted the distribution of these values for TAD boundary regions and random genomic regions.
To determine the representation of each TE class in the background genome (dotted line in Fig.
3B), we divided again the total length of all sequences that correspond to each TE class by the
total C57BL/6J genome (GRCm38) length, analogous to the CTCF TE class analysis above.
Density of CTCF sites at TAD boundaries and clusters of CTCF binding sites
To determine the enrichment of CTCF binding sites in TAD boundary regions (compared to the
surrounding genome) we measured the distance of each CTCF binding site to its closest TAD
boundary using bedtools closest. We then categorized the CTCF sites based on their conservation
level. For each CTCF site conservation level, we grouped all distance values up to +/- 300kb in
bins of 20kb and plotted the number of CTCF sites in each bin divided by the length of the bin, i.e.
20kb (Fig. 4A). To further characterize the density of CTCF sites at TAD boundaries, we grouped
CTCF sites both according to their conservation level and association with a TAD boundary (vs.
no association with any TAD boundary), and for each of these categories we found the distance
of each CTCF site from its closest CTCF site using bedtools closest (Fig. 4B).

To identify clusters of CTCF binding sites, we used the full set of CTCF binding sites of all five Mus
species projected onto the C57BL/6J genome (GRCm38/mm10), as shown in Fig. 1B. We
identified instances of consecutive CTCF sites that were up to 10kb apart from each other, using
bedtools cluster. We then determined and compared the enrichment of clustered and singleton
CTCF sites at TAD boundaries using the same approach as in Fig. 4A but having categorized the
CTCF sites based on whether they belong to a cluster (clustered) or not (singletons) (Fig. 4C).
For Figures 4D and 4E, we again defined TAD boundary regions as TAD boundary +/- 50kb. We
categorized these regions based on the highest conservation level of their CTCF sites.
Subsequently, for each category we counted its total number of CTCF sites (Fig. 4D), as well as
the number of these TAD boundary regions with clustered CTCF sites and with only singleton sites
(Fig. 4E).
For Fig. S5, we defined Mus-conserved (5-way) CTCF sites with a distance to the closest TAD
border >80kb as non-TAD-boundary associated. We calculated the enrichment of 1-way (speciesspecific), 2-way, 3-way, and 4-way conserved CTCF sites in their vicinity in the same way as in for
TAD boundaries (Fig. 4A), but using as anchor the non-TAD-boundary-associated 5-way CTCF
sites themselves, instead of the TAD boundaries.
Clusters in C57BL/6J and cluster conservation analyses
We identified clusters of CTCF binding sites in C57BL/6J (Fig. S6) in the same way as for Fig. 4C
but using only CTCF peaks called in C57BL/6J. We used the same methods as for Fig. 4A and 4C
to determine the enrichment of CTCF sites of different conservation levels at TAD borders (Fig.
S6A), as well as the enrichment of clustered versus singleton CTCF sites (Fig. S6B).

To estimate the conservation of CTCF sites clusters (Fig. S6D), we identified all the genomic
regions that correspond to clusters of CTCF sites in each of the five species separately. We then
projected through whole-genome alignments (see “Conservation of CTCF binding sites in Mus
species” Methods section) the cluster regions of each species onto the C57BL/6J genome and
determined whether they overlap with the orthologous cluster regions of the other species.
RNA-seq data
We retrieved published liver-derived RNA-seq data from six biological replicates for each of the
species C57BL/6J and M. m. castaneus (Goncalves et al., 2012), as well as from four biological
replicates of M. caroli (Wong et al., 2015). To have the same number of replicates in each spcies,
we further generated and sequenced two additional RNA-seq libraries for M. caroli following the
methods described in Goncalves et al., 2012 and Wong et al., 2015. Briefly, total RNA was
extracted from two independent liver samples using Qiazol (Qiagen) and DNase treated with DNAfree DNA Removal Kit (Ambion). Polyadenylated mRNA was enriched, directional double-stranded
cDNA was generated, fragmented by sonication, and prepared for sequencing. Each of the two
libraries were sequenced on an Illumina GAIIx to generate 75bp paired-end fragments.

Adapter sequences were trimmed off with reaper from the Kraken tool suite (Davis et al., 2013).
The paired-end RNA-seq reads from each replicate of C57BL/6J, CAST, and M. caroli were
mapped to the corresponding species genomes (see “ChIP-seq experiments and data analysis”
Methods section) using STAR 1.5.2 (Dobin et al., 2013) with default settings. Raw reads mapping
to annotated genes were counted using htseq-count (Anders et al., 2015). We then used the raw
read counts to perform differential expression analyses with DESeq2 1.20.0 (Love et al., 2014)
with default settings.
To determine gene expression patterns around instances of 5-way conserved CTCF sites and
species-specific CTCF site losses at TAD boundaries (Fig. 6A, 6D and 6G), we first identified the
closest upstream and downstream gene in each species using the gene annotation from Ensembl
version 95 (Cunningham et al., 2019) and then calculated the relative gene expression of
downstream to upstream gene in each species. We were not interested in the relative expression
of the gene pair flanking a CTCF site per se, but in whether this ratio for each CTCF site is
consistent between species when the in-between CTCF binding separating them changes. For this
reason, we only used CTCF sites that were flanked by 1:1 orthologous genes between the three
species. We went on to use DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) in order to compute the log2(fold change)
between the downstream and upstream gene – as a measure of the relative expression of genes
flanking each CTCF site – in each species, and to subsequently compare this log2(fold change)
between species. Since DESeq2 is not designed to normalize for gene lengths, and our aim was
to generate comparable expression pattern estimations between the species, we also required all
the orthologous genes that we used to have a similar length among the three species (0.7 <
len_ratio < 1.3, where len_ratio is the length of gene in species A divided by the length of its
orthologous gene in species B). Finally, we compared the calculated log2(fold-change) values for
each gene pair in C57BL/6J with the corresponding value of its orthologous gene pair in CAST
(Fig. 6B, 6E, 6H) and in M. caroli (Fig. 6C, 6F, 6I).

Figure S3: Fractions of TAD boundaries with CTCF sites of different conservation levels.
Most TAD boundaries (64%) harbor at least one Mus-conserved (5-way) CTCF site. Lower
percentages of TAD borders do not contain any Mus-conserved CTCF site but overlap with less
conserved sites or do not bind CTCF at all.

Figure S4: There is no evidence of any enrichment of specific motif words at TAD
boundaries among the species. Heatmap of the ~1,500 motif words found in CTCF peaks in the
five Mus species. Each row corresponds to a motif word, while the color density represents its frequency
of occurrence. The occurrence frequency of each motif word in the CTCF peaks is normalized by the
number of its occurrences in the whole genome for the respective species. Motif words in the heatmap
are sorted based on their distance to the closest TAD boundary. There is no evidence of any selected
set of motif words being used with significant frequency at TAD boundaries among the species. The
lower density of motif words is M. spretus reflects the smaller number of CTCF binding sites identified
in that species.

Figure S5: Clusters of both conserved and species-specific CTCF sites might also occur
away from TAD boundaries. Enrichment of CTCF sites of different conservation levels around
Mus-conserved CTCF sites that are not associated with TAD boundaries (distance from closest
TAD border: d > 80kb). A high number of species-specific (1-way) CTCF sites are concentrated
around these “anchor” 5-way conserved sites, showing that sites of mixed conservation levels can
be clustered together.

Figure S6: Inspection of the CTCF binding profile in C57BL/6J confirms that CTCF sites
form clusters in individual species. (A) Enrichment of C57BL/6J CTCF sites of different
conservation levels at TAD boundaries. (B) Clustered C57BL/6J CTCF sites are more highly
enriched than singleton sites at TAD borders. (C) The fraction of clustered CTCF sites in C57BL/6J
is similar to that of CTCF sites belonging to ancestral Mus clusters. (D) The conservation pattern
of CTCF site clusters, as distinct functional entities, resembles that of individual CTCF binding
sites.

Figure S7: Length distribution of genomic intervals occupied by singleton CTCF sites,
“extended” singleton CTCF sites and clusters of CTCF sites. The extended singleton CTCF
sites represent genomic windows of singleton CTCF sites that were extended so that the mean of
their length distribution becomes equal to that of the length distribution for the CTCF clusters.
