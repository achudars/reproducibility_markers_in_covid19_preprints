Abstract:

2

Enhancing the efficacy of proteasome inhibitors is a central goal in myeloma

3

therapy. We proposed that signaling-level responses after PI would reveal new

4

mechanisms of action that could be therapeutically exploited. Unbiased

5

phosphoproteomics after the PI carfilzomib surprisingly demonstrated the most

6

prominent phosphorylation changes on splicing related proteins. Spliceosome

7

modulation was invisible to RNA or protein abundance alone. Transcriptome

8

analysis after PI demonstrated broad-scale intron retention, suggestive of

9

spliceosome interference, as well as specific alternative splicing of protein

10

homeostasis machinery components. These findings led us to evaluate direct

11

spliceosome inhibition in myeloma, which synergized with carfilzomib and

12

showed potent anti-tumor activity. Functional genomics and exome sequencing

13

further supported the spliceosome as a specific vulnerability in myeloma. Our

14

results propose splicing interference as an unrecognized modality of PI

15

mechanism, reveal additional modes of spliceosome modulation, and suggest

16

spliceosome targeting as a promising therapeutic strategy in myeloma.

17
18

Significance:

19

New ways to enhance PI efficacy are of major interest. We combine systems-

20

level analyses to discover that PIs specifically interfere with splicing and that

21

myeloma is selectively vulnerable to spliceosome inhibition. We reveal a new

22

approach to advance myeloma therapy and uncover broader roles of splicing

23

modulation in cancer.

INTRODUCTION

2

Multiple myeloma is a clonal malignancy of plasma cells with no known

3

cure. Like normal plasma cells, myeloma cells produce and secrete incredible

4

amounts of immunoglobulin. This unique function may be exploited by

5

therapeutically inhibiting the proteasome using the FDA-approved proteasome

6

inhibitors (PIs) bortezomib, carfilzomib, and ixazomib. Proteotoxic stress caused

7

by these first-line therapeutic agents has been proposed to induce the apoptotic

8

function of the unfolded protein response (UPR) (1), leading to plasma cell death

9

while largely sparing normal tissues (2, 3). However, despite the appealing

10

simplicity of this mechanism, the canonical UPR is not always strongly induced in

11

myeloma cells by PIs (4) and is unlikely to be the sole mode of PI cytotoxicity in

12

MM. Indeed, many additional mechanisms of action of PIs have also been

13

proposed, ranging from NF-kB inhibition to immune microenvironment effects to

14

aberrant recycling of cytosolic amino acids (5, 6).

15

Identifying the full range of PI mechanisms of action remains relevant

16

given that acquired PI resistance is clinically widespread but its origins remain

17

unclear (7, 8) and finding new methods to specifically target PI-resistant disease,

18

or molecules to synergize with PIs to avoid resistance by driving deeper

19

remissions, remains a long-standing goal. As one approach to achieving this

20

goal, we and others have studied the response of malignant plasma cells to PIs

21

using both gene expression and proteomic methods (9-11). Notably, one of the

22

most prominent features of the cellular response to PIs is the activation of the

23

heat shock response (12). This mechanism leads to significant induction of

24

cytosolic protein-folding chaperones, possibly to assist in protein refolding and

25

decrease in unfolded protein stress. We and others (9, 12, 13) have therefore

26

proposed targeting mediators of the heat shock response as potential

27

combination therapies with PIs.

28

However, one unresolved question is whether proteasome inhibition may

29

carry additional effects on plasma cells that are not revealed by mRNA or protein

30

abundance analysis alone. We hypothesized that additional modalities of

31

response, and thereby new myeloma-relevant therapeutic targets, may be

revealed by studying the signaling-level response to PIs with unbiased mass

2

spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics. The large majority of therapy-relevant

3

investigations using this technique have focused on elucidating the effects of

4

kinase inhibitors (14). However, we reasoned that a significant cellular

5

perturbation such as proteasome inhibition would likely also indirectly perturb

6

kinase and phosphatase signaling in a broad fashion.

7

Here, we used unbiased phosphoproteomics to quantify >5000

8

phosphopeptides in myeloma cells exposed to the irreversible PI, carfilzomib

9

(Cfz). Surprisingly, we found the greatest increases in phosphorylation occurred

10

in proteins associated with the spliceosome machinery. A link between these

11

processes was invisible at the gene expression level. We further evaluated this

12

link from a mechanistic and therapeutic perspective, finding that PIs lead to

13

specific disruption of normal splicing. We suggest interference of splicing as an

14

additional mechanism of action of PIs not previously explored. Inhibition of

15

splicing has recently become a promising therapeutic strategy in other

16

hematologic malignancies (15). Our results reveal an intersection of cellular

17

stress and the splicing machinery, which may have broad relevance in biology.

18

Furthermore, we propose the spliceosome as a new and potentially selective

19

therapeutic target in myeloma.

RESULTS

22
23

Proteasome inhibition results in sustained phosphorylation of splicing

24

factors in myeloma plasma cells

25

We first used unbiased phosphoproteomics to examine the signaling-level

26

response of MM.1S multiple myeloma cells to Cfz. We chose time points across

27

24 hours for analysis based on our prior results demonstrating that the

28

transcriptional and proteomic response to proteasome inhibition evolves over

29

many hours (9). This is in contrast with the majority of prior perturbation

30

phosphoproteomic studies, which have typically examined direct effects on

31

kinase activation or inhibition on a timescale of minutes (14). Here, we instead

1

consider the indirect effects on phosphorylation induced by PI exposure. Using

2

label-free quantification of immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC)-

3

isolated phosphopeptides, we indeed found that altered phosphorylation

4

signatures were most prominent 24 hours after treatment (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1). In

5

total, we quantified 5791 phosphosites in at least one technical replicate of the

6

time course, with >99% of phosphosites representing Ser or Thr phosphorylation

7

events, as expected using this enrichment technique. Notably, with 30 nM Cfz,

8

cell viability was approximately 30% of baseline, indicating significant drug-

9

induced cytotoxicity by this final time point.

10

At each time point we simultaneously performed single-end RNA-seq to

11

determine gene expression to compare with our phosphoproteomic results. Fig.

12

1B shows 58 upregulated (red) and 75 downregulated (blue) phosphopeptides

13

from proteins with largely unchanged RNA transcript abundance as detected by

14

unsupervised hierarchical clustering. Upon this initial analysis, we were

15

encouraged to find decreased phosphorylation of the translation factor EIF4E-

16

BP1 as well as the ribosomal subunit RPS6 (Fig. 1B). These phosphorylation-

17

level responses related to suppressed translation are expected upon PI-induced

18

cellular stress (9). While other downregulated phosphopeptides did not suggest a

19

specific highly-enriched biological function, upon manual inspection of

20

upregulated phosphosites we were surprised to find that 14 of 58 were present

21

on proteins related to pre-mRNA splicing. These primarily included

22

phosphopeptides deriving from the heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein (HNRNP)

23

family of proteins as well as phosphopeptides belonging to the SRSF family of

24

splicing factors (Fig. 1B). In particular, the arginine- and serine-rich “RS” domain

25

of the SRSF proteins are known to have their splicing activity modulated by

26

phosphorylation (16). Notably, these prominent signaling-level effects on splicing

27

factors were invisible to prior gene expression studies of PI response and have

28

not been investigated previously. We therefore chose to further explore the

29

interaction between PIs and the splicing machinery.

30
31

To validate this initial result from label free quantitative proteomics, we
prepared independent samples using a stable isotope labeling (SILAC)

phosphoproteomics approach. Based on our results above, we examined only

2

the 24 hr time point in MM.1S cells. We evaluated both a low dose (10 nM, n = 2

3

biological replicates) and a moderate dose (18 nM, n = 2) of Cfz (Fig. 2A-B).

4

With this lot of Cfz, 10 nM drug elicited ~20% cell death after 24 hr, while 18 nM

5

killed ~85% of cells (Fig. S3A). Of the 520 phosphosites significantly (p < 0.05; ≥

6

2-fold-change) upregulated in MM.1S treated with 18 nM Cfz in Fig. 2A, 127

7

(24.4%) are associated with splicing-related proteins, with 23 of these as part of

8

the SRSF protein family of splicing factors. Background-corrected Gene Ontology

9

(GO) analysis confirms that all of the top enriched biological processes involve

10

RNA splicing regulation and mRNA processing (Fig. S1B, 2E). At 10 nM Cfz,

11

though, this signaling response is much weaker with only 25 upregulated

12

phosphosites; none of these are splicing-related. These results suggest that

13

there is a strong dose-response effect of phosphorylation changes after

14

proteasome inhibition, both across splicing factors and the broader proteome.

15

To compare these changes at the signaling level to changes at the protein

16

level, unenriched peptides were also analyzed by LC-MS/MS (Fig. S2A-B).

17

Confirming expected responses to proteasome inhibition, the most upregulated

18

proteins included heat shock-induced chaperones as well as SQSTM1/p62

19

associated with autophagy (9). In contrast, splicing factors with increased

20

phosphorylation sites do not significantly change in abundance, confirming that

21

phosphosite increases are due to changes at the signaling level and not protein

22

copy number.

23
24
25

Melphalan induces a similar but not identical phosphorylation response
We next investigated whether this broad splicing factor phosphorylation

26

phenotype was unique to proteasome inhibition or was also seen under a

27

different drug mechanism of action. We chose to compare the response of

28

MM.1S cells to melphalan, a DNA alkylating agent and clinically-used myeloma

29

therapeutic. In parallel, we also treated another MM cell line, AMO-1, with Cfz to

30

determine if the phosphorylation response to proteasome inhibitor is consistent

31

across cell line models.

1

For these experiments we again used a single-timepoint SILAC approach.

2

Here, both 10 µM melphalan and 15 nM Cfz led to ~20% cell death in MM.1S

3

and AMO-1, respectively, at 24 hr (Fig. S3A). Western blot confirmed induction

4

of DNA damage by melphalan and proteotoxic stress response for Cfz (Fig. S3C-

5

D). Compared to 18 nM Cfz, we saw largely decreased phosphorylation-level

6

responses to both of these agents (Fig. 2C-D). Of 113 phosphosites significantly

7

upregulated in AMO-1, 7 belong to splicing related proteins (SRSF2, SRSF6,

8

SRRM1, HNRNPH1, TRA2A, DDX1). This result is consistent with the MM.1S

9

results in Fig. 2A-B, where greater PI response correlates with more prominent

10
11

phosphorylation changes.
Under 10 µM melphalan, 93 phosphosites were significantly upregulated,

12

with 8 sites on splicing related proteins (HNRNPK, TRA2A, SRRM2, and

13

WDR77), although none are SRSF family members (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, as

14

expected, both unenriched shotgun proteomics and RNA-seq for gene

15

expression confirm that proteasome inhibition and DNA damage elicit different

16

responses (Fig. S2A-E). Again, no splicing factors with altered phosphosites

17

under either drug treatment were changed at the protein abundance level.

18

We further performed Kinase Set Enrichment Analysis (KSEA) (17) on our

19

MM.1S datasets to identify kinases whose activity may regulate differential

20

phosphorylation found by phosphoproteomics. While this tool is limited by its

21

reliance on well-characterized kinase-substrate relationships, and despite the

22

different number of phosphosites upregulated under each condition, within this

23

framework this tool identified similar kinases active under both 18 nM Cfz and 10

24

µM melphalan treatment (Fig. 2F). Notably, both drugs are predicted to induce

25

activity of cdc2-like kinase 1 (CLK1), a kinase known to phosphorylate SRSF

26

family splicing factors among other proteins (18). However, in line with the

27

specific biology of PIs, Cfz also strongly induced inhibitory kappa B kinase

28

(IKBKB) activity, a kinase leading to NF-kB inhibition after PI treatment (19).

29

Taken together, these results indicate that drug-induced stress may broadly lead

30

to phosphorylation of splicing factors, though precise patterns of phosphorylation

31

may differ in a drug-specific manner.

3

SRSF splicing factors appear highly phosphorylated at baseline in MM cells
To investigate our phosphoproteomic results via an orthogonal method,

4

we performed Western blots to evaluate for phosphorylation-induced gel mobility

5

shift after Cfz treatment of SRSF1, SRSF3, and SRSF6. After Cfz treatment and

6

isolation of the cytoplasm, we initially saw no discernable shift of these proteins.

7

However, treatment of lysate with calf alkaline phosphatase resulted in a

8

substantial shift of SRSF proteins but not actin (Fig. S3F). Therefore, these

9

SRSF factors exist in a highly phosphorylated state even at baseline in MM

10

plasma cells. Upregulated phosphorylation post-Cfz identified by mass

11

spectrometry may therefore represent additional phosphorylation at only selected

12

phosphosites. While these changes in phosphorylation may still result in

13

biological effects, Cfz-induced modulation does not appear to reflect a dramatic

14

shift in the overall phosphorylation status of these SRSF proteins in this system.

15

To further investigate baseline phosphorylation status of SRSF proteins,

16

we treated MM.1S cells with 50 µM KH-CB19 (20), a reported highly selective

17

inhibitor of the SRSF kinases CLK1 and CLK4 (KD = 20 nM vs. CLK1). We did

18

not observe any viability effects in MM.1S even at this high concentration (Fig.

19

S3A). Unbiased phosphoproteomics after 24 hr of KH-CB19 treatment

20

surprisingly showed no significant change in phosphorylation status of any

21

quantified SRSF phosphosites, except one upregulated (Fig. S2F). These results

22

suggest that other kinases also play a role in maintaining SRSF phosphorylation

23

in this system, either at baseline or via feedback mechanisms after sustained

24

CLK1 inhibition.

25
26

Proteasome inhibition induces intron retention in MM cells

27

Given our results demonstrating splicing factor phosphorylation, we next

28

investigated whether pre-mRNA splicing itself was altered after drug treatment.

29

We obtained paired-end sequencing data from polyA-enriched RNA on the same

30

samples used for phosophoproteomics, plus one additional biological replicate (n

31

= 3 total) of each of the following: MM.1S treated with 18 nM Cfz, with 10 µM

1

melphalan, and with DMSO as control; and AMO-1 treated with 15 nM Cfz and

2

with DMSO as control. We used JuncBASE (21) to process the aligned

3

sequencing data by identifying and quantifying both annotated and novel splice

4

junctions. Data for each alternative splicing event was evaluated using the

5

standard measure of “percent spliced in” or PSI (ψ) (Fig. 3A).

6

Comparative analysis of differential PSI (ΔPSI) between 18 nM Cfz- and

7

DMSO-treated MM.1S were considered according to categories including

8

alternative exon acceptor (3’ splice site selection), alt. donor (5’ splice site

9

selection), alt. last exon, alt. first exon, alt. exon cassette, and intron retention

10

(IR) (Fig. 3B, Supplementary Table S3). The ΔPSI distribution for IR

11

demonstrated the greatest positive shift after Cfz treatment (n = 25,807 total IR

12

events measured; median = 2.54). ΔPSI medians for alternative splice site

13

selection also demonstrated a significant shift (alt. donor median = 1.64, n =

14

9,188 and alt. acceptor median = 0.81, n = 9,352). All other categories were

15

closer to a median of zero (p < 2.2E-16 for median of IR distribution, alt. donor,

16

and alt. acceptor vs. median of cassette by Mann-Whitney test, Supplementary

17

Table S3). Intriguingly, PIs are well known to induce a strong heat shock

18

response (12) and prior work in non-cancer cells demonstrated that heat shock

19

alone could impair splicing and induce IR without broadly affecting other

20

alternative splicing events (22, 23). In general, intron-retained transcripts may be

21

subject to nonsense-mediated decay or retained in the nucleus where they

22

remain untranslated. Our results suggest that a similar splicing impairment may

23

be present in MM cells exposed to PI.

24

We then considered the possibility that the IR phenotype results from a

25

global dysfunction of the splicing machinery during drug-induced apoptosis,

26

which is likely occurring with ~85% cell death at our high-dose Cfz treatment. Our

27

prior proteomic data indicated that SF3B1 and U2AF2, core components of the

28

splicing machinery, are some of the earliest substrates cleaved by caspases

29

during PI-induced apoptosis (9). Indeed, by Western blotting we validated that

30

SF3B1 and U2AF2 are proteolytically cleaved after Cfz treatment and this

31

cleavage can be blocked by the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk (Fig. S3E).

10

1

These caspase cleavage events, then, could be responsible for the IR

2

phenomenon.

3

However, we found a similar shift in IR distribution in AMO-1 cells treated

4

with 15 nM Cfz (n = 27,386; median = 2.2) (Fig. 3C) despite much less cytoxicity

5

(~20%) than the 18 nM Cfz treatment in MM.1S. As caspase cleavage correlates

6

with degree of cell death, it therefore appears unlikely that cytotoxicity alone is

7

responsible for IR. Notably, an even smaller shift was observed in IR for MM.1S

8

with 10 µM melphalan treatment, also at ~20% cytotoxicity (n = 24,247; median =

9

0.44; p < 2.2E-16 for IR distribution MM.1S 18 nM Cfz vs 10 µM melphalan).

10

Instead, after melphalan the greatest ΔPSI shift occurred with alt. exon cassettes

11

(single cassette median = 1.06, n = 12,267, coordinated cassette median = 1.75,

12

n = 1,417, Fig. 3D). Even if we only consider statistically significant IR events (p

13

< 0.05), the ΔPSI distributions for the drug responses remain distinct (Fig. S4A-

14

B). Fig. 3E compares the GO enrichment of all significant ASEs induced by Cfz

15

and by melphalan and shows divergent classes of genes alternatively spliced.

16

Therefore, while melphalan also affects alternative splicing it appears to do so via

17

a different mechanism than Cfz (24).

18

Intriguingly, in the case of AMO-1 treated with 15 nM Cfz, we noticed the

19

ΔPSI shift for alternative splice sites (alt. acceptor median = 0.40, n = 9,620; alt.

20

donor median = 0.61, n = 8,116, Fig. 3C, Supplementary Table S3) were

21

decreased compared to MM.1S treated with 18 nM Cfz. Notably, this finding also

22

correlates with the lesser degree of splicing factor phosphorylation (Fig. 2).

23

These findings illustrate a more pronounced IR phenotype after PI than DNA

24

damage, irrespective of the amount of cell death, while alternative exonic splice

25

site determination may be a dose-response behavior.

26
27

Exogenous expression of SRSF1 wildtype and RS-domain mutants do not

28

significantly alter splicing patterns

29

Having shown that proteasome inhibition can lead to both robust splicing

30

factor phosphorylation as well as widespread IR of pre-mRNA, we next

31

considered whether these processes are causally linked or whether they instead

11

1

occur via parallel mechanisms. To initially investigate this question, we

2

considered SRSF1 (also known as SF2 or ASF), a well-characterized member of

3

the SR family of splicing factors and a putative proto-oncogene (16, 25). All

4

members of this family contain RNA recognition motifs (RRM) and arginine- and

5

serine-rich domains (RS) (16). In general, SR proteins recognize cis-acting splice

6

enhancers on pre-mRNA and work to promote splicing by initially recruiting the

7

spliceosome to these intron-exon junctions (16). We found that SRSF1

8

demonstrates upregulated phosphorylation at sites in both the RS1 and RS2

9

domain when MM cells are treated with Cfz (Fig. 2A, Supplementary Table S4).

10

The current model of SRSF1 function suggests that 1) SR-protein kinases

11

(SRPK)-mediated phosphorylation of RS domain leads to translocation into the

12

nucleus, 2) further hyperphosphorylation by CLK1 causes association with the

13

U1 spliceosome, and 3) partial dephosphorylation is required for splicing

14

catalysis (16, 26, 27).

15

To study the effects of SRSF1 phosphorylation in MM, we exogenously

16

expressed a wildtype (SRSF1-WT), phosphomimetic (SRSF1-SD), or

17

phosphodead (SRSF1-SA) variant in AMO-1 plasma cells. We assumed an all-

18

or-none model of SR protein phosphorylation, where exogenous SRSF1 mutants

19

have all 20 serines in the RS1 and RS2 domains replaced with either an

20

aspartate (SD) or an alanine (SA). Exogenously expressed SRSF1 proteins are

21

tagged with a C-terminal mCherry, nuclear localization signal (NLS) and 3x

22

FLAG-peptide (Fig. 4A). It is known that phosphorylation of the RS1 domain is

23

necessary for nuclear localization (28, 29); the attempted forced nuclear

24

localization of the SA mutant was chosen to probe potential splicing-level effects

25

of phospho-dead SRSF1 interacting with the spliceosome. Immunoblot confirms

26

expression of exogenous SRSF1 constructs, which migrate higher than

27

endogenous SRSF1 (Fig. S4E), and demonstrates lower expression than the

28

high-abundance endogenous protein. Epi-fluorescent images in Fig. 4B show the

29

distribution of exogenous SRSF1-WT, SD, and SA mutants. Notably, most of WT

30

and SD signal is localized to the nucleus, suggestive of functional protein product

31

and consistent with expected biology. However, a much larger fraction of SA

1

mutant is trapped in the cytosol despite NLS tagging. Consistent with prior work

2

(30, 31), this finding suggests that phosphorylation of RS domains is a major

3

requirement for entry into the nucleus.

4

Upon JuncBASE analysis of poly-A RNA-seq data from DMSO-treated

5

WT, SD, and SA construct (n = 3 for each), we saw remarkably few global

6

differences in PSI as a function of modeled SRSF1 phosphorylation status (Fig.

7

4D). Notably, our results in Fig. 1B suggested that phosphorylation of multiple

8

splicing factors, including other SRSF proteins, occurs simultaneously under Cfz-

9

induced stress; we find that altered phosphorylation of SRSF1 alone may not

10

carry any significant effects.

11
12

SRSF1 RS-domain phosphomimetic mutant demonstrates weakened

13

interaction with the spliceosome

14

Though we cannot draw a direct link between SRSF1 phosphorylation

15

status and specific alternative splicing events, we further investigated the diverse

16

biological roles of SRSF1. In addition to modulating pre-mRNA splicing, these

17

include regulating nuclear export of spliced mRNAs and translational regulation

18

in the cytosol via interaction with the ribosome (32-34). Using the 3x-FLAG tag

19

on constructs we performed affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) with

20

label-free quantitative proteomics vs. an mCherry-NLS-[FLAG]3 control. We

21

specifically evaluated differential binding partners of SRSF1 as a function of

22

phosphorylation status across both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments.

23

While clear differences were observed between the nuclear and cytosolic

24

interactome for each construct, overall biological signatures based on GO

25

analysis were surprisingly similar across WT, SD, and SA within each

26

compartment (Fig. S5B, D, F). Notably, in the cytosol we found consistent

27

interactions between both SRSF1-WT and SRSF1-SD with several RNA-binding

28

proteins as well as components of the translational machinery. We do note one

29

stark difference between WT and the phosphomimetic mutant in the nuclear

30

fraction: the WT construct showed direct evidence of interaction with several

31

small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) polypeptides, core components of the

U1-U2 spliceosome (Fig. 4E). Unexpectedly, these nuclear interactions were not

2

enriched in the SD construct, which instead interacted with other splicing-related

3

factors such as TRA2A, TRA2B, and PABPN (Fig. 4F). This interactome

4

mapping may help refine the current model of SRSF1 biology, which suggests

5

that hyperphosphorylation of RS domains leads to preferential integration with

6

the U1 spliceosome (35, 36) and would explain the lack of change seen in global

7

alternative splicing in the SD expressing cells.

Proteasome inhibition of MM cells results in both stochastic intron
retention and specific alternative exon usage
We next explored the splicing-level effects of 15 nM Cfz treatment on

12

AMO-1 cells expressing the WT, SD, and SA constructs. Notably, in this setting

13

cytotoxicity at 24 hr was <10% in 8 of 9 total replicates (Fig. S4D). Compared to

14

DMSO-treated samples (Fig. 4C), Cfz again elicited a response consistent with

15

that found in Fig. 3C: despite minimal cell death, we observed a clear shift in the

16

median ΔPSI toward increased global IR (n = 12,139; median = 2.45, p < 2.2E-16

17

for one-sample Wilcoxon summed rank test). These findings in the absence of

18

apoptosis underscore that caspase cleavage of splicing factors is unlikely to be a

19

primary mechanism of IR after PI.

20

The combined RNA-seq dataset of all Cfz-treated samples vs. DMSO for

21

these additional SRSF1 constructs were analyzed together (Fig. 5A) with

22

JuncBASE (n = 24 replicates total across all AMO-1, including data in Fig. 3C,

23

4C). With this increased statistical power, we were able to identify CNNM3, which

24

encodes a divalent metal cation transporter, as showing among the strongest

25

signatures of IR across all events (FDR-corrected p = 0.032) (Fig. S4G).

26

However, despite detecting n = 22,559 IR events by JuncBASE (Fig. 5B, left),

27

very few individual transcripts (n = 43, including CNNM3) showed statistically

28

significant (FDR-corrected p < 0.05) IR across replicates (Fig. 5B, right). This

29

finding suggests that Cfz-induced IR may be a stochastic process, perhaps

30

resulting from general interference with the splicing machinery without a coherent

31

selection for specific transcripts.

1

In contrast, alternative exon splice site usage (alternative exon donor (n =

2

1134) and alternative exon acceptor (n = 810)) emerged as the dominant type of

3

alternative splicing when considering only statistically significant events (Fig.

4

5B). We investigated whether these consistently observed alternative splicing

5

events may carry some biological relevance. Interestingly, GO enrichment

6

analysis of all the genes undergoing significant alternative splicing after Cfz (n =

7

2,575 events total across all categories in Fig. 5B, right) revealed ‘proteasome-

8

mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process’ (p = 2.08E-16) and

9

‘protein polyubiquitination‘ (p = 1.39E-13) as highly enriched (Fig. 5C). Notably,

10

multiple proteasome subunits (PSMA3/5/7, PSMB4/5, PSMC1/4/5, PSMD1-4,

11

PSME2), the protein homeostasis node p97 (VCP), and ubiquitin (UBB, UBC) all

12

undergo some degree of alternative splicing with Cfz (example in Fig. 5D). These

13

findings raise the possibility that alternative splicing may modulate the protein

14

homeostasis machinery in response to therapeutic proteasome inhibition.

15

Taken together, our results offer a model for the effects of proteasome

16

inhibition on the splicing machinery in myeloma (Fig. 5E). Upon therapeutic

17

insult, the stress response induces phosphorylation of multiple splicing factors.

18

Though the effect of this phosphorylation on specific splicing events remains

19

unclear, these events may relate to specific alterations in exon usage based on

20

known SRSF biochemistry. Our analysis of specific exon usage suggests that

21

modification of the proteasome itself via alternative splicing may play a role in

22

adaptation or resistance to proteasome inhibitor. In parallel, we observe a broad

23

increase in the number of stochastically distributed IR events. These IR events,

24

expected to reduce the number of functional protein products, may work to

25

generally reduce proteotoxic stress and conserve cellular resources normally

26

devoted to protein synthesis, thereby playing a role in adaptation to proteasome

27

inhibition. Alternatively, the intron retention phenotype may indicate malfunction

28

of the spliceosome, an essential process whose loss reduces tumor cell fitness.

29

Interference with splicing may therefore be a previously unappreciated part of the

30

PI mechanism of action.

1

The spliceosome inhibitor E7107 is broadly potent versus MM cells and

2

synergistic with proteasome inhibitor

3

Extending from this potential new mechanism of action of PIs as

4

interfering with splicing, we further investigated the therapeutic potential of more

5

dramatic spliceosome disruption in myeloma. For our preclinical studies we

6

employed the tool compound E7107, a pladienolide B analog and direct inhibitor

7

of the core U2 catalytic spliceosome component SF3B1 (15). This molecule has

8

recently been described to induce extreme IR and strong cytotoxic effects versus

9

models of myeloid malignancy, particularly those carrying mutations within

10
11

splicing factors (37).
Using both qPCR validation of canonical IR events after SF3B1 inhibition

12

(38) (Fig. S6B) as well as JuncBASE analysis of RNA-seq data (Fig. 6A), as

13

expected we identified very significant IR after 6h of 10 nM E7107 treatment in

14

MM.1S cells (ΔPSI median = 13.79, n = 30,666). There was no noted cytotoxicity

15

at this early time point (Fig. S6A). This finding supports the previous conclusion

16

that splicing impairment, not apoptosis, induces IR. However, unlike the PI

17

response, we also observed massive global loss of cassette exon splicing under

18

E7107 (ΔPSI median = -16.6, n = 24,053, Fig. S6D). Furthermore, the number of

19

significant (p < 0.05) IR events remained very high with E7107 (n = 7,171), unlike

20

the apparently stochastic IR events seen with PI (Fig. S6C). Altogether, this

21

suggests that PI-induced impairment of splicing is a partial interference of normal

22

splicing operations, unlike the total abrogation of splicing seen with E7107.

23

Underscoring the potential of splicing inhibition as a therapeutic strategy in MM,

24

E7107 was extremely potent versus a panel of seven MM cell lines treated for 48

25

hr, with LC50’s ranging from <1 nM to 30 nM (Fig. 6B). In addition, a PI-resistant

26

AMO-1 cell line (39) showed very similar sensitivity to E7107 as the parental line

27

(Fig. 6C). This finding suggests the potential for clinical utility of splicing inhibition

28

even in PI-refractory disease.

29

We noted that our MM cell line sensitivities appeared essentially bimodal,

30

with one group of more sensitive lines with LC50’s of <1 nM and another slightly

31

less sensitive group of cell lines with LC50 of 20-50 nM. In an attempt to identify

1

potential determinants of this differential drug sensitivity, we examined publicly

2

available RNA-seq data of baseline gene expression in MM cell lines

3

(www.keatslab.org). We were intrigued to find that the more sensitive lines

4

demonstrated significantly higher RNA expression of SF3B1 (Fig. 6D). This

5

outcome hinted that more sensitive cell lines may somehow be more “addicted”

6

to SF3B1, leaving them more vulnerable to splicing inhibition, as well as

7

revealing a potential biomarker that could be used for patient stratification.

8

Unfortunately, this result was not confirmed at the protein level (Fig. 6E),

9

suggesting that SF3B1 may undergo post-transcriptional regulation. We found no

10

other candidates for markers of sensitivity or resistance to E7107 based on

11

available DNA or RNA sequencing data from this limited cohort of cell lines.

12

We further explored the hypothesis that interfering with splicing via two

13

different mechanisms may lead to synergistic MM cell death. Indeed,

14

combination studies with Cfz and E7107 showed strong synergy across the

15

dosing landscape based on ZIP synergy scoring (40) (Fig. 6F-G). In contrast,

16

melphalan, which induced much less IR than PI (Fig. 3B-C), showed much

17

weaker synergy in combination with E7107 (Fig. 6H-I). These findings support

18

the approach of using splicing inhibitors in combination with PIs in MM treatment.

19

Also, this result strengthens the hypothesis that splicing interference is a part of

20

the PI mechanism of action.

E7107 is a highly potent versus myeloma both in vivo and ex vivo
Based on this encouraging in vitro data, we then moved into a standard in

vivo MM model of luciferase-labeled MM.1S cells implanted intravenously into

25

NOD scid gamma (NSG) immunocompromised mice. These cells home to the

26

murine bone marrow, partially recapitulating the tumor microenvironment in

27

human disease (41). We found that E7107 was generally well-tolerated with no

28

appreciable weight loss (Fig. S7A). At 3 mg/kg E7107 I.V., a relatively low dose

29

compared to prior studies in other malignancies (37), we still found pronounced

anti-MM effect after a brief 2 week treatment (Fig. 7A-C). This suppression of

tumor translated into a significant survival benefit (p = 0.01, log-ranked test; n = 6

2

per arm).

3

We next turned to ex vivo evaluation versus primary patient samples.

4

Fresh bone marrow mononuclear cells from seven PI-refractory MM patients

5

were treated for 48 hr with varying doses of E7107. Based on flow cytometry

6

analysis of CD138+ plasma cells (Fig. S7B), we found similar high sensitivity of

7

patient tumor cells to E7107 as found in cell lines, with estimated LC50’s in the

8

low-nM range (Fig. 7D). Notably, non-plasma cell bone marrow mononuclear

9

cells (CD138- fraction) showed remarkably little cytotoxicity at these same doses,

10

supporting a potential therapeutic index for splicing inhibitors in MM.

Functional genomics and whole exome sequencing suggests clinical

13

applications of splicing inhibition in MM

14

Analysis of CRISPR essentiality screen data in the Cancer Dependency

15

Map (www.depmap.org; Avana library public 18Q4 (42)), across over 400 cancer

16

cell lines, demonstrated that myeloma has among the strongest genetic

17

dependencies on the target of E7107, SF3B1 (Fig. S7C). This genetic ablation

18

data further supports the ability to pharmacologically eliminate MM tumor cells

19

via splicing inhibition while sparing normal cells. We further extended this

20

analysis to other core components of the U1-U2 spliceosome found to be

21

“common essential” genes per DepMap (43). By aggregating DepMap rankings,

22

we found that MM cell lines are the most sensitive tumor cell type to genetic

23

ablation of these central snRNP protein components, necessary for association

24

with pre-mRNA and splicing catalysis (Fig. 7E). Compared to the essential

25

subunits of the 20S proteasome (including the direct PI target PSMB5) (Fig.

26

S7D), we surprisingly found more favorable genetic evidence for targeting the

27

spliceosome in MM than the proteasome.

28

Furthermore, a recent study validated the sulfonamide indisulam as an

29

inhibitor of splicing via targeted degradation of RBM39, another component of the

30

spliceosome with high homology to U2AF2 (44). In this work, hematopoeitic

31

malignancy cell lines were broadly more sensitive to indisulam than solid tumor

1

cell lines. We confirmed cytotoxicity of indisulam versus a panel of MM cell lines

2

(Fig. S7E), though LC50’s (0.3 - >20 µM) were much higher than those for the

3

SF3B1 inhibitor E7107. In DepMap data, MM was again among the more

4

sensitive tumor type to RBM39 ablation (Fig. S7F). Indisulam may therefore

5

represent another approach to targeting the spliceosome in this disease, though

6

given lower potency the potential for clinical translation is less clear.

7

We next took advantage of genomic and transcriptomic data from isolated

8

malignant plasma cells from newly-diagnosed MM patients in the Multiple

9

Myeloma Research Foundation CoMMpass study (research.themmrf.org; version

10

IA11). First evaluating gene expression data, we intriguingly found significantly

11

decreased progression-free survival among patients in the top quartile of SRSF1

12

expression versus those in the bottom quartile (p = 0.0081 by log-ranked test)

13

and a trend toward similarly decreased overall survival for patients in the top vs.

14

bottom quartile of SF3B1 expression (p = 0.087) (Fig. S7G). These results raise

15

the possibility of poorer outcomes in patients whose disease is more dependent

16

on the spliceosome.

17

However, we note that both E7107 (37) and the recently described

18

splicing inhibitor H3B-8800 (38) have both been shown to have the greatest

19

potency versus hematopoietic malignancies carrying mutations in splicing factors

20

such as SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF2, and ZRSR2 (45). These mutations are seen

21

frequently in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia, and

22

chronic lymphocytic leukemia, appearing in up to 50% of MDS patients (45). We

23

therefore examined exome sequencing data available in CoMMpass and found

24

that 28.0% of MM patients (268 of 956) were found to carry missense mutations

25

within at least one of 119 splicing-associated factors recently proposed to be

26

most relevant to tumorigenesis across a survey of the The Cancer Genome Atlas

27

(Fig. 7F, Supplementary Table S6) (46). While only a small minority of these

28

identified mutations has been functionally validated to affect splicing, the most

29

common single mutation was at the known “hotspot” SF3B1 K666T, found in

30

three patients. Variant allele frequencies for these expected heterozygous

31

mutations were 42%, 35%, and 22%, suggestive of a prominent subclonal

1

fraction of the tumor cell population. Among well-characterized genes, mutations

2

were found in SF3B1 (n = 10 patients, including K666T mutations), SRSF2 (n =

3

2), U2AF1 (n = 4), and ZRSR2 (n = 1). Unfortunately we were unable to obtain

4

rare primary patient samples containing mutations in these genes, and no

5

myeloma cell lines are known to carry hotspot mutations in these well-

6

characterized splicing factors (www.keatslab.org). While our data suggest that

7

spliceosome inhibition should be considered a therapeutic option for MM patients

8

of any genotype, recent work in other malignancies (37, 38) supports the

9

potential for particular benefit in the subset of patients carrying pathogenic

10

splicing factor mutations.

11
12
13

DISCUSSION:
Our results demonstrate that PI therapy in myeloma leads to both specific

14

alterations in splice site usage and broad-scale interference with spliceosome

15

function. This observation, initially generated through unbiased

16

phosphoproteomics, led us to explore the spliceosome itself as a MM

17

vulnerability. Our preclinical evaluation and analysis of functional genomics and

18

exome sequencing data further reinforced the spliceosome as a therapeutic

19

target in MM.

20

These results raise a number of intriguing questions. From a mechanistic

21

perspective, prior work examining SR phosphorylation after cellular perturbation

22

using Western blotting did not consistently show a broad hyperphosphorylation

23

signature (47-49). Our results therefore illustrate the utility of unbiased

24

phosphoproteomics to elucidate cancer drug response. Recent work suggests

25

that additional kinases beyond the well-characterized SRPKs and CLKs may be

26

involved in SR phosphorylation (50, 51). However, in the context of drug-induced

27

stress in cancer, the mechanism that leads to coordinated, upregulated

28

phosphorylation across multiple splicing factors, whether via kinase activation or

29

phosphatase inhibition, will be an important topic for future investigation.

30
31

We also found a correlation between PI-induced stress and both SR factor
phosphorylation and the degree of alternative exon selection. This finding

20

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/508549; this version posted February 3, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

1

appears consistent with prior studies (16) suggesting that SR factors play a role

2

in exon selection and their activity can be modulated by phosphorylation. Why

3

these effects specifically lead to alternative splicing of protein homeostasis genes

4

remains to be investigated. In contrast, we found IR to be largely independent of

5

the degree of PI-induced stress. This result suggests that the IR phenotype is

6

mediated by a different mechanism and uncoupled from SR factor

7

phosphorylation.

8
9

In attempting to model the relationship between SR phosphorylation and
splicing, we recognize our phosphomimetic construct likely does not fully

10

recapitulate the complex phosphorylation biology of SRSF1 within cells (27), nor

11

does it fully match the level of expression of endogenous SRSF1. In general,

12

causal links have been noted between SRSF1 phosphorylation and splicing in

13

single transcript, in vitro systems (34, 52, 53), but isolating global effects of SR

14

phosphorylation on splicing within cells have remained elusive. Furthermore,

15

using genetic approaches we cannot readily model phosphorylation changes on

16

multiple SR proteins simultaneously, which may be necessary to elicit broader

17

phenotypic effects. Despite these limitations, however, our WT expression

18

studies provide a landscape of the SRSF1 cytosolic and nuclear interactome,

19

which may inform future studies of SR protein biology in myeloma and other

20

systems.

21

This PI-induced interference with normal splicing even at minimal

22

cytotoxicity, much greater than that found with melphalan, may relate to the

23

activation of the heat shock response. We found prominent heat shock

24

chaperone induction even under a non-cytotoxic dose of the PI bortezomib in

25

MM.1S cells (10). As previously shown in non-cancer cells, heat shock alone,

26

without cell death, can lead to significant intron retention (23). One hypothesis is

27

that this broad-scale inhibition of splicing acts in a similar fashion to translational

28

inhibition after drug-induced stress: a way to conserve cellular resources and

29

focus on only producing genes required for survival and the stress response.

30

However, as described in our model of Fig. 5E, and evidenced by our mRNA-seq

31

data after E7107 treatment (Fig. 6A), another possible result of widespread

21

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/508549; this version posted February 3, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

1

intron retention and downstream loss of normal protein production is significant

2

decrease in cellular fitness and ultimately, cell death. There may be a

3

quantitative threshold effect between these two outcomes that remains to be

4

elucidated.

5

Here, we propose that the loss-of-fitness modality of drug-induced IR

6

constitutes a previously unexplored mechanism of action of PIs. We further

7

performed a preclinical evaluation of splicing inhibition in myeloma using E7107,

8

finding potent anti-myeloma effects in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo versus primary

9

patient samples. From a therapeutic perspective, one of the major questions is

10

the potential toxicity of targeting such an essential process as the catalytic

11

spliceosome. However, our analysis of genetic dependency data and our ex vivo

12

data with E7107 clearly demonstrates the potential to target core spliceosome

13

subunits in MM while largely sparing normal cells. In fact, based on this analysis

14

the spliceosome appears to be an even more promising target than the clinically-

15

validated approach of targeting essential subunits of the proteasome.

16

Furthermore, presumed efficacious doses (based on measured blood

17

concentrations in the nM range) of E7107 were largely well tolerated in a Phase I

18

clinical trial (54). While this molecule is no longer in clinical development, it is

19

thought that E7107 visual toxicity was molecule-specific and is not a function of

20

targeting the spliceosome in general (15). Our genomic analysis suggests that

21

mutations in splicing factors are found in a substantial fraction of MM patients.

22

Newer generations of splicing inhibitors are currently in clinical trials for other

23

hematologic malignancies (38) (NCT02841540) and may be of particular benefit

24

for these patients. Our results support clinical investigation of these compounds

25

in MM either alone or to enhance PI efficacy as combination therapy.

Drug cytotoxicity assay

6

For dose-response cell toxicity assays, 1E+3 myeloma cells were seeded per

7

well in 384 well plates (Corning) using the Multidrop Combi (Thermo Fisher) and

8

incubated for 24 hr. In monotherapy cytotoxicity assays, cells were treated with

9

drug or DMSO and incubated for 48 hr, while cells were further incubated with

10

E7107 (H3) for an additional 24 hr in E7107 dual therapy combination assays.

11

Carfilzomib (SelleckChem, S2853-50mg), melphalan (Sigma, S2853-50mg), and

12

E7107 (H3 Biomedicine, CAS:630100-90-2), and KH-CB19 (sc-362756) were

13

solubilized in DMSO at 10 mM.

14
15

All cell viability was determined with Cell-Titer Glo reagent (Promega, G7573)

16

using a Glomax Explorer (Promega) luminescence plate reader. For the drug

17

titration cytotoxicity assays, measurements were performed in quadruplicate,

18

while measurements were performed in triplicate in all other assays, and

19

viabilities are reported as mean (+/- S.D.) ratio normalized to DMSO-treated

20

controls or measurements at 0 hr. For ZIP synergy calculations, normalized

21

viability data was submitted to SynergyFinder web application (40).

Drug dosing for proteomics and RNA-seq experiments

24

Proteomic/phosphoproteomic/RNA-seq experiments were performed at a cell

25

density of 1E6 cells/mL. For timecourse studies, ~20E6 cells were grown in

26

complete media for each timepoint (0, 8, 16, and 24 hr), whereas for single-

27

timepoint experiments, 15-20E+6 cells in light SILAC media were treated with

28

drug compound and cells in heavy SILAC media (L-Lysine-13C6,15N2, L-Arginine-

Cloning and lentiviral transduction

6

SRSF1 and mCherry genes, along with 3X FLAG sequences and nuclear

7

localization signal (NLS) were cloned into pLV-416G second generation lentiviral

8

plasmid (UCSF HMTB) by Gibson Assembly. SRSF1 constructs were transfected

9

into Lenti-X 293T(Takara Bioscience, 632180) packaging cells with Gag-Pol

10

expressing pCMV-dR8.91 (Addgene, Plasmid#2221) and VSV-G envelope

11

expressing pMD2.G (Addgene, Plasmid#12259) plasmids. Viral particles were

12

harvested, concentrated with Lenti-X concentrator (Takara Bioscience, 631231)

13

and viral titers were incubated with AMO-1 cells. Positively transduced cells were

14

selected with selection drug, G418 (VWR, 970-3-058), for several passages, then

15

by mCherry expression with Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS, Sony

16

SH800). Protocol details are found in Supplementary Information.

Phosphoproteomic peptide preparation

19

Frozen pellets of ~15-20E6 cells were lysed in 8 M urea, 0.1 M Tris pH 8.0, 150

20

mM NaCl and 1X HALT phosphatase/protease inhibitor cocktail (Pierce, 78442)

21

for timecourse experiments or 8 M Guanadine-Cl (Gdn, Chem Impex Intl., 00152-

1KG), 0.1 M Tris pH 8.5, 10 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP, Pierce,

23

20491), 40 mM 2-chloroacetamide (2-CAA, Sigma, 22790-250G-F), 1X HALT for

24

SILAC samples and lysed with probe sonicator (BRANSONIC). In the case of

25

single-timepoint SILAC samples, equal part light and heavy labeled lysate

26

samples were combined (~ 2.5–3 mg total). Lysate is diluted with 0.1 M Tris pH

27

8.0 to a final concentration of 1.3 M Gdn or urea. Proteome is digested with

28

1:100 dilution of trypsin overnight for 22-24 hr at room temperature. Peptides are

29

extracted with SEP-PAK C18 cartridges (WATERS). For single-timepoint SILAC

30

samples, ~100 µg of eluted peptides were dried and analyzed separately by LC-

Affinity Purification

6

For each replicate, frozen cell pellets were gently lysed on ice with 200 µl

7

hypotonic lysis buffer (20 mM Tris (pH 7.4@4°C), 10 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA

8

(Fisher, BP120-500), 0.5% NP-40 alternative (EMD, 492016-100ML), 1 mM DTT

12

clarified with 5 passes through an 18-gauge syringe needle. Lysate was

13

centrifuged at 5,000 rcf, 4°C for 10 min and supernatant was reserved as

14

cytoplasmic fraction, while nuclear fraction was washed and resuspended in 60

15

µl of 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 420 mM NaCl, 25% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM

16

DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 0.03 U/mL aprotinin, 1x protease/phosphatase inhibitor

19

mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA (binding buffer) and combined with M2 anti-FLAG

20

magnetic beads (Sigma, M8823). Bound lysate was washed with binding buffer +

21

0.05% NP-40, then binding buffer, then twice with 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 2 mM

Proteomic data analysis and quantification

6

Initial timecourse unlabeled phosphoproteomics data were processed together

7

on Maxquant v1.5.1.2 (55) and searched against the human proteome (Uniprot

8

downloaded 2014/12/3, with 89,706 entries). All AP-MS samples were processed

9

together with similar settings. All SILAC samples (phospho- and unenriched

10

peptides) were processed together with similar settings. SILAC quantification for

11

global proteomics at the protein level requires 1 minimum razor or unique

12

peptide. A one-sample T-test was applied to the log-2 transform of the

13

normalized SILAC-labeled peptide ratios (heavy:light) for single-timepoint

14

analysis, while for AP-MS data, two-sample T-test was applied to the log-2

15

transform of the median-normalized MaxQuant label-free quantification (LFQ)

16

values of protein groups. The number of total entries (phosphosites, protein

17

groups, significance is p < 0.05, |t-test difference| ≥ 1), along with correlation

18

statistics between replicates, are summarized in Supplementary Table S4 and

19

shown in Fig. S3B. See Supplementary Information for specific search and

20

analysis settings.

22

RNA-seq library preparation

23

RNA was extracted from frozen cell pellets with RNeasy Mini-prep kit (Qiagen,

24

74104). For timecourse experiments, cDNA library of expression transcripts was

25

carried out with RNA Hyper Prep kit with RiboErase (Kapa, KK8560) to enhance

26

transcript reads above ribosomal reads, while single-timepoint experiments

27

assessing splicing required mRNA enrichment with magnetic mRNA Isolation kit

28

poly-dT beads (NEB), then RNA Hyper Prep kit (Kapa, KK8540) for cDNA

29

construction of 200-400 bp library with Illumina platform TruSeq indexed

30

adaptors (Supplementary Table S1). RNA and DNA quantified at all steps by

31

Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific) and cDNA library size and quality were evaluated

JuncBASE alternative splicing analysis

6

Alternative splicing events were identified and quantified with JuncBASE v1.2-

7

beta using default parameters (21). Intron-exon junction database was created

8

from hg19 annotations. T-test was used to compare number of inclusion and

9

exclusion reads and p-values were adjusted with Benjamini-Hochberg correction.

10

For ΔPSI histograms in Fig. 3B-C, 4C-D, and 5A, JuncBASE output included a

11

subset of alternative splice events with median PSI = 0.00 in both conditions or

12

median PSI = 100.00 in both conditions, resulting in ΔPSI = 0.00. These events

13

were manually removed for downstream analyses. Histograms and splicing

14

statistics were determined with statistical computing program R (v3.5.1) and a

15

summary is listed in Supplementary Table S3.

16
17

Gene Ontology enrichment analysis

18

Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of upregulated phosphosites and

19

enriched SRSF1 interactors was performed in STRING (v10.5, https://string-

20

db.org/) (56), searching against a background of all quantified protein entries.

21

Enrichment analysis of all significantly alternative spliced genes (raw p < 0.05)

22

was performed using web-based enrichment analysis tool, Enrichr

23

(http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/) (57). Reported combined score is

24

calculated by multiplying the natural log transform of the p-value with the Fisher’s

25

exact test of expected rank deviation (Z-score). Functional GO analysis is limited

26

to biological processes and compiled in Supplementary Table S5.

studies, and typically weigh 20-25 g. NSG mice were handled with aseptic

2

techniques and housed in pathogen free environments at the UCSF Laboratory

3

Animal Research Center. All mouse studies were performed according to UCSF

4

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-approved protocols. Tumor burden

5

was assessed through weekly bioluminescent imaging in the UCSF preclinical

6

therapeutic core on a Xenogen In Vivo Imaging System (IVIS), beginning 13 days

7

after implantation, which is the same day as treatment initiation. Tumor implanted

8

humanized mice were randomized and sorted into control arm and treatment

9

arm, 6 mice/arm. Mice were treated for two weeks (five days on, two days off)

10

with vehicle or 3 mg/kg E7107, formulated in vehicle (10% Ethanol, 5% Tween-

11

80, QS with Saline) and administered by continuous subcutaneous infusion. Mice

12

were kept and observed until survival endpoint; final timepoint was 54 days after

13

MM.1S transplant. Acquired luciferase intensities were quantified with Living

14

Image Software (PerkinElmer) in units of radiance (photons/s/cm2/sr). Kaplan-

15

meier survival curves along with log-ranked test to determine significance were

16

calculated in GraphPad Prism 6 software.

Patient bone marrow aspirate, CD138 labeling and flow cytometry analysis

19

Fresh de-identified primary multiple myeloma patient bone marrow (BM) samples

20

were obtained from the UCSF Hematologic Malignancies Tissue Bank in

21

accordance with the UCSF Committee on Human Research-approved protocols

22

and the Declaration of Helsinki. Bone marrow mononuclear cells were isolated by

23

density gradient centrifugation with Histopaque-1077 (Sigma Aldrich), and

24

washed with 10 mL D-PBS 3 times. Mononuclear cells were resuspended in a

25

small volume (~1.5 mL) of media (RPMI1640, 10% FBS, 1%

26

penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mM glutamine) and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for

27

15min. Isolated mononuclear cells from multiple myeloma patient bone marrow

28

were adjusted to 2E5 cells/well in a 96 well plate. Cells were stimulated with 50

29

ng/ml recombinant human IL-6 (ProsPec) for 17 hr before treatment with E7107

Statistical Analyses

7

All data are presented as mean +/- standard deviation, unless otherwise stated.

8

Statistical significance in proteomics comparisons was determined by Student’s t-

9

test: One-sample t-test with null hypothesis that log2-transform of the normalized

10

SILAC ratio = 0, or a two-sample T-test with null hypothesis that the difference in

11

log2-transform of the intensities is equal to. A p < 0.05 is considered statistically

12

significant. For all Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, log-ranked test was used to

13

determine statistical significance.
