33

Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. However, under

34

certain conditions, its release into the atmosphere can be mitigated by methane-oxidizing

35

microorganisms. Typically, cultivated wetlands (i.e., paddy fields) are a major source of methane

36

(CH4) while forests and meadow uplands are considered to be CH4 sinks. As the global need for rice

37

production increases each year, more uplands are converted to inundated paddy fields. To investigate

38

soils that may be converted into productive land for rice production, we investigated a paddy field and

39

adjacent meadow in Northern Italy. Using a combination of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to

40

analyze the bacterial community, and gas flux measurements to quantify CH4 emissions, we looked for

41

differences between classically defined CH4 sinks (meadow soils) and CH4 sources (paddy fields).

42

Analysis of the total bacterial community revealed that the family Fimbriimonadaceae, which belongs

43

to the phylum Armatimonadetes, was significantly higher in paddy field soils driving the difference

44

between paddy and meadow soils. Whereas, we found that the methylotrophic families

45

Methyloligellaceae and Methylomirabilaceae were also present in higher relative abundance in the

46

paddy field. Despite these major differences, CH4 fluxes were highly variable between the two sites

47

with no significant differences observed. Furthermore, we found the Methylomonaceae family to be

48

more abundant at the center of a neighboring paddy field compared to the edge of the paddy field from

49

the current study, hinting at methanotrophic variation based on location. Taking these results into

50

account, we propose a conceptual model to explain possible scenarios that may result in paddy and

51

meadow fields not exhibiting classical source/sink properties. These findings call for caution when

52

including paddy and meadow areas separately into global CH4 flux calculations, and urge further

53

research to discern drivers of CH4 cycling under a range of environmental conditions rather than

54

relying on assumptions.

Introduction

57

One of the most abundant greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere is methane (CH4), with

58

its concentration steadily increasing as a result of anthropogenic activities (Wahlen, 1993; Dean et al.,

59

2018). Approximately 40% of the sources of atmospheric CH4 are represented by natural and

60

cultivated wetlands. In order to meet the global need for food, additional land is being converted into

61

cultivated wetlands including inundated paddy soils. This has resulted in an increase in their total area

62

by approximately 1% annually (IPCC, 2013; Pearman, 1986; Dlugokencky et al., 1994). Heavily

63

fertilized fields for rice production are considered to be among the highest sources of CH4 emission on

64

the planet (Lowe, 2006). The expansion of rice production in combination with increasing global

65

temperatures could exacerbate CH4 emissions from these source environments (Aselmann & Crutzen,

66

1989; Conrad, 2009). Understanding the potential factors that control CH4 emissions from upland and

67

wetland environments is necessary to accurately predict future atmospheric concentrations of CH4.

68

In wetlands, CH4 emission to the atmosphere results from a greater production of CH4 by

69

methanogenic microorganisms than what is oxidized by methanotrophic microorganisms (Cao et al.,

70

1998). Although some CH4 in paddy soils can be oxidized under anoxic conditions at the expense of

71

nitrate by Methanoperedens archaea (Vaksmaa et al., 2016; Welte et al., 2016 ), most methane seems

72

to be oxidized by aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) (Lüke et al., 2010). Known MOB

73

belong to the Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and NC10 phyla (Hanson & Hanson, 1996; Wu et al.,

74

2011; Op den Camp et al., 2009). Within the Proteobacteria, methanotrophs are further classified into

75

two main types known as type I and type II (Hanson and Hanson, 1996). Type I methanotrophs are

76

affiliated with the Gammaproteobacteria and assimilate carbon via the ribulose monophosphate

77

(RuMP) pathway, while type II belong to the Alphaproteobacteria and utilize the serine pathway for

78

carbon fixation. These two types of MOB were shown to be the dominant methanotrophs in paddy

79

fields, with their growth and activity influenced by soil conditions (i.e., organic content, pH,

80

temperature), fertilizer application and vegetation cover (Hanson and Hanson, 1996; Zheng et al.,

81

2008).

82

Although previous studies have focused on the effect of various agricultural practices, climate change

83

and soil features on methanotrophs, most have only included a wetland (i.e. methane source; for

84

references refer to supplementary table S2) or an upland (i.e. methane sink; for references refer to

85

supplementary table S2). Only few included both environments in their experimental design (Skov et

86

al., 2017; Hondula and Palmer, 2017). This has left the literature split between what main factors are

87

influencing methanotrophic community structure within these environments. Therefore, it is important

88

to further investigate differences in the microbial community and CH4 fluxes of these two

89

environments to better understand the contributions to methane emissions and global climate change.

90

In this study, we investigated the bacterial community from a paddy field and an adjacent meadow by

91

16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. In order to identify any influence soil cultivation has induced

92

on the soil bacterial community, we compared the bacterial community, with special interest in the

93

methanotrophic community, paired with CH4 fluxes from a neighboring meadow. We observed that

94

the paddy field and the meadow had distinct bacterial communities being driven by the families

95

Fimbriimonadaceae and Methyloligellaceae along with other methanotrophic groups, although the

96

CH4 fluxes did not differ significantly between the classical CH4 source (paddy field) and sink

97

(meadow) soils and were found to be highly variable across both environments. By combining the

98

findings of this study with previous literature, we propose a conceptual model that provides several

99

explanatory scenarios for these soils not exhibiting behaviors assumed to be universal to paddy and

100

meadow soils.

Materials and Methods

103

Study site

104

Field experiments took place at the rice research facility Vercelli, Italy (45°19'25.6"N

105

8°22'14.2"E). This field has been under rice cultivation with the rice variety Oryza sativa temperate

106

japonica Onice for the last 30 years, with irrigation waters coming from the river Sesia during the

107

growing season (May – September) and fields left fallow during the winter months. Sample

108

acquisition took place during the maturing stage of the rice plants. The neighboring meadow has been

109

left uncultivated for the last 30 years, contains sandy soil, and is covered with grass and small bushes.

110

Data obtained from the study by Vaksmaa and colleagues (08°22 25.89 E; 45°19 26.98 N) is from a

111

neighboring paddy field that has gone through the same farming practices and planted with the same

112

rice cultivar, Oryza sativa.

114

Soil-atmosphere CH4 exchange was determined using a static chamber approach (Livingston

115

et al. 2005) in July 2015 from the rice paddy field and meadow at the Italian Rice Research Unit in

116

Vercelli, Italy. Measurements were made by using a 10 L volume PVC cylindrical flux chamber,

117

covered with a gas tight lid. Chambers were fitted with small computer fans to promote even air

118

mixing (Pumpanen et al., 2004) and a small vent to prevent pressure changes inside the chamber as air

119

was extracted (Hutchinson & Livingston, 2001). Temperature was measured by fitting a temperature

120

probe in a small hole made at the top of the chamber. At the time of sampling, six chambers were

121

placed carefully on the ground, where an airtight seal was created due to the permanently standing

122

water. On the meadow site, where there was no water, a gas tight seal was created by fixing a rubber

123

skirt to the bottom of the chambers. The headspace samples were collected from each flux chamber at

124

five intervals over a 35-minute enclosure period using a gas tight syringe and 1 meter of tygon tubing,

125

in order to prevent disturbance while sampling. Gas samples were stored in pre-evacuated Exetainers®

126

(Labco Ltd., Lampeter, UK), shipped to the University of Aberdeen, UK and subsequently analyzed

127

for CH4 concentrations using an Agilent 6890 series gas chromatography system, with a single flame

128

ionization detector (FID) for CH4. Repeated analysis of standards determined that instrumental

129

precision error was <10%.

130

Flux rates were determined using the HMR package (Pedersen et al., 2010) in R 3.0.2 (R Core Team

131

2012) by plotting the best-fit lines to the data for headspace concentration (ppm) against time

132

(minutes) for individual flux chambers. The Ideal Gas Law was used to convert gas concentrations

133

(ppm) to molar concentrations. Fluxes were then reported in mg CH4-C m−2 hr−1. Soil temperature (at

134

10 cm) was simultaneously measured in three locations adjacent to the chambers using a type K

135

thermacouple (Hanna Instruments Ltd., UK).

136

Sample acquisition and DNA Isolation:

137

A total of 21 soil samples were collected near the edge of the paddy field that is neighboring a

138

meadow separated by a ditch located in the described study site. As seen in the sampling diagram

139

(Figure S1), a total of 6 sites at the edge of the paddy field were used for samples to be collected using

140

a 10 cm metallic core with a diameter of 8 cm. Samples were taken at three, six and nine meters from

141

the meadow. Each row of samples was also three meters apart. To exclude rhizospheric soil, each

142

sample site was chosen carefully to be equally distant from all neighboring rice plants, and contain no

143

visible root material from the plants. The soil slurry from the cores was then mixed thoroughly and

144

transferred to 50 mL falcon tubes. Lastly, 15 sampling sites within the meadow were used as described

145

in figure S1. The samples were taken at three, six and nine meters away from the paddy field by using

146

a 50mL falcon tube containing the top 7cm of the dry soil. Each row of samples within the meadow

147

was also three meters apart. Soil surface was cleared before sampling to only include bulk soil. All

148

paddy and meadow samples were stored at -20 °C for further analysis. Bulk soil cores obtained by

149

Vaksmaa and colleagues from the center of a neighboring paddy field were done using an 80-cm soil

150

augers at 5-m intervals (Vaksmaa et al., 2017). The cores were later divided up at each 5-cm depth,

151

however, we only compared the data obtained from the top 10-cm.

152

DNA from all samples was extracted using the MO BIO Power soil isolation kit following the

153

manufacturer’s protocol (MO BIO Laboratories, USA) with one modification. In the mechanical cell

154

lysis step, the soil samples were beaten with glass beads at 30 s-1 frequency for 1 minute using a MO

155

BIO 96 well plate shaker. The quality and quantity of the DNA was checked using gel electrophoresis

156

and spectrophotometric analysis (NanoDrop 1000, Thermo Scientific, USA).

157

16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing:

158

A two-step PCR protocol adapted from Klindworth et al., 2012 and Berry et al., 2012 was

159

used to amplify bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences using the universal bacterial primers B341f and

160

B785r. The PCR program started an initial denaturation step at 98°C for 10 minutes, followed by 25

161

cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 1 minute, annealing at 60°C for 1 minute, extension at 72°C for 2

162

minutes, followed by a final extension step at 72°C for 10 minutes. The PCR products were purified

163

using QIAquick PCR product purification kit following manufacturer’s protocol (Qiagen Inc.,

164

Germany). Per sample, a total of six PCR reactions were performed. All samples were checked for

165

quality and quantity with gel electrophoresis and fluorescence-based analysis (Qubit 2.0, Thermo

166

Fisher Scientific, USA) before being used in a second PCR step with barcoded B341 forward primer

167

and reverse B785 primer containing the P1 adapter. The PCR conditions were as described above, but

168

only 10 cycles were performed. Subsequently, all parallel reactions were pooled, purified and checked

169

for quality again as described above. Each pooled sample was then further analyzed for quality and

170

quantity in the last step using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) following the manufacturer’s

171

protocol and sequenced on the Ion Torrent PGM (Thermo Fischer Scientific).

172

Bioinformatic analysis:

173

Raw reads from the Ion Torrent run were analyzed using mothur (Schloss et al., 2009). The

174

workflow consisted of eight steps: file processing, quality-based trimming, alignment based

175

processing, pre-clustering, chimera removal, contamination removal, OTU clustering and generation

176

of OTU files. The quality-based trimming step was done with parameters set as follows: PDIFF = 2,

177

MAXHOMOP= 8, MAXAMBIG – 0, QWINDOWAVERAGE =20, QWINDOWSIZE = 50,

178

MINLENGTH = 200 and MAXLENGTH = 450. In the alignment based processing step, the Silva

179

database (v132) (Quast et al., 2012) was used for the DB_ALIGN and DB_TAX function with these

184

185

repeated with the addition of Ion Torrent raw reads from the study published by Vaksmaa and

186

colleagues (2017). In order to normalize for the different sequencing depths between the two data sets,

187

the samples were subjected to a random subsampling at a depth of 10,000 reads. All OTUs with

was normalized to relative abundances for all analysis. Analyses were performed with the R package

194

vegan (Oksanen et al., 2015). Shannon diversity was calculated using the diversity function and Bray-

195

Curtis dissimilarity matrices were generated with vegdist. Chao1 estimates were performed using the

196

chao1 function from the rareNMtests package (Cayuela and Gotelli, 2014). Permutational multivariate

197

analyses of variance (PERMANOVA) were performed using the adonis2 function and classic

198

multidimensional scaling was performed using cmdscale. The main drivers of differences in the

199

microbial community composition between paddy field and meadow samples were identified using a

Results

203

CH4 fluxes and Bacterial community structure and composition

204

The mean CH4 flux from the paddy field (0.67 ± 1.76 mg C m-2 hr-2) and meadow (-0.65 ±

205

1.59 mg C m-2 hr-2) did not statistically differ from one another (t = -1.23; p = 0.251; Figure 1). 16S

206

rRNA amplicon sequencing yielded a total of 958,089 reads. On average, each sample contained

207

12,898 ± 17,506 reads (Table S1). No significant differences were observed between paddy and

208

meadow samples for either species richness (Chao1; t = -0.59; p = 0.574; mean in meadow = 3673

209

species; mean in paddy = 4260 species) or the sampling depth (t = -0.43, p = 0.67; mean in meadow =

210

10,179 reads, mean in paddy = 15,342 reads). However, the composition of the total microbial

211

community in paddy and meadow soils significantly differed (PERMAnova; F = 2.27, p = 0.03; Figure

212

2A). A random forest classifier was used to identify the main bacterial family driving the difference

213

between paddy and meadow soils which was the Fimbriimonadaceae that belongs to the phylum

214

Armatimonadetes (formerly OP10; Figure 2B). Fimbriimonadaceae was significantly more abundant in

215

paddy field soils compared to meadow soils (Figure 2B; t = -4.16; p = 0.001). Furthermore, the

216

bacterial community at the family level was found to be more diverse in the paddy field compared to

217

the meadow (Shannon diversity (H’); t = -3.28; p = 0.005; mean meadow = 3.39; mean paddy field =

218

3.89; Figure 3).

219

Methylotrophic community

220

A total of 599 OTUs in the dataset were classified as methanotrophs originating from the

221

Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and NC10 phyla. The composition of methanotrophic community

222

differed significantly between the paddy and the meadow soils (PERMAnova; F = 2.63, p = 0.041;

223

Figure 4A). The most abundant methylotroph was affiliated with the family Methyloligellaceae and

224

made up on average 21% of the methylotrophic community. Members of the families

225

Methyloligellaceae and Methylomirabilaceae, were the top two drivers distinguishing the

226

methylotrophic community between meadow and paddy field soils (Figure 4B-C). In general, all

227

methanotroph family abundances were higher in paddy field soils compared to meadow (Figure 5; t =

228

2.53; p = 0.039).

229

Spatial variation of Methanotrophs between paddy fields

230

In order to examine whether any large-scale spatial variation exists in the methanotrophic

231

community, we compared the data obtained from this study (edge of the paddy field) to the data

232

published by Vaksmaa and colleagues, which were obtained from samples taken from the center of a

233

neighboring paddy field (Vaksmaa et al., 2017). The methanotrophic community in the center of the

234

paddy field more closely resembled the community at the edge of the paddy field than the meadow,

235

however there were differences within the methanotrophic community (Figure 6A; F = 3.91; p =

236

0.006). Members of Methylomonaceae family were significantly more abundant at the center of the

237

neighboring paddy field (Figure 6B;t = 5.24; p = 0.0001). In addition, the Methylomonaceae family

238

was found to be the main driver of the differences observed between the two methanotrophic

239

community between the two locations (Figure 6C).

Discussion

242

The objective of this study was to survey differences in the microbial communities and more

243

specifically the methanotrophic bacteria between a cultivated wetland and an adjacent upland meadow

244

soil, conventionally recognized as strong sources and sinks of CH4, respectively. Despite the

245

traditional classification, we observed that the rice paddy field and its neighboring meadow used here

246

are highly variable in their CH4 fluxes (Figure 1). This, however, is a single time point and not a

247

representative of possible seasonal fluxes from these fields. It has been reported that during the

248

flooding period of the paddy field, in which no plants are sown, CH4 is almost exclusively emitted into

249

the atmosphere through ebullition with fluxes as high as 27.73 mg·g-2·h-1 (Yuan et al., 2018;

250

Holzapfel‐Pschorn & Seiler, 1986). After rice cultivation, up to 90% of the observed CH4 emissions

251

into the atmosphere are due to diffusion through aerenchyma of the plants. In this study, CH4 fluxes

252

and samples were measured from the bulk soil of the paddy field to avoid any possible affect from rice

253

plant or roots on the microbial community or flux data. This could potentially explain the relatively

254

low CH4 fluxes observed from the paddy as most of the CH4 at the time of sampling would be emitted

255

through the aerenchyma of the rice plants. Additionally, it has been reported that soil amendment by

256

organic fertilization increases the availability of C substrates to methanogens and increases CH4

257

production (Yuan et al., 2018; Plaza-Bonilla et al., 2014; Mohanty et al., 2006). This effect, however,

258

is not observed from the bulk soil in the current study. Furthermore, the paddy field was found to be

259

low in C content (1.4 ± 0.1 %), which would be an indication of low substrate availability for

260

microbial activities. CH4 emissions from bulk soil during the maturing stage of rice growth, which is

261

the stage in which the fluxes were measured in this study, are reported to be below 2 mg·g-2·h-1 (Yuan

262

et al., 2018; Vaskmaa et al., 2016).

263

Despite CH4 fluxes being similar between the two sites, we found significant differences in the total

264

bacterial communities’ structure. Since the paddy field is plowed, fertilized and planted homogenously

265

with rice, we hypothesized for the total bacterial composition to be established in a more homogenous

266

manner relative to the meadow. What we found was that the total bacterial community was different

267

from its neighboring meadow with high bacterial heterogeneity observed in both environments (i.e.,

268

highly variable; Figure 2A). Despite the variability, we found that the main family driving the

269

difference between the two soils was Fimbriimonadaceae within the Armatimonadetes phylum (Figure

270

2B). Sequences classified as Armatimonadetes have been obtained by culture-independent methods

271

from various environments including aerobic and anaerobic wastewater treatment processes,

272

hypersaline microbial mats and subsurface geothermal water streams, as well as various rhizospheres

273

(Portillo and Gonzalez 2009; Lee et al., 2011; Tamaki et al., 2011). The recently isolated

274

Fimbriimonas ginsengisoli within the Fimbriimonadia class was described as strictly aerobic, Gram-

275

negative, meso- and neutrophilic strain with the ability to grow on peptone, casamino acids and yeast

276

extract (Im et al., 2012). In another study, genera affiliated with the Fimbriimonadaceae grew better in

277

biofilms cultured using a flow incubator with supplied inorganic nitrogen (N) conditions compared to

278

deficient N (Li et al., 2017). Since the paddy field more similarly resembles an N condition, it could

279

explain Fimbriimonadaceae’s higher abundance compared to the meadow and moreover, the higher

280

diversity of microbial community observed in the paddy field (Figure 3). However, any role that this

281

family of Armatimonadetes would play in paddy soil N cycling requires further investigation.

282

Previous research on paddy fields in Vercelli have shown that MOB communities, even in very closely

283

located fields with nearly identical agricultural treatments show significantly different patterns (Ho et

284

al., 2011, Lüke et al., 2010). This difference in the MOB community was assumed to be a

285

consequence of variance in CH4 fluxes (Smith et al., 2016; Yuan et al., 2014; Holzapfel‐Pschorn &

286

Seiler, 1986). However, difference in CH4 fluxes could not account for the observations made in this

287

study, particularly regarding the differences observed in the methylotrophic community in the current

288

study (Figure 4A). Furthermore, the most abundant methylotrophs in the paddy field were classified as

289

members of the proposed family “Methyloligellaceae” within the Rhizobiales order (Figure 4B) and

290

Methylomirabilaceae family (Figure 4C).

291

To date, two separate isolates have been cultivated from Ural saline environments classified as

292

Methyloligella halotolerans gen. nov., sp. nov. and Methyloligella solikamskensis sp. nov. (Doronina

293

et al., 2013). These obligate methylotrophic isolates within the Rhizobiales order are strictly aerobic,

294

Gram negative, non-motile rods that utilize the serine pathway for carbon assimilation. Although

295

environmental sequences belonging to the Methyloligellaceae family have been previously found in

296

agricultural soil (Ceja-Navarro et al., 2010), not much is known about the role these

297

alphaproteobacterial methylotrophs play in this environment. Fertilizer application has been shown to

298

have an inhibitory effect on type II methanotrophs in rice fields, while stimulating type I MOB

299

(Mohanty et al., 2006). In the current study, we found the Methyloligellaceae family were more

300

abundant in the paddy field compared to the meadow. Without information about their genetics or

301

physiology, it is challenging to infer their possible role in carbon (C) cycling within the paddy field.

302

However, being the most abundant OTU in our data set by an order of magnitude, it is likely that

303

members of this group are key players in this paddy field.

304

Studies that investigated the presence of methanotrophs in cultivated wetlands have reported the

305

presence of both type I and type II Methylocaldum-like and Methyocystis-like pmoA genes in high

306

abundance (Collet et al., 2015; Zheng et al, 2008; Asakawa et al., 2008). Therefore, we expected the

307

methanotrophic community to be present in higher abundance in the paddy field compared to the

308

meadow (Figure 5). However, we did not find any classical type II methanotrophs (Methylocystis- and

309

Methylosinus-like) reported to be present in high abundance in cultivated wetlands (Lüke et al., 2010;

310

Zheng et al., 2008; Shrestha et al., 2008). Although multiple factors are in play, an enriched MOB

311

community within the paddy field could be a result of higher indigenous CH4 available as substrate

312

when compared to the meadow. This would in turn result in higher rates of CH4 oxidation and overall,

313

a higher relative abundance of methanotrophs. In future research, it would be critical to monitor the

314

changes in the MOB community structure during the conversion of a meadow into a paddy field to see

315

what fluctuations occur in the MOB community after a drastic change in the cultivation regiment.

316

Lastly, due to the highly variable CH4 fluxes throughout the paddy field, we wanted to investigate if

317

sampling location influenced the abundance of methanotrophs. Previous studies on the spatial

318

variation of methane fluxes within paddy fields have demonstrated that fluxes can vary significantly

319

even within the same field, thus making extrapolation to larger areas from point samples challenging

320

(Oo et al., 2015; Sass et al., 2002; Krause et al., 2009; Spokas et al., 2013). In order to compare the

321

community composition of methanotrophs between two neighboring paddy fields, we incorporated the

322

data published by Vaksmaa and colleagues into our analyses (Vaskmaa et al., 2017; Figure 6A-C). We

323

found that while the methanotrophic community from the Vaskmaa et al. study resembled that of our

324

paddy soil samples, there was a significant difference in relative abundance of certain methanotrophic

13

325

families between the two sampling locations (Figure 6A-B). More specifically, members of the

326

Methylomonaceae family were found in much higher relative abundance in the previous study (Figure

327

6B) and were found to be the main family, driving the differences observed between the two data sets

328

(Figure 6C). Unfortunately, there is no CH4 flux data available to compare between the two study sites

329

and whether more indigenous CH4 availability is the reason behind this difference. Regardless, this

330

finding suggests that the methanotrophic community may be heterogeneously distributed across

331

neighboring paddy fields, possibly resulting in differences in CH4 oxidation capabilities. As indicated

332

by others, designing a strong experiment which pairs soil samples for microbial community analysis,

333

in situ measurements of important environmental factors (i.e., pore water pH, inorganic compound

334

concentrations, etc) with CH4 flux data may reveal drivers of the heterogeneity of the paddy field

335

methanotrophic community (Hester et al., 2018).

337

Conclusion

338

Typically, paddy fields are regarded as CH4 sources. These CH4 emissions stem from a

339

combination of higher fertilizer inputs, which result in increased organic matter deposited by the rice

340

plant into the rhizosphere, providing substrate for methanogenesis (i.e., higher methanogenic activity).

341

In the current study, we find that the paddy field on average was a source (positive CH4 fluxes) and the

342

meadow a sink (negative CH4 fluxes), though there was no statistically significant difference between

343

the two locations due to the high variability of the flux measurements. Based on the data collected and

344

previous studies, we propose two possible working hypotheses responsible for the observations made

345

by this study (Figure 7). The observed low levels of CH4 emissions in the paddy field could be due to

346

high turnover rates of CH4. This is indicated by the high relative abundance of the MOB community

347

comprised mainly of type II methanotrophs affiliated with the Methyloligellaceae family, and

348

complies with previous studies (Barbosa et al., 2018; Yuan et al., 2018). Alternatively, the low flux

349

could stem from a lower initial CH4 production within the soil due to decreased various root exudates,

350

a lower redox potential, or the provision of methanogenic substrates by heterotrophic bacteria (Mayer

351

& Conrad, 1990; Aulakh et al., 2001). Consequently, due to the high variability within and between

352

wetland and upland soils, caution should be exercised when making extrapolated predictions of CH4

353

emissions.
