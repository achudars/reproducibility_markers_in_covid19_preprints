Abstract

14	  

Serotonin (5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine) and other neuromodulators tune circuit activity to

15	  

impart behavioral flexibility and adaptation. We demonstrate that Drosophila optic lobe neurons

16	  

involved in the initial steps of visual processing are subject to serotonergic neuromodulation.

17	  

The visual processing neurons L2 and T1 express 5-HT2B and 5-HT1-type receptors,

18	  

respectively. Serotonin increases calcium in L2, but not T1 neurons, and serotonin potentiates

19	  

the L2 neuron response to luminance increases. While we did not detect serotonin receptor

20	  

expression in L1 neurons, they also undergo serotonin-induced calcium changes, likely through

21	  

electrical coupling between L1 and L2 neurons. We also found that L2 and T1 form reciprocal

22	  

synapses onto serotonergic projections in the medulla, forming a potential feedback loop.

23	  

Together, these results describe a serotonergic microcircuit for regulating the first steps of visual

24	  

processing in Drosophila.

Introduction

26	  

Behavioral flexibility requires dynamic changes in neural circuit function, which is often

27	  

achieved by aminergic or peptidergic neuromodulatory signaling (Katz, 1999; Kupfermann,

28	  

1979; Marder, 2012; Marder et al., 2014; Nadim et al., 2014). Neuromodulators alter the

29	  

biophysical and synaptic properties of individual neurons and circuits to shape behavior and to

30	  

meet the animal’s changing needs (Katz, 1999; Kupfermann, 1979; Marder, 2012; Marder et al.,

31	  

2014; Nadim et al., 2014). Serotonin acts a neuromodulator in a variety of circuits including the

32	  

sensory systems required for olfaction, hearing, and vision (Andres et al., 2016; Arechiga et al.,

33	  

1990; Brunert et al., 2016; Dacks et al., 2008; Fotowat et al., 2016; Kloppenburg et al., 1999;

34	  

Lottem et al., 2016; Moreau et al., 2010; Papesh et al., 2016; Petzold et al., 2009; Seillier et al.,

35	  

2017; Watakabe et al., 2009). In the mammalian visual cortex, serotonin regulates the balance

36	  

of excitation and inhibition (Moreau et al., 2010), cellular plasticity (Gagolewicz et al., 2016; Gu

37	  

et al., 1995; Lombaert et al., 2018; Wang et al., 1997), and response gain (Seillier et al., 2017;

38	  

Shimegi et al., 2016). In the mammalian retina, serotonin signaling reduces GABAergic

39	  

amacrine cell input to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) via 5-HT1A (Zhou et al., 2018) and can

40	  

modulate the response of RGCs to visual stimuli (Trakhtenberg et al., 2017). Multiple serotonin

41	  

receptor subtypes are expressed in visual and other sensory systems; however, the manner in

42	  

which serotonin receptor activation is integrated into sensory circuits to regulate information

43	  

processing remains poorly understood.

44	  

The visual system of Drosophila melanogaster provides a powerful genetic model to

45	  

study the mechanisms underlying visual circuit activity and regulation (Borst et al., 2015). In

46	  

Drosophila, visual processing begins in the lamina where intrinsic monopolar neurons L1, L2,

47	  

and L3 receive direct input from photoreceptors (Meinertzhagen et al., 1991). L1 and L2

48	  

neurons are first-order neurons that feed into pathways discriminating light “ON” (i.e., increase

49	  

in luminance) and light “OFF” (i.e., decrease in luminance) stimuli respectively (Joesch et al.,

50	  

2010; Strother et al., 2014). L1 and L2 neurons respond in a physiologically identical manner to

51	  

changes in luminance (Clark et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2016; Zheng et al., 2006), while

52	  

downstream neurons in the medulla transform this information to discriminate ON versus OFF

53	  

stimuli (Strother et al., 2014). Further processing occurs in the lobula and lobula plate to

54	  

mediate higher-order computations for both motion and contrast detection (Bahl et al., 2015;

55	  

Behnia et al., 2015; Strother et al., 2014).

56	  

Serotonergic neurons broadly innervate the optic ganglia of Drosophila and other

57	  

insects, including the lamina, medulla, lobula, and lobula plate (Hamanaka et al., 2012; Leitinger

58	  

et al., 1999; Nässel et al., 1985; Nässel et al., 1987; Schafer et al., 1986; Valles et al., 1988).

59	  

Significant progress has been made in mapping the synaptic connectivity of the optic lobe,

60	  

including neurons required for motion detection (Meinertzhagen et al., 1991; Rivera-Alba et al.,

61	  

2011; Shinomiya et al., 2019; Takemura et al., 2013; Takemura et al., 2008; Takemura et al.,

62	  

2017; Takemura et al., 2015). By contrast, the connectivity of serotoninergic projections in the

63	  

optic lobe and the mechanisms by which serotonergic signaling may regulate visual processing

64	  

in flies or other insects remains unclear.

65	  

Here, we leverage Drosophila molecular-genetic tools to identify the expression patterns

66	  

of serotonin receptors present in a subset of critical visual processing lamina neurons and the

67	  

connectivity of these cells. We demonstrate that serotonin signaling increases intracellular

68	  

calcium and enhances stimulus-response in L2 neurons, establishing a potential mechanism for

69	  

serotonergic regulation of the initial events required for visual processing.

Results

73	  

Serotoninergic circuitry in the optic lobe

74	  

Five genes encoding serotonin receptors have been identified in the Drosophila genome:

75	  

5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B and 5-HT7 (Colas et al., 1995; Gasque et al., 2013; Saudou

76	  

et al., 1992; Witz et al., 1990). To identify specific neurons in the optic lobes expressing each

77	  

receptor, we expressed the marker mCD8::GFP in flies under the control of a recently

78	  

characterized panel of GAL4 insertions in Minos-mediated Integration Cassettes (MiMICs) (Diao

79	  

et al., 2015; Gnerer et al., 2015). MiMICS are contained within receptor-encoding genes and

80	  

“mimic” their endogenous expression patterns (Venken et al., 2011). We observed distinct

81	  

expression patterns for each receptor throughout the optic lobes (Figure 1), however we

82	  

focused on expression in the lamina, the first optic ganglion and a region crucial for early visual

83	  

processing. In particular, 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B and 5-HT2B receptor subtypes showed prominent

84	  

expression in the lamina (Figure 1A-C) and we therefore concentrate on these receptor

85	  

subtypes. Both 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B GFP-positive neurons innervated the lamina neuropil. We

86	  

did not detect expression of either receptor in cell bodies of the lamina cortex, but rather

87	  

observed GFP-labeled somata at the edge of the medulla (Figure 1A, B). 5-HT2B driven

88	  

expression was prominent in lamina cortex cell bodies as well as in the lamina and medulla

89	  

neuropil (Figure 1C). For 5-HT1B, additional pleomorphic labeling was observed in the lamina

90	  

cortex (arrowhead in Figure 1B) in a pattern that appeared similar to that of optic lobe glia

91	  

(Edwards et al., 2010). We focus here on serotonin receptor expression in lamina neurons

92	  

rather than glia.

93	  

Serotonin immunolabeling was observed in processes within all optic ganglia as well as

94	  

a cluster of 8-10 cell bodies in the accessory medulla (Figure 1D, G). The cell bodies

95	  

correspond to cluster LP2 (or Cb1), previously shown to project into the medulla (Nässel, 1988;

96	  

Valles et al., 1988; Xu et al., 2016). Many of the neuronal processes expressing serotonin

receptor MiMIC-GAL4 driven GFP showed close apposition to serotonergic boutons (Figure 1D-

receptor MiMIC-GAL4 lines in combination with the sparse labeling technique MultiColor FlpOut

129	  

(MCFO-1) (Nern et al., 2015). In 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B sparse-labeling experiments we

130	  

consistently observed cells with a soma in the medulla cortex, a long basket-like projection in

131	  

the lamina, and a smaller projection in the medulla. This morphology is consistent with that of

labeled cells with a soma in the lamina cortex, dense projections extending into the lamina

135	  

the lamina monopolar neuron L2 (Figure 2G) (Fischbach et al., 1989).

relative to other GFP-negative cells from the optic lobe (H-J, top panels). End-point PCR from a

To independently confirm expression of 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B in T1 neurons, and 5-HT2B

161	  

in L2 neurons, we used split-GAL4 drivers specific for each cell type to express GFP (Tuthill et

162	  

al., 2013). GFP-labeled cells were isolated via Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) and

163	  

RT-qPCR was performed on isolates from either T1 or L2 cells to probe for serotonin receptor

164	  

expression. Consistent with our MCFO-1 data, RT-qPCR from GFP-labeled T1 isolates showed

165	  

enrichment of both 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B transcripts, but not other serotonin receptors (Figure

166	  

2H and Supplemental Table 1).

167	  

In contrast to T1, L2 isolates showed consistent enrichment for 5-HT2B, but not 5-HT1A

168	  

or 5-HT1B transcripts (Figure 2I and Supplemental Table 1). Additional receptors were

169	  

occasionally detected in the L2 samples: 5-HT7 was amplified in 3 out of 5 samples and 5-HT2A

170	  

in a single sample (Figure 2I and Supplemental Table 1). It is possible that these transcripts

171	  

were derived from neurons incompletely dissociated from L2 prior to FACS. Alternatively,

172	  

expression of some serotonin receptors may occur in L2 in a mosaic pattern too sparse to be

173	  

easily detected using single cell labeling methods such as MCFO-1.

174	  

We did not observe evidence of any serotonin receptor expression in L1 neurons using

175	  

the serotonin receptor MiMIC-GAL4 lines to drive either mCD8::GFP or MCFO-1 (see Figure 1).

176	  

In agreement with this observation, RT-qPCR from isolated L1 cells showed virtually no receptor

177	  

expression, apart from one sample weakly enriched for 5-HT1B (Figure 2J and Supplemental

178	  

Table 1). In sum, MCFO-1 sparse labeling in combination with RT-qPCR show that T1 neurons

179	  

express 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B, L2 neurons express 5-HT2B, and L1 neurons do not detectably

180	  

express any serotonin receptor subtypes. These data are consistent with a recent computational

181	  

genomics study, which reported a high probability of expression for 5-HT2B in L2, 5-HT1A and

182	  

5-HT1B in T1, and a low likelihood of any serotonin receptor expression in L1 neurons (Davis et

183	  

al., 2018).

184	  

Serotonin increases calcium levels in L2 and L1 neurons

185	  

To determine the potential effects of serotonin on lamina neurons expressing serotonin

186	  

receptors, we bath applied serotonin and used GCaMP6f to monitor cytosolic calcium levels. 5-

187	  

HT2B receptors couple with Gq/11 and increase intracellular calcium in vitro (Blenau et al., 2017;

188	  

Hoyer et al., 2002). To test whether serotonin could have similar effects in 5-HT2B-expressing

189	  

L2 neurons, we used the L2 split-GAL4 driver to express GCaMP6f (Figure 3A). After recording

190	  

a baseline in saline, the perfusion solution was switched to either saline containing 100 µM

191	  

serotonin or saline alone. Tetrodotoxin (TTX) was included in all perfusion solutions to inhibit

192	  

synaptic input from other cells. We consistently observed a large increase in L2>GCaMP6f

193	  

fluorescence following serotonin application (Figure 3B and Supplemental Figure S1A). This

194	  

increase continued throughout the time course of recording, peaking at 1.73 ΔF/F ± 0.77 SEM

195	  

(compared to saline control -0.03 ΔF/F ± 0.05 SEM at the same timepoint; p=0.0095). Thus,

196	  

serotonin leads to an accumulation of cytosolic calcium in L2 cells, consistent with the predicted

197	  

outcome of activating Gq/11 coupled 5-HT2B receptors (Blenau et al., 2017; Hoyer et al., 2002).

shown; traces represent data recorded following a switch at time 0 to saline with serotonin or
saline alone. The length of time for the switch to complete was roughly 1min 45s. In L2
terminals (B), serotonin application led to a significant increase in GCaMP6f signal indicating
increased calcium levels as compared to saline controls (p = 00095). L1 terminals (C) showed a
similar increase in calcium following a switch to serotonin (p = 0.02). (D) RT-qPCR from cell

individual flies; the dark trace is an average of all traces and the shaded region is 1 SD. For (D),
n = 3 individual isolates for each cell type. Bars in (D) represent the mean ± SEM.

228	  
229	  

We did not detect serotonin receptors in L1 neurons and therefore we did not expect

230	  

serotonin to measurably change cytosolic calcium in these neurons. However, when GCaMP6f

231	  

was expressed in L1 cells, we regularly observed a robust increase in baseline fluorescence

232	  

following serotonin exposure with a similar latency to L2 (Figure 3C and S1B). Although the

233	  

increase in GCaMP6f signal did not reach the same response amplitude as observed in L2

234	  

neurons, the effect in L1 neurons similarly persisted throughout the time of recording and

235	  

peaked at 0.98 ΔF/F ± 0.34 SEM (compared to saline control at 0.07 ΔF/F ± 0.09 SEM; p=0.02).

236	  

As the experiments were performed in the presence of TTX, the serotonin response in L1 is

237	  

unlikely to be a result of synaptic input; a direct action of serotonin on L1 is also unlikely due to

238	  

the absence of endogenous serotonin receptors. We therefore hypothesized that electrical

239	  

coupling between L1 and L2 could account for the observed effect of serotonin in L1 (Joesch et

240	  

al., 2010). In support of this possibility, we found that transcripts for the gap junction protein

241	  

Shaking-B (ShakB) were enriched in L1 and L2 neurons, but not T1 neurons (Figure 3D).

242	  

We next examined whether serotonin could affect the activity of T1 cells. Both 5-HT1A

243	  

and 5-HT1B receptors, expressed in T1 neurons, are expected to couple with Gi proteins and

244	  

negatively regulate adenylyl cyclase (Hoyer et al., 2002; Saudou et al., 1992). Due to the

245	  

generally inhibitory function of these receptors, we hypothesized that serotonin would dampen

246	  

activity in T1 neurons, possibly manifested as a decrease in cytosolic calcium. Using the T1

247	  

split-GAL4 driver to express GCaMP6f, however, we did not observe a significant change in

248	  

fluorescence comparable to that seen in L2 or L1 neurons (Figure 3E). Importantly, the absence

249	  

of a GCaMP6f response in T1 neurons indicates that the response observed in L1 and L2 is not

250	  

a generalized phenomenon common to all cells in the lamina.

251	  

As 5-HT1A receptor activation can lead to hyperpolarization in neurons through

252	  

regulation of potassium channels (Polter et al., 2010), we also examined whether a voltage

253	  

sensor could identify baseline changes in T1 cells following serotonin application. However, we

254	  

did not observe any significant serotonin-evoked change in fluorescence using the voltage

255	  

sensor ArcLight (Cao et al., 2013) expressed in T1 cells (Figure 3F and S1D; p>0.1) and further

256	  

experiments will be needed to determine the effects of serotonin on T1.

257	  

T1 and L2 provide synaptic feedback onto serotonergic neurons in the optic lobes

258	  

Serotonergic circuits often receive synaptic feedback from their target networks, as is the

259	  

case for long-range projections from the mammalian cortex and the retina back to the raphe

260	  

(Huang et al., 2017; Ogawa et al., 2014; Pollak Dorocic et al., 2014; Weissbourd et al., 2014; T.

261	  

Zhang et al., 2016). A number of processes in the fly optic lobe have been shown to be axo-

262	  

dendritic and contain both pre- and post-synaptic specializations (Meinertzhagen et al., 1991;

263	  

Takemura et al., 2013; Takemura et al., 2015). We speculated that serotonergic neurons in the

264	  

optic lobe might not only provide modulatory input, but also receive input from optic lobe

265	  

neurons. To explore this possibility, we used a SerT-GAL4 driver to express the dendritic

266	  

marker DenMark (Nicolai et al., 2010) in serotonin neurons that project to the optic lobe. We

267	  

found that the postsynaptic marker and serotonergic-immunolabeled puncta (representing pre-

268	  

synaptic release sites) were adjacent or overlapping at multiple sites in both the lamina (data

269	  

not shown) and medulla (Figure 4A).

270	  

To more directly test whether L1, L2 or T1 neurons synapse onto serotonergic

271	  

projections in the optic lobe we used an activity-dependent synaptic version of GFP

272	  

Reconstitution Across Synaptic Partners (sybGRASP) (Macpherson et al., 2015). In this variant

273	  

of GRASP, the presynaptic cell expresses split-GFP fused to the synaptic vesicle protein n-

274	  

synaptobrevin to direct one of the GFP fragments to vesicular release sites. The postsynaptic

275	  

cell expresses a fusion of the second fragment of GFP and the membrane protein CD4

(Macpherson et al., 2015). When L2 was presynaptic to serotonergic processes, reconstituted

277	  

GFP was observed in the lamina cortex and the medulla neuropil (Figure 4B,C and S2). In the

278	  

medulla neuropil, robust punctate GFP labeling was observed in layer M2 (Figure 4C) where

279	  

serotonin varicosities and L2 terminals converge. L2 neurons are cholinergic (Takemura et al.,

280	  

2015), and we observed reconstituted GFP either co-localized or closely apposed Drosophila

281	  

Vesicular Acetylcholine Transporter (VAChT) immunoreactive processes in and around M2

Figure 4. Visual neurons form sybGRASP
contacts onto postsynaptic serotonergic
processes. (A) SerT-GAL4 was used to express the
postsynaptic marker DenMark. Punctate DenMark
labeling (A, A’’) was detected in the medulla (me)
along with release sites labeled with anti-serotonin
(A’, A’’). (B-D) For SybGRASP, L2 or T1 split GAL4
drivers were used to express the presynaptic half of
GFP and the postsynaptic half of GFP was
expressed in serotonergic neurons using a TRHLexA driver. (B, C) With L2 neurons presynaptic to
TRH cells, sybGRASP signal was observed in cell
bodies in the lamina (arrowhead, see Supplemental
Figure for higher magnification) and in the medulla
neuropil (boxed area in B shown at higher
magnification in C). The sybGRASP signal was
adjacent to VAChT, a marker for cholinergic neurons
including L2 (B’, C’). (D) With T1 neurons presynaptic to TRH, sybGRASP signal was detected in
the medulla neuropil and adjacent to post-synaptic
anti-serotonin immunolabeling. n = 6-13 brains per condition. Scale bars: (A) 25 µm, (B) 15µm,

306	  

We similarly examined whether T1 neurons synapse onto serotonergic processes. As

307	  

with L2 neurons, punctate GFP labeling was present throughout the M2 layer of the medulla

308	  

representing contacts from T1 onto serotonergic neurons (Figure 4D). To allow co-labeling with

309	  

a marker for T1, we attempted to determine its neurochemical identity using a panel of

310	  

molecular markers for acetylcholine, glutamate and GABA, but failed to establish that T1

311	  

expresses ChAT, VGlut or GAD1 (Figure S3). We therefore relied on serotonin-immunolabeling

312	  

to mark the serotonergic component of the presumptive synapses. We found that reconstituted

313	  

GFP signal was adjacent to serotonin labeling in the medulla (Figure 4D”) and did detect

314	  

sybGRASP labeling in the lamina (data not shown). Together, these data suggest that T1

315	  

neurons synapse onto serotonergic processes in M2.

316	  

In contrast to L2 and T1, sybGRASP experiments in which L1 was presynaptic to

317	  

serotonergic cells, did not show reconstituted GFP in M2 or elsewhere in the neuropil of either

318	  

the lamina or medulla (Figure S4). However, we occasionally observed a sybGRASP signal in

319	  

L1 cell bodies within the lamina cortex (Figure S4), and we also observed labeling in cell bodies

320	  

in L2 sybGRASP experiments (Figure 4B and S2). We have not pursued this observation since

321	  

all known synaptic communication in Drosophila occurs in the neuropil rather than the cortex

322	  

and neurotransmitter release from lamina cell bodies has not been reported.

323	  
324	  

Serotonergic neurons likely signal through volume transmission in the optic lobe

325	  

Although some mammalian serotonergic neurons make synaptic connections (Gaspar et

326	  

al., 2012; Herve et al., 1987; Moukhles et al., 1997) most serotonergic signaling in the

327	  

mammalian brain occurs through extra-synaptic volume transmission (Bunin et al., 1999; Fuxe

328	  

et al., 2010; Trueta et al., 2012; Vizi et al., 2010). Little is known about serotonergic connectivity

329	  

in the Drosophila optic ganglia, and EM studies in other insects have revealed sites likely to

330	  

represent both synaptic and non-synaptic release (Nässel et al., 1984; Nässel et al., 1985). To

331	  

determine whether serotonergic neurons directly synapse upon L1, L2 or T1 cells, we again

332	  

used sybGRASP with serotonergic cells expressing the presynaptic component of GFP

333	  

(Macpherson et al., 2015). With SerT presynaptic to L2, T1 or L1 neurons we did not detect any

334	  

reconstituted GFP in the medulla (Figure S5) and only occasional GFP puncta in the lamina

335	  

cortex (3 out of 7 L2 brains, see Figure S5). Although it remains possible that serotonergic

336	  

synapses onto L1, L2 or T1 neurons were present but undetectable, this seems unlikely since

337	  

we observed a robust signal in parallel experiments in which the post-synaptic component of

338	  

GFP was expressed in serotonergic cells (see Figure 4). Together, these data suggest that

339	  

most signaling from serotonergic neurons onto L1, L2 and T1 neurons is likely to occur through

340	  

a non-synaptic mechanism, similar to the extensive use of volume transmission in the

341	  

mammalian brain (Fuxe et al., 2010; Vizi et al., 2010).

342	  

L2 and T1 neurons form reciprocal synaptic connections

343	  

L2 and T1 terminals converge with serotonergic processes in medulla layer M2 and we

344	  

reasoned that the two might have direct synaptic contact here. In examining previously

345	  

published ultrastructural studies, we found that synapses have been identified from L2 onto T1

346	  

neurons in the medulla, as well as from T1 onto L2 neurons, albeit to a lesser extent (Takemura

347	  

et al., 2013; Takemura et al., 2015). Using sybGRASP, we observed robust signals representing

348	  

presynaptic L2 contacts onto postsynaptic T1 sites and vice versa in layer M2 (Figure S6).

349	  

To confirm the synaptic nature of L2 and T1 neurons in this region, we used syt.eGFP

350	  

and DenMark markers to label pre and postsynaptic sites, respectively. In both neuron types,

351	  

we detected strong labeling with both syt.eGFP and DenMark in the medulla, supporting a

352	  

mixed axo-dendritic nature for both neuron types in the medulla (Figure S7). Our GRASP data

353	  

and previously published ultrastructural data are thus consistent with a reciprocal connection

354	  

between L2 and T1 neurons in the medulla, and more specifically, in layer M2.

355	  

Serotonin in visual processing

356	  
357	  

Having identified serotonin receptors in L2 and T1, and robust calcium accumulation in
L1 and L2 neurons in response to serotonin, we predicted that serotonergic neuromodulation

358	  

could impact visual processing. To test this hypothesis we used brief light or dark flashes to

359	  

stimulate L2 neurons with methods previously described (Yang et al., 2016). We expressed

360	  

GCaMP6f in L2 neurons and imaged terminals in the medulla of flies suspended over an LED

361	  

arena to present visual stimuli (see Figure 3A). Light and dark flashes of the entire LED screen,

362	  

each lasting 100 ms, were presented at 5 s intervals with intermediate-level brightness. One-

363	  

minute epochs consisting of 12 flashes of randomly shuffled polarity were presented six times

364	  

for each trial (Figure 5A). The first epoch was recorded in saline, followed by a switch to either

365	  

saline with 100 µM serotonin or saline alone. Similar to previous observations, serotonin

366	  

perfusion increased baseline calcium levels (Figure 3B, 5A). When flies were presented with a

367	  

light flash under baseline perfusion with saline, L2 neurons responded with an initial stimulus-

368	  

mediated decrease in GCaMP6f fluorescence, followed by a sustained increase (Figure 5D),

369	  

consistent with previous results (Yang et al., 2016). Strikingly, when perfusion was switched to

370	  

saline with serotonin, the amplitude of the L2 responses to light flashes was strongly enhanced

371	  

and continued to increase over the

372	  

course of the experiment (Figure 5E, G;

373	  

p<0.01).

following addition of serotonin to the bath. (F) Dark flash peaks for each 60s epoch show that
serotonin did not significantly impact responses (p>0.05). (D) When a light flash was presented
in control experiments, L2 cells responded with a decrease in GCaMP signal followed by a large
sustained increase. (E) The same waveform response was seen for L2 light responses in
serotonin. (G) The peak responses following a light pulse are summarized and show that
serotonin significantly increased the amplitude relatively to saline alone (p<0.01). For (B-G) n =
7-11 individual flies.

402	  
403	  

Dark flashes also induced a large increase in calcium that returned to baseline within ~1

404	  

second (Figure 5B), however, in contrast to light flashes, the effect on response amplitude to the

405	  

dark flash did not differ from saline controls (Figure 5F; p>0.05). These data indicate that in

406	  

addition to increasing absolute intracellular calcium levels, serotonin enhances L2 responses in

407	  

a stimulus specific manner.

Discussion

410	  

To begin our study of serotonergic regulation of the Drosophila visual system, we

411	  

mapped the expression of specific subtypes of serotonin receptors to visual processing neurons

412	  

in the optic lobe. We observed expression of serotonin receptors throughout the optic lobe, with

413	  

distinct expression patterns, suggesting a role for serotonin signaling in visual processing.

414	  

Specifically, we found that L2 neurons express 5-HT2B and that T1 neurons express 5-HT1A

415	  

and 5-HT1B, while L1 neurons do not consistently show expression of any serotonin receptors.

416	  

Our data are consistent with a recent report of transcriptional profiles for L1, L2, T1 as well as

417	  

other optic lobe neurons (Davis et al., 2018).

418	  

Recent work has reported serotonin receptor expression by photoreceptors (Davis et al.,

419	  

2018), and an earlier study described serotonergic modulation of potassium channels in

420	  

photoreceptors (Hevers et al., 1995). However, we did not detect expression of any serotonin

421	  

receptors in photoreceptors using MiMIC-GAL4 lines. It is possible that incomplete dissociation

422	  

of glia, which we suggest express 5-HT1B, could have contaminated isolates of photoreceptors

423	  

used in the prior genomic analysis of receptor expression (Davis et al., 2018). Likewise,

424	  

incomplete dissociation could have resulted in the presence of L2 processes on photoreceptor

425	  

cell preparations used for physiological preparations (Hevers et al., 1995). Since L2 provides

426	  

feedback onto photoreceptors R1-6 (Meinertzhagen et al., 1991), our demonstration that

427	  

serotonin modulates L2 neurons suggests a potential mechanism for the previous physiological

428	  

observations (Hevers et al., 1995). The use of MiMIC-GAL4 lines bypasses issues of cell

429	  

dissociation that were a caveat in previous strategies to map receptor expression. However, the

430	  

lower limits detection using this strategy are unclear. Therefore, we cannot at present rule out

431	  

the possibility that some photoreceptors express serotonin receptors that were not detected

432	  

using the MiMIC-GAL4 lines.

433	  

Serotonin signaling occurs via G-protein coupled receptors, which can induce immediate

434	  

or long-term changes in cell physiology. We examined acute responses to serotonin receptor

435	  

activation by bath applying serotonin onto optic lobe tissue. Consistent with the predicted

436	  

coupling of 5-HT2B to Gq, we found that L2 neurons respond with a robust increase in calcium

437	  

measured by GCaMP6f fluorescence (Figure 3B and S1A); however, we cannot rule out a

438	  

potential contribution from either 5-HT2A or 5-HT7, as both showed expression in our RT-qPCR

439	  

data set (Figure 2I). In contrast to the robust increase in calcium in L2 neurons in response to

440	  

serotonin, we did not observe a significant change in baseline calcium or voltage with T1

441	  

neurons (Figure 3E-F and S1C-D). It is possible that serotonin regulates dynamic patterns of

442	  

neuronal activity in T1 rather than static properties such as cytosolic calcium concentration or

443	  

resting membrane potential. Alternatively, other probes (e.g., for cAMP) may be necessary to

444	  

detect the acute response of T1 to serotonin. Either possibility could explain our inability to

445	  

detect an acute response to bath applied serotonin in T1 using either GCaMP or ArcLight.

446	  

However, it is also possible that activation of 5HT1 receptors do not induce significant acute

447	  

physiological responses, and that chronic changes in 5HT1 receptor activation are necessary to

448	  

induce measurable changes in T1.

449	  

In L1 neurons, which do not express serotonin receptors, we unexpectedly observed a

450	  

large calcium response to serotonin similar to that of L2 (Figures 3C and S1B). As these

451	  

experiments were performed in the presence of the voltage-gated Na+ channel inhibitor TTX,

452	  

which inhibits action potentials, we expect that the effect was non-synaptic. Notably, we did not

453	  

observe a comparable calcium change in T1 neurons, which do receive synaptic input from L2

454	  

neurons (Figure S6) (Takemura et al., 2015). A compelling explanation for the calcium effect in

455	  

L1 is that gap junction coupling with L2 neurons mediates the response indirectly (Joesch et al.,

456	  

2010). Joesch et al. (2010) found that electrical coupling was able to activate both L1 and L2

457	  

even when photoreceptor input to one of the two cells was blocked (Joesch et al., 2010). L1 and

458	  

L2 show immunolabeling with Shaking B (Joesch et al., 2010), a gap junction protein, and we

459	  

found here that both L2 and L1, but not T1 neurons, are enriched in Shaking B transcript (Figure

460	  

3D). Alternatively, L1 may be electrically coupled with other as yet unidentified cells that are

461	  

modulated by serotonin. Other mechanisms are also possible such as chemically mediated

462	  

synaptic inputs to L1 that do not depend on action potentials. Regardless of the underlying

463	  

mechanism, our data underscore the potential importance of an indirect pathway for

464	  

serotonergic neuromodulation here and in other circuits.

465	  

In both mammals and insects, serotonin can be released extra-synaptically through

466	  

volume transmission (Bunin et al., 1999; Descarries et al., 2000) or through synaptic sites

467	  

(Coates et al., 2017; Gaspar et al., 2012; Herve et al., 1987; Moukhles et al., 1997; Nässel et

al., 1985). The ultrastructure of serotonergic processes in the optic lobe of Drosophila is not

469	  

known; however, serotonergic release sites are exclusively non-synaptic in the lamina of the

470	  

blowfly Calliphora (Nässel et al., 1984). Our data obtained using sybGRASP (Figure S5) imply

471	  

that serotonin is released extra-synaptically in the neuropil of the medulla. Future experiments in

472	  

the fly visual system may be used to explore the poorly understood relationship between volume

473	  

transmission and specific sub-types of serotonin receptors.

474	  

Previous work in other systems indicates that feedback onto serotonergic neurons

475	  

regulates circuit function (Celada et al., 2001; Ogawa et al., 2014; Pollak Dorocic et al., 2014;

476	  

Weissbourd et al., 2014). This includes the mammalian visual system, in which ON and OFF

477	  

RGCs modulate serotonergic neurons in the raphe (Huang et al., 2017; T. Zhang et al., 2016).

478	  

Evidence for sensory system input to serotonergic neurons in insects includes an observed

479	  

decrease in tonic firing in response to light in the butterfly (Ichikawa, 1994) and input to

480	  

serotonergic clusters from olfactory neurons in Drosophila (Coates et al., 2017; X. Zhang et al.,

481	  

2016). Similarly, our sybGRASP data suggest that both L2 and T1 neurons make synaptic

482	  

contacts onto serotonergic processes in M2 (Figure 4). This, in addition to the reciprocal

483	  

synaptic contacts between L2 and T1 in layer M2 of the medulla (Figure S6 and (Takemura et

484	  

al., 2013; Takemura et al., 2015)) suggest that M2 may act as an important hub for

485

through receptors 5-HT2B, 5-HT1A, and 5-HT1B, respectively. Serotonin may act indirectly on
L1 neurons (blue circles), which are electrically coupled to L2 (indicated as a teal bar). L2 and
T1 neurons form reciprocal synaptic connections (solid arrows) with each other and with
serotonin projections within layer M2 of the medulla, possibly allowing local, serotonergic
neuromodulation within individual columns.

502	  
503	  

Since all of these interactions appear to occur within the same region, we speculate that

504	  

M2 represents a local hub to integrate neuromodulatory information for visual processing. To

505	  

further test this hypothesis, we are now developing molecular tags for 5-HT2B, 5-HT1A and 5-

506	  

HT1B to determine if they localize within layer M2. Although mammalian studies have primarily

507	  

focused on more long-range feedback loops, it is possible that individual serotonergic boutons

508	  

in mammals could also undergo local feedback, a potential mechanism to regulate specific

509	  

components of broadly projecting serotonergic neurons.	  

510	  

Serotonin modulates circadian behaviors in Drosophila (Nichols, 2007; Yuan et al.,

511	  

2005) and previous studies in other insects have found that serotonin levels vary throughout the

512	  

day (Kloppenburg et al., 1999; Saifullah et al., 2002), possibly correlating with changes in

513	  

photosensory input. It is possible that these effects are in part mediated by serotonergic

514	  

activation of L2 or other neurons involved in the initial steps of visual processing. Cell-specific

515	  

knock down of 5-HT2B or other serotonin receptors could be used to address this possibility.

516	  

Here, we focus on the effects of serotonin on visual processing.

517	  

In Drosophila, L1 and L2 neurons detect changes in luminance and together are

518	  

necessary for the full complement of motion vision. Both neurons receive synaptic input from

519	  

photoreceptors, and respond to luminance changes with graded potentials, depolarizing in dark

520	  

conditions and hyperpolarizing in light (Clark et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2016; Zheng et al., 2006).

521	  

These two neurons feed into parallel pathways to enable further visual processing such as

522	  

motion and contrast detection (Bahl et al., 2015; Maisak et al., 2013; Strother et al., 2014). The

523	  

enhancement of visually induced calcium transients in L2 following serotonin application (Figure

524	  

5G) suggests a role for serotonin in potentiating the response of L2-dependent visual

525	  

processing pathways (Yang et al., 2016). It is possible that serotonin could regulate the

526	  

response to synaptic input from photoreceptors. Alternatively increased calcium levels in L2

527	  

terminals following serotonin application could increase neurotransmitter release onto the

528	  

neurons postsynaptic to L2. In either case, the effects of serotonin on L2-dependent pathways

529	  

will only become evident in experiments testing the responses of downstream neurons such as

530	  

Tm1, Tm2 and Tm4 (Shinomiya et al., 2014; Takemura et al., 2013; Takemura et al., 2011).

531	  

In general, both L1 and L2 respond to both light and dark flashes and it is unclear why

532	  

the response of L2 to dark pulses was not significantly enhanced by serotonin (Figure 5F).

533	  

Unlike the experiments shown in Figure 3, TTX was absent from the perfusion for the visual

534	  

response experiments shown in Figure 5, so it is possible that the observed effects of serotonin

535	  

on L2 include input from additional sites, and that non cell-autonomous serotonergic effects

536	  

dampened the response of L2 to dark flashes. Previous experiments in Calliphora underscore

537	  

this possibility and the complexity of serotonin’s effects on the visual system (Chen et al., 1999).

538	  

In these previous studies, extracellular electroretinograms were used to record the combined

539	  

output of L1 and L2 neurons in the lamina (Chen et al., 1999). While injection of serotonin into

540	  

the haemolymph increased both the light ON and the light OFF transients, serotonin injected

541	  

directly into the retina led to a net reduction in both the ON and OFF responses (Chen et al.,

542	  

1999). These complex effects suggest that multiple serotonergic pathways can influence the

543	  

activity of L1 and L2 neurons, possibly including non-cell autonomous activation of serotonin

544	  

receptors on neurons that innervate L1 and/or L2 neurons.

545	  

To understand these effects and to identify the mechanisms by which serotonin

546	  

regulates visual processing it will be necessary to examine multiple cellular components in the

547	  

ON/OFF pathways beyond L2. Studies in mammals have already begun to dissect the

548	  

contributions of serotonergic tuning in multiple cells within individual circuits including the visual

549	  

system (Gagolewicz et al., 2016; Halberstadt, 2015; Li et al., 2018; Moreau et al., 2010; Zhou et

550	  

al., 2018). However, the way in which this information is integrated remains poorly understood.

551	  

We speculate that interactions between receptors expressed on L2, T1 and other neurons in the

552	  

fly visual system may provide a framework to dissect the mechanism by which multiplexed

553	  

serotonergic inputs combine to regulate circuit function.

554	  

In other dipteran species, T1 neurons respond to increased luminance with a

555	  

hyperpolarization and decreased luminance with a depolarization, similar to L2 and L1

556	  

(Douglass et al., 1995; Järvilehto et al., 1973). In Drosophila, depolarizing T1 neurons leads to

557	  

disruptions in steering and other visually directed behavior (Tuthill et al., 2013), however its

558	  

precise role in visual processing remains enigmatic. Interestingly, the same behavioral deficits

559	  

that were seen following inactivation of L1 or L2 were seen when T1 was activated (Tuthill et al.,

560	  

2013). It is possible that T1 acts to provide feedback or buffering to L2 output. Since T1, L2 and

561	  

serotonergic terminals all converge in the M2 region of the medulla, we speculate that

562	  

interactions in this region may be critical to visual processing as well as neuromodulatory

563	  

effects. If so, testing the effects of serotonin on T1 may help us to determine its function in

564	  

visual processing.

565	  
566	  

Conclusion

567	  

We find that L1 and L2, two neurons at the head of most visual processing pathways in

568	  

Drosophila, respond to serotonin signaling with an increase in calcium. In L2 neurons, this was

569	  

sufficient to enhance the response to bright flashes. We also identified a potential regulatory

570	  

microcircuit that includes processes from serotonergic, L2, L1 and T1 neurons, all converging

571	  

within medulla layer M2. Our data suggest that L2 and T1 neurons synapse directly onto

serotonergic projections in M2, establishing a potential mechanism for neuromodulatory

573	  

feedback or a route for communicating visual input to the central brain. We demonstrate that

574	  

serotonin has a multifaceted effect on visual processing by 1) selectively targeting individual cell

575	  

classes via differential receptor expression, 2) leveraging indirect mechanisms to broaden

576	  

sensory modulation and 3) enforcing stimulus specific response modulation by targeting distinct

577	  

L2 response features. In future work, we will continue to explore the mechanisms underlying

578	  

these effects and the possibility of reciprocal signaling between serotonin projections and other

579	  

visual processing neurons in the optic lobe.

Immunohistochemistry and Imaging

728	  

Flies were dissected 5-10 days after eclosion, and equal numbers of males and females

729	  

were used for all experiments unless otherwise noted. Brains were dissected in ice-cold PBS

730	  

(Alfa Aesar, Cat#J62036, Tewksbury, MA), then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (FisherScientific,

731	  

Cat#50-980-493, Waltham, MA) in PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100 (Millipore Sigma, Cat#X100,

732	  

Burlington, MA) (PBST) for one hour at room temperature. Brains were washed three times with

733	  

PBST for 10 minutes, then blocked for 30 minutes in PBST containing 0.5% normal goat serum

734	  

(NGS) (Cayman Chemical, Cat#10006577, Ann Arbor, MA) PBST. Antibodies were diluted in

735	  

0.5% NGS/PBST. Primary antibodies were incubated with the tissue overnight at 4°C. The next

736	  

day, the brains were washed three times with PBST for 10 minutes, then incubated with

737	  

secondary antibodies for 2 hours in the dark at room temperature. Brains were washed three

738	  

times with PBST for 10 minutes, followed by 60% and 80% glycerol (Millipore Sigma,

739	  

Cat#G5516) before mounting with Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech, Cat#0100-01, Birmingham,

740	  

AL).

741	  

Serotonin immunolabeling was performed with 1:25 rat anti-serotonin (Millipore Sigma,

742	  

Cat#MAB352, RRID:AB_11213564), 1:1000 rabbit anti-serotonin (ImmunoStar, Cat#20080,

RRID:AB_572262). Where noted, GFP was labeled with 1:250 mouse anti-GFP (Sigma-Aldrich,

745	  

Cat#G6539, RRID:AB_259941; or, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, Cat#A-11120,

746	  

RRID:AB_221568). Secondary antibodies were used at 1:400 and include: Alexa Fluor 488, 594

747	  

or 647 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Westgrove, PA, Cat#715-545-151, # 711-585-

748	  

152, # 712-605-153) or Alexa Fluor 555 (Life Technologies, ThermoFisher, Cat#A-21428).

749	  

When serotonin receptor MiMIC-GAL4 lines were combined with VGlut, ChAT and

750	  

GAD1 MiMIC-LexA (Supplemental Figure S2), brains were processed and imaged as described

751	  

in Sizemore and Dacks 2016 (Sizemore et al., 2016).

752	  

MultiColor FlpOut (MCFO-1) sparse labeling was induced by heat activation at 37°C for

753	  

10-15 minutes at least 2 days prior to dissection as described (Nern et al., 2015). Primary

754	  

antibodies included 1:300 rabbit anti-HA (Cell Signaling Technology, Cat#3724, Danvers, MA,

755	  

RRID:AB_1549585), 1:150 rat anti-FLAG (Novus, Littleton, CA, Cat#NBP1-06712,

Cat#MCA1360D550GA, RRID:AB_2687576). N-Synaptobrevin GFP Reconstitution Across

758	  

Synaptic Partners (sybGRASP) flies (Macpherson et al., 2015) were dissected, fixed and

759	  

immunolabeled as described above, without KCl induction. The tissue was labeled with mouse

760	  

antiserum specific to reconstituted GFP (1:250; Sigma-Aldrich, Cat#G6539, RRID:AB_259941)	  

761	  

(Gordon et al., 2009) and either anti-serotonin (antibodies listed above) or rabbit anti-VAChT

762	  

(1:500; provided by Hakeem Lawal) (Boppana et al., 2017).

763	  

Imaging was performed with a Zeiss LSM 880 Confocal with Airyscan (Zeiss, Oberkochen,

764	  

Germany) using a 40x water or 63x oil immersion objective. Images shown represent a single

765	  

optical slice except where indicated. Post-hoc processing of images was done with Fiji

766	  

(Schindelin et al., 2012) or Adobe Photoshop (Adobe, San Jose, CA) .

768	  

L2, T1 and L1 neurons were labeled using split-GAL4 drivers (Tuthill et al., 2013)

769	  

combined with UAS-mCD8::GFP (RRID:BDSC_5137). Brains were dissected on the day of

770	  

eclosion and optic lobes were dissociated according to previously published methods (Tan et

771	  

al., 2015) The dissociated optic lobe cells were separated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting

772	  

(FACS) into GFP-positive and GFP-negative isolates using a BD FACS Aria II high-speed cell

773	  

sorter in collaboration with the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center (JCCC) and

774	  

Center for AIDS Research Flow Cytometry Core Facility

775	  

(http://cyto.mednet.ucla.edu/home.html). For FACS, each experiment was performed with 18-40

776	  

brains, and yielded between 1,700-7,800 GFP+ cells. RNA was extracted from isolated cells with

777	  

ARCTURUS® PicoPure® RNA Isolation Kit (ThermoFisher, KIT0204) followed by reverse

778	  

transcription with SuperScript III (Invitrogen, ThermoFisher, Cat#18080093).

779	  

RT-qPCR was performed for receptor mRNA using validated primers (Supplemental

780	  

Table 2) and SYBR Green Power PCR Mix (Applied Biosystems, ThermoFisher) on an iQ5 real-

781	  

time qPCR detection system (Bio-Rad). Primers were designed using Primer-Blast

782	  

(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/) or were from the DGRC FlyPrimerBank (Hu et

783	  

al., 2013); oligonucleotides were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, Iowa).

784	  

Primer pairs were validated to amplify a single product, verified by a single melting temperature

785	  

and single band on an electrophoresis gel. The efficiency for each primer pair was between 85-

786	  

115%. Comparisons between GFP+ and GFP- samples were calculated as enrichment (i.e., fold

787	  

change) using the comparative CT method (Schmittgen et al., 2008). A zero value was imputed

788	  

for samples with no amplification (i.e., no CT value). Raw CT values are shown in Supplemental

789	  

Table 1.

custom-built fly holder. The fly holder was based on a previously described design (Weir and

794	  

Dickinson, 2015). The head capsule and the thorax were glued to the metal shim using UV-

795	  

curable glue (www.esslinger.com). The legs, proboscis and antennae were immobilized using

beeswax applied with a heated metal probe (Waxelectric-1, Renfert). The head capsule was

797	  

immersed in insect saline (103 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 1.5mM CaCl2, 4 mM MgCl2, 26 mM

798	  

NaHCO3, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM trehalose, 10 mM glucose, 5 mM TES, 2 mM sucrose)

799	  

(Wilson et al., 2004). A small window on the right rear head capsule was opened using sharp

800	  

forceps (Dumont, #5SF). Muscles and fat covering the optic lobe were cleared before placing

801	  

the fly under the 2-photon microscope (VIVO, 3i: Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Denver, CO).

802	  

Neurons expressing GCaMP6f were imaged at 920-nm using a Ti:Sapphire Laser (Chameleon

803	  

Vision, Coherent). Images were acquired at 10-20 frames/s. Only female flies were used for live

804	  

imaging experiments.

805	  

A custom-built gravity perfusion system was used for bath application of either serotonin

806	  

or saline control to the fly’s exposed optic lobe. The tissue was first perfused with insect saline

807	  

containing 1µm tetrodotoxin citrate (TTX) (Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel, Cat#T-550) for at

808	  

least 5 minutes at 2 mL/min, prior to each recording. TTX remained present throughout the

809	  

experiment. To examine the effects of serotonin on calcium levels, baseline GCaMP6f

810	  

fluorescence was recorded for one minute before switching to the second input containing either

811	  

100µM serotonin hydrochloride (Sigma Aldrich, Cat# H9523) or saline alone for an additional

812	  

five minutes of recording. Due to perfusion tubing length and dead volume, the perfusion switch

813	  

took approximately 1 min 45 s to reach the tissue.

814	  

Visual Stimulus Experiments

815	  

Visual stimuli were shown using an arena composed of 48 eight by eight-pixel LED

816	  

panels, at 470 nm (Adafruit, NY, NY). The panels were assembled into a curved display that

817	  

extends 216° along the azimuth and ±35° in elevation. Each pixel subtended an angle of 2.2° on

the retina at the equatorial axis. To prevent spurious excitation of the imaging photomultiplier

819	  

tubes, three layers of blue filter (Rosco no. 59 Indigo) were placed over the LED display.

820	  

Each stimulus consisted of a brief increment (light flash) or decrement (dark flash) of the

821	  

entire display for 100ms, before returning to a mid-intensity brightness for 4.9s. Images were

822	  

acquired at 25-30 frames/s. Stimuli were presented in sets of six bright and six dark flashes

823	  

randomly shuffled for each minute of the experiment. Responses were then pooled for each

824	  

minute. During the first minute, and prior to imaging, the tissue was perfused with saline for a

825	  

baseline recording. At the end of the first minute, a valve controller (VC-6, Warner Instruments,

826	  

Hamden, CT) activated by a TTL signal switched the perfusion to either saline with 100µM

827	  

serotonin or saline alone; imaging then continued for an additional five minutes, for a total of

828	  

one baseline set and five post-switch sets of stimuli. The perfusion switch took approximately

829	  

50s to reach the tissue.

830	  
831	  

Analysis

832	  

Calcium imaging data were analyzed with Matlab R2017a (Mathworks, Natick, MA). Post

833	  

hoc, recordings were corrected for movement of the brain within the imaging plane using a

834	  

custom algorithm (Akin et al., 2016). Regions of interest (ROIs) were found semi-automatically

835	  

for each experiment: first, the median intensity of all pixels across all image frames was found;

836	  

this value was used as a threshold and all pixels with mean intensity below the threshold,

837	  

typically within the image background, were discarded. The 1-D time-series of intensity for each

838	  

remaining pixel was then extracted. K-means clustering was used to identify pixels with similar

839	  

activity over the course of the experiment; three clusters were identified, and the cluster that

840	  

included the highest number of pixels was used as an ROI. This reliably identified the pixels

841	  

within active neurons in the imaging data and aided in identifying preparations with out-of-plane

842	  

movement, which were discarded. The mean intensity within the ROI was found for each image

843	  

frame to produce a single time-series for the entire experiment. Approximately half of the bath

844	  

application recordings showed oscillations in activity due to slow, periodic movement of the

845	  

brain at around 0.04 Hz; we applied a notch filter at this frequency with a bandwidth of 0.005 Hz

846	  

to remove these oscillations. For the bath application experiments (Figure 3), we plotted ΔF/F,

847	  

defined as (Ft-F0)/F0, where Ft is the mean fluorescence in the ROI at the indicated time and F0

848	  

is the mean value of Ft during 60 seconds of baseline activity at the beginning of the experiment

849	  

and prior to the change in perfusion. For the visual stimulus experiments (Figure 6), we again

850	  

plotted ΔF/F, defined as (Ft-F0)/F0, where Ft is the mean fluorescence in the ROI at the indicated

851	  

time and F0 is the mean of 30 seconds of non-consecutive baseline activity between trials in

852	  

epoch 0 at the beginning of the experiment and prior to the change in perfusion (Figure 6A-E).

853	  

For further analysis, we calculated Fpeak for each epoch, defined as the maximum ΔF/F value

854	  

that occurred for each light or dark stimulus presentation within 1.75 s after cessation of the

855	  

0.1 s flash; for each fly, we found the mean of the maximum values for the six light flashes or

856	  

the six dark flashes that occurred within each epoch of 60 seconds. We then normalized the

857	  

Fpeak values for each fly by calculating Fpeak/Fpeak(0), where Fpeak(0) is the fly’s Fpeak value for epoch

858	  

0 at the beginning of the experiment and prior to the change in perfusion. The median of the

859	  

Fpeak/Fpeak(0) values was then found for the saline and serotonin groups (Figure 6F, G). We used

860	  

a two-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test to compare the Fpeak/Fpeak(0) values for the saline versus

861	  

serotonin groups.
