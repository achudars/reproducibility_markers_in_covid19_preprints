Abstract
Vestigial structures are key indicators of evolutionary descent but the

19

mechanisms underlying their development are poorly understood. This study examines

20

vestigial eye formation in the teleost Astyanax mexicanus, which consists of a sighted

21

surface-dwelling morph and different populations of blind cave morphs. Cavefish

22

embryos initially develop optic primordia but vestigial eyes are formed during larval

23

development. Multiple genetic factors are involved in cavefish eye loss but none of the

24

mutated genes have been identified. Here we identify cystathionine ß-synthase (cbsa),

25

which encodes the key enzyme of the transsulfuration pathway, as a mutated gene

26

responsible for eye degeneration in multiple cavefish populations. The inactivation of

27

cbsa affects eye development by inducing accumulation of the transsulfuration

28

intermediate homocysteine and defects in optic vasculature, including aneurysms and

29

eye hemorrhages, leading to oxygen deficiency. Our findings suggest that localized

30

modifications in the circulatory system and hypoxia had important roles in the evolution

31

of vestigial eyes in blind cavefish.

Introduction
Vestigial structures, such as the reduced wings of flightless birds, the hind limb

35

remnants of pythons, and the degenerate eyes of blind cavefish, were key factors in

36

Darwin’s recognition of descent with modification during evolution. However, the

37

genetic and physiological mechanisms responsible for the development of rudimentary

38

structures are still poorly understood.

In the teleost Astyanax mexicanus, blind cavefish (CF) have been derived

39
40

repeatedly from sighted surface fish (SF) ancestors1-3. The loss of eyes in A.

41

mexicanus CF involves initial optic development followed by subsequent degeneration1,

42

2

43

undergoes massive apoptosis, the retina becomes apoptotic and disorganized, and eye

44

growth is eventually arrested during larval development 3-5. Accordingly, the rate of

45

optic growth fails to keep pace with the increase in overall body size as CF larvae

46

develop into adults, and the small non-functional eyes are overgrown by skin and

47

connective tissue. About 30 distinct CF populations with various degrees of eye

48

reduction have evolved in Mexican caves after colonization by surface fish ancestors

49

during the mid-to late Pleistocene, and several of these CF populations have evolved

50

vestigial eye phenotypes independently 6,7. Similar eye reduction or loss occurs in other

51

cave dwelling species8 and animals adapted to other perpetually dark habitats9.

. Eye primordia with a lens and retina are formed in CF embryos, but the lens

52

The existence of hybridizable surface dwelling and cave adapted morphs in A.

53

mexicanus has allowed eye degeneration to be studied by genetic methods2. These

54

studies have shown that eye loss in the Pachón CF (PA-CF) population is controlled by

55

multiple genetic factors, each controlling a part of the complex vestigial eye

56

phenotype10-12. Furthermore, complementation crosses between different CF

57

populations have demonstrated that some of the genetic factors involved in eye loss are

58

the same whereas others are unique13. In addition to genetic changes, epigenetic

59

events may also have roles in the evolution of CF eye loss14. Quantitative trait locus

60

(QTL) analysis revealed about 15 non-overlapping genomic regions that are responsible

61

for lens and eye reduction in PA-CF10-12,15. The alignment of eye QTL with the PA-CF

62

genome sequence has suggested numerous candidates for genes controlling vestigial

63

eye formation,15. However, the identities of the inactivated genes within these QTL

64

intervals, the type of mutations that are present, and the genetic mechanisms operating

65

to generate the eyeless phenotype, have not been established.

66

Here we identify cystathionine ß-synthase a (cbsa) as one of the inactivated

67

genes responsible for eye degeneration in multiple A. mexicanus CF populations.

68

Studies of the hypomorphic cbsa phenotype revealed a novel mechanism for arresting

69

eye growth based on accumulation of the transsulfuration intermediate homocysteine

70

and disruption of optic vasculature. Our findings suggest that interference with normal

71

circulatory system function by a cbsa mutation may have played a critical role in the

72

evolution of CF eye degeneration.

cbsa as a candidate gene for cavefish eye loss
To identify a mutated gene responsible for CF eye loss, we examined the A.

78

mexicanus Ensembl Scaffold KB871589.1 from, which contains the peak marker of an

79

eye size QTL located between hsp2bp and ankrd10a (Fig. 1a)11-13,15. According to the

80

Ensembl AstMex 1.0.2 genome assembly, this scaffold contains 21 predicted protein-

81

coding genes. We surveyed these genes by qualitative RT-PCR for expression

82

differences in SF and PA-CF at 40 hpf (Fig. 1a; Table S1), when many changes

83

associated with eye degeneration first appear in CF1-5. Since CF eye degeneration is a

84

recessive trait2-5, we focused on genes that are downregulated in PA-CF relative to SF,

85

and four such genes were identified: cystathionine ß-synthase a (cbsa), αA-crystallin

86

(cryaa), heat shock factor 2 binding protein (hsf2bp), and cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase 2

87

(cars2) (Fig. 1a). We next focused on protein coding genes expressed in the eyes.

88

Accordingly, the cars gene was not pursued further because it encodes a mitochondrial

89

aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase16. Of the remaining genes, the cryaa gene, although

90

expressed in the lens, was also not studied further because it was previously shown to

91

be under trans-acting regulation during CF development17. The hsf2bp gene encodes a

92

heat shock transcription factor 2 binding protein18. We used in situ hybridization to

93

determine the pattern of hsf2bp expression during normal culture at 25°C or following a

94

1 hour 37°C heat shock (Fig. 1b). The results indicated that hsf2bp expression was

95

ubiquitous in SF and PA-CF, and although expression was increased during a heat

96

shock, the increase was not particularly strong in the eyes (Fig. 1b), so we also

97

excluded this gene from further consideration. Thus, our attention ultimately focused on

98

cbsa, a gene that is expressed in the developing eyes and other locations in A.

anomaly in the CF eye loss by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of gene expression data15.
We first examined the expression pattern of cbsa and its paralog cbsb during SF

102

and PA-CF development by in situ hybridization with gene specific probes (Fig. 2a-p).

103

At early stages of embryonic development (10–20 hours), the patterns of cbsa and cbsb

104

expression were similar in SF and PA-CF, including in the developing eye primordia,

105

although cbsa expression was markedly weaker in PA-CF than in SF (Fig. 2a–f), and

106

cbsb expression was generally stronger than cbsa in PA-CF (Fig. 2a–f and i–n). By 40

107

hours of development, cbsa and cbsb expression was seen in many developing organs

108

(Fig. 2g, h, o and p). The expression of cbsa was strong in the SF head, including the

109

eyes and parts of the brain, heart, pectoral fin buds, pancreas, liver, and myotomes

110

(Fig. 2h). The pattern of cbs gene expression in Astyanax surface fish closely

111

resembled that reported in zebrafish19. In PA-CF cbsa expression was downregulated

112

in all of these organs except the pancreas (data not shown) and liver (Fig. 2h). The

113

expression of cbsb was similar in most of these organs in SF and PA-CF at 40 hpf, with

114

the notable exception of the head and myotomes, where cbsb expression was reduced

115

in both PA-CF and SF (Fig. 2o and p). The results suggest that cbsa and cbsb show

116

mostly overlapping expression in during SF and PA-CF development, except for the PA-

117

CF eyes and myotomes in which neither of the cbs paralogs was strongly expressed.

118

The results suggested that cbsb expression could compensate for downregulated cbsa

119

expression is all parts of CF larvae except for the eyes. The in situ hybridization results

120

were confirmed by comparing cbsa and cbsb expression in isolated larval heads and

121

trunks by qualitative and quantitative RT-PCR at 40 hpf, which showed that cbsa, but

122

not cbsb, is significantly downregulated in PA-CF larval heads at this developmental

123

stage (Fig. 2q).

124

The results described above suggested that cbsa expression is downregulated in

125

the anterior regions of PA-CF larvae, including the eyes. Eye loss is thought to have

126

evolved independently at least twice in different A. mexicanus CF populations1,2,13.

127

Therefore, we conducted in situ hybridization to determine whether cbsa expression is

128

also changed in additional CF populations. The results showed similar patterns of cbsa

129

downregulation at 40 hpf, including the degenerating eyes, brain, and myotomes, in PA-

130

CF, TI-CF, LS-CF, and MO-CF (Fig. 2r). The results establish cbsa as a candidate for

131

controlling eye loss in multiple CF populations.

132
133

The cavefish cbsa gene contains a hypomorphic mutation

134

We next asked whether downregulation of the cbsa gene in PA-CF is caused by

135

cis- or trans-acting regulation by conducting F1 hybrid tests15,20. In these experiments,

136

SF females were crossed with PA-CF males to generate F1 hybrids, RNA was extracted

137

from the heads of the F1 hybrid and parental larvae at 40 hpf, and a portion of the cbsa

138

coding region containing an SNP marker distinguishing the SF and CF alleles was

139

amplified by PCR, cloned, and sequenced (Fig. 3a). The results showed that

140

expression of the PA-CF cbsa allele was not increased in the F1 hybrid background, as

141

would be expected under trans-acting control, thus implicating cis-regulation as the

142

cause of cbsa downregulation.

143

To identify potential cis-regulating mutations, we sequenced the SF and PA-CF

144

cbsa loci and immediate flanking regions. Although the draft genome sequences of SF

145

and PA-CF are available in Ensembl (Astyanax_mexicanus-2.0 and AstMex1.0.2

146

respectively), gaps and possible assembly problems did not permit reliable detection of

147

putative mutations across the large genomic span of the cbsa gene locus. Therefore,

148

we re-sequenced about 32 kb of PA-CF and SF genomic DNA spanning the cbsa loci

149

and flanking non-coding regions between the upstream gemin8 and downstream cryaa

150

genes. The results showed that the SF and CF cbsa genes consist of 15 exons (Fig. 3b).

151

We used RACE to identify the SF and CF cbsa transcripts and to survey them for

152

possible sequence differences. The 5’ non-coding regions of CF and SF cbsa mRNAs,

153

which correspond to the first non-coding exon and the first few bases of the second

154

exon, showed only two nucleotide differences. In addition, the CF cbsa coding region

155

has no internal stop codons, suggesting that it encodes a complete CBSA protein (Fig.

156

S1a). The deduced PA-CF and SF CBSA proteins are 99% identical, differing by only

157

five amino acids (Fig. S1b). Only one of the divergent amino acids (G 257) is conserved

158

in other known vertebrate CBS proteins. Although it is possible that PA-CF CBSA is

159

functionally different from SF CBSA because it is missing a run of two amino acids

160

(G257-K258; Fig. S1c) that are present in other teleost CBS proteins, this difference

161

cannot account for hypomorphic activity of the PA-CF cbsa gene.

162

Outside the protein coding regions, there are only a few substitutions in the 7 kb

163

non-coding region located between cbsa and gemin8, which shows 99% nucleotide

164

identity between PA-CF and SF, or in the 5 kb non-coding region located between cbsa

165

and cryaa, which is also highly conserved in SF and PA-CF17. In addition, cbsa introns

166

are also highly conserved in PA-CF, except for the following: a 5 bp insert in intron 1, a

167

323 bp deletion in intron 6, and a 120 bp insertion in intron 8 (Table S1). To explore the

168

possibility that one or more of these PA-CF cbsa introns contain potential cis-regulatory

169

changes, we amplified and compared the sequences surrounding the changes in introns

170

1, 6, and 8 in the PA-CF, TI-CF, LS-CF, CH-CF, JI-CF, and MO-CF cbsa genes.

171

Genetic studies have shown that eye loss evolved independently at least twice among

172

some of these CF populations2,11,13, and our in situ hybridization data indicated that

173

cbsa is downregulated in PA-CF, TI-CF, LS-CF, and MO-CF eyes (Fig. 2). We found

174

that the indels in introns 6 and 8 were present in some, but not all, of these CF

175

populations (Table S1), suggesting that they are unlikely to be generally responsible for

8

176

cbsa downregulation. In contrast, small inserts consisting of two different sequences

177

were found at the same position in intron 1 in all six CF populations (Fig. 3c),

178

suggesting that this region may include a cis-acting mutation.
We next searched for enhancers in the genomic region between the 3’ termini of

179
180

the gemin8 and cbsa genes using iEnhancer-2L21. This tool predicted 5 putative

181

enhancers, but most of them showed little or no sequence differences between PA-CF

182

and SF, and no enhancers were predicted within cbsa introns 6 or 8. However, a

183

putative enhancer (E region, Fig. 1b) was detected in intron 1 of cbsa, which includes

184

the indels in all six CF populations. When a SF 1040 bp DNA fragment including the E

185

region was inserted into the pCMV-GFP expression vector and injected into SF eggs,

186

the reporter construct drove GFP expression in the myotomes, brain, and eyes of 40 hpf

187

SF embryos (Fig. 3d-f). These results support the presence of a cis-acting mutation in

188

an enhancer located in the large first intron of the PA-CF cbsa gene, although other cis-

189

acting changes, within or beyond the currently sequenced regions, may also contribute

190

to cbsa downregulation during PA-CF development. These results (and functional data

191

below) suggest that cbsa could be one of the mutated genes responsible for CF eye

192

loss.

193
194
195

Cavefish show homocystinuria-like features
The cbsa gene encodes cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), the limiting enzyme of

196

the methionine/transsulfuration pathway, which converts homocysteine (hCys) to

197

cystathionine, a precursor of cysteine and glutathione22 (Fig. 4a). Mutations in the

198

human cbs gene are the major cause of homocystinuria, a disorder in methionine

199

metabolism leading to toxic hCys accumulation and eye abnormalities23,24. In fact, the

200

small eyes of CF larvae resemble the eyes of some homocystinuria patients in showing

201

an “off-center” lens2-5. To test the possibility that CF show homocystinuria-like features,

202

we compared hCys levels by ELISA quantification and determination of the expression

203

of activating transcription factor 3 (atf3), a major hCys-sensitive gene25, in CF and SF

204

larvae. There ELISA results showed 4–6 fold increases of hCys levels in PA-CF and

205

TI-CF larvae at 40 hpf (Fig. 4b). We also detected strong upregulation of the atf3 gene

206

in PA-CF and TI-CF relative to SF between about 2 and 4 days post-fertilization (dpf)

207

(Fig. 4c). To determine the developmental effects of elevated hCys, we injected hCys

208

into SF eggs and examined larval morphology. The results showed that about 21% of

209

the SF larvae developing from hCys injected eggs showed reduced eye size, the

210

displacement of the lens to the ventral side of the eye, or complete eye loss, although

211

other morphological features were not visibly affected (Fig. 4d, f, and g; Table S2a). In

212

contrast, much fewer control larvae developing from eggs injected with cysteine showed

213

effects on eye development (Fig. 4a, e; Table S2a). Together, these results indicate that

214

CF exhibit homocystinuria-like features that impact eye development.

215
216
217

Defects in cavefish optic vasculature
High hCys levels have effects on cardiovascular function, increasing the risk of

218

blood clots, aneurysms, and hemorrhagic stroke in homocystinuria patients and Cbs +/−

219

mice26,27. Therefore, we examined vasculature development and function in CF by

220

microangiography, blood cell staining, and eye imaging. The results revealed leaky optic

221

and brain vasculature, erythrocyte pooling and aneurysms around the eyes, and eye

222

hemorrhages in PA-CF larvae, but not in SF larvae (Fig. 5a-i). Eye hemorrhages were

223

frequently observed in CF larvae (Fig. 5g–h, j), but not in more than 1000 SF larvae

224

evaluated in this study (Fig. 5f). The eye hemorrhages were generally unilateral,

225

ranging from small foci on the dorsal side of the eye to large areas of the orbit, and were

226

present for only about 3–4 days in most larvae (Fig. 5l). During this period, the

227

degenerating CF eyes were invaded by phagocytic macrophages, probably to remove

228

leaked blood cells (Fig. 5k). Survival studies showed that PA-CF larvae with eye

229

hemorrhages have similar viability to SF larvae (Fig. 4m), showing that defective optic

230

vasculature does not decrease CF viability. The results indicate that optic vasculature

231

is defective in CF.

232
233
234

Role of cbs genes in eye and optic vasculature development
To address the role of the cbs genes in eye and vasculature development, we

235

knocked down cbsa and cbsb expression by injecting SF eggs with splice-inhibiting

236

morpholinos (MO) (Fig. 6a-c). To validate this approach, we amplified and sequenced

237

PCR products from the cbs morphants and obtained products of two different sizes: one

238

with sequence corresponding to the processed cbsa exon 5 and 6 or cbsb exon 3 and 4,

239

and the other with sequence corresponding to unprocessed introns containing the

240

expected translation stop sites (Fig. S2a-d). The cbsa and cbsb MOs were specific for

241

the corresponding genes respectively: PCR products derived from unprocessed mRNAs

242

were obtained only when cbsa or cbsb MOs were injected, and only products

243

corresponding to processed mRNAs were obtained when control MO was injected (Fig.

244

S2a, b). The specific effects of the cbs MOs on eye development were also confirmed

11

245

by controls showing that expression of the major intrinsic protein (mip), cryaa,

246

orthodenticle homeobox2 (otx2), and SRY (sex determining region Y)-box2 (sox2), all of

247

which are expressed in developing Astyanax forebrains and eyes14,15, decreased in the

248

eyes (when present; see below) of cbsa and cbsb morphants, but not in control

249

morphants (Fig. S2g, h). In contrast, there were no differences in otx2 or sox2

250

expression between the forebrains of control and cbs morphants (Fig. S2h). The results

251

demonstrate specificity of the respective MOs for knocking down the cbsa or cbsb

252

genes.

253

We next determined the effects of cbs MO knockdown on eye development. The

254

cbsa morphants developed a large number of small eyes with ventrally-displaced lenses,

255

the typical CF eye phenotype2-5, and most of the cbsb morphants showed small eyes or

256

completely missing eyes (Fig. 6b and c, n; Fig. S2g; Table S2b, c). No other gross

257

morphological deficiencies were noted in the cbs morphants (Fig. S2g). Control

258

morphants did not show these optic phenotypes (Fig. 6a; Fig. S2g; Table S2b, c). Co-

259

injection of cbsa and cbsb MOs generated the same eye phenotypes as single MO

260

injections, suggesting functional redundancy of the paralogous cbs genes (data not

261

shown). The effects of cbsa MOs and cbsb MOs on eye development could be rescued

262

by co-injection of cbsa mRNA (Fig. 6n), confirming the specificity of the cbs MO effects.

263

The effects of cbsa MO knockdown on SF eye development were confirmed by

264

CRISPR-Cas9 editing of the cbsa gene. Using this method, mutations were introduced

265

into exons 2 or 3 of cbsa (Fig. 6j) with about 29% efficiency (N = ???). Similar to the

266

cbs morphants described above, larvae with CRISPR-Cas9 mutations showed

267

abnormal or missing eyes (Fig. 6k-m). Together, the MO knockdown and CRISPR-Cas9

268

editing results indicate that expression of the cbs genes is required for normal eye

269

development in Astyanax.
We also examined the roles of cbs MO knockdown on hCys accumulation and

270
271

optic vasculature development. As a proxy for hCys levels, we determined aft3

272

expression at 40 hpf in cbsa and cbsb morphants and found markedly increased

273

expression of atf3, but not the control gene sonic hedgehog a (shha), in both cases (Fig.

274

6o). These results are consistent with the conclusion that cbs knockdown causes an

275

increase in hCys levels. To determine the effects on vasculature development, we

276

conducted microangiography in cbs and control MO-injected larvae. The cbsa

277

morphants showed leaky vasculature around the developing eyes and the brain, and

278

cbsb morphants showed leaky optic vasculature (Fig. 6d-f), or failed to develop cranial

279

vasculature (data not shown), whereas vascular integrity was not compromised in

280

control morphants (Fig. 6d). In addition, imaging indicated that some cbsa and cbsb

281

morphants developed visible hemorrhages around the eyes and other cranial areas (Fig.

282

6h and i), but no hemorrhages were observed in control morphants (Fig. 6g). These

283

results demonstrate that elevated hCys and optic vasculature phenotypes similar to

284

those of CF can be generated by cbs gene knockdown in SF.
In summary, the results show that blocking cbs gene expression can promote

285

291

To further understand the role of the circulatory system in CF eye degeneration,

292

we knocked down expression of the rap1b gene in SF. The rap1b gene disrupts

293

endothelial junctions and is critical for normal vasculature development in zebrafish28.

294

The rap1b morphants lacked erythrocytes in and around the eyes, implying that normal

295

vascularization of the eye was defective (Fig. 7a). The rap1b morphants and controls

296

initially showed eyes of similar size (Fig. 7b, d). Later in development, however, the

297

rap1b morphants exhibited significantly smaller eyes than controls (Fig. 7c, e),

298

demonstrating that knockdown rap1b expression affects eye growth in Astyanax. These

299

results suggest that the effects of the hypomorphic cbsa gene on eye growth can be

300

phenocopied by blocking blood circulation in rap1b morphants and provide evidence

301

that defective optic vasculature may be an important factor in CF eye degeneration.

Degenerating Cavefish Eyes Exhibit Hypoxia
One of the functions of optic vasculature is to supply the growing larval eyes with

305

oxygen. Therefore, the discovery of defective optic vasculature opened the possibility

306

that CF eyes may be deficient in oxygen. To explore this possibility, the Astyanax

307

homologs of genes that that are highly sensitive to hypoxia in zebrafish29,30 were

308

identified and their expression levels compared in isolated SF and PA-CF heads and

309

trunks at 36 hpf (Fig. 8a, b). The hypoxia-sensitive genes examined were hypoxia

310

inducible factor 1αa (hif1αa) and hif1 αb (hif1αb), which encode master regulators of

311

hypoxia31, hemopexin (hpx), a major hemolysis-sensitive heme scavenger32, myoglobin

312

(mb), an oxygen transporter in muscle cells33, and oxidative stress growth inhibitor 1

313

(osgn1). The fatty acid desaturase 2 (fads2) and ribosomal protein s3a (rps3a) genes

314

were selected as internal references. The results revealed that the hif1αa, hpx, and mb

315

genes were significantly upregulated in the heads of PA-CF compared to SF and to PA-

316

CF trunks (Fig. 8a, b). The fads2 gene, which is downregulated during hypoxia in

317

zebrafish29, was slightly increased in PA-CF heads compared to trunks, but the rps3a

318

gene, which is upregulated during hypoxia in the liver of another teleost34, was also up-

319

regulated in PA-CF relative to SF larval trunks (which contain the developing liver),

320

although it was expressed at about the same level in heads (Fig. 8a, b). We also used

321

antibody staining to determine the expression of the master hypoxia regulating factor

322

HIF1α during SF and CF eye development. Early in development, when both SF and

323

PA-CF eyes are both increasing in size, HIF1α was not detected in SF or PA-CF eyes,

324

but as optic development proceeded and growth was arrested, PA-CF but not SF eyes

325

showed HIF1α antibody staining, which continued to be present throughout the

326

subsequent period of eye degeneration in (Fig. 8c- e). Together, the results of the

327

hypoxia gene expression studies and HIF1α antibody staining suggest that

328

degenerating PA-CF eyes exhibit hypoxia.

Optic vasculature disruption is independent of lens dysfunction
Previous studies showed that lens apoptosis is an early mediator of CF eye

332

degeneration9,10. We conducted the following experiments to understand the

333

relationship between lens dysfunction, cbsa downregulation, and optic vasculature

334

defects in CF. First, we injected SF with cbs MOs as described above and assayed lens

335

apoptosis in morphant and control larvae at 40 hpf by staining with Lysotracker Red.

336

Apoptotic cells were detected the lens of CF larvae, as described previously9,10, but not

337

in SF larvae injected with cbsa, cbsb, or control MOs, showing that cbs knockdown

338

does not promote lens apoptosis (Fig. 8a, d). Second, we removed the lens from the

339

optic cup on one side of a SF head at 30 hpf and determined whether this operation

340

induced optic hemorrhaging later in development. The results showed that optic

341

hemorrhages were absent throughout the remainder of development in SF larvae

342

lacking a lens (Fig. 8f).Together, these results suggest that the lens dysfunction and

343

cbsa downregulation/defective optic vasculature development are independent events.

Discussion
In the present study, we have identified cbsa as one of the genes responsible for

347

eye loss in A. mexicanus CF. Furthermore, our studies of the hypomorphic cbsa

348

phenotype suggest a novel mechanism for CF eye degeneration based on the

349

disruption of optic circulatory function and hypoxia. Our work builds on previous studies

350

carried out during the past several decades that determined the multiplicity of genetic

351

factors involved in CF eye loss1,2,10, identified numerous QTL and corresponding

352

genomic regions responsible for the regressive CF eye phenotype11-13, 15, and tested

353

candidate genes for mutations and roles in CF eye degeneration17. However, none of

354

the previous studies were successful in identifying any of the mutated genes

355

responsible for CF eye loss.

356

Our study, along with information from some of the previous studies mentioned

357

above, provides multiple lines of evidence indicating that cbsa is one of the mutated

358

genes responsible for CF eye degeneration. The cbsa gene is located near the peak

359

marker of an PA-CF eye size QTL11,15, was recognized as a potential candidate for

360

controlling CF eye loss by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of gene expression data15, and is

361

downregulated in eyes and other tissues during larval development in four different CF

362

populations: PA-CF, LS-CF, TI-CF, and MO-CF. Importantly, two or more of these CF

363

populations are thought to have evolved the eyeless phenotype independently, although

364

genetic analysis has shown that they share some of the same genetic factors involved

365

in eye loss13. Our results suggest that cbsa may be one of the shared genes.

366

Furthermore, we have described a potential cis-acting mutation at the same position in

367

the first intron of the cbsa gene in six different A. mexicanus CF populations (including

368

the four CF populations above), a region that contains an enhancer capable of driving

369

reporter gene expression in SF eyes, brain, and myotomes, the same regions in which

370

cbsa is downregulated during CF larval development. We have also presented MO

371

knockdown and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing results showing that the cbsa gene is

372

required for SF eye development. When cbsa function was disrupted eye formation

373

was completely abolished or small eyes with ventrally displaced lenses-the typical CF

374

larval eye morphology2-5-were formed without affecting general larval morphology. Our

375

results are also consistent with the possibility that the hypomorphic cbsa gene is

376

responsible for the phenotypic effects represented by an Astyanax eye QTL. However,

377

more comprehensive identification and functional testing of other genes within this QTL

378

interval will be needed to conclude that it is the only gene in the corresponding genomic

379

region that is mutated and involved in eye degeneration. It is also important to note that

380

cbsa is one of many genetically10-13,15 or epigentically14 modified factors that may

381

collaborate to regulate CF eye degeneration, and that other genes remain to be

382

discovered to fully understand this complex phenotype.

383

Our studies of the CF cbsa phenotype revealed that A. mexicanus CF show

384

similarities to the human disease homocystinuria and mouse Cbs models of this disease

385

with respect to eye abnormalities, elevated hCys levels, and deficiencies in the

386

cardiovascular system23-27. We found 4-6 fold increases in hCys levels in PA-CF and

387

TI-CF larvae relative to SF larvae, whereas Cbs+/- mice show two-fold elevation of hCys

388

levels, and an approximate 40-fold increase in hCys has been estimated in Cbs-/- mice,

389

which die in utero26,27,35. We showed that cbsa expression is decreased in the head of

390

A. mexicanus CF larvae, although it remains constant in the trunk, due to strong and

391

probably upregulated expression in the developing CF liver and pancreas. The

392

moderate homocystinura-like effects in CF, and the ability CF to survive them and

393

develop into healthily adults, is likely due to compensation for cbsa downregulation by

394

the paralogous cbsb gene, which is not downregulated in PA-CF or under a known eye

395

QTL15. Consultation of archived ENSEMBL genomic sequence data indicate that

396

duplication of an ancestral cbs gene into cbsa and cbsb paralogs occurred in teleost fish

397

before the split between the families containing zebrafish and Astyanax. Zebrafish cbsa

398

and cbsb show similar patterns of expression and knockout results suggesting that the

399

paralogous cbsa and cbsb genes show redundant functions19. The A. mexicanus cbsa

400

and cbsb genes are co-expressed in most larval organs, with notable exception of the

401

eyes (and parts of the brain), which is the likely reason that hypomorphic effects of cbsa

402

are restricted to the developing CF eyes and do not engender an overall lethal

403

response, such as seen in Cbs-/- mice27. We also observed cbsa expression in the SF

404

brain, as has also been reported for cbs genes in zebrafish19 and mouse36, and cbsa

405

downregulation in the CF brain. Brain regions responsible for visual processing, namely

406

the optic tecta, are regressed along with the eyes during CF evolution37,38. Therefore,

407

mutated cbsa might promote the regression of CF eyes and optic tecta as a functional

408

unit.

409

Mutations in the cbs gene reduce life expectancy in homocystinuria patients

410

because of cardiovascular and other problems and are responsible for cardiovascular

411

defects in mouse CBS models of homocystinuria24-27. We discovered defects in CF

412

optic and cranial vasculature, including vascular leakages, eye hemorrhages, and

413

aneurysms, during the critical period of eye degeneration. The localization of these

414

defects to eyes and the brain are attributed to cbsa downregulation and the absence of

415

sufficient compensating cbsb expression in these areas. In our study, none of the

416

above defects in optic vasculature were seen in more than 1000 SF larvae, except

417

when the cbs genes were knocked down by MO injection, implying that cbs expression

418

is also required for vasculature development and/or function in A. mexicanus. Despite

419

the occurrence of optic vasculature defects, our results have shown that overall CF

420

development is not affected, and survivorship under laboratory conditions is about the

421

same as in SF lacking vascular defects. Thus, the reversibility of homocystinuria-like

422

pathologies in CF highlights the potential of A. mexicanus as a natural model for

423

investigating the recovery from hemorrhagic stroke and related cardiovascular diseases.

424

Our results suggest that inhibition of circulatory system function triggered by cbsa

425

downregulation is an important mechanism for inhibiting eye growth in A. mexicanus.

426

We substantiated this conclusion by showing that eye growth can be arrested by

427

knockdown of the rap1b gene in SF, which prevents vasculature from invading the eyes

428

during larval development. During teleost development, vasculature initially forms in the

19

429

trunk, and embryonic eye formation in the non-vascularized head is dependent on

430

passive diffusion of oxygen39. As larvae increase in size during subsequent

431

development, passive diffusion is no longer sufficient for eye development, and the eyes

432

begin to require oxygen, nutrients, and humoral factors provided by neovascularization

433

in the head40. The late reliance of developing eyes on oxygen provided by blood flow

434

would explain why CF form eyes early and eye regression begins later in development.

435

Consistent with this interpretation, our work provides evidence that regressing CF eyes

436

are deficient in oxygen by showing the upregulation of several hypoxia gene markers in

437

the larval head, including the master hypoxia regulator HIF1α, which was restricted to

438

regressing CF eyes. Therefore, we propose a model in which deficiency in oxygen,

439

and/or nutritional and humoral factors, normally provided to growing eyes by the

440

circulatory system, is responsible for optic regression in CF (Fig. 10). Interference with

441

eye growth by blocking the blood supply may confer an evolutionary benefit by

442

eliminating the high energetic cost of maintaining eyes, which are useless in the dark

443

cave environment41,42. These findings open the possibility that interference with

444

circulatory system function could also inhibit eye formation in other cave adapted

445

animals, and may have a general role in the evolutionary regression of vestigial organs.

446

Previous studies showed that lens dysfunction is involved in the early stages of

447

CF eye degeneration but these studies also recognized that additional factors must be

448

involved in this process3,4. The complexity of CF eye loss was also supported by the

449

multiplicity of genetic factors underlying this process10-13. Our results suggest that

450

optic vasculature defects and lens dysfunction are independent processes in the

451

complex CF eye regression phenotype, and that they are likely controlled by different

452

genes. It will be interesting to determine whether other genes underlying this process

453

contribute to the defective optic vasculature phenotype, the lens dysfunction phenotype,

454

both of these phenotypes, or reveal additional changes involved in vestigial eye

455

formation.

462

Jeffery laboratory. Fish were maintained and spawning was induced as described

463

previously43. Embryos and larvae were raised at 23–25°C. Some SF embryos were

464

cultured with 400 μM phenylthiourea (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) to reduce

465

pigmentation prior to in situ hybridization, blood staining, and immunocytology (see

466

486

genes from scaffold KB871589.1 in the Ensembl AstMex1.0.2 PA-CF genome release

487

are listed in Table S3. The primers used for PCR amplification of other genes with

488

expression levels determined by qualitative RT-PCR are listed in Table S4. The PCR

489

cycling conditions for qualitative RT-PCR were 1 cycle of initial denaturation at 94°C for

2 minutes, followed by 25 to 32 cycles of denaturation (94°C for 30 seconds), annealing

491

(60°C for 30 seconds), and elongation (72°C for 30 seconds), and a final elongation

492

To determine whether the SF or PA-CF cbsa allele was expressed in hybrids,

524

PCR reactions were performed to amplify a 327 bp region of the cbsa coding region

525

containing the SF- and CF-specific mononucleotide markers using the forward primer

purified with the MinElute Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and cloned into the

530

Dual Promoter PCR II-TOPO Vector using the TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Life

531

TOPO plasmids were sequenced using the M13-20 and M13rev primers provided with

534

the kit to distinguish which cbsa clones contained the SF or CF marker.

RACE Reactions and Sequencing

537

The 5’ and 3’ ends of SF and PA cbsa mRNA were determined using the

GGAGACGGATCACTTTGCCCTGGTGGT-3’. The PCR reactions were performed

548

using the Advantage 2 PCR Kit (Clontech). The PCR conditions were five cycles at

549

94°C for 30 seconds and 72°C for 3 minutes; 5 cycles at 94°C for 30 seconds, 70 °C for

550

30 seconds, and 72°C for 3 minutes, 27 cycles at 94°C for 30 seconds, 68°C for 30

551

seconds, and 72°C for 3 minutes. For the nested PCR reactions, the cycling conditions

552

were 20 cycles each at 94°C for 30 seconds, 68°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 3

553

minutes. The PCR products were purified with the MinElute PCR Purification Kit

554

(Qiagen) and sequenced with nested gene-specific primers.

Genome Walking and Sequencing
The SF and PA cbsa gene loci and flanking regions were amplified and

558

sequenced by genome walking17. Briefly, the entire SF and PA-CF cbsa genomic DNA

559

sequences were amplified using the GenomeWalker™ universal kit (Clontech

560

Labotatories, Mountain View, CA) and the overlapping genomic regions were

561

sequenced step by step using the primers listed in Table S6. For the construction of

562

GenomeWalker libraries, genomic DNA was digested with EcoRV, Dra I, PvuII, and StuI

563

I. The GenomeWalker PCR reactions were performed with TaKaRa LA Taq™ (Takara

564

567

568

To amplify SF and PA-CF cbsa intron 6, which was not covered by genome

569

walker generated or Ensembl sequences (AstMex1.0.2), we used the forward primer

570

5’AGATCGTCCGTACCCCTACC-3’, which corresponds to a region located in cbsa

exon 5, and the reverse primer 5’-TGCCAGCTGAAGTGTGCTTA-3’, which corresponds

572

to a region located in intron 11. The PCR reactions were performed using Phusion High-

573

Fidelity PCR Master Mix (New England Biolabs). The PCR cycling conditions were 1

574

cycle of initial denaturation at 98°C for 30 seconds, followed by 35 cycles each of

575

denaturation at 98°C for 8 seconds, annealing at 68°C for 25 seconds, extension at

576

72°C for 5.5 minutes, and a final elongation step at 72°C for 10 minutes. The PCR

577

products were purified with the MinElute Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) and sequenced.

578

To amplify the genomic region between cbsa and the adjacent upstream gene

579

gemin8, we designed 14 pairs of primers (Table S6) using incomplete sequences

580

available in the Ensembl PA-CF database. The PCR reactions were performed by PCR

581

Master (Roche, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany), and the PCR

582

products were inserted into the TOPO vectors, and both the PCR products and TOPO

583

plasmids were sequenced. After sequencing, low-quality reads and pCRII TOPO vector

584

sequences were removed, the sequences were trimmed, and clean genomic sequence

585

reads were assembled with DNAstar SeqMan Pro software.

588

Genomic DNA was extracted from tailfin clips of six different CF populations (see

589

above) using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen). The primers used to amplify the

590

region surrounding the indel in cbsa intron 1 were 5’-GCCTGCATGTGCCAGAGGGG-3’

591

(forward) and 5’-CCGCCGCCAAAACATTGCGT-3’ (reverse). The PCR cycling

592

conditions were one cycle of initial denaturation at 98°C for 30 seconds, followed by 35

593

cycles of denaturation (98°C for 5 seconds), annealing (at 60°C for 15 seconds),

594

extension (at 72°C for 15 seconds), and a final extension at 72°C for 7 minutes. The

595

primers used to amplify the region surrounding intron 6 were 5’-

596

CCAGAGGCAGACATGTTTCCGATT-3’ (forward) and 5’-

597

GGAGGCTGCAGAGTACTGACAGT-3’ (reverse), and the PCR cycling conditions were

598

the same as those used for the intron 1 region. The primers used to amplify the region

599

surrounding intron 8 were 5’-TGGCTTCAAGCAAGGGCGGG-3’ (forward) and 5’-

600

AGTTGCGGGCAACATCATACCCT-3’ (reverse). The PCR cycling conditions were the

601

same as those used to amplify intron 1, except that annealing was done at 58°C for 15

602

seconds. All PCR reactions were performed using Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Master

603

Mix (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), and the PCR products were purified

604

with the MinElute PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) and sequenced.

607

Enhancer Transgenesis
Potential enhancers were identified in cbsa non-coding DNA sequence using

608

iEnhancer-2L21. The predicted enhancer (E in Fig. 1e) in cbsa intron 1, which showed

609

major sequence differences between SF and all 6 types of CF, was inserted into the

610

pCMV-GFP vector for expression analysis. The 1140 bp E region was amplified from SF

611

genomic DNA using the forward primer 5’-TGGACGAACGACCAACATTT-3’ and

612

reverse primer 5’-TGCAACTGAAACTGTGCAACT-3’. The pcbsa-CMV-GFP DNA

613

construct containing the predicted enhancer was made by blunt end ligation at the SpeI

614

site in the vector. The plasmid was confirmed by sequencing with the EGFP-N primer

615

5’-CGTCGCCGTCCAGCTCGACCAG-3’. Control (pCMV-GFP) and pcbsa-CMV-GFP

616

DNA constructs and transposase mRNA (25 ng each) were injected into 1-cell SF

617

embryos, and GFP expression was determined by fluorescence microscopy at 40 hpf.

618
619
620

Gene Knockdown and Rescue
Knockdown of the cbsa and cbsb genes was done using the splice inhibiting

621

morpholinos cbsa MO 5’-CAATGCTAATGCTTTTACCTTCTCC-3’, which targeted cbsa

622

exon 5 of the cbsa gene, and cbsb MO 5’AGCCACTGCAAACACACATACATCA-3’,

623

which targeted cbsb exon 4. The rap1b translation blocking MO 5’-

624

TCTACAGCCGTGTCTCGTCCTC-3’ targeted part of the 5’ UTR and translation start

625

site of the rap1b mRNA. The control MO was 5’-CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA-

626

3’. The MOs were designed and synthesized by Gene Tools, Inc (Philomath, OR). The

627

cbsa and cbsb MOs were injected into 1–2 cell SF embryos at concentrations of 0.25

628

mM or 0.5 mM, the rap1b MO was injected into 1–2 cell SF embryos at a concentration

629

of 0.125 mM, and the morphants were cultured through the early larval stages. Eye

630

measurements were done in controls and morphants using ImageJ software45.

631

For RT-PCR validations, the cbsa and cbsb morphants were collected at 40 hpf

632

and total RNA was isolated and cDNA synthesized as described above. The primers

633

used to amplify the region containing the cbsa sequence change were 5’-

635

(reverse). The primers used to amplify the region containing the cbsb sequence change

636

were 5’-GGAAAATTGGAGACACGCCG-3’ (forward) and 5’-

637

ATGATGCAGCGGTAACCCTT-3’ (reverse).

638

For MO rescue, cbsa mRNA was microinjected into 1–2 cell cbsa or cbsb

639

morphant embryos at a concentration of 75 ng/μl in sterile water containing 0.05%

640

phenol red. To prepare cbsa mRNA, the full length coding region was amplified from SF

641

cDNA using 5’-GGGCTCGAGCGAATCAGCACCACCTGAAC-3’ (forward) and 5’-

642

GGGTCTAGAAACCATTCCTTTCAGAGACTGGA-3’(reverse) primers, which included

643

XhoI and XbaI sites. The purified PCR product was digested with XhoI and XbaI, ligated

644

into the pCS2+ vector, and the chimeric plasmid was confirmed by sequencing. After

645

linearization with NotI, the capped mRNA was transcribed using mMESSAGE

646

mMACHINE Sp6 kit (Life Technologies). After transcription, cbsa mRNA was recovered

647

by LiCl precipitation, washed in 70% ethanol, re-suspended in sterile H2O, and stored at

648

−20°C.

649
650
651

CRISPR-Cas9 Gene Editing
To knockout the cbsa gene in SF, sgRNA and Cas9 mRNA was co-injected into

652

one-cell embryos. The cbsa CRISPR targets were designed with the online tool

653

http://crispr.dfci.harvard.edu/SSC/, and the 20-nt target sequence was confirmed online

654

(http://www.e-crisp.org). For sgRNA synthesis, we used a cloning-free, oligo-based

655

method46. The sgRNA target sequence in cbsa exon 2 was 5’-

656

AGGGTCCATTCTCTTTGCTG-3’, and the sgRNA target sequence in cbsa exon 3 was

657

5’-ATCTTGTTGATGCGCACAAG-3’. The T7 promoter (GG) was added to the 5’ end of

658

the target sequence, and the 20-nt overlapping crRNA-TracrRNA sequence was added

659

to the 3’ end of the sgRNA target sequence. The sgRNA oligo was assembled by PCR

660

using the Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (New England Bio Labs, Ipswich, MA).

661

The reaction conditions were denaturation at 98°C for 2 minutes, annealing at 50°C for

662

10 minutes, and extension at 72°C for 10 minutes. The PCR product was confirmed by

663

agarose gel electrophoresis and purified with the MinElute PCR Purification Kit

664

(Qiagen). The sgRNA was transcribed in vitro using the MEGAshortscript High Yield T7

665

kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) and purified with NucAwayTM Spin Columns (ThermoFisher

666

Scientific). For Cas9 mRNA preparation, we used the pST1374-NLS-linker-Cas9 vector

667

(Addgene, USA). The pST1374-NLS-linker-Cas9 (10 µg) was digested with PmeI

668

(BioLabs, New England Inc), purified, and 1 ug DNA was used in an in vitro transcription

669

reaction with the T7 mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (ThermoFisher Scientific), and the

670

transcribed RNA was purified using NucAway TM Spin Columns (ThermoFisher

671

Scientific). We co-injected 25 pg of sgRNA and 300 pg of Cas9 mRNA into one-cell

672

stage SF embryos. CRISPR-Cas9 injected and control un-injected embryos from the

673

same clutch were cultured at 25 °C and phenotyped at 40 hpf by microscopy. Genomic

674

DNA was extracted from embryos with defective eye development and controls, and

675

nested PCR was used to amplify the edited sites. For the exon 2 site, the flanking

676

primers were 5’-GGGAGTCCAAATGAGTGGGT-3’ (forward) and 5’-

677

TTCCCGGGATGGGATTGTGA-3’ (reverse), and the nested primers were -5’-

678

Homocysteine Determination and Injection
hCys was quantified in SF, PA-CF, and TI-CF larvae using the Homocysteine

687
688

ELISA Kit (Cell Biolabs Inc, San Diego, CA). Samples containing 100 larvae each were

689

homogenized in PBS, the homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000× g for 15 min at 4°C,

690

and the supernatant fraction was collected and assayed immediately according to the

691

instructions of the manufacturer.
L-homocysteine and L-cysteine (both purchased from Sigma Aldrich) were

692
693

diluted to 1–5 mM in sterile water containing 0.05% phenol red, microinjected into 1–2

694

cell SF embryos, and the effects on eye development were determined in SF larvae at 4

695

dpf.

696
697
698

Microangiography
Microangiography was performed as described previously47. Briefly, un-injected

699

SF, PA-CF and cbsa or cbsb MO injected embryos were mounted in 1.2% low melt

700

agarose prepared in zebrafish embryo medium48. Embryos were injected with Qtracker

709

Macrophage and Red Blood Cell Staining
Vital staining for macrophages was done by incubating 4–10 dpf PA-CF larvae

710

with 25 μg/ml Neutral Red in fish system tank water for 12 hours at room temperature in

711

the dark49. Embryos were stained for red blood cells for 15 minutes with 0.6 mg/ml o-

712

dianisidine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), 0.01 M sodium acetate (pH 4.5), 0.65%

713

hydrogen peroxide, and 40% (v/v) ethanol in the dark50. After staining, the embryos

714

were rinsed in PBS, post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 1 hour, rinsed in PBS,

715

and stored in 80% glycerol.

716
717
718

Antibody Staining
SF and PA-CF larvae from 1.5–12 dpf were fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4°C,

719

dehydrated through an increasing series of methanol concentrations to 100% methanol,

720

and stored at −20°C. The larvae were rehydrated, blocked with superblock solution

721

containing 5% goat serum and incubated in a 1:100 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-

722

HIF1α primary antibody (Catalogue Number 114977, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for 48

723

hours at 4°C, rinsed with superblock, then incubated with 1:200 dilution of Alexa Fluor

724

Lens Deletion and Apoptosis Detection

730

The lens was removed from the optic cup on one side of 23 SF embryos at about

731

30 hpf by microdissection using Tungsten needles51 and hemorrhaging was assayed by

732

light microscopy from 2–8 dpf.
