ABSTRACT
Drosophila R7 UV photoreceptors (PRs) are divided into yellow (y) and pale (p) subtypes
with different wavelength sensitivities. yR7 PRs express the Dpr11 cell surface protein and
are presynaptic to Dm8 amacrine neurons (yDm8) that express Dpr11’s binding partner
DIP-γ, while pR7 PRs synapse onto DIP-γ-negative pDm8 neurons. Dpr11 and DIP-γ
expression patterns define yellow and pale medulla color vision circuits that project to
higher-order areas. DIP-γ and dpr11 mutations affect the morphology of yDm8 arbors in the
yellow circuit. yDm8 neurons are generated in excess during development and compete for
presynaptic yR7 partners. Transsynaptic interactions between Dpr11 and DIP-γ are
required for generation of neurotrophic signals that allow yDm8 neurons to survive. yDm8
and pDm8 neurons do not normally compete for neurotrophic support, but can be forced to
do so by manipulating R7 subtype fates. DIP-γ-Dpr11 interactions allow yDm8 neurons to
select yR7 PRs as their home column partners.

INTRODUCTION
The chemoaffinity hypothesis (Sperry, 1963) proposed that assembly of neural circuits
involves interactions among cell-surface proteins (CSPs) that label individual neurons or
neuronal types. This hypothesis applies well to systems such as the Drosophila brain and
vertebrate retina in which synaptic connectivity is largely controlled by intrinsic gene
expression patterns. There are approximately 1000 CSPs encoded in the Drosophila
genome that are likely to be involved in cell-cell recognition events (Kurusu et al., 2008). In
the pupal visual system, (Tan et al., 2015) characterized CSP gene expression in R7 and R8
photoreceptors (PRs) and the five types of lamina neurons (L1-L5), which relay
information from R1-R6 PRs. Each of these seven neuronal types expresses more than 250
of the 1000 CSP genes, and each type differs from any of the others by expression of least
50 CSP genes.

To find the CSPs in these cellular expression profiles that are likely to be important for
circuit assembly, we and others have focused on interaction partners expressed on
synaptically connected neurons. The “Dpr-ome” is a network of immunoglobulin
superfamily (IgSF) CSPs that was discovered in an in vitro “interactome” screen of all
Drosophila IgSF proteins(Carrillo et al., 2015; Özkan et al., 2013). The current Dpr-ome has
21 2-IgSF Dpr proteins (Nakamura et al., 2002), each of which binds to one or more of the
11 3-IgSF DIP proteins. Most DIPs interact with multiple Dprs and vice versa, and their
binding affinities vary between 1 and 200 µM (Cosmanescu et al., 2018). Each DIP and Dpr
is expressed in a unique subset of neurons at each stage of development. In the visual
system, neurons expressing a DIP tend to be postsynaptic to neurons that express a Dpr to

which that DIP binds in vitro (Carrillo et al., 2015; Cosmanescu et al., 2018; Davis et al.,
2018; Tan et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2018b). DIPs and Dprs define an IgSF family, present in
both protostomes and deuterostomes, that has been denoted as the Wirins. The five
mammalian IgLON proteins are members of the Wirin family (Cheng et al., 2019b).

Genetic analysis of DIP-Dpr pairs has revealed a variety of phenotypes. DIP-γ and Dpr11
regulate neuromuscular junction (NMJ) morphology in larvae, and control survival of DIPγ-expressing postsynaptic cells in the pupal optic lobe (Carrillo et al., 2015; Xu et al.,
2018b). Interactions between postsynaptic DIP-α and presynaptic Dprs 6 and 10 also
control survival of postsynaptic optic lobe neurons, and can determine their synaptic
connectivity patterns (Xu et al., 2018b). In the larval and adult neuromuscular systems,
however, DIP-α and Dpr10 control branching of DIP-α-expressing motor axons onto muscle
fibers that express Dpr10 (Ashley et al., 2019; Cheng et al., 2019a; Venkatasubramanian et
al., 2019). Dprs and DIPs regulate fasciculation and sorting of olfactory receptor neuron
axons in the antennal lobe (Barish et al., 2018). In the lamina of the optic lobe, DIPs prevent
ectopic synapse formation (Xu et al., 2018a).

DIPs and Dprs may be components of large CSP repertoires that confer a unique surface
identity to each type of neuron. Each neuron uses its repertoire to sculpt its morphology,
determine its synaptic connectivity, and regulate its physiological properties. The total
number of CSP genes is only about fourfold larger than the size of a repertoire (Tan et al.,
2015), so the repertoires of different neurons necessarily overlap. Two neuronal types

might have some of the same CSPs in their repertoires but use them in different ways,
depending on their developmental needs.

Here we show that Dpr11 and DIP-γ expression patterns define a labeled-line color vision
circuit that includes R7 PRs and Dm8 amacrine neurons in the medulla of the optic lobe. R7
and R8 transmit chromatic information from the retina to the medulla. R7 is a UV receptor,
while R8 responds to visible light. Each ommatidium in the compound eye contains an R7,
an R8, and six achromatic PRs (R1-R6) that transmit information relevant to motion
detection (Figure 1A). R1-R6 synapse onto lamina neurons, which in turn project to layers
M1-M5 of the medulla. R7 and R8 axons grow through the lamina and into the medulla,
where they terminate in layers M6 (R7) and M3 (R8) (Figure 1C). The medulla is a tenlayered neuropil that is divided into columns, each of which roughly corresponds to one of
the ~750 ommatidia of the compound eye. It contains about 100 types of neurons. Some of
these arborize only in the medulla, either in single columns or across multiple columns,
while others have dendrites in the medulla and project to higher-order visual areas,
including the lobula and lobula plate (reviewed by (Hadjieconomou et al., 2011; Sanes and
Zipursky, 2010)).

There are two major types of ommatidia, pale (p) and yellow (y), which are randomly
distributed in the retina. R7 and R8 PRs in these ommatidia are divided into subtypes with
different spectral sensitivities. p ommatidia (~35%) detect shorter wavelengths, and have
R7 that express the Rh3 (shorter-wave UV) rhodopsin and R8 that express Rh5 (blue),
while y ommatidia (~65%) detect longer wavelengths, and have R7 that express Rh4

(longer-wave UV) and R8 that express Rh6 (green) (reviewed by (Viets et al., 2016))(Figure
1B). The R7 and R8 within an ommatidium mutually inhibit each other(Schnaitmann et al.,
2018).

Drosophila phototaxes to UV (R7) in preference to visible light (R8). It also exhibits true
color vision, being able to make intensity-independent discriminations among hues that
differentially stimulate p and y R8 channels (Melnattur et al., 2014)(reviewed by (Song and
Lee, 2018)). To be able to distinguish blue from green, or short from long-wavelength UV,
the fly must have different neural responses to stimulation of p and y R8 and R7 channels
and utilize these response profiles to control its actions.

In our earlier work, we showed that Dpr11 is selectively expressed by yR7 PRs (Figures 1EE’) while its binding partner DIP-γ is expressed by a subset of Dm8 amacrine neurons,
which are the primary synaptic partners for R7 (Carrillo et al., 2015). Here we show that
yR7 PRs specifically connect to DIP-γ-expressing Dm8 neurons (yDm8), while pR7 PRs
connect to DIP-γ-negative Dm8 neurons (pDm8) in their respective y and p “home
columns”. Analysis of the electron microscopic (EM) reconstruction of the medulla
(Takemura et al., 2013; Takemura et al., 2015) in light of this connection pattern shows
that there are separate yellow and pale circuits that could be used for discriminating long
and short-wavelength UV inputs. The yellow circuit might be constructed using DIP-γDpr11 interactions, since both yDm8 and Tm5a projection neurons, which are also
selectively connected to yR7 PRs, express DIP-γ (Cosmanescu et al., 2018; Karuppudurai et

al., 2014). DIP-γ and Dpr11 are both required for normal morphogenesis of yDm8 distal
dendrites, which fasciculate with yR7 terminals and contain many of the R7-Dm8 synapses.

Given the existence of separate yellow and pale circuits, how does the system ensure that
each yR7 has a yDm8 partner? Here we show that DIP-γ-expressing yDm8 neurons are
generated in excess during development and compete for presynaptic yR7 partners. yR7
PRs and yDm8 neurons recognize each other using Dpr11- DIP-γ interactions. The
engagement of DIP-γ by Dpr11 is necessary for production of neurotrophic signals that
allow yDm8 neurons to survive.

RESULTS
Dm8 and R7 subtypes are present in matching ratios
DIP-γ interacts with four Dpr partners with similar affinities: Dprs 11, 15, 16 and 17
(Figure 1F). A subset of R7 PRs in pupal retina express the dpr11MiMIC GFP reporter
(henceforth denoted as dpr11GFP), and these were confirmed to be yR7 by co-labeling with a
Rh4 reporter (Figures 1B, D-E) (Carrillo et al., 2015). Reporters for Dprs 15, 16, and 17 are
not detectably expressed in the pupal retina. Here we classify two subtypes of Dm8
neurons, those which express DIP-γ (yDm8) and those which do not (pDm8) (Figure 1G-G’).
We determined the yDm8 population in the adult medullary cortex as those cells that
express RFP under the control of a late pupal pan-Dm8 driver and GFP from the DIP-γ MiMIC
GFP reporter (henceforth denoted as DIP-γ GFP). The pDm8 population was identified as
those cells that express RFP but not GFP; there are no known markers or drivers that
selectively label pDm8 neurons. For developmental studies, and to determine the yDm8
population without the driver, we used DIP-γ GFP together with the transcription factor
Dachshund (Dac), which is expressed in both y and pDm8 neurons (Figures 1GG’)(Hasegawa et al., 2011). Dac+, DIP-γ GFP+ cells are present from the beginning of pupal
development.

yR7 and pR7 ommatidia are present at a 65y:35p ratio, and because of retinotopy we
expect the same ratio of y and p columns in the medulla. We find that yDm8 and pDm8
neurons in wild-type are present at a ratio of 60y:40p, which is similar to the 65:35 ratio of
the input R7 PRs (Figures 1B, H) (Viets et al., 2016).

Dm8 neurons are both unicolumnar and multicolumnar in their coverage of columns in the
neuropil. The arbor of each Dm8 contacts 13-16 medulla columns, but most synapses are
made with the R7 in the central (home) column (Fischbach and Dittrich, 1989; Gao et al.,
2008; Takemura et al., 2013; Takemura et al., 2015). Figure 2A shows a horizontal view
(side-view as in Figure 1C) of a rendering of an R7 terminal and aDm8 arbor from an EM
reconstruction (Takemura et al., 2015). The thick bundle of dendritic processes at the
center of the arbor makes extensive contacts with the R7 home column, and contains the
majority of R7-Dm8 synapses (Figure 2A, Table 1). These central dendritic projections
extend distally from M6 to M4, and we have denoted them as the “sprig” of a Dm8 arbor.
The lateral arbor of each Dm8 overlaps extensively with other Dm8 arbors, but the center

of highest arbor density, the sprig, tiles the medulla. The coverage pattern of a typical Dm8
is thus indicative of approximately 1 cell per column.

Although the ratios of the input PRs and output targets match, the Dm8 cell numbers we
obtained (266 yDm8 and 179 pDm8) are insufficient for innervation of the expected 730785 yR7 plus pR7 columns in the medulla (Posnien et al., 2012) even when we account for
the fact that some Dm8 neurons (~6%; see below) have two home columns. This suggests
that the Dm8 driver is not completely penetrant. Indeed, when we use Dac and DIP-γGFP to
determine yDm8 populations, we obtain a larger number (~320), although this is still less
than the expected total number of yDm8 neurons, which is 440-480.

yDm8 selectively innervate yR7 in their home columns and avoid pR7
To evaluate the specificity of connections between Dm8 and R7 subtypes, we generated
single-cell Dm8 (flipout) clones. For yDm8 flipouts, we used a split-GAL4 driver that
includes a DIP-γ MiMIC GAL4-DBD hemi-driver to selectively label DIP-γ-expressing Dm8
(Figures 2B, D, Figure 2-figure supplement 1C-C’). For pDm8 flipouts, we used a pan-Dm8
driver (Nern et al., 2015) and Rh4-lacZ to identify clones whose home column R7 lacked
LacZ labeling, since there is no pDm8-specific driver (Figures 2C, E).

yDm8 and pDm8 arbors have similar morphologies, with the prominent dendritic sprig
identifying the home column (Figures 2A-C) (Gao et al., 2008; Nern et al., 2015). Using the
yDm8 split-GAL4 driver, we exclusively labeled Dm8 neurons that have yR7 as the home
column (43/43 flipouts; Figures 2B, D; Figure 2-figure supplement 1A). This indicates that

yDm8 specifically innervate yR7 and avoid pR7 in the home column. We also observed
yDm8 with two home columns at a frequency of ~6% (4/64 clones) (Figure 2-figure
supplement 1A). All four had both sprigs on yR7 columns. Since we find that all DIP-γpositive Dm8 neurons have yR7 home columns, we can infer that cells labeled using the
pan-Dm8 driver that have pR7 home columns must be the DIP-γ-negative pDm8 subtype.
Single cell clones of pDm8 were found to innervate only pR7 (21/72 total clones; one had
two pR7 home columns (Figures 2C, E, Figure 2-figure supplement 1A). Specificity was
further confirmed by labeling mid-pupal optic lobes with DIP-γ antibody and dpr11GFP. DIPγ labeling is seen in the M6 layer only under yR7 that co-express Dpr11 and Chaoptin (Chp)
and not under pR7 that are labeled with Chp alone (Figure 2F).

Outside of their home columns, yDm8 and pDm8 dendritic arbors contact both types of R7.
Cross-sectional (top-down) views of a yDm8 clone showed that it contacted 9 yR7 and 4
pR7, while a pDm8 contacted 5 yR7 and 10 pR7 (including their respective home columns)
(Figures 2D-E).

The two subtypes of Dm8 are distinguished by the expression of DIP-γ. To evaluate
whether the yDm8 and pDm8 populations have separate origins, we used DIP-γ-GAL4 to
express FLP in a line with a flipout cassette (LexAop-FRT-stop-FRT) driving a GFP reporter
and a pan-Dm8 LexA driver and examined M6 GFP labeling (Figure 2G, Figure 2-figure
supplement 1B).. If yDm8 and pDm8 originate as separate populations, we would expect
gaps to be present in M6 (like those seen with DIP-γGFP (Figure 2H’)), because the
conditional DIP-γ GFP reporter would be expressed only in yDm8. In an alternative model,

all Dm8 neurons would originate as a single DIP-γ+ population, but DIP-γ would remain on
only in those Dm8 that establish a stable contact with a Dpr11+ yR7. In the subset of Dm8
that form contacts with pR7, DIP-γ would be switched off. If the latter model were correct,
the conditional GFP reporter would be visualized as a continuous line in the M6 layer,
similar to that seen with a pan-Dm8 driver (Figure 2H”). Figure 2G and Figure 2-figure
supplement 1B show that there are gaps in the M6 layer, , indicating that the two Dm8
subtypes are in fact separate populations.

Yellow and pale-specific synaptic connections in color vision circuits
Most R7 output synapses are made onto Dm8, Dm9 (a multicolumnar medulla intrinsic
neuron), Tm5a, Tm5b, and Tm5c (Gao et al., 2008; Karuppudurai et al., 2014; Takemura et
al., 2013; Takemura et al., 2015). Tm5a/b/c neurons project to the lobula, and are likely to
be the main output neurons of R7 circuits. To define the synaptic connections of these
neurons and determine whether they differ between the y and p columns, we examined the

The morphologies of y and p R7 and Dm8 neurons, as visualized in the EM reconstruction,
do not allow us to distinguish their subtypes. However, the main dendritic branch of Tm5a
was found to associate with yR7 but not with pR7 axons in a light-level analysis
(Karuppudurai et al., 2014), suggesting that yR7 selectively synapses onto Tm5a. Using this
hypothesis as a guide, we identified five candidate yR7 PRs (in columns A, E, F, J, and K) and
three pR7 PRs (in columns Home, B and D) (Table 1). There are seven Dm8 neurons whose
home columns correspond to these eight R7 PRs (Dm8-B/home has two home columns).
Each R7 makes many more output synapses onto its home column Dm8 than onto other
Dm8 neurons, allowing us to identify B/home and D as pDm8, while A, E, F, J, and K are
yDm8 (Table 1). There is no apparent specificity in synaptic connectivity between y and p
R7 and Dm8 subtypes outside of the home column (Table 1-table supplement).

To analyze projection neuron input specificity, we counted synapses made by y and p R7
PRs onto Tm5a and Tm5b. The five yR7 make output synapses only onto Tm5a and not
Tm5b, which was the basis for their assignment as y (Karuppudurai et al., 2014). The three
pR7 synapse onto Tm5b and not Tm5a (Table 1). Thus, Tm5a and Tm5b represent separate
output channels for y (Rh4) and p (Rh3) inputs for this set of columns (see Table 1-table
supplement legend). Tm5a expresses DIP-γ, while Tm5b does not (Cosmanescu et al.,
2018). This suggests that the selective connection of yR7 to both yDm8 and Tm5a in the
home column might involve Dpr11-DIP-γ interactions. There are no GAL4 drivers that
distinguish between Tm5a and Tm5b, so we cannot determine if yR7-Tm5a connections
are altered in mutants.

Dm8 arbors contain both pre- and postsynaptic elements, and Dm8 is presynaptic to
Tm5a/b and Dm9. We find that Dm8 output synapses onto Tm5a/b have a similar
specificity to the R7 output synapses. Both pDm8 neurons almost exclusively synapse onto
Tm5b and not Tm5a, and four of the five yDm8 neurons (E, F, J and K) make more synapses
onto Tm5a than Tm5b (yDm8-A, however, makes ten synapses onto Tm5b-home and only
five onto Tm5a-A; Table 1). Each Dm9 receives input from both types of R7 and Dm8, and
makes output synapses onto multiple R7 neurons (Table 1-table supplement).

The entries in column1 indicate the column and y/p identities for each R7 and Dm8. The
entries in row 1 indicate the column and y/p identities for the Dm8, Tm5a, and Tm5b
neurons that are postsynaptic (and sometimes presynaptic) to the R7 and Dm8 neurons. In
each box, the x:y nomenclature indicates the numbers of output synapses and input
synapses. The layer in which most of these synapses are located is also indicated (M5 or
M6). At the bottom are maps of the arrangement of columns in the reconstruction, from
(Takemura et al., 2015), with y columns indicated in gold and p columns in blue in the
right-hand map. We could not assign y/p identities to columns C, P, or Q, and there are no
R7 outputs listed for the other columns. Tm5-C has an ambiguous morphology and could be
either a Tm5a or a Tm5b, and R7-P and R7-Q have no listed synapses onto Tm5a or b. Table

R7 synapses are polyadic, and Dm8 and Tm5a/b often sit together at synaptic sites. Figures
3F and G show R7 T-bars (active zone elements marking output synapses) adjacent to both
yDm8 and Tm5a, and pDm8 and Tm5b, respectively. In column E, the yR7-E axon terminal,
yDm8-E sprig, and Tm5a-E dendritic branch are tightly wrapped around each other
(Figures 3A, C). yR7-E T-bars are distributed in layers M4-M6, and are apposed to
postsynapses in the yDm8-E sprig and the distal dendritic branch of the Tm5a-E neuron
(Figure 3C). Most yDm8-E output synapses are onto Tm5a-E and Dm9 (Table 1, Table 1table supplement), and these are distributed between the sprig in M4-M5 and the main
arbor in M6 (Figure 3C and associated videos 1 and 2). The only pDm8 with one home
column in the reconstructed volume is pDm8-D. Although pDm8 usually have robust sprigs
(e.g., Figure 2C), pDm8-D has a very thin sprig, and most pR7-D and pDm8-D T-bars are in
M6 (Figure 3D and associated videos 3 and 4).

pR7-B, pR7-home, pDm8-B/home, Tm5b-B, and Tm5b-home form a two-home column
circuit (the individual cells of this circuit are shown in Figure 3-figure supplement 1). The B
sprig of pDm8-B/home and one of the dendritic branches of Tm5b-B are both wrapped
around the pR7-B terminal, while the pR7-home terminal is more loosely associated with
the home sprig of pDm8-B/home and dendritic branches of both Tm5b neurons (Figure 3E
and associated videos 5 and 6, and Figure 3-figure supplement 1). All pR7-B!Tm5b
synapses (14) and most pDm8-B/home!Tm5b synapses (30 vs. 4) are onto Tm5b-B. pR7home makes similar numbers of synapses onto Tm5b-B and Tm5b-home (Table 1).

Renderings of separated and combined cells from the EM reconstruction (Takemura et al.,
2015) are shown in (A)-(E). R7, magenta; Dm8, cyan; Tm5a/b, green.
(A) Cells in a yellow circuit, from column E. yR7-E, yDm8-E, and Tm5a-E are shown. yR7
inhibits both yDm8 and Tm5a (repression bars). yDm8 makes glutamatergic synapses
(probably excitatory) onto Tm5a (arrow). Tm5a and Tm5b axons project to the 5th layer of
the lobula. (B) Cells in a pale circuit, from column D. pR7-D, pDm8-D, and Tm5b-D are
shown. The connections among the cells are the same as for the yellow circuit. The
implication of these connection patterns is that R7 stimulation should inhibit Tm5a/b by
both direct (histaminergic) and indirect (histaminergic inhibition of excitatory Dm8
glutamatergic output) pathways.
(C)-(E) Renderings of R7-Dm8-Tm5a/b circuits. The insets show the home column region
where most synapses are located. Black balls, R7 T-bars; yellow balls, Dm8 T-bars. The
borders of M6, M5, and M4 are indicated. (C) The column E circuit. (D) The column D
circuit. (E) The column B and home circuit. This is a two-home column circuit, including
pR7-B, pR7-home, pDm8-B/home, Tm5b-B, and Tm5b-home. The separated cells for this
circuit are shown in Figure 3-figure supplement 1. See also associated videos 1-6 (vertical
and horizontal rotation of each circuit). For a comparison of an ExM image of a wild-type
yR7 and yDm8 to yR7-E and yDm8-E from the EM reconstruction, see Figure 5-figure
supplement 1.
(F) A section from column E, showing a polyadic synapse of yR7-E onto yDm8-E and Tm5aE. In (F) and (G), the R7 T-bars are the black shapes on the R7 membranes where they are
apposed to both postsynaptic cells. (G) A section from column D, showing a polyadic
synapse of pR7-D onto pDm8-D and Tm5b-D.
(H) A model for UV wavelength discrimination by the yellow and pale circuits. Short-wave
UV (red bar) would stimulate Rh3+ pR7 more than Rh4+ yR7, and might therefore produce
more inhibition of Tm5b than of Tm5a. Long-wave UV (blue bar) would produce more
inhibition of Tm5a than of Tm5b. These signals could be read out by Lo neurons that
receive Tm5a and Tm5b inputs.

DIP-γ and dpr11 mutations cause abnormalities in yDm8 dendritic arbors
If the yellow circuit is constructed using DIP-γ-Dpr11 interactions, as suggested by our
analysis of the EM reconstruction, one might expect that there would be abnormalities in
yDm8 arbors in DIP-γ and dpr11 mutants. To assess yDm8 arbor morphology in wholeanimal mutants, we surveyed horizontal views of the neuropil under conditions where we
genetically converted all Dm8 neurons to yDm8 (see below) (Figures 4B-D). Both mutants

displayed atypical patterns when labeled with the pan-Dm8 driver, with changes in the
regular pattern of sprigs extending upward along the home column R7.

We generated flipouts in wild-type and mutants (Figure 4-figure supplement 1A) and
examined arbor morphology (Figures 4E-G). The sprig, which is located in the center of the
arbor, usually has an expanded region at the distal end in M4/M5 (see Figures 2A-C). There
is a large variation in sprig diameter and height in both wild-type and mutants. Maximum
sprig diameter was significantly decreased in both DIP-γ and dpr11 mutants compared to
control, but the height of the sprig was relatively unaffected (Figures 4H-I).

yDm8 arbor morphology in detail
To obtain high-resolution views of interactions between yDm8 sprigs and R7 terminals, we
examined single cell yDm8 clones in wild-type and DIP-γ mutant brains using expansion
microscopy (ExM)(Figure 5 and associated videos 1-4) ((Mosca et al., 2017); reviewed by
(Karagiannis and Boyden, 2018)). The morphology of the arbor in M6 and of the sprig in
M4 and M5 can be visualized in detail in ExM images (Figure 5A). The sprig is on a home
column R7, where most of the synapses from yR7 to yDm8 are located (Figures 5B-C,
Figure 5-figure supplement 1). In addition to the sprig, this yDm8 arbor has two thin
dendritic processes that emerge from the base and are wrapped around neighboring non-

sprig, making multiple contacts with the base of the Dm8 arbor. DIP-γ mutant yDm8
neurons have thinner sprigs, in agreement with our quantitative analysis of mutant flipout

Interaction between Dpr11 in yR7 and DIP-γ in yDm8 is required for yDm8 survival
We previously showed that Dm8 cells are lost in DIP-γ GFP/Df animals (Carrillo et al 2015).
To explore this in detail, we used CRISPR-generated null mutants for both DIP-γ and dpr11
(Xu et al., 2018b) and determined yDm8 and pDm8 populations (Figures 6A-C). DIP-γ GFP,
which has no detectable protein expression, was used as one of the DIP-γ alleles to allow
identification of yDm8 soma. Both DIP-γ and dpr11 mutants showed a ~50% decrease in
yDm8 cell number using the pan-Dm8 driver and 60-65% loss when determined with Dac
(Figures 6A, C). The loss of yDm8 in DIP-γ mutants was partially rescued by expressing a
DIP-γ transgene using the DIP-γ Gal4 driver (Figure 6A). To determine if yDm8 loss in dpr11
mutants was due to the absence of Dpr11 from the eye or from other Dpr11-expressing
cells in the medulla, we performed eye-specific dpr11 transgenic RNAi, and found a ~40%
reduction in yDm8 cell numbers (Figure 6C).

We also ectopically expressed DIP-γ in PRs, and found that this phenocopied the DIP-γ and
dpr11 loss-of-function (LOF) phenotypes (Figure 6C). This result suggests that the presence
of both Dpr11 and its partner on the same cells (expression in cis) prevents Dpr11 in yR7
from interacting with DIP-γ in trans (on yDm8). Similar results were observed for DIP-α
and Dpr10 in the neuromuscular system, where DIP-α is normally expressed on the RP2

motoneuron and Dpr10 on its muscle targets. LOF mutants lacking either protein are
missing specific muscle branches, and ectopic expression of DIP-α on muscles, or of Dpr10
on RP2, generates the same phenotypes (Ashley et al., 2019).

To assess whether the decrease in yDm8 population was due to apoptotic cell death, we
expressed Drosophila inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (DIAP) in DIP-γ expressing cells
(Figure 6-figure supplement 1). DIAP overexpression rescued the loss of yDm8 in DIP-γ
mutants, indicating that DIP-γ is required for cell survival and that yDm8 undergo
apoptosis when it is absent (Figure 6A). Furthermore, the number of yDm8 that survived
when DIAP was expressed was ~45% greater than the number of yDm8 present in
controls. It has been reported that extensive cell death occurs in the medullary cortex in
wild-type during normal optic lobe development (Togane et al., 2012). Thus, in addition to
the yDm8 that were rescued from cell death caused by the absence of DIP-γ, DIAP also
rescued yDm8 that were lost due to normal developmental cell death (see Discussion). The
fact that dpr11 and DIP-γ mutants displayed a similar extent of yDm8 loss implies that
Dpr11 in yR7 signals to yDm8 via DIP-γ to ensure their survival, implicating yR7 as a source
of neurotrophic support for yDm8. Absence of either molecule compromises the interaction
and leads to death of yDm8 neurons.

We next assessed pDm8 populations in the above genotypes and found that in general they
did not differ significantly from controls. Importantly, pDm8 cell numbers did not decrease
when the yDm8 population was increased by DIAP rescue (Figure 6B; see below).

We also visualized the M6 layer using the DIP-γ GFP reporter, and found that morphologies
of the yDm8 layer in the above genotypes were consistent with the results obtained in the
cortex. In the neuropil, larger gaps were observed in the mutants, and fewer and smaller
gaps in wild-type and rescue genotypes (Figures 6D-H).

DIP-γ mutants also displayed a ~4.5-fold higher frequency of two-home column flipouts as
compared to control (Figure 4-figure supplement 1). The increase in two-home column
yDm8 may be a response strategy in which the surviving yDm8 innervate more yR7 in
order to compensate for the loss of neurotrophic support mediated by DIP-γ.

between 15h APF and 25h APF. yDm8 cell numbers in DIP-γ mutants are similar to wildtype cell numbers at 15h APF, but there is significant cell death by 25h APF. By 45h APF,
the yDm8 population in both wild type and mutant had reached the adult cell number. DIAP
rescue of the DIP-γ mutant restored the population in the adult back to the original pool
size at 15h APF (Figure 7A). Thus, DIP-γ is required for suppression of yDm8 cell death
early in pupal development. Extensive migration of yDm8 cells was observed in wild-type,
and this migration was unaffected in the DIP-γ mutant (Figures 7B-D, and data not shown).

In order for the interaction to occur, yR7 and its target yDm8 have to be in close proximity,
and Dpr11 and DIP-γ need to be expressed. We found that dpr11 was expressed in select R7
at 15h APF, suggesting that the yellow fate of R7 was determined by that time (Figure 7E).
We next examined DIP-γ expression in early pupa and found DIP-γ labeling adjacent to
select R7 at 20h APF, indicating that yDm8 arbors are apposed to yR7 terminals (Figure
7F). The gaps in DIP-γ labeling are presumed to be pDm8 (Figure 7-figure supplement 1).
Taken together, our results are consistent with a model in which selection of yDm8 by yR7
occurs by 15h-20h APF via Dpr11-DIP-γ binding and thereby ensures survival of yDm8.

Perturbing R7 fate in the retina alters Dm8 fate in the medulla
Since Dpr11 is expressed in yR7 PRs, we next examined how the two subtypes of Dm8
neurons respond when R7 fates are altered. The transcription factor Spineless (Ss) controls
yellow and pale subtype choice in the retina. Ectopic expression of ss in all PRs (ssGOF)
induces yellow fate in all R7 cells and prevents formation of pR7 (Wernet et al., 2006). We
first determined Dpr11 and DIP-γ expression in ssGOF. In contrast to wild-type, where only
yR7 is labeled by dpr11GFP, all R7 terminals showed GFP expression when ss was misexpressed (Figures 8A-B). Thus, Ss expression activates Dpr11 along with Rh4 and other
yR7-specific genes. The normal gaps in DIP-γGFP labeling in the M6 layer were missing in

ssGOF. When DIP-γ was removed in the ssGOF background, gaps were again observed in the
yDm8 layer, indicating that the M6 signal in ssGOF is indeed due to DIP-γ-expressing yDm8
(Figure 8-figure supplement 1A-C). The change in R7 fate is thus transmitted to the
downstream circuit in the medulla via Dpr11-DIP-γ interactions, resulting in uniform yDm8
labeling in the M6 layer.

We determined yDm8 and pDm8 cell number in the above genotypes (Figures 8C-D). In
ssGOF, we observed a 36% increase in yDm8, while pDm8 cell number was decreased by
84%. The increase in yDm8 in ssGOF was dependent on DIP-γ, as absence of DIP-γ in the ssGOF
background resulted in 53% loss of yDm8 neurons. Interestingly, pDm8 increased
significantly, doubling their cell numbers as compared to ssGOF alone (Figure 8D). Thus,
yDm8 and pDm8 populations compete with each other when R7 fate is altered, as observed
in ssGOF.

To assess Dm8 subtypes in the reverse situation where there are only pR7 in the eye, we
ectopically expressed the Defective proventriculus (Dve) transcription factor, a repressor
downstream of ss, in all PRs (Johnston et al., 2011; Nakagawa et al., 2011; Yan et al., 2017).
We used this strategy because ss LOF mutations cause lethality and we observed no
phenotype with eye-specific ss RNAi. We predicted that there would be fewer yDm8
neurons in dveGOF, as there are no yR7 to provide neurotrophic support. Since the external
eye morphologies of these animals were abnormal, we initially examined the neuropil
layers of the medulla. Except for the DIP-γGFP labeling in M6, other layers of the neuropil
showed similar patterns to wild-type. The M6 layer had large gaps, similar to those

observed in DIP-γ mutants, suggesting that there were fewer yDm8 neurons (Figure 8figure supplement 1E). Indeed, yDm8 cell number decreased by ~60% as compared to the
control (Figure 8G).

Sevenless is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is required for specification of R7 in the
developing eye. In sev mutants, R7 is absent, because the R7 precursor cell becomes a nonneuronal cone cell. We found that both the yDm8 and pDm8 populations were reduced in
sev mutants by >70% as compared to control cell numbers, showing that both classes of
Dm8 depend on R7 PRs for neurotrophic support. yDm8 cell numbers were further
reduced when DIP-γ was removed in the sev mutant background (Figure 8C). This
dependence on DIP-γ likely occurs because there are a few Dpr11-expressing R7 remaining
in the sev mutant (Figure 8-figure supplement 1F), although the allele we used is described
as an amorph. The ~50 yDm8 that remain in a sev DIP-γ double mutant may not require
trophic support for survival, or might obtain support through a different pathway.
pDm8 numbers are slightly increased by removal of DIP-γ in the sev mutant background.
This is probably because they are competing with yDm8 for the few remaining R7 PRs, so
that the loss of additional yDm8 through removal of DIP-γ frees up those slots to be
occupied by pDm8.

In order to complete our analysis of the consequences of changing R7 fates, we examined
ectopic expression of Dpr11 in the eye (dpr11GOF). We reasoned that since dpr11 was
expressed in all R7 in ssGOF (Figure 8B), Dpr11 overexpression in the eye should mimic
ssGOF. Indeed, the M6 layer showed continuous yDm8 labeling with no pDm8 gaps, similar

to ssGOF (Figure 8-figure supplement 1D). This was confirmed by determining yDm8 and
pDm8 cell numbers in dpr11GOF. The yDm8 population increased by 53% over control when
Dpr11 was overexpressed in all PRs, accompanied by a 67% loss of pDm8 (Figures 8C-D).
Dpr11 overexpression in dpr11GOF was confirmed by labeling with Dpr11 antibody. Dpr11
overexpression does not convert pR7 to the yR7 fate, because R7 PRs that ectopically
express Dpr11 do not all express Rh4 (Figure 8-figure supplement 1G-I).

We next examined cross-sectional (top-down) views of the mid-pupal medulla in dpr11GOF
labeled with DIP-γ and Chp antibodies to assess the composition of Dm8 columns when
Dpr11 is expressed in all R7 PRs. Wild-type controls showed 62y:38p columns in the
medulla, similar to the 65y:35p ratio of yellow and pale ommatidia in the eye. By contrast,
in dpr11GOF only yellow columns were observed, indicating that all pDm8 home columns
had been replaced by yDm8 (Figures 8E-F). Thus~35% of yDm8 neurons had now selected
PRs that express Dpr11 but were otherwise of the p subtype as their home column R7
(Figure 8H, Figure 8-figure supplement 1I). Similar results were obtained in ssGOF, in which
pR7 PRs are actually converted to the y subtype (Figure 8-figure supplement 1J).

yDm8 do not mistarget to pR7 in dpr11 mutants
Since ectopic expression of Dpr11 in all PRs changed the identities of home column Dm8,
converting them all to yDm8 (Figures 8E-F, H), we investigated whether there were defects
in home column selection in dpr11 mutants. We examined mutants and heterozygous
controls at 44h APF because Dm8 have not yet contacted neighboring columns at this stage,
making it possible to unambiguously assign the home column (Ting et al., 2014). y and p R7

were identified using dpr11GFP and Chp antibody. Using the DIP-γ antibody to label yDm8,
we determined how many yR7 containing columns were paired with yDm8. In controls,
every yR7 column had DIP-γ labeling adjacent to it. In dpr11 mutants, there was a
significantly higher percentage of unpaired yR7 as compared to controls (Figure 8-figure
supplement 2C). However, this result can be explained by the fact that yDm8 die in dpr11
mutants, so that the number of surviving yDm8 neurons is insufficient to innervate all yR7.
Thus, the absence of DIP-γ labeling adjacent to yR7 does not indicate that Dpr11 is required
for home column selection. We found no mistargeting errors where pR7 containing
columns labeled only with Chp were apposed to yDm8 in dpr11 mutants (Figure 8-figure
supplement 2A-B). However, pR7 may not be available as targets because they would have
been selected by pDm8 neurons. The fact that pR7 are occupied by pDm8 in mutants makes
it difficult to assess whether Dpr11-DIP-γ interactions are required for selection of yDm8 as
targets by yR7.

DISCUSSION
A circuit for UV wavelength discrimination in Drosophila is defined by expression of a pair
of cell-surface IgSF binding partners, Dpr11 and DIP-γ. Dpr11 is selectively expressed by
Rh4+ yR7 PRs (Figure 1), which connect to the yDm8 subtype of Dm8 amacrine neurons
that express DIP-γ. Rh3+ pR7 connect to the pDm8 subtype, which is DIP-γ negative (Figure
2). yR7 and yDm8 synapse onto Tm5a neurons, which also express DIP-γ and project to the
lobula (Figure 3 and associated videos), while pR7 and pDm8 synapse onto Tm5b. Dpr11DIP-γ interactions are also involved in determination of Dm8 arbor morphology (Figures 4,
5 and associated videos). yDm8 neurons are generated in excess during development and
compete for yR7 partners. Their survival is controlled by neurotrophic signaling mediated
by transsynaptic Dpr11-DIP-γ interactions (Figures 6, 7). yDm8 and pDm8 neurons do not
normally compete for survival signals, but can be forced to do so by changing R7 subtype
fate (Figure 8).

Control of R7-Dm8 connectivity by neurotrophic Dpr11-DIP-γ signaling
Yellow and pale ommatidia are generated by a stochastic process and are distributed in a
~65y:35p ratio in the retina (Wernet et al., 2006). Since yDm8 and pDm8 are separate
populations (Figure 2) and R7 y vs. p fates are randomly determined, what mechanisms
ensure that each yDm8 has a yR7 partner and each pDm8 has a pR7 partner? The strategy
appears similar to those used in the development of many mammalian nervous system
circuits, in that yDm8 neurons are generated in excess of their final cell numbers in adults,

and those that are not selected for survival by an appropriate home column R7 partner die
through apoptosis.

Our conclusions are summarized in a model (Figure 9). There are two subtypes of Dm8:
yDm8 that express DIP-γ and pDm8 that do not. yDm8 are born in excess of the final cell
numbers that are present in the adult (Figure 7A). There are likely to be extra pDm8 as
well, but due to the lack of a pDm8 marker we were unable to determine their cell numbers
in early pupae. Dpr11, the binding partner of DIP-γ, is expressed exclusively in yR7 in the
retina (Figures 1D-E), allowing yDm8 neurons to select yR7 PRs as their appropriate
partners. The extra yDm8 that do not find a yR7 partner undergo cell death due to lack of
neurotrophic support. This selection mechanism ensures that the ratio of yDm8 to pDm8 in
the medulla matches the ratio of yR7 to pR7 in the eye (Figure 1H).

Dpr11 and DIP-γ are required for survival, because 50-60% of yDm8 die when either
molecule is absent (Figures 6, 7A, 9). If all R7 are converted to yR7 (in ssGOF), or if they all
express Dpr11, many more yDm8 neurons survive than in wild-type, showing that the
numbers of Dpr11-expressing R7 are limiting for yDm8 survival in wild-type animals
(Figures 8C, 9). This seems surprising, because a wild-type retina should contain 460-500
yR7 (Posnien et al., 2012), which is greater than the number of yDm8 we count in early
pupae (Figure 7A). However, the actual yDm8 cell numbers may be larger due to
incomplete penetrance of the markers, as discussed in Results.

yDm8 and pDm8 populations do not compete with each other in wild-type because they
have different R7 partners. When the numbers of yDm8 neurons are increased by
suppressing apoptotic cell death with DIAP in yDm8, pDm8 cell numbers do not decrease
(Figure 6B). However, yDm8 and pDm8 neurons can be forced to compete by changing R7
subtype fate. When all R7 PRs are converted to yR7, or when they all express Dpr11, almost
all pDm8 neurons die (Figures 8D, 9). Conversely, most yDm8 neurons die when all R7 PRs
are converted to pR7 (in dveGOF)(Figure 8G).

pDm8 neurons are preferentially selected by pR7 PRs, using unknown molecular
mechanisms, and pR7 PRs are needed to ensure pDm8 survival. This is demonstrated by
the fact that pDm8 are unable to effectively fill vacant yR7 slots. For example, in ssGOF, DIP-γ
animals, there are at least 180 yR7 slots that are made vacant by loss of yDm8, but the
number of pDm8 neurons only increases by ~30 (~2-fold) in this genotype (Figures 8C-D).

Figure 9: Model for Dm8 selection and survival.
(A) In wild-type, yDm8 neurons (red) are produced in excess and are selected by yR7 PRs
for connectivity and survival. pDm8 neurons (blue) are also shown as being generated in
excess, and we have indicated their cell numbers prior to selection as being the same as
yDm8, but this is arbitrary, since we do not know how many pDm8 are born. Unselected
yDm8 and pDm8 neurons die in the absence of neurotrophic support (indicated by Xs).
~30% of the yDm8 neurons present at 15h APF die in wild-type (Figure 7A).
(B) When all R7 PRs are converted to yR7 (in ssGOF) or when they all express Dpr11, more
yDm8 neurons survive and almost all pDm8 neurons die (Figure 8).
(C) In DIP-γ mutants, yDm8 neurons are not selected by yR7 PRs and more of them die.
~75% of the yDm8 neurons present at 15h APF die in DIP-γ mutants (Figure 7A). Similar
results are observed for dpr11 mutants. This means that some yR7 PRs remain
uninnervated (Figure 6-figure supplement 2).
__________________________________________________________________________________________________
Selection of yDm8 neurons for survival occurs early, prior to synaptogenesis
Dpr11 is already expressed in a subset of R7 PRs at 15h APF, indicating that yR7 fate is
determined by that time (Figure 7E). DIP-γ is expressed by 18h-20h APF in select Dm8
neurons apposed to Dpr11-expressing R7 PRs (Figure 7F; Figure 7-figure supplement 1AB). At this time, R7 growth cones are positioned in the incipient layer (Kulkarni et al., 2016;
Ting et al., 2005). This is consistent with earlier findings that single-cell Dm8 clones contact
home column R7 growth cones by 17h APF (Ting et al., 2014). Taken together, these results
indicate that yR7 and yDm8 have met and selected each other in the incipient layer by 15h20h APF. Neurotrophic signaling mediated by Dpr11-DIP-γ interactions is probably
initiated around that time, because cell death of yDm8 in DIP-γ mutants begins to occur
between 15 hr and 25 hr APF (Figure 7A).

There is widespread cell death in the medullary cortex as part of normal optic lobe
development. This occurs in two phases, with the first phase spanning 0h-48h APF and
peaking at 24h APF (Togane et al., 2012). In wild-type, ~30% of the yDm8 neurons present

at 15 h APF die by 45h APF, at which time yDm8 cell numbers are the same as those in
adult. In DIP-γ mutants, ~75% are lost by 45h APF. If apoptotic cell death is suppressed by
DIAP, then the yDm8 population in adult remains the same as at 15h APF (Figure 7A). We
suggest that the yDm8 neurons that die in wild-type are those that are in excess of the
number that can be selected for survival by Dpr11-expressing yR7 PRs. Since most yDm8
neurons require DIP-γ for survival, we infer that the excess yDm8 neurons in wild-type die
because they lack neurotrophic support mediated by Dpr11-DIP-γ interactions. However,
we do not understand why yDm8 neurons begin to die earlier in DIP-γ mutants than in
wild-type (Figure 7A). Perhaps DIP-γ not engaged by Dpr11 (which would be present in
wild-type yDm8) allows cells to survive longer than when DIP-γ is absent. These selection
events are independent of synaptogenesis between R7 and Dm8, which occurs only after
60h APF.

The DIP-α-expressing Dm4 neurons are also generated in excess, and their survival is
regulated by interactions between DIP-α and its partners Dprs 6 and 10, which are
expressed on presynaptic L3 neurons. In DIP-α or dpr6 dpr10 mutants, about 50% of Dm4
and 20% of Dm12 neurons are lost. If cell death is blocked in wild-type, the cell numbers of
Dm4 neurons in adults are increased by about 25% (Xu et al., 2018b). Thus, in these cases
Dpr-DIP interactions play a similar role in suppressing cell death of postsynaptic neurons
in the distal medulla. However, not all DIP-γ expressing neurons in the optic lobe require it
for survival. A subset of lobula plate tangential cells (LPTCs) also express DIP-γ, and these
do not die in DIP-γ mutants (unpublished data).

Our gain-of-function studies show that when Dpr11 is expressed in all R7, all pDm8 home
columns are converted to yDm8 (Figures 8E-F, H), demonstrating that expression of Dpr11
in R7 PRs that are otherwise of the pale subtype is sufficient for selection of yDm8.
However, we were unable to determine whether Dpr11 is also necessary for yDm8-yR7
pairing by analysis of LOF mutants. We did not observe mistargeting of surviving yDm8 in
dpr11 mutants to pR7 columns, most likely because pR7 slots are occupied by pDm8
neurons (Figure 8-figure supplement 2A-C). Another factor that could contribute to
accurate targeting in dpr11 mutants is that there may be a second mechanism for support
(and possibly selection) of yDm8 by R7 that is independent of Dpr11-DIP-γ interactions.
This is suggested by the fact that ~70% of yDm8 are lost in sev mutants, but only ~50% in
DIP-γ and dpr11 mutants (Figures 8C, 6A).

Effects of DIP-γ and dpr11 mutations on yDm8 arbor morphology
A typical wild-type yDm8 arbor has a thick distal dendritic projection (sprig) that extends
along the home column yR7 terminal, usually reaching M4. In DIP-γ and dpr11 mutants, the
distribution of sprig diameters for yDm8 neurons is shifted toward smaller values (Figure
4H), suggesting that mutant sprigs may have a reduced capacity to form synapses with yR7
in M4 and M5. Synapses that would have been in M4 and M5 might then be found in the
base of the arbor in M6. EM reconstruction data for columns D and E supports this idea. R7
output synapses (T-bars) are mainly in M4 and M5 (on the sprig) in column E, which has a
Dm8 with a thick sprig (Figures 2A, 3A, inset in 3C). In column D, whose Dm8 has a very
thin sprig, R7 T-bars are located in M6 (in the main arbor) (Figures 3B, inset in 3D).

The effects of Dpr11 and DIP-γ on yDm8 sprig morphology may involve a different pathway
from that involved in cell death. Although cell death would have occurred in the DIP-γ and
dpr11 mutant animals, these flipouts were analyzed in adults, in which the population has
stabilized and the remaining yDm8 neurons are not in the process of dying. Sprig
morphology defects might be a consequence of a loss of Dpr11-DIP-γ-mediated adhesion
between yR7 and yDm8, since dpr11 and DIP-γ mutants are similarly affected.

We had earlier reported an “overshoot” phenotype in dpr11GFP/Df mutants in which some
R7 terminals had processes extending beyond M6 into proximal medulla layers(Carrillo et
al., 2015). Overshoots were labeled by an overexpressed truncated form (Brp-short) of the
active zone protein Bruchpilot (Brp)(Berger-Muller et al., 2013). However, this phenotype
was not observed in the dpr11CRISPR null mutant when endogenous Brp puncta were labeled
with the STaR method (Xu et al., 2018b). To determine whether this discrepancy was due
to the dpr11GFP/Df genotype or to the Brp-short marker, we analyzed dpr11CRISPR
homozygotes using Brp-short and observed a significant increase in yR7 overshoots as
compared with the heterozygous control (Figure 8-figure supplement 2D). However, the
interpretation of this Brp-short phenotype is unclear, as it does not correspond to a shift in
the distribution of endogenous Brp puncta into layers proximal to M6.

A circuit for wavelength discrimination defined by Dpr11 and DIP-γ expression
Tm5a, Tm5b, and Tm5c are output neurons for R7 and R8 circuits. Their dendrites receive
direct synaptic input from R7, R8, and Dm8, and their axons relay signals to the lobula (Gao
et al., 2008; Karuppudurai et al., 2014; Takemura et al., 2013; Takemura et al., 2015). It has

been hypothesized that Tm5a/b/c cells are analogous to vertebrate retinal ganglion cells,
and that true color vision (intensity-independent hue discrimination) involves
interpretation of Tm inputs by circuits in the lobula. Chi-Hon Lee and his colleagues
developed a learning paradigm in which flies discriminate between equiluminant blue and
green light, which are differentially sensed by y (Rh6) and p (Rh5) R8. Four classes of Tm
neurons (Tm5 a/b/c and Tm20) make redundant contributions to this response (Melnattur
et al., 2014).

The absorption spectra of Rh4 (yR7) and Rh3 (pR7) extensively overlap (Figure 3H), and it
is unlikely that a learned color vision paradigm could be developed that would distinguish
between Rh4 and Rh3 inputs. Nevertheless, the existence of discrete y and p R7 channels
suggests that the fly utilizes them to make discriminations among UV wavelength inputs.
To make such discriminations would require that the y and p channels have different
synaptic circuits with distinguishable outputs. Our analysis of the patterns of synaptic
connections defined by the EM reconstruction of the medulla (Takemura et al., 2013;
Takemura et al., 2015) indicates that yR7 and yDm8 both preferentially synapse onto
Tm5a, while pR7 and pDm8 synapse onto Tm5b (Table 1). Tm5a expresses DIP-γ, while
Tm5b does not (Cosmanescu et al., 2018), so Dpr11-DIP-γ interactions might be involved in
specifying both yR7-yDm8 and yR7-Tm5a connections. Four of the seven Dm8 neurons,
and three of the eight R7 PRs, also make a few synapses onto Tm5c neurons, which are
required for innate UV preference (Karuppudurai et al., 2014)(Table 1-table supplement).
There is no specificity for y vs. p in the connections to Tm5c.

We visualized yR7-yDm8-Tm5a (yellow) and pR7-pDm8-Tm5b (pale) circuits using 3D
renderings of cells from the EM reconstruction (Takemura et al., 2015)(Figures 3A-E and
associated videos). The yDm8-E sprig and Tm5a-E dendritic branch are both wrapped
tightly around the yR7-E terminal, and most yR7 T-bars are apposed to the sprig and
branch within layer M5. Dm8 arbors contain both pre- and postsynaptic elements, and
therefore both receive inputs and emit outputs. yDm8-E T-bars are distributed between the
sprig and the main arbor in M6 (Figure 3C). Remarkably, our 3D renderings of wild-type
yDm8 and yR7 neurons from ExM (Figure 5 and associated videos) are almost
superimposable on yDm8-E and yR7-E from the EM reconstruction (Figure 5-figure
supplement 1). This allows us to interpret yDm8 ExM phenotypes in DIP-γ mutants (Figure
5, Figure 5-figure supplement 2) by reference to the EM reconstruction.

R7 is histaminergic, and inhibits both Dm8 and Tm5a/b (Figures 3A-B), usually through
polyadic synapses where a single R7 T-bar is apposed to both a Dm8 and a Tm5a/b
postysnapse (Figures 3F-G). Dm8 is glutamatergic, while Tm5a and Tm5b are cholinergic
(Davis et al., 2018; Gao et al., 2008; Karuppudurai et al., 2014). This suggests that yR7 input
might cause inhibition of Tm5a in two ways: by direct inhibition and by inhibiting the
glutamatergic input (probably excitatory) of yDm8 onto Tm5a. Conversely, pR7 input could
preferentially inhibit Tm5b by both direct and indirect mechanisms. There might be timing
differences between direct and indirect inhibition.

UV inputs will always stimulate both y and pR7 channels, because the Rh4 and Rh3
absorption maxima differ by only 20 nm. However, longer-wave inputs that activate Rh4 on

yR7 more than Rh3 on pR7 might cause more inhibition of Tm5a than of Tm5b, while the
reverse would be true of shorter-wave inputs that preferentially activate Rh3 on pR7
(Figure 3H). Combining direct (R7!Tm5a/b) and indirect (R7!Dm8!Tm5a/b) inhibition
of Tm5a and Tm5b outputs might amplify these effects, depending on the relative timing of
R7 and Dm8 inputs. This model suggests that neurons in the lobula or elsewhere that can
read the ratio of Tm5a to Tm5b output mediate UV wavelength discrimination. Tm5a/b/c
and Tm20 as a group synapse onto many lobula neuron types, but the specific partners of
Tm5a and Tm5b are mostly unknown. Interestingly, however, all Tm5a but only half of
Tm5b neurons synapse onto LT11 lobula projection neurons (Lin et al., 2016). Flies with
silenced LT11 neurons have reduced phototaxis toward blue light (Otsuna et al., 2014).

In conclusion, our results show that Dpr11 and DIP-γ expression patterns define a yR7yDm8-Tm5a circuit that should preferentially respond to longer-wavelength UV input.
Neurotrophic signaling triggered by engagement of Dpr11 on yR7 by DIP-γ on yDm8 helps
to build this circuit by ensuring that each yDm8 has a home column yR7.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Drosophila genetics:
Heterozygote controls were used in all experiments for determining cell numbers. DIP-γ GFP
reporter (indicated in all graphs as DIP-γ -/+) is an insertion in the 5’ UTR intron and has
reduced or no protein expression. Thus, this line serves as a mutant as well as a reporter of
DIP-γ transcript.
For eye-specific transgenic RNAi, we screened 3 dpr11 RNAi lines by crossing to a line
which had one copy of dpr11 removed to increase the effectiveness of the RNAi line: lGMRGal4; dpr11null, DIP-γ MI03222-GFP. GD2343 (VDRC) had the strongest phenotype and was used
in the paper.

Generation of UAS-transgenic flies
cDNA encoding Dpr11 and DIP-γ were cloned from pOT2 GH22307 for Dpr11 and pOT2
GH08175 for DIP-γ into pUAST attB vector using standard molecular biology techniques. 5’
UTRs for both genes contained many upstream ATG codons; we made deletions of the 5’
UTRs so that the ATGs of the proteins were the first ATGs in the mRNAs, in order to
increase expression of the transgenes (sequences available on request). Transgenes were

injected into embryos (Rainbow transgenics). UAS-Dpr11 and UAS-DIP-γ both used the
attP40 (2L) landing site.
Antibodies
The primary antibodies used were as follows: anti-DIP-γ (guinea pig, 1:200) and anti-Dpr11
(rabbit, 1:150) were gifts from C. Desplan. Anti-Pros MR1A (mouse 1:4), anti-Elav 7E8A10
(rat, 1:10), anti-Dac 2-3 (mouse 1:50), anti-chaoptin 24B10 (mouse 1:20) were obtained
from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (University of Iowa, IA). Commercial
antibodies were used as follows: Rabbit anti-RFP (Rockland, 1:500), rabbit anti-GFP
(Thermo fisher Scientific, 1:500), chicken anti-GFP (Aves labs, 1:500), mouse anti-myc
9E10 (Abcam, 1:500) and chicken anti-beta-galactosidase (Abcam, 1:1000). Secondary
antibodies were obtained from Thermo-fisher Scientific and used at 1:500.
Immunohistochemistry
Eclosed flies (less than 3-days old) were dissected in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS with 0.2% Triton-X-100 (PBT) for 20 min at room
temperature. Brains were washed overnight in PBT, followed by a two-day incubation at
40C with primary antibody that was diluted in blocking buffer (5% normal goat serum in
PBT). Samples were then incubated with secondary antibody (similarly diluted in blocking
buffer) for two-days, followed by washing with PBT and PBS and stored in Vectashield.
For single cell flipouts, brains were given heat-shock at 50h APF for 10-20 min at 370C and
1-day eclosed flies were dissected for staining as above.

For cell counts and column analyses, optic lobes were separated from the central brain and
mounted top-down. Confocal images were acquired on Zeiss LSM800 or LSM700
microscopes with a 40xobjective. For cell counts and single-cell flipouts, optic lobes were
imaged with 1.5µm and 0.8 µm z-sections, respectively. Single slices or maximum intensity
projections were exported with Zen software (Zeiss) for image processing.
Image processing
Images were processed with Adobe Photoshop.
Quantitation and Statistics
Cell numbers were determined blind to genotype using Zen software to do manual counts.
For all data (cell soma, columns and Brp overshoots), only 1 optic lobe per animal was used
for counts and statistics. P-value was determined using Student’s unpaired t-test from
Graphpad Prism. All data reported in graphs are mean +/- standard deviation.
yDm8 sprig parameters were measured using ImageJ software. To obtain measurement of
the widest point of a sprig, a slice at which the image was most in focus was selected. The
height was measured from the most distal point of the sprig to its most proximal point
before the processes of the sprig connected back to the dendritic base. The Brp overshoots
were analyzed blind using ImageJ software, by an individual unrelated to that experiment.
ExM method
Single cell flipouts were processed for expansion microscopy after immunohistochemistry
(and confirming the presence of flipouts) according to a protocol from Tim Mosca , based
on (Mosca et al., 2017). Briefly, labeled brains were washed in 50% PBT-PBS mixture

before proceeding with steps for anchoring proteins to the sodium acrylate matrix. Gelling
chambers were made on coated slides with No.1 coverslips as bridge and brains were
embedded in sodium acrylate gel. After incubation for 2 hours at 370C, the samples were
excised from the solidified gel and processed for digestion with proteinase K in 6-well
plates. Gel fragments were expanded by replacing the digestion buffer with several washes
of water. Finally, in preparation for confocal imaging, the gel fragments containing the
expanded transparent brains were placed on a 24mm x 50mm No.1.5 coverslip that was
coated with poly-l-lysine. Preps were always covered in water to make sure they did not
dry out during imaging. Expanded brains were imaged on Zeiss LSM800 with 40x Objective
1.1 NA.
3D reconstruction of ExM samples
ExM images were processed for 3D reconstruction using Imaris software (Bitplane). Using
surface rendering and fluorescence thresholding, we were able to obtain an accurate 3D
structure of a yDm8 in wild-type and DIP-γ mutant. Each channel was recreated by adding
an additional surface. The threshold for new surface detection was set as needed per image
minimizing the addition of surface fragments not present in the original image. Each new
surface was segmented in order to isolate the appropriate region of interest. Video
recordings were captured at 10 frames per second for a total of 300 frames.

Table 1-table supplement
A table listing non-home column R7 synapses, and R7/Dm8 synapses with Tm5c and Dm9,
in addition to the information in Table 1. Column 2 indicates the identities of the input
synapses from R7 onto each Dm8. The reconstructed volume is unlikely to cover the entire
arbor of these Dm8 neurons, since each Dm8 can contact 13-16 R7 (Gao et al., 2008).
However, column 2 shows that within the reconstructed columns there is no apparent
specificity in synaptic connectivity between y and p R7 and Dm8 neurons outside of their
home columns. For example, pDm8-B/home receives synapses from 4 non-home column
R7, at least 2 of which are yR7, while yDm8-A receives synapses from 2 non-home column
pR7 and a yR7. Even the Dm8 at the center of the reconstruction (Dm8-B/home) only
receives synapses from 4 non-home column R7 PRs, so many Dm8 contacts with R7
columns may not be associated with input synapses from R7. Also note that (Karuppudurai
et al., 2014) found that Tm5a dendrites specifically associate with yR7 axons, but they
stated that Tm5b dendrites have no specificity for association with y vs. p R7 axons. Our
analysis of the EM reconstruction, however, shows that all 3 pR7 PRs synapse only onto
Tm5b and not Tm5a. The conclusion of (Karuppudurai et al., 2014) likely arises from the
fact that Tm5b usually has 2 distal dendritic projections. One of these always arborizes
with a pR7 axon and receives the pR7 input. The other one can arborize with either a y or a
p R7, but does not receive yR7 input, at least not for this set of columns. Four of the 7 Dm8,
and 3 of the 8 R7 PRs, also have synapses onto Tm5c neurons. There is no specificity for y
vs. p in the connections to Tm5c. Both R7 classes have input and output synapses with
Dm9, and both classes of Dm8 have output synapses onto Dm9.

DIP-γ GFP reporter in M6 layer (arrow) is shown for all panels. Gaps representing pDm8
arbors are present in wild-type control (C) but absent in ssGOF (A), where pR7 PRs have
been replaced by yR7 PRs. Ectopic expression of Dpr11 in all PRs mimics ssGOF (compare

There are large gaps (arrowheads) in yDm8 labeling in layer M6 of the neuropil indicating
extensive yDm8 cell death (compare to control (C), which has only small gaps). yDm8
arbors in M6 were examined with DIP-γGFP reporter in lGMR-Gal4>UAS-Dve. The other

Figure 8-figure supplement 2: yDm8 arbors do not innervate pR7 home columns in
dpr11 mutants.
(A)-(B): Surviving yDm8 do not mistarget to pR7 home columns in a dpr11 mutant. Midpupal optic lobes of dpr11GFP heterozygote reporter line (WT) and dpr11GFP/- (mutant) were
labeled with anti-GFP for yR7 (green), anti-DIP-γ for yDm8 (red) and Chp for all PRs (blue).
(A) and (B) show all three channels, and (A’) and (B’) show only red and blue. A yR7
column labeled by DIP-γ is defined as one in which there are red pixels directly on top of
the blue and green Chp and dpr11GFP labeling. Note that all yR7 columns with green labeling
in (A) (these appear white) are labeled by both red and blue in (A’). However, in dpr11
mutants, some yR7 columns (circled in (B) and (B’)) with green labeling have no red DIP-γ
labeling on top of the column, indicating that these are vacant yellow columns that have no
yDm8. These are quantitated in (C). All dpr11 mutant columns are either blue (pR7-Chp

only), or blue+red+green (Chp+DIP-γ+dpr11GFP), showing that no yDm8s mistarget to pR7s
(i.e., there are no red+blue columns in (B)).
(C): Some yR7 home columns are uninnervated in dpr11 mutants due to yDm8 cell death.
Pupal optic lobes of dpr11GFP reporter line (dpr11+/-) and dpr11-/- were labeled with antiGFP for yR7, anti-DIP-γ for yDm8 and Chp for all PRs. Number of yR7 columns in the
medulla were quantitated in 6x6 grids drawn on images of cross-section views. Number of
yR7 columns without yDm8 partners was determined by counting how many dpr11GFP
labeled yR7 did not have yDm8 labeling adjacent to them. Graph shows mean +/- std.
deviation and unpaired Student’s t-test p-values. In these grids, we observed no mispairing
of yDm8 with pR7, which would be demonstrated by finding anti-DIP-γ labeling adjacent to
R7 columns that were unlabeled by anti-GFP.

(D): yR7 overshoots detected with a truncated Brp marker are increased in the dpr11 null
mutant. We repeated our previously published analysis of yR7 overshoots in dpr11
mutants using the CRISPR-generated dpr11 null allele instead of dpr11GFP/Df (Carrillo et al.,
2015; Xu et al., 2018b). We used the same reporter as before, Rh4 driving a truncated
version of Brp (Brp-short; (Berger-Muller et al., 2013)) and determined the number of
overshoots in which Brp-short labeling was observed beyond (proximal to) M6. The
quantitation was done blind by a person not involved in the experiment. Graph shows
mean +/- std. deviation and unpaired Student’s t-test p-values.
