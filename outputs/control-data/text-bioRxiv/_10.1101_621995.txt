Abstract
Systemic

lupus

erythematosus

(SLE),

characterized

by

chronic

inflammation and multi-organ damage, has been suggested to associate with
gut dysbiosis, but knowledge is limited from small sample size and 16s
rRNA-based studies. To shed new light on the role of microbiota in SLE
development, we analyzed the fecal metagenome of 117 treatment-naïve SLE
patients and 115 sex- and age-matched healthy controls (HC) by
deep-sequencing; in addition, 52 of the aforementioned patients have
post-treatment fecal metagenome for comparison. We found significant
differences in microbial composition and function between SLE and HC,
revealing multiple plausible contributing bacterial species and metabolic
pathways in SLE. In-depth SNP-based analysis revealed an oral-microbiome
origin for two marker species, strengthening the importance of bacterial
translocation in disease development. Lastly, we confirmed experimentally that
peptides of SLE-enriched species mimicking autoantigens such as Sm and
Fas could trigger autoimmune responses, suggesting a potential causal role of
gut microbiota in SLE.

The pathogenesis of SLE, a prototypical autoimmune disease resulting
from loss of self-tolerance and sustained autoantibody production, has not
been fully elucidated yet. Besides host genetic factors2, environmental triggers
including microbiota are also drawing great attention3. Our study performed
deep

metagenomic sequencing to analyze

the fecal

DNA of

117

treatment-naïve SLE patients to exclude the effect of immune-suppressants;
fecal samples after treatment were also collected from 52 patients. For
comparison, we collected fecal samples from 115 sex- and age-matched
healthy controls (HC) without any other inflammatory, infectious or systemic
disease, nor received antibiotics within three months before sample collection
(Supplementary Table 1). Fecal DNA were sequenced on Illumina Hiseq
platform and a minimum of 56 million reads after quality filtering and removal
of host DNA were obtained for each sample, which were then analyzed by
MetaPhlAn24 and HUMAnN25 to derive microbial composition and function.
Among all 284 samples, 597 species and 512 MetaCyc pathways were
obtained.
We first compared alpha-diversity of fecal microbiota across groups,
including evenness indicator Shannon index based on species-level
abundance. Out of all comparisons, Shannon index was significantly lower in
samples from treatment-naïve SLE patients than those from HC (P=0.016;
Fig.1a), in line with a previous report showing that alpha diversity decreases
within many diseases6. However, Shannon index continued to decrease in the
post-treatment

fecal

samples

compared

to

pre-treatment

(P=0.044;

Supplementary Fig 1a), suggesting that treatment did not restore microbial
diversity in gut. Intriguingly, subgroup with lupus nephritis (LN) comprised the
main source of Shannon index decline (adjusted-P=0.006; Fig.1b).
Beta-diversity of gut microbiota also showed distinct pattern in SLE
patients. Analysis of Bray-Curtis distance based on species-level composition
revealed distinct profiles between SLE and HC (adonis, R2=0.030, P=0.001;
Fig 1c). The distribution of post-treatment samples demonstrated a trend to be
more similar to HC group, based on principle coordinates analysis (PCoA;
along the first axis PCoA1; Supplementary Fig 1b), but statistically not
significant (adonis, R2=0.014, P=0.086; Fig 1c), partially due to the high

within-group variability of SLE (Supplementary Fig 1b), an observation also
reported by others7. Further analysis with SLE-related clinical parameters
(Supplementary Table 2; Supplementary Fig 2a) revealed positive correlations
between serum platelet and creatinine with gut microbiota variation in SLE
(R2=0.018, P=0.045 and R2=0.019, P=0.037, respectively). Creatinine was
also significantly correlated with gut microbiota variation of all subjects
(R2=0.008, P=0.037; Supplementary Fig 2b), supporting the potential
association between renal function and gut microenvironment in SLE
development8,9.
To uncover the key microbial taxa that contributed to the difference
between SLE and HC microbiota, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) of effect
size (LEfSe) was performed using a cut-off of LDA > 2.010. The correlation
between relative abundance of significantly different species and clinical
metadata were also calculated (Supplementary Figure 3). Seven marker
species were found to be enriched in SLE patients and reduced after treatment,
including Clostridium sp. ATCC BAA-442, Atopobium rimae, Shuttleworthia
satelles, Actinomyces massiliensis, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium leptum
and an unclassified Escherichia (Fig 1e). Clostridium sp. ATCC BAA-442,
positively correlated with disease activity score (SLEDAI) (R2=0.196, P=0.034).
It could metabolize Daidzein, an isoflavone previously shown to ameliorate the
disease activity of lupus-prone mice by binding to estrogen receptor beta11,
into O-demethylangolensin12, and thus contributed to SLE. Bacteroides fragilis
is

a common commensal

bacterium composed

of

two

subgroups,

non-toxigenic (NTBF) and enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF). The
latter produces Bacteroides fragilis toxin (BFT) capable of increasing colon
mucosal permeability13, activating gut Th17 response14 and promoting
adhesion of human T cells with vascular endothelial cell line15. Indeed, bft
gene was detected in 5 samples of treatment-naïve SLE patients, and none of
the HC samples carried bft gene (coverage>0.5 with depth>1; Supplementary
Table 3). Of note, abundance of bft gene was positively correlated with the
concentration of C3 (P=0.029, R=0.211) and C4 (P=0.045, R=0.197) in SLE
serum, indicating the proinflammatory role of this bacterial group in SLE.
It is noticed that among those marker species, Actinomyces massiliensis,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/621995; this version posted April 29, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

Shuttleworthia satelles and Atopobium rimae were species originally isolated
from human oral cavity and were all closely related to oral inflammation16-18,
thus their enrichment in SLE gut indicates a possible translocation from oral
cavity. We carried out a strain-level analysis of those species based on single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using the oral metagenome from an
independent healthy cohort19 and the fecal metagenome of our HC and SLE
cohorts. Altogether we generated 5518, 3247 and 5429 SNPs for Actinomyces
massiliensis, Shuttleworthia satelles and Atopobium rimae, respectively, and
three phylogenetic trees were constructed (Fig 2). The strains of Actinomyces
massiliensis in the oral controls had a closer relationship with those in SLE
patients rather than those in HC (p < 0.0001; Fig 2a), and so did Shuttleworthia
satelles (p = 0.0020; Fig 2b). For Atopobium rimae, SLE patients
demonstrated a trend towards closer phylogeny with oral controls (p=0.0902;
Fig 2c). The enrichment of potential oral species in SLE feces suggests an
increased level of transmission of salivary microbes to gut, which has also
been found to contribute to diseases including colorectal cancer and
rheumatoid arthritis20.
We used HUMAnN2 to generate the gut microbial profile of functional
pathways, and found that SLE patients differed substantially from HC (adonis,
R2=0.047, P=0.001; Fig 1d). Functional profiles also changed significantly after
treatment (adonis, R2=0.023, P=0.029; Fig 1d), indicating a higher resolution in
distinguishing pre- and post-treatment gut microbiome than compositional data.
LEfSe was used to analyze differentially enriched pathways (LDA>2.0; Figure
1f). “superpathway of GDP-mannose-derived O-antigen building blocks
biosynthesis” was the only pathway increased in SLE patients and decreased
after

treatment.

O-antigen

comprises

the

outermost

domain

of

lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the major component of the outer membrane of
Gram-negative bacteria, and might act as a virulence factor aggravating SLE
disease condition. The relative abundances of five pathways were lower in
SLE patients and significantly reversed after treatment. Among them, three
pathways were associated with branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs),
including “superpathway of branched amino acid biosynthesis”, “L-isoleucine
biosynthesis III” and “superpathway of L-isoleucine biosynthesis I”. BCAAs

consists of valine, leucine and isoleucine, which are shown to attenuate
adaptive immunity from animal-model studies21,22. Decreased BCAA-related
pathways in gut are consistent with the reduced concentration of valine and
isoleucine in SLE serum23, which might lead to exacerbated local and systemic
inflammation.
We finally examined one key mechanism by which gut microbiota could
affect SLE development, by experimentally testing the potential of microbial
peptides in promoting autoimmune responses via molecular mimicry24. We
retrieved the autoantigen peptides that were demonstrated to trigger
autoimmune responses in SLE patients from the Immune Epitope Database
(IEDB), including those confirmed by T-cell assays or B-cell assays, and
compared them with the metagenomic sequences of species distinct between
groups. With a threshold of both identity and coverage > 80%, we identified 34
peptides similar to T-cell assay epitopes and 657 peptides similar to B-cell
assay epitopes (Supplementary Table 4 and 5), the latter including 16 peptides
identical to confirmed auto-epitopes (Supplementary Table 6) and thus with
potential immuno-pathogenicity. Using enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT)
assay, we demonstrated that the peptide “YLYDGRIFI” of IS66 family
transposase from Odoribacter splanchnicus, similar with the auto-epitope
“ILQDGRIFI” of human Sm B/B’ antigen25, was capable of increasing the
secretion of IFN-γ and IL-17A from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) of SLE patients (6 out of 21 and 5 out of 21 respectively; Figure 3a
and b). Given that anti-Sm antibody is the most specific autoantibody found in
SLE patients so far, and IFN-γ and IL-17A are implicated in the pathogenesis
of SLE26, it is highly possible that “YLYDGRIFI” from Odoribacter splanchnicus,
which decreased in SLE gut after treatment (Supplementary Fig 4a), can
trigger SLE flares. We further discovered a peptide “DGQFCM” from
Akkermansia

muciniphila,

an

enriched

species

patients

(Supplementary Fig 4b), was capable of binding to IgG produced by SLE
memory B cells (P = 0.029; Figure 3c). Mimicking the extracellular part
“DGQFCH” of human Fas27, this specific peptide might stimulate the
production of anti-Fas antibody, capable of promoting apoptosis in both lupus
patient lymphocytes and mouse keratinocytes28,29. The different responses of

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/621995; this version posted April 29, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

SLE PBMCs to the peptides above also indicate essential inter-individual
variations in susceptibility towards plausible microbial auto-antigens.
Collectively, our large-scale gut metagenomic study of the treatment-naive
SLE patients with post-treatment data suggests a disturbed microenvironment
in SLE gut, especially the enrichment of proinflammatory bacterial species and
components, part of which being a result of translocation from oral microbiota.
The multi-facet nature of SLE and inter-individual differences correspond to
plural plausible microbial contributors, and the current study could not rule out
the possibility that identified bacterial species/components only act secondarily
by exacerbating instead of causing SLE. Nonetheless, we experimentally
demonstrated that microbial peptides could trigger SLE-related cytokine
production in vitro and bind to IgG produced by SLE memory B cells, an
evidence pointing to causality between gut microbiota and SLE. Our study
offers an in-depth understanding of the relationship between SLE patients and
gut microbiota, and provides insights into further works elucidating the exact
role of various gut microbes in autoimmune diseases.

Methods
Study cohort
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Peking Union
Medical College Hospital (Ethical review number: JS-1239). Informed consent
was obtained from all subjects. 117 treatment-naïve SLE patients, who had not
received any steroids or immunosuppressants for the last 3 months, were
recruited in Peking Union Medical College Hospital. All patients fulfilled the
American College of Rheumatology revised criteria for SLE. SLE disease
activity score (SLEDAI) 2000 criteria were used to evaluate disease activity.
115 sex- and age-matched healthy control were also enrolled. Subjects were
excluded if they had (i) received antibiotic treatment within one month before
sample collection; or (ii) current evidence of any acute or chronic inflammatory
or infective diseases; or (iii) severe major systemic disease, including
malignancy; or (iv) any other autoimmune disease. All participants are Han
Chinese. The demographic characteristics and clinical metadata are listed in
Supplementary Table 1.

Sample collection and processing
Fecal samples were collected into a sterile stool container and frozen at –80°C
within 2 hours. They were then transported frozen in dry ice and extracted at
Novogene Bioinformatics Technology Co., Ltd using TIANGEN kit according to
the manufacturer’s recommendations. Agarose gel electrophoresis was used
to monitor DNA purity and integrity. DNA concentration was measured by
Qubit® 2.0 Flurometer (Life Technologies, CA, USA) using Qubit® dsDNA
Assay Kit. Samples with OD260/280 value between 1.8 to 2.0 and DNA
contents above 1ug were used for library construction.

Whole-genome shotgun sequencing
A total amount of 1μg DNA per sample was used as input material for the DNA
sample preparations. Sequencing libraries were generated using NEBNext®
Ultra™ DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB, USA) following the
manufacturer's recommendations and index codes were added to attribute
sequences to each sample. Briefly, the DNA sample was fragmented by

sonication to a size of 350bp, then DNA fragments were end-polished, A-tailed,
and ligated with the full-length adaptor for Illumina sequencing with further
PCR amplification. At last, PCR products were purified (AMPure XP system)
and libraries were analyzed for size distribution by Agilent2100 Bioanalyzer
and quantified using real-time PCR. The clustering of the index-coded samples
was performed on a cBot Cluster Generation System according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. After cluster generation, the library preparations
were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq platform and paired-end reads of 250
bp nucleotide were generated.

Metagenomic analyses
Quality control.
More than 28 million paired raw reads were obtained for each sample.
KneadData (https://bitbucket.org/biobakery/kneaddata/wiki/Home) was used
for quality control of raw reads. The human (GRCh37/hg19) reference
database was downloaded, and Bowtie2 contained in KneadData was used for
eliminating human sequences with bowtie2-options “--very-sensitive --dovetail”.
We trimmed reads with Trimmomatic in KneadData with trimmomatic-options
“SLIDINGWINDOW:4:20 MINLEN:50”. To ensure comparability, 28 million
paired-end reads were randomly extracted from the pre-processed data of
each direction, which was 56 million reads in total for each sample.
Taxonomic and functional data extraction
MetaPhlAn21

（Metagenomic Phylogenic Analysis）was used to profile the

composition of microbial communities from quality-filtered reads with
`“--mpa_pkl

${mpa_dir}/db_v20/mpa_v20_m200.pkl”

and

“--bowtie2db

${mpa_dir}/db_v20/mpa_v20_m200”. All taxonomic data were reported as
relative abundance. HUMAnN22 (the HMP Unified Metabolic Analysis Network)
was used for functional analysis (gene family and pathway). The gene families
were annotated using UniRef90 identifiers and pathways using MetaCyc IDs.
The flag “--gap-fill” was set to “on” to quantify a pathway even when a small
number of its reactions were conspicuously absent. The abundance of gene
family and pathway originally in reads per kilobase (RPK) was normalized to
relative abundance using the humann2_renorm_table function.

Taxonomical and functional profiling and statistical comparison
R software version 3.5.1 was used to perform bioinformatic analyses.
Alpha-diversity of each sample was calculated on the basis of species-level
abundance according to the Shannon index using the vegan diversity()
function Statistical significance was analyzed by non-parametric Wilcoxon
rank–sum test. PCoA plots (beta-diversity) were generated by cmdscale()
functions from a Bray–Curtis distance matrix of species-level taxa produced by
the vegan vegdist() function. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance
(PERMANOVA) was conducted using the vegan adonis() function with a
permutation number of 999. Correlation between genus or species abundance
and clinical parameters was calculated by Spearman correlation analysis
using the WGCNA corAndPvalue () function.
LEfSe3 (LDA Effect Size), an algorithm for high-dimensional biomarker
discovery and explanation, was used for identification of genomic features
(taxa, genes, and pathways) characterizing the differences between SLE
patients and HC. Both alpha value for the factorial Kruskal-Wallis test and for
the Wilcoxon test between classes were set to 0.05. The threshold on the
logarithmic LDA score for discriminative features was 2.0. The visualization of
significant different species were generated with GraPhlAn4.
SNP-based strain-level analysis
For the analysis of the oral origin of the enriched gut species in SLE patients,
16 oral samples of an independent healthy cohort5, 115 fecal samples of our
HC cohort and 117 fecal samples of our SLE cohort were included.
StrainPhlAn was used for identifying the specific strains of species across all
samples, based on the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the
conserved and unique species marker genes. The tool is designed to track
strains across large collections of samples. The raw metagenomic reads in
FASTQ format were taken as input and were mapped against the set of
species-specific markers (>200 per species). A variant calling approach was
used by StrainPhlAn to reconstruct the sample-specific marker loci and to
output the sequences of each sample-specific marker in a FASTA format.
Sequences are extracted from the raw reads using a reference-free majority

rule that filters out the noise regions. The resulting sequences were then
concatenated and aligned by samtools. The reconstructed markers were then
used to build a phylogenic tree based on the large SNP datasets by samtools
and StrainPhlAn. The phylogenetic tree was built by SNPhylo with a maximum
likelihood method. The number of the fecal samples that are clustered with the
oral samples in each cohort is counted.

Molecular mimicry analysis
Epitopes extraction
Autoantigen epitopes that were reported to trigger autoimmune reactions in
SLE patients were identified from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB,
http://www.iedb.org/), including 60 epitopes proved by T-cell assays and 705
epitopes proved by B-cell assays. The amino acid sequences of these
epitopes were mapped to the protein sequences of significant different species
identified with LEfSe using BLAST6.
Enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay
Heparinized blood samples were obtained from SLE participants in Peking
Union Medical College Hospital. Patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque density-gradient centrifugation.
IFN-γ and IL-17A ELISPOT assays were performed using Human ELISpotplus
kit (MabTech) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 96-well
MultiScreen Filter Plates (Millipore) pre-coated with capture antibody were
washed 5× with PBS and blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for at
least 30 min at room temperature before use. Duplicates of 2-5 × 105 PBMCs
per well were plated with 50 μg/ml peptides and incubated overnight (20-24 h).
Plates were washed 5× with PBS and then 1 μg/ml anti-human IFN-γ mAb
(7-B6-1-Biotin) or 0.5 μg/ml anti-human IL-17A mAb (MT504-Biotin) was
added and incubated for 2 h. Next, each plate was washed 5× with PBS and
incubated for 1 h with streptavidin–ALP, followed by 5× washes with PBS and
development with 0.45-μm-filtered TMB substrate for 10-20min. The reaction
was stopped by rinsing extensively with deionized water, and the plates were
left to dry. Antigen-specific IgG ELISpot assays were performed using Human
IgG ELISpotBASIC kit (MabTech). PBMCs were first pre-stimulated with a

mixture of R848 at 1 μg/ml and rhIL-2 at 10 ng/ml for 96h, promoting the ability
of memory B cell to secret detectable IgG. The ELISpot plates were coated
with anti-human IgG (mAbs MT91/145) overnight at 4°C. After washing and
blocking with 10% FBS, duplicates of 2-5 × 105 PBMCs were plated in the
coated ELISpot plates for 36h. Plates were washed with PBS, then 1 μg/ml
biotinylated peptides were added and incubated for 2 h. The subsequent
operations were consistent with above. Plates were finally scanned and
enumerated using an ImmunoSpot plate reader (Cellular Technology Limited).
Each well was scored positive if the number of spot-forming cells detected
were at least twice over the negative control (the randomly synthesized
peptides).

Statistical analysis
Determination of whether the SLE or HC fecal samples had a higher homology
with the oral samples considering a specific species used the Fisher’s exact
test. Friedman tests were utilized to calculate the significance level for ELISpot
assays between different groups. The tests above were achieved using
GraphPad Prism 7.0. The number of samples in each experiment is provided
in the figure legends. All statistical tests in our study were performed
two-sided.

patients were first pre-stimulated with a mixture of R848 at 1 μg/ml and rhIL-2
at 10 ng/ml for 96h. They were then plated in the ELISpot plates for 36h
producing IgG. 6 SLE PBMCs were tested and 4 of them showed positivity for
the microbial peptide “DGQFCM” from Akkermansia muciniphila. Detecting the
IgG specific for randomly synthesized “DTYESE” was set as a negative control.
c, An example of IgG ELISpot results. Each spot in well represents a cell that
had secreted a kind of peptide-specific IgG during incubation. d. The plot
showing the number of spots inspected in different groups. Points connected
by each line represent the data from a single patient. Black points and solid
lines represent the samples that were reactive to autoimmune and microbial
peptides, while gray points and dash lines represent those were not reactive.
The significance levels were calculated by Friedman test and paired t test for
cytokine and IgG ELISpot respectively, only including the samples that were
positive for the auto-epitopes. All numbers of spots were counted by
subtracting the spot number of the solvent controls.
