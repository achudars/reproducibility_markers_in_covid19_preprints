Abstract
The ribosome is an RNA-protein complex essential for translation in all domains of life. The structural
and catalytic core of the ribosome is its ribosomal RNA (rRNA). While mutations in ribosomal protein
30

(RP) gene are known drivers of oncogenesis, oncogenic rRNA variants have remained elusive.
We discovered a cancer-specific single nucleotide variation at 18S.1248U in the 18S rRNA of up to
45.9% colorectal carcinoma (CRC) patients and across >22 cancer types. This is the site of a unique
hyper-modified base, 1-methyl-3-α-amino-α-carboxyl-propyl pseudouridine (m1acp3Ψ), a modification), a modification
that is >1 billion years conserved at the ribosome’s peptidyl decoding-site. A sub-set of CRC tumors we

35

term ‘hypo-m1acp3Ψ), a modification’, show sub-stoichiometric m1acp3Ψ), a modification-modification unlike normal control tissues.
Our m1acp3Ψ), a modification knockout model and hypo-m1acp3Ψ), a modification patient tumors share a translational signature,
characterized by highly abundant ribosomal proteins.
Thus, m1acp3Ψ), a modification-deficient rRNA forms an uncharacterized class of ‘onco-ribosome’ which may serve as
an innovative chemotherapeutic target for treating cancer patients.

Introduction
The ribosome is a massive ribonucleoprotein particle (RNP) responsible for the transformation of
genetic information encoded as nucleic acids into functional proteins encoded as amino acids. Unlike
most RNPs, it is ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and not ribosomal proteins (RPs) that form the most ancient
and catalytic core of the complex 1. rRNA is further functionalized by a constellation of at least 14

45

distinct chemical modifications across 200+ sites, 2 clustering around active sites of the ribosome 3, yet
the function of many rRNA modifications remain unclear.
The human ribosome contains >80 RPs and four rRNAs, totaling ~80% of cellular RNA. During the
initial human genome sequencing project, ribosomal DNA (rDNA) loci were systematically excluded
from the reference genome4; given that a reference sequence of the rRNA gene, RNA45S, was available

50

and the 80-800 rDNA copies were believed to be homogeneous 5, although there was early evidence for
rDNA polymorphism in humans6,7. Thus, as technology and sequencing consortium projects
revolutionized genomics and transcriptomics, our understanding of rDNA variation has lagged.
rDNA sequence variation at the intra- and inter-individual level has been documented in multiple
species including humans8–12, but the functional implications of rDNA variation remain elusive.

55

Mutation of RP genes and ribosome biogenesis factors can cause a class of diseases termed
ribosomopathies, including Diamond Blackfan anemia (DBA)13, and some cancers14. It has been
hypothesized that cancer cells contain a functionally specialized class of ribosomes to facilitate rapid
protein synthesis, termed the “onco-ribosomes”15,16. Cancer genomics has supported this notion with the
identification of several oncogenic driver mutations in RP genes 14, the best characterized of which are

60

RPL10 (uL16) p.R98S in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia17,18 and RPS15 (uS19) C’ terminal
mutations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia19. In addition, germline mutations such as in DBA patients
and in RPS20 can cause heredity cancers including colorectal carcinoma (CRC)20,21.
As RP mutations have been implicated in tumorigenesis, we hypothesized that rRNA variation or
mutation is a cancer driver. To map functional rRNA sequence variation, we considered tumorigenesis

65

as a natural experiment in which polymorphic and mutant rRNA alleles undergo selective evolutionary
change in frequency within each patient. We discovered a surprising 18S rRNA single nucleotide
variation at the decoding core of the ribosomal peptidyl (P)-site, affecting up to 45.9% of CRC patients,
making this the most frequent ribosomal variant associated with cancer to date and potentially
revolutionizing future chemotherapeutic strategies against this disease.

Results & Discussion
An unexpected rRNA variant in cancer: sub-stoichiometric modification of 18S.1248.m1acp3Ψ
In an initial screen for cancer-driver rRNA variants, we aligned RNA-seq reads from 66 colorectal
carcinoma (CRC) tumors and patient-matched adjacent normal tissue to a single-copy reference rDNA.
To test for allelic selection inconsistent with neutral drift, the patient-matched difference in expressed

75

variant allele frequency (VAF) was measured for deviation from zero for each position of 18S and 28S
(Fig. 1a). A single nucleotide variation deviated from neutrality, 18S:r.1248.U (padj = 3.81e-8). The
18S.1248.U variation is recurrent selection over non-U or 18S.1248V alleles in a striking 44.9% of
CRC patients (Fig. 1a); in comparison, oncogenic KRASG12 codon mutation occurs in only 36% of CRC
patients22.

80

Surprisingly, at the DNA level, RNA45S:1248.T is invariable in humans10 and in the mature rRNA this
uridine undergoes hyper-modification to 1-methyl-3-α-amino-α-carboxyl-propyl pseudouridine
(m1acp3Ψ), a modification) (Fig. 1b)2. The m1acp3Ψ), a modification modification perturbs standard Watson-Crick base-pairing during
cDNA synthesis by reverse transcriptase (RT) 23, resulting in base misincorporation and enzyme stalling,
which is read-out as a consistent ‘modification signature’ in RNA-seq (Fig. 1c, reviewed in

85

23

). The

increase in reference U sequence suggests that the m 1acp3Ψ), a modification modification is incomplete or substoichiometric in CRC tumors, which we term the ‘hypo-m 1acp3Ψ), a modification phenotype’. The 28S.1321.m1A and
28S.4532.m3U rRNA modifications also cause a ‘modification signature’ in RNA-seq23. These
modifications do not decrease in CRC tumors or matched normal controls, excluding a non-specific
rRNA modification effect (Fig. 1d).

90

The hypo-m1acp3Ψ), a modification phenotype is reproducible at comparable frequency (27.8-45.9%) in three additional
independent patient-matched CRC cohorts (Fig. 1e,f). Analysis of 10,036 cancer patients and 712
normal controls across an additional 31 cancer-patient cohorts reveals that hypo-m1acp3Ψ), a modification occurs at a
significant frequency across a diverse set of cancers, but is not pan-cancerous (global recurrence: 9.6%
range: 0-52.8%) (Fig. 1f, S1).

95

To validate these findings, we designed a simple and rapid RT-PCR m1acp3Ψ), a modification assay for measuring
18S.1248.m1acp3Ψ), a modification modification. The m1acp3Ψ), a modification assay is reproducible and quantitative (Fig. S2). An
important technical limitation is that different RT enzymes have different base misincorporation rates at
18S.1248.m1acp3Ψ), a modification, thus, cross-cohort or cross-experimental comparisons should be made cautiously,
including in RNA-seq (Fig. S2b-d). Indeed, batch-effects on VAF are seen within TCGA cohorts, but

hypo-m1acp3Ψ), a modification replicates across batches, further supporting that hypo-m1acp3Ψ), a modification is occurring in tumors
specifically (Fig. S1b).
We validated that the hypo-m1acp3Ψ), a modification phenomenon also occurs in CRC cell lines assayed as a single
batch and confirmed the results are not a sequencing artifact (Fig. S2e). To test if m1acp3Ψ), a modification-deficient
rRNA incorporate into mature ribosomes, we isolated monosomes and polysomes and detected low

105

m1acp3Ψ), a modification modification levels in mono- and di-somes (Fig. S2f). As the molecular, biological, and
medical significance of 18S.1248.m1acp3Ψ), a modification unfolds, it is obvious that genotyping technologies (such as
sequencing or our m1acp3Ψ), a modification assay) and previous m1acp3Ψ), a modification assays such as primer extension can be
adapted as affordable and rapid diagnostic or prognostic assays.
18S:1248.m1acp3Ψ is an ancient modification at the P-site core

110

We next investigated the evolutionary and structural characteristics of 18S.1248.m1acp3Ψ), a modification for functional
insight. The 18S:1248.U base and m1acp3Ψ), a modification modification are absolutely conserved across Eukarya at a
residue located in the loop of universal helix 31 (Fig. S3). TSR3 is the aminocarboxylpropyl transferase
which deposits the acp3 at 18S.1248.U24 and it only modifies this single rRNA position, in 100% of
mature rRNA molecules25,26.

115

Structurally, 18S.1248.m1acp3Ψ), a modification is solvent-exposed at the ribosomal P-site, immediately adjacent to the
codon:anti-codon interface (Fig. 2). Cryo-EM structures27,28 and our molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations implicate the m1acp3-modification in a direct interaction with P-site tRNA with the
carboxyl-moiety forming a hydrogen bond with the universally conserved RPS16 p.R14629 and
reducing 18S rRNA flexibility at the decoding site (Fig. S4).

120

Start AUG-codon selection and translational initiation is a rate-limiting step in protein-synthesis and
both occur at the P-site. Thus, the hypo-m1acp3Ψ), a modification phenotype may demarcate a class of ‘onco-ribosome’
with deregulated translation. It is noteworthy that the two largest effect size RP cancer driver mutations
also occur at the ribosomal P-site/tRNA interface, the RPL10 p.R98S at the peptidyl transfer site 17,18
and RPS15 C` tail mutations adjacent (<12Å) to 1248.m 1acp3Ψ), a modification (Fig. 2a) suggesting that the ribosomal

125

P-site is a convergent multi-cancer oncogenic hot-spot.
Since the discovery of streptomycin in 1944, the ribosome has been the target of several important
classes of drugs30. The pervasive and recurrent loss of a solvent-exposed and charged acp 3 modification
at the decoding core of the small sub-unit raises the possibility that this pocket may be therapeutically

exploited with ribosome targeting antibiotics or their derivatives as a new generation of
130

chemotherapies.
Loss of 18S.1248.m1acp3Ψ modification induces ribosomal protein mRNA translation
To delineate the function of 18S.1248.m1acp3Ψ), a modification, we generated TSR3 knockout CRC cell lines
(HCT116). Similar to yeast24, TSR3 is non-essential and we isolated two TSR3 homozygous knockouts
(TSR3[KO 1,3]), a heterozygous knockout (TSR3[Het 2]), as well as three wildtype control clones

135

(WT[1-3]). Knockouts were functionally confirmed by three independent m 1acp3Ψ), a modification assays, with
TSR3[Het 2] showing an intermediate or hypo-m 1acp3Ψ), a modification phenotype (Fig. 3a, S2g). Loss of the acp 3
modification via TSR3[KO] is sufficient to abolish nucleotide misincorporation during RT as measured
by RNA-seq, supporting hypo-m1acp3Ψ), a modification tumors contain sub-stoichiometric loss of the acp3-moiety.
Morphologically, the HCT116 clones were indistinguishable and showed comparable, rapid growth in

140

vitro (Fig. 3b). To determine how loss of 18S.1248.m1acp3Ψ), a modification modification affects the transcriptome and
translatome of these cells we performed RNA-seq and ribo-seq, respectively (Fig. S5).
Transcriptionally, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that TSR3[KO]/[Het] (vs. WT) cells
were dominated by a proliferative tumor expression signature, characterized by elevated E2F
transcription factor activity (Fig. 3c, Fig. S6, table S3). Yet, TSR3[KO]/[Het] cells also have a

145

paradoxical decrease in translational efficiency of the same E2F target genes (Fig. S6).
To determine how loss of 18S.1248.m1acp3Ψ), a modification modification alters translation, we contrasted translational
efficiency between genotypes. TSR3[KO]/[Het] cells showed a remarkable enrichment (vs. WT) in the
translation of RPs and associated with a depletion of RP mRNA (Fig. 3d).
To validate if this RP mRNA/protein signature is present in patients, we analyzed the CPTAC-CRC

150

cohort with tumor matched RNA-seq and proteomics data 31. Similar to TSR3[KO]/[Het] cell lines,
hypo-m1acp3Ψ), a modification CRC tumors share the same E2F oncogenic gene signature and a proteomic increase in
RPs relative to normo-m1acp3Ψ), a modification CRC tumor controls (Fig. 3e,f).
There are two hypotheses with which to interpret the hypo-m1acp3Ψ), a modification phenotype. The ‘oncogenic driver
hypothesis’ is that m1acp3Ψ), a modification-deficient rRNA arise in tumorigenesis, and their dysregulated translation

155

confers a selective advantage to the cancer, likely via high RP output. The recapitulation of the
TSR3[KO]/[Het] multi-omic phenotype in hypo-m1acp3Ψ), a modification CRC patients supports a causal model.
Alternatively, m1acp3Ψ), a modification-deficiency arises in consequence to hyper-proliferation and high ribosomal

biogenesis. Rapid cellular turn-over in turn results in ‘incomplete modification’ of rRNA. Under this
model the consequences of m1acp3Ψ), a modification-deficient rRNA is near-neutral or tolerably detrimental to tumor

fitness. Nevertheless, hypo-m1acp3Ψ), a modification is a highly recurrent pertubation to the ancient peptidyl-decoding
core and underlies a greater cancer-translational phenomenon.
Conclusions
Ribosomes are the fulcrum in the central dogma of molecular biology. Multi-omics studies have
repeatedly highlighted the discordance between mRNA and protein abundance32,33, emphasizing the

165

role of translational variability in physio-normal and pathological states. Several recent studies have
begun to resolve the ribosome from a uniform assembly into a rich tapestry of functionally
heterogeneous complexes making up distinct translational compartments in the cell 15,16,34–37. We have
discovered a pervasive and cancer-specific ‘onco-ribosome’ marked by loss of rRNA m 1acp3Ψ), a modification

and can be explored as a novel chemotherapeutic class.

Materials & Methods
Ribosomal sequence alignment and variant allele frequency calculations
DNA and RNA-seq libraries used in this study were prepared via poly-A selection to enrich for the
345

~5% of mRNA from total RNA. Since rRNA is ~80% of cellular RNA it invariably ‘contaminates’
RNA-seq libraries. Typically, poly-(A) RNA-seq libraries contain 3.55% (+/- 0.685, 95% CI, CRC I
cohort, N = 66) of total reads aligned to rDNA. A complete list of library accessions used in this study
is available in table S142–45.
Libraries were aligned to the hgr1 reference rDNA sequence10 with bowtie2 (v. 2.3.5.1, command:

350

`bowtie2 --very-sensitive-local -x hgr1 -1 <read1.fq.gz> -2 <read2.fq.gz>`)46. For each cohort of
libraries, a genomic variant call format (GVCF) was created with bcftools (v. 1.9, command: `bcftools
mpileup -f hgr1.fa –max-depth 10000 -A -min-BQ 30 -b <bam.file.list>`)47.
GVCF files were processed in R by custom scripts to calculate variant allele frequency (VAF). VAF is
defined as 1 – reference allele frequency (reference allele depth of coverage / total depth of coverage)

355

(scripts available at https://www.github.com/ababaian/crown)
The threshold to define hypo-modification of an RNA base (including 18S.1248.m1acp3Ψ), a modification) was defined
as three standard deviations below average VAF of the normal samples within the same cohort (false
discovery rate = 0.00135) when available. Fixed formalin paraffin embedded (FFPE) libraries in TCGA
were negative for 18S.1248.m1acp3Ψ), a modification, 28S.1321.m1A and 28S.4532.m3U modification signatures and

360

excluded from further analysis. In the CPTAC-CRC cohort (normal RNA-seq is unavailable), hypom1acp3Ψ), a modification and normo-m1acp3Ψ), a modification was defined by the lower (<25%) and upper (>75%) quantiles of samples
within a batch.
Transcriptome and translatome alignment, assembly and differential expression
RNA-seq reads were aligned to hg38 (GRCh38) reference genome with tophat2 (v.2.0.14)48. Individual

365

transcriptome assemblies for HCT116 [WT 1-3], [KO 1,2] and [Het 2] libraries were generated with
stringtie (v 2.0)49, and then all merged together with the human gencode basic gene annotation (v. 31)50
ultimately yielding the hct116_gencode.v31 reference gene set.
To generate a single-copy reference transcriptome for ribo-seq analysis of HCT116, isoform-specific
quantification of gene expression was performed on the hct116_gencode.v31 gene set with `stringtie -G

370

hct116_gencode.gtf`. For each gene with non-zero expression (>10 unique reads), the one highest

expression isoform (average expression from each clone) was chosen as the reference transcript for that
gene.
For ribo-seq alignment, after read adapter trimming and alignment to hgr1 as above, unmapped reads
were aligned against a containment file containing human tRNA, mtDNA, snoRNA, snRNA and

miRNA sequences.

HCT116 cell culture and TSR3 knockout
The colorectal carcinoma cell line HCT116 (CCL-247, ATCC, Manassas, VA) was cultured in DMEM
media (#36250, STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (F1051, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA).

395

To generate TSR3 knockouts, 105 HCT116 cells were transfected with 10 nmol of one of three TSR3
targeting Alt-R CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoproteins or non-targeting controls (table S2) by manufacturer's
protocol (1081059, Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT), Coralville, IA). After 24 hours, single cells
from each treatment group were isolated by limiting dilution and confirmed to be 1 cell /well by
microscopy. Single cell clones were expanded to 5x105 cells at which point half the culture was frozen

RNA-seq and functional knockout was confirmed by three independent m1acp3Ψ), a modification assays (figure 3, S2).
Cell lines and clonal isolates were tested to be free of mycoplasma contamination by DAPI staining and
microscopy and with LookOut Mycoplamsa Detection Kit (MP0035, MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA)
by manufacturer’s protocol.

405

RNA isolation and RNA-seq
Cells for RNA extraction were lysed directly in TRIzol reagent (15596-018, Invitrogen), spun 5 min at
12,000 x g to pellet fat and nuclear DNA and then frozen at -80°C. RNA extraction was carried out by
manufacturer’s protocol. RNA quality was assessed via 2% denaturing RNA agarose gel
electrophoresis (heat treated, 95°C for 5 minutes in 1.5x formamide loading buffer 56) and

410

concentration/purity assessed by spectrophotometer (NanoDrop 2000, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA).
RNA quality for RNA-seq library preparation had a >9.9 RIN score measured by Bioanalyzer 2100
(Agilent, Santa Clara, CA).
RNA-seq library preparation and sequencing was performed by the BC Cancer Genome Sciences
Centre, Vancouver, Canada. Briefly, 75-bp stranded and paired-end poly-(A) RNA-seq libraries were

415

prepared with NEBNext poly(A) mRNA magnetic isolation module (E7490L, New England BioLabs
(NEB), Ipswich, MA), Maxima H minus First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (K1652, Thermo-Fisher), and
NEBNext Ultra II directional RNA second strand synthesis (E7771, NEB). The total RNA-seq libraries
were prepared in parallel but without poly-(A) selection and only 2x PCR cycles (for adapter ligation).
Libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq 2500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA).

Assays for 18S.1248.m1acp3Ψ modification
Primer extension was performed with 1 µg of total RNA, incubated with 2 pmol of PE_1248_BLOCK
(IDT) primer and 2U of RNase H (18021-014, Invitrogen) or mock enzyme treatment at 37°C for 20
min followed by heat inactivation at 65°C for 10 min. SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (18080044,
lot #2042663, Invitrogen) and the flourophore labeled PE_1248_FAM primer were added for primer

425

annealing and RT (1h at 50°C) as described by Schuster and Bertram 57. Labeled cDNAs were resuspended in 1.5x formamide loading buffer and heated to 95°C for 3 min to eliminate secondary

Biosystems, Wayne PA) and WarmStart RTx (M0380L, lot #0061705, NEB) by each manufacturer’s
protocol with minor modifications. RT reactions were carried out with a random hexamer primer only,
and not poly(T) oligos. cDNAs were diluted five-fold and used as template for PCR (30 cycles: 94°C
for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, 72°C for 30 s) with macp_F1 and macp_R1 primers (table S2). Amplicons were
digested with HinFI (R0155S, New England BioLabs) (25°C for 5 sec, 37°C for 90 min, 80°C for 20

440

min). Samples were separated on a 2.25% agarose gel in 1x TBE at 200 V for 45 min at 4°C. After
migration, the gel was post-stained in 1x GelRed (41003, Biotium, Fremont CA) for 30 min. Gels were
visualized by UV transillumination, captured in gray scale with a digital camera and pseudo-colored in
ImageJ58 (v 1.52h, Lookup table > Fire) which retains the original pixel intensity values but highlights
band-intensity visualization.

Ribosome foot-printing
Ribosome foot printing (ribo-seq) was performed as previously described59 with minor modifications.
For cell harvesting, the culture medium was aspirated, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS
supplied with 100 μg total RNA) prior to RT tog/ml cycloheximide and plates were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. For cell lysis,
the plates were placed on wet ice and 400 µl of mammalian polysome buffer (MPB) [20 mM Tris-HCl,

450

pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, with 1 mM DTT and 100 μg total RNA) prior to RT tog/ml cycloheximide, 1% (vol/vol)
Triton X-100, 25 U/ml Turbo DNase ( AM2238, Invitrogen) was dripped onto the plates. Cells were
scraped, the lysate was collected to fresh 1.5 ml tube, passed ten times through a 26-gauge needle,
cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 x g for 10 min, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C
until further use. For isolation of ribosome-protected RNA fragments, 240 μg total RNA) prior to RT tol of the lysate was digested

455

with 6 μg total RNA) prior to RT tol of RNase I (AM2294, 100 U/μg total RNA) prior to RT tol, Invitrogen) at room temperature with rotation. After 45 min 8
μg total RNA) prior to RT tol of SUPERase-In (20 U/μg total RNA) prior to RT tol, AM2694, Invitrogen) was added to reaction and passed through
MicroSpin S-400 HR columns (27-5140-01, GE Healthcare) equilibrated with mammalian polysome
buffer. RNA was extracted from the flow-through using Trizol LS (10296-010, Invitrogen) followed by

depletion of ribosomal RNA fragments with the RiboZero Kit (MRZH11124, Illumina). Ribosome460

protected RNA fragments were loaded onto denaturing 17% urea-PAGE gel (EC-829, National
Diagnostics) and gel area ranging from 27 nt to 30 nt, defined by corresponding RNA markers, was cut
out. Purified RNA fragments were subjected to library generation using 3′ adapter 4N-RA3, 5′ adapter
OR5-4N, RT primer RTP and PCR primers RP1 (forward primer) and RPI1-15 (reverse primers,
containing barcodes). Libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 device (Illumina).

Polysome Fractionation
Polysome fractionation was performed as previously described60, with minor modifications. Media was
removed from 100 mm dish with ~10 7 cells and washed with ice-cold ddH 2O containing 100 μg total RNA) prior to RT toM CHX.
All subsequent steps were performed chilled at 4°C or on ice. After ddH2O aspiration, cells were
incubated for 30 min in 450 μg total RNA) prior to RT toL of hypotonic lysis buffer [0.1x polysome base buffer (PBB), 150 mM

470

KCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 15 mM MgCl2 in ddH2O; with 1% Triton-X 100 and 1x protease
inhibitor (4693132001, MilliporeSigma). After confirming >95% free nuclei with a hemocytometer,
nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,800 x g for 5 minutes. Cytoplasmic fraction was separated
from mitochondria by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 5 minutes. 300 μg total RNA) prior to RT toL cytoplasmic lysate was
layered atop at 7-45% sucrose gradient (Gradient Master, BioComp, Fredericton, Canada) in 1x PBB.

475

Gradients were ultra-centrifuged at 221,600 x g for 2 hours at 4°C (SW-41Ti rotor, 331362, Beckman
Coulter, Brea, CA). Gradients were fractionated (Piston Fractionator, BioComp) into 20 x 300 μg total RNA) prior to RT toL
fractions with in-line UV-scanning at 254 nm. Fractions were immediately frozen at -20°C for
subsequent RNA extraction.
Ribosomal molecular dynamics simulations

480

All molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed as described in Girodat et al. 2019 61. In
brief, 80S ribosome models were derived from available human Cryo-EM structures with a resolved
18S.1248.m1acp3Ψ), a modification (PDB: 6EKO for E-site tRNA and 6OLE for A/P and P/E tRNA) 27,28.
For simulations lacking m1acp3Ψ), a modification modifications, the base was converted to uracil. Each system was
protonated with the psfgen package in VMD 1.9.3, and only e-nitrogen for histidine were protonated 62.

485

Each system was solvated with a 10Å TIP3P water box with a concentration of 7mM MgCl 2 and
100mM KCl using the solvate and autoionize packages, respectively62. All minimizations and MD
simulations were performed with NAMD 2.1.2 using CHARMM 36 standard parameters63–65 and
modified nucleic acid parameters from Xu et al. 201666.

Each system underwent a steepest descent minimization of water for 10,000 steps then water and ions
490

for 100,000 steps twice followed by minimization of nucleic acid and protein for 50,000 steps and
finally the whole system for 100,000 steps. After minimization all systems were equilibrated to 300 and
350 K for 150 ps. Coordinates of the 350 K equilibration in conjunction with velocities from the 300 K
equilibration were used as initial parameters for the MD simulation. Each system was simulated for
~20ns. Energy contributions of 18S.1248.m1acp3Ψ), a modification or 18S.1248.U were determined with the NAMD

495

Energy package65.
Statistics
Statistical analysis was performed in R (v 3.5.1). Differences in variant allele frequency (VAF) between
tumor and normal patient samples was two-tailed, paired Student’s T-test with degrees of freedom one
less than reported n. Bonferonni multiple-testing correction was applied when screening for changes

500

across 18S and 28S nucleotides. Error bars on boxplots are quantiles. Differential gene expression and
translation was tested with DEseq253 with Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction at an alpha
of 0.05. Multi-group comparisons between HCT116 WT[1],[2],[3] and TSR3[KO 1],[KO 3],[Het2]
ribo-seq were performed with one-way ANNOVA, followed by Tukey’s Honestly Significant
Differencce (HSD) test if indicated.
