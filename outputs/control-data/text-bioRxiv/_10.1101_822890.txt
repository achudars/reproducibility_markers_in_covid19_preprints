Abstract
Background The most common type of metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is an inherited
lysosomal disorder caused by recessive mutations in ARSA. The biological process of MLD
disease caused by candidate pathogenic mutations in the ARSA gene remains unclear.
Methods We used whole-exome sequencing (WES) and Sanger sequencing to identify the
pathogenic mutation in a Chinese family. Literature review and protein three-dimensional
structure prediction were performed to analyse the potential pathogenesis of the identified
mutations. Overexpression cell models of wild-type and mutated ARSA genes were
constructed to obtain expression profiles, and weighted gene co-expression network analysis
(WGCNA), hub gene detection and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis were carried out
to compare the biological changes caused by candidate pathogenic mutations.
Results We identified an ARSA c.925G>A homozygous mutation from a Chinese
late-infantile MLD patient, the first report of this mutation in Asia. According to the literature
and protein structure analysis, three mutations of c.925G (c.925G>A, c.925G>T, c.925G>C)
in the ARSA gene were pathogenic. The transcriptome of four ARSA overexpression cell
models (c.925G, c.925G>A, c.925G>T, c.925G>C) were analysed by WGCNA, Hub genes
and PPI complexes.RNA-seq and bioinformatics results indicate that the mutations at c.925G
cause comprehensive molecular changes related to energy metabolism, ion binding, vesicle
transport and transport.
Conclusion We identified a pathogenic mutation, ARSA homozygosity c.925G>A, from a
Chinese MLD family. All three mutations of c.925G in the ARSA gene are pathogenic and
may cause disease by dysregulating the molecular processes of ion binding, vesicle transport
and ion transport.

Introduction
Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is an inherited lysosomal disorder caused by recessive
gene mutations in ARSA and PSAP.1-4 It is recognized that there are 5 allelic forms of MLD
(MIM ID: 250100), including late-infantile, juvenile, adult, partial cerebroside sulfate
deficiency, and pseudoarylsulfatase A deficiency;3-4 and 2 nonallelic forms, including
metachromatic leukodystrophy due to saposin B deficiency (MIM ID: 249900) and multiple
sulfatase deficiency or juvenile sulfatidosis (MIM ID: 272200), a disorder that combines
features of a mucopolysaccharidosis with those of metachromatic leukodystrophy. MLD is a
rare disorder with an estimated birth prevalence of 1.4 to 1.8 per 100,000; there are also
reports of 1/40,000 to 1/170,000.5-6 Although a series of potential therapies, such as
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation,7 enzyme replacement therapy8 and gene therapy9
have been explored, currently there is no curative treatment for this disease.
The most common type of MLD disease is an autosomal recessive inherited lysosomal
disorder caused by mutations in the ARSA gene, located on chromosome 22q13.33, resulting
in a deficiency of the enzyme arylsulfatase A. The low activity of arylsulfatase A results in
the accumulation of sulfatides in the central and peripheral nervous systems, leading to
demyelination.1 To date more than 200 ARSA allele types have been reported as
ARSA-causative variants.10
Whole-exome sequencing (WES) is a genomic analysis technique that captures and sequences
all exons in the whole genome. It is widely used for the auxiliary diagnosis of monogenic
diseases and hereditary complex diseases.11 Studies have recommended WES as the preferred
diagnostic procedure to detect potential pathogenic genetic variants in affected individuals
with genetic characteristics but without clear MLD clinical diagnosis, combined with
biochemical, enzymatic or imaging studies to complete the final diagnosis.12
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is an effective method to obtain the transcriptome of life
embodied in status.13 Besides of expression status of single genes, more complex
physiological processes can be reflected via system biology approaches, such as weighted
gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). By using WGCNA gene expression data can
be transformed into co-expression modules, which provide insights into signalling networks
that may be responsible for phenotypic traits of interest.14 Moreover, hub genes analysed from
co-expression modules are quite helpful for the identification of candidate biomarkers or
therapeutic targets.15-16 Combined with protein-protein interaction (PPI) information,
co-expression modules also provide valuable clues to reveal the dynamic protein complexes.
Protein complexes are of great importance for understanding the principles of cellular
organization and function.17

In current study, we reported a Chinese family with a 2-year-old boy who could not sit or
walk independently. By using WES technology we identified a missense mutation in exon 5
of the ARSA gene (c.925G>A homozygous mutation) in the proband and supported the
clinical diagnosis of MLD. The mutation site was first reported in Asia, a systematics
literature review and bioinformatics analyses were carried out to estimate its pathogenicity. A
series of ARSA-mutant cell models were consequently constructed to simulate the cell state
of homozygous-mutant patients and RNA-seq and system biology analysis were performed to
explore the potential molecular pathogenesis of the identified mutation.

Methods
Patients
The current study was approved by the Ethics Committee (NO. 201801001-1) of the
Children's Hospital Affiliated with Nanjing Medical University (Nanjing, China). Prior to the
study, written informed consent for genetic tests and publication of the case details was
obtained from all adult participants and the parents or the legal guardians of children involved
in the study.
Mutation analysis
Peripheral blood samples were obtained from patients and members of their families with
informed consent. DNA was prepared according to standard protocols (Cat. No. CW2087,
CoWin Bioscience, China).
WES was performed on the genomic DNA of the proband and members of his family (exome
sequencing and bioinformatics analysis of sequencing raw data completed in Oumeng V
Medical Laboratory Co., Ltd.). One microgram of genomic DNA from peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was used to establish the exome library. Genomic DNA was
randomly sheared by sonication and then hybridized to the Agilent SureSelect Human All
Exon V6 Library to enrich exonic DNA in each library, following the manufacturer’s
instructions. An enriched library targeting the exome was sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq
2000 platform to generate paired-end 150 bp sequences (PE150). The mean coverage of each
exon was more than 100×, allowing for the examination of the selected region and sufficient
depth to accurately match 99% of the targeted exome. Variant calling was performed with
reference to UCSC hg19reference genome (http://genome.ucsc.edu/).18 Single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) and small insertions or deletions (indels) were sifted using
ANNOVAR (2015Dec14) with the defined parameters after the deletion of duplicated reads.19
Short insertions or deletions (indels) altering coding sequences or splicing sites were also
identified by GATK (3.3.0). The common variants and non-pathogenic candidate variants
were

Phenotyping version 2 (PolyPhen-2, http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/),20 Sorting
Intolerant from Tolerant (SIFT, http://sift.jcvi.org/; score less than 0.05 indicates it is
deleterious)21 and MutationTaster (http://www.mutationtaster.org/)22 were used to evaluate
whether amino acid substitutions affected protein function.
Variants were identified as nonpathogenic and removed if they fit any of the following criteria:
(1) variants with an allele frequency greater than 5%; (2) variants located in introns and not
affecting splicing; (3) synonymous variants without affecting splicing; or (4) variants located
in the 5’ or 3’ untranslated region. We reviewed the functions and associated OMIM
phenotypes of those genes (https://omim.org/).
Sanger sequencing was used to validate candidate variants (completed in Oumeng V Medical
Laboratory Co., Ltd.). Locus-specific primers used for PCR amplification and direct
sequencing were designed using the online Primer3 program (http://primer3.ut.ee/). Then
Sanger sequencing of PCR products was performed to validate the potential disease-causing
variants with an ABI3500 sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA, USA).23
Literature review and effect prediction of ARSA c.925 mutations
A systematic literature review was performed to obtain published ARSA c.925 mutations in
MLD. The detail process of literature collection and data extraction were shown in figure S1.
Amino acid conservation of ARSA protein in different species was performed by using
MEGA5 and DNAMAN software. All amino acid sequences used in the conservation analysis
were obtained from NCBI Web site (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The effect of the amino
acid changes in ARSA at p.E309 was predicted by using the web server SWISS-MODEL
(https://www.swissmodel.expasy.org).
ARSA expression/mutation vector construction
The human wild-type ARSA cDNA (cloned in the pCMV6 plasmid) was purchased from
Origene (Cat. No. RC204319, Origene, USA). The c.925G mutations (c.925G>A, c.925G>T,
and c.925G>C, as shown in figure S2) were introduced into the ARSA plasmid by using
Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Cat. No. E0552s, NEB, USA). The sequences of mutated
cDNA vectors were confirmed using the ABI3500 sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc.,
Foster City, CA, USA).

Cell culture and transfection
HEK293 cells (CRL-1573, ATCC, VA, USA) were cultured in high-glucose DMEM (Cat. No.
11965092, Life Technologies, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS at 37 and 5% CO2. Cells
were seed in 12-well at an initial density of 2 x 105 cells per well 24 hours before transfection
and were collected 24 hours after the transfection. The transient transfection were performed
by using FuGene HD transfection reagent (Cat. No. E2311, Promega, USA).
Total RNA extraction and RNA sequencing
Total RNA was extracted from HEK293 cells via the RNApure Tissue/Cell Kit (Cat. No.
CW0560, CoWin Bioscience, China). RT-qPCR was performed to validate the
overexpression of ARSA gene by using SYBR Green Master Mix (Cat. No. CW2999, CoWin
Bioscience, China). The expression levels of ARSA genes (forward primer: 5’CTGCTTGAAGAGACGCTGGT -3’, reverse primer: 5’- AAGGTGACATTGGGCAGTGG
-3’) were calculated using the

∆∆Ct method and normalized to the Ct values of the GAPDH

gene (forward primer: 5’- GACAGTCAGCCGCATCTTCT-3’, reverse primer: 5’TTAAAAGCAGCCCTGGTGAC-3’).
RNA sequencing and subsequent bioinformatics analysis were completed by the Oumeng V
Medical Laboratory. RNA sequencing was performed using the same protocol with poly-A
selection of mRNA following the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina TruSeq). Paired-end
150 bp sequencing, which was performed on Illumina HiSeq 2000 instruments, generated
more than 6G clean bases data for each sample. The raw reads were quality checked using
FastQC. Low-quality bases were trimmed with Trimmomatic (parameters TRAILING: 3 and
SLIDINGWINDOW: 4:15).24 HISAT2 was used to compare clean reads to the reference
genome (GRCh37).25-26 Then sequence mapping data (SAM) were converted into bam files
and sorted according to mapped chromosomal location using SAMtools.27 The software
StringTie was used to calculate the gene expression and outputted the standardized TPM
format expression data of all genes in each sample.28
Construction of WGCNAs and detection of hub genes
Expression profiling of all samples were utilized as input data to construct co-expression
networks using the weighted gene WGCNA R package.29 The pickSoftThreshold function
was used to obtain a proper soft-thresholding power (β=3), where the corresponding
Scale-free Topology Fit Index was above 0.9. We calculated the Pearson’s correlation
between modules and cell treatments to identify the relevant module. In general, the module
whose absolute correlation ranked first among all the selected modules was considered the
one related to phenotype. In each co-expression module, genes were ranked according to four
ranking methods in Centiscape2.2 (Degree, stress, Closeness, and Radiality), the overlaps of
the first 30 genes of each ranking method were defined as the hub genes. The modules were

defined as key modules when they had a correlation >0 and p-value<0.05 with at least one of
the four types of cell (c.925G, c.925G>A, c.925G>T, c.925G>C) and used for subsequent
analysis.
Function annotation and enrichment analysis
To identify biological processes and pathways that are significantly enriched by the genes in
selected modules different phenotypes, the gene list of the key modules was analyzed using
the Gene Functional Classification Tool (DAVID) v6.8, which is an online tool for functional
annotation and enrichment analysis to reveal biological features related to large gene lists.30
The online tool Metascape was used to perform annotations of the hub genes from the Gene
Ontology (GO) database and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
database.31
Identification of protein-protein interaction networks
The gene lists from selected modules to build a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network
based on BioGrid6, InWeb_IM7 and OmniPath database in online tool Metascape. Input
correct species (H. sapiens), and choose “Express Analysis” for analysis. Moreover, if the
network contains between 3 and 500 proteins, the “Molecular Complex Detection” (MCODE)
algorithm has been applied to identify densely connected network components. All network
diagrams are generated by Cytoscape.32

Results
Clinical finding
The proband, a 27-month-old boy, was unable to stand or walk independently, had decreased
lower limb muscle strength and muscle tension, and had impaired language function. He was
the second boy of a healthy, nonconsanguineous couple. Before he went to the Neurology
Department of Nanjing Children's Hospital, he received physical therapy for walking
disability.
The proband showed decreased lower limb muscle strength and muscle tension and
electrophysiological changes of multiple peripheral neurogenic lesions on EMG. Abnormal
white matter symmetry signals in bilateral cerebral hemispheres were observed in MRI
images of the proband (figure 1A).
Genetic Finding
We performed exome sequencing of the proband (II-2, figure 1B) and other family members
in a Chinese Han family. We generated more than 17 billion Raw Bases for all samples (I-1
17.64 billion bp, I-2 19.46 billion bp, II-1 21.53 billion bp, II-2 24.75 billion bp,

supplementary table S1). Among the Raw Bases, clean reads rate more than 92% (I-1 92.48%,
I-2 94.9%, II-1 21.53 94.93%, II-2 94.64%, supplementary table S1) and capture efficiency
more than 50% (I-1 62.25%, I-2 57.18%, II-1 63.78%, II-2 63.1%, supplementary table S1).
Mapped to the targeted bases with a mean coverage of more than 100-fold (I-1 102.74-fold,

51535 genetic variants, including 8785 nonsynonymous variants, were identified in either
coding regions or splice sites. The results of the WES test and quality control for all family
members are shown in supplementary table S1-S3. According to the American College of
Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) recommendations, which provides interpretative
categories of sequence variants and an algorithm for interpretation,

it a missense mutation,

c.925G>A in exon 5 of the ARSA gene (figure 1C, supplementary table S4) was identified as
a candidate pathogenic locus. Genotypes of the proband showed a homozygous c.925G>A
mutation, and those of the parents showed a heterozygous c.925G>A mutation (I-1, I-2, figure
1C). His healthy brother did not inherit this mutation (II-1, figure 1C).
ARSA mutation (c.925G>A, c.925G>T, c.925G>C) function
c.925G>A (p.E309K) is a highly conserved in multiple species sequences, suggesting its
structural and functional importance (figure 2A). This mutation was predicted to affect the
protein features and be disease-causing by SIFT, PolyPhen2 and MutationTaster
(supplementary table S4). The 3D structural model analysis showed that glutamate at position
307 was the part in the formation of a disulfide bond. Hence, three missense mutations
(c.925G>A, c.925G>T, c.925G>C) caused amino acid changes (p.E309K, p.E309* and
p.E309Q) and truncated the protein, altering the local charge to prevent the correct

positioning of a sulfate group of the substrate and consequently its hydrolysis (figure 2). The
mutation p.E309* resulted in early termination of translation (figure 2C).
In previous studies, ARSA c.925G (c.925G>A, c.925G>T, c.925G>C) has been reported to
cause late-infancy MLD. As shown in Table 1, one of the 10 reported patients with MLD
disease had adult MLD, and one was diagnosed with juvenile MLD; two patients have had
c.925G>A homozygous mutations (including the proband found in this study), and other
patients had composite heterozygous mutations at this site.10 34-39
Transcriptome and biological analysis
Mock vector (Vector), wild-type ARSA cDNA plasmid (c.925G), and missense mutated
ARSA cDNA plasmid (c.925G>A, c.925G>T, c.925G>C) were transfected into HEK293
cells, RNA-seq and consequent bioinformatics analyses were performed on untreated and
transfected cells (figure 3A). As validated by RT-qPCR, the expression level of ARSA
exceeded 20,000-fold in wild-type ARSA cDNA plasmid-transfected c.925G and three

missense mutation-transfected (c.925G>A, c.925G>T, c.925G>C) cell models over WT and
Vector cells (figure 3B).
An average of 25,280,291 raw reads (a maximum of 21,591,207 and a minimum of
32,554,987) were generated for each samples by RNA-seq. After removing low-quality and
adapter sequences, an average of 25 million clean reads were obtained in each sample. The
average GC content percentages in the samples ranged from 50.67% to 52.42%. The Q30
percentages were more than 93.14% (supplementary table S5). After the low-expression
genes (TPM=0) had been filtered out from all gene expression libraries, 43450 genes were
used for WGCNA analysis.
Twenty-nine co-expression modules were identified in the WGCNA analysis, including the
grey module (ME0). According to the description of WGCNA package, genes in grey were
not included in any module, so the subsequent analysis did not include them. The interactions
among these 28 co-expressed modules (reflected by the connectivity of eigengenes) was
shown as a heatmap of module eigengene adjacency (figure 3C). Then the module-trait
relationships with all traits were calculated by correlating the module’s eigengenes to the
traits of interest (figure 3D) and were used for selection of modules for downstream analysis.
The module-trait relationships showed that several modules were positively correlated with
one or more cell types, and it also showed a clear distinction between the different cell types.
After eliminating pseudogenes and lncRNA, 14, 16, 18 and 14 hub genes were identified for
c.925G, c.925G>A, c.925G>T and c.925G>C, respectively, by overlap of the top 30 genes
according to four ranked methods in Centiscape2.2. These hub genes are annotated to be
involved in processes such as Golgi vesicle-mediated transport, cell junction, calcium binding
and carbohydrate metabolism (supplementary table S6).
Functional enrichment analysis was conducted on the gene lists of 14 modules that were
significantly positively correlated with four groups of samples (c.925G, c.925G>A, c.925G>T,
c.925G>C) using the DAVID Gene Functional Classification Tool. The recommended
threshold enrichment score (>1.3) was to select enriched clusters, and 16 clusters were found
in four groups (Table 2).
The Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) algorithm of Metascape software was applied
to identify densely connected network components. 33 MCODE components were identified
in the 14 modules of the four phenotypes (c.925G, c.925G>A, c.925G>T, c.925G>C). In the

network of protein interactions that was identified, the mutation of c.925G (c.925G>A, 11
components; c.925G>T, 6 components; c.925G>C, 14 components) had more protein
complexes that might interact than the control group (c.925G, 3 components) (figure 4).

Discussion
We report a boy initially manifested as inability to stand alone, decreased lower limb muscle
strength and muscle tone, and electrophysiological changes in multiple peripheral neurogenic
lesions on the EMG. The 2-year-old male child could not sit for a long time, and his language
function was impaired. The MRI results showed white matter lesions. The results of the WES
test showed that an ARSA c.925G>A homozygous mutation site carried by the child was
inherited from his parents. The child diagnosed with MLD disease, from an unaffected family.
The ARSA gene c.925G>A mutation was first reported by the Kreysing research team. The
team found that the c.304del C and c.925G>A mutation site was pathogenic, while
heterozygous mutation site c.925G>A had no typical clinical manifestation in the parents.40 It
has been found that c.925G>A is a complex heterozygous variant with a variety of mutation
sites, leading to the occurrence of MLD disease.34 The homozygous mutation site c.925G>A
was first found by Martina in a 1-year-old and a 6-month-old girl.10 The homozygous
mutation site c.925G>A found in this study is the first such report in Asia.
It has been established that highly conserved amino acid sequences have functional value and
are important for the protein structure, which suggests that they play a key role in determining
the conformation of different domains of a protein. Missense mutation in genes can lead to
changes in protein structure and spatial conformation by encoding amino acid substitutions.
To observe the effect of c.925G>A and other c.925G mutation site (c.925G>T, c.925G>C) on
protein structure and spatial conformation, we conducted a literature review of c.925G site
mutations, compared ARSA and c.925G multi-species protein sequences and 3D structural
model analysis.
The results were compiled according to a literature review of c.925G site mutations
(c.925G>A, c.925G>T, c.925G>C) in which a compound heterozygous mutation or
homozygous mutation causes MLD disease. The c.925G encodes the lysine at position 307 of
the ARSA protein (p.E307), which is highly conserved among different species. It is indicated
that amino acid changes at this position will significantly affect the structure and function of
the ARSA protein. To explore the potential pathogenicity of the mutation sites found in this
study, we used several tools to evaluate the pathogenicity of c.925G (c.925G>A, c.925G>T,
c.925G>C). Multiple mutation evaluation procedures, SIFT, Polyphen-2, and MutationTaster,
were used. The pathogenicity predictions consistently indicated that all three mutations at
p.E307 are detrimental. The crystal structure of human arylsulfatase A shows that the core of
the enzyme is composed of two β-pleated sheets. The major β-pleated sheet is formed by ten

β-strands and is sandwiched between three α-helices on one side and four on the other.41 In
our study, the 3D structural model analysis showed that p.E307 in the formation of a disulfide
bond. Previous studies have described other pathogenic mutations (p.K304R, p.K304N,

p.T306M, p.Y308H, p.E309Q, p.E309*, p.G310D, p.G311S, p.R313Q) in the disulfide bond
region of ARSA,10 which may cause MLD. Our result suggests that p.E307 (p.E307K,
p.E307Q, p.E307*) mutation may led to a change in the spatial steric hindrance and
conformation of the ARSA structure, which may change the spatial location and morphology
of the arylsulfatase A protein. Combined with literature review, multiple sequence alignment
and protein structure analysis, it was found that the mutations of p.E307 (p.E307K, p.E307Q,
p.E307*) may have pathogenic effects on ARSA protein structure.
To further elucidate the pathogenesis of MLD disease, we transferred a wild-type and mutant
vector (c.925G>A, c.925G>T, c.925G>C) into the cell, and designed a MLD missense mutant
cell model. This cell mutation model approach has been successfully applied to several rare
disease studies.42 To more systematically analyze the potential effects of mutations on
intracellular molecular processes, we obtained RNA-seq methods for transcriptome
information from wild-type and mutant transfected cells. Based on transcriptome information,
we further applied multi-dimensional system biology analysis using WGCNA combined with
Hub gene screening and PPI analysis.
WGCNA is a systematic biological method for describing gene association patterns among
different samples. It can be used to identify highly synergistic gene sets based on the
coherence of gene sets and the association between gene sets and phenotypes. We applied
WGCNA to construct a co-expression network for exploring mutations into three different
bases at c.925G (c.925G>A, c.925G>T, c.925G>C). Functional enrichment analysis of ARSA
mutation c.925G>A showed enrichment in pathways of calcium ion-dependent vesicle fusion,
intra-Golgi vesicle-mediated transport, metaion-binding and ion transport. In the ARSA
mutation c.925G>C, the enriched pathways were associated with the mitochondrial inner
membrane, vesicle-mediated transport, and calcium binding. In the ARSA mutation
c.925G>T, enrichment in the carbohydrate metabolism process pathway was found.
Hub genes with high connectivity may have more important biological significance in
modules.43 The hub genes affected by the three mutations of c.925G provided functional
support for the WGCNA results. The c.925G>A module identified hub genes related to Golgi
vesicle-mediated transport (such as TRAPPC6B, COG5), cell junctions (SUN1), and meta
ion-binding related genes (such as ZNF583, TRAPPC6B). The c.925G>C module identified
hub genes related to the mitochondrial inner membrane (LRMP, SMIM24), vesicle-mediated
transport (F5, LRMP, CALCR, AAK1, etc.), calcium binding (F5, CALCR). The c.925G>T
module hub genes were enriched in the carbohydrate metabolism process pathway (BCL2L1,
PSMC5).

PPI network analysis is an effective tool for revealing the principles of cellular organizations
and functions. In this study, PPI analysis showed that the mutation of c.925G (c.925G>A,
c.925G>T, c.925G>C) had more protein complexes that might interact than the control group.
The composition of these protein complexes was mostly related to energy metabolism, ion
binding and other signalling pathways.
The above functional analysis showed that the three mutations of c.925G had a
comprehensive effect on cell function, including energy metabolism, ion binding, vesicle
transport and ion transport (figure S3). Mutations in the ARSA gene result in the production
of defective arylsulfatase A. As a result, inactive arylsulfatase A is transported to the
lysosome, where it is unable to degrade various sulfate esters. This leads to sulfate-ester
accumulation and subsequently to sulfatase deficiency. More than one catastrophic model was
enriched with calcium-related functions, suggesting calcium channel-related drugs could be
used to prevent progression of MLD disease. These results provide a potential pathogenic
mechanism of ASRA mutation in metachromatic leukodystrophy and suggest possible
strategies for diagnosis and treatment.
In conclusion, we identified a late infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy patient carrying on
c.925G>A homozygous mutation in ARSA gene. According to literature and protein structure
analysis, all mutation types of c.925G (c.925G>A, c.925G>T, c.925G>C) in ARSA gene are
pathogenic. To analyze the contribution of mutations located on this site, we constructed
overexpression cell models of wild type ARSA and c.925G mutation genes (c.925G>A,
c.925G>T, c.925G>C). RNA-seq and bioinformatics results indicate that the mutations at
c.925G cause comprehensive molecular changes related to energy metabolism, ion binding,
vesicle transport and transport. These results provided potential pathogenic mechanism of
ASRA mutation in metachromatic leukodystrophy and suggested possible ways in diagnosis
and treatment.
