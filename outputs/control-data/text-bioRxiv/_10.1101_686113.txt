Summary
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified in all eukaryotes and are
most abundant in the human genome. However, the functional importance and
mechanisms of action for human lncRNAs are largely unknown. Using comparative
sequence, structural, and functional analyses, we characterize the evolution and
molecular function of human lncRNA JPX. We find that human JPX and its mouse
homolog, lncRNA Jpx, have deep divergence in their nucleotide sequences and RNA
secondary structures. Despite such differences, both lncRNAs demonstrate robust
binding to CTCF, a protein that is central to Jpx’s role in X chromosome inactivation. In
addition, our functional rescue experiment using Jpx-deletion mutant cells, shows that
human JPX can functionally complement the loss of Jpx in mouse embryonic stem cells.
Our findings support a model for functional conservation of lncRNAs independent from
sequence and structural changes. The study provides mechanistic insight into the
evolution of lncRNA function.

Introduction
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are transcripts over 200 nucleotides in length
that do not code for proteins. In contrast to protein coding transcripts, which map to only
about 1.5% of the human genome, DNA sequences for lncRNA transcripts are estimated
to represent 70% to 90% of the genome (Kapranov et al., 2010). Due to their low levels
of expression and the general lack of functional information, lncRNAs were regarded as
transcriptional noise. Only recently has the high frequency of their occurrence in the
human genome and their direct relevance to various biological processes been
recognized (Fatica and Bozzoni, 2014; Kopp and Mendell, 2018; Perry and Ulitsky,
2016; Rinn and Chang, 2012; Wu et al., 2017). Specifically, lncRNAs are known to be
capable of scaffolding protein complexes and recruiting chromatin modifiers for
transcriptional regulation (Kopp and Mendell, 2018; Mercer and Mattick, 2013;
Ransohoff et al., 2017). Gene expression profiling has revealed highly tissue-specific
transcription of lncRNAs and a large number of lncRNAs that are active during animal
development in humans, mice, flies, and farm animals. (Derrien et al., 2012; Kern et al.,
2018; Sun et al., 2013a; Wen et al., 2016). Importantly, lncRNAs have been implicated in
the evolution of new genes and associated with functions in sexual reproduction (Dai et
al., 2008; Gao et al., 2014; Heinen et al., 2009; Wen et al., 2016). Moreover, lncRNA
functions have been shown to be conserved during embryonic development (Kapusta
and Feschotte, 2014; Ulitsky et al., 2011).
LncRNAs are present in all eukaryotes; however, functions and evolution of the
vast majority of lncRNA genes still remain elusive (Haerty and Ponting, 2014; Hezroni et
al., 2017; Ling et al., 2015; Necsulea et al., 2014). Unlike protein-coding genes, in which
functions are mostly defined by evolutionary conserved coding sequences and their
flanking regulatory elements, lncRNAs are known to have poor sequence conservation

(Cabili et al., 2011; Hezroni et al., 2015; Kirk et al., 2018). Hence, it has been a
challenge to uncover conserved features of lncRNAs and determine underlying
mechanisms for function. RNA secondary structure is one molecular feature that has
recently been recognized to be important for lncRNA function (Delli Ponti et al., 2018;
Fang et al., 2015; Ilik et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2017; Novikova et al., 2012; Smola et al.,
2016). Yet, the direct connection between the structure and function of lncRNAs and
their implications in molecular evolution remain unclear (Johnsson and Morris, 2014; Liu
et al., 2017). Defining this connection has been notoriously difficult due to the lack of
structural and biochemical analysis of evolutionarily related lncRNAs and the complex
nature of their interactions with protein factors.
In this paper, we focus on lncRNAs involved in a mechanism of dosage
compensation known as X chromosome inactivation to determine whether function is
conserved and if molecular features such as RNA sequence and secondary structure
influence conservation. X chromosome inactivation is the evolutionary solution to the
1X:2X dosage imbalance between XY male and XX female mammals. Outside the
lineage of modern mammals, different mechanisms are used to balance the sex
chromosome gene dosage. Interestingly, dosage compensation has evolved
independently in divergent species and frequently uses lncRNAs as key regulators.
Examples include roX1 and roX2 for Drosophila; Rsx for opossum; and Xist/XIST for
mouse and human (Grant et al., 2012; Payer and Lee, 2008; Straub and Becker, 2007;
Wutz et al., 2002). This suggests that RNA, unlike protein, carries functional advantages
that aid and are sometimes prerequisites for biological processes such as gene dosage
controls in developing embryos. Indeed, X chromosome inactivation is controlled by a
genomic region known as the X inactivation center (Xic) that encodes a cluster of
lncRNAs in both human and mouse genomes (Figure S1) (Brockdorff et al., 1992; Brown
et al., 1992). This gene cluster has evolved from a group of protein-coding genes during

the divergence of eutherians and marsupials to become the home of all lncRNAs
involved in X chromosome inactivation (Casanova et al., 2016; Duret et al., 2006;
Elisaphenko et al., 2008; Horvath et al., 2011). It is worthwhile to note that marsupials
(e.g., opossums; Figure S1B) do not have the master regulator lncRNA Xist for X
chromosome inactivation. In the same chromosome locus, marsupials carry the proteincoding gene Lnx3, which does not possess dosage compensation functions or affect the
sex chromosome (Duret et al., 2006; Elisaphenko et al., 2008). However, a marsupial
lncRNA, Rsx, was discovered to play the role of silencing the X chromosome in
opossums. Although Rsx has no obvious sequence homology with Xist, the function of
the two genes appears to be equivalent (Grant et al., 2012; Lee and Bartolomei, 2013;
Sado and Brockdorff, 2013). Thus, the use of lncRNAs for control of mammalian X
chromosome inactivation represents convergent evolution of functions that may be
independent of RNA nucleotide sequences.
We took advantage of a defined molecular mechanism in mouse X chromosome
inactivation which involves the direct binding of a lncRNA known as Jpx with a specific
chromatin insulator protein, CTCF, to initiate X chromosome inactivation (Figure 1A)
(Sun et al., 2013b). This model allowed us to identify the molecular features underlying
the function and evolution of Jpx. In mice, Jpx has been shown to activate Xist
(Carmona et al., 2018; Li et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2013b; Tian et al., 2010). By contrast,
the function of its human homolog, JPX, is unknown (de Hoon et al., 2017; Migeon,
2011). As a lncRNA in humans, JPX is expressed in early female human embryos
(Figure S2A, (Petropoulos et al., 2016)). This indicates that the gene has a role in early
embryogenesis and likely functions similarly to Jpx. Here we will compare mouse
lncRNA Jpx with human lncRNA JPX and determine their homology at the levels of
nucleotide sequences, RNA secondary structures, and molecular functions. Our results

indicate that despite sequence and structural divergence, the two lncRNAs function
through the same biochemical mechanism.

Results
Comparative sequence analysis suggests that human lncRNA JPX is
functional
The molecular features and functional roles of human lncRNA JPX were not
previously known. The GenBank annotation for human lncRNA JPX shows that the gene
(NR_024582) contains five exons, which are similar to its mouse homolog, Jpx (Figure
1B) (Kolesnikov and Elisafenko, 2010; Tian et al., 2010; Tsuritani et al., 2007). Using
total RNA from human ovarian cancer SKOV3iP1 cells, we were able to isolate a primary
JPX transcript spanning exons 1-3, JPX E1-E3. In mice, it has been shown that the
corresponding Jpx E1-E3 is the primary isoform responsible for the function of Jpx in X
chromosome inactivation (Lee et al., 1999; Sun et al., 2013b). More precisely,
nucleotides 1-383 of the Jpx E1-E3 sequence are necessary and sufficient for mouse
lncRNA Jpx binding to CTCF (Sun et al., 2013b). As lncRNA JPX E1-E3 was detected in
human cells, we suspected conservation of gene structure and nucleotide sequence
between JPX and Jpx. To characterize their sequence homology, we performed a
pairwise sequence alignment between the critical 383nt mouse Jpx E1-E3 with the fulllength (343nt) human JPX E1-E3 (Figure 1C). Despite an overall similarity of gene
structure, including five exons in both Jpx and JPX (Figure 1B), the exact sequence
identity of exons 1-3 is approximately 40%, which is much less than the average
nucleotide sequence identity (85%) for protein-coding sequences between humans and
mice (Gibbs et al., 2004; Makalowski et al., 1996)(one-tailed binomial test, P < 10-6).
Interestingly, exon 1 of Jpx and JPX both contain remnants of protein-coding sequences

similar to the chicken UspL, which have recently been reported as possible regulatory
sequences for lncRNA function (Hezroni et al., 2017).
While a lack of sequence conservation is not surprising for noncoding genes
(Necsulea and Kaessmann, 2014; Ponjavic et al., 2007; Ponting and Lunter, 2006), it is
unknown how lncRNAs evolve and how noncoding nucleotide changes affect the
lncRNA function. Taking advantage of fully sequenced genomes of multiple vertebrates,
we searched for other homologous sequences of Jpx E1-E3 and JPX E1-E3 in the
UCSC genome assemblies. Appropriate exon sequences for alignment were obtained
from primates and murine rodents, which allowed us to look into the phylogenetic history
of Jpx. Using the Neighbor-Joining method (Saitou and Nei, 1987), we constructed the
evolutionary tree for Jpx E1-E3 and JPX E1-E3 in ten species (2 rodents and 8
primates), with evolutionary distances calculated from Maximum Composite Likelihood
method (Tamura et al., 2004) (Figure 1D). The rate of Jpx sequence evolution between
mouse and rat is 0.109 substitution per site, which is ~44% lower than the neutral
evolution rate of 0.196 estimated between these two rodents (Cooper et al., 2004; Gibbs
et al., 2004) (one-tailed binomial test, P = 0.000014). This is consistent with our
understanding that Jpx has an important functional role in mice, and thus the sequence
changes have been under substantial constraint in the rodent lineages. By contrast, the
evolutionary distance between rodent Jpx and human JPX is 0.796 substitution per site,
which is ~74% higher than the neutral rate of 0.457 between humans and rodents
(Cooper et al., 2004) (one-tailed binomial test, P < 10-6). A more rapid nucleotide
substitution between human and rodent suggests positive selection acting on the
sequence of human JPX.
We next compared our Jpx/JPX gene tree to the recently published species tree
of primates. The neutral substitution rates in the lineages leading to the hominoid
(human, chimpanzee, and orangutan), as estimated from the common ancestor between

hominoids and Old World Monkeys (vervet monkey, macaque, and olive baboon), are
within the range of 0.026 – 0.027 (Moorjani et al., 2016). By contrast, the corresponding
evolutionary rates of the JPX gene in the same lineages appear to be more variable,
ranging from 0.009 to 0.027. Importantly in the human lineage, the nucleotide change
rate is 0.012, which is two-fold higher than the neutral substitution rate of 0.0058 for
humans (Moorjani et al., 2016) (one-tailed binomial test, P = 0.13). A larger than two-fold
difference in the substitution rates is seen between the human and chimpanzee
branches (bootstrap 80% over 500 replicates), which is notable given that the rates of
evolution on these two lineages are estimated to be very similar with only 1.9%
difference (Moorjani et al., 2016). Such observations suggest that adaptive nucleotide
sequence changes have occurred in the hominoid lineages, which are supportive of a
functional JPX, particularly in the human lineage.
Consistent with a possible role of JPX in regulating XIST within humans, reanalysis of available single-cell RNA-seq data revealed a positive correlation between
JPX and XIST expression levels in human preimplantation embryos, especially in female
cells of the epiblast lineage (Figure S2A; raw data obtained from (Petropoulos et al.,
2016)). Such observations suggest that human lncRNA JPX likely functions as a positive
regulator of XIST. Additionally, data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx)
Project showed sex-dependent expression and a positive correlation between JPX and
XIST expression across 51 female samples (Pearson’s correlation r = 0.783, P < 10-6)
(Figure S2B). Within specific tissue types, JPX and XIST activities in individual samples
also showed positive correlations: r = 0.784 for the breast tissues (n = 290, P < 10-6); r =
0.690 for the pituitary tissues (n = 183, P < 10-6).
These results suggest that human lncRNA JPX is functionally important and that
a detailed analysis of Jpx/JPX would provide a novel experimental model to understand
conservation of function despite sequence diversity.

RNA structural probing reveals divergence of Jpx/JPX homologous
lncRNAs
If human lncRNA JPX shares similar function with its mouse homolog, it is
possible that there is conservation at the RNA structural level despite a nucleotide
sequence divergence. Such conservation has been supported by previous RNA
structure-function studies on well-characterized noncoding RNAs, such as ribozymes
and riboswitches, but thus far there has been limited analysis for lncRNAs (Ilik et al.,
2013; Kirk et al., 2018; Webb et al., 2009). To explore how the sequence determines the
secondary structure of RNA, we performed selective 2’-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by
primer extension (SHAPE) RNA structural probing (Spitale et al., 2013; Wilkinson et al.,
2006). For mouse Jpx, we focused on the functional lncRNA transcript Jpx 34-347 and
designed the reverse primers spanning the 314nt sequence (Figure 2A). Extension
primers were also designed to probe the human lncRNA transcript JPX 1-343 (Figure
2B). We used the SHAPE reagent, 2-methylnicotinic acid imidazolide (NAI), to modify
structured in vitro transcribed RNA and map to residues that are accessible, such as
unpaired or flexible bases (Figure 2C). As has been reported (Ilik et al., 2013; Wilkinson
et al., 2006), sites of nucleotide modification can be identified as stops to primer
extension by reverse transcriptase. Using radiolabeled reverse primers to generate
cDNAs from NAI treated or DMSO treated RNAs, we were able to resolve the modified
unpaired bases by running the reverse transcribed cDNAs through denaturing gel
electrophoresis for sequencing. The intensities of the gel bands are positively correlated
with the NAI modification strengths and thus reveal features of the RNA secondary
structures at single-base resolution. In the SHAPE profiles for the 5’ and 3’ regions of
Jpx 34-347, we observed segments of the base pairing in nucleotides G56-G66 and

A71-C81 (Figure 2C, pex1r panel), and nucleotides C309-C317 (Figure 2C, p2r panel),
suggesting possible stem-loops at these sites. Similarly for the 5’ and 3’ regions of JPX
1-343, we observed the base pairing in nucleotides C38-C46 (Figure 2D, pR3-4),
nucleotides C276-C285 and U306-C311 (Figure 2D, pR1), which suggest corresponding
stem-loop features.
To systemically analyze the lncRNA SHAPE profiles, we derived the SHAPE
reactivity for each nucleotide after measuring band intensity, background (the DMSO
lane) subtraction, and normalization (Ilik et al., 2013). By inputting all the SHAPE
reactivity values into the ViennaRNA program for RNA secondary structure (Lorenz et
al., 2011; Washietl et al., 2012), we were able to derive the most likely structure for Jpx
34-347 and JPX 1-323 based on a linear log model for pairing probabilities
(Zarringhalam et al., 2012). As illustrated in Figure 3A, mouse Jpx 34-347 RNA contains
multiple stem-loops. Overall, about 50% of the nucleotides are base-paired, indicating
that Jpx 34-347 RNA is highly structured. Both the 5’ and 3’ nucleotides, 34-114 and
252-347 respectively, are involved in stem-loop formation, suggesting possible
secondary structural configurations necessary for function. We asked what structural
features human JPX may share with mouse Jpx. As shown in Figure 3B, JPX 1-343
RNA indeed also contains stem-loops with more than 50% of paired bases. However,
the overall structure is obviously different from the mouse Jpx RNA structure (Figure 3).
To determine whether in vitro conditions may limit the RNA secondary structural
probing, we performed SHAPE analysis in vivo with JPX lncRNA modified by NAI in
human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. We note that in vivo RNA structural probing is
particularly difficult on low abundance RNA for which results can be confounded due to
the presence of more abundant RNA in the same sample (Kwok et al., 2013; Xue and Li,
2008). To enrich JPX for in vivo SHAPE profiling, we adapted a cDNA amplification step
using LMPCR (ligation mediated polymerase chain reaction) which has shown to be

instrumental for in vivo RNA structural probing (Kwok et al., 2013; Lucks et al., 2011).
We chose the sequence domain JPX 104-172, which shares 50% nucleotide identity and
corresponds to the mouse Jpx sequence essential for function (Sun et al., 2013b). A
direct comparison between in vitro and in vivo SHAPE profiles of JPX 104-172 showed
overlapping segments representing single-stranded RNA domains (Figure S3A). There
is an overall 70% exact matching between the in vitro and in vivo RNA structural
predictions (Figure S3B), with 76% (22 out of 29) single-stranded nucleotides from the in
vivo structure falling into the loop regions predicted by in vitro SHAPE reactivities
(Figure S3C), supporting that in vitro SHAPE profiling is instructive to determine RNA
secondary structural features. Based on the large differences revealed by the in vitro
SHAPE reactivities for JPX E1-E3 and Jpx E1-E3 (Figure 3), we conclude that human
lncRNA JPX has diverged from mouse lncRNA Jpx in their overall secondary RNA
structures.

LncRNA-protein binding in vitro demonstrates sequence requirements for
RNA function
Given the low conservation of nucleotide sequences and RNA secondary
structures, we asked whether specific domains or motifs might be required for the
molecular functions of Jpx and JPX lncRNAs. Utilizing the known molecular interaction
between mouse Jpx and CTCF, we performed an in vitro RNA electrophoresis mobility
shift assay (EMSA) and tested the binding capacity of Jpx RNA with regard to various
truncation forms (Figure 2A). It has been reported that truncated Jpx RNAs, 220nt Jpx
E1-E2 or 183nt Jpx E2-E3, failed to bind CTCF (Sun et al., 2013b), suggesting that both
halves of Jpx E1-E3 are needed for it to function. We then removed segments of 5’ and
3’ of Jpx E1-E3 and characterized the binding kinetics of mutant Jpx RNAs in

11

comparison to the 383nt Jpx E1-E3. For negative control, we used a 316nt drz-Agam-21 ribozyme RNA from Anopheles gambiae (Webb et al., 2009). As shown in Figure 4A,
with increasing CTCF concentration, the full-length Jpx 1-383 (Red) and the truncated
Jpx 34-347 (Black) both exhibited robust binding. By contrast, the truncated Jpx 115-347
(Blue) and Jpx 34-251 (Pink) failed to bind to CTCF. We conclude that both the 5’
sequence of nucleotides 34-114 and the 3’ sequence of nucleotides 252-347 are
required for Jpx to bind CTCF, and that these regions may be responsible for its
function.
We next asked whether the molecular function of human JPX has diverged from
mouse Jpx, and performed EMSA on JPX 1-343 RNA for its CTCF-binding capacity in
vitro (Figures 4B-C and S4). We use purified recombinant CTCF with the full-length
mouse CTCF protein of 736 amino acids, which is 98% identical with the human CTCF
protein. In vertebrates, CTCF is highly conserved and functioning as a global
transcriptional regulator in all cell types (Ohlsson et al., 2001; Phillips and Corces, 2009).
Therefore, whether human JPX binds to CTCF the same as mouse Jpx-CTCF binding
would inform functional importance and conservation at the molecular level. As shown in
EMSA with increasing concentration of CTCF protein, JPX 1-343 RNA was capable of
binding the CTCF protein and was robustly shifted by CTCF (Figure 4C, left panel). By
contrast, the 316nt control RNA of mosquito ribozyme showed weak interaction only at
the highest concentration of CTCF (Figure 4C, right panel). We looked further into the
binding kinetics of CTCF against various truncation forms of human lncRNA JPX
(Figures 2B & 4B) with the goal of identifying RNA sequence domains critical for binding.
As shown in Figure 4B, all JPX RNA truncations were able to bind CTCF in comparison
to the control RNA (Green). Interestingly, the 5’ truncation form, JPX 19-343 (Black) and
3’ truncation form, JPX 1-267 (Blue), showed stronger binding than the full-length JPX 1343 (Red). Our protein-binding assays therefore indicate that human JPX RNA is

capable of binding to CTCF, and that such a CTCF-JPX interaction can be robust
against removal of JPX 5’ or 3’ RNA sequences. Overall, the EMSA results demonstrate
that human JPX RNA has maintained, or may have even reinforced, its molecular
binding capacity with CTCF protein.
Consistent with our observation of direct RNA-protein binding of Jpx-CTCF and
JPX-CTCF in vitro, genome-wide association studies have reported CTCF-RNA
interactions in both mouse and human cells (Kung et al., 2015; Saldaña-Meyer et al.,
2014). Notably, mouse Jpx RNA was identified as one of the locus-specific interacting
RNAs of CTCF in mouse embryonic stem cells by CLIP-seq (Kung et al., 2015). In
addition, we also found human lncRNA JPX present as one of the RNA transcripts
pulled-down with human CTCF by PAR-CLIP from human bone osteosarcoma U2OS
cells (Supplementary data from (Saldaña-Meyer et al., 2014)). Moreover, RNA-binding
regions (RBR) in CTCF have been recently reported and shown to be essential for the
molecular interaction and function of CTCF in mouse and human cells (Hansen et al.,
2018; Saldana-Meyer et al., 2019), which confirm CTCF binding to endogenous RNAs
and the functional importance of CTCF-RNA binding in gene regulation. Our evidence of
direct binding of CTCF to human JPX RNA similar to CTCF-Jpx lncRNA interaction in
the mouse thus supports the functional importance and conservation of human JPX to its
mouse homolog.

Rescue of Jpx-/+ mES cell viability and morphology by a human JPX
transgene indicates functional complementation
Since mouse lncRNA Jpx activates X chromosome inactivation through its
binding to CTCF (Figure 1A), we therefore asked whether human lncRNA JPX could
function equivalently for X chromosome inactivation. Using a functional complementation

test, we addressed whether the in vivo function of human lncRNA JPX is equivalent to
mouse lncRNA Jpx. We used Jpx-/+ female mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells for this
purpose, an established Jpx-/+ heterozygous knockout cell line. As previously reported,
Jpx-/+ female mES cells die during cell differentiation due to failed X chromosome
inactivation, which is associated with morphology defects and a loss of Xist transcription
(Tian et al., 2010). By introducing Tg(EF1α:JPXE1-E3) transgene expressing JPX E1-E3
transcript into Jpx-/+ mutant female mES cells, we asked whether the cell viability
defects caused by loss of mouse lncRNA Jpx could be rescued by expression of human
lncRNA JPX. As a reference in parallel, we also introduced Tg(EF1α:JpxE1-E3)
transgene expressing Jpx E1-E3 into Jpx-/+ female mES cells. As shown in Figure 5A
(second row), Jpx-/+ female ES cells receiving the vector-only transgene were dying
during mES differentiation, displaying irregular and disaggregated embryonic bodies
(EBs) at Day 4 (white arrows). These phenotypes were rescued by transiently
transfected transgenes overexpressing Jpx E1-E3 (third row) or JPX E1-E3 (bottom
row), with which the mutant cells formed better EBs at Day 4 and showed less
dissociated cells. At Day 8 of mES differentiation, the rescue effects were most obvious.
While wildtype female mES cells receiving the vector-only transgene showed EB
attachment and cell outgrowth; the mutant Jpx-/+ had no attached EBs or cell outgrowth,
and instead, had mostly disintegrated EBs and floating cells in the media. By contrast,
Jpx-/+ female mES cells receiving either Jpx E1-E3 or JPX E1-E3 showed clearly
attached EBs and cell outgrowth comparable to the wildtype control cells, suggesting
complete reversal of cell lethality.
To validate the observed differences in EB morphology, we quantified the cell
viability at Day 4. As shown in Figure 5B, mutant Jpx-/+ cells exhibited viability defect
with ~40% reduction as compared to wildtype female control cells of mES cell
differentiation (one-tailed Student t-test, P < 0.01). In comparison, mutant Jpx-/+ cells

receiving Jpx E1-E3 or JPX E1-E3 were rescued, and cell viabilities in both cases were
significantly elevated (one-tailed Student t-test, P < 0.05), reaching 96% and 86% of the
wildtype level, respectively. To confirm that the phenotypic rescue of Jpx-/+ mutant
female cells was a response to the transgene expression, we assayed the Jpx and JPX
RNA quantities in these transfected Jpx-/+ mutant female cells (Figure 5C, Day 8
shown). Mutant Jpx-/+ cells receiving Jpx E1-E3 strongly expressed mouse Jpx but not
human JPX, and cells that had received JPX E1-E3 were the only ones strongly
expressing human JPX RNA (Figure 5C). We did not observe any adverse defects when
the same transgenes were expressed in wildtype female mES cells (Figure S5). EB
morphology and outgrowth were normal and cell viabilities were comparable to wild type
control cells carrying the empty vector (Figure S5A-B). At the molecular level, the Jpx
E1-E3 transgene in wildtype female cells induced higher Xist expression (Figure S5C,
one-tailed Student t-test, P < 0.01), consistent with previous reports on the trans
activation role of mouse Jpx on Xist (Carmona et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2013b). By
contrast, the JPX E1-E3 transgene did not enhance Xist expression in wildtype female
mES cells, presumably due to the presence of intact endogenous mouse Jpx in these
cells (Figure S5C).
A heterozygous Jpx deletion in the mouse female ES cell compromises overall
Jpx expression, which leads to reduced Xist expression during ES differentiation (Tian et
al., 2010). As shown in Figure 5D, mutant Jpx-/+ mES cells at differentiation Day 8 had
an overall lower level of Xist transcripts (45% of the wildtype level). Expression of Jpx
E1-E3 transgene fully rescued Xist expression to 105% of the wildtype level in Jpx-/+
cells (one-tailed paired Student t-test, P = 0.002), consistent with the trans activation role
of mouse Jpx on Xist (Carmona et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2013b). Expression of the
human JPX E1-E3 transgene in Jpx-/+ mouse cells rescued Xist expression to 93% of
the wildtype level (one-tailed paired Student t-test, P = 0.108). This is above and beyond

the confidence interval of Xist expression in Jpx-/+ female ES cells (13% – 76% of the
wildtype level), indicating that human JPX E1-E3 RNA is capable of activating Xist to
complement the loss of mouse Jpx RNA in the mouse ES cells. Taken together, our
results support that human lncRNA JPX is functionally homologous to mouse lncRNA
Jpx in their molecular roles affecting XCI.

Discussion
Our analyses comparing human lncRNA JPX with its mouse homolog Jpx reveal
large differences in their nucleotide sequences and RNA structures but nevertheless a
conservation in their molecular functions: both human JPX and mouse Jpx RNAs bind
CTCF; human JPX can rescue Jpx-deletion defects in mouse embryonic stem cells.
Therefore, evolutionary constraints on the sequence-structure-function linkage appear to
be more relaxed and complex, consistent with current views on the genome-wide
sequence evolution of noncoding RNA genes (Haerty and Ponting, 2014; Kirk et al.,
2018; Necsulea and Kaessmann, 2014). A signature of positive selection acting on the
human JPX sequence supports adaptive evolution of functional lncRNAs, which have
been described in diverse organisms from Drosophila to mammalian species (Dai et al.,
2008; Heinen et al., 2009; Kutter et al., 2012; Ponting and Lunter, 2006; Wen et al.,
2016).
Early studies have reported that noncoding RNA structure can be retained across
species and could possibly play a role in functional conservation, but similar analyses on
lncRNAs have yet to be comprehensively performed (Ilik et al., 2013; Webb et al., 2009).
To address whether structural conservation contributes into the functional conservation
of Jpx/JPX, in vitro SHAPE analysis of both mouse lncRNA Jpx and human lncRNA JPX
was performed. Upon comparison, the two structures appear divergent yet highly

structured with both having stem-loop formations and ~50% of their nucleotides base
pairing. The divergence seen between these two lncRNAs may be the result of human
lncRNA JPX evolving due to positive selection (Johnsson et al., 2014). This is supported
by our protein-binding assays, which show robust interactions between CTCF and the
human JPX RNA. A comparison of in vivo and in vitro SHAPE analyses on human JPX
104-172 indicated a high percentage of RNA nucleotides reactive to NAI independently
of the cellular microenvironment. This region corresponds to the E1-E2 junction that is
relatively more conserved in sequence and shown to bind with CTCF, thus representing
a possible lncRNA domain important for function. Consistent stem-loop features
obtained from in vivo and in vitro predictions suggest the structural stability of this RNA
domain and support the overall structural divergence observed in vitro for human JPX
E1-E3 and mouse Jpx E1-E3.
The lncRNA-binding capability of CTCF is supported by recent characterizations
of CTCF as an RNA-binding protein with specific functions in mammalian cells (Hansen
et al., 2018; Kung et al., 2015; Saldana-Meyer et al., 2019; Saldaña-Meyer et al., 2014).
Our analyses of JPX/Jpx lncRNA-CTCF binding are also consistent with the earlier
report that Jpx RNA directly binds CTCF in activating Xist expression in mouse
embryonic stem cells (Sun et al., 2013b). To determine whether specific RNA domains
are responsible for binding to CTCF, we compare the binding affinities for the full-length
Jpx E1-E3 RNA and its mutant versions with 5’ and/or 3’ truncations, which show that
both the 5’ (bases 34-114) and 3’ (bases 252-347) are necessary for CTCF-binding.
Human JPX E1-E3 RNA also binds to CTCF, and its binding capacity appears more
robust against sequence deletions: the 5’ truncation mutant JPX 19-343 and the 3’
truncation mutant JPX 1-257 exhibit even stronger binding than the full length JPX 1343. Together, our RNA EMSA results argue that CTCF-lncRNA binding with JPX/Jpx
does not directly depend on sequence specificity.

Functional homology between human JPX and mouse Jpx is further supported
by the complementary test in the mouse Jpx-/+ mutant ES cells. Deleting a single copy
of Jpx gene in female mouse ES cells disrupts Xist upregulation and leads to cell death
during ES differentiation. Exogenous expression of either mouse Jpx lncRNA or human
JPX lncRNA in the mutant cells rescues Xist expression and cell viability. The mouse ES
cell system is most suitable for the functional complementation experiment, because
differentiation of mouse ES cells faithfully recapitulates the upregulation of Xist and the
XCI process; whereas human embryonic stem cells so far are not exhibiting the
establishment of random XCI or the change of XCI state during human ES cell
differentiation (Khan et al., 2017; Patel et al., 2017; Sahakyan et al., 2018). Transient
transfection of mouse Jpx E1-E3 or human JPX E1-E3 was sufficient to increase Xist
expression and rescue the phenotypic defects of Jpx-/+ female cells, consistent with the
trans-acting role of Jpx/JPX RNA on activating Xist. In contrast, transgenic mES cell
lines established from stable integrations of mouse Jpx E1-E3 or human JPX E1-E3
transgenes show poor EB morphologies during ES cell differentiation (Figure S6).
Expression of the transgenic Jpx or JPX RNA appears less efficient and variable
between independent clones, which leads to insufficient rescue of cell viability in Jpx-/+
mutant female mES cells (Figure S7). The differences we observed between transiently
transfected ES cells vs. stable transgenic clones likely reflect the regulatory mechanism
of Jpx that involves the trans-localization of lncRNA molecules and the quantitative
threshold needed for activating Xist (Carmona et al., 2018; Li et al., 2016).
It is interesting to note that human JPX E1-E3 is capable of rescuing Jpx-/+ mES
cell viability similarly as mouse Jpx E1-E3 (Figure 5B; two-tailed paired student t-test, P
= 0.469); but the efficiency of activating Xist is more variable with human JPX E1-E3
than it is with mouse Jpx E1-E3 (Figure 5D). These suggest that human JPX is
complementary to mouse Jpx with regard to essential cellular functions, and that the

genetic divergence may contribute to difference in the specificity in molecular
interactions, which affects the regulatory efficiency on the target gene, i.e. Xist. This is
also consistent with results from the in vitro protein-binding assays using CTCF.
In conclusion, through comparative sequence and functional analyses involving
the homologous human JPX, our results have demonstrated a convergent function of
Jpx/JPX between mice and humans despite a rapid divergence in the nucleotide
sequences and a change of the RNA secondary structures. Our findings suggest that
lncRNAs are capable of maintaining essential roles in embryogenesis and such lncRNA
functions may be resistant to evolutionary constraints at both RNA sequence and
structural levels.

Experimental Procedures
Plasmid Preparation
The Tg(EF1α:JpxE1-E3) construct was generated by PCR-cloning the Jpx
transcript out of the cDNA library prepared from the total RNA of differentiated mES
cells. The Jpx E1-E3 isoform was cloned into pEF1/V5-His vector (Invitrogen Cat#
V92020), which contains an EF-1α promoter for mammalian expression and a T7
promoter for in vitro transcription. In parallel, the Tg(EF1α:JPXE1-E3) construct was
generated by PCR-cloning the JPX transcript out of the cDNA prepared from the total
RNA of human SKOV3iP1 ovarian cancer cells. The JPX E1-E3 isoform was cloned into
the pEF1/V5-His mammalian expression vector the same way as Jpx E1-E3.

RNA Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)
RNA EMSA was carried out as previously described (Cifuentes-Rojas et al.,
2011; Hellman and Fried, 2007; Sun et al., 2013b) using in vitro transcribed RNAs
uniformly labeled with ATP[α-32p] and purified recombinant CTCF protein. Specifically,

Jpx E1-E3 1-383 and truncated RNAs, or JPX E1-E3 full-length and truncated RNAs,
were in vitro transcribed using T7 polymerase and DNA templates PCR-amplified from
Tg(EF1α:JpxE1-E3) or Tg(EF1α:JPXE1-E3) cDNA plasmid. The control RNA, a 316nt
drz-Agam-2-1 ribozyme RNA, was prepared using genomic DNA of Anopheles gambiae
(Webb et al., 2009). Primers used are as follows.

JW_24R – GTTTTTTCGTTTGCCGTTGAAGG
Recombinant CTCF protein was prepared and purified as previously described
(Sun et al., 2013b). Mouse CTCF cDNA corresponding to the full-length 736 amino acids
was cloned with C-terminal 6xHis tag into pFLAG-2 (Sigma). FLAG-CTCF-6xHis protein
was induced in Rosseta-Gami B-cells (EMD Millipore) with 0.2 M of IPTG at room
temperature and was purified with Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) with 50 mM sodium phosphate
(pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl, and 250 mM imidazole. Eluates were dialyzed against 50 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2.5 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM ZnSO4, 1 mM DTT, 0.1%
Tween-20, and 10% glycerol.
For gel shift (EMSA), RNAs were incubated with CTCF protein and the
complexes were resolved in a 5% acrylamide gel. Gel was exposed to a phosphorimage
screen (Molecular Dynamics), scanned with Typhoon phosphorimager (GE Healthcare)
and analyzed with ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). The fraction of the RNAprotein complex was plotted against the concentration of CTCF and fit with a binding
equation.

In Vitro and In Vivo RNA SHAPE (Selective 2’-Hydroxyl Acylation analyzed
by Primer Extension)
RNA SHAPE was performed as previously described (Spitale et al., 2013;
Wilkinson et al., 2006). Specifically, RNAs were in vitro transcribed from a plasmid
expressing either Jpx or JPX (Tg(EF1α:JpxE1-E3) or Tg(EF1α:JPXE1-E3) respectively).
Then 2pmol of purified RNA was denatured, folded, and modified with 1µmol of NAI.
Immediately next was reverse transcription of the RNA and primer extension with γ32P-ATP 5’-labeled reverse primers. Four reactions were setup for each primer
extension: 1) DMSO only negative control, 2) dideoxy-ATP (ddA) in DMSO, 3) dideoxy-

CTP (ddC) in DMSO, and 4) NAI in DMSO. The γ-32P-ATP end-labelled primers and
~2pmol of RNA from the modification step were added and incubated at 95°C for the
2min annealing step followed by a 2°C/sec step-down cooling to 4°C. Reverse
transcription was performed using first-strand cDNA synthesis kit containing
SuperScriptIII® (2 units/µL; Invitrogen, Life Technologies).
In vivo SHAPE was performed as previously described with some modifications
(Kwok et al., 2013; Lucks et al., 2011; Spitale et al., 2013). Briefly, HEK293T cells
transiently transfected with Tg(EF1α:JPXE1-E3) for 24 hours were collected and
incubated at 37°C with NAI at a 10% concentration for every 4x10^6 cells. RNA was
extracted using TRIzol® (Life Technologies) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Reverse transcription was performed with non-radiolabeled reverse primers. In order to
enrich the presence of JPX, cDNA fragments generated during primer extension with
cold primers were amplified using LMPCR (ligation mediated polymerase chain reaction)
(Kwok et al., 2013; Lucks et al., 2011). A linker sequence with a 5' phosphate and 3' 3carbon spacer group was added to the RNA using CircLigaseTM ssDNA ligase
(epicentre) according to manufacturer’s instructions. PCR amplification was performed
with non-radiolabeled forward primer targeting the linker sequence and γ-32P-ATP endlabeled reverse primers.
Samples were resolved on a 10% denaturing poly acrylamide SHAPE Gel
(0.4mm). The gel was dried and placed into a phosphor-imaging cassette for exposure
overnight, and was scanned using a Typhoon phosphorimager. Band intensities and
SHAPE reactivities were calculated using SAFA software (Das et al., 2005; Laederach et
al., 2008). After subtracting the DMSO background from the NAI band intensities, the
average of the top 10% minus the top 2% reactivities was calculated and set to 1. This is
then used to normalize the SHAPE reactivities (Ilik et al., 2013). When aligning SHAPE

For transient transfection, wildtype 16.7 female mES cells and the Jpx-/+ mutant
female mES cells (Tian et al., 2010) were cultured on feeder cells in media containing
LIF (leukemia inhibitory factor); the cells were collected on differentiation Day 0 (D0) and
~1x106 cells were seeded per well of a non-tissue culture treated 6-well plate for
transfection. The mES cells were then transfected with 2µg of GFP plasmid (for visual
confirmation of transfection) and 2.5µg of either empty vector, Tg(EF1α:JpxE1-E3), or
Tg(EF1α:JPXE1-E3) plasmids per well of a 6-well plate according to the Lipofectamine®
2000 (Invitrogen) manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were cultured in feeder-free and LIFfree conditions for differentiation. On Day 1 of mES differentiation, 2mL of the
transfection media is gently refreshed with regular mES media. Cells were viewed on a
fluorescent microscope to assess GFP fluorescence and confirmation of successful
transfection. Once transfections were deemed successful using Lipofectamine® 2000,
GFP plasmid was no longer included during the transient transfection. For analyses,
cells were transferred to tissue culture treated plates on D4 for EB outgrowth and
allowed to grow until D8; and the cells were collected on D4 and D8 to assess viability
and gene expression.
To obtain stable transgenic mES cell lines with transfection, wildtype 16.7 female
mES cells and the Jpx-/+ mutant female mES cells (Tian et al., 2010) were seeded on
feeder cells in 6-well plates at 3x105 cells per well in media containing LIF. The next day
cells were transfected with 2.5µg of either empty vector, Tg(EF1α:JpxE1-E3), or
Tg(EF1α:JPXE1-E3) plasmids per well of a 6-well plate according to the Lipofectamine®
2000 (Invitrogen) manufacturer’s instructions while still in the stem cell state. After 24
hours, an entire well of cells were treated with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and transferred to a
10cm dish of Neo-resistant feeder cells. Since the plasmids contain the Neomycinresistance gene, media was switched to G418 (400ug/mL) + LIF selection media to
select for cells that had stable integration of the transgenes. The medium of the cells

was changed every day and after 19 days, colonies were picked and treated with 0.25%
trypsin-EDTA to break up colonies and then transferred to a 24-well plate of Neoresistant mEFs and grown out. When confluent, half of a 24-well was stocked and the
other half was used for PCR screening of successful integration of plasmid. For
differentiation, ~5x105 cells were seeded per well of a non-tissue culture treated 6-well
plate without LIF and allowed to grow until Day 4 when they were transferred to tissue
culture treated 6-well plates for EB outgrowth. Cells were collected on D4 and D8 to
assess viability and qPCR analysis.

Cell Death Assay
On Day 4 of mES differentiation, supernatant and embryoid bodies (EBs) were
collected, spun down, and then broken up with 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA. Cells were then
resuspended in 1mL of mES media and 20µL is taken from each sample for staining with
trypan blue. Cells were counted on a Countess™ II FL Automated Cell Counter and cell
viability was recorded. For Day 8 of mES differentiation, supernatant and attached cells
from EB outgrowth were collected, spun down, and treated with 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA
before resuspended in 1mL of mES media for cell count.

Quantitative Real-Time PCR
Cells from one well of a 6-well plate were spun down and resuspended in 1mL
TRIzol® (Life Technologies) for each respective sample. RNA was extracted and
residual genomic DNA was removed with TURBO™ DNase (Ambion, Life Technologies)
treatment according to manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse transcription of RNA to
cDNA was performed using SuperScriptIII® (Invitrogen, Life Technologies) according to
manufacturer’s instructions. Real-time PCR for Jpx, JPX, Xist and Gapdh RNA

Figure Legends
Figure 1. Comparative sequence analysis of mouse lncRNA Jpx and human
lncRNA JPX
(A) Model of mouse lncRNA Jpx mechanism. LncRNA Jpx is transcribed upstream of
Xist, removes CTCF from the Xist promoter, and activates Xist. This activation is dosedependent – Jpx titrates away CTCF only when present in 2-fold excess, such as in
female cells, and is insufficient to activate Xist in male cells (Sun et al., 2013b).
(B) Mouse Jpx (Top) and human JPX (Bottom) gene structures and transcript isoforms.
The 383nt transcript of mouse Jpx E1-E3 is required for function (Sun et al., 2013b),
which corresponds to the 343nt transcript of human JPX E1-E3.
See also Figures S1 and S2.
(C) Sequence alignment of mouse Jpx (Top) and human JPX (Bottom) transcripts;
exons 1 (Blue) – exon 2 (Black) – exon 3 (Orange) analyzed by Clustal 2.1 (Larkin et al.,
2007) and the alignment was manually adjusted. Asterisks mark the identical
nucleotides. Pink bars label the highly conserved regions between Jpx and its ancestral
protein homolog UspL (Hezroni et al., 2017). ‘ATG’ in green and ‘TAA’ in red mark
potential start and stop codons, respectively.
(D) Evolutionary relationships of taxa analyzed by MEGA7. Sequences were obtained
from the UCSC whole genome assemblies and the evolutionary history was inferred
using the Neighbor-Joining method (Saitou and Nei, 1987). The tree is drawn to scale,
with branch lengths (next to the branches) in the same units as those of the evolutionary
distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed
using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method (Tamura et al., 2004) and are in the
units of the number of base substitutions per site.

Figure 2. Functional domain mapping and RNA structure probing
(A) Different length in vitro transcribed RNA corresponding to the coverage of Jpx.
Mouse lncRNA 220nt E1-E2 or 183nt E2-E3 (Orange) is not sufficient for protein binding
in vitro (Sun et al., 2013b). The mouse 383nt functional Jpx transcript and its truncated
forms (Green) are assayed with RNA EMSA. Red arrows indicate positions of the
reverse primers used in SHAPE.
(B) Different length in vitro transcribed RNA corresponding to the coverage of JPX. A
full-length 343nt JPX transcript and its truncated forms (Green) are assayed with RNA
EMSA. Red arrows indicate positions of the reverse primers used in SHAPE.
(C) Mouse Jpx RNA structure probing by SHAPE: polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(PAGE) resolves RNA footprint after treatment of RNA by either DMSO (control) or
SHAPE modification reagent NAI (Spitale et al., 2013), followed by RNA reverse
transcription using primers indicated and RNA hydrolysis.
(D) Human JPX RNA structure probing by SHAPE.
(C-D) At least two replicates were performed for each reaction and representative gel
images are shown. Band intensity and corresponding nucleotide positions were
integrated with SAFA software (Das et al., 2005; Laederach et al., 2008). SHAPE
reactivities reflect single-stranded (highly reactive) and double-stranded (not reactive)
states at individual nucleotides. Nucleotide labels correspond with NAI modified
nucleotides.

Figure 3. RNA secondary structures of mouse Jpx and human JPX derived from
SHAPE reactivity
(A) SHAPE reactivities at individual nucleotides of mouse Jpx were normalized to a
scale of 0 to 1.9.
(B) SHAPE reactivities of human JPX were normalized to a scale of 0 to 2.4.

Figure 4. Mouse Jpx RNA and human JPX RNA are capable of binding to CTCF
(A) Binding isotherm for CTCF-Jpx from RNA EMSA. Binding curve was plotted as the
percent bound against CTCF concentration and was fit by a nonlinear regression to a
binding isotherm. The Jpx 1-383 (Red) and the truncated Jpx 34-347 (Black) both show
robust binding, whereas 5’-truncated Jpx 115-347 (Blue) and 3’-truncated Jpx 34-251
(Pink) show weak or non-specific binding as compared to a 316nt control RNA (Green)
from the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae (Webb et al., 2009).

(A) Overexpression of Jpx and JPX RNA rescues outgrowth defect in Jpx-/+ female
mutant ES cells. Wildtype (WT) control and Jpx-/+ female mES cells transfected with
vector only, Tg(EF1α:JpxE1-E3), or Tg(EF1α:JPXE1-E3). Representative brightfield
images are shown of cultures on day 0, 4, and 8 of mES differentiation. Black arrows
indicate normal EBs present in cultures. White arrows indicate disintegrating EBs in the
Jpx-/+ cultures.
(B) Rescue of the cell viability defect in the Jpx-/+ mutant cells. At least three
independent transfections were performed and average viability ± SEM are shown (*, P
< 0.05 and **, P < 0.01 from one-tail paired Student t-tests in comparison to ‘Jpx-/+;
Vector’).
(C) Overexpression of Jpx and JPX achieved by Tg(EF1α:JpxE1-E3) and
Tg(EF1α:JPXE1-E3), respectively, in the Jpx-/+ mutant mES cells. At least three
independent transfections were performed and qRT-PCR of Jpx expression (left panel)
and JPX expression (right panel) were normalized to Gapdh mRNA. Average expression
± SEM are shown.
(D) Xist RNA expression rescued by Jpx RNA overexpression. The qRT-PCR of Xist
expression was normalized to Gapdh mRNA and is shown relative to the WT level (set
to “1”). Average expression ± SEM are shown from at least three independent
transfections (*, P < 0.05 and **, P < 0.01 from one-tail paired Student t-tests in
comparison to ‘Jpx-/+; Vector’).

(B) Genomic map of lncRNAs in the mouse Xic locus and comparison with the
orthologous region in human, opossum, chicken, and frog. LncRNA genes Ftx, Jpx, Xist,
Tsix, and Tsx are shown in solid colors with the TSX pseudogene in humans shown in
hatched blue. Protein-coding genes Xpct, Cnbp2, Chic1, Wave4, UspL, Lnx3, and Fip1/2
are in black with border-color matching the color of their homologous noncoding gene.
Species divergence times are estimated in Mya (Million years ago), as indicated at the
internal branches of the simplified phylogenetic tree. Orthologous genomes not drawn to
scale; consistent with (Duret et al., 2006; Elisaphenko et al., 2008; Horvath et al., 2011).

(A) No morphological defect detected in cells overexpressing Jpx or JPX RNA. Wildtype
(WT) control female mES cells transfected with vector only, Tg(EF1α:JpxE1-E3), or
Tg(EF1α:JPXE1-E3). Images for WT with vector are the same ones shown in Figure 5,
since the overexpression with WT cells was performed in parallel within the same
experiments as the Jpx-/+ mutant cells.
(B) WT mES cells overexpressing Jpx or JPX RNA have comparable viability with that of
WT mES cells transfected with vector only. At least three independent transfections
were performed and average viability ± SEM are shown.
(C) No reduction of Xist RNA expression caused by overexpression of Jpx or JPX RNA.
The qRT-PCR of Xist expression was normalized to Gapdh mRNA and is shown relative
to the WT level (set to “1”). Average expression ± SEM are shown from at least three
independent transfections (**, P < 0.01 from one-tail paired Student t-tests in
comparison to ‘WT; Vector’). An increase of Xist expression by Jpx overexpression is
consistent with previous reports (Carmona et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2013b).

Figure S6. ES differentiation and EB outgrowth of stable transgenic mES cells
with overexpression of Jpx/JPX.
Two independent clones from each of stable transfection of Jpx and JPX transgenes in
wildtype and Jpx-/+ female mutant ES cells. Representative brightfield images for Day 4
(EB formation) and Day 8 (EB outgrowth) of differentiated ES cells are shown for
Wildtype (WT) control and Jpx-/+ female mES cells stably transfected with vector only,
Tg(EF1α:JpxE1-E3), or Tg(EF1α:JPXE1-E3). Black arrows indicate normal EBs present
in cultures. White arrows indicate disintegrating EBs in the Jpx-/+ cultures.

(A) Expression of Jpx in mES cells carrying stable transgenes. Two independent clones
for each: wildtype female mES cells (WT) with vector only; WT with Tg(EF1α:JpxE1-E3);
WT with Tg(EF1α:JPXE1-E3), and mutant female mES cells (Jpx-/+) with vector only;
Jpx-/+ with Tg(EF1α:JpxE1-E3); Jpx-/+ with Tg(EF1α:JPXE1-E3). Bars represent the
average of at least two qRT-PCR plate replicates of Jpx expression normalized to
Gapdh for each sample. Technical replicate average expression ± SEM are shown.
(B) Expression of JPX in the same mES cells carrying stable transgenes as in (A). Bars
represent the average of at least two qRT-PCR plate replicates of JPX expression
normalized to Gapdh for each. Technical replicate average expression ± SEM are
shown.
(C) Total live cell count on ES differentiation Day 8 for the mES cells carrying stable
transgenes. Two independent clones for each type are as analyzed in (A) & (B). All
samples have started with the same number of ~5x105 undifferentiated mES cells.
