Abstract

33

The immune systems of free-living mammals such as humans and wild mice display a

34

heightened degree of activation compared with laboratory mice maintained under artificial

35

conditions. Here, we demonstrate that releasing inbred laboratory mice into an outdoor enclosure

36

to mimic life in a natural environment alters the state of immunity. In addition to enhancing the

37

differentiation of T cell populations previously associated with pathogen exposure, we found that

38

outdoor release of mice led to an increase in circulating granulocytes. However, rewilded mice

39

were not infected by pathogens previously implicated in immune activation. Rather, changes to

40

the immune system were associated with an altered composition of the microbiota, and fungi

41

isolated from rewilded mice were sufficient to increase circulating granulocytes. These findings

42

establish an experimental procedure to investigate the impact of the natural environment on

43

immune development and identify a role for sustained fungal exposure in determining

44

granulocyte numbers.

Introduction

48

The house mouse is the most prevalent mammalian model organism used in biomedical

49

research and has enabled fundamental advances in basic immunology. Yet, this ubiquitous model

50

fails to recreate certain aspects of human immunity. Inbred laboratory mice and adult humans

51

differ in the proportion of leukocyte subsets, transcriptional responses to microbial challenges,

52

and other immune parameters (Masopust et al., 2017; Tao and Reese, 2017). Such differences

53

may limit the predictive value of experiments with mice when studying complex inflammatory

54

and infectious diseases, resulting in significant shortcomings in translating laboratory

55

observations to humans.

56

Recent findings suggest that this shortcoming of the rodent model may be due to the

57

specific pathogen free (SPF) environment in which they are maintained. Wild mice and pet store

58

mice, both of which are exposed to a litany of pathogens that are typically excluded from SPF

59

facilities, display an abundance of differentiated memory T cells that more closely resembles the

60

state of immunity in adult humans (Abolins et al., 2017; Beura et al., 2016; Choi et al., 2019).

61

Similarly, transferring embryos from lab mice into wild mice generates commensal- and

62

pathogen-exposed offspring (wildlings) that more faithfully recreate human immunity than

63

standard SPF mice, including the unresponsiveness to immunotherapies that failed in clinical

64

trials (Rosshart et al., 2019). Sequentially infecting SPF mice with 3 viruses and a helminth shifts

65

the gene expression profile of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) towards that of pet

66

store mice and adult humans (Reese et al., 2016), further highlighting the role for pathogen

67

experience in normalizing the immune system. SPF mice are also distinguished from free-living

68

mammals by the lack of exposure to potentially immuno-stimulatory members of the microbiota

69

that are absent in a laboratory animal facility. For example, the offspring of germ-free mice

70

inoculated with ileocecal contents from wild mice display increased resistance to influenza

71

infection and colorectal tumorigenesis (Rosshart et al., 2017). However, the specific effect of the

72

naturally-acquired microbiota on immune development is unclear, and the non-bacterial

73

members of the wild microbiota such as fungi have not been examined in detail.

74

We recently described a mesocosm system in which SPF mice are ‘rewilded’ through

75

controlled release into an outdoor enclosure facility (Leung et al., 2018). In contrast to

76

approaches that rely on catching wild mice, our experimental system allows us to control

77

genetics and the timing of environmental exposure by releasing lab-bred mice into a natural

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/742387; this version posted December 9, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

78

environment. We can thus systematically compare genetically defined mice maintained outdoors

79

with control mice of the same genotype kept in a conventional animal facility. Another key

80

feature of the enclosure is that a zinced iron wall excludes predators and rodents harboring

81

disease-causing infectious agents, while allowing exposure to natural soil, vegetation, and

82

weather. Mice rewilded through transient release into the enclosure acquire a bacterial

83

microbiota characterized by increased diversity and display heightened susceptibility to helminth

84

infection (Leung et al., 2018).

85

In a companion manuscript (Lin et al), we describe deep immune-profiling of rewilded

86

mice to identify a series of changes that occur to the immune system upon exposure to the

87

natural environment, and apply computational analyses to infer the impact of genetic and

88

environmental variables. Here, we tested the hypothesis that colonization by microorganisms

89

present in the natural environment contribute to the maturation of the immune system that occurs

90

in free-living mammals. We found that rewilded mice display an increase in central and effector

91

T cells similar to pet store mice infected with pathogens. We also identified a new feature, an

92

increase in granulocyte populations in the blood and lymph node. These changes were not

93

associated with pathogen infection, and instead, were associated with an altered gut microbiota

94

characterized by a substantial increase in fungi. Colonization of lab mice with the model fungus

95

Candida albicans or fungi isolated from rewilded mice recreated the expansion of granulocytes.

96

These findings implicate fungi and other members of the gut microbiota in the maturation of the

97

immune system, and suggest that differences between lab mice and humans are due, in part, to

98

lack of colonization by environmental microbes.

RESULTS

101

Rewilding increases the maturation of lymphocytes

102

To determine the consequences of microbial colonization and exposure to the natural

103

environment on the steady-state immune system, we applied multicolor flow cytometry to

104

analyze the immune cell composition of blood and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) from SPF

105

mice aged 6-8 weeks old at the time of release into the enclosure and captured 6-7 weeks later.

106

Details of the cohort of rewilded mice are described in the Methods and includes male and

107

female wild-type C57BL6/J mice, and also an additional cohort of mice harboring mutations in

108

inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) genes (Atg16L1 and Nod2) described in the companion study

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/742387; this version posted December 9, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

109

(Lin et. al.). Matched control mice were maintained under SPF conditions in the institutional

110

vivarium, herein referred to as lab mice. The initial flow cytometry analyses were performed on

111

all rewilded and lab mice as genotype did not affect the outcome (Lin et. al.). We provide the

112

detailed breakdown by Atg16L1 and Nod2 mutation status in subsequent analyses.

113

In contrast to adult humans and pet store mice, SPF mice and human neonates lack

114

differentiated memory CD8+ T cells harboring CD44 and other markers of antigen experience

115

(Beura et al., 2016). We found that release into the outdoor enclosure led to the acquisition of

116

these signatures of differentiation in T cells from the blood and MLNs. Compared with lab

117

control mice, rewilded mice had CD8+ T cells with surface markers identifying them as

118

CD62LloCD44hi effector memory (T EM ) and CD62LhiCD44hi central memory (T CM ) populations,

119

and a corresponding decrease in CD62LhiCD44lo naïve T cells (Fig. 1A to B). Similar increases

120

in differentiated CD4+ T cell populations were observed in rewilded mice (fig. S1, A to B). We

121

also found an increase in CD8+ and CD4+ T cells expressing activation markers KLRG1 and

122

CD25, respectively (Fig. 1C, and fig. S2C). Another striking feature of pet shop mice is the

123

increase in mucosally-distributed T cells compared with lab mice. Histological examination of

124

the small intestine from rewilded mice revealed an increased number of CD8+ cells (Fig. 1D).

125

Despite these features of enhanced immune activation, we did not detect inflammatory lesions in

126

intestinal sections (Fig. 1D). Thus, rewilding is associated with a general enhancement in T cell

127

maturation resembling observations made in pet store mice.

128
129

Rewilding leads to an increase in granulocytes

130

We complemented the above flow cytometric and microscopic analyses of T cells by

131

performing RNA-Seq on MLNs from the same lab and rewilded mice described above. 112

132

genes were differentially regulated by >1.5-fold, the majority of which have known immune-

133

related functions and were upregulated in the rewilded condition (Fig. 2A). Consistent with the

134

aforementioned changes in T cells, pathway analyses indicated that release into an outdoor

135

enclosure increased the expression of genes involved in lymphocyte signaling, differentiation,

136

and migration. Other differentially regulated genes represented pathways associated with

137

polarization of myeloid cell types, such as IL-12 production and iNOS signaling (Fig. 2A). Wild

138

mice have been shown to harbor changes in myeloid sub-populations (Abolins et al., 2017).

139

Therefore, we examined the flow cytometry data for potential changes to non-lymphocyte cell

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/742387; this version posted December 9, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

140

types. We found a striking increase in the side scatter high (SSChi) fraction of PBMCs and cells

141

harboring myeloid markers in rewilded mice compared with lab mice, indicating that release into

142

the outdoor enclosure induced an enrichment in granulocytes (Fig. 2B). Similarly, we observed

143

an increase in both the proportion and total numbers of neutrophils in the MLNs of rewilded

144

mice (Fig. 2C). These findings indicate that rewilding leads to substantial changes in granulocyte

145

numbers and identifies expansion of this leukocyte subset as another key difference in addition to

146

differentiated T cells between the immune system of lab mice and mice exposed to the natural

147

environment.

148
149

Lymph node cells from rewilded mice display enhanced responses to microbial antigens

150

The ability of immune cells to respond to microbes can be assessed by measuring

151

cytokine production upon stimulation with antigens ex vivo. At the time of sacrifice, we

152

distributed single cell suspensions of MLNs from rewilded and lab mice into 96-well plates pre-

153

coated with a panel of UV-killed microbes (Fig. 3A) that are frequently found in the soil,

154

surfaces of the human body, or both: Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Clostridium

155

perfringens, Candida albicans, Bactroides vulgatus, and Staphylococcus aureus. We also

156

included PBS as a negative control to establish baseline production of soluble factors and

157

αCD3/CD28 beads as a positive control that non-specifically activates T cells. A multiplex bead

158

array was used to quantify 13 cytokines and chemokines in the supernatant following 48-hour

159

incubation.

160

MLN cells derived from rewilded mice responded to microbial or T cell stimulation by

161

secreting generally higher amounts of cytokines and chemokines compared with cells derived

162

from lab mice (Fig. 3B). The exact cytokines that were over-produced were specific to the

163

microbial stimulant, although some general trends include 2–10-fold increases in IL-17, CXCL1,

164

CCL3, and IL-10. Ex vivo stimulation with the model fungus C. albicans, which frequently

165

colonizes the gastrointestinal tract of humans, led to a particularly striking difference between

166

cells from rewilded versus lab mice. These results suggest that immune cells of rewilded mice

167

are in a hyperactivated state due to exposure to microbes, including fungi.

168
169

Rewilded mice display differential colonization by microbes

170

Pet store mice and wild mice harbor a multitude of pathogens, some of which are lethal

171

when transmitted to co-housed lab mice (Beura et al., 2016). Rewilded mice are predicted to

172

display reduced exposure to disease-causing pathogens because our enclosure prevents contact

173

with wild rodents. We did not trap a single rodent other than our released lab animals during the

174

entirety of the experiment. To screen for pathogen exposure, we subjected representative mice to

175

a comprehensive serology panel similar to the one that identified the presence of infections in pet

176

store mice (Beura et al., 2016). Rewilded mice were sero-negative for all 24 of the pathogens

177

tested in this panel (Table S1A). Also, an extended PCR-based analysis that includes a skin swab

178

was negative for most agents (see below), and we did not detect Tritrichomonas protozoan

179

species recently shown to mediate expansion of granulocytes in mice (Chudnovskiy et al., 2016)

180

(Table S1B).

181

Through the above PCR-based assay, several agents were detected in a subset of rewilded

182

mice (15-95%) that may be considered opportunistic pathogens, although these microbes are

183

often described as commensals that are part of the microbiota depending on the context.

184

Staphylococcus aureus was detected in the stool of most of the rewilded mice examined. S.

185

aureus is a commensal bacterium of the skin in humans and typically not considered a

186

gastrointestinal pathogen, although fecal-oral transmission may be important for spread of

187

antibiotic resistant strains associated with invasive diseases in humans and can be found in the

188

intestines of mice following experimental inoculation (Kernbauer et al., 2014b). Sequencing of

189

the S. aureus strain we isolated from a representative rewilded mouse revealed the presence of an

190

intact β-hemolysin gene that was not disrupted by prophage φSa3, which encodes immune

191

modulatory proteins that are highly human specific, indicating that rewilded mice are likely

192

colonized by an animal strain rather than a clinical isolate (McCarthy et al., 2012; Price et al.,

193

2012) (Table 2). We found that a few of the mice within our SPF facility harbored S. aureus,

194

suggesting that this bacterium was already present in a subset of mice prior to release into the

195

outdoor enclosure and was spread within the enclosure. Thus, the presence of S. aureus is not

196

unique to the rewilding conditions. The PCR panel also indicated that a subset of rewilded mice

197

harbored other microbes that are frequently found in SPF facilities, such as Proteus and

198

Klebsiella species that belong to the Enterobacteriaceae family of pathobionts (Table S1B). We

199

were able to isolate Enterobacteriaceae species including Citrobacter koseri from stool of

200

rewilded mice plated on MacConkey agar, which selects for Gram-negative bacilli from the gut.

201

We inoculated mice with pooled Enterobacteriaceae species isolated from rewilded mice, and

202

although we detected colonization, T cell and granulocyte population were unchanged (fig. S2, A

203

to B). Therefore, Enterobacteriaceae species are unlikely to be sufficient to mediate the changes

204

to the immune system observed in rewilded mice.

205

We next turned our attention to other components of the microbiota as a potential source

206

of immune activation. 16S rDNA sequencing of stool samples indicated that rewilding was

207

associated with enrichment of Bacteroides and related taxa, and a decrease in Firmicutes such as

208

Lactobacillus and Faecalibaculum species (Fig. 4A-D). However, these changes were modest

209

when considering the previously reported large increase in Bacteroides abundance in the

210

microbiota of wild mice compared with SPF mice (Rosshart et al., 2017), likely reflecting the

211

fact that in our system, adult mice are released into the wild environment with an intact

212

microbiota. Although we did not detect a change in the number of taxa represented in rewilded

213

mice compared with lab mice (Fig. 4B), it is possible that the coding capacity of the microbiota

214

is altered following release into the outdoor enclosure. Therefore, we performed shotgun

215

sequencing on a subset of WT mice. Principle coordinate analysis (PCA) indicated that the

216

community of microbes segregate by environment (lab versus wild) (Fig. 4E). 184 gene families

217

were identified as differentially regulated, many of which were attributed to the Parabacteroides

218

genus and are associated with metabolic processes (fig. S3A). Together with the 16S sequencing

219

results, these findings indicate that the composition and gene content of the bacterial microbiota

220

is different in lab and rewilded mice.

221

Our experiments in which we quantified cytokine production by antigen-stimulated MLN

222

cells suggest that rewilding is associated with reactivity to fungi. We mined the shotgun

223

sequencing reads for fungal genomes and found that samples from rewilded mice included

224

sequences corresponding to fungal taxa such as Candida (fig. S3B). Quantification of fungal

225

burden by qPCR of the conserved internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of ribosomal RNA on

226

the same samples as above indicated that rewilded mice harbor a significant increase in intestinal

227

colonization by fungi compared with lab mice (Fig. 4F). These findings raise the possibility that

228

acquisition of fungi contribute to changes in immunity. Below, we analyze the effect of Atg16l1

229

and Nod2 mutations on immune parameters, and subsequently examine the effect of introducing

230

fungi into lab mice.

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/742387; this version posted December 9, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

231
232

Atg16L1 and Nod2 mutations are associated with signs of disease but do not affect immune

233

cell populations

234

ATG16L1 and NOD2 are among the most highly investigated susceptibility genes for IBD,

235

an inflammatory disorder of the gut that is associated with alterations in the microbiota

236

(Wlodarska et al., 2015). Inhibition of ATG16L1, which mediates the cellular degradative

237

process of autophagy, leads to excess inflammasome activity and epithelial defects in models of

238

intestinal inflammation (Cadwell et al., 2008; Cadwell et al., 2010; Lassen et al., 2014; Murthy et

239

al., 2014; Saitoh et al., 2008). NOD2 is a cytosolic bacterial sensor that is important for host

240

defense, as demonstrated by the heightened sensitivity of Nod2-/- mice to inflammation and

241

mortality during oral infection by the extracellular Gram-negative pathogen Citrobacter

242

rodentium (Kim et al., 2011). Although NOD2 can function upstream of ATG16L1 to promote

243

immunity against intracellular bacteria or antigen presentation (Chu et al., 2016; Cooney et al.,

244

2010; Travassos et al., 2010), Atg16l1 mutant mice display enhanced immunity towards C.

245

rodentium (Marchiando et al., 2013; Martin et al., 2018), indicating that mutations in these genes

246

can lead to different outcomes when responding to microbial colonization of the gut. Therefore,

247

we included both mice harboring the IBD variant of Atg16l1 (T316A) and Nod2-/- mice in the

248

cohort of animals released into the enclosure.

249

Only a subset of mice in the enclosure displayed any sign of disease. Rewilded

250

Atg16l1T316A homozygous (5 out of 24) and heterozygous mice (1 out of 27) presented with

251

diarrhea, and none of the other genotypes of rewilded mice or lab mice showed watery stool.

252

Interestingly, all the Atg16l1 mutant mice with diarrhea were collected during the second week

253

of the capture (Fig. 5A). Although diarrhea was not observed in Nod2-/- mice at any point during

254

the experiment, many of them failed to gain weight following release into the enclosure (Fig. 5B).

255

Despite these observations, we did not detect intestinal inflammation by histopathology in small

256

intestinal or colonic tissue sections under any condition (data not shown).

257

Next, we examined whether mutation in these IBD genes affect the expansion of

258

differentiated T cells and myeloid cells, the focus of this study. We found that these leukocyte

259

populations in the blood displayed similar increases in rewilded Atg16l1 and Nod2 mutant mice

260

as their wild-type counterparts (Fig. 5C-D). We also examined whether Atg16l1 and Nod2

261

mutant mice differ in their microbiota composition. The results from breaking down the 16S

262

analyses by genotype were similar to those from analyses of the pooled data in Figure 3.

263

Generally, genera that were enriched or reduced in rewilded WT mice were also enriched or

264

reduced in rewilded Atg16l1 and Nod2 mutant mice, and the total number of observed taxa were

265

similar across all conditions (fig. S4A-B).

266

The more striking effect of genotype was on fungal colonization. We found that lab

267

Atg16l1 mutant mice displayed expansion of fungi to levels similar to rewilded mice (Fig. 5E).

268

This expansion in the lab environment potentially reflects the role of ATG16L1 in the antifungal

269

pathway of LC3-associated phagocytosis (Akoumianaki et al., 2016; Martinez et al., 2015;

270

Oikonomou et al., 2016). Separating mice by genotype revealed that all of the rewilded mice

271

regardless of genotype had similar levels of fungal colonization. Rewilded Nod2-/- mice had a

272

similar expansion of fungi as rewilded WT mice. Rewilded WT mice displayed a 150-fold

273

increase in fungal load compared with lab WT mice (Fig. 5E). Given the striking difference in

274

the fungal burden between lab and rewilded WT mice, we focused the remainder of this study on

275

examining the identity of these fungi and their contribution to changes in leukocyte populations.

276
277

Microbial colonization induces granulocytes expansion

278

The effects of rewilding could be a response to a number of possible environmental

279

variables, including diversification of diet and activity levels outdoors (e.g., (Budischak et al.,

280

2018)). To determine the extent to which the enhanced activation and maturation of the immune

281

system was due to changes in microbial exposure, germ-free mice were reconstituted with

282

microbiota through inoculation with cecal contents from rewilded and lab mice, and then blood

283

and MLNs harvested from their offspring were analyzed by flow cytometry. We chose 3

284

representative lab and rewilded WT mice (defined as within a standard deviation of the average

285

number of blood granulocytes in the respective conditions) as donors of cecal contents. Mice

286

harboring the microbiota of rewilded mice displayed an increase in granulocytes including

287

neutrophils (Fig. 6, A and B). However, this increase was modest compared with the rewilded

288

mice that served as donors. 16S rDNA sequencing showed that the bacterial community

289

structures were preserved in the offspring of the germ-free mice reconstituted with cecal contents

290

(fig. S5A). In contrast, quantification of total fungal burden indicated that the difference in

291

fungal load within the microbiota of lab versus rewilded mice was not maintained in the progeny

292

of reconstituted mice (Fig. 6C). Therefore, it is possible that sustained exposure to a high fungal

293

burden is necessary to recreate the full effect of rewilding.

294

Intestinal colonization by commensal fungi (the gut mycobiota) can contribute to

295

mammalian immunity and represents an understudied component of the microbiota (Chiaro et

296

al., 2017; Iliev et al., 2012; Jiang et al., 2017; Leonardi et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018; Limon et al.,

2019; Tso et al., 2018; Wheeler et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016). To circumvent the technical

298

difficulties with establishing prolonged fungal colonization in lab mice, we used an established

299

model in which C. albicans is introduced into antibiotics-treated mice (fig. S5B). C. albicans

300

was an attractive model to initially test our hypothesis because we demonstrated that MLNs from

301

rewilded mice are hyper-reactive to this fungus (Fig. 3). We found that antibiotics-treated mice

302

inoculated with C. albicans displayed a substantial increase in granulocytes and neutrophils

303

compared with similarly treated mice receiving a control inoculum (Fig. 5D). In addition,

304

increases in differentiated CD8+ T cell populations were observed in C. albicans colonized mice

305

(fig. S5C). These immune cell composition changes were not due to systemic infection as C.

306

albicans colonization was restricted to the gut in this model (Fig. 5E). Inoculation of germ-free

307

mice with C. albicans also reproduced the increase in granulocytes demonstrating that fungal

308

colonization is sufficient, though this approach led to a lower amount of C. albicans colonization,

309

and a corresponding less dramatic change in granulocyte numbers (Fig. 5F and fig. S5D). To

310

further demonstrate that fungal burden directly influences granulocyte numbers, we treated C.

311

albicans mono-associated mice with the antifungal drug fluconazole. Our results show that

312

pharmacologically decreasing fungal burden rapidly leads to a further decrease in granulocytes

313

(Fig. 5F and fig. S5E), indicating that the degree of intestinal colonization by fungi impacts the

314

proportion of immune cells in the periphery.

315
316

Fungi isolated from rewilded mice induce granulocyte expansion in lab mice

317

C. albicans represents a useful model and is relevant to human disease, but it is unclear

318

whether it is representative of fungi acquired in the outdoor enclosure. Having determined that

319

exposure to the natural environment leads to a large increase in fungal burden, we wished to

320

compare the precise composition of the fungal microbiota of rewilded and lab mice. Fungal

321

sequences represent a minor proportion of shotgun sequencing reads due to the dominant

322

presence of bacteria. Therefore, we performed ITS sequencing of stool to increase our resolution

323

of fungal taxa. We found that the fungal microbiota of rewilded and lab mice segregated by PCA

324

(Fig. 7A and fig. S6A). In contrast to the bacterial microbiota, we found that rewilding was

325

associated with an increase in α-diversity of fungi detected (Fig. 7B). We observed increases in

326

several fungal taxa, most notably an enrichment in Aspergillus species (Fig. 7C-D). Therefore,

327

exposure to the natural environment leads to the acquisition of an altered and expanded fungal

328

microbiota.

329

Finally, we examined whether fungi acquired in the outdoor enclosure are capable of

330

driving changes to granulocyte numbers that we observed in rewilded mice. We were able to

331

isolate many of the fungi corresponding to the taxa identified in the ITS sequencing reads when

332

we plated stool from rewilded mice on Sabouraud dextrose agar (Fig. 7E), but were unable to

333

grow any fungi from lab mice. We gavaged SPF mice every other day repeatedly for 2 weeks

334

(fig. S6B) with a consortium of representative “wild” fungi consisting of Aspergillus candidus,

335

Aspergillus proliferans, Chaetomium globosum and Dichotomopilus Indicus (corresponding to

336

plates (i)–(vii) depicted in Fig. 7E). We found that these wild fungi were able to induce the

337

increase in peripheral granulocytes and neutrophils (Fig. 7F). To test whether these fungi were

338

sufficient, we inoculated germ-free mice with the same consortium and found a similar increase

339

in granulocytes and neutrophils (Fig. 7G). Together, these experiments show that fungi in the

340

natural environment can contribute to the state of the immune system.

341
342

DISCUSSION

343

Recent studies have shown that infection with disease-causing pathogens that are

344

excluded from SPF facilities lead to large-scale changes in immunity that can alter subsequent

345

immune responses (Abolins et al., 2017; Beura et al., 2016; Reese et al., 2016; Rosshart et al.,

346

2019). Exposure to these pathogens have been suggested to ‘correct’ the immune system by

347

increasing the number of mature immune cells to more closely resemble the state of the adult

348

human immune system (Masopust et al., 2017; Tao and Reese, 2017). These fundamentally

349

important findings suggest that childhood infections that occur in most individuals contribute to

350

the education and function of our immune system. However, the extent to which commensal or

351

environmentally-acquired agents are capable of driving these changes in immunity was unclear.

352

We found that releasing laboratory mice into a natural environment, even for a limited

353

amount of time, can reproduce the enhanced differentiation of memory T cells previously

354

attributed to infection by life-threatening pathogens (Beura et al., 2016). ~25% of lab mice co-

355

housed with pet store mice did not survive the procedure (Beura et al., 2016), whereas 90% of

356

mice released into our outdoor enclosure were recovered at the end of the 6-7 week period, with

357

several of the stragglers successfully trapped thereafter (all together, >95% recovery).

358

Comprehensive serology indicated that rewilded mice were not infected by the pathogens

359

detected in pet store mice, although we acknowledge the possibility that agents not covered by

360

the assay may be present, and that our rewilded mice were likely exposed to pathobionts that can

361

cause disease in immunocompromised mice. Consistent with the minimal infection by disease-

362

causing pathogens, visual inspection and handling of rewilded WT mice indicated that they were

363

healthy and their movements were sharper and their muscles stronger than lab control mice. Thus,

364

our outdoor enclosure system may be useful for identifying immunomodulatory microbes that

365

are difficult to isolate from wild or pet shop mice that have a more complex infectious history.

366

We suggest that controlled release into nature can complement other approaches that expose

367

mice to the natural environment, and that each method has its strengths and weaknesses.

368

The most striking effect of rewilding that we identified was the expansion of

369

granulocytes in the blood including neutrophils. This finding is notable because granulocytes are

370

abundant in human blood and scarce in laboratory mice. Hence, we were eager to identify the

371

environmental variables that drive granulocyte expansion. The microbiota of rewilded mice was

372

characterized by a significant increase in total fungi that included acquisition of Aspergillus

373

species. Transfer of microbiota from rewilded mice into germ-free mice was able to reproduce

374

the increase in granulocytes. Still, the proportion of blood granulocytes in reconstituted germ-

375

free mice was lower than that of rewilded mice, potentially due to the poor engraftment of fungi.

376

Therefore, we examined the contribution of fungi directly and found that granulocytes expansion

377

could be recreated through inoculation of lab mice with a model human commensal fungus, C.

378

albicans, or a cocktail of fungi isolated from rewilded mice. Our observation that the degree of

379

fungal burden recovered in stool correlates with neutrophil numbers provides additional evidence

380

that fungi contribute to the proportion of granulocytes in the blood. Intestinal colonization by C.

381

albicans occurs in the majority of adult humans and is associated with enhanced Th17 CD4+ T

382

cell differentiation, and IL-17 produced by these T cells can explain the increase in neutrophils

383

(Bacher et al., 2019; Shao et al., 2019). It is possible that the normalization of the immune

384

system that occurs upon rewilding, at least with respect to granulocytes, mimics intestinal

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/742387; this version posted December 9, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

385

colonization by C. albicans in humans. We suggest that restoring the fungal microbiota of lab

386

mice can make the murine model a better match to human physiology.

387

We also had an opportunity to determine the contribution of two IBD susceptibility genes.

388

Neither Atg16l1 nor Nod2 mutation had a noticeable effect on the leukocyte populations we

389

measured. Interestingly, Atg16l1 mutant mice that served as the lab controls displayed a large

390

increase in fungal burden. Although unclear if related, a subset of the rewilded Atg16l1 mutant

391

mice displayed diarrhea. We previously demonstrated that Atg16l1 and Nod2 mutant mice

392

develop small intestinal defects in a manner dependent on specific commensal-like agents, and

393

that close relatives of these agents do not trigger any abnormalities (Cadwell et al., 2010;

394

Kernbauer et al., 2014a; Matsuzawa-Ishimoto et al., 2017; Ramanan et al., 2016; Ramanan et al.,

395

2014). The observation that most of the Atg16l1 and Nod2 mutant mice did not display obvious

396

signs of intestinal inflammation may reflect this specificity of gene-microbe interactions in IBD.

397

As we only included two genotypes and on one background (C57BL/6J) in this study, a more

398

comprehensive examination of genetic susceptibility to a change in environment is warranted.

399

In conclusion, our results indicate that fungi are among the different infectious entities

400

that mammals encounter in the natural environment and represent one of the missing or altered

401

components of the microbiota in lab mice kept under SPF conditions. Microbes, vegetation, and

402

climate vary across the globe, and it is likely that exposure to nature has a different consequence

403

depending on the location. Nevertheless, the recent study characterizing wildings noted that wild

404

mice when compared with lab mice indeed display increased colonization by Ascomycota, the

405

phylum that includes the Aspergillus species we found in our rewilded mice (Rosshart et al.,

406

2019). Therefore, exposure to fungi may not be unique to our experimental system, and it

407

remains possible that this fungal exposure drives the altered immunity observed in other studies

408

examining wild or pet shop mice. When taken together, the findings we present here expand our

409

understanding of the immunomodulatory role of intestinal fungi and indicate that a diverse

410

fungal microbiota, likely together with the bacterial microbiota, participates in the differentiation

411

of the immune system in a free-living mammal.
