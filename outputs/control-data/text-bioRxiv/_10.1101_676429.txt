ABSTRACT

14 Tinnitus mechanisms remain poorly understood. Our previous functional MRI (fMRI) studies
15 demonstrated an abnormal hyperactivity in the right parietal operculum 3 (OP3) in acoustic
16 trauma tinnitus and during provoked phantom sound perceptions without hearing loss, which
17 lead us to propose a new model of tinnitus. This new model is not directly linked with
18 hearing loss and primary auditory cortex abnormalities, but with a proprioceptive disturbance
19 related to middle-ear muscles. In the present study, a seed-based resting-state functional MRI
20 method was used to explore the potential abnormal connectivity of this opercular region
21 between an acoustic trauma tinnitus group presenting slight to mild tinnitus and a control
22 group. Primary auditory cortex seeds were also explored because they were thought to be
23 directly involved in tinnitus in most current models. In such a model, hearing loss and
24 tinnitus handicap were confounding factors and were therefore regressed in our analysis.
25 Between-groups comparisons showed a significant specific connectivity between the right
26 OP3 seeds and the potential human homologue of the premotor ear-eye field (H-PEEF)
27 bilaterally and the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) in the tinnitus group. Our findings suggest the
28 existence of a simultaneous premotor ear-eye disturbance in tinnitus that could lift the veil on
29 unexplained subclinical abnormalities in oculomotor tests found in tinnitus patients with
30 normal vestibular responses. The present work confirms the involvement of the OP3
31 subregion in acoustic trauma tinnitus and provides some new clues to explain its putative
32 mechanisms.

INTRODUCTION

62

Tinnitus (i.e, ringing or whistling in the ears) is a symptom that emerges with a variety of

63

diseases (Bagueley et al., 2013), leading to the definition of several types of tinnitus. Among

64

the different types of tinnitus, acoustic trauma tinnitus was thought to be the direct result of

65

cochlear injury and deafferentations inducing maladaptive changes in the central nervous

66

system. However, this generally accepted model did not fit various situations (e.g. some

67

people have hearing loss without tinnitus and vice versa) and moreover treatments based on

68

this model to abolish tinnitus in humans have proved unsuccessful (Lehner et al., 2016;

69

Vanneste et al., 2013; Elgoyhen et al., 2015). Contrarily to the current acoustic trauma tinnitus

70

model, we showed in our previous fMRI studies that tinnitus may not come from hearing loss

71

itself, but from a somatosensory disturbance, most probably involving middle ear muscle

72

proprioceptive disturbance (Job et al., 2011; Job et al. 2016), leading to erroneous integration

73

of proprioceptive signals (i.e, illusory sound) in the brain. Indeed, our previous study aimed at

74

stimulating the middle ear proprioceptors by applying specific click vibration rates to the ear

75

(Job et al. 2016), which resulted in a tinnitus-like perception in healthy subjects at a particular

76

frequency. The neural correlates of this stimulation were found in a small brain region in the

77

right operculum 3 (OP3) (Job et al., 2016). This region was also hyperactivated in the fMRI

78

study comparing sound detection in a tinnitus group and a control group (Job et al., 2012). In

79

many tinnitus studies it may have been overlooked, because MRI spatial smoothing may mask

80

it by merging it with the primary auditory cortex.

81

It has been shown that disturbed muscle proprioceptive inputs using mechanical vibration

82

send erroneous messages to the brain as a form of illusory perception (Roll et al., 2004;

83

Kavounoudias et al., 2008). Similarly, illusory auditory perceptions could occur in the

84

auditory system as long as such proprioceptors are present in the middle-ear muscles, a result

85

that was demonstrated by Kierner (Kierner et al., 1999). In acoustic trauma, the physical

86

stress generated in the whole auditory system, including the middle ear, is extreme (Job et al,

87

2016; Wojtczak et al, 2017) and could overwhelm physiologic adaptations.

88

In order to further investigate the existence of a specific network related to tinnitus percept,

89

we hereby explore the connectivity of this OP3 region in acoustic trauma tinnitus, using a

90

seed-based connectivity approach with resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging

91

(rs-fMRI). Seed-based rs-fMRI provides a close view of specific functional connectivity from

92

brain regions of interest (ROIs). It also allows for adjustment of the data to confounding

93

factors. Here, in this context, hearing loss may be a confounding physiological factor and

94

psychological disturbance related to tinnitus may be a second confounding factor. If our

95

hypothesis is valid, specific connectivity related to the percept of tinnitus per se should be

96

observed despite these factors.

97

Possible differential connectivity between the tinnitus group and the control group was

98

investigated from the right OP3 tinnitus-related seed (Job et al, 2016) and from its nearest

99

regions, the anterior and posterior regions situated in the cytoarchitectonically defined right

100

OP3 using same-shaped boxes. The left OP3 seed, mirror of the right OP3 seed, was also

101

investigated for connectivity to check for laterality. Lastly, we explored connectivity from

102

primary auditory cortex ROIs (Heschl’s gyri) since the current acoustic trauma tinnitus model

103

involves these areas.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

105

Participants

106

Nineteen chronic tinnitus male participants (mean age 42. 5 ± 12 years old) with acoustic

107

trauma sequelae ≥ 6 months (mean duration 11.9 ± 9.6 years, median = 12 years) and nineteen

108

male controls matched in age without tinnitus (mean age 42. 5 ± 11. 9 years) were included in

109

the study. All tinnitus participants were recruited through medical unit physicians in military

110

regiments, through general announcements in the regiments and through the Ear, Nose and

111

Throat (ENT) department of military hospitals open to civilians. The age-matched and

112

gender-matched controls without tinnitus were recruited through announcement on a

113

specialised website for call of volunteers for scientific protocols and by word-of-mouth.

114

Control participants should not have reported frequent or permanent tinnitus, but could have

115

experienced once or occasionally tinnitus in their ears.

116

The study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee CPP Sud-est V, Ref: 10-CRSS-05

117

MS 14-52, and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed written

118

consent was obtained from all participants.

119

Hearing levels (HL), tinnitus description and Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI)

120

Both tinnitus participants and matched controls underwent audiograms. We assessed hearing

121

performances by tonal audiometry at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 kHz (Audioscan fx by Essilor©) the

122

day of the MRI acquisitions. Electroacoustic calibration of the audiometer equipped with

123

Beyer dynamics DT48 earphones, was performed in accordance with AFNOR French

124

standard S3007. We used the automated Hughson-Westlake procedure, which consisted in

125

assessing hearing thresholds by modifying sound intensity using 5 dB up and 10 dB down

126

steps. Sound intensity levels were modified automatically according to the participant’s

127

responses. Threshold was defined as the lowest level at which at least two responses out of

128

three presentations were obtained on an ascending run. Hearing losses were expressed in dB

129

HL.

130

Two tinnitus questionnaires were completed by tinnitus participants. The first was an

131

interview form collecting general information about the participant’s tinnitus. The second

132

questionnaire was the tinnitus handicap inventory (THI) questionnaire, used internationally to

133

robustly assess the intensity/intrusiveness of tinnitus and its associated handicap (Newman et

134

al., 1996). THI scores are divided into severity grades (i.e., slight (THI 0-16), mild (THI 18-

135

36), moderate (THI 38-56), severe (THI 58-76), catastrophic (78-100) (McCombe et al.,

136

2001). According to this grading, the participants’ tinnitus characteristics were slight to

137

moderate (Table 1).

138

MRI data acquisition

139

A resting state-fMRI study was performed to search for a potential functional network

140

specific to the tinnitus perception per se. For the rs-fMRI sequence, participants were

141

instructed to lie quietly supine inside the scanner with their eyes open and to let their mind

142

wanderi without focusing their thoughts on anything in particular. During acquisition, a grey

143

background image with a small white cross in the centre was displayed. The MRI scanning

144

sessions were conducted on a 3T Philips Achieva-TX scanner (Best, The Netherlands) at the

145

Grenoble MRI facility-IRMaGe, equipped with a 32 channel-head coil. The examination

146

protocol included a long rs-fMRI data sequence (longer than current sequence used in tinnitus

147

research investigations) and a structural high resolution T1 weighted image. The parameters

148

of the gradient echo EPI sequence were adjusted in order to lower the scanner noise to limit

149

the acoustic dose received by participants. This was achieved by lowering the slope of the

150

commutation gradients (i.e., SoftTone=yes). The frequency spectrum of the acquisition

151

sequence presents a peak at a lower frequency (630 Hz) and with a 10 dB reduction as

152

compared with the standard sequence. The high frequencies, above or equal to 1kHz, present

153

an average reduction of 13 dB, when compared to the standard sequence used in fMRI on this

154

MR scanner (Fig. 1). This sequence was reported as acoustically comfortable by participants.

155

Other main parameters were: 32 slices, 3.5 mm-thick, acquired with a multiband factor of 2,

156

in plane voxel size = 3x3 mm2, TR = 2000 ms, TE = 32 ms, flip angle = 75°, SENSE factor =

157

3, 5 dummy volumes and 400 volumes. This long acquisition duration (13'20'') was chosen

158

since it is directly related to the reliability of rs-fMRI connectivity estimates (Birn et al., 2013;

159

Termenon et al., 2016). This voxel size was chosen since it ensures a higher functional

160

connectivity as compared to smaller size (Molloy et al, 2013). Choice of TR=2s avoids

161

contamination of the useful part of the signal (below 0.1 Hz) by participant’s respiration. The

162

examination ends with a T1-weighted structural image acquisition for each participant (3D

163

MPRAGE, 0.9x0.9x1.2 mm3, TI = 800 ms, TR = 25 ms, TE = 3.9 ms, flip = 15°, SENSE

164

factor = 2.2).

165

MRI data preprocessing

166

As the seed of interest in right OP3 is highly accurately located within the brain, we

167

performed the analysis pipeline to preserve the spatial accuracy. We preprocessed the fMRI

168

data using SPM12 software (www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/). Pre-processing of

169

fMRI data included motion correction, slice-timing and co-registration of functional images

170

on the individual structural image. No spatial smoothing was applied so as to avoid blurring

171

of functional images. We further realigned all individual anatomical and functional images to

172

a common referential using the DARTEL elastic registration algorithm (Ashburner, 2007) that

173

allows accurate inter-individual brain realignment. To do this, we first performed

174

segmentation of each structural image to extract the grey matter (GM), white matter (WM)

175

and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) images. We then calculated the deformation field that

176

transforms the individual GM images to a high accurate GM template compatible with the

177

standard MNI coordinates system. We chose the template provided with the Computational

178

Anatomy Toolbox for SPM because it is spatially very accurate (http://dbm.neuro.uni-jena.de/

179

cat). The deformation field image of each participant was further applied to the structural GM,

180

WM, CSF images and to the functional individual images. All the individual images were

181

then in the same template space with the same spatial resolution (isotropic 1.5 mm) for further

182

accurate analysis. The mean structural image among participants was eventually computed for

183

display purposes so that our results precisely matched the anatomy.

184

Seed regions

185

We first included the tinnitus-related region of interest in right OP3, derived from our

186

previous work (Job et al, 2016). This ROI and its spatial equivalent on the left hemisphere (as

187

control) were boxes (9x4x4 mm3) built with Marsbar (http://marsbar.sourceforge.net),

188

centered at MNI: ± 40 -13 17, corresponding to the location previously found. For an

189

extensive exploration of right OP3, we created just anterior and posterior to the ROI, an

190

anterior box centered at MNI: ± 40 -9 17 and a posterior box centered at MNI: ± 42 -17 17

191

(Fig. 2).

192

In order to further address the connectivity of the primary auditory areas that is said to be

193

involved in tinnitus perception, two other seed regions were chosen in the right and left

194

primary auditory cortices. These seeds were defined as the whole Heschl’s gyri by combining

195

the

198

Functional seed-based connectivity analysis: individual level

199

We conducted seed-based connectivity analyses using the CONN toolbox (Whitfield-Gabrieli

200

et al, 2012) (www.nitrc.org/projects/conn) version 18.a. For each individual, we first detected

201

possible outliers in functional series derived from the art toolbox and then we removed

202

physiological and other noise sources using the component-based noise correction method

203

CompCor (Behzadi et al., 2007) that regresses signals from WM and CSF. The other

204

components regressed are the six realignment parameters and their first-order temporal

205

derivatives and outliers. No global signal regression is performed since its removal can affect

206

correlation patterns and distort group differences (Saad et al., 2012). Prior to denoising, since

207

the functional images were not spatially smoothed, the histogram was only weakly shifted

208

towards the positive values. After this denoising step, the voxel-to-voxel correlation

209

histogram was centred at about 0 with a standard deviation of about 0.12 for 107 degrees of

210

freedom, which is a criterion of good data quality. This was visually checked for each

211

participant’s data. Finally, bandpass filtering was applied within 0.008 to 0.08 Hz to all time-

212

series, to select the data matching the resting-state frequency band. For each participant and

213

each seed, Pearson’s correlation between time-series was computed voxel-wise, providing a

214

correlation map that was eventually converted to z-map using Fisher’s r-to-z transform for

215

further group analysis.

216

Functional seed-based connectivity analysis: group level

217

Within- and between-group analyses from the control and the tinnitus groups were conducted

218

for each seed separately. For the tinnitus group, the statistical tests were performed while

219

regressing out potential confounds related to hearing loss and handicap related to tinnitus, by

220

inserting the corresponding regressors of no interest (HL, THI). For within-group analysis,

221

whole brain false discovery rate, FDR-corrected threshold of p<0.05 was retained for

222

statistical significance. For between-group comparisons, to assess specific connectivity related

223

to the tinnitus percept, a two sample t-test was performed. We analysed differential

224

connectivity between the groups in the contrasts, tinnitus > controls and tinnitus < controls,

225

from the different seeds to the entire brain. We chose a robust statistical threshold (p<0.0001,

226

cluster-size p-FDR corrected < 0.05) to elicit significant differential connectivity.

227

RESULTS

228

Participants’ characteristics

229

In tinnitus participants, the mean hearing threshold was significantly different from that of

230

the control group, for frequencies ranging from 1 kHz to 8 kHz (Mann-Whitney test, p<0.05),

231

with marked hearing loss at frequencies superior to 4 kHz (Mann-Whitney test, p<0.001), as

232

usually observed with acoustic traumas (Fig. 3). At the frequency of the peak of noise in the

233

acquisition sequence, no differences in hearing were found between the two groups, thus

234

ruling out the possibility that differential connectivity could arise from differences in acoustic

235

perception related to scanner noise. All tinnitus participants described their tinnitus as high-

236

pitched whistling except for one who described a medium high-pitched sizzling. The loudness

237

was scored on an analogic visual scale (mean 4.5 ± sd 1.6 ranging from 2 to 8, from a total

238

possible range 0-10). Bilateral tinnitus represented 68% of our population. There was a same

239

amount of right and left tinnitus. Tinnitus duration ranged from 6 months to 25 years (mean

240

12.2 ± 7.3 years).

241

Tinnitus Handicap Inventory scores described a slight to mild tinnitus in all participants

242

(mean 16.2 ± 10.5) except for one with moderate tinnitus (THI=44), reflecting a tinnitus

243

population less impacted than in the current literature in the field.

244

Detailed results from audiometry and neuropsychological testing are presented in Table 1 for

245

tinnitus participants.

246

Functional connectivity with OP3 seeds

247

Within-group connectivity of the right OP3 box in controls and tinnitus (Fig. 4A) revealed a

248

main connectivity with the sensorimotor network (bilateral precentral gyri, bilateral

249

postcentral gyri, bilateral central and parietal opercular cortices, supplementary motor area),

250

but also with the salience network (bilateral insular cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus) and the

251

auditory network (bilateral Heschl’s gyri, bilateral planum temporale, bilateral planum

252

polare). Within-group connectivity of the contralateral left OP3 box in controls and tinnitus

253

(Fig. 4B) provided a similar pattern as that of the right OP3 box, reflecting a symmetric

254

pattern of connectivity. Note that for sake of visibility, the display threshold was lowered in

255

the tinnitus group to make them visually comparable.

256

Between-group comparison revealed a specific connectivity in the tinnitus group as compared

257

to controls with the right OP3 seed. This specific connectivity was found with a region in the

258

right superior frontal gyrus at the border of BA6 and 8 (Fig. 5A), with a maximum at MNI

259

coordinates (20, 11, 47) (Table 2). We could not elicit any differential connectivity from the

260

homologous left hemisphere OP3 box, even at a lower threshold. No significant reduced

261

connectivity was found in tinnitus group as compared to the control group.

262

The anterior and posterior seeds in the right OP3 gave different between-group differential

263

connectivity results. The anterior seed did not show any significant differential connectivity.

264

In contrast, with the posterior right OP3 seed, we found a specific connectivity with the

265

contralateral left H-PEEF and with the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL) in a part that could

266

correspond to hIP2 or to PFt (Caspers et al, 2008), according to the Anatomy toolbox (Fig.

267

5B, Table 2).

268

Functional connectivity with auditory seeds

269

Within-group connectivity with Heschl’s gyri showed bilateral connectivity with auditory

270

regions, operculum, insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the face representation of the

271

sensorimotor cortex (Fig. 6).

272

Between-group connectivity with Heschl’s gyri seeds elicited a single significant differential

273

connectivity between left Heschl’s gyrus and the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex. No other

differential connectivity was found at the same statistical threshold than for the right OP3

seed, when adjusting for the hearing loss and for the handicap related to tinnitus.

DISCUSSION

277

The tinnitus participants that were recruited in this study were different from those usually

278

recruited. Indeed, in most studies, tinnitus subjects are recruited from ENT services and are

279

strongly impacted psychologically by their tinnitus. The results found in the literature are thus

280

related not only to tinnitus percept but also to psychological and quality of life factors and it is

281

therefore difficult to disentangle these factors. On the contrary, in the present study, the

282

tinnitus participants were not strongly affected by their tinnitus: it did not impact their quality

283

of life even if they presented hearing loss at high frequencies and a slight handicap, as

284

assessed by the THI score. In addition, the analyses that were performed here took these

285

factors into account to regress their impact. Altogether, we thus believe that the results

286

presented here mainly related to the tinnitus percept per se.

287

When considering the seed of interest, the right OP3 box derived from previous studies (Job

288

et al. 2012, Job et al. 2016a), within-group connectivity was found to involve

289

somatosensory and the saliency as well as the auditory networks. This suggests that our seed

290

may play a pivotal role in the integration of somatosensory and auditory informations

291

presenting salient features. This result is in line with a recent functional connectivity study

292

suggesting that the parietal operculum could be a connector hub that links auditory,

293

somatosensory, and motor cortical areas (Tanaka et al., 2018). The connectivity pattern that

294

we obtained is almost similar for both our groups. Checking for significant differences

295

between them, we found a specific connectivity between the tinnitus-related right OP3 seed

296

and the right H-PEEF in the tinnitus group as compared to controls when controlling for the

297

differences in hearing loss and in psychological factors associated with tinnitus, suggesting its

298

relation with the tinnitus percept per se. In macaque monkeys, this is the region of the

299

premotor ear-eye field (PEEF) (Lanzilotto et al., 2013), a region that is thought to play an

300

important role in engaging the auditory spatial attention for the purpose of orienting eye and

301

ear towards the sound source. The region found here, posterior to the frontal eye field is

302

probably the human homologue of the PEEF, so an H-PEEF. In macaques, the “premotor ear-

303

eye field” region (PEEF) (Hutchison et al., 2012 ; Lanzilotto et al., 2013 ; Lucchetti et al.,

304

2008) involves auditory-motor cells for both eye and ear movements. The human homologue

305

to the macaque PEEF (H-PEEF), for which the connectivity with right OP3 is disturbed in

306

participants with tinnitus is a new finding. It is possible, although speculative, that as in

307

macaques, the H-PEEF might play a premotor role in the control of coordinated ocular

308

movements and tympano-middle-ear movements, pinna movements being vestigial in human.

309

In the right posterior seed, increased connectivity was observed with the Left H-PEEF. Thus,

310

the oculomotor muscles’ proprioceptive system responsible of eyes coordination (Donaldson,

311

2000) would be disturbed by its potential coupling with an altered middle-ear system.

312

Interestingly, our results could shed light on unexplained observations of poor binocular

313

coordination in subjects with tinnitus. Oculomotor performance during saccades (Lang et al.,

314

2013), fixation, smooth pursuit, optokinetic nystagmus movements and vergence were

315

reduced in tinnitus participants (Josefowicz-Korczynska et al., 2002; Mezzalira et al., 2007;

316

Kapoula et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2010; Lockwood et al., 2001), however signs of vestibular

317

dysfunction were absent. In addition, the literature reports some tinnitus subjects that are able

318

to modulate their tinnitus with eye movements (Coad et al., 2001). These lower performances

319

do not seem to be related to the severity of the handicap because they do not correlate with

320

neuropsychological tests measuring the emotional/attentional status (Josefowicz-Korczynska

321

et al., 2002).

322

Here we demonstrate that the subregion in the right OP3, already shown to be related to

323

tinnitus (Job et al., 2012 ; Job et al., 2016), is once again a site of dysfunction in these tinnitus

324

participants. The dysfunction seems focal, because when we further tested a larger seed

325

involving the whole cytoarchitectonic right OP3, we did not elicit any abnormal connectivity

326

from it.

327

In addition, in the right posterior seed, increased connectivity was observed with the inferior

328

parietal lobule. The inferior parietal lobule is a vast region participating in the integration of

329

sensory information. For instance, the left inferior parietal lobule is involved in proprioceptive

330

illusion (Naito et al., 1999; Kavounoudias et al. 2008; Naito et al. 2017), tactile illusion

331

(Kavounoudias et al. 2008) as well as auditory illusions (Brancucci et al. 2017). These new

332

findings support the view that tinnitus could be a proprioceptive illusion.

333

Concerning functional connectivity from both Heschl’s gyri, a single differential connectivity

334

was found between our two groups between left Heschl gyrus and the posterior cingulate

335

cortex at the same statistical threshold than for the other opercular seeds. No other significant

336

differential connectivity was found between our two groups, supporting the view that mild

337

tinnitus percept following acoustic trauma is not directly related to modified connectivity with

338

auditory regions. This is complementary to the results from Langers who found that

339

macroscopic tonotopic reorganization in the auditory cortex is not required for the emergence

340

of tinnitus but rather that this reorganization relates to hearing loss (Langers et al., 2012).

341

CONCLUSION

342

In conclusion, our major findings are that: i) in tinnitus participants, there is a specific

343

connectivity between a seed in the right OP3 and a human counterpart to the premotor ear-eye

344

field (H-PEEF), the expression of a crosstalk between ear and eye that may explain disturbed

345

oculomotor performance in tinnitus patients; ii) the small right OP3 seeds also more

346

connected to a region in the inferior parietal lobule in tinnitus patients is confirmed as a key

347

region for mild tinnitus percept, particularly for acoustic trauma tinnitus, being able to

348

integrate somatosensory and auditory salient features. Further investigations will be needed to

349

better understand this disturbed crosstalk between the ear and eye systems and to draw novel

350

conclusions on tinnitus mechanisms.
