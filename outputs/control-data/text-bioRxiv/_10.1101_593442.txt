Abstract

19

Oral infection of mice with Salmonella Typhimurium is an important model system. In particular

20

C57Bl/6 mice, which are susceptible to Salmonella, are used to study both systemic and

21

gastrointestinal pathogenesis. Pretreatment with streptomycin disrupts the intestinal

22

microbiota and results in colitis resembling human intestinal Salmonellosis. Oral gavage is

23

typically used for delivery of both antibiotic and bacteria. Although convenient, this method

24

requires a moderate level of expertise, can be stressful for experimental animals, and may lead

25

to unwanted tracheal or systemic introduction of bacteria. Here, we demonstrate a simple

26

method for oral infection of mice using small pieces of regular mouse chow inoculated with a

27

known number of bacteria. Mice readily ate chow pieces containing up to 108 CFU Salmonella,

28

allowing for a wide range of infectious doses. In mice pretreated with streptomycin, infection

29

with inoculated chow resulted in less variability in numbers of bacteria recovered from tissues

30

compared to oral gavage, and highly consistent infections even at doses as low as 103

31

Salmonella. Mice not treated with streptomycin, as well as resistant Nramp1 reconstituted

32

C57Bl/6J mice, were also readily infected using this method. In summary, we show that

33

foodborne infection of mice by feeding with pieces of chow inoculated with Salmonella results

34

in infection comparable to oral gavage but represents a natural route of infection with fewer

35

side effects and less variability among mice.

38

Bacteria belonging to the genus Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica are one of the most

39

common causes of self-limiting foodborne diarrheal disease in humans and other animals [1]

40

and a leading cause of death due to foodborne pathogens globally [2] and in the US [3].

41

Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (hereafter Salmonella) is one of the serovars most

42

commonly isolated from human gastrointestinal infections. Salmonella infects new hosts in a

43

fecal-to-oral manner and is often the cause of foodborne disease outbreaks when present in

44

contaminated food, such as fresh produce [4] and poultry and egg products [5]. Salmonella has

45

been thoroughly studied and is one of the best characterized human pathogens. This, combined

46

with its simple growth requirements, has led to its frequent use as a model organism for in vivo

47

studies of the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal infections.

48

The most widely used animal model for Salmonella is the mouse [6]. Strains of mice differ in

49

their susceptibility to Salmonella infection, with C57Bl/6J and BALB/c mice being highly

50

susceptible and 129/Sv strains of mice being very resistant [7-10]. Susceptibility is

51

multifactorial, but one important resistance factor is the Nramp1 protein encoded by the

52

Slc11a1 gene [11]. Nramp1 is an ion transporter responsible for the transport of divalent

53

cations out of phagosomes, thus limiting the availability of iron and other ions for ingested

54

microbes and impairing their growth in phagocytes [12]. Many susceptible mouse strains,

55

including C57Bl/6J, harbor a point mutation in the Slc11a1 gene resulting in a non-functional

56

Nramp1 protein [13, 14]. Oral infection of susceptible mouse strains eventually leads to a lethal

57

systemic infection but without diarrhea and only diffuse enteritis [15]. However, following

58

disruption of the intestinal microbiota by antibiotic treatment, mice develop intestinal

59

inflammation more similar to human intestinal Salmonellosis, although Salmonella do still go

60

systemic [16, 17].

61

In the preferred murine model of oral Salmonella infection, C57Bl/6 mice are treated with

62

antibiotics and infected by oral gavage using blunt end gavage needles. This method of delivery

63

is intragastric rather than oral, since substances are delivered directly into the stomach. While

64

the use of gavage needles allows for the delivery of precise amounts of inoculum and timing of

65

delivery, there are several drawbacks to their use, which have been recognized mostly in

66

toxicological studies [18]. Performing oral gavage requires a moderate degree of technical

67

expertise and can induce stress, e.g. raising corticosteroid levels in the blood or increasing

68

blood pressure, which may affect study outcome [19-21]. Furthermore, mice may regurgitate

69

delivered substances or infectious agents following gavage, resulting in tracheal or nasal

70

administration [22, 23]. Lastly, gavage may induce pharyngeal or esophageal trauma, leading to

71

the inadvertent delivery of substances or infectious agents directly into the blood stream or, in

72

rare cases, death [23, 24].

73

Improvements to oral gavage have been suggested, such as precoating needles with sucrose,

74

which improved gavage success rate and reduced stress of animals [25]. An alternative method

75

to gavage would be ingestion of food or water containing a pathogen. This would circumvent

76

many of the drawbacks with oral gavage and mimics a natural route of infection for Salmonella.

77

Recently, a paper described a method of delivering Salmonella orally in drinking water [26], and

78

a similar approach was used for the oral delivery of a Salmonella vaccine to sheep [27].

79

Inoculated food (pieces of bread) has been used for Listeria monocytogenes infections [28].

80

However, to our knowledge, food as a vehicle of delivery for Salmonella infection has not been

81

reported.

82

In this paper, we describe an oral infection method using pieces of regular mouse chow

83

inoculated with Salmonella. Preparation of inoculated chow is simple and mice readily consume

84

chow containing high numbers of bacteria. This mode of infection leads to a very consistent

85

disease progression among mice, less variability in bacterial load, in both systemic and

86

gastrointestinal tissues, and eliminates many of the possible drawbacks with oral gavage.

87

Importantly, this method represents a natural route of infection with Salmonella.

Results and Discussion

90

Salmonella remains viable on mouse chow

91

We hypothesized that regular mouse chow could be used to inoculate mice with Salmonella to

92

establish a simple, stress-free and natural route of Salmonella infection. At our facility, mice

93

typically receive 2016 Teklad Global 16% Protein Rodent Diet (Envigo, Madison, Wisconsin

94

USA), chow commonly used by research institutions (see e.g. [29]). To confirm that Salmonella

95

does not lose viability on chow, pieces of chow (approximately 5 mm in diameter) were

96

prepared from pellets (Fig 1A) and inoculated with known numbers of bacteria. Following

97

incubation at room temperature for 1 or 3 h, the chow pieces were homogenized, diluted and

98

plated to enumerate colony forming units (CFUs). As a comparison, bacteria were also diluted

99

and inoculated in sterile pharmaceutical grade saline (SPGS). Salmonella showed no decrease in

numbers of bacteria.

107

Delivery of Salmonella using chow results in infection similar to

108

gavage delivery and has less variability

109

Gavage is the method traditionally used to deliver Salmonella in oral infection of mice and for

110

streptomycin treatment. To investigate how oral infection with chow compared to the

111

commonly used procedure for infection by gavage, streptomycin treated (hereafter referred to

112

as strep+) C57Bl/6J mice were infected with 104 CFU Salmonella using either method (Fig 2A).

113

For oral gavage, mice were gavaged with streptomycin (20 mg) 24 h prior to being gavaged with

114

Salmonella diluted in SPGS (100 µl). Mice were fasted for 4 h prior to each gavage. For mice

115

infected with chow, to avoid gavage altogether, streptomycin was added to the drinking water

116

(final dilution of 5 mg/ml) for 24 h [30]. C57Bl/6J mice drink approximately 6 ml of water per 24

117

h [31], which results in an approximate total dose of 30 mg streptomycin. After 24 h normal

118

drinking water was returned, mice were fasted for approximately 20 h, then fed pieces of chow

119

inoculated with Salmonella diluted in SPGS. Since we were concerned that high levels of

120

Salmonella might affect the palatability of chow, we initially used a low inoculum of Salmonella,

121

although the dose most frequently used is approximately 108 Salmonella [16, 29, 32]. Mice

122

readily ate chow pieces inoculated with approximately 104 CFU. At 3 days post infection (p.i.),

123

mice displayed very mild, if any, clinical signs of disease, although feces was frequently found

124

on the walls of the cage, indicating wet stool. Despite the low inoculum, all mice were infected

125

although those infected with inoculated chow had higher bacterial loads in tissues, especially in

126

the intestines, compared to those infected by gavage (Fig 2B). While this could be a result of

127

the inoculation method itself, it could also be due to either the prolonged streptomycin

128

treatment in the drinking water or the prolonged fasting period [33, 34]. Bacterial numbers

129

were more consistent between the mice in the chow infection group when compared to mice in

130

the gavage group. This consistency was most notable in the feces, where bacterial numbers in

131

gavaged mice ranged from 0 (below the limit of detection) to 3.4108 and in chow infected

132

mice from 1.6108 to 1.31010. The variability in infection due to oral gavage has been

133

observed previously [26]. Since oral gavage may induce regurgitation and subsequent

134

unintended tracheal delivery of substances [22] we also examined the lungs for Salmonella.

135

Mice infected by either method contained low levels of Salmonella in the lungs, again with

136

more variability in mice infected with gavage (0 to 8.7103) compared to those infected via

137

chow (8.9101 to 5.4102) (Fig 2B). The presence of bacteria in the lungs is not overly surprising

138

considering the susceptibility of strep+ C57Bl/6J mice to disseminated Salmonella infection,

139

however, two mice infected by oral gavage contained considerably (>1 log) higher bacterial

140

numbers in the lungs than the rest of the mice. This may indicate unintended tracheal

141

administration of Salmonella as a complication of the gavage process. Altogether, these

142

findings indicate that infection with inoculated chow results in more consistent disease with

143

less complications compared to the traditional gavage method.

Mice readily eat chow pieces inoculated with high loads of Salmonella

149

and show consistent infection

150

Having shown that chow inoculated with a low dose (104 CFU) of Salmonella results in

151

consistent infection we next compared a dose range. Pieces of chow were inoculated with 103

152

to 106 CFU and fed to strep+ C57Bl/6J mice. For doses of 105 bacteria and higher, the bacteria

153

were pelleted by centrifugation and then diluted in SPGS (washed) before dilution since mice

154

were hesitant to eat chow inoculated with these high doses if they were not washed (data not

155

shown). This may be due to the intrinsic smell or taste of the growth medium or the presence

156

of high amounts of bacterial products. After introducing the wash step, mice readily ate chow

157

pieces containing up to 108 CFU. By 3 days p.i. all mice had developed systemic infection even

158

at the lowest dose (103) and bacterial loads were strikingly similar (Fig 3A), indicating no dose

159

dependence for the development of disseminated systemic disease, correlating with previous

160

reports [30]. Bacterial loads were consistent in systemic tissues but showed more variability in

161

gastrointestinal tissues with the greatest variability seen in the ileum (3.0105 to 5108 CFU/g).

162

Bacterial loads were highest in the cecum (approximately 109 CFU/g) and lowest in the blood

163

(approximately 102 CFU/ml). To investigate if chow infection works in a resistant mouse strain,

164

we used C57Bl/6J mice reconstituted with a functional Nramp1 (hereafter referred to as

165

Nramp1+/+) [11, 13, 14]. Mice with a functional Nramp1 protein are more resistant to oral

166

Salmonella infection both with and without prior streptomycin treatment [8, 17]. For the

167

Nramp1+/+ mice we tested doses of 104 and 105 bacteria. A dose of 104 resulted in inconsistent

168

infection in systemic tissues, while 105 resulted in a consistent systemic infection, indicating

169

that 105 is the minimum dose required for 100% systemic infection. As expected, Nramp1+/+

170

mice were substantially more resistant to infection, compared to C57Bl/6J mice, with lower

171

bacterial loads in all tissues but particularly in systemic organs (Fig 3B). Nonetheless, bacterial

172

loads in Nramp1+/+ mice followed the same trends as in C57Bl/6J mice with the highest number

173

of bacteria in the feces followed by the cecum, ileum, spleen, liver and blood. Interestingly,

174

bacterial loads were also lower in the feces of Nramp1+/+ mice, indicating that functional

175

Nramp1 is important for limiting bacterial numbers in intestinal luminal contents as well as

176

systemically.

Next we infected non-streptomycin treated (hereafter referred to as strep-) C57Bl/6J and

infection, we used a dose of 108 bacteria, the standard dose used in oral infections of mice with

185

Salmonella (see e.g. [16, 32, 35]). After washing the bacteria, mice readily ate pieces of chow

186

containing this high inoculum. C57Bl/6J mice had consistent bacterial loads in intestinal tissues,

187

while Nramp1+/+ mice showed more variability in loads which were also sometimes below the

188

level of detection (Fig 4). In systemic tissues, no bacteria were detected in any of the Nramp1+/+

189

mice and bacterial numbers were variable in C57Bl/6J mice. In the intestinal tract, the

190

differences in bacterial loads between C57Bl/6J and Nramp1+/+ mice were statistically

191

significant in the ileum and feces.

198

In summary, infections of strep+ and strep- C57Bl/6J and Nramp1+/+ mice with pieces of chow

199

inoculated with Salmonella are consistent with studies using oral gavage. While it is difficult to

200

determine the dose of nontyphoidal Salmonella required to cause gastroenteritis in humans,

201

reports indicate doses as low as 10 organisms [36, 37]. In this infection model we achieved

202

consistent infection of strep+ mice using only 103 organisms, indicating that this model can be

203

used to investigate a range of relevant infection doses.

206

Next, we sought to compare the development of clinical disease of C57Bl/6J and Nramp1+/+

207

mice infected using inoculated chow. Strep+ and strep- mice were inoculated with 104 or 108

208

CFU of Salmonella, respectively, and monitored for overt clinical signs at which point they were

209

euthanized. As expected, strep+ mice succumbed faster to disease compared to strep- mice

210

(Figs 5A and B). Only one strep- Nramp1+/+ mouse developed clinical signs and was euthanized

211

15 days p.i.; all others were euthanized at the experimental end point of 21 days p.i. This is

212

consistent with an intact microbiota and the ability of Nramp1+/+ mice to effectively combat

213

infection. The mouse euthanized 15 days p.i. showed very high bacterial loads in all tissues

214

except the liver and blood (open symbols in Fig 5F). Strep+ mice developed very high bacterial

215

loads in the intestinal tissues, especially C57Bl/6J mice, which also developed high loads in

216

systemic tissues (Figs 5C and D). This indicates that Nramp1 contributes to controlling

217

Salmonella infection both in systemic and intestinal sites. At the time of euthanasia, strep-

218

C57Bl/6J mice had higher and more consistent bacterial loads in all tissues compared to strep-

219

Nramp1+/+ (Figs 5E and F). It is interesting to note that although strep- C57Bl/6J mice have

220

lower intestinal bacterial loads compared to strep+ mice, they do go on to develop higher

221

systemic bacterial loads. This is probably a result of the prolonged survival of strep- mice

222

allowing additional time for the bacteria to replicate at systemic sites. These findings correlate

223

with other studies of oral infection of strep- susceptible and resistant mouse strains [8, 35, 38],

224

and show the reduced survival of strep+ mice.

236

Shorter periods of fasting increases hesitancy of mice to eat

237

inoculated chow

238

For practical reasons, it would be advantageous to have the option of varying the fasting time

239

although mice fasted for shorter times are less likely to eat inoculated chow. Therefore, to

240

determine how changing the duration of fasting would impact the method, we fasted mice for

241

4, 8 or 14 h and then measured the time taken to completely consume inoculated pieces of

242

chow. These mice were not streptomycin treated. After 14 h (o/n) of fasting, mice consumed

243

chow within 2 min, while shorter fasting resulted in longer consumption times, up to 23 min

244

(Fig 6A). The inoculum did not seem to affect consumption time, since mice fasted for 4 h and

245

offered chow inoculated with 108 CFU consumed the chow in a time frame similar to mice fed

246

104 CFU (Fig 6A). The very low consumption time after 14 h may be due to fasting taking place

247

overnight when mice are more active. Shorter fasting times required a modification to the

248

feeding procedure, where mice were moved into individual clean cages, offered a piece of chow

249

and then left undisturbed until consuming the whole chow piece. When comparing the organ

250

loads 3 days p.i. of mice fed 108 CFU after fasting for 4 h (Fig 6B) or 20 h (Fig 4), the shorter

251

fasting period led to lower bacterial loads in systemic tissues and in some of the intestinal

252

tissues. This indicates that shorter fasting times results in a delayed, or less efficient,

253

dissemination of Salmonella. In a study describing oral infection of mice with Listeria

254

monocytogenes the authors noted that mice sometimes had to be left undisturbed for up to 2 h

255

to eat the offered food, even after 24 h of fasting [28]. The reason for the mice more readily

256

eating the inoculum in this study may be due to the inoculated pieces of chow are derived from

257

their regular chow, a type of food they are already familiar with.

In summary, oral infection of mice using pieces of their regular chow inoculated with

264

Salmonella mimics the natural route of infection, is technically very simple and results in

265

reproducible infection while avoiding the stress and potential adverse side effects of oral

266

gavage. Further refinements to the method are possible, such as; adjusting fasting times; the

267

concentration of streptomycin in drinking water; and the time allowed for mice to access water

268

containing streptomycin. We expect that this approach would work for other strains of mice

269

and intestinal pathogens.

Materials and Methods

272

Ethics statement. All animal studies were carried out following the recommendations in the

273

Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 8th Edition (National Research Council), and

274

the animal study protocol was approved by the Rocky Mountain Laboratories Animal Care and

275

Use Committee. Protocol number 2017-021-E. Animals were either euthanized before the

276

development of clinical disease, at specified time points, or at the defined humane endpoint

277

(development of clinical disease: ruffled fur, hunched posture, lethargy).

278
279

Bacterial strains and growth conditions. Salmonella Typhimurium strain SL1344 was used for all

280

experiments. For infections, bacteria were grown in a 125 ml Erlenmeyer flask in 10 ml LB-

281

Miller containing 100 µg/ml streptomycin for 18 h at 37oC, with shaking at 225 RPM, and

282

diluted in sterile SPGS to get the correct inoculum in 10 µl (e.g. to get 104 CFU an overnight

283

culture was diluted 1:5000), the volume added to pieces of chow. For inoculum of 105 CFU and

284

higher, a wash step was included prior to dilution. 1 ml of the overnight culture was centrifuged

285

at 8000 G for 2 min, the supernatant was aspirated, and the bacterial pellet resuspended in 1

286

ml SPGS. In order to achieve a final concentration of 108 CFU in 10 µl, the bacterial pellet was

287

resuspended in 0.5 ml SPGS.

288

Preparation of chow pieces for infection. Mouse chow pellets (2016 Teklad Global 16% Protein

289

Rodent Diet, Envigo, Madison, Wisconsin USA), were broken into smaller pieces of about 4-5

290

mm in diameter by gentle tapping with a small hammer followed by trimming with forceps.

291

Selected pieces were gently tested for physical integrity, by dropping from a height of 4-5

292

inches, before 10 µl of inoculum was pipetted onto the surface. Prepared pieces were kept

293

separated in a petri dish during transport to the animal facility. One piece of inoculated chow

294

was retained for estimation of the CFU by plating.

295

Mouse chow infections. Except where specified, mice had unlimited access to food and water.

296

For Streptomycin pretreatment the antibiotic (5 mg/ml) was added to drinking water 42 – 46 h

297

prior to infection for 24 h. Mice were then moved to a clean cage (to limit coprophagy and

298

access to cached food), containing normal drinking water but no chow. After a period of 18 – 22

299

h (typically 20) individual mice were put in a clean empty cage (without bedding material) and

300

were then offered a piece of chow. Typically, mice ate the piece of chow immediately or within

301

a couple of min. For short fasting times (4 and 8 h) mice were left undisturbed until the chow

302

was eaten. Immediately after the inoculated chow was consumed, mice were returned to their

303

cage with unlimited access to food and water.

304

Mouse oral gavage infections. Mice were streptomycin treated 24 h before infection, using a

305

blunt end gavage needle with 100 µl SPGS containing 200 mg/ml streptomycin. For Salmonella

306

infection, mice were gavaged with bacteria in 100 µl SPGS. Mice were fasted for 4 h prior to all

307

gavages. For infections without streptomycin treatment, mice were only fasted prior to feeding.

308

Tissue collection and processing. Mice were euthanized by isoflurane inhalation followed by

309

exsanguination. Tissues were collected in screwcap tubes containing 500 µl SPGS and 3-4 2.0

310

mm zirconia beads (BioSpec Products) and homogenized using a Bead Mill 24 (Fisher Scientific,

311

4.85 m/s for 20 seconds). Tubes were weighed before and after organ collection. CFUs were

313

antibiotic.
