Abstract

15	  

Detecting subtle lesions in mammograms indicative of early breast cancer usually requires years of

16	  

experience. Well-designed training paradigms could be a strong tool for promoting perceptual

17	  

learning (PL) with rapid and long-lasting improvement in detectability of these subtle

18	  

mammographic lesions. Given that PL occurs without feedback about the accuracy of subjects’

19	  

responses, the role of feedback has been completely ignored in clinical applications of PL. However,

20	  

in this study, we found that the contents of the feedback profoundly and differentially influence the

21	  

formation and retention of PL to detect calcification and architectural distortion lesions, two types of

22	  

mammographic lesions that are frequently missed in mammographic screenings. We trained subjects

23	  

to detect one type of lesion in a mammogram and manipulated the content of the response feedback

24	  

during training for 3 groups (no feedback, correctness only, and both correctness and location of the

25	  

lesion). We found that PL occurred for both lesions when both correctness and location feedback

26	  

were provided. PL also occurred for calcifications but not for distortions when only correctness was

27	  

provided. No learning occurred without feedback for either lesion. A retest conducted six months

later showed that PL was retained only in the group with both correctness and location feedback for

29	  

both types of lesions. In contrast to the general consensus of basic PL studies, our results

30	  

demonstrate that the content of the response feedback is a determining factor in forming and

31	  

retaining PL to detect mammographic lesions.

Introduction

38	  

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and the second leading cause of cancer

39	  

mortality among women in the US1. In fact, each year, over 250,000 cases of breast cancer are

40	  

diagnosed, and 40,000 women die from breast cancer in the US. Screening mammography

41	  

significantly reduces breast cancer mortality by detecting early, curable breast cancer2, and since its

42	  

widespread utilization in the 1990s, it has resulted in approximately 250,000 fewer breast cancer

43	  

deaths in the US.

44	  

However, detection of lesions indicative of early breast cancer by mammography remains

45	  

challenging3-8. Among multiple types of mammographic lesions, it is relatively easy to detect

46	  

“masses”. However, subtle manifestations of breast cancer, such as fine grouped “calcification” or

47	  

“architectural distortion” lesions are known to be particularly difficult to detect without years of

48	  

experience, and account for a relatively high proportion of cancers missed at screening3, 6, 9-10 (Figure

49	  

1). Calcifications appear as white specks tightly grouped together, while architectural distortions

50	  

appear as lines radiating to a central point. Despite the importance of finding these lesions, the subtle

51	  

nature of these lesions has prevented the development of a method to train young inexperienced

52	  

radiologists to better detect these lesions.

59	  
60	  

It is well known that repetitive practice of a visual task to detect a subtle difference in visual

61	  

displays enhances task performance. This so-called perceptual learning (PL)11-12 has been studied

62	  

extensively as a useful tool to improve vision. Thus, PL might also be a strong training tool to

63	  

improve the detection of these subtle mammographic findings.

64	  

One distinguished aspect of PL is that it does not require feedback about the correctness of

65	  

the response to a given task13-15. PL developed with fake feedback is rapidly modified by a few trials

66	  

with correct feedback16. Another study shows that PL is facilitated only by positive fake feedback,

67	  

which indicates that the response is correct to an incorrect response but not by negative fake

68	  

feedback, which indicates that the response is incorrect to a correct response17. These findings led

69	  

researchers to suggest that feedback merely plays a role in temporarily shifting decision criteria or

70	  

enhancing the motivation of training18-19, 17 without changing a fundamental mechanism of PL. This

71	  

has greatly discouraged researchers from examining how feedback could improve PL in clinical

72	  

applications.

73	  

In contrast to such a general belief, we report here that feedback plays a fundamental role in

74	  

inducing learning to better detect lesions in screening mammograms. First, we find that different

75	  

contents of feedback are necessary for the PL of calcification and distortion lesions. Second, with no

76	  

feedback, no PL for either lesion was observed. Third, the retention of PL for either lesion depended

77	  

on the content of the feedback provided during training. These results indicate not only that feedback

78	  

plays a crucial role in the formation and long-term retention of PL for mammographic lesions but

79	  

also that the content of the feedback works differently on the PL of different types of lesions.

80	  
81	  

Results

82	  

The general design of the study is shown in Figure 2. Two factors were manipulated. The first

83	  

factor was the trained type of lesion (calcification lesion and architectural distortion lesion). The

84	  

second factor was the type of response feedback provided during training. There were three different

85	  

types of response feedback (Figure 3). In the detailed feedback condition, feedback about both the

86	  

correctness of detection and the correctness of identification of the location of the lesion were

87	  

provided. In the partial feedback condition, feedback only about the correctness of detection was

88	  

provided. Finally, in the no feedback condition, no feedback was provided. Each subject was

89	  

assigned to a combination of a trained lesion and type of response feedback during training. There

90	  

was a total of n = 12 subjects for each combination of trained lesion and response feedback (for a

91	  

total of n = 72 subjects). Subjects were college-age students with no medical background and

92	  

without any prior exposure to mammographic images (see Methods for details).

Training procedures. A total of six sessions were conducted on separate days. During the pretest, posttest

97	  

and retest, subjects were tested on both types of lesions without any response feedback. Between the pretest

98	  

and posttest, there were three training sessions during which different groups of subjects were trained either

99	  

on calcifications (orange) or architectural distortions (blue) with detailed feedback, partial feedback, or no

100	  

feedback (see Figure 3). The retest was conducted on a subset of subjects six months after the end of original

101	  

training.

Examples of training trials. Subjects were presented with a mammogram and asked to indicate the presence

105	  

or absence of a lesion by pressing one of two buttons on the keyboard. There was no time limit for their

106	  

response. If subjects reported the presence of a lesion, they were further asked to indicate the center of the

107	  

lesion by moving and clicking the cursor. The selected location was then highlighted by a blue crosshair.

108	  

Depending on the assigned feedback condition, subjects were then presented with different response

109	  

feedback conditions. In the detailed feedback condition (bottom left), subjects were informed about the

110	  

correctness of their response and the true location of the lesion. The mammogram was then shown again,

111	  

and the true location of the lesion was enclosed by a yellow circle. Subjects could compare the true location

112	  

with the location they had identified (denoted by blue crosshair). If there was no lesion, the mammogram was

113	  

presented without any yellow circle. In the partial feedback condition (bottom center), subjects were only

114	  

informed about the correctness of their response. In the no feedback condition (bottom right), subjects did not

115	  

receive any response feedback and moved on to the next trial.

116	  
117	  

Each subject performed pre- and posttests on both lesions. Thus, both trained and untrained

118	  

lesions were tested before and after training. These tests were conducted without any feedback. On

119	  

each of the pre- and posttest trials, subjects were asked to indicate whether a lesion was present or

120	  

absent in the mammogram by pressing one of two buttons on a keyboard. If they reported the

121	  

presence of a lesion, subjects were further asked to locate the lesion in the mammogram by moving

122	  

the cursor to the center of the lesion and clicking on the center. Finally, subjects identified which

123	  

type of lesion it was (calcification or distortion) by pressing one of two buttons on the keyboard.

124	  

Mammograms with lesions were presented intermixed with mammograms without any lesion. If a

125	  

lesion was present, the subject’s response was considered correct (hit) if the subject correctly

126	  

detected, located, and identified the type of lesion. If a lesion was absent, the subject’s response was

127	  

considered correct if the subject correctly rejected the presence of a lesion (correct rejection).

128	  

Performance was computed as observer sensitivity (d’). A total of 50 trials were conducted in each

129	  

test session (20% of the trials contained a mammogram with a calcification lesion, another 20%

130	  

contained a mammogram with a distortion lesion, and the remaining 60% were mammograms

131	  

without any lesion; see Methods for details).

132	  

In between the pretest and posttest, three training sessions were conducted on separate days.

133	  

In each of these sessions, subjects were trained on their assigned combination of lesion and response

134	  

feedback. For each trial, subjects were asked to indicate whether a lesion was present and, if so,

135	  

where it was located, in a similar manner to the pretest and posttest. During training, only

136	  

mammograms with the trained lesion type were presented intermixed with mammograms without

137	  

any lesions. Subjects were informed about their assigned lesion for training and thus were not asked

138	  

to indicate the type of lesion as part of their response during training. If a lesion was present, the

139	  

subject’s response was considered correct (hit) if the lesion was correctly detected and located. If a

140	  

lesion was absent, the subject’s response was considered correct if the subject rejected the presence

141	  

of a lesion. A total of 50 trials were conducted in each training session (in 20% of the trials, the

142	  

mammogram contained a lesion).

143	  

A subset of subjects (n = 43 in total) was available for a retest that was conducted six months

144	  

after the end of original training, with exactly the same procedures as those of the pretest and

145	  

posttest. See Methods for more details.

146	  
147	  

Perceptual Learning of Trained Lesion

148	  

Figure 4 shows the mean performance (corresponding to observer sensitivity, d’) across

149	  

subjects for the pretest and posttest (see Supplementary Figure 1 for performance in training sessions

150	  

and Supplementary Figure 2 for hit and false-alarm rates). A 2 x 2 x 3 mixed ANOVA with a within-

151	  

subject factor of session (pre, post) and between-subject factors of trained type of lesion

152	  

(calcification, distortion) and content of response feedback (detailed, partial, none) showed a

153	  

significant three-way interaction of session, trained type of lesion and feedback [F(2,66) = 3.16, p =

154	  

0.049, partial η2 = 0.09], suggesting that the content of response feedback influenced PL differently

155	  

for different lesions. Furthermore, there was a significant two-way interaction between session and

156	  

feedback [F(2,66) = 6.21, p = 0.003, partial η2 = 0.16]. The ANOVA also yielded a significant main

157	  

effect of trained type of lesion [F(1,66) = 58.0, p < 0.001, partial η2 = 0.47], suggesting that d’ was

158	  

greater for calcifications than distortions across sessions and feedback conditions (Figure 4). There

159	  

was a significant main effect of session [F(1,66) = 30.4, p < 0.001, partial η2 = 0.32], indicating that

160	  

d’ was greater after training across different feedback conditions. No other main effect or interaction

161	  

was significant.

173	  

Post hoc t-tests were conducted to illustrate the relationship among trained lesion, content of

174	  

response feedback and PL from pre- to posttesting. In the detailed feedback condition, PL occurred

175	  

from pre- to posttesting for both calcifications [t(11) = 2.80, p = 0.02, d = 1.23] and distortions [t(11)

176	  

= 5.98, p < 0.001, d = 2.49]. However, in the partial feedback condition, PL occurred only for

177	  

calcifications [t(11) = 3.18, p = 0.009, d = 1.33] but not for distortions [t(11) = 1.09, p = 0.30, d =

178	  

0.51]. In the training condition without feedback, there was no PL for either calcifications [t(11) =

179	  

1.64, p = 0.13, d = 0.68] or distortions [t(11) = -0.68, p = 0.51, d = -0.23].

180	  
181	  

Retention of Perceptual Learning for Trained Lesions

182	  

We conducted a retest six months after the end of original training with the subset of subjects

183	  

from training conditions with PL who were available for retesting (Figure 5; see Supplementary

184	  

Figure 3 for hit and false alarm rates). If subjects completely retained PL, we expected that d’ would

185	  

not be significantly different between retest and posttest but would be significantly greater during the

186	  

retest compared with the pretest. The results showed that in the detailed feedback condition, the d’

187	  

for calcifications in the retest was significantly greater than in the pretest [t(8) = 2.41, p = 0.04, d =

188	  

1.35] but not significantly different from the posttest [t(8) = -1.02, p = 0.34, d = -0.10] (Figure 5a).

189	  

For distortions, although the d' in the retest was significantly greater than in the pretest [t(8) = 3.52, p

190	  

= 0.008, d = 1.57], it was significantly smaller than in the posttest [t(8) = -4.47, p = 0.002, d = -0.70]

191	  

(Figure 5b). These results suggest that in the detailed feedback conditions, PL for calcifications was

192	  

completely retained after six months, while PL for distortions was partially retained.

193	  

PL also occurred for calcifications with partial feedback (Figure 4). However, the d’ for

194	  

calcifications in the retest was not significantly different from the d’ in either the pretest [t(8) = 1.17,

195	  

p = 0.28, d = 0.40] or the posttest [t(8) = -1.45, p = 0.19, d = -0.97] (Figure 5c). This suggests that PL

196	  

for calcifications in the partial feedback training condition was not retained after six months.

208	  

Perceptual Learning of Untrained Lesions

209	  

We also analyzed whether observer sensitivity changed for the untrained lesion in each

210	  

training group (that is, performance on distortions in the pre- and posttests for subjects who trained

211	  

on calcifications and vice versa, see Supplementary Figures 4 and 5). A 2 x 2 x 3 mixed ANOVA

212	  

with the within-subject factor of session (pre, post) and between-subject factors of untrained type of

213	  

lesion (calcification, distortion) and content of response feedback for the trained lesion (detailed,

214	  

partial, no feedback) was conducted. Importantly, there was no significant interaction between

215	  

session, untrained type of lesion and content of the response feedback [F(2,66) = 0.61, p = 0.55,

216	  

partial η2 = 0.02]. Furthermore, there were no significant interactions between session and content of

217	  

the response feedback [F(2,66) = 0.19, p = 0.83, partial η2 = 0.01] or between untrained type of

218	  

lesion and content of the response feedback [F(2,66) = 0.21, p = 0.81, partial η2 = 0.01]. There was

219	  

no significant main effect of content of the response feedback [F(2,66) = 0.73, p = 0.49, partial η2 =

220	  

0.02]. Taken together, these results suggest that the content of the response feedback given for the

221	  

trained type of lesion during training did not influence d’ in any session for any type of untrained

222	  

lesions.

223	  

The ANOVA yielded a significant interaction between session and untrained type of lesion

224	  

[F(1,66) = 5.93, p = 0.02, partial η2 = 0.08], suggesting that d’ was greater for untrained

225	  

calcifications compared with untrained distortions in the posttest compared with the pretest

226	  

(Supplementary Figure 4). Furthermore, there was a significant main effect of session [F(1,66) =

227	  

5.97, p = 0.02, partial η2 = 0.08], suggesting that d’ for untrained lesions was better in the posttest

228	  

compared with the pretest. Moreover, there was a significant main effect of untrained type of lesion

229	  

[F(1,66) = 25.8, p < 0.001, partial η2 = 0.28], indicating that d’ on untrained calcifications was

230	  

superior to untrained distortions across tests (Supplementary Figure 4).

231	  
232	  

Retention of Perceptual Learning for Untrained Lesion

233	  

The retention of improvements in d’ for untrained calcifications was examined in the retest

234	  

(Supplementary Figures 6 and 7). Since the comparison between pretest and posttest did not indicate

235	  

any influence of the response feedback on the untrained lesions (see above), data from the subjects

236	  

were combined across feedback conditions. The results show that the d’ for untrained calcifications

237	  

during retest was not significantly different from that from either pretest [t(24) = 1.12, p = 0.27, d =

238	  

0.21] or posttest [t(24) = -1.15, p = 0.26, d = -0.39], indicating that PL for untrained calcifications

239	  

from pre- to posttest (see above) was not retained after six months.

241	  

Discussion

242	  

In this study, we investigated how response feedback during training influences the PL of

243	  

lesions in mammograms. Naïve subjects were trained on either calcification or architectural

244	  

distortion lesions, both of which are indicative of early breast cancer and are commonly missed in

245	  

mammogram screenings3-4, 7. During training, the content of the response feedback was varied

246	  

between subjects. In training with detailed feedback, subjects were informed about the correctness of

247	  

their response and about the true location of the lesion. In training with partial feedback, subjects

248	  

only learned about the correctness of their response but could not review the true location of the

249	  

lesion. A third group of subjects trained without any response feedback. The results of our study

250	  

suggest that the content of the response feedback influenced the PL of calcifications and distortions

251	  

differently. The PL of calcifications was already observed in training with partial feedback, whereas

252	  

the PL of distortions only occurred in training with detailed feedback. However, the PL for both

253	  

lesions showed long-term retention only in training with detailed feedback.
PL of low-level visual features can occur without external feedback during training13-15. In

254	  
255	  

addition, the effects of feedback on PL are short-lasting16. These results have led researchers to

256	  

generally believe that feedback does not play a fundamental role in PL. To our knowledge, no

257	  

research has been conducted to systematically determine the role of feedback in PL in clinical

258	  

applications. In contrast to the general belief that feedback is of little importance to PL, the results of

259	  

the present study indicate that feedback is indispensable to the PL of lesions in mammograms and

260	  

that the choice of the right type of feedback makes visual training highly effective and long-lasting

261	  

for improving the detectability of the trained lesion.

262	  

These results include the following findings: (1) no PL was observed for either calcification

263	  

or distortion lesions when subjects trained without feedback; (2) PL for calcifications could occur

264	  

when subjects were only informed about the correctness of their response after each trial without any

265	  

opportunity to review the examined mammogram one more time (partial feedback); (3) in contrast,

266	  

significant improvements in the detection of distortions were only observed when subjects reviewed

267	  

the mammogram and the true location of the lesion (detailed feedback); and (4) long-lasting

268	  

improvements in detecting calcification and distortion lesions were only induced by detailed

269	  

feedback during training. Taken together, these results indicate that response feedback plays a

270	  

fundamental role in inducing a long-lasting PL of lesions in mammographic screenings.

271	  

In basic and clinical studies in which feedback is used to visually train subjects, partial

272	  

feedback20-21 or detailed feedback22-23 has never been used systematically. Our results suggest that

273	  

training using partial feedback is sufficient for PL of calcifications. However, training using partial

274	  

feedback is not sufficient for PL of distortions. This difference in the effectiveness of partial

275	  

feedback might be related to differences in the difficulty of detecting calcifications and distortions.

276	  

Specifically, our results show that subjects achieved better detection performance for calcifications

277	  

compared with distortions before training (see Figure 4). Thus, the effectiveness of the response

278	  

feedback might be associated with the difficulty of detecting different types of lesions. However,

279	  

contrary to this assumption, we found that PL was not long-lasting without detailed feedback, neither

280	  

for calcifications nor for distortions. This indicates that detailed feedback plays a crucial role, at least

281	  

in long-term PL, for both calcifications and distortions, irrespective of their detection difficulty.

282	  

We found that the effects of feedback were specific to the PL of the trained type of lesion and

283	  

did not transfer to the untrained type of lesion. This is in accord with the hypothesis that the PL of

284	  

mammographic lesions occurs at a relatively low stage of visual processing. Recently, methods to

285	  

eliminate the location specificity of PL have been developed24-25. The integration of adequate

286	  

feedback with these methods may help generalize the PL of mammographic lesions to a greater

287	  

degree.

288	  

Why does detailed feedback induce a stable PL? We speculate that the opportunity for

289	  

subjects to review their responses together with the correct response after each training trial might

290	  

serve as an “instructor” to PL. Although subjects were familiarized with the features that characterize

291	  

different mammographic lesions before training, the large degree of individual variation of the

292	  

trained lesion in mammograms from different patients renders the creation of a general search

293	  

template for calcification or distortion lesions difficult. Feedback after each trial with information

294	  

about the true location of the lesion might facilitate the creation of such a search template over the

295	  

course of training and thus induce stable and long-lasting PL.

296	  
297	  

To conclude, PL with response feedback significantly improves the detectability of subtle
lesions in mammograms by naïve subjects. We found that feedback about the correctness of the

298	  

response improves the detectability of calcifications (partial feedback), while training with feedback

299	  

about the location of a lesion as well as the correctness of the response (detailed feedback) is

300	  

necessary for the development of PL of distortion lesions. However, long-lasting improvements for

301	  

both lesions depend on detailed feedback. Thus, the content of the response feedback plays a crucial

302	  

role in the PL of mammographic findings. The results of this study indicate the importance of future

303	  

studies on the effect of the content of feedback on PL in basic research and clinical investigations.

Methods

306	  
307	  

Subjects

308	  

A total of n = 72 subjects [average age (± SE) = 21.1 ± 0.44 years, 44 females, 66 right-

309	  

handers] participated in the study. Subjects gave informed, written consent prior to participation. The

310	  

study was approved by the local ethics board at Brown University and the University of Colorado,

311	  

Denver.

312	  
313	  

Breast Images

314	  

Two-dimensional grayscale mammographic images obtained from routine screening

315	  

examinations on asymptomatic women performed using Hologic Selenia units at the University of

316	  

Colorado, Denver, were used for the study. Images were presented at a resolution of 2000 x 1125

317	  

pixels. Each image was evaluated by an expert radiologist (E.R., 22 years of experience) and

318	  

classified as normal or as having either a calcification or distortion lesion. Images consisted of either

319	  

a single 2D image or a single 1 mm thick tomosynthesis slice and were deemed representative of

320	  

either the lesion or normal findings by E.R. Each mammogram was from a different patient. In the

321	  

majority of cases (286 out of 330 mammograms in total), both breasts of the patient were scanned

322	  

and presented side-by-side to subjects in the experiment. The remaining 14 mammograms were only

323	  

collected for one breast. If there was a lesion, it was only present in one breast. The image

324	  

background was black, and no additional preprocessing was performed on the mammograms. There

325	  

was a pool of 60 mammograms with calcification lesions, 60 mammograms with distortion lesions,

326	  

and 210 normal mammograms. The same pool of images was used for each subject. Images were

327	  

randomly sorted into one of the six sessions for each subject.

328	  
329	  

Experimental Schedule

330	  

The study consisted of six sessions, which were conducted on separate days (Figure 2). In the

331	  

first session (pretest), detection performance for calcifications and distortions was measured prior to

332	  

training in each subject. No feedback about performance was provided during the test. In the second,

333	  

third, and fourth sessions, subjects were trained either on calcification or distortion lesions

334	  

(depending on group assignment, see below) and received feedback after each training trial

335	  

(depending on the feedback condition, see below). In the fifth session (posttest), performance after

336	  

training was measured as in the pretest for both the trained and untrained lesions. On average (± SE),

337	  

6.34 ± 0.26 months after the posttest, the retention of PL was measured in a retest session similar to

338	  

the pre- and posttests for both the trained und untrained lesions. All subjects (n = 72) participated in

339	  

the training and the pre- and posttests. There was a total of n = 12 subjects for each combination of a

340	  

trained lesion and feedback during training. A subset of trained subjects (n = 43) was available for

341	  

the retest.

342	  
343	  

Pretest/Posttest/Retest

344	  

A total of 50 mammograms were presented to the subjects in each test. Ten mammograms

345	  

contained a calcification lesion, another ten contained a distortion lesion, and the remaining

346	  

mammograms did not contain any lesions. Mammograms were presented in a random order. On each

347	  

trial, subjects were asked to indicate whether a lesion was present in the mammogram by pressing

348	  

one of two buttons for “yes” and “no” on a keyboard. If subjects indicated the presence of a lesion,

349	  

they were further asked to locate the center of the lesion by a mouse-click. Finally, subjects were

350	  

asked to report whether the lesion was a calcification or a distortion by pressing one of two buttons

351	  

on the keyboard. If subjects reported that no lesion was present, they moved on to the next case.

352	  

Subjects could move each mammogram to left and right or up and down. Moreover, they could zoom

353	  

into the mammogram to magnify anatomical details or zoom out. Subjects could search the

354	  

mammogram overtly by making eye movements. If they located a lesion, the subjects could change

355	  

their decision until making a final confirmation of their selection. The experiment was self-paced

356	  

with no time limit. No feedback was provided. The completion of a test session took ~ 30 min.

357	  

Subjects were seated 60 cm away from the computer screen (size: 43° x 27°). No chin rest was used.

358	  

Room lights were turned off. Stimuli were presented with the Psychophysics Toolbox26-27 running in

359	  

MATLAB (The MathWorks, Natick, MA). Prior to each test session, instruction slides with example

360	  

mammograms with distortion and calcification lesions were presented to the subjects.

361	  
362	  

Training

363	  

There were two training groups (calcification and distortion lesions) and three different

364	  

feedback conditions (detailed, partial, or no feedback). Each subject was randomly assigned to a

365	  

combination of a trained lesion and feedback condition.

366	  

Training sessions were similar to test sessions except that 10 mammograms with either

367	  

calcification or distortion lesions (dependent on the training group) were included along with 40

368	  

mammograms without any lesion. Subjects were informed about their assignment to either

369	  

calcification or distortion lesions training prior to the first training session. On each training trial,

370	  

subjects were asked to indicate whether the assigned lesion was present in the mammogram, and if

371	  

so, they were further asked to report where the center of the lesion was located by moving the cursor

372	  

and clicking on the center. Detailed feedback, partial feedback, or no feedback was provided at the

373	  

end of each trial. In the detailed feedback condition, subjects were informed about the correctness of

374	  

their response as well as the true location of the lesion. This was done by providing a written

375	  

statement about the correctness of the response to the subjects in green (for a correct response) or red

376	  

(for an incorrect response) (Figure 3a). Depending on the correctness of the subject response, this

377	  

statement could read: “Response correct: lesion is present”. “Response correct: lesion is not present”.

378	  

“Response incorrect: lesion is present”. “Response incorrect: lesion is not present”. The

379	  

mammogram was then presented again, and the location of the lesion identified by the subject as

380	  

well as the true location of the lesion (if it was present) were indicated. A blue crosshair indicated the

381	  

location of the center of the lesion as identified by the subject, and a yellow circle enclosed the true

382	  

location of the whole lesion (if a lesion was present; if no lesion was present, only the blue crosshair

383	  

with the subject response was shown). Subjects could magnify or move the mammogram in different

384	  

directions for review. In the partial feedback condition, only feedback about the correctness of the

385	  

response was provided to the subjects. As in the detailed feedback condition, a written statement was

386	  

presented at the end of the trial (Figure 3b). In the no feedback condition, subjects did not learn about

387	  

the correctness of their response at the end of the trial (Figure 3c) and were only requested to press a

388	  

button to move on to the next trial. Each training session was self-paced and took ~ 30 min.

389	  
390	  

Analysis

391	  

Performance in test and training sessions was quantified as observer sensitivity (d’). During

392	  

pretest, posttest and retest, the subject’s response was considered a hit when the following three

393	  

conditions were all met: (1) the subject correctly identified the presence of a lesion, (2) the center of

394	  

the lesion as identified by the subject was within the area corresponding to the true location of the

395	  

lesion and (3) the subject correctly identified whether the lesion was a calcification or an

396	  

architectural distortion. If one of the three conditions was not met or if the subject incorrectly

397	  

indicated the absence of a lesion, the response was considered a miss. If the subject incorrectly

398	  

indicated the presence of a lesion, the subject response was considered a false alarm. If no lesion was

399	  

present and the subject correctly indicated the absence of a lesion, the subject response was

400	  

considered a correct rejection. Hit and false alarm rates were computed separately for calcifications

401	  

and distortions. For training sessions, hits corresponded to trials where subjects correctly indicated

402	  

the presence of the trained lesion and correctly identified its location.
