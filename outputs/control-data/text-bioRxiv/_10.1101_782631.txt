ABSTRACT
NMR spectroscopy provides a powerful approach for the characterisation of chemical exchange and molecular
interactions by analysis of series of experiments acquired over the course of a titration measurement. The
appearance of NMR resonances undergoing chemical exchange depends on the frequency difference relative
to the rate of exchange, and in the case of one-dimensional experiments chemical exchange regimes are well
established and well known. However, two-dimensional experiments present additional complexity, as at least
one additional frequency difference must be considered. Here we provide a systematic classification of chemical
exchange regimes in two-dimensional NMR spectra. We highlight important differences between exchange in
HSQC and HMQC experiments, that on a practical level result in more severe exchange broadening in HMQC
spectra, but show that complementary alternatives to the HMQC are available in the form of HZQC and HDQC
experiments. We present the longitudinal relaxation optimised SOFAST-H(Z/D)QC experiment for the simultaneous
acquisition of sensitivity-enhanced HZQC and HDQC spectra, and the longitudinal and transverse relaxation
optimised BEST-ZQ-TROSY for analysis of large molecular weight systems. We describe the application of
these experiments to the characterisation of the interaction between the Hsp90 N-terminal domain and a small
molecule ligand, and show that the independent analysis of HSQC, HMQC, HZQC and HDQC experiments
provides improved confidence in the fitted dissociation constant and dissociation rate. Joint analysis of such data
may provide improved sensitivity to detect and analyse more complex multi-state interaction mechanisms such as
induced fit or conformational selection.

Introduction
The NMR lineshape (i.e. intensity, frequency, phase and linewidth) of a spin undergoing chemical exchange (i.e. a
spin that is interconverting between multiple states in dynamic equilibrium) is well known to provide a powerful
spectroscopic probe of the underlying exchange process. This lineshape may be modulated by a variety of means,
including rf pulse sequences such as CPMG pulse trains1 , R1ρ spin locks2, 3 or saturation with a single frequency or
frequency comb4–6 ; field shuttling7 ; or variation of external parameters such as protein or ligand concentration or
temperature8, 9 . The resulting modulations may then be fitted to determine details of the exchange process such as
chemical shift differences, populations of states, and the rate of exchange between them. As such, NMR spectroscopy
provide an indispensable, label-free tool for studying both intramolecular dynamics and biomolecular and other
host-guest interactions10–13 .
The effects of chemical exchange on lineshapes in one-dimensional NMR spectra are well understood14 .
Depending on the frequency difference, ∆ω, between two resonances, A and B, that are in exchange with rate

regimes may be defined that have characteristic limiting behaviour. We do not distinguish in this work between
the slow and slow-intermediate or fast and fast-intermediate regimes, which instead are encompassed within our
definitions of the slow and fast exchange limits. We also assume that there is no significant difference in relaxation
rates between states. In the slow exchange regime (kex  |∆ω|), resonance intensities are modulated according to
their population (plus a lifetime line broadening contribution to the linewidth) but no chemical shift perturbations are
observed (to first order in kex ). In contrast, in the fast exchange regime (kex  |∆ω|) a single resonance is observed
at a population weighted average of the original chemical shifts, and with an exchange-induced contribution to
the linewidth determined by both the frequency difference between states and the exchange rate (discussed further
below). Lastly, when the exchange rate and frequency difference are comparable, severe line broadening can
result (the ‘intermediate exchange’ regime). For equal populations of the exchanging states A and B, this is best
characterised by the ‘coalescence point’ at which the two original resonances can no longer be distinguished (defined
√
by the vanishing first and second derivatives of the lineshape), which occurs when |∆ω| = 2kex 14 . Alternatively,
exchange regimes may be characterised by the dependence of the exchange-induced line broadening term Rex on the
static magnetic field strength, B0 , through the parameter α = d(ln Rex )/d(ln B0 ) which varies from 0 to 2 between
the slow and fast exchange limits15 .
As the appearance of one-dimensional NMR spectra can be modulated strongly by the chemical exchange
process, observed spectra may be fitted quantitatively to numerical solutions of the Bloch-McConnell equations
governing the evolution of magnetisation vectors (or at a more sophisticated level of theory, to the Liouville-von
Neumann equation for the time evolution of the quantum mechanical density operator) in order to determine
the microscopic rate constants for the exchange process, and the populations and chemical shifts of the various
states16, 17 . This procedure, termed ‘lineshape analysis’ or ‘dynamic NMR’, is particularly effective when a series
of one-dimensional spectra can be analysed as a function of an external parameter such as temperature or ligand
concentration, in order to determine parameters such as activation energies and dissociation constants.
The analysis of interactions within more complex macromolecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids, requires
the use of two-dimensional NMR experiments such as the HSQC (heteronuclear single quantum correlation)18 or
HMQC (heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation)19 to resolve the hundreds of resonances from component
residues. While in some cases it is possible to perform one-dimensional lineshape analysis on cross-sections from
such spectra20, 21 , this approach risks a number of systematic errors8 . Indeed, exchange of transverse magnetisation
during preparation, chemical shift evolution and mixing periods has recently been shown to give rise to coherent
cross-peaks that cannot be account for by one-dimensional treatments9 . Instead, we have previously developed a
truly two-dimensional lineshape analysis strategy, based on fitting observed two-dimensional spectra to complete
quantum mechanical simulations of the underlying pulse sequence8 . The analysis has been implemented in a
software tool, TITAN, which has since been applied to study a wide range of biomolecular interactions22–24 .
Two-dimensional lineshape analysis has two particular differences from the well-known one-dimensional theory.
Firstly, there are now two chemical shift differences, ∆δI and ∆δS , to consider and therefore it is not always possible
to classify resonances as being simply in fast or slow exchange regimes. Secondly, in experiments such as the HMQC,
chemical shift evolution occurs as a combination of zero and double quantum coherences, with frequencies ωS ± ωI ,
and it is the differences in these frequencies between states that should be compared to the exchange rate rather
than the difference in single quantum frequencies. Indeed, we remarked in our original work on two-dimensional
lineshape analysis that HSQC and HMQC experiments can give rise to different patterns of exchange broadening
that must therefore be analysed with the appropriate framework8 .
In this work, we expand on these earlier observations, by presenting a systematic classification of chemical
exchange regimes appropriate for two-dimensional NMR experiments. We also consider zero- and double-quantum
correlation experiments (HZQC and HDQC respectively), and describe new sensitivity-optimised pulse sequences for

Results
Classification of exchange regimes in two-dimensional NMR experiments
In this work, we consider heteronuclear correlation spectra involving two spins, labelled I and S, undergoing
chemical exchange between two states, A and B, with rate kex = kAB + kBA . We will also assume that the difference
in relaxation rates between states is negligible relative to the frequency difference, i.e. ∆R2  |∆ω|. It is then
convenient to define the relative frequency differences ξX = ∆ωX /kex , such that |ξ |  1 represents the fast exchange
limit and |ξ |  1 represents the slow exchange limit (in a one-dimensional sense). The canonical coalesence point
√
√
|∆ω| = 2kex therefore corresponds to |ξ | = 214 .
We will focus in particular on the analysis of molecular interactions using NMR titration measurements,
exemplified by the interaction of a protein, P, with a ligand, L, to form a complex, PL:
kon

−−
*
P+L )
−
− PL
koff

where the dissociation constant Kd = koff /kon . As the free ligand concentration, [L], always increases as ligand is
added, the exchange rate, kex = kon [L] + koff , must also increase monotically with the fraction bound, pB , such that
kex = koff /(1 − pB )25 . The relative frequency difference, ξ = ∆ω/kex = (1 − pB )∆ω/koff , therefore decreases as the
titration proceeds, and so it is not always possible to classify a spin system as being in a single exchange regime
throughout a titration. However, as the effects of chemical exchange on resonance lineshapes are most strongly
manifest at the titration midpoint (pB = 1/2), we will generally use the relative frequency differences at this point,
ξ = ∆ω/2koff , as a convenient point of reference in discussions below.
Single quantum correlation experiments. Single quantum (SQ) correlation experiments, such as the HSQC or

(amide) TROSY experiments18, 26 , have two characteristic parameters, ξI and ξS , corresponding to the frequency
differences in direct and indirect dimensions. Four two-dimensional exchange regimes may therefore be identified:
fast exchange in both dimensions (FF, |ξI |  1 and |ξS |  1); slow exchange in both dimensions (SS, |ξI |  1 and
|ξS |  1); fast exchange in the direct dimension and slow exchange in the indirect dimension (FS, |ξI |  1 and
|ξS |  1); and lastly, slow exchange in the direct dimension and fast exchange in the indirect dimension (SF, |ξI |  1
and |ξS |  1). These regimes are marked schematically on a set of frequency axes in Fig. 1A. ‘Fast exchange’, in
the sense of 2D resonances progressively changing frequency along the course of a titration, will only be observed
within the ‘FF’ region where exchange is fast with respect to all relevant frequency differences.
The observed perturbation ∆ωobs to the frequency of the single resonance observed in the fast exchange limit, or
to the frequency of the resonance of state A observed in the slow exchange limit, and the exchange contribution
to the resonance linewidth, Rex , have been calculated for the indirect dimension to second order in ξ and ξ −1 for
the fast and slow exchange limits respectively (see SI text). The resulting expressions recapitulate generally well
known results25 and are presented in Table 1 for later comparison. In the fast exchange limit the observed frequency
is simply the population weighted average of the individual states, while in the slow exchange limit a much smaller
frequency perturbation is observed, that is only second order in the (relatively slow) exchange rate and inversely
proportional to the (relatively large) frequency difference. Conversely, in fast exchange the exchange-induced line
broadening is second order in the relatively small frequency difference, and inversely proportional to the relatively
large exchange rate, and therefore will also generally be small in magnitude. The exchange contribution to the
linewidth in slow exchange is determined by the lifetime line broadening, and is therefore more significant for
the minor state where the populations are highly skewed. Corresponding relations for the direct dimension can be

fast exchange limit, or of the resonance of state A in the slow exchange limit, calculated for single, multiple, zero
and double quantum evolution periods.
To illustrate these exchange regimes, a series of 2D spectra have been simulated according to a titration of a
protein with a ligand, interacting through a simple two-state mechanism as discussed above. Ligand concentrations
were chosen (relative to an arbitrary Kd ) to give bound populations varying uniformly from 0 to 99.9%. Chemical
shift differences were defined according to the relative frequency difference at the titration midpoint, ξ = ∆ω/2koff ,
to represent the four 2D exchange regimes identified above. The simulated spectra are plotted in Fig. 1B–E, and the
corresponding relative frequency differences, decreasing along the course of the titration, are marked on Fig. 1A.
From these simulations, we observe that exchange in the ‘SS’ and ‘FF’ regimes (Fig. 1C and D respectively) appears

as might be expected from 1D analogues. However, in the mixed ‘FS’ and ‘SF’ regimes more complex behaviour is
observed, in which progressive chemical shift changes are observed along the ‘fast’ dimension only (Fig. 1B and E).
Zero and double quantum correlation experiments. Having examined exchange regimes within the HSQC
experiment, and as a prelude to the analysis of the more complicated HMQC experiment, we have considered
exchange within zero and double quantum correlation experiments. Although not commonly acquired, amide zero
quantum coherences have favourable relaxation rates, intermediate between single or multiple quantum coherences
and the TROSY coherence H β N ±27 , while for methyl spin systems sharper lines can be obtained in HZQC spectra
than in the standard ‘methyl-TROSY’ HMQC experiment itself28 . Zero and double quantum correlation experiments
have also been suggested as a means of alleviating exchange broadening in residues undergoing conformational
exchange29 .
The analysis of HZQC and HDQC experiments is essentially identical to that of the HSQC, with the difference
in single quantum frequencies, ξS , replaced by the difference in zero or double quantum frequencies, ξS ± ξI , as
appropriate. Therefore, four two-dimensional exchange regimes can be identified (Fig. 2A,B) as described above for
the HSQC (Fig. 1A). The observed frequency perturbations and exchange contribution to relaxation rates in the
indirect dimensions have again been calculated (see SI texst) and are tabulated for slow and fast exchange limits in
Table 1.

It may be observed that the ranges of parameter space within the fast exchange (FF) regime for HZQC and
HDQC experiments are complementary (Fig. 2A,B). This has two practical implications. Firstly, a resonance
that is in the FS exchange regime within one experiment may be within the FF regime in the other, and this may
facilitate tracking chemical shift changes during the course of a titration. This is illustrated for the simulated titration
spectra shown in Fig. 2C–F. Secondly, due to the differences in exchange regimes between these experiments,

two-dimensional lineshape analysis conducted on both sets of experiments should prove complementary, and their
independent analysis may provide an additional layer of validation on results obtained from such fitting.
Multiple quantum correlation experiments. In the HMQC experiment, magnetisation evolves as a mixture of

zero and double quantum coherences during t1 19 . Thus, in contrast to the HSQC, there are three characteristic
parameters to be considered (relative the to exchange rate): the frequency difference, ξI , in the direct dimension, and
the differences in both the zero and double quantum frequencies, ξS ± ξI , in the indirect dimension. From this, seven
two-dimensional exchange regimes may therefore be identified, corresponding to fast and slow exchange in the
direct dimension, and fast and slow exchange with respect to both zero and double quantum frequency differences, as
indicated in Fig. 3A. ‘Fast exchange’ behaviour of 2D resonances will only be observed within the ‘FFF’ regime, in
which exchange is fast with respect to all frequency differences. This is a smaller region of parameter space than for
the single quantum experiment (Fig. 1A), with the practical consequence that during titrations it is likely to be more
difficult to follow progressive chemical shift changes using HMQC experiments than using HSQC experiments.
As for the HSQC experiment, the observed chemical shift perturbations and the exchange contribution to the
resonance line broadening in the indirect dimension have been calculated for the slow and fast zero/double quantum
exchange regimes and are tabulated in Table 1. The most significant difference between the HSQC and HMQC
experiments is that chemical shift changes and line broadening in the indirect dimension now depend upon the
frequency difference in the direct dimension also. Two observations are particularly striking. Firstly, the exchange
contribution to line broadening, Rex , in the fast (FZ FD ) exchange regime scales as ∆ωS2 + ∆ωI2 , rather than ∆ωS2 as
in the single quantum case. Thus, HMQC resonances are subject to more significant line broadening than in the
equivalent HSQC experiment. This may have practical consequences for the ability to detect and track chemical
shift changes over the course of a titration experiment. Secondly, chemical shift perturbations in the slow (SZ SD )
exchange regime are proportional to ∆ωS /(∆ωS2 − ∆ωI2 ). When the chemical shift difference in the direct dimension
is large this term can become close to zero or even change sign, such that the initial direction of chemical shift
changes over the course of a titration is hard to discern, or even occurs in the opposite direction to the bound
peak position; we have labelled this regime ‘SS− ’ (Fig. 3A). A calculation of chemical shift perturbations across
all exchange regimes, in the limit pB  1, indicates that this reversal occurs when ξI2 > ξS2 + 1. This region of
parameter space is delineated with a blue line in Fig. 3B. This effect has previously been noted in the context
of relaxation dispersion experiments, where the difference in chemical shifts of a resonance between HSQC and
HMQC experiments can be used to infer the sign of the chemical shift difference to the unobserved excited state30 .
It is also possible to calculate the coalescence point for the indirect dimension of the HMQC experiment. In
√
contrast to the HSQC, for which the coalescence point occurs at ξS = ± 2, in the HMQC the coalescence point must
be defined as a function of the frequency difference ξI also. By calculating the time evolution of the magnetisation
analytically, including the central π Iˆx pulse to interconvert zero and double quantum coherences, and then taking the
Fourier transform of the result, we obtain the lineshape in the indirect dimension, y(ξS ; ξI ). The coalescence point is
then defined by a vanishing second derivative, d 2 y/dξS2 = 0, which yields:


ξI2 ξI2 − 3 ξS4 − 3ξI6 + 9ξI4 + 19ξI2 + 4 ξS2 + ξI6 + ξI4 + 8 = 0

Solutions to this expression are plotted as red lines in Fig. 3A. Two further roots of Eq. 1 exist when |ξS | & 8, but
inspection of the relevant lineshapes indicates that this does not correspond to coalescence behaviour but rather to
distortions in the baseline between two well-resolved resonances. As expected, when ξI is zero then the coalescence
point is identical to that of the HSQC, while for |ξI | < 1 we observe that the region of parameter space below the
coalescence point is well approximated by the requirement of being in fast exchange with respect to both zero and
double quantum frequency differences (Fig. 3A). However, when |ξI | becomes large then the coalescence point tends

towards |ξS | = 1/ 3. Moreover, direct inspection of simulated lineshapes within this regime (ξI  1, ξS < 1/ 3)
finds that, consistent with the limits calculated in Table 1, progressive chemical shift perturbations are not observed,
and instead resonances interconvert with intensity modulations more similar to classical slow exchange behaviour
(Fig. S1). Thus, for multiple quantum dimensions, we conclude that classical fast exchange behaviour is only
observed within the FZ FD regime.
To illustrate these cases further, a series of 2D titration spectra have been simulated (Fig. 3B–G), with relative
frequency differences as indicated in Fig. 3A. In some cases, the simulated HMQC spectra are very similar to the
equivalent HSQC spectra (Fig. 1). For example, HMQC spectra within the FSS regime (Fig. 3B), where ξI is small,
are comparable to HSQC spectra within the FS regime (Fig. 1B). Exchange within the SSS+ and SFZ SD regimes
(Fig. 3C and D) is also similar, and comparable to that in the SS regime of HSQC spectra (Fig. 1C). However, in the

SSS− regime (Fig. 3E) we observe, as predicted above, that the direction of the small chemical shift perturbations in
the indirect dimension is opposite to that of the exchanging state. A comparison of exchange in the FF regime of
the HSQC (Fig. 1D) with the FFF regime of the HMQC (Fig. 1F) shows that the extent of line broadening is more
severe in the HMQC. Close inspection also shows that non-linear chemical shift perturbations, which are often taken
to be a sign of more complex association mechanisms, are observed in early stages of the titration (within the FFZ SD
regime). Lastly, resonances within the SF regime of the HSQC (Fig. 1E) are now within the SSS− regime of the
HMQC (Fig. 3G), close to the calculated coalescence point (Fig. 3A, red lines), and consequently very different
spectra result, with severe line broadening but no chemical shift perturbations observed within the indirect dimension
of the HMQC. In summary therefore, it is clear that more complex exchange phenomena are present within HMQC
spectra, that on a practical level can result in stronger line broadening and altered chemical shift perturbations to
those obtained through HSQC experiments.
Longitudinal relaxation optimised pulse sequences for the measurement of heteronuclear zero
and double quantum correlation spectra
Our analysis above of exchange within HZQC and HDQC spectra has indicated the potential utility of this pair of
complementary experiments for the analysis of molecular interactions. A number of pulse sequences have been
described for the measurement of ZQ and DQ correlation spectra. The first observation of ZQ and DQ transitions
was reported by Müller in 197931 , and magnitude mode experiments were later developed in which separate ZQ
and DQ transitions could be isolated19 . It was also shown that ZQ and DQ transitions could be detected from the
same physical experiment simply by applying different receiver phase cycling during processing, while experimental
sensitivity could be enhanced using Ernst angle excitation19 . The first phase sensitive HZQC and HDQC experiments
were reported by Jarvet and Allard, including gradient selected variants32 , and an alternative sensitivity-enhanced
√
HZQC experiment was later reported by the Kay group for application to methyl groups28 , with only a loss of 2 in
sensitivity relative to the HMQC (and less when the improved relaxation of methyl ZQ coherences is taken into
account).
Here we present further refinements of the sensitivity-enhanced HZQC experiment28 . We have introduced
longitudinal relaxation optimisation, applying the same principles as used for the SOFAST-HMQC experiment33 .
As established previously for the SOFAST-HMQC experiment, selective Ernst angle excitation of amide protons
(or equally methyl protons if applied to a 1 H,13 C correlation experiment) is expected here also to provide a large
sensitivity gain through efficient longitudinal cross-relaxation with the surrounding bath of unexcited spins and by
avoiding saturation of the solvent, allowing rapid repetition rates. Alternatively, where sensitivity is not limiting, this
enables rapid acquisition of the experiment.
The pulse sequence and coherence transfer pathways for the HZQC and HDQC experiments are shown in
Fig. 4A. 1 H +1 and −1 coherence orders are selected during t1 depending on the position of the 180◦ refocusing
pulse indicated by dashed lines. Selection of ∆pS = +1 or −1 is then required at the first 90◦ pulse on the S spin to
isolate ZQ and DQ coherences. However, by storing individual steps of the phase cycle on this pulse and applying
the required receiver phase during processing, both HZQC and HDQC experiments can be acquired simultaneously.
√
Using the sensitivity enhanced approach, each of these spectra will have a factor of only 2 less sensitivity than
original HMQC. Moreover, by shearing both ZQ and DQ spectra and then summing, a conventional correlation
spectrum can in principle be obtained with identical sensitivity to the original HMQC (Fig. 4B).
We have validated our new experiment, which we term the SOFAST-H(Z/D)QC, by comparison with 1 H,15 N
SOFAST-HMQC measurements of the folded protein ubiquitin, and the unfolded Y719E variant of the FLN5 filamin
domain36, 37 . Analysis of the integrated amide signal intensity as a function of the inter-scan delay showed that for
both samples the sensitivity of SOFAST-HZQC and SOFAST-HDQC experiments was very close to the expected
√
factor of 2 less than the SOFAST-HMQC (Fig. 4C,D). Very similar intensities were observed in the first increments

Figure 4. The SOFAST-H(Z/D)QC experiment. (A) Pulse sequence and coherence transfer pathways for the
SOFAST-H(Z/D)QC experiment. Two experiments are recorded for each point in t1 , in which the 180◦ pulse
indicated with dashed lines is placed at positions A and B. The delay δ is 1/(2J) = 5.5 ms. The filled shaped pulse
is a 120◦ Pc9 pulse (2657 µs at 8.2 ppm, 700 MHz). The hollow pulses A and B are 180◦ Reburp pulses (1935 µs at
8.2 ppm, 700 MHz). Phase cycling of φ1 is x, −x and the receiver phase φrx is x, −x. The phase of φ1 is incremented
by 90◦ after each pair of experiments A and B, resulting in four FIDs labelled Ax , Ay , Bx and By . Cosine and sine
modulated components of ZQ and DQ spectra are formed from combinations of these FIDs:
ZQcos = Ax + iAy + Bx − iBy , ZQsin = iAx − Ay − iBx − By , DQcos = Ax − iAy + Bx + iBy , and
DQsin = −iAx − Ay + iBx − By . Note that spin dynamical phases are listed here, which when implemented may need
to be adapted according to the spectrometer manufacturer34, 35 . (B) Reconstruction of single-quantum-like

of the SOFAST-HZQC and SOFAST-HDQC experiments and therefore only a single trace is shown in Fig. 4C,D.
Comparison with an equivalent H(Z/D)QC experiment in which selective pulses in Fig. 4A were replaced with
hard pulses shows that, as previously observed for the SOFAST-HMQC33 , a substantial increase in sensitivity (or
equivalently, a reduction in acquisition time) is obtained through the optimisation of longitudinal relaxation. This
effect is particularly large in the case of the unfolded protein FLN5 Y719E (Fig. 4D), indicating the importance
of avoiding saturation of solvent protons. Lastly, as expected, we find that the sensitivity of the combined ZQ
and DQ experiments (Fig. 4B), which we term the SOFAST-H(Z+D)QC, is only marginally less than the original
SOFAST-HMQC experiment (Fig. 4C,D).
SOFAST-HMQC, HZQC and HDQC spectra of ubiquitin are presented in Fig. 4E,G,I. Note that because 15 N has
a negative gyromagnetic ratio, the zero quantum frequency corresponds to the sum of the chemical shifts, δN + δH ,
while the double quantum frequency corresponds to the difference in chemical shifts, δN − δH . A larger spectral
width was used to acquire these HZQC and HDQC experiments, but in practice this could be avoided as folded
signals are unlikely to overlap with other resonances. As expected, HZQC and HDQC resonances are well resolved,
with symmetric lineshapes. The sheared and reconstructed SOFAST-H(Z+D)QC spectrum (Fig. 4B) is also shown in
red in Fig. 4E. This overlays closely with the SOFAST-HMQC spectrum, with comparable intensity. However, due
to the shearing transform of the original Lorentzian tails in the direct dimensions of the ZQ and DQ spectra, the
reconstructed cross-peaks have a discernible ‘X’ shape, with a slightly narrower linewidth on-resonance.
Similar spectra of the unfolded protein FLN5 Y719E are presented in Fig. 4F,H,J. In this case, due to the slower
transverse relaxation associated with the more flexible polypeptide chain, the 3 JHNHA scalar coupling has a significant
contribution to resonance linewidths in the direct dimension of the HMQC (Fig. 4F). Due to the amide selective
refocusing pulse in the SOFAST-HMQC, this coupling is refocused during t1 . However, in the SOFAST-HZQC and
HDQC experiments the use of the selective pulse gives rise to an E.COSY effect38 that results in an undesirable
diagonal appearance of resonances. This effect could be alleviated by deuteration of the protein at the Hα position.
Indeed, this has previously been reported to greatly increase the resolution and sensitivity of more conventional
HSQC and HMQC measurements of intrinsically disordered proteins39 .
Experimental application to Hsp90 ligand binding
Having developed a theoretical understanding of the effects of chemical exchange on HSQC, HMQC, HZQC and
HDQC experiments, and developed new sensitivity optimised pulse sequences for the measurement of HZQC and
HDQC spectra, we sought to demonstrate their application to the analysis of a well-characterised protein–ligand
interaction. For this, we selected the interaction of the 25 kDa N-terminal domain (NTD) of human Hsp90 (Fig. 5B)
with the small molecule 1 (Fig. 5A), previously identified in a fragment screen40 and with a Kd of 42 µM previously
determined using surface plasmon resonance41 . An NMR titration was carried out using 70 µM uniformly 1 H,15 Nlabelled Hsp90 NTD, and a series of fifteen HSQC, SOFAST-HMQC and SOFAST-H(Z/D)QC spectra were acquired
at ligand concentrations from 0 to 800 µM (Fig. 5C).
The resulting spectra illustrate experimentally the differences between the HSQC, HMQC, HZQC and HDQC
experiments predicted above. This is particularly clear in the case of residue D93, which is depicted in Fig. 5C. This
resonance has frequency differences ∆ωI = 530 s−1 and ∆ωS = 200 s−1 between the free and bound states, relative
to a fitted dissociation rate (see below) of 787 ± 19 s−1 . All coherences for this residue are therefore formally in fast
exchange regimes, but subject to varying amounts of exchange broadening (at the mid-point, ξI = 0.34, ξS = 0.13,
ξZQ = 0.46 and ξDQ = −0.21). Both HSQC and HDQC spectra show strong cross-peaks for this residue at all points
in the titration, but in the HMQC and HZQC experiments exchange broadening is more severe.
Such variations in the appearance of a single residue across multiple experiments may be a useful tool to provide
independent probes of chemical exchange, that will ultimately provide improved confidence in parameters such
as dissociation rates that are obtained from analysis of titration data. To explore this, we performed independent

alongside with identical contour levels. Arrows indicate the fitted positions of free and bound resonances.

two-dimensional lineshape analyses of each set of spectra, carrying out global fits of multiple residues exhibiting a
range of exchange behaviours (Fig. 5C and S2–5). Uncertainties in the fitted parameters were evaluated using both
the previously described block bootstrap resampling algorithm8 , and jackknife resampling of spins or overlapping
groups of spins (see Methods) (Table 2). Similar estimates of the dissociation constant and dissociation rate were
obtained from all four sets of spectra. However, given the variation between individual fits, the bootstrap method
appears to have underestimated the uncertainty in these parameters. The reason for this is not clear at present.
Nevertheless, using the larger error estimates determined by the jackknife approach, consistent parameter estimates
were obtained across all sets of measurements. The jackknife method has been implemented in v1.6 of TITAN and
on the basis of these observations, we recommend that users perform error estimates using both approaches and
choose the most conservative result. The combined dissociation constant determined from these measurements,
51.1 ± 1.3 µM, was slightly greater than the value of 42 µM previously reported using SPR measurements41 . This
may reflect the effects of attachment to the surface or the biosensor, or the slightly lower ionic strength of the buffer
used for SPR (50 mM Tris-based saline, pH 7.6, versus 50 mM sodium phosphate, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.5).
Longitudinal and transverse relaxation optimised HZQC and HDQC pulse sequences
The SOFAST-H(Z/D)QC pulse sequence described above (Fig. 4A) is suitable for observations of amide resonances
in intrinsically disordered proteins or folded domains with relatively low molecular weights (e.g. the 25 kDa Hsp90
NTD, Fig. 5). Perdeuteration will improve the accessible range of molecular weights further, but such systems are
then most effectively observed using transverse relaxation optimised experiments, such as amide or methyl TROSY
experiments. The amide SOFAST-H(Z/D)QC experiment (Fig. 4A) may be readily adapted and applied to methyl
spin systems, in an analogous manner to the methyl-SOFAST-HMQC experiment44 . The HZQC has already been
reported to have more favourable relaxation properties than the ‘methyl-TROSY’ HMQC experiment28 , and using

the sequence described here an additional HDQC spectrum may be acquired at no cost. Additional variants have
been reported incorporating filters for the fast-relaxing outer lines45 , or in which heteronuclear polarisation may
be used to enhance the sensitivity of HZQC experiments further46 . However, two-dimensional lineshape analysis
of spectra obtained using these more complex pulse sequences is not currently implemented in TITAN, and we
therefore recommend the SOFAST-H(Z/D)QC sequence described above (Fig. 4A).
The case of amide spin systems is more complex. The TROSY experiment, in which the H β N ± transition is
correlated with the H − N β transition, has the most favourable transverse relaxation properties27 . However, multiple
quantum coherences also have a TROSY effect due to the absence of intra-system dipolar relaxation, and due to
destructive CSA–CSA interference, ZQ coherences have particularly favourable relaxation properties. However, due
to presence of transverse proton magnetisation, the relaxation of both ZQ and DQ coherences by external spins is
more severe than for the H β N ± TROSY transition26, 27 .
A sensitivity-enhanced ZQ-TROSY experiment has previously been described27 . Here we present an updated
BEST-ZQ-TROSY experiment that incorporates longitudinal relaxation optimisation using selective excitation of
amide resonances (Fig. 6). In contrast to the SOFAST-H(Z/D)QC, it is not possible to acquire both ZQ and DQ
experiments simultaneously, but a BEST-DQ-TROSY experiment may be acquired separately by modification of the
pulse phases as described in the figure legend.
We have tested this new sequence experimentally with observations of 2 H,15 N-labelled ubiquitin in H2 O at
277 K, 950 MHz (Fig. 7). While the rotational correlation time is still relatively low, ca. 9 ns, this nevertheless
provides validation of the pulse sequence and points towards applications to higher molecular weight systems.
Fig. 7A–D presents a comparison of BEST-TROSY47 , BEST-HSQC48 , BEST-ZQ-TROSY and BEST-DQ-TROSY
experiments, which were all acquired with identical acquisition times and parameters. Folded resonances can be
observed in both ZQ and DQ experiments (magenta contours), but it is clear that this does not introduce additional
resonance overlap. Cross-sections through the representative E64 resonance are shown in Fig. 7E–H, and these
were fitted to Lorentzian lineshapes to determine the indicated linewidths. As expected, TROSY, ZQ-TROSY and
DQ-TROSY experiments all had reduced linewidths in the direct dimension relative to the HSQC. In the indirect
dimension, the ZQ resonance was marginally sharper than the HSQC resonance, and approximately 1.6 times broader
than the TROSY, while the DQ resonance was substantially more broad (2.6 times that of the TROSY). However,
the intensities of the TROSY and ZQ-TROSY resonances were comparable, and significantly higher than in both
HSQC and DQ-TROSY spectra. Thus, we believe the BEST-ZQ-TROSY experiment may be a useful and reasonably
sensitive experiment for applications in high molecular weight systems. Importantly, because coherence transfer in
this experiment is much simpler than in the regular TROSY experiment (in which the back-transfer H β N ± → H − N β

shaped pulse is a 90◦ Pc9 pulse (1958 µs at 8.2 ppm, 950 MHz) while the hollow pulses are 180◦ Reburp pulses
(1432 µs at 8.2 ppm, 950 MHz). The delay δ is 1/(4J) = 2.7 ms, φ3 is −y, φ4 is cycled x4 , y4 , (−x)4 , (−y)4 and the
receiver phase is cycled x, −x, −y, y, −x, x, y, −y. Gradients are applied as 1 ms trapezoidal pulses, g1 = 11% and
g2 = 7%. Frequency discrimination is achieved by the echo/anti-echo method. The echo (dashed CTP) is acquired
with the dashed pulse at ‘A’, φ1 −x, x, −y, y and φ2 −y, y, −x, x, and the anti-echo (solid CTP) is acquired with the
dashed pulse at ‘B’, φ1 −x, x, y, −y and φ2 −y, y, x, −x. Alternatively, the BEST-DQ-TROSY experiment may be
acquired by setting φ3 to y. The DQ echo is acquired with the dashed pulse at ‘A’, φ1 −x, x, −y, y and φ2 −y, y, x, −x,
and the DQ anti-echo is acquired with the dashed pulse at ‘B’, φ1 −x, x, y, −y and φ2 −y, y, −x, x. Note that spin

two-dimensional lineshape analysis.

Discussion
In this paper we have presented a systematic analysis of chemical exchange regimes within two-dimensional
correlation spectra, focusing in particular on differences between SQ, MQ, ZQ and DQ-based experiments. In
many ways, these results are not new. We have previously commented upon the differences in exchange behaviour
between HSQC and HMQC experiments8 , and indeed the use of ZQ and DQ TROSY experiments to reduce chemical
exchange-induced resonance broadening has also been suggested previously29 . Differences in ZQ and DQ relaxation
rates have been proposed and exploited as a simple way to identify and characterise chemical exchange49–52 , and
comparisons between chemical shift perturbations in HSQC and HMQC experiments have been used to determine
the signs of chemical shift differences in relaxation dispersion measurements30 . Indeed, joint analysis of (exchangeinduced) relaxation dispersion of SQ, MQ, ZQ and DQ coherences has been a powerful tool for the analysis of
sparsely populated intermediates53–55 . However, we believe that this is the first time that these results have been
set out comprehensively, and in particular that the impact on chemical exchange regimes across NMR titration
measurements has been fully considered.
A key practical result of our analysis is that HMQC experiments are much more sensitive to chemical exchangeinduced line broadening than their HSQC (and amide TROSY) counterparts. Such sensitivity may be useful in
some circumstances, but in others it may be a hindrance to tracking the movement of resonances across a series of
titration measurements. As an alternative or complement, we have therefore developed the SOFAST-H(Z/D)QC
experiment (Fig. 4A) for the simultaneous and sensitive acquisition of ZQ and DQ correlation spectra. Such spectra
have reduced sensitivity to chemical exchange (Fig. 2) compared to the original HMQC, and this may be particularly
useful in the case of titrations observed using methyl labelling. We have also developed longitudinal relaxation
optimised BEST-ZQ-TROSY and BEST-DQ-TROSY experiments for application to amide spin systems (Fig. 6).

resonance, indicated with red crosshairs in panels A–D, are plotted for (E) BEST-TROSY, (F) BEST-HSQC, (G)
BEST-ZQ-TROSY and (H) BEST-DQ-TROSY spectra. Red lines show fits to Lorentzian lineshapes with linewidths
as indicated.

While transverse relaxation of ZQ coherences is not quite as optimal as in the full TROSY experiment (Fig. 7),
the simpler pulse sequence means that these experiments are amenable to two-dimensional lineshape analysis, in
contrast to standard TROSY experiments.
We have explored the difference between SQ, MQ, ZQ and DQ correlation experiments on experimental titration
measurements by observing the interaction of the Hsp90 NTD with a small molecule ligand (Fig. 5)41 . As expected,
resonances with the HSQC, HMQC, HZQC and HDQC experiments that were acquired exhibited different chemical
exchange behaviours, and the independent two-dimensional lineshape analysis of the four titration series using
TITAN ultimately provided improved confidence in the dissociation constant and dissociation rate determined
(Table 2). As the additional time required to acquire a second correlation spectrum during a titration measurement is
often small relative to the total time required for setup and sample handling, we suggest that this may be a useful
strategy in general: either by acquiring HSQC and HMQC measurements sequentially, or acquiring HZQC and
HDQC experiments simultaneously as described above using the SOFAST-H(Z/D)QC experiment.
An additional virtue of such an approach is that it provides increased sensitivity to departures from simple
two-state association mechanisms. NMR lineshapes are well known to be sensitive probes of more complex
binding mechanisms, such as induced fit or conformational selection8, 56, 57 , and the independent analysis of multiple
experiment series may reduce the chance of overlooking such mechanisms. Equally, where such multi-state
mechanisms have been identified, the analysis of multiple experiments may provide increased confidence in the

fitted parameters. Ultimately, in analogy to analyses of relaxation dispersion measurements53–55 , we envisage the
global analysis of multiple experiment types (or indeed experiments at multiple field strengths), and efforts are
underway to implement this in a future version of TITAN.

Methods
Sample preparation
Hsp90 protein was produced as described previously58 . The N-terminal fragment of Hsp90alpha (residues 9–
236) was overexpressed in the E. Coli strain BL21 (pLysS) grown in EnPresso defined media (SigmaAldrich)
supplemented with 4 g/L 15 N ammonium chloride. The construct included a deca-his tag within a 15 amino acid
N-terminal extension of MGHHHHHHHHHHSSGH, and the protein was purified using a Ni2+ affinity column
followed by a monoQ ion-exchange column.
Compound 1 was identified from a fragment screen against Hsp90 as described previously40 .
NMR spectroscopy
Acquisition and processing All NMR data were acquired using Bruker spectrometers operating with Topspin

3.5. Pulse sequences for the SOFAST-H(Z/D)QC and BEST-ZQ-TROSY experiments are provided in supporting
information. NMR data were processed using nmrPipe59 . SOFAST-H(Z+D)QC spectra were sheared and recombined
in nmrPipe using the shear.M macro. Scripts and additional processing macros for the analysis of the SOFASTH(Z/D)QC experiment are provided in supporting information.
Validation of the SOFAST-H(Z/D)QC experiment NMR experiments were acquired at 700 MHz to validate and

assess the sensitivity of the SOFAST-H(Z/D)QC experiment using a ca. 1 mM sample of 1 H,15 N-labelled ubiquitin
(10% D2 O, 298 K) and a 350 µM sample of 1 H,15 N-labelled FLN5 Y719E (10% D2 O, 283 K). SOFAST-HMQC
experiments33 were acquired using the same shaped pulses as specified for the SOFAST-H(Z/D)QC (Fig. 4A) while
control measurements were recorded replacing shaped pulses with corresponding hard pulses. Sensitivity was
assessed from the integrated amide intensity in the first increment of experiments recorded with a constant number
of scans and a 50 ms acquisition time, and recycle delays varied from 50 ms to 2 s. Measurements were normalised
for the total acquisition time (excluding dummy scans). 2D correlation spectra were acquired with a 100 ms recycle
delay, a 100 ms acquisition time (1024 complex points) in the direct dimension and a 100 ms acquisition time (512
complex points) in the indirect dimension.
Hsp90 titration measurements A 70 µM sample of 1 H,15 N-labelled human Hsp90 N-terminal domain (50 mM

sodium phosphate, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.5, 10% D2 O) was titrated with a 20 mM stock of ligand 1 (Fig. 5A) in
d6 -DMSO. 15 points were recorded, up to a maximum ligand concentation of 810 µM. NMR experiments were
acquired at 298 K, 950 MHz, with a 100 ms acquisition time (1536 complex points) in the direct dimension and a
21 ms acquisition time (64 complex points) in indirect dimensions. SOFAST-HMQC33 and SOFAST-H(Z/D)QC
experiments were acquired with a recycle delay of 300 ms, and FHSQC experiments60 were acquired with a 1 s
recycle delay.
BEST-ZQ-TROSY and BEST-DQ-TROSY experiments NMR experiments were acquired at 950 MHz to validate

and assess the sensitivity of the BEST-ZQ-TROSY and BEST-DQ-TROSY experiments using a ca. 1 mM sample of
2 H,15 N-labelled ubiquitin (10% D O, 277 K). BEST-TROSY spectra47 were acquired using the b_trosyf3gpph.2
2
library pulse sequence. Spectra were acquired with a 100 ms recycle delay, a 100 ms acquisition time (1536 complex
points) in the direct dimension and an 83 ms acquisition time (256 complex points) in the indirect dimension.

Lineshape analysis
Two-dimensional lineshape fitting, and simulations of HSQC, HMQC, HZQC and HDQC spectra, were carried
out using TITAN (v1.6)8 . HZQC and HDQC experiments have been implemented by a simple modification of the
original HMQC implementation8 to isolate the subspace of ZQ or DQ coherences. Fitting of the Hsp90 titration data
was carried out in two stages. The chemical shifts and linewidths of the unbound state were initially fitted using only
the first spectrum, acquired in the absence of ligand. These parameters were then fixed, and the chemical shifts and
linewidths of the bound state were fitted together with the dissociation constant and the dissociation rate. Bootstrap
error estimates were calculated using 100 replicas. A second estimate of uncertainty in the dissociation constant
and dissociation rate was also determined using a jackknife algorithm, in which fitting was repeated multiple times,
with each spin system being omitted in turn. The reported uncertainties from this method are the standard deviation
across all fits. The jackknife algorithm has been implemented in the v1.6 release of TITAN.
