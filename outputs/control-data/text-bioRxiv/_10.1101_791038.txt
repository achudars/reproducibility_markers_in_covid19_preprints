Abstract

28
29

Influenza B virus undergoes seasonal antigenic drift more slowly than influenza A, but the

30

reasons for this difference are unclear. While the evolutionary dynamics of influenza viruses

31

play out globally, they are fundamentally driven by mutation, reassortment, drift, and selection

32

within individual hosts. These processes have recently been described for influenza A virus, but

33

little is known about the evolutionary dynamics of influenza B virus (IBV) at the level of individual

34

infections and transmission events. Here we define the within-host evolutionary dynamics of

35

influenza B virus by sequencing virus populations from naturally-infected individuals enrolled in

36

a prospective, community-based cohort over 8176 person-seasons of observation. Through

37

analysis of high depth-of-coverage sequencing data from samples from 91 individuals with

38

influenza B, we find that influenza B virus accumulates lower genetic diversity than previously

39

observed for influenza A virus during acute infections. Consistent with studies of influenza A

40

viruses, the within-host evolution of influenza B viruses is characterized by purifying selection

41

and the general absence of widespread positive selection of within-host variants. Analysis of

42

shared genetic diversity across 15 sequence-validated transmission pairs suggests that IBV

43

experiences a tight transmission bottleneck similar to that of influenza A virus. These patterns of

44

local-scale evolution are consistent with influenza B virus’ slower global evolutionary rate.

The evolution of influenza virus is a significant public health problem and necessitates the

annual evaluation of influenza vaccine formulation to keep pace with viral escape from herd

immunity. Influenza B virus is a serious health concern for children, in particular, yet remains

understudied compared to influenza A virus. Influenza B virus evolves more slowly than

52

influenza A, but the factors underlying this are not completely understood. We studied how the

within-host diversity of influenza B virus relates to its global evolution by sequencing viruses

54

from a community-based cohort. We found that influenza B virus populations have lower within-

55

host genetic diversity than influenza A virus and experience a tight genetic bottleneck during

transmission. Our work provides insights into the varying dynamics of influenza viruses in

Introduction

60
61

Influenza viruses rapidly mutate and evolve through selection, genetic drift, and reassortment

62

(1). At a global scale, influenza A virus (IAV) and influenza B virus (IBV) evolve under strong

63

positive selection driven by pressure for escape from pre-existing population immunity (2,3).

64

Selection of new antigenic variants contributes to reduced effectiveness of seasonal influenza

65

vaccines, necessitating annual updates of vaccine strains (4). IAV and IBV both undergo

66

seasonal antigenic drift and share a similar genomic architecture, but their ecology and

67

evolution differ in important ways (5). While IBV accounts for roughly one-third of influenza’s

68

burden of morbidity and mortality (6,7), it circulates only in humans and is considered to be a

69

lower pandemic risk than influenza A (IAV) due to the lack of an animal reservoir. Like IAV,

70

there are co-circulating, antigenically-distinct lineages of IBV that are included in the

71

quadrivalent influenza vaccine. Two lineages of IBV diverged in the 1980s, B/Victoria/2/87-like

72

and B/Yamagata/16/88-like, here referred to as B/Victoria and B/Yamagata, respectively (8).

73
74

IBV evolves more slowly than IAV on a global scale and has a lower rate of antigenic drift, but

75

the reasons for this are poorly understood (5,9). Similar evolutionary forces are involved in the

76

antigenic evolution of both IAV and IBV, generally characterized by non-synonymous

77

substitutions at antigenic sites in the surface hemagglutinin (HA) protein (10,11) and

78

reassortment within and between lineages (12–14). The IBV polymerase has a lower mutation

79

rate relative to IAV (15). However, it is unclear whether the slower global evolution of IBV is

80

driven by its lower mutation rate or other differences in selection at the global scale.

81
82

All new seasonal influenza variants are ultimately derived from de novo mutations within

83

individual hosts (16). Therefore, understanding how new variants arise within individuals and

84

transmit between them is essential to defining how novel viruses spread in host populations. For

85

example, if the relative mutation rate is a major factor underlying the global evolutionary

86

differences across IAV and IBV, we might also expect to see differences in their within-host

87

dynamics. We and others have used next-generation sequencing to investigate the within- and

88

between-host evolutionary dynamics of IAV in humans (16–21). We have found that there is

89

little accumulation of intrahost variants during acute infections of immunocompetent individuals

90

(18,19), and we have not found evidence of changes in intrahost diversity by vaccination status

91

or other proxies for immunological history (19,20,22). The IAV transmission bottleneck is

92

stringent (19), which generally means that few variants that arise within hosts are able to

93

transmit. Together, these studies suggest that selection of novel variants is an inefficient

94

process in IAV-infected hosts, contrasting with its patterns of significant positive selection at the

95

global level. Despite the importance of intrahost processes to influenza virus evolution, these

96

dynamics have not been systematically investigated in IBV.

97
98

Here we use next-generation sequencing to define the within-host diversity of IBV populations

99

from individuals enrolled in the Household Influenza Vaccine Evaluation (HIVE) study, a

100

community-based household cohort initiated in 2010. We apply a previously-validated

101

bioinformatic pipeline (23) to identify intrahost single-nucleotide variants (iSNV) arising during

102

infection with B/Victoria and B/Yamagata viruses. We find that IBV has significantly lower

103

intrahost diversity than IAV, consistent with its lower mutation rate and slower rate of evolution.

104

We analyze shared iSNV across 15 genetically-validated household transmission pairs and find

105

that, like IAV, IBV is also subject to a tight genetic bottleneck at transmission. These data

106

provide the first systematic evaluation of the genetic architecture of IBV populations during

107

natural human infection and provide insights into the comparative epidemiology and evolution of

108

influenza viruses.

Results

111
112

We used high depth-of-coverage sequencing to define the intrahost genetic diversity in IBV-

113

positive samples collected from individuals in the HIVE, a prospective, household cohort in

114

southeastern Michigan that follows 200-350 households annually (Table 1). This cohort provides

115

an opportunity to investigate natural infections and transmission events in a community context.

116

Individuals that meet symptom-based criteria for an upper respiratory illness during the

117

surveillance period undergo collection of nasal and throat swabs for molecular detection of

118

respiratory viruses by RT-PCR. Starting in 2014-2015, individuals also provided a sample

119

collected at home prior to subsequent collection of a second specimen at the on-site clinic.

120
121

Over seven seasons (2010-2011 through 2016-2017) and 8176 person-seasons of observation,

122

we identified 111 individuals infected with B/Yamagata and 67 infected with B/Victoria (Table 1).

123

Several households had clusters of infections of two or three IBV-positive individuals within 7

124

days of each other, suggestive of within-household transmission. Because variant identification

125

is sensitive to input viral titer (23), we first measured viral loads of all available IBV-positive

126

samples by RT-qPCR (Figure 1A). Any samples with a viral load below 103 copies/μL were not

127

submitted for sequencing. For samples with a viral load in the range of 103-105 copies/μL, we

128

performed two independent RT-PCR reactions and sequenced replicate libraries on separate

129

sequencing runs. We sequenced samples with viral loads above 105 copies/μL of transport

media in a single replicate. From the available IBV-positive samples, we were able to obtain

131

sequence data on 106 samples from 91 individuals, consisting of 35 individuals infected with

132

B/Victoria and 56 infected with B/Yamagata (Table 1).

133
134

We identified intrahost single nucleotide variants (iSNV) using our previously-validated

135

bioinformatic pipeline. As in our previous work, we report iSNV at frequencies of 2% or above,

136

for which we have well-defined sensitivity and specificity (19). We consider sites with >98%

137

frequency to be essentially fixed, setting the frequency at those sites to 100% (see Materials

138

and Methods). We achieved a mean coverage of 10,000x per sample across most genome

139

segments, with generally lower coverage on segments encoding NP and NS (Figure 1B). We

140

restricted our analysis of iSNV to samples with an average genome coverage of greater than

141

1000x, which includes 99 of the original 106 sequenced samples.

142
143

Within-host genetic diversity of IBV in natural infections

144
145

All samples exhibited low genetic diversity. The vast majority had no iSNV above the 2% cutoff.

146

Of the 99 samples with high-quality NGS data, 70 had no minority iSNV, 17 had one iSNV, 7

147

had two iSNV, and 3 samples had 3 iSNV (median 0, IQR 0-2; Table 2). Two outliers had a

148

large number of iSNV, with 8 and 20 iSNV. These two samples came from the same individual,

149

with one collected at home and the second at the study clinic. Most of the iSNV in these two

150

samples were present at similar frequencies, 3-5% and 17-23% in each specimen, respectively

151

(Table 3), both of which were sequenced in duplicate on separate Illumina runs. The high

152

number of mutations present at similar frequencies is suggestive of a mixed infection with

153

distinct haplotypes or strains as opposed to de novo mutations arising on a single genetic

154

background. The iSNV in the home-collected sample are all found in the subsequent clinic-

155

collected sample, each with a similar change in frequency across the two samples. This further

156

supports the conclusion that these mutations are on the same genome in a mixed infection with

157

two distinct strains.

158
159

We examined how within-host diversity changes by day of sampling during IBV infections, as

160

the virus population rapidly expands and contracts. As we have previously shown that specimen

161

viral load can affect the sensitivity and specificity of variant identification (23), we sought to

162

control for this variable in our analysis. Although viral load generally decreased with time after

163

symptom onset (Figure 1A), we found that within-host diversity as measured by number of

164

identified minority iSNV did not vary with viral load (Figure 2A) or with day of infection (Figure

165

2B). The frequencies of the identified iSNV were consistent across replicate libraries from the

166

same samples, indicating that our measurements of iSNV frequency are precise (Figure 2C).

167
168

We detected minority iSNV across all eight genome segments (Figure 3). We identified more

169

synonymous than nonsynonymous mutations, which given the ratio of synonymous and

170

nonsynonymous sites indicates that purifying selection dominates within hosts. There was only

171

one minority iSNV present in more than one individual; we identified a variant encoding a

172

synonymous mutation in PB1 in two individuals from separate households infected with

173

B/Yamagata in the 2016-2017 season. We did not identify any nonsynonymous minority iSNV in

174

the known antigenic sites of IBV hemagglutinin, which suggests that positive selective pressure

175

for variants that escape antibody-mediated immunity is not particularly strong within hosts. We

176

found that there is no difference in the distribution of the number of iSNV per sample between

177

vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals (Figure 4A). During the first few seasons of the

178

study, some individuals received trivalent vaccines, which contain only one of the two IBV

179

lineages. We therefore repeated this analysis, excluding 3 individuals for whom we had no

180

information about specific vaccine product and re-classifying 6 individuals who received trivalent

181

vaccines and were infected with a lineage not included in that season’s trivalent formulation as

182

“unvaccinated.” We again found no difference in the number of iSNV between groups (MWU

183

test, p = 0.9103). Together, these data indicate that vaccine-induced immunity is not a major

184

diversifying force for IBV within hosts in our study population. This is consistent with our

185

previous work on IAV in the HIVE as well as a randomized-controlled trial of vaccine efficacy

186

(FLU-VACS), both of which showed no difference in intrahost diversity based on same-season

187

vaccination status (19,20). Intrahost diversity was similar between B/Victoria and B/Yamagata

188

virus populations (Figure 4B), consistent with our previous comparison of subtype A/H3N2 and

189

A/H1N1 viruses (19).

190
191

We compared the within-host genetic diversity of IBV to our previously published data on IAV

192

from the HIVE cohort (19). Here, IBV exhibits lower within-host diversity compared to IAV

193

(Figure 4C). To ensure our results were not an artifact of overly stringent quality thresholds, we

194

also identified minority iSNV with less conservative read mapping quality (MapQ) and base

195

quality (Phred) scores. We identified the same set of minority iSNV with a MapQ cut-off of 20 as

196

with the original cutoff of 30. Similarly, reduction of the Phred base-quality cutoff to >25 in

197

addition to a MapQ score cutoff of >20 resulted in only 20 more minority iSNV, eight of which

198

were found in the individual with a mixed infection. The other additional 12 minority iSNV were

199

dispersed across specimens and did not significantly change the overall distribution of within-

200

host diversity. We also examined whether our results were biased by use of a single

201

B/Yamagata and B/Victoria reference for alignment and variant calling, which were both drawn

202

from the 2012-2013 season (see Materials and Methods). We realigned sequence data from 43

203

of the original 99 samples to season-specific reference genomes isolated in southeastern

204

Michigan. We found that the overall alignment rate for any given specimen was similar between

205

the original reference and the new season-matched reference. Variant identification based on

206

the new references and the original quality thresholds resulted in the same distribution of within-

207

host diversity, although the identity of some iSNV was different (Figure 4D).

208
209

Together, these results indicate that our measurements of within-host diversity are robust to

210

several technical aspects of variant identification and are unlikely to account for the lower

211

observed diversity of IBV. Because these data are from the same cohort and were generated

212

using the same sequencing approach and analytic pipeline as our previous IAV datasets, the

213

observed differences likely reflect true biological differences between IAV and IBV.

214
215

Identification of household transmission pairs

216
217

We compared viral diversity across samples from individuals in the same household to

218

investigate the genetic bottleneck that influenza B viruses experience during natural

219

transmission. Over the seven influenza seasons, thirty-nine households in the HIVE cohort had

220

two or more individuals positive for the same IBV lineage within a 7-day interval (Table 1). This

221

epidemiologic linkage is suggestive of transmission events but does not rule out co-incident

222

community acquired infection (19). We identified 16 putative transmission pairs for which we

223

sequenced at least one sample from each individual. In one of these pairs, the putative recipient

224

was the individual with a mixed infection. The donor did not have evidence of a mixed infection

225

based on number of iSNV, which would imply that the recipient may have been infected twice or

226

that the second virus was lost from the donor by the time of sampling. This pair was excluded

227

from the between-host analysis, leaving 15 putative transmission pairs for which we have high-

228

quality sequencing data on both donor and recipient influenza populations.

229
230

We used our sequencing data to determine which of these epidemiologically linked household

231

pairs were actual IBV transmission pairs. We generated maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees

232

for samples from the two IBV lineages using the concatenated coding consensus sequences.

233

Phylogenetic analysis provided genetic evidence that the 15 epidemiologically-linked pairs were

234

indeed true transmission pairs, as epidemiologically-linked pairs were found nearest each other

235

in each tree (Figure 5A and 5B; vertical bars with household ID). We also validated these

236

transmission pairs by analyzing the genetic distance across viral populations. True transmission

237

pairs should have genetically similar populations exhibiting low genetic distance, while

238

individuals with coincident community acquisition are more likely to have populations with a

239

higher genetic distance. We compared the genetic distance between epidemiologically-linked

240

household pairs and random community pairs from the same season and infected with the

241

same IBV lineage, using L1-norm as measurement of genetic distance (Figure 5C). The

242

distribution of random community pairs functions as a null model of genetic distances among

243

locally circulating strains. All of the 15 putative transmission pairs fell on the tail of this

244

distribution, below the 5th percentile of the community pair L1-norm distribution, indicating that

245

they are true transmission pairs (Figure 5C). While the L1-norm is a function of both the

246

consensus sequence and the iSNV, this signal was predominantly driven by consensus

247

differences, as reflected in the phylogenetic analysis.

248
249

Comparison of viral diversity across transmission pairs

250
251

Transmission bottlenecks restrict the genetic diversity that is passed between hosts. With a

252

loose transmission bottleneck, many unique genomes will be passed from donor to recipient.

253

Because this will allow two variants at a given site to be transmitted, sites that are polymorphic

254

in the donor are more likely to be polymorphic in the recipient. However, in the case of a tight or

255

stringent bottleneck, sites that are polymorphic in the donor will likely be either fixed or absent in

256

the recipient. We have previously demonstrated that influenza A experiences a tight

257

transmission bottleneck of 1-2 unique genomes (19). Across our 15 IBV transmission pairs, we

258

found no sites that were polymorphic in the donor and recipient (Figure 6). Intrahost SNV

259

present in the donor were either fixed (100%) or absent (0%) in the recipient. These data

260

suggest a stringent transmission bottleneck for influenza B, similar to that of influenza A. As

261

there were fewer samples, transmission pairs, and iSNV in our IBV dataset, we were unable to

262

obtain a robust and precise estimate of bottleneck size.

263
264

Discussion

265
266

Here we define the within-host genetic diversity of IBV in natural infections by sequencing 106

267

samples collected over 8176 person-seasons of observation in a household cohort. Because

268

the HIVE study prospectively identifies individuals with acute respiratory illness regardless of

269

severity, these samples capture IBV dynamics in a natural setting, reflective of infections

270

occurring in the community. We show that within-host diversity of IBV is remarkably low, with

271

most samples displaying no intrahost variants above our level of detection. We also find that

272

IBV experiences a tight transmission bottleneck, limiting the diversity that is passed between

273

hosts. IBV exhibits significantly lower within-host diversity compared to IAV. These findings

274

reflect the slower relative evolutionary rate of IBV compared to IAV.

275
276

Our findings are largely consistent with what has been observed in IAV infections in humans

277

(17–20). We found that only a minority of samples contain iSNV, the majority of which encode

278

synonymous changes, consistent with a predominance of purifying selection within hosts. If

279

immune-driven selective pressures were sufficiently strong to drive positive selection of

280

antigenic variants at the individual level, we would expect to see enrichment of variants in

281

antigenic regions. However, variants were no more common in the antigenic proteins,

282

hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, and we found no intrahost variants in known antigenic

283

regions of hemagglutinin. We also found that the extent of within-host diversity did not vary with

284

current-season vaccination status, further suggesting that immune selection is not particularly

285

strong within hosts (19,20,22). Our data suggest that selective sweeps occur infrequently at the

286

individual level, with selection only evident over a broader scale of time and space (19,35). We

287

recognize, however, that it is possible for individual level selective pressure to vary in magnitude

288

by age, locale, influenza infection history, or immune status (36).

289
290

We do find that there are important differences in the within-host evolution of IAV and IBV. IBV

291

displays significantly lower within-host diversity compared to IAV. Since measurements of

292

within-host diversity can vary based on host population, sequencing approach, and variant

293

calling algorithm (37), a strength of our study is that our comparison is based on samples from

294

the same cohort with the same sequencing approach and analytic pipeline. In both of our

295

studies, we have sequenced swab samples directly without prior culture, accounted for the

296

confounding effect of viral load, and used a standardized, empirically-validated analytic pipeline

297

for variant identification (23). This pipeline includes rigorous quality criteria to reduce false

298

positives that can be introduced by amplification and Illumina sequencing. Importantly, these

299

empirical quality criteria did not mask diversity actually present in these samples, strengthening

300

the conclusion that IBV exhibits lower within-host diversity compared to IAV.

301
302

The most likely biological explanation for IBV’s lower within-host diversity is its de novo mutation

303

rate, which is thought to be at least two-fold lower than that of IAV (15). Viral mutation rates are

304

critical to the diversification of rapidly evolving viruses within hosts. Under a neutral model, the

305

number and frequency of minority variants is dependent on the mutation rate and demographics

306

of the population (16). In such a model, the expected number of variants is highly sensitive to

307

variation in the mutation rate across the range commonly estimated in RNA viruses. In light of

308

our results, a more thorough comparison of mutation rates across influenza viruses is needed.

309
310

Another possible factor underlying IBV’s reduced diversity is the mutational robustness of the

311

IBV genome relative to IAV. If IBV were less robust to mutation, stronger negative selection on

312

multiple genes in IBV could result in more limited within-host diversity, perhaps located to

313

certain regions of the genome. However, we found that the distributions of iSNV across IAV and

314

IBV genomes are relatively similar. Furthermore, we have previously shown that the distribution

315

of mutational fitness effects in influenza A/WSN/33/H1N1 matches that of other RNA and

316

ssDNA viruses (38). Given that viruses across families with vastly different genomic architecture

317

have similar mutational robustness, this is unlikely to account for the differences in within-host

318

diversity between IAV and IBV.

319
320

We find that IBV experiences a stringent genetic bottleneck between hosts. A stringent

321

transmission bottleneck places a constraint on the rate of adaptation of viral populations within

322

and between individual hosts. Population bottlenecks reduce the effective population size, which

323

increases random genetic drift and decreases the efficiency of selection (39). This results in a

324

reduced ability of selection to fix beneficial mutations and to remove deleterious ones, which

325

can decrease population fitness. However, there are potential evolutionary advantages to

326

stringent bottlenecks, including removal of defective interfering particles (40,41). While we were

327

not able to estimate the size of the transmission bottleneck as precisely as IAV, it is likely that

328

the bottleneck size is comparable across the two viruses given the similarities in their

329

transmission routes and ecology in the human population. Data from many more transmission

330

pairs will be necessary for a more robust estimate.

331
332

Together, our results are consistent with the slower rate of global evolution observed in IBV

333

lineages compared with both seasonal A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 (10,12,14,42). We suggest that a

334

lower intrinsic mutation rate leads to reduced within-host diversity. With a comparably tight

335

bottleneck, fewer de novo variants will rise to a level where they can be transmitted and spread

336

through host populations. Combined with a lower incidence of IBV versus IAV, this would result

337

in fewer variants that eventually spread and influence global dynamics. However, further

types of seasonal influenza viruses and how they contribute to larger-scale evolutionary

Description of the HIVE cohort

345
346

The HIVE study is a prospective, community-based household cohort in Southeastern Michigan

347

based at the University of Michigan School of Public Health (24–29). The cohort was initiated in

348

2010, with enrollment of households with children occurring on an annual basis and an active

349

surveillance period lasting from October through May. In 2014, active surveillance was

350

expanded to take place year-round. Participating adults provided informed consent for

351

themselves and their children, and children ages 7-17 provided oral assent. Individuals in each

352

household were followed prospectively for acute respiratory illness, defined as two or more of

353

the following: cough, fever or feverishness, nasal congestion, chills, headache, body aches, or

354

sore throat. Study participants meeting the criteria for acute respiratory illness attended a study

355

research clinic at the University of Michigan School of Public Health where a combined throat

356

and nasal swab, or a nasal swab only for children less than three years old, was collected by

357

the study team. Beginning in the 2014-2015 season, study participants with acute respiratory

358

illnesses took an additional nasal swab at home at the time of illness onset, collected either by

359

themselves or by a parent. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the

360

University of Michigan Medical School.

364

We processed upper respiratory specimens (combined nasal and throat swab or nasal swab) for

365

confirmation of influenza virus infection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-

366

PCR). We extracted viral RNA with either QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kits (Qiagen) or PureLink Pro

367

96 Viral RNA/DNA Purification kits (Invitrogen) and tested samples using the SuperScript III

368

Platinum One-Step Quantitative RT-PCR System with ROX (Invitrogen) and primers and probes

369

for universal detection of influenza A and B (CDC protocol, 28 April 2009). Specimens positive

370

for influenza virus were tested using subtype/lineage primer and probe sets, which are designed

371

to detect influenza A (H3N2), A (H1N1)pdm09, B (Yamagata), and B (Victoria). An RNAseP

372

primer/probe set was run for each specimen to confirm specimen quality and successful RNA

373

extraction.

374
375

We quantified the viral load in each sample by RT-qPCR using primers specific for the open

376

reading frame of segment 8 (NS1/NEP): forward primer 5’-TCCTCAACTCACTCTTCGAGCG-3’,

377

reverse primer 5’-CGGTGCTCTTGACCAAATTGG-3’, and probe 5’-(FAM)-

378

CCAATTCGAGCAGCTGAAACTGCGGTG-(BHQ1)-3’. Each reaction contained 5.4 μL of

379

nuclease-free water, 0.5 μL of each primer at 50 μM, 0.1 μL of ROX dye, 0.5 μL SuperScript III

380

RT/Platinum Taq enzyme mix, 0.5 μL of 10 μM probe, 12.5 μL of 2x PCR buffer master mix, and

381

5 μL of extracted viral RNA. To relate genome copy number to Ct value, we used a standard

curve based on serial dilutions of a plasmid control, run in duplicate on the same plate.

391

Uni3R, B-NS-Uni3F, and B-NS-Uni3R (sequences and proportions are listed in ref. (30)). The

392

thermocycler protocol was: 45 ˚C for 60 min, 55 ˚C for 30 min, 94 ˚C for 2 min, then 5 cycles of

393

94 ˚C for 20 s, 40 ˚C for 30 s, 68 ˚C for 3 min 30 s, then 40 cycles of 94 ˚C for 20 s, 58 ˚C for 30

394

s, 68 ˚C for 3 min 30 s, and a final extension of 68 ˚C for 10 min. We confirmed IBV genome

395

amplification by gel electrophoresis. We sheared amplified cDNA (100-500 ng) on a Covaris

396

ultrasonicator with the following settings: time 80 sec, duty cycle 10%, intensity 4, cycles per

397

burst 200. We prepared sequencing libraries with NEBNext Ultra DNA Library Prep kits (NEB)

398

and sequenced them on an Illumina NextSeq with 2x150 paired end reads (mid-output run, v2

399

chemistry). To increase the specificity of variant identification, samples with a viral load between

400

103 and 105 genome copies/μL of transport media were amplified and sequenced in duplicate.

401

Samples amplified from B/Victoria and B/Yamagata plasmid clones were included on each

402

sequencing run to account for sequencing errors. The plasmids used in the control reactions

403

were generated by segment-specific RT-PCR from clinical samples of B/Victoria and

404

B/Yamagata strains from the 2012-2013 season followed by gel extraction and TOPO-TA

405

cloning (Invitrogen). The sequence of each plasmid was determined by Sanger sequencing. We

406

generated the plasmid control amplicons included on each Illumina sequencing run using the

407

same multiplex amplification protocol, but with cloned plasmid DNA as the template.

Identification of iSNV

410
411

Intrahost single-nucleotide variants (iSNV) were identified using a previously-described analytic

412

pipeline (23). We identified iSNV in samples that had an average genome coverage greater

413

than 1000x and a viral load greater than 103 genome copies per microliter of transport media in

414

the original sample. Sequencing adapters were removed with cutadapt (31) and reads were

415

aligned to the sequences derived from the B/Victoria and B/Yamagata plasmid controls with

416

Bowtie2 (32). Duplicate reads were marked and removed with Picard and samtools (33).

417

Putative variants were identified with the R package deepSNV using data from the clonal

418

plasmid controls of each sequencing run (34). Minority iSNV (<50% frequency) were identified

419

using the following empirically-derived criteria: deepSNV p-value <0.01, average mapping

420

quality >30, average Phred score >35, and average read position in the middle 50% (positions

421

37 and 113 for 150 base pair reads). For samples processed in duplicate, we used only variants

422

that were present in both replicates; the frequency of the variant in the replicate with greater

423

coverage at that site was used. Lastly, variants with frequency <2%, which have a higher false

424

positive rate from RT-PCR and/or sequencing errors, were not included in downstream

425

analyses.

426
427

In our previous work on IAV, we found that there were multiple sites with mutations that were

428

essentially fixed (>0.95) relative to the plasmid control and in which the base in the plasmid

429

control was therefore identified as a minority variant in the sample (19). At these sites, deepSNV

430

is unable to estimate the base-specific error rate and cannot distinguish true minority iSNV;

431

however, we found that we could accurately identify minority variants at these sites at a

432

frequency of 2% or above (19). This frequency threshold was incorporated into the pipeline for

433

iSNV identification at these sites. Therefore, we report intrahost variants from 2-98%; minority

434

iSNV are the subset of these variants with a frequency between 2-50%. Any sites that were

435

monomorphic after applying quality filters were assigned a frequency of 100%.

Figure 1. Viral load and sequencing coverage. (A) Boxplot of viral load (genome copies per

565

microliter of swab transport media, y-axis) by day of sampling relative to symptom onset (x-

566

axis). The boxes display median and 25th and 75th percentiles, with whiskers extending to the

567

most extreme point within the range of the median ± 1.5 times the interquartile range; all values

568

outside this range are shown as individual points. (B) Sequencing coverage is plotted with read

569

depth on the y-axis and location within a concatenated influenza B virus genome on the x-axis.

570

The mean coverage for each sample was calculated over a sliding window of size 200 and a

571

step size of 100. The data are displayed for all samples at each window as a boxplot, showing

572

the median and 25th and 75th percentiles, with whiskers extending to the most extreme point

573

within the range of the median ± 1.5 times the interquartile range; all values outside this range

574

are shown as individual points.

Figure 2. Intrahost minority SNV by day post-symptom onset and viral load. (A) Number of

577

minority iSNV per sample is plotted on the y-axis by day post symptom onset on the x-axis.

578

Data are displayed as boxplots representing the median and 25th and 75th percentiles, with

579

whiskers extending to the most extreme point within the range of the median ±1.5 times the

580

interquartile range. The raw data points are overlaid on top of the boxplots. (B) Scatterplot

581

relating the number of minority iSNV per sample on the y-axis to the log10 of viral load, in

582

genome copies per microliter, on the x-axis. (C) Frequency of minority iSNV in samples

583

sequenced in duplicate. Orange dots represent variants identified in samples with viral load of

584

103 – 104 genome copies per microliter and blue dots represent variants in samples with viral

585

load of 104 – 105 genome copies per microliter.

Figure 3. Intrahost SNV frequency by genome position and mutation type. All minority (<50%)

588

iSNV from 99 samples are displayed with their frequency on the y-axis and their position within

589

a concatenated influenza B virus genome on the x-axis. Synonymous mutations are shown in

590

orange and nonsynonymous mutations in blue.

Figure 4. Intrahost SNV by vaccination status and IBV lineage. (A) Numbers of minority iSNV

593

per sample across all 99 samples are shown (y-axis) by current-season vaccination status of

594

the host (x-axis). (B) Numbers of minority iSNV per sample are shown (y-axis) by IBV lineage

595

(x-axis). (C) Numbers of minority iSNV per sample are shown (y-axis) by influenza virus type (x-

596

axis). Data for influenza A virus are from 249 samples described in McCrone et al. 2018. Data

597

on influenza B virus are from 99 high-quality samples in the present study. (D) Numbers of

598

minority iSNV in 43 of the 99 high-quality samples (y-axis), consisting of B/Yamagata from the

599

2014/2015 season, B/Victoria from the 2015/2016 season, and B/Yamagata from the 2016/2017

600

season based on alignments to the original references from the 2012/2013 season vs. season-

601

matched reference genomes (x-axis).

Figure 5. Identification of household transmission pairs. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree

604

of all B/Victoria (A) and B/Yamagata (B) samples from this study. Concatenated consensus

605

coding sequences were aligned with MUSCLE and phylogenetic trees constructed with RAxML.

606

Tip labels are denoted as enrollee ID, household ID, season, and lineage, separated by

607

underscores; tip labels are color-coded by household ID. (C) Histogram of genetic distance, as

608

measured by L1-norm, between household pairs and random community pairs from the same

609

season and lineage. The bar heights for each group are normalized to the maximum for each

610

group for comparison. Community pairs are shown in orange and household pairs shown in

611

blue. The dotted red line indicates the 5th percentile of the community pair distribution.
