Abstract
Fully consolidated associative memories may be altered by alternative retrieval dependent
memory processes. While a brief exposure to the conditioned stimulus (CS) can trigger
reconsolidation of the original memory, a prolonged CS exposure will trigger memory
extinction. The conditioned response is maintained after reconsolidation, but is inhibited after
extinction, presumably by the formation of a new inhibitory memory trace. In rats and
humans, it has been shown that CS exposure of intermediate duration leave the memory in an
insensitive or limbo state. Limbo is characterised by the absence of reconsolidation or
extinction. Here we investigated the evolutionary conserved nature of limbo using a
contextual Pavlovian conditioning (CPC) memory paradigm in the crab Neohelice granulata.
In animals with fully consolidated CPC memory, systemic administration of the protein
synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide after 1 CS presentation disrupted the memory, presumably
by interfering with memory reconsolidation. The same intervention given after 320 CSs
prevented CPC memory extinction. Cycloheximide had no behavioural effect when
administered after 80 CS presentations, a protocol that failed to extinguish CPC memory.
Also, we observed that a stronger CPC memory engaged reconsolidation after 80 CS instead
of limbo, indicating that memory strength affects the parametrical conditions to engage either
reconsolidation or limbo. Altogether, these results indicate that limbo is an evolutionary
conserved memory process segregating reconsolidation from extinction in the number of CSs
space. Limbo appears as an intrinsic component of retrieval dependent memory processing,
with a key function in the transition from memory maintenance to inhibition.

1. Introduction
Paired presentations of an environmental stimulus that initially has no intrinsic biological
significance (conditioned stimulus, CS), with a biologically relevant outcome (unconditioned
stimulus, US), lead to the formation of an associative memory CS-US. Recently formed
associative memories exist in a fragile state and are susceptible to behavioural or
pharmacological disruption. However, through consolidation these memories become
resistant to disruption (Dudai, Karni, and Born, 2015). For decades it was believed that fully
consolidated memories remained unchangeable, but recent evidence indicate that memories
are dynamic entities and their content or strength could be affected in a retrieval dependent
manner (Reichelt and Lee, 2013).
In animals with a fully consolidated CS-US memory, presentation of the CS alone can trigger
alternative memory processes, depending on the presentation parameters. On the one hand, a
brief CS alone exposure will typically destabilise the memory, making it sensitive to
amnestic agents, and trigger a restabilisation process that returns the memory to a stable state.
This process called memory reconsolidation maintains the conditioned response towards the
CS and constitutes an opportunity for updating the original CS-US memory, enabling
changes in strength and content (Forcato, Rodriguez, and Pedreira, 2011; Forcato, Rodriguez,
Pedreira, and Maldonado, 2010; Frenkel, Maldonado, and Delorenzi, 2005; Fukushima,
Zhang, Archbold, Ishikawa, Nader, and Kida, 2014; Lee, 2010). On the other hand, a more
prolonged CS exposure will more likely trigger memory extinction and a reduction of the
conditioned response. Importantly, extinction does not erase the original memory, but relies
on formation of a new associative trace between the CS and the absence of the US (CSnoUS) and concomitant decrease in CS-US memory expression (Bouton, 2004; Delamater
and Westbrook, 2014; Pagani and Merlo, 2019). Hence, depending on the duration or number
of CS alone events, in animals with fully consolidated CS-US memory retrieval could trigger

alternative and behaviourally opposite processes (Lee, Milton, and Everitt, 2006; Pedreira
and Maldonado, 2003). Increasing exposure to the CS alone shifts the neural system from
maintenance to inhibition of the original memory engaging reconsolidation or extinction,
respectively. Recently it was reported that these memory mechanisms are mutually exclusive,
and that intermediate CS exposure sessions fail to engage either process. In auditory fear
conditioned rats intermediate CS exposures engage a novel retrieval-dependent process
which we have called ‘limbo’, characterised by insensitivity of the CS-US memory to
amnestic treatments and a lack of extinction-specific molecular correlates (Merlo, Milton,
and Everitt, 2018; Merlo, Milton, Goozee, Theobald, and Everitt, 2014). Limbo has also been
documented for Pavlovian-conditioned contextual fear, and appetitive memories in rats
(Cassini, Flavell, Amaral, and Lee, 2017; Flavell and Lee, 2013; Franzen, Giachero, and
Bertoglio, 2019), as well as conditioned fear in humans (Kindt, Soeter, and Sevenster, 2014).
There is little mechanistic information about limbo. Canonical plasticity-related mechanisms
of reconsolidation and extinction, such as requirement of NMDA-type glutamate or GABA
receptor activity, or activation of the kinase ERK1/2 in the basolateral amygdala, are not
necessary (Franzen et al., 2019; Merlo et al., 2018; Merlo et al., 2014). Thus far, protein
synthesis requirement during limbo has not been established. Considering the remarkable
evolutionary persistence of most underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of memory
processes across species, in this work we will analyse limbo protein synthesis dependence
using an associative memory paradigm in crabs.
Associative memory experiments in the crab Neohelice granulata have made important
contributions towards better understanding the effects of retrieval on memory persistence.
Besides documenting that reconsolidation and extinction are evolutionary conserved features,
research in crabs indicates that triggering reconsolidation requires prediction error in the form
of a mismatch between training and retrieval conditions or changes in the reinforcement ratio

(López, Santos, Cortasa, Fernandez, Carbó Tano, and Pedreira, 2016; Pedreira, Perez-Cuesta,
and Maldonado, 2004). The crab’s associative learning paradigm is based on the animal’s
innate escape response, which is elicited by the presentation of an inescapable visual danger
stimulus (VDS; an opaque rectangle moving horizontally above the animal). Repeated VDS
presentations induce a change in behavioural response from escape to freezing (Pereyra,
Gonzalez Portino, and Maldonado, 2000) and formation of an associative memory between
the VDS (US) and a cue light (CS) presented above the animal (Fustiñana, Carbo Tano,
Romano, and Pedreira, 2013). Escape response from trained animals at test, typically
conducted at 24 hours or more, will be significantly lower than untrained controls, indicating
the formation of an associative CS-US long-term memory. Animals with a fully consolidated
so-called contextual Pavlovian conditioning (CPC) memory undergo reconsolidation when
exposed to a brief CS alone trial, and extinction when exposed to a prolonged CS (Fustiñana
et al., 2013). Both memory reconsolidation and extinction in the crab require protein
synthesis, among other conserved neural mechanisms (Pedreira and Maldonado, 2003).
We tested the hypothesis that intermediate number of CS alone presentations will trigger
limbo of the CPC memory. We predicted that in crabs with consolidated CPC memory,
systemic administration of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide will: 1) disrupt the
original CPC memory after exposure to a small number of CSs; 2) disrupt CPC extinction
after a prolonged CS exposure session; and 3) have no behavioural effect after an
intermediate CS exposure session. If so, our results will indicate that, not only is limbo an
evolutionary conserved feature of retrieval-dependent memory processing but also, that it is
protein synthesis independent. Additionally, we analysed whether a stronger CPC memory
would require a higher number of CS presentations to enter limbo, in comparison with a lessstrong ‘standard’ memory. In this regard, we predicted that animals trained with 30 CS-US

trials would require a larger number of CS presentations to engage limbo compared to
animals trained with 15 trials.

2. Materials & Methods
2.1 Animals
Adult male Neohelice granulata (formerly known as Chasmagnathus granulatus, Crustacea,
Grapsidae) intertidal crabs, measuring 2.6-2.9 cm across the carapace and weighting ~17 g,
were collected from water <1 m deep in the estuarine coasts of San Clemente del Tuyú,
Buenos Aires province, Argentina. Once transported to the laboratory, they were housed in
plastic tanks (30 x 45 x 20 cm) filled to 0.5 cm depth with diluted (12‰, pH 7.4-7.6) marine
water (Red Sea’s Coral Pro Salt) to a density of 20 crabs per tank. The holding room was
maintained on a 12-h light-dark cycle (light on at 07:00). Temperature on both holding and
experimental rooms was maintained at 22-24 °C. Experiments were carried out between the
3rd and the 10th day after the arrival of the animals. Each crab was used in only one
experiment. Experimental procedures are in compliance with the National Institutes of Health
Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (USA) and the Argentinean guidelines on the
ethical use of animals in laboratory experiments. All efforts were made to minimize animal
suffering and to reduce the number of animals used.

2.2 Experimental device
The experimental device has been described in detail elsewhere (Fustiñana et al., 2013).
Briefly, the experimental unit was a bowl-shaped opaque container surrounded by a steep
concave wall 12 cm high (23 cm top diameter and 9 cm floor diameter). The container was
filled with marine water to a depth of 0.5 cm. The crab was placed in the container and could
freely move inside but was not able to escape from it. The container could be illuminated

from above or below by using an array of 3 LED bulbs (3mm, 1w each) and 10-W daylight
lamp, respectively. A motor-operated screen (US, an opaque rectangular strip of 25.0 x 7.5
cm) was moved horizontally over the animal from left to right, and vice versa. The screen’s
movements were cyclical. The screen displacements provoked the crab escape response. Each
trial consisted of two successive cycles of screen movement. The experimental room had 20
experimental units separated by white walls, so that 20 crabs could be trained or tested
independently and simultaneously. In each experiment, crabs and containers were assigned in
a counterbalanced manner such that subjects belonging to each experimental group were
included in every session. The experimental scheme was repeated until reaching the final
number of animals for the experiment. Escape responses were video recorded at 10 Hz. Two
days before the beginning of each experiment, animals were marked with a little round piece
(0.5 cm diameter) of white ethylene-vinyl acetate glued to the centre of the carapace. Animal
movement during training and testing trials was analysed by tracking x-y displacement of the
white spots over time, using a customized image tracking software. A computer was used to
programme trial sequences, illumination and duration, inter-trial intervals, and to monitor the
experimental events.

2.3 Experimental procedure
All experimental groups started with 40 crabs. Between sessions, animals were housed
individually in opaque plastic cylinders filled to depth of 0.5 cm with artificial sea water,
inside dimly lit drawers and isolated from external stimulation. All behavioural sessions were
preceded by 10 min of habituation to the experimental device with illumination from below.
Training session (Day 1). A ‘standard’ contextual Pavlovian conditioning (CPC) training
procedure consisted of 15 trials, whereas a ‘strong’ training procedure consisted of 30 trials.
Each trial lasted 27 s with above illumination (CS), and the US was presented during the last

9 s. During the intertrial interval (ITI; 153 s), the experimental unit was illuminated from
below, which provoked a virtual change in the environmental features. All animals received
one US presentation to evaluate individual reactivity. Untrained animals were kept in the
experimental unit during the entire training procedure and were presented with the same
pattern of light shift than trained animals, but without USs.
CS exposure session and drug administration (Day 2). Twenty-four hours after training,
crabs were placed in their respective training context. A specific amount of CS alone events
(1, 40, 80, 160 or 320 presentations, depending on the experiment) were presented to each
animal. Each CS presentation consisted of 27 s of above illumination (CS, ITI = 27 s).
Immediately after, crabs were returned to their individual housing container. One hour later
they were injected with either drug or vehicle solution.
Test session (Day 3). Twenty-four hours after CS exposure, crabs returned to their training
context and received a CS-US trial during which the escape response was measured.

2.4 Drugs and injection procedure
The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX, Sigma-Aldrich C7698) (Pedreira,
Dimant, Tomsic, Quesada-Allue, and Maldonado, 1995) was diluted in crustacean saline
solution (450 mM NaCl, 15 mM CaCl2, 21 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl) (Hoeger and Florey,
1989) and administered systemically at a final dose of 2.35 µg/g. Fifty microlitres of vehicle
(VHC) or drug solution were injected through the right side of the dorsal cephalothoraxicabdominal membrane by means of a syringe needle fitted with a sleeve to control the depth of
penetration to 4 mm, thus ensuring that the injected solution was released in the pericardial
sac. Given that crabs lack an endothelial blood-brain barrier (Abbott, 1970), and that blood is
distributed by a capillary system in the central nervous system (Sandeman, 1967), systemic
injected drugs readily reach the brain.

2.5 Data analysis and drug effect evaluation
Memory retention was defined as a statistically significant lower conditioned response level
on the testing session by the trained (TR) group, relative to its respective untrained (CT)
group (i.e. both groups were injected with the same solution or exposed to the same number
of CSs during Day 2). A lack of difference between a CT-TR pair was taken to indicate no
CPC memory retention. Depending on experimental conditions, this could be due to amnesia
or CPC memory extinction. A comparison between CT groups injected with either CHX or
VHC was necessary to control for CHX side effects that may have affected response level at
testing in a manner unrelated to the behavioural experience. In general, statistical analysis of
test data included three a priori planned comparisons: CT-VHC vs. TR-VHC; CT-VHC vs.
CT-CHX; and CT-CHX vs. TR-CHX. These comparisons were based on extensive prior
experience indicating that spaced training with 15 or more trials results in memory retention,
and on the prediction that the specific pharmacological manipulation should be free of nonmnemonic behavioural effects. If these two predictions were fulfilled the experiment will be
valid to analyse the effect of the drug on memory. Escape responses are represented as mean
± SEM normalised to the respective vehicle control group (CT-VHC). Behavioural data were
analysed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with α (per comparison error rate)
= 0.05, and a priori planned comparisons using IBM SPSS Statistics software (Version 22.0;
Armonk, NY: IBM Corp). Effect sizes were calculated using partial eta square.
Given that some of our predictions about the engagement of limbo for intermediate number
of CS presentations favoured the alternative hypothesis over the null hypothesis, we also
analysed the data with Bayesian statistics. For each experiment we used Bayesian ANOVA
followed by the same comparisons made in frequentist analysis using one-tailed Bayesian
Independent Samples T-Tests (JASP, v0.10; JASP Team, 2019). BFs were interpreted using

the categories proposed by Jeffreys (Jeffreys, 1961; Wetzels, Matzke, Lee, Rouder, Iverson,
and Wagenmakers, 2011). BF10 represents the probability of the data to be explained by the
alternative hypothesis (H1: at test, escape response in TR group is lower than CT) relative to
the null hypothesis (H0: at test, escape response in TR group is similar to CT). For clarity,
BF10 < 1 indicates that the null hypothesis was 1/BF10 more likely to explain the data, than
the alternative hypothesis.

3. Results
3.1 A protein synthesis independent memory process segregates reconsolidation and
extinction of CPC memory
Crabs with fully consolidated CPC memory will undergo reconsolidation or extinction when
exposed to a brief (27 s) or prolonged (2h) CS alone event, respectively (Fustiñana et al.,
2013). In order to test our main hypothesis, stating that an intermediate CS exposure session
will trigger limbo in crabs with fully consolidated CPC memory, we conducted three
independent experiments. Considering that both memory reconsolidation and extinction are
proteins synthesis dependent mechanisms, we used post-retrieval systemic injections of
cycloheximide as a tool to reveal the dominant memory process after different CS exposure
sessions.
We first evaluated the effect of cycloheximide after a single CS alone presentation. Animals
were either trained with 15 CS-US trials (TR group) or remained in the training context for a
similar duration (CT group), during Day 1. Twenty-four hours later, all animals were
exposure to one CS alone event. One hour later, both CT and TR groups were divided and
injected with either vehicle (CT-VHC, TR-VHC) or cycloheximide solution (CT-CHX, TRCHX) before returning to their housing container. On Day 3, CPC memory was evaluated by
presenting all animals with a single CS-US trial (Figure 1A, nCS = 1). One-way ANOVA of
the escape response during test showed a main effect of group (F (3, 105) = 2.90, p = 0.04, η2 =
0.08). As expected, the vehicle injected CT-TR pair showed memory retention, with the TR
group expressing a lower escape response compared to CT (CT-VHC vs TR-VHC: t

memory retention in TR-CHX animals (Figure 1B). Bayes analysis on the vehicle injected
CT-TR pair indicated that the alternative hypothesis (i.e. escape response in TR animals is
different to CT animals) is 4.08 times more likely than the null hypothesis (CT-VHC vs TRVHC: BF10 = 4.08). For the cycloheximide injected CT-TR pair the null hypothesis (i.e.
escape response in TR animals was similar to CT animals) is 3.1 times more likely than the
alternative hypothesis (CT-CHX vs TR-CHX: BF10 = 0.32). A similar outcome was found for
comparison of both CT groups (CT-VHC vs CT-CHX: BF10 = 0.29). Hence, both frequentist
and Bayesian analysis support the conclusion that crabs with fully consolidated CPC memory
presented with 1 CS alone engage memory labilisation-reconsolidation.
Next we analysed the effect of post-retrieval cycloheximide after exposure to an intermediate
number of CS presentations. The experimental design was similar to the previous experiment,
but on Day 2 animals were exposed to 80 CS presentations, in the absence of USs (Figure
1A, nCS = 80). Analysis of the escape response during test showed a main effect of group
(ANOVA: F

(3, 139)

CT-TR groups showed memory retention (CT-VHC vs TR-VHC: t (139) = 2.89, p = 0.005, η2
= 0.10; CT-CHX vs TR-CHX: t (139) = 2.33, p = 0.021, η2 = 0.08), with no non-specific effect
of CHX (CT-VHC vs. CT-CHX: t

analysis indicated that in either vehicle or cycloheximide injected CT-TR pairs the alternative
hypothesis was 4.8 and 4.1 more likely than the null hypothesis, respectively (CT-VEH vs
TR-VEH: BF10 = 4.82; CT-CHX vs TR-CHX: BF10 = 4.08). The null hypothesis was 4 times
more likely when comparing both CT groups (CT-VHC vs CT-CHX: BF10 = 0.25). These
results indicate that 80 CSs were insufficient to produce extinction, but equally failed to
render the CPC memory labile and sensitive to cycloheximide amnestic effect. Thus, CPC
memory in crabs exposed to an intermediate number of CSs enters limbo.

In order to confirm that CPC memory extinguishes with larger CS exposure we run an
additional experiment. Crabs were trained as before, but on Day 2 they were exposed to 320
CS alone presentations before vehicle or cycloheximide systemic administration (Figure 1A,
nCS = 320). An ANOVA on escape responses during test showed a main effect of group (F (3,

= 0.06). Planned comparisons showed that there was no memory

retention in the vehicle injected TR group (CT-VHC vs. TR-VHC: t (152) = 0.18, p = 0.86, η2
= 0.0004) indicating the extinction of the conditioned response by 320 CSs alone
presentations. Cycloheximide injected TR group showed a lower escape response at test
compared with the CT group (CT-CHX vs. TR-CHX: t

(152)

indicating extinction disruption due to protein synthesis inhibition after 320 CS presentations.
Control groups showed a similar escape response (CT-VHC vs. CT-CHX: t
0.86,

η

2

(152)

= 0.18, p =

= 0.0004), discarding non-specific effects of the drug at test (Figure 1D). Bayesian

analysis showed that in the vehicle injected pair the null hypothesis is 4.2 more likely than
the alternative hypothesis (CT-VHC vs TR-VHC: BF10 = 0.24), whereas in the
cycloheximide injected pair the alternative hypothesis was 5.6 times more likely (CT-CHX vs
TR-CHX: BF10 = 5.56). The null hypothesis was 4.2 times more likely when comparing both
CT groups (CT-VHC vs CT-CHX: BF10 = 0.24).
Next we evaluated whether retrieval was necessary, but not sufficient, for cycloheximide
amnestic effect over CPC memory. The experiment included three CT-TR pair of groups. On
Day 2 two of the CT-TR pairs were exposed to either 1 or 80 CS presentations, whereas the
third pair remained in their home container (non-reactivated pair, NR). One hour after CS
exposure all animals received systemic cycloheximide injections (Figure 2A). At test, there
was a main effect of group on escape responses (ANOVA: F

and injected with the drug one hour later (CT-1CS vs TR-1CS: t

the drug showed memory retention (CT-80CS vs TR-80CS: t (207) = 2.37, p = 0.02, η2 = 0.08).
Bayesian analysis showed that in the non-reactivated or the 80 CS groups, the alternative
hypothesis was 3 or 3.9 times more likely than the null hypothesis, respectively (CT-NR vs
TR-NR: BF10 = 3.01; CT-80CS vs TR-80CS: BF10 = 3.89). For crabs exposed to 1 CS and
injected with cycloheximide, the escape data at test was 3.2 times more likely to be explained
by the null hypothesis (CT-1CS vs TR-1CS: BF10 = 0.31; Figure 2B).
Once more, we observed that cycloheximide disrupted CPC memory after 1 CS presentation
in a retrieval dependent manner but has no effect on CPC memory when administered after
80 CS presentations. Even though CPC memory retrieval is a necessary condition for
cycloheximide to exert an amnestic effect, it is not sufficient. Retrieval duration critically
affects memory sensitivity to protein synthesis inhibition.
In order to gain a better insight on memory lability along increasing duration of CS exposure,
we evaluated the effect of cycloheximide on memory performance after 40 or 160 CS alone
presentation sessions. Cycloheximide disrupted CPC memory when administered after 40
CSs, indicating that this number of CSs also triggers memory labilisation-reconsolidation.
Conversely, there was no effect of cycloheximide administered after 160 CS presentation
(Supplementary Figure 1). After either 80 or 160 CS presentations, the original CPC memory
was insensitive to CHX, and also non extinguished, strongly suggesting limbo engagement
by these reminders.
These results not only confirmed the protein synthesis dependency of reconsolidation and
extinction of CPC memory in crabs, but also shows for the first time that invertebrate
memory processing also engages limbo after an intermediate number of CS presentations.

3.2 The boundary between reconsolidation and limbo depends on memory strength
In the previous experiment we established that a standard CPC memory enters limbo after an
80 CS long reminder session. We next examined whether the number of CSs necessary to
engage limbo were dependent on memory strength.
We first evaluated the engagement of reconsolidation by presentation of a single CS alone
event (Figure 3A, nCS = 1). Crabs were trained with a ‘strong’ training session consisting of
30 CS-US trials (TR groups) or remained in the training environment for a similar amount of
time (CT groups). Twenty-four hours later, animals were exposed to one CS trial and
received an injection of vehicle or cycloheximide solution one hour later. An ANOVA on the
escape responses during the test session at Day 3 showed a main effect of group (F

= 0.12). Planned comparisons showed memory retention for the vehicle

injected TR group (CT-VHC vs. TR-VHC: t (143) = 4.12, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.19), but not for the
cycloheximide treated TR group (CT-CHX vs. TR-CHX: t

(143)

Escape responding was similar for CT groups (CT-VHC vs. CT-CHX: t (143) = 1.40, p = 0.16,
η

= 0.03), indicating no non-specific effect of the drug treatment at test (Figure 3B).

Bayesian analysis indicated that in the vehicle injected CT-TR pair, the alternative hypothesis
was 434 times more likely than the null hypothesis (CT-VHC vs TR-VHC, BF10 = 434.07),
whereas for the cycloheximide injected pair, the data were 2 times more likely explained by
the null hypothesis (CT-CHX vs TR-CHX, BF10 = 0.5). The null hypothesis was 1.9 times
more likely when comparing both CT groups (CT-VHC vs CT-CHX, BF10 = 0.53).
Next we evaluated the effect of cycloheximide after exposure to 80 CSs, a manipulation that
did not affect the conditioned response if crabs were trained with the standard protocol
(Figure 1C). Animals were trained with 30 CS-US trials as before. Twenty-four hours later,
all animals were presented with 80 CS alone trials and injected with either vehicle or

cycloheximide solutions one hour later (Figure 3A, nCS = 80). An ANOVA on the escape
response level during test (Day 3) revealed a main effect of group (F (3, 144) = 4.70, p = 0.004,
η

2

= 0.09). We observed memory retention for the TR-VEH group (CT-VHC vs. TR-VHC: t

(145)

η

= 0.09), but amnesia for the TR-CHX group (CT-CHX vs. TR-

CHX: t (145) = 0.60, p = 0.55, η2 = 0.005). Both CT groups showed similar escape responses at
test (CT-VHC vs. CT-CHX: t

(145)

= 0.77, p = 0.44,

η

2

= 0.008), indicating no non-specific

effect of the drug (Figure 3C). Bayesian analysis indicates that the alternative hypothesis is
9.4 times more likely in the vehicle injected CT-TR pair (CT-VHC vs TR-VHC, BF10 =
9.36), whereas the null hypothesis is 3.7 times more likely to explain the data for the
cycloheximide injected pair (CT-CHX vs TR-CHX, BF10 = 0.27). The null hypothesis was
3.3 times more likely when comparing both CT groups (CT-VHC vs CT-CHX, BF10 = 0.3).
These results show that a stronger CPC memory engages reconsolidation after either a single
or 80 CS presentations, suggesting that the experimental parameters to trigger limbo are
affected by memory strength such that stronger memories require a larger CS exposure
session to engage limbo, with no effect on reconsolidation engagement by 1 CS presentation.

4. Discussion
In the present study we analysed the evolutionary conserved nature of limbo, a recently
discovered retrieval dependent memory phase that segregates the processes of memory
reconsolidation and extinction in the CS exposure domain. In particular, we evaluated
whether in crabs with fully consolidated memory an intermediate re-exposure session would
engage limbo, characterised by the absence of reconsolidation or extinction processes. Using
post-retrieval systemic administration of cycloheximide as an amnestic agent, we observed
that crabs with fully consolidated contextual Pavlovian conditioning (CPC) memory engaged
memory reconsolidation after 1 or 40 CS alone events. To the contrary, presentation of 320
CSs triggered CPC memory extinction. Exposure to intermediate number of CSs (80 or 160)
not only rendered the original CPC memory immune to cycloheximide, but also failed to
extinguish it. This pattern of results clearly indicates that in crabs, reconsolidation and
extinction are mutually exclusive processes, triggered by extreme reminder conditions. These
alternative and opposing memory mechanisms are segregated in the CS exposure domain by
an insensitive, limbo phase. Also, we observed that a stronger CPC memory requires more
than 80 CSs to engage limbo, suggesting that memory strength is a boundary condition for
limbo. These data indicate that limbo is present in invertebrates and independent of de novo
protein synthesis, and that the absolute number of CSs that engage limbo is affected by
memory attributes. We propose a transition model for retrieval dependent memory processing
in crabs, with the processes of reconsolidation, limbo and extinction being engaged
exclusively and sequentially as the number of CS presentations to animals with fully
consolidated memory increases (Figure 4).

Limbo has been previously described as a retrieval dependent memory phase in vertebrates,
affecting associative memories established with aversive and appetitive reinforcement. Our
findings of alternative retrieval-dependent memory processes are not unprecedented and
similar effects can be found across experimental paradigms and species. Blockade of βadrenoreceptors by propranolol disrupts an associative fear memory in humans when
administered after 2 CS presentations, whereas it has no behavioural effect after 4 CS
presentations (Sevenster, Beckers, and Kindt, 2014). In cued fear conditioned rats, NMDA
type glutamate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist MK-801 disrupts either reconsolidation or
extinction when administered in conjunction with 1 or 10 CS presentations, respectively, but
has no effect when given before 4 CSs. Similarly, NMDAR partial agonist D-cycloserine
positively modulated the dominant memory process induced by 1 or 10 CS presentations but
had no behavioural effect when given before 4 CSs (Merlo et al., 2014). Contextual fear
conditioning in rats also shows a retrieval dependent insensitive phase with intermediate
reminder durations. In this case, limbo was found using GABA enhancer midazolam (Alfei,
Ferrer Monti, Molina, Bueno, and Urcelay, 2015; Franzen et al., 2019) or NMDAR
antagonist MK-801 (Cassini et al., 2017). Moreover, limbo was also reported in rats lever
pressing for food pellets. Systemic administration of MK-801 disrupted food seeking
behaviour or its extinction in conjunction with a short (10 lever presses without food) or
prolonged (50 lever presses) reminder session, respectively. However, MK-801
administration had no effect when given before an intermediate duration session (30 lever
presses) (Flavell and Lee, 2013). In medaka fish, administration of an amnestic agent that
disrupts reconsolidation or extinction under extreme reminder conditions had no behavioural
effect when administered after an intermediate number of CSs (Eisenberg, Kobilo, Berman,
and Dudai, 2003).

Finding limbo in crabs using cycloheximide injections, not only shows for the first time that
it is an evolutionary conserved feature, but also that it is immune to the ‘gold standard’
amnestic manipulation in experimental neurobiology, inhibition of protein synthesis. This
evidence strongly suggests limbo constitutes an intrinsic property of memory processing
present along diverse taxa within the Animal Kingdom, from invertebrates to mammals. This
common trait across phyla could be provided by common homologous circuits (Strausfeld
and Hirth, 2013) supporting adaptive selection of alternative behaviours. Moreover, its
protein synthesis independence sets limbo clearly apart in terms of neural mechanisms
supporting both memory reconsolidation, extinction, and even consolidation. Limbo
contribution to memory persistence or inhibition remains to be determined.

Limbo boundary conditions
A close analysis of the reminder structure that leads to limbo in different memory paradigms
highlights some key properties. Similar to memory reconsolidation and extinction processes,
limbo engagement requires a reminder with prediction error, but of intermediate duration or
number of events. Unlike memory extinction, limbo does not affect conditioned performance.
Also, in crabs we observed that the sheer number of CS presentations required to trigger
limbo is considerably larger to the number reported in other memory paradigms, suggesting
that this variable is not important in isolation. Notably, in humans, limbo was induced after
only 4 CS presentations (Sevenster et al., 2014), whereas in crabs it was observed after either
80 or 160 CS presentations. The ratios between CSs to engage limbo to CS-US trials at
training are also variable across species, with the crab experiments requiring a ratio between
6 and more than 10, while other paradigms showed ratios of as little as 2 (Merlo et al., 2014;
Sevenster et al., 2014). Moreover, limbo is not exclusively engaged in associative memories
using discrete CSs as in our experiments; contextual fear memories, where environmental

context serves as the CS, show that intermediate exposure duration also engage limbo
(Cassini et al., 2017).
Here we discovered that limbo engagement depends on memory strength. Previous reports
showed that memory strength affects the CS exposure required to trigger either memory
reconsolidation or extinction. Stronger associative memories require longer CS alone
exposure to enter reconsolidation or extinction, compared to a standard memory (Baumgartel,
Genoux, Welzl, Tweedie-Cullen, Koshibu, Livingstone-Zatchej, Mamie, and Mansuy, 2008;
Suzuki, Josselyn, Frankland, Masushige, Silva, and Kida, 2004). In this study, we observed
that memory strength alters the parametrical conditions to engage reconsolidation and limbo.
A stronger memory, produced by doubling the training duration from 15 to 30 CS-US trials,
changed the efficacy of 80 CS presentations to engage limbo to memory reconsolidation
(Figure 3). In contrast to previous observations showing a right-shift on reconsolidation
engagement for stronger memories, reconsolidation of the stronger CPC memory was still
engaged by 1 CS presentation. Thus, CPC memory strength in crabs modulates the upper
limit of the CS exposure domain capable of inducing memory reconsolidation, without
apparent effects on the lower limit. These observations reinforce the idea that sheer number
of CS alone presentations is not a crucial parameter determining memory reconsolidation or
limbo engagement. Altogether, these observations strongly suggest that memory strength is a
boundary condition for the three alternative retrieval dependent memory processes:
reconsolidation, limbo and memory extinction.

Finding that limbo is an essential part of retrieval dependent memory processes in
invertebrates has both theoretical and practical implications. Even though the
psychobiological function of limbo remains unclear, its evolutionary constancy suggests a
putative role on memory persistence control. Limbo engagement might be necessary as a

functional segregation between alternative and opposing memory processes, terminating
reconsolidation and preparing the system for extinction. Clearly, more research will be
necessary to answer these questions. Our work opens the possibility to explore limbo using a
variety of experimental advantages and tools (e.g. simpler brains, easy access to neurons and
networks, genetic manipulations) that are only available in invertebrates and can probe
essential to reveal the intricate relationship of brain processes underlying persistence or
inhibition of retrieved memories.
