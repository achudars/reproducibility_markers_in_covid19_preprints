Summary

Drosophila melanogaster is a suitable model for investigating how neuropeptides influence
animal behaviours and physiology. We previously reported that two behavioural paradigms
control mating duration of male Drosophila, called Longer-Mating-Duration (LMD) and
Shorter-Mating-Duration (SMD) that are induced through socio-sexual environment prior to
copulation. Understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which males exhibit
plasticity to different social cues remains poorly understood. Here, we show that SIFa modulates
the neural circuitry for both LMD and SMD. Neuropeptide-to-neuropeptide communication, so
called ‘neuropeptide relay’ plays a key role to mediate this control. We identified that 7
neuropeptides expressed in SIFa Receptor-positive cells are functionally important to regulate
either LMD and/or SMD. The modulation of two independent mating duration behaviour by the
different SIFa-mediated neuropeptide relay will help to further investigate how the
neuropeptidergic modulation can control complex behaviours.

INTRODUCTION
Neuropeptides represents a diverse class of signaling molecules that modifies neural activities
and neural circuit dynamics. One of its fundamental features is its ability to modulate the
properties of neural circuits (i.e. decision-making circuits and/or pattern generators) by changing
neuronal excitability causing them to be multifunctional [1]. Neuromodulators are coupled into
highly complex networks, from which distinct behavioural qualities emerge as a basis of these
functions [2].
Neuropeptides constitutes a large and diverse class of signaling molecules that are produced by
various types of neurons, which modulates many insect behaviours and physiology [3,4]. Recent
advances in neurobiological research have suggested that neural circuits encompassing
neuropeptide relay signaling are essential modulators for various behaviours, including feeding,
energy homeostasis, sleep and wakefulness [5–11]. It has been well know that appetite and
satiety work together to regulate the balance of animal’s physiology and behaviour through
neuropeptide relay. For example, the hypothalamus in mouse brain functions as a central
regulator in satiety control using two opposing types of neurons, orexigenic and anorexigenic
neurons of which are distinctively characterized by the expression of specific neuropeptides such
as NPY/AgRP or POMC/CART [6].

It has been recently reported that male-specific mating behaviours are also modulated by
neuropeptide relay [13–15]. In Drosophila, males respond to potential threats in mating
competition by altering their behaviour prior to copulation. One of these strategies is the male’s
ability to accurately control mating duration. We reported that the rival-induced extended

mating, Longer-Mating-Duration (LMD) [13,14] and sexual experience-based shortened mating,
Shorter-Mating-Duration (SMD) of Drosophila provide powerful models for investigating
neuropeptidergic systems as its molecular and cellular mechanisms. LMD signaling relies on two
neuropeptides, PDF and NPF, which is modified by the male’s prior experience with other rival
male flies [13,14]. In contrast, SMD signaling is modulated by prior sexual experience which
induces neuronal changes to sNPF neurons [15]. Despite much evidence indicating that
neuropeptidergic systems are actively involved, how these modulatory effects result in circuitlevel consequences is still not well understood.

The neuropeptide AYRKPPFNGSIFamide or SIFa, is a neuromodulator that demonstrates
plasticity on a molecular and behavioural level. SIFa was first identified in grey fleshfly
Neobellieria bullata [16–18] and is expressed by four neurons located in the pars intercerebralis
which is well distributed throughout the brain and VNC by its morphology [19]. This
neuropeptide has significant impact on various behaviours including appetite [12], courtship
[17], and sleep [20]. However, the mechanism of SIFa signaling controlling various behaviours
is not well understood.

Here, we report the relationship between the SIFa-mediated signaling and its functional
relevance to LMD and SMD in D. melanogaster. The modulation of two independent
behavioural paradigm controlling mating duration by SIFa-mediated neuropeptide relay will help
to further investigate how the neuropeptidergic modulation can control complex behaviours.

Drosophila Stock Lines
All flies were raised in 12:12 light to night conditions for all experiments. Each fly is collected
between 0-3 days after eclosion are assigned to either the LMD or SMD paradigm. Once
collected, male flies are retained in same environment until further manipulations are needed.
LMD conditions contain group-reared (naïve) and singly-reared flies whereas SMD conditions
contain group-reared (naïve) and sexually experienced-reared.
Mating Duration Assay / Mating Assay
The mating duration assay in this manuscript has already reported elsewhere [13–15]. In this
manuscript, we merged LMD and SMD assay together. In short, to setup mating duration assay,
measurement for LMD is calculated between group-reared (naïve) and singly-reared flies
whereas measurement for SMD is calculated between group-reared (naïve) and sexually
experienced-reared. The relative significant difference between each groups determines whether
each behaviour is exhibited or not. To setup experiment, each fly is put to sleep using CO2
system then assigned to mating chamber which contains up to 36 pairs of flies. When performing
assay, only flies that mate for at least 10 minutes are included in total results.
Immunohistochemistry
The dissection and immunostaining protocols for the experiments are described elsewhere [13–
15]. In short, the Drosophila brain will be extracted from adult flies after 5 days of eclosion and
fixed into 4% formaldehyde for 30 minutes at room temperature. The sample will be washed in
1% PBT three times (30 minutes each) and blocked in 5% normal donkey serum for 30 minutes.
The sample will then be incubated with primary antibodies in 1% PBT at 4°C overnight followed

by the addition of fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature.
The brain will be placed onto an antifade mounting solution (Invitrogen) on slides for imaging.
Statistical Tests
All statistical tests were conducted using Graphpad Prism 5. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was
conducted for all experimental conditions and Tukey’s test to determine significance within
groups examined. For internal control, we performed experiments using wild-type for each
experiment for internal comparison. (*** = p < 0.001, ** = p < 0.01, * = p < 0.05).
RESULTS
SIFa acts as a ‘molecular switch’ between LMD and SMD
To investigate how SIFa signaling modulates LMD and SMD of male fruit flies, we merged the
two behavioural paradigms of LMD and SMD as we previously described [13–15]. Thus,
malenaive represents group-reared condition, malesingle represents singly-reared, and maleexp.
represents group-reared males with prior sexual experience (The first panel in Fig. 1A). The
difference between malenaive and malesingle represents LMD behaviour and difference between
malenaive and maleexp. SMD behaviour. When we found the differences in statistical significant
manner, we explain it as LMD and/or SMD behaviour is ‘intact’. However when we found the
difference between groups is non-significant, we explains it as LMD and/or SMD behaviour has
‘disrupted’ or ‘disappeared’ [13–15].
To understand the function of SIFa in LMD and SMD, we knocked down SIFa neuropeptide
using SIFa-RNAi with pan-neuronal elav-GAL4 driver. The results showed that pan-neuronal
knockdown of SIFa disrupts both LMD and SMD (The first panel in Fig. 1A). Neuropeptides are

generally packaged in large dense-core vesicles, and co-existed with neurotransmitters in small
synaptic vesicles [21]. To confirm whether LMD and/or SMD is controlled by synaptic vesicle
transport, we expressed tetanus toxin light chain (TNT) that cleaves synaptobrevin (nSyb) and
block the synaptic transmission [22]. The expression of UAS-TNT by SIFa-GAL4 results a loss
of both LMD and SMD, suggesting that the synaptic vesicle transport is required to drive both
LMD and SMD (The second panel in Fig. 1A).
Next, we manipulated the electrophysiological functions of SIFa-positive neurons by expressing
potassium channel KCNJ2 to constitutively hyperpolarize target neurons and found that only
LMD but not SMD was disrupted (The third panel in Fig. 1A). In contrast, when we
constitutively depolarized the same neurons by expressing bacterial sodium channel NachBacGFP, we found that only SMD but not LMD was disrupted (The last panel in Fig. 1A). Our
findings indicate that SIFa neurons acts as a ‘molecular switch’ between LMD and SMD since
the hyperpolarization of SIFa disrupts LMD whereas the depolarization disrupts SMD.
To confirm whether LMD and/or SMD are dependent on SIFa-mediated signaling through
SIFamide receptor (SIFaR), we used three different SIFaR-RNAi lines and determined the
efficacy of each line. We combined each RNAi line with pan-neuronal elav-GAL4 driver and
found a loss of both LMD and SMD in two of three SIFaR lines (Fig. 1B). Of those two lines, we
decided to use SIFaR-RNAi 34947 for future knockdown experiments.
To determine which subpopulations of SIFaR-positive cells are sufficient for LMD and/or SMD,
we selected four available SIFaR-GAL4 lines. Since each of the selected lines utilized different
fragments of the genomic DNA of the SIFaR promoter, it allows us to target different
subpopulations of SIFaR-positive cells [23]. Knockdown of SIFaR with all SIFaR-GAL4 drivers

can disrupt both LMD and SMD (Fig. 1C), suggesting that the expression of SIFaR in SIFaRGAL4 labeled cells are necessary for both LMD and SMD behaviours. Interestingly, knockdown
of SIFaR with SIFaR-GAL4 (49087) driver results longer mating duration in singly reared and in
experienced condition than naïve one (The third panel in Fig. 1C).
To determine which SIFaR-positive cells are sufficient for LMD and SMD, we designed genetic
rescue experiments using a mutant SIFaR (SIFaRB322) strain that are homozygous lethal. To
rescue the lethality and behaviour, we attempted to restore LMD and SMD by reintroducing the
wild type SIFaR gene into SIFaR mutant background using SIFaR-GAL4s. The results showed
that two of four SIFaR-GAL4 lines produced homozygous adults, suggesting that those two
GAL4 expressing cells (49061 and 49087) are essential for the lethality during development
(Table 1). We subsequently used both lines for mating duration assays and found that only
SIFaR-GAL4 49087 driver can rescue both LMD and SMD behaviour (Fig. 1D). These findings
suggest that SIFaR-GAL4 driver 49087 labels the cell populations that are necessary and
sufficient for both LMD and SMD behaviours via SIFa-SIFaR signaling pathway.
The bHLH transcription factor DIMMED has been associated with the differentiation of
peptidergic cells in Drosophila [24] and the most of the neuropeptidergic cells are labeled by
DIMM-GAL4. To confirm that SIFaR-positive cells are also neuropeptidergic cells that are
expressing specific neuropeptides, we knocked down SIFaR using DIMM-GAL4 strain and
found that only SMD disappears (Fig. 2A). This data suggests that SIFaR signaling in DIMMpositive cells are only required for SMD but not LMD behaviour.
Systematic GAL4 screening is a powerful method for investigating the relationship between the
subpopulation of cells and complex behaviours [25]. To identify potential candidate

neuropeptidergic neurons that express SIFaR which are required for LMD and/or SMD, we
conducted a neuropeptide-GAL4 screening using SIFaR-RNAi. We analyzed total 19 different
neuropeptide-GAL4 strains [26] and summarized the results in Table 2. In this screen, we found
that knockdown of SIFaR in proctolin-positive neurons disrupted both LMD and SMD,
knockdown of SIFaR in CAPA-, FMRFa-, and MS-positive neurons disrupts only LMD not
SMD, and knockdown of SIFaR in AKH-, AstA-, and LK-positive neurons disrupts only SMD
not LMD (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that three neuropeptides (CAPA, FMRFa, and MS) may
be only required for LMD which are DIMM-negative and three neuropeptides (AKH, AstA, and
LK) may be only required for SMD which are DIMM-positive.
To confirm whether the candidate neuropeptides are functionally important to regulate either
LMD and/or SMD, we knocked down candidate neuropeptide with proper RNAi in relevant
SIFaR-positive cells. In this screen, we used a total of 28 different candidate neuropeptide-RNAi
lines with SIFaR-GAL4 49087 driver and examined for changes in both LMD and SMD (Table
2). Our results show that seven neuropeptides identified through GAL4 screen are functionally
required for LMD and/or SMD behaviour (Fig. 2C). In summary, we functionally confirmed that
proctolin requires for both LMD and SMD behaviours, CAPA, FMRFa, and MS requires for
LMD but not SMD, and AKH, AstA, and LK requires for SMD but not LMD.
To visualize the candidate neurons expressing various neuropeptide and SIFaR together, we used
two independent binary systems, GAL4/UAS and LexA/LexAop [27]. Since neuropeptide
screening was conducted via GAL/UAS, we visualized SIFaR cells via LexA/LexAop system.
First, we performed experiments to confirm whether SIFaR-LexA expression pattern is same or
similar to SIFaR-GAL4 expression pattern. We expressed mCD8GFP via SIFaR-LexA and

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/819045; this version posted October 25, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

mCD8RFP via SIFaR-GAL4 and revealed similar morphology in central brain and few variations
in the VNC region (Fig. 3A). This finding demonstrates that the subpopulations of SIFaR cells
via LexA is suitable to recapitulate the results from previous SIFaR-GAL4 experiments.
Next, we visualized the expression pattern of SIFa-SIFaR signaling pathway to find out their
synaptic contacts. To do this, we labeled SIFaR-positive cells using the membrane marker
mCD8GFP via SIFaR-lexA and SIFa neurons using the mCD8RFP via SIFa-GAL4. Our findings
highlight extensive SIFa and SIFaR arborization in the medial central brain and VNC (Fig. 3B).
Interestingly, we identified an overlapping pattern restricted to the subesophageal ganglion
(SOG) region in the brain and to the superior region in the VNC which indicates potential
synapses (yellow arrows in Fig. 3B). This data indicates that SIFa neurons form multiple
synapses with SIFaR neurons in the brain and VNC.
To provide more evidence that the overlapping region by SIFa-GAL4 and SIFaR-lexA are
genuine synapses, we expressed dendritic marker DenMark and presynaptic marker sytGFP via
SIFa-GAL4 (Fig. 3C) or SIFaR-GAL4 (Fig. 3D). This data showed that SIFa-positive neurons
have extensive dendritic and axon terminals throughout the entire central brain including the
axon terminals in the lateral SOG region (green arrows in the Fig. 3C). In contrast, both of the
dendritic arborizations and axon terminals of SIFaR-positive cells concentrated near SOG,
especially in the central regions (green and red arrows in the Fig. 3D). We propose that a
principle signaling pathway that mediates LMD and SMD is likely modulated by synapses
formed with SIFa neurons with SIFaR-positive cells in central SOG region.
Next, we visualized the morphological distribution of each candidate neuropeptide-positive
neurons by expressing mCD8GFP via SIFaR-LexA and mCD8RFP via seven candidate

neuropeptide-GAL4s. For AstA, there is restricted bilalteral expression in central brain with
DIMM expression in inferior VNC region (red arrows in the Fig. S1A). We found that no
expression in AKH neurons in either central brain or VNC (Fig. S1B). Targeting CAPA neurons
revealed expression in central brain including the optic lobes, SOG, and VNC regions (Fig.
S1C). DIMM-positive CAPA neurons appear to be localized towards the medial superior VNC
region (red arrows in the Fig. S1C). Expression of FMRFa neurons are restricted towards the
optic lobe, SOG regions, and DIMM expression in VNC region (Fig. S1D). We found that
FMRFa-positive cells overlaps with SIFaR-positive cells in optice lobe and subsequent SOG
regions (yellow arrows Fig. S1D). For LK, we found expression in medial SOG region (Fig
S1E). Our immunostaining data showed one cell expresses both SIFaR and LK in the medial
SOG region (yellow arrow in Fig. S1E). For MS, we found some expression in the superior
lateral region near the optic lobe (Fig S1F) and found small number of cells that express both MS
and SIFaR in the optic lobe (yellow arrow in Fig. S1F). Finally, we found that proctolin-positive
cells strongly overlap with SIFaR-positive cells in the central and lateral SOG region (yellow
arrows in Fig. 3E), suggesting that proctolin is critical mediator of SIFa signaling that modulates
both LMD and SMD behaviours.
By visualizing neurons that express both SIFaR and candidate neuropeptides, we showed that
neuropeptide relay would be a critical way to modulate both LMD and SMD behaviours.
However, these data might represent the limitation of our genetic tools to capture all the SIFaRpositive cells using lexA system (non-overlapping regions in the Fig. 3A) since we could not
capture the overlapping neurons in the visualization process (Fig. S1). Constructing better
SIFaR-lexA strains that can cover the most of SIFaR-positive cells would help to identify the
further overlapping cells that express SIFaR and each candidate neuropeptide.

Discussion
In this study, we examined the association of SIFa-mediated signaling and its functional
relevance to male-specific mating behaviours, LMD and SMD in D. melanogaster. The
experiments reported here identify two pairs of bilateral SIFa neurons in the pars intercerebralis
of the adult brain are critical to switch between LMD or SMD behaviours (Fig. 1). We also
found that SIFaR expression in SIFaR-GAL4s labled cells are critical for both LMD and SMD
behaviours (Fig. 1). Intriguingly, SIFaR cells which are DIMM-positive are essential for LMD
whereas SIFaR cells which are DIMM-negative are important for SMD (Fig. 2). We also
performed neuropeptide GAL4- based screen to identify the SIFaR-expressing neuropeptidergic
neurons which can mediate neuropeptide relay for each behaviour (Fig. 2 and Table 2). We
found seven neuropeptide-positive neurons as well as neuropeptide themselves are involved in
LMD and SMD behaviours through RNAi screens (Fig. 2 and Table 2). Finally, we conducted an
anatomical-based screen to identify which candidate neuropeptides are co-labelled with SIFaR
and found three pairs of bilaterally proctolin neurons in the SOG, which indicate that these cells
receive specific neuropeptidegic input from SIFa that modulate both LMD and SMD and send
output signals to further modulate LMD and SMD behaviours (Fig. 3). We also identified SIFaRpositive neuropeptide-expressing cells in FMRFa, LK, and MS (Fig. S1) We propose that SIFamediated signaling through different neuropeptidergic cells can provide an excellent model to
describe the molecular mechanisms that how the neuropeptide relay modulate complex
behaviours.
Previous studies have reported a link between SIFa and interval timing behaviours [12,28], but
no prior studies have identified a direct connection to mating duration. Our study showed that

depolarizing SIFa neurons initiates LMD while hyperpolarizing displays SMD. This is the first
evidence providing a causal link between LMD and SMD whereby SIFa neurons modifies its
intrinsic cellular properties in accordance to extrinsic factors such as socio-sexual conditions. We
also report that knockdown or eliminating synaptic vesicle exocytosis with TNT blocker [22] in
SIFa neurons disrupted both LMD and SMD which suggests that the neuropeptide itself is also
essential. Moreover, we showed that neuropeptide relay via SIFa-SIFaR signaling is specifically
involved in switching LMD and SMD behaviours.
Neuropeptide relay are fundamental for survival and goal-oriented behaviours. One apparent
case is the balance between appetite and satiety via orexigenic and anorexigenic neuronal
circuits. Appetitive signals activate specific sensory neurons that then turn on a cascade of neural
connections that initiate and maintain stereotyped behaviours such as feeding. Persistent feeding
behaviour induced by appetite then induce production of satiety signals that, in turn activates a
cascade of neural circuits to induce stereotyped opposing behaviours such as eating cessation.
The nodes of those neural circuits activated either by appetite or satiety signals presumably
inhibit each other at some level to facilitate sharply delineated behavioural outcomes. It has been
known that neuropeptides and hormones are important neural substrates for modulating appetite
and satiety control [6,29]. SIFa has been known as a central modulator in parallel inhibition
between orexigenic and anorexigenic pathways. By acute activation in SIFa neurons, non-starved
flies act starve-like and enhance their food intake. Interestingly, SIFa integrates orexigenic
signals from myoinhibitory peptide neurons and anorexigenic signals from Hugin-pyrokinin
neurons to mediate satiety and hunger [12]. This report suggests that SIFa neurons are important
to recruiting compensatory pathways via other neuropeptides to facilitate hunger-driven
behaviour.

In another study, SIFa-mediated signaling facilitates sleep functions in the pars intercerebralis
[20], possibly through diuretic hormone 44 neurons [30]. Therefore, SIFa neurons does not act
independently, but rather coordinates its activity collectively in response to other neuropeptides
dependent of the behaviours it modulates. We believe that this integration of neuropeptidergic
signaling towards SIFa may also account for the time delay in our mating paradigms. LMD and
SMD utilizes PDF, NPF, and sNPF signaling which requires long but lasting effects to activate
their corresponding receptors [31], this coincides with the one day delay to elicit either LMD or
SMD [13–15]. To elucidate how this mechanism might occur, further studies will be required to
understand the interactions between PDF/NPF and sNPF to SIFa neurons.
Here, we found that knockdown of SIFaR through SIFaR-GAL4 (49087) driver-labeled cells
display increased mating duration in singly reared and in experienced reared than naïve
condition, thus representing a possible neuronal disinhibition circuit. In Drosophila, behavioural
disinhibition has been observed in the mushroom body (MB) αβ and γ neurons [32] via MB247GAL4 [33]. Our previous work revealed that neuronal activity from OK107-GAL4 driver-labeled
MB cells are required for SMD. OK107-GAL4 neurons appear to overlap with αβ and γ neurons
[34], hence may play a role in our underlying disinhibition circuit. MB cells expressed by
OK107-GAL4 driver are cholinergic [35] and converge to MB output neurons (MBONs) which
have afferent dopaminergic neurons (DANs) [36,37]. At OK107-MBONs synapses, sNPF
potentiates Ach-evoked response in MBONs which has significant effects for odor-associated
memory formation [35]. This is important for our paradigm as SMD is highly dependent on
previous mating or prior learning experiences. Modulation of this circuit might further be
adjusted by DANs. Interfering with dopaminergic signaling induces disinhibition [32,33], thus it

is conceivable that target neurons may also express SIFaR. When constitutively activating these
central neurons, this mediates pleiotropic effects or disinhibition as seen in our observations.
Our findings also report that bHLH transcription factor DIMM is essential to modulate SMD but
not LMD. We also show that all candidate neuropeptides to be DIMM-positive and distributed
throughout the entire nervous system. DIMM is expressed by large cells that show episodic
release of amidated peptides (LEAPs) [24]. It remains to be seen how SMD might be modulated
by one or all DIMM-positive neuropeptides, but we propose that insulin producing cells (IPCs)
interact with AKH, AstA, and LK to mediate SMD (Fig 4.)
Previous studies have described two types of LK neurons, lateral horn leucokinin (LHLK) and
subesophageal ganglion leucokinin (SELK) neurons. LHLKs are linked with locomotor activity,
metabolism, and sleep [38] but its distinct role is still unspecified. In one study, an increased in
growth was observed in DIMM-positive LHLK neurons which are controlled by Drosophila
insulin receptor via insulin/IGF signaling in adult flies [39] and interact with IPCs [40]. Our
results selectively targeted LHLK neurons with our DIMM and LK knockdown result on SMD,
thereby may indicate a novel function in LHLK-IPC interactions (Fig. 2 and 3). Conversely, our
expression data indicates that SELKs modulate SMD via SIFaR and may relay the signal towards
the IPC (Fig. S1). There are no reports of synaptic contact between these IPCs and SELKS [41],
suggesting that LK influences IPCs in a paracrine manner. However, the IPCs are in synaptic
contact with LHLKs [41] and are also modulated by octopamine [42], serotonin [40], and sNPF
where its dendrites branch to the pars intercerebralis and tritocerebrum and axonal terminals in
the corpora cardiac and anterior aorta and midgut region [43]. Interestingly, we previously found
one sNPF neuron localized as dorsolateral peptidergic neurons (DLPs) to be robustly active in

experience males [15], these DLPs are also thought to regulate IPC activity [43]. Though
mechanistic evidence is lacking, we propose that IPCs interacts with both LHLKs and/or SELKs
and contributes to integrating modulatory effects from other neuropeptidergic pathways to elicit
SMD.
SMD behaviour may also be mediated by AKH and AstA acting on IPC circuits. AKH regulates
energy storage homeostasis by mobilizing glucose and lipids while Drosophila insulin-like
peptide (DILPs) is involved glucose metabolism [44]. When functioning together, they modulate
glucose sensitivity for various behaviours including feeding [45], foraging [46], and sexual
attractiveness [47]. Insulin signaling acts through AKH Receptors (AKHRs) which are expressed
are also found in Gr5a gustatory neurons [44]. Our findings report that male flies deficient for
AKH in SIFaR-GAL4 labelled cells had disrupted SMD behaviour. As AKH co-activates with
insulin-like peptides to regulate glucose and lipid metabolism [48], we infer that AKH adjusts
the dynamic balance of glucose levels in sensory Gr5a neurons. In fruit flies, memory can be
reinforced up to several days when specific odors are paired with glucose [49]. We believe that
the memory system required for SMD is interrupted and the male flies are no longer primed for
this behaviour. This process is also facilitated through AstA-AKH interactions to maintain the
dynamic balance of glucose. AstA is a neuropeptide involved in a series of satiety signals such as
feeding, metabolism, and sugar reward [50–52]. Its receptor, Allatostatn A Receptor (AstAR), is
expressed in both insulin and AKH cells. When silencing AstAR cells, AKH signaling was
reduced which thus accumulated high lipid levels [51]. The authors claim that AstA is involved
in nutrient homeostasis by controlling metabolism and feeding decisions [51]. In our case,
downregulation of AstA in SIFaR-GAL4 labelled cells disrupted the metabolic balance that

maintains glucose ratios through both IPCs and AKH signaling. This subsequently interrupts
sensory integration to the appropriate systems and thereby inhibits SMD behaviour.
We propose that SMD signaling recruits neuronal circuits within this network via AKH, AstA,
and LK by SIFaR to elicit this behaviour. In contrast, LMD appears to be solely independent of
this pathway where it employs specialized microcircuits through CAPA and FMRFa to display
this behaviour. In summary, our findings highlight a potential novel signaling mechanism where
SIFa-mediated neuropeptide relay is required to modulate both LMD and SMD. Our study will
help to investigate the mechanisms how does neuropeptide relay modulate specific behaviours.

Figure 1. SIFamide signaling is required for both LMD and SMD behaviour. (A) SIFa
modulates the activation between both LMD and SMD male behaviour. Downregulation of SIFa
in elav-positive cells displayed a disruption in both LMD and SMD. Insertion of synaptic
blocker, TNT, in SIFa neurons disrupted both LMD and SMD. Preventing membrane
depolarization via KCNJ2 disrupted LMD but not SMD. Increasing sodium conductance via
NaChBac disrupted SMD but not LMD. (B) Distinct SIFaR-RNAi expression in neuronalspecific tissue disrupts both LMD and SMD. SIFaR-RNAi 25831 and 34947 but not 44068
effector lines disrupted both LMD and SMD. (C) Knockdown using SIFaR-RNAi in different
subsets of SIFaR-positve cells disrupts both LMD and SMD. Downregulation of SIFaR in
SIFaR-GAL4 49041, 49061, 49087, and 46391 driver lines disrupted LMD and SMD. (D) LMD
and SMD was rescued using SIFaR-GAL4 49087 in SIFaRB322 mutant phenotype. (A-D) Each

Fig 4. Proposed pathway where AKH, AstA, and LK modulates SMD through DIMM. Our
proposition includes that SMD behaviour is driven by a current hunger-driven circuit that
becomes incorporated into mating duration-specific behaviour. The mechanism is unknown but
all of our neuropeptides that modulates SMD are potentially DIMM-positive.

screens used SIFaR-RNAi (34947) crossed with different neuropeptide-GAL4 drivers. The
second screens used SIFaR-GAL4 (49087) crossed with neuropeptide-RNAi strains. The results
show that LMD and/or SMD are intact (marked with *, **, ***) or disrupted (n.s). No data
suggests that the crosses were lethal or males could not succeed copulation thus mating duration
