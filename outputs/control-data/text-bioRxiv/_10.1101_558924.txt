Abstract
Genetic engineering combined with CRISPR technology has developed to the point
that gene drives can, in theory, be engineered to cause extinction in countless
species. Success of extinction programs now rests on the possibility of resistance
evolution, which is largely unknown. For CRISPR technology, resistance may take
many forms, from mutations in the nuclease target sequence to specific types of
non-random population structures that limit the drive. We develop mathematical models of various deviations from random mating to consider escapes from
extinction-causing gene drives. We use a version of Maynard Smith’s haystack

model to show that population structure can enable drive-free subpopulations to
be maintained against gene drives. Our main emphasis, however, is sib mating in
the face of recessive-lethal and Y-chromosome drives. Sib mating easily evolves in
response to both kinds of gene drives and maintains mean fitness above 0, with
equilibrium fitness depending on the level of inbreeding depression. Environmental
determination of sib mating (as might stem from population density crashes) can
also maintain mean fitness above 0. Translation of mean fitness into population
size depends on ecological details, so understanding mean fitness evolution and dynamics is merely the first step in predicting extinction. Nonetheless, these results
point to possible escapes from gene drive-mediated extinctions that lie beyond the
control of genome engineering.

Introduction

Engineered gene drives offer an exciting new technology for the possible control of
pests and vector-borne diseases, and which might even be used to rescue wildlife species
from the edge of extinction. The selective advantage of some drives is so powerful that
they can be used to cause species extinction, but many potential applications propose
using them more benignly, to deliver a harmless genetic cargo throughout a species.
It seems paradoxical that natural selection can favor genes that cause extinction,
but the theory indicating such possibilities is over half a century old (Prout, 1953;
Bruck, 1957; Lewontin, 1958; Hamilton, 1967). Engineering to implement these systems
remained the challenge for decades, but the insight of Burt (2003) combined with
CRISPR technology has led to a revolution in interest (Sinkins and Gould, 2006; Gould,
2008; Burt, 2014; Esvelt et al., 2014; Unckless et al., 2015); laboratory experiments have
now shown the feasibility of various implementations (Akbari et al., 2013; Gantz and
Bier, 2015; Kyrou et al., 2018).
The pace at which engineering methods have enabled gene drive construction has
vastly exceeded our experience with implementations, so that we stand poised to
introduce gene drives on a massive scale without appreciating how they might fail or
deviate from expectations. Given the demonstrated success of engineered gene drives in
experimental populations, the most obvious basis of possible failure now becomes the
evolution of resistance, the focus of this paper. At a minimum, resistance would limit
coverage of the population by a gene drive; at worst, resistance would fully reverse a
drive’s effect. Furthermore, the evolution of resistance to one implementation may
thwart subsequent implementations, so early failures may have long-term ramifications

for later interventions. There is thus an imperative to understand resistance evolution
before implementing gene drives on a wide scale.
Resistance may take many forms. Some forms may be specific to the mechanistic
underpinnings of the gene drive implementation, others may operate largely
independent of the drive mechanism. For a homing endonuclease gene, an obvious form
of resistance is mutation in the target sequence recognized by the nuclease (Burt, 2003).
Resistance that, at a molecular level, blocks gene drive expression or interferes with its
operation will be difficult to predict or study except empirically, in the context of
specific applications. Other types of resistance, especially those that transcend
mechanistic details of the drive, may be more amenable to a priori analysis.
Here we specifically consider population structure as a foundation for resistance –
how specific types of non-random mating will work and evolve to thwart
extinction-causing gene drives, which entail the strongest selection for resistance. We
develop two classes of models. The first is a metapopulation model with simplified
dynamics regulating local extinctions (from a gene drive), recolonization, and
interactions between drive and non-drive populations. It is merely a modified version of
Maynard Smith’s original haystack model (Maynard Smith, 1964). The second class
allows sib mating in response to a gene drive introduction. We compare the effects of
sib mating and its evolution for both Y-chromosome gene drive, which does not kill
individuals, and for recessive-lethal gene drive, which does kill. Sib mating evolves in
response to both types of gene drive, partially or completely blocking the drive, but the
outcomes differ quantitatively between the two types of drive. We also consider
non-evolutionary forms of sib mating that may thwart a drive through effects on
population structure.

Consequences of extreme population structure:
the haystack model revisited

Many intended uses of gene drives rely on the drive suppressing or even
extinguishing populations. The populations most suited to this end are unstructured
with random-mating. As is well known from the decades-old theoretical literature on
group selection of cooperative (altruistic) traits, a structured population is protected
against selfish elements, and the degree of protection depending on quantitative details
of fitness effects, migration rates, and group extinction rates (Williams, 1966; Coyne
et al., 1997; Leigh, 2010). When the selfish element is a lethal gene drive, it accelerates
extinction of the subpopulations in which it resides, but the then-empty patches are

recolonized disproportionately by the altruists lacking the selfish element.
To illustrate this process in a highly simplified but intuitively tractable form, we
modify the original haystack model of Maynard Smith (Maynard Smith, 1964), with
parallels to Hamilton and May’s dispersal model (Hamilton and May, 1977). We
imagine many small populations, each inhabiting patches (islands) in a large habitat of
many patch sites; i.e., a metapopulation (Fig. 1). Migrants from one population can
colonize other sites. There are two types of populations: those consisting purely of
wild-type individuals (B, for beneficial) and those with at least some gene-drive
individuals (S, for selfish). In the spirit of the haystack model, gene drive spread within
a local population is considered so rapid that any patch with even a few gene drive
individuals is immediately converted to type S. This separation of time scales is an
essential feature of metapopulation models and allows for a consolidation of state
variables. Although migrants from B cannot convert S populations and thus can be
ignored, the reverse migration (rate βSB ) is highly effective because of the gene drive
effect. Furthermore, high values of βSB represent a near absence of population structure.
The model does not specifically include or even require genetics, the key within-patch
process being the rapid takeover of B patches by S individuals when they invade B.
Differential equations describing the dynamics are presented in equations (1),
with variables and parameters defined in table 1.

Stability conditions imply that Ŝ2 > 0 is required for S to invade. Systematically testing
which values satisfy (3) across the range of (0.01, 2.02) for all 5 parameters (and when
the parameter constraints are met), approximately 15% of the parameter space allows B
and S coexistence; for the other 85%, S simply cannot invade. S cannot drive B extinct
with these deterministic processes because there is always a threshold value of S below
which B is so unaffected by S (by low colonization) that it persists. However, a choice of
βSB sufficiently high can push the equilibrium value of B to such a low value that B
would not persist in any habitat with a finite number of patches.
Although the haystack model was originally used for insight about group
selection, our version here is probably better thought of in the usual metapopulation
sense as a model of implicit spatial structure. The resulting spatial segregation is
enough to allow coexistence of B and S (under appropriate conditions on the
parameters). What fraction of natural populations satisfy the structural requisites to
contain a gene drive by local extinction remains to be seen. However, North et al.
(2013) simulated an extinction-causing gene drive in a spatial population with many
details specific to mosquito biology. They found that small patches of mosquitoes could
escape the extinction wave, suggestive of the patch model here.

Sib mating

Groups per se aren’t the only structures that may operate to thwart an
extinguishing gene drive. Structure may exist at the family level in the form of
inbreeding. A previous theoretical study found that selfing can be selected in response
to a recessive lethal gene drive and that selfing limits the potential for extinction of the
population targeted by the drive (Bull, 2016). This result is worrying for gene drive
implementations, but there were two hopeful outcomes from that work. First, although
evolution of even partial selfing could prevent gene drive fixation, mean fitness of the
targeted population was limited by the magnitude of inbreeding depression. Thus, mean
fitness remained low if inbreeding depression was high, preserving much of the intended
effect of the gene drive. Second, selfing could sometimes only evolve by major
mutations, not small ones. That study considered only recessive lethal drive, and the
latter result was evaluated only for the case of drive in one sex only. We thus expand
upon that work here to address two questions for a different form of inbreeding: (i)
Does sib mating also evolve as a block to extinguishing gene drives, and can it evolve in
small steps? (ii) Do recessive lethal drives and Y-drives equally favor sib mating?
All models assume a life cycle with sexual haploids: male and female parents
mate and produce a brief diploid phase, which then undergoes meiosis to produce

haploid offspring. Gene drive operates in the diploid phase (regardless of which parent
contributes the drive allele in the recessive-lethal model). Drive is always complete,
with 100% of the progeny receiving the drive allele. The locus controlling sib mating
has 2 alleles and is unlinked to the drive locus.

Genotypes and phenotypes
For models with genetic control of sib mating, the family’s level of sib mating is
controlled by the mother’s genotype at the A/a locus (Table 2). Sib mating is limited
to families that produce both sexes; with Y-drive, some families are all sons with no
sisters to mate. In all trials illustrated here, sib mating in allele ‘a’ was set to 0 – purely
outcrossing – and ‘A’ provided some sib mating.

A non-genetic (‘ecological’) class of models tested here allows the level of sib
mating to change dynamically with mean fitness (w ≤ 1). The biological justification is
that, as mean fitness declines, so will population density, and siblings may increasingly
provide the only potential mates. Here, there is no genetic variation for sib mating (all
genotypes are ’a’ or, equivalently, sa = sA ), and we used an exponential sib-mating
function with a single parameter (c) to control steepness:
e−c w − e−c
sa =
1 − e−c

Drive genetics
Two models of drive are studied. Recessive-lethal drive (alleles D/d) operates so
that if either (but only one) parent carries D, all offspring inherit D. If both parents
carry D, no offspring are produced. That is, D is a recessive lethal only in the brief
diploid phase. For the model of Y drive, all females carry X, but males carry either Y
or Z chromosome. Of a male that carries Y, half his offspring inherit the Y and half
inherit the mother’s X. Of a male that carries Z, all his offspring inherit the Z and are
thus sons in a brood with no sisters, and hence no possibility of sib mating.

Inbreeding depression
The models assume that the relative brood size of parents who are sibs is σ,
typically lower than that of outcrossed offspring (σ < 1). (Inbreeding depression would
be represented as the decrement in fitness, δ = 1 − σ.) Inbreeding depression is assumed
to be invariant throughout the evolutionary process. In real systems, inbreeding
depression is often partially purged upon extended inbreeding, but allowing inbreeding
depression to be static is a reasonable starting point and, if anything, provides a
conservative measure of the vulnerability of gene drive systems to be suppressed by
inbreeding.

Male reproductive versatility
The net reproductive output of sons from a family with sib mating can be
modeled in different ways, each of which may be observed in nature. At one extreme,
sons who mate their sisters may then go on to join the random mating pool with no
adverse consequence to their abilities in the outcrossing pool. At the other extreme,
sons who mate their sisters are forever lost to the outcrossing pool, as if there is a brief
time in which all mating occurs and an individual can be at only one place during that
time. This latter process, of sons being ‘discounted,’ is conveniently represented by
assuming the extreme case that the fraction of a family’s sons lost to the outcrossing
pool is the same as the fraction of daughters mated by sons. We use K to represent the
probability that a sister-mating male also participates in the random-mating pool.

Four models
The preceding account has identified two fundamental biological differences that
require specific models:
(a) The allele with drive is an autosomal recessive lethal or a Y (Z) chromosome
(b) Sib mating is controlled genetically or ecologically.
Addressing these variables in all combinations, there are four models to study.
Equations are given in the Appendix; all models consist of difference equations that
assume discrete generations. Drive was assumed to be complete in all cases.

Recessive lethal drive
Genetic control of sib mating
There are minimally 16 viable family types that must be counted: 4 initiated
from sib mating, 12 from outcrossing (Appendix; formally, there are 20 mating types,
but 4 produce no progeny). The drive allele (D) is present in 8 of the outcrossed family
types, and for these families, all progeny carry D so any sib mating is non-productive.
Sib-mating rates depend on the mother’s genotype at the a/A locus, and the rate of sib
mating induced by ‘A’ was varied systematically in different trials. Both the drive allele
D and sib-mating allele A were introduced at low frequency at the beginning of each
trial. Sib mating rates were unaffected by the presence of D in the brood, so D led to
offspring death from sib mating.
Equilibrium. We describe equilibrium outcomes based on mean fitness, which in
our case is the average number of daughters per mother within a generation – all
daughters are assumed to be mated. (For the equations in the Appendix, this
calculation is w(t) when b = 2.) These numerical studies revealed that the sib mating
allele always evolved, even when it effected only a small level of sib mating (e.g.,
sA = 0.01). However, average fitness at equilibrium was strongly dependent on the
magnitude of sib mating encoded by allele ‘A’ up to a value of sA = 0.5 (fig. 3). With
sA < 0.5, allele ‘A’ fixed and mean fitness remained below σ. If instead, sA > 0.5, allele
‘A’ remained polymorphic, and mean fitness equalled σ. In all cases, mean fitness was
bounded by σ, the fraction of maximum brood size attained with parents who were
sibs.)
The foregoing results apply to complete male discounting (K = 0 – males who
mate their sisters are lost to the random pool). In the absence of male discounting,
mean fitness was observed to exceed σ when sA > 0.5, but the largest mean fitness
observed was 1.3σ, and the effect diminished as σ increased above 0.5. In comparison to
the case of complete male discounting, a higher mean fitness with no male discounting
is understandable because of the male fitness gained when sib-mating males later join
the random mating pool.
The main qualitative result is that, although sib mating evolves in response to a
lethal gene drive, mean fitness is approximately bounded by the fitness consequences of
sib mating (σ) and also somewhat bounded by the magnitude of sib mating allowed by
the genetics.

Figure 3: Equilibrium properties for the genetic control of sib mating with recessive lethal
drive. The horizontal axis in all panels is sA , the probability of sib-mating for allele ’A’.
All three panels are for the same runs, merely illustrating different properties. (Left)
Relative mean fitness attained across different sA values. W /σ is mean fitness scaled by
the fraction of maximum brood size attained by parents who were sibs. That this ratio
was never observed to exceed one means that σ sets the upper limit on mean fitness. The
shaded area shows the region in which the sib-mating allele (A) remained polymorphic.
The dashed gray line is an isocline at which the y-value equals the x-value. (Middle)
Equilibrium frequency of allele ’A’. The allele invariably fixes for sA values up to 0.5, but
remains polymorphic at higher sA values. The value of σ has little effect on the frequency.
(Right) Equilibrium frequency of the drive allele, D, for different sA values. Except at the
extremes of no sib mating and complete sib mating, the final frequency of D is strongly
affected by both sA and σ. These runs assumed full male discounting (K = 0).
Ecological adjustment of sib mating
In this model, all evolution is limited to the drive locus because genetic variation
in sib mating is not required when the level of sib mating increases ‘ecologically.’ We
assumed that sib mating increases as mean fitness declines (fig. 4, left).
The evolutionary dynamics are intuitive: the drive allele spreads and depresses
mean fitness, thereby increasing sib mating. The increase in sib mating affects spread of
the drive allele, thereby limiting further drops in mean fitness or possibly increasing
mean fitness. A balance may be reached – dynamic equilibrium – or oscillations may
result (fig. 4). The shape of the sib mating function is critical both to the equilibrium
as well as to the outcome of oscillations versus static equilibrium. Mean fitness depends
heavily on the shape of the sib-mating function and again on σ – the fitness of inbred
progeny.

Equilibrium outcomes for three different trials of the ecological sib mating model with a
recessive lethal drive. The output shown spans 50 generations following following more
than 1000 initial generations. Note that W /σ does even closely not approach 1 (this ratio
must be inferred from the graph), but the ratio depends on σ and on the shape of the
sib-mating function. Full male discounting was assumed (K = 0).

Y drive
Genetic control of sib mating
The model setup is similar in many ways to that of recessive lethal drive (Fig. 5).
There are 4 types of sib mated families and 8 types of outcrossed families. The Y drive
allele (Z chromosome) is present in four types of outcrossed families, and as those
families produce only sons, there is no opportunity for sib mating. All sons carrying the
Z allele join the outcrossing pool.
Equilibrium. As with recessive lethal drive, sib mating was found to evolve
under Y drive, the details differing somewhat from the case of recessive lethal drive. For
example, allele ‘A’ always evolved to fixation (allele ‘a’ was for strict outcrossing).
Mean fitness relative to σ closely paralleled the sib mating level (fig. 6). (Mean fitness
was calculated the same as for recessive lethal drive.)

Ecological control of sib mating
Qualitatively similar results were obtained for ecological control of sib mating
when assuming Y drive as when assuming recessive lethal drive. Oscillations appeared
to require even more extreme deviations from linearity in the sib mating function under

Figure 6: Genetic control of sib mating with Y (Z) chromosome drive: equilibrium. The
horizontal axis in all panels is sA , the probability of sib-mating for allele ’A’. All three
panels are for the same trials, merely illustrating different properties. (Left) Relative
mean fitness attained across different sA values. W /σ is mean fitness scaled by the
fraction of maximum brood size attained by parents who were sibs. That this ratio was
never observed to exceed one means that σ sets the upper limit on mean fitness, but in
contrast to recessive lethal drive, here W /σ closely parallels sA and never equals 1 except
at sA = 1. The dashed gray line is an isocline at which the y-value equals the x-value.
(Middle) Equilibrium frequency of allele ’A’. In contrast to recessive lethal drive, the ’A’
allele always fixed. (Right) Equilibrium frequency of the drive allele, Z, closely follows
1 − sA . Trials assumed full male discounting (K = 0).
Y drive as under recessive lethal drive. Mean fitness remained well short of σ, even with
a nearly linear function.

Dynamics of all cases
Results described above are for long-term, equilibrium behavior. Short-term dynamics
are of interest to understand how and how quickly equilibrium is attained. Fig. 7 shows
representative dynamics from a single trial of each of the four classes of models. The
most significant result is that genetic evolution of resistance experiences a large crash in
mean fitness when the drive initially sweeps. This crash is due to the low initial
frequency of the sib-mating ’A’ allele, and the rebound in mean fitness is rapid.
Nonetheless, the nadir in mean fitness is a vulnerability to extinction. Populations with
the environmental inbreeding function do not experience this crash.

Discussion

The intentional engineering of gene drives has become so feasible that this
intervention can be entertained for nearly any sexual plant or animal species. The two
most basic possible uses of a gene drive system are to drag a genetic cargo through a
population (with potentially little fitness consequence) or to suppress population
reproduction, possibly to extinction. Extinction is the most profound and far-reaching
of these applications, and it is also the most likely to select resistance.
Resistance evolution to block an intentional gene drive release will nearly always
be undesirable, except perhaps in limiting the drive’s spread beyond the intended
species. Even so, some types of resistance evolution will be far more undesirable than
others, as some types of resistance will block future efforts that use the same or related
technology.
Three classes of resistance evolution can be anticipated:
(R1) Resistance blocks the mechanism or action of the drive; with CRISPR, this
resistance could involve changes in the nuclease target sequence, could block
CRISPR expression, or interfere with the CRISPR RNA/protein complex.
(R2) Resistance may not interfere with the drive but merely compensate for its effects.
Lyttle (1981) observed a change in Drosophila sex determination that tolerated
the Y chromosome in both sexes and thus blocked the effect of a driving Y
chromosome without blocking the drive. Burt (2003) noted that the effects of a
recessive lethal drive could be abrogated by compensatory evolution in a different
gene that assumed the function of the targeted gene.
(R3) As studied here, resistance may alter the mating structure of the population,
protecting subsets of individuals from invasion by the driving element.
Type R1 underlies many mathematical models of resistance evolution, in that the
resistant allele segregates opposite the drive allele (Burt 2003; Deredec, Burt, and
Godfray 2008; Unckless, Clark, and Messer 2017). Type R1 resistance seemed like an
inevitable outcome of lethal gene drive efforts using CRISPR (Champer et al. 2017;
Drury et al. 2017), although the deployment of multiple guide RNAs to several targets
at once was a possible bypass (Burt, 2003). However, a recent study identified a target
sequence in mosquitoes that is both essential and apparently intolerant of change:
caged populations of several hundred mosquitoes did not evolve resistance, instead
going extinct (Kyrou et al. 2018). Mutations in the target sequence were observed at
some life cycle stages, likely a consequence of imperfect repair of DNA lesions, but they
were incompatible with fertility and thus did not evolve.

The potential for resistance – and types of resistance – will depend on the design
of a drive system, as shown at least by Kyrou et al. (2018). The choice of a target
sequence is obviously important. Some expression constructs may be more easily
blocked than others. In addition, drives with cargo may be prone to lose the cargo,
thereby introducing a secondary drive that competes with the original design but fails
to provide the desired properties. Drives may even be engineered in various ways to
prey on other drives, creating a type of arms race that will prevent any one from
spreading throughout the population (Gantz and Bier, 2016).
The type of resistance that evolves has consequences beyond the immediate gene
drive implementation. Specifically, there are different degrees to which resistance will be
independent of the molecular mechanism of a gene drive. If resistance is a change in
target sequence, that resistance will not affect drives that use other target sites. In
contrast, resistance that is somewhat independent of the drive implementation may
block future gene drive implementations that target other sites. Thus, resistance in the
form of inbreeding and other changes in mating structure will block
population-suppressing drives regardless of the technology. Inbreeding that is only
partial may remain effective in limiting future population-suppressing drives but still
allow the spread of harmless, cargo-carrying drives. The downside of any evolution of
resistance that prevents extinction, even one in which mean fitness remains low, is that
it provides a population nucleus in which further evolution of resistance may occur.
Following evolution of inbreeding that even partially rescues, subsequent evolution
could be of reduced inbreeding depression (Porcher and Lande, 2005; Charlesworth and
Willis, 2009; Porcher and Lande, 2013) or could be other classes of resistance. Being
non-essential, CRISPR may be especially prone to suppression in the long term. Rapid
extinction may be the only hope for a persistent suppression.
The results here indicate that evolution of sib mating is a threat to an
extinction-causing gene drive. Evolution of inbreeding is not assured, and its evolution
is far more complicated than is evolution of a change in the target sequence. Even if
inbreeding does evolve, the recovery of mean fitness is approximately limited by the
magnitude of inbreeding depression. However, other forms of inbreeding are
theoretically possible (e.g. Crow and Kimura, 1970), and some of these may be less
affected by inbreeding depression than is sib mating.

Anomalies in the theory
A previous theoretical analysis of the evolution of selfing in response to a lethal
gene drive observed that selfing was favored only if the selfing allele enacted a

17

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/558924; this version posted February 22, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

sufficiently large degree of selfing (Bull, 2016). That was an encouraging result in
suggesting that selfing could not evolve gradually. But that result was demonstrated for
models of a recessive lethal drive in which drive was limited to one sex (and was not
evaluated for models of drive in both sexes). None of the results here support that
outcome.
Further numerical studies of those selfing models (conducted for the current
study) suggest that the block to gradual evolution of selfing is due to a combination of
(i) recessive lethal drive, and (ii) incomplete drive (e.g., drive operating only in one sex,
or the segregation distortion of the drive being less than 100%). An intuitive argument
for that previous result and for our failure to observe it in the present recessive-lethal
model analyses is as follows: when a drive distortion is complete, any mating in which
one parent carries the drive allele produces a family in which every offspring carries the
drive allele. The alleles for inbreeding in this family never return to the pool of
genotypes that lack drive. But when drive is incomplete, a mating in which one parent
carries the drive allele sometimes produces descendants that do not carry the drive
allele, and they or their descendants can then return to the drive-free pool and influence
the frequency of alleles for inbreeding. In such families, an allele that imposes a low
level of inbreeding will return more progeny to the drive-free pool than does an allele
that imposes a high level of inbreeding – because the drive allele is a recessive lethal.
Thus, an incomplete drive partly selects against inbreeding by disproportionately
returning low-inbreeding alleles back to the drive-free pool of genotypes.
We conjecture that similar arguments apply to some of the differences in
evolutionary dynamics observed here between Y drive and recessive lethal drive (e.g.,
comparing figs 3 and 6). In particular, the mating between a parent carrying a recessive
lethal drive allele and an allele for high inbreeding kills grandchildren from the
inbreeding, whereas there is no such killing of grandchildren with Y drive. This
asymmetry may explain why the sib-mating allele always fixes with Y drive but not
always with recessive-lethal drive.

Extinction
The models in this study are strictly of population genetics and do not account
for population size. Yet the motivation for this work is to understand resistance that
blocks extinction. Inferring extinction from mean fitness requires insight to ecology –
fecundity, the nature of population regulation, Allele effects at low density, and so on.
Predicting extinction will thus face many challenges beyond merely predicting
resistance evolution. These difficulties are foreshadowed by a 1977 symposium on the

18

evolution of resistance to the US implementation of the sterile insect technique against
the screw worm (Richardson, 1979). The program had suffered a recent rebound in
screw worm cases, and various forms of resistance evolution were entertained to
anticipate a long term failure of the program. In the final analysis, the rebound was
apparently due chiefly to factory evolution of the strains used for release; replacement of
those strains in rearing facilities was adequate to restore program efficacy and led to
ultimate eradication from North and Central America. Resistance evolution did not
prevent program success despite the plausibility of various possible avenues of failure.
Yet even if predicting resistance evolution proves elusive, an understanding of
how resistance might evolve makes it possible to take steps to identify the best
candidate species for release and to ensure that failures of the first efforts do not thwart
later efforts. Experience with the sterile insect technique led to the realization that
some species characteristics were more prone to success than others (Klassen and
Curtis, 2005; Itô and Yamamura, 2005). We can likewise suggest a few characteristics
that should facilitate extinction by gene drive:
1 High inbreeding depression. If sib mating evolves, the fitness recovery is limited
by inbreeding depression. Species with high inbreeding depression, and also for
which inbreeding depression is slow to reverse on extended inbreeding, should face
difficulty in escaping extinction through inbreeding evolution. Magnitudes of
inbreeding depression are easily studied experimentally with any species that can
be housed artificially, so species anticipated as targets of extinction-causing gene
drives might be screened in advance to decide on the feasibility of inbreeding
evolution.
2 Low fecundity. Declines in mean fitness have a greater impact in suppressing
numbers of individuals when females produce few offspring than when they
produce many. The nature of population regulation also enters into this effect.
3 Small population size or low density. Opportunities for resistance mutations
should be fewer in small populations, and mating opportunities of any resistant
individuals should also decline with population density. This principle was an
important one behind success of the sterile insect technique.
4 Intrinsic outbreeding. Some life histories may be intrinsically disposed to
outbreeding and thus face difficulty in evolving inbreeding.
Whether extinction-causing gene drives will commonly avoid resistance evolution
remains to be seen. Nor is it clear that experience with the sterile insect technique will
translate to gene drive extinctions: overwhelming a wild population with sterile
individuals will have different consequences for the evolution of resistance than will

suppression of population densities that creates a paucity of opportunities for mating.
From this perspective, a Y chromosome drive may create a demography of extinction
more similar to the sterile insect technique than does a recessive lethal drive. However,
and as foreshadowed by the sterile insect technique, it is expected that some gene-drive
extinction efforts will succeed and others will fail. We may at least hope that we can
develop a sense for the difference and understand how to improve the chances of success.

Recessive lethal drive equations
Figure 2 provides a schematic to suggest some (but not all) model components.
Female haplotypes: ad, Ad, aD, AD; Male haplotypes: ad, Ad, aD, AD
(Any mating between a D male and a D female will be nonviable. All other matings
produce offspring.)
Maximum brood size per mating: b
(Each outcrossed female produces a brood of b offspring, half of which are female. Each
sib-mated female produces a brood of σb offspring, half of which are female.)
Mating frequencies for parents in generation t: When denoting mating pairs
below, the first subscripted haplotype is for the female and the second is for the male.
Quantities (appropriately subscripted) of the form S(t) and O(t) are fractions
corresponding to (viable) mating pairs formed by the parents in generation t. These
fractions add to 1. The offspring from these generation t matings have their future
(generation t + 1) mating numbers encapsulated in (unnormalized) quantities of the
form S 0 (t) and O0 (t). The sum of all these “primed” quantities is the total, T (t),
number of female offspring from generation t (the potential mothers of generation
t + 1). Not all of these matings produce viable offspring. Dividing the S 0 (t) and O0 (t)
terms by T (t) produces the normalized quantities S(t + 1) and O(t + 1) of the next
generation. The mean fitness in generation t is defined to be w(t) = T (t).
Fractions of sib mating pairs :
Sad,ad (t), SAd,Ad (t), Sad,Ad (t), SAd,ad (t)
Fractions of outcrossed mating pairs:
Oad,ad (t), Oad,Ad (t), OAd,ad (t), OAd,Ad (t),
OaD,ad (t), Oad,aD (t), OaD,Ad (t), Oad,AD (t),
OAD,ad (t), OAd,aD (t), OAD,Ad (t), OAd,AD (t).
(For example, a fraction SAd,ad (t) of the adult females in generation t have haplotype
Ad and mate with an adult male (brother) with haplotype ad. These two first appeared
as offspring in generation t − 1. Note that we do not list potential mating pairs with
both parents carrying the D allele (e.g., SaD,aD (t) and OAD,aD (t)) since they produce no
offspring.)

Fractions of outcrossed males: Mad (t), MAd (t), MaD (t), MAD (t)
Note that we track actual numbers (densities) of female types and only fractions of
male types. This is because each female is allowed to reproduce only once per
generation but males can reproduce multiple times within a generation. Since offspring
numbers are limited by the number of females (and not by the number of males), it is
natural to track mean fitness in terms of females.
The offspring produced in generation t will be the adults of generation t + 1. Offspring
and parents (as well as any unmated males) are assumed to coexist for a brief time in a
given generation, but only offspring transition to the next generation (becoming the
new adults); i.e., all individuals have a life span of one generation. To compute the
mating quantities for the next generation, we first record the numbers of female
offspring haplotypes and their anticipated mating types.

sib matings).)
Remark: The above equations are retrospective in the sense that quantifying the new
mating types in equations (5) and (6) involves frequencies of mating types for females
and males in the parent generation. To see where the different terms come from, it is
instructive to think prospectively for a moment. For example, a fraction SAd,ad (t) of
adult females in generation t have haplotype Ad and sib mate with males (brothers)
having haplotype ad. Since these are sib matings, they each produce a brood of size σb,
half of which are female. Of these female offspring, all have allele d at the d/D locus
(since both parents carried the d allele), and half have allele a at the a/A locus. Similar
fractions apply for the male offspring. Of the σb/2 female offspring from each such
mating, a fraction sA will mate with a brother and a fraction 1 − sA will outcross. (The
mother’s haplotype at the a/A locus determines the fraction of her offspring that sib
mate.) So, for example, each of the featured matings will produce

serves two purposes. Since parental mating pair frequencies are normalized, T (t) is the
mean number of female offspring per female adult in generation t. This is mean
fitness in generation t:
w(t) = T (t) .

T (t) also serves as the normalizing quantity used to turn the raw counts of (anticipated)
matings by generation t offspring into the normalized family frequencies at time t + 1.

mean fitness are normalized by brood size. In fact, the effect of brood size is transient
in this model since we normalize down to mating frequencies each generation. Thus our

Y drive equations
Figure 5 provides a schematic to suggest some (but not all) model components.
Female haplotypes: aX, AX; Male haplotypes: aY, AY, aZ, AZ
(Z is the Y drive allele, carried only in males. Any mating involving a Z male results in
all Z male offspring; no daughters. All matings involving a Y male results in a brood of
half daughters and half Y sons. There can be no sib mating involving Z males since
they have no sisters.)
Brood size is as in the recessive lethal model.
Mating frequencies for parents in generation t: When denoting mating pairs
below, the first subscripted haplotype is for the female and the second is for the male.
Other notations parallel those in the recessive lethal drive model description.

Numbers of outcrossed females: FaX (t), FAX (t)
Fractions of outcrossed males: MaY (t), MAY (t), MaZ (t), MAZ (t)
To compute the mating quantities for the next generation, we first record the numbers
of female offspring haplotypes and their anticipated mating types.

Recessive lethal drive and Y drive with ecologically determined
sib mating rates
In these models, there is only one sib mating frequency sa = sA and it is determined by
mean fitness according to equation (4). Aside from this change in the dynamic updating
of sib mating frequency, the equations for recessive lethal drive and Y drive are as
before.
