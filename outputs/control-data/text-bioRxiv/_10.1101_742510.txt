Abstract

26

Understanding the mechanisms governing ecological stability – why a property such as primary

27

productivity is stable in some communities and variable in others – has long been a focus of ecology.

28

Compensatory dynamics, in which anti-synchronous fluctuations between populations buffer

29

against fluctuations at the community level, is a key theoretical mechanism of stability. Classically,

30

compensatory dynamics have been quantified using a “variance ratio” approach that compares the

31

ratio between community variance and aggregate population variance, such that a lower ratio

32

indicates compensation and a higher ratio indicates synchrony among species fluctuations. However,

33

population dynamics may be influenced by different drivers that operate on different timescales,

34

and evidence from aquatic systems indicates that communities can be compensatory on some

35

timescales and synchronous on others. The variance ratio and related metrics cannot reflect this

36

timescale-specificity, yet have remained popular, especially in terrestrial systems. Here, we develop

37

a timescale-specific variance ratio approach that formally decomposes the classical variance ratio

38

according to the timescales of distinct contributions. The approach is implemented in a new R

39

package, called tsvr, that accompanies this paper. We apply our approach to a long-term, multi-site

40

grassland community dataset. Our approach demonstrates that the degree of compensation versus

41

synchrony in community dynamics can vary by timescale. Across sites, population variability was

42

typically greater over longer compared to shorter timescales. At some sites, minimal timescale-

43

specificity in compensatory dynamics translated this pattern of population variability into a similar

44

pattern of greater community variability on longer compared to shorter timescales. But at other sites,

45

differentially stronger compensatory dynamics at longer compared to shorter timescales produced

46

lower-than-expected community variability on longer timescales. Within every site there were plots

47

that exhibited shifts in the strength of compensation between timescales. Our results highlight that

48

compensatory versus synchronous dynamics are intrinsically timescale-dependent concepts, and our

timescale-specific variance ratio provides a metric to quantify timescale-specificity and relate it

Introduction

53

The stability of ecosystem functions is central to the reliable provisioning of ecosystem services

54

(Oliver et al., 2015), and understanding mechanisms underlying ecological stability is a

55

fundamental question in ecology (MacArthur, 1955). A key insight into ecosystem dynamics is that

56

stable aggregate ecosystem functions such as total productivity can be composed of highly variable

57

component parts (Gonzalez and Loreau, 2009). For example, compensatory dynamics stabilize

58

productivity when different populations have offsetting fluctuations, such that increases in the

59

abundance or biomass of one or more species are accompanied by corresponding decreases in

60

others (e.g., Schindler, 1990, Frost et al., 1995, Bai et al., 2004, Hallett et al., 2014). Conversely,

61

when species increase or decrease together (e.g., when species share responses to an external driver),

62

the resulting synchrony increases aggregate community variability and has been used as a proxy for

63

instability (e.g., Houlahan et al., 2007, Keitt, 2008, Feio et al., 2015, Ma et al., 2017).

64

Population fluctuations are ubiquitous. Consequently, characterizing patterns of species

65

fluctuations over time and in relation to each other is essential to understand stability. Importantly,

66

population fluctuations can be shaped by a variety of drivers that operate on different timescales.

67

For example, acute or pulsed disturbances are a strong predictor of population dynamics in some

68

systems (e.g., heavy rainfall events or cold winter events regulating insect dynamics; Mutshinda et

69

al., 2011). In other systems, population dynamics are strongly driven by long-term climate cycles

70

(Mantua et al., 1997, Sheppard et al., 2016). As a result, communities may exhibit a timescale

71

specificity such that synchrony (or compensation) among species can occur at some timescales but

72

not others (Keitt, 2008, Downing et al., 2008). Moreover, the co-occurrence of short- and long-

73

timescale drivers in the same system may result in communities that are synchronous over some

74

timescales but compensatory over others (as idealized in Fig. 1).

75

Evaluating timescale specificity in community variability has a tradition in aquatic ecology

76

(Vasseur et al., 2005, Keitt and Fischer, 2006, Vasseur and Gaedke, 2007, Downing et al., 2008,

77

Keitt, 2008, Vasseur et al., 2014, Brown et al., 2016), but methods used in that literature have

78

typically relied on data-hungry techniques that may not be appropriate for shorter time series. For

79

example, Vasseur et al. (2005) found that phytoplankton in Lake Constance showed compensatory

80

dynamics at a sub-annual timescales, driven by grazing pressure and competition for nutrients

81

during summer and fall, but synchronous dynamics at most other timescales. Downing et al. (2008)

82

described how zooplankton in experimental ponds had synchronous dynamics at quite short

83

timescales (~10-day periods), but had compensatory dynamics at longer timescales (~80-day

84

periods). Overall, synchrony has tended to be more common than compensatory dynamics in

85

freshwater plankton communities, and the timescales at which compensatory dynamics occur

86

appear to be system-specific (Vasseur et al., 2014, Brown et al., 2016). Timescale-dependent

87

approaches have facilitated a deeper understanding of community stability in freshwaters.

88

Compensatory dynamics have been the subject of much study and debate in terrestrial

89

systems. Some studies find general evidence for compensatory dynamics (Bai et al., 2004, Hector et

90

al., 2010), others find them to be context-dependent (Grman et al., 2010, Hallett et al., 2014, Xu et

91

al., 2015), and others conclude that synchronous dynamics dominate terrestrial systems (Houlahan

92

et al., 2007, Valone and Barber, 2008). To date, terrestrial ecologists have relied exclusively on

93

metrics that do not incorporate timescale (most commonly, those developed by Schluter, 1984,

94

Loreau and de Mazancourt, 2008, Hallett et al., 2014). These types of analysis originated with the

95

classic variance ratio, which can be calculated for the shorter time series available in these systems

96

(Schluter, 1984). The variance ratio compares the variance of the aggregate community to the

97

expected variance under the assumption of independent population fluctuations across the entire

98

time series. As such, a variance ratio greater than one indicates that populations are generally

99

synchronous, whereas a variance ratio less than one indicates compensation (Peterson, 1975,

100

Schluter, 1984). This simplicity and ease of interpretation has held wide appeal across diverse

101

scientific fields (e.g., Gotelli, 2000, Klug et al., 2000, Houlahan et al., 2007, Winfree and Kremen,

102

2009). However, the variance ratio cannot disentangle the timescales at which dynamics occur (Fig.

103

1), ultimately hindering possibilities for considering mechanisms of community dynamics.

104

Here we develop and apply a new timescale-specific variance ratio appropriate for terrestrial

105

grasslands and other systems with shorter, regularly-spaced time series. In contrast to some of the

106

timescale-specific approaches previously used on plankton data, our techniques provide a formal

107

decomposition by timescale of the classic variance ratio approach, so that appropriately

108

averaging/summing the components of the new approach across timescales recovers the classic non-

109

timescale-specific results; one can then quantify the contributions of timescale bands as well as

110

individual timescales. We first develop the theory that underlies our approach and provides

111

timescale-specific measures of community and population variability. Second, we apply this theory

112

to long-term (11–30 years) records of plant community composition at six grasslands across the

113

United States (Hallett et al., 2014). We address the fundamental questions of 1) whether

114

synchrony/compensatory dynamics are timescale-dependent phenomena, and 2) whether

115

compensatory dynamics are rare, compared to synchrony, in grassland systems, as appears to be the

116

case for plankton systems (Vasseur et al., 2005, Keitt and Fischer, 2006, Vasseur and Gaedke, 2007,

117

Downing et al., 2008, Keitt, 2008, Vasseur et al., 2014, Brown et al., 2016). We aim to demonstrate

118

our timescale-specific approach in a way that deepens our understanding of grassland community

119

dynamics as developed using the traditional variance ratio metric (Hallett et al., 2014). Finally, we

Next, we develop timescale-specific statistics using spectral methods, which are a standard

For each plot in each site, we calculated the classic variance ratio, φ; community variability,

replication of part of the analysis of Hallett et al. (2014). We also computed our new, timescale-

can have different numbers of timescales in them, in a way that depends on data time

series length. Comparing the average quantities for a single plot indicated whether short or long

timescales contributed more, per timescale, to aggregate population variability for that plot. Across

240

all the plots in a site, we conducted a paired t-test to test the significance of the difference between

241

timescales for the site as a whole. If the plots within a site can be regarded as independent replicates,

242

p-value results of these tests have the usual probabilistic interpretation. If spatial autocorrelation or

243

another factor means that plots within a site cannot be regarded as independent, then these p-value

results should be interpreted as descriptive statistics, describing the strength of the difference

between two paired distributions of values relative to the variation within the distributions. As such,

we will refer to these as “nominal” p-values.

We used a similar approach to test whether short or long timescales tended to contribute

0.04 to 1.51. The classic variance ratios φ varied from highly compensatory to highly synchronous,

271

with values ranging from 0.08 to 1.98. However, φ was less than one in 72.7% of the 150 plots,

272

seemingly indicating (aggregating across timescales) that most communities were less variable

273

through time than would be expected if species fluctuated independently (but see below for a

274

timescale-specific view).

275
276

Timescale-specific patterns of variability

277

Many plots exhibited marked differences in variability and variance ratios between short and long

278

timescales. To facilitate understanding of results, we first demonstrate this effect with data from one

279

example plot at the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve (JRG), before later presenting results for all

280

plots. Using the classic approach, dynamics at this plot would be considered compensatory, as the

281

classic variance ratio was 0.457 (which is less than 1), and correspondingly CV2com (value 0.047)

282

was less than CV2com_ip (value 0.103). However, when we decomposed variability by timescale

283

bands, the short and long timescale bands showed opposite patterns of synchrony and compensation

284

(Fig. 4). The weighted average of φts(σ) across short timescales was greater than 1, indicating

285

synchronous dynamics on those timescales, but the weighted average of φts(σ) across long

286

timescales was less than 1, indicating compensatory dynamics (Fig. 4a). Correspondingly, the

287

average of CV2com(σ) was slightly higher than the average of CV2com_ip(σ) when these averages

288

were computed across short timescales, but was substantially less when the averages were

289

computed across long timescales (Fig. 4b-d).

290

We applied the same approach to all 150 plots in the six sites (Fig. 5), providing a

291

comprehensive overview of how a timescale approach alters our understanding of compensatory

292

dynamics in these systems. Our data showed average (across plots) greater aggregate population

293

variability at long timescales than at short timescales at all sites (Fig. 5g-l), and likewise for

294

community variability (Fig. 5m-r), except for the Kellogg Biological Station LTER (KBS), where

295

the average CV2com(σ) did not differ between short and long timescales (Fig. 4n). Thus, long

296

timescales were the primary driver of population variability at all sites and of community variability

297

in five of our six sites; this was not surprising given much prior literature on the commonness of

298

temporal autocorrelation in population dynamics (see Discussion).

299

The degree of synchrony and compensation among species differed substantially by

300

timescale at some but not all sites. Short timescales had larger weighted-average values of φts(σ)

301

than long timescales for Jasper Ridge (JRG) and Kellogg Biological Station (KBS; Fig. 5a, b; paired

302

t-test, nominal p < 0.001), but the weighted averages of φts(σ) over short and long timescales were

303

not significantly different at the remaining four sites (Fig. 5c-f; paired t-test, nominal p > 0.5). At

304

both JRG and KBS, the weighted average values of φts(σ) tended to be < 1 over both short and long

305

timescales, indicating some compensation occurred across all timescales, but compensatory

306

dynamics were much stronger over long timescales.

307

While Jasper Ridge and Kellogg Biological Station exhibited similar timescale-specific

308

patterns of compensatory dynamics, timescale-specific patterns of community variability differed

309

between these sites for reasons that our approach reveals. At JRG, population variability was much

310

greater on long than on short timescales (Fig. 5g). Community variability was also higher on long

311

timescales (Fig. 5m), but to a lesser degree than population variability, because species dynamics

312

were more compensatory on long than on short timescales (Fig. 5a). At KBS, population variability

313

was also higher on long than on short timescales, but less markedly so than for JRG (Fig. 5h).

314

Because dynamics were again more compensatory on long than on short timescales for KBS (Fig.

315

5b), community variability was similar on short and long timescales (Fig. 5n). Thus differences

316

across timescales in population variability existed at both JRG and KBS, but opposing differences

317

across timescales in the strength of compensatory dynamics were enough to eliminate timescale

318

differences in community variability for KBS, but only to reduce them relative to population-level

319

differences for JRG.

320

On average, the remaining four sites (Hayes, HAY; Jornada, JRN; Konza, KNZ; and

321

Sevilleta, SEV) demonstrated similar strengths of compensatory dynamics across timescales (Fig.

322

5c-f). For these sites, long timescales contributed more to both population and community

323

variability, and to about the same extent (compare Fig. 5i,o for HAY, Fig. 5j,p for JRN, Fig. 5k,q

324

for KNZ, and Fig. 5i,r for SEV). There was substantial variation in weighted-average φts(σ) among

325

plots at these sites for both long and short timescales. As a result, there were plots within every site

326

that exhibited a greater tendency toward compensation at long compared to short timescales, and

327

others that showed a lesser such tendency. Full spectral decompositions of all quantities for all plots

328

are given in Figs S1-S6. The distributions, across plots, of all spectral quantities are given for each

Discussion

333

A timescale-specific understanding of variability in populations and communities is an important

334

step towards making ecology a predictive science (Kelly and Horton, 2016). Additionally,

335

understanding the links between diversity and stability and the mechanisms that promote diversity

336

and stability are among the long-standing goals of ecology as a field (McNaughton, 1977, Tilman et

337

al., 1998, Ernest and Brown, 2001, Connell and Ghedini, 2015). Although timescale specificity in

338

population dynamics is well-established (e.g., Turchin, 2003, Defriez et al., 2016, Sheppard et al.,

339

2016, Walter et al., 2017), the degree to which community dynamics exhibit timescale specificity is

340

less explored, particularly in terrestrial ecosystems. Timescale specificity in synchrony and

341

compensatory dynamics has been demonstrated in natural and experimental freshwater plankton

342

communities (e.g., Vasseur et al., 2005, Keitt and Fischer, 2006, Vasseur and Gaedke, 2007,

343

Downing et al., 2008, Keitt, 2008, Vasseur et al., 2014, Brown et al., 2016), but methods had not

344

previously been adapted to the shorter, annually sampled time series that are common in terrestrial

345

ecosystems such as grasslands. We developed and applied new methods for the timescale

346

decomposition of the classical variance ratio, using timescale-specific metrics of population and

347

community variability. Although timescale-specific results for six grassland communities show less

348

dramatic differences from results using the classical variance ratio compared to what has been

349

observed in some freshwater systems, our approach did demonstrate the value of considering

350

timescales in 2 of the 6 systems we examined.

351

In contrast to the methods which have been used to study plankton communities, our

352

methods offer a formal decomposition of the classical variance ratio approach. The classical

353

variance ratio and the community and population variability statistics CV2com and CV2com_ip can be

354

recovered exactly from our timescale-specific quantities by summing or averaging appropriately

355

over timescales. Thus our approach formally elaborates the classical approach. In developing our

356

theory, we focused on the classical variance ratio (Peterson, 1975, Schluter, 1984). However, a

357

modified variance ratio was proposed by Loreau and de Mazancourt (2008),

358

∑ √

∑

, and has become popular in recent years. The alternative approach also uses an

359

alternative to our CV2com_ip, which we denote

360

Mazancourt, 2008). We attempted a timescale-specific extension of the Loreau-de Mazancourt

361

approach to the variance ratio in Appendix S3. Our derivations may facilitate future theory, but are

362

so far not satisfactory for application to data. The fundamental problem is that the CV2pop of Loreau

363

and de Mazancourt (2008) does not admit a straightforward timescale decomposition.

364

(Loreau and de

Application of our spectral methods to empirical grassland community data showed that

365

plant populations and total community biomass were generally more variable on long timescales

366

than on short timescales. Greater population variability on long timescales is consistent with

367

previous findings that variance increases with time series length in diverse populations (e.g., Pimm

368

and Redfearn, 1988, Halley and Stergiou, 2005). Long time series include variation on longer

369

timescales (Halley, 2005). In natural populations, “red-shifted” (i.e., autocorrelated, or having more

370

spectral power on long timescales) dynamics are common (Steele, 1985, Pimm and Redfearn, 1988,

371

Halley, 1996).

372

Although some empirical evidence exists for greater community variability on long

373

timescales (Bengtsson et al., 1997), our study appears to be the first observation of this

374

phenomenon in grassland communities. Bengtsson et al. (1997) hypothesized that bird community

375

variability was derived from increased population and environmental variability with time,

376

specifically long-term trends in species abundances and temporal heterogeneity in habitat due to

377

succession. In our study, a large proportion of population and community variability was

378

contributed by fluctuations on long timescales (> 4 years). Yet unlike Bengtsson et al. (1997), our

379

communities were not successional. Instead, a potential mechanism driving variability on long

380

timescales in our systems may be fluctuations in the environmental resources (e.g., water, nutrients)

381

that affect plant productivity. Resource variation likely propagates through ecosystems, ultimately

382

affecting aggregate community properties in ways that depend on species interactions and shared

383

responses to drivers (Ives, 1995). For example, plant community variability at Jasper Ridge showed

384

a clear spectral peak at a timescale of ~10 years. In contrast, no studies have reported greater

385

community variability at short compared to long timescales. We therefore speculate that community

386

variability may generally be greater at long timescales (>4 years) compared to shorter timescales

387

(<4 years).

388

Decomposing community dynamics by timescale may assist in detecting the mechanisms for,

389

and implications of, compensatory dynamics. Compensatory dynamics are promoted by at least two

390

factors: competitive interactions and asynchronous response to environmental change (Ives, 1995,

391

Houlahan et al., 2007, Loreau and Mazancourt, 2013). The latter mechanism is supported by several

392

prior studies in grasslands. For example, Hobbs et al. (2007) reported that differential responses of

393

plant species at Jasper Ridge to a period of prolonged below-average rainfall resulted in functional

394

compensation among species. In a broader analysis across nine long-term datasets, Hallett et al.

395

(2014) also demonstrated negative covariance among species, especially at sites characterized by

396

high precipitation variability. In systems for which the consequential environmental fluctuations are

397

connected with long-timescale environmental oscillations such as the Pacific decadal oscillation, the

398

timescale signature of compensatory dynamics may help illuminate if the mechanism behind

399

compensatory dynamics is competitive interactions or asynchronous response to environmental

400

fluctuations.

401

Comparisons between our results for terrestrial grasslands and prior results with freshwater

402

plankton suggest both similarities and differences. First, our finding of stronger compensatory

403

dynamics at some timescales than others is broadly consistent with previous findings in plankton

404

systems that synchrony versus compensatory dynamics depend on timescale (e.g., Keitt and Fischer,

405

2006, Downing et al., 2008, Vasseur et al., 2014, Brown et al., 2016). Differences by timescale

406

were, however, less profound for grasslands than for the prior plankton studies: no grassland, at the

407

site level, demonstrated a shift from clear compensatory dynamics on one timescale band to clear

408

synchrony on another band, as was observed in both natural plankton populations (e.g., Vasseur et

409

al., 2005) and experimental mesocosms (e.g., Downing et al., 2008). Finally, we did not find strong

410

evidence of synchrony at the site level in any of the systems we studied, unlike the general

411

conclusion that synchronous dynamics prevailed in an analysis of zooplankton in 58 long-term lake

412

datasets (Vasseur et al., 2014).

413

Our interpretations for grasslands have focused on average tendencies within a particular

414

site, either timescale-specificity in the strength of compensatory dynamics (Jasper Ridge, Kellogg

415

Biological Station), or lack thereof (Hayes, Jornada, Konza, and Sevilleta). However, variability

416

across plots within a site was substantial, and every site had some plots that were compensatory on

417

one of the timescale bands we considered and synchronous on the other (Fig. 5). If the variability

418

we observed across plots within a site eclipses sampling variation, then timescale-specific analysis

419

may help reveal, in future work, plot-to-plot heterogeneity in the nature and mechanisms of

420

compensatory dynamics. Exploring potential plot-to-plot variation in the nature of community

421

dynamics probably requires the development of methods to assess the statistical significance of

422

timescale heterogeneities in compensatory dynamics for individual plots. But studying plot-to-plot

423

variation may provide statistical power for illuminating causes of compensatory dynamics that is

424

lacking when making comparisons across whole sites.

425

Timescale dependency in the presence and magnitude of compensatory dynamics may have

426

implications for how ecologists approach and study ecosystems more generally. For example,

427

synthesis efforts that collate patterns of synchrony and compensation should likely consider length

428

of time series used for such efforts, or should use methods that explicitly take timescale into account.

429

Additionally, do results drawn from short-term observations of communities following

430

manipulation change when observed for longer periods?

431

To facilitate wider use and adoption of our timescale-specific approach, we developed an

432

open source R package and present this package alongside our paper. Our timescale-specific version

433

of the variance ratio should be particularly attractive for certain ecosystem types and applications.

434

For example, while wavelet methods for quantifying synchrony in ecological communities are

435

increasing in popularity and provide tremendous flexibility (e.g., Vasseur et al., 2005, Keitt and

436

Fischer, 2006, Vasseur and Gaedke, 2007, Vasseur et al., 2014, Brown et al., 2016, Sheppard et al.,

437

2016), these methods are “data hungry”, requiring long time series. Our methods can be used on

438

shorter time series (e.g., >10 equally spaced time points). We hope our results and R package will

439

facilitate researchers of diverse ecosystem types to further illuminate the nature of compensatory

440

versus synchronous dynamics in ecological communities.

Figures

Figure 1. Introduction to concepts using an idealized example. Five population time series
(panel a, colors distinguish the time series, the black line is the average) were constructed by
summing a sine wave of period (timescale) 3 years and amplitude 0.2 (panel b) with five
randomly and independently phase-shifted sine waves of period 10 years, amplitude 0.6 (panel c),
and then vertically shifting each time series to have minimum value 1. Thus, the time series of
panel a were constructed to be synchronous on the 3-year timescale and asynchronous (randomly
related) on the 10-year timescale. However, the classical variance ratio (Peterson, 1975, Schluter,
1984) was 1.06, suggesting that the species show neither compensation nor synchrony across the
entire time series, missing the deliberately constructed timescale-specific processes.

Figure 3. Application of our theory to the artificial time series of Fig. 1. See text of the Theory
section for interpretations. Panels a-c show the timescale-specific variance ratio φts(σ), aggregate
population variability CV2com_ip(σ), and community variability CV2com(σ). Timescales less than
the Nyquist timescale (gray background) are symmetric to timescales greater than the Nyquist
timescale (white background); we present both to reflect the underlying computation of nontimescale-specific quantities (text near top of a-c) as sums or averages across all timescales, both
above and below the Nyquist timescale (Theory); but conceptually we focus on the timescales
greater than the Nyquist timescale. The horizontal dashed line (a) indicates the boundary
between synchronous and compensatory dynamics for each timescale. Panel d compares
CV2com(σ) to CV2com_ip(σ) for the period-3 (square) and period-10 (circle) oscillations; the 1:1
line separates synchronous from compensatory dynamics. For simplicity, the example used sums
of sinusoids, which oscillate only at discrete timescales, explaining why plotted quantities are 0
(CV2com_ip(σ), CV2com(σ)) or undefined (φts(σ)) except at the timescales of oscillation. Real
ecological signals are broadband and should typically yield plots that are well-defined and nonzero at all timescales.

Figure 4. Results for an example plot at the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve (JRG), which
shows a similar pattern to the artificial data of Fig. 1 (see Fig. 3). The classic, non-timescalespecific approach (text at top of panels a-c) suggests compensatory dynamics, and hence CV2com
is less than CV2com_ip. But decomposing variability by timescale bands indicated contrasting
patterns at short and long timescales: the weighted average of φts(σ) was greater than 1 across
short timescales (panel a), so the average of CV2com(σ) (panel c) was slightly greater than the
average of CV2com_ip(σ) (panel b) across short timescales; whereas there reverse pattern held for
long timescales. Panel d compares the averages of CV2com(σ) and CV2com_ip(σ) across short
(square) and long (circle) timescales. See text of the Results section for further interpretation.
The horizontal solid line in panel a shows the value of the classic variance ratio.

Figure 5. Timescale-specific variance ratio, aggregate population variability and community
variability for all plots in each site. Panels parallel those in Figure 4 and show weighted averages
of φts(σ) (a-f), or averages of CV2com_ip(σ) (g-l) or CV2com(σ) (m-r) across short (blue) or long (red)
timescales. Each pair of points on a panel is one plot. Gray lines indicate the value goes up from
short to long timescales, while black lines indicate the reverse. Stars in each panel denote
nominally significant differences between short or long timescales (paired t-test): *** p <0.001;
