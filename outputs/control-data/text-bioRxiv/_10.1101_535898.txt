Abstract
We conducted a genome-wide association study of host resistance to severe
Plasmodium falciparum malaria in over 17,000 individuals from 11 malariaendemic countries, undertaking a wide ranging analysis which identifies five
replicable associations with genome-wide levels of evidence. Our findings include
a newly implicated variant on chromosome 6 associated with risk of cerebral
malaria, and the discovery of an erythroid-specific transcription start site
underlying the association in ATP2B4. Previously reported HLA associations
cannot be replicated in this dataset. We estimate substantial heritability of severe
malaria (h2 ~ 23%), of which around 10% is explained by the currently identified
associations. Our dataset will provide a major building block for future research on
the genetic determinants of disease in these diverse human populations.

Introduction
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been very successful in
identifying common genetic variants underlying chronic non-communicable
diseases, but have proved more difficult for acute infectious diseases that represent
a substantial portion of the global disease burden and are most prevalent in tropical
regions. This is partly due to the practical difficulties of establishing large sample
collections and reliable phenotypic datasets in resource-constrained settings, but
also theoretical and methodological challenges associated with the study of
pathogenic diseases in populations with high levels of genetic diversity and
population structure3-5. The Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network
(MalariaGEN) was established in 2005 to overcome these obstacles with
standardized protocols, common phenotypic definitions, agreed policies for
equitable data sharing, and local capacity building for genetic data analysis,
thereby enabling large collaborative studies across different countries where
malaria is endemic6. Here we extend previous work by using data collected from
11 malaria-endemic populations to perform the most comprehensive genome-wide
association study of human resistance to severe malaria to date.

Results
A genome-wide dataset representing the diversity of populations from the
malaria-endemic belt
We generated genome-wide SNP typing on samples from our previously described
case-control study, which includes 16,115 individuals admitted to hospital with
severe symptoms of Plasmodium falciparum malaria, and 20,229 population
controls7. In brief, individuals were sampled from 12 study sites, including ten in
sub-Saharan Africa and the others in Vietnam and Papua New Guinea (Table S1).
Severe malaria (SM) was ascertained according to the WHO criteria8, and
represents a heterogeneous phenotype including diagnoses of cerebral malaria
(CM), severe malarial anaemia (SMA), and other malaria-related symptoms (here
referred to as other SM). For our GWAS discovery phase, a subset of samples,
preferentially chosen for phenotype severity and DNA quality, were genotyped on
the Illumina Omni 2.5M platform. We jointly processed these samples to produce

a single set of estimated haplotypes for 17,960 individuals at the set of over 1.5M
SNPs genome-wide that passed our quality control process (Methods). This
dataset includes 6,888 individuals from Mali, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Nigeria,
Cameroon, Tanzania, Vietnam and Papua New Guinea that have not previously
been included in meta-analysis, as well as previously reported data from The
Gambia, Malawi and Kenya 9,10, and thus reflects the haplotype diversity of a
substantial portion of the malaria-endemic world.

A reference panel enriched for African DNA improves imputation accuracy
across the genome
The ethnically diverse nature of our study provides challenges for genomic
inference, including for our ability to impute genotypes at potentially relevant
untyped loci11. To address this, we sequenced the genomes of 773 individuals
from ten ethnic groups in east and west Africa (specifically from the Gambia,
Burkina Faso, Cameroon and Tanzania), including 207 family trios (Figure 1).
We combined genotypes at single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these data
with Phase 3 of the 1000 Genomes Project to form an imputation reference panel
which covers most common genetic variation12 and in which two-fifths of the
donor families are of African ancestry (1,203 of 3,046 individuals). In principle,
the additional representation of African DNA in this panel should lead to
improvements in imputation accuracy for African study populations, and we found
that this was indeed the case, with use of our panel leading to a large increase in
accuracy relative to panels used in our previous GWAS9-11 and a more modest
improvement relative to using the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 panel alone (Figure S1).
Imputation of Vietnamese individuals, and those from Papua New Guinea (PNG)
which is substantially diverged from any reference panel population (Figure 1d),
were less affected by the inclusion of these additional haplotypes.
We specifically examined imputation of malaria-protective alleles in the HBB
gene, which have previously been found difficult to impute9,11. The SNP encoding
the sickle cell mutation (rs334, chr11:5248232) was imputed with r>0.9 in all
African populations, as compared with genotypes obtained through direct typing7.
We did note that some potentially relevant loci still appear not to be accessible
through these data, including the common deletion of HBA1-HBA2 that causes
alpha-thalassaemia (Text S1) and the region around the gene encoding the
invasion receptor basigin13 (Text S2). Thus, although overall accuracy is high
across the genome, additional work will be needed to access a smaller set of
complex but potentially relevant regions.

Association testing reveals a novel association on chromosome 6
We used the imputed genotypes to test for association with severe malaria, and
with severe malaria subtypes, at over 15 million SNPs and indels genome-wide.
Specifically, association tests were conducted within each population using
logistic and multinomial logistic regression (implemented in SNPTEST; see
Methods), including principal components to control for population structure, and
we computed a fixed-effect meta-analysis summary of association across
populations (Figure S3). In view of the complexities observed at known
association signals 9,11,14, we also extended our previously described meta-analysis
method 7,10 to the larger set of populations, phenotypes and variants considered
here. This analysis produces an overall measure of evidence (the model-averaged
Bayes factor, BFavg; Figure 2a) that is sensitive to more complex patterns of
genetic effect than are detected by frequentist fixed-effect analysis (Figure 2b).
The BFavg is computed under specific prior weights that are detailed in Methods.
In particular, BFavg captures effects that are non-additive, as well as effects that are
restricted to particular subphenotypes or population subgroups.

under a range of models and summarized in the model averaged Bayes factor (log10 BFavg, y axis; values are clamped to a maximum value of 12) using prior
weights specified in Methods. Shapes reflect whether the effect size for the model with the highest posterior weight is fixed across populations and subphenotypes (case-control effect,), or suggests variation in effect between populations (x) or between sub-phenotypes (+). b) Comparison of model-averaged
Bayes factor (log10 BFavg, y axis, as in a) and the evidence under an additive model of association with overall SM (-log10 Padd, x axis). For visualization
purposes we have removed variants in the region of rs334 (HbS, chromosome 11) and rs567544458 (glycophorin region, chromosome 4) except the lead variant.
Shapes reflect the highest posterior model as in a. The values for rs334 and rs8176719 lie outside the plot as indicated by arrows; to visualize these we have
projected toward the origin onto the plot boundary. c) Twelve regions of the genome with BFavg > 10,000, in decreasing order of evidence. Columns reflect the
ID, genomic position, alleles, BFavg, P-value computed under an additive model of association with SM status or with SM subphenotypes, nearest gene and
distance to nearest gene for intergenic variants, known linked phenotypes, and combined frequencies in study cases and controls. Bar plots summarise our
inference about the mode of effect, and distribution of effects between SM subtypes and between populations. The last column reflects the evidence for
association observed in replication samples (log10 BFrep), assessed using the effect size distribution learnt from discovery samples. Where not directly typed, a
tag SNP was used to assess replication evidence as detailed in Table S2. Rows are in bold if they showed positive replication evidence (BFrep > 1). d)

Several regions of the genome showed evidence for association in this analysis,
including seven regions with BFavg > 1x105, twelve with BFavg > 1x104 (Figure
2c), and 95 with BFavg > 1,000. Among these, our data convincingly replicate
previously confirmed associations at HBB, ABO, ATP2B4, and in the glycophorin
region on chromosome 4, while an additional previously reported variant in
ARL14 also shows stronger evidence in this larger sample 10. Both a direct
interpretation of the Bayes factor, as well as false discovery rate methods suggest a
relatively small number of our top signals represent real associations (e.g. roughly
5-9 associations among the top 95 given plausible prior odds15 of 10-6 to 10-5; 5
regions meeting FDR<5% based on the multinomial test Padd). Compatible with
this, we found evidence of replication for one newly identified locus (rs62418762;
BFavg=4.8x105; BFreplication = 5; replication Padditive=0.02 for an additive risk effect
of the derived allele on CM and SMA; combined BF=2.4x106; combined Padd =
6.7x10-10; Figure 3), in addition to the four previously confirmed associations,
from among 26 regions that we attempted to replicate using direct typing in the
additional set of 15,634 individuals not included in our GWAS (Table S2).

effect sizes estimated from imputed genotypes in discovery samples. A P-value against
the null that all three effect sizes are zero is given. Middle: effect sizes estimated from

region of chromosome 6 between MAP3K7 and the nearest gene EPHA7, which
encodes Ephrin type-A receptor 7, a regulator of neurodevelopment and neural cell
adhesion 16. Other type A ephrin receptors have been implicated in liver-stage
malaria 17. However, rs62418762 lies over 700kb distant from EPHA7 and it is
not immediately clear whether any functional link between them exists. A number
of non protein-coding transcripts lie nearby (e.g. the pseudogene ATF1P1), as do
reported signals of association with neurodegenerative disorders18,19, and these
may provide clues as to the underlying mechanism.

Genome-wide data suggests a residual polygenic contribution to malaria risk
We used published methods to estimate the heritability of severe malaria captured
by genome-wide genotypes (e.g. heritability explained by SNPs on the genotyping
array (h2)= 0.23, 95% CI = 0.16 – 0.30; computed across African populations
using PCGC20 assuming a 1% population prevalence of severe malaria; Figure S4
and Table S3). The HBB, ABO, glycophorin and ATP2B4 loci appear to contribute
around 11% of this total (i.e. around 2.5% of liability scale phenotype variation),
and we noted a trend for the remaining heritability to concentrate near proteincoding genes and at lower-frequency variants (Figure S4d). A number of caveats
apply to these estimates, which assume a particular relationship between effect
size, allele frequency and the degree of LD surrounding causal variants, all of
which may be distorted by effects of natural selection 21,22, and may further be
affected by unmeasured environmental confounders. Nevertheless, our results are
comparable to previously reported estimates from family-based studies in east
Africa23, and suggest that further susceptibility loci will be discoverable with
additional data. To assist researchers to integrate our data with other sources of
information, including future genetic association studies and functional
experiments, the raw and imputed data as well as a full set of results from our
analysis are being made available (Data availability) and can be found via the
MalariaGEN website (http://www.malariagen.net).
Joint analysis of associations reveals substantial heterogeneity
We examined the nature of association at replicated loci in more detail (Figure 2
and Figure 4), revealing considerable heterogeneity in mode of effect (Figure 2c)
and across populations and subphenotypes. The sickle haemoglobin allele (HbS,
encoded by rs334) is present in all African populations studied, but varies
considerably in estimated effects, with greater than five-fold difference between
the strongest estimate (OR=0.10 in the Gambia) and the weakest (OR=0.5 in
Cameroon). This does not seem to be explained by the presence of the competing
HbC mutation in west African populations (Figure 4), which is at low frequency
in Cameroon. The O blood group-encoding mutation rs8176719 is common in all
populations but, in our analysis, appears to have the greatest protective effect in
African populations, with an opposite direction of effect observed in Papua New
Guinea, an unexpected feature which is also observed in replication samples
(Figure S5) and could point to hitherto unexplained subtleties in the mechanism of
protection of this allele 24,25. The structural variant DUP4, which encodes the
Dantu NE blood group phenotype 14 and is in LD with rs567544458 in our
genome-wide imputation (Fig 2c), is essentially absent from study populations
outside east Africa (f < 0.5% except in Malawi, Tanzania and Kenya). Finally, our
data demonstrate differences in effect size between malaria subphenotypes, with
all of the replicating variants displaying smaller effects in nonspecific cases of
severe malaria compared to cerebral or severely anaemic cases, likely reflecting
the mixed phenotypic composition of this set of samples (Figure 2d and Figure
4a). Inclusion of these variants in a joint model suggests they act largely
independently in determining malaria risk (Figure 4c).

including a population indicator and five principal components in each population as covariates. Each variant is encoded according to the mode of

Functional annotation across cell types reveals an erythroid-specific
transcription start site in ATP2B4
We reasoned that functional annotations might provide clues to further putatively
causal variants among our list of most associated regions. To assess this, we
annotated all imputed variants with information indicative of functional
importance, including location and predicted function within genes26, chromatin
state 27-29 and transcriptional activity 28,30,31 across cell types, status as an eQTL3133
, and association evidence from other traits34-37. This analysis revealed a number
of potentially functional variants with evidence of association (Table S4).

We uncovered compelling evidence that the association in ATP2B4, which encodes
the plasma membrane calcium pump PMCA4, is driven by an alternative
transcription start site (TSS) that is specific to erythroid cells (Figure 5).
Specifically, we found that associated SNPs overlap a binding site for the GATA1
transcription factor, an important regulator of expression in erythroid cells 27,29,38,
in the first intron of ATP2B4. The derived allele at one of these SNPs
(rs10751451) disrupts a GATA motif 31, and the same SNPs have previously been
shown to associate with ATP2B4 expression levels in whole blood 33, in
experimentally differentiated erythrocyte precursors 31, and with PMCA4 levels in
circulating RBCs 39. We noted that the GATA1 site lies just upstream of an exon
that is not listed in the GENCODE 40, RefSeq 41, or ENSEMBL 42 transcript
models, but that can be found in FANTOM5 43 (Figure 5b). Inspection of RNAseq data revealed that this forms the first exon of the main ATP2B4 transcript
expressed by erythroid cells29,31,44, as well as by the K562 cell line, but appears not
to be expressed in other cell types 27,28,32 (Figure 5a). Moreover, the derived
allele, which is associated with malaria protection, is correlated with decreased
expression of this alternative first exon (P=0.01, using data from 24 fetal and adult
erythroblasts31; Figure 5g) and all subsequent exons (P<0.03) of ATP2B4, but not
with the annotated first exon (P=0.25). These results indicate that the malariaassociated SNPs affect ATP2B4 expression in a erythroid-specific manner, by
affecting the promoter of a TSS that is only active in these cells.
The situation outlined above for ATP2B4 is reminiscent of the well-known
mutation at the Duffy blood group locus (DARC/ACKR1), which protects against
P. vivax malaria by preventing erythrocytic expression of the Duffy antigen
receptor through disruption of a GATA1 binding site 45,46. However, the
mechanism by which ATP2B4 affects parasite processes remains unknown. The
malaria-protective allele at rs10751451 is known to associate with red blood cell
indices (notably with increased mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration
(MCHC) 31,35,47). We found some evidence that genetic predisposition to high
MCHC levels may itself decrease malaria susceptibility (negative observed
correlation between MCHC and SM effect size at sentinel SNPs previously
identified as associated with haematological indices in European individuals 35,
ρ=-0.15, P=0.01; in a mendelian randomization framework; Figure 5h). However,
the protective effect at ATP2B4 appears substantially stronger than this trend and
suggests a genuinely pleiotropic effect whose mechanism against malaria is yet to
be determined.
Our analysis of functional annotations revealed a number of additional variants
with some evidence of function (Table S4). These include a potentially regulatory
variant near H6PD, as well as a variant upstream of VAC14 which has been
implicated in Typhoid fever 48 and S.Typhi invasion 34, detailed further in Text S4.

Imputation reveals a lack of association with classical HLA alleles
Motivated by the modest evidence for association observed in the HLA (Table
S2), we used a published method 49 to impute classical HLA alleles and tested for
association with each allele as described above for genome-wide variants (Figure
6a). The strongest evidence for association with an HLA antigen was observed at
HLA-B*42 (BFavg = 937; synonymous with HLA-B*42:01 in this panel). By
contrast, an order of magnitude stronger evidence was observed at regional SNPs,
including rs2523650 (BFavg=2.2x104; additive model OR=0.88 for the nonreference 'C' allele; 95%CI=0.94-0.93; Padd=2.4x10-6) which has previously been
associated with blood cell traits and expression of regional genes (Table S4), but
this signal did not replicate in additional samples (BFreplication=0.09). Most notably,
the HLA-B*53 allele, which has previously been reported as associated with
strong protection against severe malaria in the Gambia 1, showed no evidence for
association across populations (BFavg=0.28; OR = 0.99, 95%CI = 0.91-1.07 in

fixed-effect meta-analysis under a dominance model where the effect is due to
presence of the antigen) or in any individual population (e.g. OR= 0.99, 95%CI =
0.88-1.13 in the Gambia, Figure S6).

We considered whether imperfect imputation could explain the lack of observed
association with HLA alleles. Imputed HLA antigen frequencies were broadly
consistent with published frequencies estimated by serotyping in the same
populations (Figure 6b), and HLA-B*53 was imputed at reasonably high
frequency and high confidence (estimated frequency = 7-18%, IMPUTE info score
> 0.94 in all African populations). To directly test imputation accuracy, we
obtained HLA types of a subset of 31 Gambian case individuals by Sanger
sequencing (Table S5 and Text S5), and confirmed that HLA B*53 was relatively
well imputed in these samples (e.g. correlation = 0.92 between imputed dosage
and true number of copies of the allele, reflecting 5 individuals imputed with
probability > 0.75 as heterozygote carriers of B*53, of which one appears
incorrect). However, the closely related B*35 allele was much less accurately
imputed, with four of eight carriers imputed as having non-B*35 genotypes,
including one imputed to carry B*53. This may be the reason for the relatively
low observed frequency of imputed B*35 alleles (Figure 6b), and is notable
because B*53 is thought to have arisen from B*35 via a gene conversion50. Thus,
while our failure to replicate this widely cited association appears robust, future
work to improve HLA inference in these populations is needed to provide
additional clarity.
Genome-wide data suggest evidence for polygenic selection
Malaria is regarded as having played a strong role in shaping the human genome
through natural selection51,52, and observations of allele frequency differences are
commonly used to motivate the study of specific mutations (e.g.53-55). We sought
to assess whether variants associated with malaria susceptibility show evidence of
selection by comparing with genome-wide allele frequency variation between
populations (Figure 7 and Figure S7-S9). We found that the alleles with the
strongest evidence of protection tend to be at lower frequency in non-African
populations than expected given the genome-wide distribution (e.g. conditional
rank of allele in European populations, given African allele count (rankEUR) < 0.5
for 10 of 12 regions with BFavg >10,000; 46 of 90 regions with BFavg >1,000;
based on reference panel allele counts; Figure 7a), consistent with the hypothesis
that these alleles have been maintained at high frequency in African populations
by positive selection. However, this comparison provides extremely modest levels
of evidence - even for individual alleles where selection of this type is well
accepted. We similarly found modest evidence for within-Africa differentiation
(e.g. P=1x10-3 against the null model of no differentiation, for the 12 regions with
BFavg>10,000; P=0.02 across 92 regions with BFavg > 1,000, excluding all but one
variant within the HLA region; Figure 7b-c). A further discussion of
differentiated loci is found in Text S9.
These analyses add new weight to the hypothesis that malaria-driven selection has
played a polygenic role in shaping human genomes in endemic populations.
However, this evidence is rather weak, and it is equally clear that many of the
most differentiated alleles, including those within the HLA (e.g. HLA-DPB*01;
frequency range 25-54% in African populations; PXtX = 1.3x10-14), variants in
CD36 (e.g. rs73711929, frequency range 2-20% in African populations; PXtX =
8x10-20), as well as variants in regions associated with skin pigmentation56 (e.g.
rs1426654; frequency range 83-99% in African populations; PXtX=3x10-15) are not
associated with susceptibility to P. falciparum malaria (Figure S11). Other
selective forces must have driven the evolution of these alleles57 and in many cases
these remain to be identified.

Figure 7: Empirical evidence for frequency differentiation of the most-associated
alleles. a) The European population rank (rankEUR, y axis) plotted against the evidence
for association (log10 BFavg, x axis) for the protective allele at each of the 90 lead
variants satisfying BFavg > 1000 and having assigned ancestral allele. For each allele A,
rankEUR is defined as the proportion of alleles genome-wide having lower or equal count
than A in European populations, conditional on having the same frequency in African
populations. In practice we estimate rankEUR empirically from the joint allele count
distribution in reference panel samples (Figure S7), further stratified according to
whether the protective allele is ancestral or derived. On average rankEUR is expected to
equal 50% (red dashed line). Points are labelled by the rsid, nearest or relevant gene(s),
or by functional variant where known; "O" refers to rs8176719 which determines O
blood group. b) Evidence for within-Africa differentiation (PXtX, y axis), plotted against
the evidence for association (log10 BFavg, x axis) for each of the 92 lead variants
satisfying BFavg > 1000, after removing all but rs2523650 from within the HLA region.
PXtX is computed from an empirical null distribution of allele frequencies learnt across
control samples in the seven largest African populations (Figures S8-S9). c) quantilequantile plot for PXtX across the top 92 regions in panel b.

Discussion
This analysis identifies five replicable loci with strong evidence for association
with resistance to severe malaria: HBB, ABO, ATP2B4, the glycophorin region on
chromosome 4, and a new locus between MAP3K7 and EPHA7 on chromosome 6
whose causal mechanism is unknown. The HBB, ABO and glycophorin
associations correspond to known phenotypic variants of human red blood cells,
namely sickle cell trait and the O and Dantu blood group phenotypes. Building on
previous work31, our analysis indicates that the associated haplotype in ATP2B4
also has a specific effect on erythrocyte function. The putative protective allele
disrupts a GATA1 binding site upstream of a transcription start site that is only
active in erythroid cells, and thus reduces expression of this gene in erythrocyte
precursors. This is reminiscent of the protective effect of the Duffy null allele
against P. vivax malaria, which also involves disruption of a GATA1 binding site
causing erythrocyte-specific suppression of the Duffy antigen receptor 45,46, and it
adds to growing evidence that tissue-specific transcriptional initiation is an
important factor in determining human phenotypes 58,59. ATP2B4 encodes the
main erythrocyte calcium exporter, and the associated haplotype has been
experimentally shown to control calcium efflux and hydration31,39. This is
consistent with the observed effects on red cell traits35 and with the hypothesis that
ATP2B4 modulates parasite growth within erythrocytes, perhaps by affecting
calcium signaling mechanisms that are essential to several stages of the parasite
lifecycle60,61. In theory, this finding raises the possibility of therapeutic blockage
of ATP2B4 in erythrocytes without otherwise affecting physiology. Based on the
estimated effect of the associated SNPs, this might provide ~1.5-fold protection
against severe malaria and be efficacious in the ~90% of individuals who do not

currently carry the protective homozygous genotype at this locus, and it is open to
speculation whether this could lead to worthwhile therapy in practice.

The five loci identified so far appear to explain around 11% of the total genetic
contribution to variation in malaria susceptibility (Figure S4). It is possible that
this estimate is confounded, e.g. by unusual LD patterns or by environmental
factors such as variation in underlying infection rates, and it should likely be
treated with caution. Nevertheless, it raises the question as to why only five loci
can be reliably detected at present. Selection due to malaria has been sufficiently
strong to maintain alleles such as sickle haemoglobin at high frequency in affected
African populations62 (Figure 7). However, it has evidently also led to complex
patterns of variation at malaria resistance loci. This is exemplified by the
emergence of haemoglobin C and multiple haplotypes carrying sickle
haemoglobin at HBB, and by copy number variation observed at the alpha globin
and glycophorin loci14,63. Additionally there is evidence for long-term balancing
selection at the ABO64 and glycophorin65 loci which may be malaria-related. In
theory, the simplest outcome for a strongly protective allele is that it would sweep
to fixation, but unlike for P.vivax66 no sweep of a mutation providing resistance to
P. falciparum malaria is known. Remaining protective alleles may therefore have
effect sizes too small to be subject to strong selection, requiring large sample sizes
to detect. Genome-wide association studies of other common diseases have shown
the benefit of exceptionally large sample sizes 67-71, and although there are many
practical obstacles to achieving this for severe malaria, particularly since its
incidence has fallen in recent years due to improved control measures72,73, efforts
to collect new samples and to combine data across studies61 are warranted. It is
also possible that relevant alleles may have become balanced due to pleiotropic
effects, or be subject to compensatory parasite adaptation - both scenarios that
might lead to maintenance of allelic diversity. Dissecting such signals is naturally
challenging for GWAS approaches and may require other techniques, such as
sequencing and joint analysis of host and parasite genomes from infected
individuals, to address.

1. Collection and processing of whole-genome sequence data
1.1.

Collection and sequencing of African individuals

Blood samples were collected from a total of 773 individuals from Gambia, Burkina Faso,
Cameroon and Tanzania, and sequenced to an average of 10x coverage on the Illumina HiSeq 2000
platform at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, using 100bp paired end reads. In addition, one
Gambian trio was additionally sequenced using three alternate library preparation methods (lowquantity and whole-genome amplification pipelines) for a total of 782 sequenced samples.

1.2.

Data alignment and QC

Reads were mapped to the GRCh37 human reference genome with additional sequences as
modified by the 1000 Genomes Project (hs37d5.fa), using BWA74 with base quality score
recalibration (BQSR) and local realignment around known indels as implemented in GATK75.

1.3.

Variant detection

We used GATK UnifiedGenotyper 75 to identify potential polymorphic sites on autosomal
chromosomes, using all 782 samples as well as the 680 samples of African ancestry from the 1000
Genomes Project, and running in 50kb chunks.
We used GATK VQSR75 to separately filter SNPs and indels. For SNPs, we included three
training sets: HapMap SNPs, SNPs on the Omni 2.5M array, and 1000 Genomes Phase 3 sites. For
indels we used the ‘Mills’ training set as recommended in the GATK documentation. We based
filtering on read depth, mapping quality, quality by depth, the MQRankSum and ReadPosRankSum
measures of bias in reference versus alternate allele mapping quality or read positions, and tests for
strand bias and inbreeding coefficient. We filtered variants applying a sensitivity setting of 99.5%
(--ts_filter_level 0.95) for SNPs and 95% for INDELs (--ts_filter_level 0.95). We further restricted
to biallelic sites.

1.4.

Genotype likelihood computation, genotyping and phasing

We used GATK HaplotypeCaller 76to compute genotype likelihoods at all sites passing the filter
described above as well as sites in 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 reference panel. We then used
BEAGLE v4.0 77 to generate genotype calls from the genotype likelihoods. We range BEAGLE in
windows of 50,000 SNPs, including trio information for Gambian samples. Due to the observed
long runtimes when sampling trios, we specified trioscale=3 when running BEAGLE to reduce
computation times. We then concatenated results across chromosomes.
To estimate haplotypes, we first removed variants not present in the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 panel
or variants that had alleles differing from those in the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 panel, using the
‘check’ mode of SHAPEIT278. We then used SHAPEIT2 to phase each chromosome. We
included trio information for Gambian samples, specified a window size of 0.5 (--window), an
effective sample size of 17,469 (--effective-size), 200 model states (--states), included 1000
Genomes Phase 3 haplotypes in the phasing process (--input-ref), and used the hapmap combined
recombination map in build 37 coordinates (-M).

1.5.

Construction of combined imputation reference panel

To construct a combined imputation reference panel, we removed repeated samples. We combined
phased haplotypes at the remaining samples with those from the 1000 Genomes Project phase 3
panel. The final panel contains 77,931,101 variants and 3,277 samples, of which 773 are from our
set of sequence data and 2,504 are from the 1000 Genomes panel. In total, the panel includes 1,434

2.2.

Sample genotyping

2.3.

Data alignment

Study samples were collected and prepared for genotyping as described previously 7,10.
Sample genotyping and genotype calling were performed as described previously10. In brief, all
samples were genotyped on the Illumina Omni 2.5M platform at the Wellcome Trust Sanger
Institute. We used three genotype calling algorithms (Illumina Gencall, GenoSNP, and Illuminus)
and formed the consensus genotype call by taking the consensus of the three algorithms, or of two
algorithms where the third algorithm reported a missing call. Genotypes for which a discrepant
call were made were treated as missing.
We used strand information from array manifest files provided by Illumina, and those from a
remapping process implemented by William Rayner at the Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics,
Oxford, to determine the strand of each assay on each of the two genotyping platforms used. We
omitted variants where mapping or strand information was discrepant, with some adjustments for
Omni 2.5M 'quad' array as described below. Additionally, we annotated each variant with the
reference allele as taken from the build 37 reference sequence FASTA file.
We used these data with QCTOOL to realign study genotypes. The resulting 'aligned' datasets are
encoded so that the first allele reflects the reference allele, the second allele the non-reference
allele, and all alleles are expressed relative to the forward strand of the reference sequence,
simplifying downstream analysis.
As a sanity check we plotted the estimated frequency of each non-reference allele against the
frequency in the closest reference panel group in each populations. The Kenyan dataset (which
was typed using the Omni 2.5M quad ‘D’ version manifest) showed a substantial number of SNPs
with frequencies obviously wrongly specified. Comparison of the flanking sequence and alleles
reported in the manifest file identified 18,763 SNPs that had alleles coded the incorrectly. We
manually fixed these SNPs by recoding these alleles, making them consistent with the flanking
sequence, the more recent 'H' version of the manifest, and the Omni 2.5M ‘octo’ chip manifest.
We also updated the positions of 495 SNPs annotated as lying on the pseudo-autosomal part of the
X chromosome (Chr=’XY’ in the Illumina manifest) but with position = 0. We applied these
updates, repeated the alignment process for Kenya, and regenerated the frequency plot. A small
number of SNPs in each population still show distinct frequencies compared to reference panel
data (Figure S13).

2.4.

Sample quality control

We used QCTOOL to compute the proportion of missing genotype calls, the average proportion of
heterozygous calls per sample, and the average X channel and Y channel intensities across
autosomal chromosomes in each population. Values were averaged over a subset of SNPs ('the QC
SNP set') chosen to have low missing rates in all populations. We ran ABERRANT79 to identify
individuals with outlying mean intensities separately in each population. Considerable variation in
the spread of quality between populations was observed, and we picked population-specific values
of the ABERRANT lambda parameter based on visual inspection of the plots. We also manually
adjusted the ABERRANT-derived exclusions to include a small number of samples in each
population which were observed to visually cluster with the main set of included samples, but
called as outlying by ABERRANT.
We next plotted logit(missing call rate) against average heterozygosity in each population. We
excluded samples with greater than 10% missingness or heterozygosity outside the range 0.2-0.4 in
African populations, below 0.175 in Vietnam, or below 0.13 in PNG outright, across the QC SNP
set. We then applied ABERRANT to the remaining non-excluded samples choosing a value of the
lambda parameter per population based on inspection. As for intensity outliers, we specifically
included some groups of samples visually clustering with the main group of samples but called as
outlier by ABERRANT. We plotted heterozygosity against missingness annotating the removed
samples. Figures S14 and S15 show mean intensity, missingness, and heterozygosity, computed
across all variants, with excluded samples annotated.

set of 18,515
that

across the autosomes. In addition, for some purposes described below we used a smaller set
17,664 samples (referred to as the 'conservative' set of samples) obtained by repeating the above
process with more conservative values of the ABERRANT lambda parameter.

2.5.

Gender determination

Array intensity values on the sex chromosomes are informative about the underlying sex of
samples and we used these to confirm gender. Specifically, we plotted overall intensity (X channel
plus Y channel intensity) averaged across the X chromosome against overall intensity averaged
across the Y chromosome (Figure S16). To infer sex, we modeled these average intensities as
drawn from a bivariate normal distribution, with separate mean and covariance parameters in males
and females. Almost all samples had sex determined by direct genotyping of amelogenin SNPs 7
and we used these assignments to estimate the model parameters. A small number of samples were
observed to lie near a point consistent with female-like intensity values on the X chromosome but
male-like intensity values on the Y chromosome; this could potentially indicate males with an extra
copy of the X chromosome. We therefore considered an additional ‘mixed’ cluster with parameters
computed from the fitted male and female clusters on the X and Y chromosome, and with no
covariance between X and Y chromosome intensities.
We used the ‘conservative’ set of included samples to estimate these parameters. Based on the
fitted model we then probabilistically assigned gender to all samples sample based on Bayes rule:
P(gender | intensities) ∝ P(intensities | gender)×prior(gender)
Here the first term is computed using the bivariate normal model described above, and we
normalize the formula under the assumption that every sample is either male, female, or ‘mixed’.
We specified a 1% prior probability of ‘mixed’ gender, and equal prior probability of 49.5% on
each of the male and female clusters. Finally, we assigned each gender having at least 70%
posterior probability and treated the gender of other samples as uncalled. Of the 18,515 samples in
the QC set, 20 had mixed or missing gender by this assignment, while 38 had assignment
discrepant with the amelogenin-determined gender. We removed mixed/missing gender samples
from downstream analyses.
We noted a trend for male samples to have slightly higher mean intensity values across autosomes
than females on average. We speculate this may be because, lacking one copy of the X
chromosome, males carry a higher proportion of autosomal DNA overall.

2.6.

Sample relatedness and principal component analysis

We used QCTOOL to compute a matrix of pairwise relatedness coefficients in each population. To
do this, we first chose a subset of SNPs with using a preliminary version of the SNP QC process
described below, and used inthinnerator (Online Resources) to thin this set of SNPs to lie no
closer than 0.02cM apart in the Hapmap combined recombination map. We additionally excluded
SNPs from regions of known associations, the region chr6:25,000,000-40,000,000 which contains
the HLA, and the region of the common inversion on chromosome 8. We used QCTOOL with the
resulting set of 157,085 SNPs to compute the normalized allele sharing (‘relatedness’) matrix
R = (rij)
where rij reflects the correlation in genotype between sample i and j, normalized by variant
frequency. The number rij may be treated as an estimate of relatedness with values near 1
reflecting identity and values near 0 reflecting unrelated samples, relative to the average
relatedness in the population 80,81.
For each pair of samples with relatedness > 0.75 we noted the sample with the highest rate of
missing genotype calls. A total of 538 samples were identified in this way, the majority from the
Malawi and Kenya datasets, and likely reflect duplicate genotyping. We removed these samples
from the datasets.
For each remaining pair of samples with relatedness > 0.2 we again noted the sample with the
highest rate of missing genotype calls; these represent samples that are relatively closely related to
other samples in the same study sample. A total of 801 samples were identified in this way.
We formed the eigendecomposition of the matrix R and used this to compute and plot principal
components (PCs) in each population. Based on visual inspection of these plots, we further
identified a total of 40 samples outlying on any of the first ten PCs. We recomputed R and the PCs
after excluding these individuals, to produce a set of PCs for association analysis.

Summary of sample
QC under aCC-BY 4.0 International license.

In total 17,960 samples passed QC criteria, had non-missing / non-mixed gender assignment, and
were not identified as duplicates as described above. We took all of these samples through to the
phasing and imputation as described below. Of these samples, a total of 17,056 samples were
identified as not outlying on principal components, not closely related and having assigned
case/control status, and were included in downstream analyses. Table S7 summarises the sample
QC.

2.8.

Re-estimating genotype cluster positions

We used intensities and genotype calls for the 'conservative' sample set to re-estimate the positions
of genotype clusters at each SNP in each population using QCTOOL. QCTOOL fits a multivariate
t distribution to each genotype cluster; we specified 5 degrees of freedom. We used these clusters
to annotate cluster plots of individual variants and to implement the recall test described below.

2.9.

Computation of SNP QC metrics

We based QC on several metrics, computed separately in each population:
• The estimated minor allele frequency (MAF).
• The proportion of missing genotype calls (missingness).
• A P-value for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium 82, computed in control samples (PHWE).
• A 'plate test' P-value against the null model that genotypes are uncorrelated with the plate
on which each sample was genotyped (Pplate), described further below.
• A 'recall test' P-value, which compares the genotype frequencies to frequencies after a recalling process based on the estimated cluster positions across populations. This is
described further below.
For the plate test, we implemented a logistic regression model treating the genotype as outcome
and an indicator of the 96-well plate on which the sample was supplied for genotyping as a
predictor in each population. We included case/control status and an initial set of five principal
components as covariates and computed a likelihood ratio test P-value for the effect of including
plate as a predictor.
The 'recall' test was motivated by the observation that some otherwise well-typed SNPs were
poorly genotyped in individual populations. We implemented a re-calling procedure in which the
intensity data from each population was matched against a mixture model of intensities based on
the cluster positions learnt in all other populations. In each population we then computed a p-value
against the null model that the frequency in the original and re-called genotypes were the same
using Fisher's exact test.
We observed study populations to vary considerably both in size and in quality of typing, with the
two smallest African sets (Mali and Nigeria) and, to a lesser extent, Malawi, having higher missing
data rates, and Kenya having lower rates (Figure S17). Inspection of cluster plots suggests that the
higher missing rates are largely due to higher levels of noise in intensity values for these
populations.

2.10.

Choice of SNP QC criteria

We used association test statistics computed under a general logistic regression model, including
additive and heterozygote parameters, as a guide to choosing appropriate thresholds for the above
metrics. Specifically, we tested for association with severe malaria, including 5 principal
components as covariates in each population. For given QC criteria we plotted association test
results annotating QC fails, along with qq plots for the variants passing QC.
In choosing SNP QC thresholds, we were motivated by the observation that the combination of
consensus genotype calling (which is relatively conservative in calling genotypes) with statistical
phasing across populations (which fills in missing genotypes based on inferred haplotype sharing)
would likely produce a high-quality set of haplotypes for downstream inference. For this reason
we aimed to produce a single set of SNPs with high quality data across populations for input to the
phasing process. Based on this we chose a set of criteria applied to the nine largest populations to
compute a list of SNPs to include. We removed SNPs with missingness > 2.5% in Kenya and
PNG, > 5% in Gambia, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Cameroon and Vietnam, and > 10% in Malawi and
Tanzania. We also excluded SNPs with P<1x10-20 for HWE, P < 1x10-3 for the plate test and
P<1x10-6 for the recall test in each population. Finally, we included each of the remaining SNPs
that was at MAF > 1% in at least two populations and passed the above thresholds in all nine
populations considered. Data from the Mali and Nigeria populations, which had the lowest sample
counts (484 and 133 samples, respectively) and empirically lower rates of high-quality genotyping
(Figure S17), was not used to inform the SNP selection process.

The criteria above were observed
to lead
to aessentially

statistics (Figure S18). In particular we noted that a set of SNPs close to the ends of chromosomes
were excluded by these criteria; more information on this is provided in Text S2 and Figure S19.

2.11.

X chromosome SNP QC

To QC the X chromosome we proceeded as for autosomes with the following adjustments. We
excluded the pseudoautosomal region (defined as variants with position < 2,699,520 or >
154,931,044; this region contained ~400 typed SNPs). We observed elevated rates of males called
as heterozygous within the X transposed region (XTR, defined as chrX: 88,457,462-92,374,313)
and excluded this region as well. Approximately 3,400 SNPs were removed this way. In
computing summary statistics for males we treated all heterozygous calls as missing and
homozygous calls as the corresponding hemizygous calls. We applied the SNP missingness
threshold and the plate test separately in males and females; we replaced the Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium test with a test of difference in frequency between males and females (based on a
likelihood ratio test P < 1x10-6). We did not implement the recall test for X chromosome SNPs.

2.12.

Assessment of cluster plots and additional QC

As an additional sanity check, we plotted cluster plots for all SNPs with genotypic association test
P < 1x10-5 and manually excluded those with obviously problematic cluster plots. Some SNPs are
targeted by duplicate assays on the Illumina Omni 2.5M array. For each duplicate assay, we
excluded the assay showing highest missingness, on average, across populations. We also
restricted to SNPs present on both ‘quad‘ and ‘octo’ platforms.

2.13.

Summary of SNP QC

Table S8 shows the number of SNPs excluded by each criteria and the SNPs included in the final
QC set. We used QCTOOL to subset the data for each population to the set of included SNPs. We
then merged data across populations, generating a single GEN format file per chromosome
containing all the 17,960 high-quality samples included in the study.

3. Phasing and imputation
3.1.

Genome-wide phasing

3.2.

Recomputation of principal components

We used SHAPEIT2 78 to jointly phase the 17,960 samples passing QC. In detail, we ran
SHAPEIT2 on each chromosome separately specifying an effective sample size of 17,469 and 200
copying states, and using the HapMap combined recombination map. As above we note that in
addition to phasing, SHAPEIT2 imputes missing genotypes at typed SNPs with missing data, so
that the output of this step contains hard-called phased genotypes with no missing data.
Following phasing we recomputed principal components across all populations, across African
populations, and in each population separately, using phased genotypes. These PCs are shown in
Figure 1 and Figure S2.

3.3.

Genome-wide imputation

We used IMPUTE2 (v2.3.2) 83 to impute genotypes at all variants present in the combined
reference panel. To do this efficiently, we split the data into subsets of 500 samples, and split the
genome into a total of 1456 chunks of 2Mb each. We ran IMPUTE2 in each chunk and sample
subset specifying a buffer region of 500kb and an effective population size of 20,000. Finally, we
used QCTOOL to merge imputation chunks across sample subsets and across chunks, encoding the
results in BGEN format 84. For post-imputation analysis we additionally merged all impute ‘info’
files across chunks and sample subsets into a single file.
We also repeated the above process using the 1000 Genomes Phase III reference panel (as available
from the IMPUTE2 website 3rd August 2015), using the same settings throughout.

3.4.

Assessment of imputation performance

To assess per-variant imputation performance we focused on ‘type 0 r2’ (which measures
correlation between input genotypes and re-imputed genotype dosages), which we refer to here as
accuracy. We plotted mean accuracy in 1% minor allele frequency (MAF) bins for each subset of
samples imputed (Figure S1). We also plotted the proportion of variants meeting a given accuracy
threshold for lower-frequency (<10% MAF) and higher-frequency (10-50% MAF) variants. Under
the assumption that untyped variants behave similarly to typed variants, these plots suggest that a
substantial proportion of variation in the genome is imputed to high accuracy using this panel.
To compare imputation performance between panels we additionally computed the mean difference
in accuracy, within minor allele frequency bins, for each imputation sample subset (Figure S1).
We also used the per-sample imputation results output by IMPUTE2 to compare imputation
performance across ethnic groups. IMPUTE2 outputs an accuracy measure (also called type 0 r2,

the correlation between input genotypes and re-imputed genotype dosages across variants within
each chunk. We plotted the distribution of per-sample accuracy, averaged across chunks, for
samples in each of the largest ethnic groups in our data (Figure 1).

3.5.

Visualisation of study and reference panel haplotype similarity

To further understand the effects of additional African reference panel samples on imputation
performance, we constructed a joint dataset consisting of phased haplotypes at all 17,960 study
individuals and all 3,046 reference panel individuals, subsetted to the overlapping set of 1,492,601
SNPs. For each pair (S,P) of a study panel haplotype S and a reference panel population P, we
computed the proportion of 1Mb chunks such that the closest reference panel haplotype to S lies in
P. Proximity was measured by absolute number of differences with ties broken by randomly
choosing one of the closest haplotypes. We averaged the proportions over samples in each study
ethnicity (Figure 1c).

3.6.

Imputation of classical HLA alleles

We used HLA*IMP:02 to impute HLA classical alleles for all study samples. We based
imputation on the unphased, QCd set of genotype data across populations in the region chr6:28Mb36Mb. This version of HLAIMP outputs imputed diploid allele calls, and posterior probabilities,
for alleles at 2-digit and 4-digit resolution, and uses an allele naming scheme that is similar to the
pre-2010 IPD-IMGT/HLA naming convention.
For downstream analysis, we split HLA*IMP output into per-allele posterior probabilities.
Specifically, for each allele we computed the posterior probability of zero, one or two copies of the
allele, against all other alleles at the locus, from the HLA*IMP output. We encoded this data in the
GP field of a VCF file with one row per allele. This functionality may be generally useful and we
implemented it in QCTOOL. For later reference, we assigned each allele to the midpoint of the
corresponding gene.

3.7.

Imputation of glycophorin structural variants

We used IMPUTE to impute genotypes into our previously described reference panel in the
glycophorin region on chromosome 414. Specifically, we based our imputation on the phased set of
haplotypes, but to avoid potential issues with phasing in this region of copy number variation and
segmental duplication we treated these genotypes as unphased. We then ran IMPUTE2 in 2Mb
chunks across a 10Mb region surrounding the glycophorins, specifying 1000 reference panel
haplotypes, a 500kb buffer region, an effective population size of 20,000, and using the HapMap
combined recombination map.

4. Association testing
4.1.

Association with severe malaria status

We used SNPTEST (See Online Resources) to test each imputed variant for association with
severe malaria status in each study population. Specifically, for each population we ran SNPTEST
for each of the 2Mb chunks output by imputation, including either 0, 2, 5 or 10 population-specific
PCs as covariates, and under additive, dominant, recessive, heterozygote and general models of
association. For the main analyses presented here we used the versions based on including 5 PCs.
A total of 17,056 samples had principal components and assigned case/control status, and were
included in association analyses. We tested under additive, dominant, recessive and heterozygote
inheritance models.

4.2.

Association with severe malaria subphenotypes

To test association with the main severe malaria subphenotypes in our data - namely cerebral
malaria (CM) and severe malarial anaemia (SMA), and other severe malaria cases (OTHER) - we
extended SNPTEST to perform maximum likelihood inference for multinomial logistic regression.
A full description of this method is presented in Text S6. In brief, in this framework, the
likelihood is parameterized by the log-odds of each case phenotype (CM, SMA or OTHER)
relative to the baseline phenotype (CONTROL), for the genotypic predictor along with other
covariates. The method produces maximum likelihood estimates of these parameters, and estimated
parameter standard errors and covariances. Overall evidence for association can then be assessed
by computing a likelihood ratio test statistic, and associated P-value, against the null model where
all genetic effect size parameters are zero. Additionally, for each case phenotype we compute a
Wald test statistic and P-value against the null model that the genetic effect on that phenotype is
zero.
Of the 17,056 samples included in association testing, 537 had no subphenotype assignment or
were assigned as having both CM and SMA phenotypes. For simplicity we excluded these samples
from the genome-wide test against subphenotypes. We tested under additive, dominant, recessive
and heterozygote inheritance models.

4.3.
X chromosome tests

We additionally tested variants on the X chromosome using a logistic regression model including
sex as a covariate, and treating male hemizygote genotypes in the same way as homozygous
females.

5. Meta-analysis of association results
5.1.

Overview of meta-analysis

To efficiently meta-analyse the association results, we further developed our software package
BINGWA (see Online resources). BINGWA is written in C++ and is available at
http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~gav/bingwa/#overview. BINGWA takes a list of SNPTEST files, along
with options that control variant filtering and output, and computes meta-analysis results using both
frequentist and bayesian methods.
Per-population results for each variant were included in meta-analysis if the minor allele count (or
for nonadditive tests, the minor predictor count as defined below) was at least 25, the IMPUTE info
was at least 0.3, and no issues were reported with model fitting. For nonadditive tests we defined
the minor predictor count as the minimum of the expected number of individuals having the effect
genotype (e.g. AB or BB for dominant model of the B allele; BB for recessive model etc.) and the
number having the baseline genotype (e.g. AA for a dominant model of the B allele; AA or AB for
recessive model etc).

5.2.

Frequentist meta-analysis

For each case/control or subphenotype test, we computed a frequentist fixed-effect meta-analysis
estimate βmeta, its variance-covariance matrix Vmeta, and overall meta-analysis P-value as described
in Text S7. For subphenotype tests, βmeta is 3-dimensional (corresponding to joint estimates for
cerebral malaria, severe malarial anaemia, and other severe malaria cases) . We additionally
computed a Wald test P-value for each estimated parameter.

5.3.

Bayesian meta-analysis

To assess evidence for association under a more flexible set of models of association, we used a
Bayesian meta-analysis framework similar to that described previously 7,9,10. In brief, we
implemented Bayesian inference using the asymptotic or approximate Bayes factor approach 85.
This approach treats the observed effect sizes (as estimated by logistic or multinomial logistic
regression in each population) as arising from a set of true population effect sizes, together with
estimation noise that is represented by the standard errors and parameter covariances estimated in
each population. The ‘true’ population effects are modeled as being drawn from a multivariate
normal distribution with mean zero and a prior covariance matrix Σ which is chosen to represent a
desired model of true effects. We write this covariance in the form

Σ=σΡσ
Here Ρ is a correlation matrix specifying the prior correlation in true effect sizes between
populations and/or between subphenotypes, and σ is a scalar (or, in the general case, a diagonal
matrix) which determines the prior variance of effect sizes, and thus the overall magnitude of
modeled true effects.
Given the vector of per-population estimates β and the parameter covariance matrix V, a Bayes
factor for the model encoded by Σ can now be computed as a ratio of multivariate normal densities

BF = MVN(β;0,(V-1+Σ-1)-1) / MVN(β;0,V)
Different choices of Σ correspond to different assumptions about the underlying true effect sizes.
The true pattern of effects is unknown, so we assess evidence under a collection of plausible
assumptions Σ1, Σ2, … by computing the model-averaged Bayes factor

BFavg = w1 BF1 + w2 BF2 + …
in which BFi is the BF computed using prior covariance Σi , and the prior weights wi are chosen
to sum to 1.
The specific choices of prior correlation matrix Ρ and weights w used for our primary analysis are
described in subsequent sections and in Table S9. Unless otherwise specified, for each choice of Ρ
we computed the BF for that model as an equally-weighted average over four values of σ – namely
0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8.

5.4.
Mode of inheritance

We repeated all analyses under additive, dominant, recessive and heterozygote modes of
inheritance with prior weights 0.4, 0.2, 0.2 and 0.2 respectively.

5.5.

Population effects

For case/control tests we considered the following models of effects across all populations:
- fixed effects (all off-diagonal entries of Ρ set to 0.99)
- correlated effects (all off-diagonal entries of Ρ set to 0.9)
- independent effects (all off-diagonal entries of Ρ set to 0)
- structured effects (Ρ estimated from the correlation in allele frequencies genome-wide)
We placed a total of 60% prior weight on fixed and correlated effects and 4% prior weight on each
of independent and structured effects.
In addition to effects across all populations, we included models of effect restricted to population
subgroups. Specifically we focused on the following groupings:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

West African populations (Gambia and Mali, or Gambia, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Ghana)
West and central west African populations (Gambia, Mali, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Nigeria
and Cameroon)
Central west African populations (Burkina Faso, Ghana, Nigeria and Cameroon)
Central and east African populations (Nigeria, Cameroon, Malawi, Tanzania, and Kenya)
East African populations (Malawi, Tanzania, and Kenya)
All African populations (Gambia, Mali, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Nigeria, Cameroon,
Malawi, Tanzania and Kenya)
Non-African populations (Vietnam, PNG)

These subsets are chosen to correspond to geographical groupings, as well as to groups apparent
along the first principal component of African populations (Figure 1e), and such that no group has
fewer than 2,000 samples. We placed 4% prior weight on each of the eight groups, for a total
weight of 1 (Table S9).

5.6.

Subphenotype effects

We placed 80% of prior mass on case/control effects, but also considered effects that vary across
subphenotypes (CM, SMA and other SM), as well as effects that are only present for only two or
one of the subphenotypes (Table S9). Specifically, we considered:
- Effects on all three subphenotypes (between-phenotype entries of Ρ set to 0.9 or 0).
- Effects on two of three subphenotypes (σ set to 0 for one phenotype, between-phenotype
entries of Ρ set to 0.9 or 0).
- Effects restricted to one subphenotype (σ set to 0 for two phenotypes)
We assigned these categories prior weights of 8%, 6% and 6% respectively. To avoid spurious
results, when conducting subphenotype meta-analysis we assumed that effects were fixed across
populations. Specifically, between-population within-phenotype entries of Ρ were set to 0.99, and
between-population between-phenotype entries of Ρ were set to 0.99 times the between-assumed
phenotype correlation specified above.

5.7.

Interpretation of the bayesian model average

The results of using the set of models and prior weights described above to compute BFavg are
shown in Figure 2. Conditional on this set of prior assumptions, the Bayes factor can be interpreted
directly in terms of a prior odds of association as

Posterior odds = prior odds × BFavg
In the absence of other information about a given genetic variant, plausible values of the prior odds
might be in the range 10-5-10-7 as described previously15,86. For a Bayes factor of 1x105 this would
therefore give posterior odds of association between one and one-hundredth (i.e. posterior
probability of 1-50%). This computation thus reflects our belief about the top signals in our data,
namely, that there is overwhelmingly strong evidence for signals at HBB, ABO, ATP2B4 and at the
glycophorin region (for which BFavg >5x107), good evidence at ARL14 and rs62418762 (BFavg >
5x106), and some evidence at further loci among the top twelve (BFavg > 1x105). Except for the
association at ARL14, these observations are further reinforced by the replication data (Figure 2c).
Given the assumptions underlying BFavg, the relative evidence for different models can also be
interpreted as in Figure 2. For example, since the Africa-only model has prior weight 0.04 * 0.8 =
0.032 (averaged over mode of inheritance), the observation of 90% posterior probability on an

around 280 times larger than under any other model. Indeed, under a dominance model of
case/control effects, the computed Bayes factors are 4.5x1017 and 1.2x1020 for effects across all
populations and across Africa only, a relative difference of 265. (The Bayes factor for fixed effects
across Africa and Vietnam combined is 2.6x1019; though we did not include this model in BFavg).
To allow further assessment of the dependency of BFavg on the model assumptions, the full metaanalysis output produced by BINGWA includes
- A full set of BFs, computed under a larger set of models, including those making up the
BFavg.
- The model with the highest BF.
- The model with the highest posterior weight (i.e. highest BF after the weighting), and the
model second highest posterior weight.
- A per-population BF reflecting the evidence from each individual population. (As for
BFavg these are computed by model averaging over parameters σ = 0.2,0.4, 0.6, 0.8. For
subphenotype tests we assume independence between effects in different
subphenotypes).
- Meta-analysis effect size estimates and standard errors, computed under the frequentist
fixed-effect model, with associated P-values.
- A summary of the set of populations and number of samples which were included in metaanalysis.
- Additional information, including genotype counts and INFO scores, taken from the
SNPTEST result files.
Together these quantities allow a detailed assessment of the underlying signals. In our
implementation, BINGWA was used to store meta-analysis for each mode of inheritance in a sqlite
database, with results indexed by variant position and identifiers. We used sqlite features to
construct the final meta-analysis.

5.8.

Bayesian replication analysis

The Bayesian framework outlined above naturally extends to a discovery/replication setting; this is
described further below and in Text S5.

6. Selection, annotation, and interpretation of associated regions
6.1.

Variant filtering

The combined meta-analysis results contain many variants of low frequency or low imputation
quality, potentially leading to spurious association results. To identify a set of variants with highquality evidence, we first filtered based on minor allele count and imputation quality as follows. In
each population we computed an effective minor allele count by the formula

Effective minor allele count = IMPUTE info × minor allele count
where the 'minor allele count' refers to the number of the less frequent allele seen in that
population. For imputed variants, this is the expected number given the imputed genotype
distribution. We then formed an overall effective minor allele count (EMAC) by summing this
quantity across all eleven populations in our study (or, for variants where individual populations
were omitted from meta-analysis, across all populations included in the meta-analysis.)
For downstream analyses we considered all variants with EMAC >= 250. This is a relatively
relaxed criterion: for example, for a variant with IMPUTE info=1 in each population, this
corresponds to an overall minor allele frequency of 250/(2*17056) = 0.75%. Using the combined
genome-wide reference panel, a total of 26,035,208 variants passed this filter.

6.2.

Definition and annotation of association regions

We ranked the filtered list of variants by BFavg and used inthinnerator (see Online resources) to
define a set of 'lead' variants and association regions. Inthinnerator works by iteratively picking the
variant with the highest rank and excluding all other variants in a recombination interval around
them. We specified a recombination interval of 0.125cM plus a margin of 25kb on either side of
each picked variant, with distances determined by interpolating the HapMap combined
recombination map.
Association regions around HBB and around the glycophorin gene cluster on chromosome 4 are
especially extensive. We treated these regions specially, defining them as the regions
chr11:3.5Mb-6.5Mb and chr4:143.5Mb-146Mb respectively based on visual inspection of the
association signal, and we excluded these regions from the inthinnerator region definition process.

A total of 95 regions defined in this way contained a variant with BFavg > 1,000. These regions are
listed in Table S2.

6.3.

Visual assessment of signals of association

We created a set of plots showing the evidence for association in each region of association.
Specifically, we created 'hit plots' showing:
- The association signal (log10 BFavg), colouring points by LD with the lead variant
computed using the African reference panel haplotypes, and annotating variants that were
directly typed and included in our phased set.
- Recombination rates from the HapMap combined recombination map.
- Regional genes and pseudogenes, taken from the UCSC Genome Browser refGene track
downloaded on 9th June 2016.
- A set of annotations reflecting functional information (described further below).
For each lead variant we created forest plots showing, for each mode of inheritance,
- the effect size estimate and confidence interval estimated in each population,
- the number of samples, variant frequency and IMPUTE info in each population
- the frequentist meta-analysis results
- a bar plot summarising the Bayesian meta-analysis results.
As described above, we also produced and inspected cluster plots of typed variants with evidence
of association.
To annotate hitplots with functional information, we considered:
- Variants with impact rating ‘MODERATE’ or ‘HIGH’ according to Variant Effect
Predictor 26 as described below.
- Variants previously reported as associated with traits in the NHGRI/EBI GWAS catalog 37
and a previously reported GWAS of haematopetic traits 35.
- Variants previously identified as having evidence for ancient balancing selection65
- RNA expression levels, transcription factor binding sites, and chromatin state in
erythrocyte precursors and other cells28-30.
- Topologically associated domains 87
- Reported eQTLs across cell types 31-33

6.4.

Prediction of variant functional consequence

6.5.

Processing of RNA-seq data from erythrocyte precursors

We used Variant Effect Predictor 26 from Ensembl tools release 75 to predict the functional
consequence of variants in each association region. Specifically, we used our meta-analysis
database to generate a VCF file containing all typed and imputed variants within each association
region, and ran VEP using the –everything flag. We then included VEP results into the combined
meta-analysis database. In addition to functional annotation, VEP has the useful property that it
returns common identifiers (e.g. dbSNP ‘rs’ IDs) for variants that may have specialized IDs in the
imputation reference panel.
We obtained raw RNA-seq data from erythrocyte precursors 30,88 from the Gene Expression
Omnibus using the sra toolkit. In total data on eight cell types was processed: CD34+, BFU-E,
CFU-E, early basophilic, late basophilic, proerythroblast, polychromatic, and orthochromatic
erythrocyte progenitor cells, with three replicates of each30,88. We also downloaded data on 12 fetal
and 12 adult experimentally differentiated erythroblasts reported by Lessard et al31. To process
these data, we extracted FASTQ files from the SRA archives and mapped reads to the build 37
reference sequence using TopHat v2.0.14, using the Gencode v19 release of the human reference
sequence and gene annotations. For the Lessard et al data we included the options --library-type
fr-firststrand and --microexon-search to match the original processing31.
We also downloaded RNA-seq data from circulating erythrocytes 44 from the Gene Expression
Omnibus. We mapped these data to the build 37 reference sequence using bwa-mem 74 and marked
duplicates using Picard (https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard).
To visualize coverage profiles across ATP2B4, we restricted attention to reads with mapping
quality at least 50, and used bedtools genomecov89 to compute coverage across the gene and across
the genome. We then plotted per-base coverage divided by the total coverage across ATP2B4
exons, summed over samples within each dataset and developmental stage (Figure 5).
To compute eQTL results in ATP2B4 exons in the 24 samples from Lessard et al31, we computed
FPKM in each exon as

(# reads mapping to exon×106) / (exon length in kb × total number of reads)
We then used a linear model to compute residual FPKM after regressing out the developmental
stage (fetal or adult) 31. For comparison across exons we additionally standardised this residual
FPKM across samples (i.e. by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard error across
samples). We then computed eQTL results by fitting a linear model of genotype on the
standardized, residual FPKM values.

Processing of normalised RNA-seq coverage profiles

We downloaded normalized RNA-seq coverage profiles for 56 cell types, representing 12 tissues
and the ENCODE cell lines, from the roadmap epigenomics browser28 at http://egg2.wustl.edu.
We used the stranded normalized coverage files.
For visualization of coverage profiles (Figure 5) we combined coverage across strands by
summing the two strands. To summarise coverage across tissues, we used the tissue assignments
in the "jul2013.roadmapData.qc - Consolidated_EpigenomeIDs_summary_Table.csv" file, and
computed the maximum per-base normalized coverage across all cells within each tissue. We
treated ENCODE cell lines as a single group here, except that we treated the K562 cell line
separately as it has an expression programme similar to erythroid cells.

7. Generation and analysis of replication data
7.1.

Selection and genotyping of SNPs for replication

For validation of imputed results and additional replication, SNPs were genotyped on the
Sequenom® iPLEX Mass-Array platform (Agena Biosciences, Hamburg, Germany) as described
elsewhere 90. We used a preliminary version of the analysis described above to select association
regions to target for replication. In brief, we identified the 100 regions with the most evidence for
association under a case/control model of association, using inthinnerator to identify lead variants
within regions. In each region we considered up to 5 SNPs for replication, including the lead SNP
and others with substantial evidence for association. We further ranked regions using BFavg
restricted to non-case/control models of association and selected additional SNPs making up to 5 in
each region, where not already selected by the case/control scan.
We designed primer sets as described previously 7, omitting variants in regions previously assayed
7,10
. Altogether we designed two multiplexes targeting 76 variants. We used these multiplexes to
genotype all samples collected in the project 7, including those included in discovery and additional
replication samples. Three variants failed genotyping (as determined by > 20% rate of missing
genotypes across samples) and were excluded from downstream analysis, leaving data for 73
variants in 35 genomic regions. Genotype calls for these assays, along with data for the SNPs
previously assessed 7,10 were combined in a single database for downstream processing.

7.2.

Curation of Sequenom results

We processed Sequenom genotypes as follows. Data was available for a total of 38,155 samples,
most of whom represent severe malaria cases and population controls. All samples have a gender
assignment by genotyping of amelogenin SNPs7. A small number of individuals were typed from
multiple samples. For these individuals, we first removed samples with discrepancies between the
clinical record of gender and the amelogenin-based gender assignment, and then merged genotypes
across the remaining samples by taking a consensus call across the repeat typing (i.e. treating
discordant calls as missin). Finally, we treated samples as low quality, and excluded from
downstream analysis, if greater than 10% of genotype calls were missing across variants for which
an attempt to type the sample had been made.

7.3.

Validation of imputation results

For each imputed lead variant, we computed the correlation between imputed genotypes and
Sequenom-typed genotypes, for all variants within 100kb of the lead variant, within each
population and across samples. We treated signals as potentially replicable if a SNP with r2>0.75
with the lead imputed SNP was present (Table S2).

7.4.

Frequentist replication analysis

We used SNPTEST to compute association test results based on the Sequenom genotypes, in
discovery samples, replication samples, and across all samples in each population, including ethnic
group as a covariate. We then used BINGWA to meta-analyse these results. A commonly-used
frequentist assessment of replication is to look for a nominally significant one-tailed P-value in the
direction of effect observed in discovery. These values are reported in Table S2 for the regions
identified in discovery with BFavg > 1,000, where a sequenom tag SNP exists.

7.5.
Bayesian replication
analysis

We extended the Bayesian analysis described above to a full discovery / replication analysis. A
full description of this method can be found in Text S5, but in brief, this analysis produces a
discovery BF (BFavg as described above), an overall BF across discovery and replication samples
(BFoverall), and a replication BF (BFreplication) which is computed under the posterior effect size
distribution learnt from discovery samples. These quantities satisfy

BFoverall = BFavg × BFreplication
Intuitively, BFreplication measures the evidence for association under the set of models and effect size
distribution learnt from discovery samples.
In practice, requiring replication effect sizes to match the distribution learnt from discovery may be
too restrictive - for example this could happen if discovery effects sizes at chosen SNPs are
affected by Winner's curse, or because the distribution of phenotypes in replication samples differs
from that in discovery. We therefore assessed replication data assuming true effect sizes in
discovery and replication samples had a correlation of 0.9. The effects of this assumption are
discussed in Text S5.

7.6.

Replication evidence at rs62418762

We used both frequentist and Bayesian analyses to assess overall and replication evidence at
rs62418762 (Figure 3), as described above. Discovery data suggests a positive (i.e. risk) effect of
the nonref allele at rs62418762 on both CM and SMA susceptibility. We therefore also computed
a replication P-value for the alternative model ‘CM and SMA effects are positive’ (Figure 3). To
do this, we simulated 10,000,000 parameter values under the null model, using a 2-dimensional
normal distribution with mean zero and covariance set to the estimated covariance matrix of the
replication loglikelihood from meta-analysis. We estimated the P-value as the proportion of
simulated parameter values which lay in the positive quadrant and were more extreme than the
observed quantities (in the sense that they are points at lower density than the observed effect sizes
under this normal distribution.)

8. Modelling effects at replicating loci
We fit a joint model of effect of the 5 replicating variants on CM, SMA and nonspecific cases, and
on samples having both CM and SMA phenotypes. Additionally, two other variants (rs33930165,
encoding haemoglobin C (HbC), and rs8176746, which is indicative of A/B blood type, were
included as they have been previously implicated in malaria susceptibility 7,51. We fit the joint
model across all populations, using the nnet package in R and including 5 principal components
from each population and the study population indicator as covariates. We treated effects as
additive, except that variants with a clearly nonadditive effect (as in Figure 2c) were encoded
using the predicted protective dosage. We used the estimated effect on CM to determine the
protective allele and for this analysis we assumed effects were fixed across populations. Results are
shown in Figure 4a. This analysis suggests little evidence of association with rs8176746,
indicating that observed effects at this SNP are likely due to linkage disequilibrium with the O
blood group mutation rs8176719.
We used control samples to compute the frequency of the protective dosage (or the allele frequency
for variants with additive effects) across populations. To visualize frequencies, we computed the
minimum, maximum and mean frequency for each variant across populations, and plotted
frequencies as circles with width proportional to the maximum frequency (Figure 4b).
To visualise the potential for interaction between the variants, we computed the combined
genotype for each sample across these variants, omitting rs8176746 (Figure 4c). Combined
genotypes with less than 50 samples were collapsed into a single, 'other genotype' category. We
refit the model across populations using these genotypes as predictors and plotted the estimated
effect sizes and confidence intervals, against the expectation given the estimates from individual
variants and the assumption that variants contribute independently to the log-odds of disease.

9. Mendelian randomization with blood cell traits
We conducted mendelian randomization (MR) analysis (which, under restrictive assumptions, can
provide evidence of a causal link between two traits91) using summary statistics for 36 red blood
cell (rbc), white blood cell (wbc), and platelet traits previously published 35. To do this, we treated
each rbc, wbc or platelet trait separately. For each trait T, we assumed a model of an effect of T on
SM, such that a unit increase in T increases the log-odds of SM by a quantity ρ. If this is the case
then for any genetic variant affecting T we should have

β
(**)
SM = ρ × βT + ζ

where βT and βSM denote the effect of the variant on T and on severe malaria, and ζ represents any
additional effect of the variant on SM, over and above the effect through T. Under the assumptions
traditionally underlying mendelian randomization analysis 91, ζ=0 and we assumed this
throughout.
We used a Gaussian likelihood formulation of MR92 under which the effect size estimates (β'T and
β'SM) are assumed distributed around the true effects according to the estimated standard errors, as:

𝛽!
𝛽!
𝑠𝑒!!
~𝑀𝑉𝑁
;
𝛽!"
0
𝛽!"

0
!
𝑠𝑒!"

and true effects are assumed to follow:

𝛽!
𝜎!!
~𝑀𝑉𝑁 0;
𝛽!"
𝜌𝜎!!

𝜌𝜎!!
𝜌! 𝜎!!

(***)

The latter equation reflects equation (**) when ζ=0, and the assumption that effects follow a
Gaussian distribution.
To estimate ρ we focused on the 2,706 'sentinel' variants identified as associated with blood traits
by Astle et al35. A subset of 2,130 of these variants were included in the meta-analysis in our study
after filtering by effective minor allele count. We removed 89 variants lying in any of the 95
regions of association containing a variant with BFavg > 1x103 in our discovery analysis (including
the ATP2B4 region). We treated the remaining variants as independent, and estimated ρ and σ2T
by minimizing (***) using the optim() function in R. To compute a P-value for model fit, we refit
the model assuming no correlation (ρ=0) and computed the likelihood ratio P-value.
We visualized effect size and the model fit by plotting the effect size estimates on T and on SM
across variants, overlaid with a line indicating the estimated value of ρ and its 95% confidence
interval. To avoid visualization problems stemming from large estimates at variants with high
standard errors, we used effect size estimates regularized using a N(0,0.1) prior in plots. These
estimates are plotted in Figure 5h (for mean corpuscular haemoglobin) and Figure S12 (for all
traits tested).
For T=mchc, our estimate of effect variance was σ2T = 0.0132. We plotted the empirical
distribution of observed effects overlaid with the Gaussian density and observed some evidence
that effects are overdispersed relative to the Gaussian distribution with this variance. To verify that
this did not adversely affect results, we refit the model assuming a fixed prior value σ2T = 0.12, with
similar results (ρ=-0.13, P = 7x10-3).

10. HLA region analysis
10.1.

Association analysis

For each imputed HLA allele we tested for association and conducted meta-analysis as described
above for genome-wide SNPs and indels.

10.2.

Comparison with previous data on West African populations

For each 2-digit HLA allele in our HLA*IMP-imputed data in Gambia, we computed the
corresponding antigen frequency as the proportion of individuals heterozygote or homozygote for
the allele. We plotted these frequencies in control samples from each Gambian ethnic group
against previously published HLA Class I antigen frequencies in the same populations (Table 1 of
Hill et al 1).
We noted that a pair of alleles were particularly discordant (the B*15 allele, which is at relatively
high frequency in our imputation and the B70 antigen, which is at relatively high frequency in the
serotyped data. We used the IPD-IMGT/HLA dictionary to confirm that the B70 antigen is
expressed by B*15 alleles. We therefore computed the combined B70/B15 frequencies in Figure
6b. For each ethnic group we then computed squared correlation between imputed and serotyped
antigen frequencies.

10.3. HLA typing in 32available
Gambian
children

31 Gambian case samples for which both parents have previously been genotyped (EGA dataset
EGAD00000000019) were selected based on available DNA quantities. These samples were typed
at 11 HLA gene loci through exon sequencing. Sequenced regions included exons 2-4 of HLA-A, B, -C, -DPB1; exons 2-3 of HLA-DUPA1, -DQA1, DQB1 and DRB1, and exon 2 of HLA-DRB3,
-DRB4, and -DRB5. Typing was performed by the Accredited Tissue Typing Laboratory at
Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, using the
proprietary uTYPE software version 7 (Fisher Scientific. Pittsburgh, USA). The list of possible
ambiguous calls were minimised by using the ‘allele pair’ export function in this software, which
lists all possible and permissible allele pair possibilities for each locus for each individual. Alleles
were defined using the IMGT/HLA Release: 3.22.0 2015 October 10. Best-call allele pairs for each
locus in each individual were determined based on local guidelines prioritising alleles that were
"Common and Well-Documented" (CWD).

11. Analysis of Glycophorin structural variants
We tested for association and conducted meta-analysis for glycophorin region variants in the same
way as described above for other variants. Four CNVs were imputed with reasonable frequency
and imputation quality (DUP1; the glycophorin B deletions DEL1 and DEL2; and DUP4).
Glycophorin region SNPs appear in our meta-analysis results twice - once using the genome-wide
combined reference panel, and once based on this imputation of glycophorin variants. In our main
presentation for consistency we refer to the genome-wide panel imputation results, except for
glycophorin CNVs which are imputed from the glycophorin panel.

12. Analysis of polygenicity of severe malaria
We aimed to assess the degree to which additional polygenic effects explain severe malaria
susceptibility. The epidemiology of malaria differs between sub-Saharan Africa and outside, and
we chose to restrict attention to the African populations in our data for this analysis. We further
restricted attention to a subset of 13,088 samples having pairwise relatedness less than 0.05
(estimated in each population based on the kinship matrix used to compute principal components
from phased genotypes, as described above). We used the genotypes at directly typed SNPs in the
phased dataset for heritability estimation.
We used two previously published methods (GCTA93 and PCGC 20, in the implementation by
Gaurav Bhatia (https://github.com/gauravbhatia1/PCGCRegression)) to estimate the heritability of
SM. These methods are both based on the "infinitesimal" model of genotype-trait association,
under which all variants contribute equally, in expectation, to trait variation. However, they differ
in how estimation is performed. In particular, PCGC is thought to be more robust for case/control
traits and we use it for our main results.
We estimated heritability based on the phased dataset in several ways:
- in each chromosome separately
- in a joint model in which all chromosome were included as separate components
- in a joint model in which the four previously confirmed association regions, and the rest
of the genome, were included as separate components
- in a joint model in which regions near protein-coding genes, and the rest of the genome
were included as separate components
- in a joint model in which variants in different minor allele frequency bins were allocated
to different components.
For our main analysis we included an indicator of callset and 20 PCs, as computed across the
13,088 samples, as covariates. GCTA takes covariates into account directly; to adjust for
covariates in PCGC, we used the --adjust-grm option in LDAK22 to subtract covariates from the
relatedness matrix. (However, we did not further explore using the LDAK model for heritability
estimation). For some analyses we also included the protective dosages of risk alleles at HbS,
rs8176719 (ABO), rs4951377 (ATP2B4) and DUP4 as covariates.
We also explored including 10 or 50 PCs as covariates, with little difference in results (data not
shown). We observed slightly smaller estimates of heritability using GCTA than PCGC, consistent
with the previously reported theory and observations20. Although our populations are highly
structured, estimated of per-chromosome heritability when fitting chromosomes independently or
jointly were similar (Figure S4). This suggests that any between-chromosome correlations
between variants, which can occur as a result of population structure, are being adequately
controlled for by our inclusion of covariates.

13. Analysis of allele frequency differentiation
13.1.

Overview

We used the reference panel data to construct a joint derived allele count spectrum between African
and non-African populations (Figure S7), and we used the genotypes of control samples at a set of
randomly selected sites to construct an empirical model of allele frequencies across African
populations (Figures S8-9 and S11). We then annotated variants across the genome with metrics
of differentiation between continents and within Africa based on these models.

13.2.

Between-continent differentiation

To assess between-continent differentiation, we first computed the empirical allele count
distribution between African and each non-African group G, based on all reference panel variants
which had an ancestral allele assignment and which were not masked by the 1000 Genomes strict
mask. Let D = Dij be the matrix of allele counts, where i ranges from 0 to the number of haplotypes
in G and j ranges from 0 to the number of haplotypes in African reference panel individuals. Given
a derived allele x with counts a=G(x) and b=AFR(x), we then compute upper and lower ranks of
the allele in G as

rank+G(x) = ( ½ Dab + Σi>a Dib ) / (Σi Dib)
and

rank-G(x) = ( ½Dab + Σi<a Dib) / (Σi Dib)
These quantities reflect the rank of the allele x among all alleles with the same African allele count,
and satisfy rank+G(x) + rank-G(x) = 1. Visually, they correspond to the position of the allele in the
vertical 'slice' through the joint derived allele count matrix (Figure S7).
To compute the African allele counts in D we used only samples from non-admixed African
populations (i.e. excluding ACB and ASW populations).
The matrix D is computed from data on genome-wide variants. If these are primarily neutrally
evolving mutations, then D forms an estimate of the distribution of allele counts under neutrality,
andrank+G(x) can be interpreted as an empirical P-value reflecting the alternative hypothesis that
the allele count G(x) is higher than expected, given AFR(x). Similarly we interpret rank-G(x) as an
empirical P-value reflecting the alternative hypothesis that G(x) is lower than expected, given
AFR(x).
For a malaria-associated variant, the malaria hypothesis suggests that natural selection will
maintain the protective allele at higher frequency in populations of high childhood mortality (such
as African populations in our data) due to malaria. To avoid confounding by selection of variants
through GWAS, we instead condition on the African allele frequency and ask whether the allele is
at lower frequency in non-endemic populations. For any variant v with derived allele x, we
therefore define rankG(v) = rank-G(x), if x is the estimated protective allele, or rankG(v) = rank+G(x)
if x is the estimated risk allele. We will therefore have rankG(v) < 0.5 if the protective allele is at
below-median rank in group G among all variants with the same African allele count AFR(x).
Where unclear we determine the direction of effect of x based on the effect size estimated for
cerebral malaria.

13.3.

Within-Africa differentiation

To assess differentiation within Africa we implemented a model similar to that underlying Bayenv
94
but with simplifications that we now describe. The Bayenv model assumes that the vector of
underlying allele frequencies in sampled populations (denoted F) follows a multivariate normal
distribution of the form

F ~ MVN(f0, f0(1-f0)Ω) (*)
Here f0 denotes the conceptual ancestral allele frequency (assumed to reflect a time point T before
the populations from which study samples were drawn separated), and the matrix Ω captures the
effects on allele frequency of the coancestry of populations since T. In particular, diagonal entries
of Ω reflect levels of genetic drift (relative to the population at time point T) and off-diagonal
entries reflect shared ancestry between populations.
The model above is expected to hold approximately provided f0 is not too small and the levels of
genetic drift are not too large94. Because the coancestry matrix Ω is assumed to be the same across

all neutrally evolving variants,available
it can be
estimated
a set of neutral
SNPs
across the genome.

Specifically, for each variant, a vector of scaled frequencies can be computed as

F' = (F - f0) / √(f0(1-f0))
Under the model above, Ω can now be estimated as the covariance of scaled allele frequencies,

Ω = cov(F')
To implement this in practice, we made the following simplifying assumptions. First, we restricted
attention to the 7 African study populations with > 200 control samples (namely Gambia, Burkina
Faso, Ghana, Cameroon, Malawi, Tanzania, and Kenya), and assumed that the population allele
frequency vector F is accurately estimated by the observed allele frequencies. (We used only
control samples in frequency estimates). Second, we assumed that the ancestral allele frequency f0
is well estimated as the mean of the per-population frequency estimates. Thirdly, we restricted
attention to directly typed SNPs with mean allele frequency in the range 2-98%, and ignored the
effects of allele frequencies reaching the boundary at frequency 0 or 1. We sampled a subset of
100,000 such SNPs randomly across the genome with the above properties and computed Ω as the
empirical covariance in scaled estimated allele frequencies. The estimated matrix Ω' is visualized
in Figure S8. We note that the Bayenv method avoids these assumptions by integrating over the
uncertainty in ancestral and current allele frequencies94, and by modeling the population
frequencies as bounded between 0 and 1, but requires a computationally expensive MCMC
process.
In practice, systematic effects in F' may arise due to the selection of variants used in estimation. In
addition to Ω' we therefore additionally estimated the mean scaled frequency, denoted μ.
The estimated covariance matrix Ω provides a model for allele frequency variation of putatively
neutral alleles in the populations considered. We visualized this model by plotting the joint
distribution of observed and simulated allele frequencies. Specifically, we simulated 1,000,000
variants by sampling f0 from the observed list of mean allele frequencies, and then sampling allele
frequencies by drawing from the model (*). We then plotted the joint allele frequency distribution
in the two most divergent populations, Gambia and Kenya (Figure S8).
We tested each typed or imputed variant against this model as follows. First, we computed the
mean allele frequency and scaled allele frequency vector F'. The model above assumes that

F' ~ MVN(μ, Ω')
Or equivalently,

X ~ MVN(0, Id)
where X = L-1 (F'- μ) and LLt = Ω denotes the Cholesky decomposition of Ω. In practice, the use
of mean allele frequency implies that Ω has rank one less than the number of populations 94 and we
therefore remove one population from the vector F' and from Ω before computing this
decomposition. In the results presented here, we chose to remove Cameroon, which is the most
central population both geographically and within Ω (Figure S8). Under the model, the sum of
squared entries of X, i.e. XtX, is now distributed as χ2 distribution with 6 degrees of freedom. We
denote the corresponding P-value as PXtX.
Figure S9 compares the distribution of the XtX test statistic against the χ2 distribution for typed
and imputed variants at different frequencies. Figure S11 depicts -log10 PXtX for all imputed
variants with mean allele frequency in the range 2-98%.
