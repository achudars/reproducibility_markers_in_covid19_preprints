Next generation sequencing technologies have become increasingly used to describe microbial communities.
Metagenomics characterization of microbiomes is associated with minimal manipulation during sample
processing, which includes sampling, storage, DNA isolation, library preparation and sequencing, before the
raw data are obtained. Here we assess the effect of library preparation using a kit with a polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) step (Nextera) and two PCR-free kits (NEXTflex and KAPA), and the effect of sequencing
platform (HiSeq and NextSeq) on the description of microbial communities in pig feces and sewage. Two pig
fecal samples were obtained from different farms and two sewage samples were collected as inlet water at
a local wastewater treatment facility. Samples were processed to both perform DNA-isolation immediately
upon arrival in the lab and after storage for 64 hours at -80°C, DNA isolation was performed in duplicate.

We find that both library preparation and sequencing platform had systematic effects on the microbial
community description. The effects were at a level that made differentiating between the two pig fecal
samples difficult. The sewage samples represented two very different communities and were at all times
distinguishable from each other. We find that library preparation and sequencing platform introduced more
variation than freezing the samples. The community changes did not seem associated with contamination
during processing and distinct patterns connected specific types of organisms with a processing method, but
it was difficult to generalize between samples. This highlights the need for continuous validation of the effect
of sample processing in different types of samples and that all processing steps need to be considered when
comparing between studies. We believe standardization of sample processing is key to generate comparable
data within a study and that comparisons of differently generated data, e.g. in a meta-analysis, should be
performed cautiously.

Microbes are omnipresent and inhabit even the most extreme environments on earth. Metagenomics has
provided unprecedented detail into these microbial communities, but the application is extending beyond
environmental ecology. Metagenomics is applied heavily to human microbiomes and is being implemented
to understand disease state (1–4) for diagnostic purposes (5) and surveillance (6–9). Data are a growing
resource that can be utilized in meta-analysis and data-mining, revolutionizing the epidemiology of microbial
diseases (6,9–12).

Findings from research related to human health and disease can be difficult to replicate as observed in
different meta-analyses of 16S rRNA gene amplicon studies (13–16). Considering the large number of
features (functional or taxonomic) under investigation in metagenomics, it is not surprising that studies never
seem to lack significant results (17). Data dredging is a real concern in metagenomics, which brings to mind
the “replication crisis” that has been highlighted in the field of psychology (18,19). Due to the challenge of
replicating results, one must not over-emphasize the results from exploratory research and keep in mind
with the maturation of metagenomics, that there is a need to continually validate the robustness and ability
to replicate results. (20,21). With the improvement of reference databases and bioinformatics tools, the
validation is an ongoing process (22–25).

Technical variation due to sample processing is an important factor that researchers have to minimize to
make proper inferences in metagenomics studies. The effect of DNA isolation has been investigated in papers
emphasizing the importance of this parameter (26–28). The effect of library preparation and sequencing
platform has been investigated in metagenomics, primarily on human fecal samples. Library preparation
affects taxonomic and functional characterization of human fecal samples and in silico constructed mock
communities (21,29). However, in a study by Costea et al. (26), the effect of library preparation was lower
compared with DNA isolation and intra- and inter-sample variation in general. The possibility that the
sequencing platform could also have an effect on the characterization of microbiomes is highlighted in a
study utilizing both metagenomics and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (30).

The aim of the present study is to assess the effect of library preparation (KAPA PCR-free, NEXTflex PCR-free
and Nextera) and sequencing platform (Illumina HiSeq and NextSeq) on the metagenomics based description
of two different microbiomes that includes two different sewage and pig fecal samples. We show that library
preparation and sequencing infer systematic bias to the microbial characterization and that this effect is
important when comparing similar samples, highlighting the need for consistent sample processing and
demonstration of cautiousness when comparing data from different studies.

A subset of DNA samples was selected from an ongoing investigation of the effect of different aspects of
sample processing. The DNA samples were from two pig fecal samples (P1 and P2) and two sewage samples
(S1 and S2). The two pig fecal samples were collected on different occasions from different conventional pig
production farms near the laboratory. The pig fecal samples were collected immediately after observed
defecation, transferred to a cooling box and delivered to the laboratory for further processing within 3 hours.
The two sewage samples were collected at a local wastewater treatment facility on different occasions. The
sewage samples were 20 L inlet water, transported in cooling boxes and delivered for further processing
within 20 mins. The sewage samples were centrifuged immediately upon arrival in the laboratory. Each pig
fecal sample and sedimented sewage sample was processed in the same way by first homogenizing the
samples then performing DNA isolation immediately and after 64 hours of storage at -80°C. DNA isolation
was performed in duplicate with a modified QIAamp Fast DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen) protocol including an
initial bead beating step (MoBio garnet beads) (27) (S1 Fig). A negative DNA isolation (blank) control was
included at each time of DNA isolation. The concentration of DNA samples was measured with the Qubit
dsDNA High Sensitivity (HS) assay kit on a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) before storing the
DNA at -20 °C.

Pre-processing of raw reads included trimming (Phred quality score = 20) and removal of reads shorter than
50bp (BBduk2) (31). Mapping was performed with a Burrows-Wheeler aligner (BWA-mem) as implemented
in MGmapper (22). Mapping was performed in the default “best mode” to 11 databases, first filtering against
the human database then extracting the number of raw reads mapping to the genomes of bacteria, fungi,
archaea, viruses and Cryptosporidium. A read count correction was implemented to adjust large hit counts
to specific contigs as implemented in Hendriksen et al. (9). All counts in the count table were divided by two
to account for reads were mapping as proper pairs and then aggregating to genus level. The processed count
table, metadata and feature data are available as S2 (File) and the raw reads are deposited at the European
Nucleotide Archive (ENA) (Project acc.: PRJEB31650).

All statistical analyses adhered to the compositional data analysis framework and were performed in R
version 3.5.2 (32–34). Initial filtering of the count matrix was performed in all analyses, removing all genera
below an average count of 5. The estimation of zeroes was performed using simple multiplicative
replacement (35). Isometric log-ratio transformation (ILR) was used in: The principal component analysis
(PCA), heatmaps to perform complete-linkage clustering analysis of the samples, boxplots to calculate
pairwise Euclidean distance between samples and in multivariate analysis of variances testing which
parameters that significantly influence the multivariate outcome the most using permutation tests
(32,34,36,37). Centered log-ratio transformation (CLR) was used in: Sparse partial-least-squares discriminant
analysis (sPLS-DA) and constrained ordination with redundancy analysis (rda), where it was important to keep

The number of raw reads from the different library preparations and sequencing platforms were similar with
about a factor 2 difference when comparing the medians. The highest number of reads were obtained from
the NEXTflex HiSeq run (median: 12.1, range: 6.3 – 30.8 million reads) and the lowest from the NEXTflex
NextSeq run (median: 7.6, range: 2.7 – 9.4 million reads). The outputs from the KAPA HiSeq run (median: 9.4,
range: 7.8 – 17.4 million reads) and the Nextera NextSeq runs (median: 10.2, range: 6.5 – 16.5 million reads)
were about the same. More reads were obtained from the pig fecal samples compared with the sewage, but
a larger proportion of the sewage reads mapped to the reference databases. The microbial community of the
sewage samples exhibited a higher α-diversity (Simpson) than the pig feces (Table S1). However, the number
of mapped reads were higher for the sewage samples, and many of the samples had reached a plateau as
observed when creating a rarefaction curve (S2 Fig). Similar results were obtained when comparing percent
of unmapped reads across the different library preparation and sequencing platform runs (S1 Table).

The pairwise Euclidean distance was calculated between all of the samples and visualized using PCA (S3A Fig).
The sample type explained the most variance and pig feces and sewage samples were clearly separated on
the first axis. Separation of the two sewage samples was observed on the second axis. However, the two pig
fecal samples formed a single group. Ordination of the pig feces and sewage samples separately revealed
that the two pig fecal samples seemed to belong to two separate groups (S3B Fig), and a clear separation of
the two sewage samples was still observed (S3C Fig). Creating boxplots of the pairwise distances revealed
that both library preparation, sequencing platform and storage did not hamper the ability to differentiate
between the two sewage samples as observed in the PCA (Fig 1). However, a large degree of overlap was
observed between pig feces 1 and 2 comparisons relative to comparing within the two samples representing
the effect of the different sample processing parameters. In general, larger distances were calculated for the
comparisons of sample processing parameters in pig fecal samples compared with sewage. The shortest
distances were observed when comparing the DNA isolation replicates and the replicates of the Nextera
NextSeq runs. The distances between samples that only differed in library preparation and sequencing
platform were greater compared with samples that differed in whether they were processed directly or after
freezing at -80°C for 64 hours. The sequencing platform seemed to be the major contributor of variation
when comparing the samples that were prepared with NEXTflex and sequenced on the HiSeq and NextSeq
(Fig 1). To investigate the effect of sample processing further, PCAs were created for the individual samples
(P1, P2, S1 and S2). Similar patterns were observed in all samples indicating that there was a systematic effect
from storage, library preparation and sequencing platform. In general, the DNA isolation replicates were
similar as well as the two Nextera NextSeq runs (Fig 2). Investigating how large an effect the different
parameters had by partitioning sums of squares of the Euclidean distance matrix revealed that all of the

parameters had a significant effect when assessing uncorrected p-values except for storage when comparing
all of the samples and in pig feces 2. Comparing the percent variation in pig feces attributed to sample (P1
and P2) (21.1 %) library preparation (32.7 %) and sequencing platform (19.1 %) were at a similar level, further
emphasizing the importance of sample processing when comparing communities that are more similar in
general (Table 1).

To investigate the effect of library preparation and sequencing platform on specific organisms, an initial
overview was obtained for the 30 most abundant genera in heatmaps of pig feces and sewage separately. As
highlighted above, the importance of sequencing platform in differentiating pig feces was observed by being
the first branching of the samples (P1 and P2) in the dendogram (Fig 3A). Clustering was also observed for
the storage condition and library preparation. The pig feces contained both Gram–negative and –positive
bacteria, and the third cluster exclusively consisted of Gram–negatives. There were a few Gram–negatives in
the other clusters, indicating that sample processing shifts the abundance profiles for specific types of
organisms, in this case, it seemed associated with cell wall structure (Fig 3A). A similar pattern was observed
in sewage that mainly consisted of Gram–negatives, but the majority of Gram–positives were part of cluster
four including Clostridium, Faecalibacterium and Roseburia. However, this cluster also contained Gram–
negative genera (Figure 3B).

One explanation for the community differences observed by sample processing could be a possible
contamination during the library preparation and sequencing steps. To elucidate this, sPLS-DA was
performed, assessing which genera best characterize the library preparation and sequencing platform
processing methods. Component 1, 2 and 3 were included in the model containing 5, 50 and 20 different
genera, respectively (S4 Fig). The majority of microorganisms were the highly abundant organisms observed
across all of the sample processing methods. However, a few were clear indicators of contamination during
library preparation and sequencing and were mainly present in a single processing method. This included
Methylobacterium in the KAPA HiSeq run that has previously been associated with kit contamination and
Cutibacterium in the second Nextera NextSeq run, a typical bacterium inhabiting the skin (39). A heat map of
the 30 most abundant genera in the blank controls additionally revealed a high abundance of Ralstonia in
the Nextera NextSeq runs that where performed with the same kit reagents (S5 Fig). The separation of the
samples according to the different processing parameters therefore seemed to be real changes to the relative
abundances between organisms inherently present in the communities and not due to contamination. A
constrained ordination, also subsetted according to if samples were processed directly or after freezing, was
performed to assess if groups of organisms at a taxonomic higher level were associated with a specific library
preparation and sequencing method. In the pig feces, Proteobacteria seemed associated with the HiSeq runs.
However, this was not observed in sewage. In sewage, Archaea were associated with the HiSeq runs, but also
Eukaryotes consisting of Fungi and Cryptosporidium seemed associated with the HiSeq runs in sewage 1 (S6
Fig). Overall, it was difficult to observe a pattern when assessing this grouping of genera, highlighting that it
might be difficult to generalize the effect of sample processing in different sample types and different
samples of the same type.

With the increasing amount of metagenomics data in public repositories; meta-analysis and cross-study
analysis based on data from different studies are exciting new opportunities to gain further insight into the
microbial world (10–12,24,40). Data generation is usually not performed with a standard procedure across
studies, and sample processing is an important factor to be aware of when trying to make inferences in these
cross study investigations (21,26). In the present study, both library preparation and sequencing platform
had a significant effect on explaining the variance in the data (Table 1). That these parameters infer changes
to the community description has also been observed previously (21,29,30). In the study by Costea et al. (26),
DNA isolation had the largest effect compared with other technical variations. In the first phase of the study
by Costea et al. (26) samples were sent out for DNA isolation and sequenced centrally. In the present study,
DNA isolation was performed centrally by the same person and library preparation and sequencing in-house
or at external providers, but not in any of the cases by the same person, possibly increasing variation due to
DNA shipping and handling in this specific step. When performing a validation study assessing the technical
variation of sample processing, the large number of methodologies and variations thereof make it impossible

to test all parameters. It is likely that selecting methods that are based on different principles and for specific
purposes yield results that highlight the importance of this specific step. Bowers et al. (29) investigated
community changes using different amounts of input DNA, and observed that this modification had a
significant effect on community description. In the present study, investigation of sequencing platforms were
limited to the NextSeq and HiSeq, which are both Illumina platforms resembling each other in technology,
and which were selected due to their popularity in metagenomics with low cost relative to output (41).
Nonetheless, a very large effect was attributed to the sequencing platform and that was also observed when
using the same library preparation kit (NEXTflex PCR-Free) (Fig 1). The library preparation included two
methods that required pre-fragmented DNA that was prepared PCR-free (KAPA and NEXTflex). It was decided
to include the Illumina Nextera library preparation as well to compare with a technique that does not
resemble the others in having enzymatic fragmentation and which involved a PCR step that is commonly
applied when too little DNA is available to prepare DNA for sequencing PCR-free. However, the two Nextera
runs were relatively similar compared with the NEXTflex run when sequenced on the NextSeq (Fig 2). The
present study was not a full factorial experiment and this should be emphasized when comparing the effect
sizes of specific processing parameters.

One explanation for the differences observed between the processing runs can be contamination bias. When
designing a metagenomics study, it is to some extent possible to remove kit contaminations or carry-over
between sequencing runs from the data in-silico, if for instance, blank controls are included or by rotating
indexing primers between adjacent runs, respectively (42). In the present study, comparing the sPLS-DA
results with the blank controls rarely identified the same genera, indicating that the genera reported to
explain the specific sample processing the most were not due to contamination during DNA extraction. The
general variation associated with redoing the library preparation and sequencing was low when comparing
the two Nextera sequencing runs (Figs 1 and 2). The differences observed are therefore most likely true
technical variation associated with the sample processing. Furthermore, it was possible to detect that these
patterns were systematic in the different samples (Fig 2), and that this could partly be explained with some
crude features such as distinguishing between Gram-negative and -positive bacteria or at a higher taxonomic
classification (Fig 3 and S6 Fig). The grouping of genera were selected before analysis to be investigated, but
they might be confounders of the underlying explanation that could be associated with DNA characteristics
such as fuanine-cytosine percent (GC%) or other specific DNA patterns. Another possibility is that DNA
fragmentation during sampling, storage and DNA isolation provide DNA of different quality for specific
organism groups. A shift in community structure is then reflected in the selection of different fragment sizes
during the library preparation and sequencing.

The Euclidean distances obtained from comparing within the two pig fecal samples separately relative to the
two sewage samples also revealed that storage, library preparation and sequencing platform has a larger
effect in pig feces (Fig 1). Since, the distances between the two pig fecal samples were smaller relative to the
distances between the two sewage samples, it was difficult to discern the two pig fecal samples when
samples were processed differently (Fig 3). It is concerning that the variation due to sample processing
hampers the ability to differentiate between two different pig fecal samples, and this might hamper the
ability to draw meaningful conclusions when technical variations cannot be distinguished from “true”
changes. These results should on the other hand not be overstated; the two pig fecal samples were obtained
from an in-bred race raised under very similar conditions including feeding, even though they were obtained
from two different healthy pigs at two different farms, the two communities are relatively similar. The finding

highlights that the importance of technical variation depends on the differences that one is trying to detect
(16). If sewage samples were the only sample matrix investigated, the technical variation did not hamper the
ability to differentiate between the two sewage samples. These findings suggest that library preparation and
sequencing are important parameters to keep constant when a study is trying to detect small changes in
community structure.

at -80°C for 64 hours. The DNA isolation were performed in duplicates. Library preparation and sequencing
was performed in four different combinations: KAPA PCR-free on the HiSeq, NEXTflex PCR free both on the
HiSeq and NextSeq, and the Nextera protocol were run twice on the NextSeq. The setup resulted in a total
of 80 metagenomes plus five negative controls.
