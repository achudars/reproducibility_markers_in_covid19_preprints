Abstract

25

Kinesin motors provide the molecular forces at the kinetochore-microtubule interface and

26

along the spindle to control chromosome segregation. During meiosis with the two rounds of

27

microtubule assembly-disassembly, the roles of motor proteins remain unexplored. We

28

observed that in contrast to mitosis Cin8 (kinesin 5) and Kip3 (kinesin 8) together are

29

indispensable in meiosis. Examining the meiosis in cin8∆ kip3∆ cells, we detected

chromosome breakage in the meiosis II cells. The double mutant exhibits delay in the cohesin

2

removal and spindle elongation during anaphase I. Consequently, some cells abrogate

3

meiosis II and form dyads while some, as they progress through meiosis II, cause defect in

4

chromosome integrity. We believe that in the latter cells, an imbalance of spindle mediated

5

force and simultaneous persistent cohesin on the chromosomes cause their breakage. We

6

provide evidence that tension generated by Cin8 and Kip3 through microtubule cross-linking

7

is essential for signaling efficient cohesin removal and maintenance of chromosome integrity

during meiosis.

Introduction

10

Meiotic chromosome segregation comprises of certain unique events unlike in

11

mitosis. In budding yeast these events include late assembly of the mature kinetochore

12

competent to connect the microtubules; pairing of the homologs; mono-orientation of the

13

sister kinetochores with respect to the spindle pole in metaphase I; a step wise dissolution of

14

cohesin from the chromatin; two rounds of chromosome segregation with spindle assembly

15

and dis-assembly and a partial dephosphorylation of the CDK substrates adequate for spindle

16

disassembly at meiosis I but not for DNA replication. Further, while dephosphorylation of the

17

CDK substrates by Cdc14 phosphatase is essential for cell cycle exit both in mitosis and

18

meiosis, FEAR-released Cdc14 appears to be dispensable for the same in mitosis but not in

19

meiosis as it is required to exit from meiosis I (Buonomo et al., 2003; Marston et al., 2003;

20

Yellman and Roeder, 2015). Nevertheless, FEAR-released Cdc14 has significant roles both in

21

mitosis and meiosis for coherent segregation of all the chromosomal loci, and for the stability

22

and proper orientation of the microtubule spindle (D'Amours and Amon, 2004; Khmelinskii

23

and Schiebel, 2008; Lee and Amon, 2003; Marston et al., 2003; Roccuzzo et al., 2015).

24

Irrespective of the type of cell cycle, the formation of a microtubule-based

25

spindle and movement of the chromosomes along the spindle being attached to the

26

microtubule play a pivotal role during chromosome segregation. The occurrence of these

27

events relies on the polymerization-depolymerization property of the microtubules which is

28

facilitated by the functions of several microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) and

29

microtubule based motors (Barton and Goldstein, 1996). In S. cerevisiae four nuclear motors

30

of kinesin superfamily (Kinesin-related Proteins, KRPs) namely Cin8, Kip1, Kip3 and Kar3,

31

have essential roles in chromosome segregation (Gupta Jr et al., 2006; Roof et al., 1992;

32

Saunders and Hoyt, 1992; Saunders et al., 1995; Tytell and Sorger, 2006). However, due to

functional redundancy among these motors, they are non-essential for growth (Cottingham et

2

al., 1999; DeZwaan et al., 1997).

3

Cin8 and Kip1 belong to BimC or kinesin-5 family of proteins, where the motor

4

domain is at the amino terminal end of the protein and the motor movement is directed

5

towards the plus end of the microtubule (Dagenbach and Endow, 2004; Hoyt et al., 1992a).

6

Cin8 and Kip1 form homo-tetramers and their plus-end directed functions are to extend the

7

spindle by pushing the poles apart and to maintain the kinetochores in the clustered form

8

through cross-linking of antiparallel and parallel microtubules, respectively (Gordon and

9

Roof, 1999; Hildebrandt et al., 2006; Kashlna et al., 1996; Mayr et al., 2011; Rizk et al.,

10

2014). Later, through in vitro assays, minus-end directed movement of both of these single

11

motors have been identified when they work singly on individual microtubule (Fridman et al.,

12

2013; Gerson‐Gurwitz et al., 2011; Roostalu et al., 2011; Shapira and Gheber, 2016).

13

Recently, it has shown under in vivo condition that Cin8 clusters at the minus end and SPB

14

during the early stage of mitosis for capturing the microtubules emanating from opposite

15

SPBs that facilitates bi-polar spindle formation (Shapira et al., 2017). However, the

16

implication of Kip1 minus end directed movement has not been explored. In addition to the

17

cross-linking function, Cin8 and to a lesser extent Kip1 can also depolymerize kMT

18

(kinetochore microtubule) in a length dependent manner which is believed to be essential for

19

congression of the chromosomes (Gardner et al., 2008). The regulation of Cin8 and Kip1

20

functions depends on the phosphorylation status of these proteins where their

21

phosphorylation by Cdk1 during early mitosis mediates the SPB separation (Chee and Haase,

22

2010). In metaphase, Cin8 and Kip1 are localized at the centromeres and along the

23

microtubule length (Tytell and Sorger, 2006). Since phosphorylation of Cin8 inhibits its

24

association to the microtubules (Goldstein et al., 2017), following metaphase to anaphase

25

transition dephosphorylation of Cin8 by PP2ACdc55 and Cdc14 results in its accumulation near

26

the spindle poles and at the spindle midzone which is crucial for spindle elongation (Avunie-

27

Masala et al., 2011; Goldstein et al., 2018). However, it is not known if similar

28

dephosphorylation also occurs in Kip1. During early anaphase, APCCdc20 degrades Kip1

29

(Gordon and Roof, 2001) whereas Cin8 is degraded during late anaphase by APC Cdh1

30

(Hildebrandt and Hoyt, 2001). On the other hand the primary function of Kip3 motor,

31

belonging to either kinesin-8 or -13 family of proteins, is the depolymerization of

32

microtubules plus ends by a mechanism similar to kinesin-13 motors (Friel and Howard,

33

2011; Gupta Jr et al., 2006; Gupta et al., 2006; Hunter et al., 2003). This function of Kip3

driven by its neck domain with depolymerase activity (Su et al., 2013a) has a role in the

2

movement of chromosomes during anaphase (Tang and Toda, 2015; Tytell and Sorger,

3

2006). However, Kip3 also slides and clusters the microtubules by cross-linking antiparallel

4

and parallel microtubules, respectively through its tail domain (Su et al., 2011a). Although,

5

the cross-linking function of Kip3 is trivial as compared to kinesin-5 proteins owing to it's

6

intrinsic structural ability to form homo-dimer but not homotetramer observed in kinesin-5

7

motors (Gordon and Roof, 1999; Hildebrandt et al., 2006; Kashlna et al., 1996; Mayr et al.,

8

2011; Rizk et al., 2014). Kip3 activity appears to be regulated spatially and temporally based

9

on the length of the spindle and the exact localization of the motor. On a short spindle, it

10

helps in clustering and alignment of the kinetochores by cross-linking of the parallel

11

microtubules and depolymerase activity at the plus ends. During increase in the spindle

12

length Kip3 cross-links and slides the anti-parallel interpolar microtubules. Finally when the

13

spindle reaches to its maximum length, Kip3 localize at the plus-ends and by its

14

depolymerization activity causes spindle disassembly (Rizk et al., 2014; Su et al., 2013a).

15

Kar3 (a minus end-directed kinesin-14 family of protein) is a second microtubule

16

depolymerizer present in the cell and is functionally antagonistic to Cin8/Kip1 spindle

17

elongation activity. Kar3 pulls two spindle poles together, therefore the spindle collapse

18

observed in the absence of both Cin8 and Kip1 can be suppressed by reducing the activity of

19

Kar3 (Hoyt et al., 1993). Additionally, Kar3 appears to promote kinetochore-microtubule

20

attachment as in mitosis it is found to occupy a subset of kinetochores on which microtubule

21

attachments are slow to form (Tytell and Sorger, 2006).

22

Several groups as described above have elucidated the functions of the nuclear kinesin

23

motors in chromosome segregation in mitosis. Given the mechanistic uniqueness in

24

chromosome segregation in meiosis as outlined above, it is intriguing to investigate their

25

functions during this cell cycle. However, KAR3 mutant was found to be arrested at prophase

26

I (Bascom-Slack and Dawson, 1997; Shanks et al., 2001) and hence makes it difficult to

27

analyze the meiotic events in lack of Kar3. Therefore, in this study, we focused on

28

elucidating the functions of the three motors, Cin8, Kip1 and Kip3 in meiosis. Using

29

knockout mutants, we observed that these motors are required for homolog pairing.

30

Strikingly, we noticed cells with loss of both Cin8 and Kip3 harbor chromosome breakage.

31

Further investigation argues for a defect in Rec8-cohesin removal from the chromatin in these

32

cells. We propose that the conditions in the absence of Cin8 and Kip3 perhaps create an

33

imbalance between the microtubule mediated force and the resisting force by the persistent

1

cohesin, which may lead to the chromosome breakage. From our findings, we suggest that the

2

tension generated by the cross-linking activity of Cin8 and Kip3 is crucial to signal the cells

3

for the cohesin cleavage. Thus, our study reveals significant roles of kinesin motors in

4

meiosis and hints towards essentiality of these proteins in suppressing aneuploidy during

5

gametogenesis.

Results

7

The motors are required for faithful meiosis

8

As the first set of experiments, we compared the spore viability, a readout for faithful

9

meiosis, between the wild-type and the individual motor mutants. Given that there are

10

functional redundancies among the motors, we observed a marginal decrease in spore

11

viability in kip1 and kip3 (approximately 89 and 92%, respectively). However, cin8∆

12

showed around 65% reduction in spore viability suggesting this protein is more significant in

13

meiosis (Fig. 1A). It is expected that the pace of meiotic progression can be slowed down if

14

there is any perturbation in meiosis. To test this wild-type and the mutant strains were

15

released into synchronized meiosis. Consistent with the spore viability data we observed that

16

cin8∆ showed a delay at metaphase I compared to the wild-type, kip1∆ and kip3∆ mutants

17

(Fig. 1B, ii) suggesting some defect is occurring during early meiotic events in the absence of

18

Cin8 and perhaps due to functional redundancy the defect is not apparent in kip1∆ and kip3∆

19

mutants. To investigate if the defect causes chromosomes to mis-segregate we marked both

20

the CenV homologs with TetO/TetR-GFP system (see materials and methods) and observed

21

their distribution at the end of meiosis. Following faithful meiosis, a tetra-nucleate would

22

show one GFP dot at each nucleus (Fig. 1D; Type I). However, four GFP dots in three, two

23

nuclei (Type II and III) or in one nucleus accounts for chromosome mis-segregation. The

24

meiotic induction, unless otherwise mentioned, was carried out at 33°C, as the phenotype of

25

loss of Cin8 becomes aggravated at a higher temperature (Hildebrandt and Hoyt, 2000;

26

Saunders et al., 1997; Tytell and Sorger, 2006). We observed around 50, 22 and 17% (Type II

27

and Type III) of chromosome mis-segregation in cin8∆, kip1∆ and kip3∆ cells, respectively

28

(Fig. 1D) suggesting spore viability defect is probably due to the generation of aneuploids. As

29

in cin8∆, the delay in the cell cycle occurs in metaphase I, we presumed that at least some

30

defects might be occurring during the preceding events of chromosome segregation that

31

include chromatid cohesion, homolog pairing and sister chromatid mono-orientation. To

32

investigate the cohesion between the sisters and the orientation of their spindle attachment,

33

both the sisters of one homolog were marked with TetO/TetR-GFP system. In the metaphase

I arrested cells, a defect in sister chromatid mono-orientation would appear as two GFP dots.

2

On the other hand, non-cohesed sisters in the cycling cells would produce bi-nucleates with

3

one GFP dot in each of the nucleus. However, we failed to detect any defect either in sister

4

chromatid monoorientation or in their cohesion (Fig. S1A-B). Although not for Cin8, Kip1

5

or Kip3, a role of Kar3 in sister chromatid cohesion in mitosis has been reported before

6

(Mayer et al., 2004).

7

However, we observed an increased defect in homolog pairing in cin8∆ when both the

8

CenV homologs were marked with GFP (Fig. 1E; Type II and Type III). Consistent with this

9

we observed a higher percentage of mis-localization (polycomplex formation) of Zip1, a

10

component of the synaptonemal complex (SC) that reinforces pairing (Fig. 1F). A similar

11

result was also obtained before where homologs fail to synapse in the absence of Kar3

12

(Bascom-Slack and Dawson, 1997). Following dis-assembly of SC, Zip1 is maintained at the

13

centromeres until the proper bipolar attachment of the homologs is achieved (Gladstone et al.,

14

2009). As the Zip1 localization was compromised in cin8∆ or kip1∆ mutant, we examined the

15

homolog biorientation in the motor mutants where both the CenV homologs were marked

16

with GFP. About 37% of the bi-nucleated cells in cin8∆ showed homolog non-disjunction

17

compared to only 7% in the wild-type (Fig. 1G; Type II).While in kip3∆ and kip1∆, the

18

population exhibiting such defect was relatively less (14% and 11%, respectively, Fig.1G).

19

Similar results were observed in zip1∆ mad2∆ double mutant where about 45% of cells

20

showed homolog non-disjunction (Gladstone et al., 2009) which is comparable to the

21

population obtained in cin8∆ in our study. Above results suggest that the absence of the

22

motor proteins, specially Cin8, can affect homolog pairing in meiosis.

10

disjunction and non-disjunction of the homologs, respectively. Error bars represent the standard deviation from

11

the mean values obtained from at three independent experiments. Bar, 2 µm.

12

Meiosis is profoundly compromised in cin8∆ kip3∆ double mutant

13

Since Cin8, Kip1 and Kip3 share overlapping functions in microtubule cross-linking

14

and depolymerization (Gardner et al., 2008; Gupta et al., 2006; Hoyt et al., 1992a; Saunders

15

and Hoyt, 1992; Su et al., 2013a; Tytell and Sorger, 2006; Winey and Bloom, 2012), we

16

argued that their functions cannot be properly revealed studying only the single mutants.

17

Therefore, we generated two possible viable double mutants kip1∆ kip3∆, and cin8∆ kip3∆ as

18

cin8∆ kip1∆ has been reported as inviable (Gordon and Roof, 1999; Hoyt et al., 1992a;

19

Kapitein et al., 2005; Roof et al., 1992). Albeit, the sporulation efficiencies of cin8∆, kip3∆

20

and cin8∆ kip3∆ strains were similar (63%, 85% and 70%, respectively; Fig 2A) after 12 h of

21

sporulation induction, strikingly we observed a precipitous drop (approximately 16%) in

22

spore viability of the double mutant compared to cin8∆ and kip3∆ single mutants (Fig. 1A).

23

To further investigate the probable roles of Cin8 and Kip3 together in meiosis, we followed

24

meiotic progression in the wild-type and motor mutants and noticed that in comparison to the

25

wild-type or cin8∆ or kip3∆, cin8∆ kip3∆ double mutant proceeded through meiosis more

26

slowly and the majority of the cells were arrested transiently at anaphase I with one spindle

27

and improper disjunction of nuclei (Fig.1B, iii- C).

28

Given that Cin8 and Kip3 can cross-link and slide the antiparallel microtubules

29

causing spindle elongation, our results indicate that the cells lacking both Cin8 and Kip3

30

cause slow spindle elongation and defects in chromosome disjunction during meiosis I that

31

might be responsible for a delay in spindle disassembly and completion of meiosis I.

32

Furthermore, due to this delay around 50% of the cin8∆ kip3∆ cells biochemically proceeded

33

to meiosis II without completing meiosis I and produced dyads (Fig. 2B). Inability to

34

complete meiosis I due to defect in spindle elongation but proceeding to meiosis II and

generation of the dyads with two diploid spores are the hallmarks of the FEAR mutants

2

(Buonomo et al., 2003; Kamieniecki et al., 2000; Marston et al., 2003; Zeng and Saunders,

3

2000). Additionally, similar to the FEAR mutants (Marston et al., 2003), in cin8∆ kip3∆ cells,

4

we mostly observed reductional segregation of chromosomes in the dyads as both the

5

heterozygously tagged CenV-GFP dots (sister chromatids) were found in one spore in 76% of

6

the dyads (Fig. 2C). However, co-segregation of the sister chromatids per se does not imply

7

the abrogation of meiosis II in cin8∆ kip3∆ cells since in many dyads we observed stained

8

nuclei that were not included into the spores suggesting massive mis-segregation has

9

occurred during meiosis II as well. Consequently, the viability of the dyad spores obtained

10

from cin8∆ kip3∆ cells was extremely poor (10%; Fig. 2D).

16

The supernumerary CenV-GFP foci were observed in only those cin8∆ kip3∆ cells (SGY5385) that are in

17

meiosis II as judged by the presence of two spindles (marked by arrows). Error bars represent the standard

18

deviation from the mean values obtained from three independent experiments.

19

We believe that the phenotypes of cin8∆ kip3∆ cells are similar to the FEAR mutants

20

as the FEAR-released Cdc14 phosphatase promotes spindle elongation through

21

dephosphorylation of Cin8 that facilitates its binding to the spindles and sliding of the anti-

22

parallel microtubules (Avunie-Masala et al., 2011; Roccuzzo et al., 2015). However, removal

23

of Cin8 alone did not exhibit as severe phenotype as the FEAR mutants due to functional

24

redundancy in spindle elongation between Cin8 and Kip1/Kip3 and due to additional

25

functions of the FEAR network (Rock and Amon, 2009). It is also expected that the FEAR

26

mutant-like phenotypes observed in meiotic cin8∆ kip3∆ cells will also be observed in

27

mitosis. Since the FEAR mutants exhibit a delay in mitotic exit (Stegmeier et al., 2002), the

28

wild-type and the motor mutants were released synchronously using α-factor into fresh YPD

29

media to compare the pace of mitosis. As observed for the FEAR mutant esp1-1 (Queralt et

30

al., 2006; Stegmeier et al., 2002), we observed a delay in cell-cycle progression in cin8∆ and

31

cin8∆ kip3∆ cells. Wild-type, kip1∆, and kip3∆ completed one cycle of mitosis in

32

approximately 55 min while in cin8∆ and cin8∆ kip3∆ it was delayed (around 75 min) as

33

shown by dotted and dashed line, respectively in figure S2A. In the time window between 90

34

to 100 min (Fig. S2B), the wild-type, kip1∆, and kip3∆ exhibit the second peak for the

35

metaphase cells, while cin8∆ demonstrates only one peak whereas in cin8∆ kip3∆ the same

36

peak is broadened and further extended till 105 min suggesting that metaphase to anaphase

1

transition is maximally delayed in the double mutant. Additionally, we also observed a

2

phenotype in cin8∆ and cin8∆ kip3∆ mutants at an equal frequency where co-ordination

3

between spindle elongation and the chromosome segregation was compromised. In these cells

4

we found a persistent population of cells with elongated nucleus spanning mother and

5

daughter buds but with a bipolar spindle in one of the buds with a length specific to that of

6

the metaphase (Fig. S2C; Type II). Such a phenotype could be due to inability to extend the

7

spindle but with continuous to and fro movement of the short spindle resulting nuclear

8

elongation which has been observed before with metaphase arrested short spindle (Tanaka et

9

al., 2007)

10

From the above results, it is apparent that absence of both Cin8 and Kip3 causes

11

defects in spindle elongation, metaphase to anaphase transition and spindle disassembly both

12

in mitosis and meiosis. However, in contrast to poor spore viability following meiosis

13

observed in the cin8∆ kip3∆ (Fig. 1A), we failed to get any difference in viability among the

14

wild-type, single mutants and cin8∆ kip3∆ double mutant following mitosis (Fig. S2D). This

15

is further supported by the fact that while the pace of meiosis was found to be affected to a

16

large extent in the cin8∆ kip3∆ double mutant with respect to the wild-type or the single

17

mutants (Fig.1B), the mitotic growth rates were not affected to that extent (Fig. S2E). These

18

results suggest that loss of both Cin8 and Kip3 perhaps cause some meiosis specific defects

19

as revealed below.

20

Meiotic chromosome segregation is largely perturbed in cin8∆ kip3∆

21

To examine if there are any meiotic-specific defects in cin8∆ kip3∆ double mutant we

22

sought out to investigate the meiotic chromosome segregation under this condition. We used

23

wild-type,and cin8∆ kip3∆, kip1∆ kip3∆ double mutants and the corresponding single

24

mutants cells where both the homologs of chromosome V were marked with CenV-GFP.

25

Since we observed that cin8∆ kip3∆ double mutant did not sporulate at increased 33° C

26

temperature, meiosis induction was carried out at 30°C.We analyzed the tetra-nulceated cells

27

to ensure both meiosis I and II have occurred. Wild-type, kip3∆, kip1∆, and kip1∆ kip3∆ cells

28

showed mostly (100%, 92%, 84%, and 88%, respectively) four nuclei with one GFP dot in

29

each (Fig. 2E; Type I) which was reduced in cin8∆ and largely in cin8∆ kip3∆ cells (79% and

30

44%, respectively). Type II and III categories having GFP dots in three or in two nuclei,

31

respectively and accounting for mis-segregation of the chromosomes were found

32

correspondingly more in the mutants. Unexpectedly, a significant population of tetra-

33

nucleates (approximately 30%) harboring >4 (termed ‘supernumerary’) CenV-GFP dots were

1

found in cin8∆ kip3∆ cells (Fig. 2E; type IV category) while a minute population of this

2

category was observed in kip1∆ kip3∆ cells (6%). The difference observed between the

3

double mutants can be expected since Cin8 is known to have more significant cell cycle

4

functions than Kip1 from the mitotic study (Hoyt et al., 1992b). The supernumerary GFP dots

5

phenotype is not specific to chromosome V since the same phenotype was also observed

6

(approximately 35%; Type IV) in the cin8∆ kip3∆ double mutant when chromosome III was

7

marked using LacO/LacI-GFP system at the pericentromeric region (22 kb away from CenIII;

8

Fig. 2F). To determine the stage of the cell cycle at which these supernumerary foci start

9

appearing, Tub1 was N-terminally tagged with CFP in the cin8∆ kip3∆ strain harboring

10

homologous CenV-GFP. Chromosome abnormality was found only in the cells with two

11

spindles suggesting >4 foci were generated in the cells that have passed through meiosis II

12

(Fig. 2G). This numerical abnormality is specific to meiosis and did not occur due to any

13

aneuploidy generated as a legacy of an error during previous mitosis since we failed to obtain

14

>2 GFP dots before entering into meiosis (Fig. S3A) or during any stage of mitosis (Fig.

15

S3B) in the cin8∆ kip3∆ cells.

16

Chromosome breakage occurs in cin8∆ kip3∆ during meiosis II

17

We next sought to address the reason for generation of supernumerary GFP foci in

18

cin8∆ kip3∆ cells. At least two possibilities can be envisaged for this. Firstly, a leaky

19

chromosome replication between meiosis I and II may amplify the operator arrays and cause

20

>4 foci. However, this possibility seems unlikely because if there is a leaky replication of the

21

operator array, due to close proximity (within 1.4 kb), the CenV would have been also

22

replicated and in that case >4 kinetochore foci would have been observed which we failed to

23

detect at any stage of meiosis (Fig. S3C). Secondly, due to an imbalance of spindle force

24

acting on the centromeres, the chromosomes may break and since the operator arrays in our

25

assays remain closed to the centromere or pericentromere, the arrays can also break to give

26

>4 number of arrays and hence foci. Given the functions of the motors in moderating spindle-

27

chromosome interaction through force generation, the latter possibility is more likely. To

28

investigate if there is indeed any chromosome breakage, a single cell gel electrophoresis

29

assay, known as comet assay, was performed (Ostling and Johanson, 1984). As it is difficult

30

to lyse the tetrad because of the robust spore wall, cells were analyzed for the chromosome

31

breakage at the tetra-nucleated stage before the formation of the spore wall. H2O2 (10mM)

32

treated cells were used as a positive control for the breakage (Miloshev et al., 2002).

33

Interestingly, we got a notable population of DNA masses that formed tails or comet

1

phenotype in cin8∆ kip3∆ (approximately 20%) cells as compared to the wild-type (2.5%) or

2

cin8∆ (1%) cells while in H2O2 treated sample, almost 46% of the cells exhibited the comet

3

phenotype (Fig. 3A). These results suggest that the chromosome breakage does occur in

4

cin8∆ kip3∆ cells.

5

To further reconfirm the chromosome breakage, we looked at the localization pattern

6

of Rad52 which is required for the repair of DNA double-stranded break (DSB) generated

7

due to intrinsic or extrinsic factors (Barlow and Rothstein, 2009; Malone and Esposito, 1980;

8

Orr-Weaver et al., 1981; Resnick and Martin, 1976). In meiosis, at prophase I, programmed

9

DSBs occur for recombination and consequently Rad52 foci are visible at that stage in the

10

wild-type. However, once the DSBs are repaired the average number of Rad52 foci reduces

11

during later stages of meiosis (Gasior et al., 1998). We counted and compared the Rad52-

12

EGFP foci in the wild-type, cin8∆ and cin8∆ kip3∆ chromosome spreads harboring 1 SPB

13

within a single nucleus (prophase I stage, Fig. 3B), 2 SPBs, one in each of the 2 nuclei

14

(anaphase I stage, Fig. 3C) and 4 SPBs, one in each of the 4 nuclei (anaphase II/post meiosis

15

II stage, Fig. 3D). At prophase I, we observed an average 29 foci in the wild type which was

16

reduced to 9 ± 3in cin8∆ spreads (Fig. 3B) which is consistent to the defective homolog

17

pairing observed in cin8∆ (Fig. 1E). However, in cin8∆ kip3∆, the average count was nearly

18

21 which suggests that the loss of Kip3 by unknown mechanism rescues the defect of cin8∆.

19

While analyzing the spreads at anaphase I, we noticed no significant difference in Rad52-

20

EGFP staining between the wild-type and cin8∆ (wild-type 11±7; cin8∆ 10±4; Fig. 3C), but

21

observed a slight increase in the staining in the double mutant (cin8∆ kip3∆ 15±7; Fig. 3C).

22

However, a drastic accretion in Rad52-EGFP staining was observed in cin8∆ kip3∆ spreads at

23

anaphase II/post meiosis II (tetra-nucleated stage) over the wild-type or the cin8∆ (wild-type

24

13±6, cin8∆ 11±6, cin8∆ kip3∆ 24±6; Fig. 3D). These results indicate that as the cin8∆ kip3∆

25

cells pass through meiosis II, they accumulate DNA damage in the form of DSBs and perhaps

26

due to this the supernumerary CenV-GFP foci were observed only on meiosis II but not on

27

meiosis I spindle (Fig. 2G).

28

Earlier we noticed supernumerary SPB formation in the kinetochore mutants as the

29

cells enter into meiosis II (Agarwal et al., 2015). As both Cin8 and Kip3 also have some

30

functional roles at the centromere, we reasoned that in cin8∆ kip3∆ cells, following

31

interphase II (stage between meiosis I and II), may be >4 SPBs or spindle poles are generated

32

and the resulting extra pole(s) may cause imbalance of force and hence chromosome

33

breakage. However, analysis of the tetra-nulceated cin8∆ kip3∆ cells harboring >4 CenV13

GFP foci showed only 4 SPBs (Fig. S3D) indicating at least multipolarity is not the cause of

cin8∆ kip3∆ hinders the cohesin removal from the chromatin in meiosis

8

In budding yeast cohesin is removed from the chromosome arms during anaphase I

9

while the removal of the centromeric cohesin occurs during meiosis II. However, in the

10

FEAR mutants the loss of cohesin from the arms delays as the meiotic cohesin protein, Rec8

11

was detected at the arm regions during anaphase I (Marston et al., 2003). Since we noticed

12

cin8∆ kip3∆ exhibits the phenotypes similar to the FEAR mutants during meiosis (Fig. 1B, iii

13

and 2B), we therefore, investigated if the double mutant is compromised in cohesin removal.

14

We monitored the Rec8-EGFP staining at different stages of meiosis in the wild-type and

15

cin8∆ kip3∆ cells. Meiotic stages were determined on the basis of number and distance

16

between the Spc42 foci. The centromeric Rec8 was judged by its staining present only at the

17

vicinity of the SPBs due to proximity of the centromeres to the SPBs whereas arm plus

18

centromeric Rec8, termed as nuclear Rec8, was identified by its presence spanning a broader

19

region between the two SPBs (Fig. 4A-B). We observed that in the wild-type, 64% of the

20

anaphase I cells displayed centromeric Rec8 which was reduced to 35% in cin8∆ kip3∆ (Fig.

21

4C). However, we noticed more cells with nuclear Rec8 in the double mutant (65%) than the

22

wild-type (36%) suggesting a defect is cohesin removal during metaphase I to anaphase I

23

transition. Given cohesin removal completes during meiosis II, strikingly, nuclear Rec8 was

24

observed even during meiosis II stage at a staggering population (45%) in cin8∆ kip3∆

25

whereas in the wild-type such population was insignificant (3%; Fig. 4A, B, and D). We

26

obtained similar results in chromosome spreads immunostained for Rec8-EGFP where both

27

the bi-nucleated and the tetra-nucleated spreads had high levels of nuclear Rec8 (82% and

28

54%, respectively) in cin8∆ kip3∆ with respect to the wild-type (19% and 11%, respectively;

29

Fig. 4E-F). Notably, we observed that in cin8∆ also nuclear Rec8 persisted in a higher

30

population of bi-nucleated spreads (70%; Fig. 4E). However, in majority of the spreads at the

31

tetra-nucleated stage Rec8 appeared as a single dot indicating presence of negligible amount

32

on the chromatin; in contrast a dispersed Rec8 signal all over the chromatin was observed in

33

the double mutant in higher percentage of the spreads (Fig. 4F). These results altogether

34

suggest that a prolonged cohesin-chromatin association throughout meiosis occurs in cin8∆,

1

albeit at a lesser extent, and in cin8∆ kip3∆ cells. Due to this defect and the associated delay

2

in spindle elongation and disassembly, cin8∆ and cin8∆ kip3∆ cells show a delay in meiosis I

3

to meiosis II transition (Fig. 1B, iii). It is tempting to speculate that due to higher level of

4

retention of cohesin in the cin8∆ kip3∆ cells, during anaphase I and anaphase II spindle

5

elongations, the chromosomes cannot disjoin properly when subjected to pulling force

6

exerted by the other motors and they eventually break causing very low spore viability.

7

As we observed a delay in spindle elongation and cell cycle progression in cin8∆ and

8

cin8∆ kip3∆ cells, it is critical to address if the prolonged retention of Rec8 on the chromatin

9

is due to a delay in degradation of securin (Pds1), a condition that releases separase to cleave

10

Rec8. Under unperturbed condition Pds1 is degraded during metaphase I to anaphase I

11

transition following re-appearance in metaphase II and degradation in anaphase II. We

12

followed the level of Rec8 and Pds1 through synchronized meiosis in the wild-type, cin8∆,

13

and cin8∆ kip3∆ cells through immunoblotting (Fig. 5A-B). As observed earlier (Fig. 1B)

14

pace of meiosis was delayed in cin8∆ kip3∆ than the wild-type and cin8∆ (Fig. 5C), Pds1

15

degradation in the same strains also followed the same regime (Fig.5A-B). Notably, with

16

disappearance of Pds1 all Rec8 was removed in the wild-type while the removal was deferred

17

in cin8∆ and to a greater extent in cin8∆ kip3∆ (Fig. 5A-B). Consistent with our cell

18

biological data (Fig. 4), we noticed that in the double mutant a significant Rec8 level was

19

persistent even at 15 h in meiosis when around 90% of the cells had either entered into

20

anaphase II or sporulated whereas in such cells either in the wild-type or in the cin8∆ cells,

21

Rec8 was absent (Fig. 5A-C). Live cell imaging of Pds1-EGFP also revealed that there is no

22

difference in Pds1 stability on anaphase I spindle between the wild-type and the double

23

mutant (Fig. 5D). These results suggest that the protracted Rec8 retention on the chromatin in

24

the cin8∆ kip3∆cells is not due to a biochemical delay imposed by persistent Pds1.

16

If the defect in cohesin removal in cin8∆ kip3∆ cells is responsible for chromosome

17

mis-segregation, dyad formation and poor spore viability, the removal of Spo13, a meiosis

18

specific protein that has a role in the centromeric cohesin protection during meiosis I (Shonn

19

et al., 2002), in cin8∆ kip3∆ may improve the spore viability. Remarkably, the viability of the

20

dyads was improved from 7% in cin8∆ kip3∆ to approximately 43% in cin8∆ kip3∆ spo13∆

21

(Fig. 2D). These data along with the cell biological and immunoblotting observations suggest

22

that there is prolonged retention of Rec8 on the chromatin in the mutants and it is not due to

23

cell cycle delay or delay in Pds1 degradation instead our results as described below indicate

24

that perhaps some other factors also determine the fate of cohesin removal.

25

The failure in proper cohesin removal in post anaphase I cin8∆ kip3∆ cells instigated

26

us to examine if the similar defect prevails in mitosis. For estimation of Mcd1 (mitotic

27

cohesin) localization with respect to the distinct mitotic stages cells were released

28

synchronously from G1 arrest and were examined for the presence or absence of Mcd1-GFP

29

nuclear signal. With reference to the distances between the SPBs, we found no significant

30

difference in the Mcd1-EGFP staining between the wild-type and cin8∆ kip3∆. The cells with

31

the inter-polar distances in the range of 1.2 – 2.2 µm (metaphase/preanaphase) were positive

32

for Mcd1-GFP while beyond that (post-anaphase) no Mcd1 staining was visible (Fig. 5E).

33

These results indicate that mitotic cohesin removal is not perturbed in cin8∆ kip3∆ cells.

respectively. Error bars represent the standard deviation from the mean values obtained from three independent

Inhibition of recombination alleviates the anaphase I delay in cin8∆ kip3∆

6

The hindrance imposed by the reciprocal exchange (recombination) between the

7

homologs restricting their disjunction is relieved by the dissolution of cohesin from the arm

8

regions (Buonomo et al., 2000). Since, we observed a defect in cohesin removal and

9

subsequent delay in anaphase I in the double mutant; removal of Spo11, the enzyme required

10

for the double-stranded break formation to initiate recombination, in these cells should rescue

11

the delay. We observed that the removal of Spo11 in the cin8∆ kip3∆ double mutant indeed

12

caused the triple mutant to complete meiosis faster than the double mutant (Fig. S4A). For

13

instance, at 5 h time point the percentage of anaphase I cells was reduced to approximately

14

4% in the triple mutant which was found 20% in the cin8∆ kip3∆ (Fig. S4A) suggesting a

15

delay in the latter cells. Notably, there was a rise in the metaphase II population detected in

16

the triple mutant (25%) over the other mutants that might be due to the combined effect of

17

persistent cohesin and removal of Spo11 similar to what has been reported for the PCLB2-

18

CDC20 spo11∆ cells (Lee and Amon, 2003). Nevertheless, these results further support that

19

the cohesin dissolution is defective in cin8∆ kip3∆.

(Buonomo et al., 2000; Challa et al., 2019), we analyzed the homolog segregation in the bi-

23

nucleated cells harboring homozygous CenV-GFP (Fig. 6A). Such cells with proper homolog

24

disjunction will exhibit an equal number of CenV-GFP foci in each nucleus (2:2, Type I)

25

whereas non-disjunction will result in unequal GFP foci distribution (1:0, 1:3, 4:0; Type II).

26

We detected Type II phenotype in approximately 26% of cin8∆ kip3∆ cells over 12% in wild-

27

type. Notably, a unique third category (around 17%, Type III) was observed only in cin8∆

28

kip3∆ where the CenV-GFP dots were present at the middle of a stretched DAPI. We believe

29

the type III phenotype was generated as the sustained cohesin perturbs chiasmata resolution

30

and impedes disjunction of the homolog ssince we observed a significant reduction in the

31

distance between the two homologs in the bi-nucleated meiosis I cells (Figure 6B). In support

32

of this, the removal of chiasmata by spo11∆ resulted in the reduction of the type III

33

phenotype in cin8∆ kip3∆ spo11∆ cells (Fig. 6A). However, spo11∆ caused increased Type II

1

frequency as loss of homolog pairing is known to perturb homolog bi-orientation and their

2

disjunction (Buonomo et al., 2000; Klapholz et al., 1985).

3

A blockage in Rec8 cleavage in separase mutant, esp1-1 hinders nuclear separation,

4

however, following a prolonged arrest the cells embark on abrupt meiosis II (Buonomo et al.,

5

2000). Since homolog non-disjunction was found impaired in cin8∆ kip3∆ bi-nucleated cells

6

which include both anaphase I as well as metaphase II cells (Fig. 6A), we examined meiosis I

7

and II nuclear segregations in the cells harboring two (Fig.6C) and four (Fig. 6D) SPBs,

8

respectively. Given that cohesin retention in cin8∆ kip3∆ is not due to Pds1 stability (Fig.

9

5A-D), we argued that these cells would progress through meiosis I in spite of having

10

physical barrier in nuclear separation. As expected we observed a significant population of

11

the post-anaphase I cells in cin8∆ kip3∆ within complete nuclear division as evident from the

12

‘stretched’ nuclear morphology (approximately 40%; Fig. 6C).

13

We also observed a meager population (approximately 10%) of anaphase I cells with

14

three connecting nuclear lobes (‘crossed’ morphology) only in cin8∆ kip3∆. This category of

15

DAPI segregation resembles the one obtained in FEAR mutants resulting from the initiation

16

of meiosis II on the meiosis I spindle (Marston et al., 2003). The population of cells under

17

‘stretched’ and ‘crossed’ categories either evade meiosis II forming dyads (Fig. 2B) or they

18

abruptly enter into meiosis II where they mostly showed asymmetric (26%) and no nuclear

19

separation (mono-nucleates; 41%) with 4 SPBs (Fig.6D). Similar phenotypes were observed

20

in mam1∆ cells due to delayed nuclear division (Toth et al., 2000). Further, due to prolonged

21

anaphase I and subsequent abrupt initiation of meiosis II, there was a significant difference in

22

the length of the two spindles in meiosis II in around 34% cin8∆ kip3∆ cells (Fig. 6E). This

23

phenotype is similar to the one observed in meiosis II cells of mam1∆ in budding yeast (Toth

24

et al., 2000) and recombination-defective mutant, rec8 in S. pombe (Yamamoto et al., 2008)

25

where the common responsible factor is the delayed nuclear separation.

Kip1 degradation is delayed in cin8∆ kip3∆

2

In cin8∆ kip3∆ cells, although delayed, spindle elongation does occur and we believe

3

that Kip1 executes this function in a protracted way. In mitosis, Kip1 is degraded during the

4

onset of anaphase by Cdc20 (Hildebrandt and Hoyt, 2001). To investigate if Kip1 becomes

5

more stable in the absence of Cin8 and Kip3, we compared the Kip1 level by immunoblotting

6

between the wild-type and cin8∆ kip3∆ cells during different stages of meiosis (Fig.7A-B).

7

Given the difference in the pace of the cell cycle, the 10 h stage of wild-type was considered

8

equivalent to the 12 h of cin8∆ kip3∆ as the percentage of tetra-nucleated cells were observed

9

almost similar (Fig. 7C). Kip1 was found stable for longer duration in cin8∆ kip3∆ than in the

10

wild-type (Fig. 7A-B). To further examine this we monitored the localization of Kip1 in the

11

wild-type and cin8∆ kip3∆ undergoing meiosis using live cell imaging. Stages were judged

12

on the basis of number of SPB and the distance between two SPBs’. In anaphase I cells, Kip1

13

was either localized along the spindle (42%) or near the poles (12%) while in 46% of cells

14

Kip1 was absent suggesting it degrades towards the end of meiosis I. In contrast, Kip1 was

15

absent in only 4% of anaphase I cells in cin8∆ kip3∆ (Fig.7D). In metaphase II while almost

16

100% wild-type cells showed polar localization of Kip1, almost 45% of the cin8∆ kip3∆ cells

17

exhibited single spindle-like localization spanning the 4 SPBs suggesting that Kip1

18

degradation is defered in the latter cells (Fig. 7E). However, overall Kip1 level was not

19

altered as determined by comparing Kip1-EGFP intensity between the wild-type and cin8∆

20

kip3∆ at anaphase I and metaphase II (Fig. 7F-G). For intensity measurement within

21

anaphase I cells only spindle-localized Kip1-EGP intensity was compared between the wild-

22

type and the mutant. These results indicate that in absence of Cin8 and Kip3, spindle

23

elongation can still be possible perhaps through positive regulation of Kip1 function. The

24

presence of Kip1 along the spindle in metaphase II cin8∆ kip3∆ cells points towards longer

25

stability of this protein.

The tension generated by the microtubule mediated force drives efficient Rec8 removal

4

From the above results, it is evident that in the absence of both Cin8 and Kip3, Rec8

5

is not efficiently removed from the chromatin and that condition perhaps leads to

6

chromosome breakage during meiosis II. What could be the reason for Rec8 retention when

7

Cin8 and Kip3 are not present? We argue that in cin8∆ kip3∆ cells due to the absence of

8

microtubule cross-linking and depolymerization activities, there is inadequate microtubule

9

based pulling force acting on the kinetochores and consequently the chromatids and the

10

cohesin between the sisters are not under sufficient tension both in meiosis I and meiosis II.

11

Given this, we hypothesize that generation of tension on cohesion is perhaps a novel

12

determinant for efficient Rec8 removal. If this is true, then the generation of microtubule

13

force in the cin8∆ kip3∆ cells can rescue the Rec8 cleavage and therefore chromosome

14

integrity and spore viability. To test this, we expressed in these cells a phosphodeficient allele

15

of CIN8 (Cin8-3A) that retains on the spindle and can generate force for an extended period

16

or a phosphomimic allele of CIN8 (Cin8-3D) that fails to bind to the microtubule and create

17

force and thus exhibits a diffused nuclear localization (Avunie-Masala et al., 2011). The

18

spindle localization of Cin8-3A while a diffused localization of Cin8-3D in the anaphase I

19

cells confirmed their modes of action (Fig. 8A). Remarkably, in the chromosome segregation

20

assay with homozygous CenV-GFP, we observed a drop in the percentage of tetra-nucleates

21

harboring >4 GFP dots, a readout of chromosome breakage, in cin8∆ kip3∆ Cin8-3A cells

22

(15%) compared to cin8∆ kip3∆ (29%; Type IV, Fig.8B). In accord to this the spore viability

23

obtained in cin8∆ kip3∆ (approximately 16%) was ameliorated to a great extent upon

24

expression of Cin8-3A (approximately 48%, Fig. 8C). The observed rescue effect is specific

25

to the ability of Cin8-3A to bind to the microtubule as cin8∆ kip3∆ cells expressing Cin8-3D

26

showed similar phenotypes to that of cin8∆ kip3∆ alone (Fig. 8B-C). These results indicate

27

that the tension generated by Cin8 and Kip3 collectively via microtubule perhaps create a

28

signal for efficient cleavage and subsequent removal of Rec8.

14

To further test whether tension is an additional factor required for the cohesin removal

15

in meiosis, we monitored the Rec8 localization after mimicking the loss of tension condition

16

by two distinct approaches. During meiosis I, the tension between the homologs and on the

17

cohesin is generated as the bipolar pulling force by the microtubule is opposed by chiasmata

18

formed between the non-sister chromatids and the cohesion formed between the sisters and

19

the non-sisters. We inhibited the chiasmata formation by deleting SPO11 and examined the

20

Rec8 localization and compared that with the previous results (Figs. 9A and 4A-D). Nuclear

21

Rec8 localization was observed in around 92% of the spo11∆ anaphase I cells, which was far

22

more than observed in cin8∆ kip3∆ (65%) or in wild-type (36%; Figs. 9A and 4A-C)

suggesting loss of tension indeed resists efficient cohesin removal. However, as the spo11∆

2

cells proceeded to meiosis II, Rec8 staining pattern in metaphase II became similar to the

3

wild-type cells. This was expected since spo11∆ can alleviate tension only during meiosis I.

4

In another approach to investigate the role of tension in Rec8 removal, we depolymerized the

5

microtubules using benomyl (materials and methods) in the cells depleted for spindle

6

assembly checkpoint protein Mad2 using CLB2 promoter (Jin et al., 2009) so that the cells

7

can proceed through meiosis. We treated the cells with benomyl after 5.5 h of meiotic release

8

when most of the cells have passed the prophase I stage (Fig. 9B). In absence of Mad2,

9

benomyl treated cells were able to go through meiosis I and meiosis II although not as

10

efficient as the mock-treated cells (Fig. 9C). Due to absence of microtubules as the SPB

11

separation was improper, we were unable to distinguish between the metaphase I and

12

anaphase I cells and therefore only the cells with 4 SPBs were analyzed. We observed that a

13

notable population (69%) of cells harbored robust nuclear Rec8 staining in the benomyl

14

treated culture but no or minimal centromeric Rec8 staining in the mock-treated culture

15

(Fig.9D). This suggests that the removal of microtubules by benomyl reduces tension and that

16

in turn perturbs Rec8 cleavage. Consequently, it is expected that the benomyl treated cells

17

harboring homozygous CenV-GFP would cause chromosome breakage during meiosis II and

18

show supernumerary GFP foci. Although the DAPI segregation in the presence of a sublethal

19

concentration of benomyl was not as efficient as the mock treated culture, we observed

20

around 32% of tetra-nucleated cells with supernumerary GFP foci in the presence of the drug

21

which was meager 5% under unperturbed condition (Fig. 9E). The above two investigations

22

indicate that the reduction of tension can cause inefficient cohesin removal and we suggest

23

that this condition eventually leads to chromosome breakage as observed in the cin8∆ kip3∆

24

cells.

cells. ‘n’ represents the total number of tetra-nucleates scored for chromosome segregation. Error bars represent

15

If retention of Rec8 is responsible for chromosome breakage in the cin8∆ kip3∆ cells,

16

then removal of Rec8 in these cells should alleviate the defect. To examine this, we deleted

17

REC8 in the wild-type and cin8∆ kip3∆ strains harboring homozygous CenV-GFP. Since

18

meiosis is severely compromised in the absence of Rec8 (Klein et al., 1999), we observed

19

very less population of tetra-nucleates in rec8∆ or in cin8∆ kip3∆ rec8∆. Due to high rate of

20

chromosome non-disjunction in absence of cohesin, the percentage of tetra-nucleates with

21

GFP dots in all the four nuclei was negligible (approximately 1%, Type I, Fig. 9F); instead

22

we observed a predominant population of tetra-nucleates with GFP dots in 2 nuclei in rec8∆

23

and cin8∆ kip3∆ rec8∆ cells (47% and 58%, respectively, Type III) while the remaining

24

population contained GFP dots either in three of the four nuclei (31% and 17% in rec8∆ and

25

cin8∆ kip3∆ rec8∆, respectively, Type II) or only in one of the four nuclei (21%and 25% in

26

rec8∆ and cin8∆ kip3∆ rec8∆, respectively, Type IV). This gross chromosome mis-

27

segregation was also evident from the asymmetric DAPI staining observed in the tetra-

28

nucleates. However, as we expected, none of the triple mutant cells exhibited >4 CenV-GFP

29

dots indicating that the defective cohesin removal in the cin8∆ kip3∆ cells is indeed

30

responsible for the chromosome breakage which is also depicted in our model (Fig. 10).

Kip3, the transduction of pulling force on the chromosomes by only Kip1 through sliding of the anti-parallel

microtubules is less in the double mutant as compared to the wild-type. (II) This causes a lack of tension on the

weak kinetochore-microtubule attachment in cin8∆ kip3∆ results in homolog non-disjunction These cells after a

8

transient delay at anaphase I either form dyads or enter into meiosis II showing mono-nucleates with 4 SPBs

perhaps due to structural blockage in disjoining chromatids which can subsequently produce tetra-nucleates with

broken chromosomes. However, in some cells homolog disjunction occurs but with persistent cohesin (IV)

which results in chromosome breakage when the cells enter into meiosis II (V).

and its dislodgement from there occurs when the kinetochores are under tension (Nerusheva

2

et al., 2014). Since we observed that the absence of tension causes Rec8 protection in the

3

cin8∆ kip3∆ cells, we argued that in these cells Sgo1 may be excessively associated with the

4

chromatin driving the protection. However, we observed no significant difference in the

5

Sgo1-6HA staining profile in the chromatin spreads between the wild-type and cin8∆ kip3∆

6

cells at the bi-nucleated or the meiosis II (post-anaphase I) stage (Fig. S4B-C). Sgo1 localized

7

predominantly as clustered foci near the spindle poles in the anaphase I (Type I, Fig. S4B),

8

and meiosis II spreads (Type I, Fig. S4C) while in the remaining population multiple foci of

9

Sgo1 (Type II) were visible which presumably represented the pericentromeric distribution of

10

Sgo1 as reported earlier (Katis et al., 2004).

11

Discussion

12

Faithful chromosome segregation relies on a coordinated interaction between the

13

microtubule and the chromosomes. The molecular motors profoundly influence this

14

interaction not only by ensuring proper attachment of the kinetochores to the microtubules

15

but also by temporally and spatially regulating the microtubule spindle. Budding yeast has

16

four nuclear kinesin motors whose functions in the context of mitotic chromosome

17

segregation have been described in several studies (DeZwaan et al., 1997; Hildebrandt and

18

Hoyt, 2000; Roof et al., 1992; Winey and Bloom, 2012). However, given the differences in

19

the pattern of chromosome movement between mitosis and meiosis including two-time

20

chromosome segregation with concomitant assembly, extension and disassembly of the

21

spindle in meiosis, it is intriguing to investigate the functions of these motors in meiosis. In

22

this work, we analyzed the functions of the three microtubule plus end directed kinesin

23

motors in meiosis.

24

Loss of Cin8 perturbs homolog pairing and homolog disjunction

25

Analysis of the single motor mutants revealed that the loss of Cin8 affects meiosis

26

more than the loss of either Kip1 or Kip3 (Fig. 1). At early meiosis, Cin8 appears to promote

27

homolog pairing and consequently homolog disjunction (Fig. 1E-G) without any apparent

28

role in sister chromatid cohesion or their mono-orientation (Fig. S1). However, it is possible

29

that the roles of the motors in these events are not adequately unmasked due to functional

30

redundancy among these motors. In homolog pairing, it is required that each homolog should

demonstrated in C. elegans (Penkner et al., 2009; Sato et al., 2009). In S. pombe, the dynein

2

motors drive the ‘horsetail nuclear movement’ that facilitates homolog pairing (Wells et al.,

3

2006). In S. cerevisiae, the rapid prophase movements (RPMs) of chromosomes in meiosis I

4

is believed to occur via actin and nuclear envelope motor proteins including Mps3-Ndj1-

5

Csm4 through interactions with the telomeres (Conrad et al., 2008; Koszul et al., 2008;

6

Wanat et al., 2008). While RPM and the telomere-led movements of the chromosomes

7

promote homolog pairing, it is plausible that the nuclear kinesins may facilitate RPM or they

8

may function in pairing independently. However, the former possibility is unlikely since no

9

interaction among the nuclear envelope proteins and the kinesin motors has been

10

demonstrated. With a better microtubule cross-linking activity than the kinesin-8 motor

11

(Kip3), the kinesin-5 motors (Cin8/Kip1) may have more role in the movement of one

12

homolog with respect to the other during the search for the pairing partner. The fact that we

13

observed a more significant effect of Cin8 over Kip1 in homolog pairing and for that matter

14

in meiosis (Fig. 1E) despite both are of kinesin 5 family, is not surprising as in mitosis it has

15

been demonstrated that Cin8 plays a larger role than Kip1 in chromosome segregation

16

(Geiser et al., 1997) which is perhaps due to structural difference between these two proteins

17

(Gerson‐Gurwitz et al., 2011; Singh et al., 2018).

18

Cin8 and Kip3 together are essential for timely exit from meiosis I and completion of

19

meiosis II

20

It is intriguing that a gross drop in spore viability occurs in cin8∆ kip3∆ but not in kip1∆

21

kip3∆ double mutant (Fig.1A). Further analysis revealed that the cin8∆ kip3∆ cells share the

22

phenotypes of the FEAR mutants that include a delay in spindle elongation and disassembly

23

and generation of dyads (Figs. 1, ii-iii and 2B). We believe that this happens because Cin8

24

dephosphorylation by the FEAR-released Cdc14 is essential for maintaining Cin8 at the

25

spindle (Roccuzzo et al., 2015). Due to lack of Cdc14 in the FEAR mutant, the

26

phosphorylated form of Cin8 by Cdk1 is enriched which dissociates Cin8 from the spindle

27

(Avunie-Masala et al., 2011). Therefore, the spindle phenotypes observed in the FEAR

28

mutants of the meiotic cells resemble to the cells devoid of both Cin8 and Kip3. However,

29

notably cin8∆ mutant alone does not show a FEAR-like phenotype indicating that Kip3

30

function is parallel to Cin8 at least at the spindle and its function might be similarly

31

modulated by the absence of Cdc14. Although Kip3 function has not been reported to be

32

regulated by Cdc14, in a screen using yeast proteomic library, Kip3 was identified as one of

33

the Cdk1 substrates (Ubersax et al., 2003). Given Cdc14 is known to undo most of the Cdk1

mediated phosphorylations and in S. pombe, one of the kinesin-8, Klp-6 is a substrate of

2

Cdc14 homolog Clp1 (Chen et al., 2013), it is possible that Cdc14 might regulate the Kip3

3

function in S. cerevisiae. In addition, similar to the FEAR mutants, cin8∆ kip3∆ cells mostly

4

showed reductional segregation in the two spores of the dyads. However, some cells did

5

complete meiosis II and produce tetra-nucleates but with dire consequences as discussed

6

below.

7

Improper cohesin removal in cin8∆ kip3∆ cells causes chromosome breakage in meiosis

8

The finding of >4 CenV-GFP foci in the homozygously GFP marked cin8∆ kip3∆

9

cells specifically in meiosis but not in mitosis was surprising (Figs. 2E-F and Fig. S3B).

10

Further analysis revealed that this happens due to chromosome breakage in those cells that

11

attempt to complete meiosis II (Fig. 2G). Unexpectedly, our investigations suggest that this

12

breakage is due to improper removal of cohesin from the chromatin during both metaphase I

13

to anaphase I and metaphase II to anaphase II transitions (Figs. 4 and 5A-D). We believe that

14

anaphase I delay in cin8∆ kip3∆ cells, besides lack of sliding of the antiparallel microtubules,

15

is also due to inefficient removal of the cohesin from the arm regions and hence the

16

resolution of chiasmata as we observed that removal of chiasmata could rescue the defect of

17

prolonged anaphase I (Fig. S4A).

18

In S. cerevisiae, Rec8 removal from the chromatin is achieved by the protease

19

separase that is released due to degradation of securin, Pds1. However, in cin8∆ kip3∆ cells,

20

we observed uncoupling of Pds1 degradation from Rec8 removal (Fig. 5A-D). Thus it is

21

reasonable to propose that in meiosis efficient Rec8 cleavage perhaps requires additional

22

factor besides the release of separase.

23

Microtubule based tension: a novel determinant to cleave Rec8 - but not Mcd1-cohesin?

24

It is important to address why Rec8 removal is compromised in absence of Cin8 and

25

Kip3 together. Both Cin8 and Kip3 localize at the kinetochore where Kip3 is a part of the

26

core kinetochore and is involved in kinetochore-microtubule attachment (Tytell and Sorger,

27

2006). On the other hand lack of both Cin8 and Kip3, but not individually, causes reduced

28

transient separation of the sister kinetochores over the wild-type in the pre-anaphase mitotic

29

cells (Tytell and Sorger, 2006) and we noticed that metaphase to anaphase transition is

30

delayed (Fig. S2C). These results suggest that Cin8 and Kip3 together are involved in force

31

generation on the chromosomes towards the opposite spindle poles which is consistent with

32

the fact that these motors have microtubule cross-linking (Gordon and Roof, 1999;

33

Hildebrandt et al., 2006; Su et al., 2013a) and depolymerase activities (Gardner et al., 2008;
33

1

Su et al., 2013b; Su et al., 2011b). Therefore, in cin8∆ kip3∆ meiotic cells the homologs are

2

not under tension in meiosis I and so are the sisters in meiosis II. We propose a model (Fig.

3

10) where the efficient cleavage of Rec8 both in meiosis I and II requires that the homologs

4

and the sisters, respectively must be under tension. In support of this, in a phosphodeficient

5

Cin8 mutant that remains bound to the spindle for longer and can generate force, the Rec8

6

removal is supposedly better and hence we observed less chromosome breakage and

7

improved spore viability which was found opposite in case of a phosphomimic mutant that

8

fails to bind to the spindle and generate force (Fig. 8B-C). To reconfirm our tension model of

9

Rec8 cleavage, we created tensionless condition by removing either chiasmata (SPO11) or

10

microtubules in a Mad2 depleted strains and observed defective Rec8 removal in both the

11

conditions (Fig. 9A and D). Importantly, we failed to observe any perturbation in Mcd1

12

removal in the cin8∆ kip3∆ cells (Fig. 5E) and believe that is why the cells perform better in

13

mitosis (Fig. S2D-E). To address how tension might drive Rec8 but not Mcd1 cleavage, we

14

reason that the tension by some means may promote phosphorylation of Rec8 and earlier

15

studies have shown that phosphorylation of Rec8, but not Mcd1, is indispensable for cohesin

16

cleavage (Alexandru et al., 2001; Attner et al., 2013; Lee and Amon, 2003). The tension can

17

influence maintenance of certain proteins on the chromatin responsible for Rec8

18

phosphorylation or a direct effect of tension on the cohesin may expose the Rec8 sites for

19

phosphorylation. Alternatively, the tension may facilitate phosphorylated Rec8 amenable to

20

cleavage by separase. It is possible that in cin8∆ kip3∆ cells, the spindle assembly checkpoint

21

becomes activated as there is loss of tension and faulty kinetochore-microtubule attachment

22

which can keep APC inactivated and resist cohesin cleavage. However, we believe this is

23

unlikely as we observed Pds1 degradation occurred in the double mutant at a normal pace of

24

the cell cycle (Fig. 5B and D). To explain why a tension based mechanism has evolved to

25

sensitize cohesin removal in meiosis, it can be argued that in this cell cycle, unlike mitosis,

26

chiasmata are formed and removal of arm cohesin is required for their resolution. During

27

resolution, the ‘terminalization’ of the cross-over point that occurs due to pulling of the

28

homologs might subject arms cohesin under tension that perhaps signals their removal.

29

However, how prolonged retention of cohesin with reduced tension acting on the

30

chromosomes (due to absence of Cin8 and Kip3) can eventually lead to chromosome

31

breakage is not clear from our study. We observed that in the cin8∆ kip3∆ cells spindle

32

disassembly is delayed (Fig. 1C) and Kip1 activity is protracted (Fig.7). Additionally, loss of

33

these proteins can potentially cause abnormally extended kinetochore-microtubules since

34

they also possess the microtubule depolymerase activity (Gardner et al., 2008; Su et al.,

2013a; Su et al., 2011a). It is plausible that when these conditions together prevail over an

2

extended period of time spanning two rounds of spindle assembly/disassembly and

3

chromosome movement in meiosis, an imbalance of force is generated on the chromosomes

4

causing them to break. In summary, we report here for the first time about the requirement of

5

tension in the efficient removal of cohesin in meiosis and the importance of kinesin-5 and

6

kinesin-8 motors in promoting this event and thus maintaining chromosome integrity. Given

7

meiosis and the functions of kinesins are conserved across eukaryotes, it would be tempting

8

to investigate if an attenuation of motor functions could be one of the reasons to generate

9

aneuploid gametes that occurs at an alarming rate during human gametogenesis.

10

Experimental procedures

11

Yeast strains and Media

12

All the strains used in this study were of SK1 background. The list of the strains and

13

plasmids with the genotype is mentioned in Table S1.The plasmids utilized for the C-terminal

14

protein tagging and deletion of a gene are from Euroscarf and were PCR based (Wach et al.,

15

1997). Transformation of the cells with the PCR cassettes was performed as mentioned

16

earlier (Gietz and Schiestl, 2007). In case of selecting the cells on a dropout media along with

17

the antibiotic G418, the media was used as mentioned earlier (Cheng et al., 2000) where

18

instead of ammonium sulfate, monosodium glutamate was used to restore the sensitivity of

19

G418. For metaphase I and prophase I arrest, PCLB2 and PGAL1 constructs were used to shuffle

20

the endogenous promoters of CDC20 and NDT80, respectively as mentioned earlier

21

(Benjamin et al., 2003; Lee and Amon, 2003). For chromosome segregation assay,

22

chromosome V and chromosome III were marked with GFP by integrating repeats of tet

23

operators at 1.4 kb and lac operators at 22 kb away from the centromeres, respectively in a

24

cell expressing TetR-GFP and LacI-GFP, respectively (Straight et al., 1996; Tanaka et al.,

25

2000).

26

Fluorescence microscopy

27

For live cell imaging, 1ml of 1 O.D600 culture was fixed with formaldehyde (final

28

concentration 5%) for 5-10 min. The pellet was washed two times with 0.1M phosphate

29

buffer (pH 7.5). For DAPI staining, after fixation of the sample with formaldehyde, the pellet

30

was washed once with 50% ethanol and then resuspended in DAPI with the final

31

concentration of 1µg/ml. The image was acquired with z-stacking (spacing 0.5 µm) using

32

AxioObserver Z1 Zeiss inverted microscope (63X 1.4 NA Objective). Processing and

1

merging of images were done using AxioVs40 V 4.8.2.0 software. Exposure time was set

2

according to the fluorescence signal and was kept constant among the samples used for

3

comparison (mainly it was 1.5s for EGFP, CFP, and mcherry fluorophores excitation). In

4

order to avoid the bleed-through of intense Spc42-CFP signal though GFP channel, Zeiss

5

confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 780) equipped with 32 array GaAsP detector was

6

used. Images were acquired using Zeiss Zen 2012 software.

7

Image analysis

8

Images were generated by merging the planes projecting maximum intensity and were

9

further analyzed. The quantification of fluorescent intensity of the images acquired using

10

Zeiss Axio observerZ1 was performed using ImageJ software. A region of interest covering

11

the fluorescence signal was defined and the integrated intensity of that region was estimated,

12

following background reduction, by averaging the integrated intensity of three random non-

13

fluorescent areas multiplied by the area of the fluorescent signal region. Estimation of

14

number of Rad52 or Rec8 foci per chromosome spread was performed using an automatic

15

spot detection algorithm (Imaris3D reconstitution software), keeping the threshold limit

16

constant for all the images.

17

Growth conditions and meiotic induction

18

Before meiotic induction, the cells were patched on YPG (yeast extract 1% peptone

19

2%, glycerol 2%) to restrain the growth of the petite colonies and then were transferred to

20

presporulation medium for overnight. This was followed by meiotic induction in sporulation

21

medium (0.02% raffinose, 1% potassium acetate) as mentioned elsewhere (Cha et al., 2000;

22

Mehta et al., 2014).

23

In order to prevent the loss of centromeric plasmid containing mutated ORF of CIN8

24

in the presporulation medium (PSP2) used for the meiosis synchronization, instead of yeast

25

extract potassium acetate (YPA) medium, selective medium (SC–Uradropout) supplemented

26

with 0.1% yeast extract was used (Roth and Halvorson, 1969; Simchen et al., 1972).

27

For mitotic synchronization, the cells were arrested at G1 using α-factor at a

28

concentration of 5 µg/ml in 0.3 O.D600 of cells (Cui et al., 2009; Prajapati et al., 2017). After

29

3 h when >90% cells exhibited the shmoo formation, they were washed and released into

30

fresh YPD medium.

31

For enhancing the expression of LacI-GFP that is under the control of the HIS3

32

promoter, 3-aminotriazole was added at the final concentration of 20 mM in the sporulation

33

medium.

Unlike mitosis, microtubule disruption before or during meiotic S phase causes cells

2

to arrest at G1 or G2 phase, respectively (Hochwagen et al., 2005). Therefore, for

3

microtubule depolymerization in meiosis, the cells were treated with benomyl at a

4

concentration of 60 µg/ml after 5.5 h of meiotic induction when most of the cells passed

5

through S phase. Stages of the cell cycle and microtubule morphology before and after the

6

drug treatment were determined by tubulin immunofluorescence. In order to avoid the spindle

7

checkpoint mediated arrest in the absence of microtubule, Mad2 was depleted in meiosis

8

using CLB2 promoter (Jin et al., 2009).

9

Comet assay

10

Comet assay was performed as mentioned earlier (Oliveira and Johansson, 2012).

11

After the meiotic induction in the SPM for 8h, 1 ml of sporulating culture with a

12

concentration of 107 cells per ml was harvested. Cells were then resuspended in the buffer (1

13

M sorbitol, 25 mM KH2PO4, 50 mM β-mercaptoethanol) containing Zymolase - 20T

14

(20mg/ml - MP biomedicals). pH of the buffer was adjusted to 6.5 using NaOH. The cells

15

were then incubated for half an hour for making spheroplasts. Spheroplasted cells were then

16

mixed with 1.5% low-melting-point (LMP) agarose and spreaded immediately on the glass

17

slide precoated with 0.5% normal melting point (NMP) agarose. Slides were placed on ice for

18

agarose to solidify for which the embedded cells form cavities in the gel. Subsequently, the

19

slides were submerged into lysing buffer (30 mM NaOH, 1 M NaCl, 0.05% sodium dodecyl

20

sulfate, 50 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 10) for 20 min at 4°C. Following lysis of the

21

spheroplasts, the cavities formed by the spheroplasted cells contained only high molecular

22

weight DNA while the other biomolecules diffused out. The slides were then placed in the

23

electrophoresis buffer (30 mM NaOH, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 10) at 4°C for 20

24

min for the unwinding of the DNA which was followed by electrophoresis for 20 min at

25

0.7V/cm. On application of the electric current of 300 mA at 24V, the fragmented DNA,

26

named as the ‘tail’, moved towards the anode (+) while the compact mass of DNA remained

27

in the cavity giving a ‘comet’-like appearance on the gel. Following this, the slides were

28

incubated into the neutralization buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) at room temperature for 10

29

min. The slides were incubated in 76% and 96% ethanol for 10 min each at room

30

temperature. The slides were then incubated with solution containing ethidium bromide

31

(10µg/ml) for 5 min and were observed using epifluorescence microscope (excitation filter

32

546 nm; emission filter 575 nm). The wild-type cells treated with 10 mM concentration of

33

H2O2 were used as positive control.

Immunostaining

2

Immunostaining was performed as described earlier (Mehta et al., 2014). The cells

3

from the meiotic culture were harvested and fixed with 5% formaldehyde. The spheroplasts

4

were made using zymolyase, and were placed on a polylysine-coated slide. The spheroplasts

5

were permeabilized by Triton X-100 or methanol/acetone and were then incubated with

6

primary followed by secondary antibody. DAPI (4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) at a

7

concentration of 1 μg/ml in 0.1 M phosphate buffer was used to stain the DNA. Primary

8

antibodies

9

(11667149001; Roche) were used at a dilution of 1:5000 and 1:200, respectively. The

10

secondary antibodies used from Jackson were TRITC goat anti-rat (115-485-166), Alexa-

11

fluor 488 goat anti-rat (112-545-167), and TRITC goat anti-mouse (115-025-166) at a

12

dilution of 1:200.

14

Protocol for chromosome spread formation was followed as mentioned elsewhere

15

(Mehta et al., 2014; Prajapati et al., 2018). 2 ml of meiotic culture was spheroplasted using

16

20T zymolase (10mg/ml) for 1 h with 1.42 M β-ME. The reaction was stopped by addition of

17

200 µl stop solution (0.1 M MES, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 1 M sorbitol, pH 6.4).

18

Spheroplasted cells were fixed on acid washed slides with paraformaldehyde solution (4%

19

paraformaldehyde, 3.4% sucrose with 2 drops of NaOH to dissolve paraformaldehyde)

20

followed by addition of 1% lipsol to burst the cells. The slides were kept to dry overnight at

21

room temperature after homogenously smearing the spheroplasts on the slide. Next day the

22

slides were washed with 2 ml of 0.4% photoflow-200 (Kodak) followed by washing in

23

phosphate buffer saline for 10 minutes. Before addition of primary antibodies, 100 µl of

24

blocking solution (5% skim milk) was added to the slide for 30 minutes. Primary antibodies

25

were diluted in PBS supplemented with 0.1% BSA (bovine serum albumin). Primary

26

antibodies used were rabbit anti-Zip1 (SC 33733; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:100), mouse

27

anti-HA (MMS-101P; Covance, 1:200), mouse anti-GFP (11814460001; Roche, 1:200).

28

Slides are coated with 100 µl of primary antibody for 1 hour followed by washing with PBS

29

three times with 5 min incubation each time. Similar treatment with secondary antibody was

30

performed. Jackson secondary antibodies - TRITC goat anti-rat and Alexa-fluor 488 goat

31

anti-mouse (115-485-166) were used at the dilution of 1:200. Chromatin was stained using

32

DAPI.

Immunoblotting and its quantification

2

Whole cell proteins were extracted by NaOH treatment as described earlier

3

(Kushnirov, 2000) with some modifications. Cells from 10 ml of 1 O.D 600 culture were

4

pelleted down and treated with 0.1N NaOH for 30 min. After alkaline treatment, pelleted

5

cells were resuspended in electrophoresis sample buffer (ESB; 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 80

6

mM Tris pH 6.8, 2% bromophenol blue, 100 mM dithiothreitol; Dunn, 1986) and boiled for 5

7

min at 100°C.

immunoblotting. Primary antibody rabbit anti-Myc (ab9106; Abcam) was used at the dilution

9

of 1:5000 in 1:20 TBST:5% skim milk. Jackson HRP conjugated secondary antibodies used

10

for the detection were goat anti-mouse (115-035-166; 1:5000), goat anti-rabbit (111-035-003;

11

1:10000), and goat anti-rat (112-035-167; 1:10000). Blots were developed using ECL

12

reagents (170-5060; Bio-Rad laboratories). The intensities of the bands at different time

13

points were quantified using ImageJ software. The ratio of the protein bands to the loading

14

control band was used for the comparison between the wild-type and mutant strains.
