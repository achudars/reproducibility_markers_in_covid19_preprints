Abstract

27
28

The principle and techniques applied in DNA extraction play a pivotal role in the obtention

29

of a considerable and purified yield of genetic material. In this work, we evaluate the

30

efficiency of seven protocols chosen from literature for the DNA extraction of Hypostomus

31

commersoni (Valenciennes, 1836), an important component of South American freshwater

32

ichthyofauna. We also proposed and evaluate an improved protocol, based on the

33

combination of variables from the selected methodologies that demonstrated higher

34

potential for extracting H. commersoni DNA. The quality of samples was assessed through

35

spectrophotometry, gel electrophoresis and PCR-RAPD amplification. The efficiency of

36

DNA extraction was influenced both by the method applied and target-tissue of choice.

37

Higher concentrations and yield of DNA were obtained from ocular tissue, with a positive

38

spectrum of incubation in lysis buffer for up to 36 hours after sample collection, without

39

maceration, using fresh tissues and in the presence of high concentration of Proteinase K.

40

In these conditions, samples were successfully amplified using a set of primers from

41

Operon Technologies. To date, there is no record of description for the parameters

42

analyzed in this work, neither the description of RAPD markers for H. commersoni,

43

evidencing the importance of our findings.

Introduction

52

A crucial step for high quality genetic analysis is considered to be a satisfactory DNA

53

extraction. Nevertheless, this purpose is not always easy to achieve, since different

54

biological compounds, such as lipids and proteins, can act as contaminants and interfere in

55

the final quality of the product [1]. The principles and techniques applied in DNA

56

extraction play a pivotal role in obtaining a considerable and purified yield of this molecule

57

[2].

58

A variety of methods has been established to isolate DNA from biological materials

59

[3,6]. Regardless the method of choice, the procedure usually consists of three steps: lysis,

60

purification and DNA recovery, being the first the most critical stage, since is at this point

61

that the chances of causing DNA damages are higher [7].

62

The quality and amount of available DNA strand template have a major influence

63

on genetic analyzes based on PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction), for example [8,9].

64

Therefore, an ideal extraction technique should optimize DNA yield, minimize DNA

65

degradation, and be efficient in terms of cost, time, labor, and supplies [10].

66

With the availability of a plethora of molecular analysis machinery, there is an

67

exponential demand for high quality samples, capable to generate great results with

68

minimum of errors. To meet these requirements, commercial kits were developed, aiming

69

for DNA extractions of excellence [11-13].

70

However, the market price of this products it is not always easily affordable to

71

every laboratory [10, 14]. In the other hand, the extraction of genetic material with non-

72

commercial reagents is less costly due to the use of homemade reagents and, therefore,

73

such methodologies can be applied in laboratories with less financial resources.

74

Stablish a well succeed protocol for DNA extraction is a very important step in

75

genetic analysis, considering that the same method may present variations between

76

different organisms [15]. Furthermore, the quality of isolated DNA through methods

77

described for other taxa, may present unsatisfactory results when applied to fish species

78

[2].

79

H. commersoni (Valenciennes, 1836), commonly known as suckermouth catfish, is

80

an important component of freshwater ichthyofauna, inhabiting the Paraná and Uruguay

81

basins, in South America [16, 17]. This taxon is marked by its ecological and commercial

82

relevance [18-22], and, despite that, there is no record of description of well-succeed DNA

83

extraction protocol nor PCR-RAPD markers to date.

84

In this work, we evaluated seven protocols chosen from literature in the extraction

85

of genomic DNA of H. commersoni and, also, we propose an improved method, aiming to

86

obtain high quality and purified DNA samples of this specie.

DNA Extraction

101

All DNA was extracted and quantified at the biochemistry and molecular biology

102

laboratory of URI (Regional Integrated University, Erechim-RS/Brazil).

103
104

Protocols and variables analyzed in the DNA extraction

105

Seven protocols from literature were selected for DNA extraction of H. commersoni,

106

whose methodologies had previously been described for fish species or whose parameters

107

were similar to those intended to be analyzed in this work, such as the same extraction

108

conditions and target tissues (Box 1). An eighth protocol, elaborated by the combination of

109

the variables that presented better potential to extract H. commersonii DNA in each of the

110

seven previously tested protocols, was proposed and evaluated too.

Analysis of DNA integrity

146

The integrity of the obtained samples was verified through agarose gel (0,8%)

147

electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide (1 mg/ml). The reaction run for 150

148

minutes at 90 volts and the visualization and image caption of the gel were obtained under

149

ultraviolet (UV) light.

150
151

Evaluation of concentration and purity of DNA

152

The samples whose extraction was successful and did not result in DNA degradation

153

according to the electrophoresis, where submitted to spectrophotometry and analyzed for

154

protein contamination (purity). Samples were quantified in a spectrophotometer (model NI

155

1600UV - Nova Instruments), at A260 and A280 nanometers (nm). The purity of the DNA

156

was confirmed by the ratio of absorbance values at the two wavelengths measured [33].

157

The DNA concentration of each sample was determined by the equation: [DNA] = 50

158

µg/ml x D (dilution factor) x A260 (read value obtained in the wavelength of 260 nm).

159

Satisfactory purity values were considered to be ranging between 1.7-2.0.

161

DNA amplification by PCR-RAPD (Polymerase Chain Reaction

162

- Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA)

163

Samples that reached the aforementioned parameters of DNA concentration and yield were

164

submitted to amplification with different primers of PCR-RAPD. In total, 32 primers from

165

Operon Technologies kits OPA (01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09), OPB (03, 05, 07, 10,

167

(01,02,03) were tested. Ten nanograms of genomic DNA was amplified in PCR buffer (20

168

mM Tris-Hcl pH8.4, 50 mM KCL), 4 mM MgCl2, 0.7 mM dNTPs, 0.3 μM primers e 1

170

volume of 25 µL, in the following conditions: denaturation at 95ºC for 30 s, annealing at

171

50ºC for 1 min e extension at 72ºC for 5 min, totaling 40 cycles. The amplification

172

products were applied in agarose gel (1.5%), stained with ethidium bromide (1 mg/ml).

Statistical analysis

177

Statistical analysis was performed using Python (version 3.6.0). Differences between DNA

178

extraction methods in total DNA concentration were determined using ANOVA with

179

Results

182

DNA extraction method impacts DNA yield

183

Our work corroborated that even a method that uses in-house produced reagents instead of

184

commercial kits is capable to extract DNA with sufficient quality to be used in molecular

185

analysis, as PCR-RAPD. The amount of DNA extracted was dependent on the DNA

186

extraction technique and the target-tissue of choice. For all variables examined, the

187

improved extraction method developed and proposed at this work, produced the greatest

188

total DNA mean yields, for all tissues, resulting in significantly higher absorbance ratios

189

when compared to the seven other extraction methods. Different variables also affect in

190

different ways the extraction of DNA, as showed in Table 1.

Improved protocol for DNA extraction of H. commersoni

199

The eighth protocol evaluated, improved and proposed in this work, in general, presented

200

the highest efficiency in the extraction of H. commersoni DNA. The samples submitted to

201

extraction through this protocol were the only ones that amplified with PCR-RAPD

202

primers, since they had the best DNA concentration and yield of purify DNA in the

203

samples (according to the absorbance ratio of 260/280 nanometers).

Analysis of DNA integrity in electrophoresis gel

214

All samples from the six tissues and the eight applied conditions were submitted to gel

215

electrophoresis in triplicate, resulting in a total count of 144 samples. The ocular tissue

216

presented the highest integrity of extracted DNA, in all combinations of variables and

217

protocols. For all tissues, the main bands of DNA were around 46-48 kb in size.

218

Comparing protocols, the EDTA methods (P2, P7 and P8) showed relatively lighter smear

219

tails, indicating less DNA degradation.

extractions performed using protocol 3 (216 ng/μl), while the highest mean concentration

251

of DNA was obtained with protocol 8 (438 ng/μl). Statistically, as indicated by the lower

252

case letters, there is no significant difference between most of the samples whose DNA

253

was extracted from the tissues dorsal fin, caudal fin, gills and muscle. The major

exceptions were blood and ocular tissue, which had similar p value for most of the

evaluated protocols.

256

Although the total amount of DNA present high values and several samples were

257

statistically similar, the mean values of the absorbance ratio are the important data, once

258

concerns the purity of samples and DNA amount. The absorbance ratio values were 1.2

(protocol 4), 1.3 (protocols 2, 3, 6 and 7), 1.4 (protocols 1 and 5) and 1.8 (protocol 8),

DNA extraction method influences PCR-RAPD amplification

264

All samples were subject to PCR-RAPD analysis, but only the ones extracted with protocol

265

8 amplified with the selected primers. Of the 34 primers tested, 9 amplified the DNA of the

266

evaluated specie in the concentrations of 40 and 20 ng/µl and were described in this work.

267

These markers present potential to be used in studies evaluating the genetic structure of

268

ocular tissue samples of H. commersoni through PCR-RAPD markers.

269

The score of bands varied between the amplifications using different concentrations

270

of DNA (Table 4). The concentration of 20 ng/μl generated the major count of fragments,

271

followed by the concentration of 40 ng/μl. The concentration of 10 ng/μl of DNA did not

272

amplify with the primers OPW05, OPW06, OPW07, OPW08 and OPW09, and, therefore,

273

this concentration is the less indicated for use in the PCR-RAPD reaction with this set of

274

primers and specie, according to our findings.

Discussion

279

The relevance in evaluating different protocols for DNA extraction and the description of

280

an efficient method for the specie H. commersoni is justified by the fact that obtaining high

281

quality samples is crucial for studying organisms at genetic level. Specifically, in the case

282

of H. commersoni, there are few molecular, genetic and/or phylogenetic data available in

283

the literature. The information compilated at this work may allow future analyzes of

284

molecular characterization of the group and, nevertheless, the techniques described here

285

have potential to be used to study other organisms or fish species

286

In this work, we proposed a methodology based in the DNA extraction from ocular

287

tissue and, to our knowledge, there is no record of this parameter for any fish species to

288

date. The use of this tissue may present some limitations, such its availability in number

289

and size, but our results indicate that this organ have a great potential as source for extract

290

good quality genomic DNA in H. commersoni and possibly in other fish species.

291

This technique can be useful in cases where DNA extraction is performed using

292

samples belonging to scientific collections, where the specimens have already bein

293

euthanized, or when an alternative model of extraction source is required, once the

294

classical ones have been exhausted without present a positive result.

295

During the test period, all the steps that presented promising results regarding the

296

primary objective of our study were selected, aiming to group them into a single protocol,

297

considered the "ideal" for the H. commersoni species. In this way, it is possible to discuss

298

some of the characteristics that presented better efficiency in terms of quantity and quality

299

of isolated DNA.

300

The use of liquid nitrogen for tissue maceration in DNA isolation, especially in

301

solid tissues, is a method described as efficient according to several findings [35].

302

However, in this work, it has not been shown to be a factor influencing the quality or

303

quantity of product obtained. This data is important because it results in a protocol of lower

304

cost and greater ease of execution, facilitating the application of this methodology in a

305

larger number of laboratories and research groups.

306

The addition of RNAse is suggested as important in protocols for extracting fish

307

DNA, being used in the steps of breaking tissues and flakes, in order to eliminate the

308

contamination of the samples by RNA and to increase DNA yield [30]. However, in this

309

study the use of RNAse had no effect on DNA extraction. For all protocols and variables

310

tested, RNAse did not involve more pure or concentrated samples, even when evaluated in

311

several gradients and at different stages of each protocol. The possibility of eliminating the

312

use of RNAse during DNA extraction also results in the development of a lower cost

313

protocol.

314

Other variables, however, corroborated with information found in the literature,

315

such as the use of proteinase K to increase extraction efficiency, especially at temperatures

316

of sample incubation up to 55 ºC. Proteinase K digestion is characterized by the

317

purification of quality DNA for genetic analyzes such as PCR [31, 32].

318

One of the most promising results was the possibility of exploring different

319

incubation times of the samples in the extraction buffer, with a proven spectrum of

320

efficiency in 1, 12, 24 and 36 hours, using the ocular tissue of H. commersoni. The

321

advantages related to this discovery are the possibility of extracting the DNA in a single

322

day (1 hour at 55 ºC), incubating the samples overnight, or, furthermore, being able to

323

postpone extraction after its incubation in lysis buffer, until 36 hours at room temperature

324

of approximately 25 ° C. This result is also important because it facilitates the transport of

325

material where the specimens can be euthanized in the field and the ocular tissue

326

maintained in lysis buffer for up to 36 hours without the need for refrigeration or any other

327

form of preservation until the DNA can be extracted in adequate conditions.

328

In general, all 7 protocols chosen from the literature and evaluated in this work

329

presented relative efficiency in the extraction of H. commersoni DNA, despite some

330

limitations, when evaluating the concentration indices obtained from each sample.

331

However, when the values were submitted to the absorbance ratio equation, it is evident

332

that the protocol proposed in this paper was the one that obtained the highest DNA purity

333

values in the samples.

334

The protocol that presented higher efficiency is a simple and economic method to

335

obtain DNA from H. commersoni, with the potential to be applied in other similar species.

336

Following the methodology described in our improved protocol, it was possible to submit

337

the samples to the amplification reaction, using primers for PCR-RAPD. The samples from

338

the other protocols were submitted to the same analysis, but without success.

339

Under optimal conditions, a single cell contains broadly DNA to serve as a template

340

for PCR reactions. The usefulness of this protocol in PCR-based genetic studies was

341

confirmed through the amplification of samples using PCR-RAPD markers. Our findings

342

brought unprecedented data for H. commersoni, and this information can be applied in

343

further studies of genetic characterization of this taxon.
