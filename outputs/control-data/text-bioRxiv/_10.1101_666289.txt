The MPRAGE sequences with and without Prospective Motion Correction (PMC) are
compared in a large sample size (N=419) in a “real world” scenario, where we did
not explicitly ask subjects to move or maintain still during the acquisition of the
structural images
MPRAGE sequence with PMC (MPRAGE+PCM) presents higher intra-sequence
reliability results in morphometric measurements compared to the traditional
MPRAGE sequence without PMC.
High inter-sequence (MPRAGE with and without PMC) reliability scores were also
observed.
Researchers are recommended use the MPRAGE+PMC as their structural T1
weighted pulse imaging sequence for future and current studies, especially in
studies with hyperkinetic populations
Due to potential higher quality control measures of the traditional MPRAGE
sequence, neuroimaging researchers with low head motion participants can still

Abstract
New large neuroimaging studies, such as the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study
(ABCD) and Human Connectome Project (HCP) Development studies are adopting a new T1weighted imaging sequence with prospective motion correction (PMC) in favor of the more
traditional 3-Dimensional Magnetization-Prepared Rapid Gradient-Echo Imaging (MPRAGE)
sequence. In this study, we used a developmental dataset (ages 5-21, N=348) from the Healthy
Brain Network Initiative and directly compared the MPRAGE and MPRAGE with PMC
(MPRAGE+PMC) sequences to determine if the morphometric measurements obtained from both
protocols are equivalent or if there is an advantage to use one. The sequences were also
compared through quality control measurements. Inter- and intra-sequence reliability were
assessed with another set of participants (N=71) that performed two MPRAGE and two
MPRAGE+PMC sequences within the same imaging session, with one MPRAGE (MPRAGE1)
and MPRAGE+PMC (MPRAGE+PMC1) pair at the beginning of the session and another pair
(MPRAGE2 and MPRAGE+PMC2) at the end of the session. With morphometric measurements
such as volume and cortical thickness, Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) scores showed
that intra-sequence reliability is the highest with the MPRAGE+PMC sequences and lowest with
the MPRAGE sequences. Regarding inter-sequence reliability, ICC scores were higher for the
MPRAGE1-MPRAGE+PMC1 pair at the beginning of the session than the MPRAGE1-MPRAGE2
pair, possibly due to the higher motion artifacts in the MPRAGE2 run. Results also indicate that
the MPRAGE+PMC sequence is robust, but not foolproof, to high head motion. For quality control
metrics, the traditional MPRAGE presented better results than MPRAGE+PMC in 5 of the 7
measurements. In conclusion, morphometric measurements evaluated here showed high intersequence reliability between the MPRAGE and MPRAGE+PMC sequences, especially in images
with low head motion. Researchers conducting studies with highly kinetic populations are highly
recommended to use the MPRAGE+PMC sequence, due to its robustness to head motion and
higher reliability scores. However, due to potential higher quality control measures, neuroimaging
researchers with low head motion participants can still consider using the MPRAGE sequence,
however, can also choose to use the MPRAGE+PMC sequence to increase the reliability of the
data.

Introduction
New technologies are constantly being developed to improve the quality of Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (MRI) sequences. While generally welcomed, such advances can present a
significant challenge to longitudinal studies, as well as large-scale data acquisitions, both of which
tend to be wary of changing methods mid-study due to the potential introduction of confounds. In
light of this, choosing the optimal MRI pulse sequences for a study is always a challenging task
for a neuroimaging researcher. Since its development in the early 1990s, the T1 weighted 3Dimensional Magnetization-Prepared Rapid Gradient-Echo Imaging (3D MPRAGE, MPRAGE, or
MPR) (Mugler and Brookeman 1990; Brant-Zawadzki, Gillan, and Nitz 1992) has become one of
the most widely used sequence by neuroimaging researchers. This sequence, or similar
sequences from other manufacturers1, has been widely adopted for studies with large or small
sample sizes. However, as all MRI imaging sequences, it is susceptible to head motion which can
significantly alter the quality of the morphometry measurements that are extracted (Reuter et al.
2015; Pardoe, Kucharsky Hiess, and Kuzniecky 2016; Alexander-Bloch et al. 2016). In recent
years, the MPRAGE sequence has been expanded to include volumetric navigators (vNav) in
order to perform prospective motion correction (PMC) during the acquisition (Tisdall et al. 2012,
2016). The growing availability and usage of prospective PMC for structural scans (Tisdall et al.
2012). These structural sequences with navigator-based PMC have the potential to be
transformative for studies involving hyperkinetic populations, such as children, the elderly, or
patients with movement disorders. In particular, new large multisite studies are adopting these
structural scans with PMC (see Table 1). However, the impact of the change from the traditional
MPRAGE sequence to the now MPRAGE sequence with PMC has not been fully quantified
(Harms et al. 2018), in part, because few datasets contain a large enough sample size with and
without PMC images in the same subjects.
The ultrafast gradient-echo 3D MPRAGE pulse sequence is used by a large fraction of
neuroimaging researchers because of its excellent contrast properties and capacity to collect
reliable structural images (Wonderlick et al. 2009). MPRAGE can be considered as a defacto
standard imaging sequence for brain morphometry studies2. As such, large neuroimaging studies
such as the WU-Minn Human Connectome Project (HCP) (Van Essen et al. 2013)more recently
referred to as the HCP Young-Adult (HCP-YA)), the NKI-Rockland Sample (Nooner et al. 2012),
the UK BioBank (Sudlow et al. 2015), and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)
(Jack et al. 2008), all use the MPRAGE sequence to collect structural T1 weighted images of the
brain. While some slight differences in sequence parameters exist across studies, such as voxel
size and TR/TI values, differences in parameters tend to be very similar overall (see Table 1).
For navigator-based prospective motion correction (PMC) approaches, the sequence
periodically collects fast-acquisition lower resolution images (navigators) to estimate the amount
and direction of head motion since the last navigator was collected. Based on the motion
estimation, sequence parameters are adjusted at each repetition time (TR) to nullify this motion.
For MPRAGE sequences, navigators can be collected and motion can be estimated during the

long inversion recovery time (TI) and applied to update the readout orientation for the current line
of k-space. An early example of this method is the PROMO sequences that employs spiral
acquisitions to collect navigators along the three cardinal planes of the volume (coronal, axial,
and sagittal) (N. White et al. 2010). This has been extended by Tisdall et al. to use echo volume
imaging (EPI applied to all 3 dimensions) to collect 3D vNav, which provide more precise motion
tracking (Tisdall et al. 2012, 2016). In addition to prospectively correcting for motion that occurs
between acquisitions, this sequence with PMC can also identify large motion that occurs during
an acquisition. The TRs that have motion above a predefined threshold are reacquired at the end
of the sequence. The maximum number of TRs that can be reacquired is set by the operator. The
MPRAGE sequence with PMC (MPRAGE+PMC) has been widely adopted by research groups
and more specifically, by new large imaging studies (see Table 1).
Among those most attracted to the promises of sequences with PMC are pediatric imaging
researchers (S. Y. Bookheimer 2000) In particular, head motion has been shown to significantly
reduce gray matter volume and thickness estimates (Reuter et al. 2015) and also alter gray matter
probability scores (Gilmore, Buser, and Hanson 2019). Due to this concern, the longitudinal
Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (Casey et al. 2018) adopted the
MPRAGE+PMC sequence as its standard T1-weighted structural sequence. The Healthy Brain
Network (HBN) study (Alexander et al. 2017) also adopted the new MPRAGE+PMC sequence,
while also maintaining the HCP style MPRAGE sequence due to concerns regarding
reproducibility across sequences. The original HCP study (HCP-YA) is a project that has already
concluded its data acquisition, but the study is now being expanded through the HCP Lifespan
Studies. The Lifespan Studies have all converted to also collect structural imaging with the
MPRAGE+PMC protocol. This includes the HCP Aging (HCP-A) (Susan Y. Bookheimer et al.
2019) for ages 36-100+ years old, the HCP Development (HCP-D) (Somerville et al. 2018) for
ages 5-21 years old, and the Lifespan Baby Connectome Project (BCP) for children aged 0-5
years old (Howell et al. 2019). See Table 1 for details regarding T1-weighted structural sequences
used in large neuroimaging studies.

Network (HBN) **

Table 1. T1-weighted structural imaging parameters across large imaging studies. Only reporting
imaging sequences performed on 3T Siemens MRIs.
* We were unable to find all the sequence parameters for the BCP. However, the researchers of
BCP state they attempt to match as much as possible the imaging parameters of the other HCP
studies (Howell et al. 2019).
** For the HBN study, currently only one of the imaging sites (Citigroup Biomedical Imaging Center
- CBIC) is collecting two structural scans for all subjects.
Given that new large imaging studies (i.e. HCP Lifespan and ABCD) are using the
MPRAGE+PMC sequence to collect their structural data, we raise a key question, should other
researchers switch from the well-established MPRAGE sequence to the MPRAGE+PMC
sequence? In this study, we present quantifiable similarities and differences between the HCP
style MPRAGE to the ABCD style MPRAGE+PMC sequence to address the previous question.
Methods
Neuroimaging Data
All neuroimaging data used in this study were collected as part of the Healthy Brain
Network (HBM) Project (Alexander et al. 2017) and were acquired on a Siemens Prisma Fit with
a 32 channel head coil located at the Citigroup Biomedical Imaging Center (CBIC) at Weill Cornell
Medicine. A total of 465 imaging sessions were analyzed. Of these 465 participants, 348
completed the full HBN MRI protocol and are included in this study, with an age range of 5 to 21
years old (mean=11.3±3.6) which included 120 females and 228 males. The HBN protocol at
CBIC includes two structural T1-weighted sequences, one based on the Human Connectome
Project-YA (here referred to as the “MPRAGE” sequence), and another based on the ABCD study
with the MPRAGE sequence with PMC (here referred to as the “MPRAGE+PMC” sequence).
Another set of participants (N=71) performed a test-retest protocol (Test-Retest Group).
As part of the protocol specifically designed for this study, these participants performed two
MPRAGE scans and two MPRAGE+PMC scans within the same imaging session. Specifically,
one MPRAGE+PMC (MPRAGE+PMC1) and then one MPRAGE (MPRAGE1) sequence were
performed at the beginning of the imaging session and the other two sequences were repeated
at the end of the imaging session (MPRAGE2 and then MPRAGE+PMC2). This strategy was
chosen since a larger amount of head motion is expected on the runs at the end of a session.
The test-retest group had an age range of 5 to 20 years old (mean=11.6±3.7) with 23 females
and 42 males. The HBN protocol and timing of the sequences for both groups are provided in
Supplementary Tables 1 (ST1) and 2 (ST2).

Imaging Parameters
The MR Protocol Guidance from the Human Connectome Project (Glasser et al. 2016)
was followed to define the 3D MPRAGE HCP style imaging sequence. For the structural
sequences with the navigators (MPRAGE+PMC), we used the protocol from the ABCD study
(Casey et al. 2018). The imaging sequence protocol parameters used in this study are shown in
Table 1. Additionally, for the MPRAGE+PMC sequence, we configured the sequence with a
reacquisition threshold of 0.5 (see equation [3] in (Tisdall et al. 2012)) and up to 24 TRs could be
remeasured. The MPRAGE sequence had a duration of 7 minutes and 19 seconds, while the
MPRAGE+PMC can take up to 7 minutes and 12 seconds to be acquired. During the structural
runs, the participants were shown the Inscapes Movie (Vanderwal et al. 2015), a video developed
to improve compliance related to motion and wakefulness.
Structural Quantitative Measurements
We extracted morphometry measurements from the images using Mindboggle (Klein et
al. 2017). Within Mindboggle, Freesurfer (Fischl 2012) measures were also extracted. For each
Freesurfer label, measurements included volume, area, median travel and geodesic depth, and
the median measurement of Freesurfer’s cortical thickness, curvature, and convexity of the sulcus
(Fischl 2012). Geodesic depth is the shortest distance along the surface of the brain from the
point to where the brain surface makes contact with the outer reference surface (Klein et al. 2017),
whereas travel depth is the shortest distance from a point to the outer reference surface without
penetrating any surface (Giard et al. 2011; Klein et al. 2017). Total gray matter volume across
different structural runs was also measured with FSL’s SIENAX (Smith et al. 2002) package, in
addition to the results obtained through Mindboggle.
Reliability
Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC(3,1)) was used to calculate the reliability of the
morphometric measures (Shrout and Fleiss 1979). Inter-sequence reliability was measured
between the different imaging sequences, MPRAGE and MPRAGE+PMC. Intra-sequence
reliability was measured across different imaging runs for the same pulse sequence.
Age-Related Changes
We estimated age-related changes to compare the two imaging sequences. Age-related
curves were separated by sex and by the quantity of motion during the functional sequences.
Quality Control
Six measures of quality control for the structural images were performed by using the
Quality Assessment Protocol (QAP) toolbox (Zarrar et al. 2015). Specificall, for each subject and
structural image the following quality control scores measures were calculated:
●
Contrast to Noise Ratio (CNR): measures the mean of the gray matter intensity values minus
the mean of the white matter intensity values divided by the standard deviation of the values
outside the brain) (Magnotta, Friedman, and FIRST BIRN 2006);
●
Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR): measures the mean intensity within the gray matter divided by
the standard deviation of the values outside the brain)(Magnotta, Friedman, and FIRST
BIRN 2006);

●

Foreground to Background Energy Ratio (FBER): measures the variance of voxels inside
the brain divided by the variance of voxels outside the brain;
●
Percent Artifact Voxels (PAV): measures the proportion of voxels outside the brain with
artifacts to the total number of voxels outside the brain (Mortamet et al. 2009);
●
Smoothness of Voxels (FWHM) measures the full-width half maximum of the spatial
distribution of the image intensity values in voxel units (Magnotta, Friedman, and FIRST
BIRN 2006);
●
Entropy Focus Criterion (EFC), measures the Shannon entropy of voxel intensities
proportional to the maximum possible entropy for a similarly sized image; Indicates ghosting
and head motion-induced blurring) (Atkinson et al. 1997).
For the CNR, SNR, and FBER, a higher score means a better image, while for the FWHM, PAV,
and EFC, a lower score is better.
An additional quality control measurement was also performed that is not part of the QAP
package. Specifically, we compared the background noise in two regions around the brain. One
12mm radius circle located in front of the forehead immediately above the eyeball (Anterior ROI),
and another above the head (Superior ROI) (See Supplementary Figure SF1 for the location of
the circles). We then calculated the ratio of the average signal from the Anterior divided the
Superior region of interest, hence Anterior-to-Superior Ratio (ASR). For ASR, a lower score is
better.
Motion estimation
EPI volumetric navigators with an 8mm isotropic resolution are collected with the
MPRAGE+PMC pulse sequence. These volumes are used as navigators to estimate the head
motion during the scan, and one three dimensional volume is acquired at each TR. For the HBN
study, the total number of volumes that were acquired at each MPRAGE+PMC sequence range
from 143 to 168, depending on the number of TRs that need to be reacquired based on subject
motion (Tisdall et al. 2012). For each MPRAGE+PMC run, the framewise displacement (FD)
(Jenkinson et al. 2002) was calculated with these EPI volumes. The FD was then converted to
FD per minute (FDpm) by (Tisdall et al. 2012):

where N is the number of TRs, TR is the repetition time in seconds, i is the volume, and FD(i-1,i)
is the FD between two subsequent volumes.
With the MPRAGE sequence, we cannot directly estimate motion, hence we investigated
if the average motion across all functional scans can be used as a proxy for how much a
participant moves during a structural scan. Specifically, the average FDpm for all functional MRI
scans of the protocol were also calculated and compared.
Results
How do the sequences compare by visual inspection?
By visual inspection, there were some key differences in image intensity and quality when
comparing the MPRAGE and MPRAGE+PMC sequences (Figure 1). For the purposes of
demonstration, through visual inspection of the structural images, we identified two participants,

one with a low amount of motion (Non-Mover) and one with a high amount of motion (Mover). For
the participant data on the left (Non-Mover), visually, the images appear to be of excellent quality
for both the MPRAGE and MPRAGE+PMC sequences. This subject had a low amount of motion
during the data collection of the MPRAGE+PMC sequence (FDpm = 6.04 during MPRAGE+PMC
sequence). For the functional scans of the protocol, the same participant has a low FDpm = 7.24
(see Motion Estimation section below on how head motion was estimated for the MPRAGE runs).
The images on the right represent a participant with a large amount of motion for the MPRAGE
and MPRAGE+PMC sequence. Even though there was a large amount of head motion during the
acquisition in the MPRAGE+PMC sequence (FDpm = 62.23 during MPRAGE+PMC sequence;
average FDpm=17.41 during functional scans), the quality of the T1’s is still sufficient for many
applications. That is not the case for the MPRAGE images, where the ringing artifacts are
strikingly pronounced and this data would have to be discarded for any neuroimaging study.
However. it is important to note that for the MPRAGE+PMC image, the gray-white matter
boundaries are not as sharp as the low motion subject. There are also some ringing artifacts
present in the MPRAGE+PMC image. Hence, the MPRAGE+PMC image is not completely
immune to head motion, as seen in Figure 1 and also in Supplementary Figure SF2.

Does the Surface Reconstruction Complete?
A first simple, however very practical, comparison of these two sequences is to test
whether Mindboggle was able to complete processing the surface reconstruction. With images of
poor quality, such as the one seen for the “Mover” subject in the MPRAGE sequence (Figure 1),
the software does not complete and returns an error instead of the morphometry measurements.
For the large group, a total of 346 participants completed both the MPRAGE and
MPRAGE+PMC sequences. Of the 346 images, Mindboggle successfully completed surface
reconstruction in 89.3% (N=309) of the MPRAGE images and 91.6% (N=317) of the
MPRAGE+PMC images. Using McNemar’s test (McNEMAR 1947), no statistically significant
differences (p>0.1) were found between completing the processing of the images for the different
sequences. We visually inspected the 31 images from the MPRAGE+PMC images that did not
complete surface reconstruction and all looked blurry (see examples in Supplementary Figure
SF2). The average motion from the EPI navigators of the MPRAGE+PMC sequences was then
calculated. For the images that completed the surface reconstruction, there was an FDpm = 13.70
+- 12.85, while for the images that were not completed the motion was much higher, with an FDpm
= 47.56 +- 37.32. For the subsequent analysis shown in this manuscript that depend on the
surface reconstruction results, only the data from participants that Mindboggle was able to
complete processing both images are used. Therefore, 290 subjects (105 females, mean age =
11.20 +- 3.66, age range = [5.44, 20.47]) are included in the following analyses that depend on
surface reconstruction estimates. Hence, the following results that are presented only use data
that has already passed through a first level of quality control, i.e. completing surface
reconstruction.
For the test-retest group, we performed the same type of quality control analysis, but now
with sequences that were collected closely within the session, with the MPRAGE1 and
MPRAGE+PMC1 at the beginning of the session and MPRAGE2 and MPRAGE+PMC2 at the
end. Of the 72 participants that completed all four runs, Mindboggle completed processing on
94.5% (N=68) of the MPRAGE1, 98.6% (M=71) of the MPRAGE+PMC1, 97.2.6% (N=70) of the
MPRAGE2, and 97.2% (N=70) of the MPRAGE+PMC2. Again, using McNemar’s test we found
no statistically significant differences (p>0.1) between the sequences regarding Mindboggle
completing the processing of the images. Mindboggle was able to calculate morphometric
measurements in all 4 structural runs for 65 participants. These participants are used in the
reliability tests shown below.
Reliability
Intra- and inter-sequence reliability results for the Mindboggle measurements are shown
in Figure 2. ICC scores are shown for each of 62 cortical regions defined by Freesurfer (list of
regions can be seen in supplementary table ST3) and for the following measurements, (1) area,
(2) Freesurfer median cortical thickness, (3) travel depth, (4) geodesic distance, (5) curvature,
and (6) convexity. The first row shows results for all participants. They were then divided into two
groups, through a median split of the mean FDpm of the functional scans. The Intra-sequence
reliability of cortical measures extracted from the MPRAGE+PMC sequences was better for all of
the regions and measures compared to the MPRAGE pair. This is possibly due to a higher motion
during the MPRAGE2 scan, which was collected at the end of the session. Another noticeable
result is that even for the low motion subjects, the ICC was higher for the MPRAGE1 x

MPRAGE+PMC1 pair (inter-sequence) compared to the MPRAGE1 x MPRAGE2 pair (intrasequence). Again, this is possibly due to the higher motion in the MPRAGE2 runs, even though
these were the subjects with lower motion estimation scores. Also, from the same reproducibility
results it is important to notice that even though the voxel sizes are of different sizes for the
MPRAGE (0.512mm3) and MPRAGE+PMC (1mm3) sequences, the ICC scores between
MPRAGE1 and MPRAGE+PMC1 are higher than repeating the MPRAGE sequence.

median cortical thickness, (3) travel depth, (4) geodesic distance, (5) curvature, and (6) convexity.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Histogram plots of ICC for the area, volume, and Freesurfer median cortical thickness
across all brain regions are shown in Figure 3. As can be seen in the histograms, the pair
MPRAGE+PMC1 x MPRAGE+PMC2 (orange line) outperformed the ICC scores of all other pairs.
It is clear that the reproducibility between MPRAGE+PMC1 and MPRAGE+PMC2 is high, with an
average ICC score above 0.8 for Area and Volume and above 0.6 for cortical thickness. The pair
MPRAGE1 x MPRAGE+PMC1 (green line) typically showed the second-best performance. The
lower ICC scores in the low-motion and high-motion subjects for any pair that contains the
MPRAGE2 run (blue, purple, and brown lines) is highly observable, especially for Area. The
MPRAGE+PMC2 run is also performed at the end of the session, however contrary to MPRAGE
sequence, and we can directly measure the amount of motion during that run. During the
MPRAGE+PMC2 run, on average, there is at least twice the amount of head motion (FDpm = 7.5
for MPRAGE+PMC1 and FDpm = 15.34 for MPRAGE+PMC2). Also, when considering the pairs
that contain the MPRAGE2 run, there is a large negative shift in ICC scores when comparing the
“Low-Motion” and “High-Motion” subjects. With the other pairs, there is also a negative shift in

ICC scores, but at a much smaller scale. These results corroborate with the notion that the
MPRAGE+PMC is more robust to motion compared to the sequence without PMC.
ICC of Cortical Thickness was worse for all pairs compared to Area and Volume. This
shows how sensitive the measurement of Cortical Thickness is, especially in regard to head
motion. The improvement in ICC for the MPRAGE+PMC pair over the MPRAGE pair was
unanticipated for the low motion group, given that the MPRAGE sequence has a better spatial
resolution, which is expected to obtain better cortical thickness estimation results. Another key
result from the “ideal” low motion group, is that the inter-sequence pairs MPRAGE1MPRAGE+PMC1 (green line) and MPRAGE1-MPRAGE+PMC2 (red line) show higher reliability
than the intra-sequence pair MPRAGE1-2 (blue line) for all the three measures being evaluated.

for each combination by calculating the absolute difference in volume measures.
MPRAGE+PMC1 and MPRAGE+PMC2 had the most similar gray matter volumes for both
toolboxes. The largest differences were observed in the pairs that included the MPRAGE2 image.
These results indicate that the prospective motion correction sequence is robust for measuring
gray matter volume regardless of the toolbox used to calculate volumes. It also endorses the
assumption that the MPRAGE+PMC sequence provides us more reliable results compared to
MPRAGE, independent on when the structural sequence is performed within the session,
beginning or end.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------How does Motion Affect Structural Measurements Between Sequences?
With the larger dataset, we performed an analysis to investigate if the differences in
measurements of cortical thickness are affected by head motion. For each region, a correlation
was calculated between the difference in cortical thickness measured with the MPRAGE and
MPRAGE+PMC images (MPRAGE - MPRAGE+PMC) and the mean FDpm across the functional
scans. For males, 26 regions showed a statistically significant correlation (p<0.05) of the
difference in cortical thickness measurements and head motion. The grand majority of these
regions, especially in the frontal lobe, showed a negative correlation (n=24). There were two areas
in the occipital lobe that show a positive correlation. These results indicate that, as there was an
increase in subject head motion, the difference in the measurement of cortical thickness between
MPRAGE and MPRAGE+PMC increases, with a larger cortical thickness estimate with the
MPRAGE+PMC sequence in 24 areas (see Figure 5, Supplementary Table ST3 for list of regions,
and scatter plots are shown in Supplementary Figures SF3 and SF4). For females, 31 regions
showed a significant negative correlation between the difference in cortical thickness and motion
estimation. No areas showed a positive correlation for females.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------We also calculated pairwise t-tests to compare the cortical thickness measurements
between MPRAGE and MPRAGE+PMC in the 62 cortical regions defined by Freesurfer. For
males, there was a significant difference (p<0.05) in 38 of the 62 regions. Of the 38, 27 showed
a larger cortical thickness for MPRAGE and 11 for MPRAGE+PMC (Supplementary Figure SF5).
For females, 38 regions also presented differences in cortical thickness measurements, with 29
showing greater cortical thickness for MPRAGE and 9 for MPRAGE+PMC (Supplementary Figure
SF5). Statistical scores for all the regions are shown in Supplementary Table ST4.
Age-Related Differences
Figure 6 shows development curves for total volume, gray and white matter volume, and
ventricle volume for male and female participants. Only a smaller subset of subjects (N=248, 92
females) was used to calculate the development curves since there were very few subjects older
than 16 to obtain adequate development estimation curves at higher ages. Hence, development
curves are shown only for ages 6 to 16. Black dots represent volumes calculated with the
MPRAGE sequence while red dots represent the MPRAGE+PMC sequence. For each sequence,
a quadratic curve was fit for estimating development growth. For the “All Subjects” the
development graphs are similar for both imaging sequences. With a median split, participants
were grouped by low and high motion. Even for the subjects with large motion, the development
curves are similar, just deviating at the higher ages for both groups. This deviation in curvature is
possibly due to the low number of subjects that are older with a higher amount of motion. The
development curves are shown for cortical thickness measurements for males and females are
shown in Supplementary Figures SF6 and SF7, respectively.

the MPRAGE sequence, while the red dots and lines are for the MPRAGE+PMC sequence.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Quality Control Metrics
The MPRAGE+PMC sequence is identical to the MPRAGE sequence, except for the
inclusion of a navigator acquisition and registration block, lasting 355 milliseconds, during the
inversion recovery time and just before the parent sequence’s readout (Tisdall et al. 2012). In
previous comparisons between these sequences, the MPRAGE+PMC sequence resulted in an
approximately 1% reduction in contrast and a 3% reduction in image intensities (Tisdall et al.
2012). Importantly, these reductions were spatially uniform, so did not increase regional variation
in image intensity (e.g., the ‘bias’ field). The MPRAGE+PMC sequence has been shown to result
in more artifacts, such as ghosting, in the background, but since they did not overlap with the
brain, they were not considered problematic (Tisdall et al. 2012).
In our study, acquisition parameters were identical between sequences, with the exception
of voxel resolution, bandwidth, and partial Fourier. These differences are a consequence of
MPRAGE+PMC’s navigate and register block reducing the amount of time available for parent
sequence readout. From MRI theory, SNR is proportional to voxel volume (V) and inversely
proportional to the square root of bandwidth (BW) and the square root of the partial Fourier
reduction factor (R). The relative SNR from the MPRAGE+PMC sequence to the MPRAGE
sequence can be calculated by:

aCC-BY-NC 4.0 International license.

From these relationships, the SNR of the MPRAGE+PMC sequence is expected to be about 1.54
times greater than the SNR of the MPRAGE sequence (Craddock et al. 2013; Brown et al. 2014).
Figure 7 and shows the QAP quality control metrics for the 348 participants. Quality control
metrics for the test-retest group are shown in Supplementary Figure SF8. Paired t-test were
calculated at each measure to statistically compare sequences. Results showed significant
differences (p<0.05) for all measures and are shown in Table 2. When comparing MPRAGE and
MPRAGE+PMC, MPRAGE+PMC had a better score for CNR and ASR. MPRAGE exhibited a
better score in all the other measures.
These results are a bit unexpected, especially for SNR, since theoretically the
MPRAGE+PMC sequence should have an SNR 1.54 times greater than MPRAGE. Tisdal et. al
(Tisdall et al. 2012) reported that the MPRAGE+PMC images had an increased ghosting effect
that was only observed in the background. We are calculating SNR of each image by measuring
the mean intensity within the gray matter and dividing by the standard deviation of the voxels
outside of the brain. The increase in ghosting artifacts in the background would justify the
reduction in SNR for the MPRAGE+PMC images. The same holds for justifying the inferior scores
for MPRAGE+PMC in FBER, PAV, and EFC, which all depend on the background signal to
calculate their metrics. The larger receive bandwidth (RBW) of the MPRAGE+PMC sequence
(240 kHz) compared to the RBW of the MPRAGE (130 kHz) might justify the increase in
background noise, since a larger RBW lets in more noise in the echo. The lower FWHM scores
for the MPRAGE image are due to smaller voxel sizes compared to the MPRAGE+PMC image.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Motion Estimation
Head motion occurring during fMRI scans has been proposed as a surrogate for sMRI
motion when no other method for estimating motion from the data exists (Pardoe, Kucharsky
Hiess, and Kuzniecky 2016). The potential accuracy of fMRI as a surrogate of sMRI motion is
supported by observations of high test-retest reliability for motion parameters across scans and
sessions (Yan et al. 2013). But, fatigue, discomfort and other factors are known to increase motion
over time, which will likely degrade the surrogate’s accuracy. We directly tested the validity of
using fMRI motion as a surrogate for sMRI motion by correlating sMRI motion estimates from the
MPRAGE+PMC sequence with motion from each of the fMRI scans collected in the same session
with the test-retest dataset (see Supplementary Tables ST1 and ST2 and Alexander (Alexander
et al. 2017) for details on the full imaging session.). We additionally tested how well the average
motion across all fMRI scans correlates with the motion calculated in the MPRAGE+PMC run
(Figure 8). In Figure 8 runs are listed in the order that there were collected.
The leftmost column of Figure 8 shows the average FDpm. As expected, there is a tendency
for an increase in head motion as the session prolonged. There were two runs that were repeated

in the first half and in the second half of the session, MPRAGE+PMC1-2 and peer1-33. For the
MPRAGE+PMC runs, there was an increase in average FDpm from 7.50 to 15.34 for
MPRAGE+PMC1 and MPRAGE+PMC2 respectively. A large increase in motion also occurs for
the peer runs, from 11.29 in peer1 to 17.43 in peer3. An exception to this increase in head motion
was MovieTP, which is a short animated and engaging movie (“The Present”), which could have
been the reason for lower head motion during that run.
Results indicate that runs which were collected close in time showed higher correlations
than runs that were collected farther apart. For example, rest1 has a much higher correlation with
peer1 in FDpm (r=0.79) which is collected immediately after rest1, than it did to movieTP (r=0.40)
which occurred at the very end of the scanning session. The exception to this order effect was
rest1 and movieDM, which were separated in time, with a correlation of r=0.80. The average FDpm
across the functional runs (“Mean”) exhibited a high correlation with all the runs, with values
ranging from r=[0.41, 0.83]. The correlation of FDpm with the two structural runs was r=0.41 and
r=0.7 for MPRAGE+PMC1 and MPRAGE+PMC2, respectively. Therefore, as previously
suggested, the mean FD across the functional scans is a decent surrogate measure for the head
motion for the structural scans (Pardoe, Kucharsky Hiess, and Kuzniecky 2016).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Discussion
The present study examined the relative advantages and interchangeability of the
traditional MPRAGE and MPRAGE+PMC pulse sequences. Intra-sequence reliabilities
demonstrated a clear advantage for the MPRAGE+PMC sequence in a hyperkinetic population,
largely due to the compromises in MPRAGE reliability among the higher movers. Inter-sequence
reliabilities among low-motion participants demonstrated a high comparability for the assessment
of individual differences, suggesting the potential to change sequences mid-study when possible.

In comparison to other studies that directly contrast the MPRAGE and MPRAGE+PMC
sequences in a controlled environment, we tested the MPRAGE+PMC sequence in a “real world”
scenario, where we did not explicitly ask subjects to move or maintain still during the acquisition
of the structural images (Tisdall et al. 2016). All subjects were requested to maintain their head
as still as possible throughout the imaging session.
Advantages and Disadvantages
Intra-sequence reliability scores of the two sequences revealed a clear superiority of the
newer pulse sequence (MPRAGE-PMC). This was demonstrated across the broad range of
morphometric measurements tested. This higher robustness to head motion observed for the
MPRAGE-PMC sequence is not only due to the adaptation of the gradients to motion, but the
acquisition of TRs with large displacement, which is a novel feature about this sequence (Tisdall
et al. 2012) compared to other PMC sequences. Being able to directly estimate head motion
though the navigators is also an advantage of the MPRAGE+PMC sequence. These motion
measurements can be used post-hoc as a covariate in a statistical analysis or as a proxy on
deciding to use or not the structural images.
It is worth noting that not all measurements favored the sequence with PMC. As observed
with the quality control indexes, there is a decrease in signal quality in the of the MPRAGE+PMC
compared to MPRAGE. The MPRAGE sequence is superior to the MPRAGE+PMC sequence in
5 out of the 7 quality control measurements. Nonetheless, most of the measures in which the
MPRAGE sequence is superior depends on the level of noise in the background, which in most
part do not affect brain segmentation algorithms (i.e. Freesurfer, Mindboggle, Siena). The CNR,
in which MPRAGE+PMC is superior, actually can be considered the most crucial quality control
metric (calculates the contrast between the gray matter and the white matter intensities). This
contrast is essential for accurately finding the gray matter - white matter boundary, which is
imperative for performing segmentation of brain areas/volumes and measuring cortical thickness.
Should researchers switch sequences?
Inter-sequence reliability scores showed excellent mean ICC scores (>0.8) for the majority
of the morphometric measures tested. The only exception is cortical thickness, which showed a
mean ICC score of 0.512 between MPRAGE1 and MPRAGE+PMC1, showing a higher sensitivity
of cortical thickness measurement to motion (Reuter et al. 2015). Consistent with this point, our
results show a higher inter-sequence reliability (MPRAGE1 x MPRAGE+PMC1) than intrasequence reliability of the more traditional sequence (MPRAGE1 x MPRAGE2) in all the
morphometric measures. As expected, inter- and intra-sequence reliability is higher for lower
motion subjects compared to the higher motion subjects. Analogous results between the two
sequences were also obtained for the development curves. This further corroborates with the
notion that brain quantitative measures obtained in the different sequences are more equivalent
then different.
Taking into account all considerations, we recommend that researchers: 1) use
MPRAGE+PMC as their structural T1 weighted pulse imaging sequence for future studies, and
2) consider switching to the MPRAGE+PMC for ongoing studies. While the first recommendation
is relatively obvious given our findings that there are higher intra-sequence reliability scores for
the MPRAGE+PMC pair (MPRAGE+PMC1 x MPRAGE+PMC1) compared to all other pair of
21

sequences. In contrast, the second recommendation may be somewhat surprising to some;
however, it reflects our findings of high inter-sequence reliability, especially in the MPRAGE1 x
MPRAGE-PMC1 pair. The immediate switch to MPRAGE+PMC sequence is likely most important
to studies dealing with hyperkinetic populations, where findings are increasingly being questioned
due to associations with head motion (Reuter et al. 2015; Alexander-Bloch et al. 2016; Pardoe,
Kucharsky Hiess, and Kuzniecky 2016). Neuroimaging researchers with projects studying low
head motion participants may very well consider staying with the MPRAGE sequence, possibly
finding some advantage given the higher quality control measures.
Beyond the quality control metrics, the only downside that we can identify for adopting the
MPRAGE-PMC sequence is the potential increase in acquisition time. However, this increase in
acquisition time is mostly due to the repetition of TRs that surpass a motion threshold. If you are
studying a population with high motion, on average this is actually an overall reduction in scan
time, especially if researchers are considering repeating a full acquisition for high movers. The
HBN initiative with children adopted a maximum repeat of 24 TRs. If time is of the essence and
the study is with a low moving population, the maximum number of repeated TRs can be reduced
to save scanner time.
It is important to note that the MPRAGE+PMC sequence is not entirely immune to head
motion and other measures to restrain motion should be used in conjunction with this new
sequence. Fortunately, the PMC pulse sequences can be used in conjunction with other
strategies for minimizing head movements, such as training the subject in a mock scanner to get
acclimated to the environment (de Bie et al. 2010), movie watching to reduce motion (Vanderwal
et al. 2015; Greene et al. 2018), and other methods such as using customized head restraints
have also been proposed (Power et al. 2019). Additionally, methods that quickly quantify the
quality of the structural images have also been proposed (T. White et al. 2018), hence if
necessary, a structural scan can quickly be repeated within the same session.
Limitations
This study is limited in the sense that we do not have a direct measurement for motion
during the MPRAGE sequence. However, we have attempted to estimate the motion by using the
average motion across the functional runs. We have also not performed any rigorous visual
inspection (Iscan et al. 2015) or post-processing quality control on the morphometric
measurements (Ducharme et al. 2016). We did not want to discard any data due to poor image
quality through visual inspection, hence directly comparing the two sequences. As can be seen
in Figure 1, though a visual inspection for the high motion participant, we would probably discard
the MPRAGE image but not the MPRAGE+PMC image. Another limitation of this study is that the
voxel size of the sequences that we are testing have different sizes. However, the objective of
this paper is to compare two T1-weighted MRI sequences that are used by a broad number of
researchers and by large imaging studies, such as the ABCD study and HCP. Nevertheless, even
with different voxel sizes our results showed a high reliability between the two sequences. Finally,
we did not perform any statistical corrections for multiple comparisons in any of our tests. The
objective of this paper was to uncover if the two sequences are equivalent, not find the differences.
Therefore, by using any form of correction for multiple comparisons for our statistical tests would
becloud our results.

Conclusions
Our results indicate that researchers should adopt or switch to the MPRAGE+PMC
sequence in their new studies, especially if there are studying populations with high levels of head
motion. Morphometric results obtained from the MPRAGE+PMC sequences are comparable to
MPRAGE, especially with the low motion images. Hence, there is no loss if a research would
choose to switch from MPRAGE to MPRAGE+PMC. Additionally, our data from a developmental
study, shows that T1’s obtained with PMC have a much higher reliability compared to the
traditional MPRAGE sequence. However, quality control metrics have shown higher scores for
MPRAGE compared to MPRAGE+PMC, mostly due to increased background noise in the
MPRAGE+PMC sequence. Hence, if the population that is being studied has minimal head motion
and the researcher would like to maximize data quality (i.e. SNR), the MPRAGE sequence might
be preferred.
