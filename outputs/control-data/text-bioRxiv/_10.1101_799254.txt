Abstract

63

1. The ectomycorrhizal death cap Amanita phalloides is native to Europe but invasive in

64

North America. To understand whether the fungus spreads underground using hyphae, or above

65

ground using sexual spores, we mapped and genotyped sporocarps from European and American

66

populations. Larger genetic individuals (genets) would suggest spread mediated by vegetative

67

growth, while many small genets would suggest dispersal mediated by spores. To test whether

68

genets are ephemeral or persistent, we also sampled from the same invasive populations over

69

time.

70

2. We mapped 13 European and American populations between 2004-2007 and characterized

71

each using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP). In 2014 and 2015, we resampled

72

populations in California and added three new European populations. These populations and a

73

subset of the specimens originally collected in 2004 were characterized using whole genome

74

sequencing.

75

3. In every population and across all time points, sporocarps resolve into small, apparently

76

short-lived genets. Sporocarps nearer each other are more closely related, suggesting spores land

77

and germinate near parent sporocarps.

78

4. A. phalloides uses spores to move across landscapes. Spores travel very short distances

79

and individuals appear ephemeral. The death cap’s life history suggests yearly sporocarp

80

removal as a strategy for control of this deadly fungus.

Introduction

94

Invasions drive global change (Vitousek et al., 1997; Dukes & Mooney 1999; Ravi et al.,

95

2009) but invasion biology often focuses on plants and animals in isolation (Shea & Chesson

96

2002), ignoring the role mutualists may play in invasion dynamics. Mutualist ectomycorrhizal

97

(ECM) fungi provide resources to plants in exchange for photosynthetically derived carbon

98

(Smith & Read, 2008), and consequently introduced or invasive ECM fungi impact local

99

ecosystems (Litchman 2010). But while the mechanisms enabling the spread of invasive plants,

100

and the roles of ECM in facilitating plant invasions, are increasingly documented (Welk et al.,

101

2002; Williams et al., 2005; Barker et al., 2017), the mechanisms enabling the spread of invasive

102

ECM fungi in association with native plants are scarcely explored (Desprez-Loustau et al., 2007,

103

but see Nuñez et al., 2013).

104

Although invasions by plants are often mediated by symbiotic associations with introduced

105

or invasive ECM fungi (and vice versa; Richardson et al., 2000; Hayward et al., 2015; Teste et

106

al., 2019), introduced ECM fungi can also invade independently of introduced or invasive plants

107

(Díez et al., 2005; Pringle et al., 2009; Berch et al., 2016; Vargas et al., 2019). A fungus

108

invading on its own is likely to have an invasion dynamic distinct from a fungus associating with

109

an invasive plant (Dickie et al. 2017). However data tracking ECM invasions are limited, as are

110

data describing potential impacts. Open questions include whether these fungi persist as

111

mutualists, behave as parasites, or displace native ECM species (Chapela et al., 2001; Vellinga et

112

al., 2009).

113

The death cap Amanita phalloides is an invasive ECM fungus spreading through the endemic

114

coastal live oak woodlands of California (Pringle & Vellinga, 2006, Pringle et al., 2009, Wolfe et

115

al., 2010, Wolfe & Pringle 2011). Native to Europe, it now grows across the Southern

116

Hemisphere, but its invasion dynamic is best described in North America, and specifically in the

117

United States. The fungus first appeared in California and the Northeast U.S. in the mid-20th

118

century (Pringle et al., 2009), and it has since spread through California and north into

119

Washington and British Columbia (Ammirati et al., 1977; Pringle et al., 2009; Berch et al.,

120

2016). In contrast, populations on the East Coast appear confined within initial points of

121

introduction, despite nearly 50 years of monitoring (Tanghe & Simons 1973; Tanghe, 1983;

122

Pringle & Vellinga, 2006).

123

While the death cap is clearly invading California, how it spreads is unknown. Fungi

124

reproduce and disperse using vegetative fragments or spores (sexual or asexual). At one time

125

spores were assumed to mediate dispersal across continents and oceans (Peay et al., 2010; Golan

126

& Pringle 2017), but recent data suggest the sexual spores of many mushroom forming

127

Basidiomycete fungi fall just next to parent sporocarps (Galante et al. 2011; Peay & Bruns

128

2014). Steady vegetative growth can result in enormous mycelia (e.g., Armillaria spp.), but

129

whether fragmentation enables colonization of empty habitats is often unclear (Smith et al.,

130

1992; Anderson et al., 2018).

131

Directly observing the dispersal of fungi in nature is challenging. Spores are difficult to track

132

and often, vegetative mycelia are hidden in substrates. But dispersal can be inferred by extending

133

the concept of a genetic individual, or genet (c.f. Harper, 1977; a term originally developed by

134

plant demographers) to include fungi. In the context of A. phalloides, we define a genet as the

135

body (or mycelium) generated by the fusion of two germinating, haploid (or monokaryotic)

136

spores, and assume the diploid body (or the dikaryon) is the dominant phase of the life cycle

137

(Rayner, 1991; Dahlberg & Stenlid, 1994; Anderson & Kohn, 1995; Booth 2014). Vegetative

138

growth would result in large genets, while frequent colonization by sexual spores would result in

139

many small genets (Dahlberg & Stenlid, 1994). Practically, genet size is measured by genotyping

140

sporocarps. Many genetically identical sporocarps scattered across a habitat characterize large

141

genets; distances among genetically identical sporocarps define the size of the genet. Genets of

142

other ECM species range from centimeters to hundreds of meters (Gryta et al., 1997; Redecker et

143

al., 2001; Sawyer et al., 2001; Bergemann et al., 2002; Dunham et al., 2003; Lian et al., 2006;

144

Rubini et al., 2011), and like these fungi, A. phalloides may propagate using either fragments or

145

spores, or both.

146

By physically mapping and genotyping sporocarps from multiple populations in European

147

and American forests, and from the same Californian sites over time, we generated data on genet

148

size to ask 1) does the death cap establish across landscapes using vegetative hyphae or sexual

149

spores, 2) can the same individuals persist in a population over time, and 3) does genet size differ

150

between native and invasive ranges?

Materials and Methods
Collections and Mapping
Sporocarps of A. phalloides were collected from populations throughout Europe and the

157

United States (Fig. 1, Table 1, Supporting Information Table S1a,b). We define a population as a

158

group of sporocarps occurring within an area no larger than 75m by 75m. Most populations are

159

kilometers away from each other (Fig. 1), but at Point Reyes National Seashore (PRNS) in

160

California, individuals are continuously distributed along Limantour Road. Populations from

161

PRNS were delineated arbitrarily by walking across the road or at least 75m away before

162

collecting and naming a distinct population (Wolfe & Pringle, 2011). Global Position System

163

(GPS) coordinates were recorded for each location within 5 m of accuracy (Table 1). Due to

164

small-scale GPS inacuracies, we are unable to overlay the spatial maps of sporocarps from

165

different years (when we sampled over time at a single site).

166

The majority of sporocarps were collected from forests dominated by native species of

167

Fagaceae and Pinaceae. Populations from the former Centre d’Ecologie des Système Aquatiques

168

Continentaux (CESAC) surrounded a planted Cedrus libani on what is now the Marvig campus

169

of the CNRS Institute and Toulouse III University, and the population from the Escola Superior

170

Agrária de Coimbra was collected from a disturbed site on the Polytechnical Institute of Coimbra

171

campus. In New Jersey, A. phalloides grows in planted forests of native Pinus strobus (Wolfe et

172

al., 2010; Wolfe & Pringle, 2011), and in Rochester, NY, in a municipal park with Pinus strobus,

173

P. resinosa, Tsuga canadiensis, and Betula spp. In California, A. phalloides were collected from

174

relatively undisturbed coast live oak woodlands in association with Quercus agrifolia (Wolfe &

175

Pringle, 2011).

176

Every sporocarp in a population consisting of more than two sporocarps was carefully

177

mapped using one of three mapping methods depending on the tools available at each site. A full

178

description of each mapping method can be found in Supporting Information Methods S1.

179
180
181

DNA extraction and sequencing
Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) data were generated between 2005 and

182

2007 from a total of 221 sporocarps, and genome sequence data were generated between 2015

183

and 2016 from a total of 86 sporocarps (Table 1). Approximately 50 mg of cap tissue from each

184

sporocarp was placed in a 2.0 ml microcentrifuge tube with four to five 3 mm glass beads, and

185

macerated using a MiniBeadbeater-8 (BioSpec Products Inc., Bartlesville, OK) set at 75% speed

186

for one minute. For AFLP samples, genomic DNA was extracted from tissue using a Qiagen

187

DNeasy Tissue kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to manufacturer’s specifications. Any

188

extractions of low quality (as measured on a NanodropTM Spectrophotometer [NanoDrop

189

Technologies, Wilmington, DE]) were re-extracted. Extraction blanks were extracted along with

190

samples and used as a control to test for potential contamination.

191

For genome samples, 700 µl of CTAB buffer (2% CTAB, 2% PVP, 100 mM Tris-HCL [pH

192

8.0], 20 mM EDTA [pH 8.0], and 1.4 mM NaCl) was added after maceration, and samples were

193

left to incubate at 60ºC for one hour. Next, 700 µl of a 24:24:1, by volume, of a

194

phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol solution was added to each sample and samples were gently

195

mixed at room temperature for ten minutes, followed by centrifugation at room temperature at

196

13,000 rpm for ten minutes. The aqueous phase (~650-700 µl) of each sample was then carefully

197

transferred to a new 2.0 ml tube. 700 µl of the phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol solution was

198

again added to each sample, and samples were inverted and mixed at room temperature for ten

199

minutes, followed by centrifugation at room temperature at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, at which

200

point the aqueous phase was again transferred to a new 2.0 ml tube. Approximately 1,400 ml of

201

100% ethanol was added to each sample, and samples were incubated at -20ºC for 45 minutes,

202

and then centrifuged at 4ºC at 13,000 rpm for ten minutes. The supernatant was discarded, and

203

the pellet dried on a ThermoSci DNA SpeedVac at room temperature for ten minutes, or until

204

dry, and finally resuspended in 400 µl of 10 mM Tris-HCL (pH 8.0) and transferred to a new 1.5

205

ml tube. To further purify genomic DNA, 12 µl of RNase A (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was

206

added to each sample, and each sample incubated at 37ºC for one hour. 16 µl of 5 M NaCl and

207

860 µl of 100% ethanol were then added to each tube and the solution left to precipitate at -20ºC

208

for one hour, after which each tube was centrifuged at 4ºC at 13,000 rpm for 15 minutes and the

209

supernatant discarded. A final washing was performed with 500 µl of 75% ethanol; solutions

210

were centrifuged at 4ºC at 13,000 rpm for ten minutes and the supernatant discarded. Finally, the

211

resulting pellet was resuspended in 200 µl of 10mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). 5 ml of an Oxygen

212

AxyPrep Mag PCR Clean-Up kit (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburg, PA, USA) was used per

213

manufacturer instructions to remove any remaining impurities. DNA was stored at -80ºC until it

214

was provided to the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center.

216
217

Amplification and visualization of AFLP markers
The AFLP protocol is a DNA fingerprinting technique that does not require prior DNA

218

sequence information as it is based on a selective polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification

219

of adaptor-ligated restriction fragments formed from digested genomic DNA (Vos et al., 1995).

220

Mutations at restrictions sites result in the presence or absence of fragments of different sizes and

221

enable individuals to be distinguished from one another. AFLP data were generated for

222

sporocarps collected from 2004-2007, before genome data of A. phalloides were available, and at

223

the time AFLP was a genetic fingerprinting method of choice.

224

We adapted the AFLP protocol of the Applied Biosystems Microbial Fingerprinting Kit

225

(Applied Biosystems [ABI], Foster City, CA, USA) for use with our samples. Typically, ligated

226

fragments are amplified with increasingly selective primers in order to randomly subset the

227

number of fragments to a quantifiable number. But to generate consistent results, we first

228

amplified with no selective primers, and then proceeded to the +1 preselective (one additional

229

base pair on the primer) and +2 (two additional base pairs) selective amplifications. Moreover,

230

because A. phalloides has a smaller genome (~45 mb) than most organisms for which the ABI

231

AFLP kit is typically used, we modified the protocol to use less selective primers: we designed

232

+2 selective primers for the MseI restriction site, instead of the +3 typically used on larger

233

genomes. The primer combinations we used were: EcoRI-AC/MseI-CT (where AC are the two

234

additional base pairs on the EcoRI site and CT are the two base pairs on the MseI site), EcoRI-

235

TG/MseI-CC, EcoRI-AC/MseI-CT. Amplification products were denatured in formamide and

236

visualized on a 3730 ABI capillary sequencer. Data were analyzed using GeneMapper version

237

4.0 (ABI). Potential markers were scored using GeneMapper, and then inspected by eye. Clear

238

presence/absence patterns were recorded as 1 or 0, respectively. A total of 102 loci across 221

239

specimens were recovered and converted to a GenAlEx v6.5 format for downstream analyses

240

(Peakall & Smouse, 2012).

241
242

Genome sequencing, read filtering and variant calling

243

In 2016, genomes were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq2500 platform at the University of

244

Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center, typically with a 550 bp insert size and 251 bp paired-

245

end reads (13 specimens were prepared with 350-bp inserts; often these specimens represent

246

older collections [Supporting Information Table S1b]). Sequencing was performed using two

247

flow cells with 48 samples and two lanes each (ten samples either failed quality control or were

248

irrelevant to this study). Mean sequencing depth of each sample ranged from 10.56 to 150.86

249

(Supporting Information Table S1b). Sequence data were filtered using Trim Galore! (v0.4.5)

250

(https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore). Adapter trimming was set to the highest

251

stringency such that even a single nucleotide of overlap with the adapter sequence was trimmed

252

from a given read. After trimming, reads reduced to 100 bp or shorter, and those with quality

253

scores less than 30 were discarded.

254

A sporocarp from Dunas de Mira, São Jacinto, Portugal (specimen number 10511) was also

255

sequenced on four SMRTcells on a PacBio RS II Sequel platform, also at the University of

256

Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center (Supporting Information Table S1b). This resulted in

257

raw coverage of 47x with N50 read length of 6,310 bp.

258

After troubleshooting of genome assembly pipelines (summarized in Supporting Information

259

Table S2), the final assembly was performed using an in-house hybrid approach. First, Illumina

260

data were subjected to a second round of filtering using Trimmomatic v0.35 (Bolger et al., 2014)

261

with the following parameters: ILLUMINACLIP:TruSeq3-PE-2.fa:2:30:10 CROP:245

262

LEADING:30 TRAILING:30 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:25 MINLEN:100. PacBio data were

263

filtered to remove sequences shorter than 500 bp and error corrected with the Illumina data using

264

FMLRC (Wang et al., 2018) with default settings. Error-corrected PacBio reads were then used

265

to simulate 20x coverage 3 kb insert size libraries with wgsim (https://github.com/lh3/wgsim)

266

and parameter setting as follows: -e 0.0 -d 3000 -s 500 -1 100 -2 100 -r 0.0 -R 0.0 -S 123 -N

267

5000000. Illumina data and simulated long-range libraries were then assembled using

268

AllpathsLG v52400 (Gnerre et al., 2011), setting HAPLOIDIFY=True. The resulting assemblies

269

were subjected to further scaffolding using error-corrected PacBio data with the software LINKS

270

v.1.8.5 (Warren et al., 2015) with -d 2000,5000,10000,15000,20000 -t 20,20,5 and a kmer value

271

of 29. Scaffolds were extended and gap-filled using PBJelly v.15.8.24 and finally polished using

272

Pilon v.1.2 (Walker et al., 2014). Polished assemblies were evaluated with QUAST (Gurevich et

273

al., 2013) and BUSCO v.2 with the Basidiomycota database v.9 (Simão et al., 2015).

274

After genomes were assembled, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and indels were

275

identified using the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) software v3.8-0-ge9d806836 (McKenna

276

et al., 2010), following GATK best practices (Broad Institute 2019). Illumina reads from each of

277

the 86 Illumina genome libraries were first mapped to the hybrid assembly using bwa-0.7.9 (Li

278

2013) with the following parameters: mem -M -t 8 -v 2. Mapping rates for A. phalloides

279

specimens ranged from 20.0% - 95.3%, with a median mapping percentage of 86.1% (only older

280

specimens mapped at less than 50%). The mapping rate of 10511’s Illumina reads to the 10511

281

hybrid assembly was 93.8%. Duplicate reads were marked, and the GATK program

282

Haplotypecaller was used to call variants simultaneously on all samples, using

283

MODE=DISCOVERY and type=GVCF. This procedure resulted in 212,119 indels and

284

1,580,133 SNPs.

285

To eliminate any variants that may have been called as a result of sequencing errors, the raw

286

VCF file was filtered using VCFtools-0.1.14 (Danecek et al., 2011). We took a conservative

approach: loci with quality scores greater than 30 (--minQ 30); with sequencing depths greater

288

than the approximate mean depth across all loci and individuals (60X, or --min-meanDP 60);

289

with a minor allele frequency (MAF) greater than 0.006 (1/2N, where N=86 diploid individuals);

290

and with no more than 50% missing data (--max-missing 0.5), were kept in our dataset. To test

291

how different filtering criteria affected the ability to distinguish genotypes, the raw VCF file was

292

subjected to a variety of alternative filtering parameters (Supporting Information Table S1b, Fig.

293

S1). To remove any remaining erroneously called variants, we removed loci deviating from

294

Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, calculated per population using an exact test as defined by

295

Wigginton et al., (2005) (p-value cut-off 0.01; Supporting Information Table S1b). A total of ten

296

VCF files were produced: one encompassing all 86 individuals, and the remaining nine

297

containing a given population with loci deviating from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium removed.

298

Each VCF file was then converted to a .raw file format using PLINK v1.9 (Purcell et al., 2007)

299

for subsequent analyses in R v3.4.4 (R Core Team 2013).

Intrapopulation and interpopulation patterns of polymorphism and divergence
Statistical analyses were performed using R v3.4.4 and all scripts are available at

303

https://github.com/jacobgolan/genets. To calculate the genetic relationships among sporocarps of

304

both the AFLP and SNP datasets, we quantified the number of AFLP or SNP differences for

305

every pair of sporocarps within a given population, and any sporocarp pair with a difference of

306

zero was considered as belonging to the same genet (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4). Missing data are rare

307

(no AFLP data are missing, and only 0.73% of SNP data are missing), but a SNP locus at which

308

two samples differed by missing data was counted as “not different” so as to facilitate

309

comparisons among pairs of samples: each pairwise comparison using SNP data was scaled to

310

m(m-x)-1, where m is the total number of loci and x is the number of missing sites (Kamvar et

311

al., 2014). To understand how many markers are required to fully resolve genetic relationships

312

among AFLP and SNP genotypes, we randomly sampled 100 loci 1,000 times without

313

replacement, and calculated the number of unique genotypes for each random sample

314

(Supporting Information Methods S2, Fig. S1). Curves of these data were constructed by

315

adapting the poppr command from the package poppr v2.8.3 (Kamvar et al., 2014).

316

To understand genetic relationships among sporocarps collected across space and time, we

317

first took an ordination approach. Using ape v5.3 (Paradis & Schliep, 2018), we conducted a

318

principle coordinate analysis (PCoA) on pairwise differences of sporocarp AFLP and/or SNP

319

profiles. We plotted individual sporocarps using eigenvalues from the first two principal

320

coordinates. Axes are centered around the mean of eigenvalues per axis and scaled by the

321

standard deviation of eigenvalues per axis. The first two axes capture 27.42% and 16.27% of the

322

variance in the AFLP data, and 16.95% and 9.75% of the variance in the SNP data. Ellipses were

323

drawn to encompass a 0.95 confidence interval for each geographic region for AFLP data (Fig.

324

5), and labelled to highlight specific genetic and spatial clusters for SNP data (Fig. 6).

325

To test whether closely related sporocarps grow near each other, we performed Mantel tests

326

to test for correlations between genetic and physical distances. Analyses were performed using

327

vegan 2.5-5 on each population and then for geographic regions (e.g., California) and

328

subpopulation clusters identified from our PCoA analyses (Supporting Information Table S3;

329

Oksanen et al., 2018). To estimate the physical area of each population we first drew a polygon

330

around the perimeter of a population (as defined by sporocarps at the population’s edges) and

331

then estimated the smallest four-sided parallelogram that would completely enclose all

332

sporocarps using in-house R scripts and alphahull v2.1 (Pateiro-López & Rodríguez-Casal,

333

2010).

334

Finally, to infer population differentiation between adjacent locations sampled in the same

335

year, and between the same location sampled over time (e.g., relationships between Drake 2 and

336

Drake 3, both sampled in 2004, 2014, and 2015), we calculated FST for every pair of populations

337

and subpopulations with hierfstat v0.04-22 (Weir & Cockerham, 1984; Goudet, 2005).

Results
AFLP and SNP data
Sequencing resulted in 103 AFLP bands from 221 A. phalloides genomes and 1.2 raw

343

Illumina reads (an average of 3.6 M per sporocarp) from 86 A. phalloides genomes. The

344

assembled Illumina-PacBio hybrid genome of specimen 10511 (Mira, São Jacinto, Portugal)

345

resulted in a 35.5 Mb assembly covering approximately 77% of the estimated 43 Mb genome.

346

The assembly encompasses 605 scaffolds with an N50 of 320 kb, and gene space completeness is

347

estimated at 94.4%. The 86 full genomes mapped to the 10511 assembly provided 297,133 high

348

quality SNPs. Sporocarps with identical genotypes were found exclusively in the AFLP dataset

349

(Supporting Information Fig S2a,b, Fig. S3). The two most closely related SNP genotypes were

350

collected from Dunas de Mira, São Jacinto, Portugal (specimens 10511 and 10512), and they

351

differed by approximately 24,250 SNPs (scaling for missing data; Fig. 2, Supporting Information

352

Table S1b).

353

While the 221 sporocarps of the AFLP dataset resolve into 160 unique genotypes, a plot of

354

number of loci randomly sampled versus number of genotypes (Supporting Information Fig. S1)

355

suggests 103 AFLP markers do not fully resolve sporocarp identity (Grünwald et al., 2003). SNP

356

data provided greater resolution of genotypes, and both conventional and stringently

357

conservative filtering criteria resolved each sporocarp as a unique genotype (Supporting

358

Information Fig. S1). The different datasets result in different interpretations, for example, SNPs

359

delineate each sporocarp from population Drake 3 2004 as a unique individual whereas AFLP

360

markers resolve only two genets from the same sporocarps (Fig. 2, Fig. 3).

361
362
363

Most sporocarps of Amanita phalloides resolve into unique genotypes
Regardless of genotyping strategy, the dominant pattern emerging across California, the

364

Northeast U.S. and Europe is of populations consisting of multiple genets, most of which are

365

made up of a single sporocarp. Thus, we infer that movement across landscapes is mediated by

366

sexual basidiospores, and not asexual vegetative growth and fragmentation (Dahlberg & Stenlid,

367

1994). Moreover, populations sampled over time do not transition from being composed of

368

smaller and more numerous genets to being dominated by larger and less numerous genets (Fig.

369

4). The temporal succession of genotypes suggests individuals are not long lived and reproduce

370

shortly after establishing.

371

In fact, the majority of genets in both the AFLP and SNP datasets consist of a single

372

sporocarp (Table 1). Genets encompassing more than one sporocarp were found only within the

373

AFLP dataset. The 221 sporocarps genotyped by AFLP resolve into 160 unique genotypes,

374

72.40% represent unique genotypes and resolve into small genets consisting of either a single

375

sporocarp, or two to three mushrooms (Fig. 3, Supporting Information Fig. S2a,b, Fig. S3). The

376

longest distance between two identical sporocarps was calculated from Jake’s Landing (7.51 m),

377

the longest in California was found in Heart’s Desire 2 (5.14 m), and the longest in Europe was

378

found in Serbia (3.20 m). The median length of genets consisting of more than one sporocarp is

379

1.70m (1.12m in European populations, 2.20m in East Coast populations, 1.73m in Californian

380

populations; Table 1). However, we hypothesize any approach with greater resolving power

381

would distinguish many of these sporocarps as distinct genets.

382

Only one genet was found in more than one year: an AFLP genotype found at CESAC in

383

2002 was also found at CESAC in 2006 (specimens CESAC 54 and CESAC 21, separated by

384

0.81 meters; Fig. 4). But once again, we hypothesize any approach with greater resolving power

385

would distinguish these two sporocarps. In Californian populations, genotypes did not persist

386

from year to year and genets were consistently small regardless of genotyping method.

387
388
389

Spores of Amanita phalloides are dispersal limited between and within populations
At continental scales, genotypes cluster according to geography (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). However, a

390

subset of the genotypes from Europe, the East Coast, and California appear to be closely related.

391

In particular, AFLP genotypes from the East Coast appear closely related to European genotypes

392

from southern France, and to a lesser extent, a small subset of AFLP genotypes from California

393

(especially from Heart’s Desire populations) appear closely related to genotypes from both

394

southern France and the East Coast. There is less overlap among SNP genotypes identified from

395

Europe and California; SNP genotypes from Europe were collected mainly from central

396

Portugal, with a few collections also taken from throughout northern and eastern Europe, and

397

from Sardinia and Corsica, but notably not from southern France. But whether populations of A.

398

phalloides in North America were in fact introduced from southern France is an hypothesis

399

remaining to be tested.

400

Surprisingly, closely related genotypes also cluster at local spatial scales. Populations appear

401

genetically distinct and sporocarps collected from the same physical location group together and

13

402

apart from other populations. Moreover, sporocarps collected a few centimeters apart from each

403

other within a single population are often genetically more similar than sporocarps collected

404

meters apart (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). Within Drake 2 there is a clear subpopulation structure and two

405

distinct groups of genetically related sporocarps are apparent.

406

To delineate spatial autocorrelations more fully, we used Mantel tests to probe for

407

relationships between the physical and genetic distances separating sporocarps, asking whether

408

mushrooms found nearer each other are also more closely related. Correlations were significant

409

for seven of the 15 populations from which AFLP data were collected, and for two of the eight

410

populations from which SNP data were collected (Supporting Information Fig. S4a,b, Fig. S5;

411

Table S3). Mantel tests corroborate fine scale isolation by distance as a feature of multiple

412

populations (Fig. 7, Supporting Information Fig. S4a,b, Fig. S5). Moreover, when the data of

413

nearby populations were combined, for example, combining all of the data available from Point

414

Reyes National Seashore (Drake populations), Tomales Bay State Park (Heart’s Desire

415

populations), or New York (Rochester populations), correlations were also often significant

416

(Supporting Information Table S3). The physical area of a population did not influence whether

417

or not there was a significant Mantel correlation (linear regression of area versus the calculated

418

Mantel statistic: slope near zero and P >0.05 for both within and between populations).

419

Even across years, closely related genotypes often cluster in space (Fig. 6). For example,

420

individuals of Drake 2 collected in 2004, 2014 and 2015 cluster together and away from

421

individuals of Drake 3 collected in the same years. Subpopulations within single populations

422

persist through time, for example, the subpopulations identified from Drake 2 in 2014 were

423

found again in 2015 (Fig. 6). The data suggest spores fall and germinate within centimeters of

424

their parent sporocarps; even after a decade, Drake 2 and Drake 3 (which are less than 100 m

425

apart) remain genetically distinct.

426

Calculations of FST (Weir & Cockerham, 1984) confirm populations sustain a relative degree

427

of genetic differentiation across years (Hartl & Clark 2007; Branco et al., 2015; 2017). FST

428

calculated using the 2004, 2014, and 2015 data of Drake 2 ranges from 0.0054–0.0138, and for

429

Drake 3 ranges from 0.0003–0.0270. The FST statistic comparing the adjacent populations, Drake

430

2 and Drake 3, in 2004 is 0.0376 (0.021 with AFLP data), in 2014 is 0.0523, and in 2015 is

431

0.0398. FST comparing Drake 3 to either Drake 2 subpopulation (Cluster 1 or 2) reveals

433

0.0763±0.0040, respectively).

Discussion

436

The death cap uses sexual basidiospores to spread in both its native European range, as well

437

as in its introduced ranges on the East Coast and California. Vegetative fragmentation appears

438

rare. Populations consist of many small genets and typically each sporocarp is its own genet. But

439

correlations between geographic and genetic distances, even at small spatial scales (tens of

440

meters), suggest spores travel very short distances, falling near to parent sporocarps. In fact,

441

ordination analyses cluster populations in space, even across time: populations from a single

442

location sampled years apart cluster together and away from populations sampled in the same

443

year from nearby locations. Genets appear to be ephemeral, and except for a single pair of

444

sporocarps within the native range of A. phalloides (generated using AFLP data and potentially

445

an artifact), the same genotype was never recovered in more than one year (Fig. 4). Data suggest

446

frequent sexual reproduction and a high turnover of genets within populations, suggesting short

447

lifespans.

448

Small body sizes and ephemeral genets are typical of other ECM Basidiomycetes in native

449

ranges, paralleling our findings in an invasive system. The majority of genets of Hebeloma

450

cylindrosporum, Laccaria amethystina, Tricholoma terreum, and Russula cremoricolor are small

451

and either consist of single sporocarps or are less than a square meter in size (Gryta et al., 1997;

452

Gherbi et al., 1999; Redecker et al., 2001; Huai et al., 2003). A high turnover of genets within

453

populations appears typical of R. cremoricolor and T. scalpturatum (Redecker et al., 2001;

454

Carriconde et al., 2008).

455

Genet sizes across the genus Amanita appear variable. The species A. franchetii reaches a

456

maximum size of 4.7m, but populations house many singleton genets as well; populations of A.

457

manginiana are entirely composed of singleton genets, with no genotype recovered between

458

consecutive years (Sawyer et al., 2003; Liang et al., 2005). By contrast, A. conicoverrucosa, A.

459

punctata, A. pyramidifera, and A. muscaria appear to form genets made up of multiple

460

sporocarps and may reach tens of meters in size (Sawyer et al., 2001; 2003). However

461

fingerprinting techniques with low resolution may bias inferences by binning unique genetic

462

individuals together, as we discovered by comparing our AFLP and SNP datasets.

463

The example of A. muscaria is a particularly interesting comparison; like A. phalloides, it has

464

been introduced and is invasive outside of its native range (Richardson et al., 2000; Dickie &

465

Johnston, 2008; Dunk et al., 2012). The fungus now grows in Australia and New Zealand and is

466

invasive in Colombia (Sawyer et al., 2001; Bagley & Orlovitch 2004; Orlovitch & Cairney,

467

2004; Vargas et al., 2019). Colombian populations of A. muscaria associate with native Q.

468

humboldtii and are spreading through Colombian oak forests but Australian populations appear

469

confined to commercial plantations of introduced Pinus radiata (Sawyer et al., 2001). In contrast

470

to the death cap, available data suggest A. muscaria is found primarily as large genets in

471

Australia and New Zealand, apparently capable of steady vegetative growth below ground

472

(Sawyer et al., 2001). Whether large genets would be detected using modern fingerprinting

473

techniques or at sites outside of Australia and New Zealand remains to be tested, but if A.

474

muscaria does grow as large genets, data would suggest frequent sexual reproduction and

475

copious spore production are not required to facilitate invasions by ECM fungi.

476

Our nascent understanding of the mode and tempo of the death cap’s invasion dynamics is

477

likely to facilitate an understanding of the species elsewhere, and of the genus Amanita as a

478

source of invasive ECM species. A. phalloides has also been introduced to South America

479

(Singer, 1953; Takacs, 1961), East and South Africa (Walleyn & Rammeloo, 1994), Australia

480

(Talbot, 1976; Shepherd & Totterdell, 1988; Wood, 1997) and New Zealand (Taylor, 1982;

481

Ridley, 1991). Other species in the genus, including A. rubsescens, A. thiersii, and A. inopinata,

482

are introduced or invasive elsewhere (Bougher, 1996; Pegler & Shah-Smith, 1997; Sawyer et al.,

483

2003; Wolfe et al., 2012). The genus Amanita emerges as a developing model for work with

484

invasive ECM fungi, offering the potential for comparisons among closely related species

485

invasive in geographically distant ranges.

486

The life history of A. phalloides appears similar to the life history of many herbaceous weeds

487

(Baker, 1965; Grime, 1977; Roché & Thill, 2001). Basidiospores may give rise to relatively

488

small mycelia that persist for short periods of time before reproducing sexually. Life history

489

evolution among fungi is poorly described (a stark contrast to traditions within the plant

490

literature; Harper 1977; Grime 1977) but A. phalloides emerges in stark contrast to the

491

“humongous fungus,” epitomized by the pathogens Armillaria gallica (Anderson et al., 2018)

492

and A. ostoyae (Shaw & Roth, 1976; Ferguson et al., 2003). The death cap appears to persist in

493

habitats as a small bodied, ephemeral, potentially ruderal species.

494

However, dispersal is clearly not the only control on A. phalloides invasion dynamics. While

495

A. phalloides uses spores to establish in both California and on the East Coast, in California A.

496

phalloides is invasive while in New Jersey A. phalloides appears confined within planted forests

497

of Pinus strobus (Thompson et al., 2000; Wolfe & Pringle, 2011). In California, A. phalloides is

498

spreading in association with a native oak, a distant relative of the oaks in its native range (Hipp

499

et al., 2018). In New Jersey, A. phalloides grows at sites slightly outside of the southern range of

500

P. strobus. The associations of the death cap with different hosts, within and outside of hosts’

501

ranges, may be a key influence on its spread, but any potential mechanism mediating the

502

dynamic remains unknown (Richardson et al., 2000; Dickie et al., 2017).

503

The paradox of a dispersal limited invasive fungus suggests A. phalloides will move slowly

504

as it continues to spread through its habitats in California. An earlier estimate of approximately

505

five km yr-1 is almost certainly wrong (Pringle et al., 2009). Although, establishment from spores

506

does explain the death cap’s dominance in local habitats given the magnitude of its spore

507

production: reproduction measured for multiple sporocarps during a 48 hour incubation period

508

ranged from 2.22 × 107 to 1.58 × 108 spores per sporocarp (mean: 8.66 × 107 ± 1.90 × 107; Wolfe

509

& Pringle unpublished). At the Drake sites of Point Reyes National Seashore (labeled “Drake’s

510

Landing” in Wolfe et al., 2010) sporocarps of A. phalloides average more than half (and up to

511

85%) of the total biomass of ectomycorrhizal sporocarps collected in a single season (Wolfe et

512

al., 2010). As A. phalloides spores germinate and mycelia quickly reproduce to generate more

513

spores, a local feedback likely enables populations to grow rapidly.

514

The potentially ruderal niche of the death cap also suggests an effective management strategy

515

(Dickie et al., 2016). The mushrooms of the death cap are deadly, and each year in California

516

there are poisonings (Zevin et al., 1997; Bonacini et al., 2017; Vo et al., 2017). An increasingly

517

public discussion has focused attention on whether the fungus can be eradicated from local

518

landscapes (Dickie et al., 2016; Quirós 2016; Childs 2019). In fact, our data suggest a control

519

strategy: as a sporocarp of the death cap develops, its spore-bearing surface is covered by a

520

partial veil. As the sporocarp matures, the veil ruptures to release spores. Collecting and

521

destroying immature sporocarps before veil rupture would prevent spore release and the

522

subsequent establishment of mycelia. If spores are also short lived (an untested hypothesis),

523

mycelia would be unable to germinate from a spore bank. Because spores can’t travel very far,

524

thoroughly collecting at a site for just a few years would potentially break the life cycle of the

525

fungus and rid a habitat of an invasive and deadly poisonous fungus.

SNP data are labelled in orange. If locations were used to generate both AFLP and SNP data,

800

labels are both purple and orange. Singleton collections are marked with an asterisk. Collections

within a given population. Genetically identical sporocarps are marked with an arrow. To

805

accommodate missing data, SNP differences are scaled up proportionally to m (m-x)-1, where m

Fig. 3: Sporocarp maps and the genets identified in eight populations (data of all populations

809

found in Fig. S2a,b and Fig. S3). Sporocarps genotyped using AFLP data plotted as squares,

810

sporocarps genotyped using SNP data plotted as circles, and sporocarps genotyped with both

811

plotted as diamonds. Within each map, sporocarps belonging to the same genet are labelled using

812

a single color and surrounded by an arbitrarily shaped, transparent polygon of the same color.

813

Most genets are made up of a single sporocarp, regardless of technology. A dotted green polygon

814

groups sporocarps of Drake 3 2004 identified as a single genet using AFLP data but resolved as

815

distinct genotypes using SNP data. Note that the sporocarp at the top left was not included in the

816

SNP dataset and whether it would resolve into its own genet using SNP data is unknown.

Methods S1 Sporocarp Mapping Methods
Mapping
At CESAC (in 2002 and 2006) and Drake 2-3 (in 2014 and 2015) transects were measured
from an arbitrary center point within each population (at CESAC, a planted Cedrus libani) to
each sporocarp. The transect angle with respect to north and its distance from the center point
were recorded and data later converted to Cartesian coordinates.
Populations from Portugal (Vilarinho, Agraria, and Mira [collected in 2015]) were mapped
by measuring the distance between all pairs of sporocarps. Hand drawings of each population
were used to arbitrarily choose a single sporocarp as the population center. Cartesian coordinates
were then calculated for each sporocarp using the spatial distances between all pairs.
Populations from Drake 1-4 (in 2004), Heart’s Desire 1-3 (in 2004), Serbia (in 2007), Round
Valley (in 2006), Jake’s Landing (in 2006), and Rochester 1-3 (in 2007) were mapped using
transect lengths measured from each of two poles placed within each population to each
sporocarp. The distance between the two poles was also measured, allowing the length of each
transect to be considered as a radius in the mathematical equation of a circle. Using the transect
lengths as two intersecting radii, equations for each of two circles were algebraically solved to
obtain the Cartesian coordinates of each sporocarp. Using a rough sketch of each population, we
identified which point was the correct physical location of any given sporocarp.
After mapping, entire sporocarps were extracted from soil and stored individually in labelled
bags. Each sporocarp was assigned a unique five digit specimen number (Table S1a,b) tied to an
in-house database named AmanitaBASE.
Within 24 hours of sampling, fresh sporocarps were stored using a variety of protocols
including drying on a dehydrator, air drying at approximately 35ºC, flash freezing in liquid
nitrogen and then lyophilizing, and/or cutting apart and placing in CTAB (Table S1a.b, see
“Method of Preservation”). Exact protocols depended on the year, location, and the tools
available at the time of sampling. Specimens are stored in the Pringle laboratory herbarium
unless otherwise noted (Table S1a,b).
Single sporocarps were also collected opportunistically, sent to us by colleagues or loaned
from herbaria. We received permission to destructively sample herbarium specimens whose
original herbarium barcodes are listed in Supporting Information Table S1a,b.

Number of SNP Loci Randomly Sampled

Fig. S1 Genotype accumulation curves are in essence rarefactions of the numbers of genetic
markers needed to recover 100% of unique genotypes (Kamvar et al., 2014). One to 100 loci
were randomly sampled without replacement 1,000 times, and the raw counts of genotypes
observed from each random sampling used to generate means and standard errors. The curve
plateaus and variance is minimized at about 90 AFLP markers. Using VCFtools (Danecek et al.,
2011) we tested a variety of different VCF filters to gauge how each filter discriminated among
unique genotypes. Loci with a minor allele frequency lower than 0.006 ([2*N]-1, where N = 86
diploid sporocarps), or 0.49 (as an arbitrary and overly conservative filter), with a sequencing
depth below 60 (the approximate mean depth across all loci and individuals), and with missing
data thresholds per locus less than 0%, 50%, and 100%, were used in different combinations to
filter the raw VCF file. Dotted red lines mark the maximum number of genotypes recovered with
either AFLP or SNP data; dotted grey lines mark the total number of sporocarps used to generate
either AFLP or SNP datasets.
