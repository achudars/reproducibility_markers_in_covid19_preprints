Abstract
The primary purpose of purifying the bioactive small molecules is obtaining enough amount of
specific molecules for their downstream applications. There are various methods available for
serving this purpose. However, not all can afford for cost-effective purification methods,
especially for complex biological samples. Here we demonstrate, the Rotofor based preparative
IEF separation which shows the high possibility of separating and enriching desired molecules,
including small molecules and peptides from the complex plant extract. This method is wellsuited for use at any stage of a purification scheme and has been used for complex biological
samples quantification and characterization. As a proof of concept, we fractionated Gymnema
sylvestre plant extract and isolated a family of terpenoid saponin molecules at the acidic end and
small peptide molecule near the basic end. To our knowledge, this is a first report that Rotofor
can be used to fractionate bioactive small molecules from natural product sources. We also
showed effective microbial protein separation using Candida albicans fungus as a model system.
The Rotofor based IEF has appealing features such as low cost, simplicity, high application
potential and can be performed in any laboratory with the instrument setup.

Keywords: Rotofor isoelectric focusing (IEF); plant extract; peptide; small molecules; Gymnema

Introduction
The purification of biomolecules is the essential and difficult task of any biological experiments,
especially for a complex biological sample1. Biomolecules purification shows numerous
challenges due to their high complexity, low abundance, and extremes in their pI values and other
physicochemical properties2. Isoelectric focusing (IEF) is one of the finest techniques with high
resolution separation of complex biomolecules where ampholytes travel according to their
charge in the established pH gradient under the influence of an electric field until the net charge
of the molecule is zero3. There are several methods used for separation of biomolecules like
agarose and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE),
capillary electrophoresis, isotachophoresis and various chromatographic techniques (TLC, FPLC,
HPLC, etc.)2.
Rotofor (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), an IEF based apparatus consist of cylindrical focusing
chambers divided into 20 compartments and it provides up to 500-fold purification for a specific
molecule in < 4 hours. The most advantageous part of Rotofor is that it can be applied at any
stage of the purification process. For example, it can be used to purify complex biological samples
like animal tissue or plant leaf extract or for purifying the few nonspecific contaminants in the
pre purified protein sample4. Also, during the entire process the protein native conformation is
maintained as the experiment is run entirely in a free solution with controlled temperature.
Even though the use of Rotofor is reported widely for proteins, enzymes and antibody
purifications4-8, here we describe the use of Rotofor for separating and purifying small molecules
and peptides from the medicinal plant called Gymnema sylvestre. This will help the researchers
to concentrate and purify their active small molecules from a mixture of plant extract for their
downstream applications with less cost under native conditions. In addition, we also show the
enrichment of certain proteins from a complex protein extract from Candida albicans fungus9 in
Rotofor system as an example.
Protocol
1. Setup and prerunning of standard Rotofor unit
1. Equilibration of ion exchange membranes: The electrodes (anode -red button and cathode black button) with its respective exchange membrane were assembled according the
manufacturer’s instructions. The anion exchange membranes were equilibrated in 0.1 M NaOH
and the cation exchange membranes were equilibrated with 0.1 M H3PO4.
Note: The membranes should be stored in electrolytes between runs and not to be dried out.
2. Electrode assembly: The inner and outer portion of the electrode were assembled by aligning
three oblong holes in the ion-exchange gaskets. Fill the electrodes with respective electrolytes
(~25-30 mL) to prevent membrane from drying.
Note: Don’t add excess electrolyte which may build up pressure inside the electrode and cause
leaking.

3. Focusing chamber assembly: All the parts (anode electrode, membrane core, focusing chamber
and cathode electrode) were assembled over the ceramic cooling finger. Cover the sample
collection ports with a sealing tape.
Note: Refer Bio-Rad’s Rotofor® system instruction manual for detailed assembly instructions.
4. Connect the Rotofor to the coolant with 4ºC and prerun the unit with distilled water until the
voltage stabilizes.
Note: Prerun with distilled water helps to remove the residual base from the focusing chamber
and the nylon membrane core.
2. Separation and purification of small molecules and peptides from Gymnema sylvestre plant
extract
1. The plant extract (25% methanol extract, Suan Forma, NJ, USA) of G. sylvestre were weighed
(0.6 g) and dissolved in distilled water (60 mL) and mixed well.
Note: Any complex biological samples that are soluble and free of salt can be used for the
separation and purification using Rotofor. We have studied the saponin family of triterpenoid
compounds called gymnemic acids from G. sylvestre plant for their unique antifungal
properties10. Any plant extract with above mentioned properties can be used in Rotofor based
IEF.
2. Then the solubilize plant extract was briefly centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 5 min to remove
insoluble particles.
3. The supernatant was transferred to the new tube and mixed with ampholyte (pH 3-10, Biorad). We employed 1% (v/v) ampholyte concentration.
Note: An ampholyte concentration of up to 2% can be used. Always keep the samples, ampholyte
and water precooled on the ice.
4. Follow the steps from protocol no 1. Setup Rotofor assembly and prerun the standard Rotofor
unit for 3-5 minutes at 15W, 3000 Voltage or as per the Rotofor manual guidelines. Generally,
within one minute, the voltage will reach the maximum set values. Then switch off the power
source and remove the water from the cell using the fraction collector. Re-seal the collection
ports with sealing tape. Now the chamber is ready for loading the sample.
5. Load the prepared sample with ampholyte in the cell through sample injection ports. A 50 ml
syringe with a 1-1/2 inch 19-gauge needle was used for sample loading.
6. Remove air bubbles from the sample cell. The presence of air bubbles will cause voltage and
current fluctuations and affect the run.
Note: To remove air bubbles, remove the sample cell from the stand and tap the electrode
chamber to dislodge the bubbles.
7. Connect the unit to the coolant (4ºC) and start fractionation with the constant power supply.
We achieved a maximum of 750 voltage, 20 mA out of the set parameters (15W, 300 mA & 3000
voltage) in 4 hours of focusing at 5oC circulating water temperature.
8. Run the apparatus for 3 h or until the voltage reached a constant value.
9. After the run, fractions were collected in the harvest box (contains 20 tubes) connected to the
vacuum pump by pressing the harvest button “ON”.
10. Fractions were used for subsequent downstream applications (SDS-PAGE for peptide
quantification, TLC and bioassay for small molecules).

3. Separation and purification of proteins from C. albicans
1. Cell surface protein extract (non-glucan attached cell wall proteins) from C. albicans yeast cells
was prepared with ammonium carbonate (1.89 g/L) buffer containing 1% (v/v) betamercaptoethanol (ME) (1/10th of the culture volume) as described9.
Note: Protein samples from C. albicans cytosol, membrane or cell wall can be extracted by
different methods and can be used for Rotofor fractionation. Similarly, proteins from bacteria or
other biological samples (animal tissue extract or washes) can be used after removing any salt by
appropriate methods.
2. The protein extract was filtered (0.2 M filter) and dialyzed against water. The protein
concentration was estimated by the Bradford dye-binding method using gamma globulin as a
standard.
3. About 500 mg of total protein in 60 ml of water containing 1% (v/v) ampholyte (pH 5-8) was
used to fractionate the proteins. The maximum voltage of 2020 and 10 mA out of the set
parameters (15W, 300 mA & 3000 voltage) for a total of 4 hours focusing at 5oC circulating water
temperature were achieved.
Note: Since the broad-range ampholyte (pH 3-10) doesn’t enrich certain non-glucan attached cell
wall proteins of C. albicans well, we used a narrow-range (pH 5-8) ampholyte.
4. After 4 hours of focusing, protein fractions (1-20) were harvested as described above and
analyzed on 12.5% SDS-PAGE after reducing and boiling the protein samples.
5. Resolved proteins were stained with Coomassie blue dye and the gel was photographed.
4. Bioactivity of purified small molecules from plant extract Gymnema sylvestre
1. Overnight grown C. albicans yeast cells were diluted (1/1000 dilution) into a fresh RPMI cell
culture medium supplemented with 50 mM glucose.
Note: C. albicans converts from yeast growth to hyphae under hyphal inducing conditions (RPMI
at 37oC). Gymnemic acid small molecules are shown to inhibit the conversion of yeast cells into
hyphae under hypha inducing conditions10. We aim to determine if Rotofor separated G. sylvestre
extract contain these bioactive molecules.
2. From this cell suspension, 90 L was added to each well of the 96-well plate.
3. From each fraction, 10 L (1-20 harvested fractions, Figure 4) of G. sylvestre extract obtained
from Rotofor IEF were added into the wells. The assay was performed in triplicates.
4. As a negative control, 10 L of ampholyte in water (1%) was also used in separate wells.
Note: It is known that ampholytes have bioactivity potential and so it is essential to include
ampholytes control while performing any bioassay 11.
5. The 96-well plate was incubated at 37oC for 12 hours and inhibition of C. albicans yeast to
hypha conversion was observed under the microscope.
Results and Discussion
Small molecules from natural product sources (e.g. plants) are complex secondary metabolites
that are highly diverse in chemical structures and are believed to be involved in plant defense

mechanisms. Similarly, polypeptides are known to be present in plant tissues 12. These natural
product small molecules are rich sources for drug discovery and development. However, the
difficulties and tedious methods required for their isolation and purification limit their use for
therapeutic applications. The Rotofor IEF approach we used in this report highlights the ease of
separating these small molecules and polypeptides without compromising their bioactivities.
Using Rotofor preparative IEF method, we have fractionated a medicinal plant extract and cell
surface proteins from a human pathogenic fungus, C. albicans. A schematic of these fractionation
protocols is shown in Figure 1.
Out of 20 fractions of G. sylvestre extract obtained from Rotofor IEF, the dark-colored molecules
(terpenoid saponins) were migrated and enriched at the anode end (pH 2-3) and the light-yellow
clear fractions were observed at cathode end (pH 8-9) (Figure 2). Aliquots (20 l) from each
fraction (1-20) were separated after reducing and boiling on 15% SDS-PAGE. The Coomassie bluestained gel shows the diffused polypeptide band of about 5 kDa that is enriched in fractions 1619 (Figure 3). It has been reported that G. sylvestre plant contains a 35 amino acid gurmarin basic
polypeptide with the predicted molecular weight of 4,20913. This polypeptide is known to
suppress sweet-taste sensation13. Bacteria, plants and animals contain peptides, many of them
are circular (knottins) and stable with wide range of biological activities such as insecticidal and
antimicrobial12,14.
G. sylvestre plant also contains gymnemic acids (terpenoid saponins) as major constituents10,15,16.
As expected, these small molecules in fraction 1 and few next fractions were not detected by
SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining (Figure 3). However, these small molecules can be separated
by TLC and detected under the UV light (Figure 4, panel A, lane F1). Fraction 10 did not contain a
detectable amount of these small molecules on TLC suggesting most of the organic small
molecules were enriched in fractions 1-3. Gymnemic acids (GAs) molecules were shown to inhibit
C. albicans yeast to hypha transition10,17. We determined all the 20 fractions collected in this
study for their inhibitory activity against C. albicans yeast to hypha conversion and hyphal
growth. The results are shown in Figure 4, panel B & C. The highest activity is observed in fraction
1 which agrees with the TLC results where several spots can be seen. Isomers of gymnemic acids
exist and all of them have similar biological activities 10. These isomers were separated in fraction
1-3 and show inhibition of C. albicans hyphal growth (panels A & C, fraction 1). The degree of
hyphal inhibition was gradually decreased as it goes from 1 to 10. Least or no activity was
obtained in fractions 10 and above.
Results from Rotofor fractionation of C. albicans cell surface proteins are shown in Figure 5. These
cell surface proteins play important roles in C. albicans adhesion and pathogenesis. Several
enriched proteins (arrows) in different fractions were observed which may be useful to identify
for their immunological reactions with Candida infected human serum and identify by mass
spectrometry. The Rotofor based purification plays a crucial role in biomolecules separation and
purification, thus, when coupled with mass spectrometry analysis it will allow us to identify low
abundance proteins from complex biological samples.

In summary, using the Rotofor IEF method we have shown the separation of bioactive gymnemic
acids and gurmarin polypeptide from G. sylvestre leaf extract. To our knowledge, we are the first
one to register that Rotofor can also be used to purify bioactive small molecules from natural
product sources apart from proteins and peptides purification. Further, this IEF method can be
useful to enrich selective proteins from the complex crude extracts of pathogenic microbes.
