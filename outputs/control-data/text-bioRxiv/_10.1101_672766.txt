Summary

13

We present flexiMAP (flexible Modeling of Alternative PolyAdenylation), a new

14

beta-regression-based method implemented in R, for discovering differential

15

alternative polyadenylation events in standard RNA-seq data. Importantly, flexiMAP

16

allows modeling of multiple known covariates that often confound the results of

17

RNA-seq data analysis. We show, using simulated data, that flexiMAP is very

18

specific and outperforms in sensitivity existing methods, especially at low fold

19

changes. In addition, the tests on simulated data reveal some hitherto unrecognised

20

caveats of existing methods.

Introduction

30

Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is the selection of alternative cleavage and

31

polyadenylation sites during transcription of eukaryotic genes, resulting in isoforms

32

with distinct 3‚Äô untranslated regions. APA has been shown to be prevalent in

33

mammalian transcripts and alternative isoforms are linked to different stages of

34

development, cell types and disease status (Elkon et al., 2013; Szkop et al., 2017).

35

APA events can be identified on a genome-wide scale using 3‚Äô end-focused

36

sequencing or, more recently, long-read sequencing, but as these methods are still not

37

widely used and many legacy transcriptome surveys were carried out using standard

38

RNA-seq sequencing instead, it would be useful to have computational methods that

39

can identify differential APA in RNA-seq data. A few such methods exist already

40

(Xia et al., 2014; Grassi et al., 2016; Ha et al., 2018; Ye et al., 2018; Arefeen et al.,

41

2018) but they have caveats (Szkop and Nobeli, 2017). For example, all methods

42

must solve the problem of how to deal with biological replicates; some test the

43

replicates individually, losing the advantage of having replicates in the first place;

44

others, average values from replicates, effectively losing track of the within-group

45

variability. In designing a method for differential APA analysis, we considered the

46

following: a) the reconstruction and quantification of the individual isoforms is both

47

challenging and not strictly necessary for this task; b) the errors in modeling RNA-seq

48

read counts are neither normal nor Poisson-distributed; c) multiple covariates can

49

affect APA.

50
51

Inspired by the use of Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) in differential gene

52

expression (Robinson et al., 2010; Love et al., 2014) we present here a regression-

53

based method and associated pipeline (flexible modeling of APA or flexiMAP) that

54

satisfactorily addresses the above requirements. In addition, we show, using simulated

55

data, that the method is both sensitive and specific across a range of fold changes and

56

numbers of samples and that its performance is superior to three alternatives (DaPars

57

(Xia et al., 2014), Roar (Grassi et al., 2016) and APAtrap (Ye et al., 2018)) in most

58

tests we carried out. The method is available as an R package from:

Method Description

61

Our method can be applied to all pairs of polyadenylation sites in a gene, where one

62

site is considered ‚Äúdistal‚Äù (i.e. located furthest away from the end of the coding region)

63

and one is ‚Äúproximal‚Äù (Supp. Fig. 1). The proximal site separates the 3 ‚ÄòUTR into

64

two regions: the ‚Äúshort‚Äù region, starting at the end of the coding region and ending at

65

the proximal site, and the ‚Äúlong‚Äù region starting at the proximal site and ending at the

66

end of the transcript (Supp. Fig. 1). Assuming the separation of samples into groups

67

based on the condition of interest, the question we want to answer is: given a total

68

number of reads falling in the 3‚Äô UTR, is the proportion of reads falling in the long

69

region dependent on the sample group membership?

70
71

We count RNA-seq reads falling in the ‚Äúlong‚Äù and ‚Äúshort‚Äù regions of the 3‚Äô UTR

72

(Nlongij and Nshortij respectively), and define the ratio, R, for gene i in sample j as:
ùëÖ!" = !

73

!

long !"

short !"

!!long !"

(1)

74
75

Reads falling in the long region can only originate from transcripts using the distal

76

site, whereas reads falling in the short region may come from transcripts using either

77

the distal or the proximal site. The ratio Rij is the proportion of reads falling in the

78

long region and is thus strictly contained in the interval (0,1). We note that the

79

extreme value of zero is only encountered in the complete absence of a long isoform,

80

whereas values greater than 0.5 would be observed only in cases where the long

81

region is longer than the short region, or where strong 3‚Äô biases in the read coverage

82

are observed.

83
84

Our initial tests modeling APA events using logistic regression with quasi-binomial

85

error distribution (within the Generalised Linear Model framework) showed that this

86

approach was not sensitive enough for small numbers of samples or small fold

87

changes. Different link functions did not improve the results. To allow more

88

flexibility in modeling errors, we adopted instead a model where the response variable

89

is assumed to be beta-distributed. This beta-regression model was implemented using

90

the betareg package in R (Cribari-Neto and Zeileis, 2010). Results from the GLM

91

approach with a quasi-binomial error family are included below for comparison.

92
93

Finally, our method incorporates two filtering steps to improve accuracy, employing

94

TIN values (Wang et al., 2012) to filter on transcript integrity and removing

95

transcripts with too few reads mapping to the short region (see Supplemental Methods

96

for details).

97

Comparison to other methods using simulated data

98

We compared flexiMAP to three existing methods for APA analysis (DaPars (Xia et

99

al., 2014), Roar (Grassi et al., 2016) and APAtrap (Ye et al., 2018)) using simulated

100

data we produced with the polyester R package (Frazee et al., 2015) (see

101

Supplementary Methods for details). Our method is specific (none of the transcripts

102

with no APA events are predicted as having such events) and outperforms in

103

sensitivity DaPars and APAtrap up to a fold change of 4 (Fig. 1A, Supp. Fig. 2). For

104

larger fold changes, all methods appear to perform equally well. Surprisingly, the

105

application of post-detection filters recommended by the developers of both DaPars

106

and APAtrap appear to remove the majority of significant events across all fold

107

changes, which renders questionable the usefulness of these filters (Fig. 1A). Finally,

108

although Roar appears to be more sensitive than flexiMAP at small fold changes, in

109

reality it predicts all transcripts as having APA events, regardless of whether they do

110

or not, making its predictions unusable in practice (see also Supplementary Methods).

111
112

All methods, including flexiMAP, were sensitive to the expression level of the

113

transcript tested for differential polyadenylation (Fig. 1B). APA events that were

114

missed originated in transcripts of lower overall expression but the beta-regression

115

approach displayed improved sensitivity.

116
117

Unlike methods that average across samples from the same condition, the

118

performance of flexiMAP depends on the number of samples available in each group,

119

as expected for a method that needs to model the variance within each group (see

120

Supp. Fig. 3). However, flexiMAP is much more sensitive than the GLM-quasi-

121

binomial method at small sample sizes (<6), often encountered in RNA-seq datasets.

a) Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves representing the accuracy of detecting
differential alternative polyadenylation events using flexiMAP, DaPars, APAtrap and Roar.
Only transcripts where the polyadenylation site has been correctly predicted by DaPars and
APAtrap are included in this plot. FlexiMAP clearly outperformed DaPars and APAtrap by
perfect specificity and improved sensitivity. Although application of the PDUI post-hoc filter
(DaPars) and PD filter (APAtrap) (in dark blue and dark red respectively) corrected the false
positives problem of these methods, it did so at the cost of sensitivity. The Roar method
essentially predicts every change to be significant so, unsurprisingly, its results do not differ
from random guesses.
b) Dependence of method sensitivity on the overall expression level of the transcript (only
results for fold change=1.5 are shown). Transcripts with correctly predicted proximal sites
whose APA events have been (correctly) identified as being significantly different between
the two conditions show higher levels of expression across the whole 3‚Äô UTR, whereas events
that are missed originate in transcripts of lower overall expression. The beta-regression
approach displays improved sensitivity, with the remaining methods showing the same
overall trend but performing less well overall.
c) Example from the imbalanced simulated dataset of a situation where a covariate of no
interest (in this case, sex) affects the ratio of reads assigned to short and long isoforms. Male
samples display much higher expression of the short region of transcript NM_003613

compared with female ones, regardless of the condition group samples belong to. In addition,
the dataset is imbalanced, with more males present in condition 1 than condition 2. The mean
expression for condition 1 is thus higher than the mean for condition 2, but the effect is due to
the covariate sex, not the condition to which the samples belong to.
d) DaPars and APAtrap report a large number of false positives for an imbalanced simulated
dataset. In contrast, flexiMAP reports only one false positive in this case, highlighting its
main advantage over alternative approaches.

154

The development of flexiMAP was primarily driven by the need to model multiple

155

known covariates in APA analysis. Indeed, flexiMAP successfully discriminates

156

between the effect of the condition of interest and that of an additional covariate in a

157

simple simulated scenario of imbalanced datasets, where APA originates from the sex

158

attribute of the samples rather than the condition of interest (Fig. 1C-D). Methods that

159

cannot account for multiple covariates misinterpret the origin of this variation,

160

resulting in increased false positive rates.

161

Conclusion

162

We presented here flexiMAP, a beta-regression-based method for detecting

163

alternative polyadenylation events in RNA-seq data, given a list of putative

164

polyadenylation sites. Our method is both sensitive and specific, even when small

165

numbers of samples are used, and has the distinct advantage of being able to model

166

contributions from known covariates that would otherwise confound the results of

167

APA analysis. flexiMAP compares favourably with existing alternatives in tests

168

involving simulated datasets. Importantly, these tests have highlighted some hitherto

169

overlooked caveats of existing methods.
