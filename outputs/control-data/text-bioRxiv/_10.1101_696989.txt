Abstract

2

In vertebrates, any transmission of vocal signals faces the challenge of acoustic

3

interferences such as heavy rain, wind, animal, or urban sounds. Consequently, several

4

mechanisms and strategies have evolved to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio. Examples to

5

increase detectability are the Lombard effect, an involuntary rise in call amplitude in

6

response to masking ambient noise, which is often associated with several other vocal

7

changes such as call frequency and duration, as well as the animals’ capability of limiting

8

calling to periods where noise perturbation is absent. Previous studies revealed rapid vocal

9

flexibility and various audio-vocal integration mechanisms in marmoset monkeys. Using

10

acoustic perturbation triggered by vocal behavior, we investigated whether marmoset

11

monkeys are capable of exhibiting changes in call structure when perturbing noise starts

12

after call onset or whether such effects only occur if noise perturbation starts prior to call

13

onset. We show that marmoset monkeys are capable of rapidly modulating call amplitude

14

and frequency in response to such perturbing noise bursts. Vocalizations swiftly increased

15

call frequency after noise onset indicating a rapid effect of perturbing noise on vocal motor

16

pattern production. Call amplitudes were also affected. Interestingly, however, the

17

marmosets did not exhibit the Lombard effect as previously reported but decreased their call

18

intensity in response to perturbing noise. Our findings indicate that marmosets possess a

19

general avoidance strategy to call in the presences of ambient noise and suggest that these

20

animals are capable of counteracting a previously thought involuntary audio-vocal

21

mechanism, the Lombard effect, presumably via cognitive control processes.

Introduction

26

Communication between individuals is a crucial aspect for evolutionary success and appears

27

in various forms in nature ranging from olfactory [1,2] to visual [3] to vocal signals [4]. For

28

proper communication, the transmission of a signal sent out by a sender has to be detected

29

and decoded by one or more receivers [5]. Therefore, the sender has to be able to modulate

30

the signal in response to potential masking ambient noise to ensure proper signal

31

transmission. For vocal communication in vertebrates, several mechanisms have evolved to

32

compensate for masking acoustic interferences, such as heavy rain, wind, animal, or urban

33

sounds, leading to changes in temporal and spectral features of the vocal signals [6]. Such

34

vocal modifications can happen involuntarily as well as under volitional control.

35

One of the most efficient mechanisms to increase signal-to-noise ratio in call production is

36

the so-called Lombard effect, i.e., the involuntary increase in call amplitude in response to

37

masking ambient noise [7]. It is often accompanied by a shift in call frequency[8,9] as well as

38

a change in call duration [10,11] and has been shown in many vertebrate species from fish

39

to frogs to birds to mammals including humans [12,13], suggesting that the Lombard effect is

40

an evolutionary old behavior that may have emerged about 450 million years ago. Another

41

successful strategy to increase detectability in a noisy environment is the restraint of call

42

emission to timeslots where noise perturbation is low or absent [10,14,15]. This approach

43

renders the modification of call parameters unnecessary and avoids the increased

44

physiological cost of call emission at high intensities that might still be insufficiently

45

increasing signal-to-noise ratio.

46

The common marmoset, a small, highly vocal New World monkey indigenous to the dense

47

rainforests of Brazil, has been shown to exhibit vocal flexibility, such as increasing call

48

intensity [16,17] or increasing the duration of specific calls [17], as well as the attempt to call

49

in silent gaps [14], in the presence of perturbing ambient noise. These findings suggest that

50

while these animals generally seem to prefer avoiding calling in a noisy environment, they do

51

exhibit the involuntary audio-vocal effects discussed above when doing so. This idea is

52

supported by a recent study showing that marmoset tend to produce single calls instead of

53

call sequences in response to perturbing noise stimuli [18]. Interestingly, marmoset monkeys

54

are also capable of interrupting ongoing vocalizations rapidly after noise perturbation onset

55

[18], overturning decades-old concepts regarding vocal pattern generation [19–21],

56

indicating that vocalizations do not consist of one discrete call pattern but are built of many

57

sequentially uttered units that might be modulated and initiated independently of each other.

58

However, it is yet unclear whether audio-vocal mechanisms, such as the Lombard effect and

59

its accompanied changes in call frequency, can be rapidly elicited in cases where the

60

perturbing noise starts after call onset or whether such effects only occur if noise

61

perturbation starts prior to call onset.

62

In the present study we use acoustic perturbation triggered by the vocal behavior itself to

63

test in a controlled experimental design whether marmosets are capable of rapidly

64

modulating distinct vocal parameters such as call frequency and amplitude in ongoing

65

vocalizations. Performing quantitative measures of resulting adjustments, we show that

66

marmoset monkeys are able to specifically and rapidly modulate call frequency and

67

amplitude as a response to white noise stimuli in ongoing vocal utterances. Hereby, our data

68

indicate that marmosets exhibit a decrease in call amplitude as a result of such noise

69

perturbation, suggesting a mechanism counteracting the rise in amplitude caused by the

70

Lombard effect.

Results

72

We measured vocal behavior in marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus, n = 4), a highly vocal

73

New World monkey species, while separated in a soundproofed chamber, with and without

74

acoustic perturbation (Fig. 1A and B). In this setting, marmoset monkeys predominantly

75

produced phee calls (monkey H: 92.0%, S: 99.1%, F: 96.8%, W: 95.6%), long-distance

76

contact calls, composed of one (so-called single phees), two (double phees), or more phee

77

syllables, to interact with conspecifics [22] (Fig. 1C). Other call types such as trill-phees,

78

twitters, trills, tsik-ekks [22,23], and segmented phees [24] were rarely uttered (all other call

79

types were well below 2.5% in all monkeys except trill-phees in monkey H [4.6%]).

80

We perturbed 2/3 of calls with noise playback after vocal onset to ensure perturbation

81

starting after call initiation (Fig. 1B). To investigate whether perturbation of different

82

frequency bands within the hearing range of the monkeys has different effects on their vocal

83

behavior, we played back five different noise band conditions (broadband noise and

84

bandpass filtered noise bands below [0.1–5 kHz], around [5–10 kHz], or above the

85

fundamental frequency of phee calls [noise bands of 10–15 kHz and 16–21 kHz] at four

86

different amplitudes [50 dB, 60 dB, 70 dB, 80 dB] each). All noise conditions were played

87

back pseudo-randomly in blocks of 30 uttered vocalizations, resulting in 20 calls being

88

perturbed by noise after call onset and 10 calls not being perturbed by noise (control). In

89

total, our monkeys produced 6,298 phees (monkey F = 1544 phees, H = 1471, S = 1631, W

90

= 1652). Monkeys uttered mostly single and double phees (multi-syllabic phees with more

91

than two syllables were rare or absent: monkey F = 6.5%, H = 0.4%, S = 1.3%, absent in W),

92

with double phee rates between 8.4% and 55.5% (mean: 29.5% ± 9.8%, n = 4 monkeys) in

93

the control condition.

94

We first investigated if and how marmosets changed the fundamental frequency of their

95

ongoing phee syllables when perturbed by different noise conditions. We found an increase

96

in first syllable frequencies (F(3,4904)=6.42, p=2.0e-04 for amplitude, F(4,4904)=20.68,

97

p<0.0001 for frequency, n=3180). Those frequency shifts were significant in the 0.1–5.1 kHz

98

at 80 dB noise condition (38.5±13.8 Hz, p=1.02e-02, n=168), in the two loudest conditions of

99

the 5–10 kHz noise band (70 dB: 56.9±14.5 Hz, p=3.20e-03, n=165; 80 dB: 76.7±16.4 Hz,

100

p=4.12e-08, n=134), and in all four amplitude conditions of broadband noise (50 dB:

101

39.2±13.7 Hz, p=5.03e-10, n=159; 60 dB: 68.6±13.4 Hz, p=1.21e-08, n=143; 70 dB:

102

104.1±12.5 Hz, p=3.99e-13, n=135; 80 dB: 101.7±16.1 Hz, p=1.66e-20, n=118; control:

103

n=1733; Fig. 2A). The largest frequency shift could be observed for 70 dB broadband noise,

104

while in the next higher intensity condition (80 dB), there was no further increase in

105

frequency (p=1, n=253), indicating that marmosets are only capable of altering their

106

fundamental frequency within a certain range. Frequency shifts were not observed in calls

107

that were produced during 10–15 kHz and 16–21 kHz noise band perturbations (p=1, n=669

108

for the 10–15 kHz noise band, n=652 for the 16–21 kHz noise band, Fig. 2A). Second phee

109

syllables showed no significant shift in fundamental frequencies when perturbed by noise

110

(F(3,1343)=1.56, p=0.20 for amplitude, F(4,1343)=1.24, p=0.29 for frequency, n=761 , Fig.

111

2B).

112

Next, we quantified the magnitude of the observed frequency shifts by calculating population

113

effect sizes (ES) of the factors frequency (ESfreq), amplitude (ESampl), and the combination of

114

both conditions (ESfreq

115

effect would be given if the corresponding ES value of a factor was above the threshold of

116

0.02 as suggested by Cohen (1992). We found ESfreq x ampl values of 0.035 for first syllables

117

and 0.019 for second syllables, indicating an effect for first syllables (Fig. 2A and 2B). ESfreq

118

for the first syllable was above the threshold (ESfreq=0.023), while ESampl was below

119

(ESampl=0.01), indicating that the shifts in fundamental frequency were mainly correlated with

120

the different noise rather than amplitude conditions.

121

We then tested how fast fundamental frequency shifts occurred within the first phee syllables

122

after noise onset. Therefore, we plotted the mean fundamental frequency courses starting at

123

noise onset times (Fig. 2C and fig. S5). The shortest latency of fundamental frequency

124

shifts within a noise condition was defined as the moment where fundamental frequency

x ampl)

according to Cohen (1992) (see Material and Methods). An

125

shifts were significant for a minimum of five consecutive milliseconds after noise onset.

126

Shortest latencies were found for the 0.1–5.1 kHz noise condition at 80 dB (33 ms, n=168)

127

and all broadband conditions (50 dB: 29 ms, n=159; 60 dB: 34 ms, n=143; 70 dB: 25 ms,

128

n=135; 80 dB: 25 ms, n=118), resulting in a mean latency of 29.2±1.9 ms.

129

Subsequently, we investigated how call amplitudes changed in response to noise

130

perturbation. We calculated mean amplitude shifts after noise onset for first and second

131

phee syllables (Fig. 3A and fig. 3B). We found a significant decrease in call amplitude for

132

first phee syllables (F(3,3084)=1.01, p=0.39 for amplitude, F(4,3084)=5.3, p=0.0003 for

133

frequency, n=2019). These shifts were significant for the two middle intensity levels of the

134

0.1–5.1 kHz noise (60 dB: -1.7±0.5 dB p=3.28e-03, n=103; 70 dB: -2.7±0.5 dB, p=8.17e-04,

135

n=119) as well as for the two middle intensity levels of the broadband noise (60 dB: -2.3±0.6

136

dB, p=5.15e-03, n=93; 70 dB: -2.0±0.6 dB, p=8.59e-04, n=85). However, we could not find

137

any systematic increase in amplitude shifts or significant amplitude shifts in any of the five

138

noise conditions (n=3093; Fig. 3A). Furthermore, the combined effect size (ESfreq

139

ampl=0.024)

140

amplitude (ESampl=0.007) factors were below 0.02, indicating that noise perturbation of

141

ongoing first syllables has only a small or no effect on amplitude shifts.

142

However, there was also an amplitude decrease in second phee syllables (F(3,350)=3.76,

143

p=0.011 for amplitude, F(4,950)=1.71, p=0.15 for frequency, n=554). The amplitude shifts in

144

the 0.1–5.1 kHz and 5–10 kHz noise conditions were significant at the highest intensity

145

levels (-7.2±1.3 dB, p=3.90e-02, n=19 and -7.9±3.1 dB, p=2.68e-03, n=16, respectively; fig.

146

3B). Monkeys decreased their call amplitudes in these two conditions with increasing noise

147

intensity levels while no significant call amplitude changes were observed in the other three

148

conditions. All three ES values were above 0.02 (ESfreq

149

ESampl=0.024) suggesting an effect of specific noise perturbation on amplitude shifts of

150

second phee syllables in marmoset monkeys. Although it has been already shown that

151

marmoset monkeys show the Lombard effect while producing twitter calls[17], our results

152

might indicate that marmoset monkeys do not exhibit this reflex when producing phee calls

153

or suppress it and lower their call intensities instead.

154

To test whether our animals are able to show a Lombard effect or suppress it in a noisy

155

environment in general when producing phee calls, we modified our behavioral experiment

156

scheme. We played back all five noise conditions [0.1–5 kHz, 5–10 kHz, 10–15 kHz, 16–21

157

kHz, and broadband] at 70 dB SPL amplitude intensity plus two control conditions with a

158

duration of 180 s each, resulting in a block of seven pseudorandomized playback conditions

159

with a total duration of 1260 s. In this new experiment our monkeys produced a total of 803

160

phee calls (monkey F = 222 phees, H = 270, S = 158, W = 153), which were more commonly

161

uttered (F = 82.5%, H = 80.4%, S = 84.0%, W = 100%) than other produced call types. The

162

relative amounts of single phees ranged between 34.8% and 56.3% and the relative

163

amounts of double phees ranged between 43.71% and 59.49%. Multi-syllabic phees (F =

164

0.5%, H = 1.9%, S = 5.7%, W = 0%) and segmented phees (F = 0.4%, H = 2.4%, S = 0%, W

165

= 0%) were nearly absent. Monkey H produced 14.3% trill-phees and monkeys F and S

166

produced 15.2% and 13.8% tsik-ekks, respectively. All other call types were below 2.5% for

167

all monkeys. Under these experimental conditions we found that monkey W significantly

168

increased its call intensity for both phee syllables when perturbed by noise (first syllable:

169

6.4±0.8 dB, p=1.57e-03, n=107; second syllable: 8.4±0.9 dB, p=6.52e-03, n=46; fig. 3C and

170

fig. S6), thus, exhibiting the Lombard effect. Furthermore, monkey S significantly decreased

171

the intensity of the second phee syllable and exhibited no changes in call intensity of the first

172

syllable (second syllable: -4.2±1.0 dB, p=2.15e-03, n=52; first syllable: p=0.10, n=68) while

173

monkeys F and H showed no significant amplitude change under noise perturbation (first

174

syllable (H): p=0.89, second syllable (H): p=0.15, n=234 ; first syllable (F): p=0.91, second

175

syllable (F): p=0.06, n=184). Taken together, the present results suggest that marmosets are

176

capable of exhibiting as well as actively suppressing the Lombard effect in a noisy

177

environment during phee call production.

Discussion

179

Our results demonstrate that marmoset monkeys show rapid modulation of call parameters

180

in response to perturbing noise bursts presented after call onset. Ongoing phee

181

vocalizations perturbed by ambient noise rapidly increased call frequency in cases where the

182

fundamental frequency was above or directly masked by the perturbing noise. Bandpass-

183

filtered noise bursts, which did not mask but were above the fundamental frequencies of the

184

calls, had no effect on call frequency. Additionally, call amplitudes of phee calls were

185

affected by low frequency noise bands and broadband noise. Surprisingly, phee calls

186

perturbed after call onset did not exhibit a Lombard effect as previously reported for calls

187

that were produced in constantly presented ambient noise [17,25]. Instead, our monkeys

188

decreased their call intensity in a stepwise function with increasing noise intensity. Our

189

findings suggest a general strategy of avoiding calling in a noisy environment in marmoset

190

monkeys.

191

Effects of ambient noise on call frequency. Noise-dependent shifts in call frequency are

192

not well-studied and relatively poorly understood. Only a few studies have reported a rise in

193

call frequencies with increasing amplitudes of ambient noise in birds and bats [8,9,26] and

194

only one study investigated the effect of different noise bands on call frequencies. In bats,

195

the frequencies of echolocation calls increased significantly for a variety of noise stimuli no

196

matter whether they were directly masking the call’s fundamental frequency or presented

197

below the dominant call frequency [8]. In contrast, the present study shows that in

198

marmosets, call frequency was predominantly only affected when we directly masked the

199

calls fundamental frequency. As a result, the strongest rise in call frequencies were found for

200

high noise amplitudes. These findings suggest that the observed rises in call frequencies are

201

an audio-vocal mechanism elicited to increase call detectability in a noisy environment, as

202

has been found in previous studies involving birds [27–29]. Here, it has been predicted that

203

shifts in song frequencies of about 200 Hz increase call detectability by about 10 to 20%

204

[28], which is mainly due to the fact that the spectrum of environmental noise generally

9

205

shows a decay in amplitude with increasing frequency [28–31]. In the present study, shifts in

206

call frequency occurred with a mean latency of about 30 ms after noise onset suggesting a

207

rapid underlying neural mechanism for frequency modulation. Such fast responses to

208

ambient noise have yet only been found in echolocating bats, which exhibit an increase in

209

call amplitude in about 30 ms after noise onset as well [32].

210

Effects of ambient noise on call amplitude. Despite the positive effect of rises in call

211

frequency on signal detectability, the most effective mechanism to improve signal to noise

212

ratio in a noisy environment during vocal production is the Lombard effect, i.e., the

213

involuntary rise in call amplitude as a response to masking noise [12,13]. In the present

214

study, noise perturbation starting after phee call onset had no systematic effect on call

215

amplitude of the first syllable, i.e., the syllable during which noise perturbation started. In

216

cases in which significant shifts occurred, call amplitude did not increase, as expected, but

217

decreased with small effect sizes. This effect was stronger for the second syllables of the

218

phee calls, in which a strong decrease in call amplitude could be observed for low frequency

219

noise conditions. Consequently, call intensity decreased in a stepwise function with

220

increasing noise intensity suggesting a direct effect of noise intensity on call amplitude. In

221

contrast to our study, the Lombard effect has been observed in marmoset monkeys in a

222

previous study [17]. This apparent discrepancy might be explained by the different call types

223

that were investigated in both studies. While we focused on phee calls, a high amplitude call

224

that is produced at the upper end of the amplitude scale [16], the earlier study investigated

225

the twitter call, a vocalization that is produced at lower amplitude intensities [17].

226

Our results suggest an audio-vocal integration mechanism in marmoset monkeys that is

227

capable of counteracting the Lombard effect. Such a mechanism has been already shown to

228

exist in vocal production learners such as birds and humans [33–36] and seems to be mainly

229

driven by higher-order cognitive processes including cortical structures [13].

230

Vocal flexibility during perturbing noise in marmoset monkeys. Current studies have

231

revealed a high degree of vocal flexibility in marmoset monkeys [37], allowing them to

232

control when[14], where[38], and what to vocalize[39]. In addition, recent studies revealed

233

that marmosets are able to modulate distinct call parameters in response to acoustic

234

feedback [18,40]. This vocal flexibility allows marmosets to avoid calling in the presence of

235

environmental noise and predominantly initiate their vocalizations in silent periods [14]. In a

236

previous study, we demonstrated that marmosets interrupt their vocalizations shortly after

237

noise onset when perturbation starts after vocal onset [18], supporting the idea that these

238

animals tend to avoid calling in ambient noise. Such call interruptions, however, were rare

239

(2.6% of all calls), indicating stark neuronal and/or anatomical constraints in exhibiting such

240

behavior [18] and resulting in a large fraction of phee calls being perturbed by noise bursts.

241

In the present study, we show that the call amplitude of such vocalizations are lower.

242

We suggest that marmoset monkeys exhibit this vocal behavior in a noisy environment to

243

reduce the physiological costs of high intensity phee calls. Marmoset phee calls are elicited

244

at high intensities above 100 dB SPL, resulting in high muscle tensions encompassing

245

almost the entire animal’s body during call production (own observation). Therefore,

246

mechanisms might have evolved in these animals that ensure the proper transmission of

247

these high energetic calls resulting in calling in silent gaps and decreasing call intensity in

248

situations in which sufficient detectability might be potentially diminished, such as during the

249

presence of ambient noise.

250

Mechanisms counteracting involuntary audio-vocal effects need cognitive control.

251

Based on the current work and earlier studies [14,18], we propose a hypothetical neuronal

252

model suggesting various audio-vocal control mechanism involving cortical, subcortical, and

253

corticofugal connections capable of modulating vocal behavior in a noisy environment (Fig.

4). In accordance to earlier work [41,42], our model consists of a volitional articulatory motor

255

network originating in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) cognitively controlling vocal output of a

256

phylogenetically conserved primary vocal motor network predominantly consisting of a

257

subcortical neuronal network. The vocal motor network can be modulated by auditory

258

structures on several cortical and subcortical brain levels [13]. The decision to initiate or

259

suppress a call, as well as counteracting an involuntary effect (Lombard effect), needs

260

cognitive control. The ability to interrupt calls or modulate call parameters as a response to

261

perturbing noise might be controlled by both subcortical mechanisms and corticofugal

262

projections. Neurophysiological studies will now have to elucidate at which brain levels

263

audio-vocal integration mechanisms exist that explain the observed capabilities of marmoset

264

monkeys to counteract a previously thought involuntary audio-vocal mechanism, the

265

Lombard effect.

266

Material and Methods

267

Animal Housing and Maintenance. Four adult marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) were

268

used in the present study. Monkeys were usually kept in different sex pairs and were all born

269

in captivity. The animals had ad libitum access to water and were fed on a restricted food

270

protocol including a daily basis of commercial pellets, fruits, vegetables, mealworms, and

271

locusts. Additional treats, such as marshmallows or grapes, were used as positive

272

reinforcements to transfer the animals from their home cage to the experimental cage.

273

Environmental conditions in the animal husbandry were maintained at a temperature of

274

26°C, 40-60% relative humidity, and a 12h:12h day/night cycle. All animal handling

275

procedures were in accordance with the guidelines for animal experimentation and

276

authorized by the national authority, the Regierungspräsidium Tübingen. All vocalizations

277

analyzed in this study are a fraction of calls that have been recorded in a previous study

278

(Pomberger et al. 2018).

279

Experimental Setup and Procedure. The vocal behavior of four animals was recorded in a

280

soundproof chamber in response to noise playback that was initiated after vocal onset as

281

reported earlier (Pomberger et al., 2018). Briefly, the animals were transferred into a

282

recording cage (0.6 x 0.6 x 0.8 m), which was placed in a soundproofed chamber, with ad

283

libitum access to water and food pellets throughout the recording period. In this behavioral

284

setup, marmoset monkeys predominantly produce phee calls to interact with conspecifics

285

(phee ratio within all uttered calls; monkey S: 99.1 %, H: 92.0 %, W: 95.6 %, F: 96.8 %).

286

Other call types such as trill-phees, twitter, trills, tsik-ekks [22], or segmented phees [24]

287

were only rarely uttered (ratios were well below 2.5% for all other call types in all monkeys

288

except trill-phees in monkey H [4.6 %]). Monkeys produced a mean of 118±9 (monkey S),

289

167±31 (H), 117±10 (W), and 87±7 (F) phee calls per session. The vocal behavior of each

290

individual monkey was recorded once a day in sessions ranging between one and two hours

291

in duration. Data were collected in sessions at various times during the day between 11 am

292

and 5 pm. Recordings were performed for 10–28 days (mean: 17±3 days) for each individual

293

animal. The monkey’s behavior was constantly monitored and observed with a video camera

294

(ace acA1300-60gc, Basler, Germany with 4.5–12.5 mm CS-Mount Objective H3Z4512CS-

295

IR 1/2, Computar, Japan) placed on top of the cage and recorded with standard software

296

(Ethovision XT version 4.2.22, Noldus, the Netherlands). The vocal behavior was collected

297

with eight microphones (MKH 8020 microphone with MZX 8000 preamplifier, Sennheiser,

298

Germany), which were positioned in an octagonal design around the cage (Fig. 1A),

299

digitized using an A/D interface (Octacapture, Roland, Japan; sample rate: 96 kHz), and

300

recorded using standard software (Avisoft-Recorder, Avisoft Bioacoustics, Germany). A

301

custom-written program (OpenEX, Tucker-Davis Technologies, U.S.A.) running on a

302

workstation (WS-X in combination with an RZ6D multi I/O processor, Tucker-Davis

303

Technologies, U.S.A.) monitored the vocal behavior in real-time via an additional

304

microphone (MKH 8020 microphone with MZX 8000 preamplifier, Sennheiser, Germany)

305

placed on top of the cage, which automatically detected vocalizations through online

306

calculation of several acoustic parameters, such as call intensity, minimum duration of call

307

intensity duration, call frequency, and several spectral features. The median vocal detection

308

rate was well above 99% and three out of four vocalizations were detected within the first

309

146 ms after call onset (Fig. 1B).

310

The eight microphones positioned around the cage were installed to ensure precise

311

calculation of dB SPL values of vocalizations with a corresponding microphone being

312

positioned in front of the monkey (for detail see below).

313

For two out of three uttered vocalizations, we played back noise bursts of different

314

frequency-bands and amplitudes via a loudspeaker (MF1 Multi-Field Magnetic Speakers,

315

Tucker-Davis Technologies, U.S.A.) positioned on top of the cage, immediately after vocal

316

detection. Noise bursts had a duration of 4 s (including 10 ms rise times) to ensure noise

317

perturbation throughout the first phee syllable as well as the initiation of the second syllable

318

(Fig. 1C). Five different noise band conditions (broadband noise and bandpass filtered noise

319

bands: 0.1–5.1 kHz, 5–10 kHz, 10–15 kHz, and 16–21 kHz) were played back at four

320

different amplitudes (50 dB, 60 dB, 70 dB, 80 dB) each. All 20 noise conditions were played

321

back pseudo-randomly in blocks of 30 uttered vocalizations, resulting in 20 calls being

322

perturbed with noise after call onset and 10 calls without noise playback remaining

323

unaffected (control). After one block ended, a new block was generated. Noise playback

324

generation and presentation were performed with the same custom-written software used for

325

call detection.

326

Data Analysis. We programmed a custom-written GUI (Matlab, Mathworks, U.S.A.) to clock

327

Avisoft, Noldus, and TDT recordings offline and to extract the detected calls from the

328

recording channel with the best SNR. Vocal onset to offset were manually flagged as well as

329

noise onset times using the aligned sono- and spectrogram of vocalizations. We used a

330

Hanning window with a 512-window size, 1024 FFT, overlap of 25%, and temporal resolution

331

of one millisecond. We only considered first phee syllables for calculation that were

332

detected/perturbed within 200 ms of call onset and with a minimum duration of 800 ms.

333

Consequently, first phee syllables that were interrupted directly after noise onset as

334

previously reported in an earlier study [18] were excluded from further analysis. Second

335

phee syllables were only analyzed if they had a minimum duration of 500 ms. In rare cases,

336

call termination could not be visually detected due to overlapping noise (mostly during the 80

337

dB SPL condition). These calls were also excluded from further analysis.

338

After labelling a call, peak frequencies of the fundamental component were automatically

339

calculated within one-millisecond time bins (8192 FFT, 96 kHz sample rate resulting in a

340

frequency resolution of 11.71 Hz). In cases where the SNR between the call amplitude and

341

playback noise was not high enough for automatic fundamental peak frequency calculation,

342

frequency trajectories were calculated by manually setting call frequencies at several time

343

points and interpolating call frequencies in between the set values. The accuracy of manual

344

labelling compared to automatic calculation of peak frequencies was high and median

345

differences between both techniques below the frequency resolution used (Fig. S1).

346

Call amplitudes were calculated for all phee calls during which the animals did not move

347

their heads during call production. For these calls, head positions were manually labelled by

348

marking the two white ear tufts in the GUI (see Fig. 1B). Next, a perpendicular line starting

349

at the center of the later connection was used to compute angles of the microphones

350

indicating the monkey’s relative head position. The microphone with the smallest angle to

351

the perpendicular line was used for further calculation (Fig. 1B). Calls that were uttered in

352

the rare cases where the angle between the front of the monkey’s head and the microphone

353

was more than 45 degrees were excluded from further analysis. Furthermore, phee calls that

354

were uttered during head movements of the animal were not used for amplitude calculations

355

and only considered for fundamental frequency calculation resulting in a larger data set for

356

frequency analysis.

357

From the recordings of the microphone foremost in front of the animal, call amplitude

358

trajectories (in dB SPL) were calculated using a sliding window approach (window size: 25

359

ms; step length: 1 ms). Sound levels of the recorded playback noise were determined for all

360

conditions and subtracted from the call amplitude measurements taken, using a modification

361

of the spectral noise subtraction method [43]. Briefly, we first calculated an estimate for each

362

noise band by calculating the mean of ten recordings of one noise condition for each

363

microphone. Then, we subtracted this noise estimate in the spectral dimension from noise

364

perturbed parts of a call (i.e., from noise onset to the end of the call) and corrected the

outcome as shown in formula (1), where

According to Berouti et al. [43], we chose alpha0 = 4 and s = 20/3 as a best fit for proper

372

amplitude calculation. A simple empirical test verified the method; a control phee was played

373

and recorded in the recording chamber ten times with broadband noise 70 dB SPL, ten times

374

with a 5–10 kHz noise band and ten times under control conditions (no noise). As reported

375

previously, differences between conditions of <1 dB can be assumed to be negligible [44]. In

376

our case, median differences between control and both noise conditions were below 1 dB

377

(broadband: 0.8 dB, 5–10 kHz noise band: 0.3 dB; Figs. S2A and B) indicating successful

378

performance of the used method. The distance of the animal’s head to the microphone was

379

considered by adding a distance factor directly after noise subtraction to the measurements

380

resulting in a standardized amplitude trajectory (in dB) of each call as produced 10 cm in

381

front of the animal’s head.

382

Frequency/amplitude calculation and normalization. Mean fundamental frequency

383

values were obtained with a sliding window approach (window size: 10 ms, step size: 1 ms).

384

We then calculated the mean of the fundamental frequency in a 20-5 ms time window prior

385

to noise onset (for the noise conditions) and call detection (for the control condition) for each

386

individual call and subtracted this value from each of the frequency values after noise onset.

387

Finally, all values of calls in the noise conditions were normalized by subtracting the mean of

388

the respective frequency value of the control condition. Amplitude values were calculated in

389

a similar way. Here, we also calculated the mean amplitude for each individual call in a 20-5

390

ms time window prior to noise onset and subtracted these values from the mean amplitude

391

values after noise onset. According to the frequency normalization, we then normalized all

392

amplitude values by subtracting the mean of the amplitude values from the corresponding

393

values in the control condition. For the 180 s noise experiment, we used the calculated

394

amplitude values as described above in data analysis.

395

Phee call discrimination models. Marmoset monkeys tend to interrupt their phee calls

396

after the first syllable in response to noise perturbation [18]. For perturbed phee calls, we

397

consequently assumed that a substantial number of single phees had to be interrupted

398

double phees. Recently, it has been shown that single phees and the first syllables of double

399

phees significantly differ in a number of call parameters, such as call frequency and duration

400

[20]. We therefore had to find a way to distinguish single phee calls that were interrupted

401

double phees from original single phees prior to data normalization. To address this, we

402

used the findings of Miller and colleagues [20] that suggested that early peak frequencies

403

and durations of phee calls are sufficient to predict whether a phee call consists out of one or

404

two syllables. Additionally, we found that this is also true for early amplitude values of a call.

405

We applied a quadratic classification model (MATLAB) to discriminate between single and

406

double phees with a two-dimensional classifier for fundamental frequency analysis using 1st

407

syllable durations and peak frequencies at 25 ms after call onset for frequency analyses

408

(Fig. S3). Since we observed that early amplitude values are also a good predictor (Fig. S4),

409

we used a three-dimensional classifier with call amplitude values at 25 ms after call onset as

410

the third measure for amplitude analyses (Fig. S4). Basically, in a first step the mean,

411

and covariance matrix,

Figures

Figure 1: Experimental setup and design. (A) Exemplary spectrograms of single and
double phee calls. (B) The vocal behavior of monkeys was recorded in a soundproof
chamber. The behavior was continuously monitored and recorded. The red line shows the
monkey's head position in relation to the two closest microphones (yellow and black line).
The acoustic signal recorded with the microphone closest to being directly in front of the
monkey’s head (i.e., the smallest angle between the monkey’s perpendicular and the
microphone) was used for amplitude calculation. (C) Relative vocal detection distribution
over time (s). (D) Noise condition overview with masking properties. (E) Exemplary
spectrograms of an interrupted single phee (10–15 kHz noise condition) and unaffected
phee (0.1–5 kHz noise condition).

Figure 2: Increasing frequency shifts in response to noise bursts. Δ call frequency (Hz)
per corresponding noise condition normalized to control data (dashed lines). Mean of
median frequencies after noise onset of each call pooled over all monkeys ± SEM (A) for
first phee syllables 0–800 ms after noise onset (B) for second phee syllables 100–400 ms
after second syllable onset. (C): First syllables mean Δ call frequency courses (Hz) ± SEM of
all amplitude conditions during broadband noise over time after noise onset (ms). Asterisks
denote significant differences.

Figure 4: Hypothetical neuronal model for audio-vocal interaction. Call production might
be affected by ambient noise at different brain levels. Audio-vocal integration mechanisms
are known to happen between cortical and subcortical structures as well as via corticofugal
projections. See text for further explanation.
