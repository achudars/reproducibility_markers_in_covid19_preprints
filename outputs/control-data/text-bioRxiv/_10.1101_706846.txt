Abstract

25

We previously demonstrated that maize (Zea mays) locus very oil yellow1 (vey1) encodes a

26

putative cis-regulatory expression polymorphism at the magnesium chelatase subunit I gene (aka

27

oil yellow1) that strongly modifies the chlorophyll content of the semi-dominant Oy1-N1989

28

mutants. The vey1 allele of Mo17 inbred line reduces chlorophyll content in the mutants leading

29

to reduced photosynthetic output. Oy1-N1989 mutants in B73 reached reproductive maturity four

30

days later than wild-type siblings. Enhancement of Oy1-N1989 by the Mo17 allele at the vey1 QTL

31

delayed maturity further, resulting in detection of a flowering time QTL in two bi-parental

32

mapping populations crossed to Oy1-N1989. The near isogenic lines of B73 harboring the vey1

33

allele from Mo17 delayed flowering of Oy1-N1989 mutants by twelve days. Just as previously

34

observed for chlorophyll content, vey1 had no effect on reproductive maturity in the absence of

35

the Oy1-N1989 allele. Loss of chlorophyll biosynthesis in Oy1-N1989 mutants and enhancement

36

by vey1 reduced CO2 assimilation. We attempted to separate the effects of photosynthesis on the

37

induction of flowering from a possible impact of chlorophyll metabolites and retrograde signaling

38

by manually reducing leaf area. Removal of leaves, independent of the Oy1-N1989 mutant,

39

delayed flowering but surprisingly reduced chlorophyll contents of emerging leaves. Thus,

40

defoliation did not completely separate the identity of the signal(s) that regulates flowering time

41

from changes in chlorophyll content in the foliage. These findings illustrate the necessity to explore

42

the linkage between metabolism and the mechanisms that connect it to flowering time regulation.

Introduction

47

The onset of flowering in angiosperms has been a key focus for plant biologists working on

48

ornamental, horticultural, and other crop species (Lang 1952; Zeevaart 1962; Searle 1965). The

49

onset of reproductive development in angiosperms is affected by a change in meristem identity.

50

The vegetative to floral transition of meristems commits plant development to production of floral

51

organs and sexual reproduction. The integration of signals to correctly time this transition is key

52

to plant fitness. Unsurprisingly, endogenous and environmental cues regulate flowering time

53

(Amasino and Michaels 2010; Cho et al. 2017; Minow et al. 2018). A critical environmental cue

54

is the duration of the light period, or photoperiod. The photoperiodic responses of plants influence

55

the vegetative to floral transition and the mechanisms of this response have been a focus of

56

intensive research for over a century (Klebs, 1918). Multiple non-photoperiodic cues as well as

57

endogenous signals, sometimes called the autonomous pathway, are also critical to floral transition.

58

Endogenous signals, including hormones and the carbohydrate status of the plant, can also play a

59

critical role in the regulation of flowering time (Corbesier et al. 1998; Moghaddam and Ende 2013).

60

But it can be difficult to fully separate endogenous and environmental influences as some

61

environmental factors, such as light quality, alter hormone biosynthesis (Lang 1957; Evans and

62

Poethig 1995; Mutasa-Göttgens and Hedden 2009), and light powers photosynthesis and thereby

63

carbohydrate status (Chen et al. 2004). These stimuli converge through the same floral integrators

64

(named FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and FLOWERING LOCUS D (FD) in Arabidopsis

65

thaliana) for which orthologs have been identified in many flowering plants (Abe et al. 2005;

66

Wigge et al. 2005; Corbesier et al. 2007; Meng et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2016). Accumulation of

67

FT and FD gene products trigger the vegetative shoot apical meristems to acquire the competency

68

to become inflorescence meristems and produce flowers in part via the activation of MADS-box

69

transcription factors that control meristem identity through APETALA1 (Abe et al. 2005; Wigge

70

et al. 2005). In Arabidopsis, FT is regulated by CONSTANS (CO) in response to both circadian

71

regulation and photoperiodic responses, and CO regulates the MADS-box transcription factor

72

SUPPRESSOR OF CONSTANS1 (SOC1) through FT (Samach et al. 2000; Yoo et al. 2005).

73

Maize was domesticated from teosinte (Zea mays ssp. parviglumis or spp. mexicana) in

74

Central America (Doebley et al. 1997; Wang et al. 1999). Strong selection on time to reproductive

75

maturity contributed to the adaptation of maize to different latitudes (Salvi et al. 2007; Huang et

76

al. 2017; Swarts et al. 2017). Flowering of teosinte is promoted by short-day conditions. In contrast,

77

temperate maize germplasm is relatively day-neutral and flowering is primarily under the control

78

of the autonomous pathway (Coles et al. 2010). Mutant studies have identified loci critical to

79

flowering in maize including: indeterminate1 (id1; Colasanti et al. 1998); early phase change (epc;

80

Vega et al. 2002); delayed flowering1 (dlf1; Muszynski et al. 2006); the cis-element polymorphism

81

vegetative transitioning1 (vgt1; Salvi et al. 2007) that regulates a downstream APETALA2-like

82

transcription factor zmrap2.7; zea mays mads4 (zmm4; Danilevskaya et al. 2008); zmcct10 (Hung

83

et al. 2012); zea mays centroradiales8 (zcn8; Meng et al. 2011); zea mays mads1 (zmmads1; Alter

84

et al. 2016); and zea mays mads69 (Liang et al. 2019). Many of these loci encode the maize

85

orthologs of genes identified as regulators of flowering in Arabidopsis. For example, dlf1 and zcn8

86

encode homologs of the Arabidopsis flowering time determinants FD and FT, respectively. id1

87

encodes a zinc-finger transcription factor acting upstream of both DLF1 and ZCN8 (Kozaki et al.

88

2004; Muszynski et al. 2006; Meng et al. 2011). zmm4 is an activator of flowering that is part of

89

a conserved syntenic pair of MADS box genes in the grasses, with zmm24 as the neighboring gene,

90

and encodes one of two maize paralogs of the wheat flowering time and vernalization response

91

locus VRN1 (Danilevskaya et al. 2008). zmm4 acts downstream of dlf1 and id1 in the control of

92

flowering time in maize. zmmads1 is a functional homolog of the Arabidopsis flowering time and

93

circadian rhythm regulator soc1 (Alter et al. 2016). Several QTL studies have used the convenient

94

phenotype of days to reproductive maturity as a proxy for flowering time and identified alleles

95

controlling this trait in maize (Buckler et al. 2009; Coles et al. 2010; Steinhoff et al. 2012; Bouchet

96

et al. 2017). While this trait is convenient it is determined by both the days to floral transition of

97

the meristem and the growth rate of the stem and emergence and maturation of floral structures.

98

Nevertheless, many natural variants controlling days to reproductive maturity in maize map to

99

bona fide flowering time loci identified by mutant studies including alleles of zmmads69, zmcct10,

100

zcn8, dlf1, and vgt1 (Muszynski et al. 2006; Salvi et al. 2007; Meng et al. 2011; Hung et al. 2012;

101

Guo et al. 2018; Liang et al. 2019).

102

One important endogenous signal that contributes to flowering time is the carbohydrate

103

allocation status (Ohto et al. 2001; Seo et al. 2011; Eveland and Jackson 2012; Wahl et al. 2013;

104

Cho et al. 2018). In maize, mutants that are compromised in either sugar export from source tissues

105

or loading sucrose into the phloem flower later than their congenic wild-type siblings (Braun et al.

106

2006; Baker and Braun 2008; Ma et al. 2008; Slewinski et al. 2009; Slewinski and Braun 2010).

107

This is not limited to maize, as starch-deficient Arabidopsis mutants exhibit delayed flowering

108

(Corbesier et al. 1998). Trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P) has been implicated as a reporter of the

109

energy status and Arabidopsis mutants effected in this metabolite also exhibit altered flowering

110

time (Paul 2008; Wahl et al. 2013; Seo et al. 2011). T6P and sucrose are positively correlated, and

111

low levels of T6P results in delayed flowering in Arabidopsis (Wahl et al. 2013). Remarkably, the

112

carbohydrate status and transcriptional regulatory genes controlling flowering time may be directly

113

linked in maize. The id1 flowering time mutants alter carbohydrate partitioning in leaves and

114

accumulate more sucrose and starch (Coneva et al. 2012). As a result, ID1 has been proposed to

115

act as a carbohydrate status sensor that influences flowering time in maize (Coneva, Zhu, and

116

Colasanti 2007; Minow et al. 2018). Remarkably, the promoter of the T6P biosynthetic gene

117

trehalose 6-phosphate synthase1 (tps1) is a predicted target of the ID1 DNA-binding protein and

118

low levels of T6P were observed in id1 mutants (Minow et al. 2018).

119

If sugars are critical for floral transitioning in plants, then manipulation of photosynthesis

120

should alter flowering. Magnesium chelatase (MgChl) is a hetero-oligomeric enzyme complex

121

comprised of subunits I, D, and H. This enzyme catalyzes the first committed step of chlorophyll

122

biosynthesis by conversion of protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) into magnesium-PPIX (Walker and

123

Weinstein 1991; Gibson et al. 1995). The I subunit of MgChl is encoded by oil yellow1 (oy1) in

124

maize (Sawers et al. 2006). The OY1-N1989 mutant protein carries a L176F amino acid

125

substitution that results in the protein acting as a competitive inhibitor of MgChl complex function,

126

and decouples ATPase and Mg2+ chelatase activity (Hansson et al. 1999, 2002; Sawers et al. 2006).

127

As a result, homozygous Oy1-N1989 mutants are seedling lethal with no chlorophyll accumulation

128

but are viable to reproductive maturity in heterozygous condition (Sawers et al. 2006, Khangura

129

et al. 2019).

130

We previously identified a cis-acting expression polymorphism at the oy1 locus associated

131

with a QTL called very oil yellow1 (vey1) that modifies the chlorophyll content of semi-dominant

132

Oy1-N1989 mutants (Khangura et al. 2019). The vey1 QTL was proposed to modulate the

133

chlorophyll content of heterozygous Oy1-N1989/+ mutants via cis-regulatory differences resulting

134

in differential accumulation of the product encoded by the wild-type allele at oy1. The Mo17 allele

135

at vey1 (vey1Mo17) was associated with lower abundance of OY1 transcripts, whereas the B73 allele

136

at vey1 (vey1B73) is associated with higher accumulation of OY1. The effect of vey1 on chlorophyll

137

content is only visible in the presence of Oy1-N1989, indicating that this natural variant has a

138

cryptic effect on the function of the MgChl complex.

139

In this study, we used controlled crosses to segregate Oy1-N1989 and the modifier alleles at

140

vey1 (vey1B73 and vey1Mo17) to generate populations of maize with a range of chlorophyll contents.

141

We used this variation in chlorophyll to explore the effects of chlorophyll content on net CO2

142

assimilation. These changes in chlorophyll accumulation resulted in changes in net CO2

143

assimilation and photosynthetically-fixed carbon accumulation. Remarkably, we noticed that

144

flowering time across material with differing photosynthetic rates and chlorophyll contents was

145

dramatically different. We observed that reduced chlorophyll accumulation was associated with a

146

delay in flowering time. Similar to the cryptic effects of vey1 on chlorophyll content, the modifier

147

allele had no effect on flowering time in the absence of the Oy1-N1989 mutant allele. Chlorophyll

148

content was consistently associated with earlier flowering and partial rescue of chlorophyll

149

accumulation in the Oy1-N1989 mutant by the vey1 QTL accelerated flowering in the mutants but

150

had no effect on wild-type siblings. In addition to measurements of net CO2 assimilation, the

151

premature senescence of maize leaves, induced by sugar accumulation following sink removal,

152

was also reduced by Oy1-N1989 and further reduced by vey1 alleles that decrease chlorophyll

153

content and net CO2 assimilation. The effect of reduced photosynthate accumulation on flowering

154

time was not specific to Oy1-N1989 as mechanical removal of leaves, to reduce plant leaf area,

155

also delayed flowering time. Thus, all of our results are consistent with an integrative measure of

156

carbon assimilation linking energy status and flowering time in maize.

siblings (Khangura et al. 2019). The B73 introgressed stock of Oy1-N1989 was used for crossing

162

to various mapping populations. A total of 216 intermated B73 × Mo17 population (IBM-RILs),

163

and 251 synthetic 10 doubled haploid lines (Syn10-DH) were crossed as ear-parents with Oy1-

164

N1989/+:B73 pollen. The pollen of Oy1-N1989/+:B73 plants were also crossed on to the ears of

165

35 B73-Mo17 near-isogenic lines (BM-NILs) for QTL validation. Tables S1-S3 contain the full

166

list of IBM-RILs, Syn10-DH, and BM-NILs used to develop F1 hybrid populations.

167

Field trials

168

All of the field experiments described in this study were conducted at the Purdue Agronomy Center

169

for Research and Education (ACRE) in West Lafayette, Indiana. Each cross was evaluated as a

170

single plot of 12-16 plants. Each plot derived from crosses with Oy1-N1989/+:B73 tester

171

segregated for both mutant and wild-type siblings in approximately 1:1 ratio. Seeds were sown

172

with a tractor-driven seed planter with plot length of 3.84 meters (m), alley length of 0.79 m, and

173

inter-row spacing of 0.79 m. Standard crop management practices at Purdue in terms of fertilizer,

174

pest, and weed control for growing field maize were adopted.

175

Each experiment was divided into blocks. Progenies from crosses of B73 and Mo17 ears to

176

Oy1-N1989/+:B73 pollen were used as parental checks in each block. Parental checks were

177

randomized within each block. The IBM-RILs F1 populations were evaluated as a single

178

replication in 2013. Syn10-DH F1 populations were evaluated in 2016 with two full replications

179

planted in randomized complete block design (RCBD). Hybrid progenies of Oy1-N1989/+:B73

180

with BM-NILs were screened in 2016 with five replications planted in RCBD.

Field phenotyping and data collection

182

The mutant plants in each plot were identified visually as pale plants. The chlorophyll content in

183

mutant and wild-type plants was approximated using a CCM-200 plus (Opti-Sciences Inc., Hudson,

184

NH) as described in Khangura et al. 2019. We previously demonstrated correlation of 0.94

185

between CCM-200 plus values and chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and total chlorophyll contents

186

(Khangura et al. 2019), and therefore used CCM-200 plus values (CCM) as a proxy for chlorophyll

187

content in the materials described here. CCMI refers to measurements taken with the CCM-200

188

plus instrument from 25-30 days after sowing and CCMII refers to measurements taken 45-50 days

189

after sowing. Mutants were tagged between the V5-V7 stages of development. Tagging is

190

necessary as suppression of the Oy1-N1989 mutant phenotype by vey1 interferes with visual

191

classification of mutant and wild-type siblings at maturity. Reproductive maturity in each F1

192

population was recorded separately on the wild-type and mutant plants. The date at which roughly

193

half of the wild-type or mutant plants in a given plot were shedding pollen and had emerging silks

194

from the primary ear was recorded as the date of anthesis and date of silking, respectively, for a

195

given genotype. The dates of anthesis and silking for both wild-type and mutant genotypes were

196

then subtracted from the date of planting to obtain respective wild-type or mutant days to anthesis

197

(DTA), and days to silking (DTS). Further, the difference between DTA and DTS was used to

198

derive the anthesis-silking interval (ASI); ASI = DTA-DTS. Wild-type and mutant trait values are

199

denoted with a prefix WT and MT, respectively. Ratio and differences of these flowering time

200

traits were also calculated as MT/WT and WT-MT, respectively.

201

A total of 15 F1 populations derived from B73-like NILs × Oy1-N1989/+:B73 cross were

202

used to study induced leaf senescence. Seven of these B73-like NILs carried an introgression of

203

vey1 from Mo17 (vey1Mo17), whereas the other eight NILs had the B73 genotype at vey1 (vey1B73).

204

These NIL populations were planted in the field with at least two replications of each genotype

205

planted in RCBD and two times separated by two weeks. The procedure for this experiment was

206

adapted from Sekhon et al. 2012. Briefly, primary and secondary ears of both wild-type and mutant

207

plants were covered with shoot bags before silk emergence. After 3-4 days of tassel shedding,

208

roughly half of the shoot bags were removed, and these ears were allowed to open pollinate.

209

Staggered rows of B73, in addition to the pollen shed within the row fully pollinated exposed ears.

210

The day of shoot exposure was marked as 0 days after anthesis (DAA). Photographs were taken

211

on the same date using plants from both planting dates to permit display of differences in the effect

212

of DAA on phenotype severity.

213

Genotypic and gene expression data

214

The genotypic data and other public datasets on various mapping populations used in this

215

study have been described previously (Khangura et al. 2019). Briefly, the public marker dataset

216

for IBM-RILs was obtained from MaizeGDB with 2,178 markers (Sen et al. 2010). The markers

217

were reduced to 2,156 after removing duplicate variants, with ~13.3 percent of missing data in the

218

final dataset. Genotypic data consisting of 6611 SNPs for Syn10-DH lines was obtained from Liu

219

et al. 2015. This dataset had no missing genotypes and was used as such for QTL analyses.

220

Genotypes of the B73-Mo17 Near Isogenic Lines (BM-NILs) used for QTL validation were

221

obtained from Eichten et al. 2011. Expression data of oy1 locus in IBM-RILs were obtained from

222

a public repository of the National Science Foundation grant (GEPR: Genomic Analyses of shoot

Allele-specific expression (ASE) assay

229

Three replications of B73-Mo17 near-isogenic lines (BM-NILs) × Oy1-N1989/+:B73 F1 progenies

230

were grown in the field. Mutant siblings derived from four B73-like NILs crossed with Oy1-

231

N1989/+:B73 were selected for the ASE experiment. These NILs consisted of two B73-like NILs

232

(b094 and b189) with vey1Mo17, and other two B73-like NILs (b135 and b185) with vey1B73

233

genotype. Leaf tissue was harvested from the top fully-expanded leaf at the V3 developmental

234

stage from the mutant siblings of the four B73-like NIL F1 plots. For each biological replicate,

235

tissue was pooled from 4-5 seedlings to make one sample. The samples were stored at -80 ˚C until

236

needed. The procedure of total RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and the ASE assay has been

237

described previously in detail (Khangura et al. 2019). Briefly, one µg of DNase treated total RNA

238

was used to synthesize cDNA. PCR was conducted using the forward oligonucleotide 5’-

polymerization (94˚C for 30s, 56˚C for 30s, 72 ˚C for 30s and final extension for 2 minutes) to

242

amplify the targeted region of OY1. The primer pair used in this assay flanked the SNP that causes

243

the L176F amino acid substitution in the Oy1-N1989 mutant allele. PCR products were sequenced

244

on a MiSeq instrument (Illumina, San Diego, CA) at the Purdue Genomics Core Facility. Reads

245

were aligned to a small reference sequence of B73 derived from targeted PCR region using the

GATK packages (DePristo et al. 2011). Read counts derived from GATK was used to calculate

allele-specific expression. Genomic DNA derived from B73 × Mo17 F1 hybrids resulted in roughly

Statistical analyses

250

Exploratory data analysis was done using JMP 13.0 (SAS Institute Inc. 2016). The pairwise

251

correlations were calculated using the Pearson correlation coefficient. The average values of

252

various traits from line-cross populations, IBM-RILs and Syn10-DH, were subjected to QTL

253

analyses. QTL detection was done using a single interval mapping via the EM algorithm using the

254

function “scanone” in R/qtl, a software package implemented in R (Broman et al. 2003; R core

255

Team 2013). Similar results were obtained with composite interval mapping function “cim” in

256

R/qtl (data not shown).

257

Defoliation assay

258

The defoliation experiments were performed using maize inbred B73, sorghum (Sorghum bicolor)

259

inbred BTx623, and green foxtail (Setaria viridis) inbred A10.1. These experiments were

260

conducted in a greenhouse using mogul base high-pressure sodium lamps (1000 Watts) as the

261

supplemental light source for L:D cycle of 16:8 hours, with the temperature set at 28ºC (day-time)

262

and 20ºC (night-time). The maize inbred line B73 was defoliated at V3 leaf stage. All the leaves

263

with a fully visible leaf collar were cut slightly above the ligule. Sorghum plants with three to four

264

fully opened leaves (~20 days after sowing in the greenhouse) were defoliated in a similar way.

265

All fully expanded leaves at ~15 days after planting, including those on tillers, were removed in

266

Setaria plants. The time to reproductive maturity of both defoliated and undisturbed controls was

267

recorded on maize as described above. For sorghum and Setaria, the date of head emergence,

268

rather than anthesis, on every plant was recorded and deducted from the date of planting to obtain

269

days to heading.

Non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) quantification

271

The soluble sugars and starch were quantified from the mutant siblings of four B73-NILs × Oy1-

272

N1989/+:B73 F1 population. Two of these NILs carried vey1Mo17, while the other two had vey1B73

273

genotype. Plants were grown in the field with three replications using a RCBD. The top fully-

274

expanded leaf at the V3 stage was harvested at 1:00 PM and transferred to liquid nitrogen. Leaf

275

tissues were stored at -80°C until needed. Leaf samples were ground into a fine powder and ~100

276

mg of the powder was used to extract sucrose, glucose, fructose, and starch using a previously

277

described method (Leach and Braun 2016). The quantification of these NSC was done using a

278

previously described method (Leach et al. 2017). Briefly, high-performance anion exchange

279

(HPAE) chromatography (ICS-5000, Thermo-Fisher Scientific) was used to analyze the neutral

280

fraction of the extract. Sugar standards were used to construct a standard curve, and samples were

281

diluted to ensure that the detected values fell within the scope of this curve.

282

Gas-exchange measurements

283

Gas-exchange measurements were taken on field-grown plants during the summer of 2017 at the

284

Purdue ACRE farm. The gas-exchange measurements were taken on the third leaf on plants at the

285

V3 stage between 11 AM and 1 PM using a LICOR LI-6400XT open photosynthesis system (LI-

286

COR Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). The F1 progenies used for these measurements consisted of four

287

independent B73-NILs × Oy1-N1989/+:B73 cross, in which two NILs carried vey1Mo17

288

introgression and the other two carried vey1B73 allele. Plants were grown in a RCBD of three

289

replicated blocks. For each genotype, nine plants were measured as three replicates in each of the

290

three blocks. The following instrument conditions were maintained throughout the measurement

291

period: an artificial light source with an intensity of 1700 µmol photosynthetically active radiation

(PAR) m-2 s-1, air temperature of ~31 ºC, CO2 concentration of 400 mL L-1, air flow of 400 µmol

293

s-1, and relative humidity of 50-60%. Leaf temperatures varied from 32-34ºC during the

294

measurements.

295

Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements were taken on the same leaves used for gas-

296

exchange using a Handy PEA (Hansatech Instruments Ltd., Norfolk, UK). Leaves were dark-

297

adapted for 20-30 min using leaf clips before taking measurements. The saturation pulse rate of

298

3000 µmol m-2 s-1 was used to measure the emission of chlorophyll fluorescence. The initial

299

chlorophyll fluorescence yield (F0), the variable chlorophyll fluorescence yield (Fv), and the

300

maximum chlorophyll fluorescence yield (Fm) were recorded. The maximum photochemical

301

efficiency of PSII in dark-adapted leaves was obtained by calculating the ratio of Fv/Fm.

Results

309

Negative effect of Oy1-N1989 on time to reproductive maturity is exacerbated by Mo17

310

While preparing the material for our previous study (Khangura et al. 2019), we noticed that Oy1-

311

N1989 exhibited a consistent delay in flowering, as measured by the days to silking and days to

312

pollen anthesis. Heterozygous Oy1-N1989 mutant plants in the Mo17 × B73 hybrid genetic

background flower up to two-weeks later than wild-type siblings (Figure 1; Table S4). The Oy1-

314

N1989 mutants also flower later in an isogenic inbred B73 background; however, the delay is only

315

four days. By contrast, wild-type B73 × Mo17 F1 hybrid plants flower earlier than the wild-type

316

B73 inbred plants. Maize is protandrous and tassels mature earlier than the ear-inflorescence. The

317

effect of Oy1-N1989 and flowering time was similar for both anthesis and silk emergence. The

318

window of difference in maturity of the tassel and ear inflorescence, measured as anthesis-silking

319

interval (ASI), is used as an indicator of plant stress in maize (Bolanos and Edmeades 1996). The

320

ASI was wider in the wild-type siblings compared to the mutants in Mo17 × B73 hybrid

321

background (Figure 1G) and not discernably different in the B73 inbred background. Thus, the

322

delay in flowering does not seem to be due to a generic stress effect due to lower chlorophyll

323

contents.

Delayed reproductive maturity of Oy1-N1989 mutants in B73 × Mo17 mapping populations

325

maps to vey1

326

If the effect of genetic background on flowering time in Oy1-N1989 mutants is due to variation in

327

the accumulation of chlorophyll, we expect that the previously described vey1 QTL from Mo17

328

should make this more severe (Khangura et al. 2019). To identify the genetic basis of the flowering

329

time variation in Oy1-N1989 mutants and test the effect of vey1, we recorded flowering time in

330

wild-type and mutant F1 progenies from the crosses between Oy1-N1989/+:B73 pollen-parent with

331

IBM-RILs and Syn10-DH lines. Hereafter, the hybrid populations developed from these crosses

332

will be referred to as the IBM-RILs F1 and Syn10-DH F1 populations (Figure 2).

333

Pairwise correlations were calculated between previously reported chlorophyll index

334

measures (Khangura et al. 2019) and flowering time traits collected from the same plots (Tables

335

S5 and S6). The chlorophyll index was measured at two time points CCMI (25-30 days after

336

sowing) and CCMII (45-50 days after sowing). In the IBM-RILs crosses, wild-type CCMII

337

displayed a weak but significant negative correlation with wild-type DTA and DTS. Similarly, in

338

the Syn10-DH crosses wild-type CCMI displayed a significant weak negative correlation with

339

wild-type DTA and DTS. This indicates that the phenomena observed in our mutants, reduced

340

chlorophyll content associated with a delay in flowering time was true in the wild-type populations

341

as well, but much less obvious. The variation in chlorophyll content in wild-type plants was not

342

predictive of either mutant CCM or flowering time in the mutants (Figure 3, Table S5, and S6)

343

indicating that the variation in CCM was not under the same control in the mutant and wild-type

344

subpopulations. A dramatic and obvious negative correlation was observed between CCM trait

345

values (CCMI and CCMII) and flowering time in the mutant siblings in both IBM-RILs and

346

Syn10-DH F1 populations. As was observed in the Oy1-N1989/+ B73 inbred stock and B73 ×

347

Mo17 hybrids Oy1-N1989/+ mutants, mutants in these test-cross populations also showed a clear

348

increase in mean values for days to anthesis and silking compared to wild-type siblings (Figure 4).

349

The frequency distribution plot of days to anthesis in mutant siblings of IBM-RILs and

350

Syn10-DH F1 populations displayed a bimodal distribution, suggesting a single polymorphic locus

351

segregating between B73 and Mo17 was the basis of flowering time variation in Oy1-N1989

352

mutants (Figure 5). QTL mapping detected a single QTL on chromosome 10 at similar linkage

353

positions for all mutant derived flowering traits (Figure 5; Tables S7 and S8). This corresponds to

354

the vey1 locus that we previously described as a major-effect QTL that controls chlorophyll

355

biosynthesis only in the presence of the Oy1-N1989 allele (Khangura et al. 2019). QTL mapping

for various direct and derived mutant flowering time traits such as days to flower in the mutant

heterozygotes (MT_DTA and MT_DTS), ratio of days to flower derived from mutant and wild-

359

type and mutant siblings (Diff_DTA and Diff_DTS) all detected vey1 in both mapping populations

360

and exceeding permutation-estimated significance thresholds (alpha<0.05). The vey1 QTL

361

explained ~40-48% of the phenotypic variation for these flowering traits in the IBM-RIL crosses,

362

and >65% variation in Syn10-DH F1 crosses. As expected, the Oy1-N1989 enhancing vey1Mo17

363

allele was associated with a delay in flowering time in the mutant hybrid siblings (Tables S7 and

364

S8). In addition to vey1, an additional QTL controlling both mutant anthesis and silking was

365

detected in the Syn10-DH F1 population on chromosome 2 which we call other oil yellow1

366

flowering time locus1 (oof1). This QTL explained ~7-8% variation in flowering time with the

367

Mo17 allele at this locus resulting in a delay of 2-3 days in reproductive maturity of mutant siblings.

368

Because of the very large effect of vey1, and the mild segregation distortion at this locus in

369

both bi-parental populations (Khangura et al. 2019), weak QTL might be detected by spurious

370

linkage between chr2 and chr10 markers. To test this, we carried out multiple regressions using

371

top markers at oof1 and vey1 as independent variables and mutant DTA in the Syn10-DH as a

372

dependent variable (data not shown). In this analysis, both vey1 and oof1 remained significant

373

factors in the multiple regression and explained 62% and 2% of the variance in flowering time,

374

respectively. Inclusion of a vey1 × oof1 interaction term did not improve the fit of the model, did

375

not eliminate the significance of the oof1 term, and the interaction term was not a significant

376

variable. Moreover, we did not detect additional QTL by including these as covariates in an

377

additional genome-wide scan. Therefore, we propose that oof1 is a novel QTL contingent upon the

378

Oy1-N1989 mutation and genetically independent of vey1.

379

The ASI of mutant and wild-type siblings in the test cross populations were not discernably

380

different, just as we observed in the mutant parents. QTL mapping for this trait did not detect any

381

loci controlling ASI in either the mutants or the wild type siblings. In addition, we did not detect

18
382

any QTL for flowering time in wild-type siblings (Tables S7 and S8). Thus, Oy1-N1989 was

383

epistatic to both vey1 and oof1 QTLs suggesting a role for each locus in controlling either

384

photosynthesis or chlorophyll metabolites in the regulation of flowering time.

385

We further validated the effect of the vey1 critical region using a set of NIL that vary at the

386

vey1 QTL from the recurrent background. F1 progeny of these NIL and Oy1-N1989/+ produced

387

matched wild-type and Oy1-N1989/+ heterozygous mutant NIL F1 hybrids. The vey1Mo17 allele

388

delayed flowering time in Oy1-N1989/+ mutants crossed to both B73 and Mo17 recurrent

389

backgrounds when compared to NILs carrying vey1B73 (Figure 6, Figure S3, and Table S3). No

390

effect of vey1 introgression from either parent was visible on the flowering traits of the wild-type

391

siblings. The reproductive maturity of mutant B73-like NILs carrying vey1Mo17, and reciprocal

392

introgression of vey1B73 into Mo17 background displayed the opposite effect on flowering time in

393

the F1 mutants (Figure 6). Thus, these results clearly show the single locus effect of vey1 on

394

flowering time in maize in Oy1-N1989-contingent manner in both isogenic inbred (B73) and

395

hybrid (Mo17 × B73) background.

396

Expression polymorphism in B73-like NILs is consistent with cis-acting regulatory

397

polymorphism at vey1

398

Our previous study looking at the suppression of Oy1-N1989 mutant phenotype using chlorophyll

399

accumulation identified a cis-eQTL at oy1 in the IBM-RILs population (Khangura et al. 2019).

400

Normalized expression (expressed as RPKM) of OY1 derived from 14 days old shoot apices of

401

IBM-RILs (Li et al., 2013; 2018) were used for this analysis. The top marker, isu085b, used in the

402

detection of this cis-eQTL was also one of the top significant markers for mutant flowering time

403

traits (Figure S1 and Table S9). Regression of OY1 expression and flowering traits collected in

404

IBM-RILs F1 population identified a significant linear relationship between gene expression in

405

wild-type inbred lines and flowering time measurements from mutant F1 siblings (Figure S2 and

406

Table S9). Roughly 21% of the variation in mutant DTA could be explained by OY1 expression

407

in the IBM-RILs shoot apices. OY1 expression did not predict any variation in wild-type DTA.

408

The allele specific-expression (ASE) assay in our previous study identified bias in expression

409

with the wild-type oy1 allele from Mo17 displaying lower expression than the wild-type oy1 allele

410

from B73 (Khangura et al. 2019). Our previous ASE work compared mutant plants in two different

411

genetic backgrounds (inbred vs hybrid) which can complicate the interpretations. To overcome

412

this limitation, an ASE assay was designed to test bias at oy1 using near-isogenic lines in the B73

413

background. These B73-like NILs consisted of two independent NILs with vey1Mo17 introgression,

414

and two independent NILs with B73 genotype at vey1. Consistent with the previous ASE results,

415

a significantly greater proportion of expression was derived from the Oy1-N1989 mutant allele

416

when the wild-type oy1 allele was contributed by vey1Mo17 introgression as compared to the

417

isogenic mutant siblings carrying the wild-type oy1 allele from vey1B73 introgression (Table S10).

418

Net CO2 assimilation and sugar metabolism is reduced in Oy1-N1989 mutants in vey1-

419

dependent manner

420

We measured net CO2 assimilation, sub-stomatal CO2, photosystem II fluorescence, and

421

photosynthate accumulation in enhanced and suppressed Oy1-N1989/+ mutants. A previous study

422

in maize has shown that reduction in chlorophyll levels in the leaves leads to a reduction in

423

photosynthetic rate (Huang et al. 2009). A similar reduction in photosynthetic rate should be

424

displayed by Oy1-N1989 mutants and the Mo17 allele should show a greater reduction in

425

photosynthesis compared to the B73 allele. We tested this using F1 progenies derived from the

426

same four B73-like NILs used for the ASE experiment. The negative effect of vey1Mo17

427

introgression on chlorophyll accumulation was visible in the Oy1-N1989 mutant allele background

428

(Figure 6). As expected, photosynthetic rate (A) was reduced in mutants as compared to wild-type

429

siblings, and mutants were modified further by the vey1 genotype (Table 1). Photosystem II

430

efficiency (Fv/Fm) measurements indicated higher photo-oxidative damage to the photosystem in

431

enhanced mutant plants compared to the suppressed mutants. Wild-type siblings of all four B73-

432

like NIL F1 progenies showed no statistically significant difference for chlorophyll and gas-

433

exchange measurements. This indicates that, just as for chlorophyll content, the vey1 QTL affects

434

net CO2 assimilation in the presence of the Oy1-N1989 mutant allele. No differences in stomatal

435

conductance (gs) or transpiration (E) were observed in the mutant plants, however, severe mutant

436

plants showed significantly higher accumulation of intracellular CO2 (Ci) compared to the

437

suppressed mutants suggesting the failure of the enhanced mutant plants to uptake CO2 (Table 1).

438

These differences in photosynthetic rate should result in a decrease of non-structural

439

carbohydrate accumulation in the photosynthetic leaf tissue. The levels of non-structural

440

carbohydrates were determined from leaves of the same mutant plants that were used for gas-

441

exchange measurements. Levels of sucrose, glucose, fructose, and starch were measured in these

442

samples. All of these showed a significant reduction in the enhanced mutants compared to the

443

suppressed mutants in the B73 isogenic background (Figure 7 and Table S11). Lower levels of

444

sugars and starch in the Oy1-N1989/+ mutant heterozygotes enhanced by a vey1Mo17 allele is

445

consistent with the observation of lower chlorophyll levels and photosynthetic rates in these

446

genotypes compared to the suppressed mutant NILs.

447

Defoliation of Zea mays, Sorghum bicolor, and Setaria viridis delays reproductive maturity

448

The existing literature suggests sugars and carbohydrate metabolism play an important role in

449

regulating flowering time in plants (Ohto et al. 2001; Seo et al. 2011; Wahl et al. 2013). We

450

hypothesized that removal of source tissue should mimic the sugar starvation observed in Oy1-

451

N1989 mutants. We used mechanical defoliation to reduce photosynthetic surplus of the plant. The

452

choice of this treatment was intended to deprive plants of leaf area and photosynthate early in

453

development to separate the block in chlorophyll biosynthesis and the loss of photosynthate, which

454

are coupled in the Oy1-N1989 mutant study. We conducted this experiment using wild-type inbred

455

strains of maize and two other monocot species: Sorghum bicolor (sorghum) and Setaria viridis

456

(green foxtail). Each species was defoliated at an early vegetative stage when only few leaves had

457

fully expanded. Defoliation delayed flowering in all three species (Figure 8). Maize, sorghum, and

458

green foxtail displayed a delay in flowering by about 13, 7, and 4 days, respectively, compared to

459

the control plants. Remarkably, one-week post-defoliation, newly-emerged leaves displayed a pale

460

leaf color. Chlorophyll estimation using CCM found a reduction in the leaf greenness in the

461

defoliated treatments compared to the control samples (Figure 8). The newly-emerged leaves of

462

defoliated maize, sorghum, and green foxtail showed ~35%, ~48%, and ~58% reduction in CCM,

463

respectively, compared to control plants. Subsequent leaves emerging from the defoliated plants

464

displayed normal leaf color suggesting recovery of the plants from defoliation. We propose that

465

early season defoliation results in the removal of source tissue that might be critical for vegetative

466

to floral transition in grasses but a direct effect of chlorophyll accumulation cannot be ruled out.

467

Leaf senescence is suppressed by Oy1-N1989 mutants in a vey1-dependent manner

468

Leaf senescence can be induced in maize by sucrose accumulation in the leaves. This can be

469

accomplished genetically by disrupting sucrose transport (Braun et al. 2006; Baker and Braun

470

2008; Slewinski et al. 2009) or by preventing the maize ears from acting as a sink (Allison and

471

Weinmann 1970; Sekhon et al. 2012, 2019). Previous studies have shown that maize leaf

472

senescence caused by pollination prevention or ear removal before pollination is genotype-

473

dependent (Ceppi et al. 1987). We tested the effect of sugar accumulation in mutant B73-like NILs

474

on induced leaf senescence by pollination prevention. Given the variation in leaf sugar in Oy1-

475

N1989/+ (Figure 7) we expect the mutants exhibit less or later senescence following pollination

476

prevention and modulation of this effect by vey1. We observed that 30 days-after-anthesis (DAA),

477

the top leaves of unpollinated wild-type B73 plants showed complete senescence with only a few

478

green patches. Unpollinated Oy1-N1989/+ F1 mutant plants crossed to the vey1B73 NIL background

479

were green and showed only a few patches of anthocyanin accumulation and cell death on the top

480

leaves at 30 DAA (Figure 9 and Table S12). Consistent with the lower chlorophyll and NSC

481

accumulation, unpollinated Oy1-N1989/+ mutant F1 plants crossed to the B73 NIL background

482

containing the vey1Mo17 introgression did not show any sign of leaf senescence at 30 DAA. By 42

483

DAA, unpollinated Oy1-N1989/+ mutants with the vey1B73 allele and all unpollinated wild-type

484

plants showed leaf senescence. Even at 42 DAA, the enhancement of Oy1-N1989/+ by the

485

vey1Mo17 allele resulted in substantially less cell death and anthocyanin accumulation.

486

Discussion

487

Our previous work identified a modifier, vey1, that affects the chlorophyll accumulation in Oy1-

488

N1989/+ heterozygotes (Khangura et al. 2019). The vey1 polymorphism(s) are common natural

489

variant(s) linked to the oy1 locus of maize. We proposed that vey1 results from cis-acting

490

regulatory polymorphisms that affect the expression of OY1. The suppression of the mutant, and

491

accumulation of chlorophyll, follows the proportion of wild-type and mutant transcript levels

492

(Table S10 and Khangura et al. 2019). In this work, we describe a delay in reproductive maturity

493

in the Oy1-N1989 mutants and demonstrate that vey1 encodes a strong modifying QTL altering

494

the flowering time of mutant siblings in all mapping populations (Figures 5 and 6; Tables S7 and

496

background, there was no effect of the vey1 genotype on flowering time in wild-type siblings. We

497

observed the same marker, isu085b, had the strongest effect on chlorophyll content, OY1 transcript

498

abundance in shoot apices (Khangura et al. 2019), and variation in flowering time of IBM-RILs ×

499

Oy1-N1989/+ mutant F1 mutant siblings (Table S9 and Figure S2). Taking these observations

500

together, we propose that the cis-acting eQTL at oy1 is affecting chlorophyll level in Oy1-N1989

501

mutants, and that the alteration in photosynthesis through perturbed chlorophyll metabolism

502

affects flowering time variation in mutant siblings in these populations.

503

Our previous work on vey1 has focused on the cryptic nature of the variation, and the

504

interaction between the vey1 QTL and the Oy1-N1989 mutant allele. The experiments presented

505

here also suggest chlorophyll content as a heretofore unappreciated correlate of flowering time in

506

wild-type maize plants (Figure 3; Tables S5 and S6). We observed that CCM values in both test

507

cross populations, were negatively correlated with wild-type days to reproductive maturity. This

508

suggests a role for the determinants of variation in chlorophyll contents in regulation of flowering

509

time in maize perhaps via changes to photosynthetic output or signaling. As no QTL were detected

510

for CCM in the wild-type siblings in our previous work (Khangura et al. 2019), it also suggests

511

that the mechanism responsible for the covariation between CCM and flowering time is

512

independent of vey1. This is further strengthened by the absence of an effect of vey1 on flowering

513

time in the wild-type siblings in our mapping populations and NIL experiments (Table S3 and

514

Figure S3). Further experiments are required to validate or reject a causal relationship between

515

CCM and flowering time in wild-type siblings. Experiments using populations with greater

516

recombination or allelic diversity, such as in an association panel, should disrupt most fortuitous

517

linkage and would provide a second test of this phenotypic correlation and either argue for or

518

against additional exploration of this relationship. The crosses of Oy1-N1989/+ to the association

519

panel analyzed for CCM in a previous study (Khangura et al. 2019) could be replanted and

520

measured for flowering time of wild-type and Oy1-N1989/+ mutant sibling pairs. Candidate gene

521

testing of epistatic interactions between Oy1-N1989, vey1, and the known flowering time

522

regulators segregating in that population (e.g. zmmads69, cct10, zcn8, dlf1, and vgt1) could provide

523

some insight. Epistasis, indicating interaction between chlorophyll biosynthetic disruption and

524

developmental determinants of the transition to flowering, would be consistent with

525

photosynthesis acting as part of the autonomous pathway whereas no genetic interaction would be

526

consistent with the slow growth of plant organs in a compromised background resulting in the

527

observed reproductive delays.

528

Even though the Syn10-DH and IBM-RILs are derived from the same parents, they differ in

529

the method of development and rates of recombination (Liu et al. 2015; Hussain et al. 2007; Lee

530

et al. 2002). Thus, these two populations yield different levels of resolution for QTL detection.

531

Our previous analysis to fine map vey1 QTL using CCM values showed Syn10-DH to have a

532

higher mapping resolution than the IBM-RILs population (Khangura et al. 2019). We also

533

observed different QTL for flowering time in these populations. QTL analysis in Syn10-DH F1

534

population detected the oof1 QTL on chromosome 2 affecting MT_DTA and MT_DTS as well as

535

the major-effect locus vey1 (Table S8). The detection of oof1 was dependent on the presence of

536

the Oy1-N1989 mutant, but was neither contingent nor displayed any epistatic interactions with

537

vey1. Thus, oof1 appears to be a novel locus of independent mechanism affecting flowering time

538

in the Oy1-N1989 mutants. This QTL on chromosome 2 was not detected for any other trait in the

539

Syn10-DH and IBM-RILs testcross populations with Oy1-N1989/+:B73 in the current study nor

540

was it identified as a modifier of chlorophyll content in our previous study (Khangura et al. 2019).

541

The amount of phenotypic variation explained by vey1 in flowering time was higher in the Syn10-

542

DH experimental material than the IBM-RILs testcross population by ~20% (Tables S7 and S8).

543

Greater variation in flowering time in the IBM-RILs testcross progenies that could not be modeled

544

by marker genotypes may result from higher residual heterozygosity or greater rates of pollen

545

contamination during the single seed descent (SSD) procedure used to generate the IBM-RILs

546

(Lee et al. 2002). Heterozygosity is expected to be negligible in Syn10-DH population because of

547

the DH procedure employed to fix allele segregation during population development (Hussain et

548

al. 2007). In addition, we had a moderate increase in sample size in the Syn10-DH (251 lines) as

549

compared to the IBM-RILs (216 lines) that is expected to result in a marginally greater power to

550

detect QTL in the Syn10-DH F1 populations.

551

Chlorophyll levels are correlated with the rate of photosynthesis in plants (Huang et al. 2009).

552

Some controversy has been reported in mutants of soybean affected in an ortholog of oy1 with

553

some reports showing little impact on photosynthesis (Sakowska et al. 2018) and others clearly

554

demonstrating a linear relationship between chlorophyll variation and photosynthesis (Walker et

555

al. 2017). The reasons for conflicting conclusions results from soybean mutants are not fully clear

556

but it warrants some caution in making simplistic interpretations about the impact of chlorophyll

557

deficient mutants on photosynthesis. In our study, net CO2 assimilation was associated with the

558

severity of the Oy1-N1989 mutant phenotype. The effect of chlorophyll loss on CO2 assimilation

559

measurements using a LICOR instrument was somewhat non-linear. A nearly 5-fold reduction in

560

CCM in Oy1-N1989 NILs carrying a B73 allele at vey1 resulted in in a 22% reduction in net CO2

561

assimilation while the 10-fold reduction in CCM in Oy1-N1989 NILs carrying a Mo17 allele at

562

vey1 resulted in a 64% reduction in net photosynthetic rate, compared to their isogenic wild-type

563

siblings (Table 1). Ultimately, both reductions resulted in less accumulation of free sugars and

564

starch, with a substantially greater reduction in the enhanced mutant NILs (Figure 7; Tables 1 and

565

S11).

566

The allelic interactions of Oy1-N1989 and wild-type oy1 alleles are consistent with the

567

inductive role of carbohydrate status on floral transition (Ohto et al. 2001; Seo et al. 2011; Wahl

568

et al. 2013; Minow et al. 2018). Additional work exploring proposed carbohydrate signaling

569

metabolites, such as T6P and organic acids, and analyses of the downstream floral integrators such

570

as the FT orthologs of maize are still needed to link our results to the existing models of floral

571

transition regulation in maize (Minow et al. 2018).

572

One complexity that we observed in our data is that defoliation did not separate

573

photosynthate levels from changes in chlorophyll (Figure 8). The mechanical removal of leaves

574

resulted in changes to CCM in the newly emerging leaves of defoliated plants. As a result, a

575

mechanical treatment served to highlight the interconnected nature of plant metabolism: large

576

changes to any feature of central metabolism or plant physiology results in large changes to all of

577

central metabolism and plant physiology. In an effort to separate photosynthate and chlorophyll

578

accummulation, one can conceive of alternate experiments such as measuring the time to maturity

579

in different light intensities achieved using neutral shade cloth to produce a gradient of

580

photosynthetically active radiation and sugar accumulation. Similarly, plants could be sprayed

581

with low doses of chemicals such as 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) that

582

disrupt electron transfer during the light reactions to reduce photosynthetic output of plants without

583

altering light fluence experienced by other photoreceptors. However, all these experiments may

584

suffer from the same confounding of NSC and chlorophyll as the defoliation experiment. As a

585

result, researchers should quantify chlorophyll after these treatments as any change in chlorophyll

586

complicate our ability to uncouple chlorophyll metabolism and sugar accumulation as

587

demonstrated by our defoliation experiment and all the carbohydrate partitioning mutants of maize

588

studied to date.

589

Two other subunits of magnesium chelatase are encoded by genes that were identified in

590

Arabidopsis as genomes uncoupled mutants, gun4 and gun5, with altered retrograde, plastid-to-

591

nuclear, signaling with defects in chlorophyll metabolism (Susek et al. 1993; Mochizuki et al.

592

2001; Larkin et al. 2003). Multiple studies have demonstrated retrograde signaling mutants with

593

defects in chlorophyll metabolism (Hernández-Verdeja and Strand 2018) and circadian rhythm

594

(Jones 2019). Retrograde signaling events are also associated with cell death, chloroplast

595

development, and etiolation but it acts via a number of modifiers of flowering, including

596

phytochromes, phytochrome signaling components, blue light perception via crytochrome1, and

597

circadian rhythmicity of key genes that affect flowering time. While retrograde signaling is an

598

attractive alternative model to sugar signaling for the phenomena reported here, mutants in

599

orthologs of oy1 in both monocots and dicots (Mochizuki et al. 2001; Gadjieva et al. 2005) have

600

been tested for a genomes uncoupled phenotype and they did not perturb retrograde signaling. This

601

makes it unlikely that Oy1-N1989 and vey1 are altering flowering time via aberrant retrograde

602

signals. Additional experiments are necessary to clearly separate the effects of chlorophyll

603

metabolite levels from photosynthate levels to independently test their effects on flowering time

604

in maize.

605

We have known that defoliation is practiced in some maize nurseries to stagger flowering

606

time and permit intercrossing of lines with divergent reproductive maturities. We had presumed

607

that this was based on published research. Remarkably, we were not able to find a reference for

608

this practice. Previous work on defoliation in maize has looked at the effect of early and late season

609

defoliation on growth, and yield components but did not report flowering times (Crookston and

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/706846; this version posted October 17, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

610

Hicks 1988; Pearson and Fletcher 2009). As a result, Figure 8 provides information that was

611

informally shared within the maize genetics research community but not described formally. In

612

addition, we extended this observation from maize to both sorghum and green foxtail, indicating

613

that defoliation can achieve staggered flowering times in these species as well. This may be a

614

general feature of grasses, but appears to not be universal in angiosperms as early-season

615

defoliation of photoperiod-sensitive strawberries did not affect flowering time (Guttridge 1959).

616

Sugar export and phloem loading mutants in maize that carry lesions in tie-dyed1, tie-dyed2,

617

sucrose export defective1, psychedelic, and sucrose trasporter1 have all been shown to delay

618

flowering time (Braun et al. 2006; Baker and Braun 2008; Ma et al. 2008; Slewinski et al. 2009;

619

Slewinski and Braun 2010). We also observed declines in sugar levels in Oy1-N1989 mutants

620

(Figure 7 and Table S11) and a delay in flowering time (Figure 1). It is tempting to consider these

621

mutants as a demonstration that sugar signaling can work independent of chlorophyll, but these

622

mutants also display low chlorophyll contents (Braun et al. 2006; Baker and Braun 2008; Ma et

623

al. 2008; Slewinski et al. 2009; Slewinski and Braun 2010). Curiously, sucrose export defective1

624

encodes tocopherol cyclase (Porfirova et al. 2002; Sattler et al. 2003). Tocopherol and chlorophyll

625

share the phytol side chain, and the salvage pathway for phytol side chains from chlorophyll can

626

contribute to tocopherol accumulation in both maize and Arabidopsis (Ischebeck et al. 2006;

627

Schelbert et al. 2009; Diepenbrock et al. 2017). While it is attractive to try and unify these findings,

628

chlorophyll breakdown products were only rate limiting for tocopherol synthesis in senescent

629

tissues of Arabidopsis (Zhang et al. 2014). Furthermore, in Oy1-N1989 mutants the phytol

630

precursors should be abundant as this pool is not being consumed by chlorophyll biosynthesis.

631

Future experiments that more carefully explore these metabolites, for instance, via other mutants

29
632

that do not simultaneously affect multiple pathways, especially chlorophyll metabolism, are

633

required.

634

Accumulation of sugars in the leaves due to sink disruption has been proposed to induce leaf

635

senescence in a variety of angiosperms, including maize and Arabidopsis (Allison and Weinmann

636

1970; Ceppi et al. 1987; Pourtau et al. 2006; Sekhon et al. 2012, 2019). In maize, leaf senescence

637

is triggered when pollination is prevented and sucrose accumulates in leaves due to the lack of the

638

sink activity of a pollinated ear (Allison and Weinmann 1970; Ceppi et al. 1987). This sucrose-

639

dependent leaf senescence is genotype-dependent, and B73 is particularly susceptible to this

640

phenomenon. Genetic inheritance of the induced senescence phenomenon in maize inbred line

641

B73 was proposed to be under the control of a single dominant locus (Ceppi et al. 1987). The leaf

642

senescent phenotypes of the sucrose export mutants demonstrate that excessive photosynthate

643

accumulation can cause tissue to senesce regardless of ear presence (Braun et al. 2006; Baker and

644

Braun 2008; Ma et al. 2008; Slewinski et al. 2009). Induced leaf senescence by sink removal or

645

sugar application shows some overlap of biochemical and molecular mechanisms with natural

646

senescence in plants (summarized in Sekhon et al. 2012). A study of gene expression in the B73

647

inbred of maize identified senescence associated genes that exhibit gene expression changes during

648

pollination-prevented leaf senescence (Sekhon et al. 2012). We found that leaf senescence could

649

be prevented or delayed by the suppression of photosynthesis in the Oy1-N1989 mutant and further

650

modulated by vey1 variants (Figure 9 and Table S12). We expect that future gene expression

651

studies in Oy1-N1989 mutant and sugar export mutants will identify genes consistently impacted

652

by lower and higher chlorophyll levels, presumably including senescence associated genes and

653

genes regulating carbohydrate metabolism.

The data are provided as mean ± standard deviations of three experimental replications. Each replication
consisted of three independent plants measurements for mutants and two for wild-type siblings. The
superscript connecting letter report between each genotype group (mutant or wild-type) indicates statistical
significance determined using ANOVA with post-hoc analysis using Tukey’s HSD at p<0.01. No statistically
significant difference was found between the wild-type siblings.

Figure 6. Effect of vey1 locus from B73 and Mo17 on flowering time in reciprocal isogenic backgrounds.
Representative plants showing
(A) Delayed maturity of the heterozygous mutants in isogenic Mo17 (BC7 generation) inbred background, compared
to the wild-type siblings. Mutant and wild-type siblings in b030 (B73-like NIL with vey1B73) shows early flowering
while the isogenic B73 introgression of the vey1Mo17 allele in b094 NIL exhibits delayed flowering.
(B) Early maturity in the heterozygous mutant in m097 (Mo17-like NIL with vey1B73) compared to the mutant in
B73 x Mo17 F1 hybrid background. Measuring stick on the left in both panels is 243 cm.
