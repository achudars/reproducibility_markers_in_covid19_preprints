ABSTRACT

17

The circadian system is phylogenetically conserved across a wide range of taxa. It

18

orchestrates organismal biological processes and is linked to life history and risk-taking

19

behavior. Fisheries-induced evolution affects life history and may also alter behavioral

20

traits in exploited populations. Thus, intensive and selective harvesting may lead to the

21

evolution of the circadian system and thereby affect temporal organization of

22

physiological processes. We present experimental results based on zebrafish (Danio

23

rerio) selection lines exposed to either large or small size-selective mortality relative to

24

a control, simulating evolutionary responses to intensive fishing. We show that size-

25

selective harvest leads to evolution of life-history, risk-taking and shoaling behaviors,

26

and importantly, also shifts the molecular circadian clockwork. Evolutionary effects of

27

size-selective harvesting on risk-taking and shoaling were linked to daily activity

28

rhythms in the small, but not in the large, size-selective mortality scenario. Both small

29

and large size-selective mortality induced an evolutionary shift of the molecular

30

circadian clockwork in the same direction in the brain and liver. Interestingly, the shifts

31

in the molecular circadian clockwork disappeared in the clock output pathway,

32

resulting in similar transcription profile among size-selective scenarios. We reveal that

33

size-selective harvesting not only alters life-histories, but also leaves an evolutionary

34

legacy in the behavioral and physiological machinery of exploited fish populations.

35

These changes can affect catchability, yield, recovery and the way exploited fish

Significance statement:

42

Harvesting constitutes a strong driver of life history evolution in wild populations, but

43

there is limited knowledge whether harvesting also leads to adaptive changes in the

44

underlying physiology and behavior of exploited populations. We use a multi-

45

generation zebrafish (Danio rerio) harvesting experiment simulating two different

46

fisheries scenarios and we show that size-selective mortality affect the circadian

47

system and collective fish personality traits. Such adaptations were present eight

48

generations after size-selective harvesting was stopped, indicating induced evolution

49

of the circadian system and behavioural traits in response to size-selective harvesting.

INTRODUCTION

52

Harvesting drives the evolution of animal populations on contemporary time scales by

53

creating selection pressures that substantially depart from natural conditions (1-3).

54

Unselective, yet elevated harvesting-induced mortality alone triggers the evolution of

55

a fast life history characterized by elevated reproductive investment, reduced age and

56

size at maturation, reduced post maturation growth and longevity (4, 5). The evolution

57

of a fast life history is reinforced by harvesting mortality being size-selective (6). Life

58

history evolution can alter correlated traits, such as physiological and behavioral traits

59

(6-9). However, physiological and behavioral adaptations in response to harvesting are

60

much less understood compared to harvesting-induced changes to life-histories (2, 8).

61

Our study fills this gap using an experimental system simulating fisheries-induced

62

evolution in response to size-selective harvest.

63

Fisheries-induced evolution can affect physiological and behavioral traits

64

through at least two key mechanisms. The first relates to correlated selection

65

responses of adaptive changes in life-histories (10). For example, the pace-of-life

66

syndrome proposes that life-history traits, such as growth rate or maturation size, are

67

systematically and genetically related to behavioural and physiological traits (11).

68

Accordingly, life-history adaptations caused by fisheries can also be expected to

69

indirectly affect the physiology and behavior of exploited fishes (5, 6, 9). Secondly,

70

fisheries can also directly select on physiological and behavioural traits, e.g., because

71

bold, aggressive, social or stress-resilient fishes are preferentially harvested with

72

certain gears (12-16). Theory (6, 9) and experimental harvesting with model fish

73

species (17-19) have indeed shown that both elevated and size-selective harvesting

74

typical of most real fisheries foster evolutionary adaptation of behavioral traits. What

75

is largely unknown is the underpinning mechanisms linking life history, physiology and

76

behavior in response to harvesting (8, 20) and how such mechanisms contribute to

77

shape the evolutionary trajectories in a multivariate selection environment (21).

78

One candidate pathway linking life-history, behavior and physiology is the

79

circadian system. The circadian system is widely conserved phylogenetically (22) and

80

controls daily rhythms of physiology and behavior (23). Thereby, the circadian clock

81

fulfills an adaptive function helping the organism to anticipate and maintain

82

synchronization to external 24-h environmental cycles (23-26). Functional circadian

83

clocks are essential for precise timing of activity, thereby helping the organism to avoid

84

or minimize risk of predation while maximizing foraging (27). Recent studies reported

85

an insofar unknown relationship of animal personality, particularly an animal’s

86

tendency to take risks, and the circadian system (28, 29) suggesting genetic

87

correlations among traits. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) of different coping styles, commonly

88

referred to as proactive/reactive behavioural phenotypes (30), were found to be

89

systematically linked to different properties of circadian rhythms (29). Moreover, life

90

history changes correlate with the circadian clock (e.g., 31, 32). Accordingly,

91

evolutionary adaptations of the circadian system in exploited populations may occur in

92

response to both behavioral or life history adaptations. Here, we report a study

93

documenting evidence for evolutionary shifts in the circadian system in response to

94

intensive size-selective harvesting using a model system based on zebrafish size-

95

selected lines.

96

The proximate mechanisms governing fisheries-induced evolution are difficult

97

to disentangle in the wild because phenotypic changes are also affected by plasticity

98

(2). A powerful means to single out the cause-and-effect of selective harvesting is

99

conducting selection experiments with model fish species in the laboratory (33). We

100

use a long-term harvesting experimental system based on zebrafish selection lines

101

exposed to strong directional harvest selection (a 75% per-generation harvest rate)

102

acting on either large or small fish, relative to a control line harvested randomly with

103

respect to body size (17). Zebrafish were selected in a social environment over five

104

generations. Afterwards, selection was halted for eight further generations to remove

105

all “maternal” effects (i.e. a summary term for all non-genetic ecological effects on the

106

phenotype of the offspring), allowing clean comparisons among the lines at F 13 in

107

terms of long-term outcomes of harvesting-induced evolution on behavioural traits

108

and the circadian system. The experimental zebrafish lines that we used in the present

109

study maintained key life-history adaptations until F 13 that were already induced at F 9

110

(17; see also Fig. S1), indicating that harvesting-induced evolution of life-history did not

111

recover to pre-harvesting levels.

112

Previous results using the zebrafish model system have shown that the

113

selection lines differ evolutionarily in reproductive allocation, adult body size, risk-

114

taking behavior, trait variability, allele composition and transcriptomic profiles (17, 19,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/622043; this version posted May 2, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

115

34, 35). Moreover, size-selection affected single nucleotide polymorphisms occurring

116

within regulatory areas of genes related to the circadian system (17), in particular

117

guca1c that is involved in the light reception cascade in the retina and pineal gland (36)

118

and tph2 that is involved in serotonin synthesis (37). These data collectively provided

119

strong evidence that size-selection over just five generations affected both genes and

120

phenotypes, suggesting that size-selection could also have left a molecular legacy in

121

the circadian system. In the present work, we test the hypothesis that risk taking

122

behavior and the circadian system share common pathways (29) and we predicted that

123

harvesting-induced evolution of risk-taking behavior has altered the circadian system

124

in the zebrafish selection lines. We also expected that possible changes in shoaling

125

behavior (i.e., sociability; 19) would affect the social synchronization of individual

126

circadian clocks (Bloch et al., 2013), with consequent changes in the collective

127

circadian output at the group level. Finally, we expected that changes of daily

128

behavioral rhythms would be mirrored by the underlying circadian molecular

129

clockwork in the central (i.e., brain; possibly associated with the control of swimming

130

activity) and peripheral (i.e., liver; possibly associated with the control of feeding

131

activity) oscillators, and by neuroendocrinological molecular markers related to energy

132

balance, appetite and growth.

133
134

RESULTS

135

Shoaling and risk-taking behavior

136

We first studied zebrafish shoaling behavior in a round experimental arena (see

137

Methods for details). We found significant (p < 0.001) repeatability of inter-individual

138

distance among shoal members (R = 0.70 [confidence interval: 0.49 – 0.85]) over time

139

(i.e., 150 and 190 days post fertilization, dpf; Fig. 1A). Moreover, we found that the

140

small-harvested line formed significantly (t 71 = - 3.52; p < 0.001) more cohesive (i.e.,

141

smaller inter-individual distance) shoals than controls, yet no significant (t 71 = 0.90; p =

142

0.373) differences existed among the large-harvested line and the controls (Fig. 1B).

143

Next, we studied zebrafish risk-taking behavior using a diving test in groups (see

144

Methods for details). We found significant (p < 0.001) repeatability for the time spent

145

by the shoals feeding at the surface (R = 0.62 [confidence interval: 0.39 – 0.79]) over

146

time (i.e., 230 and 240 dpf; Fig. 1C). The small-harvested line spent significantly (p <

147

0.01) more time feeding at the surface (i.e., a risky environment) than the control,

148

while the large-harvested line spent significantly (p < 0.05) less time than the control at

149

the risky surface (Fig. 1D). Hence, the large-harvested line was found to be significantly

150

shyer, while the small-harvested line was bolder than the control.

151
152

Daily and circadian activity rhythms

153

We recorded robust daily activity rhythms of swimming (Fig. 2A, B) and self-feeding

154

(Fig. 2C, D) behaviour in a separate group of zebrafish between 170 and 190 dpf (see

155

Methods for details; Fig. S2, S3). In all selection lines, the behavioral rhythms revealed

156

significant 24-hour periodicities during both light-dark (LD) trials (first LD trial, days 1-

157

15; second LD trial, days 22-36) and significant free-running rhythmicity under

158

constant dim light conditions, with periods close to 24-h (Fig. S3, Table 1, see

159

Supplement for details).

160

All the three zebrafish lines displayed the typical diurnal swimming activity

161

rhythms (Fig. 2A, B). The total swimming activity during the photophase was

162

significantly (p < 0.001) repeatable over the two LD trials (R = 0.78 [confidence interval:

163

0.53 – 0.92]; Fig. 3A), with the small-harvested line being significantly (t 30 = 3.52; p <

164

0.01) more active than controls (Fig. 3A). The selection lines were also significantly (p <

165

0.05) repeatable in their early peaks of swimming activity (R = 0.58 [confidence

166

interval: 0.19 – 0.84]). In particular, the small-harvested line concentrated significantly

167

(t 30 = 2.96; p < 0.01) more of their daily activity during the first four hours of the

168

photophase relative to controls (Fig. 3B). By contrast, the late peaks of swimming

169

activity were not significantly (p = 0.123) repeatable traits (Fig. 3C), therefore this

170

behaviour was not considered as a stable behavioral trait and was thus not compared

171

statistically among the selection lines.

172

All lines displayed self-feeding activity rhythms during the last hours of the

173

scotophase, immediately prior light-on (Fig. 2C, D). The self-feeding activity was

174

significantly (p < 0.05) repeatable (R ranged from 0.45 to 0.52) over the two LD trials in

175

all the four consecutive hourly sections that were analyzed (from three hours before to

176

one hour after light on, Fig. 4). At the onset of the self-feeding events (06:00 - 08:00 h;

177

darkness) both size-selected lines were significantly (p < 0.01) more active than

178

controls (Fig. 4A, B). Subsequently, during the hour before light-on (08:00 - 09:00 h),

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/622043; this version posted May 2, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

179

and the first hour after light-on (09:00 - 10:00 h), the small-harvested line, but not the

180

large-harvested line, was more active in demanding food than controls (Fig. 4C, D). To

181

obtain a more quantitative measure of feeding behavior, we measured the amount of

182

food demanded every two days normalized by the biomass of each fish group during

183

the first days of the first LD trial. Significant (F 2,33 = 5.161, p < 0.05) differences among

184

lines during the first two days were found. Specifically, the large-harvested fish

185

demanded more food per fish mass (0.80 ± 0.58 g/g) than controls (0.18 ± 0.36 g/g),

186

but these differences disappeared over time (Fig. S4).

187
188

Core clock genes

189

At the end of the behavioral activity trials we sacrificed the fish, under constant-

190

lighting conditions, to measure circadian transcript abundance with RT-qPCR (see

191

Methods for details). Core clock genes expression revealed significant differences in

192

their circadian oscillations among the zebrafish lines (Table 2). In the brain, the control

193

line showed a strong trend (p = 0.052) in the circadian rhythmicity of arntl1a and a

194

clear circadian oscillation of clock1a with a peak at the same Circadian Time (CT) of

195

arntl1a (CT0 for both genes; Table 2). By contrast, the small-harvested line lost

196

circadian rhythmicity of arntl1a and clock1a with respect to the control, while the

197

large-harvested line shifted its peaks of circadian expression for both genes (CT16

198

instead of CT0, Table 2 and Fig. 5). Results of per1b indicated significant circadian

199

patterns in all lines with main differences in peaks in both size-selected lines that

200

shifted from CT8 to CT12 relative to the control (Fig. 5, Table 2). In the liver, the small-

201

harvested fish showed similar circadian rhythmicity to control fish in terms of arntl1a,

202

while the large-harvested line revealed only a trend (p = 0.086) in the circadian

203

oscillation (Table 2). The control line did not show any circadian rhythmicity in terms of

204

clock1a and per1b, however, the size-selected lines revealed clear circadian

205

rhythmicity for these two genes with slightly different peaks (Table 2 and Fig. 5).

206
207

Light-inducible genes

208

In the brain, the control line showed no significant rhythmicity of per2, while the size-

209

selected lines oscillated with peaks at different circadian times (CT12 and CT8 for large-

210

and small-harvested lines, respectively; Table 2, Fig. 5). Results of cry1a indicated

211

significant circadian rhythmicity with different peaks in the size-selected lines relative

212

to the control: the large-harvested line shifted the peak from CT8 to CT12, while the

213

small-harvested line shifted from CT8 to CT16 (Table 2 and Fig. 5). In the liver, both

214

size-selected lines lost circadian rhythmicity of per2 with respect to the control. The

215

small-harvested line lost rhythmicity for cry1a, while the large-harvested line showed

216

the same peak compared to the control (Table 2 and Fig. 5).

217
218

Clock output genes

219

The circadian expression of clock output genes showed less peak shifts compared to

220

the other two groups of genes that we investigated (Table 2). In the brain, all lines had

221

a circadian rhythmicity of tef1 and dbpa with peaks at the same circadian time.

222

However, the large-harvested line showed a trend (p = 0.078) in the circadian

223

rhythmicity of dbpa (Table 2 and Fig. 5). In the liver, both size-selected lines shifted the

224

peak of the circadian oscillation of tef1 from CT12 to CT8 compared to the control

225

(Table 2 and Fig. 5). By contrast, dbpa did not show differences among the lines. The

226

control line only showed a trend (p = 0.095) for the circadian rhythmicity of dbpa

227

(Table 2 and Fig. 5).

228
229

Clock controlled genes related to growth and energy balance

230

The circadian expression of genes related to physiological processes, such as energy

231

balance (lepa) and growth (igf1), also revealed significant differences between the

232

size-selected lines and controls. The circadian oscillation of lepa expression in the brain

233

was only significant in the size-selected lines, but not in the control, with peaks at the

234

same circadian time (CT8). By contrast, we did not find significant circadian oscillation

235

of lepa in the liver (Table 3, Fig. 6). Finally, the igf1 circadian oscillation in the liver was

236

significant only in the control line (Table 3, Fig. 6).

237
238

DISCUSSION

239

Using an experimental system simulating fisheries-induced evolution following size-

240

selection, we reveal the evolutionary legacy left by five generations of size-selective

241

harvesting on shoaling and risk-taking behaviors as well as on the circadian molecular

242

and behavioral outputs. In particular, we demonstrate that individuals of the small-

243

harvested line (which is conceivable in recreational fisheries managed with a maximum

244

size limit or in commercial gears having an upper bounds on mesh sizes, e.g. gill nets)

245

took more risk during feeding at the surface, were more cohesive, were more active at

246

the beginning of the photophase and extended self-feeding activity during photophase

247

relative to the control. We also found the large-harvested line (which can be expected

248

in recreational fisheries managed with a minimum-length limit or in commercial

249

fisheries operating with a trawl) to be shyer and to initially demand more food per

250

biomass than controls, and there was also a trend for this line to be less cohesive than

251

control. The evolutionary effects of size-selective harvesting on risk taking, shoaling

252

and foraging seem to be linked to daily activity rhythms, particularly in the small-

253

harvested line. From a molecular perspective, we also found shifts of the clock genes

254

circadian expression in the brain and liver in the same direction for both size-selected

255

lines. Importantly, the molecular shifts of the clock genes disappeared in the clock

256

output pathway, suggesting the occurrence of a switch leading to overall similar daily

257

rhythms at the behavioral level in all three selection lines. This suggests that being

258

overall active during the day and look for food around sunrise has strong fitness value

259

for zebrafish, no matter what the molecular clock is signaling.

260
261

Collective personality traits and daily activity rhythms

262

The behavioural traits we studied represented stable and repeatable traits and thus

263

were indicative of zebrafish collective personality traits (38, 39). Importantly, we

264

demonstrated that shoaling and risk-taking behaviors were repeatable behavioral

265

traits over ontogenetic time. We also revealed daily swimming and self-feeding activity

266

rhythms (except for late peaks of swimming activity) to be repeatable across

267

experimental stages.

268

We documented behavioral adaptations in all the studied collective personality

269

traits, indicating that the evolutionary response to the disruptive size-selective

270

harvesting treatments allowed the small-harvested fish to elevate boldness to increase

271

their foraging efficiency, while the opposite was found in the large-harvested

272

treatment which showed increased shyness. These results agreed with predictions

273

from theory (6, 12). Feeding during the selection experiment occurred with clumped

274

food at the surface of the water during daylight (17), which can be considered a risky

275

environment for zebrafish (i.e. avian predation; 40). Therefore, bold individuals

276

spending more time at the surface, as the small-harvested line, were likely more

277

efficient at foraging. Our interpretation is additionally supported by the fact that the

278

small-harvested line formed more cohesive shoals relative to controls. Social fish

279

species, such as zebrafish, can forage more effectively in groups than solitary

280

individuals (e.g., 41). Therefore, being more cohesive could provide additional foraging

281

advantages in the small-, but not in the large-harvested line. By contrast, the large-

282

harvested line evolved increased shyness, most likely a response to the evolution of a

283

fast life-history (6). Thus, our findings are fully consistent with the idea that elevated

284

and positively size-selective harvesting selected for increased timidity/shyness (6, 12).

285

As regarding daily activity rhythms, the small-harvested line was found to be

286

more active during the photophase and concentrated swimming activity at the

287

beginning of the photophase. These findings again suggested the evolution of a

288

foraging-optimizing timing of activity, likely linked to boldness. Our finding are

289

supported by a recent study demonstrating that proactive zebrafish (i.e., risk-taking

290

individuals) are more active in the first hours of photophase compared to reactive ones

291

(29). Relatedly, the self-feeding activity events of the small-harvested line extended to

292

the hours before and after light-on. The timing of feeding is a key aspect for survival

293

and is traded-off against predation risk and food availability (24). The ecological

294

significance of zebrafish feeding during the last hours of darkness may be related to

295

avoidance of visual predators (e.g. birds; 40) and/or to storing energy to be prepared

296

for spawning that occurs at the beginning of photophase (42). However, the food

297

demand sensor was located close to the water surface (42; see also Fig. S2) and an

298

increase of self-feeding events towards light-on by the small-harvested line could

299

indicate an additional increase of foraging efficiency and safeguarding energy intake in

300

risky contexts. A further support for a link between boldness and daily activity rhythms

301

has been reported in a recent study that revealed artificial light at night affects risk-

302

taking behavior in the Trinidad guppy, Poecilia reticulata (43).

303

Overall, our results indicated an asymmetrical adaptation among behavior and

304

daily activity rhythms in the size-selective treatments as previously reported for life

305

history traits in other selection experiments (20, 21, 44). In fact, we demonstrated an

306

adaptive behavioral link between boldness and daily activity rhythms in the small-, but

307

not in the large-, harvested line. Fisheries-induced evolution of behavior likely has a

308

complex and multivariate nature (9, 21), thereby complicating generalizations related

309

to evolutionary correlations among traits (45-47). The somewhat asymmetrical

310

adaptation of behavior in the two size-selection lines did not extend to all traits that

311

we measured, which could be related to a functional limitation of the range of

312

evolution of our model species (21, 48).

313
314

Brain clock gene shift

315

Purely size-selective harvesting modified the circadian clock transcript oscillations in

316

the same direction in both size-selected lines relative to controls. This result was a

317

surprise. In fact, despite the differences documented in the timing of daily swimming

318

and self-feeding activity rhythms among size-selection lines, we did not expect shifts in

319

the underlying molecular clockwork because all lines revealed an overall diurnal

320

swimming activity, while the self-feeding activity was mainly performed within a range

321

of 4-5 hours (Fig. 2). Conversely to expectations, we found that peaks of clock gene

322

expressions in the brain were shifted up to eight hours in both size-selection lines with

323

respect to controls. Yet, the peak of the oscillations of the clock output genes (tef1 and

324

dbpa) showed a strong consistency among the three lines. Both tef1 and dbpa belong

325

to a group of clock-controlled genes that feedback onto the core clock (49), and tef1 is

326

also involved in the molecular switching mechanism controlling for photoperiodic

327

responsiveness in mammals (50), suggesting that the shifts documented in the core

328

clock and light-inducible genes can be switched before the clock output pathway. The

329

occurrence of a switch in the circadian clock was also reinforced by the fact that the

330

size-selected lines at F 9 showed genetic changes in areas of genes associated with

331

serotonin synthesis (17). Serotonin is a key element in the synthesis of melatonin that

332

is rhythmically secreted by the pineal gland (51). Melatonin represents a major

333

rhythmic output of the fish circadian system controlling photoperiodic-dependent

334

functions and synchronization of biological processes (51, 52). Thus, the serotonergic

335

system could have played a role in the switch mechanism we document in response to

336

size-selective harvest (17).

337

Our results did not indicate a link between harvesting-induced evolution of risk-

338

taking or other behaviors and the circadian molecular machinery in the brain because

339

the size-selection lines should have shown opposing adaptations in the circadian

340

system mirroring the adaptations in collective personality traits. Instead, the circadian

341

molecular shifts were pointing into the same direction in the two size-selection lines

342

relative to controls. Recent studies on zebrafish demonstrated that proactive and

343

reactive phenotypes in zebrafish explain a large fraction of the variation of the brain

344

transcriptome including expression of genes related to the circadian system (28).

345

Moreover, proactive phenotypes were found to have more robust molecular (i.e., clock

346

genes daily expression), humoral (i.e., daily secretion of melatonin) and behavioral

347

(i.e., locomotor activity) oscillations of the circadian system (29). However, both of the

348

cited studies measured transcripts abundance under LD conditions; therefore the truly

349

endogenous nature of the circadian molecular clockwork could have been masked by

350

the LD cycle. In our study, we measured transcript oscillations under constant

351

conditions, thereby providing a truly endogenous effect of size-selective harvesting on

352

the molecular circadian clockwork, and in our work both size-selection lines that

353

differed strongly in boldness responded similarly in the underlying molecular circadian

354

clockwork.

355

A possible explanation for our results could be related to a link between

356

harvesting induced evolution of life-history and the circadian system. In particular,

357

both size selected lines were previously reported to show evolution of a reduced age

358

and size at maturation compared to controls (17). Indeed, clock genes associate with

359

quantitative trait loci related to life history traits in fish, such as growth rate and length

360

in Oncorhynchus kisutch (53) and developmental rate and spawning time in

361

Oncorhynchus mykiss (32, 54). In particular, the core clock gene clock (i.e., clock1a, one

362

of the genes used here to characterize the core clock molecular machinery) is mainly

363

mapped in regions related to life history traits in salmonid fishes (32, 55). Therefore,

364

the possibility of a common molecular pathway or a pleiotropic effect of the brain core

365

clock machinery exist that is associated with the maturation schedule that evolved in

366

parallel directions in both size-selection lines according to previous studies (17).

367
368

Liver clock gene shift

369

The size-selected lines showed a shift in the peak of oscillations of some clock genes in

370

the liver, following a similar pattern to that observed in the brain. Moreover, the size-

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/622043; this version posted May 2, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

371

selected lines did not reveal circadian rhythmicity of the light-inducible genes. Only the

372

large-harvested line indicated a circadian oscillation of cry1a. However, the clock

373

output genes had consistent peaks of circadian oscillations. The mechanisms governing

374

the synchronization of the liver’s peripheral oscillator in fishes are not fully

375

understood, both LD and feeding play an important role in maintaining fitness (26, 56).

376

This could be the reason why we were not able to detect a clear effect of size-selective

377

harvesting in the liver circadian system as sampling was performed under constant dim

378

light to avoid a masking effect of the light-darkness cycle (57). The serotonergic system

379

also plays an important role in feeding processes and other behaviors in fish (57-59),

380

reinforcing the idea proposed above of its role as a mediator in the molecular switch of

381

the circadian clockwork.

382

We observed differences in the genes related to growth and energy balance

383

among the size-selection lines. The lepa expression in the brain displayed significant

384

circadian variations in both size-selected lines compared with the absence of

385

rhythmicity in the control group. Moreover, both size-selected lines showed a

386

disruption of the igf1 circadian rhythm in the liver. Results on both genes indicated a

387

modification of growth and reproductive allocation processes, lipid and protein

388

metabolism and energy balance (59), as previously reported for both size selected lines

389

at the phenotypical level at F 9 (17). Modifications of the insulin growth factors

390

pathways in the zebrafish’s skeleton muscle have also been documented in previous

391

size-selection experiments with zebrafish in other labs (20), supporting the idea that

392

this pathway could have a major role in mediating growth processes in response to

393

size-selection. Phenotypically, the large-harvested line also demanded more food

394

compared to the control at the beginning of the experimental phase, and earlier work

395

has revealed changes in genes related to growth-related processes and energy release

396

in the liver at F 11 (35). Therefore, it is plausible that size-selective harvest has

397

evolutionarily altered the allocation of energy as well as the behavioral mechanisms of

398

energy acquisition.

399

Our interpretation of altered energy allocation caused by harvesting is also

400

supported by the results of the Lester biphasic growth model (60) that describes life-

401

time growth patterns and energy allocation to soma vs. reproduction in the zebrafish

402

selection lines (Fig. S1). The growth trajectories indicate harvest-induced changes in

403

energy allocation patterns at F 9 and F 13 (Fig. S1), with the large-harvested line

404

investing early and intensively into reproduction, and the small-harvested one

405

investing early but at low intensity into gonad production and more intensively in

406

somatic growth (17). Note the terminal size attained by the large-harvested line was

407

previously found to be smaller than the other two lines (17; see also Fig. S1), while the

408

terminal size of the small-harvested and control lines was found to be similar. The

409

same pattern was revealed at F 13 , suggesting evolutionary fixation and lack of

410

phenotypic rebound eight generations after selection was halted. The phenotypic data

411

suggests the evolution of a mechanism unrelated to energy allocation through which

412

the small-harvested line is able to attain similar terminal size to the control fish. This

413

mechanism, as elaborated above, could be mediated by a correlated response of

414

foraging efficiency in risky contexts.

415

Collectively, our results indicate the occurrence of a switch downstream the

416

circadian clock both in central (brain) and peripheral (liver) oscillators, in response to

417

five generations of size-selection in zebrafish. This is the first documented evidence

418

that classical harvesting patterns of fisheries can leave a legacy in the molecular

419

circadian system of evolving fish populations. There are three mechanisms used to

420

explain circadian system switches (61): i) altered properties of the circadian clock

421

leading to different activity patterns; ii) identical properties of the circadian clock

422

switching in the output pathway, leading to different activity patterns; and iii) identical

423

properties of the circadian clock subjected to masking that ultimately determine the

424

activity patterns. Our results suggest the presence of a further mechanism where

425

altered properties of the circadian clock are switched in the molecular output

426

pathway, leading to overall similar daily activity patterns. The role of the clock output

427

in determining diurnal and nocturnal phenotypes is also supported by a recent study

428

with the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (62), where ten generations of artificial

429

selection for diurnal and nocturnal phenotypes were sufficient to obtain highly

430

divergent strains where most differentially expressed genes were associated with the

431

clock output (62). The switching mechanism we describe here could be confounded by

432

the effect of size-selective harvesting on social interactions. In particular a possible

433

alteration of shoaling behavior could alter the social synchronization of circadian clocks

434

of the shoal members (63). Our results indicate that shoaling behavior (measured as

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/622043; this version posted May 2, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

435

inter-individual distance among shoal members) was significantly altered in the small-

436

harvested line and also showed a trend to be different, in a different direction, in the

437

large-harvested line, suggesting that a social-mediated mechanism is not likely the

438

cause of the switching described for both size-selected lines in the present study.

439
440

Conclusions

441

The main impacts of human activities on biological rhythms of wildlife are related to

442

diurnal disturbance as documented in an increase of nocturnality in mammalian

443

species in response to human presence (64). Another important human-induced

444

change of activity rhythms is represented by artificial light at night that has been

445

demonstrated to have a profound impact on circadian rhythms in a wide range of taxa

446

(65). Using a selection experiment simulating fisheries-induced evolution, our work

447

adds to this literature by showing that size-selective harvesting as is typical in many

448

fisheries or under specific harvest regulations can substantially shift the circadian

449

molecular clockwork, yet without strong changes in the daily behavioral activity

450

rhythms of our model species. Moreover, the changes of risk-taking and shoaling

451

behaviors provide empirical evidence for size-selection to leave a strong behavioural

452

legacy, supporting recent theory (6). Our work shows that the evolutionary impact of

453

fisheries far extends from life-history traits to behavioral traits and to the circadian

454

system, providing advancements in the understanding of the molecular architecture

455

controlling the evolutionary trajectories of populations exposed to a multivariate

456

anthropogenic selection. Evolutionary changes as the ones documented here can have

457

important consequences for organism performance, social groups, population

458

dynamics, recovery, and ultimately fisheries quality (12, 13, 66).

MATERIAL AND METHODS

461

Selection lines

462

Our study system consists of wild-collected zebrafish (Danio rerio) from West Bengal in

463

India (for more details see 67). The parental wild-collected population was

464

experimentally harvested by exposing them to strong directional selection (a 75% per-

465

generation harvest rate) for either large body size (large-harvested) or small body size

466

(small-harvested). A third line was harvested randomly with respect to size and used as

467

control (17). Each selection line was replicated twice for a total of six selection lines.

468

Size-selective harvesting treatments were applied during the first five generations (17)

469

and then harvesting halted for eight generations until F 13 . At F 9 , the large-harvested

470

line evolved a smaller adult length and weight and higher relative fecundity compared

471

to controls (17). By contrast, the small-harvested line showed reduced reproductive

472

investment and no change in adult length compared to the control line (17). Both size

473

selected line evolved different maturation schedules by maturing smaller and at

474

younger age than the control line (for more details see 17) and such differences are

475

still detected at F 13 (the generation used here) as indicated by results of a Lester

476

biphasic growth model and associated life-history traits (See Fig. S1). These changes

477

indicated a harvest-induced change in energy allocation patterns and no recovery to

478

pre-harvesting levels until F 13 , with the large-harvested line investing early and

479

intensively into reproduction, and the small-harvested line investing early but at low

480

intensity into gonad production and more intensively in somatic growth. Moreover,

481

small-harvested juveniles at F 10 were significantly more explorative and bolder than

482

controls, suggesting evolution of personality (17). In summary, the genetically diverged

483

selection lines differed significantly in their reproductive investment, adult body size,

484

juvenile behavior, trait variability, allele composition and gene expression (17, 34, 35).

485

Zebrafish selection lines for the present experiment where from F 13 . They were

486

reared in groups and under ad libitum feeding and maintained under the following

487

conditions: water temperature at 26 ± 0.5 °C; photoperiod at 12:12 h LD cycle (lights

488

on/off at 07:00 and 19:00, respectively); fed three times per day with dry food

489

(TetraMin, Tetra) mainly in the first part of the light hours (at 09:00; 11:00 and 13:00).

490

Fish were reared and manipulated following the guidelines of the European Union

491

(2010/63/EU) and the Spanish legislation (RD 1201/2005 and Law 32/2007). The

492

experimental protocols were approved by the Spanish National Committee and the

493

Committee of the University of Murcia on Ethics and Animal Welfare.

495

Shoaling and risk-taking behavior experiments

496

Zebrafish is a social species that forms shoals (40), and both risk-taking behavior and

497

circadian rhythms are sensitive to social modulation (68, 69). Therefore, we used

498

zebrafish shoals for testing our hypothesis because it is the appropiate reflection of the

499

phenotypes in the original environment that the selection experiment operated on.

500

Shoaling behavior was recorded two consecutive times when zebrafish were

501

150 and 190 dpf (at about the same age used for the circadian experiment, see below).

502

We randomly selected 6 groups of 8 fishes for each of the six selection line (12 groups

503

for each treatment: large-harvested, small-harvested and control line). The groups

504

were transferred to 3-L rearing boxes at 30 dpf and maintained under the conditions

505

explained above. The standard length of the experimental fish groups at 170 dpf was

506

within the following range: large-harvested (1.9 – 2.7 cm); control (2.1 – 2.8 cm); small-

507

harvested (2.1 – 2.7 cm). Shoals behavior was measured in a white round arena

508

(diameter of 60 cm) with 10 cm of water as reported in other studies that have tested

509

shoaling behavior in zebrafish (70). The arena was placed on a table behind a white

510

curtain to avoid any kind of disturbance to the fish during the experimental trials. On

511

top of the arena (at about 1 m) we placed a webcam (Logitech C920; resolution: 1920 x

512

1080 pixels; frame rate: 30 frames per second) that was connected to a computer

513

were video recordings were stored. Behavior was measured between 09:00 and 13:00

514

h. We started the experimental trials two hours after lights on to avoid measuring

515

behavior when mating usually occurs (first hours after lights on; see 40). The fish group

516

was introduced in the experimental arena by gently pouring them together with the

517

water from the rearing boxes and left undisturbed for 25 min. Then, inter-individual

518

distance was measured for five min as reported in other studies (70).

519

We used the same groups of zebrafish to perform an additionally behavioral

520

test on the time spent feeding at the surface of the water. We repeated trials two

521

times (i.e., at 230 and 240 dpf). The groups of eight zebrafish were moved from the 3-

522

liter rearing box in a new experimental tank (width x length x height = 10 x 30 x 25 cm)

523

with 22 cm of water. The experimental tank was placed on a table behind a white

524

curtain. On the side of the experimental tank (at about 50 cm) we placed a webcam (as

525

described above). Zebrafish were introduced in the experimental tank and left

526

undisturbed for 3 min before starting the experimental trial. That time was sufficient

527

to remove the diving response usually seen in these methodological approach (71).

528

Then, a small quantity of food was added at the surface and at the same time we

529

started video recording for 30 s (sufficient time for zebrafish to consume almost all the

530

food) to quantify the cumulative time each of the eight fish spent feeding at the

531

surface of the experimental tank (one third of the water column = at about 7 cm). All

532

video recordings were analyzed with automated behavioral tracking (EthoVision XT 9,

533

Noldus Information Technologies Inc.; www.noldus.com).

534
535

Circadian experimental set up and design

536

Activity rhythms were recorded in a parallel experiment with a new set of fish when

537

they were at about 170 dpf. We randomly selected 3 groups of 15 fishes for each of

538

the six selection line (6 groups and 90 fishes for each treatment: large-harvested,

539

small-harvested and control line). The mass of the experimental fish groups was within

540

the following range: large-harvested (3.6 – 5.7 g); control (3.3 – 6.5 g); small-harvested

541

(4.6 – 6.1 g). Each 15-fish group was then placed in a 8-L experimental aquarium

542

(30×13×23 cm; see Fig. S2) equipped with aeration and mechanical and biological

543

filters. Light was provided by white LEDs (LED Flex-strip 1043-W, Solbright, RAYTE,

544

Murcia, Spain), with a light intensity of 435 lux at the water surface. The photoperiod

545

was set at a 12:12 h LD cycle, and a heater (75 W Magictherm; Prodac, China) kept the

546

water temperature at 26 ± 0.5 °C. The lights were set to turn on and off at 09:00 h and

547

21:00 h, respectively.

548

The experimental set up we used was previously designed to record at the same

549

time swimming (as a proxy of locomotor activity) and self-feeding activity by a group of

550

zebrafish (Fig. S2; see also 42). An infrared photocell (E3S-AD62 Omron, Kyoto, Japan)

551

was installed in the middle of the longer side of each aquarium, 15 cm below the water

552

surface. The sensitivity of this photocell was adjusted to detect fish at any distance

553

from the sensor to cover the full length of the aquarium (30 cm) and measure the

554

swimming activity. The self-feeding system consisted of another photocell located in

555

the upper corner of the aquarium, 2.5 cm below the water surface and 1.5 cm from

556

the side. The sensitivity of the photocell was adjusted to detect fish approaching within

557

a range of 1 cm independently of the size range used in the experiment. The photocell

558

was connected to a commercial feeder (Eheim, Deizisau, Germany) and when zebrafish

559

interrupted the infrared light beam, the feeder turned on and at about 0.2% g

560

flakes/biomass dropped into the aquarium. The feeder was placed in the same area, 10

561

cm from the sensor (for more details see 42). Swimming and self-feeding activities

562

were recorded and stored in a computer every 10 min. Before starting experimental

563

trials, fishes were acclimated to laboratory conditions and to the use of the self-feeder

564

for 15 days.

565

After the above mentioned acclimation period we recorded the swimming and

566

self-feeding activity for 38 days (from at about 170 to 210 dpf). The experimental trial

567

was subdivided in four consecutive phases: (first LD trial: 15 days) 12:12 h LD cycle to

568

investigate daily swimming and self-feeding rhythms; (constant conditions: 7 days)

569

constant dim light (3.5 lux at the water surface) to investigate the endogenous free-

570

running rhythms of swimming and self-feeding activity; (second LD trial: 15 days) 12:12

571

h LD cycle to investigate their resynchronization; (final constant conditions) constant

572

dim light to ascertain the endogenous expression patterns of clock genes. Moreover,

573

during the first 6 days of the first LD trial we measured the daily amount of food

574

demanded normalized by the mass of the fish group to have more quantitative

575

information on the self-feeding behavior of the fishes.

576
577

Gene expression analysis

578

The first group of genes was composed by genes related to the core transcriptional-

579

translational feedback loop driving circadian oscillation in vertebrates (per1b, clock1a,

580

arntl1a). The second group involved light-inducible genes (per2, cry1a). The third

581

group were genes related to the circadian clock output (dbpa, tef1), and the fourth

582

group was composed of circadian clock controlled genes (lepa, and igf1) related to

583

growth and energy balance. lepa (lepa) was measured both in brain and liver and igf1

584

only in liver. The gene lepa acts as satiation signal in teleosts and has implications in

585

energy balance and glucose homeostasis, it is mainly secreted in the liver with a daily

586

rhythm of expression (57, 72). The gene lepa is also expressed in the teleost brain

587

where expression increases after a meal (73). The gene igf1 is involved in growth

588

processes and signals lipid metabolism and is secreted with a daily rhythm of

589

expression (57).

590

Gene expression was measured at the end of the activity rhythms experiment.

591

Samples were collected throughout a 24-hour cycle at six different time points

592

(circadian time, CT: 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20). Fish were exposed for 24 h to the second

593

constant dim light phase. We sampled a total of five fishes for each time point and

each treatment. Fishes were killed on ice and then the whole brain and liver were

595

dissected and put in RNAlater at -80°C. Total RNA was isolated using a trizol reagent

596

(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The amount,

597

quality and composition of isolated RNA were analyzed by Nanodrop ND-1000

598

(Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Wilmington, USA). DNase-treated RNA was used to

599

perform cDNA synthesis in a final volume of 20 μl using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit

600

(Biorad, USA). The reaction was performed at 46°C for 20 min, followed by a 1-min

601

inactivation step at 95°C.

602

cDNA was PCR-amplified with the StepOnePlus Real- Time PCR System (Applied

603

Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using SsoAdvanced™ Universal SYBR® Green

604

Supermix (Biorad, USA). The thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 30 s of

605

denaturation at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of a 15-s denaturation step at 95°C, and

606

then by an annealing-elongation step for 30 s at 60°C. After amplification, a melting

607

curve analysis was performed to confirm amplicon specificity. All the samples were run

608

in triplicate.

609

Gene-specific primers are indicated in Table S1. The relative expression levels of

610

each sample were calculated by the 2–ΔΔCT method (74), using geometric mean of three

611

housekeeping genes (βactin, GADPH and EF1α) in both tissues.

Statistical analysis

614

Inter-individual distance and time spent feeding at the surface of the water were

615

transformed by finding the exponent (lambda), which made the values of the response

616

variable as normally distributed as possible with a simple power transformation. Next,

617

we calculated the adjusted repeatability (selection lines as fixed effect; 75) across age

618

for inter-individual distance among group members (150 and 190 dpf) and for time

619

spent feeding at the surface (230 and 240 dpf). Finally, we modelled the behavioral

620

measures using linear mixed-effects models (76) with selection lines as fixed effect and

621

shoal nested within trials as random intercepts. Model fitting was assessed by checking

622

the plot of the residuals vs. the fitted values.

623

Time series of swimming and self-feeding activity were visually inspected by

624

plotting actograms and then using a Chi-square periodogram (77) to scan for the

625

presence of significant (p < 0.05) periodicity in the range 8-28 h and percentage of

626

variance (%V) explained by each period, reported as a measure of rhythms' robustness

627

(78). Waveform analysis (24-h based) was carried out in both LD trials, and raw time

628

series values (i.e. number of infrared light beam interruptions) were transformed in %

629

of maximum to standardize the data. The Midline Estimating Statistic Of Rhythm

630

(MESOR) was computed and represented as a horizontal threshold in waveform plots

631

(78).

632

As regarding swimming activity, we estimated total activity for each group by

633

calculating the area under the waveform curve during both LD trials (78). Next, early

634

and late peaks of activity were calculated as percentage of activity during the first

635

(early) and last (late) four hours of photophase. As regarding feeding activity, we

636

estimated feeding events for each group by calculating the area under the waveform

637

curve during four different hourly sections: i) from 06:00 to 07:00; ii) from 07:00 to

638

08:00; iii) from 08:00 to 09:00 (i.e., the hour before lights on); iv) from 09:00 to 10:00

639

(i.e., the hour after lights on). We calculated the adjusted repeatability (selection lines

640

as fixed effect) of these behavioral traits over the two LD trials as described above. We

641

lambda transformed them as above and modelled the data using a linear mixed-effects

642

models (76) with selection lines as fixed effect and shoals nested within LD trials as

643

random intercepts. Finally, we modelled the amount of food demanded by using a

644

linear model with selection lines and days of experiment (1-2, 3-4, 5-6) as fixed effects.

645

Model fitting was assessed by checking the plot of the residuals vs. the fitted values.

646

Periodicity in gene expression was checked using RAIN, a robust non-parametric

647

method for the detection of rhythms in biological data that can detect arbitrary

648

waveforms and has been widely applied in the measurement of circadian transcripts

649

abundance (79).

650

Periodogram and waveform analysis were performed using the software

651

Eltemps (www.el-temps.com). The rest of analyses were implemented using R 3.3.1

652

(https://www.R-project.org/) and the following additional packages: “rain” (79);

653

“rcompanion” (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rcompanion), “rptR” (80), and

654

“nlme” (81). In all cases, we used a 95% confidence interval.

Table 1 - The output of the periodogram analysis for swimming and self-feeding
activity rhythms during the three steps of the experiment (first light-darkness trial:
LD1; constant dim light: LL; and second light-darkness trial: LD2) according to the three
selection lines (large-harvested: LH, small-harvested: SH and control: RH). Periods (T)
or free running periods (tau) are averaged according to the number of groups (N; the
proportion indicates the number of groups with significant rhythms) and the
robustness of periodicities are expressed as percentage of variance explained (%V)
together with the midline estimating statistic of rhythm (MESOR). The standard errors
are reported between parentheses.

Swimming and feeding activity rhythms

1019

Visual inspection of actograms evidenced diurnal swimming activity (with some

1020

evident bimodal peaks at lights on/off) while feeding activity indicated a main peak in

1021

the last part of the darkness hours (Fig. S2).

1022

The Chi-square periodogram analysis identified a significant 24-hours

1023

periodicity in swimming activity during both light-dark (LD) trials. Interestingly during

1024

the first LD trial the robustness of rhythms of the control line is lower (29.74±10.38

1025

%V; Table 1) than the other two lines (large-harvested: 47.41±4.54 %V; small-

1026

harvested: 52.48±10.13 %V, Table 1) in fact the control line showed a higher swimming

1027

activity during darkness (Fig. 2). Such differences were no more evident during the

1028

second LD trial when all lines have similar robust rhythms (large-harvested: 52.45±8.54

1029

%V; control: 51.01±14.30 %V; small-harvested: 56.96±20.82 %V; Table 1) and the

1030

control line did not show higher swimming activity during darkness (Fig. 2). Finally

1031

swimming activity showed variable significant free running rhythmicity under constant

1032

dim light (Table 1). The Chi-square periodogram also detected bimodality (peaks of

1033

significant 12-hours periodicity) in swimming activity in both LD trials.

1034

Self-feeding activity rhythms had a significant 24-hours periodicity during both

1035

LD trials. Robustness was similar in all the lines during the first (large-harvested:

1036

46.44±7.45 %V; control: 38.89±18.18 %V; small-harvested: 43.21±6.35 %V, Table 1)

1037

and second (large-harvested: 46.07±11.67 %V; control: 32.29±7.92 %V; small-

1038

harvested: 37.87±10.17 %V) LD trial. Finally under constant dim light the self-feeding

1039

activity indicated variable free running rhythmicity (Table 1). The Chi-square

1040

periodogram did not detect bimodality in self-feeding activity rhythms.

1041

During the first LD trial bimodality was detected in 3 out of 6 groups in the

1042

large-harvested line (robustness: 25.17±12.20 %V), in three out of six groups in the

1043

control line (robustness: 8.50±1.73 %V) and in one out of five groups in small-

1044

harvested line (robustness: 23.18 %V). During the second LD trial bimodality was still

1045

present in two out of six groups in large-harvested line (robustness: 25.97±7.98 %V), in

Figure S2 – A schematic representation of the experimental aquarium used in this
study to measure swimming and self-feeding activity rhythms. Light illumination was
provided from above. An infrared sensor was placed in the central part of the
aquarium to measure swimming activity, while another infrared sensor was places to
one of the corners and connected to the nearby feeder (for more details see Del Pozo
et al., 2011).

Figure S3 - Six representative double plotted (time scale 48 h) actograms (one for each
selection line) representing locomotor and self-feeding activity over 38 days of
experiment (left: large-harvested line; middle: control line, right: small-harvested line).
Swimming and self-feeding activity of zebrafish are indicated by the height of black
areas that represent the number of infrared light beam interruptions/10 min.
Open/filled bars at top represent a 12-h light/12-h darkness photoperiod for the first
(LD1) and second (LD2) light-darkness trial, while during LL zebrafish shoals were
exposed to constant dim light.

Figure S4 – Boxplots of the amount of food demanded (g) normalized on the weight of
the fish group (g) during the first 6 days in the first light-darkness trial (LD1: days 1-6).
The different colors represent the selection lines: red for large-harvested (LH; N = 6)
grey for control (RH; N = 6) and blue for small-harvested (SH; N = 6). Boxplots
represent the median (bold centerline), the 25th (top of the box) and 75th percentile
(bottom of the box). Significant differences are indicated by black horizontal lines (*: p
value < 0.05).
