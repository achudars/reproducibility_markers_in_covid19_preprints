Abstract
Human brain development involves spatially and temporally heterogeneous changes,
detectable across a wide range of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures. Investigating
the interplay between multimodal MRI and polygenic scores (PGS) for personality traits
associated with mental disorders in youth may provide new knowledge about typical and
atypical neurodevelopment. We derived independent components across cortical thickness,
cortical surface area, and gray/white matter contrast (GWC) (n=2596, 3-23 years), and tested
for associations between these components and age, sex and-, in a subsample (n=878), PGS
for neuroticism. Age was negatively associated with a unimodal component reflecting higher
global GWC, and additionally with components capturing common variance between global
thickness and GWC, and several multimodal regional patterns. Sex differences were found for
components primarily capturing global and regional surface area (boys>girls), but also
regional cortical thickness. For PGS for neuroticism, we found weak and bidirectional
associations with a component reflecting right prefrontal surface area. These results indicate
that multimodal fusion is sensitive to age and sex differences in brain structure in youth, but
only weakly to polygenic load for neuroticism.

Introduction
The cerebral cortex and subjacent white matter undergo substantial modifications and
refinement during childhood and adolescence 1-3, paralleled by the qualitative and quantitative
evolution of cognitive abilities 4, 5. These developmental changes coincide with increasing risk
for mental disorders 6, 7. Mapping variation in brain development using magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) may therefore not only inform ontogenetic models of neurocognitive
development, but also delineate aberrant spatiotemporal patterns related to emerging
psychopathology.
Cortical development is multifaceted, with cortical volume and its subcomponents
thickness and surface area showing distinct developmental patterns 8-10, and genetic
underpinnings 11, 12. Less explored measures of signal intensity variation in the T1-weighted
image may reflect additional and partly distinct neurobiological properties 13-16. Specifically,
the contrast between cortical grey matter (GM) and closely subjacent white matter (WM)
intensities, the grey/white matter contrast (GWC), has been shown to be heritable 16, and
associated with development 14, aging 13, 17, and schizophrenia 18. Although the underlying
biology of GWC is complex and debated, the measure has been linked to differential
intracortical and WM myelination 13.
The onset of puberty, as well as the pubertal period, differs between adolescent boys
and girls 19, 20. There have also been reports of sex specific shifts in the onset of
developmental psychopathology, as well as variations in overall risk for mental disorders 7, 21.
Results concerning both the extent, and metric specificity of sex related neurodevelopmental
differences are however, inconclusive 8, 9, 22 and no studies have investigated sex related
developmental differences in GWC.
The relationships between distinct brain structural properties captured by different
MRI measures are poorly understood, but might be informed by methods such as linked

independent component analysis (LICA), which can parse the common and unique variance
across multiple modalities into separate components of shared variance 23. LICA studies have
reported unique structural patterns sensitive to lifespan development 24, 25, and
psychopathology 26, 27. Multimodal fusion, also including GWC, thus shows promise for
capturing both typical brain developmental patterns and patterns associated with susceptibility
for mental illness.
High levels of neuroticism is associated with several forms of psychopathology 28, 29,
including the overarching “p factor” from dimensional psychopathology models 30, 31, and
internalizing symptoms from core domain models 28, which captures vulnerability toward
mood and anxiety disorders 31, 32. Twin and family studies have shown that genetic differences
account for about 40% of the trait variance 33, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
have documented a highly polygenic signal 34, in line with most complex traits 35. Polygenic
scores (PGS) are defined as the weighted sum of an ensemble of trait-associated alleles 36, and
reflect the individual level of cumulative genetic signal across the genome. Only one prior
neuroimaging study has investigated the association between PGS for neuroticism and brain
structure, reporting negative associations with regional cortical surface area in two adult
samples 37. Studies in youth are lacking, but may provide insight into the brain structural
correlates of genetic dispositions for broad psychopathology-associated traits in a period of
life when many mental disorders typically emerge.
To this end, we combined cortical thickness, surface area, and GWC using FLICA
(FMRIB’s LICA) in 2596 youths (3-23 years), and tested for associations between the
resulting multimodal modes of variation and age, sex and-, in a subsample (n=878), PGS for
neuroticism and two of its subcomponents (depressed affect and worry). Based on an extant
literature on child and adolescent brain development 9, 14, 38, 39 we hypothesized that age would
be particularly associated with components dominated by GWC and thickness. Next, we

predicted associations between sex and modes of variation reflecting surface area 40, 41.
Finally, based on findings from a previous study 37 we hypothesized that the strongest
associations between PGS for neuroticism, depressed affect and worry, would be with modes
reflecting surface area.

Materials and Methods
Participants
We combined data from two large-scale publicly available US samples; the Pediatric Imaging,
Neurocognition, and Genetics (PING) study (http://ping.chd.ucsd.edu) and the Philadelphia
Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) (Permission No. 8642). PING is a multisite initiative,
consisting of typically developing youths aged 3-21 years with genotyping, standardized
behavioral measures, and multimodal imaging for a large subgroup (n = 1239) 4, 42, 43. PNC is
a population-based sample consisting of 8-23 year old youths with genetic, cognitive and
clinical data, as well as multimodal imaging for a large subgroup (n=1601) 44, 45. The cohorts,
including recruitment and exclusion criteria, are further described in Supplementary
Materials.
We first excluded PNC subjects with severe medical health conditions (n=70), before
combining all subjects with available imaging data from both samples (n=2727). After
stringent MRI quality control, 115 participants were excluded due to missing or poor quality
T1 data (see below), and 16 additional subjects were removed due to missing demographics or
scan site information. The final imaging sample thus consisted of 2596 subjects (1316 girls)
aged 3.0-23.2 years (mean=13.8, SD=4.6) (Figure 1). See Supplementary Table 1 for
demographics.

The included imaging data was acquired on 11 separate 3T whole-body scanners from Philips
Medical Systems (Achieva), GE medical systems (Signa HDx and Discovery MR750), and
Siemens (TrioTim), the latter including a single scanner on which the full PNC sample was
scanned. T1 voxel sizes ranged from approximately 0.9 to 1.2 mm. See Supplementary
Materials for detailed descriptions of acquisition parameters, and care and safety procedures
implemented for scanning children.
The T1-weighted datasets were processed using FreeSurfer (FS) 5.3
(http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu), which performs volumetric segmentations and cortical
surface reconstructions, including the “white”- (grey/white matter boundary), and “pial”(grey/ cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) boundary) surface 46, 47. Cortical thickness was computed as
the shortest vertex-wise distance between the white and pial surface, while cortical surface
area, based on the white surface, was computed by the amount of vertex-wise expansion and
contraction needed to fit a common template (fsaverage) 46, 47. As implemented previously 14,
18, 48

and fully described in Supplementary Materials, we extracted intra-subject signal

intensities from the non-uniform intensity normalized volume (nu.mgz). GWC was then
computed as: 100 x (white - gray)/[(white - gray)/2] 18, so that higher GWC reflects greater
GM/WM signal intensity difference. Thickness, area and GWC surface maps were registered
to fsaverage and smoothed using a Gaussian kernel of 15-, 10-, and 10-mm full width at half
maximum (FWHM), respectively, to obtain similar smoothness across modality surfaces 26.
See Supplementary Materials and previous descriptions 14, 49 for in detail accounts of
the stringent quality evaluation performed on the imaging data to confirm consistency across
sites and as in-scanner head motion is common in children.

Thickness, area, and GWC surface maps were decomposed into spatially independent modes
of variation using FLICA 23, 25 (http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FLICA). As imaging data
had been obtained from various scanners, and initial investigations showed large scanner
effects, we residualized all surface maps for effects of scanner before running FLICA. This
was done by use of generalized additive models, using the “gam” function in R
(https://www.r-project.org/), with 10 knots and age and sex as additional covariates. Age, sex
and model residuals were returned to surface maps. See Supplementary Figures 1-3 and
Supplementary Table 2 for comparisons of surface maps before and after scanner
residualization. FLICA was thereafter run with 3000 iterations, and a final model order of 60,
which was pragmatically chosen based on the highest cophenetic coefficient 50, as compared
with model orders of 40 and 80. See Supplementary Figure 4 for an ordered bar plot of the
explained variance of each component.

Polygenic scores
We calculated PGS in a subset of participants with white European ancestry (n= 878), using
the PRSice v1.25 software, based on an earlier GWAS on neuroticism 51. PGS p-thresholds
were calculated within the range of 0.001 and 0.5, using default settings, including removal of
the major histocompatibility complex (MHC; chromosome 6, 26-33Mb) and pruning of SNPs
based on linkage disequilibrium and p-values. We first chose a significance threshold of 0.05
based on the convention of several previous GWAS studies 34, and additionally, based on a
previous implementation 52, performed a principal component analysis (PCA) in R
(https://www.r-project.org/) on all p-thresholds. The first factor explained 88.1% of variance,
with the p-threshold 0.329 showing the highest contribution, and was extracted as a
complementary and considerably more liberal PGS p-threshold.

Based on results from the GWAS 51 reporting that neuroticism’s genetic signal partly
originated in two distinguishable sub-clusters termed “depressed affect” and “worry”, we
additionally calculated PGS for these using the same approach as described above. In addition
to the standard 0.05 threshold, the first PCA factor explained 93.4% of the variance for both,
with p-thresholds 0.257 and 0.253 showing the highest contribution for depressed affect and
worry, respectively.

Statistical analyses
We used linear models, to test for main effects of age, sex and PGS for neuroticism on all
FLICA components in R. First, for each of the 60 components we tested for linear effects of
age, with scanner as an additional co-variate. Then we tested for main effects of sex, covarying for scanner and age. Finally, we tested for main effects of the different polygenic
scores on the FLICA components. Effects were tested on each of the 60 components in
separate models, with scanner, age, sex, and the first 4 PCA derived genetic principal
components included in the model to account for population stratification. P-values from all
models within each test were adjusted for multiple comparisons by false discovery rate using
Hochberg’s procedure and a significance threshold of 0.05.
To visualize each model, we residualized covariates from component loadings by
linear regression, and plotted them using ggplot2 53 . See Supplementary Materials for
ANOVA analyses, performed to investigate possible effects of scanner.

Results
Multimodal components
Among the 60 independent components (ICs), IC1 explained 34.3% of the variance in the
included modalities across the 2596 subjects, and was dominated by global GWC (97%)

(Figure 2). The spatial pattern showed relatively lower weighting in insula, sensorimotor and
visual cortices and higher weighting within prefrontal cortices. IC2, which explained 14.8%
of variance, was dominated by global surface area (94%), with higher weighting within
prefrontal, occipital, and lateral temporal regions (Figure 3). IC3, explained 11.7% of
variance, and captured global cortical thickness (55%) and global negative GWC (45%). The
cortical thickness spatial pattern showed higher weighting in frontal regions, pre-and postcentral sulcus, and within certain parietal and occipital folds. The GWC pattern showed
higher negative weighting in insula, medial visual- and parietal regions (Figure 2).
IC4 explained 6.0% of the variance, while the remaining 56 components in sum
explained 33.2%. IC4-IC60 were uni- or multimodal, regionally specific, and often bilateral.
Multimodal components largely captured corresponding regions across modalities, and in
these instances (with the exception of IC3), GWC and thickness generally showed directional
weighting correspondence, which was opposite to surface area (i.e. higher thickness and
GWC with smaller surface area).
ANOVA on age residualized component loadings revealed that none of the
components were highly sensitive to scanner differences (Supplementary Table 3), with IC4
showing the only significant scanner effect (F= 4.3, adjusted p = <0.001).

Associations between multimodal components and age
Linear models revealed significant age associations for 17 of the 60 components when
including scanner in the model (Table 1, Supplementary Figure 5 and 6). The four
components with the strongest age effects are shown in Figure 2. With higher age, IC1
revealed globally lower GWC, IC3 globally lower thickness coupled with globally higher
GWC, and IC4 bilaterally lower GWC across large regions of the brain including cingulate,
insula, occipital, and pre- and post-central cortices extending into frontal regions, and higher

GWC in minor rostral middle frontal and temporal pole regions. IC15 revealed bilaterally
thicker precentral cortices, as well as thinner medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices
with higher age.

Associations between multimodal components and sex
Linear models revealed significant sex associations for 24 components when including age
and scanner in the models (Table 1, Supplementary Figure 5 and 6). The four components
with the strongest sex effects are shown in Figure 3. For boys as compared to girls IC2
revealed globally larger surface area, with strongest effects within prefrontal, occipital and
lateral temporal cortices, and IC15 bilaterally thinner precentral cortices, as well as thicker
medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices. Moreover, for boys as compared to girls
IC21 revealed larger lateral rostral prefrontal surface area, and smaller caudal prefrontal
surface area, and IC44 larger surface area within a bilateral, mainly medial occipital region.

Associations between multimodal components and PGS for neuroticism
In the white European ancestry sub-group (see Supplementary Table 1), linear models
including scanner, age, sex, and 4 genetic principal components representing population
stratification revealed no significant associations with any of the PCA-based PGS. The p<0.05
SNP selection threshold revealed a significant association between PGS for neuroticism with
IC23 (t= -4.2, adjusted p= 0.004), which seemed to be driven by the PGS for depressed affect
(t= -3.7, adjusted p= 0.016) (Figure 4). IC23 reflects a pattern with larger surface area within
a right hemisphere ventrolateral prefrontal region and smaller surface area within an adjacent
superior prefrontal region. There was no associations between the PGS worry scores
thresholded at 0.05 and any of the multimodal components.

Discussion
This multimodal structural brain imaging study of 2596 participants aged 3-23 years yielded
three main results. First, higher age was most strongly associated with lower global GWC,
with some regional variation. Higher age was also associated with globally thinner cortex, in
particular encompassing prefrontal regions. Second, several components showed sex
differences; boys had larger global and regional surface area compared to girls, and some
regional cortical thickness differences. Third, there was a significant association between
polygenic scores for neuroticism and a component encompassing surface area in prefrontal
regions in the right hemisphere.
The imaging component explaining the largest amount of variance was global and
dominated by GWC, indicating a prominent role of GWC in childhood and adolescent
neurodevelopment. Accordingly, several of the early components had substantial contribution
from GWC. Moreover, regions overlapping across modalities showed directional weighting
correspondence between GWC and thickness, which was the opposing direction to area. As
intracortical myelin is predominantly found in deeper cortical layers54, and our GM sampling
strategy was a percentage, sampling of thicker cortex may to a larger degree include voxels in
more superficial cortical layers. This could also result in a larger contrast between GM and
WM. Our results are also in accordance with prior reports of negative associations between
cortical thickness and surface area change9, 55.
Several imaging components were sensitive to age and, as hypothesized, the strongest
age associations were seen for components dominated by GWC and thickness. Converging
with prior studies13, 14, we found a negative association between age and a global GWC
component. This indicates that GM and WM intensities appear more similar with higher age.
Although a decidedly indirect measure, there is evidence supporting that the lowering of
GWC is partly due to brightening of cortex, which concurs with other cortical intensity

studies15, 49, possibly through the developmental process of intracortical myelination, which
continues across and beyond adolescence56. Moreover, a component capturing global cortical
thickness was also negatively associated with age, in line with previous studies8, 9, 40, 43, 57.
Intriguingly, the negative association between cortical thickness and age was co-modeled with
globally relatively higher GWC. This could be an addition to previous findings showing that
the apparent cortical thinning in development is due to an underestimation of the true cortical
thickness. The rationale is that axonal myelination mostly occur within deep cortical layers
where encroaching white matter penetrates the cortical neuropil57, 58. As myelin brightens the
appearance of the cortex, deep myelinated cortical layers could be misclassified as WM,
thereby shifting the grey/white boundary outward57, 59, 60. Indeed, a cross-sectional study
investigating magnetization transfer and cortical thickness in youths aged 14-24 reported that
association regions were thicker and less myelinated compared to primary sensory regions in
early adolescence, but that during development these regions had faster rates of thinning and
myelination61. Moreover, a recent study investigating GM and WM changes within visual
cortex using quantitative MRI and mean diffusivity, reported that tissue growth, and
specifically increased levels of myelin as verified by postmortem cortical data, underlay the
apparent cortical thinning in development58.
As hypothesized, sex differences were most pronounced for components
encompassing cortical surface area, and as previously reported, boys showed overall larger
surface area as compared to girls8. Beyond this scaling effect, boys had increases in regional
occipital and prefrontal surface area, as well as bilaterally thinner precentral cortices and
thicker medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices, as compared to girls. Prior studies
on cortical sex differences have been divergent62, but stable differences in surface area across
age is a consistent finding. The present study indicates that there are few sex differences in
GWC in youth.

Exploratory analyses on the associations between PGS for neuroticism and multimodal
modes of brain structural variation yielded limited findings. The results showed a
bidirectional association between PGS for neuroticism, as well as PGS for depressed affect,
and an imaging component capturing prefrontal surface area within the right hemisphere. One
prior study has investigated the association between PGS for neuroticism and brain structure
in adults, using a discovery (n ≈ 1000) and replication sample (n≈ 600). In the discovery
sample, PGS for neuroticism was associated with decreased regional surface area, including
within inferior frontal gyrus, which overlaps with the region reported in the current paper, but
this result was not replicated in the discovery sample37. Other studies have found associations
between phenotypic neuroticism and smaller frontal surface area63, 64, and in youth a positive
association between emotional stability and surface area, albeit in temporal lobe regions65.
However, a recent large-scale study (n ≈ 1000) attempting to detangle the inconsistent
findings within neuroimaging personality research, reported no significant associations
between any of the Big Five personality traits and any of the structural measures, including
cortical surface area or thickness 66.
The present study attempted to investigate the genetic disposition of- and not
phenotypic neuroticism, and it should be stated that PGS have been reported to explain little
of the known heritability in complex traits. PGS based on the GWAS used in the current paper
have been reported to explain a maximum of 4.2% of the variance in neuroticism34. Similarly,
a combined meta-analysis GWAS of neuroticism using almost 10,000 participants from the
UK Biobank cohort, as well as 2 separate replication cohorts, reported that PGS derived from
the UK Biobank sample only captured about 1% of the variance in neuroticism in the
replication cohorts. In addition, most of the genome-wide significant alleles were not
independently replicated 67. Furthermore, an attempt to apply PGS to split-half samples failed

to significantly predict any of the tested personality traits of the study, including neuroticism
68

.
There are several limitations to the current study. First, reported GWC associations

cannot be directly credited to myelination in general or intracortical myelination specifically.
Although cholesterol in myelin is a major determinant of T1-weighted signal intensity69, 70, so
in part is iron, water content and dendrite density71-73. While cortical GM intensity
corresponds closely with histologically based myelin profiles74, GWC is microstructurally
complex and a product of GM and WM. Intricate combinations of both matter types can
therefore produce changes in GWC. Second, the cross-sectional design is suboptimal for the
study of development75.
To conclude, our results indicated that in childhood and adolescence, GWC explains
more variance in brain structure across subjects than cortical thickness or surface area.
Further, negative age-related associations were found for global GWC and cortical thickness,
the latter in combination with regionally relatively higher GWC. These results are in
accordance with biological interpretations of intracortical myelination and an outward shifting
of the grey/white border with increasing age. Boys had larger global and regional cortical
surface area than girls, and there were also regional sex differences in cortical thickness.
Finally, we found weak bidirectional associations between PGS for neuroticism and regional
prefrontal surface area in the right hemisphere. Future developmental longitudinal studies are
needed to validate the consistency of the reported effects.

Table 1. Overview of age and sex effects on multimodal imaging components. The table
shows the T statistics for age (controlling for scanner) and sex (controlling for scanner and
age) effects on each independent component, as well as P-values adjusted for multiple
comparisons by false discovery rate correction. P-values at or below 0.05 are marked in bold.

Figures

Figure 1. Age and sex distribution for the full MRI sample (n=2596). (A) Depicts the age and
sex distribution for the full MRI sample, while (B) depicts the age distribution within each
scanner. Scanner 1-10 are scanners employed by the PING study, while scanner 11 was used
in the PNC.

Figure 2. Associations between age and multimodal imaging independent components (ICs).
The figure depicts FMRIB’s linked independent component analysis (FLICA) weighted
spatial maps for the four ICs with the strongest age associations. The accompanying plots
show linear models of age plotted against scanner residualized IC loading. In general, all
components were thresholded within a minimum and maximum of 8 and 17 standard
deviations (SD) respectively, except for the global maps within IC1, IC3 and IC4, which were
thresholded with a higher maximum SD value in order to reveal nuances in the global pattern.

Figure 3. Associations between sex and multimodal imaging independent components (ICs).
The figure depicts FMRIB’s linked independent component analysis (FLICA) weighted
spatial maps for the four ICs with the strongest effect of sex. The accompanying violin
boxplots shows sex plotted against scanner and age residualized IC loading. All components
were thresholded within a minimum and maximum of 8 and 17 standard deviations (SD)
respectively, except for the global map within IC2, which was thresholded with a higher
maximum SD value in order to reveal nuances in the global pattern.

Figure 4. Association between polygenic scores (PGS) for neuroticism and a single
multimodal imaging independent component (IC). The figure depicts FMRIB’s linked
independent component analysis (FLICA) weighted spatial maps for the IC with an effect of
PGS. The accompanying plots show linear models of PGS score plotted against scanner, age-,
sex, and population stratification- residualized IC loading. The IC was thresholded within a
minimum and maximum of 8 and 17 standard deviations (SD) respectively.
