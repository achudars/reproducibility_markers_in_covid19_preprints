ABSTRACT

10

Higher genetic gains can be achieved through genomic selection (GS) by shortening time of

11

progeny testing in tree breeding programs. Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), combined with

12

two imputation methods, allowed us to perform the current genomic prediction study in Scots

13

pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). 694 individuals representing 183 full-sib families were genotyped

14

and phenotyped for growth and wood quality traits. 8719 SNPs were used to compare different

15

genomic prediction models. In addition, the impact on the predictive ability (PA) and prediction

16

accuracy to estimate genomic breeding values was evaluated by assigning different ratios of

17

training and validation sets, as well as different subsets of SNP markers. Genomic Best Linear

18

Unbiased Prediction (GBLUP) and Bayesian Ridge Regression (BRR) combined with

19

expectation maximization (EM) imputation algorithm showed higher PAs and prediction

20

accuracies than Bayesian LASSO (BL). A subset of approximately 4000 markers was sufficient

21

to provide the same PAs and accuracies as the full set of 8719 markers. Furthermore, PAs were

22

similar for both pedigree- and genomic-based estimations, whereas accuracies and heritabilities

23

were slightly higher for pedigree-based estimations. However, prediction accuracies of

24

genomic models were sufficient to achieve a higher selection efficiency per year, varying

25

between 50-87% compared to the traditional pedigree-based selection.

INTRODUCTION

27

Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) is the most widely distributed pine in the world (Houston

28

Durrant et al. 2016; Mátyás et al. 2004). It is a highly important commercial species in Europe,

29

particularly in Northern countries (Krakau et al. 2013), being the second foremost species for

30

wood production in Sweden (The Swedish National Forest Inventory, 2015). The actual Scots

31

pine breeding program consists of a combination of several selection strategies, all of them

32

based on conventional progeny testing and breeding value prediction based on reliable

33

phenotypic assessments, at age of 10-15 years, and pedigree information, thus a breeding cycle

34

usually takes roughly 21 to 36 years, depending on the testing strategy and mating success

35

(Rosvall et al. 2011).

36
37

Genomic selection (GS) could potentially reduce the breeding cycle, by shortening field test

38

time through early selections based on GS predictions, and increasing selection intensities with

39

greater genetic gains per unit of time (Crossa et al. 2017; Isik 2014; Grattapaglia et al. 2018).

40

GS was firstly introduced by Meuwissen et al. (2001) and it consisted of using genome-wide

41

marker information to calculate genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV). The major

42

difference between GS and marker assisted selection (MAS) is that there is no need to detect

43

quantitative trait loci (QTL) prior to selection. To perform GS, a training set (TS) of individuals

44

that have been phenotyped and genotyped, generally through single nucleotide polymorphism

45

markers (SNPs), are used to develop prediction models to estimate GEBV, that are validated

46

through a validation set (VS) of individuals, or selection candidates, which are genetically

47

related to the TS and only have marker data for predicting their own breeding values

48

(Grattapaglia and Resende 2011).

50

Next generation sequencing technologies (NGS) have made it possible to discover thousands

51

of SNPs across the genome and thus make GS a routine application in animal and plant breeding

52

programs (Grattapaglia et al. 2018). SNP arrays had been shown as preferable for their

53

reproducibility, manageability and storage logistics, as well as their cost efficiency

54

(Grattapaglia et al. 2018). There are still challenges for forest tree species, such as Scots pine,

55

to develop genome-wide SNP panels or exome probe panels because of their large complex

56

genomes, and lack of a reference genome. Therefore, it is attractive to employ alternative

57

genotyping methods such as genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) (Chen et al. 2013; Elshire et al.

58

2011; Dodds et al. 2015). GBS uses restriction enzymes to reduce sequencing of complex

59

genomes and uses a barcoding system for multiplex sequencing, which increases its efficiency

60

and reduces the genotyping costs (He et al. 2014; Pan et al. 2015). GBS can generate very large

61

number of SNPs and produces large amount of missing data. The latter can be solved with the

62

aid of different imputation methods, such as mean imputation (MI), expectation maximization

63

(EM), family-based k-nearest neighbor (kNN-Fam) or singular value decomposition (SVD)

64

(Troyanskaya et al. 2001; Dempster et al. 1977). EM algorithm was especially designed for

65

GBS data (Endelman 2011; Poland et al. 2012). Genomic predictions based on GBS marker

66

information have been successfully studied in animal (Gorjanc et al. 2015), crop- (Poland et al.

67

2012; Crossa et al. 2013; Jarquin et al. 2014) and tree breeding (El-Dien et al. 2015; El-Dien

68

et al. 2018; Ratcliffe et al. 2015).

69
70

Accuracy of GS predictions can vary depending on the model selected. Currently different

71

statistical methods are available to estimate GEBV. Genomic best linear unbiased prediction

72

(GBLUP) consists of using the realized relationship matrix (G matrix), based on the marker

73

realized kinship relationship, replacing the traditional pedigree numerator relationship matrix

74

(A matrix) which is based on coancestry and the infinitesimal model in quantitative genetics,

75

assuming that QTL allelic effects are normally distributed and all have a similar contribution

76

to the genetic variance (Isik et al. 2017). On the contrary, most of the Bayesian approaches

77

presume a prior gamma or exponential distribution of QTL allelic effects, thus the variance at

78

each locus can vary (Meuwissen et al. 2001). For instance, Bayesian LASSO (BL) assumes that

79

variance follows a Laplace (or double exponential) distribution (Park and Casella 2008).

80

Nevertheless, Bayesian ridge regression (BRR) assigns QTL effects to a multivariate normal

81

prior distribution with a common variance, which is modelled hierarchically through a scaled

82

inverted chi-squared distribution (Perez et al. 2010; de los Campos et al. 2013; Isik et al. 2017).

83
84

Although Bayesian approaches may seem more appropriate as they can accommodate different

85

distributions of the allelic effects, the literature on GS in forest trees shows similar results for

86

all models. For instance, Chen et al. (2018a) observed similar prediction accuracies when

87

comparing four genomic prediction models (GBLUP, BRR, BL and reproducing kernel hilbert

88

space (RKHS)) in Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.). Isik et al. (2016) detected similar predictive

89

abilities in maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) comparing GBLUP, BRR and BL prediction

90

models. Although GBLUP and ridge regression BLUP (rrBLUP) were recommended by Tan

91

et al. (2017) for their computational advantages, similar predictive abilities were observed for

92

GBLUP, rrBLUP, BL and RKHS, in a Eucalyptus urophylla and E. grandis hybrid study. In an

93

interior spruce (Picea engelmannii  glauca) study, Ratcliffe et al. (2015) observed similar

94

accuracies for rrBLUP and BayesC, which in turn performed better than the generalized ridge

95

regression (GRR), whereas Thistlethwaite et al. (2017) observed almost identical predictions

96

with rrBLUP and GRR in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziensii Mirb. (Franco)). On the

97

contrary, Resende et al. (2012b) observed better PA for disease resistance in a loblolly pine

98

(Pinus taeda L.) study with Bayesian methods when compared with BLUP-based methods.

99

Despite these similar results from different studies carried out so far, it is still important to test

100

the prediction abilities and accuracies of the different genomic prediction models in different

101

species and traits, due to the possible differences in the genetic architecture of the traits.

102
103

Among the objective traits of the Scots pine breeding program are: the traditionally existing

104

growth traits, and the recently incorporated wood quality traits (Rosvall and Mullin 2013). The

105

goal of this investigation was to study the prediction power of SNP markers for growth and

106

wood quality traits in Scots pine. The specific objectives were to 1) estimate the predictive

107

ability and prediction accuracy of genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV), 2) compare the

108

efficiency of three different genomic prediction models (GBLUP, BL and BRR) in the

109

estimation of GEBV, 3) study the effect of two different imputation algorithms in the predictive

110

ability and prediction accuracy of GEBV and 4) compare the effect of different numbers of

111

SNPs obtained through GBS in the predictive ability and prediction accuracy of the genomic

112

predictions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

114

Plant material

115

In this study a Scots pine full-sib progeny trial (F261, Grundtjärn), belonging to the Swedish

116

tree improvement program at Skogforsk (the Forestry Research Institute of Sweden) was used.

117

The trial consists of 184 full-sib families and 7240 trees (F1-generation), generated from a

118

partial diallel mating design of 40 plus trees (F0-generation) and established in 1971 by

119

Skogforsk as a randomized single tree plot design, divided into 14 post-blocks (Ericsson 1997).

120

A more detailed information on the trial can be found in (Fries 2012). 694 progeny trees (F1)

121

from 183 families were selected for this study, such that the number of trees per family varied

122

from one to seven with an average of four individuals per family.

123
124

Phenotypic data and adjustments

125

Height (Ht) was measured when the trees were 10 (Ht1) and 30 (Ht2) years old. Diameter at

126

breast height (DBH) was also measured two times, at ages 30 (DBH1) and 36 (DBH2). In 2011,

127

increment cores at breast height were obtained from 694 trees, and processed by Silviscan

128

(Innventia AB, Stockholm, Sweden). From the Silviscan analysis, three traits were used in this

129

study: microfibril angle (MFA), static modulus of elasticity (MOEs) and wood mean density

130

(DEN). In addition, dynamic modulus of elasticity (MOEd) predicted by Hitman ST300 (Fiber-

131

gen, Christchurch, New Zealand) was as well used in the current study. All traits were further

132

described in Hong et al. (2014).

133

The following linear mixed model was applied to reduce the impact of environmental effects

134

for each trait:

𝐘 = 𝐗𝜷 + 𝐙𝒖 + 𝐖𝐛 + 𝒆 ,

136

where Y is the vector of individual tree observations of a single trait,  is the vector of fixed

137

effects (intercept), u is the vector of random effects (post-block and trial design parameters), b

138

is a vector of random additive genetic effect of individuals with a normal distribution, b ~ N(0,

139

A𝜎𝑏2 ), A is a matrix of additive genetic effects among individuals, 𝜎𝑏2 is the additive genetic

140

variance and and 𝒆 is the vector of residuals. X, Z and W are the incidence matrices for  , u

141

and b, respectively.

142

Adjusted values were obtained for MFA, MOEs, DEN and MOEd, by removing the variation

143

of the experimental design features and post-block effects. For growth traits (Ht1, Ht2 and

144

DBH1 and DBH2), spatial adjustments were performed using the row and column coordinates

145

in the trial. For modeling the residual structure, a model was fitted with only the experimental

146

design elements as factors (Dutkowski et al. 2006). If the spatial distribution of residuals were

147

non-random for any trait, a second model was fitted, such that the full residual component was

148

structured as

149

𝐑 = 𝜎𝜉2 [𝐀𝐑𝟏(𝜌𝑐𝑜𝑙 )⨂𝐀𝐑𝟏(𝜌𝑟𝑜𝑤 )] + 𝜎𝜂2 𝐈,

150

where 𝜎𝜉2 and 𝜎𝜂2 are spatially dependent and independent residual variances, respectively, ⨂

151

is the Kronecker product of two matrices, and 𝐴𝑅1(𝜌𝑐𝑜𝑙 ) and 𝐴𝑅1(𝜌𝑟𝑜𝑤 ) represent the first-

152

order autoregressive correlation matrix in the column and row directions, and I denotes the

153

identity matrix (Dutkowski et al. 2002; Ivkovic et al. 2015; Chen et al. 2018b). The adjusted

154

phenotypic data (predicted values of each tree) were used for genomic predictions.

Genotyping

157

DNA extraction

158

The commercial NucleoSpin Plant II kit (Machery-Nagel, Düren, Germany) was used to

159

extract genomic DNA from vegetative buds or needles from the 694 progeny trees and 46

160

parents. DNA concentration was determined with Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Invitrogen,

161

Carlsbad, CA, USA).

162

Genotyping-By-Sequencing (GBS) library preparation

163

Using 827 samples (replicates included) and PstI high fidelity restriction enzyme (New England

164

Biolabs, MA, USA), three genomic libraries for GBS were prepared following the procedure

165

described in Pan et al. (2015). The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000

166

platform at SciLifeLab, Sweden.

167

SNP calling and filtering

168

Paired-end raw reads of each GBS library were cleaned and demultiplexed by the

169

process_radtags module of Stacks v.1.40 (Catchen et al. 2011) on the basis of 300 barcodes

170

with 4–8 bp. Cleaned reads of each sample were aligned to the Pinus taeda v1.0 (Wegrzyn et

171

al. 2014) reference genome, using BWA mem v0.7.15 (Li and Durbin 2010) with default

172

parameters. Alignments were coordinate-sorted and indexed using Samtools v1.5 (Li et al.

173

2009). SNP markers were called using the mpileup command of Samtools over all the samples

174

simultaneously, with default parameters, and converted into VCF matrix using BCFtools

175

v0.1.19 (Narasimhan et al. 2016). Furthermore, these variants were sorted to keep only high-

176

quality SNPs. Using vcfutils in BCFtools with default parameters, the SNPs within 3bp around

177

an indel or with mapping quality < 20 were filtered out; using Vcftools v.0.1.12b (Danecek et

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/607648; this version posted April 12, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

178

al. 2011), only SNPs with coverage ≥ 5x, genotype quality (GQ) ≥ 30, genotype calling rate >

179

20% were kept; using the custom Perl program (ReplicateErrfilter.pl), discordant genotypes of

180

66 replicated samples were detected and the SNP sites with ≥ 3 replicate errors were filtered

181

out. After this step, 24,152 informative SNP markers were retained.

182

Imputation of missing genotypic data

183

Missing genotypic data were imputed with TASSEL 5 (Bradbury et al. 2007) using LD K-

184

nearest neighbor (Money et al. 2015) as a baseline method. After this imputation, two extra

185

imputations were performed to compare their prediction accuracies; random (RND) imputation

186

with the codeGeno function in synbreed package (Wimmer et al. 2012) in R (R Core Team

187

2016) and imputation with the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm by the A.mat function

188

implemented in rrBLUP package (Endelman 2011) in R. A total of 15,537 and 15,433 SNPs

189

with minor allele frequency (MAF) lower than 1% and with a missing data threshold lower than

190

10% were removed using RND and EM imputation methods, respectively.

191
192

Statistical analysis for genomic predictions

193

Among all the available approaches to perform genomic predictions we selected genomic best

194

linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP), Bayesian ridge regression (BRR) and Bayesian LASSO

195

(BL) regression, to estimate genomic breeding values (GEBV) and to evaluate the ability to

196

predict them. ABLUP and GBLUP calculations were performed in ASReml 4.1. (Gilmour et

197

al. 2015) whereas BRR and BL were implemented using the BGLR function from the BGLR

198

package in R (Perez and de los Campos 2014).

ABLUP and GBLUP

200

Estimated breeding values (EBV) and GEBV were predicted using the following model

201

𝐲 = 𝐗𝐛 + 𝐙𝐚 + 𝐞

202

where y is the vector of the adjusted phenotypic data for each trait, b is the vector of fixed

203

effects (mean), a is the vector of random effects and e is the vector of residual effects, which is

204

assumed to follow a normal distribution as var(e)~N(0, I𝜎𝑒2 ), where 𝜎𝑒2 is the residual variance

205

and I is the identity matrix. X and Z are the incident matrices of b and a.

206

ABLUP is the method traditionally used to predict EBV, based on pedigree relationships

207

between individuals. In ABLUP, the vector a (additive genetic effects) from Eq.1 is assumed

208

to follow a normal distribution with expectations of ~N(0, A𝜎𝑎2 ), where 𝜎𝑎2 is the additive

209

genetic variance and A is the additive numerator relationship matrix.

210

GBLUP was performed using Eq.1. This method is derived from ABLUP but differs in that the

211

A matrix in now substituted by a genomic relationship matrix, known as realized relationship

212

matrix (G matrix), estimated according to VanRaden (2008).

213

G=

214

where M is the matrix of genotyped samples, P is the matrix of allele frequencies with the jth

215

column given by 2(𝑝𝑗 − 0.5), where 𝑝𝑗 is the observed allele frequencies of the genotyped

216

samples. The elements of M were coded as 0, 1 and 2 (i.e., the number of minor alleles) for the

217

estimation of the G matrix with function kin from the synbreed package in R in the case of

218

RND imputed data and with the function A.mat from the rrBLUP package in R, for the EM

219

imputed data. The a effects from Eq.1, were assumed to follow a normal distribution with

expectations of ~ N(0,G𝜎𝑔2 ), where 𝜎𝑔2 is the genetic variance explained by the markers effect

221

and G is the realized relationship matrix, in GBLUP (Isik et al. 2017).

222

Bayesian Ridge Regression (BRR)

223

In BRR, vector a from Eq.1 is assigned a multivariate normal prior distribution with a common

224

2
2
variance to all marker effects, that is 𝒂~𝑁(0, 𝐼𝑝 𝜎𝑚
), where p is the number of markers, 𝜎𝑚
is

225

the unknown genetic variance which is contributed by each marker and assigned as

226

2
𝜎𝑚
~𝜒 −2 (𝑑𝑓𝑚 , 𝑆𝑚 ), where 𝑑𝑓𝑚 is degrees of freedom and 𝑆𝑚 is the scale parameter. Residual

227

variance is assigned as 𝜎𝑒2 ~𝜒 −2 (𝑑𝑓𝑒 , 𝑆𝑒 ), with 𝑑𝑓𝑒 degrees of freedom and scale parameter for

228

residual variance 𝑆𝑒 (Perez et al. 2010).

229

Bayesian LASSO (BL) regression

230

BL method assumes that vector a from Eq.1 follows a hierarchical prior distribution with

231

2 ),
𝒂~𝑁(0, 𝑇𝜎𝑚
where 𝐓 = diag(𝜏12 , … , 𝜏𝑝2 ). 𝜏𝑗2 is assigned as 𝜏𝑗2 ~𝐸𝑥𝑝(𝜆2 ), 𝑗 = 1, … , 𝑝. 𝜆2 is

232

assigned as 𝜆2 ~𝐺𝑎𝑚𝑚𝑎(𝑟, 𝛿). Finally, the residual variance is assigned as 𝜎𝑒2 ~𝜒 −2 (𝑑𝑓𝑒 , 𝑆𝑒 ),

233

where 𝑑𝑓𝑒 is degrees of freedom and 𝑆𝑒 is the scale parameter for residual variance (Park and

234

Casella 2008).

235

Model convergence and prior sensitivity analysis

236

Bayesian algorithms were extended using Gibbs sampling for estimation of variance

237

components. The Gibbs sampler was run for 20,000 iterations with a burn-in of 1,000 iterations

238

and a thinning interval of 100. The convergence of the posterior distribution was verified using

239

trace plots. Flat priors were given to all models.

Cross validation, prediction accuracy and predictive ability of the models

241

We performed 10-fold cross-validation, i.e., 90% of individuals in the training set (TS) and

242

10% in the validation set (VS), for all traits and models (ABLUP, GBLUP, BRR and BL),

243

except to test the different sizes of TS and VS. In addition, for each of the genomic prediction

244

models, two different imputation methods (EM and RND) were evaluated.

245

For the Bayesian methods, GEBV in the validation set (VS) were estimated as,

246

247

where 𝑍′𝑖𝑗 is the indicator covariate (-1, 0, 1) for the ith tree at the jth locus and 𝑎̂𝑗 is the estimated

248

effect at the jth locus.

249

Models were evaluated based on their predictive ability (PA) and prediction accuracy

250

(Accuracy). In our study, PA was defined as the Pearson product-moment correlation between

251

the cross-validated GEBVs and the adjusted phenotypes (y) from Eq. 1, i.e., 𝑟(𝐺𝐸𝐵𝑉, 𝐲) and

252

Accuracy was defined as the Pearson product-moment correlation between the cross-validated

253

GEBVs and the EBVs estimated from ABLUP using all adjusted phenotypes, i.e.,

254

𝑟(𝐺𝐸𝐵𝑉, 𝐸𝐵𝑉).

255

Effect of the relative size on training and validation sets

256

The effect on the PA and prediction accuracy, of five different size ratio of TS and VS, was

257

evaluated. The relative size of TS and VS were established dividing the 694 individuals in five

258

different proportions of TS/VS. That is 90%, 80%, 70%, 60% and 50% for TS and the rest as

259

VS. For each trait and each of the 20 models, 10 replicates were performed.

Effect of marker number on accuracies

261

Due to the better predictions obtained with the BRR-EM model from cross-validation results,

262

BRR-EM model was selected to test the effect of the number of SNPs on the PA and prediction

263

accuracy. From all available SNPs, we randomly selected 14 sets of SNPs.

264

Heritability estimation

265

Pedigree-based narrow sense-heritability (ℎ𝑎2 ) and genomic narrow-sense heritability (ℎ𝑔2 )

266

were estimated as

267

ℎ𝑎2 = 𝜎2𝑎 and ℎ𝑔2 = 𝜎2𝑔

268

2
where 𝜎𝑎2 and 𝜎𝑔2 are the pedigree- and genomic-based additive genetic variances and 𝜎𝑝𝑎
and

269

2
𝜎𝑝𝑔
are phenotypic variances estimated using ABLUP and GBLUP, respectively.

270

Relative selection efficiency of GS

271

Assuming that selection response is inversely proportional to the length of the breeding cycle

272

(Grattapaglia and Resende 2011), the relative efficiency (RE) of GS to the traditional pedigree-

273

based selection (TPS) can be estimated as

274

𝑅𝐸 = 𝑟(𝐸𝐵𝑉

275

consequently the RE per year (RE/year) can be estimated as

276

𝑅𝐸⁄𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟 =

277

where CLTPS and CLGS are the breeding cycle lengths of TPS and GS, respectively.

278

In order to estimate RE, we assumed that with GS approaches the cycle could be reduced by

279

50%.

RESULTS

285

Prediction accuracy and predictive ability of the different models

286

PAs and prediction accuracies from the 10-fold cross-validation were obtained for each

287

model (ABLUP, GBLUP, BRR and BL) and imputation method (Table 1). ABLUP

288

performed best in terms of prediction accuracy. Among the genomic prediction models,

289

different models produced higher accuracies for various traits. There was no single

290

genomic prediction model that fit to all the traits best. In the case of PAs, ABLUP did not

291

showed the highest PA for almost any of the traits. Depending on the trait, the superiority

292

of the models varied for PAs. ABLUP showed higher PA for DEN (0.41); however, it was

293

only slightly higher than PAs obtained with most other models (0.40 in all cases).

294

In summary, although the best accuracies were observed with ABLUP for all traits,

295

genomic prediction models produced higher PAs for all traits. Moreover, all the genomic

296

prediction models showed similar PAs and prediction accuracies for all traits, being slightly

297

higher when EM imputation method was combined with GBLUP, BRR or BL.

298

Relative size effect of the training and validation sets

299

To test the size effect of different ratios of TS and VS, EM imputation method was used,

300

in combination with ABLUP, GBLUP and BRR since it showed the best PAs and

301

accuracies in our previous 10-fold cross validation.

302

All three models showed a similar but increasing patterns of PA for different traits with the

303

increase of TS percentages (Fig. 1A). GBLUP and ABLUP showed the highest PAs for

Page 18 of 45

304

almost all traits, when 70% of the individuals were assigned to the TS; however, BRR

305

needed a higher percentage of individuals assigned to the TS to reach the highest PA.

306

Among the three methods, ABLUP had the best prediction accuracies for all eight traits

307

under all TS ratios (Fig. 1B). BRR and GBLUP showed similar accuracies. To reach the

308

highest prediction accuracies, 80-90% of individuals in the TS were needed for all traits

309

for BRR method, whereas GBLUP needed a subsample pf 70% or 80% individuals as TS

310

for almost all traits. The computational time needed to perform the analysis as the subset

311

of individuals increased, was substantially longer with Bayesian models.

312

In brief, the sensitivity analysis suggested that using about 70-80% of individuals sampled

313

from the studied population would produce similar PA and accuracy as the full sample size,

314

for the growth and wood quality traits.

315

Effect of increasing number of marker on accuracies

316

The impact of the different subsets of SNPs was tested based on BRR-EM model that was

317

the model with higher PA and accuracy from the previous 10-fold cross-validation.

318

Accuracies and PAs increased for all traits as the number of SNPs increased (Fig. 2).

319

However, for almost all traits, the greatest increase on prediction accuracy was attained

320

when the subset of markers was 1000 SNPs. Accuracy continued slightly increasing, for

321

all traits with subsets of SNPs higher than 1K, but the increase slowed after 3K – 4K SNPs,

322

reaching the maximum accuracies at 3K for DBH1, 4K for Ht1 and MOEs, 7K for DEN

323

and MOEd, and 8K for Ht2, DBH2 and MFA.

Page 19 of 45

324

PA followed a similar pattern; however, it decreased at a subset of 2K SNPs for Ht1, Ht2

325

and DBH1 to continue increasing until a subset of 3K SNPs where it stagnated until it

326

reached the maximum of 8719 SNPs. For DBH2, PA decreased at a subset of 4K SNPs and

327

kept constant for the following subset of SNPs. The PA of wood traits showed an increase

328

trend as the number of SNPs rise up, until they reach a plateau at around a subset of SNPs

329

that vary from 4K to 6K depending on the trait. In short, from the subset of 3K-4K SNPs

330

we did not detect any considerable increase in the accuracies and PA of any of the traits

331

except MFA and MOEs for which we detected an increase at the subset of 2K SNPs that

332

kept more or less constant until the final subset of 8719 SNPs.

333

Heritabilities

334

Narrow sense heritabilities estimates based on ABLUP were higher than those based on

335

GBLUP, except for DBH2 which was higher for GBLUP (Table 2). MOEs showed the

336

same heritability both for ABLUP and GBLUP-EM. GBLUP heritability estimates

337

calculated from the realized relationship matrix derived from EM imputation method were

338

higher than those derived from the RND imputation method, for almost all traits, except

339

Ht1 and MOEd. Standard errors were similar for growth traits regardless the BLUP method

340

used but they were always lower when derived from GBLUP method. Based on GBLUP,

341

we observed that traits with heritability estimates equal or lower than 0.25, such as, Ht1,

342

DBH1, DBH2 or MFA, showed estimates of PA below 0.30, while those with heritabilities

343

of approximately 0.40 (Ht2, MOEs, DEN and MOEd) had PA estimations of about 0.40.

344

Moreover, we detected positive linear correlation between PA and trait heritabilities

345

(r=0.99, p<0.0001), but not between accuracies and heritabilities (r=0.22, p=0.6) (Fig. 3).

Page 20 of 45

346

Relative selection efficiency of GS

347

The relative genomic selection efficiency (RE) and relative genomic selection efficiency

348

per year (RE/year) were estimated in the genomic selection models, using three models

349

(GBLUP, BRR and BL) and the EM imputation. The Swedish Scots pine breeding cycle

350

combines several selection strategies and we divided in two groups, according to their

351

lengths (Rosvall et al. 2011). For the first group of strategies, which is basically seedling

352

backward selection, the cycle length takes up to 36 years. For such strategies, flowering

353

time needs to be included in the cycle length. In order to estimate RE, we assumed that

354

with GS approaches the cycle could be reduced by 50% to 18 years, since 15 years is the

355

starting age for female flowering in Scots pine (Mátyás et al. 2004). The cycle length for

356

the second group of strategies (forward selection and open-pollinated backward selection)

357

takes about 21 years and we assumed to shorten this breeding cycle, by 50% as well (11

358

years) by reducing progeny testing. Both RE and RE/year for both groups of strategies,

359

were estimated.

360

The RE/year increased for all traits and models when reducing the breeding cycle by 50%

361

(Table 3). Among the genomic prediction models, highest RE/year were obtained for

362

GBLUP and BRR, which in addition, were slightly higher for the first group of selection

363

strategies than for the second one. The first group of strategies showed RE/year that varied

364

between 66-85% with GBLUP, 57-90% with BRR, and 59-83% with BL, depending on

365

the trait. Within the second group of selection strategies we observed that the RE/year

366

ranged between 59-77% for GBLUP, 50-81% for BRR and 52-75% for BL, again

Page 21 of 45

367

depending on the trait. In summary, for all traits and genomic prediction models, RE/year

368

exceeded 50% when the breeding cycle was reduced by 50%.

369

DISCUSSION

370

After the genomic selection (GS) concept was proposed in 2001 (Meuwissen et al 2001),

371

genomic prediction studies were initially implemented in dairy cattle. The technology was

372

adopted in crop and tree breeding in the last decade. The execution of GS in animal and

373

crop breeding programs, such as dairy cattle, oat, maize and wheat, increased genetic gains

374

(Meuwissen et al. 2016; Crossa et al. 2017). Implementation of GS in tree breeding is

375

underway with recent publications in eucalypts (Tan et al 2017), white spruce (Beaulieu et

376

al 2014), black spruce (Lenz et al 2017), interior spruce (Ratcliffe et al. 2015), Norway

377

spruce (Chen et al 2018a), loblolly (Resende et al 2012a, 2012b) and maritime pine (Isik

378

et al 2016). However, genomic prediction studies and new genotyping platforms still need

379

to be developed for many species (Grattapaglia et al. 2018). To our knowledge, this is the

380

first genomic prediction study performed in Scots pine.

381

Marker imputation for GBS data

382

For species such as Scots pine, with large and complex genomes (Neale and Kremer 2011)

383

but without a reference genome, and with no SNP chips or exome panels developed,

384

genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) method is considered as an attractive alternative to

385

perform GS or GWAS studies. When using GBS data, large amounts of missing data are

386

produced, thus filtering and imputation SNPs are critical steps (Dodds et al. 2015). In an

387

interior spruce genomic prediction study with GBS data, El-Dien et al. (2015) observed

388

that the imputation method used had influence in the quality of predictions and concluded

389

that EM and kNN-Fam imputation methods, provided the highest genomic prediction

Page 23 of 45

390

accuracies. EM was as well the most accurate imputation method in a wheat breeding GS

391

study (Poland et al. 2012) with GBS data. Our study support those findings, since among

392

our genomic prediction models we observed more accurate predictions when EM

393

imputation algorithm was used instead of RND imputation, regardless of the genomic

394

prediction model used.

395

Accuracy and predictive ability of GS prediction

396

Traits of interest in tree breeding programs have different genetic architecture; thus,

397

different genomic prediction models to evaluate PA and prediction accuracy must still be

398

studied. Isik et al. (2016) observed similar PAs for GBLUP, BRR and BL for growth and

399

stem straightness traits in a two generations genomic prediction study, in maritime pine;

400

however, they found larger bias when BL was used. In a another study with three

401

generations of maritime pine larger bias was detected for ABLUP than for GBLUP or BL

402

(Bartholome et al. 2016). Several statistical methods, namely, GBLUP, BRR, BL and

403

reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), were compared in a Norway spruce study (Chen

404

et al. 2018a) where similar prediction accuracies were observed for all of them. rrBLUP,

405

GRR and BayesC predictions were compared for interior spruce (Ratcliffe et al. 2015),

406

concluding that all methods had similar accuracies although slightly lower for GRR.

407

Congruent with those studies we observed that for wood and growth traits in Scots pine,

408

largest accuracies were obtained with ABLUP for all traits, whereas GBLUP, BL and BRR

409

had similar PAs and accuracies. For instance, accuracies reported in Douglas fir

410

(Thistlethwaite et al. 2017), were very similar for height at early age (0.87-0.91) and

411

mature age (0.80 – 0.89), as well as for density (0.94 – 0.96), regardless of the genomic

Page 24 of 45

412

prediction model used, whereas in Eucalyptus nitents (Suontama et al. 2018), prediction

413

accuracies reported for density (0.74 – 0.79), diameter (0.29 – 0.51) and height (0.29 –

414

0.51) were slightly lower. Our accuracy estimations for MFA and MOE are similar to those

415

reported for MFA in white spruce (0.71) and MOE in Norway spruce (0.70-0.76), by

416

Beaulieu et al. (2014) and Chen et al. (2018a), respectively. In addition, PAs for Ht, DBH,

417

MFA and MOE were similar to those reported in Norway spruce, black spruce (Picea

418

mariana) or eucalyptus hybrids (Tan et al. 2017; Chen et al. 2018a; Lenz et al. 2017).

419

However, they were slightly lower than those reported for diameter and height in maritime

420

pine (Isik et al. 2016).

421

Effects of the training and validation set sizes

422

Our results differed from previous studies which stated that predictive ability and

423

prediction accuracy increased as the size of the training set increased. For instance, Tan et

424

al. (2017) detected that PA increased as the TS size increased without reaching any plateau

425

for all models and traits evaluated in Eucalyptus hybrids. Similarly, Lenz et al. (2017)

426

asserted that accuracy increased as the TS size increased, however after assigning TS of

427

45% individuals or more, the accuracy increase was not as important. Nevertheless, we

428

found some similarities between other studies, in which the accuracy increased as the TS

429

size increased but reaching a plateau for height when TS reached 80% of individuals and

430

75% of individuals for wood quality traits (Chen et al. 2018a). In the current study, the

431

highest PA and accuracy was obtained when TS size was between 70-80% of the trees,

432

depending on the trait. From those studies, we know, as well, that the number of trees per

Page 25 of 45

433

family have an effect on the GS efficiency; however, we could observe the advantage of

434

applying GS prediction methods, even when the number of trees per family were low.

435

Marker number effects

436

In a general conifer breeding program simulation study, Li and Dungey (2018) detected an

437

increase in the accuracy of GEBV for traits with low and high heritability when the subset

438

of SNPs increased from 7K to 90K, for a training population with 1000 clones from five

439

simulated generations. Moreover, the same pattern was observed in Norway spruce (Chen

440

et al. 2018a), where the accuracy increased with number of markers reaching a plateau

441

between 4K and 8K markers. On the contrary, for black spruce, Lenz et al. (2017) did not

442

find an remarkable decrease in prediction accuracies when markers were reduced randomly

443

from 5K to 1K; nonetheless, when markers were further reduced to 500, the accuracy

444

decreased dramatically. Tan et al. (2017) noted a greater impact of the number of SNPs

445

than their genomic location in the predictive ability, for both GBLUP and RKHS. In the

446

same study, they also observed a stronger reduction in the PA when the subset of SNPs

447

dropped below 5K, and that traits with lower heritabilities were more sensitive to the

448

reduction in the number of SNPs.

449

The results in this study are in accordance with previous studies (Tan et al. 2017; Lorenz

450

et al. 2011; Chen et al. 2018a) that GBLUP is preferable for large SNP markers datasets,

451

since the Bayesian approaches are computationally demanding, as long as there are no

452

major QTL effects in the study. In the current study 3K to 4K SNP were required to reach

453

a similar efficiency to that achieved when using all 8719 SNPs.

Page 26 of 45

454

Heritabilities

455

Bartholome et al. (2016) stated that no clear pattern was detected between accuracy and

456

heritability estimates for maritime pine. Additionally, Grattapaglia and Resende (2011) and

457

Chen et al. (2018a) observed that heritability impact on prediction accuracies is relatively

458

insignificant, therefore the former authors recommended that larger training sets should

459

be used for traits with lower heritabilities. Whereas no trend was detected among prediction

460

accuracies and trait heritabilities, we noted a positive linear trend among PA and

461

heritabilities, i.e., traits with lower heritabilities (below 0.25) exhibited the lowest PA while

462

higher PA were detected for traits with moderate heritabilities (above 0.30). This is

463

congruent with the positive correlation between trait heritabilities and PA indicated by

464

Resende et al. (2012b) in loblolly pine, that showed a positive trend between trait

465

heritabilities and PA. Similarly, traits with low heritabilities had lower predictive ability in

466

a maritime pine study (Isik et al. 2016). Chen et al. (2018a) in their Norway spruce study

467

concluded that narrow-sense heritability was more similar to PA than to prediction

468

accuracy, as PA involves both phenotypic and genetic values.

469

Relative selection efficiency

470

A simulation study conducted by Grattapaglia and Resende (2011) showed that when the

471

breeding cycle length was reduced by 50%, the RE/year doubled, and that when the cycle

472

length was reduced by 75% the RE/year reached 3 folds at high marker levels. This theory

473

was confirmed by Resende et al. (2012a) that by reducing 50% the loblolly pine breeding

474

cycle, obtained an increase in the RE/year between 53-92% for DBH and 58-112% for Ht,

475

compared to the traditional pedigree-based selection. Similarly RE varied between 106%

Page 27 of 45

476

to 139% for Ht when the breeding cycle length of interior spruce was reduced by 25%

477

(Ratcliffe et al. 2015). In Norway spruce, the RE/year of MOE increased between 69 –

478

83% when the cycle length was also shortened by 50% (Chen et al. 2018a). Our results

479

exhibited the same pattern for growth and wood quality traits, with a RE/year ranging

480

between 50 – 90%, with a reduction of the cycle length of 50%.

481
482

CONCLUSIONS

483

Our results provides an initial perspective of the use of genomic prediction in Scots pine

484

and are encouraging to develop GS strategies for the species. Similar predictive abilities

485

and accuracies among all genomic prediction models were observed, suggesting that the

486

traits are under additive genetic control. Due to both the computational and predictive

487

efficiency, GBLUP was the most effective method to perform genomic predictions for both

488

growth and wood quality traits in Scots pine. The main advantage of GS in Scots pine is

489

the possibility of reducing of the breeding cycle. Our study showed that GS could

490

potentially reduce the breeding cycle by half, and under that assumption, the relative

491

genomic selection efficiency could be as high as 90% depending on the selection strategy

492

and the trait.

493

The results presented here are based on a relatively small population with a shallow

494

pedigree. More studies using different populations, preferably populations with deeper

495

pedigrees should be carried out to better understand the predictive power of SNP markers

496

for traits with complex inheritance patterns in the species. The predictive power of SNP

497

markers should be tested over two generations as suggested by Isik (2014) because the

Page 28 of 45

498

marker-QTL phase is expected to change once the population undergoes through breeding,

499

due to recombination of homologue chromosomes during the meiosis.
