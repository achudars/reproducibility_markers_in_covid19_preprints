Abstract
Impairment of mitochondrial structure and function is strongly linked to glaucoma pathogenesis.
Despite the widely appreciated disease relevance of mitochondrial dysfunction and loss, the
molecular mechanisms underlying mitochondrial fragmentation and metabolic stress in
glaucoma are poorly understood. We demonstrate here that glaucomatous retinal ganglion cells
(RGCs) show loss of A-kinase anchoring protein 1 (AKAP1), activation of calcineurin (CaN)
and reduction of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) phosphorylation at serine 637 (S637). These
findings suggest that AKAP1-mediated phosphorylation of Drp1 at S637 has a critical role in
RGC survival in glaucomatous neurodegeneration. Male mice lacking AKAP1 show increases
of CaN and total Drp1 level, as well as a decrease of Drp1 phosphorylation at S637 in the retina.
Ultrastructural analysis of mitochondria shows that loss of AKAP1 triggers mitochondrial
fragmentation and loss, as well as mitophagosome formation in RGCs. Loss of AKAP1
deregulates oxidative phosphorylation complexes (Cxs) by increasing CxII and decreasing CxIIIV, leading to metabolic and oxidative stress. Also, loss of AKAP1 decreases Akt
phosphorylation at S473 and activates the Bim/Bax signaling pathway in the retina. These
results suggest that loss of AKAP1 has a critical role in RGC dysfunction by decreasing Drp1
dephosphorylation at S637, deregulating OXPHOS, decreasing Akt phosphorylation and
activating the Bim/Bax pathway in glaucomatous neurodegeneration. Thus, we propose that
overexpression of AKAP1 or modulation of Drp1 phosphorylation at S637 are potential
therapeutic strategies for neuroprotective intervention in glaucoma and other mitochondriarelated optic neuropathies.

Introduction
Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is characterized by a slow and progressive degeneration
of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their axons, leading to loss of visual function1. The factors
contributing to degeneration of the RGC and its axon degeneration in POAG are not well
understood. Recent studies have shown that POAG patients have mitochondrial abnormalities2-7.
Evidence from our group and others indicates that compromised mitochondrial dynamics,
metabolic stress and mitochondrial dysfunction by glaucomatous insults such as elevated
intraocular pressure (IOP) and oxidative stress are critical to RGC loss in experimental
glaucoma8-19. Despite the widely appreciated disease relevance of mitochondrial dysfunction
and loss, the molecular mechanisms underlying the impairment of mitochondrial structure and
function in glaucoma are poorly understood.
A-kinase anchoring protein 1 (AKAP1), a scaffold protein, is part of the elaborate
architecture which binds to the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) along with other
signaling molecules such as Src kinase, protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), Ca2+-dependent
phosphatase calcineurin (CaN) and phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4)20-26. By recruiting the PKA
holoenzyme to the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), AKAP1 is strategically positioned to
integrate multiple signal transduction cascades, including cyclic adenosine 3´5´-monophosphate
(cAMP) signaling, in the regulation of mitochondrial shape and function. AKAP1 facilitates
dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) phosphorylation and subsequent mitochondrial elongation. It
also increases adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation and mitochondrial membrane
potential27,28, and these collective changes are neuroprotective 29,30. Emerging evidence
indicates that AKAP1 protects from cerebral ischemic stroke by maintaining respiratory chain
activity, inhibiting Drp1 dependent mitochondrial fission and superoxide production, and
delaying Ca2+ deregulation 30.
Excessive mitochondrial fission-mediated dysfunction has been implicated in various
neurodegenerative diseases including glaucoma8,31-34. Complexes of Drp1 assemble from the
cytosol onto mitochondria at focal sites of mitochondrial fission35,36. Recent evidence indicates
that post-translational modifications of Drp1 are linked to mitochondrial dysfunction-mediated
bioenergetic failure, synaptic injury and neuronal cell death31,32,37-39. Phosphorylation of Drp1 at
serine 637 (S637) by the cAMP-dependent PKA promotes mitochondrial fusion, whereas
dephosphorylation by the CaN promotes mitochondrial fission by decreasing Drp1 activity40-42.

Previous studies showed that inhibition of Drp1 activity prevents mitochondrial fission and
protects RGCs and their axons in experimental glaucoma14,43,44. However, it remains unknown
whether AKAP1-mediated Drp1 phosphorylation at S637 play a critical role in glaucomatous
neurodegeneration. Along this line, the existence of AKAP1 in RGCs and its role in glaucoma
are completely unknown.
To address these questions, we investigated AKAP1 protein expression and Drp1
phosphorylation at S637 in retinas from glaucomatous DBA/2J mice, and also evaluated the
effect of AKAP1 loss in the retina using AKAP1 knockout (AKAP1-/-) mice.

Results
AKAP1 deficiency in glaucomatous RGCs.
To determine whether AKAP1 is altered in glaucomatous RGCs that were induced by IOP
elevation, we examined AKAP1 protein expression in the retina of a mouse model of glaucoma
DBA/2J mice, which spontaneously develop elevated IOP and glaucomatous damage with
age8,14,45 using Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses. Control DBA/2J-Gpnmb+/SjJ
(D2-Gpnmb+) was used in which the gene for Gpnmb that has been altered to wild type sequence
by targeted gene mutation. It is otherwise identical to the DBA/2J mouse strain, but maintains
normal IOP during aging and does not develop optic nerve axon loss46,47. Our results
demonstrated for the first time that elevated IOP significantly decreased AKAP1 protein
expression in the retinas of 10-month-old glaucomatous DBA/2J mice compared with agematched control D2-Gpnmb+ mice (Fig. 1a). We observed that AKAP1 immunoreactivity was
highly present in the outer plexiform layer (OPL) and ganglion cell layer (GCL) in D2-Gpnmb+
mice (Fig. 1b). More specifically, AKAP1 immunoreactivity was colocalized with neuronal
class III β-tubulin (TUJ1)-positive RGCs in the GCL of D2-Gpnmb+ mice. Of interest, however,
AKAP1 immunoreactivity was decreased in the OPL and TUJ1-positive RGCs in the GCL of
glaucomatous DBA/2J mice compared with D2-Gpnmb+ mice (Fig. 1b).
CaN-mediated dephosphorylation of Drp1 at S637 in glaucomatous retina
AKAP1 binds with two Serine/Threonine phosphatases, protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and
calcineurin (CaN)48,49. Loss of AKAP1 causes Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission and
decreases phosphorylation of Drp1at serine 637 (S637) in neuronal cells of the brain27,29,30,50,51.
More importantly, AKAP1 protects brain neuronal cells against cerebral ischemic stroke by
inhibiting Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission30. Since elevated IOP increased CaN and total
Drp1 protein expression14,52, as well as Drp1 inhibition rescued RGCs and their axons by
preserving mitochondrial integrity in the retina and/or glial lamina of glaucomatous DBA/2J
mice14, we examined the expression levels of CaN and total Drp1, as well as phosphorylation of
Drp1 at S637 in the retina of of 10-month-old glaucomatous DBA/2J mice using Western blot
and immunohistochemical analyses. We observed a significant increase of CaN protein level in
the retina of glaucomatous DBA/2J mice compared with age-matched control D2-Gpnmb+ mice
(Fig. 2a). Consistently, immunohistochemical analysis showed an increase of CaN

immunoreactivity in RNA-binding protein with multiple splicing (RBPMS)-positive RGCs as
well as neurons in the inner nuclear layer (INL) of glaucomatous DBA/2J mice compared with
D2-Gpnmb+ mice (Fig. 2b). We observed a significant increase of total Drp1 protein levels in
the retina of glaucomatous DBA/2J mice compared with D2-Gpnmb+ mice (Fig. 2c). Following
the normalization of phospho-Drp1-S637 by total Drp1, however, we oberved a significant
decrease of Drp1 phosphorylation at S637 in the retina of glaucomatous DBA/2J mice (Fig. 2c).
Consistently, immunohistochemical analysis showed an increase of Drp1 immunoreactivity in
TUJ1-positive RGCs of glaucomatous DBA/2J mice compared with D2-Gpnmb+ mice (Fig. 2d).
These results suggest that elevated IOP triggers CaN-dependent dephosphorylation of Drp1 at
S637 in glaucomatous RGCs, leading to mitochondrial fragmentation14.
Loss of AKAP1 triggers CaN-mediated dephosphorylation of Drp1 at S637 in the retina
To determine whether loss of AKAP1 directly alters CaN and total Drp1 protein expression, as
well as Drp1 phosphorylation in the retina, we used the retinas from mice lacking AKAP1
(AKAP1-/-)30 and examined the expression levels of CaN and total Drp1, as well as
phosphorylation of Drp1-S637 and S616 using Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses.
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that AKAP1 gene expression was significantly
decreased in the retina of AKAP1-/- mice (Fig. 3a). We observed a significant increase of CaN
protein expression in the retina of AKAP1-/- mice compared with wild-type (WT) mice (Fig. 3b).
Consistent with this finding, increased CaN immunoreactivity was present in RBPMS-positive
RGCs as well as neurons in the INL in AKAP1-/- mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 3c).
Interestingly, we observed a significant increase of total Drp1 protein expression in the retina of
AKAP1-/- mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 4a). Following the normalization of phosphoDrp1-S637 and S616 by total Drp1, we also observed that AKAP1 loss induced a significant
decrease of Drp1-S637 in the retina of AKAP1-/- mice, whereas there was no significant
difference in Drp1-S616 phosphorylation in the retina between WT and AKAP1-/- mice (Fig. 4b).
Consistent with this finding, increased Drp1 immunoreactivity was present in RBPMS-positive
RGCs in AKAP1-/- mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 4b).
AKAP1 loss causes mitochondrial fission and mitophagosome formation in RGCs

To determine whether loss of AKAP1 alters mitochondrial fusion activity in the retina and also
triggers mitochondrial fission and loss in RGCs in AKAP1-/- mice, we examined the expression
levels of optic atropy type 1 (OPA1) and mitofusin (Mfn) 1 and 2 in the retina as well as the
alteration of mitochondrial ultrastructure using Western blot and electron microscope (EM)
tomography analyses. We observed a significant decrease of total OPA1 protein expression in
the retina of AKAP1-/- mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 5a). More specifically, small isoform
(80 kDa) of OPA1 protein expression was significantly decreased, whereas there was no
difference in the large isoform (100 kDa) of OPA1 protein expression in the retina of AKAP1-/mice (Fig. 5a). We also observed a significant increase of Mfn1 protein expression, whereas
there was no difference in Mfn2 protein expression in the retina of AKAP1-/- mice (Fig. 5a)
Using EM and EM tomography analyses, we further assessed changes of mitochondrial
ultrastructure by measuring mitochondrial volume density, number, cross-sectional area and
cristae abundance in RGC somas in AKAP1-/- mice. In comparison with WT mice,
representative volumes generated by EM tomography provided evidence for mitochondrial
fission and loss of mitochondrial mass (Fig. 5, b-d). Quantitative analysis showed significant
decreases of mitochondrial volume density (13 ± 0.7%), and mitochondrial cross-sectional area
(0.14 ± 0.02 µm2), but a significant increase of mitochondrial number (0.92 ± 0.06 per µm2) in
RGC somas of AKAP1-/- mice compared with WT (22 ± 2 %, mitochondrial volume density;
0.20 ± 0.01 µm2, mitochondrial cross-sectional area ; 0.67 ± 0.05 per µm2, mitochondrial
number) (Fig. 5c). However, there was no significant difference in mitochondrial cristae
abundance, which is the ratio of cristae membrane surface area divided by the mitochondrial
outer membrane surface area, in RGC somas between WT and AKAP1-/- mice (Fig. 5c). Using
3D reconstruction of tomographic volume, we observed that the mitochondria from AKAP1-/mice are significantly smaller than the WT mitochondria. Smaller mitochondria should have
fewer cristae, given that cristae shape doesn't change a lot, but the density of cristae was about
the same between WT and AKAP1-/- (Fig. 5d). These results suggest that AKAP1 loss induces
an imbalance of mitochondrial dynamics by triggering mitochondrial fission and loss in RGCs.
AKAP1 loss promotes mitochondrial abnormalities and mitophagy in cardiac injury53. Based on
our current findings of mitochondrial fission and loss, we determined whether AKAP1 loss
induces mitophagosome formation using Western blot, immunohistochemistry and EM
tomography analyses. Indeed, AKAP1 loss significantly enhanced LC3-II protein expression,

but decreased p62 protein expression in the retina of AKAP1-/- mice compared with WT mice
(Fig. 6a). Immunohistochemical analysis showed strong LC3 immunoreactivities in RGC somas
and axons in the GCL of AKAP1-/- mice (Fig. 6b). Notably, segmented volumes from threedimensional (3D) tomographic reconstructions using EM tomography revealed examples of
degraded mitochondria with severe cristae depletion that were engulfed in mitophagosomes in
RGC soma of AKAP1-/- mice (Fig. 6c-i).
AKAP1 loss results in OXPHOS dysfunction and induces oxidative stress in the retina
Since AKAP1 deletion increased superoxide production in primary hippocampal and cortical
neurons in response to glutamate excitotoxicity as well as resulted in OXPHOS complex (Cx) II
dysfunction30, we determined whether loss of AKAP1 alters OXPHOS Cxs and induces
oxidative stress in the retina. Using OXPHOS rodent cocktail antibody, we further observed that
AKAP1 loss significantly increases OXPHOS Cx II, but decreased OXPHOS Cx III-V protein
expression in the retina compared with WT mice (Fig. 7a). However, there was no significant
difference in OXPHOS Cx I protein expression in the retina between WT and AKAP1-/- mice
(Fig. 7a). We observed a significant increase of superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) protein
expression in AKAP1-/- mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 7b). Immunohistochemical analysis
using SOD2 antibody demonstrated that SOD2 protein expression was increased in the inner
retina, including RGCs in the GCL, of AKAP1-/- mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 7c). These
results suggest that AKAP1 loss compromises OXPHOS and may contribute to oxidative stress
in the retina.
AKAP1 loss inactivates Akt and activates Bim/Bax pathway in the retina
To determine whether loss of AKAP1 alters Akt phosphorylation at serine 473 (S473), we
examined the expression levels of Akt protein expression and Akt-S473 phosphorylation in
AKAP1-/- mice using Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses. We observed a
significant increase of total Akt protein expression, but decrease of phospho-Akt-S473 protein
expression in AKAP1-/- mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 8a). Following the normalization of
phospho-Akt-S473 by total Akt, we observe that AKAP1 loss induced a significant decrease of
Akt-S473 phosphorylation in the retina of AKAP1-/- mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 8a). In
addition, we observed that Akt immunoreactivity was increased in the INL and GCL of the retina

of AKAP1-/- mice (Fig. 8b). More specifically, increased Akt immunoreactivity was prominent
in Brn3a-positive RGCs of AKAP1-/- mice (Fig. 8b). Because Akt inactivation is associated with
Bim/Bax activation and intrinsic apoptotic cell death54,55, we further determined whether AKAP1
loss activates Bim/Bax in the retina using Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses. We
observed significant increases of Bim and Bax protein expression in AKAP1-/- mice compared
with WT mice, respectively (Fig. 8c). In addition, we observed that Bax immunoreactivity was
increased in the GCL of the retina of AKAP1-/- mice (Fig. 8d). More specifically, increased Bax
immunoreactivity was prominent in RBPMS-positive RGCs of AKAP1-/- mice (Fig. 8d).

Discussion
We here demonstrated for the first time that RGCs showed AKAP1 immunoreactivity in D2Gpnmb+ mice and elevated IOP triggered loss of AKAP1 in glaucomatous RGCs. In addition,
elevated IOP increased CaN and total Drp1 levels in glaucomatous RGCs. It also impaired Drp1
phosphorylation at S637 in glaucomatous retina. These results suggest that AKAP1 and Drp1
phosphorylation at S637 have critical roles in RGC mitochondria and survival against
glaucomatous damage. We also observed that loss of AKAP1 increased CaN and total Drp1
levels in RGCs, and compromised Drp1 phosphorylation at S637 in the retina, leading to
mitochondrial fission and loss, and mitophagosome formation in RGCs. In addition, loss of
AKAP1 resulted in OXPHOS dysfunction, as well as Akt inactivation and Bim/Bax activation;
these effects contribute to glaucomatous neurodegeneration.
Impairment of mitochondrial dynamics is critically involved in glaucomatous RGCs and
their axon degeneration8,11,14,43, and inhibition of Drp1 rescues RGCs and their axons by
preserving mitochondrial integrity in experimental glaucoma14,43. Our previous study
demonstrated that elevated IOP showed a significant increase of total Drp1 level, while it did not
alter phosphorylation of Drp1 at S616 in glaucomatous retina14; these effects suggest that
elevated IOP-mediated mitochondrial fission activity is not dependent on Drp1 phosphorylation
at S616 in glaucomatous RGC degeneration. Hence, our novel finding that glaucomatous RGCs
lacking AKAP1 trigger CaN-mediated dephosphorylation of Drp1 at S637 suggest an important
rationale to further investigate the impact of AKAP1 loss, mitochondrial fragmentation and its
related signaling pathway in RGCs.
AKAP1 is an important regulator of mitochondrial function by PKA anchoring and Drp1
phosphorylation at S637, and overexpression of AKAP1 is neuroprotective in neuronal cells
against the mitochondrial toxin rotenone25,27,29,30,50. Emerging evidence showed that mice
lacking AKAP1 exhibit increased infarct following transient cerebral ischemia as well as
increased Drp1 localization to mitochondria from the forebrain tissues and decreased Drp1
phosphorylation at S63730. Our findings of enhanced CaN-mediated Drp1 phosphorylation at
S637, and extensive mitochondrial fission and loss in the retina of AKAP1-/- mice suggest that
AKAP1 loss directly contribute to Drp1 phosphorylation-dependent mitochondrial fragmentation
and loss in glaucomatous RGCs. This notion is also supported by the evidence of increasing
LC3-II and decreasing p62 levels, as well as mitophagosome formation that contains degrading

mitochondria in RGC somas of AKAP1-/- mice. In addition, it is supported by the evidence of
our previous report showing autophagosome/mitophagosome formation in RGC axons of
glaucomatous DBA/2J mice 14. Previous study indicated the notion that AKAP1 regulates
mitochondrial dynamics by posttranslational modifications, but levels of Drp1, OPA1 and Mfn2
were unaltered in total forebrain homogenates from AKAP1-/- mice30. Of interest, however, we
observed a decrease of total OPA1, but an increase of total Drp1 and Mfn1 in the retina of
AKAP1-/- mice. Inner membrane-anchored long OPA1 (L-OPA1) undergoes proteolytic
cleavage resulting in short OPA1 (S-OPA1)56. Cells contain a mixture of L-OPA1, required for
mitochondrial fusion and S-OPA, which facilitate mitochondrial fission under normal conditions.
Disruption of this balance in times of stress, result in mitochondrial fragmentation56. Thus, these
unexpected, but important results propose the possibility that AKAP1 may contribute to the
regulation of mitochondrial dynamics not only by posttranslational modifications, but also by
alteration of fusion/fission protein expression in the retina. Future studies will be needed to
clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying the alteration of fusion/fission proteins in the retina
lacking AKAP1.
Emerging evidence showed that AKAP1 deletion results in OXPHOS Cx II dysfunction
in neuronal cells30. OXPHOS Cx II is a source of the mitochondrial reserve respiratory capacity
that is regulated by metabolic sensor and promotes cell survival against hypoxia. In the present
study, the observation that increasing OXPHOS Cx II, but decreasing OXPHOS Cxs III-V
activities triggered by loss of AKAP1 in the retina is likely to imply that AKAP1 plays a critical
role in OXPHOS function in RGCs. Moreover, increasing OXPHOS Cx II activity may be an
important endogenous compensatory defense mechanism in response to oxidative stress.
Further, this imbalance of OXPHOS Cxs suggests another possibility that AKAP1 loss may
contribute to an increase of ROS production and decrease of ATP production in the retina that
are previously reported in pressure and/or oxidative stress-induced RGC degeneration14. In
particular, association of POAG with polymorphism of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase
subunit 1 of OXPHOS Cx IV suggests a potential role of abnormal OXPHOS-mediated
mitochondrial dysfunction in glaucoma pathogenesis3,4. Therefore, these results collectively
suggest that AKAP1 loss in glaucomatous retina contributes to OXPHOS dysfunction that is
associated with metabolic and oxidative stress by increasing ROS production and decreasing
ATP reduction, leading to RGC death during glaucomatous neurodegeneration.

Loss of AKAP1 inactivates Akt signaling and increases apoptosis in cardiac
dysfunction57,58. Akt pathway controls the expression of apoptosis-related gene through
transcription factors such as FoxO (FoxO1 and FoxO3a)59,60 and Akt activation promotes cell
survival by inhibiting FoxO3a/Bim/Bax pathway55,59,60. The pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 homology
domain 3-only protein Bim induces apoptosis, primarily through its increased binding activity
toward multiple pro-survival Bcl-2-like proteins, whose dissociations activate Bak and Bax61,62.
In addition, Bax-mediated mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization is an important
pathophysiological mechanism for metabolic dysfunction and cell death63,64, and Bax activation
plays a critical role in mitochondrial dysfunction-mediated RGC degeneration14,17. Because
Drp1 contributes to Bax oligomerization, mitochondrial fission and the cellular apoptotic
pathway65-67, increased total Drp1 and Bax levels in AKAP1-/- retinas suggest that AKAP1 loss
may contribute to Drp1-mediated Bax oligomerization, leading to mitochondrial fission. Recent
evidence from our group and others indicated that activation of cAMP/PKA pathway promotes
RGC survival 55,68-70 and that AKAP1-mediated neuroprotection requires PKA anchoring and
Drp1 phosphorylation at S63727,29,30,50,71. In this regard, our observation that AKAP1-/- retinas
dephosphorylates Akt at S473 and activates Bim/Bax pathway raise the possibility that AKAP1
may be critical to RGC protection by modulating Akt/Bim/Bax pathway against glaucomatous
damage. Future studies will be necessary to examine whether overexpression of AKAP1 rescues
RGCs by promoting Drp1 phosphorylation at S637, maintaining metabolic activity, activating
Akt pathway and inhibiting Bim/Bax pathway.
In summary, our results represent the first direct evidence of a Drp1 phosphorylationmediated mitochondrial pathogenic mechanism that leads to mitochondrial fragmentation and
metabolic dysfunction in glaucomatous RGC degeneration. Also, we provide evidence for the
first time that AKAP1 loss-mediated CaN activation and Drp1 dephosphorylation at S637 result
in mitochondrial fragmentation, mitophagosome formation, OXPHOS dysfunction and oxidative
stress, as well as Akt inactivation and Bim/Bax activation in RGCs. Therefore, we propose
overexpression of AKAP1 and modulation of Drp1 phosphorylation at S637 as therapeutic
strategies for neuroprotective intervention in glaucoma and other mitochondria-related optic
neuropathies.

Materials and methods
Animals
Adult female DBA/2J and D2-Gpnmb+ mice (The Jackson Laboratory), and adult male WT and
AKPA1-/- mice were housed in covered cages, fed with a standard rodent diet ad libitum, and
kept on a12 h light/12 h dark cycle. The following PCR primers were used to determine AKAP1
genotype: GGAGGCGATCACAGCAACAACCG (R),
ATACAGAAGCAGATCACTCAGGAGG (F-WT), CAGTCCCAAGGCTCATTTCAGGCC
(F-KO)30. All procedures concerning animals were in accordance with the Association for
Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic Vision
Research and under protocols approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the
University of California, San Diego.
Tissue preparation
Mice were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of a cocktail of ketamine (100 mg/kg,
Ketaset; Fort Dodge Animal Health) and xylazine (9 mg/kg, TranquiVed; VEDCO Inc.) prior to
cervical dislocation. For immunohistochemistry, the retinas and ONHs were dissected from the
choroids and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) in phosphate buffered saline
(PBS, pH 7.4) for 2 h at 4 °C. Retinas were washed several times with PBS then dehydrated
through graded levels of ethanol and embedded in polyester wax. For Western analyses,
extracted retinas were immediately used.
Western blot analyses
Harvested retinas (n = 4 retinas/group) were homogenized for 1 min on ice with a modified
RIPA lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM DTT, 0.5%
sodium deoxycholate and 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.6), containing complete protease inhibitors. The
lysates were then centrifuged at 15,000 g for 15 min and protein amounts in the supernatants
were measured by Bradford assay. Proteins (10-20 µg) were separated by SDS/PAGE and
electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PVDF) membranes (GE Healthcare
Bio-Science). The membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk and PBS/0.1% Tween-20
(PBS-T) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with primary antibodies for overnight at 4 °C.
Primary antibodies are mouse monoclonal anti-Actin antibody (1:20,000; Millipore), rabbit

and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence substrate system. The images were captured
and quantified by using ImageQuant™ LAS 4000 system (GE Healthcare Bio-Science) and band
densities were normalized to that of actin, total Drp1 or total Akt.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical staining of 7 µm wax sections of full thickness retina were performed.

antibodies, Alexa Fluor 488 or 568 dye-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:100, Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA), Alexa Fluor 488 or 568 dye-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:100, Invitrogen)
and Alexa Fluor 568 dye-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (1:100, Invitrogen) for 4 h at 4°C and
subsequently washed with PBS. The sections were counterstained with the nucleic acid stain
Hoechst 33342 (1 µg/mL; Invitrogen) in PBS. Images were acquired with confocal microscopy
(Olympus FluoView1000; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
RT-PCR and quantitative real-time RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from retinas using the Absolutely RNA Miniprep Kit (Stratagene),
according to the manufacturer’s protocol as previously described55. cDNAs were synthesized
from total RNAs with iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s
protocols. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR was performed with cDNAs synthesized from
150 µg of the total RNA of each group as a template and specific primers for AKAP1:
CTGCCAGTCAGTACTCAGCC (F), CTTTGGCACCTCGATCTCCC (R). For the
quantification of the relative mRNA expressions of each group, real-time PCR was carried out
using MX3000P real-time PCR system (Stratagene) as follows. cDNAs were amplified using
SSO Adv. Universal SYBR Green SuperMix (Bio-Rad) and the specific primers for 40 cycles
(95 °C for 5 min, and 40 cycles (95 °C for 30 sec, 60 °C for 30 sec, and 72 °C for 30 sec)).
Output data were obtained as Ct values and the differential mRNA expression of AKAP1 among
groups was calculated using the comparative Ct method. GAPDH mRNA, an internal control,
was amplified along with the target gene, and the Ct value of GAPDH was used to normalize the
expression of the target gene.
Transmission electron microscopy
For conventional EM, two eyes from each group (n = 2 mice) were fixed via cardiac perfusion
with 2% paraformaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde (Ted Pella, Redding, CA) in 0.15M sodium
cacodylate (pH 7.4, Sigma) solution at 37°C and placed in pre-cooled fixative of the same
composition on ice for 1 h. The following procedure was used to optimize mitochondrial
structural preservation and membrane contrast72. The retinas were dissected in a solution of
0.15M sodium cacodylate plus 3mM calcium chloride (pH 7.4) on ice and then post-fixed with a
1% osmium tetroxide, 0.8% potassium ferrocyanide, 3mM calcium chloride in 0.1M sodium

cacodylate solution (pH 7.4) for 1 h, washed with ice-cold distilled water, poststained with 2%
uranyl acetate solution at 4°C, dehydrated using graded ethanols, and embedded in Durcupan
resin (Fluka). A similar procedure was used for cultured primary RGCs from each group.
Ultrathin (70 nm) sections were post-stained with uranyl acetate and lead salt solutions and
evaluated using a JEOL 1200FX transmission EM operated at 80kV. Images were recorded on
film at 8,000X magnification. The negatives were digitized at 1800 dpi using a Nikon Cool scan
system, giving an image size of 4033 x 6010 pixel array and a pixel resolution of 1.77 nm72. For
quantitative analysis, the number of mitochondria was normalized to the total area occupied by
axons in each image, which was measured using ImageJ (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/).
Mitochondrial lengths were measured with ImageJ. The mitochondrial volume density, defined
as the volume occupied by mitochondria divided by the volume occupied by the axoplasm, was
estimated using stereology as follows. A 112 x 112 square grid (112 x 112 chosen for ease of use
with Photoshop) was overlaid on each image loaded in Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc., San
Jose, CA), and mitochondria and axoplasm lying under intercepts were counted. The relative
volume of mitochondria was expressed as the ratio of intercepts coinciding with this organelle
relative to the intercepts coinciding with axoplasm.
Electron microscope tomography
Sections of retina tissues from each group were cut at a thickness of 400 nm. For each
reconstruction, a double-tilt series of images at one degree tilt increment was collected with an
FEI titan hibase electron microscope operated at 300 kV. Images were recorded with a Gatan
4Kx4K CCD camera. The magnification was 11,000x and the pixel resolution was 0.81 nm.
The IMOD package was used for alignment, reconstruction and volume segmentation. Volume
segmentation was performed by manual tracing of membranes in the planes of highest resolution
with the Drawing Tools and Interpolator plug-ins73. The mitochondrial reconstructions and
surface-rendered volumes were visualized using 3DMOD. Measurements of mitochondrial outer,
inner boundary, and cristae membrane surface areas and volumes were made within segmented
volumes using IMODinfo. These were used to determine the cristae abundance, defined as the
ratio: sum of the cristae membrane surface areas divided by the mitochondrial outer membrane
surface area. Movies of the tomographic volume were made using IMODmovie.

Fig. 5 Mitochondrial fission in AKAP1-/- RGC somas. (a) Western blot analyses for total
OPA1 (L-OPA1 & S-OPA1), and Mfn1 and 2 in the retinas of AKAP1-/- and WT mice. (b-d)
EM and EM tomography analyses for mitochondrial fission and loss in AKAP1-/- RGC somas.
(b) 1.6-nm thick slices through the middle of tomographic volumes of WT RGC somas show an
abundance of larger mitochondria. In contrast, the mitochondria are smaller with a greater
number in AKAP1-/- RGC somas, but show no alteration of cristae architecture. (c) Quantitative
analyses of mitochondrial volume density, number and cross-sectional area and cristae
abundance in WT and AKAP1-/- RGC somas. Note that AKAP1-/- RGC somas show significant
loss of mitochondrial mass and cross-sectional area, and a significant increase in mitochondrial
number. However, there was no significant difference in cristae abundance of AKAP1-/- RGC
somas. (d) Top view of the surface-rendered volume showing 3 adjacent mitochondria from a
WT tomographic volume (left) and an AKAP1-/- volume (right). Comparing the side view with
the top view provides perspective on the distribution of the predominantly tubular cristae (in an
assortment of colors) and reveals substantial heterogeneity of cristae size. The mitochondrial
outer membranes were made translucent to better visualize the cristae. The number of cristae in
each mitochondrion is indicated. Mean ± SD (a) and Mean ± SEM (c); n = 3 (a), n = 11
(mitochondrial volume, number and cristae abundance for WT and AKAP1-/-, c) and n = 22 or 39
(mitochondrial size for WT or AKAP1-/-, c); *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01 (two-tailed Student’s ttest). Scale bars: 200 nm.

membrane (saddlebrown trace). Only two relatively small pieces of the IBM remain. The left
hand fragment at no point is connected to the right hand fragment in the volume. (e) Side view
of the mitophagosome. (f) Side view with the mitophagosome membrane made transparent to
see the engulfed mitochondrion. (g) Side view with the outer mitochondrial membrane made
transparent to see the 2 fragments of the IBM and the one crista that remain. (h) Top view
showing the crista and right-hand portion of the IBM inside the mitochondrion, which is inside
the mitophagosome. (i) An oblique view with the mitophagosome and outer mitochondrial
membranes made transparent to see the crista and two IBM fragments. Note that mitochondria
in the AKAP1-/- RGC soma demonstrate autophagosome/mitophagosome formation.
