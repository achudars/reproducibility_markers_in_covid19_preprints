Abstract
During mitosis, the formation of microtubule-kinetochore attachments is
monitored by the serine/threonine kinase Mono-Polar Spindle 1 (MPS1).
MPS1 is recruited to unattached kinetochores where it phosphorylates KNL1,
BUB1 and MAD1 to initiate the spindle checkpoint. This arrests the cell cycle
until all kinetochores have been stably captured by microtubules. MPS1 also
contributes to the error correction process rectifying incorrect kinetochore
attachments. MPS1 activity at kinetochores requires auto-phosphorylation at
multiple sites including T676 in the activation segment or “T-loop”. We now
demonstrate that a BUBR1-bound pool of PP2A-B56 regulates MPS1 T-loop
autophosphorylation and hence activation status in mammalian cells.
Overriding this regulation using phospho-mimetic mutations in the MPS1 Tloop to generate a constitutively active kinase results in a prolonged mitotic
arrest with continuous turn-over of microtubule-kinetochore attachments.
Dynamic regulation of MPS1 catalytic activity by kinetochore-localized PP2AB56 is thus critical for controlled MPS1 activity and timely cell cycle
progression.

Introduction
Unattached kinetochores are detected by the spindle assembly checkpoint
(SAC) (Musacchio, 2015). During mitosis, generation of a checkpoint
response, and recruitment of all other SAC proteins to kinetochores depends
on the activity of a conserved protein kinase, MPS1 (Ciliberto and Hauf, 2017;
Liu and Winey, 2012; Musacchio, 2015; Pachis and Kops, 2018). MPS1 is
phosphorylated by CDK1-CCNB1 at S281 and then localises to kinetochores
as soon as the nuclear envelope breaks down and is lost from kinetochores
as they attach (Hayward et al., 2019; Jelluma et al., 2010; Stucke et al.,
2002). MPS1 binds to kinetochores via multiple weak interactions with the
HEC1/NDC80 complex in a manner competitive with microtubule binding
(Hiruma et al., 2015; Ji et al., 2015). This supports a simple model explaining
the restriction of MPS1 activity to mitosis by the requirement for CDK1CCNB1 and how MPS1-dependent checkpoint signaling is coupled to
microtubule binding.
MPS1 activation at kinetochores requires autophosphorylation of the Tloop on threonine 676 (T676) (Jelluma et al., 2008a; Kang et al., 2007;
Mattison et al., 2007). Like other kinases, MPS1 is thought to trans autophosphorylate and thus self-activate, an event that would be promoted by
clustering of several MPS1 molecules at an unattached kinetochore (Combes
et al., 2018; Dodson et al., 2013; Kang et al., 2007). Kinetochore localisation
and activity of MPS1 are therefore linked. Inhibition of MPS1 activity by small
molecule inhibitors or mutations in the MPS1 active site result in increased
rather than decreased levels of MPS1 at kinetochores (Hewitt et al., 2010;
Jelluma et al., 2010; Santaguida et al., 2010). This is not simply explained.

However, autophosphorylation of the N-terminus of MPS1, in addition to
relieving autoinhibition of kinase activity, has been suggested to promote
release from the kinetochore, possibly by interfering with Hec1 binding
(Combes et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2014).
Since initiation of the spindle assembly checkpoint requires multi-site
phosphorylation of KNL1, MAD1 and BUB1 by MPS1 as well as MPS1
phosphorylation by multiple kinases, termination of the checkpoint response
must require phosphatases. Both PP2A-B56 and PP1 have been implicated in
the process of dephosphorylating KNL1 and promoting spindle assembly
checkpoint silencing (Espert et al., 2014; Nijenhuis et al., 2014). However, the
phosphatases acting on MPS1 and other checkpoint proteins still need to be
clarified. PP1 has been implicated in dephosphorylating the MPS1 T-loop in
flies (Moura et al., 2017), although it is not clear whether this mechanism is
conserved in mammals. PP2A-B56 exists in several spatially distinct
populations in mitotic cells (Qian et al., 2013; Vallardi et al., 2019). One pool
is bound to the C-terminal domain of the BUBR1 protein via a conserved
LxxIxE motif (Kruse et al., 2013; Suijkerbuijk et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2013). This
pool of PP2A-B56 has been shown to oppose both the Aurora B and the
MPS1 kinases in chromosome alignment and spindle checkpoint signaling,
respectively. Depletion of PP2A-B56 therefore results in mitotically arrested
cells with unattached kinetochores (Espert et al., 2014; Foley et al., 2011;
Maciejowski et al., 2017). In addition to orchestrating spindle checkpoint
signaling, MPS1 also contributes directly to the turnover of erroneous
microtubule-kinetochore attachments by phosphorylating the Ska complex at

microtubule-kinetochore junctions. Again, this activity of MPS1 is opposed by
PP2A-B56 (Maciejowski et al., 2017).
Here we demonstrate that a BUBR1-dependent pool of PP2A-B56 is a
key MPS1 T-loop phosphatase. Furthermore, we investigate the role of
dynamic turnover of MPS1 T-loop phosphorylation by PP2A-B56 in
checkpoint signaling and error correction.

Results and Discussion
MPS1 T-loop phosphorylation is controlled by PP2A
MPS1 activity is dynamically regulated by autophosphorylation at Threonine
676 (T676) in the T-loop of the kinase domain (Jelluma et al., 2008a; Kang et
al., 2007; Mattison et al., 2007). To identify the class of phosphatase acting at
this site, mitotic HeLa cells expressing endogenously tagged MPS1-GFP were
pre-treated with PPP family phosphatase inhibitors, then briefly incubated with
MPS1 inhibitor (MPS1i) to stop T-loop autophosphorylation (Choy et al., 2017;
Hewitt et al., 2010; Ishihara et al., 1989; Mitsuhashi et al., 2001). In control
cells, MPS1i addition resulted in the loss of the MPS1 pT676 signal (Figure
1A and 1B, Figure S1A and S1B). The signal for total MPS1-GFP increased,
in line with reports by other groups (Hewitt et al., 2010; Jelluma et al., 2010).
Addition of the dual PP1/2A inhibitor (PP1/2Ai; calyculin) but not PP1 inhibitor
(PP1i; tautomycetin), prevented the loss of the T-loop phosphorylation (Figure
1A and 1B). Neither treatment affected the increase of MPS1-GFP levels at
kinetochores upon MPS1 inhibition (Figure 1A and 1C). These observations
suggest that in mammalian cells, in contrast to Drosophila, a PPP-family
phosphatase other than PP1 was involved in the turnover of the MPS1 T-loop
phosphorylation.
To identify the PPP family phosphatase responsible for the turnover of
the pT676 site, GFP-MPS1 cells were depleted of individual PPP family
catalytic subunits using siRNA (Espert et al., 2014). Depletion of the PP2A
catalytic a subunit, the predominant PP2A catalytic subunit in HeLa cells
(Janssens and Goris, 2001), resulted in a significant retention of the pT676
signal following MPS1 inhibition, whereas none of the other depletions,

including PP1a, b and g co-depletions, had the same effect (Figure S1C-S1F).
This result was independent of whether cells had been arrested in mitosis or
were passing through an unperturbed cell cycle (Figure 2SA and 2SB). These
data confirm the results of the phosphatase inhibitor treatments (Figure 1A1C) and suggest that a PP2A phosphatase holoenzyme complex is
responsible for modulating the MPS1-T676 phosphorylation.

BUBR1-bound PP2A-B56 regulates MPS1 T676 phosphorylation
Since the BUBR1-associated pool of the PP2A-B56 phosphatase had already
been identified as the phosphatase acting on some MPS1
autophosphorylations and on MPS1 substrates at the kinetochore (Espert et
al., 2014; Maciejowski et al., 2017; Qian et al., 2017), this was the most likely
candidate for the MPS1 T676 phosphatase. Indeed, depletion of all B56
subunits resulted in retention of the pT676 staining upon MPS1 inhibition
whereas depletion of all B55 subunits had no effect (Figure 1D and 1E, Figure
S1H). The increase in kinetochore-bound MPS1 was not altered by depletion
of either PP2A phosphatase (Figure 1D and 1F). To define the required pool
of PP2A-B56, BUBR1 was replaced with a mutant carrying two mutations in
the PP2A-B56 binding site (BUBR1L669A/I672A) (Espert et al., 2014; Kruse et al.,
2013). In cells expressing GFP-BUBR1L669A/I672A, but not wild type BUBR1,
MPS1 T-loop phosphorylation was retained upon MPS1i treatment (Figure
1G-1I and Figure S1I). Together, these data show that during mitosis the
MPS1 T-loop phosphorylation is dynamically controlled by the BUBR1-bound
pool of PP2A-B56 (Figure 1J).

PP2A-B56 modulates MPS1 kinetochore localization by counteracting
both MPS1 and Aurora B
MPS1 localization to unattached kinetochores is promoted by the CDK1CCNB1 and Aurora B kinases and is opposed by its own activity (Hayward et
al., 2019; Hewitt et al., 2010; Jelluma et al., 2010; Nijenhuis et al., 2013;
Saurin et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2013). It has been suggested that release of
active MPS1 from kinetochores is mediated by auto-phosphorylation of the
MPS1 N-terminus (Wang et al., 2014). We tested whether the phosphorylation
status of T33 and S37 in the N-terminus of MPS1 was also regulated by
PP2A-B56. In agreement with a published report, depletion of PP2A-B56
stabilized pT33/pS37 in the absence of MPS1 activity (Figure 2A-2F)
(Maciejowski et al., 2017). Surprisingly, this did not result in decreased total
MPS1-GFP at kinetochores (Figure 2D-2F). Aurora B is a major positive
regulator of MPS1 localization to kinetochores (Nijenhuis et al., 2013; Saurin
et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2013), suggesting that PP2A-B56 may be
simultaneously counteracting the MPS1 N-terminal autophosphorylations
promoting MPS1 kinetochore release and the Aurora B-dependent
kinetochore phosphorylations promoting MPS1 kinetochore accumulation.
Analysis of MPS1-GFP localization in cells briefly treated with Aurora B
inhibitor (+AURKBi) confirmed that MPS1-GFP was lost from kinetochores
upon Aurora B inhibition. This loss was not observed in cells that had been
depleted of the PP2A catalytic a subunit or all PP2A-B56 regulatory subunits
(Figure 2G and 2H). PP2A-B56 therefore counteracts the MPS1 kinetochore
recruitment mediated by Aurora B. This effect appears to be dominant over
the self-ejection triggered by the N-terminal phosphorylation of MPS1,

explaining why total MPS1-GFP kinetochore accumulation is not reversed by
depletion of PP2A-B56.

MPS1-T675D/T676D is an active MPS1 kinase
To study the importance of MPS1 T-loop dephosphorylation by PP2A-B56 in
isolation of the effect of PP2A-B56 on other substrates, we generated MPS1
mutants in which both the canonical T-loop residue T676 as well as the
adjacent threonine T675 were mutated to phospho-mimetic aspartate
(MPS1DD) or non-phosphorylatable alanine (MPS1AA). GFP-MPS1AA and
GFP-MPS1DD mutant proteins were then analyzed for their ability to initiate
and sustain spindle assembly checkpoint signaling alongside wild type (GFPMPS1WT) and kinase-dead (GFP-MPS1KD) MPS1.
When endogenous MPS1 was replaced with the different forms of
GFP-MPS1, GFP-MPS1KD and GFP-MPS1AA showed increased kinetochore
levels in comparison to the wild type protein (Figure 3A and 3B, Figure 3G).
This behavior of GFP-MPS1KD and GFP-MPS1AA is indicative of reduced or
absent kinase activity (Hewitt et al., 2010; Jelluma et al., 2010). In contrast,
GFP-MPS1DD exhibited decreased levels of kinetochore recruitment (Figure
3A and 3B, Figure 3G). This observation is consistent with the idea that a
constitutively active form of MPS1 should induce its own ejection from the
kinetochore more effectively than the wild type protein (Wang et al., 2014).
Only induction of GFP-MPS1WT or GFP-MPS1DD resulted in the effective
recruitment of BUBR1 to the kinetochore and supported a cell cycle arrest in
response to nocodazole (Figure 3A. 3C and 3D). All of these data taken
together suggest that GFP-MPS1DD represents an active form of MPS1.

Consistent with this proposal, purified FLAG-MPS1WT and FLAGMPS1DD both exhibited a significant phosphorylation induced band upshift in
Western blots which was not observed with kinase activity deficient FLAGMPS1KD and FLAG-MPS1AA (Figure 3E). FLAG-MPS1DD was less strongly
upshifted than FLAG-MPS1WT, indicating that MPS1DD has reduced kinase
activity in comparison to wild type MPS1 (Figure 3E). Measurement of the
autophosphorylation capacity of FLAG-MPS1DD in comparison to FLAGMPS1WT in radioactive kinase assays indicated that FLAG-MPS1DD possessed
42.60 ± 7.57 % of the kinase activity of wild type MPS1, in contrast to 0.72 ±
0.02 % for FLAG-MPS1KD and 16.92 ± 6.01 % for FLAG-MPS1AA. FLAGMPS1DD phosphorylated a KNL1 fragment in vitro to near wild type levels
(Figure 3F), and in all functional assays MPS1DD kinase activity appeared to
be sufficient to confer wild type levels of spindle assembly checkpoint
proficiency (Figure 3A-3D, Figure 3G).

Unregulated MPS1 activity traps cells in mitosis
To test the consequences of unregulated MPS1 activity for mitotic
progression, HeLa-Flp-In/TREx cells depleted of endogenous MPS1 and
expressing the different versions of GFP-MPS1 were filmed progressing
through mitosis (Figure 4A and 4B). Replacement of endogenous MPS1 with
GFP-MPS1WT re-instated normal chromosome segregation and mitotic timing
(Figure 4A, top panel; Figure 4C-4E). Expression of either GFP-MPS1KD or
GFP-MPS1AA resulted in onset of chromosome segregation before completion
of chromosome alignment and significantly shortened mitotic duration,
consistent with a previous report (Jelluma et al., 2008a). These effects were

more pronounced for GFP-MPS1KD than for GFP-MPS1AA, in line with the idea
that an MPS1-T-loop alanine mutation allows some residual kinase activity to
take place (Figure 4A, second and third panel from top; Figure 4C-4E).
Interestingly, cells expressing only the GFP-MPS1DD version of MPS1 showed
a phenotype distinct from both wild type as well as kinase dead and T-loop
deficient MPS1. These cells entered mitosis normally but failed to align all
their chromosomes and typically never reached a compact metaphase plate.
The bulk of the chromosomes accumulated around a broad pseudometaphase with chromosomes continuously leaving this arrangement. Most of
the cells remained trapped in this pseudo-metaphase state for several hours
and eventually carried out an abnormal anaphase or apoptosed (Figure 4A,
bottom panel, Figure 4C-4E).

Constitutively active MPS1 results in impaired microtubule-kinetochore
attachment formation
In addition to its key role in orchestrating the spindle assembly checkpoint,
MPS1 has been reported to be an important modulator of microtubulekinetochore attachments (Jelluma et al., 2008b; Maciejowski et al., 2017;
Santaguida et al., 2010). To understand the causes of the metaphase delay
in cells with constitutively active MPS1, Hela-Flp-In/TREx cells depleted of
endogenous MPS1 and expressing GFP-MPS1WT or GFP-MPS1DD were
arrested in mitosis by MG132 treatment, and the alignment status of the
chromosomes and checkpoint status of the kinetochores was evaluated. GFPMPS1DD cells exhibited significantly more unaligned chromosomes than GFPMPS1WT cells (Figure 5A and 5B) suggesting that microtubule-kinetochore

attachments were compromised. Interestingly, only unattached kinetochores
were decorated by GFP-MPS1DD or MAD1 (Figure 5C), showing the behavior
of the spindle checkpoint was not altered by the expression of the
constitutively active form of MPS1 per se. To analyze chromosome alignment
dynamics and error correction proficiency in more detail, a Monastrol washout assay was employed (Jelluma et al., 2008b). This analysis showed that
unregulatable GFP-MPS1DD, like kinase inhibited MPS1, was defective in
chromosome alignment upon Monastrol wash-out, with DD and AA and
WT+MPS1i exhibiting significantly fewer aligned metaphase plates than WT
(P < 0.05 (DD, AA), P < 0.005 (MPS1i) (Student’s t test)), and DD exhibiting
significantly fewer aligned metaphase plates than AA (P < 0.05 (Student’s t
test)) (Figure 5D-5F). The severity of the phenotype was more pronounced in
the complete absence of MPS1 activity than in the unregulatable GFPMPS1DD mutant, possibly due to the different biological causes underlying the
phenotype: in cells treated with MPS1 inhibitor, the main cause of
chromosome alignment defects is the absence of MPS1-dependent PP2AB56 recruitment to the kinetochore. Since this pool of PP2A-B56 opposes the
error correction activities of both MPS1 and Aurora B, this results in
unrestrained error correction. In contrast, cells expressing GFP-MPS1DD, are
proficient in PP2A-B56 recruitment. However, because of the unchecked
GFP-MPS1DD kinase activity the phosphorylation-dephosphorylation balance
of MPS1 targets in the error correction process is shifted towards
phosphorylation and thus destabilization of attachments. Aurora B targets,
however, are controlled normally in this situation.

To demonstrate that the attachments that are formed in cells
expressing GFP-MPS1DD are less well stabilized than in control cells, the
interkinetochore distances at aligned and unaligned chromosomes were
measured in GFP-MPS1WT and GFP-MPS1DD cells. Indeed, the KNL1-KNL1
distance at aligned kinetochores in GFP-MPS1DD cells was significantly
smaller than (0.233 µm, p < 0.0005 (Student’s t test)) than in control cells,
consistent with a reduction in pulling forces due to decreased microtubulekinetochore attachment stability (Figure 5G).
To further test the idea that cells expressing GFP-MPS1DD excessively
turn over microtubule-kinetochore attachments, GFP-MPS1DD and GFPMPS1WT cells were cold treated to selectively destabilize microtubules not
attached to kinetochores. GFP-MPS1DD cells exhibited significantly fewer
aligned metaphase plates (P < 0.05 (Student’s t test)) and fewer cold-stable
microtubules (P < 0.005 (Student’s t test)), confirming an impaired ability to
stabilize microtubule-kinetochore attachments (Figure 5H). Taken together,
the phenotype of the GFP-MPS1DD expressing cells therefore seems to be
primarily a consequence of uncontrolled MPS1-mediated error correction
activity rather than unrestrained spindle assembly checkpoint activity (Jelluma
et al., 2008b; Maciejowski et al., 2017).
MPS1 has two functions in the regulation of mitosis: it is the key
regulator of the mitotic checkpoint, and at the same time it is also actively
involved in error correction, a task which it shares with the Aurora B kinase
(Pachis and Kops, 2018; Santaguida et al., 2010). We find here that
unregulated kinase activity of MPS1 has a greater effect on error correction
than on spindle assembly checkpoint control. One in-built safe-guarding

mechanism that mitigates the consequences of hyperactive MPS1 is the fact
that MPS1 activity is negatively correlated with its residence time at the
kinetochore (Hewitt et al., 2010; Jelluma et al., 2010). A hyperactive MPS1
would therefore automatically be located less well to unattached kinetochores,
the critical place for the initiation of spindle checkpoint signaling. Consistent
with this idea we find that the phospho-mimetic GFP-MPS1DD mutant shows
significantly reduced kinetochore levels in comparison to wild type MPS1. The
reduced MPS1 kinetochore residence time does not seem to affect spindle
checkpoint signaling qualitatively, as cells expressing only GFP-MPS1DD do
not have any defects in initializing or maintaining a spindle checkpoint signal
(Figure 3A-3D). This may suggest that unregulated MPS1 spindle checkpoint
signaling for shorter time may amount to the same functional outcome as the
wild type situation. However, interestingly, GFP-MPS1DD cells do show signs
of exaggerated error correction, apparent as the inability to align all
chromosomes to a metaphase plate, reduced interkinetochore distances of
aligned chromosomes and diminished numbers of cold-stable K-fibres (Figure
5). These observations are in line with the notion that MPS1 phosphorylates
outer kinetochore targets, including the Ska complex to destabilize erroneous
attachments (Maciejowski et al., 2017). One interesting idea is that, in
contrast to the spindle checkpoint initiating phosphorylation of KNL1, these
phosphorylation events may not be entirely dependent on the kinetochore
localization of MPS1 and could be catalyzed by a cytoplasmic pool of MPS1.
This would explain why for the regulation of kinetochore-microtubule
attachments the unregulated nature of GFP-MPS1DD is not offset by the
shorter kinetochore residence time.

PP2A-B56 has been shown to counteract the microtubule-kinetochore
attachment destabilizing activities of MPS1 as well as Aurora B (Foley et al.,
2011; Kruse et al., 2013; Maciejowski et al., 2017; Suijkerbuijk et al., 2012; Xu
et al., 2013). Using the same phosphatase to oppose both kinases thus allows
coordinated stabilization of microtubule-kinetochore attachments. Our data
indicate that PP2A-B56 not only dephosphorylates important targets of MPS1
in the error correction pathway but also regulates key regulatory residues on
MPS1 itself. Intriguingly, in Drosophila, this latter function of
dephosphorylating the MPS1 T-loop is carried out by PP1, not PP2A-B56, and
seems to mainly affect MPS1’s role in controlling the spindle assembly
checkpoint and not error correction, as Drosophila cells depleted of PP1 did
not show any signs of elevated error correction (Moura et al., 2017). The
reason for this difference to human cells may be found in the distinct wiring of
some aspects of the spindle assembly checkpoint in flies in comparison to
human cells. Most relevant for this discussion, it is not clear whether
Drosophila has a distinct kinetochore pool of PP2A-B56. Certain
functionalities of PP2A-B56 may therefore have been transferred to PP1 in
flies. In human cells, PP2A-B56 emerges as the principal phosphatase
opposing MPS1 phosphorylation events throughout mitosis, and our data
further highlight the importance of this regulation.

ThermoFisher Scientific [FG4R], MA1-91878), GFP (Rabbit pAb; Abcam,
ab290). Human CREST serum was obtained from Antibodies Inc (15-2340001). Antibodies against MPS1 were raised in sheep (Scottish Blood
Transfusion Services) against recombinant His-tagged MPS1 (amino acids 1260) and affinity purified against the same recombinant protein. Antibodies to
MPS1 phosphorylated at T676 were raised in sheep (Scottish Blood
Transfusion Services) and affinity purified using the peptide sequence
CMQPDTpTSVVKDS. Generation of anti-KNL1pT875 has been described
previously (Espert et al., 2014). Secondary donkey antibodies against mouse,
rabbit, guinea pig or sheep and labelled with Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor
555, Alexa Fluor 647, Cy5, or HRP were purchased from Molecular Probes
and Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., respectively. Affinity
purified primary and HRP-coupled secondary antibodies were used at 1µg/ml
final concentration. For western blotting, proteins were separated by SDSPAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose using a Trans-blot Turbo system (BioRad). Protein concentrations were measured by Bradford assay using Protein
Assay Dye Reagent Concentrate (Bio-Rad). All western blots were revealed
using ECL (GE Healthcare).
Molecular biology
Human MPS1 was amplified from human testis cDNA (Marathon cDNA;
Takara Bio Inc.) using Pfu polymerase (Agilent Technologies). MPS1
expression constructs were made using pcDNA5/FRT/TO vectors (Invitrogen)
modified to encode the EGFP or FLAG reading frames. Mutagenesis was
performed using the QuikChange method (Agilent Technologies). DNA
primers were obtained from Invitrogen. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)

duplexes targeting PPP family phosphatase subunits, BUBR1 and MPS1
have been described before (Espert et al., 2014; Hayward et al., 2019; Zeng
et al., 2010). On-target SMARTPools were obtained from Dharmacon
Horizon.
Cell culture procedures
HeLa cells and HEK293T were cultured in DMEM with 1% [vol/vol] GlutaMAX
(Life Technologies) containing 10% [vol/vol] bovine calf serum at 37°C and
5% CO2. For plasmid transfection and siRNA transfection, Mirus LT1 (Mirus
Bio LLC) and Oligofectamine (Invitrogen), respectively, were used. HeLa cell
lines with single integrated copies of the desired transgene were created
using the T-Rex doxycycline-inducible Flp-In system (Invitrogen; (Tighe et al.,
2004)).
CRISPR/Cas9-edited HeLa cells with an inserted GFP tag in the Cterminus of the TTK/MPS1 gene product and HeLa cells stably expressing
GFP-MAD2 have been described before (Alfonso-Perez et al., 2019; Hayward
et al., 2019).
RNAi rescue assays
MPS1 siRNA rescue was performed by induction of GFP-MPS1 transgene for
6 h prior to a 48 h siRNA depletion of endogenous MPS1 using oligos against
the 3’UTR (3′ UTR: 5′-UUGGACUGUUAUACUCUUGAA-3′, 5′GUGGAUAGCAAGUAUAUUCUA-3′, and 5′-CUUGAAUCCCUGUGGAAAU-3’
(Hayward et al., 2019)). A second induction was performed 24 h into the
siRNA depletion. GFP-BubR1 was induced 6 h prior to a 48h siRNA depletion
of endogenous BubR1 using oligos against the 3’UTR (5’-

GCAATCAAGTCTCACAGAT-3′ (Espert et al., 2014)). A second induction was
performed 24 h into the siRNA depletion.

Mitotic Arrests and Inhibitions
Unless otherwise stated, mitotically arrested cells were generated by addition
of Nocodazole (0.3 µM, 2.5 h) followed by MG132 (20 µM, 0.5 h). Monastrol
washouts (Figures 5D, 5E, 5F) were performed by adding Monastrol at 100
µM for 2.5 h, followed by a washing cells 3 times with warm PBS and 3 times
with warm DMEM. In the case of Figure 5F, 20 µM MG132 was added for 60
min following washout. Cold treatment of cells (Figure 5H) was performed by
incubating cells at 4 °C for 9 min prior to fixation to depolymerise microtubules
that had not formed stable K-fibres. Inhibitor vehicle for all drugs was DMSO,
and DMSO alone was added as control.

Immunofluorescence microscopy and image processing
Cells were fixed with PTEMF (20mM PIPES-KOH pH 6.8, 0.2% [vol/vol] Triton
X-100, 1mM MgCl2, 10mM EGTA, and 4% [wt/vol] formaldehyde)(Dunsch et

em. 525/48), TRITC (ex. 542/27, em. 597/45) and Cy-5 (ex. 632/22, em.
676/34) were used to sequentially excite and collect fluorescence images on a
CoolSnap HQ2 CCD camera (Photometrics) using the software package
softWoRx (GE Healthcare). Cells were imaged using a 0.2µm interval and a
total stack of 2µm and deconvolved for presentation using softWoRx. Image
stacks were imported into FIJI (Schindelin et al., 2012) for maximum intensity
projection and saving as 8-bit TIFF files. TIFF files were imported into
Illustrator CS6 (Adobe) for figure production. For quantification imaging was
performed using a 60x/1.35na oil immersion objective on a BX61 Olympus
microscope equipped with filter sets for DAPI, EGFP/Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa
Fluor 555, and Alexa Fluor 647 (Chroma Technology Corp.), a CoolSNAP
HQ2 camera (Roper Scientific) and MetaMorph 7.5 imaging software (GE
Healthcare).
Quantification and Statistical Analysis
Image analysis was performed in FIJI and Excel (Microsoft). 10 Z-stacks with
a 0.2 µm interval were sum projected for analysis. Relative protein
kinetochore intensities (Figures 1B, 1C, 1E, 1F, 1H, 1I, 2B, 2C, 2E, 2F, 2H,
3B, 3C, S1D, S1E) were determined by placing a 10-pixel wide circular region
of interest over individual kinetochores and measuring the mean pixel
fluorescence, before dividing by the mean pixel intensity of the CENP-C
channel within the same ROI. A mean background (cytoplasm) intensity for
each cell is subtracted from each kinetochore protein or CENP-C
measurement. The mean protein fluorescence of each kinetochore was
divided by the mean kinetochore intensity of the total control population
(always the condition closest to the Y-axis, with a value of 1) to generate

relative values, which were plotted as bar graphs. > 15 cells per condition
were analysed with ≥ 10 kinetochores per cell. All immunofluorescence
experiments shown are representatives of at least two independent
experiments pooled together. Unless otherwise stated, error bars represent
the SEM, with N determined by the number of cells measured. Production of
graphs was performed on GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.) using
data exported from Excel. Statistical analysis of kinetochore intensities was
carried out in Excel or GraphPad Prism.
Inter-kinetochore distance
KNL1-KNL1 inter-kinetochore distance measurements were taken in a threedimensional space from 234 (WT) and 290 (DD) kinetochore pairs across 19
cells per condition from 2 independent experiments. Distances between a
kinetochore pair are plotted as individual points, with the mean distance
plotted as a black bar. Students T-test was performed to determine statistical
significance.
Kinetochore positioning measurements
Kinetochore positions were identified as the centre of mass of CENP-C
signals identified within the cell boundary following equal thresholding of
images, and were plotted in Figure 5B by distance in pixels from the centre of
the cell. 23 (WT) or 19 (DD) randomly selected cells were measured. There
was no significant difference (Student’s T-test) between the number of
identified kinetochores per cell in WT (mean=91, S.D.=17) and DD (mean=94,
S.D.=15). The alignment status of these kinetochores (Figure 5C) was
determined as defining aligned kinetochores as being positioned within the
50% region of the X-axis closest to the centre of a cell (i.e. within 25% either

side of the centre of the cell along the X-axis). Misaligned kinetochores are
therefore defined as being outside of this zone. Proportion of MAD1 and
MPS1 positive kinetochores were quantified as number of objects within the
cell boundary counted following equal thresholding of image channels.
Live cell microscopy and statistical analysis
Time-lapse imaging of cells with a paired control sample was performed on a
DeltaVision Elite light microscopy system as described for fixed cell samples.
Fluorescence images were collected on a 512x512 pixel EMCCD camera
(QuantEM, Photometrics) using the software package softWoRx (GE
Healthcare). Cells were placed in a 37°C and 5% CO2 environmental chamber
(Tokai Hit) on the microscope stage with lens heating collar. Cells were
seeded on 2-chambered glass bottomed dishes (Lab-Tek) at 30,000 per well.
SiR-Hoechst (Spirochrome) was added 8h prior to imaging at a final
concentration of 100nM. Typically, 7 planes were captured per cell 2µm apart
every 2min with laser powers at 2% and 25ms exposures. Deconvolution and
maximum intensity projections were performed using softWoRx, with image
cropping performed using FIJI.
All other time-lapse imaging was performed using an Ultraview Vox
spinning disc confocal system (Perkin Elmer) mounted on an Olympus IX81
inverted microscope, a 512x512 pixel EMCCD camera (ImagEM C9100-13,
Hamamatsu Photonics) and Volocity software. Cells were placed in a 37°C
and 5% CO2 environmental chamber (Tokai Hit) on the microscope stage with
lens heating collar. Imaging was performed using a 60x NA1.4 oil immersion
objective, 4–12% laser power and 30-200ms exposure time. Typically, 19
planes, 0.6µm apart were imaged every 2min. Maximum intensity projection

or summed projection of the fluorescent channels was performed in FIJI.
Statistical analysis of live cell imaging data (Figure 2C, Figure 4D) was carried
out in GraphPad Prism.
Protein expression and purification
FLAG-MPS1WT, FLAG-MPS1KD, FLAG-MPS1AA and FLAG-MPS1DD were
expressed and purified from HEK293T cells. For each construct, two 15 cm
dishes of cells were transfected with 8µg DNA, each, for 36h, including a 12h
nocodazole arrest. Cell pellets were lysed in 1ml lysis buffer (20mM Tris-HCl
pH 7.4, 300mM NaCl, 1% [vol/vol] Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor cocktail
(Sigma-Aldrich)). MPS1 was immunoprecipitated from the clarified
supernatants using 100µl FLAG-agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich). IPs were
washed twice with lysis buffer, four times with 20mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 300mM
NaCl, 0.1% [vol/vol] Triton X-100, two times with 20mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4,
300mM NaCl and once with 100mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4. GST-tagged KNL17281200

was expressed and purified as described before (Espert et al., 2014).

MPS1 kinase assays
For kinase assays, 1µg recombinant GST-Knl1728-1200 was phosphorylated
with 1µg recombinant FLAG-MPS1 on FLAG-agarose beads for 30min at
30°C in 50mM Tris-HCl pH 7.3, 50mM KCl, 10mM MgCl2, 20mM sodium βglycerophosphate, 15mM EGTA, 0.2mM ATP (cold assay) or 0.1mM ATP (hot
Assay), 1mM DTT, and 1µCi [32P]γ-ATP (hot assay) per reaction.
Incorporation of g32P into MPS1 or pKNL1875 intensity was used as a readout
of kinase activity. Coomassie stained bands of FLAG-MPS1 with incorporated
g32P on an SDS-PAGE were excised for scintillation counting. The mean
proportion ± SD of MPS1 construct activity (cpm) relative to WT was

determined across 2 independent experiments. The values were then
normalised to the number of available phosphorylation sites to account for the
fact that FLAG-MPS1AA and FLAG-MPS1DD were lacking two sites. These two
proteins were considered to have ten available sites and FLAG-MPS1WT and
FLAG-MPS1KD twelve (Dou et al., 2011; Tyler et al., 2009).
