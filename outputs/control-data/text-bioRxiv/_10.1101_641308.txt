Abstract
Extracellular electron transfer is the key process underpinning the development of
bioelectrochemical systems for the production of energy or added-value compounds.
Thermincola potens JR is a promising Gram-positive bacterium to be used in these systems
because it is thermophilic. In this paper we describe the structural and functional properties
of the nonaheme cytochrome OcwA, which is the terminal reductase of this organism. The
structure of OcwA, determined at 2.2Å resolution shows that the overall-fold and
organization of the hemes are not related to other metal reductases and instead are similar
to that of multiheme cytochromes involved in the biogeochemical cycles of nitrogen and
sulfur. We show that, in addition to solid electron acceptors, OcwA can also reduce soluble
electron shuttles and oxyanions. These data reveal that OcwA can take the role of a
respiratory ‘swiss-army knife’ allowing this organism to grow in environments with rapidly
changing availability of terminal electron acceptors without the need for transcriptional
regulation and protein synthesis.

Importance
Thermophilic Gram-positive organisms were recently shown to be a promising class of
organisms to be used in bioelectrochemical systems for the production of electrical energy.
These organisms present a thick peptidoglycan layer that was thought to preclude them to
perform extracellular electron transfer (i.e. exchange catabolic electrons with solid electron
acceptors outside of the cell). In this manuscript we describe the structure and functional
mechanisms of the multiheme cytochrome OcwA, the terminal reductase of the Grampositive bacterium Thermincola potens JR found at the cell surface of this organism. The
results presented here show that this protein is unrelated with terminal reductases found at
the cell surface of other electroactive organisms. Instead, OcwA is similar to terminal
reductases of soluble electron acceptors. Our data reveals that terminal oxidoreductases of
soluble and insoluble substrates are evolutionarily related, providing novel insights into the
evolutionary pathway of multiheme cytochromes.

Introduction
Iron is one of the most abundant metals in Earth’s crust, and microbial reduction of iron is
associated with some of the earliest life forms (1). Nowadays, this type of metabolism is used
for numerous biotechnological processes, including production of energy in microbial fuel
cells (MFC) and synthesis of added-value compounds in microbial electrosynthesis (MES) (2,
3). It is the ability to perform extracellular electron transfer that allows some microorganisms
to exchange electrons with an electrode in these devices (4). While microbes in MFCs donate
electrons to electrodes and generate electrical current (3), in MES the electrode oxidation
performed by bacteria is coupled to the production of chemicals on the cathode
compartment (5). Currently, about 100 microorganisms are known to perform extracellular
electron transfer and exchange electrons with an electrode (6). Most of these organisms are
Gram-negative bacteria (6); this is mainly because of the long-held view that the thick
peptidoglycan layer that encases Gram-positive bacteria prevents them from performing this
type of metabolism (7). However, recently it was described that Gram-positive bacteria are
also able to perform extracellular electron transfer (8, 9). The iron-reducing Gram-positive
bacterium Thermincola (T.) potens JR was identified in a current-producing MFC operating at
high temperature (10), whereas the closely related bacterium T. ferriacetica was isolated
from ferric deposits in a hydrothermal spring (11). These two thermophilic microorganisms
(10) were shown to produce higher current levels in MFC when compared with mesophilic
organisms in the same type of bioreactor (10, 12). Despite their faster kinetics and lower
interference from oxygen intrusion (12, 13), their application is still hindered by the lack of
knowledge of the molecular mechanism that they use for extracellular electron transfer. This
has a negative impact in the ability to optimize bioelectrochemical systems for the efficient
production of energy using this promising class of organisms.
Like Gram-negative electroactive organisms, Thermincola sp. contain a large number of genes
that code for multiheme c-type cytochromes (MHCs) (10, 14). Recently, a putative electron
transfer pathway was proposed for T. potens JR (8). In this pathway, the nonaheme
cytochrome TherJR_2595 (Tfer_3193 in T. ferriacetica) is located at the cell surface and was
proposed to be the terminal reductase for extracellular electron transfer (8). The
characterization of this protein is essential to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of electron
transfer at the electrode-microbe interface in Gram-positive bacteria.

In this work, we describe the structural and functional properties of TherJR_2595, hereafter
referred to as OcwA (Outer cell-wall protein A). The three-dimensional structure of this
protein reveals that it is unrelated to the structurally characterized outer-membrane MHCs
from Shewanella. Instead, it is structurally and functionally related with MHCs involved in the
biogeochemical cycles of nitrogen and sulfur, which suggests that terminal reductases that
use soluble and insoluble electron acceptors may be evolutionarily related. This work
provides the first insight into the molecular mechanisms of terminal reductases from
thermophilic Gram-positive bacteria, which underpin the direct and indirect electron transfer
to electrodes. This knowledge is crucial for the implementation of MFC with a broader
microbiological range and at more varied operational conditions, such as at high
temperatures.

Results
Production of OcwA
Recombinant OcwA was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity and identified as a band at
approximately 62 kDa in SDS-PAGE (Figure 1A). This band stained positively for covalently
attached hemes (Figure 1A), and N-terminal sequencing retrieved the predicted sequence of
OcwA (EKPAD) without the signal peptide, showing that the protein was efficiently processed
in E. coli. Size exclusion chromatography of pure OcwA revealed an approximately equal
mixture of monomer and dimer forms (Figure SM1). UV-visible spectra of OcwA showed the
typical features of a low-spin cytochrome c (Figure 1B), and NMR and EPR spectroscopy
indicated that this protein contains at least three types of hemes (Figure 2).

The 1H NMR spectrum of OcwA in the oxidized state presents signals outside of the protein
envelope up to 45 ppm (Figure 2A). These signals display a Curie-type temperature
dependence (Figure SM2), which are typical of the methyl groups of low-spin ferric (Fe3+)
hemes with two strong-field axial ligands such as histidines or methionines (15). Reduction of
OcwA with sodium dithionite revealed an NMR peak near -3 ppm (Figure 2B). This indicates
that besides the typical bis-histidine axial coordinated hemes, OcwA also contains at least one
heme that is axially coordinated by a methionine (16). Interestingly, this occurs even though
the amino acid sequence of OcwA contains enough histidines for all the nine hemes to be bishistidine coordinated.
Continuous-wave X-band EPR spectroscopy shows that reduced OcwA is silent whereas the
oxidized protein revealed a superposition of signals that suggest the presence of at least three
groups of paramagnetic species (Figure 2C). The shape of the spectrum shows clearly the
presence of magnetic interactions among the hemes, as often observed in MHCs and
expected due to the short distance between hemes in OcwA (as detailed in next section). The
signal with gmax=2.8 is characteristic of low-spin (S=1/2) six-coordinated hemes with axial
ligands approximately parallel with each other, whereas signals with gmax=3.5 are due to lowspin six-coordinated hemes with axial ligands perpendicular to each other (17). The resonance
at g ~ 6 indicates the presence of high-spin hemes (S=5/2) that are typically five-coordinated.
3D-structure of OcwA
The three-dimensional structure of OcwA was determined to 2.2 Ả resolution by X-ray
crystallography (Table SM1). OcwA is composed by a globular heme domain and a three-helix
bundle at the C-terminal. These three long a-helices are reminiscent of the pentaheme NrfA
(nitrite reductase) family of proteins (18) and of the octaheme cytochromes hydroxylamine
oxidoreductase (HAO) and (19) sulfite reductase MccA (Figure 3A) (20). The crystal structure
of OcwA shows that this protein forms a dimer, as observed experimentally by gel filtration
(Figure SM1). It spans about 180 × 81 × 45 Å, but presents only limited contact at the interface
between monomers involving two regions. While the first contact area is formed by the base
– but not the remainder – of the three-helix bundle, the second is made by a small alpha helix
and a neighboring loop from an additional beta-sheet domain (amino acids 75-156) within
the globular heme domain. This is an unprecedented monomer arrangement, where the

three-helix bundle does not dominate the formation of the dimer interface. This arrangement
may be a consequence of the decreased length of the C-terminal helices with respect to NrfA
proteins.

parallel rings. By contrast, hemes 4, 7 and 8 likely contribute to the EPR signal with g= 3.5 as
their axial histidines have nearly perpendicular rings. Heme 9 features a histidine-methionine
coordination, whereas hemes 2 and 5 have histidine as a proximal ligand and an open
coordination site at the distal position (Figure 3B), being thus responsible to the EPR signal
with g=6. These two hemes, located at opposite ends of the nine-heme arrangement, have
an almost identical environment, with a histidine serving as proximal iron ligand and a His-His
motif (HH 281/282 at heme 2 and HH 380/381 at heme 5) situated above the distal face of
the heme, which in both cases forms a solvent-exposed pocket. The presence of these two
penta-coordinated hemes that work as two putative active sites for substrate binding within
a single monomer is a novelty within the family of MHCs (21).
The organization of the hemes within OcwA, although vaguely reminiscent of the ‘staggeredcross’ design of the structurally characterized outer-membrane MHCs (22) (Figure 3C), clearly
follows a different design, that is similar to that of the NrfA family of proteins, with alternating
parallel and perpendicular di-heme packing motifs. In fact, hemes 1-4 of OcwA align with a
root-mean-squared deviation (rmsd) for all atoms of 0.84 Å with the hemes of the tetraheme
cytochrome c554 from Nitrosomonas europaea. In both proteins, heme 2 is the active site
(Figure 4B). Moreover, hemes 5-9 of OcwA can be superimposed with a rmsd of 0.89 Å to the
NrfA heme core structure (Figure 4C), with heme 5 of OcwA as the second active site.
Interestingly, hemes 1-4 and 6-9 also align with a rmsd of 0.89 Å to the heme core structure
of the sulfite reductase MccA (20), with heme 2 in both proteins acting as the active site
(Figure 4D). Although there is some correspondence of the polypeptides of cytochrome c554,
NrfA and MccA with the corresponding sections of OcwA, sequence similarity is only observed
for the heme-binding motifs, the distal heme ligands except for those of heme 2 and the
three-helix bundle. Furthermore, MccA and OcwA share the additional β-sheet domain that
has no equivalence in other NrfA family proteins (Figure SM3).

Electron transfer in OcwA
The redox behavior of OcwA was explored by cyclic voltammetry. The experimental
configuration used closely mimics the physiological context of this protein that is located at
the surface of T. potens JR and exchanges electrons with electrodes in MFCs. OcwA formed a
stable film at the surface of the pyrolytic graphite "edge" electrode and displayed reversible
electrochemistry over a wide potential window ranging from +100 mV (fully oxidized) to -450
mV (fully reduced) vs. SHE (Figure 5A). This potential window is similar to that previously
observed for other terminal reductases present at the cell surface of other electroactive
organisms (23). This range of potentials shows that OcwA may function as the terminal
reductase of T. potens JR, being responsible to transfer electrons to the electrode. Indeed,
the overall rate of interfacial electron transfer between OcwA and the electrode determined
from trumpet plots (Figure SM4) is approximately 150 s-1, which is in the same range as those
reported for other outer-membrane terminal reductases (~100 s-1) (24). Moreover, kinetic
experiments with amorphous iron oxide, which is known to sustain the growth of
Thermincola, showed that OcwA has the necessary reactivity to act as a terminal reductase in
this organism (Figure SM5).

Electrochemical titrations of OcwA followed by cyclic voltammetry, showed pH dependence
of the signals (Figure 5B), which is an indication that electron transfer is coupled to proton
transfer in the physiological range (i.e. redox-Bohr effect) (25, 26). This allows redox proteins
with multiple closely packed centers the possibility to become fully reduced, by balancing the
electrostatic repulsion that would arise from up taking multiple negative charges with the
uptake of protons.
Since T. potens JR was shown to use soluble electron shuttles (27), we tested the ability of
OcwA to interact with anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS), flavin mononucleotide (FMN),
riboflavin (RF) and phenazine methosulfate (PMS). These electron shuttles are typically found
in environments associated with electroactive microorganisms and AQDS is known to support
the growth of T. potens JR (10). Stopped-flow experiments showed that OcwA is oxidized by
the four electron shuttles tested (Figure 6A). The degree of oxidation of OcwA at the end of
the experiment is indicative of a thermodynamic equilibrium between the protein and the
electron shuttles, where the different endpoints observed correlate with the midpoint
reduction potential of the various electron shuttles (Figure 6B).

To assess the binding of the electron shuttles to OcwA we used 1H NMR spectroscopy. The
comparison of the high-frequency region spectra obtained for OcwA alone and after addition
of increasing amounts of the electron shuttles revealed no perturbation of the methyl signals
located outside of the protein envelope arising from low-spin hemes (Figure SM6). This
indicates that the binding of the electron shuttles may occur away from these methyl groups.
This is however in contrast with the observation for the outer-membrane MHCs from
Shewanella where the binding of soluble redox shuttles to MtrC, OmcA and UndA caused a
disturbance of the heme methyl signals (28).
Taking advantage of the phosphorous atom contained in FMN, 31P NMR experiments were
used to monitor the binding of this redox shuttle to OcwA. With increasing amounts of OcwA,
we observed that the FMN phosphorous signal broadens and diminishes in intensity (Figure
6C). These spectral changes arise from binding of FMN to OcwA in slow exchange regime on
the NMR timescale, which suggests a strong binding. This behavior is also different from what
was previously reported for the outer-membrane MHCs from S. oneidensis MR-1, where the
binding was transient and occurred in the fast regime on the NMR timescale (28).
Catalytic activity of OcwA
Prompted by the structural homology with the NrfA family of proteins, the reactivity with
nitrite, hydroxylamine and sulfite was tested, given that these are the most prevalent
substrates of this type of enzymes (Figure SM7). It was observed that OcwA can reduce nitrite,
but not sulfite in the conditions tested. Reduction and oxidation of hydroxylamine was also
observed.
For nitrite values of Vmax of 4 µmol/min.mg and KM of 65 µM were obtained, which are
significantly lower than those reported for the bona fide nitrite reductase pentaheme NrfA
(29). The lack of reduction of sulfite, may be explained by the lack of a copper atom, that
although not crucial for sulfite reduction activity (30), is present in the active site of the
homologous MccA (20).

Discussion
The importance of MHCs in extracellular electron transfer pathways of electroactive
organisms has made their structural and functional characterization a priority in the

bioelectromicrobiology field. This knowledge is even more significant for terminal reductases
that are present at the cell surface of these organisms, where the knowledge on their mode
of action is important to optimize the electron transfer process at the microbe-electrode
interface (31, 32).
Surface exposed OcwA is proposed to be the terminal reductase in T. potens JR extracellular
electron transfer pathway, where it bridges the contact between bacterial metabolism and
electrodes in MFC (8). BLAST P sequencing revealed an OcwA homolog in T. ferriacetica
(Tfer_3193) with which it shares 99% of identity (520/525 amino acids) including heme
binding motifs and axial ligands (Figure SM8), thus suggesting a similar role between both
proteins from different species of Thermincola sp. Given that a genetic system has not been
developed for Thermincola, the generation of knock-out strains that would confirm this
hypothesis is still not possible. Nonetheless, here, we have shown that OcwA from T. potens
JR fulfills the role of a terminal reductase for extracellular electron transfer. It is capable of
exchanging electrons with electrodes at similar rates to those of the surface exposed
cytochromes of Shewanella, previously characterized, and to reduce iron oxides.
The redox-Bohr effect presented by OcwA appears to match the needs of Thermincola when
growing as a biofilm at the surface of an electrode. As demonstrated by Lusk and co-workers
upon studying the rate-limiting enzymatic response responsible for the electrochemical signal
of T. ferriacetica (33), one of the key factors for the stability of electrochemically active
biofilms at the surface of electrodes is the efficient dissipation of pH gradients to maintain
the viability of the cells (34) and therefore the current generation (12). A similar protonelectron coupling is also found in the cell-surface exposed MHCs from Shewanella (23, 35).
Also in similarity with the MHCs from Shewanella, OcwA shows an internal organization of
the hemes that is neither globular nor linear but instead branched. This suggests that for the
MHCs found at the surface of electroactive bacteria, having multiple hemes that can work as
entry and exit electron points is an important design feature.
It is, however, at the level of the differences with previously characterized MHCs found at the
surface of Shewanella that OcwA expands our current understanding of nature to efficiently
perform extracellular electron transfer. OcwA shows for the first time in cell-surface MHCs a
variety of heme coordination environments, including the open distal axial coordination
position of hemes 2 and 5. High-spin hemes are typically associated with active sites where
substrates are bound, and chemical reactions take place. Interestingly, the heme-binding

motif of the high-spin hemes 2 and 5 in OcwA are not identical to the catalytic heme of most
known NrfA proteins (i.e. CXXCK motif), nor to the P460 catalytic heme of hydroxylamine
oxidising HAO, even though OcwA can perform both reactions. Although, organisms from
Thermincola sp. were never reported to grow in the presence of nitrite or hydroxylamine (10),
the ability of OcwA to reduce these substrates may be advantageous for cell survival in
anaerobic environments. Indeed, OcwA may work as a detoxifying enzyme when these
organisms encounter these compounds, which is a novelty for cell-surface terminal
reductases. Furthermore, OcwA interacts with soluble electron shuttles, namely FMN in a
distinct way of its counterparts from S. oneidensis, OmcA and MtrC whose interaction has
been proposed to be transient and modulated by redox active disulfide bridges (33, 36). In
fact, OcwA not only lacks such bridges but also binds strongly to FMN.
Finally, rather than being a truncated member of the MtrC/OmcA/UndA protein family lacking
one heme, OcwA is structurally related to NrfA, cytochrome c554 and MccA, which are key
proteins in the nitrogen and sulfur cycles. It was proposed that the octaheme cytochrome c
family evolved from duplication of an ancestral nrfA gene in delta-proteobacteria, which was
then extended by fusion with a triheme cytochrome c (21). The structure and catalytic
versatility of OcwA provides a more nuanced view of this evolutionary storyline, now in the
context of Gram-positive bacteria. From the structural point of view, OcwA can be described
as a pentaheme cytochrome fused to the tetrahemic scaffold of cytochrome c554. Indeed,
cytochromes of the NrfA, c554 and octaheme families are evolutionarily related (2, 21). The
structure of OcwA raises the possibility that the extant octaheme cytochromes evolved by the
loss of heme 2 (HAO) or heme 5 (MccA) from ancestral nonaheme cytochromes similar to
OcwA.
In conclusion, the structural and functional characterization of OcwA reveals that this
terminal reductase for extracellular electron transfer is unrelated to the known terminal
reductases, MtrC, OmcA and UndA. This indicates that the process of extracellular electron
transfer evolved independently more than once to accommodate the catabolic needs of
microorganisms living in environments with access to solid terminal electron acceptors.
Moreover, the particular case of OcwA reveals a multifunctional link between the
biogeochemical cycles of nitrogen and iron. Indeed, being able to react with electrodes, Noxides, iron and small molecule redox shuttles, OcwA may work as the respiratory ‘swiss-army

knife’ of Thermincola allowing this Gram-positive bacterium to grow and survive in
environments with variable access to solid and soluble electron acceptors.

Materials and Methods
Protein production and purification. The OcwA protein was produced according to the
literature (37) with minor changes using the primers listed in Table 1. Briefly, a chimeric gene,
containing the signal peptide of small tetraheme cytochrome c (stc) from S. oneidensis MR-1
fused with the gene sequence of therjr_2595 without native signal peptide was constructed.
E. coli JM109 (DE3) was co-transformed with this chimeric gene previously cloned into
pBAD202/D-TOPO vector (38) and plasmid pEC86 that contains the cytochrome c maturation
system (39). Transformed E.coli strain were cultured in TB medium with 50 µg kanamycin and
35 µg of chloramphenicol at 37°C for 6 hours. At mid log phase (~6 h after inoculation), the
temperature of the growing culture in TB medium previously set at 37°C was lowered to 30°C.
The cells were allowed to grow for additional 18 h and were then pelleted by centrifugation
at 10,000´g for 10 min at 4°C and resuspended in osmotic shock solution (0.2 M Tris-HCl (pH
7.6) with 0.5 M sucrose, 0.5 mM EDTA and 100 mg/L lysozyme) with protease inhibitor (Sigma)
and DNase (Sigma) using a ratio of 200 ml of osmotic shock solution for each 8L of culture
media. The spheroplast solution was incubated at 4°C for 40 min with gentle stirring. The
periplasmic fraction containing the recombinant protein was cleared by ultracentrifugation
at 200,000´g for 1h at 4°C and dialyzed overnight against 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6). The
dialyzed protein extract was purified via a His-trap column (GE Healthcare) previously
equilibrated with 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 20 mM imidazole and 500 mM NaCl (pH
7.6). To elute the bound protein, a single step was used with 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer,
300 mM Imidazole and 500 mM NaCl (pH 7.6). The resulting fraction was dialyzed overnight
against 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6). A diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-biogel column (Biorad) preequilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) was used as a final purification step. OcwA was
eluted in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer with 120 mM NaCl (pH 7.6). The purified protein was dialyzed
against 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) with 100 mM KCl. SDS-PAGE (12%
resolving gel) and UV-visible spectroscopy were used after each purification step to select the
fractions containing the target protein and to evaluate its purity. The purified protein had an
absorbance ratio (ASoret peak/A280nm) larger than 5.0.

Crystallization and structure determination. For structure determination, crystals were
grown in an anoxic chamber (Coy) under N2/H2 atmosphere (95/5 vol %) at room
temperature. Sitting drop vapor diffusion experiments were set up by adding 0.5 µL of protein
solution (6 mg/mL) to 0.5 µL of reservoir solution. Well-diffracting crystals were obtained in
conditions containing 24-27% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.1 M HEPES, pH 7-7.5 and 0.1-0.2 M
MgCl2 only after seeding. The crystals were harvested using 10% 2,3-butanediol as
cryoprotectant in mother liquor and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Datasets were collected
at the Swiss Light Source, Paul-Scherrer-Institut (Villigen, Switzerland) on beamline X06DA
with a Pilatus 2M Detector (Dectris). Initial phase information was obtained by single
anomalous diffraction with a dataset collected at the iron edge, l = 1.729 Å, using the PHENIX
suite (40) for automatic phasing and initial model building. An initial structural model was
refined in iterative steps using REFMAC5 (41) and COOT (42) to 2.7 Å resolution. This solution
was then used for molecular replacement with MOLREP (43) as part of the CCP4 suite (44) for
the more highly resolved structure at 2.2 Å. The final model comprised residues 42 to the very
C-terminus at residue 525 in chain A, and residues 43 to 525 in chain B. Coordinates and
structure factors have been deposited with the protein data bank under the accession code
6I5B. Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in supplementary table SM1.
NMR experiments. For all the NMR experiments, OcwA prepared in 20 mM potassium
phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) with 100 mM KCl was lyophilized and resuspended in D2O. An
excess of sodium dithionite was used to reduce the protein. 1H NMR experiments were
performed on a Bruker Avance II 500 MHz spectrometer equipped with a QXI probe for 1H
detection, and a SEX probe for 31P detection. All NMR data were processed in the Topspin 3.2

software. 1H NMR spectra were acquired before and after lyophilization to ensure that
protein integrity was preserved.
To study the influence of the electron shuttles on OcwA, NMR experiments were performed
as

previously

described

(28)

using

antraquinone-2,6-disulfonate

(AQDS),

flavin

mononucleotide (FMN), riboflavin (RF) and phenazine methosulfate (PMS). Stock solutions of
the different electron shuttles were prepared in 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6)
with 100 mM KCl. 1H NMR spectra performed at 25°C on a Bruker Avance II 500 MHz NMR
spectrometer equipped with TCI cryoprobe for 1H detection were acquired before and after
the addition of the electron shuttles (molar ratios 0.5:1, 1:1 and 3:1 electron shuttle:protein).
For the 31P-NMR binding experiments, samples containing 100 µM of FMN prepared in 20 mM
phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) with 100 mM KCl were titrated against increasing concentrations
of OcwA at 25°C.
EPR experiments. The OcwA solution was prepared in 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer
(pH 7.6) with 100 mM KCl to a final concentration of 200 μM. The reduced state was obtained
by addition of an excess of sodium borohydride. EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ESP
380 spectrometer equipped with an ESR 900 continuous-flow helium cryostat (Oxford
Instruments). Temperature: 7 K; microwave frequency: 9.39 GHz; modulation amplitude: 1.0
mT; microwave power: 2 mW.
Cyclic Voltammetry of OcwA. The electrochemical setup was assembled as previously
described (45, 46). Electrochemical measurements were performed in an anaerobic glovebox
(JACOMEX, France) with a nitrogen atmosphere (residual O2 < 1 ppm). A pyrolytic graphite
edge electrode (PGE surface approx. 3 mm2) was polished with alumina slurry (Buehler, 1μm)
and then coated with 0.5 μl of a solution of OcwA (stock solution previously diluted in 20 mM
potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) with 100 mM KCl to a final concentration of 50 μM) and
left to dry for approximately 5 min. The buffers used in the electrochemical experiments were
prepared by mixing 5 mM of HEPES, MES and TAPS and 100 mM KCl. The desired pH values
were adjusted with 1 M NaOH or HCl solutions. Experiments were performed at 25°C using
an electrochemical cell consisting of an Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) reference electrode in a
Luggin sidearm and a platinum wire counter electrode. Cyclic voltammetry was performed
with an Autolab electrochemical analyzer (PGSTAT-128N) with an analogue scan generator

controlled by GPES software. The potentials are quoted with reference to standard hydrogen
electrode (SHE) by addition of 0.197 V to those measured (47). The electrochemical data were
analyzed using the QSOAS program available at www.qsoas.org (48).
Kinetic experiments between OcwA and electron shuttles. Protein oxidation experiments
were performed according to Paquete et al. 2014 (28) in a stopped-flow apparatus (SHU61VX2 from TgK Scientific) placed inside an anaerobic chamber (M-Braun 150) containing less
than 5 ppm of oxygen. The concentration of protein, approximately 0.4 µM after mixing was
determined for each experiment by UV-visible spectroscopy using ε409nm of 125.000 M–1 cm–
1

per heme for the oxidized state of the protein (46, 49). Stock solutions (5 mM) of the electron

shuttles antraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS), flavin mononucleotide (FMN), riboflavin (RF)
and phenazine methosulfate (PMS) were prepared by dissolving weighted amounts of solid
reagents in 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) with 100 mM KCl. Dilutions of the
electron shuttles were prepared in degassed buffer, and their concentrations were
determined by UV-visible spectroscopy using the following extinction coefficients ε326nm =
5200 M−1 cm−1 for AQDS (50), ε445nm = 12,200 M−1 cm−1 for FMN (51), ε445nm = 12,500 M−1 cm−1
for RF (52), and ε387nm = 26,300 M−1cm−1 for PMS (53). Reduced OcwA was obtained by mixing
the protein with small volumes of concentrated sodium dithionite solution. UV-visible
spectroscopy was used to confirm that there was no excess of dithionite using ε314nm =8.000
M–1 cm–1 (54). Oxidation by electron shuttles was monitored by measuring the absorption
changes at 552 nm upon mixing reduced OcwA with each of them. The temperature of the
kinetic experiments was maintained at 25ºC using an external circulating bath (28).
Catalytic experiments with OcwA. The enzymatic reduction of sulfite, nitrite and
hydroxylamine by OcwA was tested at 55ºC in an anaerobic chamber (Coy). All the assays
were performed in 50 mM potassium phosphate (KPi) buffer at pH 7.0, with 1 mM methyl
viologen previously reduced with zinc granules as described in the literature (30). The reaction
was started by the addition of the substrate, followed by OcwA, and the reaction was
monitored by the oxidation of methyl viologen at 732 nm. Sodium sulfite concentrations were
tested in the range of 100 µM to 6 mM, while sodium nitrite was tested in the range 20 µM
to 150 µM, and hydroxylamine in the range 10 µM to 200 µM. The final concentrations of

OcwA ranged from 50 to 400 nM measured prior to the experiments using ε409 nm of 125.000
M-1 cm-1 per heme for the oxidized state of the protein.
The enzymatic oxidation of hydroxylamine by OcwA was tested using 20 µM of phenazine
methosulfate (PMS) and 400 µM of 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium
bromide (MTT) as electron acceptors (19). The reaction was started by the addition of
hydroxylamine (75 µM to 500 µM), followed by 100 µM OcwA, and the reduction of MTT was
monitored at 578 nm.
The enzymatic reduction of amorphous iron (III) oxide by OcwA was also performed at 55ºC
in the same anaerobic chamber. Amorphous iron (III) oxide was prepared as described in (11),
a solution of FeCl3 was titrated with 10% (w/v) NaOH (pH 11) and brown precipitate was
formed. In each assay iron (III) oxide was added to 488 nM OcwA, previously reduced with
sodium dithionite, in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Iron (III) oxides were tested
in the range of 14.3 to 55.5 mg/L. UV-visible spectra of OcwA were obtained as isolated
(oxidized state), after the addition of sodium dithionite (reduced state), and after addition of
the iron oxides. All solutions were previously degassed.
