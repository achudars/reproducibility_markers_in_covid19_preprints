Abstract

17

Diagnostic tests for foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) include the detection of antibodies

18

against either the viral non-structural proteins or the capsid. The detection of antibodies against

19

the structural proteins (SP) of the capsid can be used to monitor seroconversion in both infected

20

and vaccinated animals. However, SP tests need to be tailored to the individual FMD virus

21

serotype and their sensitivity performances may be affected by antigenic variability within each

22

serotype and mismatching between tests reagents. As a consequence, FMD Reference

23

Laboratories need to maintain contingency to employ multiple type-specific assays for large-

24

scale serological surveillance and post-vaccination monitoring in the event of FMD outbreaks.

25

In this study, a highly conserved region in the N terminus of FMDV capsid protein VP2 (VP2N)

26

was characterised using a panel of intertypic-reactive monoclonal antibodies. This revealed a

27

universal epitope in VP2N which could be used as a peptide antigen to detect FMDV-specific

28

antibodies against all types of the virus. A VP2-peptide ELISA (VP2-ELISA) was optimised

29

using experimental and reference antisera from immunized, convalescent and negative animals

30

(n=172). The VP2-ELISA is universal, simple and provided sensitive (98.6 %) and specific

31

(93%) detection of antibodies to all FMDV strains used in this study. We anticipate that this

32

SP test could have utility for sero-surveillance during virus incursions in FMD-free countries

33

and as an additional screening tool to assess FMD virus circulation in endemic countries.

Introduction

38

Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is an economically devastating viral disease of cloven-

39

hoofed animals with a global distribution. It limits access to markets for developing countries

40

and outbreaks in otherwise FMD-free countries are expensive to control (as in the UK in 2001,

41

Japan in 2010 and the Republic of Korea in 2010 and 2011) [1, 2]. FMD virus (FMDV) is a

42

single-stranded, positive-sense, RNA virus belonging to the genus Aphthovirus in the family

43

Picornaviridae. The virus exists as seven serotypes (O, A, C, Asia 1, South African Territories

44

(SAT)1, SAT2 and SAT3) as well as numerous and constantly evolving strains showing a

45

spectrum of antigenic diversity.

46

The non-enveloped picornavirus capsid has icosahedral symmetry, a diameter of

47

approximately 30 nm and is composed of 60 copies of each of the capsid proteins VP1, VP2,

48

VP3 and VP4. VP1, VP2 and VP3 are the major components of the capsid, while VP4 is a

49

small (approximately (12 kDa) internal protein which lies on the inside surface of the capsid

50

around the five-fold axes of symmetry, where it is thought to stabilise interactions between

51

pentameric capsid subunits [3, 4]. During the replication cycle of FMDV, eight different viral

52

non-structural proteins (NSPs; and additional precursors) are generated which are potential

53

serological targets for diagnostic assays [5]. The presence of antibodies against NSPs can be

54

used to differentiate infected and vaccinated animals (DIVA) because such antibodies are only

55

produced by infection and are not elicited after administration with purified vaccines. In

56

addition, the inter-serotypic conservation of the NSPs means this type of test is compatible with

57

all serotypes of FMDV. Hence, NSP tests can be used as generic screening tools to support

58

national programs to attain the OIE status of FMD-freedom with or without vaccination [6, 7,

59

8]. However, the specificity of these tests is less than 100% [9] and testing algorithms that are

60

designed to confirm absence of FMDV circulation in large populations usually adopt screening

61

and confirmatory serological assays with covariant rates of false positivity [7, 8, 9]. In this

62

context, ELISAs that measure FMDV-specific antibodies directed at capsid structural proteins

63

(SP) are widely used to augment NSP tests for sero-surveillance activities [10, 11, 12, 13]. One

64

of the international standard tests for FMDV antibody detection is the virus neutralisation test

65

(VNT) [14]. However, the VNT is laborious, rendering large scale serological testing difficult.

66

In addition, the procedure requires live virus, thus confining the test to high containment

67

laboratories in non-endemic countries. SP ELISAs with high diagnostic sensitivity are also

68

available for certification of animals as free from FMD prior to import and export, for

69

serological confirmation of FMDV infection, for post vaccination monitoring and for the

70

demonstration of vaccine efficacy [14]. However, SP assays need to be tailored to individual

71

serotypes and as a consequence FMD Reference Laboratories need to maintain parallel assay

72

systems to accommodate the possibility of FMD outbreak due to different virus serotypes.

73

A number of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have previously been reported with cross-

74

reactivity against multiple FMDV serotypes [15, 16, 17]. The recognition sites for some of

75

these mAbs have been mapped to a highly conserved region at the N-terminus of VP2 [15, 16,

76

17]. In this study, a highly conserved region in the N terminus of FMDV capsid protein VP2

77

(VP2N) was characterised using a panel of cross-reactive mAbs. This revealed a universal

78

epitope in VP2N which has been investigated as a peptide antigen to detect FMDV-specific

79

antibodies in serum samples from animals infected or vaccinated with any of the FMDV

80

serotypes.

Material and Methods

83

Cells lines and Viruses

84

The IBRS-2 (pig kidney) cell line and the BHK-21 (baby hamster kidney 21) cell line, used

85

for FMD viruses propagation and immunoassays, were maintained either in Dulbecco’s

86

modified Eagle’s medium or in Minimum Essential Medium, (DMEM; Thermo-Fisher

87

Scientific, UK) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated foetal bovine serum (FBS; Thermo-

88

Fisher Scientific, UK) and 100 U of penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma) per ml. FMDV strains

89

used are indicated in each relevant paragraph.

90

Peptides

91

Peptides representing the N-terminal 15 (VP2N15), 30 (VP2N30) or 45 (VP2N45) amino

92

acids of FMDV VP2 were synthesised (Peptide Protein Research, UK) without modifications

93

except for the addition of 6 lysines at the C-terminus of the peptides to increase the solubility.

94

VP2N45 was used for the development of the peptide ELISA. A control peptide equivalent to

95

a capsid sequence from the related picornavirus human rhinovirus was used [18]. Eight

96

peptides (15mer each) overlapping by ten amino acids , covering the first 45 amino acids

97

from the N-terminus of the FMDV capsid sequence, were used for the fine mapping of the

98

epitope (Fig.1a).

99

Serum samples

100

Sera from infected cattle with FMDV O/UKG 34/2001 [19] was used to optimise the ELISA.

101

Reference sera from experimentally vaccinated or infected animals were supplied by FAO

102

World Reference Laboratory for FMD (WRLFMD, The Pirbright Institute). The parameters

103

of selecting serum samples were as follows: Negative (n=100): samples that been collected

104

from negative coherent country (during the UK 2007 outbreak). These samples are from non-

105

vaccinated animals and proved to be negative using NSP-ELISA. Positive (n=72): samples

106

that are known to be infected or vaccinated with FMDV. Selection of the positive samples

107

was based up on more than 7days post vaccination or infection to ensure a positive response.

108

See supplementary table (1) for more details.

109

Production of mAbs

110

The following FMD viruses were used as immunogens to produce mAbs in mice and for the

111

following selection of heterotypic cross-reactive mAbs: serotype A Malaysia 16/97, C1

112

Brescia 1964, Asia 1 Nepal 29/97, A24 Cruzeiro and O UK 31/2001.

113

For each immunogen, BALB/c mice were primed subcutaneously with 20μg of purified FMD

114

virus in Freund’s complete adjuvant and boosted intraperitoneally with the same antigen in

115

phosphate buffered saline (PBS) once or twice at one-month intervals. Three days after the

116

last boost, mice were humanely sacrificed and hybridomas were generated by fusion of

117

splenocytes with NS0 myeloma cells following standardized procedures [20]. Briefly, at least

118

108 spleen cells were recovered from each mouse and fused with NS0 myeloma cells at a

119

10:1 ratio using PEG 4000. Fused cells diluted in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium,

120

supplemented with hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine and 20% fetal calf serum, were

121

distributed over five microplates (200μl per well). Growing colonies were observed in all

122

wells; in order to select hybridomas secreting monoclonal antibodies specific for the

123

immunogen, the supernatants were screened by trapping ELISAs against the homologous

124

virus strains. Selection of the inter-types cross reactive mAbs was based on results of the

125

trapping ELISA against the homologous and heterologous virus serotypes, as previously

126

described [21]. The selected hybridoma cells were cloned by limiting dilution in order to

127

obtain antibodies from one single cell. The supernatant from exhausted cultures was then

128

used as source of mAb.

Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy

131

IBRS-2 cells on 13-mm glass coverslips (VWR) were infected with FMDV type O1

132

Kaufbeuren (MOI = 2) for 3.75 hours and then washed with PBS and fixed with 4%

133

paraformaldehyde for 40 min at room temperature (RT). The cells were then permeabilized

134

for 20 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 prepared in blocking buffer (Tris-buffered saline

135

supplemented with 1 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 10% normal goat serum, and 1% fish skin

136

gelatin). The cells were then incubated with primary antibody (mouse mAb 4A3) diluted

137

1/1000 in blocking buffer for 1h at RT. Subsequently, the cells were washed and incubated

138

with Alexa-Fluor-conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa-568; Thermo

139

Fisher Scientific, UK) in blocking buffer for 45 min at RT. After washing, the cells were

140

mounted using Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)

141

(Vector Labs) and the coverslips sealed with nail varnish. All data were collected sequentially

142

using a Leica SP8 confocal laser scanning microscope.

143
144

SDS-PAGE and western blot

145

Initial tests to verify the reactivity in western blot of each mAb with the homologous partially

146

purified strain were performed as previously described [21]. Later on, the cross-reactivity of

147

one representative mAb (4A3) with all FMDV serotypes was confirmed as follows.

148

Virus lysates from IBRS-2 cells infected cells with different FMDV serotypes were denatured

149

and reduced by heating at 95°C for 5min in Red Loading Buffer and DTT (NEB). The samples

150

were resolved through 12% Tris-glycine gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane

151

(0.45μM, GE Healthcare) using a Mini-Protean tetra cell (BioRad). Membranes were placed in

152

blocking buffer (20mM Tris, 150mM NaCl pH7.6 with 0.1% v/v tween-20 (TBS-T) with 1%

153

bovine serum albumin (BSA) w/v (Melford)) for 1h at RT followed by incubation with

154

hybridomas supernatants (mAbs) and anti-mouse HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Dako)

155

(1/5000 in blocking buffer) in sequence for 1h at RT. Each incubation was separated by cycles

156

of three washings with TBS-T. West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Fisher

157

Scientific, UK) was added to the membrane and exposures of the membrane were collected

158

and visualised using a G: Box Chemi XX6 (Syngene).

159

Serological standard tests: virus neutralisation test (VNT), liquid-phase blocking

160

ELISA (LPBE), solid-phase competition ELISA (SPCE) and commercial kits

161

(PrioCHECKTM FMDV Type O, Type A and Type Asia 1 Antibody ELISA kits)

162

VNT was carried out in microplates against 100 TCID50 of the homologous or heterologous

163

viruses and results were reported as the final dilution required to neutralize 50 % of the

164

inoculated cultures [14]. The LPBE and the SPCE were carried out as described by Hamblin

165

et al., (1986) [12] and by Paiba et al., (2014) [13] respectively. The cut offs used in the VNT

166

(log titre 1.65), LPBE (log titre 1.95) and SPCE (40% of inhibition) were according to the

167

standard operating procedures for the WRLFMD (The Pirbright Institute, UK). PrioCHECK

168

ELISAs for FMDV type O, A and Asia 1 antibody were carried out according to the kits

169

instructions, with 50% of inhibition as cut-offs.

170

The frequency distribution of values generated by various serological assays for the negative

171

and the positive (vaccinated and infected animals) serum samples were plotted using

172

GraphPad Prism (V7). Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism V7 for

173

Windows (GraphPad Software, La Jolla California USA, www.graphpad.com).

174

Indirect ELISAs and the development of the VP2 ELISA

175

Plastic 96-well plates (Maxisorp –Nunc) were coated with 100μl per well of the peptides in

176

0.05M standard carbonate/bicarbonate coating buffer (pH 9.6) at 4°C overnight. Different

177

peptides concentrations, ranging from 125ng/ml up to 4µg/ml, were initially evaluated for

178

test optimization. Wells were washed three times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS)

179

containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) between all incubations. Wells were blocked with 200μl

180

blocking buffer (1% w/v BSA in PBS-T) at 37°C for 1h, and incubated either with 100μl of

181

mAb (hybridoma supernatants, 1/5) or bovine sera (diluted 1:50 to 1 in 400 in blocking

182

buffer) at 37°C for 1h. Antibody binding was detected by incubation at 37°C for 1h with

183

100μl of species specific HRP conjugated secondary antibodies (Dako), diluted in blocking

184

buffer 1:1,000 in case of anti-mouse Ig conjugate or 1:15,000 for the anti-bovine-Ig conjugate

185

. The chromogen development was mediated by the addition of 50μl of HRP substrate (OPD:

186

Sigma FAST, Sigma, UK). The reaction was stopped after 20min by addition of 50μl of

187

1.25M sulphuric acid and the optical density (OD) was measured at 490nm.

Results

189

Characterisation of an FMDV-VP2 conserved epitope by cross reactive mAbs

190

Among the multiplicity of mAbs generated from mice independently immunized with four

191

different FMDV serotypes (A Malaysia 16/97, C1 Brescia 1964, Asia 1 Nepal 29/97, A24

192

Cruzeiro, or O UK 31/2001), seven mAbs were selected because of their cross-reactivity with

193

the seven FMDV serotypes. All mAbs were characterised as non-neutralising. Five of these

194

mAbs strongly recognised the capsid protein VP2 by western blot and showed a weaker

195

reaction with VP0, while two mAbs reacted with P1 (Table 1).

196

Previous studies have identified the conserved N-terminus of VP2 as a site for recognition by

197

cross-reactive mAbs [15, 16, 17]. We therefore tested the reactivity of the seven mAbs

198

against peptides equivalent to the first 15 (VP2N15), 30 (VP2N30) or 45 (VP2N45) amino

199

acids of the N-terminus of VP2 from FMDV O1K (Fig.1a). The N-terminus of VP2 is known

200

to be most highly conserved within the first 15 amino acids. The five mAbs (4D1, 1D6, 4A3,

201

5B2 and 5F10) identified as VP2-specific by Western blots also reacted strongly with the

202

VP2 peptides in ELISA (Fig.1b). Among them, two mAbs (4A3 and 5B2) showed an

9

203

equivalent reactivity with the three peptides, while the three remaining mAbs recognized the

204

VP2N15 peptide with lower intensity (Fig.1b). The mAb 4A3 was taken forward for further

205

characterisation. In particular, fine mapping using 15mer peptides with 10 amino acids

206

overlaps (Fig.1a) showed that mAb 4A3 reacted with the 15mer peptide that corresponded to

207

the N-terminus of VP2 and not with a 15mer starting at amino acid 6, confirming the

208

presence of an epitope at the N-terminus of VP2 (Fig.1c). The mAb 4A3 specifically detected

209

a protein band in western blot of the expected size for VP2 in cell lysates from infections

210

with all 7 serotypes (Fig.1d) confirming that the epitope is linear, conserved and specific for

211

VP2. MAb 4A3 also recognised virus infected cells when used as the primary antibody in

212

indirect immunofluorescence microscopy of IBRS-2 cell cultures infected with type O

213

FMDV (Fig.1e).

214
215

VP2N peptides detect antibodies in sera from animals infected with all serotypes of
FMDV

216

An indirect ELISA using peptides VP2N15, VP2N30 or VP2N45 was used to assess the

217

presence of antibodies against the N-terminus of VP2 in a representative serum from an animal

218

infected with type O FMDV. All three peptides captured antibodies, with the longer peptides

219

producing a slightly higher signal (Fig.2a). A control peptide equivalent to a capsid sequence

220

from the related picornavirus human rhinovirus gave a low signal consistent with background.

221

The longer peptide VP2N45 was then used to test monovalent sera from different animals

222

vaccinated against the seven serotypes of FMDV; this showed that the same peptide was able

223

to detect antibodies against all the serotypes (Fig.2b).

224

Development of a VP2 ELISA for universal detection of FMDV antibodies

225

A VP2 ELISA using peptide VP2N45 was developed using reference sera. The optimal

226

concentration of peptide and dilution of sera to be used in the test was first evaluated by

10

227

checkerboard titrations using bovine sera known to be negative or strongly positive or weakly

228

positive for antibody by existing tests. The best signal to noise ratio (positive: negative) was

229

obtained using a serum dilution of 1 in 100 and peptide concentration of 2μg/ml (Fig S.1). At

230

these optimised conditions, the cut off for distinguishing between positive and negative

231

signals was set as 0.4 OD units, calculated using the average value of three independent tests

232

using the standard negative reference serum sample used by WRLFMD for routine FMDV

233

diagnostics.

234

Using the optimized assay conditions, a collection of previously characterized serum samples

235

was tested in triplicate and repeated twice independently, representing naïve cattle (n=100)

236

and cattle vaccinated (n=38) or infected (n=34) with all seven serotypes of FMDV. The

237

majority of vaccinated and infected (positive) samples gave a relatively strong signal

238

(average absorbance value of 1.4) and the majority of naïve (negative) samples gave a

239

relatively low signal below 0.4 (Fig.3a).

240

Seven negative sample exceeded the cut off of 0.4 OD units (ranging between 0.4 and 1.0

241

OD) and would be considered false positive, therefore producing a diagnostic specificity for

242

the test of 93%. The signal for one positive sample (type A vaccinated) was below this cut off

243

and would be considered a false negative in this test giving a sensitivity of 98.6%.

244

Comparison of the VP2 ELISA with existing tests (VNT, LPBE, SPCE and

245

PrioCHECK)

246

For the positive serum samples analyzed by VP2 ELISA in Fig.3a, pre-existing WRLFMD

247

data generated using established diagnostic tests was accessed retrospectively and used to

248

compare the performance of the VP2 ELISA. The pre-existing data was generated with four

249

tests: VNT to quantitate neutralising antibodies, LPBE, SPCE and PrioCHECK to quantitate

250

anti-capsid antibodies. The sensitivity of the VNT, LPBE and SPCE are dependent on close

251

antigenic match between reagents used (virus/antigen and antibodies) and the serum sample

252

being tested. Therefore, the data from VNT and LPBE were subdivided into groups carried

253

out with homologous (same virus used to vaccinate or infect the animal) or heterologous

254

(same serotype but strain different than those used to vaccinate or infect the animal) reagents.

255

The data obtained with PrioCHECK kits was only available for samples from infections with

256

serotypes O, A and Asia 1.

257

As mentioned above, the VP2 ELISA data (Fig.3a) contained a single false negative

258

equivalent to a sensitivity of 98.6%. In comparison, the homologous VNT data (n=37) had no

259

false negatives (sensitivity of 100%) while the heterologous VNT data (n=72) had a

260

sensitivity of 73.2% (Fig.3b and Table 2). Similarly, the homologous LPBE data (n=30) had

261

no false negatives (sensitivity of 100%) and the heterologous LPBE data (n=72) had several

262

false negatives (sensitivity of 93.0%) (Fig.3c and Table 2). The SPCE data (n=72) had a

263

single false negative (sensitivity of 98.6%) (Fig. 3d and Table 2) and the PrioCHECK data

264

(n=29) had two false negatives (sensitivity of 93.1%) (Fig. 3d and Table 2).

265

The single false negative sample (A Eritrea 3/98- 41dpv) in the VP2 ELISA was also a false

266

negative in both the heterologous VNT (log titer =1.04) and heterologous LPBE (log

267

titre=1.6), but was positive in homologous VNT (log titer of 2.06) and weakly positive in the

268

SPCE (52 % inhibition) and PrioCHECK (65 % inhibition).

269

Overall these results show that the VP2 ELISA detected antibody to all serotypes and the OD

270

values may provide an estimate of the level of antibodies. The sensitivity of the new test

271

resulted equivalent to or better than PrioCHECK kits and SPCE; sensitivity was significantly

272

higher than LPBE and VNT when such assays are carried out with heterologous reagents.

Discussion

274

This study describes the development of a novel assay for the detection of antibodies against

275

the FMDV capsid that can be used to test for seroconversion in infected or vaccinated animals.

276

The benefits of this assay are that FMDV-specific SP antibodies from all seven serotypes can

277

be detected without the requirement for individual specific antigen or antibody reagents that

278

are required for existing tests such as VNT, LPBE, SPCE.

279
280

This assay targets a capsid epitope at the N-terminus of VP2 that exhibits high sequence

281

conservation among all seven serotypes of FMDV. Cross-reactive mAbs and overlapping

282

peptides were used to show that the minimum sequence required for this linear epitope was

283

VP2-N 1-DKKTE-5. This is consistent with previous studies, where structures of the FMDV

284

capsid suggested that the N-terminus of VP2 is an internal component but may be flexible

285

allowing it to be present at the surface to contribute to antigenicity [22, 23, 24]. In addition, the

286

production of monoclonal antibodies to VP2 N-terminus in response to immunisation with

287

FMDV, suggested that capsid flexibility may expose some of the internal domains of the capsid

288

proteins to the surface enabling them to become antigenic sites [15,16, 17]. It has also been

289

reported that a purified recombinant 1AB (VP4/VP2) capsid protein was detected by antisera

290

against all seven FMDV serotypes, indicating that the VP4/VP2 protein contained a highly

291

conserved epitope. Peptides containing the VP2 N-terminal epitope were reactive with

292

antibodies against all seven FMDV serotypes and one (VP2N45) was selected as the basis of a

293

novel VP2 ELISA that was evaluated with a panel of reference sera from naïve (n=100),

294

vaccinated (n=38) and infected (n=34) cattle, representative of all the seven FMDV serotypes.

295

Results demonstrated that the VP2 ELISA detected antibody to all serotypes with a diagnostic

296

specificity of 93% and sensitivity of 98.6%. The sensitivity of the new ELISA was equivalent

297

to or better than existing tests, such as PrioCHECK kits and SPCE; sensitivity was significantly

298

higher than LPBE and VNT carried out with heterologous reagents.

299

The VP2 ELISA is suitable for detection of antibodies against the capsid of FMDV either post

300

vaccination or post infection. The capture antigen contains a universally conserved viral

301

epitope that is expected to be present on any isolate of FMDV, this ensures that the VP2-ELISA

302

is able to detect FMDV antibodies regardless of the viral strain. In contrast to the biological

303

reagents necessary in many other ELISA, the VP2 capture antigen is a synthetic peptide, greatly

304

facilitating standardisation, continuity of supply and reproducibility. More importantly, it does

305

not require the optimisation and re-validation when serum from antigenic distant strains needs

306

to be tested.

307

Serological testing is a suitable tool for FMD surveillance. Detection of NSP antibodies

308

currently offers the advantages of a DIVA and cross-serotype test. However, the VP2 ELISA

309

can be used as a complementary or confirmatory test to the NSP ELISA, which is especially

310

useful in obtaining FMDV free status after an outbreak. As for the NSP ELISA, the VP2 ELISA

311

can also be used as (1) a front-line sero-surveillance assay in areas which are normally free

312

from FMD without vaccination, (2) for areas conducting surveillance to achieve free from

313

vaccination status, and (3) at the point of import and export to confirm the freedom of animals

314

from FMDV antibodies. The test may also provide a simple approach for evaluating vaccine

315

efficacy in experimental and field trails, although additional studies would need to be carried

316

out to determine the cut-off that correlates to protection.

317

In conclusion, the results suggest that the VP2 ELISA developed for the detection of antibodies

318

to FMDV has potential applications as a rapid, simple and inexpensive test in the sero-diagnosis

319

of FMDV and in sero-surveillance programmes. Further validation and standardisation will be

320

required to confirm the potential benefits of the VP2 ELISA.
