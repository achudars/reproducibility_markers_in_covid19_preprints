Abstract

16

Footrot is a worldwide economically important, painful, contagious bacterial hoof disease of

17

domestic and wild ungulates caused by Dichelobacter nodosus (D. nodosus). Benign and virulent

18

strains have been identified in sheep presenting mild and severe lesions, respectively. However, in

19

Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) both strains have been associated with severe, fatal lesions. In Switzerland a

20

nationwide footrot control program for sheep focusing on the virulent strain shall soon be

21

implemented. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to estimate the nationwide prevalence of

22

both strains of D. nodosus in four wild indigenous ruminant species and to identify potential

23

susceptible maintenance hosts that could be a reinfection source for sheep. During two years (2017-

24

2018), interdigital swabs of 1,821 wild indigenous ruminants species (Alpine ibex; Alpine chamois,

25

Rupicapra rupicapra; roe deer, Capreolus capreolus; red deer, Cervus elaphus) were analysed by Real-

26

Time PCR. Furthermore, observed interspecies interactions were documented for each sample.

27

Overall, we report a low prevalence of D. nodosus in all four indigenous wild ruminants, for both the

28

benign (1.97%, N = 36, of which 31 red deer) and virulent (0.05%, N = 1) strain of D. nodosus. Footrot

29

lesions were documented in one ibex with the virulent strain, and in one ibex with the benign strain.

30

Interactions with domestic livestock occurred mainly with cattle and sheep. In conclusion, the data

31

suggest that domestic ungulates represent a significant source of infection for wild ungulates, while

32

wild ruminants are likely irrelevant for the maintenance and spread of D. nodosus. Furthermore, we

33

add evidence that both D. nodosus strains can be associated with severe disease in Alpine ibex. These

34

data are crucial for the upcoming nationwide control program and reveal that wild ruminants should

35

not be considered as a threat to footrot control in sheep in this context.

Introduction

40

Footrot is an economically important, painful, contagious bacterial disease that affects

41

hooves of both domestic and wild ungulates (1,2). Among domestic ruminants, mainly sheep

42

are affected. Footrot is endemic in sheep flocks worldwide, including Switzerland (3). In free-

43

ranging wildlife, footrot has been documented in Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) and mufflon (Ovis

44

orientalis) (1,4). Since the treatment of wild ungulates in the field is challenging, expensive,

45

and neither practicable nor desired by wildlife managers, severe lesions do not just affect

46

animal welfare but typically result in death (4,5). Considering that Alpine ibex in Switzerland

47

have just recovered from the verge of extinction in the 20th century (6), outbreaks of footrot

48

may be relevant to species conservation.

49

The main etiologic agent of footrot is Dichelobacter nodosus (D. nodosus) (7). Lesions begin as

50

a mild interdigital inflammation and may progress to a separation of the horn from the

51

underlying skin (8). Benign and virulent strains have been identified in sheep presenting mild

52

and severe foot lesions, respectively (9). However, in Alpine ibex the benign strain was also

53

found in association with severe lesions (4). Furthermore, both strains of D. nodosus have

54

been detected in absence of lesions in sheep, cattle, goats and swine (10–13), suggesting the

55

existence of species-specific differences in disease susceptibility and the involvement of other

56

animal-individual or environmental risk factors in the disease course. Among others, bacterial

57

invasion is favored by interdigital skin damage caused by trauma or environmental conditions

58

such as humid and wet pastures (14). Unusually mild and wet weather conditions contribute

59

to the persistence of the bacteria in the environment (1,15).

60

Due to an absence of long-term immunity, reinfections and clinical relapses are frequent in

61

sheep (16). Healthy carriers are known to occur in sheep, cattle and goats (10,11,13,17) and

62

the bacteria can survive up to two weeks in the environment (10). Virulent isolates may

63

persist up to 10 months on bovine feet after co-grazing with sheep (11). Furthermore, a

64

single grazing season without contact with sheep is insufficient to eliminate all pathogenic

65

isolates from cattle feet (11). Thus, D. nodosus may be maintained in domestic ruminants

66

even in the absence of clinical disease.

67

In the Swiss Alps, and to a lesser extent in the Jura Mountains, transhumance-grazing is a

68

common practice and interactions between wild and domestic ruminants regularly occur on

69

summer grazing pastures (18–20). Pastures are often shared not only among cattle, sheep,

70

goats and South American camelids (Lama glama and Vigucna pacos) (21), but also with

71

indigenous free-ranging wild ruminants such as ibex (Capra ibex ibex), chamois (Rupicapra

72

rupicapra), red deer (Cervus elaphus) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) (20). All of them

73

represent potential hosts of D. nodosus and may play a role in pathogen maintenance and

74

spread. Based on the widespread occurrence of the disease in sheep and its sporadic

75

character in ibex and mufflon, it has been postulated that sheep are the source of infection

76

for wildlife, with transmission occurring on alpine pastures during the summer grazing season

77

(1).

78

Currently, countrywide prevalence estimations for D. nodosus are available only for potential

79

domestic hosts (13), while information on wildlife is virtually nonexistent. Importantly, further

80

insight in the processes governing the epidemiology of D. nodosus infections in wild and

81

domestic ruminants and into the infection dynamics at the wildlife-livestock interface are

82

needed to propose appropriate disease prevention and management measures in both

83

domestic and wild animals. For this purpose, it is crucial that data obtained on wildlife and

84

domestic animals can be directly compared (22), which requires the use of harmonized

85

methods, from the sampling strategy to laboratory analyses (23). Therefore, a nationwide

86

survey on infections with D. nodosus in free-ranging ungulates was conducted, following the

87

same study design and methodology as a parallel study in domestic livestock and South-

88

American camelids in Switzerland (13).

89

The aim was to estimate the prevalence of D. nodosus infections, distinguishing between

90

benign and virulent strains, in four species of indigenous wild ruminants during a two-year

91

period (2017-18) in all of Switzerland. We hypothesized that wild ungulates do not maintain D.

Material & Methods

97

Ethics statement

98

This study did not involve purposeful killing of animals. All samples originated from dead

99

wildlife legally hunted during hunting seasons, found dead, or legally shot because of severe

100

debilitation. According to the Swiss legislation (992.0 hunting law and 455 animal protection

101

law, including the legislation on animal experiments; www.admin.ch), no ethical approval or

102

permit for carcass /sample collection or animal experimentation was required.

103
104

Study area, species of interest, study design and sampling strategy

105

The study area comprised the whole territory of Switzerland (41,285 km2), which consists of three

106

main bioregions: the Jura Mountains (a limestone mountain chain with an elevation up to 1,679m

107

that separates the Alps to the southwest and forms an arc to the northeast), the Midlands

108

(characterized by a low altitude and a high human population density), and the Alps (having the

109

highest elevation up to 4,632m above sea level, which creates a climate wall separating the south

110

from central Europe). Species of interest were indigenous free-ranging wild ruminants including roe

111

deer, red deer, chamois and ibex. Deer species are mostly found below the timberline - roe deer

112

mainly in the foothill zone and red deer in the mountain zone; chamois live between the subalpine

113

and alpine zone; and ibex above the timberline.

114

The study was based on a cross-sectional convenient sampling strategy with the aim of estimating a

115

nationwide prevalence of D. nodosus infections on animal level in each of the four wild ruminant

116

species. Sampling was carried out from August 2017 to December 2018, with most samples collected

117

during the hunting seasons (i.e. August-December) of 2017 and 2018.

118

Sample size was calculated for each species separately, assuming simple random sampling. The free

119

online tool by AusVet Animal Health Services (http://epitools.auvet.com) was used for the

120

calculation, and in there, the method for the estimation of true prevalence using imperfect

121

diagnostic test characteristics was applied. For all species the design prevalence was set at 50%

122

because no prior information on prevalence of infection was available. The precision was set at 5%

123

and the level of confidence at 95%. The following estimated population sizes were used for the

124

sample size calculation (24): roe deer (113,000), red deer (28,500), chamois (91,500) and ibex

125

(15,500). Diagnostic test characteristics (qPCR) were estimated to a mean sensitivity of 93.8% and a

126

specificity of 98.3% (25). We aimed to sample 440-451 animals per species over two years, i.e. 1,786

127

individuals in total, distributed across the country and local political borders (cantons), according to

128

species occurrence and hunting plans.

129
130

Sample collection and animals

131

Sampling was mainly done by professional game wardens and hunters and in a few cases by the first

132

and the second author. Sampling kits included one SV Lysis buffer (4 M guanindinethiocyanate, 0.01

133

M Tris-HL, β-mercaptoethanol) in a tube with a screw-on lid, a cotton swab, a pair of latex gloves and

134

a data sheet to record biological data of the animal sampled (sex, age, geographical origin, body

135

condition) and the presence of foot lesions. Documentation of foot lesions were recorded for each

136

foot separately, including lesions in the interdigital space, the hooves and the carpal area based on

137

the most common lesions that are used in footrot scoring systems (26). If lesions were present, the

138

sample submitters were asked to submit the affected feet in addition to the swabs.

139

The study participants were also asked to report observed interspecies interactions involving both

140

wild and domestic species within a radius of 5 km around the sampling location. This distance was

141

roughly estimated considering the home range size of the investigated species (27,28). Four

142

categories of contacts were used as previously described (20): physical contact; encounter of less

143

than 50 m distance between animals; encounters of more than 50 m; and non-simultaneous

144

occupation of the same area. These categories were not relevant for D. nodosus transmission but

145

corresponded to those used in earlier studies and helped specifying the notion of interaction for the

146

respondents. Each data sheet included two tables, one for contacts among wild ruminants and the

147

other one for contacts between wild and domestic ungulates. For each type of contact, the frequency

148

of observation was recorded as follows: 0) never, 1) no more than once a year, 2) more than once a

149

year.

150

All sampling kits were sent to the cantonal hunting authorities, which subsequently distributed the

151

material to game wardens or hunters who then collected the samples in the field from hunted game.

152

Animals that were sent as routine diagnostic cases (without footrot lesions) to the Centre for Fish

153

and Wildlife Health (FIWI, University of Bern) for post-mortem examination were also sampled for

154

this study (N = 54).

155

A four-feet sample was taken from each animal, i.e. the interdigital space of each of the four feet of

156

each animal was sampled with the same cotton swab (2 mm 15 cm, Heinz Herenz, Medizinalbedarf

157

GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). Each clean quarter of the swab was used for each foot as previously

158

described (17), i.e. there was one swab per animal for laboratory analysis.

159

Immediately after swabbing the feet, each swab was immersed for at least 1 min in a tube containing

160

SV lysis buffer with a hermetic lid. This procedure allowed transportation and storage without

161

cooling until analysis (9).

162

In total 1,821 samples were taken, of which 91.4% (N = 1,664) by game wardens/hunters; 4.5% (N =

163

83) by field biologists; 3.3% (N = 60) by veterinarians (FIWI) and for 0.7% (N = 14) of the samples the

164

profession of the sampler was not given. The feet of five ibex, one red deer, three chamois and two

165

roe deer with presumptive footrot lesions were sent to the FIWI for macroscopic examination. All 26

166

cantons contributed to the achieved sample number. Thirty-seven point seven percent of the

167

samples (N = 686) were received in 2017 and 62.3% (N = 1135) in 2018.

168

There were 961 males, 807 females and 53 animals without sex information. We used three age

169

categories for the age estimation: juvenile (< 1 year, N=167), yearling (1-<2 year; N=245) and adult (≥

170

2 years, N=1,335). Age estimation was based on acquired knowledge of the sample submitters during

171

their formal training (hunters and professional game wardens). For roe deer and red deer this was

172

based on the tooth replacement and wear, while for ibex and chamois it was based on the growth

173

rings of the horns (29). No age information was provided for 74 animals.

174
175

Laboratory analysis

176

All collected samples were tested for the presence of benign or/and virulent strains of D. nodosus by

177

PCR (9). Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was extracted from the buffer solution by an automated

178

method using a KingFisherTM Duo Prime purification automat. A competitive real-time PCR was

179

performed in all samples, which allows the simultaneous detection of the virulent and benign strains

180

of D. nodosus by distinguishing the extracellular protease AprV2 found in the more virulent strains

181

from the subtly different protease AprB2 that is found in strains associated with benign disease signs

182

in sheep (9). Amplification was done in a 7500 Real-Time PCR system with cycle conditions of 2 min

183

at 50° C, 10 min at 95° C followed by 40 cycles of 15s at 95°C and 1 min at 60° C. Samples that

184

showed no fluorescent signal were considered negative; samples showing a positive fluorescent

185

signal for either strain were classified as positive. Results were then analyzed using the Sequence

186

Detector 7500.

187
188

Data management and statistical analysis

189

Data handling, validating, cleaning and coding were done in MS Excel spreadsheets followed by

190

transfer to R software version 3.5.1. (https://cran.r-project.org) for all statistical analyses. Apparent

191

and true prevalence were calculated using the “epi.prev” function of the package “epiR” considering

192

imperfect test characteristics, with a test sensitivity of 93.8% and test specificity of 98.3% (25) and a

193

confidence interval of 95%. The function calculates the true prevalence (TP) from the apparent

prevalence (AP) using the Rogan-Gladen estimator, based in the formula

195

𝑇𝑃 = ( 𝐴𝑃 + 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦 – 1 )/( 𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦 + 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦 – 1 ) (30).

196

A risk factor analysis for presence of D. nodosus on wild animal feet was performed with the PCR

197

status of the animals (positive or negative) as dependent variable and potential risk factors as

198

independent variables. Because only one sample was positive for the virulent strain, the risk factor

199

analysis was performed for the benign strain only. Logistic regression models were used first in a

200

univariable analysis followed by a multivariable analysis. The two variables interactions with either

201

roe deer or with chamois, were tested using Fisher’s Exact Test because zero interactions were

202

observed for PCR-positive animals. Variables with p-values < 0.2 were further considered in the

203

multivariable analysis, where a manual backward elimination procedure was performed with a cut-

204

off level at p-value <0.05. To be able to compare the prevalence for the benign strain of D. nodosus in

205

sheep and cattle (domestic ungulate study; Ardüser et. al 2019) with the prevalence of infection for

206

the benign strain in all wild ungulates (all species pooled; this study), we used a logistic regression

207

model in a multivariable analysis with a cut-off level at a p-value <0.05.

208

All maps were generated with QGIS 2.18.16 Las Palmas (Free Software Foundation Inc., Boston, USA).

Detection of Dichelobacter nodosus

212

Out of 1,821 sampled animals (Figure 1), 37 were found positive for D. nodosus (Figure 2). The

213

virulent strain was only found in one animal, an adult male ibex with severe disease signs. The benign

214

strain was found in 36 animals, including 31 red deer (20 males and 11 females; 8 juveniles, 5

215

yearlings, 17 adults, and 1 animal of unknown age), one roe deer (yearling female), one Alpine

216

chamois (adult male) and three Alpine ibex (all adult males). The estimated apparent prevalence for

217

the benign and virulent strains by species is given in Table 1a. Due to the low prevalence of D.

218

nodosus per species, the true prevalence (TP) could only be calculated for red deer (TP= 6.08% CI=3.5

219

– 9.3).

Four of the 31 (12.9%) red deer positive for the benign strain of D. nodosus were reported by

250

the sample submitters as having foot lesions. Two of them presented with lesions that

251

consisted in overgrown hooves, one of which concerned the lateral digits only, without

252

noticeable interdigital inflammation (i.e. no signs suggestive of footrot). In the other two red

253

deer, an interdigital grey malodorous exudate and rotting of the sole of one of the forelimbs

254

was reported. However, these observations could not be confirmed as neither photographs

255

nor any of the affected feet were submitted with the samples. One ibex positive for the

256

benign strain presented severe footrot lesions in the hind feet (Figure 3). All other animals

257

positive for the benign strain did not show any sign of disease (including two ibex).

258

The ibex with the virulent strain of D. nodosus showed severe footrot lesions in the front feet

259

(Figure 3), including a severe ulcerative interdigital pododermatitis with greyish discoloration

260

associated with an unpleasant odor, and severely multifocally fissured and overgrown

261

hooves. The severity of the lesions were similar in the two ibex infected with the benign and

262

the virulent strain, respectively.

Interspecies interactions

270

In total, 68% (N = 1236) of the sample submitters answered the questions listed on the data sheet

271

regarding interspecies interactions in their sampling area, either partially (58%) or fully (10%). Data

272

on reported proximity among species are summarized in Figure 4.

273

Encounters with both wildlife and domestic species were reported for all four investigated species in

274

all possible categories. Encounters of <50m, >50m and the non-simultaneous occupation of the same

275

pasture were reported more frequently with cattle and sheep than with goats and South American

276

camelids.

277

For ibex and chamois more specifically, about a third of the respondents reported encounters of

278

<50m and >50m with sheep as well as with cattle in ibex. Regarding chamois only, half of the

279

respondents reported encounters of <50m and >50m with cattle. As for the non-simultaneous

280

occupation of pastures, 11% of the respondents mentioned the use of pastures in wildlife habitat by

281

cattle and 8% by sheep. Physical contact between ibex and domestic livestock was not frequent and

282

reported mainly with small domestic ruminants (8% of the respondents). For chamois, a similar

283

percentage of physical contact was reported with small domestic ruminants (9%) and cattle (8%). As

284

concerns red deer, encounters of <50m (25%) and >50m (24%) were observed with cattle, and 4% of

285

the respondents even reported physical contact between the two species. Regarding roe deer,

286

patterns of encounters of <50m (23%) and >50m (14%) with cattle were similar to the observed

287

interactions that were reported for red deer. The non-simultaneous occupation of the same pasture

288

by deer and domestic ungulates was reported more frequently with cattle (red deer: 13%; roe deer:

289

6%) than with the other three domestic species.

290

Considering wild species only, interspecific interactions were reported mainly within the same

291

taxonomic family, i.e. among caprids (ibex and chamois) and among cervids (roe deer and red deer).

292

Interactions between red deer and chamois were also frequently reported and occasionally included

293

physical contacts (5% of the respondents). By contrast, only a few interactions between ibex and

294

cervids were reported, even though rare physical contacts between ibex and red deer (2%) were

295

documented.

296

Focusing on positive samples, 83% of the submitters of the 28 red deer and the single roe deer

297

samples positive for the benign strain of D. nodosus reported having observed direct or indirect

298

contacts with deer and cattle in the sampling area. Regarding the single positive chamois, contacts

299

among all wild and domestic species except domestic goats were reported to have been observed in

300

the sampling area. As concerns the four positive ibex, interspecies interactions were recorded only in

301

the sampling area of two of them (both positive for the benign strain but without lesions), with all

Analysis of risk factors for infection with D. nodosus

313

For the benign strain, univariable analysis indicated that the variables sex (male vs female), age (adult

314

vs yearling and juvenile), species (ibex vs red deer, chamois and roe deer), the presence of foot

315

lesions (presence vs absence) and interspecies interactions in the sampling area (report vs no report)

316

were associated for some levels with an infection of benign D. nodosus considering the threshold of p

317

= 0.2 (Table 2).

348

In this study, the prevalence of D. nodosus infections in wild ungulates in Switzerland was assessed

349

for the first time, more specifically in all four indigenous wild ruminant species. These results provide

350

a baseline necessary for the planning of a nationwide footrot control program in domestic livestock

351

in Switzerland. Although the number of investigated animals was too low to provide strong data on a

352

local level (e.g. cantonal), the sample size fulfilled the criteria for prevalence estimation per species

353

on a country level. The occurrence of interspecies interactions among wild and domestic ruminants

354

in an Alpine environment was additionally documented. Importantly, the study was conducted in

355

parallel to a nationwide survey on infections with D. nodosus in possibly susceptible domestic

356

livestock species The comparison of these data together with the reported interspecies interactions

357

is of crucial importance in providing information on disease dynamics at the wildlife-livestock

358

interface. (31).

359
360

Dichelobacter nodosus-associated lesions

361

Two adult male Alpine ibex, the one infected with the benign and the other with the virulent strain,

362

showed severe lesions consistent with footrot. These findings are in line with previous reports

363

documenting that D. nodosus infections with both the benign and the virulent strain can be

364

associated with severe foot lesions in Alpine ibex that are comparable to typical lesions of footrot in

365

sheep (1,4). The classification into benign and virulent strains was developed in the framework of a

366

study conducted in sheep and may only be applicable to sheep (9,32). The occurrence of severe

367

lesions associated with both strains in ibex but not in other wild and domestic species suggest the

368

existence of a species-specific difference in disease susceptibility, as it occurs for other pathogens

369

such as Mycoplasma conjunctivae in wild (with disease signs) vs domestic Caprinae (without signs)

370

and Brucella abortus in North American elk (Cervus canadensis) and Bison (Bison bison) (with signs)

371

vs cattle (without signs) (4,33–35). As for the other two Alpine ibex that harbored the benign strain

372

without foot lesions, it cannot be ruled out that they may have been in an early stage of the

373

infection, before clinical disease signs developed. Nevertheless, it is not known whether infection

374

with the benign strain requires the contribution of other factors (e.g. severe traumatic foot lesions,

375

reduced fitness of the animal, co-infection with other microorganisms) for lesions to develop.

376

Two red deer with reported foot lesions tested positive for the benign strain of D. nodosus. Whether

377

these lesions were footrot-like could not be confirmed because neither the affected feet nor

378

photographs were submitted for veterinary evaluation. However, D. nodosus has been already

379

isolated from sole ulcers in farmed red deer in New Zealand (35). Although strain differentiation was

380

not performed, it is likely that it was the benign type based on proteolytic effects observed in

381

bacterial culture and because subsequent experimental infection of sheep resulted in the

382

development of mild footrot lesions only. Infectious hoof diseases with similar clinical findings have

383

been reported in cattle and free-ranging reindeer (36–38) involving pathogens such as Fusobacterium

384

necrophorum, as well as Treponema sp. in cattle. Infection with Treponema sp. was also recently

385

shown to be associated with a dramatic outbreak of severe foot lesions including osteomyelitis in

386

free-ranging North American elk (Cervus canadensis) (39,40). Therefore, since all samples of the

387

present study were tested via qPCR for the presence of D. nodosus only, we cannot exclude that

388

other pathogens causing foot disease in domestic and wild ruminants may have been involved in the

389

development of the observed lesions.

390

The presence of foot lesions was identified as a factor associated with the infection of benign D.

391

nodosus. Obviously, the reported lesions were rather the consequence of the infection than a risk

392

factor. This result from the risk factor analysis is also questionable because these lesions were only

393

confirmed as footrot-like in the ibex.

394
395

Interspecies interactions

396

Only 68% of the respondents answered (partially or fully) the questions regarding interspecies

397

interactions on the data sheet. Additionally, considering that wildlife is most often active at dawn or

398

dusk (6,41,42) it is therefore possible that the frequency and intensity of reported interactions was

399

underestimated. Furthermore, because these data rely on reports of numerous voluntary

400

participants, they may be biased in other ways. Mainly, the delivered information relies on

401

memorized events of the participants and may have resulted in a lack of reporting or in misreporting.

402

Nevertheless, this method represents the only feasible and efficient way of recruiting such data on a

403

large geographical scale, and reported interspecies interactions at the wildlife/domestic animal

404

interface were in agreement with previous findings (19,20). Most frequent interactions between wild

405

and domestic ungulates involved cattle or sheep. Such data are useful to understand the

406

epidemiology of infectious diseases in natural habitats, which are shared during certain periods by

407

multiple species, wild and domestic.

408
409

Identifying maintenance hosts

410

The present study revealed a very low prevalence of infection in all considered wild ungulate species.

411

All prevalence calculated for wild species were significantly lower than those reported in both cattle

412

(benign strain) and sheep (benign and virulent strain)(13). There is no given threshold of prevalence

413

to conclude that a pathogen is maintained in a population or not, pathogen persistence in a

414

population has been demonstrated to rely on the critical community size of a given population

415

considering that the number of susceptible individuals does not drop under a certain threshold (43).

416

Although in smaller wildlife populations it has been previously reported that some infections agents

417

can persist with low incidences, provided that pathogens can circulate between subpopulations of

418

several species and recurrent interspecific transmission occurs (33,44). However, in the case of D.

419

nodosus the difference in prevalence between wild and domestic ungulates is striking. Additional

420

points to consider are: 1) the endemic disease status of the Swiss sheep population (3,13); 2) the

421

recently gained knowledge on the widespread occurrence of D. nodosus infection in asymptomatic

422

livestock in Switzerland (88% of cattle positive with the benign strain)(3,13); 3) the much larger sizes

423

of cattle and sheep populations compared to wild ungulate populations (24,45); 4) the more

424

continuous distribution of domestic than wild animals over the country (ibex in particular occur in

425

fairly isolated colonies(24,40); 5) the more frequent and intense intraspecific contacts among

20

426

domestic animals and mixing of herds (grazing, shows, markets) and movements throughout the

427

country (alpine summering, commercial exchanges); 6) the absence of healthy carriers for the

428

virulent strain in wild ungulates; and 7) the reported interspecies interactions at the domestic

429

animal/wildlife interface regarding mainly sheep and cattle. Therefore taking into consideration the

430

previously mentioned points together with the comparison of the domestic ungulate study, our

431

results suggest that sheep are maintenance hosts for both virulent and benign D. nodosus and cattle

432

for the benign strain only. Thus, both likely represent the main source of infection for domestic and

433

wild ungulates. Regarding cattle, the prevalence of infection with the benign strain is in agreement

434

with reports from Norway and Australia (11,46). By contrast, our results suggest that wild ruminants

435

are occasional spillover hosts without epidemiological significance. Nevertheless, the sample size

436

used in this study does not allow to exclude potential differences in prevalence of infection on a local

437

level. For example, the occurrence of previous outbreaks of footrot in wildlife, wildlife population

438

management and densities, frequency and intensity of interspecific interactions on summer pastures

439

and livestock practices such as already existing sanitation programs (virulent strain) are all factors

440

that likely vary among regions.

441

Regarding the benign strain, infections were detected in at least one animal per wild ungulate

442

species, with red deer showing the highest prevalence of infection (TP 6.08%). Risk factor analysis

443

indicated that red deer are at a significantly higher risk of being infected with benign D. nodosus than

444

ibex. This is in line with the fact that interspecies interactions involving red deer are most commonly

445

observed with cattle (this study; 20) and that the prevalence of benign D. nodosus is highest in cattle

446

(AP 83.3%; 13). It is therefore most likely that cattle act as source of infection for susceptible wild

447

ungulates, as previously suspected (4). Since the upcoming nationwide control program will only

448

focus on virulent D. nodosus in sheep, it is unclear whether it will influence the prevalence of benign

449

D. nodosus in any species, i.e. the control program is not expected to significantly decrease the risk of

450

footrot outbreaks caused by the benign strain of D. nodosus in ibex populations in the future.

452

Conclusion

453

This study delivers crucial information for the design of the upcoming nationwide control program of

454

virulent D. nodosus in sheep. Furthermore, the simultaneous, harmonized investigation of both wild

455

and domestic species contributes to a better understanding of the epidemiology of footrot in

456

Switzerland and will help targeting disease prevention measures, as it revealed that combatting the

457

virulent strain does not necessitate to involve wildlife . The obtained data suggest that infections in

458

wild ruminants are sporadic despite the high prevalence's of infection in sheep and cattle and despite

459

the widespread occurrence of interactions between wildlife and livestock. Overall, wildlife seems to

460

be an incidental spillover host and not a maintenance host that may infect healthy sheep or re-infect

461

sanitized herds. Since footrot lesions in ibex were also associated with the benign strain and the

462

upcoming control program will only focus on the virulent strain in sheep, this program is not

463

expected to influence disease occurrence in ibex in the future, especially when taking into

464

consideration the high prevalence of benign D. nodosus in the Swiss cattle population. Further

465

research is needed to evaluate the impact of footrot in ibex and whether it would be appropriate to

466

take disease management actions to prevent outbreaks.
