Abstract:

15

To understand brain functions, it is important to observe directly how multiple neural circuits are

16

performing in living brains. However, due to tissue opaqueness, observable depth and

17

spatiotemporal resolution are severely degraded in vivo. Here, we propose an optical brain clearing

18

method for in vivo fluorescence microscopy, termed MAGICAL (Magical Additive Glycerol

19

Improves Clear Alive Luminance). MAGICAL enabled two-photon microscopy to capture vivid

20

images with fast speed, at cortical layer V and hippocampal CA1 in vivo. Moreover, MAGICAL

21

promoted conventional confocal microscopy to visualize finer neuronal structures including

22

synaptic boutons and spines in unprecedented deep regions, without intensive illumination leading

23

to phototoxic effects. Fluorescence Emission Spectrum Transmissive Analysis (FESTA) showed

24

that MAGICAL improved in vivo transmittance of shorter wavelength light, which is vulnerable to

25

optical scattering thus unsuited for in vivo microscopy. These results suggest that MAGICAL

26

would transparentize living brains via scattering reduction.

Main Text:

30

How do neurons work together for brain functions in living animals? In the brain, numerous

31

neurons connect to each other three-dimensionally (3D) to form neural circuits underlying brain

32

functions. Functional characteristics of neural circuits depend on neuronal activity and synaptic

33

connectivity, both of which are reflected in fine sculptural distinctions in many cases1-3. Multiple

34

neural circuits are associated with each other as a neural network, and are executed for rapid

35

processing simultaneously, to respond to various situations and their transitions4. Therefore, to

36

understand brain functions, in vivo imaging techniques are required to observe intact neural circuits

37

extended into deep regions, at high spatiotemporal resolution.

38

Confocal microscopy and two-photon microscopy can provide 3D and time-lapse images by

39

sequential optical sectioning in thick specimens without mechanical destruction5,6. However, it is

40

difficult for the fluorescence microscopy, especially to confocal microscopy, to achieve sufficiently

41

deep, fine, and fast imaging in vivo, because tissue opaqueness disturbs and attenuates both

42

excitation lights and fluorescence signals. A simple but practical technique to overcome the

43

opaqueness is high-intensity illumination by using high-power excitation laser, but it has a risk of

44

causing invasive phototoxic problems via reactive oxygen species production. Thus, new strategies

45

are needed to overcome tissue opaqueness for in vivo imaging.

46

Recently, many optical clearing methods were reported for fluorescence microscopy in fixed

47

organs including brains7-13. These clearing methods enable confocal microscopy to achieve fine and

48

deeper imaging, and have brought a paradigm shift in connectome analysis, to create connection

49

maps over comprehensive neural networks. However, these clearing methods need

50

non-physiological procedures to transparentize fixed organs, thus are especially inapplicable to

51

living brains for in vivo fluorescence microscopy. Here, we propose a new strategy for

52

brain-clearing in in vivo microscopy. Our clearing method is simply based on glycerol

53

administration via drinking water, so we named it MAGICAL (Magical Additive Glycerol

54

Improves Clear Alive Luminance).

Results:

Enhanced fluorescence signals in vivo.

59

For in vivo brain imaging with fluorescence microscopy, the conventional method involves

60

open-skull surgery. It consists of making a cranial window, in which the light-scattering skull bone

61

is replaced by a clear cover glass, and is conceived as a key step affecting the quality of images in

62

day-to-day experiments14. The cranial window, and probably the brain itself, lose transparency

63

easily, which may be caused by unsuitable surgical techniques, leading to bleeding and damage

64

inside/outside the brain, and by unknown factors related with the recovery process. Thus, a smaller

65

cranial window is biologically preferred to avoid injuring blood vessels and to minimize contact

66

between the brain surface and the surgical materials14. However, a larger cranial window is

67

optically preferred to collect even light emitted from a focal point at wide radiation angles, by

68

using a high-numerical-aperture (NA) lens which governs spatial resolution and fluorescence

69

intensity in imaging. Therefore, we tried to improve in vivo microscopy by reducing the detrimental

70

effects of open-skull surgery. We focused on glycerol oral administration, which is known to

71

suppress cerebral edema in neurosurgical patients and suggested to supply energy to ischemic

72

neurons in cerebral stroke15-22.

73

First, we examined whether oral administration of glycerol improves cerebral fluorescence

74

images of in vivo two-photon microscopy. To visualize neural circuits, we used adult H-line mice

75

(Thy1-EYFP-H), which express Enhanced Yellow Fluorescent Protein (EYFP) in some of the

76

pyramidal neurons. To avoid selection bias under uneven EYFP expression, the imaging area was

77

selected according to the xy position where the hippocampus was observable at the most shallow

78

depth. We captured 3D stacks as z-series of xy-images, using a two-photon microscope with

79

960-nm Ti:Sapphire laser light. The xy-images were acquired as 512 × 512 pixels at 1 frame per

80

sec (fps), 2.2 µsec per pixel, which is the maximum speed in this condition.

81

The images of the cortical layer V (CxLV) neurons were captured with 3-µm z-step size

82

(Supplementary Movie 1) and were reconstructed with depth color-coded maximum intensity

83

projection (DccMIP). In mice without glycerol administration (control), fluorescence images

84

showed the pyramidal neuron cell bodies with basal dendrites, but the density was poor as a

85

consequence of weak capture conditions (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Movie 1). In contrast, in mice

86

with 5 % (w/v) glycerol administration (MAGICAL), bright fluorescence images showed many cell

87

bodies and basal dendrites with high density (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Movie 1).

88

In CxLV images at three different depths (Supplementary Fig. 1), fluorescence intensity

89

distribution (FID) indicated that signals tended to increase with MAGICAL (Supplementary Fig.

90

2). However, it was not simple to summarize the FIDs for statistical analysis. The FIDs showed

91

large individual differences within each treatment group, obscuring differences between the groups.

92

Moreover, the FIDs had non-normal distributions extending beyond the detector’s dynamic range.

93

To overcome these problems, we evaluated fluorescence intensities of pixels (FIPs) in the image

94

stacks, by using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM). The FIPs were randomly selected

95

from the stack and collected as samples, if not saturation or zero intensity, and were used as a

96

response variable in the GLMM with a Gamma error distribution and a log link function. In the

97

GLMM, “Treatment” (MAGICAL or control) and “Depth” (3 levels) were assigned as fixed effects,

98

and “Mouse” was assigned as a random effect for intercepts and “Depth” slopes. The GLMM

99

comprised 929,331 FIPs in 78 image stacks, extracted from 3 depths of 26 mice under 2 treatments

100

(R2GLMM(m): 0.0147, R2GLMM(c): 0.200, Supplementary Table 1a). In estimation for fixed effects, the

101

GLMM indicated that MAGICAL enhanced FIPs in the CxLV images (Fig. 1b–c; p < 0.001 at

102

each “Depth” level by pairwise comparison). These signal enhancements mean that MAGICAL can

103

overcome tissue opaqueness enough to improve in vivo imaging.

104
105
106

In vivo two-photon deep imaging with fast speed.
To achieve in vivo imaging in deeper regions, the most effective strategy is to use much

107

longer-wavelength, less scattered, near-infrared light at high power for two-photon excitation23,24.

108

Recently, hippocampal granule cells in the dentate gyrus were visualized at 1.5-mm depth in adult

109

mice by using a 1064 nm laser-diode light, in the most successful surgery without bleeding24.

110

Furthermore, hippocampal CA1 (HpCA1) neurons can be visualized at 1.0-mm depth in adult mice,

111

by using 1000 nm Ti:Sapphire laser light24. However, despite the advantage of longer-wavelength

112

strategy, fluorescence acquisitions must collect shorter visible light, attenuated more easily by

113

scattering and absorption in tissues depending on return distance. Indeed, both deep imaging

114

techniques require scanning neurons at 1/16 or less fps, which is extremely slow, to visualize

115

neural activity and to overcome image distortions caused by heartbeats. So, as a touchstone of in

116

vivo deep imaging, we examined whether MAGICAL improves adult HpCA1 images at fast

117

scanning.

118

By using 960 nm Ti:Sapphire laser light, HpCA1 images approximately at 1.0-mm depth were

119

captured as 3D stacks, having xy-images (512 × 512 pixels) with 1 fps fast speed. In control mice,

120

fluorescence images showed some dim cell bodies of pyramidal neurons (Fig. 2a, Supplementary

121

Fig. 3). In contrast, in MAGICAL mice, fluorescence images showed many cell bodies of

122

pyramidal neurons, some of which were clearly visualized with their partial process of apical

123

dendrite (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 3).

124

In HpCA1 images captured from three different depths ± 3 µm (Supplementary Fig. 4), FIDs

125

were shifted to bright side with MAGICAL (Supplementary Fig. 5). GLMM at HpCA1 was

126

comprised with 957,264 FIPs in 78 image stacks extracted 3 depths from 26 mice under 2

127

treatments (R2GLMM(m): 0.0714, R2GLMM(c): 0.190, Supplementary Table 1b). In estimation for fixed

128

effects, the GLMM indicated that MAGICAL also enhanced FIPs in the HpCA1 images, despite

129

long traversing from deep regions (Fig. 2b–c; p < 0.001 at each “Depth” level by pairwise

130

comparison). These results suggest that MAGICAL would promote deep imaging as a practical

131

method to visualize fast activity on mature neural circuits in adult mice.

132
133

In vivo confocal fine imaging with single-photon excitation at deeper regions.

134

Despite its superior spatial resolution, confocal microscopy is less suitable for in vivo imaging

135

than two-photon microscopy, because its shorter-wavelength excitation has an inferior penetration

136

depth and a higher risk for phototoxic effects. Moreover, confocal microscopy cannot efficiently

137

collect fluorescence signals due to a confocal aperture, which excludes most of the signals scattered

138

by the tissue but is needed to remove extrafocal light causing image blur. Therefore, confocal

139

microscopy is vulnerable to tissue opaqueness, especially optical scattering. In general, in vivo

140

confocal microscopy is hardly able to visualize fine neural fibers below 50-µm depth, which poses

141

a dilemma between clear visualization and phototoxicity reduction25. The abovementioned effects

142

of MAGICAL on in vivo two-photon imaging, suggest that it may overcome that dilemma.

143

Thus, we examined to what extent MAGICAL enables in vivo confocal microscopy to visualize

144

neural fibers at deeper regions. We captured 3D stack images of cortical layer I (CxLI) at 50 ± 5,

145

100 ± 5, and 150 ± 5 µm depth in H-line mice, by using a confocal microscope with 488-nm laser

146

light (CM image) and a two-photon microscope with 960-nm (2PM image as a reference). The 3D

147

stack images comprise 1-µm-step z-series of xy-images, acquired as 512 × 512 pixels at 1 fps. In

148

control mice, dim CM images at 100 and 150 µm depth were hardly able to visualize fine neural

149

fibers except for thick shafts of apical dendrites which extend along the z-axis direction (Fig. 3a,

150

Supplementary Fig. 6). However, in MAGICAL mice, bright CM images even at 100 and 150 µm

151

depth showed a lot of thin neuronal processes extending in the xy-plane across the apical dendrite

152

shaft (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 6).

153

We quantified similarities between CM images and 2PM reference images at same CxLI areas,

154

by using the intersection probability between Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features

155

extracted from each image. In the HOG comparison, CM images with MAGICAL retained more

156

similarity to 2PM reference images at deeper regions (Fig. 3b–d, p = 0.0484 at 100 µm depth, p =

157

0.0420 at 150 µm depth, in permuted Brunner-Munzel test, n = 6 in control mice, n = 7 in

158

MAGICAL mice). These results show that MAGICAL improves the observable depth at which in

159

vivo confocal imaging can visualize detailed features.

160

To evaluate visualization abilities of confocal microscopy with MAGICAL, we captured 3D

161

stack images with high-magnification at around 100 µm depth. In MAGICAL mice, the images

162

showed synaptic structures, such as dendritic spines and axonal boutons, clearly, and fine fibers

163

with less optical aberration along the z-axis (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. 7). Moreover, in vivo

164

confocal images with MAGICAL did not show remarkable bleaching or phototoxic effects, as

165

observed in time-lapse 3D stack imaging at 5-min intervals for 30 min (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig.

166

7). These data suggest that MAGICAL would provide a practical approach to observe deeper

167

regions with superior spatial resolution beyond the dilemma posed by confocal microscopy.

168
169
170

Evaluation of clearing ability by FESTA.
Fluorescence signal enhancement at several depths is one of the phenomena expected with

171

optical clearing. However, it remains unclear whether MAGICAL improves transparency inside

172

living brains. To address the question, we tried to evaluate in vivo transmittance at different

173

wavelengths through the brain.

174

In conventional transmissive analyses, a certified light source is needed on the other side of a

175

detector beyond a target, to calculate transmittance, i.e., the intensity ratio of transmissive light

176

through a target to incident light from the source. In this perspective, fluorescence probes do not

177

suit the light source for in vivo transmissive analysis, because original fluorescence intensity within

178

focal point depends on the amount of the fluorescence probes and intensity of transmitted

179

excitation light, both of which are unknown and uncontrollable inside living brains. However, a

180

fluorescence emission spectrum is physically certified as emission probability at wavelengths,

181

determined by energy levels and transition frequencies inherent in its molecule. Thus, to evaluate in

182

vivo transmittance, we developed a new analytical method, Fluorescence Emission Spectrum

183

Transmissive Analysis (FESTA), by using the emission spectrum as a scale independent of whole

184

fluorescence intensity.

185

As fluorescence resources of in vivo FESTA, artificial yellow-green (YG) beads (Fluoresbrite

186

YG Microspheres, Calibration Grade 1 µm; Polysciences) were injected into living mouse brains,

187

and then were scattered in small clusters with cerebrospinal fluid flow. We calculated spectral

188

intensity ratio of Cyan (458–511 nm) to Yellow (560–650 nm) light within in vivo images of the

189

bead clusters (Fig. 5a). In contrast to fluorescence intensity, the Cyan/Yellow ratio was

190

independent on both of amount of the fluorescence probes and two-photon excitation power

191

(Supplementary Fig. 8). However, the Cyan/Yellow ratio was different between depths

192

(Supplementary Fig. 8). Therefore, it is considered that the Cyan/Yellow ratio is proportional to a

193

ratio, comprising the emission probability (constant), detector sensitivity (fixed as constant), and

194

transmittance in the return path from inside the brain, for the Cyan and Yellow light.

195

To focus on internal transmittance in living brains, and to remove the constant factors, we

196

evaluated spectral transmission ratio (∆Cyan/Yellow) while the light returned from deeper regions

197

to 100 µm depth. The ∆Cyan/Yellow gradually decreased along the depth (Fig. 5b). It is, therefore,

198

reasonable to consider that the cyan transmittance is more likely to be decreased than the yellow

199

one because shorter wavelength light is more scattered depending on the optical path-length.

200

However, in MAGICAL, a decrease of ∆Cyan/Yellow was suppressed at deeper regions (p =

201

0.00159 in unpaired two-tailed Welch's t-test, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0.0551–0.174, t =

202

4.29, df = 10.0, Cohen’s d = 2.48, n = 6 mice in each group, at 600 µm depth). These results

203

suggest that MAGICAL improves in vivo transmittance especially of shorter wavelength light

204

susceptible to optical scattering. Thus, we conclude that MAGICAL exerts an optical clearing

205

ability to reduce scattering in living brains.

206
207

Discussion:

208
209

MAGICAL improved clear fluorescence signals, which would be enough to achieve faster

210

imaging at deeper regions, in vivo. The imaging speed is one of the most important factors for in

211

vivo observation. Fast imaging enables the visualization of not only instantaneous changes in neural

212

activity with high temporal resolution but also finer structures of neural circuits by overcoming

213

heartbeat-related trembles. In addition, fast imaging is required for enhancement of spatial

214

resolution per time unit and expansion of observable areas within limited experimental time.

215

Furthermore, fast imaging would be preferred to reduce phototoxic effects in vivo. Thus,

216

MAGICAL would be a fundamental method for in vivo imaging to observe extensive neural

217

circuits at high spatiotemporal resolution with less invasiveness.

218

Our results suggested that MAGICAL can transparentize living brains via scattering reduction.

219

This leads us to the question of how does MAGICAL suppress the optical scattering in living

220

brains? Generally, the major source of optical scattering in tissues is refractive index mismatches

221

between structural components (nd; approx. 1.5) and interstitial fluids (water, nd; 1.33). A

222

conventional optical clearing is achieved by increasing the refractive index of fluids with high

223

index reagents, including glycerol (nd; 1.47 at 100 %), which can infiltrate into tissues and/or

224

replace original fluids by itself, and as a result, reduce the mismatches. This clearing approach is

225

useful for in vivo imaging to penetrate into tough tissues, such as skin26 and skull27, where glycerol

226

immersion is tolerable even at high concentration keeping a high refractive index. However,

227

glycerol also causes hemolysis in vivo as a function of dose, concentration, and route of

228

administration15,28, indicating that the conventional technique using higher concentration glycerol is

229

less applicable for almost in vivo tissues. Moreover, MAGICAL achieves optical clearing of living

230

brains regardless of low concentration glycerol (5 %), which has almost the same refractive index

231

as water. Therefore, to explain optical clearing by MAGICAL, other mechanisms different from

232

conventional ones are needed.

233

MAGICAL was designed in reference to the medical treatment for cerebral edema and

234

ischemic stroke15-21. Cerebral edema may occur for various reasons: cerebral trauma and

235

inflammation allow the leak of serum proteins, drawing fluid into the brain due to the breakdown

236

of the blood-brain barrier29. Furthermore, ischemia and hypoxia cause cell swelling due to a

237

dysfunction of ion pumps caused by energy depletion29. The cerebral edema, in turn, reduces blood

238

flow (ischemia) as a consequence of intracranial hypertension, thereby deteriorating hypoxia.

239

Clinically, glycerol is commonly administrated to neurosurgery and stroke patients, in order to

240

reduce edema via dehydration, thus to decrease intracranial pressure (ICP), and to increase cerebral

241

blood flow16,17,19-21. From an optical point of view, light scattering is increased in living brains

242

under cerebral ischemia and hypoxia, experimentally induced by blood removal and nitrogen gas

243

inhalation, respectively30,31. The increased scattering is attributed to disturbances in

244

cellular/subcellular structures due to the energy depletion. In the case of in vivo microscopy, living

245

brains are exposed to loads, such as open-skull surgery, illumination for fluorescence excitation,

246

and slight hypoxia from anesthesia. These loads cause brain trauma and inflammation, which in

247

turn would trigger local edema, which, although not as severe as experimental ischemia and

248

hypoxia, is enough to increase scattering for shorter wavelength light. Altogether, MAGICAL

249

protects the living brains from edema and ischemia and thus would preserve the brain transparency.

250

What are the adverse effects of using MAGICAL for in vivo imaging? In toxicity tests, chronic

251

oral glycerol has been shown as safe for animals, when administered in dosages equal to or lower

252

than 9 g/kg-bw/day32,33. Thus, MAGICAL is considered as a non-invasive treatment, considering

253

that 4.5-ml of 5 % (w/v) glycerol is daily administered as drinking water to a mouse weighing

254

approximately 25-g. In the treatment of cerebral edema, glycerol administration does not show

255

severe ICP rebound, electrolyte imbalance, and toxic side effects16,17,20,21. In addition, glycerol

256

administration is expected to improve electroencephalogram and neurological status in ischemic

257

stroke patients17-19. Moreover, glycerol administration is also commonly used to reduce intraocular

258

pressure in glaucoma patients, without significant side effects suggestive of neurologic

259

dysfunction34. These results suggest that MAGICAL would less disturb fundamental mechanisms

260

executing brain functions. However, glycerol administration would improve energy metabolism in

261

ischemic brains19, indicating that glycerol can be a cue to trigger some neural activity. The extent to

262

which MAGICAL can modulate neural activity remains unclear, and thus probably should be

263

evaluated for each neural circuit of interest.

264

MAGICAL is the first candidate for the optical clearing method applicable to living brains,

265

easily improving in vivo microscopy without requiring any special skills or devices. Improved

266

transparency for shorter-wavelength light with MAGICAL, means to expand the usability of

267

various light sources, luminous probes, photosensitive caged compounds, and optogenetic tools for

268

in vivo imaging and optical manipulation. In other words, MAGICAL is an important contribution

269

toward for scientific advance, requiring a multi-laser/probe combination, such as the stimulated

270

emission depletion microscopy35, photo-stimulation techniques36, and multi-color imaging37.

271

Moreover, MAGICAL enables in vivo microscopy via the cranial window, to be combined with

272

other neurological methods that insert electrodes or glass capillaries. These classical methods have

273

been less compatible with in vivo microscopy due to an open-skull dogma that prohibits from

274

contacting the brain for clear imaging. However, MAGICAL’s clearing ability has been

275

demonstrated, despite after artificial beads injections in the FESTA. Thus, MAGICAL would

276

accelerate functional analysis for brain functions, only by oral administration of glycerol.

278

Methods:

279
280

No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. In Generalized Linear Mixed

281

Models (GLMMs), we used large sample sizes generally enough for modeling. For the Welch's

282

t-test, we confirmed that the t-test had adequate power, with a post-hoc test having effect size

283

(Cohen's d), p-value (< 0.01), and the sample size.

284

The experiments were not randomized. In vivo imaging must observe individual mice convergently,

285

not parallelly, for a long time. To reduce influence dependent on specific timing, the observation

286

order for each experimental group should be uniformly mixed. However, the sample size is

287

insufficient for randomization to ensure to equalize the order. Thus, we allocated mice to

288

experimental groups so as not to localize the order.

289

Investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and data analysis. To remove

290

observer bias during experiments, observation area was selected by previously defined criteria, as

291

described in "Methods, 'Fluorescence intensity analysis' section". Data collection and analysis were

292

automatically performed by software with fixed parameter setting or macro programs.

294

Animals. All experiments were conducted in accordance with the Animal Research Committee of

295

the Hokkaido University. The protocols were approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal

296

Experiments in the Hokkaido University (No. 10-0119). Adult transgenic mice (9 to 12 weeks old,

297

male) from Thy1-EYFP-H (H-line) were used for in vivo imaging of neurons. Adult

298

C57BL/6NCrSlc mice (10 to 22 weeks old, male; Japan SLC, Shizuoka, Japan) were used for the

299

FESTA with injected fluorescent beads. All mice were housed with food and drink ad libitum and

300

were maintained in a 12 h light-dark cycle (lights on from 8:00 to 20:00), with controlled

301

temperature (22 °C to 26 °C) and humidity (40 % to 60 %).

302
303

Glycerol administration. For MAGICAL mice, 5 % (w/v) glycerol (075-00616; Wako Pure

304

Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) was administered orally in the drinking water, ad libitum, from

2 weeks prior to open-skull surgery to the end of the experiment, except during operations and

306

observations. Control mice received only water.

307
308

Open-skull surgery. A cranial window was surgically created overlying the left cortex, according

309

to a previous protocol14,23, with minor modifications. Briefly, 45 mg/kg-bw minocycline (Nichi-Iko

310

Pharmaceutical, Toyama, Japan) were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) about 4 h before surgery, to

311

suppress bacterial infection and to protect neurons against microglial activation

312

(neuroinflammation). Anesthesia was induced with an i.p. injection of 60 mg/kg-bw pentobarbital

313

sodium (Somnopentyl; Kyoritsu Seiyaku Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), and was maintained with

314

isoflurane inhalation (0.5 % to 1.5 %). To limit inflammation, 2 mg/kg-bw dexamethasone

315

(Kyoritsu Seiyaku Corporation) was injected intramuscularly. Cranial bones were exposed, and

316

then the left parietal bone was circularly carved about 4.2 mm in diameter with a dental drill and

317

was removed gently. The exposed dura was washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to

318

remove blood cells. A 4.2-mm diameter round coverslip (Micro Cover GLASS, #1S, about 0.17

319

mm thickness; Matsunami Glass Industry, Osaka, Japan), previously coated with a biocompatible

320

polymer— Lipidure® (CM5206E; NOF Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), to prevent foreign-body

321

reactions, especially to blood clotting—was placed directly over the dura without extra pressure,

322

and was sealed on the bone edges with cyanoacrylate cement and dental adhesive resin cement

323

(Super-Bond C&B; Sun Medical Company, Shiga, Japan). To make the foundations for chamber

324

fixation, exposed cranial bones around the cranial window were partially coated with the adhesive

325

resin cement. A head chamber, which has a center hole to expose the cranial window, was secured

326

to the cranial bones with dental acrylic resin cement (Unifast III; GC Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). 5

327

mg/kg-bw carprofen (Rimadyl; Zoetis, Parsippany, NJ, USA) was injected i.p. to reduce

328

inflammation and pain. After surgery, the mouse was singly housed for recovery at least 3 hours

329

until observation.

331

Beads injection. The beads injection into the cortex was performed in an open-skull surgery, with

332

minor modifications before sealing with the coverslip, by using an oil filled glass micropipette

333

attached to a mechanically driven Hamilton microsyringe. The left parietal bone was elliptically

334

resected about 3.9-mm in the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis and about 2.7-mm in the medial-lateral

335

axis. A needle of the glass micropipette was inserted into the cortex at an angle of 54 degrees with

336

respect to the brain surface, and proceeded 0.9 mm towards the anterior direction along the A-P

337

axis, to reach about 0.72 mm depth. 1-µm YG beads (Fluoresbrite® YG Microspheres, Calibration

338

Grade 1 µm, #18860; Polysciences, Incorporated, Warrington, PA, USA) were diluted at 4.6 × 108

339

beads/mL with PBS, and were gradually injected into the needle trace in repeated steps, in which

340

the needle was withdrawn 0.3 mm and then was kept in place for 5 min. During and after the

341

injection, the exposed dura was washed with PBS to remove blood cells and to prevent drying.

342

After the surgery, the mouse was singly housed for recovery at least one day until observation.

343
344

Setup of in vivo imaging. All in vivo imaging sessions were conducted in mice anesthetized with

345

isoflurane inhalation23,24. The head chamber was mounted and glued to a customized adaptor stage,

346

which suspended the mouse body with a harness, to reduce adverse effects due to movements.

347

After setting under an upright microscope system, the adaptor stage was adjusted at a tilt angle,

348

referring to 1-µm diameter fluorescent beads scattered on the coverslip as a guide, so that the

349

cranial window was positioned horizontally, hence providing a suitable optical alignment. All in

350

vivo imaging sessions were performed under a microscope system (A1R MP+ Multiphoton

351

Confocal Microscope; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) controlled by NIS-Elements software (version

352

4.13.00; Nikon) with 12-bit dynamic range. Before in vivo imaging, z-position at the brain surface

353

was set as zero for absolute depth.

354
355

Two-photon microscopy. In vivo two-photon imaging was performed with a water immersion

356

objective (25× Ob., 1.10 NA) in PBS. The EYFP and the YG beads were excited by 960 nm and

357

900 nm, respectively, emitted from Ti:Sapphire laser (Mai Tai DeepSee; Newport Spectra-Physics,

358

Irvine, CA, USA). By using a Galvano scanner in one-directional mode, the xy-images in the 3D

359

stacks were acquired as 512 × 512 pixels at 1 frame per sec (fps), 2.2 µsec per pixel, which is

360

maximum speed in this condition. The 3D display was performed using the NIS-Elements

361

software.

362

To visualize the neural circuits, all the EYFP signals under 650-nm wavelength were collected

363

in a GaAsP type Non-Descanned Detector (GaAsP-NDD). The CxLV and HpCA1 images were

364

captured as 3D stacks with 3 µm z-step size. The depth of the CxLV was determined between 495

365

µm and 585 µm, where somas of CxLV pyramidal neurons were observed in every mouse. The

366

depth of the HpCA1 was slightly different for each mouse, thus the middle of stratum pyramidale,

367

approximately at 975 µm absolute depth, was set as the center depth of each HpCA1 stack. To

368

evaluate the brightness of the images, laser power (LP) under objective lens and detector sensitivity

369

(HV: high voltage) were fixed. The CxLV was captured with LP 66 mW (under 25× Ob.) and HV

370

30. The HpCA1 was captured with LP 200 mW (under 25× Ob.) and HV 30.

371

For the FESTA, fluorescence signals were split to multi-colors by dichroic mirrors (DM) in

372

front of the GaAsP-NDDs. The signals of YG beads were split by DM458, DM511, and DM560,

373

and then separately detected at 458–511 nm (Cyan) and at 560–650 nm (Yellow). To avoid optical

374

influence by injection trace, the FESTA applied to the beads clusters observable without crossing

375

the trace. The beads images were captured as 3D stacks with 0.25 µm z-step size at depth of

376

interest ± 1.0 µm (9 sections). The detector sensitivities were fixed: HV 1 on the Cyan channel and

377

HV 3 on the Yellow channel. The laser powers were adjusted for each bead cluster, because bead

378

clusters show different brightness depending on cluster size and injection depth.

379
380

Confocal microscopy. In vivo confocal imaging was performed with a water immersion objective

381

(25× Ob., 1.10 NA or 60× Ob., 1.20 NA) in PBS. The EYFP was excited by 488 nm, and its signal

382

was collected at 500–550 nm in a standard detector. By using a Galvano scanner in one-directional

383

mode, the xy-images comprising 3D stacks were acquired as 512 × 512 pixels at 1 fps or 512 × 256

384

pixels at 2 fps, 2.2 µsec per pixel, which is maximum speed in this condition.

385

To evaluate observable depth in confocal imaging, the CxLI images were captured as 3D stacks

386

with 1 µm z-step size at 50 ± 5, 100 ± 5, and 150 ± 5 µm depth (11 sections) via a 25× Ob. Laser

387

power and detector sensitivity were fixed at 10 % and HV 90, respectively. As references for

388

confocal imaging, the same 3D stacks were also captured by using a two-photon microscope, of

389

which detector sensitivity was fixed at HV 30, but 960-nm laser powers were adjusted to 12.5, 16.1,

390

and 19.2 mW (under 25× Ob.) at 50, 100, and 150 µm depth, respectively.

391

High-resolution 4D imaging with a 60× Ob. was performed as 3D stacks with 1 µm z-step size

392

at approximate 100 ± 15 µm depth (31 sections), as a time-series at 5 minutes intervals for 30

393

minutes (7 time-points). Laser power and detector sensitivity were set between 10 and 20 % and

394

between HV 90 and HV 100, respectively. The 3D display was performed by NIS-Elements

395

software.

396
397

Fluorescence intensity analysis. For two-photon imaging at CxLV and HpCA1, 30 mice

398

(Treatment: control, n = 15; MAGICAL, n = 15) were observed. For confocal imaging at CxLI, 17

399

mice (Treatment: control, n = 8; MAGICAL, n = 9) were observed. In the H-line mice, signal

400

distribution is uneven, especially at the somatic layer, because the EYFP expression level varies

401

among positive neurons, which tend to be differently clustered in different individuals. To avoid

402

selection bias due to individual differences, the imaging area was selected according to the xy

403

position where the hippocampus was observable at the most shallow depth.

404

Fluorescence intensity analysis was performed on the 3D image stacks, by using Fiji/ImageJ

405

software (version 2.0.0-rc-49/1.51d) 38. For sorting of image stacks within each capture condition,

406

mice were ranked in descending order of brightness (average fluorescence intensity per pixel)

407

extracted from image stacks around the center region: at 540 ± 12 µm for the CxLV, approximately

408

at 975 ± 12 µm for the HpCA1, and at 100 ± 5 µm for the CxLI. The top or bottom brightness at

409

each capture condition came from over- or under-exposed image stacks, respectively. Thus, mice

410

having the top or bottom brightness within each treatment group were equally removed from the

411

following analysis, as outliers of the capture condition. Finally, 26 mice (control, n = 13;

412

MAGICAL, n = 13) and 13 mice (control, n = 6; MAGICAL, n = 7) were evaluated in fluorescence

413

intensity analysis for two-photon imaging and confocal imaging, respectively. A representative

414

image for each treatment group at each capture condition was obtained from the mouse scored as

415

intermediate brightness.

416

In the two-photon imaging, we evaluated the fluorescence intensity distributions (FIDs) under

417

HV 30, at three different depths within the observation area. For the CxLV, the three depths were

418

set at 510 ± 3, 540 ± 3 (center), and 570 ± 3 µm depth. For the HpCA1, three depths were relatively

419

adjusted at the middle of stratum pyramidale as the center (0 µm), approximately at 975 ± 3 µm

420

absolute depth, and at 24 µm above and below the center. These three depths were sufficiently far

421

away from each other to ensure separate images in the mice.

422

The FIDs were summarized to 8-bit intensity bins histograms by the Fiji and were visualized

423

through following steps by R (version 3.3.2) 39 with RStudio software (version 1.0.44). The

424

histograms were arranged as a matrix, where the image stacks were sorted in rows according to

425

their brightness in decreasing order, and the intensity bins were aligned in columns. Pixel counts

426

(z) in the histogram were converted with log10(z+1), where 1 is a constant to avoid log10(0)

427

contamination in the converted matrix. The matrix of FIDs was visualized as a heat map. Pixel

428

counts (excluding zero) were ranked in percent quantile. In the heat maps, the 50 % quantile was

429

shown as cyan dotted contours.

430
431

Image similarity analysis. Based on image features, similarities between CM images and 2PM

432

reference images at same CxLI areas were evaluated in 13 mice (Treatment: control, n = 6;

433

MAGICAL, n = 7), which passed fluorescence intensity analysis to remove outliers. The 3D stack

434

images were converted to DccMIP 2D images with a color code shown in Fig. 3a, by using

435

Fiji/ImageJ software. The display range of fluorescence intensity (min–max in 8 bits) were adjusted

436

as fellow: 2PM images at every depth, (0–127); CM images at 50, 100, and 150 µm depth, (0–255),

437

(0–127), and (0–63), respectively.

438

Features extraction and comparison were performed by using OpenCV (version 3.4.2) via a

439

python (version 3.6.6) code. In gray-scale space, a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) 40

440

feature was extracted from each image (512 × 512 pixels) with parameters as fellow: window size,

441

(512, 512); block size, (128, 128); block stride, (4, 4); cell size, (16, 16); nbins, 180; other

442

parameters were used as preset in OpenCV. The raw HOG feature comprising 108,391,680 bins

443

was normalized to 1 to convert a probability histogram. In the comparison between paired two

444

images, a similarity index was defined as the intersection probability of the HOG features.

445
446

Fluorescence Emission Spectrum Transmissive Analysis. For spectral ratio calculation, data

447

processing was performed by using the Fiji/ImageJ software (version 2.0.0-rc-49/1.51d) 38. All xy

448

images in raw data (multi-color 3D stack) were smoothed with the median filter (1 pixel). Pixels

449

having faint or saturated signal values (< 32 or 4063 < in 12 bit, respectively) were excluded from

450

the following calculation. Background area out of beads was detected by an auto-threshold function

451

with the Otsu method on the Yellow channel and was removed from all channels. Spread bead

452

cluster images were selected by ROI (region of interest) to exclude the injection trace from the

453

calculation. The pixels in YG bead clusters were plotted on a scatter graph, corresponding to the

454

Yellow intensity along the x-axis and the Cyan intensity along the y-axis. At depth of interest,

455

representative Cyan/Yellow ratio was determined from the slope of the best-fitted regression line

456

(highest R2) on the scatter plot, derived from image stacks at its depth ± 1.0 µm. To calculate the

457

∆Cyan/Yellow, the Cyan/Yellow ratio was divided by the average of Cyan/Yellow within the

458

experimental group at 100 µm depth.

459
460

Statistics. All statistical analysis was performed by using R (version 3.3.2) 39 with RStudio

461

software (version 1.0.44). Conventional two-tailed Welch's t-test and Cohen's d were calculated

462

with the default and the MBESS package (version 4.3.0), respectively. Permuted

463

Brunner-Munzel41-43 test was executed by the lawstat package (version 3.1) with permutation code.

464

To assess MAGICAL effects on FIDs, we constructed GLMMs with a Gamma error

465

distribution and a log link function. In the models, fluorescence intensities of pixels (FIPs) were

466

used as a response variable. The FID of each image stack at the depth ± 3 µm, therefore, was

467

re-expanded to an intensity list comprised of 786,432 pixels (512 × 512 pixels × 3 sections). To

468

reduce modeling costs, 12,288 pixels (1.56 %) were randomly sampled without overlap from each

469

list. Saturated pixels (255 in 8 bit) were excluded from modeling due to inaccuracies in

470

fluorescence intensity. Zero intensity pixels were also excluded to avoid a calculation failure under

471

the log-link function. “Treatment” (2 levels, MAGICAL or control) and “Depth” (3 levels) were

472

used as categorical predictor variables with fixed effects. The models included an interaction

473

between “Treatment” and “Depth.” To overcome pseudo-replications caused by sampling multiple

474

pixels within each mouse, “Mouse” (26 mice in total) was assigned as a random effect for

475

intercepts and “Depth” slopes. Thus, the models were described in R as follows:

476

FIP ~ Depth * Treatment + (Depth | Mouse)

477

Consequently, the models comprised 929,331 (CxLV) or 957,264 (HpCA1) pixel observations, in

478

78 image stacks extracted at 3 depths from 26 mice under 2 treatments.

479

The model fitting was performed via the maximum likelihood according to Laplace

480

approximation, by using the glmer function in the lme4 package (version 1.1-12). For the estimated

481

coefficient of fixed effect, Wald-type 95 % confidence interval (CI) was calculated by using the

482

confint function. The model prediction for each image stack was obtained through the

483

predict.merMod function in the lme4 package. The fixed effects with asymptotic 95% CI were

484

estimated by using the Effect function in the effects package (version 3.1-2). Pairwise comparisons

485

for the predictor variables were examined by the lsmeans function in the lsmeans package (version

486

2.25-5).

487

As the coefficient of determination for the GLMM, two R2 statistics are proposed44: marginal

488

and conditional R2GLMM. The marginal R2GLMM (R2GLMM(m)) describes the proportion of variance

489

explained only by fixed effects. The conditional R2GLMM (R2GLMM(c)) describes the proportion of

490

variance explained by both fixed and random effects.

An original method for the R2GLMM was limited only to the GLMM including Poisson or

496

binomial error distributions and not including random slope terms44. However, two extensions had

497

been individually provided for the R2GLMM, to calculate random effects variances in random slope

498

models45 or to evaluate further error distribution in the residual variance46. Thus, we calculated the

499

R2GLMM of our models by an R code combining the two extensions as follows: in the extension for

500

random slope models45, provided code generates a square matrix at once but uses only diagonal

501

elements of the matrix. When the code ran for our models, a large number of observations

502

generated a huge square matrix, which caused the computation to fail, due to insufficient memory.

503

Therefore, we calculated only the portion corresponding to the diagonal of the square matrix. On

504

the other hand, the extension for residual variances was applicable to our models without

505

modifications. We selected the trigamma function from three candidates in the paper46, to evaluate

506

the models including a Gamma error distribution and a log link function.
