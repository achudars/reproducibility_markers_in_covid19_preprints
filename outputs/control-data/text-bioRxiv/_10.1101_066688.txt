Abstract
When emerging pathogens encounter new host species for which they are poorly adapted, they

must evolve to escape extinction. Pathogens experience selection on traits at multiple scales,
including replication rates within host individuals and transmissibility between hosts. We analyze

a stochastic model linking pathogen growth and competition within individuals to transmission
between individuals. Our analysis reveals a new factor, the cross-scale reproductive number, that

quantifies how quickly mutant strains increase in frequency when they initially appear in the
infected host population. This cross-scale reproductive number combines with viral mutation

rates, single-strain reproductive numbers, and transmission bottleneck width to determine the

Introduction
2

Emerging infectious diseases are rising in frequency and impact and are placing a growing
burden on public health and world economies [1–4]. Nearly all of these emergence events involve

4

pathogens that are exposed to novel environments such as zoonotic pathogens entering human
populations from non-human animal reservoirs, or human pathogens exposed to antimicrobial

6

drugs [1]. In these novel environments, pathogens may experience new selective forces acting at
multiple biological scales, leading to reduced replication rates within hosts or less efficient

8

transmission between hosts. When these novel environments are sufficiently harsh, emergence only
occurs when the pathogen adapts sufficiently quickly to avoid extinction. As genetic sequencing of

10

pathogens becomes increasingly widespread, there are clear signs of such rapid adaptation [5–11],
but we lack a cohesive framework to understand how this process might work across scales.

12

Theoretical studies have shed important insights into circumstances under which this evolutionary
emergence is possible, but either have focused on the host-to-host transmission dynamics and

14

treated within-host dynamics only implicitly [12–15], or have accounted for explicit within-host
dynamics only along a fixed transmission chain [16, 17]. Here, we introduce and analyze a model

16

explicitly linking these two biological scales and demonstrate how within-host viral competition,
infection duration, transmission dynamics within a host population, and the size of transmission

18

bottlenecks determine the likelihood of evolutionary emergence. This analysis sheds new light on
factors governing pathogen emergence, addresses long-standing questions about evolutionary

20

aspects of emergence, and lays the foundation for making risk assessments which integrate
outcomes from in vitro and in vivo experiments with findings from sequence-based surveillance in

22

the field.
Recent empirical findings have highlighted the need for a new generation of theory on pathogen

24

emergence, which addresses the current frontiers of dynamics within hosts and across scales. For
most pathogens, and certainly for RNA viruses and single-stranded DNA viruses, individual hosts

26

often are not dominated by single pathogen genotypes [18, 19]. Furthermore, at the host
population scale, pathogen allele frequencies at a given locus exhibit a range of dynamics from

28

rapid selective sweeps for drug resistance or immune escape [20–22] to gradually changing

4

frequencies [23, 24]. Together, these observations lead to the long-standing question of whether
2

adaptive evolution of viruses occurs within single hosts by rapid fixation of beneficial mutants, or
more slowly by a gradual shift of allele frequencies along chains of transmission [25, 26]. A recent

4

wave of studies tracking changes in within-host genetic diversity through chains of transmission
among hosts [27–34] provide unique opportunities to address this question, but a theoretical

6

framework is needed.
Empirical studies, together with analyses at broader population scales, have highlighted the

8

crucial influence of the transmission process – and particularly the population bottleneck
associated with transmission – in filtering viral diversity. The existence of transmission

10

bottlenecks has long been recognized, and is hypothesized to play a critical role in pathogen
evolution [35–40]. Recent studies have reported that bottleneck widths vary considerably among

12

pathogens and routes of transmission [41, 42], and perhaps across different phases of host
adaptation [43]. Narrow transmission bottleneck sizes of 1 to 2 viral genotypes are common for

14

HIV-1 [44–46] and hepatitis C virus [47, 48], and bottlenecks of 1 to 3 viruses are reported for
influenza in ferret respiratory droplet transmission experiments [41, 42, 49] and in some studies of

16

natural human transmission [50, 51]. Much wider bottleneck estimates, of 30 to over 100 viruses,
have been reported for natural transmission of influenza in horses [29] and swine [52]; for ferret

18

transmission experiments via direct contact [41, 42]; and for transmission of Ebola virus among
humans [53]. While wide bottlenecks were also reported for natural influenza transmission among

20

humans [54, 55], this was determined to be a bioinformatic artefact [56].
A major frontier in understanding viral adaptation is how the transmission process influences

22

evolution at population scales. Past work has emphasized the potentially deleterious effect of
genetic drift [35, 37, 39], but a rising tide of studies reports direct selection for transmissibility.

24

This can arise as a strong selection bias at the transmission bottleneck, where strains present at
low or undetectable frequencies in the donor host are preferentially transmitted to the

26

recipient [43, 49, 57, 58], or it can be measured directly via experimental infection and
transmission studies [24, 59–61] (though we emphasize that enhanced transmissibility is not

28

inevitable, and depends on availability of suitable adaptive genotypes [62]). Overall transmission

5

rates can be viewed as being determined by total viral loads, weighted by genotype-specific
2

transmissibilities [58]. Importantly, the transmissibility trait can vary independently from viral
replication fitness within hosts, so there is potential for conflicts in selection across scales. Indeed,

4

there is clear evidence that HIV-1 has certain genotypes that transmit more efficiently, but then
the within-host population tends to evolve toward lower-transmission strains during an

6

infection [46, 58, 63–65]; a similar phenomenon has been reported for H5N1 influenza [49] and
H9N2 influenza [66]. In an extreme example, Plasmodium parasites were found to rapidly evolve

8

resistance to an antimalarial drug, but at the cost of complete loss of transmissibility [67].
Experimental evolution studies have highlighted how antagonistic pleiotropy can lead to tradeoffs

10

between viral replication and the extracellular survival that is required for transmission [68, 69],
and a similar tradeoff has been postulated for environmental transmission of avian influenza in the

12

field [70]. Together these findings contribute to a growing evidence base that cross-scale conflicts
in selection may inhibit the emergence of new viral strains in many systems [reviewed in 15].

14

Collectively these empirical findings highlight the need for a theory of evolutionary emergence
that accounts explicitly for the within-host dynamics of competing viral strains, transmission

16

bottlenecks, and host-to-host transmission dynamics [71]. To this end, we introduce and analyze a
model which integrates previous work on stochastic models of evolutionary emergence and

18

deterministic models explicitly coupling within- and between-host
dynamics [12, 14, 16, 17, 60, 65, 72–75]. Our analysis allows us to address several fundamental

20

questions about the emergence of novel pathogens: What factors limit evolutionary emergence for
pathogens with different life histories? Why do some apparently ‘nearby’ adaptive mutants fail to

22

emerge? How do bottleneck sizes influence the likelihood of emergence? Do evolutionary changes
occur swiftly within individual hosts, or gradually across chains of transmission? Moreover, our

24

analysis allows us to examine the relative importance of genetic diversity in zoonotic reservoirs
versus the acquisition of new mutations following spillover into humans [76–78]. Specifically, we

26

address the long-standing question of how much emergence risk is increased if the “spillover
inoculum” includes some genotypes bearing adaptive mutations for the novel host? Finally, our

analysis enables us to unify findings from previous theoretical studies, and propose mechanistic
2

interpretations of phenomenological parameters from earlier work.
Models and Methods

4

Our stochastic multiscale model of evolutionary emergence follows a finite number of
individuals in a large, susceptible host population exposed to a pathogen from a reservoir

6

population (Fig 1A). Although our framework represents many types of pathogens and can be
extended to any number of strains, we focus on the case of a viral pathogen with two strains: a

8

wild-type maladapted for the novel environment and a mutant strain potentially adapted for the
novel environment.

10

The cross-scale model with explicit within-host dynamics. Formally, the cross-scale model
is a continuous time, age-dependent, multi-type branching process [79, 80]. The “type” of

12

individual corresponds to the composition of the initial virus population (i.e. the founding viral
population that initiates the infection), and the “age” of an individual corresponds to the time

14

since their initial infection. Within an infected host, the viral dynamics determine how the viral
load and viral composition change over time due to competition between strains and mutation

16

events. Transmission events are determined by the viral load and composition of the host and,
consequently, are age-dependent. Below, we describe the model at each scale and the biological

18

processes we consider in detail. The mean-field analogue of our model is an age-structured partial
differential equation of the general type introduced by Coombs et al. [73].

20

Within-host scale model. Infection of a host usually starts locally at the site of viral entry or first
tissue contact. This local spread involves a small number of viruses, their infection of host cells at

22

the exposure interface and possibly the innate immune response to infection [81, 82]. During this
period, infection is stochastic and establishment of infection is not guaranteed [82, 83]. When one

24

or more virions survive the period of initial local spread, they establish lineages that comprise the
productive infection. These virions are termed as transmitted founder viruses [44]. Here, we

26

explicitly define the number of transmitted founder viruses that establish productive infection as
the bottleneck width N . This quantity can be estimated using viral genetic sequencing data, for

Figure 1. The cross-scale dynamic of evolutionary emergence. An individual is
initially infected from the reservoir host population (panel A) with only the wild
type viral strain (in blue). Within an infected individual (panel B), the viral load
increases at an exponential rate until saturating at day Te and ending after T days.
Mutations ensure individuals typically have a mixed infection with wild-type (blue)
and mutant (red) viral strains (panel B). The likelihood of transmission between
individuals, and the composition of the infecting dose (panel C), depend on the size
and composition of the infected individual’s viral load at the time of contact, and
on the transmissibility of each strain. As the infection spreads in the population
(panel A), the frequency of the mutant virions among infected individuals varies
(panel D) and, ultimately, determines whether evolutionary emergence occurs. In D,
each horizontal line marks the infectious period of an individual whose infection was
initiated with that percentage of the mutant strain and the vertical arrows represent
transmission events between individuals.

example in [44, 55]. Our within-host model starts with the transmitted founder viruses by
2

assuming an initial viral load N , and hence considers the period of established productive
infection only (as with other within-host models [84, 85] and cross-scale deterministic models

4

[73]). The initial viral exposure and stochastic local infection process are implicitly incorporated
into the transmission term in the population scale model as described below, and consequently, we

6

consider a successful transmission event as a transmission event leading to an established infection.

The within-host dynamics are modeled with coupled differential equations where

where i 6= j are either w or m, for wild-type and mutant strains respectively, and µ is the
4

mutation rate between these strains. At time t = 0, v(0) = (vw (0), vm (0)) corresponds to the
initial viral load of an infected individual, and vw (0) + vm (0) = N . Our within-host model is

6

similar in structure to the quasi-species model of Lythgoe et al. [65].
In this model, the viral population initially increases exponentially because of the availability of

8

a large number of target cells. The wild-type and mutant strains increase exponentially at rates,
rw and rm , respectively. These dynamics are consistent with the viral dynamics predicted by

10

standard multistrain within-host models when target cells are abundant [86–88]. The viral load
saturates at time Te with a maximal viral load K (Fig 1B). Without losing generality, we assume

12

that after Te , the viral population size stays constant at K, and the frequencies of the wild-type
and the mutant change due to their fitness differences. We further assume that the infectious

14

period ends after T days. For acute infections, viral load usually decreases rapidly after viral
peak, and thus T is close to Te . For chronic infections, such as HIV and Hepatitis C virus, viral

16

loads usually reach a set-point. In this case, T is much greater than Te . Overall, this within-host
model serves as a flexible framework to describe a range of viral dynamics from both acute and

18

chronic infections, while maintaining simplicity to enable analysis.

Population scale model. At the scale of the host population, the transmission dynamics are
20

modeled using a multi-type branching process. Each infectious individual encounters a
Poisson-distributed number of susceptible individuals at a rate of β individuals per day. Then, the

22

number of contacts of an infected individual during the infectious period is Poisson distributed
with mean βT . Each contact results in a successful transmission event with probability p(E)

24

where E is the effective viral load at the time t of transmission (see below). Similar to the
deterministic model of Lythgoe et al. [65], p(E) is an increasing function of E. Our main analyses

9

assume that the transmission function p(E) is linear, but nonlinear transmission functions yield
2

nearly identical results (Figs. Appendix–2 through 4).
The effective viral load E is calculated as E = bw vw (t) + bm vm (t) , where bw and bm are the

4

transmissibilities of the wild-type and the mutant, respectively. Here bw and bm account for the
survival of the viruses through a range of processes during transmission, including their likelihoods

6

of being shed from the donor host, surviving the environment outside of a host, and reaching and
infecting the target cells in an uninfected host. Furthermore, as explained in the within-host

8

model section, these parameters also account for the likelihoods of the viruses to survive initial
local infection and establish a productive infection in the recipient host. Viruses may face different

10

challenges and selection pressures to overcome the barriers in each of these processes. Here, for
simplicity and generality, a single parameter is used to summarize the transmissibility of different

12

viruses because little is known or measured about the ability of a virus to overcome these barriers.
More explicit models can be constructed as the relevant data become available.

14

In the event of successful transmission, there are N virions (the transmitted founder viruses)
that establish the productive infection. In the model, these N virions are sampled binomially from

16

the source individual’s viral load weighted by the transmissibilities of the viral strains. Thus, the
probability of infecting an individual with a viral load of ṽ = (ṽw , ṽm ) with ṽw + ṽm = N equals

Overall, by explicitly modeling the cross-scale dynamics, our model simultaneously tracks the
22

number of infected hosts and the viral loads within each infected host (Fig 1D). The structure of
our stochastic model is similar to Peck et al. [16]’s stochastic model of molecular viral evolution

24

along transmission chains. However, our model accounts for stochastic transmission dynamics
rather than conditioning on a chain of transmission, and explicitly accounts for the dynamics of

10

competing viral strains. It also has similarities with Geoghegan et al. [17]’s cross-scale, stochastic
2

model of a single transmission event from a donor host to a recipient host. Like our model,
Geoghegan et al. [17]’s model has constant transmission bottlenecks, multinomial sampling from

4

donor to host, and explicit within host dynamics with exponential growth and ceiling phases.
Their model, however, focuses on a single transmission event and assumes that all virions are

6

equally likely to be transmitted from donor to host, i.e. it assumes no selection based on
transmissibility.

8

Methods. To solve the probabilities of emergence, we use the discrete-time branching process
given by censusing the infected population at the beginning of each generation of infection. This

10

discrete-time process is known as the embedded process [79, 80]. All the statistics of this
embedded process are given by the probability generating map G : [0, 1]N +1 → [0, 1]N +1 where

12

N + 1 is the number of types of initial viral loads i.e. all combinations of wild-type and mutant
virions for N virions [79, 80]. We index the coordinates by the initial number of mutant virions

The i-th coordinate of
q(t) = Gt (0, . . . , 0)
16

is the probability of extinction by generation t when there is initially one infected individual with
initial viral load (i, N − i). The probability of emergence is given by 1 − q where q = limt→∞ q(t)

18

is the asymptotic extinction probability. The limit theorem of branching processes implies that
q = (q0 , . . . , qN ) is the smallest (with respect to the standard ordering of the positive cone),

20

non-negative solution of the equation q = G(0, . . . , 0). These extinction probabilities can be
non-zero if and only if the dominant eigenvalue of the Jacobian matrix DG(1, 1, . . . , 1) is greater

22

than one. Equivalently, the reproductive number given by the dominant eigenvalue of the next
generation matrix of DG(1, 1, . . . , 1) is greater than one [89]. Note that the linear map

s 7→ DG(1, 1, . . . , 1)s corresponds to the mean-field dynamics of the embedded multi-type
2

branching process.
For the numerical work, we used linear, logarithmic, and saturating functions for the

4

transmission probability function p. All gave similar results but we present the linear case as most
analytical results were derived for this case. To compute the asymptotic extinction probabilities,

6

we iterated the probability generating map G for 2, 000 generations. For the individual based
simulations, we solved the within-host differential equations using matrix exponentials and

8

renormalizing these exponentials when the viral load reached the value K. Between host
transmission events were determined by a time-dependent Poisson process with rate function

10

p(bw vw (t) + bm vm (t)), and multinomial sampling was used to determine the initial viral load of an
infected individual.

Results

12

The probability of evolutionary emergence. We first focus on the scenario of a single
14

individual in the host population getting infected by the wild-type strain. We assume that the
mean number of individuals infected by this individual (the reproductive number Rw of the

16

wild-type) is less than one. Hence, in the absence of mutations, there is no chance of a major
outbreak [89]. However, if the wild-type strain produces a mutant strain whose reproductive

18

number Rm is greater than one, there is a chance for a major outbreak. The mutant strain might
have a higher reproductive number than the wild-type strain because it replicates more rapidly

20

within the host or because it transmits more effectively to new hosts (or both). We define these
within-host and between-host selective advantages as s = rm − rw and τ = log(bm ) − log(bw ),

22

respectively.
Consistent with theoretical expectations, a non-zero probability of evolutionary emergence

24

requires the mutant’s reproductive number Rm to be greater than one (Fig 2). However, the
mixture of selective advantages or disadvantages of the mutant strain that give rise to Rm > 1

26

depends in a complex manner on the pathogen’s life history traits, such as the duration of the
infection (Fig 2A,B vs. C,D) and the transmission bottleneck width (Fig 2A,C vs. B,D). Notably,

for long-term infections with a large transmission bottleneck size, the emergence probability can
2

be effectively zero (i.e. < 10−16 ) for mutant strains whose reproductive number exceeds one (white
region bounded by the solid red curve in Fig 2D) – a finding not explained by classical theory.

4

To understand these complexities, we determine the conditions under which the mutant’s
reproductive number Rm exceeds one, and then present analytic approximations for the emergence

6

probability when Rm > 1.
Cross-scale selection and the mutant reproductive number Rm . The reproductive

8

numbers of the wild-type strain (Rw ) and mutant strain (Rm ) can be calculated as the product of
the contact rate, the average transmissibility of the strain during the infectious period, and the

10

infection duration (see, Coombs et al. [73] and Appendix). These reproductive numbers are
positively correlated with the contact rate, infection duration, transmissibility, and viral

12

per-capita growth rates. The influence of the maximal viral load K depends on the infection
duration. For short-term infections, defined here as infections with a relatively short saturated

14

phase (i.e. T − Te  Te ), increasing K has little effect on a strain’s reproductive number. For
long-term infections, defined here as as infections with a long saturated phase (i.e. T − Te  Te ),

16

reproductive numbers increase with K.
Whether a selective advantage at either scale results in the mutant reproductive number Rm

18

exceeding one depends on the duration of the infection. For short-term infections, most
transmissions occur towards the end of the infectious period T , when the infectious load is the

20

highest. By the end of the infectious period, the mutant viral density has increased approximately
by a factor of esT more than the wild-type, and transmission for each mutant virion is exp(τ ) more

22

likely than for a wild-type virion. Refining this intuition, we derive the approximation (Appendix)
(2)

log Rm ≈ log Rw + τ + s(T − 1/rw ).

This approximation shows that a sufficiently strong selective advantage at either scale can result
24

in the mutant reproductive number exceeding one (Rm > 1) despite a selective disadvantage at
the other scale (confirmed by exact calculations in Fig 2A,B). For short-term infections where

26

viral dynamics are dominated by the exponential phase, the longer the duration of infection, the

14

greater the influence of the within-host selective advantage compared to the between-host selective
2

advantage (e.g., steep contours in Fig 2A).
For long-term infections, the viral load will tend to K for both purely wild-type or purely

4

mutant infections. Thus, the only difference will be in transmissibility and we get the
approximation (Appendix)
log Rm ≈ log Rw + τ.

(3)
6

This approximation implies that a between-host selective advantage is required for a long-term
infection to be capable of evolutionary emergence (confirmed by exact calculations in Fig 2C).

When viral dynamics are dominated by the saturated phase at fixed K, a within-host selective
advantage has little impact on the average viral load during the infectious period of an individual

10

solely infected with the mutant strain and, consequently, provides a minimal increase in the
mutant reproductive number.

12

Going beyond the mutant reproductive number. When the mutant strain has a
reproductive number greater than one, there is a non-zero probability of a major outbreak that is

This expression, which can be viewed a multiscale extension of earlier theory [12, 13], highlights

three key ingredients, in addition to Rm > 1, for evolutionary emergence.
First, the size of the minor outbreak produced by the wild type determines the number of

opportunities for the mutant strain to appear within a host. The average size of this minor
outbreak equals

as noted by earlier studies [12, 13]. If the wild strain is badly maladapted,

then it is expected not to spread to multiple individuals (e.g. if Rw < 1/2, then

< 2) and

opportunities for transmission of mutant virions are very limited. Alternatively, if the wild strain
22

is only slightly maladapted to the new host, then, even without any mutations, the pathogen is

15

expected to spread to many individuals (e.g. if Rw = 0.95, then
2

1−Rw

= 20), thereby providing

greater opportunities for evolutionary emergence. Our analysis implies that higher contact rates,
within-host viral growth rates, viral transmissibility, and maximal viral loads (for long infectious

4

periods) facilitate these larger reproductive values.
Second, the mutant strain must be transmitted successfully to susceptible individuals — the

6

second term of our approximation (4). For an individual initially infected only with the wild-type
strain, the mean number of transmission events with mutant virions equals the product of the

8

contact rate, the infection duration, and the likelihood that a mutant virion is transmitted during
a contact event, averaged over the full course of infection (Appendix). The likelihood of

10

transmitting mutant virions on the tth day of infection is proportional to the product of the
transmission bottleneck width (N ), the within-host frequency of the mutant strain, and the

12

transmissibility bm of the mutant strain. This highlights an important distinction between
short-term and long-term infections. For short-term infections where sT is small, there is

14

insufficient time for the frequency of mutants to rise within a host, so transmission events with
mutant virions are rare (< 1/1, 000 for all black contour lines in Fig 2A,B). This is a key obstacle

16

to evolutionary emergence in short-term infections. In contrast, for long-term infections where the
mutant strain has a substantial within-host selective advantage, the mutant strain is transmitted

18

frequently (e.g. the expected number of events > 1 for some contours in Fig 2C,D).
Finally, even if the mutant strain is successfully transmitted, an individual infected with the

20

mutant strain needs to give rise to a major outbreak — the third term of equation (4). This
requires the mutant strain to rise in frequency in the infected host population. A mean field

22

analysis for larger bottleneck sizes (N > 5 in the simulations) reveals that mutant frequency
initially grows geometrically by a factor α that equals the number of mutant virions, on average,

24

transmitted by an individual initially infected with a single mutant virion and N − 1 wild type
virions (Appendix). We call α the cross-scale reproductive number as it corresponds to the

26

number of mutant virions in the initial viral load at the beginning of the next disease generation
produced by a mutant virion in the initial viral load of the current disease generation. If this

28

cross-scale reproductive number is greater than one, then each mutant virion replaces itself with

16

more than one mutant virion in the next generation of infection, and the frequency of mutant
2

virions increases in the infected host population. If the cross-scale reproductive number α is less
than one, the frequency of mutants decreases, thereby hindering evolutionary emergence.

4

For short-term infections, the cross-scale reproductive number α is equal to the ratio of the
basic reproductive numbers:
(5)

6

α=

Rm
Rw

Thus for short-term infections there is no additional condition required for emergence. Whenever
the mutant reproductive number Rm exceeds one, there is a mean tendency for the mutant strain

8

to increase in frequency once it has been successfully transmitted to susceptible individuals (i.e.
α > 1 because Rm > 1 > Rw ). The greater the ratio Rm /Rw , the more rapid the increase in

10

frequency.
For long-term infections, there is sufficient time for within-host selection to change the

12

frequency of the mutant strain within a host. Larger transmission bottlenecks increase the
likelihood that these changes in frequency are transmitted between hosts. For these long infectious

14

periods and larger bottlenecks, a within-host selective disadvantage reduces the cross-scale
reproductive number α (Appendix):
(6)

16

α ≈ exp(τ + sT /2) for s sufficiently small.

Hence, the cross-scale reproductive number α may be less than one even when the mutant
reproductive number Rm is greater than one. This phenomenon, which arises from the interplay of

18

dynamics at within-host and between-host scales, moderated by the transmission bottleneck
width, explains the puzzling behavior about the emergence probabilities noted earlier (the white

20

region bounded by solid and dashed red lines in Fig 2D).
The importance of these frequency dynamics can be visualized via individual-based outbreak

22

simulations, and cobwebbing diagrams summarizing the mean field dynamics. When the mutant
reproductive number Rm is greater than one but its cross-scale reproductive number α is less than

24

one, mutant virions may be transmitted but the resulting mixed infections are invariably taken

For longterm infections with moderate to large transmission bottlenecks (N > 5), individualbased simulations corresponding to three values of the cross-scale reproductive number α illustrate (A) the mutant strain decreasing in frequency (despite an index
case initially only infected with the mutant strain) when the cross-scale reproductive
number α is less than one, (B) a gradual sweep to fixation of the mutant strain when

virions are very slow to appear. When the within-host selective disadvantage is weak and the
2

between-host selective advantage is strong, the cross-scale reproductive number may be slightly
greater than one and the mutant strain can drift to higher frequencies within the infected host

4

population (Fig 3B). For large within-host selective advantages, the cross-scale reproductive
number is large and the mutant strain can sweep rapidly to fixation in the infected host

6

population (Fig 3C). Thus, in addition to revealing a new condition needed for evolutionary
emergence, the cross-scale reproductive number α summarizes the conditions under which

8

evolution occurs swiftly or gradually within chains of transmission.
The dueling effects of transmission bottlenecks. Wider bottlenecks increase the likelihood

10

of evolutionary emergence for pathogens with a short infectious period, but can hinder or
facilitate evolutionary emergence of long-term infections (Fig 4A,B). For short-term infections,

12

evolutionary emergence is constrained primarily by the transmission of mutant virions by
individuals initially infected with only the wild strain. Wider transmission bottlenecks alleviate

14

this constraint, especially when the mutant strain is expected to increase rapidly within the
infected population (α  1; Fig 4A). When the mutant strain rises slowly in the infected host

16

population (α slightly greater than one), the emergence probability is insensitive to the bottleneck
size, regardless of infection duration.

18

For long-term infections for which the mutant strain’s reproductive number Rm is greater than
one, but the cross-scale reproductive number α is less than one, emergence probabilities decrease

20

sharply with bottleneck size (Fig 4B and Appendix). Because a mutant reproductive number Rm
greater than one requires a between-host selective advantage (τ > 0) for a long-term infection, the

22

cross-scale reproductive number α is less than one only if there is a within-host selective
disadvantage (s < 0) so that mixed infections tend to be taken over by the wild-type.

24

Consequently, the mutant virus can start an epidemic only when a host is infected with an initial
viral load composed of mutant particles only, an event that becomes increasingly unlikely for

26

larger bottleneck sizes N .
Mutant spillover events hasten evolutionary emergence. When the mutant strain is

spillover events of any size can substantially increase the chance of emergence (top three curves in

Discussion
2

We have presented a cross-scale model for evolutionary emergence of novel pathogens, linking
explicit representations of viral growth and competition within host individuals to viral

4

transmission between individuals. This framework integrates and extends the findings of past
theory on this problem by including mixed infections, explicit transmission bottlenecks, and a

6

distinct trait of transmissibility for each viral genotype, phenomena that are highlighted by
current empirical research as essential components of viral evolution. Our work identifies four

8

steps to evolutionary emergence (Fig 5) and four ingredients that govern these steps: (i) the
reproductive number of the wild type which determines the size of a minor outbreak of this strain,

10

(ii) the rate at which individuals infected initially with the wild-type strain transmit the mutant
strain, and (iii) the cross-scale reproductive number which corresponds to the mean number of

12

mutant virions transmitted by an individual whose initial infection only included one mutant
virion, and (iv) the reproductive number of the mutant strain. Prior studies of evolutionary

14

emergence [12–15] identified the importance of the single strain reproductive numbers, Rm and
Rw , and a phenomenological ‘mutation rate’, but ingredients (ii) and (iii) are new mechanistic

16

insights arising from the cross-scale dynamics. By analyzing these ingredients of evolutionary
emergence, we show how the probability of emergence is governed by selection pressures at

18

within-host and between-host scales, the width of the transmission bottleneck, and the infection
duration. We also map the conditions under which different broad-scale patterns are observed,

20

from rapid selective sweeps to slower diffusion of new types. While our study has focused on
within-host and between-host scales of selection, it could be generalized readily to other types of

22

cross-scale dynamics where selection may act differently at different scales, such as within-farm
and between-farm scales where genetic data have given insights into the emergence of

24

high-pathogenicity avian influenza strains [90].
Previous theoretical studies of evolutionary emergence of novel pathogens [12–15] have assumed

26

infected individuals are, at any point in time, infected primarily by a single pathogen strain.
Consequently, shifts from infection with one strain to infection with another must occur abruptly,

28

relative to other processes. Such abrupt shifts could correspond to within-host selective sweeps or,

22

if mutant strains remain at low frequency, to rare events in which only the mutant strain is
2

transmitted. The seminal studies [12, 13] showed that under these conditions the probability of
emergence is proportional to the frequency of these events, which they bundled together into a

4

phenomenological “mutation rate”.
Our cross-scale analysis identifies the mechanistic counterpart to this phenomenological

6

“mutation rate”, which is the probability that an individual infected initially with the wild-type
strain ends up transmitting at least one virion of the mutant strain (Step 3 in Fig 5). This

8

quantity, which is approximated by the black contours in Fig 2, is governed chiefly by the ability
of the mutant strain to reach an appreciable frequency within the host over the course of an

10

infection. This is evident from the strong dependence on the strength of within-host
selection—which surprisingly is much stronger than the dependence on the transmission

12

advantage of mutant virions—and the higher values found for larger bottleneck widths, which
favor transmission of low-frequency mutants through a straight-forward sampling effect. This

14

sampling effect is consistent with the theoretical work of Geoghegan et al. [17], and the
experimental study of Frise et al. [42], who found larger bottlenecks increased the likelihood of

16

mutant viral strains being transmitted between hosts. The duration of infection plays a crucial
role, and our analysis showed that achieving this first transmission of the adaptive mutant is a key

18

barrier to evolutionary emergence for short-term infections (Fig 2A,B). This finding aligns with
the recent observation that putative immune-escape mutants of pandemic H1N1 influenza, which

20

should have a within-host fitness advantage, were generated readily in infected humans but did
not reach high within-host frequency and have been detected very rarely at the consensus level

22

(i.e. they have failed to emerge) [91]. While more investigation is needed to determine the
relevant s and τ parameters for these strains, these data are consistent with the mechanism we

24

identify whereby these variants may be adaptive but have insufficient time to reach high enough
frequencies to avoid being lost in transmission bottlenecks.

26

Our analysis highlights an additional factor, the cross-scale reproductive number α, previously
unrecognized in models neglecting within-host diversity and analyses centered on R0 for pure

28

infections. Even after the mutant strain has been transmitted, it needs to increase in frequency at

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/066688; this version posted December 23, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

23

the scale of the infected host population (Step 4 in Fig 5). Specifically, each transmitted mutant
2

virion, on average, needs to replace itself with more than one transmitted mutant virion in the
next generation of infected hosts. When this occurs, it sets up a positive feedback along chains of

4

infections: individuals with a higher frequency of the mutant strain tend to infect more
individuals, which in turn provides more opportunities to transmit, on average, higher frequencies

6

of the mutant strain to the next generation. Conversely, when this between-generation cross-scale
reproductive number is less than one, the positive feedback leads to lower and lower frequencies of

8

the mutant strain within the infected host population. This positive feedback mechanism is
stronger for wider transmission bottlenecks (≥ 5 virions in our numerical explorations), which

10

better preserve the mutant frequency from one host to the next. Interestingly, this ≥ 5 virion
threshold for transmission bottlenecks is consistent with the threshold eliminating fitness losses in

12

models of RNA virus evolution in plaque to plaque transfers of diluted viral solutions on plates of
susceptible cells [40].

14

The directionality of the positive feedback is more complex, and depends on multiple factors
including the infection duration and the presence or absence of cross-scale conflicts. For long-term

16

infections, mutant frequencies can drop deterministically within a host, and hence prevent
emergence, even if the mutant strain has a reproductive number greater than one. This occurs

18

when the mutant strain has a within-host selective disadvantage and between-host selective
advantage (upper left quadrant of Fig 2D); the long infectious period allows time for the

20

within-host disadvantage to drive the mutant strain to lower frequency and, thereby, set up the
positive feedback effectively preventing evolutionary emergence. In contrast, for short-term

22

infections the mutant strain tends to rise in frequency whenever the mutant reproductive number
is greater than one, because there is insufficient time for any within-host disadvantage to act. In

24

particular, evolutionary emergence may occur despite within-host selective disadvantages, a
possibility excluded by previous theory [15]. Collectively these two results imply that, in the face

26

of cross-scale conflict and wide transmission bottlenecks, longer infectious periods can inhibit,
rather than facilitate [14], evolutionary emergence (Fig 2B,D). Related to this result, Geoghegan

28

et al. [17] found that longer durations of the infectious period would lower the probability that a

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/066688; this version posted December 23, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

24

donor would infect the recipient. In their case, this occurred because fitness of the mutant was
2

assumed to be lower in the donor host species and higher in the recipient species. Hence, a longer
infectious period could purge any mutants arising in the donor and result in the recipient only

4

receiving wild-type virions.
Previous theoretical studies examining the evolutionary consequences of cross-scale conflict [e.g.

6

65, 72, 73] differ from ours in several ways. Notably, they consider longer-term evolution for
endemic diseases using deterministic models, rather than the inherently stochastic, shorter-term

8

dynamics of evolutionary emergence. Using multiscale endemic SIR models, Coombs et al. [73]
found that pathogen strains competitively superior at the within-host scale could be displaced by

10

competitively inferior strains that had higher reproductive numbers at the epidemiological scale.
This phenomenon was driven by non-equilibrium within-host dynamics, where early fluctuations

12

in strain frequencies could have disproportionate influence if host survival was short. Our work
reveals the converse case, where strains with lower reproductive numbers at the epidemiological

14

scale (in fact, less than one) can prevent evolutionary emergence if they have a within-host
advantage, by causing the adapted strains to have a cross-scale reproductive number α of less

16

than one. Consistent with our result, Lythgoe et al. [65] showed found that deterministic,
multistrain models could produce equilibrium states dominated by strains that were competitively

18

superior at the within-host scale, despite reducing the reproductive number at the epidemiological
scale. Parallel to our finding that cross-scale conflict occurred only for long-term infections,

20

Lythgoe et al. [65]’s short-sighted evolution was most pronounced when within-host dynamics
occurred at a faster time-scale.

22

Our cross-scale analysis also enables us to address two long-standing and interrelated questions
in emerging pathogen research, regarding the influence of transmission bottleneck size on

24

emergence probability and the importance of “pre-adapted” mutations circulating in the animal
reservoir [17, 71, 76–78, 92]. In both cases, the answer depends on the cross-scale reproductive

26

number α that governs the frequency feedback. Under most circumstances, wider bottlenecks
boost the probability of emergence (Fig 4A,B), because they favor the onward transmission of

28

mutant virions when they are rare; this is particularly vital for the first transmission of mutant

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/066688; this version posted December 23, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

25

virions (i.e. Step 3 in Fig. 5). The exception is for long-term infections with α < 1, such that the
2

mutant tends to decline in frequency in the infected host population. Under these circumstances,
wider bottlenecks hinder emergence by propagating reductions in the frequency of the mutant

4

strain more efficiently from host to host (Step 4 in Fig. 5). Conventional thinking about the
influence of bottlenecks on viral adaptation emphasizes fitness losses due to genetic drift and the

6

effects of Muller’s ratchet [35–37, 39, 40], which become more severe for narrower bottlenecks.
Contrary to these negative effects of narrow bottlenecks, our findings highlight that narrower

8

bottlenecks can aid emergence in long-term infections with a cross-scale conflict in selection
(Fig 4B). Here the adaptive gain in transmissibility at population scales can be impeded by the

10

selective disadvantage at the within-host scale, but, intriguingly, this disadvantage is neutralized
by genetic drift arising from narrow bottlenecks. Given the evidence for cross-scale evolutionary

12

conflicts for HIV-1 [58, 63, 64, 93], our results suggest the possibility that HIV-1’s narrow
transmission bottleneck [44] could play a role in the emergence of novel strains (e.g. drug resistant

14

strains).
Similar mechanisms dictate the influence of mutant viral strains circulating in the reservoir,

16

particularly for long-term infections (Fig 4C,D). If the cross-scale reproductive number α is
greater than one, so that the mutant frequency rises easily in the infected host population, then

18

even low frequencies of mutants in the reservoir lead to substantial risk of emergence. Indeed, for
long-term infections with α > 1, emergence becomes almost certain when there are mutants in the

20

initial spillover inoculum. Conversely, when the cross-scale reproductive number is less than one,
emergence probability scales with the proportion of mutants in the initial dose, and when α  1,

22

the initial dose must consist almost entirely of the mutant strain in order to pose any major risk.
These findings yield direct lessons for the growing enterprise of conducting genetic surveillance on

24

zoonotic pathogens in their animal reservoirs [94–97]. A crucial requirement for effective genetic
surveillance is the ability to identify genotypes of concern; the integration of various research

26

approaches to address this question, and estimate key quantities, is an on-going research
challenge [98–100]. Risk to humans increases if there is any non-zero proportion of mutant viruses

28

in the spillover inoculum, so tracking the presence of such mutants is beneficial. Surprisingly, the

26

quantitative frequency of mutants in the initial dose has little impact on emergence probability in
2

most scenarios, with the one exception of long-term infections with α < 1. Collectively, these
results suggest that any knowledge of the cross-scale reproductive number and mutant

4

reproductive numbers can help to refine our goals for genetic surveillance, and that in many
circumstances presence/absence detection is sufficient.

6

While there are not sufficient data from past emergence events to test our model’s conclusions,
recent studies combining animal transmission experiments with deep sequencing have exhibited

8

many phenomena aligned with our findings. Moncla et al. [43] conducted deep sequencing
analyses of H1N1 influenza viruses, in the context of ferret airborne transmission experiments that

10

examined the adaptation of avian-like viruses to the mammalian host. Their results provide
in-depth insights into selection within hosts and at transmission bottlenecks, for a range of

12

mutations on genetic backgrounds that change as adaptation proceeds (i.e. equivalent to
numerous separate implementations of our model of a single mutational step). They observe a

14

fascinating range of dynamics: some mutations appeared to have α moderately above 1, exhibiting
modest increases in frequency between generations, but achieved this outcome with different traits

16

(e.g. S113N on the HA190D225D background exhibited strong within-host selection and no
evident transmission advantage, while D265V showed weak within-host selection but its frequency

18

rises in transmission). Another mutation (I187T on the ‘Mut’ background) appeared to have
α  1 and exhibited strong selection at both scales; notably, this mutation is widespread in 17/17

20

human-derived isolates of the post-emergence 1918 virus, consistent with the successful and rapid
emergence our model would predict. Moncla et al. also present substantial evidence of cross-scale

22

conflict in selection, as one mutation (G225D on ‘Mut’ background) exhibited declining frequencies
within ferrets but rose to fixation in 2/2 transmission events, while numerous mutations in the

24

HA2 region rose in frequency within the host but were eliminated in transmission. Another study
examined a set of ‘gain-of-function’ mutations in H5N1 influenza in ferrets, and reported a slow

26

rise in frequency when the virus was passaged between ferrets by intranasal inoculation, then
rapid fixation of these mutations during airborne transmission [24]; the airborne transmission data

28

are consistent with strong between-host selection and a high α value (though we emphasize that

27

circulating H5N1 viruses required substantial modification to the favorable genetic background
2

used in those experiments). Intriguingly, Moncla et al. synthesized their results with those of
earlier studies [41, 49, 62] to hypothesize that the ‘stringency’ of the transmission bottleneck

4

varies systematically during the course of viral adaptation, with loose bottlenecks prevailing when
viruses first encounter a new host species (and perhaps again when the virus is host-adapted), and

6

much tighter bottlenecks at the key juncture in host adaptation when a genotype with greater
transmissibility is available to be selected. If this hypothesis is correct, then our findings can be

8

applied to each adaptive step independently, and may help to identify which viral traits are most
crucial to adaptive steps subject to tighter or looser bottlenecks.

10

Our results focus on systems where there is one major rate-limiting step to emergence, and the
viral population can be represented by one wild-type and one mutant strain. This is a

12

simplification of most viral emergence problems, but will apply directly to systems where a single
large-effect mutation is the primary barrier to emergence of a supercritical strain, as for

14

Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus emerging from rodents to horses [101]. While it is possible to
extend our exact computations and analysis of the cross-scale reproductive number to systems

16

with multiple mutational steps, the present analysis already provides insights into more complex
evolutionary scenarios. For evolutionary trajectories that proceed through a fixed series of

18

genotypes, the probability of emergence can be approximated by extension of our equation (4), as
in previous work [12, 13, 15]. If emergence requires multiple mutational steps which pass through

20

a fitness valley, then the scale at which this valley occurs matters. A within-host fitness valley in
replication rates would hinder pathogens with long-term infections and larger bottleneck widths,

22

more than those with smaller bottlenecks. A between-host fitness valley in transmissibility could
hinder evolutionary emergence of pathogens causing long-term infections more than those causing

24

short-term infections, unless the within-host landscape is sufficiently favorable to allow traversing
the valley within a single host’s long-term infection. Recent studies have also highlighted the

26

importance of considering the broader genotype space, which can reveal indirect paths that
circumvent fitness valleys [102], alternative genotypes that yield similar phenotypes [43], and the

28

costs imposed by deleterious mutants on higher mutation rates [103].

28

Our analysis also focuses on a simple “logistic-like” model for within-host viral dynamics. This
2

simplification allows us to study how evolutionary emergence is limited by different factors for
pathogens dominated by exponential versus saturated phases of viral growth, while maintaining

4

analytical tractability. Future important extensions would be to allow within-host fitness to alter
the carrying capacity in the saturated phase, as well as identifying the relative contributions of

6

stochastic within-host dynamics [17], immune responses, and host heterogeneity on viral
emergence. Some of these aims would be addressed by using a more mechanistic model for the

8

within-host dynamics, incorporating resource limitation [72, 73] or immune pressure [104]. We
have assumed that the bottleneck width N is fixed for a given pathogen. This is broadly

10

consistent with currently available data [44, 47, 48], but it will be important to explore the
consequences of variation in bottleneck width arising from different routes of transmission, or

12

possibly from changing viral loads [38, 39]. The computational and analytical framework
developed here can be extended to account for these additional complexities. Other important

14

extensions can explore the impact of clonal competition on emergence probabilities [105–108] or
the potential for complementation to rescue pathogen strains from deep fitness valleys–a

16

mechanism that depends on wide transmission bottlenecks [109].
Our cross-scale analysis opens the door for a new generation of integrative risk assessment

18

models for pathogen emergence, which will integrate growing streams of data collected in
laboratories and field surveillance programs [97, 98, 100]. At present we rely on the intuition of

20

individual scientists to link together the discoveries from targeted experiments, massively parallel
phenotypic screens, experimental evolution, clinical medicine, and field epidemiology and disease

22

ecology. Mathematical and computational models that connect biological scales using mechanistic
principles can make unique contributions to this transdisciplinary enterprise, by formally

24

integrating diverse empirical findings and by identifying the crucial knowledge gaps to focus future
research. The work presented here is a step on the path to realizing this potential.

Derivation of the Single Strain Reproductive Numbers. When the within-host dynamics
only exhibit exponential growth (i.e. N exp(ri T ) < K) and there is a linear transmission function,

4

the basic reproductive numbers equal
(A–1)

Ri = βbi N

exp(ri T ) − 1
for i = w, m.

When the within-host dynamics saturate (i.e. N exp(ri T ) > K), the basic reproductive number

where Te = log(K/N )/ri is the length of exponential phase and Ts = T − Te is the length of
8

saturated phase. These expressions for the single strain reproductive numbers are equivalent to
evaluating the integral presented in equation (22) of Coombs et al. [73] for our within-host model.

10

We also note that our assumption of small mutation rates and Rw < Rm implies that the
multiscale reproductive number R0 in the sense of Coombs et al. [73] and Lythgoe et al. [65] (i.e.

12

the dominant eigenvalue of the next generation matrix of DG(1, 1, . . . , 1) is (approximately) Rm .
We derive two approximations of Ri under the assumption that s is small, exp(ri T )  1, and

14

K  N . First, assume that the infection is short-term in which case Te = T . Then provided s is
sufficiently small to ensure that the mutant type doesn’t saturate, Ri are given by (A–1). The log

ratio, provided exp(ri T )  1, satisfies

which yields (2) in the main text.

Now assume that the infection is long-term in which case Te < T , and that if s < 0, |s| is
sufficiently small to ensure that the mutant type also saturates before time T . Then the basic

Derivation of the Emergence Probability Approximation. For small mutation likelihood
µ, we derive a mathematically explicit version of the approximation (4) for the emergence

10

probability from the main text. As stated in the main text, this approximation is given by the
product of three terms: the expected number of secondary, wild-type cases produced during a

12

fade-out, the mean number of individuals infected with mutant virions by an individual initially
infected only with the wild-type, and the probability of emergence from an individual infected

14

with a single mutant virion. As noted in the main text, the first term is given by

1
.
1−Rw

The

second term requires more work. To derive an analytic approximation for this term, notice that

where vw (t), vm (t) is the solution of the within host viral dynamics with vw (0) = N, vm (0) = 0,
and ψ((vw , vm ), (ṽw , ṽm )) is the probability of an individual with viral load (vw , vm ) infecting an

4

individual with a viral load of (ṽw , ṽm ) where ṽw + ṽm = N . The solution (vm (t), vm (t)) is given by
vi (t) = Vi (t) if Vw (t) + Vm (t) ≤ K and K

otherwise
Vw (t) + Vm (t)

where Vw (t), Vm (t) are the solutions to

6

Vw (0) = N
Vm (0) = 0.

Ignoring back mutations (i.e. setting rm µ = 0 and rm (1 − µ) to rm ), the solutions for Vw (t), Vm (t)
are approximately
Vw (t) ≈ N exp(rw t)
Vm (t) ≈ µN

Appendix-4

For ` ≥ 2, these terms are of order µ2 and therefore will be ignored. Hence, the only term of

interest is ` = 1:

We also can approximate (assuming p is differentiable)
p(bw Vw (t) + bm Vm (t)) ≈ p(bw Vw (t)) + O(µ) = p(bw min{K, N exp(rw t)}) + O(µ)

We drop the O(µ) term as it will only lead to higher order terms in the approximation.

becomes the product of

(A–5) (respectively (A–6)), and the probability of an outbreak

starting with one individual infected with N − 1 wild type virions and 1 mutant type virions. The
final probability term can be calculated exactly using the generating functions described in the

12

Models and Methods section of the main text. Fig Appendix–6 illustrates the effectiveness of this
approximation, and Fig Appendix–7 plots the the error in the approximation.

14

Derivation of the Mean Field Frequency Dynamics. To understand how the viral
composition of infected individuals change across generations, we derive a mean field

16

approximation for the dynamics of the mean mutant viral load at the beginning of each generation
of disease spread. To this end, we define a map from h : [0, 1] → [0, 1] where x ∈ [0, 1] represents

18

the current mean mutant viral load in the population at the beginning of the infectious period and
h(x) is the mean at the beginning of infectious period in the next generation. Our derivation of

20

this mean field dynamic is done in the limit of large N ↑ ∞ and µ ↓ 0. None-the-less, as shown by
the dashed red line in Fig 2D, this approximation works quite well away from this limit.

Appendix-6

We begin by approximating the mean initial mutant viral count in individuals infected by an
2

individual with Vw (0) = N − ` and Vm (0) = `. Recall, the force of infection for producing
individuals initially infected with j mutant viral particles is given by

(N − j)!j!

is the within-host frequency of the mutant strain, and (vw (t), vm (t)) is

the solution of the within-host viral dynamics with initial condition vw (0) = N − `, vm (0) = `.
6

Weighting this term by j and summing over j yields the expected number of mutant viral
particles in an individual infected by our type (N − `, `) infected individual:

Now if we let x = `/N denote the initial fraction, then dividing the previous integral by the net

for N  1. h0 (0) corresponds to α described in the main text and the final expression has the

Carrying out the integration, in general, is complicated by the fact that the time at which
6

Vw (t) + Vm (t) = K has no explicit formula when s 6= 0 and, in general, this saturation time will
depend on x.

In the special case of short-term infections (i.e. there is only exponential growth), we get
h(x) =

where

α is defined as h0 (0), which here is equal to η, thus for short-term infections, α = Rm /Rw .
Since Rw < 1 by assumption and Rm > 1 is necessary for emergence, we always have α > 1 and

12

so the frequency dependent dynamics at the scale of the host population can not significantly
impede emergence.

14

Now, lets consider the more difficult case of a long-term infection with a saturated phase to the
within-host viral dynamics. Then

Estimating the Probability of Emergence when α < 1. When α is less than 1, the
frequency of mutant virus decrease in an infected host, and consequently, even if the adapted virus

8

may emerge, the probability of emergence is very low, and even lower when the bottleneck size, N ,
increases. Here, we provide an approximation for the emergence probability when α < 1, which

10

explains why the probability of emergence decreases dramatically when N increases.
When the outbreak starts, the first individual is infected with wild-type only. When s < 0, the

12

mutation-selection balance can be reached relatively quickly, and for s negative enough, the
proportion of mutant is small. So the probability to transmit at least one mutant is roughly equal

14

to the probability to transmit one mutant, which is N exp(τ )rw µ/|s| where rw µ/|s| is the
proportion of the mutant type, and exp(τ ) is its relative transmissibility. Then, if s is small

16

enough, then the reproductive number of an individual with a mixed transmission is close to Rw
of the wild-type. Thus, the number of transmissions in a wild-type outbreak can be used

18

(Rw /(1 − Rw )). For an individual infected with a mixed infection, what will lead to emergence are
the contacts for which only the mutant is transmitted. The number of such contacts is:

As most cases of mixed infection will be cases started with a mix of one mutant and N − 1

Now we can ask, which parts of this expression depend on N ? The mutant reproductive
RT
number Rw = bw 0 min{K, N exp(rw t)}dt is independent from N , because we have chosen bw to
RT
keep Rw the same for all N values. Thus bw N/(N − 1) 0 min{K, (N − 1) exp(rw t)}dt is almost

4

independent from N . Therefore, most of the dependence of
RT
bw N/(N − 1) 0 min{K, (N − 1) exp(rw t)}f (t, N )dt with N stems from the dependence of f (t, N )

6

with N . Since a 7→ a/(1 + a) is an increasing function bounded above by 1 for positive a, the
expression
exp(τ + st)/(N − 1)/(1 + exp(τ + st)/(N − 1))

8

decreases when N increases. As N 7→ (a/(1 + a))N −1 is a decreasing function of N ≥ 1 for a > 0,
we get that the probability of emergence decreases at least exponentially with the bottleneck size,

10

as claimed in the main text. Fig Appendix-1 illustrates that these approximations work especially
when s is sufficiently negative.

Numerics with Nonlinear Transmission Functions
To explore the robustness of our numerical results to the assumption of a linear transmission

14

function, we redid our numerical analysis with two non-linear transmission functions
p(x) = 1 − exp(−x) in Fig Appendix–2 and p(x) = log(1 + x) in Fig Appendix–4. Differences

16

between the emergence probabilities for the nonlinear and linear transmission functions are shown
in Figs Appendix–3 through 4. As these figures demonstrate, we nearly get the same results.
