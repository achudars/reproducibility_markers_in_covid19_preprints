Abstract:
The bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST) is a forebrain region highly sensitive to stress
that expresses corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neuropeptide at high levels and
regulates negative valence behaviors associated with anxiety. However, how chronic
stress modulates CRH signaling and neuronal activity in BNST remains unknown. We
subjected C57BL6/J mice to a 6-week chronic variable mild stress (CVMS) paradigm and
investigated the effects on behavior, BNST cellular neurophysiology, and BNST CRH
signaling. We also utilized pharmacological infusions and optogenetics to decipher and
mimic the effects of CVMS on BNST cellular neurophysiology and behavior. CVMS
elevated plasma corticosterone levels, induced negative valence behaviors associated
with anxiety, diminished M-currents (voltage-gated K+ currents that stabilize membrane
potential and regulate neuronal excitability), and increased mEPSC amplitude in ovBNST.
Additionally, the number of c-fos+, CRH+, and CRH activator pituitary adenylate
cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP)+ cells were increased while CRH inhibitor
striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (STEP)+ cells were decreased in ovBNST.
These expression data were confirmed with qPCR. CVMS also activated PKA in BNST and
the electrophysiological and behavioral effects of CVMS were reversed by ovBNST
infusion of the PKA-selective antagonist H89. Moreover, optogenetic activation of
ovBNST directly induced negative valence behaviors associated with anxiety, mimicking
the effects of CVMS. CVMS mediates effects on negative valence behaviors associated
with anxiety by activating CRH signaling components and cellular excitability in ovBNST.
Our findings decipher an important CRH-associated stress molecular signature in BNST
and advance our understanding of the neural circuitry underlying stress-induced
disorders.

Introduction:

Stressful environments promote vigilance, which, when moderate, is adaptive and
essential for survival. However, chronic exposure to stressful experiences or
environments can be maladaptive and increase risk assessment of low imminence
threats, which is a feature of persistent anxiety. The limbic forebrain structure bed
nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is critical for mediating the neuroendocrine stress
response (1) and potential threat regulation (2-5). Overall, BNST integrates stress and
reward information from the limbic system and projects to neuroendocrine and
autonomic neural systems located in the hypothalamus and brain stem regions that
mediate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress response (3, 5, 6). Stimulating
BNST elicits anxiogenic responses (7), whereas BNST inactivation is anxiolytic (8, 9).
Consequently, BNST dysfunction contributes to exaggerated stress responses and
stress-related mood disorders.
The stress hormone corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH or CRF) is abundantly
expressed in hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) parvocellular neurons. These
PVN CRH neurons regulate HPA axis activity (10) and cortisol release (11-13). Importantly,
CRH is also highly expressed in BNST (5, 14-18), especially in the oval nucleus (19). CRH
mRNA in the antero-dorsolateral BNST (BNSTadl) is increased by stress exposure (20).
Furthermore, anterolateral BNST (BNSTALG) stimulation increases corticosterone release
(6, 21). Notably, BNST orchestrates stress responses in a CRH-dependent fashion (22).
CRH neurons in BNSTadl mediate anxiogenic effects (19, 23, 24) and negative affective
responses to stress (25-28). CRH injections into BNST and CRH overexpression in BNST
cause anxiogenic effects (26) and result in increased negative valence behaviors
associated with anxiety (29, 30). Therefore, CRH dysfunction in BNST likely contributes to
stress-related behavioral states (31) and mood disorders (32).
BNST is a complex conglomerate structure with a heterogeneous population of
neurons (19, 33-35). Within BNSTALG, the highest concentration of CRH neurons is

located in the oval nucleus (14, 19, 36) (ovBNST). ovBNST is thought to be a master
controller of BNST outflow that regulates overall BNST activity (3). Optogenetic
inhibition of ovBNST deceases, whereas stimulation promotes negative valence
behaviors (37). Here, we utilize a chronic variable mild stress (CVMS; also known as
chronic unpredictable mild stress) paradigm in mice to better understand the effects of
chronic stress on BNST. CVMS and other chronic stress paradigms are widely used to
determine the neuroendocrine and physiological effects that result in behavioral
disturbances in stress-related mood disorders (38) (39). However, little is known about
how chronic stress modulates the expression of CRH signaling components and cellular
neurophysiology properties in the BNST and whether these alterations underlie chronic
stress effects on behavior. Here we demonstrate that CVMS modulates expression of
CRH-related stress signaling components (including its upstream activator, pituitary
adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) as well as its inhibitor, striatal-enriched
protein tyrosine phosphatase (STEP)) and neuronal activity as measured by both
M-currents (a voltage-dependent non-inactivating K+ current that stabilizes cellular
membrane potential) and miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in mouse
ovBNST. Furthermore, we show that selective inhibition of PKA (a downstream
modulator of CRH signaling) in ovBNST reverses CVMS effects on M-currents, mEPSCs,
and behavior. Furthermore, optogenetic activation of ovBNST mimics CVMS effects on
behavior. Taken together, these data suggest that the effects of CVMS on negative
valence behaviors associated with anxiety are mediated through altered CRH signaling
and neuronal activity in ovBNST.

METHODS AND MATERIALS:
Mice:
All procedures were in accordance with institutional guidelines based on the
National Institutes of Health standards and approved by the Rutgers Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee. All mice used (except for optogenetics) were adult male
C57BL/6J mice purchased from Jackson. For optogenetics, dopamine receptor D1a
(Drd1a)-Cre (GENSAT line EY266) transgenic mice were generated from in house
breeding.
Except for CVMS exposure, all mice were maintained in a controlled temperature
(22°C) and a 12 h light/dark cycle with food and water provided ad libitum.

Chronic variable mild stress (CVMS):
CVMS was performed as described (40, 41). CVMS began when mice were 6 weeks
old and persisted for 6 weeks. 50 mice were randomly assigned to non-stress (Control)
(n=25) or CVMS groups (n=25). Variable mild stressors were used: daily bedding
alterations (repeated sawdust changes, removal of sawdust, damp sawdust, substitution
of sawdust with 21 °C water), cage-tilting (45° angle), predator sounds (15 min), cage
shift (placed into the empty cage of another male), alterations of the light/dark cycle,
lights off for 180 min, overnight food/water deprivation (40, 41).
50 total mice were used in 3 sets of experiments. 20 were used for behavior (n=10
per group) and subsequent immunohistochemistry (IHC) (randomly selected n=6 per
group), 12 for electrophysiology (n=6 per group), and 18 for plasma CORT measurements
(n=7-9 per group) and real-time quantitative PCR analysis (q-PCR) (n=7-9 per group).

Data Analysis:
All data are presented as mean±SEM. Statistical analysis were conducted with
GraphPad Prism (La Jolla, CA). Comparisons of M-current I-V plots between Control and

Stress group were performed at each voltage (–25 to –75 mV) using a one-way ANOVA
with posthoc Newman-Keuls comparisons. Maximum current at –35 mV was analyzed
with paired Student’s t-test. For mEPSCs, amplitude and frequency were analyzed
off-line using Mini Analysis (Synaptosoft, Fort Lee, NJ). mEPSC amplitude and frequency
comparisons were performed using paired Student’s t-test. For behavior, IHC, and
plasma CORT concentration comparisons between Control and CVMS groups, data were
analyzed with a one-way ANOVA and posthoc Tukey comparisons. For optogenetics
behavior experiments, data were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA with posthoc Tukey
comparisons, with light and group as independent factors.
Differences were considered significant when p<0.05. n represents the number of
cells or animals.

RESULTS
We first exposed a cohort of male C57BL6/J mice to either chronic variable mild
stress (CVMS) or control conditions. CVMS began when mice were 6 weeks old and the
paradigm persisted for 6 weeks (Fig.1A). 6 weeks of CVMS resulted in a significant
percent decrease in body weight compared with non-stress controls (F(1,13)=84.908,
p<0.001). We next sampled blood plasma and found significantly higher basal CORT
levels in the CVMS group relative to the control group (F(1,18)=12.281, p<0.01) (Fig.S1).
We next assessed behaviors that are influenced by chronic stress exposure. Mice
exposed to CVMS showed decreased open arm duration in elevated plus maze (EPM)
(F(1,18)=8.262; p=0.01; Fig.1B), decreased sucrose preference in sucrose preference test
(SPT) (F(1,18)=23.118; p<0.001; Fig.1D), decreased center distance (F(1,18)=30.155;
p<0.001; Fig.1E), center duration (F(1,18)=59.24; p<0.001; Fig.1F), and center entries
(F(1,18)=19.50; p=0.001; Fig.1G) in open field (OF), and increased latency to eat in
novelty suppressed feeding (NSF) (F(1,18)=10.460; p<0.01; Fig.1H) relative to non-stress
controls. EPM open arm entries (F(1,18)=2.065; p=0.17; Fig.1C) and forced swim test
(FST) immobility (F(1,18)=3.035; p=0.08; Fig.1I) were not significantly affected by CVMS.
Taken together, these data demonstrate that our CVMS protocol effectively induces
negative valence behaviors associated with anxiety in EPM, OF, and NSF, and decreases
reward valuation in the anhedonia-related SPT.
Next, we determined the effects of CVMS on ovBNST electrophysiological
properties using ex vivo slices (Fig.2A). We first measured M-currents (KCNQ/Kv7
channels), a subthreshold noninactivating voltage-dependent outward K+ current that
controls action potential generation and neuronal excitability (42), in ovBNST neurons
using a standard deactivation-activation protocol over a voltage range (–75 to –25 mV)
where M-currents have profound effects on neuronal excitability (Fig.2C). M-currents
were calculated by determining current relaxation, the difference between the
instantaneous and steady states (Fig.3C arrows). The maximum M-currents were

recorded at –35 mV (Fig.2B). 20 min of recording did not show a M-current rundown
(amplitude decrease) (example traces in Fig.2B; n=5). Application of the KCNQ/Kv7
channel blocker XE991 robustly decreased M-currents (Fig.2B). We next determined the
role of M-currents in modulating BNST neuronal excitability. To this end, firing activity of
ovBNST neurons was continuously monitored in current clamp mode (Fig.2D). XE991
application induced action potentials after 30 s, and 6-7 min of XE991 perfusion led to
robust firing bursts indicative of activation and hyperexcitability (Fig.2D).
Interestingly, the outward M-current was attenuated in ovBNST neurons from CVMS
mice (Fig.2E), especially at higher voltages (p=0.005, 0.003, 0.001, 0.004, 0.003, and
0.005 at –50, –45, –40, –35, –30 and -25 mV, respectively; n=6), with a significant effect
of stress (F(1,10)=16.353, p=0.002). At –35 mV, the outward M-current peak value was
robustly decreased from 202.59±39.95 pA in control to 42.90±16.54 pA (t=3.693;
p=0.004) in CVMS slices. Furthermore, CVMS significantly depolarized the resting
membrane potential (RMP) (t=3.192, p=0.023) (Fig.2F) and increased the input
resistance (Rin) (t=3.632, p=0.014) (Fig.2G) in ovBNST neurons.
Reduced M-currents can elicit increased excitatory cellular responses to synaptic
inputs (43). Therefore, we hypothesized that CVMS may alter excitatory glutamatergic
neurotransmission in ovBNST. Indeed, CVMS significantly increased the average
amplitude of mEPSCs (Fig.2H-J) (t=3.141, p=0.012) without affecting mEPSC frequency
(t=0.790, p=0.451 (Fig.2J). Taken together, these data demonstrate that CVMS
contributes to increased excitability and hyperactivation of ovBNST neurons.
Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), a neuropeptide that is released from the
paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus (PVN) in response to stress, is also
highly expressed in BNST (Fig.3.1A). Therefore, we next assessed CVMS effects on CRH
signaling in BNST. To this end, we subdivided anterior-dorsolateral BNST (BNSTadl) into
the oval nucleus of BNST (ovBNST) and the surrounding anterolateral dorsal region of
BNST (adBNST) (Fig.S4E). CVMS increased the number of CRH+ cells in BNSTadl and

ovBNST relative to control (BNSTadl: F(1,10)=49.78, p<0.01; ovBNST: F(1,10)=28.93;
p<0.01) (Fig.3.2C-D). However, the number of CRH+ cells in adBNST did not differ
between CVMS and control (Fig.S4.2A).
We next assessed c-fos in the BNST of control and CVMS mice as a marker of
neuronal

activation

(c-fos+

cell

example

in

Fig.3.1B).

The

number

of

c-fos-immunoreactive cells in BNSTadl and ovBNST were significantly increased by CVMS
(BNSTadl: F(1,10)=24.896, p<0.01; ovBNST: F(1,10)=65.29, p<0.001) (Fig.3.2A-B).
However, c-fos+ cells were unchanged by CVMS in the adBNST region (Fig.S4.2B).
Consistent with these data, the CRH activator pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating
polypeptide (PACAP) (Fig.3.1C), was more highly expressed in BNSTadl and ovBNST after
CVMS, while the CRH inhibitor striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (STEP)
(Fig.3.1D), was decreased in BNSTadl and ovBNST of CVMS mice (PACAP BNSTadl:
F(1,10)=77.89, p<0.01; PACAP ovBNST: F(1,10)=98.36, p<0.001 (shown in Fig.3.2.E and
F)); STEP BNSTadl: F(1,8)=16.063, p<0.01; STEP ovBNST: F(1,8)=20.099, p<0.01)
(Fig.3.2G-H). However, the number of PACAP+ and STEP+ cells in adBNST was unchanged
by CVMS (Fig.S4C-D). Taken together, these data demonstrate that CRH signaling is
increased in BNSTadl and ovBNST by CVMS.
To complement these immunohistochemistry results, we next assessed mRNA
expression of CRH, PACAP, STEP, and the CRH receptors CRHR1 and CRHR2 in BNSTadl by
qPCR (Fig.4A). CVMS significantly increased CRH (F(1,14)=6.303, p=0.018; Fig.4B) and
PACAP (F(1,12)=5.597, p=0.037; Fig.4C) and decreased STEP (F(1,16)=5.877, p=0.031;
Fig.4D) expression in BNSTadl relative to non-stress controls. Interestingly, CRHR1
expression was also significantly increased in CVMS mice (F(1,15)=4.985, p=0.041;
Fig.4E), whereas CRHR2 was unchanged (F(1,14)=0.750, p=0.403; Fig.4F). CVMS did not
affect KCNQ2, KCNQ3, and KCNQ5 subunit (the Kv7 M-channel components) expression
(Fig.S2). Since these qPCR results suggest that CRHR1 expression is selectively increased
in the BNST by CVMS, and CRHR1 is a Gs protein-coupled receptor linked to adenylyl

cyclase (AC), we next assessed whether CVMS resulted in protein kinase A (PKA)
activation in BNST. To this end, we assessed protein expression levels of PKA (using an
antibody recognizing the PKA subunit C-α) and its activated form p-PKA (using an
antibody recognizing Thr197 phosphorylated-PKA-C; Fig.4G) in BNSTadl tissue punches
from CVMS and control mice by western blot. While total PKA levels did not differ
(t=1.46, p=0.171) (Fig.4I), p-PKA expression in BNSTadl was increased by CVMS (t test
t=5.105, p=0.0003) (Fig.4J), indicating CVMS increases PKA activation in BNSTadl.
We also assessed STEP protein expression in BNSTadl tissue punches (Fig.4H).
Whereas the membrane isoform STEP61 did not differ (t=1.060, p=0.31) (Fig.4L), CVMS
decreased expression of the cytosolic isoform STEP46 in BNSTadl was decreased in CVMS
mice (t=2.292, p=0.026) (Fig.4K), suggesting CVMS specifically affects cytosolic STEP46
expression in BNST.
We next assessed whether BNST PKA activation mediates the effects of CVMS on
M-currents and mEPSCs. When ex vivo brain slices were pre-incubated with the selective
PKA antagonist H89 for 30 min, the CVMS-induced decrease in ovBNST outward
M-currents was significantly attenuated at higher voltages (F(1,10)=16.353, p=0.002;
Fig.5A) (p=0.044, 0.045, 0.047, 0.042 and 0.020 at–45, –40, –35, –30 and -25 mV,
respectively). At –40 mV, the outward M-current peak value was increased (t=2.292,
p=0.045) in CVMS slices pre-incubated with H89 compared with CVMS slices (Fig.5A).
Similarly, the CVMS-induced mEPSC amplitude increase in ovBNST was significantly
decreased (t=2.913, p=0.025) when slices were preincubated with the selective PKA
antagonist H89 for 30 min (Fig.5B). By contrast, mEPSC frequency in ovBNST was not
different between CVMS and CVMS+H89 slices (t=0.210; p=0.843) (Fig.5C). Importantly,
H89 pre-incubation had no significant effects on ovBNST M-currents and mEPSCs in
control slices (Fig.S8). Taken together, these results suggest that the effects of CMVS on
M-currents and mEPSC amplitude in ovBNST are mediated by PKA activation.
Next, we examined whether PKA activation also mediates the behavioral effects of

(F(1,19)=4.43; p=0.035; Fig.6H), and decreased NSF latency to eat (F(1,19)=4.434;
p=0.025) (Fig.6I) relative to control infusions into CVMS mice. H89 did not affect EPM
open arm entries in CVMS mice (F(1,14)=1.212; p=0.374; Fig.6D). Importantly, H89
infusions into BNST had no effects in EPM, SPT, OF, or NSF in control mice (Fig.S9). Taken
together, these results demonstrate that CVMS effects on negative valence behaviors
associated with anxiety in tasks such as EPM, OF, and NSF and reward valuation in the
anhedonia-related SPT are mediated by ovBNST PKA activation.
Since our data demonstrate that CVMS decreases M-currents and increases mEPSC
amplitude in BNST, we next sought to determine whether selective activation of ovBNST
mimics the behavioral effects of CVMS. To this end, we injected either a Cre-inducible
ChR2 (AAV5-EF1α-DIO-ChR2(H134R)-eYFP) or control virus (AAV5-EF1α-DIO-eYFP) into
BNST of dopamine receptor D1a (Drd1a)-Cre transgenic mice (Fig.7A). Within BNST, Cre
expression in Drd1a-Cre mice is restricted to ovBNST (37). Fig.7B-C shows expression of
Control-eYFP (B) and ChR2-eYFP virus (C) in ovBNST. Similar to a previous report (Kim et
al 2013), ChR2 photoillumination in ovBNST resulted in a significant virus x light
interaction for EPM open arm duration and entries (Fig.7D-E), (Duration: F(2,42)=3.277,
p=0.048; Entries: F(2,48)=8.746, p=0.001). Specifically, ovBNST activation (light ON
period) decreased open arm duration and entries relative to the preceding (Duration:
p<0.01; Fig.7D; Entries: p<0.01; Fig.7E) and succeeding (Duration: p=0.018; Entries:
p<0.01) light OFF periods. By contrast, there were no significant changes in open arm
duration or entries across the light OFF/ON/OFF periods in mice injected with control
virus. Similarly, in OF, ChR2 photoillumination in ovBNST resulted in a significant virus x

light interaction for center distance (Fig.7F), center duration (Fig.7G), and center entries
(Fig.7H) (Distance: F(2,39)=6.853, p=0.003; Duration: F(2,39)=4.72, p=0.015; Entries:
F(2,36)=11.495, p<0.001). Specifically, ovBNST activation decreased these OF center
measures relative to the preceding (p<0.01 for all center measures) and succeeding
(p<0.01 for all center measures) light OFF periods (Fig.7F-H). By contrast, there were no
changes in center measures across the light OFF/ON/OFF periods in mice injected with
control virus. Taken together, these data demonstrate that selective activation of ovBNST
neurons mimics the behavioral effects of CVMS and that ovBNST activation is sufficient
to induce negative valence behaviors.

DISCUSSION

Chronic stress results in long-term alterations in HPA axis activity and negative
valence behaviors associated with anxiety (44-47). However, the neurobiological
underpinnings remain elusive. BNST plays an important role in mediating sustained
negative valence behaviors in rodents (8, 48, 49) and mood disorders in humans (50-54),
and BNST dysfunction is implicated in stress-related psychopathology (2-4). Importantly,
our data demonstrate that CVMS alters expression of CRH-related stress signaling
components (including PACAP, STEP, and CRHR1) and enhances cellular excitability
(manifested by decreased M-current and increased mEPSC amplitude) in ovBNST
neurons. These CVMS-induced alterations result in BNST dysfunction, which in turn
contributes to negative valence behavioral disturbances associated with anxiety. Direct
optogenetic activation of ovBNST neurons mimics behavioral effects of CVMS, further
suggesting

that

BNST

dysfunction

may

underlie

CVMS-mediated

behavioral

disturbances.
The CVMS paradigm is well validated to elicit negative valence behaviors. Whereas
chronic exposure to homotypic stressors usually engenders HPA habituation (55-58), this
shortcoming is circumvented by the CVMS paradigm, in which rodents were exposed to
randomly alternating stressors in an unpredictable manner (59). In this study, a robust
behavioral phenotype and elevated plasma corticosterone levels were found after a
6-week CVMS exposure. It will be informative for future studies to determine whether
other chronic stress paradigms, such as chronic social defeat stress, elicit similar effects
on ovBNST.

M-current and mEPSC regulation by CVMS
The M-current is a subthreshold voltage-dependent non-inactivating outward K+
current that stabilizes membrane potential and sets cellular threshold for action
potential firing (60, 61). M-channels are composed of Kv7 subunits (KCNQ) (62), open at

resting membrane potential, and undergo conformational changes that facilitate even
more opening during depolarization, which results in membrane potential clamping.
Therefore, M-currents function as a brake on repetitive action potential charges (62) and
play an essential role in controlling neuronal excitability (63). Diminished M-currents
allow neurons to fire more rapidly (61), as evidenced during XE991 (M-channel selective
blocker) perfusion. Our results show that CVMS-induced decreased M-currents in
ovBNST are accompanied by a more depolarized cellular resting membrane potential
(Fig.2F), indicating enhanced neuronal excitability. Acute restraint suppresses M-currents
and increases cellular activity in CRH neurons in the hypothalamic PVN, which may
contribute to HPA hyperactivation after acute stress (64). However, whether chronic
stress modulates M-currents was previously unknown. Our study provides a direct
cellular mechanism by which CVMS increases excitability of ovBNST neurons.
Consequently, targeting ovBNST M-channels may provide a potential therapeutic
strategy to treat stress-related mood disorders (65).
Our qPCR results revealed no significant changes in KCNQ subunit mRNA expression
after CVMS (Fig.S2), so post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may
account for M-current inhibition. We found that CVMS effects on M-currents are
mediated in part through post-translational PKA activation (Fig.4J). Although few studies
have assessed direct regulation of KCNQ channel activity by PKA, M-currents can be
inhibited by phosphorylation (15). Anchoring proteins, such as members of the A-kinase
anchoring protein family (AKAP), may bind to and localize activated PKA into a
membrane signaling complex near the KCNQ channel subunit in order to modulate
channel function (17) (66). Similarly, increased amplitude (but not frequency) of mEPSCs
after CVMS suggests a postsynaptic effect, such as PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the
GluR1 subunit of AMPA receptors (24, 67). GluR1 phosphorylation is closely correlated
with increased receptor surface trafficking and membrane redistribution (68, 69), and
increased AMPA receptor density on postsynaptic membranes would increase mEPSC

amplitude (reflecting increased synaptic responses) (70-72).

CVMS-induced alterations in BNST CRH signaling
Although hypothalamic CRH signaling was not assessed here, previous studies show
PVN CRH neuron activation (73) and increased PVN CRH expression in rats exposed to
CVMS (74). In BNST, CRH signaling is linked to negative affective states (25, 26, 75-78).
Increased CRH concentrations (79, 80) and mRNA levels (20, 81) are found in rat BNST
after chronic stress, however whether chronic stress modulates CRH neuropeptides in
mouse BNST was unknown. Notably, the oval nuclei in the BNSTALG, which resides dorsal
to the anterior commissure (19), harbors the highest concentration of CRH neurons in
BNST (14, 36). Local CRH signaling in ovBNST is suggested to be stress responsive (28, 35,
82). Importantly, we also compared CRH expression in the anterodorsal BNST region
(adBNST) surrounding ovBNST. Interestingly, CVMS selectively increases the number of
CRH-immunopositive cells in ovBNST (with no changes in adBNST). In addition, CVMS
selectively increases CRHR1 mRNA expression in BNSTadl, suggesting the effects of CRH
are mediated mainly through this receptor. This is consistent with recent studies
demonstrating stress effects on behavior depend on CRHR1 receptor activation (22) and
are blocked by CRHR1 antagonist injections into BNST (25, 26). CRHR1 and CRHR2
subtypes play opposing roles during the stress response (44, 47), as CRHR1 activation
initiates the stress response and results in negative valence behaviors (25, 26, 83-85),
whereas CRHR2 activation in the BNST mainly functions to terminate the stress response
and facilitate stress recovery (86, 87). Thus, exaggerated CRHR1 expression and a
disruption in the expression balance of these two receptors may dampen stress-coping
capability and precipitate stress-related psychopathology.
We also assessed the effects of CVMS on pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating
polypeptide (PACAP) and striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (STEP). PACAP is
a key stress regulator (88-90) that is upstream of CRH and stimulates CRH production

and secretion (91). PACAP dysregulation is implicated in depression (92) and PTSD in
humans (93). PACAP is highly expressed in BNST and PACAP-containing neurons in
ovBNST closely interact with CRH-containing neurons as part of the stress response.
Chronic stress increases PACAP expression in the dorsal BNSTALG (81, 94), and PACAP
infusion into BNST increases plasma corticosterone concentrations (95). Treatment with
a PAC1 receptor antagonist attenuates behavioral and endocrine effects of stress (94).
We found that increased CRH and CRHR1 levels were accompanied by increased PACAP
expression in ovBNST following CVMS. We also investigated the effects of CVMS on STEP
(also known as protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 5, PTPN5). STEP is a
brain-specific tyrosine phosphatase that dephosphorylates and inactivates several
kinases (including ERK1/2 and p38MAPK, Fyn) (96) and STEP overexpression enhances
stress resilience (97). Furthermore, STEP loss-of-function increases susceptibility to
stress-induced cognitive deficits (98). Downregulation of STEP expression in BNSTALG
after chronic stress may contribute to a prolonged negative affective state (28).
Importantly, in BNST, STEP is coexpressed in ovBNST CRH neurons and selectively buffers
CRH neurons against overactivation after stress (28). While CVMS resulted in increased
expression of CRH, CRHR1, and PACAP, STEP expression in BNSTALG was decreased. These
concomitant changes suggest that CVMS disrupts the delicate balance of CRH signaling
and results in hyperactivation of CRH neurons in the BNSTALG. Together, our data show
that CVMS causes disturbances in BNST CRH signaling that reflect a novel
stress-associated molecular signature.

Working Model
We propose that activation of CRHR1 in ovBNST by CRH stimulates Gs
protein-coupled adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity (99), which results in cAMP generation and
activation of cAMP-dependent PKA. PKA phosphorylates the KCNQ channel and the
GluR1 subunit of AMPA receptors, which mediate M-current inhibition (15) and

increased mEPSC amplitude (100, 101), respectively (Fig.8). CRH itself can also facilitate
glutamatergic transmission in many brain regions (102-104). Increased mEPSC amplitude
coupled with decreased M-currents contribute to hyperexcitation of ovBNST neurons
following chronic stress. In turn, hyperactive ovBNST neurons disrupt neural circuitry and
result in dysfunctional HPA axis activation through projections to PVN in the
hypothalamus.
Acute optogenetic activation mimicked the effects of CVMS on ovBNST neurons. In
these experiments, we utilized dopamine receptor D1a (Drd1a)-Cre transgenic mice
where, within BNST, Cre is selectively expressed in ovBNST neurons (19, 37, 105). Similar
to a previous report (Kim et al 2013), ChR2-mediated activation of ovBNST neurons
induced negative valence behaviors associated with anxiety. Such acute effects on
behavior are likely due to fast stimulatory release of local excitatory neurotransmitters,
such as CRH, which could act on the local BNST microcircuitry and through projections to
downstream regions such as PVN (6).

Conclusion
Maladaptive changes of BNST function underlie pathological anxiety disorders in
humans (3). Here we identified 1) a novel electrophysiological mechanism suggesting
CVMS activates ovBNST and 2) dysfunctional BNST CRH signaling represents a novel
chronic stress-associated molecular signature. Activation of ovBNST coupled with
neurochemical alterations in BNSTALG may result in disturbances that underlie
stress-related mood disorders. Electrophysiological and behavioral effects of CVMS were
reversed by ovBNST PKA inhibition. Furthermore, optogenetic activation of ovBNST
neurons mimicked the effects of CVMS by increasing negative valence behaviors
associated with anxiety. Taken together, these data suggest that ovBNST is a critical
component of the neural circuitry that underlies stress-induced mood disorders.

mice. Mice were allowed to undergo at least 3 weeks recovery before subjected to
either EPM or OF test (both composed of 3 different sessions of lights off-on-off
series) under blue light stimulation.

in ovBNST. Scale bar: 400 μm. Ic: internal capsule; ac: anterior commissure; ov: oval
nucleus.
(D): Comparison of the duration time that Control (n=8) mice vs. ChR2 (n=8) mice
spent in open arm during the OFF-ON-OFF session (each 5 min) in EPM test revealed
decreased open arm duration when blue light on only in the ChR2 group but not in
the Control group.
