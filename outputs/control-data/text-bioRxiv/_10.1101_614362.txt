Abstract

19

Ants are famous in the animal kingdom for their amazing load carriage performances. Yet, the

20

mechanisms that allow these insects to maintain their stability when carrying heavy loads

21

have been poorly investigated. Here we present a study of the kinematics of loaded

22

locomotion in the polymorphic seed-harvesting ant Messor barbarus. In this species big ants

23

have larger heads relative to their size than small ants. Hence, their center of mass is shifted

24

forward, and the more so when they are carrying a load in their mandibles. We tested the

25

hypothesis that this could lead to big ants being less statically stable than small ants, thus

26

explaining their lower load carriage performances. When walking unloaded we found that big

27

ants were indeed less statically stable than small ants but that they were nonetheless able to

28

adjust their stepping pattern to partly compensate for this instability. When ants were walking

29

loaded on the other hand, there was no evidence of different locomotor behaviors in

30

individuals of different sizes. Loaded ants, whatever their size, move too slowly to maintain

31

their balance through dynamic stability. Rather, they seem to do so by clinging to the ground

32

with their hind legs during part of a stride. We show through a straightforward model that

33

allometric relationships have a minor role in explaining the differences in load carriage

34

performances between big ants and small ants and that a simple scale effect is sufficient to

35

explain these differences.

Introduction

40

The locomotion of animals can be described as a succession of strides that follows a specific

41

inter-leg coordination pattern called gait (Alexander, 2003). In hexapod animals such as

42

insects the most common gait is the alternating tripod (Delcomyn, 1981), in which the animal

43

walks by alternating the movement of two distinct sets of legs (the ipsilateral front and hind

44

leg and the contralateral mid leg, e.g. L1, L3, R2 and R1, R3, L2 respectively, with L for left

45

and R for right), each of which forms a tripod supporting the body. In its ideal form, the two

46

tripods perfectly alternate: all the legs in one tripod group simultaneously lift-off while all the

47

legs of the other tripod group are still on the ground. However, depending on various features

48

of their locomotion, insects can also adopt more complex gait. For example, the pattern of leg

49

coordination can change with locomotory speed (Bender et al., 2011; Wosnitza et al., 2012;

50

Mendes et al., 2013; Wahl et al., 2015), walking curvature (Zolliköfer, 1994a) and direction

51

of movement, i.e. forward or backward movement (Pfeffer et al., 2016). Insects also adapt

52

their gait according to the features of the terrain on which they are moving, e.g. when they

53

walk on a non-level substrate (Seidl and Wehner, 2008; Reinhardt et al., 2009; Grabowska et

54

al., 2012; Ramdya et al., 2017; Wöhrl et al., 2017) or when they climb over obstacles (Watson

55

et al., 2002). Another factor that is known to have an effect on leg coordination during

56

locomotion in terrestrial vertebrates (Jagnandan and Higham, 2018) but that has been less

57

studied in insects is the change in the total mass an individual has to put in motion. Changes

58

in total mass can be progressive or sudden and can occur in a variety of situations. For

59

example, it happens in female insects during egg development and after oviposition,

60

autotomy, i.e. the voluntary shedding of a body segment (Fleming and Bateman, 2007; Lagos,

61

2017), or, in the most common case, when insects are transporting food, either internally, after

62

ingesting liquid, or externally, in their mandibles. In all these situations the change in total

63

mass induces a shift in the center of mass of the insect which can profoundly affect its

64

locomotion.

65

Ants offer a very good model to study the effect of changes in total mass on walking

66

kinematics for at least three reasons. First, they are famous for their load carriage

67

performances and can routinely carry loads (prey items, seeds, nest material, nestmates and

68

brood) weighing more than ten times their own mass over tens of meters (Bernadou et al.,

69

2016). In addition, the food they collect can be transported internally or externally. The shift

70

in their center of mass can thus vary both in intensity and direction, which is likely to disrupt

71

their walking kinematics in different ways. Second, due to the high number of species in their

72

taxon (Hölldober & Wilson, 1990), the size and shape of ant bodies is extremely variable,

73

which probably affects differently the kinematics of their locomotion. And third, ants live in

74

very diverse environments and can be subterranean, ground-living, or arboreal (Hölldobler

75

and Wilson, 1990), which is bound to constrain their movements and affect their locomotion

76

differently (Gravish et al., 2013; Seidl and Wehner, 2008; Reinhardt et al., 2009; Wöhrl et al.,

77

2017).

78

The effects of changes in total mass due to load carriage on the walking kinematics of ants

79

have been poorly explored in the ant literature. The main effect of carrying a load in the

80

mandibles is to induce a forward shift of the center of mass of the system formed by the ant

81

and the load they carry. However, according to Hughes (1952), insects could counter this

82

effect and achieve balanced locomotion by using static stability, i.e. by keeping the planar

83

projection of their center of mass within the polygon formed by the legs simultaneously in

84

contact with the ground (called polygon of support). In fact, this is what loaded ants do. For

85

example, Cataglyphis fortis workers ensure static stability by placing their front legs in a

86

more forward position when loaded than when unloaded and by reducing their stride length

87

(Zollikofer, 1994b). In the species Atta vollenweideri, whose foraging workers carry

88

elongated pieces of grass over their head, ants increase their mechanical stability by

89

increasing the number of legs simultaneously in contact with the ground. They do so by

90

increasing over consecutive steps the overlap between the stance (retraction) phase of the

91

supporting tripod and some of the legs of the other tripod (mostly the front leg) and by

92

dragging their hind legs during the swing (protraction) phase (Moll et al., 2013). These ants

93

also adjust the angle of the load they carry so that the planar projection of their center of mass

94

remains within the polygon of support (Moll et al., 2013).

95

In this paper, we studied the effect of load carriage on the walking kinematics of the seed-

96

harvesting ant Messor barbarus, an ant species that is characterized by a highly polymorphic

97

worker caste, i.e. a high variability in the size of individuals within the same colony. In

98

addition, this polymorphism is characterized by allometric relationships between the different

99

parts of the body (Bernadou et al., 2016), which means that big workers are not an enlarged

100

copy of small workers but that the growth of some of their body parts during development is

101

different from that of small workers (Bonner, 2006). In fact, relative to their mass their legs

102

are shorter and their head bigger than those of small workers. Here, we hypothesized that this

103

allometry could lead to differences in unloaded and/or loaded locomotion in different sized

104

workers and thus could explain the differences observed in their load carriage performances

105

(Bernadou et al., 2016). To test this, we ran an experiment in which we compared the

106

kinematics of workers tested first unloaded and then loaded with loads whose relative mass

107

we varied in a systematic way across different sized ants

108

Materials and methods

109

Studied species and rearing conditions

110

We used workers from a large colony of M. barbarus collected in April 2018 at St Hippolyte

111

(Pyrénées Orientales) on the French Mediterranean coast. Messor barbarus is a seed harvester

112

ant whose mature colonies can shelter several tens of thousands individuals (Cerdan, 1989).

113

Its workers display a polymorphism characterized by a continuous monophasic allometry

114

between head mass and thorax length (Heredia and Detrain, 2000; Bernadou et al., 2016).

115

Individuals range from 1 to 40 mg in mass and from 2 to 15 mm in length. The colony was

116

kept in a box (LxWxH: 0.50x0.30x0.15 m) with Fluon® coated walls to prevent ants from

117

escaping. Ants nested inside test tubes covered with opaque paper. They had access ad libitum

118

to water and to seeds of various species (canary grass, niger, oats). The experimental room

119

was kept at a constant temperature of 28°C and under a 12:12 L:D regime.

120

Experimental setup

121

The setup we used in our experiment was designed and built by a private company (R&D

122

Vision, France. http://www.rd-vision.com). It consisted in a walkway (160 x 25mm) covered

123

with a piece of black paper (Canson®, 160g/m2) on which the ants were walking during the

124

experiment. The walkway was surrounded by five synchronized high speed video cameras

125

(JAI GO-5000M-PMCL: frequency: 250Hz; resolution: 30µm/px for the top camera,

126

20µm/px for the others), one placed above the walkway and four placed on its sides (Figure

127

1). Four infrared spots (λ=850nm), synchronized with the cameras, were used to illuminate

128

the walkway from above, allowing a better contrast between the ants and the background on

129

the videos. The temperature on the walkway was monitored with an infrared thermometer

130

(MS pro, Optris, USA, http://www.optris.com). Over the course of the experiment the mean

131

temperature was (mean ± SD) 28 ± 1.4 °C.

132

Experimental protocol

133

All experiments were performed between April and July 2018.

134

On the first day of a week in which we tested ants, we installed a bridge between the colony

135

and a box in which a few seeds were placed. We then collected during one hour one ant out of

136

three that carried a seed back to the colony. These ants were kept apart and used for the

137

experiment in the following days. We also collected a few ants (weighing between 10-15 mg)

138

to dissect their Dufour gland in order to create an artificial pheromone trail in the middle of

139

the walkway (Heredia and Detrain, 2000). Since ants tended to follow the trail this increased

140

the chance to obtain a straighter path in the middle of the walkway, which allowed us to

141

neglect the effect of path curvature on ant kinematics (Zolliköfer, 1994a). In order to extract

142

the Dufour gland, ants were first anesthetized by placing them in a vial plunged in crushed

143

ice, then killed by removing their head and fixed on their back with insect pins under a

144

binocular microscope. Their gaster was opened transversally with a scalpel following the first

145

sternite and the ventral part was pulled away. The poison gland and the fat gland were then

146

gently removed until the Dufour gland became visible. This latter was then collected and

147

placed in a hexane solution to extract the trail pheromone. We used a concentration of 1 gland

148

/ 20µl which has been shown to be sufficient to elicit a clear trail following response in M.

149

barbarus workers (Heredia and Detrain, 2000).

150

Each time an ant was tested, it was picked from the group of ants that had been separated on

151

the first day of the week, then weighed and isolated in a small box with access to water. The

152

ant was first tested unloaded and then loaded with lead fishing weights whose mass ranged

153

from 2 to 100mg. Every five tested ant we made an artificial trail on the walkway by

154

depositing every centimeter with a 10 µl syringe a droplet of 1 µl of the solution of Dufour

155

gland extract. To reduce stress, ants were transferred from their individual box to the walkway

156

by letting them climb up and down on a pencil. Once on the walkway, the movement of the

157

ant was recorded as soon as it started to walk along a more or less straight path. The ant was

158

then captured at the end of the walkway and anesthetized by placing it in a vial plunged in

159

crushed ice. It was then fixed dorsally with Plasticine under a binocular microscope with its

160

head maintained horizontally. This allowed us to put a drop of superglue (Loctite,

161

http://www.loctite.fr) on the top of its mandibles and to glue a fishing weight. The same

162

procedure as for unloaded ants was then used to film loaded ants. At the end of the

163

experiment the ant was killed and we weighed its head, thorax (with the legs), and gaster

164

separately to the nearest 0.1 mg with a precision balance (NewClassic MS semi-micro,

165

Mettler Toledo, United Sates). These measures were used to compute the displacement of the

166

center of mass (CoM) of the ants on the videos (see SI for details of the procedure).

167

Whether unloaded or loaded, we filmed all ants for at least three strides. We defined a stride

168

period as the time elapsed between two consecutive lift off of the right mid leg. For our

169

analysis, we cropped our videos to a whole number of strides.

170

Data extraction and analysis

171

In order to compute the horizontal movement of the ants’ main body parts (gaster, thorax,

172

head or head and load if one was carried, see SI for details) and of its overall center of mass

173

(CoM) we used the software Kinovea (version 0.8.15, https://www.kinovea.org) to semi-

174

automatically track points of interest on the videos of the top camera (Figure 2). When several

175

video shootings of the same ant had been made, we selected the video in which the ant had the

176

straighter path. As a criteria for path straightness we calculated the ratio of the distance

177

actually traveled by the ant (based on the horizontal trajectory of its center of mass) on the

178

straight line distance between the first and last point of the trajectory and considered that the

179

path was sufficiently straight when this ratio was lower than 1.2.

180

Using the software Kinovea and ImageJ (version 2.0.0, FIJI distribution, https://fiji.sc/) we

181

then accessed the information corresponding to the stepping pattern of the ant. For each video

182

frame we visually determined the state of each leg during locomotion (i.e. in stance phase,

183

swung or dragged) on the lateral view of the ant and recorded the spatial position of the leg

184

tarsus during the stance phases on the dorsal view. These positions were expressed in a

185

coordinate system centered on the neck of the ant, with the X axis corresponding to the

186

longitudinal axis of its body and the Y axis to the transverse axis (Figure 2). In order to

187

compare ants of different sizes, all distances were normalized to the body length of the ant

188

(calculated from the tip of the gaster to the tip of the mandibles).

189

We computed the duty factor for each leg as the fraction of the stride the leg was in contact

190

with the ground (Ting et al., 1994; Spence et al., 2010). For each leg, we also computed the

191

mean relative position at lift off (Posterior Extreme Position: PEP) and at touch down

192

(Anterior Extreme Position: AEP) by averaging the relative positions of the leg over the

193

strides we filmed. Since the path followed by the ant was straight, we also averaged the values

194

of the right and left leg of each pair of legs when computing the duty factors and relative leg

195

positions. Following Wosnitza et al. (2012) and Wahl et al. (2015) we calculated step

196

amplitude rather than stride length. For each leg we computed step amplitude by averaging

197

the distances between PEP and AEP positions in the ant coordinate system. Again, because

198

the path followed by the ant was straight, we averaged the values of the right and left leg of

199

each pair of legs when computing step amplitude.

200

We studied inter-leg coordination by comparing the time of lift off of every leg to the time of

201

lift off of the right mid leg (Wosnitza et al., 2013; Wahl et al., 2015). More precisely, we

202

computed, for each leg, the time lag between the leg lift off and the last lift off of the right

7

203

mid leg. We then divided the value of the time lag by the time elapsed between two

204

successive lift off of the right mid leg. This value was expressed as a phase shift between – π

205

and π for each leg. Finally, we used circular statistics (Batschelet, 1981) to compute the mean

206

vector of the distribution of the phase shifts for specific groups of ants. As an indication of

207

how ant gait was close to an ideal alternating tripod locomotion we also computed the Tripod

208

Coordination Strength (TCS) (Wosnitza et al., 2012; Wahl et al., 2015; Ramdya et al., 2017).

209

This index can take values between 0 and 1. A TCS of 1 corresponds to a perfect alternating

210

tripod gait while a TCS of 0 means that the ant performed a completely different type of gait.

211

Finally, following Moll et al. (2013), we also computed for each ant the change over time of

212

the static stability margin (SSM) during locomotion. For every video frame, the SSM was

213

defined as the minimum distance between the horizontal projection of the ant CoM and the

214

edges of the polygon formed by all legs in contact with the ground, including the dragged

215

legs. The SSM is positive if the projection of the CoM lies inside the polygon, negative

216

otherwise. We considered that the locomotion was statically stable when the ant managed to

217

maintain static stability during locomotion (i.e., when the SSM was positive) and that it was

218

statically unstable when it was not the case (i.e., when the SSM was negative).

219

We performed all data analysis and designed all graphics with R (version 3.5.1) run under

220

RStudio (version 1.0.136). For unloaded condition, we expressed all kinematic variables as a

221

linear function of the decimal logarithm of ant mass. For loaded condition, because the same

222

ants were tested loaded and unloaded, we calculated the difference in the value of each

223

kinematic variable between loaded and unloaded conditions and expressed it as a linear

224

function of both the decimal logarithm of ant mass and the decimal logarithm of load ratio

225

which was defined as 1 + (load mass/ant body mass) (Bartholomew et al., 1988).

226

Results

227

Unloaded ants: influence of body mass (Table 1)

228

Stride frequency (F1,43 = 64.82, P<0.001) and step amplitude for every leg (front leg: F1,43 =

229

4.1, P=0.049; mid leg: F1,43 = 13.0, P<0.001; hind leg: F1,43 = 30.0, P<0.001) decreased with

230

ant mass. As a result, the speed decreased with ant mass as well (F1,43 = 109.2, P<0.001;

231

Figure 3). Thus, relative to their size, big ants move more slowly than small ants. However,

232

absolute speed did not depend on ant mass (mean ± SD: 29.1 ± 4.5 mm.s-1)

233

The duty factor of all legs increased with increasing ant mass, particularly for the front (F1,43 =

234

36.7, P<0.001) and mid (F1,43 = 22.6, P<0.001) legs (Figure S1A-C). Therefore, compared to

235

small ants big ants tend to have more legs in contact with the ground during a stride (F1,43 =

236

36.4, P<0.001). The front and mid legs were almost never dragged by the ants. However,

237

independent of ant mass, hind legs were dragged during 23 % of a stride on average.

238

In an ideal alternating tripod gait, all legs of a tripod lift off simultaneously. In actual

239

locomotion however, there is no such perfect synchronization. Nevertheless, the alternating

240

tripod gait model still holds if the time interval between the lift off of the three legs of the

241

same tripod is small. Figure 4A shows that the ants’ gait is very close to an ideal tripod gait

242

(see also Fig. S2A). However, for bigger ants, the front legs tended to lift off slightly after the

243

mid and hind legs of the same tripod. As a result, the TCS slightly decreased for bigger ants

244

(F1,43 = 6.3, P= 0.016).

245

The front legs tended to be positioned at a larger distance from the longitudinal body axis (Y

246

position) in big ants compared to small ants both at touch down (AEP) (F1,43 = 17.5, P<0.001)

247

and lift off (PEP) (F1,43 = 15.5, P<0.001). All legs, especially the hind legs, tended to be

248

positioned in a more forward position (X position) at lift off (PEP) in big ants compared to

249

small ants (front legs: F1,43 = 20.4, P<0.001; mid legs: F1,43 = 16.6, P<0.001; hind legs: F1,43

250

= 50.5, P<0.001) (Figure 5A).

251

The static stability margin decreased during a stride and reached a local minimum value just

252

before touch down of one of the front legs (Figure 6A & 6B). The minimum value of the

253

static stability margin decreased with increasing ant mass (F1,43 = 4.7, P= 0.036). Moreover,

254

the proportion of time an ant moved in statically unstable locomotion increased with ant mass

255

(F1,43= 5.0, P= 0.030, compare Figures 6A & 6B). Therefore, small ants have a more balanced

256

locomotion than big ants.

257

Loaded ants: influence of ant body mass and load ratio (Table 2)

258

Figure 7 shows the values of load ratio tested for ants of different body masses. Depending on

259

the value of the load ratio, ants exhibited two kinds of behaviors when loaded. They could

260

either keep the load lifted above the ground during locomotion or they could maintain their

261

head in a very slanted position and push the load in front of them (see SI Movies 1-3 for

262

illustrations). We called the first behavior “carrying” and the second “pushing”. The criteria

263

we used to distinguish between the two behaviors is based on whether or not the load glued on

264

the ant mandibles was in contact with the ground during locomotion. Pushing generally

265

occurred for load ratio higher than five for ants above 10mg, while for ants of lower body

266

mass both carrying and pushing could be observed for load ratio higher than four (Figure 7).

267

We will only consider ants that carry their load in the following analyses.

268

Independent of ant mass, stride frequency decreased with increasing load ratio (F2,42 = 19.7,

269

P<0.001). Step amplitude was independent of load ratio for front and mid legs but decreased

270

for hind legs (F2,42 = 3.2, P=0.051). Consequently, ant speed decreased with increasing load

271

ratio (F2,42 = 23.6, P<0.001). However, for ants transporting equivalent loads there was no

272

effect of body mass on both stride frequency and step amplitude.

273

Independent of ant mass, the duty factor increased for the front (F2,42 = 62.2, P<0.001), mid

274

(F2,42 = 27.1, P<0.001) and hind legs (F2,42 = 14.9, P<0.001) for increasing load ratio and,

275

independent of load ratio, the duty factor increased with ant mass, confirming the results

276

obtained on unloaded ants (Figure S1D-F). The mean number of legs simultaneously in

277

contact with the ground increased for increasing load ratio independent of ant size and, to a

278

lesser extent, increased for increasing body mass independent of load ratio (F2,42 = 57.7,

279

P<0.001). Similar to what occurred when ants were unloaded, the front and mid legs were

280

almost never dragged during locomotion when ants were loaded.

281

When the ants were walking loaded their mid and hind legs tended to be more distant from

282

their longitudinal body axis (Y position) with increasing load ratio, both during lift off (mid

283

legs: F2,42 = 10.0, P<0.001; hind legs: F2,42 = 5.3, P= 0.009) and touch down (mid legs: F2,42 =

284

6.1, P=0.005; hind legs: F2,42 = 5.5, P= 0.007) (Figure 5B).

285

While performing loaded locomotion, ants did not exhibit the same inter-leg coordination

286

pattern than during unloaded locomotion (Figure 4). First, there was more dispersion in phase

287

shift between legs for loaded ants, especially for the hind legs and for high values of load ratio

288

(> 3.5, see Figure 4B2). Second, the three legs of the same tripod tended to lift off in a

289

specific order (i.e. mid leg -> front leg -> hind leg). This was especially clear for the hind leg,

290

which was the last to lift off in each tripod. This order seems to be more strictly followed for

291

higher load ratio and for bigger ants (Figure 5B2). As a result, the value of TCS decreased for

292

increasing load ratio (F2,42 = 8.7, P<0.001).

293

Independent of ant size, the proportion of time ants were performing statically unstable

294

locomotion increased with increasing load ratio in loaded ants (F2,42 = 65.4, P<0.001).

295

Discussion

296

In this study, we investigated the kinematics of locomotion of unloaded and loaded ants of the

297

polymorphic species M. barbarus. We found that, relative to their size, small ants were able to

298

carry larger loads than big ants. Small ants also walked faster and were more stable than big

299

ants; all ants, whatever their size, reduced their speed when carrying loads of increasing mass.

300

The locomotion of unloaded ants was very close to an ideal alternating tripod gait. This

301

allowed them to perform a rather statically stable locomotion. On the other hand loaded ants

302

were most of the times statically unstable and their gait changed to more tetrapod-like

303

locomotion, wave gait locomotion and hexapodal stance phases (Figure S2B).

304

Unloaded ants

305

In M. barbarus big ants have, relative to their size, bigger heads than small ants (Heredia and

306

Detrain, 2000; Bernadou et al., 2016). This means that their center of mass is located in a

307

more anterior position compared to small ants. Big ants are thus more likely to be off balance

308

than small ants. Therefore, one should expect static stability to decrease with increasing ant

309

mass, which is what we actually observed. Nevertheless, the question arises of whether the

310

decrease in stability we observed is the same as the decrease one should observed

311

mechanically because of the forward shift of the center of mass of the body, or whether this

312

decrease is less than the one expected because big ants adjust their gait in order to maintain

313

their stability. In order to answer this question we modeled an ideal tripod gait for ants of

314

different sizes. Our model took into account the difference in morphology across ants (for

315

both mass repartition between body parts and relative leg lengths) but assumed ants had the

316

same stepping pattern (based on the mean value of the leg positions observed in our

317

experiment for all ants and then corrected for leg length, see SI for details). Following the

318

method described in the method section, we then computed the minimum static stability

319

margin (SSM) and the proportion of statically unstable locomotion for these ants. The slope of

320

the regression line describing the relationship between the minimum static stability margin

321

and log10(ant mass) and the proportion of statically unstable locomotion and log10(ant mass)

322

was -0.142 and 0.183, respectively. These values should be compared to the values we found

323

in our experiment, i.e., (mean ± CI0.95) -0.041 ± 0.036 and 0.029 ± 0.026, respectively (see

324

Table 1). Thus, if ants were walking with an ideal tripod gait, the influence of ant mass would

325

be more important than what we observed in our data. This means that big ants adjust their

326

locomotion in order to increase their static stability. That this is indeed the case is suggested

327

by the differences observed between small and big ants in both leg positioning and in gait

328

parameters (Table 1). In big ants the front legs lifted off in a more anterior position, so that

329

the minimum SSM (which occurs just before the front leg touch down, Figure 6) was less

330

critical. This led to both an increase in duty factor and a decrease in step amplitude for front

331

and mid legs. In conclusion, the differences in morphology between ants of different sizes do

332

induce a less statically stable locomotion in big ants but this effect is reduced by the fact that

333

they are able adjust their stepping pattern to compensate for this instability.

334

Carrying capacity

335

Small ants were able to carry relatively heavier loads than big ants. This is concordant with

336

the results obtained by Bernadou et al. (2016) in the same species and with those obtained by

337

Burd (2000) in the leaf cutting ants Atta colombica and A. cephalotes. This difference in load

338

carrying capacity can be accounted for by two non-exclusive explanations. The first is related

339

to the well-known scale effect, while the second is related to differences in the locomotion

340

and/or the morphology (induced by allometric relationships) of ants of different sizes.

341

The scale effect is due to the fact that the section of the muscles of an animal (which is

342

directly related to the mechanical power they can develop) increases as the square of its body

343

length while body mass increases as the cube (Schmidt-Nielsen, 1984; Dial et al., 2008). This

344

would lead to a reduction in relative load capacity in big ants compared to small ants.

345

However, this reasoning would hold only if big ants were a simple enlargement of small ones,

346

i.e. if their body parts grew isometrically. As mentioned before, this is not exactly the case in

347

M. barbarus: compared to small ants, big ants not only have larger heads (Bernadou et al.,

348

2016, Fig. S5) but they have also relatively shorter legs (Fig. S6). Nonetheless, the scale

349

effect could still apply to some extent. To assess its importance we compared our data of load

350

carrying capacity in ants of different sizes to those that would be expected if the predictions of

351

the scale effect were computed on ants of different sizes but with same morphology. We

352

considered as the basis for the computation of our predictions the carrying capacity we

353

observed for an ant weighing 1.5mg. As can be seen in Figure 8, the predictions of the

354

carrying capacity for ants of different sizes is close to the curve based on our experimental

355

data representing the 50% probability of carrying a load vs pushing it. It is also close to the

356

curve representing the 50% probability of carrying a load vs dragging it from the field

357

experiments by Bernadou et al. (2016) in which the ants transported food items of various

358

sizes deposited on their foraging trails. Therefore, it seems that ants start pushing in our

359

experiment for about the same load ratio values as they start dragging in Bernadou et al.

360

(2016). Pushing instead of dragging probably occurs as a result of the load being glued on the

361

mandibles.

362

Nonetheless, one cannot exclude that the differences observed in locomotor behavior between

363

small and big ants could also partly explain the differences in carrying capacity. Table 2

364

indeed points out some differences in the kinematics of ants of different sizes, independent of

365

load ratio. However, these differences do not follow any particular logic and are difficult to

366

interpret. Most of the observed differences in carrying capacities in ants of different sizes can

367

thus be explained by a scale effect.

368

Influence of load ratio on locomotion

369

The main effect of carrying a load for an ant is to shift its CoM forward. As a consequence the

370

CoM is located closer to the front edge of the polygon of support, or even lies out of it, and

371

the SSM decreases or becomes negative, leading the ant to perform less statically stable or

372

statically unstable locomotion. Moll et al. (2013) showed that loaded Atta vollenweideri ants

373

can reduce this effect by changing the way they carry their load: by carrying the pieces of

374

grass blade they hold in their mandibles in a more upward, backward-tilted position they can

375

shift their CoM in a somewhat backward position. This is of course impossible in our

376

experiment because ants cannot adjust the position of the load glued on their mandibles. This

377

would not happen either in the field because most of the seeds collected by M. barbarus are

378

not elongated enough to be carried in the same way as pieces of grass blades in grass-cutting

379

ants. The CoM of loaded M. barbarus workers is thus shifted forward and the proportion of

380

time their locomotion is statically unstable during a stride increases for increasing load ratio

381

(Table 2), reaching up to 90% for the highest load ratios.

382

Such statically unstable locomotion has already been reported for insects in the literature. For

383

instance, the cockroach Blaberus discoidalis, when moving at very high speed, often performs

384

statically unstable locomotion and thus maintains its balance through dynamic stability (Ting

385

et al., 1994; Koditschek et al., 2004). Dynamic stability refers to individuals keeping their

386

balance when statically unstable by only briefly “falling” forward before new supporting legs

387

contact the ground (Moll et al., 2013). Statically unstable locomotion has also been observed

388

by Moll et al. (2013) in loaded workers of the grass cutting ant A. vollenweideri. These

389

authors have suggested that loaded ants could use dynamic stability in order to avoid falling

390

over during the statically unstable part of their locomotion (Moll et al., 2010, 2013).

391

However, loaded M. barbarus workers move too slowly (Table 2) to maintain their balance

392

through dynamic stability: they would fall forward before the front leg catches up. Rather, we

393

assume that they maintain their balance by clinging to the ground with the tarsal claws located

394

at the end of their mid and hind legs. Consequently, they tend to keep more legs in contact

13

395

with the ground for increasing load ratio. This leads to a decrease of their stride frequency and

396

TCS and to an increase of the duty factor of all legs (Table 2). Hind legs are of particular

397

importance in keeping the ant balanced because they have a higher lever-arm effect. In our

398

experiment the percentage of time the hind legs were dragged decreases as soon as the ant

399

was loaded independent of ant mass and load ratio (mean ± CI0.95: -12,1 ± 8,2 %), probably

400

because, due to the position of the claws on the pretarsus (Fig; S3), the hind legs can better

401

cling to the ground when they are not moving. In this respect, it would be interesting to

402

investigate how ants maintain their balance when their adhesive prestarsal structures are

403

blocked or when they walk on a slipping substrate (see Ramdya et al., 2017 for an example in

404

Drosophila melanogaster). The tendency for the hind legs to lift off after the front legs

405

touched down also increased for increasing load ratio (Figure 4B1 & 4B2). This is coherent

406

with the balance strategy used by ants, as the SSM is maximal at front leg touch down (Figure

407

6C & 6D) and thus it is less risky to lift off the hind leg at this time. Finally, as a result of the

408

stride frequency diminution (and because step amplitude remains constant), the speed

409

decreases with increasing load ratio, which is concordant with most studies in other load

410

carrying ants, e.g. Atta colombica (Lighton et al., 1987), A. vollenweideri (Röschard and

411

Roces, 2002) and Veromessor pergandei (Rissing, 1982).

412

Reinhardt and Blickhan (2014a) showed that, during steady state locomotion, Formica

413

polyctena uses mainly its hind legs in order to generate propulsion forces while Wöhrl et al.,

414

(2017) showed in Cataglyphis fortis that it is the mid legs that are mainly used for propulsion.

415

In both cases however, the front legs have a brake effect on locomotion. To our knowledge,

416

there are no study so far that measured the ground reaction forces (GRF) in loaded ants.

417

Nonetheless, it is possible to infer the propulsion behavior of the legs in our experiment based

418

on the position of their tarsi. Indeed, as shown by Endlein and Federle (2015), depending on

419

the GRFs, the tarsi attach differently to the substrate. The morphology of the tarsal attachment

420

of M. barbarus (Figure S3) is comparable to that of other ants (Federle et al., 2001; Endlein

421

and Federle, 2008). It seems thus fair to assume that they cling to the substrate in a similar

422

way. As Endlein and Federle (2015), we observed in our videos two positions for the hind leg

423

tarsi during the stance phase: on “heels”, during the first part of the stance phase, and on

424

“toes”, during its second part (Figure S4). This would suggest that hind legs have a

425

“compression and pushing” action in the first part of the stance phase, i.e. participate to

426

propulsion, and then have a “tension and pulling” action on the last part of the stance phase,

427

acting as a holding point for the ants not to fall over. For mid legs, the tarsi were usually in

428

the “heel” position and were thus likely to participate in propulsion. These observations are

429

purely qualitative as the resolution of our videos makes a quantitative analysis of these data

430

tricky. The use of a miniature force plate (Bartsch et al., 2007; Reinhardt & Blickan, 2014b)

431

to compare the GRFs of unloaded and loaded ants would provide crucial insights on how the

432

different legs of the ants contribute to the stability and propulsion of loaded locomotion.

433

Conclusion

434

We have shown in this study that unloaded M. barbarus workers display different gaits

435

depending on their body mass. For big ants, these differences seem to be mainly explained by

436

a compensation for the imbalance caused by their disproportionally bigger head. Small ants

437

are able to carry proportionally heavier loads than big ants and scale effect provides a simple

438

and satisfactory explanation for this difference. Moreover, our results show that loaded ants

439

are often statically unstable during locomotion and that they maintain their balance by

440

clinging to the ground. Further studies are required to determine the contribution of each leg

441

to both stability and propulsion.

442

Big ants are more costly to produce than small ants. So why do colonies produce them if they

443

are less efficient in transporting loads? One answer to this question is that, although big ants

444

have lower load carriage performances than small ants, they are nonetheless able to carry on

445

average loads of higher masses than small ants and to seize and transport items of larger

446

diameters with their large and powerful mandibles (Fig. 3 in Bernadou et al., 2016). This

447

could allow colonies to increase the size range of the food items retrieved to the nest so that

448

they can enlarge their diet breadth and better match the size distribution of the food resources

449

available in their environment (Davidson, 1978). Big ants may also play other roles than

450

foraging in seed-harvesting ant colonies, such as removing the obstacles encountered on

451

foraging trails, cutting thick plant stalks or milling the seeds inside the nest to prepare them

452

for consumption. The significance of our results for the foraging ecology and division of labor

453

in M. barbarus remains therefore to be investigated.

of the front, mid, and hind legs during lift off (PEP) and touch down (AEP) along with their
standard deviation is shown for different ranges of ant body masses (N0-5mg = 13, N5-15mg = 16,
N>15mg = 16). B: Loaded ants; changes in leg positions at lift off (PEP) and touch down (AEP)
when ants were walking loaded compared to when they were walking unloaded. The origin
corresponds to the leg position for unloaded ants. The average change in position over three
strides along with their standard deviation is shown. Ants were categorized in two groups
depending on load ratio (NLR<3.5 = 26, NLR>3.5 = 19). The scale is in units of body length.
