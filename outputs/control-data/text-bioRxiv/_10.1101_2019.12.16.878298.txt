Rhizomorphic lycopsids are the land plant group that includes the first giant trees to grow on Earth
and extant species in the genus Isoetes. Two mutually exclusive hypotheses account for the
evolution of terminal rooting axes called rootlets among the rhizomorphic lycopsids. One hypothesis
states that rootlets are true roots, like roots in other lycopsids. The other states that rootlets are
modified leaves. Here we test predictions of each hypothesis by investigating gene expression in the
leaves and rootlets of Isoetes echinospora. We assembled the de-novo transcriptome of axenically
cultured I. echinospora. Gene expression signatures of I. echinospora rootlets and leaves were
different. Furthermore, gene expression signatures of I. echinospora rootlets were similar to gene
expression signatures of true roots of Selaginella moellendorffii and Arabidopsis thaliana. RSL genes
which positively regulate cell differentiation in roots were either exclusively or preferentially
expressed in the I. echinospora rootlets, S. moellendorffii roots and A. thaliana roots compared to
the leaves of each respective species. Taken together, gene expression data from the de-novo
transcriptome of I. echinospora are consistent with the hypothesis that Isoetes rootlets are true
roots and not modified leaves.

The first giant (> 50 m) trees to grow on Earth, the arborescent clubmosses, were tethered to the
ground by rooting structures termed stigmarian systems whose homology has been debated for
more than 150 years1–9. Stigmarian rooting systems consisted of two components, a central axis
(rhizomorph) on which developed large numbers of fine axes (rootlets). There are two competing
hypotheses to explain the origin of stigmarian rootlets which we designate, the lycopsid root
hypothesis and the modified shoot hypothesis. The lycopsid root hypothesis posits that rootlets are
homologous to roots of other lycopsids. The modified shoot hypothesis posits that rootlets are
modified leaves (microphylls) and homologous to the leaves of other lycosids.

Stigmarian rootlets were interpreted as true roots by the majority of authors until the mid
20 century5,6,10–14. However, a suite of fossil findings in the second half of the 20th century, including

fossil embryos, rhizomorph apices and the abscission of rootlets3,4,15–19 led to the revival of the
modified shoot hypothesis first suggested in 1872, which interpreted rootlets as modified leaves7..
Given that all rhizomorphic lycopsids (sensu20–23) form a monophyletic group, and that extinct
stigmarian rootlets were interpreted as modified leaves this suggested that the rootlets of all
rhizomorphic lycopsids were modified leaves, including the rootlets of extant Isoetes3. The
interpretation that the rootlets of extant Isoetes species were modified leaves was strikingly at odds
with all previous descriptions of Isoetes rootlets that had always been interpreted as roots similar to
the roots of other extant lycopsids11,24–32.

New evidence that is inconsistent with the modified shoot hypothesis has been reported
since the seminal paper by Rothwell and Erwin3. First, the modified shoot hypothesis posits that the
ancestral embryo condition in the rhizomorphic lycopsids lacked an embryonic root, but instead
developed a single shoot axis that divided to give a typical shoot and modified rooting shoot axis
that developed modified leaves (rootlets). However, embryo development in the early diverging
rhizomorphic lycopsid, Oxroadia developed an embryonic root20. Therefore, the embryo of Oxroadia
does not support the hypothesis that a branching event in the embryo produced a rooting shoot axis
(rhizomorph) that developed root-like leaves (rootlets). Second, while the leaves of all plants species
develop exogenously33, in a process that includes the outer-most layers of the shoot, roots of extant
Isoetes originate endogenously34. Therefore, the endogenous development of rootlets is inconsistent
with their interpretation as modified leaves34. Third, the discovery of the development of root hairs
on rootlets of extinct rhizomorphic lycopsids that are identical to the root hairs that develop on
extant lycopsids suggest that rootlets are root-like2. Together these three studies present an
emerging body of evidence that is incompatible with the modified shoot hypothesis.

To independently test the modified shoot hypothesis for the origin of lycopsid roots, we
evaluated gene expression data of the extant rhizomorphic lycopsid, Isoetes echinospora. We
generated, to our knowledge, the first organ specific transcriptome of an Isoetes species
incorporating RNA from the three main organs of the sporophyte: rootlets, leaves and corms. If I.
echinospora rootlets are modified leaves as predicted by the modified-shoot hypothesis we would
expect gene expression profiles to be similar in rootlets and leaves. If, on the other hand, I.
echinospora rootlets are true roots as predicted by the lycopsid root hypothesis we would expect
that gene expression profiles would be different between leaves and rootlets, and gene expression
profiles would be similar between I. echinospora rootlets and roots of Selaginella species.

To define gene expression signatures in the organs of I. echinospora, a population of plants was
collected from the wild (Fig. 1A) and protocols to grow the plants in axenic culture were developed.
The collected plants were grown in the green house and male spores (microspores) and female
spores (megaspores) were produced and then isolated. Megaspores and microspores were surface
sterilised and germinated together in sterile liquid media to generate a population of sporophytes in
axenic culture (Fig. 1B). Sporophytes were transferred to solid media three months after
germination (Fig. 1C). A population of c. 50 I. echinospora plants were grown for approximately four
months to a stage where plants were large enough to extract RNA from the three major organs;
leaves, corm and rootlets (Fig. 2A).

Assembly of an Isoetes echinospora sporophyte transcriptome
A sporophyte transcriptome was generated for rootlets corms and leaves. RNA was isolated from
each organ and sequenced. It was difficult to extract sufficient RNA from these plants because of the
challenge in isolating viable spores, getting the spores to germinate, effecting fertilisation and
getting sporophytes to develop in axenic culture. However, we extracted 1 technical replicate of
rootlets and 2 technical replicates of corm and leaves. The raw reads for all samples were pooled,
quality checked and assembled into contiguous transcripts. The assembled transcriptome comprised
113,464 transcripts with a mean sequence length of 940 base pairs (bp). There were 35,564
sequences over 1 kilobases (Kb) in the assembly, with an N50 of 1313 bp. Proteins were successfully
predicted for c. 95% of the transcripts. To investigate the completeness our transcriptome we next
performed a BUSCO35 analysis to investigate the number of conserved BUSCO35 groups in our
transcriptome. BUSCO35 groups are near-universal single-copy orthologs. Identifing the percentage
of BUSCO35 groups present in our de-novo transcriptome therefore provides a metric for the
completeness of our transcriptome. Of the 430 total BUSCO35 groups searched for in the
Viridiplantae dataset35, 318 (74.0%) were found complete, 87 (20.2%) were found fragmented and
only 25 (5.8%) were missing. These metrics indicate that the transcriptome assembly was high
quality. We next mapped the reads extracted from each of the three different organs; leaves, corms,
and rootlets to calculate the abundance levels for each transcript in each of the three organs
(Supplementary Table S1).

If I. echinospora rootlets were modified leaves, as predicted by the modified shoot hypothesis, we
might expect gene expression signatures to be similar in the rootlets and leaves. To test this
hypothesis, we compared gene expression in rootlets, leaves and corms using a principal coordinate
analysis (PCoA). The two leaf replicates, two corm replicates and the single rootlet sample were
plotted on the first two PCoA axes (which together account for 98.6% of the variance in the sample
(Fig. 2B)). The three tissue types are clearly distinct and separated in gene expression space. The first
PCoA axis accounts for 75.4% of the variance in gene expression and it distinguishes leaves and
corms from rootlets (Fig. 2B). The second PCoA axis accounts for 23.2% of the variance in gene
expression and distinguishes all three tissues from each other (Fig. 2B). The PCoA indicated that gene
expression profiles of rootlets and leaves are distinct and does not support the hypothesis that I.
echinospora rootlets are modified leaves.

If the rootlets of I. echinospora are true roots we expected similarities in gene expression between
rootlets and true roots of other land plant species such as the lycophytes Selaginella moellendorffii
and the seed plant Arabidopsis thaliana. To compare gene expression between these species we first
defined orthologous relationships between the genes of the three species using the OrthoFinder
software36,37. This analysis identified 1,737 single copy orthologs in common between these species.
Using these 1,737 orthologs we compared gene expression between the different species. We
compared average gene expression between I. echinospora rootlets and leaves (this study) with the
published gene expression in roots and leaves of S. moellendorffii 38 and roots and “aerial parts” of
Arabidopsis thaliana (based on EMBL-EBI accession E-GEOD-53197). To compare gene expression

between these different species and organs we subjected the gene expression dataset to a PCoA.
The first three principal coordinates accounted for 95.7% of the variance in the dataset. Axis 1
accounted for 43.6% of the variance and separated the samples by species (Fig. 3A, B). Axis 2,
accounted for 35.9% of the variance and distinguished the two lycophyte transcriptomes (I.
echinospora and S. moellendorffii) from that of the seed plant A. thaliana (Fig. 3A, C). PCoA axes one
and two therefore indicate that the majority of the differences in gene expression is accounted for
by differences between species rather than between roots and leaves. PCoA axis 3 accounted for
16.2% of the variance and distinguished between leaves and roots in all species (Fig. 3B, C). Leaf
samples clustered in the positive values and root samples clustered in the negative values of PCoA
axis 3 (Fig. 3B, C). The clustering of the I. echinospora rootlet sample with both the roots of S.
moellendorffii and A. thaliana on axis 3 (Fig. 3B, C) indicates that the gene expression signature of
the rootlets of I. echinospora is similar to the the gene expression signature of both S. moellendorffii
and A. thaliana. These gene expression data are consistent with the hypothesis that rootlets of I.
echinospora are roots.

To verify our findings that gene expression of I. echinospora rootlets were similar to those of the
true roots of S. moellendorffii and A. thaliana we next determined the expression of the root-specific
ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE SIX-LIKE (RSL) genes in I. echinospora. ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE SIX-LIKE (RSL)
genes positively regulate the development of root hairs in euphyllophytes including A. thaliana39–42
and are expressed in S. moellendorffii roots43,44. RSL genes are markers for vascular plant roots
because they are expressed at a much higher level in roots of A. thaliana (EMBL-EBI accession EGEOD-53197) and S. moellendorffii45 than in leaves and shoots (Supplementary Table S1). We
searched the I. echinospora transcriptome for RSL genes using the BLAST algorithm with RSL-specific
queries. RSL sequences were identified in the I. echinospora transcriptome. A gene tree was
generated and defined four I. echinospora RSL genes in two monophyletic groups (Fig. 4). There
were three transcripts in the RSL Class I clade (106204; 101034; 092963) and a single transcript in
the RSL Class II clade (095243). Average expression of the four RSL genes in rootlets was 4.24
transcripts per million (TPM) (Fig. 4). The average root expression was 5.78 TPM for the six RSL genes
of A. thaliana (EMBL-EBI accession E-GEOD-53197), demonstrating similarities in expression of RSL
genes between in I. echinospora and A. thaliana. In I. echinospora, expression of each RSL Class I
transcript was higher in rootlets than in leaves (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the single I. echinospora Class II
RSL gene transcript (095243) was expressed in rootlets and no expression was detected in the corm
or leaves. These data indicate that RSL genes are preferentially expressed in the I. echinospora
rootlets and not in leaf tissue, as in they are in S. moellendorffii of A. thaliana (Supplementary Table
S1). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that I. echinospora rootlets are roots.

To verify that RSL genes are markers of vascular plant roots we investigated the RSL genes in
Azolla filiculoides, a fern that develops roots with root hairs30,46, and Salvinia cucullata a fern that has
secondarily lost roots with root hairs and instead modified leaves perform rooting functions30,47,48.
We searched the S. cucullata and A. filiculoides genomes and proteomes49 for RSL genes using the
BLAST algorithm with RSL-specific queries. A gene tree was constructed with the retrieved
sequences and allowed us to identify 3 RSL Class I genes and a single RSL Class II gene in the A.
filiculoides genome (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. S1). Consistant with their role in root development in
A. filiculoides the RSL genes were expressed in the roots46. However, there were no RSL genes in the
S. cucullata genome. S. cucullate sequences were identified in closely related basic-helix-loop-helix
transcription factor subfamily XI50,51 but none were identified in RSL clade (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig.

S1). We conclude that the loss of RSL genes accompanied the evolutionary loss of roots with root
hairs in Salvinia cucullate, which is consistent with RSL genes being markers of vascular plant roots.
Furthermore, if the rootlets of I. echinospora were modified leaves, similar to the root-like modified
leaves of S. cucullate, we might have expected that RSL genes would have also been lost from the I.
echinospora genome. Instead, RSL genes are preferentially expressed in I. echinospora rootlets just
as they are in S. moellendorffii roots. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the I.
echinospora rootlet is a root and not a modified leaf.

Taken together these data – the distinct gene expression profiles of the rootlets and leaves
of I. echinospora, the similarity in expression profiles of orthologous gene preferentially expressed in
rootlets of I. echinospora and roots of S. moellendorffii and A. thaliana, and the expression of the RSL
genes in the rootlets of I. echinospora and roots of S. moellendorffii and A. thaliana – support the
lycopsid root hypothesis which posits that Isoetes rootlets are roots and not modified leaves.

The homology of the rootlets of both extinct and extant rhizomorphic lycopsids have been
contentious for the past 150 years, with two competing hypotheses. The first, interprets the rootlets
as true roots similar to the roots of other lycopsids. The second, interprets rootlets as modified
leaves. Despite the second hypothesis that posits that rootlets are modified leaves being widely
accepted over the past 30 years1,3,52 there is a growing body of evidence2,34 that suggests that
rootlets should be interpreted as true roots. Here we report the de novo transcriptome of I.
echinospora that we used to test predictions of the two competing hypotheses. We discovered that
expression profiles in I. echinospora rootlets and leaves were different. We showed that gene
expression profiles of I. echinospora rootlets and S. moellendorffii and A. thaliana roots were similar.
Finally, RSL genes involved in root cell differentiation are preferentially expressed in I. echinospora
rootlets as they are in S. moellendorffii roots and the roots of euphyllophytes (A. thaliana, Oryza
sativa and Brachypodium distachyon39–42). Taking these three pieces of evidence together, we
conclude that Isoetes rootlets are true roots, like those of extinct and extant lycopsids and not
modified leaves.

The new evidence presented here adds to the growing and extensive list of similarities between
the rootlets of rhizomorphic lycopsids – Isoetes species and extinct taxa such as Stigmaria – and the
roots of other lycopsids2,20,34. This growing body of evidence supports the hypothesis that rootlets
are roots and not modified leaves. The rootlets of the rhizomorphic lycopsids and roots of all extant
lycopsids are indeterminate radially symmetric axes that branch by isotomous dichotomy, develop
endogenously within specialised structures, develop a root meristem with root cap and produce root
hairs31,32,34,53. If the modified shoot hypothesis were correct it would have required the direct
modification of a determinate leaf that did not branch, developed exogenously and was
characterised by a ligule, stomata and dorsiventral symmetry into a rootlet. Each of these leaf
characters would have had to be lost and all of the rootlet characters, which are shared among the
lycopsids, would have had to evolve independently. By contrast, if the lycopsid root hypothesis is
correct and rootlets are roots then there is no requirement for this large suite of character state
changes. Instead, the only character transitions required to account for rootlet character states were
the collateral positioning of the phloem, the regular rhizotaxy and rootlet abscission4. Although
these three characters (collateral positioning of the phloem, the regular rhizotaxy and rootlet
abscission) are predominately leaf characters, they are not exclusive to leaves; each has been
described in the roots of other species of land plants. The collateral position of the phloem is found

in Lycopodium roots including, Lycopodium lucidulum, Lycopodium clavalum, Lycopodium obscurum
and Lycopodium complanalum54, regular rhizotaxy develops in Ceratoptertis thalictroides, Cucurbita
maxima and Pontederia cordata55–57 and roots abscise in Oxalis esculenta, Abies balsamea, Pinus
strobus, Tsuga canadensis and Azolla species58–63. Based on character transitions alone we suggest
that the hypothesis that rootlets of the rhizomorphic lycopsids are roots, similar to other lycopsid
roots, is a more parsimonious hypothesis than interpreting rootlets as modified leaves.

Our new evidence from the transcriptome of I. echinospora adds to the numerous traits that are
common between the rootlets of rhizomorphic lycopsids and the roots of other lycopsids. It is not
possible to rule out the hypothesis that all of these similarities in antomy, develop and now gene
expression may be the product of convergent evolution. However, we suggest that it is more
parsimonious to interpret the rootlets of the rhizomophic lycopsids as true roots than modified
leaves.

The gene expression data from the de novo I. echinospora transcriptome are consistent with the
hypothesis that the rootlets of the rhizomorphic lycopsids are roots and not modified leaves. We
therefore interpret the rootlets of the rhizomophic lycopsids as roots developing from a unique root
bearing organ; the rhizomorph21,53,64. This conclusion suggests that the dichotomously branching
rooting axis is conserved among all lycopsids and a distinguishing character of the group. The
dichotomous branching of these rooting axes has been conserved for over 400 million years and our
comparative transcriptomic analysis suggest that the RSL genes function during root development in
Selaginella and Isoetes has been conserved since these species shared a common ancestor at least
375 million years ago65. Our comparative analysis of the transcriptomes of extant lycophytes support
the hypothesis that the rooting systems of extant Isoetes species and their extinct giant ancestors
are homologous. The data also suggest that the development of the large rooting systems of the
lycopsid trees that were an important component of the Palaeozoic flora and played a key role in
changing the Earth’s Carbon Cycle were controlled by the same genes that regulate root
development in their extant herbaceous descendants.

Materials and Methods
Plant collection and growth
Mature I. echinospora plants were collected from Loch Aisir and Loch Dubhaird Mor in September
2013 and 2014 from North West Sutherland (Scotland, UK) with the permission of the John Muir
Trust and the Scourie Estate. I. echinospora plants were identified on the basis of their echinate
megaspore ornamentation66. Mature I. echinospora plants were grown submerged in aquaria in
Levington M2 compost topped with coarse gravel in a glasshouse at Oxford University at 18°C under
a 16 h light : 8 h dark photoperiod.

contamination from other organisms. A procedure was developed to surface sterilise I. echinospora
spores and germinate a population of axenically grown plants, based on previously developed
procedures67–69. Sporophylls were removed from the mature plant population growing in aquaria in
September (2013 and 2014) when sporangia were mature67. Using forceps (under a Leica M165 FC

were washed in 1% (v/v) sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC) for 5 min. Sporangia were broken
and loose spores were washed in 0.1% NaDCC for a further 5 min. Following the NaDCC washes,
loose spores were rinsed for 5 min three times in ddH2O. Microspores were centrifuged for 5 min at
5000 rpm between washes). Once sterilised, mega and micro-spores were mixed together in ddH2O
in a Petri dish. Petri dishes were sealed with parafilm, and incubated in darkness at 4⁰C for 2 wk.
After 2 wk, Petri dishes were moved to a 16 h light : 8 h dark photoperiod at 18⁰C. Approximately
30% of surface sterilised megasporangia contained megaspores that germinated, and within these
megasporangia c. 25% of the total megaspore population germinated. It was possible to identify
germinating megaspores because cracking of the megaspore wall was visible and the presence of
archegonia on the megagametophyte. Once fertilisation occurred, developing sporophytes were
identified by the presence of the first leaf. Sporophytes were left to continue to grow in ddH2O
water until the two leaf two rootlet stage when they were moved to magenta boxes containing; ½
Gamborg’s medium70, supplemented with 1% phytogel (Sigma). Plants were embedded in Gamborg
media and submerged in liquid Bold's Basal Medium (Sigma, UK).

RNA extraction and sequencing
Total RNA was extracted from root, corm and leaf tissues from c. 50 I. echinospora plants. Total RNA
from leaves (two independent replicates), corm (two independent replicates) and rootlets (one
replicate) was extracted with the RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen). On-column DNase I treatment was
performed with RNase-free DNase I (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA
was synthesised with ProtoScript II reverse transcriptase (New England Biolabs) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions, using oligo(dT) primer. Total cDNA samples were quantified with a
Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer. RNA purity and quality were checked with an Agilent 2100
Bioanalyzer. cDNA was sequenced by the High-Throughput Genomics Group at the Wellcome Trust
Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford. Sequencing resulted in 195,072,304 paired end
reads separated into five samples: 2 leaves samples (35,718,157; 35,555,048 paired end reads), 2
corm samples (38,728,989; 44,379,751 paired end reads) and one rootlet sample (40,690,359 paired
end reads). The raw read libraries have been deposited under SRP135936 on the NCBI Sequence
Read Archive.

De novo transcriptome assembly, protein predictions and expression analysis
Raw reads were quality trimmed using Trimmomatic-0.3271, to remove remaining Illumina adaptors
and low quality tails. Ribosomal RNA was filtered out using Sortmerna-1.972 and error corrected
using BayesHammer (SPAdes-16 3.5.0)73 (with setting --only-error-correction) and Allpaths-LG-483274
(with setting PAIRED_SEP=-20 and ploidy = 2). Reads were normalised using Khmer-0.7.1 with a
khmer size of 21. Before assembly, paired end reads were stitched together using Allpaths-LG483274. A de novo transcriptome assembly was made with the cleaned, stitched reads using SGA75,
SSPACE-v376, and CAP377. Finally assembled scaffolds were corrected using Pilon-1.678. The
Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly project has been deposited at DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under the
accession GGKY00000000. The version described in this paper is the first version, GGKY01000000.
Proteins were predicted from the de novo transcriptome assembly using GeneMarkS-T79, Prodigal80

Comparison of gene expression between I. echinospora organs
Using the sporophyte transcriptome assembly we next mapped the reads from the three organ
libraries – leaves, corms, and rootlets – to the transcriptome to measure the expression levels of
each transcript in the three tissues using Salmon82. To investigate the similarities between gene
expression in the different organs we carried out a PCoA on the three organ types. Euclidean
distances were derived from the expression of all transcripts (TPM) in each organ and were
subjected to PCoA in PAST83 using a transformation exponent of 2.

Orthologous relationships between I. echinospora, S. moellendorffii and A. thaliana proteins were
determined using OrthoFinder36,37. OrthoFinder was run with I. echinospora proteins and protein
datasets for 57 species from Phytozome (full list of species in Supplementary Table S2) including the
Rhodophyta Porphyra umbilicalis, seven species of chlorophytes, the bryophytes Marchantia
polymorpha and Physcomitrella patens, the lycophytes Selaginella moellendorffii and 46 angiosperm
species. This analysis resulted in the identification of 38,217 orthogroups, accounting for 82.6% of all
genes included in the analysis (The results of the OrthoFinder analysis were we deposited on
Zenodo, http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3574570).

To compare gene expression between I. echinospora, S. moellendorffii and A. thaliana we
identified single copy orthologs between these species based on the OrthoFinder36,37 analysis. In
total, 1,737 single copy orthologs were found between the three species. Using these 1,737
orthologs we contrasted gene expression between the different species. We investigated average
genes expression between I. echinospora rootlets and leaves (this study) with the published average
gene expression between roots and leaves of S. moellendorffii38 and A. thaliana. A. thaliana gene
expression was based on average gene expression in “aerial part” and “root” of 17 different natural
accessions (EMBL-EBI accession E-GEOD-53197). To investigate similarities in gene expression
between these 1,737 orthologs we carried out a PCoA in PAST83. Euclidean distances were derived
from the Log10 transformed gene expression of the 1,737 orthologs (Supplementary Table S1).
Euclidean distances were subjected to a PCoA in PAST83, using a transformation exponent of 4.

Phylogenetic Analyses
Phylogenetic analyses were carried out on the RSL genes. Blast queries were assembled based on
previously published gene trees of RSL genes50. Sequences were used to blast the protein databases
of the; Marchantia polymorpha "primary" (proteins) (version 3.1, November, 2015), Physcomitrella
patens "primary" (proteins) (version 3.0, January 12, 2014), Selaginella moellendorffii "primary"
(proteins) (version 1.0, January 12, 2014), Amborella trichopoda (proteins) (version 1.0, 2013) and
Arabidopsis thaliana "primary" (proteins) (TAIR10) on the http://marchantia.info/blast/ server. Two
fern protein databases were also searched; Azolla filiculoides protein v1.1 and Salvinia cucullata

this study. All proteins were aligned in MAFFT84,85, manually edited in Bioedit86. Maximum likelihood
gene trees were generated in PhyML 3.087, using Jones, Taylor and Thorton (JTT) amino acid
substitution model. To verify the absence of RSL genes in the S. cucullate the genomes and
proteomes of A. filiculoides and S. cucullate were searched by Blast using the A. thaliana protein
sequence RSL1 (AT5G37800) using an E-value cut off of 1E-15. A gene tree was generated as
described above including the addition of A. thaliana protein sequence from subfamilies VIIIb and
XI50,51 (Fasta alignments files for both gene trees we deposited on Zenodo,
http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3574570).

Selaginella moellendorffii. Comparison of gene expression profiles by PCoA in the transcriptomes of
A. thaliana, circles, S. moellendorffii, squares and I. echinospora, triangles. Leaf samples coloured
green, root samples orange. A, comparison of principal coordinate axis 1 and 2. B, comparison of
principal coordinates axis 1 and 3. C, comparison of principal coordinate axis 2 and 3. Values in
brackets on each axis describe the percentage of total variance accounted for by each axis. Axis 1
separates gene expression in the three species. Axis 2 distinguishes gene expression between the
two lycophytes transcriptomes, I. echinospora and S. moellendorffii from A. thaliana. Axis 3
distinguishes between the leaf samples and the root samples in each transcriptome.
