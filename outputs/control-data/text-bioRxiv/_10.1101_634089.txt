Abstract

14

Bacteria are protected by a polymer of peptidoglycan that serves as an exoskeleton. In

15

Staphylococcus aureus, the enzymes that assemble peptidoglycan move during the cell cycle from

16

the periphery, where they are active during growth, to the division site where they build the

17

partition between daughter cells. But how peptidoglycan synthesis is regulated throughout the cell

18

cycle is not understood. Here we identify a membrane protein complex that spatially regulates S.

19

aureus peptidoglycan synthesis. This complex consists of an amidase that removes peptide chains

20

from uncrosslinked peptidoglycan and a partner protein that controls its activity. Typical amidases

21

act after cell division to hydrolyze peptidoglycan between daughter cells so they can separate.

22

However, we show that this amidase controls cell growth. In its absence, excess peptidoglycan

23

synthesis occurs at the cell periphery, causing cells to grow so large that cell division is defective.

24

We show that cell growth and division defects due to loss of this amidase can be mitigated by

25

attenuating the polymerase activity of the major S. aureus peptidoglycan synthase. Our findings

26

lead to a model wherein the amidase complex regulates the density of peptidoglycan assembly

27

sites to control peptidoglycan synthase activity at a given cellular location. Removal of peptide

28

chains from peptidoglycan at the cell periphery promotes synthase movement to midcell during

29

cell division. This mechanism ensures that cell expansion is properly coordinated with cell

30

division.

31

Main text

32

The bacterial cell wall, which is largely composed of a polymer called peptidoglycan, is

33

essential for survival. The chemical steps in cell wall biosynthesis are conserved, but how the

34

activities of peptidoglycan biosynthetic enzymes are coordinated with growth and division is

35

unclear1,2. To make peptidoglycan, glycan chains are first polymerized from a disaccharide-peptide

36

precursor, Lipid II, and then crosslinked to the existing matrix via their attached peptides (Fig. 1a).

37

Crosslinking is carried out by the transpeptidase domain of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs)

38

using a mechanism that involves formation of a covalent adduct between the enzymes and the stem

39

peptides on newly synthesized peptidoglycan3. There are two modes of peptidoglycan synthesis

40

during the cell cycle. One mode occurs at the cell periphery and leads to an expansion in cell size;

41

the other occurs during cell division when a cross wall, or septum, is formed between two daughter

42

cells4-6. The first protein that assembles at the division site is the highly conserved tubulin homolog

43

FtsZ, which forms a ring-shaped structure called the Z-ring that serves as a scaffold for the ordered

44

recruitment of the rest of the divisome7. In Staphylococcus aureus, proper placement of FtsZ

45

depends on controlling cell size8-10, which in turn requires spatial control over peptidoglycan

46

synthesis.

47

Here, we used a transposon screen to identify possible regulators of peptidoglycan

48

synthesis in S. aureus. We discovered a gene encoding a putative amidase, LytH, and showed that

49

deletion of this gene caused dramatic phenotypes resulting from dysregulated coordination of cell

50

growth with cell division. Reconstitution of LytH amidase activity required a membrane protein

51

partner, ActH, that forms a stable complex with the amidase. Using uncrosslinked and crosslinked

52

substrates made in vitro, we found that the purified protein complex only removes uncrosslinked

53

stem peptides; cellular experiments were consistent with this preference. We used fluorescence

54

microscopy to show that excess peptidoglycan synthesis occurs at the cell periphery when LytH is

55

absent. Genetics combined with biochemistry showed that decreasing activity of the major

56

peptidoglycan synthase, PBP2, corrects the cell size and division defects due to lytH deletion. We

57

also showed that PBP2 accumulates at the cell periphery in the absence of LytH, which is likely

58

responsible for the excess peptidoglycan synthesis there. Taken together, our findings lead to a

59

model in which the LytH-ActH complex acts to remove free stem peptides from peptidoglycan in

60

order to control the density of peptidoglycan assembly sites, and thereby to control cell expansion.

Results

62

A transposon screen identified lytH as important in cell size control and divisome placement

63

To identify new regulators of peptidoglycan synthesis in S. aureus, we performed a

64

transposon screen11 using sublethal oxacillin to partially inhibit transpeptidase activity. We

65

hypothesized that genes whose absence was synthetically lethal with partial loss of transpeptidase

66

activity might regulate peptidoglycan synthesis. Reads due to transposon insertions were depleted

67

in a number of genes, but we focused on lytH, which encodes a putative amidase, because

68

inactivation of a cell wall hydrolase typically protects, rather than sensitizes, cells towards a b-

69

lactam12 (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1). A spot titer assay confirmed that lytH deletion

70

sensitized cells to oxacillin (Supplementary Fig. 1). Amidases are hydrolytic enzymes that cleave

71

stem peptides from peptidoglycan to separate daughter cells following cell division13. The ΔlytH

72

mutant exhibited division defects, but they were not the cell separation defects previously observed

73

for amidases. Instead, deletion of lytH led to misplacement of nascent septa (Fig. 1c) and larger

74

cell size (Fig. 1d). The nature of the defects implied that LytH affects cell division at an earlier

75

stage than amidases that effect cell separation.

76

Muropeptide analysis confirmed that LytH has amidase activity

77

To assess LytH amidase activity, we compared the chemical composition of sacculi from

78

wild-type (WT) and ΔlytH cells. Purified sacculi were digested with mutanolysin to generate

79

muropeptides for LC-MS analysis (Supplementary Fig. 2). We then searched for muropeptides

80

consistent with amidase processing and identified a species having an exact mass that suggested

81

structure X14 (Supplementary Fig. 3a). This species was more abundant in sacculi from cells

82

expressing a catalytically-active copy of lytH 15 than from ΔlytH cells (Fig. 1e). Using LC-MS/MS,

83

we confirmed the identity of this species, which is a tetrasaccharide with only a single stem peptide

84

attached (Supplementary Fig. 3b,c). We were able to detect this tetrasaccharide-monopeptide

85

species because mutanolysin cannot cleave MurNAc-GlcNAc linkages unless the MurNAc residue

86

carries a stem peptide16. The tetrasaccharide-monopeptide likely represents only a fraction of LytH

87

products, as longer glycan chains extensively lacking stem peptides would not be detected with

88

this method.

89

LytH requires a partner protein for amidase activity

90

Having in vivo evidence of LytH amidase activity, we attempted to reconstitute its activity

91

in vitro, but these efforts were unsuccessful (Supplementary Fig. 4). We speculated that LytH

92

requires a partner protein for activation. To identify potential activators, we performed co-

93

immunoprecipitation and isolated a polytopic membrane protein containing seven predicted

94

transmembrane helices and a C-terminal domain with three tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) (Fig.

95

2a and Supplementary Fig. 5). This membrane protein was previously designated Rbd because it

96

is a putative rhomboid protease10 (Supplementary Table 2). A mutant lacking this gene was

97

sensitive to oxacillin (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 6) and displayed cell division defects similar

98

to the ∆lytH mutant (Fig. 2b), supporting a role for the uncharacterized protein in activating LytH.

99

We co-expressed LytH and its putative protein partner and purified a stable complex (Fig.

100

2c and Supplementary Fig. 7a). We first tested amidase activity of the purified complex on

101

peptidoglycan polymers prepared from native S. aureus Lipid II17 using a mutant polymerase18

102

that can form short glycan strands but cannot crosslink them (Supplementary Fig. 4c). To visualize

103

the polymers, we labeled the stem peptides with biotin-D-Lys (BDL) for immunoblotting19. No

104

changes in the polymers were observed with LytH treatment alone, but in the presence of the

105

complex, we saw a reduction in the intensity of BDL-labeled glycan strands (Fig. 3a and

106

Supplementary Fig. 7b). When a radiolabel was incorporated into the glycan backbone20, we

107

observed a reduction in polymer size but not in the intensity of bands (Fig. 3b and Supplementary

108

Fig. 8). These changes, which were only observed for complexes containing catalytically-active

109

LytH, were consistent with removal of stem peptides from the polymers. We were able to detect

110

the tetrasaccharide-monopeptide by LC-MS analysis (Supplementary Fig. 9). We were also able

111

to detect the stem peptide released from synthetic peptidoglycan polymers21 (Fig. 3c and

112

Supplementary Fig. 10). Taken together, these experiments confirmed that the LytH complex can

113

remove stem peptides from peptidoglycan. We have renamed the membrane protein partner ActH

114

(activator of LytH).

115

LytH prefers to cleave uncrosslinked peptidoglycan

116

Many amidases efficiently degrade sacculi because they can act on crosslinked

117

peptidoglycan. We tested the LytH-ActH complex with purified sacculi but did not detect

118

hydrolytic activity, suggesting the complex prefers uncrosslinked substrates (Supplementary Fig.

119

11a). To directly assess substrate preferences, we needed matched substrates that only differed in

120

whether they were crosslinked. We made uncrosslinked glycan strands from native S. aureus Lipid

121

II, introduced a radiolabel on the glycan backbone, and subjected a portion of the labeled material

122

to crosslinking22 (Supplementary Fig. 11b). Treatment with the LytH complex showed that the

123

uncrosslinked material reacted to produce lower molecular weight material, but the crosslinked

124

material did not detectably react in the presence of the complex (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig.

125

11c). We concluded that LytH is unlike previously characterized amidases involved in cell

126

separation because it strongly prefers uncrosslinked peptidoglycan as a substrate. Consistent with

127

the preference observed in vitro using synthetic peptidoglycan, we observed a substantial increase

128

in abundance of the tetrasaccharide-monopeptide species in digests of sacculi from lytHWT cells

129

that were treated with sublethal oxacillin to reduce crosslinking (Fig. 1e). Hence, the in vitro and

130

in vivo evidence indicates that LytH removes stem peptides from membrane-proximal

131

peptidoglycan that is not, or at least not extensively, crosslinked.

132

Slowing peptidoglycan synthesis rescues lytH deletion defects

133

We next investigated how LytH could regulate cell division. The division defects resulting

134

from lytH deletion implied LytH is important for FtsZ assembly. We found using a functional

135

FtsZ-sGFP fusion5 that FtsZ is frequently mislocalized in ∆lytH cells (Fig. 4a and Supplementary

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/634089; this version posted May 10, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

136

Fig. 12). Therefore, LytH is needed for the correct positioning of FtsZ, and the divisome, at

137

midcell. Because FtsZ assembly defects have been observed in other mutants that grow to

138

aberrantly large size8-10, we speculated that the defects in divisome placement were due to

139

uncontrolled cell growth. We exploited the observation that the ∆lytH mutant is temperature-

140

sensitive to select for suppressors that might provide more information about the role of LytH (Fig.

141

4b). We identified multiple suppressors with distinct mutations in the polymerase domain of PBP2,

142

a bifunctional enzyme that is the major peptidoglycan synthase in S. aureus23 (Supplementary

143

Table 3). We found that pbp2WT overexpression was toxic in a DlytH background (Supplementary

144

Fig. 13a). We purified one of the PBP2 suppressors, PBP2F158L, and found that it produced fewer

145

and shorter glycan strands than PBP2WT (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 13b,c). The pbp2

146

suppressor also restored ∆lytH cells to WT size (Fig. 1d) and corrected FtsZ mislocalization defects

147

(Fig. 4a). These results showed that reducing PBP2 polymerase activity compensates for loss of

148

LytH (Supplementary Fig. 13d). If so, one would predict that moenomycin treatment, which

149

selectively inhibits PBP2-mediated peptidoglycan polymerization18, would also rescue growth of

150

the ∆lytH mutant at elevated temperature; indeed, this was the case (Fig. 4c). Taken together, these

151

findings suggested that LytH controls cell growth by regulating the activity of PBP2.

152

Loss of LytH leads to excessive peripheral peptidoglycan synthesis

153

We used fluorescence microscopy to test whether peptidoglycan synthesis was

154

dysregulated in the absence of LytH. To monitor sites of peptidoglycan synthesis, we first labeled

155

cells with fluorescent D-lysine (FDL)24, which is exchanged into stem peptides by transpeptidase

156

activity. Fluorescent bands at midcell reflect septal peptidoglycan synthesis. Compared with WT

157

cells, the ∆lytH mutant showed fewer cells with signal at midcell and more cells with signal at

158

misplaced septa or peripheral puncta (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 14). By measuring the ratio

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/634089; this version posted May 10, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

159

of fluorescence intensity at the septum vs. periphery in cells that have a single complete septum,

160

we found that FDL-labeled stem peptides were enriched at the periphery in the absence of LytH

161

(Fig. 5a). To determine whether the transpeptidase activity that was observed is due to reaction at

162

sites of new peptidoglycan synthesis, we used a pulse-chase approach25 to selectively detect

163

nascent peptidoglycan with fluorescent vancomycin, which binds stem peptides having terminal

164

D-ala-D-ala residues. We found that newly synthesized peptidoglycan was enriched at the

165

periphery in ΔlytH cells (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 15). Together, these experiments showed

166

that the excess peripheral transpeptidase activity, as assessed by FDL incorporation, occurs where

167

new peptidoglycan is being made in ∆lytH cells.

168

Our selection of pbp2 suppressors that reduced peptidoglycan synthesis activity and

169

corrected cell size suggested PBP2 might be responsible for the excessive peripheral peptidoglycan

170

synthesis. Therefore, we also examined PBP2 localization using a GFP-PBP2 fusion26. We found

171

that PBP2 was frequently mislocalized in ∆lytH cells (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 16).

172

Mislocalization did not appear to be a consequence solely of FtsZ mislocalization because we

173

observed some punctate PBP2 foci at peripheral regions where FtsZ was not found (Fig. 5d and

174

Supplementary Fig. 17). Moreover, quantitative assessment showed reduced colocalization of FtsZ

175

and PBP2. Taken together, our findings show that LytH spatially regulates peptidoglycan synthesis

176

by reducing PBP2 activity at the cell periphery in order to control cell size and allow for proper

177

assembly of the divisome.

178

Discussion

179

The two key findings in this paper are the discovery of the first direct regulator for an

180

amidase in a Gram-positive organism and the demonstration that this amidase controls cell growth.

181

Amidases are a class of cell wall hydrolases previously shown to be important for separating

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/634089; this version posted May 10, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

182

daughter cells after cell division by cleaving crosslinked peptidoglycan13. We have shown that the

183

amidase studied here, LytH, instead cleaves stem peptides from uncrosslinked peptidoglycan. We

184

have also shown that LytH controls peptidoglycan synthase activity, determining how much

185

peripheral synthesis occurs. This controls cell size and proper cell division.

186

A key question is how this amidase, which acts on membrane-proximal peptidoglycan, can

187

spatially regulate peptidoglycan synthesis activity. We propose the following model (Fig. 6).

188

Previous studies have shown that the major peptidoglycan synthase in S. aureus, PBP2, is recruited

189

to midcell after FtsZ localization5 and recruitment of MurJ27,28, the flippase that exports Lipid II,

190

the substrate for peptidoglycan synthesis, to the cell surface5. It has been shown that PBP2 is

191

recruited to midcell by substrates present there with which it covalently reacts26. Our findings show

192

that altering the density of PBP2 binding sites at the periphery is also necessary, as a way to control

193

the rate of cell expansion so that the division machinery can properly localize to midcell at the

194

appropriate time. We have found that PBP2 can react with stem peptides in preassembled glycan

195

strands even in the absence of ongoing polymerization by the polymerase domain (Supplementary

196

Table 4). This means that excess free stem peptides in nascent or partially crosslinked

197

peptidoglycan could transiently trap PBP2 so that it cannot move freely to another site in the cell.

198

Because Lipid II can diffuse freely, peripheral peptidoglycan synthesis will continue unless

199

binding sites on peptidoglycan polymer that capture the synthase at the periphery are sufficiently

200

reduced. Trimming of excess stem peptides reduces PBP2 activity to keep cell expansion in check.

201

This would explain the decreased ratio of septal to peripheral synthesis even in ∆lytH cells that

202

have a proper septum. According to this model, the more uncrosslinked stem peptides there are,

203

the more important LytH is for regulating peptidoglycan synthesis to control cell size. There are

204

substantial cell size and division defects even in cells grown at 30°C, but the morphological

205

aberrations become more pronounced with increased temperature until LytH becomes essential for

206

viability. LytH therefore plays a key role in controlling the spatial distribution of peptidoglycan

207

synthases to ensure that cell expansion is coordinated with cell division.

208

We note that ActH and LytH are found in separate operons with genes important in control

209

of protein and sugar metabolism (Supplementary Table 5), suggesting a role in adjusting

210

peptidoglycan synthesis depending on nutrient availability. We also note that actH (rbd) forms a

211

synthetic lethal pair with noc10, which encodes the nucleoid occlusion protein that coordinates

212

DNA replication with division and prevents FtsZ assembly over the chromosomes. Noc has been

213

described as a spatial regulator of cell division7,8. In its absence, cells grow larger than normal,

214

resulting in division defects. The genetic connection between ActH and Noc, and the linkage

215

between metabolism genes and lytH/actH, reinforce the importance for cell division of ensuring

216

that cell wall synthesis is properly integrated with primary metabolic pathways inside the cell29-

217

31

.

218

The need to regulate cell wall hydrolases to control their activity in cells has long been

219

appreciated. The peptidoglycan cell wall is essential for bacterial survival and perturbations that

220

compromise cell wall integrity reduce cell viability. At the same time, cell wall hydrolases that

221

cleave bonds within peptidoglycan are important for cell wall remodeling and cell separation.

222

Hydrolytic activity must be regulated to ensure that hydrolases act when and where they should in

223

coordination with peptidoglycan synthesis to ensure cell wall integrity1. Surprisingly, the first cell

224

wall hydrolase regulators, NlpD and EnvC32, were only discovered recently. NlpD and EnvC are

225

lipoproteins that activate the hydrolytic activity of cell separation amidases in Gram-negative

226

bacteria. In the Gram-positive organisms Streptococcus pneumoniae and Bacillus subtilis, the

227

ABC transporter-like FtsEX complex has been implicated in regulating the hydrolases PcsB33 and

228

CwlO34, but it has not yet been established whether FtsEX directly activates these hydrolases.

229

Here we have shown that ActH directly interacts with LytH and activates its amidase

230

activity. A topology prediction of ActH revealed three parts to the protein: a large intracellular

231

region, a polytopic rhomboid fold, and an extracellular TPR domain (Supplementary Fig. 18a).

232

Rhomboid proteins are present across all kingdoms of life, but their physiological function in

233

bacteria is largely unknown35. Our work establishes a role for rhomboid proteins in bacterial cell

234

wall biogenesis and we suggest that ActH orthologs may play a similar role in amidase activation

235

in some other bacteria, including B. subtilis (Supplementary Fig. 18b). How ActH activates LytH

236

is under investigation, although we note that ActH does not activate LytH by proteolytic processing

237

because the amidase remains intact both in cells and in vitro (Supplementary Table 6). A better

238

understanding of the domain requirements for ActH activation of LytH activity will help focus the

239
240

search for additional regulators of hydrolases.

Bacterial growth conditions. Strains are listed in Supplementary Table 7. All S. aureus strains
were grown in tryptic soy broth (TSB), unless otherwise indicated, containing appropriate
antibiotics at temperatures ranging from 30-42°C with aeration. All E. coli strains were grown in
Lysogeny broth (LB), unless otherwise indicated, containing appropriate antibiotics at
temperatures ranging from 30-37°C with aeration. Plasmids were cloned using E. coli XL1-Blue,
Stellar, and NovaBlue(DE3) for general purposes and E. coli NEB 10-beta for pTarKO constructs.
Plasmids isolated from E. coli DC10B were directly electroporated into S. aureus HG003 strains
without first passaging through S. aureus RN4220. The E. coli C43(DE3) strain was used for
overexpression of LytH-His6, His6-ActH, His6-ActH-LytHWT-1x FLAG, and His6-ActHLytHD195A-1x FLAG. The E. coli BL21(DE3) strain was used for overexpression of LytH-His6
truncations and PBP2-His8 constructs. Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations for S.
aureus strains: kanamycin (50 μg/mL), neomycin (50 μg/mL), tetracycline (3 μg/mL),
chloramphenicol (10 μg/mL), and erythromycin (10 μg/mL). Antibiotics were used at the
following concentrations for E. coli strains: carbenicillin (100 μg/mL) and kanamycin (50 μg/mL).
Plasmid construction. Plasmids and oligonucleotides are listed in Supplementary Tables 8 and 9,
respectively. DNA sequencing of plasmids was conducted through Eton Bioscience and the DanaFarber/Harvard Cancer Center DNA Sequencing Facility. Genomic DNA prepared from S. aureus
strain RN4220 was used as template in PCR reactions to amplify S. aureus genes.
pTD6. The kanR marker (primers oTD3 and oTD4) and the 1-kb sequences upstream (primers
oTD24 and oTD25) and downstream (primers oTD7 and oTD8) of the lytH open reading frame
were amplified by PCR. Overlap PCR was performed to stitch together the three fragments, and
the resulting fragment was cloned between the BamHI and SalI restriction sites of pKFC36.
pTP63 expression plasmids. To construct pTP6310 plasmids containing anhydrotetracycline (atc)inducible constructs, the gene sequence with its native ribosome-binding site (-25) was amplified
by PCR. When needed, a C-terminal 1x FLAG tag encoded in a primer was appended to the gene
sequence. For plasmid pTD10, primers oTD38 and oTD39 were used. For plasmid pTD11, primers
oTD40 and oTD41 were used. For plasmid pTD18, primers oTD54 and oTD58 were used. For
plasmid pTD19, primers oTD56 and oTD57 were used. The gene fragments were cloned between

pLOW expression plasmids. To construct pLOW37 plasmids containing IPTG-inducible constructs,
the gene sequence with the native rpoB ribosome-binding site (-25) was amplified by PCR. When
needed, a C-terminal 1x FLAG tag encoded in a primer was appended to the gene sequence. For
plasmid pTD30, primers oTD86 and oTD85 were used. For plasmid pTD31, primers oTD87 and
oTD85 were used. For plasmid pTD34, a gBlock gene fragment was synthesized by IDT. For
plasmid pTD39, primers oTD86, oTD111, oTD104, and oTD106 were used; in this case, overlap
PCR was performed to stitch together the two fragments. The gene fragments were cloned between
the SalI and BamHI restriction sites of the pLOW vector.
pTD2 and pTD3. To construct plasmid pTD2 for His6-LytHWT [E41-A291] overexpression and
purification, the gene sequence for lytH was amplified by PCR using primers oTD15 and oTD17.
To construct plasmid pTD3 for His6-LytHWT [T102-A291] overexpression and purification, the
gene sequence for lytH was amplified by PCR using primers oTD16 and oTD17. The gene
fragments were cloned between the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites of the pET15b vector.
LytHWT [E41-A291] encodes a LytH truncation missing the predicted transmembrane domain.
LytHWT [T102-A291] encodes a LytH truncation missing the predicted transmembrane and SH3
domains.
pTD42. This construct is used for LytHWT [M1-A291]-His6 overexpression and purification. The
gene sequence for lytH was amplified by PCR using primers oTD117 and oTD116. The gene
fragment was cloned between the NcoI and XhoI restriction sites of the pET28b vector.
pTD47. This plasmid is used to make a tetR-marked deletion of saouhsc_01649. The tetR marker
(primers oTD145 and oTD146) and the 1-kb sequences upstream (primers oTD141 and oTD142)
and downstream (primers oTD143 and oTD144) of the saouhsc_01649 open reading frame were
amplified by PCR. Overlap PCR was performed to stitch together the three fragments, and the
resulting fragment was cloned between the BamHI and SalI restriction sites of the pTarKO
vector38.
pTD48. This construct is for PBP2F158L [K60-S716]-His8 overexpression and purification. The
pET42a(+)-pbp2 plasmid17 template was linearized by PCR using primers oTD148 and oTD149 .
The linearized DNA was phosphorylated at the 5’ ends using T4 polynucleotide kinase, and the
ends were ligated to re-produce the circular DNA. Plasmid pET42a(+)-pbp2E114Q was constructed
using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (StrataGene) with primers YQ1 and YQ2 and
plasmid template pET42a(+)-pbp2.
pTD51. This construct is for the dual expression of His6-saouhsc_01649 [N2-K487]-lytH [M1A291]-1x FLAG. First, the gene sequence for lytH was amplified by PCR using primers oTD166
and oTD167, and the gene fragment was cloned between the NdeI and KpnI restriction sites of the
pETDuet-1 vector. Next, the gene sequence for saouhsc_01649 was amplified by PCR using
primers oTD160 and oTD161, and the gene fragment was cloned between the EcoRI and HindIII
restriction sites of the previously made pETDuet-1-lytH vector.
pTD52. This construct is for His6-saouhsc_01649 [N2-K487] overexpression and purification.
First, plasmid pTD51 was digested with NcoI and HindIII restriction enzymes. The excised NcoI-

His6-saouhsc_01649 [N2-K487]-HindIII fragment was then cloned between the NcoI and HindIII
restriction sites of the pET28b vector.
pTD54. This construct is for the dual expression of His6-saouhsc_01649 [N2-K487]-lytHD195A
[M1-A291]-1x FLAG. pTD51 plasmid template was linearized by PCR using primers oTD103
and oTD104. The linearized DNA was phosphorylated at the 5’ ends using T4 polynucleotide
kinase, and the ends were ligated to re-produce the circular DNA.
pTD71. This is a cadmium chloride (CdCl2)-inducible S. aureus expression vector for an FtsZsGFP sandwich fusion5. Plasmid pCN5139 was digested with ApaI and XhoI restriction enzymes.
The excised ermR resistance cassette was then cloned between the ApaI and XhoI restriction sites
of the pCN-ftsZ55-56sGFP vector.
pTD72. This is an anhydrotetracycline-inducible S. aureus expression vector for a C-terminal FtsZ
[M1-R390]-mCherry fluorescent fusion with a 5-amino acid spacer sequence. This fusion protein
was designed using a published sequence for a functional FtsZ-mCherry fluorescent fusion5. The
gene sequence for ftsZ was amplified by PCR using primers oTD248 and oTD249. The sequence
for mCherry40 was amplified by PCR from a gBlock gene fragment synthesized by IDT using
primers oTD250 and oTD227. Overlap PCR was performed to stitch together the two fragments
using primers oTD248 and oTD227, and the resulting fragment was cloned between the KpnI and
BlpI restriction sites of the pTP63 vector.
Strain construction. To construct the ΔlytH::kanR marked deletion mutant, a previously published
method was used36. Briefly, plasmid pTD6 was electroporated into S. aureus strain RN4220 and
transformants were selected on 10 μg/mL chloramphenicol at 30°C. Transformants were cultured
at 42°C to promote chromosomal integration of the plasmid; integrants were selected on 5 μg/mL
chloramphenicol at 42°C. Confirmed integrants were passaged in TSB without antibiotics at 30°C
for several days to promote plasmid excision from the chromosome. Deletion mutants were
selected on 50 μg/mL kanamycin and 50 μg/mL neomycin at 30°C. The ΔlytH::kanR deletion was
confirmed by colony PCR and sequencing, and the marked deletion was transduced into other
strain backgrounds to construct strains TD024 and TD240.
To construct strains containing pTP63 constructs10, the plasmids were first electroporated
into S. aureus strain TD011 and transformants were selected on 10 μg/mL chloramphenicol at
30°C. The pTP63 constructs were transduced from these transformants into strain TD024 to
construct strains TD036, TD037, TD074, and TD075.
To construct strains containing pLOW constructs37, the plasmids were first electroporated
into S. aureus strain RN4220 and transformants were selected on 10 μg/mL erythromycin at 30°C.
The pLOW constructs were transduced from these transformants into strain TD024 to construct
strains TD134, TD135, TD157, and TD164.
To construct the Δsaouhsc_01649::tetR marked deletion mutant, a previously published
method38 was used. Briefly, plasmid pTD47 was UV-irradiated and electroporated into S. aureus
strain TD140, and double-crossover mutants were selected on 3 μg/mL tetracycline and 10 μg/mL
targocil. The Δsaouhsc_01649::tetR deletion was confirmed by colony PCR, and after expressing
pKFC-tarO, the marked deletion was transduced into strains HG003, TD024, and TD134 to
construct strains TD177, TD178, and TD179, respectively.

To construct strains constitutively expressing a fluorescent GFP-PBP2 fusion, the nonreplicative plasmid pPBP2-3126 was first electroporated into S. aureus strain RN4220 and
transformants were selected on 10 μg/mL erythromycin at 30°C. The plasmid integrates at the
native pbp2 locus of the chromosome, and transformants were screened to identify good
fluorescent colonies. The integrated pPBP2-31 construct was then transduced into strains HG003,
TD024, and TD036 to construct strains TD261, TD262 and TD263, respectively.
To construct strains expressing a CdCl2-inducible fluorescent FtsZ-sGFP sandwich fusion5,
plasmid pTD71 was first electroporated into S. aureus strain RN4220 and transformants were
selected on 10 μg/mL erythromycin. From the transformants, plasmid pTD71 was transduced into
strains HG003, TD024, and TD104 to construct strains TD268, TD269, and TD282, respectively.
To construct dual fluorescent strains that simultaneously express GFP-PBP226 and FtsZmCherry, plasmid pTD72 was first electroporated into S. aureus strain TD011 and transformants
were selected on 10 μg/mL chloramphenicol at 30°C. The pTD72 construct was then transduced
from the transformant into strains TD261 and TD262 to construct strains TD278 and TD279,
respectively.
Phage transduction was performed using a previously published protocol38. Briefly, S. aureus
donor cultures were mixed with staphylococcal phage ϕ85 and 10 mM CaCl2. After 30 min of
incubation at room temperature, top agar (0.7% agar in TSB media) containing 7 mM CaCl2 was
added, and the mixture was poured on tryptic soy agar (TSA) plates. The plates were incubated
overnight at 30°C, and TSB was added to the plates the next day. After overnight incubation, the
phage lysate was harvested from the plate and filtered. The phage lysate was used to transduce S.
aureus recipient cultures by mixing recipient cells, phage lysate, LB media, and CaCl2.
Transductants were selected on TSA plates containing the appropriate antibiotics and 0.05%
sodium citrate. Colonies that appeared on the plates were passaged twice on sodium citrate, and
transductants were confirmed using colony PCR.

Overexpression and purification of PBPX: E. coli BL21(DE3) was transformed with plasmid
pMW1010 encoding E. faecalis His6-PBPX [T36-P429]. This protein was expressed and purified
as reported previously19.
Transposon sequencing. A high-density transposon library of S. aureus HG003 was prepared45,
treated with 37 ug/mL oxacillin, and sequenced as previously reported11. The oxacillin and control
sequencing data can be found in the National Center for Biotechnology Information BioSample
database using accession numbers SAMN08025141 and SAMN08025168, respectively. The data
was processed as reported previously11, and genes significantly enriched and depleted under
oxacillin treatment were identified using a two-sided Mann-Whitney U test corrected for multiple
hypothesis testing via the Benjamini-Hochberg method. All scripts used for this analysis can be
found at https://github.com/SuzanneWalkerLab/TnSeqMOAPrediction.
Transmission electron microscopy. S. aureus strains were inoculated in TSB and the cultures
were grown at 30°C overnight with aeration. The overnight cultures were diluted 1:100 into fresh
TSB and grown to mid-log phase at temperatures ranging from 30-42°C. Cells were collected,
added to an equal volume of fixative (1.25% formaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 0.03% picric
acid in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4), and pelleted for the fixation process. TEM
samples were prepared by the Electron Microscopy Facility at Harvard Medical School
(Department of Cell Biology), and images were captured on the JEOL 1200EX instrument.
Spot dilution assay. S. aureus strains were inoculated in TSB with antibiotics and the cultures
were grown at 30°C overnight with aeration. Overnight cultures were diluted 1:100 into fresh TSB
without antibiotics and grown to mid-log phase. The cultures were normalized, ten-fold dilutions
were prepared in TSB, and 5 μL of each dilution was spotted onto TSA plates containing the
appropriate antibiotics (0.1-0.125 µg/mL oxacillin or 0.01 µg/mL moenomycin A) and inducer.
Plates were incubated overnight at temperatures ranging from 30-42°C. A Nikon D3400 DSLR
camera fitted with an AF Micro-Nikkor 60 mm f/2.8D lens was used to take pictures of the plates.
Muropeptide analysis. S. aureus strains were inoculated in TSB with antibiotics and the cultures
were grown at 30°C overnight with aeration. Overnight cultures were diluted to OD600 = 0.02 in
fresh TSB with the appropriate antibiotics and grown for 6-8 hours at 37°C. For the oxacillin
treatment condition, cells were grown in TSB supplemented with 0.03125 μg/mL oxacillin. Cells
were harvested (10,000 rpm for 5 min) from 2 mL of each culture. The cell pellets were processed
for muropeptide analysis as previously described46, with the following modifications. For
mutanolysin digestion, the pellet was resuspended in a 100 μL digestion buffer of 12.5 mM
NaH2PO4, pH 5.5, and 10 μL of mutanolysin (4000 U/mL stock in H2O), and the mixture was
incubated at 37°C for 16 hr on an orbital shaker (300 rpm). The lyophilized materials were
resuspended in 100 μL of H2O and 15 μL was injected for LC-MS separation of muropeptides.
LC-MS was conducted using an Agilent Technologies 1200 series HPLC in line with an
Agilent 6520 Q-TOF mass spectrometer and electrospray ionization (ESI) operating in positive
ion mode and the low (1700 m/z) mass range. The Agilent Q-TOF was partially funded by the
Taplin Funds for Discovery program.
The muropeptide fragments were separated on a Waters Symmetry Shield RP18 column (5
μM, 3.9 x 150 mm) with a matching column guard using previously published LC-MS

conditions17: 0.5 mL min solvent A (H2O, 0.1% formic acid) for 5 min followed by a linear gradient
of 0 to 40% solvent B (acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) over 25 min.
For targeted LC-MS/MS identification of the tetrasaccharide-monopeptide species (866.3864
[M+2H]2+), 25 μL of muropeptide sample from oxacillin-treated wild-type cells was injected. The
same method and column as above were used, with the following modifications: prec. m/z =
866.3881; Z = 2; retention time = 14.3 min; delta retention time = 2 min; iso. width = ~4 m/z.
LC-MS data were analyzed using the Agilent MassHunter Workstation Qualitative Analysis
software version B.06.00. Theoretical isotope distributions were obtained using the Thermo
Xcalibur software version 3.0.63. Muropeptide species were extracted using their theoretical m/z
values with a mass error of ± 20 ppm. The observed and theoretical isotope distributions were
compared to confirm the species. The relative ion count for a species of interest was calculated by
dividing its extracted ion count (EIC) by the sum of the EICs for the following species within the
same experiment and sample (we refer to this sum as the total ion count, TIC): monomer
(1253.5856 [M+H]+), dimer (1209.0617 [M+2H]2+), trimer (1194.2204 [M+3H]3+), and tetramer
(1186.7998 [M+4H]4+). These are the theoretical mass-to-charge ratios used to extract the ions.
All relative ion count plots represent the means and standard deviations from three independent
experiments. P-values were determined using an unpaired, two-tailed t-test: *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01;
ns, not significant.
Pairwise comparison of muropeptide abundance. LC-MS total ion chromatograms were
converted from Agilent Masshunter .d format to .mzdata format and uploaded to the XCMS
platform (The Scripps Research Institute). Pairwise comparison of muropeptide abundance was
performed with the HPLC/Q-TOF parameter. Pairwise data were sorted using the following
parameters to distinguish relevant species from background signal: retention time (rtmed) between
12-18 min for this LC-MS method; fold enrichment greater than 5; maxint > 10000; and
dataset1_mean > 10000.
LytH topology prediction and homology model. LytH transmembrane topology was predicted
using TMHMM Server version 2.0. LytH homology model was generated using the Phyre2 server
and displayed in MacPyMol version 1.6. A sequence alignment of S. aureus LytH and E. coli
AmiC was generated using Clustal Omega to identify the catalytic residues in LytH belonging to
the amidase_3 family of proteins15.
Overexpression and purification of full-length LytH. E. coli C43(DE3) was transformed with
plasmid pTD42 encoding full-length S. aureus LytH [M1-A291] with a C-terminal His6 tag.
Colonies were inoculated into 50 mL Terrific broth supplemented with 50 μg/mL kanamycin, and
the culture was grown overnight at 37°C with aeration. The overnight culture was diluted 1:100
into 1.5 L Terrific broth supplemented with 50 μg/mL kanamycin and grown at 37°C with aeration
until mid-log phase, at which point the culture was shifted to 16°C. LytH expression was induced
by the addition of 1 mM isopropyl-β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), and the culture was grown
for another 18-20 hr at 16°C with aeration. Cells were harvested (3600 rpm, 20 min, 4°C),
resuspended in 30 mL Buffer A (25 mM HEPES, pH 6.8, 200 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol)
supplemented with 1 mg/mL lysozyme and 250 μg/mL DNase, and lysed using an EmulsiFlex-C3
cell disruptor (Avestin). The cell lysate was centrifuged at low speed (10000xg, 5 min, 4°C) to
collect and remove cell debris, and the supernatant was transferred for ultracentrifugation (35000
rpm, 45 min, 4°C). The membrane pellet was resuspended in 30 mL Buffer A supplemented with

1% n-Dodecyl β-D-maltoside (DDM, Avanti Polar Lipids), homogenized with a Dounce
homogenizer, and the homogenate was tumbled at 4°C for 1 hr. A second ultracentrifugation step
(35000 rpm, 45 min, 4°C) was performed to remove non-homogenized membranes, and the
supernatant was applied to 2 mL of pre-washed Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) at 4°C. The Ni-NTA resin
was pre-equilibrated in Buffer B (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% DDM,
10 mM imidazole). After collecting the flowthrough, the resin was washed with 3 times 10 CV of
Buffer A containing: 1% DDM/10 mM imidazole, 0.25% DDM/50 mM imidazole, and 0.1%
DDM/80 mM imidazole. The protein was eluted with 10 CV of Buffer A supplemented with 0.05%
DDM and 400 mM imidazole. The eluted LytH protein was concentrated using a 50 kD MWCO
Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter Unit (EMD Millipore). The LytH protein was further purified
using size-exclusion chromatography with a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (GE Life
Sciences) equilibrated in Buffer C (25 mM HEPES, pH 6.8, 200 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.05%
DDM). The final protein concentration was measured via Nanodrop using the calculated extinction
coefficient. Purified LytH protein was diluted to 20 μM in Buffer C, aliquoted, and stored at -80°C.
Biotin-D-lysine labeling of glycan strands. A previously published method was adapted to label
and detect glycan strands19. Briefly, 1X reaction buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mM CaCl2,
60 μM Zn(OAc)2), BDL (3 mM), Lipid II (5 μM), and SgtBY181D (5 μM) were combined in a final
volume of 10 μL (5% DMSO). The reactions were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and
then quenched at 100°C for 5 min. LytH, ActH, LytHWT-ActH, LytHD195A-ActH, or LytH
truncation mutants (1 μL of 20 μM stock) was added next. The reactions were incubated at room
temperature for 16 hr and then quenched at 100°C for 5 min. To label glycan strands, E. faecalis
PBPX (1 μL of 40 μM stock) was added and the reactions were incubated at room temperature for
1 hr. Finally, reactions were quenched by addition of an equal volume of 2X SDS loading buffer
and analyzed using a previously published protocol19, with the following modifications. Five μL
of each reaction was loaded into a 4-20% gradient polyacrylamide gel and run at 180V for 40 min.
The products were transferred onto a 0.2 μM PVDF membrane (BioRad) and the membrane was
blocked with SuperBlock TBS blocking buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific) for 1.5 hr at room
temperature. Biotinylated products were probed using IRDye 800CW streptavidin (LI-COR)
diluted 1:5000 in SuperBlock TBS buffer for 1 hr at room temperature. The blot was washed
several times with 1X TBS, imaged using an Odyssey CLx imaging system (LI-COR), and
analyzed with ImageJ.
Co-immunoprecipitation with 1x FLAG-tagged proteins. S. aureus strains TD134, TD135, and
TD157 carrying IPTG-inducible, FLAG-tagged full-length LytH, GFP, and truncated LytH,
respectively, were grown in 25 mL TSB supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics at 30°C
overnight with aeration. Overnight cultures were diluted 1:100 into 1 L TSB supplemented with
10 μg/mL erythromycin and 1 mM IPTG. Cultures were grown at 37°C for 6-8 hr with aeration to
induce the expression of the FLAG-tagged proteins. Five hundred mL of cultures were harvested
(3600 rpm, 15 min, 4°C) and the cell pellet was resuspended in 30 mL of lysis buffer (1X PBS,
pH 7.4, 10 μg/mL DNase, 20 μg/mL RNase, 200 μg/mL lysostaphin, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 complete
EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet (Roche)). The resuspended cells were incubated at 37°C for 1
hr on a shaking platform to promote cell lysis, then cooled on ice, and further lysed using an
EmulsiFlex-C3 cell disruptor. The lysate was spun down (10000xg, 15 min, 4°C) and the
supernatant was transferred for ultracentrifugation (35000 rpm, 45 min, 4°C). The membrane pellet
was resuspended in 3 mL of membrane extraction buffer (1X PBS, pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 1%

Triton X-100), homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer, and the homogenate was tumbled at
4°C for 1 hr. A second centrifugation step (10000xg, 15 min, 4°C) was performed to remove the
remaining cell debris. The supernatant (~3 mL) was added to 3 mL of no salt wash buffer (1X
PBS, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100) to dilute the salt. The diluted sample was batch incubated with 50
μL of pre-washed α-FLAG M2 magnetic beads (Sigma) at 4°C for 1 hr on a rocker. The α-FLAG
M2 magnetic beads were pre-equilibrated in 1X PBS, pH 7.4. After incubation, the samples were
transferred to a magnetic tube rack to separate the magnetic beads containing bound proteins from
the supernatant. The beads were washed with 5x 500 μL of wash buffer (1X PBS, pH 7.4, 200 mM
NaCl, 1% Triton X-100). To elute bound proteins, the magnetic beads were resuspended in 125
μL of elution buffer (1X PBS, pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 150 μg/mL 3x FLAG
peptide) and the samples were incubated for 15 min at room temperature to allow the proteins to
elute. The tubes were then transferred to the magnetic rack and the supernatant containing eluted
proteins were collected. A second elution step with 125 μL of elution buffer was performed. The
eluate and wash fractions were heated at 37°C for 15 min in SDS loading buffer and then separated
on a 4-20% gradient polyacrylamide gel. The gel was stained with InstantBlue Protein Stain
(Expedeon) for 1 hr at room temperature, destained with H2O, and imaged using a FluorChem R
system (ProteinSimple). Protein bands were excised and stored in deionized H2O prior to
submission for mass spectrometry analysis at the Taplin Mass Spectrometry Facility, Harvard
Medical School.
N-terminal Edman sequencing of LytH. C-terminal FLAG-tagged LytH was expressed in strain
TD134 and purified from detergent-solubilized membranes as described above. The eluate was
separated on a 4-20% gradient polyacrylamide gel. Separated proteins were transferred to a 0.2
µm methanol-activated PVDF membrane. After the transfer, the membrane was washed with
deionized H2O (5 washes, 5 min each). The membrane was then soaked in staining solution (0.02%
Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (ThermoFisher Scientific), 40% methanol, 5% acetic acid) for 30
sec at room temperature. The staining solution was removed and the membrane was immediately
soaked in destaining solution (40% methanol, 5% acetic acid) for 1 min at room temperature. The
destaining solution was removed and the membrane was washed with deionized H2O (6 washes, 5
min each). After the washes, the membrane was placed on a Whatman filter paper to air-dry
completely. Protein bands were visible against a clear background. The LytH protein band was
excised and submitted for Edman sequencing analysis at the Tufts University Core Facility.
ActH topology prediction and phylogeny analysis. ActH transmembrane topology was
predicted using TMHMM Server version 2.0. The domain structure of ActH was determined using
the NCBI blastp (protein-protein BLAST) suite. Using NCBI CDART (Conserved Domain
Architecture Retrieval Tool), ActH homologs with a similar domain structure as ActH, containing
a rhomboid domain and tetratricopeptide repeats, were identified. Most homologs were found in
the Firmicutes. Several homologs from each genus were then crosschecked using the TMHMM
Server version 2.0 to confirm that their predicted membrane topologies were similar to that of
ActH. The confirmed 228 CDART hits were loaded through the NCBI Batch Entrez database using
their NCBI taxonomy IDs, and the 16S rRNA sequences from 196 species were extracted in
FASTA format. These 16S rRNA sequences were aligned and phylogenic analysis was performed
using Geneious version 9.1.5 as follows. First, a multiple sequence alignment of the 16S rRNA
sequences was generated based on the ClustalW algorithm. The built-in Geneious Tree Builder

neighbor-joining method.
Overexpression and purification of LytH-ActH complexes and ActH. E. coli C43(DE3) was
transformed with plasmid pTD51 encoding S. aureus LytHWT-1x FLAG and His6-ActH, plasmid
pTD54 encoding S. aureus LytHD195A-1x FLAG and His6-ActH, or plasmid pTD52 encoding S.
aureus His6-ActH. Colonies were inoculated into 50 mL Terrific broth supplemented with 100
μg/mL carbenicillin, and the culture was grown overnight at 37°C with aeration. The overnight
culture was diluted 1:100 into 2 x 1 L Terrific broth supplemented with 100 μg/mL carbenicillin
and grown at 37°C with aeration until mid-log phase, at which point the culture was shifted to
20°C. Dual protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 mM IPTG, and the culture was
grown for another 18-20 hr at 20°C with aeration. Cells were harvested (3600 rpm, 20 min, 4°C)
and resuspended in 30 mL Buffer A (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol)
supplemented with 1 mg/mL lysozyme, 1 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride
(TCEP-HCl, ThermoFisher Scientific), and 250 μg/mL DNase. The resuspended cells were stirred
at 4°C for 30 min to disperse clumps and lysed using an EmulsiFlex-C3 cell disruptor. The cell
lysate was centrifuged at low speed (10000 xg, 5 min, 4°C) to collect and remove cell debris, and
the supernatant was transferred for ultracentrifugation (32000 rpm, 45 min, 4°C). The membrane
pellet was resuspended in 30 mL of Buffer A supplemented with 1% DDM and 1 mM TCEP, and
homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was tumbled at 4°C for 1 hr. A second
ultracentrifugation step (32000 rpm, 45 min, 4°C) was performed to remove non-homogenized
membranes, and the supernatant was applied to 1 mL of pre-washed TALON metal affinity resin
(Takara Clontech) at 4°C. The TALON resin was pre-equilibrated in Buffer A supplemented with
0.05% DDM and 1 mM imidazole. After collecting the flowthrough, the resin was washed with 40
CV of Buffer A containing: 1% DDM/2 mM imidazole, 0.2% DDM/4 mM imidazole, 0.1%
DDM/6 mM imidazole, 0.05% DDM/8 mM imidazole, and 0.05% DDM/10 mM imidazole. The
protein was eluted with 20 CV of Buffer A supplemented with 0.05% DDM and 150 mM
imidazole. The eluted protein complex was concentrated using a 100 kD MWCO Amicon Ultra
Centrifugal Filter Unit (EMD Millipore). The concentrated protein complex was further purified
using size-exclusion chromatography with a Superose-6 Increase 10/300-GL (GE Life Sciences)
column equilibrated in Buffer B (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.05%
DDM). The final protein concentration was measured via Nanodrop using the calculated extinction
coefficient. Purified proteins were diluted to 20 μM in Buffer B, aliquoted, and stored at -80°C.
Overexpression and purification of truncated LytH. E. coli BL21(DE3) was transformed with
plasmid pTD2 encoding S. aureus His6-LytHWT [E41-A291] or plasmid pTD3 encoding S. aureus
His6-LytHWT [T102-A291]. Colonies were inoculated into 25 mL LB supplemented with 100
μg/mL carbenicillin, and the culture was grown overnight at 37°C with aeration. The overnight
culture was diluted 1:100 into 1.5 L LB supplemented with 100 μg/mL carbenicillin and grown at
37°C with aeration until mid-log phase, at which point the culture was shifted to 16°C. Protein
expression was induced by the addition of 1 mM IPTG, and the culture was grown for another 1820 hr at 16°C with aeration. Cells were harvested (3600 rpm, 20 min, 4°C) and resuspended in 30
mL Lysis Buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 0.6% 3-((3-cholamidopropyl)

centrifuged at low speed (10000 xg, 5 min, 4°C) to collect and remove cell debris, and the
supernatant was transferred for ultracentrifugation (32000 rpm, 45 min, 4°C). After
ultracentrifugation, the supernatant was applied to 2 mL of pre-washed Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) at
4°C. The Ni-NTA resin was pre-equilibrated in Buffer A (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM
NaCl, 20% glycerol) supplemented with 2 mM imidazole. After collecting the flowthrough, the
resin was washed with 20 CV of Buffer A containing: 10, 20, and 40 mM imidazole. The protein
was eluted with 5 CV of Buffer A supplemented with 500 mM imidazole. The eluted protein was
concentrated using a 10 kD MWCO Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter Unit (EMD Millipore). The
concentrated protein was further purified using size-exclusion chromatography with a Superdex
75 10/300 GL column (GE Life Sciences) equilibrated in Buffer A. The final protein concentration
was measured via Nanodrop using the calculated extinction coefficient. Purified proteins were
diluted to 50 μM in Buffer A, aliquoted, and stored at -80°C.
Preparation of radiolabeled peptidoglycan polymers. To prepare radiolabeled peptidoglycan
oligomers, a [14C]-label was initially incorporated by incubating synthetic Lipid I with UDP-[14C]GlcNAc (specific activity= 300 nCi/nmol) using MurG as previously published20. [14C]-Lipid II
was incubated at room temperature with SgtBY181D (2 µM) in 1X TGase buffer (50 mM HEPES,
pH 7.5, and 10 mM CaCl2) in 20% DMSO for 20 min.
To prepare WTA-modified oligomers, synthetic peptidoglycan oligomers and native
peptidoglycan oligomers were first prepared cold. To prepare synthetic, cold peptidoglycan
oligomers, a batch of synthetic Lipid II (20 µM) was incubated with SgtBY181D (2 µM) at room
temperature in 1X TGase buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, and 10 mM CaCl2) in 20% DMSO for
20 min. To prepare native peptidoglycan oligomers, a batch of native Lipid II (8 µM) was
incubated with SgtBY181D (800 nM) at room temperature in 1X TGase buffer and 20% DMSO.
Polymerization proceeded for 8 min before heat inactivation of SgtBY181D at 95°C for 10 min. After
cooling to room temperature, the radiolabeled WTA-disaccharide precursor, [14C]-LIIAWTA (4.5
µM, specific activity = 300 nCi/nmol), and LcpB (2 µM) were added to each batch of
peptidoglycan oligomers. Reactions proceeded for 2.5 hr at room temperature. LcpB was
subsequently heat-inactivated at 95°C for 10 min.
PAGE analysis of amidase activity. Radiolabeled peptidoglycan oligomer mixtures as prepared
above were incubated with 2 µM LytH alone, LytHD195A-ActH, or LytHWT-ActH and 600 µM
Zn(OAc)2. Reactions were incubated at room temperature overnight. Subsequently, reactions were
quenched with methanol (equal volume; 10 µL) and dried to completion with a speed vacuum.
Reactions were re-hydrated with 10 µL 2X SDS loading dye. The reactions were loaded on
acrylamide gels, which have been described previously47. Tris/SDS gels (dimensions being 20 cm
x 16 cm, H x W; 1.0 mM thickness) were prepared with 10 % acrylamide. The two running buffers
were composed as follows: the anode buffer was 100 mM Tris (pH 8.8), and the cathode buffer
consisted of 100 mM Tris (pH 8.25), 100 mM Tricine, and 0.1% SDS. The gels ran at constant
voltage (30 mA) for 5 hr and were subsequently dried using a gel dryer (Labconco). Dried gels
were incubated with a general phosphor screen for approximately 12-48 hr. The autoradiographs
were imaged using a Typhoon 9400 imager (GE Healthcare) and analyzed using ImageJ software.
Preparation of crosslinked WTA-oligomers. To prepare native peptidoglycan oligomers, a batch
of native Lipid II (8 µM) was incubated with SgtBY181D (800 nM) at room temperature in 1X TGase
buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, and 10 mM CaCl2) and 20% DMSO. Polymerization proceeded

for 8 min before heat inactivation of SgtBY181D at 95°C for 10 min. After cooling to room
temperature, the radiolabeled WTA-disaccharide precursor, [14C]-LIIAWTA (4.5 µM, specific
activity = 300 nCi/nmol), and LcpB (2 µM) were added to each batch of peptidoglycan oligomers.
Reactions proceeded for 2.5 hr at room temperature. LcpB was subsequently heat-inactivated at
95°C for 10 min. Following precipitation and removal of both SgtBY181D and LcpB, PBP4 (2 µM)
was added to each reaction and incubated at room temperature for 2 hr followed by inactivation at
95°C for 10 min. In addition to an untreated control, reactions were then subjected to either
LytHWT-ActH (2 µM) or lysostaphin (1 mg/ml) treatment overnight at room temperature.
Sacculi hydrolysis assay. To test if the LytH complex cleaves peptidoglycan crosslinks,
hydrolysis of purified sacculi was monitored over time. Sacculi was prepared from stationaryphase cells of S. aureus strain HG003 using a previously published protocol46, with the following
modifications. Volumes of solutions were scaled appropriately for the number of cells harvested.
After 1 M HCl treatment, the pellets were washed with dH2O, flash-frozen, and lyophilized to
yield purified sacculi.
A 0.5 mg/mL solution of sacculi was prepared in reaction buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5,
150 mM NaCl, 0.02% DDM, 60 μM Zn(OAc)2). The sacculi hydrolysis assay was set up in nontreated 96-well plates (Genesee Scientific). To each well, 150 μL of sacculi solution was added.
Lysostaphin (dissolved in dH2O) or the purified LytH-ActH complex (stored in 50 mM HEPES,
pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.05% DDM) was mixed with the sacculi substrate.
Reactions were prepared in triplicate using 0-125 nM of purified protein per reaction. The plate
was covered with a lid and incubated at 25°C with shaking. Absorbance (OD600) was recorded at
20-min intervals for 20 hr using a SpectraMax Plus 384 microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular
Devices). Hydrolysis of sacculi was monitored over time as a decrease in absorbance.
LC-MS analysis to assess LytH activity. A previously published method was adapted to detect
the products of LytH enzymatic activity by LC-MS19. Briefly, 1X reaction buffer (50 mM HEPES,
pH 7.5, 10 mM CaCl2, 60 μM Zn(OAc)2), Lipid II (40 μM), and SgtBWT (2 μM) were combined
in a final volume of 10-30 μL (10% DMSO). S. aureus native Lipid II or synthetic Lipid II was
used. The reactions were incubated at room temperature for 1 hr and then quenched at 100°C for
5 min. LytHWT-ActH or LytHD195A-ActH (2 μM) was added and the reactions were incubated at
room temperature for 16 hr. The reactions were quenched at 100°C for 5 min and incubated with
4 U of mutanolysin for 1.5 hr at 37°C on an orbital shaker (300 rpm), followed by another 4 U of
mutanolysin for 1.5 hr at 37°C. The muropeptides were reduced with NaBH4 (10-30 μL of 10
mg/mL solution in H2O) for 30 min at room temperature, and 20% phosphoric acid (~1.4-5 μL)
was added to adjust the pH to ~4. The mixtures were lyophilized and redissolved in 20 μL of H2O,
and 15 μL was injected for LC-MS separation using the same method as described above.
Isolation of lytH suppressor mutants and whole-genome sequencing. Suppressor mutants of
ΔlytH at 42°C on TSA spotting assay plates were independently isolated. These candidate
suppressor colonies were picked and restreaked on TSA to confirm growth at 42°C. Overnight
cultures of the suppressor mutants were inoculated, genomic DNA was prepared from these
cultures, and the DNA concentration was measured with the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit
(ThermoFisher Scientific). The genomic DNA was prepared for whole-genome sequencing using
a previously published method10, with the following modifications. Tagmented samples were
pooled and analyzed by TapeStation and quantitative PCR at the Biopolymers Facility, Harvard

Medical School. Sequencing was performed on the Illumina MiSeq platform using the MiSeq v3
150 cycle Reagent Kit (Illumina). Sequencing reads were analyzed using Geneious version 9.1.5.
The suppressor mutants were compared to the parental S. aureus HG003 ΔlytH deletion strain to
identify single nucleotide polymorphisms and deletion and insertion mutations that were unique
to the suppressor mutants. The NCTC8325 genome was used as the reference genome.
Overexpression and purification of PBP2. E. coli BL21(DE3) was transformed with plasmid
pET42a(+)-pbp2 encoding S. aureus PBP2WT [K60-S716] with a C-terminal His8 tag or plasmid
pTD48 encoding PBP2F158L [K60-S716]-His8. These proteins were expressed and purified as
reported previously17. PBP2S398G and PBP2E114Q were prepared in the same way23. To confirm that
purified PBP2 was properly folded, a Bocillin-binding assay was used as reported previously19.
Briefly, PBP2 (250 nM) was incubated with varying concentrations of penicillin G (1000, 100, 0
U/mL) in 1X buffer (20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl) in a 9 μL reaction for
1 hr at 37°C on an orbital shaker (600 rpm). Bocillin-FL (1 μL of 100 μM stock) was then added
and the reactions were incubated for 30 min at 37°C on an orbital shaker (600 rpm). Reactions
were quenched by addition of an equal volume of 2X SDS loading buffer and analyzed by SDSPAGE. The gel was imaged on a Typhoon FLA 9500 and analyzed using ImageJ.
BDL-labeling assay to assess PBP2 activity. A previously published method17 was adapted to
assess PBP2 activity. Briefly, 1X reaction buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mM CaCl2), BDL
(3 mM), Lipid II (10 μM), and PBP2 (1 μM) were combined in a final volume of 10 μL (10%
DMSO). The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 5-15 min and then heat-quenched at
100°C for 1 min. As appropriate, lysostaphin was added to resolve highly-crosslinked
peptidoglycan: 0.5 μL of lysostaphin (1 mg/mL stock) was added and the reactions were incubated
at 37°C for 3 hr on an orbital shaker (300 rpm). Reactions were quenched by addition of an equal
volume of 2X SDS loading buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting analysis with
streptavidin as described above.
LC-MS analysis of crosslinked muropeptides by different polymerases. Native S. aureus Lipid
II (25 µM) was incubated with i. SgtB (1 µM), ii. the transpeptidase-inactive PBP2S398G (1 µM),
or iii. PBP2WT (2 µM) in a 20 µl reaction containing 20% DMSO and 1X reaction buffer (50 mM
HEPES, pH 6.5, 2.5 mM MgCl2). For i. and ii., the polymerase was heat-inactivated at 95°C for 5
min after a 2-hr incubation at room temperature; after cooling to room temperature, the
glycosyltransferase-inactive PBP2E114Q (1 µM) was added and the reactions were incubated at
room temperature for an additional 2 hr alongside reaction iii. All reactions were then heatinactivated at 95°C for 5 min. After cooling to room temperature, mutanolysin (1 U) was added to
each reaction for 1.5 hr at 37°C followed by another 1 U aliquot for 1.5 hr. The cleaved
disaccharide fragments were then reduced with NaBH4 treatment (10 µL of 10 mg/mL solution in
H2O) for 30 minutes. Phosphoric acid (20%, 1.4 µL) was added to each reaction to adjust the pH
to 4, and then the mixture was lyophilized and re-dissolved in 20 µl H2O for LC/MS analysis,
conducted with ESI-MS operating in positive mode on a Bruker qTOF mass spectrometer. The
same column and method as for muropeptide analysis were used.
Fluorescent vancomycin labeling to measure cell size. A previously published method10 was
adapted for fluorescent vancomycin (Van-FL) labeling of live S. aureus cells for fluorescence
microscopy. Overnight cultures were diluted to a starting OD600 of 0.02 in 20 mL TSB, grown at

37°C with aeration to mid-log phase, and normalized to the same OD600. To 1 mL of cells, 1 µL
of a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of 0.5 mg/mL fluorescent vancomycin and 0.5 mg/mL vancomycinhydrochloride was added. The cells were labeled for 5 min at room temperature, with foil covering
the tubes to protect the reactions from light. The cells were centrifuged (4000 xg, 1 min, 25°C),
washed once with 200 µL 1X PBS, pH 7.4, and resuspended in 75-100 µL of 1X PBS, pH 7.4.
Cell volumes were calculated using only non-dividing cells without a visible septum.
Fluorescent D-lysine labeling to visualize sites of transpeptidase activity. A previously
published method41 was adapted for fluorescent D-lysine (FDL) labeling of live S. aureus cells for
fluorescence microscopy. Overnight cultures were diluted to a starting OD600 of 0.02 in 20 mL
TSB, grown at 37°C with aeration to mid-log phase, and normalized to the same OD600. One mL
of culture was centrifuged (4000 xg, 1 min, 25°C), and the cell pellet was resuspended in 500 μL
of TSB. To the resuspended cells, 100 μM FDL was added and the cells were labeled for 10 min
at 37°C on an orbital shaker (300 rpm), with foil covering the tubes to protect the reactions from
light. The cells were centrifuged (4000 xg, 1 min, 25°C), washed twice with 200 μL 1X PBS, pH
7.4, and resuspended in 50 μL of 1X PBS, pH 7.4.
Labeling of nascent peptidoglycan. A published method25 was used to label newly synthesized
peptidoglycan in live S. aureus cells for fluorescence microscopy. Strains were grown overnight
in TSB containing excess D-serine (0.125 M). Overnight cultures were diluted to a starting OD600
of 0.02 in 3 mL of the same medium and grown at 37°C with aeration to mid-log phase. All 3 mL
of cells were centrifuged (5000 xg, 1 min, 25°C), washed once with 200 μL of TSB, and
resuspended in 3 mL of TSB without D-serine supplemented. Cultures were then incubated for 20
min on a shaker at room temperature to allow incorporation of D-alanine into the cell wall. One to
two mL of culture were centrifuged (4000 xg, 1 min, 25°C), and the cell pellet was resuspended
in 500 μL of TSB. To the resuspended cells, 0.5 µL of a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of 0.15 mg/mL
fluorescent vancomycin and 0.15 mg/mL vancomycin-hydrochloride was added. The cells were
labeled for 5 min at room temperature, with foil covering the tubes to protect from light. The cells
were centrifuged (4000 xg, 1 min, 25°C), washed once with 200 µL 1X PBS, pH 7.4, and
resuspended in 50 µL of 1X PBS, pH 7.4.
Visualization of fluorescent fusion proteins. To assess GFP-PBP2 localization, the strains
TD261, TD262, and TD263 were used. To assess FtsZ55-56sGFP localization, the strains TD268,
TD269, and TD282 were used. To assess GFP-PBP2 and FtsZ-mCherry colocalization, the strains
TD278 and TD279 were used. All strains were grown in TSB overnight; 10 μg/mL erythromycin
was added for FtsZ55-56sGFP strains to maintain the plasmid. Overnight cultures were diluted to a
starting OD600 of 0.02 in 3 mL TSB. For strains TD263, TD278, and TD279, the medium was
supplemented with 0.4 μM of the inducer anhydrotetracycline. For FtsZ55-56sGFP strains5, the
medium was supplemented with 10 μg/mL erythromycin and 0.1 μM of the inducer CdCl2.
Cultures were grown at 37°C or 42°C with aeration to mid-log phase. One to two mL of cells were
centrifuged (4000 xg, 1 min, 25°C), washed once with 200 μL 1X PBS, pH 7.4, and resuspended
in 50 μL of 1X PBS, pH 7.4.
Wide-field epifluorescence microscopy. Cells were spotted onto a thin 2% agarose pad prepared
using 1X PBS, pH 7.4. A 1.5 cover slip was used and Valap sealant (equal weight of petroleum
jelly, lanolin, and paraffin) was applied to seal all sides of the cover slip. Cells were imaged using

brightfield, phase-contrast, and wide-field epifluorescence microscopy at the MicRoN
(Microscopy Resources On the North Quad) facility, Harvard Medical School. Images were
obtained using a Nikon Ti inverted microscope fitted with a custom-made cage incubator set at
30°C, a Nikon motorized stage with an OkoLab gas incubator and a slide insert attachment, an
Andor Zyla 4.2 Plus sCMOS camera, Lumencore SpectraX LED Illumination, Plan Apo lambda
100x/1.45 Oil Ph3 DM objective lens, and Nikon Elements 4.30 acquisition software. The
microscope was fitted with Chroma ET filter cubes in a motorized filter turret: DAPI (49000), CFP
(49001), GFP (49002), YFP (49003), and mCherry (49008). The following exposure times were
used: 50 ms (FDL labeling), 100-200 ms (Van-FL labeling), 100 ms (FtsZ-mCherry), and 5 s
(GFP-PBP2 and FtsZ55-56sGFP). Images were analyzed using the software FIJI and MATLAB
scripts developed in-house.
Semi-automated image analysis. S. aureus cell volumes were estimated using StaphSizer, a
home-built MATLAB code, which was also used to categorize cellular phenotypes. Segmentation
of cell clusters was performed on brightfield images using a watershedding algorithm48. First,
brightfield images were used to create a binary image, to which a Euclidean distance transform
function49-51 was applied to obtain an image whose centers corresponded to the cell regions within
clusters of cells. Local minima that are not centered within the cells in the distance transform image
were filtered out to prevent oversegmentation. Finally, the watershed algorithm was applied to the
modified distance transform image to obtain the ridge lines that define the borders between
neighboring cells. From this segmented image output, the x-y coordinates of each pixel on the cell
boundary were obtained.
To sort cells based on phenotypes, the calculated cell boundary was overlaid on top of the
Van-FL fluorescence image and paired with its corresponding brightfield image to enable visual
inspection of each cell. A 2-dimensional ellipse function was fitted to each cell boundary to
calculate the lengths of the major and minor axes of the ellipse. To estimate the volume, S. aureus
geometry was modeled as a prolate spheroid52 with the following volume equation:
𝑉=

4
𝜋𝑎𝑏 )
3

Where V is the volume, a is half of the major (longer) axis, and b is half of the minor (shorter)
axis of each fitted cell. Cell volumes were calculated using approximately 700 non-dividing cells
without a septum. P-values were determined by two-sided Mann-Whitney U tests.
The ratio of fluorescence intensity at the septum vs. periphery (Fseptum/Fperiphery) for selected
cells was calculated using FreehandPeriSep, a home-built MATLAB code. After background
correction, the coordinates of the boundary of a cell with a single complete septum were defined
by the user manually tracing on a phase-contrast image. The coordinates of the user-defined region
of interest (ROI) were used to create a binary mask that encompasses the entire cell (outer ROI).
To obtain the fluorescence signal at the septum (septum ROI) in the same cell, the user manually
traces the septum on the corresponding fluorescence image. To obtain the fluorescence signal at
the cell periphery (periphery ROI), an inner ROI containing the septum and cytoplasm in the cell
was first obtained by eroding the original binary mask such that the peripheral region is excluded;
this inner ROI was then subtracted from the outer ROI. Finally, the periphery and septum ROIs
were used to retrieve all pixel values at the cell periphery and septum, respectively. Only 50% of
the brightest pixels at the septum and at the cell periphery were considered to avoid inclusion of

The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC)5 between two fluorescence channels was
calculated using FreehandPCC, a home-built MATLAB code. A higher PCC indicates a greater
degree of colocalization between GFP-PBP2 and FtsZ-mCherry in a strain. Only cells showing
FtsZ signal at the septum were considered for PCC analysis. The coordinates of the boundary of a
cell were defined by the user manually tracing on a phase-contrast image. These coordinates were
used to isolate images of chosen cells from the two background-corrected fluorescence channels.
The PCC between the channels were obtained using the built-in MATLAB function corr2, which
calculates the 2-D correlation coefficient of two images of size m-by-n with the following
equation:
𝑟=

882

∑@ ∑A(𝐴@A − 𝐴̅)(𝐵@A − 𝐵F)

Where Amn and Bmn are the pixel intensities for the two fluorescence channels, and 𝐴̅ and 𝐵F
are the mean intensities of those channels. Data are represented as box-and-whisker plots in which
the line inside the box indicates the median PCC, and the bottom and top edges of the box indicate
the 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively. Whiskers are drawn to the minimum and maximum
PCC. P-values were determined by two-sided Mann-Whitney U tests.

Figure 3: The LytH-ActH complex cleaves stem peptides from uncrosslinked peptidoglycan.

1059

a, LytH-ActH removes stem peptides from uncrosslinked glycan strands synthesized in vitro.

1060

Glycan strands were labeled with biotin-D-Lys (BDL, yellow spheres), separated by SDS-PAGE,

1061

and immunodetected with streptavidin. LytH* denotes the catalytic mutant LytHD195A. b,

1062

Uncrosslinked glycan strands containing a [14C]-radiolabel in the glycan backbone undergo a

1063

downward mass shift upon LytH-ActH removal of stem peptides. c, LC-MS analysis confirmed

1064

that LytH-ActH releases stem peptides from uncrosslinked polymers. d, LytH-ActH did not

1065

detectably cleave peptidoglycan crosslinks. Uncrosslinked and crosslinked polymers labeled with

1066

a [14C]-disaccharide on the polymer backbone were treated with the complex; a mass shift

1067

indicating cleavage was only observed for uncrosslinked polymers. The lysostaphin control

1068

cleaved crosslinks.

Figure 4: Slowing peptidoglycan synthesis compensates for loss of LytH. a, FtsZ was

1072

frequently mislocalized in the absence of LytH (arrows). Quantitation of FtsZ-sGFP localization

1073

(~1500 cells/strain): at midcell where a nascent or complete septum was formed (Class A); as

1074

peripheral puncta or at multiple septa (Class B). The suppressor allele pbp2F158L (pbp2*) corrected

1075

DlytH defects. Scale bars, 1 μm. b, High-temperature (42°C) sensitivity of lytH deletion was

1076

suppressed (arrow) by reducing PBP2 activity. Purified PBP2 and a representative variant,

1077

PBP2F158L (PBP2*), were incubated with Lipid II to assess polymerization activity. c, Reducing

1078

peptidoglycan synthesis activity pharmacologically suppressed ∆lytH high-temperature

1079

sensitivity. Moenomycin inhibits PBP2.

Figure 5: LytH regulates peripheral peptidoglycan synthesis. a, Cells were labeled with

1085

fluorescent D-lysine (FDL) to mark sites of transpeptidase activity; DlytH cells showed increased

1086

peripheral signal. Fluorescence ratios were calculated in cells with a single complete septum (mean

1087

± SEM for ~160 cells/strain). All p-values were determined by two-sided Mann-Whitney U tests.

1088

***P < 0.001. b, Newly-synthesized peptidoglycan was labeled with fluorescent vancomycin

1089

(Van-FL); an increase in peripheral signal was observed for DlytH cells (mean ± SEM for ~280

1090

cells/strain). c, PBP2 was frequently mislocalized in the absence of LytH (arrows). Quantitation

1091

of GFP-PBP2 localization: at midcell in dividing cells (Class A); around the membrane (Class B);

1092

at misplaced septa and/or punctate foci (Class C). Scale bars, 1 µm. d, GFP-PBP2 and FtsZ-

depicted as box-and-whisker plots (~50 cells/strain). The central line indicates the median, and the

Figure 6: LytH coordinates cell growth with cell division. Model for LytH function. Control of

1100

cell size is required for FtsZ localization at midcell to properly initiate division. Free stem peptides

1101

limit rapid diffusion of PBP2 to midcell during division, leading to increased cell size due to excess

1102

peripheral peptidoglycan synthesis. LytH regulates stem peptide abundance on membrane-

1103

proximal peptidoglycan: in its absence, cells enlarge, FtsZ becomes mislocalized, and division

1104

initiates at aberrant sites.
