In Brief
Topoisomerase DNA-protein crosslinks (TOP-DPCs) are the therapeutic mechanism of
clinical TOP inhibitors (camptothecin and etoposide). TOP-DPCs induce rapid and
sequential conjugation of SUMO-2/3- SUMO-1 and ubiquitin catalyzed by activation of
PIAS4 through its DNA-binding SAP domain and RNF4 through its SIM domains. This
SUMO-ubiquitin cascade triggers proteasomal degradation of TOP-DPCs.

Abortive topoisomerase I (TOP1) and II (TOP2) cleavage complexes resulting in DNAprotein crosslinks (TOP-DPCs) are rapidly and sequentially modified by SUMO-2/3, SUMO1 and ubiquitin before their proteasomal degradation.
PIAS4 SUMOylates TOP-DPCs via its DNA-binding SAP domain independently of DNA
transactions and DNA damage responses.
RNF4 ubiquitylates SUMOylated TOP-DPCs and drives their proteasomal degradation.
TOP-DPC processing by the SUMO-Ub pathways is conserved in yeast and human cells.

SUMMARY
Topoisomerase cleavage complexes (TOPccs) can be stalled physiologically and by the
anticancer drugs camptothecins (TOP1 inhibitors) and etoposide (TOP2 inhibitor), yielding
irreversible TOP DNA-protein crosslinks (TOP-DPCs). Here we elucidate how TOP-DPCs are
degraded via the SUMO-ubiquitin (Ub) pathway. We show that in human cells, TOP-DPCs are
promptly and sequentially conjugated by SUMO-2/3, SUMO-1 and Ub. SUMOylation is catalyzed
by the SUMO ligase PIAS4, which forms a complex with both TOP1 and TOP2a and b. RNF4
acts as the SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase (STUbL) for both TOP1- and TOP2-DPCs in a SUMOdependent but replication/transcription-independent manner. This SUMO-Ub pathway is
conserved in yeast with Siz1 the ortholog of PIAS4 and Slx5-Slx8 the ortholog of RNF4. Our study
reveals a conserved SUMO-dependent ubiquitylation pathway for proteasomal degradation of
both TOP1- and TOP2-DPCs and potentially for other DPCs.
INTRODUCTION
DNA is constantly undergoing damage from endogenous and exogenous sources (Lindahl, 1993),
which compromises genome integrity (Hoeijmakers, 2009). Endogenous DNA lesions are highly
diverse, ranging from abasic sites, chemical adducts, single- and double-strand breaks (SSBs
and DSBs) and DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) (Friedberg et al., 2014). Intrinsic defects in DNA
repair systems leads to carcinogenesis, neurodegeneration, immunodeficiency and other
deleterious consequences (Jackson and Bartek, 2009). Repair mechanisms specialized for DPCs
are a current focus of investigation (Larsen et al., 2019; Stingele et al., 2017).
A ubiquitous mechanism for DPC formation is through the action of topoisomerases (TOPs).
TOP1 and TOP2 cleave one or both strands of the DNA, respectively, through transient covalent
linkage between their catalytic tyrosine residue and the phosphate group of the DNA backbone
(3’-end for TOP1 and 5’-end for TOP2), leading to formation of TOP-DNA cleavage complexes
(TOPccs). Upon re-ligation of the DNA, TOPs are released from the DNA (Pommier et al., 2016;
Vos et al., 2011). Failure in the re-ligation step results in persistent TOPccs (TOP-DPCs) that
interfere with DNA metabolisms upon collisions with DNA and RNA polymerases. Although TOP1
and TOP2 are distinct proteins in terms of their sizes, structures and catalytic mechanisms, TOPDPCs can stem from topoisomerase malfunctions (Fertala et al., 2000; Pouliot et al., 1999), as
well as preexisting DNA lesions such as abasic sites, oxidative damage, mismatches,
ribonucleotide misincorporation and strand breaks (Pommier et al., 2016). TOP-DPCs are also
induced therapeutically by the anticancer agents camptothecin (CPT) derivatives (TOP1 poisons)
and etoposide (ETP), doxorubicin or amsacrine (TOP2 poisons).
TOP-DPC-specific repair mechanisms are generally categorized into two classes: nucleolytic
cleavage and proteolytic degradation. The first class is exemplified by tyrosine-DNA

phosphodiesterases (TDPs) that hydrolyze the covalent tyrosine-DNA bond, with TDP1 excising
TOP1-DPCs (Pouliot et al., 1999) and TDP2 excising TOP2-DPCs in higher eukaryotes (Cortes
Ledesma et al., 2009). In additions to TDPs, endonucleases such as Mre11 and XPF have been
reported to play a key role in removing both TOP-DPCs presumably by incising the DNA adjacent
to the TOP-DPC (Aparicio et al., 2016; Pommier et al., 2016; Sasanuma et al., 2018). Proteolytic
degradation is required for TDP activities and earlier work showed that the ubiquitin (Ub)proteasome pathway (UPP) plays an important role in proteolyzing TOP-DPCs (Desai et al., 1997;
Mao et al., 2001). Yet, the detailed molecular mechanisms by which the UPP targets TOP-DPCs
are still poorly understood. In addition, small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMO) 1 and 2/3 have been
implicated in TOP-DPC repair (Agostinho et al., 2008; Kanagasabai et al., 2009; Mao et al., 2000a;
Mao et al., 2000b), but the functions of these modifications still remain elusive.
SUMOylation has been linked to ubiquitylation, as polymeric SUMO chains can serve as mark
for recognition by SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligases (STUbLs) that attach Ub moieties on polySUMOylated substrates to promote their proteasomal degradation (Poulsen et al., 2013; Tatham
et al., 2008; van Hagen et al., 2010). SUMO-Ub pathways orchestrate the proteolytic turnover of
DNA damage response (DDR) and repair enzymes to facilitate DNA repair in mammalian cells
(Jackson and Durocher, 2013; Ulrich, 2012). The Siz/PIAS RING family SUMO ligases PIAS1
and PIAS4 mediate SUMOylation as an early response to DNA damage by modifying DDR
proteins including MDC1, RPA and 53BP1 to enable their recruitment to DNA damage sites
(Galanty et al., 2009). Among STUbLs, RNF4 is implicated in the ubiquitylation and proteolysis of
SUMOylated substrates to ensure DSB repair (Galanty et al., 2012; Vyas et al., 2013; Yin et al.,
2012). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the PIAS family orthologs Siz1 and Siz2 as well as the RNF4
ortholog Slx5-Slx8 heterocomplex engage in DNA repair to ensure genome stability (Heideker et
al., 2011; Jalal et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2006b).
Here we dissect the involvement of SUMO, Ub and the proteasome in the repair of TOP-DPCs.
We elucidate the SUMO-Ub axis in yeast with Siz1 responsible for TOP1- and TOP2-DPC
SUMOylation and ubiquitylation by Slx5-Slx8. Using a novel assay for detection of ubiquitylated
and SUMOylated TOP-DPCs (DUST), we show for the first time that TOP1- and TOP2-DPCs are
promptly modified by SUMO-2/3, SUMO-1 and Ub in a sequential order in human cells. We
identify human PIAS4 as the major SUMO ligase for both TOP1- and TOP2-DPCs. We also show
that RNF4 is the STUbL for TOP-DPCs in human cells, which drives their proteasomal
degradation.
RESULTS
SUMO-Ub Axis and Proteasome Repair of TOP-DPC in Yeast
The UPP pathway is conserved in eukaryotes and ubiquitin ligases that specifically recognize
SUMOylated proteins have been discovered in species ranging from yeasts to humans
(Sriramachandran and Dohmen, 2014). To investigate whether UPP is involved in the processing
of TOP-DPCs, Western blotting (WB) was carried out in the yeast S. cerevisiae strain YMM10
overexpressing HA-tagged yeast TOP1 or TOP2. The results revealed that CPT and ETP induce
partial loss of cellular TOP1 and TOP2 (Figure S1A, B), which was blocked by the proteasome
inhibitor MG132, indicating TOP proteasomal degradation upon TOP-DPC formation. Clonogenic
assays showed that MG132 rendered TOP1- and TOP2-overexpressing cells hypersensitive to
CPT and ETP, respectively (Figure S1C, D). These results demonstrate the proteasome as a
conserved pathway for the repair of TOP-induced DNA damage.
We next examined whether yeast TOPs are modified by Ub and SUMO upon DPC
formation. HA-antibody immunoprecipitation (IP) showed that both TOP1 and TOP2 are
conjugated with polymeric Ub and smt3 (yeast SUMO-1) at steady-state, and that addition of CPT
or ETP enhanced formation of smt3- and Ub-TOP conjugates (Figure 1A, B). As IP of cellular

lysates cannot distinguish between free TOPs and TOP-DPCs, we developed an approach to
detect DPC post translational modifications (PTMs). We modified and adapted the classical in
vivo complex of enzyme (ICE) assay (Anand et al., 2018; Subramanian et al., 1995). In brief, we
digested the isolated TOP-DPCs with micrococcal nuclease and resolved the DPCs by SDSPAGE gel electrophoresis, followed by immunoblotting (IB) to assess TOP-DPC and their PTMs
using specific antibodies. Both TOP1- and TOP2-DPCs as well as their ubiquitylation and
SUMOylation were detected in the absence of TOP inhibitors, presumably as a result of
overexpression of TOPs (Figure 1C, D). Treatment with CPT and ETP further induced TOP-DPCs
and MG132 stimulated TOP-DPC accumulation, indicating a role of the proteasome in eliminating
TOP-DPCs. Concurrently, TOP inhibitor treatments increased the levels of smt3- and Ub-TOPDPCs, which were further increased by proteasome inhibition.
To investigate whether TOP-DPC SUMOylation plays a role in TOP-DPC ubiquitylation,
we transformed YMM10 strain with the top1 K65, 91, 92R (top1-3KR) (Chen et al., 2007) or top2
Sumo No More (top2-SNM) (Bachant et al., 2002) constructs, both of which comprise mutations
disrupting their respective SUMO consensus sites. Both the top1K65,91, 92R allele and top2 SNM
allele showed a substantial decrease of SUMO-TOP-DPCs compared with the strains harboring
the wild-type (WT) plasmids (Figure 1E, F, Figure S1E, F). Notably, deficiency in SUMOylation
brought about marked reduction in both TOP1- and 2- DPC ubiquitylation, suggesting that
SUMOylation licenses TOP-DPC for ubiquitylation in yeast.
Siz1 and Slx5/Slx8 are SUMO ligase and STUbL for TOP-DPCs in Yeast
To identify the SUMO ligase(s) and STUbL(s) for TOP-DPC, we performed ICE assays in yeast
strains lacking SUMO ligases and STUbLs involved in DNA damage repair in yeast. Deletion of
the genes encoding the STUbL Slx5-Slx8 complex decreased TOP-DPC ubiquitylation (Figure 1g,
h). Comparing slx5 null and slx8 null strains, slx8Δ displayed lower Ub-TOP-DPC levels than the
slx5Δ strains (Figure 1G, H), consistent with a study showing that Slx8 rather than Slx5 mediates
dsDNA binding activity of the complex (Yang et al., 2006a). Also, the slx5Δ and slx8Δ strains both
showed elevated TOP-DPC SUMOylation, suggesting a role of Slx5-Slx8 in processing
SUMOylated TOP-DPCs. Deletion of gene encoding SUMO ligase SIZ1 but not SIZ2 substantially
reduced not only SUMOylation of TOP-DPCs but also their ubiquitylation (Figure 1G, H, Figure
S1G, H), supporting the conclusion that SUMOylation prompts TOP-DPC ubiquitylation.
Because Tdp1 is a critical enzyme for excising TOP-DPCs, we assessed its relationship
with Siz1, Slx5 and Tdp1. slx5∆ tdp1∆ and siz1∆ tdp1∆ double-mutants exhibited higher TOPDPC levels than those in the respective single mutants (Figure 1I, J, Figure S1I, J). TOP-DPC
levels were comparable in slx5∆ siz1∆ double-mutant and in slx5∆ and siz1∆ single-mutants,
suggesting the epistasis of Siz1 and Slx5 in TOP-DPC repair. Next, we compared the sensitivity
of the mutants to TOP inhibitors by spotting cultures onto plates containing CPT or TOP2 inhibitor
amsacrine (Figure 1k, l). Substantially reduced growth of slx5∆ tdp1∆ and siz1∆ tdp1∆ doublemutant strains can be seen on the drug plates (Figure 1K, L). Taken together, these observations
indicate redundant roles of Siz1-Slx5 and Tdp1 in removing TOP-DPCs in yeast.
SUMO-, Ub- and Proteasome-dependent processing of TOP-DPCs in human cells
We next sought to examine the UPP-dependent repair of TOP-DPCs in human cells. First, we
assessed the proteasomal degradation of TOP1, TOP2α and TOP2β in CPT- or ETP-treated
human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells in the presence of MG132 and the Ub-activating enzyme
(UAE) inhibitor TAK-243 (Hyer et al., 2018). CPT or ETP treatments for 4 h led to a marked
reduction of TOP1, TOP2α and TOP2β levels (Figure 2A, B, lanes 1-4), and both MG-132 and
TAK-243 blocked CPT-induced TOP1 degradation and ETP-induced TOP2α and β degradation
(Figure 2A, B, lanes 5, 6), demonstrating UPP-dependent destruction of cellular TOPs in response
to TOP poisoning. ICE assays showed that MG132 or TAK-243 increased CPT-induced TOP1-

DPC and ETP-induced TOP2-DPC levels (Figure 2C-H), suggesting that UPP targets TOP-DPCs
for the destruction.
We then intended to establish a role of SUMOylation in TOP-DPC processing. Utilizing
ML-792, an inhibitor of the SUMO-activating enzyme SAE (He et al., 2017), we found that
inhibiting SUMOylation blocked drug-induced loss of TOPs (Figure 2A, B, lanes 7) while
increasing TOP-DPCs (Figure S2C-H). Using an antibody that selectively recognizes TOP1-DPCs
(Patel et al., 2016), immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy showed that inhibition of the proteasome,
ubiquitylation or SUMOylation increased TOP1-DPCs (Figure 2I, J), corroborating the
involvement of SUMOylation, ubiquitylation and proteasome in TOP1-DPC resolution.
Upon exposure to TOP inhibitors, induction of γH2AX, a marker for DSBs (Bonner et al.,
2008) requires proteolysis, as evidenced by the observation that the MG132 blocks TOP inhibitorinduced γH2AX foci formation (Lin et al., 2009; Schellenberg et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2006a).
Pre-treatment with TAK-243 or ML-792 also reduced CPT- and ETP-induced γH2AX foci (Figure
S2K-N), implying a role of SUMOylation and ubiquitylation in signaling downstream from TOPDPCs.
Rapid and Sequential SUMOylation and Ubiquitylation of TOP-DPCs in Human Cells
To investigate whether Ub and SUMO modify TOP-DPCs for repair in human cells, we performed
pull-down experiments by transiently transfecting TOPs in HEK293 cells. His-tagged TOP1 was
found conjugated with SUMO-2/3 and Ub at baseline, and CPT enhanced its SUMO-1, SUMO2/3, and Ub modifications (Figure 3A). Proteasome inhibition by MG132 further stimulated TOP1
SUMOylation and ubiquitylation. Similarly, IP of FLAG-tagged TOP2α and TOPβ showed that
TOP2 isozymes are SUMO-2/3-, SUMO-1- and Ub-conjugated at baseline, and that treatment
with ETP enhanced their SUMOylation and ubiquitylation, which were increased upon cotreatment with MG132 (Figure 3B).
To assess whether TOP SUMOylation plays a role in its ubiquitylation, we transfected the
TOP1-CPT3KR (K117R, K153R and K103R) construct, which is deficient in SUMOylation due to
disruption of its SUMO-consensus motifs (Figure 3C) (Horie et al., 2002; Li et al., 2015). Those
mutations not only impaired SUMOylation but also ubiquitylation of TOP1 (Figure 3D), indicating
that SUMOylation of TOP1 engages the UPP. The TOP1 catalytic dead (Y723F) mutant (Figure
3C) also underwent SUMO-1 and SUMO-2/3 modifications, albeit to a lesser extent than TOP1
WT (Figure 3D) (Horie et al., 2002). As the Y723F mutant lacking DNA cleavage activity is still
capable of binding DNA, this result implies that TOP1 binding is sufficient to elicit its SUMOylation.
To demonstrate that TOP1- and TOP2-DPCs are directly conjugated with SUMO-1,
SUMO-2/3 and Ub, we performed high performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass
spectrum (HPLC-MS/MS) following ICE assay to isolate DNA after treatment of HEK293 cells with
CPT or ETP. The MS analysis confirmed that CPT selectively induced TOP1-DPCs and ETP
selectively induced TOP2α- and TOP2β-DPCs (Figure 3E), and that SUMO-1, SUMO-2 and Ub
were detected in the CPT- and ETP-treated but not vehicle (DMSO)-treated samples.
To directly assess the SUMO and Ub modifications of TOP-DPCs in human cells, we
developed an assay for the detection of ubiquitylated and SUMOylated TOP-DPCs (DUST)
derived from the RADAR assay (Kiianitsa and Maizels, 2013) (Figure 3F). Briefly, cells treated
with TOP poisons (CPT or ETP) are lysed with DNAzol followed by ethanol precipitation. Nucleic
acids are collected and digested by micrococcal nuclease. Released TOP-DPCs are resolved by
SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and SUMO- and Ub-TOP-DPCs were detected by IB. This DUST
assay showed that TOP-DPCs form instantly (within 10 min) after addition of TOP inhibitors
(Figure 3G, H, bottom panels), reaching a peak at 30 min, and gradually decreased to become
undetectable after 4 hours. SUMO-2/3, SUMO-1 and Ub modifications peaked sequentially (at 10
min, 30 min and 1 h, respectively), indicating that the consecutive SUMO-2/3, SUMO-1 and Ub
are conjugated to TOP-DPCs in coordination with each other and with the clearance of TOP-

DPCs. In addition, the DUST assays showed that total TOP-DPCs and the PTM-modified TOPDPCs are induced by TOP inhibitors in a dose-dependent manner (Figure S2A, B).
As both TOP2α and TOP2β are trapped by ETP, the Ub- and SUMO-TOP2-DPCs
presumably represent a mixed population comprising both TOP2α- and TOP2β-DPCs. To
examine TOP2α and TOP2β separately, we performed DUST assays in WT and TOP2B CRISPR
knockout (KO) HeLa cells treated with or without TOP2A siRNA knockdown (KD). Both TOP2αand TOP2β-DPCs were found to be SUMOylated and ubiquitinylated upon ETP treatment (Figure
S2C).
SUMO and Ub Linkages of TOP1- and TOP2-DPCs in Human Cells
Ubiquitin can be conjugated through one of its 7 lysine residues (K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48
and K63) with the K48 or the K11 chains leading to proteasomal degradation (Akutsu et al., 2016).
To scrutinize the poly-ubiquitin linkages of TOP-DPCs, we transfected HA-tagged lysine-toarginine mutants for each ubiquitylation residue and performed DUST assays. K11R-, K48R- and
K63R mutations significantly reduced both TOP1- and TOP2-DPC ubiquitylation (Figure S2D, E).
The K48 and the K11 linkages are consistent with subsequent proteasomal degradation of TOPDPCs. Whether the K63 ubiquitylation of TOP-DPCs serves as a platform for the engagement of
DDR proteins remains to be determined (Oh et al., 2018).
Given the established role of K11 of SUMO-2/3 in forming polymeric SUMO-2/3 chain
(Tatham et al., 2001), we transfected HA-tagged SUMO-2 WT and K11R to determine the TOPDPC SUMO-2/3 linkages using the DUST assay. The K11R mutation was observed to result in a
major decrease in SUMO-2 modification of both TOP1- and TOP2-DPCs (Figure S2F, G, lanes
5, 6).
We also investigated the linkage type of the SUMO-1 chains on TOP-DPCs. Due to lack
of internal SUMO consensus motif, it is not well-established whether SUMO-1 by itself is able to
form polymers in vivo. Because biochemical studies have shown that homogenous SUMO-1
polymer can be assembled through its K7 residue (Yang et al., 2006b), we performed DUST
assays in cells transfected with HA-SUMO-1 WT or K7R and found that disruption of the K7
residue did cripple the SUMO-1 polymerization of both TOP1- and TOP2-DPCs (Figure S2F, G,
1, 2).
Acting as an acceptor, SUMO-2/3 moieties can be conjugated with SUMO-1 that
terminates SUMO-2/3 chain elongation (Matic et al., 2008). To explore the interplay between
SUMO-1 and SUMO-2/3, we downregulated SUMO-2/3 in the SUMO-1-transfected cells and
observed shorter forms of SUMO-1-modified TOP-DPCs species (Figure S2F, G, lanes 3).
Conversely, KD of SUMO-1 in SUMO-2-transfected cells led to longer forms of SUMO-2-modified
TOP-DPCs (Figure S2F, G, lanes 7). These results are consistent with SUMO-2/3 and SUMO-1
sequentially targeting TOP-DPCs with SUMO-2/3 first forming polymeric chains on TOP-DPCs,
which are subsequently capped by SUMO-1.
PIAS4 is a SUMO Ligase for both TOP1- and TOP2-DPCs in Human Cells
To identify the SUMO E3 ligase(s) for TOP1-DPCs, we expressed His-tagged TOP1 in HEK293
cells. Following treatment with CPT or DMSO, we purified TOP1 protein complexes using Ni-NTA
to identify co-purifying proteins by LC-MS/MS (Figure 4A, left). Likewise, we expressed FLAGtagged TOP2α and TOP2β in cells treated with ETP or DMSO, performed FLAG-IP and analyzed
TOP2-containing protein complexes by MS (Figure 4A, right). Strikingly, all samples were
consistently enriched with PIAS4 (Figure 3A, bottom), a member of Siz/PIAS SUMO ligase family,
which SUMOylates DDR proteins including RPA and MDC1 for DSB repair (Galanty et al., 2009).
To validate this result, we reciprocally pulled down PIAS4-containing protein complexes by
expressing FLAG-PIAS4 in HEK293 cells. MS retrieved TOP1, TOP2α and TOP2β (Figure 4B).

IP-IB and Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA) also showed that PIAS4 interacts with TOP1 and TOP2
in the presence or absence of TOP inhibitors (Figure S3A-E).
PIAS4 downregulation (Figure S3D) decreased the levels of both SUMO-1- and SUMO2/3-conjugated TOP-DPCs whereas KD of PIAS1, another PIAS family SUMO ligase did not alter
SUMOylation of TOP-DPCs in the DUST assays (Figure 4C, E).
To establish that PIAS4 catalyzes TOP SUMOylation, we performed biochemical assays
in reactions containing SUMO-1 or SUMO-2, SUMO E1, E2, PIAS4 and recombinant
topoisomerases. By probing with anti-SUMO-1 and SUMO-2/3 antibodies, we established that
PIAS4 can catalyze TOP1 with preference for SUMO-1 conjugation over SUMO-2 conjugation
(Figure S4A). Analogously, PIAS4 also catalyzed SUMO-1 and SUMO2 conjugation of TOP2α
and TOP2β (Figure S4B, C)
RNF4 is a STUbL for both TOP1- and TOP2-DPCs in Human Cells
Because PIAS4 KD was also observed to attenuate TOP-DPC ubiquitylation (Figure 4C, E), we
surmised that SUMOylation of TOP-DPC is a trigger for their ubiquitylation. Thus, we tested RNF4
as the human ortholog of Slx5-Slx8 (see above and Figure 1) for TOP-DPC ubiquitylation in
human cells. DUST assays showed that RNF4 KD reduced TOP-DPC ubiquitylation while
enhancing TOP-DPC SUMOylation (Figure 4D, E). Silencing of RNF111, the other reported
mammalian STUbL (Poulsen et al., 2013) did not impact TOP1-DPCs ubiquitylation (Figure 4D).
To validate the activity of RNF4 biochemically, we performed Ub conjugation assays with
recombinant topoisomerases, Ub, Ub E1, RNF4 as well as E2 enzyme UbcH5α, which cooperates
with RNF4 for ubiquitylation (Plechanovova et al., 2012). IB with anti-Ub antibody showed that
TOP ubiquitylation increased in a RNF4-dependent manner (Figure S4D-F). To establish that
RNF4 targets SUMOylated topoisomerases, we performed experiments coupling in vitro
SUMOylation and ubiquitylation. RNF4 displayed much stronger ubiquitylating activity toward
SUMO-modified TOPs than toward unmodified TOPs (Figure S4D-F).
Coordination of PIAS4 and RNF4 for SUMOylation and Ubiquitylation of TOP-DPCs
To explore how PIAS4 and RNF4 coordinate the SUMO-Ub pathway, we overexpressed
PIAS4 and RNF4 in HCT116 cells. DUST assays showed that PIAS4 transfection stimulated both
TOP-DPC SUMOylation and ubiquitylation, and that RNF4 transfection largely potentiated
ubiquitylation of TOP-DPCs (Figure 5A, B, lanes 2, 3). Expression of PIAS4 in PIAS4 CRIPSR
KO HCT116 cells in part restored SUMOylation and ubiquitylation whereas ectopic expression of
RNF4 in PIAS4 KO cells failed to induce TOP-DPC ubiquitylation (Figure 5A, B, lanes 5, 6; Figure
S5A). We conclude that RNF4 ubiquitylates TOP-DPCs in a PIAS4-dependent manner.
PIAS4 has been shown to localize to DSB sites by binding DNA via its N-terminal SAP
domain (Figure 5C, left) in association with DDR proteins (Galanty et al., 2009). Accordingly,
PIAS4 SAPD as well as the PIAS4 catalytic-dead (C342A) transfected MCF7 cells were defective
in TOP-DPC SUMOylation and ubiquitylation (Figure 5D, E, lanes 3, 4, Figure S5C), indicating
that SUMOylation of TOP-DPCs is dependent on the recruitment of PIAS4 to chromatin.
To test whether RNF4 ubiquitylates TOP-DPCs through its SUMO interacting motifs (SIMs)
(Figure 5C, right) (Kung et al., 2014), we transfected RNF4 WT and SIMD plasmids in RNF4 KO
MCF7 cells. The SIM mutant failed to induce TOP-DPC ubiquitylation in RNF4 KO cells as
opposed to the RNF4 WT (Figure 5D, E, lanes 7; Figure S5B, D). Similarly, a RNF4 catalyticdead mutant (H156A) was unable to induce TOP-DPC ubiquitylation in RNF4 KO cells (Figure 5F,
Figure S5D). These results were corroborated by PLA assays showing that PIAS4 SAPD and
RNF4 SIMD fail to colocalize with TOP1 and TOP2α (Figure S5E-F). We conclude that PIAS4 is
recruited to TOP-DPCs through its DNA binding domain and TOP-DPC SUMOylation recruits
RNF4 through its SIM motifs, leading to TOP-DPC ubiquitylation.

Connecting SUMOylation and SUMO-dependent Ubiquitylation of TOP-DPCs with DNA
transactions and DDR in Human Cells
To investigate whether DNA transactions and the DNA damage response (DDR kinases) play a
role in the SUMOylation and ubiquitylation of TOP-DPCs, we performed DUST assays in HEK293
cells treated with the DNA-PKcs inhibitor VX984, the ATM inhibitor KU55399, the ATR inhibitor
AZD6738, the replication inhibitor aphidicolin (APH) or the transcription inhibitor DRB prior to CPT
or ETP treatment. None of the inhibitors affected the SUMOylation of TOP-DPCs (Figure 6A, B),
indicating that TOP-DPC SUMOylation is induced prior to collision between TOP-DPCs and DNA
transaction machineries and activation of DDR. These findings may explain why SUMO
modifications of TOPs transpire within minutes of the DPC formation.
While TOP-DPC SUMOylation was insensitive to ATM, ATR and DNA-PK inhibitors,
ubiquitylation was reduced by replication or transcription inhibition (APH and DRB, Figure 6A, B).
However, APH and DRB did not exhibit any significant impact on TOP-DPC ubiquitylation
potentiated by RNF4 overexpression (Figure 6C, D), implying that there are other ubiquitylation
pathways activated upon collision of replication and transcription with TOP-DPCs (Desai et al.,
2003; Li et al., 2003; Lin et al., 2009; Xiao et al., 2003).
RNF4 Drives the Proteasomal Degradation of TOP-DPCs in Human Cells
To link RNF4-mediated ubiquitylation to TOP-DPC proteasomal degradation, we conducted ICE
assay in MCF WT cells and found that overexpression of RNF4 reduced TOP-DPCs (Figure 7AC; Figure S7A, B). This reduction was suppressed by MG132, indicating that RNF4 induces TOPDPC removal through the proteasome. In addition, MG132 failed to further increase TOP-DPCs
in MCF RNF4 KO cells, suggesting an epistatic relationship between RNF4 and the proteasome
in TOP-DPC removal (Figure 7A-C; Figure S6A, B).
As we determined that TOP-DPCs are mainly modified by Ub at K48 and 63, we tested
which Ub linkage(s) is mediated by RNF4. To do so, we transfected HEK293 cells with single
lysine Ub constructs (the other lysines are converted into arginine) HA-Ub K48 or HA-Ub K63.
Following RNF4 transfection and DUST assays, we found that RNF4 significantly facilitated K48
ubiquitylation but not K63 ubiquitylation of TOP-DPCs (Figure 7D, E). This result suggests that
RNF4 primes TOP-DPCs for proteasomal degradation by catalyzing the K48 poly-ubiquitylation.
Next, we tested potential direct interactions of the proteasome with TOP-DPCs. During
degradation, the proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 14 (PSMD14) deubiquitylates
substrates to enable their access into the proteasome catalytic core (Bard et al., 2018). To
determine whether PSMD14 interacts with TOP-DPCs, we transfected a PSMD14-FLAG
expression plasmid into HEK293 cells and performed IP after MG132 and CPT or ETP cotreatment. We observed multiple bands that have higher molecular weights than the actual TOP1
by IB using anti-TOP1 and -TOP1-DPC antibodies in CPT-treated IP samples (Figure 7F).
Similarly, smeared bands above TOP2 were detected in ETP-treated IP samples using anti-TOP2
antibodies (Figure 7G). As the proteasome lacks deSUMOylating activity, it is conceivable that
SUMO chains conjugated to TOPs are removed before proteasome processing. We conclude
that the observed upper shifted or smeared bands of TOPs indicate poly-Ub-TOP species.
Downregulation of RNF4 largely diminished the interaction (Figure 7F, G), suggesting that
PSMD14 binds RNF4-generated Ub-TOP for deubiquitylation, allowing the entry of TOPs into the
proteasome core particle.
We next transfected HEK293 cells with a plasmid overexpressing the 20S proteasome
core subunit β type-5 (PSMB5) possessing chymotrypsin-like activity. Following MG132 and CPT
or ETP co-treatment, FLAG-IP experiments showed that PSMB5 only interacted with unmodified
TOPs (Figure 7H, I), suggesting that TOPs are translocated to the catalytic core following their
deubiquitylation. KD of RNF4 attenuated the interaction between PSMB5 and TOPs (Figure 7H,

I), substantiating the role of RNF4 in driving the proteasomal degradation of TOP-DPCs. By
probing the CPT-treated IP samples with antibody targeting TOP1-DPC, we confirmed that
PSMB5 interacts TOP-1-DPC in a RNF4-dependend manner, directly suggesting that the 20S
core complex targets covalent DNA-bound TOPs for proteolysis. As proteasome inhibition
precludes gH2AX induction by TOP-DPCs presumably by perpetuating non-proteolyzed TOPDPCs that conceal the TOP-linked DSBs, we examined whether PIAS4 and RNF4 are required
for gH2AX. IF in U2OS cells treated with CPT or ETP revealed that PIAS4- and RNF4-KD reduced
the levels of gH2AX (Figure S6C-F), suggesting that PIAS4-RNF4-mediated proteasomal
degradation of TOP-DPCs enables activation of DDRs such as gH2AX.
DISCUSSION
Our study presents an evolutionally conserved SUMO-Ub-proteasome pathway of both TOP1 and
TOP2-DPCs for yeast and human cells. This pathway consists of a choreographed SUMO-Ubproteasome axis driven by human PIAS4 and yeast Siz1 as SUMO ligases and human RNF4 and
yeast Slx5/Slx8 as STUbLs. For these studies, we designed a novel assay (DUST) to detect Uband SUMO-TOP-DPCs.
We show that SUMO-2/3, SUMO-1 and ubiquitin are conjugated to TOP-DPCs
sequentially in human cells. SUMO-2/3 conjugation occurs first, with a maximum in less than 10
minutes, while SUMO-1 and Ub peak later (at 30 and 60 minutes, respectively). Our finding that
SUMO-2/3 downregulation prevents both SUMO-1 and Ub modifications of TOP-DPCs is
consistent with rate-limiting role for SUMO-2/3 modifications in TOP-mediated damage signaling
and repair. SUMO-1 KD resulted in increased SUMO-2/3-TOP-DPC species, denoting a role of
SUMO-1 in limiting SUMO-2/3 polymer elongation and exemplifying how mammalian cells
differentially employ two types of SUMO modifications. This division of labor is relevant to a recent
study showing that SUMO-2/3 but not SUMO-1 modification of human TOP2 enables TDP2 to
excise TOP2-DPCs without proteolyzing the bulk of the protein (Schellenberg et al., 2017). Our
data also show that the expeditious SUMOylation of TOP-DPCs is not coupled with replication or
transcription, and that excessive TOP1 binding to chromatin without DNA cleavage is sufficient to
evoke TOP1 SUMOylation. The extensive involvement and regulatory role of SUMOylation in
DDR extends beyond TOP-DPCs. Indeed, TOP-DPC SUMOylation is likely part of a more
extensive SUMO response surrounding DNA damage sites (Jackson and Durocher, 2013) and
impacting other DDR and repair proteins including TDP1 (Hudson et al., 2012), 53BP1, BRCA1
and Rad52 (Galanty et al., 2009; Jackson and Durocher, 2013; Morris et al., 2009).
Our study reveals PIAS4 as SUMO ligase for human TOP-DPCs in addition to its
established roles for DDR protein SUMOylation. We also show that in yeast TOP-DPC
SUMOylation is carried out by Siz1, the ortholog of PIAS4. Genetic suppression of PIAS4 in
human cells as well as biochemical assays demonstrate the activity of PIAS4 as E3 ligase toward
TOP1, TOP2aand TOP2b. Notably, our work also reveals that PIAS4 and TOPs interact even in
the absence of TOP inhibitors, implying that PIAS4 colocalizes with topoisomerases in chromatin
and carries out the prompt SUMOylation of TOP-DPCs once they become abortive. This
possibility is supported by our finding that the DNA binding domain (SAP) of PIAS4 is critical for
TOP-DPC SUMOylation. Thus, we propose that the DNA binding of PIAS4 next to the TOP-DPC
activates PIAS4 and TOP-DPC SUMOylation. Together, these experiments demonstrate the
importance of PIAS4 (and Siz1) in the early response to TOP-DPCs.
Our study connects SUMOylation of TOP-DPCs to their ubiquitylation through the STUbL
RNF4 in humans and Slx5-Slx8 in yeast. Suppressing SUMOylation genetically and
pharmacologically reduced TOP-DPC ubiquitylation. RNF4/Slx5-Slx8 are pivotal components in
this SUMO-Ub axis, as demonstrated by our finding that depletion of RNF4 in human cells and

Slx5-Slx8 in yeast reduce the levels of Ub-TOP-DPCs and elevate SUMO-TOP-DPCs. As a wellstudied STUbL, RNF4 is activated upon formation of poly-SUMOylated substrates through its SIM
domains and to contain a DNA binding motif within its RING domain (Groocock et al., 2014; RojasFernandez et al., 2014). Of note, our DUST experiments show that PIAS4-mediated SUMOylation
is activated independently of replication, transcription and DDRs, and that RNF4-catalyzed TOPDPC ubiquitylation only requires SUMOylation. These data signify a role of SUMOylation as the
first line of defense of toxic TOP-DPCs by priming them for RNF4-mediated proteasomal
degradation by. A potentially important determinant of PIAS4 and RNF4 activation could be their
binding to exposed DNA segments next to TOP-DPCs. RNF4 appears to be a key component of
the DDR impacting both histones and DNA repair proteins including BRCA1, MDC1, FANCD2,
and 53BP1 (Gibbs-Seymour et al., 2015; Groocock et al., 2014; Kumar et al., 2017; Poulsen et
al., 2013; Vyas et al., 2013), suggesting that the ubiquitylation of TOP-DPCs is part of a larger
DDR response at the DNA damage sites.
The importance of the proteasome in degrading TOP-DPCs has been established by
many studies prior to this one [reviewed in (Pommier et al., 2016)]. Yet, our study provides novel
molecular insights in this process by demonstrating the cellular binding of TOP1, TOP2a and
TOP2b to at least two components of the 26S proteasome: PSMD14 for deubiquitylation and
PSMB5 for proteolytic digestion. We also show that the RNF4-mediated Ub linkage to TOPs is
through lysine 48 chain, which is required for of the interaction between proteasome subunits and
TOP-DPCs. Further studies are warranted to establish whether the SUMO-Ub-proteasome
pathway described here extends to other enzymatic DPCs such as those generated by DNA
methyltransferases and chemically by formaldehyde or chemotherapeutic crosslinking agents
such platinum derivatives. (Borgermann et al., 2019; Larsen et al., 2019; Sparks et al., 2019).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Yeast Strains and Plasmids
BY4741 and YMM10 are two haploid strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which were used
as parental strains in this study. Individual BY4741 ORF KANMX4 deletion mutants (slx5∆,
slx8∆, siz1∆, siz2∆, mre11∆, tdp1∆) were purchased from Open Biosystems or Dharmacon. To
generate disruption of TDP1 in BY4741 slx5D and siz1D strains, plasmid containing TDP1
sequence was digested with restriction enzymes to create an internal deletion of the gene
followed by replacement with a LEU2 cassette. Disrupted alleles were PCR amplified, and the
PCR product was used in transformation of BY4741 slx5D and siz1D strains (Nitiss et al., 2006).
To generate BY4741 slx5Dsiz1D double mutant, BY4742 siz1D::KANMX4:: and BY4741
slx5D::LEU2:: were mated, and diploid cells were sporulated and microdissected. Mating type
was determined using H317 MATa and H318 MATα ura2 tester strains. In YMM10 strain, genes
encoding nine different types of transmembrane drug-efflux pump proteins are deleted. A study
has reported that YMM10 strain displays improved drug accumulation and enhanced sensitivity
to ETP(Tombline et al., 2017). For immunodetection of yeast TOP1, N-terminally HA-tagged
TOP1 cDNA was amplified by PCR using primers and inserted in NcoI/XhoI sites of pYX112
vector. Strains were transformed with pYX112 as an empty vector or pYX112 HA-TOP1 in
which TOP1 expression is driven from the promoter TPI1. For immunodetection of yeast TOP2,
strains were transformed with yCP50 as an empty vector or a yeast TOP2-3×HA overexpression
plasmid pDED1 TOP2 in which TOP2 expression is driven from the DED1 promoter. To
enhance accumulation of CPT and ETP in yeast cells, XhoI-excised construct of DNA binding
domain (DBD) of PDR1 gene fused in frame to transcription repressor gene CYC8 from
pBlueScript backbone was transformed to all BY4741 single mutant derivatives to repress Pdr1
regulated genes as described previously (Stepanov et al., 2008).
Site-Directed Mutagenesis in Yeast Vectors
SUMOylation-deficient yeast TOP1 allele, top1-K65, 91, 92R (Chen et al., 2007) was
constructed in pYX112 HA-TOP1 vector using oligonucleotides 5’AGATTTCCAAGAAAAAGACTAAGAAAATAAGGACCGAACCAGTGCAA-3′(K65R), 5′-G
GCGCGACATCAAAGCCTAAAAAAATCAGGAGAGAAGATGGTGATG-3′(K91,92R).
SUMOylation-deficient yeast TOP2 allele, top2-SNM (Bachant et al., 2002) was constructed in
pDED1 TOP2-3×HA vector using oligonucleotides 5’GCTAGAAAGGGCAAAAAAATTAGGGTCGAGGATAAGAATTTTG-3′(K1220R), 5′GCAAGGCGCCTACAAAGATTAGAAGAGAGAAAACGCCTTCTGTTTC-3′(K1246R, K1247R)
and 5′-CTTCTTCTATTTTCGACATAAgGAgAGAAGATAAAGATGAGGGCG-3′(K1277R,
K1278R).
Western Blotting in Yeast
After inhibitor treatments, yeast cells were pelleted then washed with alkaline lysis buffer (200
mM NaOH, 2 mM EDTA) (Mao et al., 2000b). Cells were then resuspended in 700 μl alkaline
lysis buffer and lysed by homogenization at 4 °C. After 4 cycles of homogenization (50 seconds
each cycle, 5 min rest in between), lysates were centrifuged and 400 μl supernatants were
retrieved, followed by neutralization by the addition of 80 μl of 1 M HCl, 600 mM Tris, pH 8.0.
Samples were treated with 54 μl of 10× micrococcal nuclease buffer (50 mM CaCl2, 500 mM
Tris pH=7.9) and 1 μl micrococcal nuclease (100 units/μl). The resulting mixtures were
incubated on ice for 1h for releasing TOPs from DNA by digestion. Protein concentration were
determined by using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). The lysates were mixed with 4× laemmli
buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, followed by IB with indicated antibodies.

Clonogenic Assay in Yeast
Drug sensitivity assay in yeast cells was carried out as described previously(Nitiss et al., 1992).
Briefly, cells were grown to mid-exponential phase in synthetic complete media lacking uracil
(SC-URA) then diluted to 2 × 106 cells/ml. After addition of inhibitors, cells were incubated,
diluted, and plated at various time points as indicated onto SC-URA plates. Plates were
incubated at 30 °C, and the numbers of colonies were counted. Results were expressed relative
to the number of viable colonies at the time of drug addition.
HA-Immunoprecipitation in Yeast.
Yeast lysates were prepared by the alkaline lysis procedure as described above. The lysates
were incubated with anti-HA antibody in yeast IP lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5,
50 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.2% Trinton X-100, 5% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 20 mM N-ethylmaleimide
and yeast protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma Aldrich, P8215) at 4 °C overnight. 50 μl Protein A/G
PLUS-agarose slurry was added and incubated with the lysates for anther 4 hrs. After
centrifugation, immunoprecipitates were washed with yeast IP lysis buffer 2 times then
resuspended in 2 × laemmli buffer for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with indicated antibodies.
ICE assay in Yeast
After inhibitor treatment, yeast cells were washed in lysis buffer containing 6 M guanidinium
thiocyanate (GTC), 1% sarkosyl, 4% Triton X 100, 10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.0), 20 mM EDTA,
yeast protease inhibitor cocktail, 20 mM N-ethylmaleimide and 1 mM DTT. Lysates were
prepared in the lysis buffer by homogenization using a bead beater. Lysates were incubated at
65°C for 15 min, followed by centrifugation to remove cell debris. Supernatants were diluted in
1% sarkosyl in TE buffer and centrifuged again. Supernatants were then loaded on 150% (w/v)
cesium chloride for ultracentrifugation for 18 hr at 42000 rpm in a NVT 65.2 rotor (Beckman
coulter) at 25°C. Nucleic acids pellets containing TOP-DPCs were retrieved in ddH2O and
digested with RNase A. Purified DNA samples were quantitated and 10 μg of each sample was
digested with micrococcal nuclease and subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis for
immunodetection of total TOP-DPCs, ubiquitylated TOP-DPCs and SUMOylated TOP-DPCs. 2
μg of each sample was subjected to slot-blot for immunoblotting with anti-dsDNA antibody to
confirm equal amounts of DNA load.
Spot Test in Yeast
For yeast growth on media containing drug, 3 μl of a serial dilution of growing cells was applied
to SC-URA plates containing the indicated concentrations of inhibitors. Plates were incubated at
30°C for 2 days and photographed.
Human Cell Culture
HEK293 cells, HCT116 colon cancer cells, MCF7 breast cancer cells and HeLa cells were in
cultured in DMEM medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum,
100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg streptomycin /ml streptomycin and 1x GlutaMax in tissue culture
dishes at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 – regulated (5%) incubator.
Generation of Gene Knock-out Cells Using CRISPR-Cas9
To stably knockout the genes encoding TOP2B, PIAS4 or RNF4, the CRISPR–Cas9 genomeediting method was used(Ran et al., 2013). To delete TOP2B in HeLa cells, two 25-bp (minus
the PAMs) guide RNA sequences 5’-CACCGGATTTGGCTGGTTCGTGTAG-3’ and 5’ACCGTAAATTTGGACAGATCTGGT-3’ targeting TOP2B exon 7 were designed using the
CHOP CHOP tool and cloned into the Cas9 expressing guide RNA vectors pX458 and pX459,
respectively. In brief, the Bbs1 cutting site containing guide RNA sequences were annealed and
then cloned into the guide RNA vector using T4 ligase (New England Biolabs). The plasmids

were transfected with Lipofectamine 3000 in HeLa cells. Transfected cells were enriched by
selection in 0.5 mg/ml puromycin containing media for 3 days prior to isolation of single clones
and screening for loss of TOP2β by Western blotting. To delete PIAS4 in HCT116 cells, two
guide RNA sequences 5’-CACCGCATGCACTCCACCTACGACC-3’ and 5’CACCGAGAACGGCAGCTTCACCAGG-3’ targeting PIAS4 exon 2 were designed and cloned
into pX458 and pX459, respectively. The plasmids were transfected in HCT116 cells, followed
by selection in media containing 1 mg/ml puromycin for 3 days prior to isolation of single clones
and screening for loss of PIAS4 by Western blotting. To delete RNF4 gene in MCF7 cells, two
guide RNA sequences 5’-CACCGAGGCAAAGAAAATCGAGACC-3’ and 5’CACCGCATACACTCTCGTCCACGGC-3’ targeting RNF4 exon 3 were designed and cloned
into pX458 and pX459, respectively. The RNF4 guide constructs were transfected into MCF7
cells, followed by puromycin selection and single clone isolation. Deletion of RNF4 gene was
confirmed by sanger sequencing and loss of RNF4 expression by Western blotting.

Western Blotting in Human Cells
CPT-induced TOP1 degradation and ETP-induced TOP2 degradation were monitored by
Western blotting of the alkaline lysates prepared from drug-treated HEK293 cells with slight
modifications(Ban et al., 2013). Following treatment, cells were washed with DMEM and
incubated at 37°C in a CO2 incubator for 30 min then lysed with 100 μl of an alkaline lysis buffer
(200 mM NaOH, 2 mM EDTA). Alkaline lysates were neutralized by the addition of 100 μl of 1 M
HEPEs buffer, pH 7.3, followed by mixing with 10 μl 100mM CaCl2, 1 μl 2M DTT and 2 μl 100 ×
protease inhibitor cocktail and 200 units of micrococcal nuclease. The resulting mixtures were
incubated on ice for 1 h. 70 μl of 4 × laemmli buffer was added to each sample. The lysates
were boiled for 10 min, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with various antibodies as
indicated. Other proteins were detected by lysing cells with RIPA buffer (150mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5% Sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT and protease
inhibitor cocktail).
In vivo of complex (ICE) assay in Human Cells
TOP-DPCs were isolated and detected using in vivo complex of enzyme (ICE) assay as
previously described(Anand et al., 2018). Briefly, cells were lysed in sarkosyl solution (1% w/v)
after treatment. Cell lysates were sheared through a 25g 5/8 needle (10 strokes) to reduce the
viscosity of DNA and layered onto CsCl solution (150% w/v), followed by centrifugation in NVT
65.2 rotor (Beckman coulter) at 42,000 RPM for 20 hours at 25 °C. The resulting pellet
containing nucleic acids and TOP-DPCs was obtained and dissolved in TE buffer. The samples
were quantitated and subjected to slot-blot for immunoblotting with various antibodies as
indicated. 2 μg of DNA is applied per sample. For mass spectrometric analysis, ICE samples
were treated with RNase A to eliminate RNA contamination. TOP-DPCs were quantified by
densitometric analysis using ImageJ.

Detection of Ubiquitylated and SUMOylated Topoisomerase DNA-Protein Crosslinks
(DUST) Assay in Human Cells
After topoisomerase inhibitor treatments, 1 × 106 human cells in 35 mm dish per sample were
washed with 1 × PBS and lysed with 600 μl DNAzol (Invitrogen), followed by precipitation with
300 μl 200 proof ethanol. The nucleic acids were collected, washed with 75% ethanol,
resuspended in 200 μl TE buffer then heated at 65°C for 15 minutes, followed by shearing with
sonication (40% output for 10 sec pulse and 10 sec rest for 4 times). The samples are
centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 5 min and the supernatant are collected and treated RNase A
(100 μg/ml) for 1 h, followed by addition of 1/10 volume of 3 M sodium acetate sodium acetate
and 2.5 volume of 200 proof ethanol. After 20 min full speed centrifugation, DNA pellet was
retrieved and resuspended in 100 μl TE buffer for spectrophotometric measurement to
quantitate DNA content. 10 μg of each sample was digested with 50 units micrococcal nuclease
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, 100 units/μl) in presence of 5 mM CaCl2, followed by SDS-PAGE
electrophoresis for immunodetection of total TOP-DPCs, SUMOylated TOP-DPCs as well as
ubiquitylated TOP-DPCs using specific antibodies. In addition, 2 μg of each sample was
subjected to slot-blot for immunoblotting with anti-dsDNA antibody (Abcam, ab27156) to confirm
equal DNA loading.
His-Pull Down Assay in Denaturing and Native conditions
Human cells are washed with 1 × PBS and incubated with 220 μl IP lysis buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl
pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.2% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 20
mM N-ethylmaleimide and protease inhibitor cocktail) on a shaker for 15 min at 4 °C, followed
by sonication and centrifugation. Supernatant was collected and treated with 1 μl benzonase
(250 units/μl) for 1h. An aliquot (20 μl) of the lysate of each treatment group was saved as input.
The rest of the lysates was divided in two groups: native pull-down and denaturing pull-down.
For native pull-down, lysates were resuspended in 900 μl IP lysis buffer containing 10 mM
imidazole and 100 μl equilibrated Ni-NTA-agarose and rotated overnight at 4°C. Ni-NTA resin
was spun down and washed with TI buffer two times (25 mM Tris HCL, 20 mM imidazole, pH
6.8), followed by resuspension in 2 × laemmli buffer for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with
various antibodies as indicated. For denaturing pull-down, lysates were resuspended in 900 μl
Buffer A (6M guanidine-HCL, 0.1 M Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 10 mM imidazole pH8.0) containing
100 μl equilibrated Ni-NTA-agarose and rotated overnight at 4°C. Ni-NTA resin was spun down

2 × laemmli buffer for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with various antibodies as indicated.
Mass Spectrometry
Samples were either separated by SDS-PAGE for in-gel trypsin digestion as
described(Shevchenko et al., 2006) or in-solution digested with trypsin following the filter-aided
sample preparation (FASP) protocol as previously described(Wisniewski et al., 2009). Dried
peptides were solubilized in 2% acetonitrile, 0.5% acetic acid, 97.5% water for mass
spectrometry analysis. They were trapped on a trapping column and separated on a 75 µm x 15
cm, 2 µm Acclaim PepMap reverse phase column (Thermo Scientific) using an UltiMate 3000
RSLCnano HPLC (Thermo Scientific). Peptides were separated at a flow rate of 300 nL/min
followed by online analysis by tandem mass spectrometry using a Thermo Orbitrap Fusion
mass spectrometer. Peptides were eluted into the mass spectrometer using a linear gradient
from 96% mobile phase A (0.1% formic acid in water) to 55% mobile phase B (0.1% formic acid
in acetonitrile). Parent full-scan mass spectra were collected in the Orbitrap mass analyzer set
to acquire data at 120,000 FWHM resolution; ions were then isolated in the quadrupole mass
filter, fragmented within the HCD cell (HCD normalized energy 32%, stepped ± 3%), and the
product ions analyzed in the ion trap. Proteome Discoverer 2.2 (Thermo) was used to search
the data against human proteins from the UniProt database using SequestHT. The search was
limited to tryptic peptides, with maximally two missed cleavages allowed. Cysteine
carbamidomethylation was set as a fixed modification, and methionine oxidation set as a
variable modification. Diglycine modification to lysine was set as a variable modification for
experiments to identify sites of enzymatic PTMs. The precursor mass tolerance was 10 ppm,
and the fragment mass tolerance was 0.6 Da. The Percolator node was used to score and rank
peptide matches using a 1% false discovery rate.
