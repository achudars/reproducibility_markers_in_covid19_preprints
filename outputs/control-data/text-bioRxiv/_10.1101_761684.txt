ABSTRACT

2

Regulatory small RNAs (sRNAs) represent a major class of regulatory molecules that

3

play large-scale and essential roles in many cellular processes across all domains of

4

life. Microbial sRNAs have been primarily investigated in a few model organisms and

5

little is known about the dynamics of sRNA synthesis in natural environments, and the

6

roles of these short transcripts at the community level. Analyzing the metatranscriptome

7

of a model extremophilic community inhabiting halite nodules (salt rocks) from the

8

Atacama Desert with SnapT – a new sRNA annotation pipeline – we discovered

9

hundreds of intergenic (itsRNAs) and antisense (asRNAs) sRNAs. The halite sRNAs

10

were taxonomically diverse with the majority expressed by members of the

11

Halobacteria. We found asRNAs with expression levels negatively correlated with that

12

of their putative overlapping target, suggesting a potential gene regulatory mechanism.

13

A number of itsRNAs were conserved and significantly differentially expressed (FDR

14

<5%) between 2 sampling time points allowing for stable secondary structure modeling

15

and target prediction. This work demonstrates that metatranscriptomic field experiments

16

link environmental variation with changes in RNA pools and have the potential to

17

provide new insights into environmental sensing and responses in natural microbial

18

communities through non-coding RNA mediated gene regulation.

INTRODUCTION

20

Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are untranslated short transcripts that are found in the

21

three domains of life where they play essential roles in many cellular processes

22

(Gelsinger and DiRuggiero 2018b, Cech and Steitz 2014). In prokaryotes, a subset of

23

these ncRNAs, thereby called small RNAs (sRNAs), are specifically involved in gene

24

regulation through RNA-RNA mediated interactions, modulating core metabolic

25

functions and stress related responses (Gottesman and Storz 2011). These sRNAs

26

range from 50 to 500 nucleotides in size and can be of two types: trans-encoded

27

sRNAs, also called intergenic sRNAs (itsRNAs), which bind their mRNA targets via

28

imperfect base-pairing and can target multiple genes, including key transcription factors

29

and regulators (Wagner and Romby 2015). itsRNAs can activate or inhibit translation

30

initiation by interacting with the ribosome binding site (RBS) and/or modulating mRNA

31

stability (Wagner and Romby 2015). In contrast, cis-encoded antisense RNAs (asRNAs)

32

are transcribed on the DNA strand opposite their target gene and thus can act via

33

extensive base pairing; they have been found to repress transposons and toxic protein

34

synthesis (Wagner and Romby 2015).

35

The functional roles of microbial sRNAs have been extensively studied in a few model

36

organisms and very little is known about the dynamics of sRNA synthesis in natural

37

environments and the roles of these short transcripts at the community level (Carrier,

38

Lalaouna, and Massé 2018, Gelsinger and DiRuggiero 2018b). To our knowledge, only

39

two studies have reported the discovery of sRNAs in natural microbial communities

40

(Shi, Tyson, and DeLong 2009, Bao et al. 2015). This paucity of knowledge suggests

41

that an abundance of sRNAs remain to be discovered, in particular in extreme

42

environments where they likely play essential roles in stress response (Clouet-d'Orval et

43

al. 2018), inter-species communication, and/or cross-species RNA interference

44

(Toyofuku, Nomura, and Eberl 2019, Cai et al. 2018, Tsatsaronis et al. 2018).

45

In hyper-arid deserts, microbial communities find refuge inside rocks as a survival

46

strategy against the extreme conditions of their environment (Pointing and Belnap

47

2012). Such community inhabits halite (salt) nodules in Salars of the Atacama Desert,

48

Chile, which is one of the oldest and driest deserts on Earth (Crits-Christoph et al. 2016,

49

Finstad et al. 2017). The halite endolithic (within rock) community harbors mostly

50

members of the Archaea (Halobacteria), unique Cyanobacteria, diverse heterotrophic

51

bacteria, and a novel type of algae (Crits-Christoph et al. 2016, Finstad et al. 2017). The

52

main source of liquid water for this community is from salt deliquescence (Davila et al.

53

2008) and it is sustained by CO2 fixed via photosynthesis (Crits-Christoph et al. 2016,

54

Davila et al. 2015). While previous studies have demonstrated the role of sRNAs in the

55

stress response of one of the members of this community, the halophilic archaeon

56

Haloferax volcanii (Gelsinger and DiRuggiero 2018a, Kliemt, Jaschinski, and Soppa

57

2019), there is no information on any of the other members.

metatranscriptomics to investigate the role of sRNAs in the adaptive response of

60

microorganisms inhabiting halite nodules. We developed an analytical pipeline, SnapT,

61

built on our previous work on sRNAs with model organisms (Gelsinger and DiRuggiero

62

2018a), to enable the discovery of sRNAs at the community level. We found hundreds

63

of sRNAs (both itsRNAs and asRNAs) in the halite community, including conserved

64

sRNAs, validating our experimental approach. A number of itsRNAs were significantly

65

differentially regulated between 2 sampling time points and, for a subset of these, we

66

were able to perform structure and target prediction, deciphering their potential

67

regulatory roles. Coupling metagenomics and metatranscriptomics with SnapT allows

68

for the potential to uncover the complex regulatory networks that govern the state of a

microbial community.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

72

Sample and weather data collection and nucleic acid extraction

73

Halite nodules were harvested in Salar Grande, an ancient evaporated lake in the

74

Northern part of the Atacama Desert (Robinson et al. 2015) in February 2016 and 2017,

75

3 and 15 months after a major rain event (Uritskiy et al. 2019). All nodules were

76

harvested within a 50m2 area as previously described (Robinson et al. 2015). The

77

colonization zone of each nodule was grounded into a powder, pooling from 1-3 nodules

78

until sufficient material was collected, and stored in the dark in dry conditions until DNA

79

extraction in the lab. Samples used for RNA were stored in RNAlater at 4°C until RNA

80

extraction in the lab. Genomic DNA was extracted as previously described (Robinson et

al. 2015, Crits-Christoph et al. 2016) with the DNAeasy PowerSoil DNA extraction kit

82

(QIAGEN). Total RNA was extracted from the fixed samples by first isolating the cells

83

through gradual dissolving of the salt particles as previously described (Robinson et al.

84

2015, Crits-Christoph et al. 2016) and lysing them through mechanical bead beating

85

with the RNAeasy PowerSoil RNA extraction kit (QIAGEN). Total RNA was then

86

extracted from the lysate with a Quick-RNA miniprep kit (Zymo Research). RT-PCR was

87

used to validate the absence of contaminating DNA in the total RNA used for RNA-seq

88

libraries (Fig. S11).

89
90

Library preparation

91

Whole genome sequencing libraries were prepared using the KAPA HyperPlus kit

92

(Roche) as previously described (Uritskiy et al. 2019) and sequenced with paired 150bp

93

reads on the HiSeq 2000 platform at the Johns Hopkins Genetic Resources Core

94

Facility (GRCF). Total RNA-seq libraries were prepared with the SMARTer Stranded

95

RNA-seq kit (Takara and Bell), using 25ng of RNA input and 12 cycles for library

96

amplification. We sequenced 22 libraries from replicate samples from 2016 and 24

97

libraries from replicate samples from 2017.

WMG sequence processing

The de-multiplexed WMG sequencing reads were processed with the complete

112

criteria were as follows: intergenic transcripts were at least 30 nt away from any gene or

113

ORF on both strands; antisense transcripts were 30 nt away from any gene on their

114

strand, but overlapped with a gene on the opposite strand by at least 10 nt; small

115

peptides (<100 nt) were not counted as genes if they were encoded in a transcript that

116

was more than 3 times their length; non-coding transcripts could not contain any

117

reading frame greater than 1/3 of their lengths; predicted non-coding transcripts near

118

contig edges were discarded and the minimum distance to the edge of a contig was

119

dynamically computed such that the tips of contigs were not statistically enriched in

120

annotated ncRNAs; small ncRNAs were between 50 nt and 500 nt in length; sRNA

121

transcripts could not have significant homology with any protein in the NCBI_nr

122

database (query cover>30%, Bitscore>50, evalue<0.0001, and identity>30%) and with

123

any tRNA, RNase P, or signal recognition particle (SRP) model in the Rfam non-coding

124

RNA database.

125
126

Taxonomic assignment and distribution of sRNAs

127

The taxonomic origin of each annotated sRNA was taken to be as that of the contig on

128

which it lay. The taxonomy of each contig was estimated by taking the weighted

129

average of the taxonomic assignment of the genes encoded on it, as determined

130

through the JGI IMG functional and taxonomic annotation service.

131
132

Metatranscriptomic Correlation and Differential Expression Analysis

133

We used a read count-based differential expression analysis to identify differentially

134

expressed sRNA and mRNA transcripts. The program featureCounts (Liao, Smyth, and

135

Shi 2014) was used to rapidly count reads that map to the assembled RNA transcripts

136

(described above) as previously described (Gelsinger and DiRuggiero 2018a). In order

137

to account for organism abundance changes (as opposed to true transcript changes),

138

we normalized the transcript read counts to the total read counts from the contig on

139

which the transcript lies on. The read counts were then used in the R differential

140

expression software package DESeq2 (Love, Huber, and Anders 2014) to calculate

141

differential expression by determining the difference in read counts between 2016

142

normalized read counts from 2017 normalized read counts. The differentially expressed

143

RNAs were filtered based on the statistical parameter of False Discovery Rate (FDR)

144

and those that were equal to or under a FDR of 5% were classified as true differentially

145

expressed transcripts. We carried out differential expression analysis using a pairwise

146

Wald test to find any possible differences between years (Love, Huber, and Anders

147

2014). In parallel, normalized expression values were calculated using stringtie in

148

transcripts per million (TPM). TPM of transcripts were normalized in the same way as

149

read counts, except using contig TPM. TPM of transcripts was used for ranking of

150

expression within samples as opposed to differential expression analysis.

151
152

Regulatory element motif identification of sRNAs, structure and target prediction

153

50 nucleotides upstream from the sRNA transcript start coordinates were searched for

154

transcription motifs (BRE and TATA-box for archaea and -35 and -10 consensus

155

sequences for bacteria) using both multiple sequence alignments and visualization with

156

WebLogo and motif searching with MEME (Gelsinger and DiRuggiero 2018a).

157

Conserved sRNAs were identified using blastn against the NCBI nt database.

158

Secondary structures of conserved sRNAs were predicted using sRNAs that had an e-

159

value maximum of 1E-3, a sequence similarity of 70% or more, and 50% or more

160

coverage with a NCBI nt database blastn hit; a minimum of 14 alignments were used in

161

the program LocARNA using global alignment settings (Will et al. 2012). Lastly, putative

162

targets were predicted for itsRNAs by searching for optimal sRNA-mRNA hybridization

163

using the IntaRNA program with the no seed parameter (Mann, Wright, and Backofen

164

2017) and the reference genes for each respective MAG. Targets were ranked by

165

lowest p-value. Expression levels for putative targets of antisense sRNAs were obtained

166

from co-expression analysis of transcripts (Gelsinger and DiRuggiero 2018a). The

167

sRNA and putative target mRNA TPM expression values were tracked across the

168

replicates, and the Pearson correlation was computed.

169
170

Enrichment cultures

171

Three types of culture medium were inoculated in triplicate with ~2 g of grounded halite

172

colonization zones and incubated at 42°C with shaking at 220 rpm (Amerex Gyromax

173

737) for 1 to 2 weeks. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and nucleic acids

extracted as described above. Media were: GN101 medium (Kish et al. 2009)

175

containing 250 g of salt per L and 10 g of peptone as carbon source; Hv-YPC medium

176

(Dyall-Smith 2009) containing 250 g of salt per L and 8.5 g of yeast extract, 1.7 g of

177

peptone, and 1.7 of casamino acids as carbon sources; and IO containing 250 g of salt

178

and the same carbon sources as the Hv-YPC medium. The taxonomic distribution of the

179

cultures was obtained with 16S rRNA gene sequencing as previously described

180

(Uritskiy et al. 2019).

sRNA validation

Total RNA extracted from environmental samples and enrichment cultures was

184

converted into cDNA using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System

185

(ThermoFisher). The cDNA was then amplified using primers designed for sRNAs

186

identified in the halite community (Table S1), as previously described (Meslier et al.

187

2018). Amplicons were sequenced using Sanger sequencing (GENEWIZ, South

Plainfield, NJ).

205

collected in the field in 2016 and 2017

(21 and 24 replicates for 2016 and 2017,

206

respectively; Fig. S1). Using SnapT, we aligned reads from stranded RNA-seq libraries

207

to our reference co-assembled metagenome from a previous study (Uritskiy et al. 2019)

208

and assembled the reads into transcripts (Fig S2). The transcripts were then intersected

209

with the metagenome annotation as well as open reading frames to select for either

210

novel transcripts on the opposite strand of coding transcripts (asRNAs) or for novel

211

transcripts that fell into intergenic regions (itsRNAs). Putative ncRNA transcripts were

212

then further enriched (Fig. S2) using a threshold at 5x and 10x assembly coverage in

213

order to identify intergenic and antisense ncRNAs, respectively. (Fig. S3; Table 1). The

214

size of these ncRNAs was then filtered from 50 to 500 nucleotides to produce a final set

215

of non-coding sRNAs. The size distribution of these sRNAs was primarily between 50

216

and 200 nt for itsRNAs and above 200 nt for asRNAs. (Fig. S4).

217

The halite ncRNAs were taxonomically assigned to diverse members of the community;

218

their distribution between Archaea (54%) and Bacteria (46%) (Table 1) was similar to

219

that of the total metatranscriptomic reads for the community (Fig. 1B and C). In

220

contrast, the taxonomic profile of the metagenome showed a larger contribution of

221

bacterial reads and in particular of reads assigned to Cyanobacteria and Bacteroidetes

222

(Fig. 1A). Because of the use of strand specific RNA-seq libraries, we could confidently

223

identify both intergenic (it)sRNA, located between coding regions, and antisense

224

(a)sRNA, overlapping with their putative target (Table 1). We found 3 times more

225

itsRNAs in the Archaea than in the Bacteria, whereas asRNAs were more abundant in

226

the Bacteria and more often associated with members of the Cyanobacteria (38%) and

227

Bacteriodetes (15%) (Table 1; Fig. 1D and E). We also found 79 ncRNAs, that belong

228

to 6 known families of RNAs present in the Rfam database (Fig. S5; data S2) (Kalvari

229

et al. 2017), validating our experimental and computational approach. This database is

230

a collection of RNA families, each represented by multiple sequence alignments,

231

consensus secondary structures, and covariance models. Of the Rfam-conserved

232

ncRNAs, 70% were assigned to archaea and included RNaseP RNAs, signal

233

recognition particle RNAs (SRP RNAs), and tRNAs. Of the Rfam-conserved bacterial

234

ncRNAs, most were from SRP RNAs and tRNA conserved families. In addition, a

235

cobalamin riboswitch and the regulatory sRNA, CyVA-1, were detected in low

236

abundance in the halite Cyanobacteria. We also found 3 ncRNAs (4%) from Eukarya, a

237

tRNA, a U4 spliceosomal RNA, and a RNase for mitochondrial RNA processing (MRP).

238

Using blastn analysis (max e-value of 1E-3, sequence similarity of 70% or more,

239

coverage of 50% or more), we discovered another 155 ncRNAs that were conserved in

240

the NCBI nt datasbase, with 60% from archaea and 40% from bacteria (Table 1). The

241

majority were asRNAs (109), with only 44 itsRNAs. The conserved asRNAs most highly

242

expressed (standardized tpm> 100) were all SPR RNAs in haloarchaea that were not

243

found in the Rfam database. Of the conserved itsRNAs, we identified 3 tRNAs, 13 SRP

244

RNAs, and 22 ncRNAs that were found in the genome of multiple species, all

245

Halobacteria, but with no function assigned. The most highly expressed and conserved

246

itsRNAs (standardized tpm> 100; 13 ncRNAs) were SRP RNAs not included in the

247

Rfam database.

248

Another validation of our findings was the presence of canonical promoter elements

249

upstream of archaeal itsRNAs, suggesting that they were indeed bona fide transcripts

250

that could recruit basal transcription factors (Fig. S6). We did not find significant

251

promoter elements upstream of the bacterial itsRNAs, which might reflect the diversity

252

of promoter elements across the various bacterial taxa we identified in the halite

253

community. In contrast, no promoter elements were identified in the upstream regions of

254

asRNA from both domains of life.

255

When looking at the expression levels of all itsRNAs normalized to contig abundances,

256

we found that they were similar for both the 2016 and 2017 samples and slightly higher

257

than that of the asRNAs, whereas the expression profile of the asRNAs was more

258

variable across samples for both years (Fig. S7). Remarkably, the expression levels of

259

itsRNAs and asRNAs for both years was 2-fold higher than that of protein encoding

260

genes. Whereas there is an inherent bias in our approach to identify sRNAs at the

261

community level (coverage threshold in SnapT) compared to protein encoding genes,

262

this finding strongly indicates potential functional relevance for a number of these

263

sRNAs.

264

We experimentally validated a number of sRNAs using RT-PCR with environmental and

265

enrichment cultures (Table S1). Enrichments were performed with several media

266

containing high (25%) and relatively low (18%) salt, and various combinations of carbon

267

sources. Amplicon sequencing of the enrichments revealed that high salt and diverse

268

carbon sources resulted in higher diversity of taxa, although haloarchaea dominated in

269

all enrichments (Fig. S8). All validated sRNAs belong to haloarchaea with the exception

270

of one from Cyanobacteria. Sequences of the PCR products confirmed that they were

271

sRNAs and validated our computational approach.

272

Relationship with target genes and putative function of community asRNAs

273

Using our strand-specific RNA-seq data, we were able to identify the overlap position of

274

asRNAs to their antisense transcripts. We found that, in both Archaea and Bacteria, the

275

majority of asRNAs start within the span of their cognate gene and end near the 5’ end

276

of its mRNA. In both domains there is also an enrichment for asRNA-mRNA overlaps

277

near the 5’ end of the mRNA. A similar trend has previously been reported in two

278

species of archaea (Gelsinger and DiRuggiero 2018a, de Almeida et al. 2019).

279

We compared the expression level of asRNAs with that of their putative target genes

280

and found that highly expressed asRNAs were associated with lowly express genes

281

(Fig. 2A). Of gene pairs with asRNA expression >100 tpm and gene expression <0.1

282

tpm, most where from haloarchaea (77%), with 12% of Cyanobacteria, and 11% of

283

other bacteria (Bacteriodetes and Acinetobacter) (data S3). Gene functions were

284

enriched for transport (16%) and cell membrane/wall metabolism (5%), while most were

285

hypothetical proteins (44%). Of the genes potentially negatively regulated by their

286

cognate asRNAs, we found an archaeal regulator of the IclR family and potassium

287

uptake protein TrkA. Only 2 asRNAs with high expression levels (>100 standardized

288

tpm) were associated with genes with relatively high expression levels (>1 standardized

289

tpm), while still being negatively correlated (Fig. 2A). The corresponding genes encoded

290

for an iron complex outermembrane receptor protein from Salinibacter and a ABC-type

291

sodium efflux pump permease subunit from a Halobacteria. When applying a stringent

292

cut-off, we found 9 statistically significant and negatively correlated asRNA:gene pairs

293

(Fig. 2B). Four were from Bacteroidetes, 4 from Halobacteria, and 1 from an

294

unidentified bacterium. At the functional level, transport systems, and in particular iron

295

transport systems, were particularly enriched (data S3). In contrast, we did not find any

296

significant positive regulation between asRNAs and their cognate genes. When

297

adjusted for the carrying organism’s abundance, expressed as the average RNA read

298

coverage of the contigs, we found that overall itsRNAs were more highly expressed

299

than asRNAs (Fig. 2C and 2D). Highly expressed sRNAs, for both types, were mostly

300

carried by haloarchaea.

301

Differential expression of itsRNAs at the community level and target prediction

302

Analysis of itsRNAs expression levels showed a clear separation between the 2016 and

303

2017 samples (Fig. 3a). We carried out a differential expression analysis and found that

304

109 (18%) of the regulatory itsRNAs were significantly differentially expressed (FDR

305

<5%) between samples collected in 2016 and 2017 (Fig. 3 and data S4), 3 and 15

306

months after a major rain event in the desert (Uritskiy et al. 2019). Of these, 72% were

307

annotated as archaea and 28 % as bacteria and 16 were conserved in multiple

308

genomes (14 from Halobacteria and 2 from Cyanobacteria). Conservation of

309

differentially expressed itsRNAs allowed for structure modeling and, when high quality

310

MAGs (>70% completion and <5% contamination) were available from the

311

metagenome, target prediction (Fig. 4 and Fig. S10). A number of non-differentially

312

expressed itsRNAs were also conserved, providing additional opportunity for structure

313

prediction; these included itsRNAs from Halococcus (STRG. 48671.1; 69 nt), Halobellus

314

limi (STRG136887.1; 209 nt), and from a member of the Nanohaloarchaea

315

(STRG.4577.1; 266 nt) (Fig. S10A).

316

All predicted structures displayed loop and stems regions that had high sequence

317

conservation (light purple regions on sequence–structure-based alignment reliability

318

[STAR] profile plots) and high structure conservation (dark purple), and line plots

319

representing the reliability of the predictions as calculated by LocaRNA (Fig. 4 and Fig.

320

S10B). Density plots combined with dumbbell plots were used for visualizing predicted

321

interactions between itsRNAs and their putative targets, using IntaRNA data from the

322

top 100 most reliable interaction predictions with the lowest free energy of hybridization

323

(Mann, Wright, and Backofen 2017) (Fig. 4). High confidence assignments were

324

obtained for 4 differentially expressed itsRNAs from Cyanobacteria, Halapricum salinun,

325

and a member of the Halobacteria (data S5) More than one interaction peak were

326

derived from density plots; peak 1 (green) corresponded to the highest interaction

327

density, which mapped to loop regions in the itsRNA secondary structure with high

328

sequence and structure conservation, respectively, and was thus a confident

329

assignment as an interaction region, whereas Peak 2 (yellow) was a less confident

330

assignment structurally despite high interaction density (Fig. 4 and Fig. S10B).

331

Using this information, we identified the most probable targets for Cyanobacteria

332

STRG.5354.4 candidate itsRNA (229 nt). This itsRNA was conserved as a 6S

333

regulatory RNA in the rfam database, which in bacteria is found to inhibit transcription

334

by binding directly to the housekeeping holoenzyme form of RNA polymerase

335

(Wassarman 2018). Of the top 50 most probable targets for STRG.5354.4, which were

336

those with the lowest free energy of hybridization between itsRNA and targets, were

337

cation:H+ antiporters [shown to be involved in osmoregulation (Krulwich, Hicks, and Ito

338

2009)], a PleD family two-component response regulator, the photosystem I PsaB

339

protein, chemotaxis transducers, and proteins involved in energy metabolism. Most

340

probable targets for differentially expressed itsRNA, STRG. 86294.1 (281 nt) from

341

Halapricum salinum included various transporters and putative membrane and cell wall

342

associated proteins; notably an ammonium transporter (Amt family), an alkanesulfonate

343

monooxygenase SsuD from a gene cluster expressed under sulfate or cysteine

344

starvation (Eichhorn, van der Ploeg, and Leisinger 1999), and several proteins involved

345

in cofactors and vitamin metabolism. Predicted targets with the lowest free energy of

346

hybridization for STRG.49508.3 candidate itsRNA (99 nt) from Halobacteria were

347

elongation factor 1-alpha, which promotes the GTP-dependent binding of aminoacyl-

348

tRNA to the A-site of ribosomes during protein biosynthesis, several ribosomal proteins,

349

and a number of hypothetical proteins. Target prediction for Cyanobacteria

350

STRG.5356.1 candidate itsRNA (242 nt) included molecular chaperones (DnaK and

351

DnaJ classes), a cell division protease FtsH, and a number of uncharacterized proteins.

DISCUSSION

354

The roles of regulatory sRNAs have been extensively studied in bacterial, and to a

355

lesser extent, in archaeal model systems (Carrier, Lalaouna, and Massé 2018,

356

Gelsinger and DiRuggiero 2018b) but, to date, only two studies have reported the

357

discovery of sRNAs in microbial communities. In one study, Shi et al. (Shi, Tyson, and

12

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/761684; this version posted September 8, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

358

DeLong 2009) used metatranscriptomic data to identify unique microbial sRNAs in the

359

ocean’s water column while the study by Bao et al. (Bao et al. 2015) revealed extensive

360

antisense transcription in the human gut microbiota, also using metatranscriptomic

361

datasets. Efforts have also been made to mine publically available databases for sRNA

362

discovery (Weinberg et al. 2017) but this was still addressing the role of sRNAs in single

363

microorganisms.

364

One major difficulty in obtaining metatranscriptomic data from natural microbial

365

communities, in particular from extreme environments, is the low amount of biomass

366

that can be collected, resulting in low RNA yields (Uritskiy and DiRuggiero 2019). This,

367

in turn, prevents attempts at ribo-depletion, resulting in a decreased number of non-

368

ribosomal RNA reads available for analysis. Nevertheless, using SnapT, a flexible

369

pipeline to process metagenomics and metatranscriptomic data, we report the discovery

370

of hundreds of diverse sRNAs from an extremophilic community inhabiting halite

371

nodules in the Atacama Desert. In the process, we applied extensive quality control with

372

coverage thresholding, correction for contig edge mis-annotation, and the removal of

373

potential non-ncRNAs through sequence and homology searches. While this approach

374

might potentially result in false negatives, and may bias our findings toward the most

375

highly expressed sRNAs in the community, it also insured the robustness of our sRNA

376

predictions by minimizing the number false positives. The identification of ncRNAs in the

377

halite community that belong to the Rfam database (Kalvari et al. 2017), together with

378

experimental validation of a number of sRNAs with environmental and enrichment

379

cultures, substantiated our analytical approach. Additionally, expression levels of

380

sRNAs 2-fold higher than that of protein encoding genes, strongly indicates potential

381

functional relevance for a number of these sRNAs.

382

The taxonomic composition of the halite sRNAs matched that of the community’s

383

metatranscriptomic profile, reflecting the contribution of the most active members,

384

including Cyanobacteria, Bacteriodetes, and a number of Halobacteria. We found

385

significantly more itsRNAs in the archaea than in the bacteria and the trend was reverse

386

for the asRNAs. This novel finding is representative of published work in model

387

organisms where a wide range of sRNAs has been found so far in prokaryotes, from

13

388

less than a dozen to more than a thousand per genome (Carrier, Lalaouna, and Massé

389

2018, Gelsinger and DiRuggiero 2018b).

390

Antisense sRNAs overlap their putative targets providing insights into their functional

391

role (Wagner and Romby 2015). In the halite community, we found that asRNAs

392

expression levels were negatively correlated with that of their putative targets, with

393

highly expressed asRNAs overlapping lowly expressed protein encoding genes. A

394

similar trends was reported in the haloarchaeon Haloferax volcanii, when investigating

395

oxidative stress responsive sRNAs, and most of the putative targets were transposase

396

genes (Gelsinger and DiRuggiero 2018a). Putative target gene functions in our study

397

were mostly from haloarchaea and enriched for transport systems, cell membrane and

398

cell wall metabolism, with a large number of hypotheticals. Of particular interest, was an

399

archaeal IcIR transcription regulator; these regulators are known to be involved in

400

diverse physiological functions, including multidrug resistance, degradation of

401

aromatics, and secondary metabolites production (Molina-Henares et al. 2006) and are

402

distributed in a wide range of prokaryotes, including Archaea (Perez-Rueda et al. 2018).

403

Also of interest, was a Trk potassium uptake system, also found in both bacteria and

404

archaea and essential for the maintenance of high intracellular potassium in salt-in

405

strategists (Oren 2013). In contrast, we did not find any significant positive regulation

406

between asRNAs and their cognate genes, which might be due to the inherent quality of

407

our data set, i.e. no ribo-depletion and heterogeneity across replicates (Uritskiy and

408

DiRuggiero 2019). Alternatively, it might also reflect promiscuous transcription

409

processes as argued when considering the functionality of asRNAs (Lloréns-Rico et al.

410

2016). Other arguments in favor of spurious transcription was the size distribution for

411

asRNAs found in the halite community, which was significantly larger than that of

412

itsRNAs, low expression level when adjusted for organism abundance when compared

413

to itsRNAs, and the absence of canonical regulatory elements in the upstream regions

414

of asRNAs. However, we found also putative target functions that reflected the

415

environmental challenges faced by members of this extremophile community, such as

416

osmoregulation and nutrient uptake, indicating that these asRNAs might indeed regulate

417

fundamental biological functions at the community level.

418

We previously showed that the halite community dramatically shifted its taxonomic and

419

functional composition after a major rain event in 2015, and while it recovered at the

420

functional level in 2017, 15 months after the rain, members of the communities were

421

permanently replaced (Uritskiy et al. 2019). Here we found that 18% of the halite

422

community itsRNAs were significantly differentially expressed (FDR <5%) between

423

samples collected in 2016 and 2017 (3 and 15 months after the rain, respectively),

424

potentially indicating a transcriptional response to changes in environmental conditions.

425

Intergenic sRNAs are of particular interest because they can target multiple genes,

426

including key transcription factors and regulators (Gottesman and Storz 2011). As a

427

consequence, a single sRNA can modulate the expression of large regulons and thus

428

have a significant effect on metabolic processes (Carrier, Lalaouna, and Massé 2018).

429

However, they do not overlap their target genes or bind their targets mRNAs with

430

perfect complementary, which make finding targets for these sRNAs very challenging

431

without genetic tools (Gelsinger and DiRuggiero 2018b).

432

To solve this problem at the community level, we focused on itsRNAs that were

433

conserved and for which we could perform structural prediction. The intersection of this

434

small subset of sRNAs with high quality MAGs that could be used as reference

435

genomes, yielded confident target predictions for 4 differentially expressed itsRNAs,

436

giving insights into metabolic functions potentially regulated by sRNAs at the community

437

level. These included transporters, particularly related to osmotic stress, nutrient uptake

438

and starvation, and pathways for chemotaxis and energy production and conversion.

439

These pathways reflect the environmental challenges members of the halite

440

communities are subjected to, including osmotic adjustments to climate perturbation

441

(Uritskiy et al. 2019) and competition for nutrients in a near-close system with primary

442

production as the major source of organic carbon (Crits-Christoph et al. 2016). Using

443

the genomic context of sRNAs from the ocean’s water column microbial communities,

444

Shi et al. (Shi, Tyson, and DeLong 2009) reported similar metabolic functions,

445

underlying specific regulatory needs for natural communities. In contrast, genes with

446

antisense transcription to asRNAs identified in the human gut microbiome were mostly

447

transposase genes with a small component of bacterial house-keeping genes (Bao et

15

448

al. 2015). It important to note that no computational target prediction, using sRNA

449

conserved predicted structure, was reported in either study.

450

Regulation of transcription by 6S sRNA has been shown to increase competitiveness

451

and long-term survival in bacteria (Wassarman 2018), suggesting an important role for

452

Cyanobacteria candidate sRNA STRG.5354.4, identified as a 6S sRNA. Because of

453

high RNA-seq coverage of the Cyanobacteria MAGs, we could show that 40% of the top

454

50 targets for sRNA STRG.5354.4 were differentially regulated and more highly

455

expressed in 2016, suggesting positive regulation by this sRNAs onto its putative

456

targets. Transcriptional factors and regulators were also found as putative targets of

457

differentially regulated itsRNAs in the halite community, underlying the capacity of

458

microbial sRNAs to modulate the expression of large regulons (Gottesman and Storz

459

2011, Gelsinger and DiRuggiero 2018b, Nitzan, Rehani, and Margalit 2017). Finally, a

460

candidate itsRNAs from the Halobacteria had a number of predicted targets associated

461

with ribosomal proteins and proteins involved in translation processes. This finding,

462

together with a recent study in H. volcanii (Wyss et al. 2018), support the idea of sRNA

463

modulation of protein biosynthesis in the Archaea. A potential framework for

464

mechanisms for sRNA regulation of translation might be provided by a report, in the

465

haloarchaeon Halobacterium salinarum, of modular translation subsystems that might

466

selectively translate a subset of the transcriptome under specific growth conditions

467

(Raman et al. 2018).

468

Conclusion

469

In this study, we characterized the taxonomic and functional landscape of sRNAs

470

across two domains of life in an extremophilic microbial community, demonstrating that

asRNAs and itsRNAs can be reliably identified from natural environmental communities.

from any community. We demonstrated that we could perform target prediction and

476

correlate expression levels between itsRNAs and predicted target mRNAs, paving the
