Abstract
Background: Functional annotation of livestock genomes is a critical step to
decipher the genotype-to-phenotype relationship underlying complex traits.
As part of the Functional Annotation of Animal Genomes (FAANG) action, the
FR-AgENCODE project (http://www.fragencode.org) aimed to profile the
landscape of transcription (RNA-seq), chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) and
conformation (Hi-C) in four livestock species representing ruminants (cattle,
goat), monogastrics (pig) and birds (chicken), using three target samples
related to metabolism (liver) and immunity (CD4+ and CD8+ T cells).
Results: RNA-seq assays considerably extended the available catalog of
annotated transcripts and identified differentially expressed genes with
unknown function, including new syntenic lncRNAs. ATAC-seq highlighted an
enrichment for transcription factor binding sites in differentially accessible
regions of the chromatin. Comparative analyses revealed a core set of
conserved regulatory regions across species. Topologically Associating
Domains (TADs) and epigenetic A/B compartments annotated from Hi-C data
were consistent with RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data. Multi-species
comparisons showed that conserved TAD boundaries had stronger insulation
properties than species-specific ones and that the genomic distribution of
orthologous genes in A/B compartments was significantly conserved across
species.
Conclusions: We report the first multi-species and multi-assay genome
annotation results obtained by a FAANG project. Beyond the generation of
reference annotations and the confirmation of previous findings on model
animals, the integrative analysis of data from multiple assays and species
sheds a new light on the multi-scale selective pressure shaping genome
organization from birds to mammals. Overall, these results emphasize the
value of FAANG for research on domesticated animals and reinforces the
importance of future meta-analyses of the reference datasets being
generated by this community on different species.

Background
Most complex trait-associated loci lie outside protein-coding regions, and comparative genomics studies have shown that the majority of mammalian-conserved and recently adapted regions consist of non-coding elements [1–3]. This evidence prompted
the first large-scale efforts into genome annotation for human and model organisms
[4–6]. The genome-wide annotation maps generated by these projects helped to shed
light on the main features of genome activity. For example, chromatin conformation
or transcription factor occupancy at regulatory elements can often be directly tied
to the biology of the specific cell or tissue under study [3, 7, 8]. Moreover, although
a subset of core regulatory systems are largely conserved across humans and mice,
the underlying regulatory systems often diverge substantially [9–11], implying that
understanding the phenotypes of interest requires organism-specific information for
any specific physiological phase, tissue and cell.
The Functional Annotation of Animal Genomes (FAANG) initiative (www.faang.
org) aims to support and coordinate the community in the endeavor of creating
reference functional maps of the genomes of domesticated animals across different
species, tissues and developmental stages, with an initial focus on farm and companion animals [12–15]. To achieve high quality functional annotation of these genomes,
FAANG carries out activities to standardize core biochemical assay protocols, coordinate and facilitate data sharing. It also establishes an infrastructure for the
analysis of genotype-to-phenotype data (www.faang.org, www.faang-europe.org).
Substantial efforts are being dedicated to farm animal species, as deciphering the
genotype-to-phenotype relationships underlying complex traits such as production
efficiency and disease resistance is a prerequisite for exploiting the full potential of
livestock [12].
Here we report the main results of a pilot project (FR-AgENCODE, www.
fragencode.org) launched at the beginning of the FAANG initiative. The broad
aim was to generate standardized FAANG reference datasets from four livestock
species (cattle, goat, chicken and pig) through the adaptation and optimization of
molecular assays and analysis pipelines. We first collected a panel of samples from
more than 40 tissues from two males and two females of four species: Bos taurus
(cattle, Holstein breed), Capra hircus (goat, Alpine breed), Gallus gallus (chicken,
White Leghorn breed) and Sus scrofa (pig, Large White breed), generating a total of
4,115 corresponding entries registered at the EMBL-EBI BioSamples database (see
Methods). For molecular characterization, three tissues were chosen to represent a
“hub” organ (liver) and two broad immune cell populations (CD4+ and CD8+ T
cells). This allowed the acquisition of a partial representation of energy metabolism
and immunity functions, as well as the optimization of the protocols for experimental assays for both tissue-dissociated and primary sorted cells. In addition to the
transcriptome, we analyzed chromatin accessibility by the assay for transposaseaccessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq, [16]), and we characterized the
three-dimensional (3D) genome architecture by coupling proximity-based ligation
with massively parallel sequencing (Hi-C, [17]) (Figure 1). Using this combination
of tissues/assays, we assessed the expression of a large set of coding and non-coding
transcripts in the four species, evaluated their patterns of differential expression in
light of chromatin accessibility at promoter regions, and characterized active and

inactive topological domains of these genomes. The integrative analysis showed a
global consistency across all data, emphasizing the value of a coordinated action to
improve the genomic annotation of livestock species, and revealed multiple layers
of evolutionary conservation from birds to mammals.

Results and discussion
High-depth RNA-seq assays provide gene expression profiles in liver and immune
cells from cattle, goat, chicken and pig
For each animal (two males, two females) of the four species, we used RNA-seq to
profile the transcriptome of liver, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (see Methods, Figure 1
and Table S1). We prepared stranded libraries from polyA+ selected RNAs longer
than 200bp, and we sequenced them on an Illumina HiSeq3000 (see Methods).
Between 250M (chicken) and 515M (goat) read pairs were obtained per tissue on
average, of which 94% (chicken) to 98% (pig) mapped to their respective genome
using STAR [18, 19] (see Methods, Figure S1 and Tables S2-S4). As an initial
quality control step, we processed the mapped reads with RSEM [20] to estimate the
expression levels of all genes and transcripts from the Ensembl reference annotation
(hereafter called “reference” genes/transcripts/annotation) (Table S2, Figure S1
and supplementary data file 2). As expected, a large majority of the reads (from
62% in cattle to 72% in goat) fell in annotated exons of the reference genes (Figure
S2). In spite of the specialized scope of this initial study limited to liver and immune
cells, a large share of all reference genes were detected (from 58% in chicken to 65%
in goat), even considering only transcript isoforms with an expression level higher
than 0.1 TPM in at least two samples (see Methods and Table 1).
For each species, we explored the similarity among samples using the expression
profiles of the reference genes. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed quite
consistent patterns across species, where the first principal component (explaining
84 to 91% of the variability among samples) clearly separated samples according to
their tissue of origin (liver vs. T cells). A more moderate yet systematic separation
was observed between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells on the second principal component
(Figure S3). The consistency of these patterns across species supports the reliability
of our RNA-seq data.
To compare the expression pattern of reference genes between species, we first
checked that the male-to-female expression ratio was globally uniform genome-wide
with the exception of the sex chromosomes in chicken (Figure S4). Dosage compensation (leading for instance to X chromosome inactivation in mammals) can indeed
be observed in all species except chicken, which is consistent with previous reports
on dosage compensation [21]. Next, we hierarchically clustered our samples using
the expression of 9,461 genes found to be orthologous across the four species (Figure 2, Methods and supplementary data file 3). Regardless of the species, liver and
T cell samples clustered separately. For T cells, samples clustered first by species
and then by subtypes (i.e. CD4+ versus CD8+). For most species and tissues, samples also clustered by sex, possibly due in part to the physiological state of females
in lactation or laying eggs. These results confirm the higher conservation of the liver
compared to the immune system gene expression program across vertebrates, and
highlight the fact that when RNA-seq is performed on multiple tissues and species,
samples could primarily cluster by either factor [22, 23].

Most reference genes are differentially expressed between liver and T cells
To provide functional evidence supporting our RNA-seq data, we performed a differential gene expression analysis across tissues per species for each gene in the
reference annotation. The number of exonic reads was first counted for each gene
and was then TMM-normalized [24] (see Methods). Taking into account the specificities of our experimental design, in which samples from different tissues come
from the same animal, we fitted generalized linear models (GLM) to identify genes
with differential expression in either all pairwise comparisons between liver, CD4+
and CD8+ (model 1), or liver versus T cells globally (model 2).
As expected, the liver to T cell comparison yielded the largest number of differentially expressed genes, and relatively few genes were found to be differentially
expressed between the two T cell populations (CD4+ and CD8+, see Table S5 and
supplementary data file 4). Strikingly, most genes showed significantly different expression between liver and immune cells in each species (from 7,000 genes in chicken
to 10,500 genes in goat), reflecting the difference between the physiological functions
of these highly specialized cell types in line with findings from the GTEx project
[25]. Accordingly, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis provided results in line with the
role of liver in metabolism and of T cells in immunity for all species (Figures S5-8
and Methods).
In accordance with the results of the hierarchical clustering (Figure 2), most
orthologous genes found to be differentially expressed between CD4+ and CD8+ T
cells within species showed high variability of expression levels across species (not
shown). This variability is likely caused by the natural heterogeneity in the relative
proportions of T cell subtypes among the different species, as already reported
between mammals [26, 27]. Nevertheless, 39 orthologous genes could consistently
differentiate CD4+ and CD8+ in the four species, including mammals and chicken,
which is significantly more than expected by chance (p-value < 10−3 , permutation
test). Among those, 10 and 29 genes showed significant overexpression in CD4+
and CD8+ cells respectively (Table S6). We searched for the human orthologs of
theses genes in the baseline expression dataset of human CD4+ and CD8+ αβ T cell
subsets generated by the Blueprint Epigenome Project [28, 29] and considered their
relative enrichment in each cell subset. With one exception (ACVRL1 ), all genes
were found to be expressed in human CD4+ and/or CD8+ αβ T cells and 25 of them
showed a relative enrichment in CD4+ (or CD8+) human cells consistent with our
data across the four species. Out of these 25 genes, six and eight genes, respectively,
could be associated with CD4+ and CD8+ T cell differentiation, activation and
function according to the literature (Table S6).
Analysis of new transcripts improves and extends gene structure annotation
In order to test if our data could improve the reference gene annotation for each
species, we used STAR and Cufflinks to identify all transcripts present in our samples and predict their exon-intron structures. We then quantified their expression
in each sample using STAR and RSEM (see Methods and Figure S1) and only retained the transcripts and corresponding genes expressed in at least two samples
with TPM ≥ 0.1. We identified between 58,000 and 85,000 transcripts depending on
the species (Table 1, supplementary data file 5), hereafter called “FR-AgENCODE
transcripts”.

To characterize these FR-AgENCODE transcripts with respect to the reference
transcripts, we grouped them into four positional classes (see Methods): (1) known:
a FR-AgENCODE transcript whose exon-intron structure is strictly identical to a
reference transcript (i.e. exact same exons and introns); (2) extension: same as (1),
but the FR-AgENCODE transcript extends a reference transcript by at least 1 bp
on at least one side; (3) alternative: a FR-AgENCODE transcript that shares at
least one intron with a reference transcript but does not belong to the previous
categories (only multi-exonic transcripts can be in this class); and (4) novel : a FRAgENCODE transcript that does not belong to any of the above categories. We
found that most FR-AgENCODE transcripts (between 37% for goat and 49% for
chicken) were of the alternative class, therefore enriching the reference annotation
with new splice variants of known genes (Table S7). The proportion of completely
novel transcripts was relatively high for cattle, which is likely due to the incompleteness of the UMD3.1 version of the Ensembl annotation used at the time of the
study (Figure S9, Tables 1, S2 and S7).
In order to identify interesting new transcripts involved in immunity and
metabolism, we first selected the novel FR-AgENCODE coding transcripts that
unambiguously project to a single human coding gene. We identified 93 (cattle), 52
(goat), 74 (chicken), 26 (pig) genes, of which 12 are common to at least 2 livestock
species (see Methods, Table S8, Figure S10A and supplementary data file 6). Gene
set enrichment analyses on these gene lists confirmed their relevance for T cell biology (Figure S10B) and the added value of the FR-AgENCODE novel transcripts in
terms of annotation of complex but important loci like TRBV and TRAV (Figure
S10C).
In addition, we performed a differential gene expression analysis similar to the
one done on reference genes (see above and Methods). Results were globally similar, with more than 88% of correspondence between the differentially expressed
genes from the reference and the FR-AgENCODE annotation (Figure S11, Table
S5, S9, supplementary data file 7). Among the latter, between 202 (chicken) and
1,032 (goat) genes were coding (at least one coding transcript predicted by FEELnc
– see below) and did not overlap any reference gene on the same strand. This highlights the potential to identify novel interesting candidates for further functional
characterization.
Identification, classification and comparative analysis of lncRNAs
Since deep RNA-seq libraries allow the detection of weakly expressed transcripts
[30], we sought to identify the proportion of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)
among the FR-AgENCODE transcripts. Using the FEELnc classifier [31] trained
on the reference annotation (see Methods), we identified from 7,502 (chicken) to
22,724 (cattle) lncRNA transcripts, among which a large majority were not previously reported (Tables S10-11 and supplementary data file 8). The high number of
lncRNAs found in cattle is likely due in part to the incomplete genome annotation
and genome assembly used at the time of the study (Table S2). Consistent with
previous reports in several species including human [32], dog [31], and chicken [33],
predicted lncRNA genes had lower expression levels than reference protein-coding
genes (Figure S12). The structural features of these predicted lncRNA transcripts

were consistent between the four species: lncRNAs are spliced but with fewer exons
(1.5 vs. 10) and higher median exon length (660 vs. 130bp) compared to mRNAs
(Figure S12). LncRNAs are also smaller than mRNAs (1800 vs. 3600bp). Notably,
the lower number of exons and consequent smaller size of lncRNAs compared to
mRNAs could also be due to the weaker expression of lncRNAs, which makes their
structure more difficult to identify [34].
In addition to the coding/non-coding classification, FEELnc can also categorize
lncRNAs as intergenic or intragenic based on their genomic positions with respect
to a provided set of reference genes (usually protein coding), and considering their
transcription orientation with respect to these reference genes. This analysis revealed an overwhelming majority of intergenic lncRNA genes over intragenic ones
(Table S10), which is consistent with results obtained in human [32] and in chicken
[33].
We and others previously showed a sharp decrease in lncRNA sequence conservation with increasing phylogenetic distance [32, 33, 35], in particular between chicken
and human that diverged 300M years ago. We therefore analyzed lncRNA conservation between the four livestock species using a synteny approach based on the
orthology of protein-coding genes surrounding the lncRNA and not on the lncRNA
sequence conservation itself [33] (see Methods). We found 73 such conserved, or
syntenic, lncRNAs across cattle, goat and pig, 19 across cattle, chicken and pig,
and 6 across all four species (supplementary data file 8). All were expressed in these
species and located in the same orientation with respect to the flanking orthologous genes. An example of such a conserved lncRNA, hitherto unknown in our
four species, is provided in Figure 3. In human, this lncRNA is called CREMos
for “CREM opposite sense” since it is in a divergent position with respect to the
neighboring CREM protein-coding gene. Interestingly, synteny is conserved across
species from fishes to mammals and the CREMos lncRNA is overexpressed in T
cells while the CREM protein-coding gene is overexpressed in liver in goat, cattle
and chicken (Figure 3). Additional examples of syntenic lncRNAs are provided in
supplementary data file 8, and the ones found to be conserved between the 4 species
are represented in Figure S13.
Landscape of chromatin accessibility in cattle, goat, chicken and pig
We used ATAC-seq to profile the accessible chromatin of liver, CD4+ and CD8+
T cells in animals from the four species. Between 480M (chicken) and 950M (pig)
ATAC-seq fragments were sequenced per species, and were processed by a standard
pipeline (Methods and Figure S14). Peaks were called in each tissue separately (see
Methods), resulting in between 26,000 (pig, liver) and 111,000 (pig, cd8) peaks per
tissue (Table S12). Those peaks were further merged into a unique set of peaks per
species, resulting in between 75,000 (goat) and 149,000 (pig) peaks (Table S12 and
supplementary data file 9), covering 1 to 5% of the genome. The average peak size
was around 600 bp for all species, except for chicken where it was less than 500 bp.
Merging tissue peaks did not result in much wider peaks (Figure S15).
In comparison to the reference annotation, about 10-15% of the peaks lie at 5Kb
or less from a Transcription Start Site (TSS) and can be considered to be promoter
peaks. The precise distribution of these promoter peaks showed a clear higher accumulation at the TSS for all species (Figure 4), supporting the quality of both the

annotation and our data. Importantly, this signal was also observed around the TSS
of novel FR-AgENCODE transcripts (i.e. those not from the known class; Figure
S16).
The vast majority of the peaks, however, were either intronic or intergenic (Figure 4, Figure S17, supplementary data file 9), similar to GWAS variants associated
with human diseases [3]. In particular, from 38% (goat) to 55% (cattle) of the peaks
were located at least 5Kb away from any reference gene (Figure S17), indicating
that ATAC-seq can detect both proximal and distal regulatory regions.
Since active enhancers are expected to be enriched in chromatin regions that are
both accessible and tagged with specific histone modification marks, we compared
our ATAC-seq peaks to histone ChIP-seq peaks from another functional genomics
study [36]. In that study, two histone modification marks (H3K4me3 and H3K27ac)
were profiled in the genome of 20 mammals including pig, for which we have ATACseq data in the same tissue (liver). Although only a small proportion of the ChIPseq peaks overlapped our liver ATAC-seq peaks (2.8% of the 8,538 H3K4me3 peaks
and 4.1% of the 25,502 H3K27ac peaks), this proportion was significantly higher
than expected by chance as measured by shuffling peak positions (p-value = 0.017
and p-value = 0.026 respectively, permutation test). Interestingly, this subset of
overlapping peaks have significantly higher q-value signal scores than their nonoverlapping counterparts (p-value = 8 × 10−6 , p-value = 1.6 × 10−5 and p-value
< 2.2 × 10−16 for ATAC-seq, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac scores respectively, Wilcoxon
tests), which confirms the existence of a common signal between the datasets.
To further characterize functional regulatory sites in our samples, we compared
chromatin accessibility between liver and T cells. The ATAC-seq peaks of each
species were quantified in each sample and resulting read counts were normalized
using a loess correction (see Methods). A differential analysis similar to the one
used for RNA-seq genes was then performed on normalized counts (see Methods).
We identified from 4,800 (goat) to 13,600 (chicken) differentially accessible (DA)
peaks between T cells and liver (Table S13 and supplementary data file 10). To test
for the presence of regulatory signals in these regions, we computed the density of
transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) in ATAC-seq peaks genome-wide. Interestingly, TFBS density was significantly higher in DA ATAC-seq peaks compared
to non-DA ATAC-seq peaks (Model 2; p-value < 7.1 × 10−4 for goat and p-value
< 2.2 × 10−16 for chicken and pig, Wilcoxon tests, see Methods). This enrichment
was also observed for distal ATAC-seq peaks, at least 5kb away from promoters (not
shown), and suggests that differentially accessible peaks are more likely to have a
regulatory role than globally accessible peaks.
Promoter accessibility is associated with both positive and negative regulation of
gene expression
Accessible promoters are commonly associated with gene activation [37, 38]. Given
the specific distribution of the ATAC-seq signal, we initially focused on proximal
chromatin peaks (i.e. at 1Kb or less from a gene TSS) and used them to assign
a promoter accessibility value to each gene. Using normalized read counts (see
Methods), we investigated the correlation between ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data
either across all genes within each sample, or across all samples for each gene.

Within each sample, genes with highly accessible promoters showed higher expression values globally (Figure S18), as already reported in mouse and human [39]. For
pig and goat, the number of available samples further allowed us to compute for
each gene the correlation between promoter accessibility and gene expression across
all samples (Figure S19 and Methods). Interestingly, while the correlation value
distribution appeared to be unimodal for non-differentially expressed genes, it was
bimodal for differentially expressed genes, with an accumulation of both positive
and negative correlation values (Figures 5 and S19). This pattern supports the existence of different types of molecular mechanisms (i.e. both positive and negative)
involved in gene expression regulation.
Comparative genomics reveals a core set of conserved chromatin accessible sites
We then investigated the evolution of chromatin accessibility genome-wide by performing a comparative analysis of all (proximal and distal) conserved ATAC-seq
peaks across species. We identified conserved peaks by aligning all the sequences
that correspond to peaks from each species (both proximal and distal) to the human genome (see Methods). Most peaks could be mapped globally, with an expected
strong difference between mammals (72%-80% of the peaks) and chicken (12% of the
peaks). After keeping the best sequence hits, merging them on the human genome
and retaining the unambiguous ones (see Methods), we obtained a set of 212,021
human projections of livestock accessible chromatin regions, that we call human
hits.
A large majority of the human hits (about 86%) originated from a single livestock species, which is consistent with previous reports about the fast evolution
of regulatory elements and the species-specific feature of many enhancers [5, 36].
Nevertheless, the remaining 28,292 human hits (14%) had a conserved accessibility
across two or more livestock species (Methods and supplementary data file 13). As
they share both sequence conservation and experimental evidence between several
species, we refer to those human hits as “orthologous peaks” and to the number of
species sharing the peak as its “orthology level”. Among them, 1,083 orthologous
peaks had an orthology level of 4, i.e. shared by all 4 livestock species. Human hits
from a single species were assigned an orthology level of 1. As previously done with
the orthologous genes using RNA-seq data, we performed a hierarchical clustering
of the samples based on the normalized accessibility values of the peaks with an orthology level of 4 (Figure S21). Contrary to what was observed from the expression
data, samples here mostly clustered according to species first, with the chicken as a
clear outlier. However for the two phylogenetically closest species (goat and cow),
we observed that all T cells clustered together, separately from liver. This suggests
a stronger divergence and specialization of the regulatory mechanisms compared to
the gene expression programs.
In addition, shuffling the peak positions within each species did not drastically
change the mapping efficiency on the human genome overall but resulted in a much
lower proportion of orthologous peaks (from 14% to 3% human hits with an orthology level > 1, see Methods). Also, the overlap on the human genome between
all the 212,021 human hits and ENCODE DNAse I hypersensitive sites from liver
and T cell samples [40] was three to four times higher than with the random set of
shuffled peaks (25-39% per species vs. 7-9%).

Lastly, human hits that were identified as differentially accessible between liver
and T cells in at least one of the species had higher PhastCons conservation scores
on the human genome than the non differential peaks of the same orthology level
(Figure 6). This difference was significant for three out of the four orthology levels (p-values < 0.01 overall, Wilcoxon tests), supporting a selective pressure on
functionally active regulatory regions. Remarkably, this contrast was even stronger
after discarding human hits close to a TSS in any of the species (Figure S22, pvalues < 10−6 overall, Wilcoxon tests, supplementary data file 12), in line with
a specific conservation of distal regulatory elements beyond the promoter regions.
Altogether, these results highlight a core set of conserved regulatory regions from
birds to mammals that include both proximal and distal sites.
Comprehensive maps of topological domains and genomic compartments in goat,
chicken and pig
In order to profile the structural organization of the genome in the nucleus, we
performed in situ Hi-C on liver cells from the two male and the two female samples of
pig, goat and chicken. The in situ Hi-C protocol was applied as previously described
[41] with slight modifications (see FAANG protocols online and Methods). Reads
were processed using a bioinformatics pipeline based on HiC-Pro [42] (Methods).
From 83 to 91% of the reads could be genomically mapped depending on the sample,
and after filtering out all inconsistent mapping configurations we obtained a total of
182, 262 and 290M valid read pairs in goat, chicken and pig respectively (Table S14
and Figure S23). These sequencing depths allowed us to build interaction matrices
(or Hi-C contact heatmaps) at the resolution of 40 and 500Kb in order to detect
Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) and A/B compartments respectively
(Figures S24-25).
We identified from ≈ 5,400 (chicken) to 11,000 (pig) TADs of variable sizes (150
to 220Kb on average, Table S15 and supplementary data file 12), with a 90-92%
genome-wide coverage. To validate these domains predicted by armatus [43] (see
Methods), we computed three metrics along the genome: the Directionality Index
(DI), to quantify the degree of upstream or downstream interaction bias for any
genomic region [44], the local interaction score to represent the insulation profile
along the genome [45, 46], and the density of in silico predicted CTCF binding
sites, expected to be prevalent at TAD boundaries [47, 48]. For each species, we
observed that the distribution of these three metrics was consistent with previous
reports on model organisms (Figure 7 and Figure S26), supporting the relevance of
our topological annotation.
At a higher organizational level, we identified “active” (A) and “inactive” (B)
epigenetic compartments as defined by [17] (see Methods and Figure S24). We obtained from ≈ 580 to 700 compartments per genome with a mean size between 1.6Mb
(chicken) and 3.4Mb (goat) and covering between 71.9% (goat) and 88.6% (pig) of
the genome (see Table S15 and supplementary data file 11). We also observed high
consistency of the compartments between replicates (same compartment for 80%
of the loci in all 4 animals, see Figure S27). In model organisms, A compartments
represent genomic regions enriched for open chromatin and transcription compared
to B compartments [44]. By using RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data from the same liver

samples as those for which we had Hi-C data, we observed that both the average
gene expression and the average chromatin accessibility were significantly higher
in A than in B compartments (Figure 8, p-value < 2.2 × 10−16 for each comparison, Wilcoxon tests), emphasizing the biological consistency of our results across
all molecular assays and species.
Genome structure comparison reveals a multi-scale selective pressure on
topological features across evolution
It has been shown that the general organization in TADs tends to be conserved
across species [48, 49] and that the presence of specific TAD boundaries can be
crucial for biological functions like development [50]. In line with these reports,
we wondered if TAD boundaries might play a fine grain regulatory role beyond a
binary model of simple absence/presence. Under this assumption, we hypothesized
that the insulating capacity of conserved TAD boundaries could be under selective
pressure. We therefore assessed the link between their insulation potential and their
evolutionary conservation.
As previously done with ATAC-seq peaks (see Methods and above) we first
mapped all the TAD boundaries from each species to the human genome to identify
the orthologous ones. Pairwise comparisons of their local interaction scores showed
a clear correlation between our species (Figure 9A). Since the interaction score here
reflects the proportion of cis-contacts across a TAD boundary, such a correlation
supports a conservation of the insulation strength between adjacent TADs. Strikingly, similar correlations were obtained between each of our mammalian species and
human (GM12878 cell line, see Methods and Figure 9B-C) [41]. Beside confirming a
general conservation of the TAD structure throughout evolution, these results emphasize the quantitative nature of this activity, in line with previous findings [48].
Moreover, a conserved insulation level at TAD boundaries suggests various degrees
of functional impact and a fine control of their regulatory role, involving complex
molecular mechanisms.
To further characterize this link between conservation and TAD strength, we
assigned to each boundary an orthology level depending on the number of livestock species with a common hit on the human genome, as we did for ATAC-seq
peaks (see above and supplementary data file 13). In all 3 species, we observed that
the higher the orthology level of TAD boundaries, the lower the interaction score
(Figure 9D). These results revealed that TAD boundaries under stronger selective
pressure had higher insulation activities and, expectedly, a more important role in
terms of genome architecture and regulatory function.
Unlike TADs, chromosomal A/B compartments have often been reported as highly
variable between tissues or developmental stages, involving dynamic mechanisms of
epigenetic control [51–53]. Here, we postulated that despite its plasticity, the structural organization in genome compartments for a given tissue could also be under
selective pressure across a large phylogenetic spectrum. As active compartments are
known to be gene-rich we first confirmed that, although both compartment types
roughly have the same size, most genes were found in A compartments in each
species (Figure S27). In addition, we observed that the general proportion of genes
in A compartments was remarkably stable across species (66.9%, 69.7% and 70.1%

of all genes in chicken, goat and pig respectively). The 5,728 orthologous genes with
a predicted compartment in all three species were also found to be preferentially localized in active compartments, with slightly higher proportions than for all genes in
general (69.5%, 75.9%, and 76.4% for chicken, goat, and pig respectively), probably
due to the fact that conserved genes tend to have higher expression levels.
Since all these orthologous genes were assigned a compartment type (i.e. A or B
label) in each species separately, we tested whether any significant conservation of
compartment type across species could be detected. Among the 5,728 orthologous
genes, 3,583 had the same compartment type in all species, which was 49% more
than expected by chance assuming independence between species. This cross-species
conservation was observed for both A and B compartments (p-value < 2.2×10−17 for
both, χ2 goodness-of-fit test), suggesting that such conservation was not restricted
to regions of higher gene expression.
Altogether, results from the cross-species comparisons of ATAC-seq peaks, TAD
boundaries and A/B compartments reveal a general conservation of the genome
structure at different organizational levels from birds to mammals, and sheds a new
light on the complex interplay between genome structure and function.

Conclusion
We report the first multi-species and multi-assay genome annotation results obtained by a FAANG project. The main outcomes were consistent with our expectations and provide new evolutionary insights about regulatory and structural aspects
of the genome:
 Despite only three different tissues being used, a majority of the reference
transcripts could be detected. Moreover, the newly identified transcripts considerably enrich the reference annotations of these species.
 Differential analyses of gene expression in liver and T cells yielded results consistent with known metabolism and immunity functions and identified novel
interesting candidates for functional analyses, including conserved syntenic
lncRNAs.
 ATAC-seq data allowed an abundance of potential regulatory regions to be
mapped, and, upon integration with RNA-seq data, suggested complex mechanisms of gene expression regulation. Comparative genomics analyses revealed
evolutionary conservation both for proximal and distal regulators.
 Hi-C experiments provided the first set of genome-wide 3D interaction maps of
the same tissue from three livestock species. Beyond the chromosome topology annotation, the analysis showed high consistency with gene expression
and chromatin accessibility. Multi-species analyses revealed a global selective
pressure on organizational features of the genome structure at different scales,
beyond the TAD level.
Therefore, the FR-AgENCODE group has delivered a strong proof of concept of a
successful collaborative approach at a national scale to apply FAANG guidelines to
various experimental procedures and animal models. This notably includes the set
up of a combination of sequencing assays on primary cells and tissue-dissociated
cells, as well as a large collection of documented tissue samples available for further
molecular characterization in future projects. It also confirmed, in line with several

studies in model species [4–6, 8] the value of combining molecular assays on the same
samples to simultaneously identify the transcriptomes and investigate underlying
regulatory mechanisms.
In the context of the global domesticated animal genome annotation effort, lessons
learned from this pilot project confirm conclusions drawn by the FAANG community regarding the challenges to be addressed in the future [12]. Furthermore, the
mosaic nature of a global annotation effort that gathers contributions from various
partners worldwide emphasizes the challenge of translating recent advances from
the field of data science into efficient methods for the integrative analysis of ‘omics
data and the importance of future meta-analyses of several datasets [15].
Altogether, these annotation results will be useful for future studies aiming to
determine which subsets of putative regulatory elements are conserved, or diverge,
across animal genomes representing different phylogenetic taxa. This will be beneficial for devising efficient annotation strategies for the genomes of emerging domesticated species.

Methods
Animals, sampling and tissue collections
Animals and breeds
Well-characterized breeds were chosen in order to obtain well-documented samples.
Holstein is the most widely used breed for dairy cattle. For goats, the Alpine breed is
one of the two most commonly used dairy breeds, and for pigs, the Large white breed
is widely used as a dam line. For chickens, the White Leghorn breed was chosen as
it provides the genetic basis for numerous experimental lines and is widely used for
egg production.
Four animals were sampled for each species, two males and two females. They all
had a known pedigree. Animals were sampled at an adult stage, so that they were
sexually mature and had performance records, obtained in known environmental
conditions. Females were either lactating or laying eggs.
All animals were fasted at least 12 hours before slaughter. No chemicals were
injected before slaughtering, animals were stunned and bled in a licensed slaughter
facility at the INRA research center in Nouzilly.
Samples
Liver samples of 0.5 cm3 were taken from the edge of the organ, avoiding proximity
with the gallbladder and avoiding blood vessels. Time from slaughter to sampling
varied from 5 minutes for chickens to 30 minutes for goats and pigs and 45 minutes
for cattle. For the purpose of RNA-seq, samples were immediately snapfrozen in
liquid nitrogen, stored in 2ml cryotubes and temporarily kept in dry ice until final
storage at -80°C.
For mammals, whole blood was sampled into EDTA tubes before slaughter; at
least one sampling took place well before slaughter (at least one month) and another
just before slaughter, in order to obtain at least 50 ml of whole blood for separation
of lymphocytes (PBMC). PBMC were re-suspended in a medium containing 10%
FCS, counted, conditioned with 10% DMSO and stored in liquid nitrogen prior to
the sorting of specific cell types: CD3+CD4+ (“CD4”) and CD3+CD8+ (“CD8”).

For chicken, spleen was sampled after exsanguination. Spleen leucocytes were purified by density-gradient separation to remove nucleated erythrocytes contamination
and stored in liquid nitrogen prior to CD4+ and CD8+ T cell sorting.
All protocols for liver sampling, PBMC separation, splenocyte purification and
T cell sorting can be found at ftp://ftp.faang.ebi.ac.uk/ftp/protocols/
samples/
Experimental assays and protocols
All assays were performed according to FAANG guidelines and recommendations,
available at http://www.faang.org. All detailed protocols used for RNA extraction
and libraries production for RNA-seq, ATAC-seq and Hi-C are available at http:
//ftp.faang.ebi.ac.uk/ftp/protocols/assays/.
RNA extraction
Cells and tissues were homogenized in TRIzol reagent (Thermo) using an ULTRATURRAX (IKA-Werke) and total RNAs were extracted from the aqueous phase.
They were then treated with TURBO DNase (Ambion) to remove remaining genomic DNA and then processed to separate long and small RNAs using the mirVana
miRNA Isolation kit. Small and long RNA quality was assessed using an Agilent
2100 Bioanalyzer and RNA 6000 nano kits (Agilent) and quantified on a Nanodrop
spectrophotometer.
RNA-seq
Stranded mRNA libraries were prepared using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample
Prep Kit -V2 (Illumina) on 200 ng to 1µg of total long RNA with a RNA Integrity
Number (RIN) over 8 following the manufacturer’s instructions. Libraries were PCR
amplified for 11 cycles and library quality was assessed using the High Sensitivity
NGS Fragment Analysis Kit DNF-474 and the Fragment Analyser system (AATI).
Libraries were loaded onto a High-seq 3000 (Illumina) to reach a minimum read
numbers of 100M paired reads for each library.
Hi-C
In situ Hi-C libraries were made according to [41] with a few modifications. For all
species, fresh liver biopsies were dissociated using Accutase, and each resulting cell
suspension was filtered using a 70 µm cell strainer. Cells were then fixed with 1%
formaldehyde for 10 minutes at 37°C and fixation was stopped by adding Glycine
to a final concentration of 0.125M. After two washes with PBS, cells were pelleted
and kept at -80°C for long term storage. Subsequently, cells were thawed on ice and
5 million cells were processed for each Hi-C library. Cell membranes were disrupted
using a potter-Elvehjem PTFE pestle and nuclei were then permeabilized using
0.5% SDS with digestion overnight with HindIII endonuclease. HindIII-cut restriction sites were then end-filled in the presence of biotin-dCTP using the Klenow large
fragment and were religated overnight at 4°C. Nucleus integrity was checked using
DAPI labelling and fluorescence microscopy. Nuclei were then lysed and DNA was
precipitated and purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter)
and quantified using the Qubit fluorimetric quantification system (Thermo). Hi-C

efficiency was controlled by PCR using specific primers for each species and, if this
step was successful, DNA was used for library production. DNA was first treated
with T4 DNA polymerase to remove unligated biotinylated ends and sheared by
sonication using a M220 Covaris ultra-sonicator with the DNA 550pb SnapCap
microtube program (Program length: 45s; Picpower 50; DutyF 20; Cycle 200; Temperature 20°C).
Sheared DNA was then size-selected using magnetic beads, and biotinylated fragments were purified using M280 Streptavidin Dynabeads (Thermo) and reagents
from the Nextera Mate Pair Sample preparation kit (Illumina). Purified biotinylated DNA was then processed using the TrueSeq nano DNA kit (Illumina) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Libraries were amplified for 10 cycles and
then purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads. Library quality was assessed on
a Fragment Analyser (AATI) and by endonuclease digestion using NheI endonuclease. Once validated, each library was sequenced on an Illumina Hi-Seq 3000 to
reach a minimum number of 150M paired reads per library. Libraries from the cattle
samples failed the Quality Control steps (proportion of mapped reads, number of
valid interactions) and were not included in the analysis.
ATAC-seq
ATAC-seq libraries were prepared according to Buenrostro et al. (2013) with a few
modifications. For liver, cells were dissociated from the fresh tissue to obtain a single
cell suspension. Cells were counted and 50,000 cells were processed for each assay.
Transposition reactions were performed using the Tn5 Transposase and TD reaction
buffer from the Nextera DNA library preparation kit (Illumina) for 30 minutes at
37°C. DNA was then purified using the Qiagen MinElute PCR purification kit.
Libraries were first amplified for 5 cycles using custom-synthesized index primers
(see supplementary methods) and then a second amplification was performed. The
appropriate number of additional PCR cycles was determined using real-time PCR,
permitting the cessation of amplification prior to saturation. The additional number
of cycles needed was determined by plotting the Rn versus Cycle and then selecting
the cycle number corresponding to one-third of the maximum fluorescent intensity.
After PCR amplification, libraries were purified using a Qiagen MinElute PCR
purification kit followed by an additional clean-up and sizing step using AMPure
XP beads (160 µl of bead stock solution was added to 100 µl of DNA in EB
buffer) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Library quality was assessed on
a BioAnalyser (Agilent) using Agilent High Sensitivity DNA kit (Agilent), and
libraries were quantified using a Qubit Fluorometer (Thermo). Considering that
the Hi-C protocol was not successful on the liver samples from cattle, ATAC-seq
was not attempted on these samples either.
Bioinformatics and Data Analysis
All software used in this project along with the corresponding versions are listed
in Table S3. The reference gene annotation was obtained from the Ensembl v90
release (pig: Sscrofa11.1, chicken: GalGal5, cattle: UMD3.1, goat: ARS1). Since
Capra hircus was not part of the Ensembl release, we used the NCBI CHIR 1.0.102
annotation (see Table S2).

RNA-seq
RNA-seq pipeline
Prior to any processing, all RNA-seq reads were trimmed using cutadapt version 1.8.3. Reads were then mapped twice using STAR v2.5.1.b [18, 19]: first on
the genome indexed with the reference gene annotation to quantify expression of
reference transcripts, and secondly on the same genome indexed with the newly
generated gene annotation (FR-AgENCODE transcripts) (see below and Figure
S1) [54]. The STAR --quantMode TranscriptomeSAM option was used in both
cases in order to additionally generate a transcriptome alignment (bam) file. After read mapping and CIGAR-based softclip removal, each sample alignment file
(bam file) was processed with Cufflinks 2.2.1 [55, 56] with the max-intron-length
(100000) and overlap-radius (5) options, guided by the reference gene annotation
(--GTF-guide option) ([54], Figure S1). All cufflinks models were then merged into
a single gene annotation using Cuffmerge 2.2.1 [55, 56] with the --ref-gtf option.
The transcript and gene expressions on both the reference and the newly generated
gene annotation were quantified as TPM (transcripts per million) using RSEM 1.3.0
[20] on the corresponding transcriptome alignment files ([54], Figure S1). The newly
generated transcripts were then processed with FEELnc version 0.1.0 [31] in order
to classify them into “lncRNA”, “mRNA” and “otherRNA” (Figure S1, Tables S910, Figure S9). The newly generated transcripts with a TPM value of at least 0.1 in
at least 2 samples were called FR-AgENCODE transcripts and kept as part of the
new annotation. The 0.1 threshold was chosen knowing that the expression values of
polyadenylated transcripts usually go from 0.01 to 10,000 [30] and that we wanted
to simultaneously capture long non coding RNAs that are generally lowly expressed
and reduce the risk of calling artefactual transcripts.
PCA based on gene expression
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed using the mixOmics R package [57] on the RNA-seq sample quantifications of each species. This was done using
the expression (TPM) of two different sets of genes: reference genes with TPM 0.1
in at least two samples (Figure S3) and FR-AgENCODE genes with TPM 0.1 in at
least two samples (Figure S11).
Annotated gene orthologs
We used Ensembl Biomart [58] to define the set of orthologous genes across cattle,
chicken and pig. Only “1 to 1” orthology relationships were kept (11,001 genes).
Since goat was not part of the Ensembl annotation, goat gene IDs were added to this
list using gene name as a correspondence term. The resulting 4-species orthologous
set contained 9,461 genes (supplementary data file 3).
RNA-seq sample hierarchical clustering
Based on the expression of the 9,461 orthologous genes in the 39 RNA-seq samples from the four species, the sample-by-sample correlation matrix was computed
using the Pearson correlation of the log10 gene TPM values (after adding a pseudocount of 10−3 ). We then represented this sample by sample correlation matrix as a
heatmap where the samples were also clustered using a complete linkage hierarchical
clustering (Figure 2).

RNA-seq normalization and differential analysis
To perform the differential analysis of gene expression, we used the expected read
counts provided by RSEM [20]. RNA-seq library size normalization factors were
calculated using the weighted Trimmed Mean of M-values (TMM) approach of [59]
as implemented in the R/Bioconductor package edgeR [24]. The same package was
used to fit three different per-gene negative binomial (NB) generalized log-linear
models [60].
 In Model 1, the expression of each gene was explained by a tissue effect;
because all three tissues (liver, CD4, CD8) were collected from each animal,
an animal effect was also included to account for these repeated measures:
log µgi
= βg,tissue(i) + γg,animal(i) ,
si
where µgi represents the mean expression of gene g in sample i, si the
TMM normalization factor for sample i, tissue(i) ∈ {liver, CD4, CD8} and
animal(i) ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4} the tissue and animal corresponding to sample i, and
βg,tissue(i) and γg,animal(i) the fixed tissue and animal effects, respectively, of
gene g in sample i. Hypothesis tests were performed to identify significantly
differentially expressed genes among each pair of tissues, e.g.
H0g : βg,liver = βg,CD4 .
 Model 2 is identical to the previous model, where gene expression was modeled using both a tissue and an animal effect, with the exception that the CD4
and CD8 tissues were collapsed into a single group. In this model, the only
hypothesis of interest is thus between the liver and global CD cell group:

H0g : βg,liver = βg,CD .
All hypothesis tests were performed using likelihood-ratio tests and were corrected
for multiple testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg (FDR, [61]) procedure. Genes
with an FDR smaller than 5% and an absolute log-fold change larger than 2 were
declared differentially expressed.
GO analysis of differentially expressed genes
For each species, GO term enrichment analysis was performed on the genes found
to be over- or under-expressed in liver versus T cells. This analysis was done
separately for each species (Figures S5-S7) and subsequently for genes identified
for all species (Figure S8), using the three following ontologies: biological process
(BP), molecular function (MF) and cell compartment (CC), and using the GOstat
R/Bioconductor package [62]) for only those genes with a human ortholog.
FR-AgENCODE transcript positional classification
The FR-AgENCODE transcript models were first classified according to their
position with respect to reference transcripts:
known
the FR-AgENCODE transcript is strictly identical to a reference
transcript (same intron chain and same initial and terminal exons)

extension

alternative

novel

the FR-AgENCODE transcript extends a reference transcript
(same intron chain but one of its two most extreme exons extends
the reference transcript by at least one base pair)
the FR-AgENCODE transcript corresponds to a new isoform (or
variant) of a reference gene, i.e. the FR-AgENCODE transcript
shares at least one intron with a reference transcript but does not
belong to the above categories
the FR-AgENCODE transcript is in none of the above classes

FR-AgENCODE transcript coding classification
The FR-AgENCODE transcript models were also classified according to their
coding potential. For this, the FEELnc program (release v0.1.0) was used to discriminate long non-coding RNAs from protein-coding RNAs. FEELnc includes three
consecutive modules: FEELncfilter , FEELnccodpot and FEELncclassifier . The first
module, FEELncfilter , filters out non-lncRNA transcripts from the assembled models, such as transcripts smaller than 200 nucleotides or those with exons strandedly
overlapping exons from the reference annotation. This module was used with default parameters except -b transcript_biotype=protein_coding, pseudogene
to remove novel transcripts overlapping protein-coding and pseudogene exons from
the reference. The FEELnccodpot module then calculates a coding potential score
(CPS) for the remaining transcripts based on several predictors (such as multi
k-mer frequencies and ORF coverage) incorporated into a random forest algorithm [63]. In order to increase the robustness of the final set of novel lncRNAs
and mRNAs, the options --mode=shuffle and --spethres=0.98,0.98 were set.
Finally, the FEELncclassifier classifies the resulting lncRNAs according to their
positions and transcriptional orientations with respect to the closest annotated
reference transcripts (sense or antisense, genic or intergenic) in a 1Mb window
(--maxwindow=1000000).
It is worth noting that between 83 and 2,718 lncRNA transcripts were not classified because of their localization on the numerous unassembled contigs in livestock
species with no annotated genes.
FR-AgENCODE gene conservation between species
In order to obtain gene orthology relationships, we projected FR-AgENCODE
transcripts from the four livestock species to the human GRCh38 genome using the UCSC pslMap program (https://github.com/ENCODE-DCC/kentUtils/
tree/master/src/hg/utils/pslMap, v302). More precisely, we used the UCSC
hg38To[species.assembly].over.chain.gz chain file for each species (created
in-house for goat following UCSC instructions) and retained only the best hit for
each transcript (according to the pslMap score). We further required each FRAgENCODE gene to project to a single human gene that did not strandedly overlap
any other projected FR-AgENCODE gene.
Syntenic conservation of lncRNAs
Briefly, a lncRNA was considered as “syntenically” conserved between two species
if (1) the lncRNA was located between two orthologous protein-coding genes, (2)
the lncRNA was the only one in each species between the two protein-coding genes
and (3) the relative gene order and orientation of the resulting triplet was identical

between species. Using these criteria, we found six triplets shared between the four
species, 73 triplets shared between cattle, goat and pig, and 19 triplets shared
between cattle, chicken and pig.
ATAC-seq
ATAC-seq data analysis pipeline
ATAC-seq reads were trimmed with trimgalore 0.4.0 using the --stringency 3,
-q 20, --paired and --nextera options (Table S3). The trimmed reads were then
mapped to the genome using bowtie 2 2.3.3.1 with the -X 2000 and -S options [64].
The resulting sam file was then converted to a bam file with samtools 1.3.1, and
this bam file was sorted and indexed with samtools 1.3.1 [65]. The reads for which
the mate was also mapped and with a MAPQ ≥ 10 were retained using samtools
1.3.1 (-F 12 and -q 10 options, [65]), and finally only the fragments where both
reads had a MAPQ ≥ 10 and which were on the same chromosome were retained.
Mitochondrial reads were then filtered out, as well as duplicate reads (with picard tools, MarkDuplicates subtool). The highest proportion of filtering was due
to the MAPQ 10 and PCR duplicate filters (Figure S14). The peaks were called
using MACS2 2.1.1.20160309 [66] in each tissue separately using all the mapped
reads from the given tissue (-t option) and with the --nomodel, -f BAMPE and
--keep-dup all options. To get a single set of peaks per species, the tissue peaks
were merged using mergeBed version 2.26.0 [67]. These peaks were also quantified
in each sample by simply counting the number of mapped reads overlapping the
peak.
ATAC-seq peaks were also classified with respect to the reference gene annotation
using these eight genomic domains and allowing a peak to be in several genomic

ATAC-seq differential analysis: normalization and model.
Contrary to RNA-seq counts, ATAC-seq counts exhibited trended biases visible
in log ratio-mean average (MA) plots between pairwise samples after normalization
using the TMM approach, suggesting that an alternative normalization strategy was
needed. In particular, trended biases are problematic as they can potentially inflate

variance estimates or log fold-changes for some peaks. To address this issue, a fast
loess approach [68] implemented in the normOffsets function of the R/Bioconductor
package csaw [69] was used to correct differences in log-counts vs log-average counts
observed between pairs of samples.
As for for RNA-seq, we used two different differential models: Model 1 for tissue
pair comparisons, Model 2 for T cell versus liver comparisons (see corresponding
RNA-seq section for more details).
ATAC-seq peak TFBS density.
In order to identify Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBS) genome-wide, we
used the FIMO [70] software (Table S3) to look for genomic occurrences of the
519 TFs catalogued and defined in the Vertebrate 2016 JASPAR database [71].
We then intersected these occurrences with the ATAC-seq peaks of each species
and computed the TFBS density in differential vs non differential ATAC-seq peaks.
Among the predicted TFBSs, those obtained from the CTCF motif were used to
profile the resulting density with respect to Topological Associating Domains from
Hi-C data (Figure 7).
Comparison between ATAC-seq peaks and ChIP-seq histone mark peaks.
Pig liver H3K4me3 and H3K27ac ChIP-seq peaks from the Villar et al. study
[36] were downloaded from ArrayExpress (experiment number E-MTAB-2633).
As these peaks were provided on the 10.2 pig genome assembly, they were first
lifted over to the 11.1 pig genome assembly using the UCSC liftover program
(https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/LiftOver). About 76.8% (8,538 out of
11,114) of the H3K4me3 peaks and 75.2% (25,502 out of 33,930) of the H3K27ac
peaks could be lifted over to the 11.1 genome assembly. The median peak size was
1900 bp for H3K4me3 and 2701 bp for H3K27ac, and the peak size distribution
was very similar for the initial 10.2 and the lifted over 11.1 peaks. As for genome
coverage, the H3K4me3 and H3K27ac peaks covered 0.7% and 3.9% of the 11.1 pig
genome, respectively. In comparison, there were 25,885 pig liver ATAC-seq peaks
with a median size of 360 bp and covering 0.5% of the pig genome. Consistent
with what was expected from the two histone marks, the vast majority (94.9%)
of the H3K4me3 peaks (known to be associated to promoter regions) overlapped
(bedtools intersect program) with the H3K27ac peaks (known to be associated to
both promoter and enhancer regions), and about 30% of the H3K27ac peaks overlapped with the H3K4me3 peaks. Comparing our pig liver ATAC-seq peaks to the
histone mark peaks, we found that 1.0% (250 out of 25,885) and 4.3% (1109 out of
25,885) of our ATAC-seq peaks overlapped with the H3K4me3 and H3K27ac peaks,
respectively. Reciprocally, 2.8% (242 out of 8,538) and 4.1% (1,036 out of 25,502)
of the H3K4me3 and H3K27ac peaks respectively overlapped with our ATAC-seq
peaks, which is rather small. It was noted that, for a given kind of peak, the peaks
common to the two techniques (ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq) were not longer than the
other ones (not shown).
Although a rather small percentage of the ChIP-seq peaks (2.8% and 4.1%) overlapped with the ATAC-seq peaks, we wanted to know whether these numbers were
higher than expected by chance. We therefore shuffled (bedtools shuffle program)
the 25,885 pig liver ATAC-seq peaks 1,000 times on the pig genome and recomputed

their intersection with the two sets of histone mark peaks (H3K4me3 and H3K27ac).
After doing so, only 18 and 30 times did we get percentages of H3K4me3 and
H3K27ac peaks, respectively, overlapping the shuffled ATAC-seq peaks that were
equal or higher than the ones obtained with the real ATAC-seq peaks. This means
that indeed, 2.8% and 4.1% of the histone mark peaks overlapping our ATAC-seq
peaks are percentages that are significantly higher than expected by chance (p-value
= 0.018 and p-value = 0.030).
We also compared the ATAC-seq, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac peak scores (fold enrichment against random Poisson distribution with local lambda for ATAC-seq
peaks and fold-enrichment over background for ChIP-seq peaks) of the common
peaks versus the other peaks. In doing so, we found that common peaks had significantly higher scores than non common peaks (median 49 versus 41, p-value
= 8 × 10−6 for ATAC-seq peaks, median 59 versus 44, p-value = 1.6 × 10−5 for
H3K4me3 peaks and median 20 versus 14, p-value < 2.2 × 10−16 for H3K27ac
peaks, Wilcoxon tests), highlighting a common signal between the two techniques.
Chromatin accessibility conservation across species.
In order to investigate the conservation of chromatin accessibility across our 4
livestock species, we used the human GRCh38 genome as a reference. After indexing
the softmasked GRCh38 genome (main chromosomes) using lastdb (last version 956,
-uMAM4 and -cR11 options, http://last.cbrc.jp/), we used the lastal program
followed by the last-split program (-m1 and –no-split options) (last version 956,
http://last.cbrc.jp/) to project the 104,985 cattle, 74,805 goat, 119,894 chicken
and 149,333 pig ATAC-seq peaks onto the human genome. In doing so and consistent
with the phylogenetic distance between our species and human, we were able to
project 72.6% (76,253) cattle, 73.7% (55,113) goat, 12.3% (14,792) chicken and
80.1% (119,680) pig peaks to the human genome. The percentage of bases of the
initial peaks that could be aligned was around 40% for mammals and 14% for
chicken. Then, for each peak that could be projected onto the human genome, we
retained its best hit (as provided by lastal) and then merged all these best hits
(i.e. from the 4 species) on the human genome (using bedtools merge). A total of
215,620 human regions were obtained, from which we kept the 212,021 that came
from a maximum of 1 peak from each species. Those 212,021 regions were called
human hits.
Based on the 1,083 four-species orthologous peaks in the 38 ATAC-seq samples,
the sample-by-sample correlation matrix was computed using the Pearson correlation of the log10 normalized ATAC-seq values (after adding a pseudo-count of 10−3
to the values). We then represented this sample-by-sample correlation matrix as
a heatmap where the samples were also clustered using a complete linkage hierarchical clustering (Figure S21). Chicken ATAC-seq samples clustered completely
separately from mammal ATAC-seq samples. T cell samples from cattle and goat
were also closer to each other than to liver samples.
To shuffle the 104,985 cattle, 74,805 goat, 119,894 chicken and 149,333 pig ATACseq peaks we used the bedtools shuffle program on their respective genomes and
projected these shuffled peaks to the human genome as was done for the real peaks.
We also compared the human hits to the combined set of 519,616 ENCODE human DNAse I peaks from two CD4+, two CD8+ and one “right

ENCSR020LUD, ENCSR316UDN, ENCSR555QAY from the encode portal https:
//www.encodeproject.org/, by merging the peaks from the 5 samples into a single
set of peaks using bedtools merge). We found that 23.1% (48,893 out of 212,021) of
the human hits obtained from the real ATAC-seq peaks overlapped human DNAse
I peaks, whereas only 8.5% (21,159 out of 249,943) of the human hits obtained from
shuffled ATAC-seq peaks overlapped human DNAse I peaks. This further supports
the biological signal present in these data.
Finally we used the phastcons measure of vertebrate sequence conservation obtained from the multiple alignment of 100 vertebrate species genomes including
human (hg38.phastCons100way.bw bigwig file from the UCSC web site https://
genome.ucsc.edu/). For each human hit, we computed its phastcons score using the
bigWigAverageOverBed utility from UCSC (https://github.com/ENCODE-DCC/
kentUtils).

FILTER_HIGH_COUNT_PERC = 0, EPS =0.1. TAD finding was done using Armatus
V2.1 [43] with default parameters and gamma=0.5 (Table S3). Graphical visualization of the matrices was produced with the HiTC R/Bioconductor package
v1.18.1 [42] (Table S3). Export to JuiceBox [74] was done through Juicer Tools
v0.7.5 (Table S3). These tools were called through a pipeline implemented in
Python. Because of the high number of unassembled scaffolds (e.g. for goat) and/or
micro-chromosomes (e.g. for chicken) in our reference genomes, only the longest 25
chromosomes were considered for TAD and A/B compartment calling. For these
processes, each chromosome was considered separately.
The Directionality Index (DI) was computed using the original definition introduced by [44] to indicate the upstream vs. downstream interaction bias of each
genomic region. Interaction matrices of each chromosome were merged across replicates and the score was computed for each bin of 40Kb. CTCF sites were predicted
along the genomes by running FIMO with the JASPAR TFBS catalogue (see section
“ATAC-seq peak TFBS density”).
A/B compartments were obtained using the method described in [17] as illustrated
in Figure S2: first, ICE-normalized counts, Kij , were corrected for a distance effect

b ij is the distance-corrected count for the bins i and j, K d is the average
in which K
count over all pairs of bins at distance d = d(i, j) and σ d is the standard deviation of the counts over all pairs of bins at distance d. Within-chromosome Pearson
correlation matrices were then computed for all pairs of bins based on their distancecorrected counts and a PCA was performed on this matrix. The overall process was
performed similarly to the method implemented in the R/Bioconductor package
HiTC [42]. Boundaries between A and B compartments were identified according
to the sign of the first PC (eigenvector). Since PCAs had to be performed on
each chromosome separately, the average counts on the diagonal of the normalized
matrix were used to identify which PC sign (+/-) should be assigned to A and
B compartments for each chromosome. This allowed a homonegenous assignment
across chromosomes to be obtained, without relying on the reference annotation. In
line with what was originally observed in humans, where the first PC was the best
criterion for separating A from B compartments (apart from a few exceptions like
chromosome 14 for instance [17]), we also observed a good agreement between the
plaid patterns of the normalized correlation matrices and the sign of the first PC
(Figure S24).
To estimate the robustness of A/B compartment calling, the method was tested
on each replicate separately (four animals). Since the HiTC filtering method can
discard a few bins in some matrices, resulting in missing A/B labels, the proportion
of bins with no conflicting labels across replicates was computed among the bins
that had at least two informative replicates (Figure S27).
Chromatin structure conservation across species.
To get insight into chromatin structure conservation across species, similar to what
was done with chromatin accessibility data (see above), we projected the 11,711
goat, 6,866 chicken and 14,130 pig 40kb TAD boundaries to the human GRCh38
genome using lastal followed by last-split (-m1 and --no-split options, last version
956, http://last.cbrc.jp/, using the same indexed GRCh38 softmasked genome
as was used for ATAC-seq, see above). As expected from their length, TAD boundary
projections were highly fragmented (median 16, 2 and 19 blocks per projection
representing 3%, 0.6% and 3% of the initial segment, for the best hit of goat,
chicken and pig, respectively). In order to recover conserved segments, we chained
the alignments using a python in-house script (program available on demand, used
with stranded mode, coverage=0.4, score=3000 and length_cutoff=5000). Doing
so, we managed to project 90% of the mammalian and 5% of the chicken TAD
boundaries onto the human genome. Similar to what was done for ATAC-seq, for
each projected TAD boundary, its best hit (according to the chaining score) was
retained. The median length of those best hits represented 95% and 78% of the
initial query size for mammals and chicken respectively. Merging these best hits on
the human genome (using bedtools merge), we obtained 16,870 human regions with
a median length of 44.6kb (similar to the initial TAD boundary size of 40kb). Out
of those, 16,468 were considered non ambiguous (i.e. not coming from several TAD
boundaries from the same species) and were retained for further analyses. As was
found for the ATAC-seq peaks, the majority (65.6%) of the hits were single species
(orthology level 1), a substantial percentage of them (34%) were 2 species hits

(orthology level 2), and seventy one of them (0.4%) were 3 species hits (orthology
level 3).
To estimate the structural impact of each TAD boundary, we used the local interaction score as used by [45] and [46] and sometimes referred to as “interaction ratio” or “insulation profile”. Within a sliding window of 500kb along the
genome (step=10Kb), the insulation score ratio is defined as the proportion of read
pairs that span across the middle of the window. The score ratio is reported at
the middle position of the window and represents the local density of the chromatin contacts around this point. This proportion is expected to be maximal in
regions with many local interactions (typically TADs) and minimal over insulators (typically TAD boundaries). Intuitively, a TAD boundary with a low interaction score (which indicates strong insulation properties) has a good capacity
to prevent interactions that cross it while a TAD with a relatively high interaction score has a “weak” insulation strength. Here, only valid interactions (“valid
pairs”) in in cis (inter-chromosomal contacts were not considered in the ratio) were
considered after applying all HiC-Pro QC and filters. Computing a ratio among
all read pairs that have both reads within the sliding window reduces the impact of potential biases (read coverage, restriction site density, GC content, etc).
Consequently, the interaction profiles from the 4 replicates along the genome of
each species were highly similar (not shown), allowing to merge them in order
to assign each TAD boundary a single score per species. For orthologous TAD
boundaries, the scores from different species could be used to compute pairwise
correlations. Human data were obtained from http://aidenlab.org/data.html
[41] for the GM12878 cell line (ENCODE batch 1, HIC048.hic file from https:
//bcm.app.box.com/v/aidenlab/file/95512487145). The .hic file was parsed by
the juicer tool (“dump” mode with options “observed KR”) to compute the corresponding interaction score as described above. The LiftOver tool was used to convert
the genomic positions of the human TAD boundaries (version hg19 vs. hg38) before
comparing the interaction scores with livestock species.
The number and proportion of genes (all or only the orthologous ones) in each
compartment type was computed using bedtools map (-distinct option on the
gene ID field). Orthologous genes were taken from Ensembl as previously described.
Under the independence assumption of compartment assignment between species,
the expected proportion of orthologous genes with “triple A” (resp. with “triple
B”) assignments between species is equal to the product of the observed frequencies
for A (resp. for B) compartments in the three species. The observed frequencies of
“triple A” and “triple B” assignments in orthologous genes was compared to this
expected proportion using a χ2 goodness-of-fit test.
Multi-assay integration
ATAC-seq vs. RNA-seq correlation: intra- and inter-sample analysis.
For each ATAC-seq peak that overlapped a promoter region (1Kb upstream of the
TSS, as suggested in Figure 4) its loess-normalized read count value (see differential
analysis) was associated with the TMM-normalized expression of the corresponding
gene from the reference annotation. Intra- and inter-sample correlations were then
investigated: within each sample, genes were ranked according to their expressions

and the distribution of the corresponding ATAC-seq values was computed for each
quartile (Figure S17). Across samples, the Pearson correlation coefficient was computed for each gene using only the samples for which both the ATAC-seq and the
RNA-seq normalized values were available (e.g. n = 10 for pig, Figures S18-19).
Similar results were obtained with Spearman correlations (not shown).
Chromatin accessibility and gene expression in A/B compartments.
To compute the general chromatin accessibility in A and B compartments, we first
computed the average of the normalized read count values across all liver samples for
each ATAC-seq peak. For each compartment, the mean value of all contained peaks
was then reported and the resulting distributions for all A and B compartments
were reported (Figure 8).
The same approach was used to assess the general expression of genes in A and
B compartments, using the average of the normalized expression values from the
liver samples. Difference between A and B distributions was tested for statistical
significance using a Wilcoxon test.

Figure 2 RNA-seq sample heatmap and hierarchical clustering based on the expression of
the 9,461 orthologous genes across the four species. Pairwise similarity between samples is
computed as the Pearson correlation between the base 10 logarithm of the expression (TPM) of
the 9,461 orthologous genes. These similarities are plotted as a heatmap, where samples appear
both as rows and columns and are labelled by their species, tissue and the sex of the animal. The
color of each heatmap cell also reflects the similarity (Pearson correlation) between each sample
pair (the lighter, the higher). Hierarchical clustering is performed using one minus the squared
Pearson correlation as a distance and the complete linkage aggregation method.

computed genome-wide relatively to TSS positions (x-axis). The proportion of ATAC-seq peaks
within the [−1; +1]Kb interval is represented by the shaded area between the dotted lines. The
corresponding percentage is indicated above the double arrow, indicating that most of the

Figure 5 Correlation between gene expression and promoter accessibility in pig. For each
expressed FR-AgENCODE gene with an ATAC-seq peak in the promoter region, the Pearson
correlation was computed between the base 10 logarithm of the RNA-seq gene expression (TMM)
and the base 10 logarithm of the ATAC-seq chromatin accessibility (normalized by csaw). The
distribution is represented for genes with no significant differential expression between liver and T
cells (A, top) and for differentially expressed genes (B, bottom). The distribution obtained for
differentially expressed genes showed an accumulation of both positive and negative correlation
values, suggesting a mixture of regulatory mechanisms.

Figure 6 Relationship between chromatin accessibility conservation and differential
accessibility Phastcons scores of ATAC-seq human hits were plotted after dividing the human hits
according to both their orthology level (between 1 and 4, x-axis) and their differential accessibility
(DA) status (DA in at least one species or DA in none of the 4 species, boxplot color). Although the
phastcons score obviously increases with the orthology level, it is clear that, for a given orthology
level, the phastcons score is higher for DA human hits than for non DA human hits (all orthology
levels except 3, p-values < 0.01 overall, Wilcoxon tests) (number of elements in the boxplots from
left to right: 163509, 21578, 16329, 4437, 6231, 6231, 2241, 878, 417).

accessibility values (normalized read counts, bottom panel) is shown per compartment type. A:
“active” compartments. B: “repressed” compartments. As Hi-C data was only available from liver,
only RNA-seq and ATAC-seq values from the same samples were considered. The significant and
systematic difference of gene expression and chromatin accessibility values between A and B
compartments (p-values < 2.2 × 10−16 overall, Wilcoxon tests) confirms a general consistency
between RNA-seq, ATAC-seq and Hi-C data across species.

Figure 9 Relationship between chromatin structure conservation and functionality
Interaction scores of orthologous TAD boundaries between Goat and Pig (A), Goat and Human (B)
and Pig and Human (C). (D) For each species with Hi-C data, TAD boundaries were divided
according to their orthology level (1, 2 and 3, x-axis and boxplot colours) and their interaction
scores were plotted (y-axis). There is a clear decrease of the interactions core with the TAD
boundary orthology level, indicating a stronger insulation for more evolutionarily conserved TAD
boundaries.

Tables
Table 1 Reference and FR-AgENCODE detected transcripts. This table provides the total number
of reference transcripts for each species, the number and percent of those that were detected by
RNA-seq (TPM ≥ 0.1 in at least 2 samples), the total number of FR-AgENCODE transcripts, and the
subsets of them that were mRNAs (known and novel) and lncRNAs (known and novel). Overall, the
transcript repertoire is increased by about 100% in all species but cattle, where it is more than tripled.
