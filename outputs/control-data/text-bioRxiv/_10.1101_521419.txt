ABSTRACT

15

Genome editing via the homology-directed repair (HDR) pathway in somatic plant cells

16

is very inefficient compared to error-prone repair by nonhomologous end joining

17

(NHEJ). Here, we increased HDR-based genome editing efficiency approximately 3-fold

18

compared to a Cas9-based single-replicon system via the use of de novo multi-replicon

19

systems equipped with CRISPR/LbCpf1 in tomato and obtained replicon-free but stable

20

HDR alleles. The efficiency of CRISPR/LbCpf1-based HDR was significantly modulated

21

by physical culture conditions such as temperature and light. Ten days of incubation at

22

31°C under a light/dark cycle after Agrobacterium-mediated transformation resulted in

the best performance among the tested conditions. Furthermore, we developed our

single-replicon system into a multi-replicon system that effectively increased HDR

efficiency. Although this approach is still challenging, we showed the feasibility of HDR-

the HKT1;2 HDR allele showed stable inheritance and germination tolerance in the

INTRODUCTION

35

In plant somatic cells, double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) are efficiently repaired by a

36

nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) mechanism, which dominates over the homology-directed

37

repair (HDR) pathway (Jiang et al., 2013; Puchta, 2005). NHEJ repair usually leads to various

38

types of mutations including DNA sequence insertions, deletions (Hsu et al., 2014; Zetsche et al.,

39

2015), chromosome rearrangement, or chromosome relocation (Ferguson and Alt, 2001;

40

Richardson et al., 1998; Varga and Aplan, 2005). Early in the 1990s, a transgenic approach using

41

yeast mitochondrial I-Sce I endonuclease as a DSB inducer was adopted in attempts to

42

investigate the mechanisms of DSB repair in plants, especially gene targeting via the HDR

43

pathway in plant somatic cells (Fauser et al., 2012; Puchta et al., 1993), which have been the

44

main targets of recent plant genome engineering approaches (Baltes et al., 2014; Belhaj et al.,

45

2013; Čermák et al., 2015; Nekrasov et al., 2013). In plant somatic cells, the HDR pathway

46

employs homologous DNA templates to precisely repair damaged DNA, mainly via the

47

synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) mechanism, with an extremely low efficiency

48

(Puchta et al., 1996; Szostak et al., 1983), leading to difficulties in practical applications.

49

Therefore, research on plant gene targeting has continued to focus on improving HDR efficacy.

50

Previously reported data have indicated two most important factors affecting HDR efficiency in

51

plant somatic cells: DSB formation and the amount of homologous DNA templates available at

52

sites of breakage (Baltes et al., 2014; Endo et al., 2016; Puchta, 2005; Puchta et al., 1993;

53

Townsend et al., 2009).

54

The recent development of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats

55

(CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein system has provided excellent molecular scissors

56

for the generation of DSBs. Streptococcus pyogenes Cas 9 (SpCas9) (Sapranauskas et al., 2011)

57

and Lachnospiraceae bacterium Cas12a (LbCas12a or LbCpf1) (Zetsche et al., 2015) have been

58

adapted for wide use in genome engineering studies in various kingdoms including Plantae

59

(Barrangou and Doudna, 2016; Hsu et al., 2014; Jinek et al., 2012). The former system generally

60

generates blunt ends (Jinek et al., 2012) at DSBs, while the latter cuts in a cohesive end

61

configuration (Zetsche et al., 2015). As a consequence of DSB repair by NHEJ, the two types of

62

CRISPR complexes exhibit comparably high indel mutation rates under in vivo conditions, thus

63

proving to be ideal tools for DSB formation for initiating targeted HDR in plants. Furthermore, it

64

has been suggested that the Cpf1 complex might present an advantage in HDR-based genome

65

editing compared to the Cas9 complex because the cutting site of Cpf1 is located distal to the

66

core target sequence and the protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM), potentially allowing recutting

67

even after indel mutations are introduced during NHEJ-mediated repair (Zetsche et al., 2015;

68

Lowder et al., 2016). CRISPR/Cpf1 complexes were recently successfully applied for gene

69

targeting in plants (Li et al., 2018), providing alternative options for T-rich target site selection.

70

Because of the highly efficient replication of geminivirus genomes and their single-stranded

71

DNA nature, these genomes have been used as an ideal DNA template carrier for gene targeting

72

in plants. Geminiviral genomic DNAs have been reconstructed to exogenously overexpress

73

foreign proteins in plants at up to 80-fold higher levels compared to those of conventional T-

74

DNA systems (Mor et al., 2003; Needham et al., 1998; Zhang and Mason, 2006), due to their

75

highly autonomous replication inside host nuclei and the ability to reprogram cells (Gutierrez,

76

1999; Hanley-Bowdoin et al., 2013). Furthermore, Rep/RepA has been reported to promote a cell

77

environment that is permissive for homologous recombination to stimulate the replication of

78

viral DNA. Interestingly, it has been reported that somatic homologous recombination is

79

promoted by geminiviral infection (Richter et al., 2014). The above characteristics of geminiviral

80

replicons have been shown to make them ideal delivery tools for introducing large amounts of

81

homologous donor templates to plant nuclei. Likewise, a bean yellow dwarf virus (BeYDV)–

82

based replicon was developed by replacing its movement protein and coat protein genes with

83

Cas9 or TALEN to improve gene targeting in plants (Baltes et al., 2014; Butler et al., 2016;

84

Čermák et al., 2015; Dahan-Meir et al., 2018; Gil-Humanes et al., 2017; Hummel et al., 2018).

85

The LbCpf1 complex, which was subsequently discovered and adapted for genome editing in

86

2015, has not been tested in combination with geminiviral replicon systems for plant gene

87

targeting.

88

Despite higher success rates in gene targeting in plants using the geminiviral replicon system,

89

most of the reported cases have required selection markers associated with the edited alleles,

90

indicating that plant gene targeting without the use of selection markers is still challenging

91

(Butler et al., 2016; Gil-Humanes et al., 2017; Hummel et al., 2018). In addition, the effective

92

application of replicon cargos in plant gene targeting has been shown to be limited by their

93

size (Baltes et al., 2014; Suarez-Lopez and Gutierrez, 1997). Therefore, plant gene targeting,

94

especially in cases of selection marker-free alleles, still requires improvement. Here, we report

95

significant improvement of homology-directed repair using CRISPR/LbCpf1-geminiviral multi-

96

replicons in tomato and the successful application of the system to target a marker-free salt-

97

tolerant HKT1;2 allele.

98

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

99

The CRISPR/LbCpf1-based geminiviral replicon system is feasible for performing HDR in

100

tomato

101

To test the hypothesis above, we re-engineered a BeYDV replicon to supply a high dose of

102

homologous donor templates and used the CRISPR/LbCpf1 system (Zetsche et al., 2015) for

103

DSB formation (Figure 1A and 1B). Two long intergenic regions (LIR) of BeYDV (pLSLR)

104

(Baltes et al., 2014) were cloned in the same orientation with a short intergenic region (SIR)

105

inserted between them, generating an LIR-SIR-LIR amplicon unit (Data S1). To support the

106

autonomous replication of the replicon, the Rep/RepA coding sequence was also introduced in

107

cis (in the center of the 3’ side, SIR-LIR) and transcriptionally driven by the bidirectional

108

promoter activity of the LIR. This cloning strategy interrupted a possible upstream ORF of

109

Rep/RepA and added an AAA Kozak consensus sequence (Kozak, 1981) upstream of the

110

major ATG of Rep (Supplemental Figure 1A and 1B; Data S1), thus potentially contributing

111

to increasing the translation of the Rep protein (Barbosa et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2018). The

112

selection of HDR events was performed with a double selection/screening system based on

113

kanamycin resistance and anthocyanin overproduction (Figure 1A; Supplemental Figure 2A

114

and 2B; Data S1).

115

To validate our system, the LbCpf1 expression cassette driven by the CaMV 35S promoter

116

and 5’UTR with AtUBI10 intron I (to suppress silencing effects (Christie et al., 2011)), guide

117

RNA scaffolds driven by the AtU6 promoter (Data S1) (Belhaj et al., 2013) and donor

118

templates were cloned into the de novo-engineered geminiviral DNA replicon (Figure 1B) and

119

transformed via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation into tomato cotyledon explants. The

120

de novo-engineered geminiviral DNA replicon system exhibited efficient and durable

121

maintenance of circularized DNAs in mature tomato leaves (Supplemental Figure 3). The

122

LbCpf1 system using two guide RNAs for targeting the ANT1 gene, a key transcription factor

123

controlling the anthocyanin pathway, showed a much higher HDR efficiency, of 4.51±0.63%

124

(normalized to an overexpression construct (pANT1 ox, Figure 1B)), than the other control

125

constructs, including the “minus Rep” (pRep -) and “minus gRNA” (pgRNA-) constructs

126

(Figure 1C; Supplemental Table 1A). LbCpf1 system-based HDR events was visualized by

127

the presence of purple calli and/or shoots (Figure 1C and 1D), and its efficiency was similar to

128

that of a CRISPR/SpCas9-based construct (pTC217) (Čermák et al., 2015) included in the

129

same experiment (Figure 1C; Supplemental Table 1A) or used in hexaploid wheat with the

130

same scoring method (Gil-Humanes et al., 2017). It is worth noting that the normalized HDR

131

efficiencies reported from this study (see Materials and Methods section) using transformed

132

cell-based efficiency are calculated differently from those reported in the initial work by

133

Čermák and coworkers (2015). The data obtained from this experiment revealed that

134

functional geminiviral replicons were crucial for increasing HDR efficiencies of the Cpf1

135

complex, as shown for Cas9 system (Čermák et al., 2015). This result shows the feasibility of

136

highly efficient HDR in plants using Cpf1 expressed from a geminiviral replicon, thus

137

expanding the choices of molecular scissor system for gene targeting in plants.

138

Favorable physical conditions significantly increase the HDR efficiency of the

139

CRISPR/LbCpf1-based geminiviral replicon system

140

In seeking suitable physical conditions for Agrobacterium-mediated delivery and DSB repair

141

using our HDR tool in tomato somatic cells, we investigated various incubation regimes at

142

early stages post-transformation. Short-day conditions have been shown to have strong

143

impacts on intrachromosomal recombination repair (ICR) in Arabidopsis (Boyko et al., 2005).

144

We tested whether the same could be true for the gene targeting approach in tomato. Using

145

various lighting regimes, including complete darkness (DD), short (8 hours light/16 hours

146

dark; 8 L/16 D)- and long (16 L/8 D)-day conditions, we found that the HDR efficiencies

147

achieved under short- and long-day conditions were higher than those under DD conditions in

148

the case of LbCpf1 but not SpCas9 and reached 6.62±1.29% (p<0.05, Figure 1E;

149

Supplemental Table 1B). Considering the similar repair activities observed after DSBs were

150

generated by either of the CRISPR/Cas systems, it was quite difficult to explain why the light

151

conditions only affected LbCpf1-based HDR in this experiment compared to the dark

152

treatment. There must be unknown mechanism(s) that facilitate LbCpf1-mediated HDR in a

153

light-dependent manner.

154

Temperature is an important factor controlling ICR (Boyko et al., 2005), CRISPR/Cas9-based

155

targeted mutagenesis in plants (LeBlanc et al., 2018), and CRISPR/Cpf1-based HDR in

156

zebrafish and Xenopus by controlling genome accessibility (Moreno-Mateos et al., 2017). In

157

addition, Malzahn and coworkers recently reported dependency of Cpf1 cleavage activity on

158

temperature (Malzahn et al., 2019). Pursuing the approach for the improvement of HDR, we

159

compared the HDR efficiencies of the pHR01 and pTC217 systems subjected to various

160

temperature treatments under an 8 L/16 D photoperiod, since the two nucleases (SpCas9 and

161

LbCpf1) may respond differently. Our data revealed that within a temperature range of 19-

162

31°C, the somatic HDR efficiency increased with increasing temperature (Figure 1F;

163

Supplemental Table 1C). Notably, at 31°C, LbCpf1 showed an HDR efficiency (9.80±1.12%)

164

that was more than 2-fold higher than that of SpCas9 (p<0.05) and was nearly twice that of a

165

similar system in hexaploid wheat (Gil-Humanes et al., 2017) as well as an LbCpf1-based T-

166

DNA tool in rice (Li et al., 2018). The results supported the principle of heat stress-stimulated

167

HDR in plants reported by Boyko and coworkers (2005). The ease of LbCpf1 at genome

168

accessibility at high temperatures (Moreno-Mateos et al., 2017) in combination with the ability

169

to repeatedly cut at the target sites (Zetsche et al., 2015) may explain the higher HDR

170

efficiency of LbCpf1 compared to that of SpCas9. The claims are supported by the pHR01

171

and pTC217 guide RNA activity analyses. The number of transformed events carrying indel

172

mutations was almost similar, but the average adjusted levels of mutation rate obtained from

173

the pHR01-based LbCpf1 (Supplemental Table 2B; Data S2) was nearly three-fold higher

174

than that of the SpCas9-based pTC217 events (Supplemental Table 2A; Data S2).

175

Interestingly, the LbCpf1 complex was shown to be highly active only at high temperatures

176

(i.e., more than 29°C) (Malzahn et al., 2019), which partially explains the higher HDR

177

efficiencies observed at high temperatures in this experiment. It is notable that a highly

178

efficient CRISPR/LbCpf1 mutant in low temperature was reported for plant gene editing

179

(Schindele and Puchta, 2019). Even the LbCpf1_gRNA1 appeared to be highly active at the

180

on-target site; no modification at two potential off-targeting sites was observed (Data S3).

181

Briefly, a comparison of data on plant HDR between Cas9- and Cpf1-based systems at

182

different temperatures and under short-day conditions is presented to reveal the best

183

conditions for plant HDR improvement.

184

A multi-replicon system outperformed the single-replicon system in HDR-based GE.

185

The size of viral replicons has been shown to be inversely correlated with their copy numbers

186

(Baltes et al., 2014; Suarez-Lopez and Gutierrez, 1997). In an approach to overcome the

187

replicon size limitation, we designed and tested the novel idea of using a T-DNA system that

188

potentially produces multiple replicons (Figure 2A, and Supplemental Figure 4). Compared to

189

pHR01, a multi-replicon system designed to release donor templates from replicon 2 (MR02)

190

but not replicon 1 (MR01) showed a significant increase in the HDR efficiency by 30% and

191

reached up to 12.79±0.37% (Figure 2B and Supplemental Table 3). Temporal evaluation of

192

donor template levels between the HDR tools showed significantly higher levels of MR02 at 3

193

days post-transformation (dpt) compared to those of pHR01 and MR01 (Figure 2C). The

194

highest donor template levels in multi-replicons tested were available while CRISPR/Cas was

195

generating DSBs at early times after transformation (3 dpt, Figure 2C), except for MR01

196

showing a peak at 6 dpt (Figure 2C). Under the same conditions and calculation methods, the

197

combination of our multi-replicons with LbCpf1 significantly increased HDR efficiencies by

198

3-4-fold compared to those of the Cas9-based replicon systems. We also confirmed the release

199

of three circularized replicons from the single vector used in this work (Figure 2D) by PCR

200

amplification using circularized replicon-specific primers (Supplemental Table 4).

201

In another test of the multi-replicon system, we overexpressed two key proteins involved in

202

the plant HDR pathway from the replicon 1 site. Either SlRAD51 (Solyc07g017540.2) or
9

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/521419; this version posted December 24, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

203

SlRAD54 (Solyc04g056400.2) was overexpressed with the multi-replicon tools (MR03 and

204

MR04) (Figure 2A; Data S1). Surprisingly, even when the donor template level of MR03 or

205

MR04 was nearly twice that of MR01 (Figure 2C), the HDR efficiency was not significantly

206

different in the case of MR03 and was even significantly lower for MR04 (Figure 2B and

207

Supplemental Table 3).The assessment of mRNA levels of SlRAD51 (Supplemental Figure

208

5A; Data S4) or SlRAD54 (Supplemental Figure 5B; Data S4) of transformed events of MR03

209

or MR04, respectively, showed higher relative transcript levels (up to 522.18 folds of

210

SlRAD51 and 83.68 folds of SlRAD54 transcripts) compared to multi-replicon control (MR02)

211

(Supplemental Figure 5; Data S4). Overexpression of SlRAD54 might increase the

212

displacement of SlRAD51 from SlRAD51-bound dsDNAs at the early stage of HDR initiation

213

(Petukhova et al., 1999), thereby suppressing HDR to some extent in the case of MR04 (Figure

214

2B). Overexpression of either SlRAD51 (MR03) or SlRAD54 (MR04) increased the 3-day

215

peaks of geminiviral replicons (replicon 2 and 3) at 30-50 % compared to the control (MR02)

216

(Figure 2C), confirming the positive roles of these proteins in geminivirus replication in a

217

homologous recombination manner, as reported elsewhere (Kaliappan et al., 2012; Richter et

218

al., 2016; Suyal et al., 2013). The data also revealed a temporal difference in the maximal

219

peaks of replicon 1 and 2 because replicon 1 was not accompanied by a Rep/RepA expression

220

cassette.

221

The multi-replicon system may provide more flexible choices for expressing multiple donor

222

templates/genes/genetic tools in plant cells with temporally controllable copy levels without

223

incurring an expression penalty from excess replicon sizes up to 18 kb (size of replicon 3

224

released by MR03). The validation of the multi-replicon system provides an excellent

225

alternative for genetic engineering in plants in addition to applications in plant genome

226

editing. If we carefully design and clone multiple donor templates or gene expression

227

cassettes into the multi-replicons, we can control donor templates/gene doses without

228

incurring penalties from excessing replicon size limitations.

229

True ANT1 HDR events occurred at high frequency

230

An important step in plant genome editing is the regeneration of edited calli into shoots. We

231

used kanamycin in our study to select edited calli and plants. Since we put a fully functional

232

NptII expression cassette into the ANT1 donor, we observed many WT-like calli and green

233

shoots arose from our plates. In the case, the purple marker was so much useful for us to

234

select HDR events. Our observation recorded a significantly higher number of both purple

235

spots per cotyledon and purple plants per cotyledon obtained from pHR01 and MR02

236

compared to that of pTC217 (Supplemental Table 5). However, the regeneration of the purple

237

calli into plants was not completely proportional probably due to pleiotropic impacts of the

238

new replicon systems. To verify HDR repair events, PCR analyses were conducted using

239

primers specific for the left (UPANT1-F1/NptII-R1) and right (ZY010F/TC140R) (Figure 1A;

240

Supplemental Table 6 and 7) junctions employing genomic DNAs extracted from derived

241

HDR events (independently regenerated purple plants or genome-edited generation 0 (GE0))

242

(Figure 3A, Supplemental Figure 6 and 7). For pHR01, all (16/16) of the analyzed

243

independent events showed the expected band for right junction integration, and 10/16

244

independent events showed the expected band for left junction repair (Figure 3B). The PCR

245

products were sequenced to identify junction sequences. A majority of the events (11/16)

246

showed sequences corresponding to perfect right arm integration through HDR repair, and

247

5/16 events showed a combination of HDR and NHEJ repair with an NHEJ fingerprint at the 5’

terminus of the pNOS sequence (Supplemental Figure 7A, with event C1.8 highlighted in blue)

or even an integration of the right board of T-DNA at the left junction boundary

250

(Supplemental Figure 8). All of the sequences amplified from the left junctions showed

251

perfected DNA sequence exchange via the HDR pathway (Supplemental Figure 7B). The

252

results obtained in these analyses revealed the common features of products repaired via HDR

pathways in plant somatic cells reported elsewhere in dicots (Butler et al., 2016; Čermák et al.,

254

2015; Dahan-Meir et al., 2018) and monocots (Gil-Humanes et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018),

255

regardless of whether a T-DNA or geminiviral replicon system was involved. More

256

importantly, 15 out of 16 events showed no amplification of circularized forms of the DNA

257

replicon, and even the replicon-carrying events lost this replicon after long-term growth in

258

greenhouse conditions (data not shown), indicating that these plants were free of the replicon

259

(Figure 3B). The absence of the replicon might be hypothetically explained by reverse

260

construction of the donor template (Figure 1B), leading to the opposite arrangement of the

261

LIR forward promoter sequence against a 35S promoter sequence (LIR-p35S orientation

262

interference), which triggers a silencing mechanism in plant cells in later stages. This

263

possibility was later supported by the appearance of replicons in the majority of plants

264

regenerated using other replicon systems without LIR-p35S orientation interference.

265

The HDR allele was stably inherited in offspring by self-pollination as well as backcrossing

266

To validate stable heritable edits, we grew genome-edited generation 1 (GE1) plants (Figure

267

3C) obtained from the self-pollination of LbCpf1-based HDR GE0 events and identified a

268

segregating population with a purple phenotype (Supplemental Table 8) similar to the

269

segregating profiles shown by Čermák and coworkers (2015). PCR analyses of the segregating

270

plants showed inheritance of the edited allele (Figure 3D and Supplemental Figure 9). The

271

offspring segregated from the #C1.4 event were analyzed in detail. Five dark purple plants

272

(C1.4.1-C1.4.5, homozygous for the ANT1 HDR-edited allele, Supplemental Figure 10), six

273

pale purple plants (C1.4.30-C1.4.35, heterozygous for the ANT1 HDR-edited allele,

274

Supplemental Figure 10), and two wild-type-like plants did not contain the HDR-edited allele,

275

as expected (Figure 3D, predicted results correlated with phenotypes). The dark purple plants

276

showed PCR amplification from the replaced allele but no amplification of the wild -type

277

allele when PCR was performed using primers flanking the editing site (Figure 1A). In

278

contrast, heterozygous and wild-type plants showed a band corresponding to the wild-type

279

allele. Further assessment indicated that the GE2 offspring of the homozygous GE1 plants

280

were all dark purple, and the back-crossed (to WT female as pollen acceptors) BC1F1

281

generation all showed the pale purple phenotype (Supplemental Figure 10), suggesting the

282

feasibility of recovering the parental genetic background via backcrossing in cases of

283

unexpected modification, including off-target effects. Sanger sequencing revealed perfect

284

inheritance of the HDR-edited allele from the GE0 generation of event C1.4 (Supplemental

285

Figure 11) to its homozygous offspring. We subsequently subjected gDNAs of several

286

putative homozygous as well as heterozygous GE1 lines to Southern blot analysis. The data

287

revealed and confirmed the existence and inheritance of the edited locus in GE1 lines as

288

shown at expected sizes at single HDR band (homozygote) or in combination of HDR and WT

289

bands (heterozygote) (Supplemental Figure 12; Data S5) These data also showed no

290

amplification of circular forms of the DNA replicon (Figure 3D and Supplemental Figure 10),

291

indicating that the GE1 plants were also free of the replicons.

293

To show the applicability of our HDR system to practical plant genome editing, we sought to

294

use it to edit a potentially agronomic trait, and salinity tolerance was chosen as the target trait.

295

High-affinity K+ Transporter 1;2 (HKT1;2) plays an important role in the maintenance of K+

296

uptake under salt stress (Ali et al., 2012). Salinity tolerance was determined by a single N/D

297

variant (N217D in tomato) in the pore region of HKT1;2, which determines selectivity for

298

Na+ and K+ (Ali et al., 2016). We succeeded in generating a heterozygous but perfect HDR

299

GE0 event to produce the salt-tolerant allele (N217D) (Ali et al., 2016) (Figure 4A,

300

Supplemental Table 9) according to the analysis of 150 events (~0.66%) using our system

301

with a HKT1;2 gene donor template that included neither an allele-associated antibiotic

302

selection marker nor an ANT1 color marker (Figure 4B; Data S1). The CRISPR/LbCpf1

303

system was very effective for NHEJ repair because it generated indel mutation rates of up to

304

72% in multiple mutation patterns decomposed by ICE Synthego software (Hsiau et al., 2019)

305

(Supplemental Figure 13A and B), in which most of the events resulted in 47-97% cells

306

carrying indel sequences (Supplemental Table 10). In comparison with the first report on the

307

allele-associated marker-free gene targeting of the CRTISO allele (Dahan-Meir et al., 2018),

308

the HDR frequency obtained with the HKT1;2 locus in this study was much lower, possibly

309

due to (1) lower cutting activity (note the indel mutation rates in Supplemental Table 10), (2)

310

a different target site context or (3) the use of a different strategy to express Rep/RepA

311

(Dahan-Meir and coworkers used a replicon tool with Rep expression driven by a CaMV35S

312

promoter from outside of LIR-SIR-LIR boundary), or to unknown reasons associated with the

313

CRTISO alleles, as claimed by the authors, or all of the above-mentioned factors. We used a

314

similar replicon tool to that reported by Dahan-Meir and coworkers (2018) for ANT1 targeting

315

via the HDR pathway in this study but obtained significantly lower HDR efficiencies than were

316

obtained with the pHR01 tool (data not shown).

317

The editing event involving the D217 allele resulted in a normal morphology (Figure 4C) and

318

normally set fruits (Supplemental Figure 14) compared to WT. It should be noted that the

319

mutated nucleotide (A to G) of HKT1;2 is not accessible by any currently known base editor

320

(BE), including xCas9-ABE (Hu et al., 2018), highlighting the significance of HDR-based

321

genome editing. We tested the self-pollinated GE1 generation of the plants obtained from the

322

event and observed up to 100 mM NaCl tolerance at the germination stage (Figure 5A) in both

323

homozygous and heterozygous plants. The salt-tolerant plants showed a 3-4-day delay in

324

germination compared to the mock controls but grew normally in NaCl-containing medium

325

(Figure 5A) and later fully recovered in soil (Figure 5B). Screening for the presence of HDR

326

allele(s) in the tested plants via the cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) method

327

showed allele segregation following Mendelian rules (Figure 5C). The true HKT1;2 N217D HDR

328

alleles in the GE1 plants were ultimately confirmed by Sanger sequencing. It is worth noting

329

that most of the elite alleles in plants do not associate with any selection marker, and hence, a

330

highly efficient HDR with allele-associated marker-free system is in high demand.

331

Thus, through the application of various approaches, our study showed a significant

332

improvement of HDR efficiency in tomato somatic cells. The HDR allele was stably inherited

333

in subsequent generations obtained via self-pollination and backcrossing. The advancement of

334

HDR in somatic cells, the generation of replicon-free HDR-edited plants in the GE0

335

generation and the invention of multi-replicon system open the door for practical applications

336

of the technique to improve crop traits, with special interest for asexually reproducing crops.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

338

Construction and cloning of HDR testing systems

339

The entire design principle and all cloning procedures followed MoClo (Weber et al., 2011)

340

and Golden Gate (Engler et al., 2014) protocols. pLSL.R.Ly was designed by amplifying the

341

long intergenic region (LIR), short intergenic region (SIR) and lycopene marker from the

342

pLSLR plasmid (Čermák et al., 2015) and was cloned following the order shown in

343

Supplemental Figure 3A and Data S1. Level 2 Golden Gate BpiI restriction sites flanking the

344

pink marker gene (lycopene) were also integrated within the replicon for the cloning of HDR

345

expression cassettes. The release of circularized DNA replicons was validated in tomato

346

leaves (Supplemental Figure 3B) as well as tomato cotyledon explants (data not shown). The

347

pTC147 and pTC217 plasmids ( Čermák et al., 2015) were obtained from Addgene and used as

348

a reference. The LbCpf1-based HDR replicons were designed and cloned similarly to the

349

SpCas9-based constructs, with two guide RNAs (LbCpf1_gRNA1 and LbCpf1_gRNA2,

350

Figure 1A; Data S1). Donor DNAs (ANT1D2) were constructed for the integration of an

351

antibiotic selection marker (NptII) and the insertion of a CaMV 35S promoter to drive

352

overexpression of the ANT1 gene (pANT1ox, Figure 1A; Data S1). The dual-guide RNA

353

construct was designed by multiplexing the LbCpf1 crRNAs as a tandem repeat of scaffold

354

RNA followed by 23 nt guide RNA sequences. The crRNAs were driven by an AtU6

355

promoter (Kamoun Lab, Addgene #46968) and terminated by 7-T chain sequences (Data S1).

356

Tomato transformation

357

Our study of HDR improvement was conducted using tomato (Hongkwang cultivar, a local

358

variety) as a model plant. All the binary vectors were transformed into Agrobacterium

16

359

tumefaciens GV3101 (pMP90) using electroporation. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation

360

was used to deliver editing tools to tomato cotyledon fragments (Supplemental Figure 15).

361

Explants for transformation were prepared from 7-day-old cotyledons. Sterilized seeds of the

362

Hongkwang cultivar were grown in MSO medium (half-strength MS medium containing 30

363

g/L of sucrose, pH 5.8) at 25±2ºC under 16 h/8 h light/dark conditions. Seven-day-old

364

seedlings were collected, and their cotyledonary leaves were sliced into 0.2-0.3 cm fragments.

365

The fragments (explants) were pretreated in PREMC medium [MS basal salts, Gamborg B5

366

vitamins, 2.0 mg/L of Zeatin trans isomer and 0.2 mg/L of indolyl acetic acid (IAA), 1 mM of

367

putrescine and 30 g/L of glucose, pH 5.7] for 1 day. The precultured explants were then

368

pricked and transformed using A. tumefaciens GV3101::pMP90 cells carrying HR construct(s).

369

A. tumefaciens GV3101::pMP90 cells were grown in primary culture overnight (LB

370

containing suitable antibiotics) in a shaking incubator at 30ºC. Agrobacteria were then

371

collected from the culture (OD 0.6-0.8) by centrifugation. The cells were resuspended in

372

liquid ABM-MS (pH 5.2) and 200 µM acetosyringone. Transformation was carried out for 25

373

min at RT. The explants were then transferred to cocultivation medium containing all of the

374

components in the ABM-MS medium and 200 µM acetosyringone, pH 5.8. The cocultivation

375

plates were kept in the darkness at 25ºC for 2 days, and the explants were then shifted to

376

nonselection medium (NSEL) for 5 days and subcultured in selection medium (SEL5). The

377

nonselection and selection media contained all of the components of the preculture medium as

378

well as 300 mg/L of timentin and 80 mg/L of kanamycin. Subculture of the explants was

379

carried out at 14-day intervals to achieve the best regeneration efficiency. Explants containing

380

purple calli or shoots were then transferred to SEL5R medium (similar to SEL5 but with the

381

zeatin trans isomer concentration reduced to 1.0 mg/L) for further regeneration and/or

382

elongation. When the shoots were sufficiently long (1.5-3.0 cm), they were transferred to

383

rooting medium (containing all of the components of the elongation medium the except zeatin

384

trans isomer plus 1.0 mg/L IBA) to generate intact plants. The intact plants from the rooting

385

medium were transferred to vermiculite pots to allow them to harden before shifting them to

386

soil pots in a greenhouse with a temperature of 26±2ºC under a 16 h/8 h photoperiod. The

387

experimental treatment of the physical conditions and data collection were conducted as

388

described in Supplemental Figure 15.

389

HDR efficiency calculation

390

In a previous report, the HDR efficiency calculated by dividing the number of explants

391

containing at least one purple callus (appearing as a purple spot) by the total number of explants

392

obtained from Agrobacterium-mediated transformation reached 12% with the replicon system

393

(Čermák et al., 2015). In the present study, purple spots were scored at 21-day post-

394

transformation and HDR efficiencies were calculated differently by normalization of the

395

purple spot numbers per cotyledon explant obtained using genome editing constructs to the

396

purple spot numbers per cotyledon explant counted in case of transformation of the SlANT1

397

overexpression cassette (pTC147 and pANT1 ox, Figure 1B) in the same conditions.

398

Plant genomic DNA isolation

399

Tomato genomic DNA isolation was performed using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen,

400

USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Approximately 200 mg of leaf tissue was

401

crushed in liquid nitrogen using a ceramic mortar and pestle and processed with the kit.

402

Genomic DNA was eluted from the mini spin column with 50-80 µl of TE or nuclease-free

403

water.

404

HDR event evaluation

405

The assessment of gene targeting junctions was performed by conventional PCR using

406

primers flanking the left (UPANT1-F1/NptII-R1) and right (ZY010F/TC140R (Čermák et al.,

407

2015) (Supplemental Table 6 and 7) junctions and a high-fidelity Taq DNA polymerase

408

(Phusion Taq, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and Sanger sequencing (Solgent, Korea). DNA

409

amplicons and related donor template levels were evaluated by semiquantitative PCR and

410

qPCR (using KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR Kits, Sigma-Aldrich, USA), respectively, using

411

primers specific to only circularized replicons and the donor template. Additionally, the qPCR

412

assays were designed and conducted following MIQE’s guidelines, with SlPDS

413

(Solyc03g123760) and SlEF1 (Solyc07g016150) as normalized controls. Analyses of the

414

inherited behavior of the HDR-edited allele were performed with genome-edited generation 1

415

(GE1) by PCR and Sanger sequencing. Circularized replicons were detected using PCR with

416

the corresponding primers for pHR01 (Supplemental Table 6), multi-replicons (Supplemental

417

Table 4) or pTC217 (Supplemental Table 7).

418

Statistical analyses

419

HDR efficiencies were recorded in at least three replicates and were statistically analyzed and

420

plotted using PRISM 7.01 software. In Figure 1C, multiple comparisons of the HDR

421

efficiencies of the other constructs with that of pRep - were performed by one-way ANOVA

422

(uncorrected Fisher LSD test, n=3, df=2, t=4.4; 4.4 and 1.5 for pTC217; pHR01 and pgRNA -,

423

respectively). In Figure 1E, pairwise comparisons of the HDR efficiencies of pTC217 and

424

pHR01 under the three lighting conditions were performed with Student’s t-test (DD: t=1.222,

425

df=4; 8 L/16 D: t=2.424, df=7 and 16 L/8 D: t=3.059, df=4). In Figure 1F, comparisons of the

426

HDR efficiencies of pTC217 and pHR01 in the various temperature conditions were

427

performed with Student’s t-test (19°C: t=2.656, df=2; 25°C: t=3.346, df=2; 28°C: t=2.099,

428

df=5; 31°C: t=4.551, df=2). In Figure 2B, comparisons of the HDR efficiencies of the other

429

multi-replicon tools with pHR01 were performed with Student’s test (MR01: t=3.648, df=3;

430

MR02: t=6.041, df=3; MR03: t=2.032, df=3; MR04: t=1.893, df=3).

adapted to HDR repair (Supplemental Figure 6A), but the left junction could not be amplified

744

(using the UPANT1-F1/NptII-R1 primer pair, Figure 1A). Sequencing of the left junction region

745

showed a ligation event between the RB of the T-DNA and the 3’ break in the upstream ANT1

Figure 1. HDR-based genome editing of the ANT1 locus.
(A) Representatives of ANT1 targeting sites and homologous DNA donor template construction. The upstream sequence of the ANT1 locus (middle panel)
was selected for targeting by HDR. The kanamycin expression cassette (pNOS-NptII-tOCS) and CaMV 35S promoter were designed to be inserted at a
position 142 bp upstream of the ANT1 start codon. The cutting sites of the two guide RNAs used in this study are indicated by two black arrows. The
sequences of the gRNAs are shown in the bottom panel. The red arrows show the relative binding sites and orientations of the primers used for analyses of
HDR events.
(B) T-DNA constructs used for HDR improvement experiments. The dual-guide RNA scaffold (2x1 gRNAANT1) was driven by the Arabidopsis U6 promoter core
element (75 bp). The LbCpf1 expression cassette was re-engineered to contain the Arabidopsis Ubiquitin 1 intron I downstream of the CaMV 35S promoter
and upstream of LbCpf1 and to be terminated by the CaMV 35S terminator (35S-LbCpf1I-t35S). Red and orange boxes indicate long intergenic regions (LIR)
and short intergenic regions (SIR) of geminivirus DNA, respectively. The black arrow indicates the relevant binding site and orientation of the RRA-R6 primer
for subsequent analyses. The red arrows show the orientation of the ANT1 donor templates (ANT1D2).
(C) Comparison of HDR efficiency between different constructs. Transformed tomato cotyledon fragments were incubated under continuous darkness at
28°C for the first 10 days after washing.
(D) Representative photographs of HDR-edited T0 events indicated by purple calli (red arrows) or direct HDR shoot formation (yellow arrow).

the T-DNA and the 3’ break in the upstream ANT1 promoter sequence via NHEJ. Red dotted line: ligation
boundary.

Supplemental Figure 12. Southern Blot analysis of the ANT1 edited locus. Genomic DNAs were isolated from the
leaves of the ANT1 HDR events and 20 µg of each gDNAs were digested with NsiI and resolved on 0.8% agrose gel.
The resolved DNAs were then blotted onto Hybond N+ membrane and later detected using Dioxigenin labeled Probe
(Supplemental Figure 2). The marker lane (M, DNA Molecular Weight Marker III, Digoxigenin-labeled, Roche) is
separated for better illustration of the image. The expected bands with sizes are denoted beside the Southern blot
panel. C1.4.4, C1.9.1, C1.10.2, C1.12.3: GE1 lines showed strong amplification of RJ and LJ in Supplemental Figure

 Method used for assessment of activity of the guide RNAs
 Decomposition of Sanger sequencing data using ICE Synthego software
Method: PCR products amplified using the primers (see table below) flanking the targeted sites of
SlANT1 in pHR01 (ID11 to ID121) and pTC217 (ID91 to ID920)-transformed events and WT were
purified on 0.8% agarose gel and subjected to Sanger sequencing and the sequencing data files (.ab1
extension) were decomposed using ICE Synthego (Hsiau et al., 2019). The WT sequencing ab1 file
was used as the reference sequence for assessment of any DNA modification at the flanking site of
that of the ANT1 events (Figure A and B). The results are summarized in Table A and B.

 Decomposition of Sanger sequencing data using ICE Synthego software
Method: PCR products (only single band at the expected size was observed) amplified using the
primers with the ANT1 HDR events #C11; C12; C13; C141; C142; C18; C19; C110; C111; C112; C113;
C114; C115; C116; C117 and WT were purified on 0.8% agarose gel and subjected to Sanger
sequencing and the sequencing data files (.ab1 extension) were decomposed using ICE Synthego
(Hsiau et al., 2019). The WT sequencing ab1 file was used as the reference sequence for assessment
of any DNA modification at the flanking site of that of the ANT1 HDR events.
No off-targeted modification was found at both the potential off-target sites in all the tested
samples:

 qRT-PCR procedure and analysis of data
All of the qPCR and qRT-PCR analyses were performed following the MIQE guideline (Bustin et al.,
2009). Briefly total RNAs were isolated from plant tissues using RNeasy mini Qiagen kits (cat. no.
74104, Qiagen, USA) and subjected to reverse transcription for synthesizing 1st cDNA strands using
QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit and protocol (cat. no. 205311, Qiagen, USA). At least two pairs
of primers were tested for each target gene/cDNA for evaluating their efficiencies and primers pairs
with ~ 100% efficiency were ultimately used for qPCR/qRT-PCR. The similar assessment was also
applied for the internal genes for normalizing the amplicon levels. qPCR/qRT-PCRs were performed
using intercalating dyes (KAPA SYBR FAST Universal, cat. No. KK4601, Sigma, USA) for detecting
products. Thermocycling was conducted with Illumina Eco Real-Time PCR System (Illumina, USA).
Analyses of amplicon levels were performed using delta delta Cq method (Livak and Schmittgen,
2001) with internal gene/transcript of SlPDS and were plotted using Excel software (Microsoft, USA).
 SlRAD51 or SlRAD54 transcript levels expressed in transgenic pMR03 or pMR04 events, respectively. pMR02
samples were used as references.

Southern analysis for ANT1 HDR GE1 plants
The Southern blot technique was implemented using MSU Potato Lab's protocol
(https:/msu.edu/course/css/451/LabProtocols/09SOUTHERNprocedit.pdf) with minor modification.
Essentially, genomic DNAs (gDNAs) are isolated from tomato leaves using DNeasy Plant Maxi Kit (cat.
no. 68163, Qiagen, Gemany). Approximately 800 µl of gDNA was eluted from column and subjected
to precipitation by adding 2.5 volume of absolute ethanol and 1/30 volume of sodium acetate 3M,
incubating at -80oC for 2h, centrifuging at 13rpm for 20 minutes and drying for 30 minutes in a 37oC
incubator to completely remove residual ethanol. The final eluted volume was 60 µl of AE buffer
with ~500-1000 ng/µl.
Twenty micrograms of the gDNAs was digested overnight (~18 h) at 37oC with NsiI (NEB, USA) and
inactivated at 65oC for 20 minutes. The digested product was precipitated by adding 2.5 volume of
absolute ethanol and 1/30 volume of sodium acetate 3M, incubating at -80oC for 2h, centrifuging at
13rpm for 20 minutes and drying for 30 minutes in a 37oC incubator to completely remove residual
ethanol. The dried DNA was suspended in 30 ul of EB buffer and 6 ul of DNA loading dye 6x was
added for agarose gel running. The digested product was loaded in a 0.8% agarose gel and resolved
by running overnight (~18h) at low voltage (30V). Resolved DNA bands were overnight transferred
onto a Hybond N+ membrane (GE Healthcare, USA) by capillary transferring system. The blotted
membrane was treated two times with high energy UV (1200x100 µJ/cm2) for crosslinking the DNAs
to the membrane.
The membrane was then pre-hybridized and overnight hybridized with DIG-labeled Probe specific
for the downstream homologous arm (Supplemental Figure 2) in a plastic bag. The probe was
amplified by PCR using primers flanking the downstream homologous arm (see ptimer table below).
Probes were DIG-labeled by random priming using a Random Primed DNA Labeling Kit (cat.no.
11004760001, Roche, Switzerland) following the manufacture’s protocol. The probed membrane
was washed stringently and bound DIG probe was detected using DIG Nucleic Acid Detection Kit
(cat.no. 11175041910, Roche, Switzerland) following the manufacture’s protocol. Below are details
of each part conducted in the analysis.

Place the solution in a 65oC water bath for 15min. The flashpoint of pure formamide is 68oC
therefore do not boil the solution.)
- Do not let blot dry in the bag. Immediately add the hybridization solution and place in
hybridization oven. Make sure the tube is balanced! Incubate overnight at 37oC.
 DETECTION
- After hybridization and stringency washes, rinse membrane briefly with WASHING BUFFER
about 2-5 min in a plastic tray with the DNA side up.
- Incubate membrane in 100mls of BUFFER 2 for 30 min.
- Dilute anti-DIG-AP conjugate 150 mU/ml (1:5,000 dilution) =10ul in 50ml of fresh BUFFER 2.
- Incubate membrane for 30 min in the antibody solution on shaker either in a plastic tray. Ensure
that the solution is covering the entire blot with gentle agitation (30rpm).
- In a plastic tray wash the membrane 2X 15 min. with 100ml of WASHING BUFFER. Apply gentle
agitation (30rpm).
- Equilibrate membrane 2-5 min. in 20 ml BUFFER 3.
- Add 400 μl of NBT/BCIP stock solution (vial 4) to 20 ml of Detection buffer. Note: Store
protected from light!
- Add the solution to the membrane for color development and keep in dark up to 16h.
