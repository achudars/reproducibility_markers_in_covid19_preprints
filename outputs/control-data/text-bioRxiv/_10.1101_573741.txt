Abstract

13

Evolutionary changes in developmental gene expression lead to alteration in the embryonic body

14

plan and biodiversity. A promising approach for linking changes in developmental gene

15

expression to altered morphogenesis is the comparison of developmental transcriptomes of

16

closely related and further diverged species within the same phylum. Here we generated

17

quantitative transcriptomes of the sea star, Patiria miniata (P. miniata) of the echinoderm

18

phylum, at eight embryonic stages. We then compared developmental gene expression

19

between P. miniata and the sea urchin, Paracentrotus lividus (~500 million year divergence) and

20

between Paracentrotus lividus and the sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (~40 million

21

year divergence). We discovered that the interspecies correlations of gene expression level

22

between morphologically equivalent stages decreases with increasing evolutionary distance, and

23

becomes more similar to the correlations between morphologically distinct stages. This trend is

24

observed for different sub-sets of genes, from various functional classes and embryonic

25

territories, but is least severe for developmental genes sub-sets. The interspecies correlation

26

matrices of developmental genes show a consistent peak at the onset of gastrulation, supporting

27

the hourglass model of phylotypic stage conservation. We propose that at large evolutionary

28

distance the conservation of relative expression levels for most sets of genes is more related to the

29

required quantities of transcripts in a cell than to conserved morphogenesis processes. In these

30

distances, the information about morphological similarity is reflected mostly in the interspecies

31

correlations between the expressions of developmental control genes.

Author summary

34

Understanding the relationship between the interspecies conservation of gene expression and

35

morphological similarity is a major challenge in modern evolutionary and developmental biology.

36

The Interspecies correlations of gene expression levels have been used extensively to illuminate

37

these relationships and reveal the developmental stages that show the highest conservation of

38

gene expression, focusing on the diagonal elements of the correlation matrices. Here we

39

generated the developmental transcriptomes of the sea star, Patiria miniata, and used them to

40

study the interspecies correlations between closely related and further diverged species within the

41

echinoderm phylum. Our study reveals that the diagonal elements of the correlation matrices

42

contain only partial information. The off-diagonal elements, that compare gene expression

43

between distinct developmental stages, indicate whether the conservation of gene expression is

44

indeed related to similar morphology or instead, to general cellular constraints that linger

45

throughout development. With increasing evolutionary distances the diagonal elements decrease

46

and become similar to the off-diagonal elements, reflecting the shift from morphological to

47

general cellular constraints. Within this trend, the interspecies correlations of developmental

48

control genes maintain their diagonality even at large evolutionary distance, and peak at the onset

49

of gastrulation, supporting the hourglass model of phylotypic stage conservation.

Introduction

51

Embryo development is controlled by regulatory programs encoded in the genome that are

52

executed during embryogenesis, which usually last days to months [1]. Genetic changes in these

53

programs that occur in evolutionary time scales - millions to hundreds of million years - lead to

54

alterations in body plans and ultimately, biodiversity [1]. Comparing developmental gene

55

expression between diverse species can illuminate evolutionary conservation and modification in

56

these programs that underlie morphological conservation and divergence. To understand how

57

these programs change with increasing evolutionary distances it is important to study closely

58

related and further divergent species within the same phylum.

59

The echinoderm phylum provides an excellent system for comparative studies of developmental

60

gene expression dynamics. Echinoderms have two types of feeding larvae: the pluteus-like larvae

61

of sea urchins and brittle stars, and the auricularia-like larvae of sea cucumbers and sea stars [2].

62

Of these, the sea urchin and the sea star had been extensively studied both for their

63

embryogenesis and their gene regulatory networks [3-11]. Sea urchins and sea stars diverged

64

from their common ancestor about 500 million years ago, yet their endoderm lineage and the gut

65

morphology show high similarity between their embryos [6]. On the other hand, the mesodermal

66

lineage diverged to generate novel cell types in the sea urchin embryo (Fig. 1A, [8, 12]).

67

Specifically, the skeletogenic mesoderm lineage, which generates the larval skeletal rods that

68

underlie the sea urchin pluteus morphology, and the mesodermal pigment cells that give the sea

69

urchin larva its red pigmentation (arrow and arrowheads in Fig. 1A). Thus, there are both

70

morphological similarities and differences between sea urchin and sea star larval body plans that

71

make these classes very interesting for comparative genetic studies.

72

The models of the gene regulatory networks that control the development of the sea urchin and

73

those that control cell fate specification in the sea star are the state of the art in the field [3-11].

74

The endodermal and ectodermal gene regulatory networks show high levels of conservation

75

between the sea urchin and the sea star in agreement with the overall conserved morphology of

76

these two germ layers [6, 9, 11]. Surprisingly, most of the transcription factors active in the

77

skeletogenic and the pigment mesodermal lineages are also expressed in the sea star mesoderm

78

[7, 8]. Furthermore, the expression dynamics of key endodermal, mesodermal and ectodermal

79

regulatory genes were compared between the Mediterranean sea urchin, Paracentrotus lividus (P.

80

lividus) and the sea star, Patiria miniata (P. miniata) [13]. Despite the evolutionary divergence of

81

these two species, an impressive level of conservation of regulatory gene expression in all the

82

embryonic territories was observed. This could suggest that novel mesodermal lineages diverged

83

from an ancestral mesoderm through only a few regulatory changes that drove major changes in

84

downstream gene expression and embryonic morphology [7, 8].

85

Insight on the genome-wide changes in developmental gene expression can be gained from

86

comparative transcriptome studies of related species at equivalent developmental stages [14-17].

87

We previously investigated different aspects of interspecies conservation of gene expression

88

between P. lividus and the pacific sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (S. purpuratus) [16,

89

17]. These species diverged from their common ancestor about 40 million years ago and have a

90

highly similar embryonic morphology (Fig. 1A). We observed high conservation of gene

91

expression dynamics of both developmental genes (expressed differentially and regulate specific

92

embryonic lineages) and housekeeping genes (expressed in all the cells throughout developmental

93

time) [17]. Yet, the interspecies correlations of the expression levels of these two sets of genes

94

show distinct behaviors.

95

The interspecies correlations of the expression levels of developmental genes are high between

96

morphologically similar stages in the two sea urchins, and decrease sharply between diverse

97

developmental stages, resulting with highly diagonal correlation matrices [17]. The correlations

98

peak at mid-development, at the onset of gastrulation, in agreement with the hourglass model of

99

developmental conservation [17-19]. Conversely, the interspecies correlations of housekeeping

100

gene expression increase with developmental time and are high between all post-hatching time

101

points, resulting with distinct off-diagonal elements of the correlation matrix [17]. This indicates

102

that the ratio between the expression levels of sets of housekeeping genes is conserved and

103

maintained

104

Interestingly, another situation where the interspecies correlation matrix is not diagonal was

105

observed for highly diverged species that belong to different phyla [20]. In these large

106

evolutionary distances, the interspecies correlation has an opposite hourglass behavior with high

107

correlations between all early time points and between all late time points [20]. This suggests that

108

the off-diagonal elements of the interspecies correlation matrix might contain information about

109

the relationship between the conservation of gene expression and the conservation of

110

morphology.

111

Apparent differences in the conservation patterns between developmental and housekeeping

112

genes were observed in other studies of closely related species [18] and were a reason to exclude

113

housekeeping genes from comparative studies of developing embryos [19]. Yet, embryogenesis

114

progression depends on the dynamic expression of housekeeping genes that is highly conserved

115

between closely related species [17]. Here we aim to decipher how the patterns of gene-

116

expression conservation change between closely to distantly related species using the sea star and

117

the sea urchin as our model systems. To this end, we generated and analyzed de-novo

118

developmental quantitative transcriptomes of the sea star, P. miniata, and compared them with

119

the published developmental transcriptomes of P. lividus [17] and S. purpuratus [21] at

120

equivalent developmental stages (Fig. 1B). Our studies illuminate how the interspecies

121

conservation of gene expression levels for different functional classes and cell lineages change

122

with evolutionary distance.

131

profiles of selected regulatory genes show mild heterochronies and overall similarity between P.

132

miniata (RNA-seq, current study) and the sea urchin species, S. purpuratus (nanostring, [23]) and

P. lividus (RNA-seq, [17]), in agreement with our previous study (Fig. 1C, [12]).

134

Identification of 1:1:1 orthologues gene set and quantitative data access

135

To compare developmental gene expression between the sea star, P. miniata, and the two sea

136

urchins, P. lividus and S. purpuratus we identified 8735 1:1:1 putative homologous genes, as

137

described in the Materials and Methods section. Quantification and annotations of all these

138

homologous genes in P. miniata, P. lividus and in S. purpuratus are provided in Table S3 (based

139

on [17] for P. lividus and on [21, 22] for S. purpuratus). Within this set, 6593 genes were

140

expressed in the three species, 1093 genes are expressed only in the two sea urchin species, 187

141

genes were expressed only in the sea star, P. miniata, and the sea urchin, S. purpuratus, and 430

142

genes are expressed only in P. miniata and P. lividus (Fig. 2A). We looked for enrichment of

143

gene ontology (GO) terms within these different gene sets but did not identify enrichment of

144

specific developmental processes (GOseq [24] with S. purpuratus annotations, Fig. S1 and Table

145

S4).

146

We uploaded the data of the 1:1:1 homologous genes expressed in the three species to Echinobase

147

where they are available through gene search at www.echinobase.org/shiny/quantdevPm [25]. In

148

this Shiny web application [26], genes can be searched either by their name or by their P. miniata,

149

S. purpuratus or P. lividus transcript identification number. The application returns our

150

quantitative measurements of gene expression for each stage of P. miniata, plots of transcript

151

expression level, mRNA sequences, a link to the corresponding records in Echinobase [27] and

152

links to the loci in the S. purpuratus and P. miniata genome browsers. This will hopefully be a

153

useful resource for the community. Further analyses of the 6593 1:1:1 homologous genes

154

expressed in all three species are described below.

163

are relatively distinct (orange track). This is in agreement with the relative evolutionary distances

164

between the three species (Fig. 1A). However, the developmental progression in all three species

165

is along a similar trajectory in the NMDS two dimensional space, which probably reflects the

166

resemblance in the overall morphology between these three echinoderm species. Overall, the

167

NMDS indicates that major sources of variation in these data sets are developmental progression

168

and evolutionary distance.

169

Interspecies correlations decrease and the pattern becomes less diagonal with

170

evolutionary distance

171

We wanted to study how the pattern of the interspecies correlations of gene expression changes

172

with evolutionary distance for different classes of genes. To be able to compare the interspecies

173

correlations between the three species we included only time points that had data for all species.

174

Explicitly, we excluded P. lividus 4hpf and P. miniata 9hpf that do not have an equivalent time

175

point in the S. purpuratus data. We calculated the Pearson correlations of gene expression levels

176

between P. lividus and S. purpuratus and between P. lividus and P. miniata for subsets of

177

homologous genes with specific developmental, housekeeping or metabolic function, according

178

to their GO terms (Fig. 3). As expected, the interspecies correlation patterns differ in strength and

179

diagonality between different functional classes for both Pl-Sp and Pl-Pm comparison.

180

For a better assessment of the correlation pattern we sought to quantify these two distinct

181

properties: the correlation strength between equivalent developmental stages and the diagonality

182

of the matrix. As a measure of the correlation strength between morphologically similar time

183

points, we defined the parameter AC = Average Correlation, which is the average of the

184

diagonal elements of the correlation matrix. That is, AC=1 corresponds to perfect correlation

185

throughout all equivalent developmental stages and AC=0 corresponds to no correlation.

186

Evidently, AC is not a measure of the diagonality of the matrix as it doesn’t consider the off-

187

diagonal terms. To quantify the diagonality of the correlation matrices we used a statistical test

188

we developed before to assess whether the interspecies correlation pattern is significantly close to

189

a diagonal matrix [17]. Briefly, the parameter, matrix diagonality (MD), indicates how many

190

times within 100 subsamples of the tested set of genes, the interspecies correlation matrix

191

was significantly close to a diagonal matrix compared to a random matrix. Hence, MD=100

192

is the highest diagonality score and 0 is the lowest (see materials and methods and [17] for

193

explanation, and Table S5 for results. MD is equivalent to ‘count significant’, or CS, in [17]).

194

Importantly, AC will be high for any matrix that has high diagonal elements, but MD will be high

195

only when the off-diagonal matrix elements are much lower than the diagonal, and low otherwise.

196

We ordered the correlation matrices according to their MD value in Sp-Pl, from the most diagonal

197

(Cell differentiation, MD=99) to the least (RNA processing, MD=17). This ordering clearly

198

demonstrates the high diagonality of the developmental genes (Fig. 3A-C) vs. the block patterns

199

of the housekeeping genes (Fig. 3G-J) and how the diagonality of the correlation pattern of all

200

genes combined is in between (Fig. 3F). Both the average correlation and the matrix diagonality

201

are lower between the sea urchin and the sea star than between the two sea urchins, that is, both

202

parameters decrease with evolutionary distance (compare bottom to upper panels in Fig. 3A-I).

203

Low correlation matrix diagonality indicates that the off-diagonal elements have a similar

204

strength to the diagonal elements. This means that the relationship between the expression levels

205

of a set of genes is maintained not only between morphologically similar developmental stages,

206

but throughout development. In the case of housekeeping genes that form complex structures, like

207

ribosomal proteins, this could be explained by stoichiometric ratio requirements between different

208

proteins that form the structure. With increasing evolutionary distance and morphological

209

divergence there is a reduction in matrix diagonality for all sets of genes (Fig. 3). Possibly, the

210

dominant constraints in large evolutionary distances are the cellular requirement for different

211

levels of transcripts that have different functions. These constraints are cellular and not related to

212

specific morphogenetic processes, which might explain the even correlation strength between

213

different developmental stages and hence, the lower diagonality at large evolutionary distances.

214

The interspecies correlation vary between different cell lineages

215

Our analysis is based on RNA-seq on whole embryos, yet we wanted to see if gene sets enriched

216

in a specific cell lineage show a difference in their interspecies correlation pattern. In a previous

217

work conducted in the sea urchin S. purpuratus embryos, the cells of six distinct embryonic

218

lineages were isolated based on cell-specific GFP reporter expression. Gene expression levels in

219

the isolated cells were studied and compared to gene expression levels in the rest of the embryo

220

by RNA-seq [28]. This analysis identified genes that their expression is enriched in the specific

221

lineages at the time when the isolation was done [28]. We calculated the Pearson interspecies

222

correlations for the subsets of genes enriched in each of the six sea urchin lineages, between the

223

two sea urchins and between the Mediterranean sea urchin and the sea star (Fig. 4). The sea

224

urchin cell lineages at the time of cell isolation are illustrated above the correlation patterns and

225

the developmental stage is indicated as a black square within the Pl-Sp correlation matrices.

226

Both the matrix diagonality and average correlation strength vary between the different cell types

227

and decrease with evolutionary distance. Interestingly, the genes enriched in sea urchin pigment

228

cells, a lineage that is lacking in the sea star, show similar Pl-Pm average correlation strength

229

compared to the matrices of the conserved lineages between the sea urchin and the sea star (Pl-Sp

230

AC=0.64 and Pl-Pm AC=0.5, Fig. 4B). As mentioned above, the regulatory state in the

231

mesoderm of the sea star and the sea urchin are quite similar [7]. Possibly, there is also similarity

232

in the downstream genes active in sea star blastocoelar cells and sea urchin pigment cells, as both

233

lineages have hematopoietic function [29]. On the other hand, the sharpest decrease in Pl-Pm

234

average correlation strength compared to Pl-Sp is for the genes enriched in the sea urchin

235

skeletogenic cells, another lineage that is absent in the sea star (Pl-Sp AC=0.71 while Pl-Pm

236

AC=0.4, Fig. 4C). Interestingly, the Pl-Pm matrix diagonality of these genes is comparable to the

237

Pl-Pm matrix diagonality of the conserved lineages (Pl-Pm MD=0.33, Fig. 4C). It is important to

238

note that key sea urchin skeletogenic matrix proteins were not found in the sea star skeleton [30]

239

and the genes encoding them were not found in the sea star genome. Therefore these key

240

skeletogenic genes are missing from our 1:1:1 homologous genes that include only genes that are

241

common to the three species. Thus, we are probably underestimating the differences in

242

skeletogenic and mesodermal gene expression between the sea urchin and the sea star, which

243

might explain the relatively high diagonality for the skeletogenic gene correlation matrix. Overall,

244

genes enriched in different cells lineages differ in their correlation pattern even between the

245

closely related sea urchins and show distinct differences in the correlation pattern with

246

evolutionary distance.

247
248

Matrix diagonality and correlation strength describe different properties of gene
expression conservation

249

Both the average correlation strength and the matrix diagonality depend on gene function, cell

250

lineage and decrease with evolutionary distance (Figs. 3, 4). When we plot, separately, the

251

average correlation and the matrix diagonality for different GO terms and cell lineages, in

252

decreasing strength in Pl-Pm we see two distinct orders (Fig. 5A and B). While the matrix

253

diagonality separates clearly the developmental genes with high diagonality from the

254

housekeeping genes with low diagonality, the average correlation does not show this distinction

255

(Fig. 5A, B). Moreover, the matrix diagonality and the average correlation strength change

256

independently of each other in both Pl-Sp and Pl-Pm correlation matrices (Fig. 5C). On the other

257

hand, the average correlations in Pl-Sp matrices seem to correspond to the average correlation in

258

Pl-Pm (Fig. 5D), and the same is true for the matrix diagonality (Fig. 5E).

259

These analyses imply that these two parameters describe different properties of the conservation

260

in gene expression, as we illustrate in Fig. 6. Apparently, the average correlation strength is a

261

measure of the conservation in gene expression levels: the higher it is, the more the gene-set is

262

constrained against expression change. The matrix diagonality on the other hand, seems to reflect

263

the link between the expression of a gene-set and morphological conservation: the more diagonal

264

is the correlation pattern of a gene set, the more related is the gene expression conservation within

265

the set to morphological similarity (Fig. 6). For example, the correlation matrices of transcription

266

factors and cell differentiation genes show strong correlations and high diagonality even between

267

the sea urchin and the sea star (Relatively high AC and MD, Fig. 3A,B, 6). Conversely, ribosomal

268

gene expression is highly conserved (high AC) but this conservation is not related to

269

morphological conservation (Low MD, Fig. 3I, 5A,B, 6). Overall, the average correlation strength

270

and matrix diagonality seem to carry complementary information about the relationship between

271

the conservation of gene expression and morphological conservation at varying evolutionary

272

distances (Fig. 6).

273

Discussion

274

In this paper we generated the developmental transcriptomes of the pacific sea star, P. miniata,

275

and studied them in comparison with the published developmental transcriptomes of two sea

276

urchin species, P. lividus [17] and S. purpuratus [21]. We generated a web application where the

277

P. miniata time courses and sequences can be publically viewed to facilitate the common use of

278

this data [25]. We studied the interspecies correlation patterns of different gene sets including,

279

housekeeping, developmental and metabolic genes (Fig. 3), as well as genes that are enriched in a

280

specific cell lineage in the sea urchin embryo (Fig. 4). We defined two parameters that describe

281

different properties of the conservation strength: the average correlation strength in the diagonal,

282

AC, and the matrix diagonality, MD. We noticed that these parameters vary independently

283

between different functional groups and cell types and decrease with evolutionary distance,

284

possibly reflecting different constraints on gene expression (Fig. 5). The correlation strength is an

285

indication of the evolutionary constraint on gene expression level while the matrix diagonality

286

seems to reflect the relationship between the gene set and morphological similarity. As we

287

suggested previously, parallel embryonic transcriptional programs might be responsible for

288

different aspects of embryo development and evolve under distinct constraint [17], as can be

289

inferred from analyzing these two parameters.

290

Previous studies have shown that housekeeping genes and tissue specific genes have different

291

chromatin structures [31] and distinct core promoters [32]. Furthermore, Enhancers of

292

developmental genes were shown to be de-methylated during the vertebrates’ phylotypic period,

293

suggesting another unique epigenetic regulation of this set of genes [33]. These epigenetic and

294

cis-regulatory differences could underlie the separation of the regulation of developmental and

295

housekeeping gene expression, leading to dissimilar evolutionary conservation patterns of these

296

two functionally distinct gene sets.

297

We observed a clear reduction of the matrix diagonality with increasing evolutionary distance for

298

all sets of genes, including developmental genes and transcription factors (Fig. 3-6). This is in

agreement with the morphological divergence between the sea urchin and the sea star. As

300

mentioned above, a recent study had shown that the correlation matrices for all homologous

301

genes between 10 different phyla are strictly not-diagonal [20]. At this large evolutionary distance

302

and extreme morphological divergence the only constraint that remains seem to be the cellular

303

requirements for differential transcript abundance, which are unrelated to morphological

304

similarity. Therefore the opposite hourglass pattern found for the diagonal elements of the

305

interspecies correlation matrices might not be indicative for morphological divergence at the

306

phylotypic stage. Overall, to better estimate the relationship between the conservation of gene

307

expression levels to morphological conservation, both correlation strength and correlation matrix

308

diagonality should be assessed and the focus should be on developmental control genes.

Materials and Methods

310

Sea star embryo cultures and RNA extraction

311

Adult P. miniata sea stars were obtained in Long Beach, California, from Peter Halmay. Embryos

312

were cultured at 15°C in artificial sea water. Total RNA was extracted using Qiagen mini RNeasy

313

kit from thousands of embryos. RNA samples were collected from eight embryonic stages, from

314

fertilized egg to late gastrula stage (Fig. 1B). For each embryonic stage, three biological

315

replicates from three different sets of parents were processed, except for the last time point for

316

which only two biological replicates were samples (23 samples in all). To match P. miniata time

317

points to those of the published S. purpuratus and P. lividus transcriptomes [17, 22] we used the

318

linear ratio between the developmental rates of these species found in [12, 34]. The corresponding

319

time points in both species are presented in Fig. 1B. The time points, 9 hour post fertilization

320

(hpf) in P. miniata and 4hpf in P. lividus do not have a comparable time point in S. purpuratus

321

data. RNA quantity was measured by nanodrop and quality was verified using bioanalyzer.

326

was purified from 500 ng of total RNA per developmental time point following by fragmentation

327

and generation of double stranded cDNA. Then, end repair, A base addition, adapter ligation and

328

PCR amplification steps were performed. Libraries were evaluated by Qubit and TapeStation.

329

Sequencing libraries were constructed with barcodes to allow multiplexing of 47 samples in one

330

lane. On average, 20 million single-end 60-bp reads were sequenced per sample on Illumina

331

HiSeq 2500 V4 using four lanes.

332

RNA-Seq datasets used: Four datasets were used: (1) newly sequenced P. miniata Single End

333

(SE) reads of 23 transcriptome samples generated as explained above; (2) publically available

334

Paired End (PE) reads of P. miniata from different developmental stages, testis and ovaries,

335

accessions: SRR6054712, SRR5986254, SRR2454338, SRR1138705, SRR573705-SRR573710

336

and SRR573675; (3) publically available SE reads of P. lividus transcriptome samples from eight

337

developmental stages (NCBI project PRJNA375820, [17]) ; (4) publically available PE reads of

338

seven S. purpuratus transcriptome samples (NCBI project PRJNA81157, [22]).

339

RNA-seq quality filtering: RNA-Seq reads from the above datasets were adapter-trimmed using

340

cutadapt 1.15 (https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io), then low-quality regions were removed with

341

Trimmomatic

342

(www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk).

343

P. miniata transcriptome assembly While P. miniata genome based gene predictions are

344

available for genome assembly v.2 (echinobase.org/Echinobase), many gene sequences are

345

fragmented or duplicated within the genome, and therefore we decided to generate a reference

346

transcriptome de-novo. Accordingly, P. miniata RNA-Seq reads, based on the available PE and

347

SE data, were assembled using Trinity 2.4 [36, 37] with the same Trinity parameters as before we

348

used for P. lividus in [17]. Trinity produced 1,610,829 contigs (the Trinity equivalent of

349

transcripts), within 679,326 Trinity gene groups. Transciptome completeness was tested using

350

BUSCO [38], and by comparing the contigs to genome-based protein annotations P. miniata v.2.0

351

and S. purpuratus v.3.1 (WHL22), (echinobase.org/Echinobase).

352

P. miniata data availability: Illumina short read sequences generated in this study was submitted

353

to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra), under bio-project

354

PRJNA522463

355

SRR8580044 - SRR8580066, assembled P. miniara transcriptome accession: SAMN10967027.

356

Transcriptome homology: We searched for homologous genes in the P. miniata transcriptome,

357

P. lividus transcriptome, S. purpuratus genome. Since the S. purpuratus genome-based gene

358

predictions dataset currently includes the most non-redundant and complete data among the three

359

datasets, it was used as a reference dataset. Accordingly, the largest isoforms of new P. miniata

360

transcriptome (see below), and the publicly available P. lividus transcriptome [17], were both

361

compare to the S.purpuratus genome-based predicted protein annotations (Echinobase v.3.1),

362

using CRB-BLAST [39]. CRB-BLAST reports relationships of 1:1 (Reciprocal hits), and 2:1

363

matches (when Blastx and tBlastn results are not reciprocal), where only matches with e-values

364

below a conditional threshold are reported. From the 2:1 cases, we selected the query-target pair

365

with the lowest e-value. Using CRB-BLAST, 11,291 and 12,720 P. miniata and P. lividus Trinity

366

genes, were identified as homologous to S. purpuratus proteins, respectively. We considered P.

367

miniata and P. lividus query genes that share the same S. purpuratus target gene, as homologous.

368

As the gene expression analysis shows (see next sections), 8,735 homologous genes are expressed

369

in at least one of the three tested species during development, and 6,593 are expressed in all the

370

three.

371

Gene-level transcripts abundance: For P. miniata and P. lividus transcriptomes, transcripts

372

abundance was estimated using kallisto-0.44.0 [40], and a further quantification at the gene-level,

373

and read-count level, was done using tximport [41] on R3.4.2. Expression analysis at read-count

374

level was conducted at gene-level in Deseq2 [42]. S. purpuratus PE reads, of 7 developmental

375

samples were mapped to the S. Purpuratus 3.1 genome assembly, using STAR v2.4.2a [43],

376

quantitated in Htseq-count v2.7 [44], and analyzed in Deseq2 at read-count level. For P. miniata

377

data, only contigs mapped to the Echinobase v.2 P. miniata proteins were considered. Prior to

378

DEseq2 read count standard normalization and expression analysis, genes with <1 CPM (Count

379

Per Million) were removed. Overall, most input reads were mapped and quantified, as further

380

detailed in Table S1. Samples were clustered using Non-metric multi-dimentional scaling

381

(NMDS) ordination in Vegan (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vegan/index.html), based

382

on log10 transformed FPKM values, and Bray-Curtis distances between samples. Since the

383

NMDS results indicate that all P. miniata and P. lividus samples are affected by the ‘batch’ factor

384

(see Table S1), we removed the estimated effect of this factor on FPKMs (Fragment per Kilobase

385

Million) values using “removeBatchEffect” function in EdgeR [45], in order to obtain corrected

386

FPKM values. Quantification and annotations of 34,307 identified P. miniata transcripts with

387

FPKM>3 in at least one time point, are provided in Table S2. NMDS analysis of the biological

388

replicates of all time points in P. miniata show that similar time points at different biological

389

replicate map together indicating high reproducibility of our gene expression analysis (Fig. S2).

390

Comparison between our RNA-seq quantification of gene expression and previous QPCR

391

quantification [12] for a sub-set of genes show high agreement between the two measurements

purpuratus 1:1:1 homologous genes are provided in Table S3 and are publicly available through

394

gene search in Ehinobase at www.echinobase.org/shiny/quantdevPm.

395

Gene Ontology functional enrichment analysis: Functional enrichment analysis was conducted

396

using TopGo in R3.4.2 (bioconductor.org). A custom GOseq GO database was built using the

397

publically

398

(http://www.echinobase.org/Echinobase/rnaseq/download/blast2go-whl.annot.txt.gz).

399

Pearson correlations for subsets of genes: The interspecies Pearson correlations for different

400

sets of genes presented in Figs. 3 and 4 were calculated using R3.4.2. For the analysis in Fig. 4,

401

we selected genes that have 1:1:1 homologs in P. miniata and P. lividus to the S. purpuratus

402

genes that are enriched in a specific S. purpuratus cell lineage with p-value<0.05, based on [28].

403

Cross species analysis of matrix diagonality (MD): We used a statistical test described in

404

detail in [17]. Shorty, the main goal of this procedure is to test the probability that a set of

405

homologous genes from two species, S1 and S2, show the most similar expression patterns in

406

equivalent developmental times, namely: is the interspecies correlation pattern significantly close

407

to a diagonal matrix? Here, S1 and S2 represent P. miniata vs. P. lividus, or P. lividus vs. S.

408

purpuratus. This test was conducted using all homologous genes, and for specific subsets of

409

genes belonging to specific GO categories as well as for genes enriched in specific cell lineage

410

[28]. Here, only samples from the n=5 late embryonic stages were used, and the mean of FPKM

411

values of all samples belonging to the same stages were taken. First, ns1 by ns2 matrix of Pearson

412

correlations, C, was produced, where ns1 by ns2 are the number of time point measurements in

413

each species (here ns1=ns2=5). Each of the C matrix positions, Cij, represents a Pearson’s

414

correlation value calculated based on ng FPKM values, between stage i in one species and stage j

415

in the other, where ng is the count of homologous gene pairs tested. Next, the C matrix was

416

compared to an “ideal” time-dependent correlation matrix I, in which a correlation of 1 exists

417

along the diagonal line, and 0 in other positions, to obtain a diagonality measure, d. Overall,

418

ng=50 genes were resampled nresamp=100 times, and for each resampling-iteration, a permutation

419

test based on value d was applied using nperm=1000 permutations. Accordingly, each of the above

420

nresamp=100 permutation tests indicate the probability that S1 and S2 show non-random diagonality,

421

on a subset of ng=50 genes. Then, the count of permutation tests indicating a significant similarity

422

to the ideal diagonal matrix, out of the nresamp =100 subsamples is used for estimating diagonality

Figure 1 Developmental time points studied and examples for gene expression profiles on
the three species. (A) Images of adult and larval stage of P. miniata, P. lividus and S. purpuratus
Arrows point to the sea urchin skeletogenic rods and arrow heads point to the sea urchin
pigments. (B) Images of P. miniata, P. lividus and S. purpuratus embryos at the developmental
stages that were studied in this work. Time point 6hpf in S. purpuratus does not have RNA-seq
data. (C) Relative gene expression in the three species measured in the current paper by RNA-seq
for P. miniata (orange curves), in [17] by RNA-seq for P. lividus (purple curves) and in [23] by
nanostring for S. purpuratus (black curves). Error bars indicate standard deviation. To obtain
relative expression levels for each species we divide the level at each time point in the maximal
mRNA level measured for this species in this time interval; so 1 is the maximal expression in this
time interval.

Figure 3 Interspecies Pearson correlations for different GO terms, ordered by the level of
matrix diagonality (MD) of Pl-Sp matrices. In each panel, from A to J, we present the Pearson
correlation of the expression levels of genes with specific GO term between different
developmental stages in the three species. Upper matrix in each panel shows the Pearson
correlation between the two sea urchins (P. lividus and S. purpuratus) and the bottom matrix is
the Pearson correlation between the sea star, P. miniata and the sea urchin P. lividus. These
matrices include the seven developmental points that have RNA-seq data in all species (Fig. 1B,
excluding 9hpf in P. miniata and 4hpf in P. lividus). In each panel we indicate the GO term
tested, the number of genes in each set, the average correlation strength in the diagonal (AC) and
the matrix diagonality (MD), see text for explanation. Color scale is similar for all graphs and
given at the middle of the figure. F, shows the Pearson interspecies correlation for all 1:1:1 genes.

Figure 4 Interspecies Pearson correlations in gene expression for genes enriched in specific
sea urchin lineages. A-F, each panel shows the interspecies Pearson correlation between the
developmental stages in the three species for genes that their expression enriched at specific time
point in a particular cell lineage in the sea urchin, S. purpuratus according to [28]. The cell
lineages at the time where the enrichment was observed are illustrated by the embryo diagrams
above the relevant correlation pattern[28], the time point is also marked in a black square in each
Pl-Sp panel. In each panel we indicate lineage were these genes are enriched, the number of
genes in each set, the average correlation strength in the diagonal (AC) and the matrix diagonality
(MD), see text for explanation. Color scale is similar for all graphs and given at the top.

Figure 5 The average correlation strength and the matrix diagonality are independent
parameters that reflect different properties of expression conservation. A, the average
correlation strength in the diagonal (AC) between Pl-Sp (black bars) and Pl-Pm (red bars) in
receding order of Pl-Pm correlation strength. B, Matrix diagonality (MD) of the interspecies
correlations between Pl-Sp (black bars) and Pl-Pm (cyan bars) in receding order of Pl-Pm matrix
diagonality. C, the matrix diagonality changes independently of the average correlation for both
Pl-Sp (black dots) and Pl-Pm (orange dots). D, the interspecies average correlation between S.
purpuratus and P. lividus corresponds to the interspecies average correlation between P. lividus
and P. miniata (excluding skeletogenic genes, R pearson = 0.68). E, the matrix diagonality of
the interspecies correlations between S. purpuratus and P. lividus relates to the matrix diagonality
between P. lividus and P. miniata (excluding skeletogenic genes, R Pearson = 0.78).

Figure 6 The correlation matrix diagonality, MD, reflects how the dominance between
cellular and developmental constraints changes with evolutionary distance for different
functional classes. Illustration of typical interspecies correlation matrices of developmental
control genes and housekeeping genes between closely related and further diverged (lower
species (upper and lower panels, respectively). With increasing evolutionary distance, that is,
between the sea urchin and the sea star, the average correlation and the diagonality decrease for
all gene sets but the diagonality of developmental control genes is least affected and they that still
maintain the hourglass pattern (lower left panel). On the other hand, the interspecies correlation
matrices of housekeeping genes are strong and non-diagonal even between the two sea urchins
and remain non-diagonal between the sea urchin and the sea star (right panels).
