Abstract
Neutrophils play fundamental roles in innate inflammatory response, shape adaptive
immunity1, and have been identified as a potentially causal cell type underpinning
genetic associations with immune system traits and diseases2,3 The majority of these
variants are non-coding and the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here,
we profiled the binding of one of the principal myeloid transcriptional regulators, PU.1,
in primary neutrophils across nearly a hundred volunteers, and elucidate the
coordinated genetic effects of PU.1 binding variation, local chromatin state, promoterenhancer interactions and gene expression. We show that PU.1 binding and the
associated chain of molecular changes underlie genetically-driven differences in cell
count and autoimmune disease susceptibility. Our results advance interpretation for
genetic loci associated with neutrophil biology and immune disease.

Results
Non-coding DNA sequence variation affects chromatin state and gene expression
within human populations, and accounts for the majority of complex genetic traits and disease
associations4-7. The commonly accepted model of genetic control of transcriptional activity
postulates that genetic variation modifies the DNA recognition sequences of specific
transcription factors (TFs), thus altering their ability to bind to DNA at a specific locus8-15. PU.1
(encoded by Spi1) is a key TF regulating myeloid development16-18, and its deficiency has
profound effects on neutrophil maturation and function19,20. To study genetically determined
variation in PU.1 recruitment to DNA, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing
(ChIP-seq) to profile PU.1 genome wide binding in human primary neutrophils (CD16+
CD66b+) isolated from 93 donors of the BLUEPRINT project. The same donors were
previously characterised at genome-wide DNA sequence and multi-level regulatory
annotation7 (Figure 1a). We identified 36,530 TF-binding peaks across the 93 individuals
(Online Methods, Supplementary Figure 1, Supplementary Table 1) and used normalised read
counts at peak regions to determine transcription factor quantitative trait loci (tfQTLs; Online
Methods). We detected 1,868 independent (linkage disequilibrium [LD] r2≥0.8) PU.1 binding
QTLs at a False Discovery Rate [FDR] <0.05 (Supplementary Table 2). Lead PU.1 tfQTL
SNPs showed a bimodal distribution of distances to their respective differential binding peaks
(Figure 1b, Supplementary Table 3), with just over half of them (55%, 1,036/1,868) mapping
proximally from the peak edge (<2.5kb; median distance 264bp), and the remaining SNPs
(45%; 995/1,868) localising more distally (2.5Kb-1Mb, median distance 23Kb)21,22. As shown
for other cell types22, tfQTL effect sizes were stronger for proximal compared to distal variants
(t-test p=2.2x10-16, Figure 1c). We further validated a subset of the detected tfQTLs using
allele-specific association analysis23 (Online Methods), which confirmed a significant allelic
imbalance for the majority of the tested peaks (98.8% and 95.5% for peaks associated with
proximal and distal variants respectively; Figure 1d).

Binding of pioneer TFs to DNA alters local nucleosome positioning, thus allowing
recruitment of activating co-factors24. However, DNA recognition sequence alone is not
sufficient to establish occupancy, and secondary collaborating factors are required to maintain
affinity25. C/EBPβ is upregulated throughout neutrophil terminal differentiation18 and has been
shown to co-occupy myeloid enhancers at thousands of PU.1 bound sites26,27. The
constitutively expressed CTCF is known to play a role in gene regulation by anchoring
chromatin interactions28, but is not known to functionally associate with PU.1. We assayed
these two additional TFs in neutrophils from a subset of overlapping individuals (n=22 donors
with QC-pass assays for C/EBPβ, n=30 for CTCF), and identified 18,862 C/EBPβ and 22,197
CTCF filtered peaks from the combined datasets. We performed QTL analysis as before, and
prioritised 427 C/EBPβ and 769 CTCF putative tfQTLs reaching a nominal p-value threshold
(p≤1x10-5; Supplementary Table 2). We found that C/EBPβ tfQTLs effect sizes decreased with
increasing distance from PU.1 tfQTLs (Figure 2a-b), reflecting cooperative binding of PU.1
and C/EBPβ at myeloid enhancers26,29. Interestingly, CTCF tfQTLs displaying a shared genetic
effect with PU.1 predominantly involved CTCF-bound regions located distally to the PU.1
tfQTL lead SNP, suggesting that PU.1 QTL genetic effects may be in part mediated by the 3D
chromosomal architecture (Figure 2c).

Transcription factor occupancy has been shown to act predominantly through cis
regulatory SNPs, where coordination of cis-acting variants has been shown to decay with
increasing physical distance of SNPs from bound regions30. To assess the potential sharing
of our tfQTLs across cell types, we additionally generated PU.1 binding maps in primary
monocytes (CD14+CD16−) isolated from ten BLUEPRINT donors7, five of which overlap with
the neutrophil PU.1 dataset. Of the neutrophil PU.1 peaks implicating a tfQTL, 93% were also
observed in monocytes (Supplementary Figure 2a). The low number of donors tested did not
allow us to carry out a tfQTL analysis in monocytes. To assess coordination of genetic effects
at PU.1 binding sites across cell types, we therefore assessed the strength of binding at
monocyte peaks for individuals stratified by PU.1 tfQTL lead variant genotype. We found the

monocytes displayed consistent direction and strength of binding at proximal SNPs (linear
regression p=3x10-9) compared to neutrophils (p=2x10-13), compatible with shared genetic
effects between the two cell types. However, the same was not true for distal SNPs
(neutrophils p=4x10-7, monocytes p=0.793; Figure 2d), which may be driven by more complex
and cell-type specific long-distance chromatin contacts.

To explore coordination of genetic influences on PU.1 binding and local chromatin
state, we initially took advantage of the previously published histone associated QTL (hQTL)
data for the enhancer-associated histone marks H3K4me1 and H3K27ac in neutrophils7. In
total, 808 H3K4me1 and 946 H3K27ac lead hQTL SNPs overlapped (r2≥0.8) PU.1 tfQTLs. We
next generated binding profiles of the active promoter-associated histone mark H3K4me3 and
Polycomb-associated repressive mark H3K27me3 in neutrophils (n=110 and n=109 donors,
respectively) identifying 621 and 367 shared tfQTL/hQTLs, respectively (Supplementary Table
2). Using the pi1 statistic31, we found evidence of sharing between PU.1 tfQTLs with hQTLs in
both neutrophils and monocytes (pi1H3K27ac=0.73-0.76, and pi1H3K4me1=0.76-0.80). Sharing
between neutrophil PU.1 tfQTLs and hQTLs detected in CD4 naïve T cells was lower
(pi1H3K27ac=0.36-0.72, and pi1H3K4me1=0.30-0.79; Supplementary Figure 2c), compatible with
PU.1 not being expressed in the latter (Supplementary Figure 2c)32. Further, H3K27ac marked
regions7 co-occupied by PU.1 and C/EBPβ displayed greater hQTL effect sizes compared to
peaks bound by PU.1 alone (t-test p=1.34x10-6; Figure 2e), suggesting stronger genetic effects
for enhancers at co-occupied sites in neutrophils29. Consistent with this, cell type-specific
binding of PU.1 and C/EBPβ correlated with cell type-specific chromatin activity
(Supplementary Figure 3a-b). H3K27ac and H3K4me1 hQTLs intersecting proximal
neutrophil-specific PU.1 tfQTLs had significantly lower effect sizes in monocytes compared to
cell-shared sites (Figure 2f), consistent with a neutrophil-specific role of PU.1 in activating
chromatin state in these regions.
We next assessed the distance between the PU.1 and histone mark peaks for each

shared tfQTL-hQTL genetic association. As previously observed21, there was a pronounced
bimodal distribution of distances between PU.1 binding peaks and the locations of H3K27ac
and H3K4me3 marks (Figure 3a), with around a half of PU.1 peaks localizing to less than 1kb
away from the respective H3K27ac and H3K4me3 peaks, and others mapping 10-100kb from
them. Given that H3K4me3 is associated with active promoters, this observation highlights the
potential long-range regulatory effects of PU.1 binding to distal DNA elements on promoter
activity, which are commonly mediated by three-dimensional DNA looping interactions33. To
investigate the role of PU.1 long distance regulation, we generated Capture Hi-C (PCHi-C)
profiling in neutrophils and monocytes isolated from three donors each and integrated these
data with previously published PCHi-C data for these cell types in three more individuals34
(Supplementary Figure 4a-b). We detected ~190,000 Promoter Interacting Regions (PIRs) in
total across neutrophils and monocytes (CHiCAGO score > 5)35, ~82,000 of which were
detectable in each of the cell types (Supplementary Figure 4c). PIRs enriched in PU.1 binding
and enhancer-associated H3K4me1/H3K27ac marks were correlated with the level of
expression of the genes they contacted (Figure 3b), as previously shown in the context of
other cell types36-38. In contrast, CTCF binding at PIRs did not correlate with target gene
expression (Figure 3b), as expected given the constitutive nature of many CTCF-mediated
chromosomal interactions. Notably, the PIRs of genes showing differential expression
between neutrophils and monocytes were enriched (100 permutations, p≤0.01) for the binding
of PU.1 and C/EBPβ in the highest-expressing cell type (Figure 3c). Consistently we also
found cell type-specific binding of these TFs to be enriched within cell type-specific PIRs
(permutation p≤0.01) (Figure 3d). Jointly, these results reinforce the role of PU.1 and C/EBPβ
in establishing tissue-specific transcriptional patterns.
We next investigated the effect of PU.1 binding variation at PIRs on the expression of
target genes. PU.1 tfQTLs were intersected with PCHi-C and expression QTL (eQTL) data
from the Chen et al. study7. Only PU.1 tfQTL/eQTL (p<1x10-5) pairs located distally to TSSs
(>25Kb) were considered, in order to exclude eQTLs implicating promoter-based variants and

ensure a high resolution of PCHi-C signal detection. PU.1 tfQTL SNPs mapping to PIRs
showed significantly larger effects on the expression of the genes they contacted compared
with distance-matched SNPs that did not map to a PIR (t-test p<2x10-16; Figure 3e), in
agreement with physical interactions playing a role in mediating the distal regulatory effects of
PU.1 binding.
To explore the extent to which genetic variation affecting PU.1 binding may directly
affect promoter-enhancer interactions, we employed an allele-specific strategy (Methods) to
identify heterozygous sites within PIRs that exhibited allelic imbalance at PCHiC contacts
(Supplementary Figure 4d-e). We found that ~14,000 heterozygous SNPs within PIRs that
displayed evidence of allelic bias in both neutrophils and monocytes were enriched for PU.1
and CTCF binding (Figure 4a-c, Supplementary Figure 4f). Notably, the same was true for the
hQTLs for the Polycomb-associated inhibitory mark H3K27me3, consisted with a role of
Polycomb repressive complexes in shaping regulatory chromatin architecture39. An example
of a SNP showing allelic imbalance affecting promoter-enhancer connectivity was rs519989,
which was also associated with PU.1 binding, histone modifications and expression the gene
LRRC8C (Figure 4d-f; Supplementary Table 4). LRRC8C encodes a volume-regulated anion
channel subunit40 upregulated during terminal differentiation of neutrophils41. This and other
loci thus demonstrate coordinated genetic influences on PU.1 binding, chromatin activity and
the formation of promoter interactions in the regulation of neutrophil gene expression.

Finally, to explore the influence of the identified PU.1 tfQTLs and their potential
downstream effects on haematological traits and diseases, we accessed summary statistics
from public GWAS studies of cell-matched full blood count traits2 and autoimmune diseases4247

PU.1 binding regions were enriched48 for GWAS SNPs associated with myeloid cell traits

(eg. neutrophil counts) and with autoimmune diseases (Figure 5a). We formally tested the
overlap of PU.1 tfQTLs and GWAS SNPs using colocalisation analysis49,50, revealing 43
proximal and 74 distal tfQTLs that shared a genetic signal (posterior probability [PP]>0.9) with

at least one GWAS locus (Table 1, Supplementary Table 5). We next used CATO (Contextual
Analysis of TF Occupancy)51 to identify PU.1 collaborating factors that may be involved in
mediating these traits at shared PU.1 tfQTL / GWAS loci. Colocalising SNPs were shown to
affect predominantly binding recognition motifs for several PU.1 binding partners, including
C/EBP, AP-1, ETS, CTF/NF-1, ATF/CREB and RUNX (Supplementary Figure 5)52. These
results highlight the likely role of PU.1 and its partners in mediating the functional effects of
GWAS variants in neutrophils.

To determine the putative target genes underpinning PU.1-mediated disease
associations, we integrated PCHi-C and eQTL data7 in neutrophils. Overall, 27 high
confidence target genes at QTL loci colocalised with GWAS summary statistics
(Supplementary Table 6). Interestingly, 35% of the shared tfQTL / GWAS SNPs could be
attributed to a proximal tfQTL at a PU.1 binding site. This finding suggests that many of PU.1
tfQTL themselves are under distal genetic control potentially mediated through enhancerenhancer interactions53-55. One such example is the rs791357_C variant associated with
decreased neutrophil and monocyte cell counts. PCHi-C data shows that this region is highly
connected to the CPEB4 gene in both neutrophils and monocytes (Figure 5b). CPEB4 is a
cytoplasmic polyadenylation element which binds to recognition sequence in PolyA tail of
mRNAs and can activate or inhibit translation56. CPEB4 is involved in controlling terminal
differentiation in erythroid cells57 and the proliferation of some cancers58. The SNP rs791357
is a proximal tfQTL for PU.1 (p=9.05x10-21) and C/EBPβ (p=1.963x10-9), an hQTL for
H3K4me3 (p=1.98x10-17) and H3K27ac (p=1.41x10-33) and an eQTL for CPEB4 (p=1.16x1030)

in neutrophils. Similar sharing of PU.1 and C/EBPβ binding site was observed in monocytes

with hQTL (H3K27ac p=8.14x10-26) and eQTL for CPEB4 (p=2.55x10-18). Additional example
loci shared tfQTL function through multiple traits and the presence of PCHi-C interactions
between enhancers and colocalised genes (Supplementary Figure 6a-b).

In conclusion, our analysis suggests that genetically-determined variation in PU.1
binding in neutrophils modulates gene expression, acting via changes in the local chromatin
state and, at least in some cases, in the patterns of promoter-enhancer interactions. We show
that these effects underpin the genetic associations for a number of important human blood
cell traits and diseases, confirming the role of PU.1 in neutrophil biology and implicating this
cell type as a potentially causal for a number of autoimmune traits.

Online Methods

Sample collection and cell isolation

Peripheral adult blood collection
ChIP-seq data generated in this study used donor samples which were collected as part of
the previously described study7. Blood was obtained from donors who were members of the
NIHR Cambridge BioResource (http://www.cambridgebioresource.org.uk/) with informed
consent (REC 12/EE/0040) at the NHS Blood and Transplant, Cambridge. Donors were on
average 55 years old (range 20-75 years old), with 46% of donors being male. A unit of whole
blood (475 ml) was collected in 3.2% Sodium Citrate. An aliquot of this sample was collected
in EDTA for genomic DNA purification. A full blood count (FBC) for all donors was obtained
from an EDTA blood sample, collected in parallel with the whole blood unit, using a Sysmex
Haematological analyser. The level of C-reactive protein (CRP), an inflammatory marker, was
also measured in the sera of all individuals. All donors used for the collection had FBC and
CRP parameters within the normal healthy range. Blood was processed within 4 hours of
collection.

Isolation of cell subsets
Samples were as those as described in7. To obtain pure samples of ‘classical’ monocytes
(CD14+ CD16-) and neutrophils (CD66b+ CD16+) we implemented a multi-step purification
strategy. Whole blood was diluted 1:1 in a buffer of Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline
(PBS, Sigma) containing 13mM sodium citrate tribasic dehydrate (Sigma) and 0.2% human
serum albumin (HSA, PAA) and separated using an isotonic Percoll gradient of 1.078 g/ml
(Fisher Scientific). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected and washed
twice with buffer, diluted to 25 million cells/ml and separated into two layers, a monocyte rich
layer and a lymphocyte rich layer, using a Percoll gradient of 1.066g/ml. Cells from each layer

were washed in PBS (13mM sodium citrate and 0.2% HSA) and subsets purified using an
antibody/magnetic bead strategy. To purify monocytes, CD16+ cells were depleted from the
monocyte rich layer using CD16 microbeads (Miltenyi) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Cells were washed in PBS (13mM sodium citrate and 0.2% HSA) and CD14+
cells were positively selected using CD14 microbeads (Miltenyi). To purify neutrophils, the
dense layer of cells from the 1.078 g/ml Percoll separation was lysed twice using an
ammonium chloride buffer to remove erythrocytes. The resulting cells (including neutrophils
and eosinophils) were washed and neutrophils positively selected using CD16 microbeads
(Miltenyi) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purity of each cell preparation was
assessed by multicolour FACS using conjugated antibodies for CD14 (MφP9, BD Biosciences)
and CD16 (B73.1 / leu11c, BD Biosciences) for monocytes, CD16 (VEP13, MACS, Miltenyi)
and CD66b (BIRMA 17C, IBGRL-NHS) for neutrophils. Purity was on average 95% for
monocytes and 98% for neutrophils.

ChIP-sequencing
Purified cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde (Sigma) at a concentration of approximately
10 million cells/ml. Fixed cell preparations were washed and stored re-suspended in PBS at
4°C prior to lysis and sonication. Sonication protocols were performed in a Diagenode
PicoRuptor for 8 cycles of 30 seconds on, 30 seconds off in a 4oC water cooler. Samples were
checked for sonication efficiency using the criteria of 150-500bp, by Agilent DNA bioanalyzer.
ChIP-seq was carried out as previously described59 all liquid handling steps were performed
on an Agilent Bravo NGS. Protein A Dynabeads (Invitrogen) were coupled with 2.5µg of
antibody. Sonicated lysate (3-5 million cells) was then added to the bead/antibody mix and
incubated at 4oC overnight. ChIP-DNA bound beads were washed for ten repetitions in cold
RIPA solution. Elution of DNA from beads at 65oC for five hours to reverse the cross linking
process. 2µl RNase was added to ChIP-DNA and incubated at 37oC for 30 minutes, followed
by 2µl of Proteinase K treatment at 55 oC for 1 hour. 1:1.8 ratio of Ampure beads (Beckman
Coulter, A63881) were added to the DNA followed by two cold 70% ethanol washes. ChIP11

DNA was eluted in 50µl elution buffer. Illumina sequencing libraries were prepared on a
Beckman Fx liquid handling system. End-repair, A-tailing and paired-end adapter ligation were
performed using NEBnext reagents from New England Biolabs (E6000S), with purification
using a 1:1 ratio of AMPure XP to sample between each reaction. Amplification of ChIP-DNA
was performed using Kapa HiFi master mix (Kapa Biosystems KK2602), 18 cycles of PCR
followed by a 0.7:1 Ampure XP clean-up. Antibodies for H3K4me3 (C15410003), H3K27me3
(C15410195), CTCF (C15410210) were obtained from Diagenode, Liege, Belgium. Antibodies
for PU.1 (sc-352x, sc-22805x) and C/EBPβ (sc-150x) were obtained from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology.

Data processing and peak calling
ChIP libraries were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2000 and HiSeq 2500 at 50bp single end
reads. Sequenced reads were aligned to reference genome using BWA (bwa aln –q 15).
Duplicate reads were marked using Picard MarkDuplicates (v1.103). Reads with mapping
quality less than 15 were removed (SAMtools v0.1.18). The fragment size L for each aligned
bam was estimated using PhantomPeakQualTools vr18, which uses cross correlation of
binned read counts between forward and reverse strands. To identify highly enriched genomic
regions, we used MACS2

60

(v2.0.10.20131216, standard options) for peak calling with the

estimated fragment size from PhantomPeakQualTools (--shiftsize=half fragment size), with
narrow for PU.1, C/EBPβ, CTCF, H3K4me3 and broad flags set for H3K27me3. For
background control ChIP input was created from merging random selected samples. Reads
from 4 pools of 12 individuals for neutrophil input and 2 pools of 6 individuals for monocytes.

Significant peaks were selected to be at 1% FDR or less.
Data Quality
We removed ChIP samples that had a relative strand correlation (RSC) < 0.8 and normalised
strand correlation (NSC) < 1.05

61.

We defined high confidence data those from ChIP with

RSC > 0.8 and NSC > 1.05. Otherwise, we used genome browser tracks to confirm visually
a good ChIP and include it in the final data set. Supplementary Figure 1 and Supplementary
Table 1 shows quality control metrics and corresponding principal components, showing no
batch effects after PEER correction using K=10 factors.

Normalised read count in the reference peak set
Consensus peak sets were constructed using dba.peakset function within DiffBind R package
62,63.

http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DiffBind/inst/doc/DiffBind.pdf.

For PU.1, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 we set the minimum number of samples for a peak to be
included in consensus to 3, for C/EBPβ, CTCF and monocyte samples minimum was set to 2.
Sex chromosomes were not included in the QTL analysis. The reference peak set was filtered
further for read counts as described below. Next, we generated quantification signal of ChIPseq for each donor. Here we only considered read counts under the peaks, as the regions
outside peaks are more likely to be noise or background signal than true enrichment. For
each donor, we generated a vector of log2 reads per million (log2RPM) per peak in the
reference peak set by counting the number of overlapping reads under the peaks (BEDOPS
bedmap –count) and normalised the counts with the total number of reads in the library. We
further filtered the reference peak set to only consider peaks with log2RPM > 0 in at least 50%
of the donors in a given cell type, corrected for ten PEER factors and applied quantile
normalisation across donors. For QTL calling with H3K27me3, two sets of summary statistics
are provided on two separate signal matrices. In the first set H3K4me3 peak annotations were

used in conjunction with H3K27me3 signal to enrich for poised promoter QTLs. In the second
set broad called H3K27me3 peaks were divided into 2500bp windows.

Identification of PU.1 and C/EBPβ differential binding sites
We used DiffBind version 1.12.0 with default EdgeR (3.8.3) option to identify peaks which
were differentially bound between neutrophils and monocytes. We used the six best quality
samples and their peak sets for this analysis:

Transcription factor enrichments
For determining enrichment of ChIP-seq regions of interest within PIRs we used regioneR
(1.0.3)65, which performs a statistical evaluation of two sets of genomic regions by permutation
testing. We set to 50 permutations the randomisation of genomic regions to determine the null.
In Figure 3b-d are Neu PU.1 and Mono PU.1 regions identified from DiffBind differential

CD4 T cells, Neutrophils, Monocytes, Megakaryocytes and Erythrocytes. These were split into
three classifications: (i) PIRs that were found in neutrophil and one other cell type, (ii) PIRs
that were found in monocyte and one other cell type, and (iii) as an outgroup, megakaryocyte
PIRs that were not shared with neutrophil and monocyte.

Differentially expressed genes and gene expression counts
Gene expression counts and list of differentially expressed genes were available from Ecker
et al.3

QTL mapping
Cis-acting QTL mapping was done using the LIMIX package66, available from github
(https://github.com/PMBio/limix). We considered genetic variants mapping to within 1 Mb (on
each side) of each tested feature (peak), and tested their association using linear regression.
Models were fit on quantile-normalized PEER residuals, also including a random effect term
accounting for polygenic signal and sample relatedness (as in the variance component models
above we used the realized relatedness matrix to capture sample relatedness). From the linear
regression we obtained the effect size and p-value for each tested association. To correct for
multiple hypothesis testing, we performed a two-step procedure67: first, we corrected for
multiple testing across variants for each molecular outcome using Bonferroni correction and,
second, we adjusted the obtained p-values for multiple-testing across phenotypes within each
layer using a the Q-value procedure31, considered QTLs at a significance threshold of 5%
FDR.

Promoter Capture HiC (PCHi-C)
Cells were isolated as described34. One donor was used for preparing each PCHi-C library. In
total, twelve PCHi-C libraries were prepared, six using monocytes and six using neutrophils.
Approximately 8x10-7cells per library were resuspended in 30.625 ml of DMEM supplemented
with 10% FBS, and 4.375 ml of formaldehyde was added (16% stock solution; 2% final

concentration). The fixation reaction continued for 10 min at room temperature with mixing
and was then quenched by the addition of 5 ml of 1 M glycine (125 mM final concentration).
Cells were incubated at room temperature for 5 min and then on ice for 15 min. Cells were
pelleted by centrifugation at 400g for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was discarded. The
pellet was washed briefly in cold PBS, and samples were centrifuged again to pellet the cells.
The supernatant was removed, and the cell pellets were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and
stored at −80 °C. Biotinylated 120­mer RNA baits were designed to the ends of HindIII
restriction fragments overlapping Ensembl­ annotated promoters of protein ­coding,
noncoding, antisense, snRNA, miRNA and snoRNA transcripts37. A target sequence was
accepted if its GC content ranged between 25% and 65%, the sequence contained no more
than two consecutive Ns and was within 330 bp of the HindIII restriction fragment terminus. A
total of 22,076 HindIII fragments were captured, containing a total of 31,253 annotated
promoters for 18,202 protein coding and 10,929 non­protein genes according to Ensembl v75
(http://grch37.ensembl.org). Hi­C library generation was carried with in-nucleus ligation as
described previously68. Chromatin was then de-crosslinked and purified by phenol:chloroform
extraction. DNA concentration was measured using Quant­iT PicoGreen (Life Technologies),
and 40 μg of DNA was sheared to an average size of 400 bp, using the manufacturer's
instructions (Covaris). The sheared DNA was end­repaired, adenine­tailed and double sizeselected using AMPure XP beads to isolate DNA ranging from 250 to 550 bp. Ligation
fragments marked by biotin were immobilized using MyOne Streptavidin C1 DynaBeads
(Invitrogen) and ligated to paired-end adaptors (Illumina). The immobilized Hi­C libraries were
amplified using PE PCR 1.0 and PE PCR 2.0 primers (Illumina) with 7 PCR amplification
cycles. PCHi­C. Capture Hi­C of promoters was carried out with SureSelect target enrichment,
using the custom designed biotinylated RNA bait library and custom paired­ end blockers
according to the manufacturer's instructions (Agilent Technologies). After library enrichment,
a post capture PCR amplification step was carried out using PE PCR 1.0 and PE PCR 2.0
primers with 4 PCR amplification cycles. For more details, see

HICUP and CHiCAGO Sequencing reads were processed and mapped with HiCUP and PCHiC interaction was called using CHiCAGO with default parameters35,69.

Datasets
Data generated in this study was deposited to the European Genome-phenome Archive under
the following accession IDs: transcription factor data: EGAD00001004571; H3K4me3:
EGAD00001002711; H3K27me3: EGAD00001002712; PCHiC: EGAS00001001911.

Genotyping check of ChIP-Seq and PCHi-C bams
Identity matching for each sample and for each analysis was performed by extracting
genotypes from RNA-seq and ChIP-seq and comparing them to SNPs from the WGS data.
The first stage of verifying the sample identity concordance between the RNA-seq/ChIP-seq
and WGS data involved pre-processing the BAM files for one autosomal chromosome (chr1)
to remove PCR duplicates and reads with mapping quality score <10. The variants were then
called from the resulting BAM file using mpileup from the SAMtools package

70.

The variants

with QUAL <20, DP <5 and GQ <5 were filtered out. Then, we compared genotypes of the
filtered variants with genotypes generated from WGS and imputation. The genotypes
generated were considered to be from the same sample if the concordance rate was greater
than 90%.

Allele specific analysis of transcription factor binding
For allele specific analysis, we used the phased WGS VCF that was also utilised for QTL
mapping but here we removed indels and only considered biallelic single nucleotide variants.
We then mapped deduplicated ChIP-seq reads on each allele of each SNVs using GATK
ASEReadCounter with default parameters, base quality ≥2 and mapping quality ≥15. We then
filtered for heterozygous SNVs only with ≥ 10 read counts per site and nonzero counts in both
alleles. We required 2 donors meeting these read counts criteria at each site. To carry out
association analysis, we used Rasqual23 with total read counts per sample as offset

parameter. Note that Rasqual uses a model that corrects for reference mapping bias and
genotyping errors. To correct for non-genetic confounders, we applied PCA with and without
permutation on normalised read counts in log2RPM across all sites and picked the first N
components whose explained variances are greater than those from permutation as
covariates for Rasqual. Finally, we only considered SNVs found within peaks to determine
direct allele specific effect on TF binding of PU.1 and CTCF in neutrophils.

Allele specific analysis of PCHI-C
The genotypes of PCHIC donors were obtained from Cambridge Bioresource phase 4
(Illumina core exome chip). We phased the genotype using BEAGLE2 (v2.0.5) 71 and imputed
using Positional Burrows-Wheeler Transform and Haplotype Reference Consortium (release
1.1) as reference panel, via the Sanger imputation service. We then filtered sites for ≥5%
minor allele frequency, HWE p-value ≥ 1x10-6, ≤5% sample missingness and INFO score ≥
0.8. We removed indels and only considered biallelic single nucleotide variants. We used
WASP 72 to remove PCHIC reads that are likely to be biased towards the reference allele. We
then mapped deduplicated ChIP-seq reads on each allele of each SNVs using GATK
ASEReadCounter with default parameters, base quality ≥2 and mapping quality ≥15. We then
filtered for heterozygous SNVs only with ≥ 10 read counts per site and nonzero counts in both
alleles. Finally, we only considered heterozygous sites with allele bias of ≤40% or ≥ 60%,
after removing extreme bias of <1% or >100%.

Enrichment analysis of tfQTLs and hQTLs in PIRs
Each of these heterozygous SNVs was annotated based on whether they were located in a
PIR and whether they were significant tfQTLs (PU.1 and CTCF; p<1x10-5) or significant hQTLs
(H3K27me3, H3K4me3, H3K27ac; p<1x10-5). Fisher’s exact tests were carried out separately
for each sample and for each cell type to test for enrichment of tfQTLs and hQTLs that fall into
PIRs. Finally, the mean and standard deviation were calculated across all samples for each
cell type. In another approach, all samples were combined across both cell types. SNVs were

removed if they were not observed in at least two samples, or in one sample and in the two
cell types, or if the allelic ratio (REF reads/ALT reads) was not consistent across the samples
or cell types. Enrichment was tested for SNVs where at least N samples fell into a PIR and at
least N samples carried a significant tfQTL or hQTL for increasing number of samples N
(N=1,2,3,4).

Enrichment of genome wide association SNPs within ChIP-seq marked regions
To test for significant enrichment of trait associated SNPs within regions of interest, we applied
GWAS analysis of regulatory or functional information enrichment with LD (GARFIELD)48.
H3K27ac and H3K4me1 occupied regions in neutrophils were obtained from7. Neutrophil
annotations for PU.1, C/EBPβ, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 were generated as described
above. With the exception that H3K27me3, regions were not chunked into 2.5Kb bins.
Monocyte annotation are described in Supplementary Figure 3a for PU.1 and C/EBPβ.

Colocalisation between diseases and molecular trait
To overlap our QTL results to GWAS catalogue, we calculated the LD information based on
our WGS data using plink v1.9

73.

For all the QTLs that either directly mapped to the GWAS

variants or in LD (r2≥0.8), we considered that the QTL variant overlapped with a GWAS signal.
For the cases where we further selected six autoimmune diseases, we took forward the
overlapping disease variants with P-value ≤5x10-8 in six selected studies are celiac disease

as a negative control. We used a Bayesian colocalization

to elucidate whether the observed overlap between disease and molecular trait

may due to a shared genetic effect. The method calculates the posterior probability (PP),
versus the null model of no association, for four alternative models: a model where a region
or locus contains a single variant associated with either the molecular trait or disease (models

1,2); a model where a single causal variant affects association with both traits (model 3); or a
model where two distinct associations exist (model 4). The method derives the PP of each
variant in the locus being causal one under different models, and the PP of a given locus is
then the integral sum of the PPs of all variants within, with all variants under equal prior
probability to be causal. The prior for each model is computed to be one that maximizes the
log-likelihood function 50. We acknowledge the limitations of the model: it assumes one causal
variant in the locus; and in the case of high LD between two causal variants the model has
limited power to distinguish model 4 from model 3. We also note that colocalization does not
imply a causal relationship between molecular trait and diseases, but may be compatible also
with the same variant having independent (‘pleiotropic’) effects on molecular traits and
disease. We applied colocalization test for each of the 1,003 disease-molecular trait pairs,
where the lead SNPs in both traits are in high. r2≥0.8. To avoid overlapping 2Mb-wide genetic
loci due to features in close proximity (e.g., splicing junctions, genes, histones peaks, CpGs
in islands), we tested colocalization per locus, which means that the prior model parameters
were estimated using one locus instead of multiple loci and hence the priors may be
overestimated.

removed sites with extreme Allele Specific (AS) bias (<0.01 or >100). 89% of sites with AS
bias in NEU and 92% in MON had a consistent AS ratio if found in more than one individual.
The percentage of sites with consistent AS bias detected in two individuals drops to 16% and
15%, and it drops further to just 3% or to <1% when shared by three or four individuals. The
plot shows the mean allele-specific (AS) ratio or bias and the 95% confidence interval by
individual in neutrophils and monocytes. The mean AS ratio increases when AS ratios are
shared across samples in a consistent manner. In almost all individuals AS ratios are higher
in monocytes than in neutrophils. e. Left heat map; Percentage of sharing between cell types
of SNVs that are located in PIRs. Sharing is shown between monocytes (left) and neutrophils
(right) in five matched samples (monocytes mean = 14.4%, neutrophils mean = 18.2%) and
one mismatched sample (Mon2 and Neu5), (monocytes mean = 6.0%, neutrophils mean =
6.6%). Right heat map; Percentage of sharing between cell types of SNVs that are significant
PU.1 QTLs (p<1x10-5). Sharing is shown between monocytes (left) and neutrophils (right) in
five matched samples (monocytes mean = 37.0%, neutrophils mean = 33.9%) and one
mismatched sample (Mon2 and Neu5), (monocytes mean = 17.0%, neutrophils mean =
15.9%). f. Allele-specific SNVs, identified through PCHi-C, were selected if they were
observed in at least two samples or cell types, and if their REF/ALT ratio was consistent, i.e.
either > 1 or < 1, across all samples. Enrichment of QTLs in PIRs was then calculated for
14,000 SNPs that fulfilled these criteria and that were supported by an increasing number of
samples that showed evidence for falling into a PIR and being a significant QTL (N=1,2,3,4).
Enrichment increased when increasing the number of supporting samples.

Supplementary Figure 6. Examples of disease associated loci.
a. Example of colocalised signal for PU.1 tfQTL, rs13035725 (p = 2.44x10-10) identifies a risk
locus for inflammatory bowel disease and ulcerative colitis. The same SNP is also significantly
associated with expression of several genes in neutrophils, including ARPC2 (p=3.70x10-20),
CXCR2 (p=4.25x10-13), AAMP (p=1.02x10-8) and CXCR1 (p=1.23x10-6), all of which were
weakly or not significant in monocytes. These genes perform highly relevant immune functions
for example in neutrophil migration, suggesting disease risk may be mediated through
neutrophil biology. The region also displayed high connectivity in the neutrophil PCHi-C data
(CHiCAGO score > 5), but depleted of significant interactions in monocytes. In orange location
of rs4674259 the most significant shared SNP between tfQTL and GWAS data sets. b.

by donor genotype for rs9712275. The sentinel SNP, rs9712275 (PU.1 QTL p=2.11x10-18)
colocalised with Crohn’s disease and was also associated with active marks, H3K4me3
(p=3.91x10-22) and H3K27ac (p=1.05x10-19) as well as the repressive mark H3K27me3
(p=1.57x10-21). This locus is also a significant eQTL for the phospholipase C, epsilon (PLCL1)
gene (p=6.11x10-28). Interestingly, two associations were also significant in monocytes,
H3K27ac (p=4.75x10-15) and the PLCL1 eQTL (p=3.30x10-40). From our allele-specific
analysis, we identified that this locus showed evidence of allelic imbalance in PCHi-C
interactions for regions interacting with the PLCL1 baited gene. PLCL1 encodes the
phospholipase C epsilon or phospholipase C like I (inactive) signalling protein that has been
shown to be involved in receptor turnover but also inhibiting integrin activity 75,76 suggesting a
role in the regulation of cell trafficking. Combined these examples, and others, highlight a role
for PU.1 mediated regulatory cascade in moderating disease risk.
