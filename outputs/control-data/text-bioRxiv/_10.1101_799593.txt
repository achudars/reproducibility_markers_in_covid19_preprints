Abstract

38

Objective: Functional interconnections between brain regions define the ‘connectome’ which

39

is of central interest for understanding human brain function, and is increasingly recognized in

40

the pathophysiology of mental disorders. Previous resting-state functional magnetic resonance

41

(rsfMRI) work has revealed changes in static connectivity related to age, sex, cognitive

42

abilities and psychiatric symptoms, yet little is known how these factors may alter the

43

information flow. The commonly used approach infers functional brain connectivity using

44

stationary coefficients yielding static estimates of the undirected connection strength between

45

two brain regions. Dynamic graphical models (DGMs) are a multivariate model with dynamic

46

coefficients reflecting directed temporal associations between network nodes, and can yield

47

novel insight into directed functional brain connectivity. Here, we aimed to validate the DGM

48

method and determine information flow across the brain connectome and its relationship to

49

age, sex, intellectual abilities and mental health.

50

Methods: We applied DGM to investigate patterns of information flow in data from 984

51

individuals from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and 10,249 individuals from the UK

52

Biobank.

53

Results: Our analysis replicated previously reported patterns of directed connectivity in

54

independent HCP and UK Biobank data, including that the cerebellum consistently receives

55

information from other networks. We show robust associations between information flow and

56

both age and sex for several connections, with strongest effects of age observed in the

57

sensorimotor network. No significant effects where found for intellectual abilities or mental

58

health.

59

Discussion: Our findings support the use of DGM as a measure of directed connectivity in

60

rsfMRI data and provide new insight into the shaping of the connectome during aging.

Introduction

64

Although the rates and trajectories vary substantially between individuals and cognitive

65

domains (Ardila, 2007), normal aging is primarily associated with a decline in most cognitive

66

functions, including executive functions, attention, memory and perception (Riddle, 2007).

67

Numerous studies have established pronounced age-related differences in brain network

68

connections (Betzel et al., 2014; Cassady et al., 2019; Dørum et al., 2017; Geerligs, Renken,

69

Saliasi, Maurits, & Lorist, 2015; Grady, Springer, Hongwanishkul, McIntosh, & Winocur,

70

2006; Maglanoc, Kaufmann, van der Meer, et al., 2019; Meunier, Achard, Morcom, &

71

Bullmore, 2009; Wang, Su, Shen, & Hu, 2012). However, so far mostly age-related network

72

changes have been studied using static functional connectivity, where connectivity strengths

73

are estimated from stationary coefficients and assumed not to change short-term during the

74

period of scan. Dynamic functional connectivity (i.e., time-varying connectivity) has been

75

studied to a lesser degree yet could yield new knowledge about connectivity direction, thereby

76

supplementing approaches for static connectivity with insight into the information flow of

77

neural activity, underlying processes related to cognitive functions and mental health

78

(Hutchison et al., 2013).

79

There are various approaches to estimate connectivity direction, often divided into

80

effective connectivity and directed functional connectivity (K. Friston, Moran, & Seth, 2013).

81

Effective connectivity refers to the causal influence that one node exerts over another

82

(Bielczyk et al., 2019; K. J. Friston, 2011), while directed functional connectivity (dFC)

83

denotes information flow between nodes by estimating statistical interdependence using

84

measured blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) responses (Bielczyk et al., 2019). Recent

85

work has provided evidence of changes in connectivity direction with age. For instance, one

86

study noted posture-related changes in effective connectivity with elderly compared to

87

younger participants showing higher effective connectivity between the prefrontal cortex

88

(PFC) and the motor cortex (MC) as measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy

89

(fNIRS) while standing (Huo et al., 2018). Studies have also reported age-related

90

psychomotor slowing with higher effective connectivity (Michely et al., 2018), in addition to

91

changes in effective connectivity in certain areas of the brain of elderly APOE ε4 carriers

92

(Luo et al., 2019). It has also been shown that there are alterations in effective connectivity in

93

the prefrontal cortex during emotion processing in individuals with autism spectrum disorders

94

(Wicker et al., 2008), and disrupted effective connectivity in patients with externalizing

95

behavior disorders (Shannon, Sauder, Beauchaine, & Gatzke-Kopp, 2009), schizophrenia

96

(Schlösser et al., 2003) and depression (Lu et al., 2012; Rolls et al., 2018). Others have

97

investigated effective connectivity in relation to psychedelics and found evidence for

98

alterations in cortico-striato-thalamic-cortico loops in individuals given LSD (Preller et al.,

99

2019). Changes in effective connectivity have also been observed in relation to episodic

100

simulation and social cognition (Pehrs, Zaki, Taruffi, Kuchinke, & Koelsch, 2018), as well as

101

memory function in a neurodevelopmental sample (Riley et al., 2018). However, how the

102

information flow between nodes in the functional brain connectome is associated as a whole

103

with age, sex, cognition and mental health has yet to be delineated.

104

Dynamic graphical models (DGM) is a form of Dynamic Bayesian Networks, which

105

describes the instantaneous directed relationships between nodes (Bilmes, 2010; Schwab et

106

al., 2018). From this, one can study the spatiotemporal arrangement of links in the network,

107

defined here as the directionality between a node pair. This statistical method can give a

108

meaningful characterization of the dynamic connectivity between network nodes. Initial

109

implementation and validation of the approach in resting-state functional magnetic resonance

110

(rsfMRI) data from mice (N=16) and humans (N=500) (Schwab et al., 2018) suggested

(VM) and visual lateral (VL) networks in human rsfMRI. Here, we aimed to replicate these

114

findings using independent data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP, (Van Essen et

115

al., 2013)) and the UK Biobank (Sudlow et al., 2015). In addition, we extended the analysis to

116

examine if there were associations between dFC and age, age², sex, intellectual abilities and

117

mental health measures. We tested these associations for every connection of the directed

118

network (edge-level analysis), and on node-level by assessing associations with network

119

balance (the number of output connections divided by the number of input connections, for a

120

given node).

Methods

123

Study samples

124

HCP: The HCP consortium is funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) led by

125

Washington University, University of Minnesota, and Oxford University. HCP is undertaking

126

a systematic effort to map macroscopic human brain circuits and their relationship to behavior

127

in a large population of young healthy adults (Van Essen et al., 2013). HCP participants are

128

drawn from a healthy population born in Missouri, in the age range of 22–35 years, where a

129

proportion of the subjects included are adult twins and their non-twin siblings (Van Essen et

130

al., 2013). The adult sample consists of 1200 subjects. Exclusion criteria include having

131

siblings with severe neurodevelopmental disorders, documented neuropsychiatric or

132

neurologic disorders. Furthermore, individuals with illnesses such as diabetes or high blood

133

pressure and twins born prior to 34 weeks’ gestation and non-twins born prior to 37 weeks’

134

gestation were excluded (Van Essen et al., 2013). The participants went through an MRI

135

protocol, in addition to extensive behavioral assessment outside the scanner, in the domains of

136

cognitive, emotional, motor, and sensory functions (Van Essen et al., 2013). All participants

137

provided signed informed consent. Washington University Institutional Review Board

138

approved the study (Glasser et al., 2016).

139

UK Biobank: The UK Biobank initiative is a large-scale biobank prospective cohort

140

established by the Medical Research Council and Wellcome Trust (Collins, 2012), and funded

141

by the UK Medical Research Council, Wellcome Trust, Department of Health, British Heart

142

Foundation, Diabetes UK, Northwest Regional Development Agency, Scottish Government,

143

and Welsh Assembly Government (Sudlow et al., 2015). This population-based study

144

examines the influence of genetic and environmental factors and the occurrence of disease in

145

participants included in the age range of 40-69 years old, recruited from 2006-2010 and

146

assessed at 22 centers throughout the UK (Sudlow et al., 2015). The study has recruited

147

500 000 subjects, where 100 000 are going to be included as an MRI subgroup (Miller et al.,

148

2016). Further, participants filled out questionnaires about lifestyle, family, as well as medical

149

history in addition to completing a variety of physical measures (Sudlow et al., 2015). In

150

addition, a subset of participants filled in a mental health questionnaire (MHQ) online. All

151

participants provided signed informed consent. UK Biobank was approved by the National

152

Health Service National Research Ethics Service (ref 11/NW/0382, (Health Research

153

Authority, 2016)).

MR data was collected by the study teams of HCP and UK Biobank.

157

HCP: MRI data from the HCP study was collected using a customized 3T Siemens

158

Skyra with a 32-channel receive head coil at Washington University, US. Resting- state

159

blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI data was collected for each subject using a

plane FOV = 208 × 180 mm, fat sat, 1200 volumes; scan time ≈ 15min per rsfMRI session (in

163

total 4 rsfMRI sessions = 4800 volumes)(Smith et al., 2013). A T1-weighted 3D MPRAGE,

164

sagittal sequence with the following pulse sequence parameters was obtained: repetition time

165

(TR)/echo time (TE)/flip angle (FA) = 2.4ms/2.14ms/8°; voxel size = 0.7 × 0.7 × 0.7 mm,

166

FOV: 88×224×224, iPAT=2, scan time = 7min 40 sec. The T1-weighted image was used for

167

registration to the EPI data in the present study. rsfMRI data were collected over 2 days

168

divided into 4 rsfMRI sessions where the scanning session took 1 hour each of the days,

169

including task fMRI (Glasser et al., 2016).

170

UK Biobank: MR data from the UK Biobank study was collected with a 3T standard

171

Siemens Skyra using a 32-channel receive head coil at Newcastle and Cheadle Imaging

172

Centre in the UK. Resting- state blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI data was

173

collected for each subject using a T2*-weighted BOLD echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence

174

with the following parameters: TR/TE/FA = 735ms/39ms/52°; voxel size, 2.4×2.4×2.4 mm,

175

MB=8, R=1, no iPAT, fat sat, 490 volumes; scan time = 6min 10 sec. A T1-weighted 3D

176

MPRAGE, sagittal sequence with the following pulse sequence parameters was obtained:

177

repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE)/flip angle (FA) = 2.0ms/2.01ms/8°; voxel size = 1.0 × 1.0

178

× 1.0 mm, FOV: 208×256×256, in-plane acceleration iPAT=2, scan time = 5 min. The T1-

179

weighted image was used for registration to the EPI data in the present study. The entire MRI

180

protocol took 31 minutes in effective scan time (Miller et al., 2016).

187

processing tools, based on Smith et al. (2013), with minimal-preprocessing according to

188

Glasser et al. (2013). In addition, areal-feature-based alignment and the multimodal surface

189

matching algorithm was applied for inter-subject registration of the cerebral cortex (Glasser et

190

al., 2013; Robinson et al., 2014). Further, artefacts were removed by means of FIX (FMRIB’s

191

ICA-based X-noisiefier, (Griffanti et al., 2014; Salimi-Khorshidi et al., 2014)), and ICA

192

(independent component analysis, (Beckmann & Smith, 2004)) while dual regression was

193

used for further processing of timeseries, these steps are described in more detail below. HCP

194

structural data was manually quality checked while the fMRI data went through a built in

195

quality control pipeline where estimates including voxel-wise temporal standard deviation

196

(tSD), temporal SNR (tSNR), movement rotation and translation were computed (Marcus et

197

al., 2013). In addition, the BIRN Human QA tool was used (Glover et al., 2012; Marcus et al.,

198

2013). 184 subjects were reconstructed using an earlier version of the HCP data

199

reconstruction software, while 812 subjects were run through a later edition, and 7 subjects

200

was processed using a mixture of the two methods. Further, the data was temporally

201

demeaned and variance normalized (Beckmann & Smith, 2004). Next, fMRI datasets were

202

submitted to a group ICA, a data driven analysis technique used to discover independently

203

distributed spatial patterns that represent source processes in the data (Beckmann & Smith,

204

2004). ICA extracts spatially independent components, a set of spatial maps and associated

205

time courses, by use of blind signal source separation and linear decomposition of fMRI data

206

(McKeown et al., 1998; McKeown & Sejnowski, 1998). MIGP (MELODIC’s Incremental

207

Group-PCA) from 468 subjects were used to generate group-PCA that was used for the

208

group-ICA utilizing FSL’s Multivariate Exploratory Linear Optimized Decomposition into

209

Independent Components (MELODIC) tool (Beckmann & Smith, 2004; Hyvärinen, 1999),

210

where 25 components were extracted and used for further processing. ICA was applied in

211

grayordinate space (Glasser et al., 2013). Dual regression was applied to estimate specific

212

spatial maps and corresponding time series from the group ICA for each subject (Beckmann

213

& Smith, 2004; Filippini et al., 2009). As Schwab et al. (2018) showed consistency in dFC

214

between rsfMRI sessions, we included data from all 4 rsfMRI sessions in our analysis and as

215

such dual regression was applied on the subjects that had completed all four rsfMRI sessions.

216

UK Biobank: Processed data was accessed from the UK Biobank study team under

217

accession code 27412. The Biobank preprocessing comprised image processing tools, largely

218

acquired from FSL (http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk), and complied with the pre-processing steps

219

done as part of the HCP pipeline, including motion correction using MCFLIRT, grand-mean

220

intensity normalisation of the 4D dataset by a single multiplicative factor, high pass temporal

221

filtering and distortion correction (Alfaro-Almagro et al., 2018). The EPI unwarping step

222

included alignment to the T1, where the unwarped data is written out in native fMRI space,

223

while the transform to T1 space is written out independently (Alfaro-Almagro et al., 2018).

224

FMRIB’s Linear Image Registration tool (FLIRT) was used to register fMRI volumes to the

225

T1-weighted image (Mark Jenkinson, Bannister, Brady, & Smith, 2002; M. Jenkinson &

226

Smith, 2001). Boundary based registration (Greve & Fischl, 2009) was used in a final step to

227

refine the registration of the EPI and structural image. The ICA+FIX and dual regression

228

procedure corresponds to what we reported for HCP above. For the UK Biobank sample,

229

4100 fMRI datasets were submitted to a group ICA, where 25 components where extracted

230

from the ICA and used for further analysis. A FIX classifier for UK Biobank imaging data

231

was hand trained on 40 Biobank rsfMRI datasets for removal of artefacts (Alfaro-Almagro et

232

al., 2018). As for quality assessment, part of the UK Biobank imaging pipeline entails

233

assessment of the T1-weighted images, which includes automated classification by use of

234

machine learning (Alfaro-Almagro et al., 2018). If a T1-weighted image has been classified as

235

having serious issues, the dataset has not been used in this study.

237

Included participant data

238

HCP: From the HCP data release, four subjects were excluded due to missing information

239

about mean relative motion and 15 individuals were excluded due to missing information in

240

cognitive or mental health data, yielding data from a total of 984 individuals aged 22-37 years

241

(mean: 28.7 years, sd: 3.71 years, 52.8% females) for the analysis on all HCP subjects. Out of

242

those, data from 495 individuals were not included by Schwab et al. (2018) and were included

243

for an additional replication analysis (mean: 28.6 years, sd: 3.72 years, 49.5% females).

244

UK Biobank: From the UK Biobank data release, we started out with 16,975 subjects, where

245

we excluded subjects with a diagnosed neurological or psychiatric disorder (N=1,319) as well

246

as 5,082 subjects missing information on mean relative motion, cognitive and mental health

247

data, and 325 subjects that had a different number of volumes than in the standard protocol,

248

yielding data from a total of 10,249 individuals aged 40-70 years (mean: 55.4 years, sd: 7.37

249

years, 53.8% females).

250
251

Network analysis

252

For both HCP and UKB sample, we accessed the time series of decompositions performed

253

with 25 independent components. In each sample, we chose ten resting-state networks (RSNs)

254

that had the highest spatial correlation with the ten RSNs reported by Smith et al. (2009), and

255

in line with the procedure used in Schwab et al. (2018). These RSNs comprised default mode

256

(DMN), cerebellar (Cer), visual occipital (VO), visual medial (VM), visual lateral (VL), right

257

frontoparietal (FPR), left frontoparietal (FPL), sensorimotor (SM), auditory (Au), and

258

executive control (Ex) networks. The timeseries for the ten RSNs were mean centered so that

259

each timeseries for each node had a mean of zero. Finally, utilizing the DGM package v1.7.2

260

in R we estimated dFC from individual level RSN time series. RSNs will henceforth be

261

referred to as network “nodes” as we estimated temporal connectivity between RSNs.

262
263

Statistical analysis

264

For both HCP and UK Biobank data, we performed logistic regressions for every connection

265

of the directed network using directed connectivity as the response variable and testing for

266

associations with age, age², sex, intellectual abilities, mental health, motion and scanner site.

267

We refer to this as edge-level analysis. Furthermore, we assessed input and output

268

connections for a given network together, to examine the balance between a network’s sent

269

and received information. As such we calculated the ratio between the number of output

270

connections and the number of input connections for a given node, and we refer to this as

271

node-level analysis. To avoid inducing missing values when the denominator is 0, we added

272

0.5 to the dominator and nominator of dFC before taking the ratio (Sankey, Weissfeld, Fine,

273

& Kapoor, 1996). We performed linear regression using this balance as a dependent variable

274

and the same independent variables as used on the edge-level. All p-values were Bonferroni

275

corrected for a number of 90 analyses on the edge-level and for 10 analysis on the node-level.

276

For the HCP data, we used the age-adjusted NIH Toolbox Cognition Total Composite

277

Score as a measure of cognitive abilities, and the gender and age adjusted T-score of the

278

Achenbach Adult Self-Report, Syndrome Scales and DSM-Oriented Scale (ASR) as a

279

measure of mental health for the HCP participants. In addition, we calculated the mean of the

280

inferred mental health by performing a principal component analysis (PCA) on 14 items of

288

the online MHQ available for 154,607 participants with less than 3 missing values on the

289

included items (Figure 1). We imputed missing values in R using the missMDA package

290

(Josse & Husson, 2016) and subsequently performed the PCA using the “prcomp” function.

291

The first PC, often referred to as the p-Factor or pF (Caspi et al., 2013), explained 27.02% of

292

the variance. This component related mostly to depression/anxiety items. Given recent

293

indications that psychopathology may not be explained by a single dimension (Mallard et al.,

294

2019), we also included the second principal component, which explained 11.94% of the

295

variance. We refer to this component as pF2, and this component related mostly to psychosis

296

items. The statistical models tested in UK Biobank thus included age, age², sex, fluid

297

intelligence, pF, pF2, motion and scanning site where age is defined as poly(age,2).

Results

305

We uncovered the same pattern of dFC between networks as previously reported (Fig 2a,

306

Schwab et al., 2018), when using only data from independent subjects that were not used in

307

Schwab et al. (2018) (Fig 2b) and likewise when using all available HCP data (Fig 2c). The

308

cerebellar and auditory network appeared to be mostly a receiver in terms of directional

information flow in the network.

Analysis of edge-wise associations of dFC with age, age², sex, intellectual abilities, mental

328

health and motion in the full HCP sample (N=984) yielded significant effects after Bonferroni

329

correction (Figure 3). The findings show that compared to women, the VM in men receives

330

less information in general from the other nodes (fig.3; SI tables 1a-b provides z-scores and

331

corresponding p-values). Furthermore, the cerebellar node in men compared to women more

332

often received information from the other networks, the opposite of what was found for VM.

333

In addition, motion had significant impact on directed connectivity between the CER-VM and

334

for edges involving the cerebellar network, whereas age, age², intellectual abilities and mental

335

health, were not significantly associated with directed connectivity at the edge-level.

Node-level analysis reveals significant effects of age and sex on directed connectivity

338

Next, we assessed network balance. In line with results from the edge-wise analyses, we

339

found that sex was significantly associated with node balance of the VM network (t = 6.59,

340

PBonf =.038), with this network having more outputs than inputs in males, rendering this node

341

to send more information in males compared to females (Fig. 4a). In addition, there was a

342

significant relationship between the VM node and age (t = 2.9, PBonf <.001), where we

343

observed a higher balance with higher age, indicating that VM sends more information with

344

higher age. Further, when looking at the overall balance for the FPR we found that this node

345

sends more information to other nodes in females compared to males (t = -3.34, PBonf =.009;

346

Fig.4b). Additionally, the cerebellar network revealed a significant effect of sex where the

347

cerebellar network in females gives more information to other networks, compared to males

348

(Fig 4c; t = -4.27, PBonf <.001).

Schwab et al. (2018). Whereas the characteristic of the Au network to have many input

359

connections as found in HCP data did not replicate, UK Biobank data confirmed this pattern

360

for the cerebellum, as well as a bidirectionality of the VM-VL edge with these nodes having a

361

reciprocal information flow (Fig. 5).

374

We found a significant effect of age on edge-wise information flow with a positive

375

association for the VL, FPR and the cerebellar network, with these nodes giving more

376

information to the DMN with higher age. Further, with higher age the DMN gives more

377

information to the VL and Cer network, while the Ex receives more information from the

378

FPR, FPL and the SM (Fig.5; see SI for further details). Moreover, SM receives less

379

information in general from the other nodes and this node sends less information input in the

380

information flow with the cerebellar and auditory networks with higher age. In addition, VM

381

showed a pattern of less output connections, sending less information to the cerebellar

382

network and there was also a decrease in information flow from VO to FPL, VL-FPL and

383

FPR-FPL, and for the DMN and VL to the auditory network. In addition, there was an effect

384

of age², from CER to the FPR node.

385

Also, there was widespread significant associations between dFC and sex (fig.5; see SI

386

for further details), where the FPR, FPL, SM, CER, Au and Ex nodes in males more often

387

receive information in general from the other nodes compared to females. The opposite was

388

found for VO-VM, and there was bidirectional dFC between DMN and CER with reduced

389

information flow in both directions observed in males. In addition, there was a reciprocal

390

mutual relationship between the DMN and VM, with increased information flow in both

391

directions with higher age. Also, the DMN received more information input from Au and VO

392

in aging, while the SM node sent more information to the VO while the VL received more

393

information from the VO, SM and Cer with higher age.

399

<.001; Fig.6a), and the same relationship was found for the FPL node (t = -3.41, PBonf =.006).

400

In addition, there was a significant effect of age in both Au (t = 4.05, PBonf <.001) and FPL (t

401

= 3.11, PBonf =.02), with these two nodes giving more information to the other nodes with

402

higher age. Also, the Ex network showed a significant age and sex association, sending less

403

information to the other nodes with higher age (t = -4.17, PBonf <.001) and in males (t = -6.47,

404

PBonf <.001; Fig.6c). The VO network showed the same pattern in relation to aging (t = -3.73,

405

PBonf =.002), but the sex effects were here the opposite of what was found for the Ex network,

406

with the VO node showing a pattern of sending more information to the other nodes in males

407

compared to females (t = 4.33, PBonf <.001; Fig.6d). Further, the SM sends more information

408

with higher age (t = 7.12, PBonf <.001; fig.6e), and the VM network display significant sex

409

effects, with the balance indicating that this node sends more information to the other nodes

410

in males compared to females (t = 6.23, PBonf <.001; Fig.6g). In addition, there was a

411

significant association between age² and balance of the FPR network (t = -2.95, PBonf =.03;

412

Fig.6f).

413

Taken together, these findings indicate overall that nodes tend to send more

414

information in females, except when it comes to the visual networks, where these networks

415

send more information in males. We did not find any significant associations between node

416

balance and pF or cognitive test performance.

Discussion

424

The aim of the current study was to test for associations between dFC and age, age², sex,

425

cognitive abilities and mental health between core brain networks after validating the

426

approach in the HCP data (Schwab et al. (2018)). We performed the analysis in healthy

427

participants from two large public cohorts that differed in their age range (HCP: 22-37 years,

428

n= 984, UK Biobank: 40-70 years, n=10,249).

429

We replicated the patterns of dFC between networks in the HCP sample as previously

430

reported in Schwab et al. (2018). Both the HCP and UK Biobank samples confirmed that the

431

cerebellar network receives mostly rather than emits information from several other networks.

432

Further, the visual areas VM and VL showed a bi-directionality in the information flow of

433

their connectivity, with effects particularly pronounced in UK Biobank. Whereas the

434

previously reported (Schwab et al., 2018) patterns that the auditory network mostly receives

435

information from others replicated in the independent HCP analyses in the present study,

436

similar patterns were not observed in UK Biobank data. These differences may be attributable

437

to sample specific differences, such as the differences in the age range or differences in the

438

decomposition of the Au network.

439

We observed marked effects of age on dFC in UK Biobank sample. For example, the

440

sensorimotor network generally received little information from other networks with higher

441

age in the 40-70 years age range. This is particularly interesting given that dysconnectivity of

442

sensorimotor networks has previously been associated with schizophrenia (Cheng et al., 2015;

443

T. Kaufmann et al., 2015), and apparent aging of the brain appears a key characteristic in

444

schizophrenia (Hajek et al., 2019; Tobias Kaufmann et al., 2019; Schnack et al., 2016),

445

making it of interest to delineate how age-related effects play a part in healthy aging as well

446

as mental disorders.

447

Overall, most age effects were in the direction of decreased reception with higher age.

448

However, two connections showed a bi-directional relationship with age with decreased

449

connectivity flow in both directions between these nodes (Cer-SM, Au-SM). Additionally,

450

two connections of the DMN increased bi-directionally with age (Cer-DMN, DMN-VL). Of

451

note, increased static connectivity between the cerebellum and the DMN with age has

452

previously been reported in a study comparing a group of young to a group of old individuals

453

(Dørum et al., 2017). While connectivity was lower in the young group during rest, it was

454

higher in the young group during task load (Dørum et al., 2017), which is in line with the

455

established decline of DMN variability in old age (Maglanoc, Kaufmann, Jonassen, et al.,

456

2019; Mowinckel, Espeseth, & Westlye, 2012). Thus, changes in direction with age may also

457

depend on task load, which will need to be explored in future studies. Finally, when

458

examining dFC on the node-level, we observed in the HCP sample that the VM receives less

459

information in early adulthood (20-40 years), and that the SM sends more information input

460

later in life (40-70 years) in the UK Biobank sample.

461

The marked pattern of more inputs than outputs of the cerebellum, which replicated

462

across samples, showed significant sex differences at the edge- and node-level. Males

463

expressed this receiver pattern stronger than females. In contrast, the pattern of more inputs

464

than outputs of the VM appeared stronger in females, as observed at the edge- and node-level

465

in HCP data and at the node-level in UK Biobank data. There was also a pronounced effect of

466

sex on dFC in the sensorimotor network in UK Biobank data, with males showing a more

467

marked pattern of dFC compared to females on the edge-level. Prior research has reported

468

increased connectivity in males in the sensorimotor network in resting-state (Scheinost et al.,

469

2015) and both increased and decreased down regulation between males and females while

470

participants were performing a motor task (Lissek et al., 2007). These sex effects yield insight

471

into how sex factors into information flow of large-scale brain networks and can be of help in

22

472

giving a better understanding of the connectome in general and also for sex differences found

473

in symptom onset and burden in mental disorders.

474

Whereas our results revealed distinct effects of age and sex on dFC, none of our

475

analyses identified significant relations with individual differences in cognitive test

476

performance or mental health. However, other studies looking at patient groups in relation to

477

psychiatric disorders have observed alterations in connectivity direction with mental health

478

(Lu et al., 2012; Rolls et al., 2018; Schlösser et al., 2003; Shannon et al., 2009; Wicker et al.,

479

2008) and it should be noted that all included individuals in our study were healthy and thus

480

the variations related to mental health was small, making it difficult to detect associations.

481

Also, the tools taken to assess mental health may to some degree also have had an impact on

482

the null findings. The MHQ in UK Biobank was taken a long time after the scanning and it

483

may thus not be a solid marker of the state at the participants’ time of scanning. Likewise, due

484

to differences in available data, we used different approaches for measuring mental health,

485

estimating two principal components in UK Biobank and utilizing a sum score in the HCP

486

data. Also, the ASR item used to measure psychiatric and life function in HCP may not be

487

specific enough as it represents a sum score of a range of domains extending to depression

488

and anxiety, aggressive behavior, attentional problems and hyperactivity, personality traits,

489

psychotic and abnormal behavior, risk taking and impulsivity, somatic complaints, and

490

substance use.

491
492

Limitations

493

There are limitations in the current study. The data was processed in different pipelines and

494

we thus chose not to analyze the two samples together as would have been of interest for

495

studying age effects across the lifespan. While we observed various patterns across the two

496

independent cohorts, there were also marked differences that might be partly attributable to

23

497

confound effects, such as variability in the ICA decompositions, scanning site and motion. Of

498

note, while confounders showed significant effects on dFC, they are unlikely to explain the

499

main findings. For example, the reported pattern of the cerebellum was observed in both HCP

500

and UK Biobank data, yet only in HCP data the cerebellum also showed motion confounds.

501

Moreover, DGM estimates connections binary, which may have rendered the association

502

analyses less sensitive. In addition, DGM requires high-quality fMRI data with a low TR and

503

benefits from a high number of observations. The long scan duration needed to acquire such

504

data may have increased the chance that participants may fall asleep while they are being

505

scanned. This is especially a challenge for the HCP project were participants are in the MRI

506

scanner for a long time period (Glasser et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018). The lack of variation

507

and low number limited the ability to investigate association with cognitive and mental health

508

measures. Future research, involving patients with psychiatric disorders may reveal if and

509

how information flow is associated with disorders or related to specific symptoms.

510
511

Conclusions

512

In conclusion, using the rsfMRI data from extended HCP as well as the UK Biobank samples

513

we replicated several of the directed connectivity patterns from the original HCP analysis

514

(Schwab et al., 2018). In particular we observed a marked characteristic of the cerebellar

515

network to receive directed edges from many areas, and the visual areas VM and VL showed

516

a bi-directionality in the information flow of their connectivity. Further, there was widespread

517

age and sex effects on information flow, where strong age effects where observed in the

518

sensorimotor network. Our findings support the use of DGM as a measure of directed

519

connectivity in rsfMRI data and uncovered new insight into the shaping of the connectome in

520

aging. Future studies should examine dFC in other samples and look at directional changes in

521

connectivity in relation to clinical populations and in broader age ranges.
