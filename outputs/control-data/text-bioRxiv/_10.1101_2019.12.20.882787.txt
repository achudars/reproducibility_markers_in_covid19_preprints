Abstract

15

Bovine digital dermatitis (DD), is a highly prevalent disease among dairy cattle

16

characterized by ulcerative and painful lesions. While multiple risk factors are involved

17

in the disease, its precise etiology remains unclear and the effectiveness of the current

18

control strategies still highly variable. However, and even if the main role of Treponema

19

spp. in the development of the disease is consistently recognized, the importance of

20

other bacterial communities and the factors affecting the skin environment remains

21

uncertain. The objective of this study was to investigate the dynamics of microbiotas

22

from feet affected by DD, before and after the implementation of disinfectant footbaths

23

under field conditions. During this investigation, the diversity, structure, and

24

composition of microbiotas from DD lesions over time were explored according to

25

different clinical factors. The findings of this investigation confirmed a particular

26

microbiota related to DD lesions dominated by Treponema spp. and highly different

27

from those microbiotas of healthy skin. However, the diversity and structure of

28

microbiotas from DD lesions did not vary according to the usage of footbaths or

29

individual topical antibiotic treatments. Otherwise, microbiotas from proliferative

30

lesions evidenced a different structure and diversity in comparison to non-proliferative

31

lesions. The composition of microbiotas changed over time revealing the potential main

32

role of Treponema spp., Fusobacterium spp., Mycoplasma spp. and Porphyromonas

33

spp. in the dynamics of DD lesion progression. Further studies are necessaries to

34

confirm if the clinical evolution of DD lesions is driven by a particular microbiota and

35

how this microbiota induces disease.

Highlights

40

Multiple bacteria have been identified in DD lesions. However, a large part of these

41

microorganisms are inhabitants of the foot skin and the farm environment. For the first

42

time, the microbiotas of DD lesions were followed over 45 days under field conditions

43

to explore their evolution over time and how footbaths practices may affect their

44

dynamics. The results of this investigation confirmed a particular microbiota related to

45

DD lesions dominated by Treponema spp. and highly different from those microbiotas

46

of healthy skin. The microbiotas from DD lesions evolved over the study period and

47

the differential bacteria were identified. Further studies are guaranteed to determine

48

the role of the bacteria composing these microbiotas on the lesion occurrence and its

49

outcome.

Introduction

52

The increased prevalence of lameness and its impact on the welfare and productivity

53

of animals reflects an important concern facing modern dairy farming. One of the main

54

causes of infectious lameness is bovine digital dermatitis (DD)1, a multifactorial and

55

polymicrobial disease spread across the world and characterized by ulcerative and

56

painful lesions which might persist as a chronic condition. DD lesions progress in

57

dynamic ways conditioned by multiple environmental factors that influence the spread

58

of associated-pathogens and the integrity of the foot skin. Currently, the control

59

strategies implemented in dairy farms such as footbaths or individual treatments, have

60

demonstrated variable effectiveness in the healing and prevention of DD lesions2,3.

61

Although the precise etiology of DD remains unclear, the maceration of the foot skin

62

and the presence of Treponema spp. have been consistently identified as the major

63

etiological components of DD4–7. However, multiple other bacteria have also been

64

associated with DD infection in different studies, such as Mycoplasma spp.8,9;

65

Fusobacterium necrophorum10; some Bacteroides, specifically Porphyromonas levii

66

11,12;

different Proteobacteria, such as Campylobacter spp. and Dichelobacter nodosus

67

13–15,

and finally a broad range of other Firmicutes16. Nevertheless, the large part of

68

these DD-associated pathogens (including the Treponema spp.) are inhabitants of the

69

foot skin, the rumen, and the gastrointestinal tract of ruminants, and thereby, of the

70

farm environment 17–19. Together, all these findings have reinforced the concept of DD

71

as a polymicrobial disorder suggesting that a particular microbiota may drive the lesion

72

environment and affect its outcome.

73

The development of collective and individual treatment strategies has been focused

74

on the incriminate DD associated-pathogens, mainly against Treponema spp.

75

Nevertheless, these treatments influence the structure of the microbial communities

76

that constitute the foot skin barrier. The disruption of the skin microbiota can lead to

77

dysbiosis and consequently induce colonization of DD-associated pathogens and the

78

consequent apparition of DD lesions. Hypothetically, a successful control strategy

79

should regulate microbiota for preventing or decreasing the proliferation of the DD-

80

associated pathogens.

81

Next-generation sequencing had enlarged the perspectives to explore deeply the

82

dynamics of the entire skin microbiota, beyond the restrictions imposed by the culture

83

of pathogens or the pre-selection of targeted species. Through the sequencing

84

analysis of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), this investigation explored the dynamics of

85

DD microbiota over time and the short-term effects of a new disinfectant footbath

86

biocide on the DD microbiotas gathered from the foot skin of 10 diseased cows from 5

87

different dairy farms followed over 45 days.

Results

90

The clinical evolution of the lesions according to the lesion type and the M5 scoring

91

are presented in Table 1. Regarding the lesion type recorded, by the end of the study

92

period, the number of proliferative lesions remained unchanged in the footbath group

93

and only one additional proliferative lesion was recorded in the control group.

94

Independent of the allocation group, none of the DD lesions evidenced a transition to

95

a healing or healthy status (M3-M0). Before the study start, 2 of the feet allocated in

96

the control group received a topic antibiotic treatment (12 and 21 days, respectively).

97

During the study period, 3 feet from the control group, were treated with topic antibiotic

98

treatment at days 17, 35 and 39, respectively, and one foot from the footbath group

99

was treated on day 17.

100

According to the histologic evaluation of epidermal damage, the 10 samples of healthy

101

skin were considered at score 1 and most of the DD lesions were considered at score

102

3 (n=32), as expected (Table 1). The lesions considered at EDS 3 were systematically

103

associated with bacterial invasion of spirochaetal origin (Figure 1), whereas lesions at

104

EDS 2 seemed less frequently associated with bacterial invasion (BIS=1 (n=3), BIS=2

105

(n=3), and BIS=3 (n=1)) (Table 1). Otherwise, samples considered at EDS 1 were

106

never associated with bacterial invasion. While during the study, all 10 initial DD lesions

107

studied remained among the clinical stages M2, M4 or M4.1, 4 of those lesions

108

presented the lowest BIS (2 allocated at the nT group). Likewise, only two DD lesions

109

(M4 and M3) were considered at EDS 1.

110
111

From the raw reads processing, 1571 non-chimeric unique amplicon sequence

112

variants (ASV) were identified. After removing low prevalence ASV occurring in less

113

than two samples, 1398 ASV were conserved. Finally, the phylogenetic tree-based

114

agglomeration conducted to the identification of 139 unique ASV including 8 uniquely

115

named taxa on the phylum level and 24 on the genus level (Figure 1S). The set of

116

microbial proxies studied according to every sampling time are presented in Table 1.

117

For the within-group comparisons, no noticeable differences were found in any of the

118

microbial proxies studied before footbath implementation (Healthy skin at day 0 Vs. DD

119

lesion at day 0), or during the study (day 0 Vs. day 15; day 0 Vs. day 30; day 0 Vs. day

120

45). Likewise, no between-group differences (nT Vs. T) were found in any of the

121

microbial proxies studied between healthy skins, or between DD lesions at day 0, day

122

15, day 30 or day 45. However, when comparing all the microbiotas of healthy skin to

123

those of DD lesions from day 0 (independent of the allocation group), noticeable

124

differences were detected between the microbiotas evenness (p = 0.001), diversity (p

125

= 0.001), and dissimilarity (p = 0.027). Furthermore, when comparing together the

126

microbiotas from DD lesion collected at day 45 to all those from day 0, noticeable

127

differences were detected in all the microbial proxies studied. When comparing DD

128

lesions over time, noticeable differences were only detected for the evenness at every

129

sample time comparison studied (day 0 Vs. day 15; day 0 Vs. day 30; day 0 Vs. day

130

45).

131

According to the clinical variables explored and the histological evaluation, no

132

differences in the richness were detected for any of the comparisons (Table 2).

133

Likewise, the usage of footbaths or IndTx did not affect the microbiota's evenness,

134

diversity or dissimilarity. Otherwise, proliferative lesions presented decreased

135

dissimilarity and increased evenness and diversity in comparison to non-proliferative

136

lesions. The DD lesions considered at M2, M4 or M4.1 stages did not differ between

137

them in any of the microbial proxies studied. However, healthy skin microbiotas had

138

noticeably higher evenness, diversity, and dissimilarity in comparison to any other

139

lesion. Similarly, microbiotas from samples considered at the lowest scores according

140

to the BIS and EDS, had noticeably higher evenness, diversity, and dissimilarity (Table

141

2).

142
143

Regarding the composition of the microbiota, the most frequent phylum found among

144

the healthy skin samples were Firmicutes (41.98%), Actinobacteria (17.80%),

145

Spirochaetes

146

Otherwise, before the start of the study, the most frequent phylum found in DD lesions

147

were Spirochaetes (44.43%), Bacteroidetes (29.95%), Firmicutes (14.16%), and

148

Tenericutes (8.27%) (Figure S1).

150

The evolution over time of the DD lesion microbiotas is presented in figure S2. The

151

microbiotas from healthy skin at day 0 and DD lesions at day 45 have a more disperse

152

configuration compared to the other time points (Figure S2 A). Nevertheless, when

153

comparing all-time points together, no visual differences or cluster formations were

154

evidenced (Figure S2 B).

155

The figure 2A displays the microbiotas according to the usage or not of footbath

156

disinfectants during the study period (DD samples from Day 15 until the end of the

157

study). Both microbiotas seem to share a similar cluster, however Fusobacterium spp.

158

are placed outside the cluster in DD lesions that did not receive the footbath

159

disinfectant. Comparing the samples from feet that received an IndTx during the

160

interval before the next biopsy (from day 0) with those that did not receive any IndTx,

161

the samples seem to share the same cluster (figure 2B). However, among the treated

162

samples, Fusobacterium spp. is completely separated from the cluster formed by the

163

remaining bacteria. The scatter plot of the lesion type suggests distinctive clusters for

164

proliferative and non-proliferative lesions, though both microbiotas have a similar

165

structure (Figure 2C). Finally, according to the clinical score, a large part of the healthy

166

skin microbiotas seems to separate from the cluster formed by DD lesions. The M4.1

167

lesions are placed in the middle of M2 and M4 lesions. (Figure 2D). Otherwise,

168

according to the histological evaluation, scores 0 and 1 seems to group separately

169

from scores 2 and 3 when comparing bacterial invasion scores (Figure S3 A). Likewise,

170

score 1 and 2 seems to group separately from score 3 when comparing epidermal

171

damage scores (Figure S3 B).

172
173

Finally, the dynamics of DD microbiota composition were explored through a

174

differential abundance analysis (Figures 3 and 4). Regarding the baseline comparison

175

between healthy skin and DD lesions at day 0, 55 ASV noticeably changed in the

176

control group and 70 ASV in the footbath group, and between both groups, they share

177

27 common ASV. In both groups, DD lesions at day 0 have i) increased abundances

178

of Treponema spp., Mycoplasma spp., Fretibacterium spp. and Campylobacter spp.

179

and ii) decreased abundances of Porphyromonas spp. In the control group, while

180

Fusobacterium spp. abundances increased, those of Corynebacterium spp. and other

181

unidentified Actinobacteria decreased. In the footbath group, while Prevotella spp.

182

abundances increased, those of Fusobacterium spp. change in both directions.

183

Otherwise, when comparing the abundances of DD samples from day 15 to those of

184

day 0 in the control group, it was observed the increase of Fusobacterium spp. and the

185

decrease of Acholeplasma spp., Porphyromonas spp. and other unidentified

186

Bacteriodetes and Firmicutes. Otherwise, for the same same time comparison, in the

187

footbath group the abundances of Campylobacter spp., Treponema spp., other

188

Spirochaetes, and other Actinobacteria decreased, while those of Fusobacterium spp.

189

increased. For the same time comparison, the abundances of Porphyromonas spp.

190

and the other unidentified Bacteriodetes and Firmicutes varied inconsistently. For the

191

comparison between day 30 and day 15, in the control group abundances of

192

Fusobacterium spp., Porphyromonas spp., Corynebacterium spp. and other

193

unidentified Actinobacteria noticeably increased, while those of Mycoplasma spp. and

194

Acholeplasma spp. decreased and those of Treponema spp. varied inconsistently.

195

Otherwise, for the same time comparison in the footbath group, abundances of

196

Acholeplasma spp., Porphyromonas spp., Treponema spp., and other Spirochaetes

197

and Actinobacteria increased, while those of Mycoplasma decreased. For the

198

comparison between day 45 and day 30, in the control group the abundances of

199

Acholeplasma spp., Fretibacterium spp., and Prevotella spp. increased, while those of

200

Treponema spp. and Fusobacterium decreased, and those of the unidentified

201

Bacteriodetes and Firmicutes varied inconsistently. Finally, for the same time

202

comparison in the footbath group, abundances of Mycoplasma spp. and Prevotella

203

spp. increased, while Acholeplasma spp. decreased. Additionally, independent of the

204

allocation group, from day 30 until the end of the study, the abundances of unidentified

205

Bacteriodetes and Firmicutes varied inconstantly. Although the abundances of the

206

aforementioned bacteria presented noticeable changes among the time points studied,

207

however, some bacteria presented noticeable changes at specific time points (Figure

208

209
210

Discussion

211

The present investigation describes the differences between microbiotas from healthy

212

skin and those affected by DD lesions under field conditions. Additionally, for the first

213

time, the microbiota dynamics within affected feet were investigated during a period of

214

45 days measuring the impact of recognized factors, such as the usage of footbath

215

disinfectants. As expected, the microbiotas from DD lesions were dominated by

216

Treponema spp. and their configuration was largely different from those from healthy

217

skin microbiotas in terms of diversity, structure, and composition. Among the

218

microbiotas of DD lesions, noticeable changes were evidenced between the samples

219

at day 0 and those obtained at day 45. However, neither the usage of footbath

220

disinfectants nor IndTx seemed noticeably impact the general diversity and structure

221

of microbiotas. Otherwise, the microbiotas from non-proliferative lesions were

222

noticeably different from those of proliferative lesions. From the findings of this

223

investigation, a dynamic evolution was evidenced on the abundances of Treponema

224

spp., Fusobacterium spp., Mycoplasma spp. and Porphyromonas spp. during the 45

225

days of follow-up. Changes in the microbiota composition over time varied according

226

to the usage or not of footbaths. This investigation demonstrates for the first time how

227

microbiotas from DD lesions change over time under field conditions.

228

Our findings support the polymicrobial nature of DD highlighted in previous

229

investigations based on metagenomics approaches and are in line with previous

230

findings signaling Treponema spp. as the microorganism most related to DD lesions in

231

comparison to healthy skin5,8,9. Moreover, the skin microbiotas gathered in this study

232

partially share the same structure of microbiotas previously investigated on healthy

233

skin and DD lesions from dairy cattle

234

lesions in previous investigations that were again identified by our findings include:

235

Treponema spp., Acholeplasma spp., Fusobacterium spp.5,8,9, Porphyromonas spp.,

236

Prevotella spp.12, Corynebacterium spp.9, Tissierella spp., Mycoplasma spp.8,

237

unclassified Bacteriodetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria11,12,20.

238

bacteria previously associated with DD, such as Dichelobacter nodosus

239

related in this study to the lesions. Furthermore, the present study identified

240

Fretibacterium spp. an anaerobic bacteria not previously involved with DD but related

241

to human periodontitis, a disease that as well is associated with Treponemas spp.22.

242

Although notably changes in the abundances of Fretibacterium spp. were identified in

243

microbiotas from DD lesions in comparison to those from healthy skin, the identification

244

of this specific genus might be linked to regional particularities of the farms sampled.

245

However, being the first skin microbiotas assembled from dairy cattle in France, no

246

regional comparison can be done. Additionally, the fact that previous studies have not

247

linked this bacteria genus to DD lesions might be explained by the original statistical

248

procedures implemented in the analyses of our present study. Indeed, the relative

249

abundances of every sample were calculated after the standardization of the observed

5,20.

In detail, the main bacteria linked to DD

250

taxonomic groups according to their variance and not through procedures implemented

251

previously such as the rough normalization which may entail the loss of valuable

252

information23. In detail, when using rough normalization procedures for data analyses,

253

information from samples with a scarce number of sequences is excluded from the

254

dataset. In specific cases, such as healthy skin samples, the exclusion of this

255

information may conduct to neglect the healthy nature of the sample which should have

256

low numbers of sequences in comparison to diseased samples. The within cow design

257

of this study offered the possibility of exploring the dynamics of microbiotas according

258

to the clinical evolution of each animal. Indeed, the simple comparison between

259

microbiotas from DD lesions obtained from different animals at diverse states may

260

underestimate or neglect the impact of individual and environmental factors (i.e. foot

261

conformation or barn hygiene) on the clinical outcome of lesions and their microbial

262

configuration.

263
264

One of the main limitations of this study was related to the difficulties encountered in

265

interpreting microbiotas obtained from an anatomical region which inevitably is in close

266

contact with the ground and thereby with dirtiness. Indeed, the distinction of pathogens

267

among environmental microorganisms is a challenge. Furthermore, colonization by

268

opportunistic pathogens could be favored by the successive incisional biopsies

269

performed during the follow-up of the lesions. Another limitation of the present

270

investigation was related to the small sample size studied. Larger samples may

271

highlight with more precision the benefit of control strategies for DD in increasing the

272

microbiota diversity of the skin. As several risk factors at the farm level are involved

273

with the disease, such as hygienic conditions, differences in the microbial profile

274

according to the farms were expected. However, the small number of farms (n=5) and

11

275

the small number of individuals sampled within farm restrain the exploration of factors

276

related to farm hygiene. Otherwise, while in this study the changes evidenced in the

277

microbiota allowed the clear distinction between diseased (M2-4-4.1) and healthy

278

states (M0), differences between allocation groups were not detected. Therefore, the

279

potential usefulness of this tool for measuring any effectiveness of control strategies

280

seemed inferior or at least different to standard observational methodologies such as

281

DD stages or lameness scoring. In terms of ethics, feasibility, and more importantly

282

precision, invasive methodologies (biopsies) are limited in large samples and, as

283

pointed above, entails a challenge for the interpretation. Another point concerns the

284

fact that the effect of footbath and IndTx could be highly affected by the exacerbated

285

anti-inflammatory response of the animals after each biopsy. Therefore, measuring

286

local immune responses may enhance the precision of the true effect of control

287

interventions. Regarding the histological evaluation of the samples, this additional

288

assessment clearly allowed the distinction of the bacterial invasion advance between

289

the samples. Although BSI was in concordance with the clinical evaluation of the

290

samples and the dynamic evolution of the microbiota abundances, the EDS results

291

were more difficult to interpret due to the potential effect of the recurrent biopsy

292

procedures. Lastly, the washing and scrubbing procedures performed during the

293

biopsy procedures might have modified the skin microbiota.

294
295

Among the different clinical factors studied, the structure and diversity of microbiotas

296

from DD lesions were not affected by the usage of IndTx. This could be explained by

297

the short and not persistent effect of this strategy over time24. Otherwise, the findings

298

of this study indicate noticeable differences between the microbiotas of non-

299

proliferative and proliferative DD lesions. The presence of proliferative tissues is

associated with chronical processes and thereby to lesions prone to relapse

The

301

hyper-proliferation of tissues surrounding the lesion may alter the environment of the

302

skin and the topical activity of footbath and IndTx26–28, thus influencing a distinctive

microbiota. Recently, Treponemas spp. have been related to some non-infectious

304

diseases inducing lameness29. Further studies are needed to evaluate the role of

305

microbiota in the dynamics of those non-infectious lesions that are related to the same

306

risk factors recognized for DD. Other recognized factors influencing the occurrence of

307

DD lesions at individual level, such as parity or days in milk, were not studied due to

308

the small number of cows evaluated at every time point and the large variability among

309

them.

310
311

Beyond the recognition of the pathogenic role of some specific bacteria, exploring the

312

microbiotas from DD lesions at the community level may highlight how the dynamics

313

of skin microbiota determine the persistence and the occurrence of DD lesions. Indeed,

314

the 16S rRNA gene analyses may capture broad shifts in community diversity over

315

time, but with limited resolution and lower sensitivity compared to metagenomic data.

316

Nevertheless, the results of this investigation reveal the dynamic nature of microbiotas

317

from DD lesions and highlight the potential importance of specific bacteria in the

318

progress of the lesions over time. Future studies may benefit from shotgun sequencing

319

tools, enhancing the sensibility in the recognition of pathogens and inhabitants and

320

their specific role in the disease. Therefore, further investigations linking the skin

321

microbiota to different herd management practices might enhance the current

322

understanding of the disease and promote the development of successful control

323

strategies.

325

In conclusion, we have described the dynamics of the skin microbiota in feet affected

326

with DD lesions. The diversity and structure of microbiotas from DD lesions were

327

different from those of healthy skin but did not vary according to the usage of footbaths

328

or IndTx. Otherwise, microbiotas from proliferative lesions evidenced a different

329

structure and diversity in comparison to non-proliferative lesions. The composition of

330

microbiotas changed over time revealing the potential main role of Treponema spp.,

331

Fusobacterium spp., Mycoplasma spp. and Porphyromonas spp. in the dynamics of

332

DD lesion progression. Further studies are needed to understand how risk factors

333

associated with DD at farm and individual levels may affect the interactions between

334

the bacteria composing the skin microbiota, and how these interactions may determine

335

the clinical evolution of DD lesions.

Methods

338

Ethics statement

339

The research protocol was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Veterinary Committee

340

in Clinical Research and Epidemiology from the Veterinary School of Nantes, ONIRIS,

341

France (CERVO, France) (registered number: CERVO-2016-12-V).

342
343

Study population

344

Five dairy farms were included in the study. The herds were composed exclusively of

345

Holstein cows to limit the putative breed effect, and on average 90 cows were milked

346

twice a day. The herds were housed in cubicles and the prevalence of active DD

347

lesions at the start of the study ranged from 20% to 40%. Cows were milked in a

348

rotatory or conventional milking-parlor.

350

These recruited farms participated simultaneously in a controlled clinical trial which

351

evaluates the effectiveness of a footbath solution on the control of DD lesions

352

solution administered in footbaths was a biocide composed by lactic acid (30%; w/w)

353

and glycolic acid (10%; w/w) as active substances (Pink-Step™, Qalian, France).

354

During the trial, each farm implemented a split-footbath which allowed to concurrently

355

administer the Pink-step™ solution through one side of the footbath whilst the other

356

side of the footbath remained empty and was used as a control. The frequency of

357

administration was of 2 days (4 consecutive milkings) every week. Additionally, farmers

358

were allowed to detect and then treat individually the severe cases of DD by using 2

359

applications of oxytetracycline (30 mg/ml) (Oxytetrin™, MSD Animal Health/Intervet,

360

France)) 2 days apart. For the current investigation, from each farm, the owners have

361

chosen two animals suffering from a DD lesion. Therefore, the study population

362

consisted of 10 different affected feet from 10 different cows, 5 of those feet belonged

363

to the control side (no disinfectant) and the remaining 5 to the footbath solution side,

364

allowing to explore the putative short-term effects of the footbath solution on the skin

365

microbiota composition. The sampled cows were between their first and fifth parity,

366

and their days in milk ranged from 3 to 378 at the start of the study.

30.

The

367
368

Follow-Up and Data Collection

369

Farms were visited by 2 investigators trained by practical lessons to practice the

370

biopsies. To perform the biopsies every cow was carefully restrained in a trimming

371

chute. The skin of the concerned foot was washed with water and then local anesthesia

372

was provided using Procaine 2% (Procamidor™, Axience, France). Thereafter, the foot

373

skin was rinsed and brushed with a PBS solution before to perform the sample with a

374

sterile biopsy punch (6 mm). The incisional samples were again washed with sterile

375

PBS solution, cut tangentially into two approximately equal parts. One half was stored

376

in 10% neutral buffered formalin solution for histological evaluation, and the other half

377

was stored in sterile 2.0 ml microcentrifuge tubes at -20°C for DNA extraction and

378

sequencing analysis. Finally, an aerosol bandage of aluminum (Aluspray™,

379

Vetoquinol, France) was sprayed directly over the incisional biopsy wound of each

380

cow. Additionally, in the case of pain detected by farmers, NSAIDs were provided after

381

the biopsy sampling.

382
383

The biopsy sampling began immediately before the start of the footbath trial. During

384

the first sampling and at this unique occasion each cow was sampled twice at the same

385

foot, one skin sample on the healthy area free of any DD lesion, and the second skin

386

sample directly on the DD lesion. Thereafter, during the following 3 visits, single DD

387

lesion biopsies were sampled at intervals of 15 days to allow the partial healing of the

388

skin. The location of each biopsy intended to be sampled approximately closer or over

389

the site where the precedent sample was taken. In total, each animal was sampled 4

390

times during the study period of 45 days. Thus, at the end of the study, a total of 50

391

biopsies were recovered, 25 from affected feet allocated to the control untreated group

392

(nT) and 25 from affected feet allocated to the footbath treatment group (T). All lesions

393

sampled were photographed and scored using the M5 score system28. Records of

394

every lesion include the information relative to the farm and cow characteristics and

395

specifically if any concomitant treatment was administered between the samplings.

396
397

Histopathology

398

The paraffin sections of every tissue sample were stained with Hematoxylin-Eosin-

399

Safran (HES) for the general histopathological evaluation and with Warthin Starry

400

Silver (WSS) to evaluate the presence and degree of spirochaetal invasion. The

401

degree of epidermal damage (EDS) was assessed according to a modified score

402

system described in a previous study14. A score of 1 was defined as normal skin or

403

presenting mild acanthosis and hyperkeratosis without any other significant

404

microscopic lesions associated and without bacteria. Score 2 was defined as skin with

405

marked acanthosis and hyperkeratosis, without erosion or ulceration, with or without

406

pustules, with or without hemorrhages and erythrocytic crusts with or without dermal

407

fibrosis. Finally, score 3 was defined as skin presenting a segmental epidermis,

408

localized to extensive, necrotizing to necrosuppurative epidermis with balloon

409

degeneration of epithelial cells, necrotic vasculitis and intralesional bacteria

410

(spirochaetes, bacilli, and coccobacillus). Otherwise, the total bacterial invasion score

411

(BIS) encompassed also the spirochaetes identified by the WWS staining. The score

412

0 represented the absence of invasive bacteria; score 1, a low number of invasive

413

bacteria; score 2, a moderate number of invasive bacteria; score 3, a high number of

414

invasive bacteria.

415
416

DNA Extraction, 16S rRNA amplification, illumina MiSeq sequencing.

417

Bacterial DNA extraction was enhanced adding to every sample 20 μl of proteinase K,

418

180 μl of tissue lysis buffer, and 40 μl of lysozyme (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA).

419

Thereafter, all the samples were incubated for 12 h at 56°C and then processed directly

420

for DNA extraction using the Powerlyzer Powersoil Kit (Quiagen, Valencia, CA)

421

according to the manufacturer's instructions. Extractions were performed in rounds of

422

10 samples and in every round, an additional empty tube was processed in parallel to

423

serve as a negative extraction control. Finally, the resulting supernatant of each sample

424

was transferred to a labeled microcentrifuge tube and stored at -20°C

425

The Quant-iT dsDNA Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) was used to

426

measure DNA concentrations prior to PCR amplification. The V4 region of the bacterial

427

16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR, using Illumina Nextera XTIndex Primer 1

428

(N7xx) and Primer 2 (S5xx), where barcodes were unique to each sample. The PCR

429

protocol consisted of an initial denaturation at 95 ̊C for 10 minutes followed by 40

430

cycles of 95 ̊C for 30 seconds and 60 ̊C for 1 minute and the real-time fluorescence

431

data acquisition occurred at the end of each annealing/extension phase. All PCR

432

assays use the same PCR cycling conditions allowing parallel testing of all PCR

433

assays. The amplicons were extracted and purified from the gel using the Zymo gel

434

extraction kit according to the manufacturer's instructions and quantified using the

435

Quant-iT dsDNA Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). Finally, the purified

436

amplicons were sequenced using the MiSeq reagent kit v2 (13 cycles) on the MiSeq

437

platform (Illumina, Inc., CA, USA).

438
439

Sequencing data processing

440

The generated 16S rRNA raw gene sequences were preprocessed to remove any

441

remaining, barcodes or adapters using Trimmomatic v0.3831. Raw reads were then

442

processed using R32, implementing the established DADA2 workflow33. The sequence

443

variants in each sample were inferred using the “divisive amplicon denoising

444

algorithm”, a parameterized model of substitution errors to distinguish sequencing

445

errors from real biological variation

446

were then merged, removing sequences that did not perfectly overlap and

447

subsequently chimeras were removed. Thereafter, to these ASV taxonomic labels

448

were assigned through a Bayesian classifier using the Ribosomal Database Project

449

(RDP) v16 training set35,36. The phylogenetic relatedness of the ASV identified was

450

calculated using the R package decipher37 and, spurious ASV not occurring in two or

451

fewer samples were removed. Finally, the ASV were agglomerated according to a

452

cophenetic distance inferior to 0.03.

453
454

Statistical analyses

455

The statistical analyses were performed using R32. The analysis strategy consisted of

456

the following 4 steps: i) Investigate the dynamics of the skin microbiota on feet suffering

457

lesions of DD using different microbial proxies of community diversity and structure. ii)

458

Investigate the dynamics of the skin microbiota on feet suffering lesions of DD using

459

different microbial proxies of community diversity and structure. iii) Explore whether

460

the microbiotas studied were affected by different factors that have been previously

461

identified to impact the clinical evolution of DD lesions (Clinical variables). iv) Identify

462

differential ASV that may affect the evolution of DD lesions over time.

463

The clinical variables explored were the allocation group (nT Vs. T), the usage or not

464

of individual topical antibiotic treatments (IndTx) during the study, the M5 stages

465

recorded, the lesion type (proliferative or not), and lastly the bacterial invasion and

466

lesion scoring performed during the histopathologic evaluation. The diversity and

467

structure of microbiotas were explored using the R packages microbiome and

468

phyloseq38. In detail, four different proxies including richness (count of observed ASV),

469

diversity (Shannon index), evenness (Pielou index), and dissimilarity were determined

470

in every sample. General changes in the microbiota abundances were investigated

471

through the Pielou and the Shannon indexes. While the Pielou index measures the

472

evenness of ASV abundances and how abundances are distributed

473

index determines the microbial diversity by encompassing the richness and evenness

474

metrics. Otherwise, the Bray-Curtis distances were calculated to explore the

39,

the Shannon

475

dissimilarity, the degree of difference between the microbiotas studied according to the

476

different clinical variables studied. All microbial proxies were compared between the

477

allocation groups (nT Vs. T) over time by using the Mann-Whitney U test, and within

478

the group over time by using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Likewise, all microbial

479

proxies were compared between the clinical variables studied using Kruskal-Wallis and

480

pairwise Mann–Whitney U tests. The impact of the clinical variables on the structure of

481

microbiotas over time was visualized using the Bray-Curtis distances and nonmetric

482

multidimensional scaling ordination (NMDS). In the scatter plots created, high

483

dissimilarity of microbiotas was represented by long distances between dots, whereas

484

microbiotas with a similar composition were clustered together.

485
486

Finally, the dynamic on DD microbiota composition was explored by identifying specific

487

ASV changing over time and according to the allocation group through a differential

488

abundance analysis using the R package DEseq223. DEseq2 uses a negative binomial

489

distribution and implement the variance stabilization transformations of the ASV read

490

counts identified in the raw data set to account for overdispersion. A single model was

491

fitted including the main effects of the allocation group and the sample time. Within the

492

allocation groups, a code for animal identification was created and included as a fixed

493

effect in the model to account for dependencies between the multiple samples within

494

the same cow. For each allocation group, the noticeable effects (p-value ≤ 0.05) on the

495

counts of ASV were investigated between the microbiotas of: i) healthy skin Vs. of DD

496

lesions at day 0, ii) DD lesions at day 0 Vs. DD lesions after 15 days, iii) DD lesions at

497

day 0 Vs. DD lesions after 30 days and, iv) DD lesions at day 0 Vs. DD lesions after

498

45 days. No comparisons between the allocation groups were performed during the

Figure 3. Differential abundance of amplicon sequence variants (ASV) present in skin microbiotas
from feet suffering bovine digital dermatitis (DD) lesions. (A) DD lesions versus healthy skins at day
0 before footbath implementation (BF), (B) DD lesions at day 15 versus DD lesions at day 0 BF, (C)
DD lesions at day 30 versus DD lesions at day 15, (D) DD lesions at day 45 versus DD lesions at
day 30. Bubbles represent the ASV classified at the genus level (x-axis) that showed statistically
noticeably changes (y-axis) on a log2-scale. The sizes of the bubbles represent the mean relative
ASV abundance and are colored according to their phylum-level classification. Unclassified ASV at
the genus level are groped at the Phylum level (*).
