A detailed understanding of the sources of heritable variation is a central goal of modern
genetics. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in humans1 have implicated tens of
thousands of DNA sequence variants in disease risk and quantitative trait variation, but these
variants fail to account for the entire heritability of diseases and traits. GWAS have by design
focused on common DNA sequence variants; however, recent studies underscore the likely
importance of the contribution of rare variants to heritable variation2. Further, finding the genes
that underlie the GWAS signals remains a major challenge. Here, we use a unique model system
to disentangle the contributions of common and rare variants to a large number of quantitative
traits. We generated large crosses among 16 diverse yeast strains and identified thousands of
quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that explain most of the heritable variation in 38 traits. We
combined our results with sequencing data for 1,011 yeast isolates3 to decouple variant effect
size estimation from allele frequency and showed that rare variants make a disproportionate
contribution to trait variation as a consequence of their larger effect sizes. Evolutionary analyses
revealed that this contribution is driven by rare variants that arose recently, that such variants are
more likely to decrease fitness, and that negative selection has shaped the relationship between
variant frequency and effect size. Finally, we leveraged the structure of the crosses to resolve
hundreds of QTLs to single genes. These results refine our understanding of trait variation at the
population level and suggest that studies of rare variants are a fertile ground for discovery of
genetic effects.

How variants with different population frequencies contribute to trait variation is a central
question in genetics. Theoretical considerations4–8 and previous results in yeast9, humans10–12,
and other species13 suggest that rare variants should have larger effect sizes, or, equivalently, that
variants implicated in trait variation should be shifted to lower frequencies relative to all
variants. Variance partitioning by allele frequency has revealed appreciable contributions of
lower-frequency variants to heritability of complex traits in humans, such as prostate cancer14
height2,15, and body mass index2. However, a direct comprehensive comparison of the effects of
rare and common variants has been lacking in humans owing to low statistical power to map rare
variants and confounding between effect size and allele frequency. Here we report a
comprehensive study in yeast designed to overcome these limitations. We built a panel of
approximately 14,000 segregants from crosses between 16 diverse yeast strains, mapped
thousands of QTLs that account for most of the heritable variation in 38 quantitative traits, and
measured the QTL effect sizes. We then estimated the allele frequencies of the underlying
variants in a collection of over 1,000 sequenced yeast isolates from around the world3. Analysis
of these large complementary data sets enabled us to examine the relationship between QTL
effect sizes and variant frequency, characterize the genetic architecture of quantitative traits on a
population scale, and improve mapping resolution, in many cases to single genes.

To investigate the genetic basis of quantitative traits in the yeast population, we selected 16
highly diverse S. cerevisiae strains that capture much of the known genetic diversity of this
species. Specifically, they contain both alleles at 82% of biallelic SNPs and small indels
observed at minor allele frequency > 5% in a collection of 1,011 S. cerevisiae strains3. We
sequenced the 16 strains to high coverage in order to obtain a comprehensive set of genetic
variants. We constructed a panel of 13,950 individual recombinant haploid yeast segregants by
crossing each parental strain to two different strains and collecting an average of 872 progeny
per cross (Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 1). We genotyped these segregants by highly multiplexed
whole-genome sequencing, with median 2.3-fold coverage per base per individual. Genotypes
were called at 298,979 genetic variants, with an average of 71,117 genetic variants segregating in
a single cross. We phenotyped each segregant for 38 fitness traits in duplicate by automated
growth assays and quantitative imaging (Methods). The resulting genotype-by-phenotype matrix
(over half a million phenotypic measurements and 158 billion combinations of genotype and
phenotype) formed the basis for all downstream analyses.

We used a variance components model16–18 to show that, on average, additive genetic effects
accounted for just over half of the total phenotypic variance, while pairwise genetic interactions
accounted for 8%, approximately 1/6 as much as additive effects (Fig. 2 inset, Supplementary
Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 2). We carried out QTL mapping to find the specific loci
contributing additively to trait variation. We used a joint mapping approach that leverages

information across the entire panel of 13,950 segregants (Methods). We mapped 4,552 QTLs at a
false discovery rate (FDR) of 5%, with an average of 120 (range 52-195) QTLs per trait
(Supplementary Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 3). The detected QTLs explain a median of 73% of
the additive heritability per trait and cross, showing that we can account for most of the genetic
contribution to trait variation with specific loci (Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 2). We
complemented the joint analysis with QTL mapping within each cross and found a median of 12
QTLs per trait at the same FDR of 5%. The detected loci explained a median of 68% of the
additive heritability (Supplementary Table 2). The joint analysis was more powerful, explaining
an additional 5% of trait variance and uncovering 458 QTLs not detected within individual
crosses. Consistent with the higher statistical power of the joint analysis, these additional QTLs
had smaller effect sizes (median of 0.071 SD units vs 0.083 SD units; Wilcoxon rank sum test
W=1e6, p=9e-5).

To investigate the relationship between variant frequency and QTL effects, we focused on
biallelic variants observed in our panel whose frequency could be measured in a large collection
of 1,011 sequenced yeast strains. Based on their minor allele frequency (MAF) in this collection,
we designated variants as rare (MAF < 0.01) or common (MAF > 0.01). By this definition,
27.8% of biallelic variants in our study were rare. For each trait, we computed the relative
fraction of variation explained by these two categories of variants in the segregant panel
(Methods)15. Across all traits, the median contribution of rare variants was 51.7%, despite the
fact that they constituted only 27.8% of all variants, and that a rare variant is expected to explain
less variance than a common one with the same allelic effect size. These results are consistent
with rare variants having larger effect sizes and making a disproportionate contribution to trait
variation. Comparing different traits, we saw a wide range of the relative contribution of rare
variants, from almost none for growth in the presence of copper sulfate and lithium chloride to
over 75% for growth in the presence of cadmium chloride, in low pH, at high temperature, and
on minimal medium (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 4). The results for
copper sulfate and lithium chloride are consistent with GWAS for these traits in the 1,011
sequenced yeast strains—these two traits had the most phenotypic variance explained by
detected GWAS loci, which inherently correspond to common variants, with large contributions
coming from known common copy-number variation at the CUP and ENA loci, respectively3.

In a complementary analysis, we investigated the relationship between the allele frequency of the
lead variant at each QTL and the corresponding QTL effect size. Although the lead variant is not
necessarily causal, in our study it is likely to be of similar frequency as the causal variant, and a
simulation analysis showed that this approach largely preserves the relationship between
frequency and effect size (Supplementary Fig. 4). Most QTLs had small effects (64% of QTLs
had effects less than 0.1 SD units) and most lead variants were common (78%), consistent with
previous linkage and association studies. We observed that QTLs with large effects were highly
enriched for rare variants, and conversely, that rare variants were highly enriched for large effect
sizes (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig. 5). For instance, among QTLs with an absolute effect of at

least 0.3 SD units, 145 of the corresponding lead variants were rare and only 90 were common.
Rare variants were 6.7 times more likely to have an effect greater than 0.3 SD (Supplementary
Table 3, Fisher’s exact test, p<2e-16). Theoretical population genetics models show that for traits
under negative selection, variant effect size is expected to be a decreasing function of minor
allele frequency4,5. We empirically observe this relationship in our data for most of the traits
examined, providing evidence that they have evolved under negative selection in the yeast
population (Supplementary Fig. 6).

The existence of a close sister species of S. cerevisiae—S. paradoxus—allowed us to distinguish
rare variants by their ancestral state. Variants that share the major allele with S. paradoxus are
more likely to have arisen in the S. cerevisiae population recently than those that share the minor
allele with S. paradoxus. We classified low-frequency variants as recent or ancient according to
whether their major or minor allele was shared with S. paradoxus, respectively. Recently arising
deleterious alleles have had less time to be purged by negative selection, and therefore recent
variants are expected to have stronger effects on gene function, and hence manifest as QTLs with
larger effects. Consistent with the expectation above, we observed that recent variants were 1.8
times more likely than ancient variants to have an effect size greater than 0.1 SD units (Fisher’s
exact test p=9e-5) (Fig. 3c). We further examined the direction of QTL effects and found that
recent variants were 1.5 times more likely to decrease fitness (Fisher’s exact test p=8e-3).
Strikingly, no ancient variant decreased fitness by more than 0.5 SD units, whereas 41 recent
variants did (Fisher’s exact test p=7e-3).

An understanding of trait variation at the level of molecular mechanisms requires narrowing
QTLs to the underlying causal genes. Such fine-mapping is a challenge because genetic linkage
causes variants across an extended region to show mapping signals of similar strength. Statistical
fine-mapping aims to address this challenge by estimating the probability that each variant
within a QTL region is causal based on the precise pattern of genotype-phenotype correlations19–
21
. Our crossing design enables us to obtain higher resolution for QTLs observed in two crosses
that share a parent strain by looking for consistent inheritance patterns in both. Specifically, we
focused on QTLs with effects greater than 0.14 SD units and used a Bayesian framework20 to
compute the posterior probability that each variant is causal (Fig. 4a). We then aggregated these
probabilities to obtain causality scores for each gene in a QTL. With this approach, we resolved
427 QTLs to single causal genes at an FDR of 20%. Because some QTLs have pleiotropic effects
on multiple traits, this gene set contains 195 unique genes, greatly expanding the repertoire of
causal genes in yeast. We searched the literature and found that 26 of the 195 genes identified
here are supported by previous experimental evidence as causal for yeast trait variation21–25 (Fig.
4b, Supplementary Table 5). At a more stringent FDR of 5%, we found 105 unique causal genes,
which included 24 of the 26 genes with experimental evidence.

Causal genes were highly enriched for GO terms related to the plasma membrane (45 of 522,
16.5 expected, q=1.8e-7), metal ion transport (13 of 83, 2.6 expected, q=0.0009), and positive
regulation of nitrogen compound biosynthesis (28 of 393, 12.5 expected, q=0.0076)

(Supplementary Table 5). Strikingly, 5 of the 6 genes involved in cAMP biosynthesis were
identified as causal (IRA1, IRA2, BCY1, CYR1, and RAS1; 0.19 expected, q=0.0002). Additional
genes in the RAS/cAMP signaling pathway were also identified as causal, including GPR1,
which is involved in glucose sensing, SRV2, which binds adenylate cyclase, and RHO3, which
encodes a RAS-like GTPase. In yeast, the RAS/cAMP pathway regulates cell cycle progression,
metabolism, and stress resistance26. Variation in many of these genes influenced growth on
alternative carbon sources. We hypothesize that the yeast population contains abundant
functional variation in genes that regulate the switch from glucose to alternative carbon sources
through the RAS/cAMP pathway.

We previously used a cross between lab (BY) and vineyard strains (RM) of yeast to show that
the majority of heritable phenotypic differences arise from additive genetic effects, and we were
able to detect, at genome-wide significance, specific loci that together account for the majority of
quantitative trait variation18,27. It has been argued that the BY lab reference strain S288c used in
those and many other yeast studies is genetically and phenotypically atypical compared to other
yeast isolates28. Our results here, obtained from crosses among 16 diverse strains, generalize
these findings to the S. cerevisiae population and show that S288c is not exceptional from the
standpoint of genetic variation and quantitative traits. We discovered over 4,500 quantitative trait
loci (QTLs) that influence yeast growth in a wide variety of conditions. These loci likely capture
the majority of common variants that segregate in S. cerevisiae and have appreciable phenotypic
effects on growth. We were able to localize approximately 8% of the QTLs to single genes based
on genetic mapping information alone. Interestingly, these genes cluster in specific functional
categories and pathways, suggesting that different strains of S. cerevisiae may have evolved
different strategies for nutrient sensing and response as a function of specializing in particular
environmental niches29. In addition to the findings described here, we anticipate that our data set
will be a useful resource for further dissecting the genetic basis of trait variation at the gene and
variant level, and for evaluating statistical methods aimed at inferring causal genes and variants.
In particular, the set of loci and genes identified here provides an ideal starting point for
massively parallel editing experiments that directly test the phenotypic consequences of
sequence variants30.
By combining our results with deep population sequencing in yeast3 we were able to examine the
contributions of variants in different frequency classes to trait variation. We observed a broad
range of genetic architectures across the traits studied here, with variation in some traits
dominated by common variants, while variation in others is mostly explained by rare variants.
Overall, rare variants made a disproportionate contribution to trait variation as a consequence of
their larger effect sizes. A complementary mapping approach in an overlapping set of yeast
isolates also revealed enrichment of rare variants with larger effect sizes (Fournier and
Schacherer, personal communication). These results are consistent with the finding from GWAS

that common variants have small effects, as well as with linkage studies that find rare variants
with large effect sizes. Our study design also revealed a substantial component of genetic
variation—variants with low allele frequency and small effect size—that has been refractory to
discovery in humans because both GWAS and linkage studies lack statistical power to detect this
class of variants. Recent work in humans has suggested that rare variants account for a
substantial fraction of heritability of complex traits and diseases2. Our study presents a more
direct and fine-grained view of this component of trait variation and implies that larger sample
sizes and more complete genotype information will be needed for more comprehensive studies in
other systems.
