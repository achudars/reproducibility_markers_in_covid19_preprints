Abstract
Allele-speciﬁc targeting by CRISPR provides a point of entry for personalized gene therapy
of dominantly inherited diseases, by selectively disrupting the mutant alleles or diseasecausing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), ideally while leaving normal alleles
intact. Despite unprecedented speciﬁcity and tremendous therapeutic utility of allelespecific targeting by CRISPR, few bioinformatic tools have been implemented for the
allele-specific purpose. We thus developed AsCRISPR (Allele-specific CRISPR), a web
tool to aid the design of guide sequences that can discriminate between alleles. It can
process with query sequences harboring single-base or short insertion-deletion (indel)
mutations, as well as heterozygous SNPs deposited in the dbSNP database. Multiple
CRISPR nucleases and their engineered variants including newly-developed Cas12b and
CasX are included for users’ choice. AsCRISPR provides the downloadable results of
candidate guide sequences that may selectively target either allele. Meanwhile, AsCRISPR
evaluates the on-target efficiencies, specificities and potential off-targets of those
candidates, and also displays the restriction enzyme sites that might be disrupted upon
successful genome edits. Other than designing allele-specific guide sequences for treating
diseases, AsCRISPR could also be exploited to help studying the potential functions of
genetic variants at certain gene loci by applying allele-specific editings. AsCRISPR is

Introduction
Inherited diseases are caused by various types of mutations, insertions/deletions (indels),
large genomic structural variations, as well as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
that are critical for personalized medicine. Of those, dominant inherited diseases present a
special challenge for researchers to conduct gene therapies. Those patients inherited only
one mutated allele and one normal allele on pairs of chromosomes. The treatment strategy
typically involves an allele-specific manipulation by silencing or ablating the pathogenic
alleles while exerting no aberrant effects on the wild-type ones. Previously, numerous
studies used allele-specific short interference RNAs (siRNAs) to selectively suppress
dominant mutant allele, and produced immense therapeutic benefits [1, 2]. Until recent
years, allele-speciﬁc CRISPR genome editing has emerged to be a promising means to treat
those dominant diseases. The CRISPR system provides a highly specific genome editing
that is capable of discriminating disease-causing alleles from wild-type ones, whenever the
genetic variants (1) generate unique protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs); or (2) located
within the spacer region, especially the seed region of the sgRNAs [3].
So far, allele-specific CRISPR has been increasingly employed in treating various diseases,
including dominant diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa [4-7], corneal dystrophy [8] and
dominant progressive hearing loss [9], as well as genome imprinting diseases [10]. And
also it was used to alleviate haploinsufficiency by allele-specific CRISPR activation of
wild-type alleles [11], and even was designed for manipulating HLA locus [12]. More
excitingly, this strategy has been recently utilized to selectively inactivate mutant
Huntington (HTT), taking advantage of novel PAMs created by SNPs flanking the HTT
locus [13, 14]. Overall, allele-specific CRISPR is now believed to be a promising
personalized strategy for treating genetic diseases.
However, it is always labor intensive and time consuming to figure out appropriate guide
sequences that may discriminate between two alleles [8, 13]. Currently, most web servers
only design sgRNAs from the reference genomes, without allele discriminations. Here we
developed AsCRISPR (Allele-specific CRISPR), a web server to aid the design of
sgRNAs, for allele-specific genome engineering. It has incorporated multiple CRISPR
nucleases and can process flexibly with either input DNA sequences or heterozygous SNPs.
To the best of our knowledge, AsCRISPR shows to be a valuable new resource for genome
editing technologies that can design discriminating sgRNAs based on a short stretch of
input sequences or SNP numbers, and involves newly-developed Cas nucleases such as
Cas12b and CasX as well.
Implementation
AsCRISPR was developed using PHP and Perl on a Linux platform with an Apache web
server. The front and back separation model was used; the front end is based on the Vue +
Element, and the back end is based on the Laravel, a PHP web framework.

Single-base mutations, short indels, and SNP IDs are the formats for input (Figure 1). The
SNP
information
was
downloaded
from
dbSNP
v150
database
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP) and stored in MySQL database. To optimize the SNP
query performance, an index on SNP table was added. Sequence can be extracted from
the .2bit file (hg19/GRCh37, hg38/GRCh38, or mm10/GRCm38) with the twoBitToFa
command base on the SNP information (chromosome, start genomic position and end
genomic position, reference allele and alternate allele). AsCRISPR displayed the SNP sites
located at both flanking nucleotides of a query SNP ID, which was implemented using D3.
In principle, AsCRISPR proceeds to figure out if (i) query variants give rise to novel PAMs,
which confers stringent allele-specific targeting, or (ii) query variants locate within the seed
region of guide sequences, which may abolish the Cas cleavage (Figure 1). AsCRISPR
then outputs the candidate guide sequences, after performing the stringent search and filter.
For example, those guide sequences with novel PAMs generated by variants that constitute
an ambiguous genetic code (such as R and Y in the CjCas9:NNNNRYAC), will be excluded.

Scripts from CRISPOR (https://github.com/maximilianh/crisporPaper) were then
integrated into AsCRISPR to assess sgRNA properties and scores. AsCRISPR also
searched for possible sites recognized by restriction enzymes deposited in our database. In
addition, guide sequences were further analyzed and reminded as "Not recommended" if
(i) the GC contents are beyond 20%~80%; or (ii) containing four or more consecutive T,
which might terminate the U6 or U3 promoter-drived transcription.

Figure 2. Input of query sequences. Demonstration of query DNA sequences for Cas9: 59 bp minimum
(A) and Cpf1/Cas12b/CasX: 53 bp minimum (B). To maximize users’ demands, the length of input
spacer sequence for Cas9 was set as 22 bp for query. Notably, AsCRISPR will only output 20 bp standard
spacers for Cas9 instead. All in all, the input DNA sequence for AsCRISPR basically requires minimum
59 bp in length, with at least 29 bp flanking the mutation/variation site (*), to completely showcase the
possible candidate sgRNAs. The format of input DNA sequences would be: N29[N1/N2]N29, in which
N1 denotes the sequences in the wild-type allele and N2 denotes the sequences in the mutated or varied
allele. (C) In query with an SNP ID, AsCRISPR will display other SNP sites located at both flanking 29
nucleotides.

Results
AsCRISPR helps to design sgRNAs based on four major types of Cas nucleases including
the commonly used Cas9, Cpf1 and also recently reported Cas12b [15, 16] and CasX [17],
each type of which contains its variant subtypes with distinct PAM sites and seed lengths
(Table 1). This allows the users to freely choose the optimal combination of Cas protein
and sgRNA to meet their own needs.
Input Format
The inputs for AsCRISPR could be DNA sequences harboring single-base mutations or
short indels, and also simply SNP IDs deposited in the dbSNP database. All inputs will be
finally processed as the format of N29[N1/N2]N29, in which N1/N2 denotes the sequence
in the wild-type/reference and mutated/varied allele, respectively. Thus, it means that the
input sequence requires 59 bp minimum in length, with at least 29 bp flanking the
mutation/variation site, to be processed for the output of a complete list of candidate
discriminating sgRNAs (Figure 2A, B). Notably, when users are in query with an SNP ID,
AsCRISPR will also display other SNP sites located at both flanking 29 nucleotides
(Figure 2C), which provides extra variation information and would be of great value for
designing personalized gene targeting.
Candidate Guides
AsCRISPR provides downloadable results with candidate sgRNAs that target only one
allele (Figure 3). For better visualization, AsCRISPR ranks all guide sequences first by
listing pairs with the same PAM sequence back-to-back. Furthermore, AsCRISPR
evaluates their on-target efficiencies, specificity efficiencies and potential off-targets
throughout the genome, taking advantage of the CRISPOR’s scoring system [18].
Specifically, the on-target efficiencies were calculated with multiple reported algorithms
and were normalized to 0-1. For SpCas9, efficiency scores were predicted according to Xu
et al., 2015 [19]; Doench et al., 2016 [20]; Moreno-Mateos et al., 2015 [21]; and Listgarden
et al., 2018 [22], respectively. For SaCas9, efficiency scores were predicted according to
Najm et al., 2018 [23]. And for Cpf1, Cas12b and CasX, efficiency scores were predicted
according to Kim et al., 2018 [24].
Off-targets
The potential off-target sequences throughout the genome are searched by 3-base
mismatches maximum (Figure 3). AsCRISPR lists the number of off-targets for each guide
sequence with 0, 1, 2 or 3 mismatches (0-1-2-3). Clicking on the (0-1-2-3) will reveal more
information about the off-target information in the downstream data sheet, including the
locations (exon, intron or intergenic region), sequence mismatches and so forth. Users can
freely re-rank the off-targets by locations. The specificity score measures the uniqueness
of a guide sequence in the genome. The higher the specificity score, the lower are off-target
effects. Specificity scores were calculated based on Hsu scores [25] and CFD scores [20].

For Cpf1, Cas12b and CasX, no off-target ranking algorithms were available in the
literatures so far, instead we just applied Hsu and CFD scores to their off-targets.
Restriction Sites
AsCRISPR also searches for possible sites recognized by restriction enzymes along the
spacer sequences (Figure 3), which might be disrupted after gene targeting, and further
determines whether those candidate enzymes are also allele-specific. This provides an
important tool for the characterization and screening of targeted single colonies by
restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP).
Exemplary Running
We have listed several typical sequences on the website for exemplary running. For
example, heterozygous PINK1 p.G411S is one of the ideal mutations for allele-specific
targeting, which was previously demonstrated to increase the risk of Parkinson’s disease
via a dominant-negative mechanism [26]. In the Cas9 mode, AsCRISPR outputs 11
discriminating sgRNAs in combination with 3 subtypes of Cas9 including SpCas9,
SpCas9-V(R)QR and SaCas9-KKH (Table 2). One of those sgRNA exploits a novel PAM
(5’-CgG-3’) created by the mutation, and another 5 pairs of sgRNAs containing the
mutation point within the seed region selectively target either wild-type allele or mutated
allele (Table 2). Therefore, by using Cas9, totally 5 candidate sgRNAs might be specific
to the mutated PINK1 p.G411S allele, which are ready for the users’ experimental
evaluations (Table 2). Besides, we also listed other exemplary mutations including the
single mutations (TGFBI p.L527R; RHO p.P23H; LMNA p.G608G), 3-base delete
mutations (TOR1A p.E303del) and short indel mutations (COL7A1 c.8068_8084delinsGA).
Similarly, for heterozygous SNPs, AsCRISPR processes with the input SNP numbers and
translates them into DNA sequences (59 bp) after retrieving the genomic database. As an
example, we used AsCRISPR to analyze one of the SNPs, rs62621675:[C>G], only with
Cas9, and successfully obtained 13 discriminating sgRNAs in combination with 4 subtypes
of Cas9 including SpCas9-V(R)QR, SpCas9-EQR, SpCas9-VRER and CjCas9 (Table 2).
Three of those sgRNA exploits novel PAMs (5’-AgA-3’; 5’-AgAG-3’; 5’-AGAGACAc3’) created by the SNP, and another 5 pairs of sgRNAs containing the variant point within
the seed sequence (Table 2).
Users can freely select the candidate sgRNAs by Cas types, on-target efficiencies,
specificity scores, off-targets properties, and others. We recommend to select the sgRNAs
with novel PAMs, since they contribute to the most stringent discrimination. For a more
detailed demonstration, users can also find a AsCRISPR tutorial on the website, which can
be read online or downloaded as a pdf document.

Future Developments
So far, AsCRISPR has integrated the genomes of Homo sapiens (hg19/GRCh37), Homo
sapiens (hg38/GRCh38) and Mus musculus (mm10/GRCm38). We are planning to upload
more genomes for analysis in the near future, to expand its allele-specific utilities. Notably,
our understanding of on- and off-target sgRNA efficiencies is evolving rapidly. Although
the on-target efficiencies in AsCRISPR were calculated with multiple reported algorithms,
the scoring algorithms have been continuously improved. Cas12b and CasX may have their
special efﬁciency scoring algorithms that are different from those of Cas9 and Cpf1,
however, to our best knowledge, there are still lack of published studies working on it. We
will thus incorporate the convincing scoring algorithms, which predict either on- or offtarget efficiencies, into AsCRISPR as they became available. We also welcome any
constructive feedback from users for improving our web server.
Conclusion and Discussion
We have thus developed AsCRISPR, which is an easy-to-use and streamlined web tool for
designing potential discriminating sgRNAs between alleles to facilitate the CRISPR-based
personalized therapy. Particularly, we incorporated two recently reported types of Cas
nucleases, Cas12b and CasX, which show to be promising for genetic engineering due to
their smaller size and higher specificity.
As we just finished the AsCRISPR implementation, another software termed
AlleleAnalyzer was published, aiming to identify optimized pairs of personalized and
allele-specific sgRNAs [27]. AlleleAnalyzer also leverages patterns of shared genetic
variation across thousands of publicly available genomes to design sgRNA pairs that will
have the greatest utility in large populations [27].
However, the difference is that AsCRISPR as a web tool can process either query sequences
or SNP numbers, which is more likely demand-driven for research studies and clinical
therapeutics. Moreover, AsCRISPR only outputs single sgRNAs instead of pairs of
sgRNAs, although the users may also freely use AsCRISPR to manually design another
sgRNA to make an sgRNA pair. Note that numerous non-coding RNAs or regulatory
elements are widespread, dual-sgRNA excision of a large DNA fragment might bring about
extra risks for disease treatment. Thus, we believe that AsCRISPR possesses extra allelespecific utilities and add to the bioinformatic repositories for allele-specific genomic
editings.
Interestingly, people have been avoiding genetic variants when designing sgRNAs for
therapeutic genome editing in large populations. Previous studies have performed
comprehensive analysis on the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) and 1000
Genomes Project (1000GP) data sets, and determined that genetic variants could negatively
impact sgRNA efficiency, as well as both on- and off-target specificity at therapeutically

implicated loci [28, 29]. Thus, for the CRISPR-based therapy in large patient populations,
genetic variations should be considered in the design and evaluation of sgRNAs to
minimize the risk of treatment failure and/or adverse outcomes. To address that, people
thus endeavor to identify universal/platinum sgRNAs located in the low-variation regions,
with the help of, for example, the ExAC browser, to maximize their population efficacy
[28].
Although the genetic variations would be a challenge for platinum sgRNA design, it
provides a promising entry for designing allele-specific or personalized sgRNAs in treating
individual patients. Deciphering genetic variations helps to seek common platinum
sgRNAs for the treatment in large populations, whereas AsCRISPR, as well as
AlleleAnalyzer, go towards the opposite direction that exploits the discrimination abilities
of heterozygous genetic variants to facilitate the design of allele-specific targets for
individuals in the era of precision medicine.

are labeled in red and turned into lowercase.

Note: When processing with the guide sequences from varied/alternative alleles, it is highly possible that one of those

off-targets (containing 1-base mismatch labeled with $) would be exactly the sequence of their corresponding wildtype/reference alleles. This will compromise the specificity scores of guide sequences from varied/alternative alleles to
some extent.
