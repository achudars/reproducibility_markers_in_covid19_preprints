Abstract
Genetic crosses are most powerful for linkage analysis when progeny numbers are high,

31

when parental alleles segregate evenly and, for hermaphroditic organisms, when numbers of

32

inbred progeny are minimized. We previously developed a novel genetic crossing platform for

33

the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, an obligately sexual, hermaphroditic

34

protozoan, using mice carrying human hepatocytes (the human liver-chimeric FRG NOD huHep

35

mouse) as the vertebrate host. Here we examine the statistical power of two different genetic

36

crosses – (1) between a laboratory parasite (NF54) of African origin and a patient-derived Asian

37

parasite, and (2) between two sympatric patient-derived Asian parasites. We generated >140

38

unique recombinant clones over a 12-month period from the four parental genotypes, doubling

39

the number of unique recombinant progeny generated in the previous 30 years. Both crosses

40

show bi-parental inheritance of plastid markers amongst recombinant progeny, in contrast to

41

previous crosses (conducted using chimpanzee hosts) which carried single dominant plastid

42

genotypes. Both crosses show distinctive segregation patterns. The allopatric African/Asian cross

43

has minimal levels of inbreeding (2% of clonal progeny are inbred) and extreme skews in marker

44

segregation, while in the sympatric Asian cross, inbred progeny predominate (66% of clonal

45

progeny are inbred) and parental alleles segregate evenly. Using simulations, we demonstrate

46

that these progeny arrays (particularly the sympatric Asian cross) have excellent power to map

47

large-effect mutations to a 31 kb interval and can capture complex, epistatic interactions that

48

were far beyond the capacity of previous malaria crosses to detect. The extreme segregation

49

distortion in the allopatric African/Asian cross erodes power to detect linkage in several genome

50

regions, but the repeatable distortions observed offer promising alternative approaches to

51

identifying genes underlying traits of interest. These crosses show surprising variation in marker

52

segregation, nevertheless, the increased progeny numbers improve our ability to rapidly map

53

biomedically important parasite traits.

Author Summary
Understanding how genome mutations contribute to newly emerging drug resistance in

57

parasites like Plasmodium falciparum is important to monitor the spread of drug resistance. This

58

scenario has been playing out in Southeast Asia with the emergence and spread of artemisinin

59

resistance. Here we show that new P. falciparum genetic crosses, using mice carrying human

60

liver cells and infused with human red blood cells (the human liver-chimeric FRG NOD

61

huHep/huRBC mouse), provide an important new tool for understanding complex interactions

62

underlying drug resistance phenotypes. We report two new genetic maps with 84 and 60 unique

63

recombinant progeny, which doubles the number of progeny available from 4 previous P.

64

falciparum genetic crosses. Through extensive simulations we show that with 84 progeny we can

65

find association for a gene that controls only 20% of the variation in a phenotype. We also show

66

that a cross generated from Southeast Asian parasites collected from the same geographic region

67

have unique characteristics not previously observed in P. falciparum genetic crosses. This

68

Southeast Asian cross exhibits even segregation across the genome, unbiased inheritance of

69

mitochondria and apicoplast and higher levels of inbreeding than previously observed.

Introduction
Eukaryotic parasites inflict a high burden of morbidity and mortality particularly in the

73

developing world. Control of these pathogens is threatened by drug resistance [1, 2].

74

Understanding the genetic architecture of drug resistance in eukaryotic pathogens is essential to

75

understand treatment failure. Previous studies in Plasmodium, Trypanosome and Leishmania

76

parasites revealed the genetic architecture of drug resistance is unexpectedly complex [3-6]. For

77

example, emergent artemisinin resistance in the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium

78

falciparum, has been causally associated with multiple independent mutations in one gene,

79

pfK13, which explain nearly all the variation in this phenotype [7-9]. However, mutations in the

80

pffd, pfarps10, pfmdr2, and pfcrt genes are significantly associated with resistance, and have

81

been proposed to constitute a genetic background highly predisposed to the development of

82

resistance [7]. Several techniques have been used to identify the genetic determinants of complex

83

phenotypes in eukaryotic pathogens including GWAS [7, 10], in vitro selections [8], QTL

84

analysis in controlled genetic crosses [11-14] and bulk segregant analysis [5, 15]. Controlled

85

genetic crosses offer a uniquely powerful way to dissect the genetic architecture of a complex

86

trait. For example, the F1 progeny of a controlled cross revealed that P. falciparum sensitivity to

87

quinine was associated with loci on chromosomes 5, 7 and 13, with the chromosome 5 and 7 loci

88

containing known drug resistance transporters pfcrt and pfmdr1 [3].

89

P. falciparum has the potential to be a particularly powerful genetic mapping system because

90

of its unusually high recombination rate of 11-13.3 kb/cM [13, 16, 17], a haploid state for most

91

of the life cycle, and the ability to clone every F1 progeny in vitro, creating effectively immortal

92

mapping populations in a single generation. Also, P. falciparum has a small genome (23 Mb) and

4

93

a high-quality reference assembly [18] with frequent annotation updates [19, 20]; consequently,

94

re-sequencing and comprehensive analysis of the genome of F1 progeny is simple and cost

95

effective [21]. Generating controlled genetic crosses in P. falciparum, however, has historically

96

been a difficult and time-consuming process requiring splenectomized chimpanzees in place of a

97

human host. This has resulted in only four genetic crosses being performed over a thirty-year

98

period. F1 mapping populations from all four previous P. falciparum genetic crosses have been

99

small, containing 33, 35, 15 [21] and most recently 27 individual recombinant progeny [13].

100

When compared to the thousands of F1 progeny possible in many plants and fruit flies [22], these

101

numbers are small indeed. To use genetic mapping to elucidate the genetic architecture of

102

emerging drug resistance in P. falciparum we need to be able to rapidly create genetic crosses

103

with large numbers of progeny from recent field isolated parasites which exemplify highly

104

relevant clinical traits such as drug resistance.

105

Here we report the production of large numbers of unique recombinant progeny from human

106

liver-chimeric FRG huHep mice infused with human red blood cells. Although these mice were

107

previously reported as an option for producing new P. falciparum genetic crosses once

108

chimpanzee research was discontinued [23], until now they have failed to produce more progeny

109

than historic crosses. In this paper, we successfully produced two new genetic crosses in under

110

twelve months using recent clinically derived P. falciparum isolates with emerging resistance

111

phenotypes. This effort was aided by a new progeny characterization bioinformatics framework

112

that filters SNP variants and identifies clonal unique recombinant progeny. We generate genetic

113

maps for each cross (84 and 60 unique recombinant progeny, respectively) and provide the most

114

detailed investigation of inbreeding, plastid inheritance, and cross-over rates in malaria parasite

115

genetics to date. One cross exhibited abundant segregation distortion. We confirm this is

repeatable by independently replicating the genetic cross, and exclude a fluorescent marker

117

integrated into genome of one parent as the cause. Through simulation and mapping with real

118

data we investigate the power to detect genetic associations as a function of the number of

119

progeny. We also examine the effect of segregation distortion on power in mapping a phenotype

120

in a cross with varying levels of segregation distortion.

Results

123

Rapid Generation of Genetic Crosses

124

Over a 12-month period we carried out two independent genetic crosses. The first

125

between a laboratory-adapted African line (NF54) and a newly cloned clinical isolate

126

(NHP4026) from the Thai-Myanmar border, the second between two newly cloned clinical

127

isolates (MKK2835 and NHP1337) from the Thai-Myanmar border. These crosses yielded 84

128

and 60 clonal unique recombinant progeny lines respectively. The pipeline to the point of

129

analyzing recombinant progeny is technically challenging and takes approximately six months

130

(Fig 1). Initially, we confirmed that the clinical isolate parental lines produced infectious

131

gametocytes that gave rise to infectious sporozoites that could the successfully infect the liver of

132

human hepatocyte-chimeric FRG NOD huHep mice and subsequently transition to in vivo and

133

then in vitro blood stage culture. After this confirmation, the steps to successfully complete a

134

genetic cross includes asexual culture and expansion, gametocyte maturation, mixing of parental

135

gametocytes and transmission to mosquitoes, confirmation of successful mosquito stage

136

development, salivary gland sporozoite isolation and infection of human hepatocytes in the FRG

137

NOD huHep mouse, liver stage development, infusion of human red blood cells, the in vivo

138

transition from liver stage-to-blood stage, the subsequent transition to in vitro blood stage culture

139

coupled with cloning by limiting dilution and finally clonal expansion, confirmation of clonality

140

and genome sequencing of recombinant progeny (Fig 1).

141

In total we initiated three independent crosses using five parental genotypes (NF54-

142

GFPLuc x NHP4026, NF54WT x NHP4026 and MKK2835 x NHP1337). The second of these

143

crosses was performed to test if a GFP cassette integrated into the genome had driven a peak in

144

segregation distortion (described below). The progeny from the first crosses were combined

145

(subsequently referred to as NF54 x NHP4026) to form one genetic map (described below). We

146

set up each genetic cross by infecting multiple cages of mosquitos with mixed gametocyte

147

cultures of our parental lines (S1 Table). Details NF54-GFPLuc x NHP4026 were previously

148

published [23]. For NF54WT x NHP4026 three cages were used to infect three mice by IV

149

injection or mosquito bite (MB) (one cage per mouse). Two mice were infected by MB using

150

cages with 250 mosquitos with prevalence of 73% and 58% and median 3 oocyst/mosquito. One

151

mouse was infected by IV injection of 1 million sporozoites dissected from 250 mosquitos with

152

infection prevalence of 73% and median 6 oocysts/mosquito. Assuming no attrition in parasite

153

genotypes, and a perfect outcrossing rate this would mean that 2190 and 1740 unique

154

recombinant progeny respectively were possibly inoculated into two mice by mosquito bite and a

155

pool of 1460 unique recombinant progeny was used to infect one mouse via IV infection.

156

Similarly, for MKK2835 x NHP1337 four cages of mosquitos were infected with pools of

157

MKK2835 and NHP1337 gametocyes and the cage with the best infections (80% prevalence and

158

median 3 oocysts/mosquito) was used to infect a single mouse via IV injection with 2.7 million

159

sporozoites. We would expect a maximum of 1958 unique recombinant progeny based upon 80%

160

successful infections and a median of 3 oocysts per mosquito and 204 mosquitos.

162

Numbers of Unique Recombinant Progeny

163

In these malaria parasite crosses, the F1 progeny are present in the blood of the infected

164

FRG NOD huHep/huRBC mouse and must be isolated by limiting dilution cloning. The progeny

165

isolated in this way are not guaranteed to be clonal because a small subset of post-dilution

166

cultures will have been initiated with more than one clone. Additionally, as the malaria parasite

167

undergoes clonal expansion in the mosquito, liver and mouse blood stream [24] we may sample

168

the same recombinant genotype more than once. Since the parents in both crosses readily

169

produce fertile male and female gametocytes it is also possible for selfed progeny to be

170

produced. We thus developed a bioinformatics pipeline to identify clonal unique recombinant F1

171

progeny filtering out non-clonal progeny, selfed progeny and repeat sampling of the same

172

genotype (see Methods).

173

Genetic characterization of previous crosses was initially carried out with RFLP or MS

174

markers [16, 25] and unique recombinant progeny from these crosses were recently sequenced to

175

create a community resource [21]. For NF54 x NHP4026, we filtered out some non-unique

176

recombinant progeny using MS genotyping and then performed direct genome sequencing of

177

cloned parasites. For MKK2835 x NHP1337, we performed genome sequencing of all cloned

178

parasites. For each prospective progeny, sequencing reads were mapped to version 3 of the P.

179

falciparum genome [26] and SNP variants were called jointly across parents and perspective

180

progeny and filtered to contain SNPs in the 20.8 Mb core genome as defined in Miles et al. 2016

181

[21].

182

In NF54 x NHP4026, 10,472 high-quality bi-allelic SNPs (1 SNP per 2.0 kb) differentiate

183

the two parents. For this cross, 166 prospective progeny were identified during limiting dilution

184

cloning. After filtering to remove non-clonal and selfed progeny 128 recombinant progeny

185

remained (Fig 2), 84 of which were unique. In MKK2835 x NHP1337, the parent lines are

186

sympatric patient-derived Asian parasites. Despite their higher degree of relatedness we

187

identified 7,198 high-quality bi-allelic SNPs (1 SNP per 2.9 kb) that distinguish the two parents.

188

For this cross 266 prospective progeny were identified during limiting dilution cloning. Filtering

189

was performed to remove non-clonal and selfed progeny leaving 61 recombinant progeny (Fig

190

2), 60 of which were unique. We initiated multiple cloning rounds to maximize the capture of

191

unique recombinant progeny from each cross. Interestingly, across all crosses each cloning round

192

produced nearly distinct sets of recombinant progeny, with only one repeat genotype across

193

cloning rounds (Fig 2 and S1 Fig).

194
195

Inbreeding, Outbreeding and Plastid inheritance

196

Through our filtering process we identified stark differences in patterns of outcrossing

197

between these two crosses. The clones recovered from NF54 x NHP4026 contained few selfed

198

progeny with three selfed NF54 progeny and 0 selfed NHP4026 progeny (1.8%, 3/166 progeny

199

selfed). In contrast, in MKK2835 x NHP1337 we observed a large amount of selfing with 144

200

selfed NHP1337 progeny and five MKK2835 selfed progeny (56%, 149/266 progeny selfed; Fig

201

2). In both crosses, when cloning was initiated immediately after mouse exsanguination or within

202

five days of establishing in vitro culture, almost all recombinants were unique (S2 Table and S1

203

Fig). Interestingly, when cloning was initiated within five days, whether from continuous in vitro

204

culture or cryopreservation of bulk culture, the percentage of recombinants that were unique was

205

high (90-100% for continuous culture vs. 93% from a thawed cryopreserved bulk culture).

206

However, when cloning was initiated after 14 or 19 days of in vitro culture from cryopreserved

207

bulk culture, a lower percentage of unique recombinant progeny were recovered with 46% and

208

50% of recombinants identified as unique (S2 Table and S1 Fig).

209

P. falciparum parasites contain two plastid genomes, the mitochondria and apicoplast,

210

both of which are maternally inherited [27]. Despite P. falciparum being hermaphroditic, in

211

previous genetic crosses nearly all plastid genomes in the progeny originated from a single

212

parent [28, 29]. We show here that this is not the case. In each cross we observed both plastid

213

genotypes among the unique recombinant progeny. After excluding selfed genotypes we

214

observed 17.9% NF54 plastid genotypes in NF54 x NHP4026 and 41.7% MKK2835 plastid

215

genotypes in MKK2835 x NHP1337.

216
217
218

Genetic maps and recombination rates
For each genetic cross, we generated a genetic map (S3 and S4 Tables) using JoinMap

219

v4.1 from phased genotype data for all unique recombinant progeny (see Methods). The map size

220

for both crosses is consistent with map lengths reported for previous crosses (1521 cM for NF54

221

x NHP4026 and 1626 cM for MKK2835 x NHP1337, Table 1). The recombination rate was 13.7

222

kb/cM for NF54 x NHP4026 and 12.8 kb/cM for MKK2835 x NHP1337, which were

223

comparable to the range observed in previous crosses (Table 1). In NF54 x NHP4026 genetic

224

map, markers initially sorted into 13 linkage groups, with each representing markers known to

225

reside on single chromosomes, with the exception of one linkage group which contained all

226

markers on chromosome 7 and 14. Adjusting joinMap parameters resulted in separating the 13th

227

linkage group into 2, recovering distinct sets for chromosomes 7 and 14. In MKK2835 x

228

NHP1337 all markers coalesced into 14 linkage groups which exactly corresponded to

229

chromosomes.

To generate a graphic display of the physical map, 5 kb windows of the core genome

234

were phased to indicate inheritance blocks for each unique recombinant progeny (Fig 3A and

235

3B). NF54 x NHP4026 shows sections of the genome where inheritance is dominated by one

236

parental genotype or the other (Fig 3A). In contrast the physical recombination map for

237

MKK2835 x NHP1337 shows a more even inheritance pattern across the genome (Fig 3B).

238
239
240

Repeatability of segregation distortion
We observe regions with significant segregation distortion (chi squared test for deviation

241

from expected Mendelian ratio of 1:1, p<0.001) in NF54 x NHP4026 that are consistent in both

242

replicates (Fig 3A and 4A). In contrast, we observe no significant segregation distortion in

243

MKK2835 x NHP1337 (Fig 3B). Specifically, in both replicates of NF54 x NHP4026 we

244

observe replicated significant deviations from the Mendelian expectation of 1:1 inheritance on

245

chromosomes 7, 12, 13 and 14 (Fig 3A) with a concordance correlation coefficient of 0.66

246

between allele frequencies in the two replicates across the genome. We initially observed the

247

segregation distortion in progeny from the NF54-GFPLuc x NHP4026 cross replicate. The major

248

peak on chromosome 13 coincided with the insertion of the GFP cassette in to the pf47 locus in

249

the NF54-GFPLuc parasite which we hypothesized could be the reason for the distortion.

250

Therefore, we repeated the NF54WT x NHP4026 cross using the unedited parental NF54 with

251

NHP4026 to test if the genetic modification was the driver of the distortion. This was not the

252

case and the repeatability of the skews strongly supports the alternative hypothesis that the GFP

253

cassette is not the driver of this distortion, allowing us to combine the progeny from NF54 x

254

NHP4026 in estimating genetic maps.

257

Distorted Loci
We examined each distorted locus for plausible driver genes.

259

distortion in both biological replicates of NF54 x NHP4026 (chi squared test, p<0.001, Fig 4B,

260

region having only 0.05% NHP4026 alleles in NF54GFPLuc x NHP4026 replicate and 0%

262

NHP4026 in the NF54 x NHP4026 replicate. This highly distorted region contains 17 genes (Fig

263

4B) including pfcrt (PF3D7_0709000). NHP4026, along with three recombinant progeny, are

264

each highly resistant to chloroquine in vitro. Mutations in pfcrt are the main driver of

265

chloroquine resistance and have been shown to confer a fitness costs in some genetic

266

backgrounds [31].

Chr12: a 295 kb region (with 71 genes) shows replicated significant segregation distortion with

268

an overabundance of NHP4026 alleles. The most skewed region contains five genes (Fig 4C)

Chr13: a 230 kb region predominantly inherited from NHP4026 with 56 genes that shows

274

replicated significant segregation distortion. The most highly distorted subregion on

275

chromosome 13 contains pf47 (PF3D7_1346800). In the NF54GFPLuc x NHP4026 replicate of

276

this cross the NF54 line contained a GFPLuc cassette inserted in pf47 [23] however this insert is

277

not present in the NF54 parent used in the NF54WT x NHP4026 replicate of this cross, which

278

shows the same distortion pattern.

279

Chr14: a 205 kb region containing 62 genes on chromosome 14 showed replicated significant

280

segregation distortion with alleles predominantly inherited from NF54. The most highly skewed

281

sub-region contains 15 genes including pfarps10 (PF3D7_1460900) and has been associated

282

with slow clearance in GWAS studies [7] and is hypothesized to contribute to a permissive

283

background for evolution of pfk13 mutations.

284

Previous P. falciparum genetic crosses exhibited significant segregation distortion at

285

several loci [13, 16, 17, 25]. We explored overlap between distorted regions in all the published

286

P. falciparum crosses and our two new crosses and included a previously published bulk analysis

287

of selection in uncloned progeny of the MKK2835xNHP1337 cross [33] (S2 Fig). We observe

288

overlaps on chromsomes 12, 13 and 14.

Increased mapping power in an expanded genetic cross
Previous genetic crosses have been used to map the genetic basis of a wide range of

292

traits. However, small sample size (Table 1) and rampant segregation distortion (S2 Fig) have

293

likely limited detection to mutations with very large effect size (ES). A quantitative dissection of

294

this has not been performed for malaria parasite crosses. To quantify the extent to which our

295

expanded progeny set will improve genetic mapping for the malaria community we performed

296

extensive simulations. We quantified the impact of phenotypic replication, progeny number and

297

the number of loci determining a trait to the power to map a trait and mapping resolution using

298

the 84 progeny from NF54 x NHP4026 (Fig 5 and S3 Fig). Briefly, we used the full progeny

299

panel from NF54 x NHP4026 (n = 84) or subsamples of this panel (n = 60, 50, 40, 30) and

300

simulated phenotypes at different effect sizes using loci with balanced inheritance (0.5 allele

301

frequency) to simulate the phenotype (see Methods for details). We then determined whether the

302

phenotype mapped to the correct loci with a significant LOD score (true positive), did not have a

303

significant association (false negative) or mapped to a different locus (false positive). Using

304

progeny panels comparable to previous genetic crosses (n = 30-40) only very large effect sizes

305

(ES > 0.5) can be mapped with high power (>80%). In contrast, 84 progeny enable mapping of

306

much smaller effect sizes (ES = 0.2) at 80% power. Increasing the number of progeny also

307

increases the locus resolution (S3 Fig). At an ES of 0.5, with n = 30 we can on average map to a

308

region containing 58 genes; moreover, with n = 84, we can map to a region containing only 17

309

genes (S3 Fig). At small effect sizes we observe similar large increases in mapping resolution as

310

we increase the size of the progeny set and more modest increases for larger effect sizes (S3 Fig).

311

Most genetic traits are not monogenic but are complex in nature. To better capture the

312

complex genetic architecture, multiple loci must be identified and these loci sometimes interact

313

(i.e. do not contribute individually and additively). For a trait controlled by two additive loci that

314

contribute equally to the phenotype, 60 progeny, with replicated phenotypes can detect an

315

association at ES = 0.3, whereas 84 progeny are needed to detect an association at ES = 0.2.

316

When a trait is controlled by two epistatically interacting loci, 84 progeny with replicated

14

317

phenotypes provide 75% power to detect an association and interaction with ES = 0.4. Replicated

318

phenotypes allow the same power to be achieved with fewer progeny for ES ≥ 0.3 and allow for

319

a trait with ES = 0.2 to be detected for N = 84 progeny for additive loci. This analysis indicates

320

that the four previous P. falciparum crosses (conducted in chimpanzee hosts) generating from 15

321

- 35 progeny, were underpowered. In progeny sets of this size could reliably detect associations

322

only for phenotypes with large effects sizes, ES ≥ 0.5 and were not able to detect even a very

323

strong epistatic interaction. Our two new crosses with n = 60 and 84 progeny have much higher

324

power and are capable of reliably detecting phenotypes with effect sizes as low as 0.2.

325

Polygenic traits don’t always have equal contributions from multiple loci. In malaria

326

parasites, there are several well-known phenotypes with one known major effect locus [34],

327

including chloroquine resistance and mutations in pfcrt, sulfadoxine and point mutations in

328

pfdhps, pyrimethamine and point mutations in pfdhfr, atovaquone and point mutation in pfcytb,

329

mefloquine and pfmdr1 and artemisinin resistance and mutations in pfk13. It is an open question

330

whether we could detect more subtle secondary loci with genetic crosses with additional

331

progeny. Our analysis (Fig 6) shows that with 84 progeny we can detect secondary loci with ES

332

as low as 0.2 and 0.15. However, with smaller numbers of progeny we are not able to detect both

333

contributing loci. With 60 progeny we can detect only one of the secondary loci at ES=0.2 and

334

with 35 progeny we can detect neither secondary loci.

335
336

Segregation distortion decreases the resolution and power of mapping

337

Segregation distortion is abundant across nearly all P. falciparum genetic crosses

338

generated to date, with our newly generated MKK2835 x NHP1337 cross being the sole

339

exception. We performed a power analysis to determine the impact of segregation distortion on

15

340

the power to identify causal variants. Segregation distortion decreases power to detect effects

341

near the distorted locus, especially for phenotypes with small effect sizes (Fig 7). For phenotypes

342

with large effect sizes and for large numbers of progeny, the extent of segregation distortion in

343

the F1 mapping population at the controlling locus has little effect on power; however, as the

344

number of progeny decrease, a significant loss of power occurs as the degree of segregation

345

distortion increases. The loss of power due to segregation distortion is even more pronounced

346

with fewer progeny (Fig 7). For an ES of 0.8, we can detect associations for loci with any allele

347

frequency using as little as 30 progeny. For an effect size of 0.4, 50 progeny are necessary to

348

detect an association for allele frequencies ranging from 0.3 to 0.7, and only 84 progeny will

349

allow us to detect an association at a more distorted loci with 0.2 or 0.8 allele frequency. At 0.2

350

effect size we can only reliably detect an association for a locus with even segregation using 84

351

progeny.

352

In NF54 x NHP4026 we observe significant segregation distortion (p<0.001) with allele

353

frequencies at distorted loci ranging from 0.05 to 0.31 and 0.69 to 0.85 (Fig 3), including in

354

regions that include important drug resistance genes including pfcrt (Chromosome 7) and pfk13.

355

Despite this extreme segregation distortion on chromosome 7 in NF54 x NHP4026 (NHP4026

356

allele frequency of 0.05), it is still possible to map the chloroquine drug response to the locus

357

containing pfcrt (p<0.00001, Fig 7B). In contrast, in MKK2835 x NHP1337, allele frequencies

358

of the NHP1337 alleles range from 0.3 to 0.7 (Fig 3). At these allele frequencies we see

359

consistent power indicating that power and mapping resolution are expected to be consistent

360

across the genome.

363
364

Power of P. falciparum genetic crosses generated using FRG NOD huHep/huRBC mice
Historical challenges to generating novel P. falciparum genetic crosses made GWAS, in vitro

365

selection experiments and bulk sequencing approaches the more effective means to study new

366

drug resistance-associated phenotypes as they emerge in the clinic. However, each of these

367

techniques has its limitations. In vitro selections are time consuming, sometimes requiring

368

several years to produce resistant lines, and may not identify loci evolving under drug pressure in

369

the field situation [35]. GWAS is often confounded by population structure and has low power to

370

dissect complex genetic traits, i.e. multiple loci, multiple alleles per locus and epistasis [36]. On

371

the other hand, a well-conceived and controlled genetic cross can greatly complement these

372

techniques, as each cross can be designed to answer specific questions and then have high power

373

to dissect complex associations between genotype and phenotype. Historically, P. falciparum

374

controlled genetic crosses have been made with splenectomized chimpanzees strictly limiting

375

their production due to cost and ethical concerns. Use of the human tissue-chimeric FRG NOD

376

huHep/huRBC mouse restores and expands our ability to make controlled genetic crosses in

377

malaria parasites [23]. We demonstrate here that targeted crosses between clinical isolates can be

378

generated in real time (six months) and outperform all previous crosses in their size, mapping

379

power and precision.

380

We created the first P. falciparum cross between two sympatric recent clinical isolates from

381

the Thai-Myanmar border, MKK2835 and NHP1337. Analysis of the recombination rate,

382

segregation distortion, and selfing rate of this cross revealed interesting differences to all other P.

383

falciparum crosses including our NF54 x NHP4026 cross, between a lab line and a recent field

384

isolate. In MKK2835 x NHP1337 we observed minimal segregation distortion and a high

385

percentage of clones that resulted from selfing. We have also shown that most of the

17

386

recombinant progeny recovered are unique when cloning is initiated immediately, or within five

387

days of establishing in vitro culture. Using simulations, we have shown that the power to detect

388

associations between phenotypes and genotypes increases drastically when we are able to map

389

with populations with 60 – 84 individuals. We have also shown through simulation and using

390

real phenotype data that segregation distortion can lower power to detect QTL at distorted loci

391

even for phenotypes with moderate effect sizes. Nevertheless, major effect loci can be mapped

392

within these regions, supporting the utility of our crosses in these cases. Furthermore, because

393

we can cryopreserve uncloned F1 parasite populations, it is possible to further isolate additional

394

independent recombinant progeny for future analyses, as sequential cloning attempts will isolate

395

new unique progeny.

396
397

Power of malaria crosses generated using humanized mice

398

We have shown that the FRG NOD huHep/huRBC mouse can be used to rapidly make

399

controlled genetic crosses on demand from field isolates to create F1 progeny populations with

400

large numbers of clonal recombinant progeny per cross. This dramatically increases our power to

401

detect associations with greater resolution. Using new crosses with more recombinant progeny

402

and higher power we can dissect genetic architecture and determine the individual contributions

403

of different loci to polygenic traits. We can also map phenotypes with small to modest effect

404

sizes more precisely, to smaller regions of the genome. For instance, at an ES of 0.5 using 30

405

recombinant progeny, we can map to a region containing 58 candidate genes. However, at an ES

406

of 0.5 using 84 progeny, we can map to a region of 17 candidate genes (S3 Fig). With increased

407

transfection efficiencies using CRISPR/Cas9-based technology, it is not unreasonable to then

408

target the genome by transgenesis to pinpoint loci involved in observed phenotypes. For

409

phenotypes with large ES, similar to that conferred by chloroquine resistance (0.8), with 30

410

progeny we can map to a region containing on average 20 candidate genes whereas with 84

411

progeny we can map to a region containing only eight genes. These significant reductions in

412

number of candidate genes has a large impact on our ability to determine causal mutations,

413

drastically reducing the effort required for validation studies. Furthermore, our ability to generate

414

further genetic crosses between the same two parents of interest is unparalleled, allowing us to

415

potentially isolate 100’s of unique recombinant progeny for analysis.

416
417
418

Maximizing Numbers of Unique Recombinant Progeny
Based on the prevalence of infected mosquitos and estimates of oocysts/mosquito we can

419

estimate the number of unique recombinants in the mosquitos used to infect each FRG NOD

420

huHep/huRBC mouse. During the parasite lifecycle there are multiple bottlenecks which reduce

421

the number of genotypes in a blood stream infection. Oocysts may arise due to selfing or fail to

422

progress, sporozoites may fail to reach the liver and further attrition through the liver and blood

423

stages will occur. As we observed, without extensive cloning efforts we are unable to capture all

424

these possible unique recombinant progeny. Interestingly, each cloning round produced almost

425

entirely unique sets of progeny indicating that our cloning efforts (166 clones for NF54 x

426

NHP4026 and 266 for MKK2835 x NHP1337) under-sampled the total population of

427

recombinant progeny available. Recovering unique sets of progeny from each cloning round

428

indicates that there are likely many more additional unique progeny to recover from the bulk F1

429

populations and that strategic additional cloning would likely provide a substantial return in F1

430

progeny numbers. In order to maximize the number of unique recombinant progeny recovered,

431

we showed that cloning straight after the in vivo liver stage to blood stage transition or as early as

19

432

possible after establishing in vitro culture gave a large degree of success. Also, initiating cloning

433

either directly from the mouse or from a thawed stock of bulk culture did not impact the

434

proportion of unique recombinant progeny recovered. Notably, we minimized the potential for

435

additional loss in diversity during cryopreservation by freezing immediately after exsanguination

436

and cloning within 48 hours of thaw. Additionally, with streamlining of the crossing process and

437

being able to complete a cross from thawing of parental lines to isolating, genotyping and

438

identifying unique recombinant progeny within 6 months it is easy to simply repeat the cross and

439

generate an entirely distinct set of recombinant progeny to generate additional unique

440

recombinant progeny.

441
442

Differences in selfing between crosses

443

P. falciparum infections in nature are sometimes monoclonal and sometimes co-infections,

444

depending on the genetic diversity of the gametocytes taken up during a mosquito blood meal.

445

Thus, P. falciparum must be able to maintain its life-cycle through selfing as well as out-

446

crossing. Evidence from natural infections suggests that mating can by non-random when

447

distinct parasite lineages are co-transmitted from a single mosquito bite [37]. In previous crosses

448

between established lab lines 3D7 and HB3, it was shown that selfed progeny are observed at

449

expected ratios in oocysts [38, 39] and early in blood stage culture, but at lower than expected

450

ratios among clones when cloning was begun 32 days after isolation from chimpanzees [40, 41].

451

In 7G8 x GB4, 29 of more than 200 (14.5%) individual clones were selfed [25].

452

Our MKK2835 x NHP1337 cross between two recent field isolates, both from Southeast

453

Asia, produced more selfed progeny than previously reported for P. falciparum genetic crosses.

454

Interestingly, NHP1337 dominated the selfed progeny almost entirely, consistent with bulk allele

455

frequencies in samples taken at similar times [33]. While efforts were made to infect the

456

mosquitos with equal number of MKK2835 x NHP1337 gametocytes, the unequal selfing rates

457

may reflect an imbalance in the initial gametocyte ratio or in gametocyte viability between

458

MKK2835 and NHP1337. It is also possible that there are inherent difference in selfing rates

459

between MKK2835 and NHP1337, although both lines successfully selfed in mosquito cages

460

infected with only one parent (S1 Table). We do not yet know if the large proportion of selfed

461

clones observed in our cross between recent field isolates will be repeated in future crosses.

462

Using bulk segregant analysis of these same populations we suspect that these selfed clones are

463

outcompeted over time in non-stressed in vitro culture conditions [33] this may perhaps also

464

have been the case in the previous 3D7 x HB3 cross [39, 40].

465

In contrast we observed very few selfed progeny in our NF54 x NHP4026 cross, between a

466

recent Southeast Asian field isolate NHP4026 and the established African lab line NF54. Both

467

NF54 and NHP4026 readily self when in used alone to inoculate mosquito cages with NF54

468

often giving very high infection prevalence and numbers of oocysts/midgut (S1 Table). In

469

several cloning rounds of NF54 x NHP4026, cloning was initiated immediately after transition to

470

in vitro culture, indicating that in this cross selfed progeny were not selected against in bulk

471

competition with recombinant progeny. Further experiments will be necessary to understand why

472

NF54 x NHP4026 generated so few selfed progeny.

473
474
475

Differences in segregation distortion between crosses
In other systems segregation distortion is often more extreme when more distantly related

476

parents are crossed. For instance, interspecific crosses have been shown to result in segregation

477

distortion more often and with more severe distortion that intraspecific crosses [42, 43]. All

478

previous P. falciparum genetic crosses were between allopatric parasite lines, generally isolated

479

on different continents, and unsurprisingly show significant segregation distortion over large

480

regions of the genome. Similar to previous P. falciparum crosses, our allopatric cross between an

481

establish lab line (NF54 or NF54GFPLuc, African origin) and a recent field isolate (NHP4026,

482

Thai-Myanmar border) had regions of significant segregation distortion that were consistent

483

across replicates. Conversely, the MKK2835 x NHP1337 cross which relied on two sympatric

484

parasites recently isolated from the Thai-Myanmar border was the first P. falciparum controlled

485

genetic cross to have relatively even inheritance patterns across the genome with no significant

486

segregation distortion. One possible explanation for the observed segregation distortion is that

487

natural selection may act against unfit allele combinations causing a deviation from expected

488

mendelian rations [44]. It is also possible that there are prezygotic barriers such as barriers to

489

gamete recognition between more distantly related parents.

490

In NF54 x NHP4026, the subregions with the most highly skewed allele frequencies in each

491

of the significantly distorted regions contain genes of interest. The most highly distorted

492

subregion on chromosome 7 (predominantly inherited from the NF54 parent with only 3 progeny

493

inheriting alleles from NHP4026) includes pfcrt which is known to carry a substantial fitness

494

cost in some genetic backgrounds and that different combinations of mutations are more

495

deleterious than others [31]. Although NHP4026 is a parasite that grows particularly well in in

496

vitro culture [45] (even outcompeting NF54 in co-culture experiments) it is clear that inheriting

497

an NHP4026 allele at this locus contributes a fitness cost. The most highly skewed subregion on

498

chromosome 14 is also predominantly inherited from NF54 and contains pfarps2 which has been

499

associated with artemisinin resistance (slow clearance of parasite from treated patients) in

500

GWAS studies and is thought to contribute to a permission background for development of

501

artemisinin resistance [7]. While NHP4026 is pfk13 WT it does have a slow clearance

502

phenotype. It will be interesting to explore weather pfarps10 has a fitness cost in this genetic

503

background. Interestingly, while we see no segregation distortion in MKK2835 x NHP1337

504

among the cloned progeny, we do see selection on chromosome 14 over time in a uncloned bulk

505

culture of MKK2835 x NHP1337 cross F1 progeny that is also centered on pfarps10 where

506

selection is against the derived alleles in pfarps10 [33].

507

Alternatively, on chromosomes 12 and 13 there are subregions where alleles are more

508

commonly inherited from NHP4026. The region on chromosome 12 include pfmrp2 and the

509

region on chromosome 13 includes pf47. The most skewed region on chromosome 12 overlaps

510

with the selected region in a uncloned bulk culture of MKK2835 x NHP1337 cross F1 progeny

511

except that selection is against the derived allele in pfmrp2 in this case. Pfmrp2 has been

512

associated with mefloquine and piperaquine response in vitro and parasite clearance [32] in Thai

513

isolates and we speculate it may have a fitness cost in vitro. The role pfmrp2 plays in drug

514

resistance is still unclear and these genetic crosses may help elucidate its function. In the

515

NF54GFPLux x NHP4026 replicate, the NF54 parent contained a gfp/luciferase cassette insert

516

on chromosome 13 in pf47, the NF54WT x NHP4026 replicate of this cross was made with the

517

isogenic NF54 line without the gfp/luciferase insert. We saw consistent inheritance patterns in

518

both biological replicates of this cross indicating the skew here is gfp/luciferase insert

519

independent. A large region of segregation distortion was observed on chromosome 13 in 7G8 x

520

GB4, part of which overlaps our region of segregation distortion in NF54 x NHP4026 [17, 25].

521

Pf47 and pfs45/48, two 6-cys proteins are located in the center of this subregion. These two

522

genes are known to by highly polymorphic in natural populations and are thought to be under

523

selection because of roles in gamete recognition and compatibility [46, 47]. It is possible that

524

pf47 and/or pfs45/48 play a key role in segregation distortion in more distantly related lines but

525

not in a cross between allopatric recent clinical isolates. Indeed, we observed no significant

526

segregation distortion in the MKK2835 cross and also observed no selection over time on

527

chromosome 13 in the bulk segregant experiment using the MKK2835 x NHP1337 bulk F1

528

progeny [33].

529

We think that natural selection acting against unfit allele combinations is a plausible

530

explanation for some regions of segregation distortion in NF54 x NHP4026 including the regions

531

on chromosome 7, 12 and 14 and the observed selection over time in the uncloned bulk F1

532

culture from the MKK2835 x NHP1337 cross [33]. Issues with gamete recognition and

533

compatibility might drive segregation distortion observed on chromosome 13 in NF54 x

534

NHP4026 and 7G8 x GB4 (both allopatric) but not in the sympatric MKK2835 x NHP1337 cross

535

(see also [33]). Performing competition experiments between individual progeny with different

536

alleles at these distorted and selected loci will be informative in determining how different

537

combinations of alleles might contribute to parasite fitness [45]. These experiments can be

538

followed with CRISPR/Cas9 editing of polymorphisms in individual genes as further validation.

539
540

Loss of power at segregation distortion loci

541

Segregation distortion loci traditionally have been excluded in genetic mapping studies to

542

avoid loss of power to detect real effects (type II error, false negative) and the potential to detect

543

false positives (type I error) [48]. Excluding distorted loci from analysis would be particularly

544

problematic in P. falciparum because all previous crosses had large regions of significant

545

segregation distortion that contain known resistance loci. Using segregation distortion loci in

546

mapping studies is possible, however it is necessary to carefully interpret results keeping in mind

24

547

the loss of power to detect effects in distorted regions. If drug resistance loci are at or near

548

genome regions showing segregation distortion loci, we may fail to detect these drug resistance

549

loci in crosses with small numbers of progeny or when effect size is small. We have shown this

550

effect through mapping simulated phenotypes to loci with varying degrees of segregation

551

distortion. Despite the extreme segregation distortion observed in NF54 x NHP4026 (NHP4026

552

allele frequency of less than 0.05 at pfcrt) and only three progeny plus NHP4026 showing a

553

chloroquine resistant phenotype we are able to correctly map the chloroquine drug response to

554

the locus containing pfcrt. Through simulation, we demonstrate reliable detection of QTL for

555

phenotypes with very large effect sizes (ES = 0.8), even for very distorted loci and small

556

numbers of progeny. However, as the effect size decreases, we observe stronger loss of power at

557

distorted loci. For phenotypes with moderate effect sizes we can only reliably detect QTL at

558

distorted loci using large numbers of progeny. Therefore, care is required in interpreting negative

559

QTL results for phenotypes with small to moderate effect sizes, especially when mapping in

560

small progeny sets. When QTL and segregation distortion loci coincide, false negatives will lead

561

us to miss real associations between phenotypes and genetic variants. This problem with power

562

will be amplified when attempting to map omics phenotypes where multiple testing correction

563

must be employed. However, while segregation distortion presents a challenge for linkage

564

analysis, the location of genome regions showing strong skews can help to pinpoint loci with

565

large phenotypic effects.

Conclusions
We believe that the use of the human hepatoycte-chimeric FRG NOD huHep/huRBC
mouse to generate genetic crosses in P. falciparum has the potential to revolutionize quantitative

570

genetics in P. falciparum. It is feasible to generate crosses on demand to study the genetic

571

architecture of emerging phenotypes. We can also use complex cross designs to improve power

572

to detect associations for phenotypes where a genetic variant only controls a small amount of

573

variation. Shared parent crosses are ideal for understanding the role of individual mutations

574

within phenotypes with complex genetic architecture. Pairwise crosses of a small group of

575

isolates can be used to create a diversity panel that captures a large amount of phenotypic and

576

genetic variation in P. falciparum. Similarly, many other complex cross designs that have been

577

used extensively in the plant and animal breeding literature that are now open to malaria

578

researchers.

579
580
581

Methods
Genetic crosses were conducted largely as described previously [23]. We made several

582

adjustments to maximize recovery of progeny from the genetic crosses, including completing

583

independent replicates of the crosses and cloning via limiting dilution directly from the

584

transitioned blood removed from the FRG NOD huHep mouse. In addition, the transition to in

585

vitro culture was carried out using media containing Albumax rather than human serum. We

586

observed successful expansion of the transitioned cultures in both serum-containing and

587

Albumax-containing media, but downstream limiting dilution cloning failed to yield the expected

588

number of clones if carried out using serum. We therefore cloned and expanded the transitioned

589

blood stage culture in media containing Albumax. Screening for clones was carried out using the

590

Phusion Blood Direct PCR Kit (Thermo Scientific). Specific methodological information for

591

each replicate of each cross is provided in S2 Table.

593
594

Identifying Positive Clones
Beginning at week 2 post cloning and continuing until week 6 the Phusion Blood Direct

595

PCR Kit (Thermo Scientific) was utilized to identify positive clones. This kit is very sensitive,

596

detecting positive parasitemia using only 1 μL of infected culture streamlining our detection of

597

positive clones. A protocol for this screening method is available in the S1 File.

598
599
600

MS Genotyping
All progeny of NF54 x NHP4026 were initially genotyped via microsatellite markers to

601

identify unique recombinants. The progeny isolated in cloning rounds 1 and 2 or replicate 1 of

602

the NF54 x NHP4026 were genotyped at 17 MS markers. The progeny isolated in cloning round

603

3 of NF54 x NHP4026 were genotyped at 8 MS markers. Primers for each MS marker used are

604

listed in S6 Table. For cloning rounds 1 and 2, full genome sequencing was performed for all

605

unique recombinants. For cloning round 3 and all other crosses all potential recombinant progeny

606

were fully sequenced.

607
608

Preparation and sequencing of progeny

609

DNA was extracted from 35-50uL of packed red blood cells using Quick DNA Kit (Zymo).

610

Libraries were prepared with ¼ reaction volumes of the KAPA HyperPlus DNA Library Kit and

611

20-50ng of extracted DNA according to manufacturer directions with slight modifications.

612

Fragmentation time was 26 minutes; adapter ligation was increased to 1 hour; PCR was

613

performed for 7 cycles; and size selection was performed post PCR using full volume methods.

614

We used KAPA Dual-Indexed Adapter Kit, adding 7.5uM adapter to the appropriate well.

615

Samples were measured for DNA quantity using the QBit BR DNA Kit. Samples were then

616

pooled for sequencing based on their QBit measurements to normalize input. The pooled sample

617

was quantified using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit, and adjusted to 2-4nM with 10mM

618

Tris-HCl, pH 7.5-8.0 (Qiagen) for sequencing on Illumina platforms. The pool was also run on

619

the Agilent Tape Station using the D1000 BR Kit to assess sample size and lack of primer

620

dimers. Pools were run on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 or Illumina NextSeq for 2x100bp run

621
622

We aligned raw sequencing reads to v3 of the 3D7 genome reference (http://www.plasmodb.org)

623

using BWA MEM v0.7.5a [49]. After removing PCR duplicates and reads mapping to the ends

624

of chromosomes (Picard v1.56) we recalibrated base quality scores, realigned around indels and

625

called genotypes using GATK v3.5 [50] in the GenotypeGVCFs mode using QualByDepth,

626

FisherStrand, StrandOddsRatio VariantType, GC Content and max_alterate_alleles set to 6. We

627

recalibrated quality scores and calculated VQSLOD scores using SNP calls conforming to

628

Mendelian inheritance in previous genetic crosses, and excluding sites in highly error-prone

629

genomic regions (calls outside of the “core genome” [21].

630
631
632
633

Filtering high quality SNP variants
The .vcf file containing parents, potential progeny and all high quality SNPs were

634

processed in R using the vcfR library. Initially SNP filters were based on the parental

635

distributions; only homozygous, bi-allelic parental SNPs with high coverage (≥ 10) and high

636

quality scores (GQ ≥ 99) were retained. Next, low quality SNPs across parents and progeny were

637

filtered with a VQSLOD < 2.5. This final SNP set was defined as our high quality SNP set for

638

further analysis.

639
640
641

Filtering Progeny
In P. falciparum crosses to produce the F1 mapping population, it is necessary to filter out

642

potential progeny that are non-clonal and repeated sampling of the same genotype. Initially,

643

potential progeny with more than 80% missing data were removed from further analysis.

644
645

Identifying and filtering non-clonal progeny

646

Since P. falciparum parasites are haploid throughout the entirety of the human portion of

647

their life-cycle including the intraerythrocytic stage during which they are cloned we expect that

648

clonal infections should have predominantly homozygous SNP calls except for rare instances of

649

sequencing error. In contrast, non-clonal infections where the mixture contains full siblings or

650

full siblings and parent genotypes would have contiguous regions with high numbers of

651

heterozygous SNP calls at above the rate expected from sequencing error along.

652

The sequencing error rate was estimated for each cross as the mean from a distribution of

653

percent heterozygous SNP calls across all potential progeny (S4 Fig). Assuming true sequencing

654

errors follow a Poisson process with λ = % sequencing error, then the expected distance between

655

sequencing events as 1. To identify non-clonal samples we counted heterozygous SNP calls

656

across the genome in a sliding window of size 1 and using a Poisson Distribution with λ = %

657

sequencing error calculated the probability of getting at least the observed number of

658

heterozygous SNP calls in each window. These probabilities were adjusted for multiple testing

659

based on the number of windows in the genome and the adjusted probabilities were plotted as a

660

heatmap (S4 Fig). Samples with windows with adjusted probabilities < 0.05 were designated as

661

non-clonal and filtered from the final progeny set.

662
663
664

Phasing of clonal progeny
A matrix of phased genotypes was constructed for parents and clonal progeny for all high

665

quality SNPs. In each cross the drug sensitive parents (NF54 and MKK2835) were coded as 0

666

while the drug resistant parent (NHP4026 and NHP1337) were coded as 1. Progeny SNPs that

667

matched the drug sensitive parent’s SNPs were coded as 0 while SNPs that matched the drug

668

resistant parent’s SNPs were coded as 1. Heterozygous SNPs were coded as missing.

669
670
671

Identifying Unique Recombinants
Our high quality phased dataset for clonal progeny was formatted for the qtl package in R

672

and loaded as a genetic map. Genotype similarity scores were computed using the comparegeno

673

function. A similarity score cut-off of 0.9 was used to define clusters of genetically distinct

674

recombinant progeny (see S1 File for details of cut-off was chosen). Individual progeny were

675

selected from each cluster of genetically similar progeny using igraph in R. Only unique

676

recombinant progeny and parents were retained to create a final dataset of all SNPs.

677
678
679

Physical Recombination Map Construction
5kb windows were defined across the core genome to construct a heatmap depicting a

680

physical recombination map for each cross. For each progeny, in each 5kb window the most

681

common parental genotype was determined, if a window contained only missing data then it was

682

filled if the next window with data had a matching genotype to the previous window with data,

683

otherwise it was left missing.

685

Defining informative markers

686

All phased genotype data for clonal, unique recombinant progeny and parents were

687

loaded into R qtl as a genetic map. The findDupMarkers function was used to identify clusters of

688

markers with identical genotype data and the central marker from each cluster was retained in a

689

set of informative markers. This set of informative genotype markers for all clonal, unique

690

recombinant progeny was used for all subsequent analysis and figures. The entire filtering

691

pipeline is available on github (https://github.com/kbuttons/P01_ProgenyCharacterization) with

692

documentation.

693
694
695

Genetic Map Construction
For each cross the set of informative genotype markers for clonal unique recombinant

696

progeny was coded as A for the sensitive parent and B for the resistant parent and – for missing

697

data and loaded into JoinMapv4.1. Population type was set to HAP1 and the Kosambi mapping

698

function was employed in generating each genetic map. All other parameters were initially set to

699

defaults, however, to account for the systemic segregation distortion observed in the

700

NF54xNHP4026 cross it was necessary to expand the population threshold ranges such that the

701

independence LOD ranged from 1.0 to 15.0, the independence P-value from 1.0e-3 to 1.0e-5, the

702

recombination frequency from 0.250 to 0.001 and the linkage LOD from 3.0 to 15.0. This change

703

in parameters allowed us to differentiate between SNP markers with similar distortion patterns

704

that were known to be physically located on different chromosomes.

707

Progeny from NF54 x NHP4026 were used to estimate power under three different

708

scenarios, one genetic locus contributing to phenotypic variation, 2 loci with additive

709

contributions to phenotypic variation and 2 loci with epistatic interaction controlling phenotypic

710

variation. All models were simulated for the full F1 progeny set with N=84 and for subsamples

711

with N=30, 40, 50, 60 and 70. Under the one locus model, a phenotype was simulated as either a

712

single replicate value or the average of 5 replicates at effect sizes ranging from 0.1 to 0.8. Under

713

the two additive loci model, a phenotype was simulated as either a single replicate value or the

714

average of 5 replicates for effect sizes for each locus ranging from 0.1 to 0.4. Under the two

715

epistatic loci model, the first locus controlled whether a trait was present in an on/off fashion and

716

the second locus controlled the level of the phenotype (ie. locus 1 is necessary to be drug

717

resistant and locus 2 controls the level of resistance) and the main effects of both loci ranged

718

between 0.1 to 0.4. A set of markers with 1:1 mendelian inheritance patterns were used as the 1

719

or 2 loci in the models. All qtl mapping was performed with r qtl. For each simulation,

720

significance thresholds were defined based on 1000 permutations. True positives were defined as

721

a LOD peak that meant the α=0.05 significance threshold and whose 1.5 LOD interval contained

722

the actual marker used in the model.

723
724

SD Power Analysis

725

This analysis was similar to the 1 locus model in the previous section. In these

726

simulations effect sizes were calculated based on balanced inheritance and levels included 0.2,

727

0.3, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8. All markers were categorized by their allele frequency and sorted into bins

for each level of allele frequency skew (ie. 0.89 to 0.91 and 0.09 to 0.11 were in the 0.1 bin
