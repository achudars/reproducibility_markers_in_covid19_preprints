Abstract
Herbal compatibility is the knowledge of which herbs to combine in traditional Chinese medicine
(TCM) formulations. The lack of understanding of herbal compatibility is one of the key problems
for the application and popularization of TCM in western society. Because of the chemical
complexity of herbal medicines, it is simpler to begin to conduct compatibility research based on
herbs rather than component plant secondary metabolites. We have used transcriptome
analysis to explore the effects and interactions of two plant extracts (Kushen and Baituling)
combined in Compound Kushen Injection (CKI). Based on shared chemical compounds and ‚Äãin
vitro‚Äã cytotoxicity comparisons, we found that both the major compounds in CKI, and the
cytotoxicity effects of CKI were mainly derived from the extract of Kushen (‚ÄãSophorae
flavescentis‚Äã). We generated and analyzed transcriptome data from MDA-MB-231 cells treated
with single-herb extracts or CKI and results showed that Kushen contributed to the perturbation
of the majority of cytotoxicity/cancer related pathways in CKI such as cell cycle and DNA
replication. We also found that Baituling (‚ÄãHeterosmilax yunnanensis Gagnep‚Äã) could not only
enhance the cytotoxic effects of Kushen in CKI, but also activate immune-related pathways. Our
analyses predicted that IL-1ùù± gene expression was upregulated by Baituling in CKI and we
confirmed that IL-1ùù± protein expression was increased using an ELISA assay. Altogether, these
findings help to explain the rationale for combining Kushen and Baituling in CKI, and
transcriptome analysis using single herb extracts is an effective method for understanding
herbal compatibility in TCM.

Introduction
At present many complex and chronic diseases rely on therapies that combine modern
pharmaceuticals. A similar multiple-herb strategy known as ‚ÄúFufang‚Äù is an essential component
in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory and is used to achieve better therapeutic results,
and reduce side effects and herbal toxicity‚Äã1‚Äã-‚Äã2.‚Äã As result of thousands of years‚Äô of accumulated
clinical practice, TCM has more than 100,000 formulae and abundant experience that has
contributed to an understanding of which herbs should be combined in particular circumstances,
herein referred to as herbal compatibility‚Äã3,4‚Äã. However, because herbal medicines are made up of
complex mixtures of plant secondary metabolites, the mechanism of most TCM formulas has
not been explored. This limitation of TCM has become one of the key problems for its
modernization, and hinders the application and popularization of herbal medicines‚Äã5‚Äã.

Recent rapid developments in analytical chemistry and molecular biology have provided
methods for researchers to tackle the complex mechanisms of herbal compatibility on a number
of different levels. Usually, these methods focus on one or a few components within a complex
mixture, in attempts to reveal how preparation/extraction for combined use can change their
concentrations in products or pharmacokinetic processes ‚Äãin vivo‚Äã6‚Äì9‚Äã. However, as a complex
mixture may contain thousands of compounds, it is unclear how changing one or several
components in a TCM formula can explain and account for the principles and observations of
herbal compatibility. Furthermore, pharmacological models that measure phenotypes
associated with efficacy or proxies for efficacy are limited in their ability to explain potential
therapeutic effects and mechanisms. New high-throughput technologies for measuring
molecular phenotypes such as gene expression, and bioinformatic methods can provide
systematic ways for refining and clarifying complex biological processes that result from

hundreds or thousands of molecular interactions. By applying these methods to the study of
TCM, it is possible to transform the research paradigm from ‚Äúmain active compound that
influences one target‚Äù to ‚Äúmultiple components that influence many network targets‚Äù‚Äã10,11‚Äã.
Although it is now common to apply RNA-sequencing and systematic methods to study the
effects of whole TCM formulae, no literature has applied these methods to study herbal
compatibility. In this report, we apply transcriptome analysis to identify how the combination of
Kushen (‚ÄãSophorae‚Äã ‚Äãflavescentis)‚Äã and Baituling (‚ÄãHeterosmilax yunnanensis Gagnep‚Äã) extracts can
account for the broader and increased effects observed in Compound Kushen Injection (CKI).

Our model system for dissecting herbal compatibility, CKI, is derived from an ancient Chinese
formula and was approved by the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) of China in 1995.
It is widely used as an adjuvant medicine in the treatment of carcinomas for pain relief,
activation of innate immune response and reduced side effects in cancer therapy‚Äã12,13‚Äã. Our
previous results have shown that CKI suppresses the growth of cancer cells by inhibiting cell
cycle, energy metabolism, and DNA repair pathways‚Äã11,14‚Äã. Kushen is considered to be the
principal herb and major contributor to the molecular effects of CKI. Many published studies
have reported on the alkaloids and flavonoids contained in CKI, most of which are extracted
from Kushen. These compounds have been reported to have a variety of bioactivities, including
antitumor, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities‚Äã15,16‚Äã. However, there is no literature that
mentions the role of Baituling in CKI. Therefore, current studies are not sufficient to provide a
rational framework for CKI prescription or explain its molecular mechanisms.

In this report, we break down the formula into its individual components in order to study the
herbal compatibility of CKI. By comparing transcriptome changes in MDA-MB-231 cells between

CKI and single herbal extract treatments, we found that Kushen extract alone, perturbed most of
the pathways through which CKI exerts its effects on cancer cells. However, integrating Kushen
with Baituling can enhance the effects of Kushen alone on cancer-related pathways and in
addition can activate innate immune functions. These results support the TCM rationale behind
the CKI formula and confirm RNA-sequencing as a useful tool for the identification of candidate
mechanisms in TCM research.

Results
HPLC comparison of the composition of CKI and single extract injections.
In order to obtain information about plant specific components in CKI, we used
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to compare the compounds in CKI and two
single herb extracts/injections (Fig.1). From the chromatographic profile, it can be seen that
Kushen injection contributes most of the major chemical components in CKI. In contrast, few
compounds were detected in Baituling injection, which only contributes one major compound to
CKI. Based on comparison with 9 reference standard compounds, 8 main compounds derived
from Kushen (adenine, N-methylcytisine, sophorodine, matrine, sophocarpine,
oxysophocarpine, oxymatrine and trifolirhizin) are shown to contribute to CKI. Macrozamin,
which is used as a control marker for Baituling during manufacturing, only appeared in CKI and
Baituling injection. These results indicate that CKI contains major compounds from both Kushen
and Baituling, and Kushen contributes most of the major chemical components in CKI.

Comparison of the anticancer effects between CKI and single injections.
Our previous results showed CKI suppressed the proliferation of and induced apoptosis in
MCF-7 cells‚Äã11‚Äã. To determine whether single injections had similar phenotypic effects as CKI, we

conducted XTT assays to measure cell viability using three different cell lines; MDA-MB-231,
A431 and HepG2. Results showed that Kushen had stronger cytotoxic effects than Baituling in
all three cell lines. However, neither of the single injections had apoptotic effects comparable to
CKI (Fig.2A) based on rates of apoptosis determined by flow cytometry with propidium iodide
(PI) staining. Consistent with XTT cell viability results, more apoptotic cells were found in CKI
treatments than single injections and BTL had the smallest effect on apoptosis of the three
injections (Fig.2B).

Comparison of MDA-MB-231 transcriptomes from CKI and single injection
treatments.
In order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of herbal compatibility in CKI, we carried out
transcriptome profiling from CKI and single injection treated MDA-MB-231 cells. Triplicate
samples for each treatment clustered well in multidimensional scaling plots and different
treatments were clearly separated (Supplementary Fig 1). Although CKI and Kushen injection
have similar chemical profiles, the inclusion of Baituling in CKI is sufficient to change the
transcriptome of MDA-MB-231 cells compared to Kushen single injection treatment. We used
edgeR‚Äã17‚Äã to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes for each injection treatment compared to
untreated. In addition, we also identified DE genes for CKI treatment compared to Kushen
treatment to identify the effects of Baituling in CKI (Supplementary Table 3).

To validate the results of transcriptome analysis, we performed quantitative PCR for several
genes known to be important read-outs for the effects of CKI; TP53, CYD1A1 and CCND1.
Their expression levels confirmed the interaction of Baituling with Kushen observed in the
overall RNA sequencing results (Fig.2C).

Similar effects of CKI and Kushen single injection on MDA-MB-231 cells.
Because Kushen is considered to be the primary active herb in CKI, we first examined the
effects of Kushen and CKI to see if they had similar effects on genes. By comparing the DE
gene set between Kushen and CKI, the shared DE gene group accounted for 63% and 81% of
DE genes from CKI and Kushen respectively (Fig.3A), indicating that Kushen contributed to the
majority of effects from CKI.

In order to better understand the functions of shared DE genes between Kushen and CKI, we
performed over-representation analysis using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of
Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways for these 2039 genes(Fig.3B&C, Supplementary Table
5). The results showed that cell cycle- and DNA replication-related pathways and terms were
largely down-regulated by both Kushen and CKI. Based on our previous publications, perturbed
regulation of genes in these pathways and annotated by these terms was associated with the
observed cell viability and apoptotic effects CKI on cancer cells‚Äã11,14‚Äã. Other terms showing
perturbation of metabolic processes and cell migration identified in this study, such as
‚Äòpyrimidine metabolism‚Äô, ‚Äòsteroid biosynthesis‚Äô and ‚Äòpositive regulation of locomotion‚Äô, also
showed up in our previous research on the effects of CKI. Altogether, these results indicated
that Kushen was very important to the major molecular consequences of CKI treatment, and
perturbed most of the functions perturbed by CKI, including reduced viability and apoptosis in
cancer cells.

Different effects of CKI and single injections on MDA-MB-231 cells

Although the above results for enrichment analysis showed that Kushen and CKI mainly
regulate the same pathways, they did not specifically show the magnitude and direction of these
perturbations. We, therefore, performed Signalling Pathway Impact Analysis (SPIA) to compare
the ‚Äãsignificantly perturbed functional pathways across the different treatments. Ninety two
pathways were found to be significantly perturbed by CKI while only 30 of them were shown to
be activated. For Kushen and Baituling, the ratios of activated/inhibited were 29/100 and 24/58
respectively (‚ÄãSupplementary Table 4‚Äã). Clearly, Baituling perturbed fewer pathways, but the ratio
of activated/inhibited was higher than for Kushen or CKI. Interestingly, most pathways were
perturbed in the same way (inhibited or activated) by CKI and Kushen as shown in ‚ÄãFig.4A, with
very few pathways showing different types of perturbation‚Äã.

This similarity of effects between Kushen and CKI could also be seen in the high level of
correlation for pathway perturbation between Kushen and CKI (0.83 correlation coefficient)
compared to (0.33 correlation coefficient) for Baituling and CKI. CKI also had stronger
perturbation effects on most pathways (‚ÄãFig.4C‚Äã). In pathways contributing to cytotoxic effects in
cancer cells, such as cell cycle, p53 signaling pathway, proteoglycans in cancer and pathways
in cancer, Baituling perturbed the pathways in the same direction as Kushen and seemed to
reinforce those effects in CKI. However, the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway was
very interesting as it was perturbed in an opposite fashion in Baituling compared to Kushen and
did not show up as significantly perturbed by CKI treatment (‚ÄãSupplementary Fig. 2‚Äã). By
comparing DE genes for Baituling and Kushen in the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction
pathway (Fig.5), we observed that many genes were oppositely regulated by the two single
injections, such as genes in the CXC subfamily and IL6/12-like cytokine and receptor genes,
which supported the SPIA results.

The functions of Baituling in CKI.
In order to investigate the function of Baituling in CKI, we identified the DE genes of CKI
treatment compare to Kushen treatment. Only 308 DE genes were found (Fig.6A). KEGG
analysis of these genes showed that with the exception of steroid hormone biosynthesis and
transcriptional misregulation in cancer, all other pathways were related to immune function, and
most genes in this set were up-regulated (‚ÄãFig.6B, ‚ÄãSupplementary Table 5‚Äã). This result was
consistent with findings in the SPIA analysis that Baituling tended to activate immune-related
pathways. The over-represented GO terms for this gene set also included interferon-gamma
production, organ or tissue specific immune response and interleukin-2 production, all aspects
of immune function and which only contained up-regulated DE genes (Fig.6C).

The genes in the common set between Kushen and CKI compared to Kushen (Fig. 6A) were
originally changed with Kushen treatment and then further significantly regulated in combination
with Baituling (107 genes). Only three pathways (IL-17 signaling, salmonella infection and
steroid hormone biosynthesis) were over-expressed by genes in this set, indicating Baituling
could also modify functions related to immune system and hormone function upregulated by
Kushen in CKI (‚ÄãSupplementary Fig 3‚Äã.‚Äã). Furthermore, 24 genes appeared in both Baituling and
CKI sets compared to the Kushen set (Fig. 6A), which can be regarded as the direct contribution
from Baituling to the effects of CKI. Analysis of known protein-protein interactions in this gene
set identified the IL-1 family and interacting proteins known to modulate immune function
(Fig.7A). To verify that IL-1 protein levels were also changing as predicted, we carried out‚Äã an
ELISA assay to measure the IL-1 beta levels in different treatments. We were able to
demonstrate that the increased IL-1 beta level in CKI treatment compared to untreated was

mainly related to the effects of Baituling (Fig.7B).‚Äã Altogether, these results showed that Baituling
contributed to the effects of CKI primarily by altering functions related to the immune system.

In summary, we characterized the herbal compatibility of Kushen and Baitulin in CKI by
comparing the individual effects of the herbal extracts to the combined extract using
transcriptome analysis. In this fashion, we were able to explain the origin of CKI‚Äôs different
effects in MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, we also showed that Baituling could enhance the
reduction of cell viability and increased apoptosis effects from Kushen in CKI. These results not
only explained the specific molecular basis of the TCM rationale of combining Kushen with
Baituling but also illustrate a general method to apply transcriptome analysis to study ‚Äãherbal
compatibility in TCM.

Discussion
It is undeniable that chemical composition is the basis of therapeutic effects from herbal TCM.
However, because the identification and quantification of all compounds for even a single herb
are still extremely difficult if not impossible, we need alternative means to conduct TCM
research, particularly with respect to the study of herbal compatibility‚Äã18,19‚Äã. Herbal compatibility
has a basis in TCM theory, but TCM theory is not generally accepted in Western medicine and it
is difficult to map concepts from TCM theory to Western medicine. Methods that can identify the
molecular consequences of TCM formulations and individual herbs can begin to provide such a
map. One view of TCM is that it perturbs multiple targets or pathways with multiple low activity
components to generate relatively strong effects. This is in contrast to the standard approach for
pharmaceutical drug development which seeks to identify single compounds that inhibit a single
pathway or target. However, this method of using one or several active compounds as

representative of single herbs is problematic‚Äã10‚Äã for understanding the roles of individual plant
extracts in TCM formulations. This is illustrated by our results; although containing similar
amounts of the main chemical compounds, CKI has much stronger effects than Kushen extract
alone. Therefore, a formula disassembly approach that uses single herbs is a practical way to
study herbal compatibility. Combined with omics techniques and network analysis, we can
represent the mechanisms of TCM herbal compatibility as interactions between target networks
familiar to Western medicine. In this report, we took CKI, a prescription containing only two
herbs, as a proof of principle. However, related methods can easily be applied to more complex
formulae.

As a frequently used herb, and because it is considered to contain the main bioactive
components in CKI, Kushen or its main alkaloids and flavonoids are commonly used to
represent CKI in studies‚Äã20,21‚Äã. Furthermore, TCM theory also regards Kushen as the primary
herb in CKI. Our results support these hypotheses and TCM theory at different levels. First, at
the chemical level, HPLC profiles showed that the source of most major components in CKI is
Kushen. Second, in terms of overall efficacy, Kushen has much stronger cytotoxic effects than
Baituling on various cell lines. Third, at the gene level, DE genes shared by Kushen and CKI
account for 81% and 63% of total DE genes in Kushen and CKI treatments, and most of them
are consistently up- or down-regulated. Furthermore, important genes are also regulated both
by Kushen and CKI. Cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily A member 1 (CYP1A1) gene, a
steroid metabolizing enzyme which is important for steroid hormone responsive cancers and
shown as the most over-expressed gene with CKI in our previous results, is also highly
overexpressed by Kushen but not Baituling‚Äã22,23‚Äã. Also, the down-regulation of the ‚ÄãTP53‚Äã gene
primarily results from Kushen. Our previously results based on CKI observed cells underwent

apoptosis while expression of ‚ÄãTP53‚Äã decreased, which indicates the apoptosis induced by
Kushen and CKI is not ‚ÄãTP53‚Äã-dependent‚Äã11‚Äã. Finally, GO and KEGG over-representation analysis
also indicated that the genes in major cancer related pathways and terms perturbed by CKI
including cell cycle, DNA replication, and cell migration, are induced by the shared DE gene set
between Kushen and CKI. Taken together, our findings agree with TCM theory which considers
Kushen as the principle herb in CKI, and they map this specific part of TCM theory to effects on
specific genetic networks and pathways.

On the other hand, we could find no Baituling literature and studies on macrozamin to support
its application in CKI‚Äã24‚Äã. From our HPLC and cytotoxic assay results, Baituling injection does not
contain many components and has no significant effects on cancer cells. In addition, NAseq
analysis of Baituling-treated samples are close to the untreated samples in the multidimensional
scaling plot, and only 253 DE genes compared to untreated were detected. However, after
comparing the differences between CKI and Kushen, we found Baituling has a strong
reinforcing effects on Kushen. The SPIA results showed Baituling can enhance many pathways‚Äô
perturbation strength compared to Kushen treatment, including cell cycle, pathways in cancer
and proteoglycans in cancer. In addition, many DE genes in immune-related pathways and GO
terms are over-represented in CKI compared to Kushen. Together with the opposing direction of
perturbation for the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway caused by Kushen and
Baituling, we can conclude Baituling may also contribute to the immune regulatory effects of
CKI. This was confirmed by our measurements of IL-1ùù±, which was significantly up-regulated by
Baituling and CKI. In conclusion, our results indicate that Baituling, an adjuvant herb in CKI
according to TCM theory, may enhance the anticancer effects of Kushen and contribute to
immune regulation.

In conclusion, we explained the TCM herbal compatibility of CKI in the context of pathway
perturbations using transcriptome analysis. Kushen primarily contributes to CKI effects on
cancer cells by perturbing cell cycle regulation and other functions‚Äã11,14‚Äã, meanwhile, Baituling
enhanced potential anticancer effects for Kushen and activated the immune system. Therefore,
the two herbs in CKI collaborate with differences in effects, which is very similar to formulation
theory in TCM. Compared to previous studies on herbal compatibility, our method can explain
the beneficial interaction pattern of herbs in TCM formulae in a more systematic and
comprehensive fashion.

respectively. Cells were cultured overnight before drug treatment and the treatment time was 48
hours for all assays.

Components comparison with HPLC
CKI, Kushen or Baituling injection was diluted 1:20 with MilliQ water and then analyzed on a
photodiode-array UV-Vis detector equipped Shimadzu HPLC (Japan) with a preparative C‚Äã18
column (5 Œºm, 250 x 10 mm, Phenomenex, CA, USA). The recording range is from 200 nm to
280 nm, with monitoring at 215 nm. 0.01M ammonium acetate (adjusted to pH 8.0, solvent A)
and acetonitrile + 0.09 % trifluoroacetic acid (solvent B) were used as mobile phase and flow
rate is 2 ml/min with linear gradient elution (0 min, 100 % A; 60 min, 65 % A, 70 min, 100 % A).
Nine Standard compounds, including Oxymatrine, Oxysophocarpine, N-methylcytisine, Matrine,
Sophocarpine, Trifolirhizin, Adenine, Sophoridine (Beina Biotechnology Institute Co., Ltd,
China), and macrozamin (Zhendong Pharmaceutical Co.Ltd, China), were used to characterize
peaks in the HPLC profile.

Cell viability assay
Cells were cultured and treated in 96-well plates. After 48 hours drug treatment, 50 Œºl of
XTT:PMS (at 1 mg/ml and 1.25 mM, respectively, and combined at 50:1 ratio, Sigma-Aldrich,
MO, USA) was added into each well and incubated 4 hours for the measurement of cell viability.
A Biotrack II microplate reader was used to detect the absorbance at 492 nm.

Apoptosis rate with cell cycle assay
After treatment, cells were harvested from 6-well plates and stained with propidium iodide (PI;

The GO and KEGG over-representation analyses were performed with ClueGO and visualized
with Cytoscape v3.6.0 with following parameters: ‚Äãright-sided hypergeometric test for enrichment
analysis; p values were corrected for multiple testing according to the Benjamini-Hochberg
method and biological process at 3rd level for GO terms‚Äã27,28‚Äã. The ‚ÄãSignalling Pathway Impact
Analysis (SPIA)‚Äã package in R was used to conduct the pathway perturbation analysis‚Äã using all
DE genes(FDR<0.05)‚Äã29‚Äã. ‚ÄãR Pathview package was used to visualize specific KEGG pathways‚Äã30‚Äã.
String (V11.0) was used to identify protein-protein interactions with a threshold of 0.4 for
minimum interaction score‚Äã31‚Äã.

ELISA for IL-1Œ≤ level
A431 cells were treated with different injections for 48 hours in 96-well plates and the cell
culture supernatant was collected and tested for the level of IL-1Œ≤ by ELISA using human
interleukin-1 beta ELISA kit (Biosensis, CA, USA) according to the kit protocol. The ‚Äãabsorbance
at 450nm was detected with Multiskan Ascent Plate Reader.
