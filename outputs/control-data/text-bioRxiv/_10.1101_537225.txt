Abstract
Maturation of sensory systems in mammals is regulated by appropriate sensory stimulation.
Developmental refinement of the eye and visual system is regulated by light and visual
stimulation. One compelling example is that fetal mouse pups deprived of light exhibit altered
vascular development in their eyes. Previous work demonstrated that light activation of the
photopigment melanopsin (Opn4), an atypical opsin expressed in intrinsically photosensitive
retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), is crucial to normal vascular development. This suggested the
unusual hypothesis that vascular development of the eye was regulated by ipRGC responses in
the fetal eye by light that traveled through the body wall of the mother. Here, we test the
requirement of OPN4 during fetal stages using genetic approaches. The G-protein GNAQ (Gaq)
is a candidate mediator of melanopsin signaling. We show that ipRGC-specific deletion of Gnaq
phenocopies both hyaloid and retinal vascular development of the Opn4 null mouse. Furthermore,
GNAQ gain-of-function in Opn4-expressing cells only during late gestation was sufficient to
reverse the consequences for vascular development of either dark rearing or Opn4 loss-offunction. We conclude that melanopsin-dependent signaling in the fetal mouse eye is necessary
and sufficient for vascular maturation.
Introduction
Melanopsin is a G-coupled receptor that, like other opsins1–4, initiates a signaling cascade when
it captures a photon of light. Melanopsin was discovered in the melanophores of the frog Xenopus
laevis5 but is now known to be present in most vertebrates6. In adult mice, melanopsin mediates
circadian entrainment7–10 and the pupillary light reflex9,11. More recently, melanopsin was shown
to be essential for negative phototaxis in neonates12 and for normal vascular development of the
eye13.
In mammals, melanopsin is expressed in so-called intrinsically photosensitive retinal
ganglion cells (ipRGCs). The axons of ipRGCs project to several regions of the brain, such as the
suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)14–18 and the olivary pretectal nucleus11,17,19–22, that are consistent
with the light-sensing physiological functions of melanopsin. It has been shown that melanopsin
expressing cells are photo-sensitive as early as the day of birth (P1) in the mouse23. This is 9
days prior to the emergence of visual signaling from conventional photoreceptors, consistent with
the acute action of melanopsin in the negative phototaxis reflex of mice at P512. Several studies
have demonstrated that ipRGCs express Gnaq/11 subfamily members24–26 and that melanopsin

phototransduction is predominantly mediated by Gnaq/11 coupling24,27,28. Other reports suggest
that melanopsin functions independent of Gnaq/11 both in vivo26 and in vitro29–31. The in vivo
studies were performed in neonatal pups or adult animals, and the nature of melanopsin
phototransduction in fetal retina remains to be explored.
Melanopsin is required for normal vascular development of the mouse eye13. Mice that are
dark reared from E15 or that are Opn4 loss-of-function show promiscuous retinal angiogenesis
and hyaloid vessel persistence13. A model explaining melanopsin-dependent vascular
development suggests that the first step is the suppression of retinal neuron numbers13. It is
proposed that in Opn4 null and dark reared mice, abnormally high numbers of retinal neurons
induce a hypoxia response that results in high expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A,
(VEGFA)13, a key regulator of developmental angiogenesis. In turn, high levels of VEGFA are
proposed to cause promiscuous angiogenesis in the retina as well as to suppress regression of
the hyaloid vessels13. One unusual outcome of this analysis was the proposal, based on staged
dark rearing experiments, that the light response window for melanopsin-dependent vascular
development occurs during gestation between E16 and E1813. This further implied that
melanopsin in the fetal retina would be stimulated by light that traveled through the body wall of
the dam13. Measured levels of light within the visceral cavity of adult female mice were consistent
with this possibility given the threshold photo-sensitivity of ipRGCs23,32,33.
In the current study we have used experimental strategies to address the role of
melanopsin signaling during fetal mouse stages in regulating vascular development in the eye.
We show that gain- and loss-of-function modulation of GNAQ (Gaq) in Opn4-expressing cells
results in changes in vascular development. Importantly, Gnaq loss-of-function phenocopies lossof-function for Opn4 while GNAQ gain-of-function restricted to fetal Opn4-expressing cells
reverses the vascular consequences of dark rearing and Opn4 loss-of-function. These data make
a strong case that melanopsin function via GNAQ signaling during fetal stages is necessary and
sufficient for vascular maturation in the eye. Given the OPN4 gene is expressed at gestational
week 9 in human eyes34, these findings also raise the very interesting possibility that this same
pathway may be conserved in the human fetus.

employ GNAQ for melanopsin phototransduction, then a deletion of Gnaq in Opn4-expressing
cells in mice should reproduce the vascular development phenotype of the Opn4 null13. To test
this, we combined the Opn4cre allele with Gnaqfl (officially Gnaqtm2Soff) but also included the germline loss-of-function Gna11 allele because GNAQ and GNA11 frequently function together. To
assess the consequences of deletion of GNAQ and GNA11 in Opn4-expressing cells, we

immunofluorescence detection of GNAQ and GNA11. ipRGCs in the retina were identified by the
expression of tdTomato from the Ai14 cre reporter (Fig. 1A-E). Use of a single antibody that
detects both GNAQ and GNA11 on cryosections from retina revealed that control ipRGCs showed
membrane immunoreactivity (Fig. 1A-E), but almost all those from mice with combined Gna11
and Gnaq mutations did not (Fig. 1F-H). A few ipRGCs retained GNAQ/11 labeling (Fig. 1G, H,
red arrow) and probably represent cells that did not recombine both Gnaqfl alleles in response to
Opn4cre. With this evidence for GNAQ/11 loss in ipRGCs, we analyzed the eyes of mutant mice
for vascular anomalies.
The hyaloid vessels are fetal blood vessels that reside transiently between lens and retina.
These vessels undergo a maturational regression, presumably as an adaptation to clear the visual
axis for high-acuity vision. In the mouse this occurs between postnatal (P) days 1 and 1035. Counts
of vessel numbers at P8 provides a simple and reliable read-out for regression activity13,36. In P8
Gnaqfl/+; Gna11+/- control mice, we observed hyaloid vessel numbers consistent with a normal
rate of regression (Fig. 2A-C)13,36. By contrast, Opn4cre; Gnaqfl/+ and Opn4cre; Gnaqfl/fl both showed
hyaloid persistence. Deleting both alleles of Gnaq produced the highest level of persistence
suggesting a gene dose-dependence (Fig. 2A-C). The addition of Gna11 germ-line homozygosity
to Gnaq conditional deletion in ipRGCs did not further elevate hyaloid vessel number at P8 (Fig.
2C). These data suggest GNAQ is required in Opn4-expressing cells for activity of the pathway
that controls hyaloid regression. The data also suggest that GNA11 is unlikely to be a significant
contributor.
As previously shown Opn4 deletion results in persistent hyaloid vessels at P813. For
comparison purposes we also show here that Opn4 homozygote null mice show a significant
elevation in the number of hyaloid vessels (Fig. 2D). The absolute numbers of hyaloid vessels in
control animals shown in Fig. 2C and 2D is distinct and this very likely reflects differences in strain
background. Namely, the data in Fig. 2C are the result of a mixed background cross and that in
Fig. 2D is C57BL/6 background. Any changes in hyaloid vessel number are thus best compared
as a proportion of the value from littermate controls. When we express hyaloid vessel number for
both the germline Opn4 and conditional Gnaq mutants as a proportion of control (white numbers,

Figs. 2C, D), we find that GNAQ loss-of-function produces a phenotype that is at least as severe
as that for OPN4. This argues that for this vascular development pathway GNAQ activity can fully
account for the signaling activity of OPN4.
During the postnatal period in mice, the retina becomes vascularized through a process
of angiogenesis in part driven by VEGFA37. In the Opn4 null mouse, retinal angiogenesis is
promiscuous and the vascular networks show elevated density and ectopic sprouts13. For this
reason we also assessed development of the retinal vasculature in the Gna11-, Gnaqfl, Opn4cre
allelic series. Counts of branch-points revealed a gene dosage-dependent elevation in vascular
density (Fig. 2E-G) but, as with the hyaloid vessel phenotype, no apparent contribution from
GNA11. When we compared the phenotype severity for GNAQ and OPN4 loss-of-function (as
proportion of control, white number Figs. 2G, H), as with the hyaloid vessel phenotype, we found
that GNAQ can fully account for the activity of OPN4. Combined, the hyaloid vessel and retinal
angiogenesis phenotypes of mice with GNAQ loss-of-function in Opn4-expressing cells suggest
that OPN4 signaling for this vascular development pathway is coupled through GNAQ.

Activation of GNAQ at fetal stages reverses the vascular consequences of Opn4 loss-offunction.
To further assess the relationship between light responses, OPN4, GNAQ and vascular
development, we determined whether we could reverse the vascular consequences of darkrearing or Opn4 mutation by activating GNAQ signaling only in Opn4-expressing cells. We
designed these experiments so that we could activate GNAQ only during late gestation and in
fetal mice, not in the pregnant dam. This addressed the question of whether OPN4-dependent
signaling responses occurred in fetal mice.
For these experiments, we employed a ROSA26-based allele expressing hM3Dq38, a
DREADD (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs) based on a G-coupled
receptor that activates GNAQ in response to the small molecule ligand CNO39. By activating R26hM3Dq with Opn4cre (Fig. 3A), we could obtain expression in Opn4-expressing cells and by
injecting CNO into the dam in late gestation (Fig. 3B), we could restrict GNAQ activation to fetal
stages. We also performed crosses that excluded the possibility of GNAQ activation in the dam.
We used this experimental strategy to generate a series of control and experimental mice that
were assessed for both hyaloid vessel regression and retinal vascular density.
For experiments to determine whether GNAQ activation could reverse the vascular
consequences of Opn4 loss-of-function, we crossed an Opn4cre/cre; R26-hM3Dq male with an
Opn4+/- female. This provided appropriate control and experimental genotypes in fetal mice but

excluded the possibility that the dam could respond to CNO. We then injected CNO daily from
E16 to day of birth (P1) and harvested retina and hyaloid at P8 for quantification of vascular
structures. As expected, Opn4cre/- pups showed hyaloid persistence at P8 (Fig. 3C, and the dark
gray bar in G). By contrast, Opn4cre/-; R26-hM3Dq pups injected with CNO showed a normal
number of hyaloid vessels (Fig. 3D, and the dark blue bar in G). Similarly, Opn4cre/- animals
showed an abnormally elevated retinal vascular density at P8 (Fig. 3F, H) and this was reversed
when Opn4cre/- was combined with R26-hM3Dq and gestational CNO (Fig. 3F, H). These data
show that for the vascular development pathways in the eye, GNAQ activity can substitute for
OPN4 within ipRGCs. The experiment also makes a strong case that this vascular development
pathway is dependent on the activity of melanopsin at fetal stages.
Activation of GNAQ in ipRGCs at fetal stages reverses the vascular consequences of dark
rearing.
As a second step in this analysis, we determined whether fetal stage GNAQ activation could
reverse the vascular consequences of dark-rearing (DD, Fig. 3B). For this analysis, we crossed
a male Opn4cre/cre homozygote with a female R26-hM3Dq heterozygote. This meant that half the
fetal mice had expression activation of hM3Dq in melanopsin-expressing neurons, but
importantly, the dam did not carry Opn4cre and therefore could not activate expression of R26hM3Dq. Thus, any response to the CNO ligand could only be attributed to fetal Opn4-expressing
cells. When we performed the analysis, we found that CNO injected into pregnant female mice
from E15 through E19 reversed the vascular consequences of dark rearing (Fig. 4A-H). As
expected, DD conditions resulted in significantly elevated hyaloid vessel numbers at P8 (Fig. 4A,
C, D). In the absence of late gestational injections of CNO the elevated number of hyaloid vessels
was not significantly changed with or without hM3Dq (Fig. 4C, D). However, when CNO was
injected from E15 to E19 into DD, Opn4cre; R26-hM3Dq mice, the normally elevated number of
hyaloid vessels remained at the level observed in the LD control (compare Fig. 4E, blue bar with
4C, both bars). When we quantified retinal vascular branch-points (Fig. 4F, G, H), we observed a
very similar pattern where Opn4cre, R26-hM3Dq, and gestational CNO were all required to reverse
the retinal vascular overgrowth of DD to control levels (Fig. 4H). These data indicate that activation
of GNAQ signaling in Opn4-expressing cells can substitute for light in late gestation and give
normal regulation of vascular development.

Discussion
Here we have combined experimental strategies to address the question of whether melanopsin
activation during fetal stages can regulate vascular development in the mouse eye. Within the
retina, OPN4 expression is restricted to a subset of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that are, in adult
mice, intrinsically photosensitive9,14,40. Opn4 is expressed as early as E10.534 and OPN4 protein
is detected in the retina around E1541 in mouse embryos. Like other opsins, melanopsin (aka
Opsin 4, OPN4) is a G-coupled receptor29,42 and functions predominantly via Gnaq/11
coupling24,27,28. Few studies have suggested alternate G-protein coupling for melanopsin in both
in vivo26 and in expression systems29–31. Current data on melanopsin G-protein coupling is from
adult or neonatal mice. We focused our efforts on late gestational ages and our data indicates
that melanopsin in the fetal retina uses conventional Gnaq/11-coupling for ocular vascular
development.
In the first step of this analysis, we determined whether the loss of GNAQ function in Opn4expressing cells produced the same phenotype as a melanopsin (OPN4) loss-of-function. We
show mice with the Opn4cre; Gnaqfl/fl genotype had the retinal vascular overgrowth and hyaloid
vessel persistence characteristic of the Opn4 null and of dark rearing from late gestation13.
Furthermore, the addition of germ-line Gna11 homozygosity to Gnaq conditional deletion from
Opn4-expressing cells did not exacerbate vascular phenotypes. These data argue that GNAQ,
and not GNA11, mediates melanopsin-dependent vascular development. As a final step in this
series of experiments we determined whether GNAQ gain of function was sufficient to reverse
the vascular phenotypes that result from dark rearing or from Opn4 mutation. We tested whether
GNAQ activation in Opn4-expressing cells only during the fetal stages of mouse development
was sufficient to reverse the vascular changes that normally result from dark rearing or Opn4 lossof-function. Our findings showed that when GNAQ gain-of-function was restricted to Opn4expressing cells in late mouse gestation, this was sufficient to overcome the absence of light or
the absence of OPN4 for the vascular development pathway.
These data thus make a strong case that if the vascular development of a mouse eye is
to be normal, GNAQ must be activated in Opn4-expressing cells from E16 to E19 of gestation.
The ability to revert the Opn4 loss-of-function phenotype with conditional activation of GNAQ also
suggests that the activity of OPN4 and GNAQ in Opn4-expressing cells are directly related. The
ability to revert the vascular consequences of dark rearing also indicate that the fetal retina
normally responds to environmental light. We show that the fetal light response pathway
regulating vascular development requires GNAQ but not GNA11 (Fig. 2). Involvement of GNA14

in the fetal ipRGC response remains a possibility though this is unlikely given the quantitative
correspondence between Opn4 and Gnaq loss-of-function.
Multiple members of the Gnaq/11 subfamily, including Gna14, Gnaq and Gna11, can
participate in melanopsin phototransduction in vivo24,27,28. However, a recent study showed that
Opn4cre; Gna11-/-; Gnaqfl/fl mice like those used here, many of the photic responses ascribed to
melanopsin remain normal26. The present analysis, showing that GNA11 does not contribute to
vascular development responses, is consistent with the documented lack of a multielectrode array
response in the neonatal retina of Gna11; Gna14 null mice26. However, the Gnaq loss-of-function
phenotype, coupled to the rescue of the OPN4 loss-of-function phenotype by GNAQ gain-offunction, makes a compelling case that GNAQ is an important signaling mediator of OPN4 activity
in fetal stages and is consistent with the observation of GNAQ presence in all M1-5 ipRGCs in
adult mice24. One possible explanation for these apparently discrepant findings is that different
functions of melanopsin are mediated by distinct types of signaling response and are likely to be
age-specific. One scenario is that perhaps the vascular development pathway assessed here
relies on the activity of GNAQ while the pupillary reflex and circadian photoentrainment rely on
other G-proteins that are expressed at a later stage of ipRGC development.
The data presented here make a strong case that the eye of a fetal mouse uses light as
normal developmental cue. Though we currently do not understand the biological rationale with
precision, it is quite likely that the fetal eye light response prepares the eye for visual function.
Certainly, vascular development of the eye must be closely regulated for normal vision but it is
also likely that other responses to fetal OPN4 stimulation will be identified. OPN4 is highly
conserved within the vertebrates both in primary sequence and function. This raises the
fascinating possibility that the human fetal eye is also light responsive in a way that regulates
vascular development. This idea has received support from a recent clinical study that associates
first trimester fetal light exposure with severe forms of retinopathy of prematurity, an ocular blood
vessel overgrowth of the premature infant43.

Materials and Methods
Animals
All animal experimentation was carried out using protocols approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center. Mouse lines used in
this study have been previously described: Opn4cre(ref44) Opn4- (ref10), Ai14 (JAX #007914) ,
Gnaqfl (ref45), Gna11 (ref45) and R26-LSL-Gq-DREADD (ref38). Genotyping information is
described in the cited publications. Mice were housed in a 12:12 hour light-dark (LD) cycle. For
dark-rearing experiments, pregnant dam was moved to constant darkness (DD) after lights OFF
at E15. Clozapine-N-oxide (CNO, Sigma #CO832-5MG) stock solution was prepared at 10 mg/ml
in 100% DMSO and injected into the dam at 1 mg/kg body weight to activate Gq-DREADD
(hM3Dq). Dam was injected daily at lights ON in LD cycle or at subjective lights ON for animals
in DD from embryonic day E16 to day of birth. For DD animals, injections were performed under
dim red light. Littermate controls were used for all experiments to accommodate for differences in
mouse strains.
Hyaloid and retinal labeling
Hyaloid vessel and retinal flat-mount preparations have been previously described (Rao 2013).
Hyaloid preparations and retinae were labeled with Hoechst 33258 and isolectin (1:500, Thermo
Fisher Scientific #I21411), respectively. Hyaloid vessel quantification has been described
previously (Rao 2013). Retinal vessel density was quantified by counting vessel junctions using
ImageJ for at least ten 320µm2 fields per retina. We used paired T-test to assess statistical
significance. In the G-protein immunohistochemical study, retinae for cryosections were fixed at
room temperature for 2 hours in 4% PFA and then cryopreserved in 30% sucrose and sectioned
at 10 µm followed by antigen retrieval with ice cold sodium citrate buffer for 10 minutes. Sections
and flat-mounts were incubated in anti-GNAQ/GNA11 (1:100, Santa Cruz sc-392) at 4oC for 1-3
days followed by secondary antibody (1:500, Thermo Fisher Scientific #A-21206) overnight at
4oC.

Figure 1. GNAQ loss-of-function in ipRGCs can be generated with Opn4cre.
(A-E) Cryosections from P2, Gna11+/-; Gnaq+/+; Ai14; Opn4cre mice were labeled for nuclei (A, B, blue, C,
grayscale), tdTomato (A, B, red, D, grayscale) and GNAQ/11 (B, green, E, grayscale, A no primary antibody
control). C-E represent different channels from region demarcated in (B). In (E, yellow dashed lines),
GNAQ/11 labeling is associated with the membrane of three ipRGCs according to the presence of
tdTomato as shown in (D, yellow dashed lines). (F-H) Cryosections from E18, Gna11+/-; Gnaqfl/fl; Ai14;
Opn4cre mice were labeled for nuclei (F, blue), tdTomato (F, red, G, grayscale) or for GNAQ (F, green, H,
grayscale). G-H represent different channels from region demarcated in (F). In (H), the cells labeled 1-4
are ipRGCs according to the expression of tdTomato (G). Unlike ipRGCs in the control sections (D, E),
cells 1 and 2 (G, H, yellow dashed line) do not show GNAQ/11 membrane labeling. Cells 3 and 4 (G, H,
red arrowhead) show some GNAQ labeling and may therefore have escaped cre-mediated deletion of both
Gnaqfl alleles. NBL neuroblast layer, IPL inner plexiform layer, GC ganglion layer
