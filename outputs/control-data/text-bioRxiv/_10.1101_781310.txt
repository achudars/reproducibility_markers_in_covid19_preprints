Abstract
The number of mutations that occur per nucleotide per generation varies between species by
several orders of magnitude. In multicellular eukaryotes, the per generation mutation rate
depends both on the per cell division mutation rate and on the number of germline cell
divisions per generation. In a range of species, from fungi to humans, the number of germline
cell divisions is lower than that of somatic cells, reducing the mutation burden on the
offspring. The basidiomycete ​
Schizophyllum commune ​has the highest level of genetic

polymorphism known among eukaryotes. In a previous study, it was also found to have a
high per generation mutation rate, probably contributing to its high polymorphism. However,
this rate has been measured only in a breeding experiment on Petri dishes, and it is unclear
how this result translates to natural populations. Here, we used an experimental design that
measures the rate of accumulation of ​

nucleotide per meter of growth, which is 3 orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding
rates in the oak ​Quercus robur​and the fungus ​Armillaria gallica​. This figure is consistent
with the estimate obtained before, and suggests the lack of a dedicated germline in this
system. If so, e​ven a low per cell division mutation rate​can translate into a very high per
generation mutation rate when the number of cell divisions between consecutive meioses is
large.

Introduction
Mutation rate is the key parameter of evolution. Fortunately, the development of
next-generation sequencing technologies made it possible to measure mutations rates directly,
and the data on different species are accumulating rapidly. Per nucleotide per generation

mutation rate varies greatly between species, from ~10​-8​to ~10​-10​-10​
, with multicellular

-11​
eukaryotes tending to have higher rates (~10​-8​-10​
) than unicellular organisms (~10​-9​-10​
)

(Lynch et al. 2016)​. This is at least partially due to multiple cell divisions that occur in the
course of a single generation in multicellular organisms. Indeed, the per generation mutation

rate in a multicellular organism is a product of the mutation rate per cell division and the
number of mitoses between two consecutive meioses. Thus, as long as germ line cell
divisions keep occurring in the course of life of an individual, as in males of mammals, the
number of mutations passed onto offspring increases with the age of reproduction, can
produce a correlation between the age at reproduction ​(Kong et al. 2012)​. Still, many species
have a dedicated germline, in which the number of cell divisions is restricted; for example,
the number of mutations passed to offspring by a human mother depends on her age only
slightly ​(Jónsson et al. 2017)​, probably because maternal germline does not divide for most of
her life.
Moreover, even in species seemingly characterized by linear growth, the rate of accumulation
of point mutations with spatial distance within a single individual is unexpectedly low,
suggesting that a subset of cells is protected from mutations unusually well or undergoes a
very low number of cell divisions. In plants, the number of mutations accumulated per
generation was found to be independent of vegetative growth in ​Arabidopsis; ​and the number
of nucleotide differences between remote branches of the same oak tree was unexpectedly
low, also consistent with the presence of a dedicated germline ​(Schmid-Siegert et al. 2017)​
.
Recently, a study of a giant ​Armillaria​fungus revealed a remarkably low number of
nucleotide differences between its spatially remote parts ​(Anderson James B. et al. 2018)​.
The mechanism for this fidelity is unknown; the options include intercalary growth, very long
cells, or very low mutation rate per replication.
While the mutation rate per generation can be easily measured by comparing individuals,
measuring the mutation rate per cell division is harder. In multicellulars, this could be
achieved by either direct sequencing of a cell and its offspring, or two cells separated by a

known number of cell divisions. However, single-cell sequencing is still in its infancy, and it
is hard to track cell lineages within an individual, which complicates estimating the number
of cell divisions separating two points of an organism.
Mycelial fungi are characterized by linear mycelial growth, possibly simplifying this task.
Still, making use of this advantage is difficult. First, the exact linear distance between points
of a mycelium can only be measured in a lab, and many fungi cannot be cultivated well.
Second, it is still not known how the number of cell divisions scales with linear distance.
Third, fungi often have multinuclear cells, complicating measurements and analysis.
To better understand the link between the somatic accumulation of mutations during growth
and their contribution to the per generation mutation rate, we take advantage of a
basidiomycete wood-decay fungus ​Schizophyllum commune​. ​S. commune ​is characterized by
the highest genetic diversity among all studied species, with nucleotide diversity reaching
20% within a single population ​(Baranova et al. 2015)​. The cause of this remains unclear.
-8​
Although the per-generation substitution rate is quite high (2.0​⋅​10​
per nucleotide)

(Baranova et al. 2015)​, it is not extreme ​(Lynch et al. 2016)​. One reason for the extreme
genetic diversity might be a very large effective population size. Besides, the per generation
mutation rate in ​(Baranova et al. 2015)​could have been lower than that in natural
populations. In that work, two fungal mycelia were cultivated, crossed and formed fruit
bodies on a Petri dish, and there was only ~10 cm of mycelial growth between generations. In
nature, this distance may be much higher. If somatic mutations constantly accumulate during
mycelial growth, this can lead to much higher per-generation mutation rates in nature than in
the lab.

Here, we present an experimental study of accumulation of substitutions in a mycelium of ​S.
commune​over a long period of linear growth. The life cycle of ​S. commune​includes a
mononuclear haploid stage which originates from a single spore ​(Schmid-Siegert et al. 2017;
Hanlon 2018)​. At this stage, it can be relatively easily cultivated on solid media, where it
grows vegetatively without producing fruit bodies. The mycelium of ​S. commune​grows
linearly and apically in cell-thick hyphae ​(Gooday 1995)​
; the cell length is known, and
comprises approximately 100 µm ​(Essig 1922)​
. Knowing the number of cell divisions
between two points of the mycelium, it is easy to estimate the rate of mutation accumulation
per cell division. We have developed an experimental system in which haploid mycelia of ​S.
commune ​are cultivated in long tubes of a fixed diameter. Under these conditions, mycelia
maintain an approximately constant number of hyphae at any given section of the tube, which
depends on the tube diameter. We used two types of tubes: narrow (diameter 0.8 mm) that
can maintain simultaneous growth of tens of hyphae; and thick (diameter 4 mm) that maintain
thousands of hyphae. Narrow tubes minimize the number of hyphae, eliminating any possible
competition between them and therefore selection against new mutations, while thick tubes
allow to study the accumulation of substitutions under conditions presumably similar to the
natural ones.

Results
New approach: experimental system for measuring mutation rate in a linearly growing
mycelium. ​We developed an experimental system that allows us to cultivate haploid mycelia
for a long period of time, maintaining strictly vegetative mode of growth and

haplospore which gave rise to a haploid mycelium with mononuclear cells ​(Stankis et al.
1990)​
, and was then cultivated in glass tubes of a fixed diameter on solid medium. We
regularly measured growth rates of the mycelia along the tube, and took samples for
sequencing. We also sequenced all founding cultures and performed genome assembly for
each culture individually. Sequenced samples of derived cultures were then mapped to
corresponding assemblies; this was done to achieve good mapping quality, as mapping on an

assembly of a different individual is difficult because of the high genetic diversity of ​S.
commune​​(Baranova et al. 2015)​.
We used tubes of two different diameters. Narrow tubes had the inner diameter of
approximately 0.8 mm, with its width partially filled with solid medium. Thick tubes
comprised a cylinder of solid medium 4 mm in diameter, placed within a glass tube with a
slightly larger inner diameter (Fig. 1A). The tubes were approximately 15-20 cm long, and
cultures were transferred to the next tube as soon as the hyphae reached the end of the tube.
In the case of narrow tubes, this procedure by itself did not always yield successful replanting
because the number of transferred cells was too small. Therefore, before the transfer to the
next tube, cultures were cultivated on Petri dishes for some time to obtain enough material.
The overall period of growth on the Petri dish was ~20 times shorter than that in the tubes,
and was not counted towards the overall growth time of the corresponding mycelium. For
transfer, we then attempted to sample cells from the same position of the Petri dish where the
culture was planted, minimizing the number of mutations accumulated on the Petri dish. At
the time of transfer, mycelial samples were also collected for sequencing. The overall
experimental layout is shown in Fig. 1B.
Experimental lines. ​We used four founding haploid cultures, each originated from a single
haplospore. Three of the cultures (sh01, sh02, sh03) were obtained from fruit bodies collected
in Florida, USA, and one culture (sh04), from a fruit body collected in Kostroma Oblast’,
Russia. Each founding culture was used to plant six experimental lines in tubes of two
different diameters (three replicates in each), for a total of 24 experimental lines. We
cultivated them for between 220 and 360 days. The mean growth rate in the thick tubes (5.9
mm/day) was almost twice as high as in the narrow tubes (3.5 mm/day). Cultures have grown

still, a number of mutations have reached high frequencies but were then lost, and some
mutations have never reached high frequencies (Table 1). In each line, the vast majority of
mutations that were observed at the last time point (72-100%) were fixed. In both types of
tubes, the fraction of fixed nonsynonymous or coding mutations was not different from that
expected if they occurred irrespective of their genic/nongenic position and synonimicity
(Supplementary Fig. 1A, 1B). Nevertheless, among coding mutations, the overall dN/dS ratio
was somewhat lower in thick tubes (0.7) than in narrow tubes (1.0), although the difference
was not significant.
By the end of the experiment, between 2 and 29 mutations have reached frequencies over
70% in each line, with the mean value of 9 mutations. The dynamics of this accumulation is
shown in Fig. 4. We saw no change in the mutation rate over the course of mycelial growth
(ANOVA test, P-value = 0.104; Supplementary Fig. S1).
The length of a cell in a growing mycelium of ​S. commune ​has been previously estimated as

Discussion
Even in species with a dedicated germline and a well-defined life cycle such as humans, the
mutation rate per generation can differ greatly between parent-offspring pairs due to
differences in the number of germline cell divisions ​(Kong et al. 2012)​. In the absence of a
dedicated germline, this value is expected to scale with generation length, and can depend
substantially on the mode of growth in the field, or cultivation in the lab.
In our experiment, mutations accumulate linearly with the number of cell divisions, so that
their number is proportional to the mycelium length (Fig. 2). The mutation accumulation rate
varies both between lines and tube sizes. Assuming that the process of mycelial growth in
nature is better represented by thick than by narrow tubes, we estimate the substitution

substitutions/nucleotide/m. Given the genome size of 38Mb ​(Ohm et al. 2010)​, this
corresponds to ~5.4 substitutions per 1 m per genome.
This estimate seems broadly consistent with that obtained previously ​(Baranova et al. 2015)​.
In that work, the per generation mutation rate during growth on a Petri dish was estimated as
-8​
2​⋅​10​
substitutions/nucleotide/generation. Although the exact amount of mycelial growth

between generations was not measured in that experiment, it was roughly ~10 cm, giving the
-7 ​
mutation accumulation rate of ~2​⋅​10​
substitutions/nucleotide/m, or ~7.6

substitutions/genome/m, which is similar to our results.
The limited available data on other multicellular species suggest that linear accumulation of
mutations with linear growth is probably unusual. We investigated the data obtained in
(Anderson James B. et al. 2018)​and found that the per meter mutation accumulation rate tend
to significantly decrease with distance (Fig. S3).
Multicellulars tend to have some type of dedicated germine, resulting in sub-linear scaling of
the number of mutations (and, presumably, cell divisions) with linear distance, and in
moderate per-generation mutation rates. It is hard to compare mutation rate estimates between
studies, as the number of cell divisions is usually unknown. Still, the mutation rate per unit
linear growth in ​S. commune​seems high. In oak, a comparison of parts of the same tree
-10​
yielded the mutation rate estimate of ~3.3​⋅​10​
mutations/nucleotide/m ​(Schmid-Siegert et al.

2017)​
, or ~3.3​

mutations/nucleotide/generation for an oak 10 meters high. Given that the

oak genome (750 Mb) ​(Plomion et al. 2016)​is ~20 times larger than that of ​S. commune,​the
per genome, per generation mutation rate of a 10 m oak (5 substitutions) is similar to that of a
1 m ​S. commune ​(5.4 substitutions)​. ​The per meter mutation rate in an ​Armillaria​fungus is

lower than 5​⋅​10​

genome, this results in a mutation rate of ~0.04 mutations per genome per 1 meter, lower than
that of ​S. commune.
Although being higher that in previously studied fungi and plants, the per cell division
mutation accumulation rate is lower the somatic mutation rates in human and mice, being
rather closer to the germline mutation rates. In ​(Milholland et al. 2017)​, the median germline
-11 ​
-10 ​
mutation rates were estimated at 3.3​⋅​10​
and 1.2​⋅​10​
mutations per nucleotide per mitosis

for humans and mice, respectively, while the somatic mutation rates (in fibroblasts) were
-9 ​
-9​
estimated at 2.66​⋅​10​
and 8.1​⋅​10​
.

Even though the per mitosis mutation rate in S. commune appeared to be quite moderate, the
linear scaling of the number of accumulated mutations with distance may result in a very
large per generation mutation rates if the mycelium growth spans large distances. If the
mutations continue to accumulate linearly, a distance between fruiting bodies of ~1 m can
result in a per generation mutation rate of the order of 10​-7​substitutions/nucleotide, which is
an order of magnitude higher than that in any species known ​(Lynch et al. 2016)​; and if this
distance is larger, this rate can be even higher.
Such a high per generation mutation rate might contribute to the extreme genetic diversity of
S. commune​. In addition, if the variability in mycelial length between fruiting bodies in ​S.
commune​is high, which is observed in other basidiomycetes ​(Anderson James B. et al. 2018)​,
linear accumulation of mutations may result in high variability of the per generation mutation
rate between parent-offspring pairs.
The mutation rate differs strongly between founding cultures, and these differences are
consistent between replicas (Fig. 5), implying that they are at least partly determined by the

genotype of the fungus. The rate in the culture from the Russian population (sh04) was larger
than those in cultures collected from North American populations (sh01, sh02, sh03). This is
unexpected, since the genetic diversity in the Russian population is lower than that in the
North American populations ​(Baranova et al. 2015)​. The differences in diversity levels
between the two populations are therefore not explainable by their different mutation rates
per unit length, and may instead arise from differences in other factors such as effective
population size or length of mycelia.
The rate at which mutations accumulate can be affected by selection discriminating between
the growing hyphae. As selection is expected to be more efficient in larger populations
(Kimura 1983)​, we expect its effect to be more pronounced in thick than in narrow tubes. Our
data provide suggestive evidence for such selection. First, the mutation accumulation rate is
lower in thick tubes than in narrow tubes, consistent with negative selection ridding the
population of some of the hyphae carrying deleterious mutations in thick tubes. Second, the
mycelium growth rate decreases over the course of the experiment in the narrow tubes,
consistent with accumulation of deleterious mutations in them that decrease the growth rate;
but it remains constant in thick tubes, consistent with negative selection purging these
mutations. Third, the dN/dS ratio among the accumulated mutations in thick tubes (but not in
narrow tubes) appears to be lower than 1, although the difference is not statistically
significant. If such selection indeed operates in nature, then the actual per-generation number
of mutations distinguishing the parental and offspring individuals of ​S. commune ​can be
shaped not just by the mutation rate and the number of cell divisions, but also by the extent of
competition between hyphae within a mycelium. Selection between germ line cell lineages is
not unprecedented and has been observed before, for example, as competition between sperm
lines in multiple species including humans, other mammals and birds ​(Ramm et al. 2014)​and

samples and founding cultures were stored at 4ºС and -20ºС.
Whole-genome sequencing. ​Before DNA extraction, samples of mycelium were first grown
in liquid medium (beer wort Maltax10 – 8 g, water – 1 l) on shaker to reach sufficient mass,
and then were lyophilized. DNA was extracted using CTAB method ​

Variant calling. ​Pair-end​​reads trimmed using Trimmomatic were mapped onto
corresponding reference assemblies using bowtie2 ​
(Langmead and Salzberg 2012)​
. Only
reads with properly mapped pair and with mapping quality 42 were kept. Duplicate reads
were removed using Picard Tools ​(Broad Institute)​
.​
De novo​single nucleotide mutations in
experimental lines were called as follows. First, all positions with at least one read supporting
the non-reference base were listed. At these positions, we called variants that had the
following properties: (i) not supported by any read in the reference sequence; (ii) at least in
one sample, coverage in the 10-90% range and alternative variant frequency >30%, or
coverage in the 15-85% range and alternative variant frequency >20%. For these variants, we
assessed their frequencies in all samples.
Dn/Ds ratio and expected distributions of the number of nonsynonymous and coding
mutations. ​Dn/Ds ratio was calculated using codeml program from PAML software ​(Yang
2007)​with the following options: runmode = 0, seqtype = 1, CodonFreq = 2, clock = 0,
model = 0, NSsites = 0, icode = 0, fix_kappa = 0, kappa = 2, fix_omega = 0, omega = 2,
fix_alpha = 1, alpha = .0, Malpha = 0, ncatG = 4. To estimate the expected distributions of
the number of nonsynonymous or coding substitutions, we counted the single-nucleotide
mutations of each of the 12 substitution types (A->G, A->C, …, T->C). In each of the 10000
permutation trials, we then redistributed these mutations across the genome, and obtained the
distribution of the number of nonsynonymous or coding mutations.
