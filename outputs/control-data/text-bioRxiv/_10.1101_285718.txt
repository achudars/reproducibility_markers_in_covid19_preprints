Abstract
Two primary functions attributed to the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex network are
retaining the temporal and spatial associations of events and detecting deviant events. It
is, however, unclear how these two functions converge onto one mechanism. Here, we
tested whether increased activity with perceiving salient events is a deviant detection
signal or contains information about the event associations by reflecting the magnitude of
deviance (i.e., event saliency). We also tested how the deviant detection signal is affected
by the degree of anticipation. We studied regional neural activity when people watched a
movie that had varying saliency of a novel or an anticipated flow of salient events. Using
intracranial electroencephalography from ten patients, we observed that high-frequency
activity (50-150 Hz) in the hippocampus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dorsolateral PFC),
and medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) tracked event saliency. We also observed that
medial OFC activity was stronger when the salient events were anticipated than when
they were novel. These results suggest that dorsolateral PFC and medial OFC, as well
as the hippocampus, signify the saliency magnitude of events, reflecting the hierarchical
structure of event associations.

Introduction
‘I was waiting at home for my friend. I made some tea, washed the cups, and poured hot
water. Then I felt everything shaking. It was an earthquake. I put the cup down and waited
to see if there was an aftershock. Just about then, my friend arrived.’ We experience the
world as a sequence of event, but we remember them as segmented sequences. During
encoding, perceiving unusual events separates the flow of events, i.e., an event
segmentation process (Zacks and Swallow, 2007; Zacks et al., 2007) so that each
segment contains the relationship of events that occurred in a similar circumstance
(Zwaan and Radvansky, 1998). In this process, sequences of events are organized to
create a hierarchical relationship (Kurby and Zacks, 2008; Zacks and Swallow, 2007;
Zwaan and Radvansky, 1998), where a sequence of less notable events are embedded
in an overriding structure of segmented sequences (Hanson and Hirst, 1989, 1989). In
this example, making some tea was embedded in a friend’s visiting. We hypothesized
that a basic model to support the hierarchical relationship of sequences relies on the
magnitude of event deviancy. In principle, the hierarchical relationship can be
reconstructed from event saliency where less salient events are more temporally
associated with prior events than more salient new events (Figure 1C, also see Yeung et
al., 1996).
The magnitude of deviance of events is referred to as “event saliency” and is quantified
by crowdsourcing. Previously event saliency has been used to determine the probability
of a deviant event in a linguistic experiment (Coulson et al., 1998) but recently, with the
availability of videos and advances in computer vision, this term is used for quantifying
the magnitude of deviation in a flow of a movie. Event saliency is not determined by

changes in a visual scene but relies on following the movies and noting significant
changes in the flow of events (Rosani et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2017). Accordingly, event
saliency is measured by either asking an independent group to identify the boundaries
or, in linguistics, studying the transition from one word to another, that is extracted from
a large body of literature.
Both event association and deviancy detection are linked to the hippocampus, OFC, and
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) (Knight, 1996; Nobre et al., 1999; Paz et al., 2010;
Zacks et al., 2007). We reasoned deviant detection reflects event saliency; this signal
would also reflect a temporal association of events. Here we tested the prediction that
high-frequency neural activity in subregions of the PFC and the hippocampus tracked
event saliency.
The PFC-hippocampal neural network is also engaged in prospective coding (Brown et
al., 2016; Hindy et al., 2016; Hsieh and Ranganath, 2015; Hsieh et al., 2014; Jafarpour
et al., 2017) that enhances event segmentation (Schütz-Bosbach and Prinz, 2007). Note
that anticipated salient events are different from novel events. For example, a salient
event like a friend’s planned visiting is anticipated, whereas, a salient event such as an
earthquake is novel. Here, we predicted that the neural representation of event saliency
would be different for novel and predictable salient events.
Generating sequences of novel events in an experimental condition is challenging
(Zarcone et al., 2016). Previous studies have used a discrete experimental design,
comparing the neural activity at the time of perceiving deviant events, i.e., eventboundaries (Kurby and Zacks, 2008), to the neural activity at the time of perceiving non-

boundary events (Speer et al., 2007; Whitney et al., 2009; Zacks et al., 2007). However,
after encountering the first few deviant events participants anticipate the new events;
thus, the later deviant events are no longer novel; instead, they become anticipated
salient events. A flow of events, such as observed in a movie, has numerous eventboundaries with a range of anticipated or novel saliency providing an ideal experimental
design to address this issue.
We recorded local field potential using intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) from
ten patients with epilepsy, who had electrodes implemented for clinical purposes. Patients
passively watched a movie (Figure 1). The analysis focused on the local activity captured
as the power in the high-frequency activity (HFA, 50 – 150 Hz) that serves as a metric for
local neural activation (Belitski et al., 2008; Jacobs and Kahana, 2009; Lachaux et al.,
2012; Ray et al., 2008a; Rich and Wallis, 2017).

The movie had a mixture of novel and anticipated new events. (B) We chunked the movie

saliency as defined as the proportion of an independent group of participants (n = 80) that
determined event-boundaries in the movie-epochs. (C) Event saliency was used to
construct the hierarchical relationship of epochs, with distance being the sum of event
saliency between epochs. The heat map shows the sum of saliency of the events that

Approval
The study protocol was approved by the Office for the Protection of Human Subjects of
the University of California, Berkeley and the University of California, Irvine. All
participants provided written informed consent before participating.
Participants
Intracranial EEG: Ten epileptic patients who had stereo-tactically implanted depth
electrodes to localize the seizure onset zone for subsequent surgical resection
participated in this study, (4 female, mean age = 37, SD = 11, age range = 22 to 58 years
old; Table 1). The electrodes were placed at the University of California, Irvine Medical
Centre with 5-mm inter-electrode spacing. All patients had normal (or corrected) vision.
No seizure occurred during task administration. Two independent neurologists inspected
the neural activity and identified the electrodes with an epileptic activity which were
excluded from the analysis so that all electrodes included in analysis were

nonpathological and free of epileptogenic spikes. Any segment where focal spikes spread
to other brain regions were also excluded from analysis (Table 1). Electrode coverage
included the medial temporal lobe and the prefrontal cortex depending on their clinical
requirements (Figure 2). Electrodes were localized in the patient’s native space, then
transferred to MNI space for visualizing the group coverage. We studied electrodes in
three regions of interests: the lateral PFC, the OFC, and the hippocampus (Table 1 and

Behavioral experiment: A control group of 80 healthy adults participated in a movie
segmentation test (53 female, mean age = 28, SD = 14, age range = 18 to 68 years old).
31 participants were 18 to 21 years old, 29 participants were 21 to 30 years old, and 20
participants were older than 30 years old.
Experimental design
Salient events can occur frequently in a flow of events, such as serving customers in a
busy café, or they can be infrequent, such as driving along a desert highway. Participants
watched a short mute animation (~3minutes long) that had frequent salient events. The
movie was a short version of the animation designed by Ali Derakhshi, named "wildlife"
or "Hayat-e Vahsh," the episode on lions . The movie was selected so that participants
have not watched it before, the visual angle was kept similar (Figure 1A), and events with
various magnitudes of saliency occurred in a short period. Critically, the storyline of the
movie changed so we could test the effect of novel versus anticipated salient events (link
to the movie: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_guH9vA0sk).
The movie had an overarching cliché love triangle story. It starts by showing a few animal
couples going back and forth in a park (this part gets repetitive after 2 repetitions). Then,
there is a small lion that looks heartbroken. The lion sees a lioness, but there is a bigger
lion that also wants to meet the lioness. The two lions fight for the lioness’s attention
through a series of matches. After each match, the scored is shown on board (this part is
repetitive and predictable). However, the score is not immediately shown after an eating
contest. After the bigger lion wins the eating contest, it eats the small lion’s food too. Then
the score is shown, and the matches continue. The small lion loses the competition and

moves on. The end of the movie shows that the small lion meets a lioness again (this part
was repetitive). This movie had periods with an anticipated flow. For example, after each
game that the bigger lion wins, the scoreboard is shown.
The iEEG group passively watched the muted movie, but the behavioral control group
watched the muted movie and concurrently segmented the movies into episodes. We
instructed the behavioral group to press a key "whenever something new happened." We
clarified that "we want to segment this movie into episodes." After the segmentation task,
they performed a target detection task with targets displayed at random intervals.
Participants were instructed to press a key as soon as they perceived the target. This part
of the experiment measured participants’ response time for normalization the timing of
event-boundaries across subjects.
Behavioral analysis
We recorded the timing of keypresses during segmentation and target detection tasks.
Participants’ response time during the target detection task was measured as the
difference between the target onsets and the responses. We excluded consecutive
keypresses for segmentation if the interval was less than 100ms (double key registration).
The averaged response time per participant was subtracted from the timing of keypresses
for movie segmentation to normalize the timing of event-boundaries. The number of
segmented events was accumulated across participants at 1.5-second epochs. The
number of events in the 1.5-second epochs reflected the saliency of events (see also
Ben-Yakov and Henson, 2018). Accordingly, an event was more salient if more people
reported it as an event-boundary, and an event was considered less salient if fewer

people marked them as an event-boundary (See Figure 1B for the range of saliency
scale). The autocorrelation analysis of the event saliency was tested using the Ljung–Box
test that was implemented in R (R Development Core Team, 2014). There was no
significant autocorrelation in the saliency magnitude in 1.5 second epochs (chi-squared
= 1.922, df = 1, P = 0.1656). Likewise, autocorrelation in the epochs of 1.5-second highfrequency activities was negligible, allowing to use permutation test and apply the event
saliency magnitude for statistical analysis as outlined below.
A hierarchical clustering of event relationships (Figure 1) was constructed by applying a
binary hierarchical clustering algorithm in R (R Development Core Team, 2014) using
distances between events. The distance between two events was measured by adding
the saliency magnitude of all the events between the two events. Accordingly, the events
that had many highly salient events in between them had larger distance than the events
with less salient events between them.
iEEG data collection and preprocessing
Intracranial EEG data were acquired using the Nihon Kohden recording system, analogfiltered above 0.01 Hz and digitally sampled at 5 KHz or 10 KHz. A photodiode recorded
the luminance of a corner of the screen to track the timing of the movie presentation. Two
independent neurologists selected the electrodes that showed both epileptic activities and
epochs with seizure spread. Only electrodes in non-pathological regions were included in
the analysis.
All EEG analyses were run in R, Matlab 2015a, and fieldtrip toolbox (Oostenveld et al.,
2010) offline. We applied a 2 Hz stopband Butterworth notch filter at 60 Hz line power

noise and harmonics and then down-sampled the data to 1 KHz using resample() Matlab
function via fieldtrip. The function applies an antialiasing FIR lowpass filter and
compensates for the delay introduced by the filter. All electrodes were re-referenced to a
neighboring electrode (i.e., bipolar reference). The continuous signal was then cropped
in 1.5-second-long epochs with no overlaps. The epochs were bandpass filtered for highfrequency activity (HFA; 50 to 150 Hz) using padding and a Hamming window. The Hilbert
transformation was applied to the filtered data for extracting the power.
Correlation analysis between the HFA and event saliency
The correlation between event saliency and the HFA in each electrode was calculated
using the Spearman correlation. For estimating the p-value, we used a non-parametric
statistical permutation test because the non-overlapping 1.5-second epochs of HFA were
interchangeable. Note that the magnitude of saliency and HFA epochs were not
significantly autocorrelated. The null distribution was made from 1000 iterations of
surrogated trial labels. In each iteration, the maximum correlation between the HFA and
saliency magnitude was taken across all electrodes in a region of interest (namely, the
lateral PFC, OFC, and the hippocampus) for each participant. The proportion of HFAsaliency magnitude correlation-coefficients in the null-distribution that was more than the
observed correlation-coefficient yielded the non-parametric corrected p-value for the
observed correlation. A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant.
Effects of anticipating salient events
We tested if the HFA-saliency magnitude correlation changed with anticipating salient
events using a linear mixed-effect model. We recalculated the correlations between HFA

and saliency magnitudes in each brain region in sliding windows of 15 seconds with
overlaps of 7.5 seconds (24 bins). We used a linear mixed-effect model to test the effect
of novel (n = 13) or anticipated periods of salient events (n = 11; rep = 0 for novel and 1
for repetitive storylines; Figure 4) from the three regions of interest (the correlation
coefficients (R) in each electrode region; the hippocampus, OFC, and dorsolateral PFC).
We used the linear mixed-effects model in MATLAB (fitlme) to account for the different
number of electrodes in each ROI of a subject and the nested effect of time (formulated
as R ~ rep + (rep | subject : electrodes) + (1|rep: time_bin)). ANOVA was applied for the
result of F-tests for the fixed-effect term in the linear mixed-effects model.
Electrode localization and visualization
Electrode locations were reconstructed and visualized in MATLAB using the Fieldtrip
toolbox (Stolk et al., 2018). We manually selected electrodes on the post-implantation
CT, which was co-registered to the pre-implantation MRI using SPM (Ashburner and
Friston, 1997), to maximize the accuracy of the reconstructions. A neurologist identified
the electrodes’ locations. We then normalized each patient's pre-implantation MRI to the
MNI152 template brain using SPM to obtained the electrode positions in MNI space
(Ashburner and Friston, 1999). If electrode locations in MNI space did not correspond to
electrode locations in native (subject) space after normalization (e.g., an electrode is
within hippocampus in native space, but appears outside the hippocampus in MNI space
after normalization), then electrode locations were manually adjusted to represent their
true locations in native space. Electrode locations for bipolar re-referenced channels were
calculated as the mid-point between the two electrodes (Burke et al., 2013, 2014; Long
et al., 2014). Representations of the cerebral cortex were generated using FreeSurfer

(Dale et al., 1999) and representations of the hippocampus were generated from the
Desikan-Killiany atlas (Desikan et al., 2006) using Fieldtrip. Brodmann areas were
inferred from Bioimage Suite package (http://bioimagesuite.yale.edu/).
Results
We identified the magnitude of salient events in the movie by studying a separate group
of adults (n = 80). This group indicated when during the movie a new episode started (i.e.,
perceiving an event-boundary). The metric of event saliency magnitude was the
proportion of identified event-boundaries in a short time-window of the movie (about 20
frames or 1.5 seconds; Figure 1B; total movie time was 3 minutes). Epochs of 1.5 sec
resulted in saliency magnitude of 0 to 0.6 (1 would be the maximum saliency magnitude
when every participant agrees that during the same 1.5 seconds an event-boundary
occurred). A distance matrix was constructed from the sum of the saliency of events that
occurred between pairs of events and was used for binary hierarchical event clustering
(see the methods; Figure 1). We tested the hypothesis that the magnitude of event
saliency was tracked in the targeted regions. Ranked (Spearman) correlation and nonparametric permutation tests for statistical results were applied. The interchangeable nonoverlapping HFA in 1.5-second epochs allowed using non-parametric permutation
testing. Cluster-corrected p-values are reported.
We observed that HFA correlated with the magnitude of event saliency that was captured
by the behavior of the independent rating group. The neural effect was clustered in
dorsolateral PFC (BA 6, 8, 9, and 10; in 5 out of 7 patients; 7 out of 9 patients with lateral
PFC electrodes had dorsolateral PFC coverage). The effect was also detected in the

We conducted a planned analysis on the electrodes that showed a significant correlation
(i.e., task-relevant) to assess the effects of anticipation (Table 2). We re-calculated the
correlation coefficient between the HFA and event saliency magnitude in 15 seconds long

sliding windows (7.5 seconds overlaps) resulting in 24 tested windows, out of which 11
had repetitive storylines, and 13 were novel. The flow of salient events in 46% of the
sliding windows was anticipated. A storyline was predictable if the same type of event
reoccurred more than twice, such as repetition of animals going back and forth or
repetition of scoring in a competition. The results of a linear mixed effect model showed
that the correlation coefficient between HFA and the saliency magnitude was higher in
the OFC when the salient events were anticipated than when they were novel (Figure 4A;
OFC F(1,142) = 4.3, P = 0.039), and this effect was observed in all patients with taskrelevant electrodes (Figure 4B). There was no difference between novel and anticipated
salient events in the hippocampus (F(1, 166) = 0.39, P = 0.52) or the dorsolateral PFC
(F(1, 526) = 1.26, P = 0.26).

Discussion
During encoding, a sequence of events is segmented to construct a hierarchical
representation of event associations (Kurby and Zacks, 2008; Zacks and Swallow, 2007;
Zwaan and Radvansky, 1998) with clusters of associated events represented in lower
levels of a hierarchy and the associations of the clusters of events represented in higher
levels of the hierarchy. The construction of such a hierarchical association requires linking
relevant events and separating events that occur in different circumstances. For instance,
a circumstance changes with perceiving a deviant event. Detecting the magnitude of
event saliency can also contribute to establishing the structure of associations. When the
newly perceived event is not salient, the event is closely associated with the preceding
events; however, if the new event is highly salient, it should be separated from the
preceding events. Here, we report distributed neural regions that detect the magnitude
of deviance (i.e., event saliency) in a flow of events including dorsolateral PFC and
hippocampus and further show that anticipating the deviant events affects the OFC
activities.

We used event segmentations of a large control population (behavior group) who watched
the silent movie, to infer the event segmentation in another group with intracranial
electrodes (iEEG group) who watched the same movie. The behavior group’s event
segmentation provided the event saliency of the entire movie. The reaction time of each
subject in this group was estimated from a target detection task and used for normalizing
the timing of event-boundaries (see the methods). We inferred the saliency from the
proportion of people that reported an event-boundary in each movie epochs. The 1.5
seconds windows provided interchangeable epochs of data for using correlation and
permutation tests (see the methods).
The iEEG group passively watched a movie and did not know about the segmentation
task, allowing us to study spontaneous and naturalistic neural processing during parsing
a continues flow of events. We observed that the HFA, that is linked to nearby SUA activity
(Belitski et al., 2008; Jacobs and Kahana, 2009; Lachaux et al., 2012; Ray et al., 2008a;
Rich and Wallis, 2017) increased proportionally with event saliency in hippocampus,
dorsolateral FPC, and medial orbitofrontal cortex.
HFA in the dorsolateral PFC in the iEEG group tracked event saliency magnitude.
Dorsolateral PFC is critical for guiding attention (Corbetta and Shulman, 2002; Hopfinger
et al., 2000; Kastner et al., 1999; Paus, 1996) and increased HFA may in part be due to
attention to novel events (Ray et al., 2008b; Zacks et al., 2001). Dorsolateral PFC is also
engaged in cognitive control and conflict monitoring (MacDonald et al., 2000; Miller and
Cohen, 2001) by detecting new associations of categories and exemplars (Dolan and
Fletcher, 1997). Accordingly, the observed additional correlation between HFA and event

saliency in dorsolateral PFC reflects the demand for event segmentation and updating
the event circumstance (Reynolds et al., 2007; Zacks et al., 2007).
Event saliency also correlated with HFA in the hippocampus. Hippocampal activity has
been linked to the representation of event associations (Ekstrom et al., 2003; Mack et al.,
2017; Quiroga, 2012; Quiroga et al., 2005). The hippocampal representation changes
with salient changes in the environment (Shapiro et al., 1997), and its activity increases
with detecting salient events (Axmacher et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2013, 2015; Knight,
1996; Kumaran and Maguire, 2007; Lisman and Otmakhova, 2001; Wittmann et al.,
2007). Recent studies showed that hippocampal representations reflect the scale of
topological saliencies of an environment, such as changes in the spatial closeness of
streets or the centrality of the streets (Javadi et al., 2017), and the scale of deviance from
expectation (Chen et al., 2015). Also, the hippocampal BOLD signal tracked the saliency
of event-boundaries when people watched movies (Ben-Yakov and Henson, 2018). Here,
we propose that small deviance induces only a minor change in the hippocampal
representation so that close events share more similar hippocampus representations than
far events (Ezzyat and Davachi, 2014). These result expand the pattern separation
mechanism for distinguishing similar visual associations attributed to the hippocampus
(Yassa and Stark, 2011), to a mechanism for identifying the scale of event separation.
Pattern separation for visual stimuli engages dentate gyrus in the hippocampus (Baker et
al., 2016; Berron et al., 2016) but what subregion of the human hippocampus contributes
to the deviant detection is unknown (see Lisman and Grace, 2005 for the novelty signal
in the rodent’s subiculum, and Knierim and Neunuebel, 2016 for mismatch signal in
subregions of rodent’s hippocampus).

We also observed a similar saliency magnitude effect in the medial OFC (BA 11 but not
in the lateral OFC), with increased HFA for highly salient events. This observation is akin
to the representation of saliency in the non-human primates’ OFC, captured by HFA (Rich
and Wallis, 2016, 2017). In humans, breaching expectations increases the OFC activity
(Duarte et al., 2009; Mikutta et al., 2015; Nobre et al., 1999). OFC also represents the
saliency of anticipated events (Bechara et al., 1996; Metereau and Dreher, 2015). The
reflection of the saliency magnitude suggests that OFC represents the structure of the
event association. Notably, anticipation is a critical feature for encoding sequences of
events because the gist of previous experience shapes the expected context (Purcell,
1986; Reynolds et al., 2007). Here, the HFA in medial OFC tracked the event saliency
better when the salient events were anticipated than during a novel intrusion of events
suggesting that the anticipated structure of event associations is represented in the
medial OFC.
An important question concerns the dynamics of interaction in the neural network for
representing the structure of event associations. For example, disturbing the input from
the hippocampus to OFC impairs representing task structures in rodents (Wikenheiser et
al., 2017). It is not clear if hippocampal deviancy detection is essential for constructing
the OFC signal in humans or if other brain regions such as mid-brain structures contribute
to detecting the magnitude of deviance (Dürschmid et al., 2016; Wittmann et al., 2007).
For instance, hippocampal response to deviant events is associated with activity in the
substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area (Murty and Adcock, 2014; Wittmann et al.,
2007). It is also suggested that the hippocampus provides a novelty signal to the nucleus
accumbens (Dürschmid et al., 2016). While hippocampus activity is linked to anticipation

(Hsieh et al., 2014; Hindy et al., 2016; Jafarpour et al., 2017), an outstanding question is
whether the prediction is made by the hippocampus or is under control of other brain
regions such as the PFC. Systematically comparison of regional activity, however,
requires simultaneous recordings from both regions in a patient. A caveat of this iEEG
study is that all the patients did not have sufficient coverage from multiple task-relevant
regions to definitively study the dynamics of the network.
Event segmentation requires tracing the association of a new event to the preceding
events (Zwaan and Radvansky, 1998). Detecting a new event’s deviance magnitude
helps with an accurate association of the event to the preceding sequence. Accordingly,
segmented sequences that are separated by small surprises are more associated in
comparison to a sequence separated by a big surprise. Detecting deviant events is known
to increase neural activity in the PFC and the hippocampus (Axmacher et al., 2010;
Bunzeck et al., 2010; Knight, 1996; Kumaran and Maguire, 2007; Long et al., 2016;
Strange et al., 2005). Both brain regions, albeit differently, represent the associations in
an experimental setup (O’Keefe and Nadel, 1978; Tolman, 1948; Wikenheiser and
Schoenbaum, 2016; Wilson et al., 2014). Here, we showed that the hippocampus and
PFC regions tracked the scale of event saliency in a movie, and in the medial OFC this
effect is stronger when the salient events were anticipated than for novel events. We
propose that a core function of the hippocampus, dorsolateral PFC, and medial orbital
PFC network is to construct the event association structure, akin to a task structure
(Wikenheiser and Schoenbaum, 2016; Wilson et al., 2014).
