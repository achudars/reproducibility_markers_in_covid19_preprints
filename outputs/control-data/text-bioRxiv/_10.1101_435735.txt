Abstract:

7

The processing of motion changes throughout the visual hierarchy, from spatially restricted ‘local

8

motion’ in early visual cortex to more complex large-field ‘global motion’ at later stages. Here we

9

used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine spatially selective responses in

10

these areas related to the processing of random-dot stimuli defined by differences in motion. We

11

used population receptive field (pRF) analyses to map retinotopic cortex using bar stimuli

12

comprising coherently moving dots. In the first experiment, we used three separate background

13

conditions: no background dots (dot-defined bar-only), dots moving coherently in the opposite

14

direction to the bar (kinetic boundary) and dots moving incoherently in random directions (global

15

motion). Clear retinotopic maps were obtained for the bar-only and kinetic-boundary conditions

16

across visual areas V1-V3 and in higher dorsal areas. For the global-motion condition, retinotopic

17

maps were much weaker in early areas and became clear only in higher areas, consistent with the

18

emergence of global-motion processing throughout the visual hierarchy. However, in a second

19

experiment we demonstrate that this pattern is not specific to motion-defined stimuli, with very

20

similar results for a transparent-motion stimulus and a bar defined by a static low-level property

21

(dot size) that should have driven responses particularly in V1. We further exclude explanations

22

based on stimulus visibility by demonstrating that the observed differences in pRF properties do

23

not follow the ability of observers to localise or attend to these bar elements. Rather, our findings

24

indicate that dorsal extrastriate retinotopic maps may primarily be determined by the visibility of

25

the neural responses to the bar relative to the background response (i.e. neural signal-to-noise

26

ratios) and suggests that claims about stimulus selectivity from pRF experiments must be

27

interpreted with caution.

1. Introduction

37

Motion perception is one of the fundamental dimensions of vision (Nakayama, 1985; Nishida, 2011),

38

and it is now known that many areas of the brain are involved in motion processing (Dupont et al.,

39

1994; Pitzalis et al., 2010; Sunaert et al., 1999; Tootell et al., 1997). Converging psychophysical,

40

electrophysiological, and imaging evidence suggests that motion is processed in an hierarchical

41

manner, with signals first being processed locally (within restricted spatial windows) in areas such as

42

V1 and then combined at higher levels in the visual cortical hierarchy to generate global motion

43

percepts over larger regions of the visual field (Adelson and Movshon, 1982; Braddick et al., 2001;

44

Van Essen and Gallant, 1994; Williams and Sekuler, 1984).

45

Many psychophysical studies have used tasks involving the detection or discrimination of coherent

46

motion to study the distinction between local- and global-motion processing (Britten et al., 1993,

47

1992; Newsome and Paré, 1988; Scase et al., 1996; Watamaniuk, 1993). Due to the aperture

48

problem, direction-selective neurons in lower visual areas such as V1 are thought to process only

49

local motion – the 1D motion orthogonal to the orientation of the edge that is passing through the

50

receptive field (Adelson and Movshon, 1982; Marr and Ullman, 1981; Movshon, 1986; Wallach,

51

1935). To be able to process global motion, these 1D signals must be integrated over a relatively

52

wide visual field area/region, a process thought to occur in higher visual areas, such as V5/MT+ to

53

generate a global motion direction (Heeger et al., 1996; Simoncelli and Heeger, 1998). fMRI

54

evidence has provided support for a distinction in the neural locations of local and global processing,

55

showing that V1 was activated more by incoherent local noise than coherent global motion, perhaps

56

because the noise stimulus led to the activation of neurons with a wider range of motion

57

selectivities. The reverse pattern was seen in V5 and V3A, which both responded more to coherent

58

motion compared to the noise stimulus (Braddick et al., 2001).

59

Other brain regions may be specialized for the detection of more complex motion patterns. One

60

example is that of kinetic boundaries, where an edge is defined by differences in coherent motion

61

direction on either side of the edge. A specific brain region known as the Kinetic Occipital area (KO),

62

which is thought to include areas such as V3, V3A and V3B (Larsson and Heeger, 2006), may be

63

specialized for detecting these boundaries (Van Oostende et al., 1997). However, other research

64

suggests that KO may not be completely specialized for motion-boundary processing, with KO

65

thought to also respond preferentially to stimuli such as form cues (Zeki et al., 2003). It has further

66

been shown that other visual areas such as LO1, LO2 and V7 respond preferentially to motion

67

boundaries, suggesting that motion-boundary processing may be more widely distributed across the

68

visual cortex (Larsson et al., 2010).

69

Despite this debate over the specificity of the area responding to kinetic contours, it is clear that

70

kinetic boundaries are relatively complex stimuli that are not processed at lower levels in the visual

71

hierarchy: they produce little fMRI response in lower visual areas such as V1 and V2 (Van Oostende

72

et al., 1997; Zeki et al., 2003), consistent with electrophysiological evidence that the majority of

73

neurons in these areas do not respond to kinetic contours (Leventhal et al., 1998; Marcar et al.,

74

2000).

75

The visual hierarchy also has multiple representations of the retina, laid out in topological maps that

76

are commonly called retinotopic maps (Felleman and Van Essen, 1991; Sereno et al., 1995). While it

77

was once thought that retinotopy was a property of lower level visual areas, it is now known that

78

areas such as MT+ and MST also contain retinotopic maps (known as TO1 and TO2 respectively;

79

(Amano et al., 2009), as do the frontal eye fields (Kastner et al., 2007) and even the default mode

80

network (Knapen et al., 2018). Indeed, despite the large receptive field sizes within primate MT/V5,

81

it is possible to track object position at the population level (Chen et al., 2015). This suggests that

82

retinotopy is a general organizing principle within the cortex. It is therefore of interest to know

83

whether retinotopic map properties vary according to the visual area under question, and

84

particularly whether these properties are affected by the different functional selectivities of

85

different regions of the brain.

86

One technique that has been used to analyse retinotopic maps via fMRI is population receptive field

87

(pRF) analysis, providing an estimation of both the visual field position preferred by each voxel and

88

the range of visual field locations where a stimulus evokes a response (Dumoulin and Wandell,

89

2008). pRFs can therefore be thought of as a statistical summary of the neuronal properties within a

90

sampled region. Recent work has shown systematic differences in pRF sizes across different brain

91

regions and eccentricities, with size increasing along the visual processing hierarchy and with

92

increasing eccentricity (Alvarez et al., 2015; Amano et al., 2009; Dumoulin and Wandell, 2008; Haas

93

et al., 2014; Harvey and Dumoulin, 2011; Schwarzkopf et al., 2014).

94

Across these different brain areas, several factors can affect pRF size and position. Retinotopy in

95

early visual areas is primarily thought to be stimulus-driven, but there is evidence that higher level

96

maps can also be attentionally-driven (Tootell et al., 1998). One study (Saygin and Sereno, 2008)

97

used point light biological walkers moving in a ‘wedge’ stimulus to dissociate attention and stimulus

98

effects in retinotopic mapping, and showed that V1 did not respond clearly when the distinction

99

between stimulus and background was driven only attentionally, but it did respond when there was

100

a visual difference between stimulus and background without attention directed to the stimulus. The

101

opposite pattern was seen in frontal and parietal areas. The spatial tuning of pRFs is also affected by

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/435735; this version posted May 2, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

102

attentional load at fixation, with pRF size increasing and pRF location becoming more eccentric

103

under high perceptual load (Haas et al., 2014). Similar results have also been reported in face-

104

selective brain regions (Kay et al., 2015). This position modulation seems to occur across the entire

105

visual field, not just at the attended location (Klein et al., 2014), and recent work suggests that these

106

position shifts are the key mechanism by which attention enhances discriminability and

107

representational quality of stimuli (Vo et al., 2017). It therefore seems that attention can affect

108

cortical spatial tuning properties, in turn altering the visibility of stimulus differences.

109

Stimulus properties may also alter the measured properties of pRFs. In particular, the fMRI response

110

of a voxel may be driven by different groups of cells depending upon the properties of the stimulus.

111

While most studies have used simple luminance-defined stimuli (such as checkerboards) to generate

112

pRF maps, more complex stimuli may be especially suited for generating maps in higher visual areas

113

(Yildirim et al., 2018). A recent study that used a pRF mapping stimulus designed specifically to

114

isolate orientation contrast showed reductions in measured pRF size in higher visual areas such as

115

LO compared to the measurements made with standard luminance-based stimuli (Yildirim et al.,

116

2018). pRF sizes have also been shown to vary based on the alignment and curvature of contours

117

within mapping stimuli (Dumoulin et al., 2014). In the motion domain, there is evidence that MT+

118

may be more susceptible to stimulus configuration than earlier visual areas (Alvarez et al., 2015) but

119

to date there has been no systematic investigation of the effects of different motion stimuli on pRF

120

measurement.

121

Given the above variations due to stimulus properties and attentional state, in this study we asked

122

whether stimuli thought to preferentially drive distinct stages of the motion-processing hierarchy

123

can similarly alter the estimation of pRF parameters. In our initial experiment, we tested this with a

124

moving bar stimulus similar to those commonly used in pRF mapping studies, defined by dots

125

moving coherently. We then used different backgrounds in an attempt to differentially drive

126

responses in different brain regions. In the bar-only condition, the bar was presented alone against a

127

grey background. We predicted that this stimulus would generate a strong visual signal and enable

128

the generation of pRF maps at all levels of the motion-processing hierarchy, much like a typical pRF

129

mapping stimulus. In the ‘kinetic’ condition the bar was defined by kinetic boundaries. We predicted

130

that if these stimuli are preferentially processed in KO/V3B, we might expect smaller pRF sizes and a

131

higher proportion of voxels responding in this area. Finally, in the ‘global’ condition, the background

132

consisted of incoherently moving dots. We therefore predicted that for the ‘global’ condition, higher

133

visual areas that process stimuli in a more global manner should be able to distinguish between the

134

bar and background and thus generate good pRF maps. In contrast, for these latter two conditions,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/435735; this version posted May 2, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

135

we predicted that V1 would not be able to distinguish the bar from the background, leading to a

136

reduced response.

137

In a second experiment, we asked whether any differential responses seen in the first experiment

138

were a consequence of differences in the selectivity of these motion-selective regions, or whether

139

they could be explained by other factors, such as the visibility of the stimulus. We compared a bar-

140

only stimulus to two conditions with lower visibility bars: one motion-defined stimulus, where the

141

bar was defined by transparent motion (against a non-transparent background), and a non-motion

142

defined stimulus, where the bar was instead defined by differences in dot size. If pRF properties

143

varied due to differential motion processing, we predicted that a different pattern of responses

144

should arise for these two stimuli: for example, the ‘transparent’ stimulus should show lower

145

responsivity than the ‘size defined’ stimulus in V1, but higher responsivity in higher visual areas

146

selective for global motion. In a similar vein, the subtle dot size difference in the size-defined

147

stimulus should maximize the signal in V1 and the early visual cortex compared to higher regions.

148

However, if the differential responses were simply due to the visibility of the bar stimulus, we

149

predicted similar responses for the two conditions across different visual areas. We also conducted a

150

third behavioural experiment as a control, presenting each of the above mapping stimuli and

151

requiring observers to localise the bar element. This allowed us to further assess whether variations

152

in the properties of pRFs could be predicted by the visibility of the bar stimuli, or whether these

153

variations can be attributed to the visibility of the neural signals underlying the BOLD response.

154

2. Experiment 1

155

Here we examined retinotopic maps and pRF properties across the visual hierarchy using three

156

distinct retinotopic mapping stimuli: the ‘bar-only’ stimulus, similar to standard retinotopic mapping

157

stimuli; the ‘global’ bar stimulus with coherent motion against a background of noise; and the

158

‘kinetic’ bar stimulus with coherent motion against a background of oppositely-moving dots.

2.1.1. Participants

161

Five participants (one male) took part in Experiment 1, including two of the authors (AH and JG) and

162

three experienced participants naïve to the aims of the study. Participants were aged between 24-36

163

years (mean = 29.6 years) and one participant was left handed. All participants were experienced in

164

an fMRI context and had normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity. Written consent was acquired

165

from all participants to ensure that they understood the potential risks associated with fMRI. The

166

experiments were approved by the UCL Research Ethics Committee.

180
181

Stimuli were created using MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA) and the Psychophysics toolbox

182

(Brainard, 1997; Pelli, 1997). Stimuli were projected onto a screen (resolution 1920 x 1080 pixels,

183

size 36.8 x 20.2cm) at the rear of the scanner bore, with the screen image reflected off a mirror

184

attached above the head coil. The viewing distance was 67cm, meaning the screen subtended 30.7 x

185

17.1 degrees of visual angle on the retina. The refresh rate was 60Hz.

186
187

The experimental stimulus consisted of a field of 2000 dots (diameter = 0.09°) against a uniform

188

median grey field. Half of the dots were randomly selected to be white, and the other half were

189

black. The initial positions of the dots were randomly determined within a rectangular aperture 16 x

190

16° in size. A mask was then applied to the image, such that only the dots within a circle with 8°

191

radius from the centre of the screen could be seen. A smaller circular mask (diameter = 0.8°) was

192

also applied at the fixation point (diameter = 0.17°) to hide dots in this area and thus aid participants

193

in maintaining their fixation. Further masks were also applied depending upon condition (see

194

below). To further aid fixation, a low contrast “radar screen” pattern was shown behind stimuli (12

195

radial lines spaced 30 polar degrees apart, extending from just outside the fixation dot to the edge of

196

the screen, (15.5°), along with 11 concentric rings centred on fixation increasing in radius in equal

197

steps of 3°).

198
199

A ‘bar’ was defined as a strip within the circular stimulus region that was 2.4° wide and up to 16° in

200

length (the total width of the hidden stimulus rectangle). This area was shifted over the course of

201

each trial in 25 discrete steps of 0.7° and 1 second each, beginning at one edge of the stimulus

202

aperture and ending on the opposite side. The bar could be rotated to start in any one of the four

203

cardinal directions or the four oblique directions, giving eight different trial types. In one run, all

204

eight different trial types were presented, along with two null trials where no bar was present. The

205

null trials were always presented as the 5th and 10th trials. The order of the other directions was fixed

206

for all participants and went anticlockwise from the first direction, which was where the bar was

207

horizontal, starting at the top of the screen and moving downwards.

208
209

There were three different stimulus conditions that could be presented in a given run to the

210

participants. In each condition, the dots within the bar always moved in the same way; what differed

211

between conditions was the movement of the background dots outside the bar area.

212
213

In the ‘bar-only’ condition, only the dots within the bar were visible, and therefore the bar appeared

214

to be moving across a grey background. In the ‘kinetic’ condition, the dots outside the bar (within

215

the circular stimulus region) were always moving in the opposite direction to the dots within the bar,

216

creating a ‘shearing’ effect which made the bar visible. In the ‘global’ condition, the dots outside the

217

bar moved in random directions, allowing the bar to be detected as a 100% coherent global-motion

218

stimulus against a background of noise in adjacent areas of the stimulus. While this condition

219

therefore also contained kinetic boundaries, they were far less clear than the opposing directions

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/435735; this version posted May 2, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

220

used in the ‘kinetic’ stimulus. When a dot moved into the bar area (either through its normal

221

progression or through a shift of the bar region), it started to move in the same coherent direction

222

as all other bar dots. Similarly, when a dot left the bar area, it began to move randomly again. In all

223

conditions, the null trials (with no bar present) had the same background motion as during the bar

224

trials; a blank screen for the ‘bar-only’ condition, coherent motion in the ‘kinetic’ condition and

225

random motion in the ‘global’ condition.

226
227

In all conditions, dots within the bar all moved in the same direction and moved along the length of

228

the bar (so if the bar was moving from the top to the bottom of the screen, the dots moved from left

229

to right or vice versa). All the dots (in both bar and background) changed direction by 180 degrees

230

every 0.5 seconds, to prevent adaptation to one motion direction. Dots moved at 0.8°/second in all

231

conditions. If any dots moved outside the aperture during the experiment, they were moved back

232

one aperture width in the appropriate direction.

233
234

Each trial took 25 seconds, meaning that a run took 4 minutes and 10 seconds (plus a short period at

235

the beginning of the run that was used to ensure that the fMRI signal had reached equilibrium). Each

236

participant completed 4 runs for each condition, giving a total of 12 runs in the entire experiment.

237

The order of the different conditions varied for different participants to control for order effects.

238
239

2.1.3. Fixation task

240

Participants were instructed to focus on a blue fixation dot (diameter = 0.17°) at all times and to

241

press a button on an MRI-compatible button box when they saw it change colour (to a red-purple).

242

The probability of the blue dot changing colour was 0.01 every 200ms and the colour change periods

243

lasted 200ms each. The results of this attentional task were unrecorded, and simply served to keep

244

the participant fixated and alert throughout the experiment. An eye tracker (Eyelink 1000, sampling

245

at the screen refresh rate of 60Hz) was used to monitor eye movements and ensure that participants

246

were fixating correctly. We determined gaze stability using the methods outlined in (Haas and

247

Schwarzkopf, 2018); briefly, this involves calculating the median absolute deviation of the sampled

248

gaze positions along both the horizontal and vertical dimensions for each run, and using these

249

measures to compare the stability of gaze across conditions. Any run where fewer than 10 valid

250

samples were taken was removed from further analysis. One participant was not eye tracked during

251

either experiment, and therefore eye tracking data reflects the average of four participants in both

252

Experiments 1 and 2. Analysis of the difference in eye position between conditions (both in the x and

253

y directions) used general linear mixed models (using condition as a fixed factor, and subject and

repeat number as random factors) followed by posthoc pairwise comparisons, with packages lme4

255

(Bates et al., 2014) and emmeans (Russell, 2018) in R (version 3.5.0).

256
257

2.1.4. Data acquisition

258

Scans were acquired using a Siemens Avanto 1.5T MRI scanner with a 32-channel Siemens head coil

259

located at the Birkbeck-UCL Centre for Neuroimaging. We used a modified version of the head coil

260

without the eye visor to allow an unrestricted view of the screen, leaving 30 effective channels. We

261

used functional T2*-weighted multiband 2D echo planar imaging with a multiband sequence (Breuer

262

et al., 2005) and the following properties: voxel size = 2.3mm isotropic, field of view = 96 x 96, 36

263

slices, repetition time (TR) = 1s, echo time (TE) = 55ms, flip angle = 75˚, and acceleration factor = 4.

264

We collected 260-262 volumes (depending on stimulus condition) per run, and 4 runs were collected

265

per condition for each participant. We also acquired a T1-weighted anatomical magnetisation-

266

prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo (MPRAGE) scan for each participant (TR = 2730ms, TE

267

= 3.57ms) with a resolution of 1mm isotropic voxels.

268
269

2.1.5. Analysis

270

The method used for analysing pRFs has been described previously (Alvarez et al., 2015; Dumoulin

271

and Wandell, 2008; Moutsiana et al., 2016; Schwarzkopf et al., 2014; van Dijk et al., 2016). In brief,

(depending on stimulus condition) were removed to allow the signal to reach equilibrium, leaving

250 volumes to be used in analysis for all participants and conditions. We then carried out intensity

the time series from each vertex in each run, and runs of the same stimulus condition were z-

289

290
291

Population receptive field analysis was carried out on the occipital lobe data in a two-stage

292

procedure. With a binary aperture describing the position of the bar element within each stimulus

293

for each scanning volume (which was identical in each condition), we calculated its overlap with a

294

profile of a pRF to predict the fMRI time series in the experiment. We first carried out a coarse grid

295

search fit on data smoothed with a large kernel on the spherical surface (full width half maximum =

296

5), allowing calculation of the three pRF parameters that gave the maximal Pearson’s correlation

297

between the predicted and observed time series for the full set of search grid parameters and

298

vertices. These parameters were then used to seed an optimisation algorithm (Lagarias et al., 1998;

299

Nelder and Mead, 1965) in a slow fine fit procedure on a vertex by vertex basis using unsmoothed

300

data, allowing refinement of the parameter estimates and the calculation of an estimate of response

301

strength.

303

Visual areas V1, V2 (dorsal and ventral), V3 (dorsal and ventral), V3A, V3B and MT+ (defined as TO1

304

and TO2; see supplementary materials for an example) were delineated based on reversals in the

305

polar angle map from the ‘bar-only’ stimulus condition (Sereno et al., 1995). For participants who

306

only completed Experiment 2, the ‘transparent bar-only’ condition was used instead. These regions

307

can be seen in Figure 2 and Figure 7. Throughout our main analyses, we used an R2 (goodness-of-fit)

308

threshold of 0.05, which corresponds in our dataset to a p-value of 0.000367 (due to the number of

309

observations per dataset and the number of free parameters in the pRF model). As our experimental

310

conditions often show relatively weak and sparse responses, we chose this relatively liberal

311

threshold to enable us to analyse the residual responses. However, we also carried out all analyses

312

using a more conservative R2 value of 0.1, and results from these analyses can be seen in the

313

supplementary material.

316

Figure 2 shows the left hemisphere polar angle maps for each experimental condition and each

317

participant in Experiment 1 (R2 threshold = 0.05). Visual inspection of these images suggests that the

318

‘bar-only’ condition (Figure 2A) produces the clearest polar angle maps across participants, while the

319

‘kinetic’ condition (Figure 2B) tends to show a similar, if weaker pattern. The ‘global’ stimulus (Figure

320

2C) shows a weaker response still, with lower visual areas (e.g. V1) showing very little response.

Although we had a relatively small number of participants, these general trends are highly

Figure 3. Correlation matrices comparing pRF polar angles between stimulus conditions in Experiment 1. The
colour of each cell indicates the strength and sign of each vertex-wide correlation in polar angle. Circular
correlations were calculated for each participant, then Z transformed and averaged across participants (as in
(Haas and Schwarzkopf, 2018)). The symbols indicate whether the average correlation in individual cells is
significantly different from zero (uncorrected). One star = p < 0.05. Two stars = p < 0.001.

338

In order to quantify the consistency of these maps, we determined the correlation between the

339

values for polar angle obtained for each vertex with each stimulus. As shown in Figure 3, the

340

correlation between these polar angle estimates was overall clear, particularly for visual areas V2,

341

V3, V3A and V3B where the average correlation was significantly different from zero. The correlation

342

between conditions was less clear in V1 and MT+.

343

We next determined the proportion of vertices within each of these visual areas responding

344

retinotopically in the three experimental conditions (goodness of fit of the pRF model R2 > 0.05,

345

Figure 4A). The bar stimulus produced the biggest response in areas V1-V3, which then dropped off

346

for the higher visual areas (V3A, V3B and MT+). In contrast, responses to the kinetic stimulus

347

increased across areas V1-V3, levelling off at V3A-V3B and then dropping in MT+. Responses to the

348

global stimulus were even lower in the early visual areas, but again increased, reaching a peak at

349

V3A and V3B. There were therefore large differences in stimulus responsivity in V1-V3, but these

350

differences were much reduced in the higher visual areas. There was a significant interaction

351

between condition and visual area in the final model of the data (interaction: χ2 = 336.06, p < 0.001;

352

main effect of visual area: χ2 = 141.63, p < 0.001; main effect of condition: χ2 = 377.49, p < 0.001).

353

This interaction also helps to explain the lack of significant correlation in polar angle values between

354

conditions in area V1 (Figure 3) – although the bar stimulus produced clear polar angle estimates in a

355

large number of V1 voxels, this was far less so for the other two stimuli.

356

Comparing the goodness of fit across conditions (Figure 4B) showed a similar pattern, with initially

357

large differences in R2 between conditions in the early visual areas that again decreased in higher

358

regions. This interaction between condition and visual area was again significant (interaction: χ2 =

359

60.629, p < 0.001; main effect of visual area: χ2 = 62.747, p < 0.001; main effect of condition: χ2 =

360

242.912, p < 0.001). The area with the highest average R2 value also differed for each condition; the

361

peak was in V3 for the bar stimulus, V3A for the kinetic stimulus and V3B for the global stimulus.

362

Finally, we analysed pRF size across conditions and visual areas (Figure 4C). Mean pRF sizes were

363

smallest in the early visual areas, V1-V3, increasing in higher regions. pRFs were also relatively

364

similar in early visual areas for all three conditions, but clear differences emerged in V3A, V3B and

365

MT+. Here, pRFs were largest for the bar condition, smaller for the kinetic condition, and smaller

366

again for the global condition (though in all cases larger than the equivalent condition in earlier

367

regions). Again, there was a significant interaction between condition and visual area (interaction: χ2

368

= 47.879, p < 0.001; main effect of visual area: χ2 = 174.505, p < 0.001; main effect of condition: χ2 =

369

24.434, p < 0.001). Similar results were seen when pRF size was examined as a function of

370

eccentricity in the different brain areas and experimental conditions (see Supplementary Figure 2).

371

pRF size was found to increase as a function of eccentricity in all brain areas, with the lowest rate of

372

increase for the global condition.

2.2.2 Control analyses

384

As there were clear differences in the proportion of responsive voxels in the three conditions, it is

385

possible that the differences in pRF size between conditions were due to this reduction in the voxels

386

included in each analysis, rather than a specific change in pRF size within each voxel. To examine this

387

possibility, we analysed the data for the ‘bar-only’ condition using just the voxels that survived

388

thresholding for the kinetic and global conditions (see Figure 5). The pattern of results is similar to

389

Figure 4C – pRF sizes were again comparable in early visual areas for the three conditions, with clear

390

reductions in pRF size for the kinetic and global conditions in areas V3A, V3B and MT+. In this case

391

however, the reduction can be attributed to the differential selection of voxels responding to the

392

same stimulus. In other words, the observed pRF size differences in Figure 4C are likely due to

393

changes in the voxels that respond to these stimuli rather than active changes in pRF size across the

394

different conditions. Using a linear model to compare the kinetic and global vertex conditions from

395

the control analysis with the kinetic and global data in the original analysis showed no significant

396

difference between the two data sets (χ2 = 0.758, p = 0.384).

each condition.

403

It is also possible that differences between conditions could be attributed to differences in fixation

404

stability between conditions. In a second control analysis we therefore examined the median

405

absolute deviations of eye position, which on average were highly consistent and relatively low for

406

both horizontal and vertical eye movements, averaging less than 0.5 degrees of visual angle for

407

every condition (see Figure 6). General linear mixed models followed by posthoc pairwise

408

comparisons suggested that there were no significant differences in eye position between

409

conditions, either for the X or the Y direction (for X, bar-kinetic: t30.14 = 0.356, p = 0.933, bar-global:

410

t30.26 = 0.457, p = 0.892, kinetic-global: t30.35 = 0.101, p = 0.994. For Y, bar-kinetic: t30.35 = - 0.614, p =

0.814, bar-global: t30.14 = -0.503, p = 0.871, kinetic-global: t30.43 = 0.111, p = 0.993). Differences in

412

fixation are therefore unlikely to have produced the above differences in pRF properties.

2.2.3 Experiment 1 summary

419

Altogether, the three stimulus types (bar-only, kinetic, and global) produced clear differences in

420

responsivity, goodness-of-fit, and pRF size across the visual hierarchy. Our control analyses reveal

421

that these differences cannot be attributed to differences in gaze stability between the conditions

422

and that the observed differences in pRF size are unlikely to reflect stimulus-driven changes in pRF

423

size within each voxel. Rather, it seems likely that the observed differences in pRF size can be

424

attributed to responses from different sub-populations of voxels in the three different conditions.

425

We next turn our attention to the source of the differences in responsivity that appear to be driving

426

these differences in pRF size. In particular, it is possible that differences in the visibility or salience of

427

the bar between these conditions could drive the differences in responsivity. We explore this

428

possibility in Experiment 2.

429

3. Experiment 2

430

As outlined in the introduction, estimates of pRF size and visual field location have been found to

431

vary according to both the properties of the mapping stimulus and the attentional state of the

432

observer. Although it is tempting to attribute the differences observed in Experiment 1 to

433

differences in the effectiveness of these stimuli at driving the selectivity of various stages of the

434

motion-processing hierarchy, the visibility of the bar element in each of our stimuli also varied

435

between the three conditions. Most participants in Experiment 1 informally noted that the bar was

436

less clear in the global condition than in the kinetic or bar-only conditions. It is possible then that the

437

differences observed were driven by the visibility or salience of the bar, rather than any difference in

438

the underlying selectivity of the motion detectors in each brain region.

439

In Experiment 2 we sought to test this by comparing the bar-only stimulus with two new stimuli.

440

Firstly, we devised a second form of stimulus defined by global motion, a ‘transparent’ stimulus

441

where the bar contained two sets of dots moving in opposite directions to give the appearance of

442

two sheets moving transparently across each other (Snowden and Verstraten, 1999). The global

443

percept of these two directions requires an integration across space that is similar to that for a single

444

direction of global motion amongst noise (Edwards and Greenwood, 2005; Edwards and Nishida,

445

1999). Transparent motion is not perceived when dots with opposing directions are ‘locally

446

balanced’ within small regions of the visual field (Qian et al., 1994), perhaps due to an intermediate

447

process of ‘local-motion pooling’ prior to the global-motion stage (Edwards et al., 2012;

448

Vidnyánszky et al., 2002). Although the responses of V1 neurons cannot distinguish between

449

transparent and non-transparent stimuli, both fMRI (Muckli et al., 2002) and electrophysiological

450

studies (Qian and Andersen, 1994; Snowden et al., 1991) show a differential response within

451

MT/V5. Transparent-motion stimuli thus offer another stimulus with which we can assess whether

452

pRF parameters differ when stimuli preferentially drive higher levels of the motion-processing

453

hierarchy. We therefore constructed bar stimuli with two opposing directions of transparent motion

454

within the bar, presented against a background of locally-balanced dots that do not appear

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/435735; this version posted May 2, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

455

transparent. If the differences in pRF parameters found in Experiment 1 are due to differences in

456

motion selectivity, we would expect the transparent-motion bar stimulus to produce weaker

457

responses in lower visual areas and a reduction in pRF size in higher visual areas, as with the ‘global’

458

condition.

459

Our second comparison stimulus was intended to examine the role of stimulus visibility in these

460

effects. Transparent motion in particular has been found to be less visible in peripheral vision than in

461

the fovea (De Bruyn, 1997), which would likely create issues for the visibility of our transparent bar

462

stimuli as they traverse the visual field, just as it may have been an issue in Experiment 1. We

463

therefore compared these transparent stimuli with a stimulus bar that was not defined by

464

differences in motion, but rather by a subtle difference in stimulus dot size. This bar stimulus would

465

likely differentially drive the responses of early visual areas, given their potential role in the

466

perception of object size (Moutsiana et al., 2016; Murray et al., 2006; Pooresmaeili et al., 2013;

467

Sperandio et al., 2012), but should not differentially drive the responses of higher motion-selective

468

regions as effectively as the motion-defined bars used previously. The size difference in these stimuli

469

does however lead to a substantial reduction in the visibility of the bar stimulus relative to the bar-

470

only condition, particularly in peripheral vision. In particular, we selected a size difference that

471

produced a similar level of subjective visibility to the ‘transparent’ condition (examined during pilot

472

testing). Were this size-defined condition to produce similar responses to the motion-defined

473

condition, this would suggest that visibility or salience is a more likely explanation for the observed

474

differences than the stimulus selectivity of the underlying neural populations.

476

3.1.1. Participants

477

Five participants (two male) took part in Experiment 2, including all four authors and one non-author

478

participant from the first experiment (age range 28-39 years, mean age: 32.6 years). One participant

479

was left handed. All had normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity and provided written consent,

480

as in Experiment 1.

481

3.1.2. Stimuli

482

The second experiment was set up with the same apparatus and general stimulus properties as the

483

first. Here there were three conditions related to the mapping stimuli: ‘bar-only’, ’transparent’ and

484

‘size-defined’. The ’bar-only’ condition in this experiment was identical to the ‘bar-only’ condition in

485

Experiment 1, except that the dots were paired such that the two dots in each pair travelled in the

486

same direction. However, different pairs travelled in opposite directions to give the impression of

487

transparent motion with two ‘sheets’ of dots travelling over each other in opposite directions. As in

488

the ‘bar-only’ condition of Experiment 1, the null trials for this condition contained only the uniform

489

grey background. The speed of the dots was reduced in this condition to 0.34°/second to increase

490

the impression of transparency.

491
492

In the ‘transparent’ condition, the bar was identical to the bar in the ‘bar-only’ condition. In this case

493

however, the background also contained paired dots, with each dot in the pair moving in opposite

494

directions, leading to the perception of non-transparent motion (as with ‘locally paired’ dot stimuli

495

used previously; (Qian et al., 1994). To keep dots within these local regions and avoid them

496

unpairing over time, the motion of the dots periodically reversed. The timing of these reversals was

497

randomised across dot pairs, so that reversals did not occur for all of the dots at the same time, a

498

feature that enhances the percept of transparent sheets moving across one another (Kanai et al.,

499

2004) when dot trajectories are limited (though not when locally paired, as in the background). The

500

consistent pairing of dots between bar and background (differing only in their consistent vs opposing

501

directions) meant that bar and background did not differ in dot density, and that the only feature to

502

distinguish the bar was the percept of transparency against a background of non-transparent flicker.

503
504

The ‘size-defined’ condition contained a bar that was defined by a difference in dot size rather than

505

by motion type; the dots in the bar were 0.10° in diameter against a background of dots with 0.09°

506

diameter. All the dots in this condition moved in random directions, though with the same frequency

507

of direction reversal as in the other two conditions (i.e. dots oscillated back-and-forth along a

508

randomly selected axis). Null trials for this condition were the same as for the ‘global’ condition in

509

Experiment 1.

510
511

To minimize anticipation effects in this experiment, the starting orientation and direction of the

512

sequence (anticlockwise or clockwise shifts) was randomised for each condition and participant but

513

kept constant across the four runs. Note that this meant that the movement direction of the bar

514

always changed in a sequential fashion. All other presentation and analysis procedures were as in

515

Experiment 1.

As in Experiment 1, the bar-only stimulus produced clear and consistent polar maps across

participants (Figure 7A). However, the transparent and size-defined stimuli produced much weaker

and more variable maps (Figure 7B & C), particularly in lower visual areas (e.g. V1) where responses

521

were considerably reduced. Interestingly, participants who self-reported that they were frequently

522

unable to detect the transparency or size-defined bar stimuli (shown by red crosses in Figure 7) also

523

had virtually no discernable map structure for these conditions.

Figure 8. Correlation matrices comparing pRF polar angles between stimulus conditions in Experiment 2. The
colour of each cell indicates the strength and sign of each vertex-wide correlation in polar angle. Circular
correlations were calculated for each participant, then Z transformed and averaged across participants (as in
(Haas and Schwarzkopf, 2018)). The symbols indicate whether the average correlation in individual cells is
significantly different from zero (uncorrected). One star = p < 0.05. Two stars = p < 0.001. Note: one participant
did not have enough data for valid correlations in the size-defined condition in V3B and MT, and so their data
was not used for the average calculation).

541

Correlations between these polar angle estimates in the 3 conditions were in general slightly weaker

542

than in Experiment 1, but were still generally positive, with significant correlations overall only in

543

areas V2 and V3A. As in Experiment 1, we next determined the proportion of vertices responding

544

retinotopically in the different experimental conditions (see Figure 9A). Here, the bar-only condition

545

produced similar response levels to the equivalent condition in Experiment 1, with these levels again

546

decreasing in higher regions. In comparison, the transparent and size-defined conditions showed

547

greatly reduced responsivity in early visual areas, similar to the global condition in Experiment 1.

548

Responsivity in these conditions increased in later visual areas, though not quite to the level of the

549

bar-only stimulus (unlike the global condition). There was a significant interaction between condition

550

and visual area in the final model (interaction: χ2 = 52.330, p < 0.001; main effect of visual area: χ2 =

551

24.933, p < 0.001; main effect of condition: χ2 = 223.071, p < 0.001). This interaction is again likely to

552

explain the lack of significant correlations in polar angle values between conditions, here given the

553

clear drop in responsivity for the latter two stimulus types across the visual hierarchy.

554

Goodness of fit also matched the pattern observed in Experiment 1, with the bar-only stimulus

555

having much better goodness of fit compared to the transparent and size-defined stimuli. Goodness

556

of fit was also worst in V1 and MT for all conditions, with R2 values increasing for more intermediate

557

visual areas (Figure 9B). Modelling of the goodness of fit showed that there was no significant

558

interaction between condition and visual area, (χ2 = 16.505, p = 0.086). However, there were

559

significant main effects of visual area (χ2 = 30.060, p < 0.001) and condition (χ2 = 289.304, p < 0.001).

560

Finally, we considered differences in pRF size for the different conditions and visual areas (Figure

561

9C). Again, as in Experiment 1 there was a highly significant interaction between condition and visual

562

area (interaction: χ2 = 64.806, p < 0.001; main effect of visual area: χ2 =72.031, p < 0.001; main effect

563

of condition: χ2 = 21.572, p < 0.001). With the bar-only stimulus, pRF size increases dramatically

564

across visual areas, with values comparable to those of Experiment 1. Although pRF values for the

565

transparent and size-defined stimuli are comparable in early areas, the rate of increase is much

566

lower than in the bar-only condition, resulting in considerably smaller pRFs in the highest areas. In

567

MT these values were broadly comparable to the global condition of Experiment 1 for the size-

568

defined stimulus, though generally much smaller for the transparent stimulus. pRF size also

569

increased as a function of eccentricity in all different brain areas and experimental conditions,

570

particularly for the bar-only stimulus (see Supplementary Figure 3).

3.2.2 Control analyses

582

As in Experiment 1, a control analysis was run to examine whether the above differences in pRF size

583

between conditions were due to this reduction in the voxels included in each analysis. We again

584

analysed data for the bar-only condition using just the voxels that survived thresholding for the

585

transparent and size-defined conditions. This again produced a clear reduction in pRF size for these

586

two conditions in areas V3A, V3B and MT, suggesting that the observed differences in pRF size may

587

be predominantly explained by differences in the responsivity of voxels (Figure 10). This is supported

588

by statistical analysis suggesting that there is no significant difference between the transparent and

589

size-defined conditions in the control analysis and in the original experimental analysis (χ2 = 0.111, p

590

= 0.739).

zero (obtained if the vertices for the condition do not overlap with any bar activation) were removed before

598

As in Experiment 1, the results of Experiment 2 also do not seem to depend on eye movements, as

599

the median absolute deviations of eye position were on average highly consistent and relatively low

600

for both horizontal and vertical eye movements, with averages of less than 0.5 degrees of visual

601

angle for both conditions (see Figure 11). General linear mixed models followed by posthoc pairwise

602

comparisons suggested that there were no significant differences in eye position between the bar-

603

only and size-defined conditions, either for the X or the Y direction (for X, bar-transparent: t35.20 = -

604

0.055, p = 0.998, bar-size: t35.04 = -1.439, p = 0.332, transparent-size: t35.20 = -1.354, p = 0.375. For Y,

605

bar-transparent: t35.23 = 0.667, p = 0.784, bar-size: t35.05 = -1.513, p = 0.297, transparent-size: t35.23 = -

606

2.149, p = 0.094). As before, this suggests that participants were highly compliant with the fixation

607

instructions and that differences in fixation stability cannot account for our results.

4. Experiment 3

613

In Experiment 2, we found very similar responses across visual areas for the transparent and size-

614

defined stimuli, both of which differed from the bar-only stimulus. This indicates that the visibility or

615

salience of the bar element could be important in determining responsivity and associated pRF

616

properties. However, there are several possible aspects of visibility that could be involved. One is

617

perceptual visibility, whereby the bar element may be less detectable (or more difficult to attend to)

618

in some stimuli than others, particularly in peripheral vision. Another is neural ‘visibility’, where pRF

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/435735; this version posted May 2, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

619

analyses might be affected by the reduced signal-to-noise ratio in cases where there is a background

620

signal (e.g. from the noise dots in the ‘global’ stimulus) as well as the responses to the bar element.

621

To distinguish between these possibilities, we therefore carried out a control perceptual experiment,

622

quantitatively assessing the visibility of the stimulus types used in Experiments 1 and 2 at different

623

eccentricities, using psychophysical techniques. If perceptual visibility can explain the results found,

624

we would predict that the ability of participants to detect the stimuli should follow the same pattern

625

as the differences in responsiveness seen in Experiments 1 and 2. Specifically, bar stimuli should be

626

highly visible, with a slight reduction in visibility for the kinetic stimuli, and further reductions for the

627

global, transparent, and size-defined stimuli.

628

4.1. Materials and Methods

629

4.1.1. Participants

630

Eight participants (three male) took part in the perceptual experiment, including two authors (who

631

participated in both fMRI experiments), one non-author participant who took part in Experiment 1,

632

and five naive participants (age range 21 – 37 years, mean age: 25.9 years). All had normal or

633

corrected-to-normal visual acuity and provided written consent, as in previous experiments.

634

4.1.2. Stimuli and procedures

635

The experiment was carried out in a laboratory setting (i.e. not in the scanner), with stimuli

636

presented on a Display++ monitor (Cambridge Research Systems, UK) with a size of 71 x 39.5 cm, a

637

resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels, and a refresh rate of 120Hz. Viewing distance was 1m, with head

638

movements restricted through the use of a chin and forehead rest. Responses were made via

639

keypad. Stimulus parameters were set to subtend the same visual angle as in the fMRI set up.

640

On each trial, participants were presented with a single bar location of the stimuli used for the main

641

fMRI experiments, meaning that the bar was presented in one of 22 different locations on the screen

642

for 1 second (the middle three locations were excluded from this experiment to avoid ambiguity

643

regarding their location relative to fixation). The participant’s task was to determine whether the bar

644

was above, below, left or right of the fixation point, and press the corresponding button on a keypad

645

to indicate their choice.

646

Each participant judged the bar location in five different types of stimuli: the three conditions used

647

in Experiment 1 (bar only, kinetic and global) and the transparent and size-defined conditions from

648

Experiment 2. All parameters used for these conditions were unchanged from the fMRI experiments.

649

One block of the experiment used just one of the five stimulus types, with five repeats of all the

650

possible positions (22) presented in two orientations (horizontal and vertical), giving 220 trials per

651

block. The order of trials within a block was randomized. Each participant completed 10 blocks in

652

total (two blocks of each stimulus type) and the order of these blocks was pseudorandomized (each

653

stimulus type appeared once in the first five trials and once in the second five trials).

654

Testing was completed in two sessions of approximately 40-50 minutes each. At the beginning of the

655

first session, naïve subjects were given practice trials for all stimuli. This involved showing the stimuli

656

initially for 5s, and then running a practice block for each stimulus type where the bars were

657

presented only at the innermost bar locations. This was done to ensure that naïve participants had a

658

similar amount of experience with the stimuli as those who had participated in the fMRI

659

experiments.

perceptual experiment, across different eccentricities. All individual data points are represented, along with a linear
fit to the full data set for each condition.

665

For each condition, responses were collated by eccentricity (collapsed across both visual hemifield

666

and bar orientation) and scored as the proportion correct at each point. Figure 12 shows these

667

responses along with the best-fitting linear function for each condition, a comparison that shows

668

clear differences in visibility for the different stimulus conditions used in our experiments. Both the

669

bar and kinetic stimuli were highly visible at even the furthest eccentricities. In contrast, the global

670

stimulus was highly visible at central eccentricities, with a slight drop in visibility at 10-12 deg,

671

although the difference in the slope of the linear fit was not significantly different from the bar

672

condition (t = -1.473, p = 0.142). The size-defined stimulus was slightly harder to localise, even in

673

central vision, with a steeper decline in visibility with eccentricity that was significantly different

674

from that of the bar stimulus (t = -8.632, p < 0.001). The transparent-motion stimulus was even less

675

visible at central eccentricities (though performance was still well above chance), with a similarly

676

steep decline in visibility with increasing eccentricity that was again significantly different from the

677

bar stimulus (t = -7.857, p < 0.001). Detectability of the size-defined and transparent-motion stimuli

678

was more variable across participants (as indicated by the larger error bars), similar to the variation

679

in visibility reported in Experiment 2.

680

Overall however, the above pattern of visibility does not closely match the variations observed in the

681

properties of the pRFs measured with these stimuli. In particular, the global condition was similarly

682

visible to the kinetic and bar conditions but showed a very different pattern of pRF data in

683

Experiment 1. Conversely, the size-defined and transparent conditions showed clear reductions in

684

visibility relative to both the global condition and to each other, and yet the pRF properties

685

measured with these stimuli were both similar to those of the global condition. We conclude that

686

stimulus visibility is unlikely to account for these differences in pRF properties.

687

5. Discussion

688

In this study, we show that retinotopic mapping stimuli defined by motion produce clear and highly

689

consistent differences in the properties of population receptive fields (pRFs) measured across the

690

visual hierarchy, including responsivity, goodness of fit, and pRF size. As predicted, we show that a

691

bar mapping stimulus defined by moving dots (against a blank background) produces strong pRF

692

maps in early visual areas, with responsivity decreasing and pRF sizes increasing in areas higher in

693

the motion processing hierarchy. More complex motion stimuli, such as bars defined by kinetic and

694

global motion (against backgrounds of opposing motion or noise, respectively), produce a much

695

lower degree of responsivity in early visual areas, with a reduction in pRF sizes for higher visual

696

areas, and reductions in goodness of fit across the hierarchy as a whole. Control analyses further

697

suggest that the reduction in pRF size can be attributed to the reduction in the voxels included for

698

each stimulus, rather than changes in pRF size within voxels. Although it is tempting to attribute this

699

to differences in the potential for these visual areas to distinguish these higher-order stimuli, a

700

second experiment showed highly similar patterns of responsivity, goodness of fit, and pRF size

701

across visual areas for a stimulus defined by transparent motion (against a non-transparent

702

background) and a size-defined stimulus (with no differences in motion) that were reduced in

703

visibility. This suggests that the observed differences in pRF properties are not specific to mapping

704

stimuli defined by differences in stimulus motion.

705

As outlined in the introduction, evidence from a variety of experimental approaches suggests that

706

motion is processed hierarchically in the visual system, with local motion processed in early visual

707

areas, such as V1, and global motion processed in higher areas, such as MT+ (Adelson and Movshon,

708

1982; Braddick et al., 2001; Movshon, 1986; Van Essen and Gallant, 1994; Williams and Sekuler,

709

1984). These differences in selectivity predict differences in pRF size and responsivity between local

710

motion defined stimuli (such as our bar stimulus) and global motion defined stimuli (such as our

711

global stimulus) for these different areas. Our results indeed show these differences, sometimes

712

quite strikingly; the lack of response in V1 for the global stimulus is highly consistent across

713

observers. Support for differences derived from other forms of motion selectivity is less clear. In

714

particular, it has been suggested that kinetic boundary stimuli are processed preferentially in visual

715

area V3B (Van Oostende et al., 1997). However, our results show that responses were equally as

716

strong in V3A, with comparable pRF sizes and goodness-of-fit values that were, if anything, better

717

than V3B. Our results therefore suggest that although there were clear differences in the pRF

718

properties measured in early visual areas with these stimuli, amongst higher areas these kinetic

719

boundary stimuli produced widespread changes in pRF properties that are difficult to localize to any

720

one area, supporting the notion that motion boundaries may be processed in a wide number of

721

areas in the visual cortex (Larsson et al., 2010; Larsson and Heeger, 2006).

722

The fact that we see very similar response patterns for both our ‘transparent’ and ’size-defined’

723

conditions in Experiment 2 further suggests that we should be cautious about attributing our results

724

to differential motion processing in distinct visual areas and should instead consider alternative

725

explanations. One possibility is that the results could reflect a decrease in visibility because of the

726

presentation of these bar mapping stimuli in peripheral vision. Our sensitivity to global motion

727

(Raymond, 1994), transparent motion (De Bruyn, 1997), and kinetic boundaries or motion-defined

728

form (Regan and Beverley, 1984) are all known to decline in the periphery. These declines can be

729

corrected for by adjusting the contrast, size, and speed of stimuli (Hess and Aaen-Stockdale, 2008;

730

Regan and Hamstra, 1991), at least to some extent. However, were the lack of eccentricity scaling a

731

problem with our stimuli, we should have seen an increase in average pRF size with our motion-

732

defined stimuli due to the loss of responsivity from neurons with small receptive fields (as seen in

733

comparisons between size-invariant and eccentricity-scaled bar stimuli; (Alvarez et al., 2015). Our

734

psychophysical results in Experiment 3 also show that while there are decreases in visibility in

735

peripheral vision, these do not show a consistent relationship with our pRF data. For instance, while

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/435735; this version posted May 2, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

736

the global, transparent and size-defined conditions all showed reductions in pRF responsivity relative

737

to the bar-only stimulus, the bar element in the global condition was in fact clearly visible at all but

738

the most extreme eccentricities. Conversely, the size-defined bars were much harder to localise,

739

with further reductions for the transparent stimulus, and yet pRF responsivity rates for these two

740

conditions were similar. This suggests that perceptual visibility is not the main factor driving the

741

responses we observe.

742

Previous research has shown that differences in attention to peripheral stimuli can also influence

743

neural responses. One study found decreased responses in V1 (but stronger responses in parietal

744

and frontal areas) when participants distinguished between stimulus and background entirely

745

attentionally (Saygin and Sereno, 2008). It has also recently been shown that it is possible to map

746

retinotopic responses for bar stimuli defined by illusory contours, occluded parts of a bar, or very

747

low luminance contrast (Haas and Schwarzkopf, 2018), suggesting that the mapping reflected

748

spatial attention rather than specific visual properties of these stimuli. In the current experiment, it

749

is likely that the more complex second-order stimuli used were more attentionally demanding than

750

the ‘bar-only’ stimuli. Along these lines, second-order motion has been found to be more difficult to

751

process at multiple locations compared to first-order motion, suggesting that second-order motion is

752

more attentionally demanding (Lu et al., 2000). Direction discrimination thresholds for second-order

753

motion are also influenced more strongly by attention than thresholds for first-order motion (Allen

754

and Ledgeway, 2003). It may be then that the greater attentional demands required to detect

755

second-order stimuli (like our bars defined by differences in global motion) are more important for

756

determining the responsivity and properties than the stimulus parameters. Again, however, the

757

results of our psychophysical experiment argue against this – the global stimulus in particular was

758

highly visible across the visual field (suggesting that observers had no difficulty attending to these

759

bar elements) and yet pRF responses were similar to those for the transparent stimulus that was

760

much less visible (and which therefore may have presented difficulties for attention). In other words,

761

attention does not seem to offer a complete explanation for our results.

762

Another possibility is that our motion- and size-defined stimuli may have produced an illusory sense

763

of depth for the bar stimulus, which may then have altered our measured pRF properties. It is known

764

that areas such as V3B and V3A are involved in the processing of depth cues (Tyler et al., 2006), and

765

particularly with integration of depth cues with other signals, such as motion (Ban et al., 2012).

766

However, we think this is unlikely to be a complete explanation of our results, as participants did not

767

report strong depth percepts for any of our stimuli. In addition, it is not clear that this hypothesis

768

would explain the patterns observed in our results; we did not see markedly stronger responses in

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/435735; this version posted May 2, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

769

V3A/V3B, as has been observed in previous fMRI studies of depth perception (Anzai and DeAngelis,

770

2010; Backus et al., 2001; Tsao et al., 2003). A related suggestion is that the responses in higher

771

visual areas may be a consequence of surface segmentation cues; however, again, research has

772

shown that early visual areas such as V1 are also activated by texture detection and surface

773

segregation processes (Scholte et al., 2008).

774

Finally, rather than psychophysical visibility, it is likely that the visibility of the neural responses to

775

mapping stimuli (relative to background activity and noise levels) may be an issue in the

776

measurement of population receptive fields. pRF analyses rely on a difference in BOLD response

777

when the stimulus bar and the background are presented in a given location of the visual field

778

(though of course the BOLD response is an indirect measure of differences in neural processing that

779

may reflect vascular responses in some situations; (Logothetis, 2008; O’Herron et al., 2016).

780

Changes in the response to the background stimulus may therefore affect our ability to derive these

781

measures. In particular, although unidirectional global motion typically drives BOLD responses in MT

782

to a greater extent than incoherent noise (Braddick et al., 2001), incoherent noise stimuli still

783

produce an increased response within MT relative to stationary stimuli (McKeefry et al., 1997). The

784

same would be true for our kinetic boundary and transparent stimuli. It is possible therefore that the

785

luminance-defined differences produced by the bar-only stimulus produce a clearer difference

786

between bar and background responses than the motion-defined differences of the other

787

conditions, consistent with the observed reductions in goodness of fit for the pRF parameters

788

derived using these motion-based stimuli. This could also explain why size-defined stimuli produced

789

a similar pattern of results, given that the noise dots used in these stimuli would similarly decrease

790

the difference in BOLD response to the stimulus bar relative to the background. Larger pRF estimates

791

are likely to be particularly vulnerable to this issue, given that these voxels tend to show the worst

792

goodness-of-fit. For instance, in Experiment 1 there was a clear negative correlation between R2 and

793

pRF size in V1, even with the bar-only stimuli (ρ = -0.721, p < 0.001). Voxels with large pRF estimates

794

may thus be the first to drop out with our motion-based stimuli, leading to our observed reductions

795

in pRF size. Were this to be the case, our findings would in fact reflect the selectivity of visual brain

796

regions for motion (given the increased responsivity to the stimulus background), though the

797

reduction in pRFs could not be strictly interpreted as a property of the underlying neural

798

populations. Given that our behavioural data suggests that simple psychophysical visibility is not well

799

matched to our pRF results, we would argue that this explanation provides the most parsimonious

800

explanation of our results.

801

Previous work has suggested that when the stimulus bar is defined by orientation contrast,

802

reductions in pRF size in higher visual areas (such as LO1 and LO2) may be caused by the stimulus

803

mainly driving neurons sensitive to orientation contrast (Yildirim et al., 2018). Here, while we also

804

find reductions in pRF size for our more complex second-order conditions, the similarity in responses

805

between very different conditions (like the size-defined and transparent stimuli) leads us to argue

806

that this reduction can be more parsimoniously explained by reductions in the signal-to-noise ratio

807

of the neural signal, as discussed above. Of course, this does not mean that second-order stimuli are

808

not useful (for example, they may potentially improve the accuracy of pRF estimates by reducing

809

BOLD displacement; (Olman et al., 2007; Yildirim et al., 2018), and it does not mean that there may

810

not be stimulus-specific signals in pRF mapping; for example, recent studies have shown that varying

811

the orientation or direction of motion of the carrier stimulus within the bar apertures used for

812

mapping can lead to differences in pRF parameters (Dumoulin et al., 2014; Harvey and Dumoulin,

813

2016). We simply urge future researchers to be cautious when interpreting the functional meaning

814

of changes in pRF properties.

815

In conclusion, we find evidence for variations in the properties of retinotopic maps for different

816

motion-based stimuli. In particular, we find clear retinotopic maps for stimuli defined by a moving

817

bar of dots against a blank background, but much weaker maps when the bar was defined by

818

coherently moving dots against a background of either incoherent or oppositely-moving dots, or by

819

transparent compared to non-transparent motion. However, the similar maps derived from stimuli

820

defined by size differences suggest that these differences do not reflect a change in the responsivity

821

of neurons in different visual areas to different motion properties. We similarly rule out variations in

822

perceptual visibility or attentional selection of the bars with our behavioural data. Rather, we

823

suggest that it is the visibility of the neural signal for retinotopic mapping stimuli, as defined by the

824

signal-to-noise ratio between bar and background responses, that is the most important driver of

825

pRF properties.

Figure S1: An example delineation of areas TO1 and TO2 on the smoothed retinotopic maps for a single participant (using
data from the dot-only bars in Experiment 1, and a threshold of 0.06). The border between them was determined as being
an upper vertical meridian reversal (red), and the outer borders on either side were either a horizontal (blue) to lower
vertical meridian (green). For analyses however, we combine TO1 and TO2 into one MT+, so the exact distinction is not
relevant for analysis.

Analyses using an R2 threshold of 0.1

1083

As our experimental conditions often showed relatively weak and sparse responses, we used a fairly
liberal R2 threshold of 0.05 in the main analyses. Here, we show the same analyses using a more
conservative R2 threshold of 0.1. Overall, the results are highly comparable. We did not conduct
formal statistical analysis due to the relatively high levels of missing data in some conditions and for
some participants.

subject 5 is on the far right), and stimulus condition forms a row. Manual delineations of visual areas V1, V2,
V3, V3A, V3B and hMT+ (TO1/2) are shown. (a) Polar angle estimates for the ‘bar-only’ stimulus condition. (b)
