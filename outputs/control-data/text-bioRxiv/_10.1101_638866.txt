SUMMARY

58

59

Breast cancer (BC) is a heterogeneous disease where each OncoOmics approach needs to be

60

fully understood as a part of a complex network. Therefore, the main objective of this study was

61

to analyze genetic alterations, signaling pathways, protein-protein interaction networks, protein

62

expression, dependency maps and enrichment maps in 230 previously prioritized genes by the

63

Consensus Strategy, the Pan-Cancer Atlas, the Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase and the

64

Cancer Genome Interpreter, in order to reveal essential genes to accelerate the development of

65

precision medicine in BC. The OncoOmics essential genes were rationally filtered to 144, 48

66

(33%) of which were hallmarks of cancer and 20 (14%) were significant in at least three

67

OncoOmics approaches: RAC1, AKT1 CCND1, PIK3CA, ERBB2, CDH1, MAPK14, TP53,

68

MAPK1, SRC, RAC3, PLCG1, GRB2, MED1, TOP2A, GATA3, BCL2, CTNNB1, EGFR and

69

CDK2. According to the Open Targets Platform, there are 111 drugs that are currently being

70

analyzed in 3151 clinical trials in 39 genes. Lastly, there are more than 800 clinical annotations

71

associated with 94 genes in BC pharmacogenomics.

INTRODUCTION

86

87

Breast cancer (BC) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by an intricate interplay between

88

different biological aspects such as ethnicity, genomic alterations, gene expression deregulation,

89

hormone disruption, signaling pathway alterations and environmental determinants1,2. Over the

90

last years, prevention, treatment and survival strategies have evolved favorably; however, there

91

are BC profiles that remain incurable3. Nowadays, BC is the leading cause of cancer-related

92

death among women (626,679; 15% cases) and the most commonly diagnosed cancer

93

(2,088,849; 24% cases) worldwide4.

94

95

The development of large-scale DNA sequencing, gene expression, proteomics, large-scale

96

RNA interference (RNAi) screens and large-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screens has allowed us to

97

better understand the molecular landscape of oncogenesis. Significant progress has been made

98

in discovering gene coding regions5, cancer driver genes6,7, cancer driver mutations8,9, germline

99

variants10, driver fusion genes11,12, alternatively spliced transcripts13, expression-based

100

stratification14,

101

dependencies18–21, and drug sensitivity and resistance22.

Scientific advances made to date mark the era called the “end of the beginning” of cancer

104

omics. In other words, each approach that was previously mentioned needs to be fully

105

understood as a part of a complex network, analyzing the mechanistic interplay of signaling

106

pathways, protein-protein interaction (PPi) networks, enrichment maps, gene ontology (GO),

107

deep learning, molecular dependencies and genomic alterations per intrinsic molecular subtype:

108

basal-like (estrogen receptor (ER)-, progesterone receptor (PR)-, human epidermal growth factor

109

receptor 2 (Her2)-, cytokeratin 5/6+ and/or EGFR+); Her2-enriched (ER-, PR-, Her2+); luminal A

110

(ER+ and/or PR+, Her2-, low Ki67); luminal B with Her2- (ER+ and/or PR+, Her2-, low Ki67);

111

luminal B with Her2+ (ER+ and/or PR+, Her2-, any Ki67); and normal like23–29. We will herein

112

analyze previously prioritized genes/biomarkers by the Consensus Strategy (CS)28, the Pan4

113

Cancer Atlas (PCA)3,12,30–36, the Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB)37 and the

114

Cancer Genome Interpreter (CGI)38.

115

116

In our previous studies, López-Cortés et al. and Tejera et al., developed a Consensus Strategy

117

that was proved to be highly efficient in the recognition of gene-disease association28,39. The

118

main objective was to apply several bioinformatics methods to explore BC pathogenic genes.

119

The CS identified both well-known pathogenic genes and prioritized genes that will be further

120

explored through the OncoOmics approaches. On the other hand, The Cancer Genome Atlas

121

(TCGA) has concluded the most sweeping cross-cancer analysis yet undertaken, namely the

122

PCA project31. PCA reveals how genetic alterations, such as putative mutations, fusion genes,

123

mRNA expression, copy number variants (CNVs) and protein expression collaborate in BC

124

progression, providing insights to prioritize the development of new treatments and

125

immunotherapies3,12,30–36. The CGI flags genomic biomarkers of drug response with different

126

levels of clinical relevance38. Lastly, PharmGKB is a comprehensive resource that curates and

127

spreads knowledge of the impact of clinical annotations on BC drug response37,40. PharmGKB

128

collects the precise guidelines for the application of pharmacogenomics in clinical practice

129

published by the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), the National

130

Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), the Royal Dutch Association for the Advancement of

131

Pharmacy (DPWG), the Canadian Pharmacogenomics Network for Drug Safety (CPNDS) and

132

the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC)41–44. Hence, the aim of this

133

study was to implement OncoOmics approaches to analyze genetic alterations, signaling

134

pathways, PPi networks, protein expression, BC dependencies and enrichment maps in order to

135

reveal essential genes/biomarkers to accelerate the development of precision medicine in BC.

OncoPrint of genetic alterations according to the Pan-Cancer Atlas. PCA has reported the

141

clinical data of 1084 individuals with BC and it can be visualized in the Genomic Data

142

Commons of the National Cancer Institute and in the cBioPortal45,46. In regard to molecular

143

subtypes and tumor stages, 46% were lumina A, 18% luminal B, 7% Her2-enriched, 16% basal-

144

like and 3% normal-like, whereas 17% were stage T1, 58% stage T2, 23% stage T3 and 2%

145

stage T4 (Table S1).

146

147

Figure 1A shows the average frequency of genetic alterations per gene set. The average

148

frequency of the PCA gene set was 1.3, followed by CS gene set (1.2), PharmGKB/CGI gene

149

set (1.1), BC driver genes (0.8) and non-cancer genes (0.4) (Table S2). Significant p-values (p <

150

0.001) were found among all gene sets. Therefore, the fact that gene sets of interest (CS, PCA

151

and PharmGKB/CGI) presented an average frequency of genetic alterations greater than the

152

non-cancer gene set and the BC driver gene set indicates that we are analyzing potential

153

essential genes in BC. Figure 1B shows the percentage of genetic alterations per type. The most

154

common genetic alterations were mRNA upregulation (55.8%), CNV amplification (17.1%) and

155

missense mutations (8.4%). Figure 1C shows the ratio of genetic alterations in the 230 genes per

156

sample and molecular subtype. Basal-like had the highest ratio (n = 33), followed by Her2-

157

enriched (29), luminal B (24), normal-like (17) and luminal A (15). The ratio of all BC samples

158

was 19.6. Figure 1D shows the ratio of genetic alterations in the 230 genes per sample and

159

tumor stage. Stage T2 had the highest ratio (23), followed by T3 (22), T1 (17) and T4 (8).

160

Figures 1E and 1F show the percentage of genetic alterations per subtype and tumor stage,

161

respectively. mRNA upregulation and CNV amplification were the most common alterations in

162

all molecular subtypes and tumor stages.

163

164

Figure 2 shows the ranking of genes with the greatest number of genetic alterations per

165

molecular subtype and tumor stage. Regarding molecular subtypes, PIK3CA was the most

166

altered gene in luminal A, CCND1 in luminal B, TP53 in basal-like and normal-like, and

167

ERBB2 in Her2-enriched, with significant p-values < 0.001 (Figure 2A). On the other hand, the

168

most altered genes per tumor stage were PIK3CA in stage T1, TP53 in stages T2 and T3, and

169

ERBB2 in stage T4, with significant p-value < 0.001 (Figure 2B). Figures 2C, 2E, 2G, 2I and

170

2K show the top mutated genes, CNV amplified genes, CNV deep deleted genes, mRNA

171

upregulated genes and mRNA downregulated genes per molecular subtype, respectively (Tables

172

S3-S7). On the other hand, Figures 2D, 2F, 2H, 2J and 2L show the top mutated genes, CNV

173

amplified genes, CNV deep deleted genes, mRNA upregulated genes and mRNA

174

downregulated genes per tumor stage, respectively (Tables S8-S13).

175

176

Regarding the first OncoOmics approach, Figure 3A shows an OncoPrint of 73 genes with a

177

number of genetic alterations greater than the average (> 86). For this analysis driver mutations

178

were taken into account, discarding passenger mutations (Figure S1 and Table S14). Figure 3B

179

shows a circos plot of interactions between molecular subtypes and genetic alterations of the 73

180

most altered genes. mRNA downregulated plus CNV deep deleted genes and mRNA

181

upregulated plus CNV amplified genes were more related with basal-like, whereas fusion genes,

182

and driver mutations were more related with Her2-enriched. Finally, Figure 3C shows a circos

183

plot of interactions between tumor stages and genetic alterations of the 73 most altered genes.

184

Fusion genes, mRNA downregulated plus CNV deep deleted genes, and mRNA upregulated

185

plus CNV amplified genes were more related with stage T4, whereas driver mutations were

186

more related with stage T3.

187

188

Pathway enrichment analysis. The pathway enrichment analysis was performed using David

189

Bioinformatics Resource to obtain integrated information from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of

190

Genes and Genomes (KEGG)47–50. The enrichment analysis of signaling pathways was carried

191

on in the 230 genes, obtaining more than 50 terms with a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.01

192

(Table S15). Subsequently, genetic alterations of genes that make up each signaling pathway

193

were analyzed according to the molecular subtype and tumor stage. Figure 4A shows a circos

194

plot correlating molecular subtypes with signaling pathways (Table S16). NF-kappa ß, NOD-

196

prolactin, cAMP, PI3K-AKT, neurotrophin, VEGF, notch, p53, sphingolipid and Wnt signaling

197

pathways were more altered in basal-like; estrogen, HIF1, toll-like receptor, ras, insulin, T-cell

198

receptor, rap1, ERBB, AMPK, chemokine, B-cell receptor, mTOR, Fc-epsilon RI, Jak-STAT,

199

phosphatidylinositol and thyroid hormone signaling pathways were more altered in Her2-

200

enriched; and Hippo signaling pathway in normal-like. On the other hand, Figure 4B shows the

201

ranking of the most altered signaling pathways per molecular subtype. Jak-STAT signaling

202

pathway was more altered in luminal A; Wnt signaling pathway in luminal B; p53 signaling

203

pathway in basal-like; ERBB signaling pathway in Her2-enriched; and Hippo signaling pathway

204

in normal-like (Table S17).

205

Figure 4C shows a circos plot correlating tumor stages with signaling pathways according to the

207

frequency of genetic alterations (Table S16). NOD-like receptor, adipocytokine, GnRH, TNF,

209

cell receptor, VEGF, mTOR, Fc epsilon RI, NOTCH, p53, sphingolipid and Wnt signaling

210

pathways were more altered in stage T2; NF-kappa ß, Hippo and phosphatidylinositol signaling

211

pathways were more altered in stage T3; and RIG-like receptor, HIF1, TGFß, toll-like receptor,

212

insulin, AMPK, ERBB, chemokine, neurotrophin, mTOR, jak-STAT and thyroid hormone

213

signaling pathways were more altered in stage T4. On the other hand, Figure 4D shows the

214

ranking of the most altered signaling pathways per tumor stage. Wnt signaling pathway was

215

more altered in stages T1, T2 and T3; and thyroid hormone signaling pathway was more altered

216

in stage T4 (Table S18).

218

Protein-protein interaction network. Regarding the second OncoOmics approach, the PPi

219

network was performed to better understand BC behavior using the String Database and

220

Cytoscape51,52. With the indicated cutoff of 0.9, the final interaction network had 258 nodes

221

conformed by 198 (86%) genes from the CS, PCA and PharmGKB/CGI gene sets, and enriched

222

with 60 previously known BC driver genes. Regarding the OncoPrint genes, 65 (89%) nodes

223

integrated this network (Figure 5A). On the other hand, out of the 258 genes that make up our

224

String PPi network, 16 (6%) genes and 18 edges were part of the OncoPPi BC network53,54. The

225

degree centrality made it possible to establish a significant correlation (Spearman p < 0.05)

226

between our String PPi network and the OncoPPi BC network (Figure 5B).

227

228

Considering the degree centrality and the consensus score of our previous study28, there was

229

enrichment among sub-networks (Figures 5A and 5B). The average of degree centrality of the

230

258 nodes network was 48.8; out of the 198 nodes network was 52.7; out of the 65 nodes

231

network was 61.7; and out of the OncoPPi BC network was 124.4. Meanwhile, the average of

232

consensus score of the 258 nodes network was 0.803, out of the 198 nodes network was 0.812,

233

out of the 65 nodes network was 0.833, and out of the OncoPPi BC network was 0.885.

234

Additionally, the second OncoOmics approach was made up of genes with the highest degree

235

centrality (> 52.7) such as TP53, AKT1, SRC, CREBBP, EP300, JUN, CTNNB1, PIK3CA,

236

RAC1 and EGFR, genes with the highest consensus score such as TP53, ESR1, CCND1,

237

BRCA2, BRCA1, ERBB2, CHEK2, AR, MYC and PTEN, and genes with both of them such as

238

TP53, ESR1, CCND1, ERBB2, PTEN, CDKN1B, ATM, AKT1, STAT3, CDH1 and EGFR (Table

239

S19).

240

241

Protein expression analysis. The third OncoOmics approach was related to the expression

242

analysis of the 230 proteins. Figure 6A shows 43 proteins with significant high expression (Z-

243

scores ≥ 2) and low expression (Z-scores ≤ -2) analyzed with the reverse-phase protein array

244

(RPPA) and mass spectrometry, according to TCGA. The top ten proteins with the highest

245

expression levels in a cohort of 994 individuals were ERBB2, SERPINE2, CDH2, CCND1,

246

EGFR, ERCC1, IRS1, NOTCH1, ERBB3 and INPP4B, and the ones with the lowest expression

247

levels were CDH1, ATM, JAK2, MAPK1, AKT1, AKT3, MAPK14, ABL1, CTNNB1 and IRF1

248

(Table S20). On the other hand, the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) presented a map of the human

249

tissue proteome based on tissue microarray-based immunohistochemistry. HPA has analyzed

250

202 (88%) of the 230 proteins of our study, classifying the protein expression in high, medium,

251

low and non-detected. As a result, RAC1, GJB2, MED1, PIK3CA, PIK3R3, FGFR2, HCFC2,

252

MAP2K4, NQO2 and RAC3 were proteins with high and medium expression in normal tissue,

253

and low and non-detected expression in BC tissue, acting as tumor suppressor genes.

254

Meanwhile, CDK2, CYP2D6, NCOR1, RRM1, FOXA1 and TOP2A were proteins with high and

255

medium expressions in BC tissue, and low and non-detected expressions in normal tissue,

256

acting as oncogenes (Figure 6B and Table S21). Lastly, according to the HPA, Figure 6C shows

257

the overall survival analysis of RAD51, PERP and MORC4 as BC biomarkers with unfavorable

258

prognosis and p < 0.001 (Table S22)55,56. All these altered proteins made up the third

259

OncoOmics approach.

260

261

Breast cancer dependency map. The fourth OncoOmics approach consisted in identifying

262

genes that are essential for cancer cell proliferation and survival performing systematic loss-of-

263

function screens in a large number of well-annotated cancer cell lines and BC cell lines

264

representing the tumor heterogeneity18–21. Figure 7A shows the distribution of dependency

265

scores of 227/230 genes through DEMETER2, an analytical framework for analyzing genome-

266

scale RNAi loss-of-function screens in 73 BC cell lines (Table S23). Our results showed 563

267

dependencies with at least one score ≤ -1 in 57 (25%) essential genes. The top 10 genes with the

268

greatest number of significant dependency scores in BC cell lines were RPL5 (68; 93%), SF3B1

269

(67; 92%), RPA1 (61; 84%), RRM1 (53; 73%), BUB1B (26; 36%), RPA3 (25; 34%), RAD51

270

(23; 32%), PPP2R1A (21; 29%), CHD4 (19; 26%) and POLE (13, 18%). At the same time,

271

Figure 7A shows the distribution of dependency scores of 217/230 genes through CERES, an

272

analytical framework for analyzing genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screens in 28

273

BC cell lines (Table S24). Our results showed 310 dependencies with at least one score ≤ -1 in

274

34 (16%) essential genes. The top 10 genes with the greatest number of significant dependency

275

score in BC cell lines were RPA1 (27; 96%), RRM1 (27; 96%), TOP2A (26; 93%), BUB1B (24;

276

86%) CTCF (24; 86%), POLE (23; 82%), SF3B1 (19; 68%), RPL5 (17; 61%), CCND1 (13;

277

46%) and SOD2 (13; 46%). Figure 7B shows the distribution of dependency scores of

278

DEMETER2 and CERES per molecular subtype. The genome-scale RNAi loss-of-function

279

screens detected 165 (29%) dependencies in 19 Her2-enriched cell lines (ratio = 8.7), 110 (20%)

detected 85 (27%) dependencies in 7 luminal A cell lines (ratio = 12.1), 176 (15%) in 16 basal-

283

like cell lines (11), and 49 (16%) in 5 Her2-enriched cell lines (9.8). Figure 7C shows violin

plots of dependencies per molecular subtype. DEMETER2 has detected a greatest number of

285

significant dependencies in basal-like, followed by Her2-enriched, luminal A and luminal B,

286

whereas CERES has detected a greatest number of significant dependencies in basal-like,

287

followed by luminal A and Her2-enriched. Figure 7D shows a Venn diagram of 66 essential

288

genes with at least one significant dependency in different molecular subtypes, where 22 were

289

strongly selective genes, 26 were common essential genes, and 5 were both of them in all cancer

DISCUSSION

372

373

In this study we proposed a compendium of OncoOmics approaches that analyze genetic

374

alterations, protein expression, signaling pathways, PPi networks, enrichment maps, gene

375

ontology and dependency maps in three gene sets. The first gene set was taken from our

376

previous study where we developed a Consensus Strategy that was proved to be highly efficient

377

in the recognition of BC pathogenic genes28. The second gene set was taken from several studies

378

of PCA, which provides a panoramic view of the oncogenic processes that contributes to BC

379

progression3,12,30–36. The third gene set was taken from the CGI and PharmGKB. On the one

380

hand, the CGI flags genomic biomarkers of drug response with different levels of clinical

381

relevance38. On the other hand, PharmGKB collects clinical annotations applied in BC patients

382

and taken from the NCCN, ESMO, CPNDS, DPWG and CPIC guidelines41–44. Finally, the

383

compendium of these 230 potential essential genes in BC was analyzed through four different

384

OncoOmics approaches.

385

386

The first OncoOmics approach consisted in the analysis of genetic alterations using the PCA

387

data45,46. The frequency of genetic alterations in the CS (average = 1.2), PCA (1.3) and

388

PharmGKB/CGI (1.1) gene sets were higher than the non-cancer gene set (0.4) and the

389

previously known BC driver genes (0.8). This means that these 230 genes had a greater number

390

of genetic alterations and might be strongly associated with BC (Figure 1A). The most common

391

genetic alterations in a cohort of 994 individuals were mRNA upregulation, CNV amplification

392

and missense mutations. Molecular subtypes with the greatest number of genetic alterations

393

were basal-like, Her2-enriched, luminal B, normal-like and luminal A, whereas tumor stages

394

with the greatest number of genetic alterations were T2, T3, T1 and T4 (Figures 1B-F). Genes

395

with the greatest number of genetic alterations per subtype were PIK3CA in luminal A, CCND1

396

in luminal B, TP53 in basal-like and normal-like, and ERBB2 in Her2-enriched (Figure 2A),

397

whereas PIK3CA was the most altered gene in stage T1, TP53 in stages T2 and T3, and ERBB2

398

in stage T4 (Figure 2B).

399

400

After a thorough analysis of genetic alterations in the 230 genes, the first OncoOmics approach

401

was generated by an OncoPrint conformed by the top 73 genes with the greatest number of

402

genetic alterations and with a frequency of alterations greater than the average (> 86) (Figure

403

3A). The top 10 most altered genes were PIK3CA, TP53, MDM4, CCND1, NBN, MED1,

404

CREBBP, PALB2, ERBB2 and SPOP3,12,30–36.

405

406

Subsequently, the enrichment analysis of signaling pathways was carried on taking into account

407

all genetic alterations in the 230 genes using David Bioinformatics Resource and KEGG47,50.

408

The signaling pathways with the greatest number of genetic alterations per intrinsic molecular

409

subtype were Jak-STAT in luminal A, Wnt in luminal B, p53 in basal-like, ERBB in Her2-

410

enriched and Hippo in normal-like (Figure 4B); and per tumor stage were Wnt in stages T1, T2

411

and T3, and thyroid hormone in stage T4 (Figure 4D).

412

413

Regarding the previously mentioned signaling pathways, Jak-STAT is involved in the control of

414

processes, such as stem cell maintenance, hematopoiesis and inflammatory response. However,

415

the mechanism underlying inappropriate Jak-STAT pathway activation is not well-known in

416

BC73. The Wnt signaling pathway actively functions in embryonic development and helps in

417

homeostasis in mature tissues by regulating cell survival, migration, proliferation and polarity74.

418

The p53 tumor suppressor is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer75, and acting as

419

a transcription factor, the p53 signaling pathway plays a critical role in growth-inhibition,

420

apoptosis, cell migration and angiogenesis76. The ERBB signaling pathway members form cell-

421

surface receptors with extracellular domains yielding ligand-binding specificity77. Downstream

422

signaling proceeds via tyrosine phosphorylation mediating signal transduction events that

423

control cell survival, migration and proliferation. However, aberrant ERBB activation can

424

increase transcriptional expression78. The Hippo pathway plays important roles in immune

425

response, stem cell function and tumor suppression. However, alterations in this pathway are

426

involved in the BC tumorigenesis and metastasis79. Lastly, the thyroid hormone signaling

427

pathway is an important regulator of growth and metabolism. Nevertheless, deregulation of the

428

T3 hormone levels could promote abnormal responsiveness of mammary epithelial cells

429

developing BC80.

430

431

The second OncoOmics approach consisted in the PPi network analysis and its validation with

432

the OncoPPi BC network. According to Li et al. and Ivanov et al.54,81, PPi with therapeutic

433

significance can be revealed by the integration of cancer genes into networks. PPi regulates

434

essential oncogenic signals to cell proliferation and survival, and thus, represents potential

435

targets for drug development and drug discovery. Regarding our networking analysis, the final

436

interaction network consisted in 258 nodes with an average of degree centrality of 48.8 and an

437

average of consensus scoring of 0.80328; the sub-network integrated by 198 of 230 nodes had

438

52.7 of degree centrality and 0.812 of consensus scoring; finally, the sub-network integrated by

439

65 of 73 genes with the greatest number of genetic alterations had 61.7 of degree centrality and

440

0.833 of consensus scoring. Hence, a sub-network of genes with greatest number of genetic

441

alterations presented a greater degree centrality and consensus scoring, suggesting that there is

442

strong correlation between these genes and BC. Additionally, the oncogenomics validation

443

showed a significant correlation between our String PPi network (Figure 5A) and the OncoPPi

444

BC network (Figure 5B), identifying 16 nodes strongly associated with BC28. The second

445

OncoOmics approach was made up with the top 40 genes with the highest degree centrality and

446

consensus scoring, such as TP53, ESR1, CCND1, ERBB2, PTEN, CDKN1B, ATM, AKT1,

447

STAT3, CDH1 and EGFR.

448

449

The third OncoOmics approach was related to the BC proteome. More than 500 proteins have

450

been identified as strongly involved in oncogenesis. Loss of expression, overexpression or

451

expression of dysfunctional proteins contribute to uncontrolled tumor growth, causing

452

chromosomal rearrangements, gene amplification and ungoverned methylation59. Regarding our

453

230 proteins, 43 showed significant high and low expression (p < 0.001), according to TCGA.

454

The top ten proteins with the highest expression levels were ERBB2, SERPINE2, CDH2,

455

CCND1, EGFR, ERCC1, IRS1, NOTCH1, ERBB3 and INPP4B, whereas the top ten proteins

456

with the lowest expression levels were CDH1, ATM, JAK2, MAPK1, AKT1, AKT3, MAPK14,

457

ABL1, CTNNB1 and IRF1. On the other hand, the HPA has analyzed 202 of 230 proteins, where

458

FOXA1, TOP2A, CDK2, CYP2D6, NCOR1 and RRM1 were involved in oncogenic processes,

459

and RAC1, GJB2, MED1, PIK3CA, PIK3R3, FGFR2, HCFC2, MAP2K4, NQO2 and RAC3

460

were involved in tumor suppression processes. Lastly, genes with unfavorable prognosis in BC

461

were RAD51, PERP and MORC4 (Figure 6)55,56. The compendium of all these 60 proteins with

462

significant high and low expression made up the third OncoOmics approach.

463

464

The fourth OncoOmics approach was related to the BC dependency map. According to

465

Tsherniak et al., the mutations that trigger the growth of cancer cells also confer specific

466

vulnerabilities that normal cells lack, and these dependencies are compelling therapeutic

467

targets82. The cancer dependency map identifies essential genes in proliferation and survival of

468

well-annotated cell lines through systematic loss-of-function screens18–21. On the one hand,

469

DETEMER2 analyzed the genome-scale RNAi loss-of-function screens. The top 10 genes with

470

the greatest number of significant dependency scores in BC cell lines were RPL5, SF3B1,

471

RPA1, RRM1, BUB1B, RPA3, RAD51, PPP2R1A, CHD4 and POLE. On the other hand,

472

CERES analyzed the genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screens. The top 10 genes

473

with the greatest number of significant dependencies in BC cell lines were RPA1, RRM1,

474

TOP2A, BUB1B, CTCF, POLE, SF3B1, RPL5, CCND1 and SOD2 (Figure 7A). Additionally,

475

the fourth OncoOmics approach was made up of genes with significant dependencies in BC cell

476

lines and all cancer cell lines. PLCG1, CDK4, KRAS, SPOP, CTNNB1, EGFR, AKT1, JAK2,

477

MDM4, FGFR1, IRS1, BCL2, RELA, GATA3, PIK3CA, PIK3RE, PIK3CB, FOXA1, ERBB3,

478

FGFR2, ESR1 and ERBB2 were strongly selective genes, whereas CDH4, TOP2A, GNL3,

479

RBBP8, TOP3A, SMARCB1, UROD, RPL5, RAD51, PDPK1, CCNK, SF3B1, CDC42, ERCC2,

480

BUB1B, CTCF, MAX, CCND1, BARD1, RAC1, RPA3, SMARCE1, PPP2R1A, POLE, RPA1 and

481

GRB2 were common essential genes, and SOD2, CDK2, ATR, RRM1 and MED1 were both

482

(Figure 7E).

483

484

Subsequently, the compendium of the most relevant genes per OncoOmics approach reveals the

485

144 OncoOmics essential genes in BC (Figure 8A). RAC1, AKT1, CCND1, PIK3CA and ERBB2

486

were relevant genes in all OncoOmics approaches; CDH1, MAPK14, TP53, MAPK1, SRC and

487

RAC3 were relevant genes in the OncoPrint, networking and protein expression analyses;

488

PLCG1 and GJB2 were relevant genes in the OncoPrint, networking and DepMap analyses;

489

MED1, TOP2A and GATA3 were relevant genes in the DepMap, OncoPrint and protein

490

expression analyses; and BCL2, CTNNB1, EGFR and CDK2 were relevant in the DepMap,

491

networking and protein expression analyses. Lastly, the top 10 genes with the greatest number

492

of interactions with the hallmarks of cancer were TP53, CTNNB1, PTEN, KRAS, AKT1, RAC1,

493

EGFR, ABL1, RB1 and NOTCH1 (Figure 8D).

495

According to Reimand et al., g:Profiler lets us know the enrichment map of the 144 OncoOmics

496

essential genes in BC83. The most significant GO: biological process was the positive regulation

497

of macromolecule metabolic process, the GO: molecular function was phosphatidylinositol 3-

498

kinase activity, the Reactome pathway was generic transcriptor pathway, and the most

499

significant Human Phenotype Ontology term was breast carcinoma69. Subsequently, the most

501

related to immune system, tyrosine kinase, cell cycle and DNA repair terms (Figures 9 and

502

S2)52,67.

503

504

There is currently great enthusiasm about immunotherapeutic strategies to treat BC. The first

505

approval of an immune checkpoint blockade agent for treatment of BC came in March 2019

506

when the anti-PD-L1 antibody atezolizumab was approved to be used in combination with nab-

507

paclitaxel for patients with triple-negative BC84. 17 OncoOmics essential genes were associated

508

with immunotherapy62. Kinases have been recognized as highly tractable targets for BC

509

treatment due to their druggability and critical roles they play in regulating cellular migration,

510

differentiation, growth and survival85. 17 OncoOmics essential genes in BC were kinome

511

genes63. The cell cycle comprises a series of tightly controlled events that drive cell division and

512

the DNA replication86. 12 OncoOmics essential genes in BC were involved in cell cycle64. DNA

513

repair constitutes several signaling pathways working in concert to eliminate DNA lesions and

514

maintain genome stability. Defective components in DNA repair machinery are an underlying

515

cause for the development of BC87. 19 OncoOmics essential genes in BC were involved in the

516

DNA repair system65. RBPs are key players in post-transcriptional events88,89. Three recent

517

reports using high-throughput bioinformatics profiling of thousands of tumors now reveal a

518

consistent pattern of alterations in RBPs expression levels across different cancer types90–92.

519

Lastly, 11 OncoOmics essential genes were RBPs (Figure 8C)66.

520

521

Precision medicine provides BC patients with the most appropriate diagnostics and targeted

522

therapies based on the omics profile and other predictive and prognostic tests. Additionally, it is

523

relevant to know the composition of their breast tissue, tumor microenvironment, comorbid

524

conditions and lifestyle93.

526

The OTP is an available resource for the integration of genetics, omics and chemical data to aid

527

systematic drug target identification and prioritization70. Currently, there are 111 drugs that are

annotations made up of 32 genes and 51 drugs in order to facilitate the treatment of patients

541

with BC (Figure S3).

542

543

In conclusion, since BC is a complex and heterogeneous disease, the study of different

544

OncoOmics approaches is an effective way to reveal essential genes to better understand the

545

molecular landscape of processes behind oncogenesis, and to develop better therapeutic

546

treatments focused on pharmacogenomics and precision medicine.

METHODS

550

551

OncoPrint of genetic alterations according to the Pan-Cancer Atlas. PCA has reported the

552

clinical data of 1084 individuals with BC and it can be visualized in the Genomic Data

553

Commons of the National Cancer Institute (https://gdc.cancer.gov/) and in the cBioPortal

554

(http://www.cbioportal.org/)45,46. The clinical annotations were age, pTNM classification, tumor

555

type, tumor stage and race/ethnicity.

downregulation, CNV amplification, CVN deep deletion, missense mutation, truncating

559

mutation, inframe mutation and fusion gene) in 994 individuals. Putative mutations were

560

analyzed through exome sequencing, CNVs through the Genomic Identification of Significant

561

Targets in Cancer (GISTIC 2.0)94,95, and mRNA expression through RNA Seq V2. We analyzed

562

five gene sets in order to compare the average frequency of genetic alterations among them. The

563

first gene set (n = 177) was integrated by the non-cancer genes96. We calculated the OncoScore

564

of non-cancer genes, taking out all genes from our study. The second gene set (n = 119) was the

565

BC driver genes, according to The Network of Cancer Genes61. The third gene set (n = 84) was

566

taken from our previous study where we developed a Consensus Strategy of prioritized genes

567

related to BC pathogenesis28. The fourth gene set (n = 85) was made up of genes associated with

568

BC development, according to several PCA studies30,31,57. The fifth gene set (n = 91) consisted

569

of BC biomarkers and druggable enzymes taken from PharmGKB and the CGI (Table S2)37,38,40.

570

Finally, the significant differentiation of the average frequency of genetic alterations among

571

gene sets was analyzed (p-value < 0.001).

572

573

The OncoOmics approaches were performed in 230 genes conformed by the CS, PCA and

574

PharmGKB/CGI gene sets. Firstly, we calculated the percentage and ratio of genetic alterations

575

per intrinsic molecular subtype and tumor stage, and we established a ranking of genes with the

576

greatest number of different genetic alterations. Subsequently, we performed an OncoPrint of

577

genes with more genetic alterations than the average. The final list of genes made up the first

578

OncoOmics approach.

579

580

Pathway enrichment analysis. The enrichment analysis of signaling pathways was performed

581

using David Bioinformatics Resource to obtain integrated information from KEGG47–50. It was

582

carried on in the 230 genes, taking into account terms with a significant FDR < 0.01. After that,

583

genetic alterations that comprise each signaling pathway were analyzed, taking into account the

584

molecular subtype and tumor stage of individuals from PCA. Circos plots and violin plots were

585

designed to visualize all data. Lastly, in order to compare the ratio of genetic alterations among

586

subtypes and tumor stages, normalization was carried out dividing the number of genetic

587

alterations by the number of individuals per subtype and tumor stage. Regarding molecular

588

subtypes, 499 individuals were luminal A, 197 were luminal B, 171 were basal-like, 78 were

589

Her2-enriched and 36 were normal-like, and regarding tumor stage, 255 were stage T1, 586

590

were stage T2, 113 were stage T3 and 103 were stage T4.

591

592

Protein-protein interaction network. The PPi network with a highest confidence cutoff of 0.9

593

and zero node addition was created using the String Database, which takes into account

594

predicted and known interactions51. The confidence scoring is the approximate probability that a

595

predicted link exists between two enzymes in the same metabolic map, whereas the degree

596

centrality of a node means the number of edges the node has to other nodes in a network. The

597

centrality indexes calculation and network visualization were analyzed through the Cytoscape

598

software52. Genes with the highest degree centrality, consensus score and sub-networks were

identifying more than 260 high-confidence cancer-associated PPi53,54. In addition, the OncoPPi

602

BC network consisted of 16 genes and 18 PPi experimentally analyzed in BC cell lines53,54. The

603

correlation of the degree centrality by means of Spearman p-value test between our String PPi

604

network and the OncoPPi BC network allowed for the validation of all the high-confidence BC-

focused PPi analyzed in cell lines28. Lastly, genes with the highest degree centrality and

609

with BC through RPPA and mass spectrometry by the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis

610

Consortium (CPTAC), and it can be visualized in the cBioPortal45,46. We analyzed the protein

611

expression of 230 genes (CS, PCA and PharmGKB/CGI gene sets) where Z-scores ≥ 2 mean a

612

significant high protein expression and Z-scores ≤ -2 mean a significant low protein expression.

622

Breast cancer dependency map. The DepMap project (https://depmap.org/portal/) is a

623

collaboration between the Broad Institute and the Welcome Sanger Institute. Multiple genetic or

624

epigenetic changes provide cancer cells with specific vulnerabilities that normal cells lack. Even

625

though the landscape of genetic alterations has been extensively studied to date, we have limited

626

understanding of the biological impact of these alterations in the development of specific tumor

627

vulnerabilities, which triggers a limited use of precision medicine in the clinical practice

628

worldwide. Therefore, the main goal of DepMap is to create a comprehensive preclinical

629

reference map connecting tumor features with tumor dependencies to accelerate the

630

development of precision treatments18–21.

631

632

In order to identify essential genes for BC cell proliferation and survival, DepMap performed

633

systematic loss-of-function screens in a large number of well-annotated BC cell lines

634

representing the tumor heterogeneity and their molecular subtypes. The DEMETER2 algorithm

635

was applied to analyze genome-scale RNAi loss-of-function screens in 73 BC cell lines and 711

636

cancer cell lines, whereas the CERES algorithm was applied to analyze genome-scale CRISPR-

637

Cas9 loss-of-function screens in 28 BC cell lines and 558 cancer cell lines19,21. In addition to

638

existing cell lines, the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) project will greatly expand the

639

collection of characterized cell lines to improve precision treatments97.

641

Regarding dependency scores, a lower score means that a gene is more likely to be dependent in

642

a specific cancer cell line. A score of 0 means that a gene is not essential, whereas a score of -1

643

corresponds to the median of all common essential genes. A strongly selective gene means that

644

its dependency is at least 100 times more likely to have been sampled from a skewed

645

distribution than a normal distribution. Lastly, a common essential gene is when in a pan-cancer

646

screen its gene ranks in the top most depleting genes in at least 90% of cell lines18. All genes

647

with a dependency score ≤ -1 made up the fourth OncoOmics approach.

and visualization of potential drug targets associated with BC. Additionally, this platform shows
