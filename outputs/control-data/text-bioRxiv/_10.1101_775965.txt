Abstract
Dengue has enormous health impacts globally. A novel approach to decrease dengue incidence
involves the introduction of Wolbachia endosymbionts that block dengue virus transmission
into populations of the primary vector mosquito, Aedes aegypti. The wMel Wolbachia strain
has previously been trialed in open releases of Ae. aegypti; however the wAlbB strain has been
shown to maintain higher density than wMel at high larval rearing temperatures. Releases of
Ae. aegypti mosquitoes carrying wAlbB were carried out in 6 diverse sites in greater Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia, with high endemic dengue transmission. The strain was successfully
established and maintained at very high population frequency at some sites, or persisted with
additional releases following fluctuations at other sites. Based on passive case monitoring,
reduced human dengue incidence was observed in the release sites when compared to control
sites. The wAlbB strain of Wolbachia provides a promising option as a tool for dengue control,
particularly in very hot climates.

There are around 90 million symptomatic cases of dengue each year [1] with severe disease in
around 1% of cases, including life-threatening haemorrhage or shock syndrome. Reducing
abundance of the primary vector mosquito Aedes aegypti using insecticides and breeding site
reduction remain the main strategies for dengue control, but are relatively ineffective. The
introduction of Wolbachia endosymbionts into Ae. aegypti and demonstration of dengue
transmission-blocking [2-6] has been followed by the use of the wMel strain (from Drosophila
melanogaster) for ‘population replacement’, resulting in this strain reaching and maintaining a
high and stable frequency in north Queensland [7-9], where there has been a near-cessation of
imported dengue outbreaks [10].

Wolbachia replacement involves the induction of cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), a
reproductive manipulation imposing a pattern of crossing sterility that provides an advantage
to Wolbachia-carrying females. CI enables rapid spread to high frequency in insect populations
once a threshold frequency has been exceeded, depending on host fitness parameters and CI /
maternal transmission rates [7, 11, 12]. Different Wolbachia strains vary considerably in their
effects on Ae. aegypti fitness parameters [13-16], and thus their population invasion /
maintenance capacity (indeed strain wMelPop, a higher-replicating variant of wMel with high
fitness cost, was unable to maintain itself in Ae. aegypti populations [15]).

Recent reports suggested that wMel may show reduced density and cytoplasmic
incompatibility when Ae. aegypti larvae are reared at high temperatures [13-14, 16], which also
matched temperatures previously recorded in wild Ae. aegypti larval sites elsewhere [17];
larvae in containers exposed to sunlight for part of the day would experience even higher
temperatures than the recorded ambient air temperatures. However, wAlbB proved to be much
less susceptible to the effects of similar high rearing temperatures [14, 16]. This suggests that
wAlbB might be well suited for population replacement in hot environments, given its ability
to effectively block transmission of dengue and other arboviruses [5]; wAlbB has not
previously been deployed in this way.

The primary aim of these field trials was to assess whether wAlbB can be established /
maintained at high frequency in urban Ae. aegypti in greater Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and
what conditions are most conducive to establishment. In Malaysia over 100,000 dengue cases
were reported in 2016, with an annual cost estimated at $175 million [18, 19]. Extended periods
with daily peak temperatures exceeding 36C occur in Kuala Lumpur. In light of Wolbachia
strain difference in temperature responses, which may impact both the Wolbachia population

frequency and the efficacy of dengue blocking in wild populations, this hot tropical
environment provides an opportunity to test whether wAlbB-carrying Ae. aegypti with different
effects on host fitness components to wMel [14, 16] can invade an area where dengue is
endemic. Information was also collected on dengue incidence in release areas and in matched
control sites.

Intervention sites with persistent occurrence of dengue over the previous four years were
selected (Table 1), in accordance with a WHO-recommended criterion for dengue intervention
trial design [20]. Four primary intervention sites were chosen in Selangor State to represent
different building types in order to explore Wolbachia wAlbB spread and maintenance
dynamics in different settings (Table 1; Fig. S1): high-rise (18 floor) apartment buildings, 4/5floor flats, 5 floor combined shop and flat buildings, landed terraces, and landed houses (Fig.
1). For two of the sites, releases were also conducted at adjacent smaller secondary sites with
different building type. Where possible, boundaries to mosquito movement on at least a portion
of the perimeter were incorporated in order to minimize immigration from surrounding areas highways of six lanes and above / rivers / grassland and park areas [21]. Estimates of Aedes
species composition and population size over time were obtained using ovitraps (Figs. 2, S2,
S3). Ae. albopictus is present at all the sites (Fig. S3) (the latter is to be targeted subsequently
for replacement releases using dengue-blocking strains [22, 23]. Community engagement is a
very important component of Wolbachia transmission-blocking programs, given that biting
female mosquitoes must be released into the environment; community consent and strong
support for releases was obtained in all sites (see Materials and Methods).

In order to obtain a fit, locally adapted and competitive Ae. aegypti wAlbB line for release [16],
four generations of backcrossing to field-collected local material were carried out. An
important factor in relative fitness is insecticide resistance, given increasing levels of resistance
[24] (particularly to pyrethroids). Susceptibility was compared between F1 adults from fieldcollected individuals and the release line using bioassays and found to be similar for
pyrethroids, as well as to the organophosphates fenitrothion and pirimiphos (Fig. S4). The
backcrossed Ae. aegypti wAlbB line was mass reared in preparation for releases. Wing
measurements taken from mass-reared adults were in the range expected to produce fit,
competitive release mosquitoes based on studies with Australian Ae. aegypti [25, 26] (average
(SD) for males 2.28 (0.10) mm, females 2.96 (0.11) mm).

Wolbachia invasion depends on it exceeding a frequency dictated by fitness effects,
incompatibility and maternal transmission; this was used to estimate required release rate with
the ovitrap index (traps positive for Ae. aegypti divided by total traps per site) providing an
estimate of population size [7]. Adult mosquitoes were released weekly in the morning on a
pre-determined grid (with one cup of 50 mosquitoes released on a grid on ground / second
floors in Section 7 and on every third floor in Mentari Court). After around 4 weeks of releases,
Wolbachia frequency monitoring commenced using ovitraps, with the resulting eggs returned
to the laboratory, raised to adults and a selection of the Ae. aegypti samples from each trap used
for Wolbachia qPCR analysis [27]. In one of the sites, Section 7 Commercial Centre, eggs
rather than adults were released: covered containers to which approximately 200 eggs in 400
mL water with larval food had been added (Fig. S5) were left out for 2 weeks for the adults to
emerge on site.

Wolbachia frequency rose rapidly to over 80% at all sites (Fig. 3). Following the cessation of
releases, the Wolbachia frequency has remained stable and high (98% 12 months after releases
ceased) in Mentari Court. At the AU2 and Section 7 Flat sites, the frequency exceeded 95%
but subsequently fluctuated following cessation of releases. Immigration of Wolbachia-free
mosquitoes from surrounding untreated areas can reduce Wolbachia frequency where there is
a low population size and relatively weak boundary barriers to mosquito population movement
[21] which occurred at these locations; also in Section 7 Flats a 29-hectare construction site
(‘i-City’), 159 m from the release zone, likely provided larval breeding sites and a source of
wildtype Wolbachia-free migrants. Therefore, it was decided to resume releases at a lower
release rate, whereupon Wolbachia frequencies rapidly rose again (Fig. 3).

Population size monitoring before and during the releases (Fig. 2) also confirmed that there
were no major population spikes associated with the release phase in the sites; this is expected
given that mating between released males and wild females result in embryo death due to
cytoplasmic incompatibility, balancing the population-increasing effects of female releases. In
fact, in some sites post-Wolbachia establishment Ae. aegypti population density appeared to be
lower than previously recorded based on ovitrap index (Fig. 2). More data are needed to support
this observation, but the trend is consistent with a population suppressing effect caused by the
fitness cost associated with wAlbB, particularly with respect to a steadily increasing mortality
over time of desiccated eggs when added to water for hatching [16]. Areas with a higher
proportion of temporary rather than permanent breeding sites, where periodic flushing of
quiescent eggs is important, are predicted to experience a higher level of population
suppression following invasion. Post-release community surveys revealed that a majority of
residents did not notice any increase in mosquito biting (Fig. S6).

Human dengue incidence from 2013-2019 were compared between release sites and matched
control sites, based on data recorded by the Malaysian National Dengue Surveillance System.
Control sites were selected for comparable dengue incidence to the release sites in the period
from 2013 to the start of releases (Table 1); within the same District as the release site where
possible, to ensure similar non-Wolbachia dengue control activities (except that a wider area
was used for some of the Mentari Court sites, in order to ensure that some sites with similar or
higher incidence compared to the release site could be identified); and building type of the
‘primary’ site in each location, to meet similar mosquito and human population characteristics
(size, movement, etc.) (Table 1). Dengue incidence was reduced following releases in all
intervention sites (Figs. 4, S7). A Bayesian time series model [28-30] produced an estimate of
dengue case reduction of 40.3% over all intervention sites (95% credible interval 5.06 – 64.59)
(Fig. S8), with posterior probability of a reduction in intervention sites post-release of 0.985.

In the 18-floor apartment buildings of Mentari Court, prior to Wolbachia releases dengue cases
were high since at least 2013 (Fig. 4) despite intensive control efforts involving repeated rounds
of clean-up ‘source reduction’ coupled with community engagement, and repeated thermal
fogging (Fig. 5), none of which proved effective in reducing dengue incidence. The
introduction of Wolbachia wAlbB has, in contrast, reduced dengue cases to a point where
insecticide fogging by the local health authorities was no longer considered necessary (Figs.
4,5).

The results indicate the successful introduction of wAlbB Wolbachia into release sites in
Selangor. The frequency of wAlbB has remained high at two sites following invasion (Mentari
Court, Commercial Centre) and the frequency at Mentari Court is currently still >90%, two
years after releases were terminated. An important consideration with respect to achieving

stable high Wolbachia frequency is Ae. aegypti population size versus movement; in Mentari
Court there is a relatively high population per unit ground area compared to the Section 7 zones,
given Ae. aegypti were collected in ovitraps all the way up to the 18th floor. This will need to
be incorporated into the design of wider strategy roll-out; for example buffer release zones
should be incorporated around the perimeter of high-transmission localities that have small
area, low Ae. aegypti population size or no clear natural boundaries to Ae. aegypti movement.
The importance of area size in successful invasions has previously been recognized for wMel
introductions in Cairns, Australia, where Wolbachia failed to establish at one small site
following releases despite successfully establishing at larger nearby release sites [21].

The successful deployment of egg containers for release at the Commercial Centre site has
proven to be logistically much less laborious than adult releases and will also greatly facilitate
wider roll-out. This reflects the fact that eggs produced in the laboratory can be easily cut into
strips and transported to the field, where water and food can be added to containers. In contrast,
adult releases require transfer of larvae to release containers where they can pupate and eclose,
which requires additional handling of the immature stages by laboratory personnel. Egg
containers were previously used in releases of wMel in Townsville, Australia, where they also
proved successful [10]. However, if density-dependent processes occur in such containers it
could slow the rate of Wolbachia invasion [31].

The dengue incidence data points to a reduction in incidence at release sites following
Wolbachia introductions when compared to control sites. Reduction to zero cases would not
be an expected outcome even if the strategy is 100% efficient, given that Ae. aegypti bite during
the daytime and thus dengue can be acquired outside of the place of residence (for example at
work or school) during the day, and also given that Ae. albopictus is abundant at these sites
(Fig. S3) and has yet to be targeted using Wolbachia replacement. Both factors make the effect
of the intervention more difficult to detect with passive surveillance as was used here; only the
effects of Wolbachia on local transmission of dengue by Ae. aegypti in the release zone are
being detected in these comparisons. Nevertheless, clear differences in incidence between
intervention and control sites were observed. The overall effect size produced by the Bayesian
model of 40% dengue case reduction is thus a conservative estimate; active surveillance using
seroconversion of naïve pre-school children would provide a more accurate measure of the
effect of the releases on local transmission, given a much higher proportion of locally acquired
cases are expected in this cohort [20], but this was beyond the budget and scope of the current
study.

In summary, the results clearly demonstrate the capacity of Wolbachia strain wAlbB in urban
Ae. aegypti to become established and maintain itself at high frequency in Ae. aegypti
populations. Releases in a larger number of diverse intervention sites are now being undertaken
in conjunction with the Malaysian Ministry of Health to comprehensively evaluate wAlbB
effects on dengue transmission in different settings. The cessation of fogging in the release
zones due to reduced dengue cases also points to the economic sustainability of the approach,
given that large sums are spent annually on insecticides for dengue control [19]. Longer periods
of dengue monitoring post-release will further increase the accuracy of the estimated effect
size of the intervention on dengue incidence, and as more areas become Wolbachia-positive
the proportion of imported cases will also fall. The establishment of wAlbB under high
temperature conditions as reported here points to it being a promising option for deployment
in very hot tropical climates. Transmission blocking for other viruses including Zika,
chikungunya, and yellow fever could also be achieved using Wolbachia [4, 32, 33].

To maximize the fitness and competitiveness of the mosquitoes to be released, backcrossing to
freshly field-collected material was carried out. A total of 100 3-5 day-old females from the
wAlbB Wolbachia line [16] were placed into 24 x 24 x 24 cm cages, together with the same
number of 3-5 day-old males per cage of F1 / F2 mosquitoes from Shah Alam. After being left
for mating for 2-3 days, they were allowed to blood feed on mice (Malaysian National Institute
of Health approval number NMRR-16-297-28898). F1 females were then crossed to males of
the field strain, again F1 / F2, to obtain the backcross one (B1) generation. The process was
repeated twice to obtain generation B3. The presence of Wolbachia at 100% frequency was
confirmed in the B3 generation by qPCR as described below.

Eggs were weighed on paper in 0.225 g lots (approx. 15000 eggs) and submerged in tap water
(after 1 week of desiccation) in plastic containers (16 x 16 x 8 cm), after being exposed to an
air vacuum to stimulate hatching. Eggs were then transferred to a 36 x 26 x 5.5 cm trays
containing 1 L of tap water. Two days after hatching, L2 larvae from the 15000 eggs were
sieved and transferred into 500 mL beakers filled with seasoned water (tap water stored
overnight to dechlorinise). Aliquots of larvae were taken from the beaker using 10 mL plastic
pipette tips (50 larvae per aliquoted mL). Ten aliquots (1 mL each) were placed into 36 x 26 x
5.5 cm trays filled with 1 L seasoned water. Cow liver powder (Difco, Becton, Dickinson and
Co, Sparks, MD USA) and half-cooked cow liver were supplied to larvae daily at rates of .06,
.08, .16, .31, .64, .32, .32, .32, .16, .08 and .06 mg per larva from days 1 to 11.

Pupae were transferred into small plastic containers with seasoned water and transferred into a
mosquito cage (approximately 1000 pupae per cage). The mosquitoes were supplied with 10%
sucrose solution with vitamin B complex. For blood feeding, two laboratory-reared mice were
left in the cage overnight. Two days post-feeding, ovitraps (diameter 7 cm, height 9 cm) lined
with A4 paper and with 200 mL of seasoned water were left for egg laying for four days. The
paper was dried and then sealed in a plastic bag until use.

Wing measurements were carried out periodically on 15 mass reared males and 15 females for
quality control. Both left and right wings of individual mosquitoes were dissected and measured
under saline using DIMAS Professional version 5.0 (2) and an SSZ-T-3.5x mm graticule.

Adult bioassays for insecticide resistance were carried out using strains from field Ae. aegypti
from Shah Alam and Wolbachia-carrying Ae. aegypti, together with a susceptible Kuala
Lumpur laboratory strain that has been in culture for over 1000 generations. One commonlyused pyrethroid (permethrin) and two organophosphates (fenithrothion and pirimiphos methyl)
were tested. For the field-derived samples, 20-100 larvae were sourced from ovitraps and reared
for 1-5 generations in the lab. The Wolbachia mosquito colony was also derived from Shah
Alam (see above). Larvae were raised on liver powder and 3-5 day-old adult females were
tested.

The bioassays followed the WHO resistance test (WHO, 2016) using insecticide impregnated
papers (Vector Control Research Unit, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Penang. 10-20 adult females
were used for each of the three biological replicates. The adults were exposed to papers
impregnated with permethrin 0.25%, pirimiphos methyl 0.25% and fenitrothion 1.0%. Two
controls were also set up for each treatment. Knockdown was scored every 5 min during a 1 hr
exposure period. After exposure, the mosquitoes were transferred into paper cups with cotton
soaked in 10% sugar solution. Mortality was recorded after 24 hrs. Tests were repeated during
the period that the colony was used for releases, except in the case of pirimiphos methyl that
was tested twice.

This strategy requires community engagement and consultation: acceptance and support of the
community are essential for the releases. Printed educational materials containing clear
information (e.g. leaflets, posters, buntings and banners) on Wolbachia were displayed and
distributed. A website was established for the Wolbachia Malaysia Project linked at
www.imr.gov.my/wolbachia. The target group to engage was the head of household and
communities. To engage the public, interactions were initiated with local government / political
/ religious and community leaders, using information kits, workshops / roadshows, meetings /
briefings, carnivals and home visits. A total of 40 stakeholders and community engagement
activities were conducted in places of worship and community halls. Communities and Ahli
Dewan Undangan Negeri (State Assemblyman) were also invited to the Institute for Medical
Research to experience first-hand the science of Wolbachia. These activities were designed so
that the communities would possess a sense of belonging to the programme, and feel that their
involvement was recognized. Public meetings reinforced the ground-level support for the trials
as reflected by a willingness of community members to participate in the program. This high
level of support continued throughout the release periods.

Engagement by a team from IPTK (Institute for Health Behavioural Research) in all 6 release
sites was conducted by undertaking lectures / talks, using brochures, undertaking advertised
discussions with resident groups, posting banners & bunting, providing information on a
website, as well as by sending messages to resident through WhatsApp, and SMS. There were
between 4 and 17 activities at a release site including meetings, briefings, dialogue, carnivals
and home visits (fewer activities were carried out at sites that were used later in releases as
information about the releases spread). All activities involved local political leaders,
community leaders and residents. The aim was to get the community's trust in Wolbachia
releases and the target of the community engagement team was at least 80% of the population
having been exposed to the Wolbachia program through one or more of these approaches. The
majority of the resident populations in three sites were tenants (65-70% Flat PKNS Section 7,
60-70% Mentari Court, and 80% in Section 7 Commercial Centre); tenants were in general less
responsive and less involved in lecture activities and group discussion compared to
homeowners. In the AU2 Landed, Section 7 Landed and AU2 Flats sites, none of the residents
were tenants.

The IPTK team carrying out engagement continuously sought community feedback throughout
the period and found that the 80% exposure target was not reached in some release sites. Hence
the IPTK team, after discussing with the head of the blocks and apartments as well as Joint
Management Board (JMB), decided at these release sites to obtain agreement for project
implementation from community leaders and each community Joint Management Board.

In Shah Alam Section 7 Flats and Section 7 Landed sites, the vast majority of residents
surveyed agreed to be involved in the Wolbachia mosquito release project: 99.6% (650 of 652)
of responding households gave their approval for the project. In AU2 Landed and AU2 Flats,
98.4% (501 of 509) of responding households gave their approval to the project. In Shah Alam,
of those responding to the survey 62.9% were male and 27.5% female, while in AU2 Keramat,
50.7% were male and 33.2% female; those responding by WhatsApp and URL were
unidentified and accounted for 9.7% and 16.1% from Shah Alam and AU2, respectively. In
Mentari Court, the target group involved 20 community leaders rather than residents because
attendance at resident meetings was low. All community leaders agreed to the release of
Wolbachia in all the blocks and car parks in Mentari Court. The community engagement in
Section 7 Commercial Centre involved briefing community leaders on the Wolbachia project
by the IPTK team. After engagement, all 14 community leaders agreed for Commercial Centre
Section 7 to be included in the project. The community leaders requested Wolbachia videos
and health promotion materials for distribution to businesses, shops, houses and other premises,
and this was provided.

For all release sites, the Wolbachia mosquito release progress was shared with the communities
by inviting community representatives to the Institute on several occasions. An engagement
activity in the community was also run where the development of Wolbachia carrying Aedes
aegypti larvae were monitored in egg release breeding containers directly exposed to sunlight,
partially shaded areas and shaded areas.

Feedback surveys on Wolbachia interventions were conducted prior to and after releases.
Questions included the public perceptions to Wolbachia releases and dengue, the perception of
the mosquito population size before, during and after the releases, the level of confidence in
Wolbachia reducing dengue cases, opinions on breeding sites reduction after Wolbachia
releases and level of concern about dengue transmission. Approximately a year after release
initiation, the communities from the release sites were again invited four times for briefings
and updates on the progress of the programme.

A risk assessment was completed and permission was obtained for Wolbachia releases after
being examined by NIH and unconditionally approved by the Malaysian Medical Research and
Ethics Committee (MREC) (reference number KKM/NIHSEC/P16-566).

The areas of the 6 release sites are provided in Table 1 and maps of the sites are provided in
Fig. 1. The dates for releases in Section 7 Flats, Section 7 Landed, Mentari Court, and
Commercial Centre were 13 May 2017, 13 May 2017, 16 October 2017 and 20 November 2017
respectively, while the dates for AU2 Landed and AU2 Flats were 28 March 2017 and 13
September 2017 respectively. The 1st monitoring was conducted after 4 weeks of adult releases.
However, for the egg releases in the Commercial Centre, the first monitoring was conducted
after 4 egg releases, after 8 weeks on 15 January 2018.

Two days prior to the initial releases of Wolbachia-carrying Ae. aegypti in each site, fogging to
suppress the wild populations was carried out using ultra low volume spray (ULV) of
pyrethroids or organophosphates, in accordance with the Standard Operative Procedures of the
Ministry of Health. During the trial release period, no fogging or space spraying activities were
conducted within the release sites. GIS maps of release sites were prepared in order to construct
release point grids, using the GIS software ArcGIS v10.5 and QGIS 3.2.3 Bonn. Release site
maps were sketched based on the topography and cadastral map provided by the Department of
Survey and Mapping Malaysia and with reference to Google Maps and 1MalaysiaMap
(http://1malaysiamap.mygeoportal.gov.my/).

Mosquitoes were transported to the field sites in a van kept at ambient temperature. At Mentari
Court, a total of 40,800 Wolbachia-carrying adult mosquitoes were released weekly in blocks
A to G including indoor parking areas. The mosquitoes were released on every third level in
each block at 4 release points, except for block G which had 6 release points. For the indoor
parking building, there were 4 release points on the ground floor and 2nd floor. Four paper cups
(diameter 8 cm, height 11 cm), each with 50 mosquitoes (mixed sex) were released. Following
each release 10 containers were brought back to the laboratory and survival of adults was
monitored; very little mortality (never > 5%) was observed. Releases were conducted for 20
weeks and terminated when the Wolbachia frequency reached >90% on 3 consecutive
monitoring periods. At the final monitoring period 98% were Wolbachia-carrying, as assessed
through ovitraps. At Section 7 Flats, 20,400 Wolbachia-carrying adults were released weekly
in blocks 1 to 51. There were 8 release points across 2 levels (ground floor and 2nd floor), with
1 cup per release point. Releases were initially conducted across 26 weeks when Wolbachia
frequencies exceeded >90% on 3 consecutive monitoring periods. Releases ceased for 4
months, and then a second release period was undertaken for 31 weeks at a lower rate (10,200).

At the Section 7 Commercial Centre, releases involved eggs rather than adults. Egg containers
(14.5 cm x 12.5 cm) contained 150 Wolbachia-carrying eggs in 400 mL of water with 180 mg
liver powder. A single release hole (2 cm) was covered with a stopper. Egg containers were

placed at a release point in the shade, on mailboxes or near staircases. Containers were left for
2 weeks. After 5 days, the stopper was removed to allow mosquitoes to emerge. Hatching rate
was assessed on 5 containers by placing them in a sealed container left in the field house. Adults
were counted (75-80% of the eggs produced adults).

Ovitraps were used to assess Wolbachia frequencies and to monitor numbers of Ae. aegypti and
Ae. albopictus. Each ovitrap consisted of a plastic container (96 mm height, 67 mm diameter)
with 150 mL water and a wooden paddle (2 cm x 7 cm). In Mentari Court, 100 ovitraps were
set up on the ground. In the apartment buildings, these were placed on the ground floor, the 2nd,
5th, 8th, 11th, 14th and 17th floors. For the car park building, the 1st floor and 3rd floors were
monitored. Ovitraps were collected after a week and the paddle+water was transferred to a
plastic container (12 x 12 cm). All emerging mosquitoes were identified to species and a
maximum of 10 Ae. aegypti per trap were used for Wolbachia screening.

In Section 7 Shah Alam, monitoring was done after 4 weeks from the first release using 183
ovitraps, with 3 ovitraps set up per block on the ground, 3rd and 5th floors. Initially, monitoring
in Mentari Court and Section 7 Shah Alam was conducted every two weeks and later every
month. In Section 7 Commercial Centre, 100 ovitraps were set on the ground, middle and top
floors as evenly as possible across the release zone. Monitoring was initiated after the 4th egg
release on a monthly basis.

Adults from ovitraps were stored in absolute ethanol at -80°C. DNA was extracted from
individual mosquitoes using the Chelex® 100 resin (Bio-Rad Laboratories) method.
Mosquitoes were homogenised in 175 µL of 5% Chelex® solution using TissueLyser II
machine (Qiagen) and with 5 µL of proteinase K (20 mg/mL) (Bioron Life Science). The
extraction was incubated in thermocycler at 65°C for 1 hour, followed by incubation for 10
minutes at 90°C16. Wolbachia was detected by high-resolution melting polymerase chain
reaction (qPCR-HRM) [27] with 1:10 diluted DNA using the following wAlbB1-specifc
primers: wAlbB1-F (5’-CCTTACCTCCTGCACAACAA) and wAlbB1-R (5’ –
GGATTGTCCAGTGGCCTTA), as well as universal mosquito primers: mRpS6_F (5’AGTTGAACGTATCGTTTCCCGCTAC)
and
mRpS6_R
(5’GAAGTGACGCAGCTTGTGGTCGTCC), which target the conserved region of the RpS6
gene, and Ae. aegypti primers aRpS6-F (5’-ATCAAGAAGCGCCGTGTCG) and aRpS6-R (5’CAGGTGCAGGATCTTCATGTATTCG), which target the Ae. aegypti-specific
polymorphisms within RpS6 and do not amplify Ae. albopictus.

Reactions were run as 384-well plates in a LightCycler 480 II (Roche). qPCR-HRM was
performed in 10 µL reactions containing 2 µL of DNA, 0.08 µL of 50 µM forward+reverse
primer, 2.92 µL Milli-Q water and 5 µL Ronald’s Real-Time Buffer (3.28 µL Milli-Q water,
0.4 µL MgCl2 (50 mM), 1.0 µL ThermoPol Reaction Buffer with 20 mM Magnesium (10x),
0.25 µL HRM Master (Roche), 0.064 µL dNTPs (25 mM) and 0.01 µL Immolase™ (20 U/µL).
qPCR was run following cycling conditions: 95°C for 10 min, followed by 50 cycles of 95°C
for 10 seconds, 58°C for 15 seconds, 72 °C for 15 seconds. High resolution melting was
performed by heating the PCR product to 95°C, and then cooling to 40°C. Then the temperature
was increased to 65°C. Samples were considered positive for Wolbachia when the Tm for the
amplicon produced by the Ae. aegypti primers was at least 84°C and the Tm for the Wolbachiaprimer amplicon was around 80°C.

Dengue control activities

In Mentari Court, many different control activities and education programmes have been
carried out to suppress dengue. Fig. 5 shows that various activities such as source reduction,
thermal fogging and Ultra Low Volume space spraying were conducted. Despite this activity,
dengue cases remained high in this site. After the introduction of Wolbachia, there was a
decrease in other activities undertaken to suppress dengue following a decrease in cases.

Therefore, community engagement around Wolbachia decreased rather than increased other
control activities at this site. At the other release sites, there was no increase in non-Wolbachia
dengue suppression activities following the initiation of releases.

Matched control sites were selected based on similarity of constituent buildings (at least 7
blocks of 12-20 floors for Mentari Court controls, at least 35 blocks of 4-7 floors for Shah Alam
Flat controls, at least 15 blocks of 5-7 floors for Commercial Centre controls); and comparable
dengue incidence between 2013 and the start of intervention periods. Notified dengue cases in
release and control sites were recorded daily from local clinics and hospitals. All notified cases
were confirmed using NS1 and IgM/IgG Combo Rapid Test Kits (RVR Diagnostics Sdn. Bhd.,
Subang Jaya, Malaysia) according to manufacturer’s protocols, based on the established
Malaysian Dengue Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG), available on http://www.moh.gov.my.

All notified dengue cases are recorded into the National e-dengue database at the District
Health Office. Dengue cases in the population residing at the study sites were detected via this
National Dengue Surveillance System. All cases were diagnosed using the National case
definition guidelines (Case Definitions for Infectious Diseases in Malaysia 2017). A confirmed
case of dengue was defined as fulfilling the clinical criteria for dengue infection with the
following laboratory confirmation: detection of Dengue Non-Structural Protein 1 (NS1) from
serum; and, detection of dengue IgM and /or IgG from a single serum sample. While there are
limitations to all laboratory diagnostic tests for dengue, the dengue rapid test kits (RTK)
applied in this National Surveillance System represent the most cost-effective point of care
diagnostic testing at a population level. The standardized diagnostic criteria applied through
this system ensures no biases in test results between the intervention and control sites.

436

Bayesian time series model

437
438

A Bayesian time series model was used to estimate the reduction in dengue cases resulting from
releases. The model structure was as follows:

439
440

𝑦𝑖,𝑡 ∼ 𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝜆𝑖,𝑡 𝑁𝑖 )
𝑙𝑛(𝜆𝑖,𝑡 ) = 𝛼𝑖 + 𝛾𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛽𝑥𝑖

441

𝛾𝑖,𝑡 = 𝜌 𝛾𝑖,𝑡−1 + 𝜖𝑖,𝑡 ; 𝛾𝑖,0 = 0

𝑟 ∼ 𝑁 + (0, 100); 𝜖𝑖,𝑡 ∼ 𝑁(0, 𝜎 2 ); 𝜌 ∼ 𝑈(−1, 1); 𝜎 ∼ 𝑁 + (0, 100); 𝛼𝑖 ∼ 𝑁(0, 100)
where the number of cases 𝑦 at each site 𝑖 and week 𝑡 were assumed to follow a Poisson
distribution, with the expected count given by the product of population at that site, and the percapita incidence which varied varying through time and between sites. Each site had a separate
time series of log-incidences 𝛼𝑖 + 𝛾𝑖,𝑡 with temporal correlation driven by an autoregressive
model of order one, with parameters 𝜌 and 𝜎 2 shared by all sites. Each observation therefore
had a separate (temporally-correlated) random effect on the log scale, to account for extraPoisson dispersion and temporal correlation. The intervention effect was represented by a
parameter 𝛽 and an indicator variable 𝑥𝑖 for whether the observation was post-release at a
release site. Model parameters were assigned vague normal; positive-truncated normal; or
uniform priors. The model was used both to estimate the impact of the releases, and to assess
the evidence from the dengue case data that releases lead to a reduction in incidence - quantified
as the posterior probability that 𝛽 is negative, in the absence of prior knowledge about the
direction of the effect.

456
457
458
459

Posterior samples of model parameters were simulated by Hamiltonian Monte Carlo in greta
[29] with 4 chains, each yielding 4000 posterior samples of model parameters after a warmup
period of 1000 iterations during which period the leapfrog step size and diagonal mass matrix
parameters were tuned. The number of leapfrog steps was sampled uniformly from between 30

and 40 throughout. Convergence was assessed by the Gelman-Rubin 𝑅̂ diagnostic, using the
coda R package [30] (𝑅̂ ≤ 1.01 for all parameters) and visual assessment of trace plots. Model
fit was assessed by posterior predictive simulation: a random dataset of 𝑦𝑖,𝑡 values was
generated according to each posterior sample of 𝑝𝑖,𝑡 and 𝑟, and the distributions of the simulated
𝑦𝑖,𝑡 values were compared with the observed 𝑦𝑖,𝑡 . The analysis code is freely available online
(code attached with submission and archive URL to be provided here on acceptance).
