Abstract

21

Models of host-microbe dynamics typically assume a single-host population infected by a single

22

pathogen. In reality, many hosts form multi-species aggregations and may be infected with an

23

assemblage of pathogens. We used a meta-transcriptomic approach to characterize the viromes of

24

nine avian species in the Anseriformes (ducks) and Charadriiformes (shorebirds). This revealed the

25

presence of 27 viral species, of which 24 were novel, including double-stranded RNA viruses

26

(Picobirnaviridae and Reoviridae), single-stranded RNA viruses (Astroviridae, Caliciviridae,

27

Picornaviridae), a retro-transcribing DNA virus (Hepadnaviridae), and a single-stranded DNA virus

28

(Parvoviridae). These viruses comprise multi-host generalist viruses and those that are host-specific,

29

indicative of both virome connectivity and heterogeneity. Virome connectivity was apparent in two

30

well described multi-host virus species (avian coronavirus and influenza A virus) and a novel

31

Rotavirus species that were shared among some Anseriform species, while heterogeneity was

32

reflected in the absence of viruses shared between Anseriformes and Charadriiformes. Notably,

33

within avian host families there was no significant relationship between either host taxonomy or

34

foraging ecology and virome composition, although Anseriform species positive for influenza A

35

virus harboured more additional viruses than those negative for influenza virus. Overall, we

36

demonstrate complex virome structures across host species that co-exist in multi-species

37

aggregations.

Introduction

43

Many hosts are members of multi-species aggregations and may be infected by an assemblage of

44

specialist and/or multi-host generalist infectious agents. Host community diversity is central to

45

pathogen dynamics (1, 2), and pathogen species richness, relative abundance, specificity and intra-

46

and inter-species interactions within assemblages likely have complex roles in modulating pathogen

47

levels within populations (1, 3-8). A significant limitation in studying viral communities in hosts is

48

that most viral species remained undescribed (9), such that viral ecology across multi-host systems

49

has been limited to “single-virus” dynamics, particularly in vertebrate systems (for example,

50

Influenza A virus [IAV] in avian populations). With the advent of unbiased, bulk 'meta-

51

transcriptomic’ RNA sequencing we can now explore, in more detail, how viral community structure

52

may be shaped by host-species interactions.

53

Birds of the orders Anseriformes and Charadriiformes, the central reservoirs for avian viruses such

54

as IAV, avian avulavirus and avian coronavirus (10, 11), form multi-host flocks, in which many

55

species may migrate, forage, or roost together (e.g. (12). These flocks may comprise species along a

56

taxonomically related gradient and may utilize similar or different ecological niches in the same

57

environment. For example, in Australia, taxonomically related dabbling Grey Teals (Anas gracilis)

58

and Pacific Black Ducks (Anas superciliosa) may share the environment with the distantly related

59

filter feeding Pink-eared Duck (Malacorhynchus membranaceus). These multi-host flocks form

60

multi-host maintenance communities (6), with consequences for virus ecology, transmission, and

61

virulence (1, 13, 14).

62

Studies of the ecology of IAV, the best studied multi-host virus in wild birds, have shown that not all

63

hosts are equal (15, 16). In particular, there are marked differences in susceptibility, pathology and

64

the subsequent immune response in taxonomically related species, or distantly related species within

65

similar ecological niches. For example, dramatic differences in viral prevalence exist within the

66

Charadriiformes, such that Ruddy Turnstones (Arenaria interpres) may have an IAV prevalence of

67

~15%, compared to the negligible IAV prevalence in co-sampled Sanderlings (Calidris alba)

68

sampled at Delaware Bay, USA (17). There are also major differences in the pathology of highly

69

pathogenic IAV in Anseriformes both in the field and in experimental infections. Mallards (Anas

70

platyrhynchos) infected with the highly pathogenic IAV are thought to move the virus large distances

71

and remain free of clinical signs, while Tufted Ducks (Aythya fuligula), in contrast, experience

72

severe mortality (18-20). Following IAV infection, dabbling ducks of the genus Anas are believed to

73

develop poor immune memory (21), allowing IAV re-infections throughout their lives, in contrast to

74

swans that have long term immune memory (22) and where re-infection probability is likely very

75

low in adults. These differences are driven by factors encompassing both virus (e.g. virulence,

76

transmission) and host (e.g. receptor availability, immune responses) biology (11).

77

The goal of this study was to use the analysis of comparative virome structures, particularly virome

78

composition, diversity and abundance, as a means to describe the nature of host-virus interactions

79

beyond the “one-host, one-virus” model. Given their role as hosts for multi-host viruses such as IAV,

80

coronaviruses and avian avulaviruses, we used apparently healthy members of the Anseriformes and

81

Charadriiformes as model avian taxa in these comparisons. In particular, we aimed to (i) reveal the

82

viromes and describe novel viruses in the bird taxa sampled, (ii) determine whether viromes of

83

different host orders have different abundance and viral diversity such that they cluster separately,

84

(iii) determine whether closely taxonomically related and co-occuring avian hosts have viromes that

85

are more homogenous, and (iv) identify the impact of host taxonomy, which we use as a proxy for

86

differences in relevant host traits (such as host physiology, cell receptors), in determining virome

87

structure. Overall, we reveal a combination of virome heterogeneity and connectivity across avian

88

species that are important reservoirs of avian viruses.

103

A combination or oropharyngeal and cloacal samples were collected using a sterile-tipped swab and

104

were placed in viral transport media (VTM, Brain-heart infusion broth containing 2x106 122 U/l

105

penicillin, 0.2 mg/ml streptomycin, 0.5 mg/ml gentamicin, 500 U/ml amphotericin B, Sigma).

106

RNA virus discovery

107

RNA was extracted and libraries constructed as per (25) (Table S1). Paired end sequencing (100bp)

108

of the RNA library was performed on an Illumina platform at the Australian Genome Research

109

Facility (AGRF, Melbourne). Similarly, sequence reads were demultiplexed and contigs assembled

110

and contig abundance calculated as per (25).

111

All contigs that returned blast hits with paired abundance estimates were filtered to remove plants

112

and invertebrate reads that likely correspond to the host diet, as well as fungal, bacterial and host

113

sequences. The virus list was further filtered to remove viruses with likely invertebrate (26), lower

114

vertebrate (27), plant or bacterial host associations using the Virus-Host database

115

(http://www.genome.jp/virushostdb/) such that only those viruses that grouped within the previously

116

defined vertebrate virus groups are identified as bird associated.

117

Virus genome annotation and phylogenetic analysis

118

Contigs were annotated, and phylogenetic treesinferred as per (25). Briefly, contigs greater than

119

1000bp in length were inspected using Geneious R10 (Biomatters, New Zealand), and open reading

120

frame corresponding to predicted genome architectures based on the closest reference genomes were

121

interrogated. Reads were subsequently mapped back to viral contigs to identify mis-assembly using

122

bowtie2 (28). Viruses with full length genomes, or incomplete genomes but that possess the full-

123

length RNA-dependant RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, were used for phylogenetic analysis. Briefly,

124

sequences of the polyprotein or gene encoding for the RdRp were aligned using MAFFT (29), and

125

gaps and ambiguously aligned regions were stripped using trimAL (30). Final alignment lengths for

126

each data set are presented in Table S2. The most appropriate amino acid substitution model was

127

then determined for each data set, and maximum likelihood trees were estimated using PhyML 3.0

128

(31) with 1000 bootstrap replicates. Novel viral species were identified as those that had <90% RdRp

129

protein identity, or <80% genome identity to previously described viruses. All reads have been

130

deposited in the Short Read Archive (PRJNA505206) and viral sequences described have been

131

deposited in GenBank (MK204384-MK20441, MK213322-MK213337).

133

Relative virus abundance was estimated as the proportion of the total viral reads in each library

134

(excluding rRNA). All ecological measures were calculated using the data set comprising viruses

135

associated with “higher” vertebrates (i.e. birds and mammals), albeit with all retroviruses and

136

retrotransposons removed (hereafter, “avian virus data set”).

137

Analyses were performed using R v 3.4.0 integrated into RStudio v 1.0.143, and plotted using

138

ggplot2. Both the observed virome richness and Shannon effective (i.e. alpha diversity) were

139

calculated for each library at the virus family and genus levels using the Rhea script sets (32), and

140

compared between avian orders using the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test. Beta diversity was

141

calculated using the Bray Curtis dissimilarity matrix and virome structure was plotted as a function

142

of nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination and tested using Adonis tests using the

143

vegan (33) and phyloseq packages (34). To determine whether differences in virome composition can

144

be explained by host phylogeny (35), dendograms of beta diversity were constructed using the bray

145

curtis dissimilarity matrix using the vegan package incorporated into the hclust() function.

146

Dendograms representing library abundance and composition at the viral family, genera and species

147

level of taxonomy were also compared to the host phylogeny. For the species level comparison, we

148

used only those presented in Table S3. Two phylogenetic tree congruence metrics were then

149

calculated to compare the match between the virome metric and host phylogeny: the matching cluster

150

Robinson-Foulds tree metric (36) was calculated using the phangorn package (37), and the

151

normalized PH85 metric (38) (39) was determined using the ape package (40). For both metrics, a

152

distance of 0 indicates complete congruence and 1, incomplete congruence. The phylogenetic

153

relationships among the avian host species were inferred using a maximum likelihood tree of the

154

cytochrome B mitochondrial sequences and accords with those determined previously (41-44). The

155

overall co-phylogenetic analysis was visualized using the phytools package (45).

156

Finally, the relative abundance of virus families between each avian host order (Charadriiformes

157

versus Anseriformes) was assessed using the wilcox test. Subsequently, log2 relative abundance was

158

calculated using DESeq2 (46) implemented in phyloseq (34). Given the large number of genera

159

detected within the Picornaviridae, this analysis was repeated at the viral genus level in this case.

163

We characterized the total transcriptome of nine avian species from the Anseriformes and

164

Charadriiformes (Table S1). Within each avian order, bird species were sampled across the same

165

spatial and temporal scales, although members of the Anseriformes and Charadriiformes were

166

sampled at different time points (i.e. years) and locations. This resulted in two bird communities

167

comprising five and four species, respectively (Table S1). RNA sequencing of rRNA depleted

168

libraries resulted in an average of 50,906,440 reads (range 44,178,936-64,149,180) assembled into a

169

mean of 27,108 contigs (range 22,175-496,319) (Table S1). There was no significant correlation

170

between RNA concentration and the number of reads, contigs or abundance demonstrating such that

171

this was not a source of bias (Fig S1). There was a large range in total viral abundance (0.14-10.67%

172

viral reads) and putative avian viral abundance (0.00083-0.327% viral reads) in each library (Table

173

S1, Fig 1). In additional to avian viral reads, libraries had numerous reads matching arthropod

174

viruses and retroviruses (Fig 1). Although these retroviruses are likely bird associated, the challenge

175

of differentiating between endogenous and exogenous retroviruses meant that they were excluded

176

from the analysis, as were those viruses most likely associated with arthropods, plants and bacteria.

177

A total of 24 of the 27 viruses identified in this study likely represent novel avian viral species (Table

178

S3, Fig 2, Fig S2). Novel species were identified in the double-stranded RNA viruses

179

(Picobirnaviridae and Reoviridae, genus Rotavirus), positive-sense single-stranded (ss) RNA viruses

180

(Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae genus Megrivirus, Gallivirus, and unassigned genera),

181

and both retro-transcribing (Avihepadnaviridae) and single-stranded DNA viruses (Parvoviridae).

182

Novel ssRNA viruses. Two novel avastroviruses were identified. Red-necked Stint avastrovirus

183

likely comprises a new virus “Group” as it falls basal to the Group 1 and 2 viruses in our

184

phylogenetic analysis (Fig S3). Although no full genome Group 3 viruses exist, phylogenetic

185

analysis of a short region of the RdRp demonstrated that this virus does not belong to Group 3

186

avastroviruses (Fig S4). Analysis of this short RdRp region also suggested that Red-necked Stint

187

avastrovirus is sister to a virus detected in Swedish Mallards, indicating that this new group may be

188

globally distributed (Fig S4). A Group 1 Avastrovirus, Pink-eared Duck astrovirus was also

189

identified, and was a sister to Turkey astrovirus 2 (Fig S3, S4).

190

Our study further expanded an unassigned avian specific genus of the Caliciviridae with the

191

identification of three new species, two from Pink-eared Ducks and one from Grey Teal. These

192

viruses form a clade comprising Goose calicivirus, Turkey calicivirus and a calicivirus previously

193

identified in Red-necked Avocets from Australia (Recurvirostra novaehollandiae) (Fig 3).

194

Members of the Picornaviridae were commonplace and genomes or partial genomes were identified

195

in almost every library sequenced (Fig 4, Fig S5). Further, two different species of Picornaviruses

196

were detected in the Red-necked Stint (Red-necked Stint Gallivirus and Red-necked Stint

197

Picornavirus B-like) and Pink-eared Duck (Pink-eared Duck Megrivirus and Pink-eared Duck

198

Picornavirus) libraries. To date, Galliviruses have only been isolated from Galliformes, so it was

199

unexpected to identify a virus that was sister to this genus in the Red-necked Stint, although long

200

branch lengths involved may indicate a novel viral genus. A virus similar to Avian sapeloviruses was

201

identified in an Australian Shelduck (Fig 4, Fig S5). Three different Megriviruses were also

202

identified, two from Anseriformes and one from Charadriiformes. Finally, a number of

203

picornaviruses from unassigned genera similar to Pigeon picornavirus B were identified in

204

Charadriiformes (Fig 4, Fig S5). These form a clade with a number of picornaviruses previously

205

detected in Red-necked Avocets from Australia. Two host libraries had more than one picornavirus

206

species (Red-necked Stint and Pink-eared Duck) (Fig 2).

207

In addition to a previously described coronavirus, we identified a potentially novel species of

208

deltacoronavirus. Specifically, sharp-tailed Sandpiper deltacoronavirus was most closely related to

209

deltaviruses in wild birds from the United Arab Emirates and gulls from Europe (Fig S11), although

210

the limited number of deltacoronaviruses sequences available inhibits a detailed analysis of its

211

geographic range.

212

Novel dsRNA viruses. Three picobirnavirus species from two waterfowl species were newly

213

identified here. Grey Teal picobirnavirus X and Pink-eared Duck picobirnavirus are members of a

214

broad clade closely related to picobirnaviruses sampled in a number of species including Turkeys

215

(from which only very short sequences are available and hence not analysed here (Fig 5). Grey Teal

216

picobirnavirus Y falls into a divergent clade largely comprised of human and porcine

217

picobirnaviruses (and no turkey picobirnaviruses), potentially representing an interesting host-

218

switching event (Fig 5). However, due to limited sampling in wild birds, this virus could be related to

219

other, currently unsampled, avian picorbirnaviruses. Two novel rotavirus species were also revealed

220

from these host species. Indeed, Grey Teals and Pink-eared ducks shared a rotavirus species,

221

distantly related to rotavirus G. This virus is one of three shared viruses in our entire dataset. Grey

222

Teals also carried a second rotavirus species, distantly related to rotavirus F (Fig S7).

223

Novel DNA viruses. These data also provided evidence for the presence of a novel single-stranded

224

DNA virus and retro-transcribing DNA virus. An Australian Shelduck parvovirus (ssDNA) was

225

revealed in the Grey Teal (Grey Teal Parvovirus) that belongs to the highly divergent genus

226

Chapparvovirus of the Parvoviridae (Fig 6). Exogenous hepadnaviruses (retro-transcribing DNA

227

viruses) from waterfowl are host specific, and the novel Wood Duck Hepatitis B virus identified here

228

is most closely related to Shelgoose Hepatitis B virus, Duck Hepatitis B virus and Snow Goose

229

Hepatitis Virus (Fig S8).

230

Previously described avian RNA viruses

231

Given their frequency in avian populations as described in numerous surveillance schemes, we

232

anticipated finding IAV, Avian avulavirus type 1 (formerly avian paramyxovirus type 1), and

233

members of the Coronaviridae in some of the species sampled. Not only did we detect these viruses,

234

but IAV and avian gammacoronavirus were shared across three different waterfowl libraries (Fig S9-

235

S10). Phylogenetic analysis of a partial RdRp revealed that the avian gammacoronavirus identified

236

here were most closely related to those already found in Australian wild birds (Fig S10).

237

We identified two subtypes of influenza A virus – H9N1 and H3N1 (Fig S12, S13) – in Grey Teal

238

and Pink-eared Duck, respectively. Both H9N1 and H3N1 are rarely detected subtype combinations

239

in large waterfowl surveillance schemes (47, 48). Segments of these two viruses generally fell into

240

the geographically isolated “Eurasian” clade, with the exception of the NP segment that fell within

241

the “North American” clade, thereby demonstrating intercontinental reassortment in Australian

242

waterfowl viruses (Fig S12, S13). Finally, although avian avulavirus Type 1 Class II Genotype 1b

243

are frequently isolated from wild birds globally, we detected a Class II Genotype 1a virus

244

infrequently isolated in wild birds (Fig S14). This genotype has been previously isolated from

245

Australian chickens, although the F gene cleavage site (GRQGR*L) indicates this virus is of the low

246

pathogenic phenotype.

247

Host heterogeneity and connectivity of avian viromes

248

There was a large variation in the abundance of avian viral reads across the libraries. The highest

249

abundance of avian viruses was in Red-necked Stint and Sharp-tailed Sandpiper, with 0.08% of reads

250

in both cases; the lowest viral abundance was also in this avian order (Curlew Sandpiper, 0.00018%

251

of reads). Of the Anseriformes, Grey Teal, Australian Shelduck and Pink-eared Duck had high

252

abundance (0.051%, 0.035%, and 0.047% of reads, respectively) while Wood Duck and Pacific

253

Black Duck had very low abundance, albeit only one order of magnitude lower (0.0024% and

254

0.0019%, respectively) (Table S1).

255

As with abundance, there was marked heterogeneity in alpha diversity (i.e. the diversity of viruses in

256

each library) within the Anseriformes and Charadriiformes. In contrast to abundance, alpha diversity

257

was higher in Anseriform than Charadriiform libraries at the viral family, genus, and species levels,

258

although this difference was not statistically significant (Fig S15-S17). The lack of significance is

259

potentially due to the surprisingly high alpha diversity in Red-necked Stint compared to other

260

Charadriiformes, and the low alpha diversity in Pacific Black Ducks and Australian Wood Ducks in

261

the Anseriformes (Fig 7A, Fig S15-S18). Hence, despite sampling multispecies flocks, there can be a

262

large variation in virome structure across species and potentially individuals.

263

There was also substantial variation in the viral genera and species composition within each library

264

(Fig 7A, Fig S15-S18). Members of the Picornaviridae, Caliciviridae and Reoviridae (genus

265

Rotavirus) were ubiquitous and full genomes or short contigs were found in almost every library,

266

often at high abundance (Fig 7A, Fig S14, S16). In addition to picornaviruses and rotaviruses, the

267

Red-necked Stint had a highly abundant astrovirus (0.012%) and avulavirus (0.035%), while Sharp-

268

tailed Sandpipers had a highly abundant deltacoronavirus (0.073%) that were not detected in other

269

Charadriiform libraries (Fig 7A, S17). More viral families, genera and species were shared amongst

270

the Anseriformes, particularly between Grey Teal, Pink-eared Duck and Australian Shelduck.

271

Specifically, Grey Teal and Australian Shelduck shed avian gammacoronavirus at high abundance

272

(0.021% and 0.029%, respectively) and Grey Teal and Pink-eared Duck shed IAV, although at lower

273

abundances (0.0041% and 0.000728%, respectively) (Fig 7A, Fig S17). Overall, there were no

274

significant trends towards differential abundance of viral families between the Charadriiformes and

275

Anseriformes (Fig S19-S21). Viruses from the Astroviridae, Calciviridae, Coronaviridae,

276

Picobirnaviridae, Picornaviridae, Reoviridae and Rhabdoviridae were found in both Anseriformes

277

and Charadriiformes, albeit with different abundance patterns (Fig S19-S21). Multiple genera of

278

picornaviruses were detected, but similarly without significant differences: most families and genera

279

were detected in both avian orders (Fig S19-S21).

280

Using a non-metric ordination method (NMDS) we found no clustering of viral family or viral genus

281

by host order with respect to virus abundance and diversity between libraries (i.e. beta-diversity) (Fig

282

S22). Similarly, there was no statistically significant clustering of viral families (R2 = 0.13, df = 8, p

283

= 0.267) or genera (R2 = 0.157, df = 8, p = 0.173) in the Charadriiformes compared to Anseriformes,

284

suggesting that despite taxonomic differences waterbirds share numerous viral genera and families.

285

We utilized a co-phylogenetic approach to better determine whether this lack of clustering was

286

associated with host phylogeny. Accordingly, a phylogram of beta-diversity was not congruent with

287

host phylogeny at the viral family, genus or species levels (Fig 7B, Fig S23-S24). Hence,

288

evolutionary relationships among hosts may not play a major role in structuring viromes. For

289

example, closely related sister species (the Anas ducks Grey Teal and Pacific Black Ducks, or

290

Calidris sandpipers Sharp-tailed Sandpipers, Red-necked Stint and Curlew Sandpipers) do not

291

possess viromes that are more similar to each other than to those of more distantly related species

292

within the same avian order. Rather, the phylogram of beta diversity has clusters with a mix of

293

Anseriform and Charadriiform libraries, indicating connectivity of viral families and genera across

294

species of both avian orders (Fig 7B, Fig S23-S24). Similarly, there was also no statistically

295

significant clustering by feeding mechanism in the Anseriformes (R2=0.56, df=4, p=0.2) or

296

migratory propensity in the Charadriiformes (R2=0.43, df=3, p=0.25) (Fig S22) suggesting that host

297

ecology may also play a limited role in shaping virome composition at the levels of viral family and

298

genus.

299

Assessing comparative virome structure at the viral family and genera level is critical in

300

demonstrating core viral families and genera in waterbirds. Species level analysis, albeit limited to

301

viruses in which we were able to assemble >1000bp, is a more accurate measure of connectivity and

302

heterogeneity of avian viromes. First, while there was no marked division in virome composition at

303

the level of viral family or genera between the Anseriformes and the Charadriiformes, there was such

304

a distinction at the level of viral species. Specifically, no viral species were shared between the

305

Anseriformes and Charadriiformes (Fig 3), although the Anseriformes and Charadriiformes were

306

sampled at different time points and at different locations. Within the Anseriformes, three viruses

307

(influenza A virus, avian gammacoronavirus, and duck rotavirus G-like) were shared between three

308

libraries: Grey Teal, Pink-eared Duck and Australian Shelduck (Fig 3, Fig S23). These shared

309

viruses were especially common in the viromes of the Grey Teal (80% of avian viral reads),

310

Australian Shelduck (82% of avian viral reads), and a small proportion of Pink-eared Duck avian

311

viral reads (17%). The two Anas ducks (Grey Teal and Pacific Black Duck), the most closely related

312

Anseriformes, did not share any viral species; surprisingly, the virome of the Pacific-Black Duck was

313

different from the three connected host species. Further, Grey Teal and Pink-eared Ducks, the most

314

taxonomically distinct waterfowl, shared two viral species, demonstrating the limited impact of host

315

phylogeny (Fig S23). These viruses were also shared across ecological niches (dabbling ducks and

316

filter feeding ducks), suggesting that co-occurrence was potentially responsible for their spread.

317

Within the Anseriformes we tested for the effect of virus-virus interactions on alpha diversity,

318

specifically whether the presence of IAV had an effect on virome abundance or composition. Despite

319

a low abundance of IAV in the libraries, there was a trend towards a higher alpha diversity of

320

viromes in Anseriform species positive for IAV (Grey Teal, Pink-eared Duck; Fig S25) at the viral

321

family, genus and species levels, although this was not statistically significant due to small sample

322

size. Furthermore, IAV positive libraries were adjacent to each on the NMDS plots, although this

323

clustering was not statistically significant (Viral Family R2=0.14, df=8, p=0.307, Viral Genera,

324

R2=0.14, df=8, p=0.224). This trend did not hold for avian gammacoronavirus in the Grey Teal and

325

Australian Shelduck libraries (Fig S26).

326

Finally, the phylogenetic analysis did not reveal a clear host-taxonomic gradient in viral species

327

relationships. However, within the megriviruses (Picornaviridae), there appear to be large clades that

328

may reflect avian order, with the viruses identified in the Anseriformes and Charadriiformes falling

329

into two different clades. Furthermore, viruses from wild Anseriformes fall as sister taxa to

330

previously described duck and goose megriviruses (Fig S6). In addition, this and our previous study

331

(25) identified a number of picornaviruses from an unassigned genus only found in Charadriiformes,

332

such that it might similarly represent a virus genus that is specific to a particular host order.

333
334

Discussion

335

We identified 27 novel and previously described viral species from nine waterbirds falling into two

336

avian orders. Anseriformes and Charadriiformes are important reservoirs for the best described avian

337

virus, IAV, but are also central to the epidemiology of other multi-host viruses such as avian

338

coronavirus and avian avulavirus type 1 (10, 11, 24, 49-53). As such, these avian hosts are excellent

339

model species for understanding the determinants of virome composition. Indeed, we detected all

340

these previously described low pathogenic avian viruses in our sample set, and coronaviruses and

341

influenza A viruses were shared across different Anseriform species. We also genomically described

342

24 novel viral species belonging to 10 viral families, including both RNA and DNA viruses. The

343

largest number and diversity of viruses belonged to the Picornaviridae, although a number of

344

rotaviruses and caliciviruses were also described.

345

Overall, the avian viruses identified in this study were most closely related to other avian viruses, or

346

in genera containing avian viruses. The exception is Grey Teal picorbirnavirus Y that occupies a

347

clade dominated by viruses from human and porcine hosts. Whether this represents a host switch, or

348

is due to lack of sampling in other hosts, will likely be revealed in additional metatranscriptomic

349

studies. The Shelduck parvovirus described here is of particular interest as it is a member of the

350

genus Chapparvovirus. Metagenomic analyses have recently identified members of this genus in a

351

large number of vertebrates (54), and are known agents of severe disease (55).

352

Beyond viral discovery, our study revealed no predictable clustering of viromes according to host

353

taxonomy in either the Anseriformes and/or Charadriiformes. Given the data on IAV, we might

354

expect see differences in virome structure due to a number of host factors (11), including differences

355

in biology/physiology. For example, different host species have different cell receptors which in turn

356

results in different cell and tissue tropisms and patterns of viral attachment (56). Further, following

357

infection, different species have differences in long-term immune memory (21, 22). However, we

358

saw no clear distinction between the viromes of Anseriformes or Charadriiformes based on host

359

taxonomy, suggesting these host factors are not central to virome structuring. For example, within

360

the Charadriiformes, the closely related Calidris sandpipers (Scolopacidae) did not have similar

361

viromes and did not cluster as a group independently from Red-capped Plover, a member of a

362

different avian family (Charadridae). Alternatively, it is possible that aspects of host ecology, such as

363

foraging ecology, may be more important in shaping virome composition than host taxonomy (a

364

proxy for physiology). Specifically, differences in ecology may generate differences in virus

365

exposure across closely related hosts (11, 57, 58). The five Anseriform species studied here utilize

366

three different feeding ecologies - dabbling, grazing and filter feeding - while the four Charadriiform

367

species have different bill lengths and forage in different layers of sediment (12). Notably, however,

368

there was no clear difference in virome composition as a result of ecology.

369

Central to our study was considering virome structure in the context of a multi-host and multi-virus

370

model of virus-host interactions. Accordingly, the data generated here revealed large-scale

371

heterogeneity (abundance and alpha diversity) in virome composition at the levels of virus family,

372

genus and even species. Despite this heterogeneity, there was also some connectivity between

373

viromes at the levels of virus family, genus and even species: some viral families and genera were

374

ubiquitous in almost all avian libraries, including members of the Picornaviridae and Reoviridae.

375

More striking was the connectivity between three avian species (Grey Teal, Australian Shelduck, and

376

Pink-eared Duck) at the level of viral species: these hosts shared Influenza A virus,

377

gammacoronavirus, and Duck G-like rotavirus. As these Anseriformes were sampled in the same

378

temporal and spatial frames, it is not unexpected that there was connectivity despite differences in

379

ecology and taxonomy. However, at the level of viral species there was no connectivity between the

380

Anseriform and Charadriiform libraries, although this may be due to the physiological differences

381

noted above or, more simply, that the ducks and wader viruses were sampled at different times and

382

places. Despite the lack of connectivity between the Anseriformes and Charadriiformes at a viral

383

species level, avian avulavirus 1 and deltacoronavirus detected in Red-necked Stint and Sharp-tailed

384

Sandpiper, respectively, have been previously described in Anseriformes (10, 51). This connectivity

385

between viromes is likely facilitated by the association of these birds to water. Specifically, viruses

386

such as IAV are thought to be primarily transmitted by the faecal-oral route, in which viruses
13

387

contaminate water through the faeces and birds ingest the viruses while feeding or preening (15).

388

Such water-borne transmission is critical to the dynamics of infection in bird communities (59).

389

Furthermore, aquatic habitats seemingly support a higher risk of infection as compared to terrestrial

390

habitats (58, 60). In support of this was the observation of lower viral diversity and abundance in the

391

grazing Australian Wood duck which has a more terrestrial dietary strategy compared to the other

392

Anseriform species.

393

In sum, viral families and genera appeared to be readily shared among hosts, suggesting that

394

waterbirds are key hosts for these families and genera. More importantly, our results indicate that

395

avian viromes are largely comprised of what appear to be multi-host generalist viruses (here,

396

influenza A virus, avian coronavirus, avian avulavirus type 1, duck rotavirus D-like) along with

397

potential host-specific specialist viruses, which likely play a role in driving both heterogeneity and

398

connectivity. While we found no evidence for viral species shared across avian orders, known multi-

399

host virus species were revealed in both avian orders. Cases of clear host specificity were rare, but

400

we speculate that Wood Duck Hepatitis B virus is likely host specific given high host specificity in

401

this viral family (61). In addition, the clade level structuring of Megriviruses (Picornaviridae), and

402

previous report of an identical Megrivirus species found in the same avian species in very different

403

locations (25), similarly suggests some level of host specificity in this viral genus. Viral discovery

404

efforts are imperative to better understanding factors that shape virome structure and the scope of

405

host specificity in the avian reservoir. Importantly, we believe it is also imperative to consider multi-

406

host, multi-virus systems in virus ecology.

Figure 2. Bipartite network illustrating the species for which complete viral genomes were found in

11

each library. Each library is represented as a central node, with a pictogram of the avian species,

12

surrounded by each viral species. Where no complete viral genomes were revealed, the pictogram is

13

shown with no viruses. Where two libraries share a virus species the networks between the two

14

libraries are linked. Virus colour corresponds to virus taxonomy. A list of viruses from each library is

15

presented in Table S3, and phylogenetic trees for each virus family and species can be found in (Fig

diversity metrics are presented in Fig S17. (B) Co-phylogeny demonstrating the discordance between

46

host taxonomic relationship and virome composition. Host (phylogenetic) taxonomic relationship

47

was inferred using the mitochondrial cytochrome B gene. Virome composition dendogram generated

48

by clustering of bray-curtis dissimilarity matrix. The relationship between host taxonomy and virome

49

composition was tested using two discordance metrics: Robinson-Foulds and nPH85, where 1 is

50

discordance and 0 is agreement.
