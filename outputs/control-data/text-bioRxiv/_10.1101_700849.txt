Abstract
Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) have emerged as a
powerful platform for in vitro modelling of cardiac diseases, safety pharmacology, and drug screening.
All these applications require large quantities of well-characterised and standardised batches of hiPSCCMs. Cryopreservation of hiPSC-CMs without affecting their biochemical or biophysical phenotype is
essential for facilitating this, but ideally requires the cells being unchanged by the freeze-thaw
procedure. We therefore compared the in vitro functional and molecular characteristics of fresh and
cryopreserved hiPSC-CMs generated from two independent hiPSC lines. While the frozen hiPSC-CMs
exhibited poorer replating than their freshly-derived counterparts, there was no difference in the
proportion of cardiomyocytes retrieved from the mixed population when this was factored in.
Interestingly, cryopreserved hiPSC-CMs from one line exhibited longer action potential durations.
These results provide evidence that cryopreservation does not compromise the in vitro molecular,
physiological and mechanical properties of hiPSC-CMs, though can lead to an enrichment in ventricular
myocytes. It also validates this procedure for storing hiPSC-CMs, thereby allowing the same batch of
hiPSC-CMs to be used for multiple applications and evaluations.

1. Introduction
Human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) are now an established in vitro
model and tool for studying cardiovascular development and disease, safety pharmacology and drug
development, as well as having potential therapeutic applications (Brandão et al., 2017; Gerbin and
Murry, 2015; Hartman et al., 2016; Magdy et al., 2018). Due to the significant progress made in
efficiently differentiating hPSCs to cardiomyocytes, it is now possible to generate the large quantities
of hPSC-CMs required for these purposes which can then be evaluated using a multitude of assays
(Denning et al., 2016). To facilitate this, cryopreservation of hPSC-CMs is essential. Not only does the
ability to freeze hPSC-CMs make the generation of these cells more cost and time effective, it also
enables the same batch of hPSC-CMs to be analysed at multiple time points; thereby reducing this
source of variability when performing multiple assays to investigate a disease phenotype or when
performing large-scale drug discovery screens. From a clinical perspective, cryopreservation of the
hPSC-CMs is also a necessary step to provide sufficient time for performing quality control checks
(Fujita and Zimmermann, 2018). Furthermore, cryopreservation allows the hPSC-CMs to be easily
distributed among users, including to laboratories without the expertise or infrastructure to culture
and differentiate hPSCs. Indeed, there are now several commercial suppliers that distribute
cryopreserved hPSC-CMs for both academic and commercial applications (Blinova et al., 2018;
Kitaguchi et al., 2016; Maddah et al., 2015).
Several reports have described procedures for freezing hPSC-CMs and using the resulting
cryopreserved hPSC-CMs, for example in transplantation studies or for the generation of engineered
heart tissue (Breckwoldt et al., 2017; Chong et al., 2014). While these protocols vary in the composition
of the freezing medium, the majority include 10% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) as a cryoprotective agent
and require the hPSC-CMs to be enzymatically dissociated into single cells. Obviously, it is critical that
the cryopreservation procedure does not alter the molecular, biochemical or functional phenotype of
the hPSC-CMs. While it has been demonstrated that frozen hPSC-CMs are viable upon thawing, express
cardiac-specific markers, exhibit typical electrophysiological, calcium handling and contractility
characteristics, and can electrically couple in grafts (Blinova et al., 2018; Gerbin et al., 2015; Hwang et
al., 2015; Kim et al., 2011; Puppala et al., 2013), these studies did not compare freshly-derived hPSCCMs head-to-head with frozen-thawed batches. The few studies that have undertaken such a
comparison have focussed on cardiomyocyte purity and viability immediately after thawing, as well as
engraftment efficiency in rodents and non-human primates (Chen et al., 2015; Chong et al., 2014; Xu
et al., 2011).

To date there have been no reports comparing the in vitro phenotype and physiological properties of
cryopreserved and non-frozen hPSC-CMs following replating. Such studies are warranted due to the
increasing use of hPSC-CMs for investigating disease mechanisms and in safety pharmacology assays
(Brandão et al., 2017; Denning et al., 2016; Giacomelli et al., 2017). For this reason, we have evaluated
freshly-derived and cryopreserved cardiomyocytes generated from two different human induced
pluripotent stem cell lines (hiPSC-CMs). The hiPSC-CMs were compared in terms of replating and
cardiomyocyte subtype, as well as their electrophysiological and mechanical properties. Although the
cryopreserved cells exhibited poorer replating efficiency after thawing, when this was adjusted for,
there was no difference in the proportion of cardiomyocytes recovered compared to the non-frozen
cells. Similarly, there was no significant difference in the percentage of ventricular hiPSC-CMs.
However, hiPSC-CMs from one line did show prolonged action potential (AP) duration in the
cryopreserved compared to the fresh cardiomyocytes. Besides this, no other differences in the
electrical and mechanical properties were observed, indicating that cryopreservation does not appear
to be detrimental for the physiological attributes of hiPSC-CMs in vitro. As such, this study confirms
that cryopreserved hPSC-CMs retain their in vitro molecular and functional characteristics and
validates this as an opportune method for stockpiling hPSC-CMs for their use in downstream
applications.

2. Results
2.1 Differentiation of hiPSCs to cardiomyocytes
Two independent hiPSC lines (LUMC20 and LUMC99) were differentiated into cardiomyocytes, with
spontaneously contracting regions typically observed around day 8 (d8) of differentiation (Fig. 1A and
1B). Both cell lines efficiently generated cardiomyocytes, with on average 82.7%±7.6% (LUMC20) and
86.5%±3.0% (LUMC99) of cells expressing the pan-cardiomyocyte marker cardiac troponin T (cTnT) at
d21 of differentiation (Fig. 1C and 1D). At d21, the hiPSC-CMs were dissociated and either immediately
replated (fresh) or cryopreserved for at least 7 days (on average 28 days). Cryopreservation was
performed by a rate-controlled (-1˚C/minute) temperature decrease to -80˚C in a freezing medium
comprising 90% KnockOut Serum Replacement (KSR) and 10% DMSO. Non-frozen and thawed hiPSCCMs from the same differentiation were compared under identical experimental conditions in terms
of replating efficiency, cardiac marker expression, and biophysical characteristics (AP and contraction).

2.2 Cryopreservation affects cell survival of replated cultures but not the relative hiPSCCM contribution
To evaluate whether cryopreservation had any effect on cell viability, dissociated hiPSC-CMs were
stained with Trypan blue before and after freezing (Fig. 2A). There was no significant difference in the
percentage of viable cells for LUMC20 (98.3±0.3% non-frozen vs 95.7±1.4% frozen, p=0.08; unpaired
t-test), indicating that the cryopreservation procedure did not cause significant necrosis. While
cryopreserved hiPSC-CMs attached and expressed the cardiac markers α-actinin and myosin heavy
chain (Fig. 2B), 24h after replating the recovery of the cryopreserved cultures was approximately half
that of their freshly replated counterparts (15.5x10-3 ± 1.9x10-3 A.U. non-frozen vs 9.2x10-3 ± 1.0x10-3
A.U. frozen per 1.0x104 cells seeded) (Fig. 2C). This difference persisted for at least 7 days postreplating, suggesting that there was also no difference in proliferation rates between the differentiated
cultures that were freshly replated or cryopreserved. Similar differences in replating efficiency were
also observed for differentiated cells from LUMC99 (Supplementary Fig. S1).
We therefore assessed whether this difference affected the proportion of hiPSC-CMs present in the
replated cultures by flow cytometric analysis for cTnT, as well as the atrial and ventricular myosin light
chain (MLC) isoforms (MLC2a and MLC2v respectively). The replating density did not affect the
proportion of hiPSC-CMs that recovered when the cells were freshly replated (Supplementary Fig.
S2A), therefore the non-frozen hiPSC-CMs were subsequently always seeded at 0.9x105/cm2. However
for the cryopreserved cells, higher seeding densities improved hiPSC-CM recovery based on the

proportion of cells expressing cTnT (Supplementary Fig. S2B), resulting in similar percentages to that
observed in the corresponding non frozen hiPSC-CMs (Fig. 2D and 2E). Altering the seeding density
also resulted in a corresponding increase in MLC2a+ and MLC2v+ cells (Fig. 2D and Supplementary Fig.
S2B), although the overall percentage of hiPSC-CMs (cTnT+ cells) expressing these markers did not vary
between the different seeding densities (Fig. 2F). This indicated that while higher seeding densities
improved the recovery of cryopreserved hiPSC-CMs, it did not influence the cardiomyocyte subtype or
maturity.
We therefore factored in the difference in replating efficiency between the non-frozen and
cryopreserved hiPSC-CMs by seeding approximately twice as many cryopreserved hiPSC-CMs per cm2.
We then observed no difference in the percentage of cTnT+ hiPSC-CMs in the replated populations for
the LUMC20 line (78.6±6.8% non-frozen vs 79.6±6.7% frozen), as well as for the LUMC99 line
(73.4±10.0% non-frozen vs 61.9±11.8% frozen) (Fig. 2G). Similarly, there was no difference in the
proportion of hiPSC-CMs expressing MLC2a (LUMC20, 89.8±1.9% vs 84.7±4.4%; LUMC99, 86.1±4.6%
vs 89.0±8.7%; non-frozen vs frozen) (Fig. 2G). Although not significant, we did observe a trend towards
a higher percentage of hiPSC-CMs expressing MLC2v following cryopreservation for both cell lines
(LUMC20, 41.7±8.8% vs 62.1±8.2%; LUMC99, 36.1±12.0% vs 44.3±19.0%; non-frozen vs frozen) (Fig.
2G), suggesting that cryopreservation might promote the maturation of hiPSC-CMs to a ventricular
subtype. Prolonged storage of the hiPSC-CMs did not affect expression of these cardiac markers, with
the same batch of cells having similar values at both 1- and 8-months post-cryopreservation
(Supplementary Fig. S3). Taken together, these results indicated that while frozen hiPSC-CMs
exhibited poorer replating efficiencies, cryopreservation did not significantly affect the proportion of
hiPSC-CMs or subtypes recovered after both short-and long-term storage. However, an increase in the
proportion of hiPSC-CMs expressing MLC2v was observed compared to the non-frozen counterparts.

2.3 Cryopreservation is not detrimental to the electrical activity of hiPSC-CMs
Next, we performed AP measurements of fresh and cryopreserved hiPSC-CMs generated from the
same differentiation. APs were recorded from single spontaneously contracting hiPSC-CMs, and to
obtain a close-to-physiological resting membrane potential (RMP) we injected an in silico inward
rectifier K+ current (IK1) with Kir2.1 characteristics using dynamic clamp methodology (Meijer van
Putten et al., 2015). Fig. 3A shows representative APs from frozen and non-frozen cardiomyocytes
derived from the two hiPSC lines, and average AP characteristics are summarized in Fig. 3B (LUMC20)
and Fig. 3C (LUMC99). Neither maximum AP upstroke velocity (Vmax) nor AP amplitude (APA) showed
significant differences between fresh and cryopreserved hiPSC-CMs from both hiPSC lines. The RMP as

well as AP duration (APD) at 20, 50, and 90% repolarisation (APD20, APD50, and APD90, respectively)
were unaffected by cryopreservation for hiPSC-CMs derived from the LUMC99 hiPSC line (Fig. 3C).
However, cryopreserved hiPSC-CMs from the LUMC20 hiPSC line showed a hyperpolarised RMP and
prolonged APD (Fig. 3B). While differences in RMP might affect APDs by altering availability of sodium,
calcium and potassium currents (Verkerk et al., 2017), we found no correlation between APD90 and
RMP (data not shown), suggesting that the longer APs in the frozen LUMC20 hiPSC-CMs may be due
to the greater proportion of MLC2v+ cardiomyocytes. Nevertheless, these results indicated that
cryopreservation is not detrimental to the electrophysiological properties of the hiPSC-CMs in vitro.

2.4 Frozen and non-frozen hiPSC-CMs display similar contraction characteristics
Finally, we investigated whether cryopreservation affected the contractility of hiPSC-CMs relative to
their fresh counterparts. Spontaneously contracting monolayers of hiPSC-CMs as well as single cells
were recorded with a high-sampling rate camera (100 fps) and analysed using the automated open
source software tool MUSCLEMOTION (Sala et al., 2018). We chose to examine cardiomyocytes from
the hiPSC line LUMC20 due to this line showing electrophysiological differences between the two
groups. Representative contraction traces of fresh and cryopreserved hiPSC-CM monolayers paced at
1 Hz are shown in Fig. 4A, while the contraction parameters analysed are illustrated in Fig. 4B. Because
the recordings of frozen and non-frozen hiPSC-CMs could not be made concurrently, exposure
conditions varied thereby precluding the comparison of contraction amplitudes between the two
groups. Therefore, contraction traces are presented with a contraction amplitude normalized to the
maximal value.
Contraction duration at 90% peak amplitude (CD90), time-to-peak, and relaxation time at day 3 and 7
post-replating were very similar between the fresh and cryopreserved cells in both hiPSC-CM
monolayers and single cells (Fig. 4C and 4D). Congruently, no differences were observed for
contraction duration (CD) at 10 and 50% peak amplitude (CD10 and CD50 respectively) values between
the fresh and cryopreserved hiPSC-CMs (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Neither were differences detected
when the fresh and cryopreserved hiPSC-CMs were stimulated at 2 Hz (Supplementary Fig. S4B-4D).
Overall these results indicated that cryopreservation does not affect the contractility of the hiPSC-CMs.

3. Discussion
Advances in hPSC-CM generation and phenotyping have made them valuable as in vitro models for
studying human heart development and cardiovascular disease, as well as for cardiac safety
pharmacology, drug screening, and drug discovery (Brandão et al., 2017; Gerbin and Murry, 2015;
Hartman et al., 2016; Magdy et al., 2018). While it is now possible to efficiently generate large
quantities of relatively pure hPSC-CMs (Kempf and Zweigerdt, 2018), these procedures are timeconsuming, laborious, and are still subject to variability in reproducibility between successive
differentiations (Burridge et al., 2015; Kempf et al., 2014). Efforts to cryopreserve hPSC-CMs have led
to improved consistency in functional assays with comparable results obtained when the same batch
of cells are used even between different laboratories (Hwang et al., 2015; Millard et al., 2018).
However, evaluation of the effect of cryopreservation on the in vitro characteristics of the hPSC-CMs
are limited. For example, previous studies have either only assessed the cryopreserved hPSC-CMs
(Hwang et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2011; Puppala et al., 2013), or comparisons were performed on cells
immediately before and after thawing without assessing the recovery of the culture (Chen et al., 2015).
Here we have directly compared the phenotype and physiological properties of frozen and non-frozen
hPSC-CMs generated from the same differentiation experiment over a 10 day period post-replating.
We have found that while cryopreservation can cause poorer replating of the hiPSC-CMs, this is not
detrimental to their electrophysiological or contractile properties.
The (approximately two-fold) lower replating efficiency of the cryopreserved hPSC-CMs compared to
non-frozen cells is possibly due to cryoprotectant solution (90% KSR, 10% DMSO) or the freezing
protocol (-1°C/min to -80°C) used in this study, and further optimisation of these steps would likely
improve the recovery rate. Several other reports have used foetal bovine serum (FBS) instead of KSR
(Hwang et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2011). We chose not to include animal serum since it is undefined, can
show batch variability and because all other maintenance and differentiation media used were serumfree. Other cryoprotectant solutions such as CryoStor CS-10 have also been used to cryopreserve hPSCCMs (Chen et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2011); however we observed similar levels of recovery with this
solution (data not shown). DMSO has been shown to be more cytotoxic to hiPSCs than other
cryoprotective agents (Katkov et al., 2011), and so is also likely a cause of similar negative effects on
hPSC-CMs. It is also apparent that the optimal cooling rate for cell survival varies depending on the cell
type (Hunt, 2017). Therefore, further investigation of the most suitable cryoprotective agent and
optimal cooling protocol for hPSC-CMs is warranted, in particular where these cells may be used
therapeutically and large numbers of viable hPSC-CMs are required.

When the poorer replating efficiency of the cryopreserved hPSC-CMs was factored in to the replating
density, there was no difference in the proportion of cardiomyocytes recovered when compared to
non-frozen hPSC-CMs replated from the same differentiation experiment. Interestingly, in the hiPSC
line LUMC20, we observed a trend towards a higher proportion of hPSC-CMs expressing the ventricular
marker MLC2v following cryopreservation although this did not reach statistical significance. However,
the cryopreserved cardiomyocytes from this cell line did display an increase in APD. These differences
raise the possibility that cryopreservation could improve the functional maturation of hPSC-CMs. A
similar observation was evident in hPSC-CMs stored under hypothermic conditions (+4°C), with the
expression of several cardiomyocyte-specific genes including MLC2V significantly upregulated (Correia
et al., 2016). The exact mechanism by which cold preservation could induce hPSC-CM maturation is
unclear but hypothermic storage does increase caspase activity which has been demonstrated to
promote the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived cardiac progenitors (Bulatovic
et al., 2015). Alternatively, exposure of the hPSC-CMs to DMSO may also contribute to the enrichment
in ventricular cardiomyocytes. Treatment of cultures with DMSO can downregulate Oct-4 expression
in mouse embryoid bodies as well as improve the differentiation of human ESC-derived pancreatic
progenitors to terminal cell types (Adler et al., 2006; Chetty et al., 2013). In these studies, the
concentration of DMSO was lower (<2% vs 10% in the cryoprotectant) but exposure was prolonged (12 days). Further studies are warranted to investigate whether cryopreservation or exposure of the
hPSC-CMs to the cryoprotectant leads to enrichment of ventricular cardiomyocytes.
Importantly these results demonstrate that cryopreservation of hPSC-CMs does not adversely affect
their functionality. We believe this is the first reported head-to-head comparative study that has
systematically quantified APs and contraction kinetics in non-frozen and frozen hiPSC-CMs obtained
from the same differentiation. Although the electrophysiological characteristics of fresh and
cryopreserved cardiomyocytes derived from the human ESC line H7 have been analysed (Peng et al.,
2010; Xu et al., 2011), these studies were performed using different experimental conditions, including
the age of the hPSC-CMs measured, composition of electrophysiological solutions, recording
conditions and classification of the cardiomyocytes. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the
prolonged APD90 and slower Vmax observed in the frozen hPSC-CMs in these studies was due to the
cryopreservation or experimental setup.
In conclusion, we have shown that apart from replating efficiency, cryopreservation is not detrimental
to hiPSC-CMs. Further modifications of the cryoprotectant solution composition as well as the freezing
and thawing process will likely further improve this. The ability to freeze and recover functional hPSCCMs, along with recent advances in efficient differentiation of hPSCs to cardiomyocytes, will likely

contribute to improvements in standardisation. Not only will this enable the same batch of hPSC-CMs
to be used in multiple assays and thereby allowing more direct comparisons for cardiac disease
modelling, it will also overcome some of the challenges in using hPSC-CMs for large-scale screening of
pharmacological compounds. Finally, facilitating distribution of identical batches hPSC-CMs between
laboratories might lead to improved experimental reliability and robustness and contribute to
addressing reproducibility issues in the field.

4. Material and Methods
4.1 hiPSC-CM differentiation
Subclones from two independent hiPSC lines (LUMC0020 and LUMC0099) were maintained in Essential
8 medium (Gibco). One day prior to differentiation (d-1), the hiPSCs were harvested using TrypLE Select
(Gibco) and plated onto Matrigel-coated wells in Essential 8 medium containing Revitacell (1:200
dilution; Gibco) at 3.9 x 104/cm2 in 12-well cell culture plates. The hiPSCs were differentiated into
cardiomyocytes using the Pluricyte Cardiomyocyte Differentiation Kit (NCardia BV) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The hiPSC-CMs were maintained in Medium C (NCardia) until day 20-21
of differentiation and then dissociated as previously described (Van Den Berg et al., 2014).

4.2 hiPSC-CM cryopreservation, storage and thawing
The hiPSC-CMs were cryopreserved in a freezing medium comprising 90% KSR (Gibco) and 10% DMSO.
Cryovials containing ~1 x 106 cells in 300 µl freezing medium were rate-controlled (-1˚C/minute) frozen
to -80˚C. Approximately 24 hours later, the vials were transferred and stored in liquid nitrogen (196˚C). For thawing, the vial was incubated at 37°C and the thawed cells transferred to a conical tube.
Immediately thereafter, 1 ml of BPEL medium (Van Den Berg et al., 2014) was added dropwise (1 drop
every 5 seconds), followed by ~4.7 ml BPEL (1 drop every 2 seconds). Cell were precipitated at 250g
for 3 min and resuspended in Medium C.

4.3 Replating of hiPSC-CMs
Fresh and thawed hiPSC-CMs were replated on Matrigel-coated glass coverslips, or in 24-well cell
culture plates in Medium C supplemented with RevitaCell (1:100 dilution) at the densities indicated.
Approximately 24 hours after plating the medium was refreshed, and subsequently every 2-3 days
thereafter until the experiment was terminated.

4.4 Cell viability and replating efficiency
The viability of the dissociated hiPSC-CMs was determined by trypan blue staining (Davis et al., 2009).
The viability and recovery of the replated cells was assessed at multiple time points using the CCK8
assay (Dojindo). For this, cells were seeded in multiple wells of a 24-well plate at varying densities (3.711

14.7 x 104/cm2). For each timepoint, the cell culture medium was removed and replaced with 330 µl
of reaction mixture (300 µl Medium C + 30 µl CCK8 reagent) per well. After 2.5h at 37˚C, 100 µl from
each well was transferred to a 96-well plate and the optical density (OD) at 450 nm measured using a
Victor X3 microplate reader (Perkin Elmer). Reaction mixture added to a well without cells served as a
blank control and was used to subtract the background fluorescence from the samples. The OD per 1
x 104 cells was then calculated. After measuring, the CCK8 treated-cells were washed twice with cell
culture medium and replaced with Medium C.

4.5 Flow cytometry
Cells were plated in 24-well cell culture plates at densities between 0.9 and 2.1 x 105/cm2.
Approximately 7 days post-seeding, the cells were dissociated using TrypLE Select and filtered to
remove cell aggregates. The cells were incubated with a ViobilityTM 405/520 fixable dye (Miltenyi
Biotech) prior to fixation (FIX and PERM kit, Invitrogen) for subsequent exclusion of dead cells. Cells
were co-labelled with cTnT (Vioblue-conjugated), MLC2a (APC- or FITC-conjugated), and MLC2v (PEconjugated) antibodies (all Miltenyi). All antibodies were used at a concentration of 1:11 in
permeabilization medium (medium B; Invitrogen). Data was acquired using a MacsQuant VYB flow
cytometer (Miltenyi) and analysed with the software FlowJo (FlowJo, LLC).

4.6 Immunohistochemistry
The hiPSC-CMs were plated on glass coverslips at 0.7-1.3 x 104/cm2 and fixed 6 days later using the
Inside Stain Kit (Miltenyi) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Fixed cells were incubated with αactinin (1:250; Sigma) and myosin heavy chain (1:50; Miltenyi) antibodies. The primary antibodies were
detected with AF594- (1:200; Life Technologies) and Vio515- (1:100; Miltenyi) conjugated secondary
antibodies, respectively. All antibodies were diluted in permeabilization medium and incubated for 10
minutes. Cells were stained with 4’,6 Diamidino-2-Phenylindole (DAPI) (0.3 µM) for 5 minutes. Images
were captured using a confocal laser scanning microscope SP8 (Leica).

4.7 Action potential measurements
The hiPSC-CMs were plated on 10 mm glass coverslips at 1.0 x 104/cm2 and APs were recorded 8-10
days later using the perforated patch-clamp technique and an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular
Devices). Single cells with spontaneous contractions (indicating the viable state of the cells) were
selected. Using dynamic clamp, an in silico 2 pA/pF IK1 with Kir2.1 characteristics was injected to obtain
quiescent cells with a close-to-physiological RMP as previously described (Meijer van Putten et al.,
2015). Data acquisition, voltage control, and analysis was performed using custom made software and
the potentials were corrected for the calculated liquid junction potential (Barry and Lynch, 1991). The

patch pipettes, estimations of cell membrane capacitance, and filtering and digitizing settings were as
described previously (Verkerk et al., 2017).
Cells were superfused with modified Tyrode’s solution (36 ± 0.2°C) containing (in mM): 140 NaCl; 5.4
KCl; 1.8 CaCl2; 1.0 MgCl2, 5.5 glucose; and 5.0 HEPES. (pH was set at 7.4 using NaOH). Pipettes were
filled with a solution containing (in mM): 125 K-gluconate; 20 KCl; 5.0 NaCl; 0.44 amphotericin-B; and
10 HEPES (pH 7.2; KOH). APs were elicited at 1 Hz by 3 ms, ~1.2x threshold current pulses through the
patch pipette, and analysed for RMP, Vmax, APA, APD20, APD50, and APD90. Parameters from 13
consecutive APs were averaged.

4.8 Contraction measurements
The contraction of single cells and monolayers of hiPSC-CMs was determined by seeding cells on 10
mm glass coverslips at a density of 1.0 or 12.7 x 104/cm2 respectively. At day 3 and 7 post plating,
coverslips were transferred into a bath superfused with modified Tyrode solution at 37˚C. The single
cells and monolayers were paced at 1 and 2 Hz using an external field stimulator. A 10s movie was
recorded using a DCC3240M camera (Thorlabs) with a sampling rate of 100 frames per second (fps).
From the normalized contraction traces, the CD10, CD50, CD90, time-to-peak, and relaxation time
were calculated using the automated, open source software tool MUSCLEMOTION21.

4.9 Statistical data analysis
All data are presented as mean ± SEM. Statistical tests performed are listed in the Results section or in
the Fig. legends. Differences were considered statistically significant at p<0.05. Analyses were
conducted with Graphpad Prism 7 software.
