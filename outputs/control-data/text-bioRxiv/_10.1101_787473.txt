Abstract

16

Disruption of nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT), including mislocalization of the importin b

17

cargo, TDP-43, is a hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), including ALS caused by a

18

hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9orf72. However, the mechanism(s) remain unclear.

19

Importin b and its cargo adaptors have been shown to co-precipitate with the C9orf72-arginine-

20

containing dipeptide repeat proteins (R-DPRs), poly-glycine arginine (GR) and poly-proline

21

arginine (PR), and are protective in genetic modifier screens. Here, we show that R-DPRs

22

interact with importin b, disrupt its cargo loading, and inhibit nuclear import in permeabilized

23

mouse neurons and HeLa cells, in a manner that can be rescued by RNA. Although R-DPRs

24

induce widespread protein aggregation in this in vitro system, transport disruption is not due to

25

NCT protein sequestration, nor blockade of the phenylalanine-glycine (FG)-rich nuclear pore

26

complex. Our results support a model in which R-DPRs interfere with nuclear transport

27

receptors in the vicinity of the nuclear envelope.

Introduction
A GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) in C9orf72 is the most common

30

known cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and is also a major cause of frontotemporal

31

dementia (FTD) and the ALS /FTD overlap syndrome (DeJesus-Hernandez et al., 2011; Renton

32

et al., 2011; Majounie et al., 2012). The C9orf72 HRE is thought to cause disease by a toxic

33

gain of function involving expanded repeat RNA and dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs) produced

34

by repeat-associated (non-AUG) translation, although a modest reduction in C9ORF72 protein

35

is also seen (reviewed by Cook and Petrucelli, 2019). Predicted products of C9orf72 HRE

36

translation in both the sense (poly-GP, poly-GA, poly-GR) and antisense (poly-GP, poly-PR,

37

poly-PA) directions have been identified in postmortem tissue (Zu et al., 2013; Ash et al., 2013;

38

Mackenzie et al., 2013), and overexpression of a subset of DPRs, including poly-GA and the

39

arginine-containing DPRs poly-GR and poly-PR (R-DPRs), is toxic in cell culture (May et al.,

40

2014; Wen et al., 2014) and animal models (Zhang et al., 2016; 2018; 2019).

41

Growing evidence suggests that disruption of nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT), the

42

regulated trafficking of proteins and ribonucleoprotein complexes between the nucleus and

43

cytoplasm, is a major pathophysiologic mechanism in neurodegenerative diseases (reviewed

44

by Hutten and Dormann, 2019). Bidirectional NCT across the nuclear envelope occurs through

45

nuclear pore complexes (NPC), which are large (125 MDa) assemblies comprised of multiple

46

copies of ~30 different nucleoporins (Nups) (Reichelt et al., 1990). Whereas small cargoes

47

passively equilibrate across the NPC, larger cargoes are increasingly excluded by a matrix of

48

natively-unfolded phenylalanine-glycine (FG)-rich nucleoporins lining the central channel

49

(Timney et al., 2016; Frey et al., 2018; Mohr et al., 2009). Transport of restricted cargoes

50

requires nuclear transport receptors (importins, exportins, and transportins, aka NTRs or

51

karyopherins), which mediate the rapid transport of cargo through the FG-barrier (reviewed by

52

(Pemberton and Paschal, 2005). The small GTPase Ran dictates the directionality of transport

53

via a steep concentration gradient of RanGTP across the nuclear membrane, established by the

54

nuclear guanine nucleotide exchange factor RCC1 and the cytoplasmic GTPase-activating

55

protein RanGAP1. Nuclear RanGTP promotes importin-cargo unloading and exportin-cargo

56

complex assembly, while the cytoplasmic conversion of RanGTP to RanGDP disassembles

57

exportin-cargo complexes and enables importin-cargo binding. We and others have found

58

evidence of NCT disruption in postmortem tissue and animal models of C9orf72-ALS,

59

Alzheimer’s disease, and Huntington's disease, including mislocalization and loss of Nups and

60

disruption of the Ran gradient (Zhang et al., 2015; Grima et al., 2017; Eftekharzadeh et al.,

61

2018).

62

Cytoplasmic mislocalization of the importin b cargo TDP-43, a predominantly nuclear

63

DNA/RNA-binding protein that undergoes nucleocytoplasmic shuttling (Pinarbasi et al., 2018), is

64

a major pathological hallmark of ALS, including C9orf72-ALS (Neumann et al., 2006; Mackenzie

65

et al., 2014). Although importin b directly imports a subset of cargoes, most (including TDP-43)

66

are recruited via a heterodimer with importin a, bound by its importin b-binding domain (IBB),

67

leading to formation of a trimeric import complex (cargo•importin a•importin b) (reviewed by

68

(Lott and Cingolani, 2011). Classical and non-classical nuclear localization signals (NLS) of

69

importin b cargoes and the IBB (a disordered region that is also a functional NLS), are enriched

70

in arginine and lysine residues that mediate high-affinity interactions within the import complex.

71

C9orf72 genetic modifier screens have identified a beneficial role for NTRs, including importin b

72

and its importin a family of cargo adaptors (Zhang et al., 2015; Freibaum et al., 2015; Jovičić et

73

al., 2015; Boeynaems et al., 2016; Kramer et al., 2018). Moreover, multiple interactome screens

74

have shown that R-DPRs co-precipitate with importin b, indicating a possible direct interaction

75

(Lee et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2016; Yin et al., 2017). We hypothesized that R-DPRs may directly

76

interact with importin b by mimicking the arginine-and lysine-rich IBB, disrupting nuclear import

77

complex formation.

78

Here, we use FRET and biochemical assays to show that R-DPRs interact with importin

79

b, disrupt import complex formation, and confer dose- and length- dependent disruption of

80

importin b-mediated nuclear import in the permeabilized cell assay, which we adapted for

81

primary neurons. Addition of R-DPRs to the transport assay triggers rapid formation of insoluble

82

aggregates, which recruit numerous RNA-binding and ribosomal proteins, as well as NPC and

83

NCT proteins. However, by separating the soluble and insoluble phases of the reaction, we

84

show that transport disruption is not due to sequestration of NCT components, nor the ability of

85

R-DPRs to impede passage through the NPC, but due to perturbation of soluble transport

86

factors, an effect that is reversible by RNA. Taken together, these data support a model of R-

87

DPR-based NCT inhibition via disruption of importin a/b-heterodimer formation.

R-DPRs bind importin b and inhibit nuclear import

92

Although importin b has been shown to co-precipitate with poly-GR and poly-PR, a direct

93

interaction between R-DPRs and importin β has not been demonstrated, and the consequences

94

for functional nuclear import are unknown. To test for an interaction between C9orf72 DPRs and

95

importin β, we used a variant of the FRET sensor Rango (“Ran-regulated importin β cargo”)

96

(Kalab et al., 2006), which consists of the importin β-binding domain (IBB) of importin α1

97

(KPNA2), flanked by CyPet (donor) and YPet (acceptor). When bound to importin β (KPNB1),

98

Rango FRET is low, but in the presence of RanGTP, importin β is displaced from the sensor

99

and FRET increases (Figure 1A-C). Since conserved arginine and lysine residues of the IBB

100

domain are required for binding to importin β (Görlich et al., 1996; Weis et al., 1996; Cingolani et

101

al., 1999), we hypothesized that the arginine-rich DPRs could bind to the corresponding sites on

102

importin β and compete with the IBB. Synthetic GP10, GA10, and PA10 peptides did not affect

103

Rango FRET even at high concentrations (Figure 1D). However, we observed a dose-

104

dependent increase in FRET with low-nanomolar PR10 and GR10, indicating these DPRs are

105

capable of binding to importin β and displacing the sensor. To further validate these

106

observations, we used GFP nanobody-coated beads to bind Rango and probe for co-

107

immunoprecipitation of importin β in the presence of increasing concentrations of GR10 and

108

PR10 (Figure 1E-F). Again, we observed the dose-dependent displacement of importin β from

109

the sensor at low nanomolar concentrations, confirming that Rango release was responsible for

110

the increases in FRET.

111

To test the functional consequence of R-DPR-importin β interactions for nuclear import,

112

we performed the permeabilized cell assay (Adam et al., 1990), in which the plasma membrane

113

of cultured cells is selectively permeabilized, leaving the nuclear membrane intact as verified by

114

nuclear exclusion of 70 kD dextran (Figure 1G). Fluorescent transport cargo is then added, with

115

energy regeneration mix and cell lysate to provide a source of importins and Ran for nuclear

116

import, which is measured by increasing nuclear fluorescence. Traditionally, this method uses

117

digitonin for permeabilization; however, when attempted with primary mouse cortical neurons,

118

we repeatedly found that even minimal concentrations of digitonin opened both the plasma and

119

nuclear membranes. Since the nuclear envelope is devoid of the digitonin target cholesterol

120

(Colbeau et al., 1971; Adam et al., 1990), we reasoned that its rupture in permeabilized

121

neuronal cells was caused by mechanical perturbation upon removal of cytoplasmic proteins.

122

Therefore, we developed a new protocol involving hypotonic cell opening in the presence of a

123

high concentration of BSA as a cushion, which facilitated the selective plasma membrane

124

opening of neurons (Figure 1-figure supplement 1).

125

Using this method, we performed live imaging of nuclear import of Rango, a direct

126

importin β cargo whose Ran-, importin β-, and energy-dependent nuclear translocation is

127

conferred by the IBB domain (Kalab et al., 2006). We verified that Rango import in

128

permeabilized neurons is indeed dependent on energy and cell lysate, and can be inhibited by

129

the importin β small molecule inhibitor, importazole (IPZ) in primary cortical neurons (Figure 1-

130

figure supplement 1) (Soderholm et al., 2011). Time-lapse imaging of Rango import for 30

131

minutes in permeabilized neurons showed no effect of GP10, GA10, or PA10 at up to 100 µM,

132

whereas GR10 and PR10 showed dose-dependent inhibition of transport (Figure 1H-J). The

133

reaction was allowed to reach steady-state and fixed at 2 hours, at which point we observed

134

statistically-significant transport inhibition beginning at 25 µM for both GR and PR (Figure 1K),

135

with estimated IC50s as shown in figure 1L. In contrast, only trace inhibition by GA10 and PA10

136

was seen even at 100 µM, and there was no effect of 100 µM GP10. To facilitate testing of a

137

broader range of cargoes and concentrations, we performed the assay in HeLa cells, with

138

similar results to those seen in neurons (Figure 1L and Figure 1-figure supplement 2). To verify

139

that the behavior of Rango in nuclear import signals indeed corresponds to endogenous

140

importin α/β complexes, we tested the effect of DPRs on import of GST-GFP-NLS (hereafter

141

referred to as GFP-NLS), a similarly-sized cargo that is loaded on importin β-bound importin α.

142

Consistent with the expected lower efficiency of tripartite nuclear import complex assembly, R-

143

DPRs perturbed GFP-NLS import even more strongly than that of Rango (Figure 1L and Figure

144

1-figure supplement 2).

145

The mechanisms of cargo recognition for importin b differ significantly even from its

146

structurally closest relative TNPO1 (KPNB2), whose cargos are marked by the PY-NLS motif

147

(Lee et al., 2006). However, since the sequence of the PY-NLS also contains basic residues, we

148

tested the effect of R-DPRs on the nuclear import of YFP-M9-CFP (hereafter referred to as M9),

149

a TNPO1 substrate based on the prototypic PY-NLS sequence of hnRNPA1 (Siomi and

150

Dreyfuss, 1995) (Figure 1L and Figure 1-figure supplement 2). All substrates showed selective

151

inhibition by GR and PR, which was more potent for PR and approximately 3-fold more potent

152

on average for 20mers than 10mers. These results confirm that R-DPRs inhibit both importin β-

153

and TNPO1-mediated nuclear import in this in vitro model system.

R-DPRs interact with importin b in the bead halo assay
To further validate the direct interaction between R-DPRs and importin b, we performed

157

the bead halo assay. This equilibrium-based binding assay is capable of identifying both low-

158

and high-affinity interactions between ‘bait’ proteins immobilized to beads, and fluorescent ‘prey’

159

in the surrounding buffer, which forms a fluorescent halo on the bead surface (Patel et al., 2007;

160

Patel and Rexach, 2008). First, we examined the propensity for all five DPRs to interact with

161

biotinylated importin β, immobilized on the surface of neutravidin beads (Figure 2A). Controls

162

included bare beads and beads coated with biotinylated BSA. As a positive control, we

163

observed that the Rango sensor exclusively bound to full-length importin β-coated beads, and

164

not the control beads. Fluorescent dextran, the negative control, did not form a halo in any

165

conditions. AF488-labeled PR10 and GR10 (200 nM) both showed a modest degree of non-

166

specific binding to all controls which was equivalent to the binding seen to bare beads.

167

However, there was an approximately two-fold more intense halo around importin β-coated

168

beads versus controls (Figure 2B), as quantified by the ratio of the fluorescent rim of the beads

169

(the intensity around the surface of the beads at their equator) to the background fluorescence

170

(Figure 2-figure supplement 1). When we added 1 mg/ml neuronal lysate to test the stringency

171

of the interaction, all binding between GR10 and the beads, including importin β, was lost

172

(Figure 2C-D). For PR10, nonspecific binding decreased, but the intensity of the importin β halo

173

increased. These findings further support a direct interaction between R-DPRs and importin β,

174

while indicating a higher relative selectivity of PR for importin β, compared to GR.

R-DPRs accelerate passive nuclear influx
To test if the disruption of nuclear import resulted from changes in the passive exclusion

178

limit of NPCs, we tested the effects of R-DPRs on the passive influx of small cargoes. Passive

179

diffusion of GFP and small fluorescent dextrans into nuclei of permeabilized HeLa cells was

180

imaged at 10-second intervals for 5 minutes, and nuclear fluorescence quantified over time. All

181

experiments were done in the context of energy and cell lysate, identical to the active transport

182

conditions, so as not to miss putative effects that may depend on simultaneous active transport

183

(i.e., recruitment of importins and DPRs to the NPC). Under these conditions, we observed the

184

expected differences in the rates of passive influx of 10-, 40-, and 70-kD dextrans, and verified

185

that addition of energy and lysate did not affect the baseline rate of passive influx of GFP (27

186

kD, no NLS) (Figure 3-supplemental figure 1). When we preincubated permeabilized nuclei with

187

high concentrations of R-DPR 10mers or 20mers for 30-60 minutes, we observed no slowing of

188

passive nuclear influx (Figure 3). Instead, R-DPRs accelerated the nuclear influx of both GFP

189

and 40-kD dextran.

190

The rate of passive transport is thought to be governed by the FG-Nup barrier in

191

conjunction with importin b and RanGTP (Ma et al., 2012; Kapinos et al., 2017). PR20 was

192

previously shown by super-resolution microscopy to localize to the central channel of Xenopus

193

oocyte NPCs, where it was hypothesized to inhibit both passive and active nuclear transport via

194

stabilization of FG-domains (Shi et al., 2017). To verify DPR-FG binding, we used the bead halo

195

assay to probe for interactions between all five C9orf72 DPRs and yeast FG and GLFG

196

domains (Figure 3-supplemental figure 2). As in the importin β halo assay, we observed

197

moderate non-selective binding by the R-DPRs to all beads, including those coated with an F-

198

>A mutant construct. However, quantification of the halo intensities showed additional selective

199

binding of both GR10 and PR10 to FG-domains of Nup100 (yeast homolog of Nup98), but not

200

Nsp1 (yeast homolog of Nup62). For PR10, FG-binding could be augmented (to both Nup100

201

and Nsp1 fragments) by adding unlabeled importin β to the assay, suggesting that recruitment

202

of PR to FG domains at the NPC could be mediated in part by an indirect interaction through

203

importin β. Overall, these results support direct and indirect binding of R-DPRs to FG domains.

204

Importantly, based on our passive transport studies, these interactions do not confer an

impedence to transport as previously suggested, but rather a modest increase in NPC

permeability.

R-DPR-induced aggregates recruit NCT proteins
Upon addition of R-DPRs to cell lysate for the transport assays, we observed the rapid

210

formation of insoluble aggregates (Figure 4A). To identify the components of these aggregates

211

and determine their potential relevance for the nuclear import defect, we spun them down and

212

analyzed their protein content via mass spectrometry (Figure 4A-B; data uploaded to

213

http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org). 858 proteins were identified in each of two GR

214

replicates and 758 in two PR replicates, with 647 (67%) in common. Consistent with previous

215

reports, these included numerous nucleic acid-binding proteins and ribosomal subunits. Gene

216

ontology (GO) analysis confirmed enrichment of nucleolar proteins, ribonucleoproteins,

217

spliceosomal complex subunits, stress granule constituents, and others (Figure 4-figure

218

supplement 1). Among these, low complexity domain (LCD)-containing proteins implicated in

219

ALS/FTD were identified including TDP-43, FUS, Matrin-3, and hnRNPs. Multiple NCT proteins

220

including karyopherins, Nups, Ran cycle proteins, and THO complex proteins, which participate

221

in mRNA biogenesis and nuclear export (Rondón et al., 2010), were also found among the

222

identified targets (Figure 4A-B).

223

Next, we validated a subset of these identified proteins by Western blot, focusing on

224

NCT proteins, Nups, and LCD-containing proteins (Figure 4C-D and Figure 4-figure supplement

225

2). We compared supernatant versus pellet fractions for all five DPRs compared to control

226

lysates in which no DPRs were added, to assess the degree to which proteins were being

227

sequestered and depleted from the soluble fraction. We saw enrichment in the pellet for importin

228

β, RanGAP1, TNPO1, Ran, and importin α, with only minor decreases in the supernatant. RCC1

229

was not identified by mass spectrometry, and as predicted did not sediment with the DPRs,

230

serving as a negative control. We also confirmed deposition of nucleoporins 54, 62, 98, and 133

231

in the pellet (Figure 4C-D), along with the low complexity domain (LCD)-containing RNA binding

232

proteins TDP-43, FUS, Matrin-3, hnRNP A1, and hnRNP A2/B1, ribosomal protein RPS6, and

233

the ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX3X (Figure 4-figure supplement 2). As opposed to the

234

NCT proteins, many of these LCD-containing proteins were markedly or completely depleted

235

from the supernatant.

236

These data confirm that R-DPR aggregates can recruit NCT constituents in addition to a

237

host of nucleic acid-binding proteins. However, NCT proteins were not substantially depleted

238

from the supernatant even in the presence of 100 µM GR10 and PR10, suggesting that

239

sequestration of critical NCT factors in these insoluble protein assemblies is unlikely to fully

240

explain the failure of nuclear import in the transport assays.

241
242
243

R-DPR nuclear import blockade does not require aggregates and is rescued by RNA
Cytoplasmic aggregate formation, a well-known pathological hallmark of

244

neurodegenerative disease, has been proposed as a general mechanism for impairment of NCT

245

(Woerner et al., 2016), although there is no evidence that such accumulation alters or

246

disorganizes the NPC. It is unclear whether it is the disordered proteins themselves, or the

247

process of aggregate formation, that may disrupt NCT. To address this question in the context

248

of R-DPR aggregates, we tested several approaches for preventing aggregate formation in our

249

model system. Addition of the aliphatic alcohol, 1,6-hexanediol, previously shown to disrupt GR-

250

and PR-induced protein assemblies (Lee et al., 2016), was incompatible with transport and

251

caused dose-dependent inhibition at baseline (Figure 5-figure supplement 1). This is likely due

252

to disruption of FG-domains within the central channel, as previously reported (Ribbeck and

253

Görlich, 2002). NTRs themselves, as hydrophobic interactors of aggregation-prone RNA binding

254

proteins, have been shown to promote solubility of their cargoes and may have evolved in part

255

as cytoplasmic chaperones (Jäkel et al., 2002; Guo et al., 2018; Hofweber et al., 2018;

256

257

full-length importin β inhibited nuclear import when added to the transport assay, likely due to

258

sequestration of Rango and available RanGTP. Moreover, neither 1,6-hexanediol nor

259

exogenous importin β could reverse mild nuclear import inhibition due to 25 µM PR10 (Figure 5-

260

figure supplement 1).

261

Next, we tested the effect of increasing the concentration of RNA, based on the growing

262

evidence that RNA is an important factor in mediating solubility of RNA-binding proteins

263

(Maharana et al., 2018; Hondele et al., 2019; Mann et al., 2019). When total HEK cell RNA was

264

added to the transport reaction, we saw a dose-dependent rescue of the import defect that was

265

RNAse-sensitive (Figure 5A). However, this did not appear to be attributable to significant

266

reduction of the quantity of insoluble material in the reaction (Figure 5-figure supplement 2).

267

Instead, electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that in a purified system, the RNA binds

268

directly to the DPRs (Figure 5-figure supplement 2).

269

To further test if DPR-induced aggregate formation is relevant to the mechanism of

270

nuclear import blockade, we performed a series of assays in which the supernatant was

271

separated from the insoluble pellet prior to initiating transport (diagrammed in figure 5B). We

272

reasoned that if aggregates sequester key transport factors, the remaining supernatant would

273

be insufficient to drive nuclear import. However, if the aggregates contain inhibitor(s) of nuclear

274

import or are themselves inhibitory, depleting them could rescue transport impairment. The

275

results were markedly different for GR versus PR (Figure 5C). For GR10, removing the

276

insoluble pellet restored nuclear import to normal, confirming that the inhibitory factor was

277

present in (or was) the aggregates. In contrast, nuclear import remained perturbed in the

278

supernatants of the PR10 aggregates, although it was restored by the addition of RNA.

279

Next, we monitored the location of the R-DPRs with respect to the aggregates by adding

280

AF488-labeled DPRs to the transport reactions. By confocal microscopy, we observed that the

281

transport disruption correlated with the presence of DPRs in the vicinity of the nuclear envelope

282

(Figure 5D). AF488-GR10 fully sedimented into the pellet, leaving no visible GR10 in the

283

supernatant, where transport proceeded normally. In contrast, a subset of AF488-PR10

284

remained in the supernatant and was present at the nuclear envelope, paralleling the persistent

285

inhibition of nuclear import by the PR10 supernatants. RNA dispersed AF488-R-DPRs from the

286

permeabilized cell nuclei in all conditions, restoring nuclear import. These results suggest that

287

the import inhibition depends on GR or PR acting directly, rather than through putative

288

intermediary factor(s), to inhibit nuclear import. The strikingly divergent segregation of GR10 vs.

289

PR10 between the soluble and insoluble phase indicated that, while both share importin β as

290

their target, the mechanisms and locations of their intracellular actions could differ significantly.

291

The critical steps of importin β-mediated nuclear import take place at NPCs via

292

interactions with FG-Nups. To test whether interaction between R-DPRs and the NPC is

293

sufficient to confer the block to import, we ran two parallel sets of import reactions (diagrammed

294

in figure 5E). In the “lysate preincubation” paradigm, as for previous active import assays, R-

295

DPRs were added to lysates used to supply transport factors, preincubated for 1 hour, and then

296

added to permeabilized cells along with Rango and energy to initiate the transport reaction. In

297

the “nuclei preincubation” set, we first exposed the permeabilized cell nuclei to R-DPRs (in the

298

presence of lysate and energy, but no fluorescent cargo). After 1 hour, the DPR-lysate mix was

299

removed from the nuclei, and fresh transport lysate, energy, and cargo added to initiate

300

transport (without R-DPRs). We hypothesized that, if the DPRs inhibited Rango import by

301

associating with and perturbing the NPC, we should see reduced import rate in the “nuclei

302

preincubation” group. However, transport proceeded normally (Figure 5F). These results

303

support a model in which the R-DPRs inhibit nuclear import by directly interfering with factor(s)

304

present in the soluble phase of the NCT machinery (Figure 5G), which is consistent with the

305

biochemical evidence for importin β as one of their direct targets.

Discussion
Importin β, together with its importin a family of cargo adaptors, is fundamentally

311

required for the nuclear import of NLS-containing proteins, including TDP-43, whose

312

cytoplasmic mislocalization is observed in ≥97% of ALS cases, including C9orf72-ALS

313

(Neumann et al., 2006; Mackenzie et al., 2014). Here, we demonstrate that C9orf72 R-DPRs

314

interact with importin β, which disrupts import complex formation and inhibits nuclear import in

315

permeabilized cell assays. R-DPRs induce aggregation in the transport assay, including NCT

316

proteins, although the association with aggregates does not substantially reduce the availability

317

of critical components required for nuclear import. Rather, the transport blockade appears to

318

depend on the ability of R-DPRs to interact with soluble nuclear transport receptors in the

319

vicinity of the NPC, an effect which can be rescued by RNA, and is consistent with disruption of

320

nuclear import complexes.

321

Members of the β karyopherin family have been consistently identified as genetic

322

modifiers of C9orf72 toxicity in fly, yeast, and human cell screens (Zhang et al., 2015; Freibaum

323

et al., 2015; Jovičić et al., 2015; Boeynaems et al., 2016; Kramer et al., 2018), and shown to

324

coprecipitate with R-DPRs (Lee et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2016; Yin et al., 2017). Using purified

325

proteins, we demonstrate by FRET, bead halo, and co-immunoprecipitation, that R-DPRs bind

326

importin β with low-nanomolar affinities. Micromolar concentrations were required to observe

327

functional import blockade in the permeabilized cell assay, however 20mers were on average

328

3.3-fold more potent than 10mers across all cargoes, suggesting that longer DPRs, as are likely

329

observed in patients, may be significantly more potent. The true length of R-DPRs in patients is

330

unknown, although high molecular weight smears have been observed by SDS-PAGE (Zu et al.,

331

2013). GGGGCC repeat lengths in the 1000s have been reported in postmortem brain (van

332

Blitterswijk et al., 2013; Dols-Icardo et al., 2014; Nordin et al., 2015), although the processivity

333

of ribosomes along the repeat RNA, and what terminates non-AUG translation, is unclear. The

334

intracellular concentration of R-DPRs is also unknown. By ELISA, the poly-GP concentration in

335

postmortem motor cortex has been estimated at a median of 322 ng/mg protein (Gendron et al.,

336

2015), but comparable measurements for R-DPRs have been technically prohibitive in our

337

hands to date.

338

Importin β is composed of 19 tandem HEAT repeats, coiled into a superhelix with

339

exposed N-terminal RanGTP-binding domain and C-terminal importin a-binding domain

340

(Cingolani et al., 1999). We predicted that R-DPRs might mimic the arginine- and lysine-rich IBB

341

domain of importin a, forming an electrostatic interaction with acidic residues in the C-terminal

342

domain of importin β. Indeed, R-DPRs displaced importin β from the importin a-IBB (Rango)

343

FRET sensor at low nanomolar concentrations, supporting this hypothesis. At present, we

344

cannot exclude binding to importin β at other sites, and given the similarity in HEAT repeat

345

structure throughout the protein, multiple DPR-importin β interaction sites would not be

346

surprising. Based on the propensity of R-DPRs to bind and induce aggregation of intrinsically-

347

disordered proteins, the IBB domains of importins α and snurportin 1, both highly disordered

348

unless bound to importin β (http://mobidb.bio.unipd.it/; Lott and Cingolani, 2011; Piovesan et al.,

349

2018), could also be a target. It is conceivable that R-DPRs could perturb nuclear import by

350

targeting both the IBB- binding site on importin β, and the IBBs on the much less abundant

351

importins α (Görlich et al., 2003). Additional studies are needed to verify the precise domain(s)

352

on importin β to which the R-DPRs bind, and to investigate direct importin α-targeting.

353

PR20 was previously shown to localize to the central channel of the NPC in Xenopus

354

oocytes and inhibit nuclear import of NLS-BSA in permeabilized HeLa cells (Shi et al., 2017). In

355

this study, the import blockade was attributed to binding and stabilization of FG domains in a

356

polymerized state, creating a barrier to transport. We also observed modest R-DPR binding to

357

FG-domains by the bead halo assay, as may be predicted by the ability of arginine-rich domains

358

to undergo cation-pi interactions with aromatic phenylalanine rings. However, when we tested

359

the functional consequences of R-DPRs on passive nuclear influx, a rate that depends both on

360

the FG barrier and resident importin-cargo complexes (Kapinos et al., 2017), we observed

361

marked acceleration. The precise cause is unclear, although the width of the passive channel

362

has been shown to be modulated by the local concentration of importin b and RanGTP,

363

increasing when importin b concentrations are high (Ma et al., 2012). Alternatively, leakiness of

364

the passive barrier was reported in permeabilized cells where importin b/cargo complexes were

365

depleted from the NPC (Kapinos et al., 2017). Additional studies are needed to test these

366

possibilities. Nevertheless, incubation of permeabilized nuclei with high concentrations of R-

367

DPRs blocked neither passive nor active transport. Taken together, these data do not support

368

the hypothesis that alterations in the FG barrier account for R-DPR-mediated nuclear transport

369

blockade.

370

Recent interactome screens have shown that R-DPRs engage in a broad range of

371

protein-protein interactions (Lee et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2016; Yin et al., 2017) and can trigger

372

phase separation of a large set of proteins involved in RNA metabolism and stress granule

373

formation (Boeynaems et al., 2017). Even with 10mers, we similarly observed rapid alterations

374

in the solubility of proteins upon adding R-DPRs to our transport reactions, that sedimented up

375

to 10% of the cellular proteome and was markedly enriched for disordered nucleic acid-binding

376

proteins. Aromatic rings common to many LCD-containing proteins, including FG-Nups, mediate

377

their phase separation properties through cation-pi interactions with arginine residues (reviewed

378

by Banani et al., 2017), and are likely perturbed by the rapid influx of R-DPRs. Indeed, C9orf72

379

R-DPRs have been reported to disrupt phase separation properties of membrane-less

380

organelles (Lee et al., 2016). While our MS analysis did not permit quantitative comparison

381

between PR and GR, by Western blot we did observe varying selectivity for target proteins. Of

382

note, a recent comparison between modifiers of R-DPR toxicity in yeast noted unexpectedly low

383

overlap between GR- and PR-modifiers (Chai and Gitler, 2018), supporting the idea that they

384

may behave differently in a physiologic context.

385

Based on growing evidence that RNA is integral to the solubility of disordered protein

386

assemblies (Maharana et al., 2018; Langdon et al., 2018; Hondele et al., 2019), and polyU RNA

387

can specifically coordinate the liquid liquid phase separation of PR (Boeynaems et al., 2017),

388

we tested the effect of adding total cellular RNA to the transport reaction, and observed dose-

389

dependent rescue. Total protein aggregates were not strongly reduced by the RNA, however

390

significantly less AF488-labeled R-DPRs were observed in the vicinity of the nuclear envelope.

391

Our electrophoretic mobility shift assay shows that a broad range of cellular RNAs can bind to

392

R-DPRs directly, and previous evidence in a purified system showed that synthetic RNAs can

393

facilitate suspension of R-DPRs in a droplet-like state (Boeynaems et al., 2017). The direct

394

sequestration of R-DPRs by RNA could contribute to the reduced deposition of AF488 DPRs

395

along the nuclear envelope, and the beneficial effects on nuclear import. At the same time, RNA

396

could act indirectly to sequester the R-DPRs away from importins, by promoting the solubility of

397

abundant disordered and RNA-binding proteins, thus decreasing aggregate size and increasing

398

the availability of other R-DPR binding sites. While future studies will be needed to fully

399

elucidate the mechanisms of direct and indirect effects of RNA on R-DPRs, our data suggest

400

that, at least in the permeabilized cell model, RNA can mitigate aberrant protein-protein

401

interactions in a functionally meaningful way.

402

In summary, we propose a model in which R-DPRs bind and interfere with nuclear

403

import complex formation in the soluble phase of the nuclear transport reaction. Based on these

404

findings, we speculate that importin β disruption may contribute to pathological protein

405

mislocalization in C9orf72-mediated ALS/FTD, including TDP-43, for which links to downstream

406

neurodegeneration are beginning to be unraveled (Ling et al., 2015; Melamed et al., 2019; Klim

407

et al., 2019). Further investigation is warranted regarding disruption of importin b and other

408

karyopherins in C9orf72 disease models, and the potential for use of RNA-based strategies to

409

mitigate aberrant R-DPR protein-protein interactions.

414

10- and 20-mer dipeptide repeat proteins with C-terminal lysine (for solubility) and cysteine (for

415

fluorescent tagging, i.e. GPGPGPGPGPGPGPGPGPGPKC) were synthesized by Genscript

416

(Nanjing, China) and 21st Century Biochemicals (Marlborough, MA) and verified by mass

417

spectrometry to be free of trifluoroacetic acid adducts. Lyophilized powder was diluted in 0.1x

418

XB’ buffer (5mM sucrose, 10mM KCl, 1 mM HEPES, pH 7.7) and frozen in single use 10 mM

419

aliquots at -80°C after snap freezing in liquid nitrogen.

421

Cloning of recombinant constructs

422

Restriction cloning was used to insert the ORF from pQE-ZZ-RanQ69L (Nachury and Weis,

423

1999) between the BamH1 and HindIII sites in pRSET A, resulting in pRSET ZZ-RanQ69L. The

424

pRSET zzRCC1 was created by inserting the PCR-amplified wild-type (WT) human RCC1 C-

425

terminally of the ZZ-tag in pRSET A. Site-directed mutagenesis and PCR cloning were used to

426

modify Rango-2 (Kalab and Soderholm, 2010) by removing the KPN1 sites from YPet and

427

CyPet (Nguyen and Daugherty, 2005) and replacing the Snurportin-1 IBB with the IBB amplified

428

from human importin α1 (KPNA2). While doing so, the IBB-importin α1 domain was inserted

429

either with (pK44) or without (pK188) flexible GGCGG linkers added between the 5’ and 3’ ends

430

of IBB and the fluorophores. Restriction cloning was used to combine the C-terminal biotin

431

acceptor peptide tag Avitag (GLNDIFEAQKIEWHE) from pAC-6 (Avidity, Aurora, CO) with WT

432

human importin β (Chi et al., 1997) in pRSET A vector, resulting in in pRSET importin β-Avitag

433

(pKW1982; pK1099). Restriction cloning in the modified pRSET A with C-terminal Avitag was

434

used to create pRSET-EGFP-Avitag (pK803). The pGEX-2TK1 plasmid for the expression of the

435

S. cerevisiae Nsp1(497-608) FxFG domain was obtained from M. Rexach (Yamada et al.,

436

2010).

Recombinant proteins with GFP-derived tags
For expression of proteins containing GFP variants, including Rango (pK44 and pK188),

453

YFP-M9-CFP, GST-GFP-NLS, and GFP-Avitag, the cells were first outgrown at 37°C until

454

reaching OD600nm=0.1-0.3. The cultures were cooled to room temperature (22-25°C), and protein

455

expression was induced at 22-25°C for 12-14 h.

456

Cells expressing 6His-tagged fluorescent proteins (Rango pK44 and pK188, YFP-M9-

457

CFP, and GFP-Avitag) were washed and lysed in 10mM imidazole/PBS and purified with either

458

Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands) or HIS-Select HF Nickel Affinity Gel (Millipore

459

Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The lysates were clarified (40 min, 16000g, 4°C) and incubated with Ni

460

resin (30-60 min, 4°C). The resin was placed into small chromatography columns, washed with

461

ice-cold 10mM imidazole/PBS, and the proteins eluted with increasing concentration of

462

imidazole/PBS (25-300mM). SDS-PAGE was used to select and pool batches with the highest

463

purity, prior to dialysis in PBS or XB buffer (50mM sucrose, 100mM KCl, 10mM HEPES, 0.1 mM

464

CaCl2, 1mM MgCl2, pH 7.7).

465

Cells expressing GST-GFP-NLS were washed and lysed with TBSE (50mM Tris, 150mM

466

NaCl, 4mM EDTA, pH8.0), the lysate clarified, and the protein affinity-purified on glutathione

467

sepharose (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). After washes with TBSE, the proteins were eluted with

TBSE containing increasing concentrations of glutathione (2.5-10 mM). Proteins eluted with 2.5

Full length human importin β was expressed from pET30a-WT Importin β (pKW485; (Chi

et al., 1997)) at the Protein Expression Laboratory (PEL, National Cancer Institute, Frederick,

474

Maryland). The transformed BL21DE3 cells were grown at 37°C in an 80L Bioflow 500

475

bioreactor (New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, NJ) until OD600nm = 0.6, cooled to 22°C and the

476

expression was induced with 0.3mM IPTG. After 12h induction, cells were harvested with the

477

CARR continuous flow centrifuge and lysed in PBS with 10mM imidazole and 5mM TCEP with a

478

110EH Microfluidizer (Microfluidics, Westwood, MA) using 2 passes at 10,000 PSI under chilled

479

conditions. The lysates were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. After thawing,

480

the lysates were clarified and incubated with HIS-Select HF Nickel Affinity beads. The beads

481

were washed with 10mM imidazole/PBS and the protein eluted with 200mM imidazole/PBS

before dialysis in XB. The purified importin β was combined with a freshly thawed aliquot of

483

Rango2-α1 (pK188) at 2.5:1 molar ratio ratio (12.5 µM importin β, 5µM Rango) and

484

supplemented with 3% glycerol. Measurement of Rango fluorescence emission in a

for 4 hours. The cells were washed with PBS, 10mM Imidazole, 1mM MgCl2, 5mM TCEP,

491

0.2mM AEBSF, pH 8.0, and lysed by ice-cold microfluidizer. The clarified lysates were used to

492

isolate the zz-RCC1 proteins on HIS-Select HF Nickel Affinity beads, as described above.

493

Proteins eluted with 0.2M imidazole/PBS were dialyzed in PBS before storage. The zz-

494

RanQ69L (pKW1234; pK1097) was expressed from BL21DE3 cells at PEL in an 80L bioreactor,

495

using conditions described for importin β above, except that expression was induced with

496

0.3mM IPTG at 37°C for 3 hours, and lysis was performed in PBS with 10mM Imidazole, 5mM

497

TCEP, 2mM MgCl2, and 1 mM GTP. The lysates were clarified and bound to HIS-Select HF

Nickel Affinity beads (Millipore Sigma). The Ni resin was washed with ice-cold 10mM

499

imidazole/PBS and the protein eluted with 0.2M imidazole/PBS, followed by dialysis in XB. After

500

measuring the concentration, 60 µM zzRCC1 and 2.4 µM zzRCC1 were combined in XB

501

containing 2mM GTP. Before aliquoting and storage, the measurement of Rango fluorescence

Importin β biotinylation
To prepare biotinylated WT importin β-Avitag (pKW1982, pK1099), BL21DE3 cells (New

507

England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) were co-transfected with the respective plasmids together with

508

pAC-biotin ligase (Avidity), followed by plating and growth in LB media containing ampicillin and

509

chloramphenicol. After the 37°C cultures reached OD600nm + 0.4-0.6, the cultures were cooled to

510

room temperature, supplemented with 100µM D-biotin, and the expression was induced with

511

0.3mM IPTG at room temperature for 8-11 hours (pKW762). Proteins were purified on Ni-NTA

512

resin as described for the non-biotinylated importin β fragments.

The expression of GST- Nsp1(497-609) in BL21(DE3) cells grown in LB media was induced

516

at OD600nm= 0.4-0.6, followed by incubation at 37°C for 3-5 hours. The GST-tagged S. cerevisiae

517

pGEX-Nup100(1-307), Nup100(1-610), Nup116(348-458) and Nup116(348-458) F>A were expressed in T7

518

Shuffle cells (NEB) that were grown in Dynamite media (Taylor et al., 2017) until OD600nm= 0.9

519

before induction with IPTG at 37°C for 3 hours. All the GST-tagged Nup fragments were purified

520

using glutathione-sepharose affinity chromatography, as described for the GST-GFP-NLS

521

above, and dialyzed into PBS before storage.

Importin β labeling with Alexa-647 and BSA biotinylation

525

Purified WT importin β (pKW485) diluted to 10 µM in XB was combined with 10-molar excess of

526

Alexa Fluor 647 NHS ester (ThermoFisher), using freshly-prepared 10mM dye in anhydrous

527

DMSO. After incubation on ice for 2 hours, the sample was dialyzed in PBS and concentrated

528

on 30kD MWCO filter (Millipore Sigma) before storage. A similar protocol was used to label BSA

529

with 10-molar excess Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (ThermoFisher), followed by dialysis in PBS.

530
531

DPR labeling with Alexa-488-maleimide

532

Just before labeling, Alexa Fluor 488 C5-maleimide (ThermoFisher) was diluted to 20 mM in

533

anhydrous DMSO and further diluted to 1.6 mM in XB’ buffer. Freshly thawed 10mM aliquots of

534

DPRs were diluted to 2mM with 0.1x XB’ and combined with an equal volume of 1.6 mM Alexa

535

Fluor 488 C5-maleimide and kept overnight at 4°C. The unreacted maleimide was quenched by

536

1:50 (v/v) 100mM DTT before aliquoting and storage at -80°C. To verify labeling, DPRs were

537

separated by SDS-PAGE followed by fluorescence detection.

538
539

Rango FRET detection

540

FRET assays for DPR-induced dissociation of the importin β-Rango complex were performed

541

using a mix of 5 µM Rango-2/α1 (pK188) and 12.5 µM importin β (pKW485) prepared as

542

described above. After thawing on ice, the mix was diluted to 20 nM Rango and 50 nM importin

543

β in TBS, pH 7.4, 0.005% Tween-20 (TTBS), supplemented with increasing DPR

544

concentrations, and mixed by brief vortexing at low speed. The positive control reactions for

545

RanGTP-induced Rango-importin β dissociation were prepared by adding increasing

546

concentrations of ZZ-RanQ69L-GTP to the samples, using a freshly thawed aliquot of 60 µM

547

ZZ-RanQ69L, 2.4µM ZZ-RCC1, 2mM GTP in XB. The assay buffer alone was used as a blank.

548

A Fluoromax-2 spectrometer (Jobin Yvon Horiba, Piscataway, NJ) was used to detect the

549

Rango emission spectra (460-550nm, in 1nm increments) while exciting the samples at 435nm.

550

The excitation and emission bandpass were set to 5nm and integration time to 0.05s. Peak

551

emissions were recorded at 480nm (donor) and 535nm (acceptor) in all samples, and

552

background emission subtracted at the same wavelengths in the blank. The FRET signal was

553

calculated as the ratio of background-subtracted acceptor/donor emissions. The signal detected

554

in the untreated sample (20 nM Rango and 50 nM importin β-only, the lowest FRET), was then

555

subtracted from the resulting values. Prism v6 (Graphpad, San Diego, CA) was used to

556

calculate the non-linear fit with one site-specific binding model while using the D’Agostino and

557

Pearson K2 test to verify the normality of residuals and the Runs test to assure non-significant

558

deviation from the model.

560

Biochemical pulldown assay for DPR-induced Rango-importin β dissociation

561

An aliquot of 5 µM Rango-2/α1 + 12.5 µM importin β mix was diluted to 20 nM Rango and 50

562

nM importin β in TTBS, supplemented with increasing concentrations of GR10 or PR10, mixed

563

by vortexing, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. GFP-Trap magnetic beads

564

(Chromotek, Planegg-Martinsried, Germany) were washed and resuspended in TTBS. At the

565

end of incubation, 8µl bead suspension was added to each sample and mixed by rotation for 15

566

min. The supernatant was removed and beads washed 3 times with TTBS before boiling in 20µl

567

SDS-PAGE sample buffer with 2% β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE

568

and anti-GFP Western blot performed as detailed below to detect Rango. After detecting the

569

ECL signal, membranes were stained with Coomassie Brilliant R250 to detect importin β.

570

Background-subtracted signals were determined by Image Lab 6.01 (BioRad) and the Rango

571

ECL signal normalized to the importin β signal within each lane.

incubation at room temperature, the samples were supplemented with Fast Digest loading

577

buffer (ThermoFisher; no nucleic acid stain) and separated by electrophoresis on native 1%

578

agarose gel in TBE, alongside with lanes containing HEK RNA (3 µg) or RNA ladder mixed with

ChemiDoc XRS+ using UV transillumination to simultaneously visualize the AF488-labeled R-

581

DPRs and SYBR Gold-labeled RNA signals (where added).

583

Bead halo assay

584

The bead halo assay was carried out as described with minor modifications (Patel and Rexach,

585

2008), using 6-8 µM polystyrene beads coated with neutravidin (for biotinylated proteins) or

586

glutathione (for GST-fusion proteins) (Spherotech, Lake Forest, IL). Beads were coated

587

overnight at 4°C at saturating concentrations per manufacturers’ instructions and rinsed 2x in

588

binding buffer (20 mM HEPES [pH 7.4], 150 mM KOAc, 2 mM Mg(OAc)2, 1 mM DTT, 0.1%

589

Tween-20). Immediately prior to the assay, fluorescent bait proteins and beads were combined

590

with 4x EHBN (40 mM EDTA, 2% 1,6-hexanediol, 40 mg/ml BSA, 500 mM NaCl) to a total of 40

591

µL per well, in optical glass-bottom 96 well plates (Cellvis, Mountain View, CA). Reactions were

592

allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for a minimum of 30 minutes prior to imaging at 100x

593

on an LSM800 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Intensity profiles

594

comparing the maximum rim intensity to the background were plotted in ImageJ (NIH) by an

602

Neurobasal supplemented with B27, Glutamax, and penicillin/streptomycin

603

(Gibco/ThermoFisher). At 5-7 days in vitro, neurons were rinsed in prewarmed PBS and

604

permeabilized for 4 min. at 37° in a hypotonic solution containing 0-40 µM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 (to

605

cause osmotic swelling) and 50-150 mg/ml BSA (for molecular crowding/mechanical support).

606

Following permeabilization, cells were placed on ice and rinsed 2 x 5 minutes in transport buffer

607

(TRB, 20mM HEPES, 110mM KOAc, 2mM Mg(OAc)2, 5mM NaOAc, 0.5mM EGTA, 250mM

608

sucrose, pH 7.3, with protease inhibitor cocktail). All rinse and assay buffers were supplemented

609

with 50 mg/mL BSA. The optimal hypotonic buffer and BSA concentration varied by batch, and

610

was optimized prior to each set of assays for ability to permeabilize the majority of plasma

611

membranes while maintaining nuclear exclusion of a 70 kD fluorescent dextran (ThermoFisher).

612
613

HeLa cell culture and permeabilization

614

A single cell-derived clone of HeLa cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA; mycoplasma negative and

615

validated by STR profiling) were maintained in OptiMEM (Gibco/ThermoFisher) with 4% FBS

616

and plated on uncoated optical glass-bottom 96 well plates, at appropriate densities to reach 70-

617

90% confluence on the day of the transport assay. To permeabilize, cells were rinsed for 2

618

minutes in ice-cold PBS, and permeabilized on ice for 10 minutes in 15-30 µg/mL digitonin

619

(Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) in permeabilization buffer (PRB, 20mM HEPES, 110mM KOAc,

620

5mM Mg(OAc)2, 0.5mM EGTA, 250mM sucrose, pH 7.5, with protease inhibitor cocktail).

621

Following permeabilization, cells were placed on ice and rinsed 3 x 5 minutes in transport buffer

(TRB, 20mM HEPES, 110mM KOAc, 2mM Mg(OAc)2, 5mM NaOAc, 0.5mM EGTA, 250mM

623

sucrose, pH 7.3, with protease inhibitor cocktail). The optimal digitonin concentration varied by

624

cell density and passage number, and was optimized prior to each set of assays for the ability to

625

permeabilize the majority of plasma membranes while maintaining nuclear exclusion of a 70 kD

626

fluorescent dextran (ThermoFisher).

Nuclear import assays

629

Assay components:

630

Nuclear import was carried out essentially as described (Adam et al., 1990) with modified

631

sucrose-containing buffers (Zhu et al., 2015). Concentrated whole cell lysates were prepared

632

from HEK293T cells (ATCC, mycoplasma negative and validated by STR profiling), grown in

633

150 mm dishes and sonicated on ice in 1X TRB in the presence of protease inhibitor cocktail

634

(Roche). The lysates were clarified (15 min, 14000g, 4C), snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and

635

stored in single use aliquots at -80C. Total HEK cell RNA was extracted using miRNEasy kits

636

according to the manufacturers’ protocol, with DNase digestion (Qiagen). RNA concentration

637

was measured by Nanodrop (ThermoFisher), and all 260/280 ratios were verified to be >2.0.

638

Energy regeneration (ER) mix consisted of 100 µM ATP, 100 µM GTP, 4 mM creatine

639

phosphate, and 20 U/mL creatine kinase (Roche).

640
641

Standard assay setup:

642

Reaction mixes consisting of 2.5 mg/ml lysate, ER, fluorescent cargo (200 nM Rango and YFP-

643

M9-CFP, 500 nM GST-GFP-NLS), Hoechst, DPRs, RNA, or inhibitors (100 µM importazole

644

(IPZ, Millipore Sigma); 0.8 mg/mL wheat germ agglutinin (WGA, Millipore Sigma) were

645

assembled on ice during cell permeabilization. DPRs or inhibitors were allowed to equilibrate in

646

cell lysate for at least 30 minutes prior to initiation of transport. Every plate included: (1) Cargo

647

alone: fluorescent cargo, but no ER or lysate, (2) Untreated controls: fluorescent cargo, ER, and

648

lysate, and (3) Inhibitor: fluorescent cargo, ER, lysate, and IPZ (Rango and GST-GFP-NLS

649

reactions) or WGA (YFP-M9-CFP). Preassembled transport reactions were then transferred

650

onto permeabilized cells via multichannel pipette, and allowed to proceed at room temperature

651

for 2 hours (Rango, YFP-M9-CFP) or 4 hours (GST-GFP-NLS). Cells were fixed in 4%

652

paraformaldehyde/PBS, rinsed 2x with PBS, and transferred to 50% glycerol/PBS for immediate

653

imaging.

654

Variations:

655

For a subset of neuron transport assays, transport was monitored live via time lapse imaging

656

every 5 minutes for 30 minutes. In a subset of HeLa assays, transport reactions were

657

centrifuged before use at 14000g x 15 minutes to separate soluble and insoluble fractions. In

658

another variation, the transport lysate + DPR and ER mix was allowed to preincubate on the

659

permeabilized HeLa cells for at least 30 minutes prior to initiation of transport, rinsed 1x with

660

TRB, and transport initiated with fresh lysate, cargo, and ER.

661
662

Imaging and data analysis:

663

Multiple non-overlapping fields per well (4 for time-lapse imaging, 9-16 for fixed imaging), were

664

captured at 40x on an ImageXpress Micro XLS high-content microscope (Molecular Devices,

665

San Jose, CA), and the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic fluorescence intensity was calculated

666

using the MetaXpress automated translocation-enhanced module. Raw data were filtered to

667

exclude autofluorescence and the mean N/C ratio from wells without ER or cell lysate was

668

subtracted from all values. Resulting N/C ratios were expressed as % untreated, to permit

669

comparisons across biological replicates.

670
671

Passive import assays

672

HeLa cells were permeabilized as above, rinsed 3 x TRB, and reaction mix containing 2.5 mg/ml

673

HEK lysate, ER (to mimic the active import conditions), Hoechst, and/or DPRs were added and

674

allowed to preincubate directly on the permeabilized cells for at least 30 minutes. 0.8 mg/ml

675

WGA was used as a positive control. Cells were mounted on a Zeiss LSM800 confocal

676

microscope, reaction mix withdrawn, and immediately replaced with fluorescent dextran

677

(ThermoFisher) or recombinant GFP (pK803) in fresh lysate/ER mix to initiate the passive

678

import reaction. A single 40x frame (containing 20-30 cells/well) was imaged per well, with

679

images collected every 10 seconds for 5 min. The ratio of nuclear fluorescence intensity to local

background at each timepoint was analyzed using Imaris (Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland), and

681

values for each cell were expressed as a ratio of time 0 (1 = no influx, >1 = influx).

682
683

Mass spectrometry

684

50 µM GR10 or 25 µM PR10 (in duplicate) were added to 5 mg/ml HEK whole cell lysate (in

685

TRB with ER), incubated for 60 min at 37°C and aggregates were pelleted by centrifugation at

686

16000g for 10 min. Supernatants were removed and pellets washed 2x and resuspended in

687

MgCl2- and CaCl2- free DPBS (ThermoFisher), then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at

688

-80°C before further processing and analysis by the Johns Hopkins Mass Spectrometry and

689

Proteomics core facility. Pellets were reduced/alkylated with DTT/IAA, reconstituted in

690

TEAB/acetonitrile, and sonicated for 15 min prior to overnight digestion with Trypsin/LysC

691

(Promega, Madison, WI) at 37°C. Some precipitate remained; supernatants were desalted and

692

analyzed by LC/MS/MS on a QExactive_Plus mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher). MS/MS

693

spectra were searched via Proteome Discoverer 2.2 (ThermoFisher) with Mascot 2.6.2 (Matrix

694

Science, London, UK) against the RefSeq2017_83_ human species database (NCBI). Protein

695

probabilities were assigned by the Protein Prophet algorithm (Nesvizhskii et al., 2003). Protein

696

identifications were accepted if they contained at least 2 identified peptides at false discovery

697

rate less than 1.0%. Gene ontology analysis was carried out using the DAVID algorithm v6.8

698

(May 2016, https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) (Huang et al., 2009a;b). The mass spectrometry data have

699

been uploaded to the ProteomeXchange Consortium

700

(http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org) via the PRIDE partner repository (Vizcaino et al.,

701

2013), dataset identifier pending.

702
703

DPR aggregation assay and Western blots

704

Supernatant and pellet fractions (for all 5 DPRs, and control/buffer only) were prepared as in the

705

nuclear transport assays, by adding 100 µM 10mers to 2.5 mg/ml HEK lysate in 100 µL TRB.

706

Supernatants were boiled in Laemmli (BioRad) for 5 minutes. Pellets were boiled for 15 minutes

707

followed by sonication in order to fully disperse aggregates for SDS-PAGE. Equal volumes of

708

supernatant and pellet fractions were run on 4-12% Bolt Bis-Tris Plus gels (ThermoFisher),

709

transferred to nitrocellulose membrane using an iBlot2 dry blotting system (ThermoFisher).

710

Protein loading was analyzed by BLOT-Faststain (G-biosciences, St. Louis, MO), according to

711

the manufacterers’ instructions. For immunodetection, membranes were blocked with 5% non-

712

fat milk in TBST and probed by sequential incubation with the primary antibodies as detailed in

713

the table below. Detection was by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies/chemiluminescence

714

using an ImageQuant LAS 4000 system (GE, Chicago, IL). To permit sequential probing of

715

membranes without stripping, signals were quenched by incubation with prewarmed 30% H202

716

for 20 minutes (Sennepin et al., 2009). Band intensities were measured by ImageQuant

717

software. For pellet vs. supernatant fractions, all were expressed as percent untreated control.

718

For blots in figure 1E, samples were run on 4-20% SDS PAGE minigels (ThermoFisher and

719

blotted to PVDF membranes (Immun-Blot PVDF, Bio-Rad) using the Bio-Rad TransBlot Turbo

720

apparatus, and probed as above. The chemiluminescence signal was captured with a Bio-Rad

721

ChemiDoc XRS+ digital imaging system.

722
723

Statistical analysis

724

Data analysis, graphing, and statistical analyses were carried out using Prism v6-v8
