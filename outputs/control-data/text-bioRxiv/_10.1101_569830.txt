Biological diversity is being lost at unprecedented rates, with admixture and introgression presenting major

16

threats to species' conservation. To this end, our ability to accurately identify introgression is critical to manage

17

species, obtain insights into evolutionary processes, and ultimately contribute to the Aichi Targets developed

18

under the Convention on Biological Diversity. A case in hand concerns roan antelope, one of Africa's most iconic

19

large mammal species. Despite their large size, these antelope are sensitive to habitat disturbance and

20

interspecific competition, leading to the species being listed as Least Concern but with decreasing population

21

trends, and as extinct over parts of its range. Molecular research identified the presence of two evolutionary

22

significant units across their sub-Saharan range, corresponding to a West African lineage and a second larger

23

group which includes animals from East, Central and Southern Africa. Within South Africa, one of the remaining

24

bastions with increasing population sizes, there are a number of West African roan antelope populations on

25

private farms, and concerns are that these animals hybridize with roan that naturally occur in the southern

26

African region. We used a suite of 27 microsatellite markers to conduct admixture analysis. Our results

27

unequivocally indicate evidence of hybridization, with our developed tests able to accurately identify F1, F2 and

28

non-admixed individuals at threshold values of qi = 0.20 and qi = 0.15, although further backcrosses were not

29

always detectable. Our study is the first to confirm ongoing hybridization in this iconic African antelope, and we

30

provide recommendations for the future conservation and management of this species.

Introduction

37

The increased rate of human-driven global change is a major threat to biodiversity [1]. Factors such as climate

38

change, habitat fragmentation, and environmental degradation are influencing the distribution and abundance of

39

species, often in ways that are impossible to predict [2]. Thus, a central theme in conservation biology is how

40

best to manage for species persistence under rapidly changing and often unpredictable conditions. When faced

41

with environmental change, species may persist by moving (or being moved) to track suitable environments.

42

Although there is sufficient evidence to suggest that species notably alter their ranges [3], facilitation of such

43

movement for larger vertebrate species (through the creation of habitat corridors, transfrontier parks or

44

translocations) often place insurmountable burdens on conservation agencies that are ultimately responsible for

45

the management of these populations. Notwithstanding, signatory countries to the Convention on Biological

46

Diversity have an obligation to manage and protect biodiversity, as also set out more recently in the Aichi

47

Biodiversity Targets .

48
49

Admixture and introgression are major threats to species conservation (these threats are dealt with specifically

50

under Aichi Target 13; see https://www.cbd.int/sp/targets/). The ability to accurately identify introgression is

51

critical to the management of species [4–9], and may provide unprecedented insights into evolutionary

52

processes. Although admixture, or even genetic rescue, may have beneficial outcomes through the introduction

53

of new alleles into small or isolated populations, it can lead to outbreeding depression essentially disrupting

54

locally adapted gene-complexes [10–13]. Because of the movement of animals (either natural or human-

55

facilitated), admixture and the effects thereof become increasingly more important to understand and manage.

56
57

Roan antelope (Hippotragus equinus) is one of Africa's most iconic large antelope species. It has a sub-Saharan

58

range, is a water-dependant species, and prefers savanna woodlands and grasslands. [14] recognised six

59

subspecies namely H. e. equinus, H. e. cottoni, H. e. langheldi, H. e. bakeri, H. e. charicus, and H. e. koba based

60

on morphological analyses. However, subsequent genetic studies by [15] and [16] provided less support for

61

these subspecies designation. Although the [15] study included relatively few specimens (only 13 animals were

62

available at the time), [16] analyzed 137 animals sampled from across the range (the only subspecies not

63

included in this study was H. e. bakeri) for both the mtDNA control region and eight microsatellite markers. Both

64

the mtDNA control region and microsatellite data provided strong support for a separation between the West

65

Africa population (corresponding to the H. e. koba subspecies) and those from East, Central and Southern Africa

66

(representing the H. e. equinus, H. e. langheldi, and H. e. cottoni subspecies). Although some differentiation

67

between East, Central and Southern African roan antelope was evident from the mtDNA data, the different

68

subspecies did not form monophyletic groups, with no differentiation observed for the microsatellite data. The

69

placement of the two specimens from Cameroon (corresponding to the H. e. charicus subspecies) were unclear,

70

and the small sample size precluded robust analyses. Based on these results, [16] argued that two evolutionary

71

significant units should be recognized for roan antelope in Africa, corresponding to a West African lineage and an

72

East, Central and Southern African lineage.

73
74

Roan antelope is listed as Least Concern, but with decreasing population sizes, notably in East and Southern

75

Africa [17]. In Southern Africa, roan antelope numbers have dramatically declined in Botswana, Namibia and

76

Zimbabwe and these animals have been eliminated from large parts of their former range including Angola and

77

Mozambique [18]. Within South Africa, roan antelope numbers in reserves and protected areas are critically low,

78

with the majority of animals residing under private ownership on game farms. Indeed, the estimated population

79

size of wild and naturally occurring roan antelope in protected areas in South Africa is less than 300 animals [19],

80

yet indications are that roan antelope is thriving on private land. Current estimates suggest that at least 3,500

81

individuals are managed on private farms [20], with numbers increasing due to these animals being considered

82

an economically important species by the South African wildlife industry. In the 1990s, a number of roan antelope

83

(approximately 40) was imported into South Africa under permit from West Africa. Subsequent to their import,

84

and based on DNA evidence [16], an embargo was placed on the trade of West African animals in South Africa.

85

Recent anecdotal evidence suggested that animals of West African decent was being traded in (based on

86

mitochondrial haplotypes; Jansen van Vuuren, pers. comm.), thereby presenting a real and significant threat to

87

the genetic integrity of roan antelope in South Africa, notwithstanding legislation prohibiting it. Furthermore,

88

animals are sometimes being exported to other Southern African countries, further endangering regional gene

89

pools.

90
91

Our aim here is to expand on the limited and non-specific suite of microsatellite markers employed by [16] to

92

specifically test the validity of these anecdotal reports of trade in West African roan. Also, we assessed the ability

93

of these markers to discriminate between non-admixed animals and hybrid offspring (F2, F3, and F4). Our results

94

will not only confirm whether suggestions of hybridization are true, but will also provide a valuable tool to ensure

95

genetic integrity in the conservation of roan antelope in Southern Africa.

Materials and Methods

98

Sampling

99

Blood, tissue or hair material was obtained from private breeders and game farm owners throughout South Africa

100

(Table 1). Reference samples were selected from the [16] study and represent animals of confirmed provenance.

101

A total of 32 West African roan antelope (populations from three farms in Limpopo Province, South Africa), and

102

98 animals representing the East, Central and Southern African ESU (populations from two farms in the Northern

103

Cape and North West provinces, South Africa) were included. In addition, eight known hybrids and 15 putative

104

hybrids were included in this study (Table 1), provided to us by game owners that legally had West African roan

105

on their farms. Ethical approval was obtained from the Animal Research Ethics Committee, University of the Free

106

State, South Africa (UFS-AED2017/0010) and the NZG Research Ethics and Scientific Committee

107

(NZG/RES/P/17/18). Samples were stored in the NZG Biobank and access for research use of the samples was

108

approved under a Section 20 permit from the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, South Africa

109

(S20BB1917).

Microsatellite markers

114

We selected nine cross-species microsatellite markers (HN60, HN02, HN17, HN27, HN113, HN58, HN09, HN12

115

and HN13) that were previously characterised in sable antelope (Hippotragus niger) by Vaz Pinto [7] and 12

116

cross-species microsatellite markers (BM3517, BM203, SPS113, BM1818, OARFCB304, CSSM19, ILST87,

117

BM719, BM757, OARCP26, OARFCB48, INRA006) that were developed for domestic livestock [21–28]. In

118

addition, species-specific microsatellite markers were developed from non-admixed East, Central and Southern

119

African roan using a Next Generation Sequencing approach. The Nextera® DNA Sample Preparation Kit

120

(Illumina, Inc., San Diego, California, USA) was used to create a paired-end library followed by sequencing on

121

the MiSeqTM sequencer (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, California, USA) using 2 x 300 bp chemistry. Library

122

construction and sequencing was carried out at the Agricultural Research Council Biotechnology Platform

123

(Onderstepoort, Gauteng, South Africa). FastQC version 0.11.4 [29] and Trimmomatic version 0.36 [30] were

124

used for quality control of the raw sequence reads. Tandem Repeat Finder version 4.09 [31] was used to search

125

the remaining reads for microsatellite motifs and Batchprimer3 software [32] was used to design primer pairs

126

flanking the repeat regions.

127
128

Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and genotyping

129

DNA extractions were performed using the Qiagen DNeasy® Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden,

130

Germany) following the manufacturer’s protocols. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification was

131

conducted in 12.5 μl reaction volumes consisting of AmpliTaq® DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc)

132

forward and reverse primers (0.5 μM each), and 50 ng genomic DNA template. The conditions for PCR

133

amplification were as follows: 5 min at 95°C denaturation, 35 cycles for 30 sec at 95°C, 30 sec at 50-62°C

134

(primer-specific annealing temperatures) and 30 sec at 72°C, followed by extension at 72°C for 10 min in a

135

T100TM Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. Hercules, CA, USA). PCR products were run against a

136

GenescanTM 500 LIZTM internal size standard on an ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster

137

City, CA, USA). Samples were genotyped using GeneMapper v. 4.0 software (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster

138

City, CA, USA).

141

Understanding the diversity within groups provide valuable information to identify hybrid individuals. To this end,

142

genetic diversity was evaluated for each group separately (the two different ESUs, known hybrids, and putative

143

hybrids). MICRO-CHECKER [33] was used to detect possible genotyping errors, allele dropout and null alleles.

144

The mean number of alleles per locus (A), allelic richness (AR), observed heterozygosity (Ho), unbiased

145

heterozygosity (Hz = expected heterozygosity adjusted for unequal sample sizes) [34] and number of private

146

alleles per reference group (NP) was calculated with GenAlEx 6.5 [35,36]. Arlequin 3.5 [37,38] was used to test

147

for deviations from expected Hardy-Weinberg (HW) proportions of genotypes (Markov Chain length of 105 and

148

100,000 dememorization steps) and to evaluate loci for gametic disequilibrium (with 100 initial conditions

149

followed by ten permutations, based on the exact test described by Guo and Thompson [39]. Associated

150

probability values were corrected for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni adjustment for a significance level of

151

0.05 [40]. In addition, to determine the discriminatory power of the combined loci, the PID was calculated using

152

GenAlEx [35,36]. Finally, inbreeding (FIS) and average pairwise relatedness between individuals within

153

populations was calculated using the R package Demerelate version 0.9-3 (using 1,000 bootstrap replications)

154

[41].

155
156

Population structure and admixture analysis

157

To estimate the degree of genetic differentiation between populations, we performed an analysis of molecular

158

variance (AMOVA) and conducted pairwise FST comparisons among populations in ARLEQUIN version 3.5

159

[37,38]. We used two approaches to assess population structure, namely a Bayesian clustering approach

160

implemented in STRUCTURE version 2.3.4 [42–44] and a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). STRUCTURE

161

was used for the identification of genetic clusters and individual assignment of non-admixed animals as well as

162

putative hybrid individuals and was run using a model that assumes admixture, correlated allele frequencies and

163

without prior population information for five replicates each with K = 1 – 6, with a run-length of 700,000 Markov

164

Chain Monte Carlo repetitions, following a burn-in period of 200,000 iterations. The five values for the estimated

165

ln(Pr (X|K)) were averaged, from which the posterior probabilities were calculated. The K with the greatest

166

increase in posterior probability (ΔK) [45] was identified as the optimum number of sub-populations using

167

STRUCTURE HARVESTER [46]. The membership coefficient matrices (Q-matrices) of replicate runs for the

168

optimum number of sub-populations was combined using CLUMPP version 1.1.2 [47] with the FullSearch

169

algorithm and G′ pairwise matrix similarity statistics. The results were visualized using DISTRUCT version 1.1

170

[48]. From the selected K value, we assessed the average proportion of membership (qi) of the sampled

171

populations to the inferred clusters. Individuals (parental or admixed classes) were assigned to the inferred

172

clusters using an initial threshold of qi > 0.9 [49]. PCA for the complete data set was achieved using the R

173

package Adegent version 2.1.1 [50].

174
175

Maximizing the accuracy of assignments

176

To determine which threshold Q-value (hybridization or admixture index from clustering algorithms like

177

STRUCTURE) would maximize the accuracy of assignment, simulated genotypes were created using

HYBRIDLAB [51]. Genotypes of non-admixed Western roan antelope, and animals from East, Central and

179

Southern Africa (n =30) with qi > 0.90 (from STRUCTURE-based analysis) were used a parental (P1)

180

populations to create the simulated hybrid genotypes (see [9]). A dataset consisting of 180 individuals were

181

created consisting of 30 each belonging to non-admixed Western roan antelope, non-admixed Eastern, Central

182

and Southern roan antelope, F1 hybrids, F2 hybrids, backcrosses of F1 with Western roan (BC-Western roan)

183

and backcrosses of F1 with rest of Africa roan antelope (BC-rest of Africa roan). The simulated dataset was

184

analysed with STRUCTURE version 2.3.4 [42–44] using the admixed model, correlated allele frequencies and

185

without prior population information for five replicates each with K = 1 – 2, a run-length of 700,000 Markov Chain

Monte Carlo repetitions and a burn-in period of 200,000 iterations.

Species-specific microsatellite markers

190

In this study, species specific microsatellite markers were successfully developed using DNA extracted from non-

191

admixed roan antelope (i.e., animals of known provenance). Read lengths of 2 x 301 bp (2 x 3,306,938) were

192

obtained and after trimming, the remaining reads ranged from 180 to 200 bp (2 x 1,596,026). A total of 14 unique

193

loci were identified, of these only six were polymorphic and consistently amplified animals from both ESUs (Table

194

found exclusively in the East, Central and Southern African group (Table 3). An analysis of molecular variance

203

(AMOVA) unequivocally retrieved the two distinct groups (corresponding to the two ESUs reported by Alpers

204

[16]; FST = 0.165, P < 0.001), validating our two reference groups. Principle component analysis similarly

205

revealed a clear separation between the West African versus East, Central and Southern Africa roan (Fig 1A).

206

The two distinct genetic clusters (K = 2) was supported by the Bayesian assignment analysis (Fig 1B, S1 Fig).

207

West African versus East, Central and Southern African roan antelope were assigned to two distinct clusters with

208

individual coefficient of membership (qi) for non-admixed Western roan qi > 0.881 and for non-admixed East,

209

Central and Southern Africa roan qi > 0.883. With regards to known hybrids, six of the eight known hybrids were

210

confirmed as hybrids, with two hybrids being identified as non-admixed Western roan (qi = 0.9664 and qi =

211

0.9510, respectively). Analysis of putative hybrids identified four out of 15 animals as hybrid (27%).

On South African farms, game owners often employ selective breeding to achieve specific outcomes. For

221

example, hybrid animals may be backcrossed with pure roan to selectively breed hybrid lineages back to pure; in

222

theory this can be achieved in N = 4 generations. We wanted to assess whether our markers are able to detect

223

backcrossed animals, especially in the F3 and F4 generations. In this study, we created a simulated dataset to

224

maximize the accuracy of assignment to distinguish between the two non-admixed groups (West Africa versus

225

East, Central and Southern roan antelope), F1 hybrids, F2 hybrids, F1 BC-Western roan and F1 BC-rest of Africa

226

roan. STRUCTURE analysis of simulated genotypes generated by HYBRIDLAB indicated that all (100%) of the

227

West African roan versus East, Central and Southern Africa roan, F1 and F2 genotypes were correctly assigned

228

at thresholds of qi > 0.80 and qi > 0.85 (Table 4). At a threshold value of qi > 0.90, all F1, F2 hybrid and the East,

229

Central and Southern Africa roan were correctly assigned, however, 20% of the non-admixed Western roan

230

would be incorrectly identified as hybrid origin. At a threshold value of qi > 0.95, all F1 and F2 hybrid individuals

231

would be correctly assigned, however, 40% of non-admixed Western roan and 7% of the East, Central and

232

Southern African roan would be incorrectly identified as hybrid. Our ability to distinguish non-admixed roan from

233

backcrossed individuals may be problematic in some instances with correct assignment of backcrossed Western

234

roan individuals varying from 40% at qi > 0.80 to 97% at qi > 0.95, and backcrossed East, Central and Southern

235

African roan individuals varying from 53% at qi > 0.80 to 97% at qi > 0.95. Based on the simulation results, the

236

threshold q-value of qi >0.85 was selected for analysis of the non-admixed parental populations, known hybrids

237

and putative hybrids.

Genetic diversity and relatedness

245

Deviations from HWE equilibrium were not consistent across populations, with significant deviations from HWE

246

being observed only in the East, Central and Southern African roan populations. In the East, Central and

247

Southern Africa roan population A (Northern Cape Province), 11 loci (BM3517, BM719, OARFCB48, CSSM19,

248

BM1818, BM757, SPS113, INRA006, OARFCB304, RAO4116 and HN27) deviated from HWE. In addition, two

249

loci (BM3517 and SPS113) deviated from HWE in East, Central and Southern Africa roan population B (North

250

West Province) following Bonferroni correction. These markers indicated significant heterozygote deficit in the

251

respective populations with Ho values lower than He values, which may be an indication of the presence of

252

possible null alleles. However, null alleles were only observed in six markers (BM3517, BM719, SPS113,

253

INRA006, RAO4116 and HN27) from the East, Central and Southern African roan group. Significant linkage

254

disequilibrium (LD) was also observed only in the East, Central and Southern African group. These departures

255

from equilibrium may be because of substructure in this group (see [16], which described three mitochondrial

256

DNA groups within this larger ESU), or because of inbreeding. To further investigate the possible causes of

257

heterozygote deficiency, we estimated the overall inbreeding coefficient per population with positive estimates

258

only being observed in the East, Central and Southern African roan group (F = 0.102). In addition, analysis of the

259

overall population relatedness was conducted, as mating among close relatives may cause heterozygote

260

deficiency. As shown in Fig 2, the overall population relatedness was higher in the East, Central and Southern

261

African roan group (average = 74%) compared to the West African animals (average = 39%).

Genetic diversity for each population is summarized in Table 5. Overall, the genetic diversity in the Western roan

268

populations is higher compared to populations from the East, Central and Southern African ESU, notwithstanding

269

smaller sample sizes. The mean number of alleles (A) ranged from 4.15 - 6.07 and 4.26 - 5.70, while allelic

270

richness (AR) ranged from 3.17 - 4.18 and 2.97 - 3.17 in the reference West African group, and East, Central

271

and Southern African roan groups respectively. Observed heterozygosity (Ho) in the Western roan group ranged

272

from 0.67 - 0.72 and unbiased heterozygosity (Hz) from 0.65 - 0.71 while Ho in the East, Central and Southern

273

African roan varied from 0.57 - 0.63 and Hz from 0.605 - 0.609. The PID for the 27 loci was 5.5-20, thus the

estimated probability of any two individuals by chance alone sharing the same mulitlocus genotype is 1.819 for

275

the 27 loci combined.

Discussion
An increasing number of species experience dramatic declining population numbers globally, with ample
evidence suggesting that we are entering a mass extinction event. Although the drivers of these population
declines are numerous and varied, the underlying root cause inevitably stems from anthropogenic pressures. Not
surprisingly, hybridization and admixture of groups with distinct evolutionary trajectories are increasing, raising
concerns about the integrity of a large number of species, especially those that experience disproportionately
large human interest. For roan antelope, one of Africa's most spectacular large antelope species, this is certainly
the case. Although roan antelope numbers are increasing in South Africa (largely because of protection under
private ownership), real concerns exist about their genetic integrity given admixture with West African roan
antelope, also for export to neighbouring countries. We discuss our results here, and provide some suggestions
for roan antelope conservation in South Africa.
Evidence of hybridization
Using a suite of variable and informative microsatellite markers, we provide unequivocal evidence of
hybridization and introgression between roan antelope naturally occurring in South Africa (East, Central and
Southern African origin), and those of West African decent (a separate evolutionary significant unit; see [16]).
More problematic, the identification of first and second generation backcrosses with q-values close to threshold
values strongly suggest that hybrid individuals are viable and fertile; as also suggested from anecdotal evidence
from some game farms. Although genetic diversity estimates were moderately higher in the known and putative
hybrid individuals, it has previously been reported that F2 hybrids can display reduced fitness as a result of
disruption of sets of co-adapted gene complexes by recombination [52,53], thereby weakening the entire gene
pool of naturally occurring individuals. Our marker set was able to accurately identify F1 and F2 hybrids, as well
as non-admixed individuals at thresholds of q = 0.20 and q = 0.15. However, the accurate classification of further
backcrosses was less accurate at these thresholds (40% to 83%) with backcrossed individuals being incorrectly
classified as non-admixed. The use of higher thresholds (qi = 0.10 and qi = 0.05) did increase the number of
individuals correctly classified as backcrosses, however, this also resulted in an increase in the number of nonadmixed individuals being incorrectly classified as hybrids. Thus in certain instances, backcrossed and double
backcrossed individuals extend beyond the detection power of the current microsatellite marker panel.
The minimum number of markers required to accurately and consistently identify backcrosses is currently being
debated. Simulation analysis in the grey wolf (Canis lupus) that hybridizes with domestic dogs (C. lupus
familiaris) indicated that simply increasing the number of microsatellite markers used does not equate to an
increase in the number of correctly identified admixed individuals [54]. It may be important to evaluate single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with high discriminating power to increase the ability to detect backcrossed
and double backcrossed individuals, but in all likelihood thousands of SNPs may be required. Notwithstanding,
the marker set described here represents the first step in assessing hybridization in roan antelope, and in the
identification of hybrid individuals.

Conservation management
As signatories to the Convention on Biological Diversity, South Africa has an obligation to conserve the genetic
integrity of its biological diversity. Furthermore, admixture between distinct wildlife subspecies is prohibited under
national and provincial legislation. Within South Africa, wildlife can be privately owned. There has been some
debate about the legal rights of an owner to act in a certain manner with its property, and whether farming with
wildlife should be managed and regulated any differently than, for example, agricultural stock such as cattle.
Notwithstanding, current international, national and provincial legislation is clear in prohibiting admixture,
irrespective of ownership.
The private ownership of biological diversity has been advantages for a large number of species, and the high
commercial value attached to many of these species has undoubtedly aided in their conservation and protection;
to the point where a number of species are doing better under private ownership compared with in protected
areas or national parks [55]. Roan antelope is a prime example, but others include sable antelope, white and
black rhinoceros, and bontebok to name but a few. Unfortunately, many of these species are intensively
managed, with selection for specific desired traits. These management practises have unintended
consequences, notably a loss of genetic diversity. In our study, a number of loci showed deviations from HWE
and linkage disequilibrium; all which can be ascribed to small numbers of founding individuals and genetic drift
on farms [56] which may, in the long term, compromise local adaptation [57]. To fully understand the impact that
farming practises, notably intensive management and selection, have on wildlife populations, comparisons need
to be done with naturally occurring populations on nature reserves.
Currently, the full extent of hybridization in South Africa between roan antelope belonging to the two distinct
ESUs is unknown. Laboratory screening for permitting purposes (to either sell, or translocate animals) suggest
that the occurrence of widespread introgression is low, and largely confined to specific game farms.
Animals of West African decent are no longer maladapted to South African conditions and have, over the span of
20 years, adapted to local conditions. The question that needs consideration is whether South Africa should
safeguard the genetic integrity and genetic variability of both roan ESUs. If historic occurrence is considered,
then all West African animals should be removed from South African populations. However, the South African
situation has spawned several ex situ breeding programmes and agreements and/or animals that could be
allowed to be backcrossed to obtain some form of purity, over four or five generations. This might improve
genetic variation within the national population, but may not be desirable given that the impact of hybridization on
the South African roan full genome is not known. Thus, we recommend the implementation and continuation of
strict genetic monitoring for hybridization in roan antelope in South Africa. With the microsatellite marker set
described here, and using a threshold of qi = 0.15, it is possible to detect F1 and F2 hybrids prior to
translocation, thereby reducing and ultimately eliminating Western roan antelope alleles in the indigenous roan
gene pools. In addition, management of roan in South Africa would benefit from a national meta-population
