Abstract

2

Background: More than 80,000 dengue cases including 215 deaths were reported nationally in less than

3

seven months between 2016-2017, a fourfold increase in the number of reported cases compared to the

4

average number over 2010-2016. The region of Negombo, located in the Western province, experienced

5

the greatest number of dengue cases in the country and is the focus area of our study, where we aim to

6

capture the spatial-temporal dynamics of dengue transmission.

7

Methods: We present a statistical modeling framework to evaluate the spatial-temporal dynamics of the

8

2016-2017 dengue outbreak in the Negombo region of Sri Lanka as a function of human mobility, land-

9

use, and climate patterns. The analysis was conducted at a 1 km × 1 km spatial resolution and a weekly

10

temporal resolution.

11

Results: Our results indicate human mobility to be a stronger indicator for local outbreak clusters than

12

land-use or climate variables. The minimum daily temperature was identified as the most influential

13

climate variable on dengue cases in the region; while among the set of land-use patterns considered, urban

14

areas were found to be most prone to dengue outbreak, followed by areas with stagnant water and then

15

coastal areas. The results are shown to be robust across spatial resolutions.

16

Conclusions: Our study highlights the potential value of using travel data to target vector control within a

17

region. In addition to illustrating the relative relationship between various potential risk factors for dengue

18

outbreaks, the results of our study can be used to inform where and when new cases of dengue are likely

19

to occur within a region, and thus help more effectively and innovatively, plan for disease surveillance

20

and vector control.

1. Background

2

Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that infects approximately 390 million people globally every

3

year, particularly in tropical and subtropical countries (1, 2). The high number of infections combined

4

with the lack, as yet, of a routinely used effective vaccine has made dengue a notorious public health

5

problem (2, 3).

6
7

Dengue spreads through the bite of infected Ades mosquitoes, especially Aedes aegypti– the primary

8

vector, with an estimated 15 to 17-day delay between the primary and secondary human infections (4).

9

Dengue outbreak control is a challenge for policy makers because Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are well

10

adapted to high density urban environments and actively feed during the day (5-7), thus presenting an

11

elevated risk to humans. Urban settings provide an ideal habitat for Aedes aegypti breeding due to an

12

abundance of discarded trash bags, plastic bottles, tires, and other containers that enable the formation of

13

stagnant shallow water surfaces after precipitation (8). Urban regions in developing countries are

14

particularly vulnerable due to a lack of indoor plumbing infrastructure that, in conjunction with a lack of

15

air-conditioning, results in higher human-mosquito exposure rates during the day. Additionally, because

16

of the daytime feeding behaviors of Aedes aegypti, common vector control measures that work for night-

17

biting mosquitoes, such as bed nets, fail to effectively control dengue transmission. Given these

18

challenges, there is a need to better understand and predict dengue outbreaks and transmission risk within

19

urban regions in developing countries so that vector control and surveillance resources can be optimally

20

allocated.

21
22

Previous studies highlighted human mobility as a critical factor for dengue transmission (9-15), which

23

contrasts the more minor role travel plays in the spread of vector-borne diseases transmitted by night-

24

biting mosquitoes (15). While Aedes aegypti mosquitoes have a hard time dispersing geographically

across large areas because they rarely travel more than 400m from where they emerge as adults (16-19),

2

humans regularly travel much longer distances on a daily basis. As new dengue cases and clusters are

3

regularly reported kilometers apart, it is likely that human mobility play a critical role in the spread of

4

dengue outbreaks, i.e., infected humans introduce dengue into new mosquito populations at their trip

5

ends. As an example, Vazquez-Prokopec, Montgomery (12) studied the pattern of dengue transmission

6

using location-based contact tracing on infected dengue patients during a dengue outbreak centered at

7

Cairns, Australia. They collected locations that the patients frequently traveled to during the daytime and

8

2-4 weeks prior to the onset of symptoms through phone interviews. The contact locations with a

9

proximity of 100 meters and a separation of 20 days were spatial-temporally linked into pairs and then

10

chains to identify the plausible sites of dengue virus transmission. They showed that the complex pattern

11

of dengue transmission was primarily driven by human mobility, and that targeted residual spaying could

12

potentially reduce the probability of dengue transmission up to 96%. Their study highlights the

13

importance of understanding dengue transmission patterns to optimize the allocation of dengue prevention

14

and vector-control measures.

15
16

In addition to human mobility, recent studies have pointed to a strong association between climate

17

conditions and dengue outbreaks at various locations and across different temporal resolutions (8, 20-24).

18

Precipitation, mean temperature and temperature fluctuation were revealed to affect the population

19

dynamics of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and the dengue virus extrinsic incubation period (25-29).

20

Specifically, a suitable average temperature and moderate temperature fluctuations are often favorable for

21

dengue transmission (25), while an increase in precipitation is strongly associated with the onset of a

22

dengue outbreak (22). Humidity, a combined effect of precipitation and temperature, is also a common

23

climate index to evaluate the environmental capacity for dengue emergence (20, 21, 30, 31). Wesolowski,

24

Qureshi (13) accounted for both climate and mobility in a study of dengue virus transmission over a large

25

dengue outbreak period in Pakistan. They developed an epidemiological model that included temperature

1

and relative humidity as input parameters for mosquito dynamics, as well as biting rate to capture the

2

interactions between human and mosquito hosts. Human mobility was captured using mobile phone data

3

of ~40 million subscribers to estimate the spatially explicit travel volume, albeit not differentiating

4

infected and non-infected people. They showed that the emergence of dengue epidemics in a new region

5

could be predicted using aggregated travel patterns from endemic areas in combination with the

6

developed epidemiological model. While climatic factors were found to be significant for prediction, this

7

was in part due to the large study region, i.e., country level, which has variable climatic suitability for the

8

mosquito vector. The study region considered in our work is much smaller and has minimal climactic

9

variability, thus alternative methods are required to distinguish site-specific risk.

10
11

Land-use patterns — indicators of human activities and potential breeding habitats — have also been

12

linked to dengue outbreaks (32-37). Previous studies investigated the effect of land-use patterns on the

13

spread of dengue and found that human settlements, water bodies, and mixed horticulture are the top three

14

associated land-use patterns for dengue emergence in Malaysia (35). In another study (36), areas

15

surrounded by rice paddies and marshes/swamps were associated with a significantly higher population of

16

dengue vectors during the rainy season in Thailand. Orchards (which often contain artificial water

17

containers) and irrigation fields have also been shown to play an important role in dengue infections;

18

however, their role varies given different local conditions. Sometimes, land-use type can be a proxy for

19

other features, such as socio-economic factors, which may have a contradictory effect on dengue

20

infections (37).

21
22

In this study, we present a statistical modeling framework to evaluate the relative role of human travel

23

patterns, climate conditions, and land-use patterns on dengue outbreak dynamics in Negombo, Sri Lanka

24

(Figure 1), where dengue outbreaks are increasing in scale and prevalence. Dengue has been endemic in

Sri Lanka since 1960s, and all four serotypes circulate in the region (38). Dengue hemorrhagic fever

2

(DHF) cases were rare until 1989, when the first major dengue outbreak occurred with approximately 200

3

cases and 20 deaths; DHF has since become endemic in the country (38-40). The 2017 outbreak involved

4

many severe DHF cases, with evidence showing a dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) being the causative

5

serotype (41, 42). DENV-2 had only be detected infrequently over the recent decades of dengue

6

epidemics and is therefore associated with low immunity in the region (38). As a result, more than 80,000

7

dengue cases including 215 deaths were reported nationally in less than seven months between 2016-

8

2017, a fourfold increase in the number of reported cases compared to the average number over 2010-

9

2016 (43). The region of Negombo, located in the Western province, experienced the greatest number of

10

dengue cases in the country; approximately 45% of the cases nationwide by July 2017 (Figure 1), and is

11

the focus area of our study.

12
13

We applied a mixed-effects model, where the mobility data bridges the time-varying, spatially-invariant

14

climate variables and the rasterized spatially explicit, time-invariant population and land-use variables, to

15

capture the spatial-temporal dynamics of dengue transmission. Our model framework differs from

16

previous studies that simulated the transmission process (12, 13, 44), and instead focuses on estimating

17

the timing and location of new case introductions though a non-process based statistical model.

18

Specifically, we focus on modeling the home locations of (newly infected) dengue patients, and assume

19

dengue is introduced in new areas by infected individuals who travel to the area. This assumption is

20

consistent with previous studies that have shown visits to a household by infected people determines the

21

infection risk in that household (11). In addition, the study was conducted at a fine-grained spatial and

22

temporal resolution — 1 km × 1 km spatially and one week temporally — providing an improved

23

understanding of the role of mobility in the spread of dengue. While previous work studied the impact of

24

mobility (12, 13), climate (8, 20, 22, 25), and land-use (35-37) separately on dengue, the authors are

25

unaware of any existing study that considers these factors within a single integrated framework. Thus,

previous studies have been unable to quantify the relative contribution of each factor on the spatial-

2

temporal patterns of dengue transmission as we do. The results from our study indicate that mobility is a

3

more significant indicator of new dengue case clusters compared with land-use and climate factors.

Furthermore, the case study in Sri Lanka provides critical insights into effective application of dengue

5

prevention and vector control measures in developing regions.

2. Methods

2

A statistical model is applied to investigate the spatial-temporal dynamics of dengue outbreak with

3

respect to a range of potential explanatory variables. The complete set of potential explanatory variables

4

is listed in Table 1. Detailed descriptions of the data followed by a description of the methodology are

5

provided below.

7

(a) Case and Mobility Data

8

A patient travel survey was conducted among dengue patients in the Negombo region of Sri Lanka over

9

an approximately 8-month period during a major outbreak spanning from end of October 2016 to early

10

July 2017. Geolocation data were collected from all patients admitted to the special High Dependency

11

Unit (HDU) for critically ill dengue patients within the Clinical Centre for Managing Dengue and Dengue

12

Haemorrhagic Fever (CCMDDHF) at the Negombo Hospital in Negombo, Sri Lanka. Specifically, the

13

date of admission, home address, the complete set of locations visited, and corresponding trips made

14

between all locations during the 10-days prior to hospital admission were collected from all HDU

15

CCMDDHF admitted patients for the entire study period. The case data provide spatial-temporal

16

information on the outbreak patterns, while the mobility data collected captures daily travel activity of the

17

admitted dengue patients. The data were collected by trained students and supervised by a Senior House

18

Officer on site. For weekday admissions the patients were surveyed upon admittance, for night

19

admissions data were collected the following day, and for weekend admissions on the following Monday.

20

The majority of admissions were 48 to 72 hours following the onset of fever. Dengue infection was

21

confirmed for the patient set using either NS1 antigen or IgM antibody diagnostic test.

(b) Climate Data

2

We used the Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD) daily weather data (46) from a station in

3

Negombo (Figure 1) to explore the impact of climate factors on the dengue outbreak. The location of the

4

weather station (7.18ºN, 79.87ºE) is approximately in the center of the study region and it is the only

5

station that falls into our study region with a comprehensive set of climate data available during the study

6

period. There are several global reanalysis products that provide spatial-explicit climate data during the

7

study period; however, upon evaluation against the station observations, these globally gridded data sets

8

did not provide accurate representations of the local climate variables, particularly at a daily time-step

9

(Figure S1). Hence, the weather data are assumed to be representative for the region which has relatively

10

homogeneous weather patterns (47). We selected a range of potential climate variables based on previous

11

studies (8, 20-22, 25-31), including daily mean temperature (Tavg), daily maximum temperature (Tmax),

12

daily minimum temperature (Tmin), diurnal temperature range (DTR), precipitation (Pre), the number of

13

raining days (RD), and relative humidity (RH) to analyze climatic influence for the weeks before and

14

during the same period of analysis that the mobility data was collected.

15
16

(c) Population and Land-use Data

17

We used a global population data layer based on Landscan 2016 (48), that is available at an

18

approximately 1 km × 1 km resolution to represent the population distribution spatially. We aggregated

19

the data to 5 km × 5 km grid for additional analysis with a coarser spatial resolution. Land-use data (49)

20

were obtained from the Sri Lanka Survey Department which performed an initial survey in 2000 and has

21

since continuously updated the maps. The map was extracted for our region of interest and reclassified

22

into several groups (Figure 1): Sea, Standing Water (StWtr), Flowing Water (FlwWtr), Coconut, Marsh,

23

Paddy, Built-up (BuiltUp), Scrubland, Homesteads, Forest, Rubber, Rock/Sand (RockS), Other

24

Agriculture (OthAg), and Other. Water bodies were categorized depending on the potential effect on

dengue transmission dynamics. Additional details on land-use classification groupings and processing is

2

available in the supplementary material.

3
4

(d) Data Processing and Statistical Model

5

We divided the study region (Figure 1) into a grid at a 1 km × 1 km resolution and aggregated daily data

6

into a 1-weekly resolution. The number of patients who were admitted to the hospital during each week of

7

the recorded time period was used to generate the weekly number of newly admitted dengue patients in

8

each cell based on their home locations. This becomes our ‘case’ variable.

9
10

To incorporate the role of mobility into the model we used the travel itineraries provided by the patients

11

to generate a time-dependent connectivity matrix, which represented the total number of trips made by

12

dengue infected patients between each pair of cells for each week of the study period. The travel data

13

included all destinations visited each day during the 10 days preceding hospital admittance (the time

14

interval that the patient is assumed to be able to spread the disease) for each patient. The number of daily

15

trips between each pair of cells was summed over all patients, to provide daily trip volumes between cells,

16

and then aggregated to the weekly level. For each cell the total incoming weekly trips was summed to

17

define our ‘trip’ variable. Critically, we exclude all trips with a destination of ‘home’ when computing our

18

trip variable, in order to remove the inherent dependence between the ‘case’ variable, i.e., the home

19

location of infected individuals, and the ‘trip’ variable (explanatory variable). Thus, the total number of

20

trips (excluding trips home) made by infected dengue patients entering a given cell i in a given week t,

21

𝑉𝑡𝑖 , was used as a spatial-temporal explanatory variable in the model. The same method was used for the 5

22

km × 5 km analysis.

1

Climate variables were averaged or aggregated temporally to a weekly resolution, including weekly

2

average Tavg, Tmin, Tmax, DTR, RH, weekly total Pre, and RD. Land-use data were aggregated spatially

3

to match the targeted spatial grid resolution. The population data were in an original resolution that

4

matched the 1 km × 1 km grid. For land-use, the percentage of occupied land of each type was determined

5

for each 1 km × 1km grid cell. Both were subsequently aggregated to a 5 km × 5 km grid.

6

A linear mixed-effects model combined with backward elimination of insignificant fixed effects (p-value

7

> 0.05, two-tail test) was applied to investigate the spatial-temporal dynamics of dengue outbreak with the

8

potential explanatory variables at a weekly time step and 1 km × 1 km spatial resolution. In building the

9

model we first conducted sensitivity analysis to identify the optimal set of climatic variables to include in

10

the model, and corresponding time lag for each of them.

11
12

Along with the chosen climate variable, the remaining set of potential explanatory variables (Table 1) was

13

normalized and then taken into the mixed-effects model initially, with population included in the spatial

14

random effects. Population density was incorporated using random effects in the model because

15

population is likely to have spatially heterogeneous effects on dengue outbreaks (44, 50). For example,

16

high population areas may imply access to tap water and better living conditions which could restrict

17

dengue transmission (51), while the higher density of population facilitates disease spread. Furthermore,

18

there could be spatial variance in the distribution of people living in a particular area. In addition to

19

mobility, climate, and land-use variables; the number of new cases in a given cell in the weeks prior were

20

added as explanatory variables to account for autocorrelations in the case data. Subsequently, the variable

21

with the most insignificant fixed-effects coefficient was eliminated each iteration, until only variables

22

with significant coefficients (at 95% significance level) remained in the model. A range of lead time for

23

𝑉𝑡𝑖 prior to the admitted week was also tested. A separate analogous process was conducted using a 5 km

We performed sensitivity analysis to evaluate the robustness of our model results. Firstly, a Jackknife

17

excluding one week at a time, over the entire time period modeled. The variability in estimated

parameters and their corresponding significance are presented in Supplementary Table S3. Second, we

evaluated the sensitivity of the model to fluctuations of the ‘trip’ variable. The motivation behind this

sensitivity analysis was the uncertainty resulting from potential human error in the ‘trip’ variable, which

is based on the patients’ recollection of their travel in the 10-day prior to hospital admittance. To assess

(a) Data Analysis

7

The number of admitted dengue patients aggregated over the study region peaks during December and

8

June (Figure 2), aligned with the monsoon months (38). Figure 2a illustrates the relationship between the

9

total number of dengue patients, Nt, admitted during each week t and the total number of recorded patient

10

trips (excluding the trips to home) during the same week (Vt). Figure 2b illustrates Nt and the weekly

11

averaged minimum daily temperature in week t (𝑇min𝑡 ). It shows a lagged relationship of Nt with 𝑇min𝑡 ,

12

mostly in the same direction. For the purposes of these graphics, the variables are aggregated over the

13

entire study region.

The travel destinations recorded in our study include medical facilities, homes, workplaces, schools, and

2

others (Figure S3). Additional analysis performed reveals that a vast majority of trips were longer than the

3

distance a mosquito can travel. Specifically, 96.6% of the trips were longer than 0.4 km (Table S1; Figure

4

S4), outside the range of a mosquito’s maximum travel distance (16-19), further supporting the role

5

human mobility is likely to play in the outbreak.

Figure 3 illustrates both the spatial-temporal distribution of dengue patients’ home locations over the

8

course of the outbreak, and the corresponding travel patterns of the patients during 5-week periods,

9

excluding the trips with a destination of ‘home’. The patient home locations were well distributed over

10

the area of the study region for the first few months of the outbreak, with correspondingly scattered travel

11

patterns. However, as the outbreak progressed, the recorded case locations and the trip ends of newly

12

infected dengue patients became more concentrated near the town center and just above the lake. There

13

were also a large number of trips (>50) within the cell near the town center.

(b) Selection of Climate Variables

10

Among the climate variables, significant correlations were observed for weekly averaged Tavg, Tmin, and

11

DTR with a lead time ranging from 7 days to 17 days prior to the weekly admitted number of patients

12

(Nt), where the lead time (dc) is the lag in days between the climate variable and Nt (Figure S2).

13

Regression models based on different combinations of the climate variables and lead time were developed

14

and compared; the best performance model was select based on F-test and adjusted-R2. As a result, Tmin

15

with an optimal lead time of 10 days was included in the final set of mixed-effects models to account for

16

the partial influence of climate on the dengue outbreak (R2 = 0.248; adj. R2 = 0.226). This is consistent

17

with previous findings (29) that daily minimum temperature were associated with increase in the larval

18

abundance. We assumed a relatively homogenous climate over the study region, thus Tmin does not vary

19

spatially over the study region.

20
21

(c) Model Results

22

A mixed-effects model was developed to estimate the number of new dengue cases in a given cell in a

23

given week as a function of the mobility patterns of individuals infected with dengue in the preceding

24

week(s), as well as land-use and climate data from days prior.

Multiple models with explanatory variables representing land-use, climate, and mobility were created,

7

and the three representative models are presented here. The three models vary based on the type of

1

mobility variable included, specifically how far back in time travel is accounted for. The first model

2

includes the mobility patterns one-week prior (u = 1), the second model includes the mobility patterns

3

two-weeks prior (u = 2), and the third model excludes mobility altogether (“Exclude V”). The final set of

4

climate and land-use variables found to be significant varies between models. All explanatory variables

5

were normalized to a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one in the mixed-effects model. The fixed-

6

effects coefficients (Table 2) therefore reflect the relative influence of each explanatory variable on the

7

dengue outbreak dynamics.

8
9

The results (Table 2) for each of the three models are presented for both a 1 km × 1 km and 5 km × 5 km

10

resolution, and reveal that the mobility patterns of dengue patients, specifically the number of trips made

11

into a cell in a given week, to be the most dominant explanatory factor of new dengue cases in that cell

12

the following week. Under the spatial resolution of 1 km × 1 km, the fixed-effects coefficient for the trips

13

one week prior (u = 1) is 0.070, which is greater than the fixed-effects coefficients for other explanatory

14

variables, suggesting human mobility plays a critical role in dengue outbreak dynamics. Results also

15

illustrate a decrease in explanatory power of mobility patterns further than a week in advance, and are

16

insignificant for the trips variable with a lead time of two weeks (u = 2). When mobility data is excluded

17

from the model altogether, the adjusted R2 decreases slightly. In general, the power of the number of trips

18

in predicting dengue cases deteriorates with longer lead time, with the number of trips two-weeks prior

19

showing little or no advantage over other explanatory variables. The same conclusion is applicable for the

20

results under the 5 km × 5 km resolution, as shown in Table 2. These results highlight the importance of

21

collecting and utilizing mobility data within an appropriate timeframe for the purposes of modeling

22

dengue outbreak risk. These conclusions are further supported by the sensitivity analysis, which show the

23

rank and magnitude of the estimated model parameters (and significance) are robust to changes in both

24

the outbreak period and also variability in the trips variable (Figure S6).

Among the seven land-use groups (see variable descriptions in Table 1) under the 1 km × 1 km resolution,

3

only BuiltUp shows significant positive fixed effects on dengue cases (Table 2). Under the coarser spatial

4

rasterization of 5 km × 5 km, StWtr and Sea also show significant positive fixed effects, in addition to

5

BuiltUp. Whereas BuiltUp and StWtr show significant fixed effects in all three models with the

6

coefficients ranging from 0.034 to 0.050 for BuiltUp and 0.026 to 0.032 for StWtr, , Sea shows the

7

significant coefficient of 0.029 only in the model with the trip variable excluded. It indicates that urban

8

areas, areas with standing water, and areas near the coastline are associated with a higher risk of dengue

9

infections; the effect of StWtr and Sea is stronger under the 5 km × 5 km spatial resolution. In contrast,

10

human mobility and BuiltUp are shown to be significant and robust indicators of dengue dynamics for

11

both spatial resolutions. The same conclusions hold under the sensitivity analysis performed (Table S3

12

and S4).

Results from the sensitivity analysis are presented in Supplementary Table S3 for jackknife, and Table S4

3

and Figure S6 for trip variable error. Both sets of analysis reveal minimal fluctuation in the estimated

4

model coefficients and set of significant variables, which illustrates the robustness of the model results.

5

Specifically, for both spatial resolutions, travel volumes into a given cell one week prior is always a

6

significant indicator of newly reported cases in the cell, while travel two-weeks prior is a less reliable

7

factor, and negligent at smaller spatial scales, i.e., 1 km × 1 km. Further, travel patterns one-week prior is

8

consistently identified as a more significant indicator of new dengue cases than climate and land use.

9
10

4. Discussion

11

The results from this study illustrate the critical contribution of human mobility on the location and

12

timing of new dengue cases, relative to land-use and climate variables. The results are sensitive to the

13

temporal patterns of travel during the week immediately preceding the appearance of new case reports.

14

This was the variable with the greatest predictive power. Although, travel patterns two weeks prior were

15

found to have an insignificant effect on dengue outbreak dynamics. Our results are consistent with

16

Stoddard, Forshey (11), who concluded that visits to households by dengue infected individuals

17

determines the infection risk, further validating our use of patient home locations in the model.

18

Furthermore, the significance of mobility in outbreak prediction was found to be robust under both spatial

19

resolutions of 1 km × 1 km and 5 km × 5 km.

20
21

In contrast to the role of mobility, which we found to be a consistently significant indicator of new

22

dengue cases, the effect of land-use patterns on the number of new cases is sensitive to the spatial

23

resolution of the models. Land-use variables played a larger explanatory role at the coarser spatial

24

resolution of 5 km × 5 km (compared to the finer 1 km × 1 km resolution), particularly for smaller
23

1

spatially-dominant land-use patterns such as Sea and StWtr. BuiltUp showed the strongest positive effect

2

overall, indicating urbanization is associated with an increased risk of dengue outbreak (which is

3

consistent with multiple previous findings (52, 53)). StWtr also showed significant positive effect, which

4

is to be expected because standing water provides suitable mosquito breeding habitat (19). The positive

5

effect of Sea only appeared significant when human mobility was excluded from the model. Given the

6

significant positive correlation between Sea and the number of trips (Table S2), it is likely that the large

7

travel volume towards the area near the coastline makes the study region prone to dengue outbreaks.

8

Previous studies have also found evidence that dengue mosquitoes can breed in brackish water (54),

9

further supporting our finding of the distance to the sea as significant in some of the models. If this

10

pattern holds in other regions, as seems likely, that fact can be used for the spatial prioritization of

11

resource allocation for disease case and vector surveillance and control.

12
13

Among the climate factors, temperature-related variables including Tavg, Tmin, and DTR, were more

14

strongly associated with the outbreak emergence than precipitation-related variables including Pre and

15

RD, or RH, which is related to both. This finding is in accordance with (22), which concluded that

16

“rainfall strongly modulates the timing of dengue (e.g., epidemics occurred earlier during rainy years)

17

while temperature modulates the annual number of dengue fever cases.” Based on regression analysis, we

18

found Tmin with a 10-day lead time to be the best climate-based predictor of new weekly dengue cases.

19

Given the likely robustness of this result in other regions, this fact can be used for the temporal

20

prioritization of resources.

21
22

In addition to human mobility, climate, and land-use variables, which were included as fixed effects,

23

population density was incorporated using random effects in the model because population is likely to

24

have spatially heterogeneous effects on dengue outbreaks, as noted in the Methods. Based on the model
24

1

results, the random-effects coefficients for population are mostly positive, as expected, indicating that

2

higher population density is associated with a higher number of dengue cases (Figure S5). The most

3

significant positive effect is seen north of the lagoon along the coastline, highlighting potentially high-risk

4

areas, where higher populations are likely to facilitate the emergence of dengue outbreaks. A few cells

5

resulted in negative random-effects coefficients, which may be due to confounding interactions between

6

different variables included in the model, or alternative factors not captured in the model; these cells were

7

few and only occurred in the model when the dominant mobility variable was included. It is possible the

8

dominant role of mobility could over compensate for the impact of population, e.g., because people are

9

likely to travel to crowded downtown areas, along the lagoon, or near the ocean where the large number

10

of trips made to those regions could offset the impact of population. That the random-effects coefficients

11

for population density are positive and negative lends support to the modeling decision to treat it as

12

having enough stochasticity to qualify as a random-effects variable.

13
14

The results of this analysis have implications that are relevant to the design of measures to control dengue

15

cases, such as allocation of resources for mosquito vector control. Previous global modeling of ecological

16

suitability for dengue vector mosquito species (both Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus) have shown that

17

the entire study area is a prime habitat for these species (55, 56). This conclusion drawn from the global

18

models finds validation in our analysis, which shows that climate and land-use variables are not the most

19

strongly associated with dengue case outbreaks. Consequently, epidemiological risk based on vector

20

ecology may be insufficient for the purposes of optimizing vector control resource allocation, as it is

21

unable to distinguish between potential sites to target within the study area. Because travel into the sites is

22

the most important predictor of new case clusters, it may well be time to optimize vector control resources

23

based on mobility data, with the aim to prevent exposure to the day-biting mosquitoes, i.e., Aedes aegypti,

24

at the highest risk locations. To the best of our knowledge, such a design for dengue control measures has

25

not yet been tried in the field.

2

Finally, various limitations of this study should be noted. First, only dengue patients admitted to the

3

CCMDDHF at the Negombo Hospital were included and surveyed in this study. Thus mild or

4

asymptomatic cases, which account for the majority of dengue cases (1), were not accounted for in the

5

study. Second, some patients infected in the study region may have gone to hospitals in other districts and

6

would therefore not be included. Third, the mobility data was based on patients’ recollections over a 10-

7

day period prior to hospital admission, and therefore may have inaccuracies due to human error in

8

recalling the information. However, detailed analysis of the travel data revealed most trips recorded

9

represent daily commuting routines. Thus, while some trips may be excluded due to human error, we

10

believe the relative connectivity between cells is accurately captured by the survey responses. In addition,

11

the sensitivity analysis revealed our results are robust to variation in the time of outbreak and trips

12

variable. Fourth, the distance traveled and the time spent in a certain location were not considered due to

13

the unavailability of relevant data; however these factors have been shown to have little influence on

14

dengue transmission (11), and thus their exclusion does not invalidate the methodology used in this

15

analysis. Fifth, by utilizing all the mobility data collected, we made an implicit assumption that the

16

patients were infectious during the entire 10-day period prior to hospital admittance. This period does fall

17

within the combined intrinsic incubation period (4-10 days) (57) and the early symptomatic period before

18

admitted to the hospital. A sixth assumption was that the patients were infected at or around their home

19

locations. This assumption is consistent with a wide variety of previous studies that revealed homes as the

20

primary point of contact for dengue transmission (11, 58, 59). Vazquez-Prokopec, Montgomery (12) tried

21

to identify the most plausible transmission locations based on reported contact locations from a dengue

22

outbreak in Cairns, Australia and found that only 10.2% of the identified transmission sites were at out-

23

of-home locations, and a notable portion of them were within 1 km of the home locations. Given that our

24

objective was not to model the transmission chains of dengue as in (12), assuming home locations as the

25

site of infection provides reasonable support for predicting where infected individuals reside, and
26

1

therefore the risk posed around homes of infected individuals. Lastly, the climate data were obtained from

2

a single station, thus a homogenous climatic region was assumed for our study region. Therefore, the role

3

of climate factors on the dengue outbreak may be underestimated.

4
5

While the modeling framework used here is readily applicable to other contexts, future work should

6

investigate how widely transferable the model results are. More specifically using general mobility data

7

(tracking movements for all residents); such as using mobile phone data as in (13), or transport planning

8

data, which may be more readily available and cost effective; should be compared to the use of patient

9

mobility surveys as in this study.

10
11

5. Conclusions

12

Our study highlights the potential value of using travel data to target vector control within a region. In

13

addition to illustrating the relative relationship between various potential risk factors for dengue

14

outbreaks, the results of our study can be used to inform where and when new cases of dengue are likely

15

to occur within a region, and thus help more effectively and innovatively, plan for disease surveillance

16

and vector control.
