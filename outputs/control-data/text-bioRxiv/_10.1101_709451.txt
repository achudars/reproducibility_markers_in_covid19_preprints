ABSTRACT
Motivation: Current technologies for single-cell transcriptomics allow thousands of cells to be
analyzed in a single experiment. The increased scale of these methods led to a higher risk of cell
doublets’ contamination. Available tools and algorithms for identifying doublets and estimating their
occurrence in single-cell expression data focus on cell doublets from different species, cell types or
individuals.
Results: In this study, we analyze transcriptomic data from single cells having an identical genetic
background. We claim that the ratio of monoallelic to biallelic expression provides a discriminating
power towards doublets’ identification. We present a pipeline called BIRD (BIallelic Ratio for
Doublets) that relies on heterologous genetic variations extracted from single-cell RNA-seq (scRNAseq). For each dataset, doublets were artificially created from the actual data and used to train a
predictive model. BIRD was applied on Smart-Seq data from 163 primary fibroblasts. The model
achieved 100% accuracy in annotating the randomly simulated doublets. Bonafide doublets from
female-origin fibroblasts were verified by the unexpected biallelic expression from X-chromosome.
Data from 10X Genomics microfluidics of peripheral blood cells analyzed by BIRD achieved in average
83% (± 3.7%) accuracy with an area under the curve of 0.88 (± 0.04) for a collection of ~13,300 single
cells.
Conclusions: BIRD addresses instances of doublets which were formed from cell mixtures of identical
genetic background and cell identity. Maximal performance is achieved with high coverage data.
Success in identifying doublets is data specific which varies according to the experimental
methodology, genomic diversity between haplotypes, sequence coverage, and depth.

1 INTRODUCTION
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has evolved very rapidly in recent years
(Kolodziejczyk, et al., 2015; Lan, et al., 2017; Zheng, et al., 2017; Zilionis, et al., 2017). scRNA-seq
enables higher resolution of the expression profile of cells within cells tissue and enables accurate
assessment of the single cells’ identity and variability. This new technology has been applied to a wide
range of biological studies and across many organisms, including rodents and humans. Complex tissues
were dissociated and sequenced by scRNA-seq resulting in cataloging cells by their types determining
tissue composition (Usoskin, et al., 2015; Villani, et al., 2017; Zeisel, et al., 2015) and identifying
overlooked cell types (Buettner, et al., 2015).
All scRNA-seq studies rely on profiling cell transcriptomes. The main hurdle in obtaining reliable and
high-quality data from scRNA-seq stems from the limited amounts of RNA per cell and the stochastic
nature of transcription (Ilicic, et al., 2016). Specifically, the majority of current scRNA-seq methods
suffer from low capture efficiency and high dropouts (Haque, et al., 2017). Additionally, all single-cell
expression data are signified by a strong signal of monoallelic expression which is not detected from
the sequencing pools of cells. The dominant monoallelic expression of single cells (Borel, et al., 2015;
Jiang, et al., 2017) is attributed to allelic dropout of transcripts due to the insufficient coverage, and to
the cellular phenomenon of “transcriptional burst” (Reinius and Sandberg, 2015). The latter means that
each of the alleles has its kinetics, thus at any specific time expression mostly stems from a single allele
(Larsson, et al., 2019).
Innovative technologies for scRNA-seq were developed to increase high throughput while minimizing
biological intrinsic and technical errors (discussed in (Bacher and Kendziorski, 2016; Chen, et al., 2019;
Hashimshony, et al., 2016)). Some methods make use of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
(Kolodziejczyk, et al., 2015; Wagner, et al., 2018) and microfluidic-based platforms, such as the C1
Single-Cell Auto Prep System (Fluidigm) (Xin, et al., 2016). These methods are usually followed by a
full-length transcript sequencing as in Smart-seq2 (Picelli, et al., 2014). Others use droplet microfluidic
procedures that combine a tagging step before cell lysis (reviewed in (Chen, et al., 2019; Klein, et al.,
2015). Advances in the droplet technique allow capturing beads with a single cell per droplet (dscRNAseq) thus increasing the scale for single-cell transcriptomic by two orders of magnitude (Fan, et al.,

2015; Sheng, et al., 2017). These protocols primarily use only poly-A sequencing and are thus biased
toward the 3’ side of the transcript. Most current-day protocols include additional steps of barcoding
the transcripts by UMIs (unique molecular tag identifiers) (Klein, et al., 2015), and further improvement
of the capturing efficiency (Sheng and Zong, 2019).
One of the pitfalls in the field concern a faulty identification of a doublet of cells as a single cell.
Doublets rate depends on the concentration of the input cells which is estimated from the dilution
Poisson statistics (Macaulay, et al., 2017). An increase in doublets rate is also associated with the unique
features of the subjected tissue and cells’ isolation protocols. New methods for increasing cell capturing
that reduces costs include multiplexing protocols (Zheng, et al., 2017). By increasing the number of
cells as input, the multiplexed droplet RNA-Seq (dscRNA-seq) benefits from reducing technical noise
(Zhang, et al., 2019). However, as a byproduct, it leads to an unavoidable increase in the number of cell
doublets. One of the methods to identify the rate of doublets in the data includes mixing cells from
different origin (e.g., rodents and human (Zheng, et al., 2017)). Alternatively, the dscRNA-seq setting
was carried over single cells from several individuals with a different genomic background that were
intentionally mixed for estimating the fraction of doublets in the sample (Kang, et al., 2018). Benefiting
from the SNP profile of each individual, the Demuxlet algorithm was applied to estimate mixed
individual doublets (Kang, et al., 2018). A recently published Scrublet algorithm analyzes single cells
for identifying problematic multiplets according to the nearest neighbor graph-based classifier (Wolock,
et al., 2019). DoubletFinder (McGinnis, et al., 2019) makes use of the unique cell-state expression
profiles for identifying doublets from transcriptionally distinct cells. While these set of methods can
differentiate cell mixtures from distinct individuals and cell types, they do not attempt to differentiate
cells that originate from the same source or cell type.
In this study, we analyze data from scRNA-seq and dscRNA-seq for identifying doublets without any
prior knowledge of cell-type composition. Instead, we take advantage of monitoring allele-specific
expression biases. The method called BIRD (BIallelic Ratio for Doublets) relies on analyzing
heterologous SNPs present in scRNA-seq data. We report on the accuracy of identifying doublets which
is strongly dependent on sequencing methodologies, coverage, depth and the degree of allelic diversity
in the genomic data.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 Dataset of single cells
Dataset 1. Primary human fibroblasts: A dataset of scRNA-seq of female fibroblast UCF1014 was
downloaded from the European Genome-phenome Archive (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/home) using
accession number EGAD00001001083. The data consist of two sets of scRNA-seq: 104 cells (22 PCR
cycles) and 59 cells (12 PCR cycles). The data was collected in a C1 Auto Prep System (Fluidigm)
device and sequenced using full transcript Smart-seq2 (Picelli, et al., 2014). DNA-seq of UCF1014 was
also downloaded from EGAD00001001084. The sequence data was produced and described by (Borel,
et al., 2015).
Dataset 2: Peripheral human blood mononuclear cells: The data was created and described in (Kang, et
al., 2018). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) scRNA-seq from 8 different individuals were
downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, accession number GSE96583. This
dataset contains 3 different runs. Two of the runs include a mixture of scRNA-seq from 4 different
individuals (run_a and run_b sets). The third run is a mixture of all 8 individuals scRNA-seq data
(run_c). Cells were sequenced using 10X Genomics (Chromium instrument) methodology. Additional
VCF files of exome sequencing of these individuals were extracted through Github link
(https://github.com/yelabucsf/demuxlet_paper_code/tree/master/fig2). It shares also an additional file
determining the individuals’ origin per each scRNA-seq as processed by the Demuxlet tool (Kang, et
al., 2018). Only cells that were assigned by Demuxlet to belong to the same individual and therefore
could not be explicitly annotated as singlets or doublets were used for further analysis by our
methodology.
2.2 Biallelic score for single cells
To correctly estimate the Allelic Specific Expression (ASE) and specifically, the degree of biallelic
expression of each cell, the DNA-seq of cell line UCF1014 was used to create a collection of all
heterozygous SNPs (hSNPs) using Gene Analysis Toolkit (GATK (Van der Auwera, et al., 2013)). All
the hSNPs were kept in a VCF file. The RNA-Seq reads were preprocessed using Trimmnomatic
(Bolger, et al., 2014) with its default parameters. Using STAR (Dobin and Gingeras, 2015) each

scRNA-seq FastQ file was aligned against the GRCh37 (hg19) UCSC female reference (after excluding
Y chromosome). The BAM output of the alignment and the hSNPs VCF were processed using
Allelcounter-master (Castel, et al., 2015). The tool creates a table containing the number of reads for
each SNP that matches the Reference (Ref) and the Alternative (Alt) alleles. Then we processed the
table into two tables, one for the Ref alleles and the other for the Alt alleles. Both tables contain the
number of reads assigned to each cell for each hSNP. An observation was considered for cells having
≥6 reads for a specific hSNP in a specific cell. The same procedure was applied to all single cell datasets
analyzed (described in 2.1).
For the PMBC dscRNA-seq data (Dataset 2) BAM files of the 3 runs were split to single cell BAM files
to maintain an individual-based BAM file per cell. Each single cell was identified according to its
unique cell-based barcode. Each BAM file was coupled to its corresponding individual VCF according
to the identification by the Demuxlet algorithm. (Kang, et al., 2018) and was preprocessed by
Allelcounter-master (Castel, et al., 2015). We then unified all cells that share a specific run, for a
specific individual into two tables containing the number of reads for each hSNP that matches the Ref
and the Alt alleles. As each individual contains its own set of hSNPs, tables for the Ref, Alt were created
for each of the 16 run-individual pairs. In this analysis, for an hSNP to be considered, we required the
number of reads to be ≥3 per hSNP of the subjected cell.
For both datasets we calculate for every available hSNP the Allelic Ratio (AR) of that hSNP in a specific
cell as:
𝐴𝑅#$ = '

#𝐴𝑙𝑡 𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑠
2
#𝐴𝑙𝑡 𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑠 + #𝑅𝑒𝑓 𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑠 #$

Where h refers to hSNP and c to a specific cell.
The AR ranges from 0 to 1. The value is zero when there was no observed expression from that hSNP.
Values of 0.001 and 1 correspond to reads that were fully aligned to the Ref or Alt alleles respectfully.
Genuine biallelic hSNP values are bounded by 0.1<=AR<0.9.
An allele independent score for Biallelic Ratio (denoted BAR) was calculated as follows: For a given
cell and a given gene, let 𝑖 be an index of the informative (heterozygous) variants, and define by 𝑅𝑒𝑓4
and 𝐴𝑙𝑡4 the number of reference and alternative reads each informative variant. Define by 𝑇𝑜𝑡4 =

𝑅𝑒𝑓4 + 𝐴𝑙𝑡4 the total number of reads for the variant and by 𝑀𝑖𝑛4 = 𝑚𝑖𝑛 {𝑅𝑒𝑓4 , 𝐴𝑙𝑡4 } the minimal
number of reads out of the two alleles of the variant. Let 𝑖∗ = 𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑎𝑥4 (𝑀𝑖𝑛4 ) be the most informative
variant with the maximal biallelic ratio (for the given cell and gene combination). We then define the
Biallelic Ratio (BAR) of the cell-gene as:
𝐵𝐴𝑅 =

C4DE ∗
FGHE∗

Then, for each cell we take the average BAR of all its expressed genes. Supplemental Fig. S1 shows
examples for calculating BAR which ranges between 0 and 0.5. In a formal notation

{#NOP QOKRSEXT Y#UVH QOKRSEXT }

i- Heterozygous SNP location (In the numerator stands for the specific SNP that was Max in the
denominator), c stands for cell and g for a gene.
2.3 Doublet simulation and validation
To create a reference dataset of doublets, we created doublets in silico for each of the analyzed datasets
separately (see 2.1). For the simulations we randomly sample 10% of the single cells to become cell
doublets (creating a composed collection with 5% of the original cells being simulated doublets). We
create pairs of cells, and for each pair we sum their corresponding reads from the Ref and Alt tables.
Following summation, for the fibroblast data (Dataset 1), we randomly down-sample the reads to the
average cell reads number. Due to the low coverage of the PMBCs data (Dataset 2) we skipped this
step. In each simulation, we recorded the BAR values for the singlets and the simulated doublets. The
procedure of creating simulated doublets was repeated 100 times. For each run, we record the average
of the BAR values for all the singlets or all simulated doublets.
The fibroblasts that composed Dataset 1 is of a female origin (Borel, et al., 2015). In these primary cells
the Chromosome X inactivation phenomenon was fully maintained (Wainer-Katsir and Linial, 2019).
Thus, we used the unique property of X-inactivation to obtain an expression pattern that matches the
cell specific activation of one of the X-chromosomes (Garieri, et al., 2018). Specifically, we calculate
AR per hSNP per cell. Then, we calculated AR* for assessing the biallelic ratio for chromosome X.

AR* balances between the hSNP expression from either the Ref or Alt alleles. We considered AR* to
be 1-AR in cases that AR>0.5, thus 0<=AR*<=0.5.
𝐴𝑅 ∗ = '

𝑖𝑓 𝐴𝑅 ≤ 0.5
𝐴𝑅
𝑖𝑓 𝐴𝑅 > 0.5 1 − 𝐴𝑅

To avoid a noisy signal from a sporadic expression of hSNP, we considered only SNPs that were
transcribed in >25% of the cells. We also removed hSNPs that were fully monoallelic to the Ref or the
Alt allele (i.e., AR* <0.1). Out of these hSNPs, for each cell we calculate the average of AR*. Cells
with an average AR* score of >0.05 show an unexpected biallelic X chromosome expression and were
thus considered suspicious as doublets.

2.4. Statistical measures for cell doublet identification
For both datasets Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine differences between singlets and
doublets according to the BAR values. For Dataset 1 that is based on Smart-seq2 we applied a Gaussian
Mixture Model (GMM) that differentiates the groups of singlets from doublets. The GMM was set with
two components one seeking the singlets and the other the doublets. The features that were given to the
GMM include (i) the Biallelic Ratio (BAR) of each of the cells, and (ii) the number of expressed genes
in heterozygous sites in each of the cells.
Dataset 2 (based on 10X Genomics technology) is signified by poor coverage (Supplemental Fig. S4
and Fig. S5), therefore, we included additional features per cell for recovering doublets. The four
features that were used are: (i) The number of reads over all heterozygous positions; (ii) The number of
expressed genes having heterozygous positions; (iii) The average BAR values; (iv) The fraction of
genes defined as biallelic out of all genes expressed in that cell. Each of these features was standardized
according to the specific run-individual pair (Kang, et al., 2018). Each of the standardized datasets was
trained on its own values. The datasets were split to training and test sets (with the training set covers
75% of the data). We applied Random Forest procedure with the 4 listed features for recording the
statistical results. Operating the Random Forest classifier was done with the following parameters:
n_estimators=100,

random_state=42,

min_samples_leaf=sqrt(sample

size),

min_samples_split=2*sqrt(sample size). Additionally, singlets and doublets were equal weighted by
demanding the class_weight to be balanced.
Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy in doublets identification were measured according to the success
and failure in detecting simulated and candidate doublets. ROC curve and AUC were calculated for
each run-individual pair, for each of the different runs (run_a, run_b and run_c) and for the combined
set of all three runs.

2.5. Cell separation by gene expression matrix
In this part, we followed the protocol in (Lun, et al., 2016). Count matrix of genes over cells was created
for each of the samples using HTSeq (Anders, et al., 2015). The genes to cells matrix was analyzed
using SingleCellExperiment Package (Risso, et al., 2018), scater package (McCarthy, et al., 2017) and
scran (Lun, et al., 2016). Rtsne package was used to create the t-distributed stochastic neighbor
embedding (t-SNE) (Pezzotti, et al., 2017) representation of the 26 first principal components of the
PCA of the gene expression profile of each of the run-individual pairs.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Overview of the BIRD pipeline
In single cells transcriptomics, monoallelic expression of alleles across each of the heterozygous
positions is a common phenomenon (Fig.1A). The majority of the hSNPs are monoallelic due to the
stochastic nature of expression (Borel, et al., 2015; Reinius and Sandberg, 2015). In doublets if one cell
expresses one of the alleles and the other cells the different allele, the result is a shift towards the
biallelic expression profile (i.e., 0.1<=AR<0.9). Therefore, a signal with AR centered around 0.5
represents a product of expressing hSNPs derived from both alleles. The key concept underlying BIRD
is that doublets can be identified by a signal derived from the shift toward higher biallelic expression
ratio (BAR, see Materials and methods, Supplemental Fig. S1). The transformation of each gene and
each cell from AR to its average BAR value is illustrated (Fig. 1B, left). The distribution of BAR values
from all cells is indicative for the presence of cells that display a substantial biallelic expression and
thus are most likely cell doublets (Fig. 1B, right). Testing the performance of BIRD to identify doublets,

is based on artificially creating doublets by combining expression profiles from random single cells and
testing the potency of statistical methods to correctly identify such in silico simulated doublets (Fig. 1C
and Fig. 1D).
3.2 BAR values for the fibroblast scRNA-seq data
The human primary fibroblast cells (total of 163 single cells) are comprised of two datasets according
to the PCR protocol used for creating the sequencing library. The first collection consists of 104 cells
that underwent 22 PCR cycles, and the second set consists of 59 cells that underwent 12 PCR cycles.
Due to the different PCR protocols, the sequencing depth is different between the two cell collections
(Supplementary Fig. S2) and they are thus treated for the BIRD protocol as independent sets. Fig. 2
shows the results of doublet simulations for each of these datasets. The distributions of the means of
singlets vs doublets for 100 simulation runs (each with 5% of artificially created doublets) are shown
in Fig. 2A and Fig. 2C. Both datasets resulted in a perfect separation with (Mann-Whitney U test
statistic=0, and p-value <e-34). The cell values for a single simulation run are also very significant (Fig.
1B and Fig. 1D). The results from the 104 cells (22 PCR cycles) and the 59 cells (12 PCR cycles) show
Mann-Whitney U test with a p-value of 4.25e-30 and 1.43e-17, respectively. The results of identifying
doublets are data-specific but highly significant for the two cell collections despite the different
sequencing depth associated with each.
3.3. Doublets verification based on Chromosome X inactivation expression pattern
The primary fibroblast cells are of a female origin. Thus, in each cell, only one of the two X
chromosomes is active (i.e. Xa) while the other is inactivated. The expression patterns for the subset of
hSNPs on Chromosome X having substantial evidence are shown (Fig 3A). Most cells (columns) are
signified by a single expression pattern that is indicated by Haplotype 1 and Haplotype 2. Only a few
cells lean toward biallelic expression pattern over many X chromosome genes. Based on hierarchical
clustering of the cells, the cells that are suspicions as doublets are clustered in the leftmost subtree and
on the leftmost leaf of the other two subtrees. The distribution of the AR* values for all 163 cells is
shown in Fig 3B. AR*=0 means monoallelic X chromosome expression, and the higher the AR*, the
higher the biallelic expression is. Applying a natural threshold that separates cells with monoallelic and
biallelic patterns (the striped line at AR*=0.05) allows focusing on cells that cross the threshold (8

cells). These cells are marked as cell doublet candidates. Notably, these suspicious 8 cells are also
signified by a higher BAR values for the 104 (Mann-Whitney U test p-value=2.94e-4) and 59 (MannWhitney U test p-value=0.023) cells as shown in Supplemental Fig. S3.
3.4. Unsupervised identification of doublets for the fibroblast scRNA-seq data
Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) was used to separate singles from doublets. For the means of the 100
simulations, the separation between the singles and the doublets means reached 100% accuracy. For an
illustrative of a single simulation run the mean BAR (x axis) of each cell is plotted with the number of
genes that are expressed in biallelic positions (y-axis, Fig. 3C, and Fig. 3D). The scatter-plots symbols
represent cells that are singlets, candidate cell doublets according to Chromosome X biallelic
expression, and artificial doublets that are created by in silico simulations for the two fibroblast cell
collections (104 and 59 cells based on PCR protocol for 22 and 12 cycles, respectively). Cells that were
predicted as doublets by the GMM (whether true or false) are shown (dark orange). It is evident that
most doublets and the Chromosome X candidate doublets have relatively high BAR values and are
classified as doublets. For the 104 single cells dataset, all simulated doublets (total 5) were identified
(100%), and 3/6 (50%) of the candidates by X biallelic expression were identified. For the 59 cells, all
3 simulated doublets were identified (100%) and 50% of the cell candidate doublets (one out of two)
according to the Chromosome X biallelic expression were correctly identified.
3.5 BAR values for the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) dscRNA-seq data
The 13,364 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) originate from 16 datasets that account for a
pair of a run and an individual. When compared to the fibroblast cell collections (Dataset 1, see
Materials and methods), the dscRNA-seq is characterized by a much lower coverage (Supplemental
Fig. S4 and S5). Specifically, the number of informative genes is >2000 for the fibroblasts and only
about 25 on average for the PBMCs (Supplemental Fig. S2, Fig. S4, and Fig. S5).
We simulated as in the fibroblasts, for each of the datasets, 10% of the singles to be paired into in silico
doublets (overall 5% of each dataset would be doublets). BIRD was run on each of the 16 run-individual
pairs and their in silico simulated doublets. The results from activating the BIRD process for an
individual representative (run_b, individual 1493, denoted b_1493, 766 cells) are shown in Fig. 4. (and
Supplemental Fig S4).

Fig 4A shows the violin plots of the mean of the BAR values for 100 simulations for singlets when
compared to cell doublets. For the means of the singles and the doublets, the separation is maximal
with Mann-Whitney U test yields a statistic=0, and a p-value <e-34. For a single run of the simulation
(Fig 4B), the trend of the doublets being more biallelic is kept with a separation of the Mann-Whitney
U test yielding a p-value of 1.22e-03. Note that using BAR values alone is insufficient to distinguish
between singles and doublets due to the high intrinsic noise in the data originated by the 10x Genomics
protocol.
3.6 supervised identification of doublets in the PMBC dataset
Including additional features and applying a supervised Random Forest machine learning protocol (see
Materials and methods), we reached a perfect separation with 100% accuracy when mean values of
singlets and mean values of simulated doublets are compared for 100 simulation runs. For a single
simulation run, we show the results of the Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve for the
unseen, disjoint test. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the ROC curve equals 0.9 (Fig 4C). As each
run starts with a randomized set of simulated doublets, we report the average AUC for 10 independent
such runs (mean 0.88, s.d. 0.04). We exploit the expression profile for the cell collection of b_1493
sample to create a t-SNE representation (Fig 4D). The cells are color coded according to the prediction
results. Note that most identified doublets are positioned at the border of the expression clusters, but
eventually other predicted doublets are fully embedded within an expression cluster. Recall that the
expression profile information was not used by BIRD protocol for the separation of the prediction.
Similar to the analysis performed for a single dataset (b_1493) we repeated the analysis for all 16
combinations of runs and individuals. The AUC values for the different datasets of the run-individual
pairs (see Supplementary Table S1) are shown in Fig 5A. We tested whether the performance (as
indicated by the AUC) is a mere reflection of the number of cells. However, it is evident that the success
in identifying doublets and the number of cells that are associated with each dataset are not correlated
(Supplemental Fig. S6A). The sensitivity (i.e. TP/(TP+FN)) for each of the 16 datasets is shown in Fig
5B and Supplementary Table S1. Note that the values in Supplementary Table S1 for dataset b_1493
are slightly different from results in Fig. 4 due to the component of randomness in the algorithm. The
doublets rate in the sample (including the simulated cells) is shown in Supplemental Fig. S6B. We

created a unified ROC curve per each of the three runs and determined the AUC associated with each
run and the whole dataset (Fig 5C).
The t-SNE cell expression representations are colored according to the BIRD prediction and the
Random Forest protocol, for each of the 16 datasets are shown in Supplemental Fig S7 for run_a and
run_b (4 t-SNE representations per each run) and Supplemental Fig S8 for run_c (all individuals, 8 tSNE representations). In all instances, the t-SNE representation shows that accurate predictions (TP)
tend to cluster together with cells that are marked as false positives (FP). The estimate for the fraction
of doublets from the mixture of two individuals is ~5% (Kang, et al., 2018). Therefore, we expect many
of the cells that are marked as FP to be doublets that are naturally present in the original data.

4 DISCUSSION
Collecting data of single-cell transcriptomes had exposed a new dimension of cell variability. This
technology had a direct impact on a wide range of biological questions across all domains of life (Stegle,
et al., 2015). Some of these questions are sensitive to the faulty annotation of singlets as doublets or
vice versa. While the presence of unrecognized cell doublets from the same cell type will not influence
the misinterpretation for new cell types (Usoskin, et al., 2015; Villani, et al., 2017; Zeisel, et al., 2015),
it might jeopardize interpretation concerning transcription regulation including transcriptional bursting
kinetics (Larsson, et al., 2019), Chromosome X-inactivation phenomenon (Garieri, et al., 2018;
Tukiainen, et al., 2017), escaping from it (Wainer-Katsir and Linial, 2019) and more.
We describe BIRD as a computational/statistical method that enables the identification of cell doublets
from scRNA-seq data. The method complements other methods that rely on detailed cell mixing and
cell-type expression profiles. BIRD method takes advantage of the BAM files generated for each
scRNA-seq. The allelic specific expression that is extracted from the BAM files is often unused. This
is since, routinely, the post-sequencing analysis starts with a cell to gene matrix representation thus
discards the allelic information. BIRD takes advantage of this transparent feature for identifying
doublets.
Recent biochemical-based methodologies for dscRNA-seq present their potency toward the task of
doublet identification. These methods are based on adding a pre-sequencing biochemical modification

step for barcoding cells. Such tagging procedures exploit antibodies to common cell surface antigens
(cell hashing) (Stoeckius, et al., 2018). The antibody-based method applies to cells that carry the
relevant antigens. A new method (MULTI-seq) (McGinnis, et al., 2019) successfully uses lipid
modification step for cell indexing. It was shown to be eligible for solid tissues and frozen cells
(McGinnis, et al., 2019). While there are many advantages for tagging cells before cell lysis and
sequencing, an additional step in the experimental design can lead to batch effect and other technical
and experimental biases. In contrast, the computational method is generic, yet data sensitive. BIRD
shows no preference to the identity of the expressed genes, to the specific cell type or any of the cell
extraction protocol.
We illustrate the high performance of BIRD mostly on in silico simulated doublets. Other studies
estimated the rates of doublets by artificial mixing of cells of multiple types of cells from different
organisms, cell types or individuals (Kang, et al., 2018; McGinnis, et al., 2019; Zheng, et al., 2017).
However, when a solid tissue is treated to produce a collection of single cells, the protocol must
overcome the adhesion forces between cells, extracellular matrix cohesion and more. Additionally,
some cells tend to aggregate and clump following their isolation. All these technical issues may lead to
an increasing number of doublets from neighboring cells with identical genetic background and
expression profile. Therefore, current estimates for doublet contamination based on peripheral blood
samples may be misleading. We anticipate that the number of reported doublets of cell mixtures from
solid tissue is underestimated and can now be estimated using BIRD.
There are several limitations of BIRD protocol that need to be addressed: (i) The method is dependent
on pre-knowledge of the individual genomics for assigning hSNPs from the sequenced scRNA-seq.
With the fast accumulation of whole-genome and exome sequencing in humans and other model
animals, we anticipate it will not be a limiting factor in the near future. (ii) The assessment of doublets
using the notion of Chromosome X inactivation is only valid for cells of female origin. Furthermore,
for 50% of the cases, cells can be mixed without providing a biallelic signature (i.e. a mixture of the
same Xa haplotype). (iii) While BIRD protocol ignores the gene expression profile, a scenario in which
the expression profiles of cell mixtures do not overlap with each other can occur. This will result in cell
doublets that do not contribute different alleles of the same genes and thus will not increase the BAR

values. In such cases, BIRD protocol lacks the power to identify doublets. In this case, the use of other
doublet cell identification is advisable (e.g. (McGinnis, et al., 2019; Wolock, et al., 2019)). (iv) The
method relies on the dominant properties of stochasticity in the allelic expression of cells. Datasets that
are far less stochastic might display a higher biallelic signal. Under such conditions, the ability to detect
doublets is masked. The monoallelic fraction in single cells is a variable property of the experiment
(Kim, et al., 2015) with mouse cells showing a lower degree of allelic specific expression relative to
humans (Deng, et al., 2014; Tang, et al., 2011). Indeed, testing the scRNA-seq from F1 mice strains
(Larsson, et al., 2019), confirms that the BAR value distribution is consistent with an intrinsic biallelic
signature (not shown). In such cases, there is a need to employ BIRD only on genes that exhibit a more
stochastic property and are signified by a monoallelic expression.
Overall, we described two types of datasets that use the BAR feature for discriminating singlets from
doublets. The overall coverage of hSNPs and sequence depth are drastically different (Supplementary
Fig. S2 Fig. S4 and Fig. S5) among the two analyzed datasets. The unsupervised GMM tool was
sufficient in separating singles from doublets in a dataset of high hSNP coverage (based on Smart-seq2
technology, with a full transcript sequencing). The other dataset (dataset 2, 10X Genomics) yields
shallow coverage which is restricted to the 3’ tail of the transcripts and was therefore trained using
Random Forest. Despite the described coverage and difference in the sequencing protocols (3’ based
versus a full-length transcript), the mean values of the simulated doublets were 100% identifiable for
both datasets indicating a higher BAR values for doublets compared to singlets. Even in the cases of a
single run, a trend of higher BAR values for doublets was observed and therefore used to successfully
separate the simulated doublets from the singlets in both datasets.
In summary, BIRD protocol is a generic method that is indifferent to the composition of the cells in the
samples of to the nature of the genes that are expressed. It is on the other hand strongly dependent on
the stochasticity of the system for identifying doublets according to the deviation from the default signal
of monoallelic expression that dominate single cells. We applied BIRD on datasets of different
coverage, scale, and accuracy. BIRD uses a data-driven protocol and is applicable in all instances where
in addition to the scRNA-seq / dscRNA-seq data genomic heterologous sites are available.

SUPPLEMENTAL FIGURES & LEGENDS

Fig. S1.
The numeric transition from reads per hSNP to BAR of cells. (A) In each cell for each gene for each
expressed SNP, the BAR is determined. First, the number of Alternative (Alt), Reference (Ref) and
total reads are counted for each position. The algorithm takes the BAR of an hSNP to be the ratio
between the reads of the minimal expressing allele divided by the total reads of that position. Then for
each gene, the hSNP with the maximal value of BAR is chosen as a representative hSNP BAR (as
indicated by the bottom row). Additionally, each hSNP is recorded as biallelic or not. And one
representation of a biallelic hSNP determines the gene as biallelic (rightmost column). (B) For each
gene, in each cell, the BAR is recorded. For a specific cell, it’s BAR distribution will be according to
the BAR of its genes. The average of the genes BAR will define the cells BAR.

Representation of t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) classification on PCA reduced
data of cell expression for each of the run-individual paired samples in run_a and run_b (4 individuals
per each run). Each dot represents a single cell or a simulated doublet. Singlets (gray) corresponds to
cells that are singles and were predicted by the model as singles. True positives (TP, red) correspond to
cells that are simulated as doublets and correctly predicted as such. False Negatives (FN, blue) are
simulated doublets that were missed by the model. False Positives (FP, purple) are misclassified by the
model as doublets. For the individual-run pairs of (A) a_1079, (B) a_1154, (C) a_1249, (D) a_1598,
(E) b_1043, (F) b_1085, (G) b_1493, and (H) b_1511.
