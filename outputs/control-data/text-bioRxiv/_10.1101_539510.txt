TRANSCRANIAL DIRECT CURRENT STIMULATION AND PROPRIOCEPTION
24

ABSTRACT

25

Introduction: Proprioception (perception of one’s limb position) is critical for accurate and

26

consistent movement, and is processed by the sensorimotor cortex. Increased prefrontal activity

27

is associated with improved proprioception and motor performance. Anodal transcranial direct

28

current stimulation (tDCS) of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been found to

29

increase activity of the sensorimotor cortex. Thus, this study aimed to investigate whether anodal

30

tDCS of the DLPFC may enhance proprioception measured with a target task. It was

31

hypothesized that tDCS over the left DLPFC would improve motor performance (error and

32

variability) on a target task completed without vision.

33

Design: Single blind, within-participant, sham-controlled trial.

34

Methods: Fifteen healthy young adults (M:F=6:9, age=23.3 years) completed 18 trials of a

35

computerized target task (manipulating a mouse) with their non-dominant upper-limb, with and

36

without vision, before and after (pre/post assessment) 20-minutes of stimulation (anodal tDCS of

37

the left DLPFC) and sham conditions. Averages and coefficient of variation (CV, variability

38

between trials) of spatio-temporal parameters associated with the movement were measured.

39

Stimulation/ sham sessions were counterbalanced (stimulation first session, n=8), with each

40

session separated by one week. Repeated-measures ANOVA and pairwise comparisons (95%

41

confidence intervals [CI]) were conducted.

42

Results: Regarding distance travelled CV, a significant interaction between condition and

43

assessment (F(1,14)=5.09, p=0.041) demonstrated that variability was significantly less post-

44

stimulation compared to pre (p=0.003). A significant interaction between assessment and vision

45

(F(1,14)=30.08, p<0.001) regarding distance travelled CV showed that without vision, variability

46

was significantly less at post compared to pre (p<0.001), and this decrease was found after the

47

stimulation condition only (95% CI = ∆ 7.4 +/- 1.6 [4.0 to 10.9]).

48

Conclusion: Since variability of distance travelled during the target task without vision was

49

lower post-stimulation compared to pre, consistency of movement without vision, and therefore

50

proprioception, may have been enhanced by anodal tDCS of the DLPFC. This improvement

51

could be due to modulation of fronto-striatal-thalamic circuits. These findings may be the first

52

step in developing tDCS methods as an effective adjunct therapy for dysfunctional

53

proprioception in various disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease.

1. INTRODUCTION
Proprioception refers to the perception of one’s limb position in physical space (1–3). To

71

perform novel tasks, humans utilize multiple sensory modalities to ensure accuracy of

72

movement, such as visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive information, the most relied upon being

73

vision (4). Reliance on each sensory modality is not static but rather dynamic, and the degree to

74

which we utilize each sensory modality depends on the task performed (5–7). For example, when

75

vision is removed (such as when one’s eyes are closed), reliance on proprioceptive feedback to

76

guide movement becomes predominant (5). With effective use of proprioception, individuals can

77

make precise movements with little variability, despite lack of vision (1). However, in cases of

78

impaired processing of proprioception (such as in Parkinson’s disease), movement accuracy

79

decreases and variability increases (3,8–12), which could potentially lead to tripping, falling, and

80

hospitalization (13–17). Interestingly, individuals with Parkinson’s disease are thought to

81

compensate for postural deficits by increasing activation of prefrontal cortex activity (18). Thus,

82

an understanding of the neurophysiological processes involved in proprioception and the

83

importance of fronto-striato-thalamic pathways are vital to establish future therapies for

84

individuals with impaired perception of limb position in physical space.

85

Proprioceptive input from peripheral receptors is transmitted via the dorsal column and

86

spinocerebellar pathways to the thalamus and then onto the somatosensory cortex (19). Based on

87

studies in Parkinson’s disease, proprioception relies heavily on sensorimotor loops through the

88

basal ganglia (8,9,20,21). Deficits in cerebro-basal ganglia circuitry may be compensated for via

89

increased activity in frontal striatal pathways (18,19,22). An increase in alpha power observed

90

via EEG in the prefrontal cortex has been associated with proprioceptive training (23) whilst

91

increased activation in the sensorimotor cortex reflects improved performance at proprioceptive

tasks. For instance, Iandolo and colleagues (2015) demonstrated that while healthy participants

93

completed a proprioceptive matching task in which neural correlates were investigated via

94

functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the sensorimotor cortex activation increased

95

(24). Taken together, this previous work suggests that an increase in sensorimotor cortex

96

activation could be enhanced, and that fronto-striato-thalamic pathways may be a means of

97

mediating this enhancement. One way to potentially influence sensorimotor cortex functioning in

98

a safe and non-invasive manner is with the use of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).

99

Transcranial direct current stimulation refers to the application of electrical current

100

through electrodes placed on specific regions of the scalp (25,26). The current passes through the

101

scalp and has been postulated to modulate membrane potential, thus leading to increased or

102

decreased neuronal excitability (27,28). Stimulation via tDCS may be applied with either a

103

positive current (anodal tDCS) that facilitates neuronal excitability or a negative current

104

(cathodal tDCS) (25) that inhibits neuronal excitability. Therefore, one might predict that anodal

105

current could be utilized to modulate sensorimotor excitability, and thus influence proprioceptive

106

processing. Various brain regions could be targeted with anodal stimulation, although as

107

previously discussed, fronto-striato-thalamic pathways may be a means of mediating

108

proprioceptive enhancement. One prominent area of interest in sensory modulation has recently

109

been the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The DLPFC is a critical region for

110

cognitive and emotional processing, properties previously exploited with anodal tDCS to

111

modulate working memory (29,30), sustained attention (31), depression (32,33), and various

112

other processes in both healthy and patient populations (34). Importantly, manipulation of

113

neuronal excitability in the DLPFC has been found to modulate sensory perception, such as pain,

114

fibromyalgia (35,36), and more recently, tinnitus (37). It should be noted that these diverse

115

effects are not the result of separate networks, but rather interconnected circuitries, demonstrated

116

recently by Deldar et al. (2018) whom concluded that anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC

117

improved pain via enhanced working memory (38). The non-specific cognitive, emotional, and

118

sensory modulatory effects of tDCS over the DLPFC can be attributed to both the poor

119

localisation of tDCS and the modulation of interconnected networks, as opposed to only local

120

cortical areas underlying the electrodes (34).

121

In a novel study, Stagg and colleagues (2013) demonstrated that twenty minutes of

122

anodal stimulation over the left DLPFC resulted specifically in increased perfusion of the

123

sensorimotor cortices bilaterally, indicating greater functional connectivity between the left

124

DLPFC and the sensorimotor cortex (measured with magnetic resonance imaging) (39). Since

125

increased activity of the sensorimotor cortex may indicate improvement to proprioceptive

126

processing (40), anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC might be expected to result in improved

127

proprioception in a group of healthy individuals. In addition to increased coupling between the

128

DLPFC and the sensorimotor cortex, Stagg and colleagues (2013) found decreased functional

129

connectivity between the left DLPFC and the thalamus after anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC.

130

This decrease in coupling between the DLPFC and the thalamus has been suggested to be a key

131

contributor underlying modulation of sensory thresholds (i.e. decreased perception of pain) after

132

tDCS over the left DLPFC (35,39,41), and might be expected to hinder proprioception. However,

133

increased activity in the thalamus in individuals with Parkinson’s disease with chronic deep brain

134

stimulation has been shown to lead to proprioceptive deficits suggesting that this stimulation

135

could result in thalamic, thalamocortical or corticothalamic connectivity alterations that impair

136

proprioception (42). The disruption of sensory processing in individuals with Parkinson’s disease

137

has been suggested to be due to a deficit in sensory gating which may explain why both increases

138

and decreases in sensory thresholds appear to be observed in this cohort. Since anodal tDCS over

139

the DLPFC is commonly used to modulate sensory thresholds, the question as to whether tDCS

140

may enhance proprioception is a timely and important inquiry to gain further insight into

141

mechanisms underlying sensory modulation.

142

Various methods have previously been utilized to assess proprioception and thus make

143

inferences regarding proprioceptive processing (1). One common method is a joint position

144

reproduction task (43–45). For this task, a participant’s limb begins in a neutral position that is

145

subsequently moved, either passively or actively, to a target joint position. The participant’s limb

146

is then returned to the neutral position in which the participant’s goal is to return his/her limb to

147

the remembered target position, all of which is accomplished without the use of vision. Effective

148

proprioception would result in minimal error between the target position and the performed

149

position with minimal variability between trials (1). Similarly, targets may be utilized in which a

150

participant is required to move his/her limb or an object to a target with and without the use of

151

visual feedback, referred to as a visuomotor target task (10). Again, minimal error between the

152

target position and performed position with minimal variability between trials is indicative of

153

effective proprioception.

154

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of anodal

155

transcranial direct current stimulation applied over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex on

156

proprioception in healthy adults, assessed with the use of a visuomotor target task. It was

157

expected that if tDCS over the left DLPFC does increase activity of the sensorimotor cortex that

158

is involved in the perception of proprioceptive information, than performance (error and

159

variability) on a target task completed without vision might improve (i.e. decreased error and

160

variability compared to baseline). In contrast, if tDCS over the left DLPFC decreases activity of

the thalamus involved in projecting sensory information to various regions of the cortex and

suppressing erroneous information, than performance on a target task completed without vision

might be hindered (i.e. increased error and variability compared to baseline).

167
168

2.1. Participants
Fifteen healthy young adults (M:F=6:9; Right handed:Left handed= 12:3; age=23.3

169

years) participated in the present single blind, within participant, sham-controlled study.

170

Members of the Trinity College Dublin community were recruited by word-of-mouth.

171

Participants were included if they were between the ages of 18 and 30 years, and had not been

172

diagnosed with any medical condition. Participants were excluded if they had a history of

173

epilepsy, fainting, syncope, head trauma, severe headaches, movement disorders, or neuropathy.

174

The Faculty Research Ethics Committee of Trinity College Dublin approved this study. All

175

participants were informed of the experimental protocol. Written consent was obtained according

176

to the Declaration of Helsinki prior to testing.

177
178
179

2.2. Experimental Setup
Participants were asked to visit the lab on two separate occasions, one week apart, to

180

complete a visuomotor target task (task description to follow) before and after (pre- / post-

181

assessment) a stimulation or sham condition (stimulation and sham protocol description to

182

follow). At the beginning of the first session, each participant completed a medical health

183

questionnaire form to determine eligibility and to sign the informed consent. Furthermore,

184

participants completed the Waterloo Handedness Questionnaire (47) to determine degree of

185

upper-limb dominance. Participants additionally completed the Trail-Making Task (parts A and

186

B) (48) and the digit span working memory task. Whether completion of the stimulation or sham

187

condition took place on the first or second visit to the lab was randomized and counterbalanced

188

(8 participants completed the stimulation condition on the first session). Each participant

189

completed both stimulation and sham conditions. Participants began each session by completing

190

baseline evaluation of proprioception with the visuomotor target task. Subsequently, participants

191

received twenty minutes of either anodal tDCS stimulation over the left DLPFC, or twenty

192

minutes of sham. After completion of either stimulation or sham, participants completed the

193

visuomotor target task again.

194
195
196

2.3. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a safe, non-invasive neuromodulatory

197

technique that delivers a low current to the scalp. Since the purpose of the study was to apply

198

current over the left DLPFC in a similar fashion to that completed by Stagg and colleagues

199

(2013), the tDCS method utilized in the current study followed a similar protocol. A NeuroConn

200

DC stimulator (neuroConn GmbH, Germany) was utilized to apply current. The anodal electrode

201

was positioned on the F3 position (using the 10/20 EEG system for positioning transcranial

202

magnetic stimulation) while the cathodal electrode was placed on the contralateral supraorbital

203

ridge (36,39,49). Each 5 x 7cm electrode transferred current to the scalp via a saline-soaked

204

surface sponge (49). In the stimulation condition, participants received 20 minutes of 1mA

205

current with fade-in/fade-out periods of 10 seconds while seated (39). In the sham condition,

206

participants were subjected to an identical protocol as the stimulation condition. However,

207

participants received only 30 seconds of 1mA current with fade-in/fade-out periods of 10

208

seconds, followed by 19minutes, 30seconds of no stimulation. Participants were blinded to

209

whether they received stimulation or the sham condition. To provide an indication of current

210

distribution through the brain using the electrode montage described above (i.e. anodal over F3

211

and cathodal over supraorbital ridge), HD-Explore Neurotargeting software (HD-Explore

212

Version 2.1, Soterix Medical) was utilized.

213
214

2.4. Visuomotor Target Task to Assess Proprioception

215

To measure proprioception with a visuomotor target task, Matlab R2017b (The

216

MathWorks, Natick, MA) and Psychtoolbox-3 programs were utilized. Matlab / Psychtoolbox

217

code were used to generate three separate coloured squares situated in different locations of a

218

monitor that served as the targets (in the upper right corner [blue], upper left corner [red], and

219

upper middle [green]; Fig 1). Participants sat at a desk in a comfortable position in front of the

220

computer monitor, which presented the three squares. Participants were asked to move a

221

computer mouse that manipulated the cursor on the monitor using their non-dominant upper-limb

222

throughout the task. Use of the non-dominant upper-limb was chosen to increase task difficulty

223

so as to avoid ceiling effects. The goal of the task, with each trial, was to move the cursor on the

224

monitor (with the mouse) from the starting point, situated at the bottom middle position, to the

225

centre of one square. Before each trial, the investigator instructed the participant as to which

226

square was the target of that trial, and whether they were able to use visual information. In trials

227

where vision was permitted, participants completed the task by moving the mouse from the

228

starting position to the middle of the designated square for that trial. Once the participant

229

believed they were in the correct position, the trial was completed. In trials where vision was not

permitted, participants were given 2 seconds to see the position of the square, then were asked to

231

move a blindfold over their eyes with their dominant upper-limb, and subsequently move the

232

mouse/cursor with their non-dominant upper-limb to the position they believed was the middle

233

of the designated square. Once the cursor was in the position they believed was the middle of the

234

square, the trial ended. Prior to starting the task, the participant completed five practice trials for

235

each box to become familiarized with the task. Participants completed 3 trials for each square

236

(left, middle, right), both with and without vision (vision vs. no vision), before and after (pre vs.

237

post assessment) stimulation and sham conditions, for a total of 72 trials. Participants were not

2.5. Data and Statistical Analysis
The Matlab output provided x-y pixel coordinates (converted to millimeters [x/3.795]) of

266

the mouse cursor collected at 60Hz. From this output, the following upper-limb movement

267

parameters were calculated: i) spatial error of the trial endpoint compared to the middle of the

268

designated square (millimeters [mm]); ii) movement time (seconds) comprising the total time

269

elapsed from movement initiation to movement cessation; iii) distance travelled (mm) from

270

movement initiation to movement cessation; iv) velocity (mm/second); v) x-y r-squared (spatial

271

variability throughout the movement path where greater values indicate lower variability); vi) x-

272

time R squared and y-time r-squared (spatial/temporal variability throughout the movement

273

path). Within each parameter, data from each trial regarding each square target (left, middle and

274

right) was collapsed to establish an average and coefficient of variation (CV = (standard

275

deviation/mean) x 100) between trials.

276

To investigate the influence of anodal tDCS over the DLPFC on the average and

277

variability (CV) of upper-limb movement (with respect to the target) spatial error, time, distance,

278

velocity, and r-squared (x-y; x-time; and y-time), three-factor (condition [stimulation vs. sham] x

279

assessment [pre vs. post] x vision [vision vs. no vision]) mixed repeated measures analysis of

280

variance (ANOVA) were utilized. To determine where significant differences were with respect

281

to main effects and interactions, a Fisher’s Least Significant Difference (LSD) post hoc analysis

282

was used. Additionally, pairwise comparisons within (differences between pre and post

283

assessment; differences between vision and no vision) and between the stimulation and sham

284

means were conducted (95% Confidence Intervals [CI]) with regard to each upper limb

285

movement parameter. All results were analyzed using StatSoft STATISTICA 8.0.550 (StatSoft

286

Inc, Tulsa, Oklahoma) and the level of significant difference was set to p=0.05.

With respect to modeled current distribution through the brain with HD-Explore

Neurotargeting software, estimated current flow and magnitude for the anodal-F3 and cathodal-

employed by the montage of the present study, potential brain regions affected by stimulation

may be highlighted. Figure 2 demonstrates that anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC and cathodal

341

With respect to all movement parameters measured during the visuomotor target task,

342

multiple significant main effects and interactions were uncovered. Firstly, to demonstrate that

343

blindfolding participants did remove visual input and influenced an increased reliance on

344

proprioception to guide movement, main effects of vision were found with respect to average

345

spatial error (F(1,14)=799.4, p<0.001), velocity CV (F(1,14)=36.24, p<0.001), average x-y r-

346

squared (F(1,14)=27.21, p<0.001), x-y r-squared CV (F(1,14)=12.09, p=0.004), average x-time

347

r-squared (F(1,14)=23.29, p<0.001), x-time r-squared CV (F(1,14)=13.39, p=0.003), average y-

348

time r-squared (F(1,14)=5.66, p=0.032), and y-time r-squared CV (F(1,14)=6.48, p=0.023).

349

Specifically, throughout the visuomotor target task, participants demonstrated significantly

350

greater average spatial error, x-y r-squared, x-time r-squared, and y-time r-squared when the task

351

was performed without vision compared to with vision. Additionally, when performing the

352

visuomotor target task with vision, variability between trials was significantly greater with

353

respect to velocity, x-y r-squared, x-time r-squared, and y-time r-squared compared to no vision.

354

Main effects of assessment (pre vs. post) were found with respect to movement time

355

(F(1,14)=5.31, p=0.037) and velocity (F(1,14)=5.54, p=0.034), such that at post assessment,

356

participants performed the visuomotor target task with a significantly shorter movement time and

357

greater velocity. It should be noted that pairwise comparisons (95% CI) between pre and post

358

assessment demonstrated that with vision in the sham condition, movement time decreased from

359

pre assessment to post (95% CI = 0.3 +/- 1.4 [0.1 to 0.6]), although not in the stimulation

360

condition. Additionally, with and without vision in the sham condition, velocity increased from

361

pre assessment to post (95% CI vision = -10.9 +/- 4.8 [-21.1 to -0.7]; no vision = -12.1 +/- 4.8 [-

362

22.3 to -1.8]).

A significant interaction between condition, assessment, and vision was found with

364

respect to variability (CV) of spatial error between trials (F(1,14)=8.75, p=0.011; Fig 3), and

365

Fisher’s post hoc uncovered a number of significant differences. Firstly, within the stimulation

366

condition, at post assessment only, spatial error variability between trials was significantly

367

greater when participants had the use of vision compared to when blindfolded (no vision)

368

(p=0.027). Secondly, within the sham condition, at pre assessment, spatial error variability

369

between trials was significantly greater when participants had the use of vision compared to

370

when blindfolded (p=0.002). Moreover, spatial error variability with vision within the sham

371

condition significantly decreased from pre assessment to post (p=0.02). Finally, spatial error

372

variability with vision was significantly greater at pre assessment of the sham condition

373

compared to pre assessment of the stimulation condition (p=0.013).

Interestingly, regarding the variability of distance travelled (CV), significant interactions

381

between condition and assessment (F(1,14)=5.09, p=0.041), and between assessment and vision

382

(F(1,14)=30.08, p<0.001) were found (Fig 4). Fisher’s post hoc revealed three significant

383

findings. Firstly, distance travelled variability between trials was significantly lower after

384

stimulation (post) compared to before stimulation (pre) (p=0.003). Secondly, regardless of the

385

condition or assessment, participants demonstrated significantly greater distance travelled

386

variability without vision compared to with vision (p<0.001). Thirdly, when participants

387

performed the task without vision, variability of distance travelled was significantly lower at post

388

assessment compared to pre (p<0.001). Notably, pairwise comparisons demonstrated that the

389

variability of distance travelled without vision decreased from pre assessment to post in the

390

stimulation condition (95% CI = 7.4 +/- 1.6 [4.0 to 10.9]), and not the sham (95% CI = 1.2 +/-

391

1.6 [-2.2 to 4.7]). Variability of velocity between trials without vision also decreased from pre

392

assessment to post within the stimulation condition (95% CI = 7.1 +/- 3.3 [0.1 to 14.1]), and not

393

the sham (95% CI = 3.6 +/- 3.3 [-3.4 to 10.6]).

Finally, a significant interaction was found between condition and assessment in regards

423

to x-y r-squared variability between trials (F(1,14)=8.57, p=0.011; Fig 5). Fishers post hoc

424

uncovered that x-y r-squared CV was significantly greater at post assessment compared to pre

425

within the stimulation condition (p=0.004). Furthermore, x-y r-squared variability was

426

significantly greater at post assessment of the stimulation condition compared to post assessment

427

of the sham condition (p=0.017). Interestingly, pairwise comparisons demonstrated that the

428

increase in x-y r-squared variability, from pre assessment to post, in the stimulation condition

429

was only found when participants completed the task with vision (95% CI = -12.8 +/- 5.9 [-25.5

to -0.2]), and not without vision (95% CI = -6.3 +/- 5.9 [-19.0 to 6.3]).

4. DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this was the first study to investigate the influence of anodal

442

transcranial direct current stimulation applied over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex on

443

proprioception in healthy adults. It was hypothesized that if anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC

444

does increase activity of the sensorimotor cortex that is involved in the perception of

445

proprioceptive information, movement error and variability on a visuomotor target task

446

performed without vision might improve. Interestingly, participants completed the visuomotor

447

target task with significantly lower distance travelled variability after anodal tDCS compared to

448

before (Fig 4a). When participants performed the task without vision, variability of distance

449

travelled was significantly lower at post compared to pre (Fig 4b), and this decreased variability

450

was found specifically after stimulation, but not sham. Therefore, after 20 minutes of anodal

451

tDCS of the left DLPFC, variability of distance travelled during the visuomotor target task

452

without vision had decreased, indicating that consistency of movement without vision improved.

453

Typically, as proprioception is enhanced or becomes more relied upon, conscious adjustments of

454

movement decrease and consistency of movement performance increases (50–54). Since this

455

decrease in variability was not found after the sham condition, it is unlikely that the improved

456

consistency was the result of performing the task a second time. In summary, consistency of

457

upper-limb movement improved after anodal tDCS of the left DLPFC and this may be an

458

indication of enhanced proprioception. The significant findings with regards to the other

459

movement parameters provide further support to these inferences.

460

Before anodal tDCS of the DLPFC, spatial error variability during the visuomotor target

461

task was similar between vision and no vision parameters. After anodal tDCS, spatial error

462

variability was significantly lower when participants performed the target task without vision

463

compared to with vision (Fig 3). Furthermore, from pre stimulation to post, without vision,

464

spatial error variability anecdotally decreased, although this was only indicated by a trend

465

(p=0.075). The decrease in spatial error variability may support the previous findings (distance

466

travelled variability decrease after tDCS without vision) that indicate improved consistency

467

between trials, and therefore enhanced proprioception after anodal tDCS of the left DLPFC that

468

was not found after the sham condition. However, interpretations of these findings cannot be

469

strongly made since spatial error variability with vision before the sham condition, was

470

significantly greater than spatial error variability with vision before the stimulation condition. An

471

explanation for this finding cannot be made since data collection was performed in an identical

472

fashion prior to both stimulation and sham conditions and the experimental design was

473

counterbalanced. However, since this aberrant finding was only found with the use of vision and

474

not when participants performed the target task while blindfolded, spatial error variability, and

475

therefore proprioception, may have improved after anodal tDCS of the left DLPFC and not after

476

the sham.

477

The final finding of interest was a significant interaction between condition and

478

assessment with respect to x-y r-squared variability between trials. The x-y r-squared is a

479

quantitative measure of the spatial variability throughout the movement path where greater

480

values indicate lower variability, and therefore fewer adjustments throughout the route from the

481

starting point to the target. The coefficient of variation of the x-y r-squared is therefore a

482

measure of variability between trials with respect to the amount participants made adjustments

483

throughout each trial. Figure 5 demonstrates that from pre stimulation to post, x-y r-squared

484

variability significantly increased, indicating that the amount of adjustments made throughout

485

each trial was more variable after anodal tDCS compared to before. This finding might suggest

TRANSCRANIAL DIRECT CURRENT STIMULATION AND PROPRIOCEPTION
486

that after stimulation, participants attended more to their movements throughout each trial, which

487

resulted in a greater degree of variability between trials and may indicate a decrement in

488

proprioception, contradicting our previous findings. However, pairwise comparisons

489

demonstrated that the increase in x-y r-squared variability, from pre stimulation to post, was only

490

found when participants completed the task with vision. This might suggest that the significant

491

increase in variability from pre stimulation to post was driven by task performance with vision

492

and not without. Nevertheless, these findings with respect to distance travelled variability, spatial

493

error variability and x-y r-squared variability allow for various inferences.

494

Stagg and colleagues (2013) demonstrated that anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC resulted

495

in increased activity of the sensorimotor cortex and decreased activity of the thalamus. One may

496

have hypothesized that increased activity of the sensorimotor cortex might enhance

497

proprioception, and decreased functional connectivity between the DLPFC and the thalamus

498

(35,39,41) might hinder proprioception. Our results demonstrated that anodal tDCS of the left

499

DLPFC resulted in decreased variability with respect to the end-point of each trial (i.e. decreased

500

distance travelled CV and spatial error CV without vision after stimulation compared to before).

501

Therefore, the modulation of proprioceptive processing in this study may have been enhanced by

502

increased sensorimotor cortical activity induced by anodal tDCS over the DLPFC. Previous work

503

has demonstrated that anodal tDCS, which facilitates neuronal excitability, significantly

504

decreases concentrations of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-amino butyric acid in local

505

cortical areas underlying the anodal electrode (55). Down-regulated inhibition of the DLPFC

506

may underlie various changes in networks associated with the DLPFC that yielded improved

507

proprioception, such as enhanced sensorimotor activity (39,55).

TRANSCRANIAL DIRECT CURRENT STIMULATION AND PROPRIOCEPTION
508

On the other hand, greater variability between trials with respect to the movement

509

performed in reaching the end-point (i.e. increased x-y r-squared variability from pre assessment

510

to post) might suggest that proprioceptive processing was hindered, supporting the notion that

511

stimulation of the left DLPFC decreased activity of the thalamus projecting sensory information

512

to various regions of the cortex, allowing irrelevant information to propagate through the

513

thalamus that might interfere with proprioceptive processing (46). Although, another explanation

514

for the increased variability with respect to x-y r-squared may be that stimulation of the left

515

DLPFC influenced participants’ focus of attention. Previous work has demonstrated that the left

516

DLPFC is recruited when individuals pay attention to performance of pre learned tasks (50).

517

Moreover, anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC has been found to modulate various cognitive

518

processes, such as working memory (29,30) and sustained attention (31). Therefore, by

519

stimulating the DLPFC, focus of attention towards enhanced online proprioceptive feedback

520

during movement may have been increased, resulting in variability between trials. Alternatively,

521

if proprioception became enhanced, participants may have gained improved ability to process

522

that proprioceptive feedback online during movements, allowing them to make more fine tune

523

adjustments (increased x-y r-squared variability) to achieve lower spatial and distance travelled

524

variability.

525

To date, no study has directly aimed to enhance proprioception with the use of tDCS.

526

However, multiple studies have investigated the influence of tDCS on postural control, a

527

dynamic process in which integration of proprioception with visual and vestibular information is

528

imperative for effective balance. Craig and Doumas (2017) recently demonstrated that anodal

529

tDCS applied over the primary motor cortex or the cerebellum in young and older healthy adults

530

did not improve postural control (56). Similarly, anodal tDCS over the primary motor cortex was

TRANSCRANIAL DIRECT CURRENT STIMULATION AND PROPRIOCEPTION
531

not found to facilitate learning of a dynamic balance task, a phenomenon one might expect if

532

tDCS enhanced sensorimotor cortical activity (57). In a very relevant contrast to these two null

533

findings, Zhou and colleagues (2015) demonstrated that tDCS applied over the left DLPFC

534

improved postural control while participants performed a balance task in single and dual-task

535

(serial subtraction) conditions (58). These findings by Zhou et al. (2015) are critical in

536

establishing the importance of anodal tDCS over the DLPFC, and not other sites such as the

537

cerebellum or primary motor cortex, in order to improve proprioception.

538

Performance of a motor and cognitive task simultaneously is an effective method to

539

determine the degree to which the motor task requires attention for successful performance (59).

540

Since Zhou et al. (2015) found that postural control (motor task) while counting backwards by

541

three’s (cognitive task) improved after anodal tDCS of the left DLPFC, this might indicate that

542

postural control required less cognitive demand after stimulation (60,61). Meanwhile, Stagg and

543

colleagues (2013) demonstrated that anodal tDCS of the left DLPFC increased activity of the

544

sensorimotor cortex (39). Thus, the improved postural control while dual-tasking found by Zhou

545

et al. (2015) may have been the result of increased sensorimotor activity that improved

546

proprioceptive processing, decreasing the requirement for attention to control balance.

547

Importantly, these findings by Zhou and colleagues (2015) amalgamated with the findings by

548

Stagg et al. (2013) further support that the improved consistency of upper-limb movement after

549

anodal tDCS of the left DLPFC found in the present study may be indicative of enhanced

550

proprioception.

TRANSCRANIAL DIRECT CURRENT STIMULATION AND PROPRIOCEPTION
553

The findings from the present study may be the first step in developing tDCS methods as

554

an effective adjunct therapy for dysfunctional proprioception in various disorders, such as

555

Parkinson’s disease (3,8–12), wherein progressive neurodegeneration of dopamine producing

556

cells of the basal ganglia takes place. Impaired processing of proprioception results in increased

557

variability of walking (62–65), which leads to falling (15,66), injury (16,67), and even

558

hospitalization (17). Dopaminergic replacement medications have been found to effectively

559

manage motor symptoms in individuals with Parkinson’s disease, but are ineffective for the

560

alleviation of increased walking variability (68,69). Non-invasive neurostimulation of the

561

prefrontal cortex has previously been demonstrated to modulate dopamine release in sub-cortical

areas (70,71). Previous research has indicated that prefrontal neurostimulation leads to

563

improvements in working memory (72) and depression (73) in individuals with Parkinson’s

564

disease, but some indication of a trend with regards to motor symptoms (74). These studies

565

focused on clinical assessments of motor function and simple reaction time tasks rather than an

566

assessment of changes in proprioception. Therefore, tDCS over the left DLPFC could in future

567

studies be assessed as an effective adjunct therapy used to ameliorate proprioception deficits in

568

individuals with Parkinson’s disease.
