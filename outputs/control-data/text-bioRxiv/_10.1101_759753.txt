Abstract
Background: Although depression is recognized as the leading cause of disability worldwide,
decades of research have identified few actionable preventive factors. Using phenotypic and
genomic data from the UK Biobank, we took advantage of a unique opportunity to screen a wide
range of potentially modifiable factors that could offset known risk factors for depression.
Methods: We curated baseline data on more than 100 lifestyle and environmental factors in
participants’ lives, including behavioral (e.g., exercise, sleep, media use, diet), social (e.g.,
support, activities), and environmental (e.g., greenspace, pollution) variables. In a follow-up
survey, participants reported on their traumatic life experiences and mental health, including
depression. Polygenic risk scores for depression were generated based on large-scale genomewide association results. Excluding those meeting criteria for depression at baseline, we
identified at-risk individuals at high predicted probability (> 90th percentile) for clinically
significant depression at follow-up based on their (i) polygenic risk, or (ii) reported traumatic life
events. Using a factors-wide design corrected for multiple testing and adjusted for potential
confounders, we identified modifiable factors associated with follow-up depression in the full
sample and among at-risk individuals. Using a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR)
design, we then examined which significant factors showed potential causal influences on
depression risk, or vice versa. Results: A range of baseline modifiable factors were
prospectively associated with follow-up depression, including factors related to social
engagement, physical activity, media use, and diet. MR follow-up analyses provided further
support for the effects of social support-seeking, TV use, and other factors on depression risk.
Conclusion: As the field increasingly quantifies the role of genetic factors in complex conditions
such as depression, knowledge of modifiable factors that could offset one’s genetic risk has

become highly relevant. Here, we present an approach to screening for potentially modifiable
factors that may offset the risk of depression in general and among at-risk individuals. In light of
the burden of disease associated with depression and the urgent need for actionable preventive
strategies, this approach could help prioritize candidates for follow-up studies including clinical
trials for depression prevention.

Introduction
Depression now represents the leading cause of disability worldwide1, highlighting a
pressing need for effective treatment and prevention strategies. However, despite decades of
research into the causes and consequences of depression, our knowledge of actionable strategies,
including modifiable factors that could mitigate depression risk at the population level, remains
relatively limited. Two of the best substantiated risk factors for depression—genetic vulnerability
and early life adversity2,3—are effectively unmodifiable in adults.
A number of critical research gaps are evident. First, the literature to date has primarily
focused on validating a limited set of candidate modifiable factors such as physical activity4,5 or
social support6. While theoretically grounded and informative, there may be additional factors
that could modify depression risk but remain overlooked or unknown. Scanning a wider range of
factors could help confirm existing relationships while potentially identifying novel targets for
prevention strategies. Systematically testing the relationship between many variables and a single
outcome for hypothesis-free discovery is now common practice in other fields in the form of
genome- or phenome-wide association studies and has led to new insights about underlying
associations7,8, but has not been applied to searching for modifiable factors for depression.
Second, few studies to our knowledge have assessed the relative influence of multiple modifiable
factors in the same population. Although individual studies may pursue intriguing variables (e.g.,
dietary factors), the influence of these factors on depression—while statistically significant in a
narrower context—may not be robust or as clinically important when considered with other
factors. Understanding the relative importance of modifiable factors for depression has been
limited to date by inadequate sample sizes for multiple testing and the lack of comprehensive

measurements of modifiable factors in a single study, but is now enabled by large cohort studies
such as the UK Biobank9 in which wide-ranging assessments are available.
Third, we do not always know which modifiable factors can make a difference for
individuals who are at particularly elevated risk for genetic and/or environmental reasons. Some
factors that generally help prevent depression in the general population may not necessarily be
most relevant for individuals with specific risk profiles10, and vice versa. Genetic vulnerability
represents an important source of risk for depression, with heritability estimates over 40%2.
Similar to many other psychiatric disorders, depression is now recognized as a polygenic
condition11—influenced by many variants across the genome with individually small effects12.
As we are increasingly able to quantify polygenic risk for depression13 and potentially return this
information to individuals in the future14, it becomes vital to expand knowledge of effective
actionable measures for those identified at elevated risk. In addition to genetics, life history
factors such as traumatic events are known to increase risk for depression15. As we more
comprehensively assess established sources of genetic and environmental risk in a precision
medicine framework16, knowledge of modifiable factors that are most relevant for high-risk
individuals could help guide recommendations on how to offset pre-existing vulnerabilities for
depression17.
Finally, modifiable factors may be associated with depression in observational data for
myriad reasons, including unaccounted third variables (i.e., confounding) as well as reverse
causation (e.g., whereby depression risk influences observed behavioral patterns). To strengthen
conclusions about which factors may be high-priority intervention targets, Mendelian
randomization (MR) analyses can be used to further test the relationship between empirically
identified modifiable factors and depression. MR is an alternative strategy for potential causal

inference that uses genetic variants inherited at birth to approximate a natural experiment in
which individuals are assigned to varying average lifetime levels of an exposure (e.g., social
affiliation) in relation to an outcome of interest (e.g., depression)18. While MR also has its
limitations, its use of genetic data bypasses typical sources of confounding in observational data
and allows for independent triangulation of traditional questions19. We previously leveraged the
MR framework to validate a relationship between objectively measured physical activity and
reduced risk of depression5. Here, we extend this framework to examine a range of potential
factors that may influence depression.
In the present study, we took advantage of a unique opportunity to screen a broad range
of potentially modifiable factors for depression. Using phenotypic and genomic data from UK
Biobank participants without substantial depressive symptoms at baseline, we conducted
association tests between 105 potentially modifiable factors and clinically significant depression
at follow-up (Figure 1). Given the established causal role of genetics and traumatic life events
on depression risk, we also aimed to identify modifiable factors that may influence depression
even in the context of these largely static risk factors. Finally, we used two-sample Mendelian
randomization analyses to further assess the directional and potentially causal relationships
between identified modifiable factors and depression.

distinctions with previous depression analyses in the UK Biobank are summarized in

Our sample consisted of 123,794 adult individuals of white British ancestry who enrolled
in the UK Biobank, had high-quality genomic data (for quality control procedures, see Methods
S1), and completed an online follow-up mental health survey approximately five years after their
initial enrollment (Figure 1). Data analytic procedures were approved by the institutional review
board at Partners HealthCare and conducted as part of UK Biobank application #32568. Data
processing and statistical analyses were conducted between October 2018 and July 2019.
Measures
Depression. At baseline, participants reporting depressed mood and/or anhedonia (for
details, see Methods S2) for more than half the days in the past two weeks were considered to
have elevated depressive symptoms20 and were excluded (n=5,416; leaving n=118,378). Followup symptoms of depression were then measured in an online survey approximately five years
after the baseline assessment, using the PHQ-921, which were summed to create an overall score
ranging from 0 to 27. To derive predicted probabilities for depression to stratify at-risk groups,
we created a binary variable for clinically significant depression at follow-up based on a score
cut-off of >1022.
Modifiable factors. We curated data on 105 potentially modifiable factors that were
measured or derived at the baseline assessment (Table S1). These factors included behavioral
(e.g., exercise, sleep, media use, diet), social (e.g., activities, support), and environmental (e.g.,
greenspace, pollution) variables. We selected these variables by inspecting the UK Biobank
online data showcase (http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/index.cgi) for broad domains of
modifiable factors and relevant variables within these domains. After review by three separate
authors (KWC, JWS, KN), we included variables in a domain that were (a) not likely a close
comorbidity of mental health (e.g., substance use or cognitive functioning); (b) putatively

modifiable at an individual and/or societal level (e.g., lifestyle or environmental factors); and (c)
largely available for most participants and not just administered to a small subset (e.g., based on
branching response options). Potentially correlated variables within a category (e.g., 16-hour and
24-hour noise pollution) were retained to assess the relative influences of all available variables.
We also selected two non-modifiable variables hypothesized to be unrelated to depression, i.e.,
hair color and skin tanning tendency, as negative controls. Data cleaning and processing were
performed on all variables (described in Methods S3 and Table S1). Continuous variables were
scaled to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.
Traumatic life experiences. Participants also reported on their history of traumatic life
experiences in the online follow-up survey—including childhood physical, sexual, and emotional
abuse; partner-based physical, sexual, and emotional abuse; and other lifetime traumatic events,
specifically, sexual assault, violent crime, life-threatening accident, and witnessing violent death
(for details, see Methods S2).
Covariates. Baseline variables were also extracted for basic participant characteristics
(i.e., participant sex, age, assessment center); sociodemographic factors (i.e., socioeconomic
deprivation, employment status, household income, completion of higher education, urbanicity,
household size); and physical health factors (i.e., BMI, and physical illness/disability) (for details
and inclusion rationale, see Methods S2).
Polygenic risk scoring
Polygenic risk scores (PRS) were generated based on large-scale genome-wide
association results for major depression11—specifically, we used summary statistics (discovery
GWAS n=431,394) from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium leaving out the UK Biobank to
minimize sample overlap and including 23andMe data for improved statistical power. We

retained SNPs with minor allele frequency > 0.01 and INFO quality score > 0.80 for scoring. To
generate polygenic risk scores, we applied PRS-CS23—a Bayesian polygenic prediction method
that places a continuous shrinkage (CS) prior on effect sizes for all HapMap3 SNPs and infers
posterior SNP weights using GWAS summary statistics combined with an external LD reference
panel (1000 Genomes Project European sample). Because PRS-CS (available as a Python
package via https://github.com/getian107/PRScs) allows multivariate modeling of local LD
patterns and can accommodate a range of underlying genetic architectures while preserving all
SNPs for scoring, it demonstrates increased explanatory power compared to conventional and
other Bayesian methods, particularly when using a large discovery GWAS23 (for comparison
with conventional clumping and thresholding, see Methods S4). We set the global shrinkage
parameter at 0.01 to reflect the likely polygenic architecture of major depression. Scores were
calculated by summing the number of risk alleles at each SNP multiplied by the posterior SNP
weight inferred using PRS-CS, with a total of 1,090,207 included SNPs. We standardized the
scores within this analytic sample (mean=0, SD=1; for distribution, see Methods S4). We then
extracted residuals from a model in which PRS were regressed against the top 10 European
ancestry PCs provided by the UKB for use as stratification-adjusted PRS in subsequent analyses.
Stratifying participants at risk for follow-up depression
Among individuals with available data on later depression and risk variables (i.e.,
polygenic risk and reported traumatic life events) (n=113,587; 5% meeting criteria for follow-up
depression), we removed a holdout training sample of 1,000 participants consisting of an even
split of randomly selected cases and controls for follow-up depression (for rationale, see
Methods S5). In this holdout training sample, we regressed follow-up depression against (a)
polygenic risk, or (b) reported traumatic life events. For the latter, each traumatic life event was

entered as a separate independent variable within a multivariable model to estimate relative
weights of each event on depression risk, rather than assuming equal influences. We obtained
regression model coefficients for each set of risk variables from the training sample (Methods
S5) and used these coefficients as weights to generate predicted probability scores for follow-up
depression for individuals in the remaining testing sample (n=112,587)—based on (a) polygenic
risk, or (b) reported traumatic life events (for resulting distributions, see Methods S5). Selecting
individuals with high predicted probability scores (> 90th percentile) for depression, we obtained
three samples: (i) individuals in the full sample unselected for risk (full; maximum n=112,587),
(ii) individuals at higher risk based on genetic factors (PRS; maximum n=11,258), and (iii)
individuals at higher risk based on reported traumatic life events (TLE; maximum n=11,258).
Only 13.8% of participants (n=1,558) could be assigned to both PRS and TLE risk groups,
suggesting only modest overlap and potentially distinct influences on depression (for exploratory
results in this reduced sample, see Figures S20-25).
Factors-wide association scan
Using a factors-wide association approach with logistic regression (Methods S5), we
tested associations between each baseline modifiable factor and clinically significant follow-up
depression in each of these samples (Figure 1), with a conservative Bonferroni-corrected
threshold for establishing top hits (p = 0.000159, i.e., 0.05 divided by 105 tests in three primary
analytic samples). All associations were adjusted for participant sex, baseline age, and
assessment center (Model 0). We further adjusted for potential sociodemographic confounders
described earlier (Model 1), then added physical health factors (Model 2). All analytic samples
were restricted to participants with full covariate data (full: maximum n=100,519; PRS:
maximum n=10,093; TLE: maximum n=10,152) to ensure differences in results between

successively adjusted models reflected the addition of covariates, rather than varying sample
size. We also descriptively assessed the degree of overlap between significant factors in each atrisk sample versus the full sample.
Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses
We performed bidirectional two-sample MR analyses (Methods S6) between depression
and modifiable factors identified in the fully adjusted factors-wide association scan (Model 2) for
the full sample and at-risk groups, if any. For genetic instruments, we accessed the GWAS Atlas
online database24 (https://atlas.ctglab.nl) to obtain publicly available UK Biobank-based
summary statistics for each identified factor. For depression, we retained the summary statistics
from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium11 used for polygenic scoring. As genetic instruments,
we extracted highly associated SNPs (p < 1x10E-7) that were clumped for independence at r2 >
0.001. Using the TwoSampleMR package in R25, we conducted MR analyses to estimate the
effect of each modifiable factor on the risk of depression, and vice versa. For primary MR
analyses, we combined per-SNP effects using inverse variance weighted (IVW) meta-analysis,
where the resulting estimate represents the slope of a weighted regression of SNP-outcome
effects on SNP-exposure effects where the intercept is constrained to zero. We applied MRPRESSO26 in combination with additional tests (i.e., Cook’s distance, studentized residuals, Qvalue outliers) to detect statistical outliers reflecting likely pleiotropic bias27, and removed these
outliers to generate estimates for reporting. We relaxed the instrument p-value threshold for
several traits (p < 1x10E-6; i.e., vitamin B; walking frequency) that did not have sufficient SNPs
(three or fewer) following outlier removal. We then compared the pattern of IVW results to other
established MR methods whose estimates rely on different assumptions and are known to be
relatively robust to horizontal pleiotropy, specifically the weighted median approach28 and MR

Egger regression29. We further assessed horizontal pleiotropy using standard methods including
leave-one-SNP-out analyses, the modified Cochran’s Q statistic, and the MR Egger intercept
test30. Finally, for significant results, we searched each instrument SNP in the PhenoScanner v2
database (http://www.phenoscanner.medschl.cam.ac.uk), to identify known associations with
depression-related traits at p<1x10E-5 with each instrument SNP or any SNPs that were in
linkage disequilibrium at r2>0.80, and assessed whether removing these SNPs substantively
changed the pattern of results. Reported estimates were converted to odds ratios where the
outcome was binary, and interpreted using a conservative Bonferroni-corrected p-value threshold
(0.05/number of factors with available summary statistics).
Results
Sample description
In the full sample, participants were 54% female and had a mean baseline age of 56.1
(standard deviation, SD = 7.7). 46% reported college or university qualifications, 65% reported
current paid or self-employment, and 64% reported average household income of 31,000 pounds
or higher. Participants had a mean BMI of 26.7 (SD = 4.4) and 26% endorsed physical
illness/disability. Overall, 3.9% met the cut-off for clinically significant symptoms at follow-up;
as expected, the prevalence of follow-up depression was elevated within the high PRS group
(6.1%) and the high TLE group (12.1%).
Modifiable factors prospectively associated with depression status in the full sample
In the full sample, 49 factors were significantly associated with depression (Model 0)
(Figure S1 and Table S2a), ranging across physical activity, media use, sleep, social,
environmental, and dietary domains. After adjusting for sociodemographic factors (Model 1), 39
factors were significantly associated with depression (Figure S2 and Table S2b). After further

Of the 29 top hits identified in Model 2, 18 factors were associated with reduced odds of
depression and 11 were associated with increased odds of depression (Figure 3; Table S2c). The
top ten factors included six protective factors: confiding in others (aOR=0.83, 95% CI [0.820.85], p=9.50E-100); sleep duration (aOR=0.83 [0.80-0.85], p=5.31E-33); engaging in exercises
like swimming or cycling (aOR=0.70 [0.66-0.75], p=2.88E-25); walking pace (aOR=0.79 [0.740.84], p=3.33E-15); being part of gym/club (aOR= 0.77 [0.72-0.83]; p=3.93E-12); and cereal

Factors associated with depression among at-risk individuals based on polygenic risk
Among individuals at high predicted probability for depression based on polygenic
scores, 12 factors were identified to be significantly associated with depression (Model 0)
(Figure S6 and Table S2d), ranging across physical activity, media, sleep, social, and dietary
domains. After adjustment for sociodemographic factors (Model 1), 10 factors showed
associations with depression (Figure S7 and Table S2e). After further accounting for physical
health factors (Model 2), five factors remained associated with depression (Figure S9 and Table
S2f). Notably, each of these factors had been identified in the full sample (Figure 2). Of these
(Figure S8), two were associated with reduced odds of depression: frequency of confiding in
others (aOR=0.85 [0.81-0.89], p=2.87E-13) and sleep duration (aOR=0.81 [0.75-0.88], p=4.07E07). The other two factors were associated with increased odds of depression: time spent using
the computer (aOR=1.17 [1.09-1.26], p=1.19E-05), salt intake (aOR=1.21 [1.10-1.30], p=1.31E04), and time spent using the TV (aOR=1.17 [1.08-1.27], p=1.57E-45).
Factors associated with depression among at-risk individuals based on traumatic life events
Among individuals with high predicted risk for depression based on their reported
traumatic life events, 18 factors were significantly associated with depression (Model 0) (Figure
S13 and Table S2g). After adjustment for sociodemographic factors (Model 1), 16 factors were
significantly associated with depression (Figure S14 and Table S2h). After further adjusting for
health factors (Model 2), five factors remained associated with depression (Figure S16 and
Table S2i). Again, each of these factors had been identified in the full sample (Figure 2). Of
these (Figure S15), four factors were associated with reduced odds of depression: frequency of
confiding in others (aOR=0.85 [0.82-0.88], p=5.87E-23); engaging in exercises like swimming

or cycling (aOR=0.66 [0.58-0.74], p=6.30E-11); sleep duration (aOR=0.84 [0.79-0.89], p=7.93E09); and typical walking pace (aOR=0.81 [0.73-0.90], p=1.56E-4), while one factor was
associated with increased odds of depression: time spent watching TV (aOR=1.15 [1.08-1.22],
p=9.15E-06).
Follow-up Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses
All modifiable factors identified within at-risk groups had been identified in the full
sample; thus, we tested any factors identified in the adjusted full sample (Model 2) with available
GWAS summary statistics. Bidirectional MR analyses between each factor and depression
revealed a number of findings suggesting causal influences (Figure 4 and Figure 5); results
across MR methods for each factor are summarized in Table S3.
MR evidence supported a beneficial effect of confiding in others (OR=0.76 [0.67-0.86],
p=2.53E-05; 10 SNPs), with non-significant effects in the reverse direction. No effect
heterogeneity (Q statistic=5.5, p=0.78) was observed, and the MR-PRESSO global test (p=0.82)
and MR Egger intercept test (p=0.78) did not provide evidence of horizontal pleiotropy. Given
the lower number of SNPs tested, this effect remained notably significant when relaxing the
instrument SNP p-value threshold to 1x10E-6 (OR=0.89 [0.84-0.95], p=7.63E-4; 50 SNPs), and
when retaining only SNPs with no known associations with potentially relevant traits in the
PhenoScanner database (Table S3). We also found MR evidence supporting a deleterious effect
of TV use (OR=1.09 [1.04-1.15], p=1.33E-03; 145 SNPs), with non-significant effects in the
reverse direction. No effect heterogeneity (Q statistic=130.8, p=0.78) was observed, and the MRPRESSO global test (p=0.44) and MR Egger intercept test (p=0.78) did not provide evidence of
horizontal pleiotropy.

Daytime napping showed bidirectional effects with depression, such that daytime
napping was linked to higher odds of depression (OR=1.34 [1.17-1.53], p=1.82E-05; 91 SNPs)
while depression was also associated with increased daytime napping (beta=0.05 [0.03-0.06],
p=8.45E-11; 43 SNPs), with no evidence of effect heterogeneity or horizontal pleiotropy in
either direction. Surprisingly, MR evidence suggested that multivitamin use was also linked to
increased odds of depression (OR=1.28 [1.11-1.47], p=6.04E-04; 6 SNPs); however, with the
lower number of SNPs tested, this effect was notably attenuated when relaxing the instrument
SNP p-value threshold to 1x10E-6 (OR=1.07 [1.0-1.14], p=0.0498; 30 SNPs). Depression was
also nominally associated with increased intake of multivitamins (OR=1.06 [1.002-1.13],
p=4.07E-2; 44 SNPs). Other nominal results at the traditional p<0.05 threshold are summarized
in Methods S7 and included tea intake (protective), frequency of family/friend visits
(protective), exercises such as cycling or swimming (protective), and salt intake (riskincreasing).

Discussion
Although depression is recognized as the leading cause of disability worldwide, decades
of research have identified few actionable prevention strategies. We recently used MR to validate
the protective effect of objectively measured physical activity5 on depression risk, but have
expanded this program of research to assess contributions to depression risk from a wider range
of modifiable factors. Using phenotypic and genomic data from UK Biobank participants, we
screened a broad panel of potentially modifiable factors that may offset genetic and
environmental vulnerability to incident depression. Consistent with literature regarding the

multifactorial nature of depression risk31, we identified numerous modifiable factors that were
prospectively associated with depression ranging across multiple domains, including physical
activity, social, media-related, and dietary domains.
Several factors identified to be protectively associated with depression were not
unexpected—but received novel validation in an MR framework. The frequency of confiding in
others, an index of emotional social support, showed a robust phenotypic association consistent
with MR results even after removing potentially pleiotropic instruments, suggesting that
increased confiding in others is likely to be causally linked with reduced odds of depression. This
echoes previous evidence on the mood-related benefits of social support6 and substantiates its
role in preventing depression. Frequency of visiting family/friends also showed nominal results
in the MR framework, suggesting that multiple dimensions of social support (not only reaching
out to confide in others, but generally having increased social interactions) may help reduce risk
of depression. Consistent with these findings, we previously demonstrated that greater levels of
social cohesion in a sample of military personnel reduced the risk of incident depression despite
high polygenic risk or exposure to traumatic events32.
As expected, engagement in various kinds of physical activity showed protective
associations with follow-up depression. However, these relationships were not strongly
supported in the MR framework. We previously observed5 using MR that while objective
measures of physical activity (not included here) are linked to reduced odds of depression, selfreport measures of physical activity do not necessarily show these patterns. Objective measures
of physical activity—reflecting a broad tendency for movement/activity—have demonstrated
higher heritability33 and may yield more powerful genetic instruments in an MR framework.

Indeed, the self-report activity variables examined in the present study tended to have fewer
genome-wide significant SNPs than other traits examined (e.g., media use).
Our MR findings were also consistent with prior evidence that increased TV time is a risk
factor for poor mental health, including depression34. This work adds to broader evidence linking
screen time to mental health outcomes35 and suggests that reducing hours spent watching TV
could have a role in mitigating depression risk. It remains unclear whether these effects are due
to screen time and media exposure per se, or whether TV watching serves as a proxy for time
spent in sedentary behavior more generally, which has been associated with depression36.
Nominal MR results also suggested some possibility for reverse causation, where increased use
of other screen-based media (e.g., computer use) appeared to be a consequence of depression.
Other modifiable factors that have received less attention also emerged in our scan.
Daytime napping was not only phenotypically associated with increased depression risk but also
showed bidirectional influences in the MR context. These results suggest that increased daytime
napping could increase risk of depression, and therefore limiting (excessive) daytime napping
could prove beneficial for reducing depression risk—however, that depression may also increase
one’s tendency to engage in daytime napping. Conversely, greater overall sleep time was
associated with reduced odds of follow-up depression; however, this relationship was not
substantiated in the MR framework. This may be because sleep shows a more complex and nonlinear relationship with depression37 than could be modeled in this broad focus study.
Among the more surprising findings was an association between multivitamin use and
increased odds of follow-up depression that was supported by initial MR analysis, though
attenuated when considering a more relaxed set of genetic instruments. We also found evidence
of reverse causation (whereby individuals with depression may turn to vitamin supplementation),

which may have contributed to this phenotypic association. To our knowledge, no studies have
linked multivitamin use to increased risk of depression so caution is required, particularly since a
meta-analysis of multivitamin supplementation trials found no significant effect on depressive
symptoms38. Prior studies of vitamin intake and depression have largely focused on individual
micronutrients (such as vitamin D and folate), with highly mixed results39.
Environmental factors such as pollution and exposure to natural environment showed
initial associations with depression—risk and protective effects, respectively—that did not
persist after adjusting for sociodemographic factors, and were thus not tested in the MR
framework. While these unadjusted findings were in line with growing evidence40, it may be that
environmental exposures exert stronger influences earlier in development41, or shape lifetime
mental health risk rather than incident cases in a relatively short follow-up period. In addition,
sub-features of the natural environment (e.g., tree versus grass coverage) have shown divergent
effects on mental health risk42, requiring more nuanced study than possible here.
The recent emergence of precision medicine as a framework for disease prevention and
treatment motivated our effort to examine whether protective factors operate differentially
among individuals at higher risk for depression. We found that all factors identified as protective
among at-risk individuals (whether based on polygenic risk or reported traumatic life events)
were also protective in the full sample. This suggests that the benefits of these identified factors
can be observed in the presence of static vulnerability factors such as genetic risk or reported
traumatic life events.
Our study should be evaluated in light of several limitations. First, while we considered a
wide array of lifestyle and environmental factors, we were limited by the variables available in
the UK Biobank database, which did not include coping styles or psychological factors that

could also be modifiable with respect to depression risk. Second, our study relied on self-report
measures which can be subject to reporting biases and may not optimally capture all underlying
factors of interest. Our assessment of follow-up depression was based on a self-report measure
that, while widely used, may not be fully concordant with a clinical diagnostic interview. In
addition, the self-reported outcome could explain stronger associations with factors that were
also self-reported and have an emotional component (e.g., social factors). Third, confirmation of
causal effects may require randomized controlled trials of preventive interventions. In some
cases, such trials might be prohibitively costly, require long duration of follow-up, or be
otherwise unfeasible. We sought to address this with a prospective design complemented by
Mendelian randomization analyses, which provides an important alternative for verifying
actionable strategies. However, it should be noted that MR estimates reflect lifelong average
effects of genetic variants and should not be interpreted in the same way as effects from a
discrete intervention trial or within a brief follow-up period. The absence of an MR result does
not disconfirm the potential importance of a factor operating within more acute time frames.
Finally, our analyses were restricted to an older white British sample that volunteered for
research and thus represents a healthier and more engaged population43, and may thus not be
generalizable to other populations.
In conclusion, there has to date been limited systematic, large-scale research on
modifiable factors for depression. Here, we demonstrate a novel two-stage approach to
identifying factors that may protect against the development of depression. Using a large-scale
sample with both genomic and wide-ranging lifestyle and environmental measures, we screened
more than 100 potentially modifiable factors for their association with incident depression,
including among at-risk individuals, and then tested potential causal effects in a Mendelian

randomization framework. Our results prioritize an array of potential targets for prevention
strategies, including behavioral and lifestyle factors, aimed at reducing the risk of depression. In
light of the enormous burden of depression and the dearth of validated avenues for prevention,
our results may have important implications for the future of precision psychiatry.
