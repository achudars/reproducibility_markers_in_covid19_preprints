Abstract
Biorefining of renewable feedstocks is one of the most promising routes to

27

replace fossil-based products. Since many common fermentation hosts, such as

28

Saccharomyces cerevisiae, are naturally unable to convert many component plant cell

29

wall polysaccharides, the identification of organisms with broad catabolism capabilities

30

represents an opportunity to expand the range of substrates used in fermentation

31

biorefinery approaches. The red basidiomycete yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides is a

32

promising and robust host for lipid and terpene derived chemicals. Previous studies

33

demonstrated assimilation of a range of substrates, from C5/C6-sugars to aromatic

34

molecules similar to lignin monomers. In the current study, we analyzed R. toruloides

35

potential to assimilate D-galacturonic acid, a major sugar in many pectin-rich agricultural

36

waste streams, including sugar beet pulp and citrus peels. D-galacturonic acid is not a

37

preferred substrate for many fungi, but its metabolism was found to be on par with

38

D-glucose

39

RNAseq/RB-TDNAseq revealed those genes with high relevance for fitness on

40

D-galacturonic

41

phosphorylative catabolic pathway known from ascomycetes, the maximal velocities of

42

several enzymes exceeded those previously reported. In addition, an efficient

43

downstream glycerol catabolism and a novel transcription factor were found to be

44

important for D-galacturonic acid utilization. These results set the basis for use of

45

R. toruloides as a potential host for pectin-rich waste conversions and demonstrate its

Importance
The switch from the traditional fossil-based industry to a green and sustainable

49

bio-economy demands the complete utilization of renewable feedstocks. Many currently

50

used bio-conversion hosts are unable to utilize major components of plant biomass,

51

warranting the identification of microorganisms with broader catabolic capacity and

52

characterization of their unique biochemical pathways. D-galacturonic acid is a plant

53

component of bio-conversion interest and is the major backbone sugar of pectin, a plant

54

cell wall polysaccharide abundant in soft and young plant tissues. The red

55

basidiomycete and oleaginous yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides has been previously

56

shown to utilize a range of sugars and aromatic molecules. Using state-of-the-art

57

functional genomic methods, physiological and biochemical assays, we elucidated the

58

molecular basis underlying the efficient metabolism of D-galacturonic acid. This study

59

identifies an efficient pathway for uronic acid conversion to guide future engineering

60

efforts, and represents the first detailed metabolic analysis of pectin metabolism in a

61

basidiomycete fungus.

Introduction
Negative environmental impacts from fossil fuel consumption and volatile energy

64

costs have accelerated academic and industrial efforts to develop sustainable

65

commodity chemicals and biofuels via microbial fermentation of renewable plant

66

biomass. Pectin-rich side streams from industrial processing of fruits and vegetables

67

have a strong potential as fermentation feedstocks, as they are stably produced in high

68

quantities and can be provided at low cost. Moreover, they accumulate centrally at their

69

respective processing plants, reducing transport costs, are partly pre-treated during the

70

processing, and are naturally devoid of lignin, being a major bottleneck in

71

depolymerization. Furthermore, second generation energy crops, such as agave and

72

sugar beet, have high levels of pectin; sometimes exceeding 40% of the dry weight (1,

73

2). Despite these major advantages, pectin-rich feedstocks are largely disposed of in

74

landfills and biogas plants or are sold as an inexpensive livestock feed after an energy-

75

intensive drying and pelleting process. Utilizing these waste streams for the biorefinery

76

would benefit the bioeconomy without augmenting current land-use and decrease the

77

contribution of these agricultural wastes to landfill overflow and environmental pollution

78

through airborne spores from molds, which thrive on pectin-rich waste (3, 4).

79

Pectin is the most heterogeneous of the major plant cell wall polysaccharides

80

and has four main structural classes: homogalacturononan (HG), rhamnogalacturonan I

81

(RG-I), and the substituted HGs rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II) and xylogalacturonan

82

(XG). α-(1,4)-linked D-galacturonic acid (D-galUA) is the major backbone sugar of all HG

83

structures and can comprise up to 70% of the polysaccharide. D-galUA is a uronic sugar

84

with the same hydroxyl configuration as D-galactose, but with a carboxylic acid group at

85

the C6 position. Other pectic monosaccharides include L-arabinose (L-ara), D-galactose

86

(D-gal), L-rhamnose (L-rha), and D-xylose (D-xyl) (5, 6).

87

The catabolic pathway for D-galUA utilization has not yet been characterized in

88

the Basidiomycota phylum. In ascomycetes, D-galUA is taken up by an MFS-type

89

transporter specific for uronic acids (7) and in a first step is reduced to L-galactonate by

90

a D-galUA reductase, which is either NADPH-specific or accepts either NADH or

91

NADPH, depending on the organism (8, 9). Next, L-galactonate is transformed into

92

3-deoxy-L-threo-hex-2-ulosonate by a dehydratase (10) and then into L-glyceraldehyde

93

and pyruvate by an aldolase (11). The last step of the reaction requires NADPH as a

94

cofactor and is catalyzed by a glyceraldehyde reductase which converts

95

L-glyceraldehyde

96

to glycerol, a central metabolite (12).

Rhodosporidium toruloides is a strong candidate for bioconversion of pectin-rich

97

waste streams. This basidiomycetous red yeast has been isolated from a wide variety of

98

pectin-rich substrates (e.g. oranges (13), grapes, olives (14) and sugar beet pulp (14,

99

15). R. toruloides can grow well on D-galUA as a sole carbon source (16), indicating an

100

efficient pathway for D-galUA metabolism. Furthermore, R. toruloides is of increasing

101

biotechnological interest as a host for bio-conversions. The yeast naturally accumulates

102

lipids and carotenoids, suggesting that it may be a promising host for the production of

103

terpene and lipid-based bio-products (17). Additionally, the yeast can co-utilize both

104

hexose and pentose sugars (18, 19) and assimilate aromatic compounds, such as

105

p-coumarate, derived from acylated lignins (20), suggesting advantages for efficient

106

carbon utilization over conventional lignocellulosic conversion hosts. Finally,

107

R. toruloides has advantages as a model system for basidiomycetes, as it is easily

108

manipulated in laboratory settings, whereas the basidiomycetes vast majority of known

109

basidiomycetes are difficult to cultivate (21). Furthermore, genetic analyses and mutant

110

strain development are becoming more efficient in R. toruloides as novel molecular

111

tools are being developed (22–25).

112

The aim of the present study was to characterize the D-galUA utilization pathway

113

of R. toruloides. Growth assays demonstrate this pathway is highly efficient in

114

comparison to the utilization of D-xyl or even D-glucose (D-glc). To identify all genes

115

involved in D-galUA catabolism, parallel RNAseq and whole-genome RB-TDNAseq

116

studies were performed (22). The enzymes for each metabolic step were subsequently

117

heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to verify their kinetic

118

properties in vitro. Furthermore, we identified transporters and a novel transcription

119

factor essential for D-galUA utilization. Finally, global carbon utilization trends underlying

120

the high efficiency of D-galUA catabolism are discussed. We believe the results from

121

this study offer crucial insights into basidiomycete D-galUA utilization and provide a

122

starting point for engineering of R. toruloides as a host for pectin-rich waste

123

bioconversion.

Results

125

R. toruloides IFO 0880 has a highly efficient D-galUA catabolism and can co-utilize

126

D-galUA

127

with D-glucose and D-xylose

Since it was known that R. toruloides can utilize both D-glc and D-xyl (18), we

128

tested how the assimilation of D-galUA would compare to these rates and whether

129

growth inhibition would be visible in mixed substrate cultures. To this end, R. toruloides

130

IFO 0880 was grown in 200 µl volume cultures with 50 mM each of these sugars as sole

131

carbon source as well as in cultures in which D-galUA was mixed with either D-glc or D-

132

xyl in a 1:1 ratio. Surprisingly, despite a slightly slower acceleration-phase on D-galUA

133

compared to D-glc in the first 24 hours, culture densities of R. toruloides reached almost

134

similar final ODs (Fig. 1A). Moreover, D-galUA was completely consumed by that time,

135

while total consumption of D-glc required about 70 hours (Fig. 1B). With this rate, growth

136

on D-galUA was faster than on D-xyl as the sole carbon source, which required about 80

137

hours to reach the same density and more than 90 hours to be completely consumed

138

(Fig. 1C,D). In mixed cultures of D-galUA and D-glc, D-glc consumption was accelerated

139

compared to single inoculations, indicating co-utilization of both sugars (Fig. 1B). The

140

same was true for the co-cultures of D-galUA and D-xyl (Fig. 1D). Also in this case, the

141

presence of D-galUA led to an acceleration of D-xyl assimilation, while the D-galUA

142

utilization was slightly delayed compared to the single inoculations.

143

Since the above experiments were performed at low concentrations of

144

monosaccharides, we performed an additional growth assay at 500 mM of substrate

145

and larger volume (50 mL) to resemble industrial settings with improved economics

146

(Fig. 2). The high sugar loadings were tolerated by R. toruloides, reaching similar ODs

D-galUA

utilization genes using differential RNAseq

We hypothesized that the genes involved in D-galUA utilization in R. toruloides

156

could be identified by analyzing the transcriptional response to media containing

157

D-galUA

158

glycerol. Therefore, after growth of R. toruloides IFO 0880 on either 2% D-galUA, 2%

159

glycerol or 2% D-glc, RNA was extracted during log growth phase and the transcriptome

160

analyzed by RNAseq. Overall, more than 2,000 genes displayed differential transcript

161

abundances between these three conditions, reflecting the significantly different

162

requirements for growth on these carbon sources (SI Table 1). Growth on D-galUA and

163

glycerol was more alike, in this respect, than growth on D-glc, as can be seen from the

164

condition clustering (Fig. 3). Hierarchical clustering furthermore separated the

165

differentially expressed genes into three clusters of 869 genes most highly expressed

166

on D-glc, 889 genes most highly expressed on glycerol and 625 genes most highly

167

expressed on D-galUA (Fig. 3). This last cluster included several genes with sequence

168

similarity to known enzymes participating in D-galUA catabolism in Aspergillus niger,

Identification of genes required for D-galUA metabolism using genome-wide fitness

171

profiling

172

To rapidly assess which R. toruloides genes are necessary for growth in

173

D-galUA,

we grew a sequence-barcoded random insertion library of R. toruloides

174

IFO 0880 on either 2% D-galUA, 2% gly or 2% D-glc similar to the RNAseq analysis

175

above. Insertions in genes necessary for growth in the respective carbon sources

176

should prevent or slow growth in those conditions, thus leading to a depletion in the

177

relative abundance of the sequence barcodes associated with those insertions (22).

178

T-DNA insertions in 28 genes led to significant growth defects on D-galUA versus D-glc,

179

and insertions in 20 genes led to significant growth defects on D-galUA versus glycerol

180

(Table 2; Fig. 4). After filtering for statistical significance, we combined our RNAseq data

181

and fitness profiling datasets to gain further insight into the metabolism of D-galUA. Only

182

seven genes had at least a 2-fold increase in transcript abundance on D-galUA and at

183

least a 2-fold decrease in abundance for insertional mutants on D-galUA compared to

184

glycerol and D-glc (Table 2). These genes included homologs to the previously

185

characterized D-galUA utilization pathways in A. niger (9) (GaaB, GaaC, and GaaD) and

186

T. reesei (GAR1; (8)). RTO4_9841, an MFS-type transporter related to pentose

187

transporters (e.g. LAT-1 in N. crassa; NCU02188) was also both transcriptionally

188

induced and required for robust growth on D-galUA, although other transporters were

189

also specifically induced on D-galUA and may therefore be involved in the transport of

190

D-galUA

191

factor (TF), was also induced by D-galUA, and insertional mutants were severely

192

deficient for growth on D-galUA, suggesting a primary role in regulating expression of

195

utilization enzymes. Finally, an ortholog of GAL7 was also induced and

Additional genes were identified to be required for utilization of D-galUA and

196

glycerol over D-glc (SI Table 2). These genes include members of the canonical

197

glycerol utilization pathway, GUT1 and GUT2, and the glycerol proton symporter, STL1,

198

the latter showing a modest, but statistically significant, growth defect on

199

glycerol. Mutants in homologs to members of the known carbon-catabolite regulating

200

AMPK/SNF1 protein kinase complex (a Mig1/CreA/CRE-1 repressor; SNF1, SNF4,

201

SIP2) (26) were also deficient for growth on one or both of these alternative carbon

202

sources, as were mutants in two G proteins (orthologs of S. cerevisiae CDC42 and

203

H. sapiens RAB6A) and likely interacting guanine exchange factors. Disruptions in

204

thiolation of some tRNA residues also consistently resulted in small, but significant,

205

fitness defects on D-galUA and glycerol, but not on D-glc, furthering evidence that this

206

process plays a role in nutrient sensing and carbon metabolism in diverse fungi (27, 28).

207

In vitro enzymatic characterization of the D-galUA catabolic proteins

208

Based on the data above and previous knowledge from ascomycetes, a model of

209

D-galUA

catabolism was hypothesized (Fig. 5). Intriguingly, a two-gene cluster was

210

observed in R. toruloides, similar to what was described in ascomycetes (9). However in

211

this case, the gaaC-homolog RTO4_12061 is not linked with the gaaA-homolog (which

212

is absent from the genome), but with RTO4_12062, the homolog of gaaB/lgd1 in

213

A. niger and T. reesei, respectively (Fig. 5A).

214

To confirm the corresponding enzyme activities, in vitro biochemical studies were

215

performed. The enzymes were heterologously expressed in E. coli and purified to

216

characterize their activity. The putative D-galUA reductase and GAR1-homolog

217

RTO4_11882 displayed clear D-galUA reduction activity with a KM of about 7 mM (Fig.

218

5B; Fig. S1A). The Vmax at saturating D-galUA concentrations was found to be

219

553 nkat/mg. A substrate scan revealed similarly high activities for this enzyme also on

220

glucuronic acid with only side activities on all other monosaccharides tested (Fig. 5C),

221

suggesting that RTO4_11882 represents a uronic acid reductase. In addition, the

222

enzyme was found to prefer NADPH as cofactor and showed much weaker activity with

223

NADH (data not shown). Dehydration of L-galactonate by the putative L-galactonate

224

dehydratase (RTO4_12062) was observed at a high Vmax of 2939 nkat/mg with a KM of

225

5.8 mM (Fig. 5B; Fig. S1B; (29)). Activity of the putative 3-deoxy-L-threo-hex-2-

226

ulosonate aldolase (RTO4_12061) was tested by monitoring the reverse reaction of

227

L-glyceraldehyde and pyruvate (Fig. 5B; Fig. S1C). Affinities and velocities for both

228

substrates were found to be very similar with a KM in the range of about 1 mM and Vmax

229

of about 510 nkat/mg (Fig. 5B). The putative L-glyceraldehyde reductase (RTO4_9774)

230

displayed Michaelis Menten kinetics of 0.9 mM with a Vmax of 535 nkat/mg for

231

L-glyceraldehyde

232

enzyme also appears to be a major pentose reductase of R. toruloides, since robust

233

activities were found for L-ara and D-xyl with KM’s in the range of 20-35 mM (Fig. 5D;

234

Fig. S1D). Lower activities were recorded for other sugars, such as the hexoses D-glc

235

and D-gal, the deoxy-hexose D-rha and the uronic acid D-glucuronic acid.

(Fig. 5B; Fig. S1D). A substrate scan interestingly revealed that this

236
237

Sugar reductase activities are induced by D-galUA in R. toruloides
In light of the previous observations, particularly regarding growth physiology and

238

enzymatic characterizations, we aimed to investigate which substrates are able to

239

induce monosaccharide reductase activity in R. toruloides in vivo. To this end,

240

reductase assays were performed with whole-cell lysates following growth for 24 h on

241

either D-xyl, D-galUA, D-glc or glycerol. The enzymatic activity of the cell lysates was

242

tested using D-xyl, D-galUA, D-glc and L-glyceraldehyde as substrates by measuring the

243

NADPH concentration loss over time. All lysates showed L-glyceraldehyde reductase

244

activity, albeit to a varying extent (Fig. 6). By contrast, D-galUA and D-glc reductase

245

activity were specific for the cultures grown on D-galUA. Intriguingly, while D-xyl

246

reductase activity was somewhat less specifically induced, growth on D-galUA clearly

247

led to the strongest induction. Considering that RTO4_9774 is induced about 5 to 7-fold

248

on D-galUA over glycerol and D-glc, respectively (Table 1 and 2), these results suggest

249

that a major part of the observed D-xyl reductase activities is contributed by RTO4_9774

250

functioning as pentose reductase. The same might be true for the low D-glc reductase

251

activity recorded specifically after induction on D-galUA. In addition, these activities

252

could help to explain the accelerated D-xyl and D-glc consumption in presence of

258

large fitness disadvantage for growth in D-galUA (Table 2 and Fig. 4), indicating that it

259

might be a key regulator for the catabolism of this carbon source. This novel TF belongs

260

to the same Gal4-like family as the known D-galUA-responsive TF from ascomycetes,

261

GaaR (30, 31) but is otherwise phylogenetically unrelated (Fig. 7A). We assessed

262

conservation of RTO4_13270 in basidiomycetes by searching for homologs in the

263

fungal proteomes from the Pucciniomycotina (to which R. toruloides belongs; Fig. 7B).

264

Overall, RTO4_13270 was found to be highly conserved in the

265

Rhodotorula/Rhodosporidium genus, still relatively conserved in closely related groups,

266

but not at all beyond the Pucciniomycotina.

267

Discussion

268

It has been shown that the red yeast, R. toruloides, exhibits strong growth on

269

pectin-derived monosaccharides, including D-galUA, D-xyl, L-ara and D-glc (18). Red

270

yeasts likely fill an opportunistic niche on pectic substrates and assimilate the

271

monosaccharides liberated by the enzymes of other microorganisms (32). For example,

272

Rhodotorula species were found to colonize grapes in the presence of other pectinolytic

273

fungi potentially releasing sugars from the fruit tissue (33). In this study, we

274

characterized the D-galUA utilization pathway of R. toruloides by a combination of

275

transcriptomics, genome-wide fitness profiling, and biochemical analysis of purified

276

enzymes.

277

R. toruloides utilizes a non-phosphorylative D-galUA catabolic pathway as

278

observed in ascomycete filamentous fungi (Fig. 8) (9). However, the R. toruloides

279

pathway is similar to the T. reesei pathway compared to the A. niger pathway due to the

absence of a GaaA homolog and the presence of a functional GAR1 homolog (Fig. 5)

281

(34). The conserved enzymes are highly induced by D-galUA, required for fitness and

282

shown to have the predicted biochemical activities for each catabolic step in vitro. When

283

comparing the catalytic activities to those reported for T. reesei and A. niger, the

284

substrate affinities (KM values) of the R. toruloides enzymes are for the most part

285

surprisingly similar (10, 8, 11, 35); Table S3). However, particularly for the dehydratase

286

RTO4_12062, the aldolase RTO4_12061 and the L-glyceraldehyde reductase

287

RTO4_9774, the maximal velocities are about 4 to 500-times higher, suggesting this

288

might contribute to the high efficiency of the pathway flux. Interestingly, the dehydratase

289

and aldolase are clustered in the genome, whereas the pathway reductases are found

290

elsewhere in the genome. Even though this genomic arrangement differs from the state

291

in the filamentous ascomycetes, where the aldolase (gaaC) forms a gene pair with the

292

initial D-galUA reductase (gaaA) (9), it may indicate that a tight co-regulation of the

293

enzyme expression (via a shared promotor region) is beneficial for the pathway as a

294

whole and for the aldolase in particular.

295

Another intriguing observation of our study was that the D-galUA catabolism led

296

to an enhanced co-utilization of D-glc and D-xyl, which are the most abundant hexose

297

and pentose sugars in plant biomass and therefore a primary target of biorefinery

298

concepts. This is notable, since it was shown that the presence of D-galUA (at low pH)

299

inhibits the assimilation of D-xyl, D-gal and L-ara in the commonly used fermentation

300

host S. cerevisiae, possibly via competitive inhibition of the main transporter Gal2p and

301

a general weak acid toxicity (36). Even though the used pH in this study was higher, the

302

high efficiency catabolism of D-galUA in R. toruloides may allow sufficient ATP to

303

overcome intracellular toxicity of pathway intermediates or proton efflux, whereas

304

S. cerevisiae is incapable of D-galUA assimilation without engineering (37–39).

305

Co-consumption of D-galUA with D-glc and D-xyl might furthermore benefit from

306

the multifunctional role of RTO4_9774 as mentioned above. RTO4_9774 is induced on

307

D-galUA,

help to assimilate these sugars under mixed culture conditions. Moreover, this

309

competition of sugars for available enzymes may explain the delay in D-galUA

310

consumption. Future experiments with the single gene deletions will help to address this

311

matter. Excitingly, the observation of sugar co-consumption at high sugar loadings is of

312

high biotechnological relevance for efficient mixed-sugar fermentations of pectin-rich

313

biomass.

314

and its additional activities as a pentose reductase and D-glc reductase will

The contribution of a specific D-galUA uptake system in R. toruloides to high flux

315

and low competition with other sugars can be potentially attributed to MFS-type

316

transporters. One MFS-type sugar transporter, RTO4_9841 (class 2.A.1.1;

317

http://www.tcdb.org), exhibited strong induction on D-galUA (mean FPKM of 4605), and

318

disruption of this gene resulted in a significant fitness defect. Interestingly, its close

319

homolog, RTO4_9846, which probably resulted from a recent duplication event, is also

320

induced on D-galUA, but did not cause a significant fitness defect and might therefore

321

represent a pseudogene (see Materials and Methods). Surprisingly, a phylogenetic

322

analysis and comparison with the better described MFS-transporters of class 2.A.1.1

323

from N. crassa (SI Fig. S2) shows that these transporters have higher sequence

324

homology to annotated arabinose transporters (i.e. LAT-1; (40), than to the GAT-1

325

family of D-galUA transporters found in ascomycetes. However, the relation of

326

RTO4_9841 and 9846 to pentose transporters and their function in D-galUA uptake is

327

currently unclear.

328

The combination of transcriptomics and functional genomics analysis identified

329

downstream components highly relevant for high D-galUA catabolism. Moreover, our

330

emerging model of D-galUA metabolism in R. toruloides may also serve as a road map

331

for the engineering of D-galUA pathways in other organisms. In particular, three genes

332

seem to be of high importance and received low fitness scores when disrupted by T-

333

DNA insertions: GUT1, GUT2, and FBP1. The first two genes encode for the enzymes

334

glycerol kinase and mitochondrial glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase that are

335

involved in the canonical glycerol metabolism pathway, as known from S. cerevisiae

336

and filamentous fungi (41–43). An efficient glycerol metabolism therefore appears

337

crucial for D-galUA assimilation. Moreover, since R. toruloides as an oleaginous yeast

338

has a highly efficient TAG biosynthesis and turnover, which is linked to glycerol

339

metabolism at the stage of glycerol-3-phosphate (G-3-P), the D-galUA metabolism might

340

hitchhike on these capacities and benefit from the high possible fluxes (44, 19). In

341

addition, the FAD-dependent oxidation of G-3-P to dihydroxyacetone phosphate

342

(DHAP) in the mitochondrial outer membrane by GUT2 may provide reducing power

343

necessary for the conversion of relatively oxidized D-galUA. This might be supported by

344

the participation of GUT2 in the G-3-P shuttle, which is involved in the maintenance of

345

the NAD:NADH redox balance for example in S. cerevisiae (45). The necessity of the

346

fructose-bisphosphatase (FBP1) for D-galUA utilization may suggest involvement of

347

gluconeogenesis. Further support for this hypothesis might be derived from the

348

essentiality of the SNF1 complex (all three subunits) for growth fitness on D-galUA. This

349

complex is highly conserved from yeast to humans, is an antagonist of carbon catabolite

350

repression, and promotes gluconeogenesis in the absence of D-glc (23). A proper

351

metabolic switch from D-glc to alternative carbon sources such as D-galUA, including

352

activation of gluconeogenesis, is thus a clear prerequisite for efficient growth in this

353

condition. It remains to be shown whether the newly identified TF RTO4_13270 is a

354

target of the SNF1 complex, since one of its main functions is to activate several TFs by

355

phosphorylation in yeast (46, 47). A downstream product of FBP1, glucose-6-

356

phosphate, also represents an entry gate into the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP),

357

which may be an additional way to generate the necessary reducing equivalents to

358

redox-balance the assimilation of D-galUA, an oxidized sugar acid substrate.

359

The characterization of the D-galUA catabolic pathway described in this work sets

360

the basis for use of R. toruloides as potential host for pectin-rich waste conversions.

361

The novel enzymes and transporters described here may furthermore be valuable for

362

biotechnological use in anaerobic microbes, such as S. cerevisiae. The present study

363

also demonstrates that the molecular tools now available for R. toruloides make it an

364

ideal model for the elucidation of basic biological concepts, such as carbon sensing,

365

signaling and substrate utilization (among many others), in basidiomycete fungi.

Materials and Methods

367

Strains

368

We used R. toruloides IFO0880 (also designated as NBRC 0880), which was

369

obtained from the NITE Biological Resource Center (https://www.nite.go.jp/nbrc/) for the

370

growth assays, transcriptional analysis and functional genomic analysis performed in

371

this study.

372

Culture conditions

373

Unless otherwise stated, R. toruloides IFO0880 cultures were grown at 30 °C in

374

50 mL liquid media in 250 mL baffled flasks with 250 rpm agitation on a shaker. For

375

strain maintenance rich media conditions, yeast peptone dextrose (YPD) media was

376

used supplemented with 2% (w/v) D-glc. For growth assays, IFO0880 was pre-cultured

377

in 0.68% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base w/o amino acids (Sigma-Aldrich, Y0626), pH 5.5 with

378

2% (w/v) D-glc for 4 days. Afterwards, cells were washed in YNB w/o carbon. YNB

379

cultures supplemented with the respective carbon source and 0.2% (w/v) ammonium

380

sulfate were inoculated with an initial OD600 of 0.1. For mixed cultures, substrates were

381

combined in equal amounts to the respective final concentration.

382

To investigate the growth of R. toruloides on different carbon sources, we

383

compared 50 mM D-glc, D-galUA and D-xyl as either a single carbon source or in

384

combination. Furthermore, growth on D-glc and D-galUA was also tested at a higher

385

concentration of 500 mM. Assays performed with 50 mM substrate concentration were

386

performed using sterile 96-well plates with cover. The plates were constantly shaken at

387

1000 rpm at 30 °C in a thermoblock. For assays with 500 mM substrate concentration,

At each time point of absorbance measurement, aliquots were taken and diluted

395

with water to a concentration of 1:100. The samples were centrifuged at for 4 min at

396

15.000 x g and 4°C. Subsequently, 400 µL of the supernatant was transferred into a

397

new Eppendorf tube. To determine the remaining sugar content, we used High pH

398

Anion Exchange Chromatography (HPAEC). Prior to measuring, aliquots of the

399

supernatants were further diluted to a final concentration of 1:5000. Quantification of

400

monosaccharides was performed as described in (48) and (7). For elution of neutral

401

monosaccharides, samples were injected into a 3 x 150 mm CarboPac PA20 column at

402

30 °C by using an isocratic mobile phase of 10 mM NaOH and a flowrate of 0.4 mL/min

411

then used to inoculate triplicate cultures in YNB plus 2% D-glc (Sigma-Aldrich,

412

G7528, St. Louis, MO), 2% D-galUA, and 2% glycerol (Sigma-Aldrich,

413

G5516, St. Louis, MO) at OD 0.1 in 100 mL cultures in 250 mL baffled flasks. Each

414

carbon source was then grown to the onset of stationary phase at OD 2.0.

415

Approximately 10 OD units were then pelleted and frozen at -80 °C for DNA extraction

416

and analysis. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Cat No.

417

74104) using on column DNA digestion (Qiagen, Cat No. 79254). RNAseq libraries

418

were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 system at the QB3 Vincent J. Coates

419

Genomic Sequencing Laboratory (http://qb3.berkeley.edu/gsl/) using standard mRNA

420

enrichment, library construction and sequencing protocols. Approximately 40 million

421

50 bp single-end reads were acquired per replicate per condition. Transcript

422

abundances and differential expression were calculated with HiSat 2.1.0, StringTie

To cluster genes with significant differential expression, genes with adjusted P-

427

values < 0.05 across all three conditions were filtered to remove genes with low

428

expression (FPKM < 5 in all conditions) and small fold changes (< 2-fold). FPKM values

429

were then clustered using Pearson correlation as the similarity metric and average

Barcode sequencing and Fitness Analysis
Fitness analysis of a pooled, barcoded R. toruloides T-DNA mutant library was

433

performed as described in (22) with minor alterations. Briefly, three aliquots of the

434

previously generated pool of random Agrobacterium tumefaciens insertional mutants

435

were thawed on ice then inoculated at OD (600 nm) 0.2 in 100 mL YPD

436

(BD Biosciences, BD242820, San Jose, CA) in a 250 mL baffled flask and incubated

437

8 hours at 30 °C, 200 rpm on a platform shaker. In this time the mutant pools reached

438

an OD 0.8. At this time a ‘time 0’ reference sample of the starter culture was collected

439

for all three replicates. Cultures were then pelleted by centrifugation at 3000 RCF at

440

room temperature for 5 minutes and washed twice with yeast nitrogen base (YNB)

441

(BD Biosciences, BD291940) media without carbon source. Each starter culture was

442

then used to inoculate new cultures in YNB plus 2% D-glc (Sigma-Aldrich,

443

G7528, St. Louis, MO), 0.2% D-glc, 2% D-galUA, 0.2% D-galUA, and 2% glycerol

444

(Sigma-Aldrich, G5516, St. Louis, MO) at OD 0.1 in 100 mL cultures in 250 mL baffled

445

flasks. Each carbon source was then grown to the onset of stationary phase (14, 14, 36,

446

19, and 64 hours respectively, with OD at sampling of 5, 1.3, 4.1, 0.8 and 1.9

447

respectively). Approximately 10 OD units were then pelleted and frozen at -80 °C for

were performed as described in (22).

453

YNB medium without carbon source, followed by 24 h of induction in 3 mL YNB with the

454

respective carbon source. A volume of 1 mL of the culture was centrifuged at 3.500 rpm

455

at 4 °C for 2 min to lyse the cells. The cell pellet was disrupted in 400 µL of lysis buffer

456

(50 mM NaOH, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) with 0.5 mm glass beads using a

457

laboratory bead mill (BeadBug Microtube homogenizer, SLG Gauting) for 1 min at

458

maximum speed and RT. For the determination of reductase activity by measuring the

459

loss of NADPH concentration over time, the complete supernatant after cell lysis was

460

used. The total reaction mixture of 100 µL contained 50 mM substrate (D-xyl, D-glc, D-

461

galUA or glycerol), 0.3 mM NADPH, 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7, 0.1 µL of

462

Tween20 and 50 µL of the different cell lysates. The assay was performed at 30 °C in

463

UV-compatible 96-well plates (Corning, Germany) in an Infinite® M200 PRO reader

464

(Tecan, Germany) for 5 min in total, measuring the optical density at 340 nm every 15

465

sec. Prior to each measurement, the plates were shaken for 5 sec.

In vitro activity assays

467

For activity determination of in vitro purified enzymes, RTO4_11882,

468

RTO4_12062, RTO4_12061, and RTO4_9774 were cloned into a custom-made HIS6-

469

TEV expression vector under control of a T7 promoter and transformed into E. coli

470

(Rosetta) cells. Protein expression was induced by using 1 mM IPTG at OD600 0.4 - 0.6

471

and cells incubated overnight at 16 °C and 250 rpm agitation before harvesting by

472

centrifugation at 4 °C. For lysis, cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (see above),

473

20 mg/mL lysozyme was added and the suspension incubated for 1 h at 37 °C rotating

474

at 10 rpm. After 30 min and 45 min of incubation, 2.5 µL of DNase I was added. Cell

475

debris was precipitated by centrifugation at 16.000 x g and 4 °C for 20 min. The

476

supernatant was used for protein purification by immobilized metal-affinity

477

chromatography (IMAC) (50). Chosen elutions were desalted in Vivaspin columns

478

(10,000 Da MW cutoff; Sartorius, Germany) with storage buffer (20 mM sodium

479

phosphate, 20 mM NaCl, pH 7) by centrifugation at 3.000 x g and 4 °C.

480

The affinity tag of the putative L-galactonate dehydratase was removed by

481

incubation with an in-house purified and His-tagged TEV protease (ratio 40:1 (mg:mg))

482

overnight at 4 °C. In a second IMAC, the tag-free protein was collected in the flow

483

through and desalted as described above. Protein concentrations were determined with

484

a Bradford assay using Roti®-Quant reagent (Roth, Germany) and a BSA calibration

485

series. The enzymatic activity of the two reductases was determined as described

486

above, but with a total reaction volume of 200 µl and 1 – 2 µg purified protein instead of

487

cell lysates.

488

For RTO4_12061, a thiobarbiturate assay according to (51) was performed. To

489

this end, 200 µl reaction mix (50 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 60 mM pyruvate

490

and varying L-glyceraldehyde concentrations or 25 mM L-glyceraldehyde and varying

491

pyruvate concentrations) were mixed with 3.3 µg protein. Samples were removed during

492

the linear range of the reaction, stopped and developed as described, but with half the

493

quantities.

494

For RTO4_12062, a modified semicarbazide assay was performed (29). 1 µg

495

enzyme was mixed with different L-galactonate concentrations in 5 mM MgCl2 and 50

496

at 16.000 x g and 4 °C for 10 min. 40 µl of the supernatant were pipetted to 160 µl

499

semicarbazide solution (1 % (w/v) semicarbazide, 1 % (w/v) sodium acetate) and

500

incubated at RT for 30 min. The absorbance was measured at 250 nm in UV-compatible

galactono-1,4-lactone (Sigma, Germany) in water, and adding sodium hydroxide until

503

the pH stopped changing and could be set to pH 7 with 1 M sodium phosphate.

Synteny identification

505

Protein sequences of GAR1, GAR2, LGD1, LGA1 and GLD1 from Trichoderma

506

reesei were acquired from The Universal Protein Resource (UniProt;

507

https://www.uniprot.org/) databases. Sequences were compared by BLASTp

508

(https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) with T. reesei sequences from FungiDB

509

(http://fungidb.org/fungidb/) and the results illustrating 100% sequence identity were

510

chosen for determination of scaffolds, strand orientation (+ or - strand) and genomic

511

DNA sequence (from ATG to STOP codon). Aspergillus niger protein sequences of

512

gaaA, gaaB, gaaC, gaaD were acquired from FungiDB. The GAR2 sequence of

T. reesei (from Uniprot) was used to determine the A. niger ortholog in FungiDB by

514

using BLASTp. Their strand orientation (+ or – strand), position on the chromosomes,

521

DNA sequence length of all genes was determined to create an approximation of the

compared to all entries in the Pucciniomycotina tree of MycoCosm by using BLASTp.

526

The best hit of each sub-group was taken and their BLAST score was used to

determine homology. The phylogeny of the Pucciniomycotina was taken from

528

MycoCosm and modified with the results from the homology search.

529

Phylogenetic analyses

530

The protein sequences of RTO4_11882, RTO4_12062, RTO4_12061 and

531

RTO4_9774 from IFO 0880 v4 were retrieved from MycoCosm (http://jgi.doe.gov/fungi)

532

and compared to their homologs in T. reesei and A. niger. Additionally, the conservation

533

of these genes between R. toruloides and representative basidiomycete organisms was

534

determined by phylogenetic analysis. Amino acid sequences of T. reesei and A. niger

535

were retrieved from UniProt and FungiDB, respectively, as described in the previous

536

section. The protein sequences of the basidiomycete organisms were retrieved from

537

MycoCosm by running BLASTp of the R. toruloides genes against the Basidiomycota

538

tree. Genes with high sequence similarity and from representative families were used

539

for the following analyses. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using Clustal Omega

540

(https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/) (52–54). The design was finalized using

541

FigTree v1.4.3 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/) to create a rectangular tree

542

with increasing node ordering and branches transformed to cladogram.

543

Similarly, R. toruloides proteins annotated as sugar porters or MFS-type by Pfam

544

(http://pfam.xfam.org/) (55–59) were analyzed using the transporter categories

545

database (TCDB; http://www.tcdb.org/) (60). Amino acid sequences of R. toruloides

546

proteins classified as category 2.A.1.1 (sugar porter family) were retrieved from

547

MycoCosm and compared to sequences of N. crassa OR74a transporter proteins of

548

TCDB category 2.A.1.1 (60), which were gathered from FungiDB. For RTO4_9846, due

549

to doubts about correct annotation, an alternative gene model was proposed and used

550

for the phylogenetic analysis. The gene model can be found at:

551

https://genome.jgi.doe.gov/cgi-bin/dispGeneModel?db=Rhoto_IFO0880_4&id=9846. As

552

above, a phylogenetic tree was created with Clustal Omega using these sequence data.

553

The tree was finalized using FigTree v1.4.3 with a polar tree layout, increasing node

554

ordering and branches transformed to cladogram.

Figure 4. Plotting relative fitness scores versus differential expression of D-galUA grown R. toruloides
identifies genes with essential function in n d-galUA utilization. Genes with significant differential
expression had a minimum FPKM > 5, at least a two-fold difference in average FPKM between the two
plotted conditions, and a multiple-hypothesis adjusted P-value < 0.05, as calculated across D-galacturonic
acid (D-galUA), glycerol (gly), and D-glucose (D-glc) with the Ballgown analysis package for R. Genes with
a relative fitness defect had relative T-statistics < -3 between conditions and relative fitness scores < -1
between the two plotted conditions. (A) Relative fitness scores vs relative transcript abundance for D-galUA
vs gly grown cells. Catabolic pathway genes homologous to the A. niger and T. reesei utilization pathways
(GAR1, GAAB, GAAC and GAAD), a MFS sugar transporter and zinc-finger transcription factor are clearly
induced and required for fitness on D-galUA. (B) Relative fitness scores vs relative transcript abundance
for D-galUA vs D-glc grown cells, illustrating additional pathways involved in D-galUA metabolism. Glycerol
catabolism genes, such as GUT1 and GUT2 are found to be induced and required for fitness when grown
on D-galUA compared to D-glc.

SI Figure S1. Protein purification and Michaelis Menten kinetics of the recombinant D-galUA catabolism
pathway enzymes. His-tagged proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified via IMAC; expected molecular
weight and purity were determined by SDS-PAGE. Lane descriptions: M = 2 - 212 kDa broad range protein
ladder (NEB, Germany), L = load, F = flow, W = wash, T = TEV digest, E = elutions. In vitro enzymatic
assays were performed to determine the Michaelis Menten kinetics of the enzymes. (A) The activity of
RTO4_11882 with an expected protein size of 37.1 kDa was assessed by measuring the loss of NADPH
over time. (B) Recombinant RTO4_12062 has an expected protein size of 55.7 kDa (his-tagged) or
53.1 kDa (untagged after TEV cleavage). Activity was determined by a semicarbazide assay. (C)
RTO4_12061 has a predicted size of 36.4 kDa and the in vitro activity was determined in the reverse
direction with the thiobarbiturate (TBA) assay. The two substrates were L-glyceraldehyde and pyruvate. (D)
For RTO4_9774, with an expected protein size of 38.0 kDa, the NADPH loss during reduction of
L-glyceraldehyde, L-arabinose and D-xylose was measured. Shown data points are the mean of triplicate
measurements (n=3). Kinetics data were plotted with the IC50 Tool Kit (http://www.ic50.tk/).
